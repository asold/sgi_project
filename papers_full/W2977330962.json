INTRODUCTION\nSynchronous Phasor Measurement Units have been widely\ndeployed and utilized in today’s high voltage transmission\npower grids. With high reporting rates and accurate GPS\ntimestamps, these devices enable real-time system moni-\ntoring and analysis [1]. Applications are widely deployed\nbased on PMU measurements for system modeling [2], fault\nlocating [3], and state estimation [4], etc. The fundamental\ndata provided by PMUs are voltage and current measure-\nments obtained mostly from protection-type transducers: CTs\nand PTs installed throughout the network. Their measuring\nprocess of scaling down high voltage/current will inevitably\nintroduce ratio errors. These errors, described in the IEEE\nStd C57.13 standards [5], distort the information of the sys-\ntem’s instantaneous operating conditions illustrated by the\nmeasurements. One of the practical ways to resolve the ratio\nerror is to utilize revenue type CTs/PTs. However, they are\ntoo costly to be applied across the entire system.\nFurthermore, most utilities only collect PS data from\ninstalled PMUs. These PS measurements are computed from\nthree-phase CT/PT measurements affected individually by\nthe aforementioned ratio errors. In addition, due to the exis-\ntence of un-transposed TLs, three-phase unbalance also has a\nnegative impact on the accuracy of the measurements. This\npaper intends to resolve this error issue by developing a\nsoftware-based method to ﬁnd out the errors within the PS\nPMU measurements and to further estimate the system TL\nparameters for a more accurate system model.\nThere exist several studies focusing on the errors in\nPMU measurements. Reference [6] provides a comprehen-\nsive study to estimate PMU measurement errors using a\nnonlinear optimal estimation theory. The impact of the PMU\nmeasurement errors on the system dynamic load model is\ndescribed and the stochastic distribution, as well as the\nfrequency spectrum of the error, are analyzed in [7]. In refer-\nence [8], the PMU measurements errors are found to inﬂu-\nence the system modeling in the steady state. To resolve\nthis problem, the LSE is used to conduct calibration con-\nsidering different PMU installation cases. Researchers also\nproposed estimating the CT and PT’s ratio errors using\nPMU measurements [9]. Pal et al., used a three-phase line\nmodel to calibrate the potential transformers with more\naccurate measurements [10]. However, most of the stud-\nies take PMUs as perfect information transferring media\nand ignore the loss of accuracy due to analog-to-digital\nconversion.\nThe researchers mentioned above also assumed the\nTL parameters are accurate and invariant from the time\nof installation. However, the line parameters are signiﬁ-\ncantly inﬂuenced by operation conditions and environment.\nZhang et al. [11] recognized this effectiveness, proposed a\nmethod to identify the suspicious erroneous line parame-\nters and then estimate these parameters as states. However,\nthis method highly depends on the accuracy of the errors\nidentiﬁcation. There have also been other methods proposed\nto estimate transmission line parameters considering PMU\nerrors from perspectives of both transmission level [12] and\ndistribution level [13]. Reference [14] introduces a method to\nestimate one single TL’s parameters using recursive regres-\nsion based on a Kalman ﬁlter. Reference [15] introduced\na novel estimator to estimate the three-phase parameters\nof a single TL. An off-line methodology has been pro-\nposed in [16], which can estimate the single TL parameters\nwith only one side of the line equipped with one PMU.\nWu et al. [17] have proposed an algorithm attempting to\nestimate both the three-phase line parameters and the ratio\nerrors of the CTs/PTs. However, this method is aimed at\nperfectly balanced three-phase system and does not pro-\nvide an effective method for the topological measurement\npropagation. More importantly, the paper does not consider\nthe PMU quantization error and simply uses CTs/PTs ratio\nerrors as the error of the PMU measurements. Researchers\nin [18] focused on un-transposed TL’s parameters estimation.\nThey combined the system state estimation and the three-\nphase line parameters real-time tracking. Gaussian white\nnoise is used to simulate the PMU measurement errors. The\nCTs/PTs calibration and TL parameters estimation problem\nis also considered in [19]. Researchers derived the estima-\ntion problem by taking CT/PT errors as probabilistic vari-\nables. While in the process of extending the estimation\nto the whole network, the researchers used regular LSE\nmethod to ﬁnd the current measurements errors and did not\nconsider the irregular scenarios like parallel transmission\nlines.\nVOLUME 7, 2019 145105\nC. Wanget al.: Transmission Lines Positive Sequence Parameters Estimation and Instrument Transformers Calibration\nThe aim of this paper is to provide power utilities equipped\nwith a limited number of revenue CTs and PTs with a method\nto ﬁnd more accurate PS parameters of the TLs throughout\nthe system and to calibrate all the non-revenue CTs and PTs\nwith data analytic automation process. The whole process\nstarts with revenue transducers installed on one single bus\nin the system and the estimation of line parameters and\ncurrent/voltage measurement errors is conducted on TLs one\nby one throughout the grid.\nThe main contributions of this paper include:\n1) A more realistic PMU PS measurement error model\nwas formulated and deployed other than the normal\ndistribution assumption on errors used in previous\nstate/parameters estimation researches [20], [21]. The\nPMU measurement errors for PS voltages and currents\nmeasurements are analyzed based on which this model\nis proposed for further more realistic estimation method\nconstruction.\n2) A novel algorithm is proposed to estimate PS param-\neters of transposed/un-transposed TLs and ratio errors\nof the corresponding CTs and PTs. Unlike [12], [22],\nthe PS line parameters are estimated without directly\nusing the LSE method but integrating a novel technic\nto consider more detailed PMU measurement errors\ncharacteristics.\n3) A set of more adaptive propagation methods than [17],\n[19] are proposed to transmit the accuracy to the con-\nsecutive lines as the reference of the estimation of\ntheir parameters. The proposed method considers more\ncomprehensive scenarios like parallel lines to make the\npropagation method more robust.\n4) The edge-based breadth-ﬁrst search algorithm is pro-\nposed to identify the sequence of the TLs to be esti-\nmated. As in previous studies [15], [17], the accuracy\npropagation methods were usually not discussed in\ndetail. The introduction of this method provides a sys-\ntematic way to ﬁnd the system topology to propagate\nthe accuracy acquired with the single TL estimation\nthroughout the whole network.\nThis paper is organized as follows: Section II presents the\nTL model and PMU measurement error model utilized in\nthe following analysis; Section III describes the methodology\nof estimating PS line parameters of single TLs, transduc-\ners calibration, and the propagation algorithms; Section IV\npresents the case study results; Section V concludes the\narticle.\nII. TRANSMISSION LINE AND PMU MEASUREMENT\nERROR MODEL\nThe actual estimation is conducted on every single TL, which\nis modeled with the widely used PS π-section model. The\nCTs/PTs, with PMUs, are placed on both ends of the line.\nFor better estimation effectiveness, the characteristics of the\nerror integrated by these devices are to be analyzed. The\nknowledge of these characteristics forms the foundation for\nfurther methodology establishment.\nFIGURE 1. Transmission lineπ-section model and CT/PT measurements.\nFIGURE 2. Voltage and current measurement data flow.\nA. TRANSMISSION LINEπ-SECTION MODEL\nThe widely used TL model consists of PS line parameters:\nR, X, and y, as is shown in Figure 1. In the ﬁgure, it can be\nseen that the measured values of voltages and currents from\nboth ends of the TL are different from the actual values. The\nTL impedance is Z =R +jX.\nB. PMU MEASUREMENTS ERROR MODEL\nThe PMU measurements utilities use are mostly in PS. These\ndata are transformed from three-phase measurements and\nquantized by ADC inside the PMUs. This conversion process\ncan cause loss of information. On the other hand, the accuracy\nof these measurements also depends on the original measur-\ning devices (CTs/PTs). Therefore, it is important to ﬁnd out\nthe characteristics of these errors along with the data ﬂowing\nprocess. Given knowledge of these error features, the basis\nis built for more realistic PMU measurement simulation and\nfurther parameter estimation.\n1) MEASUREMENTS DATA FLOW\nAs shown in Figure 2, the actual voltages and currents on\nevery single TL are measured by the CTs/PTs. Because of\nthe core excitation current in the scaling down process, ratio\nerrors are introduced. After receiving the signals from CTs\nand PTs, PMUs quantize each phase data and compute the\nPS voltage or current phasors, which also causes loss of\nprecision.\nBoth the three-phase and PS ratio errors are complex val-\nues. The relationship among true values, measurements, and\n145106 VOLUME 7, 2019\nC. Wanget al.: Transmission Lines Positive Sequence Parameters Estimation and Instrument Transformers Calibration\nratio errors on bus k is shown in (1).\n{\nVkM =REVk ×Vk\nIkM =REIk ×Ik\n(1)\nFor each phase, there is a different ratio error. Since these\nerrors mainly depend on the CTs/PTs hardware, it can be\nassumed that during the time period of concern, such ratio\nerrors remain ﬁxed. According to [18], the ratio errors for\neach single phase is as follows :\nREVph =rM,ph ×ejrA,ph×π/180 , ph ∈{A , B , C} (2)\nThe PMUs take the individual three-phase values as input\nand computes PS values. Therefore, without losing general-\nity, taking voltage as an example, the PS voltage measure-\nments would be as follows :\nVPM =1\n3\n(\nREVA ·VA +α·REVB ·VB+α2 ·REVC ·VC\n)\n(3)\nwhere, α=ej2π/3.\nIf the three-phase voltage measurements are balanced,\nthe PS ratio error, REVP, can be computed as\nREVP =VPM\nVP\n=\n(1/\n3\n)\n(REVA +REVB +REVC ) (4)\nHowever, in reality, there do exist some cases where TLs\nare un-transposed, which can cause three-phase imbalances\nin the measurements. Under such circumstances, the three-\nphase deviations from the PS are introduced and thus the PS\nratio error becomes :\nREVP,ut =βA ·REVA +βB ·REVB +βC ·REVC\nβA +βB +βC\n(5)\nIt is to be noted that as the three phases’ ratio errors and\nthe transposing condition of each TL remain constant, there\nis a constant PS ratio error for each set of three-phase PMU\nmeasurements.\n2) PMU QUANTIZATION ERROR\nThe quantization behavior of the three-phase PMU output\ndata is described in [10], [23]. All three-phase voltage and\ncurrent data received by PMUs are quantized by certain scales\ndue to the analog-to-digital conversion [24]. Since the PS\nmeasurements are directly transformed from the quantized\nthree-phase data, the quantization errors are also indiscrim-\ninately integrated. Given that many estimators deployed in\nutilities only consider PS network, these errors can lead to\ninaccurate or even incorrect system states and parameters\nidentiﬁcation.\nThe PS measurement errors caused by the three-phase\nquantization cannot be simply taken as an additive error\nbecause of the PS transformation process. Here, the simulated\nthree-phase voltage data are quantized and taken as an exam-\nple to demonstrate the effect of the PS transformation after\nquantization. 7,500 times of power ﬂow are conducted based\non an equal number of system load statuses in one morning\nload pick-up hour chronologically. The three-phase voltage\nFIGURE 3. Simulated positive sequence and three-phase voltage\nquantization errors distribution histogram.\nphasors on one single bus are collected. The quantization\nerrors of each single-phase data are simply the differences\nbetween the original phasors and the quantized ones. Real and\nimaginary parts are quantized separately. The voltage level\nis 345KV and the quantization scale which is 12.16V. For\nthe PS, the true PS phasors are transformed with true three-\nphase data and the quantized PS phasors are transformed with\nquantized three-phase data. The PS quantization errors are the\ndifferences between them.\nThe histogram of the quantization errors of three-phase and\nPS voltage data are shown in Figure 3. The histogram bin is\nset to be 1/20 of the quantization scale. As can be seen in\nFigure 3, the quantization process causes losing accuracy of\nthe three-phase measurements due to the quantization errors.\nFor both real and imaginary parts of the three-phase voltage\ndata (‘‘V A real quant error’’ and so on), the quantization\nerrors are uniformly distributed in general. As for the PS\ndata (‘‘VP real quant error’’ and so on), the errors show bell\nshapes brought by the sum of three uniform distributions [25].\nNotably, the expectation of this error is close to zero and\ntherefore unbiased. The existence of quantization errors in\nthe PS measurements clearly shows that these errors cannot\nbe ignored within any estimation process using these data.\nTherefore, in the following section, a series of estimation\nmethods is designed to resolve these errors taking advantage\nof their unbiased characteristic.\nIII. LINE PARAMETERS ESTIMATION METHODOLOGY\nWith the knowledge of the PMU measurement errors charac-\nteristics, a linear estimation methodology based on the LSE\nis proposed to estimate the line parameters and to calibrate\nVOLUME 7, 2019 145107\nC. Wanget al.: Transmission Lines Positive Sequence Parameters Estimation and Instrument Transformers Calibration\nthe transducers. The methodology consists of two parts: sin-\ngle TL estimation and accuracy propagation. The process\nstarts with one single TL in the network. On its ‘‘ From bus’’,\nit is assumed that there is one set of revenue class CTs and\nPTs installed. The voltage and current measurements on this\nbus are accurate and are taken as the reference for the whole\nestimation process.\nGiven the accurate measurements on the ‘‘ From bus’’, one\ncan estimate line parameters and the ratio errors within the\nmeasurements on the ‘‘ To bus’’ at the same time. Different\nfrom [17], during this single line estimation, the PMU quan-\ntization errors are considered.\nSince the ‘‘ To bus’’ of the currently concerned line is also\nthe ‘‘From bus’’ of the consecutive line, detailed techniques\nare developed to propagate the accuracy to the next TL for\nparameter estimation. Thus, following the connected system\ntopology, parameters of all the concerned lines can be esti-\nmated.\nA. SINGLE TRANSMISSION LINE PARAMETERS\nESTIMATION MODEL\nBased on the π-section model shown in Figure 1, one can ﬁnd\nthe relationship between the true PS voltages/currents and the\nline parameters as shown in (6).\n[Vi\nVj\n]\n=Z\n[Ii\nIj\n]\n(6)\nwhere, the impedance matrix is\nZ = 1\ny (2 +Zy)\n[1 +Zy 1\n1 1 +Zy\n]\n(7)\nFor the simplicity of the expression, the correction factors\nKVi, KIi, KVj, and KIj are introduced. These variables are\nthe reciprocals of the respective ratio errors and thus are\nequivalent. Using the products of the CT/PT measurements\nand correction factors to substitute the true values, (6) can be\nreformulated to be (8).\n[KVi ×ViM\nKVj ×VjM\n]\n=Z ·\n[KIi ×IiM\nKIj ×IjM\n]\n(8)\nHere, the ‘ideal’ PS measurements ViM , IiM , VjM , and\nIjM are the values acquired by the transformation of direct\nthree-phase measurement. As mentioned before, the ADCs\nin PMUs are designed to quantize the three-phase mea-\nsurements before conducting this transformation. Therefore,\nthe actual PS data provided by PMUs are transformed\nfrom quantized three-phase measurements. The differences\nor namely the PS quantization errors are\n{\nεVkM =VkM −VkM,q\nεIkM =IkM −IkM,q\n(9)\nTherefore, by introducing a new assisting variable\nW =1 +Z ·y, (8) can be written as\n[ViM,q +εViM\nVjM,q +εVjM\n]\n=ˆZ ·\n[IiM,q +εIiM\nIjM,q +εIjM\n]\n(10)\nwhere,\nˆZ = 1\ny (W +1)\n\n\nW KIi\nKVi\nKIj\nKVi\nKIi\nKVj\nW KIj\nKVj\n\n (11)\nBy reformulating (10), one has\n[ViM,q\nVjM,q\n]\n=ˆZ ·\n[IiM,q\nIjM,q\n]\n−\n[εViM\nεVjM\n]\n+ˆZ ·\n[εIiM\nεIjM\n]\n  \nε\n(12)\nBased on the previous analysis, the quantization errors\nare unbiased. Therefore, the expectation of the quantization\nerrors part, ε, in the RHS of (12) should be a zero vector,\nwhich means\nmean (ε)→−\n[E\n[\nεViM\n]\nE\n[\nεVjM\n]\n]\n+ˆZ ·\n[E\n[\nεIiM\n]\nE\n[\nεIjM\n]\n]\n=\n[0\n0\n]\n(13)\nThus, with adequate measurements to eliminate the quan-\ntization errors, the linear estimation problem can be formed\nas shown in (14).\n[IiM,q IjM,q\n]\n·ˆZT =\n[ViM,q VjM,q\n]\n−εT (14)\nwhere, ViM,q =\n[\nV (1)\niM,q V (2)\niM,q ··· V (N)\niM,q\n]T\n, which is the\nvector of N time-stamped, quantized voltage measurements\nprovided by the PMU installed on bus i. The VjM,q, IiM,q,\nand IjM,q are similar.\nUsing LSE and the single line parameters model formed\nin (14), one can get the estimated impedance matrix :\nˆZT =\n(\nIT\nM,qIM,q\n)−1\nIT\nM,qVM,q −\n(\nIT\nM,qIM,q\n)−1\nIT\nM,qεT (15)\nwhere, IM,q =\n[IiM,q IjM,q\n]\nand VM,q =\n[ViM,q VjM,q\n]\n.\nTherefore, multiple times of LSE are to be performed using\ndifferent sets of the original PMU data, instead of using the\ncomplete dataset at once. Taking advantage of the error’s\nunbiased characteristic, the average of the multiple estimation\nresults is used to eliminate the second part in RHS of (15).\nThe ﬁnal estimation results can be reached using only the\nquantized data, as shown in (16).\nˆZT\nﬁnal =\nP∑\nk=1\nˆZT\nk\n/\nP (16)\nwhere,\nˆZT\nk =\n[(\nI(i)\nM,q\n)T\nI(i)\nM,q\n]−1 (\nI(i)\nM,q\n)T\nV(i)\nM,q (17)\nwhich is the estimation results based on the k-th portion of the\ndata when the original data set is partitioned into P portions.\nWith the entries of ˆZﬁnal: ˆZ11, ˆZ12, ˆZ21, and ˆZ22, the esti-\nmated impedance and susceptance can be calculated by ﬁrst\ncomputing the estimated ˆW :\nˆW =\n√(\nˆZ11 ×ˆZ22\n)/(\nˆZ21 ×ˆZ12\n)\n(18)\n145108 VOLUME 7, 2019\nC. Wanget al.: Transmission Lines Positive Sequence Parameters Estimation and Instrument Transformers Calibration\nGiven the correction factors of the voltage and current\nmeasurements of the bus i, namely KVi and KIi, the correction\nfactors on bus j can be estimated as follow.\n\n\n\nKVj =\n(1/ˆW\n)(\nˆZ11/ˆZ21\n)\nKVi\nKIj = ˆW\n(\nˆZ21/ˆZ12\n)\nKIi\n(19)\nThe transducers installed on bus j are thus calibrated.\nThen the estimated line impedance and susceptance can be\ncalculated as shown in (20) and (21).\nˆy =\n√ 1\ndet\n(\nˆZﬁnal\n)· KIiKIj\nKViKVj\n·\n(\nˆW −1\n)\n(\nˆW +1\n) (20)\nˆZ =1\nˆy\n(\nˆW −1\n)\n(21)\nThe single line parameters are estimated. Notably, line\nsusceptances should always be positive. Hence, in (20), the\npositive imaginary part of the square roots is taken as the\nestimated susceptance.\nAs found in the numerical experiments, one factor that\naffects the estimation accuracy is the lack of variance on the\nPMU measurements when collected within a continuous time\nperiod. Such numerical characteristics could easily result in\nsingularity during the computation process. Here we used a\ntechnique to avoid this problem taking advantage of PMUs’\nhigh reporting rate. For instance, we use one-hour data to con-\nduct the estimation. Only the data measured in the ﬁrst second\nof each minute are used and combined to form the estimation\ndataset. The PMU output frame rate is set to be 30 frames/sec.\nSo the dataset contains 1800 time instances in total. As for\nthe data partitioning for the results averaging process, all the\n1st measurement frames of each second are used to form the\n1st portion, all the 2nd frames to form the 2nd portion, etc.\nHence, there are 30 datasets in total for each TL and the\nestimation is conducted 30 times with 60 time frames each\ntime. The time period settings for raw data collection used\nhere is user-deﬁned. This setting can be shorter for more\nprompt estimation results, as long as adequate measurements\ncan be provided. Therefore, the data selection manner is only\nprovided for reference and should not affect the practicality\nof the implementation in reality.\nB. PROPAGATION METHODOLOGY\nFor one single TL, the correction factors of CTs and PTs\non the ‘‘To bus’’ can be estimated using the aforemen-\ntioned method. Since the current TL shares this ‘‘To bus’’\nwith its consecutive TLs, a method is developed to propa-\ngate the estimated correction factors to these TLs. There-\nfore, starting from the reference bus where a set of revenue\nCTs and PTs deployed, one can conduct the estimation on\neach TL sequentially throughout the interconnected system\ntopology.\nFIGURE 4. Voltage measurements on one single bus.\n1) VOLTAGE ACCURACY PROPAGATION\nThe voltages on one bus measured on different TLs connect to\nit should be the same. So if there are n lines that are connected\nto bus i as shown in Figure 4, the voltages measured by\ndifferent PTs on those lines should satisfy (22).\nV (true)\ni =KV (1)\ni ×V (1)\niM =KV (2)\ni ×V (2)\niM =···= KV (n)\ni ×V (n)\niM\n(22)\nwhere, the superscript ‘ true’ indicates the true value of the\nmeasurement; the other superscripts indicate which line the\nmeasurement or correction factor is corresponded to.\nConsidering the quantization effect, the quantized mea-\nsurements can be found following this relationship :\nV (true)\ni =KV (1)\ni ×\n(\nV (1)\niM,q −ε(1)\nViM\n)\n=KV (2)\ni ×\n(\nV (2)\niM,q −ε(2)\nViM\n)\n=···= KV (n)\ni ×\n(\nV (n)\niM,q −ε(n)\nViM\n)\n(23)\nIf one of the correction factors, KV (j)\ni , is known from the\ncalibration of the previous line, for any of the other correction\nfactors, KV (k)\ni , one has\nKV (j)\ni ×V (j)\niM,q =KV (k)\ni ×V (k)\niM,q −KV (k)\ni ×ε(k)\nViM +KV (j)\ni ×ε(j)\nViM  \nεV\n(24)\nBecause of the unbiased characteristic of the quantization\nerror, i.e. E [εV ] = 0, one can use a similar technique as\nshown in subsection II-A to ﬁnd KV (k)\ni .\n2) CURRENT ACCURACY PROPAGATION\nApart from the accurate voltage measurement, the accurate\ncurrent measurements on the same bus also need to be prop-\nagated to form the reference bus for the consecutive line.\nBased on Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL), the currents\ninjections on the bus i can be expressed as (25):\nKI(1)\ni ×I(1)\niM +KI(2)\ni ×I(2)\niM +···+ KI(n)\ni ×I(n)\niM =0 (25)\nGiven that one of the correction factors, KI(1)\ni , is known,\n(25) can be rewritten as (26). Such model forms another LSE\nVOLUME 7, 2019 145109\nC.

B. 1), the ratio errors have limits\non magnitude and angle. Therefore, the correction factors’\nvalues should be bounded constrained. These constraints are\nin the form of magnitude and angles. But within the com-\nputation process, the ratio errors are calculated in the form\nof complex numbers. The constraints are projected from the\npolar coordinate plane into the complex plane and transferred\nfrom three single-phases into PS. The calculated constraints\nof the correction factors are shown in (28).\n\n\nKreal ∈\n[\n0.9452,1.0526\n]\nKimag ∈\n[\n−0.1005,0.1005\n] (28)\nHowever, the constraints derived are in the real plane, while\nthe estimation model as shown in (26) is in the complex plane.\nIn order to take these limits into consideration, the model is\nreformed as (29), (30), and (31).\nIreshape =[real(I(2)\niM,q) , imag(I(2)\niM,q) , ··· , real(I(n)\niM,q),\nimag(I(n)\niM,q)] (29)\nIreshape[real(KI(2)\ni ) , −imag(KI(2)\ni ) , ··· , real(KI(n)\ni ) ,\n−imag(KI(n)\ni )]T\n=[real(−KI(1)\ni ·I(1)\niM,q)] (30)\nIreshape[imag(KI(2)\ni ) , real(KI(2)\ni ) , ··· ,\nimag(KI(n)\ni ) , real(KI(n)\ni )]T\n=[imag(−KI(1)\ni ·I(1)\niM,q)] (31)\nwhere, real (·)and imag (·)indicate the real and imaginary\nparts of the concerned variables; KI(1)\ni ·I(1)\niM,q is the calibrated\ncurrent measurements.\nThe propagation process can be conducted on the\nwhole transmission system with a mesh network structure.\nChances are that multiple lines connecting the current bus\nbeing estimated and the currents ﬂowing through them out\nof the bus are known. Under these circumstances, the known\ncurrents can be simply moved to the right-hand side of the\nequations. So that all the unknown correction factors of the\nother lines can be estimated.\nCases are also that there are double parallel lines or even\ntriple parallel lines connecting two buses. There is a large\nprobability that the currents ﬂowing through such multiple\nlines are similar or even the same due to the same material\nand length of the line. The differences among measurements\nare small or close to zero, which severely inﬂuences the esti-\nmation accuracy. For example, if I(2)\niM,q and I(3)\niM,q are the two\ncurrents ﬂowing out of bus i through line 2 and line 3 respec-\ntively and those two lines are two parallel lines connecting bus\ni and bus j, then the true values of those two currents are the\nsame. Without pre-processing, even with constraints on the\ncorrection factors, the least squares optimization results could\npossibly be that KI(2)\ni is around 1 .0526 +j0.1005 and KI(3)\ni\nis around 0 .9452 −j0.1005. The correction factors’ values\nare pushed to the limits and the accurate results are covered.\nFurthermore, part of the contribution of I(3)\niM,q to I(1)\niM,q is\ncounted as I(2)\niM,q’s. The solution to this issue is ﬁnding all the\nmeasurements of parallel lines and sum them together. The\ncorrection factors will also be summed up to one. The estima-\ntion process, in this case, is not aimed to ﬁnd each accurate\ncurrent but to ﬁnd one accurate summation. Theoretically,\nwith the same length, material, and operation environment,\nthe currents ﬂowing through those parallel lines should be the\nsame. Therefore, with the accurate summation divide by the\nnumber of parallel lines, the accurate current ﬂowing through\none line can be reached. With the measurements on other\nlines, the correction factors can be calculated by taking the\nratio of the true value and measurements respectively.\nThe estimation model formed previously can be simply\ntransferred into a typical quadratic optimization problem with\nthe bounded constraints listed in (28).

Provided the knowl-\nedge of these propagated correction factors, the reference\nof the consecutive TL is found and the estimation can be\nperformed.\nC. SYSTEM TOPOLOGY\nBased on the former propagation methods, the accuracy of the\nreference bus can be passed to the consecutive lines through\nthe interconnected topology of the system.\nGiven that transmission systems usually form mesh-\nstructured networks, the Edge-based Breadth-ﬁrst Search\n(EBBFS) algorithm is utilized in this work to construct the\ntree topology with the reference bus as the root. The ﬂow\nchart of this algorithm can be found in Figure 6. Unlike\nthe traditional Breadth-ﬁrst Search algorithm trying to ﬁnd\nnode visiting sequence, the proposed method is more focused\non visiting the edges/lines in the network. The nodes/buses,\non the other hand, can be visited multiple times due to the\nmesh structure to make sure that all the lines in the network\nare visited. Therefore, this EBBFS method is more suitable\nto the line parameter estimation problem under discussion.\nThe typical search process can be seen in Figure 7. The\nnumbers in the small circles indicate the order in which the\nline is evaluated. As can be seen, there are two nodes/buses\nin the network were visited twice to make sure the 11 th and\n12th lines are estimated.\nThe EBBFS can traverse all the concerned TLs in the\nsystem. When one unvisited line is found by the algorithm,\nthe correction factors of the ‘‘From bus’’ of this line are\nguaranteed to have been estimated during the processing of\nthe previous lines. These methods can assure that all the\nconcerned lines are analyzed. At the same time, the breadth-\nﬁrst search keeps the tree’s height as small as possible. So that\nthe accuracy has the slowest decay rate.\nThe ﬂow chart in Figure 8 demonstrates the complete sys-\ntem PS parameters estimation and instrument transformers\ncalibration process.\nFIGURE 6. The edge-based breadth-first search algorithm flowchart.\nFIGURE 7. The edge-based breadth-first search traverse order.\nIV. CASE STUDY\nTwo test cases, the IEEE 118-bus system and Texas\n2000-bus system [26], have been used to validate the pro-\nposed methodology. Synthetic data based on these cases are\ngenerated and used as the input of the estimation procedure.\nThe reporting frame rate of simulated PMU is set to be\n30 frames/second. Hence, the total number of time instances\nfor one hour is 30 ×60 ×60 =108,000. Based on the strat-\negy introduced in Section III. III-A, 1800 time instances\nof power ﬂow are conducted based on the load curve of\none summer day morning-load-pick-up hour data of the\nVOLUME 7, 2019 145111\nC.

The complete process of the line parameter estimation.\nDominion Energy Virginia system. The voltages and currents\nare recorded as the original true values.\nPMU measurements are generalized based on the afore-\nmentioned error model. The three-phase ratio errors are ran-\ndomly generated within the boundary of rM,ph ∈[0.95,1.05]\nand rA,ph ∈[−5◦,5◦]. They will remain constant during the\nwhole estimation process because of the limited time duration\nto be simulated. Although, according to the accuracy classes\nlisted in the IEEE standard [5], the errors are far smaller in\nreality. We use larger values to demonstrate the effectiveness\nand robustness of the method here. The PS ratio errors are\nthus calculated with (4) and recorded as part of the true values\nto be estimated. The simulated three-phase measurements are\ncreated using the accurate three-phase voltages and currents\nobtained as well as the generated three-phase ratio errors. The\nsimulated PS measurements are reached by quantizing these\nprocessed three-phase data. The quantization scale for volt-\nages is 12 V and that for currents is 0.65 A. The simulated data\nis closer to real-world PMU measurement readings according\nto [23] than only using assumed Gaussian distributed syn-\nthetic errors as in [17].\nA. IEEE 118-BUS SYSTEM\n1) SYSTEM AND PMU MEASUREMENTS GENERATION\nThe IEEE 118-bus system diagram can be found in Figure 9.\nThere are two voltage levels in the system: Buses 8, 9, 10,\n26, 30, 38, 63, 64, 65, 68, 81 are 345 KV buses (blue and\nbold buses and lines in the system diagram); The others are\n138 KV buses (black buses and lines). The analysis was con-\nducted on the high-voltage-level (345 KV) buses. Notably,\nthe methodology is also suitable to power systems of other\nvoltage levels.\nBased on this system, PS voltages and currents are acquired\nfor all 345kV buses through AC power ﬂow calculations.\nEven though estimation was only performed on the lines\nTABLE 1. Single transposed line parameters estimation results.\nconnecting the 345kV buses, the currents injections from\nlower voltage levels are also collected due to the data require-\nments of the current accuracy propagation method. All 24\nrelevant lines can be easily identiﬁed through the system\ndiagram.\nWithout losing generality, Bus 81 is chosen as the reference\nbus and the line connecting Bus 81 and Bus 68 as the ﬁrst\nTL to be estimated. This means the synthetic voltage and\ncurrent measurements of Bus 81 on this line are the accurate\nones. For other voltage and current measurements, the PMU\nmeasurement error model derived in Section II. B is deployed\nto simulate the measurements provided by the local PMUs\nwith ratio errors.\nFor transposed lines, it is assumed that the system remains\nthree-phase balanced over the operation time. The single-\nphase power ﬂow results are taken as the Phase A data, and\ndata in the other two phases are generated through ±120◦\nphase angle shifts. One single un-transposed line is taken as\nan example to demonstrate the effectiveness of the estimation\nalgorithm on this circumstance. The three-phase voltages and\ncurrents of the reference bus are generated similarly as the\ntransposed case based on the power ﬂow results. However,\nthose of the other bus are calculated using the provided\nimpedance and susceptance matrices [27].\n2) SINGLE LINE PARAMETERS ESTIMATION RESULTS\nFor transposed lines, the method developed in Section III.\nIII-A is used to estimate the parameters of the line connect-\ning Bus 81 and Bus 68. With accurate voltage and current\nmeasurements known on Bus 81, its correction factors are\nKV1 =KI1 =1 +j0. The correction factors of the voltage\non and the current ﬂowing out of Bus 68, KV2 and KI2 are\nalso estimated for instrument transformers calibration. The\ncomputation results are shown in TABLE 1.\nThe estimation results indicate good accuracy. The respec-\ntive error rates of the correction factors are 7.8956E-06 %\nfor KV2 real part, 7.6117E-02% for KV2 imaginary part,\n6.1495E-03% for KI2 real part, and 1.5740% for KI2 imag-\ninary part. The errors of imaginary parts are larger than\nthat of the corresponding real parts. The main reason is that\nthe absolute values of the imaginary parts of the correction\n145112 VOLUME 7, 2019\nC. Wanget al.: Transmission Lines Positive Sequence Parameters Estimation and Instrument Transformers Calibration\nFIGURE 9. The IEEE 118-bus system diagram.\nfactors are much smaller than the real parts by nature. This\nis brought by the ratio errors angle limits deﬁned by the\nstandards. This numeric characteristic highly inﬂuenced the\nprecision of estimating the imaginary parts. However, based\non the same numeric feature, the accuracy of the line param-\neters estimation is remarkable, which is not interfered by\nthe imaginary parts of the correction factors. The error rate\nof the resistance, reactance, and susceptance estimation are\n6.1517E-02%, 7.1649E-04%, and 6.5191E-02% respectively.\nComparing with the existing methods for single line parame-\nters estimation proposed in [11]–[13], the performance of the\nproposed method is obviously better than their 1% level error\nrates.\nFor the un-transposed line, the impedance matrix and the\nsusceptance matrix used to generate three-phase data are\nas follows (35) and (36), as shown at the bottom of this\npage.\nThe estimation results are listed in TABLE 2. The absolute\nerror rates of the PS three line parameters are all smaller than\n2%. For the most important parameter, the PS line reactance,\nthe error rate is smaller than 0.5%. Even though the over-\nall accuracy of the estimation is lower than the transposed\ncase, it is still satisfactory. These results clearly demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the single TL parameters estimation\nmethod when deployed to both transposed and un-transposed\nTLs.\nTABLE 2. Single un-transposed line parameters estimation results.\nAlthough the error rates of the estimated results are com-\nparatively larger than the results in [27] for un-transposed\nlines, the most important parameter ( X) still has an error\nrate that far smaller than 1%. It is also to be noted that the\nproposed method only requires PS measurements other than\nthe full three-phase data as required in [27] which means the\ninformation input in the estimation process is less in the pro-\nposed method than in [27]. The three-phase transformation\nundoubtedly increases the difﬁculty of the estimation.\n3) SYSTEM LINES PARAMETERS ESTIMATION\nSince the estimation accuracy difference between the trans-\nposed and un-transposed lines is small, the balanced system\ncases are utilized to illustrate the capability of the proposed\nalgorithm for simplicity. Given the effectiveness of the sin-\ngle line parameter estimation algorithm, with the methods\nZabc =\n\n\n8.5922 +61.0128i 4 .1208 +27.6955i 4 .0940 +23.9696i\n4.1208 +27.6955i 8 .5131 +61.0865i 4 .0932 +27.7693i\n4.0940 +23.9696i 4 .0932 +27.7693i 8 .4612 +61.1171i\n\n (35)\nyabc =\n\n\n1.0913E-04i −1.6076E-05i −1.6076E-05i\n−1.6076E-05i 1 .0544E-04i −2.4244E-05i\n−1.6076E-05i −2.4244E-05i 1 .0544E-04i\n\n (36)\nVOLUME 7, 2019 145113\nC. Wanget al.: Transmission Lines Positive Sequence Parameters Estimation and Instrument Transformers Calibration\nTABLE 3. System lines parameters estimation results.\nFIGURE 10. The 345 KV subsystem diagram.\nin Section III. III-B, the estimation process is propagated\ntowards the 345 KV subsystem. The subsystem diagram is\nshown in Figure 10. The numbers in circles indicate bus\nnumbers. Propagation order provided by EBBFS is from left\nto right. The reference bus and line remain the same as in the\nsingle line estimation process case.\nThe estimation results are shown in TABLE 3. It can be\nseen that the estimation is generally accurate. Most of the\nerror rates of the estimated line parameters are smaller than\nor around 1%. However, comparatively notable errors are also\npresent. The error rate of the resistance and susceptance of the\nline between Bus 64 and Bus 63 are 12.8980% and 8.6431%\nrespectively.\nThe possible reasons for this phenomenon include: 1) this\nline is a shorter TL compared with others. The susceptance\nof this line is far smaller than the other lines, which can cause\nnumerical errors within (20). Because the line impedance is\nestimated based on the knowledge of susceptance as shown\nin (21), the error of susceptance estimation can be easily\npassed to the line impedance. 2) this line is comparatively far\nfrom the reference bus. Such distance can result in the accu-\nmulative effect of the ratio errors, due to the propagation pro-\ncesses. Without the propagation of accurate measurements,\nthe estimation process of this line can be easily inﬂuenced.\nOne can also observe around 2% error rates of the estimation\nof the lines connecting Bus 30 with Bus 26, Bus 8 with\nBus 9, and Bus 9 with Bus 10. These larger error rates are\nlikewise brought by the distances from the reference bus. The\ntable is arranged based on the visited order of the lines in\nthe subsystem. A pattern can be summarized indicating the\nincrease of the errors along with the consecutive visits of the\nlines.\nComparing with the existing works, we can ﬁnd that the\nproposed method performs much better. In [17], authors\nclaimed that the general absolute error is within ±0.02 p.u.\nfor line reactance which is larger than the proposed method\nsince the p.u. values for line reactance are generally much\nsmaller than 1. In addition, the assumption raised in [17]\nindicates that the line parameters would not change during\na 24-hour period with more than 60% load variation. This\nfurther weakens the physical and realistic meaning of their\nwork. Reference [19] was using a smaller scale study case\nthan this work. The results also showed error rates around\n1%, which is similar to this work. However, the number of\ntransmission line in their cases limited the test of propagation\nmethod introduced in [19].\nB. TEXAS 2000-BUS SYSTEM\nThe Texas 2000-bus system, available in [26] contains\n2007 buses and 2481 lines with three voltage levels: 13.8KV,\n115KV, and 345KV. The 345KV subsystem is composed\nof 224 buses and interconnected by 335 lines. The volt-\nage and current data were generalized in the same manner\nas described in subsection IV-A. IV-A.1. Only one bus is\n145114 VOLUME 7, 2019\nC. Wanget al.: Transmission Lines Positive Sequence Parameters Estimation and Instrument Transformers Calibration\nFIGURE 11.

Estimation error rate of susceptances in texas 2000-bus\nsystem.\nselected as the reference bus and equipped with accurate\nvoltage and current data.\nThe estimation results using the three-phase balanced data\nare shown in the following ﬁgures. For the reactances esti-\nmation results are shown in Figure 11, most of the lines’\nerror rates are within [ −4%, 2%] and the largest does not\nexceed −7%. For the susceptances, most of the lines’ error\nrates lay in the range of [ −5%, 5%] as shown in Figure 13.\nThis shows that even for the large scale systems with more\nthan 300 TLs to be considered, the proposed method is still\neffective. Besides, there is much potential for estimation\naccuracy improvement with more references included. As a\nmatter of fact, for large scale systems, there are more likely to\nexist multiple tie lines and most of these lines are equipped\nwith revenue CTs and PTs that are suitable to be taken as\nreferences in this method.\nHowever, there do exist several cases where the error rates\nare larger than 10% for susceptances. The comparison of\nsusceptances values is made between the lines with larger\nFIGURE 13. Comparison of the distribution of lines susceptances in Texas\n2000-bus system.\nerror rates and the whole group of the lines. The box plots are\nshown in Figure 12. The left box plot shows the distribution of\nthe susceptances of lines with more than 5% estimation error\nrates. The right one demonstrates the distribution of all the\n335 susceptances within the concerned 345KV subsystem.\nAs one can see in the ﬁgure, the lines with larger estimation\nerrors generally are far smaller than the other lines. This\nconﬁrms the reason described in section IV-A.3 that shorter\nTLs with smaller parameters might inﬂuence the estimation\naccuracy.\nThe possible solution to the comparatively large estimation\nerrors can be obtained by integrating more reference mea-\nsurements into the system. Especially for those short TLs\nthat have signiﬁcantly small parameters, installation of the\nrevenue CTs and PTs will effectively relieve them of the\ncumulative errors propagated from former lines and provide\nmore accurate initial data for estimation. Nonetheless, the\ninstallation will also increase the economic cost.\nAlthough the estimation results of several parameters are\ncomparatively large, most of the error rates are limited to be\nwithin -3% and 3%. This level of accuracy demonstrates that\nthe system lines parameters estimation methodology is effec-\ntive for most cases. At the same time, the adaptiveness of the\nalgorithm is also demonstrated. With proper measurements\nand system topology information, the method is applicable to\nany other power systems.\nV. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, a methodology is proposed to estimate\ntransposed/un-transposed TL PS parameters and calibrate\ninstrument transformers in a power system. The method\nis based on the proposed PMU measurement error model.\nWith the reference bus selected, a novel estimation scheme\nis utilized to deal with the quantization characteristics of\nPMU measurements. The estimated accuracy is then propa-\ngated to the whole system following the network topology\nacquired by the Edge-based Breadth-ﬁrst Search method.\nAn advanced current measurements propagation method\nVOLUME 7, 2019 145115\nC. Wanget al.: Transmission Lines Positive Sequence Parameters Estimation and Instrument Transformers Calibration\nbased on quadratic optimization is introduced in this prop-\nagation process to consider ratio errors boundary and to\novercome the parallel lines’ inﬂuence.\nBoth the single TL and the system lines parameters estima-\ntion methods are veriﬁed through the IEEE 118-bus standard\nsystem. The algorithm is also utilized to larger-scale Texas\n2000-bus system. The results show satisfactory accuracy.\nMost of the estimation errors are around 1%. Very few of\nthem are comparatively large to reach 3% to 4% for the\n118-bus system and more than 10% for the 2000-bus sys-\ntem. The possible reasons are also proposed and analyzed,\nincluding short TLs with exceptional small parameters and\naccuracy decaying with large scale systems. Both reveal the\npotential for further investigation. However, the methodol-\nogy proposed is effective and based entirely on the software\nwhich can save utilities much ﬁeldwork efforts. With this\nmethod, utilities can acquire system status very promptly\nwith low economic and time cost. The line parameters and\ntransducers’ correction factors estimated can be used for\nfurther grid applications in wider areas. Extension to other\nsystems is also straightforward with sufﬁcient PMU mea-\nsurements and system topology information. Given the PS\ndata acquisition reality during common utility operation, this\nmethod can satisfy most utilities’ requirements and therefore\ncan be widely deployed. As of the completion of this research\narticle, relevant open-source application (available at [28])\nhas been developed based on the openECA platform (PMU\ndata concentrator) provided by the Grid Protection Alliance.\nREFERENCES\n[1] F.
