Hunt3\nThe emergence of flexible tool use is rare in the animal kingdom and thought to be largely constrained \nby either cognitive ability or ecological factors. That mostly birds with a high level of intelligence \ninnovate tool use in captivity is consistent with the former hypothesis. We report here the first \ndocumented case of habitual tool use innovated in the wild by a bird species only known to have \nused tools in captivity. Trap-boxes containing food-bait and snap-trap(s) were installed in the remote \nMurchison Mountains, New Zealand, from 2002 to catch introduced stoats. Kea tampered with the \ntrap-boxes in various ways. Over approximately 2.5 years, sticks were found inserted into at least 227 \ndifferent trap-boxes that were up to 27 km apart. Video footage confirmed that the stick insertion \nwas kea tool use. Trap-boxes are unlikely to have provided the only possibility for kea tool use in their \nhabitat given their extractive foraging and skilled object manipulation. We argue that they instead \ngreatly facilitated the opportunity for tool use, thus increasing the chance that kea would invent the \nbehaviour. The innovation of tool use by kea in response to facilitation provides rare field support for the \ncognitive constraints hypothesis.\nThe question of why flexible tool use is rare in the animal kingdom is important given the evolutionary signifi -\ncance of the behaviour in human evolution. The emergence, or invention, of tool use in the wild depends on both \necological and cognitive factors. Two, not necessarily mutually exclusive, ecological drivers are necessity and \nopportunity\n1,2. When applied to foraging, ‘necessity’ , when energetic costs are taken into account3, promotes tool \nuse when food obtained without tools is in short supply, and ‘opportunity’ is provided by food that can only be \nobtained with tools, or is more easily obtained with tools. Once tool use is initiated, it is suggested to come under \ngenetic selection only if it is ‘profitable’ , that is, when extractive foraging is on average more energetically profita-\nble when using tools compared to not using tools\n4. All three factors may be involved in initiating and maintaining \ntool use in some chimpanzee Pan troglodytes populations3, but necessity may not be as important as opportunity \nand profitability across tool-using primate populations2,5.\nHypotheses for testing the association between cognition and the innovation of tool use have received less \nattention. Hunt et al.6 argued that there is ample ecological opportunity for tool use to evolve and proposed that \nthe crucial constraint for its rarity across the animal kingdom is a cognitive one. The authors suggested that the \ninnovation of tool use depends on a ‘cognitive leap’ , that is, a mental comprehension that an object can be used \nas a tool to achieve an outcome. They also proposed that this mental understanding is more likely to come about \nthrough rapid learning while interacting with the problem at hand rather than through sophisticated cognition \nsuch as insight. The innovation of tool use will necessarily be associated with one or more underlying ecological \nfactors that provide the potential for the behaviour\n7. Along with the mental comprehension of the utility of a tool, \nan individual also must manipulate the tool effectively to obtain a successful outcome, then repeat the process to \nmaintain the behaviour.\nA prediction of the cognitive-constraints hypothesis is that tool use should more likely emerge in species that \nhave a high level of physical cognition and object manipulation skills, especially when the opportunity for the \nbehaviour is facilitated compared to natural conditions. Captive conditions can provide such facilitation given \nthat non-tool-using species have developed tool use in captivity\n8,9. Examples where the potential opportunity \nfor tool use is facilitated compared to opportunities in the wild would be nutrients or food in plain view that \ncan only be obtained with a tool or personal hygiene issues exacerbated by captive conditions that only a tool \ncan effectively alleviate\n9–11. Captive conditions may also aid the innovation of novel behaviour through (i) food \nprovisioning and the absence of predation, which allows increased free time and energy, and (ii) modelling, \nintended or unintended, of human actions\n12.

The prominence of these two avian groups (ca. 5% of avian species) with their impressive \ncognitive and object manipulation skills 13–15 is consistent with the above prediction. Under the ecological con-\nstraints hypothesis, species innovating tool use in captivity should represent a wide range of cognitive capabilities. \nHowever, there may be a strong bias towards psittacines and corvids innovating tool use in captivity compared \nto other avian species. As psittacines are commonly kept as pets and often interact with people (e.g. vocally), \nthey are likely to be observed relatively more than other bird species. They are also probably more likely to be \nprovided with objects such as sticks and containers for enrichment. Furthermore, researchers investigating avian \ncognitive abilities target psittacines and corvids for field and laboratory study. To our knowledge, there are no \nreports of non-tool-using birds, or other nonhuman animals, innovating habitual tool use in the wild in response \nto facilitation.\nParrots and cockatoos (Psittaciformes) are large-brained birds, and a sister group of passerines also with rela-\ntively large brains\n16. They have highly developed exploratory behaviour and their bill anatomy enables dexterous \nobject manipulation 13,14,17. Unlike most birds, psittacines can move their lower and upper bills independently \nfrom each other. However, there are surprisingly few reports of tool use by free-living psittacines. Notable cases \nare the use of foot-held sticks in drumming behaviour by black palm cockatoos (Probosciger aterrimus)\n18 and the \nuse of wedges by several macaw species to secure hard nuts or fruit stones in the bill while they are broken (e.g. \nhyacinth macaws, Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus)\n19. Tool use in captivity demonstrates that at least some psittacines \nhave the cognitive ability to innovate both the making and the use of tools10,11,20.\nThe kea (Nestor notabilis) is endemic to the South Island of New Zealand and the world’s only alpine parrot21. \nKea are skilful at object manipulation, both in captivity and the wild21,22. Juvenile kea have a strong predisposition \nto combine objects in explorative play22, behaviour thought to be crucial for tool-use acquisition in children and \nbirds23,24. They have used compact tools (e.g. wooden balls) and innovated stick tool use in captivity 21,25,26, but \nwere not known to use tools in the wild. Kea propensity for explorative manipulation of objects may be related to \nCommon name Scientific name Reference No. Psittacine/corvid?\nWedge-tailed eagle Aqulia audax 8 no\nNorthwestern crow Corvus caurinus 8 yes\nEclectus parrot Eclectus roratus 8 yes\nY ellow-crowned parakeet Cyanoramphus auriceps 8 yes\nEurasian oyster catcher Haematopus ostralegus 8 no\nBlue-fronted Amazon parrot Amazona aestiva 8 yes\nY ellow-crowned parrot Amazona ochrocephala 9 yes\nMoluccan cockatoo Cacatua moluccensis 9 yes\nBare-eyed cockatoo Cacatua sanguinea 9 yes\nLesser sulphur-crested cockatoo Cacatua sulphurea 9 yes\nSandhill crane Grus canadensis 9 no\nBald eagle Haliaeetus leucocephalus 9 no\nKea Nestor notabilis 9 yes\nAfrican grey parrot Psittacus erithacus 9 yes\nStriped owl Rhinoptynx clamator 9 no\nRook Corvus frugilegus 9 yes\nBlue jay Cyanocitta cristata 9 yes\nMarsh tit Parus palustris 9 no\nGoffin’s cockatoo Cacatua goffiniana 10 yes\nGreater vasa parrot Coracopsis vasa 11 yes\nEurasian jay Garrulus glandarius 54 yes\nTable 1. Bird species that have used tools in captivity but were not known to be tool users in the wild. Species \nare included if the behaviour meets two recent definitions of tool use8,13. However, we exclude ‘anting’ behaviour \nas it is relatively common in certain passerine groups and species observed anting only in captivity probably \nalso practise the behaviour in the wild. We also exclude the endangered Hawaiian crow Corvus hawaiiensis \nbecause evidence suggests it used tools in the wild for extractive foraging\n55. Captive-bred Hawaiian crows were \nrecently released into the wild at Pu’u Maka’ala Natural Area Reserve on the Island of Hawai’i, which may help \nto confirm whether the species uses tools under present day ecological conditions. The kea is included because \nthe tool use that we document in the wild was innovated after individuals used tools in captivity. The table \nis unlikely to provide an exhaustive list of species, but clearly demonstrates the relatively high frequency of \npsittacines and corvids among the non-tool-using species reported to have used tools in captivity.\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n3\nSCieNtifiC  RepoRTs  |  (2018) 8:13935  | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-32363-9\nthe challenges of finding food in a harsh alpine environment21. Kea are extreme foraging generalists and mainly \neat fruit/seeds, nectar, leaves/leaf buds and invertebrates21,27–29. They practice extractive foraging in soil and veg-\netation using their bill21. In one study, over half the invertebrates kea fed on they extracted from dead wood using \ntheir strong, curved bills28. Therefore, it seems valid to suggest that in certain foraging situations tool use by kea \nmight be more effective than bill use for prey extraction. Even if fine tool manipulation with a strongly curved \nupper bill may be challenging for kea, they are able to direct the working end of a stick tool in a functional way30.\nThus kea should be a species with a high chance of innovating tool use in the wild.\nThe Department of Conservation (DOC) has carried out intensive stoat (Mustela erminea ) trapping opera-\ntions in the south-west corner of the South Island since the early 2000s 31,32. This successful trapping operation \ninvolved installing stoat traps on the ground at high density along trap lines in several regions. The basic early \ntrap-box design consisted of a wooden housing with an entrance at either end in mesh or between wire strands \nto let stoats in but keep large birds like kea out. Snap-traps and bait (eggs and/or meat) were inside the protective \nhousing (Fig.  1). Tampering with the trap-boxes by kea became a problem. For example, they would tip over \ntrap-boxes that were both secured to the ground with steel pegs and unsecured\n33,34. DOC staff in the remote \nMurchison Mountains Special Area also started finding sticks poked into the ends of the trap-boxes that had set \noff snap-traps inside\n34–36 (T.H., personal observation). Stoat trapping was undertaken here from 2002 to protect \nthe endangered ground-nesting takahe (Porphyrio hochstetteri)32,33 (Fig. 2). Many kea also live in this protected \nregion in sub-alpine and alpine habitat. Kea were suspected of inserting the sticks into trap-boxes to try and \naccess the bait, but there was initially no direct evidence to suggest that this was the case.\nA kea habitually using sticks to probe into stoat traps in the Murchison Mountains was eventually captured on \nfilm by one of us (M.G.) using motion-activated trail cameras\n37. As far as we know, this is the only direct evidence \nto date that kea are responsible for inserting sticks into trap-boxes. Here we detail the kea’s probing behaviour and \nshow that it is clearly tool use. Furthermore, the trapping operation provided an unplanned field experiment that \nallowed us to document the development of tool behaviour in a free-living kea population. Our findings are the \nFigure 1. Examples of stoat traps described in the paper.

The lids on all the trap-boxes have been opened to allow inspection of the contents.\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n4\nSCieNtifiC  RepoRTs  |  (2018) 8:13935  | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-32363-9\nfirst scientific documentation of a nonhuman animal using tools in New Zealand. They also have implications for \nexplaining why flexible tool use in the wild rarely emerges in the animal kingdom.\nResults\nDevelopment and extent of trap-box tampering by kea. The 720 trap-boxes installed in the \nMurchison Mountains in 2002 were only systematically staked to the ground after 2007. Field workers inspect-\ning the 720 trap-boxes before 2008 routinely found them tipped over and kea were thought to be responsible \nfor much of this disturbance\n33. However, there is no recollection of sticks being inserted into trap-boxes before \n2008 (Danilo Hegg, personal communication). Insertion of objects into the entrances of trap-boxes was noticed \nfrom 2008. The objects were not sticks but human-associated items left close to trap-boxes (batteries, wrappers \nand plastic tags) and stones\n28 (T.H., personal observation). Inspection staff suggested that in some cases the \nstones had been transported some distance to the trap-boxes as they could find none locally 36. One of us (T.H.) \nfirst noticed the insertion of sticks into trap-boxes at the study site in 2010 (T.H. has been inspecting trap-boxes \nthere for DOC from 2008 to the present day). A DOC report for the Takahe Programme for the period 1 July \n2009 to 30 June 2010 notes that stick insertion was a significant problem, with up to 70% of snap-traps sprung in \nsome areas\n36. Thus stick insertion by kea probably began in late 2009 or early 2010. Trap-box inspection records \nbetween November 2010 and June 2012, and in 2014, recorded sticks inserted into 113 different trap-boxes in \nlate 2010, six in 2011, 81 in the first half of 2012, and 50 in 2014 (Table 2; Fig. 3A–D). The total of 250 stick inser-\ntion records across just over 2.5 years thus represent 227 different trap-boxes. The 227 trap-boxes were spread \nthroughout the study area; the greatest distance between any two was ca. 27 km, and they were particularly widely \ndispersed in 2012 (Fig. 3C). Unbaited run-through trap-boxes were targeted for stick insertion in 2014 soon after \ntheir installation (Fig.  3D); 27 of the 50 different trap-boxes recorded with sticks inserted were this type. Stick \ninsertion was effective at setting off snap-traps in trap-boxes as the proportion that were sprung when trap-boxes \nwere inspected was generally much greater in those with sticks inserted (Table 2).\nIn an effort to prevent stick insertion, smaller-sized stainless steel mesh was used to replace larger-sized gal-\nvanised mesh on the ends of some single-set trap-boxes. However, kea still succeeded in setting off the snap-traps \nand accessing the egg bait. They did this by removing one or two strands of stainless steel from the edge of the cut \nmesh and inserted it through the mesh to push the egg into the snap-trap. When the snap-trap was set off it broke \nthe egg and kea were able to feed on the egg contents that leaked from the trap-box. This use of stainless steel \nstrands was not observed directly, but the strands were found inserted into multiple trap-boxes (Martin Genet, \npersonal communication; T.H., personal observation). As a consequence, the stainless steel mesh was replaced \nwith stainless steel plate. In the areas in 2010–2011 where trap-boxes were only baited with meat to try and reduce \nkea tampering, kea interference was virtually eliminated, but remained high in areas where egg bait was used\n38.\nKea have also been innovative at tampering with trap-boxes without using sticks or wire. After trap-boxes \nwere secured to the ground with steel or wooden pegs, trap-boxes were still tipped over. Kea did this by first dig-\nging around the securing pegs until they were loose enough in the ground to allow the trap-box to be tipped over. \nThe birds also removed the lids of trap-boxes by initially removing screws securing the lids that had become loose \nover time. This allowed them to access the trap-box contents, which sometimes resulted in kea deaths\n39. After \nloose screws were secured kea then excavated wood around screws to remove lids. Stick insertion into trap-boxes \nand other tampering was still occurring in 2017 (M.G., personal observation). However, the latest trap-box design \n(i.e. with side entrances, stainless steel plate on each end, internal galvanised mesh or wooden baffles and steel \nbrackets to protect longer screws securing the lid) has almost eliminated the deactivation of snap-traps by kea \n(T.H., personal observation).\nFigure 2.

For example, they \nhave used their bills to neatly cut holes in the fine mesh covering the ends of trap-boxes on Resolution Island, ca. \n90 km away and just off the coast of Fiordland (Fig. 2), after their installation in 2008. This allowed them to get the \negg bait inside (Peter McMurtrie & Sanjay Thakur, personal communications). Although there was both egg and \nmeat bait side by side, the kea usually only took the egg bait. However, stick insertion has only been noticed in \none trap-box on the island in over 10 years even though all trap-boxes there had end entrances (Peter McMurtrie, \npersonal communication). There are unconfirmed report of sticks inserted into trap-boxes installed on the main-\nland relatively close to the Murchison Mountains, ca. 120 km away in the West Matukituki Valley in the summer \nof 2011/2012\n35.

The behaviour was rare \nat first then rapidly increased in frequency before the trap-boxes were secured to the ground.\nTrail camera footage of kea behaviour at trap-boxes. The trail cameras captured a total of 39 kea ses-\nsions at the three trap-boxes (Table 3). Except for one of the 17 sessions at TM20 when two kea were present, only \none (unmarked) kea was present in a session. We assume here that all single-kea sessions at TM20 involved the \nsame individual, and that only one individual visited adjacent LC01 and LC02. Once arriving at a trap-box, kea \nalmost always spent their time interacting with it in a way that indicated they were interested in its contents (i.e. \nfood if present and one or two snap-traps). This interaction occurred in three main ways. First, the kea at LC02 \nspent 69.9% of the time close to a side entrance involved in behaviour associated with probing into the entrance \nwith sticks or putting its head into the entrance (observed 4 times at LC01 and 6 times at LC02). At LC01, the kea \nspent a small amount of time (10%) at a side entrance involved in probing behaviour as it only made one probing \nattempt. The kea was involved in probing behaviour in 12 of the 14 sessions at LC02. In 11 of these 12 sessions the \nprobing was at the side entrance on the opposite side of the trap-box to where the camera was positioned (Fig. 4B, \nSupplementary Video S1). This meant it was not possible to directly observe all details of how sticks were manip-\nulated in relation to that entrance. In the remaining session, the kea probed at the side entrance in direct view of \nthe camera (Fig. 4A, Supplementary Videos S2 & S3). This confirmed that it deliberately inserted sticks into the \nside entrance. At LC01 (n = 1) and LC02 (n = 66), we recorded 67 cases of kea inserting, or attempting to insert, \na stick into a side entrance. Interestingly, we never observed the kea attempting to insert a stick through the mesh \nbarrier on the ends of LC01 and LC02.\nSecond, kea at TM20 spent 62.9% of the time close to either end of the trap-box where they could potentially \nsee the contents through the mesh (Table 3). They either stood in front of the mesh or looked into the mesh while \nstanding on the lid of the trap-box. The entrances into TM20, unlike the side entrances on LC01 and LC02, were \nholes in the bottom of the mesh. No kea put their head into the entrance or tried to insert a stick into it. The kea \nvisiting LC01 and LC02 spent a relatively limited amount of time in front of the ends of the trap-boxes (10% & \n4.2%, respectively) (Table 3).\nLast, at some stage in 28 of the 39 sessions at all three trap-boxes a kea made an apparent attempt to break into \nthe housing. This involved using the bill to usually grasp, or bite, an edge of the wooden housing and apply some \nforce in a levering action (Fig. 4C, Supplementary Video S4). This grasping sometimes occurred after looking into \nthe trap-box or probing into it with a stick.\nThe period between the first and last recording of the kea using sticks to probe into LC02 was 51 days (probing \nhappened on 10 of those 51 days; Table 3). The kea mostly obtained sticks within ca. 0.5 m of the side entrance in \nwhich they were used as probes. Sometimes it moved out of view of the camera and returned within a few seconds \nwith a new stick. There was no footage of the kea carrying a stick when arriving at a trap-box. The kea was often \nvery active when probing, moving the non-working end around a lot or removing and re-inserting the stick. The \nbird showed considerable persistence, with the longest probing session lasting 45 min. The persistent probing \nis reflected in the longer mean session times at LC02 compared to those times at TM20 and LC01 (Table  3). \nHowever, we never saw a kea obtain any food from LC02. There was only one observation of the kea setting off  \na snap-trap in LC02 while probing with a stick (Supplementary Video S1). When the snap-trap went off the kea \nimmediately withdrew its stick and looked into the mesh end of the trap-box, presumably to inspect the contents. \nIt continued probing with sticks for about eight minutes after the snap-trap was deactivated. The kea once left  \nthe side entrance it was probing in, went quickly over the trap-box to put its head in the other side entrance, then \nquickly back again to probe in the original entrance. This rapid movement between side entrances also indicated \nthat the kea was focused on the trap-box’s contents.\nThere were four cases of the kea throwing away the stick it was probing with and then selecting another stick \nto use. The kea also sometimes withdrew the stick it was probing with, flipped it around then used it to probe \nagain, but it was unclear if the flipping was intentional. The kea also used its bill to modify probing sticks, either by \nshortening/removing side extensions (in 3 sessions) (Supplementary Video S2) or removing material from larger \ndiameter sticks (in 4 sessions) (Supplementary Video S5).\nKea play extensively with objects\n21. In the last five sessions at LC02, the kea appeared to play with sticks in \nan obvious way. These five sessions occurred over the 17 days at the end of the 51 day period when the kea was \nfilmed probing with sticks. The play was distinctly different to the kea’s use of sticks to probe into the trap-box \nas it occurred away from a side entrance. The play sometimes involved the kea throwing a stick with its bill \nthen picking it up again, carrying it away from the trap-box or manipulating a stick while lying on the ground \nTrap-box\nLength of video capture \nperiod (days)/No. of \nactual days kea filmed\nNo. of sessions \nat a trap-box \nby kea\nMean session \nduration \n(min ± s.d.)\nTime kea were \nclose to trap-\nbox (min)\nTime kea were at \neither end of trap-\nbox (min)\nTime kea spent \nmanipulating sticks \nat side entry (min)\nNo. of stick insertions/\nattempted insertions into \ntrap-box entry\nTM20 45/10 17 5.5 ± 7.2 26.7 16.8 n/a 0\nLC01 28/8 8 3.4 ± 2.7 5.0 0.5 0.5 1\nLC02 51/13 14 12.1 ± 12.0 76.3 3.2 53.3 66\nTable 3.

The entries to TM20 \nwere in the mesh on the ends of the trap-box, but the entries to LC01 and LC02 were on the sides of the trap-\nboxes. 47 clips with kea activity were taken at TM20, 14 clips at LC01 and 99 at LC02. All clips at LC01 and LC02 \nwere 60 s long, but 21 of the 47 clips at TM20 were shorter than 60 s because of recording problems.\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n7\nSCieNtifiC  RepoRTs  |  (2018) 8:13935  | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-32363-9\n(Supplementary Videos S4 & S6). The kea also threw sticks away after probing with them, but these cases appeared \nto be related to frustration from a lack of probing success. The kea at LC01 also appeared to play with a triangu-\nlar white-plastic marking tag that it had found, on three occasions carrying it from the ground to the top of the \ntrap-box.\nDiscussion\nThe main reason why kea tampered with baited trap-boxes was to access the egg bait, both inside and outside \nour study area. Our video footage demonstrated that the repeated stick insertion and probing by the kea at LC02 \nwas purposeful to interact with out-of-reach trap-box contents. Also, the kea at TM20 was intent on looking into \nthe trap-box. Kea are known to persist at exploratory play with an object\n21, but the obvious play at LC02 did not \ninvolve stick insertion, or probing, into the side entrances. Thus the kea’s stick probing at LC02 was purpose-\nful and clearly tool use\n8,40. The tool use has important implications for the unobserved insertion of objects (i.e. \nsticks and wire) into trap-boxes both inside and outside the Murchison Mountains study area. Kea also probed \ninto unbaited run-through traps-boxes in 2014 (Fig.  1A). This is curious given that they seemed to have previ-\nously ignored trap-boxes without egg bait several years earlier. Thus kea might have probed into run-through \ntrap-boxes that they probably knew were unbaited because the effect of setting off snap-traps was intrinsically \nrewarding. They may have done so as the snap-traps were relatively easy to reach with sticks through entrances \non the ends of these trap-boxes. Further work is needed to determine if kea used tools to simply deactivate \nsnap-traps.\nKea stick tool use described here appears to have been innovated in response to the introduction of trap-boxes. \nFirst, tool use by free-living kea was previously unknown in spite of considerable research on their behaviour in \nthe wild\n21. This is supported by the lack of stick insertion into trap-boxes over many years on Resolution Island \nand at other sites in and close to Fiordland. Second, the first sticks inserted into trap-boxes were only noticed in \nthe study area well after the initial introduction of (baited) trap-boxes in 2002. If the kea were already proficient \nat using stick tools, we would have expected to find sticks commonly inserted into trap-boxes soon after their \ninitial installation in 2002 given the kea’s extractive foraging skills and curiosity about human-associated objects. \nHowever, as Fig. 3 shows, sticks were recorded inserted into relatively few trap-boxes in the south east region \nwhere traps were restricted to from 2002–2007. The original trap-boxes in this region were not modified with side \nentrances until after 2012 (Supplementary Table S1). Last, the first items noticed inserted into trap-boxes were not \nFigure 4. Frames from the Supplementary video footage showing the kea tampering with trap-box LC02. (A) \nThe kea probing with a stick in the visible side entrance (Video S1). The lighter-coloured wood on the ends of \nthe trap-box are modifications to move the entrances from the ends to the sides of the unit to try and prevent \nkea setting off snap-traps inside.

Given anecdotal reports of \nsick insertion into trap-boxes 120 km distant from the study area, tool use by kea to access trap-box contents may \nhave developed independently more than once.\nLarge variation across years existed in the number of different trap-boxes in the study area that were recorded \nwith sticks inserted. For example, the low number in 2011 contrasts with the much higher numbers in November \n2010 and January-June 2012. Some of the variation was due to missing data when staff inspecting trap-boxes \ndid not record stick insertion. Variation may also be associated with the series of modifications to the design \nof trap-boxes to try and prevent kea tampering (Supplementary Table S1). The initial outbreak of stick inser -\ntion in 2009/2010 was quickly followed by the fitting of wooden baffles to the side entrances of trap-boxes out-\nside the south-east region. The baffles likely reduced stick insertion in 2011 before it seems to have increased in \nJanuary-June 2012. Modifications to trap-boxes such as fitting side entrances also reduced the frequency of kea \nstick insertion, especially just after their introduction (T.H., personal observation). The widespread tampering \nwith trap-boxes at several Fiordland locations that did not involve sticks (e.g. tipping over trap-boxes, opening \ntrap-box lids) was carried out by many kea. Similarly, the widespread stick insertion across our study area sug-\ngests that more than one kea were inserting sticks into trap-boxes. Data on kea movements show that individual \nkea could potentially forage throughout much of the Murchison Mountains. Daily activity patterns of two banded \nkea at Mt Cook National Park included flights of 10–20 km\n29. Studies41,42 in the central and upper South Island \nalso found that banded kea were usually resighted 10–20 km from their banding location. Juveniles, though, \nprobably disperse from their natal range when independent 42. Nevertheless, the extent, geographic spread and \npersistence of stick insertion into trap-boxes over many years makes it more likely that multiple kea were habitu-\nally carrying out this behaviour.\nAt first glance, our findings might be viewed as support for the predominant role of ecological conditions \nin initiating tool use. For example, there was no ecological opportunity for kea to use probing tools before the \ntrap-boxes were installed. The trap-boxes provided that opportunity and tool use was invented. Similarly, food \nsupplies could have been unusually scarce around the time kea began inserting sticks into trap-boxes, thus neces-\nsity together with opportunity might have initiated tool use. Few data exist on how kea food supplies varied \nin the study area. However, many plants in New Zealand forests, including the extensive beech forests (family \nNothofagaceae) in the Murchison Mountains\n32 (kea are known to occasionally eat beech seed 29), are masting \nspecies and do not produce an abundance of sound seed every year 43. Therefore, beech mast years in our study \narea may provide some indication of weather-related variation in a range of food resources for the birds. There \nwere four mast years between 2000 and 2015: in 2006/2007, 2009/2010, 2011/2012 and 2014/2015 (Sanjay Thakur, \npersonal communication). This means there were at least four non-mast years after trap-boxes were first installed \nin 2002 before kea began to probe into trap-boxes with sticks. Thus the initial appearance of kea tool use around \n2009/2010 does not appear to be closely associated with extremely low food resources in their habitat (necessity \nhypothesis).\nCognitive constraints may better explain why kea did not appear to have invented tool use when foraging at \nour study site before the introduction of trap-boxes. Our discussion below focuses on cognitive constraints and \nthe invention of tool use at the individual level and not on evolutionary explanations. First, Kea practice extrac-\ntive foraging and are highly motivated to interact with potential probe sites. In captivity they are much more \ninterested in a cube with a slot that can be probed with the bill or looked into than one without a slot\n21. In their \nsub-alpine forest habitat, there should be potential probe sites with cached food (e.g. invertebrates, lizards) where \nit would be more efficient to employ tool use. Although it has a bill specifically evolved for fine tool manipula-\ntion\n44,45, the New Caledonian crow uses tools extensively to extract prey cached in forest habitat from near sea \nlevel to over 1,600 m above sea level46,47. Thus it is highly likely that opportunities exist for kea to invent tool use to \nextract prey from natural probe sites. Furthermore, the probing by New Caledonian crows is often more investiga-\ntive and does not appear to require precision manipulation of the end of the tool (G.R.H., personal observation). \nWe have shown here that kea have the manipulation skills to carry out this kind of tool use. Bills of female kea \nare 13% shorter than those of males\n48, thus tool use by females in particular may be advantageous for obtaining \nout-of-reach prey. Second, the design of the initial trap-boxes facilitated the opportunity for innovating tool use \ncompared to the characteristics of natural holes and crevices. The trap-boxes made it relatively easy for a bird with \nhigh object manipulation skills to get a successful outcome by inserting a stick (i.e. access to food). Trap-boxes \nwith end entrances in wide mesh, in particular, enabled kea to easily insert sticks of a range of sizes while having \na clear view of the ‘cached’ contents (i.e. food and snap-trap) and stick movement. In contrast, potential prey \ncached in natural probe sites are unlikely to be in full view of kea. Side entrances where kea could not see trap-box \ncontents while probing were probably more realistic of natural probe sites. However, probing into side entrances \nlikely occurred after previous experience of probing into the ends of trap-boxes. The trap-boxes were also at high \ndensity, visually obvious and regularly baited over many years, which provided the opportunity for kea to repeat \nand maintain the tool use. Third, the lack of tool use by kea to probe into trap-boxes outside the study area is \ninconsistent with the ecological opportunity hypothesis. Kea probing into trap-boxes with sticks across several \nyears in the Murchison Mountains suggests that tool use was often advantageous for obtaining egg bait. Their \nbehaviour at other locations, such as biting through mesh to extract egg bait and tipping over trap-boxes, demon-\nstrates that the kea were well motivated to interact with trap-box contents. Thus those trap-boxes clearly provided \nan opportunity for kea tool use but evidence of the behaviour only consists of anecdotal reports.\nTo recall, natural probe sites likely exist for kea where tool use to extract prey would be more efficient than \nbill use, even if they were uncommon. The trap-boxes at our study site greatly facilitated tool use, but even so the \nbehaviour did not emerge until many years after their installation. This reinforces our contention that innovating \ntool use at natural probe sites is cognitively demanding. Confirmation that the trap-boxes facilitated the innova-\ntion of kea tool use as opposed to providing a unique opportunity for the behaviour would be if kea transferred \nthe tool use to natural probe sites when extractive foraging. Therefore, follow up work on natural foraging by kea \nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n9\nSCieNtifiC  RepoRTs  |  (2018) 8:13935  | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-32363-9\nin the Murchison Mountains could provide important insight into why tool use is rare in animals. That tool use \nemerged at our study site but has been rarely reported at other trapping locations suggested that some kea have \na level of domain-general intelligence for inventing tool use while others do not, which also implicates cogni-\ntive constraints. Under the profitability hypothesis\n4, when tool use is more efficient, on average, than bill use it \nwill evolve to become population-level behaviour. For example, a genetic basis for tool use is evident in several \ntool-using bird species, including the New Caledonian crow\n4,44, but there are currently few data to suggest that \ntool use is under selection in nonhuman mammals49. Our findings raise the distinct possibility that tool use could \npersist as occasional behaviour in certain species without coming under selection. Under this scenario, kea with \nthe domain-general intelligence to invent or socially acquire the behaviour would use tools at those less com-\nmon probe sites where bill use was ineffective. That only some kea appear to have this level of domain-general \nintelligence even when the opportunity for tool use is greatly facilitated, combined with the increased cognitive \nchallenges of inventing tool use at natural probe sites, would place substantial cognitive constraints on tool use \nemerging in the course of natural foraging.\nField experiments with honey extraction also implicate cognitive constraints as the main reason for the lack \nof stick tool use by some primate populations who only use other types of tools. The Sonso population of chim-\npanzees in Uganda that use leaf tools but not stick tools failed to use sticks to extract honey in prepared holes\n50,51. \nIn a similar experiment, the Pedra Furada group of bearded capuchin monkeys (Sapajus libidinosus ) in Brazil \nwho use stone tools but not stick tools also failed to use sticks to extract honey from holes52. When the degree of \nfacilitation was increased by leaving sticks in the holes for individuals to pull out and use as tools, individuals from \nboth populations still failed to use the sticks as tools\n51,52. Gruber and colleagues3,50,51 have suggested that conserv-\natism or cultural bias for existing, non-stick-tool behaviour and/or ‘functional fixedness’ (failure to use familiar \nobjects in novel ways) may have prevented stick tool innovation in Sonso chimpanzees. Similar work with captive, \nnon-tool-using macques (Macaca fascicularis fascicularis) failed to elicit stone-hammering tool use to access nut \ncontents in 31 motivated individuals\n53. This was in spite of increasing levels of facilitation that culminated in a full \ntool use demonstration by their human keeper. Further research is needed to identify the cognitive constraints \nthat can prevent experienced tool-users inventing novel tool use. Nevertheless, the above examples lend support \nto the view\n6 that cognitive constraints rather than associated ecological conditions are the crucial factor limiting \nthe innovation of flexible tool use in nonhuman animals. Our study was similar to the capuchin and chimpanzee \nfield experiments as kea could also decide on their own whether or not to participate, but it was an unplanned one. \nUnlike the primate experiments above, the degree of facilitation for tool use was not increased for kea. On the con-\ntrary, it was mostly reduced in response to kea success at inserting sticks into trap-boxes and setting off snap-traps.\nIn summary, we provide the first evidence that a non-tool-using bird species with a high level of physical cog-\nnition innovated habitual tool use in the wild in response to facilitation. This finding is consistent with a predic-\ntion of the cognitive constraints hypothesis explaining why flexible tool use is rare. That is, birds with a high level \nof intelligence and physical cognition, like the kea, should more readily innovate tool use when it is facilitated. We \nsuggest an experimental paradigm to test this prediction, where non-tool-using species that differ in cognitive \nability would be required to innovate tool use that is facilitated to varying degrees. The expectation would be \nthat the level of physical cognition and object manipulation skills will be negatively correlated with the degree \nof facilitation needed for tool use to emerge. Furthermore, our findings indicate that even with a high degree of \nfacilitation the invention of tool use in the wild for species like the kea with considerable domain-general intelli-\ngence is cognitively demanding.\nMethods\nTrapping regime. The study site was the 510 km2 Murchison Mountains Special Area of the Fiordland \nNational Park (Fig. 2). Access to the public is severely restricted, being limited to the McKenzie Burn Valley and \nWoodrow Burn in the far west of the study area and only for a short period each year. Thus only research and \nconservation personnel visit the majority of the study area. Trap lines were installed on the peninsular from 200 m \na.s.l. on the edge of Lake Te Anau to over 1,500 m a.s.l. From 2002 to 2007, 720 trap-boxes were installed in the \nsouth-east sector of the study site over an area of ca. 150 square km32,33 (see Fig. 3). This number was increased \nto 1745 trap-boxes in the summer of 2008/2009 throughout most of the 510 km2 study site32. Between 2013 and \n2015, the number of trap-boxes was increased to 3400 by adding new trap lines and infilling existing trap lines so \ntrap-boxes were 100 m apart rather than 200 m apart32. The infilling took place from 300 m a.s.l. to the bush line. \nTwenty-two new trap lines were added and an existing one was extended (Fig. 3D). We plotted the GPS locations \nof trap-boxes onto a 1:25,000 contour map using the software Memory-Map Version 6.\nThe trapping system used from 2002 to 2007 was a double-set trap-box, consisting of bait placed between \ntwo Fenn Mark 4 snap-traps (see Fig.  1B–D where DOC 150 snap-traps are used instead of the Fenn Mark 4 \nsnap-traps). The Fenn snap-traps were replaced with DOC 150 snap-traps in 2007/2008. Fenn snap-traps close \nupwards, in contrast to the DOC 150 snap-traps which close downwards. It is possible that an inserted stick was \nmore likely to set off, and get caught in, a DOC 150 snap-trap than a Fenn Mark 4 trap (T.H., personal observa-\ntion). Trap-boxes installed after 2007 were mostly double-set containing two DOC 150 snap-traps. Some baited \nsingle-set trap-boxes were installed in 2008/2009 in alpine areas above the bush line that contained a single DOC \n150 snap-trap. These trap-boxes had a side entrance at only one end of the unit. That is, there was only one \nsnap-trap and the egg bait was between the snap-trap and the end without an entrance. The original 13 mm galva-\nnised mesh on these traps was replaced with smaller-sized stainless steel mesh to try and prevent stick insertion, \nbefore being replaced with stainless steel plate. In 2013/2014, 100 unbaited single-set, ‘run-through’ trap-boxes \nwere also installed below the bushline (see Fig.  1A). These ‘run-through’ trap-boxes only had two horizontal \nwire strands at each end, allowing small mammals to easily pass through the trap-box and potentially trigger \nthe snap-trap. Run-through trap-boxes had been successful at catching stoats at other locations. The DOC 150 \nsnap-traps were activated when a weight similar to that of a stoat was placed on a pressure plate.\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n10\nSCieNtifiC  RepoRTs  |  (2018) 8:13935  | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-32363-9\nStoats could enter most trap-boxes from both ends, but the design of the entrance varied in three main ways. \nEarly trap-boxes and later ‘run-through’ trap-boxes had entrances at each end through which sticks could easily \nbe inserted (Fig. 1A–C). To try and prevent stick insertion, the ends were closed off with small-sized galvanised or \nstainless steel mesh and a side entrance was installed at each end of the housing (Fig. 1D). The side entrance made \nit more difficult for an inserted stick to set off the snap-trap inside. The mesh on the 1745 trap-boxes installed in \n2002 and 2008/2009 began to be replaced with stainless steel plate to prevent the insertion of objects into the ends of \ntrap-boxes (Supplementary Table S1). The interior of all trap-boxes was clearly visible through the mesh barriers, but \nnot when the stainless steel plate was installed. From their first installation in 2002, trap-boxes were inspected, and \nbaited where necessary, usually quarterly in August, November, February and May\n32. We only obtained (incomplete) \ntrap-box inspection records for the period between November 2010 and December 2014. In this approximately \n4-year period the insertion of sticks was only noted on some trap-box inspection records. Stick insertion was not \nrecorded for inspections between July 2012 and December 2013. Also, from November 2010 to June 2012, and in \n2014, stick insertion was not recorded for all trap lines. Thus the stick insertion data we present here provides a \nminimum account of the number of trap-boxes that kea probed into and the frequency of the probing behaviour.\nTrapping staff also manipulated the bait inside trap-boxes to investigate if kea were using sticks to try and \naccess the egg bait rather than the meat bait. In the summer and autumn of 2010–2011, all trap-boxes above the \nbush line on around seven trap lines were only baited with meat and eggs were not used\n38.\nCollection of trail camera footage. Stick insertion into trap-boxes was common along a 2.5 km section \nof trap line in Mystery Burn Valley in the south-east corner of the study area. Trail cameras were installed at \ntrap-boxes along this section and at one trap-box close to an accommodation hut 12 km away (Fig. 2). The cam-\neras were motion-triggered and were set to record video footage in 1 min clips after detecting movement until it \nceased. Five cameras were destroyed by kea and the memory cards were missing. Video footage was obtained at \nthree trap-boxes, and in each case kea visits were filmed: TM20 near the hut above the tree line at 1160 m a.s.l. in \nthe summer of 2013/2014, and LC01 and LC02 at 880 m a.s.l. in mountain beech forest (Fuscospora cliffortoides) \nin the summer of 2014/2015. LC01 and LC02 were 100 m apart. TM20 had one end entrance and contained only \none snap-trap, and LC01 and LC02 had side entrances and contained two snap-traps (see Fig.  1D). All three \ntrap-boxes were baited with food twice during the summer, in November/December and February.\nFrom the video footage we recorded (1) the total time a kea was within ca. 30 cm of a trap-box, (2) the length \nof a session, or visit, to a trap-box by a kea. Sessions were separated by no kea presence in video footage for \nmore than 15 min, (3) the length of time a kea spent in front of either end of a trap-box, (4) the length of time a \nkea spent manipulating a stick at the side entrance of LC01 and LC02, (5) whether a kea used its bill to bite the \ntrap-box housing, (6) whether a kea inserted its head into a trap-box entrance, (7) manipulation of a stick by \nmodifying it, carrying it more than ca. 1 m, flipping it or exchanging it for another stick, (8) the insertion of a stick \ninto a trap-box, and (9) probable play activity.\nData Availability\nThe datasets generated and/or analysed during the current study are available from the corresponding author \n(G.R.H.) on reasonable request, and after any necessary permission has been granted from the New Zealand \nDepartment of Conservation.\nReferences\n 1.
