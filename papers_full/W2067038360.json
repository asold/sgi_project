INTRODUCTION \nEddy current effects are quite important in inductors and \ntransformers for power electronics.  Eddy current losses in \nround wires, including skin and proximity effects in \ntransformers are discussed by Dowell [1] and many new papers \n[2], [3], related to some extent to Dowell’s interpretation and \nresults.  The 2-D analytical approximations are mainly \nfocussed on uniform transverse fields (proximity losses) and \nalso on the own field of a wire (skin-effect losses) [4], [5], [6].  \nThe limitation of the conversion of round wires into \nrectangular ones is improved in [7], [8].  The optimal design \nand minimization of losses in Litz wire windings are provided \nin [9].  Full numerical methods can need up to 1 million of \nelements easily [10].  This affects calculation time and \naccuracy.   \nA conclusion can be made that on one hand, a lot of the \ndesign approaches are a compromise of the accuracy in eddy \ncurrent losses estimation, and on the other hand, the calculation \ntime and complicity.   \nIn this paper a time-saving high accuracy method for eddy \ncurrent loss calculation in transformer windings is introduced.  \nThe proposed approach is applicable for transformers in wide \nrange of designs using round wires.  \nII. PROPOSED WIDE FREQUENCY APPROACH FOR CALCULATING \nEDDY CURRENT LOSSES IN TRANSFORMER WINDINGS \nFirst, low frequency (LF) approximation is considered [11].  \nThe LF approximation is the starting point of the proposed \napproach.   \nThe LF approximation is applicable when the eddy currents, \ninduced in the winding do not considerably change the applied \nfield inside the conductor.  The LF approximation is valid up \nδ6.1\n£d [11], (d is the wire diameter and d\n is the penetration \ndepth μω\nρ2δ c= , f2πω=  is the frequency of the applied \nmagnetic field; m is the permeability of the material (for copper \nm @ mo ), mo is the permeability of free \nspace; 6\no 1025664.1μ -´= ; rc is the electrical resistivity of the \nconducting material (copper), for copper mΩ1023ρ 9\nc\n-´=  at \n100°C; mΩ1017ρ 9\nc\n-´=  at 25°C.   \nThe major part of the eddy current losses in LF \napproximation for round wires can be explained by the \npresence of a transverse magnetic field, which acts like an \ninduction heating to the wire.  To express the eddy current \nlosses )(, tP eddycu , the following equation can be used: \n \n \n2\nc\n4\n, ρ64\nπ\n)( ÷\nø\nöç\nè\næ= dt\ndBdl\ntP\nw\neddycu  (1) \n \nwhere: \nd is the practical diameter of the copper wire of the \nconsidered winding; \nB is the induction, assumed perpendicular to the wire axis;  \nlw  is the wire length of the winding  \n \nThe equation (1) is quite general and applicable even for the \ncases with more complicated field distribution, e.g. for non-\nsinusoidal waveforms, [3].   \n \nA. Eddy current losses factor k c  \nTo extend the validity of (1) for larger diameters, and a wide \nfrequency range, the loss factor kc is introduced. The factor kc \nrepresents the ratio between the eddy current losses compared \nto the losses in the ohmic resistance of the winding of the \nmagnetic component.   \nUsing the above introduced loss factor kc, the eddy current \nlosses are given by the following equation  \n \n ( ) caceddy kIRP 2\n0=  (2) \n \nwhere: \nkc is the loss factor, depends on the operating frequency f, \nthe wire diameter d and the distance between the \nconductors, presented by the parameter η and the distance \nbetween the layers presented by the parameter λ; \nIac is the AC current component; \n0R  is the ohmic resistance of the winding. \n \nThe copper fill factor in the direction of the layer h can be \ndefined as )/ wdn=h , where d is the wire diameter; n in the \nnumber of turns in a layer; w is the winding width. \nThe copper fill factor in the direction perpendicular to the \nlayer l can be defined as hdmE /λ = , where h is the window \nheight (for mE see below).  \nTo allow an easy use of kc, we provide two sets of graphs \nshown in Fig.1 and Fig.2, giving the additional coefficient ktf. \nFor the transformers the value of the coefficient kc is:  \n \n tfc kmk E\n2»  (3) \n \nwhere the value of ktf  is found using Fig.1 and Fig.2.  \n \nThe parameter mE (equivalent number of layers) is defined as \nthe number of layers going from no field to the maximum field.   \nFor p parallel wires a number of wires is present in the same \nlayer, which will become an equivalent number of wires in a \nlayer: mmE = . \nFor Litz wire  one cannot count exactly the number of \nindividual wires in a layer. We distribute the equivalent turns \nin both directions and then we have:  pmmE = , where  p is \nthe number of paralleled strands.   \nFor interleaved windings in transformers (and no parallel \nwires) KmmE /= , where K is the field symmetry factor [11].  \nThis presentation is also necessary for so called ‘half layers’. \nIt is not recommended to use partially filled layers in \ntransformer designs. If anyhow partially filled layers are used, \nin the proposed method, the wires should be equally spread.  \nThe effect of the partially filled layers is reduced at high values \nof mE. \nThe graphs are obtained by approximating the exact solution \nfor eddy current losses for different cases, found by using \nsoftware package MathCad [11].  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 1 Transformer cases, typical transformer factor ktf for d=0.5mm, h=0.9, \nr=23´10-9 and l=0.5, 1) dotted line: half layer, mE=0.5; 2) solid line: single layer, \nmE=1; 3) dashed: two layers, mE=2; 4) dash-dot: three or more layers, mE>2. \nLF – low frequency approximation. \n \n \n \n \nFig. 2 Transformer cases, typical transformer factor ktf for d=0.5mm, h=0.7, \nr=23´10-9 and l=0.5, 1) dotted line: half layer, mE=0.5; 2) solid line: single layer, \nmE=1; 3) dashed: two layers, mE=2; 4) dash-dot: three or more layers, mE>2. \nLF – low frequency approximation. \n \nTo unify the use of the graphs , we introduce a reference \ndiameter, an apparent frequency and an equivalent frequency. \n \nB. Apparent frequency calculation \nIn (2), the apparent frequency should be used. \n1. In general, one has to sum the contribution of each \ncurrent harmonic in order to calculate losses.  In the presented \nmethod, for sinusoidal currents no corrections have to be made \nand the apparent frequency fap is the real one:  \n ffap =  (4) \n2. For a symmetrical triangular current waveform, in the \nlow frequency approximation we obtain the following apparent \nfrequency fap: \n fffap 10.132 »p=  (5) \n3. At high frequency, the losses tend to increase with the \nroot of frequency for a given current. In that case, the \ncontribution of harmonics in the current is low and one can use \nthe rms value of the current instead of summing over all \nharmonics.  For a symmetrical triangular current waveform, \nthis results in an apparent frequency fap: \n ffap 025.1»  (6) \n \nC. Reference wire diameter \nThe choice of 0.5mm as a reference wire diameter is done in \norder to use a typical wire diameter for power electronics.  The \nfrequency, for which the penetration depth is equal to the \nreference diameter d=d, is 20kHz.  The limit of the ‘low \nfrequency (LF) approximation’ for the reference diameter \nd=0.5mm is 50kHz, thus LF can be applied below 50kHz for \nthat wire diameter.  These values are easy to remember.  The \ndiameters of wires in adjacent layers are taken equal and in a \nsquare fitting.  This is the worst-case design, as a hexagonal \nfitting usually reduces the losses.  \n \nD. Equivalent frequency calculation \nTo use the provided graphs (Fig.1, Fig.2) for any frequency, \nwire diameter and conductor resistivity, the equivalent \nfrequency of the considered case should be first found:  \n \n \n÷÷\nø\nö\nçç\nè\næ\nr\n´÷\nø\nöç\nè\næ=\n-\nc\napeq\ndff\n92\n1023\n5.0  (7) \n \nwhere: \nfap is the apparent frequency; \nd is the wire diameter in [mm]; \nr\nc is the conductor resistivity in [Wm]. \n \nFor fast calculation, the waveforms and resistivity could be \nneglected, but the diameter effect has still to be taken into \naccount by the following simplified expression: \n \n \n2\nmm5.0 ÷÷\nø\nö\nçç\nè\næ» dffeq  (8) \nIII. SHORT EXAMPLES OF APPLYING THE PROPOSED APPROACH \nThe graphs shown in Fig.1 and Fig.2 concern a design \nexample with a typical wire diameter of 0.5mm and the usual \nfrequency range for power electronics: 10kHz to 10MHz.  For \nmore than two layers ( mE>2), the result is almost independent \nof the number of layers.  The usual values of h in transformers \nare between 0.7 (typical for thin wires and Litz wire) and 0.9 \n(typical for d>0.5mm).  For other values of h, a linear \ninterpolation between Fig.1 and Fig.2 can be done. The \nadditional error due to that interpolation is below 2%. \nA few short examples of transformer designs show the use \nof the graphs in Fig.1 and Fig.2. \n \n1) A single layer winding of a transformer uses a wire \ndiameter of 0.9 mm and an outer diameter of 1mm, the \nfrequency is 30kHz, the copper resistivity is r =23´10-9 W m.  \nWe have 9.0mm1mm/9.0η\n== , so we use Fig.1.  We have \nto keep the same diameter/penetration depth ratio, i.e. to find \nthe equivalent frequency feq = 30kHz´(0.9/0.5)2 = 97.2 kHz. \nReading from Fig.1 gives ktf=0.473.  It is a single layer \ntransformer, so 1\n=Em  and we obtain kc=ktf=0.473.  \n \n2) The same wire diameters and resistivity as in 1), but a \nthree-layer transformer winding, using a three times smaller \nwinding width, the same turn number. \nWe use the same values 9.0η\n=  and feq=97.2 kHz. It is a \nthree-layer transformer, so 3=Em .  For 3 layers and more, \nwe read ktf =0.575 from Fig.1. Then we have 17.532 == tfc kk .  \n \n3) The same wire diameters and resistivity as above , but \na half layer transformer design (the considered single layer \nsecondary is sandwiched between two primary windings). \nUsing the same values 9.0η\n=  and feq=97.2 kHz, we read \nfrom Fig.1 ktf =0.166. It is a half-layer transformer, so \n5.0=Em  and we have 0415.05.0 2 == tfc kk .  This value is \nmuch lower than the cases 1) and 2) above.  The reason is that \nin this design case, the transverse field is zero and only local \nfields are present.  In practical realizations, the half layer \nsolutions indeed perform well, but a non-careful winding (e.g. \nnon-equal winding width of the layers) generates parasitic \ntransverse fields that increase the losses considerably. \n \n4) A two layer transformer winding of 0.5 mm copper \ndiameter at 50 kHz and packing factor in the direction of the \nlayer h=0.8, copper resistivity rc=23´10-9 Wm. \nWe have the same diameter as the graphs, so the equivalent \nfrequency is equal to the applied frequency.  We obtain \n170.09.0, =tfk  from Fig.1 and 104.07.0, =tfk  form Fig.2.  To \nfind ktf,0.8  (for h=0.8), we take the average of the two values \n137.02/)170.0104.0(8.0, =+=tfk . Then we find \n549.02 8.0,\n2 == tfc kk .  \n \nIV. PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROPOSED APPROACH \nA.  Realized Transformer Design  \nA welding transformer is designed using the “fast design \napproach”, proposed in [12].   The method, presented here, is \napplied for calculating the eddy current losses of the primary \nand secondary windings of that transformer. \nThe transformer contains 2 identical coils connected in \nparallel.   Each coil contains a primary winding with number of \nturns N=20. Each primary winding includes two windings in \nparallel, Fig.3.  Secondary winding of each coil (5 turns, 2 \nconductors in parallel) is sandwiched between the two primary \nwindings of each coil.  \nThe arrangement of the windings is shown in Fig.3. \nThe realized transformer is pictured in Fig.4. \nThe specifications of the designed transformer are:  \nUpri=300V; Pout=2.5kW (continuous power) \nCore: U 80/40/25; Primary Winding: N=20, d=1.18 [mm]; \nSecondary Winding: N=5, d=2 [mm] \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 3.

Winding Loss Calculations \nPrimary Winding\n -A single layer winding, wire diameter of \n1.18 mm, the frequency is 60kHz, the copper resistivity is \nr=21´10-9 W m.  \nWe have 908.0mm26/12018.1/η\n=´´== mmwpNd . \nWe have to keep the same diameter/penetration depth ratio, i.e. \nwe have to find the equivalent frequency. We use (7) \n \nkHz36621\n23\n5.0\n18.1kHz60\n2\n1, =÷\nø\nöç\nè\næ÷\nø\nöç\nè\næ=eqf  (9) \nWe read ktf,0.9=2.15 from Fig. 1 for h=0.9.  The actual value \nh2=0.908 is very close to h=0.9.  It is a single layer \ntransformer, so 1=Em  and we obtain kc=ktf=2.15.  \nThen, using (2) we obtain the eddy current losses of the \nprimary winding.  The total losses in the primary winding are \nthe sum of ohmic and eddy current losses. \nSecondary Winding  – A half layer transformer design \n5.0=Em  (the considered single layer secondary is sandwiched \nbetween two primaries), 2 wires in parallel, wire diameter of 2 \nmm, the frequency is 60kHz, the copper resistivity is r \n=21´10-9 W m.  \nWe have 769.0mm26/252/η =´´== mmwpNd .

The actual value of h for the secondary is \nh2=0.769.  Using the found two values and interpolating for \nh2=0.769, we obtain ktf »5.149. It is a half layer transformer, so \nmE=0.5 and we obtain 287.15.0 2 == tfc kk .  \nThe calculated results for the total losses of both primary \nand secondary windings are tabulated in Table 1. \n  \nTABLE 1 CALCULATED RESULTS FOR THE EXPERIMENTAL TRANSFORMER \n ktf kc Pohm [W] P eddy [W] P cu,i [W] \nprimary 2.15 2.15 1.455 3.129 4.584 \nsecondary 5.149 1.287 2.059 2.65 4.709 \n \nThe total losses in primary and secondary windings are: \n293.9709.4584.42,1, =+=+= cucucu PPP  (11) \nC.
