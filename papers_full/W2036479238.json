This article is published with open access at Springerlink.com\nAbstract We report the ﬁrst observation of probe tool use\nby a wild adult female bearded capuchin ( Sapajus libidnio-\nsus), at Serra da Capivara National Park (SCNP), Brazil. This\nindividual used several stick tools and one grass stem to probe\nher nostrils, usually triggering a sneeze reaction, and also used\nstick tools to probe her teeth or gum. Both of these behaviours\nwere accompanied by inspection and licking of the tool fol-\nlowing use. We have termed these self-directed actions nasal\nprobe and toothpick, and neither has been previously reported\nin wild capuchins. While stick tool use is common among\nforaging male capuchins at SCNP, the novel and at present\nidiosyncratic activities performed by the female monkey add\nto the known behavioural repertoire for this species.\nKeywords Capuchin monkey /C1 Sapajus libidinosus /C1\nStick tool /C1 Nasal probe /C1 Toothpick\nIntroduction\nIn the past decade, the establishment of long-term ﬁeld\nstudies of wild Brazilian bearded capuchin monkeys ( Sa-\npajus libidinosus ) has revealed abundant evidence of tool\nuse in this species (Ottoni and Izar 2008). Most attention\nhas been given to capuchin use of stones to break open\nencased fruits and seeds, tasks for which they select and\ntransport suitable tools to nut-cracking sites, leaving dis-\ntinct traces of this activity on the landscape (Visalberghi\net al. 2013; Haslam et al. 2014). However, wild capuchin\ngroups in Serra da Capivara National Park (SCNP)\ndemonstrate a wider range of tool materials and behaviour\nthan seen elsewhere, including use of stones in sexual\ndisplays and digging tasks, and use of vegetative probes to\nextract small prey from crevices, threaten dangerous ani-\nmals, and obtain foods such as honey (Mannu and Ottoni\n2009; Falo´tico and Ottoni 2013, 2014).\nHere, we report two new self-directed plant tool be-\nhaviours performed by a female S. libidinosus at SCNP, the\nﬁrst evidence of adult female probe tool use in wild ca-\npuchins. Intriguingly, use of probe tools is almost exclu-\nsively practiced by male capuchins at SCNP, comprising\n97 % of observations during a long-term study of SCNP\ncapuchin tool-use behaviour (Falo ´tico 2011; Falo´tico and\nOttoni 2014). No adult female has been seen to use a probe\ntool for foraging, and the only prior instance of an adult\nfemale using a stick tool was when one capuchin used a stick\nto poke the individual she was grooming (Falo´tico and Ottoni\n2014). There is no ecological explanation for the stark sexual\nbias in probe tool behaviour at SCNP, since females prey on\nand consume the same plant and animal items to which males\ndirect their probe tool use. At present, a bias towards male\ncapuchins at SCNP, in either learning opportunities or on-\ntogeny, are being considered as possible explanations.\nMethods\nSCNP is located in Piauı ´, northeastern Brazil.

The current study was\nconducted in September 2014 with the Jurubeba group,\nwhich has been studied since 2004 (Mannu and Ottoni\n2009) and consisted of 54 identiﬁed individuals at that\ntime. The reported observations occurred at 8 /C17652.50 S,\n42/C17638.00 W, and were conducted opportunistically by video\nrecording with a Sony PJ530E camcorder.\nResults\nOn 28 September 2014, at approximately 10:14 am, MH\nobserved one adult female (Aca ´cia) being groomed by an\nadult male (Choquito). While being groomed, Aca ´cia was\nseen using at least four tools to probe her nose and mouth\nover a period of about 5 min (Online Resource 1). The ﬁrst\nobserved probe was a thin and ﬂexible grass-like stem\n(Table 1: Tool A), while the following three probes were\nshort ( *10–15 cm long; Fig. 1a), rigid sticks collected by\nthe monkey from among those naturally lying on the rocky\nsubstrate at the site (Table 1: Tools B–D). Based on these\nobservations we have deﬁned two novel tool-use be-\nhaviours for wild capuchins, nasal probe and toothpick, as\nfollows:\nNasal probe : careful insertion of a thin plant tool into\nthe nostril, usually triggering a sneeze reaction, accompa-\nnied by inspection of the probe tool.\nToothpick: precise placement of one end of a thin plant\ntool into the mouth, held in position against a tooth or the\ngum, followed by rapid side-to-side movement of the tool\nand its inspection once withdrawn from the mouth.\nWe recorded a total of 13 nasal probe insertions\n(Fig. 1b), ten of which were followed by one or two\nsneezes. The nasal probe insertion was done very carefully,\nand in each case insertion ceased if a sneeze was triggered.\nAca´cia would then vigorously rub her nose with her hand\nand arm. Only a small volume of mucus, if any, was dis-\ncharged with each triggered sneeze. Nasal probing pro-\nduced an average of just over one sneeze per use, and the\ncapuchin licked the tool afterwards on fewer than half of\nthe 13 occasions (Table 1). Licking was more common\nduring toothpick tool use, which never elicited a sneeze.\nTooth picking (Fig. 1c) was performed with a quicker\nmotion, but still with care taken to repeatedly place the tip\nof the probe at the same location inside the mouth. Aca ´cia\nappeared to be working at, or rubbing the base of the teeth\nTable 1 Frequency of nasal probe (NP) and toothpick (TP) be-\nhaviours, with accompanying reactions, by an adult female capuchin\nmonkey in Serra da Capivara National Park\nBehaviour Tool A Tool B Tool C Tool D Total\nNasal probe (NP) 1 8 4 0 13\nNP sneeze a 01 1 301 4\nNP lick 1 3 1 0 5\nToothpick (TP) 0 6 0 1 7\nTP lick 0 7 0 1 8\nThe tools were used sequentially (A–D)\na We recorded 21 additional sneezes, but could not directly correlate\nthese with tool use\nFig. 1 Adult female bearded\ncapuchin probe tool use, Serra\nda Capivara National Park:\na inspection of stick tool;\nb nasal probe; c toothpick;\nd licking the tool following\ntoothpick behaviour. The tool in\nthe pictures is Tool B\n212 Primates (2015) 56:211–214\n123\nor her gums on the upper right side of her mouth, beneath\nher lip. Once the tool was in place, she worked the hand-\nheld end of the tool rapidly back and forth. We recorded\nseven instances of toothpick tool use, all of which involved\ntwo of the more robust stick probe tools (Tools B and D)\nrather than the ﬂexible grass tool. Aca ´cia used one of the\nprobes (Tool B) to perform both the nasal probe and\ntoothpick behaviours, interspersing one with the other. She\nregularly inspected and licked the tools during both types\nof tool use (Fig. 1d), although we were unable to determine\nwhether this was to remove dislodged material from the\ntool’s tip or for some other purpose.\nDiscussion\nThe use of a stick tool as a nasal probe and toothpick is\nidiosyncratic, and may therefore be an innovation on behalf\nof this female capuchin. Self-directed stick tool use has\nbeen noted previously in several wild great ape popula-\ntions, as well as in wild monkeys (Shumaker et al. 2011).\nSpeciﬁc behaviours similar to those described here for the\nSerra da Capivara capuchin have also occasionally been\nreported in captive individuals, including at habitual level\n(McGrew and Tutin 1973; Bayart and Anderson 1985).\nHowever, we focus here on wild or free-living animals to\navoid potential inﬂuences from humans on captive or\nprovisioned primate tool use behaviour (Haslam 2013).\nPrimate insertion of a stick probe into their own nasal\ncavity has been reported in detail only for an adult male\nchimpanzee ( Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii ) in the Mahale\nMountains National Park, Tanzania (Nishida and Naka-\nmura 1993; Nishida et al. 2009). Over more than a decade,\nthis chimpanzee used multiple vegetation probes to trigger\na sneeze reaction and clear its nasal passage, including\nwhile it displayed ﬂu-like symptoms. One other member of\nthe same group at Mahale, an adolescent female, has been\nobserved independently performing the same behaviour,\nwhich it did twice in the space of a few minutes (Marchant\nand McGrew 1999). This behaviour is classiﬁed as rare in\nsurveys of putative chimpanzee cultural variants (Whiten\net al. 1999, 2001).\nWhile the observed capuchin behaviour did not produce\na noticeable volume of mucus, and the individual did not\ndisplay any ﬂu-like symptoms, we cannot rule out nasal\nclearing as a potential proximate cause. It may also be that\nan irritant was lodged in the capuchin’s nasal passage, and\nif so, it was not dislodged during the several sneezing\nepisodes that were observed over a 5-min period. Neither\ncan we rule out use of the probe tool as simply a self-\ninspection or curiosity-driven behaviour. The Mahale nasal\nprobing was reported as a potential parallel behaviour to\nself-medication in chimpanzees, and an example of\ndeliberate manipulation of an involuntary body response\n(sneezing) to relieve an unpleasant condition (Nishida and\nNakamura 1993). While the direct comparison of chim-\npanzee and capuchin behaviour can be informative\n(Visalberghi and McGrew 1997), it is unclear at this point\nwhether there is any convergence between these taxa in the\nrare reports of nasal probing behaviour. The care with\nwhich Aca´cia introduced the probe to her nose, and the\nregular continuation of the probe insertion until a sneeze\nwas provoked, suggest that sneezing may have been an\nintended aim of her tool use behaviour, but we cannot\nspeculate further at present.\nStick tool use for cleaning or picking at teeth has been\nreported for a slightly wider variety of wild primates,\nalthough this behaviour has not been described in detail for\nany of them and to our knowledge none reach habitual\nlevel. For example, an adult male bonobo ( Pan paniscus )a t\nthe Wamba site, Democratic Republic of Congo, was ob-\nserved using twigs to clean his teeth on two occasions, one\nof which also involved modifying the tool before use\n(Ingmanson 1996). Long-tailed macaques ( M. fascicularis )\nin Central Java, Indonesia, have also been reported to brush\ntheir teeth with twigs (Watanabe et al. 2007), and oran-\ngutan ( Pongo abelii ) use of sticks as toothpicks has been\nnoted as a present but rare behaviour at the Ketambe and\nSuaq Bulimba sites in Sumatra (van Schaik et al. 2008;\nMeulman and van Schaik 2013). The capuchin’s deliberate\nand repeated use of a probe tool to target the same tooth or\ngum area suggests that the purpose was either relieving\ndiscomfort or dislodging an irritant.\nAside from the proximate mechanisms inducing the\nobserved tool behaviours, which remain unclear, we can\nconsider the wider context within which the behaviour\noccurred. Foremost is the fact that adult female capuchins\nhave not previously been reported to use probe tools in the\nwild. Only 3 % ( n = 13) of SCNP probe tool use has been\nseen among female capuchins, all of which were juveniles.\nThis report therefore demonstrates that the observed sexual\nbias does not result from any impediment to such actions in\nwild adult females, which is as expected from studies of\ncaptive capuchins (Westergaard and Fragaszy 1987). We\ndo note, however, that the female probe tool use was self-\ndirected, whereas foraging probes appear to be used ex-\nclusively by males at SCNP. Another difference is that\nAca´cia never modiﬁed the tool prior to or during its use,\nwhile probe use by males involves modiﬁcation most of the\ntime (64 %) (Falo ´tico and Ottoni 2014). The length of\nAca´cia’s probe tools falls at the low end of foraging probes\nobserved at SCNP, which have a median of 23.3 cm, an\naverage of 27.94 ± 14.97 cm, and a range of 6.5–98.2 cm\n(Falo´tico and Ottoni 2014).\nChoquito, the male that was grooming Aca ´cia during her\nprobe use, had very close and repeated opportunities to\nPrimates (2015) 56:211–214 213\n123\nobserve her behaviour, but no other capuchins were paying\nattention to Aca ´cia during the observed tool use session.\nFuture monitoring of the multiple capuchin groups inhab-\niting SCNP will enable us to determine whether the ob-\nserved behaviour can spread via social learning to become\na tradition, or remains an idiosyncrasy.\nAcknowledgments We thank Eduardo Ottoni, Clara Corat, Fran-\ncisco ‘Chico’ Reinaldo, and FUMDHAM for their support and advice.\nFunding was received from a European Research Council Starting\nGrant (#283959 Primate Archaeology) awarded to MH, and the\nFundac¸a˜o de Amparo a ` Pesquisa do Estado de Sa ˜o Paulo (#2013/\n05219-0 awarded to TF; #2014/04818-0 awarded to Eduardo Ottoni).\nAll applicable international, national, and/or institutional guidelines\nfor the care and use of animals were followed.
