  "abstract": "ABSTRACT Introduction Although the potential utility of large language models (LLMs) in medicine and healthcare is substantial, no assessment has been made to date of how GPs want LLMs to be applied in primary care, or of which issues GPs are most concerned about regarding the implementation of LLMs into their clinical practice. This study's objective was to generate preliminary evidence that answers these questions, which are relevant because GPs themselves will ultimately harness the power of LLMs in primary care. Methods Non‐probability sampling was utilised: GPs practicing in the UK and who were members of one of two Facebook groups (one containing a community of UK primary care staff, the other containing a community of GMC‐registered doctors in the UK) were invited to complete an online survey, which ran from 06 to 13 November 2024. Results The survey received 113 responses, 107 of which were from GPs practicing in the UK. When LLM accuracy and safety were assumed to be guaranteed, broad enthusiasm for LLMs carrying out various nonclinical and clinical tasks in primary care was reported. The single nonclinical task and clinical task that respondents were most supportive of were the LLM listening to the consultation and writing notes in real‐time for the GP to review, edit, and save (44.0%), and the LLM identifying outstanding clinical tasks and actioning them (51.0%), respectively. Respondents were concerned with a range of issues regarding LLMs being embedded into clinical systems, with patient safety being the most commonly reported single issue of concern (36.2%). Discussion This study has generated preliminary evidence that is of potential utility to those developing LLMs for use in primary care. Further research is required to expand this evidence base to further inform the development of these technologies, and to ensure they are acceptable to the GPs who will use them.",
