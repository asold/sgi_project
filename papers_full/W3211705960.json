In the present study, we \ncompared the tool-using behavior in captive colonies of two closely related myrmicine ants with different feeding preferences: \nAphaenogaster subterranea, an omnivorous species, and Messor structor, a mainly granivorous seed-harvester species. We \nsupplied foraging ants with honey-water baits and six types of objects they could use as tools: sand grains, small soil grains, \nlarge soil grains, pine needles, leaves, and sponges. We found that the workers of A. subterranea both dropped more tools into \nhoney-water baits and retrieved more of these tools than the workers of M. structor. While A. subterranea preferred smaller \ntools over larger ones, tool preferences for M. structor did not differ significantly from random. In addition, tool dropping \nwas significantly faster in A. subterranea, and both the dropping and retrieving of tools began significantly earlier than in \nM. structor. For Aphaenogaster species that regularly utilize and compete for liquid food sources, the ability to efficiently \ntransport liquid food via tools may be more important than it is for seed-harvester ants. Dropping tools into liquids, however, \nmay still be useful for seed-harvester species as a means to supplement diet with liquid food during periods of seed shortage \nand also to serve as a means of getting rid of unwanted liquids close to the nest.\nKeywords Aphaenogaster subterranea · Food transport · Feeding strategy · Messor structor · Tool-using behavior\nIntroduction\nIn the last few decades, the study of tool use has been a \ngeneral interest among researchers of animal behavior. Even \nthough there is an increasing number of publications in the \ntopic, we know little about the origin of this behavior, espe-\ncially in insects. One example of the many types of insect \ntool use is the foraging behavior of some myrmicine ants. \nDuring this behavior, ants place various debris items (e.g., \npieces of soil, leaves, pine needles, etc.) into liquid food, and \nthen they carry the food-soaked tools back to the nest (e.g., \nFellers and Fellers 1976; Banschbach et al. 2006). The most \ntypical representatives of this behavior are the members of \nthe genus Aphaenogaster (Fellers and Fellers 1976; Tanaka \nand Ono 1978 ; Fowler 1982 ; McDonald 1984 ; Agbogba \n1985; Cerdá et al. 1988; Banschbach et al. 2006; Lőrinczi \n2014; Maák et al. 2017; Lőrinczi et al. 2018; Maák et al. \n2020; Módra et al. 2020), but it has also been observed in \nMessor barbarus (Durán 2011), Messor structor (Módra \net al. 2017), Novomessor albisetosus (McDonald 1984; Wet-\nterer et al. 2002), Pogonomyrmex badius (Morrill 1972), \nSolenopsis invicta (Barber et al. 1989; Qin et al. 2019), and \nSolenopsis richteri (Zhou et al. 2020). Contrary to the views \nof some authors (e.g., Durán 2011), this behavior completely \nsatisfies the criteria of tool use (see Módra et al. 2020) \naccording to the currently accepted definition, which is “…\nthe exertion of control over a freely manipulable external \nobject (the tool) with the goal of (1) altering the physical \nproperties of another object, substance, surface or medium \n(the target, which may be the tool user or another organ-\nism) via a dynamic mechanical interaction, or (2) mediat-\ning the flow of information between the tool user and the \nInsectes Sociaux\n * Gábor Lőrinczi \n lorinczig@gmail.com\n1 Department of Ecology, University of Szeged, Közép fasor \n52, Szeged 6726, Hungary\n2 Museum and Institute of Zoology, Polish Academy \nof Sciences, Wilcza Street 64, Warsaw 00-679, Poland\n3 Doctoral School of Environmental Sciences, University \nof Szeged, Rerrich Béla tér 1, Szeged 6720, Hungary\n6 G. Módra et al.\n1 3\nenvironment or other organisms in the environment” (St. \nAmant and Horton 2008).\nAlthough the tool-using behavior of Aphaenogaster spe-\ncies has been a subject of many studies in the past few years \n(Lőrinczi 2014; Maák et al. 2017; Lőrinczi et al. 2018; Maák \net al. 2020; Módra et al. 2020), our knowledge of the forag-\ning tool use of other myrmicine ants, as well as the origin of \nthis behavior is rather limited. Furthermore, there is almost \nno direct evidence for the occurrence of foraging tool use \nin ants under natural conditions (i.e., in the wild on natural \nfood sources). Based on a few observations and assump-\ntions, rotten fruits, haemolymph of arthropods or droplets of \nhoneydew released by hemipterans could trigger tool drop-\nping in Aphaenogaster species (Fellers and Fellers 1976; \nAgbogba 1985; Módra et al. 2020). According to Alcock’s \n(1972) hypothesis about the evolution of tool use, a non-\ntool-using behavior could potentially evolve into tool use, \ngiven the appropriate ecological context and the suitable \nphenotypic change in the pre-existing behavior (Hunt et al. \n2013). Many ant species cover liquids close to their nest \nto protect nestmate workers from drowning or entangle-\nment (Wheeler 1910). This behavior may have evolved into \nforaging tool use (Fellers and Fellers 1976), and the fact \nthat most of the known tool user species lack the ability to \nperform oral trophallaxis (Agbogba 1985) seems to support \nthis hypothesis. Trophallaxis, i.e., the exchange of internally \nstored liquid food via regurgitation, is a common mechanism \nof sharing food among colony members in ants (Meurville \nand LeBoeuf 2021), and the absence of this fundamental \nability may have fostered the development of alternative \nfood-sharing methods in the affected groups of ants. Seed-\nharvester ants belonging to the genus Messor, which are \nclose relatives of Aphaenogaster  species, are also known \nto use tools when feeding on liquids, at least in the labora-\ntory or on artificial liquid baits (Durán 2011; Módra et al. \n2017). Based on the observations of Durán (2011) with Mes-\nsor barbarus, and the fact that Messor species are mainly \ngranivorous (Plowes et al. 2013), we can postulate that they \nhave different, presumably simpler tool-using behavior as \ncompared to the mostly omnivorous members of the genus \nAphaenogaster.\nThe aim of the present study was to compare the tool-\nusing behavior of two closely related myrmicine ants with \ndifferent feeding behaviors, A. subterranea, an omnivorous \nspecies, and M.  structor, a granivorous species. We tested \nthe hypothesis that due to the difference in diet, the tool-\nusing behavior (i.e., the number of tools used, tool prefer -\nence, and the rate of tool usage) differs in these two species, \nbeing more complex and vigorous in A.  subterranea than \nin M. structor. Based on our hypothesis, we predicted that \n(1) more tools would be dropped and retrieved by the work-\ners of A. subterranea  than those of M. structor , (2) there \nwould be a preference for the use of certain types of tools in \nA. subterranea contrary to M. structor, (3) the rate of tool \ndropping would be faster in A. subterranea than in M. struc-\ntor, and (4) the dropping and retrieving of tools would start \nearlier in A. subterranea as compared to M. structor.\nMethods\nStudy species\nAphaenogaster subterranea (Latreille, 1798) (Fig. S1) \nis widely distributed in Europe and southwest Asia \n(Czechowski et al. 2012). Natural habitats are relatively \nhumid and warm deciduous forests (Czechowski et al. 2012; \nSeifert 2018). Nests are usually built under stones, wood \nlogs or at bases of trees, sometimes in decaying wood or in \nleaf litter (Lőrinczi 2011; Czechowski et al. 2012; Seifert \n2018). Colonies are thought to be monogynous with up to \nseveral thousand workers (Czechowski et al. 2012; Seifert \n2018). Zoophagous and has trophobiotic relationships with \nvarious subterranean hemipterans (Lőrinczi 2012; Seifert \n2018), but also feeds on seeds and elaiosomes (Bas et al. \n2009).\nMessor structor (Latreille, 1798) (Fig. S1) is widely dis-\ntributed in Europe, west Asia, and central Asia (Czechowski \net al. 2012). Natural habitats are xerothermous grasslands \nwith rich seed vegetation. Nests are built in the soil with \nusually no other above-ground structure than weak rings \nof ejected soil material. Colonies are often polygynous and \npolydomous with up to several thousand workers (Seifert \n2018). A granivorous and frugivorous species, but during \nperiods of seed shortage diet is supplemented by other plant \nparts, arthropod carcasses, and fecal droppings of birds and \nmammals (Czechowski et al. 2012; Seifert 2018).\nLaboratory experiments\nWe worked with five laboratory-reared colonies each of \nA. subterranea and M. structor. The colonies of both spe-\ncies originated from individual colony-founding queens, \nwhich were collected from different locations. Colonies were \nabout the same size with approximately 25–40 workers and \na single queen. We housed the colonies in plastic boxes (L \n12 cm × W 12 cm × H 10 cm) with natural nesting materials \n(soil, leaf litter). Nest boxes were connected with a plastic \ntube (1 cm in diameter, 5 cm in length) to a foraging arena \n(L 13.5 cm × W 10 cm × H 7.5 cm) where the experiments \nwere performed (Fig. 1). Colonies were kept under constant \nconditions (temperature 24 ± 4 °C; 14:10 h light:dark cycle). \nWater was sprayed into the nest boxes every day to maintain \nhumidity and to satisfy the water need of ants. Food was \navailable only every second day to avoid losing interest in \n7Comparison of foraging tool use in two species of myrmicine ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae)  \n1 3\nbaits during the experiments. Experiments were preceded by \nfour days of starvation period.\nWe used six types of objects as tools: sand grains (ca. \n0.5 mm in diameter), small soil grains (ca. 1 mm in diam-\neter), large soil grains (ca. 2 mm in diameter), pieces of pine \nneedles (ca. 8 mm in length), pieces of leaves (ca. 5 mm in \ndiameter), and pieces of sponges (ca. 5 mm in diameter) \n(Fig.  1). As baits, we used a mixture of honey and water \n(1:3), which was added as a single drop (ca. 0.5 ml) on a \n4 cm diameter plastic disc (Fig.  1, Fig. S1). During the \nexperiments, honey-water baits were placed in the centre of \nthe foraging arena, 7 cm from the arena entrance (Fig.  1). \nTools were mixed in equal volume, and a mixture (ca. 7  cm3 \nin total) was settled 4 cm from the baits. With this setup, we \ncould avoid the effect of distance during tool selection (see \nLőrinczi et al. 2018 ). Observation periods began when the \nfirst workers found the bait. Each observation period lasted \n30 s and was repeated every two and half minutes for 5 h for \neach colony. During each observation period, we recorded \nthe type and number of tools dropped into honey-water baits, \nand the type and number of food-soaked tools retrieved and \ntransported to the nest. To minimize observer bias, blinded \nmethods were used when all behavioral data were recorded.\nData analysis\nGeneralized linear mixed models (GLMM, Poisson error, \nmaximum likelihood fit, N  = 7200) were used to test the \neffect of the ant species and the types of tools on the num-\nber of tools dropped into and retrieved from the baits. In the \nfull models, the type of tools (sand grains, small and large \nsoil grains, pine needles, leaves and sponges), the ant species \nand the interaction of the two were included as fixed factors, \nwhereas the nest ID was a random factor.\nThe dropping rate of different tool types on the liquids \nwas analyzed with a Cox regression model (N = 556). In the \nfull model, the type of tools (sand grains, small and large \nsoil grains, pine needles, leaves, and sponges), the ant spe-\ncies and the interaction of the two were included as fixed \nfactors, whereas the nest ID was a random factor.\nTo compare the differences in timing between the two \nspecies we used randomization models (N  = 10). We used \ndifferent models to compare the time when the tool dropping \ninto baits and when the tool retrieving from the baits started, \nwhereas also the time spent between the two was considered. \nIn every case, we built one model for all of the combinations \n(N = 252) of the values found for different colonies belong-\ning to different species. The p values were gained after sum-\nming up the results of all the models.\nAll statistical analyses were carried out in the R Statistical \nEnvironment (R Core Team 2019). If necessary, the vari -\nables were log-transformed prior to the analyses to meet the \nnormality and homogeneity of variances. In model overdis-\npersion, a negative binomial error structure was applied (see \nLindén and Mäntyniemi 2011). GLMMs were performed \nusing the glmer function in lme4 package (Bates et al. 2015), \nautomated model selection with the help of dredge function \nin MuMIn package, whereas the coefficients of determina-\ntion for linear mixed-effect models were calculated using the \nr.squaredGLMM function from the MuMIn package (Bartoń \n2019). The fit of the mixed-effect linear models with a ran-\ndom term (nest ID) was compared with the corresponding \nGLMs (without nest ID as a random term) using the anova  \nfunction. Cox regression analysis were performed with the \nFig. 1  Illustration of the meth-\nods used in the study\n\n8 G. Módra et al.\n1 3\nhelp of coxme function in coxme package (Therneau 2019). \nPost hoc sequential comparisons (Tukey HSD) among factor \nlevels when performing GLMM and Cox regression analy -\nsis were performed using emmeans function from emmeans \npackage (Russell 2019). The number of all combinations in \nthe randomization models were calculated using the CombN \nfunction, whereas the random combination of all the values \nwere gained by the Combset function in DescTools pack -\nage (Signorell et al. 2020). The values were picked up in a \nrandom manner with the vsetdiff function in vecsets package \n(Witthoft 2018).\nResults\nNumber of tools used\nWe have found one A. subterranea colony that proportion-\nally dropped (183) and retrieved (119) twice as many tools in \ntotal than the average  (meandropping: 93.8,  meanretrieving: 61.4), \nwhereas one colony dropped (48) and retrieved (27) about \nhalf of the average number of tools (Figs.  2, 3). However, \nthis latter (lowest) value was twice as high (dropping: 28, \nretrieving: 16) as the most elevated numbers found in Mes-\nsor colonies  (meandropping: 14;  meanretrieving: 6) (Figs. 2, 3).\nOverall, the workers of A.   subterranea dropped \nsignificantly more tools into honey-water baits than \nthose of M.  structor (GLMM z  = 9.33, p < 0.001). In \nM. structor, significantly fewer sand grains (z  = − 9.33, \np < 0.001), small soil grains (z  = − 8.45, p < 0.001) and \nlarge soil grains ( z = − 1.98, p = 0.047) were dropped \nas compared to A.  subterranea. In contrast, the workers \nof M. structor dropped significantly more pine needles \n(z = 2.58, p < 0.01). In the case of leaves and sponges there \nwere no significant differences between the two species \n(0.21 < z < 0.64, p > 0.526). The differences among colo-\nnies (nest ID) were responsible only for 4.052% of the \nvariation, although when removed, the difference between \nthe two models became significant (anova  Chi2 = 8.26, \np = 0.004). The marginal (the variance explained by the \nfixed effects) and conditional (variance explained by the \nentire model—both fixed and random effects) coefficient \nof determination for the model showed only slight differ -\nences (R 2\nmarg. = 0.377, R2\ncond. = 0.386).\nOverall, significantly more food-soaked tools were \nretrieved from baits by the workers of A. subterranea than \nthose of M.  structor ( z = 4.49, p < 0.001). In A. subterra-\nnea, significantly more sand grains (z  = 4.486, p < 0.001), \nsmall soil grains (z  = 8.433, p < 0.001), large soil grains \n(z = 4.943, p < 0.001) and sponges (z  = 2.058 p = 0.0396) \nwere retrieved than in M.  structor. In the case of pine \nneedles and leaves there were no significant differences \nbetween the two species (− 0.57 < z < 0.85, p > 0.395). \nThe differences among colonies (nest ID) were responsible \nfor 12.7% of the variation, and when removed, the differ -\nence between the two models became significant (anova \n Chi2 = 37.33, p < 0.001). The marginal (the variance \nexplained by the fixed effects) and conditional (variance \nexplained by the entire model—both fixed and random \neffects) coefficient of determination for the model showed \nonly slight differences (R 2\nmarg. = 0.872, R2\ncond. = 0.877).\nFig. 2  The number of different types of tools dropped into honey-\nwater baits by the workers of Aphaenogaster subterranea (black dots) \nand Messor structor (grey dots)\nFig. 3  The number of different types of tools retrieved from honey-\nwater baits by the workers of Aphaenogaster subterranea (black dots) \nand Messor structor (grey dots)\n9Comparison of foraging tool use in two species of myrmicine ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae)  \n1 3\nTool preference\nIn A.   subterranea, sand grains were the most \n(2.98 < z < 10.11, 0.001 < p < 0.035) and small soil grains \nthe second most frequently dropped tools (6.21 < z < 8.45, \np < 0.001) (Fig.  2). There were no significant differ -\nences among the rest of the tools (− 2.35 < z < 2.22, \np > 0.176). In M. structor, there was no significant differ -\nence in the number of different tools dropped into the baits \n(2.65 < z < 2.65, p > 0.086) (Fig. 2).\nDuring the retrieving of food-soaked tools, small soil \ngrains were the most frequently used tools by the workers \nof A. subterranea (5.32 < z < 9.65, p < 0.001) followed by \nthe large soil grains and sand grains (Fig. 3). However, there \nwas no significant difference between the two latter tools \n(z = 2.19, p = 0.240). There were also no significant differ -\nences among the rest of the tools (0.56 < z < 2.72, p > 0.071). \nContrary to A.  subterranea, the workers of M.  structor  \nshowed no preference for any tools (− 1.94 < z < 1.57, \np > 0.381) (Fig. 3). Sand grains were, however, retrieved \nin a significantly lower amount than any other tools \n(− 4.15 < z < -3.74, p < 0.01).\nRate of tool usage\nBased on the rate of tool dropping, the workers of A.  sub-\nterranea were significantly faster than those of M.  struc-\ntor ( z = 3.55, p < 0.001). In A. subterranea, sand grains \n(6.54 < z  < 12.85, p < 0.001) and small soil grains \n(8.26 < z < 9.89, p < 0.001) were dropped in a significantly \nfaster rate than the rest of the tools (Fig.  4). In M. structor, \nthere were no significant differences among the dropping \nrates of different tools (− 2.01 < z < 2.21, p > 0.231) (Fig. 5).\nWhen comparing the time span between the discovery of \nbaits and the beginning of tool dropping, and between the \nfirst dropping and retrieving event, the workers of A.  sub-\nterranea began both the dropping and retrieving of tools \nsignificantly earlier than those of M. structor (p < 0.001).\nDiscussion\nAlthough it has been known that the members of the gen -\nera Aphaenogaster and Messor can use tools to transport \nliquid food, no previous study has compared the tool-using \nbehavior of these two taxa. Despite the variation present \namong the colonies of both species, our results support the \nhypothesis that the omnivorous A. subterranea shows many \ndifferences in the nature of its tool-using behavior when \ncompared to M. structor, a mainly granivorous species. The \nforaging workers of A. subterranea dropped and retrieved \nsignificantly more tools into/from honey-water baits than \nthose of M. structor, and the preference for the use of certain \ntypes of tools also differed in the two species: A. subterranea \npreferred smaller tools over larger ones, while M. structor  \nshowed no preference towards any specific tools.  In addi-\ntion, there was a strong difference in the rate of tool usage \nbetween the two species, as tool dropping was significantly \nfaster in A. subterranea, and both the dropping and retriev -\ning of tools began significantly earlier than in M. structor.\nIn our study, the workers of A.   subterranea not just \ndropped and retrieved significantly more tools into/from \nhoney-water baits, but also showed a faster rate of tool \nusage than the workers of M.  structor. This may provide a \nselective advantage for these ants in interspecific competi-\ntion because, by using tools, they can utilize food sources \nbefore a dominant competitor can monopolize them.

The \nshaded areas represent ± 95% confidence intervals\n10 G. Módra et al.\n1 3\nwhen displaced from food sources, Aphaenogaster workers \ncan return at a later time and retrieve the food-soaked tools \nwhich are usually ignored by other species (Fellers and Fell-\ners 1976). Moreover, it was shown that other ants are less \nlikely to discover food sources that were previously covered \nwith tools (Fowler 1982; Banschbach et al. 2006; Lőrinczi \n2014). Beyond giving an edge in competition, this food hid-\ning behavior can also allow satiated colonies to store food \nfor later consumption (Banschbach et al. 2006; Qin et al. \n2019). Although the workers of M.  structor also retrieved \nsome food-soaked tools to the nests, this process was not \nas fluent and effective as was observed in the similar-sized \nA. subterranea colonies. By the end of the 5-h experiment, \nthe provided food source was fully utilized by the workers of \nA. subterranea, while in M. structor the majority of the food \nwas left behind. It seems that for seed-harvester ants like \nM. structor or M. barbarus it is not crucial to obtain liquids \nas fast as possible contrary to omnivorous species that uti -\nlize liquid food sources (e.g., honeydew) on a regular basis. \nDespite this, tool use may still have some adaptive value in \nseed-harvester ants, especially when, for example, local seed \nsources are not available but there are other opportunities to \nacquire food for the colony.\nThe tool-dropping workers of A.  subterranea preferred \nsand grains and small soil grains over larger tools, and they \ndropped these tools into honey-water baits significantly \nfaster than the rest of the tools. This result is consistent with \nother publications showing that the workers of A. subterra-\nnea use the most easily manageable tools during foraging, \nsupposedly to maximize the speed of the tool-using pro-\ncess (Maák et al. 2017 ; Lőrinczi et al. 2018; Módra et al. \n2020). The sizes of the most frequently used sand grains \n(ca. 0.5 mm in diameter) and small soil grains (ca. 1 mm in \ndiameter) are well in the range of the maximum mandible \ngap of A. subterranea workers (0.8–1.2 mm) (Oliveras et al. \n2005), allowing them to manipulate these tools easier and \nfaster than the larger ones. Contrary to the preference shown \ntowards sand grains during tool dropping, soil grains turned \nout to be the most frequently used tools when it came to \nretrieving. This result is consistent with recent studies show-\ning that the workers of A.  subterranea can optimize their \ntool use at two stages, first, when dropping tools, and sec-\nond, when retrieving food-soaked tools based on several fac-\ntors, such as the viscosity of the liquid food (Lőrinczi et al. \n2018). Contrary to A. subterranea, the workers of M. struc-\ntor showed no preference towards any specific tools neither \nduring dropping, nor during retrieving. Probably because of \nthe aforementioned reasons, effectiveness in tool dropping \nis not as significant for seed-harvester ants as for Aphaeno-\ngaster species.\nIn conclusion, the omnivorous A.  subterranea has more \nflexible and effective tool-using skills when foraging on \nliquid food than the granivorous M.  structor, whose tool-\nusing behavior appears to be less complex and vigorous. \nConsidering the high number of tool user species in the \nbasal myrmicine lineages, i.e., in the tribes Stenammini \nand Pogonomyrmecini, we can assume that there was a \ncommon tool user ancestor in the basal part of the subfam-\nily. The ability to use tools for foraging in Messor species \nthus seems to be a plesiomorphic character, which, after \nthe Middle Miocene (~ 16 mya) divergence of the gen-\nera Aphaenogaster and Messor (Ward et al. 2015), did \nnot disappear entirely in taxa specialized in feeding on \nseeds. A remnant behavior like this is not unique among \nanimals, for instance, although some whiptail lizards in \nthe Aspidoscelis genus reproduce by parthenogenesis, two \nfemales sometimes perform fake copulation which can be \nconsidered as the legacy of their bisexually reproducing \nancestors (Cole 1975). For seed-harvester ants, the ability \nto transport liquid food via tools may have lost its sig -\nnificance, but the possible benefits might have allowed \nthe behavior to be preserved on a certain level. Dropping \ntools into liquids may still be adaptive for these species as \na means to utilize liquid food sources if needed and also to \nserve as a means of getting rid of unwanted liquids close \nto the nest. The presence of such a behavioral remnant \nfurther demonstrates the diversity of the characteristics \nof foraging tool use in myrmicine ants, which poses sev -\neral intriguing questions that are yet to be answered. For \ninstance, it is still an open question whether the flexibility \nand effectiveness of the tool-using behavior of Aphaeno-\ngaster species can be considered widespread in the omniv -\norous tool user ant species or it is a unique characteristic \nof the members of this genus. More detailed surveys of \nthe nature of this behavior in members of other myrmicine \ngenera may help to answer this question, and the analysis \nof the distribution pattern of foraging tool use within the \nsubfamily will help to provide deeper insights into the \norigin and evolution of tool-using behavior in ants.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplemen-\ntary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s00040- 021- 00838-0.\nAuthor contributions GM, GL, and IM designed the experiment; GM, \nGL, IM, and ÁL carried out the experiments and data collection; IM \ncarried out the data analysis.
