As\nthe block rotates, the lengths of the arrows change in direct proportion to the magnitudes of the\ncorresponding stresses. If Mohr’s Circle is displayed, the two plotted points rotate around the circumference\nof the circle consistent with the orientation of the stress block. The animation will continue indefinitely, until\nmthe s~- button is clicked. By clicking the appropriate check boxes, the user may cause the\nanimation to pause at the maximum principal stresses (and maximum in-plane shear stress), or at any user-\nsupplied angle. (See Figure 2.) Numerical values of stresses are not displayed while the animation is in\nprogress, but appear whenever the motion of the stress block is stopped.

The ~SU#$LWSS  rhPWf8/ZIW  illustrates this concept more\nvividly than words or static pictures ever can.\nIn the classroom, the ~SU.l$4f!!SS rhlSf8/lllWis  run on a cart-mounted computer with a 33” color\nmonitor, clearly visible to all in the room.

It thus becomes the natural focal point for the instructor’s introductory remarks and\nconclusion, and a frequent point of reference for all of the critical teaching points noted above. It is also used\nto v~rify the solution of the example problems worked in class. Subsequently, the software is distributed to\nstudents for their own personal use, for verification of problem solutions and for self-paced study.\nThe author has found the ~SU.l$&4PSS  rrWSf@lZWto  be a simple yet effective learning aid for use in\nmechanics instruction. Its success has stimulated the development of a series of similar software products, all\nwritten in Visual Basic, and all intended to enhance students’ ability to visualize difficult concepts and\nphenomena.\nNote: The author will make the ~SU.lsrf@SS rhflSfO/RW available, at no cost, to all engineering educators\nwho wish to use it.
