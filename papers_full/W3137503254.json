  "abstract": "In this paper, the influence of the variation in transformer oil temperature on the accuracy of the all-acoustic non-iterative method for partial discharge location in a power transformer is researched. The research can improve power transformers’ testing and monitoring, particularly given the large transformer oil temperature variations during real-time monitoring. The research is based on quantifying the contribution of oil temperature to the standard combined measurement uncertainty of the non-iterative algorithm by using analytical, statistical, and Monte Carlo methods. The contribution can be quantified and controlled. The contribution varied significantly with different mutual placements of partial discharge and acoustic sensors. The correlation between the contribution and the mean distance between partial discharge and acoustic sensors was observed. Based on these findings, the procedure to quantify and control the contribution in practice was proposed. The procedure considers the specificity of the method’s mathematical model (the assumption that the oil temperature is constant), the non-iterative algorithm’s nonlinearity, and the large variations in transformer oil temperature. Existing studies did not consider the significant effect of the oil temperature on the combined measurement uncertainty of partial discharge location influenced by those phenomena. The research is limited to partial discharge located in the transformer oil.",
