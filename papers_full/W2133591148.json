To achieve compact circuit\narea and system-in-package (SiP) applications, the transformer\nstructure is integrated using integrated passive device (IPD)\ntechnology on a glass substrate.

INTRODUCTION\nThe recent trend in electronic products development is to simultane-\nously achieve light weight, thinness, high performance, high density\nintegration and low cost. Passive components play an important role\nReceived 17 December 2010, Accepted 19 January 2011, Scheduled 3 February 2011\nCorresponding author: Sung-Mao Wu (sungmao@nuk.edu.tw).\n252 Wu, Kuo, and Chen\nin the design and integration of the required systems. In the past, dis-\ncrete components were the norm for passive component such as those in\nsurface-mount device technology. However, discrete components take\nup too much space and increase cost. A better method is to imple-\nment a print circuit board (PCB) or other substrates, such as FR4,\nRT/duroid 6010LM Al2O3 ceramic substrate [1] and low-temperature\nco-ﬁred ceramic (LTCC) technology. Although this method improves\nperformance and shortens time intervals, limiting factors still include\narea reduction, design ﬂexibility for highdensity integration and cost.\nSystem on chip (SoC) is a proposed solution using many circuits inte-\ngrated in a chip with CMOS processing to reduce the circuit area and\nachieve high density integration. But the quality factor (Q) of passive\ncomponents remains a bottleneck for improvement.\nThe bandpass ﬁlter is an important component for the radio\nfrequency (RF)/microwave front-end systems, used to reject noise that\nwould interfere with signal transmission in a system. Most research on\nbandpass ﬁlter design uses PCBs. In [2], a conventional microstrip\nﬁlter was based primarily on transmission-line structures but occupied\na large area due to quarter- or half-wavelength resonator requirements.\nSome studies propose better solutions for reducing circuit size, such as\na stepped impedance resonator (SIR) [3–5], defected ground structure\n(DGS) resonator [6–8], patch-via-spiral resonator [9], or net-type\nresonator [10]. Unfortunately, these methods are still limited in design\nﬂexibility, quality factor, and cost. Diﬀerential circuits have become\nincreasingly important recently because of their noise rejection ability.\nBalanced bandpass ﬁlters (singleend input and diﬀerential output)\nand full diﬀerential bandpass ﬁlters (diﬀerential input and diﬀerential\noutput) have become popular research topics. Most of these studies\nhave used a microstrip line [11–13]. In [14], researchers used coupled-\nline sections and quarter-wavelength (λ/4) resonators to design a full\ndiﬀerential bandpass ﬁlter but its area still needs further reduction.\nA stepped-impedance resonator (SIR) is another proposed method for\nfull diﬀerential bandpass ﬁlter design [15]. A coupled-resonator and\nhalf-wavelength (λ/2) resonator were used in [16, 17], while a double-\nsided parallel-strip line (DSPSL) dual-mode resonator was proposed\nin [18]. However, area reduction in these studies was still limited.\nIntegrated passive device (IPD) technology on a glass substrate is an\nattractive solution to the foregoing problems. IPD features lower loss\nthan silicon substrate, highQ inductor, and good design ﬂexibility for\nintegration [19–22]. In IPD technology, many diﬀerent substrates were\nadopted for circuit design, such as silicon and glass. Passive devices\nwere almost integrated in silicon process based on SoC technology.\nUsually, inductors with lower quality factor were made on silicon\nProgress In Electromagnetics Research, Vol. 113, 2011 253\nsubstrate using thin-ﬁlm-metallization process. The substrate loss\non silicon and thin ﬁlm metallization decided the quality factor of\ninductors. So, glass IPD substrates used in this study are characterized\nby [21]:\n1) using thicker Cu metal for transformer design to reduce resistive\nloss; 2) using CVD-deposited SiNx as the dielectric layer of MIM\ncapacitors; and 3) because the substrate (dielectric) loss of glass\nsubstrate is smaller than that of silicon substrate, it can be used to\nimprove the quality factor.\nIt is also worth mentioning that IPD technology can easily\nbe integrated with system-in-package (SiP) applications, prompting\nextensive research on transformer-based structures in IPD technology,\nsuch as impedance transformation, balanced-to-unbalanced conversion\n(balun), power combining and coupling circuits [23, 24]. A very\ncompact transformer-coupled balun-integrated bandpass ﬁlter using\nIPD technology on glass substrate was presented in [25] reducing the\nbandpass ﬁlter area, providing coupling to the balanced output ports,\nand creating extra transmission zeros to enhance the desired stopband\nrejection. A cross-section of this glass IPD technology is presented in\nFig. 1. The circuit design is comprised of three metal layers: metal 3\nis thick copper for inductors design realizing the highQ transformers\nwhile metals 2 and 1 are thin copper (Cu) and gold (Au), respectively.\nA high-k (high dielectric constant) dielectric (SiNx) layer between\nmetals 1 and 2 allows metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitors to be\npart of the circuit design. A benzocyclobutene (BCB) layer provides\ncover and isolation.\n \nFigure 1. Cross-section of a glass IPD technology process.\nThis study presents a full diﬀerential bandpass ﬁlter extended\nfrom [25] using glass IPD technology for wireless local area network\n(WLAN) IEEE 802.11 b/g (2.4 GHz) applications. Using a planar\ntransformer with series capacitors to provide a magnetic-dominant\ncoupling of the coil-type resonators results in a very compact\nbandpass ﬁlters and increases design ﬂexibility. Using the proposed\n254 Wu, Kuo, and Chen\narchitecture a bandpass ﬁlter (single-end in and single-end out), a\nbalanced bandpass ﬁlter (single-end in, and diﬀerential out), and a\nfull diﬀerential bandpass ﬁlter (diﬀerential in and diﬀerential out)\ncould be designed at the same time. Comparison of simulated\nand measured results shows that the passband frequency shifts to\na high frequency because the supplied dielectric coeﬃcient (εr) is\nnot equal to the eﬀective dielectric constant (εeﬀ ), which will be\ndiscussed in the last section of this paper. Unlike other research\nthat has implemented PCBs or diﬀerent substrates, using the glass\nIPD technology can eﬀectively improve the circuit area without\naﬀecting circuit performance. The most important outcome is that\na full diﬀerential bandpass ﬁlter using glass IPD technology is easily\nintegrated with SiP applications [26–30] and enhances system design\nﬂexibility.\n2. COUPLED RESONATOR ANALYSIS\nThe structure and equivalent circuit of a coupled resonator is\nshown in Fig. 2. This structure consists of two parallel resonant\ncircuits (Resonator A and Resonator B) magnetically coupled with\na transformer mutual inductanceM. Each resonant circuit includes\na coil inductance (L1 − L2 − L1) resonated with a pair of dual\ncapacitors of capacitanceC achieved using a MIM capacitor. A mutual\ncapacitance Cc is used between the two resonant circuits, representing\nFigure 2. Equivalent circuit and physical layout of the coupled\nresonator in this study.\nProgress In Electromagnetics Research, Vol. 113, 2011 255\nthe parasitic electrical coupling between the two coil-type resonators.\nThe symmetric line of the structure in this study is evident in Fig. 2,\nwhere the outside ring is the ground for the resonant circuit. The\nplanar transformer is designed in an octagonal shape with the two\nparallel coils symmetrically interwoven side by side on metal 3. The\nred parallelogram shapes indicate coil underpasses, implemented on\nmetal 1. A pair of dual capacitors located at the top and bottom of\nFig. 2 uses metals 2 and 1. In this study, we applied magnetic coupling\nusing the coupled resonator synthesis method [31]. Our method of\nanalyzing the equivalent circuit will be explained in the following\nsection. Because this study is an extension of [25], we focus on the\nfull diﬀerential design and leave aside the design ﬂow of the bandpass\nﬁlter and balanced bandpass ﬁlter within this architecture.\n2.1. Single Resonator\nIn ﬁlter design, two important parameters for applying the above-\nmentioned method are the coupling coeﬃcient ( k) between two\nresonators and the external quality factor (Qe). Before describing\nthe extraction of these two parameters, we will ﬁrst analyze the\narchitecture of a single resonator. Fig. 3(a) shows the structure and\nequivalent circuit of a single resonator. By changing the tapped feed\nposition (Pt), the ratio betweenL1 and L2 can be determined. For a\nsingle resonator design, the resonant frequency is calculated by\nfs = 1\n2π\n√\n(L1 + L2)C\n(1)\nwhere fs is the resonant frequency. Fig. 4 shows the input impedance\nof a single resonator and a double resonator; using Equation (1), the\n(a) (b)\nFigure 3. Equivalent circuits and physical layout of (a) single\nresonator and (b) double resonator.\n256 Wu, Kuo, and Chen\n \nFigure 4. Input impedance of\nsingle and double resonators.\nFigure 5. Calculated external\nquality factors of resonators ver-\nsus tapped feed position.\nresonant frequency can be calculated. In addition, the position of the\ntransmission zero, which is located between 3 GHz and 4 GHz, relates\nto L1 and C.\nThe Qe of a single resonator can be evaluated as a function of the\ntapped feed position. It is often measured in terms of the normalized\ninput admittance (yin) and the group delay (τΓ) with respect to the\nreﬂection coeﬃcient at the resonant angular frequencyω [31]. That is,\nQe = ω0τT (ω0)\n4\n[\n1 − y2\nin(ω0)\n]\n(2)\nwhere yin can be obtained from the reﬂection coeﬃcient, andτΓ can be\nfound in its phase with respect to angular frequency. Fig. 5 shows the\nrelationship between the tapped feed position andQe, which expresses\nwhether or not there is impedance matching between the bandpass\nﬁlter and the external circuit.\n2.2. Double Resonator\nTo reduce the level of common-mode noise while achieving the\ndesired passband response in diﬀerential-mode operation, a symmetric\nstructure is adopted. The structure and equivalent circuit of a\ndouble resonator are shown in Fig. 3(b). It consists of inductance\n(L1 − L2 − L3 − L4) resonated with a pair of dual capacitors of\ncapacitance C. For the purpose of the symmetric structure, we let\nL1 = L4, L2 = L3, andC1 = C2. The input impedance of the double\nresonator is presented in Fig. 4, and its resonant frequency is also\ndetermined using Equation (1). Two transmission zeros are located at\n1.9 GHz and 3.9 GHz, respectively. The transmission zero at the higher\nProgress In Electromagnetics Research, Vol. 113, 2011 257\nfrequency is dominated by input inductance and capacitance (L1 and\nC1), while the other transmission zero is determined byL2, L3, L4, and\nC2. The extraction method forQe is the same as for single resonator.\nUsing Equation (2), the tapped feed position versusQe is given in\nFig. 5. It is clear that theQe of the double resonator approximately\ndoubles that of the single resonator.\n2.3. Extraction k\nThe other important parameter in a coupled-resonator ﬁlter design is\nthe coupling coeﬃcient (k) between the two resonators. The intensity\nof coupling, which dominates the bandwidth of the bandpass ﬁlter,\ndepends on the spacing between the intertwined turns of the coils in the\ntransformer (Sc, shows in Fig. 3(b)). According to [31], the coupling\ncoeﬃcient relating the two dominant resonant frequenciesf1 and f2\ncan be calculated as follows:\nk = ±f2\n2 − f2\n1\nf2\n2 + f2\n1\n(3)\nVariation in the coupling coeﬃcient depends on the spacing and\nexpresses how the spacing of coil inductance aﬀects the coupling\nintensity.\n3. FULL DIFFERENTIAL BANDPASS FILTER USING\nCOUPLED RESONATOR\n3.1. Filter Structure\nThe proposed full diﬀerential bandpass ﬁlter shown in Fig. 6 is\ncomposed of two symmetric resonators, based on the work in [25]. To\ncreate the symmetric structure, the proposed ﬁlter was integrated using\na planar transformer with series capacitors. The target of reducing the\ncircuit area and the level of common-mode noise while achieving the\ndesired passband response in diﬀerential-mode operation was thereby\nrealized.\nThe proposed full diﬀerential bandpass ﬁlter in Fig. 7 was\nimplemented using an integrated transformer fabricated on glass IPD\ntechnology (glass substrate thickness = 200µm, dielectric constant\n(SiNx) = 7.2, loss tangent = 0.0065, dielectric constant (BCB) = 2.7),\nas shown in Fig. 1. In the process of designing this bandpass ﬁlter, a\nfull wave simulation Ansoft HFSSTM was used. For the convenience\nof 4-port measurement, a tapped feed trace was adjusted in four\ndirections (east, west, south, and north). An Agilent ENA network\nanalyzer and a Cascade probe (ACP-40-GSG, pitch 150µm) were used\n258 Wu, Kuo, and Chen\nLength(mm) Length(mm) \nW1 0.04 a2 0.326 \nW2 0.1 a3 0.43 \nG1 0.175 a4 0.33 \nG2 0.175 a5 0.05 \nPt 0.21 a6 = a7 1.27 \nSc 0.03 a8 0.39 \na1 0.075 a9 0.36 \nFigure 6.

The 4-port S-parameters for simulation\nand measurement were deduced using mixed-modeS-parameters, as\nper [32].\n3.2. Design Procedure\nA second-order 0.1 dB equal-ripple Chebyshev response bandpass ﬁlter\nwas designed with a center frequency of 2.45 GHz and a fractional\nbandwidth ∆ of 15%. The unload quality factor (Qu) of a coil-type\nresonator is 22, and the corresponding element values of the prototype\nare g = 1, g1 = 0.843, g2 = 0.622, and g3 = 1.355. To determine\nthe turn spacing of the coil and the tapped feed position of the full\ndiﬀerential bandpass ﬁlter, the coupling coeﬃcients at diﬀerential-\nProgress In Electromagnetics Research, Vol. 113, 2011 259\nmode operation (kdd\n12) and the external quality factors (Qdd\ne ) of the\nsecond-order ﬁlter prototype elements need to be calculated from [31].\nThese relations are given as:\nkdd\n12 = ∆√g1g2\n= 0.21 (4)\nQdd\ne = g0g1\n∆ = g2g3\n∆ = 5.6 (5)\nwhere ∆ is the fractional bandwidth, and gi is the ith prototype\nelement value. In addition, for a second-order equal-ripple Chebyshev\nbandpass ﬁlter design, the insertion loss at the passband can be\nestimated by the formula given in [31], reproduced below:\nILω0(dB) ≈ 4.343\n∆ · Qu\n(g1 + g2) = 1.92 (6)\nAccording to the above-described design procedure, the full diﬀerential\nbandpass ﬁlter corresponds with the design speciﬁcations.\n3.3. Diﬀerential Mode Response\nFigures 8(a) and 8(b) show comparisons between measured and\nsimulated diﬀerential-mode responses of the proposed full diﬀerential\nbandpass ﬁlter in Fig. 6. The measured passband frequency is 2.9 GHz.\nThe minimum insertion loss (Sdd\n21 ) and return loss (Sdd\n11 ) are 3.47 dB and\n7.2 dB, respectively. The fabricated full diﬀerential bandpass ﬁlter has\na size of 1.27 mm× 1.27 mm, and the transmission zero is created at\n4 GHz.\n(a) return Loss (b) insertion Loss\nFigure 8.Measured and simulated diﬀerential-mode responses for the\nproposed full diﬀerential bandpass ﬁlter.\n260 Wu, Kuo, and Chen\nFrom the comparison, it is evident that the measurement passband\nfrequency shifts from 2.45 GHz to 2.9 GHz, and the transmission\nzero shifts from 3.57 GHz to 4 GHz. The reason for this frequency\nshift is that the supplied dielectric coeﬃcient (εr) from IC foundry\nservices is not the eﬀective dielectric constant (εeﬀ ) within the circuit\ndesign. However, appropriately adjusting the dielectric coeﬃcient of\nthe simulated parameter improves the results.\n3.4. Common Mode Response\nFigure 9(a) presents a comparison between measured and simulated\ncommon-mode responses of the proposed full diﬀerential bandpass ﬁlter\nin Fig. 6. The measured common-mode response is suppressed below\n−25 dB up to 8 GHz. As suggested by [33], the common-mode rejection\nratio (CMRR) deﬁned by\nCMRR = 20· log |sdd\n21|\n|scc\n21| (dB) (7)\nwas adopted as the performance measure for the level of common-mode\nsuppression around the full diﬀerential bandpass ﬁlter. The CMRR of\nthe proposed bandpass ﬁlter is presented in Fig. 9(b). The maximum\nCMRR is 28.4 dB at 2.9 GHz, with all the CMRR values above 25 dB\nranging from 2.45 GHz to 3.29 GHz.\nIn Table 1, the full diﬀerential bandpass ﬁlter realized in this\nstudy is summarized and compared with other studies. Note that the\ndimension of the present bandpass ﬁlter is much smaller than in other\nstudies.

The most important fact is that the ﬁlter design\nfabricated on glass IPD technology is easily integrated with the CMOS\nprocess, achieving the target of being usable in SiP applications.\n4. DISCUSSION\nThe proposed full diﬀerential bandpass ﬁlter still has some ﬂaws to\nbe addressed. As indicated in the previous section, the shift in\nmeasurement passband frequency and the mismatch caused by diﬀerent\ntapped feed position need to be adjusted. A discussion of these ﬂaws\nfollows.\n4.1. Frequency Shifting\nFrom the measurement results, it is clear that the passband frequency\nshifts to a high frequency. The speculated reason is that the supplied\ndielectric coeﬃcient (εr) is not equal to the eﬀective dielectric constant\n(εeﬀ ). To verify this inference, the εr of the high-k dielectric was\nadjusted from 7.2 to 5.39. The inferential result was realized using\nAnsoft HFSSTM simulator.\nFigures 10(a) and (b) and Fig. 11(a) show diﬀerential-\nmode response and common-mode response, respectively, comparing\nmeasured and simulated modiﬁed dielectric constants. Fig. 11(b)\ncompares CMRR results.

Modiﬁed εr and measured comparison of common-mode\nresponse for proposed full diﬀerential bandpass ﬁlter.\nalmost overlap could be proof that the passband frequency shift is\ncaused by the eﬀective dielectric constant.\n4.2. Tapped Feed Position\nFrom the above comparison between simulated and measured results,\nit is evident that the tapped feed position is incorrect, resulting in\nthe response not corresponding with the design speciﬁcation. In other\nwords, the return loss of the diﬀerential-mode response for the second-\norder 0.1 dB equal-ripple Chebyshev response design should have\nexhibited two reﬂection zeros. For this reason, the tapped feed position\nneeded to be adjusted again. In addition, to conveniently conduct 4-\nport measurement with a Cascade probe (ACP-40-GSG, pitch 150µm),\nProgress In Electromagnetics Research, Vol. 113, 2011 263\nthe measurement traces were turned in four directions (east, west,\nsouth, and north), as shown in Fig. 7. To improve the CMRR of\nthe proposed bandpass ﬁlter and simultaneously adjust the tapped\nfeed position, direct diﬀerential measurement with the cascade probe\n(ACP-40-GSGSG, pitch 150µm) was adopted (Fig. 12). Fabrication\nof the adjusted full diﬀerential bandpass ﬁlter is now being carried\nout by the National Chip Implementation Center (CIC), Taiwan,\nwhich provides the IC foundry services. Follow-up measurements will\nbe presented after fabrication is complete. Figs. 13 and 14 show\nthe diﬀerential-mode and common-mode responses, respectively. The\nminimum insertion loss (Sdd\n21 ) is 1.5 dB, and the return loss (Sdd\n11 ) is\n11.9 dB. Up to 8 GHz the common-mode response is suppressed below\n30 dB. The CMRR in particular, shown in Fig. 15, improves up to and\nbeyond 30 dB.\nFigure 12.

CONCLUSION\nIn this study, a very compact full diﬀerential bandpass ﬁlter using\nglass IPD technology has been presented. The ﬁlter eﬀectively reduced\ncircuit area improved the quality factor of passive components and\nwas easily integrated for SiP applications Although process variation\nand an incorrect tapped feed position aﬀected circuit performance,\nhigh density integration and application were achievable after slight\nadjustments. Generally, the proposed full diﬀerential bandpass ﬁlter\nexhibits the following attractive features. First, its area (1.27 mm×\n1.27 mm) is much smaller than others in the literature. Second, the\ncenter frequency in this study (2.45 GHz) is commonly bands for\nwireless communication bands. Third, performance, as gauged by\ninsertion loss (2.5 dB) and CMRR (> 30 dB), is still acceptable for\nsuch a compact area. Last, the proposed bandpass ﬁlter, as others\nimplemented on glass IPD technology, is proven to be suitable for SiP\napplications. This proposed full diﬀerential bandpass ﬁlter will be\neasily integrated to enhance system design ﬂexibility.\nREFERENCES\n1. Kung, C.-Y., Y.-C. Chen, S.-M. Wu, C.-F. Yang, and J.-S.
