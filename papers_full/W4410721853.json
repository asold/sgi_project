    "abstract": "The accelerated digitization of documentation, including paper invoices and receipts, has mitigated the necessity for precise and expeditious information management. Nevertheless, it has become unfeasible for humans to manually capture data due to the laborious and time-consuming nature of the process. The paper proposed a low training cost, prompt-based applied key information extraction (applied KIE) pipeline of the information extraction approach with Amazon Textract and Automatic Prompt Engineer (APE) using large language models (LLMs). A series of experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, with the results indicating an average precision of 95.5% and document information extraction accuracy of 91.5% on the SROIE (a widely used English dataset), and an average precision of 97.15% and a document information extraction accuracy of 85.29% on the invoice dataset from a Taiwanese shipping company.",
