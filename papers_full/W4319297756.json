  "abstract": "A transformer is an important part of the power system. Existing transformer fault diagnosis methods are still limited by the accuracy and efficiency of the solution and excessively rely on manpower. In this paper, a novel neural network is designed to overcome this issue. Based on the traditional method of judging the ratio of dissolved gas in transformer internal insulation oil, a fast fault diagnosis model of a transformer was built with an improved probabilistic neural network (PNN). The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was used to find the global optimal smoothing factor and improve the fault diagnosis accuracy of PNN. The transformer fault diagnosis model based on improved PNN not only eliminates the influence of human subjective factors but also significantly improves the diagnosis speed and accuracy, meeting the requirements for real-time application in practical projects. The feasibility and effectiveness of the method proposed in this paper are illustrated by a case study of actual data. Through analysis and comparison, the diagnostic accuracy of the proposed method is 10% higher than that of the general BPNN and 5% higher than that of the traditional PNN on the premise of ensuring the efficiency of the solution.",
