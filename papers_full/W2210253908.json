This technique allows\nthermolabile and high-molecular-weight compounds, such as\nbiopolymers and proteins, to be ionized and transferred to the\ngas phase, thus developing new applications in molecular\nbiology, medicine and plant metabolomics.\n1–3 The inuence\nof ESI in chemistry was recognized in 2002 when John B.

Initially, the analyte is infused into the ESI\nsource for the charge generation (Fig. 1A); here, protonated/\ndeprotonated molecules can be produced by Br¨onsted–Lowry\nacid–base reactions (protonation/deprotonation) and/orvia the\nLewis acid–base mechanism (adduct formation by interactions\nbetween cations or anions with neutral molecules). These“even\nelectron ions” (EE\n+ or EE/C0 ) (Fig. 1B) typically display low\ninternal energy content; consequently, little or no fragmenta-\ntion is oen observed in a MS spectrum of these ions.\n2 The\nradical ions (“odd electron ions” or OEc+) produced by electron\nionization (EI) have much more internal energy, and their\nfragment ions can be seen in a MS spectrum.\n2 Exceptions have\nbeen extensively described in the ESI source by the loss of one\nelectron for some characteristic compounds, a ﬀording odd\nelectron ions, which are called molecular ions (Fig. 1B).\n5 The\nmolecular ion formation is more prone to occur in positive\nmode than radical anion formation in negative mode.\n6–9\nConsidering all the ionization possibilities presented in Fig. 1B\nDaniel Pecoraro Demarque ob-\ntained a B.Sc. degree and a M.Sc.\ndegree in Pharmacy at the\nFederal University of Mato\nGrosso do Sul dealing with che-\nmometric design strategies to\noptimization and technological\ndevelopment of vegetable\nextracts.

A collision cell (or other related MS\ncomponent) generates a MS\n2 (or MS/MS) spectrum, and the\nfragmented ions generated are detected in the second mass\nanalyser. These fragments can be used for structure elucidation\npurposes. To achieve a better understanding of the reactions that\nmay occur under collision-induced dissociation conditions,\na brief explanation and comparison between their operational\nparameters are provided because it is possible to have the\nsame fragmentation reactions using a variety of activation\nmethods.\nIn tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), ions generated by\nESI can be selected in the rst stage of MS to collide with\nmolecules of an inert collision gas (Fig. 1D).\n10 This step is very\nfast (between 10/C0 14 to 10/C0 16 s) and leads to an increase in the\nion's internal energy, promoting it to an excited state.11 Imme-\ndiately aer the ion excitation, the unimolecular decomposition\nis initiated and, as result, the activated selected ions (the\nprecursor ions) are converted into fragment ions (product ions)\nin a collision energy-dependent manner following three major\nclasses of reactions (Fig. 1C).\n4,10,12 The fragmentation of odd\nelectron ions (molecular ions) are well described in several\nimportant textbooks about electron ionization (EI-MS), such as\nthe McLaﬀerty compendium; therefore, it is not discussed in\nFig. 1 Representative overview of MS/MS spectra results.

Depending of the ion type ((Mc+), [M + H]+, [M + metal]+,[ M/C0 H]/C0 ,[ M/C0 Cl]/C0 ), after passing to the collision\ncell, they may follow classical EI reactions, charge migration fragmentations or charge retention fragmentations (C) (negative radical anions may\noccur in speciﬁc cases and are not represented). Diﬀerent collision cells (E), diﬀerent collision gases and diﬀerent collision energies (D) generate\ndiﬀerent spectra, as shown in the comparison of irinotecan (1) in CID and HCD and budlein A (2) in CID-QqQ and CID-TOF (E). An example of the\ninﬂuence of diﬀerent collision energies can be seen in the fragmentation of 2,3-dihydroxycinnamic acid in positive mode.\n434 | Nat. Prod.

Cationized molecules (and other related\nspecies) normally fragment following charge retention frag-\nmentation reactions. There are few examples of charge-migra-\ntion fragmentations, most of them restricted to sulfate and\nphosphate compounds.\n14,15 However, the restriction of a major\ngroup of fragmentation reactions for cationized species does\nnot indicate that more structure information can be achieved\nfrom protonated species (by the possible occurrence of both\ngroups of reactions). For some classes of compounds, especially\nionophores (polyketide antibiotics), the fragmentation reac-\ntions of sodiated species are much more informative than those\nof its protonated molecules.\n16 Knowledge about the precursor\nion structure and its fragmentation reactions plays a key role in\nthe structure elucidation of natural and synthetic compounds\nbased only on ESI-MS/MS. Finally, Fig. 1D shows three examples\nof gases that are typically used in collisional activation,\nproviding additional relevant information. As expected when\nsetting up the instrument conditions, the eﬃciency to transfer\nthe energy must be diﬀerent for each gas, according to the law\nof conservation of momentum.\n11 Thus, the applied collision gas\nmust be considered for a comparative analysis of MS/MS spectra\nbecause diﬀerent gases can cause diﬀerences in the ion inten-\nsities in the MS/MS spectrum.\nAnother important piece of information to be used for\na reliable analysis by mass spectrometry is the type of mass\nanalyser used in tandem mass spectrometry. MS/MS spectra can\ngain information about aspects of the fragmentation processes\nthat occur by using diﬀerent mass spectrometers (Fig. 1E).\nThus, the conducted experiments using analysers such as Triple\nQuadrupole (QqQ), Quadrupole-Time of Flight (QTOF), Ion\nTrap (IT), Orbitraps, Fourier Transform Mass Spectrometry\n(FTMS), and Higher Energy Collisional Dissociation (HCD)\nfragmentation from trap analysers can induce less fragmenta-\ntion ions.\n17–21\nThe energy involved during the dissociation process can be\nused to support the formation suggestion for the most specic\nions. Experiments using di ﬀerent activation methods, i.e.,\nconventional low-energy CID, electron capture dissociation\n(ECD) and electron transfer dissociation (ETD), or diﬀerent\nanalysers, i.e., sequential or tandem mass spectrometers, can\nresult in the observation of diﬀerent ions in the MS/MS or MSn\nspectra.\nThe delay between the collision and the fragment detection\ndetermines the intensity of the ions and provides a character-\nistic spectrum. The formation of metastable ions (ions formed\nin the source that are decomposed before detection),\n22 rear-\nrangements, proton migration and other mechanisms can\noccur during the time-scale of the experiments. It is important\nto observe that long-time analysers may show a diﬀerence in the\nfragmentation behaviours compared with fast procedures. This\nmay be due to the competition of kinetic and thermodynamic\nfactors; thus, the most stable ion is occasionally not the most\nintense ion (in fast procedures), probably because several initial\nfragmentation reactions were required to aﬀord it. The combi-\nnation between energy-resolved plotting, survival-yield methods\nand computational calculations of fragmentation barriers is an\nimportant tool to characterize some fragmentation processes\nand non-homogeneous fragmentation behaviours in ESI-MS/\nMS. However, these studies require time, computational cost\nand accurate structural characterization. The use of the\nconcepts of reactivity and ion stability can also be important to\npropose fragmentation mechanisms based on the main frag-\nmentation reactions, as will be discussed in this article.\nOther activation methods can eventually be used to provide\nstructure information in addition to that obtained from ESI-CID.\nFor example, the recently published results using natural prod-\nucts were evaluated in studies with the isomers of budlein A (2)\nand centratherin by Sartori and co-workers,\n21 showing that HCD\nelicits complementary fragmentation pathways in addition to the\nCID available in Q-TOF and QqQ; indeed, it produces diagnostic\nions in the MS/MS spectra that aid the elucidation of metabolite\nstructure. Illustrative schematic spectra are presented in Fig. 1E.\nHCD can improve the fragmentation in the low mass region, as\nobserved in CID using QqQ. Thus, HCD would be a complemen-\ntary source for elucidation and characterization. Fig. 1E displays\ntwo studies using CID (QqQ and QTOF) and HCD (Orbitrap). The\nsame eﬀect can be observed for irinotecan (1) fragmentation in\nCID and HCD (Fig. 1E). Finally, trap machines sometimes can\nhave a blind zone that is approximately 15% of the total mass.\nThe classical method used to identify microcystin in ESI (positive\nmode) is the observation of the side-chain cleavages with the\nelimination of Adda moieties.\n23,24 This key fragment typically\noccurs in positive mode at 135 mass units; however, for micro-\ncystin with a mass of over than 1000 mass units, sometimes it is\nnot possible to observe this key ion in trap machines, which can\nlead to an incorrect interpretation for inexperienced users. Thus,\nit is important to realise that diﬀerent analysers can show\ndiﬀerent results for the same molecule, and use the correct\nstrategy to have the maximum results.\nAlthough diﬀerent fragments can be seen according to the\ncollision cell type and mass analyser, the reactions compiled\nin this work can be observed in all collisional cells coupled to\nESI sources with diﬀerent analysers. It is also important to\nnote that the fragmentations described in this review were\nselected to display a protocol for possible fragmentation that\noccurs in mass spectrometry analysis of natural and synthetic\ncompounds.\n2 Fragmentation reactions\nrationalization for structural\nelucidation\nUnderstanding the fragmentation reactions of the precursor ion\nis essential for the structural characterization of organic\ncompounds using ESI-CID-MS/MS data.

For\nstudies with natural and synthetic products, however, the\noverall system must be considered, so that the mechanism\ninvolved cannot be suggested based solely on the functional\ngroups.\nIn the structure elucidation process based on ESI-MS/MS\ndata, the knowledge of the fragmentation reactions involved in\nthe formation of the peaks of the mass spectrum may provide\nimportant information about the molecular structure and the\nconnectivity between the atoms. Isomer diﬀerentiation can be\nperformed using this technique, demonstrating its potential\nand utility as a structure elucidation tool.\n27,28\nAlthough there is an increasing number of studies reporting\nproposed fragmentations, the lack of a systematic compilation\nhas led to errors in mechanism determinations. Eﬀorts have\nbeen focused on dening the most important terms used in\nmass spectrometry; however, compilations that include the\nmajor fragmentation reaction classes remain scarce.\n22 The use\nof the pioneers' reference materials is extremely valuable for the\ninterpretation of the data collected here.\nWhen performing the rationalization of a fragmentation\npathway, it is important to remember that the proposed frag-\nmentation processes must be basedon organic chemistry princi-\nples. In the scientic literature, inadequate arrow representations,\nsuch as those shown in Fig. 2, can be extensively observed. Two\ndiﬀerent curved arrow systems are available to represent the\nelectron movement in the mechanism of retro-heteroene reactions\n(Fig. 4.3 and Section 5.4). However, considering that the highest\nelectron density is at the X atom, the representation shown in\nFig. 2a is the most appropriate; the representation in Fig. 2b is not\nrecommended because it depicts the electrons moving towards\nthe heteroatom, which is highly unlikely.\nOther mechanisms can lead to misunderstandings when\nisobaric fragment ions are generated ( e.g., ions displaying\nidentical m/z values). Fig. 3 shows two possible mechanisms\nleading to the same fragments: McLaﬀerty-type rearrangements\nand remote hydrogen rearrangements. The energetically most\nfavoured process under CID conditions will depend on the\nchemical structure. For example, them/z 173 fragment ion of\ndeprotonated dicaﬀeoylquinic acid (3) can result from a remote\nhydrogen rearrangement fromm/z 191 (route a, Fig. 3, fragment\n(3.2)).\n29 Alternatively, an isomeric fragment ion can be formed\ndirectly from the precursor ion by a McLaﬀerty-type rearrange-\nment (route b, Fig. 3, fragment ( 3.1)). Although the six-\nmembered transition state involved in the McLa ﬀerty-type\nrearrangement (route a) is lower in energy than that in the four-\ncentred transition state of remote hydrogen rearrangements\n(route b), the formation of the m/z 173 (3.3) fragment ion\nthrough route a is favoured because the process is driven by the\nformation of a double bond conjugated with the carbonyl\ngroup. Therefore, the basic organic chemistry concepts must be\nconsidered not only to establish the fragmentation pathways\nbut also to choose the most likely one.\nTo contribute to a rationalization of the fragmentation\nprocess, this review article aims to systematize the gas-phase\nfragmentation reactions of organic micromolecules (with\na molecular mass of less than 5.000 u). For this purpose, the\ngas-phase fragmentation reactions were systematically divided,\nand examples from the literature are provided.\nHere, the fragmentation reactions were divided into two main\ngroups: charge retention fragmentations (CRF) and charge-\nmigration fragmentations (CMF). The terminology used illus-\ntrates the hypothetical even electron ions ABCDE\n+ or ABCDE/C0 ,\nwhere the letters represent an atom, a functional group, or even\nseveral groups, such as an alkyl chain. This terminology is similar\nto that adopted by Fred W. McLaﬀerty, which classies the gas-\nphase fragmentation reactions of ions generated by electron\nionization (EI) and chemical ionization (CI).\n13\n3 Charge retention fragmentations\n(CRF)\nCharge retention fragmentations (CRF) are composed of a class\nof reactions that results in fragment ions with the charge\nlocated at the site identical to its precursor ion.

This mechanism involves an intra-\nmolecular 1,2-elimination (or intramolecular b-elimination)\nwith the consequent formation of a newp bond in the detected\nfragment ion (Fig. 4.1a) or in the eliminated neutral molecule\n(Fig. 4.1b).\nThe second general reaction presented in Fig. 4.2 involves\na simultaneous reorganization of bondsvia a cyclic transition\nstate. This type of reaction is called a “pericyclic reaction”\nFig. 4 General mechanism of charge retention fragmentations (CRF) (CS* ¼ charge site, which can be a positive or a negative charge).\nThis journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016 Nat.

Cycles\ncontaining a double bond can fragmentvia retro-Diels–Alder\n(RDA) fragmentation reactions in which a six-membered ring\ncontaining the double bond fragments undergoes a pericyclic\nmechanism to yield a diene and a dienophile in a process that is\nthe reverse of the Diels–Alder reaction.\nThe stereospecicity and the concerted nature of the gas-\nphase RDA fragmentation mechanism were investigated by\nDenekamp and co-workers.\n33 The authors reported that cis-\nfused bicyclic systems aﬀorded only cis-double bonds in the\ncharged or neutral cyclic product, originating from the non-\ncyclohexene portion of the precursor (the original dienophile)\n(Fig. 5a). However, the expected formation of thetrans double\nbond in the charged or neutral cyclic compound fromtrans-\nfused bicyclic systems, originating from the non-cyclohexane\nportion of the precursor (the original dienophile), does not\noccur because of the high energy requirements of atrans double\nbond in small-sized rings (Fig. 5b). These results corroborated\nthe concerted nature of RDA fragmentations and the involve-\nment of a favourable six-membered transition state. However,\nthe authors also found that for select compounds, the RDA\nreactions occurred with partial stereospeci city or with no\nstereospecicity. They concluded that the nature of the RDA\nfragmentation reactions is strongly dependent on the structure\nof the precursor ion.\nFig. 4.3 presents the retro-ene fragmentation reactions,\nwhich involve a transfer of a g-hydrogen to an unsaturated\ncarbon via a six-membered transition state to yield both ene and\nenophil as fragments. In most cases, these reactions proceedvia\na concerted mechanism.\n34 Retro-heteroene fragmentation\nreactions (Fig. 4.4) are similar to retro-ene reactions but diﬀer in\nthat an X–H bond (where X is a heteroatom, usually oxygen) is\nformed instead of a C–H bond.\nFig. 4.5 shows a general fragmentation mechanism called\n“charge remote fragmentation”. Although this term has been\nused to refer to every reaction occurring away from the charge\nsite, in this review article, this term was used to describe a class\nof charge-retention fragmentation reactions that involves a six-\nmembered cyclic transition state and leads to the elimination of\nH\n2 and an olen (as rst described by Adams and Gross\n(1986)).35–37\nAnother CRF explored in this review is a fragmentation\nreaction that requires at least four conjugated double bonds\nand a relative conformational mobility for its occurrence\n(Fig. 4.6). This reaction leads to aromatic ring eliminations from\npolyene systems; thus, it is named aromatic eliminations.\nConsidering that the energy barrier for the isomerization of the\ndouble bonds is relatively low, polyenes ionized by ESI can\nassume the conformation required for this reaction under CID\nconditions so that a disrotatory ring-closure allowed by orbital\nsymmetry occurs.\n38,39 Subsequently, a pericyclic reaction will\nrealize a six-membered ring. Coughlan and co-workers showed\nthat this mechanism occurred using theoretical calculations.\n40\nIn addition to retro-Diels–Alder (RDA), retro-ene and retro-\nheteroene reactions, a non-classic pericyclic cycloreversion\nprocess involving cyclohexane rings has also been reported under\nCID conditions. In this concerted process, threes-bonds are\nbroken, and three new p-bonds are formed, resulting in\nthe opening of the six-membered ring (Fig. 4.7a). However,\ncycloreversion in compounds possessing a cyclohexane ring in\ntheir structures is not a classical cycloreversion process because\nno synthetic procedures based on the simultaneous use of\nthree alkenes to produce a cyclohexane were found. However, the\nsimultaneous elimination of H\n2O and two alkenes (for alcohols\nwith more than 4Cs) through a six-membered transition state\nsimilar to that involved in the cycloreversion reactions in cyclo-\nhexane are well described in electron ionization processes.\n41\nThe sigmatropic rearrangements are pericyclic processes in\nwhich a bond is broken while another bond is formed across\na p-system (Fig. 4.7b and c). In summary, an atom (or a group of\natoms) s-bonded to a carbon may rearrange its position\nthrough one or morep-electron systems.42 Although this reac-\ntion has been reported to occur in ESI-CID experiments, it does\nnot produce any fragment ion because the total number ofs-\nbonds and p-bonds in the identical structure is maintained.\nHowever, this process can produce more stable ions or lead to\na reorganization of the system to favour subsequent fragmen-\ntation processes.\nA common fragmentation involving carbonyl compounds is\nthe CO elimination from cyclic carbonyl compounds. In prin-\nciple, two mechanisms are possible for this type of CO elimi-\nnation. Therst one (Fig. 4.8a) is a single-step mechanism that\ninvolves simultaneous (concerted) bond breaking and bond\nmaking events. This mechanism is the most oen cited in the\nliterature, notably for cyclic ketones. A second possible mech-\nanism involves an equilibrium between the cyclic and ring-\nopened structures, followed by an internal attack (Fig. 4.8b).\nHowever, there is no theoretical evidence to support this\nmechanism to date.\nAs previously discussed, select molecules can lose one elec-\ntron under ESI conditions, producing molecular ions (odd-\nelectron ions).\n43 In addition, for select compounds, their even-\nelectron ions generated in the ESI source can also produce\nradical cations (odd-electron ions) by homolytic cleavage under\nCID conditions. The fragmentation of radical species depends\non the charge and radical site, which is important for the\ninitiation of the proposed mechanism. Ions that exhibit sepa-\nration between charge site and radical site are labelled as dis-\ntonic ions (ions containing radical and ionic charges in\ndiﬀerent atoms in the same molecule). Fig. 4.9 shows the\nmechanism for radical fragmentation.\nFig. 5 RDA fragmentation in smallcis- andtrans-fused bicyclic rings.\n438 | Nat. Prod.

In general, CRF gas-phase reactions\nof negative ions are similar to those of positive ions because they\noccur in positions remote from the charge site. However, CMF in\nnegative ions signicantly diﬀer from those of positive ions. In\npositive ions, CMF reactions usually eliminate a leaving group for\nwhich the charge site was initially the location of a neutral mole-\ncule. However, the neutral loss from negative ions typically occurs\nat the part of the ion structure thatwas initially charged (Fig. 6). In\nthis review, the charge-migration fragmentation of positive and\nnegative ions is discussed separately.\n4.1 CMF for positive ions\nThe rst fragmentation reaction presented in the CMF section\nfor positive ions is a simple inductive cleavage involving the\nheterolysis of a B–C bond in which AB bears the positive charge\n(Fig. 7.1.1). The mechanism of this gas-phase fragmentation\nreaction is similar to the ionization step of E\n1 and SN1 mecha-\nnisms; however, in this case, the solvent stabilizing eﬀect on the\nresulting fragment ion does not exist. For this reason, the\noccurrence of this class of CMF reactions is strongly dependent\non the stability of the product ion. Eliminations of CO, H2Oo r\nROH by simple inductive cleavages can be favoured when they\nresult in resonance-stabilized allylic and benzylic ions.\nInductive cleavages can also occur when a heteroatom\nbearing a lone pair is adjacent to the charge site in the resulting\nfragment ion. This heteroatom can overlap the p orbitals of the\nvacant orbital in the carbon, thereby stabilizing the structure of\nthe fragment ion (Fig. 7.1.2).\n13\nThe third CMF presented in positive ions are displacement\nreactions, which are intramolecular processes in which the lone\npair of a heteroatom (Fig. 7.1.3a) or, eventually, thep-electrons\nof an unsaturated group (Fig. 7.1.3b) of a neighbouring group\n(e.g., a spatially close group) assists the elimination of the group\ncontaining the positive charge, becoming a neutral molecule.\n13\nThe mechanism of these gas-phase fragmentation reactions is\nsimilar to the anchimeric assistance that forms intermediate\nions (e.g., phenonium ions) in the solution phase. In this case,\nhowever, no further nucleophilic attack is noted on the struc-\nture of the resulting cyclic ion.\nA heteroatom with a lone pair can also assist the inductive\ncleavage that leads to the elimination of the group bearing the\npositive charge as a neutral group by removal of theb-hydrogen\n(Fig. 7.1.4). The concerted nature of the reaction mechanism of\nthis class of fragmentation suggests a similarity to the E2\nmechanism occurring in solution. In this case, however, the\nprocess is unimolecular: the base and the leaving group (i.e., the\ncharged group in the precursor ion, which will be eliminated as\na neutral group) are in the same molecule.\n44 As a result of the\nelimination assisted byb-hydrogen removal, a newp-bond is\nformed in the resulting fragment ion.\nFig. 7 General mechanisms of charge migration fragmentations (CMF) in positive (7.1) and negative (7.2) modes.\nFig. 6 Charge-migration fragmentation (CMF) reactions in positive (a)\nand negative (b) ions.\nThis journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016 Nat.

This\nreaction breaks an aliphatic or alicyclic chain into three frag-\nments.\n45,46 The group containing the positive charge ( E)i s\neliminated as a neutral molecule, whereas a new p-bond is\nformed between the C and D atoms, which are also eliminated.\nThe positive charge in the product ion is stabilized by the lone\nelectron pair of the heteroatom, and the occurrence of this\nreaction depends on the stability of the product ion. Consid-\nering that two bonds are formed and two other bonds are\nbroken in a Grob–Wharton fragmentation, the energy require-\nments for this reaction suggest a concerted mechanism because\nthe stabilizing eﬀect of the solvent on cationic or anionic\nspecies (as reported for Grob –Wharton fragmentations in\nsolution) does not operate in the gas phase.\n4.2 CMF for negative ions\nThe simplest fragmentation reaction involving negative ions is\nan a-elimination in which the pair of electrons from the atom\nbearing the negative charge (A) is used to form a newp-bond\nwith the adjacent atom (B) (Fig. 7.2.1). The bond between this\natom and the next atom (C) is then broken; thus, this latter\natom becomes negatively charged. Therefore, a-eliminations\nare the simplest fragmentation process occurring with negative\nions in the gas phase.\nThe second reaction for negative ions is the“g-elimination”.\nThis term was adopted to refer to a general class of reactions in\nwhich the neutral eliminated group has conjugated double\nbonds (Fig. 7.2.2). The group that will bear the negative charge\nin the product ion is usually in ag-position; however,3- or even\nz-eliminations can also occur, depending on the number of\ndouble bonds between the group with the negative charge in the\nprecursor ion (A) and the group that will bear the negative\ncharge in the product ion (E).\nDisplacement reactions can also occur with negative ions\nunder CID conditions. The nucleophilic group involved in\nanchimeric assistance must be spatially close to the electro-\nphilic site. In contrast to positive mode, the negative charge is\ntransferred to the group being eliminated (Fig. 7.2.3).\nHeteroatoms with lone electron pairs and other negatively\ncharged groups that provide anchimeric assistance in\ndisplacement reactions can also act as Lewis bases and assist\nthe formation of product ions by removing theb-hydrogen from\nthe group that will bear the negative charge. This class of\nfragmentation reactions results in the formation of a newp-\nbond in the eliminated molecule (Fig. 7.2.4).\nIn this review article, examples for each type of CRF and CMF\nwere selected to show the process of these reactions and to\nexemplify the characterization/elucidation of small molecules\nby MS/MS.\n5 CRF examples\n5.1 Remote hydrogen rearrangements\nThe most typical remote hydrogen rearrangements are those\ninvolved in dehydration reactions in compounds containing\na hydroxyl group in their structures, such as saponins47 (4) and\nneoclerodane diterpenes48 (5). The elimination of sugar from\nglycosylated compounds, such as neoclerodane diterpenes (6),48\nalso occurs through remote hydrogen rearrangement (Fig. 8).\nAlthough these reactions are one of the most prevalent\nfragmentations in natural products, the relative intensities of\nthe product ions in the MS/MS spectrum are not always high.\nThe entropy factor places steric restrictions on the product\nformation because of the tighter four-membered transition\nstate involved in this mechanism.\n13 However, these reactions\nFig. 8 Remote hydrogen rearrangements involved in the dehydration\nof saponins (a), diterpenes (b), glycosylated diterpenes and protonated\nplumeran alkaloids with the loss of a chain side (d).\n440\n| Nat.

Remote\nhydrogen rearrangements have also been reported for phos-\nphatidylglycerol,\n50 proteins51–56 and cyclic ethers.57\n5.2 Retro-Diels –Alder (RDA) reactions\nRDA reactions play a key role in the identication ofavonoids\nand their derivatives.58–68 The analysis of the resulting frag-\nments allows determination of the groups attached to the\nstructural core ofavonoids and the structural variation in this\nclass of compounds. Rijke and co-workers\n69 considered RDA\nreactions as the most important fragmentation reaction for\navones, dihydroavones, avonols and isoavones.

Typically, a H2O loss precedes\nthe RDA fragmentation by remote hydrogen rearrangement,\nforming an unsaturated moiety in the sugar unit (12.1), which\nenables the RDA process (Fig. 9). It is important to observe the\npreference of unsaturation formation between carbons 4\n0 and 50\nto form a more substituted alkene. Occasionally, the dehydrated\nfragment is not detected. The resulting enol fragment (12.2)\npresumably equilibrates to the keto form.\n75\nThe RDA fragmentation reactions are also reported for\nterpenoids that display a cyclohexene moiety (Fig. 10). In\nlimonoids (13), the RDA occurs in the lactone ring as indicated\nin Fig. 10a.\n76 In this case, the elimination of a carbonyl fragment\nadded to the elimination of a conjugated alkene (13.1) favoured\nthe RDA mechanism. In saponins (14), the RDA occurs in the\naglycone moiety, resulting in the major fragment ions ofm/z 203\n(14.2) andm/z 191 (14.1).77\nThis class of fragmentation reactions has also been reported\nfor isoquinoline alkaloids found in Chinese herbs78–80 (15). The\ndouble bond of the aromatic ring gives rise to the RDA frag-\nmentation in this case. Other cases include ca ﬀeine\n81 (16),\npolyprenylated xanthones fromGarcinia species82 (17), iridoids\nporphyrins83 and spirolide marine toxins (Fig. 10).84,85\n5.3 Retro-ene reactions\nThe retro-ene fragmentation pathways can be found in\ndeprotonated marine toxins (dinophysistoxins) (Fig. 11).

In addition to\nthe retro-ene reaction, other typical charge-retention frag-\nmentations, such as RDA at the B-ring, were also reported for\nthese compounds.\n86\nIn natural products with a prenyl side chain, such asavo-\nnoids, coumarins, and quinonoids, the elimination of the\nprenyl moiety involves a retro-ene reaction. Li and co-workers\n87\nreported that retro-ene reactions involved in the elimination of\nthe oxygenated prenyl chain from protonated prenylated fur-\nanocoumarins (19) occurs through the participation of the\ndouble bond of the aromatic ring and results in the fragment\nion of m/z 203 (Fig. 11b). The authors demonstrated that this\nfragmentation pattern could help to identify and diﬀerentiate\na variety of substituents on C-5 and C-8.\nA retro-ene reaction was also reported for long-chain unsat-\nurated fatty acids, which helped to determine the double bond\nposition and has been discussed in several mass spectrometry\nstudies.\n88–92\n5.4 Retro-heteroene reactions\nIn retro-heteroene reactions when A* (Fig. 4.4) is an oxygen\natom, retro-heteroene fragmentations are composed of two\nmajor groups of reactions: McLaﬀerty-type rearrangements93\nand retro-Aldol reactions.94 These reactions are common in\nnatural products possessing carbonyl groups in their structures,\nsuch as ketones, esters, carboxylic acids and amides. Part of the\ndriving force for these reactions is provided by the formation of\nthe extremely strong O–H bond.\n13\nMcLaﬀerty-type rearrangements have been reported for\na diversity variety of natural products possessing carbonyl\ngroups. This reaction is also involved in the formation of the\nfragment ions of polyether ionophore antibiotics ( 20) from\nStreptomyces sp. AMC 23 (Fig. 12a).\n93,95 Li and co-workers re-\nported the occurrence of McLaﬀerty-type hydrogen rearrange-\nments for the elimination of the prenyl chain from prenylated\nfuranocoumarins.\n87 In Fig. 12b, a gas-phase Claisen rearrange-\nment is followed by a McLaﬀerty-type rearrangement, leading\nto the elimination of the prenyl chain. This process is energet-\nically favoured by re-aromatization of the B-ring. Other terpe-\nnoids with side chains can also exhibit McLa ﬀerty-type\neliminations.\n21,96\nIn furanoheliangolides, such as budlein ( 22), this rear-\nrangement occurs with the participation of the vinylic methyl at\nthe angelate ester and leads to the formation of them/z 293\n(22.1) product ion (Fig. 13).\n21\nBenzoyl groups attached to the basic skeleton of natural\nproducts are o en described as being eliminated due to\nMcLaﬀerty-type rearrangements. For example, these rearrange-\nments were reported to be involved in the formation of benzoyl\namide (fragment ion,m/z 323, (23.1)) from steroidal alkaloids\nfound inBuxus papillosa(Fig. 13).83\nOne of the most common fragmentation processes in gly-\ncosylated natural products is the elimination of the sugar\nmoiety. When the aglycone unit has a carbonyl close to the\nsugar, a McLa ﬀerty-type rearrangement is expected to be\ninvolved in this elimination. Fig. 14a illustrates the sugar loss\nfrom chamaedryoside (24), a neo-clerodane diterpene isolated\nfrom Teucrium chamaedrys , which has sterically favourable\nconditions for the occurrence of a McLa ﬀerty-type\nrearrangement.\n48\nWang and co-workers studied the fragmentation of simvas-\ntatin (25) and lovastatin,97 two drugs responsible for lowering\nplasma cholesterol levels (Fig. 14b).

Both proposals require severe restrictions\nto occur; therefore, another process must be responsible for this\nwater elimination. Detailed analyses of a diterpene series\nallowed the authors to conrm the 1,3-hydrogen shi by a sig-\nmatropic rearrangement before the water elimination (Fig. 18).\nElimination of water from the initial ion structure could not\nresult in a stable ion structure. However, a 1,3-shi (sigmatropic\nrearrangement) alters the double bond position, thus allowing\nthe ion to lose water by a remote hydrogen rearrangement.\n5.8 Carbon monoxide eliminations from cyclic carbonyls\ncompounds\nSeveral natural products contain cyclic ketones, lactones\nand lactams moieties in their structures.

Gates and co-workers prepared labelled\nsamples of erythromycin containing\n18Ot oc o nrm the\nwater elimination mechanism aer carbonyl protonation.108\nThis unexpected reaction normally does not compete with\nthe CO elimination and occurs only under special condi-\ntions. However, the CO elimination due to a ring contraction\nis a common process in terpenoids,\n109 iridoids, 61 alka-\nloids, 78,110 quinones, 111–113 and avonoids, 114 among other\nstructures.\nFabre and co-workers published a systematic investigation of\navonoids in ESI-MSn (negative mode) and organized the frag-\nmentation of the unusual losses of CO, CO 2 and C3O2,i n\naddition to the retro Diels–Alder mechanism (RDA).115 Consid-\nering the CO elimination from the central ring, diﬀerent inu-\nences are observed between avanones and avanonols (no\ndouble bond between carbons 2 and 3) and avones and\navonols (with a double bond at carbons 2–3). Thisrst group\nhas the typical moiety expected for the general mechanism\nproposed in Fig. 4.8. In this case, we presented in Fig. 19 the\npossible initial equilibrium displayed in Fig. 4.8b, but both\nreactions can occur (35 and 36). Furthermore, foravone and\navonols, the vinylic carbanion may restrict the CO elimination\nfor this mechanism, suggesting a displacement reaction similar\nto that in Section 6.1.3.\n5.9 Radical fragmentation\nIn radical fragmentation, the most common process that\nconverts an even-electron ion into an odd-electron ion is the\nelimination of cCH\n3 from avonoids (in negative and positive\nmodes), 116 antraquinones 117 and terpenoids. 118 To clarify\nthis process, Vessecchi and co-workers applied experimental\nand computational analysis to calculate the energies of\nthe radical elimination of cHa n dcCH\n3 in isoavonoids. 43\nRadical species form above an Elab of 20 eV, and the calcu-\nlated enthalpies of thecCH3 elimination were approximately\n46 kcal mol /C0 1 for both of the methylated iso avonoids\nFig. 18 1,3-Shift rearrangements in diterpenes allowing sequential\nwater elimination through a stable carbocation.\nFig. 19 CO elimination inﬂavonoids.\n446 | Nat.

These observations con rmed the radical elimi-\nnation as a low energy process. For other non-methylated\nisoavonoids, cH elimination from the deprotonated mole-\ncule [M /C0 H /C0 H]\n/C0 c can also occur but may require higher\nenergy than cCH3 elimination in methylated isoavonoids. 43\nAdditionally, a er cCH3 or cH elimination, a second cH\nelimination may occur to reinstate the closed-shell system\n(Fig. 20).\nThe identical reaction for cCH\n3 was also observed in non-\nphenolic compounds, such as mycosporine-like amino acids\n(MAA) (Fig. 21).\n119 Again, theoretical calculations in addition to\nhigh-resolution mass spectrometry allowed a rationalization\nof the gas phase mechanism. The authors applied natural\nbond orbital (NBO) and atoms in molecules (AIM) calculations\nto explain [(M + H) /C0 15]\n+c in a MAA moiety. The ion was\ngenerated by the cleavage of the ether bond through a rein-\nforcement of the C(7; alkene)–O(14) bond and the consequent\nweakening of the O(14)–C(15; methyl) bond (Fig. 21). For MAA\nwith an extra acid function, the characteristic methyl radical\nloss was not observed in the positive mode.\n120 This result can\nbe easily explained because the homolytic cleavage was found\nt ob ed e p e n d e n to nt h ew e a k e n i n go ft h eO–Cb o n daer the\nprotonation and on the CO\n2 elimination to reduce the anion\ninternal energy.\n6 CMF examples\n6.1 Charge migration fragmentations (CMF) in positive ions\n6.1.1 Simple inductive cleavages.

Displacement reactions are\na common fragmentation process that lead to CO elimination\nfrom cyclic structures, such as lactones, lactams and avo-\nnoids.98,115,123 In these cases, the displacement reaction is\npreceded by the cleavage of the acylic bond and the consequent\nformation of the acylium ion.

In the rst step of this reaction, an\ninductive cleavage assisted byb-hydrogen removal of the oxygen\natom occurs to break a carbon–carbon bond.

The a-elimination is a typical elimi-\nnation mechanism of CO2 from deprotonated natural products\ndue to the presence of a carboxyl group in their structures. For\nexample, oxylipins [i.e., oxidized fatty acids involved in inam-\nmation (prostaglandin), cell proliferation and other important\nfunctions] have been reported to result from ana-elimination\n(Fig. 25a).\n127 In the case of hydroxyl fatty acids (Fig. 25b) such as\nthose biosynthesized by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the decar-\nboxylation occurs simultaneously with the hydrogen removal\nfrom the hydroxyl group. Therefore, the negative charge\nremains at the oxygen atom.\n128\nThe elimination of formaldehyde from deprotonated\ncompounds containing methoxyl groups attached to aromatic\nrings has been reported for many classes of natural products.\nHerath and co-workers\n129 investigated the fragmentation of\ndeprotonated dimethoxybenzoic acid derivatives and proposed\nthat the elimination of carbon dioxide and formaldehyde\ninvolves a-elimination (Fig. 25c). For natural products pos-\nsessing functional groups more acidic than methoxyl, the\nelimination of formaldehyde is likely to be preceded by proton\ntransfer under CID conditions.\nThe a-eliminations can be energetically favoured when the\nnegative charge in the product ion is stabilized by resonance. In\nFig. 26, the structure of the resonance stabilized enolate ion (m/\nz 675) resulting from an a-elimination is similar to those of\nproducts of retro-aldol reactions.\n94\nEliminations of CO from negative ions can also result from\na-elimination fragmentation reactions. In Fig. 27a, the simul-\ntaneous eliminations of CO (28 u) and C8H4O3 (148 u) from the\navonoid structure results in them/z 109 product ion, which is\nstabilized by resonance.\nMusharraf and co-workers investigated the fragmentation of\nabietane-type diterpenoid salvialeriafone and related compounds\nusing high-resolution electrospray ionization tandem mass\nspectrometry (HR-ESI-MS/MS).121 The authors reported the\nformation of them/z 269.15470 product ion from itsm/z 297.1462\nprecursor ion involving the formation of a three-centred inter-\nmediate ion, from which the CO elimination occurs bya-elimi-\nnation (Fig. 27b).\n6.2.2 g- and 3-eliminations. g-Eliminations have been re-\nported for select classes of natural products with conjugated\ndouble bonds in their structures, such as antraquinones and\navonoids.

Hsu and Turk demonstrated\ndisplacement reactions in the fragmentation mechanism of\ndiacylglycerophosphaticid acid (GPA) in negative ion mode\n(Fig. 28a).132 Based on the intensity of monitored deuterated\nions, the authors found that displacement reactions were\ndependent on steric factors. In deprotonated glycer-\nophosphocholines, such as those in Fig. 28b, a displacement\nreaction is involved in the formation of them/z 224 fragment\nion.\n133 These fragmentation reactions have also been reported\nfor diacylglycerols (DAG), such as 1-stearoyl-2-palmitoyl- sn-\nglycerol (Fig. 28c).134\n6.2.4 Eliminations assisted by b-hydrogen removal.Elimi-\nnations assisted byb-hydrogen removal can occur in phospha-\ntidylinositol and their derivatives (Fig. 29), where the phosphate\ngroup acts as a base (nucleophile) and removes thea-hydrogen\nof the carbonyl ester, leading to them/z 571 product ion by an\nelimination assisted by theb-hydrogen.\n48,135\n7 CRF versus CMF\nThe competition between CRF and CMF reactions in the gas\nphase under CID conditions has been investigated for select\nclasses of organic compounds, and the eﬀects of this competition\nhave been reported. In cases in which CRF and CMF originate\nfrom the identical fragment ion, experiments using isotopic\nexchange are mandatory. This strategy was used by Cydzik and co-\nworkers to investigate the competition between CRF and CMF in\nFig. 28 Displacement reactions in diacylglycerophosphaticid acid (a),\nglycerophosphocholines (b) and diacylglycerols (c).\nFig. 29 Eliminations assisted by b-hydrogen removal in\nphosphatidylinositol.\n450 | Nat.

TheE (trans) conguration favours the McLaﬀerty-\ntype rearrangement and does not allow removal of the a-\ncarbonyl; therefore, the m/z 176 product ion is not observed.\nHowever, the Z (cis) con guration favours the a-carbonyl\nhydrogen removal and does not allow the McLa ﬀerty-type\nrearrangement.\nSelect authors have reported the e ﬀect of the structural\nstability of the product ion reaction pathways between CRF and\nCMF. Denekamp and co-workers\n137 investigated the fragmen-\ntation of triphenylphosphonium cations using molecules with\ndiﬀerent substituents at the aromatic ring. The authors\nreported that an electron withdrawing group (e.g., /C0 NO\n2) in the\npara position favoured CRF reactions (Fig. 31a), whereas elec-\ntron releasing groups (e.g., /C0 CH3) at the identical position fav-\noured the CMF reactions (Fig. 32b). The tendency of electron\nreleasing groups to favour CMF reactions is related to their\nability to stabilize the positive charge in the transition state\ninvolved in the cleavage of the benzylic bond.\nQuirke and van Berkel investigated the competition between\nCRF and CMF in alkyl 1-methylpyridinium ether derivatives of\nalcohols.\n138 The authors established a correlation between the\noccurrence of CRF/CMF and the nature of the substituent\nattached at the side chain. When the substituent at the side\nchain can generate a stable fragment ion, CMF reactions are the\npredominant fragmentation reactions (Fig. 32a). When the side\nchain exhibited ag-hydrogen, a retro-ene reaction produced the\nm/z 110 product ion, which is the most intense in the MS/MS\nspectrum (Fig. 32b).\nIn natural products, a good example of the competition\nbetween CRF and CMF is the water elimination from proton-\nated diterpene alkaloids.\n106 This elimination can result from\na remote hydrogen rearrangement (CRF) or a single inductive\ncleavage (CMF) (Fig. 32c). When water is eliminated by a CMF\nreaction, a proton migration from the nitrogen atom to the\noxygen of the hydroxyl group under CID conditions appears to\nbe involved and results in a product ion stabilized by resonance.\nFig. 30 Competition between CRF and CMF in\nglycerophosphoethanolamine.\nFig. 31 Competition between CRF and CMF in triphenylphosphonium\ncations.\nFig. 32 CMF and CRF reactions in alkyl 1-methylpydirinium ions (a and\nb) and competition between CRF and CMF in diterpenealkaloids (c).\nThis journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016 Nat.

The fragmentation\nreactions observed are dependent on the structural core. It is\nimportant to reinforce the importance of working with the mass\ndiﬀerences rather than attempting to de ne the reactions\ninvolved in each fragment formation.\nIn this work, the readers cannd general mechanisms and\nexamples to understand the fragmentation reaction types that can\noccur in the gas phase. However, in the fragmentation ration-\nalization processes depicted in Fig. 1, the understanding of the\nmechanism must be combined with the knowledge about the\nidentity of the ion types that may be generated in the ionization\nsource. Thus, the general mechanisms of charge migration frag-\nmentation (CMF) and charge retention fragmentation (CRF)\nreactions (Fig. 4 and 7) proposed in this review can provide valu-\nable information about the structural requirements the molecule\nmust have to proceed through each reaction and can help the\nreaders identify structural features in the analytes of interest.\nFinding the description of fragmentation mechanisms to\nsupport identication in the literature remains challenging,\nand basic concepts in organic chemistry are not always\nconsidered when proposing the product ion structure from its\nprecursor ion, resulting in erroneous interpretations. There-\nfore, we recommend that inexperienced users employ Fig. 33 to\nremember the important steps before dening a new structure\nby ESI-MS/MS. Finally, this review aims to help readers inter-\nested in the structure elucidation of synthetic and natural\nproducts using ESI-CID-MS/MS and LC-MS/MS to propose\nreasonable fragmentation mechanisms based on organic\nchemistry principles.\n9 Acknowledgements\nDaniel P.
