In particular, \nhyperspectral imaging have been found to reveal physiological and structural characteristics in plants \nand to allow for tracking physiological dynamics due to environmental effects. In this work, we \npresent an approach to plant phenotyping that integrates non-invasive sensors, computer vision, as \nwell as data mining techniques and allows for monitoring how plants respond to stress. To uncover \nlatent hyperspectral characteristics of diseased plants reliably and in an easy-to-understand way, we \n“wordify” the hyperspectral images, i.e., we turn the images into a corpus of text documents. Then, \nwe apply probabilistic topic models, a well-established natural language processing technique that \nidentifies content and topics of documents. Based on recent regularized topic models, we demonstrate \nthat one can track automatically the development of three foliar diseases of barley. We also present a \nvisualization of the topics that provides plant scientists an intuitive tool for hyperspectral imaging. In \nshort, our analysis and visualization of characteristic topics found during symptom development and \ndisease progress reveal the hyperspectral language of plant diseases.\nThe plant phenotype is of importance to evaluate the performance of a crop as the interaction between a plant \ngenotype and its environment\n1. Recently, phenotyping is defined as a set of methodologies and protocols to assess \nplant parameters at different scales2,3. Within this context, non-invasive sensors and computer based technolo-\ngies demonstrated their potential to equip todays agriculture with tools to solve current and future challenges4. \nEspecially the detection of plant diseases is an important task in crop production to avoid yield losses, and in plant \nbreeding for the selection of diseases resistant genotypes. Today’s approaches to disease detection and planning \nof plant protection measures still very much rely on human experts and/or on prognosis models. Unfortunately, \nthese scale badly to the growing amounts of data in plant phenotyping and are prone to human conformation \nbias. Barley, for example, may be affected by various foliar pathogens during the vegetation period, and significant \nquantitative and qualitative yield losses are caused by diseases like powdery mildew, net blotch and brown rust\n5. \nEach of these diseases causes characteristic symptoms and the need to improve and to automatize their monitor-\ning in fields and/or greenhouses has led to an increasing adoption of technologies such as hyperspectral imaging. \nThis kind of sensor-based phenotyping has already been proven successfully for monitoring physiological traits \nand plant genotype-specific responses to biotic and abiotic stresses\n6–8. Especially hyperspectral imaging data of \nindividual plants or crop stands contains an enormous amount of information on their physiological and bio-\nchemical status\n7,9,10. The reflectance values of continuous wavebands of the electromagnetic spectrum are influ-\nenced by various plant characteristics; any kind of stress causes complex changes in the plants’ physiology and \ncomposition which, in turn, alters the spectral reflectance pattern (=  spectral signature) of plants in the visible \nrange (VIS, 400–700 nm), near-infrared (NIR, 700–1000 nm) and short wave-infrared (SWIR, 1000–2500 nm).\n1INRES-Phytomedicine, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany. 2Fraunhofer IAIS, Sankt Augustin, Germany. 3B-IT, \nUniversity of Bonn, Bonn, Germany. 4CS Department, Technical University of Dortmund, Dortmund, Germany. \n*These authors contributed equally to this work.

This indicates that phenotyping processes can \nbenefit from hyperspectral data analysis and machine learning techniques which can uncover the characteristics \nof how plants respond to environmental stress. However, since stress reactions result from a complex web of \ninteractions between the genotype and the environment12, common data analysis methods for plant phenotyping \nsuch as spectral vegetation indices run the risk of leading to an over-simplified or even misleading interpretation \nof spectral responses to stress as they consider only few distinct wavelengths. On the other hand, many advanced \nmachine learning techniques extract “factors” or “features” from the data that are not “things” with a “physical” \nreality13. In turn they are often not easy-to-interpret for non-experts in machine learning. Consequently, next \ngeneration plant phenotyping and plant disease detection systems require comprehensive and reliable data anal-\nysis methods.\nIn this work, we propose an automated data mining approach that was adopted from the areas of natural lan-\nguage processing and text mining. There, probabilistic topic models have been proven to successfully capture con-\ntent and underlying hidden topics of document collections and thus to help to organize, search, and understand \nlarge amounts of data14. Probabilistic topic model are known to allow for learning meaningful and interpretable \nrepresentations of massive document collections. As illustrated in Fig. 1(A), given a corpus of text documents, \ntopic models characterize each document using a small number of topics-the clusters. Topics are distributions \nover words estimated automatically from the documents, where semantically related words have higher proba-\nbilities (weights) within a topic. Due to the simple representation as distributions over words, topics are easy to \ninterpret for human analysts. Consider e.g. a subset of Wikipedia articles. Figure 1(B) shows the topics discovered \nby latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) 15—arguably the most popular probabilistic topic model—represented as \nword clouds containing the most probable words per topic. As one can see, probabilistic topics indeed result in a \nmeaningful short description; in our case, they are easily interpretable as “Music” , “Color” , or “Education” .\nOther common approaches for decomposing large data matrices into latent components include principal \ncomponent analysis (PCA), non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), and archetypal analysis (AA), among oth-\ners. PCA determines a factorization that retains as much variation in the data as possible16 and is often used for \ndata compression as it reduces noisy and redundant information. NMF17 considers matrices with non-negative \nentries and results in part-based representation of the data. AA 18,19 explains the data in terms of combinations \nof extreme observations, which are more distinct and hence are more interpretable by human analysts. All these \nmethods implicitly consider a document as a single point in an abstract high dimensional data space. Topic mod-\nels, in contrast, can provide interpretable representations, which have statistical properties that correspond to \nthose of semantic networks, produced by humans20. Furthermore, although there is a connection between NMF \nand probabilistic topic modeling21, NMF typically learns more incoherent topics than LDA22. Moreover, the LDA \nmodel is easier to explain as it is a generative model: word distributions compromises topics, and a document \nis drawn from a specific mixture of topics. In turn, the latent components determined by LDA are closer to the \nprobabilistic “topic metaphor” and do not require to reify the “ basis vectors” found by NMF . This is essential as \nthe application domain we consider in this work is interdisciplinary and requires scientist with different back -\nground to work together. Compared to methods that represent data in terms of extremes or archetypes, LDA can \nFigure 1. Example of interpretable matrix factorization using probabilistic topic models (A). It allows to \nrepresent the data (e.g. documents) as mixtures of only a few topics, which, in turn, can be learned from the \ndata. Illustration of topics learned from text (B) and hyperspectral signatures (C) using probabilistic topic \nmodels. The text topics are represented in terms of word clouds containing words with high probabilities. \nThe hyperspectral topics were determined using a wordification approach (C), and represent the spectral \ncharacteristics of healthy, diseased, and necrotic parts of leaves.\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n3\nScientific  RepoRts  | 6:22482 | DOI: 10.1038/srep22482\nbe considered as part-based archetypal analysis. Thus, the topics are extreme distributions in a space spanned \nby the words in the vocabulary. This view corresponds to the geometric interpretation of LDA as an analysis of \ndata points distributed on a latent simplex\n15 and, in turn, allows for representing the data as points in the simplex \nspanned by the topics.\nOur analysis is based on hyperspectral images of plants in the visible and near infrared ranges. While there are \noften labels per images such as different genotypes or treatmens of plants, the hyperspectral signatures from single \npixels on the images-the focus of our study-are typically not annotated. Hence, it is difficult-if not impossible-to \ndirectly employ classification approaches to gain insights into the important hyperspectral characteristics of \nplant disease progressions\n4,23. More importantly, the benefit of hyperspectral imaging for plant phenotyping goes \nbeyond the classification of plant stress. Recent studies 4,24,25 presented automated analysis pipelines for tracing \neffects of abiotic and biotic stress to crop plants. Within this context, probabilistic topic models are an intuitive \nand effective approach for automated, time and cost saving data analysis in order to obtain a deeper understand-\ning of plant pathogen interactions. As we will demonstrate, this exploratory data analysis approach can provide \nnew insights into processes during stress emergence and offers the ability to study how plant physiology is influ-\nenced during pathogen infection.\nIn order to extract meaningful topics, i.e. hyperspectral characteristics in terms of important wave-\nlength ×  reflectance pairs, we propose to “documentify” the hyperspectral images, i.e., we first create “documents” \nout of hyperspectral signatures. To this end, we “wordify” waveband-energy values as illustrated in Fig. 1(C). \nThen, we discover hyperspectral characteristics by means of an efficient online approach to regularized LDA. \nTogether, these steps allow one to automatically learn easy-to-interpret representations from large collections \nof hyperspectral images consisting of millions of pixels/signatures similar to representations used previously to \nanalyze plants suffering from drought\n26. In other words, this approach provides spectral characteristics of plants \naffected by various foliar pathogens during the vegetation period. The corresponding topics describe the devel-\nopment of different plant diseases during pathogenesis, allow for an intuitive visualization of information from \nhyperspectral images, and provide new insights into the dynamics of plant diseases.\nResults\nIn this section, we present and discuss our experimental evaluation on barley plants during development of the \nfoliar diseases powdery mildew, net blotch, and brown rust. The data set considered in this study consists of single \nbarley leaves, recorded every other day after inoculation (dai) with hyperspectral imaging line scanner in the vis-\nible and near infrared (400–1000 nm) range\n4. Each hyperspectral image was represented as dense Λ  ×  N matrix, \nwhere N denotes the number of pixels and Λ  the number of spectral bands. Stacking all data matrices recorded \nduring pathogenesis into a single matrix resulted in a data matrix with approximately 10 million columns or \nabout 2 billion matrix entries (encoding the reflected energy at different spectral bands). Before determining the \ntopics, we first created sparse matrices out of dense signature ×  pixel matrices using a wordification approach \n(see the Methods section). We then ran online regularized LDA for three datasets (for each disease) separately \nto obtain a set of highly relevant topics related to diseased as well as healthy barley plants. We stopped the online \ninference when each signature (document) was seen once for each data. Experiments were run on a standard Intel \nSixCore machine with 3.2 GHz and 16 GB main memory. It took approximately 1.5 hours to determine the topics \nfor each disease dataset where the number of topics was set to K =  25. The Python implementation of online reg-\nularized LDA is freely available at https://github.com/mirwaes/sclda.\nTopic Labeling. After the models were learned and specific topics for each disease and healthy barley plants \nwere obtained, we manually annotated the corresponding topics based on information from the literature and \ntheir relation to the plant health status. We identified eight classes for net blotch and powdery mildew and six for \nbrown rust. These are visualized in Fig. 2 and summarized in Table 1. Since diseased plants show signs of stress \nonly locally, they also contain examples of topics characteristic for healthy leaves, which can be found in classes 1  \nand 2 (green boxes) for all diseased plants. Furthermore, regularized LDA can also uncover the specific spectral \ncharacteristics at different stages of pathogenesis, as covered by the classes 3–7 for powdery mildew and net \nblotch, as well as in classes 3–6 for brown rust.\nIn contrast to previous works that considered full signatures to explain the disease progression (cf. Wahabzada \net al.\n4 and references thereine), the topics considered here provide a part based representation covering important \nwavelength ×  reflectance pairs. For instance, class 1 has top words (specific wavelength ×  reflectance) in the range \nof 550 nm which is highly correlated to the chlorophyll content10,27, the most important pigments in living plants \nas they are necessary for photosynthesis. The topics which were labeled as diseased in the VIS range (e.g. red \nand brown boxes in Fig. 2) have top words between 550–700 nm, indicating the disease symptoms such as small \nnecrotic tissue for net blotch, chlorotic spots in early rust development and auburn pustules, and fluffy mycelium \nand conidia distributed on the upper and lower leaf side for powdery mildew. This caused an overall increase of \nreflectances which was also observed by\n28,29 or by30 for Cercospora beticola in sugar beet.\nDisease Dynamics. The evaluated topics exhibit a specific location on diseased leaves. Therefore, each topic \ncould be connected to a specific symptom and the sum of all topics explains the spectral variability within bar -\nley leaves. Moreover, localization and probability of topics over time are highly dynamic. This is visualized in \nFig. 3(A) for the example of barley leaves infected with powdery mildew 6, 10 and 14 dai (days after inoculation). \nThe first two topics represent the border of a powdery mildew pustule and topic three represents the center of \npowdery mildew colonies. With further pathogenesis the dominance and probability of the topics change to \nsymptom development. Similar dynamics could be visualized for barley leaves with net blotch and brown rust. \nThis accords with Mahlein et al.\n30 and Wahabzada et al.4 who previously described hyperspectral dynamics of \ndiseased plants.\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n4\nScientific  RepoRts  | 6:22482 | DOI: 10.1038/srep22482\nTo compute the disease dynamics quantitatively, we determined the disease progression using the representa-\ntions learned by regularized LDA. We automatically labeled each pixel i on the image as “diseased” , when the sum \nof probabilities of labeled diseased topics was greater than a threshold value of ε =  0.25. Then, for each diseased \nleaf we computed the relative number of diseased/necrotic pixel for 6, 10 and 14 dai. As shown in Fig. 3(B), there \nis a difference in the amount of affected pixels (= size of infected area on a leaf) for plants inoculated with different \ndiseases. The number of pixels with disease topics is higher for leaves with powdery mildew than for those with \nother diseases (14 dai). Net blotch and brown rust show similar levels of infestation in the early stages. Brown rust \ncaused tiny chlorotic spots appearing on the tissue, necrosis and loss of water occur only at later stages. Therefore, \nit has a lower level of colonization than net blotch and powdery mildew in the early stages.\nRelative Relevance over Time. In a next step we computed topic relevance at different stages of disease \nprogression. To assess the age of disease symptoms, it is important to determine how likely it is to observe a par-\nticular topic at specific point in time during pathogenesis. Hence, we computed the relevance for a topic k using \nρρ ρθΩ =− ∑ = ∑=\n−\n=tD(1 )/ with /,kt kt i\nt\nki k d\nD\ndk1\n1\n1  where t denotes the day after inoculation and θd is the topics \nrepresentation of a document d. Note that we do not measure the appearance of the topics per pixel, as it was done \nin the previous section, but the relative increase in probability for each topic compared to the previous days. The \nword clouds in Fig. 2 show the results with respect to the increase in topic relevance 6, 10 and 14 dai. Here, the size \nof the text is proportional to the computed values Ωkt. The diseased/necrotic topics become more prominent at \nlater stages, whereas the significance of healthy (green) topics is low.\nThe diseased/necrotic topics for powdery mildew in Fig. 2(A) have higher importance starting at day 6 after \ninoculation. This can be explained by the high amount of white mycelial colonies on the the relatively intact tis-\nsue that caused a high number of conidia produced4. Net blotch, on the other hand, showed early chlorosis and \nnecrosis, causing structural and biochemical changes and necrotic tissue damage, as covered by the relevances \nin Fig. 2(B). Brown rust showed comparatively minor impact on barley tissue in early stages, which can be also \ndeduced from Fig. 2(C). First chloroses appeared around 7 dai causing an increase of the relevance of topics cov-\nering structural changes and pustule border. However, rust spores started to rupture the epidermis 10 dai, causing \nan increase in importance of topics related to sporulation.\nFigure 2. Examples of characteristic topics for different classes of plants diseased with powdery mildew, \nnet blotch, and brown rust and topic relevance over time (6, 10 and 14 dai). Each color indicates a different \nclass and a characteristic physiologic process, as summarized in Table 1. This approach visualizes the disease \nprogression and relevant information from hyperspectral images. The size of the text in every second row is \nproportional to the computed topic relevance. The diseased/necrotic topics become more prominent at later \nstages, whereas the significance of healthy (green) topics is low.\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n5\nScientific  RepoRts  | 6:22482 | DOI: 10.1038/srep22482\nDiscussion\nWe present an automated, data-driven pipeline for extracting characteristic spectral regions of plants, infected \nby foliar pathogens. Effective analysis and interpretation of hyperspectral imaging data are still limiting factors \nfor an implementation of sensor technologies into plant phenotyping or precision agriculture\n31,32. Probabilistic \ntopic models, originating from text mining, were successfully adopted to analyze hyperspectral images of plants. \nBased on the proposed pipeline, it is possible to uncover the hyperspectral language of plant diseases, to visualize \ncharacteristic topics during symptom development, and to monitor disease progress. Detecting and utilizing \ninformation of the electromagnetic spectrum of plants, infected with pathogens, one can observe disease devel-\nopment during pathogenesis\n33. The proposed pipeline strikes a new path for plant phenotyping and characteriza-\ntion of early processes during pathogenesis by optical sensors. The word clouds, shown in Fig. 2, are an example \nof an interpretable summary of high dimensional data, elucidating processes and key aspects of pathogenesis. \nCompared to common data analysis approaches, multiple benefits are present. In contrast to vegetation indices, \nwhich are a correlated to biophysical plant parameters and are not disease specific\n27,34, the entire spectral informa-\ntion is utilized effectively. Wavelet analysis, which outperformed a range of spectral vegetation indices in a predic-\ntive model for chlorophyll content\n35, aims to provide meaningful quantitative information, but would hardly be \ncapable to gather the entire complexity of up- and down regulated parameters during plant disease development. \nClassification methods such as Support Vector Machines or Artificial Neural Networks aim at differentiating \namong classes such as healthy or diseased plant tissue\n23,32. Here the results highly depend on the choice of features \nfrom hyperspectral images and could be a complementary methodology to our proposed probabilistic topic mod-\nels, avoiding time intensive and error prone human labelling.\nThe hyperspectral language of plants assessed with the wordification approach corresponds to the pheno-\ntype of diseased plants and enables a highly accurate description of disease progression over time and in space. \nThey result in hyperspectral topics that conform to plant physiological knowledge, allowing to characterize plant \npathogen interactions.

The wordification approach, \non the other hand, extracts latent part-based components that contain the reflectance intensities at different \nwavelengths, as shown in Fig. 2 and summarized in Table 1. They can be interpreted easily by domain experts. \nA comparison to a standard approach for topic models without regularization has revealed that the topics found \nby non-regularized LDA, shown in Supplementary Fig. 1(B), are not coherent. Furthermore, they are dominated \nby topics with lower reflectance intensities, which represent the healthy part of the leaf, while ignoring the var -\niations of diseased spectra. This is another justification for the proposed fast regularized LDA, as it considers \nthe short-range dependencies of hyperspectral words and produces coherent topics that can be associated with \ndifferent leaf disease stages.\nThe hyperspectral topics and the resulting word clouds visualizes the underlying biophysical and biochemical \nprocesses during disease development. The identified topics belong to specific regions of disease different symp-\ntoms or/and to specific developmental phases. This aspect is in accordance to30,36, who found characteristic spec-\ntral signatures for symptoms of Cercospora leaf spot of sugar beet, in time and space. The prominence of a specific \ntrait or developmental phase can be visualized intuitively by the presented wordification approach. Powdery mil-\ndew diseased tissue is covered by white mycelium colonies producing an increasing amount of conidia. Besides a \ndevelopment of characteristic powdery pustules, accompanying chlorosis can be read from the topic models. Net \nblotch and rust share the occurrence of chlorosis in early stages of disease development. Besides, net blotch causes \nearly necrosis. Due to this specific necrotrophic aspect, topics, correlated to pigment degradation, water loss and \ncellular tissue damage are characteristic for net blotch infestation. As a biotrophic fungi, P . hordei, the causal agent \nof rust disease has a moderate influence into the host plant biophysiology. The relation among healthy and dis-\neased tissue is well-balanced over time, sporulation specific topics appear at later time points. These observation \nare in accordance to hyperspectral dynamics of barley diseases visualized as single sketches and metro maps of \nplant diseases by4.\nOur work provides several interesting avenues for future work. Next to experiments under field conditions, \none should aim at even further improving the topic quality, for instance, by applying hierarchical, (semi-) super-\nvised and relational versions of topic modeling. The models may be used to identify the most relevant time \nwhen biologists have to gather samples for invasive, molecular examinations. Active LDA approaches could be \nemployed to speed up computations even further. This would also allow to discard documents or signatures \nduring learning, or to determine those which are most specific for a particular disease at different points in time. \nOne should also move from the unsupervised setting considered here to the supervised setting, for example, for \nclassifying disease-specific spectra at different stages of pathogenesis. One approach to do so would be to train, \nsay, a Support Vector Machine for each measurement day using our low-dimensional topic representation. A \nmore sophisticated approach would be to adapt a temporal classifier, say, a Conditional Random Field, or to even \nsmooth the embeddings over time using Dirichlet Multinomial Regression37. Ultimately, one should start devel-\noping joint models that compute low-dimensional embeddings via topics and classifications over time. This is a \nform of (semi)-supervised LDA, and the present work paves the way to do so.\nOverall, the proposed approach will support upcoming sensor applications for phenotyping tasks like, for \ninstance, the screening of disease resistant genotypes or precision agriculture applications for the localization of \nprimary disease foci in fields1,3,33.\nMethods\nPlant material and plant pathogens.  Analysis was done on a dataset recorded from barley plants \nwhich were grown in a controlled greenhouse environment and were used for hyperspectral measurements after \nFigure 3.

It exhibits a high \nsensitivity for disease detection and quantification.\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n7\nScientific  RepoRts  | 6:22482 | DOI: 10.1038/srep22482\nreaching growth stage 32. A detailed description of the plant material and pathogens can be found in Wahabzada  \net al.4. The plants were inoculated with different fungal pathogens, namely, Pyrenophora teres (causing net blotch), \nPuccinia hordei (causing leaf rust of barley), and Blumeria graminis hordei (causing powdery mildew). A control \ngroup was kept non-inoculated. Hyperspectral images were recorded 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 days after inoculation (dai) \nwith an ImSpector V10E, which covers the visible and near-infrared (400–1000 nm) range. The camera has a \nspectral resolution of 2.8 nm and a spatial resolution of 0.12 mm per pixel, and results in 210 hyperspectral bands. \nThe Savitzky-Golay filter38 was applied to remove noise and to smooth the hyperspectral signature information.\nWordification. We are interested in finding characteristic patterns in the combination of reflectance val-\nues at specific wavelength. To this end, we employ probabilistic topic models which require input in terms of \nsparse data matrices. We therefore apply wordification to given hyperspectral images. In particular, we propose \nto discretize hyperspectral signatures as follows: we decompose the space covering the full signatures into R \npossible reflectance words. Since reflectance values are normalized they range from 0 and 1 and thus facilitate \nthis decomposition. Accordingly, in a signature each wavelength can consist of one of the R distinct reflectance \nwords, which results in a total number of Λ   ×  R different possible spectral words . This process is illustrated in \nFig. 1(B) and detailed in Supplementary Fig. S2(A). It shows an example of a hyperspectral image where each \npixel is represented by a signature. After wordification, each document (signature) is represented by Λ   out of \nΛ  ×  R possible spectral words. The benefits of this approach are that it is fast to compute, does not require addi-\ntional efforts to construct a dictionary, and yields interpretable results since each word correspond to a specific \nwavelength-reflectance pair. The use of discretized values instead of continuous ones is further motivated by the \nfact that, according to plant physiologist, small difference in reflectance values are of minor importance.\nNevertheless, since signatures are still curves over spectral bands, we also take the short-range dependencies \nof words into account. For that we compute a word-dependency matrix C , cf. Supplementary Fig. S2(B), that \nis created using pointwise mutual information (PMI). PMI as the measure of word association is defined as \nfollows\n39:\n=.PMIw w\nPw w\nPw Pw\n(, )l og\n(, )\n() () (1)\nij\nij\nij\nIn order to also capture co-occurrences between different reflectances within a wavelength, we proceed as \nfollows: we first aggregate the signatures in the images into non-overlapping squares of 5 ×  5 pixels. Spectral \nword co-occurrences are computed using a sliding window of stride length 1 in each direction (wavelength and \nreflectance) in the aggregated signatures. Next, given the document-word representation of signatures and their \nshort-range dependencies, we are ready to apply regularized topic models.\nFor our experiments on hyperspectral images of diseased plants, we transformed each signature into docu-\nment representation by setting R =  50, before running the topic models. We computed the PMI only for the words \nwith minimum appearance of N\nw =  250 and only kept the positive values.\nRegularized Probabilistic Topic Models.  LDA, as proposed by Blei et al. 15, is a Bayesian probabilistic \nmodel that describes a generative process of how words in documents might be generated on the basis of latent \ntopics. Fitting an LDA topic model given a set of training documents requires approximate inference techniques \nthat are computationally expensive. For instance, in variational Bayesian (VB) inference, the true posterior is \napproximated using a simpler, fully factorized distribution q. For that, following\n15,40, we choose q(z, θ, β) of the \nform φ==qz k() di dw kdi\n, θθ γ=qD ir() (, )dd d , and ββ λ=qD ir() (, )kk k . The variational parameters φ, γ, and λ \nare optimized to maximize the Evidence Lower BOund (ELBO)\n\nαη φγ λ\nθβ αη θβ\n≥\n−\nLpw w\npw zq z\nlog( ,) (, ,, )\n[log (, ,, ,) ][ log( ,, )] , (2)qq\nwhich is equivalent to minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between q (z, θ, β) and the true posterior \nθβ αηp zw( ,, ,, ).\nFor introducing a structured prior to regularize the word-topic probabilities, one can build on top of the recent \nregularized Gibbs approach due to39, who have demonstrated that regularization improves the topic coherence. \nBefore presenting a scalable online approach for regularized LDA, we present a variational Bayes inference for \nthe batch case.\nVariational Bayes Inference for Regularized LDA. For regularized LDA, we view each topic as a mix-\nture of word probabilities given by the word-pair dependency matrix C (a W ×  W matrix, where W denotes the \nsize of vocabulary and Cij ≥  0), that is\nβη ∝∼ .Cb bD irwhere( ) (3)kk k\nIn VB, the true posterior is approximated using fully factorized distributions q. Consequently, we parameter-\nize the word probabilities b by introducing a new variational parameter v, i.e. ν=qb Dirb() (, )kk k . The per-word \ntopic assignments z are parameterized by φ, and the posterior over the per-document topic weights θ are param-\neterized by γ, as for the standard LDA. The part of the likelihood including the specific parameter v can then be \nwritten as\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n8\nScientific  RepoRts  | 6:22482 | DOI: 10.1038/srep22482\n η=+ −νL pw zC bp bq b[log (, ,) ][ log( )] [log () ] (4)qq q[]\nand the remaining part of the ELBO remains unchanged.

Since a single image can already consist of hundreds of thousands of signatures (documents) so that sev-\neral images (as in the case of our experiments) easily scale to several million documents, batch VB is likely to be \ninfeasible in terms of running time. Consequently, we will develop an online variant of regularized VB that scales \nwell to massive datasets.\nOnline Variational Bayes Inference for Regularized LDA. Since setting the word-dependency matrix \nC to identity matrix results in standard VB, it is intuitively clear that we may extend the regularized VB to the \nonline case by adapting online variational Bayes 40. Specifically, the variational lower bound for the regularized \nVB can be written as\n\n\n \n∑\n∑\nθθ\nθα\nθη\nφγ ν\n=+\n−+\n−+ −\n≜ℓ\nL\nC\npw zC bp z\nqz p\nqp bq b\nn\nD\n{[ log( ,, ,) ][ log( )]\n[log () ][ log( )]\n[log () ]( [log () ][ log( )] )/ }\n(, ,, ,) ,\n(15)\nd\nD\nqd dd qd d\nqd qd\nqd qq\nd\nD\ndd d\nwhere φγ ν n C(, ,, ,)dd d  is the dth document’s contribution to the variational bound. The per-corpus terms are \nsummed together and divided by the number of documents D. This allows us to derive the online approach since \nthe optimal v is the one for which L maximized after fitting the per-document parameter. In other words, we can \nuse the regularized updates in a per-document manner as summarized in Fig. 4.\nThe algorithm first randomly selects documents from the entire dataset by forming a mini-batch ˜D. Then, an \nE-step is performed to find locally optimal values of γ and φ while holding β fix. In the M-step, several fixed point \nupdates for ν are computed using\n\n∑∑νφ η=\n∑\n+\n∈\n\n˜\nD\nS\nCb\nCb\nexp( [log ])\nexp( [log ]) (16)\nwk\ndD i\nW\ndik\niw qi k\nj ij qj k\ngiven the document-specific parameter φd with ∈ ˜d D (currently observed mini-batch), where we re-scale by D\nS  \nto update as though we would have seen all documents. Multiple documents are used per update to reduce vari-\nance. The parameter ν is updated through a weighted average of its previous value, and ν (computed for the cur-\nrent mini-batch using fixed point updates as in Eq. (16)). Furthermore, new values of β are computed given ν and \nword-dependency matrix C. The rate of change ρt is set to ρ τ + κ− t()t 0  with κ ∈.(0 5, 1] in order to guarantee \nconvergence. Note that, as in the non-regularized case, when setting the batch size to S =  D and κ = 0 we recover \nregularized batch VB.\nFigure 4.
