However, the\nsubstantial length of sustainability reports (often\nmore than 70 pages) makes it challenging for the\nmajority of stakeholders (including investors, pol-\nicymakers, and the general public) to digest and\nanalyze them. At the same time, relying on third-\nparty rating agencies is not always a solution, as\ntheir services can be expensive, lack transparency,\n1Web app: https://reports.chatclimate.ai/ Demo video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5AzaKzPE4M&t=15s\n2https://github.com/EdisonNi-hku/chatreport\nand vary due to differing criteria for evaluating\nsustainability performance (Berg et al., 2022).\nIn light of these challenges, automated and trans-\nparent approaches are essential to improving acces-\nsibility, efﬁciency, and accuracy when analyzing\ncorporate sustainability reports.\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) (Brown et al.,\n2020; Ouyang et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023a;\nOpenAI, 2023a; Touvron et al., 2023b, inter alia)\nhave revolutionized Natural Language Processing\n(NLP), enabling advancements in automated rea-\nsoning, understanding, and generation of text. Such\nadvances can assist in conducting comprehensive\nanalyses of corporate sustainability reports auto-\nmatically. However, to develop such an LLM-based\nsystem, there are two major challenges: LLMs (1)\nmay hallucinate in their outputs (Ji et al., 2023),\nand (2) have no expertise in sustainability report\nanalysis. Furthermore, there exists no framework\nwhich would actively involve domain experts in\nthe prompt development loop, injecting domain\nexpertise into the prompts.\nIn this paper, we propose CHAT REPORT , a sys-\ntem that automatically analyzes sustainability re-\nports based on the TCFD3 (Task Force on Climate-\nrelated Financial Disclosures) recommendations. It\ncomputes the reports’ conformity score to TCFD\nguidelines, proposing the ﬁrst automatic metric for\ndisclosure quality benchmarking. CHAT REPORT\nalso supports customized analysis with user ques-\ntion answering. To reduce hallucination, we ground\nthe analytical prompts with retrieved information\nfrom the target report, and further make the answers\ntraceable to help users identify hallucinations. To\nactively bring domain experts into the development\nloop, we design an automatic prompt engineering\nalgorithm that transfers experts’ feedback on spe-\nciﬁc outputs to general analysis guidelines, which\n3We choose TCFD instead of other disclosure guidelines\nbecause it is widely adopted and investor-friendly. Appendix L\ncovers an introduction for TCFD.\n21\nSemantic Search\nReport Summarization\nEleven Questions ChatGPT\nTCFD Conformity Assessment\nOfficial Guidelines ChatGPT\nCustomized QA\nUsers’ Questions ChatGPT\nPrompts with \nDomain Expertise\nReport Embedding\nSplit into chunks text-embedding-\nada-002\nSustainability \nreport\nSave to \nvector DB\nAnswers to TCFD \nQuestions with \nReferences to Pages\nAnalyses of Each \nTCFD Points and \nConformity Scores\nAnswers to User’s \nQuestions with \nReferences to Pages\nFigure 1: CHAT REPORT Pipeline\ncan be injected into our prompt template for future\nanalysis.\nFurthermore, we conduct a rigorous human eval-\nuation to analyze the system’s hallucination rate\nquantitatively. We ﬁnd that the system achieves an\nadmirable hallucination-free rate. For those hallu-\ncinated cases, it is easy for users to identify them\nbecause the system always (1) refers to relevant\nsources and pages; and (2) answers questions in\nan extractive manner, making it convenient to iden-\ntify evidence sentences by keyword search. More-\nover, we achieve a moderate inter-annotator agree-\nment on annotating hallucination (Cohen’s Kappa\nof 0.54), further illustrating that the discrepancies\nbetween answers and references are easy to iden-\ntify. Our human evaluation results in an annotated\ndataset of LLM outputs with attributions, which\nmay contribute to other domains (e.g., LLM attri-\nbution veriﬁcation (Yue et al., 2023) to check the\nsupportiveness of cited sources for the answer.).\nOur contributions include:\n1. We introduce CHAT REPORT , a novel system\nthat automatically analyzes sustainability re-\nporting along different dimensions.\n2. We develop an efﬁcient framework to actively\ninvolve domain experts in AI tool develop-\nment, which may potentially beneﬁt all inter-\ndisciplinary research.\n3. We conduct a human evaluation on CHAT RE-\nPORT ’s hallucination and attribution. The re-\nsulting dataset contributes to automatic attri-\nbution veriﬁcation.\n2 Related Work and Background\nNLP for Climate Change NLP technologies have\nbeen employed in various areas, including meta-\nanalyses in climate science (Callaghan et al., 2021),\nor for ﬁnancial climate disclosure analyses (Bin-\ngler et al., 2022a; Luccioni et al., 2020), detecting\nstance in media about global warming (Luo et al.,\n2020), detecting environmental claims (Stamm-\nbach et al., 2023), and climate claims fact-checking\n(Diggelmann et al., 2020; Webersinke et al., 2022).\nMore recently, Vagheﬁ et al. (2023) introduced\nCHAT CLIMATE , a chatbot based on the latest\nIPCC Assessment Report. By leveraging NLP,\nresearchers aim to extract valuable insights from\ntextual data related to climate change to advance\nresearch, decision-making, and public engagement.\nLarge Language Models LLMs have emerged as\nthe de-facto standard in recent years (Brown et al.,\n2020; Ouyang et al., 2022; Chowdhery et al., 2022;\nTouvron et al., 2023a; Anil et al., 2023; OpenAI,\n2023a; Touvron et al., 2023b). Instruction ﬁne-\ntuned models, such as ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023b)\nand GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023a), have showcased their\npotential on comprehensive prompt-based AI ap-\nplications (Shen et al., 2023; Schick et al., 2023).\nSome strong LLMs can even be a cheap and reli-\nable proxy for human preference, evaluating the\nquality of generated texts (Chiang et al., 2023;\nKocmi and Federmann, 2023; Zheng et al., 2023).\nHowever, hallucination still remains a major lim-\nitation of the SOTA LLMs (Ji et al., 2023). Related\nwork has proposed initial efforts to (1) better align\nLLMs (Zhou et al., 2023); and (2) ﬁght false attri-\nbution from LLM-based search engine (Liu et al.,\n2023; Yue et al., 2023) and LLM-generated misin-\nformation (Peng et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023). These\nefforts suggest potential ways to mitigate LLM\nhallucinations, but still left it as an open research\nquestion.\nUtilizing Experts’ Feedback Involving a human\nin the loop has a long history in machine learn-\ning and NLP. However, previous work mainly fo-\ncuses on active learning (Raghavan, 2006; Wu et al.,\n2021) and using human feedback to improve spe-\n22\nciﬁc outputs (Elgohary et al., 2020; Tandon et al.,\n2021). In this work, we propose a novel prompting-\nbased approach to automatically improve general\nprompts using experts’ feedback on speciﬁc out-\nputs, which actively brings human experts into the\nprompt engineering loop.\n3 CHAT REPORT\n3.1 Pipeline\nThe pipeline of CHAT REPORT is illustrated in Fig-\nure 1. Given a sustainability report, CHAT REPORT\nanalyzes it with the following four modules.\nReport Embedding (RE) To address the limited\ncontext window, the RE module ﬁrst splits the re-\nport into text chunks, which are then transformed\ninto a vector space representation for future ref-\nerence and semantic searching. We have domain\nexperts transfer TCFD recommendations to queries\nfor retrieval (details in Appendix E).\nReport Summarization (RS) To assist in efﬁ-\nciently reading the report, the RS module sum-\nmarizes it based on TCFD’s eleven recommended\naspects that companies are asked to describe. Given\neach TCFD recommendation, the RS module ﬁrst\nretrieves the relevant part from the report using our\ncarefully designed query. Then it prompts the LLM\nto summarize the report’s disclosure on that TCFD\nrecommendation, with the retrieved part (from the\nRE module) and the company’s basic information\nas context. Prompt templates for this module can\nbe found in Appendix A.\nTCFD Conformity Assessment (TCA) In addi-\ntion to the recommendations, TCFD also provides\ndetailed disclosure guidelines for each recommen-\ndation, which specify the type and granularity of\ninformation that companies need to disclose in\ntheir report. To evaluate the reports’ conformity to\nTCFD guidelines, we design the TCA module to\nanalyze to which extent the report follows TCFD\nguidelines: for each TCFD recommendation, the\nTCA module takes in relative contexts from the RE\nmodule. It then evaluates it against the respective\nTCFD guidelines, generating an analysis paragraph\nand a TCFD conformity score from 0 to 100. The\nprompt template for this model can be found in\nAppendix D.\nBy explicitly deﬁning the scoring criteria and\nproviding clear instructions, we aim to minimize\npotential biases and enhance the reliability of the\nevaluation process. However, it is essential to ac-\nknowledge that the LLM-generated scores might\nbe far from perfect (Zheng et al., 2023). We believe\nthat the scoring strategy implemented in our study\nrepresents a valid and valuable ﬁrst step toward\nleveraging AI-based and automated methods for\nrating sustainability reports. We encourage future\nresearch and collaborative efforts to reﬁne and im-\nprove this scoring strategy, considering alternative\nperspectives by including additional data sources\nand engaging a broader range of stakeholders.4\nCustomized Question Answering (CQA) Be-\nyond the analytical structure provided by our frame-\nwork, we enable users to conduct a personalized\nanalysis by posing customized questions. Our\nprompt template takes in the user’s question and\nthe retrieved relevant contexts which are queried\nby the question itself (using the RE module). Then,\nthe CQA module makes an LLM call to answer\nthe question. The CQA module’s prompt template\nis almost the same as the RS module’s question-\nanswering prompt template, but with slightly differ-\nent responding guidelines to deal with the noisier\nscenario where the questions are customized by the\nusers (see details in Appendix C).\n3.2 Implementation Details\nWe use ChatGPT as the base LLM to conduct\nexperiments and analysis in this paper. We use\nLangChain5 to manage OpenAI API calls and\nvector-database retriever. We use OpenAI’s text-\nembedding-ada-002 for text chunk embedding. Em-\npirically, we ﬁnd that splitting reports into chunks\nof 500 characters (with an overlap of 20 charac-\nters between chunks) results in the best retrieval\nperformance. We usually retrieve the top 20 re-\nlated chunks from the RE module. If the prompt\nbecomes too long (e.g., more than 4000 tokens)\nafter inserting the retrieved chunks, we gradually\nremove the least relevant chunks until the prompt\nis suitable for the context window. We set the tem-\nperature to 0 for all LLM calls and reuse a static\nvector database for each report.\n3.3 Answer Traceability\nTo reduce hallucinations and improve interpretabil-\nity, we attach source numbers to retrieved chunks\n4We recall that our TCFD conformity score is not a rating\nor assessment of actual actions or commitments made by\ncompanies to address climate change. Instead, it measures the\nextent to which companies disclose relevant climate-related\ninformation in their ﬁnancial reports.\n5https://python.langchain.com/\n23\nand prompt the LLM to provide its attribution (i.e.,\nthe chunks it refers to when summarizing informa-\ntion about TCFD recommendations and answering\nusers’ questions). With the references attached,\nhuman experts can efﬁciently check whether the\nmodel produces misinformation. In Section 5.1, we\nquantitatively analyze the system’s answer trace-\nability on a sampled set of outputs.\n3.4 Expert-Involved Prompt Development\nPrompt development is the critical part ofCHAT RE-\nPORT to make sure the outputs (1) contain granular\ndetails that stakeholders care about; (2) are for-\nmulated in an honest and traceable way; and (3)\ndemonstrate awareness of potential cheap talk and\ngreenwashing. To accomplish this, it is crucial for\nour domain experts to actively participate in prompt\ndevelopment. We ﬁrst write several prompt tem-\nplates, choosing one of them based on domain ex-\nperts’ feedback on outputs. Then we empower do-\nmain experts with an LLM-based automatic prompt\nengineering tool, enabling them to ﬁne-tune the\nprompts’ speciﬁcs autonomously, without the help\nof human prompt engineers. Details are described\nbelow:\nPrompt Template Selection: Question Answer-\ning or Summarization? There are multiple ways\nto prompt an LLM to summarize a report’s disclo-\nsure regarding TCFD recommendations. One is to\ndirectly copy the original TCFD recommendation\nand prompt the LLM to summarize it (e.g., In gov-\nernance, the company must describe the board’s\noversight of climate-related risks and opportuni-\nties). Another is to ﬁrst transfer the recommen-\ndation to a question about the report (see E for\nquestion-transformation details), then prompt the\nLLM to answer the question (e.g., How does the\ncompany’s board oversee climate-related risks and\nopportunities?). Our prompts for both scenarios are\ndisclosed in Appendix A. We evaluate the prompt\ntemplates with experts involved, where the expert’s\nfeedback shows that question answering outper-\nforms disclosure summarization (one example is\nshown in Table 2).\nAutomatic Prompt Engineering Without granu-\nlar adjustment on prompts, ChatGPT’s analysis of\na sustainability report differs a lot from a human\nexpert’s. For example, ChatGPT tends to ﬂatter\nthe user (due to its instruction-following nature),\nanswering with optimism prior and becoming less\ncritical of the possible cheap talk and greenwash-\nPlease adhere to the \nfollowing guidelines\nin your answer\n1. Your response \nmust be precise, \n...\n2. If you are unsure, \nsimply \nacknowledge the \nlack …\nGuideline List\nChatGPT\n QA-Prompt\nQ: In which \ntechnologies will \nthe company invest \nin the next few \nyears?\nA: Toyota plans to \ninvest in \nenvironmental \ntechnology…\nDomain Experts\nMultiple Outputs\nIt is not clear which \npart of Toyota's plan is \nquantitatively \ngrounded by number \nof budget and which \npart is just qualitative \nsteps.\nExperts’ Feedback\nGPT-4\n Auto-Prompt-\nEngineering Prompts\nNew Guidelines\n3.

ChatGPT also tends to be wordy,\nincluding irrelevant or even hallucinated informa-\ntion in its response. Moreover, analysts usually\nexpect critical information from a good summa-\nrization corresponding to TCFD recommendations,\nfor example, the quantiﬁability and veriﬁability\nof the disclosure. However, ChatGPT fails to in-\nclude such information because it is not explicitly\nstated in the TCFD recommendations. Analysts\nmay even expect speciﬁc implicit information for\neach recommendation. To better incorporate these\ncomprehensive, speciﬁc, and granular requirements\nin prompting, we design an automatic prompt en-\ngineering tool so that the domain experts can efﬁ-\nciently transfer their feedback on speciﬁc outputs\nto general analysis guidelines which can be used to\nimprove the prompts.\nThe workﬂow of automatic prompt engineering\nis illustrated in Figure 2. The domain experts ﬁrst\nsuggest improvements for speciﬁc answers. Then\nwe prompt ChatGPT to transform the feedback into\nguidelines that can be used to guide future TCFD\nquestion answering. In our prompt template, there\nis a list of guidelines that the LLM needs to ad-\nhere to in its answer. The generated guidelines are\nthen appended to this list to improve the prompts.\nWe started with a guideline list containing general\nguidelines for honest question answering:\nPlease adhere to the following guidelines in\nyour answer\n1. Your response must be precise , thorough ,\nand grounded on specific extracts from the\nreport to verify its authenticity .\n2. If you are unsure , simply acknowledge the\nlack of knowledge , rather than fabricating\nan answer .\nThen we develop new guidelines based on an-\nswers generated with this guideline list. Finally,\nwe select ﬁve general guidelines for all question an-\nswering and one speciﬁc guideline for each TCFD\nrecommendation. The general and speciﬁc guide-\nlines can be found in Appendix C. Prompts of au-\ntomatic prompt engineering can be found in Ap-\npendix B.\n24\nFigure 3: Density plot of the TCFD conformity for an\narbitrary sample of corporate sustainability reports of\ncompanies listed on NYSE, sampled from 2016 and\n2021/22.\n3.5 Feedback Collection\nWe regard CHAT REPORT as an ongoing learning\nsystem instead of a static analysis tool. Besides our\ndomain experts, we also want to engage our users in\nthe development and learning loop. We will collect\nusers’ feedback on TCFD disclosure summariza-\ntion and TCFD conformity analysis. Such feedback\ncan either be used for both prompt improvements\nusing our automatic prompt engineering method\nor be saved for memory and reﬂection for future\nreﬁnements (Tandon et al., 2022).\n4 Usages\nWe collected 9781 sustainability reports spanning\n2010 to 2022 (ﬁscal years). Most of the reports\nare companies that are traded on the NASDAQ and\nNYSE. We ﬁnd that the number of pages in cor-\nporate sustainability reports has slightly increased\nover recent years: in the ﬁscal year 2017, the mean\nlength of the report has been at 59 pages. In 2021,\nthis number increased to 70 pages, illustrating the\nincreasing effort required by analyzing the reports\nmanually.\nTCFD Conformity Analysis Using the RS and\nTCA modules, we summarize TCFD disclosures\nand compute TCFD conformity scores for 1015\nsustainability reports. Among these reports, 777\nare from 2021 and 2022, while 227 are from 2016.\nFigure 3 illustrates the distribution of these scores\nfor the two sample sets. Our ﬁndings indicate\na signiﬁcant impact of the TCFD recommenda-\ntions on the average TCFD conformity, suggesting\nthat companies embrace these guidelines.

It is necessary to consider the possibility\nof “cheap talk,\" where ﬁrms may make superﬁ-\ncial claims without substantial actions to address\nclimate-related issues (Bingler et al., 2022b). In\nAppendix H, we showcase TCFD conformity anal-\nyses on sustainability reports of JP Morgan Chase,\nShell and UBS in detail to illustrate the analytic\nusage of CHAT REPORT .\nCustomized Analysis The CQA module allows\nusers to customize their analysis through question-\nanswering. Appendix G provides some illustrative\nexamples of valuable analytic questions. Posing\nthese questions allows us to gain valuable insights\nfrom the sustainability reports beyond the TCFD\nrequirements summarized by the RS modules.\n5 Hallucination Analysis\nWe conduct a human evaluation to assess the fre-\nquency and degree of hallucinations in CHAT RE-\nPORT ’s output when answering questions.6 Hal-\nlucination is evaluated along two dimensions: (1)\nContent: An answer is not hallucinated if all its\ncovered information is supported by the report. All\nanswers that are not fully supported (e.g., extrapola-\ntion or partial support) are considered hallucinated\non the content dimension. (2) Source: An answer\nis not hallucinated on the source dimension only\nwhen the model honestly reports its references and\nthe content is not hallucinated; otherwise, the an-\nswer is hallucinated on the source dimension (we\nuse binary annotation inspired by (Krishna et al.,\n2023)).\nWe randomly sampled 10 sustainability reports\n(110 TCFD question-answering pairs in total) for\n6It is important to note that we analyze the answers’ hon-\nesty instead of quality.\n25\nhuman evaluation (sampling details in Appendix F).\nWe have two different annotators to annotate each\nanswer. If there is a disagreement on labeling, we\nassign a third annotator to make the decision. We\nconduct human evaluations on both ChatGPT and\nGPT-4 as the backbone LLM.\nWe surprisingly ﬁnd that despite our strict an-\nnotation standard, CHAT REPORT reaches a satis-\nfactory hallucination-free rate. With ChatGPT,\nit honestly conveys information from the report\n83.63% of the time, considering the 51.5% aver-\nage hallucination-free rate of existing generative\nsearch engines reported by Liu et al. (2023).7 Fur-\nther ﬁndings and discussion are presented in the\nfollowing subsections.\n5.1 Answer Traceability\nWe ﬁnd that CHAT REPORT follows our instructions\nwell by answering questions through copying or\nclose paraphrasing. Table 1 shows that the answers\nachieve a high ROUGE precision score against\nthe report content no matter with which backbone\nLLM, illustrating that the answers tend to adhere to\nthe reports’ original utterances. This makes the out-\nputs easy to trace using a simple keyword search.\nIf a piece of information is not entailed by its ev-\nidence sentence, we mark it as hallucinated. An\nexample can be found in Appendix J.\n5.2 How Does CHAT REPORT Hallucinate?\nMost of the hallucinations on the content dimension\nlie in extrapolating reference chunks. Here is an\nexample where the answer falsely concatenates two\nseparate chunks:\nRetrieved chunks in a prompt:\nContent : ... Assurant may incur additional\ncosts associated with tracking\nSource : 174\nContent : climate hazards . Own Operations : In\naddition to those noted in ...\nSource : 186\n... ( more chunks and their source numbers )\nLLM Answer:\n... Risks include additional costs associated\nwith tracking climate hazards , declining\nproperty values due to sea - level rise ...\nAlthough we explicitly told the model that the\nretrieved chunks might contain incomplete sen-\ntences at both ends and the chunks are delineated\nby source numbers and new lines, the LLM occa-\nsionally falsely concatenates two chunks or makes\n7We quote Liu et al.’s (2023) result for reference. These\nnumbers are not fully comparable because of the differences\nin task and data. See more in Appendix I.\nerroneous extrapolations based on incomplete sen-\ntences. We leave the mitigation and automatic de-\ntection of such hallucinations to later versions of\nCHAT REPORT and future work.\n5.3 Which Backbone LLM is More Suitable?\nWe surprisingly ﬁnd that ChatGPT outperforms\nGPT-4 by a large margin in answer honesty. This\nis because GPT-4 tends to summarize information\nat a higher level and make unnecessary inferences\nwhen answering the questions, which leads to more\nhallucination in detail. Since we label an answer\nhallucinated even if there is only a minor error,\nmany GPT-4 answers are labeled as hallucinated. A\ncomparison between GPT-4 and ChatGPT answers\nis showcased in Appendix K.\nIt is also harder to identify GPT-4’s hallucination\nthan ChatGPT. When annotating hallucinations, we\nreach a Cohen’s Kappa of0.54 for ChatGPT but\nonly 0.21 for GPT-4. Sometimes, the highly ab-\nstractive and paraphrased nature of GPT-4 outputs\nmakes it hard even for our expert annotators to\nidentify hallucinations (though GPT-4 uses more\nutterances from the original reports as illustrated by\nthe ROUGE precision scores). Therefore, we use\nChatGPT as the backbone LLM for CHAT REPORT\n5.4 The Annotated Dataset\nOur human evaluation for hallucination results in\nan expert-annotated dataset with labels of whether\nthe answer is fully supported by the references. Hu-\nman evaluation of how attributable an answer is\nto its reference is expensive and time-consuming,\nfuture work may study how to automize this evalu-\nation process (Yue et al., 2023) and benchmark the\nalgorithm using our dataset.\n6 Conclusion and Future Work\nWe propose CHAT REPORT for automatic sustain-\nability report analysis and demonstrating its po-\ntential applications and implications. Our prompt\ndevelopment loop and annotated datasets about hal-\nlucination could positively transfer to other NLP\nand interdisciplinary research. CHAT REPORT is an\nopen-sourced ongoing project. Our future work\nwill focus on (1) enhancing the retrieval module to\nprovide more accurate contexts for generation, (2)\ndeveloping automatic attribution-checking tools to\nﬁght hallucination, and (3) migrating from OpenAI\nmodels to local LLM for more controllable output.\n26\nEthical Considerations\nGenerate False Information: Model hallucina-\ntion is still a signiﬁcant unresolved problem in NLP.\nCHAT REPORT also generates hallucinations and\nrequires some manual efforts to trace the answer.\nMoreover, due to the imperfect retrieval module,\nCHAT REPORT may ignore some relevant informa-\ntion. To avoid causing misinformation and disinfor-\nmation, on one hand, we disclaim on our website\nthat CHAT REPORT ’s outputs can only be used as\nreferences, and cannot be cited as evidence or fac-\ntual claims. On the other hand, we are experiment-\ning with different approaches to make the outputs\nmore accurate and will release better versions in\nthe future.\nBias towards Firm Perspective: A limitation of\nour approach is the inherent bias towards the ﬁrm’s\nperspective in the extracted information from cor-\nporate sustainability reports. As CHAT REPORT re-\nlies solely on the provided information as reported\nby the ﬁrm, it may struggle to provide unbiased\nand critical responses to certain questions. To mit-\nigate this limitation, we will explore methods to\nincorporate external perspectives and independent\nsources of information in future work. This can\nbe achieved by integrating data from third-party\nassessments, public opinion surveys, or expert eval-\nuations. By incorporating a broader range of per-\nspectives and data inputs, the analysis can provide\na more comprehensive and balanced understanding\nof corporate sustainability performance.\nChanging Behavior of OpenAI Models: Ope-\nnAI continues to update their model, leading to\na changing performance of CHAT REPORT ’s back-\nbone model (Chen et al., 2023). This may lead to\nless or more hallucination rates than we reported.\nIn future work, we will substitute the OpenAI\nclosed-source models with our own LLM check-\npoints, making the system more controllable and\nreproducible.\nHuman annotation: All human annotators are co-\nauthors of this paper, including climate and NLP\nresearchers who have full knowledge about the con-\ntext and utility of the collected data. We adhered\nstrictly to ethical guidelines, respecting the dignity,\nrights, safety, and well-being of all participants.\nThere are no data privacy issues or bias against\ncertain demographics with regard to the annotated\ndata.\nLicense of the Tool: We use Apache License 2.0\nto enable all stakeholders to use and adapt the Tool.\nBroader Implications\nSupporting Stakeholder Decision-making:\nStakeholders, including investors, customers, em-\nployees, and regulatory bodies, heavily rely on\ncorporate sustainability reports to make informed\ndecisions. The automated analysis provided by\nthe framework empowers stakeholders with valu-\nable insights into a company’s sustainability per-\nformance. Investors can use the extracted indica-\ntors to assess the environmental, social, and gov-\nernance (ESG) risks and opportunities Customers\ncan make more sustainable choices by considering\na company’s sustainability practices. Employees\ncan evaluate a company’s commitment to social\nand environmental responsibility. Regulators can\nuse the analysis results to monitor compliance with\nsustainability regulations.\nLLMs Disruptive Potential for the Rating\nIndustry:\nEmpowering all stakeholders with an automated\nanalysis framework could signiﬁcantly diminish\nthe need to rely on rating agencies for sustainability\nreport assessments. This shift in power from rating\nagencies to the general public and investors can\npotentially disrupt rating agencies’ business mod-\nels and challenge their long-standing dominance\nin sustainability reporting analysis: Rating agen-\ncies might start to focus on critical assessments of\nthe information disclosed by companies, and pro-\nvide external analyses of the strategies, rather than\nsummarizing the ﬁrm’s information.\nAcknowledgements\nThis paper has received funding from the Swiss\nNational Science Foundation (SNSF) under the\nproject ‘How sustainable is sustainable ﬁnance?\nImpact evaluation and automated greenwashing de-\ntection’ (Grant Agreement No. 100018_207800).\nReferences\nRohan Anil, Andrew M.

Nevertheless, we encourage\nfuture research and collaborative efforts to reﬁne\nand improve this scoring strategy, considering alter-\nnative perspectives and engaging a broader range\nof stakeholders.\nE The Eleven TCFD Questions\nOur domain experts rewrite the eleven TCFD rec-\nommendations (TCFD, 2017, 2021) into the fol-\nlowing eleven questions:\nGOVERNANCE\n32\n1. How does the company’s board oversee climate-related\nrisks and opportunities?\n2. What is the role of management in assessing and man-\naging climate-related risks and opportunities?\nSTRATEGY\n3. What are the most relevant climate-related risks and\nopportunities that the organization has identiﬁed over\nthe short, medium, and long term? Are risks clearly\nassociated with a horizon?\n4. How do climate-related risks and opportunities impact\nthe organization’s business strategy, economic and ﬁ-\nnancial performance, and ﬁnancial planning?\n5. How resilient is the organization’s strategy when con-\nsidering different climate-related scenarios, including a\n2°C target or lower scenario? How resilient is the orga-\nnization’s strategy when considering climate physical\nrisks?\nRISK MANAGEMENT\n6. What processes does the organization use to identify\nand assess climate-related risks?\n7. How does the organization manage climate-related\nrisks?\n8. How are the processes for identifying, assessing, and\nmanaging climate-related risks integrated into the orga-\nnization’s overall risk management?\nMETRICS AND TARGETS\n9. What metrics does the organization use to assess climate-\nrelated risks and opportunities? How do these metrics\nhelp ensure that performance aligns with its strategy and\nrisk management process?\n10. Does the organization disclose its Scope 1, Scope 2,\nand, if appropriate, Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG)\nemissions? What are the related risks, and do they differ\ndepending on the scope?\n11. What targets does the organization use to understand,\nquantify, and benchmark climate-related risks and op-\nportunities? How is the organization performing against\nthese targets?\nThese questions are designed to extract spe-\nciﬁc information related to oversight, management,\nrisks, opportunities, resilience, processes, metrics,\ndisclosure, and targets concerning climate-related\naspects within the organization.\nF Report Sampled for Hallucination\nAnalysis\nUsing a random seed of 43, we sampled 10 reports\nfor hallucination analysis: NYSE_WMT_2022.pdf,\nNYSE_SE_2021.pdf, NYSE_PNC_2021.pdf,\nNYSE_PLD_2016.pdf, NYSE_PBR_2016.pdf,\nNYSE_ITT_2019.pdf, NYSE_FTV_2022.pdf,\nNYSE_JPM_2021.pdf, NYSE_BV_2022.pdf,\nand NYSE_AIZ_2022.pdf. All these reports are\navailable in our GitHub.\nG Customized Analysis Examples\nThis section provides some illustrative examples of\npossible questions that can be answered by CHA -\nTREPORT based on the information available in the\nsustainability report of Sony and Shell, respectively.\nThe speciﬁc questions and the detailed answers are\nprovided in Table 4 and Table 5. Posing these ques-\ntions allows us to gain valuable insights from the\nsustainability reports beyond the TCFD require-\nments.\nWith the questions posed for Sony (Table 4),\nwe ﬁnd that with respect to the compatibility of\nSony’s transition plan with a 1.5 degrees pathway,\nthe report lacks sufﬁcient information to make a\ndetermination. While the report mentions scenario\nanalysis using 2°C and 4°C scenarios and Sony’s\ncommitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions,\nit does not provide concrete data or targets to assess\nthe plan’s compatibility with a 1.5 degrees pathway.\nWhile it mentions the establishment of annual plans\nby individual business units and sites, incorporating\nguiding principles and regular progress reviews, it\nlacks speciﬁc details. Assessing the ambition of\nSony’s transition plan is challenging due to the\nreport’s lack of speciﬁc targets and progress data\nrelated to its environmental goals. However, Sony\nsupports the TCFD and actively participates in the\nTCFD Consortium in Japan.\nWith the questions posed for Shell (Table 5), we\nobserve that the report contains qualitative informa-\ntion. Still, its adequacy in presenting a comprehen-\nsive view of the company’s sustainability efforts\nis uncertain. Moreover, we can identify instances\nof cheap talk, where unrelated topics like the war\nin Ukraine and the cost of living were mentioned,\npotentially diverting attention from the company’s\nsustainability performance. Regarding the com-\npany’s transition plan, the report lacks clarity on\nthe speciﬁc interim steps taken, only mentioning re-\nsponsible investments in the energy transition and\nscreening investments against multiple criteria. In-\nconsistencies were noted in the review of global tar-\ngets and the potential retirement of certain business\nKPI targets without clear implications provided.\nAdditionally, the report acknowledges that Shell’s\noperating plans cannot fully reﬂect their net-zero\nemissions and NCI targets, raising concerns about\nthe feasibility of their transition plan.\n33\nFY Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q5 Q6 Q7 Q8 Q9 Q10 Q11 Average # pages\n2014 0 0 20 40 40 30 40 20 20 40 70 29.09 436\n2015 0 20 20 30 50 20 40 20 20 30 40 26.36 529\n2016 50 60 40 20 30 30 40 50 30 40 60 40.90 510\n2017 10 30 20 10 40 20 40 40 0 60 60 30.00 561\n2018 0 10 20 30 20 40 40 20 20 40 40 25.45 317\n2019 60 60 40 40 40 70 60 70 30 50 50 51.81 214\n2020 60 60 40 80 70 50 10 50 20 60 50 58.18 170\n2021 60 60 40 70 70 60 70 80 30 60 60 60.00 199\n2022 70 60 40 60 60 60 70 60 30 60 50 56.36 164\nTable 3: SONY Scores on TCFD-conformity\nH TCFD Conformity Analysis Examples\nThe output of the TCFD analysis is structured ac-\ncording to the eleven questions from the TCFD\nreport. This section provides the analysis summary\nof the corporate sustainability reports of JP Morgan\nChase in 2015 and 2021, Shell in 2022, and UBS in\n2022. For each of the eleven questions, we report\nthe question itself, the answer to the question, and\nthe analysis of the disclosed content, which gives\nthe score. The total score of the report is calculated\nas the average over all eleven scores.\nFor JP Morgan Chase, CHAT REPORT gives an\naverage score of zero for the year 2015 (Ap-\npendix H.1, which is reassuring since the TCFD\nrecommendations were not yet published and there\nis almost no environmental information in JP Mor-\ngan’s report. However, for the year 2021 (Ap-\npendix H.2), the score for JP Morgan reached\nmore than 61, clearly indicating the adoption of\nTCFD guidelines in their climate-related disclo-\nsure. In Appendix H.3, we observe that while Shell\nacknowledges the signiﬁcance of climate-related\nrisks and opportunities, CHAT REPORT argues that\nquestion ﬁve of the TCFD guidelines is not fully\naddressed by the report. CHAT REPORT criticizes\nthe lack of speciﬁc details on how the organiza-\ntion’s strategy would adapt to the potential impact\nof climate-related issues on ﬁnancial performance\nunder different climate-related scenarios. More-\nover, the report provides no information on the\nresilience of Shell’s strategy when facing physi-\ncal climate risks. Overall, the report’s disclosure\non this TCFD recommendation point is deemed\ninsufﬁcient and therefore obtains a low score.\nInspecting UBS in Appendix H.4 as another ex-\nample, we ﬁnd that for question four of the TCFD\nreport, the sustainability report provides some high-\nquality information (score of 90). In particular, the\nreport provides a comprehensive overview of the\nimpact of climate-related issues across various as-\npects, such as products and services, supply chain,\nadaptation and mitigation activities, and access to\ncapital, among others. The report demonstrates a\nholistic understanding of the interconnectedness\nof these factors and their inﬂuence on the organi-\nzation’s long-term value creation. Nevertheless,\nCHAT REPORT argues that the report falls short in\nproviding speciﬁc details on greenhouse gas emis-\nsions targets and concrete actions to reduce emis-\nsions in their operations and value chain or support\nthe transition to a low-carbon future.\nH.1 JP Morgan Chase 2015\nGovernance:\nQ1: How does the company’s board oversee\nclimate-related risks and opportunities?\nA1: The report does not provide speciﬁc informa-\ntion on how the company’s board oversees climate-\nrelated risks and opportunities. It only mentions\nthat the board is responsible for governance issues\nwithin the business.\nAnalysis1: The sustainability report does not pro-\nvide any information on how the company’s board\noversees climate-related risks and opportunities.\nThe report only contains vague and irrelevant infor-\nmation that does not meet any of the requirements\nfor high-quality disclosure pertaining to the critical\nelement. The report does not discuss the processes\nand frequency by which the board and/or board\ncommittees are informed about climate-related is-\nsues, whether the board and/or board committees\nconsider climate-related issues when reviewing and\nguiding strategy, major plans of action, risk man-\nagement policies, annual budgets, and business\nplans, or how the board monitors and oversees\nprogress against goals and targets for addressing\nclimate-related issues. As a result, the report re-\nceives a score of 0.\nScore1: 0\n34\nQuestion:\"Is the transition plan compatible with a 1.5 de-\ngrees pathway, i.e., Paris-aligned pathway?\"\nAnswer:The report does not provide sufﬁcient information\nto determine if Sony’s transition plan is compatible with a\n1.5 degrees pathway. The report only mentions scenario anal-\nysis using 2°C and 4°C scenarios, and Sony’s commitment\nto reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, there is no\nconcrete data or targets provided to assess the compatibility\nof Sony’s transition plan with a 1.5 degrees pathway.\nPages:[112, 98, 108]\nQuestion:\"What are the policies and activities that the com-\npany plans to implement in the next three years, i.e., short\nterm, to implement its transition plan?\"\nAnswer:Sony’s sustainability report does not provide clear\nand speciﬁc policies and activities that the company plans to\nimplement in the next 3 years to implement its transition plan.\nThe report only mentions that individual business units and\nsites establish and implement their own annual plans, incorpo-\nrating essential elements of guiding principles established by\nthe headquarters, and progress on the implementation of these\nbusiness plans is reviewed regularly by a committee. However,\nthe report lacks concrete details on the speciﬁc policies and\nactivities that will be implemented in the short term.\nPages:[107]\nQuestion:\"Does the company’s transition plan lack ambition?\nWhat do you think?\"\nAnswer:The report does not provide sufﬁcient information\nto determine whether Sony’s transition plan lacks ambition.\nWhile the report mentions Sony’s Road to Zero environmental\nplan, it does not provide speciﬁc details on the plan’s targets\nor how it will achieve them. Additionally, the report lacks\nconcrete data on Sony’s progress towards its environmental\ngoals, making it difﬁcult to assess the ambition of its transition\nplan.\nPages:[113, 110]\nQuestion:\"Does the company support the TCFD?\"\nAnswer:Yes, Sony Corporation supports the TCFD and par-\nticipates in the TCFD Consortium in Japan to facilitate im-\nplementation and discussion among companies and ﬁnancial\ninstitutions that endorse the TCFD Recommendations. Sony\nalso disclosed climate-related information in accordance with\nthe TCFD Recommendations.\nPages:[113, 165, 166, 111]\nTable 4: User-speciﬁc questions to a corporate sustain-\nability report: Sony FY2020\nQ2: What is the role of management in assessing\nand managing climate-related risks and opportuni-\nties?\nA2: The report does not provide a clear answer on\nthe role of management in assessing and manag-\ning climate-related risks and opportunities. There\nare no speciﬁc mentions of climate-related risks\nand opportunities in the report, and the content\nprovided is not relevant to the question.\nAnalysis2: The given disclosure does not provide\nany information on the role of management in as-\nsessing and managing climate-related risks and op-\nportunities. The report only contains general infor-\nmation about the organization’s governance struc-\nture and its initiatives related to economic growth\nand social issues. The report does not mention any\nQuestion:\"What is the level of cheap talk in the report?\"\nAnswer: The report contains some qualitative information,\nbut it is not clear whether it is sufﬁcient to provide a complete\npicture of the company’s sustainability efforts. The report\nalso includes some cheap talk, such as mentioning topical\nissues like the war in Ukraine and the cost of living, which\nmay not be directly related to the company’s sustainability\nperformance.\nPages:[11]\nQuestion:\"What are the interim steps that the company takes\nto implement its transition plan?\"\nAnswer:Shell’s sustainability report does not provide clear\ninformation on the interim steps taken to implement its transi-\ntion plan. The report only mentions that the company invests\nresponsibly in the energy transition and screens its investments\nagainst multiple criteria. However, it is unclear what speciﬁc\nactions the company takes to transition to net-zero emissions.\nPages:[63]\nQuestion: \"What are possible inconsistencies in the ﬁrm’s\ntransition plan?\"\nAnswer:The report mentions that existing global targets are\nunder review, and some business KPI targets may be retired as\npart of normal strategy evolution. However, it is unclear what\nspeciﬁc targets are being reviewed and what the implications\nof retiring them would be. Additionally, the report states\nthat Shell’s operating plans cannot reﬂect their 2050 net-zero\nemissions target and 2035 NCI target, which raises questions\nabout the feasibility of their transition plan.\nPages:[88]\nQuestion:\"In which technologies will the company invest in\nthe next few years?\"\nAnswer:Shell plans to invest in low-carbon energy solutions\nsuch as biofuels, hydrogen, charging for electric vehicles,\nwind, and solar power. They invested $8.2 billion in low-\ncarbon energy and non-energy products, around a third of\ntheir total cash capital expenditure of $25 billion in 2022.\nThey also won bids with their partners to build four offshore\nwind farms in the Netherlands, the UK, and the USA, and\nextended their onshore wind activities into Australia and the\nPhilippines. They acquired Indian solar developer Spring\nEnergy and completed the acquisition of Nature Energy of\nDenmark, which is Europe’s biggest producer of renewable\nnatural gas made from agricultural, industrial, and household\nwaste.\nPages:[24, 33, 3, 25]\nTable 5: User-speciﬁc questions to a corporate sustain-\nability report: Shell FY2022\nspeciﬁc management-level positions or committees\nresponsible for climate-related issues, nor does it\ndescribe any processes by which management is\ninformed about climate-related issues.

Its general structure - covering governance,\nstrategy, risk management, and metrics and targets\n- emerges as the premier candidate of voluntary re-\nporting frameworks to be adopted for regulatory\nreporting and international standards 8. The pur-\npose of the TCFD is to provide a voluntary report-\ning framework to encourage companies to disclose\ninformation on climate-related risks and opportu-\nnities. This information is crucial for stakehold-\ners and investors to make informed decisions that\naccount for climate-related risks. Companies are\nasked to disclose this information in their annual\nreports and ﬁnancial ﬁlings, within their sustain-\nability reports, or as stand-alone documents. To\ndate, most companies have included the informa-\ntion as part of their sustainability reports, due to no\nor limited assurance and legal liability concerns if\nit was included in the annual reports.
