Spatially explicit models allow managers to better\nunderstand certain ecosystem processes, but they require large\namounts of data in comparison to models that assume homoge-\nneous space. One example of these additional requirements is that\nthese models require an initial spatial allocation of functional\ngroup biomass or abundance. It is not straightforward to develop\nbiomass distribution grids due to the lack of comprehensive stock\nassessments outside a handful of commercially valued species and\nthere is a particular lack of spatial distribution data from\ninternational waters. In most cases, this limits the development\nof ecosystem models to those areas that are rich in fisheries\nindependent data. Efforts have been made to extrapolate data\nfrom limited spatial areas to larger scales using a variety of\nmethods including interpolation over arbitrarily assigned regions\n[2] and similarity matrices [3]. Generalized additive modeling\noffers an objective way to predict abundance or biomass according\nto the known ecology of the animals over broad geographic areas.\nGeneralized additive models (GAMs) [4] are a semi-parametric\napproach to predicting non-linear responses to a suite of predictor\nvariables. In general, GAMs can be used to identify optimal\nconditions for a given species using environmental variables (e.g.,\ndepth and temperature) in order to predict the likelihood that a\ngiven species would inhabit a particular environment, or their\nabundance [5,6,7,8]. The outputs of these models are often used to\ninterpolate species distributions at high resolution within coarsely\nsampled areas [9,5,7]. Model testing and sensitivity analysis can\nalso help identify influential environmental variables and their\ncorresponding range of influence [9,5]. In comparative studies,\nGAMs have often been shown to perform as well or better than\nother types of predictive models based on environmental\nconditions [8,10,11]. Despite their acknowledgment as a proven\ntool for ecological analyses, albeit with some caveats [11], few\nstudies, have applied the method to make predictions outside of a\nsampled area.\nFisheries independent sampling efforts typically result in many\nzero observations for any given species, particularly in surveys that\ncover a broad range of habitats or depths. To deal with this\nproblem a number of approaches have been developed to fit these\ntypes of data including lognormal delta distributions [12,13], delta\nmethod approximation of variance [14], and zero inflated\ndistributions [15,16]. All of these methods can be applied to\neither generalized linear models, or generalized additive models.\nThe latter of the two allows for greater flexibility in the model\nfitting. Despite these advanced methods dealing with zero\ninflation, Warton (2005) [17] found that in most cases a negative\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 May 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e64458\nbinomial was sufficient to model data with many zeros. In this\npaper we utilized a negative binomial GAM to predict the relative\nabundance of functional groups across shelf areas of the entire\nGulf of Mexico (GoM) including Mexican and Cuban waters and\nareas where fisheries independent surveys do not exist, based on\nenvironmental and habitat predictors.\nThe purpose of this study was to find a single parsimonious\nframework to predict the distribution of multiple functional groups\nwithin an ecosystem. This framework can then be utilized in the\nobjective distribution of relative abundance for a spatially explicit\nAtlantis ecosystem model of the GoM (Atlantis-GoM) in prepa-\nration for NOAA’s Integrated Ecosystem Assessment and other\napplications (Atlantis; [18,19]). In order to provide better spatial\nmanagement of fisheries, a better understanding of the ecosystem-\nwide influences on that stock requires modeling of the entire\necosystem and not just those parts that are adequately sampled.\nWe validate the model by predicting the distribution of pink\nshrimp (Farfantepenaeus duroarum ) throughout the Gulf of Mexico\nand compare the model performance of both the aggregated\nresults used in ecosystem models and the high-resolution gridded\nvalues taken directly from the GAM. While numerous species were\nconsidered in the model fitting, only the summer abundance of\npink shrimp is illustrated here. Pink shrimp were chosen as an\nexample species because they were well represented in the\navailable observational data set used in model training and their\ndistribution is strongly correlated with environmental and habitat\npredictor variables.\nMethods\nStudy Area\nThe Gulf of Mexico (GoM) is one of the world’s 64 Large\nMarine Ecosystems [20]. This ecosystem spans tropical and\nsubtropical climates and is enveloped by the economic exclusive\nzones (EEZ) of the United States, Mexico, and Cuba. The EEZ of\nthe United States alone supports 25 million recreational fishing\ntrips [21] and a commercial fisheries harvest in excess of one\nmillion tonnes per year [22]. Gulf shrimp remain one of the most\nimportant fisheries in the region with combined landings value of\n368 million dollars [23]. In this article, we estimate the abundance\nand spatial distribution of 40 functional groups (groups of species\naggregated according to niche similarities). The single-species\nfunctional group of pink shrimp is illustrated here in detail as a\ncase study. The range of pink shrimp extends through the entire\nGoM coastal waters [24]. Nearly 94% of the pink shrimp\nharvested in the GoM are landed on the west coast of Florida\n[23] where they are particularly abundant. Known ‘‘hot spots’’ for\npink shrimp include the area surrounding the Dry Tortugas as well\nas the eastern coast of the Golfo de Campeche (Figure 1). The\nhighest adult abundance is found between 9 and 44 m of water\n[25,26].\nSEAMAP Groundfish survey\nThe Southeast Area Monitoring and Assessment Program\n(SEAMAP) is a multiagency fisheries independent data collection\nprogram coordinated by the Gulf States Marine Fisheries\nCommission [27]. Groundfish surveys are conducted on an\nannual, and sometimes seasonal, basis using a 40-ft otter trawl\nthroughout the northern GoM. The general area surveyed by\nSEAMAP includes most the continental shelf up to 200 m depth,\nbut only within the territorial waters of the United States in the\nnorthern Gulf of Mexico (Figure 1). Survey data was extracted\nfrom the public SEAMAP database [28] and aggregated by\nfunctional groups. Sampling effort was estimated as the total area\nswept of each SEAMAP tow using the Euclidean distance between\nstart and end points and an assumed 40-ft trawling width.\nEnvironmental Conditions\nPredictor variables included in the model were surface\nchlorophyll a (chl a), sediment type, bottom dissolved oxygen\n(DO), bottom temperature, and depth (Table 1). These variables\nwere chosen due to the wide spatial coverage throughout the Gulf\nof Mexico. Sediment type was divided into the following\ncategories: mud, sand, gravel, and rock. A 0.1\n0 gridded map of\nseasonal environmental parameters was made for each season\n(Winter: Jan-Mar, Spring: Apr-Jun, Summer: Jul-Aug, Fall: Sep-\nDec) with data collected from the following sources. Measure-\nments of bottom temperature and DO at the maximum depth\nrecorded for each grid point were extracted for each season from\nthe National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) regional\nclimatology database [29]. Surface chl a measurements were\nobtained by averaging the seasonal composites of MODIS – Terra\nsatellite measurements and the NASA Ocean Biogeochemical\nModel from 2005–2010 accessed through the GIOVANNI portal\n(http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/Giovanni/overview/index.html). A\ncontinuous raster of bathymetry was derived from the\nSRTM30_PLUS global bathymetry grid [30], which was accessed\nfrom the Gulf of Mexico Coastal Ocean Observing System\n(gcoos.tamu.edu). The best available data on bottom sediment\ntype, dbSEABED2006 [31,32] does not provide complete\ncoverage for the entire Gulf of Mexico, although the area sampled\nby SEAMAP has substantial coverage. A nearest neighbor\nfunction was executed on a 0.1\n0 grid using the natural neighbor\nfunction in GIS v10.0 [33] for those grid points lacking any\nsediment data. Incomplete and low resolution environmental data\nwas subjected to a spline interpolation using the same grid and\nGIS software in order to provide a contiguous surface from which\nto make model predictions. The seasonal environmental condi-\ntions grid was then overlaid with the SEAMAP starting locations\nfor a given season. These environmental grids were used both in\nthe fitting of the model and in and in predicting abundance\ndistributions for unsampled areas.\nModel description\nA GAM approach was used to predict relative abundance of\nAtlantis-GoM functional groups in shelf areas across the entire\nGulf of Mexico based on estimates of abundance and regional\noceanographic conditions occurring at SEAMAP trawl locations.\nDue to the large number of zero observations and the need for a\nsingle parsimonious model to make predictions for a large number\nof functional groups, a GAM was developed using a negative\nbinomial distribution with an offset for effort [15]. Prior to the\nfitting of the final model, the data was randomly split into training\nand test sets: 2/3 of the data was for training and 1/3 for model\nvalidation. Once validated, the full set of pink shrimp summer\nabundance data was then used to fit the model and make the final\npredictions for the ‘summer’ season. All models were fit using the\n‘mgcv’ package in the R version 2.14.0 environment [34] following\nthe equation:\ng(g)~ss(depth)zs(chla)zs(temp)zs(oxygen)\nzfactor(sedimenttype)zoffset(g(effort))\nwhere g represents the expected abundance resulting from the\ngeneralization of the predictor terms according to the link function\ng. The abundance data was modeled using a negative binomial\ndistribution with a log link function, including an offset, with\nUse of GAMs in Ecosystem Models\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 May 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e64458\nequivalent link function, to allow for variations in effort. Functions\nis a thin plate regression spline fit to a given environmental\nparameter. The smoothness selection was fit using a spline-based\npenalized likelihood estimation. Theta parameters and weighted\npenalties were determined by Un-Biased Risk Estimator (UBRE)\nwhich is similar to an AIC rescaled [34]. Estimation of the theta\nparameter was limited to a range of 1–10. An extra penalty was\napplied to each parameter as the smoothing parameter ap-\nproached zero, allowing the complete removal of a term from the\nmodel when the smoothing parameter is equal to zero. This extra\npenalty allows for partially automated model selection and is\nespecially useful given the models broad application to numerous\nfunctional groups.\nThe initial training model fits were evaluated by analyzing the\ntotal deviance explained and UBRE score. Model performance\nwas evaluated by predicting the abundance at each of the data\npoints in the test data set, given the environmental conditions at\nthat point. The predictions were then compared to the observed\nvalues at each respective point. Plots of the predicted vs. observed\nabundance were made for each group, and a least squares\nregression was used to evaluate any trends. Once the predictions of\nthe training/test model were compared and deemed suitable for\nanalysis, the entire data set was then used to predict abundance\nfrom the environmental conditions within each 0.1\n0 grid cell for\ndepths up to 200 m. To illustrate the usefulness of this method as a\nway of initializing spatially explicit ecological models, the results of\nthe pink shrimp distributions were averaged according to the\nAtlantis-GoM spatial polygons and displayed with their associated\n95% confidence intervals.\nResults\nFor pink shrimp, the model described 45.5% (UBRE = 1.6) of\nthe deviance. The models for the remaining functional groups\ndescribed between 10% and 83% of the deviance with a median\nvalue of 33.6% (Table S1 in File S1). All of the functional groups\nobserved in SEAMAP trawls also had a positive slope of the\nFigure 1.

All of the continuous\npredictors were found to have a smoothing term significantly\ndifferent from zero (p,0.001) and thus contributed to the model\nfit for pink shrimp. This was also true for most demersal\ninvertebrate groups. However, the significance of the predictors\nfrom other groups not commonly selected by a benthic trawl\nvaried widely.\nIndividual parameter values were in general agreement with the\nhabitat suitability index model derived by Mulholland (1984) [24].\nMulholland reports catches of shrimp over a wide range of\ntemperatures (5u–38uC) with the highest density of catch from 20–\n38uC. The curve fit to the modeled distribution found the highest\nabundance to be in the range of 18–32uC (Figure 2). Values higher\nthan 38uC likely reflect the error associated with the interpolation\nof environmental data. Temperatures lower than 15uC had a\nnegative effect on the expected abundance.\nMulholland [24] also predicts sandy-silt and silty-sand to be the\nsediment types with the highest suitability for pink shrimp,\nfollowed by hard bottom. The lowest suitability was in soft\nbottom. The modeled data predicted significantly greater densities\nof shrimp on sand and rock habitats (p,0.05; Figure 3). Depth\nonly had a slight positive effect on the estimated abundance up to\n30–40 m; any depth greater than this had a negative effect on the\nestimated abundance. Chlorophylla concentrations were inversely\ncorrelated to pink shrimp abundance for values up to 15 mg/m\n3 at\nwhich point the excepted abundance dropped sharply. The\ninfluence of dissolved oxygen did not fluctuate greatly across the\nrange of values between 2.0–4.5 mL/L. Dissolved oxygen values\ngreater than 6 had a positive effect on the model, but were not\ncommon in the seasonal averages of the environmental conditions.\nTherefore, the fitted model reflects previous research pertaining to\nthe habitat preference for pink shrimp with regard to temperature\nand sediment type and introduces some additional suitability\nparameters.\nUsing the test set of SEAMAP data, the ability of the model to\npredict the response was evaluated. In general, the model\npredicted a higher mean abundance for those stations where high\nabundances were observed (Figure 4). Although less than ideal,\nideal being equivalent 1:1 slope, the difference captures the\ngeneral trend of the data. In every functional group assessed using\nthis model, the slope of the least square line was greater than zero.\nThe model predictions were then aggregated by polygon and\ncompared to the mean abundance occurring within those polygons\nwith fisheries independent data. The aggregated predictions were\nin better agreement with the observed data with a normal\ndistribution of residuals around the least square line. However, like\nthe point estimates, the intercept was greater than zero, and may\nindicate an overestimation of abundances close to zero.\nThe spatial distribution of the gridded values, predict high\nabundance along the entire mid-depth portion of the West Florida\nShelf, and some additional hotspots near the Dry Tortugas,\nLouisiana-Texas border, Texas-Mexico border, and on the north-\nwestern Campeche Bank (Figure 5). The highest abundance was\nfound in the areas north of the Florida Keys/Dry Tortugas with\nabundances approaching 1.2 million shrimp per grid cell. Abun-\ndances near the Florida panhandle were two orders of magnitude\nless than those found near the Florida Keys. The hotspots around\nthe Texas-Mexico border and Campeche Bank were a similar\norder of magnitude less than those near the Dry Tortugas\nalthough those distributions were patchy and smaller in area.\nThe Atlantis-GoM polygon spatial distributions reflect the\ngeneral distribution of pink shrimp in the 0.1\n0 gridded results\n(Figure 5,6). Highest abundance occurs at mid depth over the\nWest Florida Shelf and Dry Tortugas, and the nearshore polygons\nalong the western gulf. The comparison of the observed to\npredicted values of the aggregated polygons were in better\nagreement than the higher resolution gridded values (Figure 4).\nThe observed mean of those polygons with SEAMAP data (3.52)\nwas found to be significantly different from the predicted mean\n(6.62) through a paired t-test (t = 3.90, p = 0.0002). The 95%\nconfidence intervals were inversely related to the mean abun-\ndance, and ranged between 0 and 1.65 on a log scale for the\nFigure 2.

In this paper we extend the use of the GAM\napproach to make predictions of abundance based on the\nenvironmental conditions beyond the sampling domain of the\ndata used to fit the model. We also show how the data derived in\nthis model will be incorporated into the Gulf of Mexico Atlantis\necosystem model in Figure 6. The absolute predictions for\nindividual functional groups may not be precise using the limited\nabundance data set from SEAMAP employed here. Also, the\nenvironmental data used in making predictions is averaged over\ntime and space, missing environmental extremes that may have\nsignificant influence on species distributions. Future studies might\ntest environmental data with a higher temporal resolution, given\nthe data is available. Also, the presence of spatial autocorrelation\nFigure 4.

In our case we considered this approach\nimpractical due to data scarcity and the application of the modeled\nresults to a course resolution ecosystem model.\nThe high degree of correlation between model results and the\nvalidation data set indicates that we can reliably predict qualitative\ndifferences between low- and high-biomass regions, especially in\nterms of relative abundance. Regardless of the degree of precision\nprovided by this model, the results offer a vast improvement over\nthe assumption of a homogenous distribution of a population\ncommonly used in stock assessments. Further, when aggregated to\nthe level used for spatially explicit ecosystem models, the model\nprovides a better fit to the observed data points. Therefore, the\ninformation supplied by this modelling framework can be used to\ninitialize the spatial distribution of species for dynamic ecosystem\nmodels whose spatial distributions will settle to a new, but related,\nequilibrium at run-time. This proof of concept application can be\nimproved as additional CPUE and environmental data become\navailable. Additional data could be incorporated from fisheries-\ndependent data such as spatially referenced commercial catch\nstatistics and observer data. Coupling these models with spatially\nexplicit estimations of pressures can ultimately determine the\nabsolute contributions of these predictors on species abundance in\nlieu of pressure.\nWe demonstrated the utility of the model by predicting areas of\nhigh abundance of pink shrimp near the historical fishing areas\nwhere no observational abundance data was available. The model\nresults were also in general agreement with previous research\nregarding the suitability of each parameter used. Thus the\nextension of this model to the entirety of the southern Gulf of\nMexico should provide reasonable estimates of abundance. It\nshould be noted that although pink shrimp occur throughout the\nGulf of Mexico, one would expect the species composition of other\ngroups of animals to vary with latitude. While the use of\nmultispecies functional groups occupying similar niches does\nprovide some added flexibility to the final predictions, the\ninclusion of a latitude parameter could explicitly differentiate\nthese variations in species abundance. Unfortunately, no data is\navailable for latitudes south of Texas-Mexico border to the west,\nand south of Florida to the east. Thus, including this terms will\nlimit the predictive capabilities to only those latitudes where data\nexist, undermining the purpose of the model.\nWhile the magnitude of abundance from a benthic trawl may be\nexpected to reflect the absolute abundance of pink shrimp,\nestimating the abundance of other functional groups, particularly\nnon-demersal and non-benthic species using the same gear will be\nsubject to a catchability bias. There was adequate data to predict\nthe distributions of 40 of the 90 Atlantis-GoM functional groups.\nThose groups which are less vulnerable to benthic trawling gear,\nsuch as large sharks, greater amberjack, king mackerel, spanish\nmackerel, and squid, did not show a close relationship between\nobserved and predicted abundance values (Figure S1 in File S1).\nAbundance estimates for these functional groups may be\nunreliable until additional abundance data from other sampling\ngear types can be incorporated into the training data set.\nAbundance was better predicted for slower moving, smaller,\nmainly demersal species that would be selected by a benthic\ntrawler, such as benthic grazers, bivalves, blue crab, flatfish, pink\nshrimp, and sessile filter feeders. It is worth re-iterating that\npredictions of these functional groups were limited by the depth\nrange sampled by SEAMAP trawling. For this reason, the current\napplication should only be used to set distributions on the\ncontinental shelf. However, the substitution of a general set of\npredictors suitable to the pelagic or deepwater environments\nshould yield plausible results.\nDespite the positive relationship between the predicted and\nobserved values, none of the least squares lines approached a slope\nof one. Therefore, the model tends to overestimate abundance\nwhere no catch was observed. However, the model did manage to\nconsistently detect a lowered combined abundance at sites where\nno catch was observed. This bias is likely related to the fact that\nthese simple environmental indices are not satisfactory to explain a\nportion of the variability in the distribution of these functional\ngroups. The model tends to fail at low population densities that\nmay be heavily influenced by minute differences in oceanographic\nconditions, patchiness, or other unexplained variability. These\ndifferences will not be captured by the regional/seasonal\nenvironmental data used in this study. The environmental\nvariables chosen for this study were done so for their wide spatial\ndistribution spanning the entire modelling domain. Given this\ncaveat, these high resolution errors become less important when\nused to initialize a course resolution model such as the Atlantis-\nGoM; where polygons are on the order of thousands of square\nkilometers (Figure 6). The final gridded spatial distributions for all\n40 functional groups can be found in Figure S2 in File S1.\nAggregating the results to a courser resolution, i.e. the Atlantis-\nGoM polygons, allows us to average out the variance, as the large\npolygons will tend to be closer to the global average. The general\ndistribution of pink shrimp is adequately represented by the\nAtlantis-GoM polygons (Figures 5, 6). This aggregation provided a\nbetter fit to the observational data than the individual points\n(Figure 4). The significant differences detected between the overall\npolygon means suggests, as in the gridded model, that we may still\nbe slightly overestimating the total abundance across the entire\nsystem. As stated before, this bias may be related to the fact that\nwe are fitting our model to seasonal data. The same reasoning for\nthe bias in the gridded values also applies here. GAMs require\nmany degrees of freedom and introduce a tradeoff between\nincluding addition degrees of freedom by aggregating data across\nseasons or spatial scales, or more highly resolved data with low\npredictive power to which we chose the prior.\nIn conclusion, this paper notes the utility of GAMs beyond the\ncommon applications of identifying influential environmental\nvariables and interpolating abundance and biomass within\nsampling regions. For applications like initializing biomass\ndistributions in spatial ecosystem models, where wide spatial and\ntaxonomic coverage is desirable but the benefit of high precision\nestimates is lost at run-time, these statistical approaches hold\nunrealized potential.\nSupporting Information\nFile S1 Table S1, Summary of individual model performance in\nterms of deviation explained for every Atlantis-GOM functional\ngroup observed during SEAMAP sampling from 2005–2010.\nFigure S1, Combined model fits of the observed (x-axis) versus\npredicted (y-axis) values of data for all 40 functional groups\nestimated from this model.
