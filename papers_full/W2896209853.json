Introduction\n The linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) is an inductive transducer that is widely \napplied in instrumentation and measurement systems.  The LVDT provides the behavior \nin terms of high resolution, high linearity, and durability, and is employed for measuring \nthe displacement.  The applications of the LVDT can be found in the fields of industries, \nmilitary, vehicles, structural health monitoring, and scientific and medical equipment for the \nmeasurement of position, level, force, flow, and pressure. (1–6)  The L VDT consists of a primary \nwinding and two secondary windings connected in series with opposite directions similar \nto a transformer.  The moving core of the LVDT is used for sensing the displacement.  The \noutput signal of the LVDT is subtracted between the two secondary windings in the form \nof amplitude modulation with suppressed carrier (AMSC).  Previously, the phase-sensitive \n2172 Sensors and Materials , Vol. 30, No. 10 (2018)\ndemodulator formed by a diode and a low-pass filter was used to demodulate the displacement \nsignal from the LVDT signal.  The disadvantage of this method is that the large error due to \nthe threshold voltage of the diode occurs. (1)  To overcome this error, the analog multiplier and \nlow-pass filter formed as the synchronous demodulator can demodulate the displacement \nsignal without a diode in the signal path.  The use of a low-pass filter in traditional approaches \ndeteriorates the response time and stability of the demodulator.  Recently, the use of a sample-\nand-hold circuit (SHC) instead of the analog multiplier and low-pass filter in the synchronous \ndemodulator is more attracted. (7–12)  The SHC provides the transfer characteristic in terms \nof the ‘sinc’ function, the behavior of which is close to an ideal low-pass filter. (13)  Th us, the \nuse of the SHC in the synchronous demodulator can remove the high-frequency components \nof the LVDT signal to achieve the displacement signal without disturbing the performance of \nthe demodulator.  The reference frequency used for the synchronous demodulators mentioned \nabove is provided by the excitation signal.  Practically, the phase shift between the excitation \nsignal and the LVDT signal occurs owing to the structure of the LVDT.  This phase shift \ncauses the error in the demodulated signal.  In addition, the output signal of the LVDT can \nalso be interfered by the variation in ambient temperature.  The aforementioned approaches \nare achieved only with the demodulator without temperature compensation.  Therefore, the \napplications of the LVDT for a high-temperature environment are avoided.  There are two \nrecent approaches using dual secondary windings in the LVDT structure for the compensation \nof the temperature effect. (14,15)  Unfortunately, both approaches require a specific design of the \nLVDT structure; such approaches are unsuitable for commercial purposes.  Alternately, the \napproach based on the ratiometric technique has been proposed. (16)  This approach requires the \nanalog multiplier, the analog divider, and the synchronous demodulator, which deteriorates the \nresponse time and system stability.  In addition, the aforementioned approaches are unsuitable \nfor embedded systems and smart sensors used in a smart factory owing to the complicated \ntopology of the signal conditioner.  In this paper, the proposed feedback technique is introduced \nfor the minimization of the temperature effect.  The feedback signal is provided by the sum \nof two secondary winding signals, which obtains a constant amplitude signal.  The proposed \nfeedback scheme provides a proportional-plus-integral control action to reduce the error due to \nthe ambient temperature variation.  Moreover, the error caused by the phase shift is prevented \nbecause the reference frequency is directly achieved from the secondary winding signals.  The \nproposed scheme is attractive in terms of simple configuration and low cost.\n2. Circuit Description\n The simplified diagram of the LVDT is depicted in the dash-line block of Fig. 1(a).  The \nLVDT output signal is obtained from the difference between two secondary winding signals.  \nIf the signal vex = VPsinωext is applied to the primary winding, where ωex = 2πfex and fex is the \nexcitation frequency, then the two secondary winding signals vS1 and vS2 can be written as \n vS1 = KLlC(1 + l\nlC\n)(1 − α∆T )VP sin(ω ext + φS ),  (1a)\nSensors and Materials , Vol. 30, No. 10 (2018) 2173\n vS2 = KLlC(1 − l\nlC\n)(1 − α∆T )VP sin(ω ext + φS ),  (1b)\nwhere KL is the sensitivity of the LVDT, lC is the center position of the LVDT, l is the core \nposition deviating from the center position, α i s  t h e  t e m p e r a t u r e  c o e f f i c i e n t ,  ΔT is the \ntemperature deviation from the room temperature of 25 °C, and ϕS denotes the phase shift \nbetween the primary winding signal and the secondary winding signals.  The LVDT output \nsignal vd is the difference between the two secondary winding signals vS1 and v S2 and can be \nexpressed as\n vd = vS1 − vS2 = 2KLl(1 − α∆T )VP sin(ω ext + φS ).  (2)\n It can be seen that the amplitude of the LVDT signal vd in Eq. (2) is proportional to the core \nposition l and the variation in ambient temperature, ΔT.  From Fig. 1(a), the sum voltage vsum can \nbe stated as\n vsum = −(vS1 + vS2) = −KS (1 − α∆T)VP sin(ω ext + φS ),  (3)\nwhere KS = 2KLlC.  Note that the signals vd and vsum are 180° out of phase.  The signal vsum in Eq. (3) \nis directly proportional to the change in ambient temperature without the core displacement l.  \nFig. 1.

The operation of the proposed technique is based on the assumption that the period of the \nexcitation frequency is much less than the change in ambient temperature.  The peak-amplitude \nfinder provides the control signal for two SHCs to sample the positive-peak amplitudes of the \nsignals vsum and vd to the signal va and the displacement signal v dl, respectively.  The voltage va \nis attenuated by the attenuator Kf to provide the signal v f as the feedback signal.  From Fig. 1(a), \nthe reference voltage vref and the voltage vf are provided for the difference and sum to obtain the \nsignal vm for the voltage-controlled amplifier Amul.  For steady-state operation, the voltage vf is \nforced to equal the reference voltage vref.  The signal vsin is scaled by the signal vm to provide \nthe excitation signal vex for the L VDT.  The signal verr is the difference between the signals vref \nand vf, which is processed by the block diagram K1, to add with the reference voltage vref.  The \nrelationship of the signals vm, vref, and vf can be expressed as\n vm = vre f + K1(vre f − vf ).  (4)\n From Fig. 1(a), the signal vsin is provided with constant amplitude and frequency.  The \ndiagram in Fig. 1(a) with the temperature effect can be simplified as shown in Fig. 1(b), where \nKm is the voltage gain of the voltage-controlled amplifier Amul and α a = αK S.  The signal va \nagainst the reference voltage vref and the variation in ambient temperature Δ T can be stated as\n va = KmKS (1 + K1)\n1 + K1Kf KmKS\nvre f − α a\n1 + K1Kf KmKS\n∆T.  (5)\nIf the gain Kf in Eq. (5) is assigned to equal 1/KmKS , then the signal va can be expressed as\n va = KmKS vre f − α a\n1 + K1\n∆T.  (6)\nFor the proposed technique, the block diagram K1 is replaced by the integrating amplifier.  \nTherefore, the signal verr of the difference and sum with integral action can be expressed as\n verr(s) = vre f(s) − vre f(s) − vf (s)\nTI s ,  (7)\nwhere TI denotes the integral time of the integrating amplifier.  Therefore, the voltage va in Eq. (6) \ncan be rewritten as\n va(s) = KmKS vre f(s) − α aTI s\n(1 + TI s) ∆T (s).  (8)\nThe circuit diagram of the proposed technique in Fig. 1(b) is shown in Fig. 2.  The operation \nSensors and Materials , Vol. 30, No. 10 (2018) 2175\nof the proposed circuit in Fig. 2 can be explained as follows.  The LVDT output signal vd and \nthe signal vS2 are summed using the summing amplifier formed by the opamp A2 and the \nresistors R3 and R 4 to provide the signal v sum.(8)  The peak-amplitude position of the signal \nvsum is detected by the peak-amplitude finder that consists of the comparators AC1 and AC2, the \ntransistor Q1, the capacitance CP, the variable resistor RV2, and the resistors RP, R5, and R6.  The \npeak-amplitude finder generates the control signal vC in the form of narrow pulse that forces the \nSHCs Ah1 and Ah2 to sample the peak amplitudes of the signals vsum and vd to the voltages va and \nvdl, respectively.  The sampled signal va is attenuated by the variable resistor RV1 and the opamp \nA3 to provide the feedback voltage vf = Kfva.  At room temperature (25 °C), the feedback signal \nvf is equal to the reference voltage vref.  The opamp A1, the capacitance C I, and the resistances \nR1 and R 2 form the difference and sum with integral action.  The resistance R2 is provided to \nprevent the unstable operation of the opamp A1 due to its parasitic capacitances.  The output \nvoltage vm of the opamp A1 can be given by\n vm(s) = (R1 + R2)\nR1\n[ R1R2\n(R1 + R2)CI s + 1\n]\n(R2CI s + 1) vre f(s) − R2\nR1 (R2CI s + 1) vf (s).  (9)\nPractically, the resistance R2 is assigned to be much greater than the resistance R1.  Thus, Eq. (9) \ncan be approximated for ω > 0 as   \n vm(s) = (R1CI s + 1)\nR1CI s vre f(s) − 1\nR1CI svf (s).  (10)\nFig. 2.

Therefore, the signal va of the proposed circuit in Fig. 2 can be stated as\n va(s) = KmKS vre f(s) − α aR1CI s\n(1 + R1CI s) ∆T (s).  (11)\n From Eqs. (8) and (11), the integral time TI is equal to R1CI.  It can be seen that the first term \non the right-hand side of Eq. (11) exhibits the sensitivity of the LVDT without interference by \nthe proposed feedback technique.  The proportional-plus-integral action occurs only in the \nsecond term on the right-hand side of Eq. (11).  It can be seen that the effect of the variation in \nambient temperature Δ T is eliminated by the integral action.  In addition, the core position l \ncan be extracted from the positive-peak amplitude of the LVDT output signal vd in the form of \nthe displacement signal v dl by using the SHC Ah2.(8)  There f ore, the temperature e ff ect in the \ndisplacement signal vdl is also avoided.  \n3. Circuit Analysis\n The ideal performance of the proposed circuit can be disturbed by the nonideal characteristic \nof devices used in the proposed scheme and the sampling rate of the SHC.  The circuit analysis \nof the proposed scheme can be explained as follows.  For the peak amplitude finder, the control \nsignal vC can be discontinued by the inappropriate value of the time constant TP = R PCP.  To \nprevent the discontinued pulse of the control signal vC, the time constant T P is assigned as \n(Tex – Tq), where Tex and Tq denote the period of the excitation frequency and the acquisition \ntime of the SHC, respectively.  From Fig. 2, the positive-peak amplitude of the voltage vsum is \nequal to KSVP.  The voltage vCP is fallen to the voltage KSVPsin[(1/2)π − (2πTq/Tex)] in the period \nof (Tex – Tq) after the peak-amplitude position of the voltage vsum.  Thus, the time constant TP \ncan be stated as\n TP = RPCP = Tex − Tq\nln 1\nsin\n( Tex − 4Tq\n2Tex\n)\nπ\n.  (12)\n To minimize the ripple voltage of the SHC output, the pulse width of the control signal vC \nis set to equal the acquisition time Tq of the SHC and provided by the time constant TW = R5CP.  \nFrom Fig. 2, the resistor R5 is used to convert the collector current i C1 of the transistor Q1 to the \nvoltage signal v ps.  The comparator AC2 and the variable resistor R V2 are provided for shaping \nthe signal vps to the control signal vC.  The collector current iC1 of the transistor Q1 is allowed to \nflow through the capacitor CP and the resistor RP, which can be expressed as\n iC1 =\nVOP\n[\n1 − sin\n( Tex − 4Tq\n2Tex\n)]\nCP\nTq\n,  (13)\nSensors and Materials , Vol. 30, No. 10 (2018) 2177\nwhere VOP denotes the peak amplitude of the voltage signal vsum.  The voltage across the resistor \nR5 is equal to iC1R5 or (VCC – VOP).  Therefore, the relationship of the time constants TW and Tq \ncan be given by\n TW = R5CP = (VCC − VOP) Tq\nVOP\n[\n1 − sin\n( Tex − 4Tq\n2Tex\n)\nπ\n] .  (14)\nIf Tq = 6.5 µs, f ex = 5 kHz, V OP = 2.92 V, V CC = 12 V, and C P = 0.1 µF, then the resistances \nRP and R 5 can be calculated as 92.16 and 9.7 kΩ, respectively.  For stability consideration, \nthe transfer function FSH(s) of the SHC can be approximated using the first-order Padé \napproximation for the sampling time Tex as(17)\n FSH (s) = e−Tex s\n(1 + TSH s) =\n(\n−Tex\n2 s + 1\n)\n( Tex\n2 s + 1\n)\n(TSH s + 1)\n,  (15)\nwhere TSH and Tex denote the response time of the SHC and the period of excitation frequency, \nrespectively.  Figure 3 shows a block diagram of Fig. 2 including the nonideal characteristics \nof active devices used in the proposed scheme.  From Fig. 3, Tsu and T m are time constants \nof the opamp A2 with unity gain and the response time of voltage-controlled amplifier Amul, \nrespectively.  The time constant Tsu of the opamp A2 is equal to 1/ GBP, where GBP is the gain \nbandwidth product of the opamp A2.  Note that the time constants T su, Tm, and T SH are much \nless than the period of the excitation frequency.  Therefore, the transfer function of the proposed \nscheme in Fig. 3 can be approximated as\nFig. 3.

Also, the degree of change in \nambient temperature is much lower than the excitation frequency.  Then, the zeros of the second \nterm on the right-hand side of Eq. (16) satisfy the condition of |(Tm + Tsu – Tex/2)ω| << 1 and Eq. (16) \ncan be approximately given by \n va(s) =\n[(\nTI − Tex\n2\n)\ns + 1\n]\nKmKS\n(\nTI − Tex\n2\n)\ns + 1\nvre f(s) − α aTI s(\nTI − Tex\n2\n)\ns + 1\n∆T(s).   (17)\nFrom Eq. (17), the condition of TI > T ex/2 is assigned for stability consideration.  The steady- \nstate behavior against the signal vref for Km = 1 can be given by\n va = KS vre f = 2KLlCvre f.  (18)\nIt can be seen that the amplitude of the signal va is only dependent on the sensitivity of the \nLVDT.  If the change in ambient temperature, ΔT, is considered, then the derivation of the signal \nva against the temperature Δ T can be written as\n va(s) = α aTI s(\nTI − Tex\n2\n)\ns + 1\n∆T(s).  (19)\nPractically, the change in ambient temperature, Δ T, is slow against the excitation frequency, \nand the time constant T I is much larger than the period T ex of the excitation frequency fex to \nprevent the phase shift caused by the sampling signal of the SHC.  Therefore, Eq. (19) can be \napproximated as\n va(s) = α aTI s\nTI s + 1 ∆T(s).  (20)\n The integral time TI can be determined as T I ≥ 10Tex.  From the circuit in Fig. 2, the settling \ntime TS for the sudden change in ambient temperature, Δ T, can be measured from the interval \ntime of the maximum change in the signal va to decrease to 0.1% and can be given by\n TS = 6.908TI.  (21)\nSensors and Materials , Vol. 30, No. 10 (2018) 2179\n Practically, the integral time TI is assigned as 10 Tex for the fast response time.  Then, the \nsettling time TS is about 13.816 ms.  \n4. Experimental Results\n The proposed circuit in Fig. 2 was implemented to confirm the circuit performance.  The \nactive devices used in the circuit were commercially available devices such as the opamp LF351 \nfor A1 and A2, the voltage-controlled amplifier Amul formed by the analog multiplier AD633, \nthe SHC LF398 for Ah1 and A h2, and the comparator LM339 for AC2.  The comparator AC1 and \nthe transistor Q 1 were provided in the same integrated circuit package as LM311.  The GBPs \nof the opamps A1 and A 2 are about 3 MHz and the time constant Tsu can be approximated as \n53 ns.  The LVDT of ±12.5 mm stroke range and the sensitivity of 69 mV/mm/V at 5 kHz were \nused in this study. (8)  The voltage gain Km of the voltage-controlled amplifier Amul was set to \n1.  The resistors R3 = R4 = 30 kΩ and RV1 = RV2 = 10 kΩ were assigned.  The supply voltages \nwere set to ±12 V.  The excitation signal vsin was assigned as a 5 kHz sinusoidal wave of 2 V \npeak-to-peak voltage, where the period T ex of the excitation frequency was calculated as 0.2 \nms.  The reference voltage vref was set to 1 V.  The capacitances Ch1 = Ch2 = 0.01 µF were used \nfor the SHCs Ah1 and Ah2, which caused the acquisition time of about Tq = 6.5 µs.  For the peak \namplitude finder, the capacitance CP was chosen as 0.1 µF.  Therefore, the resistances RP and R5 \nwere determined from Eqs. (12) and (14) as 92.16 and 9.73 kΩ, respectively.  From Eq. (21), the \nintegral time T I was assigned to equal 10 Tex or 2 ms for the fast response time and the resistor \nR1 = 20 kΩ was calculated for the capacitance CI set to 0.1 µF.  The resistance R2 = 300 kΩ was \nassigned for the condition of R2 >> R 1 to avoid the unstable operation of the opamp A1.  The \nvariable resistor RV1 was adjusted for scaling the voltage vf equal to the reference voltage vref at \nroom temperature.  Figure 4 shows the signal waveforms vex and vsum of the proposed scheme \nin Fig. 2.  It also shows the phase shift between the signals vex and vsum of about 18°.  The output \nθL = 18°\nvex\nvsum\nFig. 4. Measured waveforms of vex and vsum.\n2180 Sensors and Materials , Vol. 30, No. 10 (2018)\nvoltage va of the SHC Ah1 is equal to the peak amplitude of the signal vsum because the sampling \nsignal vC occurred at the peak-amplitude position of the signal vsum.  To verify the temperature \nperformance, the LVDT was operated under the varying ambient temperature from 20 to 70 \n°C and the varying core position of the LVDT from −10 to 10 mm.  The relative error of the \nmeasured results in percentage can be expressed as\n relative error(%) = |∆l|\nl × 100%, (22) \nwhere Δl denotes the error between the measured and actual values.  The temperature effect \nin the core displacement signal v d without temperature compensation is shown in Fig. 5(a).  \nFigure 5(b) shows the measured results of the core displacement signal with the temperature \ncompensation.  It can be seen that the proposed technique can reduce the maximum relative \nerror from 6.52 to 0.098%.  Figure 6 shows the drift of the offset voltage of the output signal vdl \nFig. 5.

Conclusions\n A technique to reduce the error of the LVDT signal caused by the variation in ambient \ntemperature has been proposed.  The effect of the change in ambient temperature was discussed \nin detail.  The proposed technique required the integral action to reduce the error caused by the \nchange in ambient temperature.  The proposed circuit was implemented using commercially \navailable devices.  The performance characteristics of the proposed circuit were discussed and \nconfirmed by experimental implementation.  It is evident that the proposed scheme provides \nadequate performance for the applications of the LVDT in an environment with a highly \nfluctuating temperature such as a steam control valve, a power turbine, a nuclear reactor, a \nflight control actuation system, a variable area nozzle for aircraft, and an automotive active \nsuspension system.\nAcknowledgments\n This work was supported by the King Mongkut’s Institute of Technology Ladkrabang (KMITL), \nThailand, under Grant No. KREF115701.\nReferences\n 1 R.
