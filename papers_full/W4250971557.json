  "abstract": "CAAD toolsUntil recently, building information modeling (BIM) software such as Autodesk Revit, Bentley Architecture, Graphisoft ArchiCAD, and Vectorworks Architect focused primarily on modeling and refining building geometry.Users relied on third-party software such as Green Building Studio, Ecotect, Hevacomp and IES VE to analyze the energy consumption of a building.A series of developments in the past few years (since 2008) changed that: there are many CAAD software today which include some form of connection to an energy simulation program thereby allowing passive solar gains preduction.Amongst the CAAD tools reviewed, the following BIM applications offer the most interesting possibilities for energy simulations including passive solar gains predictions: Allplan, ArchiCAD, DDS-CAD PV, MicroStation, Revit and Vectorworks.Google SketchUp, which is not a BIM application, also integrates many plugins: IES VE-Ware, OpenStudio, and Google SketchUp Demeter, which allow performing thermal simulations based on IES VE, EnergyPlus and Green Building Studio.Google SketchUp is widely recognized for being used at EDP and is often used in the architect's workflow as a predecessor software to another more complex BIM or non-BIM applications (e.g.AutoCAD).None of the other CAAD software examined in this review allow passive solar gains prediction, either at EDP or at detailed design phase.Note that AutoCAD models (.dwg) can be exported to Ecotect or to other simulation software since the .dwgformat is a widely accepted file format.A plugin called EnergyPlugged plugin is also available in beta version for running EnergyPlus from AutoCAD.Note however that AutoCAD is more suited for the detailed design phase.Apart from perhaps ArchiCAD and Google SketchUp, which are convivial for EDP work, all the programs reviewed are more suited for detailed design than EDP.For EDP work, it is crucial for the architect to feel s/he has a \"free\" hand, i.e. having the capacity to easily modify a building's overall volume, geometry and orientation.The changes made on these parameters (volume, geometry, orientation) should be connected to a direct, explicit feedback about passive solar gains.This review outlines the fact that this type of direct explicit feedback is still lacking in many CAAD-BIM programs but that the recent advances in this field are promising.",
