INTRODUCTION \nThe bandpass filtering impedance transformer (IT) is rapidly \ndeveloping in modern communication systems. This IT is in-\ncreasingly becoming necessary in many applications, such as \npower dividers [1], antenna feeding lines [2], and amplifier de-\nsign [3]. Indeed, a conventional quarter-wavelength transformer \nis a well-known IT [4], but this network has some limitations, \nsuch as difficulty in the realization of a high impedance trans-\nforming ratio and poor out-of-band suppression. In recent years, \nvarious structures of filtering IT have been proposed [5–11]. A \nmixed lumped and distributed IT  with low-pass filtering re-\nsponse is designed in [5]. However, the shunt capacitors can pro-\nduce a self-resonance frequency, which introduces additional par-\nasitic effects at high frequency. Wideband ITs are proposed using \nan open-circuit parallel-coupled line with an interconnecting \ntransmission line (TL) [6] and a multiple-section stepped-im-\npedance TL with input/output couplings [7]. However, their im-\npedance transforming ratio is low. In [8], an open-circuit stub \ncoupled-line IT with a bandpass filtering response is designed to \ntransform 20 Ω to 50 Ω. In [9], a bandpass response coupled-line \nIT with an ultra-high impedance transforming ratio is presented \nby using two-section open-ended coupled lines. This IT is appli-\ncable to low termination impedance. Therefore, a short-ended \ncoupled-line IT with an ultra-high impedance transforming ratio \nis proposed [10] for high load termination impedance. High se-\nlectivity is obtained by increasing the number of stages, but the \ninsertion loss is degraded. Moreover, the stopband characteristic \nis limited. In [11], a bandpass filtering IT is designed with a sec-\ntion of open-ended coupled lines and an open-circuit stub TL. \n \nA Coupled Line Impedance Transformer for High  \nTermination Impedance with a Bandpass  \nFiltering Response \nPhirun Kim ∙ Yongchae Jeong*  \n \n \n   \nAbstract \n \nIn this study, a short-ended coupled line with a short-circuit stub transmission line bandpass filtering impedance transformer is presented. \nThe general designed equations are derived on the basis of circuit theory. The design curves are provided to examine the charac teristic of \nthe proposed impedance transformer. The prop osed circuit is suitable for high termination impedance. To validate the design for mulas, a \n400–50 Ω impedance transformer is designed and fabricated at the operating center frequency (f0) of 2.6 GHz. The measured results show \na good agreement with the simulation. The measured insertion and return losses are 0.6 dB and 22.5 dB at f0, respectively.

The \nproposed network can be applied to high load termination im-\npedance. A short-circuit stub TL can produce several transmis-\nsion zeros in the stopband. Moreover, a bandpass filtering re-\nsponse with high selectivity can be obtained. \nII.\n DESIGN EQUATION \nFig. 1(a) shows the schematic of the proposed IT, which is \ncomposed of a short-end parallel-coupled line and a short-circuit \nstub TL with a characteristic admittance of Y1 connected at cou-\npling port 2 of the coupled line. The electrical lengths of the par-\nallel-coupled line (θ) and the short-circuit stub TL (2θ) are given \nas a quarter-wavelength (λ/4) and a half-wavelength (λ/2) at f0, \nrespectively. A short-circuit stub TL is used to create two trans-\nmission poles in the passband and three transmission zeros in the \nstopband [11], where the transmission zeros are located on the \nlower and upper sides of the passband, respectively. The proposed \ncircuit is efficient at high termination impedance. Fig. 1(b) shows \nthe schematic of the impedance transformer in [11] with an \nopen-end parallel-coupled line and an open-circuit stub TL. The \nnetwork is used only for low termination impedance. \nThe reflection and transmission coefficients of the proposed \nIT network, where input port 1 and output port 3 are terminated \nwith the admittances Y\nS and YL, respectively, can be derived as \n(1).   \n   \n  \n  \n11 22 12 21\n11\n11 22 12 21\nSS\nSS\nYYY r Y Y YS YY Y r Y Y Y\n          ( 1 a )  \n  \n21\n21\n11 22 12 21\n2 SL\nSS\nYY YS YYY r Y Y Y   ,         ( 1 b )  \n \nwhere \n \n\n \n2\n00\n11 0 0\n10 0\ncotcot\n22 c o t 2 c o t\noe\neo\neo\nYYYj Y Y YY Y\n\n\n        ( 2 a )  \n \n\n0000\n12 21\n10 0\ncotcsc 122 c o t 2 c o t\neooe\neo\nYYYYYY j YY Y\n \n    \n   ( 2 b )  \n\n\n2\n0000\n22\n10 0\ncsc cot2 2 cot 2 cot\neoeo\neo\nYYYYYj YY Y\n \n   \n   ( 2 c )  \n02\nf\nf\n  .

Z0e dramatically decreases as r in-\ncreases. With the same r, Z0e increases as Z0o increases. Therefore, \na higher r requires a relatively looser coupling than a lower r, \nwhere the coupling coefficient is given by C = 20 log[(Z0e – Z0o) \n/ (Z0e + Z0o)] [dB]. The calculation is conducted by choosing ZL \n= 50 Ω, S11 = –20 dB at f0, Z0o = 27 Ω, 30 Ω, 35 Ω, and r varies \nfrom 2 to 12.  \nSimilarly, Fig. 3 shows the variations of Z1 according to r and \nZ0o. Z1 increases as r increases. Moreover, Z1 increases more with \na higher Z0o.
