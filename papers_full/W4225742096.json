I NTRODUCTION\nI\nN recent years, road networks have attracted considerable at-\ntention in the ﬁeld of autonomous driving. The graph of road\nnetworks can provide fundamental information for autonomous-\nvehicle applications. The graph of road networks is a kind of\nvectorized data representation, which consists of vertices and\nedges [1]. Each road segment could be seen as a graph edge, and\nthe intersection points of road segments are vertices. Manually\nannotating the road network graph is time-consuming and labor-\nintensive, especially when road networks cover a large area\nThis work was supported by Zhongshan Science and Technology Bu-\nreau Fund, under project 2020AG002, Foshan-HKUST Project no.

The ﬁgure\nis best viewed in color. Please zoom in for details.\n(e.g., a whole city). Therefore, how to automatically detect road\nnetwork graphs using automatic algorithms in large areas is of\ngreat interest to the research community.\nTo address this issue, past approaches on road network graph\ndetection usually use aerial images obtained from unmanned\naerial vehicles (UA Vs) or satellites [2]. As aerial imaging tech-\nnology evolves, high-resolution and high-quality aerial images\ncan be easily accessed world-widely nowadays. Moreover, some\naerial imaging datasets also provide extra channels besides Red-\nGreen-Blue (RGB), such as the infrared channel [3], making\nthem more informative for detection purpose. So, this work also\nuses aerial images for road network graph detection.\nExisting works on road network graph detection can be\ngenerally classiﬁed into two categories: segmentation-based\napproaches [2], [4]–[13] and graph-based approaches [14]–[18].\nThe segmentation-based approaches ﬁrst predict the probabilis-\ntic segmentation map of the road network graph, and then\nconduct a series of processing to obtain the graph structure\nof the road network, such as skeletonization and ﬁltering.\nMost of the early works on road network graph detection\nin this ﬁeld fall into this category. The segmentation-based\napproaches could present good results in the pixel-level eval-\nuation (e.g., by F1 score) due to the use of existing powerful\nsemantic segmentation networks, but they usually suffer from\nunsatisfactory topology correctness such as incorrect crossroad\nconnectivity and false disconnection on the road. To address\narXiv:2202.07824v2  [cs.CV]  26 Jun 2022\n2\nthis issue, recent graph-based approaches resort to detecting\nthe graph of road networks directly [14], [15], [17], [18]. They\nusually ﬁrst predict candidate initial vertices, then, starting from\neach candidate initial vertex, train a decision-making agent to\npredict adjacent vertices of the current vertex. In this way, road\nnetwork graphs can be generated vertex-by-vertex in an iterative\nmanner. Although these graph-based approaches could enhance\nthe topology correctness, they are usually composed of two\nseparate stages, making them hard to be optimized in an end-\nto-end way. The separate stages might accumulate errors and\nhence degrade their effectiveness and efﬁciency.\nTo provide a solution to these issues, in this paper, we propose\na graph-based end-to-end approach named Road Network Graph\nDetection by Transformer (RNGDet). Similar to previous graph-\nbased approaches, RNGDet starts from predicted candidate ini-\ntial vertices to extract local visual features using a convolutional\nneural network (CNN) backbone, and then sends the features\nto a transformer network inspired by the DETR structure [19].\nDue to the use of deep vertex queries, RNGDet can directly\npredict any number of adjacent vertices of the current vertex\nat one time, so that it can handle any road networks, even\nthose with complicated topology (e.g., road intersections of\narbitrary numbers of road segments). Different from previous\ngraph-based approaches, RNGDet can be optimized as a whole\nand trained end-to-end. We train RNGDet through imitation\nlearning to enable it to take the most appropriate action under\ndifferent circumstances. To generate the training data (i.e.,\nexpert demonstration from the imitation learning perspective),\nwe propose a sampling algorithm to supervise the agent to\nexplore the whole road network. The proposed RNGDet is\ntrained and evaluated on a publicly available dataset released\nby RoadTracer [14]. With this dataset, we compare RNGDet\nwith state-of-the-art works based on multiple evaluation metric\nscores. An example of RNGDet is visualized in Fig. 1. The\ncontributions of our work are summarized below:\n• We propose an end-to-end trainable approach named\nRNGDet based on transformer and imitation learning to\nautomatically detect the road network graph.\n• We propose an algorithm to automatically generate training\nsamples for RNGDet.\n• We evaluate RNGDet and compare it with state-of-the-art\nworks on a publicly available dataset to demonstrate the\nsuperiority of RNGDet.\nThe remainder of this article is organized as follows. Section\nII introduces related works. Section III describes the structure\nand working pipeline of RNGDet. Section IV presents exper-\nimental results, discussions, and limitations. Conclusions and\nfuture work are drawn in the last section.\nII. R ELATED WORKS\nA. Segmentation-based approaches\nSegmentation-based road network graph detection approaches\n[2], [4]–[13], [20]–[22] mainly have two stages: (1) predict\nthe segmentation map (i.e., probabilistic map of the road\nnetwork) and (2) process the segmentation map and obtain\ngraph structures by post-processing, such as skeletonization and\nheuristic-based algorithms [23], [24]. It is believed that [2]\nproposed by Mnih et al. is the ﬁrst work that implemented\nneural networks to detect the road network in aerial images.\nThey ﬁrst split the large aerial image into small patches, then\npredicted the road network within each patch and ﬁnally merged\npatches into the ﬁnal predicted road network segmentation\nmap. Most later segmentation-based works followed a similar\npipeline, but with more powerful segmentation networks, such\nas U-Net [25], DeepLab V3+ [26], FPN [27] and HRNet\n[28]. Batra et al. [8] extended the aforementioned works by\nadding another reﬁnement network to ﬁx incorrect pixels in\nthe predicted segmentation map, which effectively improved the\nﬁnal performance. In [11], Gedara et al. proposed a Spatial\nand Interaction Space Graph Reasoning (SPIN) module, which\nperformed reasoning over graphs constructed on spatial and\ninteraction spaces projected from the feature maps. In this way,\nspatial and topology information are better utilized to improve\nroad detection performance. Generative adversarial network\n(GAN) is also a popular tool for map generation tasks [20]–\n[22], but usually, these works output maps in raster format,\nsuch as styled map tiles. Thus, post-processing is still needed\nto vectorize maps.\nAfter obtaining the probabilistic map of a road network, post-\nprocessing should be conducted to extract the road centerline,\nﬁlter out outlier road segments and ﬁx incorrect disconnections\nof the road network. To better extract the road-network graph,\nin [24], Bulatov et al. proposed a similarity criteria to fuse raw\nroad segments into chains and designed a two-stage algorithm\nto optimize the obtained road chains. This work can handle\ncurve roads and sharp circle arcs well. Wenzel et al. [23]\nfurther enhanced [24] to generate longer and more accurate road\nnetwork chains by proposing an iterative greedy optimization\nprocedure.\nSince semantic segmentation only works on pixel-level pre-\ndictions, the topology information is not effectively considered.\nThus, the road network graph obtained by segmentation-based\napproaches tends to have poor topology correctness. Moreover,\nhandcrafted or heuristic post-processing algorithms cannot ef-\nfectively correct errors in the obtained road network graph.\nB. Graph-based approaches\nDifferent from segmentation-based approaches, graph-based\napproaches for road network graph detection can directly output\nthe graph structure. Most of the graph-based works detect the\nroad network graph by iterative graph generation [14]–[18].\nRoadTracer [14] is believed to be the ﬁrst work that iteratively\ngenerates the road network graph. In this work, ground-truth\ninitial vertices were used to initialize the iteration. From each\ninitial vertex, RoadTracer predicted the direction of the adjacent\nvertices of the current vertex as a multi-class classiﬁcation\nproblem, then moved the agent in the predicted direction by\na ﬁxed length. RoadTracer presented much better topology\nperformance than past segmentation-based approaches, but it\nfailed to detect road intersections with high quality due to the\nﬁxed step length. Tan et al. [17] solved this problem by re-\nplacing the direction prediction with heatmap prediction, where\nheatmap demonstrated the probabilistic distribution of adjacent\nvertices of the current vertex. After obtaining the heatmap, the\nauthors extracted local peaks as the predicted adjacent vertices.\nAlthough this approach had dynamic step length and presented\n3\nsuperior performance to past works, it can not be optimized in\nan end-to-end way due to the post-processing of the heatmap,\nwhich degrades the ﬁnal performance. In addition, this work\ncannot distinguish vertices that are close to each other.\nDifferent from aforementioned iterative graph-based ap-\nproaches, Song et al. [16] proposed Sat2Graph to directly\npredict the road network graph. Taken as input an aerial image,\nSat2Graph predicted a 19 dimension tensor. This high dimension\ntensor contained all the information of the road network graph\nso that the graph could be decoded from the feature tensor by\nalgorithms proposed in Sat2Graph [16]. However, Sat2Graph\nhad the isomorphic encoding issue analyzed in [16], which\nmade it difﬁcult to supervise during training. Moreover, it cannot\ndistinguish road segments whose intersection angle is small.\nC. Graph detection of objects similar to road networks\nThere are some tasks that are similar to road network de-\ntection, such as the detection of road boundaries [29]–[31],\nroad lane lines [32]–[35], road lane [36], [37] and road curbs\n[38], [39]. Even though these works do not work on road\nnetwork detection, their tasks are similar to ours and some\nideas or techniques are also inspiring to us. Xu et al. [38] ﬁrst\nproposed to analyze the graph detection problem using imitation\nlearning, and designed a DAgger-based system for road curb\ndetection following the DAgger algorithm [40]. Homayounfar et\nal. proposed DagMapper [33] to detect road lane line graph in\nthe point cloud map on the highway. DagMapper can predict the\ndirection of adjacent vertices of the current vertex, and whether\nthe agent should create a new lane line branch when lane line\nintersections were encountered. Although these works could be\ninspiring for our task, they cannot handle the road network graph\ndetection task since road networks have much more complicated\ntopology (e.g., road split, road merge and crossroads).\nD. Transformer-based detection\nIn recent years, transformer [41] has been receiving more\nand more attention since its powerful parallelization capacity\nand great ability to handle sequential tasks. Considering these\nproperties, Carion et al. [19] proposed Detection by Transformer\n(DETR) for one-shot 2D object detection, which is anchor free\nand can be trained in an end-to-end way. After extracting image\nfeatures by a CNN backbone, DETR sent the obtained features\nas well as multiple object queries to a transformer, and then ob-\ntained the bounding box coordinates of objects. Each bounding\nbox was encoded by a 4D embedding. Therefore, taken as input\nan image, DETR can directly output the coordinates of object\nbounding boxes. Xu et al. [42] adapted DETR to line segment\ndetection task and named the new model as Line Segment\nDetection by Transformer (LETR). In this paper, the authors\nencoded each line segment as an embedding and predicted the\nencoding embedding by a DETR-based network. Similarly, Can\net al. [43] modiﬁed the DETR network and pursued to detect\nlane centerlines. Each lane centerline was ﬁtted by a B-spline\nand each B-spline was encoded by an embedding. In this way,\nthe authors could directly detect all lane centerlines at one time\nby predicting the embedding that encoded B-spline information.\nOur work RNGDet is also inspired by DETR, while the output\nembedding encodes the information of adjacent vertices of the\ncurrent vertex.\nE. Imitation learning\nImitation learning aims to train a decision-making agent\nnetwork to mimic an expert. The most commonly used imitation\nlearning algorithm is behavior cloning [44]. In behavior cloning,\nan expert generates a set of demonstrations and the agent tries\nto learn the policy of the expert. This algorithm is efﬁcient but\nit suffers from the drifting problem of imitation learning [45].\nRoss et al. proposed a meta-algorithm called Dataset Aggrega-\ntion (DAgger) [40] which could cover a much larger state space\nto relieve the drifting problem. However, the DAgger algorithm\npresents quite a low sampling efﬁciency. Based on DAgger, Xu\net al. designed approaches to detect road elements by imitation\nlearning in [30], [38]. In this paper, since behavior cloning can\nalready achieve satisfactory performance, considering the low-\nefﬁciency performance of DAgger, we adopt behavior cloning\nin our experiments.\nIII. T HE PROPOSED APPROACH\nA. Approach overview\nThis work aims to detect the road network graph from aerial\nimages, and the road network graph can be used for real-world\napplications (e.g., autonomous vehicle navigation). Suppose the\ninput is a large aerial image IA, then the ﬁnal output should be\na graph G= (V,E). E = {ei}is a set of graph edges and each\nedge ei represents a road segment. V = {vj}is a set of graph\nvertices, and each vertex vj is either one intersection point of\nsome road segments or the endpoint of a broken road.\nBased on the DETR structure, our proposed RNGDet detects\nthe road network graph by iterations. Starting from a pre-\npredicted candidate initial vertex in C = {ck}K\nk=1, RNGDet\niteratively generates the road network graph by controlling an\nagent exploring the road network. During iterations, the history\ntrajectory of the agent is recorded by the graph G. At each\nstep, centering at the current position of the agent vt, RNGDet\ncrops an ROI ∈R3×L×L on IA and rasterizes G within the\nROI as H∈ R1×L×L. A CNN backbone network is utilized\nto extract the deep visual feature of the ROI as FI which is\nsent to the segmentation heads to predict the road segment\nsegmentation map Sand the road intersection segmentation map\nI. The candidate initial vertices in C can be obtained by ﬁnding\nlocal peaks of I. After concatenating Hwith Sand I, another\nCNN backbone network is used to extract the deep feature FH.\nThen, FH and FI are fused as the input feature tensor of the\ntransformer.\nTaking N vertex queries Q = {qi}N\ni=1 as input, the trans-\nformer decoder directly predicts N vertex embeddings encoding\nthe valid probability and coordinates of vertices. Each vertex\nquery is a learned embedding, which could be treated as a slot\nused by RNGDet to make the prediction of one vertex. Thus\nthe number of vertex queries N must be larger than the largest\nnumber of vertices needed to be predicted. After ﬁltering out\nvertices with low probability, we obtain M(M ≤ N) valid\nvertices that are adjacent to vt as a set V = {vi\nt+1}M\ni=1. If\nM = 0, RNGDet pops a new candidate initial vertex from C\nand repeats the above process; if M = 1, the agent moves to the\npredicted coordinate and repeats the above process; if M >1,\nthe agent pushes all the predicted vertices into set C, pops one\nvertex from set C and then repeats the above process.

The ﬁgure shows a single step in the graph detection process of RNGDet. In this\nexample, RNGDet processes a road intersection. Suppose the agent is at vt at the current time step (denoted by a yellow node\nin H), we crop an ROI on the input aerial image IA and rasterize the graph generated so far G within the ROI as H. A CNN\nbackbone network predicts the feature FI of the ROI. Then, FI is sent to the segmentation heads to predict Sand I. Taken as\ninput S, Iand H, another CNN network predicts the deep feature tensor FH and concatenates it with FI as the ﬁnal feature\ntensor F. The transformer predicts the adjacent vertices V= {vi\nt+1}M\ni=1 of vt. In the updated graph of this example, there are\nthree predicted adjacent vertices {vi\nt+1}3\ni=1 (yellow nodes), and they are connected with the current vertex vt (blue node) by three\nnew edges (orange lines). The graph G is generated in this way iteratively. This ﬁgure is best viewed in color. Please zoom in\nfor details.\nC is empty, RNGDet stops and outputs the ﬁnal road network\ngraph.

Due to the size of input\nimages, RNGDet crops a ROI ∈ R3×L×L (L is 256 in our\nexperiment) on IA. A multi-layer convolutional neural network\n(CNN) is utilized to extract the deep feature of the ROI as FI,\nand the CNN backbone in this paper is ResNet [46]. Based on\nthe extracted deep feature FI, two feature paradigm network\n(FPN) [27] segmentation heads predict the segmentation map S\nand I, where Sdemonstrates the distribution of road segments\nand Ishows the distribution of road intersection points as well\nas endpoints of broken roads. Both segmentation tasks are binary\nsegmentation.\nTo obtain the information of past trajectories, we crop G in\nthe same way as cropping the ROI and rasterize the cropped G\nas H∈ R1×L×L for afterward concatenation. With S, Iand\nHas input, another CNN network outputs the feature tensor\nFH. Two feature tensors are concatenated together as the ﬁnal\nfeature tensor F, containing all the information required by the\ntransformer.\nC. Transformer architecture\nAfter obtaining the deep feature tensor F, the transformer\npredicts the adjacent vertices {vi\nt+1}M\ni=1 of the current vertex vt.\nAlgorithm 1: RNGDet\nInput: An aerial image IA\nOutput: The road network graph G= (V,E)\n1 begin\n2 C ←find initial vertex(IA)\n3 Initialize G as an empty graph\n4 while C not empty do\n5 t←0\n6 vt ←C.pop()\n7 while true do\n8 F← CNN(IA,G,v t)\n9 {ˆvi\nt+1}N\ni=1 ←Transformer (F|Q)\n10 V← filter({ˆvi\nt+1}N\ni=1)\n11 if |V|= 0 then\n12 break\n13 else if |V|= 1 then\n14 vt ←ˆv1\nt+1\n15 t←t+ 1\n16 update G\n17 else if |V|>1 then\n18 C ←C∪V\n19 update G\n20 break\n21 end\n22 end\n23 return G\n24 end\n5\nThe feature tensor Fis reduced to a sequence of smaller tensors,\nand then ﬁxed positional encoding [47], [48] is fused due\nto the permutation-invariant characteristics of the transformer\narchitecture [19]. The input and output of the transformer\nencoder have the same length.\nThe decoder of the transformer takes in the output sequence\nof the encoder as well as a set of vertex queries Q= {qi}N\ni=1,\nand predicts N embeddings of the adjacent vertices. Each vertex\nquery qi is a learned embedding and produces one predicted\nadjacent vertex. In fact, the transformer outputs the Maximum-\na-Posterior (MAP) estimation of vertices at the next time step\n{argmax\nvi\nt+1\np[vi\nt+1|F,vt,qi]}N\ni=1, (1)\nEach output embedding can be decoded into a valid proba-\nbility pi\nt+1 and a 2D vertex coordinate vi\nt+1 by feed-forward\nnetworks (FFN). pi\nt+1 demonstrates the probability that vi\nt+1\nis valid and should be added into the road network graph G.\nSuppose we have M(M ≤N) valid predicted vertices as a set\nV= {vi\nt+1}M\ni=1, then for each valid predicted vertex vi\nt+1, we\nupdate the road network graph G by adding vi\nt+1 into V and\na new edge connecting vi\nt+1 with vt into E.

In our experiment, the B×256 ×8 ×8-sized\nfeature tensor is split into a 64-length sequence, which contains\nB×256-sized tensors. Then, the transformer encoder processes\nthe input tensors and outputs a sequence of feature tensors\nwhose shape is the same as that of the input. Finally, based on\nthe encoder output and vertex queries, the transformer decoder\npredicts N vertices {vi\nt+1}N\ni=1, and the valid probability pi\nt+1 of\neach vertex vi\nt+1. Vertices with high enough pi\nt+1 are regarded\nas valid vertices and used for graph updates.\nRNGDet\n𝑣𝑡+1\n1\n𝑣𝑡+1\n2\n𝑣𝑡+1\n𝑀\n…\nValid vertices\n𝒗𝒕\nM?\nM=0\nM=1\nM>1\nUpdate 𝑣𝑡\nby 𝑣𝑡+1\n1\nPush all \n𝑣𝑡+1\n𝑖 into C\nOutput road \nnetwork graph\nCandidate initial \nvertex set C|C|=0?

Please zoom in for details.\nD. Policy for graph generation during inference period\nDuring the inference period, RNGDet generates the road\nnetwork graph by iterations. First, we initialize the candidate\ninitial vertex set Cby ﬁnding local peaks of the road intersection\nsegmentation map I. Then, RNGDet pops one vertex vt from\nthe set C. Centering at vt, RNGDet crops input images and\npredicts valid vertices at the next time step as V. Based on\nthe number of valid vertices |V|= M, RNGDet takes different\nactions to update the road network graph: (1) M = 0. It means\n6\nGraph\nsimplification\nFig. 6: Visualization of the simpliﬁcation of the ground-truth\nroad network graph. In the raw ground-truth graph, there are\nvarious kinds of vertices with different degrees (yellow nodes\nin the left subﬁgure). For training label calculation, we remove\nvertices whose degrees are two. After ﬁltering, only intersection\nvertices (degrees larger than 2) and endpoint vertices (degrees\nare 1) remain (pink nodes in the right subﬁgure). The road\nconnecting two adjacent vertices is deﬁned as a road segment.\nThe agent must ﬁnish exploring a road segment before switching\nto other road segments. In this way, we can guarantee the\ncorrectness of automatically generated labels. This ﬁgure is best\nviewed in color.\nthere is no road ahead, thus RNGDet should stop processing the\ncurrent road and turns to work on other roads if C is not empty.\n(2) M = 1. This happens when RNGDet travels along a single\nroad. RNGDet adds v1\nt+1 into V and edge (vt,v1\nt+1) into E,\nand then moves to v1\nt+1. RNGDet keeps updating the graph in\nthis way until intersections or broken roads are met. (3) M >1.\nThis indicates that RNGDet encounters road intersections and\nneeds to generate new vertices in multiple directions. RNGDet\nwill update the graph, push all vertices in Vto C, and pop one\ncandidate initial vertex from C.\nRNGDet keeps running the above iterations to generate the\nroad network graph vertex-by-vertex. If and only if the candidate\ninitial vertex set C is empty, RNGDet stops and outputs the\ngenerated road network graph G= (V,E). The pipeline of the\nroad network graph generation process of RNGDet is visualized\nin Fig. 4. Some example visualizations are shown in Fig. 5.\nE. Training label calculation\nBased on the ground-truth road network graph and the current\nlocation of the agent vt, we can automatically generate the\ntraining label for RNGDet (i.e., S∗,I∗,V∗= {(vi\nt+1)∗}M\ni=1). The\nsegmentation labels can be simply cropped from the ground-\ntruth segmentation masks centering at vt. For V∗, we need to\nobtain coordinates of the ground-truth vertices at the next time\nstep. To achieve that, we (1) simplify the ground-truth road\nnetwork graph by removing vertices whose degree is 2 and (2)\ngenerate the label vertices at the next time step based on the\nground-truth road network graph.\nThe raw ground-truth graph consists of various kinds of\nvertices, such as endpoint vertices (degrees are 1), vertices in\nthe middle of roads (degrees are 2) and intersection vertices\n(degrees are larger than 2). Among them, vertices whose degrees\nare 2 are not uniquely deﬁned and could be removed without\nharming the road network topology. Therefore, for simplicity,\n(a)\n (b)\n (c)\n (d)\nFig. 7: Examples of training label generation. Cyan lines are\nground-truth road network, pink lines are history road network,\nblue nodes represents vt and (vi\nt+1)∗ is denoted by yellow\nnodes. The radiant of the orange circle in (a)-(c) is τ while\nthe radiant of the orange circle in (d) is τ′. τ′ is smaller\nthan τ in our experiment. (a) Road-segment-mode. The road\nahead is straight. (b) Road-segment-mode. The road ahead has\nturning points with large enough curvature. (c) Road-segment-\nmode. The agent should connect vt with a previously generated\ncandidate initial vertex. (d) Intersection-mode. There are three\nnew road segments that are incident to the current intersection\npoint. This ﬁgure is best viewed in color.\nwe remove these vertices from the ground-truth graph. This pro-\ncess is visualized in Fig. 6. After the graph simpliﬁcation, there\nare only endpoint vertices and intersection vertices remaining.\nTo facilitate the calculation of labels, we deﬁne every road\nconnecting adjacent vertices as a road segment. The agent will\nbe either in road-segment-mode or intersection-mode. The road-\nsegment-mode indicates that the agent is currently traveling\nalong a road segment, and there will be only one ground-truth\nvalid vertex at each step (i.e., V∗= {(v1\nt+1)∗}). Three examples\nare visualized in subﬁgure (a), (b) and (c) of Fig. 7. To prevent\nthe agent from being trapped in an inﬁnite loop, the training\nlabel should encourage the agent to move forward (i.e., (v1\nt+1)∗\nshould be far enough from vt and move to the unexplored\npart of the current road segment). If the road ahead is straight\n(i.e., no turning points with large curvature within τ distance\nto vt), we select the point whose distance is τ away from vt\nas (v1\nt+1)∗ (subﬁgure (a) of Fig. 7). If there are some turning\npoints ahead, we ﬁnd the turning point that is closest to vt as\n(v1\nt+1)∗ (subﬁgure (b) of Fig. 7). If there is some candidate\ninitial vertices within τ distance to vt, the closest candidate\ninitial vertex is treated as (v1\nt+1)∗(subﬁgure (c) of Fig. 7). Note\nthat the above algorithm is only utilized to generate the training\nlabel and does not affect the graph updating process during\ninference.\nWhen the agent ﬁnishes exploring the current road segment,\nit switches to the intersection-mode and ﬁnds incident road seg-\nments. For each incident road segment, the point whose distance\nis τ′away from vt is deﬁned as the label vertex (subﬁgure (d) of\nFig. 7). Usually there will be multiple (vi\nt+1)∗when RNGDet is\nin the intersection-mode (i.e., V∗= {(vi\nt+1)∗}M\ni=1 and M >1).\nF . Loss functions\nAt each step, RNGDet predicts two segmentation maps as\nwell as coordinates and valid probability of vertices at the next\nstep. Thus, in our experiment three loss functions are utilized\nto train RNGDet. Suppose the predicted segmentation maps are\n7\nˆSand ˆIwhile the ground-truth segmentation masks are S∗and\nI∗, then we have\nLseg = L( ˆS,S∗) + L(ˆI,I∗), (2)\nwhere L is focal loss [49]. Similarly, suppose the ground-truth\nvertices at the next step t+ 1 are {v∗\nj}M\nj=1 and the predictions\nare {ˆvi}N\ni=1, where M ≤N. They can be matched by solving\na bipartite matching problem through minimizing the following\nfunction:\nˆσ= argmin\nσ\nN∑\ni\nLmatch(ˆvi,v∗\nσ), (3)\nwhere σ is the index of v∗ matched with ˆvi, and Lmatch cal-\nculates pair wise Euclidean distance. After the vertex matching,\nwe have the L1 loss as\nLcoord = 1\nN\nN∑\ni\n|ˆvi −v∗\nσ|. (4)\nRNGDet also predicts the valid probability ˆpi of each ˆvi, and\nonly vertices with high enough ˆpi will be used to update the\nroad network graph. The ground-truth value of ˆpi is 1 if ˆvi is\nmatched with a v∗\nσ, otherwise the ground-truth value of ˆpi is 0\n(i.e., ˆvi does not matched with any v∗). Binary cross entropy\nloss is utilized to optimize ˆpi:\nLvalid = BCELoss( ˆP,P∗), (5)\nwhere ˆP = {ˆpi}M\ni=1 and P∗ = {p∗\ni}M\ni=1. The ﬁnal loss\nfunction training RNGDet is the weighted summation of the\naforementioned loss functions:\nL= Lseg + αLcoord + βLvalid, (6)\nwhere, α and β balance the loss function. We have α= 5 and\nβ = 1 in our experiments.\nG. Training data sampling\nTo obtain the training dataset for RNGDet, we propose a\nbehavior-cloning-based algorithm to explore the ground-truth\nroad network graph to generate training samples. Suppose the\nagent is now at vt, we then crop the ROI on IA, crop S∗ on\nthe ground-truth road segment segmentation mask, crop I∗ on\nthe ground-truth road intersection segmentation mask, crop and\nrasterize G for H, and calculate the ground-truth vertices as\nwell as valid probability at the next time step (i.e., V∗ and\nP∗) based on aforementioned approaches. Then, one training\nsample (ROI, H,S∗,I∗,V∗,P∗) is obtained. If the agent is in\nthe road-segment-mode and the ground-truth vertex at the next\ntime step (v1\nt+1)∗ is an intersection point, we use (v1\nt+1)∗ to\nupdate the graph (i.e., the agent moves to (v1\nt+1)∗); otherwise\nwe add (vi\nt+1)∗ with Gaussian noises ∆ to update the graph\n(i.e., the agent moves to (vi\nt+1)∗+ ∆). The agent is driven to\nexplore road networks by this behavior-cloning-based sampling\nalgorithm, and the generated samples are used to train RNGDet.\nIV. E XPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\nA. Dataset\nIn this paper, all the experiments are conducted on the Road-\nTracer dataset [14]. The dataset contains 300 high-resolution\naerial images (60cm/pixel) obtained from Google map, and the\nground-truth road network graphs are from the OpenStreetMap\n(OSM). All the data has been converted to the image coordinate\nsystem. This dataset covers 40 cities (e.g., Los Angeles and\nBoston). Each aerial image has 3 channels and is 4096 ×4096-\nsized. A city may be composed of multiple aerial images.\nB. Implementation\nTo obtain the dataset to train RNGDet, we run the pro-\nposed data sampling algorithm to explore the ground-truth road\nnetwork graph of the training aerial images and generate the\ntraining samples. At each step, Gaussian noise is added for\ngraph updating in order to make RNGDet more robust. Finally,\nthe training set contains around 300K samples from different\naerial images. We split 10K samples from the training set as\nthe validation data.\nIn our experiment, we set the crop size of ROI as 256 (i.e.,\nL = 256 ) to trade-off between effectiveness and efﬁciency.\nWhen we generate the training labels, τ is set as 40 pixels\nand τ′ is set as 20 pixels. For the transformer, the number of\ninput vertex queries is 10 (i.e., |Q|= N = 10 ). RNGDet is\ntrained with a learning rate as 10−4 and a decay rate as 10−5\nfor 50 epochs. We evaluate the performance of RNGDet on the\nvalidation set at the end of each epoch. All the experiments are\nconducted on 4 RTX-3090 GPUs.\nC. Baselines\nWe compare our proposed RNGDet with two segmentation-\nbased approaches and three graph-based approaches.\n• ImprovedRoad [8] (CVPR 2019): ImprovedRoad is one of\nthe state-of-the-art segmentation-based approaches in the\npast. Orientation information is used to enhance the road\nsegmentation, and it trains an extra reﬁne network to ﬁx\nincorrect road segmentation predictions.\n• SPIN RoadMapper [11] (ICRA 2022): Based on Improve-\ndRoad, SPIN RoadMapper proposes a graph reasoning\nscheme to further capture spatial information of the aerial\nimage. ImprovedRoad and SPIN RoadMapper are trained\nfor 120 epochs. These two approaches usually suffer from\npoor topology correctness.\n• RoadTracer [14] (CVPR 2018): RoadTracer is believed to\nbe the ﬁrst graph-based approach. It predicts the directions\nof the vertices at the next step as a multi-class classiﬁcation\nproblem. However, it has a ﬁxed step size and the train-\ning label generation algorithm may produce inappropriate\nlabels.\n• VecRoad [17] (CVPR 2020): VecRoad is an improved\nversion of RoadTracer, and is the state-of-the-art graph-\nbased approach. It predicts the distribution of the vertices\nat the next step, which allows ﬂexible step size. But it is\nstill two-stage and cannot be optimized in an end-to-end\nmanner. Moreover, it may not be able to distinguish vertices\nthat are close to each other.\n8\n• Sat2Graph [16] (ECCV 2020): Sat2Graph proposes a new\ngraph encoding scheme and designs deep neural networks\nto predict the graph encoding of the input image. The\npredicted graph encoding can be decoded into road network\ngraphs with satisfactory accuracy. However, it suffers from\nthe isomorphic encoding issue which is analyzed in [16],\nand it has relatively inferior performance when arc roads\nare encountered please refer to the fourth row of Fig. 8 as\nan example).\nD. Evaluation metrics\nIn our experiments, we use three metrics pixel-precision\n(P-P), pixel-recall (P-R) and pixel-F1-score (P-F) for pixel-\nlevel evaluation, three metrics intersection-precision (I-P),\nintersection-recall (I-R) and intersection-F1-score (I-F) for in-\ntersection point evaluation and one metric average path length\nsimilarity (APLS) [50] for topology correctness evaluation.\nTo calculate the pixel-level metric scores, we rasterize the\nground-truth graph and the predicted graph as binary images\nB∗ and ˆB, respectively. For a pixel in B∗, if there exists a\npixel in ˆB and the Euclidean distance between them is smaller\nthan δ, then this pixel is treated as correctly retrieved. Similarly,\nif a pixel in ˆB can ﬁnd a pixel in B∗ within δ distance, then\nwe say this pixel is correctly detected. In this way, P-P, P-R and\nP-F can be obtained by the following equations:\nP-P = |{p|∥p,q∥<δ, ∃q∈B∗,∀p∈ ˆB}|\n|ˆB|\n,\nP-R = |{p|∥p,q∥<δ, ∃q∈ ˆB,∀p∈B∗}|\n|B∗| ,\nP-F = 2P-P ·P-R\nP-P + P-R,\n(7)\nwhere ∥·∥ calculates the Euclidean distance and |·| is the\ncardinality of a set. Threshold δ measures the level of error\ntolerance, and we show the metric scores with δ as 2, 5 and 10\npixels for more comprehensive evaluation.\nI-P, I-R and I-F are calculated in a similar way as the\naforementioned pixels-level metrics. The only difference is that\ninstead of rasterizing the whole graph into binary images B∗\nand ˆB, these three metrics only care about intersection points\n(i.e., rasterized binary images only contain intersection points).\nThese three metrics evaluate the ability of approaches to detect\nroad intersections. We also show these metric scores in our\nexperimental results with different δ.\nAPLS measures the similarity of the ground-truth graph G∗\nand the predicted graph ˆG. It samples multiple vertex pairs on\nboth graphs and compares the difference between the shortest\ndistance of vertex pairs. APLS is calculated by the following\nequation:\nAPLS = 1 − 1\nNs\nNs∑\nmin\n(\n1,|L(a,b) −L(a′,b′)|\nL(a,b)\n)\n, (8)\nwhere (a,b) demonstrates a vertex pair sampled from G∗ and\n(a′,b′) is the corresponding vertex pair sampled from ˆG. The\nnumber of sampled vertex pairs is denoted by Ns, and L(·,·)\ncalculates the length of the shortest path between two vertices.\nHigher APLS indicates better graph similarity and topology\ncorrectness.\nE. Comparative results\nRNGDet is compared with ﬁve baseline approaches, includ-\ning two segmentation-based baselines and three graph-based\nbaselines. The quantitative comparison results are shown in\nTab. I. In Tab. I, besides baseline approaches, we also evaluate\nRNGDet with different backbones (i.e., ResNet-34, ResNet-50\nand ResNet-101) for more fair and comprehensive comparison.\nQualitative visualizations are provided in Fig. 8.\nFor segmentation results, we ﬁrst predict the segmentation\nmap, and then binarize it by thresholding. Finally, we run\nskeletonization algorithms to extract the graph of predicted seg-\nmentation maps. From the comparison results, we ﬁnd that these\napproaches have good pixel-level results since they directly opti-\nmize pixel-level segmentation. However, since they cannot fully\nutilize spatial and geometric information, they have poor per-\nformance on topology correctness. Thus segmentation-based ap-\nproaches have relatively inferior intersection-level and topology-\nlevel scores. Therefore, segmentation-based approaches are not\nsufﬁcient for our road network graph detection task.\nGraph-based approaches directly optimize the graph, thus\nthey present much better results from the topology perspective.\nRoadTracer has a ﬁxed step length, which makes it unable to\nhandle some scenarios very well, especially when the agent\nis near road intersections. VecRoad is more powerful due to\nthe use of Res2Net [51] backbone network and the ﬂexible\nstep size. However, VecRoad predicts vertices by ﬁnding local\npeaks on heatmaps, so when vertices are very close to each\nother, it may not be able to correctly detect them. Therefore,\nit may fail to correctly detect some precise graph structures.\nSat2Graph presents good results on straight road detection, but\nit cannot handle curve roads very well, which degrades its\nﬁnal performance (please refer to the fourth row of Fig. 8 as\nan example). Our proposed RNGDet can directly output the\ncoordinates of vertices, therefore RNGDet can handle more\ncomplicated situations and has more powerful performance.\nRNGDet with ResNet-101 backbone has the best performance\nduring evaluation, gaining 2-5% improvement on almost all\nmetrics scores compared with past state-of-the-art approaches.\nRNGDet with ResNet-50 backbone has a little bit inferior\nperformance, but it still outperforms VecRoad except APLS.\nRNGDet with ResNet-34 backbone presents unsatisfactory re-\nsults, which may be caused by the shallow backbone network\nand FPN segmentation heads.\nF . Ablation studies\nIn this section, we study the signiﬁcance of some components\nof our network design, including the road segment segmenta-\ntion S, road intersection segmentation I and the transformer\nstructure of RNGDet. All ablation studies are conducted on\nRNGDet with ResNet-101 backbone. The quantitative results\nof our ablation studies are shown in Tab. II.\nFirst, we completely remove the segmentation heads from\nRNGDet. From the evaluation results, we notice that the perfor-\nmance of RNGDet drops a lot because the segmentation heads\ncan provide strong supervision to assist the CNN backbone to\nextract features of the input. Then, we evaluate RNGDet by\nonly removing the road segment segmentation S. All metrics\nscores degrade, especially pixel-level metrics scores.

This ﬁgure is best viewed in color. Please zoom in for details.\nwe remove the road intersection segmentation I only, and\nthe intersection-level metrics scores and APLS are severely\nharmed. Because Iis critical to make RNGDet aware of road\nintersections, removing I will lead to incorrect connections\nnear road intersections and make the topology correctness much\nworse. In this way, the necessity of the segmentation maps\nincluding Sand Iis veriﬁed.\nFinally, to examine the importance of the transformer struc-\nture in RNGDet, we replace the transformer with a modiﬁed\nMask-RCNN [52].

Thus, RNGDet with Mask-RCNN\ncannot be optimized in an end-to-end way either, which affects\nits ﬁnal performance. From the experimental results, RNGDet\nwith Mask-RCNN presents inferior results compared with the\noriginal RNGDet. Therefore, the importance of the transformer\nstructure is proved.\nG. Number of vertex queries\nUnder normal circumstances, the number of queries |Q|\nshould be obviously larger than the maximum number of\nvertices at the next time step. Usually, the road intersections\nhave at most 5 roads incident with each other. Thus, we try\nto train RNGDet with 5, 10 and 20 queries and observe the\nobtained performance. We use RNGDet with ResNet-101 for\nthe experiments. During the experiments, we use metrics P-F\n(δ= 5), I-F ( δ= 5) and APLS to evaluate models.\nBased on the results shown in Tab. III, RNGDet with 10\ninput queries presents the best performance, thus the number of\nqueries is set to 10.\nTABLE III: The quantitative results of RNGDet with different\nnumbers of queries ( |Q|).\nP-F ↑ I-F ↑ APLS ↑\nRNGDet with 5 queries 73.10 61.74 62.78\nRNGDet with 10 queries 73.67 65.89 67.88\nRNGDet with 20 queries 73.90 64.27 65.31\nH. Failure cases\nAlthough RNGDet presents superiority against past ap-\nproaches, it still cannot handle some very complicated cases,\nsuch as occluded overpasses, very well yet. Moreover, RNGDet\nalso suffers from the drifting issue of imitation learning (i.e.,\nwhen the agent is away from the right track, it may not be\nable to get back to the correct state) similar to other graph-\nbased approaches, even though it can relieve this problem to\nsome extent. Some example visualizations of failure cases of\nRNGDet are shown in Fig. 9. These cases could be handled in\nthe future with more powerful backbone networks or training\nstrategies.\nV. C ONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK\nWe proposed here RNGDet, a novel iterative approach to\nautomatically detect the road network graph from aerial images.\nTaken as input an aerial image, RNGDet could directly output\nthe road network graph with vertices and edges. First, RNGDet\npredicted a set of candidate initial vertices, and then iteratively\ngenerated the road network graph vertex-by-vertex starting from\neach candidate initial vertex. Due to the use of transformer and\ndeep queries, RNGDet could handle complicated intersection\npoints with an arbitrary number of incident road segments.\nRNGDet was evaluated on a publicly available dataset and\npresented the state-of-the-art performance in terms of all eval-\nuation metrics, including pixel-level metrics, intersection-level\nmetrics and topology-level metric APLS. The experimental\nresults demonstrated the superiority of our work. In the future,\nwe would like to further improve RNGDet by using more\npowerful backbone networks and training strategies. Besides,\nwe will adapt RNGDet to other graph detection tasks, such as\nroad laneline detection and road lane centerline detection.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Y .-Y . Chiang and C. A.
