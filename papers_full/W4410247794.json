  "abstract": "Purpose In the context of psychotherapy, emotions play an important role both through their association with symptom severity, as well as their effects on the therapeutic relationship. In this analysis, we aim to train a large language model (LLM) for the detection of emotions in German speech. We want to apply this model on a corpus of psychotherapy transcripts to predict symptom severity and alliance aiming to identify the most important emotions for the prediction of symptom severity and therapeutic alliance. Methods We employed a public labeled dataset of 28 emotions and translated the dataset into German. A pre-trained LLM was then fine-tuned on this dataset for emotion classification. We applied the fine-tuned model to a dataset containing 553 psychotherapy sessions of 124 patients. Using machine learning (ML) and explainable artificial intelligence (AI), we predicted symptom severity and alliance by the detected emotions. Results Our fine-tuned model achieved modest classification performance ( F1 macro =0.45, Accuracy =0.41, Kappa =0.42) across the 28 emotions. Incorporating all emotions, our ML model showed satisfying performance for the prediction of symptom severity ( r = .50; 95%-CI:.42,.57) and moderate performance for the prediction of alliance scores ( r = .20; 95%-CI:.06,.32). The most important emotions for the prediction of symptom severity were approval, anger , and fear . The most important emotions for the prediction of alliance were curiosity, confusion , and surprise . Conclusions Even though the classification results were only moderate, our model achieved a good performance especially for prediction of symptom severity. The results confirm the role of negative emotions in the prediction of symptom severity, while they also highlight the role of positive emotions in fostering a good alliance.

There are qualitative differences\nbetween emotions based on the opportunity or challenge that the\nemotion has been evolved to address, as well as its expression (2).\nFurther, emotions can immediately impact behavior, quickly\nregulating one’s behavior based on the situation (3). For instance,\nanger may be an adaptive reaction to an unfair treatment (4),\nprompting the person at which it is targeted to change their\nbehavior according to the demand. Simultaneously, anger comes\nwith speciﬁc facial features (5) and associated behaviors, such as\nspeaking forcefully or even yelling.\nSince emotions are an essential part of daily functioning, it is\nimportant that individuals are able to regulate them, that is,\nmodulate the emotional experience and its expression (1). People\nwho lack this ability, may be compromised in several domains of\nlife, which could negatively affect mental health (1, 6). Therefore, it\ncomes as no surprise that many mental health disorders are\nassociated with emotion regulation deﬁcits (7).\nBecause of the importance of emotion regulation processes\nacross various mental health disorders, emotions play an essential\nrole in psychotherapy (8). Most importantly, they are associated\nwith symptom severity in mood and anxiety disorders (9–11). Even\nthough, emotions and affect can be differentiated (e.g., affect is\nlonger in duration, is less intentional, tends to have unknown\ncauses, and has lower intensity), there is substantial overlap\nbetween both constructs (9). For instance, the correlation between\nfear (emotion) and anxiety (affect) was calculated as r = .72,\namounting to more than 50% of shared variance (10). Therefore,\nthe measurement of someone’s emotions can provide an estimate of\ntheir affect. Simultaneously, dysregulated affect is an important\nfeature in anxiety and depression (11), which are characterized by\nexcessive negative (NA) and a lack of positive affect (PA). Generally,\naffect is sensitive to change: In a meta-analysis, psychotherapy for\ndepression has been shown to decrease NA and increase PA (12).\nAccording to the broaden-and-built theory, PA helps to\nstrengthen and build resources by extending one’st h o u g h t - a c t i o n\nrepertoire (13). For instance, PA comes with the urge to play, explore,\nsavor, and connect, all of which can foster resources through the\ncreation of new opportunities and strengthening of relationships.\nThis, in turn, raises wellbeing and PA (13). Consequently, it is not\nsurprising that PA can protect against depression (14), may mediate\ndepression recovery (15), and that lack of PA is associated with\ntypical depression symptoms, such as sadness, loss of interest, little\nenergy, and apathy (16\n, 17). Conversely, NA is linked with stress\nlevels (18) and depressive symptoms (19). NA is a better predictor of\ndepression deterioration than PA, differentiates better between\ndepressed and healthy individuals ( 20), and predicts future\ndepression onset while PA does not (21). Therefore, NA is likely a\nbetter marker for symptom severity than PA.\nBeyond their association with symptom severity, emotions play\nanother crucial role in the context of psychotherapy through their\nimpact on the therapeutic alliance, which is one of the best predictors\nof successful treatment (22). Human beings are fundamentally social\ncreatures and emotions are an essential mechanism for the regulation\nof social relationships ( 23). Much of the adaptive strength of\nemotions is mediated by their effects on interpersonal functioning\nso that they can be described as intrinsically interpersonal (24):\nEmotion expression helps people to recognize our needs and\nwishes, allowing them to support us and strengthening the mutual\nbond. However, positive interpersonal effects of emotion expression\nare not automatically given, but depend on several crucial factors\n(23). In particular, emotion regulation plays an important role: For\ninstance, individuals with high levels of NA report more difﬁcult and\nless satisfying romantic relationships (25). Though negative emotions\ncan play an adaptive role as well, the excessive expression of NA can\nbe devastating for romantic relationships, because it perpetuates a\nreciprocal spiral, from which it is difﬁcult to disengage (26). Similarly,\nthe expression of negative sentiment towards the therapist or the\ntherapeutic situation is associated with lower levels of alliance (27,\n28). Depressed mood is associated with lower levels of emotion\nregulation, which can lead to anger management difﬁculties, reduced\ntrust and forgiveness, heightened levels of social comparison, as well\nas social withdrawal, all of which can impair social functioning and\ntherefore harm the therapeutic relationship (29). In summary, patient\nemotions associated with either withdrawal or confrontation and\ncriticism may be particular harmful to the alliance (30). For example,\npatients with a lot of shame tend to withdraw, which leads to negative\neffects on the alliance (31), while anger, hostility, and frustration can\nimpair the alliance via confrontation and criticism (27, 28).\nContrary, positive emotions serve important social functions,\nw h i c hc a ni m p r o v et h et h e r a p e u t i ca l l i a n c e(32–35). Most\nimportantly, they can increase intimacy and emotional bond, as\nwell as enhance motivation to achieve shared goals (35), both of\nwhich are pillars of the working alliance (36). These considerations\nare conﬁrmed through longitudinal studies, that have shown\nbidirectional effects between positive emotions and alliance (32,\n34). Though we did notﬁnd results regarding the relative strength\nof negative and positive emotions on the therapeutic relationship, it\nis likely that negative emotions may have the greater impact, since\nnegative events tend to have greater effects on most areas of life,\nincluding interpersonal relations (37).\nEmotions can be assessed via many different means, including\nvideo, audio, electroencephalography (for an overview see 38),\nelectromyography, various other physiological measures (e.g., heart\nrate, blood pressure), or a combination of several modalities (39–41).\nDifferent methods have been successfully employed depending on the\ndata source. For electroencephalography (see 38), features can be\nemployed for machine learning from different domains, such as the\ntime, frequency, or both. Additionally, employing deep learning, the\nraw data can be used without feature engineering. For instance, using\nfrequency features, good accuracy (>80%) has been achieved both for\nthe classiﬁcation of valence and arousal (42). Similar approaches are\npossible for other physiological data ( 39). For video emotion\nclassiﬁcation, deep learning models show competitive performance\nwith a convolutional neural network achieving 66% accuracy in a facial\nclassiﬁcation (43). In the voice domain, a combination of convolutional\nneural networks and a transformer architectures (wav2vec 2.0;44)\nLalk et al. 10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1504306\nFrontiers inPsychiatry frontiersin.org02\nshows state-of-the-art performance across various tasks (45). For text\ndata, current models successfullyemploy a transformer architecture\n(e.g., 46).\nHowever, better results can be achieved for multimodal models.\nFor instance, automatic classiﬁcation of basic emotions based on text,\nspeech, and video in a hidden Markov model achieved good accuracy\nin an experimental setting ( 47). Regarding a naturalistic\npsychotherapy setting, emotions were mainly assessed via\nquestionnaire measures ( 48) with notable exceptions, where\nemotions were judged by human raters (e.g., 49, 50). However,\nboth of these approaches have drawbacks: Questionnaire measures\ncan be burdensome for patients and are unable to track emotions over\nthe course of a session. While human raters can indeed track\nemotions over the session, this is very time-consuming, so that it is\ndifﬁcult to apply to large session datasets. With the emergence of\nartiﬁcial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP),\nnew approaches for the automatic analyses of large language corpora\nare available (51). NLP has already shown promising success in the\nidenti ﬁcation of therapist skills ( 52), motivational interview\nadherence (53), or relevant session themes (54, 55). In the context\nof emotion detection, M. Tanana et al. (56) trained uni-, bi-, and\ntrigram1 models on the detection of sentiment on 100,000 rated\nutterances from psychotherapy transcripts. This work was later\nextended by the inclusion of the transformer model Bidirectional\nEncoder Representations and Transformations (BERT;57)a n da\nmodel based on positive and negative affective words from the\nLinguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC;58). In this analysis,\nthe BERT model showed the best performance (59). More recently,\nE b e r h a r d te ta l .(60) validated the performance of another\ntransformer model on a set of 85 transcripts. They found\nsigniﬁcant correlations between automatically calculated sentiment\nand patient- and therapist-reported emotions. Further, symptom\nseverity was signiﬁcantly associated with negative sentiment.\nWhile these results provide evidence for the reliability and\nvalidity of sentiment analysis, they are restricted to the valence\ndimension, classifying all utterance on a single dimension from\nnegative to positive. Though the valence dimension is highly\nrelevant in this context, at least six basic emotions can be\ndistinguished with additional affect states ( 2), that can be\norganized across multiple dimensions (e.g., valence, intensity,\nintentionality, duration) and mul tiple categories (e.g., causes,\nfunction, mimic, behavior).\nObjectives\nTherefore, we aim toﬁne-tune a large language model (LLM)\nfor a more ﬁne-grained analysis of emotions in the German\nlanguage. We want to show the clinical utility of this approach by\napplying this model to a dataset of psychotherapy sessions to\npredict symptom severity and alliance, employing explainable AI\nto identify the most important emotions for the prediction of both.\nHypotheses\nWe expect ourﬁne-tuned German model to accurately capture\nemotions in the transcript, allowing for a prediction of patient\nsymptom severity. Regarding symptom severity, we expect negative\nemotions to predict higher symptom severity and positive emotions\nto predict lower symptom severity. Further, we expect negative\nemotions to have a higher impact on the prediction of symptom\nseverity than positive emotions. Regarding the alliance, we expect\npositive emotions to predict better alliance. For negative emotions,\nwe expect lower levels of alliance in general, though particularly for\nemotions associated with withdrawal (such as embarrassment and\nconfusion) or confrontation (such as anger and disapproval). Again,\nwe expected negative emotions to have a higher impact on the\nalliance scores.\nMethods\nPatients and therapists\nOur dataset contained 124 patients (65.8% female) who had\nreceived treatment at an universi ty outpatient clinic in Trier,\nGermany. On average, patients were 38.8 years (SD = 12.7) old.\nRegarding the socioeconomic status, almost all had eitherﬁnished a\nsecondary school certiﬁcate (51.6%) or their A-levels (42.1%). Most\nhad ﬁnished an apprenticeship (41.3%), while 18.2% were currently\nin training or studying and 11.6% had a university degree. All\npatients underwent a diagnostic interview employing the Structured\nClinical Interview for Axis I DSM-IV Disorders-Patient Edition\n(SCID-I; 61). They were mostly diagnosed with primary diagnoses\nof affective disorders (n = 56), anxiety disorders (n = 24), and\ntrauma and adjustment disorders ( n = 16). On average, they\nreceived 2.3 (SD = 1.3,min =1 ,max = 5) comorbid diagnoses.\nThe treatment was conducted by 47 therapists with a\npsychology master degree. All therapists had at least one year of\nprior treatment experience and were either already licensed CBT\ntherapists or currently enrolled in training. They received\nsupervision regularly.\nTreatment\nThe treatment consisted of weekly CBT sessions. While theﬁrst\ntwo sessions served diagnostic purposes (initial assessment in session\n1 and SCID-I interview in session 2), the treatment began in the third\nsession. On average, patients received 35.7 (SD = 19.7) sessions.\nInstruments and measures\nSymptom severity\nPrior to each session, symptom severity was assessed via the\nHopkins Symptom Checklist-11 (HSCL-11;62). The HSCL-11 is an\n11-item self-report scale about general psychological distress. Patients1 N-grams refer to sets ofn consecutive words in a corpus.\nLalk et al. 10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1504306\nFrontiers inPsychiatry frontiersin.org03\nrated a list of 11 symptoms (fearfulness, anxiousness, agitation, panic,\nsleep problems, hopelessness, loneliness, low mood, lack of interest,\nsuicidal ideation, and worthlessness) on a Likert-type scale from 1\n(not at all)t o4( extremely). Symptom severity was then calculated as\nthe mean score on these items. The HSCL-11 contains a depression\nand anxiety subscale and is highly correlated with various other\nanxiety and depression questionnaires ( 63). For instance, high\nassociations have been found for the Brief Symptom Inventory\n(BSI; 64; r = .91) and its subscales for anxiety ( r = .82) and\ndepression (r = .91). Regarding depression, high correlations have\nalso been found for the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9;65; r\n= .81). For worry symptoms, high correlations exist with the\nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7;66; r =. 7 2 ) .T h eH S C L -\n11 has shown good sensitivity to change (67). Assessing the third\nsession of each patient in this sample, we also found good internal\nconsistency (w = .92) according to McDonald’so m e g a(68). Across all\nsessions in our dataset, average symptom severity was at 2.2 (SD =\n0.79) on a scale from 1 to 4.\nAlliance\nTherapeutic alliance was assessed by the patient via the Session\nRating Scale (SRS;69). The patientsﬁlled the questionnaire after each\nsession. The SRS contains the conceptualization by Bordin (36)o f\nthree alliance components: 1. Affective bond, 2. Goal agreement, 3.\nTask agreement, which are assessed by three items. The SRS contains\nan additional fourth item, which reﬂects the overall alliance. Theﬁnal\nscore is calculated as a mean across all four items. The SRS has shown\ngenerally satisfying reliability, ranging froma = .70 to.97 and a test-\nretest reliability betweenr = .54 and.70 (70). In our sample, the SRS\nshowed a good internal consistency in the third session (w =. 8 3 ) .\nCorrelations with other alliance measures have been moderate\n(HAQ-II; r =. 4 8 ;69;W A I ;r =. 5 7–.65; 71).\nTranscripts\nThe transcripts corpus consisted of 553 transcripts of\npsychotherapy sessions. On average, there were 4.5 (SD = 4.9)\ntranscripts per patient, generally starting with session 3 and\ncontinuing with everyﬁfth session (e.g., 3, 5, 10,… ).\nTranscription was conducted without the use of transcription\nsoftware by psychology studentsbased on the session recordings.\nNames of persons or places were removed to reduce identiﬁable\ninformation. The transcripts contained sparse annotations about\nnonverbal behavior or interru ption in parentheses. Each\ntranscript was organized as a table of consecutive speech turns\nby therapist and patient. The transcripts were not labelled for\nemotions. For our analysis, we retained only the patients’speech\nturns, leaving 104,557 speech turns. We further split these speech\nturns into sentences for the model inference and retained all\nsentences with at least three words, leaving 233,648 sentences.\nAverage sentence length was 12.7 (SD = 10.4) words. Per session,\npatients spoke on average 422.5 ( SD = 174.1) sentences,\namounting to 5,362.6 (SD = 2,089.3) words.\nGoEmotions dataset\nWe used theGoEmotions dataset (72) as our labeled training\ndata. The dataset consists of 54k labeled comments. All comments\nwere taken from Reddit, while excluding offensive, vulgar, religion,\nand identity words. Comments had a length between 3 and 30\nwords and were balanced across the sentiment, different emotions,\nand subreddits. The comments were annotated by three raters\nacross a list of 28 emotions (or respectively 27 emotions and a\n‘neutral’category). If reasonable, multiple labels could be given to a\nsingle comment. Interrater agreement was assessed via Cohen’s\nkappa by Demszky et al. (72), ranging between 0.331 (grief) and\n0.468 (admiration). As is shown inFigure 1, the posts were not well\nbalanced across all emotions with especially neutral and admiration\nand approval being the most prevalent ones, while relief, pride and\ngrief were very rare.\nXLM-RoBERTa-base language model\nWe employed theXLM-RoBERTa-base model (73) as our base\nLLM, which weﬁne-tuned on the dataset. TheXLM-RoBERTa-base\nmodel was trained on a masked multilingual dataset of over 2\nterabyte (of which 66.6 gigabyte were in German), which allows the\nmodel to perform in over 100 languages. The model has an\nembedding size of 1024 tokens, corresponding to a maximal input\ncontext length of about 600–800 words. TheXLM-RoBERTa-base\nmodel was pretrained with a Masked Language Modeling objective\nby predicting 15% of rando mly masked words to learn a\nbidirectional representation of the sentence. Since it was only\ntrained on raw texts without human labeling, it is intended to be\nﬁne-tuned on a downstream task, such as the classiﬁcation task that\nis contained in this paper.\nData analytic strategy\nThe analyses were conducted with Python 3.9. The complete\nworkﬂow is shown inFigure 2and is elaborated below.\nPre-processing and large language modelﬁne-\ntuning\nWe selected the 54k labeled comments from the rawGoEmotions\ndataset and used automatic translation to German via DeepL (74).\nThe dataset was split into 80% training set, 10% validation set, and\n10% test set. Emotions were classiﬁed to a comment via one-hot\nencoding2.W et h e nﬁne-tuned the XLM-RoBERTa-base model on\nthe data in a multilabel classiﬁcation task (i.e., several emotions could\nbe classiﬁed to one sentence) with a batch size of 16, learning rate of\n3e–5, and weight decay of 0.01. The complete training code can be\naccessed via the OSF repository (75). Training was conducted for 10\nepochs in the dataset format, which allows for faster processing speed\n(76). The loss function was Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) with logits\nbecause of the multilabel implementation.\nLalk et al. 10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1504306\nFrontiers inPsychiatry frontiersin.org04\nThe ﬁnal model showed similar metrics in the test set (F1macro =\n0.45, Kappamacro = 0.42, Accuracy = 0.41) as the original model\n(F1macro = 0.46) by Demszky et al. (72). Cohen’s Kappa calculated\nbetween predicted emotions and labeled emotions ranged between\n0.15 and 0.88 with a mean of 0.42, indicating moderate agreement\n(77). The confusion matrix in theﬁnal test set is shown inFigure 3.\nLarge language model inference\nAfter theﬁne-tuning was completed, we applied the model for\nthe emotion classiﬁcation in our dataset. As the labeled data had a\nlength of 3 to 30 words, we decided to conduct the classiﬁcation on a\nsentence level. Each sentence by a patient was then run through the\nmodel pipeline and was classiﬁed across the 28 different emotions\nby assigning each emotion a probability between 0 and 1 for each\nsentence. For example, if a sentence was given a probability of 0.8\nfor admiration , this could be interpreted as the predicted\nprobability for the presence of admiration in the sentence.\nTherefore, higher values correspond to a higher probability for\nthe presence of a given emotion.\nEvaluation strategy for the prediction of outcome\nFor the prediction of outcome (i.e., alliance and symptom\nseverity), the automatically classiﬁed emotion probabilities were\naggregated at a session level by calculating the mean for each\nemotion per session. Since the symptom severity measure\ncontained a depression and an anxiety subscale, we conducted\ntwo sensitivity analyses, predicting the respective subscale. The 28\naggregated emotion probabilities were the features for the\nprediction. Employing nested cross-validation, several machine\nlearning algorithms competed against each other in an internal\nﬁve-fold cross-validation, while only the best performing algorithm\nwas selected as the algorithm of choice for the respective test set in\nthe external ten-fold cross-validation via the python library XRAI\n(78). We evaluated the model performance via correlation (r; 79),\nnormalized root mean squared error (NRMSE; 80), and mean\nabsolute error (MAE; 81). For the NRMSE, normalization was\nconducted by dividing through the standard deviation of the\ntarget variable. Con ﬁdence intervals were calculated by\nbootstrapping across the ten test folds.\nMachine learning algorithms\nIn order to achieve good prediction metrics, we chose a diverse\nset of ML algorithms to account for feature interactions, nonlinear\neffects and collinearity. The following machine learning algorithms\ncompeted against each other in the internal cross-validation: 1.\nLeast Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso;82), 2.\nElastic net regularization and variable selection (Elastic Net;83), 3.\neXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost;84), 4. Random Forest (RF;\n85), 5. Support Vector Regression (SVR;86), and 6. SuperLearner\n(87). The SuperLearner integrates the ensemble of previous learners\n(i.e., Lasso, Elastic Net, XGB oost, RF, and SVR), using their\npredicted scores as features for an SVR meta-learner.\n2 One-Hot encoding is the transformation of categorial data into binary\nvectors for each category. Contrary to dummy encoding, there is no\nreference category.\nFIGURE 1\nBarplot of the emotion frequency in the train set of GoEmotions.\nLalk et al. 10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1504306\nFrontiers inPsychiatry frontiersin.org05\nOut of these six different algorithms, the machine learning\nalgorithm with the best mean correlation in the internalﬁve-fold\ncross-validation was selected as the algorithm for the external test\nfold. Therefore, it could be possible that different algorithms were\nselected across the ten test folds, e.g.,ﬁve times XGBoost, three\ntimes RF, and two times SVR.\nModel explanation\nIn general, machine-learning models are not very well\nexplainable due to their complex and nonlinear modeling (88).\nHowever, one proposed solution has been the use of Shapley values\n(89), which allow for an estimation of feature impact. To this end,\nwe employed the python package SHAP (SHapley Additive\nexPlanations; 90, 91). SHAP allows for the assessment of the\nindividual feature impact (i.e., how much are the predicted values\ninﬂuenced by this feature)?, as well as the impact of groups of\nfeatures. Further, SHAP can be used to assess the direction of a\nfeature impact (e.g., do higher feature values predict higher\noutcome values)?, as well as interactions between features.\nResults\nDescriptive statistics\nThe mean probability of all emotions and their reliability is\npresented in Table 1. In addition, the valence of each emotion is\nindicated (positive/negative/ neutral). Altogether, the model\nclassi ﬁed 14 positive emotions, 12 negative emotions and 2\nneutral emotions. The most probable emotions in the transcript\ncorpus were (with the exception of neutral) approval (12.98%),\ndisapproval (6.11%), confusion (4.32%), and realization (4.14%).\nThe least probable emotions weregrief (0.11%), remorse (0.27%),\namusement (0.73%), andrelief (0.58%). Regarding the reliability of\nthe assessment, we provided the F1 metric and Cohen’s Kappa (77)\nfrom the test set in theGoEmotions dataset. F1 is the harmonic\nmean between precision (how often is the model correct when it\npredicts the emotion)? and recall (how often does the model detect\nthe emotion when it actually occurs)?. Kappa can be interpreted\naccording to (77) as fair agreement (>.2), moderate agreement (>.4),\nsubstantial agreement (>.6), and almost perfect agreement (>.8).\nReliability was substantially high for some positive emotions (e.g.,\nadmiration, amusement, gratitude, and love), while the negative\nemotions showed moderate agreement at best (e.g.,fear, remorse,\nand sadness).\nTo give some impression about the labeled statements from\npsychotherapy transcripts, we compared some patient statements\nthat were classiﬁed by the LLM with original comments from the\nGoEmotions dataset for different emotions (seeTable 2). Due to\nconﬁdentiality, the psychotherapy statements are from publicly\navailable transcripts. We have provided a full list containing each\nemotion in our OSF (75).\nPrediction of symptom severity\nThe machine learning model containing the 28 emotions as\nfeatures showed a good performance with (r = .50 (95%-CI:.42,.57),\nNRMSE = 0.87 (95%-CI:.83,.91) and MAE = .57 (95%-CI:.55,.59).\nThe selected learners for the external cross-validation were RF (6x)\nand SVR (4x). The most important predictors (see Table 3)a s\ncalculated according to the relative SHAP value were approval\n(9.2%), sadness (8.7%), fear (7.8%), disappointment (6.4%), desire\n(6.3%), andsadness (6.2%). We expected negative emotions to predict\nhigher symptom severity and positive emotions to predict lower\nsymptom severity. This was generally accurate, though some positive\nemotions were associated with higher symptom severity, namely\ndesire, pride, caring, amusement ,a n dlove. Simultaneously, no\nnegative emotion was associat ed with less symptom severity.\nFurther, we expected negative emotions to have a stronger impact\non symptom severity than positive emotions. Altogether,approval,\nadmiration, optimism, realization, excitement, gratitude,a n drelief\nwere positive emotions signiﬁcantly associated with lower symptom\nseverity, pertaining to an aggregated feature impact of 27.0%, while all\nnegative emotions(anger, fear, disappointment, sadness, nervousness,\ndisapproval, annoyance, embarrassment, confusion, disgust, grief, and\nremorse) were signiﬁcantly associated with higher symptom severity\nwith almost twice the aggregated impact of negative emotions\n(51.8%), conﬁrming the hypothesis. The remaining emotions were\nnot signiﬁcantly associated with symptom severity.\nSensitivity analyses for the prediction of\nthe anxiety and the depression subscale\nRegarding the prediction of the anxiety (r = .47, 95%-CI: .40,\n.55) and depression (.53, 95%-CI: .47, .59) subscales, good metrics\nwere achieved. A list of all associated emotions and their relative\nFIGURE 2\nComplete workﬂow for the data analysis (blue represents data and\nyellow the LLMs).

For the\nanxiety subscale, the emotions with the highest positive impact were\nfear (17.3%), sadness (8.6%), andnervousness (7.3%), whileapproval\n(10.4%) and admiration (6.1%) had the highest negative impact.\nRegarding depression, sadness (18.6%), grief (8.0%) and\ndisappointment (7.2%) had the highest positive and approval\n(17.7%) andrealization (4.2%) the highest negative impact.\nPrediction of alliance\nFor the alliance prediction, the model performance was low to\nmoderate with (r = .20 (95%-CI:´.06,.32), NRMSE = 0.98 (95%-\nCI:.95, 1.01) and MAE = 8.76 (95%-CI: 8.34, 9.22). Regarding the\nexternal test set learners, Elastic Net (4x), as well as Lasso (3x) and\nRF (3x) were selected. The emotions with the highest impact (see\nTable 4) were curiosity (24.9%), confusion (16.4%), and surprise\n(5.4%). We expected positive emotions to predict higher alliance\nand negative emotions to predict lower alliance. For negative\nemotions, this was not the case in general, since annoyance,\nremorse, disgust, nervousness, sadness , and embarrassment were\nnot associated with lower alliance. Though,confusion as a marker\nof a withdrawal rupture andanger and disapproval as markers of\nconfrontation ruptures predicted lower alliance. Positive emotions\nwere mostly associated with higher alliance with the notable\nexception of curiosity and approval . Some emotions (e.g.,\noptimism, nervousness )w e r en o ts i g n iﬁcantly associated with\nalliance. We expected negative emotions ( confusion, anger,\ndisapproval, fear, disappointment, grief; 27.5%) to have a greater\nnegative impact on alliance than the positive impact of positive\nemotions ( desire, joy, admiration, excitement, realization,\namusement, relief, love, caring;28.95%), which was not the case.\nDiscussion\nOur study served three purposes: First, weﬁne-tuned an LLM\nfor the classi ﬁcation of 28 emotions in German. Second, we\nemployed this model on a data set of 553 psychotherapy\ntranscripts to predict symptom severity and alliance. Third, we\nassessed the most important emo tions for the predictions of\nsymptom severity and alliance. Our results indicate a modest\nclassiﬁcation performance for ourﬁne-tuned model with F1macro\n= .45, which is almost identical to the original performance in\nEnglish (F1macro = .46), indicating no overall accuracy loss due to\nthe translation. Looking at individual emotions, classi ﬁcation\naccuracy varied slightly, but was mostly similar between German\nand English (the largest decrease inF1macro was .11). The Kappa\nvalue of .42 demonstrated moderate agreement, which is not\nsurprising because of the inherent limitation of identifying\nemotions only via the transcript modality while ignoring other\nmodalities such as voice intonation (audio; e.g., 92)o rf a c i a l\nFIGURE 3\nConfusion matrix in theﬁnal test set. The color grading is exponentially scaled.\nLalk et al. 10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1504306\nFrontiers inPsychiatry frontiersin.org07\nexpression (video; e.g., 93). Therefore, the modest performance\nlikely did result from the low int er-rater-reliability in the\nGoEmotions dataset (Cohen’s Kappa ranging from .33 to .47).\nHowever, there was considerable variation regarding the model’s\nKappa values, ranging between .15 and .88. This seems logical since\nsome emotions may be more clearly expressed via language content\n(e.g., admiration, amusement, fear )t h a no t h e r s( e . g . ,\ndisappointment, annoyance), which might be better captured via\nvoice features or mimic.\nEmploying the ﬁne-tuned model, we successfully predicted\nsymptom severity ( r = .50) and alliance ( r =. 2 0 )f r o mt h e\ntranscripts. The accuracy was comparable to a different approach\nbased on session content as operationalized by topic modeling of\n250 topics ( 55). Emotions showed higher associations with\nsymptom severity than a model based on 14 cognitive distortions\n(r = .33) or negative sentiment only r = .08, 94). In contrast,\nEberhardt et al. (60) found both within-person correlations for\npositive sentiment (r = −.29) and large between-person correlations\nfor negative sentiment (r = .66). However, these correlations must\nbe interpreted with caution as they come from a small dataset (N =\n79) and may not be stable (95).\nRegarding symptom severity, negative emotions mainly\npredicted higher and positive emotions lower symptom severity,\nas expected. For negative emotions, the best predictors wereanger\nand fear, which both come with high arousal. Anger may be\nassociated with the HSCL-11 items agitation, low mood and\nfeeling worthless (as it often was self-directed) whilefear may be\nassociated with various items of the HSCL-11, such as fearfulness,\nanxiousness, agitation, panic, and sleep problems. Surprisingly, the\npositive emotion approval had the highest effect, probably because it\nwas simultaneously the most often detected emotion (13.0%).\nThough content-wise approval was a fuzzy concept with low\nreliability ( Kappa = .29), it tended to be associated with\nstatements of agreement, feasibility, and acceptance, which can be\nprotective factors ( 14, 96). Desire was associated with higher\nsymptom severity, likely because it contained statements that\nindicated a present frustration or lack of something (e.g., desiring\nmore sleep, a more accepting partner, or happiness). Regarding the\nsensitivity analysis for anxiety, we found the highest impact of the\nnegative emotions fear, sadness, and nervousness, while approval\nTABLE 1 Mean probability and standard deviations, as well as F1 and\nkappa values for each emotion.\nEmotion (pos./\nneg./neutral)\nM SD F1 Cohen ’s\nKappa\nadmiration (pos.) 2.35% 1.41% .64 .601\namusement (pos.) 0.73% 0.66% .78 .767\nanger (neg.) 0.88% 0.67% .38 .358\nannoyance (neg.) 3.17% 1.32% .27 .229\napproval (pos.) 12.98% 4.40% .34 .293\ncaring (pos.) 0.79% 0.51% .38 .365\nconfusion (neg.) 4.32% 2.06% .40 .378\ncuriosity (pos.) 2.10% 1.42% .51 .486\ndesire (pos.) 0.58% 0.49% .39 .387\ndisappointment (neg.) 2.31% 1.03% .19 .170\ndisapproval (neg.) 6.11% 2.02% .32 .286\ndisgust (neg.) 0.65% 0.45% .41 .395\nembarrassment (neg.) 0.43% 0.41% .37 .367\nexcitement (pos.) 0.87% 0.55% .35 .339\nfear (neg.) 1.23% 1.09% .59 .584\ngratitude (pos.) 0.40% 0.34% .89 .882\ngrief (neg.) 0.11% 0.19% .31 .307\njoy (pos.) 1.68% 0.97% .51 .499\nlove (pos.) 0.75% 0.69% .73 .721\nnervousness (neg.) 0.91% 0.73% .28 .276\noptimism (pos.) 1.43% 0.72% .53 .512\npride (pos.) 0.24% 0.28% .30 .299\nrealization (pos.) 4.14% 1.66% .17 .150\nrelief (pos.) 0.58% 0.36% .27 .266\nremorse (neg.) 0.27% 0.25% .55 .545\nsadness (neg.) 1.92% 1.18% .50 .488\nsurprise (neutral) 0.50% 0.40% .53 .514\nneutral (neutral) 62.59% 6.13% .60 .410\npos., positive; neg., negative;M , mean;SD, standard deviation.F1, harmonic mean between\nprecision (ratio between correct and total predictions of the emotion) and recall (ratio\nbetween correct predictions and total occurrence of the emotion);Cohen’s Kappa, measure of\nmodel-rater-reliability.

For depression,\napproval also was the most important positive emotion, while\nsadness, grief and disappointment were the most important\nnegative emotions.\nFor alliance, contrary to our expectations, only few negative\nemotions predicted lower alliance, while most positive emotions\npredicted higher alliance. However, as expected, the negative\nemotions with signi ﬁcant associations might have served as\nwithdrawal ( confusion ) or confrontation markers ( anger,\ndisapproval ) .T h en e g a t i v ea s s o c i a t i o nw i t hcuriosity was\nsurprising, especially since it explained about a quarter of the\nmodel impact. Looking at the sentences that were classiﬁed as\ncuriosity , it seemed as if they sometimes indicated a\nmisunderstanding (e.g., “So this is from my diagnosis ?”),\nfrustration (“And you’re a psychologist, or what?” ), or confusion\n(“What will happen to me then?”). The positive impact of positive\nemotions was highlighted by the associations with desire, joy,\nadmiration, andexcitement in line with the literature (35).\nTABLE 3 Symptom severity prediction: emotions, relative SHAP value,\nand correlation with SHAP value.\nEmotion Symptom Severity\nRelative\nSHAP value\nCorrelation with SHAP\nvalue (95%-CI)\napproval 9.16% -.63 (-.69, -.55)\nanger 8.67% .86 (.81,.91)\nfear 7.77% .88 (.84,.92)\ndisappointment 6.42% .79 (.73,.84)\ndesire 6.32% .90 (.85,.95)\nsadness 6.24% .83 (.78,.88)\nadmiration 5.96% -.71 (-.79, -.64)\nnervousness 4.72% .79 (.72,.85)\ndisapproval 3.76% .82 (.78,.86)\nneutral 3.46% -.01 (-.38,.37)\nannoyance 3.38% .89 (.84,.93)\noptimism 3.29% -.78 (-.83, -.73)\nrealization 3.18% -.89 (-.91, -.86)\nembarrassment 2.54% .75 (.67,.83)\nconfusion 2.43% .81 (.73,.87)\nexcitement 2.42% -.56 (-.65, -.47)\ndisgust 2.12% .80 (.75,.85)\npride 2.08% .73 (.65,.81)\ngrief 1.98% .55 (.44,.67)\ncaring 1.92% .29 (.04,.51)\nsurprise 1.90% -.60 (-.79, -.37)\nremorse 1.78% .33 (.04,.57)\njoy 1.62% -.18 (-.40,.02)\ngratitude 1.60% -.47 (-.70, -.22)\namusement 1.40% .33 (.12,.53)\nrelief 1.38% -.51 (-.65, -.37)\ncuriosity 1.34% .14 (-.08,.35)\nlove 1.14% .39 (.20,.55)\nTABLE 4 Alliance prediction: emotions, relative SHAP value, and\ncorrelation with SHAP value.\nEmotion Alliance\nRelative\nSHAP value\nCorrelation with SHAP\nvalue (95%-CI)\ncuriosity 24.94% -.96 (-1.00, -.92)\nconfusion 16.41% -.93 (-1.00, -.85)\nsurprise 5.42% .77 (.55,.95)\ndesire 4.72% .84 (.65,.98)\njoy 4.69% .61 (.35,.85)\nadmiration 4.61% .56 (.30,.81)\nexcitement 4.35% .77 (.49,.98)\nrealization 4.02% .65 (.36,.90)\nanger 3.85% -.37 (-.69, -.04)\ndisapproval 3.36% -.35 (-.65, -.05)\namusement 3.02% .62 (.35,.86)\nannoyance 2.08% .49 (.22,.78)\nremorse 1.94% .50 (.15,.80)\napproval 1.62% -.23 (-.46, -.05)\nrelief 1.57% .48 (.20,.77)\noptimism 1.43% .05 (-.11,.28)\nfear 1.40% -.31 (-.55, -.08)\ndisappointment 1.34% -.53 (-.77, -.25)\ngrief 1.08% -.06 (-.31,.25)\nneutral 1.08% .16 (.01,.37)\nlove 1.07% .44 (.15,.73)\ndisgust 1.06% .40 (.15,.66)\nnervousness 1.02% .01 (-.21,.25)\ncaring 0.91% .53 (.26,.80)\ngratitude 0.88% .06 (-.13,.30)\nsadness 0.88% .31 (.07,.61)\npride 0.82% .07 (-.13,.31)\nembarrassment 0.42% .12 (-.03,.33)\nLalk et al. 10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1504306\nFrontiers inPsychiatry frontiersin.org09\nLimitations and future directions\nThis analysis comes with several limitations. Regarding our\ntranscript-based approach, the training data is not optimal, as it is\nbased on a social media dataset containing comments with a length\nof only 3 to 30 words. As can be seen fromTable 2, the social media\ncomments tended to be more informal and contained some slang.\nAlso, the comments seemed more expressive and more intense,\nwhich could cause problems with the emotion detection. It would\ntherefore be desirable to train models on labeled data from the\nrelevant domain (i.e., therapy transcripts), incorporating longer and\nmore complex statements, because domain speciﬁcity can improve\nmodel accuracy (56, 97). Also, it would be desirable to have training\nset, which is better balanced across emotions, because some\nemotions (e.g., grief, pride, relief, nervousness, embarrassment; see\nFigure 1) hardly occur in the training data. This could lead the\nmodel to be biased against these emotions so that they may not be\ndetected. In general, emotion detection could be improved by\nincluding other modalities, such as voice (92) or mimic via video\n(93) due to the superiority of a multimodal approach ( 98).\nAltogether, these approach es would likely improve the\nclassiﬁcation accuracy substantially.\nSince some of the emotions (e.g.,realization, approval) were\nonly loosely connected to the psychological concept of emotions (2),\nfuture analyses could beneﬁt from a clearer and more distinct\ndeﬁnition of the included emotions. Further, clearly, the\nrelationship between patient emotions and alliance is more\ncomplex than assumed in our hypotheses. On the one hand, it\nhas been suggested that the effects of emotional arousal on outcome\ncan be moderated by the alliance so that high arousal can be\nproductive as long as there is a sufﬁciently strong alliance (8). On\nthe other hand, the therapist may actively manage the alliance so\nthat it may be soothing in the context of high arousal and activating\nand challenging in the context of (too) little arousal (8). Therefore,\nNLP could be incorporated to model the alliance over the course of\na session to assess the dynamic interplay between emotions and\nalliance. This could be employed to give feedback to therapists after\na session, highlighting moments where they could modulate the\ninteraction to increase or decrease arousal. Another approach\nwould be the integration of the rapist emotions and therapist\nempathy into our model to assess which therapist emotions may\nbe detrimental to the alliance.\nConclusion\nIn summary, our transcript-based model could classify 28\nemotions with reasonable model-rater-agreement ( F1 =. 4 5 ,\nKappa = .42). Classi ﬁcation tended to be more reliable for\npositive emotions. The average d etection probability ranged\nbetween 13% (approval) and 0.1% (grief). Substantial associations\nwith symptom severity ( r = .50) were found in the expected\ndirections (i.e., positive emot ions were associated with lower\nsymptom severity and negative emotions with higher symptom\nseverity) by selecting SVR and RF learners. Associations with\nalliance (r = .20) were lower and the selected learners were Lasso,\nElastic Net, and RF. While many positive emotions predicted higher\nalliance, the results for negative emotions were mixed. Notably,\nnegative emotions that could serve as withdrawal (confusion; 16%\nimpact) or confrontation ruptures (anger, disapproval;together 7%\nimpact) predicted lower alliance. In the future, this model opens a\nwide array of possibilities regarding process-outcome associations\nwith emotional processes, such as analyzing the emotion dynamic\nover the course of a session or comparing patient with\ntherapist emotions.\nData availability statement\nThe original contributions presented in the study are publicly\navailable.
