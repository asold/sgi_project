Statistics allows summarizing and interpreting a huge \nset of information based on parameters such as mean and variance, making \nthem applicable to any scientific area. Genetics and breeding present several \nparticularities, which require the knowledge of biometrics and quantitative \ngenetics in order to assist the decision-making process with less error as possible, \nand consequently maximizes the gain with selection of certain materials, without \nexhausting the available genetic variability.\nThus, integrating the knowledge on statistics and on biometric models \napplicable to genetics and breeding is necessary. Only a few software packages \nmake this information available to the user, and allow simple and quick decision-\nmaking with the correct interpretation of results. Therefore, for genetics and \nbreeding, obtaining additional genetic parameters is fundamental, such as \nheritability, intraclass correlation, genotypic variance, among other parameter \nthat are not estimated by most statistical software. In this way, Rbio provides all \nthis information to assist the correct decision-making by the breeder, without \nrequiring the knowledge on the programming in R language.\n The Rbio software output files are easy to use, since they present all the \nsignificances of the statistical tests, and indicate how to interpret the values. In \naddition, mean tests already show all letters indicating the differences between \nthe means, which makes the Rbio an excellent software for users who have just \nstarted working with data analysis. The software is also useful for users who \n188\nCrop Breeding and Applied Biotechnology - 17: 187-190, 2017\nLL Bhering\nalready have good knowledge on statistics and biometrics, but do not have time to program in the R. Thus, the breeder \ncan use the scripts available in Rbio by running the analyses in a quick and efficient way.\nDESCRIPTION\nThe software Rbio is compatible with IBM PCs and requires the Windows operating system. The user must have the \nR software (R Development Core Team 2011) installed in the computer, which can be downloaded for free from the \nInternet (https://www.r-project.org/).\nCurrently, Rbio is available in Portuguese, with 19 sample files on how the data should be arranged in the file to \nbe analyzed, and is easy to be downloaded due to its small size (2MB). The software installation is simple: after the \ndownload, the user needs to unzip the folder, click on the “setup” and follow the instructions, and install the _Rbio file \nin the C: drive of the computer.\nAVAILABLE PROCEDURES\nRbio has several procedures for data processing. In the main screen, the user will find the following items in the menu:\nBasic statistics\nInitial step of analysis, used to describe, organize and summarize the collected data. In this menu, basic analyses \ncan be performed:\na. Descriptive statistics of data (mean, standard deviation, mean standard error, variance, coefficient of variation, and \nscatter plots). All these measures are extremely important for data analysis, since they allow verifying the potential of the \nbreeding material, and the presence of typing errors, by means of the maximum and minimum values for each variable.\nb. Correlation. This procedure allows the simultaneous analysis of the association between variables by calculating \nthe Pearson correlation between all pairs of variables and their significance test.\nc. Regressions: simple linear, multiple and polynomial, response surface with 3D graphic, and Probit analysis. These \nprocedures allow the identification of the behavior of a main dependent variable with one or more explanatory variables. \nIn addition, the user can construct regression models for variables with different types of transformation.\nd. Normality test: One of the assumptions of the analysis of variance is that the data have normal distribution. This \nprocedure performs the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilks tests to determine whether the data of a certain variable \ncomes from a normal distribution. Multivariate normality test can also be carried out.\ne. Simulation: Allows the sampling in the field in completely randomized design, randomized blocks, Latin Square, \nin addition to experimental arrangements in single and triple factorial, 2x2 and 3x3 lattices, and m augmented blocks. \nIn this item, experiments in randomized block with the mean and variance of interest can also be performed.\nf. Data transformation: This procedure evaluates the assumptions of the analysis of variance for variables and some \ntransformations, in order to assist the user in identifying the need for transformation, and which transformation would \nbe more suitable.\nAnalysis of Variance (ANOVA)\nIn this procedure, analyses of variances of the different experimental designs and arrangements can be carried out, \nsuch as: completely randomized, randomized blocks, factorial (AxB, AxBxC, AxBxCxD), simple and triple lattice, hierarchical, \nsplit-plot, and split-split plot, Latin square and augmented blocks. In addition, within each of the procedures, normality \ntest (Shapiro-Wilk) and test for homogeneity of variances (Bartlett) can be carried out, with the option of showing or not \nthe genetic parameters of the experiments. In addition, the F-test for each variation source is correctly displayed, after \ncorrection, when necessary, in case of random and mixed models. When the option “estimate genetic parameters” is \nchecked, the parameters genetic variance, residual variance, block variance, variance of the GxE interaction, heritability, \nintraclass correlation, and coefficient of genetic variation are calculated.\nRbio: A tool for biometric and statistical analysis using the R platform\n189\nCrop Breeding and Applied Biotechnology - 17: 187-190, 2017\nFor the aforementioned models, the following means tests can be processed: Tukey (Tukey 1953), SNK (Student 1927, \nNewman 1939, Keuls 1952), Scheffe (Scheffé 1959), Duncan (Duncan 1955), Dunnet (Dunnet 1955). The Scott-Knott  \nclustering can also be performed (Scott and Knott 1974).\nIn this module, analysis of variance from unbalanced data can be performed in several experimental designs and \narrangements. There is also the possibility of using the analysis via mixed models and analyses with qualitative and \nquantitative factors at the same time by performing the ANOVA of the data and mean test for the qualitative factors; \nand regression for the quantitative factors.\nMultivariate statistics\nMultivariate analyses use of all variables evaluated in the experiment, unlike ANOVA, which is univariate and analyzes \neach variable at once. Measures of distance and clustering of genetic material, principal component analysis, factor \nanalysis, multivariate analysis of variance (Manova), canonical correlations and discriminant analysis are available to \nthe user.\nNon-parametric statistics\nThe non-parametric statistical module addresses variables without normal distribution. Friedman, Kruskall-Wallis, \nand Wilcoxon tests are available for this type of analysis for one or several samples, paired or not, besides the Spearman \nand Kendall correlation. \nBiometrics\nThe biometrics module has one of the most widely used adaptability and stability methods in the world to investigate \ngenotype x environment interactions, the Additive Main effects and Multiplicative Interaction - AMMI (Gauch 1988), \nwhich enables graphical projection of experiments carried out in different environments (years and/or sites).\nOther possibilities for the research of genotypes x environment interaction are available, such as methodologies of \nenvironmental stratification and analysis of stability and adaptability.\nMulticollinearity diagnosis of the variables under study, path analysis and canonical correlations can be carried out. \nEstimates of direct and indirect selection gains between variables can be obtained.  Selection index methodologies for \ngain with several variables at the same time are also available.\nThe software also allows diallel analyses, which are useful at the early stages of the breeding program for parent \nidentification.\nIn addition, matrices of phenotypic, genotypic and environmental correlations and partial correlation analyses can \nbe obtained.\nIn the biometrics module, genomic selection analyses in several methods, such as rrBLUP , Bayesian lasso, and others \nare also available. In addition, molecular markers can be identified and selected.\nBioinformatics\nThis procedure allows reading DNA data in .fasta format. DNA sequence statistics, such as length, composition of \nbases, variation of GC content, among others, are available in the software, as well as graphs with these statistics.\nTeaching\nThis module contains the procedures “Mean degree of dominance” and “Analysis of generations”, which allow \nprofessors and students of Basic Genetics, Populations Genetics, and Quantitative Genetics to obtain genetic parameters, \nsuch as allele frequency, mean and genotypic variance in function of the number of individuals.\nUSING THE PROGRAM\nThe user is given a set of data to be used as an example on how the data should be arranged in Rbio. In this way, \n190\nCrop Breeding and Applied Biotechnology - 17: 187-190, 2017\nLL Bhering\nthe user can see the example and arrange the data file according to the analysis to be performed. The only information \nrequired is whether the first line of the file to be analyzed presents information such as the name of the variables, or \nit constitutes the data set itself.\nAfter selecting the input file, the program will name an output file in .txt format, with the same name of the input \nfile, followed by the word “output”. This file will be allocated in the same folder as the input file, making it easier for \nthe user to keep the data together. Several procedures have some graphic files saved in .pdf.\nSome procedures require additional R packages. If the user does not have them installed in the computer, there \nwill be the “install package” button; by clicking on this button, Rbio will proceed with the correct installation. Once \nit has been completed, the user will click on “process”, so that all analyses are performed. Alternatively, the user can \ngo to the “Tools” menu, option “R: install packages”, and download all packages necessary to perform the procedures \navailable on Rbio.\nThe user can access the scripts used in the analyses after the processing by enabling the option “see script”, which \nwill allow saving or changing the script used. This saved file can be directly used in the R software, or in the option \n“Tools - run R scripts” available in Rbio. This makes Rbio a unique software, since it assists the the understanding of \nprogramming in R language.\nCONCLUSION\nRbio is a software composed of several routines to be processed in the R software. However, it does not require the \nknowledge on the programming in R language. It has great diversity of procedures for analysis and processing of different \ngenetic-statistical models applicable mainly to plant breeding. It is free and easy to use, and is suitable for universities \nand public and private companies, since it assists in the decision-making inherent to all statistical experiments.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe author gratefully acknowledges FAPEMIG, CAPES and CNPq for their financial support.\nREFERENCES\nDuncan DB (1955) Multiple range and multiple F tests.
