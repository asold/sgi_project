  "abstract": "Abstract Data extraction is a crucial, yet labor-intensive and error-prone part of evidence synthesis. To date, efforts to harness machine learning for enhancing efficiency of the data extraction process have fallen short of achieving sufficient accuracy and usability. With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), new possibilities have emerged to increase efficiency and accuracy of data extraction for evidence synthesis. The objective of this proof-of-concept study was to assess the performance of an LLM (Claude 2) in extracting data elements from published studies, compared with human data extraction as employed in systematic reviews. Our analysis utilized a convenience sample of 10 English-language, open-access publications of randomized controlled trials included in a single systematic review. We selected 16 distinct types of data, posing varying degrees of difficulty (160 data elements across 10 studies). We used the browser version of Claude 2 to upload the portable document format of each publication and then prompted the model for each data element. Across 160 data elements, Claude 2 demonstrated an overall accuracy of 96.3% with a high test-retest reliability (replication 1: 96.9%; replication 2: 95.0% accuracy). Overall, Claude 2 made 6 errors on 160 data items. The most common errors (n=4) were missed data items. Importantly, Claude 2’s ease of use was high; it required no technical expertise or training data for effective operation. Based on findings of our proof-of-concept study, leveraging LLMs has the potential to substantially enhance the efficiency and accuracy of data extraction for evidence syntheses.",

Fi rst, we notice d th at i n  \nseveral cases Claude 2 was able to infer  information no t expl icitly repo rt ed in t he articl e. Fo r ex ample ,  \nour promp t rel ate d to the s ex of pa rtici pants specifically requ est ed th e perc ent female; in some s tudie s  \nClaude infer red  this resul t bas ed o n t he number of  males enroll ed and the  to tal number of  par ticipants ,  \nwhich is something that  our h uman e xt r actors would  have also  had to h ave don e to have r epor ted  th e  \nnumber and perc ent of females enroll ed. Ano ther exampl e was the prompt  relate d to number o f  \nparticipan ts analyzed . I n many, but not  all cases,  Claude  2 cor rectly inf err ed t he  number  of pa rticipan ts  \nanalyzed b ased on  th e numbe r of par tici pants r andomized . I n one  case, the  refe r ence st andard  rep ort ed  \nthe medi an age  or m edian du ra tion of d isease; i n resp onse to ou r pr ompts for t he mean age an d mea n  \nduratio n of disease, Claud e 2 correctly  told us that the mea n was not rep or ted but offer ed us th e  \nmedian, minimum,  and  maximum,  which is th e sam e infe rence  our  human  e xtr actors had ma de rela tiv e  \nto th e source PDF.  Lastly, we obs erved that in comp arison t o our hum an ex trac ted r eferenc e stand ar d  \ndata, Claud e 2 provided more compl e te and consist ent r esponses , for exam ple providing baselin e  \ncharacte ristics by group and overall, consisten tly rounding to the same deci mal place, standar dize d  \nformatting of the ex trac ted da ta, and in cluding accent marks on author names where rel evant. W e did  \nnot consid er thes e typ es of issues as e rr ors in ou r human-ex tract ed refer ence s t andard but rat her  ar eas  \nwhere Claude-2 add ed value to the e xt ra ction process .  \nDiscussion \nOur pr oof-of-concept stu dy demonst rat e s the p romising pot enti al of leve raging LLMs, par ticularly Claud e  \n2, for semi-au tomat ed d ata  ex trac tion f or evidenc e synth eses.  Claude 2  exh ibit ed an imp ressive 96 .3%  \naccuracy in ex tracti ng data from pu blica tions of our sel ect ed studi es. The test-r e test reliabili ty of Claude  \n2 across three r ounds of data ex tr action was also high, although erro rs largely occurred in differen t dat a  \nitems during replica tions th an in the ini t ial data e xt raction . This indicates t hat th e inhere nt stoch asticity  \nof LLMs has a minimal impact on the ove rall dat a ex trac tion pe rformance bu t play s a role for which items  \nerro rs occur.
