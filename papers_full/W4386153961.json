    "abstract": "Conversational large language model (LLM)-based chatbots utilize neural networks to process natural language. By generating highly sophisticated outputs from contextual input text, they revolutionize the access to further learning, leading to the development of new skills and personalized interactions. Although they are not developed to provide healthcare, their potential to address biomedical issues is rather unexplored. Healthcare digitalization and documentation of electronic health records is now developing into a standard practice. Developing tools to facilitate clinical review of unstructured data such as LLMs can derive clinical meaningful insights for ovarian cancer, a heterogeneous but devastating disease. Compared to standard approaches, they can host capacity to condense results and optimize analysis time. To help accelerate research in biomedical language processing and improve the validity of scientific writing, task-specific and domain-specific language models may be required. In turn, we propose a bespoke, proprietary ovarian cancer-specific natural language using solely in-domain text, whereas transfer learning drifts away from the pretrained language models to fine-tune task-specific models for all possible downstream applications. This venture will be fueled by the abundance of unstructured text information in the electronic health records resulting in ovarian cancer research ultimately reaching its linguistic home.",
