  "abstract": "This study investigates the adaptability of Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents in the Metaverse, focusing on their ability to enhance responsiveness, decision-making, and engagement through the proposed Adaptive Learning Model for AI Agents (ALMAA) framework. The research does not introduce new interventions to existing platforms like Epic Games or AltspaceVR but instead analyzes how their operations align with adaptive learning principles. By examining these platforms, the study demonstrates the alignment between real-world practices and theoretical constructs, offering insights into how adaptive AI systems operate in dynamic virtual environments. Case observations highlight key metrics such as user interaction efficiency, contextual decision accuracy, and predictive engagement strategies. The data, derived from detailed user interaction logs and feedback reports, underscore the practical application of adaptive learning in optimizing user satisfaction and system performance. Statistical analyses reveal notable gains in response speed, predictive precision, and user engagement, validating the theoretical framework’s relevance. This paper positions the ALMAA framework as a critical lens for understanding and analyzing adaptive AI in virtual settings. It emphasizes theoretical exploration rather than experimental application, providing a foundation for future research into scalable, user-centered AI systems tailored for the Metaverse’s evolving demands.",
