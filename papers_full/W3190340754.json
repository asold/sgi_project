ACM,\nNew York, NY, USA, 10 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/3474085.3475601\n1 INTRODUCTION\nSalient object detection (SOD) simulates the visual attention mech-\nanism to capture the prominent object in the scene. It has been\nwidely applied in the computer vision tasks, such as image segmen-\ntation [18], tracking [30, 47, 83], retrieval [25], compression [32],\nedit [65] and quality assessment [34].\nAs a pixel-level dense prediction task, salient object detection\nusually uses CNN based U-Net framework[58] (Fig. 1(a)) to encode\nimages from low-level to high-level, and then decode back to the\nfull spatial resolution. Research[74] points out that the performance\ntends to saturate quickly when gradually aggregating features from\nhigh-level to low-level. In other words, high-level features con-\ntribute more to the performance. Therefore, we propose a triplet\ntransformer embedding module (TTEM) to enhance the feature\nrepresentation of high three layers.\nAs we all known, Transformer[62] has recently attracted a lot\nof attention in computer vision domain, but it is also encounter-\ning high computational cost problem. PVT[ 66] adopts a spatial-\nreduction attention (SRA) layer to reduce the resource cost to learn\nhigh-resolution feature maps. CvT[72] introduces convolutional\ninto the Vision Transformer architecture to concurrently main-\ntain a high degree of computational and memory efficiency. Swin\nTransformer[44] uses the shifted windows calculation method to\npropose a hierarchical Transformer, which has the flexibility of\nmodelling at various scales and has linear computational complex-\nity relative to the image size. Multi-Scale Vision Longformer[82]\nproposes multi-scale coding structure, and further improves its\nattention mechanism to reduce the computational and memory\ncost.\nUnlike these profound designs, we introduce Transformer into\nU-Net framework to enhance the features of high three layers,\nwhich can be easily integrated into existing U-Net framework for\nsignificant improvement with less cost. The features of high three\narXiv:2108.03990v1  [cs.CV]  9 Aug 2021\nlayers show the different attributions but the same in nature, which\nare the different aspects of the same input image. The proposed\ntriplet transformer embedding module (TTEM) is composed of\nthree standard transformer encoders[62] with shared weights. It\nis beneficial to find the common information which is hidden in\nthe multi-level features and achieve the better fusion by learning\nlong-range dependencies across levels.\n(a) U-Net framework\n(b) visual-transformer-FPN (VT-FPN)\n(c) Our proposed triplet transformer embedding network\nFigure 1: Comparison between U-Net framework, VT-FPN\nand our proposed network.\nTaking TTME as the core, we further propose the triplet trans-\nformer embedding network (TriTransNet). At first, multi-level fea-\ntures are adjusted to the same size by a transition layer and pro-\ngressively upsampling fusion module. Second, features are fed into\nTTME to be enhanced. Last, the output features of TTME and the\nfeatures of low two layers are effectively fused by a three-stream\ndecoder.\nOur proposed TriTransNet is the first attempt to use three stan-\ndard transformer encoders with shared weights to enhance the\nfeature representation. Different from visual-transformer-FPN (VT-\nFPN)[71] in Fig. 1(b) which merges visual tokens from feature map\nof each layer with one transformer, our TriTransNet in Fig. 1(c)\nadopts weight sharing strategy to make visual tokens extracted\nfrom multi-level features more abundant enough to express the\noriginal information, and meanwhile high-layer semantic informa-\ntion and middle-layer texture or shape information are both better\nexcavated by parallel self-attention mechanism.\nIn addition, depth information is proved to supply the useful\ncues and boost the performance for saliency detection [ 51], es-\npecially in some challenging and complex scenarios, e.g. the low\ncolor contrasts between salient objects and background, the clut-\ntered background interferences. But depth image with poor quality,\nwhich likes a noise, brings some negative influences [22]. Following\ndepth guided manners [11, 12, 23, 52, 57, 60, 79, 89, 93] we design\ndepth purification module, which uses depth information to purify\nthe color features.\nOur main contributions can be summarized as follows:\n•A triplet transformer embedding module is proposed and\nembedded into CNN based U-Net framework to enhance the\nfeature representation. It is composed of three standard trans-\nformer encoders with shared weights, learning the common\ninformation from multi-level features.\n•Based on the proposed triplet transformer embedding mod-\nule, triplet transformer embedding network is designed to\ndetect the salient objects in RGB-D image. Multi-level fea-\ntures from encoder need to be adjusted to the same size by a\ntransition layer and progressively upsampling fusion mod-\nule, and then fed into triplet transformer embedding module.\nThen the output of triplet transformer embedding module\nneed to be combined with the features of low two layers by\nthree-stream decoder to achieve the decoding process.\n•Depth image is viewed as the supplement to color feature,\nand attached to color feature to enhance the feature repre-\nsentation by depth purification module which introduces\nspatial attention and channel attention.\n•Due to the advantage of the proposed triplet transformer\nembedding module, the proposed model pushes the perfor-\nmance of RGB-D salient object detection to a new level and\nshows the state-of-the-art performance on several public\ndatasets.\n2 RELATED WORK\n2.1 RGB-D saliency detection\nIn RGB-D image, color image provides appearance and texture infor-\nmation, and depth image contains 3D layout and spatial structure.\nThe fusion of color feature and depth feature is always an important\nissue in RGB-D saliency detection. References[10, 45, 85, 90] use\nearly fusion or input fusion, references[ 7, 11, 38, 39, 41] employ\ntwo-stream subnetwork to achieve the middle fusion, references[53,\n57, 73, 89, 93] apply depth guided fusion and references [14, 46, 64]\nadopt late fusion.\nAlthough depth information can supply the useful cues for\nsaliency detection [51], depth image with poor quality can bring\nsome negative influences too [ 22]. In order to solve the filtering\nissue of low-quality depth map, D3Net [22] uses gate mechanism to\nfilter the poor depth map, EF-Net [9] enhances the depth maps by\ncolor hint map, DQSD [5] integrates a depth quality aware subnet-\nwork into the classic bi-stream structure, assigning the weight of\ndepth feature before conducting the fusion. In addition, CoNet[33],\nDASNet [88], SSDP[68] and MobileSal [73] introduce depth estima-\ntion, learning to detect the salient object simultaneously.\nIn the paper, we adopt depth guided manner. Depth information\nis viewed as the supplement to the color feature. It enhances the\ncolor feature by attention mechanism.\n2.2 Transformer\nTransformer is first proposed by[ 62] to replace recurrent neural\nnetworks (RNN), e.g.long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated\nrecurrent unit(GRU) for machine translation tasks. It can over-\ncome intrinsic shortages of RNN and has dominated nature lan-\nguage processing (NLP) field and are becoming increasingly pop-\nular in computer vision tasks, e.g. image classification[19], object\ndetection[4], semantic segmentation[? ], line segment[77], person\nre-identification[94], action detection[87], image completion[91],\n3D point cloud processing[26, 86], pose estimation[59], facial ex-\npression recognition[48], object tracking[49] etc. DETR[4] takes\nthe lead in applying Transformer to the field of object detection\nand achieves the better performance. The successful use of ViT[19]\nin image classification tasks has made the research on visual Trans-\nformer a hot topics. SETR[92] deploys a pure Transformer as the\nencoder, combined with a simple decoder, to achieve a powerful\nsemantic segmentation model. Besides, TransUNet[8] uses the pre-\ntrained ViT[19] as a powerful backbone of the U-Net[58] network\nstructure, and performs well in the field of medical image segmen-\ntation.\nHowever, pure transformer has great limitations. As a result,\nmany improved visual transformers have emerged. The Conditional\nPosition encodings Visual Transformer (CPVT)[ 17] replaces the\nfixed position encoding in ViT[19] with the proposed conditional\nposition encoding (CPE), which makes it possible for Transformer to\nprocess inputs of arbitrary sizes. Tokens-to-Token (T2T)[78] adopts\na novel progressive tetanization mechanism, which models local\nstructural information by aggregating adjacent tokens into one\ntoken, while reducing the length of the token. LocalViT[42] adds lo-\ncality to vision transformers by introducing depth-wise convolution\ninto the feed-forward network, improving a locality mechanism\nfor information exchange within a local region. Considering that\nmost visual Transformers ignore the inherent structural informa-\ntion inside the sequence of patches, Transformer-iN-Transformer\n(TNT)[27] proposes to use outer Transformer block and inner Trans-\nformer block to model patch-level and pixel-level representations,\nrespectively. Co-Scale Conv-Attentional Image Transformers[76]\ndesigns a conv-attention module to realize relative position embed-\nding and enhance computation efficiency, and further proposes a\nco-scale mechanism to introduce cross-scale attention to enrich\nmulti-scale feature.\nOn the other hand, CNN has the advantages of extracting low\nlevel features and strengthening locality, while Transformer has\nthe advantages in establishing long-range dependencies. Some re-\nsearch makes full use of both advantages. TransFuse[ 84] uses a\ndual-branch structure, which uses Transformer to capture global\ndependencies, while low-level spatial details are extracted by CNN\nbranches. Similarly, CoTr[75] uses the CNN backbone to extract fea-\nture representations and proposes to use deformable Transformer\n(DeTrans) to model long-range dependencies, effectively bridging\nthe convolutional neural network and Transformer. ICT[63] uses\ntransformer to recover pluralistic coherent structures together with\nsome coarse textures, and uses CNN to enhances local texture de-\ntails of coarse priors, so as to achieve excellent results on the image\ncompletion task. TransT[13] uses Siamese-based CNN network for\nfeature extraction, and designs the self-attention-based ego-context\naugment (ECA) and cross-attention-based cross-feature augment\n(CFA) modules for feature fusion. Compact Transformers[28] elim-\ninates the requirement for class token and position embedding\nthrough a novel sequence pooling strategy and the use of convolu-\ntions, so as to perform head-to-head with state-of-the-art CNNs on\nsmall datasets.\nFollow this strategy, we present triplet transformer embedding\nmodule which is embedded into a U-Net framework to improve\nthe performance of RGB-D saliency detection. Combining both\nadvantages, our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance.\n3 PROPOSED METHOD\n3.1 Overview\nThe overall framework of the proposed triplet transformer embed-\nding network is depicted in Fig.2(a), which consists of multi-modal\nfusion encoder, feature enhancement module and three-stream de-\ncoder. The details can be seen in the following sections.\n3.2 Multi-modal fusion encoder\nColor and depth image in RGB-D image are two expressions for\ndifferent modalities of the same scene. Color image provides ap-\npearance cue and depth image shows three dimension spatial in-\nformation. Due to existence of poor quality depth map induced by\nthe imaging devices or conditions, we propose multi-modal fusion\nencoder, in which depth features are first purified by multi-modal\nfeatures using attention mechanism, and then served as supple-\nment to the color feature by the residual connection[29]. Residual\npart is designed as depth purification module (DPM), and shortcut\nconnection part is used to preserve more original color information.\nIn DPM which is shown in Fig. 2(b), depth feature is concatenated\nwith color feature, and fed into a channel attention module to get\nattentive channel mask, which is used to purify the depth feature in\na channel manner. Next, purified depth feature is fed into a spatial\nattention module again to generate attentive spatial mask, which is\nused to purify the depth feature in a spatial manner. The process\ncan be described as:\n𝐹𝑟\n𝑖 = 𝑓𝑑\n𝑖 ×𝑆𝐴(𝑓𝑑\n𝑖 ×𝐶𝐴(𝐶𝑎𝑡(𝑓𝑑\n𝑖 ,𝑓 𝑟\n𝑖 )))+ 𝑓𝑟\n𝑖 (1)\nwhere 𝑓𝑟\n𝑖 and 𝑓𝑑\n𝑖 represent color and depth features extracted by\nbackbone network respectively in which 𝑖 = 1,··· ,5, 𝐶𝑎𝑡(·)de-\nnotes concatenation and following convolution operation, 𝐶𝐴(·)\nand 𝑆𝐴(·)are channel and spatial attention operation which is pro-\nposed by CBAM[70], “×\" is element-wise multiplication operation,\n“+\" is element-wise addition operation.\nThus, the depth feature with poor quality can be purified, and\nthen attached to color feature to generate more accuracy feature\nrepresentation 𝐹𝑟\n𝑖 (𝑖 = 1,··· ,5).\n3.3 Feature enhancement module\nIn this module, we first adjust the features of high three layers\nto the same size, and then use the triplet transformer embedding\nFigure 2: Our proposed triplet transformer embedding network for RGB-D salient object detection.\nmodule to enhance the feature representation by learning long-\nrange dependency across levels, and last concatenate the input and\noutput of triplet transformer embedding module to preserve more\noriginal information.\n3.3.1 Scale adjustment module. The triplet transformer embedding\nmodule is composed of three standard transformer encoders with\nshared weights. Its input should be the features with the same size.\nBut the sizes of the multi-level features𝐹𝑟\n𝑖 from multi-modal fusion\nencoder are the different. Therefore, the first important task is to\nadjust the sizes of multi-level features.\nAt first, a transition layer which contains a 3 ×3 convolution\nand a ReLU activation function is applied on 𝐹𝑟\n𝑖 . It can adjust the\nnumber of channels of multi-level features to the same size. It can\nbe described as:\n𝐹′𝑟\n𝑖 = 𝜎(𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑣(𝐹𝑟\n𝑖 )) 𝑖 = 3,··· ,5 (2)\nwhere 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑣(·)is 3×3 convolution operation, and 𝜎(·)is ReLU acti-\nvation function.\nThen, we design a progressively upsampling fusion module\nwhich is used to adjust the resolution of the features in the high\nthree layers to the same size. Since the direct upsampling with 2×\nor 4×ratio will bring some noises, the features are progressively\nupsampled and fused. The fusion process can be described as:\n𝐹5 = 𝑈𝐹𝑀 (𝑈𝐹𝑀 (𝐹′𝑟\n5 ,𝐹 ′𝑟\n4 ),𝐹 ′𝑟\n3 )\n𝐹4 = 𝑈𝐹𝑀 (𝐹′𝑟\n4 ,𝐹 ′𝑟\n3 )\n𝐹3 = 𝐹′𝑟\n3\n(3)\nwhere 𝑈𝐹𝑀 (·)is shown in Fig.2(d). The detail can be described as:\n𝑈𝐹𝑀 (𝐹ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ,𝐹𝑙𝑜𝑤)= 𝐶𝑎𝑡(𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑣(𝑈𝑝(𝐹ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ)),𝐹𝑙𝑜𝑤) (4)\nwhere 𝐹ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ and 𝐹𝑙𝑜𝑤 denote the feature from the higher layer\nwith low resolution and the feature from the lower layer with\nhigh resolution, respectively, and 𝑈𝑝(·)denotes 2×upsampling\noperation.\nCompared with direct 2×, 4×upsampling on 𝐹′𝑟\n4 and 𝐹′𝑟\n5 , progres-\nsively upsampling fusion module can not only adjust the features\nto the same resolution but also increase the spatial detail of feature\nin the high layer by progressive fusion process.\nThus, the features 𝐹𝑖(𝑖 = 3,··· ,5)with the same scales will be\nserved as the input and fed into next triplet transformer embedding\nmodule.\n3.3.2 Triplet Transformer Embedding Module (TTEM). The fea-\ntures are first converted into the sequences of feature embedding,\nand then fed to three standard transformer encoders with shared\nweights to model the long-range relationship among different levels,\nand last reshaped to the original size of features.\nSpecifically, each input feature𝐹𝑖(𝑖 = 3,··· ,5)are first flattened\ninto a 1D sequence {𝐹𝑝\n𝑖 |𝑝 = 1,··· ,𝑁 }, where 𝑁 is the number of\npatches. Each patch 𝐹𝑝\n𝑖 is then mapped into a latent 𝐷-dimensional\nembedding space by a trainable linear projection layer. Furthermore,\nwe learn specific position embedding which are added to the patch\nembedding to retain positional information. The process can be\ndescribed as:\n𝑍0\n𝑖 = [𝐹1\n𝑖 +𝑃𝐸1; 𝐹2\n𝑖 +𝑃𝐸2; ··· ,; 𝐹𝑁\n𝑖 +𝑃𝐸𝑁] (5)\nwhere 𝑃𝐸 = {𝑃𝐸𝑝|𝑝 = 1,··· ,𝑁 }is a 1D learnable positional em-\nbedding.\nThe remaining architecture essentially follows the standard\ntransformer encoder[62] which stacks 𝐿 transformer layer. It is\nshown in Fig.2(c). Each transformer layer contains multi-headed\nself-attention (MSA) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) sublayer.\nLayer normalization (LN)[2] are inserted before these two sublayers,\nand the residual connection is performed after these two sublayers.\nThe process can be described as:\n \n\n𝑍𝑙\n𝑖\n′= 𝑀𝑆𝐴\n\u0010\n𝐿𝑁\n\u0010\n𝑍𝑙−1\n𝑖\n\u0011\u0011\n+𝑍𝑙−1\n𝑖\n𝑍𝑙\n𝑖 = 𝑀𝐿𝑃\n\u0010\n𝐿𝑁\n\u0010\n𝑍𝑙\n𝑖\n′\u0011\u0011\n+𝑍𝑙\n𝑖\n′ 𝑙 = 1,··· 𝐿 (6)\nwhere 𝐿denotes the number of transformer layers in the standard\ntransformer encoder.\n3.3.3 Feature concatenation module. The outputs of three weights\nshared transformer encoders 𝑍𝐿\n𝑖 (𝑖 = 3,··· ,5)fuses the informa-\ntion of three layers by Transformer mechanism, so as to enhance\nthe original feature representation. In order to preserve the more\noriginal information, we further cascade these outputs with original\nfeatures to generate the enhanced features of high three layers. The\nprocess can be described as:\n𝐹′\n𝑖 = 𝐶𝑎𝑡(𝑍𝐿\n𝑖 ,𝐹𝑖) 𝑖 = 3,··· 5 (7)\n3.4 Three-stream decoder\nAfter the features of high three layers are enhanced by the proposed\ntriplet transformer embedding module, we will combine them with\nthe features of low two layers to achieve the decoding process. There\nare two decoding methods. One is single-stream decoding and the\nother is three-stream decoding. The single-stream decoding first\nfuses three output results of feature enhancement module, and then\ncombine it with two features in the low layers. The three-stream\ndecoding first combines each output result of feature enhancement\nmodule with two features in the low layers, and then fuses three-\nstream results. We conduct two decoding processes, and find three-\nstream decoding is better than single-stream decoding. Next, we\nuse formula to show three-stream decoder as follow:\n𝐹′′\n𝑖 = 𝐶𝑎𝑡(𝐶𝑎𝑡(𝑈𝑝(𝐹′\n𝑖),𝐹2\n𝑟 ),𝐹1\n𝑟 ) 𝑖 = 3,··· 5 (8)\nThe above three features are performed upsampling, convolution\noperation and sigmoid function to generate the saliency maps𝑆𝑖(𝑖 =\n1,··· ,3)which are supervised by the ground truth maps.\n𝑆𝑖 = 𝑠𝑖𝑔(𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑣(𝑈𝑝(𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑣(𝑈𝑝(𝐹′′\n𝑖 ))))) (9)\nwhere 𝑠𝑖𝑔(·)denotes sigmoid function.\nAt last, we also fuse all the features above to generate the final\nsaliency map.\n𝑆𝑓𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑙 = 𝑠𝑖𝑔(\n5∑︁\n𝑖=3\n𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑣(𝑈𝑝(𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑣(𝑈𝑝(𝐹′′\n𝑖 ))))) (10)\nPixel position aware loss 𝐿𝑠𝑝𝑝𝑎 [69] is adopted for end-to-end\ntraining. The whole loss is defined as:\n𝐿= 𝐿𝑠\n𝑝𝑝𝑎(𝑆𝑓𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑙,𝐺)+\n5∑︁\n𝑖=3\n𝐿𝑠\n𝑝𝑝𝑎(𝑆𝑖,𝐺) (11)\nwhere 𝐺 is ground truth saliency map.\n4 EXPERIMENTS\n4.1 Datasets and evaluation metrics\n4.1.1 Datasets. We evaluate the proposed method on six challeng-\ning RGB-D SOD datasets. NLPR [ 54] includes 1000 images with\nsingle or multiple salient objects. NJU2K [36] consists of 2003 stereo\nimage pairs and ground-truth maps with different objects, com-\nplex and challenging scenes. STERE [50] incorporates 1000 pairs\nof binocular images downloaded from the Internet. DES [15] has\n135 indoor images collected by Microsoft Kinect. SIP [22] contains\n1000 high-resolution images of multiple salient persons. DUT [56]\ncontains 1200 images captured by Lytro camera in real life scenes.\nFor the sake of fair comparison, we use the same training dataset\nas in [11, 22], which consists of 1,485 images from the NJU2K dataset\nand 700 images from the NLPR dataset. The remaining images in the\nNJU2K and NLPR datasets and the whole datasets of STERE, DES\nand SIP are used for testing. In addition, on the DUT dataset, we\nfollow the same protocols as in [33, 39, 56, 57, 90] to add additional\n800 pairs from DUT for training and test on the remaining 400 pairs.\nIn summary, our training set contains 2,185 paired RGB and depth\nimages, but when testing is conducted on DUT, our training set\ncontains 2,985 paired ones.\n4.1.2 Evaluation Metrics. We adopt five widely used metrics to\nevaluate the performance of our model and other state-of-the-art\nRGB-D SOD models, including the precision-recal(PR) curve [ 3],\nE-measure [21], S-measure [20], F-measure [1] and mean absolute\nerror (MAE) [ 55]. Specifically, the PR curve plots precision and\nrecall values by setting a series of thresholds on the saliency maps to\nget the binary masks and further comparing them with the ground\ntruth maps. The E-measure simultaneously captures global statistics\nand local pixel matching information. The S-measure can evaluate\nboth region-aware and object-aware structural similarity between\nsaliency map and ground truth. The F-measure is the weighted\nharmonic mean of precision and recall, which can evaluate the\noverall performance. The MAE measures the average of the per-\npixel absolute difference between the saliency maps and the ground\ntruth maps. In our experiment, E-measure and F-measure adopts\nadaptive values.\n4.2 Implementation details\nDuring the training and testing phase, the input RGB and depth\nimages are resized to 256×256. Multiple enhancement strategies\nare used for all training images, i.e. random flipping, rotating and\nborder clipping. Parameters of the backbone network are initialized\nwith the pretrained parameters of ResNet-50 network [ 29]. The\nhyper-parameters in transformer encoder are set as: 𝐿 = 12,𝐷 =\n768,𝑁 = 1024. The rest of parameters are initialized to PyTorch\ndefault settings. We employ the Adam optimizer [37] to train our\nnetwork with a batch size of 3 and an initial learning rate 1e-5, and\nthe learning rate will be divided by 10 every 60 epochs. Our model\nis trained on a machine with a single NVIDIA GTX 3090 GPU. The\nmodel converges within 150 epochs, which takes nearly 15 hours.\n4.3 Comparisons with the state-of-the-art\nOur model is compared with 16 state-of-the-art RGB-D SOD models,\nincluding D3Net [22], ICNet [41], DCMF [6], DRLF [67], SSF [81],\nSSMA [43], A2dele [57], UCNet [80], CoNet [33], DANet [90], JLDCF[24],\nEBFSP[31],CDNet[35], HAINet[40], RD3D[10] and DSA2F[61]. To\nensure the fairness of the comparison results, the saliency maps of\nthe evaluation are provided by the authors or generated by running\nsource codes.\n4.3.1 Quantitative Evaluation. Figure.3 shows the comparison re-\nsults on PR curve. Table.1 shows the quantitative comparison results\nof four evaluation metrics. As can be clearly observed from figure\nthat our curves are very short, which means that our recall is very\nhigh. Furthermore, from the table, we can see that all the evalua-\ntion metrics are nearly the best on six datasets, so as to verify the\neffectiveness and advantages of our proposed method. Only two\nS-measure values in NLPR and STERE datasets are inferior to the\nbest, but they are also the second best. Combined with the results of\nfigure and table, our method achieves the impressive performance.\n4.3.2 Qualitative Evaluation. To make the qualitative comparisons,\nwe show some visual examples in Figure.4. It can be observed that\nour method has better detection results than other methods in\nsome challenging cases: similar foreground and background(1𝑠𝑡-\n2𝑛𝑑 rows), complex scene(3𝑟𝑑-4𝑡ℎ rows), low quality depth map(5𝑡ℎ-\n6𝑡ℎ rows), small object(7𝑡ℎ-8𝑡ℎ rows) and multiple objects(9𝑡ℎ-10𝑡ℎ\nrows). These indicate that our approach can better locate salient\nobjects and produce more accurate saliency maps. In addition, our\napproach can produce more fine-grained details as highlighted in\nthe salient region(11𝑡ℎ-12𝑡ℎ rows). This is also the proof of the\neffectiveness of our method.\n4.4 Ablation studies\nWe conduct ablation studies on NLPR, NJU2K, SIP and STERE\ndatasets to investigate the contributions of different modules in the\nproposed method.\n4.4.1 The effectiveness of triplet transformer embedding module\n(TTEM). The baseline model used here removes TTEM. Its perfor-\nmance is shown in the variant No.1 of Table. 2. Further, we replace\nTTEM with gated recurrent unit (GRU) [16], whose result is shown\nin the variant No.2 of Table. 2. The variant No.3 of Table. 2 is the\nresult of siamese transformer applied in the high two layers. The\nvariant No.4 of Table. 2 is the result of quadruplet transformer ap-\nplied in the high four layers. The variant No.5 of Table. 2 is our\nresult of triplet transformer applied in the high three layers.\nIt can be clearly observed that compared with No.1, the result of\nour TriTransNet is improved 0.016 in the S-measure metric, 0.021\nin the F-measure metric, 0.008 in the E-measure metric and 0.007\nin the MAE metric on average. Meanwhile, compared with No.2, the\nresult of our TriTransNet is improved0.012 in the S-measure metric,\n0.014 in the F-measure metric, 0.006 in the E-measure metric and\n0.005 in the MAE metric on average. TTEM plays an important\nrole in the performance improvement.\nIn addition, we compare No.3, No.4 and No.5 and find that Triplet\nwin Siamese in S-measure, F-measure, E-measure, and MAE about\n0.009,0.016,0.006 and 0.005 on average, and outperform Quadruplet\nabout 0.010,0.009,0.005 and 0.004 on average. Our TriTransNet en-\nhances long-range dependency of semantic information by using\nthe features in the high three layers, and further combines with\nthree-stream usampling decoding in the low two layers to perfectly\ndepict the detailed boundary, so as to achieve the best performance.\n4.4.2 The effectiveness of three-stream decoder. we further conduct\nthe ablation study by replacing three stream decoder with single-\nstream decoder to check the effectiveness of the designed three-\nstream decoder. Table. 3 No.1 denotes the model which adopts\nsingle-stream decoder and No.2 means our three-stream decoder.\nFrom Table. 3, we can see that the use of three-stream decoder\nobviously improves the detection performance. It benefits from the\nfull integration of multi-layer features.\n4.4.3 The effectiveness of depth purification module (DPM). The\nbaseline model used here removes depth purification module (DPM).\nIt attaches the depth feature to color feature by element-wise ad-\ndition operation in the encoder. Its performance is illustrated in\nthe variant No.1 of Table. 4. Further, we discuss the similar depth-\nenhanced module (DEM) proposed in BBS[ 23] whose result is\nshown in the variant No.2 of Table. 4. The variant No.3 of Table. 4\ndenotes the model which adopts DPM instead of element-wise\naddition operation based on the baseline.\nCompared with No.1, the performance of the variant No.3 is\nsignificantly improved. Meanwhile, compared with No.2 which\nusing DEM, our detection effect is also better than that of No.2. It\nverified that the effectiveness of DPM.\n5 CONCLUSIONS\nIn the paper, we introduce transformer into U-Net framework to\ndetect salient object in RGB-D image. Different from existing com-\nbination method of transformer and convolutional neural networks,\nwe propose a triplet transformer embedding module which can be\nembedded into existing U-Net models for the better feature rep-\nresentation by learning long-range dependency among different\nlevels with less cost. Furthermore, we use depth information to\nenhance RGB features by depth purification module. Experimental\nresults show our method pushes the performance to a new level,\n(a)NLPR dataset (b)NJU2K dataset (c)STERE dataset\n(d)DES dataset (e)SIP dataset (f)DUT dataset\nFigure 3: P-R curves comparisons of different models on six datasets.\nTable 1: S-measure, adaptive F-measure, adaptive E-measure, MAE comparisons with different models.
