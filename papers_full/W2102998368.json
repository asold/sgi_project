I NTRODUCTION\nC\nOPLANAR waveguide (CPW) bandpass ﬁlters with\nsize-compactness have been attracting a rapidly in-\ncreasing interest in the exploration of high-frequency integrated\ncircuits. In [1], a capacitively end-coupled CPW bandpass ﬁlter\nwas initially proposed by cutting gaps in the central conductor\nof CPW . T o circumvent the problem of high radiation loss\nhappened around the gaps, an alternative inductively end-cou-\npled bandpass ﬁlter was developed by electrically connecting\nthe inner and outer conductors together via metallic strip with\nnarrow widths [2]. It needs to be pointed out here that the two\nabove ﬁlter blocks are built up on a basis of half-wavelength\n(\n2) CPW resonators. In order to reduce the whole dimen-\nsion, the 4 CPW resonator is recently utilized in the ﬁlter\ndesign. In this way , its two ends are driven by series-capacitive\nand shunt-inductive coupling elements [3], [4], respectively ,\nthereby removing out the ﬁrst-order harmonic in conjunction\nwith the\n2 resonance.\nIn order to design the CPW ﬁlters with relatively wide\nbandwidth, one usually ﬁnds out that the coupling degree of\ntwo traditional lumped coupling elements, as illustrated in\nFigs. 1(a) and 2(a), is not sufﬁciently large especially at low\nfrequency range, under the limitation of fabrication tolerance.\nT o effectively address this issue, several parallel-coupled\nManuscript received January 29, 2004; revised July 14, 2004.

In this work, the two simple\n4 impedance transformers with low and high characteristic\nimpedances are studied with the conﬁgurations as shown in\nFigs. 1(b) and 2(b), and they are then utilized as alternative\nK- and J-inverters for design of\nCPW bandpass ﬁlter with\nwidened bandwidth. After their coupling behaviors are com-\nparatively studied via fullwave method of moments short-open\ncalibration (MoM-SOC) technique [6], [7], the improved\nsecond- and fourth-order\n4 CPW bandpass ﬁlters are de-\nsigned and predicted results are then supported by experiment\nover a wide frequency range.\nII.

Mean-\nwhile, Fig. 2(c) is the equivalent J-inverter network of series-ca-\npacitive coupling structures in Fig. 2(a) and (b). Their parame-\nters, including K-inverter impedance (K) and J-inverter admit-\ntance (J), can be derived in terms of two sets of closed-form\nequations under the equivalence of two networks for the same\nphysical layout.\nFor instances, the normalized K-impedance and J-admit-\ntance, i.e.,\nand , can be explicitly expressed in terms of\nthe normalized characteristic admittances and impedances,\n, and , with resorting to those of their two\nCPW feeding lines 1/4\n(1)\n(2)\nwhere denotes the electrical length or phase of the CPW trans-\nformers with the length (L) while denotes the equivalent phase\nat the two sides of J- or K-inverter.\nLet’ sa t ﬁrst consider the CPW K- and J-inverter structures\nwith the ﬁ xed 50 feeding lines fabricated on the R T/Duroid\n6010 with the permittivity of 10.8 and thickness of\n0.635 mm.

As the slot width is reduced from 0.570 mm\n(50 case) to 0.127 mm, with solid line is observed\nto gradually fall down around the frequency range of 4.\nIn the meantime, of lumped-K element in Fig. 1(a)\nseems linear increment with the frequency and the relevant\nslope or coupling degree gets slight enlarged as the gap width\ndecreases. By comparing these two sets of graphs, the pro-\nposed transformer-based K-inverter is seen to have much high\ncoupling strength rather than its traditional counterpart.\nFig. 3.

(b) J-inverter structures.\nFig. 3(b) illustrates the two sets of normalized J-inverter\nstructures in Fig. 2(b) and (a). By widening the slot width\nin the CPW transformer, the normalized is again ob-\nserved to fall down below the unity value around the frequency\nrange of\n. In parallel, of the traditional one goes\nup as the frequency increases and the gap width decreases,\nbut its coupling quantity is still very smaller than that of the\nproposed one.\nIII. I\nMPROVED CPW BANDP ASSFIL TERS\nBased on the above-discussed coupling behaviors, the two\nCPW impedance transformers are used as an enhanced K- or\nJ-inverter for design of\nCPW ﬁlters [3], [4] with relatively\nwide bandwidth. Fig. 4(a) is the layout of the second-order\n4 CPW bandpass ﬁlter. Herein, the transformer with\nlow impedance is constructed and put at both input and output\nin order to effectively use its high K-impedance as derived in\nFig. 3(a). Furthermore, the two\n4 CPW resonators are linked\ntogether via series capacitive gap coupling element with small\nJ-admittance as in Fig. 3(b).\nAs discussed in [8], each CPW step discontinuity can be mod-\neled as a single shunt capacitance while the uniform CPW sec-\ntion with different transversal dimensions can be modeled in\nterms of their characteristic impedances and effective dielectric\nconstants. Thus, a uniﬁed equivalent cascaded network can be\nformulated to implement the optimization design of the whole\nZHU et al.: COUPLING BEHA VIORS OF QUAR TER-W A VELENGTH IMPEDANCE TRANSFORMERS 15\nFig. 4.

Fig. 4(b) il-\nlustrates the two sets of S-parameters in a wide frequency range.\nOur network-predicted results exhibit us a few attractive perfor-\nmances of this ﬁlter, e.g., widened passband of about 28% at\nthe central frequency of 5.5 GHz and complete suppression of\nthe ﬁrst-order harmonic around 11.0 GHz. Measured results are\nobserved in reasonable agreement with predicted ones over the\nrange and some visible discrepancies among them may be pri-\nmarily caused by theoretically approximate characterization of\nmetallic thickness especially around CPW transformer.\nIn order to achieve the better bandpass behavior with higher\nrejection outside the passband, a fourth-order\n4 CPW band-\npass ﬁlter, as shown in Fig. 5(a), is further designed. Based\non the different quantities of coupling degree as illustrated in\nFig. 3(a) and (b), the series-inductively end-coupled element is\narranged at the center considering its weak K-impedance while\nthe CPW impedance transformers and capacitive gap-coupling\nelements are still used as before. Network-based optimization\nis carried out toward the return loss\nless than 20 dB\nwithin the passband. Fig. 5(b) shows the predicted S-parameters\ntogether with the measured ones. Predicted results clearly ex-\nhibit us the four transmission poles within the passband. More-\nover, both the two sets of graphs demonstrate that the upper stop-\nband with the range of 7.0 to 15.0 GHz is signiﬁcantly lowered\nwhile the bandpass behavior gets a great improvement with very\nsteep rejection outside the passband.\nIV .

Derived results indicate us that the\n4\nimpedance transformer can achieve highly enhanced inductive\nor capacitive coupling degree. Afterwards, the second- and\nfourth-order\n4 CPW bandpass ﬁlters are designed with the\nwidened passband of about 25–30% and they are realized via\nenhanced K-impedance of a\n4 CPW transformer with lower\ncharacteristic impedance. Relevant predicted results are then\nconﬁrmed by our experiment over a wide frequency range.\nR\nEFERENCES\n[1] D. F . Williams and S. E.
