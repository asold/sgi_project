INTRODUCTION  \nArtificial intelligence (AI) has been increasingly \nintegrated into educational settings with the goal of enhancing \nstudent learning experiences and improving teaching \npractices. AI -powered educational tools can offer \npersonalized learning experiences, automate routine tasks, and \noffer real -time feedback and assessment.  Chen et al.  [1] \ninvestigated the impact of AI on education, focusing on its \napplication in administration, instruction, and learning. The \nstudy concluded that AI has been widely adopted and used in \neducation in various forms, from computer technologies to \nhumanoid robots and chatbots. The use of AI has enabled \ninstructors to perform administrative functions more \neffectively and customize content based on students' needs, \nimproving the overall quality of learning.  Dao et al.  [2] \ndiscusses the use of AI in education to reduce workload and \nenhance learner engagement in online learning. The approach \ninvolves using text -to-speech and speech -driven-face \ntechnology to automatically create a video lecture with the \ninstructor's voice and face without the need for recording the \nvideo, allowing for easy modification. Experimental  results \nvalidated the approach. Nguyen et al.  [3] proposes an online \nlearning platform with a Vietnamese Virtual Assistant to help \ninstructors present lessons and assess learners. Lesson content \nis delivered through slides that are combined with  a \nsynthesized voice and the face of the instructor, enabling easy \nediting without the need for video recording. \nLLMs are a type of artificial intelligence technology that \ncan process and analyze vast amounts of natural language \ndata. These models have shown significant potential in a \nvariety of applications, including language translation, content \ncreation, and even edu cation. In 2018, Google introduced \nBERT[4], a pre -trained model that uses the Transformer \narchitecture and has achieved impressive results in various \nnatural language processing tasks due to training on a vast \ncorpus of text. RoBERTa [5] introduced by Facebook in 2019, \nis an extension of BERT that uses a similar architecture but is \ntrained on a larger corpus of text with longer sequences and \nmore iterations. Introduced in 2019 by Google researchers, T5 \n[6] is a large language model that uses a unified text -to-text \napproach, converting all tasks to te xt-to-text format and \ntraining them in a single model. T5 has achieved state-of-the-\nart performance on various natural language processing tasks. \nOpenAI's 2020 GPT -3 [7] is among the largest pre -trained \nlanguage models to date. It has extensive training data and can \nperform various NLP tasks with few examples, garnering \npraise for its performance. \nChemistry datasets are crucial for training LLMs to \nunderstand and predict various molecular properties. This has \nenormous implications for drug discovery, material design, \nand many other applications, as LLMs can help identify \npromising molecules from vast chemical spaces with high \naccuracy and speed. With the increasing interest in LLMs for \nchemistry, there is a growing need for large, diverse, and high-\nquality chemistry datasets that can provide sufficient chemical \nand structural information to effectively train these models. In \n[8], the author trained an efficient transformer encoder model, \nMoLFormer, on SMILES sequences of 1.1 billion unlabeled \nmolecules and showed that utilizing the learned molecular \nrepresentation outperforms existing baselines on downstream \nmolecular property prediction tasks.  In another, Monteiro et \nal. [9] investigate ChatGPT's understanding of chemistry by \npresenting five simple tasks from different subareas and \ndiscusses the model's limitations.  \nAs LLMs continue to advance, their potential and \nchallenges in education become increasingly apparent. \nHowever, to effectively implement these models in education, \nparticularly in Vietnam where the primary language is \nVietnamese, comprehensive evaluations of their capabilities \nare essential, particularly in the field of high school chemistry. \nDespite this, no research has yet been conducted on this topic, \nand there are few datasets available to evaluate LLMs in high \nhttps://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2023-kxxpd ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5415-7538 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0\n2 \n \nschool chemistry. To address this gap, we developed the \nVNHSGE dataset [10], which includes data from Vietnamese \nnational exams coveri ng nine subjects, including chemistry. \nThe dataset consists of 19K multiple-choice questions and 300 \nessays on literature and includes both text and images, with \nJson and Word formats provided. \nThis article makes the following contributions: (1) A \ncomprehensive evaluation of the performance of two of the \nmost advanced language models, ChatGPT and BingChat, in \nthe context of high school level chemistry education in \nVietnam. (2) A comparative analysis of the capabilities of \nChatGPT and BingChat against those of Vietnamese students. \n(3) A critical discussion on the potential benefits and \nchallenges of deploying large language models in the field of \nchemistry education in Vietnam. \nII. RELATED WORK \nA. Large Language Models \nChatGPT is a large language model based  on GPT -3.5, \ntrained by OpenAI on massive amounts of text data, capable \nof generating human-like responses to natural language input. \nIts potential applications in education include intelligent \ntutoring systems that can provide personalized feedback and \nautomate grading and assessment, as well as the creation of \nengaging educational content on various topics to supplement \nexisting teaching materials or create entirely new courses.  \nMicrosoft Bing Chat, or BingChat, is a chatbot feature of the \nBing search eng ine that provides accurate information and \ngenerates content such as poems and stories. It has potential \nas an educational tool to assist students with homework and \naid teachers in lesson preparation. BingChat can find relevant \ninformation and educational resources, and generate content \nthat can be incorporated into lessons, making it a valuable \nresource for both students and teachers. \nB. Evaluation of LLMs on Chemistry   \nThe author in [11] explores the application of ChatGPT in \nchemistry for generating articles and experimental designs. \nThey also discuss questions regarding AI's use in chemistry \neducation, research, academic integrity, critical thinking \ndevelopment, scientific publishing, fairness, accessibility, and \npotential applications. Marjour et al. [12] examines the use of \nChatGPT in generating articles and experimental designs in \nchemistry and raises concerns related to AI's use in chemistry \neducation, research, academic integrity, critical thinking \ndevelopment, scientific publishing, fairness, accessibility, and \npotential applications.  Castro et al.  [9] presented five \nchemistry tasks to evaluate the LLM's ability to understand \nchemistry, and they concludes that LLMs have limitations in \nunderstanding the subject, despite their seemingly valid \ngenerated answers, as they lack the ability to reason or \ndemonstrate understanding.  Fergus et al.  [13] evaluated \nChatGPT's ability to answer ch emistry assessment questions \nand its impact on learning and assessment. ChatGPT performs \nwell in answering knowledge and understanding -related \nquestions but has limitations in processing questions that \nrequire non -text information interpretation. ChatGPT \ntechnology is not a high -risk tool for cheating, and the study \ndiscusses its role in academic integrity and assessment design \ndiscussions. Leon et al. [14] found that neither multiple-choice \nnor free response prompt formats achieved scores higher than \n37%. This suggests that there is a limitation to the ability of \nChatGPT to accurately answer chemistry questions, \nparticularly those that require critical thinking and problem -\nsolving skills. White et al. [15] evaluated the ability of LLMs \nto solve chemistry problems posed as coding tasks. They \nintroduce a framework to evaluate chemistry knowledge and \nfind that recent LLMs can write correct code in various \nchemistry topics, with an increase in accuracy of 30 \npercentage points using prompt engineering strategies. The \ndataset and evaluation tools are open source for future \nresearchers, and the authors sugg est good practices for \nemploying LLMs in chemistry. The success of these models \nhas enormous potential for impacting chemistry teaching and \nresearch. OpenAI's GPT -4 Report  [16] revealed that \nChatGPT-3.5's accuracy on the AP chemistry dataset ranges \nbetween 22% and 46%. This suggests that while ChatGPT has \nthe potential to revolutionize education, more work needs to \nbe done to improve its accuracy in specialized domains such \nas chemistry.   \nIII. DATASET \nThe dataset used in this research comprises official and \nillustrative exam questions obtained from various sources, \nincluding the Vietnamese Ministry of Education and Training, \nhigh schools, and teachers. The questions were collected from \nexams conducted between 2019 and 2023 and cover a wide \nrange of subjects, such as mathematics, literature, english, \nphysics, chemistry, biology, history, geography, and civic \neducation. These questions were classified into four levels of \ndifficulty, name ly \"knowledge (easy),\" \"comprehension \n(intermediate),\" \"application (difficult),\" and \"high \napplication (very difficult),\" which offer a comprehensive \nrange of challenges to evaluate students' abilities and \nexpertise. \nA. Chemistry Testing of Vietnamese High School \nGraduation Examinations  \nIn Vietnam, the Chemistry graduation examination \nconstitutes a vital component of the annual high school \ngraduation examination. It is categorized under the Natural \nSciences combination, and students are allotted a duration of \n50 minutes to respond to 40 questions. \nB. Question Levels \nThe VNHSGE dataset encompasses a diverse range of \nquestions that assess various levels of difficulty, from \nfundamental knowledge to complex problem -solving that \nrequires the analysis and synthesis of information. To evaluate \nthe LLMs' performance comprehensively, we categorized the \nquestions into four levels based on the cognitive activities and \nverbs required to answer them: knowledge, comprehension, \napplication, and high application. This approach allows us to \ngain a comprehensive understanding of the capabilities and \nlimitations of LLMs in addressing different types of problems \nin chemistry education. \nC. Question Topics \nThe VNHSGE chemistry dataset [10] consists of 50 sets \nof examination t ests consisting of a total of 2000 multiple-\nchoice questions. These questions encompass a broad range of \nchemistry topics, including metallurgy, alkali metals, alkaline \nearth metals, aluminum, iron, inorganic chemical synthesis, \nesters, lipids, amines, ami no acids, proteins, carbohydrates, \npolymers, and polymer materials. The tests assess students' \nknowledge of organic chemistry content such as synthesis, \nelectrolysis, nitrogen-phosphorus chemistry, hydrocarbons, as \nwell as alcohols and phenols. \nhttps://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2023-kxxpd ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5415-7538 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0\n3 \n \nD. Score spectrum of Vietnamese students in 2019-2022 \nThe score distribution is a way to represent the scores of \ncandidates in a specific subject. Typically, these scores are \npresented in the form of a chart, with one axis indicating the \nscore and the other axis indicat ing the number of candidates \nwho achieved that score.  \n \nFig. 1. Score spectrum of Vietnamese students in 2022. \nFig. 1 shows the analysis of the 2022 national high school \ngraduation exam results in Chemistry shows that there were \n327,370 candidates taking the chemistry exam, with an \naverage score of 6.7 points and a median score of 7.0 points. \nThe most common score was 8.0 points. There were 43 \ncandidates with a score of ≤1 (0.01%); and 49,900 candidates \nwith a score below the average (15.24%). The score \ndistribution is published annually by the Vietnamese Ministry \nof Education and is displayed as a chart for each subject. The \nscore distribution is used to classify the level of proficiency \nand ability of candidates and to evaluate them based on \npredefined standards.  It is also used to test and evaluate \ncandidates according to a certain standard and to classify test \npapers by difficulty level, thereby evaluating the quality of \nthe candidates. We collected score distributions from 2019 -\n2022 [10]. By comparing the results of large language models \nwith the results of Vietnamese students, we can evaluate the \nability of LLMs. \nE. VNHSGE dataset  \nWord format : To suit language models like BERT or \nGPT, formulas, equations, and figures are converted into text \nformat. VNHSGE dataset provides a Word file in text format \nfor non -programmers to evaluate LLM performance. \nHowever, symbols, tables, images are also converted. \nVNHSGE dataset is appropriate for full LMs such as \nChatGPT and BingChat. \nJson format: The JSON format efficiently handles both \nsyntactical and content-related information in text, making it \nideal for LLM input data. Its flexibility and extensibility \nenable storage of diverse text data, including equations, \nformulas, tables, and images. The VNHSGE dataset i s well-\nsuited for JSON format, ensuring compatibility with multiple \nLLMs and development of more reliable language models. \nSamples: We will now introduce some questions in \nVietnamese. To translate the questions and answers into \nEnglish, we utilized ChatGPT  and BingChat. However, it's \nimportant to note that in some cases, both models, especially \nBingChat, may answer Vietnamese questions in English.  \nThe first type of question is at the knowledge level, where \nno reasoning is required to find the answer. \nCâu hỏi: Chất nào sau đây là chất điện li yếu? \nA.

What is the formula of Y? \nA. C3H5(OH)3 B. C2H5OH C. C3H7OH D. CH3OH \n \nThe next question is at the application level, which \nrequires inference to find the solution. \nCâu hỏi: Cho hai chất hữu cơ mạch hở E, F có cùng công thức đơn giản \nnhất là CH2O.

EXPERIMENTS  \nWe evaluated ChatGPT and BingChat on the evaluation \nset of  VNHSGE dataset  [10] consisting of five illustrative \nexams (200 multiple -choice questions) provided by the \nVietnamese Ministry of Education and Training for the years \n2019-2023. In this section, we present the evaluation results \nof ChatGPT (Feb 13 version) and BingChat (Mar 28) on this \nsubdataset. \nA. ChatGPT and BingChat Responses \nIn this section, we introduce the responses of ChatGPT and \nBingChat from the previous samples. First, for the knowledge \nlevel question, ChatGPT gives a correct answer while \nBingChat provides assistance but does not fully answer the \nquestion. Although it does not provide a solution, BingChat \nprovides direction for problem-solving.  \nSolution: Electrolysis equation is CH3COOH ⇄ CH3COO-+H+. Choose A \nChatGPT: A. CH3COOH is a weak electrolyte because it only partially \ndissociates in an aqueous solution. \nBingChat: I'm sorry but I cannot answer the question in the structure you \nrequested. I can only provide you with some information that may help \nyou find the answer yourself. A weak electrolyte is an electrolyte that does \nnot completely dissociate in aqueous solution. The solution will contain \nboth ions and molecules of the electrolyte. Weak electrolytes only partially \nionize in water (usually 1% to 10%), while strong electrolytes completely \nionize (100%). [^2^] Weak acids and weak bases are weak electrolytes. In \ncontrast, strong acids, strong bases, and salts are strong electrolytes. [^2^] \nSome examples of weak electrolytes are acetic acid, carbonic acid, \nammonia, and phosphoric acid.  \nThe next case shows that ChatGPT and BingChat fail to \nfind the correct answer. Even though the chemical reaction \nequation is a common equation.  \nSolution: C2H5COOCH3+NaOH→C2H5COONa+CH3OH. Choose D.  \nChatGPT: The molecular formula of Este X is C 4H8O2. When X is \nhydrolyzed in excess NaOH solution, the product obtained is a mixture of \nsodium propionate and alcohol Y.  The formula of Y  is: The general \nformula of an ester is RCOOR', where R and R' are carbon and hydrogen \ngroups. When an ester is hydrolyzed w ith excess NaOH solution, it is \nbroken down into a salt of carboxylic acid and alcohol. In this case, Este \nX will be broken down into sodium propionate and an alcohol with a \ngeneral formula of R'OH.  The formula of sodium propionate is \nC3H5COONa, so the rem aining part of Este X has a formula of \nCH3CH2CO-. Therefore, R' is a butyl group and alcohol Y has a formula \nof C4H9OH. Therefore, the answer is: C. C3H7OH. \nBingChat: The correct answer is B. C2H5OH. X is ethyl propionate ester \nwith the molecular formula C4H8O2. When X is hydrolyzed in excess \nNaOH solution, the product is sodium propionate and ethyl alcohol (Y) \nwith the formula C2H5OH. \nFor the question at the application level, which requires \ncomprehensive knowledge to infer the correct answer, both \nChatGPT and BingChat were unable to find a solution.  \nSolution: The correct statements include: a, b, and đ. \nE, F have the formula (CH2O)n ⇒ 30n < 100 ⇒ n < 3.33; E, F react with \nNaOH ⇒ n ≥ 2. n = 2, E: C2H4O2: HCOOCH3 ⇒ X: HCOONa; Y: \nCH3OH; T: HCOOH.. n = 3, F: C3H6O3: HCOOCH2CH2OH ⇒ Z: \nC2H4(OH)2 \n(a) True. HCOONa \n𝐴𝑔𝑁𝑂3/𝑁𝐻3\n→        AgN  \n(b) True. CH3OH + CO\n𝑥𝑡,𝑡0\n→  CH3COOH \n(c) False. C2H4(OH)2 + 2CuO \n𝑥𝑡,𝑡0\n→   (CHO)2 + 2Cu + 2H2O \n(d) False. F does not have an acidic environment, so it does not change \nthe color of litmus paper to red. \n(đ) True. HCOOH (100.8oC) has a higher boiling point than C2H5OH \n(78.3oC) due to stronger and more stable hydrogen bonds. Choose D.  \nChatGPT: From the given reactions, we can write the fo llowing \nequations: \nE + NaOH → X + Y; F + NaOH → X + Z; X + HCl → T + NaCl \nSince E and F have the same simplest formula CH 2O, they must be \nstructural isomers of each other, with different arrangements of their \natoms. Let's assume that E is formaldehyde (HCHO) and F is acetaldehyde \n(CH3CHO). Then we can write the following reactions: \nHCHO + NaOH → X + H2O (equation 1) \nCH3CHO + NaOH → X + CH3OH (equation 2) \nFrom equation 1, we can see that Y is H2O, and from equation 2, we can \nsee that Z is CH3OH. So now we have: \nE + NaOH → X + H2O; F + NaOH → X + CH3OH; X + HCl → T + NaCl \nFrom statement (a), we know that X can undergo silver plating reaction, \nwhich is a characteristic reaction of aldehydes. Therefore, X must be an \naldehyde. From statement (d), we know that F turns litmus red, indicating \nthat it is acidic. Acetaldehyde (F) is slightly acidic due to the presence of \nthe carbonyl group. Therefore, statement (d) is correct . From statement \n(e), we know that T has a higher boiling point than ethyl alcohol. This \nindicates that T has stronger intermolecular forces than ethyl alcohol,  \nwhich is due to the presence of a larger molecule or polar groups. Since T \nis formed from X, which is an aldehyde, it must be an aldol or a ketone, \nboth of which have higher boiling points than alcohols. Therefore, \nstatement (e) is also correct. From statement (b), we know that acetic acid \ncan be directly synthesized from Y. Since Y is H2O, it cannot directly \nform acetic acid. Therefore, statement (b) is incorrect. From statement (c), \nwe know that Z is oxidized by CuO to form acetic aldehyde. This is \nincorrect, as Z is CH3OH, which cannot be oxidized to form acetaldehyde. \nhttps://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2023-kxxpd ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5415-7538 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0\n5 \n \nTherefore, statement (c) is incorrect. Thus, the number of correct \nstatements is 2, corresponding to option (B). \nBingChat: Based on the search results, two open -chain organic \ncompounds tha t can have the formula CH2O are formaldehyde and \nglucose. Formaldehyde is an aldehyde with a carbonyl group (C=O) \nattached to two hydrogen atoms, while glucose is a monosaccharide with \nan aldehyde group and five hydroxyl (OH) groups attached to a six-carbon \nchain. The simplest formula CH2O is also known as the empirical formula \nof carbohydrates. B.1.  \nFor the question requiring deep inference, both ChatGPT \nand BingChat were unable to provide useful information and \ntheir approach was completely unreasonable.  \nSolution: Chemical equations in the problem: \nCuSO4 + 2NaCl → Cu↓ + Cl2↑ + Na2SO4 (1) \n2NaCl + 2H2O → H2↑ + Cl2↑ + 2NaOH (2) \n2Al + 2NaOH + 2H2O → 2NaAlO2 + 3H2↑ (3) \n2H2O → 2H2 + O2 (4) \nLet the number of moles of CuSO 4 in the electrolysis reaction (1) be \nmolCuSO4 =x→molNaCl =2x. Since the ratio of CuSO 4: NaCl is 1:3, \nthere is still an excess of x moles of NaCl. From chemical equation (2), \nthe number of moles of NaOH formed is molNaOH =x. Based on \nchemical equation (3), the  number of moles of H2 is: molH2 =\n1.5x. According to the information given in the problem, we have 1.5x = \n0.15 → x = 0.1. The weight loss due to the vaporization of Cl2 and H2 in \nchemical reactions (1) and (2) is m1+2 =17.15. Let y be the number of \nmoles of H2 in the chemical equation (4), the weight loss of the solution \nis mtotal =17.15+18y=20.75→y=0.2. We obtain ne =2nCu +\n2nH2 =2.0.1+2(0.05+0.2)=0.7. We have ne =It/96500→t=\n(96500x0.7)/2.68=25205(s)=7 hours → Choose C. \nChatGPT: The reactions that occur during electrolysis are as follows:  \nAt the negative electrode: 2H_2O + 2e^- -> H_2 + 2OH^-. At the positive \nelectrode: Cu^{2+} + 2e^- -> Cu. Since the mole ratio of CuSO_4 to NaCl \nis 1:3, the mole ratio of Cu^{2+} and Na^+ in the initial solution is 1:6.  \nThe number of moles of water electrolyzed to produce hydrogen is 2/(2 + \n6) = 1/4 of the initial solution. The mass of the dissolved substance \nremaining after electrolysis is: m(Y) = m( \\rm CuSO_4) + m(NaCl) - \nm(H_2O) = 20.75 g .Let x be the number of moles of CuSO_4 initially, \nhence the number of moles of NaCl initially is 3x. We have the following \nsystem of equations:  x - 2nCu = 0 (1) 3x - nNa = 0 (2). Moreover, we have \nthe reaction equation when adding Al into solution Y: 2Al + 6 H_2O + \n8OH^- -> 3H_2 + 2Al(OH)_6^{3 -}. The number of moles of H_2 \nproduced is the number of moles of water electrolyzed multiplied by 3, \nand since the electrolysis efficiency is 100%, the number of moles of Al \ninvolved in the reaction is equal to the numbe r of moles of H_2. The \nnumber of moles of Al reacting with Cu^{2+} and Na^+ to form Cu and \nNa ions are: nCu = x/2 nNa = 3x/2 The number of moles of Al needed to \nproduce the corresponding number of moles of Cu and Na is: n = (nCu + \nnNa)/2 = 2.5x/2 = 1.25x \nBingChat: The electrolysis of CUSO 4 and NaCl solution with inert \nelectrodes (such as graphite) and a diaphragm produces hydrogen gas at \nthe cathode and chlorine gas at the anode. The porous diaphragm prevents \nthe explosive reaction between hydrogen and chlorine. The reactions are: \n… Choose B. 4.    \nB. Performance \n1) Question order:  \nThe ordering of questions is related to their difficulty level. \nThe questions are categorized as follows: questions 1 -20 \ncorrespond to the knowledge level, questions 20 -30 \ncorrespond to the comprehension level, and questions 30 -40 \ncorrespond to the application and high application level, with \nthe latter typically focusing on questions 35-40. \nTable I displays the results obtained by ChatGPT and \nBingChat in the order of questions. Additionally, we propose \ntwo values, Max and Min. Max represents the best -case \nscenario for ChatGPT and BingChat, i.e., the models' ability \nto provide correct answers. On the other hand, Min represents \nthe worst-case scenario for ChatGPT and BingChat, i.e., the \nmodels' ability to provide incorrect answers (1-Min). \nMax={0 if ChatGPT =0 and BingChat = 0\n1  otherwise  \nMin={1 if ChatGPT =1 and BingChat = 1\n0  otherwise  \nTABLE I.  ACCURACY \nQuestion Order ChatGPT BingChat Max Min \n1 1 0 1 0 \n2 0 1 1 0 \n3 0 1 1 0 \n4 0 0 0 0 \n5 1 1 1 1 \n  \nThe quantities Max and Min provide us with the ability to \nassess the best and worst performance of LLMs on the \nVNHSGE dataset. For instance, for question \"x\", ChatGPT \ngave the correct answer while BingChat gave the wrong one, \nso Max is true (value \"1\") and Min is false (value \"0\"). As the \norder of the questions is linked to their difficulty, we can \nevaluate the accuracy of the answers based on the question \norder, enabling us to determine the LLMs' ability based on the \nlevel of question difficulty. \nThe 5 -year average results are illustrated in Fig. 2. The \ndata indicates that ChatGPT's ability to provide more than \n50% accurate answers is for questions 1 -21. However, for \nquestions 20 -40, the accuracy of ChatGPT's answers \ndecreases significantly to 0. On the other hand, BingChat, \nMin, and Max have an ability to answer correctly more than \n50% for questions 1 -24, 1 -16, and 1 -27 respectively. \nHowever, from question 24 onwards, the correct answer rate \nfor Min is approximately 0%. Upon analyzing the accuracy of \nanswers provided by ChatGPT and BingChat, it can be \nconcluded that both models are only capable of answering \nquestions at the knowledge and comprehension leve ls, and \nstruggle to solve questions at the application and high \napplication levels. \n \nFig. 2.

ChatGPT achieved the highest score of \n62.5 in 2021 and the lowest of 40 in 2019, while BingChat \nobtained the highest score of 57.5 in 2020 and the lowest of \n47.5 in 2022. The Min and Max values showed their best and \nworst performances in 2022 and 2021, respectively. ChatGPT \noutperformed BingChat in 2021 only. The bar chart indicates \nstable performance but varying relative performance across \nyears. Further evaluation is required to determine the optimal \nmethod for specific tasks. \nTABLE II.

The \nfindings indicate that BingChat exhibits higher stability \ncompared to ChatGPT. This observation is expected, given \nthat BingChat employs a search engine mechanism, whereas \nChatGPT has a more imaginative approach. \n \n \nFig. 3. Stability of LLMs response. \nC. Comparision to other exam  \nFig. 4 compares the performance of ChatGPT  and \nBingChat on VNHSGE dataset and the performance of \nChatGPT of the AP Chemistry dataset from OpenAI  [16]. \nOpenAI reported ChatGPT achieved a score range of 22% -\n46%. On the VNHSGE dataset, ChatGPT scored 48%, \nBingChat scored 52.5%, and our test case achieved the highest \nscore of 67.5%, while a minimum of 33%. \n \n \nFig. 4. Performance on VNHSGE dataset and other exams. \nD. Comparision to Vietnamese students  \nTo assess the performance of the LLMs, we compare their \nresults with those of Vietnamese students. Table III displays \nthe converted scores of ChatGPT and BingChat, the average \nscore (AVNS), and the score attained by the highest -\nperforming Vietnamese student (MVNS). The average scores \nof ChatGPT, BingChat, Min, and Max are 4.8, 5.25, 3.3, and \n6.75, respectively. The average score of Vietnamese students \nfor 2019-2022 is 5.35, 6.71, 6.63, and 6.7. We can infer that \nChatGPT and BingChat have lower scores than the average \nscore of Vietnamese students. However, Max exhibits a better \noutcome than the average score of Vietnamese students, but it \nis still lower than the score obtained by the highest-performing \nVietnamese student \nTABLE III.

DISCUSSION  \nLanguage Models, including Large Language Models \n(LLMs), have the potential to revolutionize education by \nproviding students with personalized and interactive learning \nexperiences. With their ability to process and analyze vast \namounts of data, LLMs can provide tailored feedback and \nadapt to individual students' learning styles. They can also \nassist in grading and assessing student work, reducing the \nworkload on teachers.  However, the res ults of this study \nsuggest that LLMs such as ChatGPT and BingChat currently \nhave limited ability in answering high -level application \nquestions in Chemistry at the high school level. The accuracy \nhttps://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2023-kxxpd ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5415-7538 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0\n7 \n \nof their responses is also lower than that of Vietnamese \nstudents. This highlights the challenges that LLMs face in \nadapting to the nuances and complexities of natural language, \nparticularly in specialized domains such as chemistry. Despite \nthese challenges, there is great potential for LLMs to improve \neducational outcomes, especially in countries where access to \nquality education is limited. LLMs can provide students with \naccess to high -quality resources and personalized feedback, \nregardless of their location or socio -economic status. \nMoreover, LLMs can be trained t o recognize and adapt to \nregional differences in language and culture, making them \nsuitable for use in diverse contexts such as Vietnam. However, \nto fully realize the potential of LLMs in education, several \nchallenges must be overcome. These include improv ing the \naccuracy and reliability of LLMs in specialized domains such \nas chemistry, developing tools and platforms that facilitate the \nintegration of LLMs into the classroom, and addressing \nconcerns around privacy and data security.  In summary, \nLLMs have the potential to transform education, including in \nthe field of Chemistry in Vietnam and around the world. \nHowever, their success will depend on their ability to \novercome the challenges and limitations identified in this \nstudy, and on the development of supp ortive policies and \ninfrastructure to ensure their effective integration into the \neducation system. \nVI. CONCLUSION \nIn conclusion, our study evaluated the performance of two \nLLMs, ChatGPT and BingChat, in answering chemistry \nquestions in Vietnamese high school exams from 2019-2023. \nThe results showed that both LLMs have limitations in \nanswering questions at the application and high application \nlevels, indicating their lack of ability to reason and apply \nknowledge. Moreover, when comparing the performance of \nChatGPT and BingChat, BingChat generally outperformed \nChatGPT in terms of accuracy.  We also compared the \nperformance of the LLMs with Vietnamese students' scores \nand found that both ChatGPT and BingChat have lower scores \nthan the average score of Vietnamese students, indicating that \nLLMs have limitations in replacing human intelligence in the \nfield of chemistry education.  However, LLMs still have \npotential in providing assistance for students and teachers in \nlearning and teaching activities, especially in providing instant \nfeedback and personalized learning experiences. LLMs can \nalso be used to generate questions and materials for practice \nand assessment. Additionally, LLMs can be improved by \nincorporating more domain -specific knowledge and \nenhancing their reasoning and application abilities.  Overall, \nwhile LLMs show promise in the field of education, they still \nface challenges and limitations that need to be addressed. \nFuture research can explore ways to improve LLMs' abilities \nto reason and apply knowled ge, as well as investigate their \neffectiveness in improving student learning outcomes. \n \nREFERENCES \n1.
