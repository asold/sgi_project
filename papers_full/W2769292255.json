    "abstract": "This study aims to quantify the transformer tap changer operations on distribution networks with large penetration of photovoltaic systems. The influence of solar generation variability on transformer tap changer is investigated by using five different solar variability day types collected in Malaysia with 1 min resolution. The case studies have been performed on a Malaysian representative distribution network. Results show that high solar variability day could increase the transformer's tap changes by 600% as compared to the clear sky day. The transformer's time delay setting plays a vital role in limiting the tap operations.",
