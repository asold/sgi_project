  "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Radiological imaging is one of the most frequently performed diagnostic tests worldwide. The free text contained in radiology reports is currently only rarely utilized for secondary use, including research and predictive analysis. However, this data might be made available by means of information extraction (IE), based on natural language processing (NLP). Recently, a new approach to NLP, large language models (LLMs), has gained momentum and continues to improve performance. The objective of this scoping review is to show the state of research regarding IE from free-text radiology reports based on LLMs, to investigate applied methods, and to guide future research by showing open challenges and limitations of current approaches. To our knowledge, no systematic nor scoping review of IE of radiology reports, based on LLMs, has been conducted yet. Existing publications are outdated and do not comprise LLM-based models. Methods and analysis This protocol is designed based on the JBI manual for evidence synthesis, chapter 11.2: “Development of a scoping review protocol”. Inclusion criteria and a search strategy comprising four databases (PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science Core Collection, ACM Digital Library) are defined. Furthermore, we describe the screening process, data charting, analysis and presentation of extracted data. Ethics and dissemination This protocol describes the methodology of a scoping literature review and does not comprise research on or with humans, animals or their data. Therefore, no ethical approval is required. After the publication of this protocol and the conduct of the review, its results are going to be published in an open access journal dedicated to biomedical informatics/ digital health. Strengths and limitations of this study This scoping review protocol strictly adheres to standardized guidelines for scoping review conduction, including JBI Manual for Evidence Synthesis and the PRISMA-ScR guideline. The search strategy comprises four databases: PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science Core Collection, and ACM Digital Library. This scoping review will close the knowledge gap present in the field of information extraction from radiology reports caused by the recent rapid technical process. According to the nature of a scoping review, identified sources of evidence are not critically appraised. The results of the scoping review will serve as a basis for defining further research directions regarding information extraction from radiology reports.",

With br east cancer being the “ second most c ommon \nmalignancy in the world” (3), mammogr aph y show s to reduce the risk of br east cancer \nmortality of women aged 50-69 with high certainty . This risk r eduction is based on \ntr eatment decisions that are in turn based on r adiology r eports where experts describe the \nfindings from the images. T raditionally , radiologist s create semi-structured free-text \nradiology reports describing findings and their interpr etation based on acquired images. \nStructured reporting, on the other hand, aims at impr oving clinical outcomes and \nstandardization by providing frameworks for report layouts and contents. However , \nimplementing structured reporting often requir es changes t o existing clinical processes. A \nconsequent temporary increase in workload f or radiologists makes it difficult to transf er \nstructur ed reporting into clinical practice due to r esistance among clinicians (4). Existing \ninformation could be made available by extracting clinically relevant information including \nits semantics and relations by applying natural language processing (NLP) methods. NLP is \ndefined as the “tract of Artificial Intelligence and Linguistics, devoted t o making computers \nunder stand the st at ements or words writt en in human languages” (5). Extr acted inf ormation \ncould be made available for secondary use, e.g., for pr ediction or research, based on \nmethods r elated to information extraction (IE).  \n \nIE is a subfield within NLP to extr act relevant information from text. Subtasks of IE include \namong others named entity recognition, r elation extraction, and template filling. T o solve \nthese subtask s, diff erent approaches might be applied: Basic approaches ar e based on \nheuristics. Machine learning-based approaches, on the contrary , include traditional methods \n(e.g., support vector machine, Naïve Bayes), or methods based on deep learning. Deep \nlearning, in turn, comprises, among o thers, recurr ent and convolutional neural networks as \nwell as - most recently developed - large language models (LLMs) (6).  \n \nLLMs  ar e «deep learning models with a huge number of parameter s tr ained in an \nunsupervised way on large volumes of text» (7). W e narrow this definition and only regard \nmodels with at least one million parameter s as LLMs. Most of t oday ’ s models are based on \nthe transformer ar chitecture, which was fir st described in 2017 (8). Since then, new LLMs \nhave been published on an ongoing basis, being trained on growing datasets and surpassing \nstate-of-research performance r egularly . W ell-known models include BER T (2018, (9)), \nMegatr on-ML (2019, (10)), GPT-3 (2020, (11)), GPT-4 and PaLM 2 (2023, (12,13)).  \n \nRegarding existing liter ature concerning IE fr om radiology reports, several reviews are \navailable, although these sour ces either miss t o include current developments or only focus \non a specific aspect or clinical domain. Applying NLP t o radiology reports for IE has already \nbeen focused on in two sy stematic reviews in 2016 (14) and 2021 (15). While the former is \nnot freely available, the latter sear ches Google Scholar only and includes just one study \nbased on LLMs. Mor e recent reviews include a specific scoping review on the application of \nNLP to r eports, specifically related to breast cancer (16) and a sy st ematic r eview on the \napplication of deep-learning-based NLP methods in radiology , although only including \n .

A search in PROSPERO , conducted on 30/05/2023, \nwith the search query “Natural Language Pr ocessing AND r adiology ” yielded twelve results. \nEleven results ar e not related t o IE from r adiology r eports. One regist ered review describes \nnamed entity recognition and relation extr action in clinical documents using NLP . However , \nthis review is neither focused on r adiology r eports nor LLM, and the sear ch pr ocess was last \nupdated on 07/07/2021, potentially missing many of r ecently published articles regarding \nthe application of LLMs (18). Theref ore, as LLMs have only recently gained momentum, a \nresearch gap exists and there is no overview of LLM-based appr oaches to IE fr om radiology \nreports available.  \n \nAs compared to a systematic r eview , a scoping review usually does not include a critical \nappraisal of the identified sour ces of evidence. On the other hand, conducting a scoping \nreview tak es f ewer r esour ces to perform and is ther efore especially suit able f or the \ndynamically changing resear ch ar ea f ocused on IE fr om radiology reports. With this pr otocol \nfor a scoping review , we therefore intend t o fill the identified r esearch gap and answer the \nfollowing research question:  \n \nWhat is  t he s t at e of  res ear c h  r egardin g infor matio n e xtr ac t i on f rom fr ee- t e xt radio logy \nrepor ts bas ed on Large Langua ge Mo dels?  \n \nSpecifically , we are interest ed in the sub-questions that arise from the posed research \nquestion, see T able 1. \n \nT ab le 1 : R es e a rch su b-q ues t i on s t o  be a n swe red based on the scopin g  rev i e w  \nRQ.01 – \nPerf ormance  \nWhat is the perf ormance of LLMs f or information extraction fr om radiology \nreports? \nRQ.02 – \nT raining and \nModelling \nWhich models are used and how is the pre-training and fine-tuning process \ndesigned? \nRQ.03 – Use \ncas es \nWhich modalities and anatomical r egions do the analyzed reports correspond \nto?  \nRQ.04 – \nDat a and \nannotation \nHow much data was used to tr ain the model, how was the annotation \nprocess designed and is the data publicly available? \nRQ.05 – \nChallenges  \nWhat ar e open challenges and common limitations of existing approaches? \n \nThe objective of this scoping review prot ocol is to answer the above-mentioned aspects, \ngive an overview of r ecent developments, and guide futur e r esear ch by showing open \nchallenges and limitations of curr ent approaches.  \n  \n .

This manual in turn complies with the specifications of the PRISMA Extension \nfor Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR), which provides a guideline on the design and \nmethodology of a scoping review (20).  \n \nThis protocol is designed specifically based on chapter 11.2 of the JBI manual: “Development \nof a scoping r eview protocol” . The manual defines sections and their cont ents t o be included \nin the pr otocol, comprising inclusion criteria, search strategy , sour ce of evidence selection, \ndata extraction, analysis of the evidence, and presentation of results. These aspect s are \ndescribed in the following chapters.  \n \nInclusion criteria \n \nIn T able 2, we describe the criteria to be applied in selecting sources of evidence (SOE). \nFocus was put on aligning these crit eria with the title as well as the r esearch question and \nsub-questions of the scoping review .  \n \nT a bl e  2 :  I nc l u s i on  c r it e r i a \nC.01 The full-t ext SOE is r etrievable.  \nC.02 The SOE was published after 31/12/2017. \nC.03 The SOE is published in a peer-reviewed journal or conf erence proceeding.  \nC.04 The SOE describes original research, excluding review s, comments, patents, \nand white paper s.  \nC.05 The SOE describes the application of NLP methods for the purpose of IE from \nfr ee-text radiology reports. \nC.06 The described approach is LLM-based (defined as deep learning models with \nmor e than one million parameters, trained on unlabeled text data).  \n \nSearch strategy \n \nThe chosen search strategy comprises three st eps: First, a limited search of at least two \ndatabases (PubMed, Google Scholar) is used to obtain a list of relevant index terms and \nk eywor ds, see T able 3. Next, based on this list of terms, a compr ehensive and systematic \nsear ch query is developed iteratively . \n \nT ab le 3 : Pri m a ry  se a rc h  t erm s  \nPubMed (information extraction) AND (radiolog*) AND (report*) AND (lar ge \nlanguage model) \nGoogle Scholar “information extr action radiology reports lar ge language model” \n \n \n \n .

The primary sear ch query will be \ndeveloped for usage with PubMed and then tr anslated t o be used for the other thr ee \ndatabases, where possible automatically (21). Each of the four search strings, including the \nnumber of retrieved records, date cover age, and dat e of sear ch, will be documented using a \nstandardized template pr ovided by Kar olinska Institutet (22).   \n \nAs a third and last st ep, after the selection pr ocess, ref erence lists of studies that ar e \nincluded in the review are sear ched for additional sources of evidence (“forward-search”). \nThis process might be support ed by aut omation t ools. \n \nSource of evidence selection \n \nThe SOE selection process will be conduct ed by two reviewer s individually . The r eview \nprocess is performed and managed using the software platform Rayyan (23). Before \nscr eening, duplicate r ecor ds ar e r emoved semi-automatically (manual check of aut omatically \nidentified duplicates) and a pilot testing pr ocedure is carried out to ensure agreemen t of \nboth r eviewer s on inclusion criteria: A r andom sample of 25 SOE entries is selected and \nassessed by both r eviewer s. Then, decision s are compared. In case of an y diff erences, \ninclusion crit eria are clarified and/or adapted. Screening is start ed only when an agr eement \nof >75% is achieved – otherwise, additional batches of ten SOE en tries are assessed similarly \nuntil the specified level of agr eement is reached. \n \nNext, all recor ds, consisting of titles and abstr acts, are scr eened by both reviewers and \nincluded if they fulfill all inclusion criteria. After completion, disagr eements are solved by \nthe decision of a third r eviewer . Then, full-t ex t retrieval is performed for all included records. \nRecords that cannot be r etrieved are excluded. Retrieved full texts are assessed for \neligibility: Sources that do not comply with all defined inclusion crit eria are excluded. Last, a \nforwar d search is performed using r eference lists of r emaining sour ces of evidence. See \nFigure 1 for an illustration of the described process.  \n .
