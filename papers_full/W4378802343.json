The  computa-\ntional  experiments  method  is  a  representative  method  [5].  Starting\nfrom  the  micro-scale,  it  cultivates  an “ artificial  society” of  the  real\nsystem  in  the  cyber  world.

The  knowledge  modeling  method  can\neffectively capture the essential characteristics and principal contra-\ndictions of the system, obtaining an effective model structure.

In  contrast,  data  modeling  method  has\nadvanced by leaps and bounds over the years. The advantage of data\nmodeling  is  that  it  can  automatically  acquire  the  information  and\nknowledge hidden in the data. But, it heavily relies on the quantity\nand quality of data samples, and conducting an in-depth analysis and\ninterpretation of the system mechanism can be difficult. As shown in\nFig. 1, the difference of the two methods can be visually represented\nby  the “ cognitive  gap” [6].

However, Chat-\nGPT, as the infrastructure of artificial intelligence generated content\n(AIGC),  has  the  potential  to  facilitate  the  automatic  generation  of\nthese models. Therefore, leveraging ChatGPT to enhance the compu-\ntational  experiments  method  shows  great  promise.  Secondly,  this\npaper will investigate how computational experiments can be used to\nimprove ChatGPT. While ChatGPT is adept at automatically process-\ning human-like events, it struggles with the problem of causal reason-\ning  in  complex  systems.  Computational  experiments,  on  the  other\nhand, excel at algorithmizing counterfactuals and prescribing results.\nTherefore, utilizing computational experiments to bolster ChatGPT’s\nperformance is a valuable area of inquiry.\nWhat is computational experiments?\nRestricted  by  methodology,  economy,  law,  ethics  and  other  ele-\nments,  traditional  experimental  methods  may  not  be  applicable  for\nstudying  such  complex  systems.  In  2004,  Wang  [7]  formally  pro-\nposed  the  ACP  (artificial  systems  +  computational  experiments  +\nparallel  execution)  method,  which  emphasizes  the  use  of  computa-\ntional  means  to  study  complex  systems.  As  shown  in Fig. 2,  this\napproach involves abstracting a software-defined model correspond-\ning to the real system − the artificial system. Through online learn-\ning, offline computing, virtual-real interaction, etc., the artificial sys-\ntem becomes a “social laboratory” that can be experimented on and\nprovides “reference”, “prediction” and “guidance” for the operation\nof the actual system. The parallel system adopts the view of “multi-\nworlds”, meaning that when modeling complex systems, the model is\nno  longer  evaluated  solely  based  on  its  degree  of  approximation  to\nthe real system, but instead, it is regarded as an alternative form and\nanother  possible  implementation  of  the  real  complex  system.  The\ncomputational  experiments  method  provides  a  digital  and  computa-\ntional method for quantitative analysis of complex systems.\n \nExperiment\ndesign\nArtificial\nsociety\nResearchers\nCyber-physical-social systems\nDomain\nmodeling\nScenario\nbuilding\nComputational\nexperiments\nStrategy\nadjustment \nStrategy\nevaluation\nValue \nprovision\nData flow\nPhysical space\nCyber space\nSocial space\nResource\nservice\nCloud\nservice\nFrom unstructured reality scenarios to\nstructured computing scenarios \nResearch activity\nResearch\nactivity \nWhat-if\nanalysis Service\nencapsulation\n \nFig. 2.

In  addition,  [5]  provides  a\ncomprehensive  review  of  the  development  status  and  future  chal-\nlenges of computational experiments method. As a scientific research\nmethodology,  computational  experiments  have  been  applied  to  sys-\ntems that pose high risks, high costs or are impossible to test directly\nin  reality.  Nevertheless,  the  application  of  computational  experi-\nments  method  also  exposes  some  challenges,  including  the  design\nand verification of computational model, the design and analysis of\ncomputational  experiments,  and  so  on.  Addressing  these  challenges\nwill  clear  the  obstacles  for  the  further  application  of  computational\nexperiments.\nWhat is ChatGPT?\nRecently, OpenAI’s ChatGPT has become a popular search, rekin-\ndling enthusiasm for AI among the tech community and the public.\nChatGPT  represents  a  significant  improvement  over  past  publicly\navailable chatbots, as it is able to engage in daily conversations and\nacquire  knowledge  relatively  reliably.  Moreover,  It  can  assist  with\nwriting  documents  and  codes  based  on  requirements  provided  by\nhumans, and even correct errors in text or bugs in code. In essence,\nChatGPT  is  the  integrator  of  Transformer,  GPT  and  relevant  tech-\nnologies  [9]−[11].  In  terms  of  technological  innovation,  ChatGPT\ncan be summarized as three points:\n1) General foundation models\nIn  the  field  of  natural  language  processing  (NLP)  research,  there\nare  hundreds  of  tasks,  including  text  classification,  information\nextraction, text understanding, etc., each requiring its own model and\nframework trained on specific data and made available to everyone.\nThe  emergence  of “ Foundation  model” has  promoted  a  shift  in  AI\nresearch  paradigm  [11].  ChatGPT  has  demonstrated  that  it  is  now\npossible  to  pursue  the  ideal  large  language  models  (LLM)  directly,\nwith characteristics mainly manifested in two aspects: a) LLM should\nhave a strong ability of autonomous learning and be capable of auto-\nmatically learning all the knowledge points contained in the massive\ndata without human intervention, while flexibly applying the knowl-\nedge to solve practical problems. LLM can be viewed as an implicit\nknowledge map embodied by model parameters. b) LLM should be\nable  to  solve  problems  in  any  subdomain  of  NLP,  not  just  limited\ndomains, and should even be able to respond to problems in domains\nother  than  NLP.  As  such,  future  research  trends  will  focus  on  con-\nstructing this ideal LLM rather than solving specific problems in one\ndomain.\n2) Interactive and linguistic intelligence\nThe primary objective of ChatGPT is to generate responses based\non user input, while aligning with the inherent goals of the language\nmodel,  which  aim  to  predict  the  most  likely  next  word  in  a  given\ncontext.  However,  ChatGPT  goes  beyond  this  by  generating\nresponses that are satisfactory to humans. To endow AI with human-\nlike  communication  capabilities,  ChatGPT  was  trained  using  rein-\nforcement learning with human-in-the-loop, 40 human labelers to be\nexact [12]. Traditional chatbots can be seen as a cyber-physical sys-\ntems  (CPS),  in  which  computing  (or  networking)  resources  are\ntightly  integrated  and  coordinated  with  physical  resources.  Now,\nChatGPT has evolved into a human-in-the-loop system (i.e., CPSS),\nwhich integrates human preferences in an organic and subtle manner\nto enable efficient and effective system operation [10].\n3) Imaginitive intelligence based on emergent Ability\nThe LLM model possesses an “emergent ability” that is dependent\non the scale of its parameters. When the model′s parameters fail to\nreach  a  certain  threshold,  it  is  unable  to  effectively  solve  certain\ntasks, which is evident in its poor performance and random selection\nof answers. However, there is a sudden increase in its effectiveness\nfor  such  tasks  when  its  size  exceeds  a  certain  threshold.  This  is\nremarkable because it suggests that while LLM may currently strug-\ngle  with  certain  tasks  or  lack  the  ability  to  solve  them  altogether,\nexpanding  the  model  may  eventually  unlock  this  ability  [13].  The\nimportant  source  of  open  creativity  in  LLM  is  the  diffusion  model\n[14].  By  integrating  massive  pre-training  data  and  introducing  ran-\ndomness  into  the  model,  unimaginable  creativity  can  be  generated.\nImaginitive  Intelligence  may  also  play  a  crucial  role  in  further\nenhancing ChatGPT’s reasoning capabilities.\nChatGPT for computational experiments\nArtificial society modeling serves as the foundation for conducting\ncomputational experiments [5], [15] and [16]. To create a computa-\ntional  model  that  is  logically  sound  and  accurate,  it  is  necessary  to\nsimplify and abstract the complex behaviors and phenomena found in\nreal social systems. In the case of complex systems like CPSS, signif-\nicant amounts of digital content are required to support the construc-\ntion  of  an  artificial  society  model.  Manual  design  and  development\ncannot meet this demand. Therefore, leveraging ChatGPT’s AI gen-\nerated content (AIGC) capabilities to aid in the automated design and\ngeneration  of  artificial  society  models  has  emerged  as  a  promising\nresearch  direction  in  this  field.  AIGC’s  abundant  creative  resources\nand  capabilities  are  poised  to  revolutionize  the  way  artificial  soci-\neties are currently constructed.\nAs  shown  in Fig. 3,  ChatGPT  has  powerful  intelligent-  assisted\nprogramming  capabilities  that  promote  the  design  of  computational\nexperiments,  which  consists  of  three  parts:  1)  Generation  of  intelli-\ngent  agent.  The  intelligent  agent  can  be  an “agent”  or  a “digital\n 1358 IEEE/CAA JOURNAL OF AUTOMATICA SINICA, VOL. 10, NO. 6, JUNE 2023\nhuman”. These modeled agent or digital humans are created as code\nthrough  AIGC  technology,  which  can  present  various  human-like\ncharacteristics such as heterogeneity, bounded rationality, and learn-\ning evolution. 2) Generation of virtual environments. It includes both\nphysical  environment  and  social  environment.  Model  as  a  service\n(MaaS),  which  combines  knowledge  modeling  and  data  modeling,\nhas gradually become the underlying infrastructure for building envi-\nronment  models.  3)  Generation  of  evolution  rules.  It  is  used  to\ndescribe the whole life cycle process from experiment design to arti-\nficial society operation, including the interaction and updating rules\nbetween agents, environments, agents and environments. These rules\ncan be either mappings of real social rules or hypothetical rules that\nare artificially assumed.\nIn traditional experiment design, the operating logic resembles the\ndeterministic function in mathematics. To be more specific, it treats\nthe experimental process as a transformation of multiple inputs (usu-\nally a combination) into one or more observable response variables.\nThe focus of traditional experimental design is on selecting an effec-\ntive subset from a vast space of possible values, using methods such\nas  orthogonal  design  and  Latin  hypercube  designs.  Nonetheless,\ncomplex systems like CPSS involve human and social factors, result-\ning  in  uncertain  value  space  and  making  it  difficult  to  select  effec-\ntive  subsets.  ChatGPT’s  operating  logic  is  not  based  on  classical\nfunctions  but  rather  resembles  probability  functions.  In  AI-assisted\ndesign,  samples  are  drawn  from  a  probability  distribution  centered\naround the expected result. This approach may lead to random biases\nand  inaccurate  results  but  significantly  improves  efficiency.  More-\nover, the “way of thinking” of AI is more divergent, making it more\nsuitable for designing uncertain experimental scenes in CPSS.\nComputational experiments for ChatGPT\nChatGPT  is  primarily  a  language  output  generation  system  that\nlearns patterns of content from various sources such as the web and\nbooks.  What's  remarkable  about  ChatGPT  is  its  ability  to  produce\nhuman-like  output  ranging  from  short  phrases  to  entire  chapters.\nWhile  ChatGPT  is  currently  adept  at  automating  human-like  cate-\ngory  events,  not  everything  useful  follows  a  human-like  pattern,\nespecially, particularly in complex systems. ChatGPT is still power-\nless in the face of uncertain events that occurred in complex systems.\nStill,  the  amount  of  data  available  for  some  major  emergencies  is\nalways insufficient. As we move forward, it is crucial to address the\nweaknesses  of  ChatGPT  to  further  improve  its  capabilities  [17].\nHence, the use of computational experiments is the optimal approach\nto aid ChatGPT in answering complex causality questions.\nAs shown in Fig. 4 , a symbiotic dynamic feedback system can be\nestablished between computational experiments and ChatGPT. Com-\nputational  experiments  accurately  describe  the  reasoning  challenges\nthat  ChatGPT  encounters  in  artificial  societies  and  consider  knowl-\nedge as a means of reconstructing interdependence in artificial sys-\ntems. Real-world issues can be abstracted into virtual space models,\nand  computational  experiments  can  be  conducted.  The  enormous\nsimulation  analysis  data  generated  can  be  utilized  as  the  dynamic\ninput  for  ChatGPT,  which  can  continually  update  its  model.\nChapGPT  can  continuously  optimize  and  revise  the  experiment\ndesign  under  the  guidance  of  users,  so  as  to  dig  out  deeper  causal\nrelationship,  and  provide “reference”,  “prediction”  and  “guidance”\nfor  dealing  with  possible  situations.

Its  primary  function  is  to  represent  the\nworld  and  does  not  involve  the  control  or  management  of  the  real\nworld.  In  this  regard,  computational  experiments  belong  to “target\nmodeling” or “target description”. Their function is to calculate the\nworld,  emphasizing  how  to  construct “scenarios”  in  which  events\noccur, develop, transform and evolve, and evaluate the effects of dif-\nferent coping strategies. They form a running process that integrates\nthe  behavior  model  and  the  goal  model,  which  can  improve  Chat-\nGPT’s complex reasoning ability in three aspects [19]: 1) Black-box\nanalysis  (What  happened):  This  involves  summarizing  and  sorting\nout  experimental  data  to  understand  the  changing  rules  between\ninfluencing  factors  and  response  variables.  2)  Behavior  analysis\n(How it happened): This involves describing the dynamic behavior of\nAgent and analyze the occurrence and development process of event\nchain.  3)  Mechanism  analysis  (why  it  happened):  This  involves\nobtaining the causality between the scenarios reflected in the evolu-\ntion of the event chain.  \nAcknowledgment\nThis work was supported in part by the National Key Research and\nDevelopment  Program  of  China  (2021YFF0900800),  the  National\nNatural  Science  Foundation  of  China  (61972276,  62206116,\n62032016),  Open  Research  Fund  of  The  State  Key  Laboratory  for\nManagement  and  Control  of  Complex  Systems  (20210101),  New\nLiberal  Arts  Reform  and  Practice  Project  of  National  Ministry  of\nEducation  (2021170002),  and  Tianjin  University  Talent  Innovation\nReward  Program  for  Literature  &  Science  Graduate  Student  (C1-\n2022-010).\nReferences\n F.-Y.
