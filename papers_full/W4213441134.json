Although many studies corroborate that moderate\nphysical activity and proper nutrition help to maintain a healthy\nbody [1] and mind [2], a large part of society continues to place\nmore importance on physical appearance than on health. In\nrecent years, trends have promoted a curvy physique [3,4]\ndespite it being unhealthy, and most people associate having a\nslim body with being happy to have a slim body. These\nassociations between physical appearance and happiness are\nthe causes of illnesses such as eating disorders. These mental\nillnesses are complex and do not depend on a single factor [5,6].\nThus, messages relating being fat or skinny with aesthetics that\nare contained in some media—advertisements, magazines, and\ncelebrity social media—can hurt people vulnerable to these\ntypes of illnesses.\nThe prevalence of eating disorders has been increasing [7]. In\naddition, since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has\nbeen a more pronounced increase in eating disorders [7].\nTherefore, any strategy that helps to combat this health problem\nmay be of interest to society.\nWith the emergence of social media, studies [8-12] using social\nmedia data to propose solutions that can help combat this type\nof illness from different perspectives have also emerged.\nArtificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, mainly\napplied to text, have been used to find patterns that help in\nclassifying text to explore eating disorder–related discourse\nshared on Twitter [8,9] and other studies [10-12] are making\nuse of the data contained in social networks and offering\nsolutions that can help in the field of public health. Among the\nsocial media currently available, the most widely used platform\nin scientific studies is Twitter [13].\nDespite the increase in studies on eating disorders that have,\nfor example, analyzed pro–eating disorder websites [14],\nperformed sentiment analysis of pro–anorexia and\nantiproanorexia videos on YouTube [15], and that have used\nsocial media data and artificial intelligence techniques on\npro–eating disorder and prorecovery text [16], none has\nidentified (1) tweets that have been written by people who suffer\nor have suffered from eating disorders, (2) tweets that promote\neating disorders, (3) informative or noninformative tweets\nrelated to eating disorders and, within the informative tweets,\n(4) which ones make use of scientific information and which\nones do not.\nObjectives\nOur main objectives were to achieve accurate text classification\nin performing these 4 tasks, to compare the efficiency of text\nclassification models using traditional machine learning\ntechniques and those using novel techniques, such as pretrained\nbidirectional encoder representations from transformer\n(BERT)–based models, to determine which approach has the\nbest combination of performance and computational cost and\nwould be useful for future research.\nIn our previous research [17], in which 6 test-beds were\nconducted, the main objective was only to apply 6 pretrained\nbidirectional encoder representations from transformer–based\nmodels to classify a category in a data set. This time, we used\na broader approach, by presenting the main problem as a\ncomparison of the performance (accuracy and computational\ncost) of traditional machine learning models vs bidirectional\nencoder representations from transformer–based models on 4\ndifferent data categorization tasks. This meant increasing 6\ntest-beds to 40 different test-beds.\nLiterature Review\nSocial Media in Health Informatics\nSocial media, specifically social networks, have become very\nimportant sources of information within the field of health\ninformatics. Health informatics includes the design and\napplication of innovations based on information technologies\nto solve problems related to public health and health services\n[18]. In this branch of interdisciplinary science, it is possible to\ncarry out complex research to manage information to improve\nefficiency and reduce costs in health care [19]. Health\ninformatics includes information science, informatics, and health\ncare.\nHealth-related research using social media is mainly focused\non two areas. In real-time monitoring and the prediction of\ndiseases (eg, influenza), it is possible to collect and use messages\nthat have been geographically localized and that are on topics\nof interest. In this way, research tasks related to the user\ndiscussions are a simple task. Social media are also used to\ndetermine perspectives on different health problems and\nconditions. Thus, social media are useful, easy to use, and very\nimportant tools for observational studies.\nTwitter is a very popular and widely used social network within\nthe field of health and social health research. Some studies\n[9,14-16] make use of artificial intelligence techniques, such as\nsocial network data mining, to generate predictive models based\non current knowledge. These techniques have been used, for\nexample, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, to\ndetermine the public’s perceptions [20] and to examine\ncommunication behavior between health organizations and users\n[21].\nStudies [8,9,17,22-24] in the field of health informatics have\nused Twitter to study user behaviors and characteristics such\nas location, frequency, most used hashtags, or the structure of\nuser networks. This information, being public and anonymous,\nis typically exempt from requiring the approval of an ethics\ncommittee [25]. Other studies have analyzed the impact of\ncontent shared by users [21] and how Twitter is used to receive\nand provide emotional support [26] or to determine the best\nway raise public awareness (World Rare Disease Day [27]).\nSocial media facilitate a great deal of research in the field of\nhealth informatics, for example, sentiment analysis, behavioral\nanalysis, or information dissemination analysis, which make\nuse of techniques related to machine learning or deep learning\ntechniques for the classification and prediction of content that\nhas been prepared using natural language processing.\nJMIR Med Inform 2022 | vol. 10 | iss. 2 | e34492 | p. 2https://medinform.jmir.org/2022/2/e34492\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBenítez-Andrades et alJMIR MEDICAL INFORMATICS\nXSL•FO\nRenderX\nClassification Methods and Health Informatics\nSupervised machine learning techniques are used to predict an\noutcome based on a given input by constructing an input–output\npair. The main goal is to build a model that can then be used to\nmake accurate predictions using new data.\nTasks in the field of supervised machine learning include\nregression—the prediction of a real number—and\nclassification—the prediction of a class label [28]. Supervised\nclassification tasks make use of a labeled training data set. This\nset allows the creation of classifiers or predictive models [28].\nText mining techniques are used to quantify text data (what is\nfeature engineering) to represent the relationships between words\nas tokens.\nClassification techniques make it possible to categorize large\ndata sets efficiently to study text-based data. This approach has\nmany advantages—more accurate predictions than those of\nhumans and time savings [29-31]. Some commonly used\nclassification techniques in health informatics are logistic\nregression, support vector machines, Naïve Bayes, random\nforest, gradient boosting trees, decision trees, and gradient\nboosted regression trees.\nNaïve Bayes classifiers have been used to predict Zika and\ndengue diseases using data obtained from Twitter [32] and to\ntest the classification of 4 conditions—influenza, depression,\npregnancy, and eating disorders—and 2 locations—Portugal\nand Spain [33].\nOther studies [34-36] have shown that good results can be\nobtained using support vector machine algorithms, such as, with\na neural network to predict COVID-19 in chest x-ray images,\na prediction model [35], and for sentiment analysis tasks on a\nTwitter data set related to the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada\n[36]. A gradient boosted regression tree classifier was used to\nidentify tweets related to e-cigarettes [22], with accurate\nclassification of 5 different user types, by manually labeling a\nsample of tweets and using feature engineering techniques based\non the term frequency–inverse document frequency matrix.\nIt is also possible to combine different classification algorithms\nand compare their performance to use the best performing\nclassifier for a given task [37], for example, gradient boosting\ntree, decision tree, logistic regression, and support vector\nmachine models were used to predict patient needs at the level\nof informational support [23].\nSocial Media Research Related to Eating Disorders\nThere are a number of studies that make use of data related to\neating disorders [8,14-16,24,38]. In one study [24], 123,977\ntweets were collected and a subsample of 2219 was labeled; the\nefficiency of a convolutional neural network, with long\nshort-term memory, in classifying tweets about eating disorders\nwas demonstrated. Another study [8] statistically analyzed the\neffect of eating disorder awareness campaigns by obtaining\ninformation on tweets that mentioned 2 hashtags. A review [39]\nshowed the importance of machine learning in advancing the\nprediction, prevention, and treatment of mental illness and eating\ndisorders. Other studies [14-16,38] have demonstrated the\nimportance of the use of data obtained from social networks in\nthe field of eating disorders, by performing analysis from a\nsocial rather than computational perspective, which is known\nas social network analysis.\nA previous social media study predicted depression from texts\n[40]; therefore, detecting texts written by people suffering from\neating disorders can also be helpful. Studies on the detection of\npro-ana and pro-recovery communities [41-43]—people in favor\nof and who promote anorexia and recovery from eating\ndisorders, respectively—and reviews [44,45], have suggested\nthis type of study may be useful. Furthermore, to the best of our\nknowledge, no studies having the same objectives as ours have\nbeen conducted.\nMethods\nData Collection\nTweets\nA tool (T-Hoarder [46]) was used to collect tweets (Figure 1).\nTweets were obtained at the moment they were sent because\nthe tool uses the Twitter streaming API, thus tweets that were\nsubsequently removed from the platform for not complying\nwith regulations were still obtained.\nT-Hoarder allowed us to obtain additional information about\ntweets for further analysis, such as, ID, text, and author (among\nother fields). Tweets were identified by keywords [17]. In set\n1 “anorexia,” “anorexic,” “dietary disorders,” “inappetence,”\n“feeding disorder,” “food problem,” “binge eating,” and\n“anorectic” we used. In set 2, “eating disorders,” “bulimia,”\n“food issues,” “loss of appetite,” “food issue,” “food hater,”\n“eat healthier,” “disturbed eating habits,” “abnormal eating\nhabits,” and “abnormal eating habit” were used. In set 3,\n“binge-vomit syndrome,” “bingeing,” “bulimarexia,” “anorexic\nskinny,” and “eating healthy” were used.\nBy using a different Twitter accounts for each set, more tweets\ncould be obtained without exceeding the Twitter platform's\nusage limit. English terms were used because more tweets are\ngenerated in English [46].\nJMIR Med Inform 2022 | vol. 10 | iss. 2 | e34492 | p. 3https://medinform.jmir.org/2022/2/e34492\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBenítez-Andrades et alJMIR MEDICAL INFORMATICS\nXSL•FO\nRenderX\nFigure 1. Study workflow: (A) data collection and preprocessing, (B) classification model training, and (C) evaluation. BERT: bidirectional encoder\nrepresentations from transformer, ML: machine learning.\nPreprocessing\nPreprocessing was conducted in Python (version 3.6). Data were\nloaded from documents obtained through T-Hoarder, which\ngenerates a file up to 100 MB; therefore, 4 files were obtained\nfor data set 1, 4 files were obtained for data set 2, and 2 files\nwere obtained for data set 3. Some data, such as location, name,\nand biography, contained line breaks or tabs. To avoid conflicts\nwith delimiters, tabs and line breaks were removed using a\nfunction. After preprocessing the data frames, they were\nconcatenated into a single data frame. In order to be able to\nwork in a more agile way with the data frame, the memory usage\nof the data frame was calculated and optimized by converting\nnumeric columns into numbers, converting dates to datetime\nformat, and converting the remaining objects into categories.\nThese steps helped reduce the data frame from 2.7 GB to 1.1\nGB. We removed all tweets that were retweets, duplicates\n(because we unified data sets that might contain common\ntweets), and non–English tweets.\nTo select the subset of 2000 tweets, manual filtering was\nperformed to eliminate tweets that were not related to eating\ndisorder issues. Some of our keywords were too generic and\nmeant that the tweets collected were not about eating disorders.\nFor example, some of these words that triggered the collection\nof tweets unrelated to eating disorders were “food problem,”\n“inappetence,” “food issue,” and “bingeing”; however, in order\nto generate predictive models with greater accuracy and less\nbias, we kept a small sample of tweets (n=286) that did not\nbelong to any of the categories, but that did contain some of the\nkeywords of interest.\nLabeling\nTweets in 4 different categories in the subset were manually\nlabeled (Table 1). Labeling was carried out by 2 people, labeling\n1000 tweets each. The labels were then reviewed by 4 mental\nillness experts. This procedure took place over the course of 1\nfull month, with each person taking approximately a total of 70\nhours in carrying out this work. In category 1, tweets written\nby people suffering from eating disorders were represented with\na value of 1, and the rest were represented with a value of 0. To\nassess this, each user profile was accessed and user description\nand tweets published by the user were examined to determine\nif the user had publicly mentioned having an eating disorder.\nIn category 2, tweets that promoted having an eating disorder\nwere labeled with a value of 1, and all other tweets were labeled\nwith a value of 0. There are communities of people who suffer\nfrom eating disorders who try to encourage other people to also\nsuffer from it by promoting it as if it were something positive\nor fashionable. There are many studies [9] that talk about\npro–eating disorders communities using the terms pro-ana or\npro-anorexia. In category 3, informative tweets were represented\nwith a value of 1, and noninformative tweets were represented\nwith a value of 0. Informative tweets are those that show\ninformation with the aim of informing readers, while the rest\nwere those in which the author expressed an opinion. In category\n4, scientific tweets were labeled with a value of 1, and the rest\nwere labeled with a value of 0. A tweet of an informative nature\nthat had been written by a person belonging to the field of\nresearch, for example, a doctor of philosophy in different\nsubjects, was labeled as a scientific tweet. Scientific tweets were\nalso those that shared links to papers published in scientific\njournals. If a tweet did not belong to any of the 4 proposed\ncategories, it was not eliminated from the data set, since having\ntweets with value of 0 was also necessary.\nJMIR Med Inform 2022 | vol. 10 | iss. 2 | e34492 | p. 4https://medinform.jmir.org/2022/2/e34492\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBenítez-Andrades et alJMIR MEDICAL INFORMATICS\nXSL•FO\nRenderX\nTable 1.

It was\ndecided to apply this criterion for tweets containing the same\ntext but using different hashtags. Remaining tweets were\nprocessed by removing the stop words (words that have no\nmeaning on their own and that modify or accompany other\nwords, for example, articles, pronouns, adverbs, prepositions,\nor some verbs) and punctuation or symbols, that hindered the\napplication of machine learning techniques.\nClassification Methods\nGeneral\nWe used random forest, recurrent neural networks, bidirectional\nlong short-term memory networks (ClassificationModel;\nsimpletransformers [47], version 0.62.2), and pretrained\nbidirectional encoder representations from transformer–based\nmodels (RoBERTa [48], BERT [49], CamemBERT [50],\nDistilBERT [51], FlauBERT [52], ALBERT [53], and\nRobBERT [54]). Bidirectional long short-term memory and\nbidirectional encoder representations from transformer–based\nmethods were chosen because they seemed to be the most\npromising models for natural language processing [55-57]. In\naddition, random forest was used for comparison because it is\na traditional machine learning technique.\nTwo models—CamemBERT [50] and FlauBERT [52]—were\npretrained using French text, and RobBERT [54] was pretrained\nusing Dutch text. We used these models to obtain performance\ndata for with text not written in their initial language. Data were\ndivided into 70% training and 30% testing sets (train_test_split\nfunction in scikit-learn). The evaluation metrics were accuracy\nand F1 score.\nFor the random forest model, 5-fold cross-validation was used.\nFor the neural networks, 5 different iterations were performed,\nand the mean F1 score and accuracy were obtained.\nRandom Forest\nRandom forest models [58] are constructed from a set of\ndecision trees, which are usually trained with a method called\nbagging, to take advantage of the independence between the\nsimple algorithms, since error can be greatly reduced by\naveraging the outputs of the simple models. Several decision\ntrees are built and fused in order to obtain a more stable and\naccurate prediction. Random forest models can be used for both\nregression and classification problems.\nOne of the advantages offered by this type of model is the\nadditional randomness when more trees are included. The\nalgorithm searches for the best feature as a node is split from a\nrandom set of features. This makes it possible to obtain models\nwith better performance. When a node is split, only a random\nsubset of features is considered. Random thresholds can also\nbe used for each feature, instead of searching for the best\npossible threshold, which adds additional randomness.\nRecurrent Neural Network\nIn this type of neural network, a temporal sequence that contains\na directed graph made up of connections between different nodes\nJMIR Med Inform 2022 | vol. 10 | iss. 2 | e34492 | p. 5https://medinform.jmir.org/2022/2/e34492\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBenítez-Andrades et alJMIR MEDICAL INFORMATICS\nXSL•FO\nRenderX\nis defined. These networks have the capacity to show a dynamic\ntemporal behavior. These types of networks, which are derived\nfrom feedforward neural networks, have the ability to use\nmemory (their internal state) to process input sequences of\nvarying lengths. This feature makes recurrent neural networks\nuseful for tasks such as unsegmented and connected handwriting\nrecognition or speech recognition [55,59,60].\nThere are 2 classes of recurrent neural networks—finite-pulse\nand infinite-pulse. The former are made up of a directed acyclic\ngraph that can be unrolled and replaced by a strictly feedforward\nneural network, whereas the latter are made of a directed cyclic\ngraph, which does not allow the graph from being unrolled.\nBidirectional Long Short-Term Memory\nBidirectional long short-term memory networks [61] are\nconstructed from 2 long short-term memory modules that, at\neach time step, take past and future states into account to\nproduce the output.\nBidirectional Encoder Representations From\nTransformer–Based Models\nThe bidirectional encoder representations from transformer\nframework is not a model in itself. According to Devlin et al\n[49], it is a “language understanding” model.\nIn the bidirectional encoder representations from\ntransformer–based method, a neural network is trained to learn\na language, similar to transfer learning in computer vision neural\nnetworks, and follows the linguistic representation in a\nbidirectional way, looking at the words both after and before\neach words. It is the combination of these approaches that has\nmade it a successful natural language processing method [62].\nConfiguration\nWe used Jupyter notebook and TensorFlow and Pytorch\nlibraries. It was necessary to use both libraries because,\ncurrently, bidirectional encoder representations from\ntransformer–based networks can only be generated through\nPytorch, while TensorFlow is one of the most widely used\nlibraries to generate random forest, recurrent neural network,\nand bidirectional long short-term memory models.\nHyperparameters\nWe used a grid search (GridSearchCV) to select the random\nforest parameters (Table 2).\nTo train recurrent neural networks (sklearn; keras) to perform\nthe binary categorization tasks, the sigmoid activation function\nused (Figure 2). We trained and validated the bidirectional long\nshort-term memory models (sklearn and TensorFlow libraries)\nusing the best-performing configuration (Figure 3), after\ncarrying out different tests.\nFor the 7 pretrained bidirectional encoder representations from\ntransformer–based models, the hyperparameters were\nreprocess_input_data=True; fp16=False; evaluate_during_training=False;\nevaluate_during_training_verbose=False; learning_rate=2e-5;\ntr ain_batc h_size =32;  e val_batc h_size =32;\nnum_train_epochs=15; overwrite_output_dir=True; and\nevaluation_strategy='epochs'.\nAll experiments and data are published in a repository accessible\nto anyone [63].\nTable 2.

Although the model\nwith the best accuracy was always one of the pretrained\nbidirectional encoder representations from transformer–based\nmodels, the computational costs compared with those of simpler\nmodels may be excessive. The difference between the accuracy\nof the best bidirectional encoder representations from\ntransformer–based model and the best of the 3 simpler models\n(random forest, recurrent neural network, and bidirectional long\nshort-term memory) did not exceed 9.79%.\nGiven the high computational cost, use of bidirectional encoder\nrepresentations from transformer–based models in this instance\nmay not be essential. The accuracy for the 4 different\ncategorization tasks is relatively high even in the simplest\nmodels.\nDespite the fact that we used only 1877 tweets (which is similar\nto the amounts used in previous studies: 2219 [24] and 2095\n[65]), the models classified the tweets with a high level of\naccuracy.\nFor the classification of tweets into informative or\nnoninformative (categorization 3), our models obtained a higher\naccuracy (80%-84.4%) than those in previous studies (77.7%\n[44] and 81% [45]). Comparisons cannot be made for the other\n3 categorization tasks because of a lack pf applicable eating\ndisorder–related studies.\nLimitations\nThis research has several limitations. (1) It was limited to a\nsocial media platform, (2) some categorization tasks were not\nbalanced, which may lead to bias in the generated models, (3)\nthe training set was sufficient but could be larger for better\nresults in a real environment, and (4) when labeling tweets, it\nis possible that there was a bias in determining whether a tweet\nwas written by someone with an eating disorder due to lack of\ninformation about the user.\nConclusions\nMachine learning and deep learning models were used to classify\neating disorder–related tweets into binary categories in 4\ncategorization tasks, with accuracies greater than 80%. The best\nperforming models were RoBERTa and DistilBERT, both\nbidirectional encoder representations from transformer–based\nclassification methods.\nThe computational cost was much higher for the bidirectional\nencoder representations from transformer–based models\ncompared to those of the simpler models (random forest,\nrecurrent neural network or traditional bidirectional long\nshort-term memory), time invested in training and validation\nwas greater by a factor of 10.\nFuture work will include (1) increasing the training and\nvalidation data set, (2) applying natural language processing\ntechniques that make use of ontologies with which it is possible\nto include automation and logical reasoning, (3) integrating\npredictive models in a real-world development project, such as\na Twitter bot, and (4) validating the model using texts written\nby patients with eating disorders and who are in treatment.\nConflicts of Interest\nNone declared.\nReferences\n1.
