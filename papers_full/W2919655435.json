INTRODUCTION\nThe communication networks in IEC61850-based substation\nare indispensable for the application of substation automation\nsystem (SAS). Since the protection and control schemes in\nsmart substation is realized by networks, the key constraint\nof protective functions turns to be the delivery timeliness\nand transmission reliability [1]–[3]. At present, the process\nbus of Ethernet undertakes transmitting raw data messages\nrepresented as sampled value (SV) message and tripping\ncommands represented as generic object-oriented substation\nevent (GOOSE) message. The SV message carries short peri-\nodic sampled values of voltage and current, resulting in large\nnetwork trafﬁc. The GOOSE message adopts retransmission\nmechanism to improve reliability [4].\nData transmission quality problems need to be addressed,\nwhich are mainly reﬂected as packet loss, time delay, bit error,\ndisorder, and even temporary loss of link in message trans-\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Dongbo Zhao.\nmission [5]–[7]. Interpolation technique is a simple and prac-\ntical measure to solve such issues. There exist many kinds of\ninterpolation algorithms, such as linear interpolation, second-\norder Lagrange interpolation, cubic spline interpolation and\nso on. Linear interpolation is more commonly used because\nof its simplicity, small computation, and rapidity, while the\nothers do better in precision with more calculation and time\nconsumption. Apparently, better calculation precision usually\nmeans more computing workloads and slower computing\nspeed. Therefore, before determining an appropriate interpo-\nlation algorithm, it is necessary to consider which is more\nimportant between precision and speed.\nSV and GOOSE messages are time critical and may be\nlost/delayed due to burst trafﬁc and insufﬁcient network\nbandwidth, which will affect the relay functions. Therefore,\nthey are tagged with higher priority and directly mapping\nto low-level Ethernet layer [8], [9]. Unlike GOOSE mes-\nsage, SV message is not transmitted repeatedly. Therefore,\nmore attention should be paid to SV packet loss/delay\nissues, especially for differential protection that needs\n55698\n2169-3536 \n 2019 IEEE.

Heet al.: Performance Analysis and Threshold Quantization of Transformer Differential Protection\nsynchronization of sampled values on both sides. Blocking\nthe protection equipment is a common countermeasure for\nexcessive packets losss/delay, but it might deteriorate the\nsystem if backup protection fails to work during a fault.\nReferences [10] and [11] have stated several scenarios of\nSV loss/delay considering various communication parame-\nters, adopted a corrective measure, and further studied the\npossible impact of SV loss/delay on bus bar and distance relay\nprotection.\nIt can be easily seen that the transmission quality of SV\nmessage is closely related to the realization of protection\nfunctions. In this paper, the phasor method is ﬁrstly raised to\nexplore the operation characteristics of differential protection\nin the case of SV packet loss/delay. Further, the boundary\nthresholds of transformer differential protection are searched\nout by simulating. The mal-operation and miss operation\nof the relaying are judged when different corrective mea-\nsures are used in response to SV packet loss/delay under\ndifferent scenarios. Moreover, two indices are put forward to\nweigh the performance of corrective measures. These would\nhelp the operators and designers form an intuitive and clear\nunderstanding of the protective failure caused by SV packet\nloss/delay in smart substation.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows.\nIn Section II, the phasor relationship of currents between two\nterminals is employed to analyze the operation characteristics\nof differential protection when the packet loss occurs to one of\nthe terminals. Section III builds up the simulation model with\nPSCAD/EMTDC and realizes data processing of transformer\ndifferential protection with MATLAB. Section IV introduces\nfour kinds of estimation algorithms to deal with the scenar-\nios including SV single packet loss as well as consecutive\npackets loss and discusses the performance of interpolation\nunder normal operation. Section V puts forward two met-\nrics, BtPL (boundary to packet loss) and TtPL (tolerance to\npacket loss, %), in order to measure the tolerance threshold\nof differential protection to packet loss, and also analyzes\nmal-operation when external faults happen. The inﬂuence of\nequipment capacity, fault type, starting point on wave, and\nsampling frequency is studied in detail. Section VI further\nanalyzes the miss operation during internal faults. Section VII\nconcludes the paper.\nII. OPERATION CHARACTERISTIC ANALYSIS OF\nDIFFERENTIAL PROTECTION\nIn order to ensure the selectivity and sensitivity of pro-\ntection, the transformer differential protection universally\nadopts through-current restrained characteristics. Use ˙Im and\n˙In to indicate the secondary currents at both ends of the\ntwo-winding transformer respectively. Thus, the differen-\ntial current is Id =\n⏐⏐˙Im +˙In\n⏐⏐. The restraint current is\nIr =1\n2\n⏐⏐˙Im −˙In\n⏐⏐. The action criterion of differential protec-\ntion applies the ideal ratio-restrained characteristics shown\nin Fig. 1. It can be expressed as\nId ≥Iact.min, Ir <Ires.min\nId ≥KIr , Ir ≥Ires.min\n}\n(1)\nFIGURE 1. Simplified two-section line ratio-restrained characteristic.\nAssuming that ˙Im and ˙In are strictly sinusoidal, phasor\nexpression can be used to study the operation characteristics\nof differential protection [12], [13]. Suppose that ˙Im has the\nlarger amplitude than ˙In and take ˙Im as a reference value for\nnormalization. Therefore, expression ˙P =˙In/˙Pn ˙Im ˙Im can be\nobtained. Then, the relationship between the currents on both\nsides can be represented by a unit circle based on ˙Im. The ﬁrst\npart of criterion (1), ratio section, can be written as\n⏐⏐p1 +˙P\n⏐⏐ ≥Iact.min\nIm\n(2)\nThe operation characteristics related to formula (2) are\npresented in Fig. 2(a). The center vector of the setting circle is\n1ej180◦\nand the radius is equal to Iact.min/Im. When the relative\nvalue of ˙In falls within the setting circle, the relay protection\ndoes not act, but it would operate if ˙P locates in the shadow.\nSimilarly, the second part of criterion (1), restrained section,\ncan be written as\n⏐⏐1 +˙P\n⏐⏐ ≥K\n2\n⏐⏐1 −˙P\n⏐⏐ (3)\nThe operation characteristics related to formula (3) are\npresented in Fig. 2(b). ˙Qo, the center vector of the restrained\ncircle is 4+K2\n4−K2 ej180◦\n. The radius of the restrained circle is\ndescribed as 4K\n4−K2 . The action domain comprises the shaded\narea inside the unit circle but outside the restrained one.\nFIGURE 2. Operation characteristics of differential protection. (a) Ratio\nsection. (b) Restrained section.\nAssume that several SV packets on the n side are lost and\nthe current measurement is represented as γ˙In = αejβ˙In,\nwhere α represents the amplitude error and β stands for\nthe phase angle error. Then, the operation characteristic of\ndifferential protection can be written as\n⏐⏐1 +γ˙P\n⏐⏐ ≥Iact.min\nIm\n(4)\n⏐⏐1 +γ˙P\n⏐⏐ ≥K\n2\n⏐⏐1 −γ˙P\n⏐⏐ (5)\nVOLUME 7, 2019 55699\nR. Heet al.: Performance Analysis and Threshold Quantization of Transformer Differential Protection\nFIGURE 3. Operation characteristics of differential protection after\nSV packet loss. (a) Ratio section. (b) Restrained section.\nThe modiﬁed operation characteristic is shown in Fig. 3.\nThe measurement error caused by SV packet loss makes the\ncenter vector of the setting circle shift to 1\nαej(180◦−β) and the\nradius becomes Iact.min\nαIm . Accordingly, ˙Qr, the center vector of\nthe restrained circle, turns to be 1\nγ ˙Qo and the radius becomes\n4K\nα(4−K2) . The circles shown in Fig. 3 are under the conditions\nof α < 1 and β > 0. In fact, under the inﬂuence of\nvarious factors, the amplitude of the measured current may\nincrease or decrease and the phase may either lead or lag due\nto SV packet loss. Even if it is not an ideal two-section line\ncharacteristic, it is difﬁcult to use the phasor relationship for\nqualitative analysis. As a result, a stochastic mal-operation\nmay occur to the differential protection in the case of an\nexternal fault.\nIII. PROTECTION SCHEME AND SIMULATION MODEL\nA. SYSTEM MODEL\nThe protection scheme in smart substations discussed\ninvolves merging units (MUs), process bus, Ethernet\nswitches, digital protective relays, and intelligent terminals\nof breakers. Transmission frameworks for SV and GOOSE\nmessage have been deﬁned in IEC 61850 and each of them\ncarries data vital to protection system. To be speciﬁc, SV\nmessage is a kind of cyclical messages concerning voltage\nand current measured by potential transformers (PTs) and\ncurrent transformers (CTs) in primary system. Then, they\nare converted into digital data by merging units. GOOSE\nmessage is mainly the tripping signal sent by protective\nrelays to intelligent terminals. The amount of SV packets is\nmuch larger than that of GOOSE packets, taking up major\ntrafﬁc in process bus. Moreover, SV packet is likely to be\nlost or delayed in network congestion, which may leads to\nthe failure of protection function.\nIn order to study the inﬂuence of SV packet loss/delay on\nrelay protection action, a primary system model consisted of\na generator, a transformer, a transmission line, and an inﬁ-\nnite system is established with PSCAD/EMTDC. With this\nmodel, the possibility of mal-operation and miss operation\nfor transformer differential protection is investigated during\nexternal and internal faults when SV packet loss/delay occurs\nin various scenarios. Moreover, the tolerance degree to SV\npacket loss/delay is discussed.\nIt can be seen from the model shown in Fig. 4 that the\ngenerator terminal voltage is 13.8kV , the inﬁnite system\nvoltage is 220kV and the system frequency is 50Hz. The\n4 points (F1, F2, F3, and F4) are set to represent external\nand internal faults occurring on the low-voltage side and the\nhigh-voltage side. The CTs on both sides collect the current\nof each phase from the circuit breaker B1 and B2. The initial\nsampling frequency is set to 4 kHz, that is, 80 current values\nare collected per cycle. Magnetic saturation and harmonics\nare not considered in this model.\nB. PROCEDURE OF DATA PROCESSING\nVarious typical faults are set in the PSCAD/EMTDC and then\nthe three-phase current data acquired by the CT are imported\ninto MATLAB. Speciﬁc processing procedure is presented\nin Fig. 5.\nThe current measurements are packaged according to the\nIEC61850 standard and pushed into a buffer. Set the loca-\ntion of the lost SV packet and the number of consecutive\nlost packets. Then, the sampled value of the lost packet is\nestimated by means of corrective measures and stored in the\ncorresponding position. Next, the current RMS is obtained\nby the Fourier algorithm. Meanwhile, the differential current\nId and the restraint current Ir of the transformer differential\nprotection are ﬁgured out as well. Conventional two-section\nline ratio-restrained characteristic is adopted as the action\ncriterion of the differential protection. The critical points of\nthe action can be searched out by changing the location and\nnumber of the lost SV packets.\nIV. ESTIMATION ALGORITHMS FOR SV PACKET LOSS\nSupposing that SV packet is lost at the moment tn dur-\ning the transmission [7], three scenarios are demonstrated\nin Fig. 6. Scenario (a): no packet arrives after tn; Scenario (b):\nthe packet at tn+1 is the only available data after tn;\nScenario (c): both packets at tn+1 and tn+2 have arrived. That\nis to say, Scenario (b) or (c) indicates that a single packet\nloss occurs and Scenario (a) indicates consecutive loss of\npackets.\nIn this paper, four different corrective measures are used\nto handle packet loss. They are zero-value replacement, lin-\near interpolation, second-order Lagrange interpolation, and\nimproved linear interpolation. After considering the accuracy\nand speed together as a whole, the cubic spline interpolation is\nnot used. The coping strategy can also be applied to SV packet\ndelay before the actual delayed packets arrive and replace the\ndata stored in the buffer.\nMeasure 1. Substitute with zero for all lost SV packets.\nMeasure 2. Replace the lost packet with estimative\nvalue calculated by linear interpolation algorithm. Only\nScenario (a) and (b) need to be considered here, because the\nestimate value for Scenario (b) can be applied to Scenario (c)\nas well. The corresponding estimate value for Scenario (a)\ncan be written as\nin =2in−1 −in−2 (6)\n55700 VOLUME 7, 2019\nR.

Processing of sampled values in MATLAB.\nFIGURE 6. Sampled values for SV estimation technique: Scenario (a): next\nsamples are not available. Scenario (b): only one next sample is available.\nScenario (c): two next samples are available.\nThe estimate value for Scenario (b) and (c) is given by\nin =0.5in−1 −0.5in+1 (7)\nMeasure 3. Replace the value in the lost packet with\nthe value calculated by second-order Lagrange interpolation\nalgorithm. The interpolation formulas for the three kinds of\nscenarios above are as follows\nin =in−3 −3in−2 +3in−1 (8)\nin =(−in−2 +3in−1 +in+1)\n/\n3 (9)\nin =(in−1 +3in+1 −in+2)\n/\n3 (10)\nEquations (8), (9), and (10) are applicable for Scenario (a),\n(b), and (c), respectively.\nMeasure 4. According to the sinusoidal characteristics of\npower system parameters, an improved linear interpolation\nalgorithm is introduced to estimate the lost data.\nin =2\n(\ncos 2π\nN\n)\nin−1 −in−2 (11)\nin = in−1 +in+1\ncos\n(\n2π\n/\nN\n) (12)\nwhere N is the number of sampling values per cycle.\nEquation (11) is suitable for Scenario (a) and equation (11)\ncan be used in Scenario (b) and (c).\nNext, the accuracy of linear interpolation, second-order\nLagrange interpolation, and improved linear interpolation\nalgorithm when packet loss occurs under normal condition\nis put into research. The estimation errors of the three algo-\nrithms for single packet loss are all very small. When consec-\nutive packets loss occurs, the error of the algorithms greatly\nincreases, which may cause mal-operation of the differential\nprotection.\nFIGURE 7. Algorithm comparison for consecutive loss of 20 packets.\nAssuming that the steady-state current is sinusoidal,\nthe three interpolation results can be derived as in Fig. 7 when\n20 packets are lost continuously. Apparently, the estimation\nerror of linear interpolation and Lagrange interpolation gets\nbigger as the time goes on, while the estimation error of\nimproved linear interpolation remains tiny. In fact, as shown\nin Figure 8, even if all 80 samples are lost in one cycle,\nVOLUME 7, 2019 55701\nR.

Performance of improved linear interpolation coping with\nconsecutive 80 packets loss.\nthe improved linear interpolation can be used to estimate the\nlost packets with a maximum relative error of only 0.15%.\nThe outstanding estimation accuracy of this algorithm is\nmainly due to its interpolation theory based on a sinusoidal\nwaveform, which is the same as the steady-state current.\nV. MAL-OPERATION ANALYSIS OF TRANSFORMER\nDIFFERENTIAL PROTECTION DURING\nEXTERNAL FAULT\nThis section studies the mal-operation boundaries of trans-\nformer differential protection caused by SV packet loss /delay\nduring external faults. The single-phase-to-earth fault appears\nat F4 to simulate external fault on high-voltage side of trans-\nformer. First, Measure 1 to 4 are used to estimate the lost SV\nvalue collected by CT at location B1. Second, the differential\ncurrent Id and the restraint current Ir of the protection are\nﬁgured out with Fourier algorithm after replacing the missing\ndata with the estimated values. Finally, the minimum number\nof consecutive lost packets causing protection mal-operation\nis obtained according to the ratio-restrained characteristic.\nTo begin with, two metrics, BtPL and TtPL, are deﬁned to\nmeasure the tolerance level of SV packet loss for protection.\nBtPL means the minimum number of consecutive SV packets\nloss causing the protection mal-operation in a certain time\nperiod. TtPL is deﬁned as the ratio of the number of packets\nallowed to be consecutively lost in a cycle period to the total\nnumber of packets per cycle.\nThree factors are considered during the analysis, including:\n1) electrical equipment capacity, 2) fault types and point on\nwave (POW), and 3) Sampling frequency. To study the impact\nof each parameter separately, one of the parameter has been\nvaried within the available range, while keeping the other\nparameters to their nominal values.\nA. CHANGING ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT CAPACITY\nThe results of BtPL can be obtained by changing the capac-\nity of generator and/or transformer as shown in Table 1.\nParticularly, if all the packets in a cycle are lost without mal-\noperation on protection, it is deemed that protection mal-\noperation would never occur, which is marked as NVR.\nAs shown in Table 1, conventional zero-ﬁlling strategy\nwould deﬁnitely bring about large estimation errors, result-\ning in a smallest BtPL. On the contrary, interpolation algo-\nrithm can greatly eliminate the inﬂuence of SV packet loss,\nleading to sufﬁcient improvement of the thresholds. The\n55702 VOLUME 7, 2019\nR. Heet al.: Performance Analysis and Threshold Quantization of Transformer Differential Protection\ntrends under different working conditions are similar to one\nanother. In other word, pre-fault BtPL is the largest, while\nthe BtPL during the earlier period of the fault is the smallest.\nAdditionally, post-fault BtPL increases as time goes on. It is\nnot hard to explain these ﬁndings. Generally, pre-fault cur-\nrent is relatively small and has a good sinusoidal waveform,\nso the estimation errors are relatively tiny. The waveform is\ndistorted at the early stage of the fault, where the current just\nmutates and there exists an attenuated direct current. If packet\nloss occurs at this moment, the estimation may use both the\nsampled data before and after the fault, leading to a large\nestimation error and a smaller BtPL. As time goes on, the DC\ncomponent gradually decays and the current tends to steady\nvalue. Hence, the BtPL increases again.\nFIGURE 9. Comparison between the estimated and true value of the\nLagrange interpolation under packet loss.\nThe improved linear interpolation is obviously superior to\nthe second-order Lagrange interpolation. Fig. 9 displays the\ninterpolation results of the latter algorithm for consecutive\npackets loss at approximately 80 ms after the fault. When\nthe generator capacity and transformer capacity are both\n120MV A, the interpolation error is greater than the inter-\npolation error when the generator capacity and transformer\ncapacity are both 60MV A. As for the improved linear inter-\npolation under the same circumstance, the estimation error is\nonly slightly larger when the equipments are both 120MV A\nin capacity, as shown in Fig. 10.\nFIGURE 10. Comparison between the estimated and true value of\nimproved linear interpolation under packet loss.\n1) ONLY ALTERING THE GENERATOR CAPACITY\nThe transformer capacity is ﬁxed at 120MV A. The trans-\nformer current is shown in Fig. 11 when the generator capac-\nity is changed from 60MV A to 120MV A. Only altering the\nFIGURE 11. Secondary current changing with generator capacity.\nFIGURE 12. Action trajectory of protection changing with generator\ncapacity.\ngenerator capacity is essentially changing the generator’s\nequivalent impedance, which would change the amplitude\nof the current. The relative operation characteristics and tra-\njectory based on the second-order Lagrange interpolation\nalgorithm are shown in Fig. 12.\nBefore the fault appears, if the generator capacity is\nsmaller, the current is smaller. Therefore, the estimation error\nis smaller and more packets are tolerable to be lost without\ncausing protection mal-operation. In the early stage of the\nfault, the steady-state current suddenly jumps to short-circuit\ncurrent. During this period, the data before the packet loss is\ninvolved in calculating the missing data. As the current trans-\nfers into short-circuit current, the calculated ﬁgures gradually\nincrease, and the operation trajectory passes through the turn-\ning point of the characteristic curve, making the BtPL at a\nminimum. After the external fault occurs, the action is in the\nfolded-line area of differential protection characteristic. The\nlarger the generator capacity is, the larger short-circuit current\nis. Meanwhile, the restraint current would increase as short-\ncircuit current increases, which results in a larger correspond-\ning differential current setting. On the contrary, the relative\nerror of the estimation is small because the current is in low\nlevel. Hence, the post-fault BtPL is almost independent of\nthe generator capacity when the differential protection adopts\nMeasure 1 to 3 to cope with packet loss.\nThe performance of the improved linear interpolation in\nthe early stage of the fault is approximately the same as that\nof the linear interpolation and the second-order Lagrange\ninterpolation, but it is more excellent during the non-fault\nperiod and the later stage of the fault.\nVOLUME 7, 2019 55703\nR. Heet al.: Performance Analysis and Threshold Quantization of Transformer Differential Protection\nTABLE 2. The BtPL considering the fault types and POWs.\nFIGURE 13. Characteristics of protection changing with transformer\ncapacity.\n2) ONLY ALTERING THE TRANSFORMER CAPACITY\nIt can be seen from Table 1 that the variation tendency of\nonly altering transformer capacity is almost the same as that\nof only altering generator capacity, except that the larger the\ncapacity is, the greater the BtPL is. This is due to the fact\nthat the equivalent impedance and the current amplitude are\nchanged as the transformer capacity rises and falls. Accord-\ningly, the ratio-restrained characteristic curve of the trans-\nformer differential protection is shifted, as shown in Fig. 13.\nIn the normal operating state, the minimum setting current\nIact.min grows larger as the transformer capacity increases.\nTherefore, more packets are tolerable to be lost in this con-\ndition. However, the different transformer capacity causes\ninconspicuous difference in the event of an external fault,\nbecause the operation trajectory is in the folded-line area.\nMeanwhile, the superiority of improved linear interpolation\nbecomes less apparent because of the ratio-restrained charac-\nteristic.\n3) SIMULTANEOUSLY ALTERING GENERATOR AND\nTRANSFORMER CAPACITY\nIt can be easily induced from Table 1 that the BtPL is hardly\ninﬂuenced when the generator capacity and the transformer\ncapacity are changed concurrently. When the capacity of the\nprevious two devices becomes K times as large as before,\nthe equivalent reactance reduces into 1/k of before, and fault\ncurrent also increases into K times the size of before. The\nsame is true for Iact.min and Ires.min, so they make no differ-\nence to the BtPL.\nB. CHANGING FAULT TYPE AND POINT ON WAVE\n1) ALTERING THE STARTING POSITION OF FAULT\nTable 2 implies how the BtPL is impacted by the POW. When\nthe starting position of fault varies, the BtPL under the same\nfault only differs in the initial stage of the fault and then\ntends to be gradually consistent as time goes on. Regardless\nof the starting position, the most likely time for protection\nmal-operation is always the initial moment of the fault, since\nthe fault current values are estimated with the values before\nthe fault, which leads to large estimation errors.\nThe performances of the second-order Lagrange interpo-\nlation and the improved linear interpolation in the condition\nof a single-phase grounding fault come into being in Fig. 14.\nCompared with the starting point of 0 ◦, the fault current with a\nstarting point of 45 ◦and 90◦has a sharp turn before and after\nthe fault. Besides, the current waveform distortion is obvi-\nous, which increases the estimation error. In consequence,\nthe BtPL is larger when the short circuit initially occurs at\nthe point of 0 ◦.\nObviously, the BtPL at the early stage of the short circuit\nhas great relationship with the abrupt change of the current\namplitudes before and after the fault.\n2) ALTERING THE FAULT TYPE\nGenerally, there is little difference in the BtPL caused by\ndifferent fault types, except that the BtPL for three-phase\nshort circuit is a little larger for its symmetry, as indicated\nin Table 2.\n55704 VOLUME 7, 2019\nR.

Although the second-order Lagrange interpola-\ntion performs slightly better than the linear interpolation in\ncomputing the BtPL during the later period of the fault, it does\nworse in accuracy during the early stage. In terms of affecting\nthe BtPL, the improved linear interpolation performs as well\nas the linear interpolation in the early stage of failure, but it\nis greatly impacted by the type of fault and the starting point\non wave. As time goes on, the symmetry of the waveform\nis restored and the estimation accuracy is greatly improved,\nleaving little possibility for protection mal-operation.\nFIGURE 15. The TtPL under different sampling frequency.\nC. CHANGING THE SAMPLING FREQUENCY\nFig. 15 displays how the TtPL varies when the sampling\nfrequency is changed from 4kHz to 1kHz during the exter-\nnal single-phase grounding fault. The zero-ﬁlling estimation\nalgorithm is greatly inﬂuenced by the sampling rate, while\nvarious interpolation algorithms are less affected. Relatively\nspeaking, the lower sampling rate is, the lower tolerance\nlevel is.\nVI. MISS OPERATION ANALYSIS OF TRANSFORMER\nDIFFERENTIAL PROTECTION DURING INTERNAL FAULT\nIn this case, an internal A-phase grounding fault appears at\nposition F3, the sampling frequency is set to 4 kHz, and\nFIGURE 16.

The\ninterpolation results and the protection operation trajectory\nare shown in Fig. 16 when 40 packets are consecutively lost\nin the early stage of the fault. The estimation results and the\nprotection operation characteristic and trajectory are shown\nin Fig. 17 when 40 consecutive packets are initially lost at\n80ms after the fault ﬁrst occurs.\nFIGURE 17. Performance of improved linear interpolation during the later\nperiod of internal fault. (a) Packet loss ofI1. (a) Packet loss ofI2.\nDue to the estimation errors, the protection action tra-\njectory doesn’t perfectly match the actual one when packet\nloss happens during an internal fault, whether in the early\nstage or later stage. But luckily, the trajectory is far away\nfrom the restrained area, which can also be observed from\nFig. 3. In general, the SV packet loss would scarcely cause\nmiss operation of differential protection during an internal\nfault.\nVII. CONCLUSIONS\nIn conclusion, the protective function is hardly affected when\nonly a single packet is lost, but protection mal-operation may\nbe present due to consecutive packets loss in the normal\nVOLUME 7, 2019 55705\nR.

Compared with\nthe zero-ﬁlling method, the interpolation algorithm can effec-\ntively improve the protection performance against packet\nloss/delay. Especially, the performance of the improved linear\ninterpolation is extraordinarily excellent in the normal run-\nning condition or in the later stage of the fault. The minimum\nthreshold of consecutive SV packets loss resulting in protec-\ntion mal-operation during the early stage of fault is always\nlow, regardless of the estimation algorithms. On the contrary,\nprotection miss operation is seldom likely to occur even if\nconsecutive packets are lost during an internal fault, since the\naction trajectory is always s far from the restrained area.\nThe study shows that with simple interpolation algorithm\nas well as properly adjusted through-current restrained char-\nacteristics of differential protection, mal-operation and miss\noperation of communication-based protection in smart sub-\nstation caused by SV packet loss/delay can be almost avoid-\nable, which is helpful to understand the relay protection\noperation in the smart substation.\nREFERENCES\n[1] S.
