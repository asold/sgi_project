K. Ngwenyama 1,2* & M. N. Gitau 1,2\nThis work examines the application of machine learning (ML) algorithms to evaluate dissolved \ngas analysis (DGA) data to quickly identify incipient faults in oil-immersed transformers (OITs). \nTransformers are pivotal equipment in the transmission and distribution of electrical power. The \nfailure of a particular unit during service may interrupt a massive number of consumers and disrupt \ncommercial activities in that area. Therefore, several monitoring techniques are proposed to ensure \nthat the unit maintains an adequate level of functionality in addition to an extended useful lifespan. \nDGA is a technique commonly employed for monitoring the state of OITs. The understanding of DGA \nsamples is conversely unsatisfactory from the perspective of evaluating incipient faults and relies \nmainly on the proficiency of test engineers. In the current work, a multi-classification model that is \ncentered on ML algorithms is demonstrated to have a logical, precise, and perfect understanding of \nDGA. The proposed model is used to analyze 138 transformer oil (TO) samples that exhibited different \nstray gassing characteristics in various South African substations. The proposed model combines the \ndesign of four ML classifiers and enhances diagnosis accuracy and trust between the transformer \nmanufacturer and power utility. Furthermore, case reports on transformer failure analysis using \nthe proposed model, IEC 60599:2022, and Eskom (Specification—Ref: 240-75661431) standards are \npresented. In addition, a comparison analysis is conducted in this work against the conventional DGA \napproaches to validate the proposed model. The proposed model demonstrates the highest degree of \naccuracy of 87.7%, which was produced by Bagged Trees, followed by Fine KNN with 86.2%, and the \nthird in rank is Quadratic SVM with 84.1%.\nWith the radical growth in the power system capacity, the demands for power generation, transmission, and \ndistribution, have become  greater1. As a significant piece of equipment for power distribution in power systems, \nthe power transformer (PT) is critical for the secure operation of the complete power system. The occurrence of \na fault in a PT will result in damage to the unit. The most severe faults might even cause the failure of the entire \npower system, adversely affecting the functioning of the total national economy. Thus, it is beneficial to exam -\nine fault diagnosis technology relating to  PTs2. PT faults usually emerge from electrical and thermal stresses, \nsuch faults vary merely in their energy, site, and time of occurrence. The oil temperature increases and several \ngases will be generated when the fault occurs. Generally, the combustible gasses found in the TO in service are \nhydrogen (H2) , methane (CH4) , ethane (C2H2) , ethylene (C2H 4) , and acetylene (C2H 6)3,4. The pollutants in oil \nare mostly the consequence of the degradation of insulating elements (oil or sheet) because of faults or chemical \nresponses in the apparatus in question.\nThe quality and quantity of disintegrated gases have a prominent function in assessing the fault type in  PTs5,6. \nMany conventional techniques have been developed to analyze transformer faults with gas chromatography; a \nprocedure where a chemical combination transported through a gas or liquid is broken down into its constitu-\nent parts as a result of the substances flowing differently along or above a static solution. Such schemes for fault \nanalysis are usually categorized into three types, specifically, the distinctive gas  scheme7–10, the gas production \nrate  scheme10, and the three-ratio  scheme11–13. In China, over 50% of the PT faults in the energy system were \nevaluated by employing DGA-based analysis schemes which analyze transformer fault types and their severity \nfollowing the content, proportion to one another, and the gas production rate of the DGs in the  TO13.

Such schemes usually employ numerous gas ratios or \ncompare gas levels with the appointed criteria to analyze the state of a PT. However, most of these conventional \nanalysis techniques provide a restricted impact to a transformer’s fault analysis, which is unable to precisely iden-\ntify its correct fault type. Particularly, it is extremely complex to precisely determine the fault state with several \nDGs, a great probability of misdiagnosis will occur when the calculated and analyzed gas ratio is near the critical \n value19. Furthermore, the more comprehensive the classifications of fault types are, the lesser the precision rate \nof fault analysis is, and vice versa. Moreover, rough classifications are not conducive to the fault analysis of a PT, \nand it is challenging to meet the demands of applications.\nDGA is a technique for detecting and forecasting problems in OITs by (i) determining the levels of various \ngases contained in the insulation oil, as well as respective gas rates and gas proportions, (ii) fault detection utiliz-\ning diagnosis instruments such as  KG20,21, IEC  ratios22, Rogers  ratios23, Doernenburg  ratios24 and Duval  triangle23. \nNevertheless, these instruments have certain flaws. In certain situations, the computed gas ratios deviate from \nthe instruments’ specified ratio codes. Faults that develop within the transformer might be  undetectable25. Addi-\ntionally, these instruments can produce various analytical outcomes for the equivalent dissolved gas (DG) file, \nmaking it challenging for experts to reach a definitive conclusion when confronted with such a wide range of \n data26. Due to these constraints, several scientists have developed systems that are integrated with ML approaches \nthat use historical DGA information to forecast imminent or undiscovered faults for diagnosing faults. The com-\nplexity of identifying the appropriate fault situation and the analytic precisions for units under fault categories \nare defined by these  aspects27,28. The KG ratios, as well as graphic depiction schemes, are all DGA schemes that \nare utilized as data inputs to ML classifiers for fault classification. In the current study, a multi-classification \nmodel that is centered on ML algorithms is shown to have an intelligible, precise, and clear understanding of \nDGA. This enthusiasm is supported by (i) efficient adaptation to fresh data in ML; (ii) for structural layout, ML \nneeds minimal exertion (i.e. several control settings are involved.); and (iii) the capability of ML to categorize \nunpredictable  issues29. Capitalizing on these benefits, the proposed model is used to analyze and evaluate the \nstate and suitable gas name subscription of 138 TO samples that exhibited different stray gassing characteristics \nin various South African substations. The model uses four ML classifiers, namely: (i) Decision Tree (DT) 30; (ii) \nSupport Vector Machine (SVM) 31; (iii) K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) 32; and (iv) Ensemble Classifier (EC) 33. \nThese classifiers are applied for oil sample classification and are selected based on their capacity to compare new \ndata inputs to existing data to identify the class that closely resembles existing classes to place new data within. \nIn MATLAB/Simulink, the proposed model serves as the framework underlying the various classifiers and is \ndesigned to aggregate ML algorithms for information-gathering activities. A detailed summary of the various \nML classifiers utilized in this work is provided in the section that follows:\n• DT: As shown in Fig. 1, the DT  classifier34 is an ML technique that makes predictions using a tree structure. \nIt builds a flowchart-like tree structure where each internal node represents a feature test, each branch repre-\nsents a test outcome, and each leaf node stores a class label. It is constructed by constantly splitting the train-\ning data into subsets depending on feature values until a stopping requirement is met, such as the maximum \ndepth of the tree or the minimum number of samples needed to divide a node. The method replicates the \noperation for every split subgroup that is the offspring of a given node. Lastly, the tree is trimmed by deleting \nlimbs that are not useful for classification.\n• SVM: The working of the SVM  classifier35 can be understood by using Fig.  2. SVMs fall within the broad \ngroup of kernel  schemes36 that rely solely on data using mark pairings. To guarantee that the hyperplane \nis as broad as feasible across categories, the kernel function determines an estimation product for certain \npotentially large-scale feature regions. SVMs possess the benefits of becoming less mathematically intensive \ncompared to different methods of classification, performing well in large-scale areas, as well as managing \nFigure 1.  Example of DT.\n3\nVol.:(0123456789)Scientific Reports |          (2024) 14:376  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-50833-7\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nunpredictable classification effectively by utilizing the kernel trick, which subsequently converts the data area \ninto a different large-scale feature area.\n• KNN: The KNN  classifier37 is a monitored learning approach utilized for numerous machine learning scenar-\nios. It arranges elements using the nearest trained samples in the characteristic domain. The goal underlying \nKNN is to locate a well-known amount of training data that is nearest in proximity to a particular querying \ncase and estimate the querying case’s category based on them. Regarding categorization, KNN is comparable \nto a DT method, except that rather than developing a tree, instead, it creates a route through the graph. KNNs \nare also quicker compared to DTs. The working of the KNN is shown in Fig. 3.\n• EC: The ensemble  classifier38 produces classification forecasts using a set of classifiers, which achieves more \naccurate specialization than one classifier and results in an improved measurement grade. A dataset is used \nto train a list of classifiers, and the separate predictions made by each of the classifiers applied to the dataset \nform the basis of EC. The ensemble model then combines the outcomes of each classifier prediction to get \nthe final result. This sort of classifier remains simple to simulate but is often appropriate for large samples. \nThe working of the EC is shown in Fig. 4.\nIn monitoring the insulation status in OITs, several chemical and electrical processes are employed, such \nas DGA and Furan Analysis (FA), which indicate the Degree of Polymerization (DP) of the cellulose  paper6,39. \nDGA is one of the most common methods for detecting an incipient fault in PTs. DGA can be used to assess \npresent-day transformer status, predict future failures, and identify inconvenient transformer operations to pro-\nvide appropriate maintenance planning. Figure 5 illustrates the standard technique employed by the transformer \nmanufacturing sector to collect transformer oil on-site for DGA at the testing facility.\nThe presented DGA approaches do not contain any mathematical development, and the assessment depends \non an experiential method that can vary depending on the expertise of the laboratory analyst, which results in \nunpredictable  assessment40. To overcome this limitation, several computational models based on ML have been \nused in assessing incipient faults in PTs. In the proposed research work, recent related studies and their contri-\nbutions to transformer fault diagnosis have been highlighted and a multi-classification model for transformer \nfault diagnosis is proposed. Table 1 presents a comparative study of the existing recent survey and the proposed \nmodel for transformer fault analysis.\nContribution and novelty\nResearch contribution\nThis research work provided a summary of recent transformer fault analysis. Several ML-based techniques based \non conventional DGA approaches have been discussed. The following are the contributions of the proposed \nresearch analysis:\n• A multi-classification model for fault diagnosis is proposed, that enhances diagnostic accuracy and optimism \nbetween transformer manufacturer and power utility.\nFigure 2.

The seven fault categories utilized in the IEC \n60599:2022 standard were considered and concluded that the degree of accuracy for fault detection is not ideal as \na consequence of the limits defined by the gas ratio codes, and leads to \"not detectable\" in certain cases scenarios. \nHowever, after introducing the proposed model, the analysis is on an equal footing with the actual fault analysis. \nFurthermore, this research work addressed the optimal ratios of fault analysis. It is crucial to train the proposed \nmodel. Consequently, the DGA data utilized to train the proposed model is made up of samples that cover all \nknown types of faults as defined by the IEC 60599:2022 standard. According to the findings of this research, the \nforecasting of transformer faults employing the proposed model as well as the IEC 60599:2022 gas ratio technique \nis comparable to actual fault analysis and offers an improvement over the IEC 60599:2022 gas ratio technique.\nPaper organization\nThe rest of the work is structured as follows: Section “ Review of existing DGA approaches ” provides an over-\nview of current DGA approaches. Section “Applicable works” provides an overview of techniques employed by \nresearchers to explore DGA. Section “Proposed approach” discusses the research approach and model. Section \n“Materials and protocols” presents the materials and protocols of the study. Section “Results” presents the results \nand discussions that validate the proposed model. and finally, Section “ Conclusions” presents the conclusions \nof this work.\nReview of existing DGA approaches\nThere are several procedures for diagnosing deformities in transformer insulation. DGA analysis strategies are \ndependent on scientific hypotheses and practical knowledge gained by specialists across the  world45,46. However, \nif these analysis strategies are not implemented with caution, they might detect abnormalities erroneously since \nthey simply signal potential  faults47. DGA strategies can vary regarding diagnosed faults in several instances, \nwhich is undesirable for an accurate fault analytic  technology48. Flammable and non-flammable gases can be \ndiscovered within the gases contained in the oil, as shown in Table 2. These gases can also be categorized based on \nthe type of fault that induced them, as shown in Table 3. Gas levels, KGs, KG ratios, and graphic interpretations \nare mutual ideologies adopted in analysis  strategies49. The DGA can recognize different faults such as partial \ndischarge, excessive heat, as well as arcing in a wide range of PTs. A single dataset is required for the efficiency \nanalysis and analytical comparison of conventional DGA  approaches50. Figure 6 illustrates a dataset of potential \ntransformer faults. Furthermore, DGA can give the timely detection required to maximize the probability of \nestablishing a suitable  remedy51,52. Numerous informative techniques based on DGA to identify the emerging \nfault type have been stated. In this work, seven of the DGA approaches were explored: (i) the CIGRE approach, \n(ii) the Doernenburg ratio approach, (iii) the KG approach, (iv) the Nomograph approach, (v) the IEC ratio \napproach, (vii) Duval triangle approach, and (viii) Rogers ratio approach.\nThese approaches are experimental, with assumptions established on relationships between gases discovered \nthrough gas  analysis54. For instance, The Rogers Ratio technique considers the ratios of H2 , CH4 , C2H 6 , C2H 4 , and \nC2H2 to create code acknowledging fault analysis.

The ratios of the approaches are illustrated as: R1:(CH 4/H2)\n, R2:(C2H 2/C2H 4); R3:(C2H 2/CH4); R4:(C2H 6/C2H 2); and R5:(C2H 4/C2H 6).\nCIGRE approach\nThis  approach55 explores KG ratios and gas levels. The 5 KG ratios evaluated using this approach are C2H 2/C2H 6\n,H 2/CH4,C2H 4/C2H 6,C2H 2/H2 , and CO/CO 2 . A transformer is declared efficient if consecutive deployments of \nthese approaches produce gas ratios and levels that are within permissible thresholds. The incidence of catas-\ntrophes in PTs discussed in Ref.56 is graphically shown in Fig.  7. The catastrophe statistics of CIGRE consist of \napproximately 800  catastrophes57.\nDoernenburg ratio approach\nReserve integrated safety sensors (RIS2) are required in this approach, and a significant volume of gas is required \nto demonstrate its application. RIS2 is an essential accessory in the protection of oil transformers. It allows con-\ntinuous control of the pressure, temperature, oil level, and gas states. The work presented in Ref.58 states that gas \nratio approaches utilize encoding algorithms that designate certain pairings of codes to specific fault categories \nfor efficient fault identification. The codes are formed by estimating gas level ratios as well as comparing them \nto predefined values acquired from experience and constantly modified. The author discovered that when a gas \ncomposition matches the code for a certain fault, a fault state is identified. In Ref. 59, the approach was applied \nto diagnose faults by monitoring gas levels of CH 4/H2 , C2H 2/CH4 , C2H 4/C2H 6 and C2H 2/C2H 4 . To determine \nwhether there is an actual fault with the unit, the concentration of the gases must initially exceed the acceptable \nlimits, and is adequate formation of each gas for the ratio analysis must be present to be  valid60. Table 4 demon-\nstrates the KGs as well as their concentration limits.\nKG approach\nThis  approach61,62 monitors the gases emitted from TO upon a failure, which causes the temperature in the trans-\nformer to rise. It must be noted that the utility of oil in the transformer provides insulation, and cooling, and \nhelps quench arc. This approach is the most critical and commonly utilized since it presents the earliest signal \nof an incident. Table  5 demonstrates the diagnostic explanations by using different KG concentrations. The \nppm concentration standard value limit detected in PTs according to IEC 60599:2022 is specified in Table  6. \nFigure 6.

According to the IEEE standard, \nKGs are gases produced in OITs that alert to observational fault-type diagnostics, depending on which gases are \ncommon or prominent at certain temperature  levels63. If there is no previous DG data is provided for analysis, \nhazards in the apparatus can be detected and evaluated using the guidelines indicated in Table 7. Healthy opera-\ntion is represented by State 1. State 2 signifies that the instrument is possibly malfunctioning, with overall gases \nexceeding normal concentrations. State 3 implies a high amount of degradation. State 4 indicates that excessive \ndeterioration and continued operation may end in failure or  breakdown64,65.\nNomograph approach\nThe  author66 proposed the Nomograph approach to enhance fault analysis precision through the combination of \nfault gas  ratios67. It was proposed to supply both a visual demonstration of fault-gas data as well as the resources \nto understand its importance. The Nomograph is built from upright exponential measurements that depict the \namounts of various gases. Using this methodology, straight lines are created between neighboring measurements \nto link the dots reflecting different gas level values. The gradients of these lines serve as a guide for diagnosing \nthe type of fault. The key (T) across the two axes specifies the fault type for the two axes. The positioning of the \nline about the intensity scales allows you to determine the degree of the fault. The example to calculate the value \nof T is shown in Fig. 8.\nTable 4.

The gases \nare employed to harvest three gas ratios, namely: C2H 2/C2H 4 , CH 4/H2 as well as C2H 2/C2H 6 . There are two \ncritical considerations to emphasize regarding the approach. Different countries utilize differing ratios, as well \nas (the C2H 2/C2H 6) ratio usually employed to substitute the (CH 4/H2) ratio. The ratios should be identified \nmainly when one of the DGs contains a significant concentration and/or a fast-rising  rate69. Table 9 depicts the \nIEC standard for describing fault types and provides estimates for the 3 KG ratios using prescribed fault analy-\nsis. Whenever key-gas ratios exceed certain limitations, incipient faults in the transformer are to be  foreseen70.\n(1)T = (1.84S + 4.66)0.37+ (1.21R)1.333,\nFigure 8.

Even though this approach is regarded \nas simple to implement, incorrect classifications might occur because no section of the triangle is identified as \na sample of typical  aging72,73. Therefore, before adopting this approach to examine transformers that have been \nin operation for several years, the acceptable level of DG must be identified. A fault is detected by summing \nthe quantities of the three Duval Triangle gases CH4 , C2H2 , and C2H 4 as well as extrication the sum by the \nvolume of each gas to get the proportion of each gas overall. The intensities of CH 4,C 2H 4, as well as C2H 2 are \nindicated as a proportion of the overall ( CH 4 +C 2H 4 +C 2H 2) and specify a point (%CH 4, %C 2H 4, and %C 2H 2) \nin an organized structure denoted in a triangle, which has been sub-divided in separate  zones74. Each zone is \ncorrelated to a specific class of fault. The Duval triangle solely contains areas correlated to fault events; there is \nno area for normal states. As a result, this approach can only be utilized to classify the kind of fault in the situ-\nation of a defective  transformer75,76. Figure 9 shows the fault type identified in each zone. Internal transformer \nfailures are classified into five kinds based on DL/T 722–2000 and IEC 60599–2022 standards: partial discharge \n(PD), low energy discharge (D1) and high energy discharge (D2), thermal faults; < 300 °C (T1), thermal fault; \n300 °C–700 °C (T2) and a combination of thermal and electrical faults (DT)77,78. Figure 9 may be interpreted in \na table that shows the fault limitations, which are represented in Table 8.\nRogers ratio approach\nThis approach adopts the exact protocol as the Doernenburg Approach, but just three proportions are utilized, \nand the approach’s validity is not dependent on the gas concentration  threshold71,80. This approach is proficient \nsince it compares the outcomes of several failure diagnoses with the gas testing of each trial. Nevertheless, \ncertain ratios in this approach are inconsistent with the analytic codes allocated for specific  faults81. Faults are \ndiagnosed using a basic coding technique based on ratio intervals, as illustrated in Tables  10 and 1182. Table 12 \nshows the proportions for DG in the oil as well as free gases, including the indicated failure detection based on \nthe Rogers Approach. The coding results in 12 distinct forms of transformer malfunctions. Table  13 shows the \ndifferent types of faults depending on the code.\nFigure 9.

Concerning the faults of the above-men-\ntioned conventional schemes, artificial intelligence (AI) schemes of PT fault analysis have attracted substantial \nconsideration due to their superior flexibility and influential fault analysis presentation (e.g. expert system \n(EPS)83, fuzzy  theory84,  SVM85, extreme learning machine (ELM)86, as well as  ANN87). EPS remains a clever AI \nsetup scheme linked with skilled knowledge, which can analyze faults more thoroughly, precisely, and instantly.\nFor instance, in Refs.49,88, the author built an EPS for PT insulation fault analysis, which undertook DGA as \nthe normal factor. The analysis results demonstrated that the suggested EPS can thoroughly examine the insula-\ntion state of a unit and detect the type of fault accurately. In Ref.89, the authors reported an instinctive fuzzy EPS \nto analyze PT faults, in such a manner that the approximation of KG ratio in the TO can be easier. The fuzzy \nconcept mostly analyzes the interrelations amongst fuzzy matters, so it can handle these matters appropriately \nwith fuzziness and ambiguity.\nTable 11.

SVM \nis an AI system based on the numerical learning hypothesis which holds impressive benefits in non-linear com-\nplications. The  author92 examined a new extension technique in which an SVM was utilized to examine the PT’s \nfaults and to elect the extremely applicable gas signature among the DGA conventional approaches and a new \nextension technique. The examination outcomes showed that the new extension technique as well as the SVM \nscheme can notably enhance the analysis precisions for PT fault categorization.\nThe authors in Ref.93 suggested an improved prototype merging SVM with a genetic algorithm (SVMG) to \nanalyze PT faults. The trial outcomes revealed that the SVMG technique can accomplish better ranking analytical \nprecision compared to the IEC three ratios, typical SVM classifier, as well as ANN. ELM is a developing learning \nprocedure that has been initiated for transformer fault analysis in current years. In Ref. 3, the author employed \nELM mixed with PCA to categorize the initial faults of PTs and assessed its execution with fuzzy logic as well as \nANN. The evaluated outcomes demonstrated that ELM could supply decent analysis findings. Again in Ref. 51, \nthe author proposed an integrated particle swarm optimization (PSO) as well as an ELM technique to analyze \nPT faults.\nDespite that, these analysis techniques examined earlier retain their fundamental disadvantages as follows: (i) \nFor EPS, a complete understanding root is a vital feature to guarantee the precision of analysis. Nevertheless, it \nis challenging to acquire a comprehensive knowledge base. Moreover, the EPS produces inadequate understand-\ning capability; (ii) Fuzzy theory is challenging to establish a suitable link equation linking the input and output \n parameters94; (iii) SVM is a double-categorization procedure, that causes difficulty in terms of constructing an \nacquiring mechanism, choosing kernel features, and establishing variables in dual-classification challenges. Con-\nsequently, SVM has the inherent deficiency of low categorization  effectiveness95,96; (iv) The execution of ELM is \nnot balanced given that its concealed layer variable is casually selected. Compared to the fault analysis techniques \ndiscussed in Section “Review of existing DGA approaches” , the neural network has an extra general function in \nfault analysis of PTs due to its lack of sophistication, solid nonlinear-fitting capability, and high accuracy. For \ninstance, the authors in Ref. 97 used a neural-fuzzy network to determine the initial faults in PTs, as well as to \nexecute and examine the anticipated procedure using simulation trials. In Ref.98 the author published validated \nresearch for selecting the best multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network simulation through comparisons of \ntwo output data kinds and three concealed layer categories. According to the trial findings, MLP neural network \nratio amalgamation simplifies more accurately compared to different MLP neural network simulations.\nIn Ref.99, the author presented an ML-based scheme for PT fault analysis based on DGA, a bat algorithm \n(BA), as well as improving the probabilistic neural network (PNN). Investigation revealed that the recommended \nANN-based approach was detected more precisely when compared to the Rogers ratios technique when a DGA \ntechnique centered on ANN was applied. The back propagation neural networks (BPNN) model is a highly \ncommon one amongst several neural network processes and it is being broadly utilized in various grounds of \nfault analysis. In particular, power electronic  systems100,  transformers101,  batteries102,103, photovoltaic systems \n(PV)104,105, etc. be that as it may, the BPNN model still has several underlying deficiencies, for instance, dull \nmerging speed and over-fitting  difficulty106,107. Fortunately, a significant compilation of optimization processes \nhas been established to optimize the BPNN version, such as Genetic algorithm (GA) 108–111, Means end analysis \n(MEA)112, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) 113,114, Simulated Annealing (SA) 115,  BA116,117, etc. Adaptive sys-\ntems, including GA and MEA, are among these techniques and are currently utilized as optimizing approaches \naiming for the perfect weights and limitations of ANNs.\nProposed approach\nIn this work, a multi-classification model that is based on ML algorithms is presented to have an intelligible, \nprecise, and clear understanding of DGA. Transformers are pivotal equipment in the transmission and distri-\nbution of electrical power. The failure of a particular unit during service may interrupt a massive number of \nconsumers and disturb commercial activities in that area. Therefore, several monitoring techniques are proposed \nto ensure that the unit maintains an adequate level of functionality in addition to an extended useful lifespan. \nDGA is a technique commonly employed for monitoring the state of OITs. The understanding of DGA samples \nis however unsatisfactory from the perspective of evaluating incipient faults and relies mainly on the proficiency \nof test engineers.\nThe proposed model is utilized to investigate as well as assess the state and suitable gas name subscription of \n138 TO samples that revealed different stray gassing characteristics in various South African substations. This \nis achieved by employing four ML classifiers. The advantages of the selected classifiers are discussed in Section \n“Introduction” of this study. The primary objective of this study requires the development of an ML-based \nhealth index (HI) model. It is suggested that HI be used to forecast the predicted output parameter, which is \nconceptually connected to the input characteristics, centered on the crucial  assessment4. SVM can generate fresh \ninformation and categorize non-linear problems. KNN, in comparison, serves as a reliable, trained ML classifier \nthat may be used to address categorization and prediction issues. Its primary drawback is the fact that it gets \nmuch more sluggish as the amount of data being used grows. During the normalizing step, the normalized ratio \nof every gas in every data collection sample is introduced. Figure  10 shows a flowchart that depicts an outline \nof the planned research.\n12\nVol:.(1234567890)Scientific Reports |          (2024) 14:376  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-50833-7\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nDataset preparation\nRelating to the 138 oil samples, 83 oil samples are utilized as training data, 25 oil samples as testing data, and the \nremaining 30 oil samples for validation purposes. The DT, SVM, KNN, and EC classifiers serve as a parameter \nto the HI model to forecast a trait. As a result, the presented HI computation technique will be considerably less \ncostly. HI prognosis classifications are utilized as feature inputs with the transformer, and monitored modeling \nis applied. The developed HI framework must be solidly verified before it can be employed in practical applica-\ntions. The dataset is loaded and distributed into the feature inputs (x) as well as feature outputs (y). The feature \ninputs are gases: (H2) , (CH4) , (C2H 4) , (C2H 6) , and (CO) level in ppm, and feature outputs are faults category. \nIn this present research, 83 oil samples are classified as training, 25 oil samples as evaluation, and the final 30 \noil samples as verification. In Fig.  11, the function block diagram on the proposed model is illustrated for the \ndiagnosis of various incipient transformer faults.\nThe proposed model generates a system response based on the feature inputs ( x) as well as targeted feature \noutputs (y) absorbed into the network. The construction of a multi-classification model includes the identifica-\ntion of the best-performing system training techniques and parameters. In this present research, parameters are \ndeveloped implicitly by considering efficiency and network reliability. The diagnostic gas contents acquired by \nDGA serve as the experimental base for diagnosis. The content data reflects the transformer conditions. These \ndiagnostic gases include (H2) , (CH4) , (C2H 4) , (C2H 6) , and (CO) . To increase the effect of classification, the con-\ntents of these diagnostic gases are pre-processed using a specific data processing method, and seven features for \nfault diagnosis are extracted for the proposed model. From the successful implementation of the model, it can \nbe concluded that the model has some potential advantages, which are as follows:\n• It is a highly regularized strategy that is suitable for ill-posed issues.\n• It offers a unique approach and has a high training curve/speed.\nExperimental setup\nThe training databank of 138 TO samples is used to develop the proposed model. A k-fold cross-validation \nmethod is employed in the development of the model. The k-fold cross-validation method is employed to assess \nFigure 10.  Research flowchart for MC model.\nFigure 11.  Function block diagram on the proposed model.\n13\nVol.:(0123456789)Scientific Reports |          (2024) 14:376  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-50833-7\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nthe model’s competence with new data. The procedure has a single parameter called k that refers to the number of \ngroups that a given data sample is to be split into. In the setup, a 30-fold cross-validation approach is employed to \nexecute the experiment. As a result, during the 30-fold validation process, the operation is performed numerous \ntimes with varied partitions of the data findings into 30 parts. When a specific value for k  is selected, it may be \nused in place of k in the reference to the model, such as k = 30 becoming 30-fold cross-validation. It implies that \nthe model will be evaluated several times to increase confidence in the model design. This eliminates the concept \nof training the model only once and not knowing if the positive result is due to luck or not. Cross-validation is \na strategy for testing ML models that involves training numerous ML models on subsets of the given input data \nand then evaluating them on the corresponding subset. Cross-validation can be used to detect overfitting, or the \nfailure to generalize a pattern. Performing 30-fold cross-validation generates 30 models, 30 data sources to train \nthe models, 30 data sources to evaluate the models and 30 evaluations, one for each model.\nIn the present study, to evaluate the efficiency, several classifiers were put to work: (i) DT, (ii) SVM, (iii) KNN, \nand (iv) EC. Consequently, before the construction of the ML model, the settings of the proposed classifiers need \nto be established. Table 14 summarizes the ML setting configuration. The forward selection feature of stepwise \n regression118 is used in the setup. Each term is either removed or included as a feature input vector according to \nthe p-value of the present or newly entered data inputs. The p-value determines the likelihood it is to obtain a \ncertain result when the null-hypothesis is assumed to be true. The null-hypothesis is the argument in scientific \nstudy, that no relationship exists between two sets of data or variables being trained/tested. The null-hypothesis \nstates that any empirically observed difference is due only to chance and that no fundamental causal relationship \nexists, thus the word \"null\" 119. As a result, if the null-hypothesis is considered to be true, the p -value estimates \nhow odd the tested sample is. The likelihood of a null-hypothesis experiment is denoted as a p -value using the \nα parameter for term addition as well as the β   parameter120 for term deletion. The α  and β parameters are the \nthreshold values against which p-values are measured. It demonstrates how significant the observed results must \nbe for a significance test to reject the null-hypothesis. Every data entry point indicates a different form of gas \ncollected from DGA. The p-value following a stepwise regression analysis was used to choose the input data. The \nbenefit of the p-value is that its parameters can be experimentally modified to achieve the best results.\nTraining and testing of the ML models\nAs the input characteristics are supplied through the transformer HI estimation, supervisory training is adopted. \n83 of the oil samples are classified as training, 25 as evaluation, and the final 30 oil samples as verification. To \naccommodate the narrow distribution of data, an evaluation threshold of 30 was utilized, particularly for the \n\"Very Poor\" data. In Ref. 121, even though 83 of the transformer HI classifications are chosen to be utilized for \ntraining along with 25 for assessment, minimal transformer HI classifications are evaluated. As a result, obtain-\ning more accurate data distribution is advantageous. Furthermore, a cross-validation approach is adopted for \ndetecting overfitting or underfitting. After the model has been cross-validated, the settings can be adjusted for \nthe next model if it does not meet the required standards. In light of this, a 30-fold cross-validation approach is \ncarried out in a manner comparable to selection in Ref.122. The 30-fold validating approach is carried out repeat-\nedly using different 30-part splits within the test findings. Furthermore, in this work, a comparison analysis is \nalso conducted against the conventional DGA approaches to certify the proposed model.\nClassification accuracy\nThe proposed model is tested using 30-testing datasets. The precision of the classification indicates how frequently \na classification algorithm is accurate. The formula for the Sfn is given in (2).\nwhere Sfn is the proportion of valid prognosis of a certain fault type, fn , and P is the valid  prognosis11.\nConsistency (C) indicates the precision of the model in each dataset.

In contrast to an overhead power line that \nis painless to overhaul, transformers are factory-sealed, denying technicians on-site the ability to inspect their \nactive-part assemblies. The inception of faults of transformers during operation generates considerable hammer-\ning of revenues to power utility owners in addition to the excessive damages or replacement expenditures and \nthe probability of an explosion. DGA is the only available scheme that provides the means to feasibly identify \nincipient transformer faults. Though the estimation precision of DGA schemes remains reasonably eminent, the \nschemes employed to understand DGA samples remain dependent on the proficiency of test engineers as opposed \nto precise interpretation. This work consequently sought to introduce and carry out a novel multi-classification \nML-based DGA interpretation scheme that explains DGA samples strictly concerning multinomial data sets.\nThe oil samples used in this research came from several South African power stations. The databank contains \nfive flammable gases initiated from distinct oil specimens collected from transformers in service. Classifica-\ntion Learner App in MATLAB/Simulink was employed to train the gas concentrations of 138 oil samples. The \nproposed MATLAB model is valid since the coding tool, MATLAB Simulink as well as the toolbox are widely \nutilized in the research and engineering field. The Classification Learner tool is a highly efficient platform that \nallows you to engage with data, choose features, establish cross-validation methods, train models, and evaluate \n outcomes13,20,90. It is used for routine activities such as:\n• Data import and cross-validation scheme configuration.\n• Data exploration as well as feature selection.\n• Model training employing different classification tools.\n• Model comparison and evaluation.\nResearchers can develop and verify classification models by applying different techniques through the use of \nthe Classification Learner app. Analyze the validating flaws of the simulations post-training, then select the most \naccurate model based on the outcomes. From the data, 83 oil samples are utilized as training data, 25 oil samples \nas testing data, and the remaining 30 oil samples for validation purposes. Eight classes of faults were detected \nfrom the oil data samples with a supplementary label designating a normal gas concentration. In response to 138 \noil samples investigated, there is a total of 7 types of faults present as indicated in Table 15. Five gas proportions \nare assessed by adopting the IEC 60599:2022 guideline proposal considering the six flammable gases extracted \nin the different oil  samples21.\nThe objective of the preliminary exercise was to check the oil data samples so that faults may be detected and \ndiagnosed. Following data pre-processing, DGA data clarification began, and a model was established utilizing \nthe stages shown in Fig.  12. The authors provided Fig.  13, which depicts the different phases, to broaden the \nreader’s perception.\nResults\nClassification Learner App in MATLAB/Simulink was utilized to train the gas concentrations of 138 oil samples \nextracted from various South African plants. ML classifiers in the Classification Learner App were selected and \na 30-fold cross-validation was used to set the training and testing data for the model. Based on the total dataset, \n83 oil samples are utilized as training data, 25 oil samples as testing data, and the remaining 30 oil samples for \nvalidation purposes. Cross-validation of 30-folds was selected, which in other words implies that the training \nand testing operations were repeated 30 times. Stepwise regression was used to choose the gases from the DGA \n(4)%A = Tsp\nTtc\n× 100\nTable 15.

The samples utilized to train as well as test the model \nhave comparable traits. The p-value examines the null-hypothesis, and it possesses a likelihood of zero. An indi-\ncator with a small p-value, such as CO , which has a value of 1.0214 × 10–34, is a good contributor to the model \nin terms of the specified characteristics. A small p-value for the gas indicates that the DGA data for that specific \ngas has a higher connection with the transformer fault type. The standard error is crucial for establishing the \nrobustness of the connection between the predictive model and the reaction variable. Furthermore, standard \nerror provides accessibility to the credibility of the p-values since it shows the numerical range that the measured \nnumbers deviate from the prediction line. As demonstrated in Table  16, a smaller standard error correlates to \na faster reaction since the model developed provides measurements of the reaction variable, which is the fault \ntype closest to the aptness line.\nThe transformer states are classified into four categories: A, B, C, and D, with A signifying excellent state, B \nsignifying fair state, C indicating that servicing is needed, and D signifying a detrimental or failing unit. This \nis shown in Table 17. The interpretations and constraints offered by national standards such as IEEE, ICE, and \nEskom standards are used to identify these categories.\nFigures 14, 15, 16 and 17 show the results of the four classifiers employed to analyze and evaluate the state and \nsuitable gas name subscription of 138 TO samples that revealed different stray gassing characteristics in various \nSouth African substations. These gases: (H2) , (CH4) , (C2H2) , (C2H 4) , and (CO) concentration were detected in 31 \nFigure 12.  ML workflow.\nFigure 13.  TO evaluation phases.\nTable 16.

PCA is a well-known feature-harvesting method in mathematical research. This method \nremoves key elements by linear conversion and obtains minimum sizes to demonstrate original  data72. As a \nresult, PCA is utilized to minimize parameter sizes, remove duplicate data, optimize classifier construction with \nminimal data loss, as well as enhance classification  efficiency29. PCA includes the following stages: (i) obtaining \nthe dataset; (ii) normalizing the dataset; (iii) calculating the correlation array; and (iv) interpreting the correla-\ntion  array55. Figure 18 depicts the principle.\nThe classification learner app utilized for ML classification in MATLAB software provides a diverse set of \nsub-classifiers. The purpose of integrating these classifiers was to achieve optimal accuracy, and then employ the \nclassifier/s that produce significant results for condition monitoring of the transformer. The results of the classifi-\ners will differ due to some classifiers experiencing overfitting/underfitting as a result of (i) training data size being \ntoo small or not containing enough data samples to accurately represent all possible input data values; (ii) when \nthe training data contains large amounts of irrelevant information, known as noisy data; and (iii) when the model \ntrains for too long on a single sample set of data. Moreover, each classifier has different strengths and attributes. \nThe training, validation, and testing process usually takes time, and the amount of time varies depending on \nthe size of the data set and the competence of the classifier. Therefore, the longer it takes to train the classifier, \nthe lower the accuracy, hence the results will be slightly different. The results of the ML classifiers are shown in \nTable 18. It is worth noting from the results that the highest degree of accuracy is 87.7%, which was produced by \nBagged Trees, followed by Fine KNN with 86.2%, and the third in rank is Quadratic SVM with 84.1%.\nFigure 18.

The accuracy of the proposed multi-classification model, consisting of \nDT, SVM, KNN, and EC is 82.6%, 84.1%, 82.6%, and 87.7% respectively. These were the outcomes of the study. \nTherefore, when these findings are compared to DGA approaches, they demonstrate a considerable increase in \nthe proportion of accurate fault-type estimation, which is above 20%.\nConclusions\nIn this work, a novel multi-classification model that is based on ML algorithms was proposed to have an intel -\nligible, precise, and perfect understanding of DGA. The proposed model was used to analyze 138 TO samples \nthat revealed different stray gassing characteristics in various South African substations. This was achieved by \nemploying four ML classifiers. Experimental evidence using DT classifier viz. Fine Tree, Medium Tree, and \nCoarse Tree suggested that these classifiers are feasible in classifying stray gas characteristics from normal TO \nwith a degree of accuracy of 82.6%. Additionally, the test results from the SVM classifier comprised Linear SVM, \nQuadratic SVM, Cubic SVM, Fine Gaussian SVM, Medium Gaussian SVM, and Course Gaussian SVM conclude \nthat these classifiers are viable in classifying stray gassing specificities with the degree of accuracy from 79 to \n84.1%. Further, experimental findings from KNN employing Fine KNN, Medium KNN, Coarse KNN, Cosine \nKNN, Cubic KNN, and Weighted KNN appear to indicate that these classifiers are feasible in classifying stray \ngassing properties with a degree of accuracy from 77.5 to 86.2%. Lastly, experimental information Boosted Trees, \nBagged Trees, Subspace Discriminant, Subspace KNN, and RUS Boosted Trees indicate that these classifiers \nare feasible in classifying stray gassing peculiarities with a degree of accuracy from 77.5 to 87.7%. The findings \ncan be explained that there are different DG concentrations in stray gassing phenomena from normal TO. In \nthis work, it was demonstrated that the gas concentrations of transformer H2 , CH4,CO , C2H 4 , and C2H 6 can be \nused to discriminate stray gassing phenomena from normal TO and their differences can be classified with the \nhighest degree of accuracy of 87.7% by the Bagged Trees classifier over other ML classifiers. It is advisable that \nthe training, testing, and validation of DGA oil samples be extended and tested several times to validate the \nfindings in this work.\nFor forthcoming studies, the findings amassed in this work can be employed as a benchmark in develop-\ning a portable device that utilizes ML algorithms herein for the validation of DGA results. Another proposal \nis that additional research is undertaken in applying DTs to formulate new stray gassing limits for the various \ngas concentrations. In this fashion, the production of DGs will be easily interpreted with proper permissible \nlevels thereby utility owners and consequently, consumers do not have to suffer from prolonged power outages. \nFurthermore, the authors will test the proposed model based on ANN algorithms and compare it to the results \npresented in this work to determine which approach yields more accurate statistics.\nData availability\nThe data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable \nrequest.\nReceived: 18 September 2023; Accepted: 26 December 2023\nReferences\n 1.
