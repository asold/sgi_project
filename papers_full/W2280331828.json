    "abstract": "In the present paper a new version of multilevel inverter is investigated. This new version is based on hybrid association of commutation cells with H-bridge cells. The association allows a significant reduction of the volume of the capacitors. In fact, presented topology allows us to work on higher input voltage levels with the same power switches. This new version is generally called as SCMI (stacked cascade multilevel inverter). The proposed inverter has potential to generate high quality waveforms, reduction in switching frequency, capable to operate at higher voltage levels and finally utilizes minimum number of switching components. The presented version of SCMI is simulated in Matlab-simulink and further, experimental validation is carried out in the laboratory with prototype setup.",
