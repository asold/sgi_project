  "abstract": "Defects in photovoltaic (PV) panels can significantly reduce the power generation efficiency of the system and may cause localized overheating due to uneven current distribution. Therefore, adopting precise pixel-level defect detection, i.e., defect segmentation, technology is essential to ensuring stable operation. However, for effective defect segmentation, the feature extractor must adaptively determine the appropriate scale or receptive field for accurate defect localization, while the decoder must seamlessly fuse coarse-level semantics with fine-grained features to enhance high-level representations. In this paper, we propose a Progressive Deformable Transformer (PDeT) for defect segmentation in PV cells. This approach effectively learns spatial sampling offsets and refines features progressively through coarse-level semantic attention. Specifically, the network adaptively captures spatial offset positions and computes self-attention, expanding the model’s receptive field and enabling feature extraction across objects of various shapes. Furthermore, we introduce a semantic aggregation module to refine semantic information, converting the fused feature map into a scale space and balancing contextual information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving an mIoU of 88.41% on our solar cell dataset, outperforming other methods. Additionally, to validate the PDeT’s applicability across different domains, we trained and tested it on the MVTec-AD dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the PDeT exhibits excellent recognition performance in various other scenarios as well.",
