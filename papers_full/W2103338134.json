    "abstract": "In the present work an attempt has been made to discuss the applicability of language model as an approach to calculate the relevance of the document by utilizing user-supplied information of those documents that are relevant to the query items.This method shall have the advantage of improving retrieval performance as we have utilized user-supplied information of those documents that are relevant to the query in question.The design and implementation of information retrieval systems is concerned with methods for storing, organizing and retrieving information from a collection of documents.The quality of a system is measured by how useful it is to the typical users of the system.In this approach, a query shall be considered generated from an \"ideal\" document that shall satisfy the information need.The system\"s job has been to calculate the frequency of the word in the given document and rank them accordingly.",
