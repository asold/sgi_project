We investigated the use of a \nmetamaterial transformer-based thermal cloak–concentrator that can change from a cloak to a \nconcentrator when the device configuration is transformed.

The dual functionality was verified by finite element simulations and validated by \nexperiments with a specimen composed of copper, epoxy, and rotating squares. This work provides an \neffective and efficient method for controlling the gradient of heat, in addition to providing a reference \nfor other thermal metamaterials to possess such controllable functionalities by adapting the concept of \na metamaterial transformer.\nThe concept of controlling energy can be traced back to the pioneering proposals by Pendry\n1 and Leonhardt2, \nwhose approaches to cloaking provided means of manipulating electromagnetic waves. Following their research, \nefforts have been devoted to modeling and designing coordinate transformation-based metamaterials, also \nknown as thermal metamaterials\n3–5, in the field of thermodynamics. Owing to the unconventional nature of \nthermal metamaterials, various applications such as the thermal cloak 6–14, thermal concentrator 15–17, thermal \ninverter18–20 and thermal illusion21–24 have been proposed.\nRecently, thermoelectric components25 have offered a method for actively controlling heat flux. Other alterna-\ntives such as the shape memory alloy26 have also been demonstrated, theoretically and experimentally, for use as \na thermal diode26, a thermal cloak–concentrator (TCC)27, and a temperature-trapping device28. Analogous to the \nthermal cloak and concentrator, a practical idea for adapting the concept of manipulating the heat flow in elec-\ntronic components has been applied29,30. In this method, the temperature within a shield area can be reduced and \nthe concentrator can be employed to collect the low-grade waste heat of electronic components. Consequently, \nthermal metamaterials have been considered an important subject for future technology and applications. \nHowever, fabrication of such materials is extremely challenging owing to the continuous change in their thermal \nproperties. The notion of discretizing thermal metamaterials into unit-cell thermal shifters, representing heat flux \nlines in local spots, was therefore recently proposed\n31. The method not only simplifies the manufacture of thermal \nmetamaterials but also maintains their functionalities, including the cloak, concentrator, diffuser, and rotator.\nRecent research on thermal metamaterials has thus focused on the controllability of functionalities. In this \nstudy, we propose a new class of thermal metamaterials, namely a metamaterial transformer (MMT), by combin-\ning unit-thermal shifters and rotating squares 32,33, a form of auxetic metamaterials 34. Rotating squares become \nthicker as the rotation angle increases to 45°. They gradually close and shrink until the rotation angle is 90°. The \nrotating squares remain in the same configuration, whereas the unit cells of the rotating squares rotate 90° rela-\ntive to each other. The proposed thermal metamaterials can possess tunable functionalities by transforming the \nconfiguration of the device. The designed MMT acts as a type of TCC that initially works as a cloak and then as a \nconcentrator after the rotation of all squares. In contrast to previous approaches that are based on shape memory \nalloys, our MMT-based TCC can realize dual functions that can be freely controlled without out-of-plane defor-\nmation. We then developed a theoretical model of the MMT-based TCC for predicting the property of the TCC \nafter the rotating squares have rotated 90°. In the following section, we demonstrate the cloaking and concentrat-\ning effect of the proposed device in both simulations and experiments.\nDepartment of Engineering Science and Ocean Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, 106, Taiwan. \nCorrespondence and requests for materials should be addressed to H.-H.H.

The commercial finite element software COMSOL Multiphysics 5.3 \nwas used for numerical simulations in this study. We performed simulations with a two-dimensional heat con-\nduction module under a steady-state condition. The MMT-based TCC was analyzed in the following three cases. \nFirst, a theoretical model was constructed to simulate the functionality of an ideal TCC and was then rotated 90°. \nSecond, an effective model composed of unit cell thermal shifters with a contact interface was constructed for \nverification. Finally, a revised effective model of the MMT-based TCC was constructed to take radiation heat loss \ninto consideration.\nFor the theoretical model, we set the top and bottom surfaces as the insulators, whereas the left and right \nboundaries were prescribed temperatures in accordance with the experimental measurements. The model com-\nprised a background material with thermal conductivity k  = 1W/(mK) in both the interior and exterior of the \ncircle, and the circular material was given theoretical anisotropic thermal conductivity (see Methods) with \nR 70 2m m2 = , =R 2m m1\n35\n2  and Lx = Ly = 210 mm, as shown in Fig. 1(a).\nThe effective TCC model was constructed based on Supplementary Tables S1 and S2. The thermal conduc -\ntivity of copper, epoxy and background materials were defined as k1, k2, and k3, respectively. The boundary con-\nditions were set identical to those in the theoretical model, and the configuration of the proposed TCC is shown \nin Fig.  1(b), with k\n1 = 400W/(mK), k2 = 0.3W/(mK), k3 = 90W/(mK), Lx = Ly = 210 mm and lx = ly = 140 mm. \nMoreover, we further considered mimicking the experimental setup by adding a thin layer of thermal compound \nin between adjacent unit cells, and set the thin-layer (0.1 mm) thermal compound with a low thermal conductiv-\nity k\n4. The choice of k4 is described in Supplementary Section 1 and discussed later.\nThe experimental setup consisted of a thermal infrared (IR) camera (Fluke Ti-450), heat baths (Aron \nWB-500D), a fixing device, and a specimen, as shown in Fig.  1(c). The heat bath on the left side served as the \nsource applied to the specimen, whereas the heat bath on the right side, filled with an ice–water mixture, was \nused as the heat sink. The specimen was assembled into 4 × 4 unit-cell thermal shifters composed of copper and \nepoxy, with 4 × 4 rotating squares serving as the base connected with joints, as shown in Fig.  1(d1),(d2), and \n(d3). The design of joints connecting the rotating squares in the present study is illustrated in Supplementary \nFigure S2. In addition, the assembled specimen was connected to the thin copper plate with 0.3 mm thickness at \neach end. We polished the interfaces of the unit-cell thermal shifters and added the thermal compound (Cooler \nMaster RG-ICF-CWR2-GP) (Thermal conductivity k = 1W/(mK), from the product sheet provided by the man-\nufacturer) in between adjacent unit cells to reduce the thermal resistance. As illustrated in Fig. 1(c), the temper-\nature profile on the topside of the specimen was obtained through a calibrated IR camera, with a thin coating of \nhigh-emissivity (ε = 0.94) black acrylic paint, ART-ANDREA-S-72075801, applied on the topside for accurate \nthermal imaging.\nNumerical simulations of MMT-based TCC. The results of the theoretical model are summarized in \nFig. 2(a). Figure  2(a1,a2)  illustrate the simulated temperature profile and isothermal lines of the theoretical \nmodel, respectively, with the red arrows indicating the directions of the heat flux. The simulation revealed the \nproperties of the proposed TCC, where no external distortion existed and no internal gradient was observed (no \nheat flux through the inner region). After the specimen was rotated 90°, no external distortion existed, but a much \ngreater internal gradient was observed (with greater heat flux through the inner region), as shown in Fig. 2(a1,a2).\nFigure 2(b1,b2) present the temperature profile and isothermal line of the TCC, respectively. An annular ring \nof the theoretical model was plotted to clarify the difference between the theoretical and effective models. As illus-\ntrated in Fig. 2(b1), the temperature inside the annular ring was almost constant, with the isothermal lines outside \nthe annular ring exhibiting minimal disturbance, similar to the properties displayed by a thermal cloak. As shown \nin Fig. 2(b2), the model rotated 90°, demonstrating the ability to guide the heat flux into the inner region of the \nannular ring, thus causing more temperature variations inside the annular ring and a slight disturbance outside \nthe ring.\nThe preceding results show that the proposed MMT-based TCC can control the gradient within a particular \nregion. However, it is reasonable to question whether such an ability can still exist when the radiation heat loss as \nwell as the thermal resistance in the contact interfaces are considered. To explore this question numerically, in the \nfinal case we applied a surface-to-ambient radiation boundary condition in COMSOL; that is \nεσ=− TTQ( )ua mb\n44 , where Q is the thermal energy leaving the surface, εu = 0.94 is the emissivity of the surface, \nσ is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant, and Tamb = 28.9 °C is the ambient temperature. To compare the experimental \nresults, the revised effective model and the experimental specimen were constructed as similar as possible. For the \nrevised model, we simultaneously simulated the thermal radiation with the thermal resistance due to the contact \ninterface (see Supplementary Section 1) and concluded that the temperature profile along y 0=  when setting \nk = 0.5 W/(mK) is closest to that of the experimental data. Figure 2(c1,c2) show the simulated temperature profile \nand isothermal lines of the revised effective model, respectively. The isothermal lines detoured around the inner \nregion in the model rotated 0°, and were compressed into the inner region in the model rotated 90°. Clearly, when \nthe radiation heat loss was considered, the prominent control of the gradient within the inner region varied when \nrotated either 0° or 90°.\nExperimental validation of MMT-based TCC. The steady-state temperature profile of the specimen was \nthen measured using the IR camera, and the results of which are shown in Fig.  2(d1,d2). The temperature of \nthe inner region was almost constant, as shown in Fig.  2(d1), but it changed drastically, as shown in Fig. 2(d2). \nHowever, owing to heat loss to the surrounding area, the overall temperature was lower near the right side of the \nspecimen, which was determined to be consistent with the revised model in Fig. 2. Comparisons of the theoreti-\ncal, effective, revised model, and experimental results of the TCC are discussed further.\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n3\nScientific  REPORTs  |  (2018) 8:2493  | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-20753-y\nDiscussion\nFirst, the theoretical and effective models of the TCC, along with the revised model and the experimental results, \nare discussed. From Fig. 2, the temperature along y  = 0 in all model types and experimental results can be plotted, \nas shown in Fig. 3, in which the broken lines indicate the inner region of the TCC. We noted that the effective \nmodel was consistent with the theoretical model, as shown in both Fig.  3(a1,b1). This means that the proposed \nMMT-based TCC is equivalent to the theoretical model deduced from transformation thermodynamics. \nHowever, the overall temperature in the experimental results was lower than that observed in the effective model, \nas shown in both Fig. 3(a1,b1). This implies a loss of heat into the ambient. Furthermore, the thermal interfacial \nFigure 1. Schematic of numerical simulation and experimental setup.

We noted that the performance of cloaking improved when the device had a small value of m; \nmoreover, a large value of m indicated better performance for the concentrator. As illustrated in Fig. 3(a2), when \nthe device was rotated 0°, the m value was 0 for the theoretical model, 0.26 for the effective model, and 0.24 for the \nrevised model, whereas the measured result was 0.29. Because the overall temperature was lower in the revised \nFigure 2. (a1), (b1), (c1), and (d1), and (a2), (b2), (c2), and (d2) depict simulated temperature profiles and \nisothermal lines of the theoretical, effective, and revised models and the measured temperature profiles of the \nTCC, respectively, with red arrows indicating the heat flux through the model in 0° rotation (90° rotation). \nThe applied fixed temperature is shown on the color bar, and the annular rings represent the geometry of the \ntheoretical model and the square lines represent the effective model (The Celsius scale is used for the unit of \ntemperature).\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n5\nScientific  REPORTs  |  (2018) 8:2493  | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-20753-y\nmodel and experiment, the m value of the revised model was lower than that of the effective model. However, due \nto thermal interfacial resistance of the thermal compound and rough contact interfaces, a sudden drop in temper-\nature occurred at x 05=. , causing a slight increase in m. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 3(b2), when the device \nwas rotated 90°, the m value was 1.94 for the theoretical model, 2.06 for the effective model, and 1.76 for the \nrevised model, whereas the measured result was 1.51. Notably, the gradient of the effective model was even greater \nthan that of the theoretical model, a result caused by the fact that the inner region of the theoretical model was \ncomposed of background material which had no ability to concentrate the heat. Moreover, the thermal resistance \nof unit-cell thermal shifters resulted in a lower m value, compared with the revised model.\nThe effect of the modulation of the temperature range and the surrounding temperature due to radiation was \nnumerically examined. Specifically, the 0° rotated TCC was investigated. First, the surrounding temperature in \nthe model was fixed at 25 °C, and the modulation of the temperature range was varied. The simulation results, as \nshown in Fig. 4(a), reveals that the overall normalized temperature in the cloaking zone decreases when the sur-\nrounding temperature is close to the lower-bound temperature (See the case: 10 °C ~25 °C~50 °C), and vice versa. \nThe normalized temperature profile along \ny  = 0, however, behaves similarly as the surrounding temperature and \nthe modulation of the temperature range have the same deviation. (Fig. 4(b)).\nFigure 3. (a1) and (b1) present temperature along =y 0 of simulated and experimental results in both 0° and \n90° rotated TCCs, where broken lines indicate the inner region of the TCC. The gradient within line segment bc \nover the applied gradient is plotted in (a2) and (b2) for clearer observation.\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n6\nScientific  REPORTs  |  (2018) 8:2493  | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-20753-y\nFor application considerations, the unit cells of the inner region of the effective model in the simulation were \nremoved, and the number of unit-cell thermal shifters is discussed in this section. The temperature along y  = 0 is \nshown in Fig. 5, in which the broken line indicates the inner region of the TCC. In the device rotated 0°, we noted \nthat when the number of unit cells increased, the gradient within the inner region decreased, as shown in \nFig. 5(a1); by contrast, in the device rotated 90°, the gradient increased as the number of unit cells increased, as \nshown in Fig.  5(b2). For ease of comprehension, Table  1 shows the gradient within line segment bc over the \napplied gradient, m. We observed that the ability to change the gradient internally was below the expected level in \nthe 3 × 3 unit cell-based TCC, because the number of unit cells in the model was insufficient for the anisotropic \nthermal conductivity to be deduced from transformation thermodynamics. However, once the number of unit \nFigure 4.

Moreover, the \nisothermal distortion of the exterior of the device can be observed in Fig. 5(a2,b2) and Fig. 6(a1,a2,b1,b2,c1,c2). \nThe isothermal distortion was observed to decrease when the number of unit-cell thermal shifters increased in \nboth 0° and 90° rotated TCCs.\nConclusion\nBy combining rotating squares with auxetic property, we proposed the use of thermal metamaterials with tunable \nfunctionalities. An MMT-based TCC, which can change from a cloak to a concentrator when the device config-\nuration is transformed, was then investigated. The MMT-based TCC can thermally protect a region and enable \na concentrator to focus heat flux in a small region, and this was verified in both simulations and experiments.\nIn summary, the proposed MMT-based TCC could control the gradient within the inner region in both the \ntheoretical and the effective models. However, this ability was slightly suppressed when the radiation heat loss \nconsidered, which is reasonable given that the transformation thermodynamics is based on the theory of heat \nconduction. However, the contact interface of the thermal shifters should be sufficiently smooth to minimize \nthermal interfacial resistance. Additionally, for application considerations, we removed the unit cells of the region \nwithin the device and found that the greater the number of unit cells, the better the ability to control the gradient \nwithin the device (and vice versa). Furthermore, when the number of thermal shifters was sufficient, we observed \nonly a small amount of isothermal distortion outside the device. With such functionality to control the gradient \ninternally, the proposed TCC can be used for thermal protection of a heat-sensitive device or as a thermal con-\ncentration application within a given region.\nMethods\nIn this study, we adapted effective medium theory to construct the unit-cell thermal shifters. The theoretical and \neffective models of a unit-cell thermal shifter are illustrated in Supplementary Figure S4. The effective thermal \nconductivity of the composite was fabricated by alternately stacking two sheets of thermal conductivities and can \nbe obtained by Bandaru\n35 as follows:\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\nk k0\n0k (1)\nEMT\np\ns\nwhere =\n+\n+kp\nkl kl\nll\n11 22\n12\n is the parallel thermal conductivity, as shown inFig. 7(a), and ks\nkk ll\nlk lk\n()12 12\n12 21\n=\n+\n+\n is the thermal \nconductivity in series, as shown in Fig. 7(b). The effective thermal conductivity of the composite rotated in the x-y \nplane by θ can be given as follows:\nk Jk TransJ\nJ\n()\ndet( )( 2)EMT\nEMT= ⋅′\nwhere J is the Jacobian for the rotation, and Trans(J) denotes the transpose of J. Using the equation (2 ), we can \nobtain the effective thermal conductivity of the thermal shifters composed of alternately stacking two sheets of \nthermal conductivities rotated by θ, as shown in Fig. 7(c).\nHowever, for the fabrication of thermal metamaterials using the assembly concept, the contact interface \nbetween thermal shifters will change the effective thermal conductivity of the thermal shifters. Therefore, the \neffective thermal conductivity of the thermal shifters with contact interface must be derived. Using the equation \n(2), we can obtain the following:\nk Jk TransJ\nJ\n()\ndet( )\nkk\nkk (3)\nEMT\nEMT px y\nxy s\n′= =\n\n\n\n′\n′\n\n\n\nwhere kk kk sins inpp sp\n22θθ′= −+ , kxy = −(sin2θ(kp−ks))/2, and θθ′= +−kk kk sins insp ss\n22 . We then use the \nsame technique in deriving the equation (1 ). First, we consider the thermal shifter surrounded by the contact \ninterface as a unit cell, and then divide the contact interface into four segments, as shown in Fig. 7(d).

According to Gueeanu4, the anisotropic thermal conductivity of a thermal cloak \nis given as follow:\n′=\n\n\n\n\n\n′−\n′\n′\n′−\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrR\nr\nr\nrR\nkk\n0\n0\n(6)\n1\n1\nwhere r′=R1+r (R2 − R1)/R2, and R1 and R2 are the inner radius and outer radius of the cloak, respectively. First, \nwe let R2/R1 = 4 and =R 70 22 mm; thus, the length of the thermal shifter is 35 mm. Substituting these values \ninto the equation (6), we obtain the following:\n′=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\nk\nr\nr\nr\nr\nk\n3\n37 02\n0\n0 37 02\n3( 7)\nWe then discretize the thermal cloak into 4 × 4 unit-cell thermal shifters, as shown in Fig. 8(a1–a3). Subsequently, \nthe equation (7) can be expressed in Cartesian coordinates as follows:\nθθ θθ\nθθ θθ\n′=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n +\n\n\n\n\n +\n\n\n\n\n+ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+ −\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+ −\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n +\n\n\n\n\n +\n\n\n\n+ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nk\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\nr\nk\n3\n37 02\ncos 37 02\n3\nsin 37 02\n3\n3\n37 02\ncoss in\n37 02\n3\n3\n37 02\ncoss in 3\n37 02\nsin 37 02\n3\ncos\n(8)\nC\n22\n22\nBy substituting each center coordinate of the thermal shifters into the preceding equation, we obtain the \ndesired thermal conductivity of each thermal shifter (See Supplementary Table S1).\nAccordingly, we could obtain the required arrangement of each unit-cell thermal shifter by substituting the \nthermal conductivity in Supplementary Table S1 into the equation (5 ). The preceding task should be consid-\nered an optimization problem, which involves determining all the parameters in the equation (5 ) to obtain an \noptimum solution. In this instance, the unit cell thermal shifters in the thermal cloak are composed of layered, \nFigure 8. Design principle and anisotropic thermal conductivity of discretized thermal cloak.

Hence, we let k 1 = 400W/mK, k2 = 0.3W/mK, d = 1 mm, and L = 35 mm in the equation (5 ) for \nmanufacturing consideration, leaving only L1, L2, and θ to be determined. For the chosen parameter, the current \noptimization problem is subject to the following box constraints:\nl27 ,u 1, ,N (9)constraints\nu\n11\n()≤∅ =≤ =…\nl27 ,u 1, ,N (10)constraints\nu\n22\n()≤∅ =≤ =…\n/2 /2,u 1, ,N (11)constraints\nu\n3\n()πθ π−≤ ∅= ≤= …\nBy solving the preceding optimization problem, we can obtain the exact parameters described in the equations \n(9)–(11) (See Supplementary Table S2). As a consequence of the optimal parameters shown in Supplementary \nTable S2, the effective thermal conductivity varies inside the different unit-cell thermal shifters, as shown in \nFig. 8(b1–b3), and is generally anisotropic.\nTo obtain the anisotropic thermal conductivity of the MMT-based TCC, we rotated the thermal conductivity \nin the equation (6) by 90°, identical to the angle rotated by the unit cell of rotating squares relative to each other \n(the tunable mechanism of the MMT-based TCC is displayed in Supplementary). Thus, we obtain the following:\nk\nJk TransJ\nJ\n()\ndet( ) (12)\nTheory=\n⋅\nψ\nψψ\nψ\nwhere\nJ cos( )s in()\nsin()c os() ,0 or 90\n(13)\n00= \n\n\nψψ\n−ψ ψ\n\n\n\n ψ=\nψ\nIn the equations (12) and (13), when the rotating angle, ψ , is 0°, kψ is the anisotropic thermal conductivity \nof the thermal cloak. However, when the rotating angle is 90°, k ψ is the anisotropic thermal conductivity of the \nthermal concentrator. Hence, for other MMT-based thermal metamaterials with tunable functionalities, the ani-\nsotropic thermal conductivity can be obtained using the coordinate transformation technique, which involves \nrotating the original thermal conductivity by 90°.\nData availability statement.
