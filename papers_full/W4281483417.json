The contradiction has become quite intense between\ntraditional energy supply and the increasing demand for energy in the development of the global\neconomy (Lu et al., 2022). To alleviate the dependence on traditional energy sources, bridge the gap\nbetween electricity supply and demand, and reduce environmental pollution, more and more\nEdited by:\nXueqian Fu,\nChina Agricultural University, China\nReviewed by:\nCongcong Pan,\nChongqing University, China\nXinmiao Ding,\nShandong Institute of Business and\nTechnology, China\nXuguo Jiao,\nQingdao Technological University,\nChina\n*Correspondence:\nWende Ke\nkewd@sustech.edu.cn\nSpecialty section:\nThis article was submitted to\nSmart Grids,\na section of the journal\nFrontiers in Energy Research\nReceived: 25 March 2022\nAccepted: 19 April 2022\nPublished: 25 May 2022\nCitation:\nWang J, Zhang X, Zhang F, Wan J,\nKou L and Ke W (2022) Review on\nEvolution of Intelligent Algorithms for\nTransformer Condition Assessment.\nFront.

In\naddition, the third industrial revolution represented by new\nenergy technology ( IEEE-SA Standards Board IEEE Std\nC57104-2019, 2019) and energy internet technology is on the\nrise, and the power network has evolved from local small-scale\nnetworks to cross-regional interconnected power grids (Li et al.,\n2022a). Hence, it is imperative to ensure the safety, reliability, and\nhigh efﬁciency of power grids (Li et al., 2022b).\nAs smart grid technology thrives rapidly, power transformers\nare playing an increasingly signiﬁcant role in power systems.\nHowever, transformer defects and failures may be caused by\noverload, overvoltage, internal insulation aging, and the natural\nenvironment, which will not only lead to huge economic losses\nand affect the daily lives of power consumers but also inﬂuence\npublic safety and cause serious social losses (Malhara and Vittal,\n2010; Miranda et al., 2012; Gang et al., 2014; Li et al., 2016a).\nConventional periodic maintenance (e.g., preventive\nmaintenance) has been over-estimated because the time-based\nstrategy may fail when faults cannot be detected during the time\nintervals between planned maintenance periods (Trappey et al.,\n2015). In such cases, condition-based maintenance (CBM) is\nnecessary, which can support proactive maintenance, alter\nscheduled maintenance, prolong the service life, and reduce\nmaintenance costs, thus making maintenance work more\nscientiﬁc( Wang et al., 2015 ). CBM strategies are jointly\ndetermined by condition monitoring (Kou et al., 2022) and\nassessment. Therefore, in order to prevent undesirable failures\nand defects, it is important to keep monitoring and evaluating the\noperating condition of power transformers, grasp the rules of\ntheir operation state, and provide suggestions for transformer\ncondition maintenance and asset management (Saha et al., 2015).\nTo this end, there is an increasing need for better non-intrusive\ndiagnostic and monitoring techniques to evaluate the overall\noperating condition of the transformers (Wang et al., 2002).\nAt present, condition assessment for power transformers\nmainly analyzes and judges the health condition mainly through\none or a few state parameters and uniﬁed diagnostic criteria (Sheng\net al., 2018; Wu et al., 2020), which fails to comprehensively take\nadvantage of defects, maintenance history, family quality history,\netc. The thresholds are determined by statistical analysis of a great\ndeal of experimental data and subjective experience. Moreover,\ntransformer state information is scattered in various business\napplication systems and is characterized by a complex and\ndiverse structure as well as uneven quality. As a result, it is\ndifﬁcult to obtain transformer data integration, an accurate\ndescription of the fault or defect evolution, as well as associated\nrules between the transformer state parameters. The accuracy,\npertinence, and timeliness of the diagnosis and evaluation\nresults may differ from the actual operation and maintenance of\npower transformers (Wu et al., 2021). Hence, it is signiﬁcantly\nnecessary to exploit new techniques to optimize and improve the\nexisting research structure for transformer condition assessment\nand further beneﬁt attempts for CBM and asset management.\nIn the last decade, various power utilities, research institutions,\nequipment-operating units, and manufacturers have striven to\ndevelop emerging technologies, such as big data, cloud\ncomputing, Internet of Things, mobile Internet, and artiﬁcial\nintelligence, which are widely applied to power grids. These new\ntechnologies can promote rule mining among transformer-operating\ninformation, environmental data, and power grid operation data. As\nfor operation and maintenance of power transformers, advanced\nmeasurement infrastructures have been deployed in smart grids, and\ntransformer state data has gradually emerged as large-volume, multi-\ntype, and fast-growing, thus paving the way for the application and\ndevelopment of big data, arti ﬁcial intelligence, and other\ntechnologies in transformer condition assessment. Hence,\nintegrating intelligent algorithms into big data and knowledge\nanalysis is valuable for transformation condition assessment.\nUntil now, several methods for transformer condition assessment\nhave been applied to the theoretical investigation and various\nresearch (Flores et al., 2011; Liao et al., 2011; Arias Velasquez\nand Mejia Lara, 2018; Zhou and Hu, 2020). At the same time,\nseveral surveys on transformer condition assessment have been\ncarried out from different perspectives (Wang et al., 2020a). A\nvariety of condition monitoring methods and diagnostic tests\nwere investigated in (Wang et al., 2002), (Islam et al., 2018a)a n d\n(Xie et al., 2020), including dissolved gas analysis (DGA), tap\nchanger condition, frequency response analysis, insulation\nresistance measurements, partial discharge, turns ratio, oil testing,\nand power factor.De Faria et al. (2015) reviewed operational lifetime\ndegradation factors and the major techniques employed for\npredictive maintenance based on DGA. In addition, the\nDoernenburg, Rogers, IEC ratio, Duval triangle, and key gas\nmethods were introduced in detail (Faiz and Soleimani, 2017).\nBakar et al. (2014) presented several methods for measuring the\nconcentrations of dissolved gases in transformer oil and provided\nseveral interpretations of DGA.Singh and Verma (2008) presented\nan overview of transformer fault diagnosis (Shi et al., 2009)b a s e do n\nAI techniques, including fuzzy logic, neural networks, and neuro-\nfuzzy-based expert systems. Time-domain polarization\nmeasurements and physicochemical-based diagnostic techniques\nwere investigated respectively in (Saha, 2003)a n d( Sylvestre\nN’cho et al., 2016) to assess the insulation condition in aged\ntransformers. Since the health index well reﬂected the health and\noperating condition of transformers,Azmi et al. (2017)e x a m i n e dt h e\nprevious mathematical equation/algorithm of the health index in\nterms of combination of scoring, scoring, and ranking method,\nranking and tier method, multi-featured factor assessment model,\nand matrices.Wang et al. (2020b) provided a comprehensive review\nof the existing work for transformers from two perspectives,\nincluding fault diagnosis and operating condition prediction.\nHowever, none of the previous work has been dedicated to a\ncomprehensive survey of intelligent algorithms applied in\ntransformer condition assessment, considering the intelligent\ndemands of the tasks in each stage of condition assessment\nunder big data. To this end, this article aims to provide a\nuniformed framework for transformer condition assessment,\nfrom data acquisition, data processing, and data analysis to\nvisual application, to cope with various patterns of transformer\nfailures and tackle the intelligent demands of big data analysis.\nMoreover, various data acquisition modules, data system, and the\nrelevant data types with respect to transformer condition\nFrontiers in Energy Research | www.frontiersin.org May 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 9041092\nWang et al. Review on Transformer Condition Assessment\nassessment are explored in detail. Furthermore, the intelligent\nalgorithms applied in data analysis for transformer condition\nassessment are exhaustively reviewed in this article. The main\ncontributions can be summarized as follows:\n The statistical analysis of transformer failure locations and\ntypes is investigated. Moreover, the main factors related to\nthe operational condition of a power transformer and\noperating mechanism in the developing process of an\ninternal latent fault are comprehensively analyzed.\n To cope with various patterns of transformer failures and\ncomprehensively investigate large amount of transformer\nstat data, a uniformed framework for transformer condition\nassessment, from data acquisition, data processing, and data\nanalysis, to visual application, is proposed.\n The data acquisition and data types related to transformer\nstate are exhaustively investigated, and the basic concept\nrelated to transformer condition assessment is discussed.\n A holistic study of traditional condition assessment methods\nis presented, including rule-based method, information\nfusion method, and artiﬁcial intelligence method.\n In addition, the state-of-the-art efforts made in three\nestablished topics about transformer condition\nassessment are surveyed under big data, including\ndifferentiated evaluation, uncertainty evaluation, and big\ndata analysis.\nIn the following, the statistical analysis of transformer failures is\npresented in Section 2, including transformer failure locations,\nfailure types, and operating mechanism of latent fault.Section 3\ndiscusses the data source, concept, and architecture of transformer\ncondition assessment. Several traditional methods for transformer\ncondition assessment are investigated inSection 4. Section 5\nexplores the new ﬁndings related to transformer condition\nassessment. Finally, some possible further advancement is discussed.\n2 TRANSFORMER FAILURE STATISTICS\nAND ANALYSIS\nLarge power transformers are generally working under high\nvoltage, high current, suffering from wind, frost, rain, and snow,\netc. frequently, and the operating environment is harsh. Moreover,\nas operating time increases, the dielectric strength and mechanical\nstrength of transformer insulation materials decrease, which may\nincrease failure probability and reduce residual life (Su et al., 2022).\nAccording to the 1983 CIGRE working group’s statistics of large-\nscale transformer failure records with a service life of less than\n20 years from 1968 to 1978, the order of transformer failure\nlocations is generally on-load tap-changer, winding, bushing,\ntank, core, and relay, as shown inFigure 1 (Bossi et al., 1983).\nAs shown in Figure 2, power transformers are extremely\ncomplex systems, involving circuits, magnetic circuits,\ninsulation, and mechanical mechanisms ( Xiao et al., 2022 ).\nThey are subject to a variety of internal and external stresses\n(electrical, magnetic, mechanical, and thermal) and inﬂuence\nfactors. The inner insulation condition is affected by the\nmulti-ﬁeld coupled working environment, such as electric\nﬁeld, magnetic ﬁeld, and temperatureﬁeld. The water content,\nimpurities, defects, and other factors will also affect inner\ninsulation and safe operation of transformers. At the same\ntime, external factors (e.g., strong lightning strikes ( Chen\net al., 2021a ), corrosive gases, current and load impact\ngenerated by power grid operation, monitoring information\ntransmission safety) could cause a major uncertainty in the\nsafe and reliable operation of transformers. The statistics of\ncommon transformer fault causes are shown in Figure 3\n(Xiang Zhang and Gockenbach, 2008).\nSince transformers have complicated structures and many\nfactors, the correlation of failure causes and components is not\nalways obvious, and some faults have characteristics of inductivity\nand compliance. That is, a fault may be caused by another fault,\nand it may induce the other faults. Even sometimes, a variety of\nfailures happen together; that is, faults have the characteristic of\nconcurrency. For example, when a short circuit accident occurs in\nthe power system, two or more faults such as deformation, solder\njoint breakage, or insulation damage occur simultaneously. The\nfundamental reason for transformer faults is that the internal\ninsulation (including solid insulating materials and insulating oil)\nof the transformer has gradually decreased, which results in\ntransformer outages. At the same time, the harmonic in the\npower system network could increase transformer losses and\ncause an abnormal rise in temperature, which will decrease\nefﬁciency, insulation aging, and the expected lifetime\n(Henderson and Rose, 1994 ; Elmoudi et al., 2005; Elmoudi\net al., 2006 ). Transformer overload operation will lead to\ndecomposition of solid insulation materials and a large\namount of gas is generated, which affects its mechanical\nproperties, electrical properties, and insulation properties. The\ndevelopment mechanism is shown inFigure 4. Moreover, there\nexist complex relationships between transformers and other\npower equipment in electrical and informational aspects. It is\noften the case that clearly good assets and clearly bad assets are\ngiven appropriate scores, but it is the journey and rete of travel\nbetween two states that is of interest. Therefore, it is vitally\nimportant to accurately judge the operating condition and\ndetect the potential faults through modern electrical science,\ninformation science, data science, and mature system science\nmethods, which are also the key points of this article.\nFIGURE 1 |Defective components of a transformer (OLTC: on-load tap\nchanger).\nFrontiers in Energy Research | www.frontiersin.org May 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 9041093\nWang et al. Review on Transformer Condition Assessment\n3 OVERVIEW OF TRANSFORMER\nCONDITION ASSESSMENT\nThe degradation of most transformers, a changing, dynamic, and\nnon-linear process, begins from early defect, latent fault, or\ndeterioration to failure because of long-term bombinated\nstresses of “electric–magnetism–force–heat” and external\nenvironments. In an attempt to counterattack these undesirable\nsituations, it is imperative to assess the performance of\ntransformers according to the results of condition monitoring\n(Velasquez-Contreras et al., 2011 ). Considering that\ntransformers have an inherent complex structure, intricate\ndegradation mechanism, and variable operational conditions,\ntransformer condition assessment should not only integrate\nstate parameters and properties related to themselves and their\ncomponents, but also take into account environmental\ninformation, power grid operation, and so on. Only in this way\ncan the operational state of transformers be reﬂected and judged\nfrom different perspectives.\nThe goal of transformer condition assessment is to combine\nthe DGA, oil quality, furan content, and oil insulation as well as\ninspection observations in different subsystems, analyze the\ncorrelation of these state parameters, and obtain the health\nand operating condition of the power transformers based on\nstandards, algorithms, and expert knowledge (Rudin et al., 2012;\nChen et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2017). The assessment results can\nbe used to support condition monitoring decisions, maintenance\nplanning, and asset management.\n3.1 Flowchart of Transformer Condition\nAssessment\nThe overall structure of transformer condition assessment,“data\nacquisition— data processing and mining— comprehensive data\nanalysis— visual presentation of user demand,” is illustrated in\nFigure 5. Transformer condition assessment requires various\nstate parameters that can reﬂect the operating condition of a\npower transformer, such as DGA data, electrical testing data, oil\ntesting data, historical data, family defects, load, economic\ndispatch, and operating environment.\nAs depicted inFigure 5, multi-modal data processing involves\ntext mining, image recognition, and waveform analysis. After data\ncleaning, feature extraction, and data fusion, the assessment of the\nactual transformer operating condition is carried out from\ndifferent perspectives, such as feature recognition, anomaly\ndetection, fault diagnosis, and prediction (Kou et al., 2021),\nwhich can provide powerful economic and technical\njustiﬁcations for planned asset replacement, maintenance costs,\nand statistical analysis of family defects. In addition, as\ndetermined by the optimal balance among capital investment,\noperating maintenance, and asset maintenance cost, the\nmaintenance strategy includes monitoring, repair, maintaining,\nFIGURE 2 |Main factors related to transformer operation.\nFIGURE 3 |Transformer failure causes.\nFrontiers in Energy Research | www.frontiersin.org May 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 9041094\nWang et al. Review on Transformer Condition Assessment\nreplacing, or contingency control (Azmi et al., 2017). Thus,\ntransformer condition assessment is expected to bridge the\ncontradictions between the bene ﬁts of electricity power\nproduction and asset maintenance budgets.\n3.2 Data Source\nData is the basis for the transformer condition assessment. The\ndata required for the analysis of the transformer operating state\n(Figure 6) mainly comprise transformer operation attributes,\ninspection records, inspection, live detection, online\nmonitoring, system operation data, fault and defect records,\nmaintenance records, weather information, and so on. The data\nare scattered in each sub-business systems, including\nproduction management system (PMS), equipment condition\nmonitoring system, geographic information system (GIS),\nenergy management system (EMS), weather forecasting\nsystem, lightning location system, and mountain ﬁre/ice\nwarning system. According to different sources of\ntransformer state data, transformer condition information\ncan be divided into internal data (e.g., transformer operating\nand maintenance records, transformer online monitoring, and\nlive detection data, etc.) and external data (e.g., power grid\noperation data, and environmental meteorology\ninformation, etc.).\n4 TRADITIONAL METHODS FOR\nTRANSFORMER CONDITION\nASSESSMENT\nThe traditional methods for transformer condition assessment\nrepresent that these methods are widely used in assessing the\noperating condition of power transformers. Several common\ntransformer condition assessment methods can be classi ﬁed\ninto rule-based, information fusion-based, and arti ﬁcial\nintelligence-based methods.\nFIGURE 5 |Flowchart of transformer condition assessment.\nFIGURE 4 |Developing mechanism of a transformer’s internal latent fault.\nFrontiers in Energy Research | www.frontiersin.org May 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 9041095\nWang et al. Review on Transformer Condition Assessment\n4.1 Rule-Based Method\nDoernerburg, Rogers, modi ﬁed Rogers, Duval Triangle, IEC\n60599, and other DGA criteria interpretations (Trappey et al.,\n2015) were developed to evaluate the condition of oil and paper\ninsulation and detect faults indirectly from the gases. The IEEE\n(IEEE-SA Standards Board IEEE Std C57104-2019, 2019 ;\nIEEE-SA Standards Board IEEE Std C57106-2015, 2016 )\nguides classify DGA results into three types, including“DGA\nStatus 1” (low gas levels and no indication of gassing),“DGA\nStatus 2” (intermediate gas levels and/or possible gassing), and\n“DGA Status 3” (high gas levels and/or probable active gassing).\nIn addition, since IEEE and IEC (International Electrotechnical\nCommission IEC 60422-2013, 2013 ; International\nElectrotechnical Commission IEC 60567-2011, 2011) standards\nclassify the evaluation grade into “normal,”“ attention,”\n“abnormal,” and “serious,” the obtained results of transformer\nstate assessment are usually presented in the form of a state grade\nor health index (Naderian et al., 2008; Jahromi et al., 2009). Some\nother state parameters, such as interfacial tension, water content,\nand dielectric breakdown voltage, are judged by limited values for\ndifferent voltage classes.\nAlthough rule-based condition assessment is relatively simple,\neasy, and widely used, there are three problems facing existing\nstandards: 1) it is difﬁcult to apply the uniﬁed calculation model\nparameters, weightings and thresholds of the standards to\ndiversiﬁed transformers for different types, regions and\nmanufacturers; 2) the uncertain impacts of multiple data\nsources, degradation mechanisms, etc. are neglected; and 3)\nthe transformer evaluation process mainly relies on DGA data,\noil test and electrical test data.\n4.2 Information Fusion Method\nGiven that there are many state parameters related to power\ntransformers and the information obtained from a single sensor is\nincomplete, it is essential to combine different information from\nmultiple data sources to acquire an accurate description of the\nhealth and operating condition of power transformers. Moreover,\nmulti-source information fusion can enhance the viability of\ntransformer condition assessment and fault diagnosis (Li et al.,\n2009).\nThe existing research mainly concentrates on feature level\nfusion and decision level fusion. Li et al. represent different\naspects of the power transformer with an index based on\nDGA (HI\nCH), insulating paper health index (HIiso), main\nhealth index (HIm), and an index based on oil quality factor\n(HIoil). The weight of each index parameter was calculated\nthrough an analytic hierarchy process, and the ﬁnal HI was\nobtained by summing the weights of the four indexes ( En-\nWen and Bin, 2014 ). Cui et al. (2016 ) proposed using a\nBayesian Network (BN) based multisource data and\ninformation fusion method to assess the overall health\ncondition of a transformer. Li et al. (2018 ) established a\nhierarchical Bayesian belief network to calculate a probabilistic\nhealth index and then assessed the operational state of power\ntransformers. The method comprises four layers, which are index\nlayer, component layer, factor layer, and data layer.Islam et al.\n(2018b) studied the long-term degradation of different\nsubsystems, such as tap changer condition operations,\nimpurity analysis, insulation condition, bushing condition,\ninternal components, and other parameters, and then\ncombined them into a condition-based HI score. Moreover,\nthe maintenance history and loading information were\nconsidered. In terms of policy-making level fusion, Ma et al.\n(2011) adopted Bayesian fusion and Dempster–Shafer fusion to\nintegrate the diagnosis results obtained from the conventional\ndiagnosis algorithm, utility practices, predictive learning\nalgorithm, and expert judgments. The detailed investigation of\nadvantages and limitations is illustrated inTable 1.\nTo sum up, these methods only consider part of the state\nparameters. If there exists a big difference in different assessment\nlayers, it is liable to lead to misleading assessment results.\nMeanwhile, there is little research on data-level fusion from\nthe perspective of data science for transformer condition\nassessment.\nFIGURE 6 |Transformer data collection and classiﬁcation.\nFrontiers in Energy Research | www.frontiersin.org May 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 9041096\nWang et al. Review on Transformer Condition Assessment\n4.3 Artiﬁcial Intelligence Method\nOwning to the artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) technologies with robust\ncapacity in feature extraction and classi ﬁcation, several AI\nmethods such as, artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) (Illias et al.,\n2016), fuzzy logic (Flores et al., 2011) support vector machine\n(SVM) (Li et al., 2016b), and deep belief network (DBN) (Dai\net al., 2017 ) were introduced into transformer condition\nassessment and fault diagnosis. The detailed investigations of\nartiﬁcial intelligence methods are shown inTable 2. The pre-\ndetermined DGA gas content and existing DGA ratios (Roger\nratios, IEC ratios, etc.) are used as input parameters of AI models\n(Zhang et al., 2021). Li et al. proposed classifying different fault\ntypes of power transformers by the use of a genetic algorithm\n(GA) and SVM (Li et al., 2016b). Dai et al. adopted the DBN to\nreﬂect the mathematical correlation between dissolved gas ratios\nand transformer faults (Dai et al., 2017). Flores et al. put forward\nthe type-2 fuzzy logic system for assessing the condition of the\npaper-oil insulation (Flores et al., 2011).\nGiven that some gas ratios are not capable of transformer fault\ndiagnosis, some researchers adopt GA (Jahromi et al., 2009; Sahri\nand Yusof, 2015), particle swarm optimization (PSO) (Lee et al.,\n2007), rough set (RS) (Zang and Yu, 2009; Zhi-bin, 2012), and\nprincipal component analysis (PCA) (Trappey et al., 2015; Kari\nand Gao, 2017) to select optimal DGA ratios and eliminate\nredundant DGA ratios that affect the correct rate of fault\ndiagnosis, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of\ntransformer fault diagnosis results. Although these arti ﬁcial\nintelligence methods have achieved better accuracy, they\nrequire large amounts of sample data and expert experience\nand a great deal of time for computation, which is not\npractical in the actual electrical equipment evaluation. The\nfollowing are the speci ﬁc drawbacks for these methods: 1)\noverlooking the differences of the transformer under different\noperating environments; 2) neglecting the uncertainty of the\ncomplex nature of the transformer, data sources, uncertain\nvariables in the health condition assessment models; 3) facing\ngreat difﬁculties in heterogeneous data fusion and correlation\nanalysis because power transformer data has typical big data\ncharacteristics.\n5 EVALUATION OF INTELLIGENT\nALGORITHMS FOR TRANSFORMER\nCONDITION ASSESSMENT\nWith the development of online monitoring techniques, cyber-\nphysical systems, and the Internet of Things, the obtained\ntransformer data also has characteristics of big data. Therefore,\nit is indispensable to explore newﬁndings that can facilitate the\noperating condition analysis of transformers and tackle the\nTABLE 1 |Investigations of the information fusion method.\nAuthor Year Method Used state\nparameter\nAdvantage Limitation\nLi et al.

Review on Transformer Condition Assessment\nchallenges of big data analysis for transformer condition\nassessment. Therefore, this section summarizes the more\nrecent literature on intelligent algorithms for transformer\ncondition assessment.\nIn particular, a brief elaboration of the differences between\ntraditional methods and the evolution of intelligent algorithms is\npresented. The traditional methods depend on the IEC and IEEE\nstandards, which classify the state grade into “normal,”\n“attention,”“ abnormal,” and “serious.” Furthermore, the\nobtained results of transformer condition assessment usually\nappear in the form of a state grade or health index (Naderian\net al., 2008; Jahromi et al., 2009). Although traditional methods\nare relatively simple, easy, and widely used, there are three\nproblems with existing standards, including: 1) it is difﬁcult to\napply the uniﬁed calculation model parameters, weightings, and\nthresholds of the standards to diversi ﬁed transformers for\ndifferent types, regions, and manufacturers; 2) the uncertain\nimpacts of different data sources, degradation mechanisms,\netc., are not considered; and 3) these methods cannot\ncomprehensively explore and make the best of large amounts\nof state data with respect to the operating condition of\ntransformers.\nTo sum up, compared with the traditional condition\nassessment methods based on guides, information fusion, and\nartiﬁcial intelligence, the evolution of intelligent algorithms has\nthe following four characteristics:\n quickly extracting key state parameters;\n effectively mining the universality and individuality of the\ntransformer to achieve differentiated assessment of the\ntransformer state;\n deeply excavating the association relation and evolution rule\nbetween the transformer fault and state parameter;\n involving a data-driven evaluation process, which not only\neffectively avoids the interference of human factors but\nenhances the objectivity of the evaluation results.\n5.1 Differentiated Evaluation\nIn general, the threshold comparison method is usually used to\ncompare the monitored value of the state quantity with the preset\nthreshold in condition assessment, and the operating state of the\ntransformer is merely classiﬁed into healthy and non-healthy\ndepending on whether the thresholds are deviated from the preset\nvalues. This method is so ambiguous that it is not conducive to\nmaintenance decisions. In addition, the preset threshold in the\nabove method is usually based on other countries’ threshold\ncorrections. However, transformers in different countries have\ngreat differences in voltage level, processing technology, and\noperating environment (Qi et al., 2020). Moreover, thresholds\nare divided for different types of devices, and the threshold\npartitioning method is rough, which leads to the evaluation\nresults being too rough and the accuracy not being high. It is\ndifﬁcult to achieve a differentiated and reﬁned evaluation of\ntransformers of different types and regions. Therefore, this\npart will attempt to give an overview of existing research\nresults with respect to differentiated evaluation.\nThe DGA diagnostic standard of the State Grid Corporation of\nChina is“DL/T 722 Guide to the Analysis and Diagnosis of Gas\nDissolve in Transformer Oil” (STATE GRID Corporation of\nChina DL/T722-2014, 2014), which is established based on the\nrecommended values in IEEE standards and IEC 60599. IEC\n60599 (International Electrotechnical Commission IEC 60599-\n2015, 2015 ) collected a large amount of the global gas\nconcentration data, which covered the different individual\nvalves observed worldwide and surveyed by IEC and CIGRE.\nThere were great differences between foreign transformers, such\nas voltage level, manufacturer, operating and loading practices,\nand climate. The attention values and absolute gas production\nrates of the volume fraction of H\n2 (hydrogen), C2H2 (acetylene),\ntotal hydrocarbons, CO, and CO2 were provided in the DL/T 722\nGuide. However, the voltage level was merely classiﬁed into\n“above 330 kV” and “below 220 kV,” which failed to provide\nwarning thresholds for all dissolved gases of the power\ntransformer under different voltages.\nThese issues also exist in the condition assessment of the\npower transformer. Therefore, several countries adopt different\nmethods for parameter threshold determination. The\nUnited States and the United Kingdom calculate the threshold\nvalues depending on voltage level classiﬁcation. Germany takes\nthe inﬂuence of operating years and voltages into consideration.\nJapan presents the threshold values according to the equipment\nrated capacity and voltage level (DUVAL M., 2004). The statistics\non fault rate and defects of transformers from three different\nvoltage grades of 110 kV, 220 kV, and 500 kV (Zhang et al., 2015)\nshowed that the distribution model of dissolved gas composition\nand gas production rate accorded with the Weibull distribution,\nand the attention values and alarm values of each gas were\nobtained by the inverse cumulative distribution function. The\nﬁeld experience data demonstrated that the calculated attention\nvalues and alarm values were more suitable for the actual\noperation and maintenance. Qi et al. (Qi et al., 2020) obtained\nmeticulous and personalized warning results for power\ntransformers with different properties and operating\nconditions by investigating the differentiated warning rules.\nAttentional and alarming values under different operating\nages, voltage levels, and oil types were calculated and veriﬁed\nby the actual data. The extensive veriﬁcation showed that both the\ngas concentration and gas increase rate conformed to the Weibull\ndistribution with an accuracy rate of 98.21%.\nIn this context, it is urgent to achieve the differentiated\nwarning values of dissolved gases and other state parameters\nof diversi ﬁed transformers with different properties and\noperating environments, and classify more detailed\ntransformer state information for elaborated and personalized\ncondition monitoring and health condition assessment.\n5.2 Uncertainty Evaluation\nPower transformers are complex systems that contain many\ncomponents with different state parameters related to the\ntransformers. The relationships between state parameters and\noperational state are complicated and invisible. For example, the\namount of any gas generated in a transformer is expected to be\naffected by the duration of use, loading, thermal history, the\nFrontiers in Energy Research | www.frontiersin.org May 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 9041098\nWang et al. Review on Transformer Condition Assessment\nduration of any faults, the presence of one or more faults, and\nexternal factors such as voltage surges (Mirowski and LeCun,\n2012). Transformer condition assessment is a process of\ncombining multiple data sources and obtaining a speci ﬁc\nhealth grade for operation and maintenance planning. There is\ninherent ambiguous and uncertain information in transformer\ncondition assessment. Therefore, this part aims to provide a\nliterature review for previous works with respect to\nuncertainty evaluation.\nThe uncertainty during transformer condition assessment is\nderived from four aspects: 1) the complex nature of the\ntransformer, including its structure, degradation mechanism,\nand defect development law (Aizpurua et al., 2019a); 2) data\nsources and expert knowledge such as error-prone\nmeasurements; 3) uncertain variables in condition assessment\nmodels such as the selection and weight of health index, and the\nambiguous reﬂection between the health grade and transformer\nconditions (Liao et al., 2011; Aizpurua et al., 2021); and 4)\nexternal factors such as the operating environment, the\noperation of power grids, and the incorporation of\nintermittent renewable energy and applications (e.g.,\nphotovoltaic solar power generation, electric vehicles, wind\nenergy) (Mirowski and LeCun, 2012).\nThe data sources and expert knowledge of uncertainty directly\ninﬂuence theﬁnal transformer health state evaluation.Aizpurua\net al. (2019a) combined the different sources of expert knowledge\nto infer the conﬁdence intervals of transformer health condition\nfor decision-making under uncertainty. Given that the winding\nhotspot temperature (HST) was inferred from indirect\nmeasurements, a Bayesian inference framework was proposed\nin Aizpurua et al. (2019b), quantifying the uncertainty-informed\nremaining useful life (RUL) and analyzing the impacts of\ntemperature and load measurement errors on RUL prediction.\nDey et al. (2010) utilized the uncertainty envelope to eliminate\nnoise in dielectric response measurements for transformer\ncondition monitoring. Ma et al. (2010 ) took DGA and\ndepolarization current as examples to demonstrate the\ndifﬁculties in obtaining diagnosis conclusions under\nmeasurement-originating uncertainty and developed a SVM\nalgorithm to deal with any measurement-originating\nuncertainties.\nOther research mainly concentrates on uncertainty-based\nmethods, such as Dempster –Shafer evidence theory ( Akbari\net al., 2010), Bayesian network (Li et al., 2018), matter element\ntheory (Liang et al., 2013), and rough set (Tang et al., 2004; Chen\nand Yang, 2014 ), which can effectively combine key state\nparameter sets and provide a soft decision for transformer\ncondition assessment. On the other hand, some scholars adopt\nthe fuzzy theory (Sun et al., 2016), cloud theory (Liao et al., 2014),\nset pair theory (Li et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2018) and other uncertain\nreasoning methods to deal with uncertainty conversion between\nqualitative concepts and quantitative representations, which\navoid absolute boundaries of evaluation criteria to a certain\nextent.\nFuture research should focus on combining multiple data\nsources and expert knowledge, exploring the intricate\nrelationships between health grades and indices, and\ncomprehensively assessing the health state of transformers to\nobtain more accurate decision-making concerning operation and\nmaintenance.\n5.3 Big Data Analysis\nSince big data has been involved in power transformer data,\nconventional data processing and analysis can no longer meet the\nanalysis of the health and operating condition. As depicted in\nFigure 4 , big data in transformer condition assessment is\ncharacterized by various sources (e.g., PMS, EMS, and GIS),\nhigh volume (several TBs), wide variety (e.g., DGA data,\ntextual defect records, infrared images, videos, and partial\ndischarge patterns), varying velocity (e.g., online monitoring,\ndaily inspections, and quarterly/yearly maintenance), veracity\n(e.g., missing data, redundancies, and malicious information),\nand values (e.g., operational, technical, and economic) (Dijcks,\n2012; Zinaman et al., 2015). In such cases, it is indispensable for\npower utilities to extract valuable information from large volumes\nand varieties of both real-time and historical data to make data-\ndriven decisions. In particular, big data analysis contributes to\nbetter monitoring, operation, and maintenance of power\ntransformers (Bhattarai et al., 2019).\nAt present, big data analysis technology has been preliminarily\napplied to the condition assessment of power transmission and\ntransformation equipment, and certain research results have been\nobtained, mainly including abnormal state identi ﬁcation\n(Catterson et al., 2010 ; Liang et al., 2018 ; Lin et al., 2018 ;\nZhang et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2020), association rule mining\n(Sheng et al., 2018), differentiated warning value calculation (Qi\net al., 2020), transformer condition assessment (Yan et al., 2018),\nand fault diagnosis and prediction (Sheng et al., 2018; Zhou et al.,\n2019). Given that data loss and abnormalities result from\nenvironmental interference, internal fault, and sensors’failures\n(Catterson et al., 2010), Lin et al. used association rules and\nwavelet neural networks to identify the abnormal sensor data and\nthe abnormal state of the transformers (Lin et al., 2018). Several\nanomalous state detection methods were also applied to\ndistinguish the normal and abnormal behavior, including\nauxiliary feature vector and density-based spatial clustering of\napplications with noise (Liu et al., 2020), improved K-means\nclustering (Liang et al., 2018), improved Canopy model (Zhang\net al., 2018 ). Research by ( Sheng et al., 2018 ) utilized the\nprobabilistic graphic model to re ﬂect the association rules\namong various state parameters of the transformer. The mined\nassociation rules contributed to improve the prediction accuracy.\nQi et al. (2020 ) used fuzzy c-means (FCM) and Euclidean\ndistance to identify the optimal transformer properties. In\nthese studies, they identiﬁed operation age, voltage grade, and\noil type to better characterize the differences between\ntransformers based on dissolved gas data analysis. A\ndifferentiated warning rule could be obtained by the\ncalculation of three selected optimal classi ﬁcation properties\nthrough the association analysis between distribution\ncharacteristics and defect/fault rate, which effectively reduced\nthe rate of false positives and false negatives.Zhou et al. (2019)\ntransferred the waveform processing to the distribution\ncharacteristic analysis of partial discharge signals via\nFrontiers in Energy Research | www.frontiersin.org May 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 9041099\nWang et al. Review on Transformer Condition Assessment\nmaximum likelihood estimation, which improved the accuracy of\npartial discharge estimation, particularly in low signal noise ratio\nconditions. Dai et al. (2017) adopted multi-layer and multi-\ndimension mapping to extract more detailed differences\nbetween fault types based on DBN, exploring different training\ndatasets, different characterization parameters, and sample\ndatasets. Moreover, the effect of discharge and overheating\nmultiple faults on the diagnosis model was studied.\n6 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE TRENDS\nCBM is to obtain the transformer maintenance decisions\naccording to its conditions, and transformer condition\nassessment is a prerequisite and basic work for CBM in\ntransformer asset management. In other words, transformer\ncondition assessment can provide powerful economic and\ntechnical support and decision-making strategies for\ntransformer CBM and asset management. Therefore, we\nsummarized the statistical analysis for components and types\nof transformer failures that are prone to occur and found that on-\nload tap-changer, winding, bushing, tank, and core are more\nlikely to fail, and electrical factors, lightning, and insulation are\nthe most important causes of transformer failures. To cope with\nvarious patterns of transformer failures and comprehensively\ninvestigate large amount of transformer stat data, this article\nprovides a uniformed framework for transformer condition\nassessment, from data acquisition, data processing, and data\nanalysis, to visual application. With regard to data acquisition,\nthe data required for transformer operating condition comes\nfrom different subsystems with different condition monitoring\ntechniques (e.g., inspections, frequency response analysis, and\ninfrared thermography), which can be classiﬁed into internal data\n(e.g., transformer operating and maintenance records, DGA,\nfuran, and insulation resistance) and external data (e.g., load,\nsystem faults, economic factors, and power grid dispatching).\nFurthermore, aiming at data analysis for transformer condition\nassessment, a comprehensive overview of the traditional\ncondition assessment method is presented by surveying the\nprevious studies, including advantages and limitations. With\nthe advancement of smart grids, data acquisition, arti ﬁcial\nintelligence, and renewable energy technology, several state-of-\nthe-art research studies on transformer health state evaluation\nhave been conducted. The newﬁndings for intelligent algorisms\nare comprehensively surveyed from three new perspectives,\nincluding differentiated evaluation, uncertainty evaluation, and\nbig data analysis. Compared with traditional assessment methods,\nthe evolution of intelligent algorisms can quickly extract key state\nparameters, effectively mine the universality and individuality of\ntransformers, deeply excavate the association relations, and\nimplement data-driven evaluation.\nTransformer condition assessment is an indispensable tool for\nthe safe and reliable transmission of electricity energy, which\ndeserves and needs constant attention. With the development of\ngreen and clean power, there has emerged an inexorable trend\nthat energy consumption relies more on green and clean\nelectricity. Ultrahigh high-voltage (UHV) technology of long-\ndistance power transmission provides an excellent chance for\nconcentrated development of green energy. At the same time,\npower equipment faces new requirements. Power transformers\ntend to be larger and more complicated. Large-size transformers\npossess CPS characteristics and their components are close\ncoupled, which pose great challenges to condition assessment\nand fault diagnosis (Li et al., 2016a). Owning to the increasing\nresearch interest in transformer condition assessment, the\nfollowing trends and tendencies for transformer condition\nassessment are recommended to be further investigated.\n6.1 Enhancing New Manufacturing\nTechnology\nNovel smart sensors have the potential to enhance the\nadvancement of power systems and power equipment. With\nthe advancement of Internet of Things and mobile Internet\ntechnologies, reliable and low-cost distributed intelligent\nsensor networks will be widely deployed in smart grids.\nMoreover, a large number of smart sensors with high\nprecision (Chatterjee et al., 2013), such as gas sensor arrays\n(Uddin et al., 2016; Jang et al., 2018), infrared spectroscopy\n(Zhao et al., 2014 ), photoacoustic spectroscopy ( Mao and\nWen, 2015), gas chromatograph techniques (Fan et al., 2017),\nsolid oxide fuel cell chromatographic detector (Fan et al., 2020)\nhave been studied, manufactured and applied, providing a more\ncomprehensive data basis for big data analysis. Another trend is\nthe novel smart transformer (Saha et al., 2015). The development\nof power transformers is following the direction of large capacity,\nhigh voltage, reliability, intelligence, energy ef ﬁciency, and\nenvironmental protection. Smart transformers with self-\ndiagnosis functions are an important issue in the current\ntransformer industry. Compared with existing transformers,\nsmart transformers are equipped with more electronic devices,\nsmart sensors and actuators, a good communication interface,\noperating information management, condition diagnosis and\nevaluation, operation data monitoring, and fault alarm\nfunction. In particular, smart transformers (hybrid\ntransformers) that can resist the large-scale penetration of\nintermittent new energy sources and applications (e.g.,\nphotovoltaic power generation, electric vehicles) should be\nfurther implemented and investigated (Hunziker et al., 2020).\n6.2 Improving Data Quality\nAt present, research institutions, power utilities, and\nmanufacturers have collected a large amount of power\ntransformer data, including operating conditions, oil tests, live-\nline detection, online monitoring, maintenance records, and fault\ndefects. However, the transformer state data is characterized by\nheterogeneity, uneven data quality, and asynchrony, which is\nstored in different formats in scattered, disparate sub-systems.\nDue to error-prone measurements, data duplication, and data\nmissing, the accuracy of transformer condition assessment is\npoor. In the case of low data quality, the results of transformer\nfault diagnosis and predictive analysis will deviate from the actual\nresults (Li et al., 2016a). Therefore, it is extremely signiﬁcant to\nimprove the quality of transformer data. In the future, data\nFrontiers in Energy Research | www.frontiersin.org May 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 90410910\nWang et al. Review on Transformer Condition Assessment\nquality evaluation and data governance should be carried out\nfurther to ensure smooth research on the evaluation work from\nthe source.\n6.3 Making the Best of Unstructured Data\nA large amount of unstructured data (e.g., infrared thermal\nimages, videos, ultraviolet images, partial discharge pattern,\nfrequency response, and waveform curves) are collected by\nmanual inspection, online monitoring techniques and smart\nmeasurements, which can help effectively diagnose the\ntransformer defects and failures such as oil leakage, cooling\nsystem malfunction, winding distortion or displacement, and\npartial discharge, and provide an important decision-making\nfor transformer condition assessment and fault diagnosis. For\ninstance, enormous textual documents such as trouble and\ndefect records, operating tickets, and logs of operation and\nmaintenance are valuable for transformer condition\nassessment. Therefore, it is indispensable to carry out\nunstructured data mining, feature extraction and structural\nconversion of acoustic signal s, images and text related to\ntransformer state, improve the statistical analysis and\nknowledge mining of transformer data, and support multi-\ndimensional and comprehensive evaluation of transformer\noperating conditions via text mining technology, pattern\nrecognition technology, image processing technology,\nmachine learning and deep learning technology. In terms of\ntext mining,Xie et al. (2016) used hidden Markov model-based\ntext reprocessing to extract the key information from fault and\ndefect elimination record texts to assess the operating condition\nof distribution transformers and combined them with typical\npower-off tests and live line detecting results. To identify the\ncauses of transformer failures, Ravi et al. (2019)s t u d i e d3 9 3\nterms and 103 documents and found that“lightning,”“ leak,”\n“cable,”“ animal,” and “temperature” were the major causes.\nWangfang and Liuquan (2019 ) utilized knowledge graph\ntechnology to construct an error recognition model of power\nequipment defect records.\n6.4 Conducting Small Sample Data Learning\nA typical characteristic of transformer state parameters is that\nthere is massive normal operating data and small sample fault\ndata. In essence, state data concerning the health and operating\ncondition of power transformers have increased dramatically,\nand big data technology has already become a powerful data-\ndriven tool in equipment condition assessment. It should be\nnoted that there are still several limitations: 1) due to some\nfactors (e.g., transformer sensor types, operation and\nmaintenance mode, state information acquisition), state\nparameters of the transformer exhibit “pseudo big data” and\nonly several types of state parameters are obtained; 2) public\ntransformer data are not available because of national security,\nenterprise privacy, and trade secrets; and 3) most power\ntransformers are under good operation and maintenance\nmanagement, which makes train/test data for intelligent\nalgorisms insufﬁcient.\nIn addition, power transformer faults are small-probability\nevents and the fault case records are not comprehensive, which\nleads to the lack of abnormal transformer samples. As a result,\nunbalanced transformer datasets cause great difﬁculty in the\napplications of machine learning and big data methods and\npoor results in transformer condition assessment (Cheng et al.,\n2019). Machine learning generally has quantitative requirements\nfor training samples. However, transformer anomalies and fault\nsamples are relatively small, which limits the effectiveness of\nmachine learning. Hence, it is essential to construct a uniﬁed fault\nsample information management system in which fault records\nare collected and supplemented. On the other hand, it is critical to\nfurther study the machine learning method that can be applied to\nsmall sample datasets.\n6.5 Applying Expert Knowledge to Data\nMining\nFrom the cybernetic point of view, transformers are typically\ncomplex “grey box”systems. It is necessary to focus on a scientiﬁc\nresearch paradigm that combines mechanism analysis and data-\ndriven methods for transformer condition assessment. On the\none hand, knowledge and experience related to the transformer\nstate are accumulated in the long-term electricity production,\nwhich are valuable for actual guidance. On the other hand,\nmachine learning technology demonstrates its great advantages\nin intelligently analyzing the data, discovering potential\nproblems, and excavating hidden laws. Therefore, how to\nintegrate the expert experience of equipment state assessment\ninto machine learning, combine knowledge analysis with data\nmining, and establish a mechanized expression model of expert\nexperience and a knowledge-driven learning model are important\nchallenges that need to be overcome for expert knowledge sharing\nand inheritance (Liu et al., 2019; Kou et al., 2020). Knowledge\ngraph technology is becoming a key enabler for large-scale\nprocessing of massive collections of semantic knowledge from\nstructured web data, text, and images (Fensel, 2019), which has\nbeen widely applied in various modern domains (Wang et al.,\n2021; Wang et al., 2022). It is believed that knowledge graphs offer\nan effective solution that merges large-scale data processing and\nexpert knowledge with robust semantic technologies ( Galkin\net al., 2017).\n6.6 Analyzing Failure Mechanism\nThe failure mechanism refers to the correlation rules between\nfault features and transformer state parameters through\ntheoretical or experimental analysis. How to combine\nmachine learning with the existing under-fault mechanism to\nperceive the “correlation” of complex transformer faults and\neffectively extract key features of transformer operating\ncondition are challenging issues for transformer condition\nassessment. Moreover, the transformers display the\ncharacteristics of CPS, with the information network and\nphysical world being closely coupled. The power system CPS\ntheory may be used to study the strong coupled relationships\nbetween the transformer and different states of information,\nwhich helps establish an effective and accurate mapping\nbetween the data space and the physical entity and supports\noperating condition assessment and CBM.\nFrontiers in Energy Research | www.frontiersin.org May 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 90410911\nWang et al. Review on Transformer Condition Assessment\n6.7 Integrating Multiple Methods\nExisting condition assessment models are still far from“compatibility”.\nDue to the fact that various methods have their own superiorities, it is\ndifﬁcult to generalize them. Therefore, it is urgently critical to integrate\nmultiple methods for transformer condition assessment to\ncomplement each other and obtain the mutual coordination of\ndifferent models. However, employing hybrid models on small\ntraining sets may increase the risk of overﬁtting the training data,\nthereby resulting in worse“generalization”performance on the out-of-\nsample test set (Mirowski and LeCun, 2012).\n6.8 Incorporating External Factors\nThe external factors of the transformer mainly include\nenvironmental meteorology data, grid operation data, and\nmalicious data attacks. In recent years, the worldwide harsh\nand extreme weather has frequently occurred, contributing to\nan increase in domestic and international power grid accidents.\nExternal extreme environmental factors (e.g., lightning, heavy\nrain, strong winds, dense fog, high temperatures, low\ntemperatures, freezing rain) may cause catastrophic damage\nto t power transformers and other electrical equipment (Chen\net al., 2009; Schexnayder, 2009; Chen et al., 2021b). Meanwhile,\nloads and harmonics of the power grids also present several\nchallenges to the transformer, and false data injection attacks\n(Wang et al., 2018 ) and other transformer-substation\ncommunication network attacks threaten the safety and\nr e l i a b i l i t yo fp o w e rs u b s t a t i o n sa n dp o w e rn e t w o r k s(Kerr\net al., 2010).\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nJIW: designed and wrote this manuscript.
