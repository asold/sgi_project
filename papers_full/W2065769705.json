Ladle\nReceived: 1 July 2014 / Accepted: 21 September 2014 / Published online: 14 October 2014\n/C211Japan Ethological Society and Springer Japan 2014\nAbstract There are few examples of facultative tool use\nin animals under natural conditions. We provide the ﬁrst\ndescription of tool use in great antshrikes ( Taraba major),\nwhich were observed using stone anvils to break the shells\nof the land snail ( Achatina fulica). This behavior is almost\ncertainly of extremely recent origin given the lack of pre-\nvious reports of tool use in T. major and the very recent\n(1980s) introduction of A. fulica into Brazil. Tool use in\nthis particular population is probably a ﬂexible behavioral\ntrait that arose in response to the high density of exotic\nsnails in this locality.\nKeywords Taraba major /C1Achatina fulica /C1Exotic\nspecies /C1Facultative behavior /C1Anvils\nIntroduction\nTool use is infrequent but taxonomically widespread\namong vertebrates (Bentley-Condit and Smith 2010; Seed\nand Byrne 2010; Shumaker et al. 2011), being found in\nthree phyla and seven classes of animals (Bentley-Condit\nand Smith 2010). Among the taxa that most frequently use\ntools are birds, certain species of which have been observed\nto use tools for diverse activities such as food capture, food\nextraction, and agonism. Indeed, one of the ﬁrst examples\nof tool use in animals was observed in thrushes (genus\nTurdus), who beat snails against stones (‘‘anvils’’) to\nextract them from their shells (Morris 1954; Goodhart\n1958; Henty 1986). The use of anvils has subsequently\nbeen observed in many taxa, including a ﬁsh (Jones et al.\n2011), and it has been intensively studied in species such as\nchimpanzees (Inoue-Nakamura and Matsuzawa 1997) and\nNew Caledonian crows (Kenward et al. 2006).\nStereotyped tool use can evolve from pre-existing behav-\niors or, in cognitively advanced taxa such as birds and\nmammals, tool use can develop as a ﬂexible behavior that\nincorporates a signiﬁcant learning component (Hunt et al.\n2014). Distinguishing these two origins in nature is often\ndifﬁcult, since speciﬁc tool-use behaviors may be ancient in\norigin. Here we report a new example of tool use that is very\nlikely of a very recent origin: the use of stone anvils by great\nantshrikes (Taraba major) to break the shells of an introduced\nland snail (Achatina fulica). Our postulation of recent origin is\nbased on: (1) the lack of previous reports of tool use in T.\nmajor (this species does not appear on the comprehensive list\nof tool-using species provided by Bentley-Condit and Smith\n2010, nor in later publications),despite being an abundant and\nwidespread species in South America, and (2) the recent\n(1980s) introduction of A. fulica in Brazil (Thiengo et al.\n2007).\nElectronic supplementary material The online version of this\narticle (doi:10.1007/s10164-014-0412-6) contains supplementary\nmaterial, which is available to authorized users.\nM.

This par-\nticular site (a small farm) is infested with A. fulica, which\ncan be easily located in open areas and in the understory of\nthe forest.\nResults and discussion\nA male of T. major was observed to catch juvenile snails,\nbring them repeatedly to the same stone (roughly oval\nshape, &20 9 10 cm), and break the shell by repeatedly\nstriking against the ‘‘anvil.’’ This same individual was\nobserved engaging in this activity four times over several\ndays. Two other large piles of broken shells (estimated\nfragments from [10 individual snails) were also observed:\none next to a stone and the other next to the iron base of a\nbroken plant pot in an open area between the farm resi-\ndence and the forest. The breaking of the shell in these two\nanvils was heard simultaneously, indicating that this\nbehavior was not restricted to a single individual. There\nwas no evidence of shell-breaking behavior in adjacent\nforest sites, possibly due to the lower density of A. fulica.\nGreat antshrikes are strongly omnivorous, feeding on a\nwide range of taxa that include seeds, crustaceans, insects,\narachnids, mollusks, and small mammals (Beltzer 1987).\nHowever, these observations are the ﬁrst documented\naccount of tool use in this species. Given the ecological\ncontext, it is highly likely that this behavior is an example\nof ﬂexible tool use, which developed in the absence of\nthree key barriers (as deﬁned by Hunt et al. 2014). First,\nthere was a need to learn that an object can be used to\nfacilitate solving a problem (extracting large snails from\ntheir shells) that would be difﬁcult to solve without the\ntool. The smaller sizes of the majority of Brazilian snail\nspecies and their lower relative abundances may have\nreduced the selective beneﬁts of this behavioral innovation\nin other sites. Second, there was an adequate working\nmemory for adopting tool use. As an omnivore, T. major\nalready had a broad repertoire of prey-capture behaviors\nand was thus a good candidate for tool-using behavior.\nThird, the practical difﬁculty of manipulating the object in\na controlled way was low. As seen in other anvil-using\nbirds, the physical act of breaking shells on rocks is rela-\ntively straightforward in terms of physical manipulation.\nGiant African land snails were accidentally introduced\ninto Brazil in the 1980s (Thiengo et al. 2007), and the snail-\ncapture behavior documented here is likely to have\ndeveloped at some time after this point. There is a small\npossibility that this behavior was already widespread in this\nspecies as a means to extract native mollusks. However,\nthis is unlikely since mollusks typically make up a small\nfraction of the diet of T. major , with most populations\nspecializing on arthropod prey (Beltzer 1987; Ridgely and\nTudor 1994). Thus, the most parsimonious explanation is\nFig. 1a–d Predation of\nAchatina fulica by Taraba\nmajor: a male T. major holds\nbroken shell of A. fulica over\nanvil; b male T. major in the act\nof striking shell against the\nanvil; c, d examples of broken\nshells of A. fulica\n56 J Ethol (2015) 33:55–57\n123\nthat tool use in this particular population is a ﬂexible\nbehavioral trait that arose due to the high density of exotic\nsnails in this locality. Such a rapid development of tool use\nas a strategy to optimally exploit this abundant food source\nprovides a potentially interesting case study of the origins\nof tool use. Given the huge damage being caused by A.\nfulica in South America, predation at high levels by an\nabundant native species may also have practical implica-\ntions in relation to controlling this highly problematic\nmollusk (Carlsson et al. 2009).\nAcknowledgments RJL is funded by CNPQ, grant number\n311412/2011-4.\nReferences\nBeltzer AH (1987) Ecologı ´a alimentaria de batara ´ grande Taraba\nmajor (aves: Formicariidae) en el valle aluvial del rı ´o parana´\nmedio, Argentina.
