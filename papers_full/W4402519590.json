    "abstract": "Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into e-government applications has the potential to improve public service delivery through advanced data processing and automation. This paper explores critical aspects of a modular and reproducible architecture based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for deploying LLM-based assistants within e-government systems. By examining current practices and challenges, we propose a framework ensuring that Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are modular and reproducible, essential for maintaining scalability, transparency, and ethical standards. Our approach utilizing Haystack demonstrates a complete multi-agent Generative AI (GAI) virtual assistant that facilitates scalability and reproducibility by allowing individual components to be independently scaled. This research focuses on a comprehensive review of the existing literature and presents case study examples to demonstrate how such an architecture can enhance public service operations. This framework provides a valuable case study for researchers, policymakers, and practitioners interested in exploring the integration of advanced computational linguistics and LLMs into e-government services, although it could benefit from further empirical validation.",
