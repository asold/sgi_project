    "abstract": "Geolocating network devices is essential for various research areas. Yet, despite notable advancements, it continues to be one of the most challenging issues for experimentalists. An approach for geolocating that has proved effective is leveraging geolocating hints in PTR records associated with network devices. Extracting and interpreting geo-hints from PTR records is challenging because the labels are primarily intended for human interpretation rather than computational processing. Additionally, a lack of standardization across operators -- and even within a single operator, due to factors like rebranding, mergers, and acquisitions -- complicates the process. We argue that Large Language Models (LLMs), rather than humans, are better equipped to identify patterns in DNS PTR records, and significantly scale the coverage of tools like Hoiho. We introduce The Aleph, an approach and system for network device geolocation that utilizes information embedded in PTR records. The Aleph leverages LLMs to classify PTR records, generate regular expressions for these classes, and establish hint-to-location mapping per operator. We present results showing the applicability of using LLMs as a scalable approach to leverage PTR records for infrastructure geolocation.",
