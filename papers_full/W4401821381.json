    "abstract": "Modern generative artificial intelligence techniques like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) may be applied in support of precision oncology treatment discussions. Experts routinely review published literature for evidence and recommendations of treatments in a labor-intensive process. A RAG pipeline may help reduce this effort by providing chunks of text from these publications to an off-the-shelf large language model (LLM), allowing it to answer related questions without any fine-tuning. This potential application is demonstrated by retrieving treatment relationships from a trusted data source (OncoKB) and reproducing over 80% of them by asking simple questions to an untrained Llama 2 model with access to relevant abstracts.",
