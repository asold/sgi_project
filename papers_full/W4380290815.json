Agency emerged \nindependent of BS plasticity. Here we aimed to replicate these findings in older adults (OA). Although they are still able to \nlearn new motor tasks, brain plasticity and learning capacity are reduced in OA. We predicted that OA would be able to gain \ncontrol over the virtual tool indicated by the emergence of agency but would show less BS plasticity as compared to YA. \nStill, an association between BS plasticity and body ownership was expected. OA were trained in AR to control a virtual \ngripper to enclose and touch a virtual object. In the visuo-tactile (VT) but not the vision-only (V) condition, vibro-tactile \nfeedback was applied through a CyberTouch II glove when the tool touched the object. BS plasticity was assessed with a \ntactile distance judgement task where participants judged distances between two tactile stimuli applied to their right forearm. \nParticipants further rated their perceived ownership and agency after training. As expected, agency emerged during the use \nof the tool. However, results did not indicate any changes in the BS of the forearm after virtual tool-use training. Also, an \nassociation between BS plasticity and the emergence of body ownership could not be confirmed for OA. Similar to YA, the \npractice effect was stronger in the visuo-tactile feedback condition compared with the vision-only condition. We conclude \nthat a sense of agency may strongly relate to improvement in tool-use in OA independent of alterations in the BS, while \nownership did not emerge due to a lack of BS plasticity.\nKeywords Virtual tool-use · Forearm body schema · Sense of ownership and agency · Somatosensory representation · \nOlder adults\nIntroduction\nOne of the hallmark skills of humans is the ability to han-\ndle an object (the “tool”) to reach, manipulate or grasp \nwhile interacting with objects in the environment (Miller \net al. 2017; Cardinali et al. 2012). According to Nabeshima \net al. (2006), tool-use allows us to overcome the limitations \nof the bodies in our daily life, moving beyond the limits \nimposed by the lengths of one’s limbs or the type of one’s \nend-effector. Herewith, tool-use is particularly important for \nolder adults (OA) who suffer from various sensorimotor and \nperceptual decline but are dependent on using tools in their \ndaily life to maintain their independent living.\nAccording to the dyadic model (for review: Cardinali \net al. 2011; Head and Holmes 1911), the following two \ndistinct subcomponents constitute the body representa-\ntion: body image (BI) and body schema (BS; de Vignemont \n2010; Dijkerman and de Haan 2007). The BI is a perceptual \nconscious representation of the body (Cardinali et al. 2012) \nand is involved in body perception, body affect (Cardinali \net al. 2012; de Vignemont 2010; Gallagher 2005), and body \nconcept (Segura-Valverde et al. 2017). The BS is seen as an \nunconscious sensorimotor representation of the body that is \nused for action planning and execution of movements (Mar-\ntel et al. 2016; d’ Angelo et al. 2018). In contrast to the BI \nCommunicated by Melvyn A. Goodale.\n * Amir Jahanian Najafabadi \n amir.jahanian@uni-bielefeld.de\n1 Department of Cognitive Neuroscience, Bielefeld University, \n33501 Bielefeld, Germany\n2 School of Business, Social and Decision Sciences, \nConstructor University Bremen, 28759 Bremen, Germany\n3 Department of Computer Science, University of Bremen, \n28359 Bremen, Germany\n1740 Experimental Brain Research (2023) 241:1739–1756\n1 3\nwhich is seen as a stable representation of body shape and \nsize (Cardinali et al. 2009), the BS has been defined as a \nmore short-term representation (Cardinali et al. 2012). It \nflexibly updates with every change in the state of the body, \ne.g., due to growth and body lengthening accompanying \nmaturation—or as an effect of tool-use (Cardinali et al. 2012, \n2009). In this line, extensive experimental efforts in healthy \nyoung adults (YA) during the past two decades contributed \nto an understanding of how short- and long-term tool-use \nexperience modifies the body image (BI) and body schema \n(BS) (Martel et al. 2019; Day et al. 2017; McCormack et al. \n2011; Miller et al. 2014) and how a sense of body ownership \nand a sense of agency, and thus feelings of control over the \ntool and its movements emerge (Nava et al. 2018; Jung and \nHughes 2016). However, less is known about effects of tool-\nuse training on ownership and agency in OA.\nWhile ownership over a tool refers to tools being per -\nceived as belonging to one’s own body and the sense that \n“I am the one that is going to experience, e.g., when one’s \nbody is moving regardless of whether voluntarily or invol-\nuntarily” (Gallagher 2000, p15), agency is the feeling that \nactions or events of a tool are produced by one’s own body, \nand that the agent is the cause of the tool’s action (Gallagher \n2000, 2018).\nSynchronous multisensory inputs from different modali-\nties play a fundamental role in producing body ownership \n(Maravita et al. 2003). As described by Sposito et al. (2012), \nownership, i.e., tools being perceived as belonging to one’s \nown body, is highly plastic, and involves multiple body rep-\nresentations in the human brain. Cardinali et al (2012) and de \nVignemont (2007) proposed that the BS becomes a source \nof ownership because it constitutes the spatial content of the \nbodily sensations that localise bodily properties within the \nBS. Empirical studies support the notion of tool use-induced \nrepresentational plasticity whereby the tool is integrated \ninto the existent BS in the somatosensory cortex, resulting \nin a changed BI (Ma and Hommel 2015; Miller et al. 2014). \nOur own recent results suggest that the emergence of owner-\nship may strongly relate to changes in the sensorimotor BS \nwhich then are likely to be reflected in an altered BI (Jahanian \nNajafabadi et al. 2022). Therefore, mostly bottom-up afferent \ninformation received from multisensory modalities contrib-\nutes to the emergence of ownership (Ma and Hommel 2015; \nTsakiris and Haggard 2005).\nAgency is strongly dependent on efferent components, \nas actions are centrally generated. Further, a recent study \nfound that agency plays a crucial role in mediating e.g., the \neffect of synchronous training and the possibility to sense the \ncontrol over an external object, here a virtual hand, without \nperceiving it as part of the body (D’ Angelo et al. 2018). \nThese authors further suggested that a sense of agency plays \na major role in the construction of the BS and peripersonal \nspace (PPS) representations.\nStudies on tool-use training in OA with reduced BS \nplasticity could contribute to a better understanding of the \ndependencies of ownership and agency on BS plasticity. The \nprogressive decline of cognitive and sensorimotor abilities \nwith ageing could potentially affect malleability of body \nrepresentation (BR) and particularly BS in OA (Sorrentino \net al. 2021; Raimo et al. 2019). In this line, an earlier study \nargued that impaired tool-use in OA is caused not only by \nage-related decline in motor function but also cognitive, \nparticularly semantic dysfunction (Lesourd et al. 2016). \nHowever, the mechanism of how age-related sensorimo-\ntor alterations contribute to long-term changes in the BS \nrequires more evidence, particularly for implicit plasticity \nof BS and BI, ownership, and agency (Raimo et al. 2019).\nWith respect to tool-use learning and representational \nplasticity in OA, a few studies have been conducted. Some of \nstudies focused on attentional and perceptual components in \ntool-use performance. For example, a study by Bloesch et al. \n(2013) confirmed a lack of spatial compression (the tool-use \neffect on distance estimation) in OA and implied a failure \nof the visuomotor system in transforming PPS to extra per -\nsonal spatial representations during tool-use (Costello et al. \n2015). In the same vein, a recent study reported that tool-use \naction is affected by spatial and other aspects of perception \nand indirectly influenced by attention (Witt 2021). It was \nconcluded that the effect of tool-use on spatial perception \nconfirms that tools are incorporated into the existing BS and \nembodied without specified age-related components. These \nfindings are particularly interesting, especially given that \nage differences indicated by these studies may significantly \naffect how OA plan and guide actions in their PPS compared \nwith YA (Bloesch et al. 2013).\nFurher research focused on the visual, motor and tactile \naspects of sensorimotor learning in OA compared with YA. \nGhafouri and Lestienne (2000) suggested that OA have diffi-\nculty integrating information from different sensory modali-\nties that are required to form a stable spatial representation \nof their own body. In this line, a study by Teixeira and Lima \n(2009) found that in OA sensorimotor learning is more \ndependent on visual signals compared to visuomotor sig -\nnals. A further study by Devlin and Wilson (2010) reported \na decline in visuo-spatial processing and the integrity of \nBS-related information with age that is required to update \nthe location of the whole body through the mental trans-\nformation process (Devlin and Wilson 2010). Costello and \ncolleagues (2015, 2017) additionally reported that for OA \nthe integration of visual-tactile modalities during tool-use is \nparticularly important since it is one of the major challenges \nin older age.\nMarotta et al. ( 2018) examined age effects on owner -\nship induced by the rubber hand illusion (RHI) paradigm \n(Botvinick and Cohen 1998). They revealed that both YA \nand OA experienced feelings of ownership and localization \n1741Experimental Brain Research (2023) 241:1739–1756 \n1 3\nof touch over the rubber hand after synchronous stroking, \nfollowed by a full incorporation of the rubber hand into \nthe BS. They emphasised a flexible representation of the \nbody, together with multisensory integration of conflicting \nvisual, tactile, and proprioceptive information, leading to a \nfull incorporation of the rubber hand into the internal body \nmodel (Marotta et al. 2018).\nGraham et al. (2014) used a modified version of the RHI \nto study mechanisms of self-perception. In paradigm, par -\nticipants receive a live image of their hand from a monitor \nin front of them which is called projected RH and creates \nthe illusory sensation of their hand with a precise timing of \nsynchronous or asynchronous stroking. The authors found \na decreased subjective feeling of ownership with increas-\ning age and a greater proprioceptive drift as a change in \nthe location of participants’ finger relative to the location \nthey felt the finger (Graham et al. 2014). Another RHI study \nalso found a decreased subjective feeling of ownership and \nagency with increasing age but no changes in propriocep-\ntive drift (Kállai et al. 2017). These authors reported a \ndecreased integration of visuo-tactile stimuli in OA during \nsynchronous stimulation and less induced illusion in the \nvisuo-tactile condition compared to YA. No age effects on \nmultisensory integration were observed when visuo-propri-\noceptive feedback was synchronously presented during the \ntask (Kállai et al. 2017).\nMost prior approaches lacked effective means to separate \nthe tactile and visual modalities such that tactile feedback \ncan be systematically manipulated on top of the visual chan-\nnel. Various studies supported the positive impact of virtual \nand augmented reality (VR/AR) as a tool to manipulate and \nintegrate visual and sensorimotor haptic feedback on task \nperformance in a controlled manner (for review; Braun et al. \n2018; Kong et al. 2017; Prewett et al. 2012; Kappers 2011). \nProviding vibro-tactile stimulation in AR also allows more \ndirect comparisons with conditions involving real physi-\ncal tools than VR because the participant’s normal physi-\ncal environment remains fully visible during the training. \nTherefore, the use of haptic feedback in AR might improve \nperformance by making our experience of interacting with \nobjects more realistic. In our own previous study (Jahanian \nNajafabadi et al. 2022), we showed that immersive VR and \nAR can provide rich multisensory experiences, especially \nin combination with vibro-tactile feedback by so-called \n‘cybergloves’. We found that the emergence of ownership \ndepended on BS plasticity but not the type of feedback. \nEmergence of agency was independent of feedback type and \nBS plasticity (Jahanian Najafabadi et al. 2022).\nWith this study, we aimed to replicate our previous \nresearch on YA with a sample of OA to study the asso-\nciation between the emergence of ownership, agency and \nplasticity of the BS in tool-use training. We used the same \nvirtual tool-use paradigm as in Jahanian Najafabadi et al. \n(2022 ) where participants had to grasp a virtual object \nwith a virtual gripper.\nLongo et al. (2010) found that the ability to perceive the \nsize of objects touching the skin is linked to an underlying \nimplicit representation of the body’s shape. Further studies \nsuggested, for several body parts, that the perception of \ntactile distance between two points on the skin is strongly \nlinked with the BS plasticity (Longo 2020; de Vignemont \net al. 2005). Previous studies then employed the tactile \ndistance judgement (TDJ) task as a standard paradigm to \nassess the plasticity of body representation and relies on \nthe ability of the brain to construct a mental map of the \nbody and its parts (Canzoneri et al. 2013; Miller et al. \n2014; Taylor-Clarke et al. 2004). In the current study, \nto test whether the training with the virtual tool led to a \nchange in the arm representation in the BS, we also used \na TDJ task which required participants to estimate the dis-\ntance between two tactile stimuli on the forearm oriented \neither along the arm axis in proximodistal orientation \nor orthogonal to it in mediolateral orientation (Jahanian \nNajafabadi et al. 2022; Miller et al. 2014, 2017).\nAfter each training condition, the participants answered \nquestionnaires about their subjective feeling of ownership \nand agency over the virtual tool. To further elucidate the \nrole of visual and tactile feedback in OA, participants were \ntrained in two different conditions. In one condition, par -\nticipants received only visual feedback where they saw \nthe virtual object and virtual gripper in AR, as well as \ntheir real hand and the table. In the other condition, when \nincorrectly touching the object at either side, vibro-tactile \nfeedback was applied on correctly or incorrectly touching \nthe object through a CyberTouch II glove.\nEmpirical evidence revealed that the BS is likely to \nremain plastic in the ageing human brain subject to daily \nsensorimotor experiences by learning, training or experi-\nences depending on occupation (Reuter et al. 2014; Dinse \n2006; Dinse et al. 1997; Kuehn et al. 2018). However, \nthe amount of BS plasticity seems to be reduced as is the \ncapacity for motor learning (Vieluf et al. 2015). We, there-\nfore, expected to replicate our previous findings from YA \nthat training with the virtual tool would likewise lead to a \nchange in the arm representation in OA, but that BS plas-\nticity would be reduced. Moreover, we hypothesized that \neven OA would be able to gain control over the virtual tool \nas indicated by the emergence of agency, but that due to \nimpaired motor learning and less BS plasticity, incorpora-\ntion of tools becomes more challenging for OA compared \nwith YA. Experiences of ownership and agency might \nbe comparatively salient in AR, due to their novelty in \ncomparison with more familiar physical tools but might \ndepend on the type of feedback. We therefore predicted \nthat despite age-related sensory decline, combined visual \n1742 Experimental Brain Research (2023) 241:1739–1756\n1 3\nand tactile feedback, as in real-world settings, would be \nmore effective than visual feedback alone.\nMethod\nParticipants\nFor this study, 41 healthy right-handed OA (22 males, 19 \nfemales, Mage: 68.92, SD: 4.49) were recruited from a cohort \nof families living in Bremen-Nord, Germany. Each partici-\npant was compensated with 10 Euros per hour. Participants \nhad normal-to-corrected vision with no known history of \nneurological abnormality or disease, provided informed con-\nsent (participation and publication), and were naïve to the \nexperimental hypothesis, acuity and errors. Data of two OA \nParticipants had to be discarded due to sickness during the \nexperiment, and the final analyses utilised data from a total \nof 39 OA participants. All subsequent analyses’ procedures \nwere approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of \nBremen and were in accordance with the principles of the \nDeclaration of Helsinki.\nStudy design\nParticipants underwent a virtual tool-use training in AR in \ntraining blocks with and without vibro-tactile feedback as \ndescribed in the training section below. The Purdue Peg-\nboard test was used at pre-test to measure unimanual and \nbimanual finger and hand dexterity of participants. BS \nwas assessed by the TDJ (cf., Jahanian Najafabadi et al. \n2022; Miller et al. 2014, 2017) and a tactile localization \ntask (TLT). TDJ and TLT were conducted before training \n(pre-test), after the training block with the first feedback con-\ndition (mid-test) and after the training block under the other \nfeedback condition (post-test). Both ownership and agency \nfor the virtual tool were assessed with questionnaires at mid-\ntest and post-test. Electroencephalography was obtained to \nrecord resting-state EEG patterns at all three time points and \ntask-related EEG during both training blocks (cf., Fig.  1) \nand somatosensory event-related potentials were obtained \nduring the TLT. As the focus of this paper is on changes of \nthe BS and the question of whether the predicted changes \nin the BS were correlated with the emergence of ownership \nand agency over the virtual tool, we will report only findings \nfrom the TDJ and the ownership and agency assessments. \nAdditionally, behavioural data as an indication of partici-\npant’ performance level during virtual tool-use training will \nbe used in our model.\nVirtual tool‑use training in AR\nParticipants sat in front of a white table, wearing a Meta2 \nAR headset (www. metav ision. com), which included ear -\nphones for receiving verbal instructions. A wireless HTC \nVive Tracker 2.0 model KLIM was attached to the back of \ntheir right hand. Next, participants donned a special glove \n(CyberTouch-II, CyberGlove System Inc., 2157 O'Toole \nAve, San Jose, USA; cf., Fig.  2) on their right hand. The \nCyberTouch-II provides fine-grained vibro-tactile feedback \non the inside of each finger and the palm. This glove fur -\nther records the finger movement. The vibrational frequency \ngenerated from the CyberTouch-II ranges from 0 to 125 Hz \nwith a total of 6 vibrotactile actuators: one on the inside of \neach finger, one on the palm. Vibrational amplitude is 1.2 N \npeak-to-peak at 125 Hz (max). Sensor resolution is 1 degree, \nsensor repeatability is 3 degrees, and sensor data rate is 90 \nrecords/sec.\nThe experimental AR tool-use training task was imple -\nmented in Unity (version 2018.3.8f1) and featured a virtual \ngripper tool consisting of two parallel legs connected to an \nelongated stick, and a blue cube as the target object that the \nparticipant had to enclose with the legs of the gripper tool \n(cf., Fig.  2). In addition to the AR environment generated \nin Unity, participants could see the real surface of the table \nand their hand. The end of the stick was virtually attached \nto the hand.\nThe virtual tool was modelled in Unity in a way that when \noverlaid with the physical table in physical space, its length \nequated to about 30 cm in the real reaching space of partici-\npants when placed at the starting position in front of the par-\nticipant. Given a forearm length of 25 cm (flat on the physi-\ncal table), all cubes in the virtual space could be reached. \nThis estimate is not perfectly precise because the apparent \nsize of the entire scene was influenced by the exact distance \nof the projection screen to the eyes of the participant, which \nPre-test Training Block 1 Mid-test Training Block 2 Post-test\nTDJ \n120 trials (visual or \nvisual-tactile      \nfeedback) \nTDJ,  \nOwnership & \nAgency \nQuestionnaires \n120 trials (visual or \nvisual-tactile \nfeedback)  \nTDJ,  \nOwnership & \nAgency \nQuestionnaires \nFig. 1  Experimental design\n1743Experimental Brain Research (2023) 241:1739–1756 \n1 3\nin turn could be modulated by the tightness of fit for the \ndevice. However, these differences were minimal. Further -\nmore, the relative proportions of the virtual scene (including \nthe tool, the plane and the objects therein) were fixed and \nthus equally affected by any such (small) variations.\nParticipants performed two blocks of training, one block \nwith visual and vibro-tactile feedback (VT condition) and \none block with only visual feedback (V condition). Each \nblock consisted of 120 trials in two half blocks and the order \nof blocks was randomised among participants.\nDuring training, to start a trial, participants first had to \nplace their hand at a central starting position before them, \nas indicated by a red square. Distance to the red square was \nkept constant. The blue target cube then appeared at different \nlocations in the plane in front of the participants. Partici-\npants had to move their hand, and thus, the virtual gripper, \ntowards the object to grasp it. The task was to enclose the \nvirtual object with the gripper without touching either side \nor moving the gripper into the object. In the condition with \ntactile feedback, touching the object resulted in vibratory \nfeedback to either the thumb (touched left), the index finger \n(touched right), or to the palm (touched at front). A trial \nended when the object was correctly enclosed by the gripper \nwithin 20 s and the participant moved the hand back to the \nstart position for the next trial. Participants were informed \nin advance that an error would occur if they touched (or \nmoved) inside the cube for more than 2 s or if they touched \nthe cube with the tool’s left or right sides for more than 2 s. \nThen the trial would fail and end.\nAfter 10 consecutive trials, there were 10 s of rest. After \neach half block of 60 trials, there was one minute of rest. \nAfter the first block (i.e., in the middle of the experiment), \napproximately 10 min rest were granted. Before each con-\ndition started and during the 1-min break after the first 60 \ntrials, participants were alerted about the type of feedback.\nBefore training, participants performed 20 practice trials \nto learn how to control the virtual tool by moving their right \nhand, forwards, backwards, left, or right.\nThe size of each side of the target cube was 40 × 40  mm2. \nEach training half block of 60 trials started with maximally \nFig. 2  Experimental setup for tool-use training.

This is to approach a stable 79.4% correct \nperformance level over the practice trials (Leek 2001). Grip-\nper size at this performance level thus is directly related to \nthe practice effect (PE) in respective half blocks. Minimum \ngripper size was 40.4 mm. Each participant performed the \nsame number of trials independently of correct or incorrect \ntrials. The total PE was calculated per block as the relative \ngripper size at the end of the block compared to the starting \ngripper size. PE was calculated by subtracting 48   mm3 as \nthe starting size from the average value of the last 5 trials \ndivided by 48   mm3 [(average value − 48)/48]. Therefore, \nnegative values indicate improved performance.\nMeasures of ownership and agency\nTo measure ownership and agency, we adopted the owner -\nship and agency questionnaire by Zhang and Hommel (2015) \n(cf. Table 1). Each statement was scored on a 7-point Lik -\nert scale (− 3 “strongly disagree” to +3 “strongly agree”). \nFour mean scores were calculated for statistical analysis by \naggregating three questions each: Q1–Q3 were about the \nexperience of perceiving the hand as one’s own hand, i.e., \nownership (this variable is abbreviated as BO) and Q7–Q9 \nwere directly associated with the experience of intentional \ncontrol, i.e., agency (BA). “BO-related” (Q4–Q6) and “BA-\nrelated” (Q10–Q12) concerned ownership and agency indi-\nrectly (Zhang and Hommel 2015). Scores from Q10–Q12 \nwere reverse-coded, as the corresponding questions are \nphrased in terms of a loss of control over the tool. Accord-\ning to Kalckert and Ehrsson (2012, 2014), an average score \nneeded to be higher than  +1 to indicate the emergence of \nownership and agency. Cronbach’s alpha for this study was \ncalculated for each of the four subscales, with all scales \ndemonstrating acceptable to excellent internal consistency \nin the first measurement (BO: α = 0.77, BO-related: α = 0.50, \nBA: α = 0.60, BA-related: α = 0.85, General scale: α = 0.65).\nTactile distance judgement (TDJ) task\nWe applied a TDJ task as pre-test, mid-test and post-test \n(adapted from Miller et al. 2014, 2017). Wooden blocks \nwere prepared with four sample pairs of screws, each with \ndifferent distances between them. The screws had round tips \nwith 9 mm diameter. For TDJ testing parallel to the arm \naxis (“proximodistal” alignment), 3 sample pairs with dis-\ntances of 57.62, 39.94, and 30.03 mm were prepared. For \nTDJ orthogonal to the arm axis (“mediolateral”), because of \nthe anisotropy of RFs, the sample with the largest distance \n(57.62 mm) was replaced by a sample with a smaller dis-\ntance of 22.00 mm. For each trial, one sample was applied \nin pseudorandomized order to the right forearm onto the \nmediolateral or proximodistal orientation (cf., Fig. 3). Each \ntrial lasted approximately 1 s. Each sample was presented 5 \ntimes, resulting in 30 trials in total (15 proximodistal and 15 \nmediolateral; 5 trials each per 3 distances per orientation).\nIn previous studies (Miller et al. 2014, 2017), partici-\npants were instructed to report verbally to the experimenter \nwhether they perceived the distance between the two stim-\nuli on the skin as shorter or longer than a reference in the \nforehead. In this study, we required participants to report \nabsolute estimates of the distances. This is in accordance \nwith other studies collecting absolute estimates such as ver-\nbal estimates (Longo and Golubova 2017; Fiori and Longo \n2018), adjustments of a visually perceived line (Tamè et al. \n2021), or kinaesthetic matching of the distance between two \nfingertips (Keizer et al. 2011; Knight et al. 2014).\nParticipants were instructed to indicate the perceived dis-\ntance between the centres of the screws using a digital calli-\nper (analogue scale). The calliper consisted of two steel legs \nfixed to a piece of wood attached to the table close to the \nTable 1  Statements used in \nthe ownership and agency \nquestionnaire (adapted from \nZhang and Hommel 2015)\nVariable Statement\nBO Q1: I felt as if the virtual tool was an extension of my own hand\nQ2: I felt as if the virtual tool was part of my body\nQ3: I felt as if the virtual tool was my hand\nBO-related Q4: It seems as if I had more than one right hand\nQ5: It felt as if my right hand no longer mattered, as if I only needed to sense the virtual tool\nQ6: I felt as if my real hand developed an enhanced sense of virtual touch\nBA Q7: I felt as if I could cause movements of the virtual tool\nQ8: I felt as if I could control movements of the virtual tool\nQ9: The virtual tool was obeying my will and I could make it move just like I wanted it to\nBA-related Q10: I felt as if the virtual tool was controlling my movements\nQ11: It seemed as if the virtual tool had a will of its own\nQ12: I felt as if the virtual tool was controlling me\n1745Experimental Brain Research (2023) 241:1739–1756 \n1 3\nparticipant’s left hand. The distance between the legs could be \neasily adjusted by the participant. Right after each TDJ stimu-\nlus, participants were asked to use their left hand to report \nthe perceived distance by adjusting the distance between the \ncalliper legs and the distance was noted by the experimenter \nbased on the mm scale displayed on the calliper monitor (see \nFig. 3). Importantly, participants were prevented from seeing \nthe stimuli presented to their forearm by putting an obstacle \nbetween their eyes and the right forearm throughout the TDJ \ntest. Therefore, they had no visual information about the real \ndistances, and whether the pairs of stimuli were administered \non proximodistal or mediolateral orientation.\nThe judgement error was used as an indicator of perceived \narm length and calculated as the difference between the \nreported distance and the actual distance that was presented \n(error = estimated distance–real distance). Positive values thus \nindicated an overestimation and negative values an underesti-\nmation of the distance. Estimation errors were averaged over \nthe five trials per condition (orientation and distance) and \ncalculated separately for pre-test, mid-test and post-test. A \ndecrease in the distance judgment would indicate that after \ntool-use training, the virtual tool was appended to the sen-\nsorimotor representation of the arm within the extent of the \nexisting BS, i.e., the somatotopic cortical representation. As \na consequence, the arm would become perceptually shorter, \nand different locations on the proximodistal orientation of the \nforearm would be perceived as closer together.\nData analysis and statistics\nThe dataset that was generated and analysed during the cur-\nrent study will be made available on publication in an Open \nScience Framework repository on OSF.io. Inferential sta-\ntistics were performed with R (R Core Team 2021) and the \nJamovi software environment version 2.2.5.6.2 (The Jamovi \nproject 2021). All relevant R packages (v4.1.1; RStudio \nv1.4.1717) and related references are listed in the supple-\nment. If not stated differently, p  < 0.05 were considered as \nsignificant, and p values  < 0.10 as marginally significant \nthroughout the report.\nResults\nBaseline asymmetry in TDJ error\nFirst, we examined baseline differences in Estimation Errors \nfor different Orientations and Distances.

The \nmodel's explanatory power is weak but marginally signifi -\ncant (R2 = 0.016, adj. R2 = 0.009, F(3464) = 2.55, p = 0.055; \ncf. Table 2). The model's intercept is at 1.24 (95% CI [− 0.5, \n2.99]) indicating neither under nor overestimation. Within \nthis model, the effect of Distance was significantly negative \n(t(464) = − 2.77, p = 0.006), indicating reduced Estimation \nErrors with increasing Distance. The effect of Orienta-\ntion (t (464) = 1.4, p = 0.163) and the interaction effect of \nOrientation and Distance were positive but not significant \n(t(464) = 1.02, p = 0.31).\nPractice effect and role of feedback type\nThe final performance level as approached by the stair -\ncase procedure during training Blocks was lower for the \nVT Feedback compared to the V Feedback condition (cf., \nFig. 5). This indicates that VT Feedback was more effec-\ntive. To quantify and statistically test the effect of Feedback \ncondition on PE, GLM analysis with PE as a dependent vari-\nable and Feedback type (V or VT) and Block number (first \nor second training block) as factors were conducted.\nResults revealed a significant effect of Feedback \n(F(1185) = 26.16, p < 0.001) and an interaction effect of \nBlock x Feedback on PE ( F(1185)  = 26.76, p < 0.001; \ncf., Table  3). Further, the model’s explanatory power \nis strong and significant (R 2 = 0.205, adj. R2 = − 0.193, \nF(3185) = 15.95, p < 0.001; cf., Table 3). The model’s inter-\ncept is at -0.355 (95% CI [− 0.38, − 0.33]) indicating a \nreduction in gripper size on average.\nA post hoc t-test revealed that PE was significantly \nstronger (more negative, indicating more reduction in grip-\nper size) for the VT than for the V Feedback condition \n(t(185) = − 5.11; p < 0.001, cf., Fig. 5). This difference was \nmainly driven by the difference between VT and V in the \nsecond practice Block (t(185) = − 4.56, p < 0.001).\nEffects of tool‑use training on TDJ error\nTo test our assumption that training would affect TDJ \nerror in the proximodistal Orientation, we followed a two-\nstep procedure. We first analysed the effects of Distance \nand baseline error on post-test error. The residuals of this \nTable 2  Effects of stimulus Orientation and Distance on estimation \nerrors in the TDJ\ndf = 464, Multiple R2 = 0.016, Adjusted R2 = 0.009, F(3464) = 2.55; \np = 0.055\nEstimate SE t p\n(Intercept) 1.245 0.89 1.40 0.163\nOrientation 2.66 1.78 1.49 0.136\nDistance − 0.22 0.079 − 2.77 0.006\nOrientation × Distance 0.163 0.159 − 1.02 0.306\nFig. 5  A Gripper size during training Blocks with VT versus V \nFeedback conditions.

This allowed us to evaluate Orientation effects on \nEstimation Errors after training regardless of the different \ndistances used for both Orientations. Without any training \neffect, residuals should be around zero. Negative residuals \nwould indicate reduced estimation errors. A tendency for \nreduced estimation errors in proximodistal as compared to \nmediolateral Orientation would result in more data points \nlaying below the diagonal.\nAs illustrated in Fig.  6, there was no tendency that \nresiduals were larger or smaller for the proximodistal Ori-\nentation as compared to the mediolateral Orientation. As \nthe assumption of normality was violated (Shapiro–Wilk \nW = 0.99, p = 0.026), we performed a Wilcoxon Rank test \nto compare both Orientations. Result revealed that resid-\nuals for the mediolateral Orientation (median = -1.66, \nSE = 0.75) were not significantly different than those for \nthe proximodistal Orientation (median = 0.910, SE = 0.951; \nW(233) = 15,214, p = 0.157; cf., Fig. 7).\nThere was also no significant Orientation effect on the \nresiduals when taking Feedback and Test (mid-test, post-\ntest) into account. We fitted a GLM to predict the Resid-\nual Estimation error with Orientation, Test and Feedback. \nThe model’s explanatory power is very weak and not sig-\nnificant (R 2 = 0.013, adj.

Contrary to our prediction, no \nsignificant main or interaction effects could be revealed \nwithin this model (p  = 0.985).\nBody ownership and body agency after virtual \ntool‑use\nDescriptive analysis of ownership and agency revealed val-\nues of − 0.3 ± 0.07 and − 0.8 ± 0.05 for BO and BO-related, \nand 1.4 ± 0.4 and 1.9 ± 0.6 for BA and BA-related, respec-\ntively (means and SE). Thus, only mean values for BA and \nBA-related, but not BO and BO-related, were above 1 as the \nthreshold suggested by Kalckert and Ehrsson (2012, 2014). \nFigure  8 illustrates these findings separated by Feedback \ncondition and Test.\nTo analyse whether the emergence of Ownership and \nAgency was dependent on Feedback, Test, BS plasticity or \nPE, we performed a three-step linear regression separately \nfor Ownership and Agency ratings. In the first step, we ana-\nlysed whether ratings were predicted by Feedback and Test \nor the interaction of Feedback and Test (model 1). In the \nsecond step we added PE (model 2) and in the third step we \nadded TDJ Estimation Error to the regression model (model \n3; cf. Table 5).\nFor BO, model 1 was marginally significant (R 2 = 0.04, \nadj.

The interaction effect in \nmodel 1, between Feedback and Test, indicates that BO rat-\ning decreased in the post-test when V followed the VT con-\ndition but not vice versa (cf. Table 7, and Figs. 9 and 10).\nFor BO-related, model 1 (cf., Table  5) was statisti -\ncally significant (R 2 = 0.09; adj. R2 = 0.08; F(3185) = 6.68; \np < 0.001) and revealed significant effects of Feedback \n(p < 0.001) and Test (p < 0.001), and Feedback × Test inter-\naction effects (p  < 0.001; cf., Table  7). The interaction \neffect demonstrated that ratings where higher for V Feed-\nback condition than the VT condition in the mid-test but \nnot the post-test. Adding PE in model 2 did not improve \nthe initial model (p  = 0.340) and an effect of PE was not \nrevealed (beta  = − 0.493 , SE = 0.516, p = 0.340). Further \nadding Residual Estimation Error in model 3 did also not \nimprove the model (p = 0.679) and also Estimation Error was \nnot significant (beta = 0.002, SE = 0.005, p = 0.679).\nFor BA, model 1 was not significant (R 2 = 0.01, adj. \nR2 = − 0.003; F(3185) = 0.77, p = 0.508). Adding PE in \nmodel 2 marginally significantly improved the initial model \n(p = 0.013; cf., Table  6) and model 2 became margin-\nally significant (R 2 = 0.04, adj.

Larger reduction in gripper size \n(more negative PE values) was associated with higher BA \nratings (cf., Fig.  10). Adding Residual Estimation Error \nin model 3 did not further improve the model ( p = 0.373) \nand no significant effect of Residual Estimation Error was \nrevealed (beta = 0.003, SE = 0.004, p = 0.372).\nFor BA-related, model 1 was significant (R 2 = 0.07, adj. \nR2 = 0.05; F(3185) = 4.60, p = 0.004, cf., Table 5) and a sig-\nnificant effect of Feedback was revealed (beta = − 0.564, \nSE = 0.250, p = 0.025).

While we could confirm that OA were \nable to learn to control the tool as well as YA and develop a \nsense of agency, against our expectations, no BS plasticity \nand no emergence of body ownership was revealed.\nOlder adults are well able to learn controlling \nthe virtual tool\nOlder adults were able to learn to control the virtual tool. \nThe practice effect was of a similar magnitude as previ-\nously described for YA. Results showed that participants \nperformed significantly better and faster during virtual \ntool-use training in both blocks with VT and V feedback \nconditions. However, on average, they had a steeper learn-\ning slope and greater improvement in their performance in \nthe block with VT feedback condition. Thus, in accordance \nwith our behavioural findings, differences in learning effect \nbetween the two blocks are explained by types of feedback \nthey received. In this line, as in YA, the practice effect was \nstronger in the VT feedback condition as compared to the \nV condition indicated by larger reduction in gripper size \n(more negative PE values). This highlights the importance \nof multisensory integration in tool-use learning in older age, \nputting forward the idea that OA perform significantly better \nwhen two sensory stimuli are integrated or combined, rather \nthan relying on only one modality (e.g., vision) without any \ntactile or auditory information (Wahn et al. 2020). Our \nresults are further supported by Mahoney and colleagues \nwho reported that around 75% of OA showed faster per -\nformance in visual-somatosensory testing conditions com-\npared with either vision or somatosensory conditions alone \n(Mahoney et al. 2014). Thus, OA might benefit more from \nmultisensory inputs compared to unisensory ones, although \nintegration of visual-tactile modalities is one of the major \ndifficulties occurring with age (for review; Freiherr et al. \n2013; Mahoney et al. 2014; Costello and Bloesch 2017).\nVirtual tool‑use training did not induce changes \nin the body schema of older adults\nPrevious studies supported the typical and generalised pat-\ntern across young participants that either physical or vir -\ntual tools became incorporated into the existing BS of the \nforearm enlarging the PPS (Jahanian Najafabadi et al. 2022; \nMiller et al. 2014, 2017; Cardinali et al. 2012). In our study, \ndespite the similar strength of the practice effect as in YA, \nwhile direct statistical comparison is not possible, OA did \nnot reveal BS plasticity. This is in line with a study by Cos-\ntello et al. (2015), similarly showing that OA did not exhibit \nany changes in estimation error after tool-use. Their study \nadditionally revealed an overestimation of target distances \nbeyond the PPS both during the use of a tool and during \npointing to a target with their hand. Besides age-related \ndecline in representational plasticity, it might also be that \ndue to a decline in visuo-spatial processing and mental trans-\nformations and thus impaired multisensory information less \nalterations of the BS are induced (Devlin and Wilson 2010; \nKochunov et al. 2005; Lehmbeck et al. 2006; Makin et al. \n2007). Previous researchers (Devlin and Wilson 2010; Gha-\nfouri and Lestienne 2000) suggested that, to form a stable \nspatial representation of the body, older people, compared \nto younger ones, show less flexibility when integrating new \nsensory information. BS plasticity in OA was independ-\nent of feedback conditions. While from previous studies, \none would expect that multisensory integration is required \nfor recalibrating bodily information by synchronous visual \ninputs (Costello and Bloeesch 2017), one might speculate \nthat such multisensory integration is affected in OA due to \ndecrease in unisensory process (Stein and Stanford 2008). \nAltered sensory representations with less precise body and \nspace representations (Sorrentino et al. 2021) and reduced \nprocessing speed (Costello and Bloeesch 2017) might \ncontribute to this effect, e.g., through unmatched timing. \nReduced multisensory integration might also be related to \nreduction in attentional resources and attentional capaci -\nties in one specific modality (Hugenschmidt et al. 2009). \nFurther, decreased attentional capacities in OA could also \nexplain their slower sensory processing (Riis et al. 2009).\nAdditionally, the ability of OA to perform visuo-motor \nremapping may be impaired, as older adults do not experi-\nence changes in their perceived distance to targets as a result \nof tool-use as young adults do (Caçola et al. 2013; Costello \net al. 2015; Kuehn et al. 2018).\nAnother explanation for the fact that we could not confirm \nlarger TDJ errors in proximodistal as compared to medi-\nolateral directions could be based on age-related changes in \nsomatosensory cortical processing. OA have larger receptive \nfields likely caused by reduced intracortical inhibition. As a \nconsequence, neuronal responses may become more broadly \ntuned and receptive fields larger. Assuming that anisotropy \nTable 6  Model comparison \nof the three linear regression \nmodels for Ownership and \nAgency variables\nComparison BO BO-related BA BA-related\nΔR2 F P ΔR2 F P ΔR2 F P ΔR2 F P\nModel 1 vs. 2 0.00 0.03 0.858 0.01 0.91 0.340 0.03 6.28 0.013 0.01 1.095 0.297\nModel 2 vs. 3 0.01 2.17 0.142 0.00 0.17 0.679 0.01 0.79 0.373 0.00 0.026 0.871\n1751Experimental Brain Research (2023) 241:1739–1756 \n1 3\nof receptive fields is based on intracortical inhibition, recep-\ntive fields should get larger particularly in mediolateral \ndirection, resulting in increased estimation errors (Lenz et al. \n2012; Pleger et al. 2016).\n Tanaka (2021) revealed that internal body models rep-\nresented by the BS and BI are at the core of motor learn-\ning. While the BI is necessary for the initial phase of motor \nlearning, the BS is a prerequisite for the advancement of \nmotor learning in the next phases by incorporation of new \nways of movement that updates constantly and uncon-\nsciously. The repetitive movement of body parts during \nmotor practice leads to the improvement of performance by \nrequiring the learner to develop a new set of processes asso-\nciated with practice, consciousness and mental processes \nwhen doing the task. Therefore, given that BS plasticity was \nnot observed in our study in spite of motor learning, the \nquestion still remains whether BS plasticity is a prerequisite \nfor any type of motor learning or vice versa.\nChanges in ownership and agency were not related \nto altered body schema\nAs expected, participants developed a modified sense of \nagency during training which was predicted by the practice \neffect but not BS plasticity. Findings suggest that even in \nOA, agency may strongly relate to improvement in tool-use, \nrather than depending on changes in plastic reorganisation \nof the sensorimotor representation. Previous research in \nYA indicated that haptic feedback influences the BR and \nour interaction with virtual objects while grasping (Krog-\nmeier et al. 2019 ). For example, haptic feedback in VR \nmight improve performance by making our experience of \ninteracting with objects more realistic (Kappers, 2011). \nHowever, although the practice effect was stronger after VT \nfeedback as compared to V feedback and agency increased \nwith practice effect, no clear dependency of agency on feed-\nback condition could be revealed. Rather, BA-related rat-\nings were higher in the V condition as compared to the VT \ncondition indicating that other factors also must be involved \nnot assessed in this study. Probably, in case of conflicting \ninformation, OA more relied on the visual input to control \nthe virtual tool. Another explanation might be that agency \nratings were very high in all conditions and thus a ceiling \neffect might have masked the effect of feedback condition \nin agency ratings.\nHowever, against our hypothesis and contrary to previous \nstudies that revealed decreased levels of subjective feeling of \nownership experience in the RHI in OA (Kállai et al. 2017; \nGraham et al. 2014), our results revealed no emergence of \nownership during tool-use training. Further research also \nrevealed lower agency and ownership in OA compared to \nYA and concluded that OA generally experience an attenu-\nated sense of agency and ownership (Cioffi et al. 2017).

This \ntouches upon the idea that OA might be less susceptible \nto the RHI but not to the embodiment of tools in general \n(Weser and Proffitt, 2021 ) indicating that RHI compared \nwith tools incorporated into the body and not extending it. \nWe speculate that OA may need longer training with virtual \ntools to induce BS plasticity and a sense of ownership and \nthat tasks must rely even more on multisensory integration. \nCombined, more work is still needed in order to fully under-\nstand the underlying mechanisms and the association of \nownership, and agency with changes in BS plasticity and BI.\nLimitations\nSome limitations of our study need to be addressed: Results \ncannot be directly compared with our previous study in YA \nas these are two separate studies using the same experimen-\ntal design but at different physical laboratories and loca-\ntions. Another limitation is that in our study, visual channels \nalways existed on top of haptic feedback and this modality \ncouldn’t be controlled during the training. This only allowed \nus to control and evaluate the contribution of vibrotactile \nfeedback. Therefore, we suggest that future studies should \ntake the advantage of AR to study malleability of the senso-\nrimotor BS in new experimentally controlled and ecologi-\ncally valid paradigms, including modulation of the visual \nmodality.\nConclusions and outlook\nWe conclude that a sense of agency may strongly relate to \nimprovement in tool-use in OA dependent on the PE but \nindependent of alterations in the BS, while ownership did \nnot emerge due to a lack of BS plasticity.\nWe suggest that the future studies should take advantage \nof AR methods to easily isolate and manipulate sensory \ninformation. This could very much contribute to our under-\nstanding of age differences in the emergence of ownership \nand agency during tool-use training and whether training \nwith different sensory modalities would improve the learn-\ning outcome, or reduce the effect due to a conflict between \ndifferent sensory modalities.
