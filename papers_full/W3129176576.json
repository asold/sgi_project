INTRODUCTION\nAs an essential part of urban rail transit, the traction\ntransformer operation’s reliability depends on its insula-\ntion performance [1], [2]. The traction transformer’s insu-\nlation performance is closely related to the heat generation\nand heat dissipation inside the traction transformer [3], [4].\nThe traction transformer’s operation instability or damage is\nmainly due to the temperature of the transformer windings\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Hui Ma\n.\nexceeding the insulating material limit’s thermal resistance.\nTherefore, the accurate prediction of HST for traction trans-\nformer is of great signiﬁcance to improve the traction trans-\nformer operation’s reliability and ensure the train’s stable\noperation [5], [6].\nThe research of oil-paper insulation of the transformer has\nreceived extensive attention [7]–[9], and the aging mecha-\nnism of oil-paper insulation have been fully studied. Insu-\nlation aging is closely related to the internal temperature\nﬁeld of the transformer. The measurement and calculation of\nthe transformer’s internal temperature ﬁeld have been a hot\nVOLUME 9, 2021 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Zhanget al.: Prediction Model of Hot Spot Temperature for Split-Windings Traction Transformer Considering the Load Characteristics\ntopic for many scholars. The existing research on the trans-\nformer temperature ﬁeld is mainly divided into three meth-\nods: direct measurement method, thermal circuit method,\nand the numerical analysis method. The direct measurement\nmethod directly measures HST through ﬁber optic tem-\nperature sensors installed inside the transformer. However,\nthe cost of ﬁber optic instruments is relatively high and is not\nsuitable for large-scale applications. Besides, the presence of\nﬁber optic instruments will affect the heat dissipation inside\nthe transformer. Considered the similarity between electrical\nand heat-transfer phenomena, the thermal circuit method is\noften used to calculate the HST of the transformer. However,\nthe key parameters, such as thermal capacity and resistance\nin the thermal circuit are challenging to obtain.\nIn recent years, with the development of numerical cal-\nculation technology, the research on the internal tempera-\nture ﬁeld by the numerical analysis method has gradually\nincreased [10]–[12]. D. Kweon measured the HST of the\ntransformer, which was ﬁlled with mineral oil and natural\nester liquid, respectively, with optical ﬁber sensors [13].\nBased on the ﬂow heat ﬁeld calculation, Y. Deng combined\nsupport vector regression to predict the HST of the trans-\nformer [14]. T. Dao and B. T. Phung used the COMSOL\nsimulation software to solve the heat equation and the free\nconvection equation and studied the temperature rise inside\nthe oil-immersed transformer [15]. C. Liu established two\naccurate two-dimensional models to calculate the windings’\nenergy loss and studied the temperature ﬁeld of the dry-type\ntransformer by combining indirect coupling and sequential\ncoupling [16]. Most scholars’ research on the temperature\nﬁeld focuses on load rating or small load ﬂuctuation, which\nis not suitable for dynamic load changes.\nThe operating environment of the traction transformer is\nquite complicated. When the train passes through the power\nsupply interval at high speed or with a heavy load, the traction\ntransformer is overloaded. The temperature of the windings\nrises sharply. The traction transformer restores the aver-\nage load after the train passes. Due to the traction load’s\nparticularity, the traction transformer internal temperature\nﬁeld variation law is different from the power transformer.\nThus, insulation aging is also different from that of the\npower transformer [17], [18]. Based on the equivalent thermal\ncircuit [19], [20] and the parameter optimized equivalent\nthermal circuit [21]–[23], many scholars have discussed the\ntransformer modeling problem considering load characteris-\ntics. In the transformer temperature ﬁeld research using the\nnumerical analysis method, the transformer’s load character-\nistics are rarely considered. It is necessary to further study the\ntemperature ﬁeld of traction transformer under dynamic load\nchanges.\nIn view of the above issues, the prediction model of HST\nfor traction transformer is established in this paper. The ﬂow\nchart of 3D coupled Fluid-Solid-Thermal analysis is shown\nin Fig. 1. The present ﬁndings of urban rail transit load\nshow that the traction transformer’s load variation can be\nwell simulated by combining steady load with step load.\nFIGURE 1. Flow chart of 3D coupled fluid-solid-thermal analysis.\nBased on the actual loss of traction transformer, according\nto the theory of heat transfer and ﬂuid mechanics, the tem-\nperature ﬁeld coupling calculation is carried out according\nto the VI normative duty class. On this basis, the traction\ntransformer’s temperature ﬁeld under the different load rates\nis calculated according to different working conditions of the\ntraction transformer. The transformer temperature rise test\nveriﬁes the effectiveness of the proposed method. The anal-\nysis method can predict the HST of the traction transformer\nunder different working conditions and provide a reference\nfor operation scheduling and ﬁxed-point monitoring of the\ntraction transformer.\nII. ANALYSIS METHOD\nA. HEAT GENERATION ANALYSIS\n1) LOSS ANALYSIS UNDER RATED LOAD\nDuring the traction transformer operation, the iron core,\nwindings, and other iron components will all suffer losses\ndue to the existence of resistance and reluctance. These losses\nare converted into heat, part of which is dissipated into the\nsurrounding air, the other part increases the components’ tem-\nperature. The increase in temperature will further enlarge the\nloss. The internal heating of the traction transformer mainly\ncomes from loss [24], [25], and the expressions of loss are as\nfollows:\nPT =PNL +PLL (1)\n\n\nPNL =Phl +Pcl\nPhl =ηf B 1.6\nmaxV ×10−3\nPcl =ηd2f 2B2\nmaxV ×10−3\n(2)\nwhere, PT is the total loss of the traction transformer,\nPNL is no-load loss, PLL is load loss, Phl is magnetic hys-\nteresis loss, Pcl is eddy-current loss, ηis the hysteresis factor\nof the iron core, f is the power supply frequency, Bmax is the\n22606 VOLUME 9, 2021\nY. Zhanget al.: Prediction Model of Hot Spot Temperature for Split-Windings Traction Transformer Considering the Load Characteristics\nmaximum ﬂux density, V is the volume of the iron core, d is\nthe thickness of silicon steel sheet.\nIn the load loss, the DC loss of windings accounts for the\nmajority. The stray loss of other iron structures includes the\ntransformer bracket, transformer shell, yoke, only accounts\nfor a small proportion, and can be ignored. In practical cal-\nculation, it is considered that the DC loss is equal to the load\nloss. The expression of load loss is as follows:\nPLL =I2\nHN rHN,75◦C +I2\nLN rLN,75◦C (3)\nwhere, IHN (ILN ) is the rated current of the HV (LV) windings,\nrHN,75◦C (rLN,75◦C ) is the total resistance of the HV (LV)\nwindings when converted to 75 ◦C.\nThere are three heat sources in the operation of traction\ntransformer: the heat converted by core loss, the heat con-\nverted by internal loss of the LV windings, and the heat\nconverted by internal loss of the HV windings [26]. The heat\ngenerated by the dielectric loss of the traction transformer’s\ninsulation material is ignored in this paper because the mag-\nnitude of the loss is relatively small [27]. The no-load loss\nof traction transformer is little affected by temperature and\nis set as a constant heat source. Most of the load loss is\nDC loss, which is positively correlated with temperature and\nproportional to the load rate’s square. The resistivity of the\nmetal at temperature t is as follows [28]:\nρ=ρ0(1 +αt) (4)\nwhere, ρ0 is the resistivity of the metal at 0 ◦C, αis the temper-\nature coefﬁcient of the metal. In this paper, the temperature\ncoefﬁcient of copper is 0.00393.\nThe loss of the HV and LV windings at temperature t is as\nfollows, respectively [29]:\n{\nPf =Ph ·[1 +α·(t −t0)]\nPS =Pl ·[1 +α·(t −t0)] (5)\nwhere, Ph and Pl are the loss of the HV and LV windings at\nt0, t is the temperature of the windings, t0 is 75◦C.\n2) LOSS ANALYSIS UNDER STEP LOAD\nIn practical application, it is not easy to calculate with an\naccurate load curve. For the steady load transformer and\nthe steady load transformer with a superimposed step load,\nthe load cycle curve is represented by a constant current\nvalue or working system level within the speciﬁed duration.\nIEC 146-1-1 (1991) [30] gives six normative duty classes.\nThe deﬁnition of VI normative duty class is showed as 1.0p.u.\ncontinuous, 1.5p.u.2h, 3.0p.u. 1min. The cyclic load curve of\nthe VI normative duty class is shown in Fig. 2.\nThe repeated cyclic load is equivalently converted into a\nsteady load through the root mean square calculation. The\ncalculation is divided into two stages, and the calculation\nFIGURE 2. Load cycle example of VI normative duty class.\nresults are presented in Table 1.\nPi =\n\n√\nn∑\nj=1\np2\nj ·tj\nn∑\nj=1\ntj\ni =1,2,..., n (6)\nThis conversion method is also applicable to other working\nconditions. According to the root mean square calculation,\nthe load cycle curve is represented by the combination of\nsteady load and step load.\nTABLE 1. Root mean square value of the load cycle curve.\nwhere, Pi is the equivalent steady load converted, tj is the\nduration of load pj. n is the number of different load currents\n(Id ) in the load cycle.\nThe functional schematic diagram of the traction station\nis shown in Fig. 3. In typical operation, a traction station is\nresponsible for providing power for the station and the two\nadjacent stations in the up and down direction, with a load\nroot value of 1.0p.U. and a possible maximum peak load\nof 1.76p.U. with a duration of less than 0.5 min. Suppose\na traction station (station B) exits operation due to fault\nor maintenance within a certain period. The two adjacent\ntraction stations (station A and station C) need to bear 50%\nof the faulty station’s load. The maximum bearing time is\n2 hours. Currently, each station’s square root value is about\n1.5p.U., and the possible maximum peak load is 2.64p.U.\nFIGURE 3. Functional diagram of traction station.\nVOLUME 9, 2021 22607\nY. Zhanget al.: Prediction Model of Hot Spot Temperature for Split-Windings Traction Transformer Considering the Load Characteristics\nwith a duration of within 1 minute. The above characteristics\nof the traction load are consistent with the deﬁnition of\nVI normative duty class. In order to simulate the traction\nload characteristics, the temperature ﬁeld distribution of the\ntraction transformer is simulated and analyzed under the\nVI normative duty class. In the process, the loss of the HV\nand LV windings at load rate k is as follows, respectively:\n\n\n\nPf =K2 ·Ph ·K0\nPS =K2 ·Pl ·K0\nK0 =1 +0.00393 ·\n(\nt −75◦C\n) (7)\nwhere, K is the load rate of the traction transformer, K0 is the\nloss correction factor.\nThe iron core, LV windings, and HV windings are treated\nas uniform heating bodies. The heat generation rate can be\nexpressed as follows:\nQ =P/Ve (8)\nwhere, Q is the heating generation rate of the iron core\n(windings), P is the loss of the iron core (windings), and Ve is\nthe equivalent volume of the iron core (windings).\nThrough the above analysis of the traction transformer loss,\nthe simulation model’s load data are obtained. The core loss\ndata is calculated by equation (2), and the windings loss data\nis calculated by equation (3) and equation (7). The calculation\nresults are presented in Table 2.\nTABLE 2. Load data of the traction transformer.\nB. HEAT DISSIPATION ANALYSIS\nThe heat dissipation methods of the traction transformer\ninclude heat conduction, convection, and radiation. The heat\ntransfer inside the windings, the iron core, and the insulating\nresin mainly depend on heat conduction. The surface of the\niron core, LV and HV windings are in contact with air, and\nthe heat is transferred through convection. Moreover, the iron\ncore, LV and HV windings, and the surrounding environment\ninteract through radiation.\nIn the simulation of convection problems, it is critical to\ndetermine whether the ﬂow is laminar or turbulence. Four\nevaluation indicators are proposed to determine the gas ﬂow\ntype: Reynolds number, Grashof number, Rayleigh number,\nand Prandtl number. Rayleigh number is used for evaluation\nin this paper, and its expression is as follows [31]:\nRa =gαp1Th3\nκν (9)\nwhere, g is the gravitational acceleration, αp is the thermal\nexpansion coefﬁcient of air, 1T is the temperature difference,\nh is the height of the convective object, k is the thermal\ndiffusion coefﬁcient of air, νis the kinematic viscosity.\nThe simulation and test are carried out in an environ-\nment of 30 ◦C. After calculation, the Rayleigh number is less\nthan 1 ·109;the simulation model’s airﬂow state is laminar.\nC. CONTROL EQUATIONS\nIn the Fluid-Solid-Thermal coupling model, the ﬂow of air\nis obtained by the Navier-Stokes ﬂuid equation, the ﬂuid\nheat transfer control equation and solid heat transfer control\nequation are used for the ﬁnite element calculation of temper-\nature distribution. The heat source in the heat transfer control\nequation comes from the loss of heating during the traction\ntransformer operation.\nApplying the Navier-Stokes ﬂuid equation to air, the con-\ntrol equation is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nρ∂u\n∂t +ρ(u ·∇)u =∇· [−ρI +τ] +F +ρg\n∂ρ\n∂t +∇· (ρ·u) =0\nτ =µ(∇u +(∇u)T ) −2\n3µ(∇·u)I\n(10)\nwhere, ρ is the density of the ﬂuid, u is a velocity vector of\nthe ﬂuid, I is the identity matrix, µis the power viscosity,\nT is the temperature of the ﬂuid, F is the volume force\n(general default is 0).\nApplying the heat transfer physics to all areas, the control\nequation is as follows:\n\n\n\nρCp\n∂T\n∂t +ρCp1u ·∇T +∇· q =Q\nq =−k ·∇T\n(11)\nwhere, Cp is the solid constant pressure heat capacity, Cp1 is\nthe ﬂuid constant pressure heat capacity, q is the local heat\nﬂux density, k is the thermal conductivity.\nIII. ESTABLISHMENT OF SIMULATION MODEL\nA. THE ESTABLISHED 3D GEOMETRIC MODEL\nThis paper takes a step-down transformer of 35kV traction\nstation as the prototype, model ZQSC-L-2500/35, insulation\nclass F, as shown in Fig. 4. There are air channels between\nthe iron core, LV and HV windings. Both the LV and HV\nwindings are designed to be split into inner and outer layers to\nenhance heat dissipation. The basic parameters of the traction\ntransformer are shown in Table 3.\nTABLE 3. Basic parameters of the traction transformer.\n22608 VOLUME 9, 2021\nY. Zhanget al.: Prediction Model of Hot Spot Temperature for Split-Windings Traction Transformer Considering the Load Characteristics\nFIGURE 4. ZQSC-L-2500/35 traction transformer.\nAccording to the actual structure of the traction trans-\nformer, the corresponding three-dimensional numerical cal-\nculation model is established. The structure of the traction\ntransformer is quite complicated. In order to reduce the\namount of calculation, the structure of the traction trans-\nformer is simpliﬁed as follows:\n1) The actual iron core is made of silicon steel sheets, and\nits cross-section is approximately circular. In order to reduce\nthe amount of calculation, the iron core is smoothed.\n2) There is a layer of turn-insulating between each turn\nof windings. Because the insulation is very thin, it has little\ninﬂuence on the heat dissipation of the windings. In this\nstudy, the turn-insulating is ignored.\n3) To simplify the calculation, the clamps, brackets, and\ninsulating tubes of the traction transformer are ignored.\nB. THE INITIAL VALUE AND BOUNDARY CONDITIONS OF\nSIMULATION\nAccording to the traction transformer’s operating environ-\nment and heat dissipation conditions, the reasonable initial\nvalue and boundary conditions are set up.\n1) The on-site traction transformer is installed indoors.\nThe ambient temperature is set at 30 ◦C. Set the material\nparameters separately according to the speciﬁc materials used\nin each part of the actual traction transformer. The parameter\nsettings are shown in Table 4.\n2) Fluid ﬁeld boundary conditions [32]. The traction trans-\nformer is installed in the cabinet during actual operation. The\ncold air enters from the bottom, and the hot air ﬂows out from\nthe top of the cabinet under natural convection. The initial\nambient wind speed is set as a breeze, which is 0.1m/s.\n3) Heat transfer boundary conditions. The solid heat trans-\nfer physics is used in all areas except the air area. The\ninitial temperature is determined by each part of the traction\ntransformer’s temperature at the beginning of the temperature\nrise test. The air area uses ﬂuid heat transfer physics. The\nconvective heat ﬂux is applied to the air region to simulate\nthe cooling effect of air. The convective heat ﬂux can be\nexpressed as follows:\nq =h ·(Text −T ) (12)\nTABLE 4. Material parameters setting.\nwhere, q is heat ﬂux, h is the heat transfer coefﬁcient, Text is\nthe external temperature, T is the temperature of the ﬂuid.\nC. MESHING\nThe grid division directly affects the calculation accuracy and\nthe amount of calculation. In order to reduce the amount of\ncomputation under the premise of ensuring the calculation\naccuracy, the principle of reﬁning the grid of critical com-\nponents is adopted. The LV and HV windings’ grid size is set\nto be more reﬁned, and the grid size of the iron core and air\narea is set to be coarser. The traction transformer’s geometric\nmodel meshes with a free tetrahedral network, and skewness\nis used to measure the simulation model’s grid quality. The\nmesh model shown in Fig. 5 can be obtained. The closer the\nvalue is to 1, the higher the mesh quality is. In general, a value\nof less than 0.1 is not allowed. After grid division, the average\nelement quality is 0.5858, and the number of elements of the\nsimulation model is 552558. The geometric parameters of the\ntraction transformer’s windings and iron core of the traction\ntransformer are shown in Table 5 and Table 6.\nFIGURE 5. Quality diagram of grid division for the traction transformer.\nTABLE 5. Geometric parameters of the traction transformer windings.\nVOLUME 9, 2021 22609\nY.

Geometric parameters of the traction transformer core.\nIV. SIMULATION RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nA. ANALYSIS OF SIMULATION RESULTS UNDER RATED\nLOAD\nThis simulation object is a dry-type transformer used in the\ntraction station. The simulation calculation is based on the\nactual traction transformer, which is convenient compared\nto the temperature rise test’s value. First, the traction trans-\nformer’s temperature ﬁeld is calculated under the rated load,\nand the simulation results are shown in Fig. 6.\nFIGURE 6. The temperature distribution of (a) Overall traction\ntransformer, (b) Iron core, (c) LV windings, (d) HV windings.\nAs shown in Fig. 6, the traction transformer’s temperature\nﬁeld distribution is low-high-low from the bottom to the top.\nThe outer layer of HV windings is located at the outermost\nlayer of the traction transformer. It has the right heat dis-\nsipation conditions, and the temperature distribution law is\nnot as apparent as the inner layer. Comparing Fig. 6 (c) with\nFig. 6 (d), the heat dissipation condition of the outer layer\nof HV windings is better than that of the inner layer. The\noverall temperature distribution of the inner layer is higher\nthan that of the outer layer. The heat dissipation condition\nof the LV windings’ outer layer is also better than that of the\ninner layer. However, the loss of the outer layer is much larger\nthan the inner layer due to the traction transformer’s design,\nwhich results in a higher overall temperature distribution of\nthe outer layer of LV windings.\nThe hot spot is the key point of the research on the tem-\nperature ﬁeld of the traction transformer. This paper takes\nthe outer layer of LV windings and the inner layer of HV\nwindings as the primary research objects (in the following,\nLV windings speciﬁcally refer to the outer layer of LV wind-\nings, and HV windings speciﬁcally refer to the inner layer of\nHV windings). The temperature rises process of the LV and\nHV windings under the rated load is shown in Fig. 7.\nFIGURE 7. Longitudinal temperature rise process of (a) LV windings,\n(b) HV windings.\nAs shown in Fig. 7, the longitudinal temperature distribu-\ntion curve shows a low-high-low parabola distribution due to\nthe inﬂuence of wall viscosity. In the ﬁgure, the abscissa is\nthe longitudinal height of the LV and HV windings. The tem-\nperature increases with height and then gradually decreases\nafter reaching the maximum. The temperature rises speed is\nfast at the beginning of the simulation. With the increase of\ntime, the rising speed of temperature slows down. Finally,\nthe temperature ﬁeld tends to be stable. The reason is that\nthe thermal convection is not fully formed at the begin-\nning. The internal heat transfer of the traction transformer\nis mainly through heat conduction and radiation, and heat\ndissipation is not apparent; with the increase of working time,\nthe effect of convective heat dissipation gradually increases.\nFinally, the balance of heat generation and heat dissipation is\nachieved, the traction transformer’s temperature ﬁeld tends to\nbe stable. In the process of temperature rise, the location of\nHST remains unchanged.\nAfter the temperature ﬁeld is stable, the LV and HV wind-\nings’ temperature distribution is shown in Fig. 8. The HST of\nLV windings is 82 ◦C, located at about 72% of the height of\n22610 VOLUME 9, 2021\nY.

Longitudinal temperature curve of LV windings and HV\nwindings under rated load.\nLV windings; the HST of HV windings is 98 ◦C, located at\nabout 70% of the height of HV windings.\nB. ANALYSIS OF SIMULATION RESULTS UNDER STEP\nLOAD\nThe traction transformer’s actual operating environment is\nquite complex, and the traction transformer is often in the\nstate of short-time overload. Due to the particularity of trac-\ntion load, in order to obtain the accurate distribution of tem-\nperature ﬁeld, the step load is added for further study based\non steady load according to the requirements of VI normative\nduty class. The hot spots of the LV and HV windings are taken\nas the research node. The temperature rise process of HST is\nstudied, as shown in Fig. 9.\nAs shown in Fig. 9, the step load is applied after the temper-\nature ﬁeld of the traction transformer reaches a steady state.\nThe temperature increased rapidly, and cannot reach a steady\nstate at the end of the test. The reason is that the internal\nheat source increases instantaneously as the load changes, and\nthe increase in heat dissipation cannot keep up with the heat\ngeneration. At the end of the simulation calculation, the LV\nand HV windings’ longitudinal temperature distribution is\nshown in Fig. 10.\nAs shown in Fig. 10, the trend of longitudinal temperature\ndistribution is consistent with the steady temperature ﬁeld,\nand the curve of longitudinal temperature distribution is a\nparabola of low-high-low. The location of the hot spots in the\nLV windings and the HV windings is almost unchanged, and\nthe temperature of the hot spots has changed. The HST of\nLV windings is 131 ◦C, located at about 70% of the height of\nLV windings; the HST of HV windings is 161 ◦C, located at\nabout 70% of the height of HV windings.\nC. INFLUENCE OF STEP LOAD WITH DIFFERENT LOAD\nRATES\nThe traction transformer will encounter different working\nconditions in actual operation. There are different require-\nments for their load capacity under different working con-\nditions. Different working conditions can be represented by\ndifferent combinations of steady load and step load. In order\nFIGURE 9. The temperature rise process of (a) LV windings hot spot,\n(b) HV windings hot spot.\nFIGURE 10. Longitudinal temperature curve of LV windings and HV\nwindings under step load.\nto obtain the HST of the traction transformer under different\nworking conditions, it is necessary to calculate the temper-\nature ﬁeld of the traction transformer under different load\nrates. Apply 100% rated load to the traction transformer,\nand then apply step load at different load rates after the\ntraction transformer’s temperature ﬁeld is stable. The hot spot\nlocation of the traction transformer is selected as the research\nnode. The ambient temperature is 30 ◦C, and the simulation\ntime of step load is 2 hours. This model takes a value every\n0.2 h from the simulation time range (10 h-12 h) to study\nthe HST’s effects under different load rates. The simulation\nresults are shown in Fig. 11.\nAs shown in Fig. 11, the temperature rises rapidly with\nthe application of the step load. The higher the load rate,\nthe faster the temperature rises. The temperature rise of the\nVOLUME 9, 2021 22611\nY. Zhanget al.: Prediction Model of Hot Spot Temperature for Split-Windings Traction Transformer Considering the Load Characteristics\nFIGURE 11.

The fitting curves of hot spot temperature change of the\ntraction transformer under different load rates.\ntraction transformer is approximately linear with simulation\ntime. In order to obtain the general functional relationship\nbetween time and HST under different load rates, the ﬁtting\nanalysis is carried out to studied the variation law of HST vs.\nsimulation time under different load rates. The ﬁtting curves\nare shown in Fig. 12, and the obtained ﬁtting equations are\ntabulated in Table 7. These formulas can be used to study\nthe inﬂuence of different load rates on traction transformer\noperation and provide a reference for load dispatch.\nD. DISCUSSION\nThe traction transformer studied in this paper is the dry-type\ntransformer, insulation grade is F. The international standard\nIEC 60076-11-2004 [33] speciﬁes the temperature rise limit\nof a dry-type transformer. For dry-type transformer coil with\nclass F insulation material, the limit working temperature\nis 155 ◦C, and the maximum temperature rise should be less\nthan 100k. According to the simulation results, the HST of\nthe traction transformer is 161 ◦C, and the maximum tem-\nperature rise is 131k, which has greatly exceeded the limit\nvalue of class F insulation. The HST directly affects the\nperformance of insulation materials. The insulation of the\ntraction transformer will be signiﬁcantly damaged under this\nworking temperature.\nTABLE 7. The obtained fitting equations of hot spot temperature vs.\nsimulation time under different load rates.\nIn order to prolong the operating life of the traction trans-\nformer, it is necessary to adjust and control the traction\nload reasonably. Set the critical temperature as 130 ◦C. The\ntime required for HST to reach the limit is different under\ndifferent load rates. The larger the load rate, the shorter the\ntime required for HST to reach the limit. The step load of\nthe VI normative duty class is 150% rated load. In order to\navoid or reduce the temperature overrun time, the following\nsuggestions are put forward:\n1) If it is in peak operation, it is challenging to reduce train\nfrequency. According to the ﬁtting equation shown in Table 7,\nthe time required for HST to reach 130 ◦C is 0.81 hours.\nIn other words, in order to avoid damaging the traction\ntransformer’s insulation performance, the fault station should\nbe put into operation again within 0.81 hours to restore the\nnormal load of two heavy haul traction stations.\n2) If the fault cannot be eliminated in a short time, the train\nfrequency must be reduced. According to the simulation\nresults in Fig. 11, the HST is below 130 ◦C when the traction\ntransformer’s load rate is less than 130% rated load. In other\nwords, it is necessary to reduce the train frequency to keep\nthe equivalent load rate below 130% rated load to ensure the\nsafe and stable operation of the train.\nV. TEMPERATURE RISE TEST AND VERIFICATION\nIn order to verify the numerical calculation method’s accu-\nracy, the temperature rise test is carried out by the simu-\nlated load method. The temperature change of the iron core,\nLV windings, and HV windings is measured by the temper-\nature sensor. The temperature rise of windings is determined\nby the combination of the no-load test and the short-circuit\ntest. When the windings pass through the rated current and\nthe core is rated excitation, the temperature rise expression of\nwindings is shown as follows:\n1θc∗=1θc\n[\n1 +(1θe/1θc)1/k\n]k\n(13)\nwhere, 1θe is the windings temperature rise under no-load\ntest, 1θc is the windings temperature rise under short-circuit\n22612 VOLUME 9, 2021\nY. Zhanget al.: Prediction Model of Hot Spot Temperature for Split-Windings Traction Transformer Considering the Load Characteristics\nFIGURE 13. Schematic diagram of temperature rise test.\nFIGURE 14. The comparison and relative error of measured values and\ncalculated curves. (a) Phase A, (b) Phase B, (c) Phase C.\ntest, k is the temperature coefﬁcient. For the self-cooling\ntransformer, k is taken as 0.8.\nThe temperature rise test is carried out following the\nrequirements of the power transformer test guide (IEC 60726-\n1982) [34] and Part 11 dry-type transformer of the power\ntransformer (IEC 60076-11-2004). The schematic diagram of\nthe temperature rise test is shown in Fig. 13. In the tempera-\nture rise test, the iron core, HV windings, and LV windings of\nthree phases are set with measuring points, respectively. The\nmeasuring points are placed at the hot spots of each part, and a\ntotal of nine measuring points are set. The applied test current\nis the rated current until the temperature ﬁeld is stable. When\nthe temperature rise is less than 1 ◦C per hour, it is considered\nthat the temperature ﬁeld tends to be stable. The temperature\nat each measuring point is measured once an hour, and the\ntemperature rise test lasts for 9 hours.\nAccording to equation (13), the measured values of each\nmeasuring point can be obtained. The comparison of mea-\nsured values of measuring points and calculated curves is\ndrawn in Fig. 14. Depending on the observation of the mea-\nsured value and the calculated value in Fig. 14, the two values\nare in good agreement within the test’s period except for\nindividual data points. In order to quantitatively analyze the\ncorrelation between the calculated value and the measured\nvalue, the relative error between the measured value and the\ncalculated value is calculated point by point using equation\n(14). The calculation results are also presented in Fig. 14.\nRe =|T ∗−T |\nT ×100% (14)\nwhere, Re is the relative error, T∗is the calculated temperature\nvalue, T is the measured value.\nAfter calculation, the maximum/minimum relative error is\n6%/0.3%. The average values of relative error at measuring\npoints of three phases are 3.3%, 3.7%, and 3.2%. Thus, this\npaper’s analysis method can simulate the actual operation\nof the traction transformer, and calculate the distribution\nand change of temperature ﬁeld of the traction transformer\naccurately relatively.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, the 2200kV A traction transformer is the research\nobject. A prediction model of HST is established based on\nthe solid ﬁeld, ﬂuid ﬁeld, and heat transfer ﬁeld. Through\nthe iterative calculation of the temperature ﬁeld, the traction\ntransformer’s temperature ﬁeld under VI normative duty class\nis analyzed. On this basis, the inﬂuence of load factor and\ntime on the HST of traction transformer is studied. The\npresent ﬁndings can be concluded as follows:\n1) In practical application, it is not easy to calculate with an\naccurate load curve. By combining the steady load and step\nload, the traction transformer’s load change can be well sim-\nulated. Different combinations of steady load and step load\ncan be used to predict the traction transformer’s temperature\nﬁeld under different working conditions.\n2) The temperature rise test of the actual traction trans-\nformer is carried out. The maximum deviation between the\ntest data and the simulation data is 6%. The average relative\nerror is 3.4%, which is within the allowable error range of the\nproject. The analysis method of combining temperature rise\ntest with numerical simulation can effectively avoid the insu-\nlation loss caused by the overload test of traction transformer.\n3) The temperature ﬁeld of the traction transformer is\nstudied according to the VI normative duty class. The sim-\nulation results show that the HST of the traction transformer\nis 98◦C at rated load, the HST is 161 ◦C at step load. The hot\nspot is located at about 70% of the height of HV windings.\nIn order to avoid damage to the insulation performance of\nVOLUME 9, 2021 22613\nY.

The equations\nof HST vs. simulation time under different load rates are\nobtained. These equations can provide a reference for the\neffect of load rate and time on the on-site traction transformer.\nAccording to the HST equations, the operation load could be\nadjusted reasonably to avoid or reduce the overload time of\nthe traction transformer and prolong traction transformer life.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to thank the test support provided by\nGuangxi Liuzhou Special Transformer Company Ltd.\nREFERENCES\n[1] J.
