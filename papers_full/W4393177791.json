Various\ntime series data (e.g., stock price, traffic flow, electricity) present\nunique challenges and opportunities for computational analysis,\neach requiring tailored approaches to effectively capture their in-\nherent properties. The analysis and understanding of time series\ndata is an important piece of data mining, facilitating crucial in-\nsights and decisions in many domains [46, 94], including finance\n[19, 108], healthcare [52, 62], cloud computing [116], environments\n[14, 70], energy [123], and urban computing [79, 88].\nIn recent years, the advancements of deep learning, especially\nthe transformer-based models [85], have revolutionized the field of\ntime series analysis [95]. Following the pioneering work [54], there\nhas been a surge in research interest exploring the application of\narXiv:2403.14735v3  [cs.LG]  18 Jun 2024\nKDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain Yuxuan Liang et al.\nTable 1: Comparison between our survey and related surveys.\n(Abbr: Taxonomy means the main taxonomy used in the\nsurvey.

The motiva-\ntion behind deep learning and transformers lies in their ability to\nautomatically learn comprehensive representations from raw data,\nthus capturing complex nonlinear relationships and temporal de-\npendencies without the need for manual feature engineering. Such\ncapability leads to significant performance improvements compared\nwith traditional statistical methods across numerous time series ap-\nplications. Foundation models (FMs), such as large language models\n(LLMs) in natural language processing (NLP) [117] and advanced\nmodels in computer vision (CV) [ 2], have emerged as powerful\nparadigms capable of achieving state-of-the-art performances in\ntheir respective fields. The success of these FMs can be attributed\nto their ability to leverage vast amounts of data to cultivate general-\npurpose representations , subsequently fine-tuning them, or even\ndeploying them directly in a zero-shot manner to excel across a\ndiverse spectrum of downstream tasks. This approach not only\neconomizes on the need for task-specific model development but\nalso encapsulates a broad understanding of the world, endowing\nthese models with exceptional versatility and efficiency [6, 49].\nInspired by the remarkable achievements of FMs in broad do-\nmains like CV and NLP, the concept of Time Series Foundation\nModels (TSFMs) has garnered attention as a promising direction\nfor time series analysis. TSFMs aim to harness the power of the\nfoundation model paradigm to develop generalized models profi-\ncient in understanding and forecasting time series data spanning\ndiverse domains. By capitalizing on large-scale time series datasets,\nTSFMs hold the promise of attaining superior performance on a\nspectrum of time series tasks, offering a unified framework that\ncan accelerate research and application developments in this field.\nDespite the promising prospects and rapid development of TSFMs,\na systematic analysis of TSFMs from a methodological standpoint\nhas been notably absent in prior literature. Existing studies, as de-\npicted in Table 1, have concentrated on either the data perspective\n[48] or the pipeline perspective [45] of TSFMs. To bridge this gap,\nthis survey aims to provide a comprehensive methodological anal-\nysis of foundation models for learning a variety of time series. This\nexamination will center on scrutinizing their model architectures ,\npre-training techniques , adaptation methods , and data modalities .\nThrough this endeavor, we seek to illuminate an overall picture of\ncore elements in TSFMs, thereby enhancing comprehension regard-\ning the rationale behind their efficacy and the mechanisms driving\ntheir substantial potential in time series analysis.\nIn contrast to previous surveys, this manuscript incorporates\nthe most extensive array of time series data types (see Table 1),\nspatial time series, as well as other types such as the trajectory\nand event. We further summarize the developmental roadmap of\ncurrent TSFMs in Figure 1, in order to foster further innovations\nand understanding in the dynamic and ever-evolving landscape of\nTSFMs. In short, our major contributions lie in three aspects:\n•Comprehensive and up-to-date survey. We offer a compre-\nhensive and up-to-date survey on foundation models for a wide\nspectrum of time series, encompassing standard time series, spa-\ntial time series, and other types (i.e., trajectories and events).\n•Novel methodology-centric taxonomy. We introduce a novel\ntaxonomy that offers a thorough analysis from a methodological\nstandpoint on TSFMs with the first shot, enabling a full under-\nstanding of the mechanism on why and how FMs can achieve\nadmirable performance in time series data.\n•Future research oppotunities. We discuss and highlight future\navenues for enhancing time series analysis using foundation\nmodels, urging researchers to delve deeper into this area.\n2 BACKGROUND\nFoundation Models. Foundation models (FMs), also known as\nlarge pre-trained models, are a class of deep models that are pre-\ntrained on vast amounts of data, thus equipped with a wide range of\ngeneral knowledge and patterns. To this end, these models serve as\na versatile starting point for various tasks across different domains.\nSpecifically, FMs can be fine-tuned or adapted to specific tasks with\nrelatively small amounts of task-specific data, showcasing remark-\nable flexibility and efficiency. In CV, FMs such as text-prompted\nmodel CLIP [73] and visual-prompted model SAM [51] have pro-\npelled advancements in image recognition, object detection, and\nmore. In NLP, FMs such as BERT [25] and GPT-3 [8] have revolu-\ntionized text understanding and generation tasks. Inspired by the\ngreat success of FMs in the above domains, this survey delves into\nthe utilization of these models in the realm of time series analysis.\nConcretely, we investigate TSFMs from a methodology perspec-\ntive: the components of foundation models encompass the data\nmodality, architecture, pre-training, and adaptation technicals: 1)\ndata modality refers to the type of data used for model training,\nfrom single modality such as time series, text, images, and audio\nto multimodality; 2) architecture refers to which deep neural net-\nwork is adopted as the backbone of FM, with Transformers [85, 95]\nbeing a popular choice for their ability to handle sequential data\neffectively; 3) Pre-training involves how to train the model on\nlarge, diverse datasets to gain a broad understanding of the data,\nusing supervised or self-supervised learning; 4) Adaptation, such as\nfine-tuning or few-shot learning, is employed to accommodate the\npre-trained FMs to specific tasks. This comprehensive framework\nof FMs, spanning from data modality to adaptation, facilitates the\nunderstanding of using them in time series analysis.\nCategories of Time Series. A time series is commonly described\nas an ordered sequence of data points. Figure 2 illustrates various\ntypes of time series discussed in this survey, including standard\ntime series, spatial time series, trajectories, and events. Note that\ntrajectories and events can be regarded as time series since each\ndata point is associated with a specific timestamp (and location),\nallowing for analysis using time series techniques such as anomaly\ndetection. These time series are formulated as follows.\nFoundation Models for Time Series Analysis: A Tutorial and Survey KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain\nTrajectory\nStandard Time SeriesTimeSpatial Time SeriesSpatial\nSpatial\nTime\nTimeEvent\nTime\n……\nOther Time Series\nFigure 2: Illustration of various types of time series.\nDefinition 1 (Standard Time Series). The standard time series is\ndefined as a sequence of 𝑇 data points ordered by time. It can be\ndenoted by X = {x1,x2,··· ,x𝑇}∈ R𝑇×𝐷, where x𝑡 ∈R𝐷 is the\ndata point at time step𝑡, and 𝐷is the dimension of each data points.\nWhen 𝐷 = 1, X is referred to as a univariate time series, while\n𝐷 > 1, X is a multivariate time series.\nDefinition 2 (Spatial Time Series). It refers to a sequence of data\npoints with both temporal and spatial dimensions, which can be rep-\nresented by X= {X1,X2,··· ,X𝑇}∈ R𝑁×𝑇×𝐷, where X𝑡 ∈R𝑁×𝐷\ndenotes the signals generated by 𝑁 sensors with each equipped\nwith 𝐷 features. Besides, the 𝑁 sensors are usually associated with\nspatial correlations, according to which the spatial time series can be\nfurther divided into two subtypes: i) spatio-temporal graph, when\nthe spatial correlation of those sensors is described by a graph 𝐺\nwith adjacent matrix A ∈R𝑁×𝑁; ii) spatio-temporal raster, when\nsensors are distributed uniformly as a grid in geographical space.\nDefinition 3 (Trajectory). A trajectory is a sequence of times-\ntamped locations that describe the movements of an object in the\ngeographical space. It can be formulated as T= {(𝑙1,𝑙2,··· ,𝑙𝑇}∈\nR𝑇×2, where 𝑙𝑡 means the object’s location at time 𝑡, represented\nby the two-dimensional coordinates, i.e., latitude and longitude.\nDefinition 4 (Event Sequence). An event sequence is a tempo-\nrally ordered set of events that describe the progression of actions\nor occurrences within a specific context. It can be formalized as\nE= {(𝑒1,𝑡1),(𝑒2,𝑡2),..., (𝑒𝑛,𝑡𝑛)}, where 𝑒𝑖 is an event described\nby a predicate-argument structure that captures the nature of the\noccurrence, and 𝑡𝑖 denotes the timestamp when 𝑒𝑖 occurs.\n3 TAXONOMY\nThe proposed taxonomy is illustrated in Figure 3, and the related\nworks can be found in Table 2. The proposed taxonomy unfolds\na structured and comprehensive classification to enhance the un-\nderstanding of foundation models on time series analysis. It is\norganized into four hierarchical levels, starting with the data cate-\ngory, followed by the model architecture, pre-training techniques,\nand finally, the application domain. Unlike previous taxonomies,\nours distinguishes itself by delving deeper into the foundation mod-\nels from the methodology perspective, with a keen focus on their\narchitectural designs, pre-training, and adaptation techniques. This\nmethod-centric view is pivotal for researchers, providing valuable\ninsights into the mechanisms of why and how foundation models\nshow great potential for time series analysis.\nDiving into the details of data categories, we classify the time\nseries data into three distinct types: standard time series, spatial\ntime series, and others, which encompass trajectory and event data.\nStandard time series data, characterized by their sequential order\nand temporal dependencies, form the backbone of traditional time\nseries analysis. Spatial time series data, on the other hand, introduce\nan additional layer of complexity by incorporating geographical\nor spatial information, making them crucial for applications in\nurban computing and environmental monitoring. Lastly, the “others”\ncategory, including trajectory and event data, represents diverse\ndatasets where time plays a critical role, such as the movement of\nobjects over time or the occurrence of specific events, offering a\nbroadened perspective on time series analysis.\nFrom the methodology perspective: i) regarding model architec-\nture, the proposed taxonomy highlights three primary categories:\nTransformer-based, non-Transformer-based, and diffusion-based\nmodels. Transformer-based models leverage self-attention mecha-\nnisms to capture long-range dependencies within time series, of-\nfering significant advantages in handling sequential data. Non-\ntransformer-based models, with their diverse architectures, cater\nto a wide range of time series tasks by efficiently processing tem-\nporal patterns. Diffusion-based models, a novel addition, employ\nstochastic processes to model the data generation process, present-\ning innovative solutions for time series analysis. ii) In terms of\npre-training techniques, the proposed taxonomy divides them into\nfully-supervised and self-supervised methods, the latter of which\nincludes contrastive, generative, and hybrid approaches. This clas-\nsification shows how different FMs are trained with or without\nlabels. iii) Adaptation strategies, such as zero-shot learning, prompt\nengineering, tokenization, and fine-tuning, further exemplify the\nversatility of FMs in customizing to specific time series applications.\n4 DATA PERSPECTIVE\nIn this section, we explore advancements in TSFMs from various\ndata perspectives: standard time series , spatial time series , and others.\nWe further categorize our discussion within each subsection into\ntask-oriented or general-purpose foundation models.\n4.1 Standard Time Series\nStandard time series possess diverse properties, including varying\nsampling rates and temporal patterns, which pose significant chal-\nlenges in developing relevant FMs. These models aim to identify\nuniversal patterns within extensive time series data from varied\nsources, either to enhance specific tasks or for broad analysis.\nMost of the existing attempts are in the category of task-oriented\nstandard time series foundation models. They leverage single or\nmultiple data modalities to craft robust models targeting particular\ntime series tasks, typically forecasting or classification. For models\ninvolved only in a single (i.e., time series) modality, they may either\nbe developed from scratch or on existing pre-trained models from\nother domains like large language or vision models [117].\nIn the first group, Lag-Llama [75] and TimeGPT-1 [35] represent\npioneering efforts as forecasting foundation models. Both models\nundergo pre-training on a vast collection of time series data span-\nning multiple domains. Lag-Llama employs a decoder-only trans-\nformer architecture, utilizing lags as covariates, whereas TimeGPT-\n1 features an encoder-decoder structure with several transformer\nlayers, facilitating efficient zero-shot forecasting. Another note-\nworthy contribution is TTMs [31], a recent endeavor in creating a\ndomain-agnostic forecasting model built upon TSMixer [30], which\nitself is pre-trained on diverse time series datasets from various\nKDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain Yuxuan Liang et al.\nFoundation Modelsfor Time Series\nStandard Time Series\nTransformer-based\nPre-trainedLLM, AM, VLM\nGeneral: Time-LLM [47], OFA [120], LLM4TS [11], PromptCast [102],TEMPO [10], LLMTime [36], Voice2Series [105], AutoTimes [63], UniTime [60]\nFinance: Yuet al.[108], Chenet al.[19], Xieet al.[100], Wimmeret al.[96]\nHealthcare: Liuet al.[62]\nSelf-supervised\nGenerative General:PatchTST [68], Moirai [97], Lag-Llama [75],TimeSiam [26], Timer [64], Daset al.[24], UniTS [34],TimeGPT-1 [35], Chronos [1], MTSMAE [84]\nContrastive General:TEST [83], TimeCLR [107]\nHealthcare:METS [52]\nHybrid General:SimMTM [27]\nFully-supervisedGeneral: TimeXer [90], UniTS [34]\nnon-Transformer-based(MLP RNN CNN)\nSelf-supervisedGenerative General:TSMixer [30]\nContrastive General:TF-C [115] , TS2Vec [111] , CLUDA [69]\nFully-supervisedGeneral: TTMs [31], TimesNet [98], RWKV-TS [40]\nDiffusion-based\nGeneral:TimeGrad [76] , D3VAE [55] , TransFusion [82] , ScoreGrad [104] ,Bilošet al.[5] , Crabbéet al.[23] , TimeDiff [80] , Wanget al.[89] , DiffTime [22]\nFinance:FTS-Diffusion [42]\nPower:DiffLoad [92]\nSpatial Time Series\nTransformer-based\nPre-trained LLMTransportation:ST-LLM [58], TPLLM [77]\nGeneral:GATGPT [18]\nSelf-supervisedGenerative\nTransportation:STEP [79]\nClimate:W-MAE [65], MetePFL [14], FengWu [13]\nGeneral:UniST [109]\nFully-supervisedTransportation:CPPBTR [29] , TFM [88]\nClimate:FourCastNet [70] , FedWing [15] , Pangu-Weather [3], ClimaX [67]\nnon-Transformer-based(MLP RNN CNN) Self-supervisedGeneral:SPGCL [53] , STGCL [61]\nDiffusion-based General:DiffSTG [93] , DSTPP [110] , DYffusion [9] , Yunet al.[112] , USTD [41] , PriSTI [59]\nOthers\nTransformer-based\nPre-trained LLMMobility:AuxMobLCast [103] , LLM-Mob [87]\nEvent:LAMP [81] , Gunjal & Durrettet al.[38]\nSelf-supervised\nGenerative Mobility:GTM [56]\nEvent:NYUTron [44] , GatorTron [106]\nContrastive Mobility:TrajCL [12]\nnon-Transformer-based(MLP RNN CNN) Self-supervised\nGenerative Mobility:Trembr [33]\nContrastive Mobility:MMTEC [57]\nHybrid Mobility:START [43]\nDiffusion-based Mobility:TrajGDM [21] , DiffTraj [122]\nFigure 3: A comprehensive taxonomy of TSFMs, categorized according to data and methodologies.\ndomains. Echoing Lag-Llama’s approach, TimesFM [24] emerges\nas a decoder-only model exhibiting strong zero-shot forecasting\ncapabilities. Concurrently, Moirai [97] introduces an approach with\nits masked encoder-based universal forecasting transformer, cou-\npled with a new pre-training dataset (LOTSA), containing 27 bil-\nlion observations from nine distinct domains. Additionally, the\nexploration extends to diffusion models like TimeGrad [ 76] and\nTransFusion [82], which primarily focus on optimizing a variational\nbound on data likelihood, transforming white noise into meaningful\nsamples of the target distribution.\nPre-training from scratch can be expensive, which has spurred\nthe development of alternative approaches that leverage pre-trained\nmodels from other domains, such as large language, vision, and\nacoustic models. For instance, LLM4TS [11] and TEMPO [10] suc-\ncessfully perform time series forecasting across various datasets by\nfine-tuning GPT-2 [74] backbones, predicated on the notion that\nLLMs can be adapted to process non-linguistic datasets by activat-\ning their inherent capabilities. Similarly, Voice2Series [105] engages\nin the synchronization of time series and acoustic data to harness\nthe classification prowess of an acoustic model for time series data.\nFoundation Models for Time Series Analysis: A Tutorial and Survey KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain\nAnother approach is presented by Wimmer et al. [96], who utilize\nvision-language models (VLMs) to predict market changes. Beyond\nfine-tuning existing models, a distinct methodology involves di-\nrect inference from LLMs for time series forecasting, showcasing\ncommendable zero-shot performance. A notable example of this\nis LLMTime [ 36], which introduces various strategies for effec-\ntively tokenizing time series data and transforming discrete token\ndistributions into flexible continuous value densities.\nBeyond approaches that focus solely on a single data modal-\nity of time series, there have been initiatives towards developing\nmulti-modal, task-oriented foundation models. A notable example\nis Time-LLM [47], which introduces a reprogramming framework\nto integrate textual and time series information, repurposing an\nexisting LLM into time series forecasters without additional compu-\ntational costs. In a similar vein, METS [52] employs a trainable ECG\nencoder alongside a frozen language model to process paired ECG\nand clinical reports. Further, there is emerging research on directly\nprompting LLMs for specific time series tasks. For instance, Prompt-\nCast [102] converts numerical inputs and outputs into prompts,\nframing the forecasting task as a sentence-to-sentence conversion\nto leverage language models directly for forecasting. Other studies,\nsuch as one involving LLMs prompted with historical stock price\ndata, company metadata, and past economic/financial news, aim to\nenhance stock return forecasting [108]. Another example combines\nGNNs with ChatGPT to predict stock movements [ 19], illustrat-\ning the diverse applications of these methodologies. Additional\nnoteworthy efforts include [100] and [62].\nNotably, recent efforts have been moved towards creating general-\npurpose, single-modality standard TSFMs. TS2Vec [111] is a pio-\nneering effort by introducing a universal framework for represent-\ning time series via contrastive learning. SimMTM [ 27] explores\ncross-domain applications, where pre-trained models via masked\ntime series modeling exhibit superior fine-tuning performance in\nforecasting and classification tasks. More recent works, such as\nTimer [64] and UniTS [34], further advance the field by facilitat-\ning general time series analysis through single, large-scale pre-\ntrained models. Moreover, there is a growing interest in adapting\npre-trained models, such as LLMs, for broad time series analysis.\nOFA [120] and TEST [ 83] exemplify this trend, though both ap-\nproaches necessitate end-to-end fine-tuning for specific tasks.\n4.2 Spatial Time Series\nIn complex real-world systems, time series data often display intri-\ncate spatial dependencies alongside temporal dynamics, manifest-\ning in forms such as spatio-temporal graphs and rasters. Similar to\nthe discussion in Sec. 4.1, research on spatial time series typically\nencompasses areas such as forecasting and classification. Unlike\nfoundation models for standard time series, most existing research\non spatial time series is still in its early stages, often characterized\nby being domain-specific, single-modality, and task-oriented. In\nthe following, we categorize related works into two specific data\nmodalities and discuss them in different subsections.\n4.2.1 Spatio-Temporal Graph. Most foundation models for spatio-\ntemporal graphs are task-oriented and only focused on graph data.\nIn the transportation sector, TFM [ 88] utilizes graph structures\nand algorithms to analyze the behavior and interactions within\ntransportation systems, showing promising results in urban traffic\nforecasting. ST-LLM [58] combines spatio-temporal information\nwith a partially frozen LLM to improve traffic predictions, while\nDiffSTG [93] applies denoising diffusion models to spatio-temporal\ngraphs for probabilistic traffic forecasting. Efforts towards domain-\nagnostic models include STEP [ 79], which links spatio-temporal\nGNNs with a pre-trained transformer for enhanced forecasting by\nlearning from extensive historical data. Similarly, STGCL [61] and\nSPGCL [53] explore the integration of contrastive learning into\nspatio-temporal graph forecasting, indicating its potential benefits.\nResearch on general-purpose models for spatio-temporal graphs is\nlimited. A notable example, USTD [41], introduces a unified model\nfor both forecasting and kriging tasks, employing an uncertainty-\naware diffusion approach to address diverse challenges effectively.\n4.2.2 Spatio-Temporal Raster. Spatio-temporal raster refers to a\ndata modality that captures and organizes spatial information over\nvarious time points in a grid-like format. This modality is primar-\nily utilized in climate foundation models. For instance, FourCast-\nNet [70] is a global, data-driven weather forecasting model deliver-\ning accurate short to medium-range predictions worldwide. Similar\nmodels, such as FengWu [ 13] and W-MAE [65], follow suit. No-\ntably, Pangu-Weather [4], which is trained on 39 years of global data,\nachieves superior deterministic forecasting outcomes across all eval-\nuated variables compared to leading numerical weather prediction\nsystems. On a different note, ClimaX [67] aims at general-purpose\nclimate foundation models, pre-trained with diverse datasets cover-\ning various variables, spatio-temporal scopes, and physical contexts.\nIt is designed for fine-tuning across a wide array of climate and\nweather-related tasks, such as forecasting, projection, and down-\nscaling, even for atmospheric variables and spatio-temporal scales\nnot encountered during its pre-training phase. However, there is\na scarce number of domain-agnostic models for spatio-temporal\nraster data. DYffusion [9], for example, capitalizes on the tempo-\nral dynamics inherent in raster data, integrating these dynamics\ndirectly with the model’s diffusion steps to create a stochastic, time-\nconditioned interpolator and forecasting network.\n4.3 Others\nIn addition to standard and spatial time series, various other types\nof data incorporate the temporal dimension, including trajecto-\nries, events, and clinical records. A majority of studies in this cat-\negory focus on trajectory data. For Transformer-based models,\nAuxMobLCast [103] fine-tunes pre-trained LLMs through mobility\nprompting and auxiliary POI Category classification to forecast hu-\nman mobility patterns, effectively bridging the gap between natural\nlanguage processing and temporal sequence prediction. LLM-Mob\n[87] encodes human mobility data into structured prompts that in-\nstruct LLMs to consider both long-term and short-term behavioral\npatterns, along with time-specific context, to generate accurate and\nexplainable predictions of future locations. For non-Transformer-\nbased models, Trembr [33] leverages auto-encoding techniques to\nextract road network and temporal information embedded in trajec-\ntories effectively. While START [43] introduces a hybrid approach\nto trajectory embedding learning by combining masked language\nmodel [25] and SimCLR [ 17] to enhance its learning capability.\nMore recently, GTM [56] separates trajectory features into three\nKDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain Yuxuan Liang et al.\n(a) Transformer-based(b) Non-Transformer-based(c) Diffusion-based\nFigure 4: Architectures of TSFMs.\ndomains, which can be masked and generated independently to\nmeet specific input and output requirements of a given task. Then,\nGTM is pre-trained by reconstructing densely sampled trajectories\nin an auto-regressive manner given re-sampled sparse counter-\nparts. For the diffusion-based model, DiffTraj [ 122] reconstructs\nand synthesizes geographic trajectories from white noise through\na conditioned reverse trajectory denoising process.\n5 METHODOLOGY PERSPECTIVE\nIn this section, we dissect TSFMs from a methodology perspective,\nfocusing on architecture and pipeline (including pre-train and adap-\ntation) intricacies. This discussion aims to elucidate the intricate\nmechanisms driving these models’ efficacy and adaptability.\n5.1 Architecture\nAs shown in Figure 4, we first delve into the architecture of TSFMs,\nincluding Transformer-based models , non-Transformer-based nodels\nand diffusion-based models, focusing on the underlying mechanisms\nthat shape their capabilities, as well as how they could be applied\non various time series.\n5.1.1 Transformer-based Models. The architecture of FMs has seen\na significant convergence towards the Transformer [85], a model\narchitecture first introduced for NLP tasks. The core innovation of\nthe Transformer lies in its utilization of the attention mechanism,\nwhich allows the model to dynamically focus on different parts of\nthe input data. The attention function can be succinctly described\nas Attention(𝑄,𝐾,𝑉 )= Softmax(𝑄𝐾𝑇/\n√︁\n𝑑𝑘)𝑉, where 𝑄, 𝐾, and\n𝑉 represent the queries, keys, and values matrices respectively,\neach with dimensions 𝑇 ×𝑑𝑘, and 𝑑𝑘 serves as a scaling factor\nto moderate the dot products’ magnitude. It is evident from the\nformula that the attention mechanism has the capability to learn\nglobal, long-range dependencies in data. This distinguishes it from\nprevious architectures, which were often limited by their local\nreceptive fields or dependency windows. Besides, the Transformer’s\ndesign is inherently friendly to parallelization, which allows for\nsignificant scalability, enabling the processing of large datasets\nand the construction of models with billions of parameters. Such\nscalability and efficiency in capturing intricate data patterns have\nled to the widespread adoption of the Transformer architecture\nbeyond its initial application in natural language processing (NLP)\n[25] to fields including computer vision (CV), speech, video, time\nseries (Table 2) and beyond.\nThe choice of foundation model framework remains debated\nin the realm of time series analysis, contrasting the trend towards\ndecoder-only models in natural language processing. Notable works\nin this area includes encoder-only [ 34, 68, 97], encoder-decoder\n[1, 26, 35], and decoder-only [24, 64, 75] models. Ansari et al. [1]\nanalyze the applicability of the encoder-decoder framework to\ndecoder-only models. Liu et al. [64] discuss that while the encoder-\nonly model is favored in time series forecasting for its effectiveness\non small datasets, the decoder-only architecture, with its strong\ngeneralization and capacity, could be preferred for large-scale time\nseries models. The diversity in the architectural choices underscores\nthe potential and necessity for further exploration within this field.\nIn terms of standard time series analysis, the Transformer archi-\ntecture leverages its sequence modeling capabilities to capture tem-\nporal dynamics. This includes either repurposing pretrained LLMs\nfor time series to leverage their preexisting sequence modeling\nstrengths [102], or directly using Transformer as a base for TSFMs,\ntraining from scratch to achieve models best suited for the specifics\nof time series data [35]. Besides, various techniques have been inno-\nvated to augment the functionality of Transformer models in time\nseries analysis comprehensively. A common practice in TSFMs seg-\nments time series into patches, which can effectively encapsulate\nlocal dynamics within input tokens [10, 11, 20, 24, 47, 68, 75, 97, 120].\nAnother critical design is the normalization layer, where reversible\ninstance normalization [50] techniques, standardizing data through\ninstance-specific mean and variance then reverting it at the output\nlayer, have found extensive application across the above models.\nMoreover, specialized approaches such as multi-resolution analy-\nsis, exemplified by Moirai [97] through the employment of vary-\ning patch sizes, and decomposition strategies, as implemented by\nTEMPO [10] via the separation of complex interactions into the\ntrend, seasonal, and residual components, have been shown to\nenhance model efficacy substantially.\nFor spatial time series, the attention mechanism is utilized to\nmodel both the spatial and temporal dependency. For instance, ST-\nLLM [58] employs a novel partially frozen attention strategy for\ntraffic prediction, leveraging spatial-temporal embeddings to cap-\nture the intricate dynamics of traffic data across space and time.\nConversely, other studies opt for independent modeling of spa-\ntial and temporal relationships. TFM [88] is a case in point, which\nemploys attention mechanisms within a dynamic graph encoder\nfor spatial modeling, integrating time encoding for temporal as-\npects, embodying principles of transformers in addressing traffic\nsystem’s spatial-temporal dependencies. Besides simultaneously\nmodeling spatial and temporal relationships, there exists an alterna-\ntive approach that augments the Transformer model with additional\nspatial models or external spatial information to enhance its capa-\nbilities in the temporal modeling of time series. An example of this\nis STEP [79], which uses unsupervised pre-trained TransFormer\nblocks to model temporal relationship from long-term history time\nseries, while applying a graph structure learner and spatio-temporal\nGNNs based on the representation of TransFormer blocks. Further-\nmore, the application of Transformer models extends to the domain\nof spatial-temporal prompt learning, as evidenced by initiatives\nsuch as MetePFL [14] and FedWing [15].\nIn addition to conventional time series data, the Transformer\narchitecture has demonstrated efficacy across a diverse array of\ntemporal datasets, such as trajectory and healthcare records, as sum-\nmarized in Figure 3. This expansion highlights the Transformer’s\nversatile capacity for temporal data analysis.\nFoundation Models for Time Series Analysis: A Tutorial and Survey KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain\n5.1.2 Non-Transformer-based Models. Excluding the widespread\nadoption of Transformers, a diverse array of traditional pre-training\nmethods leveraged models such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs)\n[31], Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) [33], and Convolutional\nNeural Networks (CNNs) [ 98] as the backbone for pre-training.\nThese models, each with their unique strengths, are notable for\ntheir effectiveness in both conventional and spatial time series data.\nMLPs and CNNs are both acclaimed for their capabilities in\nmodeling spatial and temporal data effectively. CNN-based archi-\ntectures, in particular, have garnered significant attention in self-\nsupervised learning for general time series representation, with\na notable emphasis on the usage of ResNet [ 27, 115] and dilated\nconvolution layers [69, 111] as foundational backbones. Those ap-\nproaches predominantly employ 1D convolutional operations. In\ncontrast, TimesNet [98] introduces a novel perspective by convert-\ning 1D time series data into 2D tensors, facilitating the adaptive\nidentification of multi-periodicity and the extraction of complex\ntemporal variations through the use of a parameter-efficient incep-\ntion block. MLP-based models, on the other hand, are lauded for\ntheir lightweight design, offering benefits in terms of reduced com-\nputational time and cost. TSMixer [30] and TTMs [31], as instances,\nboth claiming superior efficiency in memory usage and processing\nspeed while still delivering competitive performance.\nRNNs have been acknowledged for their proficiency in temporal\ndata modeling [33, 39]. Recently, there has been a resurgence of\ninterest in RNN architectures, which poses a compelling challenge\nto the prevailing Transformer-based models. This trend is driven\nby the quest for models that are not only more resource-efficient\nbut also adept at handling longer sequences through their inherent\nlinear complexity. A notable embodiment is the RWKV-TS [ 40],\nwhich leverages the RWKV [72], an RNN-type foundation model\narchitecture, demonstrating promising potential for general time\nseries analysis. This emerging trend presents a valuable opportunity\nfor time series research and applications.\n5.1.3 Diffusion-based Models. Diffusion-based foundation mod-\nels have gained prominence in CV [ 71, 78] and video [ 7] due to\ntheir proficiency in learning complex data distributions, yet their\nexploration in time series analysis remains nascent. These models\nfunction by gradually introducing and then reversing noise to data,\neffectively learning the generative process of original data through\nthe reverse diffusion process. This unique mechanism equips diffu-\nsion models with great potential to serve as versatile foundation\nmodels capable of tackling prediction, imputation, and anomaly\ndetection in time series.\nIn standard time series and other temporal data, diffusion models\npredict future states by capturing temporal dynamics, generating\nsmooth transitions from current to potential future states [76, 92].\nApplied to spatial time series, they extend this capability to model\nspatial correlations alongside temporal ones, providing insights\ninto the interplay between space and time, particularly beneficial\nin fields like traffic forecasting [93].\n5.2 Pipeline\nIn this part, we review TSFMs from the pipeline perspective, in-\ncluding diverse model acquisition and adaptation mechanisms.\n5.2.1 Pre-training. Pre-training is an initial and crucial step for\nbuilding TSFMs, since the knowledge learned in this phase enables\nthe models to generalize across different contexts and quickly adapt\nto various downstream tasks with minimal adaptations. On the\nother hand, the diverse nature of pre-training data (e.g., standard\ntime series, spatial time series, and trajectories), as well as the way\nthe data is used, lead to a wide spectrum of pre-training mechanisms\nwhen building and deploying foundation model. In this survey, we\npropose a new perspective mostly based on learning objectives in\nthe pre-training phase, to categorize existing methods for TSFMs.\nThese mechanisms include fully-supervised, self-supervised (gener-\native, contrastive, hybrid of generative and contrastive), and others.\nFully-supervised pre-training refers to the strategy where the\nfoundation model is initially trained on one or multiple large time se-\nries datasets with labels to capture the complex temporal dynamics\nand learn generalizable representations. TTMs [31] proposes a uni-\nversal time series foundation model supervised framework that is\nable to handle the heterogeneity of multiple time series datasets and\neffectively build the forecasting capability during pre-training, via\nthe design of multi-resolution enhancements (e.g., adaptive patch-\ning, data augmentation via downsampling, etc.) Fully-supervised\npre-training for TSFMs is particularly suited for scenarios where\nthere is sufficient labeled historical data. Moreover, this pre-training\ntechnique is more frequently used in some domain-specific applica-\ntions such as transportation [29, 88] and climate [3, 70], where the\nmodel can be directly tailored for downstream forecasting tasks\nwith the ease of minimal adaptations.\nWe categorize the generative pre-training strategy as a general\nmodeling of time series representations, including reconstruction\nand probabilistic modeling of time series inputs. In reconstruction-\nbased pre-training, an effective learning objective is to recover the\noriginal input space via masked autoencoding strategies [14, 79]. In\nthe probabilistic modeling methods, the latent representation space\nformed from temporal or spatial-temporal encoders is optimized to-\nward an estimated density via maximizing log-likelihood, based on\nwhich the forecasts can be sampled [76, 93]. Moreover, it is also ben-\neficial to leverage contrastive learning to enhance the robustness of\npre-training time series foundation models. The key is to construct\nand utilize the self-supervision signals by generating informative\npositive pairs as well as filtering out unsuitable negative pairs when\nperforming augmentation [61]. In addition to the aforementioned\ntwo self-supervised strategies, the efficacy of the hybrid variant\nhas also been validated, where the pre-trained model on fewer time\nseries data outperforms the supervised counterpart [43].\nIn general, self-supervised pre-training enables foundation mod-\nels to exploit the vast amounts of unlabeled time series data, pro-\nviding generic temporal knowledge that can be further fine-tuned\nfor specific downstream tasks. Compared with fully-supervised\npre-training, it provides a more generic and realistic solution for\nthe acquisition of a time series foundation model.\nNote that the above pre-training methods typically build the\nmodel from scratch and obtain the universal knowledge from data\nwith the same modality (i.e., time series). Nevertheless, recent ad-\nvancements in time series research have heightened the usage of\nLLMs [10, 11, 19, 36, 38, 47, 58, 62, 63, 81, 87, 100, 102, 103, 108, 120],\nVLMs [96], and AMs [ 105] that are pre-trained from other data\nmodalities (text sequence, image-text sequence, acoustic signals).\nKDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain Yuxuan Liang et al.\n5.2.2 Adaptation. The adaptation phase tailors TSFM to specific\ntasks or datasets, enhancing its performance on those tasks by lever-\naging the learned generic temporal knowledge. We partition prior\nmethods into four branches, including direct usage, fine-tuning,\nprompt engineering, and time series tokenization (see Figure 5).\n(a)Directusage(b)Tuning-based(c)Prompting-based(d)Tokenization-based\nTSFM\ninference\nForecastImputeDetect\nTSFM\ninference\nForecastImputeDetect\nFine-tune\n LLM\nForecastImputeDetect\nPromptEngineering\nInstruction\nTSFM/LLM\nForecastImputeDetect\nPrompting\nInstruction\nToken.\nFigure 5: Illustration of different adaptation techniques.\nDirect usage (also called zero-shot), means no further fine-tuning\non the target datasets, suggesting the sufficient capability of a\npre-trained model for downstream tasks. It can also indicate the\nhomogeneity between the pre-trained dataset and target dataset,\nespecially for some real-world applications where a foundation\nmodel is built to fulfill domain-specific tasks [4, 13].\nFine-tuning is a common strategy to adapt foundation models to\ntarget tasks. Based on the way the foundation model is used on the\ntarget dataset, there are three mainstream works: fine-tuning the\nwhole model [65, 67, 70] or specific components (e.g., training posi-\ntional embeddings and layer normalization, while keeping feedfor-\nward and attention layers frozen when fine-tuning LLMs) [11, 120],\nto directly infer results, or integrate foundation models as part of\nthe whole model [19, 52, 83, 103].\nPrompt engineering is more specialized in LLM-based TSFMs.\nThe prompt can be handcrafted with task-specific textual input and\ndirectly used to query the output for downstream prediction [87,\n102] or intermediate embedding as feature enhancement [103]. Be-\nsides, the prompt can also be parameterized vectors and end-to-end\nlearnable when optimizing the model on target datasets [10, 83]. In\ncomparison to static prompts, the use of trainable prompts enhances\nthe ability of LLMs to comprehend and match the context of given\ntime series inputs. For example, TEMPO [10] constructs a trainable\nprompt pool with distinct key-value pairs, and retrieves the most\nrepresentative prompt candidates with the highest similarity scores.\nTime series tokenization aims to effectively represent the time\nseries as embeddings, which is also more frequently adopted in\ntransformer-based architectures [ 10, 47, 68]. Common tokeniza-\ntion techniques include reversible instance normalization [50] that\nmitigates distribution shift, patching with channel independence\nstrategy that effectively and efficiently extracts the time series con-\ntext [68], as well as the joint usage of time series decomposition\nto explicitly represent explainable components [10] for the ease of\nsubsequent temporal modeling.\nIn addition to the main branches of adapting TSFMs, it is also\nworth noting that some fine-tuning strategies take real-world con-\nstraints into account. For example, the fine-tuning is performed in\na privacy-preserved manner [14, 16].\n5.3 Modality\nDuring the pre-training/adaptation of TSFMs, prior methods in-\nvolve single or multiple data modalities, where standard time series,\ntrajectory, raster, and text can be treated as different forms with\nunique domain perspectives. In this part, we review the data modal-\nities that are used in existing TSFMs across different domains.\n5.3.1 Single-modality. A majority of current TSFMs are constructed\nand tailored on the basis of single-modal data. Compared with\nmulti-modal methods, the single-modal time series modeling strat-\negy gains the advantages of inherent simplicity and bypasses the\nchallenges of handling modality gaps, yet frequently demonstrates\nexcellent empirical results across a wide range of real-world appli-\ncations, such as traffic [58, 79] and climate forecasting [13, 67].\n5.3.2 Multi-modality. However, the single-modal methods may\nnot encapsulate the full picture for several challenging downstream\ntasks in finance [19, 108] and healthcare domains [52, 62]. To cope\nwith this issue, there have been initiatives towards developing multi-\nmodal, task-oriented FMs, where additional information provides\nuseful information to enhance the model capability. In Chen et al. ,\nan external ChatGPT is queried to construct an evolving graph\nstructure representing companies, based on the analysis of news\nheadlines at specific time steps. As such, the inferred graph and\nstock prices are fed into the time series model (that uses GNN and\nLSTM for information propagation) to generate stock price move-\nment predictions. Another example in healthcare also demonstrated\nthe effectiveness of multi-modal medical context modeling, which\naligns the embedding of ECG (Electrocardiogram) and correspond-\ning medical text reports under a self-supervised contrastive learning\nframework and performs ECG classification. In general multi-modal\ntime series analysis, similar cross-modality alignment strategies\n(e.g., contrastive learning [ 83], reprogramming [ 47], token-wise\nprompting [63]) are adopted, where the multi-modal inputs are of-\nten the textual description of datasets and pre-training word embed-\nding from LLMs. As a notable example, Time-LLM [47] introduces\na reprogramming framework that aligns the language knowledge\nfrom pre-trained word embedding and time series information via\nlinear projection and multi-head attention, where the handcrafted\ndataset descriptions are also used to quired text token embeddings\nas prompts, which further enhances the embedding space and in-\nforms the LLM to comprehend the task contexts. As such, utilizing\nmulti-modal data facilitates the repurpose of the existing LLM into\ntime series forecasters without additional computational costs.\n6 CONCLUSION\nThe rapid development of FMs has revolutionized the research fields\nin different domains. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive\nand updated review of FMs specifically designed for time series anal-\nysis. A novel taxonomy is proposed from a methodology-centric\nperspective by classifying FMs based on key components including\nmodel architecture, pre-training technique, adaptation technique,\nand data modality. Our survey facilitates understanding the under-\nlying mechanism of applying the FMs to time series. Furthermore,\nwe believe that the consolidation of the latest advancements, as\nwell as the potential future direction (see Appendix), can inspire\nmore innovative works within the field of time series analysis.\nFoundation Models for Time Series Analysis: A Tutorial and Survey KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis work is mainly supported by the Guangzhou-HKUST(GZ)\nJoint Funding Program (No. 2024A03J0620).

Energy fore-\ncasting with robust, flexible, and explainable machine learning algorithms. AI\nMagazine 44, 4 (2023), 377–393.\nA APPENDIX\nIn this section, we discuss the future research directions and oppor-\ntunities of TSFMs from the methodology perspective.\nIncooporating Multi-modalities. As illustrated in this sur-\nvey, a majority of current foundation models for time series are\ndeveloped based on a single modality. However, many real-world\ndynamic systems are coupled with various modalities (time series,\ntext, even image data). It would be a promising direction to leverage\nvarious modalities along with the time series in TSFM to learn more\ncomprehensive and generalized knowledge, therefore significantly\nboosting the performance of different downstream tasks.\nExploring more Efficient Architectures. Currently, the Trans-\nformer serves as the dominant architecture for building the foun-\ndation model. Though promising, Transformer-based foundation\nmodels have quadratic scaling with respect to the sequence length\ndue to their self-attention mechanism. This makes them compu-\ntationally expensive and memory-intensive for processing long\nsequences. Therefore, it is an interesting avenue for future study\nto explore more efficient FM backbone architectures, such as state-\nspace models Mamba [37].\nDeveloping more Effective Pipelines. Time series data has\nunique properties such as temporal distribution shift [28, 91, 121]\n(i.e., the data distribution will evolve over time) and causality (i.e.,\ncasual relationship can exist between different points in the time\nseries) [99]. Therefore, it would be another existing as well as chal-\nlenging future direction to develop TSFMs that can well address\nthe temporal distribution shift or have a powerful Interpretability\nfor downstream tasks.\nProtecting Privacy. Protecting privacy is an essential concern\nwhen training foundation models on diverse sources and modali-\nties of data, which raises potential risks of exposing sensitive in-\nformation. As such, one future direction is the development of\nrobust privacy-preserving techniques for training the TSFM from\nmulti-source datasets, as well as keeping the utility of the trained\nFMs. This may include the advancement of federated learning ap-\nproaches, where models can be trained across multiple decentral-\nized devices or servers without exchanging raw data.\nKDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain Yuxuan Liang et al.\nTable 2: Summary of representative foundation models tailored for time series data modeling.
