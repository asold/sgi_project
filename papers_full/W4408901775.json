    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have immensely advanced the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with recent models being able to perform chain-of-thought reasoning and solve complex mathematical problems, ranging from theorem proving to ones involving advanced calculus. The success of LLMs derives from a combination of the Transformer architecture with its attention mechanism, the autoregressive training methodology with masked attention, and the alignment fine-tuning via reinforcement learning algorithms. In this research, we attempt to explore a possible solution to the fundamental NP-hard problem of combinatorial optimization, in particular, the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), by following the LLM approach in terms of the architecture and training algorithms. Similar to the LLM design, which is trained in an autoregressive manner to predict the next token, our model is trained to predict the next node in a TSP graph. After the model is trained on random TSP graphs with known near-optimal solutions, we fine-tune the model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The tour generation in a trained model is autoregressive one-step generation with no need for iterative refinement. Our results are very promising and indicate that, for TSP graphs up to 100 nodes, a relatively small amount of training data yield solutions within a few percent of the optimal. This optimization improves if more data are used to train the model.",
