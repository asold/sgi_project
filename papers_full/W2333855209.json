    "abstract": "Problems in high-power contactless power transmission systems using series and parallel resonance capacitors arise from the maximum voltage limit of the series capacitor owing to high reactive power. In this study, the characteristics of reactive power are analyzed using an equivalent circuit and the contactless power transfer system is designed considering reactive power characteristics. The self-inductance and the frequency can determine the distribution of reactive power at the primary side and the secondary side. In addition, the optimal winding number and size of the coil and the appropriate frequency are investigated by electromagnetic field analysis.",
