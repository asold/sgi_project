The source code is at\nhttps://github.com/hyer/HDFormer.\n1 Introduction\nDespite significant strides in deep learning-based 3D pose es-\ntimation [Iskakov et al., 2019; Qiu et al., 2019; Pavllo et al.,\n2018; Li et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2021; Gong et al., 2021;\nYe et al., 2022 ], achieving stable, accurate pose sequences\nremains elusive. The prevalent 3D pose estimation frame-\nwork takes 2D pose detection results [Chen et al., 2017;\nSun et al., 2019 ] as inputs and estimates depth information\nvia end-to-end Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) [Cai\net al., 2019; Pavllo et al., 2018 ] or Transformers[Zhang et\nal., 2022 ]. However, complex scenarios involving overlap-\nping keypoints, rapid pose changes, and varying scales pose\nchallenges to the depth estimation of 3D keypoints.\n(a) joint <-> joint (b) bone <-> joint (c) hyperbone <-> joint\nFigure 1: Illustration of first-order (joint↔ joint) attention, second-\norder (bone↔ joint) and high-order (hyperbone↔ joint) atten-\ntion. First-order attention models connections between joints, while\nsecond-order attention focuses on the relationship between joints\nand bones. High-order attention delves into intricate relationships\nbetween joints and hyperbones.\nFace with these challenges, existing methods mainly uti-\nlize first-order ”joint ↔ joint” and second-order ”bone ↔\njoint” connections, often overlooking high-order interactions\namong joint sets (referred to as hyperbones). Different\nfrom first-order (“joint ↔ joint”) and second-order (“bone\n↔ joint”) that focus on pair-wise joints/bones connections,\nhigh-order relations could describe complex motion dynam-\nics. The high-order interactions contain rich semantic infor-\nmation in motions, as skeletons often move in specific pat-\nterns and involve multiple joints and bones simultaneously.\nTo Learn high-order information without expensive costs,\nwe propose a novel framework named High-order Directed\nTransformer (HDFormer), which coherently exploits the\nmulti-order information aggregation of skeleton structure for\n3D pose estimation. Specifically, HDFormer leverages the\nfirst-order attention to learn the spatial semantics among\n“joint ↔ joint” relationships. Additionally, it integrates a ro-\nbust high-order attention module to enhance 3D pose estima-\ntion accuracy by capturing both second-order and high-order\ninformation. To encode the hyperbone features, the hyper-\nbone representation encoding module is employed under the\nconstraints of a pre-defined directed human skeleton graph.\nHDFormer strikes a commendable balance between efficacy\nand efficiency. In summary, the key contributions of this pa-\nper are summarized as follows:\nProceedings of the Thirty-Second International Joint Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (IJCAI-23)\n581\n• We investigate high-order attention module to learn both\nthe “bone↔joint” and “hyperbone↔joint” with an effec-\ntive and efficient cross-attention mechanism. To the best\nof our knowledge, it is the first end-to-end model to utilize\nhigh-order information on a directed skeleton graph for 3D\npose estimation.\n• We propose a novel High-order Directed Transformer (HD-\nFormer) for 3D pose estimation. It utilizes “joint↔joint”,\n“bone↔joint” and “hyperbone↔joint” information with a\nthree-stage U-shape architecture design, which endows the\nnetwork with the ability to handle more complex scenarios.\n• HDFormer is evaluated on popular 3D pose estimation\nbenchmarks Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP with anal-\nysis of quantitative and qualitative results. Specifically, it\nachieves 21.6% (96 frames) on Human3.6M without using\nany extra data, which outperforms the existing SOTA work\nMixSTE [Zhang et al., 2022 ] with only 1/10 parameters\nand a fraction of computational cost.\n2 Related Work\n2.1 3D Human Pose Estimation\nDespite progress in 2D human pose estimation, 3D ver-\nsions face challenges due to depth ambiguity. While some\nmethods leverage multi-view images/videos [Iskakov et al.,\n2019; Qiu et al., 2019; Ye et al., 2022; He et al., 2021;\nZhao et al., 2018; Huang et al., 2021; Qiao et al., 2022;\nHe et al., 2023], these setups are costly and complex. Hence,\nestimating 3D poses with monocular images/videos is more\npractical, with recent studies showcasing the efficacy of\nconverting 2D joint locations to 3D [Pavllo et al., 2018;\nZhu et al., 2021]. Strategies such as data augmentation have\nbeen used to generate diverse 2D-3D pose pairs, improving\ngeneralization [Gong et al., 2021; Li et al., 2020].\n2.2 Graph ConvNet Based Methods\nGCNs [Scarselli et al., 2009; Gilmer et al., 2017 ], extend-\ning conventional convolution operators to graphs, have been\nutilized in several human-related tasks like action recogni-\ntion [Shi et al., 2019; Shi et al., 2018; Xiang et al., 2022 ],\naction synthesis [Yan et al., 2019], and 3D human pose esti-\nmation [Zhou et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2023]. [Wang et al.,\n2020] created a lightweight, efficient U-shaped model to cap-\nture temporal dependencies. Inspired by [Shi et al., 2019 ],\n[Hu et al., 2021] proposed a conditional directed graph con-\nvolution for adaptive graph topology, enhancing non-local\ndependence. Other methods, such as Semantic Graph Con-\nvolution (SemGConv) [Zhao et al., 2019 ] and Modulated-\nGCN [Zou and Tang, 2021 ], also prioritize spatial joint re-\nlationships. However, they often overlook edge information,\nparticularly high-order relationships. Unlike Skeletal-GNN\n[Zeng et al., 2021 ] which utilizes GCN to capture action-\nspecific poses, we establish joint and hyperbone relationships\nvia cross-attention in the directed graph skeleton.\n2.3 Transformer Based Methods\nTransformers, first introduced by [Vaswani et al., 2017 ],\nhave been widely used in visual tasks [Zhou et al., 2022;\nTu et al., 2023; Cheng et al., 2022 ]. In the domain of\n3D pose estimation, [Li et al., 2021 ] proposed the Stride\nTransformer to lift a long 2D pose sequence to a single 3D\npose. PoseFormer [Zheng et al., 2021 ] created a model\ncomprising Spatial-Temporal Transformer blocks to capture\nspatial and global dependencies across frames. Similarly,\nMixSTE [Zhang et al., 2022 ] captured the temporal motion\nof body joints over long sequences. While CrossFormer\n[Wang et al., 2021 ] and GraFormer [Zhao et al., 2022 ] en-\ncoded dependencies between body joints, our method applies\na cross-attention mechanism to integrate high-order relation-\nships and explore the hyperbone-joint relationship. Although\ntransformer-based methods effectively capture global spatial-\ntemporal joint relationships, their computational costs signif-\nicantly exceed those of GCN-based methods.\n3 Proposed Method\n3.1 Preliminaries\nDirected Skeleton Graph\nThe directed skeleton graphG shown in the right part of Fig. 2\nrepresents the human skeleton structure, where the nodes are\nhuman skeleton joints and the arrows are human skeleton\nbones. Generally, the human skeleton can be represented as\na graph G = ( V; E), where the vertices are human skele-\nton joints and edges are physical connections between two\njoints. Here V is the set of N joints and E is characterized by\nthe adjacency matrix A ∈ RN×N . The raw pose data, i.e.,\nthe joint keypoints vector, is a set of 2D coordinates. In this\nway, the pose data is transformed into a graph sequence and\nspecifically represented as a tensor X ∈ RT×N×C , where T,\nN, and C denote the temporal length, numbers of joints and\nchannels, respectively. Directed graph is adopted, as it allows\na convenient hyperbone definition.\nTransformer\nOur model’s attention mechanism is built upon the original\nimplementation of the classic Transformer [Vaswani et al.,\n2017]. The attention computing with query, key and value\nmatrix Q, K, V in each head are depicted as:\nAttn(Q, K, V) = Softmax((QKT + A + Ψ)/\np\ndm)V, (1)\nwhere Q, K, V∈ RN×dm , N is the number of tokens, and\ndm indicates the dimension of each token. The multi-head\nattention of S heads is defined as follows:\nℏi = Attn(Qi, Ki, Vi), i ∈ {1, . . . ,S}, (2)\nMSA = Concat(ℏ1, ...,ℏS)Wo, (3)\nwhere ℏ is the attention calculation result for a single head,\nWo ∈ Rdm ×dm is the linear projection weight. A is the ad-\njacency matrix and Ψ is a learnable adjacency matrix. The\nmatrix A is fixed and represents the predetermined connec-\ntions between joints, while the learnable adjacency matrix Ψ\nadjusts the connection weights based on the input data, im-\nproving the capturing of spatial relationships between differ-\nent joints. The ablation study on the impact of Ψ is presented\nin line 1 of Tab. 7.\nProceedings of the Thirty-Second International Joint Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (IJCAI-23)\n582\nLinear\nLinearLinearLinear\nHyperboneRepresentation\nxScalexSoftmax\nJoint FeatureHigh-order Directed Transformer\nLinearx\nSoftmax\nLinear\nLinearx\n+ A\n+\nres(1x1)\nFirst-orderAttention\nFirst-order attention block\nNormNormJoint Feature\nHyperboneRepresentation Learning\nNorm+MLP+Joint Feature\nDistanceofShortestPath（SPD）\nLinearProjection\n...\n......\nNormJoint Feature\nInstantiation Function 𝝓(#)\nJoint Feature Selection\n：arethehyperbonefeaturesgeneratedbyℋ!,#\nSkeleton Directed Graph 𝓖ℬ!,#=SPD(𝒢,𝑖,𝑗)\nℋ!,#\n………𝝓(ℋ!,#) Concatenate\nScale\nFigure 2: The illustration of High-order Direction Transformer (HDFormer) block. HDFormer block consists of three major parts: (a)\nFirst-order attention block to capture “joint↔ joint” spatial relationship; (b) Hyperbone representation learning module to encode hyperbone\nfeatures; (c) High-order attention block to capture both second-order “bone ↔ joint” and high-order “hyperbone↔ joint” interactions.\n3.2 High-order Directed Transformer\nThe spatial connections between “joint ↔joint” and\n“joint↔bone” are referred to as first-order and second-\norder information in the 3D pose estimation, which is widely\nstudied in the previous works [Zhang et al., 2022]. Neverthe-\nless, pairwise first-order and second-order information alone\ncannot fully describe the complex human skeleton dynamics\nin the 2D to 3D mappings. For example, human skeletons\noften move in specific patterns and involve multiple joints\nand bones at the same time. This observation leads us to\nfurther investigate the high-order information interaction of\nthe human skeleton by integrating the high-order attention\nlearning with directed graph and propose a High-order Direct\nTransformer (HDFormer) for 3D pose estimation.\nFirst-order Attention Modeling\nThe joint sets of the skeleton describe the rough posture of\nthe human body, and the global multi-head attention [Zhang\net al., 2022 ] has demonstrated its effectiveness in 3D pose\nestimation. Therefore, the multi-head attention scheme is\nadopted in this work for first-order attention modeling. As\nillustrated in Fig. 2(a), A ∈ RN×N is the adjacency ma-\ntrix and Ψ is the learnable adjacency matrix which has the\nsame dimension as A. Specifically, given the joint token set\nZ = {z1 . . . zi} where i ∈ N denotes the index of skele-\nton joints, zi ∈ RC, C represents the feature channel. The\nfirst-order self-attention modeling and feature of joints can\nbe obtained by following Eq. 1, where query, key, and value\nmatrices are generated by three linear layers, Q = WqZ,\nK = WkZ, and V = WvZ, respectively. S represents the\nnumber of heads andℏk is the output of each head. Unlike the\ntraditional multi-head attention fuses the output of the atten-\ntion module with concatenating (Eq. 3), we revamp the fusion\nscheme with a simple accumulation:\nˆZ =\nSX\nk=1\nℏk, (4)\nwhere ˆZ denote the final output of first-order attention.\nHyperbone Representation\nA hyperbone is a series of joints and bones that are connected\nsequentially. The human skeleton can be represented as a\nspecial type of graph without loops, allowing for the unique\ndetermination of the shortest path between two joints. Given\na starting and ending joint, the corresponding hyperbone can\nbe identified using the distance of the shortest path (SPD).\nSpecifically, as shown in Fig. 2, the human skeleton can be\ndescribed as a directed graph G. The “hip” joint is defined\nas the directed graph’s root node. Given two joint nodes on\nthe directed graph, we could follow the direction of edges to\nfind the shortest path from starting joint i to j. For example,\nthere is a shortest path from joint index 0 to joint index 3 by\n[0, 1, 2, 3], which is done by moving from index 0 to index\n3 following the edges of the directed graph (bone for human\nskeleton). Formally, given the human skeleton-directed graph\nG and the (start, end) joint indices ( i, j), we could utilize\nthe SPD algorithm to discover the joint set belonging to the\nhyperbone Bi,j = {vhi, vhi+1 , . . . , vhj }, where v∗ represents\nthe human joint, |Bi,j| = n represents the number of joints in\nhyperbone, and we call this the order of hyperbone, h∗ is the\njoint index:\nBi,j = SPD(G, i, j), (5)\nTo encode hyperbone features, we propose a novel hyperbone\nencoding method. Specifically, the feature of hyperbone can\nbe obtained by a function ϕ(·) that takes hyperbone joint set\nBi,j’s corresponding features Hi,j = {zhi, zhi+1 , . . . , zhj }\nas input and generate hyperbone features, where zhi is the\nfeature of joint vhi.\nInstantiation\nPrevious works, e.g. Anatomy [Chen et al., 2021 ], used a\nsimple subtraction of joint features to construct bone fea-\ntures. In contrast, we propose a general process for construct-\ning both bone and hyperbone features, and offer instantiation\nmethods. Specifically, we investigate several instantiations of\nthe function ϕ(·).\nProceedings of the Thirty-Second International Joint Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (IJCAI-23)\n583\nSubtraction. ϕ(·) can be defined as a subtraction operation.\nAs we use a directed graph to represent the human skeleton\nwhen adopting subtraction for hyperbone representation, it is\nequivalent to the subtraction of start and end joints:\nϕ(Hi,j) = f(zhi − zhj ), (6)\nwhere z is the joint feature, f is a linear mapping. This repre-\nsentation is easy to calculate and works fine for second-order\nbone representation, however, it loses information on bone\nsequence for hyperbone with higher order.\nSummation/Multiplication. ϕ(·) can also be defined as\nelement-wise summation or multiplication for joints:\nϕ(Hi,j) =\nX\nz∈Hi,j\nf(z)/n, (7)\nϕ(Hi,j) =\nY\nz∈Hi,j\nf(z), (8)\nwhere n is the number of joints, f is a linear mapping.\nConcatenation. ϕ(·) can be defined with concatenation and\nlinear mapping:\nϕ(Hi,j) = f([zh1 , . . . , zhn]), (9)\nwhere the operator [·] represents the concatenation of features\nin the shortest path, f maps the concatenated feature to the\nsame dimension as the joint feature.\nSub-Concat. To overcome the sequence information loss\nissue in subtraction, we combine subtraction and concatena-\ntion for a mixed function for ϕ(·):\nϕ(Hi,j) = f([zh1 − zh2 , . . . , zhn−1 − zhn]), (10)\nwhere the second-order bone feature is calculated with sub-\ntraction and the high-order hyperbone feature is obtained with\nconcatenation and linear mapping.\nHigh-order Directed Transformer\nFig. 2(b) illustrates the architecture of our proposed High-\norder Directed Transformer block, which consists of three\ncomponents: first-order attention block, hyperbone encoding\nblock, and high-order attention block. The cross-attention\nfusion involves joint features ˆZ from first-order attention\nmodeling block and hyperbone feature H = [Y2, ..Yo, ..Yn],\nwhere Yo represent hyperbone features with order o from hy-\nperbone encoding block. Formally, the cross-attention fusion\ncan be expressed as:\nYo = [ϕ(Hi,j)], |Hi,j| = o,\nH = [Y2, . . . , Yn],\nQh = Wqh\nˆZ, Kh = WkhH, Vh = WvhH,\nCrossAttn(Qh, Kh, Vh) = Softmax(QhKT\nh /\np\ndm)Vh,\n(11)\nwhere Wqh, Wkh, Wvh are learnable parameters. Since we\nonly use the joint feature in the query, the computation and\nmemory complexity of generating the cross-attention map\nin cross-attention are linear rather than quadratic as in all-\nattention, making the entire process more efficient. Similar to\nMHSA [Vaswaniet al., 2017], we also adopt a multi-head at-\ntention design and add an MLP layer after the attention layer.\nLoss Function\nWe adopted the loss function similar to UGCN [Wang et al.,\n2020], which was formulated as follow:\nL = Lp + λLm, (12)\nwhere Lp is the 3D joint coordinates loss, which is defined as\nthe mean per joint position error (MPJPE), and Lm is motion\nloss introduced by [Wang et al., 2020], λ is a hyperparameter\nfor balancing two objectives and is set to 0.1. Motion loss\nallows our model to capture more natural movement patterns\nof the keypoints in the prediction, since Minkowski Distance\nloss does not consider the similarity of temporal structure be-\ntween the estimated pose sequence and ground truth.\n3.3 Network Architecture\nAs illustrated in Fig. 3, the proposed network architecture\ncontains three stages: 1) Downsampling stage collects long-\ntime range information by temporal pooling. The temporal\ndownsampling block has an inside temporal convolution’s\nstride set to 2 and kernel size set to 5. It is used to down-\nsample the temporal resolution; 2) Upsampling stage recov-\ners the temporal resolution, and skip connections are adopted\nbetween the downsampling stage and the upsampling stage\nto integrate the low-level features. The temporal upsampling\nblock is the conventional bilinear interpolation along the tem-\nporal axis to recover higher temporal resolution. 3) Merging\nstage transforms the feature maps at different temporal scales\nin the upsampling stage, and fuses them to obtain the final\nembedding. Finally, the 3D coordinate for each keypoint is\nregressed by a fully connected layer.\n4 Experiment\n4.1 Datasets and Metric\nExperiments are conducted on the 3D pose estimation bench-\nmark dataset Human3.6M [Ionescu et al., 2014 ] and MPI-\nINF-3DHP [Mehta et al., 2016a ]. Human3.6M is the most\nwidely used evaluation benchmark, containing 3.6 million\nvideo frames captured from four synchronized cameras with\ndifferent locations and poses at 50 Hz. 11 subjects are per-\nforming 15 kinds of actions. MPI-INF-3DHP is a 3D human\nbody pose estimation dataset consisting of both constrained\nindoor and complex outdoor scenes. It consists of 1.3M\nframes captured from the 14 cameras. For fair comparisons,\nthe evaluation metric MPJPE is adopted in this work, which\nfollows the setting of the previous works [Hu et al., 2021;\nCai et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2022; Zhao et al., 2022].\n4.2 Implementation Details\nWe optimized the model by the AdaMod optimizer [Ding et\nal., 2019] for 110 epochs with a batch size of 256, and the\nbase learning rate is 5 × 10−3 with decayed by 0.1 at 80, 90,\nand 100 epochs. To avoid over-fitting, we set the weight de-\ncay factor to 10−5 for parameters of convolution layers and\nthe dropout rate to 0.3 at part of the layers. Besides, we fol-\nlowed UGCN [Wanget al., 2020] to apply the sliding window\nalgorithm with a step length of 5 to estimate a variable-length\npose sequence with fixed input length at inference time.\nProceedings of the Thirty-Second International Joint Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (IJCAI-23)\n584\nX\nY\nZ\n2D\tpose\nsequence\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\nHDFormer\tBlockFirst-order\tAttention\nBlock\nTemporal\nUpsampling\nTemporal\nDownsampling FC\nDownSampling\tStage UpSampling\tStage Merging\tStage\n[B,\t2,\tJ,\tT]\n[B,\t16,\tJ,\tT]\n[B,\t32,\tJ,\tT/2]\n[B,\t64,\tJ,\tT/4]\n[B,\t128,\tJ,\tT/8]\n[B,\t128,\tJ,\tT/8]\n[B,\t64,\tJ,\tT/4]\n[B,\t32,\tJ,\tT/2]\n[B,\t16,\tJ,\tT]\n[B,\t16,\tJ,\tT]\n[B,\t16,\tJ,\tT]\n[B,\t16,\tJ,\tT]\n[B,\t3,\tJ,\tT]\n[B,\t16,\tJ,\tT]\n[B,\t32,\tJ,\tT/2]\n[B,\t64,\tJ,\tT/4]\n[B,\t128,\tJ,\tT/8]\n[B,\t16,\tJ,\tT]\n3D\tpose\nsequence\nFigure 3: Overview of our framework: A High-order Directed Transformer with a U-shaped design for 3D human pose estimation.

The proposed approach is com-\npared with the state-of-the-art methods to evaluate the per-\nformance. In this subsection, the reported performance in\ntheir original paper is directly copied as their results. The per-\nformance comparison with the state-of-the-art works on Hu-\nman3.6M [Ionescu et al., 2014] is listed in Tab. 1, including\ngraph ConvNet-based and Transformer-based methods. For\nfair comparisons with other SOTA methods, we consider not\nonly the effectiveness of the model but also the scale of pa-\nrameters and latency in Tab. 2, which can comprehensively\ndemonstrate the real-world performance of the model. To\nour knowledge, this is the first comprehensive comparison ex-\nperiment on the benchmark dataset Human3.6M. The current\nSOTA method MixSTE [Zhang et al., 2022 ], a transformer-\nbased model, achieves 25.9% and 21.6% MPJPE with the\ninput of 81 and 243-frame sequences, respectively. Com-\npared to MixSTE, the proposed HDFormer achieves 21.6%\nMPJPE with the input of only 96 frames. More importantly,\nour model has only a 1/10 scale of 3.7 M vs. 33.8 M and six\ntimes the speed. The graph ConvNet-based SOTA method\nU-CondDGCN has a very small scale of parameters, latency,\nand ideal performance. However, the proposed HDFormer\nis a transformer-based method that achieves significant im-\nprovement compared to U-CondDGCN with a very close\nscale of parameters and same-level latency.\nResults on MPI-INF-3DHP. In Tab. 3, we compared our\nmethod with state-of-the-art methods on the MPI-INF-3DHP\nbenchmark to evaluate the generalization ability of the pro-\nposed HDFormer. We take the ground-truth 2D poses as\nmodel input. Our method achieves the same trends as the\nresults on Human3.6M, which is also the SOTA performance\nunder the metric of PCK, AUC, and MPJPE.\n4.4 Qualitative Results\nAs shown in Fig. 4, we further conduct visualization on the\nFirst-order attention and High-order attention. The selected\naction (Eating of test set S9) is applied for visualization.\nFor the First-order attention map in Fig. 4(a), the horizon-\ntal and vertical axes are all joint indexes, and it can be eas-\nily observed that the dependency between the spine node\nand left/right elbow nodes are significant for the “eating” se-\nquence. Besides, the left shoulder node also plays an impor-\ntant role in the spatial relationship with the left ankle node\nwhen eating in the sitting pose. Furthermore, to demonstrate\nthe effect of the proposed high-order attention block, we fur-\nther visualize the high-order attention map for the action of\neating from the test set S9 in Fig. 4(b), where the vertical\naxes were the index of the joint while the horizontal axes\nwere the index of hyperbones. In our experiments, the maxi-\nmum SPD length was 4. As a result, the hyperbone sequence\nhas 42 bone features in the horizontal axes. From the atten-\ntion map, we can find that the hyperbone feature has an im-\npact on different joints. The left/right elbows and left/right\nwrist have a relatively large response to hyperbone sequence\nindex from 38 to 41, which corresponds to the higher order\nbone feature. The hyperbone 38 to 41 corresponding to joint\nProceedings of the Thirty-Second International Joint Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (IJCAI-23)\n585\nProtocol #1 Dir.

While\nin the merging stage, HDFormer block can fuse complex in-\nformation from previous stages and by high-order attention.\nExploration of Hyperbone Representation. The hyper-\nbone representation is a vital factor for the graph skeleton\nstructure, and we exploit the way of the hyperbone feature\nrepresentation. We conducted experiments by adopting 4th\norder HDFormer block with different instantiations modes,\nwhich can be seen in Tab. 6. We found that all the hyperbone\nrepresentation methods outperform the baseline, as they uti-\nlize high-order information. Among them, subtraction + con-\ncatenation boosts the performance over baseline by 4.0mm.\nIt shows that bone feature concatenation with shortest path\naggregation is effective for hyperbone feature representation.\nRole of Position Encoding and Multi-Head Attention.\nWe observed from our experimental results (line 2 of Tab. 7)\nthat incorporating absolute positional encoding led to a de-\ncrease in performance.

We also found\nextending the input frame numbers to 243 led to a slight de-\ncline compared to 96 frames as shown in line 4 of 7. The\nreason might be the small scale of our model (1/10 compared\nto [Zhang et al., 2022]) can not well capture temporal redun-\ndancy and noise in dense sequence.\n5 Conclusion\nIn this work, we propose a novel model named High-order\nDirected Transformer (HDFormer), which considers both\n“joint↔joint”, “bone↔joint ” and “hyperbone↔joint ” con-\nnections. Specifically, we propose a hyperbone represen-\ntation learning module and a high-order attention module\nto model complicated semantic relations between hyperbone\nand joint. We conduct extensive experiments to provide both\nquantitative and qualitative analysis. Our proposed method\nachieves state-of-the-art performances with only 1/10 param-\neters and a fraction of computational cost compared to re-\ncently published SOTA.\nAcknowledgments\nZhi-Qi Cheng’s research in this project was supported by\nthe US Department of Transportation, Office of the Assistant\nSecretary for Research and Technology, under the Univer-\nsity Transportation Center Program (Federal Grant Number\n69A3551747111), as well as Intel and IBM Fellowships.\nContribution Statement\nHanyuan Chen, Jun-Yan He, Wangmeng Xiang, and Zhi-Qi\nCheng contributed equally to this work as co-first authors,\nwith random ordering.
