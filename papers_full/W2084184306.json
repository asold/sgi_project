Furthermore, when animals that never use tools in the wild\n(such as monkeys [7] and rodents [8]) are experimentally trained de\nnovo, any modifications that are induced in the brain can be\ndetermined with neurobiological analyses.\nNew neurons are generated throughout life in the rodent\nhippocampal dentate gyrus, and this adult neurogenesis can be\nenhanced with enriched environments [9–11], physical activity\nand exercise [10,12–14], spatial learning [15], and buffer stress\nresponses and depressive behavior [16]. Exposure to enriched\nenvironments and complex social stimulations induce forms of\nneuronal plasticity, including long-term potentiation (LTP), in the\nhippocampus [17]. Therefore, neurobiological substrates that\nbridge the gap between spatial cognition and tool use-related\nvoluntary manipulation of spatial information can be detected in\nrodent hippocampi.\nDegus (Octodon degus) are ideal rodents for studying the neuronal\nsubstrates of tool use-related spatial information processing, as\nthey have a developed manual dexterity that enables them to be\ntrained to use tools [18]. In addition, degus have highly developed\ncognitive abilities. In this study, we compared hippocampal adult\nneurogenesis and synaptogenesis between tool use and spatial\nlearning tasks that required equivalent training durations. We\nspecifically attempted to determine if tool use-related tasks resulted\nin any specific changes in these hippocampal processes.\nMaterials and Methods\nAnimals\nAdult male degus (weight 180–260 g) from five litters were used\nin this study. Degus, which have a similar taxonomic classification\nas Guinea pigs, are diurnal rodents that are native to the South\nAmerican Andes Mountains in Chile. Their ecology and social\nsystems are unique and quite different to laboratory-raised\nnocturnal rats and mice. Degus live in tight-knit extended family\nunits and display complicated social behaviors, including com-\nbined maternal paternal rearing and rich repertoires of vocal\ncommunications [19–21]. Furthermore, since degus are diurnal,\nthey exhibit good visual discrimination. Finally, and most\nimportantly for the tool use task, degus have hands that contain\nhump-like hardened paw pads at the root that they can use as\n‘‘pseudo-thumbs’’ that oppose their other fingers (Figure 1A, top),\nwhich allow them to manipulate tools (Figure 1A, bottom). Degus\nused for the present study were bred and maintained in the\nlaboratory colony under a fixed 12-h day, 12-h night cycle at\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 March 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 3 | e58649\na temperature around 22 uC and humidity around 50%. Three to\nsix animals were kept in a large cage (45 670630 cm) with a food\ncup and water bottles (Figure 1B). Timothy hey was provided for\nfood and nesting materials. Food pellets, hey, and water were all\nprovided ad libitum. The degus lived with their littermates (or their\nfamily) in a wooden sleeping den and tunnel with a metal running\nwheel. These so-called ‘‘enriched environments’’ were mandatory\nfor proper maintenance of the degu colony, as previous reports\nshowed that chronic isolation and poor environmental living\nconditions induces a significant decrease in the density of\nNADPH-disphorase-reactive neurons [22], indicating that changes\nin the social environment interfere with the development of limbic\ncircuits. The degus were therefore housed in groups and in\nenriched environments to avoid any behavioral abnormalities,\nsuch as anxiety or offensive behaviors [23], that may have\ninterfered with the higher cognitive functions assessed in this study.\nEight degus were used for tool use experiments (task: 4, and\ncontrol: 4) and 7 were used for radial maze experiments (task: 3,\ncontrol: 4). There were no differences between control and two\nexperimental groups in genetic characteristics, hair colors and\nbody weight (control; 212.2 64.8 g (n = 8), tool use: 216.2616.0 g\n(n = 4), Radial maze: 228.7 66.2 g (n = 3), one-way ANOVA,\np = 0.31) when behavioral analyses initiated at 8–9 months old.\nWe selected these animals for the present experiments, as 1)\ntraining procedures for tool-use has been established [18], its\nlearning processes have not much variation, so as the standard\nradial maze task used as a positive control, and 2) Degus produce\nless pups per litter than standard rodents (mice/rats) which limits\nnumbers of age/sex-matched littermates for experiments. The\nexperiments in this study were approved by the RIKEN Brain\nScience Institute animal experiment committee #H22–2B216 and\ncomplied with all institutional regulations. Before being exposed to\ntraining, each animal was habituated to the training environment\nby being placed in an enclosure and being given a peeled\nsunflower seed.\nTool Use Training\nTool use training was carried out on a training platform\nconsisted of a training stage (20 63067 cm) and a transparent\nfence (4565560.5 cm) that separated the animal from the areas\nwhere the food rewards (peeled sunflower seeds) and tools were\nplaced. The rake-like tools were T-shaped, with a 4 cm long wire\nshaft, a rectangular plane (3 cm wide 61 cm high) made of acrylic\nresin, and a spherical grip 1 cm in diameter. The tool weighed\n2.1 g (Figure 1CD). Training sessions were monitored with two\nvideo cameras (Sony DCR-PC110) placed at the top and the\nupper-left side of the platform, and sessions were recorded with\na camcorder (Panasonic VDR-M30). After approximately two\nweeks of habituation, the training sessions were performed using\nthe successive approximation method detailed in our previous\nreport [18]. Training was conducted at two different levels (Level 1\nand 2), each of which consisted of two distinct sublevels (‘‘a’’ and\n‘‘b’’) of difficulty based on the relative position of the tool and the\nreinforcement (Figure 1C). The distance between the tool and the\nreward was initially very close (Level 1a), but was gradually\nextended (Level 1b). After the animal successfully learned this task,\nthe reward was then placed to the side of the tool so that the\nanimal had to move the tool laterally before pulling in order to\nacquire the food (Level 2a). Finally, the food was placed beyond\nthe tool, so the tool needed to be moved both forward and laterally\nbefore pulling in order to acquire the food (Level 2b). Figure 2A\nshows a representative example of a degu at the beginning of Level\n2a of tool use training. After a reward trial, half of a sunflower seed\nwas placed on the stage out of reach and the rake was placed\nwithin reach. On each training day, every experimental degu was\nput through one session that consisted of 35 to 40 trials. The\ncriterion for acquisition was an 80% success rate for three\nconsecutive sessions. Control animals were given the same number\nof food rewards, spent the same amount of time in the testing\napparatuses, and the food was placed in the same locations as the\ntool use group. The only difference was that control animals were\nnot given access to tools.\nRadial Maze Training\nThe radial maze consisted of eight equally spaced arms that\nradiated from an octagonal central platform. Each arm was\n64.5 cm long 640 cm high 611 cm wide. A food cup of 3 cm\ndiameter was placed at the end of each arm. Spatial cues\n(combination of different colors and shapes; a yellow star, a red\nsquare, and a green apple) were placed on the wall of the\nexperimental room (Figure 1E, F). Degus are able to color\ndiscriminate between ultraviolet and visible lights [24]. The entire\nmaze was placed on the floor. Prior to the training, the degus were\nhabituated to the training environment by placing them in an\nenclosure and giving them a piece of sunflower seed. Following this\nhabituation, the degus were placed in the maze with all of their\nlittermates for 20 min and food rewards were scattered throughout\nthe maze. Next, the degus were placed in the maze with three\nlittermates for 20 min and food rewards were placed only in the\nfood cups at the end of the arms. During the last phase of\nhabituation, degus were placed in the maze alone for 15 min and\nfood rewards were placed only in the food cups. After a habituation\nphase of approximately two weeks, the training phase was\nperformed. Degus were trained for 4 days per week, with five\ntrials per day. Rewards were placed at the end of three arms, and\nthe positions of the rewards were fixed throughout the learning\ntask (the locations of the rewards are indicated by the red circles in\nFigure 1E). All trials began in the middle of the same arm (green\narrow, Figure 1E). Degus were trained for 4 days a week, with\na session consisting of five trials per day. Degus were able to move\naround the maze freely. The trials ended when the degus found all\nof the food rewards in the maze. Trials were considered successful\nwhen a degu received all three rewards without any error entries.\nThe criterion for acquisition was an 80% success rate for three\nconsecutive sessions. Control animals were given the same number\nof food rewards, spent the same amount of time in the testing\napparatuses, and the food was placed randomly in the testing\napparatuses. The only difference was that control animals were\nable to get food rewards without remembering spatial cues. Radial\nmaze training was performed in the same room in which tool use\ntraining was performed.\nHistological Procedures\nImmediately after the acquisition of training was completed in\neither the tool use or radial maze task, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU,\n20 mg/kg body weight) was intraperitoneally injected for 4\nconsecutive days. Then, 10 days after the final injection of BrdU,\nanimals (12–15 month old) were deeply anesthetized by pento-\nbarbital and transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde\n(PFA) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The same procedures\nwere applied to control animals (the numbers of days control\nanimals were exposed to control conditions were equal to the\nnumbers of days experimental animals were exposed to experi-\nmental conditions). After postfixation by 4% PFA in PBS and\nsubsequent cryoprotection in 20% sucrose in PBS, coronal sections\n(35 mm thickness) were cut with a sliding microtome. Free-floating\nsections were permeabilized for 30 min in 0.1% Triton X-100 in\nPBS and were then subjected to immunohistochemistry.

BrdU is\nincorporated into the DNA of dividing cells and can then be\ndetected by immunohistochemistry in all of the progeny of these\ndividing cells. PSA-NCAM is expressed during an early phase of\nadult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus and is a marker of\nimmature neurons. We also used antibodies against PSA-NCAM\nand Synapsin-I to detect both newly generated and exsisting\nsynapses in the stratum lucidum of the CA3 region. Synapsin-I is\na synaptic vesicle-associated protein [25,26], and Synapsin-I-\npositive puncta that are present in PSA-NCAM-positive axons\nindicate newly generated synapses that originated from axons of\nnewborn neurons [27].\nTo detect neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus, the primary\nantibodies used for immunohistochemistry were: mouse anti-\npolysialic acid-NCAM (PSA-NCAM) monoclonal antibody (mAb:\nMillipore Chemicon, 1:400) and rat anti-BrdU mAb (abcam,\n1:300). The secondary antibodies used for immunohistochemistry\nwere: goat anti-mouse IgM antibody Alexa Fluor 546 Conjugate\n(Molecular Probes) (1:500) and goat anti-rat IgG antibody Alexa\nFluor 488 Conjugate (Molecular Probes) (1:500). For CA3\npresynaptic puncta detection, the primary antibodies used for\nimmune- histochemistry were: mouse anti-polysialic acid-NCAM\n(PSA-NCAM) mAb (Millipore Chemicon) (1:400) and rabbit anti-\nSynapsin I pAb (Sigma) (1:300). The secondary antibodies used for\nimmunohistochemistry were: goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody Alexa\nFluor 488 Conjugate (Molecular Probes) (1:500) and goat anti-\nmouse IgM antibody Aleza Fluor 546 Conjugate (Molecular\nProbes) (1:500).\nSampling and Double-blinded Analyses Using Confocal\nMicroscopy\nDentate gyrus neurogenesis. For analyses of neurogenesis\nin the dentate gyrus, two to three confocal images of double-\npositive signals in the dentate gyrus (resolution: 512 6512; visual\nfield: 250 mm square; confocal aperture: 135 mm) were acquired\nrandomly from each slice in a blind fashion using a FV500 laser\nscanning microscope system (Olympus). Two to four sections were\nused for each animal. Ten confocal images were acquired along\nthe z-axis (1.2 mm612) for each visual field with an oil-immersion\nobjective lens (PLAPO40X, numerical aperture 1.35, Olympus).\nDouble-positive signals were counted in a blind fashion by\na researcher who was not involved in acquisition of the confocal\nimages. Proper alignment and correct image registration of both\nthe laser lines (488 nm, argon laser and He/Ne laser 543 nm) and\nthe detection channels were verified with double-labeled fluores-\ncent beads (TetraSpeck Fluorescent Microscope Standards,\n0.5 mm in diameter, Molecular Probes). To avoid cross detection\nof green and red signals, images were sequentially acquired at 488\nand 543 nm, respectively. Because the corner of the dentate gyrus,\nwhere the upper and lower blades intersect, was the location\nwhere adult newborn neurons were most highly clustered, we\nacquired two to three images per field of the dentate gyrus to avoid\nwide scattering.\nCA3 presynaptic puncta. For the analyses of presynaptic\npuncta in CA3, two to three confocal images of double-positive\nsignals in the stratum lucidum (resolution, 1,02461,024; visual field:\n100 mm square; confocal aperture: 135 mm) were acquired\nrandomly from each slice, in a blind fashion, using a FV500\nsystem. Two to four slices were used for each animal. Proper\nalignment and correct image registration of both the laser lines\nand the detection channels were verified with double-labeled\nfluorescent beads (TetraSpeck Fluorescent Microscope Standards,\n0.5 mm in diameter, Molecular Probes). Eighteen confocal images\nwere acquired at a z-step of 0.6 mm with an Olympus FV1000\nmicroscope equipped with an oil-immersion objective lens\n(PlanSApo60X, numerical aperture 1.35, Olympus) and a digital\nzoom of 62.5. To avoid cross detection of green and red signals,\nimages were sequentially acquired at 488 and 543 nm, re-\nspectively. Colocalization was quantified using Image Pro Plus\n4.5.1 software (MediaCybergenetics). Synapsin I-positive puncta\n(Green) and PSA-NCAM-positive fiber (red) images were merged,\nand colocalized signals (yellow) were automatically detected in\na double-blind fashion.\nValidation of Histological Procedures\nIn previous reports [28,29], BrdU labeling of newborn neurons\nin adult animals was combined with Fluoro-Gold that was\niontophoretically injected into the CA3 subfield in order to detect\nnewly generated MF-CA3 synapses. Synapsin-I, a synaptic vesicle-\nassociated phosphoprotein, is thought to be the leading candidate\nto be an activity-dependent ‘phospho switch’ that regulates\nsynaptic vesicle tethering and release. Antibodies against Synap-\nsin-I have been widely used to visualize presynaptic terminals in\nthe hippocampal CA3 subfield. The immunolabeling pattern of\nSynapsin-I reveals large MF terminals [26] that consist of very\nlarge clusters (1–5 mm in diameter) that are densely packed with\nsynaptic vesicles [27,29]. Formation of presynaptic vesicle clusters\nis an essential step for synapse formation and the maturation\nprocess of newborn neurons [30,31]. In this study, antibodies\nagainst Synapsin-I and PSA-NCAM were used to assess the\ncapacity of newborn neurons to form synapses.\nVisual fields were randomly selected to count adult neurogenesis\n(subgranular layer of dentate gyrus) and synaptogenesis ( stratum\nlucidum in CA3 subfield), and no significant differences were found\namong slices from the same groups. When assessing the visual\nfields, the large Synapsin-I-positive puncta were situated directly\nadjacent to the apical dendrites of the pyramidal neurons, which\nFigure 1.

Because the large puncta were invariably located in the\nhilus and the stratum lucidum of the CA3 subfield, but never in the\nCA1 subfield [32], random acquisitions of images from the stratum\nlucidum were used to validate data.\nResults\nA total of 15 degus were used in this study. This number\nincluded degus exposed to tool use (n = 4) and radial maze (n = 3)\ntask trainings, as well as control groups (n = 4 for tool use, n = 4 for\nmaze). The procedure that was used for tool use training was\nreported in our previous study [18]. Figure 2A shows a photograph\nof a degu using the tool. The degu has grabbed the tool and\nmanipulate it to retrieve the reward (arrow/asterisk, a half of\nsunflower seed). Figure 2B illustrates the learning curve (shown as\nmedian 6 limits of variation) for Level 2a tool use behavior, which\nis critical to the whole tool use learning processes and revealed\na degree of difficulty equivalent to the radial maze task – more\ndifficult level 2b was not preferred in this study as its time course of\nacquisition tended to vary across animals and require much more\ndates compared to the radial maze task. The learning curves of\neach animal were aligned, and then averaged at the time point\nwhen animals reached the criteria for acquisition of tool use\nlearning (80% success rate for three consecutive trials). For\ncomparison, a straightforward spatial learning task that had\na similar learning curve was designed. This task consisted of an\neight-beamed radial maze with baits placed at the end of three\nbeams. Figure 2C illustrates the learning curve (median 6 limits of\nvariation, n = 3) aligned at the time point when the animals\nreached the criteria for the acquisition of the spatial learning (80%\nsuccess rate for three consecutive sessions where rewards were\nobtained without error entries). For both learning curves, the\naverage sessions, beginning 12 days prior to the completion of\nlearning, are shown (Figure 2BC, left). A post-hoc analysis ( t-test)\nconfirmed that there were no significant differences between these\ntwo learning curves (P = 0.16).\nBrdU was injected into the animals subjected to training once\nper day for 4 days after task acquisition (20 mg/kg body weight,\ni.p.). These animals were then fixed 10 days after the final BrdU\ninjections (Figure 2AB, right). In the right panels of Figures 2AB,\nBrdU injections occurred at day ‘‘0 0, and both the tool use and\nradial maze trainings continued throughout the 14 days shown\n(trainings were performed 4 days per week). The success rates of\nthe tool use and radial maze tasks were greater than 80% both\nbefore and after the BrdU injections. The control animals were\nexposed to the same number of training days, but with control\nconditions, and were given the same amount of food in the same\nexperimental apparatuses as the trained animals. Similar to the\ntrained animals, control animals were fixed 14 days after the initial\nBrdU injections. Instead of using idle naı¨ve controls, as is done in\nmany other rodent experiments employed to detect enhanced\nneurogenesis in various learning paradigms [17] or enriched\nenvironments [9], we employed enriched controls conditions\nbecause of the characteristic nature of degu habitats. Unlike other\nlaboratory rodents, such as rats or mice, degus require group\nhousing in a somewhat enriched environment in order to maintain\ntheir basic physical conditions. Degus subjected to isolation in\npoor environments, such as living alone in standard cages, develop\nsevere physical problems that may result in death [33]. Therefore,\nit was difficult to normalize naı¨ve controls.\nFive brain sections were randomly picked from 50 total sections\nthat covered the entire dentate gyrus, and were subjected to\ndouble-blind confocal microscopic analyses to detect adult\nneurogenesis by double-labeling of BrdU and Polysialic acid-\nneural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM), BrdU is a marker of\nnewly-generated cells and PSA-NCAM is a marker of immature\nneurons [34]. In all four (two experimental and two control)\ngroups of animals, the PSA-NCAM/BrdU double-positive signals\n(as indicated by the arrowheads in Figure 3A) were detected in the\nsubgranular zone (sgz, dotted line) close to the border of the\ngranular cell layer (gcl) and adjacent to the hilus. This area is\nknown to be a region that contains prominent adult neurogenesis\n[35]. There were no significant differences in the numbers of\nnewborn cells detected between the two control groups [for Radial\nmaze: 2.7860.24 (n = 27 sections, N = 4 animals); and for tool use:\n2.2760.26 (n = 11 sections, N = 4 animals); one-way ANOVA,\np = 0.37], indicating that the enrichment experiences between the\ntwo experimental conditions were well-controlled. Compared to\nthe combined average of the control groups [2.63 60.24 (n = 38\nsections, N = 8 animals)], the number of PSA-NCAM/BrdU\ndouble-positive neurons were significantly increased in the tool use\ntrained group [6.31 61.11 (n = 13, N = 4)] (one-way ANOVA, **\np,0.001), but not in the radial maze trained group [3.63 60.46\n(n = 16, N = 3)] (Figure 3B; one-way ANOVA, p = 0.30). In\naddition, the number of double-positive neurons was significantly\ngreater in the tool use trained group than in the radial maze\ntrained group (one-way ANOVA, * p = 0.006).\nHippocampal adult neurogenesis alters network functions\nthrough the continuous addition of new neuronal units to the\nnetwork. These new neurons extend long axonal projects along the\nmossy fiber pathways that innervate the target CA3 pyramidal cell\nlayer and make new synapses with dendrites of pyramidal cells that\nare located in the stratum lucidum [11,36]. In order to determine if\nthe tool use-induced newborn dentate neurons also had a greater\ncapacity to form new synapses in the CA3 subfield, immunostain-\ning with antibodies against Synapsin-I and polysialylated NCAM\n(PSA-NCAM) was performed on randomly selected CA3 sections\n(5 out of 50 total sections that covered the entire CA3 subfield)\ncontaining the primary mossy fiber tract stratum lucidum. Synapsin-I\nis a protein associated with small synaptic vesicles [37–39] and\nPSA-NCAM is a marker of immature neurons [34]. The\nimmunostaining revealed that clusters of Synapsin-I-positive\npuncta (green) were colocalized with PSA-NCAM-positive mossy\nfibers (red) in the stratum lucidum. A representative image is shown\nin Figure 4A (arrowheads). In this image, mossy fiber terminals (1–\n5 mm in diameter) with densely packed synaptic vesicles can be\nobserved [30]. To determine the probabilities of new synapse-\nformation, we assessed the ratios of double-labeled signals to total\nsingle Synapsin-I-positive signals [36]. The ratios of control, tool\nuse trained, and radial maze-trained animals were 0.38 60.02\n(n = 56, N = 8), 0.5460.04 (n = 24, N = 4), and 0.4060.04 (n = 24,\nN = 3), respectively (Figure 4B). The probability of new synapse\nformation was significantly higher in the tool use trained group\nthan the other groups (one-way ANOVA, * p ,0.01).\nDiscussion\nThe hippocampal dentate gyrus is known to be a location where\nnew neurons are generated throughout adulthood. These new\nneurons are sparsely integrated throughout the granular cell layer,\nand their numbers are enhanced by exposure to an enriched\nenvironment [9]. More specifically, the number of materials that\nare scattered throughout an enriched environment correlate with\nthe enhancement in neurogenesis, thereby indicating that new\nneurons may be necessary for the understanding of complex\nspatial structures. In this study, the control conditions that were\nused provided an enriched environment, due to the ecological\nTool Use Specific Adult Neurogenesis in Rodent\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 6 March 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 3 | e58649\nrequirements of degus as indicated above [19]. This enriched\ncontrol environment could explain why the straightforward radial\nmaze spatial learning task did not induce enhancement in adult\nneurogenesis, unlike previous reports where enhanced adult\nFigure 3.

The numbers of elements that needed to be\nlearned, and the difficulties of learning the spatial relations of the\nelements may not have been different enough between radial maze\ntask and the control conditions. Regardless, the data indicate that\nthere are elements of adult neurogenesis that are specific to tool\nuse learning.\nA previous report showed that reduction of adult neurogenesis\nby toxin affect fear conditioning paradigm but did not contextual\nfear conditioning or spatial navigation learning in Morris water\nmaze [41]. They discussed that new born neuron are involved in\nthe acquisition of memories which are dependent on the structure\nand, that all type of hippocampal-dependent learning involve new\nneurons for acquisition but spatial navigation learning can still\noccur with a very small percentage of new neurons [41].\nWhat are the differences between radial maze and tool use\nlearning? There are three major components of tool use learning\nthat may be more demanding than radial maze learning and may\nrequire additional hippocampal circuit resources. One difference\nwould be that tool use learning requires quantitatively greater\nnumbers of items and spatial structures to be learned. For\nexample, the locations of the beams and food need to be learned in\nthe radial maze task, while the tools, baits, hand movements, and\nvariations in different situations need to be learned in the tool use\ntask. A second and more critical qualitative difference exists\nbetween the two tasks. In the tool use task, spatial structures\nchange dynamically in time. When a tool is used to move food,\nthen the locations of the items in space are changed and the\nneuronal circuitry needs to encode the new spatial locations in\norder to predict the future spatial relationships of the items\n[42,43]. Finally, perhaps the greatest difference between the two\ntasks is that radial maze learning only requires ‘‘passive’’\nperceptions of existing situations, while tool use learning requires\nunderstanding of the relationship between self and spatial\nstructures and the ability to ‘‘actively’’ modify these relationships\n[44]. All three of these differences between the tasks indicate that\ntool use learning places greater demands on the neural circuitry to\nprocess information than radial maze learning.\nThe present study demonstrated that tool use learning induces\nadult neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of dexterous\nrodents (degus). These newborn neurons create novel hippocam-\npal neural circuits by projecting their axons via the mossy fiber\ntract to the CA3 subfield and by forming new synapses in this\ntarget region. These enhancements in adult neurogenesis and\nsynaptogenesis in the hippocampus may be necessary to accom-\nmodate the greater information processing demands placed on the\ncircuitry by tool use learning relative to simple spatial learning,\nand also to accommodate the unique relationships between self\nand spatial structures that change over time. The results indicate\nthat the central nervous system can adapt to new requirements\nthat emerge from physical conditions (degus have peculiar hands\nthat enable tool use), and that these adaptations may be dependent\non the enhancements of existing neural resources. The data\npresented here may ultimately be relevant for understanding much\nhigher human intelligence and cognitive functions.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank E. Kariya, R. Yamari, Y. Sato, A. Ogawa, N.
