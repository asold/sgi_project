  "abstract": "Effective, accurate and adequately early detection of any potential defects in power transformers is still a challenging issue. As the acoustic method is known as one of the noninvasive and nondestructive testing methods, this paper proposes a new approach of the classification method for defect identification in power transformers based on the acoustic measurements. Typical application of acoustic emission (AE) method is the detection of partial discharges (PD); however, during PD measurements other defects may also be identified in the transformer. In this research, a database of various signal sources recorded during acoustic PD measurements in real-life power transformers over several years was gathered. Furthermore, all of the signals are divided into two groups (PD/other) and in the second step into eight classes of various defects. Based on these, selected classification models including machine learning algorithms were applied to training and validation. Energy patterns based on the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) were used as model inputs. As a result, the presented method allows one to identify with high accuracy, not only the selected kind of PD (1st step), but other kinds of faults or anomalies within the transformer being tested (2nd step). The proposed two-step classification method may be applied as a supplementary part of a technical condition assessment system or decision support system for management of power transformers.",
