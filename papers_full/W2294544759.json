Up to 15% of morphologically identified Anopheles funestus mosquitoes in \ninsecticide resistance tests were found to be other species molecularly. The comprehension of primary \nand secondary malaria vectors and bionomic characteristics that impact malaria transmission and \nintervention effectiveness are fundamental in achieving malaria elimination.\nWith the call for malaria elimination, there is a renewed focus on understanding malaria transmission dynam-\nics towards implementing more efficient and targeted intervention strategies1. At present, malaria interventions \nrely primarily on long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS). Both reduce malaria \ntransmission by targeting mosquitoes that feed on human blood (anthropophagic), feed indoors (endophagic) \nand rest indoors (endophilic) and are therefore most effective in transmission systems where primary vectors feed \nindoors when people are asleep1,2. This was demonstrated in Kenya where primary vectors, Anopheles funestus \nand An. gambiae, which prefer feeding on humans and indoors, were shown to be more susceptible to LLINs and \nIRS, while the outdoor-biting An. arabiensis populations evaded intervention efforts3. Understanding small-scale \nvector bionomics is vital when malaria elimination is on the agenda4,5, as even small areas can act as strong foci \nfor transmission.\n1Eck Institute for Global Health, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA 46556. 2National Malaria Control \nCentre, Chainama Hospital College Grounds, Off Great East road, P .O.

Accurately identifying vectors and their bionomic characteristics are \nimportant when implementing effective interventions that also reduce residual transmission1,9.\nThe manner in which vector populations respond to these interventions and insecticide-associated selection \npressures is not well understood and largely dependent upon the local vector composition. Control measures may \nbe profoundly impacted by the development of physiological insecticide resistance10–12 and behavioral resistance - \nthe ability of a vector population to change its bionomic characteristics in response to an intervention13–17. In the \nSolomon Islands, indoor residual spraying with dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) initially controlled all \nthree primary vectors. Populations of the highly endophagic An. punctulatus and An. koliensis crashed and cannot \nbe found today. An. farauti populations demonstrated a shift to earlier and outdoor biting thereby circumventing \nthe indoor intervention strategy and maintaining a low level of residual malaria transmission13,15.\nThe two most prominent malaria vectors in Sub-Saharan Africa, An. coluzzii and An. gambiae, with varying \ninsecticide resistance profiles, can only be distinguished by molecular techniques18. Adaptive introgression19 - \nwhere a malaria vector species may obtain an insecticide resistance gene via hybridization with a sister species, \nis particularly relevant to this study as sister-species population dynamics may determine the spread of genes \nconferring traits important to malaria transmission. Identifying other related, morphologically indistinguishable \nspecies in the same region could highlight such issues and allow downstream planning. Other known and under-\nstudied malaria vectors such as An. rivulorum20, An. coustani21–23, and their complexes require further bionomic \ncharacterization to be able to better understand their contributions to transmission.\nSeventeen species of Anopheles (including several cryptic species) were identified using molecular techniques \nin the Kenya highlands24 - many of which were similar morphologically but displayed different bionomic traits. \nThis demonstrates how unexpectedly complex transmission systems can be, even in areas that have been studied \nfor many years. The presence of ‘unknown’ and novel vectors illustrates how the identification of some taxa can \nonly occur when appropriate molecular techniques are used alongside detailed morphological identification. \nEpidemiology and entomology studies as well as vector control programs must be strategically based on an under-\nstanding of key local vector characteristics, such as feeding preferences and insecticide resistance, while also distin-\nguishing vectors and non-vectors within anopheline cryptic species complexes, beyond the level of morphology25.\nMalaria entomology studies in Africa usually focus on identifying members of two groups - the An. gambiae \nand An. funestus complexes, as historically these primary vectors have made up the majority of collections. This, \nhowever, often results in morphological misidentification or discarding of unexpected or novel vectors. Within \nwell- and lesser- studied species complexes, new species are being discovered and phylogenies of these species \nare being further resolved using molecular techniques18,22,26–28. Collection sites may have diverse and unexpected \nanopheline populations, where detailed studies can expose diverse and unexpected arrays of secondary vectors24,29. \nMost studies rely on morphological identification with keys that may be outdated, contradictory, or difficult to \ninterpret. This is further complicated by collections with damaged specimens, presence of new or cryptic species \nand species with overlapping characteristics, and intra-species morphological variation. Accurate morphological \nidentification requires comprehensive training. By comparing molecular and morphological species identifica-\ntions from different studies, we found that interpretations of species distributions, insecticide resistance assays, \nhost preference studies, trap efficacy, and even screening for malaria parasites is largely skewed and sometimes \nentirely incorrect when using morphological identification alone. Identification of collections may bypass common \nmistakes and increase the level of taxonomic resolution, as well as contribute to a better association of species and \ntheir bionomics24.\nThough this concept is not novel nor surprising for morphologically identical and similar sibling species, \nthis analysis demonstrates misidentifications outside of species complexes. In this study, samples from several \nvector behavioral studies in high transmission areas of Luangwa and Nyimba Districts in eastern Zambia were \nanalyzed using the ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer region 2 (rDNA ITS2) and the mitochondrial DNA \ncytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (mtDNA COI), quickly evolving and repeated regions, to molecularly differentiate \nand identify Anopheles species and members of species complexes24,26,30–33. This study represents the first in-depth \nlook at species compositions in the Luangwa and Nyimba districts in Zambia. Identifying the primary and sec-\nondary malaria vectors in this area and their associated bionomic traits is vital for appropriate, targeted malaria \ncontrol interventions and accurate monitoring of their effectiveness.\nResults and Discussion\nMolecular species determination. ITS2 sequences representing 1847 Anopheles mosquitoes were aligned \ninto 18 sequence groups (hereafter called ‘species’) with a stringency of greater than 98% identity within each group \nto enable the maximum number of clusters. Small variations in ITS2 and COI sequences are strong indicators of \ndistinct species. The majority of species-specific PCRs used to identify Anopheles and other cryptic species based on \nminor sequence variations within these regions26,30,31,34. ITS2 sequences from this study are available in GenBank \nwith accession numbers KR014818 – KR014835.\nDistinct sequence groups were arbitrarily called Anopheles species (AN) 1 through 18 prior to a more in-depth \ndatabase comparison and species level identification. High similarity and the presence of voucher specimens \nallowed the identification of three species groups to species - AN12, AN14 and AN15 were An. funestus sensu \nstricto, An. quadriannulatus, and An. arabiensis respectively. Several species groups (AN3, AN4, AN5, AN10, \nAN11, AN13, AN16 and AN17) had high similarity to published sequences – but the absence of voucher speci-\nmens obviated an absolute species determination24. The presence of more than one species group that matched \na particular species (E.g. AN5, AN6 and AN8 matched An. coustani; and both AN18 and AN4 were similar to \nAn. rivulorum) indicated the presence of cryptic species or a complex of species. An. coustani s.s. has been shown \nto have a cryptic sibling species, An. crypticus21,22 - and our analysis indicates that, if one of these ‘coustani-like’ \nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n3\nScientific  RepoRts  | 5:17952 | DOI: 10.1038/srep17952\nsequences belongs to An. crypticus, there may be an additional member in the complex. The sequences from the \nfour groups (AN1, AN2, AN7 and AN9) did not share greater than 90% identity (when combined with sequence \ncoverage) with any nr database sequence(s) (Table 1).\nThe COI sequences of 284 mosquito specimens were aligned and the resulting distinct contigs (18 species) \nwere named as they correlated to the ITS2 groups (AN1-18). All COI sequence groups had a 1:1 relationship with \nthe ITS2 groups, supporting the presence of 18 separate groups of anophelines. COI database searches identified \nAN4 as An. rivulorum, AN7 as An. squamosus and AN9 as An. pharoensis. When COI and ITS2 results were com-\nbined, AN2 was identified as An. nili, AN3 as An. theileri, AN5 as An. coustani, AN10 as An. rufipes, and AN13 as \nAn. longipalpis. COI searches also identify several of the cryptic species seen as belonging within the An. coustani \ngroup (AN5, AN6 and AN8).\nWith limited database results, AN11, AN16 and AN17 were putatively described as An. pretoriensis, An. mac-\nulipalpis and An. leesoni, respectively. AN1 was not similar to anything in the databases but was identical to \nthe sequences (both ITS2 and COI) of a currently unknown malaria infected Anopheles species in the western \nhighlands of Kenya (“Species A ”)24 (Table 1). These sequences are available in GenBank with accession numbers \nKR014836 – KN014853.\nPhylogeny. Consensus ITS2 sequences were aligned to construct a phylogenetic tree. The ITS2 tree (Fig. 1) \ngroups putative species as expected based on their taxonomy. The An. coustani group (AN5, AN6 and AN8) clus-\nter separately as part of the Myzorhyncus Series. An. coustani and members of this complex belong to subgenus \nAnopheles, whereas the rest of the species seen here are members of subgenus Cellia. AN14 and AN15 (An. quad-\nriannulatus and An. arabiensis) cluster together as part of the Pyretophorus Series. The Neocellia series cluster is \ncomposed of AN10, AN11 and AN16 (An. rufipes, An. pretoriensis and An. maculipalpis respectively) while the \nCellia Series cluster is composed of AN9 and AN7 (An. squamosus and An. pharoensis). The ‘funestus-like’ species \n(AN1, AN3, AN4, AN12, AN13, AN17) cluster as part of the Myzomyia Series while AN2 (An. nili) stands separate \nas part of the Neomyzomyia Series. The only exception is AN18 (An. cf. rivulorum) that does not group with AN4 \n(An. rivulorum) as expected. This might be due to the presence of several insertions and base-pair substitutions \nthat would increase the divergence seen - though, without these changes, the sequence is highly similar to that of \nAn. rivulorum. The COI sequences of these 2 groups are very alike and group together (data not shown).\nPhylogenetic trees, combined with the stringent assembly and search procedures and the 1:1 match between \nITS2 and COI sequences, all corroborate that these final species assignments (Table 1) are valid. Only members \nof cryptic species (AN6, AN8 and AN18) and those with no voucher specimens (AN1, AN11, AN16 and AN17) \nremain putative identifications. There are 18 species present in these collections, an unexpectedly high diversity of \nanophelines in a single region of eastern Zambia, particularly in light of most vector studies in East Africa focusing \nprimarily on only known major mosquito vector species An. funestus and An. gambiae s.l, also present in this study.\nMolecular vs. morphological Identification.

However, when studying individual specimens and less \ncommon species, a comparison of molecularly and morphologically derived species identities reveals that some \nsamples were misidentified using morphological identification (Table 1). Most molecularly identified species were \nmistaken for multiple species in morphological identification. Morphologically, there were only 7 species identified, \nwhile sequencing demonstrated the presence of 18 species. Morphological identification did not identify any An. \ntheileri, An. pharoensis.

(including An. coustani and two unidentified An. coustani-like species – An. \ncf. coustani(1) and An. cf. coustani(2)) 94%, 82%, and 94% respectively were identified correctly by morphology \n(Fig. 2). Correct identifications for the less common species ranged from 37% (An. squamosus) to 79% (An. mac-\nulipalpis). Assuming An. funestus s.l. and An. gambiae s.l. act as the major vectors in this area, 6% were missed by \nmorphology and 10% of specimens were incorrectly assigned as these vectors. This does not take into account \nincorrect assigning of vector status for those cryptic species within species complexes that do not transmit malaria \n(see section below). In general, morphological identifications were more reliable for the more common species \nand those commonly assumed to be vectors or secondary vectors24.\nFigure 1. Phylogenetic Tree of ITS2 sequences. A majority rule consensus tree was generated from Bayesian \nanalysis of dataset of ITS2 sequences. Bayesian posterior probabilities are shown above branches.

Comparison of morphological and molecular identifications. The number of specimens identified \nas specific Anopheline species by morphological and molecular techniques (n =  2024), and percentage accuracy \nof morphology compared to molecular identity are presented. Molecular identification was determined by \nsequencing of ITS2 and COI regions and comparisons to the database.\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n5\nScientific  RepoRts  | 5:17952 | DOI: 10.1038/srep17952\nImpact on study analyses. The impact of morphologically indistinguishable specimens (cryptic species or \nmembers of a species complex) can be dramatic when trying to understand vector bionomics in a transmission \nsystem. The presence of specific An. gambiae s.l. complex members in Kenya and the differential effect interven-\ntions had on the three primary vectors (An. gambiae s.s., An. funestus and An. arabiensis) explained both the \nreduction and persistence of malaria transmission in the presence of high intervention coverage3. Morphological \nidentification alone could not have attributed persistence of transmission to a shift in species composition of the \nAn. gambiae complex.\nContrasting behaviors seen within members of cryptic species 17,20,25–27,35–37  and subpopulations within a \ndescribed species may further complicate the understanding of intervention effectiveness. In the current study, \nthe analysis of several bionomic traits was affected by the differences seen between morphological and molecular \nidentification (Table 2).\nSporozoite PCRs. When determining species identity morphologically, only 4 species (An. funestus s.l., An. gam-\nbiae s.l., An. coustani and An. pretoriensis) were identified as carrying sporozoites while the molecular analysis \nidentified 12 of the 18 molecular species positive for sporozoites (Table 1). A larger than expected number of \nsporozoite positive mosquitoes was found in secondary vectors, including An. rivulorum s.l. (2/30), An. theileri \n(2/14) and the An. coustani group (12/340).\nSporozoite PCR screening38 of 6,775 of 17,934 samples, excluding the insecticide resistance samples, enabled \nthe detection of Plasmodium DNA in mosquito heads and thoraxes. A positive result does not necessarily indi-\ncate the species to be vector (i.e. infectious) but does point to this possibility, as analysis of the head and thorax \nalone would not pick up parasite DNA from infected midguts. A total of 222 of the 6,775 samples were positive \nfor sporozoites (Table 1). This elevated rate of positives for each molecularly identified species is partly due to the \nnon-random nature of the molecular sampling. A proportion (all or up to 96 per collection (period, village, study)) \nof each morphologically identified species underwent both molecular analysis as well as sporozoite analysis.

Comparison of morphological and molecular identifications. This table compares morphological \nand molecular species identified in the 5 studies where Anopheline samples were obtained.

The \nnumber of molecularly identified samples from each study is presented.\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n6\nScientific  RepoRts  | 5:17952 | DOI: 10.1038/srep17952\nremaining mosquitoes all underwent sporozoite analysis with only samples with a positive sporozoite result being \nadded to the molecular analysis. Accurate rates of parasite infection in the field, therefore, cannot be inferred from \nthese data, though it is clear that more species than expected were positive for sporozoites.\nBoth the number of An. funestus s.s. collected (55% of specimens analyzed) and the high number of sporozoite \ninfections seen (n =  185) confirms it to be the primary vector in this area39–42. Other known vectors, An. arabien-\nsis42,43, the An. coustani group6,7,23, and An. pharoensis6,7,44 were also positive for sporozoites. Several species that \nare not considered primary vectors and some whose vector status is unknown were positive for sporozoites. These \nincluded An. rivulorum and its putative sibling species, An. cf. rivulorum, An. rufipes, An. pretoriensis, An. quadri-\nannulatus, and An. theileri24,45. Given the presence of Plasmodium DNA, these species may possess the latent ability \nto be epidemiologically important malaria vectors in this site20,23,24,45–47. Anopheles nili, An. leesoni, An. longipalpis, \nand An. squamosus, all known vectors6,7,23,27,45,48,49, were not found to be positive for sporozoites – though for some \nspecies very few specimens were available for testing (e.g. An. nili, n= 2). Though no sporozoites were found in \nsamples of AN1 (An. “Species A ”), this mosquito has been shown to be positive for sporozoites by both csELISA, \nPCR, and sequencing24 and has the potential to be a vector here as well. Presumed non-vector An. maculipalpis \nwas not found with sporozoites. When taking into account the presence of positive sporozoite PCRs and historical \ndata, 17 of 18 species are potential malaria vectors at this site, of which, only two (An. quadriannulatus and An. \nmaculipalpis) were not considered vectors. Identifying sporozoite positive mosquitoes from the field is often the \nfirst step in incriminating vectors.\nHost preference. When looking at host preference profiles, morphological identification demonstrated that An. \nfunestus s.l. were trapped more frequently near goats and cows than indoors (22.9%) as this species is commonly \nbelieved to be highly anthropophagic. The preference for animals was initially attributed to zoophilic members of \nthe An. funestus complex. When sibling species were identified molecularly, however, only 41.2% of An. funestus \ns.s. were found in human-baited traps with the majority caught from animal baited traps, confirming An. funestus \ns.s. to be a less anthropophilic population than commonly assumed.\nMorphologically identified An. gambiae s.l. (sibling species cannot be differentiated morphologically) preferred \nto bite cows and goats (92%) rather than humans (8%) but the molecular analysis demonstrated that 100% of \nAn. arabiensis were found in the human baited traps and none were found in the animal baited traps. Consistent \nwith published literature, about 4.8% of zoophilic An. quadriannulatus were found in the human traps and the \nremaining 95.2% were found in goat and cow baited traps. The large number of An. quadriannulatus (13% of all \ncollections) and the presence of positive sporozoite PCRs may indicate a role in transmission even with a low \npercentage seeking humans46,47,50.\nA similar effect was seen with the An. coustani s.l. samples where molecular identification teased apart the \nrelative host choices within the species seen while pure morphological identification cannot. When molecular \nidentifications were used, An. coustani was far more anthropophilic than its ‘sibling’ species with 50% being found \non humans while An. cf. coustani(1) was found on the animal baits 78% of the time and An. cf. coustani(2) did not \nseem to have a significant preference for any of the three baits used (human, cow and goat). Morphologically, An. \ncoustani s.l. did not have a preference for any bait. The high numbers of these three species combined with the pres-\nence of sporozoites and their bionomic differences indicates varying and niche roles in transmission in this area23.\nVector presence, trapping and species diversity. Both morphological and molecular species identification point to \nAn. funestus being the primary mosquito being caught, with the LTs catching a higher number of non-An. funes-\ntus species. The molecular data demonstrates that about 36% and 11% of the mosquitoes caught by the LTs and \nIfakara Tent Traps (ITT) respectively were non-An. funestus while morphological identification indicated that this \nnumber was 33% and 4% respectively. Types of traps that take advantage of their species-specific behaviors can \nmore efficiently sample specific mosquito species. For example, the anthropophilic and endophilic An. funestus \ns.s. was efficiently trapped in the indoor–simulating and human-baited ITT trap. Over these trapping periods, \nmolecular data demonstrated that the LTs trapped twice the number of species (15 species in LTs versus seven in \nITTs) and more of the primary vector species of these sites. Unlike the LT, the ITT did not trap any An. coustani \ns.l. (3 molecular species) and, the LT trapped 5x more An. gambiae s.l. This demonstrates that specific traps may be \nselected for and utilized for species-specific studies. The ITT would be useful at this site for studies on An. funestus \ns.s. (the major vector) while the LT would be more useful for investigations of other species or species diversity.\nMolecular analysis of samples from the comparison of LTs and ITTs (n= 903), demonstrated that another \nmajor mosquito species normally present at this site (An. quadriannulatus) was not identified in either the LT or \nthe ITT. This may be due to An. quadriannulatus being zoophilic and both traps used here are human or human \nhabitat based. In 2011, An. funestus s.s. comprised the majority (85%) of human landing catch (HLC) trapped \nmosquitoes in the indoor-outdoor study, while only one specimen of An. cf. coustani(1) was seen (0.01%) in the \nsample of the collections analyzed. However this was reversed in 2012, where most mosquitoes were the three \nmolecular species of An. coustani (75%) and An. funestus s.s. was only 10% part of the collections. This could have \nbeen a shift in species compositions after the implementation of IRS insecticides in 2012 that might have affected \nthe indoor feeding population of An. funestus s.s. A further in-depth analysis using molecular data is required to \nunderstand these differences.\nAn analysis of samples that underwent both morphological as well as molecular analysis from the indoor–\noutdoor study also demonstrates species differences - with the caveat that morphology alone is not sufficient to \ndistinguish some sibling species of mosquito complexes. In 2011, all 188 samples from HLCs, ITT and LT catches \nwere morphologically identified as An. funestus s.l., however, sequencing indicates the presence of nine species, \nof which An. funestus s.s. predominates. Anopheline samples (n= 17; 9%) misidentified include An. coustani, An. \narabiensis, An. nili, An. pretoriensis, An. quadriannulatus and An. theileri. An. longipalpis and An. rivulorum are \nmorphologically similar27 to An. funestus and were identified as such. Sequencing data also demonstrates that the \nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n7\nScientific  RepoRts  | 5:17952 | DOI: 10.1038/srep17952\nAn. funestus s.s. population, at this site, bites both indoors as well as outdoors and that there is a high diversity in \nspecies at this site including the presence several species with Plasmodium, that had not been demonstrated before.\nInsecticide resistance. Molecular identifications of An. funestus mosquitoes used for insecticide resistance tests \ndemonstrated that both An. longipalpis and An. arabiensis mosquitoes (both susceptible to lambdacyhalothrin at \nthis site) were included in the insecticide resistance tests for the primary vector An. funestus (which demonstrates \nresistance to some insecticides). A random sample of mosquitoes from each day of insecticide resistance testing \nwas sequenced. There were 3 An. longipalpis mosquitoes out of 19 (15%) sampled from a set of 30 total mosquitoes; \n2 An. longipalpis mosquitoes out of 14 sampled (14%) from a set of 15 total mosquitoes and a single An. quadri-\nannulatus mosquito was seen out of 7 (14%) mosquitoes from a set of 20. This could lead to a misinterpretation \nthe amounts of insecticide resistance within the population. This observation is particularly important when \nperforming meta-analyses. Since insecticide-resistance tests are often performed on a small subset of samples and \nthe results of those tests can be misinterpreted if there is a mixed species composition, molecular typing of samples \nused in these tests would be cost-effective and important for their accurate interpretation.\nThe collections from light traps and ITTs over time have the potential to look at the species-specific effects \nof IRS to understand their contributions to transmission and hence, improve intervention strategies. Between \n2011 and 2012, clusters in Luangwa and Nyimba districts received IRS (deltamethrin, lambda-cyalothrin and \nformulations of pirimiphosmethyl). IRS would be expected to reduce the densities of indoor-biting and -resting \nmosquitoes and could potentially drive changes in the behaviors of the various local species, depending on a spe-\ncies’ insecticide resistance status and inherent behavior (particularly exo-endophily). Using molecular techniques \nto accurately attribute insecticide resistance mechanisms and bionomic traits to the correct species is essential \nfor the understanding of these processes and determining the effectiveness of control strategies. Data based on \nonly morphological identifications can result in misleading conclusions and, therefore, impact upon strategies for \nselection of vector interventions and choice of insecticides.\nIt is important to note that the three major mosquito populations identified morphologically here - An. funes-\ntus s.l., An. gambiae s.l. and An. coustani s.l. – are all species complexes that consist of vectors with unique sets of \nbionomic traits that differentially contribute to transmission. The resolution of species identification offered by \nmolecular techniques, even using only a subset of the collected samples, is vastly greater than what is seen with \nonly morphological methods.\nEven under the best conditions, the limitations of morphological identification combined with misidentifica-\ntions, and the resulting lack of species-level detail, inhibit efforts to associate species with bionomic characteristics \nand can dramatically influence analyses of these studies. Downstream associations of vector status, entomological \ninoculation rates, and impacts on control based solely on morphologically identified mosquitoes may be very \ndifferent24 from those obtained from more precise molecular identifications. Correct identification is particu-\nlarly relevant when considering insecticide resistance and vector population level bionomic vulnerabilities to \ninterventions. This study reinforces the importance of combining molecular identifications with morphological \nidentifications and also points to gaps that lie between site-specific infrastructure and resources for molecular \nprocessing - morphological identification may be the only possible route at many research sites. Collaborations \nand building local infrastructure and capacity may help alleviate this disparity.\nA site -specific preliminary molecular characterization of mosquito populations, using sequencing or available \nPCR diagnostics, may be used to complement morphological approaches to determine the most efficient and cost \neffective strategy for the required detail of vector identification. Mosquito species that can be well characterized \nmorphologically without many misidentifications might not require further analysis while others (depending on \nvector status, contributions to transmission, study goals, etc.) may require further molecular analysis for confir-\nmation of species identities.\nThis study points to the effects of inaccurate interpretation of species composition in vector behavioral studies \nand the importance of molecular species identification of vectors when characterizing and evaluating transmission \nsystems. The thorough comprehension of vectors and their bionomic characteristics that impact both malaria \ntransmission and intervention effectiveness are fundamental to the malaria elimination agenda.\nMethods\nMosquito collections. Mosquitoes were collected in 2011 and 2012 in Luangwa and Nyimba districts, Zambia. \nSeveral studies and methods contributed to this collection of anophelines (n =  18,100). These included the use of \nhuman landing catches (HLCs), CDC-Light traps (LT) and Ifakara Tent traps (ITT) (n =  13,960)51–53, the evaluation \nof host choice using a Latin Square design (n =  1181)40, animal (cow and goat) baited tents in a host preference \nstudy using a cross-over design (n =  1661), and an indoor-outdoor behavior study (n =  1132). All mosquitoes were \nprocessed for morphological identification using appropriate keys49,54. An. funestus mosquitoes that were used for \ninsecticide resistance testing (2010–11) (n =  166) in the same area were also included in the analysis.\nSporozoite detection. All mosquitoes received at the University of Notre Dame (n =  5433; LT and ITT \ncollections: n =  3370; host choice study: n =  968; host preference study n =  1342; indoor-outdoor behavior study: \nn =  1095; and insecticide resistance collections: n =  166) were analyzed for sporozoites. Dissected heads and \nthoraces of female anophelines were analyzed with a nested PCR assay to confirm the presence of Plasmodium \nfalciparum and P . vivax DNA38.\nMolecular processing. A subset morphologically identified mosquitoes (n =  2040) from the collections \nabove (Table 1) were sequenced at ITS2 and/or COI loci for species identification. DNA was extracted from indi-\nvidual specimens using a CTAB technique. Briefly, samples were individually homogenized in CTAB extraction \nbuffer, DNA extracted with phenol and isopropanol and precipitated with ethanol. The ribosomal DNA internal \nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n8\nScientific  RepoRts  | 5:17952 | DOI: 10.1038/srep17952\ntranscribed spacer region 2 (rDNA ITS2) region was isolated by PCR using primers developed for differentiating \nother Anopheles species complexes32. The ITS2 region was amplified from genomic DNA using the ITS2A and \nITS2B primers32. The primer sequences were as follows: ITS2A 5′ -TGTGAACTGCAGGACACAT-3′  and ITS2B \n5′ -TATGCTTAAATTCAGGGGGT-3′ . The PCR mixture contained 2.5 μ l of 10X buffer, 200 μ M of each dNTP , 0.5 \nunits of Taq DNA polymerase, 0.75 μ l of 10 pmol/μ l each of forward and reverse primers, and 2 μ l of DNA template \nprepared as above. The thermocycling conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 5 minutes, 30 cycles of denaturation \nat 94 °C for 1 minute, annealing at 52 °C for 1 minute, and extension at 72 °C for 2 minutes, with a final extension \nat 72 °C for 5 minutes.\nThe mitochondrial DNA cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene was amplified using LCO and HCO \nprimers55. The primers used were LCO 1490 (5′ -GGTCAACAAATCATAAAGATATTGG-3′ ) and HCO 2198 \n(5′ -TAAACTTCAGGGTGACCAAAAAATCA-3′ ). The 25 μ l PCR mixture contained 2.5 μ l of 10X buffer, 0.2 mM \nof each dNTP , 1.2 mM MgCl2, 0.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase, 0.75 μ l of 10 pmol/μ l each of forward and reverse \nprimers, and 1 μ l of DNA template prepared as above. The thermocycling conditions were as follows: 94 °C for \n5 min, 5 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 40 s, annealing at 45 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1.5 min; \nthen 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 40 s, annealing at 51 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1.5 min; \nwith a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min.\nAll specimens were initially amplified with ITS2 primers. Those specimens that did not amplify with ITS2 prim-\ners, and specimens corresponding to every novel ITS2 sequence were amplified with COI primers. The amplified \nfragments were visualized by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel. The PCR product was purified using an enzyme \ncleanup: 2U of Exonuclease 1 (USB Corporation, Cleveland, OH), 1U of Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase (USB), and \n1.8 μ l of ddH20 were added to 8 μ l of PCR product. This mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, followed by \n15 min at 80 °C to inactivate the enzymes. The PCR products were sequenced directly (with one of the PCR primers) \nusing Sanger sequencing on ABI 3730xl DNA Analyzer platform (PE Applied Biosystems, Warrington, England).\nSequence Analysis. Raw ITS2 sequences were initially aligned using the Seqman pro assembler (Lasergene v \n10.1.1) with a minimum match of 95%. Assembled contigs were manually examined for insertions, deletions and \nrepeat structures that may impact assembly, inflate divergence and decrease identity scores. These contigs were \nthen further divided into sub-contigs based on consistent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A limit of 98% \nidentity was used to assemble ITS2 sequences into final “species groups” . Low quality or contaminated sequences \nwere not included in the analysis. The consensus sequences of these ITS2 contigs were compared (BLASTn) to the \nNCBI nr database for species identification.\nThe COI sequences were similarly assembled and compared to the NCBI nr and BOLD56 databases for con-\nfirmation of species identities. Sequence groups (henceforth called ‘species’) were merged (minimum identity of \n94%) when COI BLAST results indicated that they belonged to the same species for a final minimum match of \ngreater than 95%. These sequences were compared (BLASTn) to the NCBI nr database.\nSpecies Identification. Sequences were analyzed without regard to morphological identification. Single \nsequence contigs were not included in this analysis. High sequence identity (99% or greater) to voucher specimen \nsequences in the database was primarily used for final species confirmation. COI and ITS2 database comparison \nresults were combined to determine species when either COI or ITS2 alone did not produce significant results to \nvoucher specimens24. An initial threshold of 98% was lowered to 94% for COI groups as mitochondrial lineages \ncan diverge more than ITS2 sequences within a species31,33. COI group sequences with less than 98% identity that \nmatched the same anopheline species reference sequence were collapsed into one group. Lower COI sequence \nsimilarity was observed within a final species group than ITS2 sequences. To validate the proper assembly of these \nsequences, manual inspections were performed to ensure that sequence differences such as insertions, deletions and \nrepeat regions did not inflate divergence and decrease identity scores. The manually examined consensus sequences \nof each group were compared (BLASTn) to the NCBI nr database to identify species if possible. A high degree of \nsimilarity combined with the presence of voucher specimens allowed the identification of species groups to species.\nPhylogenetic analysis. ITS2 sequences were initially annotated in a web interface for ITS2 delimitation \naccessible at the ITS2-DB (http://its2.bioapps.biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de). This database utilizes comprehensive \nHidden Markov Model (HMM) approach to define the boundaries (start and end positions) of the ITS2 region, \nby comparing to a conserved structural motif at 5.8S/28S rRNA regions. The ITS2 sequences were then aligned \nin MAFT57 using X-INS-i58. This alignment method detects conserved secondary structures in non-coding RNA \nsequences and is based on the Four-way Consistency objective function to build a multiple alignment by combining \nSCARNA algorithm for the initial pairwise alignments58. Sequences were aligned using default settings in OPAL59 \nas implemented in in Mesquite 3.0160. Separate analyses for each sequence was done using Bayesian approach in \nMrBayes v3.1.261 using a general time reversible (GTR) substitution model (COI tree analysis is not shown). Each \nanalysis was performed with two independent runs with four chains and each run was carried out for 10,000,000 \ngenerations with a sample frequency of 1000. The first 25% trees were discarded as burn-in and the posterior \nprobabilities were estimated from the remaining trees to infer branch support.\nReferences\n1. malERA Consultative Group on Vector Control.
