    "abstract": "Abstract Electrical or thermal failure that occurred in the transformer oil can produce a dangerous gas called gas fault. By indicating the content of dissolved gases in the transformer oil, can be obtained information about what happened to the oil so it can be estimated indication of the type and cause of the failure in the transformer. The method used to identify and analyze the dissolved gases in oil is called Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA). In this study conducted by the DGA Duval Triangle method for transformer oil used in geothermal power plant UPJP Kamojang PT. Indonesia Power. The results using Duval Triangle method produces thermal failure and partial discharge.",
