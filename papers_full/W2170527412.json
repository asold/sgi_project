Based on the above examples and principles, we then return to the general case, and discuss\nthe application of data-driven workﬂows in catalyst discovery and optimisation.\n1. Introduction\nResearch in the discovery of novel heterogeneous catalysts faces\nan enormous challenge in years to come. With the now\ncommonly acknowledged abundance of fossil resources like\nshale gas, reneries around the world will shi feedstocks from\noil to gas. This requires novel catalytic pathways to, for example,\nC\n2–C4 olens1–4 and aromatics.5–7 Where many of these mole-\ncules are now extracted from oil or its subsequent cracking\nproduct in the rening process, novel processes are needed\nconsidering light alkanes like methane, ethane and propane as\nthe feeds.\n8,9 Concurrently, the eld of biomass conversion is\nmaturing. Several processes producing building blocks based\non biomass will come online in the next two decades. In this\narea, catalytic processes are required for converting these\nbuilding blocks to products. These products include both drop-\nins like ethylene from ethanol,\n10 butanediol from succinic acid11\nand aromatics from alcohols,12 as well as new-to-world products\nlike furan dicarboxylic acid (FDCA),13,14 a novel monomer for\npolyesters, and farnesene, 15,16 a novel fuel and lubricant\ncomponent. Regardless the nature of thenal product– catal-\nysis will be needed to perform thenal steps of the process.\nSince catalysis research is a multifaceted problem, involving\nvariations in catalyst composition and experimental conditions,\na systematic research methodology is required. Doing only\nexperiments is not enough. The experiments are better\ncombined with modelling at various degrees of complexity is\nrequired to eﬀectively discover catalysts for new or existing\nprocesses.\nApplying modelling methods will benet all stages of catalyst\ndevelopment, provided that the appropriate level of complexity\nis applied at each stage. As a general rule, model complexity\nshould increase as a project progresses. Initial stages need\nrelatively simple methods from chemometrics (exploratory data\nanalysis) and experimental design (empirical modelling). Later\nstages will benet from more rigorous, kinetic models. Note\nthat the“users” of models and data diﬀer at the various stages.\nIn early stages, the target audience is mostly composed of\nresearch chemists. Later, the focus shis to providing chemical\nengineers with su ﬃcient information to design pilot-scale\nprocesses. Indeed, involving the engineers from the start is the\nkey to success.\n17,18\nThis tutorial focuses on empirical modelling methods,\nillustrating them with three case studies: rst, we discuss\nstatistical experimental design on the oxidative coupling of\nmethane. This chemistry is receiving an increased amount of\na t t e n t i o ni nb o t ha c a d e m i aa n di n d u s t r y\n19,20 with the expected\np r i c ed e v e l o p m e n t sf o rm e t h a n er e s u l t i n gf r o ms h a l eg a s\nproduction. Then, we review the use of exploratory data\nanalysis with principal component analysis (PCA) and\ndescriptor –performance relationships using hydrogenation of\n5-ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF).\n21–23 Finally, we explain the\ndevelopment of generic descriptors for metals using a\ncomputationally-derived dat abase of heats of adsorption of\ngases on metals.\n24 The latter approach is then validated\nagainst the experimentally measured adsorption of gases on\ntitania-supported metals.\naAvantium Chemicals B.V., Zekeringstraat 29, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

Specic\ninformation on the various uses, strengths and weaknesses of\nparallel reactors are available elsewhere.\n18,25,26\n2. Typical work ﬂow for catalyst\ndevelopment\nTo understand better the use of empirical modelling methods,\nlet usrst examine the unit operations of the typical workow\nfor catalyst development (Fig. 1). The guiding principle of this\nworkow is that it is an iterative process, not a linear one. Aer\neach set of experiments, the results are compared against the\nobjectives. If these are met, you may proceed to next stage.\nOtherwise, if the data indicates that your initial objectives are\nunrealistic, these objectives must be adjusted.\nThe empirical modelling methods (highlighted in green in\nFig. 1) are the focus of this tutorial. We also discuss briey some\nother elements of the workow, namely catalyst synthesis and\ntesting.\n2.1. General comments regarding precursor selection and\ncatalyst synthesis\nThe key to a successful scale-up of catalyst synthesis is using\nsimple methods. Straightforward steps like impregnation and\nprecipitation can be scaled up relatively quickly to produce\nkilograms of catalyst. Even for the simplest impregnation\n(Fig. 2) many steps and variables have to be considered. Since\nseveral excellent books have been published on this subject,\n27,28\nwe only highlight a few key points here.\nFirst, we consider the starting materials. Commercially\naccessible materials are preferable. This holds for both the\ncarrier, in the case of a supported catalyst, and for the metal\nprecursors. We also keep in mind the conditions that the\ncatalyst will be exposed to during its synthesis and testing. The\ns u p p o r tm u s tm a i n t a i ni t ss t r u c tural integrity during calci-\nnation and reduction. Well known examples include the\nanatase–rutile transformation observed for titania\n29 and ceria\nstructural collapse30 at high temperature. The precursor salt\nshould be readily transformed to an oxide or metal during\ncalcination and/or reduction. As a rule of thumb, metal\nnitrates are preferable over chlorides. Most nitrates require\ncalcination temperatures between 250 and 400\n/C14 C, while\nchlorides typically require temperatures between 500 and\n700 /C14 C. If a metal is prone to sintering or agglomeration, its\nchloride precursor is more likely to give a lower active metal\nsurface area. Likewise, organ ic anions such as acetate or\noxalate introduce the risk of carbon deposits on the catalysts.\nExamples of catalysts that can be synthesized using straight-\nforward methods in the laboratory are Pd/Al\n2O3 for hydroge-\nnation31 and AuPd/SiO2 for vinyl acetate synthesis from acetic\nacid and ethylene.32\nThe accuracy of small-scale preparations (milligrams to\ngrams of catalyst) benets from minimizing the number of\nsteps (i.e. running a more dilute, single-step impregnation). In\nthe case of bimetallic (or multimetallic) catalysts you must\nchoose between single-step (co-impregnation) and sequential\nimpregnation. We advise trying out both methods on a small\nnumber of catalysts before preparing large libraries. Co-\nimpregnation is simpler, but sequential impregnation is pref-\nerable when the diﬀerence in solubility for two precursor salts is\nlarge. One such example is the synthesis of the supported Pt–Sn\ncatalyst used in the reduction ofa,b-unsaturated aldehydes and\nthe dehydrogenation of alkenes to olens or aromatics. Here\nthe solubility of platinum nitrate is high, while the solubility of\ntin acetate is low. Unless you need very low tin loadings, this\nimpregnation requires two (or more) steps.\n33\nWhen considering parallel reactors for catalyst testing,\ncertain compromises will have to be made in catalyst synthesis.\nConsistency here is of the utmost importance to avoid\nconfusing catalyst components and catalyst synthesis being\nresponsible for activity. Ideally, in each set of experiments, the\nsynthesis of catalysts is kept as constant as possible. This\napplies to the precursors used, the synthesis method, and the\npost-synthesis steps (drying, calcinations, reduction). Not all\ncatalysts will be prepared using optimized conditions. To\nminimize the risk of “missing out” on potentially promising\nleads, it is good practice to at various stages in a research\nprogram include subsets of experiments where these parame-\nters are addressed or revisited. Especially in early stages of a\nstudy, an experimental campaign that probes the impact of\nsynthesis variables on the performance of a limited set of\ncatalysts is valuable. First, the information can be translated in\na synthesis protocol for use during screening. Second, the\nFig. 1 Flow diagram representing a typical workﬂow for the devel-\nopment of (heterogeneous) catalysts.\n5964 | RSC Adv.,2 0 1 4 ,4, 5963–5974 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2014\nRSC Advances Review\nOpen Access Article.

General comments regarding catalyst testing\nWhen testing a catalyst library, dening a uniform test protocol\nis important. Here the key parameters are the activation\nprocedure, the catalysts' stability, the reference conditions, and\nthe analysis methods. In the following paragraphs we briey\naddress these topics. A more detailed discussion of common\nsynthesis methods and testing protocols is given in the books\nedited by Ertl\n27 and Regalbuto.28\nFirst, let us consider the catalyst activation procedure. Oen,\na simple reduction step followed by a short equilibration with\nthe feedstock will su ﬃce. One notable exception is hydro-\ndesulphurization, which requires a sul ding step using a\nsulphur donor (typically H\n2S, polysuldes or Me2S2). Another is\nthe Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, where the catalyst must be\nequilibrated under reaction conditions for up to two weeks\nbefore reaching steady-state performance.\n34 While the optimal\nactivation method may di ﬀer between individual catalysts,\nusing a consistent testing method makes comparing the\nperformance data easier.\n35\nThe second factor we must consider is catalyst stability. If\ncatalysts are known to have a limited lifetime, the number of\nexperimental conditions that can be explored needs to be\nlimited. In case lifetime is not a concern, longer run times can\nbe used and thus more data points per catalyst can be obtained.\nIn aow reactor the experimental conditions that can easily be\nvaried on stream are (a) temperature (b) space velocity (c)\npressure and (d) feed composition. If the experimental condi-\ntions are varied during testing, you must frequently return to a\nreference condition with known performance. As long as this\nperformance does not change, you can assume the catalyst has\nnot changed.\n18\nIn most cases, the compositional analysis of products is the\nbottleneck of catalyst testing. This is true even for simple gas-\nphase reactions. The common techniques are chromatography\nand spectroscopy. The key advantage of chromatography is that\nthe components in the reactor eﬄuent are separated and thus\neasily quantied. The disadvantage is the time-consuming\nanalysis. Assuming the composition of reactor eﬄuent can be\ndetermined in ve minutes using GC, one still needs overve\nhours to analyse 64 reactors.\n36 Conversely, spectroscopic anal-\nysis enjoys the advantage of speed, but suﬀers from the fact that\nall components are analyzed simultaneously. This means the\nconcentrations of individual components must be extracted by\nmeans of multivariate calibration and/or deconvolution.\n37,38\n3. Integrating modelling methods in\ncatalyst research\nFor clarication, we will divide the modelling methods in\ncatalysis in two groups: fundamental and empirical (Fig. 3). The\nrst group, which includes computational chemistry, kinetic\nmodeling and reactor design, focuses on reaction mechanisms\nand engineering principles. Such methods are useful when\nmechanistic information and/or reactor constraints are avail-\nable a priori. The second group includes data-driven models\nthat make no assumptions on reaction mechanism or the\nreactor conguration. They can therefore be applied early in the\nresearch when little information is available.\nIn contrast to popular belief, modelling methods in catalysis\nare best used in an integrated manner. Synergy is achieved only\nby close collaboration between the modelling and experimental\nteams. The largest hurdle here is the “language barrier ”\nbetween researchers from diﬀerent disciplines. Strikingly, the\nempirical (data-driven) methods pose the most diﬃculties. This\nis because they are typically practiced by statisticians rather\nthan chemists or chemical engineers. In this tutorial, we will\nhighlight the useful information obtainable by combining\nempirical models with experiments.\nStatistical experimental design and principal component\nanalysis are known methods, and using them during research\nwill not lead to the discovery of new catalysts as such. It will,\nhowever, lead to a more detailed understanding of the impact of\nprocess parameters on catalytic performance. Moreover, you\nFig. 2 Typical steps in catalyst synthesisvia impregnation.

Thus, using these existing\nmethods as an integrated part of catalyst development will\nenhance the chances of identifying new avenues.\n3.1. Statistical experimental design\nUsing appropriate experimental design methods will increase\nthe chances of success for a project in all its stages, from very\nearly screening to thenal optimization of catalyst composition\nand process conditions. The key here is selecting the proper\nvariables. The more complex your system, the more experi-\nments you'll need for exploring the parameter space. But\nexperimental design does more than just minimize the number\nof experiments. It also ensures that you run the correct type of\nexperiments.\nA typical experimental design campaign has three main\nstages: (1) factor screening, (2) optimization and (3) robustness\ntesting. During factor screening, a large number of variables is\nexplored using a small number of experiments. The objective\nhere is eliminating variables that have only a small eﬀect on the\nperformance. Only the variables that have relevance progress to\nstage (2), the optimization stage. This stage then provides a\nquantitative relationship between the variables and the\nresponses. The robustness stage (3) is a sensitivity analysis,\nproviding an assessment of the expected stability of the opti-\nmized system.\nA good experimental design also allows the data to be\nanalyzed as a model instead of as a mere collection of points. As\nan example, let us consider of the behaviour of a Mn-promoted\nNa\n2WO4/SiO2 catalyst in the oxidative coupling of methane. We\ntested this catalyst in a 64-channel parallelxed bed reactor at\nvarious experimental conditions. The temperature was varied\nover the range 755–875\n/C14 C, the pressure over the range 0–2.5\nbarg, the GHSV over the range 6000 –36 000 h/C0 1 and the\nmethane to oxygen stoichiometry over the range 4–8 molar\nequivalents. With so many variations, the raw data for even a\nsingle catalyst is overwhelmingly complex (Fig. 4).\nHowever, since the conditions were varied systematically, we\ncan calculate a response surface model. Here, the parameters\n(temperature, pressure, GHSV and stoichiometry) are related to\nthe responses (conversion, yields, selectivities). The resulting\nmodels can be used to identify the optimal conditions that will\ngive optimal performance. As an example, Fig. 5 shows a set of\nresponse surfaces based on the data shown in Fig. 4. We see that\nthe highest methane conversions are found at the lowest space\nvelocities combined with the highest temperature. Less obvious\nfrom the raw data, but very clear from the response surfaces: the\ntemperature required to achieve maximum C2 yield shis from\n875\n/C14 C at 0 barg to 825 /C14 C at 2.5 barg. Another important\nobservation is that the absolute maximum C2 yield is 16% at 2.5\nbarg, whereas at 0 barg a maximum yield of 19% can be\nobtained. For clarity, we show here only two of the key\nresponses, but the other two (CO\n2 selectivity and ethylene–\nethane ratio) can also be described by similar models.\nNote that response surface models typically use continuous\nparameters and responses. When categorical parameters are\nused (for example“good” or “bad” performance or“support 1”\nand “support 2”), separate response surfaces have to be con-\nstructed for each setting.39,40 Alternatively, one can use classi-\ncation models.\n3.2. Explorative data analysis\nData overload is a big problem with parallel experiments. The\nbest solution is using a database for storage and combination of\ndata. Database platforms (for example SQL, Oracle, MySQL or\neven Microso  Access) have many bene ts over simple\nspreadsheets. The most important of these is the ease of linking\nand combining information from various sources into a single\ntable. Information on the materials used, catalyst synthesis,\nexperimental conditions, raw analytical data and calibration\ndata must all be combined into a single table that tells you what\nthe performance of each of the catalysts is at each experimental\ncondition.\nOnce the data set is constructed the initial visual exploration\nof the data can start. Here the total data set needs to be\nconsidered. Particular attention is needed for the identifying\noutliers. These must be studied, and where appropriate\nremoved prior to any model-based data analysis. In this stage it\nis also important to check the stability of process parameters\nlike temperature and pressure. Several commercial soware\npackages are available to facilitate the visual interpretation of\ndata (for example Spotre, Miner3D and Tableau). However,\nkeep in mind that interpreting plots mapping many dimensions\nis diﬃcult (Fig. 4, for example, was generated using Miner3D\nand is a typical multi-dimensional representation of data).\nWhen the initial exploration of the data set is complete,\nmodel-based evaluation can start. One of the most common\nmethods here is principal component analysis (PCA). PCA aims\nto reduce the number of dimensions of a data set whilst\npreserving as much as possible the variability. Using PCA, you\ncan extract the key factors. These are the principal components,\nor PCs (sometimes also called the latent variables). Each PC is a\nlinear combination of the original variables, but unlike the\noriginal variables, which may be correlated with each other, the\nPCs are orthogonal ( i.e., uncorrelated, independent of one\nanother, see Fig. 6).\nTo demonstrate the usefulness of PCA, we show the data and\nPCA analysis thereof for the selective hydrogenation of\n5-ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF).\n22,23 As with all a,b-unsaturated\naldehydes, the primary reaction products are an unsaturated\nalcohol and a saturated aldehyde. Both primary products\nundergo various sequential hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis\nreactions, resulting in a rather complex reaction network (see\nFig. 7) with eight products occurring in signicant amounts\n(>5% molar yield). In this case only two principal components\nare needed to explain 70% of the variation in the data. That\nmeans that interpreting the data for a large part can be done by\nlooking at a single two-dimensional plot of the PCs, which is an\neasier task than identifying trends in the original eight\nconversion-selectivity plots.\nPCA gives us in two pieces of information:rst, the loadings\n(P) tell us how the individual yields contribute to the structure of\n5966 | RSC Adv.,2 0 1 4 ,4, 5963–5974 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2014\nRSC Advances Review\nOpen Access Article.

From the loadings plot we can learn a number of\nthings (Fig. 7). First, we see that the loadings for all yields are\npositive in therst principal component (the horizontal axis in\nFig. 7)– this indicates that all yields go up in this direction. In\nother words PC1 primarily gives information about activity.\nWhen considering PC2 the loadings for the yields of3 and 8 are\nalmost at the same coordinate. This indicates that, no matter\nwhat changes are made to catalyst or conditions, the yields of\nFig. 4 Raw performance data for the oxidative coupling of methane over a Mn-promoted Na2WO4/SiO2 catalyst.

Since here we\nbase our PCA model on the yields, if two data points are close\ntogether in scores space they will have a similar product\ndistribution. In contrast, if they are far apart they will have a\nrather diﬀerent product composition. This is easily demon-\nstrated using the scores plot (Fig. 8). Here we see two distinct\nclusters. The cluster in the upper right quadrant corresponds to\na set of Pd/Al\n2O3 catalysts with various promoters tested at\ntemperatures of 100 and 120 /C14 C.

Descriptor –performance relationships for\nheterogeneous catalysis\nThe development of descriptor performance relationships for\nheterogeneous catalysts is hampered by the fact that the active\nsite of a heterogeneous complex is oen poorly dened. In\ncontrast, in homogeneous catalysis the entire catalyst is a well\ndened, molecular complex that can readily be described by\ncommon computational chemistry soware. This is reected in\nthe number of publications describing successful applications.\nFor homogeneous catalysis, the last 20 years yielded many\nFig. 6 PCA reduces the dimensionality of the problem by projecting\nthe original dataset onto a lower-dimension PC model, in which the\nnew variables are orthogonal to each other.

Alternatively, using\nsimple, readily accessible descriptors for the metals on the\ncatalyst surface can help us create descriptor –performance\nrelationships.\n3.3.1. An example – the selective hydrogenation of EMF.\nOne of the most important diﬀerences between heterogeneous\nand homogeneous catalysis in descriptor modelling is the\nmaturity of the available tools. In homogeneous catalysis, the\nlast two decades of research have resulted in many theoretical\ndescriptors. These range in complexity from simple atom and\ngroup counts to topological maps derived from graph theory to\ngeometrical descriptors of varying complexity. Open source and\ncommercial soware packages are readily available. In hetero-\ngeneous catalysis this is diﬀerent. Here available descriptors are\noen diﬃcult to obtain and are typically derived from DFT\nstudies or extensive characterization of the catalysts. These\nmethods, albeit of tremendous value for fundamental insights,\nare time consuming and require specialist knowledge. Catalyst\ncharacterization as a means to derive descriptors related to\nperformance poses another issue: onerst needs to synthesize a\ncatalyst, making“virtual screening” a challenging task.\n50\nUnderlying these challenges in heterogeneous catalysis is\nthe nature of the catalyst. In homogeneous catalysis, catalysts\nare typically well-dened molecular complexes. Heterogeneous\ncatalysis is much more complex, as the support and metals each\nplay multiple roles.\nOne practical approach, which we presented for assigning\ndescriptors for modelling heterogeneous catalysts, is using\nsimple bulk properties of the metals. We showed recently that\neven a complex reaction like the hydrogenation of EMF (reac-\ntion scheme in Fig. 7) can be described by correlation of bulk\nproperties of the metals used with the yields of the main\ncomponents.\n21 To simplify the problem, we kept the support\nmaterial and catalyst synthesis method used constant. This\nallows us to focus our eﬀorts in terms of descriptors on the\nmetals used alone. The descriptors we used were derived from\nSlater-type orbitals for the metals. Instead of using the entire\norbital function, we describe the curve be a number of peak\nparameters oen encountered in chromatography and spec-\ntroscopy. These simple parameters, the magnitude and location\nof the peak apex, the width at half height and the skewness, are\nsurprisingly well capable of correlating the metal used with the\nyields of the main products of the reaction. To establish the\nvalidity of the method werst explored a small data set for\nmonometallic catalysts (Fig. 9). A er establishing that this\nmodel performs well, we extended the data set to bimetallic\ncatalysts, again obtaining good model performance (Fig. 10).\nOne important characteristic of empirical modelling\nmethods needs to be emphasized here. Since there is no\nunderlying theoretical model describing the reaction, an\nempirical model will happily predict negative yields or conver-\nsions exceeding 100%. This means that such a model should\nalways be validated chemically and statistically. Luckily, most\nstatistical modelling methods provide this information as an\nintegrated part of the method. When using these methods to\ndesign a next set of catalysts for further testing a special situa-\ntion occurs. For any empirical model a simple rule of thumb is\nthat predictions can be made only over the range of data that\nwas used to create the model. In other words, if a model is\nregressed using data over a yield range of 0 to 70%, that model\nwill not be able to reliably predict yields great than 70%. Thus, if\nthe objective for a next set of catalysts is increasing the yield\nbeyond 70%, you need to extrapolate. In practice, each next set\nof catalysts will be based on predicted performance just outside\nthe current range of data. By retting the model aer each set of\nexperiments the valid yield range for the model is extended in\nan iterative manner.\n3.3.2. Developing new descriptors. In contrast to theeld\nof homogenous catalysis, the scientic literature documenting\nFig. 9 Matrix plot comparing observed yields (left) to the yields predicted by the OPLS model (right). The products are grouped in columns, the\ncatalysts and temperatures are grouped in rows. The yields are coded from light (low yield) to dark (high yield).

On the right hand side a parity plot representing the same information is given to facilitate interpretation\n[adapted from ref. 21, with permission].\nThis journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2014 RSC Adv.,2 0 1 4 ,4, 5963–5974 | 5969\nReview RSC Advances\nOpen Access Article.

Several groups\npublished successful examples of the application of DFT\nsimulations to describe reaction networks. Application of the\nd-band center as a descriptor is also referred to in many occa-\nsions. When turning our attention to simple, empirical\ndescriptors the number of references is even lower. On the basis\nof this less than abundant literature it is safe to assume that\nthere is a need for documented cases of descriptor develop-\nment. For these cases it would be important that not only their\napplication is documented, but also suﬃcient information is\nprovided to allow a researcher to use and extent the method in\ntheir own work. As an example, we present here the develop-\nment of descriptors related to adsorption of gases on metal\nsurfaces.\n24 Here we developed an empirical model to describe a\nlarge database of DFT computations, coupling the heats of\nchemisorption of 10 diﬀerent gases to simple, tabulated prop-\nerties of these gases and the 13 diﬀerent metals. Using this\ncorrelation (Fig. 11) between descriptors and computationally\nderived chemisorption data, we then extended the method to\nexperimental data of real catalysts. The models are suﬃciently\nrobust for application as a more general set of descriptors\n(Fig.12).\nThis empirical correlation that links easily obtained prop-\nerties to a phenomenon that is crucial to heterogeneous catal-\nysis, is valuable. Without extensive computations, one can\nquickly test a few ideas and get a feel for their viability, thus\nsaving the experiments for those ideas that have most merit. As\nwith any empirical model, one has to consider its range of\napplicability. Luckily, the modelling methods used to establish\nthese models provide an assessment of how valid a prediction\nis. Moreover, if a prediction is invalid, the same statistics can be\nused to design a set of experiments (or computations) that allow\nextension of the model in the desired direction.\nNote that the example shown is, indeed, just an example.\nMany diﬀerent types of descriptors are typically needed to\ndescribe a problem. This is true especially when the catalyst\nattributes associated with good performance are not well known\nupfront and have to be established experimentally. When\ndeveloping descriptors two guiding principles should be\nconsidered: (1) a set of descriptors should be accessible for most\n(preferably all) metals used in catalysis and (2) it should be\nsuﬃciently powerful in explaining catalyst performance on its\nown. Therst guideline is easily explained. Imagine using three\nblocks of descriptors, each having a limited set of metals to\nFig. 10 Observed vs. predicted plot for 48 bimetallic catalysts tested at\n3 temperatures for the combined yield of2 and 3.

The search space that can be\naddressed using these descriptors is limited to those metals\nthat can be captured by all three descriptor blocks. The second\nguideline is more complex. Since typically many di ﬀerent\nattributes need to be taken into account to explain catalyst\nperformance, the correlation with activity or selectivity of a\nsingle attribute is oen weak. In those cases, one needs to focus\non signicance of a correlation (or covariance) rather than its\nmagnitude. Luckily, in theeld of homogeneous catalysis these\nprocedures are tried and tested.\n3.4. Using descriptor models in catalyst discovery\nNow that we have a toolbox that provides the means of\ndesigning experiments, modelling the outcome thereof and\neven generating novel descriptors to meet our needs, we need to\nconsider how to apply these methods eﬀectively and eﬃciently.\nWe will demonstrate this on the selection of a subset of bime-\ntallic catalysts from a large set of candidates.\nFirst, we designate a set of metals as“Main metal” (high-\nlighted in blue in Fig. 13). Second, we designate a set of metals\nas “Dopant” (pink, in Fig. 13). These metals, or rather their\nbimetallic combinations, we characterize with the descriptors\nbased on Slater-type orbitals (see example on selective hydro-\ngenation and ref. 21). Please note that as many (or as few)\ndescriptors can be used as are required by the problem at hand.\nIf you know little about a problem, it is generally better to select\nmore descriptors to start with. Aer performing arst round of\nexperiments the redundant descriptors can be excluded based\non data rather than on assumptions. Finally, we select a number\nof supports (SiO\n2,A l2O3, TiO2, ZrO2,N b2O5, MgO and ZnO). For\neach of these supports we select a high and a low surface area.\nDue to the natural diﬀerence in practically accessible surface\nareas between diﬀerent supports, the surface area is treated in a\nrelative rather than an absolute manner. Besides surface area,\nthe supports are characterized using their point of zero charge.\nDopants were applied in molar ratios of 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2\nrelative to the main metal. Therst set of candidates consisted\nof all the combinations of one main metal and dopant at 3\nlevels, 13 /C2 16 /C2 3 ¼ 624 combinations. The second set was\ncomposed by combining two main metals at three dopant\nlevels, giving 13 /C2 12 /C2 3 ¼ 468. The total candidate set\ncontained therefore 624 + 468¼ 1092 bimetallic combinations.\nNote that this assumes the use of a single support and a single\nloading of the main metal. If support variations are included,\none could conceive using seven common supports, each with\nclassied by its isoelectric point. Were we to include surface\narea of this support, for example in a“high” and “low” fashion,\nthe number of supports available in the candidate set would\nincrease to 14. This increases the size of our candidate set to\n14 /C2 1092 ¼ 15 288. Here we assume that surface area, if\nimportant at all, will correlate with performance in a linear\nfashion (since we only use two levels, low and high, we only have\nenough degrees of freedom to explain the two coeﬃcients cor-\nresponding to a straight line). For metal loading, we will not\nmake this assumption. Instead, we will assume that the eﬀect of\nmetal loading is non-linear and we will use 3 levels. This\nincreases the size of the candidate set to 3/C2 15 288¼ 45 864\ncatalysts!\nSince we cannot synthesize and test over 45 000 catalysts, we\nmust take a stepwise approach. Assuming we can describe the\nproperties of the bimetallic combination by approximately 10\ndescriptors, we have ten metal parameters + two support\nparameters + one loading parameter¼ 13 variables that play a\nrole. As we do not know a priori whether the relationship\nbetween variables and performance is linear, we will assume it\nis nonlinear. Assuming a second order model, we need to\nidentify an intercept, 13 main eﬀects, 12 /C2 11 ¼ 132 two-vari-\nable interactions and 13 quadratic terms. This total of 157\nmodel coeﬃcients is the minimum number of degrees of\nfreedom we need to consider. Adding some replicates (or near\nneighbours) and some points to determine lack oft raises this\nto a number around 200 catalysts that would need to be\nsynthesized and tested. This is a number that is well within\nreach for most chemistries using state of the art parallel reactor\ntechnology. Note that this initial design only comprises 0.4% of\nthe original search space.\nTo eﬃciently select candidates from this search space, we\nrst reduce its dimensionality using PCA (see also the example\non selective hydrogenation). In this case, over 98% of the vari-\nance in the set of candidates is captured by six principal\ncomponents. Using experimental design (minimal point\ndesigns and distance based designs) we can select an optimal\nsubset of catalysts for arst round of experiments. Note that\nmachine-based selection methods are preferred over human\nintuition, to avoid any bias. Still, intuition not be ignored, so\nadding more candidates based on “gut feeling” is certainly\nrecommended.\nAs we explained above, a PCA model is characterized by two\nmatrices: the scores and the loadings. The loadings matrix gives\ninformation about the contribution of each of the original\nvariables to each of the principal components. Fig. 14 shows an\nexample using the loadings of the main eﬀects in therst four\nPCs of our model. We see that PC1 and PC2 mostly contain\ninformation about the metals used. This is clear from both the\nrelatively large size of the bars associated with“metal descrip-\ntors” as well as the absence of bars for“support descriptors”.I n\ncontrast, PC3 only contains information about the support\nused. The scores matrix, in combination with the selected\nFig. 13 Selected candidate space for our selection problem. Entries in\nblue are selected as main metals and entries in purple are selected as\ndopants.\nThis journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2014 RSC Adv.,2 0 1 4 ,4, 5963–5974 | 5971\nReview RSC Advances\nOpen Access Article.

As an example, Fig. 15 shows the\nscores on PC1 and PC2 for all data points, highlighting those\npoints selected by our algorithm. We see that this selection\ndescribes the problem well.\nNote that also the coverage (spread of points) in the other\nPCs should be evaluated before a decision is made to synthesize\nand test the selected catalysts. The irregular shape of the scores\nplot also demonstrates the need for non-classical design\nmethods. Regular experimental design methods are designed to\ndeal with regularly shaped (cubes, spheres, triangles) design\nspaces. When using this methodology, regularly shaped design\nspaces are an exception rather than a rule.\nThe last important concept to consider when using\nmachine-based selection is whether the selected catalysts can\nactually be synthesized in a meaningful and consistent\nmanner. A chemist will take this into considerationap r i o r i,\nb u tf o ral a r g es e to fc a n d i d a t e sl i k et h eo n ew ec o n s i d e rh e r e\nthis is not a trivial task. Instead of doing this upfront, we need\nto limit ourselves to carefully reviewing the catalysts once a\nselection is made. If some materials cannot be synthesized due\nto, for example, solubility limitations or incompatibility with\nthe support material, a suitable replacement needs to be\nidentied. A concept that can be used for this is similarity. If\nf o rs o m er e a s o nac a n d i d a t ec a talyst cannot be synthesized,\nthe “most similar” catalyst that does allow synthesis is selected\ninstead. “Most similar” in this case can be dened as the\nnearest neighbour of the catalyst that needs to be replaced in\ndescriptor or principal component space. The concept is\ndemonstrated graphically in Fig. 16, using the transition\nmetals as an example. For example, we see that Fe and Co are\nquite similar, but Ir and Ti are not.\n3.5. Extension to other classes of catalysts\nIn this work we largely focus on catalysts composed of metals or\nmetal oxides supported on oxide carriers. The methodology\nused however is quite generic in nature and is readily extended\nto other classes of catalysts. Of course, each class of catalysts\nwill have its own relevant subset of descriptors. Taking zeolites\nas an example, as arst pass one could consider using the Si–Al\nratio, the pore size and the number, density and type of the acid\nsites present. When metals are used, either exchanged or\nimpregnated, the descriptor set could be augmented with\ndescriptors as those presented here. In the case of metal –\norganic frameworks (MOFs), the descriptor list could include\nthe size and charge of the metal ions at the vertices, the\ndimensions and backboneexibility of the connecting organic\nspecies, and the possibility for binding at the surface and in the\npores (van der Waals forces, pi-stacking).\n51,52 For supported\nligand–metal complexes, the descriptors would include the\nstrength and length of the binding (graing) group to the\nsurface, the ligand bind angle and Tolman's cone angle, the size\nof the reaction pocket (which is oen correlated with the cone\nangle), and the concentration/dispersion of active sites on the\nsurface.\n53,54 But in all cases, the workows shown in Fig. 1 and\nFig. 14 Loadings for the main eﬀects (the raw variables) of our catalyst\nselection problem for theﬁrst four principal components of the PCA\nmodel.

Conclusions\nDiscovering and optimising solid catalysts is still largely an\nempirical business. But this process can be helped by using the\nright combination of experimental design, descriptor model-\nling, high-level modelling, and experimental feedback and\nvalidation. A successful optimisation workow is per denition\niterative, and should include all three capacities (statistical\ndesign, experimental testing capabilities, and descriptor\nmodelling and validation; see example in Fig. 17). Integrating\nthese capacities (and people!) in one team, and realising that\nmultiple iterations are needed, are the keys to success.\nFurthermore, since much of the research on solid catalysts is\ndone in industrial environment, budgeting for multiple itera-\ntions of experiments, modelling, and validation will help you\ncreate and manage realistic expectations.\nNotes and references\n1 S.
