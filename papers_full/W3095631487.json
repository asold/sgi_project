    "abstract": "Automated story generation is a popular and well-recognized task in the field of natural language processing. The emergence of pre-trained language models based on large Transformer architectures shows the great capability of text generation. However, language models are limited when the generation requires explicit clues within the context. In this research, we study how to combine knowledge graphs with language models, and build a creative story generation system named DICE. DICE uses external knowledge graphs to provide context clues and implicit knowledge to generate coherent and creative stories. The evaluation shows that our approach can effectively inject the knowledge from knowledge graphs into the stories automatically generated by the language model.",
