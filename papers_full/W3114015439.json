INTRODUCTION\nMagnetic devices have a multifarious scope of application.\nEspecially in the ﬁeld of power electronic applications,\nthe design of magnetic devices is a signiﬁcant factor with\nregard to the application’s characteristics such as volume\nor weight, efﬁciency and costs. An additional degree of\nfreedom is gained by using ﬂux interaction of differently\naligned magnetic ﬁelds in magnetic devices over the course of\ntheir design process. This enables an enormous improvement\npotential, especially regarding volume or weight reduction of\nthe device. An example of an improved DC inductor through\nﬂux interaction of oppositely aligned magnetic ﬁelds using a\npermanent magnet is given in [1].\nThe effects of ﬂux interaction of magnetic ﬁelds become\ncontrollable if the permanent magnet is moved towards a\ncurrent-carrying auxiliary winding, which is wound on or\nintroduced into the magnetic core. In this way, an additional\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Mohsin Jamil\n.\nmagnetic ﬁeld is generated that results in an additional mag-\nnetic ﬂux within the core. An additional oppositely aligned\nmagnetic ﬂux counters the main ﬂux or even cancel it out.\nOrthogonally aligned magnetic ﬁelds and ﬂuxes theoretically\ndo not affect each other, according to the superposition prin-\nciple. Nevertheless, they can be used to saturate parts of the\ncore, what inﬂuences the inductive behavior of the magnetic\ndevice, making it adjustable over either its full operation\nrange or parts thereof.\nAt the moment, the potential of the ﬂux interaction\nunder discussion is not yet clearly summarized. Furthermore,\nthe application of the effect is not, or only rudimentarily,\ndescribed in the literature. Especially with regards to the great\nimportance of power electronic systems in electrical energy\ndistribution and the necessity to use as many improvement\npossibilities as possible, especially in the ﬁeld of magnetic\ncomponents, the subject area of ﬂux interaction can contain\nvarious potentials.

It is structured as\nfollows. After the introductory chapter, a differentiation of\nthe possible superpositions of magnetic ﬁelds is made and\nexplained in detail in the second chapter ‘‘Systematization’’.\nFor this purpose, an extensive list of available literature was\ncompiled and discussed according to the systematization.\nThis chapter is intended to provide an easy introduction to\nthe subject area, even for readers from other ﬁelds. The\nthird chapter deals with the basic mathematical descriptions\nof the interactions of magnetic ﬁelds, introduces deﬁnitions\nand also deals with relevant assumptions that can be made\nfor simpliﬁcation. To verify the mathematical basics and to\nsimplify the presentation of basic relationships, results of\nnumerical simulations are presented and summarized in the\nfourth chapter. The ﬁfth chapter deals with test setups and\nmeasurement results of all three introduced classes of super-\nposition of magnetic ﬁelds. In the sixth chapter, potentials\nand further research questions are listed and discussed. All\nchapters contain a short summary at the end of the chapter.\nAdditionally, the seventh chapter concludes the manuscript\nwith a summary.\nII. SYSTEMATIZATION\nAccording to [2], there are three different methods of super-\nposing magnetic ﬁelds in inductors and transformers. They\ndiffer in terms of the auxiliary winding’s design, which is\neither wound on the magnetic core or introduced into it\nthrough drill holes. If the auxiliary winding is energized by\na current, the resulting additional magnetic ﬂux will saturate\nparts of the core. This has an effect on the core’s overall\nreluctance and leads to an adjustable inductance value and\na controllable reactance of the magnetic device. The three\ndifferent methods are presented below:\n• parallel biasing\n• mixed biasing\n• orthogonal biasing\nIt is important to mention that the allocation to one of the\nthree categories named above is based on the directions of\nthe magnetic ﬁelds in the main area of parts of the core\ne. g. its legs or yokes. Within the transition areas of the\nmagnetic core geometry, e. g. from the center leg to the yoke,\nthe alignment of the magnetic ﬁelds might deviate from the\nallocated category.\nA. PARALLEL BIASING\nThe usage of permanent magnets in inductors for power\nelectronic converters is investigated and discussed in [3].\nAs well as using a permanent magnet introduced into the\ncore, the inductance of a magnetic device can be changed\nby an additional auxiliary bias winding which is wound on\nFIGURE 1. Core section with main winding and additional auxiliary DC\nbias winding [2].\nthe core. The generated auxiliary magnetic ﬂux is parallel\nto the main ﬂux and either aligned in the same or opposite\ndirection. An example of parallel biasing of a magnetic core\nsection is shown in Fig. 1.\nThe usage of an auxiliary winding instead of a permanent\nmagnet has the advantage of an adjustable auxiliary current,\nwhich generates an adjustable auxiliary magnetic ﬂux within\nthe core material. The result is a controllable reluctance of\nthe magnetic core, which can be adapted to and, more impor-\ntantly, changed with the device’s operating point. Depend-\ning on the characteristic of the magnetic device, signiﬁcant\nreluctance changes could be reached with small auxiliary\ncurrents.\nFurthermore, permanent magnets run the risk of demag-\nnetizing, e. g. through heat or vibration. Especially the latter\nreason could be critical considering automotive applications.\nAlso an oppositely aligned high ﬂux pulse generated by high\ncurrent pulses in the main winding is critical because the\npermanent magnet can be magnetized in its opposite direc-\ntion. This case could occur e. g. in a fault situation of the\napplication. An additional auxiliary winding is not negatively\naffected by the abovementioned inﬂuences.\nAnother advantage can be a simpler and more cost-effective\nmanufacture of the magnetic device, especially, if the\nauxiliary winding replaces a permanent magnet based on\nrare-earth materials. However, a possible cost advantage does\nhighly depend on the speciﬁcation of the magnetic device, its\ncharacteristic and its manufacturing process.\nA disadvantage of using an additional auxiliary winding\ninstead of a permanent magnet is the coupling between main\nwinding and auxiliary winding. Especially if an alternating\n2358 VOLUME 9, 2021\nJ. Pfeifferet al.: Review of Flux Interaction of Differently Aligned Magnetic Fields in Inductors and Transformers\ncurrent is injected in the main winding, a current ripple in\nthe auxiliary bias winding can be induced. The current ripple\ncan lead to voltage drops over the auxiliary winding, what\nin turn affects the main winding. Filtering measures in both\nwindings are necessary to suppress unwanted AC ripples and\nensure faultless operation under biasing.\nA further disadvantage lies in the additional circuit which\nis needed to provide the required bias current ﬂowing through\nthe auxiliary winding. The implementation of the circuit\nreduces both power density and overall efﬁciency of the\napplication. Considering small magnetic devices, the place-\nment of the auxiliary winding can be problematic, as there\nis a very limited space on the core. A permanent magnet,\nhowever, can be introduced into the core without any inﬂu-\nence on the winding area. Further investigations are discussed\nin [3].\nMain winding and auxiliary winding have not necessarily\nto be placed on the same core section. If they are placed on,\ne. g., different limbs, the coupling and the induction between\nboth windings is reduced. The results are lower voltage\ndrops, hence less ﬁltering requirements are needed. However,\na reduced coupling leads to a weaker inﬂuence of the bias ﬂux\non the main ﬂux. This means that a higher auxiliary current is\nneeded to achieve the desired change of the magnetic device’s\nreluctance.\nA detailed review of variable inductors and transformers\nusing parallel biasing is given in [4].\nAlthough the fundamental principle and effects of ﬂux\ninteraction of oppositely aligned magnetic ﬁelds has been\nknown for a long time, [5] is one of the ﬁrst IEEE publica-\ntions, which makes parallel biasing a subject of discussion.\nIn this article, the ﬂux interaction method is used in a mag-\nnetic ampliﬁer for radio telephone transmission. An addi-\ntional auxiliary DC bias winding is wound on an AC inductor.\nThe DC bias is used to saturate parts of the core and thereby\ninﬂuence its permeability to reduce the inductance of the\ninductor to the value it would have if the coil included only\nair.\nAccording to [6], magnetic ampliﬁers, also known as trans-\nductors, were primarily used for long-range radio transmit-\nting stations during World War I and especially in the German\nmilitary equipment during World War II. After its end, sev-\neral investigations on transductors were made. Examples are\ngiven in [7]–[15]. A typical design of a magnetic ampliﬁer is\nshown in Fig. 2.\nReferences [7] and [8] deal with fundamental investiga-\ntions of magnetic ampliﬁers. Their basic operating principle\nand common circuits for their application are discussed and\nproved by measurements. Besides the conﬁgurations of EE,\nEI or U cores, toroidal cores are chosen in the design pro-\ncess, especially if high performance is paramount. Toroidal\ncores have some advantages regarding manufacturing. How-\never, they are unsuitable if air gaps within the core are\nessential.\nAnalytical calculation and modeling methods for trans-\nductor design with external and self feedback are presented\nFIGURE 2. A magnetic amplifier [7].\nin [9] and [10]. Using a feedback method reduces the needed\nauxiliary direct current to saturate the magnetic cores.\nA few application examples of magnetic ampliﬁers are\ngiven in [11]– [13] to illustrate their widespread use and\nsigniﬁcance towards comparable technologies, e. g. vacuum\ntube ampliﬁers.\nIn [14] and [15], control strategies for magnetic ampliﬁers\nare presented. An additional circuit is used to control the\nmagnetization curve.\nNowadays, magnetic ampliﬁers are almost completely\nreplaced by semiconductor devices. However, there are still\nsome application ﬁelds left where transductors are used\nbecause of their high robustness and reliability.\nSince the 1980s, parallel biasing is used for low-power\nhigh-frequency applications. One of the ﬁrst IEEE publica-\ntions for this area of application is given in [16]. In this\nconference paper, the ﬂux interaction method in conjunction\nwith investigations on air gap design is used to develop a\ncoupled-inductor Cuk converter.\nIn [17], an E core with a main AC winding on the center\nlimb and two auxiliary DC bias windings on the outer limbs is\nused to create a variable inductor for high-frequency resonant\nmode systems. The investigated prototype is designed around\ncommercially available cores. In contrast to transductors,\nthe auxiliary bias winding is usually wound on the outer legs\nof the magnetic core while the main winding is wound on the\ncenter limb.\nEspecially during the last decade, many investigations on\nparallel biasing were made, e. g. to reduce the size of the\nmagnetic core or to improve its geometry, as it is shown\nin [18] and [19]. References [20] and [21] present investiga-\ntions on magnetic ﬂux optimization in variable inductors. The\nauxiliary bias winding is not on the main EE core geometry\nbut applied on an additional E core, which is stacked under\nthe main core. The auxiliary bias current does not affect the\nwhole EE core but only its bottom yoke. Thereby, the cou-\npling between main winding and auxiliary bias winding and\nwith that operational asymmetries, which would lead to mag-\nnetic ﬂux interactions, are reduced or even canceled.\nVOLUME 9, 2021 2359\nJ. Pfeifferet al.: Review of Flux Interaction of Differently Aligned Magnetic Fields in Inductors and Transformers\nParallel biasing cannot only be used to create variable\ninductors. The principle is transferable to transformer appli-\ncations, as it is shown in [22].\nSeveral methods for calculation, analytical approximation\nand modeling of parallel biasing controlled magnetic devices\nare given in [23]–[34].\nReferences [23]–[27] deal with the analysis of electromag-\nnetic properties and the behavior of the core material as well\nas with a detailed loss calculation and ﬁnite element analysis.\nAnalyses of controllable magnetic devices using parallel\nbiasing in resonant tanks are presented and discussed in [28]\nand [29]. The theoretical work is proven by calculation and\nsimulation using MATLAB/SIMULINK or PSIM as well as\nby experimental results. Comparable investigations are made\nfor grid-tied converter applications in [30].\nA precise option to model and calculate magnetic devices\ncontrolled by parallel biasing is to simulate their electric\nor magnetic equivalent circuit. This approach leads to a\ndetailed understanding of the magnetic processes within the\ndevice. There are several suitable simulation software pro-\ngrams which can be used. A widespread standard is for\nequivalent circuit simulation is SPICE. In [31]–[34], several\nSPICE models for variable inductors in different applications\nare presented.\nConsidering parallel biasing in low-power high-frequency\napplications, a large ﬁeld of use includes circuits for lamp\nor LED supply and their control. Examples are given\nin [35]–[39]. The functional principle can be generalized to\nsimilar electronic ballasts, as it is presented in [40]–[44].\nAnother ﬁeld of application for controllable magnetic devices\ncovers resonant converters. Due to the adjustable inductance\nvalue of the inductor or transformer, the resonant tank can\nbe controlled with an additional variable besides the switch-\ning frequency. Therefore, it can be possible to reduce the\nfrequency range of the resonant converter or it might be\neven operable at constant frequency. Another possibility is\nto use the additional degree of freedom to reduce reactive\npower losses, if load conditions change.

However,\nparallel biasing can also be used in non-resonant converters.\nIn [52]–[58], several examples for different DC/DC converter\ntopologies using controllable inductors and transformers\nare presented. The objectives of the conducted investiga-\ntions usually are a substantial volume and weight reduc-\ntion of the magnetic device or a reduction of the switching\nlosses by achieving zero-voltage switching. A similar objec-\ntive for a AC/DC converter is presented in [59]. It has to\nbe considered that an additional current source is needed,\nif active parallel biasing is used. This leads to an additional\neffort regarding overall volume, weight and efﬁciency. Ref-\nerence [60] shows an investigation of using parallel bias-\ning for wireless power transfer in high-frequency resonant\ncircuits.\nA few of the investigated applications led to patents. Exam-\nples of patented controlled inductors are given in [61]–[63].\nFIGURE 3.

Several control\nstrategies and their implementation for different applications\nare presented in [64]–[70].\nB. MIXED BIASING\nAnother biasing method is mixed biasing. As it is shown\nin Fig. 3, the auxiliary bias winding is not wound on the\ncore but introduced into the core material through drill holes,\nwhich are orthogonal to the main ﬂux.\nThe generated auxiliary magnetic ﬁeld and its magnetic\nﬂux are either orthogonal or parallel to the main ﬂux depend-\ning on the position of the considered section around the drill\nhole. Regarding the parallelly aligned sections, the auxiliary\nbias ﬂux is either aligned in the same or opposite direction.\nTherefore, the auxiliary bias ﬂux enforces the main ﬂux on\nthe area where both ﬂow in equal direction and lowers it on\nthe area where they are differently aligned.\nIntroducing an auxiliary bias current into the core material\nhas the effect of saturating a small area around the drill holes\nwhich lowers the local permeability. This leads to a virtual air\ngap (V AG), whereby the overall core’s reluctance becomes\ncontrollable. The technique of V AG and the resulting virtual\nair gap variable reactor (V AG-VR) is investigated and dis-\ncussed in [71].\nRegarding the manufacturing process of the drill holes,\nthe mechanical properties of the core material have to\nbe considered. Manufacturing laminated iron cores for\nlow-frequency applications is different to ferrite or iron pow-\nder cores for high-frequency applications. Especially ferrite is\n2360 VOLUME 9, 2021\nJ. Pfeifferet al.: Review of Flux Interaction of Differently Aligned Magnetic Fields in Inductors and Transformers\ncritical because of its brittleness, which is similar to ceramics.\nTherefore, it is recommended to leave the drill process to be\nperformed by ferrite core manufactures or specialized com-\npanies what increases the cost of the magnetic core. Another\nmore cost-efﬁcient option might be to integrate the holes\nduring the pressing process of the ferrite core. The use of a\nmodiﬁed pressing tool might be proﬁtable if the number of\nmagnetic cores is high enough.\nIn comparison to transductors, V AG is a relative new\ntechnology. Reference [72] is one of the oldest IEEE pub-\nlications which has been presented close to the 2000s.\nIt contains useful information regarding the arrangement\nof the drill holes in principle to prevent magnetic ﬂuxes\nthrough the whole core. The conducted investigations were\ncontinued and expanded in [73]. Especially magnetic ﬂux\nand permeability simulations were made to explain the\nelectromagnetic processes within the core. Reference [74]\ndeals with the scaling of the V AG-VR to applications with\nhigher voltages and larger power. Similar investigations are\nmade in [75] with the difference that rectangular holes are\nused.\nCalculating the exact V AG length can be difﬁcult. Simula-\ntion programs using ﬁnite element method are able to support\nthe modeling of the magnetic device. Several publications\nwhich deals with the computation of V AG lengths in con-\ntrollable transformers are presented in [76]–[78]. Improved\ncomputing methods regarding accuracy and calculation speed\nare investigated in [79] and [80]. Reference [81] transmits\nthe V AG principle to toroidal cores. Simulations of the\nchanged main magnetic ﬂux are made to prove the calculation\nresults.\nDue to the short period of time where V AG is in\nuse, there are only a few publications presenting appli-\ncations for that special type of ﬂux interaction method.\nIn [82]–[84], it is used for microgrid tieline reconnection and\nfail safe operations. A prototype was designed and inves-\ntigated regarding principle functionality and power losses\nwithin the magnetic device. Reference [85] presents a voltage\ncontrol using a V AG-VR in a developed shunt compensation\nreactor. The design of the V AG-VR and its control strategy is\ndescribed in the article. Another application, which is given\nin [86], shows a coupled transformer with a V AG for dynamic\nvoltage restorers protection. The investigated design avoids\ndrill holes in the core material by using an extended core\ngeometry.\nIn spite of few scientiﬁc application publications, there\nexist several patents for magnetic devices using V AG which\ncover basic designs of the technology. Examples are given\nin [87]–[89]. Attention should be paid to the developed solu-\ntions regarding the manufacturing process of the magnetic\ndevices.\nSimilar to parallel biasing, a control structure for mixed\nbiasing is needed. A simple control strategy for a V AG-VR\nto achieve harmonic mitigation is presented in [90] and [91].\nIn both papers, a current modulation together with a full\nbridge DC/DC converter is used to adjust the control current.\nFIGURE 4. Core section with main winding and auxiliary DC bias winding\nintroduced to the core through drill holes parallel to the main flux [2].\nC. ORTHOGONAL BIASING\nFrom the mathematical point of view, the simplest superposi-\ntion method of differently aligned magnetic ﬁelds is orthogo-\nnal biasing. It can be described as a special form of V AG, as it\nis done in Fig. 4 to explain its mode of action. In contrast to\nmixed biasing, the auxiliary winding is introduced parallel to\nthe main ﬂux. The auxiliary magnetic ﬁeld and its occurring\nmagnetic ﬂux is always orthogonally aligned to the main\nﬂux.\nAccording to the superposition principle, both magnetic\nﬁelds and ﬂuxes should not affect each other. The coupling\nbetween both coils should theoretically be zero, whereby\nmathematical description and calculations become signiﬁ-\ncantly simpler. In practice, inﬂuences from one coil to the\nother can be observed. These effects are taken up and dis-\ncussed in Sec. V.\nUsing orthogonal biasing as a special form of V AG leads\nto the same challenges regarding manufacturing processes.\nFurthermore, it has to be checked if this ﬂux interaction\nmethod is suitable, especially for laminated iron cores in\nlower-frequency applications. If the generated auxiliary mag-\nnetic ﬂux has to pass the small air gaps between the single\niron sheets, the resulting air gap is usually too large, so that\northogonal biasing would not have any effect on the magnetic\ndevice.\nAlthough the manufacturing process is similar to V AG,\nthe observed effects on the magnetic device are different.\nBy using orthogonal biasing, other sections of the magnetic\ncore will be saturated in a different way than for parallel\nbiasing. That results in a varied curve progression of the dif-\nferential inductance value which leads to a modiﬁed behavior\nVOLUME 9, 2021 2361\nJ. Pfeifferet al.: Review of Flux Interaction of Differently Aligned Magnetic Fields in Inductors and Transformers\nFIGURE 5. A parametric transformer [93].\nof the magnetic device. Further discussions will be presented\nin Sec. IV and Sec. V.\nAnother signiﬁcant older way to generate orthogonal bias-\ning is the parametric transformer or paraformer. As it is shown\nin Fig. 5, the design consists of two wound U cores, one\nbeing turned at 90 degrees. It can be seen as a special form\nof a transformer with practically no mutual inductance and\nno coupling between the coils. The power transfer occurs\nthrough a variation of the magnetic device’s characteristics\nachieved by saturating the core material. The secondary side\nworks as a parametric oscillator. A detailed analysis of the\nparaformer is presented in [92].\nReferences [93]–[95] present the basic functional principle\nof parametric transformers and an analysis. Different con-\nstruction forms are investigated and discussed in [96]. Con-\nsidering this article, it can be seen that the design is allocated\nto orthogonal biasing. Even if the magnetic ﬂuxes within the\ntransition area of the two U cores are not exclusively orthog-\nonally aligned, the arrangement of both windings allows an\nallocation in this category. An improved structure using drill\nholes within the magnetic core is shown in [97]. A detailed\nﬂux analysis using ﬁnite element method to achieve a super-\nconducting controllable reactor is presented in [98].\nFor a better understanding and an easier calculation\nand design process, several publications regarding analy-\nsis, device characterization and parametric transformer mod-\nelling are given in [99]–[104]. An improved and more com-\nplex structure of the paraformer is introduced, investigated\nand discussed in [105] and [106].\nExamples for applications of the parametric transformers\nare given in [107]–[113]. In [107], the device is used to\nconnect two live busbars. Because of the device structure, it is\npossible to shift power from one bar to another one by adjust-\ning a phase shift angle between the two busbar voltages. The\nbehavior of the paraformer, when it is controlled by thyris-\ntors, is shown in [108]. References [109]–[112] present sev-\neral investigations around AC applications e. g. as a control\ndevice for electric motors or a power stabilizer. Further AC\napplications, can be a DC/AC converter using a parametric\ntransformer. Another improved paraformer design, the cross\ntransformer, is investigated and discussed in [113]. Several\napplication areas are presented in the article.\nFor all applications, control strategies for the parametric\ntransformer are essential which take its nonlinear characteris-\ntics into account. A fundamental analysis of the paraformer’s\ncontrol characteristic is shown in [114]. Reference [115]\npresents a complete and realizable control strategy using a\nbuck-boost DC/DC converter with a simple switch control\ncircuit.\nD. SUMMARY\nFlux interaction of differently aligned magnetic ﬁelds can be\nachieved either passively by introducing permanent magnets\ninto the core or actively by using an auxiliary bias current. The\nneeded current ﬂows through auxiliary bias windings which\nare wound on or introduced into the core material. The result-\ning auxiliary magnetic ﬁeld affects the core’s overall reluc-\ntance. The magnetic devices become controllable,thus gain-\ning an additional degree of freedom regarding the device’s\ndesign process.\nThere are three methods of ﬂux interaction of differently\naligned magnetic ﬁelds by using an auxiliary current:\nThe ﬁrst one is named parallel biasing. A second winding,\nwhich is wound on the core, generates an auxiliary magnetic\nﬂux that is aligned in the same or opposite direction and\nenforces or weakens the main ﬂux. The effect is similar to\nthe usage of a permanent magnet. This method is used for the\nmagnetic ampliﬁer and bias-controlled magnetic devices.\nThe second method is named mixed biasing. The auxiliary\ncurrent winding is introduced into the core through drill holes.\nThe resulting auxiliary magnetic ﬁeld is either orthogonal or\nparallel to the main ﬁeld. Thereby, core sections around the\ndrill holes saturate and behave like an air gap. The V AG-VR\nmakes use of this method.\nThe name of the third method is orthogonal biasing.\nThe auxiliary bias winding is aligned in such a way that its\nmagnetic ﬁeld is orthogonal to the main ﬁeld. This method\ncan be achieved using a special form of the V AG technique.\nAnother application is the parametric transformer.\nAn overview of the three biasing methods, their features\nand their applications is given in Tab. 1.\nTABLE 1. Overview of the biasing methods.\nIII. EXPLANATION AND MATHEMATICAL BACKGROUND\nA. GENERAL FLUX INTERACTION AND WHY IT OCCURS\nIt is commonly known that an inductance’s electrical behavior\nfollows u = ∂\n∂t (l(t) ·i(t)). While the secant inductance\n2362 VOLUME 9, 2021\nJ. Pfeifferet al.: Review of Flux Interaction of Differently Aligned Magnetic Fields in Inductors and Transformers\nl(t) = Nφ\ni as well as the differential inductance ld = dNφ\ndi\nis usually time-invariant, it can be affected by the induc-\ntance itself or by other components in the magnetic circuit if\nthey shift the point of operation to or within the material’s\nnonlinear area of operation, usually near saturation. Such\nother components in the same magnetic network are generally\nmagnetic sources, meaning current-carrying coils or perma-\nnent magnets. In order to derive an assembly’s quantitative\nbehavior, the magnetic core must be modeled as a magnetic\nnetwork, whose passive components and permanent magnets\nare solely determined by geometry, material and previous\nstate, and possesses the state variables magnetomotive force\n(MMF) f and ﬂux φ. The electrical state variables of any\nattached coils can then be expressed as:\nu =N dφ\ndt ; i =1\nN f (1)\nFluxes or MMFs created by different sources can generally\ninteract when sharing a common region in space of inter-\naction (RSI) within the magnetic core, where it is impor-\ntant to distinguish between (anti-)parallel, orthogonal and\nmixed interaction (see Sec. II). Any kind of (anti-)parallel\nﬂuxes can easily be represented within magnetic network\nmodels where several sources (e. g. coils or permanent mag-\nnets) can be arranged in series or in parallel, similar to\nthe network in Fig. 6. [116]– [117] give an overview of\nnonlinear network solutions. Reference [3] gives a review\nof such magnetic circuits’ terminal behavior and practical\napplications. Reference [92] shows how to derive the mag-\nnetic network from common parallel magnetization core\ngeometries.\nOrthogonal ﬂux interaction requires the deﬁnition of mag-\nnetic quadripoles. In theory, mixed ﬂux interaction may\nbe split into (anti-)parallel and orthogonal ﬂux interaction,\nthough practical applications may require more speciﬁc mod-\nels. Passive two-pole components’ behavior to link ﬂux and\nMMF is usually described as their reluctance Rm(φ) =f\nφ or\ndifferential reluctance Rm,d(φ) = df\ndφ or their characteristic\ncurve f (φ). These representations are generally equivalent,\nthough for practical reasons, only the characteristic curve\nwill be used in the following. A quadripole can be regarded\nas two two-terminal networks whose states affect the other\ntwo-terminal network’s characteristic.\nBecause there are other, more intuitive phenomena affect-\ning a two-terminal network’s reluctance, these are sometimes\nchosen to illustrate the effects of orthogonal magnetization.\nAssuming a homogeneous ﬂux density, a region of the area\nA, the length l and the permeability µ gives a reluctance\nRm = l\nµA . Therefore, a change in reluctance can be viewed\nas an according variation of geometry and permeability, e. g.\nin the V AG principle. However, the focus of this section\nwas on literal description and no analogies. Any kind of\n(anti-)parallel ﬂuxes can easily be represented within mag-\nnetic network models where several sources (e. g. coils or\npermanent magnets) can be arranged in series or in paral-\nlel, similar to the network in Fig. 6. [116]–[117] give an\nFIGURE 6. Magnetic networks with components representing ideal\nparallel and orthogonal magnetization.

Reference [3] gives\na review of such magnetic circuits terminal behavior and\npractical applications. Reference [92] shows how to derive\nthe magnetic network from common parallel magnetization\ncore geometries.\nB. INTRINSIC INTERACTION\nTwo magnetic ﬁelds within the same RSI may not follow\nthe principle of superposition but may react in a certain\nmanner, as indicated above. The following shall investigate\ninto appropriate representations of these interactions. It is\nworth noticing that ﬂuxes shall be categorized into parallel\nand orthogonal. Other conﬁgurations must be split up into\nthese components.\nParallel ﬂux interaction follows two simple rules depend-\ning on whether the ﬂuxes (parallel sources) or the MMFs\n(serial sources) add up\nf (φ1,φ2) =f (φ1 +φ2)\nφ(f1,f2) =φ(f1 +f2), (2)\nwhere the material’s magnetization curve h(b) respectively\nb(h) as well as the geometry (A and l) ought to be known\nin order to deﬁne the component’s characteristic curve:\nf (φ) =h\n(φ\nA\n)\n·l (3)\nAntiparallel ﬂuxes divert from this only with a change of sign,\nso their difference rather than their sum determines the mate-\nrial’s point of operation. Still, there are a few assumptions to\nbe made for (2) to apply:\n1) Coupling between sources (coils, permanent magnets)\nand the core does not depend on total MMF or ﬂux.\n2) Coupling between sources and the core is equal for each\nsource.\n3) The ﬂuxes are perfectly (anti-)parallel within the RSI.\n4) Further ﬂux interaction somewhere else (e. g. orthogo-\nnal) is represented separately.\nVOLUME 9, 2021 2363\nJ. Pfeifferet al.: Review of Flux Interaction of Differently Aligned Magnetic Fields in Inductors and Transformers\nFigure 6 includes two sources in series causing parallel ﬂux\ninteraction, one coil and one permanent magnet.\nOrthogonal interaction requires a more complicated\ndescription. Figure 10a gives an idea of how orthogonal\nﬂuxes may be achieved. There are numerous assumptions\nmade in the currently available models:\n1) The magnetic material is isotropic, hence a scalar mag-\nnetization curve b(h) exists.\n2) The magnetization curve is nonlinear.\n3) The magnetization curve increases monotonically,\ntherefore network solutions are distinct and the inverse\nmagnetization curve h(b) exists as a function, too.\n4) The magnetization curve goes through the origin.\n5) The magnetization curve does not change under any\ninﬂuences, e. g. frequency.\n6) The material causes no power losses (no eddy currents,\nno hysteresis loop).\n7) The RSI contains a homogeneous material.\n8) The RSI can be properly deﬁned and described.\n9) The magnetic ﬂuxes are homogeneous within the RSI.\n10) The RSI does not change under any inﬂuences, e. g.\nfrequency, magnitude.\n11) The magnetic ﬂuxes are perfectly orthogonal within the\nRSI.\n12) The resulting ﬁeld’s form is entirely independent from\nits magnitude.\n13) The interacting ﬂuxes do not interact anywhere else\nOR interaction elsewhere is modeled separately and\ncompatibly.\n14) There is no stray ﬁeld.\nHowever, following these assumptions, it becomes apparent\nthat ﬂux density over ﬁeld strength can easily be calculated\nas\nB(H1,H2) =B(H1e1 +H2e2)\n=B(\n√\nH2\n1 +H2\n2 ) · H√\nH2\n1 +H2\n2\n, (4)\nwhere\nB =\n(B1\nB2\n)\n; H =\n(H1\nH2\n)\n;e1 ⊥e2 (5)\nand where the magnetization curve B(H) and its inverse\nfunction H(B) need to satisfy assumptions 1 – 7. Fig-\nure 7 illustrates the construction of the ﬂux density B\nfrom two given orthogonal ﬁeld strengths H1 and H2\nin comparison to the use of the inadequate superposition\nprinciple and Fig. 8 shows the difference of the results\nof the latter principle compared to the results of correct\nconstruction.\nEquation 4 is equally valid to describe H(B1,B2). While\nthe superposition principle assumes no interaction, the behav-\nior described in (4) generates a double frequency ﬂux density\nchange as described in Fig. 9.\nTo derive the magnetic component’s characteristic curves\nf1(φ1,φ2) and f2(φ1,φ2) for the non-trivial case that the\nFIGURE 7. Two given orthogonal field strengthsH1 and H2 with larger\nand falsely oriented resulting flux, assuming no interaction\nBfalse = B(H1)e1 + B(H2)e2 than actually resulting fluxBres according\nto (4) [92].\northogonal ﬁeld is non-zero, the RSI’s geometry must be\ntaken into account. The concerning assumptions 10 – 13 can\nonly be achieved with a torus-shaped core (see Fig. 10b),\nthough an analytical solution may be impracticably complex\naccording to [92] and numerical approximations of sorts may\nbe required. Assumptions 8 – 9 can be achieved by a very thin\ntorus, whose effective areas and lengths can be deﬁned as A1,\nl1, A2 and l2.\nThe characteristic function\nfk(φ1,φ2) = lk\nAk\nφk ·\nh\n(√\nφ2\n1\nA2\n1\n+φ2\n2\nA2\n2\n)√\nφ2\n1\nA2\n1\n+φ2\n2\nA2\n2\n∀k ∈{1;2} (6)\nthen describes the magnetic component perfectly [92].\nOf course, the above deﬁnitions of reluctance and differential\nreluctance are applicable to this relation.\nFinally, assumption 14 ensures that the magnetic ﬂuxes\nactually ﬂow through the regarded RSI which is generally\ntrue for a proper core design. However, at points of oper-\nation far into the material’s saturation, this becomes less\napplicable.\nDeviations from the ideal theory appear in real setups.\nDespite a decent application design, the following errors may\nappear and void the above theory:\n1) The core material is nonisotropic, causes losses and\ndepends on frequency and possibly other inﬂuences.\n2) Mixed interaction may be difﬁcult to properly split up\nanalytically.\n3) Most orthogonal interaction cores show parallel mag-\nnetization somewhere else in the core [92].\n4) Often no separate paths for both orthogonal ﬂuxes,\ntherefore interaction in different regions and no perfect\northogonality [92].\n5) Flux densitities are not homogeneous.\n6) Field’s form depends on ﬂux magnitude.\n7) RSI depends on ﬂux magnitude.\n8) Generally no properly deﬁnable RSI.\n2364 VOLUME 9, 2021\nJ.

There\nis currently no fundamental theory on the quantitative behav-\nior of real orthogonal or mixed magnetization applications.\nThere is currently no approach on how to separate mixed\nmagnetization into parallel and orthogonal, so further theory\nis needed before applying the above models for intrinsic\nFIGURE 9.

The difﬁculty arises from the very inhomoge-\nneous and magnitude-dependent distribution of the ﬁeld’s\ndirection vectors due to the non-linear material, so that the\nmagnetic ﬁeld’s form (directions and relative magnitudes) are\nextremely difﬁcult to calculate with conventional methods.\nHowever, [118] shows clearly, that numerical calculation\n(FDM, FEM) can serve properly to apply the intrinsic inter-\naction model to any geometry.\nAs already mentioned in [92], applications relying on\northogonal ﬂux interaction must not have parallel ﬂux in\nany regions within the core. At the same time, geome-\ntries as in Fig. 10 are difﬁcult to manufacture and may be\nresource-intensive.\nFig. 21 and Fig. 22 demonstrate that deviations 5 – 8 occur\neven before applying an orthogonal ﬂux, especially at oper-\nating points deep into saturation.\nC. ELECTRIC TERMINAL BEHAVIOR\nGiven the interaction between two ﬂuxes (split up into\nan (anti-)parallel and an orthogonal part) by (2) and (6),\nthe terminal behavior of typical magnetic applications can\nbe derived by applying the above relations between magnetic\nand electric network entities.\nVOLUME 9, 2021 2365\nJ. Pfeifferet al.: Review of Flux Interaction of Differently Aligned Magnetic Fields in Inductors and Transformers\nFIGURE 11. Quantitative example for electric terminal behavior of a\nparallelly influenced inductance.L(I) curve shifted alongI axis with\npermanent magnets [3].\nIt is important to notice, that other than electric networks,\nwhose change in state merely result in a change of the cur-\nrent power ﬂow, magnetic networks’ changes of state result\nin a change of energy distribution due to the time-integral\nnature of the magnetic ﬂux 8 = 1\nN\n∫\nu d t. Therefore, all\nﬂux interaction can be used to transport energy, possibly\nbetween two current-carrying coils. This principle is used\nin transformers which are based parallel magnetization and\nin paraformers, based on orthogonal ﬂux interaction. There\nis precise analytical theory available to determine the sta-\nbility and point of operation of electric networks involving\nan orthogonal interaction magnetic circuit and at least one\ncapacitor. Reference [92] gives an overview over the applied\nMathieu and Hill equations for real paraformers, which shall\nnot be discussed in this article any further.\nParallel and anti-parallel magnetization with a permanent\nmagnet providing a constant MMF fpre simply shifts the L(I)\ncurve along the I-axis about 1\nN fpre. Both terms add up for\nparallel ﬂuxes and subtract for anti-parallel ones:\nL(I,fpre) =L\n(\nI ±1\nN fpre\n)\n(7)\nFig. 11 illustrates the result. It should be mentioned, that a\nnonlinear parallel magnetic source will distort the L(I) curve.\nOrthogonal ﬂux interaction has already been investigated\nabove and the magnetic network entities in (6) can be con-\nverted into the electric terminal entities as already mentioned\nbefore. However, this conversion results in a more com-\nplicated behavior than with parallel magnetization. Fig. 12\nshows an example of an orthogonal interaction magnetization\ncurve and the according L(I) curve with L :=1\nI\n∫\nu d t.\nD. SUMMARY\nIt could be shown that, with the help of various suitable\nassumptions, a calculation of ﬂux interactions is analyti-\ncally possible. The investigations were related to the current\nview of magnetic circuits using selected literature. They thus\nprovide the basis for understanding simulations and measure-\nments and help to interpret these results accordingly. Of par-\nticular importance in the chosen approach are the extensive\nassumptions. In future investigations, the listed assumptions\nFIGURE 12. Qualitative example for electric terminal behavior of an\northogonally influenced inductance according to (6).\nshould be analysed in detail to further detail the analytical\nmodelling.\nIV. SIMULATION RESULTS\nTo get a deeper understanding of the processes within the\nmagnetic core during a ﬂux interaction of differently aligned\nmagnetic ﬁelds, 2D and 3D simulation are a suitable methods\nto illustrate, e. g., the saturation level of the different core\nareas. The following section provides an overview of various\nsimulation results of the different biasing methods introduced\nin Sec. II using the software FEMM and Ansys Maxwell.\nThe simulations were carried out for different core mate-\nrials because the manufacturer could only provide these\nspecial combinations of machined core materials and core\ngeometries.\nA. PARALLEL BIASING\nTo show the impact of parallel biasing, a magnetic ampliﬁer is\nsimulated using FEMM. The main winding is located on the\ncenter leg and is wound counterclockwise, whereas the two\n2366 VOLUME 9, 2021\nJ.

Simulation results of a magnetic amplifier withIaux = 1 A.\nauxiliary windings are located on the two outer legs. The left\nwinding is also wound counterclockwise, the right winding\nis wound clockwise. For simulation, an E70/33/32 core made\nof ‘‘N87 material’’ (EPCOS/TDK) is used.\nIn Fig. 13, the auxiliary bias current is Iaux =0 A. The\nmain magnetic ﬂux is evenly distributed to the two outer\nlegs. The saturation of the core is at a medium level. The\nauxiliary bias current is increased to Iaux =1 A in Fig. 14.\nThe auxiliary magnetic ﬂux within the left leg is oppositely\naligned to the main magnetic ﬂux, while the auxiliary mag-\nnetic ﬂux within the right leg is aligned in the same direction.\nThe overall magnetic ﬂux and its density within the left leg\ndecrease, while they increase within the right leg.\nIf the direction of the auxiliary bias current changes, the left\nleg will show a higher ﬂux density, whereas the right leg will\nbe stressed to a lesser extent. The resulting auxiliary current\nwill affect all outer legs as well as the yokes, only the center\nleg will remain unaffected.\nB. MIXED BIASING\nAccording to section II an application of mixed biasing is a\nV AG-VR. Figures 15 – 17 show a V AG-VR that was used\nfor veriﬁcation measurements in [119]. It is an E34/14/9 core\nmade of ‘‘3C90 material’’ (Ferroxcube), which is simulated\nusing Ansys Maxwell. The air gap is 1 mm. To introduce\nthe auxiliary bias winding into the core, four holes with a\nFIGURE 15. Simulation results of a mixed biased ferrite E-core with\nIaux = 0 A [119].\nFIGURE 16.

The ﬂux density is still low\nin the yokes as well as in the center leg and the outer\nlegs.\nBy increasing the auxiliary current to Iaux =20 A (Fig. 16),\nsimulation results show a signiﬁcant saturation in the upper\nand lower yoke within the area around the drill holes. The\nVOLUME 9, 2021 2367\nJ. Pfeifferet al.: Review of Flux Interaction of Differently Aligned Magnetic Fields in Inductors and Transformers\nFIGURE 18.

The saturation\ndoes not change, especially close to the air gap.\nAt an auxiliary current of Iaux =40 A (Fig. 17), the satu-\nration spreads within the yoke and affects the passages to the\nlegs. The middle section of the legs is still unaffected.\nThe permeability of the saturated core material decreases\nsigniﬁcantly. The whole saturated area behaves like an air\ngap, what leads to an adjustable and controllable reluctance\nof the magnetic core. If the drill holes are introduced into the\ncenter leg or the outer leg, these sections will saturate while\nthe yokes and the unmachined leg/s are unaffected.\nC. ORTHOGONAL BIASING\nIf the core material is isotropic, the V AG concept can be used\nas orthogonal biasing. The core in Fig. 18–20 is also used\nfor veriﬁcation measurements in [119]. It is an P30/19 core\nmade of ‘‘3C90 material’’ (Ferroxcube), which is simulated\nusing Ansys Maxwell. The air gap is 0.14 mm. The P core\nalready has a hole within the center leg, so drilling is not nec-\nessary. As well as the investigations regarding mixed biasing,\nthe auxiliary bias current is increased from Iaux =0 A up to\nIaux =40 A.\nIf no auxiliary current ﬂows (I aux = 0 A), the middle\nsection of the center leg shows a high ﬂux density whereas\nthe ﬂux density, in the outer ring leg is low (Fig. 18).\nFIGURE 20. Simulation results of a orthogonal biased ferrite P-core with\nIaux = 40 A [119].\nBy increasing the auxiliary current to Iaux =20 A (Fig. 16),\nsimulation results show a signiﬁcant saturation in the center\nleg. Even the outer ring leg is affected.\nIn Fig. 17, the auxiliary current is increased up to Iaux =\n40 A. The saturation spreads from the center leg to the outside\nuntil almost the whole core is saturated.\nIf the whole core saturates, the magnetic device’s behavior\nis close to an air coil. The inductance value is at its minimum\nand cannot decrease anymore.\nD. LACKING HOMOGENEITY\nFig. 21 proposes a possible section of a magnetic core\nintended to show orthogonal ﬂux interaction between some\nvertically and horizontally oriented ﬂux. While Fig. 21a\nshows the vertical ﬂux’s distribution within the RSI and the\nsurrounding area (vertical arms and air), Fig. 21b demon-\nstrates how the horizontal arms affect the vertical ﬂux, even\nwith absolutely no source on the horizontal circuit. It should\nbe mentioned that Fig. 21 shows a point of operation deep into\nthe material’s saturation. More than half of the ﬂux escapes\nthe intended RSI.\nIt might appear intuitive to try and prevent this phe-\nnomenon by using isotropic materials or isotropic geome-\ntry. Figure 22 demonstrates the use of longitudinal air gaps\n(LAGs) in the cross’s arms, where they are in parallel to\nthe wanted and orthogonal to the unwanted ﬂux. Of course,\nthey end right before the RSI. Unfortunately, this measure\nmakes only little difference with regards to properly deﬁned\nﬂux distribution. Instead, ﬂux now escapes the RSI deep\nin the horizontal arms causing parallel, antiparallel, mixed\nand orthogonal magnetization outside the RSI in a poorly\npredictable and describable way.\nDespite the abovementioned ineffective attempts to obtain\nhomogeneous ﬂux density, there is a promising core geome-\ntry: By bending a ﬂat and rectangular piece of magnetic core\ninto a pipe, the tangential ﬂux never leaves the RSI because\nthere is no further magnetic circuit required. If the pipe is\nbent into a thin, hollow torus (see Fig. 10b), both ﬂux dis-\ntributions are perfectly perpendicular towards each other in\neach point within the torus and no further magnetic material\n2368 VOLUME 9, 2021\nJ.

DISCUSSION OF SIMULATIONS\nSimulation results are a signiﬁcant help in research and devel-\nopment. They enable a deeper understanding of the physical\nprocesses within the core material and support the design and\nevaluation process.\nHowever, it should be considered that the simula-\ntions’ accuracy is highly dependent on the used parame-\nters and boundary conditions. The simulation results can\njust be as reliable as the mathematical model behind the\nsoftware.\nMost simulation software programs are very precise for\nspeciﬁc applications. In divergent cases, they might be unsuit-\nable. Furthermore, the data input is very important to achieve\na high precision. Many simulation software programs are able\nto read hole hysteresis data of the used material. This is highly\nrecommended to achieve a high accuracy.\nFor the executed simulations in Ansys Maxwell and\nFEMM magnetization curves based on the data sheets of\nthe ferrites were used. The boundary conditions were set\nto default as recommended by the software manufacturers.\nIn Ansys Maxwell, the mesh conditions were increased com-\npared to the suggested settings to avoid further iterations and\ndue to sufﬁcient simulation time. A veriﬁcation was done\nregarding the sufﬁcient meshing and boundary conditions for\nthe modeling.\nF. SUMMARY\nThe simulation results have shown how the three ﬂux interac-\ntion methods affects the core material. While parallel biasing\nusually affects the whole core, mixed biasing just affect an\narea around the drill holes. Other sections of the magnetic\ncore, which are further away, stay unaffected. If orthogo-\nnal biasing is used, the saturation spreads from the cen-\nter to the outside and is able to affect the whole core\ngeometry.\nFurthermore, it has to be said, that suitable and precise\nsimulation conditions are essential to get accurate simulation\nresults.\nA cross-shaped structure was introduced for further inves-\ntigations and adjustments of this structure were also dis-\ncussed. This structure will be used, similar to a single sheet\ntester, in future investigations, especially to be able to adjust\nand improve the analytical model with simpliﬁed simulated\nresults and measurements.\nV. MEASUREMENT RESULTS\nIn this section, measurement results for the different methods\nof ﬁeld superposition based on different setups are presented\nand explained. The focus is on E cores, because all variants\ncan be realized very well with these cores. Small-signal\nmeasurements with impedance meters and large-signal mea-\nsurements for evaluation of the hysteresis and magnetization\ncurves are performed. For the small-signal measurements,\nthe Precision Magnetics Analyzer 3260B from Wayne Kerr\nand the Impedance Analyzer Bode 100 from Omicron Lab are\nused. A sine voltage of small amplitude is applied to the DUT\nby the measuring device and the subsequent current and phase\nshift are measured. This allows the impedance calculation of\nthe DUT and, based on this, further characteristics such as a\nseries inductance and a series resistance. The measurement\nis carried out at a sine wave voltage with Urms =1 V and\nany frequency (frequency sweep). For large-signal measure-\nments, a ﬁxed frequency is selected, while the voltage can be\nadjusted variably. Different voltages allow variable control\nof the component, which is crucial due to the nonlinear\neffects. The size of the ﬂux linkage 9 can be measured via\nan integrating low-pass ﬁlter. By additionally measuring the\ncurrent, a hysteresis curve (9 (I)-curve) can be generated on\nthe oscilloscope. A frequency of 250 Hz is selected for these\nmeasurements. This frequency is not in the high-frequency\nrange, although this is the application range of ferrites. The\nreason is, that due to the relatively large inductance of about\n3 mH, a very large voltage would be required to drive the core\nor even parts of it into saturation.\nAs with the simulations, the measurements were carried\nout for different core materials because the manufacturer\ncould only provide these special combinations of machined\ncore materials and core geometries.\nVOLUME 9, 2021 2369\nJ. Pfeifferet al.: Review of Flux Interaction of Differently Aligned Magnetic Fields in Inductors and Transformers\nFIGURE 23. DUT for parallel biasing.\nFIGURE 24. Winding connection at the DUT for parallel biasing (Test 1).\nA. PARALLEL BIASING\nThe parallel bias appears quite trivial, but large-signal mea-\nsurements produce very unusual hysteresis curves. An MnZn\nE core (E70/33/32) is used for the measurements (see\nFig. 23). This core has windings on the middle leg (blue\nwinding) and outer legs (red windings). The yellow winding\nis not interesting for parallel premagnetization and the green\nand white windings are used for measuring.\nFor a ﬁrst measurement, an alternating current is impressed\non the winding of the middle leg and the measurement is\ncarried out on a second winding on this leg. The auxiliary\ncurrent IAux is impressed on the windings of the outer leg\n(see Fig. 24). The generated DC magnetic ﬁeld in the middle\nleg, is either in the opposite or in the same direction as the\nalternating ﬁeld, depending on the sign of the alternating\ncurrent.\nThe DC magnetic ﬁeld creates a new operating point\non the magnetization characteristic line. If this operating\npoint is placed close to the saturation range, strong deforma-\ntions of the hysteresis curve occur (see Fig. 25). Since the\nFIGURE 25. Hysteresis-curves at parallel biasing (Test 1).\nmeasurement was made with a low-pass ﬁlter, the shift\ninto the operating point is not visible. Only the deforma-\ntion of the hysteresis curve can be reproduced. Furthermore,\nthe hysteresis curve is not fully modulated to avoid high\nsaturation currents when the operating point is shifted. The\npeak-to-peak value of the input voltage was not changed\nduring the measurements.\nAs the auxiliary current increases, the operating point is\nmoved further and further into the saturation range. A sig-\nniﬁcant change in inductance becomes visible. However,\nit should be emphasized that all commutation points lie on\nthe same commutation characteristic curve. With this type of\npremagnetization, therefore, the nonlinear properties of the\nmagnetization characteristic curve are exploited to a large\nextent. A completely different behavior can be observed\nwith parallel premagnetization due to a modiﬁed wiring of\nthe windings on the outer leg and the measurement of the\nhysteresis curve on the outer legs. The auxiliary current for\npremagnetization is now fed into the winding on the middle\nleg. The alternating current is accordingly generated by the\nwindings on the outer leg.\n2370 VOLUME 9, 2021\nJ. Pfeifferet al.: Review of Flux Interaction of Differently Aligned Magnetic Fields in Inductors and Transformers\nFIGURE 26. Winding connection at the DUT for parallel biasing (Test 2).\nFIGURE 27. Hysteresis-curves at parallel biasing (Test 2).\nDue to the wiring shown in Fig. 26, the alternating ﬂow\nin the middle leg of the core is cancelled. The connection of\nthe measuring winding on the outer leg is done in the same\nway. The bias ﬂux generated by the auxiliary current is in one\nouter leg in the same direction as the alternating ﬂux, while\nthe alternating ﬂux is in the opposite direction in the second\nouter leg.\nDue to the special circuitry, the hysteresis curve is\ndeformed at high auxiliary currents in such a way that a\ndouble S curve is created (see Fig. 27).\nB. MIXED BIASING\nIn the following, the measurement results of the mixed pre-\nmagnetization are presented and explained. The same E core\n(E70/33/32) (see Fig. 28) is used as in the measurements for\nmixed premagnetization. In this core, twelve holes are drilled\nhorizontally through the middle leg. A wire (yellow) is passed\nthrough the holes in such a way that directly adjacent wires\ncarry the direct current Iaux in opposite direction.\nThe measurements are carried out on the white winding on\nthe middle leg. In addition, a direct current can feed into on\nthe blue winding on the middle leg in order to set an operating\npoint on the magnetization characteristic curve.\nThe result of the mixed premagnetization is again a double\nS curve with a kind of Rayleigh loop around the zero point as\nit is shown in Fig. 29. For an auxiliary current Iaux =2 A,\nthe hysteresis curve is deformed rather than resembling a\ndouble S curve. Only for currents that increase in magnitude,\nthe described shape becomes clearly visible. The effect can\neasier been seen by calculating the magnetization curves\n(see Fig. 30). To describe the behavior, the following simple\ntransformer with UI core is considered (see Fig. 31) [120].\nThe part in the winding window of the transformer is designed\nas a controllable unit [120].\nThe tangent hyperbolic function can be used to approxi-\nmate the magnetization characteristic of a magnetic section.\nFor the structure that ensues, the following relationship\nresults for the magnetization characteristic curve of the con-\ntrollable unit in the center of the core:\n81(F1) =Bsat ·Aeff\n·\n(\ntanh\n(µ0 ·µr ·(F1 +N ·Iaux)\nBsat ·leff\n)\n+tanh\n(µ0 ·µr ·(F1−N ·Iaux)\nBsat ·leff\n))\n(8)\nAeff is the area of the center UI core in Fig. 31. leff is the\nlength from the middle of the center UI core’s upper yoke to\nits lower yoke. The result is shown in Fig. 32. It is again a\ndouble S curve, for an increase in direct currents Iaux and for\na ﬁctitious core.\nIf only two adjacent holes of the original structure (as\nshown in Fig. 33) are considered, a similar relationship to\nFig. 31 can be identiﬁed.\nThe main ﬂow is on the two outer sides of the leg, in the\nopposite direction to the ﬂow generated by the auxiliary cur-\nrent, and in the middle, it is in the same direction. In addition,\nthe area in the middle is approximately twice as large as\nthe area on the outside of the leg. However, problems in the\ncalculation are caused by those parts that are not parallel\nor antiparallel to the main ﬂow. This is one of the main\nreasons why the measured characteristic curve differs from\nthe theoretical characteristic curve of the simple replica, but\nalso from the previously measured characteristic curve with\na purely parallel premagnetization. In Fig. 34 and Fig. 35,\nthe small-signal measurements for the core are now shown.\nThe percentage change of the series inductance at a set current\nIaux, y is given, in each case related to the inductance at the\nfrequency fz and a current Iaux =0 A. In addition, the set\ncurrent in the main winding I1, x must be considered.\n1L =L(I1,Iaux,fz) −L(I1,Iaux =0,fz)\nL(I1,Iaux =0,fz) (9)\nThe main current I1 adjusts the operating point on the\nmagnetization curve during the small-signal measurement\nand the current Iaux changes the shape of the hysteresis curve,\nas shown by the large-signal measurement. The dependence\non the frequency is caused by the permeability on the one\nhand and by parasitic effects of the test setup as well as the\ntest object on the other hand.\nBy increasing the current Iaux, the inductance can be sig-\nniﬁcantly reduced. The reason is that the magnetization char-\nacteristics at the zero point I1 =0 A are sheared signiﬁcantly\nVOLUME 9, 2021 2371\nJ.

Hysteresis curves at mixed biasing.\nFIGURE 30. Magnetisation curves at mixed biasing.\nand therefore have a much smaller slope. This can be change\ndepending on the operation point. With a main current\nI1 =1 A, the opposite behavior is present.\nThis behavior can be explained by the fact that the\ncurrent Iaux generates a new magnetization characteristic\nFIGURE 31. Controllable transformer for comparison to mixed biasing.\nFIGURE 32. Calculated magnetization curves for the controllable part of\nthe transformer according to Fig. 31.

If we now compare the characteristics at a main\ncurrent I1 =1 A, we can see that the core is already saturated\nat this operating point and a current of Iaux =0 A. However,\nfor increasing auxiliary currents, the slopes of the respective\n2372 VOLUME 9, 2021\nJ.

Measurement results of small-signal measurements at mixed\nbiasing andI1 = 0 A.\nFIGURE 35. Measurement results of small-signal measurements at mixed\nbiasing andI1 = 1 A.\nmagnetization characteristics become larger at this operating\npoint. It should be noted that the increase of about 120 %\nto 135 % refers to the inductance at Iaux =0 A at the same\noperating point and not to the originally designed inductance\nin the linear range. Accordingly, a 3D diagram, as it is shown\nin Fig. 36, can be displayed for a selected frequency showing\nthe inductance as a function of the main current I1 and the\nauxiliary current Iaux.\nOf particular interest in Fig. 36 is the range of high auxil-\niary currents and main currents in the 500 mA range. In this\nrange a local maximum of inductance can be seen. This can\nbe explained by the fact that with low main currents and high\nFIGURE 36. Inductance depending onI1 and Iaux at mixed biasing\n(f = 100 kHz).\nFIGURE 37. Hysteresis curves at orthogonal biasing.\nauxiliary currents, the magnetization characteristic curve ini-\ntially runs in a very ﬂat manner due to the double S shape.\nAs the main currents increase, however, the operating point\nis shifted to steeper sections of the curve, which is noticeable\nby a larger inductance.\nC. ORTHOGONAL BIASING\nFor the investigations of the orthogonal premagnetization,\nthe E core according to Fig. 23 is used, whereby in this\ncase six holes are drilled vertically into the center leg of\nthe core. Like the experiments for mixed bias magnetiza-\ntion, lines directly adjacent to each other carry opposite\ncurrents. Also, in this DUT, the currents are marked Iaux\nby the yellow windings and the measurements are carried\nout on the white winding on the middle leg, whereby the\nblue winding on this leg can be used to set the operating\npoint.\nThe measurement results of the orthogonal premagnetiza-\ntion (see Fig. 37 and Fig. 38) show that the original hysteresis\ncurve at Iaux = 0 A is sheared. For increasing auxiliary\ncurrents, the curve becomes ﬂatter, which is equivalent to a\ndecreasing inductance. In the equivalent circuit diagram, this\nin turn means an increasing magnetic resistance. This behav-\nior is easy to understand, as the equivalent circuit diagram can\nbe expressed by a series connection of two resistors. The total\nVOLUME 9, 2021 2373\nJ.

Magnetisation curves at orthogonal biasing.\nresistance results from the sum of the parallel connection of\nthe two resistors of the outer leg (Rmag, outer-leg) and the\nresistance of the center leg (R mag, center-leg).\nRmag,total =N2\nL\n=Rm,outer−leg\n2 +Rm,center−leg (10)\nWhile the permeability of the middle and outer leg is\nchanged equally by the main current I1, the permeability of\nthe middle leg is additionally inﬂuenced by the auxiliary cur-\nrent Iaux. For an increasing auxiliary current, the permeability\nof the middle leg decreases, which increases the resistance.\nIn sum, this leads to an overall increase in resistance, which\nin turn results in a decrease in inductance. In the following,\nthe small-signal measurements are shown in Fig. 39 and\nFig. 40. The same representation is chosen as for the subsec-\ntions before.\nIf the main current I1 = 0 A, the inductance decreases\nas expected for increasing auxiliary currents. The rea-\nson for this is that there is a smaller gradient in the\n9(I) characteristic due to the sheared magnetization\ncharacteristic.\nIf the main current I1 =1 A, an additional current Iaux does\nnot reduce the inductance but can even increase it by 50 %.\nThis can be explained by the fact that current Iaux gives the\ncomponent a new magnetization characteristic. Thus, with a\nmain current of I1 =1 A and a current Iaux =0 A, the core\nis at the beginning of saturation, which means a very ﬂat\nmagnetization characteristic. At a current of Iaux = 4 A,\nhowever, the 9(I) characteristic has a much greater gradient\n(see Fig. 40).\nFigure 41 shows the inductance of the orthogonal pre-\nmagnetization at a frequency of 100 kHz. In comparison\nto Fig. 36, no local maximum can be seen. The induc-\ntance is successively reduced by increasing the main cur-\nrent. Only from a main current of 75 mA, the inductance\nbe slightly increased again by the auxiliary current. P, PM,\nPS or RM cores are particularly suitable for orthogonal\npremagnetization, since no hole must be drilled in these\ncore forms. The hole is already in the center leg and is\nFIGURE 39. Measurement results of small-signal measurements at\northogonal biasing andI1 = 0 A.\nFIGURE 40. Measurement results of small-signal measurements at\northogonal biasing andI1 = 1 A.\nFIGURE 41.

The advantage of this\nvariant is the saving of cost-intensive special ultrasonic\ndrilling due to the brittle properties of ferrites. The dis-\nadvantage, however, is that only one hole is available and\ntherefore very high currents are required to saturate the cen-\ntral core section. Figure 42 shows the results of a measure-\nment on a P36/20 core, shown in Fig. 43, with an air gap\nof 85 µm.\n2374 VOLUME 9, 2021\nJ. Pfeifferet al.: Review of Flux Interaction of Differently Aligned Magnetic Fields in Inductors and Transformers\nFIGURE 42. Measurement results of L-I-curves at orthogonal biasing of\nthe P36/20 core (f= 10 kHz).\nFIGURE 43. P36/20 core with an air gap of85 µm.\nThe measurement is again a small-signal measurement,\nwhere the frequency is not increased during the measurement,\nbut the main current I1. The measurement is carried out with\nthe Wayne Kerr 3260B measuring instrument, using a sinu-\nsoidal measuring current with an effective value of 10 mA.\nIn addition, a frequency of 10 kHz is selected, and automatic\nseries of measurements are carried out at increasing main\ncurrent I1 with preset current Iaux.\nFor an auxiliary current Iaux =10 A, the result corresponds\nto a purely orthogonal premagnetization as expected accord-\ning to Fig. 38. For increasing auxiliary currents, however,\nthe curve shape no longer corresponds to a purely orthogonal\nbias, but rather takes the form of the mixed bias magnetiza-\ntion curves. The magnetization characteristic curve from an\nauxiliary current Iaux =80 A corresponds more to a double\nS curve as shown in Fig. 30. The reason is that with these\nhigh auxiliary currents, a strong mixed premagnetization is\nnoticeable in the upper and lower area of the center leg due\nto the high ﬁeld strengths that arise.\nD. DISCUSSION OF MEASUREMENTS\nThe measurements and evaluations of these tests require\nsome preliminary considerations, since due to the transformer\ndesign, elements of the electric circuit for premagnetization\nare often also measured. In the measurement results shown\nhere, care was taken to ensure that no inﬂuence is caused\nby the additional circuits. The inﬂuences were eliminated\naccordingly by comparative measurements and calculations,\nso that errors could be minimized. Furthermore, the inﬂuence\nof parasitic capacitances and coupling capacitances, espe-\ncially in small-signal measurements, cannot be neglected.\nHowever, false measurement results are not only caused by\nthe inﬂuence of the test setup or the environment, but also\nby the measurement methodology. For small-signal measure-\nments, either a ﬁxed alternate voltage or an alternate current\nis speciﬁed, while the frequency or the main current I1 is\nsuccessively increased during the measurement. The phase\nbetween current and voltage and, depending on the previous\nsetting of alternate voltage or current (drive level), its coun-\nterpart is measured. The example of measurement via fre-\nquency illustrates the problem. In the lower frequency range,\nthe impedance of an inductance is very low and thus, with the\nalternate voltage set, the resulting current is very high. In con-\ntrast, at high frequencies, the impedance is high and thus the\nresulting current is signiﬁcantly lower. As a result, a measure-\nment over the frequency produces a signiﬁcantly different\nlevel of the hysteresis curve, which in turn has a signiﬁcant\neffect on the inductance due to the non-linearity. Furthermore,\nthe waveforms shown and thus also the control characteristics\nare signiﬁcantly dependent on the selected alternate voltage\nwaveform. In the tests shown, a pure sine-wave voltage was\nalways used, which was repeatedly checked. Distortions of\nthe voltages are directly visible in the inductance due to the\nchanged hysteresis loop.\nE. SUMMARY\nThe measurements have shown that there are several other\nways to control an inductor in addition to the classical mag-\nnetic ampliﬁer with an additional winding on the core. Not\nonly the physical relationship of the windings to each other\nis crucial, but also the interconnection of the windings on a\ncore plays a signiﬁcant role (see Fig. 25 and 27). Furthermore,\nthe core plays a decisive role in mixed and orthogonal pre-\nmagnetization. Particularly in orthogonal premagnetization,\nareas are repeatedly created in which the ﬁelds in the core are\nno longer just orthogonal to each other despite the orthogonal\narrangement of the windings. The effect is accordingly a\ntransition to the magnetization characteristics of the mixed\npremagnetization (see Fig. 42). A further decisive inﬂuence\nfor an application is the arrangement of the holes in the core.\nA comparison of Fig. 41 and 42 shows clearly that much\nhigher currents with slightly fewer turns are necessary to\nachieve corresponding results.\nIn conclusion, it should be mentioned that a controllable\nmagnetic component can be constructed using all three vari-\nants. A decisive difference between the mixed and orthogo-\nnal premagnetization through holes compared to the parallel\nbiasing is that these types give the component completely new\nmagnetization curves and thus properties. Parallel premagne-\ntization, on the other hand, shifts the operating point on the\noriginal magnetization characteristic curve and thus exploits\nthe nonlinear properties of the component.\nVOLUME 9, 2021 2375\nJ. Pfeifferet al.: Review of Flux Interaction of Differently Aligned Magnetic Fields in Inductors and Transformers\nVI. POTENTIALS AND OPEN RESEARCH QUESTIONS\nThrough superimposition of differently aligned magnetic\nﬁelds, an additional degree of freedom in the design process\nof magnetic devices is gained. This offers new possibilities\nand potentials for the overall application, regarding its design,\ncontrol structure and efﬁciency.\nAs it was shown in Sec. II, some methods of super-\nposing differently aligned magnetic ﬁelds have been used\nfor decades. Other methods are still unused so far, which\nhas various reasons. In this section, the potential of\nthe presented methods in Sec. II will be addressed and\ndiscussed.\nFurthermore, there are numerous open research questions\nwhich have to be investigated to get a deeper understanding\nof the technique.\nA. POTENTIALS\nAccording to Sec. II, parallel biasing is often used, especially\nfor variable inductors and transformers (see [18]–[22]) or in\nLED supply and general electronic ballast applications, as it\nis presented in [35]–[44].\nHowever, mixed biasing as well as orthogonal biasing are\nrarely used nowadays. One important reason is the focus on\nsemiconductor power devices, which have been subject to a\nrapid development over the last decades.\nControllable magnetic devices are able to support that\nimprovement, e. g. through the achievement of zero-voltage\nswitching (ZVS) which becomes more and more sig-\nniﬁcant regarding the efﬁciency and cooling manage-\nment of wide-band gap semiconductors, especially gallium\nnitride (GaN) devices.\nAn example for weight reduction of an inductor together\nwith a reduction of switching losses using mixed and\northogonal biasing is presented in [119]. In this article,\nsilicon (Si) MOSFETs are used for low voltage calcula-\ntions, simulations and measurement results. Nevertheless,\nthe approach is transferable to the GaN technology. Further-\nmore, the presented calculations and simulations for high\nvoltage are performed using silicon carbide (SiC) MOSFETs.\nThe results show a signiﬁcant beneﬁt in weight and efﬁciency\nfor higher voltages because of the elimination of recovery\nlosses.\nTo increase the efﬁcency of the auxiliary current circuit,\nthe auxiliary winding can be applied with multiple turns. The\nrequired current decreases by the number of turns with no\nadditional negative impact on the magnetic device as [121]\nshows.\nOther investigations deal with harmonic mitigation using\ncontrollable magnetic devices. In [71], the concept of a\nV AG-VR is presented and investigated. This reactor makes\nuse of mixed biasing, what requires additional drill holes\nwithin the iron core. The presented results show signiﬁcant\nreductions of the 3rd as well as the 5th and 7th harmonic.\nThe concept has been developed through several\nprototypes (see [2]) and applied in a demonstrator\nfor reactive power management in distribution grids\n(medium-voltage grids) to compensate reactive power feed-in\nof renewable energy sources (see [121]).\nSuperimposition of differently aligned magnetic ﬁelds can\nbe used to control resonant circuits and transformers. The\nvariation of the transformers’ main or leakage inductance\ncould be used in resonant circuits to enable an operation\non a ﬁxed frequency, even with a variable load. In this\ndesign scenario, the needed auxiliary current in the trans-\nformer would replace the frequency as the main control\nparameter. A control structure for the auxiliary bias cur-\nrent would be more complicated than a frequency-based\napproach but the change could have a signiﬁcant beneﬁt on\nthe application’s characteristic regarding its electromagnetic\ncompatibility.\nB. OPEN RESEARCH QUESTIONS\nAlthough, superimposition of differently aligned magnetic\nﬁelds in inductors and transformers has been used for almost\na century and was subject of many investigations, there are\nstill open research questions which will be dealt with within\nthe following paragraphs.\nAn important question is the impact of the magnetic core’s\ngeometry on the behavior of the superposition. Especially\nregarding orthogonal biasing, it seems that the impact of\nthe superimposition method depends on the core geometry.\nFurther investigations have to be made to get a deeper under-\nstanding of the relations and inner processes within the core\nmaterial.\nA related question to the impact of the core geometry is the\neffect on the core losses. This question is particularly relevant\nto mixed and orthogonal biasing which tend to saturate main\nparts of the magnetic core material.\nCore losses themselves are still a current research topic.\nConsidering the permanent improvement and generalization\nof the Steinmetz equation, many impact factors have to be\ninvestigated. Furthermore, most investigations are limited to\nsinusoidal wave forms and small-signal measurements. There\nare some publications which deal with large-signal investiga-\ntions, e. g. [123], but signiﬁcantly more research is needed\nto obtain clarity related to core losses - with and without\nsuperimposed magnetic ﬁelds.\nWhen referring to large-signal measurements, it has to be\nsaid that this topic also contains various open research ques-\ntions. Especially regarding non-sinusoidal wave forms, only a\nfew investigations have been made so far. Most investigations\nand publications rely on small-signal measurements made\nwith sinusoidal wave forms. However, the bias point and with\nit the core magnetization is completely different compared to\nan application. The impact of these signiﬁcant changes have\nto be investigated closely to optimize the magnetic device as\nwell as the superimposition method.\nIn addition to the poor understanding of orthogonal ﬂux\ninteraction, there are currently no methods to analytically\nor numerically divide mixed interaction into parallel and\northogonal, though this aspect may gain signiﬁcance with\nfuture better understanding of both single phenomena.\n2376 VOLUME 9, 2021\nJ. Pfeifferet al.: Review of Flux Interaction of Differently Aligned Magnetic Fields in Inductors and Transformers\nA large portion of the magnetic core is usually used for\nthe magnetic circuit around the RSI resulting in high material\nconsumption and ultimately high cost. Therefore, new core\ngeometries as well as concepts to efﬁciently use existing ones\nmust be developed.\nAs elaborated in Sec. III-B, the current models for orthog-\nonal magnetization (and therefore mixed, too) rely on many,\nin part unrealistic assumptions, demanding better models.\nHowever, with more accurate intrinsic models, the existing\ntheories for electric terminal behavior may quickly become\npowerful tools.\nVII. CONCLUSION\nIn this article, three different methods of ﬂux interac-\ntion of differently aligned magnetic ﬁelds were presented.\nAn overview of their history and usage as well as a mathemat-\nical modeling approach were given and discussed. The effects\nof the three methods were shown in simulation and measure-\nment results. Furthermore, some possible applications were\ngiven and their potential was discussed.\nThe three different methods of ﬂux interaction of differ-\nently aligned magnetic ﬁelds (parallel, mixed and orthogo-\nnal biasing) differ signiﬁcantly in their mode of action and\ntheir applications. With their usage, an additional degree of\nfreedom is gained during the device’s design process that can\ncreate some signiﬁcant beneﬁts.\nFurthermore, it has been shown that ﬂux interaction can\nbe represented within magnetic circuits, which again can be\ncoupled with electric circuits. Parallel magnetization is as\nsimple as adding another MMF source to the circuit and\npossibly to reluctances for a more realistic model. Orthogonal\nﬂux interaction is more complicated to describe as it needs the\nintroduction of two or more nonlinearly coupled reluctances.\nThe analytical and rather idealized theory to describe this\ncoupling has been derived, assumptions have been identiﬁed\nand deviations have been estimated from realities. However,\nthere is still a need for more profound theory, especially when\nit comes to intrinsic interaction on the microscopic scale.\nAlso, specialized core geometries have to be invented in order\nto use orthogonal magnetization efﬁciently.\nHowever, regardless of its possible potential, the majority\nof these methods is still unused to a large extent. The reasons\nmight be the various open research questions. Further inves-\ntigations are absolutely necessary and essential to unfold the\npossibilities that lie dormant in this technique.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors thank the SUMIDA Components and Modules\nGmbH in Obernzell, Germany, for manufacturing or machin-\ning most of the ferrite cores which were used to generate\nthe presented measurement results.
