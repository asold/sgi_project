Introduction \nThe power transformer is the key equipment in a power system; therefore, the normal \noperation of the transformer is critical for t he safety and stability of the system. Failure mode \nand effects analysis, first developed at Grumman Aircraft Corporation in the 1950s, is the \nmethodology most commonly used to perform preventive maintenance. This maintenance \nidentifies and eliminates known and/or potential  failures, beginning by ranking the highest-\npriority issues [1, 2]. Traditional FMEA determine s the risk priorities of failure modes by using \nthe risk priority number, which is determined by ea ch risk factor’s occurrence (O), severity (S) \nand detection (D). Traditional RPN is a product of these three factors [3, 4]. That is: \n \nRPN O S D                                                                (1) \n \nThe drawbacks of using RPN to prioriti ze failure mode maintenance for power \ntransformer parts are clear [5-8]. They include primarily different sets of risk factors may \nproduce the same RPN value, but their risk implic ations may be quite different. And the relative \nimportance of O, S and D is not taken into account. \nThe fuzzy set theory, which has demonstrated great capability and performs in a variety \nof application domains such as control and mode ling [9, 10], can capture the uncertainty and \nambiguity of factors. Thus, the fuzzy RPN has been widely utilized in FMEA to overcome some \nof traditional FMEA’s aforementioned drawbacks [11, 12]. However, approaches based primarily \non probability or fuzzy set theory usually ignore all uncertainties that may occur during the \nevaluation process. In addition,  the fuzzy RPN model lacks an effective way to translate \nqualitative evaluation to quant itative numerical value. Thus, FMEA based on fuzzy theory \ncannot attach enough importance to uncertainty to adequately assess and prioritize risk \nmaintenance in the power transformer. \nThis paper proposes a novel FMEA method, based on the cloud model of weight, which \nwill fully recognize and incorporate the importan ce of uncertainty in the risk assessment \nprocess. This method overcomes the defects of  traditional FMEA assessment methods (non-\ndifferential analysis of evaluation index and th e danger of assuming that equal RPN values \nindicate equal amounts of actual  risk) and thereby improves the credibility of risk assessment. \nTELKOMNIKA  ISSN: 1693-6930  \n \nFailure Mode and Effect Analysis of Power Transformer Based on Cloud… (Jianpeng Bian) \n777\nThe proposed method also provides a c onvincing foundation for planning an efficient \nmaintenance strategy, which will improve the transformer’s security and value.  \nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the FMEA based on \nthe cloud model of weight method. Section 3 illust rates the practical application of this method \nto assess the power transformer. Section 4 presents conclusions. \n \n \n2. FMEA Based on Cloud Model of Weight \n2.1. Evaluation Index of Power Transformer \nIn order to properly assess the power transf ormer, we must establish the key index of \nthe assessment. It would not be practical to inclu de every possible risk factor in this example. \nInstead, key index were chosen that are broad enough to encompass the entire structure of the \npower transformer, represent each critical part and produce a comprehensive risk assessment.  \nThere are many possible failure modes in  a transformer, and their probability of \noccurrence, detection and severity differ. Based on statistical data and expert opinion, traditional \nFMEA calculates the probability of each failure mode and ranks these probabilities into 5 \ngrades. The higher the grade is, the greater the potential danger to the power transformer \n(Table 1-3). \n \n \nTable 1.

Construction of the Cloud Model of Weight \nCloud model is a new model for concept representation and captures the uncertain \ntransition between qualitative concept and it s quantitative representation. The digital \ncharacteristics of clouds can integrate the fu zziness and randomness of linguistic terms in a \nunified way, which lays a foundation of knowledg e representation. Therefore, the cloud model \ncan mimic a human being’s thinking and is more flexible and effective than the conventional \nfuzzy reasoning methods in representing uncertainty and propagating knowledge. The \ncalculation method of the cloud model of weight is based on the product of the square root. The \nspecific process is as follows [13]: \n(1) Construction of the cloud matrix of contrast  \nEvery element in the cloud matrix of contrast is constituted by the cloud model. The \nelement ikC represents the contributing degree of the sub-index if to the prior-index, which is \nrelative to kf . Assume the number of the sub-index is n . Through analyzing the characteristics \nof the pair-wise comparison cloud matrix , it is clear that the diagonal element iiC represents the \nimportant degree of comparison, that is, 1iiEx  , 0iiEn  , 0iiHe  . Again, the element ikC\nrepresents the contributing degree of the sub-index if to the prior-index, which is relative to kf\nand the symmetrical element kiC is the contrast. So, the ikC and kiC must satisfy the following \nrelation: \n \n11 1 11 11 11 11 1 1 1 1\n1n 1 1 1 1\n,, C ( , , ) ,, ( , , )\n    =       \n,, C ( , , ) ,, ( , , )\nnn n n n\nn nn n n n nn nn nn nn\nC C Ex En He C Ex En He\nC\nC C Ex En He C Ex En He\n   \n         \n     \n                    (2) \n \n22\n11 (, , ) () ()\nki\nik ik ik ik\nEn HecC cE x E x E x                                          (3) \n \n(2) Value of the elements in the cloud matrix of contrast  \nWhen constructing the cloud matrix of cont rast, the mutually important degrees of the \ndifferent index should be determined first to form the cloud model, that is, the cloud’s pole. \nSecondly, experts must determine the degree of each sub-index’s importance relative to the \ncloud’s pole. Finally, the results are synthesized. The concrete process for a cloud weight based \nFMEA analysis of a power transformer is as follows: \nThe degree of mutual importance of FMEA’s three risk factors (S, O, and D) is divided \ninto five ranks. Experts determine the mutually important degree of each factor relative to the \ncloud model’s pole. The qualitative results are quantified through the application of synthesized, \nmulti-expert quantification to determi ne the value of each factor. The\nEx  and of the cloud \nmodel of different important degree is listed in Table 4. And . \n \n \nTable 4.

Practical Applications of FMEA Based on Cloud Weight  \nLet us consider a sample 500kV power transformer and analyze it using FMEA based \non the cloud weight model. The operational history and maintenance records of our sample \ntransformer show that the transformer has ex perienced a short-term emergency load and has \nhad one overhaul. The major problem with this trans former is that a group of cooler terminals \nhas burned, the hand of the on-load tap-changer (OLT C) is normal but the electric operation is \nbad and the oil gauge level is lower than normal. The inspection of body of transformer is \nnormal.  \n \n \nTable 6.

Clearly, the three risk factors of potential \nfailure for the Active part and the Tank are different. However, using traditional RPN calculus, \nthese two parts would be assigned the same RPN and have the same maintenance priority \nranking. \nThis paper evaluates the intertwined impor tance of the risk factors of severity, \noccurrence and detection in a power transformer,  quantifies these qualitative results plus multi-\nexpert opinions, and creates a judgment matrix as follows: \n1        3      4\n1/3    1       3\n1/4    1/3    1\nD\n\n \n\n                                                            (11) \n(, , )iii iM Ex En He\nW\nTELKOMNIKA  ISSN: 1693-6930  \n \nFailure Mode and Effect Analysis of Power Transformer Based on Cloud… (Jianpeng Bian) \n781\nThe pair-wise comparison cloud matrix can be constructed according to Equation (2)-(3) \nto determine the cloud model of weight of t he three variables.

Two risk \nfactors—occurrence and detection— are comparatively high for the Non-electrical protection and \nBushing parts, but the severity factor is comparatively low. Thus, potential failure maintenance \nshould be time-based according to the threshol d of RPN. One risk factor—occurrence—is high \nfor the Cooler system and Tank parts, but the severity and detection factors are low; therefore, \nfailure maintenance for these two parts should occur on an extended maintenance schedule \naccording to the threshold RPN. \nAlthough the severity and occurrence factors for the Active part are comparatively high, \nthe detection factor is very low. Maintenance fo r this part, which is behind the tank, may occur \non a corrective schedule. \n \n \n4. Conclusion \nThis paper illustrates the use of the cloud mo del of weight to determine the mutually \nintertwined importance of FMEA failure risk fact ors occurrence (O), severity (S) and detection \n(D) to analyze a power transformer and optimize a finely tuned risk-adjusted maintenance \n\n                   ISSN: 1693-6930 \nTELKOMNIKA  Vol. 13, No. 3, September 2015 :  776 – 782 \n782\nschedule. The paper compares FMEA based on cloud weights to the currently more commonly \nused traditional FMEA, which scores and prioriti zes risk through a simple calculation of RPN. \nThe cloud model of weight is more practical and flexible than traditional RPN values, as it is \ncapable of taking into consideration the relative  importance among the risk factors O, S and D, \nas well as allowing for uncertainties that c an occur during transformer performance tests and \nevaluations. Based on the practical example offered in the paper, the cloud weight based model \nshows its potential advantage in detecting hi gh risks of power failures in transformers \nsystematically and effectively.  \nAlso, very importantly, we show that evaluat ing risk factors using cloud weight analysis \nmay help parse out the actual differences in risk  that may lurk behind the apparently equal RPN \nthat traditional FMEA analysis generally produces. It is evident that the proposed model can not \nonly reduce manpower investment in power transformer maintenance, but also mitigate the risks \nand expenses associated with power transformer failures.  \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nThis work was supported by the National Na tural Science Foundation of China (Grant \nNo. 51307112) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51274144) and \nthe Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Pr ovince (Grant No. F2012210031) and China \nPostdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant No. 2013T60197).And Colleges and Universities youth \ntalent program projects of Hebei Province (Grant No.BJ2014054). \n \n \nReferences \n[1] Hoseynabadi HA, Oraee H, Tavner PJ.
