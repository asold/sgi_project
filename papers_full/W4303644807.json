    "abstract": "Forest fires seriously destroy the world’s forest resources and endanger biodiversity. The traditional forest fire target detection models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) lack the ability to deal with the relationship between visual elements and objects. They also have low detection accuracy for small-target forest fires. Therefore, this paper proposes an improved small-target forest fire detection model, STPM_SAHI. We use the latest technology in the field of computer vision, the Swin Transformer backbone network, to extract the features of forest fires. Its self-attention mechanism can capture the global information of forest fires to obtain larger receptive fields and contextual information. We integrated the Swin Transformer backbone network into the Mask R-CNN detection framework, and PAFPN was used to replace the original FPN as the feature fusion network, which can reduce the propagation path of the main feature layer and eliminate the impact of down-sampling fusion. After the improved model was trained, the average precision (AP0.5) of forest fire target detection at different scales reached 89.4. Then, Slicing Aided Hyper Inference technology was integrated into the improved forest fire detection model, which solved the problem that small-target forest fires pixels only account for a small proportion and lack sufficient details, which are difficult to be detected by the traditional target detection models. The detection accuracy of small-target forest fires was significantly improved. The average precision (AP0.5) increased by 8.1. Through an ablation experiment, we have proved the effectiveness of each module of the improved forest fire detection model. Furthermore, the forest fire detection accuracy is significantly better than that of the mainstream models. Our model can also detect forest fire targets with very small pixels. Our model is very suitable for small-target forest fire detection. The detection accuracy of forest fire targets at different scales is also very high and meets the needs of real-time forest fire detection.",
