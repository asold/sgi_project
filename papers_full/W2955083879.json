Introduction\nHigh power DC-DC converters with galvanic isolation are\na key element of many applications, as for example medium\nvoltage DC (MVDC) grids (1)–(4), solid-state transformers and\npower supplies for traction(5)–(8), or more-electric ships(9).A n -\nother application are battery interfaces used in electric ve-\nhicles or traction systems\n(10) (11).I n F i g . 1/Table 1 a possible\nsetup and speciﬁcations of such a battery interface for a lo-\ncomotive are given. The system enables to store recuperated\nenergy during braking, what reduces the total energy con-\nsumption and enables reuse of the recuperated energy during\nthe acceleration phase. Additionally, energy stored in the bat-\nteries can be used to drive the locomotive on non-electriﬁed\ntracks without a diesel engine, avoiding CO\n2 emissions (e.g.\nin shunt yards).\nThe considered battery interface is based on a dual active\nbridge (DAB) converter(12). The series connection of modules\nat the medium voltage secondary side allows to use switch-\ning devices with lower voltage ratings for all switches. It also\nmakes the transformer isolation requirements more severe. A\nhigh eﬃciency and high power density is required due to the\nspace limitations in the locomotive. The high power density\nis achieved by optimising the converter design and by push-\ning the switching frequency of the semiconductor devices\nto higher values under ZVS condition. Several examples\nfor high power medium voltage DC-DC converters with gal-\nvanic isolation can be found in the literature\n(1) (4)–(8). Figure 2\ngives a comparison of some of these converter systems in the\neﬃciency-power density plane based on data provided in the\nliterature. For achieving a high power density, the advanced\ncooling concepts\n(13) have to be used in transformer.

E ﬃciency - power density comparison of the\npresented system to the previous state of the art solu-\ntions. All the results are given for a single module with\nfull isolation rating of the transformer. For the design\npresented in\n(8), both calculated and measured eﬃciency -\npower density values are given, where the represents\nthe measured values. The presented design only shows\nthe calculated eﬃciency - power density values\nthe aluminium heat sink mounted on the transformer core (21).\nUnfortunately, the thermal conductivity of such coil formers\nis considerably lower than for aluminium, which results in\nlarger transformer volumes.\nIn order to increase the power density, a transformer with\nintegrated liquid cooling is presented in this paper. The\ncooling system can be operated with water /glycol as a cool-\ning medium, despite the high nominal isolation voltage of\nV\niso = 2.8 kV. For designing the integrated cooling struc-\nture, analytical thermal models are presented and veriﬁed\nwith FEM simulations and measurements. In section 2 ﬁrst\nthe short overview of the design procedure is outlined, fol-\nlowed with used models for the transformer design. There,\nspecial attention is dedicated to the thermal modeling of the\nintegrated cooling structure with water channels. Results of\nFEM simulations for diﬀerent design aspects are given in sec-\ntion 3. Finally, experimental measurements on a prototype\nsystem are presented in section 4, followed by conclusions.\n2. Transformer Design\nThe system shown in Fig. 1 is used as battery interface in\nlocomotives. Since the secondary side (DC link side) is con-\nnected in series, the nominal primary and secondary voltages\nare approximately equal (Table 1). This enables to use the\nsame switching devices for both full bridges. For the pre-\nsented system 1200 V SiC MOSFET devices are employed.\nUsing SiC MOSFETs under ZVS conditions, enables higher\nswitching frequencies.\nIn order to determine the parameters for the highest power\ndensity, an optimization of the converter modulation scheme\nand the transformer (Fig. 3) is performed for worst case in-\nput conditions. The modulation parameters of the DAB con-\nverter are the phase shift angle φ, clamping interval of the\nprimary side bridge δ\n1, the clamping interval of the sec-\nondary side bridge δ2 and frequency fs. Illustrative expla-\nnation of the modulation parameters is shown in Fig. 4. More\ndetails about the used modulation schemes and the descrip-\ntion of the implementation are given in\n(22). The optimization\nFig. 3.

Exemplary voltage and current waveforms at the\ntransformer terminals for a random set of control param-\neters [φ2,δ1,δ2]\nis multi-objective, i.e. both the system volume and the to-\ntal system losses are minimized. Starting with the system\nspeciﬁcations (Table 1) at step 0in Fig. 3, ﬁrst the converter\nelectrical model for the initial control parameters is derived\nin step 1, giving at the output the voltage-current waveforms\nand required leakage inductance ( L\nσ). The voltage-current\nwaveforms (Fig. 4) are used to calculate the losses in the\nswitching devices in step 2.I n step 3, the calculated out-\nput power P\nout (deﬁned by the control parameters) is com-\npared to the required power Pnom. In the same step, semi-\nconductor losses are calculated and veriﬁed to be below the\nmaximum speciﬁed losses. If any of the constraints is not\nfulﬁlled, the control parameters are changed and the proce-\ndure restarts. In step 4, the transformer optimization loop\nis executed which determines a suitable core geometry and\n686 IEEJ Journal IA, Vol.8, No.4, 2019\nModeling and Design of a Medium-Frequency TransformerʢMiloˇs Stojadinovi´c et al.ʣ\nFig. 5. Exploded view CAD drawing of the designed\ntransformer with integrated cooling structure\nwinding arrangement that fulﬁls the following constraints:\npeak ﬂux density Bm ≤Bsat, leakage inductance L =Lsigma\nand temperature rise T ≤Tmax. If any of the constraint is\nnot met the calculation restarts with new control parameters.\nAfter all the feasible designs are obtained in step 5, the opti-\nmal design (step 6) is chosen at the knee point of the pareto\ncurve. For the considered system, major challenges are the\ndesign of the transformer and the e ﬃcient heat removal. In\norder to improve the heat removal, foil conductors are used\nfor the transformer windings. Using foil only slightly in-\ncreases the eddy current losses in the windings compared\nto the litz wire\n(23), but due to the large copper ﬁlling factor\nand surface area, foil windings are preferred from a ther-\nmal and a size point of view. In Fig. 5 the CAD drawing\nof the transformer with integrated cooling system is shown\nfor the speciﬁcations given in Table 1. One of the speciﬁ-\ncations for the transformer and semiconductor cooling sys-\ntem is to use tap water. Therefore, the whole liquid cooling\nstructure is at the ground potential. The cooling channels\nare used for cooling the switches and the transformer. The\nchannel structure can be seen in Fig. 12. Because of the high\nisolation requirement between the transformer windings, the\ncooling channels are placed only on the outer core legs of\nthe transformer. For removing the heat from the transformer\nprimary winding, ﬁrst an aluminium bar was considered as a\npart of the bottom cooling part (Fig. 14). The bar is placed\nbetween the winding and the transformer middle leg. Due\nto the induced eddy current losses, the aluminium bar was\nreplaced with an aluminium nitride (AlN) bar (Fig. 15). Alu-\nminium nitride is an electrical isolator which oﬀers high ther-\nmal conductivity equivalent to thermal conductivity of alu-\nminium (Table 2). For cooling the secondary winding and\nfulﬁlling the isolation requirement, the transformer is pot-\nted using a thermally conductive casting compound Wepesil\nVU 4675,w h i c hoﬀers a wide operating temperature range\nand low hardness. For isolating the secondary side switches,\nan AlN plate is used to separate the secondary side cooling\nstructure, on which the secondary side switches are mounted,\nand the grounded bottom cooling part. The ﬁxation of the\naluminium and AlN plate to the main structure is achieved\nwith nylon glass ﬁlled bolts. By increasing the outer diam-\neter and rounding the edges of the holes in the aluminium\nparts (see Fig. 6) it is possible to shape the e-ﬁeld in order to\nfulﬁl the given isolation requirements.

The\nmethod is based on an 1D approximation of the H-ﬁeld in\nthe windings, which results in the resistance factor expressed\nin the term of hyperbolic trigonometric functions of the skin\npenetration depth.\n2.1.2 Core Losses For calculating the transformer\ncore losses the Improved Generalized Steinmetz Equation\n(iGSE), presented in\n(25), is used. This procedure takes the\nderivative of the ﬂux waveform, as well as the peak-to-peak\nvalue of the ﬂux into account in order to calculate the core\nloss. The method oﬀers good precision with low complexity,\nwhich is advantageous for optimization problems.\nCare must be taken when using manufacturer loss measure-\nments for core materials. These measurements are usually\nperformed on small toroidal cores and the losses might be\nsigniﬁcantly lower (2-3x) compared to the losses in the cores\nwith diﬀerent shapes (e.g. lare E-U-core). It is advisable to\ncompare the losses of the actual used core, usually given just\nfor a single frequency and ﬂux point, to the same point on the\n687 IEEJ Journal IA, Vol.8, No.4, 2019\nModeling and Design of a Medium-Frequency TransformerʢMiloˇs Stojadinovi´c et al.ʣ\nFig. 7. Transformer geometry for calculating leakage\ninductance\nloss curves in the material datasheet, and scale the curves ac-\ncordingly. The core material which is used during the design\nprocedure is EPCOS N97(Table 2).\n2.2 Isolation The required isolation level translates\ninto a minimum distance diso between the conductors:\ndiso,min = Viso\nkisoEiso\n································ (1)\nwhere Eiso is the dielectric strength of the isolation material\nextracted from material manufacturer datasheet, Viso is the\nvoltage required to be isolated, and kiso ∈[0,1] is the safety\ncoeﬃcient that is highly dependent on the transformer con-\nstruction and the used isolating material. There are very few\nsources in literature that discuss selection of this parameter.\nAdditionally, the given formula does not take into account the\ninhomogeneity of the electric ﬁeld. Because of these reasons,\nfor the presented design a very conservative value of 0.04 is\nused for the safety coeﬃcient k\niso. For the chosen transformer\nwinding geometry given in Fig. 7, the parameters dL and diso\nmust have a greater value than the value of diso,min.\n2.3 Leakage Inductance Modeling The winding\nheight in transformer design with relatively high isolation re-\nquirements is typically smaller than the core window height.\nIn order to calculate the leakage inductance in such design, a\nformula that employs the Rogowski coeﬃcient can be used\n(26)\nLσ=μ0N2\np\nπDmeanwL\n√\nhcuP ·hcuS\nkσ······················· (2)\nwhere Np is the number of primary turns, Dmean is the mean\ndiameter of the reduced leakage channel, wL is the width\nof the reduced leakage channel, hcuP is the primary winding\nheight, hcuS is the secondary winding height, and kσ is the\nRogowski coeﬃcient. A simpliﬁed illustration of the trans-\nformer winding structure is depicted in Fig. 7. The expres-\nsions for calculating the required parameters in the leakage\ninductance formula have been adapted for taking into account\nthe non-circular shape of the windings\nw\nL =dP +dS\n3 +dL ····························· (3)\nkσ≈1 −dP +dS +dL\nπ√\nhcuP ·hcuS\n························· (4)\nDmean =D +dP +dL +dS −dS −dP\n2\ndP +dS +4dL\ndP +dS +3dL\n···················· (5)\nwhere D is the equivalent internal diameter of the inner wind-\ning, and can be calculated as\nD =2\n√\n(bc +dP)(dc +dP)\nπ ······················ (6)\nThe given formulas for leakage inductance calculation are\nvalid for cases where the heights of the primary and sec-\nondary winding are approximately the same. Larger di ﬀer-\nences in winding heights lead to larger deviations in the cal-\nculation, and the given formulas lose on their accuracy.\n2.4 Thermal Modeling Two main types of heat\ntransfer are considered in the thermal model - the conduc-\ntive heat transfer and the convective heat transfer. Due to\nrelatively small di ﬀerences between surface body tempera-\ntures and ambient temperatures, the radiative heat transfer is\nneglected in the considered model. The expressions for cal-\nculating conductive heat transfer are very simple and can be\nfound for example in\n(30). In Fig. 8 the internal channel struc-\nture of the integrated cooling system is shown. For modeling\nthe conductive ﬂow in the channel of the integrated cooling\nstructure, a basic channel model is shown in Fig. 9. There are\ntwo thermal resistances that are used for modeling the heat\ntransfer through the channel. The conductive thermal resis-\ntance R\nth,r from the hot surface to the channel wall, and the\nconvective thermal resistance Rth,d from channel wall to the\ncooling medium temperature. These thermal resistances can\nbe calculated using\nR\nth,r = a\nwlλHS\n·································· (7)\nRth,d = 1\nhlπde\n··································· (8)\nwhere wis the width of the channel, a is the distance from\nhot surface to the center of the channel, l is the length of\nthe channel, de =\n√\nA is the equivalent channel diameter\nthat takes into account channels of non-circular shape, A is\nthe cross-sectional area of the channel, and λHS is the ther-\nmal conductivity of heat sink material.
