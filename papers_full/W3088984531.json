The\nsituation quickly escalated into an epidemic all over China with tens of thousands of infections\nand several thousand deaths [1–3]. As of July 2, 2020, more than 10.7 million people were\ninfected and over 515 thousands have died across the globe.\nInfection of the virus weakens the host’s immune system, leading to Corona Virus Disease\n2019 (COVID-19). The pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection with aggressive inflamma-\ntory responses causes damage to the airways, and the disease severity depends on not only the\nviral infection but also the host immune response. Current estimates are that 2019-nCoV has\nan incubation period of 2 to 14 days, with potential asymptomatic transmission [4–7].\nHubei province is located in the central region of China and Wuhan is the capital city of\nHubei. With the traffic to and from the rest parts of the country, Wuhan had become the gate-\nway for COVID-19 epidemic in China and is the most affected area in the country [8, 9]. The\nsituation was further worsened by the Chinese Spring Festival travel rush (from mid-January\nto the end of February), when the world’s largest annual human migration occurs. On January\n23, a lockdown in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province started in an effort to quarantine\nthe epicenter. Recent statistics suggest that almost 95% of reported COVID-19 cases in China\noriginated from Wuhan [8].\nWuhan Pulmonary Hospital was a tertiary infectious disease hospital before the outbreak,\nwith 610 beds and ten ICU beds. When the COVID-19 epidemic started in Wuhan, it became\none of the first Covid-19 designated hospitals and has received more than 700 COVID-19\npatients so far. In this study we aim to provide some preliminary analysis result using several\nbasic characteristics to evaluate the patient’s risk and progress. We have further implemented\nour findings into a prototype interactive web tool for more practical uses.\nMaterials and methods\nEthics approval\nThe study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Ethics committee of Wuhan Pulmonary\nHospital (WPE 2020–8). Written informed consents were obtained from all participants before\nenrollment. Patient records and information were de-identified prior to the analysis.\nProcess flow at the hospital\nFig 1 illustrates the process flow in Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital. The patients were received\nfrom two sources: 1. Outpatient visit. People with symptoms such as fever, cough, or diarrhea\nmade an Outpatient visit and took a blood test to exclude the possibility of bacterial infection.\nThey then took an Influenza test to exclude the possibility of Influenza. Next a lung CT was\ntaken to identify the infected area. Finally, a COVID-19 throat swab was taken to confirm the\ninfection; 2. COVID-19 positive cases from the module hospital, which is generally composed\nof medical functional units, ward units, technical support units, etc. In February 2020, to cope\nwith the new corona in Wuhan for the virus outbreak, the National Health Commission and\nrelated units established Wuhan Vulcan Mountain Hospital, Wuhan Thunder Mountain Hos-\npital, and 13 Fangcang hospitals (also called as square-cabin hospitals) in Wuhan. These\npatients were transferred to Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital if their condition became severe or\ncritical. Once the patient was hospitalized, regular examinations on T cell subsets, COVID-19\nPCR test, and lung CT were taken place to closely monitor the patient’s progress. Most patients\nwho were hospitalized from January 28, 2020 to March 8, 2020 received treatment according\nto the fifth edition of the Ministry of Health guidelines [10]: 1. Bed rest and supportive\nPLOS ONE\nA visualization tool using T cell subsets to evaluate COVID-19 patient’s severity\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02396 95 September 24, 2020 2 / 12\ntreatment; 2. Regular examination on blood routine, CRP, biochemistry, coagulation function,\nmyocardial enzymes, lung CT; 3. Oxygen therapy, including nasal catheter oxygen, transposal\nhigh-flow oxygen therapy, ventilator; 4. Antiviral therapy, including Lopinavir/Ritonavir tab-\nlets, Arbidol Hydrochloride Tablets, etc. If the patient maintained a normal body temperature\nfor at least three days, and tested negative with COVID-19 (including throat swab, stool, and\nsputum) at least twice and 24+ hours apart, as well as showing significant improvement in\nlung CT, the patient would be considered recovered and discharged from the hospital. The dis-\ncharged patients were transported by the Chinese government using designated vehicles and\nthey were further isolated for at least two weeks.\nStudy population and data collection\nFrom January 31 to March 8, 2020, a total of 721 patients who tested positive of COVID-19\nwere admitted to Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital. Among these patients, 430 completed the treat-\nment and were discharged, 62 died, and 229 still remained in hospitalization. Excluding four\npatients whose direct cause of death was not COVID-19 infection, and selecting patients who\nhad at least one T cell Subsets test available, we had a total of 340 patients in the study, includ-\ning 310 discharged cases and 30 death cases. Each hospitalized patient was asked by the doctor\non the day of admission to confirm whether they had any underlying disease. We reviewed lab-\noratory test results and chest CT examinations of these 340 patients and collected all the T cell\nsubsets tests data. If multiple T cell subsets tests were performed, we chose the earliest one as\nthe baseline. Two researchers independently reviewed the collected data to ensure data\naccuracy.\nT cell subset test\nFor patients newly diagnosed with COVID-19 infection, 2 mL venous blood samples were\nobtained from each patient to measure T cell subsets. All analyses were completed within four\nFig 1. Process flow at the Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital.\nhttps://d oi.org/10.1371/j ournal.pon e.0239695.g0 01\nPLOS ONE\nA visualization tool using T cell subsets to evaluate COVID-19 patient’s severity\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02396 95 September 24, 2020 3 / 12\nhours of sampling in our hospital’s central lab. FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences,\nUSA) was used to determine the percentages and absolute counts of the following mature\nhuman lymphocyte subsets: T lymphocytes (CD3+), Helper/inducer T lymphocytes (CD3\n+CD4+), and Suppressor/cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD3+CD8+).\nSelection of analysis data\nThere have been a number of descriptive analyses about the epidemiological, clinical, labora-\ntory, and radiological characteristics of the COVID-19 patients [11–15]. Little as yet known\nabout how these characteristics can be used in guiding the practice of the healthcare providers\n[16, 17]. As the world face the expanding COVID-19 pandemic, with the number of infected\ncases increase exponentially every day, any quick and easy method of understanding the\npatient’s condition can be valuable. With this in mind we seek to build a statistical model with\nonly a few strong predictive characteristics. As several other research teams pointed out, the\npotential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 μg/L could\nhelp clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage [13]. Older patients\n(>65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death [18]. Additionally,\nduring our experience of treating the patients, we have noticed that the T cell subsets are\nclosely correlated to the patient’s progress. As the baseline T cell subsets tests were taken on\nthe first day of the patient’s hospitalization, we observed evidence of varying degrees of decline\nin T cell subsets at the hospitalization. And the patient’s condition further improved or wors-\nened with the rise or fall of the T cell subsets. We have also considered other immune indica-\ntors and inflammatory indicators, as well as the blood routine and lung CT, but they all have\ncertain limitations. Immune indicators and inflammatory indicators such as thyrotropin and\nwhite blood cells were not as sensitive as the T cell subsets. Thyroid stimulating hormone is a\nhormone secreted by the pituitary gland. On the one hand, it is affected by the promotion of\nthyroid stimulating hormone releasing hormone secreted by the hypothalamus, and on the\nother hand, it is affected by the feedback inhibitory effect of thyroid hormone. Thyroid stimu-\nlating hormone is mainly responsible for regulating thyroid cells. Proliferation, thyroid blood\nsupply, and thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion. The blood routine is not specific enough\nto differentiate the condition of the patients [19], and although lung CT is an accurate way to\nassess the patient’s condition, it cannot be repeated too often especially for those critical\npatients who needed oxygen and ventilator. In conclusion, we decided to focus our research\non patient’s age, underlying disease status, and the T cell subsets measures: Helper T cells, Sup-\npressor T cells, and TH/TSC (Helper T cells and Suppressor or cytotoxic T cells ratio).\nResults and discussion\nStatistical analysis results and the interactive web tool\nAmong the 310 discharged cases, the average age was 56.4 years (SD 14.0). 107 (34.5%) of\nthem had underlying diseases (the comorbidities as follows: hypertension, cardiovascular dis-\nease, COPD, diabetes, chronic liver disease). The average duration of the hospitalization was\n11.1 days (SD 6.94), and it took 15.1 days (SD 10.3) on average for them to reach our hospital\nsince their first symptoms. Among the 30 death cases, the average age was 69.0 years (SD 7.87).\n23 (76.7%) of them had underlying diseases. The average duration of the hospitalization was\n15.1 days (SD 8.78), and it took 11.7 days (SD 8.20) on average for them to reach our hospital\nsince their first symptoms (Table 1).\nFor the discharged cases, the summary statistics for their baseline T cell subsets tests are the\nfollowing: Total T cells percentage (mean 64.0%, SD 12.7%), Total T cells counts (mean 773,\nSD 549), Helper T cells percentage (37.2%, SD 10.6%), Helper T cells counts (mean 457, SD\nPLOS ONE\nA visualization tool using T cell subsets to evaluate COVID-19 patient’s severity\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02396 95 September 24, 2020 4 / 12\n342), Suppressor T cells percentage (mean 25.0%, SD 8.72%), Suppressor T cells counts (mean\n297, SD 220), TH/TSC (mean 1.71, SD 0.89), and Total Lymphocyte counts (mean 1160, SD\n744).\nFor the death cases, the summary statistics for their baseline T cell subsets tests are the fol-\nlowing: Total T cells percentage (mean 52.7%, SD 14.2%), Total T cells counts (mean 228, SD\n168), Helper T cells percentage (33.8%, SD 11.8%), Helper T cells counts (mean 139, SD 98),\nSuppressor T cells percentage (mean 17.3%, SD 8.72%), Suppressor T cells counts (mean 80.9,\nSD 97.7), TH/TSC (mean 2.41, SD 1.28), and Total Lymphocyte counts (mean 425, SD 254).\nMann Whitney U test between the discharged cases and the death cases in terms of their base-\nline T cell subsets measures yielded significant p values: Total T cells (p = 3.2e-10), Helper T\ncells (p = 3.1e-09), Suppressor T cells (p = 2.1e-11), and TH/TSC (p = 0.0007) suggesting that\npatients with a poor prognosis had a more damaged immune system at the time of hospitaliza-\ntion (Table 2).\nIn the scatterplots of the duration of hospitalization versus age, we can see that elderly\npatients tended to take longer to recover as shown by positive slopes, they also had a higher\nprobability to have underlying diseases (Fig 2A).

In order for our findings\nto be more applicable for public health workers fighting at the frontline, we have developed an\ninteractive web data visualization tool to implement the algorithm and made it accessible for\nthe world at the following web address: http://ec2-18-182-45-1 60.ap-northeast-1.compute.\namazonaws.com:3838/COV ID-19/.\nSimply by accessing to the web address and entering a new patient’s information, the UI\nwill show where the new patient is positioned (by a large blue dot) comparing to the reference\npanel of the 340 patients included in this research (S1 Fig).\nThis data visualization tool applied a k-means clustering method to detect the differentia-\ntion in their baseline profile patterns among all patients. K-means clustering is a type of unsu-\npervised learning method, enabling us to find and analyze the intrinsic underlying patient\nsubgroups without any pre-defined subgroup labels. Specifically, K-means clustering aims to\npartition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with\nTable 2.

In real-world scenarios, clustering is a widely used technique for customer\nsegmentation [21].\nIn our cluster analysis we aimed to partition n = 340 observations into k = 2 clusters, and\neach observation is a five-dimensional vector containing data from the following variables:\nage, underlying disease status, Helper T cells (log scale), Suppressor T cells (log scale), and the\nHelper T cells and Suppressor T cells ratio (log scale). These five variables were selected for the\nfollowing reasons: 1. Age, underlying disease status, Helper T cells, and TH/TSC were signifi-\ncant predictors in our multivariate logistic regression model. Although Suppressor T cells was\nnot statistically significant, it was used in the TH/TSC ratio. In fact a principal component\nanalysis [22] showed that all of the selected five indexes carry certain proportions of indepen-\ndent information (S2A Fig); 2. We did not use other lab tests such as the regular blood test\nitems in our analysis because they are less differentiative than the T cell subsets measures; and\n3. We hope our interactive web tool could be utilized for quick use, therefore keeping as few\ninput items as needed seems to be a more practical choice.\nS2B Fig shows the k-means clustering result using the Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital data.\nAfter multi-dimensional data transformation, the algorithm separates the death group and the\ndischarged group as shown in the graph. A proportion of the discharged cases had similar pro-\nfiles with the death cases, which had made it difficult for the algorithm to differentiate them\napart. However, by using this algorithm, it is possible to identify a large number of patients\nwith relatively good prognosis.\nWe have also uploaded a dummy date set with de-identified and randomly modified patient\ndata, as well as all the source code used for the current analysis as well as the interactive web\napplication to: https://github.com/mindy-f ang/COVID-19. All of our source code was written\nwith the R programming language and the interactive web application was developed with the\nFig 2.

Lymphopenia is a prominent part of SARS-CoV infection and lymphocyte\ncounts may be useful in predicting the severity and clinical outcomes [26], as 2019-nCoV was\ncalled earlier Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-20) [27]. The\nlevel and the speed of T cell recovery are important factors of assessing disease prognoses and\nguiding early intervention in critically ill patients. The study purposes includes:1, we have iden-\ntified that older age, underlying diseases, and lower T cell counts may be risk factors for poor\nclinical outcomes in COVID-10 positive patients; 2, We have also implemented an interactive\nweb tool to visualize a new patient’s risk using these risk factors. 3, Another important signifi-\ncance of our tool is the monitoring of patient’s progress in real time during the treatment. For\nexample, if we take repeated measures of the patient’s T cell subsets test and visualize the\npatient’s relative position with our app, the patient’s relative position as shown in the app gradu-\nally shifting towards the red centroid (poor outcome) or the green centroid (good outcome)\nmay provide insight on the patient’s progress (S1 Fig). This feature can help clinicians to evalu-\nate the condition of a new patient and to ring alarm for critically ill patients.\nIt should be noted that our intension is not for the web tool to be considered as a 100% gold\nstandard for determining the final clinical outcome of the patients. The actual final prognosis\nof a patient depends on many other factors, including the time of treatment initiation, adher-\nence to treatment, and extent of treatment. The visualization result simply suggests whether\nthe new patient is more likely to recover or to have adverse outcomes.\nOur algorithm has the following limitations: It may not predict accurately for younger\npatients, or patients with no symptoms, since our training data contains relatively senior and\nsevere patients; Secondly, the model was built based on a sample size of 340, which is not a\nlarge number. When we collected our data, 229 patients still remained in hospitalization, so we\nexcluded them for lack of definite clinical outcome. As the early phase of the COVID-19 out-\nbreak, we did not fully realize the importance of the T cell subgroup test so 152 patients did\nnot have the test data. But we will keep updating our web application as we collect more data\nFig 4.

We expect more findings about the underlying mechanism of the dis-\nease to be published by other researchers, including how the virus infects the body, how the\nbody reacts to the infection, how the infection changes the vital status, and so on. We are also\ndoing an exploratory research using other biomarkers such as interleukin-6, and other surro-\ngate clinical outcomes such as oxygen-free survival time.\nIn addition, the reference panel used in our analysis were infected population in Wuhan,\nChina. Although there was no clear evidence that the underlying mechanism of the T cell\ndepletion under the COVID-19 infection is similar or different across ethnicity groups, it is\nonly natural to assume that the baseline values and the degree of T cell depletion would be\nslightly different. In fact, there had already been evidences that the T-lymphocytes, B-lympho-\ncytes, and NK cells differ among people in different regions [28–33]. We encourage research-\ners around the world to download the source code and customize it with their own data,\nadding more clinical characteristics and biomarkers as they accumulate more experience and\nknowledge with patients from their own hospitals or regions.\nConclusions\nOur study has found that elderly patients with underlying diseases, lower T cell subsets counts\nmay have a high risk of poor prognosis for COVID-19 infection. Our web visualization tool\nwas used at Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital to serve as a quick assessment for a patient’s risk at\nthe time of examination and to keep a close monitoring of the patient’s condition change in a\ntimely manner. However, in order for the tool to be practically useful for other research teams\nor hospitals, further development and customization of the web tool is warranted by adding\nmore clinical characteristics and biomarkers.\nSupporting information\nS1 Fig. Screen shots of the interactive web tool. a) A 60 year old patient with underlying dis-\neases, displayed by the large blue square, showing a critical condition with Helper T cell counts\nof 100 and Suppressor T cell counts of 100. b) The same patient showing improved condition,\nwith Helper T cell counts increased to 600 and Suppressor T cell counts increased to 500.\n(TIF)\nS2 Fig. Principal component analysis and cluster analysis. a) The three selected T-cell sub-\nsets indexes and age, underlying disease indicator were plotted against their first two principal\ncomponents, which carries 45.42% and 23.56% of the total information respectively.

There was very little overlap among the six variables\nsuggesting them carrying exclusive information. b) Multi-dimensional transformation of the\nabove five variables for the 340 patients in our study, so that the underlying patterns can be\nrecognized to the maximum extent.
