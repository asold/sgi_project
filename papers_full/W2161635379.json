Locals say that crows were\nintroduced to Mare´ from Grande Terre around 1900 as a bi-\nological control for the large endemic katydids (Pseudophyllanax\nimperialis) that were destroying coconut trees (pers. comms. to\nGRH).\nCrows stand out amongst nonhuman animals because of their\nability to both manufacture and use tools in seemingly sophisti-\ncated ways to extract small prey from vegetation. For example,\nthey are the only species other than humans known to create and\nuse hook tools [2]. In fact, they produce two distinct types of hook\ntool: those made from live twigs and similar stick-like material\n[2,3], and those made from the barbed edges ofPandanus spp.\nleaves [2,4].\nPandanus tool technology is unique in providing an artefactual\nrecord of tool manufacture at any point in time extending back\nseveral years [1]. This is because the exact shape of a manufactured\ntool remains on the edge of a leaf from which it was removed in\nthe form of a ‘counterpart’. Pandanus tool counterparts, or the\nsections of missing leaf edge, thus allow a quantitative description\nof the shapes of pandanus tools and the frequency with which they\nare made at any particular location. Pandanus tool manufacture\noccurs throughout Grande Terre and Mare´, especially in inland\nforests little disturbed by humans [5]. The analysis of tool\ncounterparts on Grande Terre has revealed interesting variation\nbetween sites in the shapes and varieties of pandanus tools made\n[5]. The shape of a particular variety of pandanus tool is generally\nhighly standardised at sites (e.g. the number of ‘steps’ on stepped\ntools) [5], but these standard shapes can vary considerably\nbetween sites [1,5]. This shape structure is especially evident for\nstepped tools on Grande Terre. There are no obvious environ-\nmental correlates (e.g. altitude, location) to explain the variation in\nthe stepped design.\nA crucial question is what causes the population variation in\nNew Caledonian crows’ pandanus tool manufacture and use?\nJuvenile crows have an inherited disposition for basic stick tool use\n[6], but there is no evidence that they have such a disposition to\nmake pandanus tools. Indeed, Huntet al. [7] proposed that the\ndisposition for basic stick tool use combined with learning is crucial\nfor the development of pandanus tool skills in the wild. Work on\nthe island of Mare´ found that juveniles were raised for an extended\nperiod of time (at least up to the next breeding season) in a close\nfamily relationship [8]. Juveniles’ tool skills primarily developed in\ntheir first year of life in a learning environment strongly scaffolded\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 May 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 5 | e36608\nby their parents [8]. This type of social system minimises the\npotential for horizontal transmission of tool information via social\nlearning and promotes its vertical transmission. A reliance on\nvertical transmission should see a close correlation between the\nspread of tool skills and gene flow. That is, dispersal with successful\nreproduction (effective dispersal) would be required as opposed to\nineffective dispersal combined with only horizontal transmission.\nTherefore, the spread of tool skills in the New Caledonian crow\nmay be closely correlated with both gene flow and dispersal\ndynamics.\nGenetic, social and ecological aspects may all play a role in\nbringing about the observed variation in crows’ pandanus tool\nskills. An important first step in teasing apart the roles of these\nthree components would be describing the genetic structure of the\nNew Caledonian crow. Finding significant genetic structure\nassociated with variation in a particular behaviour does not\nnecessarily mean that it develops without learning. However, it\nraises the possibility that genetic dissimilarity might play a role in\ncausing the variation [9]. Deciphering the New Caledonian crow’s\ngenetic structure over its geographical range might help us to (1)\nformulate hypotheses about the cause of pandanus tool variation\nbetween locations, and (2) target appropriate areas for future,\nintensive behavioural and genetic studies. Here, we provide the\nfirst description of population genetic structure across the New\nCaledonian crow’s geographical range and discuss the possible\nimplications of our findings for explaining the population\ndifferences in crows’ tool manufacture and use.\nMaterial and Methods\nCollection of DNA Samples\nWe extracted DNA from feathers plucked from New Caledo-\nnian crows throughout their range (figure 1). Feather samples were\ncollected from 48 crows on mainland Grande Terre\n(.16,000 km\n2) across nine sites, which were spread over the\nisland (figure 1). Of the 48 crows, 45 were captured in the wild\nusing a ‘whoosh’ net then immediately released after feather\nsamples were taken. Feathers were also taken from two dead crows\nfound freshly shot by hunters (site 5 in figure 1). The remaining\ncrow was a captive bird in Parc Zoo Forestier, Noume´a that was\ncaught as a chick (site 9 in figure 1; see also [7]). We also collected\nfeathers from eight crows captured on the small inshore island of\nToupe´ti (ca. 5 km\n2 in area) on the south east side of Grande Terre\n(site 8 in figure 1). Toupe´ti is separated from Grande Terre by\na narrow sea channel approximately 80 m wide. On Mare´, we\ncollected feathers from 80 crows in the southern part of the island\n(site 11 in figure 1). Mare´ is ca. 642 km\n2 in area and is situated\n110 km to the east of Grande Terre.\nOn Grande Terre we sampled crows at sites that varied with\nrespect to habitat and associated tool-making behaviour. For\ncalculations based on local frequencies the sample size at sites had\nto be at least five (10 alleles) (this was the case at 5 of the 9 Grande\nTerre sites: sites 1, 2, 6, 7 and 10 in figure 1). The five crows at\nPanie´ (site 1) were caught 20 m from the beach, but there was\na forest nearby in which Pandanus spp. trees grew. We caught\nFigure 1. Map of New Caledonia with sample locations.Location of the 11 sites on the islands of Grande Terre, Toupe´ti and Mare´ where crow\nfeathers were collected. The samples sizes (n) are the numbers of individual crows sampled at the sites.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0036608.g001\nGenetic Structure in New Caledonian Crows\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 May 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 5 | e36608\n10 crows at Taven (site 2) in inland forest wherePandanus spp.\ntrees were absent. The 14 crows at Bourail (site 6) were also caught\nclose to the sea, at the foot of hills where candlenut trees (Aleurites\nmoluccana) were common. Crows in candlenut tree areas use tools\nyear round to extract large wood-boring grubs from dead\ncandlenut wood [3,10]. Site 7 (Sarrame´a) was also in a candlenut\ntree area, but inland in the central mountain chain. The last\nmainland site (10) was in Parc Rivie`re Bleue where crows were\nknown to make pandanus tools [5]. All 48 samples from the nine\nsites on Grande Terre were used in individual-based calculations\nor calculations making no a priori assumptions on groupings of\nindividuals. Most of the crows that we sampled came from lower\naltitudes because birds at higher altitudes in forest occur at lower\ndensities and are particularly difficult to catch.\nFeather samples were stored in 80% ethanol prior to DNA\nextraction. DNA was extracted using a Dneasy Blood and Tissue\nkit (Qiagen Company). To maximise the recovery of DNA, the\ntubes containing the feathers were centrifuged at 3000 g for\n5 mins. Ethanol was then removed and the tubes were inverted on\na bench to dry. The pelleted material was then re-suspended in\n50 ml of water and added to the buffer/proteinase K mix, along\nwith the feather tips cut into pieces. DNA was finally re-suspended\nin a 50ml volume of T.E.\nGenotyping\nWe used nine microsatellite markers that we had previously\noptimised to reliably genotype New Caledonian crows [11]. Six of\nthese markers (Ck.1B6G, Ck.2A5A, Ck.5A5G, Ck.4A3G,\nCk.5A5F, Ck.4B6D) were developed for the Mariana crow, C.\nkubaryi [12], and the remaining three (CoBr02, CoBr09, CoBr12)\nfor the American crow, C. brachyrhynchos [13]. PCRs were\nperformed in 96-well plates using a TETRAD thermal cycler\n(MJ Research). The cycling profile consisted of a touchdown PCR\nwith one cycle at 94u for 12 mins, 10 cycles of 15 s at 94u,1 5sa t\n65u, 15 s at 72u, followed by 30 cycles of 15 s at 94u,1 5 sa t\na temperature starting at 65u and decreasing by 0.5u every cycle,\nand 15 s at 72 u. Finally, a 12 min step of elongation was\nconducted at 72u. Reactions were performed in a volume of 10mL\nand contained 2 to 20 ng of genomic DNA, 0.04mM of Taq\npolymerase, 1X Buffer, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTP and\n0.3 mM of each of forward and reverse primers. The forward\nprimer was modified at the 59 end by the addition of a fluorescent\nlabel (6-Fam, VIC, NED, PET; Applied Biosystems). Labelled\nPCR products were analysed on an ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic\nAnalyser (Applied Biosystems), and allele sizes were estimated\nusing the Genescan 500 LIZ size standard (Applied Biosystems) in\nthe program GENEMAPPER version 3.7 (Applied Biosystems).\nStatistical Analysis\nWe used neutral genetic markers to investigate genetic structure\nin the New Caledonian crow in order to see how genetic variation\nis structured geographically and to what degree gene flow exists\nbetween populations (i.e. dispersal).\nThe presence of null alleles was tested following Chapuis &\nEstoup [14] using software FreeNA. To evaluate the level of\ngenotyping error, 10% of the samples were genotyped twice. The\npower of our set of loci to discriminate individuals was assessed\nthrough the estimation of the probability of identity (PI) using\nGenalex 6 [15]. To have a first grouping hypothesis for our\ndataset, a clustering analysis was conducted without anya priori\nassumptions on population delimitation. The most likely number\nof population units (K) in the complete dataset (Grande Terre,\nMare´ and Toupe´ti) was inferred using a fully Bayesian clustering\nmethod as implemented in STRUCTURE 2.3.2 [16]. The\nprogram was run three times for each value ofK varying from 1\nto 6. We used a classical model with admixture withouta priori\ninformation on population membership with correlated frequen-\ncies. Although these models make it easier to distinguish closely\nrelated populations, there is a risk of overestimatingK [17]. After\npreliminary tests of the convergence time needed for the Monte-\nCarlo Markov chain, we chose a burn-in period of 100,000 steps\nfollowed by 900,000 steps. The most likely value for K was\nestimated using Evanno’sDK method [18] using STRUCTURE\nHARVESTER [19].\nBased on the results of this grouping method, standard genetic\nparameters such as allele frequencies, mean number of alleles per\nlocus and heterozygosity were calculated to estimate genetic\ndiversity. These parameters were computed using the software\nGENALEX 6 [15]. To correct allelic diversity for difference in\nsample size, we also calculated allelic richness with Fstat 2.9.3.2\n[20], which uses resampling methods based on the smallest\nnumber of samples. We performed an exact test of Hardy-\nWeinberg proportions when there were fewer than five alleles per\nlocus. For five or more alleles, we conducted an unbiased estimate\nof the exact probability with the Markov chain method of Guo and\nThompson [21] for each combination of locus and population\nusing GENEPOP software version 3.3 [22]. We used the\nsequential Bonferroni method to adjust critical significance levels\nfor simultaneous statistical tests [23] with a nominal significance\nlevel of 5%.\nWe estimated the level of genetic variation between sample sites\nwith at least five samples using Jost’sD. We used Jost’sD rather\nthan the classical Fst because it is more rigorous at taking into\naccount differences in heterozygosity between sites [24]. The level\nof significance of Jost’sD values was tested using bootstrapping\nmethods with resampling ( n = 1000). These calculations were\ncarried out using the R package DEMEtics [25]. For complete-\nness, we also provide Fst values to readily enable comparison with\nother studies given the widespread use of this statistic.\nTo test for isolation by distance on Grande Terre, we used\na Mantel test withD as a measure of genetic divergence (tests were\nalso conducted with Fst for comparison) and conducted all\ncombinations of normal and log-transformed distances. The\nsignificance of theZ statistics was estimated through a randomi-\nzation procedure (1000 randomizations). Moreover, the strength\nof the correlation (r\n2) was estimated using a Reduced Major Axis\nregression. These calculations were performed using IBDWS [26].\nWe also used the Mantel test to see if there was any\ngeographical pattern in the shapes of stepped pandanus tools that\nmight mirror variation in genetic structure (low numbers of sites\nprevented us testing for geographical patterns in the shapes of wide\nand narrow pandanus tools). Specifically, we tested if distance\nbetween sites where stepped tools were made on Grande Terre\nwas correlated with variation in the mean length of these tools\nbetween the sites. We used 18 of the stepped tool collection sites\nwith adequate samples sizes described in Hunt & Gray [5] for the\nanalysis (sites 1–14 & 16–19). We measured the distance between\nsites on a 1:500,000 map. The test was carried out with the\nfunction mantel.rtest from the R library ade4. Thep-value was\nobtained using permutation methods with 1000 replicates.\nWe also conducted analyses to determine the genetic relation-\nship between the crow populations on Grande Terre, Toupe´ti and\nMare´. We compared the number and identity of alleles for each\nlocus between the two islands to see if Grande Terre was a likely\nsource for the crow population on Mare´. We then tested different\ncolonisation scenarios involving the three islands with Approxi-\nmate Bayesian Computation methods (ABC) using software\nDIYABC v1.0 [27]. Four scenarios were considered. Scenario\nGenetic Structure in New Caledonian Crows\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 May 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 5 | e36608\none postulated Grande Terre as the source of independent\ncolonisations of Toupe´ti and Mare´, with a time constraint for the\nlater corresponding to a putative single introduction event around\n1900 (i.e. 30 to 50 generations for the crows). The second scenario\nwas similar to the first one, but the colonisation event from Grande\nTerre to Mare´ was not time constrained. The third scenario tested\nthe possibility of multiple introductions from Grande Terre to\nMare´; to do this we allowed a second colonisation event. Finally,\nthe fourth scenario involved a linear colonisation sequence first\nfrom Grande Terre to Toupe´ti, then from Toupe´ti to Mare´. The\ndetails of the scenarios and parameters used for these analyses are\nin electronic figure S1. For ease and clarity, the different steps of\nthe ABC analysis are presented jointly with the results in the\nResults section.\nResults\nPopulation Delimitation and Genetic Diversity\nClustering analysis conducted on the whole dataset indicates\nthat the most likely number of distinct genetic entities isK =3 ,\napproximately representing the islands of Grande Terre, Mare´\nand Toupe´ti (figure 2). The analysis indicated an increased\nlikelihood untilK = 3, before decreasing (figure 2a). A higher value\nis obtained for K = 2 with Evanno’sDK (figure 2b). For K =2 ,\nSTRUCTURE clearly separates Grande Terre and Toupe´ti crows\nfrom those on Mare´ (data not shown). For K = 3, crows from\nToupe´ti are separated from those on Grande Terre (figure 3).\nFrom these results we chooseK = 3 as the hypothesis for the main\npopulation groupings for three reasons: (1) Evanno’s method is\nknown for underestimating K [28], (2) individuals from Toupe´ti\nare clearly distinct when increasingK from 2 to 3, and (3) the mean\nlikelihood gives an optimal value forK =3 .\nNo significant null alleles were detected in the three populations\n(Grande Terre, Toupe´ti and Mare´). Moreover, the probability of\nidentity dropped under 10\n23 for as few as five loci. Genotyping\nerrors were low and approximate zero. We found no discrepancies\nin the 10% of the data that were genotyped twice to test for errors.\nGlobal departures from Hardy-Weinberg (table 1) were detected\non Grande Terre and Mare´, but were due to a restricted number\nof loci in both cases (i.e. only one and three loci, respectively,\nshowed heterozygote deficiency). The mean number of alleles per\nlocus was higher on Grande Terre than on both Mare ´ and\nToupe´ti (5.78, 5 and 2.44, respectively). This situation was still\nobserved when correcting for the difference in sample sizes, as\nshown by allelic richness (3.78, 3.55 and 2.4, respectively). When\ncomparing only allelic richness between Grande Terre and Mare´,\nthus aligning sample sizes on Grande Terre (n = 40) rather than on\nToupe´ti (n = 8), the difference in genetic diversity increases (5.8\nand 4.6, respectively). Ten private alleles were found on Grande\nTerre, three on Mare´ and none on Toupe´ti.\nGenetic Differentiation and Isolation by Distance\nTo quantify the level of genetic differentiation in the New\nCaledonian crows that we sampled, we computed Jost’sD between\neach pair of the five sites that had at least five samples (table 2).\nOnly two comparisons (Panie´ vs Taven: D = 0.01; Panie´v s\nBourail: D = 0.048) were not significantly different. Excluding\nToupe´ti, values of differentiation on Grande Terre ranged from\n0.085 to 0.199. Comparisons between Toupe ´ti and the five\nGrande Terre sites showed higher values ranging from 0.316 to\n0.504. These values are even higher than that obtained for the\ncomparison between Mare´ and the Grande Terre sites, which\nranged from 0.13 to 0.358. The highest value of genetic\ndivergence was between Mare´ and Toupe´ti (0.519).\nWe also tested for isolation by distance using the five Grande\nTerre sites with larger sample sizes and Toupe´ti (table 3). When\nToupe´ti was excluded, isolation by distance is significant for all\ncombinations of distances and log-tranformed distances (r\n2 values\nranged from 0.321 to 0.499). When Toupe´ti is included, isolation\nby distance is only significant when both distances are log-\ntransformed, resulting in a lower r2 (0.246). Similar results are\nobtained when using Fst as a measure of genetic distance rather\nthan Jost’s D (data not shown). These results indicate two\nimportant findings: (1) a correlation between geographical\nseparation and genetic similarity exists on Grande Terre, and (2)\nthe crow population on Toupe´ti does not fit well into this\nFigure 2.

First, we built a reference table with one million\nsimulated datasets for each scenario, with the default mutation\nmodels for microsatellites corresponding to a GSM. All one sample\nsummary statistics were used, along with Fst and the classification\nindex. The adequacy between the scenarios and the priors, as\ndefined in table 4, was evaluated through a principal component\nanalysis (PCA) of the first 100 000 simulated datasets of the\nreference table in the space of summary statistics. The observed\ndataset was clearly surrounded by simulated data sets, indicating\nthat our model was able to produce data sets similar to the\nobserved one (data not shown).\nWe compared scenarios by computing their posterior probabil-\nities using a logistic regression approach based on the best 40,000\ndatasets (1%). The logistic regression favoured scenario 1 (i.e.\nindependent colonisations from Grande Terre to Toupe´ti and\nMare´, with a constraint on the colonisation time of Mare´a t\naround 1900; table 5), closely followed by scenario 2 (p = 0.383\nand p = 0.347, respectively). Scenario 2 provides the same\ncolonisation pattern as scenario one, but with a larger time\nconstraint (0 to 1000 generations instead of 30 to 50). We next\nestimated the posterior distribution of the parameters used in our\nmodel (table 4). We have not undertaken a detailed examination of\nthese posterior distributions, as their 95% credibility intervals were\nrelatively large. Nevertheless, they indicate that the colonisation of\nToupe´ti took place before crows arrived on Mare´. Also, the mean\nof the posterior probability for the colonisation on Mare´ when the\ntime constraint is relaxed (t1 in scenario 2, data not shown) still\nstays close toteuro with a mean of 67 generations even though it\ncould potentially have had a value from 1 to 1000. The estimation\nof NM1 (i.e. the mean number of individuals post-introduction on\nMare´) is relatively large at more than 200 individuals.\nWe evaluated the goodness-of-fit of scenario 1 by simulating\n10,000 datasets under scenario 1 followed by a PCA. This enabled\nus to verify that the observed data set was well within the range of\nvalues obtained through the previous simulations (data not shown).\nFinally, we evaluated the confidence in scenario choice by\nestimating type I and type II errors. We first computed 100\ndatasets under each competing scenario (i.e. a total of 400). Then\nwe calculated (1) the number of times scenario 1 did not have the\nhighest posterior probability when it was the true scenario (Type I\nerror), and (2) the number of times scenario 1 had the highest\nposterior probability when the true scenario was either scenarios 2,\n3 or 4 (type II error). The results suggested that our methodology\nto discriminate between the four competing scenarios was rigorous\n(type I error rate was 0.08 and the mean type II error rate was\n0.032).\nDiscussion\nUsing nine neutral markers, we conducted the first study of the\npopulation genetic structure of the tool-using New Caledonian\ncrow over its geographical range. Our analyses produced four\nmain findings: (1) significant genetic differentiation between sites\non Grande Terre, (2) a general signal of isolation by distance on\nGrande Terre, (3) populations on the islands of Grande Terre,\nToupe´ti and Mare´ are distinct genetic entities, and (4) confirma-\ntion that both Toupe´ti and Mare´ populations were founded from\nGrande Terre.\nOur finding that crows on Mare´ are significantly genetically\ndifferentiated from those on Grande Terre was not unexpected\ngiven the 110 km of open water between the two islands that\nshould have prevented the birds mixing. The genetic composition\nof the Mare´ population is almost a strict sub-sample of the genetic\ndiversity found on Grande Terre, however. Our colonisation\nscenario analysis is also in agreement with the anecdotal evidence\nthat birds were introduced to Mare´ from the mainland after\nEuropean colonization began ca. 1850 [29]. Nevertheless, the level\nof genetic diversity on Mare´ is still relatively high, with our\nscenario testing suggesting that a mean of over 200 individuals was\nnecessary to explain the current genetic diversity of Mare´ crows.\nThis number of founders seems quite unlikely and should be seen\nFigure 3.

Despite\ncrows’ ability to fly, the genetic data suggests that the birds on\nToupe´ti rarely mix with those on Grande Terre. New Caledonian\ncrows are tropical forest birds and as such may be extremely\nreluctant to cross even a narrow expanse of open water [30]. That\nsuch a small population of crows very close to Grande Terre can\napparently remain so isolated is surprising, especially if the current\npopulation arrived before crows were introduced to Mare´ around\n100 years ago, as our colonisation analyses suggests.\nA recent study by Rutzet al.[31] on crows from the central west\ncoast of Grande Terre has also shown a significant level of genetic\ndifferentiation for locations only a few kilometres apart. While the\nFst values they observe are low (but significant) and compatible\nwith the larger values we observe at a larger scale, it is surprising\nthat given their findings we do not detect clear boundaries\nbetween populations at a larger scale using similar clustering\nmethods. The different findings of the two studies are likely\nexplained by two key factors. First, an over-representation of\nrelated individuals in the Rutzet al. [31] study may have resulted\nin an over-estimation of the number of clusters (intensive sampling\nwas conducted in limited areas). Second, the relatively small\nsample sizes for each location in our study might have decreased\nthe power of the clustering algorithm resulting in us only being\nable to detect the most differentiated groups of individuals (i.e.\nGrande Terre; Toupe´ti and Mare´).\nNonetheless, both studies suggest that genetic structure may\nexist at fine-scales in New Caledonian crows. Rutz et al. suggest\nthat the genetic structure they found demonstrates the potential for\ngenetic and/or cultural isolation to cause variation in tool skills\nbetween crow populations. However, caution is needed in\nextrapolating the genetic structure between their three sites to\nthe Grande Terre as a whole. This is because only one of their\nthree sites was in forest habitat; the other two sites (farmland and\nholiday settlement) were highly human modified habitat. Dispersal\ndynamics of crows between human modified and forest habitat is\nlikely to be different from the dynamics within forest. Most of our\nsampling sites with five or more crows were in forest habitat. Small\nsample sizes, though, means that we cannot conclude that fine-\nscale genetic structure is absent in forest crows on Grande Terre.\nImportantly, in spite of small sample sizes we found weak isolation\nby distance in forest where the majority of tool manufacture by\ncrows occurs.\nThe isolation by distance effect that we found enables us to\nmake inferences about the social system of tool making crows in\nforest habitat on Grande Terre. It suggests that the species’ social\nsystem and dispersal behaviour even more than environmental\nboundaries (e.g. mountains, deforested areas) are responsible for\npatterns of gene flow. A field study on Mare´ [32] found that mated\npairs lived year round on permanent foraging ranges that often\noverlapped with those of other mated pairs. Juveniles developed\ntheir tool skills in their first year in a learning environment highly\nscaffolded by parents [8] and second-year juveniles sometimes\ndelayed dispersal from their natal area [32,33]. There is no\nevidence that New Caledonian crows are cooperative breeders\nthough [32], which would explain why some older juveniles delay\ndispersal. The correlation of geographic distance and genetic\ndifferentiation on Grande Terre indicates: (1) restricted effective\ndispersal between crow populations, and (2) effective dispersal is\nmore frequently over relatively short distances than over large\ndistances. This suggests that crows on the mainland probably have\na very similar kind of social system to those on Mare´ that came\nfrom Grande Terre [32]. That is, dispersal mostly occurs only\nlocally when juveniles find partners and establish home ranges\ngenerally close to their natal areas. Such a social system would\nfacilitate population level specialization of tool skills by both\ngenetic and cultural effects.\nThe patterns of gene flow that we found on Grande Terre do\nnot allow us to make inferences about the reasons for the\ngeographical variation in crows’ tool skills. However, the gene flow\nand the likely closely associated dispersal dynamics of crows on\nTable 2.Genetic differentiation measured by Jost’sD (above diagonal) between pairs of locations with at least five samples.\n1.Panie´ 2.Taven 6.Bourail 7.Sarrame ´a 8.Toupe ´ti 10.Parc R.B. 11.Mare ´\n1.Panie´ – 0.001 0.048 0.085 0.503 0.167 0.13\n2.Taven 0.008 – 0.198 0.118 0.503 0.197 0.218\n6.Bourail 0.025 0.127 – 0.101 0.504 0.199 0.229\n7.Sarrame´a 0.079 0.090 0.057 – 0.316 0.091 0.174\n8.Toupe´ti 0.313 0.310 0.271 0.226 – 0.345 0.519\n10.Parc R.B. 0.155 0.184 0.110 0.077 0.236 – 0.358\n11.Mare´ 0.081 0.113 0.113 0.082 0.260 0.176 –\nFst values are indicated below diagonal.\nValues in bold are significantly greater than zero (p value ,0.05).\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0036608.t002\nTable 3.Correlation between genetic (Jost’sD) and\ngeographic distances on Grande Terre with and without\nToupe´ti.\nwith Toupe´ti without Toupe ´ti\nanalyses pr 2 pr 2\nGendist/GeoDist 0.189 0.044 0.048 0.323\nGendist/Log(GeoDist) 0.111 0.061 0.039 0.375\nLog(Gendist)/GeoDist 0.056 0.142 0.031 0.321\nLog(Gendist)/\nLog(GeoDist)\n0.02 0.246 0.031 0.499\nThe strength of the correlation (r2) is estimated using reduced major axis\nregression and the significance (p) of theZ statistics is evaluated through\nrandomization procedure.

The finding of a significant\ncorrelation between geographical distance and genetic differenti-\nation is especially interesting. If learning has a limited role in what\nkind of tool skills develop in a young crow, then we would also\npredict a correlation between geographical distance and dissim-\nilarity of tool skills. Intriguingly, this does not appear to be the case\nin crows’ pandanus tool manufacture, where raw material has little\neffect on final tool shape [5]. We found no geographical distance\neffect on the mean length of stepped tools at sites to mirror the\nisolation by distance effect in the genetic structure of crows that we\nsampled on Grande Terre. Langergraber and Vigilent [9] stress\nthat ‘‘…it is only when patterns of genetic and behavioural\ndissimilarity are discordant that we can make inferences about the\nprocesses (genetic or cultural) responsible for between-group\nvariation in behaviour’’. The genetic and behavioural data that\nwe analysed here were unrelated. Nevertheless, the lack of\na geographical pattern in the shapes of stepped pandanus tools\nenables us to suggest that the genetic structure of pandanus tool\nmaking crows may not be closely associated with the geographical\nvariation in the shapes of pandanus tools. This further raises the\npossibility that learning may play an important role in bringing\nabout the geographical variation in the shapes of these tools [5].\nOur work emphasizes the need for detailed behavioural,\necological and genetic data to untangle the processes and\nmechanisms responsible for the variation in crows’ tool skills.\nRecent work on chimpanzees clearly shows that such data needs to\ninvestigate patterns of genetic and behavioural dissimilarity\nassociated with individual behaviours [9,34,35]. Increasing sample\nsizes at existing sites and adding new sites will be an important step\nin identifying promising locations for these intensive studies in the\nfuture. For example, a more comprehensive data set might reveal\n‘mainland islands’ of genetic distinctness similar to Toupe´ti on\nGrande Terre. Detailed genetic and behavioural studies might\nthen target populations in close proximity with obviously different\ntool skills where the variation cannot be easily explained by\necological factors. Looking at selected genes potentially linked to\nparticular behaviours rather than using neutral markers would also\nenable researchers to better investigate relationships between\ngenetics and behaviour. For example, it has been shown that\npolymorphism in ‘personality genes’ such as the dopamine\nreceptor D4 (DRD4) appears to be associated with inter-individual\ndifferences in exploratory behaviours in a variety of species\nranging from humans to the great tit (Parus major) [36].
