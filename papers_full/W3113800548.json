ERC is a task to predict the emotion of the\ncurrent utterance expressed by a speciﬁc speaker according\nto the context (Poria et al. 2019b), which is more challenging\nthan the conventional emotion recognition only considering\nsemantic information of an independent utterance.\nTo precisely predict the emotion of a targeted utterance,\nboth the semantic information of the utterance and the in-\nformation provided by utterances in the context are criti-\ncal. Nowadays, a number of works (Hazarika et al. 2018a,b;\nMajumder et al. 2019; Ghosal et al. 2019) demonstrate\nthat the interactions between speakers can facilitate extract-\ning information from contextual utterances. We denote this\nkind of information with modeling speakers’ interactions as\nCopyright © 2021, Association for the Advancement of Artiﬁcial\nIntelligence (www.aaai.org).

To capture speaker-\naware contextual information, the state-of-the-art model Di-\nalogueGCN (Ghosal et al. 2019) introduces Self and Inter-\nSpeaker dependencies, which capture the inﬂuences from\ndifferent speakers. As illustrated in Fig. 1 (a), Self and Inter-\nSpeaker dependencies establish a speciﬁc relation between\nevery two speakers and construct a fully connected relational\ngraph. And then a Relational Graph Convolutional Network\n(RGCN) (Schlichtkrull et al. 2018) is applied to process such\na graph.\nAlthough DialogueGCN can achieve excellent perfor-\nmance with Self and Inter-Speaker dependencies, this\nspeaker modeling is easy to be complicated with the number\nof speakers increasing. As shown in Fig. 1 (b), for a con-\nversation clip with two speakers, the considered relations\nreach to 7. The number can drastically increase with more\nspeakers involved. Thus this complicated speaker modeling\nis hard to deal with the condition that the number of speak-\ners dynamically changes, and not ﬂexible to be deployed in\nother models. In addition, RGCN processing the fully con-\nnected graph with multiple relations requires tremendous\narXiv:2012.14781v1  [cs.CL]  29 Dec 2020\nconsumption of computation. This limitation leads to Dia-\nlogueGCN only considering the local context in a conversa-\ntion (Ghosal et al. 2019). Therefore, it is appealing to intro-\nduce a simple and general speaker modeling, which is easy\nto extend in all scenes and realize in other models so that\nlong-distance context can be available.\nTo address the above problem, we propose a TRans-\nforMer with Speaker Modeling (TRMSM). First, we sim-\nplify the Self and Inter-speaker dependencies to a binary\nversion, which only contains two relations: Intra-Speaker\ndependency and Inter-Speaker dependency. As illustrated\nin Fig. 1, for the speaker of the targeted utterance, Intra-\nSpeaker dependency focuses on the inﬂuence from the same\nspeaker, and Inter-Speaker dependency treats other speakers\nas a whole group instead of building a relation between ev-\nery two speakers. In this way, our simpliﬁed modeling can\nbe easy to extend in other models and deal with the scene\nwith the dynamical number of speakers without introducing\nnew relations between speakers.\nFurthermore, with the ability to settle long-distance de-\npendency, Transformer (Vaswani et al. 2017) achieves ex-\ncellent performance among a great number of Natural Lan-\nguage Processing (NLP) problems. To better model the long-\ndistance contextual utterances in a conversation, we uti-\nlize a hierarchical Transformer with two levels: sentence\nlevel and dialogue level. In the sentence level, BERT (De-\nvlin et al. 2019) encodes the semantic representation for a\ntargeted utterance, and in the dialogue level, Transformer\nis used to capture the information from contextual utter-\nances. To better model our simpliﬁed dependencies in the\ndialogue-level Transformer, we design three masks: Con-\nventional Mask for conventional context modeling, Intra-\nSpeaker Mask for Intra-Speaker dependency, and Inter-\nSpeaker Mask for Inter-Speaker dependency. To realize the\nfunctions of masks, we deploy three independent Trans-\nformer blocks in dialogue level and the designed masks are\nrespectively used in these Transformer blocks. With differ-\nent speaker-aware contextual information extracted by these\nTransformer blocks, whose contributions to the ﬁnal predic-\ntion are diverse, we utilize the attention mechanism to au-\ntomatically weight and fuse them. Besides, we also apply\ntwo other simple fusing methods: Add and Concatenation to\ndemonstrate the advancement of the attention.\nSpeciﬁcally, our contributions are concluded as follows:\n• We simplify Self and Inter-speaker dependencies to a bi-\nnary version, so that the speaker interaction modeling can\nbe extended in hierarchical Transformer and the long-\ndistance context can be considered.\n• We design three types of masks to achieve speakers’ in-\nteractions modeling in Transformer and utilize the atten-\ntion mechanism to automatically pick up the important\nspeaker-aware contextual information.\n• We conduct experiments on two ERC datasets: IEMO-\nCAP and MELD. Our method achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on both datasets on average.\nRelated Work\nTwo aspects are strongly related to our work: Emotion\nrecognition in conversation and Utilization of mask in Trans-\nformer.\nEmotion recognition in conversation Hierarchical\nstructure based on RNN (Jiao, Lyu, and King 2020; Jiao\net al. 2019) or Transformer (Zhong, Wang, and Miao 2019;\nLi et al. 2020) is leveraged in ERC to capture contextual\ninformation. Except contextual information, speaker infor-\nmation is proven to be important to ERC. Speakers can be\nregarded as objects related to utterances or additional infor-\nmation for utterances. As objects, speakers are involved in\nthe graph of conversation as nodes to interact with utterances\n(Zhang et al. 2019). As additional information, speaker in-\nformation is modeled via utterances. Speciﬁcally, Hazarika\net al. (2018b,a) employ GRUs and Memory Network (Mem-\nnet) (Sukhbaatar et al. 2015) to model speakers’ interactions\nin the dyadic conversation, which is difﬁcult to extend to\nmulti-speaker conditions. Therefore, Majumder et al. (2019)\ngeneralize speakers as parties, track them by GRU, and uti-\nlize attention mechanism to gather interactive information in\nmulti-speaker conversations. Even so, Ghosal et al. (2019)\nargue that Majumder et al. (2019) ignored the inﬂuences\nfrom other speakers and propose Self and Inter-Speaker de-\npendencies to formalize interactions within and between\nspeakers. However, the complicated modeling of speakers’\ninteractions is difﬁcult to apply in other models, thus requir-\ning a simpliﬁed version.\nUtilization of mask in Transformer Masks in Trans-\nformer are utilized to mask the unattended elements in self-\nattention. Recently, masks are well-designed and leveraged\nin language modeling (Dong et al. 2019; Devlin et al. 2019;\nRadford et al. 2018) and conversation structure modeling\n(Zhu et al. 2020). Masks are ﬂexible and convenient to be\nimplemented and we choose them to model the interactions\nof speakers in Transformer.\nMethodology\nIn this section, we will elaborate on the task deﬁnition and\nthe structure of TRMSM which is illustrated in Fig. 2. Our\nmodel contains 4 parts: Sentence-Level Encoder, Dialogue-\nLevel Encoder, Fusing Method, and Classiﬁer.\nTask Deﬁnition\nERC task includes K emotions, whose set is E =\n{emo1,emo2,...,emo K}. Given a conversation C =\n[u1,u2,...,u N ] containing N textual utterances, each ut-\nterance un = [ w1,w2,...,w Ln ] within is sequentially\nformed by Ln words. Particularly, M speakers, whose set is\nSPK = {spk1,spk2,...,spk M }, participate in the conver-\nsation. For each utterance un, a emotion label en ∈E and\na speaker annotation pn ∈ SPK are assigned. ERC task\naims to predict the emotion of every utterance in Cwith the\ninformation provided above.\nSentence-Level Encoder\nTo encode a more informative and context-aware represen-\ntation of a single utterance based on Transformer, we utilize\n...\nBERT Encoder\nMaxpooling+Linear\nw1w2w𝑳𝒏\n…\nAdd & Nrom\nAdd & Nrom\nFeed Forward\nMasked Multi-\nHead Attention\nAdd & Nrom\nAdd & Nrom\nFeed Forward\nMasked Multi-\nHead Attention\nAdd & Nrom\nAdd & Nrom\nFeed Forward\nMasked Multi-\nHead Attention\nClassifier\ne...\n… …\n(c) Inter-Speaker Mask\nP1\nP2\nP1\nP2\nP1 P2 P1 P2\n(a) Conventional Mask\nP1\nP2\nP1\nP2\nP1 P2 P1 P2\n(b) Intra-Speaker Mask\nP1\nP2\nP1\nP2\nP1 P2 P1 P2\n+ + =\nConcat =\nFusing Method\nInter-Speaker Blocks\nIntra-Speaker Blocks\nConventional Blocks\nun\nu1\nuN\n(i) Add (ii) Concatenation\n1\n-inf\nDialogue-Level EncoderSentence-Level Encoder Classifier\ne\ne\nUtterance\nxN\nC\nOC\nC\nOC\nRA\nOC\nER\n𝑅\nAttention \nFigure 2: The structure of our proposed model, which is based on Transformer structure.

The fusing methods include Attention, (i)Add, and (ii)Concatenation.\na BERT encoder. Limited by the max length of a sequence\nsupported by BERT, we cannot input the concatenated se-\nquence of all utterances in a conversation, whose length fre-\nquently exceeds 768 in cases of long conversations, to cap-\nture the global contextual information. Therefore, BERT is\nsolely used to encode the sentence-level context in a single\nutterance. An utterance un = [w1,w2,...,w Ln ] is fed into\nBERT to obtain the contextualized representation of words:\nW = BERT(w1,w2,...,w Ln ) (1)\nwhere W ∈RLn×dw is the output of the top layer of BERT\nand dw is the dimension of the word representation. To ob-\ntain an utterance representation for un, a max-pooling oper-\nation followed by a projection is deployed:\nun = Linear(Maxpooling(W)) (2)\nwhere un ∈Rdu represents the utterance and du is the di-\nmension of utterance representation. By processing every ut-\nterance in a conversation, we ﬁnally obtain the representa-\ntion matrix C ∈RN×du .\nDialogue-Level Encoder\nIn the dialogue level, we utilize three transformer blocks:\nConventional Blocks for conventional context modeling,\nIntra-Speaker Blocks for Intra-Speaker dependency, and\nInter-Speaker Blocks for Inter-Speaker dependency. Due to\nthe same structures of all Transformer blocks, we simply in-\ntroduce the general process of the ﬁrst layer of Transformer\nblocks.\nGiven the conversation matrix C processed by the\nsentence-level encoder, to avoid the absence of positional in-\nformation in C, an Absolute Positional Embedding is added\nto every representation in C:\nC = C+ PE(0 :N) (3)\nwhere PE(0 :N) is in the same dimension as C.\nSelf-attention intuitively provides an interactive pattern\nfor contextual modeling of conversations. Taking advantage\nof the mechanism of self-attention, the targeted utterances\ncan be parallelly processed. Therefore, the targeted utter-\nances are regarded as a query matrix, and the contextual ut-\nterances act as a key matrix, so that every utterance simul-\ntaneously assesses how much information shall be obtained\nfrom every contextual utterance. In this way, C is projected\nto query matrix Q ∈RN×da , key matrix K ∈RN×da , and\nvalue matrix V ∈RN×da by linear projections without bias:\n[Q; K; V] =Linear([C; C; C]) where [] is the concatenat-\ning operation. Self-attention is calculated by:\nA(Q,K,V,M ) =softmax((QKT ) ∗M√da\n)V (4)\nwhere ∗denotes element-wise multiplication; M ∈RN×N\nis the utilized mask which is a square matrix whose non-\ninﬁnite elements equal 1. We will introduce different masks\nused by diverse blocks later. Transformer hires multiple self-\nattention (Multi-Head Attention, MHA) to model different\naspects of information. And then the outputs of all heads\nare concatenated and projected to O with the same size\nof C. After the Attention module, a Position-wise Feed-\nForward Network (FFN) module is deployed to produce out-\nput F ∈RN×du . MHA and FFN are both residually con-\nnected. Therefore the output O1\nC of the ﬁrst layer of Trans-\nformer is:\nA\n′\n= LayerNorm(O+ C), (5)\nF = max(0,A\n′\nW1 + b1)W2 + b2, (6)\nO1\nC = LayerNorm(F + A\n′\n). (7)\nO1\nC acts as the input of the second transformer layer, and\nby this analogy, we obtain the ﬁnal output OC ∈RN×du\nafter multiple layers. Therefore, the outputs of our 3 blocks\ncan be denoted as: OC\nC for Conventional Block, ORA\nC for\nIntra-Speaker Block, andOER\nC for Inter-Speaker Block. Due\nto the limited space in this paper, more details about Trans-\nformer can be reviewed in Vaswani et al. (2017).\nMasks can prompt Transformer blocks to realize their\ndifferent functions, and we introduce how to form these 3\nmasks:\nConventional Mask sets all the elements of itself to 1,\nwhich means that every targeted utterance can get access to\nall the contextual utterances. Conventional Mask is applied\nin the multi-head attention of Conventional Blocks and is\nillustrated in Fig. 2 (a). We annotate Conventional Mask as\nMC.\nIntra-Speaker Mask only considers those contextual ut-\nterances tagged with pn, which is the speaker tag of the\ntargeted utterance. Therefore, based on MC, Intra-Speaker\nMask MRA sets positions representing other speakers to -\nINF . Intra-Speaker Mask is illustrated in Fig. 2 (b).\nInter-Speaker Mask regards other speakers different\nfrom the one of the targeted utterance as one unit due to\nour simpliﬁcation. Therefore, based on MC, Inter-Speaker\nMask MER sets positions whose speaker is the same as the\nspeaker tag of the targeted utterance to -INF. Inter-Speaker\nMask is illustrated in Fig. 2 (c).\nFusing Method\nAs blocks produce different outputs that carry various\nspeaker-aware contextual information, we utilize 3 simple\nmethods to fuse the information.\nAdd As illustrated in Fig. 2 (i), Add equally regards the\ncontributions of all outputs of blocks. Therefore, the fusing\nrepresentation is:\nR= OC\nC + ORA\nC + OER\nC (8)\nConcatenation Concatenation (illustrated in Fig. 2 (ii))\nis also a simple but effective method to combine different\ninformation. Different from Add operation, Concatenation\ncan implicitly choose the information which is important for\nthe ﬁnal prediction due to the following linear projection of\nclassiﬁer. Therefore, the fusing representation R∈RN×3du\nis:\nR= Concat(OC\nC ,ORA\nC ,OER\nC ,dim = 1) (9)\nAttention As the contributions of different speaker par-\nties are diversely weighted, it is feasible that the model au-\ntomatically chooses the more important information. There-\nfore, we utilize the widely used attention (Lian et al. 2019)\nDataset Num. ofdialogues Num. ofutterances Avg. lengthof dialoguetrain dev test train dev test train/devtest\nIEMOCAP 120 31 5810 1623 48 52MELD 1039 114 280 9989 1109 2610 10 9\nTable 1: Statistics about IEMOCAP and MELD.\nto achieve this goal. Attention mechanism takes 3 block out-\nputting representations as inputs and produces an attention\nscore for each representation. For simplicity, we take rep-\nresentations OC\nC i ∈R1×du , ORA\nC i ∈R1×du , and OER\nC i ∈\nR1×du of utterance ias an example. Therefore, the attention\nscore and fusing representation are computed as:\nOi = Concat(OC\nC i,ORA\nC i,OER\nC i,dim = 0), (10)\nα= softmax(wF Oi\nT ), (11)\nRi = αOi. (12)\nwhere Oi ∈ R3×du is the concatenated representations,\nα∈R1×3 is the attention score, wF ∈R1×du is a trainable\nparameter, and Ri ∈R1×du is the fusing representation. Fi-\nnally, all fusing representations of utterances are concate-\nnated as R∈RN×du .\nClassiﬁer\nWith the sentence-level and dialogue-level contextual infor-\nmation fully modeled by encoders, the dialogue-level output\nis fed to a classiﬁer which predicts the ﬁnal emotion distri-\nbutions:\nˆY = softmax(RWclf + bclf ) (13)\nwhere Wclf ∈Rdu×K(Wclf ∈R3du×K for Concatenation),\nbclf ∈RK and ˆY is the matrix of emotion distributions of\nall utterances in conversation C. The model is trained by a\ncross-entropy loss function, which is calculated as:\nL= − 1∑T\nl=1 Nl\nT∑\nl=1\nNl∑\ni=1\nK∑\ne=1\nye\ni log( ˆYe\ni ) (14)\nwhere yi is the one-hot vector denoting the emotion label\nof utterance iin a conversation, edenotes the dimension of\neach emotion, Nl denotes the length of l-th conversation,\nand T denotes the number of conversations in a dataset.\nExperimental Setup\nDatasets\nWe evaluate our models on two datasets: IEMOCAP (Busso\net al. 2008), MELD (Poria et al. 2019a), and both of them\nare multi-modal datasets that contain three modalities. We\nsolely consider the textual modality following Ghosal et al.\n(2019). Statistics about the datasets are shown in Tab. 1.\n• IEMOCAP This dataset contains a series of dyadic\nconversation between 10 unique speakers. 6 categories\nof emotions are considered in our experiments: neutral,\nhappy, sad, angry, excited, and frustrated.

Weighted-F1 score (wF1) is used as the metric. † means referring from\nGhosal et al. (2019).\n• MELD This dataset contains over 1400 multi-speakers\nconversations collected from the TV seriesFriends. Emo-\ntions in this dataset are annotated into 7 categories: neu-\ntral, joy, surprise, anger, disgust, sadness and fear.\nCompared Methods\nTo distinguish our models with different fusing methods,\nwe construct 3 model variants: TRMSM-Add, TRMSM-Cat,\nand TRMSM-Att. To show the importance of the speaker-\nrelated information, we construct our model without Intra-\nSpeaker Blocks and Inter-Speaker Blocks, which we denote\nit as TRM. Besides, our models are compared with the base-\nlines below:\n• CMN (Hazarika et al. 2018b) CMN is proposed to\nmodel dyadic conversations using two sets of RNNs and\nMemnets to respectively track different speakers.\n• DialogueRNN (Majumder et al. 2019) DialogueRNN\nis the ﬁrst state-of-the-art model to address ERC of multi-\nspeakers. RNNs are deployed to track speakers’ states and\nglobal state during conversations.\n• AGHMN (Jiao, Lyu, and King 2020) AGHMN is the\nstate-of-the-art unidirectional model in real-time ERC.\nTo retain the positional information from its hierarchical\nstructure, a GRU is constructed for attention mechanism.\n• DialogueGCN (Ghosal et al. 2019) To fully model the\ninteractive information between speakers, DialogueGCN\nmodels detailed dependencies between speakers using a\nRelational GCN.\n• KET (Zhong, Wang, and Miao 2019) KET introduces\nthe Transformer structure to model context in conversa-\ntions. It also proposes an effective graph attention to ex-\ntract information from commonsense knowledge bases.\n• BERT (Devlin et al. 2019) A vanilla BERT followed by\na classiﬁer is ﬁne-tuned to show the importance of con-\ntext.\n• Other baselines Both based on CNN to extract se-\nmantic information, scLSTM (Poria et al. 2017) utilizes\nLSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber 1997) and Mem-\nnet (Sukhbaatar et al. 2015) utilizes memory network to\nmodel conversational context.\nImplementation\nFor BERT and sentence-level encoder, an uncased BERT-\nbase1 model is adopted. For the dialogue-level encoder, the\ndimension of dialogue-level representation is set to 300 for\nIEMOCAP and 200 for MELD; the number of transformer\nlayers is set to 6 for IEMOCAP and 1 for MELD; the\nnumber of heads is set 6 for IEMOCAP and 4 for MELD;\ndropout rate is set to 0.1. Additionally, models are trained\nusing AdamW (Kingma and Ba 2015; Loshchilov and Hut-\nter 2019) for 10000 steps with 1000 steps for warming up,\nand the learning rate linearly decaying after the warm-up is\nset to 1e-5 for IEMOCAP and 8e-6 for MELD. Due to the\nparallel prediction of utterances in one conversation, batch\nsize is set to 1 following Jiao, Lyu, and King (2020). Be-\nsides, DialogueGCN is trained in the setting of 90:10 data\nsplit on IEMOCAP, and for a fair comparison, we re-run\nDialogueGCN with 80:20 data split using the open-source\ncode2. All of our results reported are the average values of 5\nruns.\nResults and Discussions\nOverall Results\nFor IEMOCAP, weighted-F1 (wF1) score is used as the met-\nric. However, the data proportion of MELD is in a severely\nimbalanced condition. Therefore, the weighted-F1 score is\nnot that proper and enough for MELD. To balance the contri-\nbutions of large classes and small classes, we follow Zhang\net al. (2020) and also use the average value of macro F1\nscore and micro F1 score as one metric, which is calculated\nby mF1 = (F1macro + F1micro)/2.\nFor IEMOCAP, as shown in Tab. 2, BERT attains wF1\nof 54.01 which is substantially worse than our models and\nmost state-of-the-art models considering the dialogue-level\ncontext. This result may indicate that IEMOCAP contains\nconsiderable utterances that cannot be predicted only de-\npending on the semantic information, which is out of the\n1https://github.com/huggingface/transformers\n2https://github.com/declare-lab/conv-\nemotion/tree/master/DialogueGCN\nMethods MELDNeutral Surprise Fear Sadness Joy Disgust Anger AverageAcc.

Furthermore, TRMSM-Att outper-\nforms AGHMN by 2.24 wF1 and DialogueGCN (80: 20)\nby 3.28 wF1, which beneﬁts from the powerful Transformer\nand our speaker modeling with long-distance information\nconsidered. For emotions, TRMSM-Att achieves the best\nF1 on Frustrated, and TRMSM-Add achieves the best F1\non Neutral. Besides, our models can attain second or third\nhigher results among other emotions. This demonstrates that\nour models are competitive to achieve comprehensive per-\nformance.\nFor MELD, as shown in Tab. 3, BERT outperforms other\nstate-of-the-art models by a great margin, which indicates\nthe importance of external knowledge brought by BERT.\nCompared with BERT, TRM attains marginally better re-\nsults, which may be attributed to the limited conversational\ncontextual information in MELD. To conﬁrm this, compar-\ning the results of CNN 3 and scLSTM (based on CNN), we\ncan notice that the improvement is also limited. Although\nMELD provides limited contextual information in conversa-\ntions, TRMSM-Att still outperforms BERT by 1.29 wF1 and\n1.17 mF1, which indicates the effectiveness of our model to\ncapture such information. For emotions, BERT beats other\nstate-of-the-art models by a great margin in such an imbal-\nanced circumstance, and TRMSM-Att attains the best F1 on\n4 emotions including large classes Joy, Anger, Surprise, and\nthe small class Disgust.

TRMSM-Att outperforming TRMSM-Cat demon-\nstrates that automatically and explicitly picking up speaker-\nrelated information is better than the implicit way.\nModel Analysis\nAblation Study To better understand the inﬂuences of\nmasks on our models, we report the results of the models\nremoving the Transformer blocks with different masks on\nIEMOCAP and MELD. In this part, we denote Convention\nMask as CM and Intra-Speaker, Inter-Speaker Masks as SM.\nAccordingly, TRMSM w/o SM is equivalent to TRM.\nAs seen in Fig. 3, on both datasets, TRMSM w/o CM\n(solely applying SM) can achieve better performance than\nTRMSM w/o SM (solely applying CM). We attribute it to\nthat speaker modeling does not drop the contextual informa-\ntion from conversations, and on the contrary, speaker mod-\neling can guide the model to extract more effective informa-\ntion to the ﬁnal prediction. Furthermore, TRMSM outper-\nforms both TRMSM w/o CM and TRMSM w/o SM, which\ndemonstrates that all of our designed masks are critical to\nachieving better performance.\nEffect of Range of Context To ﬁnd out the inﬂuence\nof the range of context on our model, we train TRMSM-Att\nwith different ranges of available context on IEMOCAP and\nrefer the results from Ghosal et al. (2019) for DialogueGCN.\nWe utilize different windows (−x,y) to limit the context,\nwhere x, yis respectively the number of utterances in prior\ncontext and post context. As illustrated in Fig. 4, with the\nwindow widened, the performance increases as shown in\nboth models.

This\nindicates that the local contextual information is critical for\nthe prediction and the long-distance information is also im-\nportant for contextual modeling to further improve the per-\nformance.\nEffect of Number of Layers We study the effect of\nthe number of layers to our model on different datasets. Fig.\n6 illustrates the radar graphs for the F1 scores of emotions\nin IEMOCAP and MELD by TRM and TRMSM-Att. As\nthe number of layers increasing, the F1 scores of emotions\nin IEMOCAP normally expand. While in MELD, increas-\ning the number of layers gradually hurts the performance to\nbe 0 of F1 on emotions Fear and Disgust which are classes\nwith the fewest data. We think the reason may be that MELD\nsuffers from data imbalance and increasing the number of\nlayers leads to severer overﬁtting on small classes. For data\nimbalance, methods like re-balance can be applied to allevi-\nate it. Re-balance is out of the scope of this paper and our\nfuture work will study data imbalance of ERC.\nCase Study\nTo better understand how our model captures Intra-Speaker\nand Inter-Speaker dependencies, we illustrate two conver-\nsation clips ending with the targeted utterances so that\nthe targeted utterances can only refer to the prior context.\nWe choose TRMSM-Att without Conventional Blocks so\nthat only speaker information related blocks are considered.\nSpeciﬁcally, we illustrate heatmaps of attention from fusing\nmethod and self-attention4 in Transformer blocks. For sim-\nplicity, we denote attention from fusing method as FAtt.\nIn the scene of Fig. 5 (a), the speaker M keeps in frus-\ntration through the conversation and F in a neutral state has\nfew inﬂuences on M. Therefore, FAtt pays more attention to\nIntra-Speaker dependency so that Intra-Speaker Blocks can\nextract information from M himself. We can see from the\nheatmap that the targeted utterance yeah grades the highest\nscore to the farthest contextual utterance whose emotion is\nalso frustration, which is out of the range of context that Dia-\nlogueGCN can refer. In a sense, this indicates the importance\nof long-distance information.\nAs the condition in Fig. 5 (b), speakers in this conver-\nsation basically keep in a neutral state except that Chan-\ndler shows other emotions like anger and surprise before\nthe targeted utterance. Although the targeted utterance with\nspeaker Chandler shows slight sadness from the semantic\nview, it is supposed to be predicted as neutral according to\nthe conversational context. Speciﬁcally, FAtt grades Inter-\nSpeaker Blocks with higher score and self-attention in Inter-\nSpeaker Blocks extracts information from the neutral utter-\nances of other speakers. This case indicates the effectiveness\nof our model to extract inter-speaker information.\nConclusion\nIn this work, we simplify the Self and Inter-Speaker de-\npendencies to a binary version. To achieve the simpliﬁed\nmodeling of speakers’ interactions, we design three masks:\nConventional Mask, Intra-Speaker Mask, and Inter-Speaker\nMask. These masks are utilized in the self-attention mod-\nules of the second-level Transformer blocks of a hierarchical\nTransformer. As the speaker-aware information extracted by\ndifferent masks diversely contributes to the prediction, atten-\ntion mechanism is utilized to weight and fuse them. Finally,\nour model achieves state-of-the-art results on 2 ERC datasets\nand further analysis shows that our model is efﬁcacious for\nERC.\n4We average the attention scores of all self-attention heads in\nthe top layer of Transformer\nReferences\nBusso, C.; Bulut, M.; Lee, C.; Kazemzadeh, A.; Mower,\nE.; Kim, S.; Chang, J.
