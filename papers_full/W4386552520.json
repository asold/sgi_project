While profes-\nsional photographers often tackle exposure issues with specialized\nequipment and software, these solutions necessitate considerable\nexpertise and can be costly. Moreover, harsh exposure conditions\ncan adversely impact the performance of downstream computer\nvision tasks. Consequently, there is a pressing need for a model\narXiv:2309.00872v2  [cs.CV]  18 Dec 2023\nMM ’23, October 29–November 3, 2023, Ottawa, ON, Canada. Gehui Li et al.\ncapable of correcting images with a wide range of exposure errors\nto achieve consistent, normal exposure without sacrificing color\nfidelity or detail.\nExisting models [13, 22, 36, 39, 40, 43–45, 53, 56] primarily ad-\ndressing single exposure error scenarios perform inadequately\nwhen confronted with images containing multiple exposure errors.\nPredicated on the assumption that scene lighting is low-light, these\nmethods are inherently ill-equipped to adapt to varying exposure\nstates. In addition, multi-exposure fusion methods[30, 31, 33, 34, 38]\nare powerless when there is only one image of the same scene. These\nlimitation have spurred the development of new approaches[1, 7,\n11, 45, 52] for tackling multiple exposure errors.\nMSEC[1] addresses exposure correction of input images under\ndiverse lighting. LCDP[52] is designed to tackle the challenge of\nmultiple exposure errors within a single image. However, existing\napproaches suffer from two critical shortcomings. First, when pre-\nsented with a set of images with different exposure errors for the\nsame scene, these methods fail to achieve a consistent correction\nstate, leading to considerable discrepancies in the correction out-\ncomes. Second, they struggle to restore distorted details in heavily\noverexposed and underexposed areas, resulting in unbalanced and\nlackluster colors in the corrected images.\nRecognizing the importance of addressing the irreversible color\ndistortion in severely overexposed or underexposed regions, we\nadvocate for the utilization of richer semantic information from\nneighboring regions to compensate for the lost color. By providing\nthe network with enhanced access to multi-scale information, the\nrecovery of color-distorted regions is facilitated. To this end, we\npropose the Macro-Micro Transformer Restorer (MMT Restorer).\nSimultaneously, we introduce a dynamic negative sample generator\nand a contrast constraint function. By incorporating a substantial\nnumber of high-quality negative samples, the network learns a\nmore consistent criterion, ultimately enhancing the consistency\nof input image correction. Furthermore, we present the Macro-\nMicro-Hierarchical Transformer (MMHT), a hierarchical extension\nof MMT Restorer, which refines the correction process from coarse\nto fine, further improving the quality of the corrected images.\nThe contributions of this paper are as follows:\n•We propose a Macro-Micro-Hierarchical Transformer, which,\nin comparison to existing methods, yields visually appealing\ncolors and consistently corrected outcomes.\n•Considering the limited capacity of convolutions to attend to\nnon-local regions, we design a Macro-Micro Attention mech-\nanism that effectively restores distorted color by strengthen-\ning global dependencies.\n•To explore the intrinsic information of over-/under- exposed\nimage and the reference one, we raises a hierarchical con-\ntrastive learning scheme. In this manner, the restored image\nis pulled to the reference image and pushed away from the\nmultiple exposed ones in a hierarchical latent feature spaces.\n•Extensive experimental results demonstrate our method em-\npirically realizes the remarkable promotion in color and con-\nsistency of corrected images, as well as standard accuracy\nfor low-light segmentation and detection compared with\nexisting advanced networks.\n2 RELATED WORK\n2.1 Methods against Harsh Lighting Condition\nLow-Light Enhancement. Traditional methods[3, 12, 12, 14, 35,\n37, 40, 58, 67, 69] based on Retinex theory have been favored in\nrecent years. These methods mainly decompose the image into\nreflectance map and illumination map, and then do processing on\nthem separately to get the final result. Therefore, the goal is to\npredict the illumination map to obtain a well-exposed target image.\nSome deep learning-based methods[6, 10, 18–21, 23, 28, 32, 53, 56,\n65, 71] have also emerged subsequently. All these works are lim-\nited to image correction for underexposure conditions. However,\nmis-exposed images are common in reality, which also contain a\nlarge number of over-exposed and unevenly exposed images. There-\nfore, our goal is to construct a model capable of simultaneously\ncorrecting images with these different exposure levels.\nExposure Correction. MSEC[1] proposes a coarse-to-fine deep\nlearning approach that focuses for the first time on the task of\nsimultaneously correcting overexposed and underexposed images.\nIAT[7] decomposes the Image Signal Processor (ISP) into local and\nglobal image components to correct the image from low-light or\noverexposure conditions and proceeds to solve the problem of low-\nlight image semantic segmentation. LCDP[52] proposes the LCDE\nmodule with Dual-Illumination mechanism to solve the problem\nof having multiple exposure errors on a single image. However,\nexisting methods still have two common problems: inconsistent cor-\nrection results and non-enjoyable colors. In this paper, we propose\na Macro-Micro-Hierarchical Transformer to solve them.\n2.2 Vision Transformers\nA number of image restorers designed using transformer have\nappeared. For example, Uformer[ 55] replaces the building block\nwith its proposed LeWin Transformer Block based on the Encoder-\nDecoder structure of U-Net, which consists of window attention\nwith a sliding window[41] and Locally Enhanced Feed-forward[62].\nRestormer[63] proposes Transformer Block consisting of A Multi-\nDconv Head Transposed Attention with Gated Dconv Feed-forward\nNetwork. But these general image restorers, have a common prob-\nlem that they do not adapt well to the exposure correction problem.\nIn this paper, we propose a Macro-Micro Transformer Block con-\ntaining two mechanisms of complementary Attention to solve this\nproblem. Although Transformers has a stronger model fitting capa-\nbility, it requires far more data than CNNs because of the lack of in-\nductive bias. How to effectively combine the strengths of both is an\nimportant issue. A large number of networks[47, 48, 57, 62, 64, 66]\ndesigned for high level tasks in recent years have organically com-\nbined convolution and transformer. The Coatnet[9] is particularly\nenlightening in its exploration of the arrangement of convolution\nbuilding blocks and transformer building blocks. Using a similar\nexperimental method, we design the final network structure and\nits better adaptation to our task.\n3 METHOD\n3.1 The overall of the proposed method\nOur proposed method commences with a Laplace decomposition\nto obtain four-layer decomposed images, L1-L4, derived from the\nFearless Luminance Adaptation: A Macro-Micro-Hierarchical Transformer for Exposure Correction MM ’23, October 29–November 3, 2023, Ottawa, ON, Canada.\n(b) Macro-Micro Transformer Block\n(c) Macro & Micro Partition / Reverse\n(a) The overall of the proposed method (d)  Macro & Micro Attention \nFigure 2: (a) The architecture of our MMHT method, which contains MMT Restorer and U-Net Restorer to reconstruct the\nnormal exposure image.

The primary objective of this operation is to\ndecompose the source images into distinct spatial frequency bands,\nthereby enabling the utilization of separate networks for the restora-\ntion of colors and details in specific frequency bands at varying\ndecomposition levels. The L4 image is fed into the network as the\ninitial term. The architecture of the network comprises four stages,\nwith stages 1, 2, and 3 designated for the Macro-Micro Transformer\nRestorer (MMT Restorer) and stage 4 for the U-Net Restorer. In the\nfinal stage, we employ a convolution-based structure as a substitute\nfor the MMT Restorer. This decision is motivated by the fact that\nthe transformer sacrifices its inductive bias while acquiring a global\nperceptual field through the attention structure. Consequently, we\nconstruct the U-Net Restorer by replacing the MMT Block with\nmulti-layer convolutions, while preserving the overall structure of\nthe MMT Restorer. In combination with convolution, our method\nachieves superior correction results. An additional benefit of this\napproach is that implementing convolution on larger sizes reduces\nthe computation complexity. Following each stage, up-sampling is\nperformed to double the width and height. Ultimately, the512 ×512\nsize image is up-sampled by BGU[4] to its original size, yielding\nthe final output. A schematic representation of the framework is\ndepicted in Figure 2.\n3.2 Macro-Micro Transformer Restorer\nAs illustrated in Figure 2 (a), the specific structure of our method\nis as follows. Given an input image, its dimensions are initially\nincreased by an Embedding layer to C. Subsequently, the input is\nprocessed through an Encoder consisting of three stages, wherein\nidentical MMT Blocks are stacked repeatedly with 𝐿𝑖 layers in\neach stage. Upon generating the feature output, the image size\nis downsampled using pooling, and the dimensions are increased\nvia point-wise convolution. Following feature extraction by the\nEncoder, initial semantic features are obtained. These semantic\nfeatures are further refined using the Bottle Block, which serves as\ninput for the Decoder to guide the generation of exposure-corrected\nimages. Prior to feeding the image into the subsequent stage, it\nis upsampled using Pixel-shuffle[ 51] and concatenated with the\nfeatures processed by the Encoder at the same stage via a skip\nconnection. In a similar way, the dimensionality is reduced to 3 by\nthe Projection layer, and the resulting output is added to the input\nimage to produce the exposure-corrected image.\n3.3 Macro-Micro Transformer Block\nIn MMT Restorer, we alternately arrange Macro Attention and\nMicro Attention to obtain global and local features, but with linear\ncomplexity for spatial dimensions. Diagram is shown in Figure 2\n(b). The formulas of spatial attention is as follows.\nA𝑆𝑝𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑙 (Q,K,V)= 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑐𝑎𝑡 (ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑑1,...,ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑑 𝐶\n𝐻𝑑\n), (1)\n𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 head𝑖 = Softmax\n\u0012\nQ𝑖K𝑇\n𝑖√𝐻𝑑\n\u0013\nV𝑖. Q𝑖 = X𝑖W𝑄\n𝑖 ,K𝑖 = X𝑖W𝐾\n𝑖 and\nV𝑖 = X𝑖W𝑉\n𝑖 ∈R𝑃×𝐻𝑑. W𝑖 denotes the projection weights of the𝑖𝑡ℎ\nhead for Q𝑖,K𝑖,V𝑖. 𝑃 is is the number of total patches. 𝐻𝑑 is head\ndimension. 𝐶 is the total channel size.\n3.3.1 Micro Attention. Conventional transformers employ global\nattention computation, resulting in a quadratic computational com-\nplexity. In contrast, Micro Attention confines attention computation\nto each window, effectively reducing the computational burden. Mi-\ncro Partition: (𝐻\n𝐷 ×𝐷,𝑊\n𝐷 ×𝐷,𝐶)→( 𝐻𝑊\n𝐷2 ,𝐷2,𝐶). After partition,\nwe have the following formula.\nMSA𝑀𝑖𝑐𝑟𝑜 (Q,K,V)=\n\b\nA𝑆𝑝𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑙 (Q𝑗,K𝑗,V𝑗)\n\t𝐻𝑊\n𝐷2\n𝑗=0 , (2)\n𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 Q𝑗,K𝑗,V𝑗 ∈R𝐷2 ×𝐶 are local window queries, keys, and\nvalues. Each window contains D ×D patches.\nMM ’23, October 29–November 3, 2023, Ottawa, ON, Canada. Gehui Li et al.\nDespite this significant reduction in computation, the exclusive\nfocus on the window attention results in the loss of global informa-\ntion modeling capabilities. To address this limitation, we propose\nMacro Attention, characterized by a larger receptive field. This\nnovel approach complements Micro Attention, augmenting the\nacquisition of multi-scale information.\n3.3.2 Macro Attention. Drawing inspiration from the mechanism\nof dilated convolution, we incorporate it into the window division\nof attention in order to expand the receptive field. This adaptation\neffectively enhances the acquisition of global information while\npreserving linear complexity. Each window is inflated such that\nall windows fill the entire feature map without overlap. Macro\nPartition: (𝐺 ×𝐻\n𝐺,𝐺 ×𝑊\n𝐺 ,𝐶) → (𝐺2,𝐻𝑊\n𝐺2 ,𝐶) → (𝐻𝑊\n𝐺2 ,𝐺2,𝐶).\nAfter partition, we have the following formula.\nMSA𝑀𝑎𝑐𝑟𝑜 (Q,K,V)=\n\b\nA𝑆𝑝𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑙 (Q𝑗,K𝑗,V𝑗)\n\t𝐻𝑊\n𝐺2\n𝑗=0 , (3)\n𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 Q𝑗,K𝑗,V𝑗 ∈R𝐺2 ×𝐶 are dilated window queries, keys, and\nvalues. Each dilated window contains G ×G patches.\n3.4 Loss Function\nWe train our model with following loss function:\nLTotal = 𝜆1LMAE +𝜆2LDEC +𝜆3LCR, (4)\nwhere LMAE denotes Mean absolute loss, LDEC the Pyramid de-\ncomposition loss and LCR the contrastive regularization.\n3.4.1 Mean absolute loss. 𝐿1 loss is used to characterize the error\nbetween the corrected image and the ground truth.\nLMAE =\n3𝐻𝑊∑︁\n𝑝=1\n|Y(𝑝)−T(𝑝)|, (5)\nwhere H, W are the height and width of the input size of the current\nimage, respectively. T represents the ground truth and Y represents\nthe network corrected image by bilateral interpolation to the origi-\nnal size image. p represents the pixels on the image.\n3.4.2 Pyramid decomposition loss. This loss is used to measure the\nerror between the decomposed corrected image and its ground truth\nlayer by layer. These errors are proportionally merged together to\nform the loss of the decomposed image.\nLDEC =\n𝑁∑︁\n𝑖=2\n2(𝑖−2)\n3ℎ𝑖𝑤𝑖∑︁\n𝑝=1\n\f\fY(𝑖)(𝑝)−T(𝑖)(𝑝)\n\f\f, (6)\nwhere N represents the number of levels of the pyramid.Y(𝑖)stands\nfor i-th corrected pyramid output. T(𝑖)represents the i-th gaussian\npyramid layer decomposed from T. ℎ𝑖 = 1\n2𝑖−1 ℎand 𝑤𝑖 = 1\n2𝑖−1 𝑤.\n3.4.3 Contrastive regularization. As highlighted in existing con-\ntrast learning methods[5], diverse negative samples are vital for\neffective contrast learning. We propose a dynamic negative sample\ngeneration strategy, wherein for each input GT image, K negative\nsamples are generated via gamma correction, with gamma values\nuniformly selected from the range [G1, G2].

The test set of MSEC contains\n1181 sets of images of the same scene with five different exposures,\naccompanied by the correction results of five different experts.\nTable 1 shows that our method outperforms all existing methods in\nterms of PSNR and SSIM on all five expert test sets of MSEC. For\ncolor performance comparisons in Table 2, our method achieves\nthe lowest FID, indicating that the proposed method is capable of\nproducing realistic, natural and consistent images. In addition, the\nlowest NIQE indicates that the corrected images of our method have\nthe best subjective viewability. There are some methods that are\ncloser to our method on CF, but the FIDs of these methods are much\nhigher than ours, which means that they generate a lot of rare colors.\nTherefore, ΔCF is used to measure the difference between the CF\nof the corrected image and that of the expert image. A lower ΔCF\nindicates a more realistic color of the image. OurΔCF is significantly\nbetter than all other methods. The performance comparisons are\npresented in the Figure 7 in the form of radar map.

To explore the\noptimal arrangement of transformer and convolution, we design an\nablation study for the network used in each stage, with results in\nTable 4. As U-Net is progressively replaced by the MMT Restorer,\nthe quantitative results improve. However, there is a slight drop\nin PSNR and SSIM when the last network is replaced, as removing\nthe convolution entirely eliminates the inductive bias. Combining\nconvolution with transformers yields the better results, with R1,\nR2, R3 as the best pipeline. We also conduct ablation experiments\non Laplacian pyramid decomposition. As shown in the Table 4 and\nFigure 12(a), MMT Restorer performs well even without Laplacian\npyramid decomposition but compromises the coarse-to-fine correc-\ntion, negatively impacting results qualitatively and quantitatively.\n4.5.2 Experiments on the Effect of Macro-Micro Attention. Global\ninformation acquisition is crucial for addressing image exposure\ncorrection issues. However, the micro attention restricts operations\nto a single window and loses long-range dependencies. We intro-\nduce macro attention with a larger receptive field in combination\nwith micro attention to effectively acquire multi-scale information.\nAn ablation study is designed for macro-micro attention, with re-\nsults presented in Table 5.

To\nexamine the effect of contrastive loss, we remove the contrastive\nloss in the adjusting attention order. As shown in the Table 5, there\nis a significant reduction in the PSNR and SSIM. Figure 12(d) shows\nthat removing contrastive learning leads to inconsistent correction\nresults for different exposure inputs. Contrastive constraint encour-\nages the model to learn features distinguishing well-exposed im-\nages from exposure-error images. Using abundant negative samples\nforces the model to learn more discriminative features, resulting in\nconsistent exposure correction performance.\nTable 5: Exploring the effect of Macro-Micro Attention and\nContrastive Regularization.\nMic Mac Mic-Mac Mac-Mic𝐿𝐶𝑅 PSNR↑ SSIM↑ ΔCF↓ FID↓\n✓ ✗ ✗ ✗ ✗ 22.092 0.823 3.945 16.712\n✗ ✓ ✗ ✗ ✗ 22.325 0.836 2.616 12.301\n✗ ✗ ✓ ✗ ✗ 22.791 0.843 2.419 11.818\n✗ ✗ ✗ ✓ ✗ 22.901 0.851 2.305 10.597\n✓ ✗ ✗ ✗ ✓ 22.225 0.835 3.978 16.645\n✗ ✓ ✗ ✗ ✓ 22.494 0.846 2.511 12.219\n✗ ✗ ✓ ✗ ✓ 22.949 0.862 2.415 11.774\n✗ ✗ ✗ ✓ ✓ 23.049 0.865 2.202 10.223\nFirst Encoding Block Last Decoding Block\n      Macro                     Micro\nInput-N1.5\n      Macro                     MicroInput-P1.5\nOutput-N1.5\nOutput-P1.5\nFigure 13: Visualization of heat maps from the first encoding\nblock and last decoding block.\n4.6 Feature map visualization\nTo further explain the role of multiple attention and hierarchical\nnetwork structure, we visualize the feature map after processing\nof the first block of the encoder in stage 1 and the last block of the\ndecoder in stage 3. The results are presented in the Figure 13. Long-\nrange dependencies appear after macro attention, while short-range\ndependencies appear after micro attention. This aids the network\nin adapting different adjustments based on varying semantics.\n5 CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we address the issues of inconsistent results and color\ndistortion in exposure correction tasks. To model long-range depen-\ndencies, a Macro-Micro attention mechanism has been developed,\nwhich significantly enhances image color and detail. A contrastive\nconstraint is then established to effectively resolve inconsistent cor-\nrection results. By integrating the advantages of both transformer\nand convolution, a four-stage pipeline is constructed, which further\nimproves the quality of corrected images. Our proposed model is\nassessed on multiple challenging exposure-error datasets and ap-\nplied as an enhancer for high-level tasks. Results demonstrate that\nour approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods,\nindicating its potential applicability in exposure-related tasks.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work is partially supported by the National Key R&D Pro-\ngram of China (No. 2022YFA1004101), the National Natural Science\nFoundation of China (No. U22B2052).\nFearless Luminance Adaptation: A Macro-Micro-Hierarchical Transformer for Exposure Correction MM ’23, October 29–November 3, 2023, Ottawa, ON, Canada.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Mahmoud Afifi, Konstantinos G Derpanis, Bjorn Ommer, and Michael S Brown.\n2021.
