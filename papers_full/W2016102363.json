    "abstract": "To increase energy-to-electron-beam transfer effectiveness accumulated in the double forming line of high-current electron accelerator, the matching transformer with outside magnetization placed between forming line and diode module was used. Transformer core saturation to line charging phase allows to decrease greatly pre-pulse amplitude and its influence on anode foil durability without switch sharpening application. Accelerator provides electron beam generation with pulse energy up to 200 J at electron kinetic energy 500 keV and pulse length 60 ns. Nanosecond voltage generator and explosive emission diode effectiveness were investigated.",
