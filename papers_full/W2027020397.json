In gen-\neral, MMCs require a buﬀer reactor in each arm, which increases the number of components required in the converter\nand the converter footprint. The proposed MMC with a three-winding transformer does not require buﬀer reactors. The\nmathematical representation of the proposed converter was ﬁrst described. The operational performance of the pro-\nposed MMC was found to be identical to the typical MMC (with the bu ﬀer reactor topology) by making comparisons\nin the experimental tests on two physical prototype converters rated at 10 kV A.\nKeywords: modular multilevel converter, high voltage direct current transmission, Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS)\n1. Introduction\nRecently, Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC) has been\nstudied (1)–(8). MMC consists of series connected half bridge\nconverters, so it enables voltage level and power ratings ad-\njustable. MMC can generate approximated sine wave out-\nput at AC terminal with reduced switching frequency of in-\ndividual power device. Moreover it does not require AC\nﬁlters if the number of levels is adequate. As MMC has\nthese advantages, researches are advancing to high voltage\napplications such as high voltage direct current transmission\n(HVDC)\n(9) (10), and it has been already operated in actual trans-\nmission systems (11) (12).\nThe reactors used in the typical MMC are of air core type,\njust like those used in the grid connected devices such as\nSVC (TCR) (13). This type of reactors has a very simple con-\nﬁguration so it can achieve low cost and remove the risk of\nmagnetic saturation. However, the air core reactor requires a\nwide clearance space in order to avoid electromagnetic inter-\nference. In this paper, a new type MMC which does not re-\nquire the buﬀer reactors in principle was proposed. As most\nof grid connected power electronic devices such as HVDC\nand FACTS require a transformer to obtain the optimal volt-\nage for power electronic switching devices to operate. By\napplying the three winding transformer, it is possible to elim-\ninates the buﬀer reactors, as the result, reduce the converter\nfootprint and the number of components of the converter. In\nthis paper, the equations of voltage and current relationship\na) Correspondence to: Shunsuke Tamada.

The experimental results by\nusing these prototypes MMC for the cases of grid connection\n(active power, reactive power operation) are presented.\n2. Modular Multilevel Converter with Three\nWinding Transformer\n2.1 Proposed Converter Topology A circuit dia-\ngram of the proposed converter topology is shown in Fig. 1.\nThree winding transformers are used within the cascaded half\nbridge MMC. There are three three-winding transformers for\nthree phase AC circuit. The primary windings of the trans-\nformers are connected to AC grid. Secondary and tertiary\nwindings are connected to converter upper arm and lower arm\nin each leg. These three windings are wrapped around a com-\nmon iron core. The secondary winding and the tertiary wind-\ning are wound in inverse direction, and the negative sides of\neach winding are connected each other. A connected point of\nsecondary and tertiary winding is center of each leg, which\nbecomes neutral point of the converter.\nIn MMC, a current in each arm contains two components,\nnamely the common component and the di ﬀerential compo-\nnent, between upper and lower arm\n(3)–(5). The common current\ncomponent ﬂows through both secondary and tertiary wind-\nings while the di ﬀerential current component ﬂows through\nonly one winding, secondary or tertiary. Figure 2 shows mag-\nnetomotive force due to the currents in secondary winding\nand tertiary winding in these two cases. In common current\ncomponent case, the direction of the magnetomotive force at\nthe secondary winding and the tertiary winding are in oppo-\nsite direction and therefore they are cancelled out each other.\nThe total magnetic ﬂux generated by the common current\ncomponent does not exist in the common iron core. In dif-\nferential current component case, the magnetomotive force\nof each winding is in the same direction, so they are added to\nc⃝2015 The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan. 611\nA Proposal of MMC Using Three-Winding TransformerʢShunsuke Tamada et al.ʣ\n(a) The arm conﬁguration of typical MMC\n(b) The arm conﬁguration of proposed MMC\n(c) Applied three winding transformer to MMC\nFig. 1.

The common current component is DC, the dif-\nferential current component is AC. Due to the cancellation of\nmagnetic ﬂux of the common current, it is possible to use a\nnormal three winding transformer without additional require-\nment for a bigger iron core. The magnetomotive force gener-\nated by the diﬀerential current component is cancelled by the\ncurrent in primary winding; this is just like what happens in\nan ordinary transformer.\nAs well known, transformer has leakage inductance. The\nleakage inductance between the secondary and the tertiary\nFig. 3. Flux ﬂow of three winding transformer\nwindings behaves like arm reactance. Thus, the proposed\ntopology does not require the bu ﬀer reactor. The functions\nof the arm reactance will be described in detail in the next\nchapter.\nMoreover, it is possible to connect all the midpoints of\nthe transformer to form a neutral point at the converter side.\nWhen this transformer neutral point is used as the neutral\npoint of the DC link, this topology constitutes a symmetrical\nmonopole in the applications like HVDC transmission sys-\ntem. When it is not connected to the ground, it constitutes an\nasymmetrical monopole or bi-pole HVDC transmission sys-\ntem.\n2.2 Description of Three Winding Transformer In\nthis chapter, the proposed three winding transformer is de-\nscribed mathematically. Figure 3 shows ﬂux ﬂow of the pro-\nposed transformer. The transformer model has common iron\ncore which is wrapped by three windings. The iron core\nbecomes common magnetic path, so magnetic ﬂux by each\nwinding interlinks between individual windings. Not only\nits ﬂux but also leakage ﬂux penetrates individual winding.\nTherefore, ﬂux linkage of each winding ϕ\np, ϕS, ϕT is given\nby Eq. (1).\n⎡⎢⎢\n⎢\n⎢\n⎢\n⎢\n⎢\n⎣\nϕ\np\nϕS\nϕT\n⎤⎥⎥\n⎥\n⎥\n⎥\n⎥\n⎥\n⎦ =\n⎡⎢⎢\n⎢\n⎢\n⎢\n⎢\n⎢\n⎣\nN\np 00\n0 NS 0\n00 NT\n⎤⎥⎥\n⎥\n⎥\n⎥\n⎥\n⎥\n⎦\n⎡⎢⎢\n⎢\n⎢\n⎢\n⎢\n⎢\n⎣\nφ\nlp\nφlS\nφlT\n⎤⎥⎥\n⎥\n⎥\n⎥\n⎥\n⎥\n⎦\n+\n⎡⎢⎢\n⎢\n⎢\n⎢\n⎢\n⎢\n⎣\nN\np Np Np\nNS NS NS\nNT NT NT\n⎤⎥⎥\n⎥\n⎥\n⎥\n⎥\n⎥\n⎦\n⎡⎢⎢\n⎢\n⎢\n⎢\n⎢\n⎢\n⎣\nφ\np\nφS\nφT\n⎤⎥⎥\n⎥\n⎥\n⎥\n⎥\n⎥\n⎦ ···················· (1)\nwhere N\np,S,T are number of turn in each winding, Φlp,lS,lT are\nleakage ﬂux, Φp,S,T are main ﬂux (passing through iron core)\nby each windings.\nWhen we deﬁne R to be magnetic resistance of magnetic\ncircuit through iron core, the main ﬂux of each winding is\nexpressed by (2) using the winding current i\nS,i T and the line\ncurrent is.\n612 IEEJ Journal IA, Vol.4, No.5, 2015\nA Proposal of MMC Using Three-Winding TransformerʢShunsuke Tamada et al.ʣ\n⎡⎢⎢\n⎢\n⎢\n⎢\n⎢\n⎢\n⎣\nϕ\np\nϕS\nϕT\n⎤⎥⎥\n⎥\n⎥\n⎥\n⎥\n⎥\n⎦ =\n⎡⎢⎢\n⎢\n⎢\n⎢\n⎢\n⎢\n⎣\nN\np 00\n0 NS 0\n00 NT\n⎤⎥⎥\n⎥\n⎥\n⎥\n⎥\n⎥\n⎦\n⎡⎢⎢\n⎢\n⎢\n⎢\n⎢\n⎢\n⎣\nφ\nlp\nφlS\nφlT\n⎤⎥⎥\n⎥\n⎥\n⎥\n⎥\n⎥\n⎦\n+1\nR\n⎡⎢⎢⎢\n⎢\n⎢\n⎢\n⎢\n⎣\n−N\np2ip +NpNS iS −NpNT iT\n−NS Npip +NS 2iS −NS NT iT\n−NT Npip +NT NS iS −NT 2iT\n⎤⎥⎥⎥\n⎥\n⎥\n⎥\n⎥\n⎦ ······ (2)\nSelf and mutual inductances of each winding depend on\nnumber of windings and magnetic resistance.

Few diﬀerences are only in the AC reactor and the out-\nput voltage which aﬀect on AC current. Hence, the proposed\nMMC with three winding transformer can operate as same\nas typical MMC.

It becomes\nDC current of proposed MMC. The leakage inductance of\nsecondary l\nS and tertiary lT behave buﬀer reactor. Therefore,\nthe proposed MMC with three winding transformer operates\nas same as typical MMC with buﬀer reactors.\n3. Experimental Results\nTwo prototype converters are connected to the same AC\npower supply point at the AC side and they are connected\nthrough a DC line at DC side, like back-to-back connection.\nThe parameters of the proposed prototype MMC are shown\nin Table 2.\nThe transformer used in the experimentation is shown in\nFig. 8. It is a normal single phase three winding transformer;\nits iron core has saturation magnetic density which is 1.85 [T]\nat 116% (233 V , 50 Hz) of rated voltage level. In rated voltage\n(200 V 50 Hz), the magnetic density of iron core is 1.59 [T].\nFigure 10 shows experimental results in grid connected op-\neration. In all results, good sinusoidal waveforms at AC line\ncurrent are obtained and the capacitor voltages of each cell\nare balanced each other. When converter and inverter op-\neration (Figs. 10 (a), (b)), the converter arm current has dc\ncomponent. However, the three winding transformer does\nnot occur magnetic saturation in both power ﬂow direction.\nWhen they were operated in reactive power mode as shown\nin Figs. 10(c), (d), the results are the same.\nFigure 11 shows experimental results in reversing power\nﬂow operation by back to back converter connection. The\nbehavior of converter is stable even in during power ﬂow di-\nrection changing.\nFigure 12 shows experimental results in fault ride through\noperation at AC line fault. A magnetic saturation does not\nappear even when AC line voltage is suddenly changing. As\nthese results, the proposed MMC with three winding trans-\nformer operates as same as typical MMC with bu ﬀer reac-\ntors. Furthermore, it does not adversely a ﬀect the DC bias\nmagnetism at the transformer to merge bu ﬀer reactor into a\ngrid connected transformer.\nTable 2. Parameter of the MMC prototype\nFig. 8. The three winding transformer (single phase)\nFig. 9. The prototype converter\nIn this experiment, three single phase three-winding trans-\nformers are applied. However, it can also use three phase\nthree winding transformer which has three-leg iron core or\nﬁve-leg iron core. When the three phase transformer is used,\nthe primary winding and the secondary winding and the ter-\ntiary winding should be wounded to the same leg for each\nphase, and a magnetomotive force by common current com-\nponent should be cancelled like a single phase three winding\ntransformer.\n4. Conclusions\nA new type of Modular Multilevel Converter using a three\nwinding transformer was proposed in this paper. The pro-\nposed circuitry merges the bu ﬀer reactors into converter\ntransformer, so as to save the space and components of con-\nverter. Since DC ﬂux is cancelled on the same core within\nthe three winding transformer, it does not adversely aﬀect the\nDC bias magnetism at the transformer, and therefore, the pro-\nposed MMC with three winding transformer does not require\nany special duty for magnetic density to the transformer\nThe experiment conducted on physical 10 kV A prototype\nconverters shows that the proposed converter had the same\n616 IEEJ Journal IA, Vol.4, No.5, 2015\nA Proposal of MMC Using Three-Winding TransformerʢShunsuke Tamada et al.ʣ\n(a) when the direction of power ﬂow is AC to DC\n(b) when the direction of power ﬂow is DC to AC\n(c) in reactive power lagging operration\n(d) in reacitve power leading operation\nFig. 10.
