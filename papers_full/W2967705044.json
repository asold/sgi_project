First, transformers are one of the main elements in the power supply system that allow \nconverting the voltage of the electric current, and secondly, these devices belong to the \n                                                        \n* Corresponding author: ja_deva@mail.ru \n  , 0 2019)E3S Web of Conferences https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf  /2019(110 1100\n-2018\n10 10\nSPbWOSCE\n26 26\n  © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

That`s wh y untimely failure of \nthem can significantly negatively affect the energy supply and the financial status of enter-\nprises [4-6]. \nThe main failures of transformers are due to damage to the insulation system. It should \nbe noted that insulating oil provides the greatest electrical strength in transformers. The low \nviscosity of oil allows it to penetrate into the solid insulation and remove the heat, transfer-\nring it to the cooling system. Stabilization of oils from oxidation allows them to work at \nhigh temperature and for a long time protects the insulation system from serious failures. \nHowever, when oxygen and water appear in the insulating oil, it is oxidized even under \nideal conditions. The condition of insulating oil is also affected by various contaminants  \nfrom solid materials of the transformer, which dissolve in the oil. As a result of the reac-\ntions that occur in the oil between unstable hydrocarbons, oxygen and water with the help \nof such accelerator as heat, the oil is oxidized, leading to its ageing and deterioration, which \nincreases the load on the transformer insulation system. Insulation winding with 1% of \nmoisture increases the ageing process by 10 times faster than with the moisture content of \n0.1%. Oxidation of the oil cannot be eliminated, but it  can be controlled or slowed down \nthrough the maintenance process. One of the main provisions in the maintenance of the \ntransformer is annual check of the oil. When the moisture is revealed, it is very important to \neliminate it in a timely manner, as well as to maintain the low degree of moisture for insula-\ntion [7-10]. \n2 Issues to be studied \nThe purpose of this paper is to study the removal of moisture from the insulating transform-\ner oil. A variety of technological operations are used to restore the spent oils. They involve \nthe treatment of oils in order to remove the aging products and contaminants from them. \nThe simplest and least cost-intensive methods of removing the water and various impurities \nfrom oils are physical methods of purification. The essenc e of these methods is the oil \ntreatment, using gravitational, centrifugal, electric, magnetic and vibration forces. Also \nphysical purification methods include various mass and heat exchange processes. Among \nthem, the simplest method is sedimentation, based on the process of natural settling of me-\nchanical particles, impurities and water under the action of gravitational forces. However, \nthe main disadvantage of this method is the long duration period of the process, during \nwhich the spent oil is cleaned. The refore, the development of new purification devices in \norder to remove various impurities and moisture from the oil is relevant [11-14]. \nThe authors of this paper propose to use the developed rectangular separator in order to \nremove the moisture and impurities of different density than the transformer oil. The devel-\noped rectangular separator belongs to transformer oil regeneration devices and can be used \nat the enterprises of energy, electric and transformer stations and facilities, which use the \ntransformer oil. A significant advantage of the developed separator is the spent oil treat-\nment speed, which is equal to 1 –2 m/s. For example, the same speed in decanting tanks is \nby 15–200 times lower [15-18]. \nThe rectangular separator has a simple and compact desig n, consisting of several rows \nof U-shaped elements, assembled into a rectangular case [19, 20]. There are inlet and outlet \nnozzles from both parallel sides of device, designed for the input of spent contaminated oil \nand the output of contaminants from the separator, respectively. Within the bottom of sepa-\nrator, along the middle row of U-shaped elements, there are two holes, serving for output of \nthe purified transformer oil from device (Fig. 1). In order to increase the design strength, U-\nshaped elements ar e connected with each other by single transverse plate, located at the \nsame distance from the lower and upper walls of the separator, which is fixed to the case of \ndevice. \n  , 0 2019)E3S Web of Conferences https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf  /2019(110 1100\n-2018\n10 10\nSPbWOSCE\n26 26\n2\n \nFig. 1. Simplified model of rectangular separator: 1 – inlet nozzle, 2 – U-shaped elements, 3 – case of \nrectangular separator, 4 – holes for the outlet of purified transformer oil, 5 – outlet nozzle (top view). \nOperation principle of this separator is based on the use of centrifugal force. When the \ncontaminated transformer oil moves inside of the separator between U-shaped elements 2, \nthe centrifugal force arises and divides the flow into different fractions, depending on their \ndensity. Also, additional separation of emulsion is facilitated by direct conta ct between the \noil and the walls of separator`s elements  2. After the processes of contaminated oil separa-\ntion into different fractions, the purified transformer oil moves into the executed holes 4, \nwhile various impurities and water are removed through th e outlet nozzle 5 (Fig. 1). In-\ncrease in the number of rows of U-shaped elements inside of the separator contributes to the \nincrease in the efficiency of the contaminated oil purification. \n3 Methods of study \nIn order to calculate the process of removing the  moisture from transformer insulating oil, \nthe multiphase Eulerian -Eulerian model “Volume of Fluid” with the number of phases \nequal to 2 was applied in ANSYS Fluent software package. In the course of numerical sim-\nulation, the object of study was the transf ormer oil T -1500U, containing some water \namount. It should be noted that this type of transformer oil is widely used in Russia as the \nmain electrical insulating material for filling the phase -shifting, furnace, grounding trans-\nformers. The volume ratios of water and oil T -1500U in the multiphase flow were taken \nequal to 0.5 each. Some other constant parameters were also set, namely: ambient tempera-\nture t0 = 20°C; water density ρ H20 = 998 .2 kg/m 3; water viscosity coefficient µ H2O = \n0.001003 Pa·s; transformer oil density ρoil = 883 kg/m3; transformer oil viscosity coefficient \nµoil = 0 .0198 Pa·s. In the course of study, the height H of separator was changed in the \nrange of 10 –70 mm, and the distance between the rows of U-shaped elements h was also \nchanged in the same range. When one parameter was changed, another was set to the base \nvalue. Base values were the following: separator height H = 30 mm and the distance be-\ntween rows of U-shaped elements h = 30 mm. K–ε turbulence model was used for the cal-\nculations. \nThe results were obtained while solving the nonstationary issue. In the course of numer-\nical simulation, the following boundary conditions were set: the inlet rate values ( “velocity \ninlet”) at the inlet nozzle of the rectangular separator was set in the range of 1–2 m/s; the \natmospheric pressure was set equal to 10 5 Pa at the outlet nozzle and within the holes for \nthe outlet of purified transformer oil; and other boundaries had the “wall” condition Diame-\nters of the outlet holes were taken equal to 2.25 mm. Two values were changed in the \ncourse of study, namely, the distance between the rows of U-shaped elements and the \nheight of the rectangular separator. When the height of the rectangular separator was \nchanged, also the height of U-shaped elements changed proportionally. \nThe efficiency of transformer oil purification from moisture was determined by the fol-\nlowing formula: \n  , 0 2019)E3S Web of Conferences https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf  /2019(110 1100\n-2018\n10 10\nSPbWOSCE\n26 26\n3\n \n oil-outlet1 100%EC , (1) \nwhere Coil-outlet – oil volume ratio in the outlet nozzle.  \nAlso the Reynolds number was determined in the course of studies as follows: \n \nRe ν hWh , (2) \nwhere Wh – multiphase flow rate within the narrowest places between U-shaped elements, \nm/s; h – distance between the rows of U-shaped elements, m; ν – kinematic viscosity of \ntransformer oil, m2/s. \n4 Results of studies and discussion of them \nThe results of studies are shown graphically in Fig. 2 -4. Numerical studies showed that the \nuse of a rectang ular separator in order to remove the moisture from transformer oil allows \npurifying it by 99 .99% providing that the geometrical dimensions of device are chosen \ncorrectly. \nThe separation process of water -oil emulsion is shown in Fig. 2. Due to the effect o f \ncentrifugal force on the multiphase flow during its movement between U-shaped elements \nof the separator, and when the water -oil emulsion directly contacted with elements of de-\nvice, liquid was divided into two fractions: water and oil. Due to the fact that the oil density \nis less than the water density, after the emulsion separation process completion, it rushed to \nthe bottom of device and went out of the separator through special holes (Fig. 2). \n \nFig. 2. Water-oil emulsion separation process inside of the rectangular separator. \nIn the process of studying the removal of moisture from the transformer oil by means of \na rectangular separator, the movement of water -oil emulsion in the opposite direction was \nalso considered. In other words, the contaminated oil was fed into the rectangular separator \nin such a way that the oil moved inside of U-shaped elements. It was assumed that such \nflow movement would increase the efficiency of the water -oil emulsion separation into \nfractions due to the formation of additional reverse flows inside of U-shaped elements, but \nthe numerical calculations showed that the emulsion separation efficiency in such a way \nwas by 10–20% lower than at the flow movement, shown in Fig. 1. Also, such movement \ncontributes to an increase in the hydraulic resistance of the device due to the reverse flows \ninside of U-shaped elements. \n  , 0 2019)E3S Web of Conferences https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf  /2019(110 1100\n-2018\n10 10\nSPbWOSCE\n26 26\n4\n \nFig. 3. Dependency of the water-oil emulsion separation efficiency inside of the separator on Reyn-\nolds number at the following height of device H, mm: 1 – 10; 2 – 15; 3 – 20; 4 – 30; 5 – 50; 6 – 60; 7 \n– 70. \nThe greatest efficiency of purifying the insulating transformer oil from moisture was \nobserved at the studied height of device of 50 mm. At this height, the efficiency of rectan-\ngular separator was E = 99.99%. When the height of device was 70, 40, 30, 20, 15 and 10 \nmm, the efficiency was on the average equal to 97,4%, 92,4%, 96,2%, 83,3%, 88,4% and \n63.9% respectively. Purification of transformer oil with such efficiency is not satisfactory \ndue to the fact that even an increase in moisture by less than 1% of the existing amount \nsignificantly affects its insulation characteristics. There is an option of several ci rcles for \ncontaminated transformer oil through the separator with a height of less than 50 mm, how-\never, this will extend the oil purification time period. Therefore, the most rational option is \nto increase the height of device up to 50 mm. With an increase  in the height of separator \n(more than 50 mm), the efficiency also decreases due to the deviation of the vortex axis \nfrom the straight line (Fig. 3). \nIt should be noted that the change in Reynolds number, which is determined by the Eq. \n(2), is affected onl y by the flow rate within the narrowest places between U-shaped ele-\nments, while other parameters remain constant. Thus, the separation efficiency of the water-\noil emulsion is high and at average is equal to 99.9%, when the values of Reynolds number \nare in the range of 306–611, which correspond to the inlet flow rates – 1–2 m/s for the sepa-\nrator with the height of 50 mm (Fig. 3). \nThe separation efficiency of the water -oil emulsion is significantly affected by the dis-\ntance between the rows of U-shaped elements. As a rule, when this distance is increased up \nto 30 mm, the efficiency of emulsion separation also increases. This situation is clearly \nobserved on the 4th line in Fig. 4, corresponding to the inlet flow rate w = 2 m/s. \n  , 0 2019)E3S Web of Conferences https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf  /2019(110 1100\n-2018\n10 10\nSPbWOSCE\n26 26\n5\n \nFig. 4. Dependency of the water-oil emulsion separation efficiency inside of the separator on the \ndistance between the rows of elements h at the inlet flow rate w, m/s: 1 – 1; 2 – 1.5; 3 – 1.8; 4 – 2. \nMaximum efficiency of liquid separation, equal to 99.99%, is achieved when the dis-\ntance between the rows of U-shaped elements is h = 30 mm, and for almost any inlet rate in \nthe range of 1–2 m/s. However, when the inlet flow rate is 1.8 m/s, the separation efficiency \nis equal to 86.2%, but it can be assumed that this value is fluctuating due to the fact that the \nseparation efficiency is equal to 99 .99% in both cases (Fig.  4) at the inlet rates of 1 .7 and \n1.9 m/s. \nIn the course of studies, it was found that t he use of a rectangular separator, when the \ninlet rates of water -oil emulsion are in the range of 1 –2 m/s, allows it to be purified from \nwater by 99.99%, providing that the height of device is 50 mm and the distance between the \nrows of U-shaped elements is equal to 30 mm, respectively. \n5 Conclusion \nThe use of developed rectangular separator can be an alternative to the use of decanting \ntanks, various separators and other purification devices, which have extremely low rate of \npurification of contaminated waste oils. The developed separator allows purifying the trans-\nformer oil from water with a speed of 1–2 m/s while the efficiency is equal to 99.99%. The \nsignificant advantages of the rectangular separator are the following: compactness, small \ndimensions, high efficiency, easy to use and manufacture. \nThe study was carried out with funding from the grant of the President of the Russian Federation \nNo. MK-4522.2018.8. \nReferences \n1.
