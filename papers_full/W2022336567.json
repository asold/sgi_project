We investigated the activity of corticospinal\nneurons in the primary motor cortex hand area during the use of a tool by two adult macaque monkeys. They used a light rake to retrieve\nfood rewards placed in their extrapersonal space. An analysis of EMG activity showed that the rake task involved a complex interaction of\nmuscles acting on the digits, hand, and arm. Sixty-nine corticospinal neurons were identified antidromically as pyramidal tract neurons\n(PTNs). When tested on the rake task, most (64 of 69; 93%) showed a significant modulation of their discharge during at least one of three\ntask periods: grasping the rake, projecting it beyond the food reward, and then pulling it back to retrieve the reward. Discharge patterns\nwere heterogeneous, and many PTNs showed significant suppression of discharge during raking. Seventeen of the 69 PTNs recorded\nduring the rake task were further identified as CM cells, exerting clear postspike facilitation on digit muscles, demonstrating that the CM\nsystem contributes to the skilled use of tools. We compared the activity of each PTN on the rake task with that during precision grip. Most\nPTNs (90%) modulated their activity significantly for both tasks, demonstrating that PTNs activated by a task involving fractionated\nmovements of the digits are also recruited during rake use, although there were often contrasting patterns of PTN recruitment and muscle\nactivity for the two tasks.\nIntroduction\nIn primates, the primary motor cortex (M1) (Brodmann area 4) is\nthe major contributor to the corticospinal tract, the major descend-\ning pathway influencing skilled hand movements, and damage to\nthese structures by stroke or spinal injury has devastating conse-\nquences for all those functions that depend on control of the hand\n(Lawrence and Kuypers, 1968; Dum and Strick, 1991; Porter and\nLemon, 1993). A subset of corticospinal projections make direct,\ncortico-motoneuronal (CM) connections with spinal motoneurons\n(Porter and Lemon, 1993; Lemon, 2008), and these connections,\nwhich are unique to primates (Lemon and Griffiths, 2005), are\nchiefly derived from M1 (Rathelot and Strick, 2006, 2009).\nThere is considerable evidence that those primate species with\na well-developed corticospinal system, including CM projec-\ntions, are characterized by the ability to perform fine motor skills\nusing independent finger movements (Heffner and Masterton,\n1975; Lemon and Griffiths, 2005). Some of the more dexterous\nprimates use tools (Chiang, 1967; Visalberghi et al., 1995; van\nSchaik et al., 1999; Gumert et al., 2009) defined as the manipula-\ntion of an object to change the position or form of another object\n(Beck, 1980). It has been speculated that the development of the\nCM system was part of the evolutionary change that led to im-\nproved dexterity (Phillips, 1971; Maier et al., 2005), providing\none important capacity that contributed to tool use and manu-\nfacture in primates (van Schaik et al., 1999). It is now well estab-\nlished that captive macaque monkeys can learn to use a rake as a\ntool, using it to retrieve food rewards placed just beyond their\nreach (Warden et al., 1940; Shurcliff et al., 1971; Iriki et al., 1996).\nThe task developed by Iriki and colleagues has allowed a number\nof the sensorimotor mechanisms involved in tool use to be ex-\nplored for the first time (Obayashi et al., 2002; Hihara et al., 2006;\nQuallo et al., 2009).\nIt is known that corticospinal neurons, including those with\nCM connections, are recruited during relatively independent fin-\nger movements, such as the precision grip (Muir and Lemon,\n1983; Maier et al., 1993; Bennett and Lemon, 1996; Schieber and\nRivlis, 2005). However, evidence of corticospinal involvement in\ntool use is so far lacking. A specific objective of this study was to\ninvestigate whether identified corticospinal neurons recorded in\nmacaque M1 hand area showed a comparable level of activity\nduring the rake task as during precision grip. We initially identi-\nfied corticospinal neurons as pyramidal tract neurons (PTNs) by\ntheir antidromic response to stimulation of the medullary pyra-\nReceived March 1, 2012; revised Sept. 11, 2012; accepted Sept. 13, 2012.\nAuthor contributions: R.N.L. designed research; M.M.Q., A.K., and R.N.L. performed research; M.M.Q., A.K., and\nR.N.L. analyzed data; M.M.Q., A.K., and R.N.L. wrote the paper.\nThis study was supported by The Wellcome Trust.

We compared the\ndischarge of each PTN on the rake task\nwith that recorded while monkeys per-\nformed a precision grip between index\nfinger and thumb. M1 PTNs that are re-\ncruited during the latter are presumably\nconcerned with movements of the most\ndistal parts of the limb and include CM\ncells projecting directly to motoneurons\ninnervating digit muscles (Lemon, 2008).\nIt was of interest to discover whether these\nPTNs were also activated during the rake\ntask, which involves movement of both\nthe proximal (shoulder and elbow) and\ndistal (hand and digits) limb. We found\nthat almost all PTNs, including 17 that\nwere confirmed to be CM cells, were as\nstrongly recruited on the precision grip\ntask as on the rake task, confirming the\ninvolvement of the primate CM system in\nthe use of a tool.\nMaterials and Methods\nMonkeys\nTwo adult purpose-bred Rhesus ( Macaca\nmulatta ) monkeys [M41 (monkey R), male, 5\nyears old, 7.8 kg; and M43 (monkey E), fe-\nmale, 6 years old, 5.1 kg] were used. All ex-\nperimental procedures were approved by the\nLocal Ethical Procedures committee and per-\nformed in accordance with the United King-\ndom Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act.\nMonkeys were trained to perform both the\nrake and the precision grip tasks with the left\nhand. Monkeys were trained for several\nmonths (in M41, 7 months; M43, 9 months)\nbefore recordings began.\nFigure 1. Rake task.A, Photograph of M43 holding the rake. Note the grasp used, with the shaft of the rake held between the\nflexed thumb and the other digits. A food reward was placed at a target position on the table (black circle at bottom right), and a\nsensor device was embedded in the table below the target.B, Table used for the rake task. The experimenter sat on the far side of\nthe table (62/H1100368 cm) facing the monkey. The monkey raked with its left hand and rested its right hand on block B. On the\nexperimenter’s side of the table (gray zone) were three home-pad (HP) pressure sensors. At the beginning of each trial, the\nexperimenter positioned the rake (dashed outline) close to the monkey’s left hand. An LED above one of the home pads indicated\nwhich target should be baited for the next trial: left (L), right (R), and central (C) to the monkey. Targets were selected in a\nrandomized sequence. The experimenter, holding the food reward for that trial, rested her hand on the appropriate home pad. A\ntone sound cued the experimenter to place the food at the instructed target. Targets were positioned in an arc (gray dashed line)\n/H1101142 cm from the monkey on a section of the table that was slightly raised by 2.2 mm. Once the food reward was placed at a target,\nthe monkey picked up the rake and used it to retrieve the reward. Passage of the rake head over the target was detected by\nmagnetic sensors underneath each target. The traces superimposed over the table surface show the trajectory of the monkey’s\nhand from the start of the trial to the maximum reach position in a single recording session (monkey M43); these traces were\n4\nderived from markers on the back of the monkey’s hand that\nwere captured with a digital video camera mounted above the\nraking table. C, Different periods of the rake task. Period 1\n(Baseline) began after the experimenter had placed a reward\nat one of the targets and depressed the home pad. This period\nstarted 750 ms before the experimenter released her hand\nfrom the home pad; during this baseline period, the monkey\nwas required not to move. Period 2 (Rake pick-up) began\nwhen the experimenter released the home pad and uncovered\nthe reward, which cued the monkey to pick up the rake from its\nstart location (approximate position indicated by dashed line).\nThis period was defined as occupying the first half of the inter-\nval between HPR and the sensor signal and lasted/H11011350 –500\nms. Period 3 (Reach & swing) was defined as taking up the\nsecond half of this interval. During this period, the monkey\nextended the rake, lifted it over the raised section, and swung\nthe head of the rake behind the reward. The food reward is\nshown as a black square over the target (black circle). Period 4\n(Return, rake crosses sensor) was defined as lasting from the\ntime the rake head crossed the sensor to 250 ms later. Period 5\n(Food pick-up) was defined as lasting for the period 250 to\n1000 ms after the rake crossed the sensor; the monkey re-\nleased the rake and collected the reward with the same (left)\nhand.

Neurosci., November 28, 2012• 32(48):17351–17364 Quallo, Kraskov et al. • Corticospinal Activity and Tool Use\nRake task\nA white worktable, 62/H1100368 cm, placed in front of the monkey at waist\nheight, was used (Fig. 1B). The monkey was trained to use its left hand to\npick up a light rake and use it to retrieve food rewards placed just beyond\nits peripersonal space. The rake (Fig. 1A) had a 30 cm shaft and a 10/H110036\ncm rectangular head, and it weighed 38 g. A small food reward could be\nplaced over one of three targets on a slightly raised section (2.2 mm\nheight) of the table, 42 cm from the monkey’s side of the table. The targets\nlay to the right (Fig. 1B, R), left (L), and directly ahead of the monkey\n(center, C). The left and right targets subtended an angle of/H1101126\no to the\nmonkey. Under each target lay a magnetic sensor. When the rake head,\nwhich carried a number of small magnets, passed over one of these sen-\nsors, a pulse was generated. The experimenter’s section of the table (Fig.\n1B, shaded area at top) carried three home-pad pressure sensors that\nwere located just beyond the three targets and were operated by the\nexperimenter. Next to each pressure sensor was an LED, not visible to the\nmonkey, which was used to indicate the pseudorandom order in which\nthe targets were baited for each trial. A small round block (Fig. 1B,B )w a s\nprovided on the right side of the worktable for the monkey to rest its\nnon-raking hand.\nAt the beginning of each trial, the experimenter positioned the rake\nclose to the monkey’s left hand (approximate position indicated by\ndashed outline inFig. 1B) and then placed a small food reward on the\ntarget indicated by the LED; the experimenter depressed the home pad,\nkeeping the food covered with her fingers. Aftera1s delay (mean over\nsessions, 1.09 s), a tone cued the experimenter to simultaneously release\nher hand from the home pad and remove her hand from the food (Fig.\n1C, period 1). This was in turn the cue for the monkey to pick up the rake,\nlift the head of the rake over the raised section of the table, swing it just\nbeyond the reward, and then pull the rake to retrieve the reward (Fig. 1C,\nMonkey action, periods 2– 4). An event pulse was generated as the rake\nhead was pulled over the sensor. The monkey then released the rake,\npicked up the food reward with its left hand (Fig. 1C, period 5), and\ntransferred it to its mouth. The experimenter then replaced the rake in its\nstart position. The next trial began after the monkey had eaten the reward\nand returned its hand to the worktable, resting it close to the rake and\nawaiting the experimenter’s cue for the trial to start. A digital video\ncamera mounted above the table was used to monitor the monkey’s\nperformance on the task.\nPrecision grip task\nBoth monkeys were also trained to use a precision grip manipulandum,\nusing the index finger and thumb to squeeze two spring-loaded levers\n(Baker et al., 2001). The levers were mounted in a manipulandum posi-\ntioned just in front of the monkey. Monkeys were trained to move each\nlever independently into a target zone (defined electronically) and hold it\nthere for 1s. Target positions were/H110116 –9 mm from the start position, and\nthe force needed to hold them in this position was/H110110.3 N. This hold\nperiod generated an “end-hold” pulse and cued the monkey to release the\nlevers. On completion of a successful trial, the monkey was rewarded by\nthe experimenter with a piece of food. Monkeys were not rewarded on\nevery trial for this task and would perform two or three trials before\nreceiving a reward.\nStructural MRI\nA structural MRI scan of each monkey was obtained in the early stages of\ntraining. Monkeys were scanned under deep ketamine/domitor anesthe-\nsia. Monkeys were placed in a plastic stereotaxic head holder. The scans\nwere performed on a GE Signa 1.5 T scanner with circular receiving\nsurface head coils and using spin echo (2D) and gradient echo (3D vol-\nume) during data acquisition. Voxel dimensions were 0.7/H110030.7 /H110030.7\nmm. During scanning, heart and respiration rates and end-tidal pCO\n2\nwere monitored continuously. Using custom-made software (3D Work-\nstation, Medical Graphics, University College London), a 3D rendering\nof the calvarium surface was created. In addition, a 3D rendering of the\ncortical surface was created that was used to guide the placement of\nrecording chambers and aided the planning of electrode penetrations.\nSurgical implantation\nMonkeys underwent three main surgical procedures, all performed in asep-\ntic conditions under deep anesthesia induced with ketamine/domitor (intra-\nmuscularly) and maintained with 2–2.5% isoflurane in 50:50 O\n2/N2O. The\nfirst surgery was the implantation of a headpiece: in M41 this was made of\nstainless steel and in M43 from Tecapeek. Tecapeek is a high-strength bio-\ncompatible and MR-compatible thermoplastic, and this headpiece was cus-\ntom fitted to the skull surface using the MRI-based model.\nThe second surgery was the implantation of 12 chronic EMG patch\nelectrodes sutured over hand, arm, and digit muscles on the left side: first\ndorsal interosseous (1DI), thenar, abductor digiti minimi, flexor digito-\nrum profundus (FDP), flexor carpi ulnaris, flexor carpi radialis (FCR),\nFigure 2. EMG activity during task. Rectified, smoothed (low-pass filter, 30 Hz) and aver-\naged EMG from eight muscles referenced to the moment the rake crossed the right sensor (time\n0) are shown (n /H1100530 trials); EMG amplitude has been normalized to the maximum EMG for\neach muscle. In the bottom trace are signals indicating diagrammatically when the experiment-\ner’s home pad was pressed (HPP) and then released (HPR) and when the rake head passed over\nthe sensor. Because of trial-by-trial variation in the timing of these events, the events shown\nhere and the gray scale bar (at top and bottom) indicating the task periods 1–5 (seeFig. 1C) are\nan idealized representation.\nQuallo, Kraskov et al.• Corticospinal Activity and Tool Use J.

(2004).\nThe third surgery involved the mounting of a\nrecording chamber (20/H1100310 mm) positioned\nto give access to both the F5 hand area (inferior\nlimb of arcuate sulcus) and the M1 hand area\n(middle third of the central sulcus) in the right\nhemisphere. The top of the chamber was/H110115–7\nmm above the exposed dura. The right medul-\nlary pyramid was chronically implanted with a\npair of fine tungsten stimulating electrodes, for\nsubsequent antidromic identification of PTNs\nduring recording sessions ( Kraskov et al.,\n2009). The final position of the electrodes was\nadjusted for the lowest threshold antidromic\nvolley recorded from the ipsilateral M1 (M41,\n20 and 20\n/H9262A and M43, 22 and 45/H9262A for pos-\nterior and anterior electrodes, respectively).\nRecording\nA 16-channel Thomas Recording drive was\nused. Three to five glass-insulated platinum\nelectrodes (shank diameter, 80\n/H9262m) were\nloaded into the drive; the inter-electrode spac-\ning was 300\n/H9262m. The drive was securely fixed to\nthe metal rig in which the monkey sat. At the\nbeginning of each recording session, the ste-\nreotaxic position of the drive was calculated\nusing up to five fiducial markers on the cham-\nber lid. The surface location of the penetration\nwas calculated and marked on a computer-\ngenerated chamber map, which was based on\nmeasurements made at surgery of the stereo-\ntaxic coordinates of the fiducial markers. Ste-\nreotaxic measurements of central and arcuate\nsulci determined from MRI and at surgery were\nsuperimposed on the same chamber map. Af-\nter preamplification (20/H11003; Thomas Recording\ndrive), the signals from each electrode were\nfurther amplified (typically 500/H11003or 1000/H11003)\nand bandpass filtered (0.3– 6 kHz). Data were\nacquired using an analog-to-digital card (PCI-\n6071E; National Instruments) at 25 kHz sam-\npling rate and were recorded together with\nEMG activity sampled at 5 kHz and experi-\nmental events, including home pad, sensor sig-\nnals, and digit position sampled at 1 kHz. After\nrecording a full set of data, intracortical micro-\nstimulation (ICMS) was delivered to the elec-\ntrode at the same depth at which recordings\nwere made. An isolated stimulator (Neurolog\nNL800 stimulus isolator; Digitimer) delivered\ntrains of repetitive ICMS through each record-\ning electrode (13 pulses at 333 Hz, intensity\ntypically up to 40\n/H9262A, duty cycle of 0.5 Hz).\nAfter each recording session, the exposed dura\nwas briefly (5 min) covered with a solution of\n5-fluorouracil (Faulding Pharmaceuticals) to\nreduce growth of fibroblasts and the resulting\naccumulation of tough connective tissue on the\ndura (Spinks et al., 2003).\nSelection of neurons and identification of PTNs\nThe selection of neurons for recording was based entirely on their anti-\ndromic identification as PTNs and not on their activity during the\ntrained tasks. At the beginning of each session, a 250 –300\n/H9262A search\nstimulus (biphasic pulse; each phase, 0.2 ms) was applied to the pyrami-\ndal tract electrodes, and each electrode advanced until a PTN was de-\ntected. PTNs were identified by the invariant latency (jitter/H110210.1 ms) of\nits antidromic response to the pyramidal tract shock and by a collision\ntest (Kraskov et al., 2009). We then recorded from each PTN during both\nFigure 3. Two typical patterns of PTN activity during the rake task. Rasters and perievent histograms show activity for two PTNs\nrecorded in monkey M41 during the rake task [PTN R58, 85 trials (A) and PTN R50, 88 trials (B)]. Data are shown for raking trials\ninvolving all three targets and referenced to the moment the rake crossed a target sensor (time 0 with vertical line). The circles on\nthe left side of the rasters and the vertical line in the histograms indicate the moment at which the experimenter released the home\npad (HPR). The approximate time course of the different periods of the task are indicated by the gray scale bar beneath the rasters\n(see Fig. 2). For the PTN inA, discharge began when the monkey picked up the rake (period 2) and peaked during rake reach and\nswing (period 3). The PTN inB had a high level of baseline activity that was suppressed during rake pickup (period 2) and stopped\nfiring during rake reach (3), then followed by a burst of activity in the later stages of the rake return and food pickup (periods 4 and\n5). In the rasters, trials have been reordered according to target (top, right target; middle, center target; and bottom, right target;\nhorizontal black line indicates change of target location). PTN R58 showed no position sensitivity (p /H110050.41), whereas R50 did\n( p /H110050.013).

The antidromic responses of the PTN were checked regularly\n(see Results).\nAnalyses\nSpike discrimination.Spikes from PTNs were discriminated and identi-\nfied online, during the experiment. After the experiment, all spike wave-\nforms were reanalyzed and sorted into different classes attributed to separate\nsingle neurons using the clustering method based on the “Wave_clus” soft-\nware (Quian Quiroga et al., 2004), which runs under Matlab. Criteria for\ndiscrimination of spikes were the same as those used byKraskov et al. (2009).\nStatistical analyses of firing rate.We rejected trials that had either too\nlong or too short an interval between the home-pad release (HPR) signal\nand rake sensor signal. All trials that were outside the three interquartile\ndistance from the median were rejected. This resulted in rejection of\n/H110117% of trials. Perievent histograms of spike activity (150 ms bin width,\nwith a 50 ms sliding window) were constructed with reference to differ-\nent task events. The rake task was separated into a baseline period and\nfour different task periods (seeFigs. 1C, 2 and Results). The food pickup\nperiod (period 5) was also included in the analysis. A two-way ANOVA\nwas performed on average firing rate per task period as the dependent\nvariable and task period (five) and position of food on the raking table\n(three) as fixed factors for each PTN.Post hoc ttest tests with a Bonfer-\nroni’s correction were used to identify any period that was significantly\ndifferent from the baseline period. The depth of modulation of firing rate\nfor each task period was estimated as the mean percentage increase (MPI)\nfrom the baseline rate for each 150 ms bin, and the period with the\nhighest MPI was determined. Similarly, for neurons exhibiting a reduc-\ntion in firing rate during the task, the mean percentage suppression\n(MPS) was calculated for each 150 ms bin, and the period with the lowest\nMPS was identified. To compare firing rate modulation in the rake task\nwith that in the precision grip task, for each task period, the 150 ms\nbin with the average highest mean firing rate was identified and com-\npared with the baseline period; for technical reasons, the baseline period\nfrom the rake task was used for estimating firing rate modulation for both\ntasks.\nCross-correlation functions.We used the methods described byHold-\nefer and Miller (2002)and Jackson et al. (2007)to compute the cross-\ncorrelation functions (CCFs) for each of the PTNs for which/H110222000\nspikes were available. The EMGs were rectified and low-pass filtered (20\nHz, Butterworth second order) to extract the modulation envelop. Aver-\nage spike count in non-overlapping 10 ms bins and average EMG in the\nsame bin were used to compile CCFs for a period 1 s before and after\nspike discharge (seeFig. 8A). We also computed the correlation between\nCCFs for spike and EMG data recorded during rake versus precision grip\ntasks (indicated by the term “rr”).\nSpike-triggered averaging (STA) for each PTN was performed using all\ndiscriminated PTN spikes and EMGs recorded during both the rake and\nprecision grip task tasks. The identification of CM cells used the criteria\nused in previous studies from this laboratory (Lemon et al., 1986; Baker\nand Lemon, 1995; Bennett and Lemon, 1996). The EMG from each mus-\ncle recorded simultaneously with the PTN was full-wave rectified and\naveraged with respect to spike discharge over a period/H1100220 ms before and\n40 ms after spike discharge. Averages were compiled with a minimum of\n2000 spikes.\nHistology\nAt the end of the experiment, each monkey was killed by an overdose of\npentobarbitone (50 mg/kg, i.p., Euthanal; Rhone Merieux) and perfused\nthrough the heart.

Histological analysis\nconfirmed the location of the implanted electrode tips within the pyra-\nmidal tract (Kraskov et al., 2009).\nResults\nPerformance on the rake task\nMonkeys typically completed/H11011300 trials on the rake task in a\nrecording session, with each trial lasting /H110113 s. The monkey\ngripped the shaft of the rake in the palm of its left hand, curling\nthe thumb and fingers around the shaft (Fig. 1A). Figure 1B\nshows the trajectories of the monkey’s hand while raking from\nthe three different targets in a single session. Reaches to the right\ntarget were therefore directed medially, whereas those to the left\ntarget were directed laterally. The trajectory was quite variable\nfrom trial to trial and covered a large proportion of the raking\ntable. Each trial was separated into five different periods, as indi-\ncated inFigure 1C: baseline (period 1), rake pick-up (period 2),\nreach and swing of the rake head to place it behind the food\nreward (period 3), a pulling action to return the rake and reward\ntoward the monkey (period 4), and release of the rake and pickup\nof the food reward (period 5).\nThese periods are shown again inFigure 2, together with EMG\nactivity from eight different hand and arm muscles (M43), aver-\naged over 30 trials of raking from the right target and aligned to\nthe moment the rake was pulled across the right sensor (time 0).\nFor these 30 trials, the mean/H11006SD interval between HPR and the\nsensor signal was 710/H11006290 ms. Period 1 (“baseline”) lasted for\nthe 750 ms leading up to the release of the home pad by the\nexperimenter (HPR;Fig. 1C, Experimenter action). During this\nperiod, the monkey sat quietly with its left hand close to the rake\nthat lay on the table (Fig. 1B, dashed outline) and its right hand\non the block (Fig. 1B, B). Period 2 (“Rake pick-up”) began when\nthe experimenter released the home pad and uncovered the re-\nward. This period was defined as occupying the first half of the\ninterval between HPR and the sensor signal and lasted/H11011350 –500\nms. Period 3 (“Reach & swing”) was defined as taking up the\nsecond half of this interval. Period 4 (“Return, rake crosses sen-\nsor”) lasted from the moment the rake crossed the sensor to 250\nms later. Period 5 (“Food pick-up”), the last period, lasted from\n250 to 1000 ms after the rake crossed the sensor, during which\ntime the monkey released the rake and grasped the raked reward.\nThe duration of these periods were chosen on the basis of average\nvalues and were selected after detailed examination of the video\nand EMG records of the monkeys’ performance; there was con-\nsiderable trial-by-trial variation in the speed and direction of\nraking movements within a session (Fig. 1B). Monkeys generally\nraked fastest for rewards placed at the left sensor and slowest for\nthose at the right sensor (see below).\nEMG activity during the rake task\nFigure 2 shows rectified EMGs from different muscles, which\nhave been smoothed and averaged with reference to the sensor\nsignal. As expected, proximal arm muscles (biceps and anterior\ndeltoid) were active during the reaching and pulling phases of the\ntask, but it is clear that distal muscles (thenar, AbPL) were also\nactive during this complex task. There were marked bursts of\nactivity in all muscles, for example, in thenar and in the wrist\nextensor ECR-L when the monkey first picked up the rake (pe-\nriod 2) and extended its arm to place the rake beyond the target\n(period 3). Wrist flexor (FCR) and extensor (ECU) muscles were\nactive as the monkey withdrew the rake (period 4). There were\nadditional bursts of activity in AbPL, thenar, and EDC as the\nmonkey released the rake and picked up the food reward (period\n5) and a late burst in biceps as it brought the food reward to its\nmouth. These averages conceal considerable trial-by-trial varia-\ntion in EMG activity in this relatively unconstrained task; never-\ntheless, it is clear that the rake task is associated with a temporally\nfractionated pattern of activity in distal muscles, such as AbPL\nand thenar.\nActivity of M1 PTNs during the rake task\nA total of 69 PTNs were recorded within M1: 27 in monkey M43\n(16 recording sessions, PTNs E1–E27) and 42 in monkey M41 (18\nsessions; PTNs R28 –R69). PTNs were recorded for at least 120\ntrials (i.e., 40 for each target, presented in a pseudorandom or-\nder). Most of these PTNs were recorded in tracks made just an-\nterior to the central sulcus (Fig. 1D; Kraskov et al., 2011) at 17–19\nmm from the midline and at depths between 1 and 5.2 mm from\nthe surface: many of these PTNs would therefore have been lo-\ncated in the anterior bank of the sulcus. Antidromic latencies\nvaried from 0.6 to 6.0 ms (median, 1.2 ms). ICMS-evoked motor\nresponses were found at 100% (monkey M41) and 77% (M43) of\nM1 sites at which PTNs were recorded. These ICMS effects were\nobtained with intensities between 7 and 22\n/H9262A and were specific\nto the digits at 91 and 62% sites in M41 and M43, respectively.\nFigure 3A shows an example of M1 PTN (R58) activity during\nthe rake task. Again, all data have been aligned to the point at\nwhich the rake crossed the sensor (time 0). Spike rasters are\nshown for trials involving all three targets. For these trials, the\nmean interval between HPR and the monkey pulling the rake\nacross the sensor was 950/H11006130 ms, which was typical for mon-\nkey M41. This PTN had little or no resting discharge; it began to\nfire just after the home pad was released by the experimenter\n(blue circles superimposed on raster plots), which was the cue for\nthe monkey to pick up the rake. Discharge continued as the mon-\nkey reached the target (period 3) and pulled the rake back over\nthe sensor (period 4), after which it fell silent. There was a much\nsmaller burst of activity during food pickup (period 5).\nA second example is shown inFigure 3B (PTN R50). In this\ncase, there was a relatively high and stable discharge during the\nbaseline period of/H1101140 spikes/s. When the monkey grasped the\nrake, there was a striking decrease in activity, and PTN discharge\nwas completely absent until just before the rake was pulled over\nthe sensor (time 0). A burst of activity ensued as the monkey\nreleased the rake and picked up the food reward (period 5).\nTo summarize the activity in the population of 69 PTNs sam-\npled in this study, a two-way ANOVA, for task period and reward\nlocation, was performed.Post hoctests, with a Bonferroni’s cor-\nrection, revealed the periods (2–5) in which a PTN exhibited\nmodulation of its discharge when compared with baseline, and\nthis is shown inFigure 4A. PTN activity was either significantly\nincreased (yellow, p /H110210.05; light red,p /H110210.01; dark red,p /H11021\n0.001) or decreased (light blue,p /H110210.05; blue, p /H110210.01; dark\nblue, p /H110210.001) compared with baseline values; green indicates\nnonsignificant changes. Results for the 69 PTNs have been or-\ndered according to presence of facilitation in all three rake peri-\nods (top) through to suppression in all three periods (bottom),\nwith those PTNs showing no significant modulation in the mid-\ndle. The data are summarized inTable 1(top).\nCompared with baseline, most PTNs (64 of 69, 93%)\nshowed significant modulation in at least one of the three\nperiods involving use of the rake. In all, 68% PTNs showed\nsignificant modulation in the rake pickup period, 77% during\nreach and swing, and 68% during return. For the three periods\ntogether, between 29 and 39% of the PTNs sampled showed\nsignificant facilitation.\n17356 • J.

Effect of target position on raking activity.A shows an example of a PTN recorded in monkey M43 (E20) during the rake task that showed a clear variation according to the position from\nwhich the monkey raked its reward. Layout is the same as inFigure 3. The color code refers to the target sensor at which the food was placed: red and blue, respectively, for the sensor to the right\nand left of the monkey and green for the central sensor. Rasters (/H1101130 trials for each position) are referenced to the sensor signal (time 0). In the histograms below, the average firing rates are also\nplotted with the same color scheme. Note that there was a consistent position-dependent variation in the time between HPR and sensor signal (fastest for left target, slowest for right). The PTN in\nB (E26) showed very little variation in firing rate with food position (/H1101125 trials per position). Note that normalized EMG activity from deltoid and ECU exhibited clear position-related differences.\nQuallo, Kraskov et al.• Corticospinal Activity and Tool Use J. Neurosci., November 28, 2012 • 32(48):17351–17364 • 17357\nHowever, as Figure 4A and Table 1 (top) show, the overall\npattern of activity was rather heterogeneous. In particular, it was\nstriking that so many PTNs showed significantly suppressed ac-\ntivity during rake use (29 – 48%, depending on period); in many\ncases, these PTNs ceased to fire altogether (Fig. 3B). There were\nnine PTNs that showed suppression in all three rake periods and,\nof these, five were facilitated during food pickup, three were sup-\npressed, and one was not significant. During the initial “digits-in”\nperiod of the precision grip task, four of these PTNs showed\nincreased discharge.\nIn contrast to this pattern of suppression, the majority of\nPTNs (43 of 69; 62%) showed increased discharge during food\npickup at the end of the trial (Fig. 4A, last column). Of these 43\nPTNs, 32 were significantly modulated during rake pickup: 19\nshowed facilitation, and 13 showed suppression. There were nine\nPTNs that showed modulation during rake pickup but not dur-\ning food pickup.\nThe period in which PTNs showed their highest increase in\nfiring rate relative to baseline (maximum MPI; see Materials and\nMethods) is given inTable 1(bottom). Although 20% of PTNs\nhad their MPI during rake pickup, 51% showed this during food\npickup. Many PTNs (42%) showed maximum suppression\n(MPS) during the reach period.\nEffect of reward position on PTN activity\nIn an attempt to distinguish PTNs whose activity was better re-\nlated to the distal hand movements involved in grasping and\nholding the rake from those PTNs with activity associated with\nextending the rake to reach and retrieve rewards, we examined\nthe activity of PTNs when the food reward was placed at different\npositions on the rake table (Fig. 1B). Each position was equipped\nwith a sensor.Figure 5A shows an example of a PTN (E20) that\nshowed some position-dependent activity. Rasters and averages\nare again aligned to the point at which the rake crossed the sensor.\nIn this session, the mean interval between HPR and the sensor\nsignal was shortest (590/H11006150 ms) for raking from the left target\n(blue), longest (870/H11006150 ms) for the right target (red), and\nintermediate (750/H11006130 ms) for the central (green) target. The\nPTN shown was mainly active as the monkey pulled the rake and\nreward back from the sensor (Fig. 1C, period 4). There was\ngreater discharge for raking from the right-hand sensor (red) and\nleast for the left (blue), with intermediate activity for the center\ntarget (green). Differences in EMG activity for raking from the\nthree targets were particularly striking in muscles acting at the\nwrist (ECU) and shoulder (deltoid) but less so in thenar muscles.\nOverall, 36 PTNs (52%) showed a main effect of food position\n(two-way ANOVA with five task periods and three positions as\nmain factors,p /H110210.05). The remaining PTNs showed little or no\nposition dependence. The example shown inFigure 5B was par-\nticularly active for the rake pickup, but the depth of modulation\nin its discharge was not significantly affected by the sensor on\nwhich the food was placed (p /H110050.64). Another such example is\nshown inFigure 3A (R58).\nFigure 6. Confirmation that the same PTN was recorded during both rake and precision grip tasks. Spike discrimination (A, D), interspike interval (B, E), and antidromic responses (C, F) from a\nPTN are shown. The amplitude and shape of the spike was constant during both the rake task (A) and precision grip task (D); average/H11006SEM of spike shape for 1011 spikes are shown. The interspike\nintervals of these 1011 spikes from the PTN (B, E) confirmed the quality of the clustering by demonstrating the almost total absence of any unphysiologically short intervals (/H110212 ms). The PTN fired\nat higher frequencies during the rake versus precision grip tasks. The PTN responded antidromically at short latency (0.9 ms) after the pyramidal tract stimulus (artifact to left of records inC and F;\naverages of responses to 78 and 79 stimuli, respectively). Antidromic responses were identical before the rake task (C) and before the precision grip task (F).\n17358 • J.

All 69 PTNs were therefore\nrecorded during a precision grip task\n(Baker et al., 2001). This task requires\nfractionated movements of the digits and\nindependent positioning of spring-loaded\nlevers by the index finger and thumb.\nTo ensure that the same neuron was\nrecorded for both tasks, we carefully re-\nchecked the antidromic identification of\neach PTN before and after performance\nof the two tasks.Figure 6 illustrates the\nspike discrimination of a PTN during\nthe rake and then during the precision\ngrip task. The shape and amplitude of\nthe PTN spike remained unchanged\nacross tasks. Note the difference in the\ndistribution of interspike intervals across\nthe tasks for this PTN, with higher frequen-\ncies during the rake task (Fig. 6B) than dur-\ning the precision grip task (Fig. 6E).Figure 6,\nC and F, shows the antidromic responses\nfrom the PTN (0.9 ms antidromic latency)\nthat were identical when tested before the\nrake task (Fig. 6C) and after precision grip\n(Fig. 6F).\nFigure 7 shows the activity of the\nsame PTN (R48) for the rake task (A)\nand precision grip task (B). This PTN\nwas particularly active for the rake\npickup and showed a peak firing rate\nduring this period of/H1101150 spikes/s. Dur-\ning the precision grip task, this PTN was\nstrongly modulated as the monkey in-\nserted its digits into the manipulandum\nand moved the levers into the target po-\nsition, with a peak rate of/H1101170 spikes/s.\nFigure 7 also presents averaged EMG\ndata from the same set of muscles for the\ntwo tasks; muscles acting on the digits\n(AbPL, thenar, and FDP) and wrist\n(ECR-L) were active during both tasks.\nPTN activity during precision grip\nWe calculated the proportion of PTNs ac-\ntive for three different precision grip task\nperiods: period 1 digits-in was for the 250\nms up to the first detectable movement of\nthe manipulandum levers and reflected\nthe dynamic phase during which the\nmonkey brought its thumb and index fin-\nger into position to displace the two le-\nvers. Period 2 was the “hold” period,\nwhich lasted for 1 s after the monkey be-\ngan to hold the levers within the set dis-\nplacement limits (5–9 mm from the\nstart position). This “hold-start” signal\nwas defined as the moment when both\nlevers were stabilized (close to zero lever\nvelocity) within the target window. Pe-\nriod 3 “digits-out” lasted for the 500 ms\nafter the end of the hold period (i.e.,\n1000 –1500 ms after the hold start). Values were calculated\nrelative to the baseline firing rate during the rake task (there\nwas no equivalent baseline period in the precision grip task).\nFigure 7. Comparison of PTN activity during rake and precision grip tasks.A shows the activity of a PTN (R48) during the rake\ntask (85 trials).B shows the activity for this same PTN during the precision grip task (126 trials). For the rake task, the rasters are\naligned to the sensor signal, and the gray scale bar shows the approximate duration of the different periods of the task (seeFigs. 1,\n2). For the precision grip task, they are aligned with the onset of displacement of the levers by the index finger and thumb, after\nthey had been inserted into the manipulandum (Digits In). The monkey displaced the levers into a target zone and held them there\nfor /H110111 s (Hold), after which the monkey removed its digits (D. Out). Averaged, smoothed, and rectified EMGs from AbPL, thenar,\nFDP, and ECR-L muscles recorded during both tasks are shown.

Neurosci., November 28, 2012 • 32(48):17351–17364 • 17359\nMost PTNs (67 of 69, 97%) showed significant modulation in\nat least one of the three precision grip periods. In all, 58 PTNs\n(84%) showed significant modulation during the digits-in pe-\nriod, 53 (77%) during hold, and 57 (83%) during digits-out. The\nmajority (67%) of PTNs recorded during the precision grip task\nshowed their maximum MPI during the digits-in period. Fewer\nPTNs (23%) had their maximum MPI in the digits-out period\nand even fewer (10%) in the hold period. The period that con-\ntained the lowest firing rate relative to baseline (MPS) was more\nevenly distributed with 36, 36, and 28% of cells in the digits-in,\nhold, and digits-out periods, respectively.\nComparison of PTN activity in rake versus precision grip tasks\nOf the 69 PTNs tested, 62 (90%) showed significant modulation\nfor both tasks. We decided to focus on the comparison between\nthe rake pickup (period 2;Figs. 1, 2) and the digits-in period of\nthe precision grip task. We compared the data in the leftmost\ncolumn inFigure 4A (rake pickup) with that inFigure 4B (digits-\nin). The data have been plotted using the same color code, and\nPTNs are shown in the same order inFigure 4, A and B. PTNs\nshowing significant facilitation in all three periods of rake use are\nat the top and those with suppression in all three periods at the\nbottom, with other patterns of change in between and those with\nnonsignificant changes in the middle. It is clear that this ordered\narrangement inFigure 4A is completely lost inFigure 4B. Thus,\nalthough PTNs were modulated during both tasks, their pattern\nof activation was often different.\nThis point is summarized inTable 2: of the 27 PTNs whose dis-\ncharge was facilitated during rake pickup, only 16 (59%) showed\nincreased discharge during precision grip, and seven (26%) showed\nsuppression. Likewise, of the 20 PTNs showing suppression during\nthe rake task, equal numbers (8/H1100540%) were facilitated or sup-\npressed during precision grip. Of the nine PTNs that were sup-\npressed in all three rake periods, four showed facilitation in precision\ngrip. Analysis of the 43 PTNs that were activated during food pickup\nafter raking (Fig. 4A) showed that a similar proportion of these PTNs\nwere facilitated (56%) or suppressed (23%) during the digits-in pe-\nriod of the precision grip task (Fig. 4B).\nWe also calculated the periods in which PTNs exhibited their\nmaximum percentage increase (MPI) or suppression (MPS):\nPTNs showed a similar depth of modulation for the two tasks.\nPTN–muscle relationships during rake versus precision\ngrip tasks\nTo investigate the correlation between PTN activity and muscle\nactivity during the two different tasks, we computed, for each\ntask, the CCF (Holdefer and Miller, 2002; Jackson et al., 2007) for\neach PTN with each of 12 muscles from which EMG was simul-\ntaneously recorded. The CCF was computed for 65 of 69 PTNs\nfor which /H110222000 spikes were available (range of 2376 –31,845\nspikes). In the rake task, most PTNs (50 of 65, 77%) showed a\nclear CCF peak (r /H110220.1; Fig. 8, blue curves).Figure 8A presents\nexamples of the CCF analysis for three PTNs with muscles AbPL,\nthenar, and ECR-L in M41. In one case (R45;Fig. 8A, left), the\ncorrelograms all showed a single broad peak, centered on time 0\n(spike discharge), and these were common to all three muscles\n(“single peak” category ofMcKiernan et al., 2000). The CCF for\nthis PTN with the same muscles during the precision grip task\n(black curves) was rather similar, although the positive peaks\nwere larger and broader. To compare the correlation between\ndischarge in a given PTN and EMG activity across the two tasks,\nwe calculated the correlation between the CCF values for rake\nversus precision grip: we refer to this metric as the “correlation\nbetween correlations,” or rr. For PTN R45, there was a significant\npositive correlation of CCFs across tasks for all of the three mus-\ncles shown; rr had values of 0.86, 0.68, and 0.84, respectively,\nindicating a rather similar PTN–EMG relationship across tasks.\nIn contrast, for R41 (Fig. 8A, middle), there was a more complex\nCCF for the rake task (“double peak” category ofMcKiernan et al.,\n2000) and a strikingly different CCF for precision grip (biphasic).\nThere was a significant negative correlation between the CCFs for all\nthree muscles (rr/H11005/H110020.52 to/H110020.68). The final example (R32;Fig.\n8A, right) again showed CCF effects that were clearly different be-\ntween the two tasks.Figure 8B summarizes the comparison of each\nPTN–muscle relationship (CCF) between the two tasks. In most\ncases, the measure rr was positive (R45) but a considerable number\nof PTNs showed negative values (R41). Thus, although the great\nmajority of PTNs showed significant modulation of discharge dur-\ning both rake and precision grip tasks, they could show a range of\ndifferent relationships with the muscles used to perform these tasks.\nSome PTNs active during the rake task are CM cells\nWe investigated whether PTNs that showed modulation in their\ndischarge during the rake task could also be identified as CM cells,\nbecause this would provide direct evidence of the involvement of\nthe CM system in tool use. A total of 65 PTNs were tested for\nwhich STAs with/H110222000 spikes were available. Of these 65 PTNs,\n17 (26%) were identified as CM cells by the presence of clear\npostspike facilitation (PSF) in the STA. A total of 35 PSF effects\nwere found from these 17 cells, and, of these, 25 (71%) were in\nmuscles acting on the digits.\nFour STAs from two PTNs are shown inFigure 9. Spikes from\nPTN R48 produced a clear PSF in both thenar and FDP EMG\n(Fig. 9A). The PSF was present in averages compiled from data\nrecorded during both the rake task (12,168 spikes; blue) and the\nprecision grip (7225 spikes; black). The activity of this PTN is\nshown in Figure 7. PTN R50 (Fig. 9B) showed a PSF in EMGs\nfrom ECR-L and AbPL; these were relatively larger in STAs from\nthe rake task versus precision grip. Interestingly, this PTN (rasters\nshown inFig. 3B) was one of those that showed suppressed activ-\nity during rake pickup; its discharge pattern followed closely the\nactivity of the AbPL target muscle.\nAll but one of the 17 identified CM cells were significantly mod-\nulated during at least one period of the rake task (Fig. 4A); three\nshowed facilitation of discharge during rake pickup, and seven were\nsuppressed during this period. PSF effects produced by these CM\ncells were stable across tasks: of the 35 effects, 26 were clearly present\nin averages compiled from data recorded in both rake and precision\ngrip tasks (compare withFig. 9). Six PSFs were detectable only in the\nrake data and three only in the precision grip data. As might be\nexpected, most CM cells had generally positive correlations with\ntheir target muscles, as revealed by CCF analysis: this was the case for\n21 of 26 digit muscles showing PSF (McKiernan et al., 2000). In some\ncases, the CCF effects were complex (see R41 inFig. 8A, which is a\nCM cell), and CM cells, just as other PTNs, could show different\nrelationships with their target muscles across tasks.\nTable 2.

Neurosci., November 28, 2012• 32(48):17351–17364 Quallo, Kraskov et al. • Corticospinal Activity and Tool Use\nDiscussion\nThe rake task has been the subject of a number of previous studies\nof tool use by captive Japanese macaques (Iriki et al., 1996) and\nRhesus macaques (Warden et al., 1940; Shurcliff et al., 1971). We\nhave demonstrated that 90% of PTNs recorded in the hand area\nof macaque M1 showed significant modulation of their discharge\nduring the use of this simple tool. Interestingly, almost all of the\nPTNs modulated their activity for both the rake task and for\nprecision grip, confirming that PTNs whose discharge is associ-\nated with independent movement of the digits are also recruited\nduring use of a tool. A significant proportion of these PTNs were\nidentified as CM cells influencing digit muscles and therefore\nshows for the first time that the CM system is involved in tool use.\nEMG activity during rake and precision grip tasks\nThe precision grip task requires independent control of the index\nfinger and thumb and has been used in many previous studies for\nidentifying CM effects in the macaque (Bennett and Lemon, 1996;\nLemon, 2008). The rake task is less constrained (for trial-by-trial\nvariability, seeFig. 1B), and although it involves reaching and pulling\nactions that engage the proximal segments of the upper limb, digit\nand wrist control is necessary for fine manipulation of rake position\nand orientation of the rake within the hand to successfully retrieve\nthe food. The interaction between proximal and distal muscular syn-\nergies is also characteristic of tool use in humans (Santello et al.,\n1998). Figure 2shows that, in addition to EMG activity in proximal\nmuscles such as deltoid and biceps, distal muscles (thenar, AbPL,\nEDC) were active. We have demonstrated that performance on the\nrake task is characterized by a fractionated pattern of activity in distal\nmuscles (Figs. 2, 3, 7A) that is presumably required to position the\ndifferent digits around the shaft of the rake.\nActivity of PTNs and CM cells during rake and precision\ngrip tasks\nThe great majority of the PTNs sampled here had short anti-\ndromic latencies (fast-conducting axons;Fig. 6), were located in\nthe anterior bank of the central sulcus, and were found at sites that\nyielded digit movements at low intensities of ICMS. In addition, a\nconsiderable proportion (26%) of these PTNs was identified as CM\ncells (Fig. 9). These are all distinctive anatomical and physiological\nproperties of the corticospinal projection to the contralateral hand\n(Buys et al., 1986; Lemon et al., 1986; Rathelot and Strick, 2006,\n2009). The CM cells reported had most of their postspike effects in\ndigit muscles (cf.Buys et al., 1986; McKiernan et al., 1998).\nThe first point to make about this sample of PTNs is that they\nnearly all showed well-modulated activity during the rake task\n(Fig. 4A). It is important to point out that they were not prese-\nlected for task-related activity but for their responses as PTNs.\nNonetheless, 93% showed significant modulation during at least\none of the three main periods of the task: rake pickup, reach and\nswing, and rake return (periods 2– 4;Fig. 4A). Forty-five percent\nof PTNs showed significant modulation during all of these peri-\nods. It is clear fromFigure 4A that different PTNs exhibited a\nrather heterogeneous pattern of activity across the different task\nFigure 8. PTN muscle activity during rake and precision grip tasks.A, CCFs for spikes from three PTNs (R45, R41, and R32) with rectified EMGs recorded from AbPL, thenar, and ECR-L muscles. The correlation\ncoefficientris plotted against time relative to PTN discharge (time 0) with a resolution of 10 ms bins. Correlations are plotted for both the rake task (blue) and precision grip task (black). The CCFs for PTN R45 during\nthe two tasks were positively correlated (all rr/H110220.6,p/H110210.05) in all three muscles. PTN R41 showed contrasting patterns of CCF for rake and precision grip, and the CCFs were negatively correlated (all rr/H11021/H110020.5,\np/H110210.05), whereas mixed effects were present for PTN R32. Numbers of spikes contributing to each CCF: R45, rake 15,011 and precision grip, 10,186; R41, rake 20,595 and precision grip 7274; R32, rake 5383 and\nprecision grip 5255.B, The distribution of correlation coefficients (rr) between the rake and precision grip CCFs for all PTNs in which at least one of the CCFs was/H110220.1 are shown (n is the number of PTN–muscle\npairs tested).\nQuallo, Kraskov et al.• Corticospinal Activity and Tool Use J. Neurosci., November 28, 2012 • 32(48):17351–17364 • 17361\nperiods, with some PTNs showing signif-\nicant facilitation and suppression during\ndifferent phases of rake use. However, the\nunconstrained nature of the task made it\ndifficult to attribute changes in neuronal\nactivity to any particular task component.\nThe second point is that careful com-\nparison of PTN activity for the rake task\nversus the precision grip task showed that\nmost PTNs (90%) that modulated their\nactivity during the rake task were also\nmodulated during precision grip (Figs. 6,\n7A) and that they showed a similar depth\nof modulation across the two tasks. This\nmakes it likely that many of the hand area\nM1 PTNs that were active during the rake\ntask were associated with movements\nmade by the monkey’s hand and digits\nduring pickup and manipulation of the\nrake.\nThe third point is that, although PTNs\nwere recruited in both tasks, they can\nshow very different patterns of activity\nand different relationships with the mus-\ncles involved. This is evident from the\ncomparison of Figure 4, A and B, and\nfrom the CCF data shown inFigure 8.\nThus, although it might seem obvious that\nCM cells and other PTNs that are active\nfor precision grip will also be active for the\nrake task because both are characterized\nby a degree of independent digit move-\nment, the findings here confirm that the\nrecruitment of CM cells can be highly task\nspecific (Muir and Lemon, 1983; Bennett\nand Lemon, 1996; Umilta et al., 2007).We\nshowed that/H1101136% of the PTNs sampled\nshowed different levels of activity for the\ndirection of raking (Fig. 5A), which is ex-\npected because of directional tuning\nproperties of M1 neurons (Georgopoulos\net al., 1982), and might reflect PTNs pri-\nmarily concerned with proximal arm\nmuscles determining the direction of the\nreach. However, given the location of the recorded PTNs at sites\nat which ICMS yielded digit movements and the demonstration\nthat most of the postspike effects were in digit muscles (see\nabove), it is noteworthy that 64% of the PTNs showed no detect-\nable position-related change [Figs. 3A (R58), 5B (E26)]. This\nmight be consistent with a class of PTNs more concerned with the\ndistal manipulation of the rake in the hand rather than the direc-\ntion of reach of the raking arm.\nWhy do some PTNs show suppression of activity during the\nrake task?\nIt was relatively common to find PTNs with a steady baseline firing\nrate that showed strong suppression of their discharge when the\nmonkey used the rake (Figs. 3B, 4A). Interestingly, the majority of\nthese PTNs showed significantly increased discharge when the mon-\nkey picked up the food reward at the end of the trial (Fig. 3B). Of the\n17 CM cells identified, seven showed suppression during the rake\ntask (Fig. 4A), whereas only one was suppressed during precision\ngrip (Fig. 4B). The seemingly paradoxical decrease in firing rate of\nPTNs, especially of CM cells, is in keeping with the negative cor-\nrelation between the firing rate of some M1 neurons and grip\nforce (Smith et al., 1975) and with suppressed activity of the\nprimary somatosensory cortex and posterior parietal neurons\nduring grasp and manipulation (Ro et al., 2000). This may reflect\ninhibition of CM cells with muscle fields that are inappropriate\nfor the particular task (Maier et al., 1993). It is also possible that a\nsubset of CM cells might control activity in a given muscle by\ncontrolled disfacilitation, whereas another (positively correlated)\nsubset exert control by increasing discharge rate and facilitation\nof target muscles. Disfacilitation might be a particularly impor-\ntant mechanism for controlling intrinsic hand muscles, because a\nrecent study suggested that motoneurons of these muscles may\nreceive relatively few inhibitory inputs from local interneuronal\nnetworks (Takei and Seki, 2010).\nWhat does M1 contribute to the rake task?\nOur results show well-modulated activity in M1 PTNs for the\nrake task. Because these changes of activity overlapped heavily\nFigure 9. Evidence that PTNs active during rake task were cm cells.A, STAs showing that PTN R48 (seeFig. 7A) produced PSF of\nEMG from both thenar and FDP muscles. These effects were observed in STAs compiled for activity during both the rake task (blue\nlines) and during precision grip (black). PTN discharge is at time 0. Numbers of spikes used to compile STAs given in parentheses.\nSTAs have been autoscaled to the peak value of the PSF of two tasks.B, PSF in averages of EMG from ECR-L and AbPL muscles\nproduced by PTN R50 (seeFig. 3B). Again, PSF was detected in both rake and precision grip data.\n17362 • J. Neurosci., November 28, 2012• 32(48):17351–17364 Quallo, Kraskov et al. • Corticospinal Activity and Tool Use\nwith those during food grasp and precision grip (Fig. 4), the\nfindings argue for some executive circuits that are common to use\nof the hand and of a tool (Jacobs et al., 2010). However, the results\nalso suggest that there may be features of PTN activity that are\ncharacteristic of tool use, because many PTNs showed quite dif-\nferent relationships to muscle activity during rake use compared\nwith food pickup or precision grip.\nIn an imaging study,Obayashi et al. (2002)found activity specific\nto the rake task in the contralateral M1 but found larger changes in\nthe premotor cortex, intraparietal sulcus (IPS), pre-supplementary\nmotor area, and cerebellum. The rake task can be learned by naive\nmacaque monkeys in/H110212 weeks (Ishibashi et al., 2000; Quallo et al.,\n2009), possibly reflecting its natural and unconstrained character.\nQuallo et al. (2009)found structural changes in the cortical gray\nmatter of monkeys learning the rake task, but these changes were in\nthe IPS, superior temporal sulcus, and somatosensory cortex area 2\nbut not in motor cortex. Thus, it would appear that M1 is not spe-\ncifically involved in the learning and planning of the rake task. How-\never, it is likely that the motor cortex still provides the essential\nexecutive pathways controlling the complex interactions between\ndigits, hand, and arm that are required for tool use. These pathways\nmust be easily accessed by brain areas more concerned with the\ncognitive aspects of tool use. These might include projections from\nventral premotor cortex, which can be preferentially involved in tool\nuse (Umilta et al., 2008), and indirect projections from areas in the\nIPS that have been shown to be involved in tool use (Peeters et al.,\n2009) and in which neurons have been shown to change their prop-\nerties when monkeys use a tool (Iriki et al., 1996).\nThe corticospinal system, dexterity, and tool use\nTool use has been described in a wide variety of different species,\nincluding cephalopods (Finn et al., 2009), birds (Hunt et al., 2001),\nrodents (Okanoya et al., 2008) and primates (van Schaik et al., 1999).\nIt is therefore unlikely that this behavior is mediated by the same\ncentral nervous structures in these very different animals. However,\nit is the primates that exhibit the widest range of behaviors involving\ntools (van Schaik et al., 1999). The corticospinal system is developed\nto a rather variable extent in different species of nonhuman pri-\nmates, and there is a correlation between the development of this\nsystem and dexterity (Lemon and Griffiths, 2005; Lemon, 2008). For\nexample, tree shrews and marmosets have a low index of dexterity\nand lack CM connections. There are no reports of these species using\ntools in the wild; captive marmosets can be trained to use the rake,\nbut this requires a much higher number of trials than in macaques\n(Yamazaki et al., 2011).\nThe corticospinal innervation of hand muscles in the New\nWorld capuchin monkey (Cebus appella) is well developed, and\nCebus monkeys use fine finger movements to use tools (Anti-\nnucci and Visalberghi, 1986; Costello and Fragaszy, 1988; Chris-\ntel and Fragaszy, 2000). In contrast, the New World squirrel\nmonkey (Saimiri sciureus) has a poorly developed CM system\n(Bortoff and Strick, 1993; Nakajima et al., 2000) and it does not\nuse the precision grip (Costello and Fragaszy, 1988), and there are\nto date no reports of tool use by this species.\nThe CM system is best developed in great apes (Leyton and Sher-\nrington, 1917; Phillips, 1971; Kuypers, 1981) and humans (Lemon,\n1993, 2008; Nakajima et al., 2000). However, there has so far been no\ndirect evidence for the involvement of the corticospinal system and its\nCM component in tool use. The CM system is a putative candidate\nproviding the capacity to grasp a tool and to manipulate it using an\nextensive repertoire of digit actions, for which relative independence of\nthumb and digit movement is a prerequisite (Porter and Lemon, 1993;\nSchieber and Santello, 2004). CM neurons in M1 are accessible to inputs\nfrom parietofrontal circuits that probably subserve important cognitive\naspects of tool use (see above,Johnson-Frey, 2004; Iriki, 2006; Jacobs et\nal., 2010) and particularly to inputs from ventral premotor cortex\n(Shimazu et al., 2004; Davare et al., 2011; Kraskov et al., 2011), which\nmay help to transform visual representations of targets for tool action\ninto appropriate commands for grasping and using the tool (Umilta et\nal., 2007, 2008; Davare et al., 2008). The present investigation provides\nthe first direct evidence for the involvement of the CM system in primate\ntool use and provides a description of the activity patterns involved.\nDescending systems other than the CM projection may sup-\nport the capacity for skilled grasp (Porter and Lemon, 1993). For\nexample, corticospinal collaterals are known to activate C3–C4\npropriospinal neurons projecting to hand motoneurons (Isa et\nal., 2006; Kinoshita et al., 2012). Selective inactivation of this\nsystem using “genetic dissection” showed that, in some monkeys,\nthere was a transient impairment of precision grip, indicating a\nrole for the C3–C4 system. However, little is known about the\nnatural activity of these propriospinal neurons and whether this\nactivity is appropriate for the support of skilled tasks, such as rake\nuse. In the future, it will be interesting to compare such activity\npatterns with those reported here for the CM system.\nReferences\nAntinucci F, Visalberghi E (1986) Tool use inCebus apella: a case study.
