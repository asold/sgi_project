  "full_text": "A novel method for drug‑target interaction \nprediction based on graph transformers model\nHongmei Wang1, Fang Guo1, Mengyan Du1, Guishen Wang1* and Chen Cao2,3* \nBackground\nIt is well known that there are tens of thousands of diseases that threaten human health. \nDrug discovery is an important research area that urgently needs to be explored . At \nthe same time, the rapid development of computer technology has sparked a wave of \ninterdisciplinary collaboration. In particular, with the aid of machine learning and deep \nlearning, bioinformatics can effectively improve the efficiency of drug discovery. Drug-\ntarget interactions (DTIs) prediction aims to identify the targets of drug molecules, \nwhich plays a crucial role in the drug discovery process and has become a hot topic in \ncomputer-aided drug discovery [1]. Compared with traditional drug discovery models, \nDTIs prediction can effectively reduce the cost of drug discovery [2].\nTraditional methods of DTIs prediction are mostly based on machine learning. \nRecent works, such as the fuzzy bipartite local model [3 ], multi-output prediction \nmethod [4], and superior Bayesian personalized ranking method [5 ] are representative \nAbstract \nBackground: Drug-target interactions (DTIs) prediction becomes more and more \nimportant for accelerating drug research and drug repositioning. Drug-target interac-\ntion network is a typical model for DTIs prediction. As many different types of relation-\nships exist between drug and target, drug-target interaction network can be used for \nmodeling drug-target interaction relationship. Recent works on drug-target interaction \nnetwork are mostly concentrate on drug node or target node and neglecting the rela-\ntionships between drug-target.\nResults: We propose a novel prediction method for modeling the relationship \nbetween drug and target independently. Firstly, we use different level relationships \nof drugs and targets to construct feature of drug-target interaction. Then, we use line \ngraph to model drug-target interaction. After that, we introduce graph transformer \nnetwork to predict drug-target interaction.\nConclusions: This method introduces a line graph to model the relationship between \ndrug and target. After transforming drug-target interactions from links to nodes, a \ngraph transformer network is used to accomplish the task of predicting drug-target \ninteractions.\nKeywords: Drug-target interaction, Graph attention network, Line graph\nOpen Access\n© The Author(s) 2022.

BMC Bioinformatics          (2022) 23:459 \nmethods. Ding et al. [3 ] developed a fuzzy bipartite local model based on a fuzzy least \nsquares support vector machine and multicore learning to predict DTIs. They first \napplied multicore learning to fuse multiple drugs and targets, and finally used fuzzy \nbipartite local models to infer unknown DTIs. Pliakos et al. [4 ] proposed DTIs predic -\ntion as a multi-output prediction problem and solved it by learning an ensemble of \nmulti-output biclustering trees on a reconfigured network. Ye et al. [5 ] proposed an \nAdversarial Bayesian Personalized Ranking model that first generated ternary biased-\norder relations for drug targets, then used the biased-order relations to train a drug \nand target latent factor matrix, and finally obtained the score ranking for DTIs pre -\ndiction from the inner product of latent factors.\nWith the rapid development of deep learning methods, DTIs methods have been \nproposed as a deep learning approach for target prediction and drug repurposing in \nheterogeneous drug-gene-disease networks, which greatly facilitates target identifica -\ntion and advances the process of drug repurposing. Sun et al. [6 ] proposed an auto-\nencoder-based DTI prediction method that projects drug features to the protein space \nvia a multi-layer encoder and then to the disease space via a decoder. Xuan et al. [7 ] \nproposed methods to integrate multi-scale adjacent topologies, multiple similarities, \nassociations, and drug- and protein-related interactions, which used a fully connected \nself-encoder learning framework to learn low-dimensional feature representations of \nnodes in heterogeneous networks, and then applied a multilayer convolutional neu -\nral network to generate the final predictions. Howevertraditional methods are fre -\nquently used for small samples, and extracting complex graph structure information \nis difficult.\nSince DTIs networks can be modeled as networks, many network based methods \nhave emerged at this stage to predict DTIs. Manoochehri et al. [8 ] proposed a net -\nwork topology-based framework for predicting interacting and non-interacting drug-\ntarget pairs that is capable of learning complex drug-target topological features. Jin \net al. [9 ] proposed the multi-resolutional collaborative heterogeneous graph convolu -\ntional Auto-Encoder method for DTIs prediction, which fused and assigned weights \nto embeddings of various types of links and continuously added adjacent embeddings \nby gated recurrent units before fusing them together to form the final embedding. \nYue et al. [10] proposed a method for bipartite DTI relations based on heterogeneous \nnetwork embedding that decomposed a heterogeneous DTI network into three sub-\nnetworks. A random forest model was used to predict new DTIs by combining the \nfeatures of a bipartite DTI network for drug-target interactions, a drug-based simi -\nlarity network, and a target-based similarity network. However, current deep learn -\ning methods are simpler for drug-protein interactions and cannot extract deep-level \ninteraction information.\nThe existing DTI prediction methods are excellent, but there are still some problems. \nResearchers normally solely consider drug-protein interactions and overlook drug-pro -\ntein interactions between two drug-protein pairs. In addition, the relationship between \nnodes and the whole heterogeneous graph is often neglected. In this paper, we introduce \na line graph with drug-protein pairs as vertices and propose a drug-target interaction \nprediction method based on a graph transformer network (DTI-GTN). The main contri-\nbutions of our method are as follows.\nPage 3 of 17\nWang et al. BMC Bioinformatics          (2022) 23:459 \n \n• Current approaches for DTIs prediction are limited to simple drug-protein interac -\ntions. To address this problem, we constructed a drug-protein pair interaction line \ngraph with the drug-protein interactions as vertices, which allows us to extract more \ninformation about drug-protein pair interactions.\n• Traditional models place more emphasis on the node’s neighbor relationship and less \nemphasis on the node’s relationship to the whole heterogeneous graph. To solve this \nproblem, we employ the GTN model to determine the relationship between each \ninteraction node and the entire heterogeneous graph.\n• Our method contributes to increasing the efficiency of DTIs prediction. The experi -\nmental results on the Peng et al. [11] dataset show that our method performs well on \nboth AUROC and AUPR metrics.\nThe full paper is divided into five parts, which are organized as follows. In background, \nwe introduce the background of the study and presents the main research contents and \ncontributions of this paper in view of some current problems of drug-target interaction \nprediction and the current status of domestic and international research. There are the \nrelated works in the field of drug target prediction and the shortcomings of the current \nwork in Related Works. In methods, we propose a drug-target prediction method based \non the GTN model, which transforms the drug-target map into a drug-protein pair line \ngraph and predicts and evaluates it by the GTN model. In addition we describe in detail \neach module of our method. In experiment, we present the data set used in this paper, \nthe validation metrics and the final results of multiple experiments. After extensive \nreview, it is found that the drug-protein pairs with the highest prediction scores have \npractical significance, thus confirming the effectiveness of this method. In conclusion, \nwe summarize the entire work and point out the limitations of this study and the outlook \nfor future work.\nRelated works\nDrug-target interactions (DTIs) prediction plays an important role in finding potential \ntherapeutic compounds. Moreover, DTIs prediction is an indispensable step in drug \nre-positioning [12] and drug discovery [13]. DTIs prediction is also helpful to identify \nnew ligands for new drugs and targets by identifying the interactions between drug \ncompounds and protein targets. DTIs prediction methods can be roughly divided into \ntraditional methods and deep learning methods. Among a large number of deep learn -\ning methods, network-based methods perform well in predicting DTIs. Therefore, the \nfollowing focuses on the traditional methods and the network-based methods in deep \nlearning.\nTraditional DTIs prediction methods\nTraditional DTIs prediction methods are mainly divided into two categories: (1) meth -\nods based on molecular docking simulation [14]. (2) Ligand-based approaches [15]. \nBased on basic biophysical principles and the crystal structure of the target binding site, \nmolecular docking methods often yield good prediction of druggability. In contrast to \nconventional ligand-protein docking, reverse ligand-protein docking aims to seek poten-\ntial protein targets by screening an appropriate protein database [16]. Ligand-based \nPage 4 of 17Wang et al. BMC Bioinformatics          (2022) 23:459 \napproaches are often designed based on the principle of structure-dependent properties. \nThese methods use structural similarity to search similar compounds in terms of activi -\nties or treatment mechanisms. Although the above-mentioned methods have shown \nhigh prediction accuracy. Those molecular docking methods rely on the three-dimen -\nsional structure of the target protein [17]. The results of ligand-based methods may be \nless than ideal when there are insufficient data on known ligands [18]. However, most \ncurrent network-based approaches ignore the information relationship between the \nnodes and the whole heterogeneous graph.\nNetwork based methods\nIn recent years, many network-based methods have been proposed to predict potential \nDTIs because DTIs networks can be modeled as networks. There are some advantages \nof these methods that do a better use of Network Structure Information [19]. Manoo -\nchehri et al. [8] proposed a semi-supervised bipartite graph model. The model integrated \ndrug-drug and protein-protein relationships into a bipartite graph. Jin et al. [9] proposed \na multi-resolution collaborative heterogeneous graph convolution autoencoder for \nDTIs prediction that collaboratively aggregated the learned embeddings from different \ntypes of links in heterogeneous drugtarget networks, thus leading to more interpreta -\nble embeddings for each drug and target node. Tang et al. [20] proposed a heterogene -\nous network edge denoising model based on association exponential kernel matrix and \npotential global association. This method transformed the DTIs prediction problem into \na noise reduction problem on heterogeneous networks. The heterogeneous network \nwas constructed by combining drug and target kernel matrices and the existing DTIs \nnetwork. Furthermore, the method not only used the information of associations of the \nnearest neighbors to perform DTIs prediction, but also incorporated the global asso -\nciation between drugs and targets to reduce the sparsity of DTIs network and improve \nprediction accuracy. Yue et al. [10] proposed a heterogeneous network embedding DTIs \nmodel, which can extract distinct features from every sub-network of the heterogeneous \nDTIs network and concatenate these features by the topological information between \nthe sub-networks. This method makes better use of the characteristics of DTIs relation -\nships between both sides and assists similar information and targets related to drugs.\nIn recent years, graph neural networks have become another hot topic of graph min -\ning. Due to the rapid development of graph machine learning, different graph neural \nnetworks have benn proposed [21]. Among them, heterogeneous graph neural network \n(HGN) [22], hraph attention networks (GAT) [23], Topology adaptive graph convolu -\ntional networks (TAG) [24], and residual gated graph convnets (RGG) [25] are repre -\nsentative models [25]. Graphs provide a universal way to represent data, and many other \ntypes of data can also be transformed into graphs. Drug side effect prediction and DTIs \nidentification are essentially edge prediction problems. Cheng et  al. [26] proposed an \nend-to-end deep learning approach based on a graph attention network and multiple \nself-attention mechanisms to predict DTIs. The feature extraction of drugs and pro -\nteins is improved by using graph attention network and a multi-head self-attention \nmechanism. However, they only use one-dimensional data to represent the structural \ncharacteristic information of drugs and proteins, and much advanced characteristic \ninformation of drugs and proteins is lost in prediction. Peng et  al. [11] improved the \nPage 5 of 17\nWang et al. BMC Bioinformatics          (2022) 23:459 \n \nprediction method by learning low-dimensional vector representations of features from \nheterogeneous networks, and adopting convolution neural networks (CNN) as classi -\nfication models. Wang et  al. [27] proposed a simple and efficient ligand protein bind -\ning prediction model based on a residual graph neural network (GNN) and attention. In \nthis network, the complex graph features are learned through the residual GNN. They \nintegrate these features into the attention module to form a complex protein vector for \nmultilayer perceptron processing. However, most graph neural network-based mod -\nels only examine the relationships between drugs and proteins and ignore many of the \nrelationships between each group of drugs and proteins. Based on these shortcomings, \nthis paper proposes a graph transformer-based method for predicting DTIs, taking into \naccount the relationship between each group of drug-protein pairs and the information \nof nodes and the full graph, as a way to predict the interactions between drug targets.\nMethods\nWe propose a drug-targeted interaction prediction method based on graph transformer \nnetwork (DTI-GTN). It not only introduces line graphs fusing the relationships between \neach group of drug-protein pairs, but it also allows GTN models to extract relation -\nships between nodes and the entire heterogeneous graph. Figure 1 depicts the DTI-GTN \nworkflow. We first aggregate multiple drug and protein information sources using Jac -\ncard similarity coefficients to generate similarity matrices for multiple drug and protein \nnetworks and then randomly walk the similarity matrices using the restart random walk \n(RWR) method to generate high-dimensional feature vectors for drugs and proteins. \nFinally we use principal component analysis (PCA) models to reduce the high-latitude \nfeature vectors of dimers.\nThe second stage is to create the drug-protein pair interaction line graph. To do so, we \nfirst created the drug-protein pairs by selecting the medications and proteins that have \nan interaction relationship based on the drug-protein adjacency matrix information. \nThen, using certain guidelines, we generate the edges between the drug-protein pairs \nas nodes. If the components of two drug-protein pairs have the same drug or protein, \nFig. 1 The DTI-GTN method’s flow chart. DTI-GTN includes a feature extractor based on heterogeneous \nnetworks, a feature selector based on principal component analysis, a converter to transform drug-protein \ninteraction maps into drug-target pairwise line maps, and a fully connected layer classifier based on the \nGTN model. First, using the Jaccard similarity coefficient and RWR algorithm, features were retrieved from a \nnetwork of seven medicines and proteins. Following that, a PCA model is used to reduce the dimensionality \nof these features, as well as to turn the drug-protein interaction graph into a drug-protein pairwise line graph. \nFinally, a GTN model was developed to forecast the interactions of each drug-protein pair\nPage 6 of 17Wang et al. BMC Bioinformatics          (2022) 23:459 \nthe edges between them are formed. Following completion of the preceding process, the \ninteraction line graphs of drug-protein pairs and node features are combined and input \ninto the GTN model so that features can be extracted, and the fully connected layer pre -\ndicts the association between each two drug-protein pairs to generate prediction results \nand prediction probabilities.\nHeterogeneous‑network‑based feature extractor\nHeterogeneous networks are constructed based on the following two types of networks. \nThe first type is drug-related networks, including drug-drug interactions, drug-disease \nassociations, drug-side effect associations, and drug similarity (based on the chemical \nstructure of the drug). The other type is the protein-related network, including protein-\ndisease association, protein-protein interaction, and protein similarity (based on the \nprimary sequence of the protein). First, we apply the Jaccard similarity method to each \nassociation matrix and interaction matrix to construct a similarity matrix.\nIn the drug-disease interaction matrix, for example, two rows of the adjacent matrix \nrepresent sets A and B, which represent the interactions between two different drugs \nand all diseases. The Jaccard coefficient of these two sets is the ratio of the size of the \nintersection of A and B to the size of the concurrent set of A and B. It is a measure of the \nsimilarity of two sets. This is how it is defined:\nThe Jaccard similarity coefficient is used to compare the similarity and difference \nbetween finite sample sets. The greater the value of the Jaccard coefficient, the greater \nthe similarity of the samples. The similarity matrix represents the similarity between \neach drug or protein node and all features in the column nodes. For example, element S i,j \nin the original adjacency matrix represents the similarity between row i and row j.\nIn the next step, the RWR method [28] is used for each similarity matrix. The basic \nidea of the random wander method is to traverse a graph starting from a vertex or a \nseries of vertices. At any vertex, the traverser will randomly jump to any vertex in the \ngraph with probability P , which is called the jump occurrence probability. A probability \ndistribution is derived after each tour, which shows the probability that each vertex in \nthe graph will be visited.\nThe RWR method is an improvement on the random wandering method. The traverser \nstarts from a node in the graph and faces two choices at each step, randomly selecting an \nadjacent node or returning to the starting node. The RWR method captures the multi -\nfaceted relationships between two nodes and the entire graph structure.\nAccording to the RWR principle, the greater the similarity between two nodes, the \ngreater their transfer probability. Thus, if two nodes’ distribution states are similar, they \ncan be considered to be in a similar position with respect to other nodes in the net -\nwork. This is because the RWR principle states that the greater the similarity between \ntwo nodes, the greater the likelihood of a leap between them [29].\nTaking the drug-disease similarity matrix A i,j as an example, we can obtain the drug-\ndisease transition transfer matrix B based on A i,j , where the elements B i,j describe the \ntransition probabilities of drug and disease node j, defined as follows:\n(1)Sim(A, B) = A ∩ B\nA ∪ B .\nPage 7 of 17\nWang et al. BMC Bioinformatics          (2022) 23:459 \n \nThen, the final drug-disease diffusion state matrix is obtained by iterative convergence as \nfollows:\nDuring the random wander, each element stores the probability of entering the disease \nnode after iteration from drug node i,st\ni is the result after t is iterated, pr denotes the \nprobability of restart, and ei is represented as an n-dimensional unit matrix.\nAfter transforming all similarity matrices into diffusion state matrices, all diffusion state \nmatrices of a drug network and a protein network are stitched together to yield two drug \nnetwork and protein network diffusion state matrices. The rows of the drug diffusion \nmatrix represent different drugs, and the columns represent the four nodes of drug, disease, \nside effect, and drug, with the element d i,j representing the probability of transfer between \nthe drug and node j. The protein diffusion state matrix’s rows represent different proteins, \nand the columns represent protein, disease, and protein nodes, with the element p i,j repre-\nsenting the transfer probability between the protein and node j.\nPrincipal component analysis feature selector\nThe diffusion state matrix vector obtained in the previous step is high-dimensional, noisy, \nand incomplete. To obtain the basic features, we manipulate the data using the PCA \nmodel [30], and the main processes of the PCA model are shown in the supplementary \ninformation.\nThe goal of PCA is to map high-dimensional data into a low-dimensional space by linear \nprojection, and to maximize the information content of the data in the projected dimen-\nsion, to use fewer data dimensions while retaining the characteristics of more original data \npoints. Therefore, PCA reduces the dimensionality of the original features while keeping \nthe “information content” as much as possible. In this study, we reduce both drug and pro-\ntein features to 125 dimensions. In this study, we reduced both drug and protein features to \n125 degrees.\nGraph transformer based interaction predictor\nThe transformer model, introduced by Google in 2017, is still widely used today. This model \nwas first used for machine translation tasks, and it allowed for fast parallelism using the \nself-attention mechanism. The most criticized drawback of RNNs is slow training, and the \ntransformer model can improve on this drawback. Dwivedi et al. [31] extended the trans-\nformer model to graphs to preserve the properties of the graph. Specifically, given the node \nfeature H (l) ={ H (l)\n1 ,H (l)\n2 ,··· ,H (l)\nn } , the multi-head attention of each edge from j to i is \ncalculated as follows.\n(2)B i,j = A i,j\nj A i,j\n.\n(3)St+1\ni = (1 − Pr)St\niB + prer\n(4)q(l)\nc,i = W (l)\nc,q h(l)\ni + b(l)\nc,q\n(5)k(l)\nc,i = W (l)\nc,k h(l)\nj + b(l)\nc,k\nPage 8 of 17Wang et al. BMC Bioinformatics          (2022) 23:459 \nAmong Formula (4) is the exponential scale dot-product function and d is the hid -\nden size of each head. For the C-th head attention,first transform the source feature \nand distant feature into q (l)\nc,i ∈ Rd  and k (l)\nc,i ∈ Rd  using different trainable parameters \nW (l)\nc,q , W (l)\nc,k , b(l)\nc,q, b(l)\nc,q,and then encode the edge features e i,j and add them to the key vector \nas additional information in each layer.\nAfter obtaining the multi-head attention of the graph, message aggregation is per -\nformed for distance j to source i:\nwhere C is the number of multi-headed attentions, || is the connection to attentions, and \nvc is used instead of the distance feature hj, j ∈ Rd  for weighted sum.\nFurthermore, according to Shi et al. [32]. Use a multi-headed attention matrix instead \nof the original normalized adjacency matrix as the transfer matrix for message passing, \nuse a gated residual connection between layers to prevent the model from being too \nsmooth, and finally apply graph transformer on the final output layer to apply averaging \non the multi-headed output and remove the non-linear transformation.\nExperiment\nDataset\nWe evaluated the performance of the DTI-GTN method using a drug-target interaction \nprediction task.\nWe obtain the dataset from Peng’s paper [11], which contains 12,015 nodes and \n1,895,445 edges. In this dataset all isolated nodes are excluded. This heterogeneous net -\nwork integrates four types of nodes (drug, protein, disease and side effect) and six types \nof edges (drug-protein interaction, drug-drug interaction, drug-disease association, \ndrug-side effect association, protein-disease association and protein-protein interac -\ntion). Peng et al. also extract information from known DTIs and drug-drug interactions \nbased on multiple databases to extract multiple information, drug nodes from the Drug -\nBank database [33] and protein nodes and protein interactions from the Human Protein \nReference Database [34]. Disease nodes, drug-disease and protein-disease associations \nwere extracted from the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database [35]. Side effect nodes \nand drug side effect associations were obtained from the side effect resource [36].\nFirst, we create some drug-related and protein-related similarity matrices. Drug-\nrelated similarity matrices include the drug-drug similarity matrix, drug-disease similar -\nity matrix, drug-side effect similarity matrix and drug similarity matrix.

BMC Bioinformatics          (2022) 23:459 \n \nsimilarity matrices include the protein-disease similarity matrix, protein-protein simi -\nlarity matrix and protein similarity matrix.\nWe next use the RWR algorithm to stitch together the diffusion state matrices of the \ndrug and protein networks, resulting in two diffusion state matrices representing the \ndrug and protein, respectively. The rows of the drug diffusion matrix represent differ -\nent drugs, the columns represent proteins, diseases, side effects and drug nodes, and the \nvalues in the matrix represent the associations between the drugs and the four biological \nentities. The rows of the protein diffusion state matrix represent the different proteins. \nThe columns indicate protein, disease, and drug nodes, and the values in the matrix \nshow the associations between the proteins and the three biological entities. We next \nused the PCA model to downscale the drug diffusion state matrix and protein diffusion \nstate matrix, yielding 708 drug feature vector matrices with 125 dimensions and 1512 \nprotein feature vector matrices with 125 dimensions, respectively.\nIn the next step, we construct the line graph. First, the drug and protein nodes with \nthe presence of edges are used as a new pair of drug-protein pair nodes according to \nthe drug-protein interaction relationship, so that each pair contains information about \nthe drug and the protein. Next, the edges of the line graph are constructed based on the \nrelationship between each group of drug-protein pairs, and a new adjacency matrix rep -\nresenting the relationship between the drug-protein pair nodes is obtained. Finally, we \nobtain the new drug-protein pair node features based on splicing the 125-dimensional \ndrug features with the 125-dimensional protein features.\nFollowing completion of the preceding steps, the training and test sets were divided, \nwith 80% of the positive and negative samples used as the training set, 10% of the posi -\ntive and negative samples used as the validation set, and 10% of the positive and nega -\ntive samples used as the test set. The known drug-protein interaction pairs were used \nas positive samples based on the known drug-protein interaction matrix, with a total of \n40,058 positive samples, and the same number of negative samples as positive samples \nwere randomly selected. The final experimental results were calculated as the mean plus \nor minus the standard deviation of the five training predictions, ensuring that the exper -\nimental results were accurate.\nParameters of models\nFor the RWR model, according to the parameters of the Peng et al. [11] model, we restart \nwith a probability of 0.5 and a number of 20 iterations. Our original drug feature input \ndimension is 2832, and our protein feature input dimension is 4536, and we use the PCA \nmodel to reduce dimensionality. The dimensionality is chosen as shown in Fig.  2, and \nthe value of AUROC/time varies with dimensionality, with 125 dimensions providing \nthe best balance. The final dimension was set to 125. The GTN model was run for 2000 \nbatches and optimized with the Adam method at an initial learning rate of 0.001, with \nthe loss calculated as a cross-entropy loss.\nEvaluation metrics\nModel testing and comparison are performed using AUROC [37] and AUPR [38] scores, \nwhich are commonly used evaluation criteria for machine learning and represent the \nPage 10 of 17Wang et al. BMC Bioinformatics          (2022) 23:459 \narea under the ROC curve and PR curve, respectively. The higher the score is, the higher \nthe prediction accuracy of the model and the better the performance of the model.\nThe ROC curve is a curve with the probability of false positives (FPR) as the horizontal \naxis and the probability of true positives (TPR) as the vertical axis.\nUsing the classification gives the probability of a positive class for each instance. Then, \nby setting a threshold value such as 0.6, a probability greater than or equal to 0.6 is con -\nsidered a positive class, and a probability less than 0.6 is considered a negative class. \nThe corresponding set of (FPR, TPR) can be calculated, and the coordinate points in \nthe plane can be obtained. As the threshold value decreases, an increasing number of \ninstances are classified as positive classes, but these positive classes are also mixed with \ntrue negative instances, i.e., TPR and FPR will both increase. The coordinate point (0,0) \ncorresponds to the maximum threshold value, and the coordinate point (1,1) corre -\nsponds to the minimum threshold value. The ROC curves are depicted in the Supple -\nmentary Material.\nTHE PR curve is a curve with recall as the horizontal axis and precision as the vertical \naxis.\nThe PR curves still reflect the classification performance well in the case of large differ -\nences in positive and negative sample proportions, as shown in the AUPR schematic in \nthe Supplementary Information.\n(10)FPR = FP\nFN + FP.\n(11)TPR = TP\nTP + FN .\n(12)Recall= TP\nTP + FN .\n(13)Precision= TP\nTP + FP .\nFig. 2 Values of different dimensional data are compared using AUROC/time. Whereas higher AUROC values \nand shorter time periods indicate better model performance\nPage 11 of 17\nWang et al. BMC Bioinformatics          (2022) 23:459 \n \nBaselines\nThe DTIs prediction task can be viewed as a binary classification problem, where known \ndrug-protein pair interactions can be considered positive samples and unknown drug-\nprotein pair interactions can be considered negative samples. In the experimental proce-\ndure, all positive samples were collected first, and then the number of positive samples \nwas used as an example to randomly sample the negative samples. Next, 80% of the posi-\ntive and negative sample pairs in the dataset were randomly selected as the training set \nto train the model parameters, 10% of the data were used as the validation set to adjust \nthe hyperparameters of the model and for initial evaluation of the model capabilities, \nand finally the remaining 10% of the data were used as the test set to evaluate the gen -\neralization ability of the final model. In our experiments we compared DTI-GTN with \nsix state-of-the-art graph neural network methods. Including (1) SSCGCN: Instead of \nusing Laplacian Matrix to convolve the graph, this model uses Chebyshev polynomials \nas the convolution kernel, and the larggest feature is that it does not need to decom -\npose the feature vector. (2) GAT: The shortcomings of previous problems such as graph-\nbased convolution are addressed by using masked self-attentive layers. By sacking layers \n(in which nodes are able to aggregate the features of their neighbors), different weights \ncan be assigned to different nodes in the neighborhood without any expensive matrix \noperations or prior knowledge of the graph structure. (3) GCN : proposes a scalable \nsemi-supervised learning method for graph structure data, which is based on an efficient \nvariant of convolutional neural networks that can directly manipulate graphs. (4) EGC \n: uses a new adaptive filtering method that achieves lower memory consumption and \nlatency and is suitable for gas pedal implementation. (5) Hypergraph: introduces hyper -\ngraph convolution and hypergraph attention in the family of graph neural networks. \nHypergraph convolution defines the basic formula for performing convolution on hyper-\ngraphs, while hypergraph attention further enhances representation learning by utilizing \nthe attention module. (6) ResGatedGraphConv: The LSTM and ConvNets models for \ngraphs are proposed, iterating over the graph multiple times and introducing the idea of \nresidual networks to enable the model to scale to graphs of arbitrary size. (7) In GNN-\nFiLM, the representation of the target node of an edge is used to compute a transforma -\ntion that can be applied to all incoming messages, allowing featurewise modulation of \nthe passed information.\nPerformance evaluation on predicting drug‑target interactions\nTo ensure the accuracy of the experimental results and avoid pseudo-random results, all \nmodels are trained five times under the same conditions, with the results averaged and \nstandard deviations added and subtracted. The final AUROC and AUPR values for each \nmodel are shown in Table  1. The AUROC value of DTI-GTN is 0.9973, which is 0.0017 \nhigher than that of the next best model DTI-Film. The AUPR value is 0.0018 higher \nthan that of DTI-Film. In the drug-target interaction prediction task, DTI-GTN outper -\nformed the other six state-of-the-art DTIs prediction methods.\nMeanwhile, Fig.  3 depicts the trends in training loss and ROC values for various \nmethods during the training process. According to the two figures, the training loss \nof all seven models gradually decreases and the ROC value gradually increases as the \nPage 12 of 17Wang et al. BMC Bioinformatics          (2022) 23:459 \nepoch value increases, but when compared, their convergence speed differs. The DTI-\nGTN method, which is faster and better than the other models, begins to converge \nafter approximately 200 rounds.\nIn addition, we also compare DTI-GTN with other models and its classical learning \nmethods. (1) DTI-CDF: In this method the prediction performance of DTIS is further \nimproved by using path classification-based multi-similar features of DTIs heteroge -\nneous graphs and a depth-cascaded deep forest-based model (CDF). (2) DTI-CNN: \nIn this method a self-coding model with restarted random wandering and denoising \nis used to handle incomplete, high-dimensional heterogeneous features of the data \nsource. A deep cnn model is used to process low-dimensional feature vectors and \npredict the probability of interaction between each pair of drugs and proteins. (3) \nRandom forest: In this method for each node, m features are randomly selected and \nthe decision of each node in the decision tree is determined based on these features. \nBased on these m features, the best way to split them is calculated so that each tree is \nconstructed. (4): K nearest neighbors: In this method given the training dataset, for a \nnew input instance, find the K instances that are closest to the instance, then the new \ninput instance belongs to the same class as the majority of these K instances.\nSimilarly, the experimental results were averaged over five trials plus or minus the \nstandard deviation, and the final results are shown in Table  2. DTI-CDF performed \nthe best among the other classical methods, but GTI-GTN outperformed it by 0.0075 \nand 0.0075 for AUROC and AUPR, respectively, when compared to the other four \nclassical methods, and DTI-GTN also performed the best in the drug-target interac -\ntion prediction task.\nTable 3 compares the prediction results of our DTI-GTN method to those of other \nmodels that do not use line graphs, and in this experiment, we add two representative \ngraph neural network models for comparison. (1) NEDTP [39]: This method uses 15 \nheterogeneous information networks to build a similarity network, and after extracting \ntopological information using random wandering, the gradient boosting decision tree \nmodel is used to complete the classification task. (2) Moltrans [40]: This method uses a \nknowledge inspired sub-structural pattern mining algorithm and an augmented trans -\nformer encoder to capture the relationships between substructures for a more accurate \nprediction of DTI interactions. The AUROC and AUPR values for the model without \nusing the line graph in Table 3 are lower than those of the model using the line graph in \nTables 1 and 2, demonstrating the effectiveness of our use of the line graph.The AUROC \nTable 1 Comparison with graphical neural network models based on line graphs\nModel AUROC AUPR\nDTI-GTN 0.9973 ± 0.0006 0.9976 ± 0.0006\nDTI-Film 0.9956 ± 0.0007 0.9958 ± 0.0008\nDTI-GAT 0.9946 ± 0.0004 0.9948 ± 0.0002\nDTI-GCN 0.9935 ± 0.0006 0.9942 ± 0.0003\nDTI-EGC 0.9928 ± 0.0010 0.9945 ± 0.0003\nDTI-RGG 0.9811 ± 0.0028 0.9844 ± 0.0022\nDTI-Hypergraph 0.9796 ± 0.0059 0.9829 ± 0.0045\nPage 13 of 17\nWang et al.

Each set of drug-protein pairs corresponds to two \npredicted results. For example, if A and C are drugs, B and D are proteins, and AB \nand CD are a set of predicted drug-target pairs, it is demonstrated that drug A inter -\nacts with protein D and drug C interacts with protein B. Our prediction results were \nchecked in Drugbank, and the test results were further analyzed.\n5-Hydroxytryptamine receptor 1A is abbreviated as HTR1A. The two pairs of drug-\nprotein pairs with the highest predicted results were Propranolol-HTR1A and Pind -\nolol-HTR1A. Propranolol [41] has a significant affinity for HTR1A. Pindolol [42] is \na beta adrenoceptor antagonist. It facilitates frontocortical dopaminergic and adren -\nergic transmission primarily by activation of beta 1/2-ARs and, to a lesser degree, by \nstimulationing HTR1A receptors. In addition, the selective HTR1A receptor antago -\nnist can slightly attenuate the pindolol-induced increase in DA and NAD levels.\nsecond set of drug-protein pairs in the prediction results are Zolmitriptan-HTR1A \nand Naratriptan-HTR1A. Zolmitriptan [42] is a novel 5-hydroxytryptamine recep -\ntor agonist with proven efficacy in the acute treatment of migraine with or without \npreceding aura. Naratriptan [43] has a central effect in the trigeminovascular system, \nselectively inhibiting afferent activity in cardiovascular neurones, via HTR1B, HTR1D \nand HTR1A receptors.\nMuscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3 is abbreviated as CHRM3. The last pair of drug-\nprotein pairs are Mivacurium-CHRM3 and Pancuronium-CHRM3. Mivacurium [44] is \na short-acting non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent. Muscle relaxants cause \nbronchospasm via histamine release or by acting on muscarinic receptors. Pancuronium \n[45] is a neuromuscular blocker used as an adjunct to general anesthesia to facilitate tra -\ncheal intubation. Neuromuscular blocking drugs can inhibit not only nicotinic but also \nmuscarinic receptors and thereby affect not only skeletal but also smooth muscle tone.\nConclusion\nWe propose a novel drug-target prediction model based on graph transformer network \n(DTI-GTN) in this paper. Firstly, we use seven different level relationships of drugs and \ntargets to construct features of drug-target interaction with jaccard similarity and ran -\ndom walk with restart method. Then, we use line graph to transform drug-target inter -\naction from nodes into links of a new graph. After that, we introduce graph transformer \nnetwork to predict drug-target interaction. We compare our model with other repre -\nsentative models on AUROC and AUPR values. The experiment results on DTIs network \nshow our model is comparable with other models. Our DTI-GTN method can provide a \nnew pattern for understanding drug-target interaction relationship.\nAbbreviations\nDTI  Drug-target interactions\nAUROC  The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve\nAUPR  The area under the Precision and Recall curve\nTPR  True positive rate\nFPR  False positive rate\nPCA  Principal component analysis\nGTN  Graph transformer network\nRWR   Random walk with restart\nPage 16 of 17Wang et al.
