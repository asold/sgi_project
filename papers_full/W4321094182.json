    "abstract": "As marine observation technology develops rapidly, underwater optical image object detection is beginning to occupy an important role in many tasks, such as naval coastal defense tasks, aquaculture, etc. However, in the complex marine environment, the images captured by an optical imaging system are usually severely degraded. Therefore, how to detect objects accurately and quickly under such conditions is a critical problem that needs to be solved. In this manuscript, a novel framework for underwater object detection based on a hybrid transformer network is proposed. First, a lightweight hybrid transformer-based network is presented that can extract global contextual information. Second, a fine-grained feature pyramid network is used to overcome the issues of feeble signal disappearance. Third, the test-time-augmentation method is applied for inference without introducing additional parameters. Extensive experiments have shown that the approach we have proposed is able to detect feeble and small objects in an efficient and effective way. Furthermore, our model significantly outperforms the latest advanced detectors with respect to both the number of parameters and the mAP by a considerable margin. Specifically, our detector outperforms the baseline model by 6.3 points, and the model parameters are reduced by 28.5 M.",
