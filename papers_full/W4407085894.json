  "abstract": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced various benchmarks in Natural Language Processing (NLP), the challenge of low-resource tasks persists, primarily due to the scarcity of data and difficulties in annotation. This study introduces LoRE, a framework designed for zero-shot relation extraction in low-resource settings, which blends distant supervision with the powerful capabilities of LLMs. LoRE addresses the challenges of data sparsity and noise inherent in traditional distant supervision methods, enabling high-quality relation extraction without requiring extensive labeled data. By leveraging LLMs for zero-shot open information extraction and incorporating heuristic entity and relation alignment with semantic disambiguation, LoRE enhances the accuracy and relevance of the extracted data. Low-resource tasks refer to scenarios where labeled data are extremely limited, making traditional supervised learning approaches impractical. This study aims to develop a robust framework that not only tackles these challenges but also demonstrates the theoretical and practical implications of zero-shot relation extraction. The Chinese Person Relationship Extraction (CPRE) dataset, developed under this framework, demonstrates LoRE’s proficiency in extracting person-related triples. The CPRE dataset consists of 1000 word pairs, capturing diverse semantic relationships. Extensive experiments on the CPRE, IPRE, and DuIE datasets show significant improvements in dataset quality and a reduction in manual annotation efforts. These findings highlight the potential of LoRE to advance both the theoretical understanding and practical applications of relation extraction in low-resource settings. Notably, the performance of LoRE on the manually annotated DuIE dataset attests to the quality of the CPRE dataset, rivaling that of manually curated datasets, and highlights LoRE’s potential for reducing the complexities and costs associated with dataset construction for zero-shot and low-resource tasks.",
