INTRODUCTION\nWhen the power transformer is cut-out operation and in vari-\nous test operations [1]–[3], the internal magnetic ﬂux density\nin the iron core does not fall to zero and thus an unknown\nresidual ﬂux density (B r ) is produced, which is resulted by\nthe hysteresis characteristics of iron core materials [4]–[6].\nWhen the transformer is switched to connect with power\ngrid again, a magnetizing inrush current will be produced\nas the existence of Br [7], [8]. Sometimes this current may\nbe 6 to 8 times higher than the rated state current [9],\nwhich will result the transformer failing to connect with the\npower grid. To suppress inrush current, synchronous closing\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Giambattista Gruosso\n.\ntechnology and phase selection closing technology are pro-\nposed in [10]–[12], on the premise of Br magnitude and\ndirection being obtained [13]. Moreover, demagnetization\nwithout knowing the magnitude of Br in the transformer core\nis not only time consuming and laborious, but also has a poor\ndemagnetization effect [14]. Thus, it is of great signiﬁcance\nto accurately detect Br in the transformer core for the safe\noperation of large power transformers and even power grids.\nAt present, there are ﬁve main methods for measuring the\nBr in the transformer core:\n1) Estimation method. When large power transformers\nleave the factory, empirical estimation method is generally\nused to estimate Br in the iron core. And, it is considered that\nBr is 20 % - 80 % of the saturated ﬂux density [15]. In [16],\nBr is found not to higher than 0.7 times of the saturated ﬂux\nVOLUME 8, 2020\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.\nFor more information, see https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ 171479\nC. Huoet al.: Residual Flux Density Measurement Method of Single-Phase Transformer Core Based on Time Constant\ndensity by analyzing more than 500 transformers. However,\nthis method can only roughly estimate the range of Br and\ncannot accurately predict the magnitude of Br in the iron core.\n2) Indirect measurement method. In [17], the Br before\nenergization is calculated based on the obtained peak value\nof the magnetizing inrush current after the transformer is\nenergized. However, it is not sure that this method can\nbe applied to Br measurement before the transformer is\nclosed.\n3) Pre-magnetization method. By applying larger current\nto the core, the internal ﬂux density of the core is changed\nfrom original Br to saturated magnetic ﬂux density. After\nthat the phase selection closing technology or demagnetiza-\ntion method is used to suppress the magnetizing inrush cur-\nrent [18]–[20]. In [21], the DC voltage excitation with varying\npolarity to measure Br is proposed, which is essentially the\nsame as the pre-magnetization method. Although the mag-\nnitude of Br can be measured, the Br has been changed to\nsaturated ﬂux density, and a large current to saturate the iron\ncore is required. Finally, for demagnetizing Br , the extra time\nand expensive equipment are required.\n4) V oltage integration method. This method is based on\nthe electromagnetic induction law [22], [23]. By recording\nthe voltage waveform at the transformer opening time, the Br\nis obtained by the voltage integration method. However,\nthe upper limit of the integration (the time of opening) is\nnot easily determined. Due to hysteresis characteristics of\nthe ferromagnetic material, measured Br at the moment of\nopening is different from Br after stabilization and thus the\nfeasibility of this method is limited.\n5) Transient excitation measurement method. In [24],\nthe Br is obtained by establishing the relationship between\nBr and magnetizing current. However, this method uses the\nmagnetization curve in the simulation model, thus this accu-\nracy is greatly reduced and the Br direction is not judged.\nTo address the limitations of this approach, in [25], author\nanalyzes the relationship between Br and transient current\ndifference. However, the measurement time of transient cur-\nrent difference is not easily determined, which may result in\na lower accuracy of calculated Br . In [26], the Br is calcu-\nlated based on the positive time constant. However, the Br is\nonly measured in known Br directions, and not in unknown\ndirections. Moreover, the inﬂuence of external excitation on\nBr is not analyzed. Therefore, there is no effective method for\nmeasurement Br in the iron core.\nTo accurately measure Br in the iron core, this paper\nproposes a new Br measurement method. This method has\nseveral improvements over the above methods as follows:\n1) The relationship between Br , the difference of the pos-\nitive and negative time constant, and external DC voltage is\ntheoretically analyzed. Then, the square iron core is taken as\nthe research object, and the empirical formula for measuring\nBr is obtained by ﬁnite element method (FEM).\n2) Through analysis the relationship between the relative\ndifferential permeability (µ rd) and the corresponding time\nconstant at Br , the Br direction is determined.\nFIGURE 1. The generation principle ofBr in the iron core under different\nmagnetization states.\n3) Through numerical simulation analysis, the range of\napplied DC excitation is analyzed and determined. Then the\nBr test platform of the square core is established to verify the\naccuracy of proposed method. Experimental results prove that\nthe Br measurement method proposed in this paper has higher\naccuracy compared with existing methods.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. The basic\nprinciple of proposed Br measurement method is analyzed in\nSection II. Section III obtains the proposed empirical formula\nof the square iron core in FEM. In Section IV , the accuracy\nof proposed empirical formula and the feasibility of proposed\nBr measurement method are veriﬁed in the square iron core\ntest platform. Section V concludes the paper.\nII. PRINCIPLE OF PROPOSED RESIDUAL FLUX DENSITY\nMEASUREMENT METHOD\nA. GENERATION PRINCIPLE OF RESIDUAL FLUX DENSITY\nWhen the transformer core is externally excited, due to the\nmagnetic domain structure changes inside the core material,\nthe ferromagnet exhibits certain magnetic properties to the\noutside [27]. Fig. 1 shows Br generation principle under dif-\nferent magnetization states. As shown, the magnetization pro-\ncess is divided into three states: 1) Reversible magnetization\nstate. When the external magnetic ﬁeld strength (H ) increases\nfrom 0 to point a, the magnetic domains change will occur in\nreversible magnetization stage. And then when H disappears,\nBr ′′is almost not generated. 2) Irreversible magnetization\nstate. As H increases to point b, the magnetic domains move-\nment begins to change from reversible magnetic domain wall\ndisplacement to irreversible magnetic domain wall displace-\nment, thereby exhibiting stronger magnetism to the outside\nworld. When H suddenly disappears, the magnetic domain\nstate cannot be restored to the original state, but formed a\nnew state, which results in a phase difference between B\nand H, which is called hysteresis. At this time, Br ′in the\niron core cannot be ignored. 3) Saturated magnetization state.\nWhen H continues to increase to point c, the magnetic domain\nmovement enters the saturated state. After H disappears,\na large Br is generated and is not ignored.\n171480 VOLUME 8, 2020\nC. Huoet al.: Residual Flux Density Measurement Method of Single-Phase Transformer Core Based on Time Constant\nFIGURE 2. The basic principle of proposedBr measurement method in\nthis paper, (a) the measurement circuit of the proposed method and\n(b) the positive and negative transient current waveforms.\nB. PROPOSED RESIDUAL FLUX DENSITY\nMEASUREMENT METHOD\nThe square iron core is selected as the research object in\nthis paper. Fig. 2 shows the basic principle of proposed Br\nmeasurement method. As shown in Fig. 2(a), the measure-\nment circuit of proposed method is presented. Br is the initial\nresidual ﬂux density in the iron core determined by a large\ncurrent. The DC voltage u(t) is applied to the measuring\nwinding to exaction a test ﬂux density (B t ) on initial Br . When\na positive DC voltage with the same polarity is applied, Bt is\ngenerated on the basis of the initial Br so that the actual Br in\nthe iron core will increase. In addition, when using a negative\nDC voltage with the opposite polarity to Br , -Bt is generated\non the initial Br and the magnitude of Br will decrease. At the\nsame time, corresponding transient current i(t) is generated,\nas shown in Fig. 2(b).\nWhen a positive DC voltage is applied in the measuring\nwinding, the positive transient current ip(t) increases. While\na negative DC voltage with the opposite polarity to Br is\napplied, the negative transient current in(t) will be decreased.\nHowever, compared to the ﬁrst process, due to the hysteresis\nphenomenon of the iron material, the change rate of ip(t)\nis slower than in(t) (see Fig. 2 (b)). The change rate of\nip(t) or in(t) is reﬂected by the positive or negative time\nconstant (τp or τn) in the transient process. Time constant\nis deﬁned as this moment when the steady-state value Is\nof the transient current drops 1/e. Thus, the direction of Br\nis determined by comparing τp and τn, and the relationship\nbetween Br and the difference 1τ of τp and τn is found to\ndetermine the magnitude of Br in the iron core. 1τ at Br is\nexpressed as\n1τ =\n⏐⏐τp −τn\n⏐\n⏐ (1)\nAccording to above analysis, the proposed relationship for\ncalculating Br in the iron core is expressed as\nBr =f (1τ) (2)\nThis method also considers the inﬂuence of different exter-\nnal DC voltage (It is also the applied Bt value) on Br in the\niron core. To ensure higher accuracy of proposed measure-\nment method, when the DC voltage is applied, it is acceptable\nto keep the change rate of Br is within 10 %. In the follow-\ning sections, this relationship will be obtained by FEM and\nveriﬁed by experiments.\nC. DETERMINING DIRECTION OF\nRESIDUAL FLUX DENSITY\nDue to the hysteresis phenomenon of the ferromagnetic mate-\nrial, its magnetization state cannot be restored to the mag-\nnetic neutral state, but maintains the Br state. Therefore,\nthe Br depends mainly on the magnetic domain structure\nchange from maximum ﬂux density state to Br state, which is\nreﬂected by the change of the relative differential permeabil-\nity (µrd) at Br [26]. As shown in Fig. 1, µrd at Br is deﬁned as\nthe ratio of magnetic ﬂux density increment dB and magnetic\nﬁeld strength increment dH.\nµrd = 1\nµ0\ndB\ndH (3)\nWhen H changes from positive to negative in the vicinity\nof Br , the magnetization ability of magnetic domain increases\nfrom small to large and thus µrd at Br also increases from\nsmall to large, as shown in Fig. 1. The relationship between\npositive and negative relative differential permeability (µ rp\nand µrn) at Br is as follows:\nµrp <µrn (4)\nBased on the magnetic circuit analysis [25], the relation-\nship between the equivalent inductance Leq and µrd at Br is\nexpressed as\nLeq =N2Sµ0\nl µrd (5)\nwhere N expresses the ratio of measuring winding, S and l\nrepresent the cross-sectional area and the average magnetic\npath length of the iron core, respectively. µ0 expresses the\nvacuum permeability of air, and its value is 4π ×10−7 H/m.\nWhen the DC voltage is applied, the measurement circuit\nis modeled as a RL parallel equivalent circuit, as shown\nin Fig. 3. As shown, Rs includes the internal source resistance,\nVOLUME 8, 2020 171481\nC. Huoet al.: Residual Flux Density Measurement Method of Single-Phase Transformer Core Based on Time Constant\nFIGURE 3. The equivalent circuit when the DC excitation is applied.\nconnecting wires resistance, and winding resistance. Leq rep-\nresents equivalent magnetized inductance of measuring wind-\ning, which is effect by the magnetic ﬂux in the iron core. RFe\nexpresses the iron loss resistance. When the appropriate DC\nvoltage is applied, the change rate of Br in the iron core is\nwithin 10 %. At this time, resistance RFe can be ignored in\nthe transient progress.\nWhen the external DC voltage is applied, the time constant\nτ in the circuit is described as:\nτ =Leq\nR (6)\nwhere R expresses the total resistance in the circuit. Accord-\ning to (5) and (6), the relationship between τand µrd at Br is\nexpressed as\nτ =N2Sµ0\nRl µrd (7)\nIt can be seen that the changes of µrp and µrn at Br can be\ndirectly reﬂected by τp and τn in the transient circuit. Based\non (4) and (7), the relationship between τp and τn at Br is\nexpressed as\nτp <τn (8)\nThus, the direction of Br is determined by comparing τp\nand τn at Br when the appropriate DC voltage is applied.\nIII. PARAMETERS DETERMINATION AND\nSIMULATION ANALYSIS\nIn this paper, an experiment platform which adopts square\nstacked steel sample is built, as shown in Fig. 12. The\nmain dimension of the iron core is determined as the S =\n0.0016 m 2, l =1.92 m. Fig. 4 shows the square iron core\nmodel in FEM. As shown, the turns of preset Br winding are\n50, and the turns of measuring winding are 10. Before the\nnumerical simulation analysis, it is necessary to discuss the\nrange of preset Br and the selection of external DC excitation.\nA. RANGE OF RESIDUAL FLUX DENSITY\nWhen the measurement frequency is 5 Hz, the magnetization\ncurve of stacked steel sample is obtained, as shown in Fig. 5.\nAs shown, the saturated ﬂux density of the iron core mate-\nrial can reach 1.8 T. According to the empirical estimation\nmethod [15], [16], the Br is 20 % -70 % of the saturated\nﬂux density in the iron core. Thus, the range of preset Br is\nFIGURE 4. The square iron core model set in FEM.\nTABLE 1. Preset residual flux density values.\nFIGURE 5. The magnetization curve of steel sample at measurement\nfrequency is 5 Hz.\n0.36 T-1.26 T in the simulation and experiments. Preset Br\nvalues selected in this paper are shown in TABLE 1.\nB. SELECTION OF EXTERNAL DC EXCITATION\nWhen Br is zero, Bt value is determined by applying DC\nvoltage. Then, when Br is not zero, DC voltages of the same\nmagnitude and different directions are loaded. Due to the hys-\nteresis effect of the iron core, the change of Br is smaller than\nthe actual applied Bt value. Moreover, when applied Bt value\nis larger, the change of initial Br becomes larger. To improve\nthe measurement accuracy, the applied DC voltage cannot\nmake the change rate of initial Br exceed 10 %.\nAs shown in Fig. 5, the overall magnetization curve is\ndivided into three stages: 1) In the stage of reversible mag-\nnetic domain wall displacement. The maximum ﬂux density\nin the iron core can approximately reach 0.2 T. When H\ndisappears, the magnetization can return to the original state\nalong the original path. At this time, Br is close to zero.\n2) In the stage of irreversible magnetic domain wall dis-\nplacement. When H disappears, the magnetization cannot be\nrestored to the original magnetization state, but there is a\nphase difference between B and H, resulting in hysteresis.\n171482 VOLUME 8, 2020\nC. Huoet al.: Residual Flux Density Measurement Method of Single-Phase Transformer Core Based on Time Constant\nAt this time, Br cannot be ignored. 3) In the approaching\nthe saturation stage. Hysteresis phenomenon is more obvious\nthan the previous two stages. When H disappears, generated\nBr is too large to be ignored. When the applied Bt is greater\nthan the ﬂux density in the reversible magnetic domain wall\ndisplacement stage, the change of initial Br is larger affected.\nTherefore, the applied Bt value is not larger than 0.2 T. At this\ntime, the relationship between B and H is almost linear,\nas shown in Fig. 5. The applied Bt is expressed as\nBt =µH (9)\nwhere the permeability µis obtained by the data ﬁtting and\nits value is 0.05 H/m.\nAccording to the ampere loop law, the above equation is\nobtained:\nu(t)\nR ·N =H ·l (10)\nwhere N expresses the turns of the measuring winding and its\nvalue is 10. R expresses the total resistance in the measure-\nment circuit and its value is 5.04 .\nAccording to (9) and (10), the external DC voltage u(t) can\nbe obtained.\nu (t)= Rl\nµN Bt (11)\nWhen a positive or negative DC voltage is applied, due to\nthe hysteresis characteristics of core material, Br in the iron\ncore is changed from initial Br to new Br1 or Br2. The change\n1B of ﬂux density is different in the positive and negative\ndirections. To describe the effect of external excitation on Br ,\nthe change rate Br % of Br is deﬁned as\nBr % =\n⏐⏐⏐⏐\n1B\nBr\n⏐\n⏐⏐⏐ ×100% (12)\nwhere the positive 1B is expressed by Br1 - Br , and the\nnegative 1B is expressed by Br2 - Br .\nFig. 6 shows the change of Br % under different Bt when Br\nis 0.83 T. As shown, the positive Br1 % and negative Br2 %\nincrease as applied Bt value increases. Since the change of\nµrp at Br is smaller than µrn, the magnetization ability in the\npositive direction is weaker than that of the negative, and thus\nBr1 % is less than Br2 %. When - Bt is applied, the variation\nof Br % is greater than that with the positive. Therefore,\nwhen Br2 % is less than 10 %, the maximum value of Bt is\ndetermined.\nFig. 7 shows the change of Br % under different Br and\ndifferent Bt . As shown, as Br increases, corresponding Br1 %\nand Br2 % gradually become smaller. And, Br2 % is less than\n10 % under the situations: 1) when Bt is less than 0.10 T,\ncorresponding Br2 % is less than 10 % in the range of preset\nBr and 2) when Bt is larger than 0.10 T and less than 0.15 T,\ncorresponding Br2 % is less than 10 % at Br >1.0 T. The\nabove two situations can meet the conditions of Bt selection.\nThus, Bt value is selected in the range of 0.15 T.\nAt the same time, when the positive and negative Bt are\napplied, τp and τn are obtained by corresponding transient\nFIGURE 6. The change ofBr % under differentBt when Br is 0.83 T,\n(a) the change ofBr1 % and (b) the change ofBr2 %.\nTABLE 2. Applied test flux density and DC voltage value.\ncurrent. When applied Bt value is 0.05 T, 0.1 T and 0.15 T,\nthe changes of τp and τn are shown in Fig. 8. It can be seen that\ncorresponding 1τis more and more obvious as Br increases.\nWhen Bt =0.05 T and preset Br <0.44 T, τp is close to τn\nand thus corresponding 1τ is almost to zero. At this time,\nthe direction of Br in the iron core is not easily determined.\nTo make the direction of Br can be accurately judged,\nthe applied Bt value is not less than 0.05 T. Based on the\nabove analysis, applied Bt value varies within the range of\n0.05 T - 0.15 T, and then corresponding u(t) is obtained by\nequation (11), as shown in TABLE 2.\nC. EMPIRICAL FORMULA FOR CALCULATING\nRESIDUAL FLUX DENSITY\nFig. 9 shows the ip(t) and in(t) waveforms when Bt is 0.1 T\nand Br is 0.83 T. As shown, τp and τn can be obtained by ip(t)\nand in(t) waveforms. The time constant is mainly affected\nby the equivalent inductance value in the equivalent circuit,\nwhich is related to µrd at Br . When the positive and negative\nBt is applied, as Br increases, the change of µrp is smaller\nthan µrn. Thus, τp is less than τn at different Br . By comparing\nτp and τn, the direction of Br in the iron core is determined.\nVOLUME 8, 2020 171483\nC.

The change of theτp and τn at differentBr when theBt is\n0.05 T, 0.10 T and 0.15 T.\nAfter determining Br direction in the iron core, to obtain\nthe empirical formula of square iron core, the relationship\nbetween Br and 1τ at different Br and different Bt is ana-\nlyzed. When Bt is 0.1 T and -0.1 T, the ip(t) and in(t) wave-\nforms and corresponding time constant changes are shown\nin Fig. 10(a) and Fig. 10(b). It can be seen that τp or τn is\nobtained by corresponding transient current waveforms (see\nFig. 10(c)). As shown in Fig. 10(c), the change of τp linearly\ndecreases as Br increases, which is greatly affected by Br in\nthe iron core. While the change of τn is slow with the increase\nof Br and is small under the inﬂuence of Br .\nFIGURE 9. The ip (t) andin (t) waveforms whenBt is 0.1T andBr is 0.83T.\nFIGURE 10.

EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION\nA. EXPERIMENTAL PLATFORM\nTo verify the accuracy of proposed empirical formula, this\npaper establishes an experimental platform of proposed Br\nmeasurement method, as shown in Fig. 12. The current signal\nIm in preset Br winding and the applied DC voltage u(t)\nin the measuring winding are respectively obtained by the\nsignal generator. Firstly, a large current signal Im is applied\nin the preset Br winding to generate an initial Br in the iron\ncore. Then, u(t) is sent through the signal generator, and\nampliﬁed by the power ampliﬁer, applied in the measuring\nFIGURE 13. The relationship between preset Br and magnetization\ncurrent Im.\nwinding to result Bt . When Bt is applied, the change of\naverage ﬂux density in the iron core is observed by the\nFlux-meter 480. Furthermore, the positive and negative tran-\nsient current waveforms are observed and stored by the oscil-\nloscope. Finally, through the positive and negative transient\ncurrent waveforms, corresponding τp and τn are obtained.\nFrom this the direction of Br in the iron core is determined by\ncomparing τp and τn, and the magnitude of Br is calculated\nby proposed empirical formula between Br and 1τ.\nB. PRESET RESIDUAL FLUX DENSITY\nFig. 13 shows the relationship between preset B rp and mag-\nnetization current I m. As shown, there is a piecewise linear\nrelationship between preset B rp and I m. When B r changes\nfrom 0.4 T to 0.8 T, the relationship between preset B rp and\ncorresponding Im is expressed as:\nBrp =5.54I2\nm +3.62Im −0.48 (14)\nWhen B r changes from 0.8 T to 1.26 T, the relationship\nbetween preset B rp and corresponding I m is expressed as:\nBrp =0.05Im +0.81 (15)\nThrough (14) and (15), Br value in the iron core can be\npredicted more accurately.\nC. RESIDUAL FLUX DENSITY MEASUREMENT\nFig. 14 shows the ip(t) and in(t) waveforms when Br is 0.83 T\nand Bt is 0.1 T. It can be seen that τp and τn are obtained by\ncorresponding transient current waveforms. Since the change\nrate of ip(t) is greater than that of in(t), τp is less than τn in\nthe transient progress. By comparing τp and τn, the smaller τp\nis determined as the positive time constant, and the positive\ndirection of Br is determined. And, the larger τn is determined\nas the negative time constant, and the negative direction of\nBr in the iron core is determined. In addition, the simulation\nresults are in good agreement with the measured transient\ncurrent waveforms. Experimental results prove the accuracy\nand feasibility of proposed measurement method in FEM.\nFig. 15 shows the ip(t) and in(t) waveforms under different\nBr when Bt is 0.1 T and -0.1 T. When preset Br is 1.18 T,\nVOLUME 8, 2020 171485\nC. Huoet al.: Residual Flux Density Measurement Method of Single-Phase Transformer Core Based on Time Constant\nFIGURE 14.

As shown in Fig. 15(a) and\nFig. 15(b), measured ip(t) and in(t) waveforms noise are\nrelatively large. To reduce the measurement error caused by\nthis noise, the moving average method is used to suppress\nthis noise [29]. The processed transient current waveforms\nare shown in Fig. 15(c) and Fig. 15(d). Through the processed\ntransient current waveforms, τp and τn are calculated and then\ncorresponding 1τ is substituted into (13) to calculate Br .\nThe measurement data are shown in TABLE 5. As shown,\nthe preset Brp is obtained by (14) and (15), and the Brv\nmeasured in the voltage integration method [21] is obtained\nby Flux-meter 480. The relative error ε1 % between Brp and\ncalculated Br and the relative error ε2 % between Brp and Brv\nare expressed as\nε1% =\n⏐⏐Br −Brp\n⏐\n⏐\nBrp\n×100% (16)\nε2% =\n⏐⏐Brv −Brp\n⏐\n⏐\nBrp\n×100% (17)\nTABLE 5. Measurement data.\nFIGURE 16. The change ofε1 % at differentBr when Bt is 0.05 T, 0.1 T\nand 0.15 T.\nAs shown in TABLE 5, when Brp changes from 0.44 T\nto 1.18 T, ε1 % is within 4.58 %, which is less than ε2 %.\nCompared with voltage integration method, proposed empir-\nical formula has higher accuracy. Fig. 16 shows the change of\nε1 % when Bt value is 0.05 T, 0.1 T and 0.15 T. In engineering,\nit is best to control the relative error range within 5 %. When\nBt is 0.05 T, the measured transient current signal is weaker\nso that there is a higher accuracy necessary to the experimen-\ntal device. And the external electromagnetic interference is\nlarge, which is not conducive to signal detection. When Bt is\n0.1 T, ε1 % is within 4.58 %, which meets the requirements\nof engineering error. When Bt is 0.15 T, the smaller the Br\nis, the greater the ε1 % is. And when Br is less than about\n0.7 T, ε1 % is greater than 5 %, indicating that the range of\nmeasurement Br is narrow. In summary, when Bt is 0.1 T,\nthe measurement is best in a wide range of Br in the iron core.\nV. CONCLUSION\nThis paper presents a residual ﬂux density measurement\nmethod of the single-phase transformer core based on time\nconstant. Compared with existing residual ﬂux density mea-\nsurement methods, the main advantages of proposed method\ninclude: 1) when the appropriate DC excitation that is the\npositive or negative direction with residual ﬂux density is\napplied, the direction of residual ﬂux density is accurately\ndetermined by comparing the positive and negative time con-\nstant. 2) The magnitude of residual ﬂux density in different\ndirections is calculated by proposed relationship between\n171486 VOLUME 8, 2020\nC. Huoet al.: Residual Flux Density Measurement Method of Single-Phase Transformer Core Based on Time Constant\nresidual ﬂux density and time constant difference, and its\naccuracy is veriﬁed for a square iron core. When the applied\nDC voltage is same, the relative error of proposed method\nis within 4.58 %, which has higher accuracy than voltage\nintegration method. At the same time, it also meets the\nrequirements of engineering error. 3) When an appropriate\nDC excitation is applied, the magnitude of residual ﬂux den-\nsity in different ranges is accurately calculated by proposed\nempirical formula. But the measurement results have higher\nrequirements for the accuracy of measurement instruments.\nIn addition, the proposed measurement method is applicable\nto transformer cores with different structures which corre-\nspond to different empirical formulas. In the future, we hope\nto analyze different empirical formulas and ﬁnd the con-\nnection between different empirical formulas to solve this\nproblem.\nThis research provides a reference for selecting the direc-\ntion and amplitude of demagnetization voltage in the trans-\nformer core. In the next step study, the proposed measurement\nmethod will be applied to the actual single-phase and three-\nphase power transformer cores to carry out residual ﬂux\ndensity measurement research.\nREFERENCES\n[1] S.
