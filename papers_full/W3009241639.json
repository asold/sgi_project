INTRODUCTION\nThe transformer is a vital element in electrical power systems.\nThe failure of transformer or the wrong operation affects the\noverall power system reliability and performance. The trans-\nformer has its own model. The parameters of the transformer\nmodel depict its performance over different conditions [1].\nThe accurate estimation of the transformer equivalent circuit\nparameters helps in efﬁcient monitoring process of power\ntransformers. The importance of accurate estimation process\nis resulted from the need to enhance the performance char-\nacteristics of transformers in both steady-state and transient\ncases [2], [3]. The existence of harmonics, saturation, and\ntransient conditions in transformer affects the parameter esti-\nmation process. Thus, real time measurements were used\nby applying frequency response [4] or time domain analysis\nto obtain an accurate estimation of the transformer parame-\nters [5]–[8]. The saturation of transformer core was consid-\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Yu-Huei Cheng\n.\nered in parameter estimation by using inrush current measure-\nments [9]. The real time measurement process includes load\nterminal data, phase measurement unit (PMU), inrush current\ntest, open circuit and short- circuit tests. This process, in most\ncases, requires disconnecting the transformer from operation,\nwhich is considered an impractical solution.\nOptimization techniques have become the most popular\nstrategies for solving different electrical problems such as\nthe parameter estimation of electrical elements such as\nelectric machines, transformers, power lines, fuel cells and\nphotovoltaic modules, batteries, management of electrical\ndistribution system with soft open point, optimal power ﬂow\nproblem [10]–[15]...etc. In the estimation problems, the opti-\nmization methods compare the actual and estimated data\nto minimize the deviation between them [16]–[18]. Many\nof optimization methods use the name-plate data as actual\ndata [5], [8]. The equivalent circuit parameters were then\nestimated using evolutionary techniques such as Particle\nSwarm Optimization (PSO) Algorithm, Jaya Optimization\nAlgorithm (JOA) and Genetic Algorithm (GA).

Abdelwaniset al.: Parameter Estimation of Electric Power Transformers Using COA With Experimental Verification\nthe by minimizing the error between the measured power and\nvoltage at different loading conditions and the estimated val-\nues are minimized to obtain the optimal estimated parameters\n[2], [19]–[22].\nChaotic Optimization Algorithm was used the name-plate\nand the load test data to estimate the parameters of sin-\ngle phase transformer in [23]. In [24], Bacterial Foraging\nAlgorithm (BFA) is used to estimate the single- phase and\nthree-phase transformer parameters by applying open and\nshort-circuit experimental tests. Imperialist competitive and\ngravitational search algorithms (GSA) have been proposed\nto estimate the single-phase transformer parameters from\nname-plate data [25], In addition, Artiﬁcial Bee Colony\nAlgorithm was used in [26] to estimate the transformer\nparameters. All of these algorithms can be applied using\nname-plate or load data during the operation of transformer\nwithout having to disconnect the transformer for testing pur-\nposes. Moreover, these algorithms can estimate three-phase\ntransformer parameters as well as those of single-phase trans-\nformer [27], [28] and for optimal design of a three-phase\nhigh-speed ﬂux reversal machine in [29].\nCoyote optimization algorithm (COA) is a new meta-\nheuristic optimization algorithm designed in [30]. The coy-\note’s social organization and exchanging experiences is the\nbase of adaptation (optimization) to the environmental con-\nditions. COA has been classiﬁed as both swarm intelligence\nand evolutionary heuristic. Several applications of COA are\nreported in the literature as for optimizing the estimated\nparameters of fuel cell [31] and for parameter estimation of\nsolar cells [32].\nIn the current study, the COA is developed to estimate the\noptimal parameters of single and three phase transformers.\nThis work has the following main features:\n• This study proposed COA for parameters estimation of\ntransformers;\n• This work is applied to both single- phase and three-\nphase transformers;\n• Parameter estimation of three and single-phase trans-\nformers using the proposed COA is assessed with those\nobtained by JOA and PSO competitive algorithms;\n• The estimation process aims to realize the best voltage\nregulation and efﬁciency by accurate modeling of trans-\nformer equivalent circuit parameters;\n• Experimental tests (open and short circuit tests) are done\non single and three-phase transformer to verify the esti-\nmated parameters.\nII. STEADY STATE CHARACTERISTICS OF TRANSFORMER\nThe steady-state single phase equivalent circuit of the trans-\nformer is shown in Figure 1 [14].\nAppling Kirchhoff voltage and current laws to the per-\nphase transformer equivalent circuit (Figure 1), the following\nrelations can be obtained:\nV\n1 =E1 +I1Z1 (1)\nE1 =V ′\n2 +I′\n2Z\n′\n2 (2)\nFIGURE 1. Per phase equivalent circuit of transformer.\nE1 =IoZma (3)\nI1 =Io +I′\n2 (4)\nFrom the four equations, the primary current I1 and the\nprimary induced voltage E1 can be obtained as follows:\nI1 =V 1 +I′\n2Z\n′\n2\nZ1 +Zm\n(5)\nE1 =V 1 −I1Z1 (6)\nThe referred secondary voltage will be:\nV ′\n2 =E\n1 −I′\n2Z\n′\n2 (7)\nThe core current Io can be obtained as an equivalent value\nto the core magnetizing current component Im and the core\nloss current component Ie+h as follows:\nI\no =E1\nZm\n= E1\nRe+h\n−j E1\nXm\n=Ie+h −jIm (8)\nThe transformer voltage regulation is given as:\nVR =V1 −V ′\n2\nV1\n(9)\nThe primary power factor pf1, input power Pin, and the\noutput power Po can be obtained as follows:\npf1 =cos(angle(I1)) (10)\nPin =real(V1 ×I∗\n1 ) (11)\nPo =real(V ′\n2 ×I\n′∗\n2 ) (12)\nEfﬁciency of the transformer can be calculated from:\nηr =Po\nPin\n(13)\nIt is required to identify the equivalent circuit parameters\nR1, X1, R2, X2, Re+h, Xm accurately as possible. This goal can\nbe achieved through an optimization algorithm.\nIII. PROPOSED COYOTE OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM\nCoyote optimization algorithm (COA) is a new nature-\ninspired metaheuristic algorithm [30]. It is a population-\nbased algorithm, which depends on the social organization\nand conditions of coyotes. COA has been classiﬁed as both\nswarm intelligence and evolutionary heuristic. The objective\nfunction is optimized based on the social organization and\nexchanging experiences among the coyotes. The population\nof coyotes consists of number of packs, NP; each pack\nVOLUME 8, 2020 50037\nM. I. Abdelwaniset al.: Parameter Estimation of Electric Power Transformers Using COA With Experimental Verification\ncontains NC coyote. The total number of coyotes in all\npacks represents the population of the optimization problem.\nThe solution of the optimization problem means the optimal\nadaptation to all social conditions. These social conditions\nof coyotes depict the d- space decision variables of the\noptimization problem.\nThe social condition ’soc’, of the coyote in the pth pack at\ntth instant of time, is socp,t\nc . These conditions of the coyote\nrepresent the decision variables\nX of a speciﬁed global opti-\nmization problem [24]. It is given as:\nsocp,t\nc =X =(x1,x2,......, xd ) (14)\nThe initial social conditions are started randomly for each\ncoyote cth of pth at instant tth and jth dimension in the range\nof the lower and upper bounds, LBj and UBj of the decision\nvariable as follows:\nsocp,t\nc,j =LBj +rj ×(UBj −LBj) (15)\nwhere, rj is a real random number lies in the [0-1] range which\ngenerated using a uniform probability.\nThe objective function is obtained by evaluating the coy-\note’s conditions corresponding to the current decision vari-\nables, as follows:\nﬁt p,t\nc =f (socp,t\nc ) (16)\nThe social organization of coyotes enables it to leave its\npack or join to another one according to the current coyote in\nthe pack, NC (limited to 14 coyote inside the pack). The best\nsolution to the optimization problem at tth instant of time of\nPth pack is ’alpha’ for the global population. It is determined\nas follows:\nalphap,t =\n{\nsocp,t\nc\n⏐⏐argc=(1,2,...,Nc) min f (socp,t\nc )\n}\n(17)\nThe COA enables the sharing of social conditions and\nlinks all information from the global population. COA, then,\ncomputes the cultural tendency of the pack, which is the\nmedian social condition of all coyote from that deﬁned pack.\ncultp,t\nj =\n\n\n\nOp,t\n(Nc+1)\n2 ,j, Nc is odd\nOp,t\nNc\n2 ,j\n+Op,t\n(Nc+1)\n2 ,j\n2 otherwise\n\n\n\n(18)\nwhere Op,t is the ranked decision variables (i.e. social condi-\ntions) of all coyote inside the pth pack at tth instant for every\nj in the space of decision variables, d.\nThe updating of coyote’s new social conditions,\nnew_socp,t\nc depends on two factors; the ﬁrst is the alpha inﬂu-\nence, δ1, and the second is the cultural tendency inﬂuence δ2,\nas follows.\nThe inﬂuence δ1 is taken as the difference from a random\ncoyote (Cr1) inside the pack to the alpha coyote. On the other\nhand, the pack inﬂuence (δ 2) is considered as the difference\nfrom a random coyote (C r2) of a pack to the cultural tendency\nof that pack.\nδ1 =alphap,t −socp,t\ncr1 (19)\nTABLE 1.

The birth\nof a new coyote is represented by a combination of the social\nconditions of two parents inside a pack, which are chosen\nrandomly, as follows:\npupp,t\nj =\n\n\n\nsocp,t\nr1,j, r and j ≤Ps or j =j1\nsocp,t\nr1,j, r and j ≥(Ps +Pa) or j =j2\nRj otherwise\n\n\n\n(24)\nwhere, r1 and r2 are random coyote inside Pth pack. j1 and j2\nrepresent two randomly dimensions of the optimization prob-\nlem.

The value\nof the real random number ran dj lies in the range [0-1], and\ngenerated using uniform probability.\nPs =1/d (25)\nPa =(1 −Ps)/2 (26)\nThe birth and the death of coyotes are syncs as the follow-\ning steps (Algorithm #1):\nStep 1: Compute the group worse adapted to the environment\nthan the pups, ’w’ and the number of coyotes in this\ngroup, ′ϕ′.\n50038 VOLUME 8, 2020\nM.

In this study, COA has 10 packs, each of them contains\n10 coyotes. Thus, the population number is 100 coyotes. The\nmaximum number of iterations is set to 350 and it is con-\nsidered as the stopping criterion of the optimization process.\nJOA and PSO parameters are customized from [33]–[37].\nV. CASE STUDIES\nThe effectiveness of the proposed COA is veriﬁed through\nthe estimation of the parameters of single and three-phase\ntransformers. Theses transformers are described as:\nCase 1: 4 kV A, 380/380 V , 50 Hz, three-phase trans-\nformer: Open circuit, short circuit and DC tests are carried\nout to obtain the actual parameters of the equivalent circuit.\nPhotograph of the experimental implementation is provided\nin Figure 3.\nCase 2: 1 kV A, 230/230 V , 50 Hz, single-phase trans-\nformer, Open circuit, short circuit, DC and load tests are\ncarried out to obtain the actual parameters of the equivalent\ncircuit.\nTable 1 lists the recorded measurements at no load and\nshort circuit tests for single and three-phase transformers.\nIn these cases, the actual data of the transformers have been\nobtained using the open and short-circuited experimental\ntests. The open circuit test is performed at the nominal voltage\nand the measured current and power are used to determine\nFIGURE 7.

In addition, short-circuit test measurements\n(voltage, current and power) are used to determine the pri-\nmary and secondary resistances and leakage reactances i.e.\nR1, X1, R2, X2 respectively.\nThe parameters of both cases are estimated optimally using\nthe COA compared with PSO, Jaya and with those cus-\ntomized from the name-plate and loading data. The obtained\nresults using the competitive algorithms are compared with\nthe actual values, as explained in Tables 2 and 3. The\nestimated parameters are used to calculate the transformer\nVOLUME 8, 2020 50041\nM. I.

In Case 1, the errors obtained\nare 9.753e-10 with PSO, 9.168e-10 with Jaya, and 9.168e-\n10 with COA. In Case 2, it is cleared that COA has the lowest\nerror for estimating the transformer performance. Good con-\nvergences of the three competitive algorithms are illustrated\nin Figs. 4 and 5 for Cases 1 and 2, respectively. It was\nnoticed that PSO converges faster than the others; however,\nCOA has reached the lowest objective function than JOA and\nPSO. Figure 6 shows the performance using the estimated\nparameters of Case 1 compared with those of the actual\ndata. High closeness between estimated efﬁciency and input\npower factor are noticed at different loading percentage to\nthe actual characteristic using COA, then JOA and later PSO.\nHowever, voltage regulation optimized by JOA is the nearest\nto the actual curve. Figure 7 shows the performance data of\nCase 2 compared with the reported name-plate data. Esti-\nmated efﬁciency and voltage regulation using the proposed\nCOA are very close to the actual values. JOA and COA\noutperform in estimating the input Power factor.\nAs the objective function compromise efﬁciency, voltage\nregulation, and input power factor, it can be concluded that\nbest estimation of transformer parameters is obtained. All\nresults show the effectiveness of the proposed competitive\nalgorithms to identify the transformer parameters compared\nwith the actual nameplate data. The proposed COA outper-\nforms the other in performance veriﬁcation.\nTo verify the robustness of the proposed algorithms,\n100 separate runs are applied to COA, JOA and PSO for\nCases 1 and 2. Figure 8 illustrates the robustness of the three\nalgorithms. It is clear that, the proposed COA has the highest\nrobustness, then JOA and later PSO. Table 4 presents the\nstatistical indices of the proposed method at the deﬁned cases.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, the COA optimization algorithm has been pro-\nposed for estimating accurate model parameters of the single\nand three-phase transformers. The estimated parameters of\nthree competitive algorithms i.e. PSO, JOA and COA are used\nto calculate the operating performance of the transformer\nat different loading conditions. The results obtained have\nbeen compared with the recorded experimental results. The\nresults signify the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed\n(COA) in estimating accurate model of the transformers. The\nCOA realizes rapid, smooth, and steady convergence than\nPSO and Jaya. According to the results obtained, the COA\nhas the ability and stability to identify optimal parameters\nand accurate performance of both single and three phase\ntransformers. It can be concluded from all results obtained\nthat COA is more simple, stable, global outperformance\noptimization algorithm in estimating the power transformer\nparameters compared to PSO and JOA.\nREFERENCES\n[1] H.
