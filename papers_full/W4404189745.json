  "abstract": "After the advent of 5th generation (5G) and 6th generation (6G) cellular networks, the complexity of managing real-time signal interference has increased in dense and dynamic environments. Traditional interference techniques, such as frequency reuse and allocation, while effective, lack robust adaptability and transparency needed to reduce interference in advanced communication networks. This paper introduces a novel approach that fuses large language models (LLMs) and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to mitigate interference and enhance interference management in the mathematical foundations of 6G networks. The proposed approach provides accurate interference predictions, which the LLM balances with its complex architecture, necessary to meet the demands of beyond 5G and 6G networks, along with interpretable explanations to ensure transparency in decision-making. The proposed framework has been evaluated across various performance metrics. Interference latency consistently achieves lower rates of 0.95 s, compared to traditional techniques, which average around 1 s. Furthermore, the confidence score of the LLM shows a stable value of 0.87 throughout the system, compared to 0.85 in techniques without LLMs. Overall, the XAI-driven LLM demonstrates the potential of incorporating LLMs and XAI into wireless networks to improve resilience in next-generation networks. This proof of concept introduces a novel framework that offers new dimensions in wireless communication, particularly for interference management, prediction, and mitigation.",
