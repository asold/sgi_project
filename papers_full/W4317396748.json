  "abstract": "Abstract In this paper we investigated SF 6 decomposition behaviour of typical insulation defects in gas‐solid insulated converter transformer valve‐side bushing under partial discharge (PD). Additionally, we compared the results with that of gas insulated switchgear (GIS). The results indicated that SF 6 decomposition behaviour varies with the insulation defects type. For metal protrusion defects, the proportion ranking of CO 2 and SO 2 can be related to whether the needle tip is wrapped with epoxy resin‐impregnated paper (ERIP). The proportion of carbon‐containing products is much higher under contamination defect than under other defects. Moreover, the proportion of carbon‐containing components is higher under flashover condition than under PD condition and is accompanied by the appearance of H 2 S and CS 2 . However, the yield of SO 2 F 2 is always low. Compared to negative DC voltages, positive DC voltages have a higher proportion of carbon‐containing components, mainly in the form of more CO 2 and less SOF 2 . Compared to the PD decomposition behaviour of typical insulation defects in GIS, when PD involves ERIP, the proportion of carbon‐containing products, especially CO 2 , is significant higher, while the proportion of sulphur containing products, especially SO 2 F 2 , is lower.",
