As the tolerances applied in industrial production become more demanding, the role of\nmeasurement uncertainty becomes more important when assessing conformity to these tolerances. Mea-\nsurement uncertainty plays a central role in quality assessment and quality standards. In an eﬀort to\nmeet national, international and commercial accreditation requirements, users of transformer oil testing\nmachines must establish adequate methods of determining calibration and test measurement uncertainties.\nDetermining measurement uncertainty for transformer oil testing equipments and test data can be a very\ncomplex process.

In this\npaper, the concepts associated with the procedure for estimation of uncertainty is discussed and the appli-\ncation of these for the determination of uncertainty in transformer oil testing equipments in government\ntesting labs is illustrated. The objective of this study is to develop a methodology for determining the\nresult of measurement concerning electrical properties of transformer oil and their respective uncertainties.\nKeywords: Resistivity; Tan Delta; transformer oil; accuracy; uncertainty of measurement\n1 Introduction\nIn dealing with the various ﬁrms that perform laboratory\ntesting of transformer oil samples, there are diﬀerent rec-\nommended tests and diﬀerent threshold levels associated\nwith the results. Therefore, i t might be useful to discuss\nwhat is consider to be the more useful tests that need to\nbe performed and the acceptable results associated with\nthose tests. It is highly recommended that transformer oil\nsample tests to be performed at least on an annual ba-\nsis with results compared from year to year. Transformer\noil sample tests can be separ ated into two general cat-\negories, those that assess the immediate acceptability of\nthe insulation system and those that assess the degree of\naging or degradation of the insulation system. Electrical\nproperties of the insulating system change due to age and\ncontinuous electrical stress [1]. The principal contributor\nto the unexpected breakdown of the high voltage equip-\nment is the insulation failure. As compared to the mag-\nnetic, conducting and insulating materials which form the\nbasics of any electrical equipment, the insulating material\nis more prone to service stresses like thermal stress, elec-\ntrical stress, mechanicals stress, environmental stress, etc.\n⋆ Correspondence: nitin\n man@rediﬀmail.com\nBy measuring the electrical properties such as capacitance\nand Tan-Delta regularly on periodical basis, it is possible\nto ensure the operational unexpected breakdown. Dissi-\npation factor (Tan-Delta) is one of the most powerful oﬀ-\nline non destructive diagnostic tools to monitor the condi-\ntion of solid insulation of various high voltage equipment.\nThere are several reasons due to which Tan Delta value\nmay be aﬀected-moisture, dissolving of some of the trans-\nformer varnish, insulating material deteoriating, etc.\n1.1 Description\nThe automatic Tan Delta and resistivity test set has been\nspecially designed to determine the Tan Delta and resistiv-\nity of transformer oil and other electrical insulating liquids\nusing a guarded three terminal test cell. This may also be\nused for measurement of the above parameters of solid\ninsulating materials using a guarded three terminal solid\ntest cell. There are built-in safety features which include\nzero start on voltage adjustment, auto trip with LED in-\ndication if two grounds are not connected; auto trip with\nLED indication if safeties interlock is opened [2,3].\nThe ϵ (epsilon) – DF portion of the instrument oper-\nates as a manually balanced capacitance bridge.

The cell constant (in cm)\nequals 3.6 × π × 1 × C,w h e r eC is the cell capacitance\nin pF. The bridge balance is accomplished with the aid\nof synchronous and phase sensitive null detector which\nallows easy and independent balancing of the ϵ and DF\ncomponents. The ϵ -DF tests are carried out with respect\nto line frequency [2].\nThe resistivity meter is auto ranging with the read-\ning displayed on 3\n1/2 digits DPM. Once the cell constant\nis balanced with the cm dial, the resistivity meter reads\nvolume resistivity directly in ohm-centimeters. With the\ncm dial set to 1000, the resistivity meter reads resistance\nin ohms multiplied by a factor of 1000. The auto ranging\nfeature eliminates the need fo r selecting the right range\nTable 2.Speciﬁcations of Oil Test Cell Heater.\nPower supply 230 V AC ± 10%, 50 Hz or 110 V\n200 VA AC ± 10%, 60 Hz,\nTemperature range 20–110 ◦C\nAccuracy of ±2 ◦C\ntemperature control\nDimension 310 × 190 × 300 mm\nWeight Approx. 12 kg\nmanually.

This uses high frequency induc-\ntion heating which raises the temperature to 90\n◦Ci n\n15 min approximately. A knob and a dial are provided\nto set the temperature at req uired level. A temperature\nsensing probe is supplied and this senses the tempera-\nture and stops heating the oil once the set temperature\nis reached. Two LEDs are provided to indicate ‘heating\non’ and ‘heating oﬀ’. To ensure safety the built-in micro\nswitch interlock automatically trips out the high voltage\nwhen the plexi cover of the heater is raised. Refer Figures2\nand 3.

The Tan Delta test works on\nFig. 3. (Color online) Solid test cell.\nFig. 4. Oil Test Cell.\nthe principle that any insulation in its pure state acts as a\ncapacitor. The test involves applying a very low frequency\nAC voltage. A low frequency causes a higher value of ca-\npacitive reactance which leads to lesser power requirement\nduring the test. Besides, the currents will be limited en-\nabling easier measurement. In a pure capacitor, the cur-\nrent is ahead of the voltage by 90 degrees. The insulation,\nin a pure condition, will behave similarly. However, if the\ninsulation has deteriorated due to the entry of dirt and\nmoisture, the current which ﬂows through the insulation\nwill also have a resistive component. This will cause the\nangle of the current to be less than 90 degrees. This diﬀer-\nence in the angle is known as the loss angle. The tangent\nof the angle which is Ir/Ic (opposite/adjacent) gives us\nan indication of the condition of the insulation. A higher\nvalue for the loss angle indicates a high degree of contam-\nination of the insulation references [2,3]F i g u r e6.\n2 Evaluation of uncertainty\nIn case of transformer oil testing, we have performed num-\nber of test for each parameter. Two types of uncertainties\nare associated with each measuring parameters.\n42 International Journal of Metrology and Quality Engineering\nFig. 5. (Color online) Calibrator.\nFig. 6. Principle of working.\nTo calculate uncertainty following steps are to be fol-\nlowed [4,5]:\nStep 1. Specify measurand, express mathematically the\nequation relating measurand and input quantities.\nIdentify all uncertainty sources.\nStep 2. Determine the input quantities.\nStep 3. Quantify the standard uncertainties of all single\ncomponents.\nStep 4. Identify the covariance (of correlated input quan-\ntities).\nStep 5. Calculate the result of the measurement from the\ninput quantities.\nStep 6. Calculate the co mbined uncertainty.\nStep 7. Calculate the expanded uncertainty.\nStep 8. Give the result together with the uncertainty as\nestimated.\nThe combined uncertainty is given by equation (1).\nU\nc =\n√\nU2\nA + U2\nB1 + U2\nB2 + ... + U2\nBn (1)\nwhere:\nUA = type-A standard uncertainty;\nUB = type-B standard uncertainty.\n2.1 Methodology of selecting factors\nThe factors are selected based on analytical data, calibra-\ntion certiﬁcates, past experie nce and results at interlab\ntesting as below [6,7].\n2.1.1 Repeatability\nIt is included in type-A uncer tainty. It is an analytical\nmethod including the calculation of standard deviation\nand type-A standard uncertainty. Standard deviation in-\ndicates the spread of values which tells us something about\nthe uncertainty of measurement [2].\n2.1.2 Accuracy of reading\nLeast count of scale, slight ﬂuctuations of reading are\nconsidered in type-B uncerta inty. The uncertainty con-\ntributed by this factor aﬀects the ﬁnal result. So their\nconsiderations are must.\nN.K.
