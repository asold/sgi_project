Although anthropic environ-\nments can provide some advantages to animals (e.g., partial food\nprovisioning, low predation risk and increased free time), they\nalso impose new challenges (L\nOWRY et al. 2013, SOL et al. 2013). For\nexample, in anthropic forest fragments, capuchins must adjust\ntheir foraging patterns by exploring new feeding resources (artifi-\ncial or exotic foods) (V\nISALBERGHI & ADDESSI 2003). At the same time,\nthey have to cope with stressful situations, such as crowding, road-\nkill, electrocution, intoxication, and conflicts with humans. Be-\nhavioral flexibility is widely believed to be one of the mechanisms\nby which animals deal with these challenges (S\nOL et al. 2013).\nTool use, an example of flexible behavior found among capuchin\nmonkeys (FRAGASZY et al. 2004), has been documented in some\nurban populations (ROCHA et al. 1998, OTTONI & MANNU 2001).\nHabitual tool use by wild capuchins has been increasingly\ndocumented in the last decade (O TTONI & I ZAR 2008). Most ac-\ncounts concern Sapajus libidinosus Spix, 1823, a species that in-\nhabits savannah-like environments in Brazil, and describe the\nuse of tools for food extraction (sensu B ENTLEY-CONDIT & S MITH\n2010), for instance stones for digging tubers, and pounding tools\nfor cracking open encapsulated fruits (MOURA & LEE 2004, MANNU\n& OTTONI 2009, DE MORAES et al. 2014). In addition, the tool-kit\nused by S. libidinosus comprises tools of other categories, such as\nutensils to transport resources, including probes (MANNU & OTTONI\n2009), and for communication (F ALÓTICO & O TTONI 2013). The\nuse of probes was also observed in a group of blond capuchin\nmonkeys (Sapajus flavius Schreber, 1774) inhabiting a forest frag-\nment in the Atlantic Forest Domain (S\nOUTO et al. 2011).\nThe differences observed among tool-kits of capuchins\nfrom different populations illustrate their flexibility in tool use.\nAlthough genetic and ecological factors may contribute to the\ndevelopment of tool use behavior (M EULMAN et al. 2013), the\nsocial environment appears to provide a basis for naive capu-\nchins to learn technical skills (F RAGASZY et al. 2013).\nHere we report the use of tools by capuchins from two\nurban populations in geographically distant locations in Bra-\nzil, with two different purposes: first, to pound seeds with a\nwooden hammer and anvil and second, to obtain water inside\ntree trunk holes using different kinds of sponges.

Capuchin monkeys, Sapajus Kerr, 1792, are known for their flexible behavior, including tool use, and their\nability to survive in urban forests. We observed capuchin juveniles using wood as hammer and anvil and different\nmaterials as sponges (four tool-use events) in two geographically distinct urban populations in Brazil, in 2012: two in\nGoiânia, Central Brazil and two in Foz do Iguaçu, Southern Brazil. In Goiânia, a male used a detached tree branch as a\nhammer and a buttress root as an anvil to pound a seed of Terminalia Linnaeus. Another male used a small branch with\nleaves as a dipping tool to access water inside a tree trunk hole. In Foz do Iguaçu, the capuchins used a small branch\nand a piece of bread to obtain water by dipping them into tree trunk holes. This latter event might be interpreted as a\ncase of self-control, with a familiar food item used as a tool to reach a resource that is difficult to access otherwise. Our\nobservations contribute to the knowledge on the tool-kit of capuchins and we propose that these urban populations\nshould be conserved for scientific evaluations of behavioral flexibility in non-human primates.\nKEY WORDS. Animal self-control; behavioral flexibility; food provisioning; urban wildlife; values of nature conservancy.\n517Tool use in urban populations of capuchin monkeys Sapajus spp.\nZOOLOGIA 31 (5): 516–519, October, 2014\ndipping tools to obtain water from cavities in trees is rare in\nprimates (T ONOOKA 2001). Our observations may also indicate\na case of animal self-control in a non-captive context, namely\nthe abdication of an immediate opportunity to consume re-\nsources in favor of using a tool to later obtain other valuable\nresources (E\nVANS & W ESTERGAARD 2006). To date such behavior\nhad only been observed in captive capuchins (E VANS  &\nWESTERGAARD 2006, JUDGE & ESSLER 2013).\nOur observations took place in two urban parks in Brazil:\nAreião Municipal Park (16°42’18.4\"S, 49°15’16.1\"W), 14 ha large,\nin the city of Goiânia (Central Brazil, Cerrado Domain) and the\nJardim Ipê Forest (25°28’56.1\"S, 54°33’55.9\"W), 3.5 ha large, in\nthe city of Foz do Iguaçu (Southern Brazil, Atlantic Forest Do-\nmain). In both areas, capuchins are semi-free ranging and are\nprovisioned weekly, although they can also forage for resources\nin the forest and consume human leftovers. Both areas are open\nto the public and humans frequently feed the capuchins. Con-\ntrasting with the Foz do Iguaçu Park, where water is more lim-\nited, water sources are continuously available in the Goiânia Park\n(a stream and a lake). Stones that are large and hard enough to\nbe used as hammers and anvils are unavailable in both locations.\nA native population of S. libidinosus has been living in the\nGoiânia Park at least since 1938, when the reserve was created.\nToday, this population consists of three groups. There have been\nlocal accounts of these monkeys using probes, which we aimed\nto ascertain. Capuchins from different groups were observed from\nAugust to November 2012, three days a week, at different hours\n(8:00-11:00 or 13:00-16:00 h) of the day, adding up to a total of\n126 h in 52 days. Tool use was observed in two distinct groups:\none of 24 individuals [13 adults (five males and eight females),\ntwo subadults, four juveniles and one infant], and another of\n34 individuals [13 adults (three males and 10 females), four su-\nbadults, eight juveniles and one infant)].\nIn Foz do Iguaçu, tool-use events were registered during\na social behavior study of a group of 17 individuals (J.P. Back,\nunpubl. data) that inhabit the forest [six adults (one male and\nfive females), three subadults, three juveniles and five infants].\nAlthough Sapajus nigritus (Goldfuss, 1809) occurs naturally in\nthis region, the coats of individuals in this group are blond\nand they rather resemble Sapajus cay (Illiger, 1815). Therefore,\nthey are here referred to as Sapajus sp. (L\nYNCH-ALFARO et al. 2014).\nAccording to local people, these capuchins have lived there\nfor 30 years, and are most likely introduced. The group was\nobserved for three days each month between 7:00 and 17:00 h\nfrom January 2012 to June 2013 for a total of 530 hours.\nWe followed the definition of tool use by S\nHUMAKER et al.\n(2011). We considered as a tool-use event the usage of an ob-\nject to obtain a resource until the abandonment of that object.\nThese events were counted using the all-occurrences sampling\nmethod (A\nLTMANN 1974), and were recorded and described ad\nlibitum in a field notebook.\nWe observed four tool-use events: two events in Goiânia\n(1.6 event/100 h) and two in Foz do Iguaçu (0.4 event/100 h).\nAll tool-use events were observed in 2012 and were performed\nby juveniles. In all cases, no other individual was within five\nmeters of the subject.\nThe first event was recorded in Goiânia (September 7 th,\nat 9:47 h): a male juvenile on the ground used a detached tree\nbranch as a hammer and a buttress root as an anvil to pound\nan encapsulated seed of Terminalia L. (Fig. 1). One of us (E.C.\nCarneiro) became aware of this behavior when it was already\nbeing performed, and for this reason we did not record its du-\nration. We were also unable to verify whether the use of this\ntool was successful because the animal abandoned the site car-\nrying the seed. The second event (September 12\nth, 14:58-15:00\nh), also in Goiânia, took place in the canopy, ten meters above\nground: another male detached a small branch with leaves from\na tree of an undetermined species and dipped it into a tree\ntrunk hole (Fig. 2). The capuchin left the branch inside the\nhole for three seconds and then kneaded the leaves with two\nhands and sucked them. Subsequently, it moved one meter\naway and discarded the branch.\nIn Foz do Iguaçu, we observed the use of two different\ntools for dipping into tree trunk holes of the forest understory\n(approximately two meters above ground): 1) a small piece of\nbread provided by humans (January 7\nth, 14:45-14:51 h) and 2)\na small branch with leaves picked up from the ground (Sep-\ntember 6\nth, 16:21-16:22 h). During both events, the animal\nsucked the object repeatedly after multiple insertions into the\ncavities. During the first event, the capuchin ate the bread af-\nter dipping it and sucking from it five times. During the sec-\nond event, the capuchin left the branch after drinking from it\nthree times. It was not possible to identify the juveniles in Foz\ndo Iguaçu, and therefore they may have been performed by\nthe same individual or not.\nTool use was a rare behavior at our study sites compared\nwith other sites (e.g., P\nHILLIPS 1998, MANNU & OTTONI 2009), but\nwe observed differences in tool-use behavior in both areas. In\nGoiânia, tool use can be split into two categories: food extrac-\ntion and resource transportation (here: water). In Foz do Iguaçu,\nwe only observed one of those categories, resource transport,\nbut two different techniques were employed: the use of a natu-\nral item from the forest (branch) and of a man-made food item\n(bread). This may indicate a temporary transition of a familiar\nfood item into a dipping tool, as discussed below.\nCapuchins can maintain the use of tools through social\nlearning, and adult individuals tend to be more skilled users\n(O\nTTONI et al. 2005). However, we only observed tool use by juve-\nniles at our observation sites, and adults were not involved. The\nobserved categories of tool use are common among capuchin\njuveniles (PHILLIPS 1998, MANNU & O TTONI 2009) and have been\nassociated with their great learning capacity, propensity for in-\nnovation and flexible behavior (KUMMER & GOODALL 1985). LOWRY\net al. (2013) noted that juveniles can express a greater foraging\nplasticity in urban environments, and tool use can be consid-\nered as a foraging strategy (BENTLEY-CONDIT & SMITH 2010).\n518 L.M. Aguiar et al.\nZOOLOGIA 31 (5): 516–519, October, 2014\nIn Goiânia, a capuchin used a hammer and anvil in a feed-\ning context. According to F RAGASZY et al. (2013) these are com-\nplex tools for animals and require practice. Young capuchins can\ncombine non-stone items for pounding (M\nANNU & OTTONI 2009),\nas observed by us where stones are not available. Thus, the use of\nwooden hammer and anvil suggests a pounding technology\nanalogous to the more common lithic tools observed at other\nsites, since the basic principles of tool use can be applied to both\norganic and inorganic materials (W\nESTERGAARD & SUOMI 1994).\nThe urban capuchins used dipping tools as sponges but\nin a simpler fashion than other capuchin populations, which\nperform object modifications (P HILLIPS 1998, M ANNU & O TTONI\n2009). The use of bread as a tool by a capuchin was noteworthy\nand the bread was only consumed after repeatedly using it as a\nsponge for drinking water, suggesting that the user is capable of\nself-control (EVANS & WESTERGAARD 2006). Apparently, the capu-\nchin was able to postpone the immediate consumption of a food\nitem to access water, which is a scarce and valuable resource in\nthis urban forest. The use of food as a tool, including bread, has\nbeen recorded for captive capuchins (M\nCGREW & MARCHANT 1997),\nand our observations indicate that capuchins in a non-captive\ncontext share this ability. Alternatively (but not to the exclu-\nsion of the first explanation), it is possible that the capuchin\nmeant to soften the bread instead of using it as a tool. However,\nthe action pattern and the repetition of combined insertion and\ndrinking indicate that the bread was used as a tool.\nOur observations were made on semi-free ranging and\npartially provisioned monkeys, a situation that can interfere\nwith the foraging behavior of the species (L\nOWRY et al. 2013).\nHowever, it is difficult to evaluate these influences on the ur-\nban capuchins from Goiânia because wild populations of S.\nlibidinosus frequently use tools. Yet, the continuous availabil-\nity of food and water suggests that these animals live with a\nsurplus of time and energy, and that the observed tool use be-\nhavior could result from the opportunistic habits of the spe-\ncies (H ASLAM 2013). Anthropic food are abundantly available\nto the capuchins in Foz do Iguaçu, while water sources are\nscarce, which could explain the self-control and opportunistic\nhabit of using a common food item as a tool.\nFinally, tool use behavior is absent in the majority of\nother species of Sapajus, especially in forested environments\n(O\nTTONI & IZAR 2008). There are only four sites in the Atlantic\nForest Domain where capuchins were observed using tools (this\nstudy, R OCHA et al . 1998, O TTONI & M ANNU 2001, S OUTO et al .\n2011), three of which are urban forests. Monkeys in urban for-\nests are often more accessible for primatological field studies\nand urban populations of tool using capuchins can be viewed\nas scientific subjects for accessible studies of primate behavior.\nIn addition to surveying tool-use techniques by capuchin popu-\nlations, we encourage environmental administrators, manag-\ners and scientists to use the so-called Ecologistic-Scientific\nHuman Value of Nature (K\nELLERT 1993) as a motivation to bet-\nter protect these animals in cities.\nOur observations contribute to the knowledge on the\ntool-kit of capuchins and we propose that these urban popula-\ntions should be subjected to scientific evaluations. Standard-\nized field studies will help to catalog, compare and contextualize\nthe social and ecological significance of the tool-kit of these\nurban monkeys, while providing a better understanding of\nanimal behavioral flexibility and interactions with humans.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nLMA, JPB and AS are grateful to the PROBIC/UNILA,\nFundação Araucária, and Foz do Iguaçu City Hall.
