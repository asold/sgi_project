  "abstract": "Background Predicting hospitalization from nurse triage notes has the potential to augment care. However, there needs to be careful considerations for which models to choose for this goal. Specifically, health systems will have varying degrees of computational infrastructure available and budget constraints. Objective To this end, we compared the performance of the deep learning, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)–based model, Bio-Clinical-BERT, with a bag-of-words (BOW) logistic regression (LR) model incorporating term frequency–inverse document frequency (TF-IDF). These choices represent different levels of computational requirements. Methods A retrospective analysis was conducted using data from 1,391,988 patients who visited emergency departments in the Mount Sinai Health System spanning from 2017 to 2022. The models were trained on 4 hospitals’ data and externally validated on a fifth hospital’s data. Results The Bio-Clinical-BERT model achieved higher areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.82, 0.84, and 0.85) compared to the BOW-LR-TF-IDF model (0.81, 0.83, and 0.84) across training sets of 10,000; 100,000; and ~1,000,000 patients, respectively. Notably, both models proved effective at using triage notes for prediction, despite the modest performance gap. Conclusions Our findings suggest that simpler machine learning models such as BOW-LR-TF-IDF could serve adequately in resource-limited settings. Given the potential implications for patient care and hospital resource management, further exploration of alternative models and techniques is warranted to enhance predictive performance in this critical domain.
