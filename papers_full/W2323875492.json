    "abstract": "The Power transformers are one of the most vital as well as expensive equipment in an electric power system.Therefore, it is the responsibility of utilities to decrease the transformer lifecycle costs and to increase the usable service time.The damage may cause a change in the physical condition of transformer which would be reflected in the electrical parameters-resistance, inductance and capacitance.The insulation performance is influenced by thermal, electrical and mechanical stresses.The displacement of windings can occur during transportation of transformers or during a short circuit near the transformer in the power system.The Frequency Response Analysis (FRA) can detect the type of fault and the exact location of fault.The result obtained for the various fault condition is compared with the reference set and the conclusion are drawn.",
