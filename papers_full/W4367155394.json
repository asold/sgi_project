The article proposes a theoretically based a pproach to determining the service areas and \nlocation of transformer substations (TS) in the cas e depending on the intensity of the electric load \nbased on the area specified in the city power s upply system. Rati onal use of service areas and \ndetermination of the optimal area by location will help regulate the city's power supply. As a result \nof the scientific approach in the article, the targ eted use of a transformer substation in the municipal \npower supply system will achieve orderly development in the city, as well as a reduction in the \nwaste of electricity in distribution power networks. \n1 Introduction \nCurrently, all elements of the power supply system of \nexisting cities are components of the regional or state \nenergy system. Such systems have multiple voltage \nstandards scale level networks and are constantly \nevolving. In this case, it is important to make a decision \non the basis of a timely scientific approach to \ndetermining the transformer substations and their service \nareas and location, which are the main element of the \ncity power supply system. Each city power supply \nsystem has a certain hierar chy of voltages. In the \nsubstations of the municipal power supply system, as a \nrule, 220/35, 110/35, 110/10, 35/10, 10/0,4 kV \ntransformers of the voltage level are used. \n2 Voltage and electric load density \ngradation in the city electric networks \nIn city power supply, the tota l electric load is formed by \nthe electricity of existin g consumer groups. These \ngenerated electrical loads should be provided \nuninterrupted by transformer substations within the city \npower supply system. The optimal power of transformers \nin substations, which depends on the different voltage \nlevel in the urban area, depends on the electrical load \ndensity of the area. The elect rical load density in the \nindividual areas of the city obtained differs from the \naverage load density in the city. The value of the electric \nload density depends on the specifics of the territorial \nconstruction, the number of floors of the premises \nlocated, the degree of electrifi cation and the value of the \nvoltage in the connection of consumers to TP. The \nelectrical load density at each voltage level is determined \nby the total load at the previous network level of \nconsumers and the additional load at the level under \nconsideration. As a result, th e electrical load density in \nhierarchy transition networks corresponding to electrical \nnetwork voltages is determined by networks as follows \n[1, 10-15, 18-23, 9]: \n \n𝜎଴ ൌ\nௌ∑బ,ర\nி೎೔೟೤\n                            (1) \n𝜎ଵ ൌ\nௌ∑భబషయఱ\nி೎೔೟೤\n                          (2) \n𝜎ଶ ൌ\nௌ∑యఱషభభబ\nி೎೔೟೤\n                         (3) \n𝜎ଷ ൌ\nௌ∑భభబషమమబ\nி೎೔೟೤\n                       (4) \n \nwhere, S∑0,4 – power load of consumers on the \ntransformer substation 0.4 kV voltage tire, σ0 – electrical \nload density; \nS∑10-35 – power load of consumers on a transformer \nsubstation 10 or 35 kV voltage tire, σ1 – electrical load \ndensity; \nS∑35-110 – power load of consumers on a transformer \nsubstation 35 or 110 kV voltage tire, σ2 – electrical load \ndensity; \nS∑110-220 – electrical load of consumers on a \ntransformer substation 110 or 220 kV voltage tire, σ3 – \nelectrical load density. \nThe voltage by voltage rating of all transformer \nsubstations providing the city area depends on the \ndescription of consumers of electricity of individual \npower at each stage. Electricity consumers are \nconsidered one or three phase in terms of reliability and \nrated power, voltage of the power supply. On the \nterritory of the city, a voltage  of 220 kV is used, mainly \nin electrical networks coming from the power plant, if \nwe see the example of the city of Tashkent. By the \nsequence stage, it is divided into electrical networks with \na voltage of 110, 35, 10, 0.4 kV. On the territory of \nUzbekistan, networks with a voltage of 330, 20, 6 kV are \nnot used for city power supply.

Voltage and electric load density gradation in the city \nelectric networks. \n \nFrom the above expressions 1, 2, 3, 4 it follows that \nthe actual electric load de nsity at each voltage level \nvaries due to different regions and factors \nsimultaneously influencing the maximum electrical load \nof transformers in TS [5, 16-24]. \nIf the electrical loads generated by consumers and the \narea of the city (or part of it) allocated for the building \nare known, the average electrical load density at the total \nvoltage level in this city (or part of it) is determined as \nfollows: \n \n𝜎௜. ൌ\nௌ೎೔೟೤\nி೎೔೟೤\n                            (5) \n \nwhere, σi. – i - average electrical load density for a \nvoltage level electrical network, [MVA/km2]; \nScity – the total electrical lo ad of city electrical \nnetworks (or part of it) at a certain voltage level in the \ncity power supply system, [MVA]; \nFcity – city area (or part of it) allocated for the \nconstruction of a residential or public building, [km2]. \nIn the general case, the total electrical load of the city \n(or part) at a certain voltage level of the municipal power \nsupply system is determined as follows: \n𝑆௖௜௧௬ ൌ𝑘 ்ௌ.௜ ∙∑ 𝑆்ௌ.௜\n௡೅ೄ\n௜ୀଵ ൌ𝑘 ்ௌ.௜ ∙∑ 𝑛௜ ∙𝛽௜ ∙௡೅ೄ\n௜ୀଵ 𝑆௡௢௠.௜    (6) \n \nwhere, STS.i. – i - electrical load of transformer \nsubstation, [MVA]; \nkTS.i – coefficient taking into account the \nsimultaneous maximum load of transformers depending \non the number of TS in the network at a given suitable \nvoltage level; \nni – number of transformers in substation; \nβi – load coefficient of the i - transformer in the \nsubstation; \nSnom.i – i - rated power of substation transformers, \n[MVA];  \nnTS – number of transformer substations in an urban \narea (or part thereof). \n3 Determination of the service area of \ntransformer substation \nThe service area and time of transformer substations \nlocated on the territory of the city power supply system \ndepend on the type of consumers located in the area, the \nfloor of the premises, the lo cation of the electrical load \ndepends on the geometric description. On the territory of \nthe city, electricity consumers form an electric load in a \nvertical position. Taking into  account this, the issue of \ndetermining the service area by the geometric location of \nthe transformer substation is considered relevant. \nDetermining the geometric area in the optimal position \nhas a great influence on the development of urban \nplanning and city power supply. By determining the \nlimit optimal area of the transformer substation, it is \npossible to achieve a reduction in the length of low \nvoltage electrical networks, as well as a reduction in the \ncost of waste electricity [6-10]. \nTo provide qualitative electri city supply for all the \nconsumers of a city they are to be rationally distributed \namong separate transformer substations according to \ntheir service area.  The service area of each separate \nsubstation is defined by the load density in this area and \nthe TS load, which, in turn, depends on the rated power \nof a corresponding transformer, the number of \ntransformers at the substation and the load factor: \n \n𝐹௖௜௧௬ ൌ\nௌ೅ೄ.೔\nఙ೅ೄ.೔\nൌ\n௡೔∙ఉ೔∙ௌ೙೚೘.೔\nఙ೅ೄ.೔\n                           (7)  \n \nwhere, σTS.i - is the load density in the service area of \nthe i - substation. \nIn the absence of a technical solution or a single \napproach to the design and modelling of the elements of \nan city power supply system, it can have complex \ngeometric shapes or sche mes that differ for each \nsubstation by area. This makes it difficult to choose a \nplace for new substations a nd purposefully develop a \npower supply scheme. Therefore, by the rules of city \nplanning regulations, it is not allowed to connect \nadditional loads to the city area or build a substation. \nWhen determining the service area of the transformer \nsubstation can be designed and modeled with geometric \nshapes. For example, in geometry there are circle, \nsquare, regular six, eight corners, etc. The most \nconvenient model is the hexagon. This makes it possible \nto cover almost any shaped  area of the building in a \nregular order. This model of the transformer substation \nservice sector can be selected  as the only template in the \ndesign work. Design and modelling in such a way is \nconsidered useful in making decisions on the \ndevelopment of urban distribution electrical networks. It \nis conditionally accepted that the transformer substation \nshould be in the center of the hexagon (in the practical \nE3S Web of Conferences 384, 01033 (2023) https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202338401033\nRSES 2022\n2\ncase, the area should not fall beyond the boundaries of \nthe hexagon). \nFigures 2, 3 describe the template in the sample case \nfor the service area of various rated voltage transformer \nsubstations to be placed in the city area, as well as the \ndesignable ideal view of the service.

In  this case, the center of \nconditional loads can be moved to a point close to \nconsumers with a large capacity [11-16, 20, 22, 24]. \nLet's explain using an example for a small area on \ndetermining the optimal location coordinate of TS in the \ncity power supply system.

For the rational placement \nof TS in the territory of the city power supply, models \nand templates were developed based on various \ngeometric shapes. The dependence of TS service areas \nand their radii on the electrical load density in the service \nsector for TS with two transformers 220/35-110 kV, \n110/10-35, 35/10 and 10/0,4 kV was determined. Based \non the consumer power and location coordinates of the \nconsumers received by the territory, the theoretical \nconcepts of the location of the TS and the placement of \npower supply lines were reasonably explained using a \npractical example. This method, developed, will be able \nE3S Web of Conferences 384, 01033 (2023) https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202338401033\nRSES 2022\n4\nto reduce the waste of resour ces and electricity in city \nelectricity supply and will have  a positive effect on the \ndevelopment and expansion trend of cities. \nReferences \n1.
