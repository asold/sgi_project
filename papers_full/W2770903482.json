  "abstract": "This paper presents a high-frequency modular medium-voltage AC (4160 VAC or 13.8 kVAC) to low-voltage DC (400 VDC) system that is scalable in order to be used for different scale microgrids. A 15 kW, 500 kHz DC/DC converter is demonstrated as the most important stage of the system overall, which can be scalable to a 225 kW 4160 VAC to 400 VDC system. Motivation of a CLLC resonant converter and its design parameters determination is carefully illustrated. The high-frequency transformer is the key element for the DC/DC converter. Then, the paper focuses on high-frequency transformer design to realize high-voltage insulation, high efficiency, and high density at the same time. Based on a split winding UU core transformer structure, transformer insulation materials and dimension parameters are determined referring to the IEEE insulation standard. The transformer magnetic loss model is reviewed based on which loss design tradeoff is carefully analyzed. Different working frequency impact on transformer design over three different core materials is also presented. Finally, a 500 kHz transformer prototype has been developed and demonstrated with the IEEE standard required insulation tests. A whole CLLC resonant converter is also present with experiments results. Here, the converter holds outstanding 98% efficiency and 2.9 kW/L power density.",
