    "abstract": "Power electronics is continuously evolving toward higher power densities. Consequently, volume, weight, and material reduction are becoming major design issues, which lead the research focus toward high/medium-frequency power conversion systems. This paper presents a direct and simple design methodology aimed at reaching the best medium-frequency power transformer solution for a given application. Besides maximum power loss or minimum volume requirements, the value of the leakage inductance is adjusted within the design methodology, essential for proper operation of most medium-frequency conversion systems. The proposed design methodology has been applied and experimentally verified on a small scale prototype.",
