Among the gases, acetylene, as a symbol of low energy spark discharge and high energy \nelectrical faults (arc discharge) of power transformer, is an important monitoring parameter.

In this paper, an optical gas detection system \nbased on TDLAS technology is proposed to detect acetylene dissolved in transformer oil. We selected \na 1530.370 nm laser in the near infrared wavelength range to correspond to the absorption peak of \nacetylene, while using the wavelength modulation strategy and Herriott cell to improve the detection \nprecision. Results show that the limit of detection reaches 0.49 ppm. The detection system responds \nquickly to changes of gas concentration and is easily to maintenance while has no electromagnetic \ninterference, cross-sensitivity, or carrier gas. In addition, a complete detection process of the system \ntakes only 8 minutes, implying a practical prospect of online monitoring technology.\nPower transformers are important equipment in the power system, and the stable operation of the transformer \nis essential for power transmission. In order to prevent the transformer outage due to failure, it is important to \nmonitoring the condition of the transformer\n1,2.\nWhen specific defects such as overheating, partial discharge, or arc discharge occurs in the transformer, the insu-\nlation oil or paper decomposes and produces gases, and the gases are dissolved in insulating oil3–6. Then, the decom-\nposition products in the oil reduce the insulation properties and change the interfacial tensor3. Thus, aging or defect \ninformation can be obtained by analyzing the volume, types, proportions, and rate of production of dissolved gases7,8.\nThe detection of dissolved gases in liquids has many important applications in different industries, such as \nwater quality assessment (oxygen concentration in water), carbon dioxide concentration in carbonated beverages, \nand methane detection in crude oil. Besides that, dissolved gas analysis and detection in transformer oil is a useful \nmethod for evaluating the transformer condition\n9–11.\nDissolved gas analysis (DGA) is an oil-immersed transformer fault prediction and detection technique, based \non the measurement of dissolved gases12. And there are some methods to detect fault gases, such as: gas chroma-\ntography (GC)13, thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and optical methods such as: spectral absorption method, \nphotoacoustic spectroscopy14,15. However, these methods have following drawbacks:\n 1) GC is a widely used technique for quantitatively measuring fault gases concentration. Nevertheless, this \nanalytical technique is not effective for on-line monitoring due to its large size, unstable in field and reli-\nance on carrier gas and columns. After that, the chromatography analysis takes much time\n16. In addition, \nphysical or chemical detectors are susceptible to cross-sensitivity, while electromagnetic interference and \nreliability also affect detection accuracy\n17.\n 2) The mechanical vibration and noise signals in the substation seriously affect the normal photoacoustic \ndetection.\n1State Key Laboratory of Alternate Electrical Power System with Renewable Energy Sources, North China \nElectric Power University, Beijing, 102206, P .

Thus, any noise introduced by the light source or system reduce the detecta-\nbility of the technology. Therefore, the sensitivity should be improved for field application.\n 4) Laser calorimetry spectroscopy (LCS), an in-liquid detection technique, will be a promising technology if \nit can achieve a lower detection limit, but at present, the minimum detection limit for acetylene in trans-\nformer oil is 10 ppm\n18 which does not meet the requirement of DGA.\nThe direct absorption spectroscopy can be improved in two aspects; to reduce the noise in the signal and to \nincrease the absorption. And modulation techniques can reduce noise. Acetylene is produced in low energy spark \ndischarge and high energy electrical faults (arc discharge). And acetylene detection is of great importance to mon-\nitor the incipient faults. Both Ding et al. and He et al. use tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) \ntechnology to detect acetylene gas, but their limit of detection do not meet the requirements for transformer \ncondition monitoring\n19,20. Moreover, their experiments lack the discussion of the precision of the test. Thus, there \nis still a gap from the practical application. Deng et al. used Herriott cell to increase the optical path and detect \nacetylene gas, but these achievements are made in the gas conditions, unsuitable for transformer oil dissolved gas \ndetection\n21.\nThere are some problems need to be solved if we want to use TDLAS technology and Herriott cell for gas \ndetection in transformer oil. For example, if the output laser is directly irradiated in the transformer oil, most \nof the light intensity will be absorbed by the oil, so the gas cannot be detected. If we increase the optical path to \nimprove the absorption of gas, according to our test results, when the oil sample thickness of 4 cm, only 52.3% \nof the light intensity through the oil sample, for wavelength of 1557 nm. To solve the problems, a new method is \nproposed in the paper.\nHerriott cell cannot be directly used in oil immersion conditions, since the insulating oil pollutes the mirrors \nin Herriott cell. Thus, we designed a separation device, using the vacuum degassing method to determine the \ndegassing efficiency, and carried out the calibration test. In the manuscript, the results of the calibration test \nshow that TDLAS technology and Herriott cell can be used to detect dissolved gases in the oil using our designed \nequipment.\nIn our case, we modulate the output wavelength of the laser. Near infrared DFB lasers are used in manuscript, \nfor it has an economical advantage over mid-infrared lasers. And the detection sensitivity of the proposed meas-\nuring system is also satisfied. The experimental device designed in the manuscript uses Herriott cell and wave-\nlength modulation to improve the monitoring sensitivity, and to meet the requirements of online testing.\nTheory of TDLAS technology\nWhen a beam of light passes through an absorption cell with a certain concentration of gas, the light intensity will \nbe attenuated to some extent. This phenomenon reflects the change in gas concentration, and the gas concentra-\ntion can be determined by measuring the intensity attenuation, which is called Beer-Lambert’s law.\nBeer-Lambert Law can be expressed as:\nα=× −× ×Iv v() Ie xp[( )C L] (1)0\nwhere I (v) and I0 (v) are intensities of incident and emitted laser respectively, V . C is the concentration of gas to \nbe detected, ppm. L is the path length of the beam of light through the material sample, m. α(v) is the absorption \ncoefficient per unit distance and per unit concentration of the gas, cm/mol. A is absorbance.\nα=− =× ×Iv vvAl n( () /I () )( )C L (2)0\nα=× ×d\ndv\ndv\ndv\nA( ) CL (3)\nn\nn\nn\nn\nThe derivative of A shows a linear relationship between the amplitude and the concentration C as other con-\nditions do not change. When n = 2, the 2 f signal is\nα=× ×d\ndv\ndv\ndv\nA () CL\n2\n2\n2\n2\nThe different order derivatives of A are shown in Fig. 1.\nAccording to HITRAN database, acetylene has 5560 absorption lines in the near infrared band \n(780 nm ~ 2526 nm. When it comes to absorption lines, the high absorption intensity and the avoidance of inter-\nference are the main concerns. For these considerations, we chose the “P9 peak” of acetylene (1530.370 nm) as \nthe central wavelength of the DFB laser. The molecule absorption intensity distribution of acetylene is shown in \nFig. 2, available from website http://hitran.org/.\nTDLAS uses a laser with a line width much smaller than the gas absorption line width, and a single absorp-\ntion line of the gas is scanned by wavelength modulation 22,23. Then, we can obtain the harmonic component of \nthe absorption signal through the lock-in amplifier, and the concentration of the test gas is proportional to the \namplitude of the harmonic signal.\nThe coefficient of the odd harmonic component is zero at the center wavelength and the even harmonic is the \nmaximum. Since the amplitude of the harmonic signal decreases with increasing order, we choose the second \nharmonic as the actual detection signal. As a calibration experiment is carried out to determine the relationship \nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n3\nScientific  RepoRts  | 7: 14961  | DOI:10.1038/s41598-017-13823-0\nbetween the gas concentration and the second harmonic signal amplitude, we can measure the harmonic signal \nto obtain gas concentration in field application24.\nExperimental setup\nThe test platform is mainly composed of oil chamber, gas detection system and vacuum device. Among them, the \noil chamber is designed to complete the oil and gas separation. The gas to be measured then passed into the air \nchamber and the acetylene concentration information is detected by the TDLAS controller and the acquisition \nsystem. The vacuum pump is used to make the vacuum of the gas detection system and to remove the impurity \ngas (including the last test residual gas).\nGas preparation method is as follows: Use a syringe to take 40 mL of oil, inject 5 mL of acetylene gas and seal \nit. Place the syringes on a vibrating and heating platform for oil-gas mixing. The heating temperature is set to be \n50 degrees Celsius while the vibration lasts half hour. Take a few drops from the syringes to the beaker, then add \ndifferent volume pure transformer oil to obtain the different concentrations test oil samples.\nSeven groups of different concentrations of oil were prepared in the test, about 500 mL in each group, of which \n300 mL was used for oil-gas separation and TDLAS testing, and 40 mL was used for gas chromatography. The gas \ndetection system uses a multi-pass Herriott cell, which has the advantages of small size (34 cm), long optical path \nlength (10.1 m), strong absorbance and high sensitivity. The experimental setup is shown in Fig. 3. The photode-\ntector used by measuring system was encapsulated in metal shield, which has good electromagnetic compatibility.\nFigure 1. The different order derivatives of absorbance line shape. The 2f signal shape is drawn as a yellow line.\nFigure 2. Acetylene gas molecule absorption intensity distribution in the range of 1530.34 ~ 1530.38 nm (from \nHITRAN2012 database). Absorption intensity is also referred as line strength, and the unit is cm–1/(molecule/\ncm2) in HITRAN database.\nFigure 3. Experimental setup of TDLAS measurement. The oil chamber in the experimental setup is used for \noil-gas separation. Herriott cell is used to increase the optical path. Control and measurement system is used to \nwavelength modulation and data measurement.\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n4\nScientific  RepoRts  | 7: 14961  | DOI:10.1038/s41598-017-13823-0\nThe test process involves two types of oil samples: pure oil and dissolved acetylene oil. The test should be in \naccordance with the following steps:\n•\t Test sequence: pure oil → dissolved acetylene oil (from low to high concentration).\n•\t Ensure the oil chamber and air chamber air tightness.\n•\t When the transformer oil enters and avoid polluting the air chamber, slowly open the exhaust valve within \n1 minute.\n•\t Before vacuum extraction, oil sample is prepared for offline DGA test in the lab for 3 times and the average \nvalue is recorded.\nThe main procedure of TDLAS detection includes oil sample preparation, vacuum extraction, oil injection, \noil and gas separation, acetylene detection and data recording and processing, as shown in Fig. 4. Detection pro-\ncess does not require carrier gas. After oil and gas separation, the transformer oil by degassing, filtration can be \ninjected back to the transformer.\nIt should be noted that the operating time of the TDLAS gas detection system includes the following steps: \nvacuum extraction, 2 minute; oil injection, 1 minute; oil and gas separation, 2 min; gas detection and data pro-\ncessing, 1 minute; emptying the oil chamber, 2 min. Therefore, the entire detection process is less than 8 minutes \nwhich can meet the needs of on-line monitoring and rapid measurement.\nThe detection system can respond quickly to changes in gas concentration. When the oil and gas separation is \ncomplete, the detection system can get the gas signal within 5 seconds.\nResults\nCross-sensitivity. Typically, there are 7 fault gases produced by oxidation, insulation decomposition, and oil \nbreakdown: H2, CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, CO, CO2. H2O is also included in the oil.\nIn order to determine whether there is a multi-gas cross-sensitive problem in the selected wavelength range, \nwe query the HITRAN database and perform cross-sensitivity testing. The absence of absorption lines of CH 4, \nC2H2, H2O, and CO2 from HITRAN in the vicinity of 1530.370 nm are shown in Fig. 5(a). In the region, water \n(other impurities absorption intensity is weak) has absorption line, but the absorption intensity of water is four \norders of magnitude lower than that of acetylene. Besides that, the water content in the oil is strictly controlled to \nvery small for insulation strength. The impact of these impurities on the detection of acetylene is minimal. The \ngas listed in Fig. 5(b) is the fault gas that characterizes the transformer failure. It can be seen that these impurities \ndo not affect acetylene detection.\nTherefore, the selection of wavelengths of 1530.370 nm absorption lines can avoid H\n2, CH4, C2H4, C2H6, CO, \nCO2 gas cross-interference.\nIn the same environment, different concentrations of C2H2, H2, CO2, CH4, C2H6, C2H4 and CO, ranging from \n200 to 1000 ppm were mixed and measured, and 2 f signals were shown in Fig. 5(b), where only acetylene gas has \na significant absorption signal, the absorption of other gases does not exceed 2% of acetylene.\nThe results of cross sensitivity test showed that H 2, CH4, C2H4, C2H6, CO, and CO2 do not change with the \nincrease of concentration in the selected wavelength range. Only the acetylene gas concentration and the sec-\nond harmonic signal showed a significant positive correlation. Concluded from the absorption intensity in the \nFigure 4. Procedures of measurement.\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n5\nScientific  RepoRts  | 7: 14961  | DOI:10.1038/s41598-017-13823-0\nHITRAN database and the result of multi gases interference tests, the detection of acetylene in this wavelength \nrange is not affected by the concentration of other gases.\nResult of calibration. According to the procedure mentioned in Fig.  4, the prepared oil samples were \ninjected into the oil chamber. The detection performance indexes of the TDLAS system are obtained with exper-\niment, including goodness of fit, repeatability, limit of detection.\nThere were seven different concentrations acetylene of oil in the test. Six oil samples were prepared for each \nconcentration. We tested a total of 42 oil samples and shown the test result at Fig.  6. Equation (4) is calculated \nbased on the actual measurement of all 42 oil samples.\nGoodness of fit. The test results show that 2 f signal is proportional to the concentration of acetylene gas dis-\nsolved in the oil as shown in Fig. 6(c). According to 2 f signal and gas concentration to fit, the expression is:\n=. ×+ .yx 0 0071 0 0454 (4)\nx is the concentration of gas to be detected, ppm. y is the 2 f signal amplitude, V .\nThe coefficient of determination R2 is 0.9965. A linear relationship between peak-peak value of 2 f signal and \nacetylene concentration can be obtained. And the sensitivity can be calculated as 7.1 mV/ppm.\nTo investigate the goodness of fitting, the amplitude of 2 f signal was substituted into fitting equation, and \nresidual errors were obtained by subtracting calculated value from conventional DGA results, as shown in \nFig. 6(d).\nRepeatability. In the test, all seven different concentrations oil samples were tested for six times.\nNo. 6 concentration oil samples are the most dispersed. No.6 oil samples concentrations is 186.9 ppm, meas-\nured by GC (gas chromatography). The average concentration of the six tests is 176.6 ppm. The deviation is 5.6% \nof the value measured by GC.\nThe system has better performance in lower concentration range (below 50 ppm).The maximum concentra-\ntion deviation is 1.4 ppm.\nThe results show that the trace gas measurement system has good repeatability.\nLimit of detection. In order to obtain limit of detection, a signal-noise ratio (SNR) method is commonly used. It \nis generally considered that the signal-to-noise ratio at 3: 1 is acceptable for the limit of detection. The initial noise \ndata that not been pre-processed has a large effect on the detection limit, so we use Savitzky–Golay filter\n25,26 to \nreduce the effect of high frequency noise on the calculation results. The results of the filtering are shown in Fig. 7.\nThen the blank noise is 0.0163 V , and the limit of detection is:\n×. −. .= .(3 0 0163 0 0454)/0 0071 04 9 ppm (5)\nTest results of operational transformer. We obtained four oil samples from two operational transform-\ners in the 220 kV substation. The test results are shown in Table 1. Oil samples were taken from Gukeng substation \n220 kV transformer, Dongguan City, Guangdong Province, China. For the transformer, high concentration of \nacetylene indicates that the transformer has some defects that may induce transformer failure, and low concen-\ntration we measured indicates that the transformer is operating in good condition.\nThe maximum measurement deviation of the test results is 0.61 ppm. These results indicate that the detection \nsystem designed in this manuscript can be used for substation monitoring.\nAccording to standard IEC 60599 and IEEE Guide for the Interpretation of Gases Generated in Oil-Immersed \nTransformers, acetylene ranges of 90% typical gas concentration values observed in power transform-\ners, from about 25 electrical networks worldwide and including more than 20000 transformers, is 2–20ppm. \nFigure 5. (a) The absorption line of the gases and moisture that may dissolve in the transformer oil (b) 2 f signal \nof seven gases (C2H2, H2, CO2, CH4, C2H6, C2H4 and CO) in gas phase, the carrier gas is nitrogen.\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n6\nScientific  RepoRts  | 7: 14961  | DOI:10.1038/s41598-017-13823-0\nAnd a four-level criterion has been developed to classify risks to transformers. For condition 4, when acety-\nlene > 35ppm, continued operation could result in failure of the transformer. Thus, the detection range of the \nsystem in the experiment, 0–250 ppm, is enough to evaluate the system performance.\nFigure 6.

A new optical method based on the tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) technique is \nproposed to detect the dissolved acetylene gas in transformer oil. The wavelength modulation strategy with \ncenter wavelength of 1530.370 nm and Herriott cell were selected to ensure high sensitivity detection. The \nTDLAS acetylene detection system developed in this manuscript has excellent performance: sensitivity of \n7.1 mV /ppm; limit of detection is 0.49 ppm, lower than the online monitoring requirement.\n II. The proposed detection system has tremendous advantages, such as: immediate response to concentration \nchanges; eliminating carrier gas; no cross interference from background gases; wide range of measurable \ngases. And the system can save the time of detection, with the detection process less than eight minutes, \nproved to be a promising technique instead of conventional DGA equipment.\nData availability statement.
