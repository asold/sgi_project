INTRODUCTION \nA. BACKGROUND OF SENTIMENT ANALYSIS \nSince the dawn of civilization, the art of communication has \nbeen fundamental to strengthening interpersonal bonds. \nSocial media has developed into an effective instrument for \nnetworking, and as a result, almost every part of society uses \nit nowadays [1]. Online marketplaces make up the bulk of \nsocial media. The majority of consumers now choose to shop \nonline due to the fast expansion of e -commerce knowledge. \nDepending on the customer's experience, people can use \nsocial media to offer positive or negative f eedback on a \nvariety of circumstances, items, and resources. Because they \nhelp enhance the services, negative remarks are crucial to the \ncompany's success. Sentiment analysis is useful in this \ncontext [2]. \nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

Sentiment analysis is typically \nperformed at three levels, according to various research \nstudies: sentence -level, docu ment-level, and phrase -level \n[3]. The process of sentiment analysis is illustrated in Figure \n1, with its sub-stages. \n \nFIGURE 1. Sentiment Analysis’s Stages \nB. IMPORTANCE OF REVIEWS IN SENTIMENT \nANALYSIS \nResearch into people's thoughts, feelings, attitudes, and \nemotions is known as sentiment analysis. According to [4], \nit's one of the hotspots for NLP research. The field of data \nmining has been extensively researched. Hence, this study \nhas expanded beyond the realm of science to encompass the \nfields of management and social science. As platforms like \nTwitter, microblogs, and chat rooms continue to grow in \npopularity, sentiment analysis is becoming an increasingly \nimportant tool [5]. Now, more than ever befo re, a vast \nquantity of opinions can be collected and analyzed digitally. \nOpinions are fundamental to all human endeavors, which is \nwhy sentiment analysis technologies find widespread usage \nin both commercial and non -profit sectors. As a result, they \nhave a  major impact on how we act [6]. Everyone else's \nviews and values shape our worldview, which in turn \ninfluences our beliefs, perceptions, and choices. It is for this \nreason that people frequently ask for other people's opinions \nwhen a decision needs to be made [7]. Both people and \nbusinesses can benefit from this. Customers rate and review \nitems on Amazon. The purpose of these reviews varies from \nproduct to product, but generally speaking, they help \nbusinesses improve their offerings and draw attention to \nthose that have received unfavorable feedback [8]. \nThe expansion of the internet is influencing the business \nsector since it speeds up the flow of information. Some \ncustomers will share their thoughts about a product they've \npurchased on review sites or social media [9]. Among the \nmany internet marketplaces, Amazon.com stands out. To \nhandle massive amounts of text, an opinion engine is \nrequired. The process of sentiment analysis makes use of the \ntext mining technique. Through the processing and analysis \nof massive amounts of data, text mining enables the \nuncovering of previously unseen information or trends [10]. \nThey state that text mining is able to help with problems like \nprocessing, organizing, grouping, and analyzing massive \nvolumes of unstructured material. Classification is one \nmining technique.  \nC. ADVANCED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE \nTECHNIQUES FOR SENTIMENT ANALYSIS \nAn ever -growing role for machine learning in sentiment \nanalysis has emerged within the last decade [11]. There has \nbeen a meteoric rise in the application of sentiment analysis \nwith the introduction and development of deep learning \nprocedures. Lack of clea rly defined confidence metrics for \npredictions made by such methods is a mutual matter in \nmachine learning [12], making it impossible to determine \nwhere in the review (feature) space trustworthy predictions \ncan be anticipated. \nIn the group of confidence predictors, conformal \nprediction offers a structure that lets data be shared, which \nlets very specific confidence measures be used at the instance \nlevel [13]. It is important to note that conformal prediction \ndoes not add any add itional requirements when creating \nconfidence predictors because all machine learning methods \ntypically assume exchangeability or, more frequently, that \nthe data is IID (Independent and Identically Distributed) \n[14]. \nUsing the word vector network, nearly 5.2 million reviews \nfrom the following categories were analyzed for sentiment \non Amazon: beauty, books, electronics, and home [15]. This \nwas done in conjunction with density -based conformal \nprediction, and one of the three datasets studied was the 50k \nIMDb review dataset, which is well-balanced (1:1). \nD. MOTIVATION OF THE RESEARCH WORK \nIn response to the increasing demand for SA, businesses and \norganizations are focusing on improving their public \nrelations, launching campaigns, strengthening their weak \nspots, and expanding their clientele. Feedback from \nconsumers regarding a company's go ods and services is \nhighly valued [16]. In addition, political groups like to know \nhow the general public perceives them and how the media \ncovers them. These days, SA is more concerned with \ndeciphering the feelings conveyed in reviews posted on \nsocial media. Many fields have begun to adopt SA, including \nthose dealing with harassment, politics, entertainment, \nsports, and even medicine [17]. \nCurrent research topics in SA include better natural \nlanguage processing (NLP) methods, data mining for \nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

It has been common practice to employ support vector \nmachines (SVM) to address various NLP issues for quite \nsome time. Neural network (NN) techniques built on dense \nvector illustrations have  lately attained state -of-the-art \npresentations in various NLP -related applications [19]. In \ntheir early days, deep learning NNs showed great promise in \ntasks involving pattern recognition and computer vision. \nThis development has algorithms for handling complex NLP \ntasks like sentiment analysis. \nE. CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY  \nWhen the system's developers realized how crucial \nsentiment analysis was for online life, they set out to improve \nthe process. In terms of computer complexity, the proposed \nstrategy yields the same or better outcomes with the highest \nlevel of certainty and the lowest amount of effort expended \n[20]. The study has looked into how dif ferent preprocessing \nsteps, like cleaning and normalizing the data, removing \nhashtags and punctuation, changing the text to lowercase, \nand tokenizing, affected customer reviews. The research in \nthis paper employs optimized deep learning methods to \nexamine customer reviews on Amazon. \n• At first, data is retrieved from Amazon.com and \nsubjected to a series of pre-processing procedures in order to \nclean it up. \n• The characteristics are formed from the pre -\nprocessed texts using various word embedding approaches. \n• The research suggests a hierarchical dual -path \nbackbone to enhance review detection performance by \ngiving CNN global attention. \n• We suggest a straightforward yet efficient solution \ncalled a bidirectional connection module that allows two \nparallel ways to communicate context information. \n• Without utilizing complicated and computationally \nintensive modules, the entire model produces features that \nare robust to scale through the use of a multi -head attention \nblock during the concentrating phase. \n• At last, the study was assessed using various \nmetrics, including precision, recall, accuracy, and F1 -score, \nin conjunction with pre-existing methods. \nF. PAPER ORGANIZATION \nSection 1 begins with a brief overview of sentiment analysis \nand its significance before moving on to review \nclassification. Section 2 provides a comprehensive analysis \nof current models along with their limitations. Section 3 \nprovides the study materials, while Section 4 provides a brief \nclarification of the suggested model. As promised in Section \n5, here is the experimental data to back up the effectiveness \nof the suggested model. Section 6 concludes with a \ndemonstration of future work. \n \n \nII. RELATED WORK \n     A convolutional neural network (CNN) model for  \nnegative/positive sentiment classification in text reviews has \nbeen provided by Qorich & El Ouazzani [21]. To find the \nbest model, we also compared our suggested CNN model \nwith other models' word embedding representations. Using \nthe Amazon reviews dataset, the tests show that several \nmodel designs can obtain acceptabl e performances. Results \nshow that stop -words should be included in sentiment \nanalysis tasks; removing them can lead to a wrong prediction \nof sentiment. In practice, compared to the CNN model that \ndidn't use stop words, th e one that did saw an improvement \nof 2% in accuracy. Additionally, we proved that on large -\nscale datasets, using a random initialization method \noutperforms supervised and embedded model vectors. The \nmodel can learn more accurate features with less \ncomputational effort after training the word embedding \nrepresentation. In addition, our CNN model outperformed \nthe baseline ML and DL approaches, and we increased CNN \naccuracy to 90% on the Amazon reviews dataset. \n \nResearchers V ollero et al. [22] set out to use social media  \ncomments made by Amazon customers to determine what \nfactors most influence the company's stock price. Using \nNLP-based methods, they analyzed the content and \nsentiment of user comments extracted from the Facebook \npages of three major Italian retailers over the course of two \nyears (2016 -2018) to determine the extent to which these \nretailers' service attributes were associated with Amazon -\nrelated customer dissatisfaction. Consumers have a lot to say \nabout the impact of Amazon on retailers of consumer \nelectronics, particularly in the areas of pricing, service, in -\nstore personnel, and after -sale assistance. Consumers' \nunfavorable views in Facebook comments, when compared \nwith similar assessments on the I talian Amazon website, \nindicate that Amazon's service standards have increased \nconsumer expectations and decreased consumer satisfaction \nwhen interacting with other businesses. Beyond the \ncommonly recognized determinants of price and logistics, \nthey propose additional study to elucidate Amazonification \nin terms of customer impatience and discontent more \nbroadly. \n \nThe goal of the research by Venkataraman and Jadhav [23] \nwas to analyze customer reviews of mobile phones, \ncategorize them into different star ratings, and then find out \nhow accurate the ratings were in expressing the mood. This \ncould only be accomplished once the data had been cleansed \nand pre -processed. The TF -IDF approach and word \nembedding were then used to convert the text into numerical \nnumbers. Ultimately, various methods such as Support \nVector Machines, Logistic Regression, and Ensemble \nmodels were employed, and the accuracy of their \nperformance was studied. A number of criteria are utilized \nfor evaluation, including recall, accuracy, precision, and the \nF1-Score. On a balanced classifier with Unigram performs \nbetter. \n \nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

[24] that can analyze reviews and extract feelings \nto use in making recommendations. To provide suggestions \nfor those who can add extra data, like the review sentiment, \nthey deployed sophisticated algorithms. In several cases, \nsuch as the music industry, they found no strong c orrelation \nbetween the ratings and the sentiments expressed in user \nevaluations. As a result, sentiment may serve as an additional \nindicator of user input, revealing a new facet of consumer \npreferences. To evaluate the effectiveness of their suggested \nhybrid recommender system, they have taken into account \nboth star ratings and review sentiment. For this study, they \nused two popular datasets —Amazon Digital Music and \nGames—and demonstrated that the suggested hybrid \nrecommender system outperformed several bas elines. Two \nevaluation scenarios were used to make the comparisons: \none where the ratings were taken as user feedback and the \nother where the review sentiments were used as user input. \n \nTo recover the rating matrix and aid in recommendation, Liu \nand Zhao [25] provide a sentiment analysis and matrix \nfactorization (SAMF) based recommendation system. This \nsystem employs deep learning technologies and topic models \nto fully mine the implicit information in reviews. First, LDA \n(Latent Dirichlet Allocation) is used to construct user topic \ndistribution from reviews, which comprise both user reviews \nand item reviews. On the basis of topic likelihood, the user \nfeature matrix and object feature matri x are generated. The \nsecond step is to combine the user feature matrix with the \nitem feature matrix to form a user-item preference matrix. In \nthe third step, the user -item rating matrix is created by \nintegrating the original rating matrix with matrix. Lastly, the \nuser-item rating matrix is updated and modified using BERT \n(Bidirectional Encoder which quantifies the sentiment info \nin the reviews and integrates it with the rating matrix. Lastly, \nrating prediction and Top -N suggestion are accomplished \nusing the  updated user -item rating matrix. Results from \nexperiments conducted using Amazon datasets show that the \nsuggested SAMF outperforms other traditional algorithms \nwhen it comes to suggestion performance. \n \nIn their publication, Jin et al. [26] introduced the Amazon -\nM2 Multilingual Multi -Locale Shopping Session Dataset. \nWith millions of user sessions across six countries and \nlanguages, this dataset is the first of its kind. English, \nGerman, Italian, and Spani sh are the most common product \nlanguages. Surprisingly, the dataset can aid in improving \npersonalization and understanding of user preferences, \nwhich in turn can enable new activities and improve existing \nones. This work introduces three tasks: next -product title \ngeneration—to assess the possibilities of the dataset. By \ncompleting the aforementioned tasks, we are able to compare \nvarious algorithms on our suggested dataset, which allows us \nto gain valuable insights for future studies and applications. \nThe KDD CUP 2023 competition we ran, which was based \non the suggested dataset and challenges, also had thousands \nof entries. \n \nAs recommendations to users, Lakshmi & Bhavani [27] have \nprovided the top k links predicted by link prediction \nmeasures. At first, they modify various preexisting link \nprediction methods and apply them to the recommendation \nissue. A recommendation framewor k based on the problem \nin social networks is proposed as the main contribution of \nthis work. This framework makes use of incorporates \ntemporal data that is available on existing links. We test the \nsuggested method on three different datasets: one from \nMovieLens, one from Epinions and Amazon, and one from \nTripAdvisor, which contains ratings for hotels. When it \ncomes to enhancing recommendation quality, the results \nreveal that link prediction techniques based on temporal \nprobabilistic info work better. Regard ing Movie Lens, \nEpinions, TripAdvisor, and Amazon specifically, the area \nunder the ROC curve (AUROC) is improved by 10%, 23%, \n17%, and 9% respectively, as compared to the usual item -\nbased collaborative filtering method using the temporal \ncooccurrence proba bility measure. Area under Normalized \nRank-Score both show comparable enhanced performance. \n \nUsing the Transformer Perfect—a deep learning perfect that \neffectively integrates textual and utility matrix info —Ho et \nal., [28] have projected a new approach. In order to get the \nmost out of the Transformer model, the research \nrecommends feature extraction strategies that are well-suited \nto each data source. With a reduction ranging from 10.79% \nto datasets, the experimental results show that the suggested \nmodel considerably enhances recommendation accuracy \nwhen associated with the baseline for the metric.  The \nsuggested model also reduces the MAE measure by 34.82% \nto 56.17% for the Amazon sub -datasets in comparison to \nSVD, widely recognized as one of the best representations \nfor recommender systems. With improvements in Precision \nof up to 108%, MAE of up to  65.37%, and RMSE of up to \n59.24%, our suggested model surpasses the graph -based \nmodel in terms of performance. Results from experiments \nconducted on Amazon datasets further show that our \nsuggested strategy outperforms a model that just relies on \nutility matrix data by incorporating information from textual \nsources. \n \nConcerning user behavior data in FedRecs, Yuan et al. [29] \nhave investigated the privacy concern. To be more precise, \nwe conduct the initial comprehensive investigation into \nassaults on FedRecs that aim to infer membership at the \ninteraction level. After d esigning an attacker that targets \ninteractions through membership inference, the protection \nmechanism known as Local Differential Privacy (LDP) is \nused to counter this attack. Unless recommendation \nperformance is severely impaired, actual research reveals \nthat LDP is ineffective against such novel threats. We \ndevelop a straightforward defense mechanism to lessen the \nimpact of interaction-level membership attacks by lowering \nthe attacker's inference accuracy while maintaining \nrecommendation presentation. The efficacy of our solutions \nis demonstrated by extensive trials carried out with two \npopular datasets. \nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

By comparing it to previous \nworks, it is clear that DeepLSGR offers better \nrecommendations. \n \nTo overcome the issue of data distortion caused by sparsity, \nKuo & Li [31] used the particle swarm optimization method \n(PSO) to find the optimal similarity of customer ratings. In \naddition, the features of customer feedback were extracted \nusing representations from transformers (BERT). Lastly, the \nPSO was used to mix the features of various data kinds and \nfind the right weight matrix. If rating and review data were \ncombined, recommendation performance may be \nsignificantly enhanced. Furthermore, the suggested approach \nsurpassed multiple prior approaches in terms of mean \nsquared error and mean complete error when tested on six \nAmazon datasets. \n \nThe collaboration Variational Graph Auto-Encoder (CVGA) \nis a new end-to-end graph recommendation model projected \nby Zhang et al., [32]. It encodes user -item collaboration \ninteraction bipartite graph using the info propagation and \naggregation principles. In stead of learning user or item \nembeddings, these associations are used to infer the \nprobability distribution of user behavior for parameter \nestimation. In doing so, we make a plausible and elegant \nreconstruction of the full user -item interaction graph \nrendering to the known probability distribution. Looking at \nit through the lens, we can solve the graph recommendation \ntask with almost linear time complexity by transforming it \ninto a graph creation problem. We show that CVGA can be \ntrained quicker than state-of-the-art baselines for tasks while \nretaining comparable performance across four datasets. \nAdditional research confirms that CVGA is capable of \nsolving the data sparsity issue and works just as well with \nmassive datasets. \n \nA new method that uses LLMs to build personalized \nreasoning graphs has been proposed by Wang et al., [33]. To \nreflect the user's interests in a way that can be understood, \nthese graphs connect their profile with their behavioral \nsequences using causal and logical deductions. Chained \ngraph reasoning, knowledge base self -improvement makes \nup our technique, LLM reasoning graphs (LLMRG). In order \nto enhance traditional recommender systems, the resulting \nreasoning is encoded networks; this process does not \nnecessitate any new information about users or items. Our \nmethod shows how LLMs can make personalized reasoning \ngraphs that enable recommender systems to be more rational \nand interpretable. Recommendations can take advantage of \nLLM-derived reasoning graphs and constructed \nrecommendation systems with LLMRG. On both \nbenchmarks and real-world scenarios, we show that LLMRG \nimproves base recommendation models. \n \nA new method for recommendation based on the semantic \nawareness of HIN embeddings, SemHE4Rec, was proposed \nby Pham et al., [34]. To learn user and item representations \nin HIN efficiently, we offer the SemHE4Rec model, which \nincludes two embedding approache s. Then, the matrix \nfactorization (MF) procedure is made easier with these user \nrepresentations that are rich in structural details. To begin, \nthere is the time -honored method of co -occurrence \nrepresentation learning (CoRL), which seeks to understand \nthe f requency with which users' and things' structural \ncharacteristics occur together. By means of meta -paths, the \nlinkages between these structural elements are depicted. \nSpecifically, we use the heterogeneous Skip -gram \narchitecture and the famous walk approac h to achieve this. \nThe second way for embedding is an SRL approach, which \nstands for semantic -aware representation learning. The \nrecommendation task's focus is the primary focus of the SRL \nembedding technique. Lastly, in order to complete the \nrecommendation task, all of the learned user and item \nillustrations are integrated with the extended MF and \noptimized together. In contrast to the state -of-the-art \nrecommendation techniques that use HIN embedding, the \nproposed SemHE4Rec performs well on real-world datasets. \nThe experiments also show that combining representation \nlearning improves recommendation performance. \n \nLastly, the literature research reveals that there are numerous \nobstacles impacting the effectiveness and accuracy of \nsentiment analysis and social media content evaluation. \nIII.

DATA PRE-PROCESSING \nText data analysis relies heavily on data pre-processing [37]. \nTweets, blogs, reviews, and other forms of textual content \nmight have repeats and redundancies, which can make text \ndata more complex. The study has looked into how different \npreprocessing steps, like cleaning and normalizing the data, \nremoving hashtags and punctuation, changing the text to \nlowercase, and tokenizing, affected customer reviews. Data \npre-processing is a filtering procedure that is used in data \nnormalization. For instance, data pre -processing may \ninvolve normalizing the data, tokenizing words, eliminating \nstop words, padding, and excess spaces, transforming text \ndata to lowercase, and removing hash tagging. The data in \nthe necessary format was achieved through the \nimplementation of numerous tasks in this job. \n1) ERASE PUNCTUATION \nBetween forty and fifty percent of every given piece of \nwritten text is punctuation. The results of any sentiment \nanalysis model are unaffected by punctuation. These \npunctuations are completely irrelevant to the sentiment \nanalysis, so it is crucial that yo u eliminate them. Here, we \ndisplayed the statistics in their normalized form after \nremoving any punctuation from the text. The resulting text is \ncondensed and made easier to understand. The input data \nwas stripped of any punctuation. \n2) CONVERT THE TEXT DATA TO LOWERCASE \nCustomers post content in reviews that doesn't adhere to \nstandard grammar rules; for example, the text has both \nlowercase and uppercase letters. The study makes extensive \nuse of approaches that are responsive to specific cases. \nConsequently, the classifier  struggles to identify the text's \npolarity. If the entire text is formatted according to industry \nstandards, this problem should go away. In contrast, the \nlower (txt) statement is utilized when the same procedure is \nto be executed manually. It changes all capital letters to \nlowercase while keeping all other characters in their original \nforms. Changing all capital letters to lowercase is \ndemonstrated in the following example: One possible way to \nlowercase \"I Am A Senior Big Data Analyst in Islamabad\" \nis to say \"I am a senior big data analyst in Islamabad.\" \n3) TOKENIZATION OF THE TEXT \nTokenization is a method for segmenting text streams into \nsmaller pieces of text, such as phrases. Tokens consist of \nbroken bits of text. The goal of this method is to simplify \ndifficult textual topics. When tokens are used, data mining \ngets easier. Semant ics and sentiment analysis both benefit \nfrom tokenization, and lexical evaluation relies heavily on it. \nAn integral part of the natural language processing pipeline \nis tokenization. The study will not be able to begin model \ncreation unless the text is clea ned properly. Word tokenize \nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

This \nformatted data can be used for: \n• Count the number of words in the text. \n• Determine the word frequency. At this point, the \ntext data is broken down into words. Miniature word or \nsymbol packets are created from a huge and complicated \nrecord. For instance, \"I am a data analyst in Islamabad\" is \none possible tokenization of the aforementioned text. \n4) REMOVAL OF STOP WORDS \nText files often contain repeated words. Consequently, \nremoving the stop words is of the utmost importance. The \nuse of stop words never adds value to anything written. \nWords of this type tend to appear frequently in written \nworks. This selected data has th e stop words removed from \nit. This method improves system efficiency while reducing \ntextual content. \n5) REMOVAL OF THE HYPERLINK \nLinks have lost all significance in any database. The \nconnections are only useful in a functional sense. To refine \nthe text's polarity, the study exclusively uses tweets, \ncomments, and reviews as representations of ideas and \nfeelings based on the gathered data. Therefore, removing the \nlinks from the databases is of the utmost importance. \n6) REMOVAL OF HASH TAG \nAdditionally, hash tagging is quite trendy right now. \nHashtags are frequently used in customer feedback. \nHashtags take up a lot of space. When it comes to sentiment \nanalysis, hashtags don't work. For the classifiers, these \nsimply increase the level of unce rtainty. Therefore, it is \nabsolutely necessary to eliminate hashtags. The training data \nis made more concise and obvious by removing the hashtags \nfrom the datasets. \n7) REMOVAL OF UNNECESSARY SPACES \nAdditionally, hash tagging is quite trendy right now. \nHashtags are frequently utilized in customer feedback. A lot \nof space is consumed by hashtags. When it comes to \nsentiment analysis, hashtags don't work. For the classifiers, \nthese simply increase the level of uncertainty. Therefore, it \nis absolutely necessary to eliminate hashtags. The training \ndata is made more concise and obvious by removing the \nhashtags from the datasets. \n8) PADDING \nThe classifier has a hard time with sentiment analysis \nbecause the consumer review databases have both very brief \nand very lengthy reviews. The sum of pixels that are added \nto the review when the network evaluates it is known as \nCNN-related padding. Padding is just a few zeros added to \nthe end of our input review to make sure every customer \nreview is the same length. \n9) POS TAGGING \nClassifying training data words according to their \npredetermined grammatical form is the goal of POS. This \ngroup takes word meaning into account. Putting labels on \npoint-of-sale systems is no picnic. While point -of-sale \nlabeling can't fix the severe discovery problem in opinion \nanalysis, it helps a lot with many other issues. This procedure \ngathered several viewpoints and aspects for a product \nreview. To define a specific feature, one uses the altered POS \ntagger. The review gives users access to the grammar  \nrelations-provided POS tagging mechanism. To establish the \nspeech part of the examination, utilize In addition, POS tags \nidentified appropriate substantive and substantial potential \nproblems. The observable output is generated in this POS \nprocess by means  of a concealed Markov model (HMM), \nwhereby tags are concealed. Finding a mathematically \noptimal tag sequence (C) is always the goal when POS is \ntagging. \n𝑃(𝐶|𝑊)    (1) \nwhere C denotes 𝐶1, 𝐶2, 𝐶3, . . . , 𝐶𝑇, and W denotes \n𝑊1, 𝑊2, 𝑊3, and 𝑊𝑇. \nB. Feature Extraction using Word Embedding \nA neural word-to-vector model, Word2Vec [38], predicts the \nvector of a needed word by using its surrounding words. The \nWord2Vec embedding model typically makes use of two \nlearning strategies: skip -gram and CBOW. The CBOW \nmethod uses the current word to bridge the gap between \ncontext words; therefore, it doesn't change the sequence o f \nnearby words, in contrast to the skip -gram strategy, which \nprioritizes nearby words over faraway ones. Using solely \nlocal context, CBOW and skip -gram both learn mutual \nvector representations for every word. \nIn contrast to Word2Vec, GloVe [39] neural word \nembedding takes the full context of words into account. In \nthe GloVe word embedding, a neural network is employed \nto decompose a matrix into a word vector. Because the \nGloVe embedding model takes into account  the association \namong word pairs and provides additional meanings to the \nneural network, it outperforms Word2Vec [39] in word \nresemblance and analogy tests. The weights of common \nword pairings, including \"the\" and \"a,\" are decreased via \nGloVe embedding as  well. On the other hand, a co -\noccurrence matrix —the foundation of the GloVe model —\nrequires a substantial amount of memory for storage \npurposes. \nSince learning is a shared difficulty, FastText [40] follows \nWord2Vec's approach of learning the vector of each word \ntogether with the n -grams inserted within each word. The \nnext stage in training is to create a single vector by averaging \nthe representatio n values. Neural word embedding can \nencode substantial sub -word info using these models, \nalthough GloVe. When it comes to neural word embedding \nmodels, FastText is light years ahead of Word2Vec. \nTransformer bidirectional encoder representations; the \nacronym is BERT [41]. By conditioning the right and left \ncontext at all levels, BERT aims to bidirectional \nrepresentations from unlabeled data. For this reason, it is \nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

CONSTRUCTION OF THE PROPOSED NETWORK  \nFigure 2 depicts the structure of the model that we have \nsuggested. A backbone with Transformer enhancement, an \nattention decoder head with several heads, and a post -\nprocessing algorithm make up the pipeline. \nThe research uses a dual -path approach to integrate self -\nattention and convolution. By handling (FFN) for feature \noutput, it tries to gather information within and across initial \nreceptive fields.  Initially, following the conventional CNN \nbackbone model, the input data is passed through an FPN \nassembly to derive multi -level features. This structure \nconsists of four stages, each with a different downsampling \nrate: f4, 8, 16, 32g, and so on. The second step is to use multi-\nhead attention to extract after upsa mpling the extracted \nfeatures to the same scale. Two maps —one for likelihood \nand one for threshold—will be created using the feature. \n \nFIGURE 2. The Block for the Hybrid Transformer.  \nB. MATHEMATICAL DESIGN OF THE PROPOSED \nNETWORK \n1) TRANSFORMER-ENHANCED BACKBONE \nThe study can logically make CNN and Transformer operate \nin tandem to achieve greater performance since they each \nhave their own limits and complementary advantages. \nConvolutional layers are able to model local relations due to \ntheir inductive bias. Follow ing prior research [42], a 4 × 4 \nwindow is utilized, as shown in Figure 2. Our goal is to \nmaximize efficiency in the CNN path by applying depth -\nwise size. Also, we need to change the number of channels \nso they align with the merged branch, allowing them to  be \nseamlessly integrated because the two paths are \narchitecturally different. Their outputs are combined after \nthe channel adjustment and normalized using separate \nnormalization layers. By optimizing both parallel branches \nat the same time during training, we can achieve stronger \nfeature representation learning by weaving features across \nthe two branches. Then, the final output features are \ngenerated by fusing the learned relations in both routes using \na consecutive Feed Forward Network (FFN). \n2) FEATURE INTERACTION MODULE \nFigure 2 shows that there are bidirectional interactions \nbetween the output features of dual -path branches, and that \nthese features are not merely concentrated. Better \nrepresentation learning in both branches can be achieved \nwith the help of the complement ary clues provided by the \nparallel branches. As one route uses attention to extract \nchannel/spatial context, the other route uses channel/spatial \ninteraction to do the same. The channel and spatial \ninteractions make up the bidirectional interactions within the \nsame block. To begin with, the research utilizes a layout that \nis comparable to the SE layer [43], meaning that data from \nthe convolutional branch is transferred to the other branch \nvia the channel interaction. This structure includes a single \nGAP layer, two layers that are connected with normalization \nand activation, and provide a dynamic weight to various \nchannels. The channel sum is reduced to 1 using info from \nthe branch by means of two consecutive 1 × 1 layers that \ninterconnect with BN and GELU. A dditionally, a sigmoid \nlayer is utilized for the distribution of spatial weights. \n3) HYBRID TRANSFORMER BLOCK \nAn efficient parallel architecture, a FFN network make up \nthe hybrid Transformer block [44]. We also present residual \nconnections, which are defined in the following way: \n𝑋̂𝑖 = 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑐𝑎𝑡(𝐿𝑎𝑦𝑒𝑟𝑁𝑜𝑟𝑚(𝑋𝑖), 𝑀𝑆𝐴(𝑋𝑖), 𝐶𝑂𝑁𝑉(𝑋𝑖) +\n𝑋𝑖)       (2) \n𝑋𝑖+1 = 𝐹𝐹𝑁(𝐿𝑎𝑦𝑒𝑟𝑁𝑜𝑟𝑚(𝑋̂𝑖) + 𝑋̂𝑖) (3) \nwhere 𝑋i where Conv is the depth-wise convolution process, \nMSA denotes the attention branch, and represents the \nfeatures at the ith block. \n4) MULTI-HEAD ATTENTION DECODER \nIn order to combine data from several scales, the majority of \nsemantic segmentation algorithms employ summing up or \ncascading techniques. But paying little attention means that \nsuch a basic fusion paradigm would necessarily miss some \ncrucial elements. Thus , in order to re -attend to the cases \nwhile maintaining the honesty of the spatially hidden text \nregion, the study employs a multi-head attention decoder. \nThe study scales the features from diverse stages into the \nsimilar resolve first so that they can be treated at the similar \nscale. The study denotes the feature maps made from the four \nphases in our backbone as 𝑋 ∈ 𝑅𝑁×𝐶×𝐻×𝑊 = {𝑋𝑖}𝑖=0\n𝑁−1, where \nN is equal to 4. The study uses intermediate feature  𝑆 ∈\n𝑅𝐶×𝐻×𝑊. The features are then divided into N pieces along \nthe channel dimension using a basic but effective multi-head \nattention module [45]. In this case, N is 4. In order to obtain \nthe final fused feature F, the relevant scaled features will be \nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

One way to \nexpress the aforementioned procedures is as: \n𝐹̂ = 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑣(𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑐𝑎𝑡([𝑋0, 𝑋1, 𝑋𝑁−1]))  (4) \nThe research uses a dual -path approach to integrate self -\nattention and convolution. By handling input sending signals \nto the Feed -Forward Network (FFN) for feature output, it \ntries to gather information within and across initial receptive \nfields. \n𝐹 = 𝑀𝑆𝐴(𝐹̂)   (5) \nHere 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑐𝑎𝑡( )stands for the 3 x 3 convolutional layers; \n𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑣 () signifies the concatenation operator. A multi -head \nself-attention system goes by the acronym MSA. According \nto the results, the study's head number is 4, which is also the \nstage number. In this case, \"i\" denotes the head's index. , 𝑖 ∈\n{0,1,2,3}. \n5) POST-PROCESSING \nThe text areas we get can be made more expressive with the \nhelp of suitable post -processing algorithms applied to the \nobtained features. The research must execute binarization \nand label creation activities on the features before they can \nbe parsed into the text areas. \nDifferentiable Binarization : The binarization for the \nlikelihood map was used by [46], which binarization \ntechnique to make probability map ∈ 𝑅𝐻×𝑊 , where \nB∈R^(H×W) that is obligatory for a text or-not judging task. \nThe following is a typical formulation of the conventional \nbinarization process: \n𝐵𝑖,𝑗 = {1        𝑖𝑓 𝑃𝑖,𝑗 ≥ 𝑡\n0      𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒   (6) \nPixel values (x, y) in the probability map are denoted by \n(i,j), and t is a predetermined threshold number. On the other \nhand, differentiable binarization shines when it comes to \nisolating closely jointed text instances and text regions from \nthe background. Hence, the following is a  proposed \napproximate step function: \n𝐵̂𝑖,𝑗 =\n1\n1+𝑒−𝑘(𝑃𝑖,𝑗−𝑇𝑖,𝑗)   (7) \nThe above 𝐵̂ is a learnt adaptive threshold map, and T is \nan approximate binary map. The hyperparameter k is \nempirically adjusted to 30 using the GSK optimisation model \n(discussed in Section 4.2.6). This model mimics the \nbehaviour of normal binarization but is differen tiable, \nallowing it to be optimised during training alongside the \nproposed network. Here, the probability map for the \nbinarization is used to determine the threshold for each pixel \nin the text border map. \nLabel Generation : It was PSENet that served as an \ninspiration for the probability map's label generation [47]. \nTypically, post -processing methods display results as a \npolygonal cluster of vertices.: \n𝐺 = {𝑆𝑘}𝑘=1\n𝑛    (8) \nThe labelling rule in different datasets typically \ndetermines the number of vertices, denoted as n, and the \nreview findings in each data set are represented by the \nsymbol S. In order to speech the challenge of defining the \nboundaries of nearby texts, the Vatti clipping technique was \nsuggested as a means to efficiently produce an offset for \nreducing the size of the initial polygon. One can \nmathematically determine the offset D by using the formula:  \n𝐷 =\n𝐴𝑟𝑒𝑎(𝑃)×(1−𝑟2)\n𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑡𝑒𝑟(𝑃)    (9) \nLocated here the computation of the polygon area is \ndenoted as Area (), the computation of the polygon perimeter \nis denoted as Perimeter ( ), and the shrink ratio, r, is \nanalytically fixed to 0.4. The kernel for each text section is \nproduced readily from the original ground truth using \ngraphics-related processes, which are applied to the \noutcomes of reduced polygons. \nThe first step in obtaining the binary map is to binarize the \nprobability map using a predetermined threshold, which is \ntypically chosen as 0.2 in this case. Second, using the binary \nmap, the research will group the text pixels into smaller \nsections. By applying an offset D' to the shrunken regions, \nthe final text prediction results are enlarged. \n𝐷′ =\n𝐴𝑟𝑒𝑎(𝑃)×𝑟′\n𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑡𝑒𝑟(𝑃)    (10) \n6) HYPER-PARAMETER TUNING USING GSK \nEvery year, new optimisation methods are created and put \ninto use to address practical issues. Thus, the gaining-sharing \nknowledge optimisation method (GSK) was suggested as a \nnew optimisation algorithm not long ago [48]. GSK is an \nprocedure that mimics the procedure of learning and sharing \ninformation throughout the course of a person's lifetime. \nTwo crucial steps are junior gaining - knowledge, which are \nthe fundamental mechanisms that GSK relies on. \n❖ Junior gaining and sharing knowledge:  At this \npoint, the person is attempting to learn as much as they can \nfrom their immediate social network, which consists of \nfriends, family, and neighbours, rather than from more \nextensive online resources like social media. Because they \nare still developi ng their capacity to classify individuals as \ngood or bad, juniors share out of genuine interest and a want \nto learn from those around them, regardless of their level of \nexpertise. \n❖ Senior gaining and sharing knowledge:  At this \npoint in life, one has accumulated a wealth of life experience \nand has established relationships with a larger group of \nindividuals, including friends, coworkers, and social \nnetworks. This is how they learn: by observing those closest \nto them. They also have a great knack for sorting people into \ncategories like \"best,\" \"better,\" and \"worst\" at this stage. This \nleads them to hone their abilities and share what they've \nlearned with the right people. There are multiple stages to the \nexact description of the aforementioned GSK procedure.: \nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

Loading \nof the starting populace is random while regarding the \nboundary restraints, where 𝑥𝑖 (𝑖 =  1, 2, 3, . . . , 𝑁) \ncharacterize the persons; each 𝑥i corresponds to 𝑥ih with \n𝑥𝑖ℎ(𝑥𝑖1, 𝑥𝑖2, 𝑥𝑖3, . . . , 𝑥𝑖𝑑 ), deferring to the potential array of \nacademic specialisations. Put another way, it's like a \nspecialisation that someone is given. A review of the fitness \nlevel of the populace renowned as 𝑓𝑗(𝑗 =  1, 2, 3, . . . , 𝑁) is \nalso conducted. \n❖ The following nonlinear equation is used to \ndetermine the dimension separating junior and senior.: \n𝑑(𝑗𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑜𝑟) = 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏𝑙𝑒𝑚𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒 ∗ (1 −\n𝐺\n𝐺𝑒𝑛)\n𝑘\n  (11) \n𝑑(𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑖𝑜𝑟) = 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏𝑙𝑒𝑚𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒 − 𝑑(𝑗𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑜𝑟)  (12) \nThe junior phase's dimension is d(junior), and the senior \nphase's dimension is d(senior). k is the knowledge rate, \nwhich is greater than zero. The sum of generations is denoted \nby G, and the extreme sum of generations is represented by \nGen. \n❖ The time where juniors gain and share knowledge \nstarts in this step. At this point, everyone is they can from \ntheir small network while also doing their best to pass on \nwhat they've learned. At this stage, their curiosity drives their \ninteractions, thus it doesn't matter if the people they meet are \nfrom their network or not. \nAlgorithm 1 Phase 1: junior gaining and sharing facts \n[48]. \nfor i = 1: (N) do \nfor h = 1: (d) do \n      if 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑑 ≤  𝑘𝑟(knowledge ratio) then \n       if 𝑓(𝑥𝑖 ) >\n𝑓(𝑥𝑟𝑎𝑛)(𝑥𝑟𝑎𝑛 𝑖𝑠 𝑎 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑜𝑚𝑙𝑦 𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑑𝑢𝑎𝑙) \nthen \n             𝑥𝑖ℎ\n𝑛𝑒𝑤 =  𝑥ℎ ∗ 𝐾𝑓[(𝑥(𝑖−1)  −  𝑥(𝑖+1))  + (𝑥𝑟𝑎𝑛 −\n𝑥𝑖)] \n      else \n          𝑥𝑖ℎ\n𝑛𝑒𝑤 =  𝑥ℎ ∗ 𝐾𝑓[(𝑥(𝑖−1)  − 𝑥(𝑖+1))  +  (𝑥𝑖 −\n𝑥𝑟𝑎𝑛)] \n      end \n    else \n      𝑥𝑖ℎ\n𝑛𝑒𝑤 = 𝑥𝑖ℎ\n𝑜𝑙𝑑 \nend \nend \nend \n❖ The present stage's persons are now updated in \naccordance with the junior plan. \n– The participants are decided in climbing order according \nto the standards of the goal function. - In order to learn about \neach person, we pick the best and worst options that are \nclosest to them. Furthermore, one is chosen at random to \nimpart wisdom. \n❖ This step procedure is exposed in Procedure 1. 𝐾f is \nthe facts factor, where 𝐾𝑓 > 0; this limit controls the amount \nof information that is successful to individual. 𝑘r is the \nknowledge ratio, where 𝑘𝑟 ∈ [0, 1]; How much information \ncan be transferred from one person to another is controlled \nby this limit. \n❖ The senior knowledge phase is at this phase. A \nperson's ability to be classified is taken into consideration at \nthis level. At this point, the setup looks like this: \n– First, the standards of the objective purpose sort the \npersons in dominant order. \n– Then, those entities are divided into three collections: \nbest, for example: 𝐵𝑒𝑠𝑡 =  100𝑝%(𝑥𝑏𝑒𝑠𝑡 ), 𝑀𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒 =\n 𝑁 −  (2 ∗  100𝑝%)(𝑥𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒 ), and 𝑊𝑜𝑟𝑠𝑡 =\n 100𝑝%(𝑥𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑠𝑡). \n– Now, two vectors are selected from gaining (100𝑝%), \nwhile central is chosen for sharing 𝑁 −  (2 ∗ 100𝑝%). p \nhere entities, where 𝑝 ∈ [0, 1]. This phase procedure is \nexposed in Algorithm 2. \nAlgorithm 2 Phase 2: senior sharing knowledge [48]. \nfor i = 1: (N) do \n  for h = 1: (d) do \n        if 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑑 ≤  𝑘𝑟 then \n           if 𝑓(𝑥𝑖) > 𝑓(𝑥𝑟𝑎𝑛 ) then \n               𝑥𝑖ℎ\n𝑛𝑒𝑤 = 𝑥ℎ ∗  𝐾𝑓[(𝑥𝑏𝑒𝑠𝑡 − 𝑥𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑠𝑡 ) +\n (𝑥𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒  −  𝑥𝑖 )] \n            else \n              𝑥𝑖ℎ\n𝑛𝑒𝑤 = 𝑥ℎ ∗ 𝐾𝑓[(𝑥𝑏𝑒𝑠𝑡 − 𝑥𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑠𝑡) +  (𝑥𝑖 −\n𝑥𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒  )] \n         end \n       else \n          𝑥𝑖ℎ\n𝑛𝑒𝑤 = 𝑥𝑖ℎ\n𝑜𝑙𝑑 \n     end \n   end \nend \n7) LOSS FUNCTION \nFor training the projected system, function can be expressed \nas: \n𝐿 = 𝐿𝑠 + 𝑎 × 𝐿𝑏 + 𝛽 × 𝐿𝑡  (13) \nThe scheme assigns diverse weights to the likelihood map \nloss Ls, the loss 𝐿b, and the threshold map Lt accordingly.

The manufacturer and \nmodel of the computer are HP, and the operating system is \nWindows 10 Home. The system's CPU is an Intel(R) \nPentium(R) CPU A1020 with 4 logical  processors and 2.41 \nGHz of speed and 2408 MHz of memory.  \nB. EVALUATION METRICS \nReal values that are known and can be found using a \nconfusion matrix are used to make the number of predictions, \nwhich are then classified as correct or erroneous. Results for \n𝑇𝑟𝑢𝑒 𝑁𝑒𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 (𝑇𝑁), 𝐹𝑎𝑙𝑠𝑒 𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 (𝐹𝑃), 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑇𝑟𝑢𝑒 𝑁𝑒𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 (𝑇𝑃) \nare displayed in the confusion matrix for data fitting based \non classes of positive and negative. The model was assessed \nusing a variety of criteria, including the F1 score, recall, \naccuracy, and precision.  \nAccuracy: It evaluates the model's generalizability in \nterms of its ability to improve performance across different \nkinds of classes. Estimation is at its best when every choice \nis useful and significant. The formula is calculated by in-\nbetween the sum of precise judgements by the total sum of \njudgements. \n𝐴𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑦 =  ((𝑇𝑃 +  𝑇𝑁))/((𝑇𝑃 +  𝑇𝑁 +  𝐹𝑃 +  𝐹𝑁)) \n(16) \nPrecision: It establishes the model's positive trial \nclassification accuracy [34]. The sum of all positive cases \ndivided by the sum of positive samples that were correctly or \nerroneously identified yields this value. \n 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 =  𝑇𝑃/(𝑇𝑃 +  𝐹𝑃)  (17) \nRecall: The model's ability to classify positive samples is \nshown by this score. The volume of positive samples divided \nby the sum of positive trials that were precisely identified as \npositive is the formula for the percentage. \n𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 =\n𝑇𝑃\n(𝑇𝑃+𝐹𝑁)  (18) \nF1-measure: A harmonic mean of accuracy is used to \nestimate the F1-measures. \n𝐹1 − 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒 =\n(2×𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛×𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙)\n(𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛+𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙)   (19) \nFigure 3 presents the accuracy and loss for data , where \nFigure 4 provides the ROC curve of the proposed model. \n \nFIGURE 3.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK \nOur aim in composing this article was to contribute to the \nfield of sentiment analysis by elucidating the methods, tools, \nand datasets employed to train our model for accurately \npredicting customer reviews on Amazon. The primary focus \nof this investigation  was on product and customer review \nsentiment analysis across social media and product websites. \nTo tackle the limited receptive fields and inadequate \nmodeling capabilities of the initial CNN module for review \ncategorization, this study proposes a DPTN, or  double-path \ntransformer network. The suggested bidirectional \ninteractions between two parallel branches in DPTN \naugment both local and global perspectives. Additionally, by \nadjusting the hyper -parameters using the GSK optimization \nmethod, the proposed DPT N model enhances the \nclassification performance metrics used to evaluate the \nefficacy of these models on the aforementioned datasets. A \ncomparison of the final results with those of previously \nestablished methods was conducted, and the suggested \noutcomes proved to be satisfactory, either comparable to or \neven surpassing prior methods.  \n \nSome potential limitations of the research paper include: \n• The study focuses specifically on customer reviews \non Amazon, which may limit the generalizability of \nthe findings to other platforms or domains. The \neffectiveness of the proposed DPTN model may \nvary when applied to datasets from different \nsources or industries. \n• Although the GSK optimization method is utilized \nto adjust hyperparameters and enhance model \nperformance, the sensitivity of the proposed DPTN \nmodel to hyperparameter settings might present \nchallenges in practical deployment or fine-tuning. \nLooking ahead, there is scope for further exploration in \nenhancing sentiment analysis techniques. Future studies can \ndelve into integrating self -attention representations with \ndiverse word embedding techniques within deep learning \nframeworks to better unde rstand user interests and provide \nrecommendations. Addressing these areas will build upon \nour work and contribute to advancing sentiment analysis \nmethodologies. \n \nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS \nAll authors contributed equally. \nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT \nThe data that support the findings of this study are available \nupon reasonable request from the authors. \nETHICS APPROVAL \nThe submitted work is original and has not been published \nelsewhere in any form or language.  \nDISCLOSURE OF POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF \nINTEREST \n There is no potential conflict of interest.  \nRESEARCH INVOLVING HUMAN PARTICIPANTS \nAND/OR ANIMALS \nNot Applicable  \nFUNDING \nThe authors declare that no funds, grants, or other support \nwere received during the preparation of this manuscript.  \nCOMPETING INTERESTS \nThe authors have no relevant financial or non -financial \ninterests to disclose. \nREFERENCES \n[1] A.
