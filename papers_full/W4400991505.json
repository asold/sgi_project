  "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title> Navigating urban environments safely is increasingly challenging in today's complex cities. This paper introduces an innovative method for enhancing urban navigation safety through the utilization of advanced vector embeddings derived from Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) crime data, stored within a sophisticated vector database. Our innovative method surpasses traditional safety measures by enabling precise semantic querying, significantly improving route prediction accuracy, assisting law enforcement in resource deployment optimization, and enhancing crime prevention strategies. Our system provides the general public with cutting-edge route recommendations that integrate detailed analyses of crime patterns and contextual information, offering valuable insights for safer navigation. Moreover, through the fusion of real-time crime data from social media and safety apps with a Large Language Model (LLM), we create a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application that provides dynamic, context-aware safety insights. Our findings demonstrate that this innovative approach not only enhances the effectiveness of safety recommendations but also revolutionizes urban safety management, representing a substantial advancement in both crime prediction and resource allocation.",
