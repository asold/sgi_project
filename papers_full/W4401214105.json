Over the past few decades, various approaches have\nbeen proposed to tackle this challenge by adjusting the parameters\nof the algorithms to positively influence the optimization process.\nFor instance, ontology-based approaches aim to formally repre-\nsent the knowledge revolving around the EC field [47] to enable\ninference-based tuning, whereas ML-based approaches [36] learn\nuseful representations for comparing evolutionary runs for land-\nscape analysis. Other approaches pre-define pools of parameter\nvalues [19, 20] and automatically choose from them during the opti-\nmization process. More recently, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has\nbeen considered to automatically train hyperparameter adaptation\npolicies based on data from previously available evolutionary runs\n[40]. In general, all these approaches aim to find the optimal param-\neter settings of an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) before or during\nthe evolutionary optimization process and are usually referred to\nas parameter tuning or parameter control , respectively [9].\nUsing data acquired from evolutionary runs is certainly a viable\napproach to leverage the knowledge acquired from past optimiza-\ntion experiences, as shown in [40]. However, the data generated\nby evolutionary runs can be highly unstructured, and they heavily\ndepend on multiple aspects, such as the problem dimensionalities,\nthe different algorithms and strategies being used, the numerical\nprecision, the verbosity of the logging system in use, etc.\nIn recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have caused a\nprofound revolution in various fields, going beyond the traditional\ndomain of conversational agents. To date, LLMs have been success-\nfully applied to an ever-growing list of domains, such as chemistry\n[3], protein design [12], robotics [34, 38, 44], swarm motion plan-\nning [23], program synthesis [ 18, 21, 39], game design [ 24], and\nurban delivery route optimization [26].\nOne of the main keys to the success of LLMs is that they are ex-\ntremely well-suited for analyzing unstructured textual data, which\nmakes it easy to adapt them to conceptually similar tasks without\nthe need for retraining. Some recent literature [ 5, 32] has inves-\ntigated the direct usage of LLMs for optimization, although it is\nimportant to note that current LLMs are well-suited especially for\narXiv:2408.02451v1  [cs.NE]  5 Aug 2024\nGECCO ’24 Companion, July 14–18, 2024, Melbourne, VIC, Australia Custode et al.\nhigh-level discrete optimization tasks (e.g., planning). On the other\nhand, they are not well-suited for low-level (i.e., numerical) contin-\nuous optimization tasks due to (1) the inference cost of querying\nLLMs, and (2) their limited mathematical reasoning capabilities.\nFinally, several works have investigated the relationship between\nLLM and EC [45], both in the cases where LLMs are used to em-\npower EAs, and in the opposite case. However, none of them studied\nthe use case of hyperparameter optimization, which is an essential\nproblem in EC.\nIn this work, we conduct a preliminary investigation on the pos-\nsibility of automating “empirical” step-size adaptation in Evolution\nStrategies (ES) using LLMs. More specifically, we focus on the case\nof tuning the step-size for (1 +1)-ES using state-of-the-art LLMs,\nnamely Llama2-70b [41] and Mixtral [22]. Our results show that\nLLMs can compete with well-known traditional mechanisms for\nstep-size adaptation.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2\nsummarizes the related work on LLMs and their applications to\noptimization, as well as the early work on EC applied to LLMs.\nSection 3 describes our methods. Section 4 presents the numerical\nresults. Finally, Section 5 concludes this research.\n2 RELATED WORK\nThere is a growing trend to combine the strengths of optimization\nalgorithms with LLMs for various purposes. This synergy is evi-\ndent also in the EC research community, where the ‘LLM’ keyword\nis increasingly prevalent and the increasing number of available\npreprints, see [45] for a recent exhaustive list, is a clear signal that\nmore articles of this kind will soon populate the literature. This\nhighlights a promising direction where LLMs will play an impor-\ntant role in optimization (especially, but not only, evolutionary-\nbased), addressing various challenges associated with optimization\nalgorithms and leading to hybrid systems where optimization algo-\nrithms and LLMs work together for mutual benefits.\n2.1 LLMs as the optimizer\nLLMs make it possible to articulate complex tasks using natural lan-\nguage, thus facilitating and automating decision-making in many\nlogistical scenarios, such as planning and scheduling [28], which\notherwise would require an expert to formulate the problem rigor-\nously (i.e., as a discrete optimization task). For example, ChatGPT\nhas been used to produce the schedule of a construction project\nin [30] and to schedule vehicles and drivers to complete a prede-\ntermined set of trips in a specified period in [43]. These are com-\nbinatorial optimization problems whose operational constraints\nare difficult to formulate mathematically but easy to communicate\nto an LLM. Similarly, in [2], users can ask “what if” questions on\nsupply chain demand for a particular scenario in plain text and\nget answers about the outcomes of an underlying supply chain\noptimization algorithm.\nHyperparameter optimization is another intriguing application\nwhere LLMs can act as the optimizer for other ML models. Com-\npared to traditional hyperparameter optimization methods, the\nresults appear promising [27]. For instance, the studies in [51] and\n[49] leverage GPT-4 to perform Neural Architecture Search and\ndesign autoML frameworks, respectively.\nFinally, Optimization by PROmpting (OPRO) is a framework pro-\nposed in [5] for using LLMs as an iterative heuristic for gradient-free\noptimization. In each optimization step, the OPRO LLM generates\nnew solutions from those contained (including their values) in the\nprevious prompt. As with any EC approach, novel candidate so-\nlutions are evaluated and added to the next prompt for the next\noptimization step. This is a general approach that is usable for both\ndiscrete and continuous problems. The results presented in [5] for\nlinear regression and Travelling Salesman Problems are promising,\nhighlighting that OPRO can optimize the prompts without human\nintervention.\n2.2 EAs for prompt or LLM optimization\nThe need for a good quality prompt has opened the way for the\nprompt optimization/engineering field. The existing literature ex-\nplores different methodologies to optimize prompts. Recent work\n[31] suggests using gradient descent with beam search and bandit\nselection assuming that training data and an LLM API are accessible.\nEC offers various tools for this task, which can also be used when\ntraining data and internal LLM information are inaccessible (i.e.,\nthe gradient information cannot be exploited). Genetic Algorithms\nare widely used [11, 50], and ideas borrowed from EAs are explored\nin the EvoPrompt framework [17]. In [37], an interesting approach\nbased on vectorizing prompts in a continuous subspace employs\nCMA-ES to perform the optimization process.\nLLM architecture search is another intriguing optimization chal-\nlenge. EAs can greatly help explore these vast search spaces. In\nthe AutoBERT-Zero framework [15], this is done by performing\nprimitive math operations and through an interesting “Operation-\nPriority” evolution strategy, which exploits prior information from\noperations during the search. Other studies consider multiple ob-\njectives, such as the one in [ 42], which compares direct search\nmethods and classic heuristics, or the framework in [ 14], where\nEAs are used to find the most suitable distribution of hidden units\nacross layers, ensuring that accuracy and latency requirements are\nmet concurrently.\n2.3 LLMs supporting EAs\nLLMs can support EAs in numerous ways and there is growing\nenthusiasm for employing them to solve various mathematical\nproblems. In this context, the most popular example of incorporat-\ning LLM into EAs is probably the FunSearch algorithm [35]. This\nalgorithm has raised a debate among researchers, with some ap-\nplauding its ability to tackle unresolved mathematical problems\nand demonstrate genuine “intelligence”, while others pointing out\nits limitations, as being “remarkable for the shallowness of the math-\nematical understanding that it seems to exhibit ” [6]. Regardless of\nits public perception, FunSearch is an interesting, but algorithmi-\ncally straightforward approach. It involves employing an LLM to\ngenerate code for a specific subroutine within a larger program in\na Genetic Programming (GP) algorithm, meaning that the LLM is\nembedded into the EA to perform the mutation step. The idea of\nusing LLMs for code generation in EAs is not new. In [25], they are\nused with the MAP-Elites algorithm to generate effective mutation\noperators for GP.\nAn investigation on the use of LLMs for hyperparameter tuning in EAs GECCO ’24 Companion, July 14–18, 2024, Melbourne, VIC, Australia\nFitnesses(1+1) Evolution Strategy\nInitial step size\nPrompt\nLog\nLarge Language ModelAdjusted step size\nFigure 1: A block diagram showing the self-adaptive step-size adaptation scheme studied in this work.\nAlgorithm design is another application of LLMs to EAs. For\nexample, in [10] LLMs are employed to generate and evolve algo-\nrithm components such as initialization, selection, crossover, etc.\nto create new algorithms.\nThere are interesting uses for LLMs in other optimization scenar-\nios. The system described in [29] uses these techniques to simplify\nthe formulation of common complex business optimization prob-\nlems, allowing the optimizer to improve performance in production\nscheduling. In [46], LLMs check the feasibility of solutions to con-\nstraints in discrete spaces to facilitate the application of simulated\nannealing and other single-solution metaheuristics. LLMs can also\nfunction as supervisory logic, e.g., they coordinate agents in the\ncoevolutionary algorithm presented in [7].\n3 METHODS\nIn this work, we leverage LLMs to automatically optimize the step-\nsize for (1 +1)-ES, which generates an offspring by adding, to the\ncurrent solution, a uniform perturbation in a hyper-sphere of radius\n𝜎, the step-size.\nIn our method, the LLM is queried every 𝑝 optimization steps\n(with 𝑝 being user-defined, e.g. based on the available computa-\ntional resources) with the log produced from the beginning of the\noptimization process to the current generation. The LLM is then\nasked to produce a recommendation for the next step-size to be\nused in the subsequent 𝑝 steps. For the LLM-based step-size adap-\ntation, we use a period of 𝑝 = 50 generations to calculate the new\nstep-size.\nWe fix the number of fitness evaluations for all the methods to\n103. Our code is publicly available on GitHub1.\n3.1 Benchmark problems\nWe run (1 +1)-ES on the BBOB suite [13], using the IOHProfiler\nsuite [8]. We test all the BBOB problems with dimensionalities 2, 5,\nand 30, to assess the capabilities of the proposed method to work\nin both low- and moderate-sized problems. For each function, we\n1https://github.com/DIOL-UniTN/llm_step_size_adaptation\nperform 10 independent runs with different starting points. Then,\nwe feed the logs to the LLMs, using the prompt described below.\n3.2 Prompt format\nTo provide the LLM with the information needed to tune the step-\nsize, we initially considered three different options: (1) feeding\nonly the fitness values; (2) feeding genotypes and fitnesses; and (3)\nfeeding the genotypes, the relationships between the genotypes\n(i.e., between the parent solution and its offspring, through the\neffect of mutation), and the fitnesses. However, after preliminary\nexperiments (not reported here for brevity), we did notice that\nthe last two approaches required a substantially higher amount of\ntokens, quickly filling the context window of the models. For this\nreason, we eventually use a prompt that only contained the essential\ninformation to make a decision, i.e., the changes in the step-size\nand the fitnesses of all the last individuals evaluated (depending on\nthe size of the context window).\nAn example of such a prompt can be seen in Listing 1. Here, the\n“system” prompt is used to provide a preliminary context to the\nmodel to properly address the task. Then, the “user” task represents\nthe actual query. Finally, it is important to note that we request\na step-size 𝑠 ∈[0.001, 0.999]to prevent the LLMs from choosing\nexploding step-sizes.\n3.3 Algorithms and LLMs\nOur comparison investigates the performance of different strategies\nfor adapting the step-size of (1 +1)-ES. We employ two baseline\nmethods and two LLM-based methods. The two baselines consist of:\n(1) a constant step-size for the ES (fixed to0.1); and (2) a well-known\nrule-based strategy, namely the One-Fifth success rule [ 33]. The\nlatter changes the step-size by considering the current candidate\n𝑥′= 𝑥 +N(0, 𝜎𝑠 ), where 𝑥 is the parent solution, Nis the Gaussian\n(normal) distribution, and 𝜎𝑠 is the step-size, as follows:\n𝜎′\n𝑠 =\n \n\n1.5𝜎𝑠 𝑖 𝑓 𝑓(𝑥′)< 𝑓 (𝑥)\n1.5−1\n4 𝜎𝑠 𝑖 𝑓 𝑓(𝑥′)> 𝑓 (𝑥)\n𝜎𝑠 𝑖 𝑓 𝑓(𝑥′)= 𝑓 (𝑥)\n(1)\nGECCO ’24 Companion, July 14–18, 2024, Melbourne, VIC, Australia Custode et al.\nRegarding the LLM-based step-size adaptation strategies, we em-\nploy two widely known open-source state-of-the-art LLMs, namely\nLlama2-70b and Mixtral. Llama2-70b is the largest model of the\nLlama2 family [41]. It features 80 transformer layers with a hidden\nsize of 8192 dimensions [4]. It has been trained on 2𝑇 tokens and\nhas a maximum context size of 4096 tokens.\nMixtral [22], instead, is a mixture-of-experts model made of 8\nexperts, each with 32 transformer layers with a hidden size of 4096\ndimensions. It has a context size of 32𝑘 tokens.\nFor both models, we employ Groq’s APIs for accelerated infer-\nence2.\n4 RESULTS\nThe results obtained by the4 methods under comparison are shown\nin Figure 3, aggregating the results for all the problem sizes to facil-\nitate visualization. We observe that, in most cases, the performance\nof both Llama2-70b and Mixtral is comparable to that of the One-\nFifth strategy, suggesting a somehow similar behavior in terms of\nstep-size adaptation. Note that, for the 𝑓 5 function, the methods\nusing constant step-sizes and the one-fifth rule achieve values very\nclose to zero, and thus they are not visible in the boxplot (which\nuses a logarithmic scale).\nTo verify this hypothesis, we studied the step-size used by each\nof the methods under comparison in Figure 2. Note that the trend\nshown in Figure 2 contains the average step-size computed on all\nthe functions of the benchmark, divided by all the dimensionalities\nconsidered before. We observe that, contrary to our expectations,\ntheir impact on the step-size is actually at two opposite extremes. In\nfact, while the One-Fifth rule pushes the step-size to very high val-\nues, the two LLM-based methods tend to progressively reduce the\nstep-size. Yet, their performance appears to be overall similar. More-\nover, it is interesting to note that the variance of the LLM-based\nstep-size adaptation techniques is inversely proportional to the\nproblem dimensionality, while the variance of the one-fifth adapta-\ntion techniques seems much larger in the highest-dimensionality\ncase.\nFinally, to add a further level of comparative evaluation of the\nfour methods, we performed the glicko2-based ranking [ 16] for\nfixed-budget scenarios, available in the IOHAnalyzer platform 3.\nThe results are shown in Tables 1 to 3. In the tables, we observe an\ninteresting trend: Llama2-70b always ranks first, outperforming all\nthe other methods. On the other hand, we see Mixtral as a runner-up\nwhen the problem dimensionality is 2, and it gradually ranks worse\nas the dimensionality of the problem increases. Another interesting\nremark is that, in the highest-dimensionality case (Table 3), both\nMixtral and the One-Fifth rule rank worse than having a constant\nstep-size. On the other hand, in 30 dimensions Llama2-70b is the\nonly method that performs better than simply using a constant\nstep-size.\nThese preliminary results indicate that it is indeed possible to\nhave well-performing step-size adaptation strategies by using the\nreasoning capabilities in LLMs. However, our results also show that\n2https://groq.com\n3https://iohanalyzer.liacs.nl/\nthe outcomes are heavily dependent on the LLM at hand, suggest-\ning that a specialized LLM (e.g., fine-tuned on a large dataset of\nevolutionary runs) could lead to even better results.\n5 CONCLUSIONS\nThe step-size is a crucial parameter in ES. In fact, it allows the user\nto directly control the exploration and exploitation capabilities of\nthe algorithm. While several approaches have been proposed for\nadapting the step-size in ES, there is no one-fits-all strategy that\nsolves this problem. This is due to the fact that step-size control\nheavily depends on the context at hand, which requires some form\nof reasoning. In this direction, we performed a preliminary investi-\ngation on the use of LLMs for tuning the step-size of(1 +1)-ES. Our\nresults indicate that it is possible to find adaptation strategies that\nare competitive with established methods for step-size adaptation,\nsuch as the One-Fifth rule. Moreover, given the fixed budget used in\nour experiments, the approach based on Llama2-70b showed better\nconsistency w.r.t. the other techniques, always ranking as the best\nalgorithm.\nThe present work suggests several interesting future directions,\nsuch as experimenting with different prompts (and the related\ninformation therein) provided to the LLMs, fine-tuning existing\nopen-source LLMs to the specific domain of adaptation strategies,\nconducting a more extensive study on hyperparameter optimization\nfor EAs using LLMs (i.e., using larger budgets, as suggested in [1],\nand more sophisticated step-size adaptation schemes), and finally\ndeveloping an LLM-guided EA.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Anne Auger. 2009.
