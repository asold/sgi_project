  "abstract": "Frequency response analysis (FRA) is a well-known method to assess the mechanical integrity of the active parts of the power transformer. The measurement procedures of FRA are standardized as described in the IEEE and IEC standards. However, the interpretation of FRA results is far from reaching an accepted and definitive methodology as there is no reliable code available in the standard. As a contribution to this necessity, this paper presents an intelligent fault detection and classification algorithm using FRA results. The algorithm is based on a multilayer, feedforward, backpropagation artificial neural network (ANN). First, the adaptive frequency division algorithm is developed and various numerical indicators are used to quantify the differences between FRA traces and obtain feature sets for ANN. Finally, the classification model of ANN is developed to detect and classify different transformer conditions, i.e., healthy windings, healthy windings with saturated core, mechanical deformations, electrical faults, and reproducibility issues due to different test conditions. The database used in this study consists of FRA measurements from 80 power transformers of different designs, ratings, and different manufacturers. The results obtained give evidence of the effectiveness of the proposed classification model for power transformer fault diagnosis using FRA.",
