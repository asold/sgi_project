  "abstract": "Distribution transformers are generally provided with advanced control measures that ensure their operation and safety at a high reliability because their failure usually leads to long power outage, increase maintenance cost and unreliable provision of electricity to customers. Despite the protection measures that accompany a distribution transformer, there is still a need to provide extra remote monitoring systems to increase the reliability of operation and the confidence of instantaneous fault reporting. This paper deals with the design and construction of automatic monitoring system for power transformer parameters. An Arduino board coupled with XBEE module were programmed to enable the monitoring of voltage, current and temperature on a typical power transformer. The system was implemented and tested successfully. Results showed that the voltage versus temperature as well as current versus voltage characteristic obtained, were closed to datasheet specifications and therefore confirming the reliability of the proposed design. This system is therefore recommended as an additional protection that should be added to Power Transformers.",
