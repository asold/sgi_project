It has been suggested that\nbone tools were used for digging up tubers of\nedible plants, excavating termite mounds, or\nas multi-purpose tools. Here we present\nresults of experiments on the efficiency of\nboth bone and stone tools for the excavation of\nmodern termite mounds. Efficiency of pene -\ntrating a termite mound crust is defined by the\ntotal excavated mass of the mound, when\ncontrolling for the number of strokes used.\nWe demonstrate that stones of considerable\nmass are most effective in opening up termite\nmounds, whereas bone tools are relatively\nmore efficient than stone tools when control-\nling for mass. The light weight, efficiency,\nand the nature of polish and wear on some\nSwartkrans artefacts makes it probable that\nselected bone tools were being carried by\nhominids and used for more than one pur-\npose.\nIntroduction\nSwartkrans cave, situated one kilometre\nwest of Sterkfontein in Gauteng province,\nSouth Africa, has yielded fossilized re -\nmains of Paranthropus robustus and Homo\nergaster, together with stone artefacts,\nbone and horn tools, as well as evidence\nfor the controlled use of fire in Pleistocene\ncontexts.\n1 The function of the bone tools\nhas been studied by Brain and Shipman,1\nBackwell and d’Errico2–4 and van Ryne -\nveld.5 Termite foraging has recently been\nemphasized. Here we reconsider these\ninterpretations in light of experiments\nundertaken using both bone and stone\ntools to excavate termite mounds. These\ninsects may have been an important\nsource of protein for Pleistocene homi -\nnids.\nMaterials and methods\nWe examined the following question: to\nwhat effect, if at all, are bone tools more\nefficient than stone tools for breaking\nthrough the hard crust of termite mounds\nassociated with the genus Trinervitermes,\nwhich has a widespread distribution in\nsouthern African savanna habitats?\n6 To\ndo so, we first measured length, width\nand mass of large stone artefacts from\nSwartkrans (Members 1, 2 and 3). The raw\nmaterials of the artefacts were also re -\ncorded. Based on these criteria, 10 experi-\nmental stones of various sizes were\nchosen from naturally available raw\nmaterials exposed at the nearby site of\nKromdraai, and used by us as digging\ntools. We did not modify the experimental\nstones, although mostly altered stones\nwere measured from the Swartkrans\nsample. Our stones were chosen for their\nsuitability for grasping and for having a\nnaturally tapered edge for striking.\nBackwell and d’Errico’s (2001) analysis\nof Swartkrans bone tools suggests that\nthey were manufactured from weathered\nlong bones. Here, bone tools were made\nfrom both weathered and fresh bone. The\nweathered bone tools were made from\nthe remains of modern Equus asinus. The\nspine of a scapula as well as a partial rib\nmade sturdy tools. Two more tools were\nmade from an Equus mandible, simulat-\ning possible use of a Hipparion lybicum\nmandible from Swartkrans (Member 3)\nthat displays wear and polish.\n1 One of our\ntools included both the mandibular and\nascending rami, using the anterior end for\ndigging. The second mandibular tool\nmore closely simulated the Swartkrans\nspecimen in the sense that the ascending\nramus was broken off and the posterior\nportion of the horizontal ramus was used\nfor digging. Both portions of mandible\ncontained all premolars and molars,\nwhich added considerably to the mass of\nthe experimental tool.\nHorn core artefacts are also found in the\nSwartkrans sample.\n1 A weathered horn of\na modern wildebeest ( Connochaetes) was\nused as a tool in our experiments. In addi-\ntion, freshBos femora were obtained from\na local butcher. A large, 3.5-kg quartzite\nstone from this study was used first to\nbreak the shafts of each femur and then\nemployed further to strike off bone flakes.\nIn total, four bone tools were created from\nshaft fragments, one with the distal end of\nthe bone still intact.\nOur experiments were conducted out -\nside the Cradle of Humankind, near\nKrugersdorp, on land recently disturbed\nby fire. The first author used each tool to\nstrike an intact area of termite mound\ncrust 25 times, after which the freshly\nloosened material of the termite mound\nwas collected and weighed.\nResults\nThere is a linear relationship between\nthe length and mass of both stone and\nbone tools (Fig. 1). The two materials\nshow different trajectories (slope of\ngraph), however, due to their different\ndensities. Bone manifested slightly more\nvariation than stone. The difference is not\nof major concern, however, given the\nsmall sample size, the variation in the cor-\ntical and trabecular structure within each\nbone, and the inclusion of both weath -\nered and fresh bone in the figure. The\nlength and mass of the bone tools from\nSwartkrans are not included here because\nof their fragmentary nature and the use of\nplaster in some of their reconstructions.\nThere is an approximately linear rela -\ntionship between the amount of termite\nmound removed with 25 strikes of a\n354 South African Journal of Science 103, September/October 2007 Research in Action\naDepartment of Anthropology, University of Michigan, Ann\nArbor, MI 48109, USA.\nbTransvaal Museum, P .O.

Using this relationship to define\nefficiency, bone and stone tools can again\nbe distinguished, as expressed by differ -\nences in slope of the corresponding re-\ngression lines.\nDiscussion\nBackwell and d’Errico\n2 aver that stone\ntools from Swartkrans have too large a\nsurface area for penetrating the hard\nouter crust of termite mounds. This may\nbe true for stones with a mass under 1 kg,\nwhich corresponds to the majority of the\nsample of modified stone from the site.\nOur results suggest, however, that un -\nmodified stones that weigh over 2 kg are\nmuch more effective for the excavation of\ntermite mounds than bone tools. Using a\nlarge local stone for such a purpose would\nnot leave a signature of hominid use and\ntherefore would not be collected as an\nartefact. However, both manuports and\nmodified stones of this approximate size\nhave been found in deposits excavated\nat Swartkrans, implying that hominids\nvalued large stones for some purpose.\n7\nBone tools are more efficient than\nstones of the same mass, and remove\napproximately twice as much termite\nmound per unit mass for the same effort.\nAs with the Swartkrans bone tools, they\nmay have been used to excavate termites,\nbut they would not have been the most\neffective means available for the removal\nof the outer crust. Once the outer crust\nis broken, the mass of the tool no longer\nrelates to its efficiency in removing the\nsoft interior. The surface area of a tool,\namong other attributes, may then play a\npreferred role for excavating the easily\nremoved inside of the mound.\nThe light weight and relative efficiency\nof bone tools makes them portable yet\nhighly useful for a variety of tasks. Brain\nand Shipman\n1 suggest tuber digging,\nbased on scanning electron microscope\nimages of bone tools. Backwell and\nd’Errico\n2–4 propose the excavation of\ntermite mounds, whereas van Ryneveld5\nconcludes that bone was used for both\ntasks along with others such as bark\nremoval and hide processing. V an Ryne-\nveld’s conclusion is closest to our own,\nbased on the minimally overlapping\nsamples used in the two earlier studies\n(samples obtained from Brain and Ship -\nman, 2004; Backwell and d’Errico, pers.\ncomm.). Although the tools studied by\nBackwell and d’Errico manifest a charac-\nteristic wear pattern that strongly sug -\ngests use on termite mounds, we do not\nconsider that it refutes the analysis con -\nducted by Brain and Shipman on a 75%\ndifferent sample. Until both samples are\nanalysed together, there is no need to\nconsider the two tasks mutually exclu -\nsive. Other support for the multiple-use\nhypothesis comes from the amount of\nwear and polish at the ends of tools in\nthe Swartkrans sample. Backwell and\nd’Errico report that the pattern of wear\nis present after excavating one termite\nmound for about 15–30 minutes. Our\nobservations suggest that although the\nstriations are present after breaking into\none mound, the amount of wear and\npolish does not reflect what is seen in the\nSwartkrans sample. We are confident that\nthe tools were used on multiple occasions\nin order to accrue this level of wear, but\nwhether it would take 4–8 hours of use, as\nBrain and Shipman proposed applied to\ntheir sample, is uncertain. The amount of\nwear and polish does not say anything\nabout different tasks, but it does suggest\nthat tools were used several times, and\nwere probably saved and carried to more\nthan one locality.\nThe most efficient bone tools were shaft\nfragments with an articular surface still\nintact. Our results show that this effi -\nciency was a result of the extra mass pro-\nvided by the articular surface, but can also\nbe related to being easier to grip, as noted\nby van Ryneveld.\n5 The availability of such\nbones from scavenged remains, however,\nwas probably limited because carnivores\nsuch as hyaenas and large cats often gnaw\nepiphyses.\n8, 9 Size selection is also seen in\nthe Swartkrans bone tools. Backwell and\nd'Errico\n2 aver that the bone fragments\nused for tools were 13–16 cm in length.\nLarger tools are more efficient than\nsmaller ones due to their greater mass, but\ntoo much bulk limits portability. This nar-\nrow size range seen in the Swartkrans\nsample might reflect the optimal size for\ntools that would have been both portable\nand effective for breaking into the crusts\nof termite mounds.\nOnly one horn tool was analysed in our\nexperiment, and its efficiency was inter-\nmediate between that of bone and stone\ntools of the same mass. Its greater effi-\nciency than bone was likely due to the\nsharply tapered edge of a tool with\nmass at the upper limit of values obtained\nfor bone. The greater mass came from\nusing the entire horn, however, making it\nunwieldy.\nTermites contribute to the diet of all the\ngreat apes. Gorillas,\n10 orangutans11 and\nchimpanzees are known to break open\nmounds with their hands, and different\ngroups of chimpanzees have developed a\nvariety of techniques of using tools to\nextract termities.\n12,13 Some people (includ-\ning the V enda in South Africa) consume\ntermites, and the high protein resource\nmay have also contributed to the palaeo-\ndiet of australopithecines. Scott et al.\n14\nhave presented results on dental micro -\nwear in hominids, including Australo-\npithecus africanus and A. robustus from\nSterkfontein and Swartkrans, respec -\ntively. They observe ‘some differences’\nbetween microwear in the two species\nand aver that A. robustus may have had a\ndiet that included ‘hard and brittle foods’,\nwhereas A. africanus consumed ‘tough’\nfoods. Stable carbon isotope analyses of\nhominid tooth hydroxyapatite imply\nthe consumption of insects, including\ntermites.\n15,16 Scott et al. 14 state that hard,\nbrittle or tough foods account for patterns\nof microwear in australopithecine teeth,\nbut it is possible that the grit associated\nFig. 2.

Although\nonly a tool’s wear pattern can provide\ndirect evidence of the tasks it performed,\nunderstanding the tool’s efficiency can\nprovide insight into why it was chosen for\nuse. Stones with a mass of over 2 kg are\nmore efficient than bone tools for pene -\ntrating the crust of a termite mound; how-\never, bone tools are more efficient than\nstones of equal mass for excavating the\nexposed mound interior. Bone tools may\nhave been selected by the Swartkrans\nhominids because of their lightness and\nefficiency, making them easily portable\nfor a range of tasks.\nSupport from the Helen McKaig Spuhler Graduate\nFellowship Fund at the Department of Anthropology,\nCollege of Literature, Science and the Arts, University\nof Michigan, is gratefully acknowledged.
