  "abstract": "Think-aloud protocols are a common method to study self-regulated learning (SRL) during learning by problem-solving. Previous studies have manually transcribed and coded students' verbalizations, labeling the presence or absence of SRL strategies and then examined these SRL codes in relation to learning. However, the coding process is difficult to scale, as it is time-consuming and laborious. This aspect potentially limits the ability to measure SRL comprehensively on a larger scale. Recent advancements in language models offer the potential to infer SRL from automated think-aloud transcriptions, which could enhance the efficiency of SRL measurement, complementing log data-based approaches to studying SRL. Therefore, this study explores the possibility of leveraging large language models (LLMs) and machine learning to automatically detect SRL in machine-transcribed student think-aloud transcripts. Specifically, we experimented with two LLMs (Universal Sentence Encoders and OpenAI’s text-embedding-3-small) to predict four SRL categories (processing information, planning, enacting, and realizing errors) in students' verbalizations, collected from three intelligent tutoring systems, covering stoichiometry chemistry and formal logic. We found that these models are reliable at predicting the SRL categories, with AUC scores ranging from 0.696 to 0.915. Models that use embeddings from the text-embedding-3-short model performed significantly better at predicting SRL, including transfer from open-ended to highly scaffolded ITS systems. However, we note limitations in transferring models from the chemistry to logic domain, potentially due to the differences in domain-specific vocabulary. We discuss the practical implications of these models, highlighting the opportunity to analyze think-aloud transcripts at scale to facilitate future SRL research.",
