The changes in connection with the outbreak of the pandemic \nhave made their own adjustments to the educational process, almost \nsimultaneously changing the usual way of full-time education at all levels, \nfrom school to higher professional education. The methodology of \nmultiparametric selection of tools for ensuring the necessary quality of \ntraining, implemented on the principles of System of Systems, allowing the \nUniversity to choose the composition an d configuration of these tools, and \ntaking into account the fuzziness of the source data, is proposed. \nDescription of IM as fuzzy vectors and a method of evaluating \nmisalignments can be the basis for multi-parameter methods of their \nchoice, providing automated selection of the base set support the \neducational process.

As a rule, \nintelligent modules (further - IM) are created for the organization of remote work/study, \nincluding hardware and software that implement the necessary algorithmic support (further \n– AS). The management of higher education institutions faced the difficult task of quickly \nchoosing the most appropriate information platform for work in the current conditions. \nUniversities had to make quick, sometimes ev en experimental, decisions on choosing the \nmost appropriate information platforms or transforming existing ones.  \n                                                 \n* Corresponding author: maoovo@yandex.ru \n210, 18024 (2020)E3S Web of Conferences \nITSE-2020\nhttps://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202021018024\n  © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences. This is an open access article distributed under  the terms of  the Creative\nCommons Attribution License 4.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). \nIn this research, we offered a new way to analyze the proposed information platforms to \nchoose the most effective use of them in a particular University.  \n2 The basic principles of IM analysis  \nWe propose to consider the cho ice of IM and structure of its algorithmic and software tools \nfor the tasks of maintaining the educational process in higher education in conditions of \nrestrictions on full-time training as a process of multiparametric optimization using fuzzy \nlogic criteria [16,18]. The basis for optimization is proposed to apply the method of fuzzy \nmulti-parameter choice. Its mathematical descr iption becomes possible after formalizing \nthe optimization goal (the “ideal” variant)  as a vector of requirements, describing a set of \noptions, and developing qualitative optimizatio n criteria. A mathematical generalized \nstatement of the choice problem can be represented by a set of the following types:                       \n                              <V, F, PT, L, W; T, A>,       (1) \nwhere the source data is assumed to be: \nV - many alternative variants; \nF - multiple descriptions of alternatives; \nPT - the set of outcomes of alternatives; \nL - vector criterion for evaluating the outcome; \nW - the structure of preferences. \nThe next step is to build a solution (rule) or algorithm T that allows you to perform the \ndesired action A over a set of alternatives V.  The preference structure determines the \nprocedure for comparing scores L(P), and the de cision rule (or algorithm) T - the principle \nof selecting elements from the set V based on th e results of comparison in accordance with \nthe required action A. Then the mathematical description of the procedure for selecting IM \nand its elements will consist in revealing the content of the mentioned above components \n(1), taking into account the features of the source data. \nThe uniformity of the description of the system and its elements allows to consider them in \ngeneral as variants of design solutions. The set of alternatives variants in this case will \nconsist of a finite number of elements: \n      \n/g94/g96  .1 , /g32/g32 iVV I ,    (2) \neach of which is described by a fuzzy parameter vector:    \n  \n/g62/g64  . ..., , ..., , ,: 21 imijiiii ppppPV /g32\n  (3) \nThe ideal option will be described by the requirements vector: \n/g62/g64 Tm21 p ..., , ..., , , TjTTT pppP /g32\n    (4) \nThe importance of the requirements parameter is taken into account when setting the \npreference vector: \n/g62/g64   w..., , w..., , w, mj21wW /g32     (5) \nIt is convenient to represent the initial data in general as a matrix of the problem situation: \n210, 18024 (2020)E3S Web of Conferences \nITSE-2020\nhttps://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202021018024\n \n2\n                    , m1, =j     n,1, =i     ;\nij\nP\n  (6) \nwhere Pij - evaluation of the ith variant by the j-parameter; \nn - number of used parameters; \nm - the number of possible solutions. \nThe decision-making procedure is proposed to  be presented as a sequence of actions for \nevaluating, ranking and selecting options in accordance with the system of criteria [10].\nThe set-theoretic approach used in this work  to the selection of IM and its elements was \nbased on a gradual narrowing of the set of possible design solutio ns [12]. The selection \nstages can be considered as a kind of filters th at eliminating out unsatisfactory variants, and \nthe filtering process will be a process of maki ng a decision on the choice of variants in \nconditions of uncertainty.  \nTypical links in the decision-making chai n are the evaluation of possible options, \nranking and subsequent selection among the most preferred ones [11]. Schematically, the \nfour-stage decision-making process is shown in Fig.1, which shows that a narrowing of the \ninitial finite set of introduced restrictions F is at first stage. The result is a set of valid \nvariants /g1848\n/g3031=/g1848∩/g1832 .\nAt the next stage, after evaluating the optio ns according to the s elected criteria, the set \nVd narrows down to the set of rational options /g1848/g3032∈/g1848/g3031. The set V r contains the desired \nsolution /g1845∈/g1848/g3045, received by entering additional preferen ces, or by directly specifying the \noption [10]. \nThus, taking into account the certainty of the parameters of standard tools, the task of \nselecting options in the context of unclear re quirements for a specific application (i.e. for a \nspecific type of University, or even a separate University), in essence, is to choose a system \nof preference criteria. \nAn important point in the decision-maki ng process for choosing an option is the \nselection of evaluation criteria - the evaluatio n function L. This choice largely determines \nthe nature of the process. \nIn previous works, the authors investigated General cases of fuzzy benchmarking, in \nparticular, when comparing two fuzzy vectors, based on measures of Euclid and \nMahalanobis [1,10,11].\nTaking into account the features of the fuzzy set method apparatus, as well as the fact \nthat in this case it is important to have the mutual arrangement of variants on a common \nscale, rather than the clusterability of these va riants, the work uses a measure of mismatch \nbased on the weighted Hamming distance:  \n).( iTi ППWL /;#23#23#23#23#23#23#23#23#23#23#23#23#23#23#23#23/g117/g32     (7)\n210, 18024 (2020)E3S Web of Conferences \nITSE-2020\nhttps://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202021018024\n \n3\nFig. 1. Method of fuzzy multiparametric selection IM \nIt is obvious that the inclusion of qualitative, fuzzy (undefined [10]) estimates will lead \nto a fuzzy total estimate of L and, accordingly,  a certain proportion of the risk of making a \nsuboptimal decision. But this uncertainty, along with the uncertainty of quantitative \nparameters, must be taken into account in  the selection process. The presence of a \ndeterministic (D\ni) and undefined (F i) components for i th variants is determined by the \nformulas:  \n/g1830/g3036= ∑ /g1849/g3036/g1864/g3036/g3037\n/g3031/g3041\n/g3037/g2880/g2869 (8)\n         \n/g1832/g3036= ∑ /g1849/g3036/g1864/g3036/g3037\n/g3033/g3041\n/g3037/g2880/g2869 (9)\nIf there is uncertainty in the source data, indicator (8) cannot be used explicitly, since it \ndoes not provide for working with fuzzy values [2,4-5,11,13,15,18].  \nComplete mismatch can be expressed as follows: \n2FDL ii\nW\ni /g114/g32                (10) \nUsing estimates (8) and (9), you can calculate the level of relative uncertainty: \nDFF iii /g32/g39                (11) \nThus, the expression (10) can be chosen as the main criterion for evaluating variants \nbased on the degree of satisfaction of requirements.  \nThe situation of the decision-making scheme for choosing the optimal option can also be \nrepresented as a decision matrix, see table 1. \nTable 1.

The requirements themselves are shown in a row at the \nbottom of the table. The structure of preference s is set by a row of weight coefficients for \neach of the parameters.  \nThe two columns on the right side of the table contain the deterministic (10) and \nindefinite (11) components of the total estimation of the mismatch of the variant description \nwith the requirements. The data shown in the decision table is the main one for ranking \noptions and choosing the best one.  \nIf we consider the total mismatch (7) as an estimate of a variant, then the entire set of \nvariants can be ranked accord ing to the degree of satisfaction of the requirements. The \nranking procedure involves sorting options according to this estimation. The ranking can be \nbased on the average (determi nistic), maximum, minimum, and threshold values of \nmismatch. The choice of a set of effective va riants is made based on the condition of \nminimizing the total mismatch.   \nBased on the grammar of the linguistic variable \"Value\", alphabets of values are formed \nfor each of the parameters included in the d escription, and the characteristic values of the \ncorresponding fuzzy sets are calculated.  \nThen the empty graphs of the problem situation matrix are filled in with qualitative \nestimations based on expert knowledge, taking into account the selected alphabets. If there \nis no information about the parameter under co nsideration, the linguistic variable \"Any\" is \nassigned, which corresponds to the maximum uncertainty of the information.  \nIn steps 1 to 4 of the methodology, initial d ata is generated for all available IM variants \nfor the selection procedure. The result of this stage of work is the matrix of the problem \nsituation and the corresponding matrix of solutions. For tasks related to the maintenance of \nthe educational process, the corresponding technical requirements for IM are formed, which \nare the average values for all estimates given by specialists and designers. The analysis of \nsuch requirements allowed to make generalized requirements for IM (table 1). \nThe formation of the vector of preference coefficients (10) is based on the procedures of \npairwise comparison and ranking of param eters by their importance (5). The technical \nrequirements vector and the preference vector are part of the terms of reference. \nAs a result of completing steps 1-4, you can star t filling in the solution matrix (table 2), \nwhere the values of the simple criterion L\ni are calculated by formulas (9-14), and the \nweighted Lni by formula (10) for all n variants of IM.  \n210, 18024 (2020)E3S Web of Conferences \nITSE-2020\nhttps://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202021018024\n \n5\nFig. 2. Diagram of the method for selecting the IM variant \nThe next steps for the formation of IM are determined by the deterministic (8) and \nindeterminate (9) components of the criterion (7), as well as the level of relative uncertainty \n(11) for all n. Based on the results of the analysis, the mismatch vectors with the \nrequirements (9) for each of the parameter s are calculated, as well as the total \"Narrowing\" \nof the set of possible variants V to the set of acceptable values V d. It is a cross-section of \nthe α-level of the set V. Three different situations  may occur at this step, depending on the \nselection results. If the Vd set is empty, there is no solution. In the future, correction of the \ncriteria (steps 5-6), or rejection to continue the selection procedure are needed. The ideal \nvariant is the case of a si ngle solution, which means the successful completion of the \nselection procedure of IM. If several elements of the V d set are found, additional criteria \nmust be introduced (3-6). The parameters are configured according to the algorithm until an \nunambiguous stable solution appears.  \nParametric selection of the variant is an im portant stage of its implementation IM in the \neducational process. In accordance with the ma nagement task to be solved and the specific \ntraining and service conditions, it is necessary to  select, build and configure the structure of \nthe software and hardware for IM. The elements of the parametric selection methodology \nIM used in a modified form when selecting AS structure and the route for processing \nstandard training situations within the selected structure. Let's consider one of the variants \nof the method described above.  \n3 Application of fuzzy methods of conducting classes with \nelements of distance learning based on System of Systems \n(SoS)\nIn the modern market of educational services, you can currently find several thousand \nplatforms (portals) of systems that provide their services for conducting classes in remote \n210, 18024 (2020)E3S Web of Conferences \nITSE-2020\nhttps://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202021018024\n \n6\n(distance) mode [2], and not all of them can be used for the effective implementation of the \neducational process, especially if it conc erns various technical and technological laboratory \nwork, which is important for technical universities. \nThere are separate systems that allow to combine different tools on their sites, including \nintegrative ones, namely, to combine not only different formats (multimedia, office \napplications, gaming and interactive environments, tests), but also to connect other external \napplications (for example, proctoring, anti-p lagiarism), i.e. systems made in different \nsoftware languages with different architecture. Su ch platforms must work together, i.e. they \nmust meet the characteristics of SoS, i.e. they will integrate different tools from different \nelectronic platforms that have different prot ocols, are written in different software \nlanguages, they need plug-ins and shields (extensi ons) to work together, i.e. they must have \nelements of interoperability [2], as well as cer tain properties (ease of use, availability of \nappropriate tools for working with students, etc.).  \nImportant features of modern distance learning systems are: \n- effective provision of electronic course m aterials to students, both in traditional forms \n(lectures and seminars) and new ones (self-study, gamification, etc.); \n- a subsystem for analyzing test results that allo ws to draw conclusions about the level of \nknowledge, as well as the quality of training courses; \n- integration with external corporate systems; \n- support of modern standards in the field of distance learning technologies, etc. [5,13].\nThe classification developed by the USA Department of defense identifies four types of \nsystem systems: targeted, generally recognized, collaborative, virtual [4] and if we consider \nthe most commonly used distance education systems in the Russian education system: \nmoodle, 1C - enterprise, Cisco Webex Teams, then in accordance with this classification, \nall of them are generally recognized, since they have a recognized architect who can \ninfluence the components of the system fo r their self-change, according to a given \narchitecture.  \nAccording to the criteria developed by Ma er [17], SoS must have the following \ncharacteristics: \n- operational independence; \n- administrative independence of its elements; \n- emergence from integration into the system; \n- evolutionary development; \n- geographical distribution of elements; \n- a dynamic organizational structure that is able to respond to changes in the environment \nand changes in goals and objectives, the so-called self-organization; \n- a structure that must respond to external cha nges and perceptions of the environment, so-\ncalled adaptation, etc. \nLet's evaluate the degree of compliance of the above distance education systems with \nthe criteria listed above, see table 2. \nTable 2.

For example, gaps in \nmethodological developments, lack of corporate rules and etiquette of online \ncommunication.\n4 Practical applications of the methodology of fuzzy selection of \ndistance learning tools \nLet's consider the possi bility of analyzing the effectiven ess of the above methodology for \nthe following information platforms: Moodle [8], 1C: Enterprise [5], Cisco Webex Teams \n[6], Docent [9] and Hypermethod eLearning Ser ver 4G [7] on typical examples of regional \nand federal universities (see table 3-6).  \nTable 3.

On the basis of normalization and fuzzy ag gregation methods of fuzzy set theory, a \nsingle formalized description of the qualitative and quantitative parameters of IM and its \ncomponents is carried out. Formalization of fuzzy formulated requirements of the \ntechnical specification for IM and local requirem ents for its subsystems in the form of \nfuzzy vectors allowed us to reduce the proc edure for selecting options to the task of \nsearching for the nearest fuzzy regions in the parameter space. \n2. For comparative evaluation of IM, a measure of mismatch between fuzzy parameter \nvalues was used, and quality indicators of IM variants and their subsystems were \nformed, taking into account the importance of the requirements of the technical task.  \n3. Description of IM as fuzzy vectors and a meth od of evaluating misalignments can be the \nbasis for multi-parameter methods of their ch oice, providing automated selection of the \nbase set support the educational process. \nThus, we can say that the remote format of work, which has entered all levels of the \neducational environment, is fixed there, and can be adjusted and developed – adapted to the \nspecific conditions of educational institutions. \nReferences \n1.
