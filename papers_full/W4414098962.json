  "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) such as Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT) are increasingly used across domains, yet their generic training data and propensity for hallucination limit reliability in safety-critical fields like forestry. This paper outlines the conception and prototype of ForestGPT, a domain-specialised assistant designed to support forest professionals while preserving expert oversight. It addresses two looming risks: unverified adoption of generic outputs and professional mistrust of opaque algorithms. We propose a four-level development path: (1) pre-training a transformer on curated forestry literature to create a baseline conversational tool; (2) augmenting it with Retrieval-Augmented Generation to ground answers in local and time-sensitive documents; (3) coupling growth simulators for scenario modeling; and (4) integrating continuous streams from sensors, drones and machinery for real-time decision support. A Level-1 prototype, deployed at Futa Expo 2025 via a mobile app, successfully guided multilingual visitors and demonstrated the feasibility of lightweight fine-tuning on open-weight checkpoints. We analyse technical challenges, multimodal grounding, continual learning, safety certification, and social barriers including data sovereignty, bias and change management. Results indicate that trustworthy, explainable, and accessible LLMs can accelerate the transition to Forestry 5.0, provided that human-in-the-loop guardrails remain central. Future work will extend ForestGPT with full RAG pipelines, simulator coupling and autonomous data ingestion. Whilst exemplified in forestry, a complex, safety-critical, and ecologically vital domain, the proposed architecture and development path are broadly transferable to other sectors that demand trustworthy, domain-specific language models under expert oversight.",
