    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The use of measurement tools is an essential part of good evidence-based practice; however, physiotherapists (PTs) are not always confident when selecting, administering, and interpreting these tools. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of a multifaceted knowledge translation intervention, using PTs as knowledge brokers (KBs) to facilitate the use in clinical practice of four evidence-based measurement tools designed to evaluate and understand motor function in children with cerebral palsy (CP). The KB model evaluated in this study was designed to overcome many of the barriers to research transfer identified in the literature. METHODS: A mixed methods before-after study design was used to evaluate the impact of a six-month KB intervention by 25 KBs on 122 practicing PTs' self-reported knowledge and use of the measurement tools in 28 children's rehabilitation organizations in two regions of Canada. The model was that of PT KBs situated in clinical sites supported by a network of KBs and the research team through a broker to the KBs. Modest financial remuneration to the organizations for the KB time (two hours/week for six months), ongoing resource materials, and personal and intranet support was provided to the KBs. Survey data were collected by questionnaire prior to, immediately following the intervention (six months), and at 12 and 18 months. A mixed effects multinomial logistic regression was used to examine the impact of the intervention over time and by region. The impact of organizational factors was also explored. RESULTS: PTs' self-reported knowledge of all four measurement tools increased significantly over the six-month intervention, and reported use of three of the four measurement tools also increased. Changes were sustained 12 months later. Organizational culture for research and supervisor expectations were significantly associated with uptake of only one of the four measurement tools. CONCLUSIONS: KBs positively influenced PTs' self-reported knowledge and self-reported use of the targeted measurement tools. Further research is warranted to investigate whether this is a feasible, cost-effective model that could be used more broadly in a rehabilitation setting to facilitate the uptake of other measurement tools or evidence-based intervention approaches.",

Standardized measures assist\nphysiotherapists (PTs) to assess children’s abilities, lim-\nitations and potential objectively. Clinical use of reliable\nand valid outcome measures also facilitates collaborative\nclinical and administrative decision-making, and evalua-\ntion of change of children ’ s abilities.

These tools include the Gross\nMotor Function Classification System (GMFCS) [3,4],\nthe Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM-88 [5] and\nGMFM-66 [6-8]), and the Motor Growth Curves\n(MGCs) [9]. When used together, this collection of tools\nprovides an integrated, evidence-based approach to clin-\nical practice and can help service providers set and eval-\nuate intervention goals and answer parents ’ questions\nabout prognosis (Figure 1). These measurement tools\nare recognized internationally in the research/academic\ncommunity as the gold standard measures of motor\nfunction for children with CP. Our group has extensive\nexperience training clinicians to use these tools [10,11]\nand continues to research the development and applica-\ntion of the tools in research and clinical practice\n[12-19].\nAlthough PTs recognize the importance of using stan-\ndardized measures as part of evidence-based practice,\nthey face many challenges in selecting, using and inter-\npreting the information from measures [20]. The chal-\nlenges to moving outcome measures into clinical\npractice in children’s rehabilitation settings [20,21] are\nsimilar to those reported in a systematic review of\nbarriers to moving evidence to practice more broadly\n[22]. Specifically, Cochrane et al. [22] identified seven\ncategories of barriers: supports/resources ( e.g ., time,\nfunding, resources), cognitive/behavioural ( e.g., knowl-\nedge, awareness, skills), healthcare professional ( e.g .,\ncharacteristics, age/maturity of practice, peer influence),\nsystem/process ( e.g., workload, team structure, referral\nprocess), attitudinal/rational-emotive ( e.g ., perceived\ncompetence, perceived outcome expectancy, authority),\nclinical practice guidelines/evidence (e.g., utility, access,\nlocal applicability), and patient factors (e.g., patient char-\nacteristics, adherence).\nA survey of pediatric PTs and occupational therapists\n(OTs) [23] revealed wide variation in the practices of\ntherapists treating young children with CP in relation to\nbest practice guidelines. One solution suggested by the\nauthors was the promotion of knowledge translation\n(KT) strategies to encourage evidence-based practice\namong practicing clinicians. The Canadian Institutes of\nHealth Research defines KT as a‘dynamic and iterative\nprocess that includes synthesis, dissemination, exchange\nand ethically sound application of knowledge to improve\nhealth, provide more effective health services and pro-\nducts and strengthen the healthcare system’ [24].\nResearchers are now beginning to investigate KT stra-\ntegies within clinical contexts.\nIn a study examining the use of outcome measures by\npediatric PTs in the Netherlands, passive KT strategies\nFigure 1 Parents questions and how the motor measures can help. GMFCS = Gross Motor Function Classification System, GMFM = Gross\nMotor Function Measure, CP = Cerebral Palsy.\nRussell et al. Implementation Science 2010, 5:92\nhttp://www.implementationscience.com/content/5/1/92\nPage 2 of 17\nsuch as peer-reviewed journal articles and web-based\nsummaries were found to be effective in increasing\nawareness of outcome measures, but did not increase\ntheir use [25]. Although interactive workshops were\nsomewhat successful in increasing use of the measures,\na significant gap still remained between knowledge and\nuse. It was proposed that ongoing support and opportu-\nnities to share experiences with peers may be necessary\nfor the clinical use of evidence-based measures to be\nmaintained long term.\nIn a clinical trial, mental health practitioners rando-\nmized to a‘community of practice’ group demonstrated\nmore frequent clinical use of an accepted standardized\nmeasure compared to those who had access only to\ntheir organizations’ regular supports [26]. Communities\nof practice may be an effective KT strategy to support\nuse of research evidence in clinical practice. In addition\nto the interactive aspect, this approach also involves\nindividuals from within the clinical practice setting.\nBecause barriers to using evidence in practice will vary\nby practice setting, having someone from within the\nclinical practice setting available to help identify both\nbarriers and supports would be important to influence\neffective KT strategies.\nA recent systematic review of strategies used by reha-\nbilitation professionals to move evidence into practice\nsuggested that active, multi -component interventions\nimprove evidence-based kno wledge and behaviours by\nP T s[ 2 7 ] .O n es t r a t e g yf o rk n o w l e d g et r a n s f e rt h a ti s\ngaining interest is a KT program built around the roles\nand activities of a knowledge broker (KB). A KB has\nbeen defined as someone who is capable of ‘bringing\nresearchers and decision makers together, facilitating\ntheir interaction so that they are able to better under-\nstand each others’ goals and professional culture, influ-\nence each others’ work, forge new partnerships, and use\nresearch-based evidence. Brokering is ultimately about\nsupporting evidence-based decision making in the orga-\nnization, management and delivery of health services ’\n[28]. Pediatric PTs in children’s rehabilitation settings\nshare common values, interests, and uncertainties about\ntheir work, and within these communities of practice\nthe role of the KB may be particularly useful.\nDespite the increasing interest in knowledge broker-\ning, little research evidence exists regarding the use of a\nKB. A common feature among different types of broker-\ning models is the concept of interactive engagement;\nhowever, the specific brokering activities of the KB are\ndifficult to define or standardize because the role should\nbe flexible and responsive to the needs of the stake-\nholders [29,30]. Most brokering studies to date have\nbeen in policy decision-maki ng environments [31-33].\nAlthough there is evidence that KBs help decision\nmakers gain knowledge and skills in the evidence-based\nprocess [32], Dobbins et al. [29] found that the use of a\nKB in addition to tailored messages linking relevant\nresearch evidence to specific decision makers was not as\neffective as tailored messages alone in influencing policy\ndecision making for public health organizations with a\nhigh research culture. These findings are useful; how-\never, the environments in which policy makers and\nfront-line clinicians practice are very different, as are the\nissues that they must address. Thus, investigation of a\nKB model in a clinical environment was warranted.\nThe primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the\nshort-term (six-month) and long-term (12-month)\nimpact of a multi-faceted KT intervention using KBs to\nfacilitate the use of four evidence-based measurement\ntools by PTs in children ’s rehabilitation facilities in\nOntario (the ‘East’), and Alberta and British Columbia\n(the ‘West’). A secondary purpose of the study was to\nexplore factors such as organizational support that\nmight modify or mediate the intervention.\nWe hypothesized that in both regions (East and West),\nPTs would increase their knowledge and use of the mea-\nsurement tools, but that there would be regional differ-\nences because of baseline differences in familiarity with\nthe tools between the regions. Therapists in the East\nhave a longstanding partnership with CanChild and\ntheir involvement in previous research related to the\ndevelopment and validation of the measurement tools\nmay provide them with more familiarity with the tools.\nThe natural variation between the regions enhances the\ngeneralizability of the intervention approach across set-\ntings, level of baseline knowledge, and use. We also\nhypothesized that organizational culture would influence\nthe uptake of evidence based on previous work [31,34].\nWe developed a KT model of a KB embedded within\nthe clinical context and supported by the network of\nknowledge brokers and the research team (including a\nbroker to the knowledge brokers). We refer to this as a\n‘broker to the knowledge brokers ’ model (Figure 2).\nThis model focused on the ‘action ’ or implementation\nphase of the knowledge to action (KTA) framework\n[35], with an emphasis on knowledge uptake rather than\non providing a synthesis of the evidence or on teaching\nclinicians to be experts in critical appraisal.\nMethods\nDesign\nA mixed methods, before-after study design was used to\nevaluate the impact of a six-month multi-faceted KB\nintervention on PTs’ self-reported knowledge and use of\nthe motor measurement tools measured using an on-\nline survey questionnaire. Follow-up questionnaire data\nwere collected from PTs immediately following the\nintervention (six months after baseline) and at 12 and\n18 months to examine the long-term impact. The KB\nRussell et al. Implementation Science 2010, 5:92\nhttp://www.implementationscience.com/content/5/1/92\nPage 3 of 17\nprocess was also evaluated using systematic documenta-\ntion of activities (log books) employed by KBs through-\nout the study, and semi-structured telephone interviews\nconducted with multiple stakeholders (KBs, PTs, and\norganization administrators) immediately post-interven-\ntion and one year later to evaluate the perceived utility\nof the KB intervention [36]. The focus of this paper is\non the questionnaire results on familiarity and use of\nthe measurement tools.\nSample size justification\nSample size calculations made prior to the study were\nbased on the power to detect change in the primary out-\ncome measure between any two of the intervention\npoints. Estimates were conservatively large, based on a\ntest-retest reliability of 0.50 (ICC), a strong cluster effect\ndue to centres (ICC = 0.20) and an average of three\ntherapists per centre, with a 5% Type I error rate. Vary-\ning these assumptions, it was estimated that we would\nhave at least 80% power to detect a standardized change\nof 0.19 standard deviations or more. The target number\nof PTs required (not including knowledge brokers) was\n90.\nSetting and participants\nChildren ’s rehabilitation organizations provide therapy\nservices (physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and\nspeech and language pathology) for children from birth\nto 19 years old with physical, developmental, and/or\ncommunication difficulties. Participating centres repre-\nsented both rural and urban settings and large and\nsmall centres. Organizations involved in this study pro-\nvided services to children in a variety of settings includ-\ning on site, in preschools and schools, at home, and in\nthe community. The administrators and PT managers of\n35 children’s rehabilitation organizations were invited to\nparticipate. The inclusion criteria specified the need to\nhave at least three PTs working at the site, in order to\nClinical Practice Site 1Clinical Practice Site 1\nKB\nPTs Admin\nNetwork of KBs\nMethodological\nexpertise\nClinical Practice Site 2Clinical Practice Site 2\nKB\nPTs Admin\nClinical Practice Site XClinical Practice Site X\nKB\nPTs Admin\nResearch TeamResearch Team\nBroker\nTo\nThe\nKBs\nContent\nexpertise\nKnowledge\nTranslation\nexpertise\nClinical\nexpertise\nKB\nKB\nKB\nSupports for KBs\nWorkshop\nTailored Resources\nIntranet discussion site\nTeleconferences\nPersonal communication\nFigure 2 A broker to the knowledge brokers (KB) model.

Three sites were very eager to participate but\ndid not have three PTs. Thesesites were subsequently\nincluded as ‘regional’ sites, using a KB from another par-\nticipating centre who agreed to broker to them in addi-\ntion to their own site. T wenty-eight children ’s\nrehabilitation organizations participated in the study,\nwith 16 centres in the East (Ontario), and 12 in the\nWest (two in Alberta, and 10 in British Columbia).\nTwenty-five pediatric PT KBs were recruited from\namong the staff at the participating sites. KBs applied,\nwere chosen, or volunteered for the role, based on a\nnumber of factors including their interest in and enthu-\nsiasm for the role, as well as their ability to adjust their\nschedule to accommodate the requirements of the study\n(two hours/week for six months). Twenty-four of the 25\nKBs remained in the study for the 18-month duration.\nOne KB in the West changed employment shortly after\nbaseline, and one of the KBs in geographic proximity\nagreed to become a regional broker for this site. KBs\nwere generally experienced clinicians with 19 (80%) hav-\ning 10 or more years working in childhood disability,\nand three (13%) having less than five years in pediatric\npractice. Sixteen KBs (67%) worked in urban settings\n(population >100,000) and spent, on average, 24% of\ntheir working time in direct patient care.\nThe target of the KB intervention was practicing PTs\nwho currently had (or anticipated having) at least three\nchildren with CP on their caseload during the six\nmonths of the brokering intervention. A total of 122\ntherapists consented to par ticipate and completed the\nbaseline questionnaire. Ninety (74%) PTs had five or\nmore years experience working in childhood disability,\nand 88 (72%) worked in urban centres with only one\ntherapist working in a remote area (population <3,000).\nPTs spent on average 53% of their time in direct care.\nTable 1 shows the demographic characteristics of the\nPTs and Table 2 details the number of therapists in\neach region who responded to the online survey ques-\ntionnaire at each of the four time points. Overall, 95\nPTs (78%) remained in the study for the 12-month fol-\nlow-up. The number of PTs brokered to at each site\nvaried, with one to two therapists at each of the three\nregional sites and three to nine therapists at the remain-\ning sites.\nIntervention\nThe intervention involved pediatric PT KBs situated in\nclinical sites who were supported by the network of KBs\nand the research team (Figure 2). Supports for the KBs\nincluded access to the study team and research coordi-\nnator, an experienced pediatric PT who had used the\nmeasurement tools clinically. The research coordinator\nfunctioned as a ‘broker to the knowledge brokers’ pro-\nviding timely responses to questions and encouraging\nlinkages both among KBs and between the KBs and the\nresearchers. Graham et al.’s KTA framework [35] was\nused to plan the intervention, including adapting knowl-\nedge to the local context; assessing barriers and sup-\nports; selecting, tailoring, and implementing\ninterventions; and monitoring use and evaluating out-\ncomes. Details of the study activities are described in\nTable 3. Supportive activities for the KBs included an\ninitial face-to-face one-day interactive workshop with\nKBs and the study team (many of whom were content\nexperts regarding the measurement tools). It is impor-\ntant to note that in the workshop KBs were not trained\non the measurement tools themselves but used small\ngroup sessions to discuss the roles and responsibilities\nof the KB and possible KT strategies. In addition, they\nwere provided with information about the central sup-\nports available to the KBs through the study team.\nIn preparation for the workshop, KBs completed a\nquestionnaire about the perceived supports and barriers\nto moving the measurement tools into practice at their\norganization. The questio nnaire was designed for this\nstudy and based on factors identified by Fleuren et al.\n[37] as important determinants of innovation in health-\ncare organizations. KBs reflected on perceived supports\nand barriers related to their organizational structure,\ntheir organizational resources, their target therapists, the\nchildren with CP and their families, and the measure-\nment tools themselves. KBs were provided with tailored\nresources related to the measurement tools (including\nuser-friendly evidence-based summaries and case sce-\nnarios, CD-ROM training materials, etc.) for use in the\nKBs’ own site. Rather than overwhelming the KBs with\nan abundance of information, a private intranet site was\nset up where additional materials (including prepared\nslide presentations) were posted for their use and modi-\nfication as needed. The types of supports and resources\naccessed by KBs during the study were left to the discre-\ntion of the KB based upon the needs and strengths of\nthe KB, their therapists, and their organization. A\ndetailed description of the strategies used and the\nresources accessed by KBs is reported elsewhere [36],\nbut consisted of activities such as self learning, needs\nassessments, presentations, group discussions, accessing\nand modifying resources, one-on-one interactions with\nvarious stakeholders, networking with other KBs, acces-\nsing computer support, and collaborative measurement\nand scoring of clients.\nOngoing collaboration amongst KBs was encouraged\nthrough an intranet discussion site that was monitored\nand moderated by members of the study team. Three\nKB teleconferences were held during the six-month\nintervention, providing opportunities for KBs to network\nRussell et al. Implementation Science 2010, 5:92\nhttp://www.implementationscience.com/content/5/1/92\nPage 5 of 17\nwith each other, and interface with the research team.\nRelease time for the KBs in the form of financial sup-\nport was provided to organizations for two hours per\nweek during the six-month intervention. KBs were able\nto use the two hours per week flexibly, depending upon\ntheir schedules ( e.g., not necessarily two hours every\nweek, but to average out to that amount over the six\nmonths).\nAt the end of the six-month brokering period, KBs\nparticipated in a face-to-face workshop to discuss preli-\nminary results, provide feedback on current brokering\nactivities, and identify next steps in the research process.\nEthics approval was obtained from research ethics\nboards at McMaster University, University of Alberta,\nUniversity of Calgary, and University of British Colum-\nbia. Informed consent was obtained from all participat-\ning KBs, PTs, and administrators.\nMeasures\nEvaluation of uptake of the measurement tools\nThe primary outcome was change in PTs’ self-reported\nknowledge and use of the measurement tools assessed\nTable 1 Demographic characteristics of physical therapists (PTs) (n = 122)\nn (%)\nProvince of Practice\nEast (Ontario) 71 (58.2)\nWest (Alberta and British Columbia) 51 (41.8)\nLength of employment at current practice site\nLess than 1 year 15 (12.3)\n1 year to <5 years 36 (29.5)\n5 years to < 10 years 21 (17.2)\n10 years or longer 50 (41.0)\nNumber of years working in childhood disability\nLess than 1 year 8 (6.6)\n1 year to <5years 24 (19.7)\n5 years to <10 years 29 (23.8)\n10 years or longer 61 (50.0)\nNumber of PTs contracted to work in other settings (with children with CP)\nCommunity-based 18 (14.8)\nCentre/facility-based 4 (3.3)\nNumber of PTs serving children in various age ranges (all settings)*\nBirth to <3 years 87 (71.3)\n3 years to <6 years 99 (81.1)\n6 years to <12 years 90 (73.4)\n12 years or older 79 (64.8)\nPercentage of time spent in direct care (mean, (SD)) 53.4 (25.1)\nGeographical region predominantly served\nUrban (population >100,000) 88 (72.1)\nRural (population between 3,000 and 99,999) 33 (27.0)\nRemote (population less than 3,000) 1 (0.8)\nNote: * PTs could be working with children in more than 1 age group;\nPT = physical therapist, CP = cerebral palsy, SD = standard deviation, n = number, % = percent of total\nTable 2 Number of completed therapist surveys by\nregion for each time point†\nBaseline 6 months 12 months 18 months\nEast 71 67 67 59\nWest 51 47 38 36\nTotal 122 114 105 95\n† Sample size reduced by therapists on leave, missing data\nRussell et al.

The questionnaire provided ratings of familiarity\nwith and use of the four measurement tools (GMFCS,\nGMFM-88, GMFM-66, Motor Growth Curves) assessed\non a 10-point Likert scale (from‘not at all’ to ‘to a great\nextent ’). Based on previous work evaluating measures\nand knowledge uptake [20,31], nine questions concern-\ning organizational support were included in the ques-\ntionnaire. The questionnaire was pilot-tested with 27\ntherapists and modified based on their feedback prior to\nits use in this study. Test-retest reliability of a Dutch\ntranslation of the questionnaire found item ICCs ran-\nging from 0.75 to 0.98 for items related to familiarity\nand use of the measurement tools and from 0.29 to 0.91\nfor organizational character istics (Ketelaar, personal\ncommunication).\nEvaluation of KB Process\nDuring the six-month intervention, KBs submitted a\nweekly log of their activities to the research coordinator.\nDuring the 12-month follow-up, KB logs were submitted\nmonthly to document the extent to which brokering\nactivities continued followi ng withdrawal of financial\nsupport for the role. The KBs documented the number\nand type of contacts (e.g., contact with PTs involved in\nthe study or others external to the study), who initiated\nthe contacts (e.g., the KB or someone from the centre),\nthe type of activity (educational session, case discussion),\nand the format of the activities ( e.g ., face-to-face\nmeeting, individual or group session). In addition they\ndocumented the supports they accessed (e.g., the intra-\nnet site, other KBs, technical support) and indicated any\nresources they developed (e.g., flyers, surveys).\nAnalysis\nEvaluation of uptake of the measurement tools\nTo examine uptake of the measurement tools by PTs,\neight outcomes were investigated and included‘familiar-\nity’ and ‘use’ for each of the four tools, scored on a 10-\npoint Likert scale. Because the data were not normally\ndistributed (some outcomes were bimodal, some\nseverely skewed) and to facilitate clinical interpretation,\nthe original 10-point scale was collapsed into three cate-\ngories (1 =‘none’;2t o7= ‘some’; 8 to 10 =‘high’; with\n‘some’ as the reference category). It was felt that moving\nfrom being a ‘non-user ’ of a measure to being a user\nwas a more significant change than a change of one or\ntwo points in original scale (i.e., a change in the original\nscale might be more difficult to interpret than a change\nbetween ‘levels ’ or categories of the outcome). Where\nthere were too few ‘none ’ responses, the ‘none ’ and\n‘some’ categories were combined.\nMixed-effects multinomial logistic regression was used\nwith the MIXNO program [38] to examine the impact\nof the intervention by making comparisons over time\nand investigating the effect of region (East or West) on\nthe outcomes. Multinomial, as opposed to ordinal\nTable 3 Design of knowledge brokering intervention (based on the KTA framework 35)\nPhase 1:\nAdapting knowledge to local context -\nKnowledge tools and products\nContent-specific materials synthesized, tailored for easy KB access\nPre-workshop package sent to KBs containing a GMFM-88/66 manual, instructional CD-ROM,\nGMFCS training DVD, key published articles, and user-friendly summaries and case scenarios\nAdditional materials posted on a private‘KB Discuss’ intranet site\nIntranet site designed so KBs could post and respond to questions - community of practice\nencouraged\nIntranet site moderated by research team\nPower-Point presentations about the measures made available for download (KBs encouraged to\nmodify and tailor)\nPhase 2:\nAssessing barriers and supports\nIn preparation for the KB interactive workshop, KBs completed a‘Supports and Barriers\nQuestionnaire’ to identify possible supports and barriers to implementation of the motor\nmeasures within their own clinical context.\nThey were asked to consider factors within their organizational structure and resources, the\ntarget therapists, the measures themselves, and the children and families\nPhase 3:\nSelecting, tailoring, and implementing\ninterventions\nKBs empowered to select, tailor, and implement interventions as they felt appropriate\nKBs tracked activities using a weekly log book\nRegular KB teleconferences and use of online‘KBdiscuss’ site facilitated sharing of strategies\nPhase 4:\nMonitoring use and evaluating outcomes\nKBs and PTs completed online survey of knowledge and use, pre-brokering, 6, 12, and 18\nmonths\nKBs, PTs, and centre administrators completed a semi-structured telephone interview about the\nutility of the KB process at 6 and 18 months\nRussell et al.

Therapists and site were\nmodelled as random effects and time and region were\nmodelled as fixed effects. Because each site had only a\nsingle KB, either site or KB could be included in the\nmodel, and we chose to include the site. The effect of\norganizational characteristics (overall culture and super-\nvisor expectation) was also investigated to determine if\nthey improved the model fit for the outcomes of\ninterest.\nOrganizational culture\nPTs answered nine questions about the organizational\ncharacteristics and culture towards research and evi-\ndence-based practice within their organizations. Each\nquestion was scored on a 10-point scale with response\noptions ranging from ‘n o ta ta l l’ to ‘to a great extent.’\nFactor analysis of the items was done to determine\nwhether it would be appropriate to combine items into\na separate overall‘organizational culture’ score.\nSensitivity analysis\nTo determine the potential impact of data collected\nfrom PTs who were away or on leave for more than one\nmonth during the study period, a sensitivity analysis was\ncompleted omitting those PTs (n = 27) from the analy-\nsis. Overall, there were no important differences in the\nresults with the data from these PTs removed; therefore\nall data were included in the final analyses.\nResults\nFamiliarity and use of the motor measurement tools\nA description of the four measurement tools and their\nmeasurement characteristics is outlined in an Addi-\ntional file 1, Table S1. The measurement tools have\nbeen developed, validated, and published over the past\n20 years and vary in their complexity to learn and use.\nStacked bar graphs displaying the results are shown in\nFigures 3, 4, 5, and 6. The conditional odds ratios for\neach of the measurement tools (GMFCS, GMFM-88,\nGMFM-66, MGCs), by region over time for the out-\ncomes ‘familiarity ’ and ‘use,’ are presented in Tables 4,\n5, 6, and 7. When a time by region interaction was\nidentified, separate results for East and West are pre-\nsented; otherwise the data are combined across\nregions. A few results ( e.g ., in Tables 4 and 6) show\nhigh odds ratios with very wide confidence intervals;\nthe instability of these results is due to the small num-\nber of therapists in the West who reported high famil-\niarity at baseline.\nFamiliarity and Use of the GMFCS\nThe GMFCS is a five-level severity classification system\nand is the easiest of the measurement tools to learn and\nto use. It can be used by rehabilitation service providers\nother than PTs and may therefore be of interest to\nother clinicians and administrators in children’s rehabili-\ntation organizations.\nThe GMFCS was the most familiar of the four mea-\nsurement tools to therapists in both regions. Therapist\nreported familiarity and use of the GMFCS over time is\ndisplayed in Figure 3. At baseline, 70 (99%) PTs in the\nEast reported having at least some familiarity with the\nGMFCS and 65 (92%) reported having used it. Following\nthe six-month intervention , all therapists in the East\nwere familiar with the GMFCS and all reported using it\nat least once. High users increased from 55 to 84%.\nIn the West, there was a wider gap between familiarity\nand use of the GMFCS than in the East, with 39 (77%)\nPTs reporting at least some familiarity with the GMFCS\nat baseline, and 27 (53%) PTs indicating that they had\nused it at least once. Immediately post-intervention, all\ntherapists in the West were familiar with the GMFCS\nand overall use in the West increased from 53% to 85%,\nwith high users increasing from 14% to 51%.\nThe conditional odds ratios for familiarity and use of\nthe GMFCS are presented in Table 4. There was a time\nby region interaction for familiarity and therefore results\nare presented separately for the East and the West.\nBecause there were so few therapists who were not at\nall familiar with the GMFCS, results for‘no familiarity’\nwere combined with ‘some familiarity’ and compared to\n‘high ’ familiarity. There was a significant increase in\ntherapists ’ familiarity with the GMFCS at six months\ncompared to baseline (odds ratios of having‘high famil-\niarity ’ versus ‘some familiarity ’ was 7.2 (95% CI: 2.0 to\n25.9) in the East and 378.1 (95% CI 12.2 to 11676.1) in\nthe West. The high odds ratio with very wide confi-\ndence intervals in the West is due to the small number\nof therapists in the West who reported high familiarity\nat baseline. Results also show that the odds ratios did\nnot change significantly in the 6- or 12-month follow-\nup, indicating that the change from baseline was\nmaintained.\nLooking at GMFCS use there was no interaction so\nresults for East and West are combined. The odds ratio\nof moving from‘no use’ to ‘some use’ was 11.8 (95% CI\n2.4 to 57.7) and from ‘some use ’ to ‘high use ’ of the\nGMFCS following the intervention was 18.2 (95% CI 5.5\nto 60.1). Changes in GMFCS use were maintained at 6\nand 12 months. Therapists in the East were 17 times\nmore likely to report high use relative to those in the\nWest and 15 times more likely to report using it‘some’\nthan not using it at all compared to therapists in the\nWest.\nFamiliarity and use of the GMFM-88\nThe GMFM-88 was first published in 1989 and is used\nto evaluate change in the gross motor abilities of chil-\ndren with CP. Although the GMFM-88 provides a\nRussell et al. Implementation Science 2010, 5:92\nhttp://www.implementationscience.com/content/5/1/92\nPage 8 of 17\ndetailed assessment of gross motor skills, it takes time to\nlearn to administer and score its 88 items (e.g., typically\nseveral hours of reading and practicing). In addition,\nadministering the test with children usually takes 45 to\n60 minutes.\nAt baseline, therapists in the East were very familiar\nwith the GMFM-88, with 69 (97%) PTs reporting they\nwere at least somewhat familiar with the GMFM-88,\nand 50 (70%) indicating that they were highly familiar\n(Figure 4).

Despite\nthis, only 35 (49%) therapists reported using it. Immedi-\nately post-intervention, there was a significant increase\nin the number of therapists indicating they were using\nthe GMFM-66, with 30 (45%) reporting having used it\nat least once and an additional 24 (36%) reporting high\nuse.\nAt baseline, 30 (59%) PTs in the West indicated at\nleast some familiarity with the GMFM-66 while 11\n(22%) indicated they were using it. Immediately post-\nintervention, 46 (98%) PTs indicated they were familiar\nwith the GMFM-66, and overall users increased to 31\n( 6 6 % )w i t hh i g hu s e r si n c r e a s i n gf r o m2( 4 % )t o1 2\n(26%). Conditional odds ratios for change in familiarity\nand use of the GMFM-66 are presented in Table 6.\nFamiliarity and use of the motor growth curves\nThe Motor Growth Curves were originally developed by\ntracking a large number of children with CP over time\nusing both the GMFCS and the GMFM-66. These\ncurves describe patterns of motor development over\ntime and allow users to predict a child’s future motor\nabilities, given the child’s current age and GMFCS level.\nThe motor growth curves are the most recent of the\nmeasurement tools, and PTs have had the least amount\nof time to become comfortable with their use and\ninterpretation.\nAlthough 50 (70%) therapists in the East indicated\nthat they had at least some familiarity with the Motor\nGrowth Curves, only 28 (39%) reported using them (Fig-\nure 6). Immediately post-intervention all but one PT in\nthe East indicated they were familiar with the Motor\nGrowth Curves and 51 (76%) indicated they used them.\nS i x t e e n( 3 1 % )P T si nt h eW e s th a ds o m ef a m i l i a r i t y\nwith the Motor Growth Curves at baseline and only\nfour (8%) indicated using them. Immediately post-inter-\nvention, familiarity had increased, with 45 (96%) of the\nPTs in the West reporting familiarity and 14 (30%)\nreporting using them at least once with a further 11\n(24%) reporting high use. Conditional odds ratios for\nchange in familiarity and use of the Motor Growth\nCurves are presented in Table 7.\nLong-term impact\nThe increased familiarity with all the measurement tools\nreported immediately following the intervention was\nsustained one year later. With the exception of the\nGMFM-88, reported use of the tools also increased and\nthe effect remained one year later. Because the GMFM-\n66 was an improvement to the GMFM-88, therapists\nwho were not familiar with the GMFM-88 would likely\ngo straight to learning and using the GMFM-66. On the\nother hand, therapists fa miliar with the GMFM-88\nm i g h th a v ec o n t i n u e dt ou s ei tb e c a u s et h e r es t i l la r e\nindications for use of the GMFM-88 to provide a more\ndetailed assessment of certain children.\nRegional differences\nThe results indicate that therapists in the East reported\ngreater familiarity and use of the measurement tools at\nbaseline than those in the West, but the intervention\nstill had a significant impact on therapists in both\nregions. Familiarity with the tools improved significantly\nfollowing the intervention for both regions. For the\nGMFCS and the GMFM-66 a time by region interaction\nwas found indicating that the change in familiarity was\nsignificantly greater in the West. In terms of using the\nmeasurement tools, PTs in the East were more likely\nthan PTs in the West to report high use of the GMFCS\n(OR = 17.7, 95% CI 4.1 to 76.3) and GMFM-88 (OR =\n84.7, 95% CI 11.1 to 644.8), but this was not statistically\nsignificant for the GMFM-66 (OR = 1.8; 95% CI 0.6 to\n5.3) or the MGCs (OR = 0.4; 95% CI 0.1 to 1.1). PTs in\nt h eE a s tw e r em o r el i k e l yt h a nt h o s ei nt h eW e s tt o\nreport using the tools at least some of the time: GMFCS\n(OR = 15.0; 95% CI 1.7 to 134.3), GMFM-88 (OR =\n13.1; 95% CI 4.5 to 38.3), GMFM-66 (OR = 3.3; 95% CI\n1.5 to 7.4) and the MGCs (OR = 9.9; 95% CI 2.5 to\n39.2).\nOrganizational characteristics\nTable 8 contains details of t he descriptive statistics\n(mean, median) and factor loadings related to organiza-\ntional characteristics and culture towards research, mea-\nsurement and evidence-based practice. Factor analysis of\nthe nine items produced a three-factor solution with a\ncombined explained variation of 72%. The final question\nregarding organizational resistance to change was a\nnoisy item with explained variation of only 18%; it was\nsubsequently removed and the factor analysis repeated.\nThe factor analysis yielded the following three main\nfactors: research culture, resources, and supervisor\nexpectation accounting for 78.8% of the total variation.\nThese factors were then included in the models for each\noutcome and a likelihood ratio test was used to deter-\nmine if their presence improved the model. The\n‘resource’ factor was not significant for any of the mea-\nsurement tools and was therefore dropped from the\nmodels. Research culture and supervisor expectation\nwere added as fixed effects in the models for the eight\noutcomes of familiarity and use of the GMFCS, GMFM-\n88, GMFM-66, and the MGCs for both East and West\nsettings to investigate the impact of these factors on the\noverall results.\nResearch culture of the organization had a significant\nimpact on GMFCS familiarity over the six-month inter-\nvention (OR = 3.6, 95% CI 1.5 to 8.7) (Table 4). Both\nresearch culture (OR = 3.0, 95% CI 1.1 to 7.9) and\nRussell et al. Implementation Science 2010, 5:92\nhttp://www.implementationscience.com/content/5/1/92\nPage 13 of 17\nsupervisor expectation for use of measurement tools\n(OR = 2.6, 95% CI 1.1 to 6.0) were significant predictors\nin explaining changes in reported use of the GMFCS\nfrom ‘none’ to ‘some’ and supervisor expectation (OR =\n2.0, 95% CI 1.0 to 3.9) when examining the difference\nbetween ‘some ’ versus ‘high ’ use. The organizational\ncharacteristics did not have a significant impact on the\nchange in familiarity and use of the other tools.\nDiscussion\nT h i si st h ef i r s ts t u d yw ea r ea w a r eo fw h i c he v a l u a t e s\nthe impact of a multi-faceted KB intervention to help\nbridge the evidence to practice gap within children ’s\nrehabilitation organizations. Following a six-month (two\nhours/week) KB intervention, changes were reported in\npracticing PTs’ self-reported familiarity with and use of\nfour specific evidence-based measurement tools in two\nregions of Canada. The changes were maintained one\nyear later. These results are in line with those of a\nrecent systematic review of KT interventions for rehabi-\nlitation professionals (OT and PTs) that found moderate\nlevel evidence that active multi-component KT interven-\ntions (i.e., combination of opinion leaders, outreach vis-\nits, working groups, printed materials) improved\nknowledge and practice behaviours compared with pas-\nsive dissemination strategies for PTs [27].\nHow our results fit with those of Dobbinset al. [31] is\nless clear. Their randomized control trial involved three\nKT intervention groups moving from the most passive\n(access to on-line systematic reviews through healthevi-\ndence.ca, or HE), to a moderately interactive KT strategy\n(access to HE plus receiving tailored, targeted messages,\nor TM), and the most interactive (HE plus TM plus\nKBs). There was no significant effect of the intervention\nf o ra n yo ft h eg r o u p so nt h ep r i m a r yo u t c o m eo fu s i n g\nevidence in program decisions; however, there was an\neffect on public health policies and programs for deci-\nsion makers receiving the moderately interactive\napproach of HE plus TM. The addition of the KB\nseemed to wash out the effect of the HE plus TM strat-\negy. Support for the HE plus TM plus KB was found\nonly in those departments where the organizational cul-\nture for research was low. Our results showed that a\nstrong research culture and supervisor expectations\nwere the significant factors in predicting familiarity and\nuse of only one of our measurement tools, the GMFCS.\nThe GMFCS is used not only by PTs but by other clini-\ncians as well, and therefore PTs might have had greater\nexpectations to use this tool, especially when communi-\ncating with other service providers. Availability of orga-\nnizational resources were not observed to have a\nsignificant impact on familiarity or use of the measure-\nment tools, perhaps because the study team provided\neducational resources (manuals, CD-ROM training) and\nfinancial remuneration for the KBs. The target in the\nDobbins study [31] was on individual decision makers in\nTable 8 Descriptive statistics of organizational characteristics as perceived by individual physical therapists at baseline\n(n = 122)\nFactor Loadings\nOrganizational characteristics: survey itemsa Mean\n(SD)b\nMedian Resources Culture Supervisor\nI have access to someone within my organization who can help me to interpret or utilize\nresearch evidence\n6.1 (2.9) 6 0.62 0.34 nil\nMy organization supports and/or provides ongoing training in the use of standardized\nmeasures\n6.1 (2.6) 7 0.76 0.21 0.19\nMechanisms exist in my organization that facilitate the transfer of research evidence into my\norganization\n5.2 (2.6) 5 0.85 0.29 0.21\nOverall my organization provides adequate resources (financial or personnel) to implement\ndecisions that are based on research evidence\n5.0 (2.4) 5 0.78 0.34 0.26\nI frequently hear the terms‘research’ or ‘research evidence’ during policy or program\nplanning discussions within my organization\n6.2 (2.4) 7 0.31 0.82 0.23\nOverall the culture in my organization is one that highly values the use of research evidence\nin decision-making for program planning\n6.6 (2.5) 7 0.37 0.79 0.29\nResearch evidence is consistently included in the decision-making process related to program\nplanning in my organization\n5.5 (2.3) 6 0.41 0.71 0.41\nMy direct supervisor expects me to include research evidence in decision-making related to\nprogram planning\n5.5 (2.6) 6 0.28 0.50 0.83\nAt my organization, resistance to change is a barrier to using research evidence 3.4 (2.5) 3 removed\na Items were scored on a 10-point scale from 1 =‘not at all’ to 10 =‘to a great extent’\nb Standard deviation of the mean\nFactor analysis produced a 3-factor solution explaining 72% of the variance.

An important detail is that the KB was not\nsituated in the public health departments, and 30% of\nthe health departments never received any of the bro-\nkering intervention. In contrast, our study was focused\nprimarily on the implementa tion of specific evidence-\nbased measurement tools by KBs embedded in the clini-\ncal sites on knowledge and on use by practicing clini-\ncians, rather than capacity building which would take\nlonger to show an impact. A large component of our\nstudy was the multiple supports offered to KBs through-\nout the intervention, including facilitation of a KB com-\nmunity of practice, which is thought to be an important\ncomponent of KT interventions [25,26,31].\nThe KB model employed in this study was designed to\naddress many of the barriers to knowledge transfer iden-\ntified in the literature, and was primarily focused on the\n‘action ’ phase of moving evidence into practice. An\nattempt was made to minimize potential barriers by:\nobtaining support from organizations prior to imple-\nmenting the KB model; engaging KBs who were enthu-\nsiastic about the role; providing financial support to\neach of the rehabilitation organizations to allow for\ndedicated time for the KB role; limiting the content to\nfour measurement tools relevant to clinical practice;\nproviding tailored, synthesized materials and training\nresources in a variety of formats; and providing a social\nnetwork of support to the KBs comprised of other KBs\nand the research study team. To implement this KB\nmodel in practice without having the evidence synthe-\nsized in user-friendly formats would require significantly\nmore time and resources than were provided in this\nstudy. This underscores the need for researchers to\ndevote more time to describing and highlighting impli-\ncations for practice, and to packaging their research\nmaterials in ways that make them accessible to front-\nline practitioners. In addition, academic institutions\nneed to acknowledge the importance of KT activities\nand to value them in decisions of academic promotion\nand tenure.\nThroughout the study KBs identified the significance\nof the PT research coordinator or‘broker to the KBs’ as\nbeing an important facilitator of the process. The\nresearch coordinator readily understood the therapists’\nneeds, responded in a timely fashion to KBs requests for\nhelp or information and was in contact on a regular\nbasis throughout the intervention with KBs and the\nstudy team [36].\nKetelaar et al. [25] have demonstrated the knowledge/\nuse gap with a subset of these measurement tools with\nPTs in the Netherlands. In our study, therapists from\nthe West tended to have a wider gap between familiarity\nand use of measurement tools at baseline than those in\nthe East, and this KB strategy helped to narrow the gap\nconsiderably. Changes reported in rehabilitation organi-\nzations across the three provinces imply that the model\ncan be generalized across different practice settings\nbecause clinicians provided service to children of all\nages, practiced in urban and rural settings, and had\nvarying levels of baseline knowledge. It is encouraging\nthat the changes reported immediately post-intervention\nwere maintained one year later.\nA success of this intervention was the high retention\nrate of 24 out of 25 KBs (96%) and 114 of 122 (93%)\nparticipating therapists through the six-month interven-\ntion. This is an indication of the interest and enthusiasm\nthat was generated for this KB process.\nLimitations\nA before-after research design does not provide a con-\ncurrent control group for comparison. However, the\ntools we evaluated have been published and available to\nservice providers for several years through traditional\ndissemination methods (journal articles, books, work-\nshops, and the internet), and they are still not routinely\nbeing used in clinical practice. We therefore felt that we\nhad a stable baseline from which to make a comparison\nover time with each site acting as its own control.\nThe sample size for this study was estimated based on\nchange on the 10-point Likert scale of the survey ques-\ntionnaire. To facilitate clinical interpretation of the scale\nand because the data were not normally distributed, the\n10-point scale was collapsed into three categories. The\nlack of precision in some of our odds ratio estimates\nmay have been limited by our sample size.\nThere is a need for reliable and valid outcome mea-\nsures to evaluate the impact of KT interventions and to\nidentify and document supports and barriers to imple-\nmentation. The primary outcome measure in this study\nwas a survey questionnaire used to evaluate PTs’ self-\nreported knowledge of and use of four specific measure-\nment tools. Self-report measures can lead to an over-\nreporting bias [39]. It would have been useful to validate\nthe reported use in our study through a chart audit.\nBarwick et al. [26] found no difference in reported use\nof measures between a community of practice group\nand a control group, but did find a difference in actual\nuse in the community of practice group as measured\nthrough chart audit.\nIdeally it would also be important to determine\nwhether the observed changes in knowledge and use of\nthe measurement tools impacted child and family out-\ncomes. Through this study KBs and PTs identified an\nadditional barrier that would be important to address\nprior to looking at the impact on child and family out-\ncomes. They sometimes found it challenging to commu-\nnicate the results from these measurement tools with\nRussell et al. Implementation Science 2010, 5:92\nhttp://www.implementationscience.com/content/5/1/92\nPage 15 of 17\nfamilies, particularly ‘classifying children,’ sharing prog-\nnostic information with families at a time when families\nwere ‘ready ’ to hear the information, and presenting\nresults in a sensitive manner while supporting families\nto maintain hope. This information will be useful for\ndeveloping further resources for therapists and families\nto help address this important barrier.\nSummary\nThis multi-centre study showed that by providing mod-\nest financial remunerati on (two hours/week for six\nmonths), ongoing resource materials, and personal and\nintranet support, a KB embedded within a clinical site\nwas effective in increasing self-reported knowledge and\nuse of specific evidence-based measurement tools. These\nreported changes were sustained at 12 months. Because\nthe study provided many supports to the organizations,\nfurther research is warranted into understanding feasi-\nble, cost effective models for implementing a KB strat-\negy to move other measures and evidence based\ninformation into clinical practice.\nAdditional material\nAdditional file 1: Table S1: Characteristics of the Motor Growth\nMeasures.
