INTRODUCTION \nVision transformers (ViTs ) were first proposed for the \nmachine translation task in the Natural Language Processing \nNLP domain. The transformer -based methods have \naccomplished innovative performance in a variety of tasks \n[1]. The ViT's disadvantage is that it necessitates pre,-training \non its larg,e ,dataset, [2 -4]. Transformers have been widely \nused in numerous vision problems, especially for visual \nrecognition and detection [5].  \nThe pioneering work of Swin Transformer [6]  has two \noutstanding and effective contributions that distinguish it \nfrom other transformers : \na) The feature hierarchical scheme offers outstanding \nperformance in terms of computational complexity. It is \nlinear, and for this feature (ST) is the backbone of (CV) \ntasks. \nb) The second advantage of ST is that it proposes a design \nequipped with variable -size windows between layers for \nsuccessive attention, and this improves the power of the \nmodeling [7]. \nThe model proposed by Gu. Yeonghyeon et al  [8] \nSTHarDNet, which combines the blocks of Swin adapters \nwith U -Net, is light in weight because it contains. The \nproposed model was used in the segmentation of MRI images \ntaken to diagnose stroke, and it gave superior results. The \nSwin was used in the first communication layer in the \nencryption stage to preserve the features of the Swin \nhierarchical switch STHarDNet is similar to the CNN model \nin that it takes into account the constraints and completes the \ntask, therefore it is considered the best. \nLiao. Zhihao .el.at [9] The Swin-PANet model is proposed as \na window-dependent self,-attention mechanis.m using ST in \nthe intermediate supervision network, which has been called \nthe Prior Attention Network. In this case, there was an \nincrease in the improvement of the details in the limits, and \nthe proposed Swin- PANet was used to diagnose skin cancer, \nand it gave efficient results in improving the accuracy of \nsegmentation and outperformed the modern models, but \ndespite that, it still suffers from a set of limitations, for \nexample, the ability to transfer learning . \nL. Jingyun et al  [10] proposed a powerful basic image \nrecovery model based on the Swin Transformer named \nSwinIR. The proposed model consists of three parts, firstly \nextracting shallow features, secondly extracting deep \nfeatures, and finally creating HR modules for re -basis, \nSwinIR achieved superior image recovery performance in \nthese three tasks and six different settings. namely: “classic \nimage SR”, grayscale image denoising, RGB image \nAbstract There are big differences between the field of view of the calculator and the field of natural \nlanguages, for example, in the field of vision, the difference is in the size of the object as well as in the \naccuracy of the pixels in the image, and this contradicts the words in the text, and this makes the adaptation \nof the transformers to see somewhat difficult .Very recently a vision transformer named Swin Transformer \nwas introduced by the Microsoft research team in Asia to achieve state -of-the-art results for machine \ntranslation. The computational complexity is linear and proportional to the size of the input image, because \nthe processing of subjective attention is within each local window separately, and thus results in processor \nmaps that are hierarchical and in deeper l ayers, and thus serve as the backbone of the calculator's vision in \nimage classification and dense recognition applications. This work focuses on applying the Swin \ntransformer to a demonstrated mathematical example with step -by-step analysis. Additionally,  extensive \nexperimental results were carried out on several standardized databases from CIFAR -10, CIFAR-100, and \nMNIST.

Siyuan et al [11] proposed a new method for classifying \nremote sensing images called (TSTNet), which is a two -\nstream network using Swin   transformer, and which was used \nfor each stream and considered the basis for it. \n  Thus, when comparing the performance of the proposed \nnetwork with modern models, it was found that the network \ngives good performance by classifying on a difficult and \navailable data set. \nA. Hatamizadeh et al [12] reformulated the problem semantic \nsegmentation of 3D \"brain tumor\" as a Seq-to-Seq prediction \nissue by developing the Swin UNEt TRansformers (Swin \nUNETR) model. In this model, the input data of multi-modal \nwas converted onto a 1D embedding sequence and utilized as \nthe input to a hierarchical ST representing the encoder. In the \nvalidation phase, this model was listed among the top -\nperforming techniques, and in the t esting phase, it displayed \ncompetitive performance.  \nThis paper will cast as a specific case of extending the “self -\nattentio,n mechanism” of the Swin Transformer by \ndemonstrating its performance on a given matrix. It will \nanalyze the intermediate results and explains the arbitrary \nrelations between any two e lements of the input during the \nimplementations. In addition, it will explore the work on \nmodeling labeled and directed graphs. On the three tasks, the \nSwin Transformer performance architecture was compared to \nthe past “state -of-the-art”. Several experimen ts were \nconducted on “CIFAR -,10”, “CIFAR -,100”, and “MNIST” \nfor image classification. The paper was organized into five \nsections: the second section covers the implantation of the \nSwin Transformer Block. ,Section 3 elucidates the \napplication of the Swin transform, s ection’ 4 states the \nresults, and the final section demonstrates several \nconclusions. \n2. BASIC CONCEPT OF A TRANSFORMER \nThe main structure of any Transformer [6-8] uses an encoder-\ndecoder structure where we note the use of layers in both \nencoder and decoder as shown in Figure 1 \nThe encryption layer also contains two important sub-layers: \nfirst, the self -attention, and second, the position -wise feed-\nforward layer. On the other hand, the decoding layer contains \nthree sub-layers:1) self-attention,layer, 2) ‘encoder’ -decoder \nattention, and 3) a ‘positio,n -wise feed’-,forward layer. The \ntransformers in general use a special type of connection \naround each of the sub -layers called residual connections. In \naddition, it uses an essential process known as  layer \nnormalization. One of the important stages in the structure of \ntransformers is the masking in the decoder. This masking \nwhich uses self -attention prevents a given output position \nfrom incorporating information about future output positions \nduring training. Both the input components of the  encoder \nand the decoder are locally encoded based on sinusoids at \ndifferent frequencies and all this is before entering the first \nlayer and therefore useful in making the model generalizable \nduring training, and also helps the model to learn by relative \nposition and when comparing this property with \nrepresentations Relative position is paradoxical because the \nrelative position of its representations is fixed and this, of \ncourse, helps spread the location information to other higher \nlayers. \n \nFigure 1: Transformer main blocks \n3. THE SHIFTED WINDOW \nTRANSFORMER (ST) \n     Shifted Window Transformer or Swin transformer (ST) \nconstructs hierarchical feature maps of the image by \ncombining their patches into deeper layers. The shifted \nwindowing scheme brings greater efficiency by limiting self-\nattention computation to non -overlapping local windows as \nwell as allowing the cross -window connection. The cost is \ncomputationally linear because the processing of self -\nattention within each local window is proportional to the size \nof the image entered. T hus, it generates feature maps with a \nsingle low resolution in comparison with earlier vision \n\n \n \nRasha. A. Dihin,  Ebtesam N. Al Shemmary, Waleed Ameen Al Jawher, 2023.  Implementation Of The Swin Transformer and Its Application In Image \nClassification. Journal port Science Research, 6(4), pp. 318-331. https://doi.org/10.36371/port.2023.4.2         \n320 \nJournal port Science Research \nAvailable online www.jport.co \nVolume 6, No:4. 2023 \n  \ntransformers. Therefore, it can serve as a foundation for \nimage and texture categorization, and speech processing \nalgorithms. There are many Challenges in Vision \nApplications using the Shifted Window Transformer. \nTransformer-based models are all set tokens  in size and may \ntherefore be inappropriate for some CV applications \nThe resolution  of the pixels in the images is higher than the \nwords in the text segments, and this is another variation \nbetween CV and NLP. The last difference is that some CV \ntasks may require detailed predictions at the pixel level. For \nexample, semanti c segmentation is not possible in high -\nresolution images because it causes quadratic computational \ncomplexity. As a solution, the Microsoft research team in \nAsia presents the Swin transformer as a general -purpose \nTransformer foundation that creates deep network maps. The \nhierarchical diagram of the Swin Transformer is given in \nFigure 2. \nFigure 2 shows how ST builds a hierarchical representation \nby starting with tinypatches and then merging these \nneighboring patches to get deeper layers. \nWhere by using these feature maps that are hierarchical, the \ncomputational complexity is linear so that it divides the image \ninto non -overlapping windows, as well as the number of \ncorrections is constant, unlike other transformers, which are \ndistinguished maps with one precision and therefore the \ncomputational complexity is quadratic \n \nFigure 2: The Hierarchical of the Swin Transformer \n4. STRUCTURE DESIGN \nMoving the window between successive ST self -attention \nlevels switches to final layer windows. This key feature of the \nST greatly enhances modeling capabilities and because all \nquery patches that are inside the window share the same key \nset, this simplifie s access to device memory [6]. Figure 3 \nshows the architecture of the ST in its simplest form. The \ninput RGB image is split into several nonn -overlapping, \npatches using the patch splitter used in ViT,  where each patch \nis treated as a \"token\", where individual pixels are set to be a \nsequence of “RGB” values. \nThe input image is routed via the patch partition layer and \nsplit into patchess of size 4x4 to create patch tokens with the \nshape (W/4, H/4, and 4x4 channel). In stage 1, the resulting \npatch tokens are subjected to linear embedding. They are then \nfed into two linked ST blocks to make tokens of (W/4, H/4, \nC), where C may be any dimension. Patch merging and Swin \ntransformer blocks are used in stages 2, 3, and 4, respectively. \nIn stages 2, 3, and 4, the shape of the tokens is (W1/81, H1/81, \n2C),(W1/161, H1/161 , 4C1), and (W1/321, H1/321, 8C1) \nrespectively. \nSwin Transformer can be created using transformed \nwindows. The normal multi -headed self -attention unit has \nbeen replaced. The rest of the layers remain the same. This \nlayer is followed by a non-linear unit of Gaussian error. Next, \nLayer normalization is applied before each multi-head self. -\nattention module. Finally, a residual connection is applied \nafter each of the above modules mentioned before.  \n\n \n \nRasha. A. Dihin,  Ebtesam N. Al Shemmary, Waleed Ameen Al Jawher, 2023.

The \nfirst Swin Transformer (Swin-T) block module uses \n a regular window partitioning designing. The next block \nadopts a shifted window partitioning strategy, while the first \nregular block partitioning begins from the top -left pixel [3], \n[11]. Hence the 8x8 given feature map is evenly divided into \n2x2 windows with 4x4 items each, as illustrated in Figure 3.  \nEach patch is called a “token” with a size of 4x4x3=48 pixels, \nwhere 3 is for the RGB channel and 4 is the height and width \nof the square patch, as shown in Figure 5. In patch partition, \nif M=4, if matrix 8*8, the patch=64. After patch partition, the \nsize of the image will become: \nSize of image = 2 x 2 x 48,   \n𝐻\n4 ×\n𝑊\n4 ×  𝐶 = \n8\n4 ∗\n8\n4 ∗ 48 = 192 \nThen, the number of channels will be converted from 48 to C \nthrough a full link layer, also known as the Linear Embedding \nlayer. After finishing the patch, it will go through Linear \nEmbedding [13]. \n\n \n \nRasha. A. Dihin,  Ebtesam N. Al Shemmary, Waleed Ameen Al Jawher, 2023.

Figure 6 shows how each 4x4 pixel (3 \nchannels) is flattened into 1x1 patches (48 channels). The \nmatrix R with 8x8 pixels (3 channels) is processed in this \nway, then (2, 2) patches, 48 channels, and a feature map with \nthe size of (2, 2, 48) will be received, (see the second \nstereogram with the green part in Figure 6). Input features (W \n/ 8 × H / 8 × 8C1) apply a linear layer to it, so to increase the \ndimensions of this feature to 2 × the original dimension   to \n((21× the original dimension1)) (W/8×H/8×8C). To expand \nthe accuracy of the features of entering to (W,/8×H1/8×8C) \nand reduce the dimension to a quarter of the input dimension \n(W1/8×H1/8×2C → W/4×H/4×C), the scientific order is \nrearranged.Patch partition and Linear Embedding are directly \ncombined into one, a convolution core with a size of 4x4, and \na stripe of 4 that is used directly to convert the number of \nchannels from 3 to C. \nStep 4: The matrix R in stage 2 is shown in Figure 7 Number \nof symbols reduced by a multiple of 2x21 = 4 (2x precision \ndownsampling).The output from it is set to 2C. feature \ntransformation used with Swin transformer blocks with the \nresolution remaining at:  \n𝐻\n8 ∗\n𝑊\n8 ∗ 2𝐶, for matrix R  \n8\n8 ∗\n8\n8 ∗ 2 ∗\n48 = 1 ∗ 1 ∗ 96 = 96. \nAssuming the input patch merging is an 8x8 single -channel \nfeature map (feature map), Patch Merging will divide each \n4x4 adjacent pixel into a patch, and then divide the same \nposition in each patch (the same Color) pixels into 4 feature \nmaps (putting them together). The depth of the feature map is \nchanged from C to 2C. This basic example shows that after \ngoing through the patch merging layer, the height and width \nof the feature map are halved, but the depth is doubled. To \nreduce the resolution, adjust the number of channels used, and \ncomplete the hierarchical design of the ST, merge correction \nwas used [14]. In this case, each downsample is two, and \nelements are chosen at every other point in the row and \ncolumn directions before being spliced together to expand, as \nseen in Figure 8. Next, apply the Swin transformer block to \nthe result. \n \nFigure 6: Stage 1 representation. \n \nFigure 7: Stage 2 representation \n\n \n \nRasha. A. Dihin,  Ebtesam N.

The batched block may be formed of \nmany sub-blocks that are not contiguous to the feature maps \nafter the cyclic shift; hence, Within each sub -block to \ndetermine to limit  \"self -attention\" a technique called \nMasking  is used  . The cyclic shift maintains the same \nnumbers of the batched blocks  as standard block splitting \nwhile still being computationally efficient, as seen in Figure \n16.

Equation 7 applies the LN \nover each sample z ∈ Rd, as shown in Figure 20 as follows \n[17],[18]: \n𝐿𝑁(𝑧) =\n𝑧−𝜇\n𝛿 °𝛾 + 𝛽                   (7) \n \n \nFigure 20: The LN(z) Computation. \nWhere: \n• µ’ ∈ R, δ ∈ R: is the feature's mean and standard \ndeviation, respectively.  \n• (◦): is the “element-wise dot”,  \n• γ' ∈ Rd, β ∈ Rd: are affine transform parameters that can \nbe learned, where γ refers to gain (scale factor) and β \nrefers to biases (offset) the value initialize β equals 0 \nvalue initialize γ equals 1 and if the affine transform = \ntrue.  \n• Now, to compute 𝜇 in LN apply the Equation 8 as \nfollows [18]: \n         𝜇 =\n1\n𝑚 ∑ 𝑧𝑖,𝑗\n𝑚\n𝑗=1                            (8)   \n• To compute δ apply Equation 9 as follows [19]: \n         σ =\n1\nm\n√(∑ zI,j − μI,j\nm\nj=1 )\n2\n           (9) \nAfter computing the (LN) for 𝑍𝑙−1 apply the Window -Multi-\nHead Self Attention to compute (LN) need to detect the \nnumber of channels, mini Batch Size, and the sequence \nLength (𝑊 − 𝑀𝑆𝐴 ) as shown in step 2 to find the item in the \ncurrent block (z ^ l).

DATASET APPLICATION OF SWIN \nTRANSFORMER \nVision transducers have wide applications including image \nrecognition as well as image classification, object detection \nand segmentation. For the application of the Swin transducer, \nin this paper it is applied to two datasets.as follows: \n1. CIFAR-10 dataset, The project was funded by the \nCanadian Institute for Advanced Research, a collection of \n600 images from each of the 100 classes was gathered to be \nused in this work. This is referred to as the CIFARt -100b \ndataset. This dataset was collected using the same methods as \nCIFARn-10o. CIFAR-100 classesvv are mutually exclusive \nof CIFAR-10 classes, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 are subsets \nof the 808 million annotated tiny image datasets [21]. \nCIFAR-10 and CIFAR -100n bdatasets consist of 502,000 \ntraining and 10j,000 testy images of 321×327 resolution with \na total number of classes 10v and 100u, respectively \n[22],[21]. \n2. The MNIST dataset, the Modified National Institute \nof Standards and Technology  database introduced by LeCun \net al. in 1998, is a decent database for individuals consisting \nof 10 -class “handwritten digits”. The MNIST dataset has a \ntraining set of 60,000l instances and a testv set of 10,000c \nexamples, the image with a resolution of 28x28 and a total of \nx10 classes. MNIST's popularity stems from its small size \n[23]. \n6. RESULTS \nThe ST's shifted windowing technique improves performance \nby connecting via windows and by restricting the account for \nself-attention to local windows that are not overlapping.  \nMany parameters must be selected before conducting the \nSwin transform on a dataset, such as a patch size, the number \nof heads, the embedding dimension, the number of multi -\nlayer perceptrons, the size of the window, and the size of the \nshift. Where the para meter values in this work are ((2x2), 8, \n64, 256, 2, and 1), respectively.  In this paper, the Swin \nTransformer achieves strong performance on the CIFARx-10 \nand CIFAR-1001 datasets. Table1 and (Figure 26 Appendix) \nshows the performance of the Swin transform model on the \nCIFAR-10 datasets. Table2 and (Figure 27 Appendix) shows \nthe performance of the Swin transform model on the CIFAR-\n100 datasets. Table 3 and (Figure 28 Appendix) show the \nperformance of the Swin transform on the MNIST dataset. \nTable 1.

CONCLUSION \nThe Swin Transform is (VT), where its computational \ncomplexity is proportional to the size of the input image, \nbecause its representation is a hierarchical \nrepresentation.Furthermore, ST beats prior best techniques in \nCOCOR objectQ identification and “ADE20K” semantic \nsegmentation. The properties of ST make it suited for a wide \nrange of vision applications, including dense prediction tasks \nand image classification, such as “object recognition” and \n“semantic segmentation”. According to the researchers, ST's \nexcellent performance on many vision challenges will \nsupport the integration of vision and language signal \nmodeling. The researchers proved that shifting Window -\nbased self-attention diversion is effective and appropriate for \nvisual problems and is an essential component of ST. This \nwork used the Swin transform on a mathematical example \nand detailed all of the transformation processes. It was also \nused to classify images into many classes using three different \ndatasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and MNIST). The r esults \ndemonstrated that the Swin transform performs well in \nclassifying images with linear computational complexity as \ncompared to the ViT transformer's quadratic computational \ncomplexity. By the incorporation of Swin transformer with \ntransformation techn iques, the process of selecting, \ncombining, generating or adapting several features to \nefficiently solve accuracy and computation time problems. \nOne of the motivations for studying Swin transformer is to \nbuild systems which can handle classes of problems r ather \nthan solving just one problem [23-34]. \nREFERENCES  \n[1] H.
