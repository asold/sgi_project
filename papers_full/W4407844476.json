  "abstract": "This review paper examines how Generative AI (GAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) can transform smart cities in the Industry 5.0 era. Through selected case studies and portions of the literature, we analyze these technologies’ impact on industrial processes and urban management. The paper targets GAI as an enabler for industrial optimization and predictive maintenance, underlining how domain experts can work with LLMs to improve municipal services and citizen communication, while addressing the practical and ethical challenges in deploying these technologies. We also highlight promising trends, as reflected in real-world case studies ranging from factories to city-wide test-beds and identify pitfalls to avoid. Widespread adoption of GAI still faces challenges that include infrastructure and lack of specialized knowledge as a limitation of proper implementation. While LLMs enable new services for citizens in smart cities, they also expose certain privacy issues, which we aim to investigate in this study. Finally, as a way forward, the paper suggests future research directions covering new ethical AI frameworks and long-term studies on societal impacts. Our paper is a starting point for industrial pioneers and urban developers to navigate the complexity of GAI and LLM integration, balancing the demands of technological innovation on one hand and ethical responsibility on the other.",
