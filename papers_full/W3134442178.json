Participatory experience in technical activities\nand activity with artefacts provide the basis for learning traditional technical skills. Some populations of\nnon-human animals use tools. The ways in which artefacts influence the development of a traditional skill\nin non-human species can provide insight into essential supports for technical traditions in humans and\nshared learning processes across species. In wild bearded capuchins, nut cracking leaves edible pieces of\nnuts, nut shells and stones used as hammers at anvil sites. We addressed how mastery of cracking nuts by\nyoung monkeys is associated with interactions with these objects. We studied monkeys’ reuse of nuts,\nhammers and anvils and the outcome of attempts to crack nuts, and from these data derived their behav-\nioural variability and proficiency in nut cracking. Behavioural variability was the most robust predictor of\nwhether a monkey collects pieces of nuts cracked by others or reuses stones and nuts, and was a stronger\npredictor of proficiency than age. Young monkeys were increasingly likely to reuse the stone used by\nanother after the other monkey had left the anvil as they increasingly focused their behaviour on actions\nrelevant to cracking nuts.\nKeywords: animal traditions; practice; development; tool; artefact\nSocial media summary:The more focused on nutcracking activities wild capuchins are, the more they\nreuse their social mates’tools.\nIntroduction\nCulture allows humans to adapt to an extreme diversity of habitats and contexts. It involves the hori-\nzontal and vertical social transmission of technological improvements, facilitating the development of\nsophisticated tools (Legare,2017). Learning technical skills is an essential outcome of human culture.\nChildren grow up in environments modified by human activity, with objects that make up local tradi-\ntions. Furniture, shelters, cutlery, clothes and tools of various types are ubiquitous. Children partici-\npate while adults use tools, eventually learning to use them on their own.\nArtefacts and traditions\nIn many cultures, parents actively organise space to guide children’s learning to use objects in cultur-\nally appropriate ways, providing them with the opportunity to learn how to use objects even in the\nabsence of a demonstration (Flynn et al.,2013). Even when adults do not actively organise space\n© The Author(s), 2021. Published by Cambridge University Press on behalf of Evolutionary Human Sciences.

For example, using\neye tracker and goal-directed gaze, Green et al. (2016) compared the skills of Swedish and Chinese\ninfants in predicting how adults manipulate spoons and chopsticks. Chinese infants moved their\ngaze to the adult’s mouth when chopsticks were used, but not spoons, while Swedish infants did\nthe same when a spoon was used, but not chopsticks. Thus, infants’gaze was affected by their experi-\nence with adults using these objects according to their own tradition even before they began to handle\nthem themselves: the cultural context provided children with different artefacts and ways to deal with\nthem.\nThis report concerns the relations among the actions of young bearded capuchin monkeys (Sapajus\nlibidinosus) with objects associated with nut cracking across the several years that they are developing\nthis skill. Nut cracking is a technical tradition, and as in many human technical traditions, it results in\nenduring artefacts– the stones and anvils used as hammers (i.e. the tools). According to Borgo et al.\n(2013), tools are‘physical artefacts whose attributed capacity is related to the purpose of physically\nacting on some other entity’. We use the term ‘artefact’ sensu Borgo et al. (2013) for the stones\nand anvils used in nut cracking. Nut cracking by capuchins, platyrrhine monkeys distantly related\nto apes and humans, offers a comparative reference point for consideration of the role of artefacts\nand partners in learning a technical skill.\nUnderstanding how non-human animals acquire technical traditions may provide insights into the\nevolution of human cultural learning (Musgrave et al.,2020a). Fragaszy et al. (2013), using niche con-\nstruction theory (Fragaszy,2011; Odling-Smee et al.,2003), proposed that enduring artefacts support\nnon-human primates’learning technical skills. In such cases, there is an important temporal dimen-\nsion in learning, because the durability of the artefact allows the learner to use the object used previ-\nously as a tool by another. For example, infant chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) reuse folded leaf that\nothers have used to collect water (Sousa et al.,2009), reuse plant probes used by others to collect ter-\nmites (Musgrave et al.,2020b) and reuse stones as hammers for cracking nuts (Estienne et al.,2019).\nThus, skilled adults affect infant chimpanzees’learning of how objects can be used as tools by attract-\ning attention to these objects and by providing access to them for individual activity, as described for\nhuman infants (Rakoczy et al.,2005). Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) learning to handle stones\n(Leca et al.,2010) provide another example. Some groups of these monkeys have traditions of handling\nstones in particular ways (Huffman & Hirata,2003). Young monkeys are attracted to accumulations of\nstones at specific locations that remain from adults’handling sessions. The presence of durable arte-\nfacts at specific locations supports the reuse of stones over time and the maintenance of the stone-\nhandling tradition in groups of Japanese macaques.\nAccording to Ingold (2001), skills are achieved through a process of enskilment. Ingold states that\nskills do not simply appear. Rather, capacities and forms of organisms emerge from developmental\nprocesses, from the sensorial engagement of the organism in a highly structured environment.\nSkills are continually generated and regenerated in the developmental contexts of each organism:\nneuromuscular systems and motor habits are formed while the competencies are established through\nthe organisms’actions in their environment. In this view, development is the result of active engage-\nment in dynamic activities (Thelen et al.,1991). The activities and practices of one generation shape\nthe environment for the next, giving the next generation an education of attention (Ingold,2001). Each\ngeneration builds environmental contexts through their embodied activities, where the next generation\nwill develop its own embodied skills. This conception of development applies to humans and non-\nhuman animals alike. Technical traditions in non-human animals, such as capuchins cracking nuts\nwith stone tools, are examples of this process.\nNut cracking in capuchin monkeys\nSeveral wild populations of robust capuchin monkeys (genus Sapajus) crack open nuts or other\nencased food using hard objects, such as stones or wood, as hammers and anvils (review in Izar\net al., 2018). Young monkeys engage in actions with nuts, anvils and hammers over several years\n2 Briseida Resende et al.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/ehs.2021.16 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nbefore they can open nuts (Eshchar et al.,2016; Resende et al.,2008). Monkeys must follow a specific\naction sequence to crack a nut (take the nut, place it on the anvil, take the hammer and hit it on the nut).\nIn Resende et al.’s (2014) study of a free-ranging group of capuchin monkeys, young monkeys initially\nperformed these actions in variable order and also performed other, unrelated actions such as rolling\na nut (Resende et al.,2014). As they became more skilled at cracking nuts, the monkeys performed\nthe relevant actions in a consistent and effective order (place the nut on a hard surface, pick up a\nstone, strike the nut with the stone) and performed irrelevant actions less often (i.e. behavioural variability\ndeclined). Behavioural variability was a key predictor of the monkeys’proficiency at cracking nuts.\nBeyond adopting a consistent sequence of actions with nuts and stones, to crack a nut, capuchins\nmust control the movement of their body and of the hammer (as one system) so as to produce strikes\nwith sufficient kinetic energy at impact to break the shell. This aspect of nut cracking requires both\nstrength and skill (Mangalam et al.,2016, 2018, 2020). Skill at cracking nuts is not in the monkeys’\nnervous system, nor in the environment, but in their integration. As monkeys act with nuts and stones,\nthey produce different types of space and force relations among stones, nuts, surfaces and their bodies.\nThrough cycles of perception and action, they learn these relations’affordances, and how to coordinate\nthem, as humans do (Thelen et al.,1991; Ulrich and Wolff, 1991; Lockman,2000).\nNut cracking, like all foraging activities in capuchin monkeys, takes place in a social setting. Ottoni\net al. (2005) reported that, during cracking bouts, young monkeys preferentially watched skillful con-\nspecifics cracking and profited from scrounging the remains of nuts at the anvil site. Coelho et al.\n(2015) confirmed that young monkeys chose which monkeys to observe, and found that young mon-\nkeys more frequently observed more productive crackers that also tolerated the young monkeys scroun-\nging. This suggests that eating pieces of cracked nuts attracts young monkeys to particular crackers\nwhile they are cracking.\nAt a longer time scale, Eshchar et al. (2016) showed that at one site, Fazenda Boa Vista, enduring\nartefacts (hammer and anvil stones) at the nut-cracking sites, as well as enduring cracked shells,\nallowed unskilled group members to act with these objects in the absence of an individual cracking\nnuts. The environment formed by the activity of skilled group members biases the attention of\nunskilled members and directs their manipulative activities towards the elements linked to cracking\nnuts. As stones suitable for cracking the resistant palm nuts are rare in the landscape at Fazenda\nBoa Vista (Visalberghi et al.,2009), and they are too heavy for young monkeys to transport them,\nthe presence of stones at anvil sites constitutes an important modification of the environment aiding\nyoung monkeys’handling them together with nuts. Eshchar et al. (2016; see also Fragaszy et al.,2017)\ndemonstrated that young capuchin monkeys were attracted to the cracking artefacts and manipulated\nnuts and hammer stones at above-baseline rates when others were cracking nuts. After others ceased\ncracking, young capuchins continued these actions at rates higher than during baseline for periods\nranging from 30 seconds to several minutes, depending on the action, suggesting that others’actions\nfacilitated their actions. They also increased actions with nuts when at or within arm’s reach of anvil\nsites, suggesting that the artefacts alone stimulate activities related to cracking. All of these studies have\naddressed the role of group members’actions and their artefacts on attracting the attention and action\nof non-skilled immatures. However, developmental changes related to the reuse of artefacts and to the\nconsumption of leftovers have not been reported.\nThe study reported here extends Resende et al.’s (2014) study relating behavioural variability and\nthe emergence of skilled use of a tool in a wild population of bearded capuchin monkeys (S. libidino-\nsus), and addresses hypotheses relating to reuse of nuts and stones by monkeys learning to crack nuts.\nSpecifically, we carried out a longitudinal study examining the relative proportion of all visits to anvil\nsites in which young monkeys scrounged (finding edible pieces of nut kernels; hereafter, leftovers) and\nreused artefacts. We registered if the reuse was immediate, while the previous cracker was still at the\nsite, or within 30 seconds after that monkey left the site. We also registered if monkeys collected pieces\nof cracked nuts immediately after the nut was cracked and whether this occurred in the presence of the\ncracker (immediate scrounging) or after the other monkey had left (delayed scrounging). We use\nthe term ‘scrounge’without implying generosity from the individual that cracked the nut, nor that\nEvolutionary Human Sciences 3\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/ehs.2021.16 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nthe action occurred at the expense of that individual. We interpreted activities towards nuts and\nscrounging as revealing perception of food, and activities towards anvils and hammers as revealing\nperception of tools. We included individuals’ age (in months), which is a correlate of body size\n(Fragaszy et al., 2016), variability of behaviours in nut cracking, and proficiency at cracking as inde-\npendent variables in our analyses.\nConsidering the previously reported inverse relation between proficiency in nut cracking and variability\nof actions related to nut cracking (Resende et al.,2014), we predicted that: (a) proportions of visits to anvil\nsites where the young monkey displayed scrounging and reuse of nuts (abandoned or partially cracked by\nthe previous monkey) are positively correlated with behavioural variability during cracking activity and\nnegatively correlated with age and proficiency; (b) proportions of visits to anvil sites where the young\nmonkey displayed immediate reuse of hammer and anvil are positively associated with behavioural vari-\nability and negatively associated with age and proficiency; and (c) proportions of visits to anvil sites where\nthe young monkey displayed delayed reuse of hammer and anvil show the opposite pattern– negative\nassociation with behavioural variability and positive association with age and proficiency.\nMethods\nStudy site\nThis study was conducted at Fazenda Boa Vista (hereafter, FBV; 9°39′ S, 45°25′ W), in the state of\nPiauí, Brazil. FBV is a flat open woodland (altitude 420 m a.s.l.). Rainfall is concentrated mainly\nbetween October and April (for further information see Eshchar et al., 2016; Visalberghi et al.,\n2008). Palm trees are abundant in FBV, and in this study monkeys cracked piassava nuts (Orbygnia\nsp.; average length 61.3 mm, 50.6 g; the shell is 6 mm thick with a peak-force-at-failure of 11.5 kN;\nVisalberghi et al.,2008).\nThe hammer stones used as tools to crack nuts weigh on average around 1 kg, although they range\nfrom 250 g to 2.5 kg. They are quartzites, siltstones or hard sandstones. Anvils are flat, or nearly flat,\nhorizontal or have slightly sloping surfaces– a boulder, an exposed stone or a horizontal log (for\ndetails, see Visalberghi et al.,2007).\nThe study took place in the field laboratory, an open area about 12 m in diameter that capuchin\nmonkeys regularly and freely visited (more details in Fragaszy et al.,2013). The field laboratory con-\ntained 12 cracking sites (four wooden and eight stone anvils) with stones nearby that were commonly\nused by proficient individuals for cracking nuts (Visalberghi & Fragaszy,2013) and nut shells all over\nthe area (Figure 1).\nSubjects and data collection\nThe 33 subjects providing data in this study ranged in age from 3 months to more than 10 years (for\nthose adult monkeys for which we did not know the exact age, we assigned an age of 120 months for\ndata analysis). Seven monkeys were born and three left the group during the study (see Supplementary\nMaterial).\nData were collected in four discrete field seasons (dry season– season 1, June–July 2016 and season\n3, August–September 2017; rainy season– season 2, February–March 2017 and season 4, April–May\n2018), each lasting 34, 33, 31 and 20 days respectively. In season 1, there were 23 monkeys (seven adult\nfemales, five adult males, three immature males and eight immature females); in season 2 there were 23\nmonkeys (seven adult females, four adult males, four immature males and eight immature females); in\nseason 3, there were 28 monkeys (seven adult females, four adult males, eight immature males and\nnine immature females) and in season 4 there were 30 monkeys (seven adult females, four adult\nmales, nine immature males and 10 immature females). Because the participation of the monkeys\nwas opportunistic, the number of sessions and minutes of engagement in cracking activity varied\nacross seasons (season 1, 12 sessions and 592 min; season 2, 11 sessions and 420 min; season 3, five\nsessions and 219 min; season 4, 12 sessions and 614 min).\n4 Briseida Resende et al.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/ehs.2021.16 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nWe used 12 cracking sites (four wooden and eight stone anvils;Figure 1). Each anvil was identified\nand subdivided into small areas with black ink marks to facilitate recording of reuse (Figure 2): we\nregistered as anvil reuse when the focal animal used the same subarea as the previous monkey. We\nmarked stones used as hammers. We ran one or two experimental sessions per day, depending on\nthe monkeys’attendance at the field site. Prior to each experimental session, we put a hammer kit\nwith four stones differing in size and material at each cracking site (Figure 2). Three researchers turned\nthe cameras on and set the experimental setting. Before starting each new session, the researchers set\nout the hammer kit and 30 nuts on the field laboratory area. We used seven cameras strategically posi-\ntioned to capture all of the cracking activity going on at the field laboratory (Figure 1). The session\nstarted when the monkeys approached the area. While recording, the researchers spoke the names\nof the monkeys that arrived at the field laboratory and the anvils they used, for later reference during\nvideo transcription. Filming ended when all of the nuts had been cracked and/or when all of the mon-\nkeys left the field laboratory, whichever came first. At the completion of the study, all marks were\nremoved from the anvils and hammer stones.\nThe protocol was reviewed and approved by the CEUA IPUSP (Ethical Committee for Use of\nAnimals from Instituto de Psicologia da USP, CEUA 6870180216). This research was conducted\nunder ICMBio permit no. 28689-5. The study adheres to the code of best practices for studies of non-\nhuman primates set by the International Primatological Society.\nData transcription and variables\nDetails about the subjects’ participation are provided in Supplementary Material. The videos were\ntranscribed using BORIS software, a free and open-source software available for GNU/Linux,\nWindows and Mac OS (http://www.boris.unito.it/). For each monkey who appeared in the video,\nwe registered if it was following a group member and if it manipulated hammers, anvils and nuts.\nIf so, we registered how they manipulated nuts, anvils and hammers, according to the following cat-\negories: take, tap, rub, bite, lick, sniff, rotate, hit (using the hands, the nut or the hammer), place nut\non the anvil. We registered if each nut was cracked open, and if the manipulated item was the same as\nthe one used by the immediately previous cracker who used the site in that session. We registered the\nreuse of nuts when the focal monkeys acted on nuts that were abandoned intact or partially cracked by\nthe cracker. We registered the cracker’s identity, and if the reuse was immediate (while the cracker was\nFigure 1.

We also registered if\nthe monkey scrounged (i.e. ingested nut leftovers) while the monkey that had just cracked a nut was\nstill at the site (immediate scrounging), or up to 30 seconds after it had left (delayed scrounging), if the\nyoung monkey had observed the cracker at close range (positioning the body facing the cracker, gazing\nat its action), and if there were agonistic interactions. Since there were few agonistic events, they were\nnot included in further analysis.\nWe defined the reuse index (RI) and the scrounging index (SI) as: RI = frequency of visits with\nreuse/frequency of visits and SI = frequency of visits with scrounging/frequency of visits. These indexes\nwere calculated for each monkey, in each season. The closer to 1 they were, the more the monkey\nreused/scrounged in every visit to the sites. We calculated indexes for‘immediate reuse’, when the\ncracker was present, and‘delayed reuse’, up to 30 seconds after the cracker had left the cracking site.\nWe calculated, for each monkey, in each season in which it appeared during data collection, the RI\nvalues for immediate and delayed hammer reuse, immediate and delayed anvil reuse and immediate\nand delayed nut reuse (abandoned intact or partially cracked), as well as the total RI (hammer and\nanvil reuse). Also, we calculated, for each monkey, in each season in which it appeared during data\ncollection, the SI for: immediate and delayed scrounging and the total SI. Thus we had eight values\nfor SI (4 seasons × 2 types of scrounging– immediate and delayed) for each animal that appeared\nat an anvil in all four seasons.\nFor testing behavioural variability considering actions filmed at the cracking sites, we calculated the\nbehavioural variability index (BVI) for each monkey in each season (Resende et al.,2014), as:\nBVI = (F\ntot –Fc)/Ftot\nwhere Fc is the frequency of nut-cracking behaviour and Ftot is the frequency of manipulative\nbehaviour.\nA BVI near 1 means a higher proportion of different categories of behaviour performed at the sites,\nindicating that the monkeys’actions were not restricted to cracking activity; a BVI near 0 means that\nthe animal restricted its actions to the sequence used for cracking.\nFor testing proficiency, we calculated, for each monkey in each season, a proficiency index (PI)\n(Fragaszy et al.,2010):\nPI = (n nuts cracked/n nuts hit)× 100\nIn order to distinguish individuals that never struck a nut with a stone from those that struck a nut\nwith a stone but did not crack it, we added the constant 0.0001 to the number of cracked nuts of those\nthat struck but never cracked. Thus, 0 means that the monkey never struck a nut with a stone.\nFigure 2.

The black marks on anvils delimit the subareas. The blue marks on the anvils show the\npits left by repeated cracking on the same spot. Similar pits are evident on the surface of the stone anvil.\n6 Briseida Resende et al.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/ehs.2021.16 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nAnalyses\nThe data comprised 59 seasonal samples for immatures (3–72 months) and 39 seasonal samples for\nadults (73 months and older). We analysed the proportion of monkeys’visits to cracking sites per sea-\nson in which they scrounged edible leftovers or reused artefacts of conspecifics’ cracking activities.\nIndependent variables were level of cracking skills, age, behavioural variability and the presence of\nthe previous cracker (present during immediate reuse; absent during delayed reuse). We tested\nthree predictions: (a) the proportion of visits to anvil sites in which the monkeys displayed scrounging\nand reuse of nuts are positively correlated with behavioural variability during cracking activity and\nnegatively correlated with age and proficiency; (b) the proportion of visits to anvil sites in which\nthe monkeys displayed immediate reuse of hammer and anvil are positively associated with behav-\nioural variability and negatively associated with age and proficiency; and (c) the proportion of visits\nto anvil sites in which the monkeys displayed delayed reuse of hammer and anvil show the opposite\npattern – negative association with behavioural variability and positive association with age and\nproficiency.\nOur analyses used the monkeys’ages (in months), BVI and PI as developmental categories indicat-\ning cracking skills (regressors) in generalised linear mixed models, an extension of generalised linear\nmodels. We assumed a normal distribution with a log link to regress the independent variables age,\nBVI and PI on the dependent variables: immediate reuse of hammer stones, immediate reuse of\nanvil stones, immediate reuse of nuts and immediate scrounging, and delayed reuse of hammer stones,\ndelayed reuse of anvil stones, delayed reuse of nuts and delayed scrounging. Because the individuals in\nour sample were unevenly sampled across the four field seasons (some disappeared from the study\ngroup and others were born during the study), we controlled for individual identity and field season.\nWe tested each independent variable alone and in combination and we chose the best models based on\nAkaike information criterion values. Statistical tests were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics for\nWindows, version 21.0.\nResults\nThe distributions of PI and BVI as a function of age are shown inFigures 3and 4. Adult monkeys had\na PI greater than 0 in 85% of samples (average PI = 7.7); average BVI was 0.15. Immatures had PI\ngreater than 0 in just 20% of samples and average BVI was 0.73. Age predicted PI (F = 114.74, d.f.\n1\n= 1, d.f.2 = 98, p < 0.001), although it was only slightly positively related (coefficient = 0.082; SD =\n0.008, t = 10.71, p < 0.001). Similarly, age was a significant predictor of BVI (F = 99.89, d.f.1 =1 ,\nd.f.2 = 98,p < 0.001), but it was only slightly negatively related (coefficient =−0.015; SD = 0.002,t =\n−9.99, p < 0.001). The BVI, on the other hand, was a significant predictor of PI (F = 27.86, d.f.1 =1 ,\nd.f.2 = 98, p < 0.001) and was strongly negatively related to PI (coefficient =−3.30, SD = 0.63,t =\n−5.28, p < 0.001). Thus, BVI was a better predictor of proficiency than age.\nScrounging and reuse of nuts\nAdults were observed engaging in immediate scrounging at least once in three samples (7%), and in\ndelayed scrounging in 17 samples (41%). Immatures engaged in immediate scrounging in 78% of sam-\nples, and delayed scrounging in 86% of samples. The age of individuals and their BVI were significant\nregressors of immediate scrounging (F = 14.27; d.f.\n1 = 2; d.f.2 = 97,p < 0.001). The BVI contributed\nmost to the regression and was positively related (coefficient = 2.91, SD = 0.82,t = 3.56, p = 0.001,\n95% CI = 1.287–4.537; seeFigure 5), while age was slightly negatively related to immediate scrounging\n(coefficient =−0.015, SD = 0.005,t = −2.84, p = 0.006, 95% CI =−0.028 to −0.004). The BVI was the\nbest regressor of delayed scrounging (F = 25.27, d.f.1 = 1, d.f.2 = 98,p < 0.001) and was positively related\nto this variable (coefficient = 2.03, SD = 0.40,t = 5.03,p < 0.001, 95% CI = 1.229–2.832).\nEvolutionary Human Sciences 7\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/ehs.2021.16 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nAdults were observed at least once reusing nuts immediately in two samples (5%) and immatures in\n61% of samples. The ages of individuals and their BVIs were significant regressors of immediate reuse\nof nuts (F = 12.69; d.f.\n1 = 2; d.f.2 = 97,p < 0.001). The BVI contributed most to the regression and was\npositively related (coefficient = 2.53, SD = 0.81,t = 3.13,p = 0.002, 95% CI = 0.928–4.138), while age\nwas slightly negatively related to immediate reuse of nuts (coefficient =−0.016, SD = 0.006,t =\n−2.76, p = 0.007, 95% CI =−0.028 to −0.004). Adults were observed at least once reusing nuts after\na delay in 64% of samples and immatures, in 97% of samples. For the delayed reuse of nuts, the\nbest model included the variables BVI and PI as regressors ( F = 13.24, d.f.\n1 = 2, d.f.2 = 97; p <\n0.001). The BVI contributed most to the regression and was positively related to the reuse of nuts\n(coefficient = 0.82, SD = 0.23,t = 3.53, p = 0.001, 95% CI = 0.357–1.278), while the PI was slightly\nFigure 3.

In sum, BVI was the strongest predictor of scrounging and of the reuse of nuts\n(Figure 6).\nImmediate reuse of hammer and anvil\nAdults reused hammer stones immediately at least once per season in a total of seven samples (17%);\nimmatures did so in 22 samples (37%). The best model for immediate reuse of hammer stones\nincluded only the regressor age of the individuals (F = 5.495; d.f.\n1 = 1; d.f.2 = 98,p = 0.021). As indivi-\nduals grew older, they decreased the immediate reuse of hammer stones (coefficient = 0.032, SD =\n0.014; t = −2.344, p = 0.021, 95% CI =−0.059 to −0.005; see Figure 7). Variation in immediate\nreuse of anvils was not related to any of the regressors tested.\nDelayed reuse of hammers and anvils\nAdults reused a stone after a delay at least once per season in 95% of samples; immatures did so in 61%\nof samples (Figure 7). Adults reused a stone after delay in 26% of visits to an anvil; immatures did so in\n9% of visits. All variables were significantly related to the delayed reuse of hammer stone, but when\nregressed in a single model (F = 10.87, d.f.\n1 = 3; d.f.2 = 96,p < 0.001), the BVI was the only significant\nregressor and its coefficient was negative (coefficient =−2.83, SD = 0.65,t = −4.68, p < 0.001, 95% CI =\n−0.345 to−0.130). The best model for delayed reuse of anvils included BVI and PI as regressors (F =\n15.38, d.f.1 = 2, d.f.2 = 96;p < 0.001), but only the BVI contributed significantly to the regression and\nwas negatively related to the reuse of an anvil (coefficient =−1.57, SD = 0.36,t = −4.37, p < 0.001, 95%\nCI =−2.278 to −0.854). In sum, monkeys with high behavioural variability (younger, less proficient\nmonkeys) were unlikely to reuse a stone or an anvil used by another monkey within the previous\n30 seconds.\nDiscussion\nOur study addressed how young capuchin monkeys’interactions with objects that are associated with\nthe consumption of nuts change over time, as they begin to crack nuts on their own using stone ham-\nmers and anvils. We predicted that (a) the proportions of visits to anvil sites in which the young\nFigure 5. Distribution of proportion of visits with immediate and delayed scrounging in relation to the BVI. Each point represents\none monkey during one season (98 samples in total).\nEvolutionary Human Sciences 9\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/ehs.2021.16 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nmonkey displayed scrounging and reuse of nuts would be positively associated with behavioural vari-\nability during cracking activity and negatively associated with age and proficiency, (b) the proportions\nof visits to anvil sites where the young monkey displayed immediate reuse of hammer and of anvil\nwould be positively associated with behavioural variability and negatively associated with age and pro-\nficiency and (c) the proportions of visits to anvil sites where the young monkey displayed delayed reuse\nof hammer and of anvil would be negatively associated with behavioural variability and positively asso-\nciated with age and proficiency.\nWe confirmed the first prediction, and only partially confirmed the second and third. As the mon-\nkeys grew older, becoming proficient at cracking nuts and, especially, as they behaved more consist-\nently with stones and nuts, they scrounged nuts less often. Age was the only predictor of\nimmediate reuse of hammer stones– younger monkeys were more likely to do this than older monkeys\n– but the effect of age was modest. Delayed reuse of hammer stones was predicted only by behavioural\nFigure 6. Distribution of proportion of visits with immediate and delayed reuse of nuts in relation to the BVI.

Distribution of proportion of visits with immediate and delayed reuse of hammer stones in relation to age (in months).\nEach point represents one monkey during one season (98 samples in total). Adults were assigned age = 120 months.\n10 Briseida Resende et al.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/ehs.2021.16 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nvariability. The less variable their behaviour towards nuts and stones was, the more likely monkeys\nwere to reuse hammers and anvils after the previous cracker had left the anvil. Neither age nor pro-\nficiency predicted delayed reuse of hammer stones.\nOverall, young unskilled monkeys show consistent scrounging and reuse of nuts, both immediate\nand delayed, but re-using stones is not as prominent an activity as looking for nut debris to eat. This\nfinding was expected because very young monkeys are too small to lift most of the hammer stones\nused by adults. However, as monkeys developed cracking skills (and grew larger), they shifted to\nthe adult pattern of bringing nuts to the anvil and re-using a stone after the previous cracker had\nleft the anvil. Adults reused stones within 30 seconds of a previous cracker leaving the anvil site on\nabout a quarter of their trips to an anvil. Immatures approached this proportion around four years\nof age. We suggest that monkeys began to value stones as potential tools when they could use them\nto crack nuts, and in that same time frame, nuts left by others became less valued than nuts that\nthey brought to the anvil themselves.\nPerhaps the most robust finding in this study is the predictive relation in young monkeys between\ndecreasing variability in behaviour and developing skill at cracking nuts. The pattern we observed in\ncapuchin monkeys of decreasing behavioural variation with skill development is seen in humans mas-\ntering motor tasks, such as Indian craftsmen who use hammering movements for knapping stones\n(Biryukova & Bril, 2008) or children who show more adaptive movements through practice\n(Adolph & Berger, 2011), as well as captive adult capuchins learning to crack nuts with tools\n(Visalberghi, 1987). Tool use emerges from previous existing manual behaviours in humans, as\nKahrs et al. (2013) have shown, for example, for the emergence of hammering from banging move-\nments in 6- to 15-month-old infants. According to Lockman and Kahrs (2017, p. 330), ‘there is a\ndevelopmental synergy between affordance detection and motor learning: as immatures continually\nexplore affordances entailed by object-surface combinations in real time, they tune the actions that\nwill be incorporated into tool use over developmental time.… Collectively, the new research suggests\nthat basic types of tool use in young humans and animals are rooted not in higher order cognitive\nabilities but shared principles of sensorimotor learning’. The present study contributes to the under-\nstanding of the sensorimotor foundations of tooling. Gradual changes in the organisation of actions,\naccompanied by gradual changes in motor capabilities associated with physical growth, underlie\nimproving skills in young monkeys learning to crack nuts with stone hammers. As adults, these move-\nments reflect motor synergies involving the whole body, and fine control of bipedal balance during\nvigorous dynamic movements with proportionally heavy stones (Mangalam et al.,2016, 2018, 2020).\nReturning to the notion of artefacts, identifying how non-human primates develop relations to arte-\nfacts may help to illuminate the social learning processes implicated in traditions and culture.\nChimpanzees and capuchin monkeys offer slightly different alternatives. Young chimpanzees are\nattracted by others using tools and, when they can, they eat pieces of foods remaining at anvil sites\nwhen adults, usually their mothers, crack nuts (Inoue-Nakamura and Matsuzawa, 1997). When\nthey are very young, they play with objects that adults used as tools, and preferentially reuse adults’\ntools (e.g. stone hammers; Estienne et al.,2019; Carvalho et al.,2009; plant probes; Musgrave et al.,\n2020b) when they are first learning to use tools. Eventually, however, their reliance on others’tools\ndiminishes. Before they master cracking nuts, immature capuchin monkeys at FBV display the\nsame general pattern as chimpanzees: attraction to others that are cracking nuts, interest in nut debris\nand active manipulation of the objects associated with cracking nuts. A major difference, however, is\nthat young capuchin monkeys from FBV cannot at first lift the stones used by adults because they are\ntoo heavy. They increasingly reuse stones left at anvils as they grow large enough to do so. Adults of\nboth species also reuse stones used by others, in part because hammer stones are rare away from anvils\nand because they are costly to transport. A second major difference is that, in chimpanzees, immatures\nrely on their mothers’nut cracking for access to relevant objects and pieces of food, whereas immature\ncapuchins rely on other adult individuals, in addition to their mother (Estienne et al.,2019; Fragaszy\net al., unpublished data). The facilitative roles of social partners for chimpanzees and for capuchins\nlearning to crack nuts include providing appropriate artefacts in one place coupled with attraction\nEvolutionary Human Sciences 11\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/ehs.2021.16 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nto that place in the form of food (pieces of nuts), and promoting repetition of relevant actions that\nincorporate artefacts (striking nuts with a stone). These are relatively simple aids for both species,\nbut collectively, they are powerful supports for the the development of this technical tradition, because\nthey bias the learner’s attention and activities (Fragaszy et al.,2013, 2017).\nSupplementary material.
