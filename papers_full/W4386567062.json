Only 20% of patients with \nHCC are candidates for resection [2]. Over the past two dec-\nades, image-guided minimally invasive techniques have been \nwidely used to treat hepatocellular carcinoma, and promising \nresults have been obtained with one such technique, namely, \nradiofrequency ablation (RFA), with the survival rates com-\nparable to those of hepatectomy [3 ]. Over the past decade, \nthere has been increasing interest in RFA as a useful treat-\nment modality for patients with HCCs that were considered \nunresectable due to poor liver function or complications [4, \n5]. Improvements in surveillance programs have reduced the \nnumber of hepatocellular carcinomas detected in advanced \nstages, with a corresponding increase in the use of RFA [2].\nWhile RFA is recognized as an effective local treat-\nment for hepatocellular carcinoma, HCC was reported \nto be associated with a worse prognosis as tumor size \nincrease, due to the high incidence of recurrence [6 ]. Risk \nstratification of HCC patients undergoing RFA can help \nclinicians identify patients at high risk for cancer recur -\nrence/progression after RFA. These patients may require \nmore aggressive treatments and closer monitoring to detect \nand manage cancer recurrence or progression. In addition, \nthe economic and medical burden of HCC is significant, \nand more effective treatment methods are needed to pro-\nlong the survival and improve the quality of life of HCC \npatients. Therefore, effective tools are needed for prognos-\ntic evaluation of HCC patients undergoing RFA.\nMachine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelli -\ngence (AI) drawing on the principles of computer science \nand mathematics, that is focused on developing and imple-\nmenting computer algorithms through the development of \nprobabilistic or statistical models based on existing data, \nto maximize the predictive accuracy in many fields [7 ]. \nRecently, tremendous success has been achieved in mul-\ntiple fields, from natural language processing to computer \nvision through the use of transformer-based models [8–11]. \nTransformer models show improved performance over exist-\ning deep learning-based models, and are currently accorded \nstate-of-the-art status for natural processing [10] and com-\nputer vision tasks [ 9, 11]. A novel transformer model that \nhas been developed recently for survival analysis [12] has \nbeen demonstrated to show high performance on tabular data \nsets as compared with deep learning-based models, such as \nDeepSurv [13] and DeepHit [14]. Although the transformer \nmodel appears to be a promising technology for accurate \nevaluation of the prognosis in HCC patients treated by RFA, \nthere are no reports yet of prediction of the prognosis using a \ntransformer model in HCC patients undergoing RFA.\nThis study was aimed at developing and validating a \ntransformer model for predicting the overall survival in \npatients with HCC treated by RFA, as compared with the \nperformance of a deep learning-based model. Such a predic-\ntion model is expected to enable prediction of the therapeutic \noutcomes prior to treatment and allow physicians to design \npersonalized therapeutic strategies for individual patients.\nMaterials and methods\nPatients\nBetween February 1999 and December 2019, a total of 1855 \ntreatment-naïve HCC patients underwent RFA as the ini-\ntial treatment at the Department of Gastroenterology, The \nUniversity of Tokyo Hospital. Information on patient age at \nthe start of the initial treatment, sex, serum levels of albu-\nmin, total bilirubin (TB), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), \nalanine aminotransferase (ALT), serum creatinine, alpha-\nfetoprotein (AFP), and Lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive \nfraction of AFP (AFP-L3), platelet count, prothrombin \ntime (PT), and results of serology for hepatitis B surface \n(HBs) antigen and hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody status \nwere available for all the 1855 patients. After excluding 49 \npatients in whom RFA had been performed with non-cura-\ntive intent to reduce the tumor burden and 28 patients for \nwhom information on the serum levels of des-gamma-car -\nboxyprothrombin (DCP) was lacking due to warfarin admin-\nistration, we enrolled 1778 patients in the present study. The \ninclusion criteria for RFA were as follows: platelet count \nnot less than 50 ×  103/mm3, TB < 3 mg/dL, and prothrom-\nbin activity > 50%. Patients with macroscopic vascular inva-\nsion, refractory ascites, and/or extrahepatic metastasis were \nexcluded from this study.\nDiagnosis of HCC\nThe diagnosis of HCC was accomplished through the use \nof dynamic computed tomography (CT) or magnetic reso-\nnance imaging (MRI), with hyper-attenuation during the \narterial phase and washout during the late phase considered \nas conclusive criteria for the diagnosis of HCC [15]. In cases \nwhere the diagnosis of HCC could not be ascertained defini-\ntively by CT, an ultrasound-guided tumor biopsy was per -\nformed, with the pathological diagnosis made on the basis \nof the Edmondson–Steiner criteria [16].\nRFA procedure and follow‑up\nThe RFA technique employed for the patients enrolled in \nthis study is described elsewhere [17]. Briefly, RFA was \ncarried out under real-time ultrasound guidance, using \n133Hepatology International (2024) 18:131–137 \n1 3\na single needle pass (Cool-tip ®, Covidien, Boulder, CO, \nUSA/Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA, or VIVARF, \n STARmed®, Gyeonggi-do, Korea). Following treatment, \npatients were monitored for recurrence of HCC by dynamic \nCT or MRI at 4-month intervals; the serum AFP, DCP, and \nAFP-L3 levels were also recorded. Recurrence of HCC was \ndiagnosed based on the same criteria as those applied for \nthe diagnosis of HCC. Liver biochemistry tests were also \nconducted every 4 months to assess the liver function.\nModel development\nWe applied a transformer model for survival analysis (Sur -\nvTRACE) for predicting the overall survival in patients \nwith HCC treated by RFA [12]. The transformer model \nis a type of machine learning architecture that uses self-\nattention to process input sequences of variable lengths and \ncapture long-term dependencies. It has been accorded state-\nof-the-art status for various applications, including natural \nlanguage processing, precluding the need to rely on tradi-\ntional sequential processing methods [8 –10]. To develop \nthe model, 16 potential predictor variables of the patients \nwere employed: age; sex; daily alcohol consumption; tumor \nnumber; maximum tumor size; serum albumin (Alb), TB, \nAST, ALT, AFP, DCP, and AFP-L3; serology test results \nfor HCV antibody and HBs antigen; platelet count; and \nprothrombin time. We standardized the data to eliminate \nthe influences of dimensional and value range differences \namong the variables. For comparison, we also developed a \ndeep learning-based model using DeepSurv. DeepSurv is \na multi-layer feedforward model that draws on biological \nneural networks for information processing. It estimates the \nimpact of variables on the hazard rate parameterized by the \nnetwork weight, thereby serving as a predictive tool in sur -\nvival analysis [13].\nStatistical analysis\nContinuous variables are presented as the median values with \nthe first and third quartiles, while categorical variables are \npresented as numbers and frequencies (%). To evaluate the \nperformance of the model, the 1778 patients enrolled in the \nstudy were randomly divided into three groups, as follows: \n(i) the training set (80%), which was used to build the model \n(1422 patients), (ii) the development set, which was used to \ndetermine when to stop the training process (178 patients), and \n(iii) the test set, which was used to evaluate the performance of \neach classifier (178 patients). The Harrell's c-index was deter-\nmined to assess the discrimination performance of the models \nin both the training (internal validation) and test sets (external \nvalidation) [18]. All the prediction models were implemented \nand assessed in Python using SurvTRACE [12] and DeepSurv \n0.2.1 [13]. The evaluative performance of each model was \nassessed by Kaplan–Meier curve analyses and log-rank tests \nacross diverse risk groups using R3.6.3 (http:// www.R- proje ct. \norg) [19]. The significance level was set at < 0.05 for all tests.\nResults\nPatient characteristics\nThe study cohort consisted of 1778 treatment-naïve HCC \npatients who had undergone RFA as the primary treatment \nat a single institution. The patient characteristics are shown \nin Table 1; the median age was 70 years and approximately \n60% were male. The median maximum tumor size and tumor \nnumber were 2.2 cm and 1, respectively. The patients with \nChild–Pugh class A accounted for 78.4% of all patients. \nOver a median follow-up of 50.7 months, the 5- and 10-year \nsurvival rates were calculated as 63.7% (95% confidence \ninterval [CI] 61.4–66.1%) and 30.4% (95% CI 28.0–33.1%), \nrespectively (Fig.  1). During the follow-up period, 1108 \npatients (62.3%) had died. The cause of death was HCC in \n549 patients (49.5%), liver failure in 196 (17.7%), gastroin-\ntestinal bleeding in 41 (3.7%), complications related to pro-\ncedure in 4 (0.4%), liver unrelated disease in 226 (20.4%), \nand undetermined in 92 (8.3%). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year local \ntumor recurrence with or without distant recurrence were \n1.7%, 5.3%, and 6.5%, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 1).\nModeling process for developing the transformer \nmodel\nFor developing the transformer model, we applied the fol-\nlowing hyperparameters: an epoch number of at most 100 \nwith early stopping based on the development set perfor -\nmance, a batch size of 64, and a learning rate of 0.0001. \nThe training process finished after 46 epochs, with a final \nvalidation loss of 1.16 (Supplementary Fig. 2).\nPredictive performance of the transformer model \nin comparison with that of the deep learning model\nThe discriminatory performance of the predictive models \nwas assessed by determining the Harrell’s c -index. The \nindex values for the test set (external validation) and training \nset (internal validation) were 0.69 and 0.71, respectively, for \nthe transformer model, and 0.60 and 0.59, respectively, for \nthe deep learning-based DeepSurv model (Table  2).\nPrognostic stratification of the patients using \nthe transformer model\nFigure 2 shows the Kaplan–Meier curves for survival time \nafter the initial RFA categorized into two (Fig.  2a) and \nthree (Fig. 2b) risk groups based on the survival estimation \n134 Hepatology International (2024) 18:131–137\n1 3\nobtained using the transformer model. The transformer \nmodel showed a high discriminatory power for both the two \nand three risk categories (p < 0.001 in both risk categories).\nPersonalized prediction using the transformer \nmodel\nFinally, we applied the transformer model for predicting \nthe overall survival in patients with HCC treated by RFA. \nSupplementary Fig. 2 shows the predicted survival in two \npatients: a case of a 76-year-old female patient who died \nabout 6 years after the initial RFA treatment (Supplementary \nFig. 3a) and a case of a 55-year-old female patient with con-\nfirmed survival of approximately 10 years after the initial \nRFA treatment (Supplementary Fig. 3b). The transformer \nmodel allowed output of individual survival predictions.\nDiscussion\nRFA plays an important role in the curative treatment of \nearly-stage hepatocellular carcinoma because of its low \ninvasiveness and high efficacy. The recent report from Italy \nshowed a progressive patient aging, an incremental use of \nsemi-annual surveillance which allowing for the detection \nof tiny lesions, and an increased use of radiofrequency abla-\ntion to the detriment of percutaneous ethanol injection from \n2004 to 2018. Due to its minimally invasive nature and high \nefficacy in early-stage tumors, RFA plays an important role \nin the management of older patients and small hepatocellular \ncarcinomas and may have influenced the ameliorative effect \non cancer stage migration during this period[20].\nTable 1  Baseline characteristics of the 1778 patients who underwent \nradiofrequency ablation treatment for primary hepatocellular carci-\nnoma\nContinuous variables are represented as the median values with the \nfirst and third quartiles and categorical variables are represented as \nnumbers and frequencies (%)\nVariable Value (n = 1778)\nSex, n (%)\n Female 670 (37.7)\n Male 1108 (62.3)\nAge (years) 70 (64–76)\nBody mass index 23.4 (21.3–36.7)\nViral infection, n (%)\n HBs antigen-positive 200 (11.2)\n HCV antibody-positive 1219 (68.7)\n Both positive 15 (0.8)\n Both negative 344 (19.3)\nAlcohol consumption, n (%)\n < 50 g/day 1346 (75.7)\n 50–80 g/day 171 (9.6)\n > 80 g/day 261 (14.7)\nSerum albumin (g/dl) 3.7 (3.4–4.0)\nSerum creatinine (mg/dl) 0.7 (0.6–0.9)\nSerum total bilirubin (mg/dl) 0.8 (0.6–1.1)\nProthrombin time (%) 86 (74–100)\nPlatelet count (×  103/mm3) 110 (79–150)\nSerum AST (IU/l) 50 (34.25–70.75)\nSerum ALT (IU/l) 42 (27–66)\nTumor size (cm) 2.2 (1.7–2.9)\nTumor number 1 (1–2)\nSerum AFP (ng/dl) 15 (6–56)\nSerum DCP (mAU/ml) 22 (15–49)\nSerum AFP-L3 (%) 0.5 (0.5–6.8)\nAscites, n (%)\n Absent 1563 (87.9)\n Present 215 (12.1)\nEncephalopathy, n (%)\n Absent 1741 (97.9)\n Present 37 (2.1)\nFig. 1  Overall survival in the 1778 primary hepatocellular carcinoma \npatients treated by radiofrequency ablation as the initial treatment\nTable 2  Predictive performance (c-index) of the models\nTraining set (internal \nvalidation)\nTest set \n(external \nvalidation)\nTransformer-based \nmodel\n0.71 0.69\nDeepSurv 0.59 0.60\n135Hepatology International (2024) 18:131–137 \n1 3\nAccurate prediction of the patient prognosis after RFA is \na critical aspect of personalized medicine, as it is crucial for \ndetermining the most appropriate treatment plan for patients \nand improving the overall outcomes. For example, it can be \nhypothesized that patients characterized by the transformer \nmodel as having a negative prognosis are more likely to have \nhighly malignant HCC. Such patients could potentially be \noptimal candidates for adjuvant or more intensive treatment. \nIt may also aid in determining the frequency and intensity \nof follow-up monitoring/imaging. Several factors have been \nidentified as prognostic indicators in HCC patients under -\ngoing RFA, including the age, tumor size, tumor number, \ntumor marker, platelet count, and liver function [3, 21].\nDespite the potential of the transformer model as a prog-\nnosis evaluation tool for HCC patients undergoing RFA, \nthere are currently no reports available on its use as a prog-\nnostic prediction model in HCC patients treated by RFA; \ntherefore, in this study, we developed a transformer-based \nmachine learning model using potential risk factors to pre-\ndict the overall survival in patients with HCC treated by \nRFA. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study \nto report on the utility of a transformer model for predict-\ning survival in patients with HCC. In the current study, we \nobserved that the transformer-based model exhibited bet-\nter predictive performance than DeepSurv, which had been \nidentified previously as a robust model for predicting the \nsurvival or time-to-event [13].\nThe transformer model used in the current study is a neu-\nral network architecture that uses self-attention mechanisms \nand positional encoding to effectively model long-term \ndependencies in sequences of words or other tokens [ 8]. It \nhas been accorded state-of-the-art status for a wide range \nof natural language processing tasks and is highly paral-\nlelizable, making it faster to train and able to handle larger \ndatasets than earlier models [10]. For example, ChatGPT is \na notable example of the advancement of transformer models \nfor natural language processing and machine learning tasks \n[22], affirming the potential of the transformer model in vari-\nous domains. The transformer model has also achieved state-\nof-the art status for multiple computer vision tasks [9 , 11]. \nThe ability of the transformer model to effectively model \ncomplex and long-term dependencies in data has made it \na significant advancement in the field of machine learning \nand forecasting.\nPersonalization is one of the ultimate goals of modern \nmedicine [23]. To achieve this, individualized risk predic-\ntion for each patient is critical. In the current study, we \nutilized the developed transformer model for predicting \nthe prognosis in individual HCC patients undergoing RFA \nas the initial treatment. Notwithstanding the improved \npredictive performance of the transformer-based model \ndeveloped in this study relative to that of the deep learn-\ning model, however, the prediction accuracy of the model \nis still not adequately satisfactory. The accurate prognosis \nprediction in HCC patients receiving RFA treatment was \nlimited to fair to poor performance, with c-indices of 0.69 \nin the external validation site [ 24]. Lu et al. developed a \nprognostic nomogram for predicting the overall survival \nof HCC patients after RFA, and showed a c -index of 0.637 \nin the internal verification using the bootstrap method \n[25]. Accurate estimation of the survival in HCC patients \nundergoing RFA remains a challenge due to the significant \nFig. 2  Kaplan–Meier curves for survival after initial RFA in the different risk groups—categorized into two (Fig.  1a) and three (Fig.  1b) risk \ngroups using the transformer-based model\n136 Hepatology International (2024) 18:131–137\n1 3\nvariability of the clinical outcomes, which could also be \ninfluenced by non-hepatic comorbidities. Given that the \npredictive accuracy of machine learning models is influ-\nenced by the number of samples used for training [ 26], \nfurther research with larger sample sizes is necessary to \nenhance the accuracy of predictive models for clinical \napplications. Also, incorporating multiple heterogeneous \nforms of information, such as clinical data and imaging \nfindings, through a multimodal representation model [27], \ncould represent a valuable strategy to enhance the predic-\ntive performance.\nOur study had several limitations. A primary limitation \nof this study was its single-center design, which restricts the \ngeneralizability of the findings—the predictive model devel-\noped in this study may not be applicable to other clinical \nsettings. To confirm the general feasibility of the proposed \ntransformer model, additional validation in a multi-center \nsetting is necessary. Also, hospital volume was reported \nto be associated with the risk of mortality following RFA \n[28]. Therefore, the model can be expanded to include the \nhospital volume as a variable from the future multi-center \nstudy. Second, we have not publicly disseminated a web-\nbased tool that facilitates access to the developed machine \nlearning model. Consequently, the practical utilization of the \nmodel is currently precluded. What is significant, however, \nis that this is the first time that the transformer model has \nbeen demonstrated to work in the HCC field. Third, since \nthe current study focused on RFA, biopsy was not performed \nfor all cases, and therefore, the information regarding the \ndifferentiation of HCC is not available. Tumor location and \nshape of HCC were also important factors for treatment effi-\ncacy of RFA. The previous study showed an influence of \ntumor location on long-term outcomes following RFA. In \nthis study, HCCs located in peri-portal-vein or peri-hepatic \nvein were associated with lower recurrence-free survival \n[29]. However, these factors were not included in the current \nstudy. Since we included the patients with multiple lesions, \nincorporating information on tumor localization and shape \ninto machine learning models poses challenges due to the \nvarying dimensions of these variables across different num-\nber of lesions. And finally, differences exist in the etiology \nof HCC between the current real-world setting and the study \nsubject. The current study included patients who received \nradiofrequency treatment after 1999. Over the years, the \nprevalence of the underlying etiology of HCC has changed \ngreatly. Although, recently, the proportion of HCC patients \nwith non-viral etiologies has increased, reportedly account-\ning for about 30% of patients [ 30], only 20% of patients in \nthe current study were non-viral patients.\nIn conclusion, we developed and validated a novel trans-\nformer model for personalized risk prediction of HCC recur-\nrence/progression after RFA treatment. The current model \nhas the potential to offer a personalized and precise schema \nfor predicting the survival in HCC patients undergoing RFA \ntreatment.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplemen-\ntary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s12072- 023- 10585-y.\nAuthor contributions The 15 authors are justifiably credited with \nauthorship according to the authorship criteria.
