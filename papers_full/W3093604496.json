  "abstract": "Abstract Sex determination in tephritid fruit flies involves a signaling cascade of alternatively spliced genes. The Transformer (TRA) and Transformer-2 (TRA-2) complex establishes an autoregulatory loop switching sex-specific splicing of tra pre-mRNA in females.

We \nproposed that the zygotic tra loop is initiated in both female and male embryos before becoming \nautomatised or abolished by MoY, respectively.\nSexual reproduction is a key point for the continuation of multicellular eukaryotes. Males and females evolve into \nsexual dimorphism through the sexual selection  processes1. Sex-determination mechanisms are highly diverse, \nand they usually occur during early  development2. The sex determination of insects is one of the most diverse \nand well-characterised  systems3,4. Its evolutionarily divergent model constitutes three levels of sex-determining \n regulators4. The primary signals are variable among insect species. Most of their signaling mechanisms are still \nunknown, but the signals are relayed via alternative splicing of a conserved binary switch gene. This switch gene, \nencoded for a splicing regulator, relays similar alternative splicing messages to the highly conserved downstream \neffectors.\nTephritid fruit flies are in a very diverse dipteran family comprising at least 5,000  species\n5. Several of them \nare high profile pests, including Ceratitis capitata  (Mediterranean fruit fly), Bactrocera dorsalis  (oriental fruit \nfly), B. oleae (olive fruit fly), B. tryoni  (Queensland fruit fly), Anastrapha ludens (Mexican fruit fly), A. obliqua  \n(West Indian fruit fly), and A. suspensa (Caribbean fruit fly). Many sex-determining orthologues have been char-\nacterised to understand the developmental cascades which are also beneficial for determining new pest control \n strategies\n6–8. For instance, genetic sexing strains have been developed by employing modern genetic approaches \nfor pest control programs using the sterile insect technique (SIT)6,9–13.\nOPEN\nRegional R&D Training Center for Insect Biotechnology (RCIB), Department of Biotechnology, Faculty of Science, \nMahidol University, Rama VI Road, Bangkok 10400, Thailand. *email: sujinda.tha@mahidol.ac.th\n2\nVol:.(1234567890)Scientific Reports |        (2020) 10:17938  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-74856-6\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nRecently, the primary signal Maleness-on the-Y (MoY) has been discovered in C. capitata14. The MoY ortho-\nlogues were also characterised in many Bactrocera spp. such as B. dorsalis, B. oleae, and B. tryoni. Disruption or \noverexpression of CcMoY can feminise XY embryos or masculinise XX embryos, respectively. CcMoY modu -\nlates sex-specific splicing of transformer (tra) pre-mRNA14. In tephritid female flies, the tra and transformer-2 \n(tra-2) orthologues encode the TRA and TRA-2 proteins that later form a TRA/TRA-2 complex to maintain an \nautoregulatory loop of the female-specifically spliced tra transcript (traF)15–25. The Bdtra22–24 and Bdtra-222,23 were \npreviously characterised in B. dorsalis. The RNAi-mediated knock-down of any one of these genes generated only \nmales because the autoregulatory loop was disrupted. Likewise, the autoregulatory loop is disrupted by the pres-\nence of MoY orthologues in  males14. The TRA/TRA-2 complex also switches on the  DoublesexF protein  (DSXF) \nby regulating female-specific splicing of dsx pre-mRNA. The switching-off mode results in  DSXM because the \nabsence of the functional TRA/TRA-2 complex allows male-specific splicing of dsx pre-mRNA15–19,22–24.  DSXF and \n DSXM are highly conserved functional effectors in  insects26,27. They are transcriptional factors with a masculinised \nor feminised function for downstream genes, controlling somatic sexual  dimorphism26,28. The dsx orthologues \nstudied in several tephritid fruit flies (i.e., C. capitata29, B. tryoni30, B. oleae31, B. dorsalis32,33, B. correcta33, and A. \nobliqua34) are conserved, suggesting similar somatic sexual differentiation among them.\nIn a tephritid and remotely related insects, the TRA/TRA-2 complex switches were also found to control the \nsex-specific splicing of the other downstream effector gene, fruitless (fru), that confers the sexual behaviors of \n males18,35–38. However, the fru gene has not been characterised in detail among tephritid species. The molecular \nmechanisms of fru in sex determination were proposed based on non-tephritid  models35–41. The fru genes are \nvery complex loci encoding sex-specific and non sex-specific transcriptional factor  isoforms42,43. FRU proteins \ngenerally contain a dimerisation-interface domain called the BTB (Broad-complex, Tramtrack and Bric-a-brac) \ndomain and one alternative  C2H2 zinc finger  domain35,36,44,45. Each of the fru  orthologues has many putative \ntranscripts derived from any one of the alternative promoter-derived 5′ sex- and non sex-specific exons, which \nconnect to four to five common exons and then connect to any one of the 3′  alternative zinc-finger encoding \n exons35,36,38–41. Notably, the sex-specifically spliced transcripts are only processed from the most distal promoter \n(P1) derived pre-mRNA in many non-tephritid  species35,36,38,39,41. In Drosophila melanogaster, the non sex-specific \nFRU isoforms have developmental functions. They are translated from P2 to P4  transcripts46–48.\nIn this study, we report the gene structure and expression of tra-2 and fru  orthologues in B. dorsalis  and B. \ncorrecta. The RNAi knockdown experiments showed that BdTRA controls the sex-specific splicing of Bdtra M, \nBddsxM, and BdfruM transcripts in pseudomales. In addition, a comprehensive sex-determination cascade was \ninvestigated from the developmental expression profiles of MoY, tra, tra-2, dsx, and fru in single embryos, larvae, \npupae, and adults. These results likely ascertained the time frames of critical sex-determining events in these \nBactrocera fruit flies.\nResults\nB. dorsalis and B. correcta transformer‑2 (tra‑2) orthologues. Full-length transcripts of B. dorsalis \ntra-2 (Bdtra-2) and B. correcta tra-2 (Bctra-2) are approximately 1.2 kilobases (kb) and 1.4 kb, respectively, in \nboth sexes.

The open reading \nframes (ORF) of Bdtra-2 and Bctra-2 are 753 bp, encoding for a predicted polypeptide of 251 amino acids with \n98% identity (Supplementary Table S1). The RNA recognition motif (RRM) region of BdTRA-2 and BcTRA-2 \nwere identical within Bactrocera species and highly conserved across the tephritidae family (Supplementary \nFig. S1). The nucleotide sequences of the Bdtra-2 are almost identical to the previously characterised Bdtra-2\n22; \nhowever, 29 bp-longer and 88 bp-shorter sequences were found at the 5′- and 3′-UTRs, respectively.\nB. dorsalis and B. correcta fruitless (fru) orthologues. A classical PCR-based approach was combined \nwith available bioinformatics tools and genomic databases to predict the putative exon–intron organisation of \nthe fru gene. The 5′-, 3′-RACEs and RT-PCRs were performed to assemble long transcripts of B. dorsalis fru  \n(Bdfru) (GenBank Acc.

Both orthologues consist of three com-\nponents (i.e., alternative P1 to P4 derived exons, the middle common exons, and four alternative 3′ ending exons \n(Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. S2). For B. dorsalis , the genomic sequence is available in the database; cDNA \nsequences of Bdfru transcripts were aligned against the genomic scaffold (GenBank Acc. No. NW_011876307) \nto analyse the gene organisation. The results suggested that the Bdfru  gene structure is very large in size, span-\nFigure 2.

The schematic drawings \nshow (a) all possibilities for alternative splicing of fru transcripts and gene organisation of (b) Bdfru and (c) \nBcfru (not to scale). The fru transcripts contain one of the four alternative 5′ exon blocks (i.e., sex-specific, U1, \nU2–U4, and U3 blocks), the common exons (i.e., C1 to C5 exons), and four alternative 3′ ends (i.e., ZnF A to \nZnF D exons). P1 signifies the most distal promoter; its transcripts begin with a male-specific exon (M) and \npotential female-specific exon (F) as shown in dark gray and light gray boxes, respectively. P2 to P4 express \nnon sex-specific transcripts which start with untranslated exons (U1–U4) as shown in the white boxes. The five \ncommon exons (yellow boxes) are the BTB domain coding exons (C1–C2) and the connecting exons (C3–C5). \nThe zinc-finger encoding exons (ZnF A, ZnF B, ZnF C, and ZnF D) are in the green boxes. Boxes and lines \nrepresent exons and introns, respectively. Two putative translational start codons (ATG) are presented in the M \nand C1 exons. The potential translational in-frame stop codons are indicated by small black squares. The white \nand coloured parts in the exons represent untranslated and translated regions, respectively. The lengths of exons \nand putative introns are shown in black and gray numbers, respectively. The connection between F and common \nexons (dashed line) is still hypothetical because the RT-PCR experimental results were not positive.\n4\nVol:.(1234567890)Scientific Reports |        (2020) 10:17938  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-74856-6\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nning approximately 330 kb of genomic sequence (Fig. 2b). The genome sequence of B. correcta is not available. \nThe putative Bcfru structure was thus predicted based on cDNA sequence and conceptual amino acid sequence \nalignments of Bcfru and Bdfru transcripts, putative donor–acceptor exon sequences, and conceptual amino acid \nposition. The results showed the identical pattern of putative donor–acceptor nucleotide sequences on exons and \nconceptual amino acid sequences. This suggested that the predicted exon structure of Bcfru gene is similar to that \nof Bdfru gene (Fig.  2c and Supplementary Fig. S2). However, the availability of B. correcta genomic sequences \nwould bring certainty to the proposed Bcfru gene organisation.\nAt the 5′ portions of the Bdfru and Bcfru genes, five putative exons (male-specific exon (M) and untranslated \nexons (U1, U2, U3, and U4)) were found and spliced to the middle common exons in four different patterns \n(Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. S2). The genomic location of the four alternative 5′ exons are located many kb \napart. This suggested that there are at least four putative promoters. The most distal promoter of Bdfru transcripts \nbegin with an M exon, which is located 292 kb upstream of the C1 exon and appears to be a male-specifically \nspliced transcript (P1 transcripts) (Fig. 2b). The other three patterns are non sex-specific transcripts as P2 tran-\nscripts begin with the U1 exon located 249 kb upstream of the C1 exon, P3 transcripts begin with the U2 exon \nlocated 57 kb upstream of the C1 exon, and P4 transcripts begin with the U3 exon located 49 kb upstream of the \nC1 exon. The common C1–C2 and C3–C5 exons encode for the BTB domain and its connecting polypeptides, \nrespectively (Fig. 2a). Additional complexity arises from the presence of four alternative 3′ end exons, which are \nzinc-finger encoding exons (ZnF A, ZnF B, ZnF C, and ZnF D) (Fig. 2a). The 3′ RACE and RT-PCR approaches \nwere used to analyse the connection between each of the P1 to P4 derived exons and the alternative zinc-finger \nexons of Bdfru and Bcfru (Supplementary Table S2). The alternative ZnF A, ZnF B, and ZnF C exons were part \nof the P1 transcripts whereas the P2 and P3 transcripts consisted of all possible alternative zinc-finger exons. \nThe P4 transcripts included the alternative ZnF A, ZnF C, and ZnF D exons. In addition, the M exon provides \nan extra start codon in the ORF resulting in an additional 64 amino acids at the amino terminal end of male-\nspecifically spliced P1 transcripts (Supplementary Fig. S3). The other four exons (U1 to U4) are untranslated \nregions; therefore, ORFs of the P2, P3, and P4 transcripts may be translated with the putative start codon located \nin the BTB coding exon (C1).\nIn silico analysis of the female‑specific exon and its cis‑regulatory elements in Bdfru and Bcfru \ntranscripts. To identify the sex-specific transcripts that were potentially derived from the P1 promoter, the \nforward primer located on the M exon and the reverse primer located on the common BTB exon C2 were used. \nA longer amplified product was expected to be detected in female flies due to the presence of a female-specific \nexon as reported in the other dipteran  insects\n35–41. By contrast, in B. dorsalis and B. correcta, the amplified RT-\nPCR product was only observed in males. The bioinformatics approach was then used to identify the putative \nfemale-specific (F) exon and its cis-regulatory elements from the genomic scaffold. The 1.9 kb region down-\nstream of the M exon was available in the B. dorsalis genomic scaffold (GenBank Acc. No. NW_011876307.1). \nThe putative TRA/TRA-2 binding sites and multiple in-frame stop codons were in silico identified in this region \n(Supplementary Fig. S4). Both components were found to be clustered in an approximately 400 bp stretch adja-\ncent to the M exon. PCR was performed using genomic DNA templates to verify this 400-bp region in B. dorsalis \nand B. correcta. The putative TRA/TRA-2 binding sites and multiple in-frame stop codons were found in B. \ndorsalis as expected and also in B. correcta (Supplementary Fig. S4a and S4b). The putative TRA/TRA-2 binding \nsites of Bdfru and Bcfru genes were comparable to the consensus sequence of TRA/TRA-2 binding sites located \nin the female-specific exon of the fru genes from the other insect species (Supplementary Fig. S4c). The in silico \nanalysis suggested that the 400-bp region has the structural features of the putative F exon of Bdfru  and Bcfru \ntranscripts.\nRT-PCR experiments were subsequently performed to prove the existence of the F exon (Supplementary \nFig. S5). The cDNA templates were prepared from male and female adult heads of both species. Three forward \nprimers (located on the M exon, putative junction of the M and F exons, and the putative F exon) were indi-\nvidually paired with a reverse primer (located on the putative F exon) (Supplementary Fig. S5a). The RT-PCR \nexperiment showed a female-specific band when these primer combinations had been used (Supplementary \nFig. S5b). This result suggested the existence of an F exon which is adjacent to 3 ′ end of the M exon. The con -\nnection between the F exon, and the common exon C2 could not be validated by the use of a C2-specific reverse \nprimer in RT-PCR experiments (Supplementary Fig. S5d). Taken together, the in silico analysis and RT-PCR \nexperiments suggested that the female-specific Bdfru  and Bcfru  transcripts contain potential in-frame stop \ncodons that result in prematurely truncated female-specific ORF .\nBdtra gene regulated sex‑specifically spliced Bddsx and Bdfru transcripts. The endogenous \nBdtra transcripts were knocked down in preblastoderm embryos by the microinjection of Bdtra  dsRNA. The \nbrown- and white-pupae genetic sexing strain (Salaya1) of B. dorsalis  was used to identify adult pseudomales \n(males emerging from white pupae) (Fig. 3). Male-specifically spliced Bdtra, Bddsx, and Bdfru transcripts were \ndetected in the same adult pseudomales although the female-specific isoforms of the Bdtra and Bddsx were \nstill observed in contrast to the sex-specific patterns observed in the male- and female-wild-types as well as the \nBdtra dsRNA treated brown-pupae males (Fig. 4). Bdtra-2 transcripts were detected in all cases. All of the adult \npseudomales had male genitalia and mostly abnormal testes (Fig. 3). The results suggested that Bdtra RNAi can \nchange the expression of Bddsx and Bdfru and generate masculinisation of the female embryos.\nThe expression profiles of sex‑determining genes during early embryonic, larval, pupal, and \nadult stages in the males and females of B. dorsalis and B. correcta. The early development stages \nof B. dorsalis and B. correcta embryos were very similar when observed from 0 to 9 h after egg laying (h AEL) \n5\nVol.:(0123456789)Scientific Reports |        (2020) 10:17938  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-74856-6\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n(Supplementary Fig. S6). The pole cells and syncytial blastoderm appeared at 3 and 4 h AEL, respectively. Sub-\nsequently, the cellular blastoderm seemed to be completed by 7 to 8 h AEL.\nThe expression profiles of MoY, tra, tra-2, dsx, fru, and slow as molasses (slam) were studied in unfertilised \neggs and during early embryonic development (1 to 12 h AEL) as well as in larval, pupal, and adult stages (Fig. 5). \nGene- and/or sex-specific transcript primers were used for RT-PCR from single embryos, larvae, pupae, and \nadults. The embryos, larvae, and pupae were sexed by PCR using genomic DNA templates with Y-specific prim-\ners (Supplementary Table S6).\nIn B. dorsalis, the expression of Bdslam began in 2 h AEL zygotes and continued throughout the adult stage \n(Fig. 5a). The slam seemed to be the first zygotically expressed gene. The presence of female-specifically spliced \nBdtra (BdtraF) and Bddsx (BddsxF), and Bdtra-2 transcripts in unfertilised eggs shows that these transcripts are \ncontributed maternally. The continued presence of the transcripts in developing embryos indicates zygotic acti-\nvation of transcription of these genes. The expression of the MoY transcript was only observed in male samples \nbeginning from 3 h AEL embryos, barely visible in larvae, and disappeared in pupae and adults. The combination \nof Bdtra\nF, zygotic male-specifically spliced Bdtra  transcripts (BdtraM), and their intermediate transcripts were \nfirstly observed in both male and female samples at 5 h AEL. The intermediate transcripts consisted of three \npossible partial sequences of male-specific exon(s) (Supplementary Fig. S7). This observation became more \nobvious at 6 to 7 h AEL. This suggested that the activation of the zygotic tra loop had occurred in both sexes. In \n8 h AEL embryos, the same combinations of the Bdtra\nF and M and intermediate transcripts was observed in males. \nConversely, the BdtraF transcripts were only a major product in female embryos, suggesting higher efficacy of the \nzygotic tra loop. Sex-specific splicing patterns of the Bdtra gene arose in 9 and 10 h AEL embryos. The female-\nspecifically spliced pattern continued to at least 12 h AEL and in larvae, pupae, and adults. The male-specifically \nspliced counterpart also followed this trend, except that the mixture of Bdtra\nF and M and intermediate transcripts \nreappeared once in the 11 h AEL male zygotes. The expression of the zygotic male-specifically spliced Bddsx  \ntranscript (BddsxM) appeared at the beginning of gastrulation (8 to 10 h AEL) and was detected at all later stages \nin males. The sex-specific splicing pattern of the Bddsx  gene was established in the larvae, pupae, and adults. \nThe male-specifically spliced Bdfru  transcript ( BdfruM) derived from the P1 promoter was observed in male \nsamples from larval, pupal, and adult stages, but not in the embryonic stage. Notably, a non-specific RT-PCR \namplicon was observed and sequenced. It was found to be against predicted B. dorsalis  protein peanut and E3 \nubiquitin-protein ligase genes in embryos when BLAST was used. The expression profiles of the other Bdfru  \ntranscripts derived from the P2, P3, and P4 promoters were also absent in the unfertilised eggs and embryos \nFigure 3.

Unlike the male-specifically spliced P1 \ntranscripts, the other Bdfru  transcripts were bisexually expressed in larvae, pupae, and adults. Nonetheless, all \nBdfru transcript isoforms appeared during development later than the other sex-determining genes. All sex-\ndetermining orthologous genes from B. correcta  showed similar expression profiles to those of the B. dorsalis  \nspecies (Fig. 5b, Supplementary Fig. S7, and S8a). However, the appearance of Bcslam and BcdsxM occurred an \nhour after those of the B. dorsalis.\nDiscussion\nThe molecular organisations of Bdtra-2 and Bctra-2 are almost identical to both the previously characterised \nBdtra-2\n22,23 and orthologues from other tephritid fruit  flies18–20,25, including Bactrocera spp.21. TRA-2 is a constitu-\ntive component required for TRA/TRA-2 complex for turning on the sex-determining-autoregulatory loop that \ngenerates female-specifically spliced tra transcripts in  tephritids\n18–20,22. The TRA-2 proteins have two conserved \nRS-rich regions and an RRM domain which were proposed to be under the purifying selection  process19,25 (Sup-\nplementary Table S1 and Fig. S1). This suggested the roles of TRA-2 in spliceosome  formation49,51,52.\nThis work is the first study of fru genome organisation with various splicing patterns and expression profiles \nduring development in tephritid fruit flies. The Bdfru and Bcfru orthologues are also one of the longest and most \ncomplex genes. The Bdfru gene spans approximately 330 kb. There are probably many transcripts with conserved \nsplicing patterns, as in many insect species: D. melanogaster 35,36, Anopheles gambiae39, Aedes aegypti41, Musca \ndomestica38, and Nasonia vitripennis40. Alternative promoters can generate various 5′ exons that connect to the \ncontinuous array of four or five common exons before splicing with one of the different 3′ zinc-finger encoding \nexons.\nThe overall deduced amino acid sequences of the BdFRU and BcFRU are generally conserved, as in D. mela-\nnogaster. The BTB domain is the most conserved characteristic of all FRU  proteins53,54. It is encoded near the \nbeginning of the C1 exon. This BTB domain is an evolutionarily conserved protein–protein interaction domain \nfound throughout the evolutionary lineages from Drosophila to  mammal\n44. Many alternative zinc-finger domains \nfor different FRU proteins are less conserved. On the other hand, a high degree of polymorphism was found in \namino acid sequences encoded by the male-specific exon. This male-specific sequence is still highly conserved \nwithin the family (i.e., tephritidae). This suggests the strong adaptive divergence of sexual behaviors and may \nconfer male-specific transcriptional regulatory roles of  FRU\nM in different insect taxa.\nThe P1 derived primary transcripts of Bdfru  and Bcfru are sex-specifically spliced at the 5′  exons as in the \ncase of D. melanogaster 35,36, An. gambiae39, Ae. Aegypti41, M. domestica38, and N. vitripennis 40. The male- and \nFigure 4.  Expression analysis of Bdtra dsRNA treated and wild-type B. dorsalis. RT-PCRs of Bdtra, Bdtra-2, \nBddsx, and Bdfru were performed to analyse the switch of splicing patterns from female to male resulting from \nthe masculinisation by Bdtra dsRNA injection. The expression of Bdgapdh is used as a positive control. The \nexpression patterns of the wild-type brown-pupae (BP) males and white-pupae (WP) females were compared \nwith the Bdtra dsRNA treated brown-pupae males and white-pupae pseudomales. The primers used in this \nexperiment are shown in Supplementary Tables S5 and S6. The full-length gels are presented in Supplementary \nFig. S9.\n7\nVol.:(0123456789)Scientific Reports |        (2020) 10:17938  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-74856-6\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nfemale-specific exons are adjacent. TRA/TRA-2 binding sites located in the female-specific exon suggested an \nalternative splicing mechanism which selected the 5′ splice site located at the end of the female-specific exon. The \nbinding of TRA/TRA-2 complex hinders the formation of the spliceosome complex at the male-specific splice site \nin D. melanogaster\n37. The female-specific FRU protein was truncated because of its in-frame stop codons in the \nfemale-specific  exon36–41,45,46. Transcripts connecting the female-specific exon and the common C1 exon could \nnot be confirmed by RT-PCR experiments because the female-specifically spliced transcript may be expressed \nFigure 5.  Expression analysis of sex-determining genes during the early stages of embryogenesis and other \ndevelopmental stages in (a) B. dorsalis and (b) B. correcta. The cDNA samples were prepared from unfertilised \neggs, embryos (1 to 12 h AEL), larvae, pupae, and adults. The presence of the slam gene indicates the zygotic \ntranscription period in embryogenesis. Five sex-determining genes, MoY, tra, tra-2, dsx, and fru, were studied \nby RT-PCR analysis. In B. dorsalis (a), the male- and the female-specifically spliced transcripts (traM and traF) \nare 980 bp and 626 bp, respectively. In B. correcta (b), the male- and the female-specifically spliced transcripts \n(traM and traF) are 951 bp and 599 bp, respectively. For the dsx gene, the female-specifically spliced dsx transcript \n(dsxF) is 677 bp whereas the male-specific dsx transcript (dsxM) is 484 bp in both species. The male-specifically \nexpressed fru transcript (fruM) appears in male samples at a length of 506 bp. Unexpected bands are the result of \nnon-specific binding of primers. The gapdh gene was used as a positive control. The negative control was setup \nin the absence of RTase. The primers used in this experiment are shown in Supplementary Table S5 and S6. The \nfull-length gels are presented in Supplementary Fig. S10.\n8\nVol:.(1234567890)Scientific Reports |        (2020) 10:17938  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-74856-6\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nat a low level. It was found that the expression level of the fru F transcripts were lower than the fru M transcripts \nin D. melanogaster46 and Ae. Aegypti41.\nWe propose that Bdfru  and Bddsx  are regulated by Bdtra  in the sex-determination pathway as previously \nproposed in the  Medfly15,18. This is based on the presence of TRA/TRA-2 binding sites in their female-specific \n exons22–24,32,33 (in this study) and the sex-determining gene splicing analysis in the pseudomales made from Bdtra \nRNAi. The same regulatory roles of Bctra to the Bcfru and Bcdsx genes can be implicated based on the conserved \nsequences and gene  structures24,33 (Fig. 2) and developmental expression profiles (Fig. 5).\nThe expression profiles of sex-determining genes in B. dorsalis and B. correcta begin with maternal traF and \ntra-2 transcripts. The maternal-to-zygotic transition of these genes may have occurred at 2–3 h AEL as indicated \nby the expression of the zygotic cellularisation slam  gene. In B. jarvisi and C. capitata , the expression of the \northologs of the slam gene were detected in embryos as early as 4 h  AEL21,55. The Y-linked BdMoY and BcMoY \ngenes also started to express around the 3 h AEL in male embryos. In C. capitata, the CcMoY transcription was \nalso detected between 2–3 h  AEL14. All of these MoY  orthologues continued to express in males during the \nembryonic stages, less so in the larvae, and disappeared in the pupae and  adults14 (in this study).\nThe expressions of zygotic Bdtra and Bctra genes were firstly indicated by the appearance of the BdtraM and \nBctraM transcripts at 5 h AEL for both male and female embryos. However, these transcripts were found in hetero-\ngeneity, i.e., all together with BdtraF and BctraF and their intermediate transcripts. The heterogeneous pattern of \nRNA splicing was equally extended from 5 to 8 h AEL in both sexes. This finding is consistent with the expression \npattern of Cctra during the same developmental  period\n55. It is hypothesised that the activation of the zygotic tra \nloop occurred in all embryos during this period. For the XX embryos, the accumulation of TRA/TRA-2 complex \nlevel above a certain threshold would generate a tra -autoregulatory loop. TRA and TRA-2 are serine/arginine \n(SR) type splicing regulators which operate under threshold  dependency\n56. The presence of BdtraF and BctraF and \nthe absence of BdtraM, BctraM, and their intermediate transcripts suggested that the level of TRA/TRA-2 complex \nwas high enough to complete the automatisation of the tra loop from the 9 h AEL developmental point onward \nin females. In the case of the XY embryos, the non-autonomous zygotic tra loop was later disrupted by the sup-\npression of the MoY gene. The appearance of mostly BdtraM and BctraM transcripts suggested the breakdown of \nthe tra loop in males beginning at 9 h AEL. This finding is supported by a new discovery of an autosomal derived \nmicroRNA, miRNA-1-3p, that is required for male determination of B. dorsalis57. The miRNA-1-3p is involved \nin the suppression of Bdtra transcripts by targeting 3′ UTR. The relative expression of this miRNA-1-3p is also \nsignificantly increased and male-biased during the same critical period of the Bdtra loop breakdown process, i.e., \nfrom 6 to 9 h post oviposition at 28 °C. The microRNA is an example of intermediate male determiners. Further \nbioinformatics and molecular studies that shed light on how MoY relays the instruction to disrupt the tra loop \nwill be focused on the period of 5 to 9 h AEL in B. dorsalis and B. correcta embryos.\nThe Bddsx and Bcdsx genes are maternally transcribed. The Bddsx\nF knockdown experiment resulted in an \ninterruption of yolk protein  (yp) expression in adults and led to a significant reduction of ovary size, number \nof oocytes, and malformation of reproductive  organs32. The presence of Bddsx F and Bcdsx F transcripts were \nobserved in both sex embryos up to at least 12 h AEL.  DSXF may be used in the expression of genes related to \nthe nourishment of embryos such as the yp  gene58. A similar finding showed that the BjdsxF transcript was also \nexpressed in both sex embryos at sometime between 1 to 9 h  AEL21. In the medfly, the CcdsxF transcription was \nmaternally derived and also detected at 4 h AEL in all embryos. However, the CcdsxF disappeared from 5 to 9 h \nAEL and reappeared as a pattern of sex-specifically spliced Ccdsx M and CcdsxF transcripts in male and female \nembryos, respectively, at 10 h  AEL55. This indicated that the zygotic expression of the Ccdsx  gene had begun \naround this time. The first zygotic expression of Bddsx and Bcdsx genes were also in evidence at 8 and 9 h AEL, \nrespectively, when the BddsxM and BcdsxM transcripts were detected. In B. jarvisi , a high number of dsxM tran-\nscripts was detected after 6 h  AEL21.\nIf the presence of Bddsx F and Bcdsx F transcripts were zygotically expressed in male embryos during the \nperiod of 9 to 12 h AEL, it would result from the binding between TRA/TRA-2 complex proteins and the dsx  \npre-mRNA. However, there is evidence that the availability of functional TRA/TRA-2 complex protein is not \nenough to generate BdtraF and BctraF transcripts from their pre-mRNAs for the same duration. This suggests that \nTRA/TRA-2 binding complexity at the respective pre-mRNAs of the tra and dsx orthologues are different. Ruiz \net al.17 proposed, due to the putative cis-regulatory elements on sex-specific exons of tra  and dsx pre-mRNAs, \nthat TRA plays a dual role in the sex-determination pathway of tephritids. The putative TRA/TRA-2 complex \nbinding sites on the female-specific exon of dsx pre-mRNA suggested the requirement of simpler components \nfor the formation of an enhancing complex. In contrast, additional TRA-2 and SR protein(s) may be required \nfor binding at the putative silencing elements on the male-specific exon(s) of tra pre-mRNA\n17.\nThe first appearance of BddsxM and BcdsxM transcripts in cellular blastoderm embryos (from 7 to 9 h AEL, \nsupplementary Fig. S6) suggested the presence of both effector proteins,  DSXM and  DSXF. This indicated that \nsex-specific transcription of DSX-regulated genes could begin in the embryo. However, the sex-specifically \nspliced patterns were distinctively observed in larval, pupal, and adult stages where sexual dimorphism are well \ndeveloped and require regulation of later sexual differentiation genes.\nThe fru gene is the other downstream effector required for later sexual differentiation. The developmental \nexpression of the P1 derived Bdfru and Bcfru transcripts were detected later in the larval, pupal, and adult stages \nsimilar to that of D. melanogaster\n36 and Ae. aegypti41. In D. melanogaster males, default splicing of P1 transcripts \nare expressed in a small fraction of  neurons36,46,59–61. This results in functional  FRUM proteins playing transcrip-\ntional factor roles which determine male courtship and  orientation59,60,62. This suggests that the  FRUM effector \ninfluences male development of neurons and sexual behaviors after the embryonic stage. The P2 to P4 derived \nBdfru and Bcfru transcripts were also detected in a similar developmental stages to the P1 transcript. They may \nhave a non sex-specific developmental function as found in D. melanogaster\n36,46–48. Further functional studies \nof the fru genes could be complex because there are a lot of fru transcript variants. However, the function of the \n9\nVol.:(0123456789)Scientific Reports |        (2020) 10:17938  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-74856-6\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nfruM transcripts would be significantly related to the sex-determination pathways, sexual development of the \ninsect brain, and sexual behavior.\nThe molecular study of Bdtra-2 and Bdfru genes have made it possible to investigate every player in the general \nsex-determination cascades of tephritid fruit  flies4: BdMoY14, Bdtra22–24, Bdtra-222,23 (also in this work), Bddsx32,33 \nand Bdfru in B. dorsalis. The developmental expression profile analyses can outline the following critical time \npoints. The presence of maternal Bdtra transcripts could provide BdTRA proteins to initiate the autoregulatory \nloop. The Bdtra-2 transcript is continuously expressed throughout development as found in a previous  study22. \nThe Y-linked male-determiner, BdMoY, starts expressing instructions from 3 h AEL until the larval stage. The \nzygotic tra loop activation becomes apparant in both sex embryos at 5 h AEL. The first male-specific splicing \npattern of Bdtra suggests that the BdMOY protein has completed the process of Bdtra loop disruption at 9 h AEL. \nIn addition, the Bdtra autoregulatory loop is fully functional due to the disappearance of BdtraM and intermedi-\nate transcripts from 8 to 9 h AEL in female embryos. When the binary Bdtra  is switched OFF , it transduces the \nfirst signal to the BddsxM effector at 8 h AEL although the appearance of the BddsxF transcript is present in male \nembryos until at least 12 h AEL. The expression of the  BdFRUM effector is not apparent in embryos but only in \nlater development. The comparative studies of all sex-determining orthologues from B. correcta  imply similar \nsex-determination  schemes24,33 (in this study). Detailed study of sex-determination cascades can be focused \non more specific times in embryonic and sexual development of tephritid fruit flies. Fundamental mechanisms \n(e.g., how MoY  breaks down the tra  loop; how the autoregulatory loop of zygotic tra  is established; how tra  \nswitches ON and OFF sex-specific splicing of dsx and fru  pre-mRNAs; and how fru  + neurons program male \nsexual behaviors) can be explained with better resolution. Novel intermediates and accessory proteins required \nfor sex-determination can be screened and validated using bioinformatics and genome editing approaches. \nComprehensive understanding of sex-determination may lead to new genetic tools and the improvement of \ninsect pest control strategies in the high profile key pests, B. dorsalis and B. correcta\n63.\nMethods\nFruit fly strains. The laboratory strains, B. dorsalis (Phayathai1 strain) and B. correcta (Phayathai2 strain), \nwere used for the isolation of fru  and tra-2 genes and the expression analyses of sex-determining genes in dif-\nferent developmental stages. The B. dorsalis Salaya1 genetic sexing strain was used for the RNAi experiment of \nBdtra. This strain has sexual phenotypes of brown/white pupae, with males and females emerging from brown \nand white pupae,  respectively64. The fruit flies were reared at 25 °C, with 13 L: 11 D cycles, and around 70% rela-\ntive humidity (RH) at Regional R&D Training Center for Insect Biotechnology, Mahidol University.\nEgg and embryo collection. Two different fruit fly cages were set up for harvesting unfertilised eggs and \nembryos from sexually mature (14-day old) virgin and mated females, respectively. The induction of egg oviposi-\ntion was done by putting a pretested oviposition chamber containing guava juice into the fruit fly cages for one \nhour. The experimental batches of eggs and embryos were harvested from each new oviposition chamber after \nbeing left in the cage for 10 min. All samples were incubated at 25 °C and 70% RH. The first batch of eggs was \nincubated for 48 h to validate virginity and fertilisation of the females from embryo hatching. A series of egg \nbatches were subsequently and independently collected. Each of these egg batches was incubated according to \nonly one specific time point (i.e., representing individuals taken every hour from 1 to 12 h AEL).\nEmbryo preparation for RNA isolation. Collected embryos were dechorionated in 3% sodium \nhypochlorite solution and washed in DEPC-treated water. Single embryos were individually transferred to \na microcentrifuge tube (1.5 ml) before immediate grinding in 100 μl TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, USA). The \nhomogenates were kept at − 80 °C until the RNA isolation step.\nRNA and DNA isolation from adult samples. Genomic DNA was individually extracted according to \nBaruffi et al.65. Total RNA was isolated from 2-day old flies using TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer′s \ninstructions.\nRNA and DNA isolation from single embryos, larvae and pupae. Parallel RNA and genomic DNA \nextractions were carried out when using single embryos, larvae and pupae. Total RNA was isolated from each \nsample using TRIzol reagent as per the instructions from the manufacturer. During the RNA isolation, genomic \nDNA was extracted from the interphase and the organic phase of the TRIzol/chloroform  mix\n21. The RNA pre-\ncipitation required an additional 10 µg of RNase-free glycogen (Thermo Scientific, USA) for single embryos. \nThe resuspended RNA solution was evaluated using NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, USA).\nIsolation of tra‑2 and fru orthologues. For B. dorsalis and B. correcta tra-2 genes, the primers were \ndesigned from the conserved CDS of Bactrocera  spp. and C. capitata tra-2 genes (GenBank Acc. No. are pre-\nsented in Supplementary Table S3) to achieve the full transcript of Bdtra-2 and Bctra-2 genes. One microgram \nof total RNA from adult males and females was converted to the first-strand cDNA using SMARTer RACE 5′/3′ \nKit (Takara, USA) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. One-tenth of 5′- and 3′-RACE-Ready cDNA \nsamples were subsequently used as templates for RT-PCR and 5′ and 3′ RACEs with gene-specific primers. Semi-\nnested RT-PCRs were performed to derive a more specific amplification according to SMARTer RACE 5′/3′ Kit. \nThe negative controls were also performed by excluding reverse transcriptase. The tra-2 gene structures were \nassembled based on PCR experiments using three pairs of PCR primers that were derived from Bdtra-2 and \nBctra-2 full-transcripts and genomic DNA templates. The long Bdtra-2 and Bctra-2 cDNA and genomic DNA \n10\nVol:.(1234567890)Scientific Reports |        (2020) 10:17938  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-74856-6\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nsequences were deposited to GenBank (Supplementary Table S3). The exon/intron junctions were deduced from \nthese sequence alignments. A list of PCR primers in the tra-2 studies can be found in Supplementary Table S4.\nTotal RNA from freshly emerged adult heads of both sexes was used in the study of Bdfru  and Bcfru tran -\nscripts. Several gene-specific primer pairs were used to amplify Bdfru  and Bcfru cDNA based on conserved \nsequences that encoded the BTB domain and four zinc-finger domains of the fru  orthologues. These primers \nwere designed from predicted fru  transcripts in the transcriptome of many tephritid species and M. domestica \nfru transcripts (GenBank Acc. Nos. are presented in Supplementary Table S3). Bdfru and Bcfru common (C1 to \nC4) exon-encoded sequences were identified from the gene-specific RT-PCR using primers derived from the \nBTB coding sequence and its 3′ adjacent (Supplementary Fig. S2b and S2d). Four alternative 3′  exon-encoded \ncDNA sequences were amplified from the zinc-finger domain (ZnF A, ZnF B, ZnF C, and ZnF D) derived primers \n(Supplementary Fig. S2b and S2d). Four alternative 5′ exon sequences were isolated from 5′ RACE experiments \nusing reverse primers derived from the homologous sequence of the C3 exon and the male-specific exon of Mdfru \nand Ccfru, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S2a and S2c). Similarly, the four alternative 3′ exon sequences were \namplified from the 3′ RACE experiments using forward primers derived from the homologous sequence of the \nC4 exon of Mdfru  (Supplementary Fig. S2a and S2c). The 5′ - and 3′-RACE methods were done as previously \ndescribed. The male-specific exon was identified by RT-PCR using a forward primer derived from the male-\nspecific Ccfru sequence and gene-specific reverse primer derived from a homologous sequence of the C2 exon of \nMdfru. The putative female-specific exon was amplified using specific primers derived from the available 1.9 kb \ngenomic sequence adjacently downstream to the male-specific exon in the B. dorsalis genomic scaffold (GenBank \nAcc. No. NW_011876307). Intron/exon junctions of all isolated Bdfru transcripts were analysed by blasting them \nto the available B. dorsalis genomic scaffold (GenBank Acc. No. NW_011876307). The cDNA sequences of long \nBdfru and Bcfru transcripts were deposited to GenBank (Supplementary Table S3). All primers used in the fru  \ngene studies are described in Supplementary Table S4.\nRT‑PCR analyses of sex‑determining genes during early embryonic development and later \nstages. Sexual identification of single embryo, larval, and pupal samples were molecularly identified by \ngenomic PCR using Y-specific primers which were designed based on sequences such as the MoY  orthologue14. \nA glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) gene-specific PCR was used to control false negative sam-\nples. Up to 300 ng of total RNA from single embryos, larvae, pupae, and adults were reverse transcribed into \nthe first strand cDNA using ImProm-II Reverse Transcriptase (Promega, USA), following the manufacture′s \ninstructions. One-tenth of the initial reverse transcription reaction was used as a template for RT-PCR using \ngene-specific primers. For each sample, the negative control of RT-PCR was performed by excluding the \nreverse transcriptase. The gapdh  positive control system was also carried out in the RT-PCR. Slam , a zygoti-\ncally expressed cellularisation gene, was used as an early developmental  marker\n21,55. Therefore, the 2 to 3 h AEL \nembryos or older without detectable slam  were discarded. Relative locations of gene-specific primers to each \nsex-determining gene were schematically plotted in Supplementary Table S5. These primer sequences are listed \nin Supplementary Table S6. All RT-PCR experiments gave the same electrophoretic banding patterns when they \nwere repeated using cDNA templates of different individuals.\nBdtra RNAi experiment. Approximately 1.1  kb dsRNA of the Bdtra  gene was synthesised by in  vitro \ntranscription with T7 RNA polymerase using the MEGAscript Kit (Ambion, USA). Embryos were prepared \nfrom the B. dorsalis  Salaya1 genetic sexing strain, whose sexual phenotypes can be separated by pupal col-\nour  dimorphism\n64. One μg/μl of Bdtra  dsRNA was microinjected at the posterior end of precellular blasto-\nderm embryos. The RNAi-treated individuals were reared until adult emergence. Wild-type male and female \nadults emerged from brown and white pupae, respectively. The white-pupae males were therefore categorised as \n pseudomales\n24. The genitalia and testes of the wild-type males and pseudomales were compared under a micro-\nscope. The sex-specific splicing pattern of Bdtra, Bdtra-2, Bddsx, and Bdfru were carried out using the previously \ndescribed RT-PCR conditions in two pseudomales (randomly selected). The sex-specific splicing patterns of \nthese genes were compared to the wild-type males and females as well as the RNAi-treated wild-type males.\nMolecular cloning and DNA sequencing of PCR amplification products. The specific amplicon \nwas purified with the GF-1 AmbiClean Kit (Vivantis, Malaysia). The products were subsequently cloned into \nthe pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, USA) according to the manufacturer′s instructions. The recombinant plas-\nmids were transformed into E. coli (DH5α) competent cells and screened for positive colonies. Plasmids were \nextracted using the GF-1 Plasmid DNA Extraction Kit (Vivantis, Malaysia). All sequencing reactions were per-\nformed on both strands using the sequencing service from Macrogen Inc., Seoul, Korea.\nDNA sequence analysis. Query DNA sequences were searched for homology using blast against the \nNCBI database for gene identification. Genomic DNA and cDNA sequences were aligned using the ClustalX2 \n program\n66 and Unipro UGENE Version 1.14.067. For sequence analysis of Bdfru, the genomic scaffold (GenBank \nAcc. No. NW_011876307) was used to predict the gene structure. GenBank accession numbers of the references \nand the newly isolated sequences are in Supplementary Table S3.\nMorphological development of early embryos. The morphology of live embryos was observed during \nearly development (0 to 9 h AEL) under differential interference contrast using an inverted confocal laser scan-\nning microscope (Olympus FV1000). The collection of developing embryos, at each time point, was as previ-\nously described. The live embryos were gently dechorionated using 3% sodium hypochlorite solution for 5 min \nand then transferred in a drop of 1X phosphate buffer saline to a glass slide before observation and photography.\n11\nVol.:(0123456789)Scientific Reports |        (2020) 10:17938  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-74856-6\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nEthics statement.
