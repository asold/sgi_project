  "abstract": "In order to accurately diagnose the fault type of power transformer, this paper proposes a transformer fault diagnosis method based on the combination of time-shift multiscale bubble entropy (TSMBE) and stochastic configuration network (SCN). Firstly, bubble entropy is introduced to overcome the shortcomings of traditional entropy models that rely too heavily on hyperparameters. Secondly, on the basis of bubble entropy, a tool for measuring signal complexity, TSMBE, is proposed. Then, the TSMBE of the transformer vibration signal is extracted as a fault feature. Finally, the fault feature is inputted into the stochastic configuration network model to achieve an accurate identification of different transformer state signals. The proposed method was applied to real power transformer fault cases, and the research results showed that TSMBE-SCN achieved 99.01%, 99.1%, 99.11%, 99.11%, 99.14% and 99.02% of the diagnostic rates under different folding numbers, respectively, compared with conventional diagnostic models MBE-SCN, TSMSE-SCN, MSE-SCN, TSMDE-SCN and MDE-SCN. This comparison shows that TSMBE-SCN has a strong competitive advantage, which verifies that the proposed method has a good diagnostic effect. This study provides a new method for power transformer fault diagnosis, which has good reference value.",
