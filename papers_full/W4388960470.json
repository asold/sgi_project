GLMs in service currently cover \ngeneral knowledge but lack knowledge of specialized domains. 11,12 This means that the model may \nhave difficulty answering specialized questions accurately.11,12 Additionally, these models often fail to \nprovide complete and accurate answers to users' questions. 13,14 There is a representative problem \ncalled 'hallucination', which refers to a phenomenon in which the model generates information that is \nnot in the training data or provides incorrect information. 15,16 These issues reduce model reliability \nand can provide incorrect information to users.15,16 \nTo solve these problems, there is a need for GLMs tuned to specialized domains. Especially in the \nmedical field, since accurate and reliable information is important, the need for GLMs that include \nmedical information is becoming more and more prominent. 4,12,17,18 These models should be able to \nprovide medical knowledge to people other than medical experts. 4,19 These models can also play an \nimportant role in efficiently supporting the training of healthcare professionals. 4,20,21 In particular, it \ncan help students in medical professions understand complex medical terms, basis for medical \n .

Therefore, this study compared the answers \ngenerated when questions related to the specialized musculoskeletal domain of physical therapy were \napplied to fine-tuned and untuned models, respectively, to evaluate and confirm the possibility of \nwhether language models fine-tuned to the professional domain can correctly answer professional \nknowledge. \n   \n .

For this study, books related to the diagnosis and treatment of musculoskeletal disorders in \nthe field of physical therapy were selected. First, the book ‘Functional Anatomy’, which is considered \nthe most basic area in diagnosing or treating musculoskeletal disorders, was selected. 23 And a book \ncalled ‘Kinesiology’, which describes the movement of the musculoskeletal system in the human body, \nwas selected.24 In addition, ‘Diagnosis and Treatment of Movement System Impairment Syndromes’, \n‘Muscle Imbalance’, and ‘Kinetic Control’ books, in which diagnostic theories using movement or \nmusculoskeletal systems were written in relation to musculoskeletal disorders, were selected.\n25–27 \nFinally, a book called \"Therapeutic Exercise,\" which describes exercise therapy, one of the options for \ntreating musculoskeletal disorders, was selected.\n28 Document text was extracted using the \nRecursiveCharacterTextSplitter, and large chapters of the document were divided into small units to \nincrease processing efficiency. The extracted text was embedded by \nHuggingFaceInstructorEmbedding. The embedded document was then converted into a database \nformat using Chroma to enable saving and retrieval.  \n \n \nFigure 1.

This model is specifically designed for interactive AI and \nquestion-answering scenarios. The Lama-2-13B model was loaded using the AutoGPTQForCausalLM \nlibrary, and the settings required for model fine-tuning were performed. TextStreamer, a component \nthat processes input text, was used to process text data effectively. This step was important in \npreparing and formatting the input text before feeding it to the model. The process of creating a \nresponse using the Lama-2-13B model by constructing the HuggingFacePipeline has been simplified. \nThis pipeline has been applied to generate consistent and contextually relevant responses by managing \nvarious aspects such as tokenization and decoding during the creation process. Finally, the \nRetrivingQA framework was used to develop a QA model with added search functionality. Through \nthis process, a Fine-tuned QA model was established, which is expected to provide more accurate and \ncontextual responses to various musculoskeletal disease diagnosis and treatment-related questions. \n \n  \n .

The questions created were entered into the \nbase and fine-tuned models, respectively. The questions created and entered according to the selected \nbooks were as shown in table 1. \nTable 1.

The base model often failed to understand or provide relevant information because the \nquestions were unclear or key terms were not recognized. In contrast, the fine-tuned model \nconsistently produced answers specific to the musculoskeletal context, demonstrating improved \nunderstanding of specialized topics. In particular, the fine-tuned model did not show any lack of \ninformation for any question and showed improved performance in processing musculoskeletal \ninquiries based on fine-tuned text content. Regarding the serratus anterior muscle, the base model \nprovided a general overview of its role in shoulder movement and stabilization. In contrast, the fine-\ntuned model provided a more detailed description, emphasizing specific movements during arm lifting \nand outcomes related to muscle paralysis. For the scapulo-humeral rhythm, the base model was \ninsufficient to provide information due to lack of context, but the fine-tuned model provided a \ncomprehensive definition, including details on the “set-up phase” and the constant rate of humerus \nand scapula movement during shoulder flexion. Regarding scapular downward rotation syndrome, the \nbase model was unfamiliar and additional information was requested. In contrast, the fine-tuned \nmodel not only defined the major movement disorders but also outlined the associated muscle \ndysfunction, symptoms, and available treatment options. In the case of upper crossed syndrome, the \nbase model acknowledged ignorance of the term and suggested that more context was needed. \nConversely, the fine-tuned model identified specific muscle tension and weakness patterns associated \nwith the syndrome, providing a detailed description. Regarding the kinetic medial rotation test, the \nbase model lacked information about the test and provided speculative guesses based on the phrases \nprovided. In contrast, the fine-tuned model describes the components of the test in more detail and \nexplains how the results contribute to assessing rotator cuff muscles. Regarding postoperative \nmanagement of the glenohumeral joint, the base model provides general postoperative management \nprinciples, emphasizing the need for individualized advice. On the other hand, fine-tuned models \nrepresent a more nuanced understanding, emphasizing the importance of early mobilization, exercise, \nand potentially surgical stabilization for specific cases. \n .

Questions and answers from models before and after fine-tuning \nQuestion Tell me about the action of serratus anterior muscle \nBase model \nThe serratus anterior muscle is a key player in shoulder movement and positioning. It is \na fan-shaped muscle located on the side of the ribcage, and it helps to rotate the scapula \n(shoulder blade) and move the arm forward and backward. The serratus anterior muscle \nalso helps to stabilize the shoulder joint and maintain proper alignment of the shoulder \nblades. \nFine-tuned model \nThe serratus anterior muscle produces upward  rotation of the scapula during arm \nelevation, which exceeds the downward rotation produced by the active middle deltoid \nand supraspinatus. The serratus anterior muscle also produces a subtle posterior tilting \nand external rotation torque to the upwardly rotating scapula. The secondary actions of \nthe serratus anterior muscle become evident when there is paralysis of the muscle, \nresulting in a downwardly rotated position of the scapula, along with slight anterior \ntilting and internal rotation. \nQuestion Tell me about the scapulo-humeral rhythm \nBase model \nBased on the provided context, I cannot provide information about the scapulo -humeral \nrhythm as there is no relevant information given. The term \"scapulo-humeral\" does not \nappear in the context provided, and therefore, I am unable to provide any information or \nanswer related to it. \nFine-tuned model \nThe scapulo-humeral rhythm refers to the synchronized movement of the scapula and \nhumerus during shoulder flexion. According to Inman and Saunders, there is a \"setting \nphase\" during the first 60 degrees of shoulder flexion and 30 degrees of abduction, \nwhere the movement of the scapula is highly variable. After the setting phase, the \nhumerus and scapula move in a constant ratio, with 2 degrees of glenohumeral motion \nfor every 1 degree of scapulothoracic motion, resulting in 120 degrees of glenohumeral \njoint motion and 60 degrees of scapular motion at the completion of shoulder flexion. \nHowever, more recent studies have reported some variability in the exact timing of that \nmotion. \nQuestion Tell me about the scapular downward rotation movement impairment syndrome \nBase model \nI don't know about a \"Scapular Downward Rotation movement impairment syndrome.\" \nBased on my training data, there is no widely recognized condition or syndrome with \nthis name. It is possible that you may be referring to a specific movement pattern or \ndysfunction, but without more information, I cannot provide further clarification. If you \nhave any additional details or context, I would be happy to help as best I can. \nFine-tuned model \nThe primary movement impairment in this syndrome is insufficient scapular upward \nrotation. Muscle impairments include dominance, shortness, or stiffness of the \ndownward rotator muscles such as rhomboids, levator scapulae, latissimus, pectoralis \nminor and major, and insufficient activity of the upward rotator muscles like serratus \nanterior and trapezius. This syndrome can cause symptoms such as pain, problems, and \nassociated diagnoses. Treatment options are available, including conﬁrming tests, \nmovement pattern impairments, and relative flexibility and stiffness impairments. \nQuestion Tell me about the upper crossed syndrome \nBase model \nI don't know about the \"upper crossed syndrome\". I'm not familiar with that term or \nconcept. It's possible it's a specific condition or injury, but without more information, I \ncan't provide any further insight or explanation. If you have any additional details or \ncontext, I may be able to help better. \nFine-tuned model \nThe upper c rossed syndrome is also known as the proximal or shoulder girdle crossed \nsyndrome. It is characterized by tightness of the upper trapezius and levator scapula on \nthe dorsal side, which crosses with tightness of the pectoralis major and minor. \nAdditionally, there is weakness of the deep cervical flexors ventrally, which crosses with \nweakness of the abdominal muscles. This syndrome is described as having a specific \npattern of muscle weakness and tightness that crosses between the dorsal and ventral \nsides of the body. \nQuestion Tell me about the kinetic medial rotation test \nBase model \nI don't know about a \"kinetic medial rotation test.\" Based on the phrase \"kinetic medial,\" \nI might guess that it has something to do with the movement or rotation of the knee \njoint, but without more information, I can't provide any specific details or information \n .

It is also known as KMR T. \nThe test involves evaluating the patient's ability to perform medial rotation movements \nwith their arm. Specifically, it assesses for downward rotation, elevation, and anterior \ntranslation of the glenohumeral joint. The results of this test can help determine the \nefficiency of the patient's low threshold recruitment of the rotator cuff muscles \nQuestion Tell me management for glenohumeral joint after surgery \nBase model \nI can provide information on post -surgical management for a Glenohumeral joint based \non current medical knowledge and research. However, please note that individualized \nadvice should always be sought from qualified healthcare professionals who have access \nto your specific medical history and current condition. \nAfter surgery to repair or replace the Glenohumeral joint (e.g., rotator cuff repair, \nshoulder replacement), the following general principles may apply: \n1. Immobilization: The arm is usually immobilized in a sling or brace for several weeks \nto allow the joint to heal properly. This helps prevent further injury, reduces pain, and \npromotes proper alignment during the healing process. \n2. Pain management: Your healthcare provider will likely prescribe medication to \nmanage any discomfort or pain you experience during the recovery period. It is essential \nto follow their instructions carefully and not exceed the recommended dosage. \n3. Physical therapy: Once the initial inflammation has subsided, physical therapy \nexercises are crucial to regaining strength, flexibility, and range of motion in the \naffected shoulder. A trained physical therapist will design a personalized program \ntailored to your needs and progress. \n4. Wound care: If you had an open procedure, your surgeon will provide guidelines for \nwound care and dressing changes to promote healing and minimize the risk of \ncomplications. \n5. Follow-up appointments: Schedule regular follow-up appointments with your surgeon \nto monitor your progress, address any concerns or issues, and adjust your treatment plan \nas needed. \n6. Lifestyle modifications: Depending on the severity of your condition and the type of \nsurgery performed, you may need to modify certain activities or behaviors to avoid \nexacerbating the injury or compromising the healing process. For example, you may \nneed to avoid heavy lifting, bending, or overhead movements for several months. \n7. Monitoring for complications: Y our healthcare team will keep a close eye on you for \npotential complications such as infection, nerve damage, or blood clots. Promptly report \nany unusual symptoms or redness to your healthcare provider. \n8. Gradual return to activities: As you recover, gradually resume normal activities, \nstarting with low-impact exercises like swimming or cycling. Avoid heavy lif \nFine-tuned model \nAfter surgery, postoperative management is crucial for optimal outcomes. The text \nhighlights the importance of early mobilization and exercises to prevent stiffness, \nstrengthen the muscles, and improve range of motion. Immobilization for too long can \nlead to contracture, loss of motion, and weakness. The text also suggests that young, \nactive patients who have sustained an acute, traumatic, anterior dislocation may benefit \nfrom surgical stabilization, as there is a high risk of recurrence after nonoperative \nmanagement. However, it does not provide specific information on the management \nafter surgery. \n \n  \n .

However, general information was provided on postoperative management \nof the glenohumeral joint. The fine-tuned model provided more detailed and specialized information \non specific terms and concepts. It may provide more contextual information, but there may be \ndifferences in the quality of the response. It was suggested that fine-tuned models tend to provide \nmore detailed and context-specific answers, especially in areas related to specific muscle activities, \nsyndromes, and tests. For serratus anterior, scapula-humeral rhythm, scapular inferior rotation \nsyndrome, superior crossed syndrome, and kinetic medial rotation test, fine-tuned model provided in-\ndepth insights, whereas base model often provided uninformed or speculative guesses. Overall, the \nfine-tuned model demonstrated superior performance, demonstrating its ability to provide more \ndetailed and contextual information across a variety of musculoskeletal topics compared to the base \nmodel, which provides general information. \nThese results were consistent with various studies showing that model tuning enables effective and \nexpert responses to questions by equipping models with specific knowledge of specialized \ndomains.\n6,11,14 Several studies have already attempted to fine-tune large-scale language models or \nbuild medical language models in the medical field. 19,29,30 Yang et al (2019) introduced a large-scale \nclinical language model called GatorTron, developed with more than 9 billion words of text, and the \ngenerative model using this language model led to the improvement of medical question answers. 29 \nAdditionally, Lu et al. (2022) introduced the ClinicalT5 model and said that this model can be applied \nto various tasks in the medical field because it can understand and process medical terminology, \ncontext, and special language structures.\n30 Nova (2023) suggested that using a GLM learned from text \ndata such as medical records or from medical personnel's voice data could simplify and provide \nmedical information that was difficult for patients to understand.19  \nDevelopment of a language model in a specific field such as the above or improvement of the \nmodel through fine-tuning is also used for education in that field. 8,11,21 Karabacak et al.

This is an \nimportant advancement that could provide a new dimension in expanding medical education and \nexpertise. This approach is expected to contain specific knowledge about the field and provide more \ndetailed information, allowing medical professionals and educators to provide learners more \neffectively with an in-depth understanding of specific topics. The expertise gained through fine-tuning \nthe model not only increases its applicability in clinical situations, but also provides learners with rich \nexperience of real-world situations in the field. This realistic training environment can improve the \npractical skills of healthcare professionals and increase the effectiveness of research-based training. \nAdditionally, the utilization of GLM can overcom e language barriers and improve the quality of \nglobal medical education. Able to understand and handle multiple languages and cultures, GLM can \nfoster international educational collaboration and improve information exchange between healthcare \nprofessionals.  \nHowever, several problems are being raised in content creation using AI and GLM. Among them \nare content quality, bias, and ethical and legal issues.\n21 In addition, it is required to develop guidelines \nand policies in evaluating the accuracy of AI-generated content. 20,21 To this end, it is said that \nreliability and reliability can be increased by sharing information on data and evaluation methods used \nin education. 21 Continuous research and academic cooperation are needed to realize the maximum \npotential of AI and GLM in medical education and to respond to potential risks and challenges at the \nsame time.\n21 It is said that through the cooperation of medical experts, these technologies will be \nintegrated in an effective and responsible way, leading to improved medical care between learning \nexperiences and patients.\n20,21  \nThere were some limitations to this study. First, it consists of books that focus on specific topics \n .

In addition, certain medical books may be biased in their diagnosis and treatment \ndepending on the specific medical approach in their diagnosis and treatment methods. Finally, if the \nmodel is updated only with information from medical books, it may not always reflect empirical \nknowledge or up-to-date medical information about diagnosis and treatment. \n  \n .

This \ndemonstrates the effectiveness of model tuning for a specific knowledge domain and suggests that \nmodel enhancement using textual data on the musculoskeletal system may help in medical education \nand expertise acquisition.
