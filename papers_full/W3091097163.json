Introduction\nIn present traction systems, the AC supply is fed to a\nstep down transformer operating at low frequency typically\n50/60 or 16.7 Hz. The secondary windings (typically three\nto four) feed a four quadrant voltage source converter oper-\nated in PWM mode to control power ﬂow to the traction drive\nthrough inverter. These Traction Transformers are bulky and\nsuﬀer from the problems of low e ﬃciency and poor power\ndensity as they are designed for space optimisation. PETs\n(Power Electronic Transformers) or SSTs (Solid State Trans-\nformers) are deﬁned as power electronic systems that con-\nverts power between two voltage levels with galvanic iso-\nlation between them by Medium Frequency Transformers\n(MFTs) with full controllability of intermediate voltages and\ninput current. As increase in frequency reduces the size and\nweight of the transformer the idea is pursued for traction ap-\nplications. This beneﬁts come at the expense of design com-\nplexity and cost. The PET conﬁgurations can be broadly clas-\nsiﬁed into two types [Fig. 1]:\n1. Direct: In this topology, the AC power received is con-\nverted to high frequency AC using cascaded connected ma-\ntrix converters which is then fed to MFTs whose output is\nrectiﬁed by AC /DC converters which feeds the DC link of\nthe inverter of traction drive.\n2.

The isolation is provided by the MFTs of\nDC/DC converters.\nThe direct type suﬀers from the problems of current control\nat zero current crossing and diﬃculty to obtain soft switching\noperation. Hence the direct type is more popular and is con-\nsidered the future of traction\n(1). Hence this paper focusses on\nthe design optimization of an indirect type PET. Extensive re-\nsearch\n(2)–(8) has been done to develop PET suitable for 16.7 Hz\nsystems. Leading industries like ABB, Alstom, Bombardier\nand Siemens have published their work which pertains to\n16.7 Hz systems. Not enough research is done for 50 /60 Hz\nsystems though. Some designs for 50 Hz traction systems\nconsider SiC IGBTs which entails an undesirable additional\ncost to the system. In most of the above works, the design\nis based on a pre-speciﬁed frequency and pre-selected con-\nﬁguration & modulation of secondary power stage (DC /DC)\nwhile PET design involves a large number of variables some\nof which exhibits dependency upon each other and each has a\nmarked eﬀect on the eﬃciency and power density of the sys-\ntem. Such detailed analysis may not be required for 16.7 Hz\nsystems as the frequency is low enough to realise beneﬁts on\nsubstitution with a PET alone but for 50/60 Hz systems, a de-\ntailed analysis of all design parameters is essential. This pa-\nper explores optimization in every aspect of design viz. con-\nﬁguration & modulation strategy of secondary power stage,\nconverter circuit parameters (L, C values), MFT core dimen-\nsion, winding selection, cooling system design, ﬁlter capaci-\ntor design etc. To simplify the design process, the volumetric\nc⃝2020 The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan. 674\nDesign Optimization of PET in Traction ApplicationsʢSandeep Kumar Chowdhury et al.ʣ\n(a) Conventional traction supply system (b) Indirect type PET Substitute system (c) Direct type PET Substitute system\nFig. 1. Reference LFT system and the substitute PET conﬁgurations\ncontribution from the supporting structures and insulating\ncreepage distances have not been considered. The e ﬃciency\nand power-density analysis is carried out over a range of fre-\nquencies to arrive at an optimal set of design variables re-\nsulting maximum power density and reasonably high e ﬃ-\nciency. To elucidate the design process, the reference consid-\nered in this paper is a 4.16 MW, 25 KV , 60 Hz transformer for\nShinkansen series-700 [Fig. 1(a)]. The analysis presented in\nthis paper is applicable to any PET design in general. Keep-\ning the cost in mind, the design is done with conventional Si\nbased devices.\nThe intermediate bus capacitors decouple the operation and\ncontrol of power stages and hence both can be designed sep-\narately. The design parameters of each power stage for opti-\nmization are:\n1. Primary stage-CHB:\nNumber of modules (N), switching frequency (f) and line re-\nactor (L).\n2. Secondary stage-DC/DC converter with isolation by\nMFT:\nThe conﬁgurations viz. DAB, SRC and modulation strate-\ngies for soft-switching. The design variables corresponding\nto each selection are the turns ratio of the MFT (n) and the\ntank circuit parameters viz. L-for DAB and L, C-for SRC.\nThe MFT design is carried out iteratively by varying the\ncore dimensions and winding parameters viz. number of\nstrands and strand’s AWG considering the integration of the\nleakage inductance into the tank circuit, provision of requisite\nisolation, eﬃcient utilisation of the window area and opera-\ntion within thermal limits. The design of DC /DC converter\nand the MFT is done over a wide frequency range to ﬁnd\nthe optimum value for highest power density and acceptable\nlosses. The dielectric losses in the capacitors and Gate drive\nlosses are neglected in comparison to device and core losses.\n2. Design of Primary Stage: Cascaded H-Bridge\nAC/DC Converter\nThe input CHB interfaces with the 25 KV catenary, pro-\nvides sharing of the voltage among the devices. An N mod-\nule CHB generates a (2N +1) level output voltage waveform\nwhich improves the harmonic performance and reduces the\nﬁltering requirement. The total DC link voltage, V\ndctot re-\nquired for a nominal modulation index (MI) of 0.95 is given\nby:\nVdctot =Vspk\nMI =25\n√\n2\n0.95 KV =37.21 KV ··········· (1)\nWhere Vspk is the peak catenary voltage. The number of mod-\nules, N is decided by the device’s blocking voltage,VB given\nby:\nN =\n[Vdctot\nu.VB\n]\n···································· (2)\nwhere u is the blocking voltage utilization factor belongs in\nthe range [0.5, 0.6] and [. ] represents greatest integer func-\ntion.\n1. Device with low V\nB requires higher N which increases the\neﬀective switching frequency by N times reducing the size of\nthe ﬁlter reactor. The switching loss per pulse will decrease\nbut the conduction loss will increase as large number of de-\nvices are in series. In addition the reliability concerns arises.\n2. Device with high V\nB requires low N, hence high frequency\nor bigger size ﬁlter will be required to limit line current rip-\nples. The switching losse per pulse is higher but the conduc-\ntion losses will decrease.\nConsidering the points above, the design is done with\n6.5 KV Si IGBTs to have low number of modules, limit con-\nduction losses and restrict the reliability issues.\nHence N =11 modules are required and each CHB cell\nwill be having average voltage, V\nc of 3.83 KV .\n2.1 Operation Principle of CHB The CHB performs\nthe following functions:\n(a) Shaping the input current, controlling the input power fac-\ntor to unity.\n(b) Maintaining voltage balance across the DC bus capaci-\ntors.\nThese objectives are met by a set of voltage and current\ncontrollers which generates the control voltage, V\nr which is\nmodulated by a modulator which follows a voltage balance\nstrategy to synthesize it from N CHB cells by generating ap-\npropriate switching functions for each cell. For unity power\nfactor operation, V\nr is given by (Neglecting resistive drop)\n[Fig. 2(b)]:\nVr =\n√\nV2\nspk +(Ispk .ω.L)2.sin(ω.t−φ); φ=tan−1\n(Ispk ω.L\nVspk\n)\n····················· (3)\nTo keep the switching losses low, hybrid modulation is de-\nployed in the design as it takes the advantage of both low\nfrequency (stepped modulation) and high frequency PWM\ntechniques\n(9).

The cell voltages are\nsampled at the fundamental frequency ( f\no =60 Hz) and the\ndigital controller determines the voltage region k and then\nsorts them in ascending /descending order based on the sign\nof current which determines the charge /discharge operation.\nThis ensures that the cells with lowest voltages are charged\nand cells with highest voltages are discharged to maintain the\nvoltage balance.

PWM Switching losses: In traction mode, switching\nlosses occurs in S\n3 during turn on and and oﬀand reverse re-\ncovery happens in D1 during turning on ofS 3. Assuming that\nthe switching energy dissipation is linearly dependent on the\ncollector current, the average switching loss over the mains\nhalf cycle can be calculated by:\nP\nsw,PWM =2.fs\nTac\n∑ N\nk=1 Δtk.\n(\nEon +Eoﬀ +Erec\n)\n.Vc.(Is)K\nVR.IR\n··················· (16)\nWhere Δtk =(tk −tk−1) Eon and Eoﬀ are turn-on and turn-oﬀ\nlosses at rated voltage of VR and rated current IR obtained\nfrom the device datasheet.\n3. Voltage balancing switching losses: This component of\nswitching loss is due to the change in operating mode with\nthe sampling frequency f\no (changing from 0 to 1 and vice\nversa). The value of fo chosen in design is the supply fre-\nquency i.e., 60 Hz ensuring low voltage balancing switching\nlosses. In region k, (k-1) cells operate in mode 1 and (N-k)\ncells operate in mode 0, so the number of transitions from\n0 to 1 must be equal to the transitions from 1 to 0.Thus the\nmaximum number of transitions is the minimum of (k-1) and\n(N-k).

The conduction losses remain constant\nbut the switching losses increases proportionately [Fig. 4(a)].\nHence the volume of heat-sink required to dissipate the de-\nvice’s losses increases. The reactor losses mainly include the\nohmic losses which decrease with the decrease in size with\nincrease in frequency. The volumetric power density reaches\nthe maxima of 5.03 KW /L at frequency of 3 kHz while the\nweight power density reaches its maxima of 3.23 KW/KG at\n4.1 kHz [Fig. 4(b)]. Since the weight actually aids adhesion\nin traction, the optimization criteria is maximization of vol-\numetric power density. Hence the parameters corresponding\nto 3 kHz are selected for the primary stage CHB. The cor-\nresponding reactor required is 23.96 mH. The e ﬃciency re-\nalised is 99.54% with a nominal weight of 1307 KG and vol-\nume of 822L. The component-wise weight and loss details\nare given in Tables 1 and 2 respectively.\n3.

The ﬁrst step\nin the design of secondary stage is the selection of converter\ntopology among DAB /SRC and the modulation strategy of\nthe full-bridges at both sides of the isolation. In (14), a com-\nparison of e ﬃciencies of four topologies for isolated bidi-\nrectional DC/DC converter is done for a speciﬁcation. The\ntopologies are Dual Active Bridge (DAB) and Series Res-\nonant Converter (SRC)-with and without a boost stage. In\nthis paper, DAB and SRC topologies have been investigated\nin detail without the boost stage as it will increase the de-\nvice count and also demand additional space which will be\nsigniﬁcant for an N module PET. The dual active bridge con-\nverter [Fig. 5(a)) utilizes the leakage inductance L as a buck\nor boost inductor to transfer power over a wide range in both\ndirections. Adding a capacitor in series to the leakage induc-\ntance leads to the series resonant converter [Fig. 5(c)] which\ncan also be operated with bi-directional power ﬂow within\na wide range of input and output voltages. The selection of\nthe topology is done on the basis of least device losses which\nis the sum of conduction and switching losses. The latter is\ncontrolled through optimum modulation strategy. The con-\nventional rectangular operation mode with 50% duty ratios\nof the primary and the secondary transformer voltages is not\nconsidered as the ZVS exists over a narrow region of phase\nshift of the voltages and the switching currents can not be\ncontrolled. The triangular and trapezoidal mode of modula-\ntion results in lower switching losses. However as the trian-\ngular current mode has a low power transfer capability, the\ntrapezoidal current mode of modulation [Fig. 5(b)] is con-\nsidered for the design of DAB. With this ZCS at primary\nand combined ZVS /ZCS is achieved in the secondary. The\ndevices suitable for both sides are 6.5 KV and 3.3 KV for a\nblocking voltage utilization of 58%. The current ratings are\n250 A and 400 A respectively.

There is an idle durationT\n3 =0.5T −(T1 +T2)\nat low power, when power transferred is zero. This is possi-\nble if the voltage across the resonant capacitor does not for-\nward biases the diode in either bridge when the current goes\nthrough zero in a half cycle. This serves as a design con-\nstraint which gives rise to lower number of valid designs. The\nresonant frequency,ω\nr is selected between 80–90% of the se-\nlected frequency.

For the considered design, the SRC de-\nlivers lower losses than the DAB for any frequency. Hence\nSRC conﬁguration in the clamped mode of modulation has\nbeen considered for secondary stage.\n3.2 Cooling System Design for Converter Power Mod-\nules As most of the device losses occur in the form of\nswitching losses, the devices which are switched su ﬀer the\nmajor portion of losses.

The methodology in gen-\neral can be applied to design a substitute PET for any low\nfrequency system. The loss and volumetric dominant com-\nponents shed important design considerations to make PET\nmore attractive. About 79.5% of the total losses are device\nlosses which demand high volume of the cooling heat-sinks\nor more sophisticated cooling methods like Direct Liquid\nCooling (DLC)/Double Surface Cooling (DSC) which adds\ncost to the system.

Hence the HF core loss computation\nequation is modiﬁed as:\nP\ncHF =Vc.ki.fg.\n∑\nj\n[⏐⏐⏐⏐⏐\n1\nΔTon\n⏐⏐⏐⏐⏐\nα−β+1\n.|(k +1)Vc −Vs|β\n(N.Ac)β\n+\n⏐⏐⏐\n⏐⏐⏐\n1\nΔToﬀ\n⏐⏐⏐\n⏐⏐⏐\nα−β+1\n.|(Vs −k.Vc|β\n(N.Ac)β\n⎤⎥⎥\n⎥\n⎥\n⎥\n⎦ ········ (A6)\nSandeep Kumar Chowdhury (Non-member) received B.E. from De-\npartment of Electrical Engg.
