  "abstract": "Abstract Background Rural health care providers face unique challenges such as limited specialist access and high patient volumes, making accurate diagnostic support tools essential. Large language models like GPT-3 have demonstrated potential in clinical decision support but remain understudied in pediatric differential diagnosis. Objective This study aims to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and reliability of a fine-tuned GPT-3 model compared to board-certified pediatricians in rural health care settings. Methods This multicenter retrospective cohort study analyzed 500 pediatric encounters (ages 0‐18 years; n=261, 52.2% female) from rural health care organizations in Central Louisiana between January 2020 and December 2021. The GPT-3 model (DaVinci version) was fine-tuned using the OpenAI application programming interface and trained on 350 encounters, with 150 reserved for testing. Five board-certified pediatricians (mean experience: 12, SD 5.8 years) provided reference standard diagnoses. Model performance was assessed using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and subgroup analyses. Results The GPT-3 model achieved an accuracy of 87.3% (131/150 cases), sensitivity of 85% (95% CI 82%‐88%), and specificity of 90% (95% CI 87%‐93%), comparable to pediatricians’ accuracy of 91.3% (137/150 cases; P =.47). Performance was consistent across age groups (0‐5 years: 54/62, 87%; 6‐12 years: 47/53, 89%; 13‐18 years: 30/35, 86%) and common complaints (fever: 36/39, 92%; abdominal pain: 20/23, 87%). For rare diagnoses (n=20), accuracy was slightly lower (16/20, 80%) but comparable to pediatricians (17/20, 85%; P =.62). Conclusions This study demonstrates that a fine-tuned GPT-3 model can provide diagnostic support comparable to pediatricians, particularly for common presentations, in rural health care. Further validation in diverse populations is necessary before clinical implementation.",
