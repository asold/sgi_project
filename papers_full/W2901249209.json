    "abstract": "The temperature distribution and deformation of the transformer windings cannot be measured in a distributed manner by the traditional method and failure location cannot be performed. To solve these problems, we present a transformer winding temperature and strain based on a distributed optical fibre sensing detection method. The design of the optical fibre winding composite model is developed and simulated winding temperature rise test and local deformation test distinguish between measuring the winding temperature and the strain curve. The test results show that the distributed optical fibre can transmit wire strain efficiently. Optical fibres, in the process of winding, have a certain pre-stress. Using the Brillouin–Raman joint measuring method, one can effectively extract the optical fibre temperature and strain information and measure the length of the winding direction of the temperature and strain distribution curve to a temperature measurement precision of ±2 °C and strain detection accuracy of ±50 με. The system can carry out local hot spot and deformation localisation, providing new ideas for the transformer winding state monitoring technology.",
