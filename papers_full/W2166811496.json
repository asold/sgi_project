    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This article presents the design of a wideband impedance transformer with out‐of‐band suppression characteristics. The out‐of‐band suppression characteristics are obtained by loading several transmission zeros at both the lower and upper stop‐bands. For experimental validation, a 50‐to‐25 Ω transformer has been implemented at a center frequency (f 0 ) of 2.6 GHz. The measured results were in good agreement with simulations, showing a return loss better than 20 dB over 0.92 GHz (2.1–3.02 GHz) and an out‐of‐band suppression better than 18 dB over DC to 1.42 and 3.8 to 6.65 GHz. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
