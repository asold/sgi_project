    "abstract": "This paper presents a fluid-thermal coupled analysis method to compute the temperature distribution in a 31.5 MVA/110 kV oil natural air natural (ONAN) three-phase three-limb transformer. The power losses of windings and core are measured by load-loss test and no-load test respectively. The convective heat transfer process, radiation and oil flow inside the transformer are investigated by finite volume method (FVM). In order to validate the feasibility and accuracy of the presented method, the temperature measuring system based on fiber Brag grating (FBG) sensor is constructed for the temperature rise test of the 31.5 MVA/110 kV ONAN transformer. The simulation results deduced from the proposed method agree well with experimental data. This model can be applied to optimizing design and load scheduling.",
