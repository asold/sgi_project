An adequate Ca intake\nis particularly important during childhood and adoles-\ncence to optimise peak bone mass and consequently is a\nreadily modiﬁable factor in reducing osteoporosis risk\n(4).\nHowever, intake studies suggest that while younger\nchildren appear to consume appropriate amounts of dairy\nfoods and are meeting the recommendations for Ca\nintake, older children and adolescents tend to consume\nless dairy foods than their younger counterparts and thus\nfail to meet recommended intakes of Ca\n(5–7).\nIn order to address shortfalls in Ca intake in a popu-\nlation, accurate assessment of Ca intake is required to\nidentify those with suboptimal intakes, thus enabling\npublic health strategies to be targeted appropriately.\nAs dairy foods are the principal source of Ca in the\nWestern diet, assessment of dairy intake can potentially\nprovide a reasonable estimate of Ca intake. For popula-\ntion-wide assessment of Ca intake, or dairy as a proxy for\nCa, a dietary intake tool that is short, reliable, relatively\nsimple and inexpensive to administer is ideal.\nFor a tool to be recommended for use it needs to be\nreliable and valid. Reliable tools produce consistent\nresults when performed under similar circumstances, e.g.\nat repeat administrations and/or when conducted by\ndifferent researchers\n(8).

The present paper is\nthe ﬁrst of two reviews with the overall aims to identify\npublished tools that estimate Ca and/or dairy intake in\nchildren, adolescents and adults and to assess the testing\nof tool properties in order to recommend a tool(s) for use.\nThe current paper focuses on tools developed for use\nwith children and adolescents.\nMethods\nA comprehensive search was completed to identify\nexisting tools to measure dairy and/or Ca intake. The\nsearch was conducted using the databases MEDLINE,\nScopus, Ovid, Informit and Web of Knowledge, with the\nkeywords ‘calcium’, ‘dairy’, ‘milk’, ‘diet’, ‘nutrition’ and\n‘food’, combined with ‘tool’, ‘questionnaire’, ‘FFQ’,\n‘measurement’, ‘assessment’, ‘evaluation’ and ‘analysis’.\nThe search was not limited by dates, but databases were\nsearched from their year of inception, the earliest being\n1948 in the case of MEDLINE. The search was limited to\nEnglish-language papers only. An identical search was\nconducted in Google Scholar to identify any relevant\ntools or papers in the grey literature. Additional articles\nwere identiﬁed by searching the reference lists of the\narticles found. No age criterion was applied.\nTwo authors (K.M., L.B.) sorted the articles for rele-\nvance and where disagreement arose a third author\n(M.M.) provided input. Where controversy remained,\nthe relevance of the article was discussed and a ﬁnal\ndecision made regarding inclusion. Articles that referred\nto the development of a new tool to measure dairy\nand/or Ca intake in Western populations and did or did\nnot test for validity or reliability were deemed relevant.\nArticles that (i) measured dairy and/or Ca intake in\nnon-Western countries (due to differences in the major\nfood sources of Ca), (ii) utilised existing tools but did\nnot test these for validity or reliability in the study\nsample, (iii) were not in English, (iv) utilised 24 h recalls,\nfood records or diet histories to measure dietary intake,\n(v) did not assess dairy or Ca intake or (vi) were\npublished abstracts only were considered to be irrelevant\nfor the purposes of the current review. From the initial\n121 articles seventy-three were excluded, leaving\nforty-eight relevant articles for examination. Of these\nforty-eight, eighteen were categorised as relevant for\nchildren/adolescents.\nTools described in the articles were classiﬁed as\n(i) dairy assessment tools that assess the quantity or fre-\nquency of dairy food intake or (ii) Ca assessment tools\nthat estimate absolute Ca intake or categorise intake into\nspeciﬁc levels, e.g. $800 mg Ca/d or ,800 mg Ca/d.\nSome tools assessed intake of dairy foods or dairy foods\nand other Ca-containing foods and quantiﬁed or classiﬁed\nCa intake and quantiﬁed dairy food intake in terms of\nquantity or frequency. These tools were considered to be\nboth Ca and dairy assessment tools.\nWhen assessing reliability and validity of tools a sample\nsize of at least 100 subjects was considered acceptable\n(10),\ntests of association (correlation coefﬁcients) were con-\nsidered weak statistical analysis, whereas tests that mea-\nsured agreement (Bland–Altman or kappa coefﬁcient,k)\nand/or sensitivity and speciﬁcity were considered to\nprovide strong systematic analysis\n(11). A mean difference\nof 100 mg (representing about 10 % of recommended\ndaily intake or one-third of a serving of dairy products)\nwas considered clinically signiﬁcant. Further, a valuek\n.0?5 was considered moderate agreement,k .0?7 good\nagreement and k .0?8 very good agreement\n(11).\nResults\nEighteen articles reporting on seventeen tools that had\nbeen used in those aged less than 18 years were identiﬁed\n(Table 1). For two tools there were two articles reporting\non each\n(12–15), and another article reported on two other\ntools(16). Only two of the tools assessed dairy intake, ten\nassessed Ca intake and ﬁve assessed both. Details of each\nof the tools are provided in Table 1. The tools were used\nin a range of population groups of differing age, gender\nand race and with the exception of the study by Taylor\net al.\n(17), all subjects could be considered relatively\nhealthy participants.\nTool characteristics\nAll tools used an FFQ, with varying response options\ncovering a variable period. Ten were quantitative allowing\nan estimate of milligrams of Ca, six were semi-quantitative\nand one was qualitative. The quantitative tools allowed\nvarying serving sizes, the semi-quantitative tools provided\na standard serving size and the qualitative tool asked for\nfrequency of consumption of each food only. In terms of\nfood coverage, ﬁve tools included dairy products and\nother foods that make an important contribution to Ca\nintake. Two tools included Ca-containing foods plus those\nfoods that may displace dairy or other high-Ca foods\n(18,19)\nand another included ‘dummy’ foods to mask the intent of\nthe tool\n(20). Three tools were designed to assess several\nnutrients and the food coverage reﬂected this(16,21,22).T h e\nremaining six tools were general FFQ that were developed\nand tested for their ability to assess dairy and/or Ca intake.\nVisual aids to assist participants to identify and quantify\nfoods were provided with ﬁve tools. Six tools took less\nthan 15 min to complete, indicating a level of user-\nfriendliness, and one tool took 30 min\n(23). Information\nregarding average completion times was not reported for\nten tools; however, estimates from similar tools indicated\nthat four of these could be completed in,15 min while\nthe remaining six tools would likely require longer than\nthis. Most tools required computer analysis or professional\n1746 A Magarey et al.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S1368980013003108 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTable 1 Summary of studies describing dairy and/or calcium assessment tools utilised in child/adolescent populations and their key features\nAuthor (year), country\nTool*; tool type; population\nage; time span assessed Food coverage Time required to complete Application\nHuybrechts et al.\n(2011)(14,15), Europe\nD:43; Q-FFQ; 2–10 years;\ntypical week of previous\nmonth\nTotal diet Unknown; likely ,15 min\nVereecken and Maes\n(2003)\n(22), Belgium\nD:15; SQ-FFQ; 11–14 years;\nusual intake\nCovers important food sources of Ca and\nﬁbre, and less healthy food items\ncommonly consumed by youth: fruits,\nvegetables, cereals, bread, milk, cheese,\nother milk products, crisps, chips, sweets,\nsoft drinks, alcoholic beverages\nUnknown; likely ,15 min Not Ca/D-speciﬁc.

A few tools were able to provide an immediate\nindication of daily Ca intake, through a computer-based\nFFQ which automatically calculates intake for the parti-\ncipant\n(19), or via manual calculation with or without\nreference to the recommended dietary intake(17,20), or via\na simple scoring system to grade adequacy of intake(24).\nTool properties\nAll tools had one or more properties tested. Only ten\npapers reported test–retest reliability and these were for\ntwo dairy tools, one dairy/Ca tool and seven Ca tools\n(Table 2). The statistical analyses varied with correlation\n(Pearson, Spearman or intra-class) being the most fre-\nquently used test and six studies reporting mean values\nfor each administration, with only Lanfer et al .\n(15) not\nreporting standard deviations or conductingt-test analysis.\nThree studies reportedk values(15,22,25) and two of these\nstudies also reported classiﬁcation agreement(22,25). The\ntools were mostly used in children aged 10 years and\nolder, with eight of the studies having a sample size over\n100 and the other two less than ﬁfty. The period between\nthe two administrations of the tool varied from a mini-\nmum of 1 h\n(20) to 1 year(26), with most being 1 to 4 weeks.\nRockett et al. reported reliability for only one dairy item\nfor which the correlation was modest (0?56)(26). The more\ncomprehensive results of the study by Veerecken and\nMaes assessing four dairy items in two age groups\ndemonstrated only moderate repeatability for most of the\nitems with the younger age group tending to perform\nbetter than the older group\n(22). Similarly, the ﬁve dairy\nitems in the Child Eating Habits Questionnaire assessed\nby Lanfer et al. also showed moderate repeatability\n(15).\nHuybrechts et al. reported a weightedk value of 0?60\nrepresenting only ‘good’ agreement for their tool but a\nhigh correlation (0?80), a non-signiﬁcant mean difference\nof only 24 mg, and 57 % correctly classiﬁed and no gross\nmisclassiﬁcation\n(25). Only two other studies(18,19) reported\ncorrelation values as high as Huybrechts et al .(25) and\nboth studies explored test–retest reliability by ethnicity\n(Asian, Hispanic, non-Hispanic White) and by various\nage groups. While correlation was highest for 14/15- to\n18-year-olds compared with 10/11- to 13/14-year-olds,\nthere were no clear ethnic group or gender differences.\nOne of these two studies\n(19) reported a statistically\nsigniﬁcant mean difference of approximately 200 mg\nCa between repeat administrations which is clinically\nunacceptable. Similarly, Harnack et al . demonstrated a\nclinically unacceptable and statistically signiﬁcant differ-\nence in mean Ca, on repeat administration of their tool, of\n,100 mg despite an acceptable intra-class correlation of\n0?66 to 0?79\n(27).\nTwo other studies (24,28) reported correlations (0 ?74,\n0?76) near that of Huybrechtset al.(25) and Yanget al.(24)\nalso reported a non-signiﬁcant mean difference on repeat\nadministrations. Lower correlations were reported by\nRockett et al.( 0?58), who also reported a signiﬁcant and\nunacceptable mean difference of 150 mg(26), and Marcotte\net al.( 0?49–0?67), who reapplied the tool in many cases\nonly 1 h after the ﬁrst administration, and hence the true\ncorrelation for a more appropriate repeat administration\nof at least 1 week remains unknown\n(20).\nFifteen studies reported relative validity, three provid-\ning data on dairy food intake using four tools (16,22,29)\nand fourteen reporting Ca intake using fourteen tools\n(Table 3). A range of reference methods were used across\nthe ﬁfteen papers. Three studies reported using a 7 d\nweighed food record\n(21,23,28) and ﬁve studies reported\nusing an estimated food record of 3 to 7 d(16,17,25,29), one\nof which was web-based(29). Three studies used a single\n24 h recall(12,13,20) and four(18,19,27,30) used multiple 24 h\nrecalls. Huybrechts et al . assessed validity v. urinary Ca\nexcretion(14).\nAn array of statistical tests were performed and included\ncorrelation, comparison of mean values, Bland–Altman\nplots, agreement usingk, cross-classiﬁcation, and assessment\nof sensitivity and speciﬁcity (Table 3).\nFour tools, reported in three papers, estimated various\ndairy products with both mean values and correlations\nfor the tool and reference method presented\n(16,22,29).\nWith the exception of the seventy-ﬁve-item Block Kids’\nFood Questionnaire reported by Marshall et al ., all\nstudies showed signiﬁcant differences for milk intake\nbetween the test and reference tool. Similarly there were\nsigniﬁcant differences for most other dairy products.\nWhile correlations for milk questions were good to high,\nthey were poor for other dairy foods. Values ofk and\ncross-classiﬁcation results generally supported the poor\nperformance of the tools.\nAll studies using tools to estimate Ca intake reported\nresults of a correlation test between the estimate for the\ntool and the reference method. Few results were greater\nthan 0?5, suggesting moderate association at best. Thus\na discussion of the values reported for correlation\ncoefﬁcients (Pearson, Spearman, intra-class) will not be\nprovided in the present review as the meaningfulness of\nthese analyses is questionable. However, the values are\nreported in Table 3 to allow the reader to consider these\nalongside other ﬁndings.\nAll studies also reported mean Ca intake estimated by\nthe tool and the reference method. Eight papers reporting\non seven tools showed signiﬁcant differences in the overall\nsample or in subgroups\n(12,13,18,23,25,27–29).I na d d i t i o n ,\nMarshall et al . reported signiﬁcant mean differences\nfor the twenty-two-item targeted nutrient questionnaire\nbut not for the seventy-ﬁve-item Block Kids’ Food\nQuestionnaire\n(16). Four other authors found no statisti-\ncally signiﬁcant differences in comparison with the\nreference method\n(17,20,21,30). For these studies the mean\ndifferences ranged from values that would not be con-\nsidered clinically meaningful,,10 mg(16) and ,20 mg(21),\nto values that are approaching concern: ,66 mg(30),\nTools to measure calcium and/or dairy intake in children 1749\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S1368980013003108 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTable 2 Details of reliability testing of tools that assess calcium and/or dairy intake in children and adolescents\nStatistical tests\nAuthor (year), country Tool* Population\nPeriod between\nadministrations Paired t test\nCorrelation: Pearson, transformed\nPearson, Spearman, intra-class\ncorrelation Cross-classiﬁcation, k\nVereecken and Maes\n(2003)\n(22), Belgium\nD:15 n 207, 11–12 years;\nn 560, 13–14 years\n11–12 years: 7–15 d S: 4 dairy items CC: 11–12 years, 4 dairy items:\n39–68 % agreement, 74–88 %\nsame/adjacent\n13–14 years: 6–10 d 11–12 years: r 50?59–0?82\nCC: 13–14 years, 3 dairy items:\n37–62 % agreement, 70–80 %\nsame/adjacent\n13–14 years: r 50?57–0?71\nk: 11–12 years, 4 dairy items:\n0?44–0?70; 13–14 years, 3 dairy\nitems: 0?59–0?61\nLanfer et al.

While noP value was pro-\nvided, the mean difference reported by Wonget al. was\n127 mg(19).\nOnly three studies reported sensitivity and speciﬁcity\nanalysis(12,13,25) (Table 3). Sensitivity values ranged from\n62 %(25) to 82?8% (13) and speciﬁcity values ranged from\n54?9% (13) to 77 %(25). A similar concept to sensitivity\nand speciﬁcity is the calculation of cross-classiﬁcation\nstatistics, a model applied by far more studies\n(n 8)\n(12,13,16–18,23,25,28). While one study(23) did achieve\nlevels of correct classiﬁcation similar to those that reported\nsensitivity and speciﬁcity\n(12,13,25), none of these additional\nstudies achieved a smaller level of gross misclassiﬁcation\nthan those studies (5–26 %v.1 – 2?6% ) .\nSix studies used Bland–Altman plots to illustrate the\nlevel of agreement(12,13,20,23,25,29). The plots identify the\nmean bias and limits of agreement between methods and\nidentify whether a tool is valid for assessment of Ca intake\nat the individual and population levels\n(31). The mean bias\nbetween the tool and reference method ranged from\n,50 mg\n(29) to 250 mg(20,23). The difference between the\nlower and upper limit of agreement varied widely\nbetween studies but all were greater than 900 mg, indi-\ncating that none of the tools evaluated would be suitable\nfor use at an individual level.\nDiscussion\nThe current review identiﬁed eighteen papers that reported\non two tools that assessed dairy intake, ten that assessed Ca\nintake and ﬁve that assessed both dairy and Ca. Overall\nassessment of tool properties indicated a general lack of\nevidence to support use of any of the tools. The most\ncommon limitation of the testing of tool properties was the\nhigh reliance on correlation, which assesses association but\nnot agreement. Ideally, validity is assessed using a measure\nof agreement such as Bland–Altman analysis\n(8) and a\nmeasure of sensitivity and speciﬁcity (the ability of a test to\ncorrectly identify true positives and true negatives as in the\ncase of identifying adequate intake).\nIn addition, when assessing validity it is important to\ndetermine a clinically meaningful level of signiﬁcance as\nopposed to statistical signiﬁcance. None of the papers\ndeﬁned a level of clinical signiﬁcance at which the results\nwere meaningful in terms of dietary adequacy. This lack of\nrecognition between statistically and clinically signiﬁcant\nresults limits conclusions relevant to clinical practice. We\napplied a 100 mg Ca cut-off when assessing studies.\nTests of reliability were reported for ten tools only and\nof these only four studies reported mean difference for\nthe repeat administration (a ﬁfth reported the P value\nonly) and only two reported cross-classiﬁcation. Based on\nthese results and the overall lack of tests, only one tool\nassessing Ca\n(25) and one tool assessing dairy(22) could be\nconsidered reliable.\nTable 3Continued\nStatistical tests\nAuthor (year), country\nTool*; reference tool;\npopulation\nCorrelation: Pearson or\nSpearman\nPaired t test or Mann–Whitney U\ntest or Wilcoxon signed-rank test\nCross-classiﬁcation or intra-class\ncorrelation\nSensitivity/speciﬁcity or\nBland–Altman or k\nZemel et al.

With respect to tools that assess Ca, validity\nresults vary such that some should be considered with\ncaution while others appear to have acceptable levels of\nagreement and/or sensitivity and speciﬁcity indicating\nadequate validity. The tools that appear to be best in\nlevels of validity are those developed by Huybrechts\net al.\n(25), Vereeckenet al.(29) and Magkoset al.(12). Each of\nthese studies included a minimum of 216 children and\nreported less than 100 mg difference between the test tool\nand the reference method. It is important to note that the\ntwo Belgian studies were tested in children aged,2t o\n7 years\n(25,29), while a more suitable tool for older children\nmight be the tool reported by Magkoset al. as it has been\ntested in children aged 10 to 15 years(12). Importantly,\nonly one of these tools was tested for reliability(25).\nIn addition to the results of testing of tool properties it\nis important to consider the quality of the study design\nused in providing these ﬁndings. Key study design criteria\ninclude level of evidence, potential sources of error and\nbias, and sample size. All studies had level III-2 level of\nevidence, as deﬁned by the National Health and Medical\nResearch Council evidence hierarchy for diagnostic\naccuracy\n(32), i.e. there was a comparison with a reference\nstandard. They do not meet the criterion for higher\nevidence which requires an independent blinded com-\nparison with a valid reference standard, thus introducing\na risk of positive respondent bias.\nPossible sources of error in the methodology are\nlimitations associated with the reference methods used\nfor comparison with the identiﬁed tools. As there is no\nbiomarker for Ca status, only relative validity can be\nassessed, i.e. against another method, and thus there will\nbe some inherent limitations. Sample size is important for\nreliability and validation studies with a sample size of 100\nsuggested as the minimum\n(10). Most studies, and those\npotentially recommended, met this criterion.\nPotential positive respondent bias was present across\nall of the studies as none were blinded; thus participants\nwere aware of the study purpose and may have altered\ntheir responses with the aim of conforming to the\nrecommendations regarding Ca or dairy intake, resulting\nin over-reporting of intake. Potential recall bias is always\nassociated with an FFQ and the degree will depend on\nthe cognitive ability of the subjects and the period to\nwhich the FFQ refers (e.g. the last week, the last year).\nWith the exception of one study, samples appeared\nrepresentative of the population indicating absence of\nrecruitment bias.\nThe ability for a tool to detect change is an additional\nattribute and some argue this should be a third essential\nproperty of a tool\n(33). Sensitivity to change describes a\ntool’s ability to measure any degree of change and\nresponsiveness describes a tool’s ability to measure\nclinically important change. These parameters can be\nmeasured in a number of ways. The most frequently\nused measure is Cohen’s effect size: the ratio of the mean\ndifference (of the two measures) to the standard deviation\nat baseline. Whether or not a statistically signiﬁcant\nchange is detected depends on the sample size. However,\nif the sample is large a small change will be signiﬁcant\nalthough such a change may not be clinically signiﬁcant.\nImportantly, it is not appropriate to measure change within\nsubjects if the reliability of the tool is less than 0?5\n(33).\nNone of the tools described/recommended speciﬁcally\nreported the tool’s ability to detect change.\nBased on the review of methods and results of the\nreliability and validity testing of identiﬁed tools, there is\nno recommended tool for assessing dairy intake in child-\nren but three for assessing Ca intake. Appropriate testing\nmethods for validity and demonstrated adequate levels of\nsensitivity, speciﬁcity and/or agreement were reported for\nall these tools but only one was tested for reliability,\nwhich was shown to be moderate\n(25). Interestingly, there\nwere few common elements between these tools with the\nnumber, type and scope of questions and the target group\nvarying. The tool by Magkos et al . was the shortest,\ncontaining thirty questions, assessing semi-quantitatively\nthe intake of principally Ca-containing foods only in the\nprevious 12 months and self-completed by children aged\n10–14 years\n(12). The tool by Huybrechtset al. was parent-\ncompleted for young children (2–6 years), contained\nforty-seven items most of which were high Ca-containing\nfoods, assessed semi-quantitatively for the previous\n12 months\n(25). The tool reported by Vereeckenet al. was\nalso parent-completed for very young children but had\nseventy-seven items assessing quantitatively total diet in the\nprevious 3 months\n(29). In conclusion, there is an obvious\nneed for development and rigorous testing of tools to\nassess Ca and/or dairy intake in children and adolescents.\nAcknowledgements\nSources of funding: This review was supported by Dairy\nAustralia Inc.
