  "abstract": "Abstract In Hungary it is typical that 10/04 kV transformer stations are being installed in multistory residential and office buildings. Magnetic fields (MFs) up to several tens of µT have been measured in apartments close to transformers. The aim of the present study was to provide systematic assessment of MF exposure of residents living above transformer stations. Out of 41 addresses provided by the electricity supplier, current load of 21 transformers and MF in 21 apartments was measured. Spot MFs at 1 m height and time weighted average 24 h MF exposure at bed height was measured. All‐day personal MF exposure was measured at waist and HOME exposure was calculated. BED exposure was measured at bed height. Participants kept a time‐activity diary. The time‐weighted average 24 h MF exposure (3.03 µT) exceeded the usual residential exposure (&lt;0.2 µT). The mean HOME and BED personal exposure above transformers was 0.825 and 1.033 µT, respectively. Our study provides exposure assessment of a cohort with a wider exposure range, compared to power‐line epidemiological studies. Bioelectromagnetics. © 2006 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",
