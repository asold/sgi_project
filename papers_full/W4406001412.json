We used pattern-matching regular expressions to detect a possible signal \nin social histories and ran LLM four times on each social history to achieve self-consistency and then used logistic \nregression to estimate the impact of life events on the probability of having a code in health records related to \ncolorectal cancer screening.\nResults The LLM detected 380 patients with one or more stressful life events and 5,344 patients with no life events. \nThe events with the most negative impact on screening were arrest or incarceration (OR 0.26 95% CI 0.06–0.77), \nbecoming homeless (OR 0.18 95% CI 0.01–0.92), separation from spouse or partner (OR 0.32 95% CI 0.05–1.18), \ngetting married or starting to live with a partner (OR 0.60 95% CI 0.19–1.53). Death of somebody close to the patient \n(excluding their spouse) increased the chance of screening (OR 1.21 95% CI 0.71–2.05). Many of the observed effects \ndid not reach statistical significance.\nConclusion Our findings suggest that stressful life events might have a counterintuitive impact on screening, with \nsome events, such as bereavement, were associated with increased screening. Future work should be focused on \nvalidating the research findings using data from other health institutions. In addition, expanding the list of stressful \nlife events by including a validated scale of stressful life events for patients from historically marginalized groups is \nwarranted.\nUsing large language models for extracting \nstressful life events to assess their impact \non preventive colon cancer screening \nadherence\nDmitry Scherbakov1, Paul M. Heider1, Ramsey Wehbe1,3, Alexander V. Alekseyenko1, Leslie A. Lenert1 and Jihad \nS. Obeid1,2*\nPage 2 of 10\nScherbakov et al. BMC Public Health            (2025) 25:12 \nBackground\nColorectal cancer (CRC) is a significant public health \nconcern, with various social determinants playing a cru -\ncial role in its incidence, diagnosis, treatment, and out -\ncomes. Recent recognition of the increase in early onset \nCRC makes improving screening follow-through an \nimportant public health concern [ 1]. As with screening \nfor other diseases, adherence to CRC screening recom -\nmendations is crucial for early detection and prevention \nof the disease [ 2]. Research has shown that social and \ndemographic factors such as education, age, income, and \nhealthcare access influence the utilization of CRC screen-\ning tests [3].\nStressful life events, such as divorce, marriage, or sud -\nden loss of job, have a unique role as additional social \ndeterminants of health [ 4] as they span all aspects of life \nand may occur regardless of a patient’s social and eco -\nnomic status. However, populations with lower socioeco-\nnomic status are more vulnerable to adverse life events \n[5]. Negative stressful events in the social and family net -\nworks, such as the loss of a friend or family member, are \nsome of the most stressful and difficult for individuals to \nadapt to and have the highest impact on health and well-\nbeing [6].\nSocioeconomic stress-related neighborhood factors \nhave been shown to affect physiological stress and ele -\nvated allostatic load, which in turn impacts health dis -\nparities [ 7]. However, the impact of stressful life events \non adherence to cancer screening remains elusive. Davis \net al. show that patients with anxiety, a disorder related \nto life stressors, are 1.7 more likely to miss mammo -\ngram screenings [ 8]. Similarly, psychological distress has \nbeen found to negatively impact prostate cancer screen -\ning among U.S. military veterans, underscoring the role \nof psychological factors in preventive health behaviors \n[9]. On the other hand, some events considered stress -\nful, such as getting married or raising children [ 10], may \nform new social connections that alter health behaviors \nin a positive way [ 11]. Research on breast cancer adher -\nence shows that supportive social networks can encour -\nage cancer screening [ 12]. Thus, stressful life events, \nfrom the perspective of the health belief model [ 13], can \nact as both facilitators of screening (e.g., when they form \nnew social connections, such as in the case of marriage \nor childbirth) or as barriers (e.g., when they negatively \nimpact mental health or when social connections break \ndown).\nFurthermore, life events, such as getting married, have \ndifferential effects depending on a set of individual cir -\ncumstances and personality factors [ 14]. Marriage has \nbeen long considered a positive factor in well-being and \npreventive health behavior [15]. While the literature gen-\nerally supports the notion that marriage is associated \nwith improved well-being, research has shown that mari -\ntal satisfaction can vary between spouses, with husbands’ \nsatisfaction often being more dependent on the specific \ncontent of the relationship, while wives’ satisfaction is \ninfluenced by both the quality of the marriage and their \noverall well-being [16].\nThere is also significant variability in life events com -\nmonly perceived as negative or adverse. Research indi -\ncates that divorce or widowhood can lead to negative \nphysical health consequences, with these effects intensi -\nfying with age [ 17]. Other studies have shown, however, \nthat various individuals respond to divorce differently, \nand negative outcomes may not be pronounced for some \npeople [ 18]. Additionally, entering a new marriage post-\ndivorce has been associated with improvements in men -\ntal health [19].\nThe research on life events and health outcomes is \nimpeded by the lack of systematic representation in elec -\ntronic health records (EHR) [ 4]. Natural Language Pro -\ncessing (NLP) emerged as a valuable tool in healthcare \nfor extracting information from clinical notes. Clinical \nnotes contain unstructured data that can provide insights \ninto patients’ social history, including details on mood, \nmedication, lifestyle patterns, and social determinants of \nhealth [ 20–22]. By automating the extraction of clinical \nfeatures, NLP reduces the reliance on manual abstrac -\ntion, enhances the accuracy of data extraction, and \nenables the conversion of unstructured data into struc -\ntured formats for analysis [21, 23, 24].\nRecent advancements in large language models (LLMs), \nas a subdomain of NLP have shown promise in revolu -\ntionizing healthcare, with tasks ranging from analyzing \nbiomedical data [25] to extraction of social determinants \nof health [ 26, 27]. These technologies, such as ChatGPT, \noffer opportunities to analyze vast amounts of data effi -\nciently and identify patterns related to social determi -\nnants that influence health outcomes [ 26, 28]. LLMs \nprovide contextual understanding, temporal reasoning, \nand adaptability to complex free-text data compared to \nrigid pattern-matching or other approaches, such as bag-\nof-words [ 29–31]. By leveraging these tools, researchers \ncan better understand the complex interplay between \nsocial factors and health, leading to more targeted inter -\nventions and improved patient care.\nIn this project, we aimed to assess the impact of stress -\nful life events on CRC screening adherence using the \nlogistic regression model and LLM to extract stressful \nKeywords Colorectal cancer, Screening adherence, Stressful life events, Social determinants of health, Large \nLanguage models, Electronic health records, Natural language processing\nPage 3 of 10\nScherbakov et al. BMC Public Health            (2025) 25:12 \nevents from the social history sections of clinical notes \nfor patients at the Medical University of South Carolina \n(MUSC).\nMethods\nThe study is a retrospective chart review using longitu -\ndinal EHR data. For screened patients, the baseline time \nis the screening date minus 5 years. The 5-year period \nwas selected because events that happened prior to the \n5-year cut-off were considered not to have a substan -\ntial effect on screening decisions. For patients who were \nnever screened, the baseline time is the “expected screen-\ning date” (calculated as the time from their first visit \nplus the average time to screening from the first visit for \nscreened patients) minus 5 years. This process is further \ndescribed in the Description of the dataset used for analy-\nsis subsection.\nPatient phenotyping using EHR data\nWe extracted information from the EHR in Epic (Epic \nSystems Corporation, Verona WI) on all patients in the \nMUSC Health network aged 40 + and their respective \nclinical notes, diagnoses, and procedural data spanning \n2012 through 2022. Forty years was selected as a cut-off  \nage, following recommendations by the US Multi-Society \nTask Force, which recommends screening at age 45 years \nfor average-risk patients and screening at age 40 years in \npersons with a family history of CRC [32].\nTo ensure active patients in this sample, we subset \npatients who had:\n  • At least 2 codes (procedural or diagnostic) within 3 \nyears of each other.\n  • At least one clinical note with the social history \nsection (social history section was detected \nand extracted from clinical notes using regular \nexpressions, two examples of social history section \ncan be found in Supplement A).\nThe patients were marked as screened for CRC if they \nhad one of the following codes:\n  • General screening code (ICD-10-CM Z12.11).\n  • Colonoscopy (CPT 45378, CPT 45379, CPT 45380, \nCPT 45381, CPT 45385, CPT 1022231, HCPCS \nG0121, HCPCS G0120, HCPCS G0105).\n  • Sigmoidoscopy (CPT 1007635, HCPCS G0104).\n  • Occult blood test (CPT 82270, CPT 82274, CPT \n82272, HCPCS G0328).\n  • DNA test (CPT 81528, LOINC 77354-9).\n  • CRC-related surgeries (ICD-10-PCS codes \n0DBN8ZX, 0DBH8ZX, 0DBE8ZX, 0DBN4ZX, \n0DBH4ZX, 0D9E8ZX, 0DBH7ZX, 0DBE7ZX, \n0D9H3ZX, 0D9H4ZX).\nThis approach to phenotyping screened patients was \nadopted from the Centers for Disease Control and Pre -\nvention PLACES project categories [ 33], with a few \nadded surgical codes and the general screening code. In \naddition, we removed the time window consideration for \ncertain cases. For example, colonoscopy screening is con-\nsidered up to date if completed within 10 years. Keeping \nthis standard in mind along with the limitation that our \ndata spans a 10 year study period, we removed all tempo -\nral considerations and marked the patient as screened if \nthey had one of the codes listed above.\nPatient was excluded from the subsample if they had:\n  • Malignant neoplasm of colon (ICD-10-CM C18).\n  • Malignant neoplasm of sigmoid colon (ICD-10-CM \nC18.7).\n  • Malignant neoplasm of ascending colon (ICD-\n10-CM C18.2).\n  • Malignant neoplasm of descending colon (ICD-\n10-CM C18.6).\n  • Malignant neoplasm of transverse colon (ICD-\n10-CM C18.4).\nNotes processing and LLM inference\nSince annotating all social histories with LLM was not \nfeasible at our institution due to computational consider-\nations and time limitations, we initially applied pattern-\nmatching regular expressions to detect a possible signal \nin social histories. For example, notes containing words \nlike “evicted, ” “eviction, ” and “recently divorced” are likely \nto contain a stressful life event. A list of search terms \nwas created by using the list of stressful life events and \niteratively applying the whole script to the notes to avoid \nhaving a large number of false positives (for example, the \nterms “married” and “divorced” were excluded, because \nmany notes contained marital status, e.g. “Pt is married” , \nwhile we were looking for changes in marital status, such \nas “recently married”).\nOnly patients with notes containing these types of pos -\nsible signal were selected for further processing. A pat -\ntern-matching R script can be found in the supplement \nA.\nWe then created a few-shot learning LLM template for \nextracting stressful life events.\nfrom social histories in clinical notes with the Mixtral \n8 × 7B model [34]. This model provides high performance \ncompared to similar-sized alternative models, according \nto independent benchmarks, such as Hugging Face, and \nthis model quantized to 4 bits was the largest model that \nwas feasible to run on-premises with existing resources \nin a secure computing environment (since we had sensi -\ntive data in the notes that contains Personally Identifiable \nInformation, using cloud LLMs like OpenAI was not an \noption). The prompt included the range of stressful life \nPage 4 of 10\nScherbakov et al. BMC Public Health            (2025) 25:12 \nevents from the Holmes and Rahe scale [ 35]. This scale \nis one of the most widely used scales for assessing stress -\nful life events [6]; however, it lacks specific events impor -\ntant for historically marginalized groups. To mitigate this \nissue, we added some examples of these events identi -\nfied during our recent scoping review [ 4]. The LLM had \nto extract stressful life event and one of the three tem -\nporal aspects of the event: (1) the year when the event \nhappened, or (2) An indication that it happened recently, \nor (3) An indication that the year or recency of the event \ncould not be determined. We included a few stress -\nful events deemed positive (or at least positive for most \npeople), such as getting married or starting to date. The \nevents were presented in the prompt in random order. \nThis prompt was developed iteratively by testing on a \nsubset of 50 notes. The full prompt with few-shot exam -\nples can be found in Supplement B.\nWe ran the LLM inference 4 times on each social his -\ntory to achieve self-consistency. The value 4 was chosen \nto balance between accuracy and computation time on \nour hardware [ 36]. Each run is independent (doesn’t use \ninformation from prior runs) and may produce unique \nresults due to the indeterministic nature of LLM infer -\nence when a temperature parameter is set to a non-zero \nvalue (we used a value of 0.7) [ 37]. Thus, each additional \nrun ensures better confidence in the extracted events, as \nresults are aggregated: we assign the final result if it was \nconfirmed in at least 2 across all 4 runs. For example, in \nthe following 4 inferences of a single social history note, \nthe algorithm picks only the label “married” with a year \nof event 2021 since the date for “arrest” couldn’t be suc -\ncessfully determined in at least two runs:\n \nRun (1) Married (2021).\nRun (2) Arrest (2018), Married (2021).\nRun (3) No events detected.\nRun (4) Arrest (recent event).\nThe diagram depicting the steps of note processing and \ninference is presented in Supplement C. Figure 2.\nDescription of the dataset used for analysis\nThe resulting dataset was converted to a wide format \nwith the number of rows equal to the number of patients, \nbinary columns corresponding to stressful life events \ndetected in the notes, columns corresponding to time \nindication of when each event happened (could be one of \n4-digit year when the event happened, 4-digit year corre -\nsponding to the year of note for recent events, “no date”) \nand whether the corresponding patient was screened \npositive or negative, along with the screening date. If \nthe event happened more than 5 years before the date of \nscreening or if the event happened after the screening, it \nwas excluded from analysis as it was considered not to \nhave an impact on screening.\nSince we excluded events for screened patients (as \ndescribed above), we had to account for possible imbal -\nance for unscreened patients as they would have a lon -\nger tail of events than the screened patients would have. \nTo equalize the potential imbalance, we first calculated \nthe meantime interval for screened patients from their \nfirst visit to their screening. We then excluded events for \nunscreened patients that occurred after this mean time \ninterval and all events 5 years prior to their first visit.\nEach row in the dataset also contained demographic \ninformation like age, race, and gender. This dataset was \nused in a logistic regression model, which allows for easy \ninterpretation of odds ratios [ 38], where screened status \nwas a binary dependent variable (ever screened/never \nscreened), and binary variables (event occurred/event \nnot occurred) corresponding to the occurrence of each \ntype of stressful life event, along with age, race, and gen -\nder were independent variables.\nManual review of notes\nAll notes with stressful events detected by LLM and an \nadditional 50 notes with no events detected were manu -\nally reviewed to assess precision and recall of extraction \nand to ensure that only correct events are used in logis -\ntic regression analysis. The review was performed by a \nsingle human reviewer (DS) who was using a guideline \nvalidated by other team members to ensure consistent \nreview. The guideline was based on the prompt that the \nLLM used but included more examples. For instance, \nthe event “experienced abuse as a child or lived in prob -\nlematic household” was elaborated by providing specific \ncases (drug/alcohol usage in the household, violence \nbetween guardians, verbal abuse, sexual abuse, physical \nabuse).\nIn addition, the precision of extraction of date of event \nwas evaluated on a subset of 100 notes. Events affecting a \nsmall number of patients ( < 10) were excluded from the \npopulation table and odds ratio analysis.\nResults\nOf the initial sample of 777,962 patients, only 109,556 \nhad at least 2 visits more than 3 years apart and at least \none note with social history. These patients had 375,334 \nnotes with social history sections. After we applied pat -\ntern matching, 23,894 social histories were preselected \nfor LLM processing.\nAfter 4 applications of the LLM on each social history, \nwe deleted events outside of the screening interval. The \nmean time interval from the first visit to the screening \nwas 4 years. This time interval was used on unscreened \npatients to similarly exclude events beyond the aver -\nage time interval horizon to better balance screened \nand unscreened patients, as described in the Methods \nsection.\nPage 5 of 10\nScherbakov et al. BMC Public Health            (2025) 25:12 \nManual verification of the events reduced the total \nnumber of correctly extracted events to 701 (Table  1). \nPrecision of extraction of the event’s date (temporal fac -\ntor) was 87.7%. When considering unique events per \npatient, this rate translates to 380 patients with one or \nmore events and 5,344 patients with no events (Table 2).\nThe effect of stressful life events and selected demo -\ngraphic variables on cancer screening adherence was \nevaluated using a logistic regression model. The odds \nratios of being screened, sorted by the lowest p-value \nfirst are presented in Fig.  1. The regression table can be \nfound in Supplement D (Table 3). Being White or Cauca-\nsian race reduces the odds of screening (OR 0.64 95% CI \n0.57–0.73), along with belonging to other races (OR 0.76 \n95% CI 0.54–1.05). Age had a positive impact on screen -\ning with each additional year in age increasing the proba-\nbility of screening slightly (OR 1.01 95% CI 1-1.01). Males \nhad lower screening rates in our cohort (OR 0.82 95% CI \n0.73–0.91). The life events with the most negative impact \nwere arrest or incarceration (OR 0.26 95% CI 0.06–0.77), \nbecoming homeless (OR 0.18 95% CI 0.01–0.92), separa -\ntion from spouse or partner (OR 0.32 95% CI 0.05–1.18), \nmarried or starting to live with a partner (OR 0.6 95% CI \n0.19–1.53), although latter events had relatively low sta -\ntistical significance due to a small number of detected \nevents. Death of somebody close to the patient (exclud -\ning spouse) increased the chance of screening, although \nthe effect was not statistically significant (OR 1.21 95% \nCI 0.71–2.05). Other events, such as divorce, death of \nspouse, and critical illness did not appear to have effect \non screening adherence.\nDiscussion\nAdherence to cancer screening guidelines among cancer \nsurvivors is essential for early detection and improved \noutcomes [ 39]. In this project, we demonstrated that \nstressful life events may negatively impact adherence to \nscreening.\nWe were expecting that marriage, along with starting \nto date, would be correlated with screening theoretically \nthrough increased social support. For example, one study \nhas found that suggestion of a friend or a family mem -\nber was important in the decision to get screened [ 40]. \nHowever, in our sample, marriage also had a negative, \nTable 1 Precision of extraction and total number of correct events\n# Stressful life event Precision Recall Total \ncor-\nrect \nevents\n1 somebody close to the patient died, but not their spouse* 0.98 0.81 105\n2 was evicted from home or otherwise was forced out of their home 0.54 0.88 13\n3 immigration or displacement due to war, political upheaval or other adverse \ncircumstances\n0.00 - 0\n4 was fired from a job or was laid off 0.62 0.95 58\n5 got arrested or sent to jail 0.94 0.85 32\n6 got recently pregnant 0.26 0.97 42\n7 got recently divorced 0.90 0.89 58\n8 got recently separated from a spouse or long-term partner 0.96 0.85 24\n9 long-term relationship recently broke down (not divorce) 1.00 0.53 1\n10 became unemployed 0.88 0.73 35\n11 lost financial means to support themselves or was bankrupt 0.00 0.71 0\n12 was recently critically injured or diagnosed with life-threatening health \ncondition\n0.48 0.77 67\n13 experienced an event of discrimination based on sex, gender identity, race, \nsexual orientation or minority status\n- - 0\n14 was a victim of assault 1.00 0.33 1\n15 gone through suicidal attempt 1.00 0.91 2\n16 experienced abuse as a child or lived in problematic household - 0.83 0\n17 spouse died 0.96 0.78 166\n18 became homeless 0.65 0.63 23\n19 got recently married or started living with partner 0.43 0.79 73\n20 started dating a boyfriend or girlfriend 1.00 0.75 1\n21 gender transition or gender dysphoria - 1.00 0\n22 no events in the note 0.89** 0.19 11,825\n* The precision of the event was measured by assuming spouse is an official spouse as posed in the LLM prompt, but for the analysis of odds ratios, we considered, \nin addition, partners and ex-spouses as spouses\n** Based on 50 randomly selected notes\nPage 6 of 10\nScherbakov et al.

That may \nbe explained by the fact that our data included an older \ncohort. Hobson et al. have observed that marriage is get -\nting more stressful for older adults [6].\nIn line with other studies, we have found that incar -\nceration is a significant barrier to CRC screening [ 41]. In \nour study, we were able to show that not only currently \ndetained but also patients with a history of incarceration \nhad, indeed, much lower screening rates. This prompts \nfor targeted interventions for this vulnerable population.\nLosing access to financial resources due to unexpected \njob loss or becoming homeless expectedly reduced the \nchances of screening. Indeed, studies show that neigh -\nborhoods with lower socioeconomic status have lower \nscreening rates [42]. Unfortunately, many providers often \ndo not have any knowledge of whether the patient they \nsee is suffering from any such economic hardships. The \nevent of becoming unemployed, which demonstrated a \npositive impact on screening, suggests that a consider -\nable share of these events is related to retirement. This \ncan explain the increased screening rates, as older pop -\nulations typically have better insurance coverage and \ngenerally more free time to take care of their health needs \n[43]. When considering age as a demographic factor, we \nhave found that it increases the odds of being screened, \nechoing other studies that show that adherence to CRC \nscreening increases with age [44].\nIn terms of bereavement and stress related to death of \nfamily members, spouses, and friends, we had two ini -\ntial hypotheses. One suggested that stress from these \nevents would reduce the incentives to screening, while \nthe other suggested that witnessing somebody’s death \ncould incline a person to take care of their health in the \nface of the risk of possible mortality. For example, death \nof a family member from cancer could signal to a patient \nthat they might have an increased risk. Our study seems \nto differentially confirm both hypotheses. Death of a \nspouse seemed to have a detrimental effect (although \nthis effect was low), while death of other close people and \npets had a positive impact (with slightly higher statistical \nsignificance).\nMarital separation had a significant negative impact on \nadherence to cancer screening, in line with other stud -\nies that showed that marital dissolution leads to worse \nFig. 1 Odds ratios of being screened.

BMC Public Health            (2025) 25:12 \nhealth outcomes [17]. However, the effect of divorce was \nnot pronounced in our sample.\nRegarding demographics, we have found that Black/\nAfrican American patients in the MUSC network have \ngreater odds of screening. A similar effect was observed \nfor mammogram screening adherence in the same \narea [ 8]. The MUSC network might not be representa -\ntive of the general population, but the same finding was \nreported by at least one more study in Pennsylvania [ 42]. \nAt the same time, this comes at odds with nationwide \nresearch that shows racial and ethnic minorities, includ -\ning African Americans, are less likely to receive CRC \nscreening compared to non-Hispanic Whites [ 45]. One \nmore study indicated that there are variations in adher -\nence to screening tests based on race and ethnicity, with \nwhite participants showing a preference for colonoscopy, \nwhile non-white participants tend to prefer fecal testing \n[46]. This preference difference highlights the importance \nof considering cultural factors and individual preferences \nwhen promoting screening adherence among diverse \npopulations.\nWomen had higher adherence to cancer screening in \nour population. Ritvo et al. [ 47] highlighted that women \nshowed a higher rate of participation in CRC screening \ncompared to men in several studies, although factors \nsuch as the type of screening test, participant risk group, \nand age could influence this trend. Moreover, higher edu-\ncational attainment is associated with increased adher -\nence to cervical and CRC screening [ 39], suggesting that \neducational level may play a role in screening compliance \namong women.\nFuture work should include an expanded list of stress -\nful life events by including a validated scale of stressful \nlife events for patients from historically marginalized \ngroups. Current EHR systems typically lack features for \nsystematic representation and screening for stressful life \nevents [48]; however, we anticipate that standards-setting \ninitiatives such as United States Core Data for Interoper -\nability (USCDI) and the Gravity Project initiative [ 49, 50] \nmay address these gaps. Studies have shown that inter -\nventions, such as patient navigation aimed at increas -\ning adherence to CRC screening, can be effective [ 51]. \nA more systematic and structured assessment of stress -\nful life events may increase the range of interventions for \npeople following stressful life events.\nAt the same time, it is worth noting that no list of \nstressful life events is complete. Furthermore, stressors \nare subjective and have a large interindividual variabil -\nity. Future work can explore how some factors can act as \nprotectors against stressful life events, which in turn can \npromote cancer screening adherence.\nLimitations\nWe would like to note several important limitations. \nFirst, we had only a small span of data available cover -\ning 10 years, with most patients having a shorter span \nof data. That implies that some patients who we marked \nas non-screened were actually screened, but we did not \nhave data indicating who these patients were. Second, we \nonly extracted the year of the event, not the precise date, \nand the year for “recent” events was replaced with the \nyear current to the note. The effects of our analysis might \nbe influenced by this factor. However, we think that our \napproach is still valid in determining the direction of \nimpact and magnitude of life events.\nWe also omitted some stressful life events found in \nHolmes and Rahe scale by focusing on events with the \nhighest mean score of impact (M > 40), only adding a \nhandful of other events with a lower impact score, such \nas death of a close friend or losing financial support. \nHolmes and Rahe scale lists this latter event as “Major \nchange in financial state, ” which can also include financial \ngains, which we did not consider in our study. However, \nwe think that concentrating on the most impactful events \nis justifiable to make an LLM-based extraction more \naccurate.\nBecause analyzed events are rare and underreported \nin health records, it was not feasible to perform an ini -\ntial power analysis. For this reason, we decided to use \nall the notes available to us. While we agree that we \nprobably missed some of the events, especially since we \ntook the pragmatic approach to reduce computational \nrequirements for LLMs by using regular expressions to \npre-screen the notes prior to LLM inference, we estimate \nrecall (Table  1) and show that the recall was relatively \nhigh for most events in the analysis.\nIn our study, we used EHR data from only one institu -\ntion, and some statistical associations were weak because \nof a small number of detected events; thus, further work \nis needed to validate these models at other institutions \nand, preferably, other regions of the country. Our analysis \ndid not include important covariates, such as socioeco -\nnomic status. It is well known that resources can buffer \nthe negative effects of stress [ 52]. This information is not \nroutinely collected during the patient admission process \nand is usually not reflected in free-text notes, perhaps a \nproxy variable for socioeconomic status could be the type \nof insurance used or social vulnerability based on geo -\ncoded addresses.\nConclusion\nAdherence to CRC screening recommendations is crucial \nfor early detection and prevention of the disease. Stress -\nful life events, as a unique and often invisible category in \nsocial determinants, play a significant role in screening \nadherence.
