  "abstract": "Background Large language model (LLM) artificial intelligence (AI) tools have the potential to streamline health care administration by enhancing efficiency in document drafting, resource allocation, and communication tasks. Despite this potential, the adoption of such tools among hospital administrators remains understudied, particularly at the individual level. Objective This study aims to explore factors influencing the adoption and use of LLM AI tools among hospital administrators in China, focusing on enablers, barriers, and practical applications in daily administrative tasks. Methods A multicenter, cross-sectional, descriptive qualitative design was used. Data were collected through semistructured face-to-face interviews with 31 hospital administrators across 3 tertiary hospitals in Beijing, Shenzhen, and Chengdu from June 2024 to August 2024. The Colaizzi method was used for thematic analysis to identify patterns in participants’ experiences and perspectives. Results Adoption of LLM AI tools was generally low, with significant site-specific variations. Participants with higher technological familiarity and positive early experiences reported more frequent use, while barriers such as mistrust in tool accuracy, limited prompting skills, and insufficient training hindered broader adoption. Tools were primarily used for document drafting, with limited exploration of advanced functionalities. Participants strongly emphasized the need for structured training programs and institutional support to enhance usability and confidence. Conclusions Familiarity with technology, positive early experiences, and openness to innovation may facilitate adoption, while barriers such as limited knowledge, mistrust in tool accuracy, and insufficient prompting skills can hinder broader use. LLM AI tools are now primarily used for basic tasks such as document drafting, with limited application to more advanced functionalities due to a lack of training and confidence. Structured tutorials and institutional support are needed to enhance usability and integration. Targeted training programs, combined with organizational strategies to build trust and improve accessibility, could enhance adoption rates and broaden tool use. Future quantitative investigations should validate the adoption rate and influencing factors.",
