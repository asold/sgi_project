Its primary purpose is to function as a virtual assistant, facilitating rou -\ntine user activities [2]. Chatbots are categorized into two groups depending on how \nthey were developed: rule-based and machine learning (ML)-based, and they have \nenormous educational potential and favorably affect students’ learning and satis -\nfaction [3–5]. Chatbots that operate on a rule-based system are designed with pre -\ndetermined rules that dictate their responses to specific inquiries. However, their \nAseel O. Ajlouni1(), \nFatima Abd-Alkareem \nWahba2, Abdallah Salem \nAlmahaireh3\n1Arab Open University, \nAmman, Jordan\n2Middle East University, \nAmman, Jordan\n3The University of Jordan, \nAmman, Jordan\na.ajlouni@ju.edu.jo\nhttps://doi.org/10.3991/ijim.v17i18.41753\n 100 International Journal of Interactive Mobile Technologies (iJIM) iJIM | Vol. 17 No. 18 (2023)\nAjlouni et al.\nability to comprehend complex queries is restricted. In contrast, chatbots that utilize \nmachine learning (ML) are trained on vast datasets, enabling them to acquire knowl-\nedge and respond to various prompts [6]. An example of such an ML-based chatbot \nis ChatGPT, created by OpenAI and made available to the public in November 2022. \nIt is a primary linguistic model (LLM) developed using a sizable dataset [7–8].\nChatGPT has the ability to produce high-quality paragraphs and diverse research \npapers and effectively respond to examination inquiries; it is noteworthy that this par-\nticular aspect also contributes to the debugging process through its ability to predict, \nexplain, correct errors, and represent knowledge [9–12]. Interacting and conversing \nwith technology is widely regarded as a revolution and a new era [13]. The ChatGPT \nplatform was updated in March 2023 [14] and presented as a potentially valuable \neducational tool. Further investigation is warranted to explore and evaluate the poten-\ntial applications of ChatGPT across various academic disciplines, research endeavors, \nand practical settings. Recent literature has reported several studies investigating the \nadvantages of ChatGPT in various domains, including healthcare, mathematics, lan-\nguage, and medical education [14–17]. Moreover, additional research endeavors have \nsought to enumerate the benefits and drawbacks of particular disciplines, including \nthose within medicine [18]. Despite the well-established impact of attitudes on the \nacceptance, adoption, and intention to utilize technology [19–21], no empirical investi-\ngation has been conducted to examine students’ attitudes toward this novel technology.\nAccording to scholarly literature, attitude is a psychological construct encom -\npassing an individual’s emotional state directed towards goal-oriented behavior. \nIt is characterized by the desire to attain a specific outcome [22]. Numerous studies \nin educational technology have demonstrated that attitude is the primary determi -\nnant of the desire to incorporate technology in the educational process. Furthermore, \nthese studies have established a correlation between one’s attitudes towards tech -\nnology and one’s willingness to utilize or abstain from it [23]. Nonetheless, individ -\nuals’ comprehension and acceptance of technology may vary, as it can be perceived \nas ambiguous or menacing, consequently impacting their attitudes [24]. Hence, it \nis important to assess individuals attitudes towards recently developed technol -\nogies, as attitudes have an influence on their adoption [25]. Examining students’ \nattitudes towards using ChatGPT in the realm of education is crucial. Most recent \nstudies about ChatGPT in education have concentrated on emphasizing its potential, \nstrengths, and limitations in particular domains [26].\nAdditionally, the UNESCO-organized International Conference has advocated for \npromoting the equitable use of AI applications across all industries, particularly edu-\ncation [27]. Notwithstanding those mentioned above, no research has investigated \nstudents’ attitudes regarding the utilization of ChatGPT in education; this under -\nscores the significance of the present study, which endeavors to examine the attitudes \nof undergraduate students in Jordan toward using ChatGPT as an instrument for \nlearning. This study represents the initial investigation into a burgeoning research \nfield that can significantly influence students’ ability to adapt to and accept novel \ntechnological advancements. The ChatGPT platform exhibits promising potential in \neducation. The results of this study provide valuable insights for decision-makers in \nhigher education and instructors on how to improve the effectiveness of pedagogy \nthrough the integration of ChatGPT technology in educational settings. The present \nresearch endeavors to address the following inquiry clearly and deliberately:\nWhat is the attitude of undergraduate students at the University of Jordan regarding \nusing ChatGPT as a learning tool?\nThe following section provides an overview of the theoretical foundations and \ncurrent research on integrating ChatGPT in educational settings and attitudes toward \ntechnology-based learning tools. The following section provides a description of the \niJIM | Vol. 17 No. 18 (2023) International Journal of Interactive Mobile Technologies (iJIM) 101\nStudents’ Attitudes Towards Using ChatGPT as a Learning Tool: The Case of the University of Jordan\nstudy’s methodology before presenting and analyzing the findings. Finally, the study \nconcludes with recommendations for future research.\n2\t LITERATURE\tREVIEW\tAND\tTHEORETICAL\tFRAMEWORK\n2.1\t ChatGPT\nChatGPT is a cutting-edge innovation that was released to the public just last year; it \ndistinguishes itself as a powerful natural language processing tool thanks to its ability \nto comprehend and generate natural language indistinguishable from that of a human \nspeaker. Additionally, it can engage in extended dialogues by soliciting information on \ndiverse subjects and generating programming code and entries [28] [29]. The key feature \nthat sets it apart is its capacity to generate texts that closely resemble those produced by \nhumans, thereby simulating natural conversation [30]. Additionally, it can undertake \na range of functions, including aiding in interpersonal communication and facilitating \ntargeted information retrieval, thereby unlocking novel prospects for creativity, effi-\ncacy, and ingenuity [31] [32]. The ChatGPT platform has demonstrated its proficiency \nin various fields, including but not limited to education, healthcare, human-machine \ninteraction, and scientific research, as indicated by previous studies [33].\nThe GPT4 model represents the most recent iteration of an expanded language \nmodel, boasting an impressive 175 billion parameters. This model was trained on \na varied dataset of naturally occurring text sourced from various online outlets, \nincluding web pages, books, and scholarly articles [34]. The exploration of GPT-4’s \npotential in various fields, including biomedical engineering branches, has been \ndocumented [35]. According to [36], GPT-4 surpasses ChatGPT and GPT-3 in terms \nof performance. It successfully clears the Japanese medical licensing examinations. \nFurthermore, according to [37], the findings indicate that GPT-4 outperforms GPT-3.5, \nas evidenced by an additional 11 points achieved in the Exame Nacional do Ensino \nMédio (ENEM), which Brazilian universities widely utilize. Furthermore, as reported \nby [38], GPT-4 surpasses the minimum threshold for the United States Medical \nLicensing Examination (USMLE) and outperforms GPT-3.5 in this assessment.\n2.2\t ChatGPT\tin\tthe\tcontext\tof\teducation\nChatGPT presents significant opportunities in education by facilitating the com -\npletion of homework assignments, recommending scholarly articles, and enabling \nstudents to tackle intricate tasks by providing essential information and innovative \nproblem-solving techniques. This is achieved through the platform’s capacity to gen-\nerate human-like conversations [39] [40]. Within the realm of education, ChatGPT has \nthe potential to enhance various aspects of learning, such as writing and research skills, \npersonalized learning, learner autonomy, motivation, and engagement. Additionally, \nit may prove helpful in medical education and clinical decision-making [32] [41] [42].\nStudies conducted in education have exhibited a range of objectives and outcomes \nconcerning the utilization, benefits, and constraints of ChatGPT [11]. For example, \nSallam’s study [14] in healthcare education demonstrated that ChatGPT could facilitate \nscientific research, personalized learning, critical thinking, problem-based learning, \nand practice. The study by [43] highlighted the motivational ability of ChatGPT-\nbased instruction and posited ChatGPT as a viable educational resource. Several \nresearchers, however, have pointed out some of the difficulties that could arise while \nimplementing ChatGPT in classrooms. Copyright infringement, transparency, and \n 102 International Journal of Interactive Mobile Technologies (iJIM) iJIM | Vol. 17 No. 18 (2023)\nAjlouni et al.\nplagiarism are just a few examples of the ethical, legal, and privacy problems that \nfall under this umbrella. Additionally, as shown by several studies [14] [38] [44], there \nare some concerns regarding integrating ChatGPT in education, including confiden-\ntiality, originality, validity, the possibility of false rumors, cheating, and dishonest or \nmanipulative behavior that threaten the information’s reliability and security and \nproduce potentially hazardous or deceptive content. However, additional research \n[45] has suggested a set of strategies and procedures that may be used to guarantee \nthe correct and efficient application of ChatGPT in educational contexts. In conclu -\nsion, studies have been undertaken on using ChatGPT in the classroom to evaluate its \npotential as a pedagogical tool. Research into their utility has looked at the pros and \ncons. However, further study is urgently needed to examine the psychological impact \nof unfavorable settings on students, such as negative attitudes that may hinder their \nacceptance, adaptation, and intention to utilize ChatGPT in the learning process.\n2.3\t Student’s\tattitude\tin\tthe\tcontext\tof\tinnovative\tlearning\ttools\nAccording to the definition of attitude, it is a person’s “psychological state of pre-\nparedness” toward a person or subject. This attitude can result in either positive or \nnegative feelings, depending on how they have previously interacted with the person \nor issue [46]. According to the ABC model, attitude is a psychological construct encom-\npassing three components: affect, behavior, and cognition. “Affect” pertains to the emo-\ntional aspect of attitude, which refers to an individual’s feelings or reactions toward \na particular object or concept. The term “behavior” applies to an individual’s actions \nor conduct towards a particular object or situation, while “cognition” pertains to an \nindividual’s beliefs or perceptions regarding said object or situation [47–50].\nAttitudes are commonly shaped through direct exposure, emulation, incentiv -\nization, and social learning. According to research [51], students’ attitudes toward \ntechnology have an impact on their socio-emotional development. Attitude is a vari-\nable psychological structure rather than a static state. The examination of attitudes \nis deemed a significant determinant due to its impact on the adoption of technology, \nparticularly in the realm of education, and it has the potential to impede its efficacy \nas a pedagogical instrument [23]. Therefore, it is imperative to create an assessment \ntool that can examine students’ attitudes towards a novel technological resource that \nholds promise in the field of education, given the significant influence of attitude \non the adoption of technology. Consequently, the scholars developed sophisticated \nmeasures to evaluate the attitudes of both students and educators regarding innova-\ntive pedagogical instruments, i.e., attitudes toward computers, robots, chatbots, and \nartificial intelligence (AI) applications [52–56].\n2.4\t Previous\tstudies\nThe literature on attitudes towards ChatGPT in education is generally lacking; \nthere are two studies that have been conducted to examine public attitudes towards \nChatGPT and another one to investigate teachers’ attitudes, so we relate to the pre -\nvious studies that have investigated students’ attitudes towards chatbots and arti -\nficial intelligence, which also lack in the literature. The first example of the studies \nconducted in the field of public attitudes towards ChatGPT is the study of [57] that \nadopted natural language processing approaches utilizing sentiment analysis and \ntopic modeling methods to Twitter’s data. The study’s findings revealed that the over-\nall attitude is largely neutral to positive, where the number of positive tweets about \niJIM | Vol. 17 No. 18 (2023) International Journal of Interactive Mobile Technologies (iJIM) 103\nStudents’ Attitudes Towards Using ChatGPT as a Learning Tool: The Case of the University of Jordan\nChatGPT exceeds the number of negative tweets, although there is a higher count \nof tweets with neutral sentiments compared to both positive and negative ones. \nSimilarly, [58] conducted a study to recognize concerns and attitudes towards using \nChatGPT in education. The study utilized BERT-based sentiment and topic modeling \ntechniques, and the natural language processing tools were used to explore a total of \n247,484 tweets that were posted from December 1, 2022, to March 31, 2023. The sen-\ntiment analysis revealed that Twitter users have positive attitudes towards ChatGPT \nin education. While in Pakistan, [59] conducted qualitative research to investigate \nteachers’ attitudes towards using ChatGPT. The study utilized semi-structured inter-\nviews and comprised 20 faculty members from a private university. The findings \nrevealed that the faculty members had negative attitudes towards ChatGPT and had \nsome concerns, including cheating and plagiarism.\nPrevious studies that have investigated teachers’ or students’ attitudes towards AI \nor chatbots were a little varied in their results, populations, and methodologies. For \nexample, in German, [60] conducted a study to investigate medical students’ attitudes \ntowards using chatbots and AI in medicine. The study adopted mixed methods, uti -\nlizing standardized quantitative questionnaires and qualitative analysis of group dis-\ncussions. The study comprised 12 medical students, and the findings revealed that the \nbasic attitudes towards the utilization of AI were positive among students, as they had \nsome concerns regarding using it, including data protection. Furthermore, in Kenya, \nBii and his colleagues [61] conducted a study that aimed to investigate teachers’ atti-\ntudes towards utilizing chatbots in the teaching and learning processes. The study \nadopted a quasi-experimental design, and the sample comprised 10 teachers from a \npublic boy‘s boarding school and a public girl’s boarding school. The results revealed \nthat teachers have positive attitudes towards using chatbots in teaching. Similarly, \nShanqeeti [62] conducted a descriptive study in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) \nto investigate teachers’ attitudes towards using interactive chatbots in teaching stu -\ndents with special needs. The study sample comprised 150 teachers (103 male and \n48 female). The finding revealed that those teachers had a moderate degree of atti -\ntudes toward and use of interactive chatbots in teaching students with special needs, \nas well as a medium degree of challenges that they faced while using them.\nIn Jordan, [63] conducted a descriptive study to explore the attitudes towards AI  \nand machine learning among medical students. The data were collected using a vali-\ndated questionnaire from 900 medical students from six universities, and the descrip-\ntive analysis demonstrated that the majority of the students believed in the significance \nof AI in the field of medicine and the benefits of AI education in the medical career. \nAlso, [64] conducted a systematic review to explore healthcare students’ attitudes \ntowards AI. The study includes 38 studies from PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of \nScience databases. The result of the analysis revealed that the healthcare students had \npositive attitudes towards AI in the medicine field.\nBased on the above literature, there is a pressing need to investigate students’ atti-\ntudes towards utilizing ChatGPT in education. Therefore, this study aims to address \nthe gap in the literature regarding attitudes toward ChatGPT as a learning tool across \ndiverse academic disciplines.\n3\t METHODOLOGY\n3.1\t Design,\tparticipants,\tand\tprocedures\nThe research employed a quantitative research methodology utilizing a descrip -\ntive design to examine undergraduate students’ attitudes regarding using ChatGPT as \n 104 International Journal of Interactive Mobile Technologies (iJIM) iJIM | Vol. 17 No. 18 (2023)\nAjlouni et al.\na learning tool at the University of Jordan. The employment of descriptive quantita-\ntive design is a suitable method for exploring a variable within a specific population \nand obtaining data about it [65] [66]. The survey method using questionnaires is an \nappropriate method for a descriptive study, specifically when the researcher is con-\ncerned with attitudes, as indicated by previous research [65]. Therefore, a descrip -\ntive quantitative study was performed, and the data were collected via an online \nquestionnaire in May 2023, during the second academic semester of the 2022–2023 \nacademic years. The researcher adopted a random sampling technique to ensure \nthe unbiased selection of the sample [67]. Before the beginning of the study, the \nnecessary consent was obtained from both the institutional board at the University \nof Jordan and the participants involved. In addition, the distribution of a question -\nnaire hyperlink to 690 students was requested by utilizing various platforms, includ-\ning Microsoft Teams, email, and Moodle. The data was gathered over three weeks. \n623 questionnaires were returned, with a response rate of 90%.\nThe population of this research was 40188 students, which are all undergradu -\nates who enrolled at the University of Jordan during the second semester of the aca-\ndemic year 2022–2023. The research sample comprised 623 undergraduate students \n(476 females and 147 males). The participants included in the study were randomly \nselected, and all of them expressed their willingness to participate in the research. Thus, \nthe sample size utilized in this study was appropriate and sufficient for achieving the \nresearch objectives. The appropriate minimum sample size was determined by apply-\ning Thompson’s [68] equation with a confidence level of 95% and a margin of error of \n5%.

The participants were drawn from diverse academic disci-\nplines, with 49% representing scientific fields and 51% representing the humanities. \nThe respondents’ cumulative average spanned a range from poor to excellent. \nThe study revealed that the respondents were predominantly first-year students, \naccounting for 32.4% of the sample. Second, third, and fourth-year students repre -\nsented 26.2%, 31%, and 9.3% of the sample, respectively. In contrast, fifth- and sixth-\nyear students constituted a minority, comprising only 0.8% and 0.3% of the sample, \nrespectively. This distribution can be attributed to the fact that most of the majors \noffered by the university are designed to be completed within four years. The study \nfound that most respondents, precisely 50.1%, possessed rudimentary technologi -\ncal skills, indicating a beginner level of proficiency. Meanwhile, 34.3% and 10.8% \nof the participants demonstrated intermediate and advanced technological skills, \nrespectively.\n3.2\t Study\tinstrument\nA study was conducted utilizing a web-based, self-administered questionnaire \nto examine the attitudes of undergraduate students towards utilizing ChatGPT as \na learning tool. The authors of this study utilized the ABC model of attitude and \nextant literature. It was used to examine students’ attitudes toward the utilization of \ninnovative technologies, such as chatbots, robots, and computers, in the context of \nlearning to develop the study instrument [54] [69–73].\nThe questionnaire comprised a total of 27 items, which were categorized into \ntwo distinct sections: the first includes five items (1–5) for collecting demographic \ndata. The second includes the attitudes towards using ChatGPT (ATUC) scale, which \nwas employed to evaluate undergraduate students’ attitudes toward ChatGPT as a \nlearning tool. The completion of the ATUC scale required approximately 30 minutes. \nThe ATUC comprised 22 items (6–26) that were distributed across three subscales: \na) the affects subscale (comprising seven items, 6–12), b) the cognitive subscale \n(comprising eight items, 13–20), and c) the behavioral subscale (comprising seven \nitems, 21–27). The ATUC scale employed a 5-point Likert scale ranging from level 1, \nwhich represents “strongly disagree,” to level 5, which represents “strongly agree.” \nThe results indicate that the mean values of the ATUC scale fell within the range \nof 1.0–2.33, indicating a low level of positive attitudes towards the utilization of \nChatGPT as a learning tool. Scores ranging from 2.34 to 3.66 indicated moderately \npositive attitudes towards using ChatGPT as a learning tool. Conversely, scores rang-\ning from 3.67 to 5.0 indicated highly positive attitudes towards using ChatGPT as a \nlearning tool.\nPsychometrics properties of the ATUC:  The content validity of the ATUC \nwas assessed by ten experts from various Jordanian universities who specialize in \ncurriculum and instruction, educational psychology, instructional technology, and \ncomputer science. Additionally, a pilot study was conducted with 80 undergraduate \nstudents from the study population and outside the study sample to ensure internal \nvalidity and reliability. The ATUC was administered on the pilot sample (n = 80), and \nanalysis found that the Pearson correlation coefficients for each item of the ATUC \nscale and the overall ATUC score fell within the range of 0.48 to 0.83 and were all \ndeemed statistically significant at p < 0.05. Further the Pearson correlation coeffi -\ncients for each item of the ATUC scale and the overall score for the belonging sub -\nscale are higher than 0.48, as shown in Table 2.\n 106 International Journal of Interactive Mobile Technologies (iJIM) iJIM | Vol. 17 No. 18 (2023)\nAjlouni et al.\nTable 2.

The sta-\ntistical analysis was conducted utilizing SPSS software, version 23.\n4\t RESULTS\tAND\tDISCUSSION\nTo address the study question, SQ1: What is the attitude of undergraduate students \nat the University of Jordan regarding using ChatGPT as a learning tool? Descriptive \nstatistics were extracted, i.e., means, standard deviations, frequencies, and percent -\nages of the responses of the study sample on the ATUC measure and their subscales, \nnamely the affective, cognitive, and behavioral subscales.\nTable 5 displays that the average score of attitudes toward ChatGPT as a learning \ntool among undergraduates at the University of Jordan is 3.74. This score suggests \nthat the students held positive attitudes towards utilizing ChatGPT as a learning tool. \nFurthermore, there was a variation observed in the average scores of the three \nattitude components toward ChatGPT among the undergraduate participants. The \nresults indicate that the mean score for the affective attitude component is 3.65, indi-\ncating a moderate level. The affective component represents the emotional response \ntowards an attitude object, i.e., liking or disliking [50]. In contrast, the cognitive com-\nponent has a mean score of 3.77, and the behavioral component of attitude among \nundergraduates is 3.81, which is considered high. Cognitive components are an esti-\nmation of the entity that refers to the assessment of an individual’s opinion, i.e., \nbelief or disbelief about the object [50]. The cognitive and affective components of \nattitude play a significant role in determining behavioral intention, which serves as \nthe immediate motivating factor for actual behavior [74].\nTable 5. Descriptive statistics of undergraduates responding to ATUC\nATUC Subscale Mean Std. Deviation Level\nAffective 3.65 1.10 Moderate\nCognitive 3.77 1.00 High\nBehavioral 3.81 1.01 High\nTotal 3.74 1.03 High\n 108 International Journal of Interactive Mobile Technologies (iJIM) iJIM | Vol. 17 No. 18 (2023)\nAjlouni et al.\nTable 6 showed that the average score for the affective component of attitudes \ntowards using ChatGPT as a learning tool among undergraduate students at the \nUniversity of Jordan was 3.65, indicating a moderately positive level. This implies that \nthe students had moderately positive emotions towards ChatGPT as a learning tool. \nAs evidenced by the data presented in Table 6, the affective subscale responses of the \nundergraduates were moderately averaged, except for items 6, 7, and 8, which were \nhighly averaged. The responses indicate that undergraduate students exhibit posi -\ntive attitudes towards acquiring knowledge about ChatGPT; they feel comfortable and \nenjoy using it in the context of their academic pursuits. [43] indicates the motivational \nability of ChatGPT. Moreover, concerning item 9, it was reported that 20.7% of the \nparticipants disagreed that they feel at ease employing ChatGPT in their educational \nendeavors. This implies that particular participants may require additional instruction \nor assistance to effectively utilize ChatGPT for educational purposes. Providing guid-\nance may increase their comfort level and improve their overall platform perception.\nIn addition, the results of items 10, 11, and 12 indicate that a mere 15% of undergrad-\nuate participants agree or strongly agree with the statement that they experience annoy-\nance while using ChatGPT due to the lack of human interaction. In addition, a notable \nproportion of participants, precisely 20.7%, expressed agreement or strong agreement \nthat they feel concerned about utilizing ChatGPT to accomplish their academic tasks. \nThis attitude is due to the potential for ChatGPT to generate imprecise outcomes. The \nabove concerns are in line with the study findings by [14] that demonstrated concern \nregarding the incorrect and inaccurate information that ChatGPT could generate.\nMoreover, 14.6% of participants agree or strongly agree with experiencing ner -\nvousness in the absence of ChatGPT service. This suggests a dependence on ChatGPT \ntechnology, potentially leading to addictive behavior. Feeling anxiety and nervous -\nness in the absence of technological tools are symptoms of technological tool addic -\ntion that hinder individuals from concentrating on their work or learning [75]. \nFurther, users of contemporary technologies could demonstrate high levels of emo -\ntional dependency on a modern technological tool, causing technological addiction, \nwhich is an excessive and extreme use of technology involving non-human interac-\ntions [76]. Thus, there is a pressing need to address and prevent ChatGPT addiction \namong these individuals. The affective components of the attitude of these under -\ngraduate students toward ChatGPT was shaped by their emotions concerning its use \nas a tool for learning. The findings of this study suggest that decision-makers and \neducators must address the concerns of students effectively. By raising awareness \nand by providing guidance on using ChatGPT as a learning tool, this can be achieved.\nTable 6.

The cognitive component \nof attitude pertains to the cognitive processes involved in an individual’s attitudes \ntowards a psychological object, including beliefs and thoughts regarding technology \n[74]. Table 7 displays the results, indicating that the participants rated the cognitive \nsubscale items highly, except for items 16 and 17, which are related to the perceived \nimpact of ChatGPT on academic self-confidence and writing skills, respectively. The \nresults indicate a moderate level of agreement among respondents, with over 60% \nexpressing that ChatGPT has the potential to improve their academic self-confidence \nand writing skills. This is in line with the results of previous studies that found that \nchatbots increase students’ self-confidence and improve writing skills [42] [77]. In \naddition, the study revealed a high level of agreement among participants concerning \nthe potential of ChatGPT in facilitating the learning process, as evidenced by 73.2% \nof students agreeing. Most students agreed that the skills for employing ChatGPT in \nlearning are necessary, make the learning process easier and the learning experience \nbetter, satisfy their learning needs, support their lifelong learning, promote their eval-\nuation and higher-order skills, and foster creativity. These strong positive beliefs about \nusing ChatGPT in a learning process contribute to their high positive level on the cog-\nnitive subscale of the ATUC. As well, this result is in line with findings from previous \nstudies that highlighted the potential of ChatGPT in education [14] [38] [42] [44].\nTable 7.

ChatGPT improves higher-order skills, i.e. Evaluation and creativity 3.9 6.7 21.0 45.6 22.8 3.77 ± 1.00\nTotal 3.77 ± 1.00\nSimilarly, it was found that undergraduate students exhibited a high level of \nbehavioral component (m = 3.81) in their attitudes towards ChatGPT. It indicates \ntheir inclination towards utilizing the platform as a tool for their educational pur -\nsuits, where public acceptance is influenced by behavioral factors [78]. Further, \nthe behavioral component of attitudes encompasses an individual’s reaction and \nresponse, i.e., whether it is favorable or unfavorable to do something concerning the \nattitude objects [50]. Table 8 displays the results of the behavioral subscale items, \ndemonstrating that the majority of student respondents provided high average rat -\nings. Except for item 23 (regarding the use of ChatGPT as a tutor), approximately \n15% of respondents expressed disagreement with the notion of using ChatGPT as \na tutor. This may be attributed to various factors, such as the need for more profi -\nciency or knowledge in utilizing ChatGPT, concerns regarding the accuracy of gen -\nerated data, and limitations associated with ChatGPT, such as the absence of human \ninteraction. However, further research is required to explore these factors in greater \n 110 International Journal of Interactive Mobile Technologies (iJIM) iJIM | Vol. 17 No. 18 (2023)\nAjlouni et al.\ndepth. Nevertheless, the majority of participants agree that they would utilize \nChatGPT to attain their learning goals, employing it as a pedagogical tool for exer -\ncising, practicing, exam readiness, summarizing and analyzing educational content, \nkeeping abreast of its advancements, and apprising their friends and colleagues of \nChatGPT’s advantageous academic proficiencies.\nUndergraduate students hold a positive intent to use ChatGPT in their learning, \nwhich could be attributed to their solid belief regarding the advantages of utilizing \nChatGPT in education and their exhibition of favorable emotion regarding ChatGPT \ntechnology since behavioral intention is a direct result of the affective and cognitive \ncomponents of attitude [74], as well as prior research findings suggesting that indi -\nviduals’ behavior is positively impacted by their perceived benefits [79].\nTable 8.

This \nfinding could be attributed to the various pedagogical benefits the students perceive \nto be associated with the ChatGPT platform. Implementing this technology enables \nuninterrupted communication throughout the day, enhancing student involvement \nby offering adaptable and confidential communication avenues that cater to the stu-\ndent’s requirements. Furthermore, instant messaging systems facilitate improved \nstudent communication, enabling them to participate in more meaningful dialogues, \nrespond to inquiries requiring elaboration, and receive prompt support. In addition, \nit has been reported that chatbots allow students to access information and enhance \ntheir communication skills through practice and refinement [26] [41] [44] [80].\nStudents’ attitudes towards ChatGPT as a learning tool were not the focus of all \nof the research. So this limited the ability to compare this study’s findings with pre -\nvious studies, so we relate them to previous studies that involved chatbots or AI. \nHowever, the result of positive attitudes towards ChatGPT as a learning tool among \nundergraduate students is consistent with the study’s finding [58], which revealed \nthat Twitter users have positive attitudes towards ChatGPT in education. Also, it is \nin line with the previous studies by [60] and [64] that have demonstrated positive \nattitudes towards using AI among medical and healthcare students. Furthermore, \nthe findings of this investigation are connsistent with a study conducted in Jordan \nby [63], which found that medical students believe in the significance of AI in the field  \nof medicine. Moreover, research [61] found that the attitude among teachers’ towards \niJIM | Vol. 17 No. 18 (2023) International Journal of Interactive Mobile Technologies (iJIM) 111\nStudents’ Attitudes Towards Using ChatGPT as a Learning Tool: The Case of the University of Jordan\nutilizing chatbots in the teaching and learning process was positive. However, the \nstudy result of high positive attitudes towards ChatGPT among undergraduates is \npartly in conflict with some related previous studies, such as [57], which found the \noverall attitudes towards ChatGPT among Twitter users are largely neutral to posi -\ntive, and [62], which revealed a moderate degree of teachers’ attitudes towards uti -\nlizing ChatGPT in special needs education. Also, the study result is contrary to [59], in \nwhich faculty members had negative attitudes towards ChatGPT. These conflicting \nresults could be attributed to several reasons, the most important of which is the \nvariation in the target population and culture of the previous studies. These studies \nhave been conducted in several countries, such as Pakistan, Germany, Jordan, and \nothers. Additionally, some studies have investigated different variables, such as stu-\ndents’ attitudes, teachers’ attitudes, or Twitter users’ attitudes. Furthermore, some \nstudies have examined attitudes towards artificial intelligence or chatbots. Also, \nscholars have indicated that attitudes are influenced by cultural factors [81], and \nattitudes towards using information technology could change over time [82].\nThe present investigation highlights the necessity of preserving and advancing \nfavorable attitudes towards ChatGPT technology to facilitate its adoption as a via -\nble learning tool. Nonetheless, this underscores the need for particular students \nto receive additional education to alter their concerns about ChatGPT utilization. \nFurthermore, the findings emphasize the significance of conducting further com -\nprehensive investigations to inspect students’ affective dispositions concerning their \nanxiety experience in the absence of ChatGPT services. This sentiment may suggest \nthe potentiality of technology addiction and reliance. This underscores the need for \nadditional research, specifically in addiction and technophile. The latter encom -\npasses not only a favorable disposition toward technology but also dependence and \ntechnological reputation, as previously noted [25]. Further, the absence of a study \nthat investigated students’ attitudes towards ChatGPT emphasized the need to repli-\ncate this study on a different population.\n5\t \tCONCLUSIONS\nThe uniqueness of this study is that it is the first to evaluate undergraduates’ \nattitudes regarding utilizing ChatGPT as a learning tool. The researchers developed \na measure based on the ABC model of the attitude’s components, including emo -\ntional, cognitive, and behavioral variables forming the attitude. The significance of \nthis study lies in the influence of attitudes on the adoption and incorporation of tech-\nnology, particularly in the realm of education. The present descriptive study design \nusing a quantitative approach was carried out in Jordan during the second semester \nof the academic year 2022–2023, encompassing a total of 623 undergraduate stu -\ndents who were enrolled at the University of Jordan.\nThe study’s findings indicate that ChatGPT is perceived as a valuable learning \ntool, with participants exhibiting predominantly positive attitudes toward its use. \nSpecifically, the results suggest that the affective component of attitudes was moder-\nately positive, while the cognitive and behavioral components were highly positive. \nFurthermore, a significant proportion of undergraduate students (73.2%) agreed on \nthe potential of ChatGPT to enhance the learning experience. Nonetheless, some par-\nticipants expressed reservations regarding the precision of the data produced by \nChatGPT, with a percentage of 20.7%. Similarly, an equivalent percentage (20.7%) \nreported feeling difficulty utilizing ChatGPT for educational purposes.\n 112 International Journal of Interactive Mobile Technologies (iJIM) iJIM | Vol. 17 No. 18 (2023)\nAjlouni et al.\nConversely, a fraction of the respondents reported experiencing anxiety in the \nevent of the unavailability of ChatGPT services, with 14.6%. The discoveries above \naid decision-makers at the Ministry of Higher Education and educators at the \nUniversity of Jordan in devising protocols and strategies for incorporating ChatGPT \ninto the curriculum and instructional framework, as well as in taking measures to \ntackle student concerns and the potential for ChatGPT to be misused. One poten -\ntial strategy for promoting the effective use of ChatGPT as an educational tool is to \norganize workshops and training sessions. These events could enhance the literacy \nand awareness of undergraduate students regarding the benefits and best practices \nassociated with ChatGPT.\nThe research encountered certain limitations regarding the study population. \nInitially, it should be noted that the research solely comprised undergraduate stu -\ndents enrolled at one public university in the metropolitan area of Jordan’s capital \ncity. Furthermore, the study exclusively included a sample size of 623 undergrad -\nuate students. The constraints above imply that educational researchers should \nundertake similar investigations across diverse cohorts and explore additional phys-\niological concerns like addiction.\n6\t REFERENCES\n [1] M.W.
