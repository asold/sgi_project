INTRODUCTION\nThe transformer PD monitoring can not only reﬂect the early\ninsulation failure of the transformers but also evaluate the\ninsulation state and severity by judging the type of PD [1], [2].\nThe accurate recognition of PD types is the prerequisite for\nanalyzing the insulation faults and guiding the transformer’s\nmaintenance operation [3], [4]. Therefore, the PD pattern\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Wei-Yen Hsu\n.\nrecognition of the transformers is of great signiﬁcance for the\nsafe and stable operation of the power system [5]–[7].\nThe feature extraction and classiﬁer design are the two\nmost important stages in PD pattern recognition [8]. In recent\nyears, varieties of feature extraction algorithms and pattern\nclassiﬁers have been applied to the transformer PD pattern\nrecognition. Based on the PRPD maps, the statistical data of\nPD amplitude, the number, and distribution characteristics\nof PD pulses can be obtained [9], [10]. The transformer\nPD pattern recognition can be realized by combining the\nPD feature extraction of PRPD maps and the PD pattern\n102422 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

The PRPD maps are used as PD samples and\nare transformed into the PRPD grayscale images. The ANN\nclassiﬁer is used to extract the sample features and recognize\nthe PD types [12]. However, practically, the PD samples of\ntransformers are very limited, and the sample needs of the\nANN classiﬁer cannot be met, which leads to the underﬁtting\nof the ANN classiﬁer. To reach a stable recognition perfor-\nmance of the classiﬁer in practical applications, the simple\nclustering classiﬁer, and statistical features are used in [13].\nHowever, there are still some problems in this method, such\nas the poor distinguishability of PD statistical features and\nlow recognition speed. In contrast, the SVM classiﬁer has the\nadvantages of fast recognition speed and less sample demand,\ntherefore it gains wide application due to its good recognition\nperformance [14].\nThe GLCM has been used to extract the PD features from\nthe PRPD grayscale images effectively [15], [16], which has\ngood PD feature distinguishability. However, the angle-offset\nparameter θ used to calculate the GLCM has several val-\nues and is usually determined artiﬁcially, which results in\na bad self-adaptability [17]. If the value of the angle-offset\nparameter θ is not reasonably determined, the distinguisha-\nbility of the corresponding GLCM features will be greatly\nreduced, and the features cannot reﬂect the essential charac-\nteristics of PD well [18]. To solve this problem, the gray-level\nco-occurrence matrices corresponding to all values of the\nangle-offset parameter θare calculated. And then the average\nvalue of all gray-level co-occurrence matrices is calculated\nas the ﬁnal GLCM to extract the features [19]. However,\nthe method of calculating the average of all gray-level\nco-occurrence matrices requires mass computation and can-\nnot retain the characteristics of all types of PD samples.\nIn addition, the dimension of the feature space extracted by\nthe existing PD pattern recognition algorithm is higher. The\nhigh dimension of feature space leads to a long recognition\ntime and poor generalization ability, which cannot meet the\nreal-time recognition speed and accuracy requirements.\nConsidering the above research gaps, a transformer PD\npattern recognition algorithm based on the GLCM of optimal\nparameters and SVM (GLCMOP-SVM) is proposed. This\nalgorithm can adaptively determine the optimal value of the\nangle-offset parameter θ according to the measured PRPD\nmaps. We only need to calculate the GLCMOP corresponding\nto the optimal angle-offset parameter θ and extract the fea-\ntures of GLCMOP, the GLCM corresponding to other values\nof the angle-offset parameter θ does not need to be calcu-\nlated. Therefore, the proposed method can not only reﬂect\nthe PD features well, but also reduce the calculation burden.\nMoreover, the feature space of PD samples is dimensionally\nreduced by screening out the features with high distinguisha-\nbility, which is based on the three-dimensional distribution\nmaps and the intersection of the probability distribution. The\nfeature space of PD samples which has low dimension and\nhigh distinguishability features reduces the training time of\nthe classiﬁer and improves the recognition accuracy. Further-\nmore, the GLCMOP-SVM is compared with other pattern\nFIGURE 1.

Comparison results show that the per-\nformance of GLCMOP-SVM is better than that of the other\nsimilar pattern recognition methods.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows.\nIn Section II, the PD test platform based on the integral insula-\ntion structure of the transformer and the generation processes\nof PRPD maps are illustrated, then the GLCM principle and\nhow to use the GLCM to extract the features of PRPD maps\nare introduced. A description of the GLCMOP-based feature\nextraction method and the distinguishability screening of\nfeatures are introduced in Section III. Section IV highlights\nthe GLCMOP-SVM with a discussion about the experimental\nresults and a comparison with a few previous pattern recogni-\ntion methods. Finally, the conclusions are given in Section V.\nII. THE PRPD MAPMS ACQUISITION AND GLCM-BASED\nFEATURE EXTRACTION\nA. THE PRPD MAPS ACQUISITION\nAccording to the common PD types of insulation defects\nin the transformers, three typical insulation defects models\nare constructed, which include the tip discharge, surface dis-\ncharge, and air discharge types [20] as shown in Fig.1. In this\npaper, the transformer with an air-epoxy resin insulation\nstructure is used as an example to illustrate the insulation\ndefects model. Moreover, the PD test insulation defect model\nis designed to occur in the closed air epoxy insulation to\nmake the simulated PD reﬂect the actual transformer PD well.\nThe enclosed air epoxy insulation model adopts the overall\ntransformer structure as depicted in Fig.2.\nThe PD model is connected to the PD test circuit to form\na test platform. The above three types of insulation defect\nmodels are used for the PD test data acquisition. The PD test\nplatform circuit and the ﬁeld test picture are depicted in Fig.3.\nIn the PD test platform, T 1 is the tap-changing transformer,\nT2 is the test transformer without PD, R 1 is the protective\nresistance, R2 is the measuring resistance, C 1 is the coupling\ncapacitor.\nDuring the test, the voltage is increased step by step and\nthe ultra-high frequency (UHF) sensors are used to collect\nVOLUME 9, 2021 102423\nS.

The PD test model has a closed air-epoxy resin insulation\nstructure similar to the transformer.\nFIGURE 3. The PD test platform circuit diagram (a) and field test\npicture (b).\nthe PD data of the three PD models. The collected PD data\nis used to establish the sample database of PRPD maps for\nthe subsequent feature extraction and pattern recognition. The\nspeciﬁc test steps are listed as follows:\n(1) A PD insulation defect model is selected and connected\nto the test circuit.\n(2) The background noise of the laboratory is determined.\nBefore the voltage is applied, the signal detected by the\nsignal acquisition system is the background noise in the\nPD test environment.\n(3) The inception voltage of PD is determined. The voltage\nof the tap-changing transformer is increased evenly and\nslowly step by step. When the PD signal is detected by\nthe monitoring instrument, the corresponding voltage\nis recorded as the initial voltage U1.\n(4) The PD data are generated and collected with dif-\nferent voltage supplies. The voltage is continuously\nincreased, when it is larger than 1.5 times U1, a stable\nand obvious PD signal series can be seen in the mon-\nitoring system. And then the voltage is still increased\nto about twice U1. The PD data generated during this\nprocess are collected by the UHF sensors.\n(5) Different types of insulation defect models are\nreplaced. After completing the PD test of the current\nPD insulation defect model, the voltage is slowly low-\nered and the power is turned off. The discharge rod\nis used to discharge the test circuit and the insulation\ndefect model is replaced with another one. And then\nthe (2) to (5) steps of the test are repeated until all the\nthree types of PD data are collected.\nFIGURE 4. PRPD maps of the three different PD types.

Sunet al.: PD Pattern Recognition of Transformers Based on GLCM of Optimal Parameters\ntypes obtained based on the ﬁeld test data. The process of\ngenerating the PRPD maps shown in the paper are listed as\nfollows:\n(1) The UHF sensors monitor the PD pulse signal, and the\nmonitored PD pulse signal carries time stamp and amplitude\ninformation.\n(2) Based on the time stamp information and amplitude\ninformation of each pulse signal, the time stamp of the pulse\nsignal is converted into the horizontal coordinate (phase)\nof the pulse point in the PRPD map, and the amplitude\ninformation of the pulse point is converted into the vertical\ncoordinate of the pulse point in the PRPD map, and the\nvertical coordinate is the amplitude in dBm.\nThe PD pulse signal monitored by the UHF sensors is the\npower signal, and the amplitude unit of the PD pulse signal\nis mW. To be a more intuitive display of the pulse signal in\nthe PRPD map, the amplitude of the pulse signal is converted\nfrom mW to dBm. The conversion formula corresponding to\nbenchmark 0dBm is:\n0dBm =10lg (1mW) (1)\n(3) We draw the pulse points (50 cycles) in 1s into a PRPD\nmap, i.e., each PRPD map contains information about the PD\npulses collected by the sensors in 1s. Pulse signals with the\nsame phase and amplitude are represented by a pulse point in\nthe PRPD map, and the color of the pulse point represents the\nnumber of pulse signals with the same phase and amplitude.\nIn the PRPD map, by looking at the vertical and horizontal\ncoordinates of a pulse point, we can directly obtain informa-\ntion about the phase and amplitude of the pulse. To visualize\nthe phase corresponding to the moment of pulse generation,\nthe waveform of one cycle of the sinusoidal function is added\nto the PRPD map. In addition, on the right side of the PRPD\nmap is a color bar marked with values (from 1 to 10). Differ-\nent colors on the color bar are marked with different values\nbecause the color of the pulse points represents the number of\npulse points at that position in 50 cycles. For example, light\ngreen is marked with the value 4, and dark green is marked\nwith the value 1 in the color bar.\nAs shown in Fig.4 (c), we can see that the color of the\npulse points in the PRPD map is different. At a phase of 285 ◦\nand an amplitude of −31.25 dBm, the pulse point is light\ngreen, the color of the pulse point at that position is similar to\nthe color of the position marked by value 4 in the color bar,\ni.e., there are four pulse points at that position (i.e., there are\nfour pulse points with the phase and amplitude correspond-\ning to that position in 50 cycles). Similarly, at a phase of\n300◦and an amplitude of −25 dBm, the pulse point is light\ngreen, which means that there is only one pulse point at that\nposition.\nIt can be seen that the PRPD maps can well reﬂect the\nnumber of PD pulses times, the amplitude, and spatial dis-\ntribution of PD pulses, therefore, they can be used for the\nfeature extraction. The extracted features can well reﬂect\nthe characteristics of various types of PRPD maps to ﬁnally\nachieve pattern recognition of PD.\nFIGURE 5. The differentθ values of the interested pixel underd = 1.\nB. THE FEATURE EXTRACTION OF PD BASED ON GLCM\nThe PRPD maps are converted into the PRPD grayscale\nimages to determine the GLCM. Firstly, the number of PD\npulses per unit area in the PRPD map is calculated and\nthe maximum and the minimum number of PD pulses per\nunit area are found out, based on which the maximum and\nminimum of gray-level are determined. The higher the gray-\nlevel, the more PD pulses. After that, the gray-level of each\npixel in the PRPD map can be determined, and then the\nPRPD grayscale image can be ﬁnally obtained [21]. The pulse\nphase, the pulse amplitude, and the number of PD pulses\nin the PRPD maps are reﬂected by the spatial structure, the\nspatial position, and the gray-level of the pixel pulses in the\nPRPD grayscale images. Since the GLCM can statistically\nanalyze the pixel pairs in the grayscale images, so it is\nvery appropriate to be used to extract the features of PRPD\ngrayscale images [22].\nThe GLCM is deﬁned as the probability value of\nthe appearance of a pair of pixels [23]. The gray-levels of\nthe pixel pair are represented by i and j, which represent the\ngray-levels of the interested pixel and another pixel in the\nselected pixel pair, respectively. The mathematical expression\nof the GLCM with the angle-offset parameter θ and pixel\ndistance d is shown in (1),\nP (i,j;d,θ)=\n{\n(x,y),(x+d,y+d)\n⏐⏐⏐⏐\n⏐\nf (x,y)=i\nf (x+d,y+d)=j\n(2)\nwhere (x ,y) is the pixel coordinates, x = 1,2,..., Nx,\ny =1,2,..., Ny, Nx, and Ny represent the number of rows\nand columns of the grayscale images. θ is the angle-offset\nparameter between the pixel pair and the coordinate axis,\nwhose values are 0 ◦, 45 ◦, 90 ◦or 135 ◦. d is the distance\nbetween the interested pixel and another pixel in the pixel\npair. To better explain the parameter θand d of the pixel pair,\nthe different θ values of the interested pixel under d =1 is\nshown in Fig. 5.\nThe GLCM corresponding to the grayscale image with\ngray-level 8 when θ = 0 ◦ and d = 1 is shown in Fig.6\nto better illustrate the generation process of GLCM. In this\nexample, the left matrix is the gray-level matrix of the original\nimage, the right matrix is the corresponding GLCM gener-\nated. The maximum value of gray-level in the left matrix\ndetermines the number of rows and columns of the right\nVOLUME 9, 2021 102425\nS. Sunet al.: PD Pattern Recognition of Transformers Based on GLCM of Optimal Parameters\nFIGURE 6. Schematic diagram of the GLCM generation.\nmatrix (GLCM). And the number of gray-level combinations\nin the left matrix corresponds to the value in the correspond-\ning coordinate in the GLCM. For example, if i =1 and j =1\noccurs once, GLCM (1,1) =1, if i =1 and j =2 occurs\ntwice, GLCM (1,2) =2.\nThe GLCM can statistically analyze all the pixels in the\nthree types of PRPD grayscale images, which can well reﬂect\nthe comprehensive information of grayscale images in direc-\ntion, variation amplitude, and local neighborhood distribu-\ntion. After the GLCM corresponding to the PRPD grayscale\nimage is obtained, we can extract the features from the GLCM\nfor the subsequent pattern recognition.\nFeature extraction is a key step in PD pattern recognition.\nThe features of PRPD grayscale images extracted in this\npaper are divided into two categories. One is the moment\nfeatures of GLCM, such as Energy, Entropy, Contrast, Homo-\ngeneity, and Correlation [24], [25]. The other is the fractal\nfeatures of the two-dimensional image, such as the Solidity,\nEuler number of the binary image (Euler), mean of matrix\nelements (Mean2), and two-dimension correlation coefﬁcient\n(Corr2). The combination use of the GLCM features and the\nfractal features of the two-dimensional image can reﬂect the\ncharacteristics of PRPD grayscale images more comprehen-\nsively. For the n-level GLCM, the mathematical formulas of\nthe above the moment features of GLCM are listed as follows:\n(1) Energy:\nENE =\nn∑\ni=1\nn∑\nj=1\n[P(i,j;d,θ)]2 (3)\nENE is the sum of squares of the elements of GLCM,\nwhich reﬂects the uniformity of the gray-level distribution\nand texture thickness.\n(2) Entropy:\nENT =−\nn∑\ni=1\nn∑\nj=1\nP(i,j;d,θ) logP(i,j;d,θ) (4)\nENT represents the amount of information in the image,\nwhich reﬂects the complexity of the texture. When the ele-\nment distribution in the co-occurrence matrix is scattered\nand random, the gray-level of the texture is complex and the\nentropy will have a large value.\n(3) Contrast:\nCON =\nn∑\ni=1\nn∑\nj=1\n[\n(i −j)2 P(i,j;d,θ)\n]2\n(5)\nCON is also known as the moment of inertia, reﬂecting the\nclarity of the image and the depth of the texture grooves. The\ndeeper the texture groove, the greater the contrast, the clearer\nthe visual effect.\n(4) Homogeneity:\nHOM =\nn∑\ni=1\nn∑\nj=1\nP (i,j;d,θ)\n1 +|i −j| (6)\nHOM measures how close the elements in GLCM are to\nthe diagonal elements of GLCM in the same row.\n(5) Correlation:\nCOR =\nn∑\ni=1\nn∑\nj=1\n(ij)P (i,j;d,θ)−µx µy\nσx σy\n(7)\nCOR measures the similarity of GLCM elements in each\nrow or each column, which reﬂects the linear correlation\nof the image gray-level. If the gray-level is continuous in a\ncertain direction, the correlation value is high. In (7), µx , µy\nand σx , σy are deﬁned as follows:\nµx =\nn∑\ni=1\nn∑\nj=1\nx ×P (i,j;d,θ) (8)\nµy =\nn∑\ni=1\nn∑\nj=1\ny ×P (i,j;d,θ) (9)\nσx =\nn∑\ni=1\nn∑\nj=1\n(i −µx )2 ×P (i,j;d,θ) (10)\nσy =\nn∑\ni=1\nn∑\nj=1\n(\nj −µy\n)2 ×P (i,j;d,θ) (11)\nIt can be seen that the features of GLCM described above\ncan well reﬂect the characteristics of the PRPD grayscale\nimages, including the uniformity and thickness of the\ngray-level distribution, the complexity and non-uniformity\nof the texture, the clarity and depth of the texture, and the\nsimilarity of the local gray-level of the images [26], [27].\nTherefore, the GLCM is very suitable for extracting the fea-\ntures of the PRPD grayscale images.\nIII. FEATURE EXTRACTION OF PRPD MAPS BASED ON\nGLCMOP\nA. DETERMINE THE GLCMOP\nFrom Section II, we know that the values of angle-offset\nparameter θ and distance d need to be determined before\nthe calculation of GLCM. The value of θ includes 0 ◦,\n45 ◦, 90 ◦ or 135 ◦. Each angle-offset parameter θ corre-\nsponds to a different GLCM. The value of θ has a greater\nimpact on the characteristics of GLCM than the value of d.\n102426 VOLUME 9, 2021\nS. Sunet al.: PD Pattern Recognition of Transformers Based on GLCM of Optimal Parameters\nThe feature space of PRPD maps for the pattern recogni-\ntion comes from GLCM, that is to say, the distinguishabil-\nity of features depends on the ability of GLCM to reﬂect\nthe characteristics of PRPD grayscale images. Therefore,\nit is very important to determine the optimal value of the\nangle-offset parameter θ. The feature space of PD samples\ncorresponding to the GLCMOP is the one with the highest\ndistinguishability.\nThe pixel pairs in GLCM corresponding to the PRPD\ngrayscale images are analyzed. The value of the elements\nin GLCM can reﬂect the number of the three types of pixel\npairs. GLCM (1, 1) is the number of background pixel pairs\nin the PRPD grayscale images. Secondly, the gray-level of\nthe two pixels in the pixel pairs are different, which are the\nunequal pixel pairs. And the number of the unequal pixel pairs\nin the PRPD grayscale images is reﬂected by the off-diagonal\nelement of GLCM ( i,j). In addition, the number of the third\ntype of pixel pairs, which have the same gray-level images\ncalled the equal pixels, is reﬂected by the element of GLCM\n(i,j), where i =j ̸=1. Among the three types of pixel pairs,\nthe unequal pixel pairs can best reﬂect the characteristics\nof PRPD grayscale images. Because the unequal pixel pairs\ncontain the boundary information between the PD pulses and\nthe background of PRPD grayscale images, also contain the\ndensity changing information of the PD pulses aggregation\narea.\nTherefore, the GLCMOP with the optimal angle-offset\nparameter θ should meet the requirement that the unequal\npixel pairs have the highest proportion in all pixel pairs.\nAmong all gray-level co-occurrence matrices, the ratio of the\nnumber of unequal pixel pairs to the number of equal pixel\npairs in GLCMOP is the largest. Therefore, the proportion of\nthe off-diagonal elements in GLCM (PODE) is proposed to\ndetermine GLCMOP. The formula of PODE is shown in (12).\nPODE =ODES\nDES\n(12)\nwhere ODES is the sum of the values of off-diagonal ele-\nments, and DES is the sum of the values of diagonal elements\nafter removing the background pixels, and they can be calcu-\nlated according to (13) and (14),\nODES =\nn∑\ni=1\nn∑\nj=1\nGLCM (i,j)−\nn∑\ni=j=1\nGLCM (i,j) (13)\nDES =\nn∑\ni=1\nn∑\nj=1\nGLCM (i,j)−GLCM (1,1) (14)\nwhere n is the maximum order of GLCM, which is also the\nmaximum gray-level.\nAfter all the PODE of gray-level co-occurrence matri-\nces corresponding to all angle-offset parameters θ are cal-\nculated, the angle-offset parameter θ corresponding to the\nmaximum value of PODE is determined to be the optimal\nangle-offset parameter θ. The GLCM with the optimal angle-\noffset parameter θ is called the GLCMOP, whose features\nFIGURE 7. The values ofPODE with different angle-offsetθ.\nTABLE 1. PODE of GLCM corresponding to different angle-offset\nparameters θ.\nhave the highest distinguishability. Moreover, the subjectiv-\nity in determining the value of angle migration parameter\nθ is avoided and the calculation burden of feature extrac-\ntion is reduced by determining the GLCMOP. The PODE\nof gray-level co-occurrence matrices corresponding to three\ntypes of PRPD grayscale images under different angle-offset\nparameters θare shown in Fig.7.\nIt can be seen from Fig.7 that when the angle-offset\nparameter θ are 45 ◦, 90 ◦and 135 ◦, the PODE of gray-level\nco-occurrence matrices corresponding to the PRPD grayscale\nimages is high. In other words, with these values of\nangle-offset parameter θ, the calculated GLCM can better\nreﬂect the characteristics of PRPD grayscale images. The\noptimal angle-offset parameter θ is determined according\nto the average of all PODE of the gray-level co-occurrence\nmatrices for the three types of PD samples under different θ\nvalues. The PODE results are shown in Table 1.\nIt can be seen that when the angle-offset parameter θis 45◦,\nthe average of PODE for the three types of PD samples is the\nhighest, which has a value of 0.706. Therefore, the optimal\nangle-offset θ is determined to be 45 ◦and its corresponding\nGLCM is called the GLCMOP of PRPD grayscale images,\nwhich is used to extract the features of PRPD grayscale\nimages.\nVOLUME 9, 2021 102427\nS. Sunet al.: PD Pattern Recognition of Transformers Based on GLCM of Optimal Parameters\nWhen the measured PRPD data changes, the GLCMOP is\nupdated according to the PODE index, which improves the\nadaptability of the algorithm.\nB. DISTINGUISHABILITY SCREENING AND\nDIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION OF THE PD FEATURES\nAfter the optimal angle-offset θ is determined, nine fea-\ntures are extracted from the GLCMOP corresponding to each\nPRPD grayscale image. These features can be represented\nby a nine-dimensional vector which can be used for the\nPD classiﬁers. However, with the increase of the number\nof PRPD samples, the data amount of the feature space of\nPD samples composed of this nine-dimensional vector is\nlarge. As a result, the training time of the classiﬁer increases,\nand the convergence of the classiﬁer decreases. Therefore,\nin actual applications, to reduce the memory occupation and\nimprove the recognition speed, the dimension of the feature\nspace should be reduced as much as possible on the premise\nof ensuring recognition accuracy. In this paper, the proba-\nbility distribution parameter and three-dimensional distribu-\ntion maps of PD samples are used to evaluate the feature\ndistinguishability quantitatively and qualitatively. Then the\nfeatures having the highest distinguishability are selected as\nthe ﬁnal features for the pattern recognition.\nThe intersection of probability distribution Jb of features in\nvarious types of PD is used as the distinguishability evalua-\ntion index of features [28], which can comprehensively eval-\nuate the distinguishability from the quantitative perspective.\nIts mathematical expression is shown in (15).\nJb =\n∫\n[p (x |λ1 )p (x |λ2 )]2dx (15)\nIn (15), p(x|λ1) and p(x|λ2) represent the probability den-\nsity of the feature distribution of x in two types of PD. The\nlarger the intersection of probability distribution Jb of feature\nx in the two PD types λ1 and λ2, the worse the ability of\nfeature x to distinguish the PD types λ1 and λ2. That is to\nsay, feature x has a lower distinguishability. In the worst case,\np(x|λ1) and p(x|λ2) are equal and the value of the intersection\nof probability distribution Jb reaches the maximum of 1.\nFeature x is independent of PD types λ1 and λ2, which means\nthat feature x cannot distinguish PD types λ1 and λ2 at all.\nWhen the two data distributions have no intersection at all,\nthe intersection of probability distribution Jb is equal to 0,\nwhich means that feature x can completely distinguish the PD\ntypes λ1 and λ2. The values of the intersection of probability\ndistribution Jb for the nine types of features mentioned in the\nthree types of PD are shown in Table 2.\nIt can be seen from Table 2 that among the nine selected\nfeatures, the intersection of the probability distributions of\nfeature 7 (HOM) in the combination of tip discharge and\nsurface discharge, and that of feature 9 (CORR2) in the\ncombination of surface discharge and air discharge is of the\nsmallest values, which indicates that among all the charac-\nteristic parameters, feature 7 (HOM) and feature 9 (CORR2)\nare the best ones to distinguish the tip discharge and surface\nTABLE 2. The intersection of probability distribution (Jb) of features in\nthree types of PD.\ndischarge, surface discharge and air discharge, respectively.\nSimilarly, feature 8 (COR) and feature 9 (CORR2) have the\nbest discriminating ability to distinguish the surface discharge\nand air discharge, and the Jb of them is approximately to be 0.\nFeature 1 (ENE) and feature 2 (ENT) are the best features to\ndistinguish the tip discharge and air discharge.\nBy analyzing the intersection of the probability distribution\nof features in three types of PD, it is easy to know that the\nJb of features for the combination of tip discharge and air\ngap discharge is larger than those in the other two discharge\ncombinations. That is to say, the combination of tip discharge\nand air discharge is the most difﬁcult one to be distinguished,\nwhile the combination of tip discharge and surface discharge,\nand the combination of surface discharge and air discharge\nare easier to be distinguished. From the average value of\nthe intersection of the probability distribution of features,\nit can be seen that feature 2 (ENT) is the optimal feature of\nPRPD grayscale images. In addition, among the three kinds\nof combinations of discharges, the moment features have the\nsmallest intersection of the probability distribution, so the\nmoment features of PRPD grayscale images are better than\nthe fractal features in distinguishing discharge types.\nIn addition, the distribution of PD samples in three-\ndimensional feature space can complementarily verify the\nquantitative evaluation results. The three-dimensional distri-\nbution map of PD samples can directly reﬂect the overlapping\ndegree and distribution of PD samples in a certain coordinate\naxis direction, i.e., the feature direction, and then qualitatively\njudge the distinguishability of features as shown in Fig.8.\nIt can be seen from the three-dimensional distribution map\nof PD samples that in the feature space of 1 (ENE), 2 (ENT),\n3 (CON) and feature space of 7 (HOM), 8 (COR), 9 (CORR2),\nall types of PD samples have strong aggregation and low\nsample overlap degrees. This is consistent with the calcu-\nlation result of the intersection of the probability distribu-\ntion. Therefore, six features (1 (ENE), 2 ( ENT), 3 ( CON),\n7 (HOM), 8 (COR), and 9 (CORR2)) with high distinguisha-\nbility are selected as the ﬁnal features of pattern recognition\n102428 VOLUME 9, 2021\nS.

The derived feature space can\nFIGURE 9.

CLASSIFIER TRAINING AND RECOGNITION PROCESS\nAnother key step of pattern recognition is to build a classiﬁer.\nThe classiﬁer adopted in this paper is the one-to-rest SVM\n(OVR-SVM). The main goal of SVM is to ﬁnd the hyperplane\nwhich can separate the two types of PD samples accurately\nand has the largest interval of classiﬁcation in the PD sample\nspace. The SVM classiﬁer can obtain good statistical laws\nwith a small number of PD samples and has a high classi-\nﬁcation accuracy in the test sample set, and also has good\nadaptability to the sample set.\nThree OVR-SVM classiﬁers are constructed to realize the\nmulti-class classiﬁcation. Each classiﬁer sets one of the three\ntypes of PD samples as positive class and the other two\nas negative class. Taking tip discharge in two-dimensional\nfeature space as an example to illustrate the OVR-SVM. The\ntip discharge is set to be in a positive class, and the surface\ndischarge and air discharge are set to be in the negative class.\nAs shown in Fig.9, when the training samples are input\ninto the OVR-SVM classiﬁer, the SVM classiﬁer will ﬁnd the\nclass boundaries between the positive and negative classes.\nWhen the test samples are input to the classiﬁer, the samples\nwill be identiﬁed by three classiﬁers in turn and the discrimi-\nnant function of each classiﬁer will calculate a function value.\nIf only one classiﬁer outputs a positive value, the result can be\ndirectly judged as the positive class in the corresponding clas-\nsiﬁer. Otherwise, the class corresponding to the maximum\nvalue (the highest conﬁdence) of the discriminant function\nis selected as the ﬁnal type of the test samples.\nAccording to the analysis in Sections II and III, the optimal\nangle-offset parameter θ is determined and the GLCMOP\ncorresponding to the PRPD grayscale images are calculated.\nOn this basis, a six-dimensional feature space of PD sam-\nples is constructed after the distinguishability screening and\nVOLUME 9, 2021 102429\nS.

The training sample set is used for the classiﬁer\ntraining and the test sample set is input into the SVM classi-\nﬁer for the PD pattern recognition. Finally, the classiﬁcation\nresult is output. The ﬂow chart of GLCMOP-SVM pattern\nrecognition is shown in Fig.10.\nIV. EXPERIMENT RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nBased on the test platform illustrated in Section II, 270 PD\nsamples are generated for the three types of PD. 190 PD\nsamples are used as the training sample set for the PD pat-\ntern recognition, and the rest 80 PD samples are used as\nthe test samples set. To evaluate quantitatively the inﬂuence\nof the GLCMOP algorithm on the classiﬁer, the training\ntime, and the number of support vectors (SVs) of the SVM\nclassiﬁer in GLCM-SVM and GLCMOP-SVM are calcu-\nlated and compared in Table 3. At the same time, the per-\nformance of GLCMOP-SVM with other pattern recognition\nmethods are also compared in the aspects of recognition time,\nmemory consumption, and recognition accuracy as shown in\nTable 4 and Table 5.\nThe results in Table 3 show that the training time of\nGLCMOP-SVM is shortened. Because the feature distin-\nguishability screening process can derive a low dimension\nTABLE 4. Comparison of recognition time and memory consumption.\nTABLE 5. Comparison of recognition results.\nand high distinguishability feature space, which speeds up the\ntraining process of the classiﬁer. The processes of determin-\ning the optimal angle-offset parameter θ and calculating the\nGLCMOP corresponding to the PRPD greyscale images can\nincrease the number of support vectors (SVs) in the PD sam-\nples. And thus, the class boundaries of different types of PD\nsamples are much clearer than before, which is beneﬁcial to\nimprove the generalization ability and recognition accuracy\nof the classiﬁer.\nIt can be seen from Table 4 that the GLCMOP-SVM\noutperforms the ANN, GLCM-XGBoost, and GLCM-SVM\nin terms of recognition time and memory consumption. This\nis because after calculating the GLCMOP corresponding to\nthe PRPD maps, we do not need to calculate the GLCM\ncorresponding to other values of the angle-offset parameter\nθ. In addition, the recognition speed can be improved and the\nmemory consumption of the classiﬁer can be reduced due to\nthe distinguishability screening and dimensionality reduction\nof PD feature space.\nAccording to Table 5, the recognition accuracies of\nGLCMOP-SVM for the tip discharge, surface discharge,\nand air discharge are 91.3%, 97.5%, 95.0% respectively,\nand the overall average recognition rate is 94.6%. And\nGLCMOP-SVM has higher recognition accuracy for each\ntype of PD compared with the ANN and GLCM-SVM,\nand the total average recognition rate is about 7% higher.\nIn summary, compared with the traditional classiﬁcation\nmethods, such as GLCM-SVM, XGBoost, and ANN, the\nGLCMOP-SVM has a faster recognition speed and higher\naccuracies.\nV. CONCLUSION\nA transformer PD pattern recognition algorithm based on the\nGLCM of optimal parameters and SVM (GLCMOP-SVM) is\nproposed in this paper. The main contributions of this paper\nare summarized as follows.\n102430 VOLUME 9, 2021\nS. Sunet al.: PD Pattern Recognition of Transformers Based on GLCM of Optimal Parameters\n(1) The algorithm can adaptively determine the corre-\nsponding GLCMOP according to the measured PRPD\ndata, and the characteristics of PRPD maps can be\nextracted and reﬂected by the GLCMOP as much as\npossible.\n(2) The processes of determining the GLCMOP and fea-\nture distinguishability screening lower the dimension\nand improve the distinguishability of the feature space.\n(3) The total recognition rate of the algorithm is as high as\n94.6%, which is about 7% higher than the traditional\npattern recognition algorithm. Moreover, the training\nand recognition time of the algorithm can be greatly\nreduced.\nTherefore, the algorithm is suitable for the on-line moni-\ntoring of transformers PD due to its high recognition speed\nand accuracy, and the proposed method can be used in small\nmobile devices or integrated systems.\nREFERENCES\n[1] C.
