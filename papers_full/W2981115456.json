    "abstract": "Transformer is one of main components in electrical power system which role to increase or reduce voltage. Characteristics of transformer would be vital to ensure the voltage is fully transferred. A single-phase transformer is a type of power transformer that utilizes single-phase alternating current, meaning the transformer relies on a voltage cycle that operates in a unified time phase. This article describes a workflow executed with Mat lab simulation and practical measurements for single-phase power transformer, no-load, short-circuit test and load test are achieved in this work. The test procedures are implemented on areal transformer (terco-type) which has a specification (1 KVA, 220/110 V, 50 Hz). Finally, the simulation results are appeared a proximately seminar from the practical results. The results indicated that the the technique and manner which presented in the current study can be depended as a miniproject in electrical technology mater for undergraduate studies.",
