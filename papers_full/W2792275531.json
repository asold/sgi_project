Introduction \nThis paper is an extension of the results disseminated in the \ninternational conference paper relating to the development of risk \nindicator for power transformers based on electrical measurements \n[1]. This risk indicator is  part of a condition indexing algorithm \nthat allows categorizing a large volume of technical data obtained \nduring operation and maintenance of a power transformer  into \ndiscrete risk categories. It provides information in a fast and \nsystematic way, so that transformers can be easily compared and \ncritical ones can be selected for further investigation.  \nThe main goal of this extended  paper is to present an algorithm \nfor determining the numerical value of the indicator based on \nresults of electrical measurements ( EM indicator), as  well as for \nestablishing the numerical value of the indicator based on results \nof oil parameters analysiss. The outcome for both indicators is the \nrisk category derived on a scale from 1 (lowest risk) to 5 (highest \nrisk, outage expected or immediate action necessary). The \nproposed indicators correspond to diagnostic tests regularly \nperformed on power transformers in  Latvian transmission system. \nHowever, significant differences in the periodicity of oil checks \nand electrical measurements determined the disparate structure of \nboth algorithms and the mathematical methods selected. \nThe proposed indicators have been verified with 30 case \nstudies. Results of diagnostic tests both from  transformers that \nrequired repairing, and transformers in a normal operation \ncondition were used. The authors express their gratitude to the \nLatvian Transmission System Operator ( Augstsprieguma ti kls, \nJSC) for providing data for the case studies. \nDifferent approaches are applied to develop appropriate and \nefficient algorithms for technical condition index which includes \nsuch common power transformer parameters as oil characteristics, \ndissolved gas analysis and electrical measurements [2]. \nArtificial neural networks (ANN) and adaptive neuro- fuzzy \ninference system (ANFIS) models , for instance,  are no longer \nlimited just for diagnosing faults and aging of power transformers. \nASTESJ \nISSN: 2415-6698 \n*Corresponding Author:  Gints Poiss, Email: gints.poiss@edu.rtu.lv  \n \n \nAdvances in Science, Technology and Engineering Systems Journal Vol. 3, No. 1, 148-154 (2018) \nwww.astesj.com   \nSpecial issue on Advancement in Engineering Technology \nhttps://dx.doi.org/10.25046/aj030118  \n G. Poiss et al. / Advances in Science, Technology and Engineering Systems Journal Vol. 3, No. 1, 148-154 (2018) \nwww.astesj.com     149 \nThese models can also be used to quantify the general condition of \na power transformer [3], also as  synthetic risk assessment methods \n[4] and fuzzy logic [5]. \nThe different diagnostic tools and methods, periodicity and \npower system charchteristics  are actually driving the need to \ndevelop a unique, expert -made assessment models for a certain \npower system . The novelty of the algorithms for indicators \nintroduced in this paper is based on analysis of features specific to \nthe power system in Latvia such as large proportion of aged \ntransformers, low loading level, significant variation in oil \nvolumes, and statistics on typical faults. Proposed limits of \nparameters are verified with data from operation history. The \nalgorithms provide evaluation of the main constructive parts of a \npower transformer, and also the structure of indicator algorithms \nis planned as adjustable, if the amount of applied diagnostics tests \nis changed. \n2. Technical Condition Index as a Part of Risk Matrix \nConfigurations of the risk matrix proposed for Latvian power \nsystem within the framework of this research is shown in Figure 1, \nand can be effectively used to evaluate each power transformer in \nthe system, as well as to plan the maintenance or replacement of \naged units. Risk matrix is divided into 3 parts, where green \nindicates a low-risk with no concern, blue indicates a moderate risk \nregion or a transformer in a normal operation and technical \ncondition, whereas the red region indicates a need for immediate \naction. The greatest attention will be paid to 4 cases depicted in \nFigure 1, that fall in the high-risk region. \nIn Figure 1, the ordinate axis of the risk matrix, shows \noperation characteristics and  it is based on such important \nparameters as transformer age, load, maintenance history, the \nexistence of monitoring system, importance in the system (as \nadditional option).  Three indicators are used to determine the \ntechnical condition index. Together with scoring and weighting \nfactors it is depicted as a value on abscise axis of the risk matrix. \nParameters used to determine the technical condition index are \ngiven in Table 1 and they correspond to diagnostic tests regularly \nperformed on power transformers in Latvian transmission system. \nThe algorithm of the indicator based on dissolved gas analysis \n(DGA) is provided in [6]. It is based on assessment of 7 key gases \nshown in Table 1 and includes analysis of features specific to the \npower system in Latvia where power transformers are aged and \nvariations in oil volumes are significant. Transformer loading, \noperation of the on-load tap changer (OLTC), and oil treatment are \nalso taken into account in order to quantify this indicator. \n \nFigure 1. Proposed configuration of risk matrix \nThe indicator based on electrical measurements for technical \ncondition indexing of a power transformer is developed by \nevaluating separately 3 main parts of a power transformer : \nwindings, bushings and OLTC. A failure of any of these parts may \nbe critical for a power transformer , the surrounding equipment,  \nenvironment and even se rvice personnel. The indicator based on  \nanalysis of oil parameters  such as flash point, dissipation factor, \nacidity and moisture content is developed as a combined approach \nof binary and fuzzy logic which allows evaluating the risk on basis \nof several oil parameters as a single entity. \nBoth indicators are described in detail in the following chapters of \nthis article. \nTable 1.

Development of Electrical Measurement Indicator \n3.1. Winding and core \nPower factor, insulation resistance and short-circuit impedance \nallow verifying the technical condition of transformer windings, \nwhereas variations in no -load losses reflect the condition of a \ntransformer core. \n A flowchart of a multi -step algorithm is shown in Figure 2. \nwhere scoring system for windings and core as a part of the EM \nindicator is derived on a scale from T=1 (lowest risk) to T=5 \n(highest risk, outage expected).  \nThe first step is input of measured parameter values from  test \nreports: insulation resistance (Rm), power factor (PF), short-circuit \nimpedance (Z k), no -load losses  (P0), and winding temperature \nreadings from a thermometer on a transformer.  \nNext step is data processing. As a reference point, it requires \ndata from the factory test report for a particular power transformer, \nas well as background information such as age, rated voltage, etc. \nThis information is stored in a specific technical file that is \nprepared for each transformer in the system. This file is also used \nfor other condition indexing indicators. Since the technical file \ncontains limits for the evaluation of parameters shown in Table 2, \nmodifications are restricted. \n\n G. Poiss et al. / Advances in Science, Technology and Engineering Systems Journal Vol. 3, No. 1, 148-154 (2018) \nwww.astesj.com     150 \nDuring data processing the input data are modified into a \nsuitable form for further analysis. PF values from the test report \nare calculated at base temperature of 20  ̊C. Thus the limits \nproposed in Table 2 and stored in the technical file can be applied \nfor risk evaluation (E1 indicates low risk, and E5 – high risk). PF \nlimits are based on recommendations provided in the standard \nIEEE C57.152- 2013. On basis of maintenance experience, \nadditionally value for level E5 were specified. PF=1.5% at 20 ̊C is \nan effective parameter for detecting high risk since moisture and \ncontamination of windings in this case in practice proved to be too \nhigh for reliable operation . Another parameter used for high risk \ndetection is the D t coefficient. It is a ratio between the measured \nresistance and rated voltage of high voltage winding (R m/Un). \nCoefficient Dt=1MΩ/kV at base temperature of 20  ̊C is set as the \nminimum insulation resistance limit [7]. For further ana lysis, \nvalues from the factory test report R fact adjusted to base \ntemperature are used as reference to evaluate if the decrease of \nmeasured Rm is acceptable. \nLimits for evaluation of short -circuit impedance Zk are based \non [8] and given in Table 2. Two val ues of Z k between phases \nshould be within E4 of each other. Lager deviation can indicate on \nmechanical deformation of windings.  A single-phase connection \nno-load losses P0 measurement is a test that has been historically \nused for evaluating the magnetic system of power transformers in \nLatvia. A specific feature is that different test voltage is used \n(either 220V or 380V). It causes difficulties if evaluation is based \non traditional comparative analysis to a factory test. In order to   \nuse results of a single measurement in this algorithm, limits based \non statistical data and recommendations of [9] and performed \nstudy of measurement history of no -load losses from  100 \ntransformers [1]. \n3.2. Bushings \nElectrical measurement results can provide information about \ndegradation of bushing insulation and help to avoid potential \nfailures, such as bushing explosion and transformer winding \ndeformation. Flowchart for bushing assessment is given in Figure \n3, and evaluation process is similar to the windings assessment \ndescribed before. Although a 3-level scoring system is proposed as \nmore suitable for bushings as more polarizing. It starts with \nevaluation of results of PF measurements for bushings by applying \nrespective limits from Table 2. for data from test reports are used \nfor input. The input is followed by the next step – data processing \nwhere all data are modified in a suitable form just like in the \nalgorithm for windings and the core part. \nTable 2.

OLTC \nThe static resistance measurement (SRM) is an important tool \nin this industry and it is used to check for loose connections, \nbroken strands, as well as high contact resistance in tap changer. \nFor decades, SRM is performed for each tap in the tap changer for \nall power transformers in Latvia and the experience is significant. \nTherefore SRM is included in the OLTC algorithm as the \nexclusion rule which can only indicate if the risk is low or high. \n G. Poiss et al. / Advances in Science, Technology and Engineering Systems Journal Vol. 3, No. 1, 148-154 (2018) \nwww.astesj.com     151 \nFor input in Figure 4, SRMs of all phases and all taps are assessed \nwithout the factory test report results; therefore the technical file is \nnot needed.   \nIn accordance with [11], the agreement with limit E5 indicates \non high risk and it is an important signal to consider the need to \nrepair tap changer immediately. If the SRM difference between \nphases is within the limit E1, it indicates on low risk. If resistance \nin 3 taps exceeds the limit E1, it should be investigated and TC=4 \nis assigned. \nDynamic resistance measurement (DRM) allows detecting \ndefects caused by contact coking, contact wear, oil -film layer \ndeposition, deviating transition times, contact timing problems, \nmaintenance errors and damaged transition resistors.

The algorithm of EM indicator for OLTC \n4. Development of Oil Indicator \n4.1. General description of oil indicator algorithm \nGenerally mineral transformer oil is used in power \ntransformers in power system of Latvia. Regularly measured oil \nparameter are dielectric strength, moisture content, acidity, \ndielectric dissipation factor, interfacial tension, viscosity, flash \npoint, and sludge content. Method for assessment of the \nmeasurement results described in the national standard involves \ncomparison of data obtained in laboratory with the given \nassessments limits, and conclusions are obtained for each oil \nparameter separately rather than as a single entity. The standard \ndoes not provide guidance on how to obtain one conclusion based \non multiple contradicting input parameters. \nFuzzy logic is widely applied for dissolved gas analysis (DGA) \nof power transformers [1 3, 1 4] since DGA contai ns relatively \nmany input parameters. If binary logic is used a contradiction can \noccur, where some of the input parameters correspond with a good \ncondition but others with a bad condition. Fuzzy logic can provide \nmore detailed assessment of technical condi tion. For example, \nfuzzy logic based algorithm with acidity and interfacial tension of \noil as input parameters is used to estimate remnant life of a power \ntransformer [15]. Similar approach of data processing is described \nin [16] in which remaining service  life of transformer in years is \npredicted based values of viscosity, resistivity, particle count, \nacidity and moisture content of oil.  Another research [17] shows \nthe possibility to combine measured values of moisture and acidity \nof oil, and the power factor of the winding to determine the type of \ntransformer defect based on the physical and chemical condition \nof insulation in cases with contradicting input data values. \nTherefore within the framework of this research fuzzy logic as \ndata processing method i s used to develop a technical condition \nindicator for a power transformer based on measurement results of \noil parameters. Four independent oil parameters (flash point, \ndissipation factor, acidity and moisture content) and additional \nparameter (changes in f lash point value in two subsequent \nmeasurements) are used as input data as shown in Figure 5. Limits \nshown in Table 3 are based on typical values observed for \ntransformers installed in transmission network in Latvia. As a \nresult, algorithm calculates the v alue of transformer oil indicator \nwithin limits from K=1 – (low risk) to K=5 (high risk, immediate \nactions required). \nFlash point  (FP) is the lowest temperature at which oil in \ncertain conditions releases such amount of vapour that, together \nwith air, crea tes a flammable mixture leading to fire hazard. \nTherefore, this parameter  is proposed for indicating high risk.  \nBased on practical experience in decision-making for transformer \nrepairs dissipation factor (tanδ) is proposed as another parameter \nindicating high risk since it is sensitive to oil aging, moisture, as \nwell as changes in contamination levels.  \nTable 3. Proposed Limits for Oil Parameters \nFlash point, oC Upper \nlimit \nAcidity, \nmgKOH/g \nMoisture \ncontent, \nppm \nTanδ, % \n125 or ≥Δ5 in 2 \nsubseqent \nmeasurements \nLevel 1 <0.05 <5 <1 \nLevel 2 ≤0.075 ≤10 ≤2.5 \nLevel 3 >0.1 >15 >4 \n \n \nFigure 5. Overall flowchart of oil indicator algorithm \n\n G. Poiss et al. / Advances in Science, Technology and Engineering Systems Journal Vol. 3, No. 1, 148-154 (2018) \nwww.astesj.com     152 \nDissipation factor tanδ along with acidity and moisture content \nare proposed as criteria for medium risk evaluation. In order to \nreach a unified conclusion regarding the correlation between these \nindependent oil parameters, the use of fuzzy logic is suggested. \nThe operation of the algorithm begins with  reading the  input \nparameters, namely results from the most recent oil measurement \nwhich then are stored in technical file that is prepared for each \ntransformer in the system for possible repetitive usage. If any of \nthe necessary oil parameters have not been measured  in this  \nparticular testing , the algorithm assumes the value  of that \nparameter as in Level 2 (see in Table 3).  \nIf the value of the parameter is repeatedly unknown, the \napproximation is performed in a logarithmic scale as shown in \nFigure 6  where approximated value aims for the Level 3, yet \ncannot reach it, since the difference from the maximum boundary \nis halved per iteration. \n \nFigure 6. Assumed values for unknown parameter value \nNext step of the proposed algorithm is the evaluation of \nexclusion cases indicating high risk (either flash point or changes \nin value of flashpoint or dissipation factor exceeds the limits of \nLevel 3) or low risk (values of dissipation factor and moisture and \nacidity are all below limits of Level 1). Fuzzy logic calculation \nblock activates if neither of the exception cases checks included in \nthe algorithm is positive.  \n4.2. Fuzzification \nDeveloped shape and slope for membership functions used \nwithin fuzzy logic calculation block of proposed algorithm is \nshown in Figure 7 originally, the selection of membership function \nshape and slope was carried out for each of the three oil  \nparameters. Illustration of membership function for tanδ is shown \nin Figure 8. The triangle and trapeze forms were tested for M \n(medium risk) membership function, whereas slope was altered for \nL (low risk) and H (high risk) membership functions. All variations \nwere tested by using the results of oil tests for 10 transformers with \ngiven maintenance history and different technical condition.  \n \nResults show that output values are not affected by the shape \nof M membership function, however, in some cases  value changes \nwere observed by alteration of the slope of L and H membership \nfunctions. After evaluation it was concluded that the combination \nof increased H membership function effect has the best correlation \nwith technical condition based on maintenance history.  \n \nFigure 7. Membership functions of oil indicator \nFor obtaining corresponding output values, a rulebox is created \nas shown in Table 4.  It contains all possible combinations. \nAltogether, there are 27 combinations, since for each of the 3 input \nparameters used in the fuzzy logic block 3 membership functions \nare assigned. The specific weight value is the minimum of all three \nmembership values for a given combination. The specific weights \nare summed together for each result value and thus a fuzzified \noutput is obtained. Afterwards, the gravitation centre of this output \nfunction is calculated. The obtained result is more precise, as more \npoints are used for the calculation.  \n4.3. Fuzzy inference and defuzzification \nAn example is illustrated in Figure 7 with following values of \noil parameters as input data from regular oil sample test of a \nparticular 110 kV transformer: flash point, 139\noC;  changes in flash \npoint value between two subsequent measurements, 2 oC; \ndissipation factor tanδ, 2 .17%; acidity, 0. 12mgKOH/g; moisture \ncontent, 10 ppm. Since exception cases included in the algorithm \nare negative in this case fuzzy logic calculation block activates. \n \nTable 4.

The specific weight is calculated as 0.5. \nThis proces s is repeated for each matching  combination. The \ngravitation centre of this output function is calculated , as well as \nthe position of gravity centre on x axis is estimated  as shown in \nFigure 9. The third of the position of gravity centre is the result and \nfinal output, in this case K=4 for oil indicator is obtained, which  \nindicates a  rather high operation risk. \na)    \nb)  \nFigure 8.

Estimation of output value \n5. Verification of EM and Oil Indicator \nResults of measurements within a time period of 8 years for 30 \npower transformers are used to verify both indicators and see how \nthey complement each other . It has to be noted that the power \ntransformer park in Latvia is aged and power transformers installed \nbetween 1967 and 2000 were used for verification with different \ntechnical condition, repairing plans and failure rate.  Figure 10 \nshows numerical values of EM and oil indicator obtained for the \nlatest available measurement set of each transformer. Since \npolarized score is used omitting the values 2 and 4 for bushings \nand 2 and 3 for OLTC the combined score 3 &4 is allocated in a \nseparate column. Mainly a numerical value of 1 was assigned to \nparameters OLTC and bushings which reflects tim ely scheduled \nrepairs. In those two cases where score value of 5 is assigned for \nbushings immediate decisions to replace them have been made by \nsystem operator. Similarly OLTC is repaired immediately if there1 \nis a variation from normal operation or a problem is detected.  \n \nFigure 10. Numerical values of indicator parameters of 30 power transformers \nValues 2 and 3 are obtained most frequently for oil analysis \nmost showed result 2 and 3, which indicates either normal \noperation or marks out necessity for small maintenance works such \nas the change of silicagel in a thermosyphon.  In two cases when \nscore of 4 for winding and core is assigned result dramatic decrease \nof winding isolation resistance and increase of power factor \ntherefore obtained results concise well with operation history. \nFor further analysis 4 cases from 30 were selected to illustrate \nhow indicators together reveal the technical condition of a power \ntransformer. Cases 1 to 3, plotted in Figure 11,  depicts the latest \nmeasurements available for three different transformers. Case 2 \nreflects a transformer in an almost perfect technical condition. But \nin case 1, problems with OLTC can be noticed  and analysis of \nmeasurement history revealed increased static resistance in 3 taps. \nCase 3 reveals bushing defect, caused by decreased insulation \nresistance in scheme C2 and increased power factor in scheme C1.  \n \nFigure 11. Case studies results \nSince electrical measurements are performed on average once \nin four years EM indicator is more static.  Case 4, plotted in    \nFigure 12 , illustrates the role of the oil indicator as the first \nimplication of a possible fault in a transformer since its results are \nmore dynamic. It can be observed that technical condition of this \nparticular transformer has decreased  due to increase in moisture \nlevel over the years.  \n \nFigure 12.

Conclusions \nLiterature review leads to a conclusion that methods for risk \nassessment of power transformers are mainly based on the results \nof performed diagnostic measurements  and operation history. \nSince maintenance strategy  may vary  over the time  and may \ndepend on decisions by a particular transmission system operator \nthe development of a modified risk matrix is a common global \npractice. \nConfiguration of risk matrix for power transformers in Latvian \ntransmission network proposed within the framework of this \nresearch is com posed of three regions indicating low risk, \nmoderate risk and high risk the last one requiring immediate \naction. The place of a transformer within the risk matrix depends \non its technical condition index (x -axis) and such parameters of \noperational history as transformer age, load, maintenance history, \nimportance in the system (y- axis). Technical condition index is \nestablished by calculating the numerical values of the three \nindicators and applying a scoring and weighting factor.  \nTo determine numerical values o f the indicator based on oil \nanalysis combined approach of binary and fuzzy logic proved to \nbe successful since it allows evaluating risk based on several oil \nparameters as a single entity. Results from a verification confirm \nthat higher output value s are shown by transformers that have \nalready attracted attention in practice. As oil analysis is done quite \noften, changes in values of this indicator are  first indication of a \npossible defect in a transformer and they substantiate the necessity \nfor further testing. However, an  indicator based on results of \nelectrical measurements more effectively serves to detect faulty \nconstructive parts more effectively and can be used as a  basis for \ndecisions on replacement of a bushing or repairs of an OLTC. \nAcknowledgment \nThis paper has been partly supported by the State Research \nProgram „LATENERGI”. \nConflict of Interest  \nThe authors declare no conflict of interest. \nReferences \n[1] G.
