Numerous studies have contributed to the \ncurrent understanding of the interconnected events that \noccur at the molecular level concerning aging and \nlongevity. Several directions have been extensively \nexplored in this area from investigating telomere \nattrition, dysfuncti onal signaling pathways related to \nproteostasis, mTORC1 resistance, cellular and genomic \ninstability [2] to identifying biomarkers, genetic \nvariations, and the impact of distinct cell and tissue \nsenescence on the age -related changes [3].

We \ntrained a domain-specific BioGPT model on a large corpus of biomedical literature consisting of grant text \nand developed a pipeline for generating target prediction. Our study demonstrates that pre-training of the \nLLM model with task-specific texts improves its performance. Applying the developed pipeline, we retrieved \nprospective aging and age-related disease targets and showed that these proteins are in correspondence \nwith the database data. Moreover, we propose CCR5 and PTH as potential novel dual-purpose anti-aging and \ndisease targets which were not previously identified as age-related but were highly ranked in our approach. \nOverall, our work highlights the high potential of transformer models in novel target prediction and provides \na roadmap for future integration of AI approaches for addressing the intricate challenges presented in the \nbiomedical field. \nwww.aging-us.com 9294 AGING \nThe application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has \ndemonstrated promising success in numerous areas of \nbiomedical research [5]. AI algorithms in drug \ndiscovery have revolutionized the field by significantly \nreducing the time and resources required to identify and \ndevelop new therapeutic compounds [6 –8]. Recent \nadvances in AI have expanded its use in aging research, \na field that investigates the complex multifaceted \nmechanisms associated  with the aging process [9]. \nParticularly, AI algorithms were successfully applied in \nthe establishment of deep aging clocks that incorporate \ndeep learning techniques to analyze a wide range of \nmolecular and physiological changes that occur during \nthe agin g process [10 –12]. Furthermore, AI has been \nsuccessfully applied to predict age -related biological \nmarkers which are critical in the development of novel \ninterventions to delay or reverse aging and its associated \nconditions [13 –15]. This growing body of re search \nhighlights the transformative potential of AI and LLMs \nin the realm of aging and biomedical research, offering \npromising perspectives in the development of novel \nstrategies to promote healthy aging and combat age -\nrelated diseases [6]. \n \nOne of the key developments in AI is the emergence of \nlarge-scale language models (LLMs), which are \npowerful machine learning algorithms trained on vast \namounts of text data to understand and generate \nlanguage. These LLMs have been widely employed in \ndiverse scientif ic disciplines, including biology and \ngenomics, to enable sophisticated text -based analyses \nand predictions [16,  17]. Although the use of LLMs in \nthe biomedical field still has not been comprehensively \nshown, we hypothesized that laden with the capacity to  \nrecognize intricate dependencies contained in vast \nvolumes of scientific text, LLMs could present a \npowerful technique for age-centric research.  \n \nOne of the important challenges for LLMs’ efficient \nusage is incipient approaches for the information \nretrieval from LLMs. Furthermore, since LLMs suffer \nfrom interpretability issues, it has been challenging to \ntranslate their predictive power into biologically \nmeaningful insights  [18]. Therefore, it is crucial to \ndevelop new methods that can effectively address  the \nchallenges associated with information extraction from \nLLMs and contribute to the understanding of complex \nbiological networks and processes. Considering the \nlimitations of the information retrieval from LLMs, we \naimed to tackle this task in the appli cation to target \ndiscovery within the framework of aging. We first \ndevised a pipeline for information extraction from \nLLMs based on the estimation of the probability of the \nnext token given the prompt. We applied this pipeline \nfor the ranking of proteins a ccording to their \nrelationships with 14 age -related diseases and aging. \nBesides the task of target discovery as in our case, the \nproposed method could provide the basis in any task \nimplying the ranking of the given list of subjects. We \nalso showed that LLM  pre-training with task -specific \ntexts significantly impacts the overall model \nperformance. Finally, we demonstrate the LLM -based \napproach is powerful in the identification of novel age -\nrelated targets, which were not previously reported by \nthe standard ta rget discovery techniques. Ultimately, \nour findings could provide the solid basis for further \nstudy of the efficient usage of LLMs in the domain -\nspecific tasks. The presented pipeline proposed a new \napproach for target discovery and provides new insights \ninto complex molecular mechanisms underlying \npathologies and potential therapeutic strategies. Overall, \nour findings emphasize the importance of adopting \ndata-driven approaches for identifying potential \ntherapeutic targets and provide a roadmap for future \nresearch in the field. \n \nRESULTS \n \nThe next token retrieval allows efficient information \nextraction from LLM \n \nLLMs hold significant potential for biologically -related \napplications, although efficient extraction of the \nrelevant information is a known obstacle for extended \napplication of the models [19]. Most of the LLMs \npublished recently are trained on the continuation of the \ntext when the next word is chosen based on the context -\naware words’ probability distribution learned from \npreviously shown context [20].  Thus, the prediction of \nthe next word given the prompt could be the promising \nmethods for LLM -based information extraction in the \ntask of ranging the list of known subjects. A medically \nimportant task with a matching objective is the target \nprioritization for a given disease. In this work, we \nproposed a pipeline for target discovery based on the \nLLM-retrieved probability of the gene to be the next \nword in the disease-related context.  \n \nThe general pipeline included the construction of the \ndisease-related p rompt, retrieval probability of several \ntokens continued from the initial prompt and the \ncalculation of genes probability (Figure 1A). The main \nmodel used for the study was the BioGPT -based model \nthat comprises the basic BioGPT with additional pre -\ntraining with more than 900K grants. BioGPT is a pre -\ntrained transformer specifically developed for \nbiomedical text generation and mining [21]. We \nhypothesized that additional training of the model with \nsubject-related data distinguishable from the initial \ntraining data content allows the increase of model \nperformance. Initial BioGPT was trained on the \nPubMed full text papers and abstracts that comprise \nwww.aging-us.com 9295 AGING \narticles, which are related to various domains of Life \nSciences and not Biology specifically. Therefore,  \nwe inte nded to train the model with the data more \nrelevant to target discovery for its further usage in  \ntarget prediction tasks. We selected the internal \nInsilicoMedicine comprehensive dataset of grant \nproposals as they often contain detailed description of \ntarget mechanisms of action in the specific disease in \ncontrast to PubMed paper that comprise general \ninformation along with pharmaceutically related texts.  \n \nWe utilized the BERTopic model [22] for the \nidentification of the prevalent topic within PubMed and \ngrant texts. First, the results have indicated that topics \nare indeed different between these two text corpus. \nMoreover, the topics identified for grant proposals have \nappeared to be more relevant for target discovery \n(Figure 1B, 1C). The 20 main topics ide ntified for \ngrants were closely related to human health and specific \nconditions or organs (topics 0 -4, 8, 10 -12, 14 -15, 17, \n18) or health in general (topics 5 - 7, 9, 16, 19, 20). In \ncontrast, topics of PubMed text were more hetero -\ngeneous. Also, along wit h the human -related \ninformation, there were articles devoted to animal \nstudies (topics 3, 8, 21) and other fields of Life Science \n(topics 1). Altogether, training on grants, which is both \ndistinct from the initial data corpus and contains target -\nrelated in formation, could be the promising approach \nfor the model performance in the target discovery task.  \n \nWe next optimized the prompt to make it suitable for \nthe selected task of the next word prediction. Prompts \nwere constructed in a way to increase the probability of \nthe next word to be the abbreviation of the human gene. \nThe efficiency of the prompt was estimated based on \nthe number of genes found in the top 1K words ranged \non the probability. The final prompt used for the task is \nas the following: “human gene targeted by a drug for \ntreating {DISEASE} is the”. Notably, the increase in \nthe prompt length negatively influenced the outcome\n \n \n \nFigure 1 . The main method utilized in the work.  (A) The general pipeline of the work. ( B) Predominant topics for the grant and  \n(C) PubMed texts identified by BertTopic. (D) Distribution of token lengths for protein-coding genes. (E) The number of unique tokens placed \nin the noted positions within the gene name.  \n\nwww.aging-us.com 9296 AGING \nwhile the addition of an article (i.e. “the” or “a”) at the \nend of the prompt had the opposite effect.  \n \nOne of the major parts of the pipeline development was \nto establish the procedure for the gene name probability \nestimation. We utilized the general tokenizer provided \nby Microsoft for BioGPT that contains only a part of the \ngene's names in the vocabulary. Thus, most of the genes \nare coded with 2 to 7 tokens, while only less than 2% of \nthe genes are directly found in the vocabulary (Figure \n1D, 1E). Thus, to estimate the probability of the gene \nname with several tokens, the tokens were iteratively \nadded to th e initial prompt for the calculation of the \nnext token probability (Figure 2). The total probability \nof the gene was calculated as the multiplication of its \ntokens probabilities.  \n \nTo account for the different token number in the g ene \nname, we applied various normalization procedures and \nvalidated their effectiveness through internal testing. \nWe identified two steps where the normalization could \nbe applied, specifically, to the individual tokens on each \niteration and the final product of the probabilities for all \ngene tokens. As only a small number of tokens \ncorresponds to the gene names, we first tested \nindividual tokens normalization at each step. Aiming to \naddress the lowering of probabilities due to the \nprevalence of tokens not r elated to genes, we divided \neach token probability by the sum of probabilities of \ngene tokens (Figure 3A, “Total sum”). Also, we tested \nand considered the two approaches where genes \nfinished in selected iteration (with the total token length \nequals to the round number) and continued genes (with \nthe total token length exceeding the round number) \nseparately (Figure 3A, “Separate sum”). According to \nthe validation metrics, the normalization of the \nindividual tokens in each iteration that resulted in the \nsum of all gene tokens equals to 1 has shown the best \nperformance (Figure 3C). We next proceeded with  \nthe normalization of the final product of tokens \nprobabilities. As the multiplication of several \nprobabilities impaired the results for genes with longer \nnames, we first applied approaches to correct for \nmultiplication impact (Figure 3C, “Total sum ** 1 / \nlength”). Additionally, we tested the approaches for \ndecreasing the probability of genes with longer names, \nas we hypothesized that normalization procedure \napplied to each individual token could lead to \noverestimation of its value. Indeed, we observed the \nincrease in metrics for the approach with the division of \nthe final probability by the length of tokens within the \ngene name (Figure 3C, “2. Final probabilitie s \nnormalization according to the number of tokens in a \ngene name”). Notably, the increase was observed in all \ntested combinations independent of the individual \ntokens normalization method. Additionally, we attempted \n \n \n \nFigure 2. Overview of the established approach of the retrieval of the next token probability using BioGPT model. \n\nwww.aging-us.com 9297 AGING \nto identify the best parameter for final normalization. \nThe results suggested that parameter does not \nsignificantly affect the performance, however parameter \nequals to 1 yields slightly better results (Figure 3C, “3. \nVariation of the parameter for the fina l normalization”). \nFinally, we also observed that name lengths of known \ntargets are distributed differently from all genes in total: \nonly genes with names of 1 to 5 tokens are presented \n(Figure 3B). This observation is in line with the \nconstruction of the vocabulary for BioGPT that the most \ncommon genes, which are abundant in the training text \ndatasets, appeared in the vocabulary as they frequently \nencountered. Thus, we also applied approaches for \nfiltering out genes with the name length longer than 5 \ntokens. This cut -off was selected as no longer than this \nvalue was observed for known targets. \n \nThe results have shown that the model that involved the \nfull list of genes, normalization to 1 on each interaction, \nand the normalization of the final product by the  \ndivision of the name length outperforms other model \nversions. Altogether, we have shown that identification \nof word probabilities with LLMs should be carefully \nconsidered due to the limitation of the vocabulary size \nand identified the possible ways for no rmalization. \nLastly, we have shown that the constructed pipeline \nallows efficient task -specific information extraction \nfrom LLM specifically used for the target discovery \ntask. \n \nTraining of BioGPT with the relevant to target \ndiscovery information increase the performance of \nthe model \n \nThe established pipeline was used to estimate the \nperformance of several modifications of BioGPT \nmodels to check if the training with additional data \ncould improve the task -specific performance. Our ma in \nfocus was on the initial BioGPT and the one trained \nwith grants (BioGPT -G), but we also included two \nversions of BioGPT Large with increased parameter \nsize: the basic one and the one trained with PubMedQA\n \n \n \nFigure 3.

Based on the validation metrics, \ntraining with additional relevant data promotes an \nincrease in performance in target discovery tasks \n(Figure 4B). It was observed for both grants information \nand PubMedQA dataset. The general increase of \nBioGPT Large  performance could be connected with \nthe high parameters number.  \n \nNotably, the increase in performance was more \npronounced for training with grants information \ncompared with the PubMedQA. As PubMedQA dataset \ncomprised only the short answers “yes/no/maybe” to \nbiomedical questions that could be highly overlapped \nwith PubMe d abstract information [23], the grant \nabstracts could be more efficient for training and \nconsequent model usage in target discovery. Altogether, \npre-training of the established model with data that \nwould be both different from the training set and \nrelevant to the selected domain could be a powerful \nmethod for the task-specific model optimization. \n \nBioGPT-trained on grants is a powerful model in \ntargets discovery \n \nWe next used a proposed approach for information \nretrieval with BioGP T-G to rank genes according to \ntheir association with aging. The top 200 entries \n(Supplementary Table 1) were selected for further \ninvestigation. Initially, we checked the intersection of \nthis list with known age-related genes obtained from the \nGenAge database [24]. We have observed a significant \noverlap with 47 out of 200 genes appearing to have a \nknown association with aging ( p < 0.001; Figure 5A). \nFor the comparison, we retrieved the genes that are \nmost commonly mentioned in the context of aging in \nPubMed though calculating the number of abstracts \n \n \n \nFigure 4.

Their intersection with th e GenAge \ndatabase comprised 15 genes ( p < 0.001; Figure 5B). \nAdditionally, we also performed Gene Ontology (GO) \nenrichment analysis for the top 50 genes ranked by \nBioGPT-G and observed the significant results ( FDR \nadjusted p < 0.01 ) for 575 categories (Fig ure 5C  and \nSupplementary Table 2). Notably, most of the top ranked \ncategories express the evidence for the association  \nwith aging. Specifically, cellular processes related to \nmetabolism, stress response, and kinase cascades are \ndescribed as age -related in recent publications [25–27]. \nAltogether, the results suggest that the usage of LLMs \ncould be more efficient in context -specific tasks \ncompared with the traditional target discovery methods.  \n \nWe next aimed to gain more insights into the difference \nbetween the gene ranking with LLM and context search \nin PubMed. As standard ways of LLMs’ explainability \nmethods are not established, we decided to focus on the \ninvestigation of protein embeddings. For that, we \nobtained protein representations with BioGPT  \nand co nstructed the graph with vertex weights corres -\nponding to cosine similarities between protein nodes. \nWe hypothesized that during the training, BioGPT \nlearns not only the probabilities of the words in the \nspecific context, but also creates the internal \nassociations of word similarities. Thus, we expected to \nsee that nodes corresponding to the proteins, which are \nnot highly mentioned with “aging” in PubMed texts but \nselected as age -related by BioGPT, should be placed \nclosely on the graph to the proteins both co-mentioned \nwith “aging” and selected as age -related by BioGPT \n(Figure 5D). As the measurement of the proximity, we \nselected the shortest path length. According to the \nresults, the nodes of the proteins that were solely \nselected by BioGPT indeed lay signi ficantly closer in \nthe latent space compared with other nodes (Figure 5E). \nThus, we proposed that along with efficient context -\nspecific search the usage of LLMs allows leveraging \nmore complex associations unavailable for other \nmethods.  \n \nPotential dual -purpose target discovery for aging \nand multiple age-related diseases \n \nTo proceed with the identification of the dual -purpose \ndisease and age-related targets, we first retrieved the list\n \n \n \nFigure 5.

We then intersected the obtained lists with the \nresults for the age-related genes search. According to the \nresults, there were 9 genes common for all of 14 diseases \nand aging, specifically VHL, EGF, PTH, RET, BRCA1, \nSRC, CCR5, MIP, TNF (Figure 6B).  \n \nTo investigate the  novelty of the 9 obtained genes i.e., \nBRCA1, CCR5, EGF, MIP, PTH, RET, SRC, TNF, and \nVHL (Table 1), we have obtained additional data on the \nage-related targets including clinical trials and targets of \ndrugs with anti-aging effect.  \n \nAmong these 9 genes, C CR5, MIP, and PTH are \nconsidered as novel age -related targets because their \nroles in aging were not reported previously based on the \ndatabases for experimentally validated age-related genes \nand compounds (DrugAge, GenAge, Geroproectors and \nSynergyage) as well as clinical trials data. Despite this, \nMIP is a candidate tumor suppressor, while BRCA1 and \nVHL are known tumor suppressors [29, 30]. The high \nscoring of tumor suppressors as associated with age and \nage-related diseases by our approach is in line with \nprevious findings, which further suggested that tumor \nsuppressor genes could be linked to aging [28]. \nHowever, targeting these tumor suppressors could be \nattributed to the increased risks of cancer development \n[31]. Thus, considering targets’ mechanisms of  action \naccording to the literature review, we propose three \nknown age-related genes, TNF, SRC and RET, and two \nnovel genes, CCR5 and PTH, as potential dual -purpose \ncandidates for aging and age-related diseases. \n \nEvidence suggested that TNF-α/IFN-γ synergy amplifies \nsenescence-associated inflammation and that TNF -α \nantagonism can rescue the effect of aging on stroke [32, \n33]. Moreover, dasatinib targeting SRC was considered \nas a senolytic used to remove senescent cells [34]. \nFurthermore, RET has been demons trated to exhibit \nincreased expression with age in rats [35]. RET binds to \nglial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and \nother ligands to promote cell survival and proliferation \nvia the PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK pathways [36]. In \nhumans, RET is suggested to be associated with diverse \nsubtypes of thyroid cancers [37]. Taken together, TNF, \nSRC and RET antagonisms are potential therapeutic \napproaches for aging and age-related diseases.  \n \nCCR5 is a co-receptor with CD4 for HIV infe ction, and \nthe receptor for several inflammatory CC -chemokines, \ni.e., CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5, to subsequently activate \nAKT and NF -kB signaling pathways [38, 39]. It is \npredominantly expressed on the cell membrane of \nmacrophages and T cells [40]. Given its cl ose \nconnection with chemokines, CCR5 coordinates \nimmune cell differentiation and migrations, as well as \npromotes inflammation [41–43]. Pathologically, besides \nHIV, it has been implicated in cancer [44] and other \ninflammatory disorders, such as inflammatory  bowel \ndisease [45] and rheumatoid arthritis [46].

Furthermore, CCR5 has been \nfound to promote neuroinflammation, therefore \ninhibiting it can provide neuroprotective benefits [49]. \nAdditionally, studies have shown that CCR5 can \naccelerate the development of Alzheimer's disease [50 ]. \nCenicriviroc, which is a dual antagonist of CCR5 and \nCCR2, has been found to be effective in slowing the \nprogression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [51] and \nreducing liver damage in rodents with cholestasis [52]. \nTherefore, CCR5 antagonism is a promising therapeutic \napproach for aging and age-related diseases.  \n \nParathyroid hormone, encoded by PTH gene, maintains \nextracellular calcium and phosphorus homeostasis and \nfacilitates renal vitamin D synthesis. PTH is synthesized \nin the parathyroid glands, and exerts its function in  \nthe kidneys, bones, and small intestine [53]. \nMechanistically, upon the d rop of extracellular calcium \nlevel, PTH stimulates calcium absorption in the small \nintestine and kidney, promotes renal phosphate \nexcretion, and enhances bone resorption to increase \ncalcium release in order to resume normal serum \ncalcium level [54]. Serum levels of PTH were found to \nincrease with age in humans [55] and are linked to age -\nrelated syndromes such as frailty [56], osteoporosis \n[57], and sarcopenia [58]. PTH administration in rats \nimpairs energy production, transfer, and utilization in \nskeletal muscles [59], suggesting that PTH antagonism \nmay be a potential therapeutic approach for aging and \naging-related conditions.  \n \nIn addition, considering their mechanisms of action and \ndruggability, GDNF, NGF, BDNF, CXCR4, MYC and \nTH, being the top 200 aging targets that occur in more \nthan 10 age -related diseases identified by BioGPT -G, \nwere also considered as potential dual-purpose candidates. \n \nDISCUSSION \n \nThe advance in the natural language domain has \npermitted the development of LLMs, which have proven \nto exhibit remarkable performance in various complex \ntasks [60]. Despite the constant development of new \nmodels, the methods required for efficient informat ion \nextraction from these models remains insufficiently \nunderstood. The lack of such approaches impedes the full \npotential of LLMs and significantly limits their \napplicability, especially in the domain -specific tasks. \nTherefore, our objective was to establish an approach for \ninformation retrieval from LLMs that can be applied to \nrank a given list of subjects. Specifically, we focused on \nthe target prediction for the selected disease, which is \namong the most critical challenges in the biomedical \nfield. We de monstrated that a ranked list could be \ngenerated from LLM through iterative calculation of the \nnext token probability. Moreover, we have shown viable \napproaches to address the probability calculation for \nwords containing more than one token. Our results \ndemonstrated the high performance of the pipeline in \ntarget prediction, suggesting the potential of applying this \nmethod in the similar tasks of biomedical and other \nfields.  \n \nAmong the various general language models available, \nthere exist multiple pre-trained field-specific LLMs that \nare trained on in-domain data. One of the major sources \nof data for training biology -related LLMs is PubMed, \nwww.aging-us.com 9302 AGING \nwhich contains abstract and full texts of papers in Life \nSciences [61]. We hypothesized that information used \nfor trai ning of domain -specific models may not be \nprecise enough to allow the model to be efficiently used \nin narrow topics within this domain. Indeed, an analysis \nof the PubMed abstracts revealed that along with \ninformation on human health, this source contains \narticles related to other species and non -biological \ntopics. Thus, we trained the BioGPT model [21], \ninitially pre -trained by Microsoft on 15M PubMed \nabstracts, with an additional dataset containing texts \nrelevant to target discovery. We assumed that resear ch \nprojects from National Institutes of Health (“grants”) \ncould be useful for pre -training since biomedical grants \ndescriptions mostly focus on drugs' impact on human \nhealth. Our results showed that training with grants \ncould indeed enhance the performance of BioGPT in the \ntarget discovery task. Although training with grant texts \nwas sufficient to show the model improvement, we \nsuggest that larger and more comprehensive datasets or \ntheir combination could have a more significant impact \non model performance. Also, we initially chose BioGPT \nfor our work as a model with fewer parameters due to \ncomputational costs. We suggest that usage of BioGPT -\nLarge trained on grants or other relevant data distinct \nfrom PubMed could additionally increase the \nperformance in th e target discovery task. Overall, we \npropose the potential benefits of an additional LLM \nmodel training on texts relevant to the selected task for \nimproved downstream performance. \n \nIn this work, we focused on the application of the \nestablished pipeline to the identification of the potential \ntargets related to aging, which is considered one of the \nmost important risk factors for mortality. For that, we \nstudied target prediction results for 14 age -related \ndiseases and aging itself to identify the potential du al-\npurpose targets that are connected with both aging and \nmultiple age-related diseases. We have also undertaken \nthe task of providing a simple approach that could \nenhance the interpretability of BioGPT output by \napplication of graph -based methods on nodes  retrieved \nwith protein embeddings. As explanation of LLMs \nbehavior poses a known challenge [62], and only a \nlimited number of approaches have been proposed, we \nsuggest that investigating embeddings could serve as a \nstraightforward yet promising approach t owards a \ngeneralized explanation of LLMs result. Our initial \nfindings indicate that the application of the pipeline \nyielded biologically meaningful results as some of the \nproposed genes were previously described in the \nliterature as age-related or related to the specific disease, \nrespectively. Moreover, the analysis of the genes most \nfrequently selected both as related to aging and age -\nrelated disease by the model allows to identify the \npotential novel dual targets. Finally, we propose CCR5 \nand PTH as novel  dual-purpose disease and age -related \ntargets based on the comprehensive analysis including \nthe evidence of participation in age-related cell pathways, \ndruggability, known therapeutics mechanisms of action.  \n \nIt is worth noting that our pipeline applicatio n is not \nlimited to target selection. The ranking of a given list of \nsubjects is a common biomedical task that involves \nrevealing associations between biological terms such as \ngenes, diseases, processes, drugs, etc. In addition to \nresearch purposes, this a pproach could assist medical \ndoctors in conducting systematic reviews more \nefficiently by ranking relevant articles based on the \nselected topic. Furthermore, our pipeline can assist in \nranking any subjects, even when a strict ranking \ncriterion is not defin ed and a comprehensive under -\nstanding of large text corpuses is required. Therefore, \nwe anticipate that our approach will have a wide range \nof potential applications in various areas, even beyond \nthe biomedical field. \n \nDespite the potential benefits of the  proposed approach \nfor target selection, there are several limitations to \nconsider. As discussed in the paper, the comprehensive \nexplainability of LLMs is still lacking. This makes it \ndifficult to accurately assess the ability of LLM -based \napproaches to id entify complex associations between \ngenes and diseases. As a result, the identification of \npotential novel targets may be impeded, especially when \nthere is restricted availability of various types of \ninformation such as scientific papers, grants, known \ntherapeutics on the selected protein. Additionally, while \nthe pipeline demonstrated high performance in target \nprediction, our validation was limited to only 14 age -\nrelated diseases. Therefore, it may be necessary to \nconduct more generalized performance estim ation for a \nbroader range of diseases and experimental validation of \nthe predicted targets in order to obtain a more accurate \nestimation of the effectiveness of the proposed approach. \nDespite these limitations, our work demonstrates that pre-\ntrained LLMs, integrated within a structured information \nextraction pipeline, can exhibit significant efficacy in \nperforming complex tasks specific to a given domain. \nThese results could provide a strong foundation for \nfurther investigations in this field. \n \nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n \nData collection and disease selection \n \nThe list of genes was downloaded from The HUGO Gene \nNomenclature Committee (HGNC) website [63] and \nfiltered by the type. The final list of genes comprised \n19,333 gene symbols and standard names. The genes most \ncommonly co -mentioned with “aging” in PubMed \nabstracts were identified with BioPython [64]. The list of \nwww.aging-us.com 9303 AGING \ngenes was ranked and top 200 genes by the co -mentions \nwere selected. Also, the list of genes with the highest \nmention in the context of aging was retrieved. For that, we \ndivided the number of publications where gene and \n“aging” were co -mentioned to the total number of \npublications mentioning the gene. This normalization was \nperformed to account for the gene total prevalence within \nPubMed texts. Genes targeted by the investigated drugs \nthat entered clinical trials with either aging or healthy \naging as one of the disease conditions were obtained from \nthe ClinicalTrials.gov. The list of genes that are targeted \nby compounds with anti-ageing properties were obtained \nby mapping of compounds found in DrugAge [65] and \nGeroprotector [66] databases to their known targets.  \n \nWe downloaded around 900 thousand National \nInstitutes of Health ( https://report.nih.gov/) research \nprojects, which obtained funding (“grants”). We \nproposed that funding for research is a good marker of \nvaluable projects which contain valuable domain -\nspecific knowledge. In this study we used abstracts of \ngrants as texts for language model pretraining. \n \nIn addition, we obtained a random subset of 100 \nthousand PubMed ( https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) \narticle abstracts to analyze the common top ics of this \ndata source in comparison to grants topics. \n \nFor target identification in age -related diseases, a list of \n14 previously published diseases according to the study \nof Pun et al.  [28] was extracted. These diseases were \nselected based on their characteristics of having age as a \nstrong risk factor for the disease’s onset.  \n \nText topic identification \n \nRandom sample of 100 thousand publications was \nselected from the PubMed abstracts and grant texts for \nthe following analysis. First, embeddings were retrieved \nwith “all -mpnet-base-v2” sentence -transformers model \n[67]. Next, texts were pre-filtered by the removal of the \nstopwords with NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) [68] \nand conversion to lowercase format. Prepared PubMed \nand grant texts and their embeddings were used for the \nidentification of the prevalent latent topics with \nBERTopic [22]. The minimum number of sentences per \ntopic was set to 15. Identified dense clusters were \nvisualized with the “visualize_documents” function. \n \nBioGPT-G training  \n \nWe initially took a BioGPT model with 347 million \nparameters which is based on GPT -2 [69] medium size \nand pre -trained on 15 million PubMed abstracts. The \ntraining objective of this model is standard language \nmodeling task, which aims to maximize log -likelihood \nof a next token given the context (def 1): \n \n21\n( ),\nM\nttt\ndef 1: maximize log p y y\n=\n\n \n \nwhere \n() ttp y y  is a conditional probability, M is a \nnumber of words in a context. \n \nTo enrich the biomedical knowledge base of the chosen \nBioGPT model, we additionally pretrained it on more \nthan 900 thousand grant abstracts by optimizing the \nsame o bjective as for GPT -2 [69]. The pre -training \nlasted for around 40 hours with a train batch size of 16 \nand gradient accumulation steps of 64 per device on \nfour A5000 GPUs. For the optimization, we used Adam \nalgorithm [70] with 100 warm -up steps and learning  \nrate 5e-5. The original BioGPT tokenizer was used with \nthe max length of input texts equal to 250 tokens with \ntruncation, the distribution of input text lengths depicted \nin Figure 7A. We filtered out abstracts with less than 8 \n \n \n \nFigure 7. (A) Learning curves. (B) Grant lengths distribution.  \n\nwww.aging-us.com 9304 AGING \nwords total assuming that they don’t carry useful \ninformation. \n \nThe training procedure was defined to 5 epochs due to \ntime and computational resources limits, which is not \nenough for  full model convergence, but still close to \ntraining and evaluation losses plato (Figure 7B).  \n \nModel validation  \n \nThe sorted list of targets was produced for each model \ntype and the top-k validation method was implemented/ \nThe top-k gene list was evaluate d on the effect strength \nand effect significance based on the log fold change of \nenrichment (ELFC) and hypergeometric p-value \n(HGPV) scores respectively. ELFC estimates whether \nthe percentage of source nodes for a particular target \nnode has increased withi n the top -k relative to the total \npercentage of known source nodes associated with this \ntarget node. In the application to the current task, the \neffect strength estimates the percentage of ADRs that \nwere scored in top -k to a specific drug and, similarly, \nthe percentage of drugs that were scored in top -k to a \nspecific protein. ELFC was calculated by the following \nformula:  \n \n( ) 2 , k\nN\ntargets NELFC score log k targets\n =  \n \n \nwhere targetsk was the number of known targets for this \ndisease in top-k (or 0.1 if there were none), and targetsN \nwas the total number of known targets for this disease.  \n \nAlong with the effect strength, its significance was \nestimated based on the top -k hypergeometric test. \nHGPV score was calculated based on the following \nformula: \n \n( )( ) 10 1 ( , , , ) , kNHGPV score log hgcdf targets k targets N=− −\n \nwhere hgcdf is a hypergeometric cumulative \ndistribution function. P-values indicate the probability \nof drawing targets -k or more known targets in k draws \nfrom a set of N genes with targets -N known targets. \nThus, HGPV score represents -log10 of such p-values \nfor each target node. Higher values of ELFC and HGPV \ncorresponded to the higher predictive power of the \nprotein-ADR association. \n \nProtein representation retrieval and graph \nconstruction \n \nTo get proteins representations, the input text containing \nthe prompt “The human age-associated gene is the” and \nthe name of one of th e genes was first tokenized and \nconverted to PyTorch tensor [71] Then, token \nembeddings were computed with the following mean \noutput pooling. The resulting vectors with the length of \n1024 corresponding to the individual proteins were used \nfor the analysis.  The similarity between the proteins \nwere represented as cosine similarities between the \nembeddings, which were further used as vertices for the \nweighted graph.  \n \nThe weighted undirected graphs were constructed with \nNetworkX software [72]. First, the links  between the \nproteins were filtered based on the cosine similarity cut-\noff equals to 0.507 or the upper quartile of the cosine \nsimilarities distribution. Then, the shortest path was \ncalculated using Dijkstra’s algorithm. As the source nodes \nthe nodes corre sponding to the proteins both co -\nmentioned in PubMed abstracts with “aging” and selected \nas associated with aging by BioGPT. For the targets, the \nnodes corresponding to the proteins selected as associated \nwith aging by BioGPT but not co-mentioned in PubMed \nabstracts and random proteins nodes for the main \nexperiment and control were selected, respectively. \n \nAbbreviations \n \nAI: Artificial Intelligence; GO: Gene Ontology; HGNC: \nHUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee; iPSC: Induced \npluripotent stem cell; LLM: Large la nguage model; \nNLTK: Natural Language Toolkit. \n \nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS \n \nDZ – developing of  the described approach and \nmanuscript writing, SP - model training, data analysis, \nmanuscript writing, GL - data curation and manuscript \nreviewing, BL - targets selecti on and manuscript \nreviewing, AU and DS - conceptualization and results \ninterpretation, EK - BERTopic application and \nvisualization, AK - data curation, VN - project \nadministration and conceptualization, FR - \nconceptualization, supervision, IO and AA - supervision, \nAZ – conceptualization, resources, supervision.
