Accidental damage of high-voltage \npower transformers is accompanied by significant \neconomic damage and in some cases can have serious \nconsequences [1]. Given the significant ageing of high-\nvoltage power transformers in Ukraine and in most \nforeign countries, as well as the extremely low rate of \nequipment replacement that has reached the end of its life, \nensuring the operational reliab ility of transformers is an \nimportant scientific and practical task. One of the \nelements of insulation of high-voltage power transformers \nis petroleum insulating oils. As shown in [2, 3], the \ncondition of transformer oils has a significant role in \nensuring the operational reliability of transformers. Oil \noxidation products have a negative effect not only on the \nelectrical strength of the liquid insulation, but also \ncontribute to a reduction in the mechanical strength of the \ncellulose insulation, which leads to a reduction in the \ntransformer service life. In this regard, the improvement \nof methods for assessing the condition of transformer oils \nis an urgent task. The solution of this problem will \nincrease the operational reliability of high-voltage power \ntransformers and extend their service life. \nPublication analysis and research problem \nstatement. At present, a great deal of research is devoted \nISSN 2074-272X. Electrical Engineering & Electromechanics, 2021, no. 5 47 \nto the improvement of methods for diagnosing the \ncondition of transformer oils. Improvement is carried out \nin two main directions – the use of new methods of \nmeasurement (for example, [4-8]) and improvement of \ndecision-making methods. For example, in [9-12] neural \nnetworks of different configurations are proposed to \ndiagnose the condition and predict the values of \ntransformer oil indicators. In [13, 14], oil condition \nassessment was performed using Markov networks. In \n[15, 16] fuzzy logic was applied, and in [17-19] \nregression models were used. Considering that under real \noperating conditions the condition of oils is evaluated by \ncomparing the measured values of indicators with \nmaximum permissible values (MPV), which are regulated \nby international or national standards [20, 21], in [22-24] \na correction of MPV indicator s of transformer oils was \nperformed. However, in these studies, integral distribution \nfunctions were used to correct MPV, and the laws \nthemselves were not analysed. At the same time, as \nshown in [25, 26], the use of statistical decision methods, \ntaking into account the distribution laws of diagnostic \nindicators to correct MPV allo ws to significantly reduce \nthe risks compared to the meth od of integral functions. In \naddition, the parameters of distribution laws are widely \nused in the development of models for predicting the \nresidual life of equipment,  e.g. [27]. Meanwhile, the \nanalysis showed that the analysis of distribution laws of \ntransformer oil indicators has not found sufficient \ncoverage in the literature. An exception is the research \ncarried out in [28] according to which oil indicators such \nas organic acid content (OAC), breakdown voltage \n(BDV), interfacial tension, oil resistivity and water \ncontent can be described by a Weibull distribution. \nHowever, the differences in the values of the oil \ndistribution parameters obtained before filling and aged \noils are insignificant, which requires further verification. \nTherefore, this paper presents the results of the analysis of \ndistribution laws for the whole set of transformer oil \nparameters in the tanks of 110 kV transformers and \n330 kV autotransformers. \nStatistical processing of periodic test results.  The \nresults of periodic transformer oil BDV monitoring for the \n231 transformers of 110 kV and 49 autotransformers of \n330 kV were used as input data. The total volume of the \nanalysed sample amounted to 21062 values, of which \n17408 were obtained for 110 kV transformers, while 3654 \nwere obtained for 330 kV autotransformers. The list of \ntransformer oil indicators an d the volume of sample \nvalues for each indicator are shown in Table 1. \nThe sample presented in Table 1 is heterogeneous \nboth in terms of the number of transformers and of the \ntotal number of indicator values. This heterogeneity is due \nto several factors. For exampl e, for such indicator as the \ntransformer oil colour, the current Ukrainian standard [21] \nregulates the maximum permissible values only for new \noil, and for in-service cont rol such values are not \nregulated, but must be taken into account when assessing \nthe condition of oils. This circumstance is one of the \nreasons that the oil colour is monitored not in all power \ncompanies in Ukraine. Insignificant amounts of sampling \nvalues for such indicators as water-soluble acids, \nmechanical impurities and wa ter content are because the \ncurrent standards allowed the use of several methods to \ndetermine the values of these indicators: indicative \n(absent or present) and quantitative (determined \nquantitative content of these indicators in mg KOH/g or \ng/t). Since the diagnosis «absent» using indicator methods \nis not equivalent to zero, only the results of quantitative \nmethods were used for further analysis. \nTable 1 \nList of indicators for transformer oils and volume \nof sample values for each indicator \nVolume of sample values \nNo. Oil quality indicator Number of \ntransformers \nNumber of \nvalues \n110 kV transformers \n1 Flash point 230 3746 \n2 Acid number 231 3741 \n3 BDV 231 3723 \n4 tg at 20 С 31 268 \n5 tg at 70 С 50 426 \n6 tg at 90 С 60 570 \n7 Oil colour 121 2108 \n8 Water-soluble acid content 46 1191 \n9 Water content 73 1635 \n330 kV autotransformers \n1 Flash point 49 887 \n2 Acid number 48 850 \n3 BDV 49 852 \n4 tg at 90 С 45 543 \n5 Water content 30 400 \n6 Contamination content 20 122 \n \nSince the test results were obtained in different \nlaboratories and the transforme rs analysed have different \nservice lives, are operated w ith different loads and are \nfilled with different oil types,  it is obvious that the oil \nageing intensity in the anal ysed transformers varies \nconsiderably. In other words, the raw data is statistically \nheterogeneous. As an example, Fig. 1, a shows the \ndielectric dissipation factor of  transformer oils measured \nat 90 °C for 330 kV autotransformers. The heterogeneity \nof the raw data in the figure is due to both differences in \nthe quality of the oil filled (relatively high values of tg δ \nmeasured at 90 °C at the start of operation) and \ndifferences in operating cond itions (low values of this \nindicator were obtained with a fairly long service life). In \naddition, there are errors in the test results. The \nheterogeneity of the raw data leads to the empirical \ndistribution histogram distortion (Fig. 1, b), which does \nnot allow an evaluation of the distribution laws for \ntransformer oils. \nIn this regard, there is a task of forming \nhomogeneous arrays of transformer oil indicators. At the \nfirst stage, from the initial data set were selected values of \nindicators that go beyond the area of MPV, regulated by \nthe current normative document in Ukraine [21]. Using \nbasic terms from the theory of  technical diagnostics [29], \ndenote the data set, consisting of the results of tests for an \noil usable by the values of indicators as D\n1. Data set \nconsisting of test results for unusable oil as D2. \n48 ISSN 2074-272X. Electrical Engineering & Electromechanics, 2021, no. 5 \nTwo approaches are used to generate homogeneous \nindicator arrays. The first approach is based on the use of \nmathematical models of variance analysis and, as shown \nin [30, 31], allows obtaining sufficiently correct integral \ndistribution functions of diagnostic attributes. A \nsignificant limitation of this approach is the limited \ninformation about the operating modes of transformers, \nthe specifics of their design, the materials used. This may \ncause erroneous conclusions. The second approach is \nbased on the use of statistical  hypothesis tests and, as \nshown in [32], allows estimating the distribution laws of \ndiagnostic attributes. The disadvantage of this approach is \nthe difficulty in establishing the relationship between the \nparameters of the distribution laws of diagnostic \nindicators and the factors affecting the ageing intensity. \n \n0.01\n0.1\n1\n10\n100\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\nt,  year\ntg, at 90oC, %\n \na \n \nb \nFig. 1. Dependence of the dielectric dissipation factor of \ntransformer oils measured at 90 °C in 330 kV autotransformers \non the operating time for the original data set (a) and the \ncorresponding empirical distribution histogram (b) \n \nIt is known [33] that the main factors influencing the \nintensity of oil oxidation are temperature, air oxygen \ncontent, duration of oxidation and the influence of some \nstructural materials (copper, varnished insulating fabric, \nnot oil resistant rubber, etc.). Considering that the date of \noil filling is known for each of the transformers under \nconsideration, the duration of oil ageing is not very \ndifficult to account for. However, during long-term \noperation, the oil can be dried, regenerated, refilled or \nreplaced both oil and silica gel, which leads to a distortion \nof the performance dependence on the operating time. In \norder to eliminate this problem, the results of the periodic \ntests for such transformers were divided into several \ngroups (for example, from the time of oil filling and to the \nregeneration date and from the regeneration date to the \ndate of the last test) in a preliminary statistical processing \nstep. The insulation temperature of power transformers \n[34, 35] depends on both the value of load currents and \nthe ambient temperature, as well as on the transformer \ncooling system. The transformers under consideration are \noperated in the same climatic zone with similar values of \naverage daily temperatures, a nd have an identical cooling \nsystem (with oil natural and air forced for 110 kV \ntransformers, and with oil forced and air forced for \n330 kV autotransformers). Therefore, it is logical to \nassume that differences in oil oxidation intensity caused \nby different operating temper ature values, which are due \nto differences in load currents [36]. Under conditions \nwhere transformer load information is partially available, \na statistical hypothesis test approach was used to generate \nhomogeneous arrays of indicators. \nArrays with homogeneous periodic test results were \ngenerated by using three statistical criteria [32]: \n1. Wilcoxon rank-sum test  ( W) is used to test the \nstatistical hypothesis of similarity of distribution laws of \ntwo independent samples: \n \n ,\n1\n\n\n\nn\ni\nirsW  (1) \nwhere ri are the ranks of the diagnostic indicators in the \noverall variation series; s(ri) is one of the possible N! \npermutations of rank ri. \n2. Z-criterion ( Z) is used to test the statistical \nhypothesis of equality of mathematical expectations of \ntwo independent samples: \n ,\n2\n2\n2\n1\n21\nobs\nm\nδ\nn\nδ\nxxZ\n\n  (2) \nwhere ̅x1 and ̅x2 are the selective mean of the diagnostic \nindicator calculated from the first and second transformer \ntest results respectively; 2\n1δ  and 2\n2δ  are the selective \nvariance of the diagnostic indicator calculated from the \nfirst and second transformer test results respectively; \nn and m are the number of observations of the diagnostic \nindicator for the first and second transformer respectively. \n3. Fisher-Snedecor F distribution (F) is used to test the \nstatistical hypothesis of dispersions equality of two \nindependent samples: \n \n,2\nmin\n2\nmax\nobs\n\nF  (3) \nwhere 2\nmax  and 2\nmin  are the values of the maximum \nand minimum sampling variance. \nTwo independent samples were considered \nhomogeneous if the following statistical hypotheses were \nnot rejected by the test resu lts at the given significance \nlevel \n = 0.05: \n1. about similarity of distribution laws of two \nindependent samples (W1Wn1, n2, 0,025, W2Wn1, n2, 0,975); \nISSN 2074-272X. Electrical Engineering & Electromechanics, 2021, no. 5 49 \n2. about equality of mathematical expectations of two \nindependent samples (ZobsZcrit, 0,95); \n3. about dispersions equality of two independent \nsamples (FobsF(n1–1), (n2–1), 0,95). \nThe above algorithm for statistical processing of test \nresults was implemented as the author's software \n«Odnorodn» [37], which significantly reduces the time \nrequired for statistical processing of raw data. Using this \nsoftware in relation to the analysed data sample allowed \nforming several arrays of indicators with close values of \nsample means, sample variance and similar distribution \nlaws. The volume of sample values ( N), values of sample \nmean (M\nx), sample variance ( Dx) as well as skewness ( js) \nand kurtosis ( jk) coefficients for the original data sets \n(D10) and those obtained from statistical processing \n(D11-D1n) of usable oil indicators for 110 kV transformers \nare given in Table 2 and for 330 kV autotransformers in \nTable 3. \nComparison of statistical characteristics of initial \narrays of oil indicators with  similar characteristics of \nindicators from the arrays obtained after statistical \nprocessing showed that using statistical processing \nprocedure allowed significantly reducing the D\nx, as well \nas the js and jk for almost all indicators. Analysis of \nstatistical characteristics of  the arrays of indicators \nobtained through statistical processing shows that the \nvalues of mathematical expectation of the usable oil \nindicators differ significantly. This indicates both \ndifferent quality of transformer oil and different oil ageing \nintensity, that is, differences in transformer operation \nmodes. As can be seen from Tables, negative skewness \ncoefficients (the «long part» of the distribution curve is to \nthe left of the mathematical expectation) are obtained \nmainly for the indicators which decrease in value during \nageing (flash point and BDV). For the oil indicators \nwhich increase with oil ageing (organic and water-soluble \nacid content, tgδ, oil colour, water content, contamination \ncontent), the majority of the obtained arrays show positive \nskewness values («long part» of the distribution curve is \nto the right of the mathematical expectation). \nThe presence of a negative skewness for some of the \nindicator data sets indicates a deterioration in the \ncondition of the transformer oil; there are more «high \nvalues» of the indicators than  low ones. As can be seen \nfrom the tables, there is a positive kurtosis coefficient for \nall indicator arrays, indicating that the distribution curve \nhas a higher and «sharper» p eak than the curve of the \nnormal law. The obtained empirical values of skewness \nand kurtosis coefficients i ndirectly indicate that the \ndistribution of usable oil indicators may differ from the \nnormal law. \nThe analysis showed that the homogeneous arrays \nwere formed by testing transformers with close operating \ntimes and similar values of load factors. This made it \npossible to establish an unambiguous relationship \nbetween the operating conditions of the transformers and \nthe values of the distribution law parameters. \nThe processing of the results of periodic tests on \noils which have exceeded the MPV (unusable oil) was \ncarried out in the following sequence.

For this purpose, the Irwin criterion \nwas used, which can be applied when the distribution law \nof a random variable is unknown or differs from the \nnormal distribution. The values of the oil indicators were \nsorted in descending order for this purpose, after which \nthe «suspicious» values of the BDV at the boundaries of \nthe variation series were evaluated. The value of the Irwin \ncriterion was defined as: \n \n \n,prev\ncalc S\nxx kk \n  (4) \nwhere xk is the suspicious value; xk prev  is the previous \nvalue in the variation series. \nThe calculated value of the Irwin criterion was \ncompared with the table value ηtable. If ηcalc > ηtable, then \nthe considered value was rejected and the next value was \nchecked. The test was continued until ηcalc < ηtable. \nBy analogy with Tables 2 and 3, Table 4 shows the \nsame attributes for the data sets obtained during statistical \nprocessing of unusable oil values for 110 kV \ntransformers. In the table, array D\n21 is based on the results \nof transformers with less than 20 years of service life, and \narray D 22 is based on the results  of transformers with \nmore than 20 years of service life. \nTable 4 \nStatistical characteristics of homogeneous arrays of indicators \nof unusable oil \nArray N M x D x j s j k \n110 kV transformers \nOrganic acid content \nD21 303 0.177673 0.001155 –0.176 2.421 \nD22 141 0.283191 0.000225 –0.092 2.402 \nBDV \nD2 275 27.647 19.814 –0.653 3.083 \nWater–soluble acid content \nD2 192 0.035904 0.000154 0.550 3.040 \nWater content \nD2 164 36.333659 100.10887 0.505 3.097 \n330 kV autotransformer \nOrganic acid content \nD2 136 0.137456 0.000273 –0.0113 3.200 \nBDV \nD2 123 41.550894 4.880138 –0.666 2.875 \nWater content \nD2 132 29.287879 22.728261 –0.0120 2.237 \n \nBy comparing the statisti cal characteristics for the \nrespective indicators for usable and unusable oil, it can be \nseen that the main difference between them is the values \nof the sample means.\n  \nAnalysis of the distribut ion laws for transformer \noils. To test the hypothesis that the theoretical distribution \nlaw corresponds to empirical  data, the software «ZR» \ndeveloped at the Electric Power Transmission Department \nof National Technical University «Kharkiv Polytechnic \nInstitute» was used [37]. This software allows splitting \nthe range of variation of a random variable into intervals, \nfor which the Sturges′ rule is used by default: \n \nNL lg322,31  , (5) \nwhere N is the volume of sample values. \nIf necessary, the user can set the required number of \nintervals himself. A hist ogram of the empirical \ndistribution is then drawn. The parameters for the normal, \nbeta, exponential, extremal, gamma, Laplace, logistic, \nlogarithmic normal, Rayleigh, Weibull and Pareto \ndistribution laws are then estimated from the sample \nvalues. For each of the 11 distribution laws, the \ntheoretical distribution law is checked for consistency \nwith the empirical data, using two statistical criteria [38]: \nISSN 2074-272X.

The number of degrees of \nfreedom f is defined as f = k – 1 – r, where k is the number \nof sample groups (partial intervals); r is the number of \nestimated distribution parameters that are estimated from \nthe sample data. \nIf the calculated value of 2 criterion is less than the \ncritical value, the main hypothesis – the general \npopulation is distributed according to the given law – is \nnot rejected and vice versa. \n2) Kolmogorov-Smirnov test: \n \n)()(sup xFxFD n\nx\nn  , (7) \nwhere Fn(x) is the empirical distribution function; F(x) is \nthe theoretical distribution function. \nThe main hypothesis is rejected if nDn   exceeds \nthe distribution quantile K of the given significance \nlevel α, and is not rejected otherwise [38]. \nAnalysis by the software showed that both usable \nand unusable oil values could be described by a Weibull \ndistribution, with a distribution density as follows: \n \n\nβ\nα\nx\nβ\nβ ex\nα\nββx;α;p\n\n\n\n\n  1 , (8) \nwhere  and  are distribution law parameters, interpreted \nas scale and shape parameter, respectively. \nThe value of the α and β parameters was defined as: \n ;\n142701 91.β)(β.\nM(x)α \n   \n \n\n\n,\n70\n1\n2821\n1\n4650\n1\n2\n1\n1\n2\n2\n1\n1\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\nM(x)xN\nM(x).\nM(x)\nM(x)xN\n.\nN\nNβ\nN\ni\ni\nN\ni\ni\n  \nwhere N is the volume of sample values; Mx is the sample \nmean; xi is the indicator value. \nHowever, during the analysis, for some of the arrays \nthe main hypothesis was not rejected for several \ndistribution laws. Thus, for distributions with positive \nskewness, in addition to the Weibull distribution, the \nempirical data were fit to the log-normal, gamma and \nRayleigh distribution laws. \nAs an example, Fig. 2 shows histograms of the \nempirical distribution and the theoretical density functions \n \n \n \n \n \na \n \nb \n \nc \n \nd \nFig. 2.

However, for many arrays with negative skewness, \nthe only distribution law corresponding to the empirical \ndata was a Weibull distribution law. \nThe values of the Weibull distribution law \nparameters as well as the calculated and critical values of \nthe Pearson and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests for the \nindicators of usable oil in 110 kV transformers are given \nin Table 5 and for 330 kV autotransformers are given in \nTable 6. \nThe same, but for the unusable oil indicators are \ngiven in Table 7. For the tables below, the \ncrit value of \nthe Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is 1.36. \nAs can be seen from Tables 6, 7, the calculated \nvalues of the goodness of fit criteria for all transformer oil \nindicators without exception do not exceed the critical \nvalues at significance level α = 0.05 and the \ncorresponding value of degrees of freedom. This does not \nallow rejecting the hypothesis about the acceptability of \nthe distribution of empirical values of transformer oils to \nthe Weibull distribution. \nResults analysis. By analogy with [32], the analysis \nof the mutual arrangement of theoretical densities of \ndistribution of the indicators of usable and unusable \ntransformer oils in of 110 and 330 kV transformers was \ncarried out. As an example Figures 3-5 shows the \ndensities of theoretical distributions for such indicators as \nthe organic acid content (Fig. 3), water content (Fig. 4) \nand the BDV (Fig. 5) of the oil. \nAnalysing the mutual arrang ement of the theoretical \ndistribution densities of transformer oil indicators, several \nimportant conclusions can be drawn: \n1. For the usable transformer oil for both 110 kV \ntransformers and 330 kV autotransformers, there is a shift \nin the mathematical expectations of the distributions \ndensity for different arrays of the same indicator. This \nindicates a different oil ageing degree, which is caused by \ndifferent oil service life, di fferent operating temperatures \nof transformers as well as by the influence of structural \nmaterials. \n2. Analysis of the distribution densities of usable oil \nfor 110 kV transformers and 330 kV autotransformers \nshows that these distributions are also shifted in relation \nto each other. It is especially noticeable in the distribution \ndensities of organic acids (Fig. 3) and water content of \noils (Fig. 4). Thus, as can be seen from the figure the \noxidation intensity of transformer oils in 330 kV \nautotransformers is lower th an in 110 kV transformers, \ndespite the fact that the an alysed transformers were \nnon-sealed.\n \n3. The analysis shows that th ere is a significant shift \nbetween the mathematical  expectations of the \ndistributions of usable and unusable oil (Figures 3-5). \nThis means that the residual life of the oils in the \ntransformers analysed varies considerably. \n \n \nTable 5 \nValues of the Weibull distribution law parameters as well as the \ncalculated and critical values of the Pearson and Kolmogorov-\nSmirnov tests for the indicators of usable oil in 110 kV \ntransformers \nDistribution law \nparameters \nValue of Pearson's \nchi-squared test \nValue of \nKolmogorov-\nSmirnov test \nArray \n  f 2\ncalc 2\ncrit calc \nFlash point \nD11 140.96 104.9 3 7.47 7.82 0.711 \nD12 143.71 127.5 4 8.59 9.49 1.194 \nD13 145.54 96.44 3 7.47 7.82 0.338 \nD14 148.91 46.2 4 8.26 9.49 0.694 \nD15 150.69 59.57 3 6.27 7.82 1.044 \nOrganic acid content \nD11 0.0172 1.682 6 10.47 12.6 0.711 \nD12 0.0308 3.706 5 21.26 11.1 1.001 \nD13 0.0518 2.454 6 8.54 12.6 0.654 \nD14 0.0514 3.702 4 7.92 9.49 0.674 \nD15 0.0581 2.611 5 10.68 11.1 0.800 \nD16 0.0519 2.154 4 6.074 9.49 0.545 \nD17 0.0725 1.679 6 10.96 12.6 0.760 \nBDV \nD11 51.833 8.704 4 8.942 9.49 0.711 \nD12 64.963 6.596 7 12.03 14.1 0.607 \nD13 72.625 7.209 6 12.21 12.6 0.643 \nD14 73.726 7.84 5 6.419 11.1 0.606 \nD15 75.623 7.517 5 6.59 11.1 0.601 \ntg at 20 С \nD11 0.1576 1.515 4 9.439 9.49 1.017 \nD12 0.2103 1.569 4 9.095 9.49 0.639 \ntg at 70 С \nD11 0.3221 1.491 4 5.079 9.49 0.697 \nD12 0.6585 1.496 4 6.465 9.49 0.673 \nD13 0.9478 1.562 4 1.865 9.49 0.311 \ntg at 90 С \nD11 0.5327 1.379 3 2.296 7.82 0.329 \nD12 0.6101 1.526 3 1.173 7.82 0.275 \nD13 1.6593 1.432 3 4.737 7.82 0.734 \nD14 2.0442 1.383 3 2.764 7.82 0.383 \nOil colour \nD11 2.1334 2.631 3 6.794 7.82 0.690 \nD12 3.4054 1.772 4 8.456 9.49 0.739 \nD13 3.453 2.339 3 6.523 7.82 0.656 \nWater-soluble acid content \nD11 0.0049 1.986 2 2.765 5.99 0.449 \nD12 0.0062 2.365 6 6.383 12.6 0.446 \nD13 0.0071 2.207 4 1.468 9.49 0.288 \nD14 0.0078 2.554 4 3.736 9.49 0.378 \nD15 0.0086 3.112 3 2.277 7.82 0.344 \nWater content \nD11 8.9923 2.239 5 2.137 11.1 0.279 \nD12 10.478 2.176 7 10.06 14.1 0.552 \nD13 12.05 2.849 7 8.763 14.1 0.385 \n \nISSN 2074-272X.

Density functions of the theoretical distribution of the \nBDV in oil for 110 kV transformers (a) \nand 330 kV autotransformers (b) \n \nConclusions. \nThe analysis of the distribution laws of \ntransformer oils showed that for both usable and \nunusable oil the distribution of oil indicators could be \ndescribed by the Weibull distribution, which agrees \nwell with the results of previously published studies. In \nthe process of analysis, it was found that for the usable \ntransformer oil, both for 110 kV transformers and \n330 kV autotransformers there is a shift of \nmathematical expectations of the distribution density \nfor different arrays of th e same indicator. This \nindicates a different oil ageing degree which is caused \nby different oil service life, different operating \ntemperatures of transformers as well as by the \ninfluence of structural mate rials. During the analysis, it \nwas found that in 330 kV autotransformers the \noxidation reactions proceed  with less intensity \ncompared to 110 kV transformers. This is evidenced by \nthe presence of a shift between the distribution \ndensities of some indicators of usable oil in 110 kV \ntransformers and 330 kV autotransformers. It has been \nfound that there is a significant shift between the \nmathematical expectations of the distributions of \nusable and unsuitable oil. This means that the residual \nlife of oils in transfor mers analysed varies \nsignificantly. The obtained values of the parameters of \nthe distribution laws of transformer oil indicators can \nbe used in the development of models to estimate the \nservice life of oils, as well as to predict and plan the \ntiming of maintenance and repair of equipment, which \nwill allow to carry out the transition to maintenance \naccording to the real situati on rather than the calendar \nplan. In addition, the presence of distribution law \nparameter values for indicators of oil with different \nstates allow to estimate the state of transformer oils \nusing likelihood ratios, which can significantly reduce \nthe risks of making wrong decisions. \nConflict of interests.
