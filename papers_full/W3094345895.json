  "abstract": "The electronic voltage transformer (EVT) has received much attention with the recent global trend to establish smart grids and digital substations. One of the main issues of the EVT is the deterioration of its performance with long-term operation which affects the control and protection systems it is employed for and hence the overall reliability of the power grids. This calls for the essential need for a reliable technique to regularly assess the accuracy of operating EVT in real-time. Unfortunately, traditional calibration methods cannot detect the incipient EVT performance change in real-time. As such, this paper presents a new online method to evaluate the accuracy of the EVT. In this regard, the Q-statistic is calculated based on the recursive principal components analysis (RPCA) using the output data of EVT to map up the changes of metering error on the electric–physics relationship. By employing the output data of the EVT along with the power grid characteristics, the performance of the EVT is evaluated without the need for a standard transformer, as per the current industry practice. Results show that the proposed method can assess the EVT with a 0.2 accuracy class.",
