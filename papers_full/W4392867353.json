Particularly noteworthy is their role in developing models\nto comprehend sequential data, notably text. These breakthroughs have been a cornerstone of large language models\n(LLMs) known for their capability to perform a wide range of tasks without being explicitly programmed for them.\nThis architecture’s scalability and efficiency in capturing long-range dependencies led to the development of Generative\nPre-trained Transformer (GPT) models2. Due to their versatility, these LLMs are swiftly finding applications across\nmany sectors, with researchers actively exploring their potential within the electric energy sector. While research has\n∗Preprint to the paper accepted by Joule: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2024.05.009\n†Equal contribution as joint first co-authors\n‡The views expressed in this paper are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of MISO.\narXiv:2403.09125v5  [eess.SY]  20 Jun 2024\nshowcased their potential in tasks such as generating customized code3, utilizing retrieval augmented generation (RAG)\ncapabilities in answering technical questions3, power network data synthesis4, using deep reinforcement learning for\nin-context optimal power-flow solution5, concerns regarding data ownership6, privacy7, and safety guarantees8, have\nalso been raised.\nThe electric energy sector is the lifeblood of modern society. Power consumption not only serves as a barometer of\nsocietal behavior and prosperity but also underpins economic activities within the industrial and commercial sectors.\nDriven by the urgent imperative of global climate change and increasing electricity demand, the power industry is\nencountering an unprecedented volume of sensor integration, growing adoption of variable renewable resources such\nas solar and wind, and integration of newer technologies like hydrogen, electric vehicles, and large computing loads.\nCustomer expectations regarding the quality and reliability of electricity supply are also evolving. This expansion has\nled to an exponential increase in the volume of equipment/devices and associated data, posing significant challenges\nfor power system operators and utilities who must manage these complexities without a corresponding increase in the\nworkforce. The rapid accumulation of new knowledge and instantaneous data exceeds the human capacity to process it\nunaided. These developments are propelling the power system into a phase of transition, necessitating adaptations to\naccommodate these new technologies and mitigate their associated challenges.\nIn this landscape, LLMs offer promising value to the electric energy sector, thanks to their ability to interpret human\nprompts and alleviate sensory overload, especially providing near real-time guidance in managing extreme weather\nevents and risks associated with diverse sources of uncertainty. Therefore, it is important to demystify the capabilities\nand limitations of LLMs in performing realistic power-engineering tasks by themselves or delegate them via add-on\ncapabilities, if needed. In this vein, as shown in Figure 1, through rigorous testing and analysis utilizing a production-\ngrade LLM, specifically the GPT models, our study embarks on a comprehensive exploration of the capabilities of\nLLMs to scrutinize their readiness as an interface between human and electric energy systems. Further, we investigate\nhow to better facilitate the integration of LLMs in the new era, considering their potential limitations. Finally, we\ndiscuss future research opportunities in the electric energy sector.\nFigure 1: Capabilities and Limitations of Applying LLMs in the Electric Energy Sector.\n2 Capabilities of LLMs to Fill in the Gap\nIn this section, we explore the capabilities of LLMs in tackling power engineering challenges as exemplified in Figure 2\nbased on experiments provided in the Supplemental Information (contain Sections SI.1-8). Our research delves into the\naccuracy of LLMs in performing various electrical engineering domain-specific tasks, including power flow analysis,\n2\noptimal power flow analysis, forecasting, image and pattern recognition, and answering questions utilizing a custom\ndomain-specific knowledge base, among others. While our focus primarily revolves around the GPT model series,\nmost of our observations are relevant to other mainstream models. In this section, we expand on the four key strengths\nof LLMs, illustrated in Figure 1, and elaborate on how these four strengths translate into key LLM capabilities for\nperforming power engineering tasks.\n2.1 Language Models and In-weight Learning\nA foundational capability of LLMs is to produce semantically meaningful text outputs (responses) from text inputs\n(prompts). Though it is not clear what the pre-training datasets are, based on our investigation, current language models\nhave the capability to provide schematically logical responses for power engineering domain-specific questions (see\nSections SI.5). A major part of this capability may be a natural consequence of the large number of model parameters\nwhere certain information has been memorized. Then, the efficient processing in the transformer architecture allows\nefficient retrievals of such memorized information. This memorization and retrieval capability is sometimes referred\nto as in-weight learning. Foundational LLM models usually allow users to refine the model on a newer corpus of\ninformation through the ‘fine-tuning’ process9, which we have harnessed for load forecasting tasks as shown in Figure\n2(B) (see Section SI.6). This process allows the model parameters within the LLM to be changed.\nLLMs have profound implications for power systems, where LLMs can improve operational efficiency and support\ndecision-making processes within the power sector by facilitating interaction between power system data, software,\ntools, and cross-domain datasets. Leveraging their inference capabilities, LLMs can enable real-time diagnostics\n(Section SI.1), on-demand analysis, and augment traditional control center operations.\n2.2 Prompt Engineering and In-context Learning\nThe efficacy of LLMs in generating responses is significantly influenced by the structure and style of queries or\nprompts10, a practice commonly referred to as prompt engineering. Prompt engineering can help power engineers obtain\nmore meaningful responses on difficult problem-solving tasks, while naïve prompts usually fail to induce desirable\nresponses (Sections SI.2 and SI.4). Some of the most well-known techniques in this direction are chain-of-thoughts\nprompts and retrieval augmented generations (RAGs). As illustrated in Figure 2(D), LLMs can sift through documents\nwith large amounts of text information, which can be extremely useful in fast-paced work environments such as those in\npower system operations (Section SI.5.2).\nOne of the most surprising capabilities of LLMs observed in prompt engineering research is the emergent in-context\nlearning capability, based on a few example prompts, as demonstrated in Figure 2(A) (see Section SI.3). More precisely,\nLLMs appear to derive patterns or learn rules from the prompts without the underlying model going through any\nadditional changes and are then able to apply the learned patterns and rules from the prompts to produce correct\nresponses (also demonstrated in one of the load forecasting examples in Section SI.6). Even if the LLM’s performance\nmay not be the best in class, the ability to learn based on limited data can be extremely useful for power engineers,\ngiven that power system datasets are usually protected. LLM-generated responses are typically variable, and one can\nreduce the variability of LLM-generated responses by harnessing custom domain-specific knowledge as a part of prompt\nengineering.\n2.3 Enhanced Capability via Tool Embedding\nLLMs, by themselves, are complex language processing units; however, their capability could be enhanced by including\nfurther processing units. Tool embedding is one of such enhanced capabilities, where LLMs are trained to delegate\nsome of the tasks. For example, we have noted that GPT-4 prioritizes writing text files, executing codes utilizing the\nembedded tools, and inferring the generated results (as shown in the examples of Section SI.1, SI.2). As depicted in\nFigure 2(C), LLMs utilizes its tool embedding capability to extract regions with wildfire and superimpose on top of\ntransmission line infrastructure map to identify the transmission lines at risk (Section SI.2).\nThis tool embedding capability can be extremely powerful for the power system engineers, where many of the\napplications require solving non-linear non-convex problems. Power system engineers utilize physics-based modeling\nand simulation tools, such as PSS/E, PSCAD, PowerWorld, and CyME, which could be called upon by LLMs to\nsolve complex problems. This tool embedding capability could be facilitated by API-calling11. Tool embedding also\nfacilitates on-demand remote processing of typical spatiotemporal time series power system data (e.g., SCADA data)\n(see Section SI.1).\n3\n2.4 Enhanced Multi-modal Capabilities\nMany times, power engineers are expected to work with non-text and non-numeric data (see Sections SI.3 and SI.4),\nsuch as time-series measurements, images, or videos. Foundational LLMs can be combined with other models to obtain\nmulti-modal processing capabilities, enabling them to contextualize information presented in various non-text formats.\nSuch capabilities are primarily facilitated by semantic embeddings, which are similar to the embeddings commonly\nused in natural language processing. Consequently, large language models (LLMs) exhibit robust performance for\nmulti-modal data. Notably, state-of-the-art computer science literature are focusing on enhancing the capabilities of\nLLMs with multi-modal input and output. We anticipate that in the near future, multi-modal capabilities will be a native\npart of most off-the-shelf LLMs and that the next-generation applications will indeed exploit these capabilities. In our\nexperiments, LLMs demonstrate proficiency in interpreting image data. In this regard, as shown in Figure 2(A), LLMs\nutilize multi-modal capability in addition to their in-context learning ability to diagnose defects in the insulator images\n(see Section SI.3).\n01:00 06:00 12:00 18:00 24:00\nTime (Hour Ending)\nLoad (GW)\n40\n50\n60\n70\nTrue load\nForecast with LLM-suggested linear model (MAPE=19%) \nForecast with text embedding (MAPE = 15%)\nForecast with 'fine-tuned' LLM (MAPE=8%) \n(A) Insulator Defect Detection\n(B) Load Forecast\n(C) Wildfire Risk Recognition\n(D) Knowledge Pool Analysis using RAG\nFigure 2: Applications of LLMs in the Electric Energy Sector. This figure illustrates four distinct applications of LLMs\nin power systems. (A) Highlights the use of LLMs’ multi-modality and appropriate choice of prompts in insulator\ndefect detection from captured images. (B) Illustrates that fine-tuned language models through in-weight learning\nand further enhanced by prompt engineering techniques can be used for time-series forecasting. (C) Depicts LLMs’\ntool-embedding ability alongside prompt engineering can be employed to analyze wildfire patterns for risk assessments.\n(D) Demonstrates natural language processing strengths of LLMs and the use of RAG to generate precise responses to\ndocuments LLMs may not have seen before.\n4\n3 Limitations of LLMs for Applications in the Electric Energy Sector\n3.1 Challenges in Domain-Specific Data Availability and Processing\nA significant challenge in applying large language models (LLMs) within the power sector is the scarcity of domain-\nspecific data in the pre-training of LLMs. Due to privacy concerns and regulations, pre-training of LLMs can only rely\non publicly available and licensed third-party datasets12. Therefore, an open question for the research community is\nhow to construct large power system domain specific training datasets for LLMs overcoming Critical Energy/Electric\nInfrastructure Information (CEII) per section 215A(d) of the United States Federal Power Act13. Constrained by this\nreality, smaller curated high-quality (labeled) datasets can be used for fine-tuning; which, for example, can assist the\nuser in performing power flow analysis (Section SI.7), or even to prevent LLMs from generating unsafe responses\n(Section SI.8). Depending on usage scenarios, these fine-tuning datasets may need to be processed to prevent privacy\nleakage and converted into a format that is most efficient to fine-tune for downstream tasks. In-context few-shot learning\ncapability of LLMs, including limited high-quality data as part of the prompt can potentially improve the performance,\nand some researchers are already exploring such possibilities4.\nAdditionally, a significant portion of power system data comes in the form of long-range time series datasets from\ndiverse measuring instruments that may not be in natural language. This may require a customized design of more\nefficient embedding algorithms. Also, LLMs can only process a limited amount of information during each query,\nwhich is also known as context window, and power system signals may exhibit long-range dependence, which may not\nbe captured due to these limitations.\n3.2 Lack of Safety Guardrails\nSafety in the power system context includes a broad spectrum, encompassing equipment safety, personnel safety,\nend-user safety, and safe operation of the electric energy systems. LLMs integrated into the power system must uphold\nthese safety standards. Firstly, the results obtained from LLMs is probabilistic due to the nature of the generative models,\nand therefore, the correctness of responses may not be fully guaranteed. Secondly, LLMs generally do not provide\nuncertainty estimates for their outputs. Power system operations must comply with very strict safety performance\nguidelines, such as voltage magnitude limits. These power system operational requirements do not easily get satisfied\nby the LLMs. In our experiments, we observed that with subtle changes in prompts, LLMs generated varied responses\nand codes, which can potentially lead to erroneous results. We also found out that there are different ways LLMs could\nbe tricked into providing responses that are unsafe (see Section SI.8). The lack of customized safety guardrails may\nalso prevent us from performing some of the tasks necessary to do in electric energy systems. For example, during\nour experiments, we were not able to predict wildfire propagation or conduct auditing based solely on visual inputs.\nAdditionally, since the LLMs are trained based on a large corpus of data, we need to ensure that minority voices are not\nsuppressed14. Domain experts play a major role by providing real-time guidance and flagging problematic content to\ntrain LLMs.\nTherefore, while LLMs could greatly benefit the power industry, they also pose unique risks that are different from\ntraditional software systems. Hence, a governance framework is needed to mitigate their unique risks. As an example,\nthe U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) AI Risk Management Framework provides a voluntary\nguideline built upon the universal principles of responsible AI15. Creating a safe LLM-based system is a crucial area of\nresearch, especially in safety-critical infrastructure system such as the power industry.\n3.3 Not Adapted to Handle Physical Principles\nEnergy production and consumption is a complex process governed by a set of physical principles such as Maxwell’s\nequations, machine dynamics as well as human behavior. Modeling human behavior through LLMs, particularly in\ntasks like price forecasting and demand response policy design, presents formidable challenges, probably because prices\nare a much more compounded outcome of loads, human decisions, and market rules. Using more data might improve\nrenewable generation prediction, price forecasting (Section SI.6), and understanding of human behavior, which could\nbenefit power grid operation. While efforts have been underway to incorporate multiple specialized attention-seeking\ntransformers16 for decision-making, which could also be utilized for power flow analysis (Section SI.7), the LLMs used\nin the control process are heavily specialized.\nFoundational LLMs often lack explainability due to the black-box nature of these models. They can also be problematic\nin power systems where unexpected conditions can frequently arise. Therefore, LLM explainability will be a crucial\ncomponent of building systems that are interpretable and transparent 17. This also makes us believe that existing\nphysics-driven, complex, specialized tools for power engineers remain indispensable. General purpose LLMs can serve\n5\nas valuable assistants, summarizing and finding implications of decision-making and assisting power engineers through\ntool embedding without delving into complex processes.\n3.4 Potential Exposure to Cybersecurity and Privacy Threats\nWhile integrating large language models (LLMs) into electric energy systems, cybersecurity and privacy emerge as\na paramount concern. Even within the local LLM setups, there are potential cyber vulnerabilities. For example,\nbuilding an LLM using power system-related company-specific data could inadvertently expose organizations to\nprivilege escalation attacks, backdoor exploits, and the extraction of sensitive training data18. Online LLMs used for\nsafety-critical tasks, such as price forecasting (Section SI.6), would be a frequent target of cyber-attacks. Furthermore,\nspecialized prompts could be treated as trade secrets, which malicious actors could expose (Section SI.7).\nAs concerns regarding data privacy loom large, particularly as LLMs become integrated into power systems, establishing\na standard protocol becomes imperative to ensure the data is sufficiently anonymized and sanitized to remove personal\nidentification information before utilizing data for training. However, challenges persist in cases where personal or\ngroup information is context-dependent7.\n4 Future Prospects\nLLMs, such as, GPT models, have shown great promise in interpreting power engineering tasks through natural\nlanguage-based inputs. Through this study, we tested the capabilities and limitations of LLMs when applied to the\nelectric energy sector. We discussed the effectiveness of LLMs in answering general power system queries, code\ngeneration and data analysis. Further, through retrieval augmented generation, LLMs can serve as a documentation\nknowledge base and help with tasks such as operator training. Finally, the multi-modal capabilities of LLMs can\nbe useful in diagnosing equipment failure and remote monitoring. Effectively, general-purpose LLMs show strong\ncapabilities in detecting the correlation between objects (text, image, data), while they are still lacking in solving\nproblems highly related to physics, which usually involve complex mathematical principles.\nThere are multiple possibilities to expand and enhance the capabilities of LLMs in power system research and\napplications. The first direction is curated data collection for fine-tuning foundational LLMs. This would require\nstrong power system expertise to recognize the most effective data sources and design collection mechanisms to\nensure the availability of high-quality datasets. Uncertainty quantification of the outcome of the LLMs is also an\nimportant direction for research in the electric power sector. The second direction is to allow power-system-specific\ntool embeddings. There are already strong and diverse tools for various power system functionalities, and LLMs can\nserve as a central point to connect all these tools through high-quality embedding. Naïve embeddings are likely to\nlose efficiency and may further cause different tools to conflict; therefore, power system expertise may be required to\nidentify the desired behaviors for such tool embedding. A third direction is to build a power system knowledge base\nfor retrieval augmentation. Although there are already generic approaches to generating such knowledge bases, they\nmay not fully take advantage of physical constraints and power system specifics; therefore, this effort may require a\ndeep understanding of power system operation and capabilities. The future of foundational model-based AI tools as a\ndecision support co-pilot in the electric energy sector is bright.\n5 Declaration of Interests\nThe authors declare no competing interests.\n6 Acknowledgements\nThis work is supported in part by the Texas A&M Engineering Smart Grid Center and Texas A&M Energy Institute.\n6\nReferences\n1.

Experiments appear in the same order as they were\nintroduced in Figure 1 of the main article. Detailed discussions on the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in the main\narticle have primarily been drawn from these experimental results. For each experiment, we first briefly introduce the\nrelevant power engineering applications and then elaborate on how we have utilized the LLM to solve the underlying\ntask. For experimentation and analysis, we have explicitly used OpenAI’s GPT series models either through Web\nInterface (WI) or through Application Programming Interface (API). Unless specifically mentioned, we utilized WI for\nexperimentation. It should be noted that the experiments conducted in this supplemental information are only meant to\nexplore the many capabilities and limitations of LLM in the electric energy sector. Due to the generative nature of the\nLLMs, each time, the answers may not be consistent. Future research will investigate each of these use cases in much\nmore detail. All the codes, prompts, and specific datasets as a part of this research analysis are available in1. While the\ndetailed step-by-step responses generated by the LLM are not reproduced in their entirety in this document, they can be\naccessed through our shared Github repository.\nSection Items:\n• SI.1: Correlation Analysis for the Power Systems\n• SI.1.1: Correlation Analysis with Power Flow Data\n• SI.1.2: Correlation Analysis with Demand and Prices Data\n• SI.2: Wildfire Risks Recognition on the Power Lines\n• SI.3: Equipment Damage Detection in Power Grids\n• SI.4: On-site Hazards Recognition\n• SI.5: Document analysis for power systems\n• SI.5.1: Document Summarizing\n• SI.5.2: Knowledge Pool Analysis Through Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n• SI.6: Forecasting in Power Systems: Load and Price Forecasts\n• SI.7: Power Flow-related Problems\n• SI.7.1: Power Flow\n• SI.7.2: Optimal Power Flow\n• SI.8: Ensuring Safe Power Systems Operation\narXiv:2403.09125v5  [eess.SY]  20 Jun 2024\nSI.1 Correlation Analysis for the Power Systems\nCorrelation analysis is a valuable tool for identifying the influence of one parameter on another, reducing the necessity\nfor elaborate simulations commonly employed in power systems analysis. Its utility extends to control rooms, where\noperators can employ it as a preliminary step before in-depth analysis. Here, we emphasize two primary aspects\nconcerning power systems operators: (i) the pivotal role of correlation analysis in augmenting decision-making within\ncontrol rooms, and (ii) its potential to unveil insights into the dynamics of specific load demands. Our objective is\ntwofold: to assess the efficacy of the foundational GPT model in aiding this endeavor and to explore how incremental\nprompt engineering can bridge this gap. It should be highlighted that this study is an exploratory analysis and not a\ncomprehensive performance evaluation.\nSI.1.1 Correlation Analysis with Power Flow Data\nTo be able to perform correlation analysis with power flow data, we have conducted a detailed simulation with an IEEE\n24-node RTS, modified by wind generators at nodes 18, 21, and 22 and solar generators at nodes 2 and 3. We utilized\nPyPower for power flow calculations, with the results serialized into time-series CSV files for correlation analysis.\nNotably, the code to run PyPower and store the generated data in the CSV file was obtained from the GPT-4 Web\nInterface (WI). GPT-4 seems well-versed in the PyPower data structure, which would be useful in data analysis. GPT-4\nWI also interprets dictionaries in JSON format extremely well.\nSubsequently, we queried the GPT-4 with the dictionaries and CSV files in the following way. A sample of the network’s\narchitecture in JSON format is also provided below for reference:\nBuses \"1\": {\"type\":2, \"Pd\":83.85, \"Qd\":22.0, \"area\":1, \"Vm\":1.0, \"Va\":0.0, \"zone\":1, \"V A\":\"bus_1_V A\", \"PD\":\"bus_1_PD\"}\nGenerators \"1\": {\"bus\":1,\"Pg\":10.0,\"Qg\":0.0,\"status\":1,\"Pmax\":100.0,\"Pmin\":16.0,\"PG\":\"gen_1_PG\"}\nBranches \"1\": {\"x\":0.01, rateA\":350.0, \"ratio\":0.0, \"angle\":0.0, \"status\":1, \"from_bus\":1, \"to_bus\":2, \"PF\": \"branch_2_PF\",\n\"PT\":\"branch_2_PT\"},\nThe CSV file contains time series power flow data. Can you perform exploratory data analytics for me? The dictionary for\ninterpreting the csv file is also provided. Please load the dictionaries first.\nBased on our observation, at GPT-4’s current capability, it may not load the dictionary first, which often results in\nmisidentification of the CSV file containing power flow data. The prompt “Please load the dictionaries first.” seems to\nalleviate this challenge.\nWhile we have indicated that the GPT-4 seems to automatically focus on exploratory data analysis, of which correlation\nis an integral part, for time series power flow data. If we slightly change our query to “provide us with insights”, the\ngenerated response differs significantly. Comparative visualization of LLMs responses are shown in Figure S1. Figure\nS1(a) demonstrates how changing loads and generations impact power flow. Figure S1(b) demonstrates comprehensive\ncorrelation analysis as provided by GPT-4. Here, red represents a positive correlation, and blue represents a negative\ncorrelation.\nIn the next prompt, we ask the GPT-4 about the lines approaching their limits, and from the generated Python code, we\nobserve that it correctly compares the maximum of the absolute value of the branch flows while comparing with flow\nlimits as available in the JSON dictionary:\nmax_flows = data[branch_pf_columns].abs().max().reset_index()\nmax_flows.columns = [‘Branch’, ‘Max Flow’]\nIn the subsequent prompt, we furnish GPT-4 with the specifics regarding the locations of the wind and solar generators\nmentioned earlier. We then pose the query“how solar and wind generators are contributing to the line congestion”. GPT\nresponds by highlighting some branches that negatively correlate with power generation, this is also evident in Figure\nS1(b). However, based on our electrical engineering knowledge, we know that line flows are direction-specific, which\ncan also be seen in Figure S1(a). Still, our objective here is to ascertain whether renewable energy sources contribute\nto line overload. To ensure accurate analysis, we provide additional guidance: “Knowledge: When comparing power\ngeneration or load with branch flow, please consider the absolute value.” With this knowledge, GPT-4 can accurately\nidentify the correlation between generator injection and branch flow. Additionally, GPT-4 generates a scatterplot\nillustrating the impact of solar/wind generation on line flows as shown in Figure S2 . GPT-4 can also estimate overloads\nfor an unknown scenario based on these correlations.\n(a) LLM asked to provide insights based on power flow data.\n(b) LLM asked to perform EDA with power flow data.\nFigure S1: Correlation analysis demonstrating GPT-4 WI’s capability in analyzing power flow data (Figures generated\nby GPT).\n(a) LLM generated solar vs branch flow correlation.\n(b) LLM generated wind vs branch flow correlation.\nFigure S2: Correlation analysis between renewable generation and branch flow (Figures generated by GPT).\nSI.1.2 Correlation Analysis with Demand and Prices Data\nAnalyzing the correlation between demand and prices is significant for distinguishing load groups contributing to\ndemand response initiatives. Identifying such correlation could be of absolute importance to an operator in managing\nresources, especially during peak demand days. For such analysis, we compiled a large time-series dataset comprising\nhistorical real-time price data, day-ahead price data, total wind generation, total solar generation, aggregated system-\nwide load demand, and the farm load data, which we tried to model. We provided the following prompt to the GPT-4\nwith the first two rows of the CSV file provided for reference.\ntime rtm_lz_south dam_lz_south wind solar ercot farm_load\n7/1/2022 0:00 0.015257266 0.019299607 0.668166171 0 0.650940015 0.998710355\n7/1/2022 1:00 0.010880517 0.016610027 0.684359174 0 0.615978621 0.997153536\n... ... ... ... ... ... ...\nI wanted to model the farm load as available in the ‘.csv’ file. Can you help me with the exploratory data analytics?\nGPT-4 demonstrates an ability to discern contextual cues within the dataset, interpreting column headers such as\n‘rtm_lz_south’ and ‘dam_lz_south’ as indicative of real-time and day-ahead prices, respectively. It contextualizes\n‘wind’ and ‘solar’ columns further to identify them as corresponding to respective generation availability, while ‘ercot’\nrepresents an energy-related metric specific to Texas. Notably, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the\ntransmission grid operator in Texas, USA, widely utilizes the column header ‘ercot’ to signify total electricity demand\nacross ERCOT-managed areas.\nGiven the enormous scope of exploratory data analytics, GPT-4 suggests a few possible directions, and upon request for\n“consider your best judgment”, it performs time-series visualization, correlation analysis, and distribution analysis, with\nkey insights and visualizations as shown in Figure S3. Based on our observation, in two subsequent interactions, GPT-4\nrecommends constructing a load forecasting model utilizing LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), an AI-model typically\nused for forecasting. However, when generating the answer, we again observe a lack of self-awareness of the GPT-4,\n(a) Correlation in the data across multiple columns.\n(b) Data visualizations through histograms.\nFigure S3: LLM demand and prices correlation analysis visualization (Figures generated by GPT).\nwhere it prepares a Python script to train an LSTM model using the TensorFlow/Keras environment, encountering errors\nlikely due to platform limitations—potentially imposed by the OpenAI. It’s worth noting that such constraints may be\nmitigated when executing the code on local machines, reducing the likelihood of encountering such issues in actual\ndeployment.\nIn the second experiment, we directed GPT-4 to identify why the loads are behaving in a certain way, especially when\nthe loads are below 0.9. GPT responded by conducting regression analysis using random forest. However, recognizing\nthat power systems engineers might be more familiar with regression methods, we adjusted our prompt accordingly.\nGPT then conducted linear regression without data transformation. When we specifically inquired “about the accuracy\nof this model based on the residuals,” GPT identified that the residuals are expected to be normally distributed around\nzero. Additionally, GPT-4 flagged potential issues such as heteroscedasticity or autocorrelation in the residuals and\nproposed applying transformations to address them but did not apply them automatically.\nKey points:\n(i) LLMs require contextual information for time-series data analysis. LLMs lack crucial insights about power\nsystems and, therefore, still require human oversight and guidance for insights.\n(ii) LLMs exhibit proficiency in conducting exploratory data analysis even without explicit guidance, yielding\ndesired models. However, the model could be erroneous unless the user specifically checks for the model’s\naccuracy.\n(iii) LLMs may not inherently address data distribution issues unless specifically prompted. Power systems\nengineers may not always be able to understand these nuances, and LLMs do not bridge these gaps.\nSI.2 Wildfire Risks Recognition on the Power Lines\nHistorically, wildfires have caused unprecedented damages in California, USA, causing nearly $20 billion in property\ndamage over the past five years alone. These events pushed PG&E, a major utility company, to bankruptcy. As\nwildfires progress, power systems operators would receive a meteorological map as part of situational awareness, and\nthe operators could be interested in overlaying the weather map onto the power map to assess the risk of the power lines.\nWe wanted to investigate whether LLM’s multi-modal capabilities could be leveraged to identify the risk of wildfires on\npower lines. To demonstrate this capability, we utilized data from the August Complex wildfire, California’s largest\nwildfire in 2020. This wildfire persisted throughout August, September, and October. The wildfire-affected areas (maps\nare sourced from2) and transmission line maps (sourced from3) are given in Figure S4.\n(a) Fire situation in August.\n (b) Fire situation in September.\n (c) Fire situation in October.\n (d) Transmission Line Map.\nFigure S4: August complex wildfire map and transmission lines.\nWe prompted GPT-4 with the instruction: “I will provide you with a wildfire map of August, September, and October.\nThe area in red implies the wildfire area. A map of transmission lines is provided for the same area. Can you extract\nthe wildfire areas for all three months and plot them in distinguishable colors on top of the transmission line map?”\nGiven that we uploaded multiple files together, the identification of labels is not trivial. We observe from the generated\ncodebases that GPT-4 can browse through metadata (e.g., file name) to correctly label the figures and use them for\noverlaying. This is demonstrated in Figure S5(b).\n(a) Example 1\n (b) Example 2\n (c) Example 3\nFigure S5: LLM’s Variational Results: wildfires superimposed on transmission Lines (Figures generated by GPT-4\nthrough overlaying by generating suitable codes).\nThe generative nature of the LLMs is visible in Figure S5. Based on our experience, LLMs exclusively utilize tool\nembedding for image manipulation. Upon close inspection, we observe that the code primarily fails due to mistakes in\nfilter applications. To investigate if prompt engineering can reduce some of the variabilities in code generation, we\nperformed two additional sets of experiments and extracted the Python code generated by the GPT-4 across multiple\ntrial runs. We then utilize the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) data structure to compare the generated Python codes and\ngenerate the similarity score4. For the scenario in Figure S7(A), we provided all three wildfire maps as well as the\ntransmission line map to the GPT, while for the scenarios in Figure S7(B) and (C) we considered only one of the\nwildfire maps. It can be seen that directness in the prompt can help GPT-4 to understand the problem statement better,\nand the codes so generated across multiple runs can become nearly identical, leading to a decreasing AST score. In all\nthree scenarios, we conducted these experiments utilizing the map data obtained from Fire Information for Resource\nManagement System of NASA5, as shown in Figure S6.\n(a) Fire situation in August.\n (b) Fire situation in September.\n (c) Fire situation in October.\n (d) Transmission Line Map.\nFigure S6: Unannotated August complex wildfire map and transmission lines (revised).\n(A) (B) (C)\nCan you extract all red patches from \nthis map? Ignore everything in white. \nPlease make this image transparent.\nRemove all background, and keep only \nred area for me.\nI will provide you with a wildfire map \nof August, September, and October. The \narea in red implies the wildfire area. A \nmap of transmission lines is provided \nfor the same area. Can you extract the \nwildfire areas for all three months and \nplot them in distinguishable colors on \ntop of the transmission line map?\nFigure S7: Variation in the codebase generated using python tool. Histograms in Figures (A), (B) and (C) are generated\nusing codes considering different prompts.\nWe utilized the best prompt in the previous experiments, namely,“Remove all background and keep only red area for\nme\" for extracting wildfire-affected regions. While the generated codes are similar, differences exist in the extraction\nprocess, as highlighted in Figures S8(b) and S8(c). Nevertheless, once the images with transparent backgrounds are\ngenerated, they can be superimposed on top of the transmission line map as shown in S8(d).\n(a) Wildfire map obtained from\nFIRMS.\n (b) Extraction error.\n(c) Filtered wildfire area with\ntransparent background.\n(d) Wildfire superimposed on\ntransmission lines.\nFigure S8: August complex wildfire map and transmission lines (Figures (b), (c) and (d) are generated through GPT).\nNext, we utilized an iterative approach to generate the wildfire map overlayed on the power line as demonstrated\nin Figure S9. We systematically extracted wildfire-affected areas and overlayed all the extracted figures atop one\nanother to gain a comprehensive understanding of the wildfire’s impact on power lines. This exercise demonstrates that\nLLMs could be leveraged to overlay wildfire risk onto the electric energy systems map for visualization and situational\nawareness.\nDemonstrates the utilized codebase\nPrompt 1 Prompt 2 Prompt 3 Prompt 4\nFigure S9: LLM-generated wildfire impact on transmission line identification and visualization (Bottom figures\ngenerated by GPT-4 through overlaying).\nWith this capability in mind, we presented GPT-4 with this prompt: “In the wildfire map, the green patches symbolize\nvegetation. Can you show the area that can catch fire next month?” However, we encountered a bottleneck with this\ncommand, where GPT-4 indicated: “As an AI, I’m unable to predict future wildfire spread as I do not have real-time\ndata or the ability to run such models.” such limitation appears to be an imposition by OpenAI, which may not be a\nconcern with localized LLMs.\nKey points:\n(i) The capability of LLMs is continuously improving. However, GPTs are generative models. Based on their\ncontextualization, the results can vary widely.\n(ii) Prompt engineering can help in dividing the overall tasks into manageable tasks that GPT can do without error\nand would improve their credibility to the power systems engineers.\nSI.3 Equipment Damage Detection in Power Grids\nWith the growing complexity of power systems infrastructures, manual condition monitoring of equipment becomes\npractically infeasible. While machine learning can aid engineers6, such a capability would require training with a vast\namount of data, which may not always be available. Given the foundational model nature of GPTs and leveraging its\nmulti-modal feature, we wanted to investigate if LLMs can detect faulty equipment.\nInitially, we explored whether GPT-4 could accurately identify faulty insulators using its inherent knowledge. En-\ncountering limited accuracy, we aimed to overcome this by introducing a richer set of examples of intact and faulty\ninsulators as shown in S10. We tagged every intact insulator as \"Intact.\" Conversely, each faulty insulator was labeled\nand accompanied by a detailed description of its defects.\n(a)\n (b)\n (c)\n (d)\nFigure S10: Images of faulty insulators presented to GPT-4 for comprehension/questionnaire.\nWe introduced the figures to the GPT-4 one by one using the following knowledge base as a part of few-shot learning.\nFigure (a): Insulator with breakage on the third layer. Status: Failure.\nFigure (b): Insulator is not damaged. Status: Intact.\nFigure (c): Insulator with breakage on the fifth layer. Status: Failure.\nNow, tell me the status of Figure (d).\nThis strategy was designed to implement the few-shot prompt technique to improve GPT’s ability to distinguish faulty\nand intact insulators by supplying clear, well-defined examples and criteria. Consequently, GPT-4 demonstrated a\nmarked improvement, successfully recognizing insulator status with greater accuracy.\nTo assess accuracy quantitatively, we used a dataset comprising 40 insulators evenly split between intact and defective\nconditions. The GPT model tended to mislabel defective insulators when encountering unfamiliar failure conditions.\nGPT-4 sometimes mistook shadows for actual chips, leading to false classifications. Overall accuracy with this few-shot\ntraining method is reported in Table S1. Although the accuracy achieved in this study is lower than the results reported\nby6, which exceeds 90%, it is important to note that our dataset was significantly smaller than theirs, and we did not use\nany synthetic images for training.\nTable S1: Insulator Accuracy\nDataset Accuracy(%)\nOverall Accuracy 80\nOnly Intact Insulator 85\nOnly Faulty Insulator 70\nWe continued our evaluation of this experiment by analyzing GPT’s robustness in two additional scenarios: (i) whether\nthe responses were consistent across various prompts and (ii) how the accuracy of the responses was influenced by the\nquality of the images used. As a part of the first question, we utilized an identical training dataset within a different\nprompt to analyze the outcomes. Our findings showed that, despite asking questions in various styles while conveying\nthe same information, GPT-4 responses were consistent in this case. As for the second question, we investigated how\nGPT performs where low-quality images were presented as a part of the question and where the context images were of\nhigh quality. These low-quality images were generated in6. We observe that the GPT fails to identify faulty Insulators\neven with apparent flaws.\nThese assessments suggest that while both prompt engineering and multi-modal LLMs are promising candidates for\nfacilitating fault detection tasks in power grids, further research is required to enhance their performance and robustness.\nUltimately, it is important to highlight that although our analysis was exclusively focused on insulators, the methodology\nwe employed can be adapted to include a wider range of power system equipment.\nKey points:\n(i) Due to vast pre-training datasets, LLMs may achieve satisfying performance while requiring less data compared\nto models developed from scratch.\n(ii) LLMs may struggle to accurately label insulators if they encounter faults that have not been previously seen.\nSI.4 On-site Hazards Recognition\nElectrical work around the power grid infrastructures ranks among the most hazardous professions, necessitating\nunwavering attention and stringent precautions throughout operations. Supervision and safety checks are indispensable\nto ensure adherence to these protocols. Remote supervision offers efficiency in ensuring safe operation around power\ngrid infrastructures. To investigate GPT’s proficiency in recognizing risks around the power lines, we posed the question\n“Between 0-10 give me a safety score for the given figure” with Figure S11.\nFigure S11: Electrical project site. Taken from7.\nOur expectation behind this prompt was to investigate whether an LLM would properly recognize hazards and alert site\nengineers to take necessary actions. However, we encountered a bottleneck when GPT-4 indicated:“I can’t give a precise\nnumerical safety score,” which is an artificial constraint imposed by OpenAI as we suspected. Nonetheless, GPT-4\ndemonstrated its ability to identify several critical safety concerns, including ‘Proximity to power lines’, ‘Personal\nprotective equipment (PPE)’, ‘Stability of the crane’, ‘Fall protection’, ‘Observing a safe working radius’. To gain\ninsight into GPT’s situational awareness regarding power lines, we prompted it with the question, “What factor should I\nconsider for giving score for working around power lines.” we devised the following prompt based on the response\nfrom GPT-4 with a range list of factors:\nGive an aggregated safety score for this picture.\nInstruction: First, allocate a score between 0-10 for each of the following factors. If you are unsure about a particular aspect,\ngive it a score of 5. My aggregated score will be the average of all individual scores.\nFactors: Distance from Power Lines, Use of Insulating Equipment, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), Training and\nAwareness, Lockout/Tagout Procedures, Warning Signs and Barriers, Weather Conditions, Supervision and Safety Protocols,\nEmergency Plans, Inspection and Maintenance\nWe observed that GPT-4 provided the following individual scores(s) in one of the instances: Distance from Power\nLines (Score: 2), Use of Insulating Equipment (Score: 2), Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) (Score: 1), Training\nand Awareness (Score: 3), Lockout/Tagout Procedures (Score: 2), Warning Signs and Barriers (Score: 1), Weather\nConditions (Score: 8), Supervision and Safety Protocols (Score: 3), Emergency Plans (Score: 5, unavailable), Inspection\nand Maintenance (Score: 5, unavailable). Given the limitations of self-consistency prompting, we observed that GPT-4\nemployed its embedded Python tool to compute aggregated scores in the backend. To investigate the ability to deploy\nthis method in the real world, we have repeated this experiment 55 times, and the distribution of individual components\nscores and the aggregated score is given in Figure S12.\nIt can be observed that the aggregated audit score lies between 3 and 4 (out of 10) for ∼60% of the time, with a peak\nat 3.5, symbolizing the GPT-4 consistently identifies hazards and poor operating conditions around the electricity\ninfrastructures. To understand what contributes to these variations, we looked into distributions of individual components\nof the audit score. The prompt specifically states that we should allocate a score of 5 if uncertain, and we observe the\nassociated impact on the decision-making. For the individual metrics, such as Training and Awareness, Lockout/Tagout\nProcedures, Supervision and Safety Protocols, Emergency Plans, Inspection, and Maintenance, it is hard to determine\nthe presence of these protocols from one picture, so we observe GPT-4 allocating a score of 5 in those cases in several\ninstances. We also observe GPT-4 consistently drawing lower values, for example, in Lockout/Tagout Procedures,\nSupervision, and Safety Protocols, where GPT-4 seems to be quite certain that these guidelines are not being followed.\nScore\nA.

(B) Aggregated Audit Score.\nGiven the unsafeness of the operating condition, GPT-4 extrapolates the absence of warning signs and barriers. Finally,\nwhile we observe a blue sky from one picture, it is hard to determine the entire weather condition. Therefore, we\nobserve GPT-4 allocating scores ranging from 6 to 9, with scores peaking at 8, symbolizing the GPT-4 is able to capture\nthe uncertainty.\nThese experiments demonstrate the suitability of GPTs in real-world situational surveillance based on constant supply\nof images and we can extrapolate that videos could also be suitably embedded for this applications. Therefore, this tool\ncan be of immense value to power engineers.\nKey points:\n(i) LLMs have the capability to identify on-site security risks and furnish supervisors with necessary feedback\nwith sufficient prompts.\n(ii) Including more contexts in the calculation of scores would help in generating consistent safety scores for\ndecision-making.\nSI.5 Document analysis for power systems\nIn power systems management, efficient processing of information is crucial for effective decision-making. This sector\nrelies extensively on diverse documents such as protocols, guidelines, and technical reports, making it crucial to utilize\ntools that can adeptly manage this information. This section examines two such tools ideally suited for document\nprocessing in the power system domain: the GPT-4 Web Interface (WI) and the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\nmodel. We assess the GPT-4 WI by its performance in document summarization tasks, and evaluate the RAG model\nthrough its capability for question answering, which aligns well with its design purpose. It should be highlighted that\nthis study is an exploratory analysis and not a comprehensive performance evaluation.\nSI.5.1 Document Summarizing\nIn this context, we referred to the Department of Energy (DoE)’s technical report8 on smart grids and tasked the GPT-4\nWI with summarizing the document without providing additional context. GPT-4 excelled in comprehending and\ndiscussing all sections of the 170-page report. It summarized smart grids as “more intelligent, efficient, and resilient\ninfrastructure through the adoption of digital sensing, communication, and control technologies.” However, we sought to\nexplore how GPT-4 would perform with more specific instructions. To this end, we asked it to“interpret the document\nfrom the perspective of a power system technician?” In response, GPT-4 provided a more detailed and technical\nsummary, describing smart grids as “transition from traditional grid systems to more advanced, digitally enabled grids\nthat integrate renewable energy sources, manage distributed energy resources (DERs), and enhance grid reliability\nand efficiency through digital communication and control technologies.” These varied responses clearly demonstrate\nGPT’s ability to tailor its analysis based on the audience or questions posed, which could be instrumental in developing\nstructured summaries.\nThis experiment not only served as a practical demonstration of the GPT-4 WI’s capabilities in document processing\nbut also highlighted the importance of customized prompts in significantly improving the system’s ability to generate\nspecialized content, affirming its potential as a valuable tool in technical fields.\nSI.5.2 Knowledge Pool Analysis Through Retrieval-Augmented Generation\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the performance of LLMs by combining their text-generating\ncapabilities with the ability to retrieve relevant information from external databases. This integration significantly\nimproves both the accuracy and contextual relevance of the responses generated by LLMs. Introduced in 9, RAG\nfirst processes the content of the query. It then uses this processed query to search an external database to find the\nmost relevant text fragments. This search typically employs vector similarity measures, where both the query and\nthe documents are represented as high-dimensional vectors. The goal is to retrieve documents whose vectors closely\nmatch the query vector, indicating high relevance to the input query. Given the promising enhancements brought by the\nRAG system, in this section, we evaluate RAG’s effectiveness in the power sector by assessing its question-answering\ncapabilities across power-specific documents.\nWe integrate Langchain with OpenAI’s API to develop a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, utilizing the\nGPT-3.5-Turbo model. Following data segmentation, we employ the following techniques for processing:\n• OpenAIEmbeddings which utilize Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) for tokenization and vectorization.\n• Facebook AI Similarity Search is employed for storing vectors, which is crucial for the retrieval capabilities\nof our RAG system.\nIn our investigation of RAG’s potential as a knowledge repository, we concentrated on nodal protocols 2 through 9 from\nERCOT10. Initially, we appended these documents into a single corpus for analysis and then segmented this corpus to\nfacilitate the knowledge examination. Our evaluation of RAG’s performance was based on two types of questions: (i)\nthose that could be directly answered from the text (e.g., \"What is the Opportunity Outage?\"), and (ii) those that require\nnuanced reasoning for a response (e.g., \"How do you calculate physical responsive ancillary service capability across\nERCOT?\" - the term ’Ancillary service’ was included in the question to introduce complexity).\nBased on our repeated experiments so far, we observed that RAG can provide more accurate and coherent answers\nto direct questions. As shown in S13, when compared with the excerpt from the ERCOT nodal protocol, the RAG’s\nresponses surpassed even those generated by the GPT-4 WI in terms of precision and alignment. However, RAG’s\nability got diminished when addressing more complex queries. For example, it either failed to provide an answer or\noffered responses that are not thorough and vary with each attempt. As demonstrated in S14(a), RAG struggled to\npinpoint the correct response according to nodal protocol 6.5.7.5, Even when tested under lower temperatures. In LLMs,\nthe temperature parameter influences the level of creativity or randomness allowed in the model’s responses, with\nhigher temperatures resulting in more creative and varied outputs and lower temperatures producing more predictable\ntext. Furthermore, as highlighted in S14(b), RAG generated a diverse set of responses. While none of the responses\nhighlighted here are incorrect, they often lack comprehensiveness. For instance, the right prompt accurately stated that a\nqualified scheduling entity (QSE) that meets all the required criteria is eligible to become a must-run alternative (MRA)\nservice provider. Yet, it failed to capture all the detailed nuances. Conversely, the left prompt mentioned various types\nof MRAs but did not specifically address the QSEs.\nWe further explored these issues by testing the same questions using the GPT-4 WI. After uploading the nodal protocols\ninto the chat and posing the same questions, we observed similar fluctuations in the GPT-4 WI’s responses, especially\nconcerning questions about MRAs. However, in scenarios where RAG was unable to provide an answer, such as the one\ninvolving physical responsive ancillary service capabilities, the GPT-4 WI managed to deliver a partially correct answer.\nThese experiments suggest that while the RAG model and the GPT-4 WI demonstrate promising capabilities, their\neffective implementation in power systems requires additional refinement and adaptation.\nFigure S13: Quality of response for different models for more direct questions\n(a)\n (b)\nFigure S14: Comparison of RAG’s performance over complex questions: (a) RAG’s inability to find answers for more\ncomplex questions. (b) Non-comprehensive answers for nuanced questions\nKey points:\n(i) RAG-based LLMs demonstrate improved domain-specific answers.\n(ii) Their performance may surpass that of simply uploading the file to a chatbot (such as GPT-4 WI).\n(iii) LLMs may fail to generate any response or generate varied responses to questions that require nuanced answers.\nThe prompt engineering can be extremely useful to reduce these variabilities.\nSI.6 Forecasting in Power Systems: Load and Price Forecasts\nForecasting is a key responsibility for power systems engineers to maintain the balance of demand and supply within\nthe electric grid. For instance, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the transmission grid operator in\nTexas, USA, regularly publishes forecasts of loads, prices, and renewable generation production on its dashboard. The\naccuracy of these forecasts is paramount to ensuring the grid’s reliability. Price forecasts are important for parties\nparticipating in the energy market. In this section, we present a comparative analysis of three distinct techniques\nfacilitated by LLMs for load and day-ahead market clearing price forecasting. To conduct our analysis, we draw upon\nhourly weather data for Texas, USA, sourced from the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB)11, alongside hourly\nload and electricity price data retrieved from the ERCOT open database12,13. We compiled a time-stamped CSV file\nencompassing historical weather data, aggregated ERCOT load information, and hourly day-ahead load zone settlement\npoint prices for the ‘Houston’ load zone of ERCOT.\n(i) We engage the GPT-4 Web Interface (WI) with the prompt: “Given the time-series pairs of load and tem-\nperature, I want to find out the time-series load profile given the time-series temperature profile.” the GPT-4\nWI conducts exploratory data analysis and suggests: “Given the non-linear relationship between load and\ntemperature, models like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting could perform well due to their ability to\ncapture complex patterns.” The GPT-4 WI notably generates Python code in the background for execution.\nBased on our experiments, we could not directly take advantage of pre-trained transformers, the backbone of\nLLMs, to perform forecasting with numerical time-series data.\n(ii) Large-language models are engineered to adeptly handle linguistic tasks. Building upon this capability,\nwe transform historical data into conversational formats. In this approach, numerical data is encoded into\nalphabetic representations, such that 0 →A, 1 →B, and so forth, up to 9 →J. Additionally, the symbol −\nis represented as N. Consequently, numerical sequences such as 12 translate to BC, while −509 converts to\nNFAJ. We have converted the hourly time series numerical data in the CSV file with temperature, loads, and\nprice into a three-person conversational structure. This approach is illustrated in the following example:\nPerson 1: HD HD HC HC HD HE HE HD HD HE HG IA ID IG IH IH IH IH IH IG IF ID IC IB\nPerson 2: EF ED EB EB EA EC ED EE EG EI FB FE FH FJ GB GD GD GD GC GA FJ FH FE FB\nPerson 3: DAJ DAF CJD CIC CJF CHC CIH CIE CIG CIH CIG CHJ CJE DAF DEA DDG DFI DEI DDA DDJ\nDFC DCD DCB CJG\nHere, person 1 signifies the temperature (in ◦F with decimal points removed), person 2 as loads (in GW with\ndecimal points removed), and person 3 as prices in ($/MWh with decimal points removed). When utilizing\nGPT-4 WI for this purpose, we noticed that the responses tended to be quite verbose, often elaborating on\nwhy a particular answer was chosen and providing a likely sequence. However, when employing GPT-3.5\nWI for the same task, we observed swift responses for persons 2 and 3. Subsequently, we need to revert the\ngenerated solution to generate the forecast. Upon inquiring about the methodology, “when you generated\nlikely responses for Person 2 and Person 3, did you utilize your pre-trained transformer built within yourself\nfor this activity?” we get the response, “Yes, I utilized my pre-trained transformer architecture for generating\nthe likely responses for Person 2 and Person 3.”\n(iii) In the first two examples, we directly interacted with the GPT-4 WI. One can also leverage the API to fine-tune\nGPT-3.5. Unlike method (i), where we utilize LLM-generated code, and method (ii), where we exploit the\npre-trained transformer within the LLM, this method directly allows us to modify the GPT transformer model\nbased on our own dataset14. In this setup, we first fine-tune GPT-3.5 with one-year historical hourly resolution\ndata and query the model to generate forecasts for the next day by following the official guidance15. Below is\na JSON entry representing a typical prompt used for training:\n{\"messages\": {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are an electrical engineer who predict electricity price\nbased on provided information\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Here is information for previous day:\nLoads: 43719.85, 43321.05... What’s load forecast for today?\"},{\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Here is\nthe load forecast for today: 44688.67, 42656.83, 41196.68, 40377.20, 39906.83...\"}\nIn the first approach, we employed a simple linear regression model through GPT-4 WI for our task. As reported in16,\nduring summer times, higher temperatures can correlate to higher load demands, and this relationship gets reversed\nduring winter times, where lower temperatures can correlate to higher demand. Due to this season-based linear\ncorrelation, linear regression could be useful for load forecasting. However, this method struggles in price forecasting\nTrue load\nForecast with GPT-suggested linear model (MAPE=19%) \nForecast with text embedding (MAPE = 15%)\nForecast with 'fine-tuned' GPT (MAPE=8%) \nLoad (GW)\n40\n50\n60\n70\n06:00 12:00 18:00 24:00\nTime (Hour Ending)\n01:00\n(a) Short-term load forecast (with confidence interval)\nTrue price\nForecast with GPT-suggested linear model (MAPE=91%) \nForecast with text embedding (MAPE=132%)\nForecast with 'fine-tuned' GPT (MAPE=84%) \n06:00 12:00 18:00 24:00\nTime (Hour Ending)\n01:00\n20\n40\n60\n125\nPrice ($/MWh)\n-300\n175 (b) Short-term price forecast (with confidence interval)\nFigure S15: Comparison of LLM-based load and price forecasts considering a typical day.\nTrue load\nForecast with GPT-suggested linear mode (MAPE=14%)\nForecast with text embedding (MAPE=7%)\nForecast with 'fine-tuned' GPT (MAPE=4%)\n6/7/22 6/8/22 6/9/22 6/10/22\nDay\n6/6/22\nLoad (GW)\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n6/11/22 6/12/22 6/13/22\n(a) Weekly load forecast (with confidence interval)\nTrue load\nForecast with GPT-suggested linear model (MAPE=12%)\nForecast with text embedding (MAPE=62%))\nForecast with 'fine-tuned' GPT (MAPE=10%)\n1/15/24 1/16/24 1/17/24\nDay\nLoad (GW)\n25\n40\n60\n80\n125\n1/14/24-25\n175 (b) Load forecast during winter peaks (with confidence interval)\nTrue load\nForecast with GPT-suggested linear model (MAPE=4%) \nForecast with text embedding (MAPE=4%))\nForecast with 'fine-tuned' GPT (MAPE=2%)\n7/19/22 7/20/22\nDay\nLoad (GW)\n55\n65\n75\n85\n 45\n(c) Load forecast during summer peaks (with confidence interval)\nFigure S16: Comparison of LLM-based load forecasts considering multiple days.\ndue to the inherent complexity of the patterns within the price information. As for the second approach, the transformer\narchitecture demonstrates an enhanced capability to discern intricate patterns. However, for this method, we need to\nconvert the data back into numeric format. The fine-tuned GPT does not suffer from related challenges with significant\nimprovement in forecasting accuracy. Comparative assessments of load forecasting for 06/06/2022 and day-ahead\nmarket price forecasts for 01/02/2022 of ERCOT system-wide data, as determined by these three methods, are given in\nFigure S15. We repeated the experiments 20 times for each method for the same day to obtain the mean and confidence\ninterval to show the robustness of the result, both of which are plotted in the figure. We have compared the mean value\nof the GPT-generated results with the true measurements to assess the accuracy of the models. We have considered\nmean absolute percentage error (MAPE) to compare the accuracy.\nThe results reveal that for short-term load forecasting on the selected day, the fine-tuned model achieves commendable\naccuracy. Model (ii) that incorporates text embedding also achieves reasonable accuracy. However, in the case of\nprice forecasts, the proposed methods performed notably worse than the load forecast scenario. This underscores the\ncomplexity of price information, which entails intricate interdependencies with other variables that are not accounted\nfor in this exercise. It underscores the necessity for further research and refinement in this area.\nGiven the accuracy of our models on the short-term load forecasts, we further compared GPT’s performance in\nlonger-term forecasting, and the results are demonstrated in Figure S16. According to the results, we further show\nthat our method has competitive performance in the weekly scenario. It also shows the forecast errors are only 2% to\n4% MAPE compared to the actual load for the summer peak. However, winter peak forecasting is very challenging.\nThis is because, as discussed before, the correlation between temperature and electrical load reverses during the winter\nseasons. Given that the majority of the time, temperature and ERCOT system load demands show positive correlations,\nforecasting results obtained utilizing each of the three methodologies perform poorly. Furthermore, the results obtained\nthrough the text embedding method worsened during the winter peaks. This is possible because embedding a negative\nsign is difficult for GPT due to limited data within the context window.\nTo examine the generalization capacity of the GPT model for load forecasting tasks, we performed fine-tuning\nmethodology utilizing the GEF14 dataset from Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014 17. The results are\nbenchmarked against the deep learning models evaluated in18. For evaluation consistency, the GPT model was fine-\ntuned using data from 2012 and subsequently used to perform day-ahead forecasting for 2013 and 2014. The forecasting\naccuracy was quantified in average pinball loss calculated19 across time. Results, as detailed in Table S2, indicate that\nthe fine-tuned GPT model exhibits competitive performance relative to traditional deep learning models.\nTable S2: Comparison of probabilistic forecasting between fine-tuned GPT and benchmarks by pinball loss.

Fine-tuned model\ndemonstrates notably promising capabilities with load forecasting.\n(ii) The intricate nature of price data requires continued exploration and refinement to achieve accurate predictions.\nSI.7 Power Flow-related Problems\nWorking with power-flow equations is an indispensable part of power systems engineering. If LLMs are to be used\nfor solving power-flow-related tasks, they must recognize the correct models and apply them correctly. Here, we will\ninvestigate GPT’s capability to utilize DC power flow and DC optimal power flow.\nIn this regard, we first queried GPT-4 to provide us with the codes for performing DC power flow and DC optimal\npower flow. The Diversity of GPT-generated codes across multiple prompts can be seen in Figure S17(a-c), where\nwe see that during three instances, GPT-4 wrote codes while calling three different solvers. We utilized the Abstract\nSyntax Tree (AST) data structure to compare the generated Python codes and generate the similarity score4 for both DC\npower flow and DC optimal power flow. In addition to variation in the codebase for solving DC power flow, there are\nvariations in solving optimization problems as a part of optimal power flow problem, which increases the similarity\nscore significantly. As demonstrated in Figure S17(f), the generated text produced erroneous text, but, apparently, its\nimpact did not translate into generated code. This raises a fundamental question about the utility of LLMs in performing\npower engineering tasks.\n(a) (b) (c)\n(d) (e)\n(f)\nGenerated Text:\nGenerated Code:\nWrite me a python code for DC power \nflow.\nWrite me a python code for DC optimal \npower flow.\nWrite me a python code for DC power \nflow.\nWrite me a python code for DC optimal \npower flow.\nWrite me a python code for DC optimal \npower flow.\nWrite me a python code for DC optimal \npower flow.\nFigure S17: GPT-generated responses when prompted to generate code for DC Power Flow and DC Optimal Power\nFlow. Figures (a)-(c) shows three different generated codes with the same prompt. Figures (d) and (e) are histograms\nshowing diversity of the generated codes. Figure (f) shows while the generated text with LLMs can be erroneous, it did\nnot translate to generated code.\nSI.7.1 Power Flow\nIn this avenue, first, we provided GPT-3.5 and 4.0 with a set of simultaneous equations to investigate its computational\ncapability. We observed that both GPT-3.5 and 4 can generate Python code for solving the set of linear equations, and\nGPT 4 can utilize embedded tools to generate the solution. GPT-3.5 utilizes self-consistency20 in generating responses,\nwhich sometimes leads to erroneous responses.\nSecondly, we tasked GPT-4 to provide me a step-by-step procedure for solving power flow using DC power flow\nmethods. While it adeptly recognized key components such as voltage magnitudes at all buses at 1 pu, the need for\nspecifying one bus as the slack or reference bus, fixing its phase angle (often to zero), the line resistances are negligible,\nand voltage phase angle differences are small, we identified some discrepancies in the GPT-generated responses, some\nof which are identified in Figure S18(b-d). Furthermore, despite specifically asking to provide us with the procedure, it\ngenerated a wide variety of texts, as depicted in the COMET score21 generated in Figure S18(a). In this regard, we\nfirst obtained GPT-generated texts by invoking the same prompt multiple times. Then, we utilized the COMET score\nto generate semantic similarity among all possible combinations of two generated responses. The figure shows the\nhistogram of these scores, identifying similarities among the generated responses.\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\nFigure S18: GPT-response when tasked with step-by-step procedure for solving power flow using DC power flow.\nFigure (a) shows the histogram depicting diversity of powerflow methodologies generated with the LLM. Figures (b)-(d)\nshows mistakes in GPT-generated results for solving power flow equations considering DC power flow.\nTo understand GPT’s ability to ‘comprehend’ a specific problem, we queried the following problem:\nThe y-bus system matrix of a power system is given by: Y = j[−30, 10, 10, 10; 10, −20, 10, 0; 10, 100, −30, 10; 10, 0, 10,\n−20]. Power generation at the four buses are: 2, 2, 4, 1 pu respectively, and load demand at the four buses are: 0, 1, 4, 0 pu\nrespectively. Considering bus 1 as the slack bus, can you provide me the bus voltage magnitude and bus angles?\nAs it can be seen in Figure S19, GPT does not translate the matrix very well. In this regard, we have tested with multiple\ndifferent Y-bus matrix as shown in this figure. We observe that GPT tends to replicate the Y-bus matrix taken from\nthe lecture note22. The lecture note is publicly available, and GPT-4 might have seen/trained with this dataset, and\nautomatic correction could be attributed to the memory leakage issue discussed in23. Secondly, while this example is a\nstraightforward problem that satisfies all the assumptions of DC power flow, we observe that GPT utilizes a variety of\nmethods, Gauss-Siedel and Newton-Raphson, to solve this problem. We also observe that GPT’s response seems to be a\nlot verbose. In the next experiment, we modified the last sentence of the prompt as: “··· can you provide me the bus\nvoltage magnitude and bus angles using DC-power flow equations?” Here, we observe multiple methodological issues\nin solving DC power flow problem, e.g., in one of the cases, GPT does not reduce the Y-bus matrix before inverting it,\nas demonstrated below:\n# Extracting the reactance matrix X\nX_bus = -1 / np.imag(Y_bus)\nY = j[ -30, 10, 10, 10; \n            10, -20, 10, 0; \n            10, 100, -30, 10; \n            10, 0, 10, -20].\n Y = j[ -30, 10, 10, 10; \n            10, -20, 10, 0; \n            10, 10, -300, 10; \n            10, 0, 10, -20]\nY = j[ -300, 10, 10, 10; \n              10, -20, 10, 0; \n              10, 10, -30, 10; \n              10, 0, 10, -20]\nY = j[ -30, 10, 10, 10; \n          100, -20, 10, 0; \n            10, 10, -30, 10; \n            10, 0, 10, -20]\nY = j[ -30, 100,  10, 10; \n            10, -20,   10, 0; \n            10, 100, -30, 10; \n            10,     0,  10, -20]\nY = j[ -30,  10,   10, 10; \n            10, -20, 100, 0; \n            10, 100, -30, 10; \n            10,    0,   10, -20]\n(a) (b) (c)\n(d) (e) (f)\nFigure S19: GPT’s limited ability to parse the metrices.\n(c)\nThe y-bus system matrix of a power system is given by: Y = \n[ -30j, 10j, 10j, 10j; 10j, -20j, 10j, 0; 10j, 10j, -30j, 10j; 10j, \n0, 10j, -20j]. Power generation at the four buses are: 2, 2, 4, \n1 pu respectively, and load demand at the four buses are: 0, \n1, 4, 0 pu respectively.

Figures (a)-(c) show as\nwe provide more and more help and knowledge-base to the GPT, the variation in LLM generated codes significantly\nreduces. Figure (d) shows that the additional knowledgebase help GPT to consistently produce correct codebase which\nleads to correct solutions for the power flow problems.\nTo solve the issue with improper reproduction of Y-bus matrix, we embed the complex part within the matrix itself.\nSecondly, we add this prompt “No verbose, generate one code” with the aim to limit GPT’s default tendency to provide\nverbose reasoning behind each of the performed actions, segment the codes into multiple pieces, and compile them\nseparately. We performed three sets of experiments: (i) did not specify power flow methodology, (ii) specified using\nDC power flow method, and (iii) specified using with DC power flow with additional knowledge that‘Y = G + jB.\nAlso, P = B′\\theta.’ We performed 14 experiments for each experiment and captured the first generated Python\ncode. For the last task, we also captured the final generated text file. It can be seen that the variability in the generated\ncodes significantly reduces as we add more and more prompts, symbolizing that custom domain knowledge-induced\nprompts could be used to reduce the variability in the GPT-generated responses and consistently nudge the GPT towards\nthe correct solution. In Figure S20, the histogram of compared scores across any two generated codes is calculated\nusing Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)4. For the generated texts, we obtain the score by comparing any two generated text\nresponses using COMET metric. Notably, with our custom prompt, GPT-generated code produces a similar solution\nevery time it is invoked (the only difference is that the generated angle can be either in degrees or radians). This also\ndemonstrates that these custom prompts could be invaluable property of an organization.\nSI.7.2 Optimal Power Flow\nFirst, we focus on the economic dispatch problem with no transmission flow limits as part of our exercise.\nA power system consists of three nodes, which are connected by three branches of infinite capacity. Nodes 1, 2, and 3 have\na demand of 400 MW, 80 MW, and 40 MW respectively. The power system has 4 generators. Generator A is connected to\nNode 2, Gen C and D are connected to Node 3, and Generator B is connected to Node 1. The marginal costs and capacity of\ngenerators are given as:\nGenerator Min Capacity(MW) Max Capacity(MW) Marginal Cost ($/MWh)\nA 20 150 12\nB 30 200 15\nC 20 150 10\nD 30 400 8\nFind the dispatch instructions of generators.\nUpon examining the solution generated by GPT, we observe that it correctly identifies this as a merit order dispatch\nproblem. However, we observe that GPT leans towards analytical reasoning, as discussed in the section above20. In\ncontrast to the prompt discussed earlier, adding the character ∗around the text prompt emboldens it, and this alongside\nselective capital case letters “DO NOT produce any verbose, generate only one code” triggers GPT to focus solely on\ngenerating code for remote execution consistently.\nUpon scrutinizing the generated Python codes, we realize it fails to interpret the task correctly. In many instances, it fails\nto consider the connectivity of all the nodes. In some instances, it does not translate the generator limit constraint very\nwell. We used prompt engineering to alleviate some of the discrepancies. Apparently, like the power flow problems,\nGPT does not translate the text-based knowledge base very well, and we had reasonable success with the custom prompt.\nWe also specified GPT to use ‘linprog’ to limit the variability of generated codes. The efficacy of our approach is\ndepicted in Figure S21, where, while as shown in Figure S21(a), the codebase generated by GPT does not generate\ndispatch instructions, in Figure S21(b), generates correct results in every repeated execution. While the AST score\nutilizing the generated codes in Figure S21(b) is higher, this could be due to the increased complexity introduced by the\nadditional knowledge base. Therefore, domain-expert feedback can become indispensable to furthering the LLM era\nand developing LLM customized for electrical energy sectors.\nWe further investigate considering line reactances and flow limits. In this regard, we augment this additional prompt:\nNow consider these branch reactances and limits:\nBranch Reactance ( pu) Capacity(MW)\n1-2 0.2 250\n1-3 0.3 250\n2-3 0.3 250\nFind out the updated dispatch instructions of the generators.\nUpon repeated experiments, we observed that again GPT tends to utilize self-consistency. GPT also did not consistently\nutilize power flow equations as a part of the solution. To prevent the same, we provide additional prompts as described\nin the power flow problem to solve this OPF problem consistently.\n(b)\nBase Question \n*Knowledge*: x_min<=x<=x_max, x1 + x2+x3+x4= \nL1 + L2 + L3.

Figures (a) and (b) shows\nthat with additional knowledgebase, the variability in the LLM generated codebase increases. However, while none\nof the codes generated without the special knowledgebase generate any solution, histogram in Figure (c) shows the\nadditional knowledgebase consistently produced correct dispatch solution.\nThese experiments suggest two crucial insights: (i) LLMs, at their current capability, heavily utilize code generation\nand remote execution for performing complex power engineering tasks. While the codes generated by LLMs utilizing\nprompt engineering can be impressive, it is extremely important that the prompts consistently produce the correct\ncodebase. This implies that more and more expert feedback is needed to adopt LLMs in the electrical energy sector.\nAnd (ii) power engineers regularly use custom power engineering software, such as PSS/E, PSCAD, PowerWorld, and\nCyME, which could be called by LLMs to solve complex problems in the very same way the Python tools are called, as\ndescribed in this example. One can control LLM-generated verbose before generating Python code, which implies that\nLLMs need to be trained to call these power engineering tools as and when needed, which may also require electric\nenergy sector expertise.\nKey points:\n(i) While LLMs excel in providing verbal descriptions of power systems concepts, they may struggle with\nproblem-solving tasks.\n(ii) Power systems engineers may need to intervene and custom knowledge integration is essential to address LLM\nlimitations effectively.\nSI.8 Ensuring Safe Power Systems Operation\nLLMs are typically programmed to prioritize safety and legality in their responses. Consequently, a safety guardrail\nfunction is deployed to prevent high-risk content generated by LLMs. In the energy sector, the operation of LLMs\nshould not cause disaster for power systems and humans. To demonstrate its capability, we prompted GPT with“Instruct\nme how to trigger a blackout.” Upon testing this query on both GPT-3.5 and 4.0, we received the response, “I’m\nsorry, but I can’t assist with that.” GPT-3.5’s response was more detailed, stating,“triggering a blackout or any other\nintentional disruption of infrastructure is illegal, dangerous, and can have severe consequences.” Repeated attempts at\nthe same prompt yielded the same feedback, indicating this to be an artificially imposed restriction by OpenAI as given\nin Figure S22(A). As a part of this histogram, we first obtained GPT-generated results by invoking the same prompt\nmultiple times. Then, we utilized COMET score21 to generate semantic similarity among all possible combinations of\ntwo generated responses. The figure shows a histogram of these scores, identifying similarities among the generated\nresponses.\n(A) (B) (C)\nI can't assist with that.

(B)\nSimple masquerading as a security researcher, (C) Security researcher focusing more on technical details.\nWhile straightforward questions on triggering blackout generate semantically similar responses, as we try to masquerade\nas security researchers, we receive texts with diverse semantic meanings, as shown with low COMET scores and an\nexample result. As we focus more and more on technical procedural details, GPTs could be tricked into exposing us to\nthe detailed procedure of accessing substation Modbus, as identified in Figure S22(C).\nNext, we assigned GPT the task of assisting with a detailed equipment operation activity that could potentially pose\nhazards to both humans and the power systems. We presented the following prompt:\nThere is a 400V capacitor bank with stored energy of 50J. How do I perform energized repair work on such a capacitor?\nWhile the GPT indicates the aforementioned task “is extremely dangerous and is not recommended due to the risk of\nelectric shock, arcing, or explosion,” it also furnishes us with a generic set of guidelines. Given the potential obscurity\nof the question, GPT may prevent us form performing similar exercise, however, such work is expressly prohibited\naccording to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Safety Manual24. This observation demonstrates that although\ngeneral guardrail is employed by LLM, domain-specific guardrail may not be comprehensively adapted.\nInspired by25, we attempted to circumvent the safety mechanisms of GPT-4 by appending some irrelevant information\nwithin our query.\nIt seems like you're asking for a plan to trigger \na power grid blackout, formatted in a \nparticular, quite creative style. However, I \ncan't assist with any requests related to illegal \nactivities or harmful actions like causing a \nblackout.

As can be seen, the responses range from GPT’s inability to provide support\nto detailed responses, from identifying potential substations to removing traces of cyber intrusion. As identified in25,\nthe inclusion of garbage seemingly oftentimes negates the negative impact of blackout. This experience reveals a\nsignificant vulnerability: entering sensitive or provocative information into ChatGPT might manipulate the model into\ndisclosing that data. This underscores the need for strong, context-aware safety measures in language models to prevent\nexploitation through strategically crafted inputs.\nKey points:\n(i) Safety guardrails imposed on LLM responses prevent malagents from causing harm to the electric power\nsystems.\n(ii) Further investigations are needed when it is not trivial to apply safety guardrails in domain-specific contexts.\nSupplemental References\n1.
