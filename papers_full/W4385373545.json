While recent advancements\nin deep learning models have offered promising results in session-\nbased recommendations [5, 10, 13], established systems like RNN\nbased GRU4Rec + [8] and transformer-based SASRec [ 10] often\nstruggle to maintain accuracy and scalability when dealing with\nlarge item sets. To address these limitations, we introduce TRON, a\nsession-based transformer recommendation system built upon the\noriginal SASRec, that uses top-k negative sampling and a listwise\nloss function to enhance accuracy and training time significantly.\n2 METHODS\n2.1 Negative Sampling\nSession-based recommendation systems predict the next item a user\nwill interact with based on their previous activities within a session.\nA session is a sequence of user-item interactions, represented as\n𝑠 := [𝑖1,𝑖2,...,𝑖 𝑇 −1,𝑖𝑇 ]where 𝑇 is the session length. The items a\nuser has interacted with within a session are considered positive\nsamples, denoted asP(𝑠):=\n𝑇Ð\n𝑘=1\n{𝑖𝑘 }. In contrast, items that the user\nhas not interacted with are called negative samples, represented as\nN𝑠 := I\\P( 𝑠), where Iis the total set of available items.\nTraining a model to perform a next-item prediction across I\nis often unfeasible due to the large size of Iin real-world scenar-\nios. Consequently, a common approach is to train the model to\ndistinguish between positive and negative samples, which can be\nachieved through negative sampling [15]. A major challenge in neg-\native sampling is efficiency. Sampling directly from N𝑠 can be com-\nputationally expensive, as it requires the exclusion of items present\nin P(𝑠). This issue becomes critical when increasing the number\nof negative samples, leading to extended training times [10].\nAn often utilized solution is to sample negatives according to\na uniform distribution UI across the entire set of items I[8].\nThis strategy proves to be effective for large item sets, where the\nprobability of mistakenly sampling a positive item as a negative is\nrelatively small. Another strategy is to sample negatives from the\nempirical frequency FIof item interactions across all users. One\nmethod to efficiently and effectively sample negatives from FI,\nis in-batch negative sampling [9]. This method involves sampling\nnegatives from the batch currently being processed. This is possible\narXiv:2307.14906v2  [cs.IR]  30 Mar 2025\nRecSys ’23, September 18–22, 2023, Singapore, Singapore Timo Wilm, Philipp Normann, Sophie Baumeister, and Paul-Vincent Kobow\nin GRU4Rec because, due to the way a batch is constructed, at\neach time step 𝑡, no other item from the session 𝑠 except 𝑖𝑡 exists\nin the batch. For transformer-based models, such as SASRec, we\nhave developed an efficient solution to employ in-batch negative\nsampling by excluding samples from 𝑠 for batches that include all\nevents of 𝑠.\nIn practice, the combination of negative sampling from bothUI\nand FI often results in enhanced model accuracy [ 8]. This can\nbe achieved by sampling 𝑘 negatives from UIand 𝑚 negatives\nfrom FI. Consider a batch B:= [𝑆1,𝑆2,...,𝑆 𝑏]that consists of 𝑏\nuser sessions. At each time step 𝑡 in each user session 𝑠, we sample\nUN𝑡𝑠 := [𝑈1,𝑈2,...,𝑈 𝑘 ]and FN𝑡𝑠 := [𝐹1,𝐹2,...,𝐹 𝑚], where each\n𝑈𝑖 is a sample from UIand each 𝐹𝑗 is a sample from FI. These\nsamples are then concatenated to form a𝑘+𝑚dimensional random\nvector N𝑡𝑠 := 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑐𝑎𝑡[FN𝑡𝑠,UN𝑡𝑠 ]. The negative samples for the\nentire batch are represented as N.\nThis sampling process can be performed in different ways: el-\nementwise, sessionwise, or batchwise, or a combination of these\nmethods. For the elementwise approach, Nis a tensor of shape\n[𝑏,𝑇,𝑘 +𝑚]because negatives are sampled at each time step for\neach session. In sessionwise sampling, all negatives for a session\nare sampled at once, resulting in a tensor of shape [𝑏,1,𝑘 +𝑚].\nWith batchwise sampling, all negatives for a batch are sampled\nat once, leading to a tensor of shape [1,1,𝑘 +𝑚]. These different\nsampling strategies have a significant impact on the speed of train-\ning. For instance, when a large number of negatives is used, the\ndata transfers between the CPU and GPU can become a bottleneck,\nparticularly with elementwise sampling. Employing sessionwise\nor batchwise sampling can mitigate this issue, allowing the use of\nmore negative samples per time step while maintaining a training\nspeed comparable to that of SASRec. TRON uses a combination of\nuniform batchwise and in-batch sessionwise negative sampling to\nmaintain training speed while improving accuracy.\nTo further optimize the negative sampling process and enhance\nrecommendation performance TRON utilizes a top-k negative\nsampling strategy, which is inspired by a participant’s idea from\nOTTO’s RecSys competition on Kaggle1 and is similar to dynamic\nnegative item sampling [17]. This strategy focuses on updating the\ntop-k negatives during training instead of updating the whole set\nof negative ratings.\nInitially, we sample a set of negative items N𝑡𝑠 and obtain scores\n𝑟𝑡\n𝑠,𝑗 for each item 𝑗 of session 𝑠 at time step 𝑡 in N𝑡𝑠 . Applying the\ntop-k function to the scored items, we select the top-k negatives\nKN𝑡𝑠 := 𝑡𝑜𝑝𝑘([𝑟𝑡\n𝑠,1,𝑟𝑡\n𝑠,2,...,𝑟 𝑡\n𝑠,|N𝑡𝑠 |]). These top-k items are then\nused for updates in the backpropagation step, while the rest are\ndiscarded.\nThis strategy allows us to retain the benefits of a large nega-\ntive sample set, which provides a broader context and helps in\nidentifying harder negatives, while substantially reducing the com-\nputational load during backpropagation. By prioritizing the update\nof negatives that the model currently misranks as likely positives,\nwe enhance the overall speed and accuracy of the recommender\nsystem.\n1https://kaggle.com/competitions/otto-recommender-system/discussion/384022\nTable 1: Statistics of the datasets used in our experiments.\nData\nTrain set Test set\nitemssessions events sessions events\nDiginetica 187k 906k 18k 87k 43k\nYoochoose 7,9M 31,6M 15k 71k 37k\nOTTO 12,9M 194,7M 1,6M 12,3M 1,8M\n2.2 Loss Functions\nFinally, we evaluate pointwise, pairwise, and listwise ranking loss\nfunctions typically used in recommendation systems [4] to further\nenhance model accuracy. The pointwise loss function is binary\ncross-entropy (BCE) [10]. The pairwise loss function is Bayesian\npersonalized ranking max (BPR-MAX) [ 8]. TRON uses sampled\nsoftmax (SSM) [2, 3], a listwise loss function with several benefi-\ncial properties, such as alleviating popularity bias and maximizing\nranking metrics [16].\n3 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP\nIn our evaluation, we assess the performance of our proposed model\nTRON, which is built upon the SASRec architecture, using three\nbenchmark datasets: Diginetica [6], Yoochoose [1], and OTTO [14].\nEach of these datasets presents increasing complexity regarding\nthe number of events and the variety of item sets. We only use click\nevents for our experiments, maintaining a minimum item support\nof five and a session length of at least two for all datasets [8]. We use\na temporal train/test split method, using the last day (Yoochoose\ndataset) or the last week of data (Diginetica and OTTO datasets) to\nform the test sets. The remaining data is used for training. Table 1\nprovides an overview of the datasets used in our experiments.\nRecall@20 and MRR@20 are used as offline metrics [ 9]. We\nperform extensive assessments encompassing all events and items\nwithin the test set to ensure rigorous and dependable evaluations.\nWe prioritize such comprehensive evaluations over sampling-based\napproaches because the latter have shown to be unreliable [11].\nWe use GRU4Rec+ and SASRec as benchmark models. GRU4Rec+\noperates with a hidden size of 100. SASRec is configured with a\nhidden size of 200 across two layers. We introduce modifications\nto SASRec with two variant configurations: one with 512 uniform\nand 16 in-batch sessionwise negatives (SASRec M-Negs) and the\nother with 8192 uniform and 127 in-batch sessionwise negatives\n(SASRec L-Negs). Additionally, SASRec BPR-MAX adopts the BPR-\nMAX loss, while SASRec SSM leverages an SSM loss function, both\nutilizing the same negative sampling strategy as SASRec L-Negs.\nOur proposed models TRON L-Negs and XL-Negs are both based\non the SASRec architecture and use an SSM loss function. TRON\nL-Negs is configured with 8192 batchwise uniform and 127 in-batch\nsessionwise negatives, whereas TRON XL-Negs operates with 16384\nbatchwise uniform negatives and 127 in-batch sessionwise nega-\ntives. Both TRON models use a top-k negative sampling strategy\nonly updating based on the top 100 negative ratings. All models are\ntrained with a batch size of 128 using an NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU.\nScaling Session-Based Transformer Recommendations RecSys ’23, September 18–22, 2023, Singapore, Singapore\nTable 2: Accuracy and training speed using various negative sampling strategies and loss functions. SASRec and TRON models\nwere trained for 100 epochs on Diginetica, and 10 for both Yoochoose and OTTO, while GRU4Rec + was trained for 10 epochs on\nDiginetica, 3 epochs on Yoochoose, and 1 epoch on OTTO.

The GRU4Rec+ model outper-\nforms SASRec across all datasets except MRR@20 on the Diginetica\ndataset. While previous studies on smaller datasets such as Digi-\nnetica indicated SASRec’s superiority over GRU4Rec+[7, 12], our\nfindings on larger datasets and realistic training times do not sup-\nport this claim. This discrepancy could also be attributed to our\nextensive evaluation method, which avoids weaknesses associated\nwith sampling-based evaluations [11] and does not solely rely on\nthe last item of a session. SASRec M-Negs improves the accuracy of\nSASRec for the Diginetica and Yoochoose datasets but shows lower\naccuracy for the OTTO dataset while maintaining SASRec’s original\nspeed. SASRec L-Negs, on the other hand, exhibits slower training\ntimes across all datasets and only improves accuracy on Diginetica.\nThis suggests that using additional negatives in a pointwise loss\nfunction such as BCE negatively impacts the model’s accuracy. SAS-\nRec SSM shows promising results, outperforming GRU4Rec + on\nthe Diginetica dataset and demonstrating competitive accuracy for\nthe other two datasets. Our proposed model TRON shows superior\naccuracy across all datasets except for MRR@20 on the Yoochoose\ndataset while demonstrating faster training times than SASRec SSM\ndue to batchwise and top-k negative sampling. TRON demonstrates\nimproved scalability as the dataset grows larger, as evidenced by\nthe decreasing relative slowdown compared to SASRec. On the\nOTTO dataset, TRON shows an accuracy increase of more than\n6.5% in both Recall@20 and MRR@20, as well as a training speedup\nof 1090% compared to GRU4Rec+. Despite handling more negatives,\nTRON maintains 92% of SASRec’s training speed.\nIn the online experiment, we trained TRON XL-Negs, SASRec\nSSM, and SASRec on a private OTTO dataset from the two most\nrecent weeks using the same preprocessing as described in Section\n3. The Recall@20 for each epoch and model on the test set can\nbe seen in Figure 1. The live improvement of TRON XL-Negs and\nSASRec SSM relative to SASRec measured from May 9 to May 17\n2023 is shown in Figure 2.
