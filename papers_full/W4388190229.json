Memes are multimodal and\noften contain a combination of text and visual elements that convey\nmeaning, humor, and cultural significance. Understanding the top-\nics and themes of memes is important for a variety of applications,\nincluding content moderation, social media analysis, and cultural\nstudies. Although meme analysis has been an active area of research\nfor some time, with studies focusing on various aspects such as\nsentiment analysis [17], semantics [13, 35], abusive content [23, 26],\nand cultural significance [5, 11], there has been little work done on\nunsupervised multimodal topic modeling of memes. This represents\na significant research gap to address, as memes have become an\nessential form of communication, and understanding their topics\nand themes is crucial for various applications.\nA significant challenge in performing unsupervised multimodal\ntopic modeling of memes lies in comprehending the semantic in-\nteraction between the text and visual modalities. For instance, in\nFigure 1, if we consider the superimposed text and image separately,\nthey could be associated with topics such as \"Marriage\" and \"An-\nimals\" respectively. However, when we consider both modalities\ntogether, the appropriate topic should be \"Humor\" or \"Relationship\nHumor\". Hence, it is essential to consider both text and visual ele-\nments together to extract meaningful topics from memes. Despite\nthis, most existing topic modeling techniques are predominantly\ntext-based [37] and are not designed to handle multimodal data.\nResearch Objectives. To address these research gaps, we pro-\npose PromptMTopic1, a novel multimodal prompt-based model\ndesigned to learn topics from both text and visual modalities by\nleveraging the powerful language modeling capabilities of large\n1https://github.com/Social-AI-Studio/PromptMTopic\narXiv:2312.06093v1  [cs.CL]  11 Dec 2023\nMM ’23, October 29-November 3, 2023, Ottawa, ON, Canada Nirmalendu Prakash, Han Wang, Nguyen Khoi Hoang, Ming Shan Hee, & Roy Ka-Wei Lee\nFigure 1: Example of a multimodal meme from FHM dataset.\nlanguage models (LLMs). Specifically, PromptMTopic first utilizes\na visual language model to extract descriptions of the visual aspect\nof the meme. These visual captions are then combined with the\nsuperimposed text extracted from the memes and used as input to\na series of carefully constructed prompts. These prompts guide the\nLLM in identifying and grouping relevant topics in memes.\nContributions. We summarize our contributions as follows:\n•We propose a novel multimodal prompt-based model to per-\nform topic modeling on memes. To the best of our knowl-\nedge, this is the first multimodal topic modeling model that\neffectively extracts and clusters topics learned from memes.\n•We evaluate our proposed model through extensive exper-\niments on three real-world meme datasets. Our automatic\nevaluations demonstrate that our proposed model outper-\nforms the state-of-the-art topic modeling baselines in learn-\ning descriptive topics in memes.\n•We also perform a qualitative analysis of the learned top-\nics and show that our model can identify meaningful and\nculturally relevant topics from memes.\n2 RELATED WORK\n2.1 Multimodal Meme Analysis\nMemes have become an increasingly ubiquitous form of digital\ncommunication, representing an impactful means of online socio-\npolitical engagement [7, 24, 30] and a fundamental component of\ncultural narratives [39]. As such, researchers from various disci-\nplines have attempted to analyze memes to gain insights into the\nsocial, cultural, and political issues that concern online communities.\nSeveral studies have emphasized the importance of interpreting the\ncombined information from different modalities in meme analysis\ndue to their subtle nature [18, 34, 38].\nRecognizing the significance of employing a multimodal ap-\nproach to meme analysis, many studies have released large meme\ndatasets to promote supervised multimodal tasks on memes. For\ninstance, Facebook’s Hateful Memes Challenge [19], designed to\nchallenge unimodal classifiers, encourages the development of new\nmultimodal solutions to detect hate speech in memes [ 6, 14, 15,\n21, 41, 42]. Suryawanshi et al. released the multiOFF dataset and\na multimodal offensive content classifier for memes based on this\ndataset [34]. Additionally, Memotion [31] promotes the analysis\nof visuo-lingual metaphors in memes through sentiment classifica-\ntion and emotion recognition. Among notable studies for this task,\nSESAM [3] emphasizes the challenges in combining images and\ntext, showing that alignment-based and fusion-based strategies do\nnot perform as well as using a single modality.\nNevertheless, most of these existing meme studies have cen-\ntered around performing specific supervised classification tasks.\nFew studies have explored the underlying topics of memes, and\nthose that have are largely limited to the analysis of the textual\nmodality [37]. To address this gap in the literature, we propose an\nunsupervised multimodal topic modeling approach for memes. Our\napproach leverages the combined information from both text and\nimage modalities to automatically discover meaningful underlying\ntopics within memes.\n2.2 Topic Modeling\nTopic modeling is a class of unsupervised machine learning tech-\nniques that aims to discover the underlying themes within a large\ncorpus of text. Each topic is represented by a list of words most\nstrongly associated with it. Traditional models, such as Latent\nDirichlet Allocation (LDA) [ 2] and Non-negative Matrix Factor-\nization (NMF) [10], treat each document as a bag-of-words (BOW)\nand assume it to be a mixture of topics. However, this approach ne-\nglects the semantic relationships between words. Recent advances\nin topic modeling, such as Contextualized Topic Models (CTM) [1]\nand BERTopic [12], incorporate contextual information to provide\nmore nuanced analysis. CTM leverages pre-trained language mod-\nels such as BERT to capture contextual relationships among words,\nwhile BERTopic uses Sentence-BERT (SBERT) [29] to semantically\nembed documents into a vector space for comparative purposes.\nWhile unimodal topic modeling is well-studied, research on mul-\ntimodal topic modeling, which incorporates both image and text\nmodalities, remains limited. Prior studies have often treated visual\nand textual data as separate entities. For example, tr-mmLDA [27]\nlearns separate sets of topics for each modality and uses a regres-\nsion module to predict one set of topics from the other. However,\ngiven the inherent interplay between images and text in memes, it is\ncrucial to jointly model both modalities, as illustrated in Figure 1. In\nour study, we propose a framework that first extracts the semantic\ninformation of the visual modality in a meme and represents this in-\nformation as a textual description (i.e., image captions). The textual\ndescriptions are subsequently combined with the superimposed text\nextracted from the meme to perform topic modeling. By \"flattening\"\nthe meme into a textual representation, we can apply existing topic\nmodeling methods to learn the topics in memes. Nevertheless, our\nproposed approach differs from existing topic modeling methods\nby designing a prompt-based, in-context learning framework that\neffectively utilizes large language models (LLMs) to learn topics\nin memes. We theorize that the vast knowledge accumulated in\nLLMs can potentially enhance the performance of topic modeling,\nyielding more meaningful topic representation.\n3 PRELIMINARIES\n3.1 Problem Definition\nThe problem of multimodal meme topic modeling involves identify-\ning common topics within a collection of memes, using both visual\nPromptMTopic: Unsupervised Multimodal Topic Modeling of Memes using Large Language Models MM ’23, October 29-November 3, 2023, Ottawa, ON, Canada\nGenerate\ndocument-topics\nusing prompts\nFilter\nunique topics\nGroup topics using\nword similarity matching\n(repeat until K topics)\nPromptMTopic - PBM (Prompt-Based Merging)\nPromptMTopic - WSM (Word Similarity Matrix)\n1 2\n3 4\nRetrieve top-10\nrelated words using\nprompts\nGenerate topic-words\nrepresentation using\nc-TF-IDF\nGroup topics\nusing prompts\n(repeat until K Topics)\nGenerate topic-words\nrepresentation using\nc-TF-IDF\nTopic Generation Topic Grouping Topic Representation\n3 4 5\nRetrieve top-10 related\nwords using\nc-TF-IDF scores\n5\nPrompting ChatGPT\nFigure 2: PromptMTopic Model.\nand textual data. The problem can be defined as follows: Given a\ncollection of 𝑛memes 𝐷 = 𝑚1,𝑚2,...,𝑚 𝑛, with each meme𝑚= 𝑖,𝑙\ncomprising an underlying image 𝑖 and superimposed text 𝑙, the\ngoal is to generate the latent topics and their associated concept\nprobabilities. Traditionally, topic modeling techniques compute a\nscore for each meme-topic pair and topic-word pair through matrix\ndecomposition or the computation of statistical distributions.\n3.2 Feature Extraction\nExisting statistical and embedding-based topic modeling techniques\nrequire textual data for matrix decomposition or for the computa-\ntion of statistical distributions. Therefore, to apply these techniques\nto memes, it is necessary to (1) extract the superimposed text 𝑙 and\n(2) convert the image 𝑖 into an acceptable textual representation.\nSuperimposed text can be extracted automatically using existing\nlibraries such as EasyOCR or keras-ocr, or by human annotators.\nRegarding the visual element, a common approach for image-to-\ntext conversion involves representing the image’s semantics with\na textual description, or image captioning . Hence, we cleaned the\nsuperimposed text from the images and input the resulting images\ninto a pre-trained image captioning model. For this task, we used\nthe BLIP-2 model, which has demonstrated its ability to generate\nhigh-quality captions for crowdsourced images by leveraging the\nimplicit knowledge in frozen large language models such as Open\nPre-trained Transformers [40]. Using BLIP-2, we were able to gener-\nate captions that effectively describe the dominant objects or events\ndepicted in the meme’s image.\n4 METHODOLOGY\nOur PromptMTopic model is an unsupervised approach that lever-\nages the strong language understanding capabilities of ChatGPT for\ntopic generation. Recent studies have demonstrated that ChatGPT\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on many natural language\ntasks [20, 32, 33]. Notably, we observed that ChatGPT2 excels at un-\nderstanding informal language, including internet jargon and slang.\nTo perform the topic modeling task with ChatGPT, we designed\ntwo distinct prompts that extract relevant topics and consolidate\na multitude of generated topics into a unique set of themes. Each\nof these prompts is structured as a multi-turn conversation, where\nprior turns serve as task demonstrations that guide the model’s\ngeneration. This process aligns with the concept ofin-context learn-\ning, where large language models are prompted with instructions\nand/or demonstrations to solve new tasks without additional train-\ning [8]. This approach enables the model to learn and perform the\ntask efficiently without the need for fine-tuning. Figure 2 provides\nan overview of our PromptMTopic model, which consists of two\nstages: Topic Generation and Topic Collapse.\n4.1 Topic Generation\nTable 1 shows an example of a prompt for topic generation. To guide\nthe behavior of ChatGPT (“assistant”), we meticulously crafted a\nsystem message that instructs the assistant to identify and extract\nhigh-level topics. Moreover, we instructed the assistant to provide\nonly unique topics and to avoid overly verbose details. We then\nintroduced N conversation turns, containing prompt inputs and\nexpected answers, for the model to comprehend and perform the\ntask. For our experiments, we chose N = 8 conversation turns as\nthere were noticeably fewer hallucinations with this setting. Finally,\nwe fed the prompt input for the new sample and obtained the topics\nfor individual memes.\nHowever, we observed two scenarios where ChatGPT sometimes\nfailed to generate topics. First, ChatGPT may not comprehend the\nsample meme due to unclear or incoherent textual inputs. These\noccurrences are typically because the meme has too few superim-\nposed words, which does not provide enough context for ChatGPT\nto infer from. Second, the content moderation layer in the ChatGPT\nAPI detects inappropriate inputs, such as profanity, and prevents\n2https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions\nMM ’23, October 29-November 3, 2023, Ottawa, ON, Canada Nirmalendu Prakash, Han Wang, Nguyen Khoi Hoang, Ming Shan Hee, & Roy Ka-Wei Lee\nTable 1: Example ChatGPT’s prompt for topic generation\n(reformatted for visualisation purposes).

To address these situations, we\nclassified these memes into “Miscellaneous” and “Inappropriate”\ntopic clusters, respectively.\n4.2 Collapsing Overlapping Topics\nWhile ChatGPT generates multiple high-level topics for individ-\nual memes, many of these topics appear similar and overlap. For\ninstance, topics such as “occupation”, “job search”, “labour” and\n“employment” can be consolidated under the umbrella term “em-\nployment”. To address this issue, we propose two approaches for\ngrouping similar topics: Prompt-Based Matching (PBM) and Word\nSimilarity Matching (WSM) .\nPrompt-Based Matching. To group similar topics from a col-\nlection of memes, we prompt ChatGPT to combine unique topics\nuntil a specified number of topics, denoted by 𝐾, is reached. Ini-\ntially, we sort the unique topics in descending order based on their\nrespective frequency counts, creating the set 𝑇𝑛 = 𝑡1,𝑡2,...,𝑡 𝑛. The\nrationale behind this is that topics with higher occurrence rates\nare likely to be more distinctive. Subsequently, we select the first\nn-1 topics from 𝑇𝑛 to form the set 𝑇𝑛−1 = 𝑡1,𝑡2,...,𝑡 𝑛−1. We then\nprompt ChatGPT to merge the current topic 𝑡𝑛 into a topic within\nthe set 𝑇𝑛−1. If ChatGPT fails to merge 𝑡𝑛 with any of the topics in\n𝑇𝑛−1, we incorporate 𝑡𝑛 into the “Miscellaneous” topic. We repeat\nthis process until we reduce 𝑇𝑛 to the set 𝑡1,𝑡2,...,𝑡 𝐾. See Table 2\nfor an example of a topic grouping prompt.\nTable 2: Example ChatGPT’s prompt for topic collapse(refor-\nmatted for visualisation purposes).

To overcome this,\nwe used a sliding window of M topics from the sorted unique topic\nset and performed topic grouping iteratively. If ChatGPT success-\nfully merged a topic into one of the M topics, we merged the topic\nand restarted the iteration cycle. However, if ChatGPT failed to\nmerge the current topic into any topic in the unique topic list, we\nassigned the topic to a category named “Miscellaneous”.\nWord Similarity Matching . In order to consolidate similar\ntopics into a specified number of unique topics, denoted by 𝐾, we\ncalculate the similarity between pairs of topics.

If a topic has fewer than 20 words, we normalize\nthe number of common words by the smaller word count between\nthe two topics. This way, we identify topics that share common\nwords and phrases, and group them together to form a smaller set\nof unique topics. We can express the topic similarity computation\nusing the following formula:\n𝑇𝑜𝑝𝑖𝑐𝑆𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑙𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑦 (𝑡𝑖,𝑡𝑗)= 𝑡𝑖 ∩𝑡𝑗\nmin(𝑡𝑖,𝑡𝑗) (2)\nwhere t represents a topic, which consists of a bag of topic-\nrelated words. Once we have calculated the topic similarity scores\nfor all possible pairs of topics, we merge the topic pair that has the\nhighest word similarity to form a new topic. We repeat this process\niteratively until only 𝐾 unique topics remain, where 𝐾 represents\nthe desired number of final topics.\n4.3 Topic Representation\nTo evaluate the efficacy of our proposed PromptMTopic model, we\nassess the generated topics using standard topic model metrics, as\ndetailed in Section 5. Evaluation necessitates that topics be rep-\nresented as a word mixture. Given our model did not supply the\nrequired topic-word distributions for selecting the top W repre-\nsentative words, we computed the c-TF-IDF for each cluster and\nemployed two methods to retrieve representative words. In the\nTable 4: Dataset statistics: Size represents the number of\nmemes in each dataset, Caption represents average length of\nBLIP-2 caption per meme, Text represents average length of\nsuperimposed text per meme.\nAvg.

Table\n3 provides an example of the word ranking prompt using ChatGPT.\nUsing these two approaches, we can evaluate the effectiveness\nof our methodology and the coherence of the predicted topics.\n5 EXPERIMENT\n\"In this section, we will discuss various multimodal datasets and\nbaseline topic models. Then, we will present the results of experi-\nments conducted to evaluate the performance of PromptMTopic in\ntopic modeling for multimodal memes, compared to the baseline\nmodels. In addition, we will conduct a qualitative analysis to gain a\ndeeper understanding of the topics generated by PromptMTopic.\n5.1 Experiment Settings\nDatasets. Our experimental analysis involves three publicly avail-\nable meme datasets, each covering diverse contexts:\n•Facebook Hateful Memes (FHM) [18]: FHM is centered around\nsensitive, prejudiced topics that pertain to individuals or groups\nbased on inherent characteristics such as race, religion, and gen-\nder. The identification of these sensitive topics aids in effective\nintervention and prevention.\n•Total Defence Memes (TotalDefMeme) [25]: TotalDefMeme fea-\ntures locally relevant topics related to Singapore’s Total Defence\nconcept, providing valuable insights into the associated events\nand activities.\n•Memotion [28]: Memotion encapsulates viral, widespread topics\non the internet, thereby facilitating a better understanding of\ncurrent online trends.\nEach of these datasets contains superimposed text annotated by\nhuman annotators. Table 4 presents the statistics for each dataset.\nDataset Preprocessing. To prepare the multimodal memes\nfor baseline topic model training and ChatGPT prompting, we\ncarried out a series of feature extraction steps detailed in Section\n3.2. This process often resulted in text and image features containing\nextraneous elements, such as meaningless words, website URLs,\nand usernames. The presence of these elements could negatively\naffect the performance of the baseline topic models. To rectify this,\nwe added an extra preprocessing step, wherewe filtered out stop\nwords, URLs, usernames, and punctuation from the text and image\nMM ’23, October 29-November 3, 2023, Ottawa, ON, Canada Nirmalendu Prakash, Han Wang, Nguyen Khoi Hoang, Ming Shan Hee, & Roy Ka-Wei Lee\nTable 5: Demonstration memes sampled from the FHM dataset, accompanied by their top five topic representation words\ngenerated by BERTopic and PromptMTopic-PBM.

Then, we examined the top 30\nmost frequently occurring words, retaining meaningful terms and\nremoving insignificant ones from both the text and image features.\nFinally, we concatenated the processed image and text features to\nform document features, which were then used to train the baseline\ntopic models.\nCompared Models. We will evaluate PromptMTopic against\nfour well-established and widely used topic modeling models:\n•LDA [2]: LDA is a traditional generative probabilistic model\nthat portrays documents as mixtures of topics. Each topic is\ncharacterized by a distribution over words.\n•NMF [10]: NMF is a non-probabilistic, decompositional model\nthat factorizes a term-document matrix into two lower-ranking,\nnon-negative term-topic and topic-document matrices.\n•CTM [1]: CTM is a neural topic model that leverages language-\nindependent representations to formulate topic distributions.\n•BERTopic [12]: BERTopic uses sentence embedding and cluster-\ning techniques to shape topics and employs a class-based variant\nPromptMTopic: Unsupervised Multimodal Topic Modeling of Memes using Large Language Models MM ’23, October 29-November 3, 2023, Ottawa, ON, Canada\nof TF-IDF to generate topic representations. Unlike the other\nmodels, BERTopic assigns only one topic to each document.\nIn our evaluation of the topic models’ effectiveness, we varied\nthe number of topics ( 𝐾) generated for each dataset. For the To-\ntalDefMeme and Memotion datasets, we trained the baseline topic\nmodels starting with 10 topics, and increased the count in incre-\nments of 10 up to a maximum of 50. For the larger FHM dataset, we\ninitiated with 50 topics and increased the count in increments of 10\nup to a maximum of 100. It should be noted that, under the recom-\nmended configuration, BERTopic produces a maximum of 48 topics\nfor the TotalDefMeme dataset. Similarly, when PromptMTopic-PBM\nis set to generate 50 topics for TotalDefMeme, some topics may end\nup with too few documents, resulting in topic representations of\nfewer than 10 words. Consequently, we have excluded the results\nfor these models when 𝐾 equals 50 topics from the metrics plot.\n5.2 Topic Evaluation\nQuantitative Evaluation. Evaluations of topic modeling often use\ntwo well-established metrics: topic coherence and topic diversity.\nTopic coherence gauges the extent to which the words within a\ntopic are related, forming a coherent group. It is typically calculated\nusing statistics and probabilities drawn from the reference corpus,\nfocusing specifically on the context of the words. In our experi-\nments, we employed Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information\n(NPMI) [4] as our measure of topic coherence3, utilizing a Python\nimplementation provided in a recent study on topic modeling met-\nrics [22]. A higher NPMI score signifies better coherence, with a\nperfect correlation being represented by a score of 1.\nConversely, topic diversity [9] evaluates the proportion of unique\nwords across all topic representations. The diversity score ranges\nfrom 0 to 1, where a score of 0 indicates repetitive topics, and a\nscore of 1 indicates diverse topics. This metric is crucial for en-\nsuring that a topic model covers a wide range of themes without\noveremphasizing any particular topic. Using these two metrics to-\ngether provides insights into the effectiveness of topic modeling\nalgorithms in identifying both coherent and diverse topics.\nFigure 3 depicts the NPMI topic coherence and topic diversity\nscores of topics generated by the various models on the three\ndatasets. We note that PromptMTopic-WSM consistently outper-\nforms other baseline topic models on most datasets across both met-\nrics. Conversely, PromptMTopic-PBM demonstrates performance\ncomparable to some baseline topic models. The strong performance\nof PromptMTopic-WSM suggests that the use of ChatGPT in topic\nmodeling can generate highly coherent and diverse topics.\nQualitative Evaluation. Recent research has suggested that a\nlow NPMI topic coherence score does not necessarily indicate poor\ntopic quality, as the score often exhibits a weak correlation with\nhuman ratings [16]. To further evaluate the quality of the topics\nproduced by the PromptMTopic model, we conducted a manual\nassessment of word coherence within the topics. This provides valu-\nable human-centric insights into the quality of the generated topics.\nSpecifically, we selected a subset of topics from the PromptMTopic-\nPBM model that contained the most documents. Using the names\nof these topics, we retrieved the most relevant topics generated by\nthe PromptMTopic-WSM model and the baseline topic models. To\n3We used 10e-6 for epsilon to prevent the logarithm of zero\nensure a fair comparison among the various models, we set the\nnumber of latent topics for each model based on the dataset: 40\ntopics for the TotalDefMeme and Memotion datasets, and 100 for\nthe FHM dataset. This approach allowed us to carry out objective\nevaluations and comparisons of the various models.\nTable 6 presents the top five words per topic for each model\nacross the three datasets. Despite the PromptMTopic-WSM model’s\nhigher NPMI topic coherence and topic diversity scores, our manual\nassessment surprisingly found the PromptMTopic-PBM model to\nprovide better topic representation; all of its words can be linked to\ntheir corresponding topics. This indicates that using ChatGPT to\nselect topic words can lead to more interpretable topics. This can\nbe attributed to the extensive knowledge and strong language un-\nderstanding encapsulated in large language models (LLMs), which\nenhance topic modeling and topic representation generation.\n5.3 Meme-Topic Analysis\nWhile both automatic and manual evaluations of the models’ gen-\nerated topics have been performed, the ability of these models to\naccurately understand and categorize memes remains uncertain.\nTherefore, we conducted a meme-topic analysis on the FHM dataset\nto evaluate the precision of topic assignment for the memes. Specif-\nically, we scrutinized the BERTopic and PromptMTopic models to\nsee if the related topic words within their assigned topics accurately\nrepresented the meaning of a given meme. Based on our evaluation,\nthe BERTopic model demonstrated significant performance in quan-\ntitative metrics and produced topics mainly consisting of related\ntopic words. On the other hand, the PromptMTopic-PBM model\ndisplayed its strength in the coherence of its generated topics, with\nall the topic words being closely related to the designated topic.\nTable 5 displays three memes from our analysis, along with their\ncorresponding topic words from the BERTopic and PromptMTopic-\nPBM models. We noted that the PromptMTopic-PBM model pro-\nvided more suitable topics for certain memes. For instance, the\nBERTopic model associated the meme depicted in Table 5(a) with a\ntopic that contained racial and gender terms. However, the meme\ndid not contain any offensive or hateful remarks about racial or\ngender issues. Instead, it satirized the political divide between the\nDemocratic and Republican parties. Therefore, although Barack\nObama, being an African-American, could be associated with the\ntopic word \"black, \" the assigned topic did not accurately represent\nthe meme’s intended meaning. Conversely, the PromptMTopic-\nPBM model correctly assigned the topics of \"politics\" and \"finance, \"\nwhich are more relevant to the meme’s content.\nUpon examining another meme in Table 5(b), we found that the\nBERTopic model categorized the meme under a topic containing\npoliticians’ names and the common name \"Michelle. \" While Michelle\nObama, as a former First Lady of the United States, can be linked\nwith politicians, the meme primarily expresses racial hostility to-\nwards her as an African-American woman. Consequently, although\nthe topic contains related terms, they do not convey the meme’s\nintention. On the other hand, we noticed that the PromptMTopic-\nPBM model assigned both an inappropriate topic (\"politics\") and a\nmore suitable topic (\"racism\") to the meme.\nHowever, the PromptMTopic-PBM model, while better at as-\nsigning topics to memes, still struggled with accurately analyzing\nMM ’23, October 29-November 3, 2023, Ottawa, ON, Canada Nirmalendu Prakash, Han Wang, Nguyen Khoi Hoang, Ming Shan Hee, & Roy Ka-Wei Lee\nTable 6: Qualitative evaluation of the topic-words representation. A subset of topics that contains the most number of documents\nare selected from PromptMTopics and its topics’ name is used to manually find the most relevant topics generated by the\nbaseline topic models.

Examining the meme in Table 5(c), we observe clear\nevidence of misogyny, with women treated as objects and means to\nhousehold chores (\"buy one get one free toaster\"). However, both\nthe PromptMTopic-PBM and BERTopic models failed to capture\nthe meme’s intended message and categorized it under inappropri-\nate topics such as \"shopping\" and \"finance. \" This suggests that the\nPromptMTopic and BERTopic models did not fully understand and\ninterpret the memes, highlighting room for future improvements\nin multimodal meme topic modeling.\nIn conclusion, the proposed PromptMTopic model outperformed\nthe baseline topic models. PromptMTopic-WSM achieved the high-\nest NPMI topic coherence and topic diversity scores on most datasets,\nwhile PromptMTopic-PBM generated topics with highly related\nwords and frequently assigned suitable topics to memes.\n6 CONCLUSION\nOur paper introduces an innovative method for multimodal topic\nmodeling on memes. Our approach outperforms well-established\ntopic models across three distinct datasets. A qualitative analysis\nunderscores our method’s ability to discern the nuances and sub-\ntleties in meme content, thereby accurately identifying meaningful\ntopics that existing models might overlook. The originality of our\napproach lies in the concurrent modeling of both meme modalities,\nleveraging the power of LLMs for topic modeling. We believe our\nfindings extend beyond the realm of meme analysis. LLMs have\ndemonstrated potential in a myriad of NLP tasks, and our study fur-\nther illuminates their capability to enhance topic modeling across\nvarious domains. In future research, we plan to explore automated\nfine-tuning for LLMs for multimodal topic modeling.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Federico Bianchi, Simone Terragni, Dirk Hovy, Debora Nozza, and Elisabetta\nFersini. 2020.

In particular, LLMs are susceptible\nto hallucinations and intrinsic biases. While we’ve used demonstra-\ntion examples to alleviate this issue, it nonetheless lingers. Addi-\ntionally, our prompt design process has been manual, suggesting\nthat exploring automatic prompt-tuning could potentially enhance\nperformance. Moreover, the captions produced by BLIP-2 might\nnot always encapsulate the essence of an image and can sometimes\nintroduce unhelpful information to the model. Despite these lim-\nitations, we hope this work serves as a benchmark for assessing\nthe potential of large language models in meme topic analysis and\nspurs further research to overcome these constraints.\nA.2 Topic Modeling using Llama13B[36]\nWe employed Llama13B model to extract topics, on the three datasets.\nWe compare PromptMTopic-WSM using ChatGPT and Llama13B\non coherence and diversity metrics. The results are shown in 4 for\ndifferent k values. We see that using Llama achieves a similar per-\nformance. This indicates the robustness of our proposed framework\nand signifies the potential of replacing LLMs in PromptMTopic with\nmore sophisticated models in the future to improve performance\neven further.\nA.3 Varying the number of demonstration\nexamples\nwe have conducted an experiment to analyze the impact of varying\nthe number of demonstration examples when using ChatGPT and\nLlama13B. We utilized the TotalDefMeme dataset in this ablation\nstudy for the PromptMTopic-WSM framework, for k=20 topics.\nThe number of demonstrations we tested ranged from 2 to 8, with\nincrements of 2. From table 7, we observe that topic coherence and\ndiversity remain comparable for different numbers of examples.\nTable 7: NPMI and Topic Diversity on TDefMeme dataset, us-\ning ChatGPT and Llama, k=20 topics, with different number\nof demonstration examples.\nNPMI Topic Diversity\n#.

Understanding how the\nmodel handles topic collapse while retaining coherence in light of\ndataset variance can provide essential insights into its robustness\nand applicability.\nInterestingly, for PromptMTopic-PBM (prompt-based matching),\nwe find that topic collapsing leads to a tiny fraction of topics, specif-\nically between 1 to 1.6% of the memes, being categorized under\na ’Miscellaneous’ topic. In PromptMTopic-WSM (word similarity\nmatching), we do not have a ‘Miscellaneous’ topic in the merging\nprocess.\nA.5 Cost of PromptMTopic\nThe expense associated with employing ChatGPT for the proposed\napproach is calculated at a rate of $0.002 per 1000 tokens. Consid-\nering a meme dataset size of 10,000, the estimated cost of utilizing\nChatGPT in all three stages of topic modeling, namely topic gen-\neration, topic collapsing, and topic ordering (akin to PromptMTopic-\nPBM), would amount to approximately $20. Conversely, if we choose\nto employ ChatGPT solely for topic generation (similar to\nPromptMTopic-WSM), the estimated cost would be approximately\n$10.\nPromptMTopic: Unsupervised Multimodal Topic Modeling of Memes using Large Language Models MM ’23, October 29-November 3, 2023, Ottawa, ON, Canada\nNPMITopic Diversity\n(a) TotalDefMeme (b) FHM (c) Memotion\nFigure 4: NPMI and Topic Diversity plot for the three datasets for different k values."
