  "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) are reshaping scientific writing. We investigate their applications in physics articles, emphasizing the importance of understanding their impact. Efficient interaction with LLMs offers benefits, yet caution is necessary due to varying outcomes.&#xD;We review concerns surrounding LLMs and emphasize the need for responsible AI use, complementing critical thinking rather than replacing it. Authors and readers are encouraged to experiment with LLMs while upholding ethical standards. EPL prohibits LLMs as authors, requiring authors to declare LLM use and to assume content accuracy.",
