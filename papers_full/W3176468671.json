With the decomposed\nMPO structure, we propose a novel ﬁne-tuning\nstrategy by only updating the parameters from\nthe auxiliary tensors, and design an optimiza-\ntion algorithm for MPO-based approximation\nover stacked network architectures. Our ap-\nproach can be applied to the original or the\ncompressed PLMs in a general way, which\nderives a lighter network and signiﬁcantly re-\nduces the parameters to be ﬁne-tuned. Exten-\nsive experiments have demonstrated the effec-\ntiveness of the proposed approach in model\ncompression, especially the reduction in ﬁne-\ntuning parameters (91% reduction on average).\nThe code to reproduce the results of this pa-\nper can be found at https://github.com/\nRUCAIBox/MPOP.\n1 Introduction\nRecently, pre-trained language models (PLMs) (De-\nvlin et al., 2019; Peters et al., 2018; Radford et al.,\n2018) have made signiﬁcant progress in various\nnatural language processing tasks. Instead of train-\ning a model from scratch, one can ﬁne-tune a PLM\nto solve some speciﬁc task through the paradigm\nof “pre-training and ﬁne-tuning”.\nTypically, PLMs are constructed with stacked\nTransformer layers (Vaswani et al., 2017), involv-\ning a huge number of parameters to be learned.\nThough effective, the large model size makes it im-\npractical for resource-limited devices. Therefore,\nthere is an increasing number of studies focused\n∗Authors contributed equally.\n†Corresponding author.\non the parameter reduction or memory reduction\nof PLMs (Noach and Goldberg, 2020), including\nparameter sharing (Lan et al., 2020), knowledge\ndistillation (Sanh et al., 2019), low-rank approxima-\ntion (Ma et al., 2019) and data quantization (Hubara\net al., 2017). However, these studies mainly apply\nparameter reduction techniques to PLM compres-\nsion, which may not be intrinsically appropriate for\nthe learning paradigm and architecture of PLMs.\nThe compressed parameters are highly coupled so\nthat it is difﬁcult to directly manipulate different\nparts with speciﬁc strategies. For example, most\nPLM compression methods need to ﬁne-tune the\nwhole network architecture, although only a small\nproportion of parameters will signiﬁcantly change\nduring ﬁne-tuning (Liu et al., 2020).\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel matrix prod-\nuct operator (MPO) technique from quantum many-\nbody physics for compressing PLMs (Gao et al.,\n2020). The MPO is an algorithm that factorizes\na matrix into a sequential product of local tensors\n(i.e., a multi way array). Here, we call the tensor\nright in the middle as central tensor and the rest\nas auxiliary tensors. An important merit of the\nMPO decomposition is structural in terms of infor-\nmation distribution: the central tensor with most\nof the parameters encode the core information of\nthe original matrix, while the auxiliary tensors with\nonly a small proportion of parameters play the role\nof complementing the central tensor. Such a prop-\nerty motivates us to investigate whether such an\nMPO can be applied to derive a better PLM com-\npression approach: can we compress the central\ntensor for parameter reduction and update the aux-\niliary tensors for lightweight ﬁne-tuning? If this\ncould be achieved, we can derive a lighter network\nmeanwhile reduce the parameters to be ﬁne-tuned.\nTo this end, we propose an MPO-based com-\npression approach for PLMs, called MPOP. It is\ndeveloped based on the MPO decomposition tech-\n5389\nnique (Gao et al., 2020; Pirvu et al., 2010). We\nhave made two critical technical contributions for\ncompressing PLMs with MPO. First, we introduce\na new ﬁne-tuning strategy that only focuses on the\nparameters of auxiliary tensors, so the number of\nﬁne-tuning parameters can be largely reduced. We\npresent both theoretical analysis and experimental\nveriﬁcation for the effectiveness of the proposed\nﬁne-tuning strategy. Second, we propose a new\noptimization algorithm, called dimension squeez-\ning, tailored for stacked neural layers. Since main-\nstream PLMs usually consist of multiple Trans-\nformer layers, this will produce accumulated re-\nconstruction error by directly applying low-rank\napproximation with MPO at each layer. The di-\nmension squeezing algorithm is able to gradually\nperform the dimension truncation in a more sta-\nble way so that it can dramatically alleviate the\naccumulation error in the stacked architecture.\nTo our knowledge, it is the ﬁrst time that MPO\nis applied to the PLM compression, which is well\nsuited for both the learning paradigm and the archi-\ntecture of PLMs. We construct experiments to eval-\nuate the effectiveness of the proposed compression\napproach for ALBERT, BERT, DistillBERT and\nMobileBERT, respectively, on GLUE benchmark.\nExtensive experiments have demonstrated the ef-\nfectiveness of the proposed approach in model com-\npression, especially dramatically reducing the ﬁne-\ntuning parameters (91% reduction on average).\n2 Related Work\nWe review the related works in three aspects.\nPre-trained Language Model Compression .\nSince the advent of large-scale PLMs, several vari-\nants were proposed to alleviate its memory con-\nsumption. For example, DistilBERT (Sanh et al.,\n2019) and MobileBERT (Sun et al., 2020c) lever-\naged knowledge distillation to reduce the BERT\nnetwork size. SqueezeBERT (Iandola et al., 2020)\nand Q8BERT (Zafrir et al., 2019) adopted special\ntechniques to substitute the operations or quantize\nboth weights and activations. ALBERT (Lan et al.,\n2020) introduced cross-layer parameter sharing and\nlow-rank approximation to reduce the number of\nparameters. More studies (Jiao et al., 2020; Hou\net al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020;\nKhetan and Karnin, 2020; Xin et al., 2020; Pappas\net al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020a) can be found in the\ncomprehensive survey (Ganesh et al., 2020).\nTensor-based Network Compression. Tensor-\nbased methods have been successfully applied to\nneural network compression. For example, MPO\nhas been utilized to compress linear layers of deep\nneural network (Gao et al., 2020). Sun et al.\n(2020b) used MPO to compress the LSTM model\non acoustic data. Novikov et al. (2015) coined\nthe idea of reshaping weights of fully-connected\nlayers into high-dimensional tensors and represent-\ning them in Tensor Train (TT) (Oseledets, 2011)\nformat, which was extended to other network ar-\nchitectures (Garipov et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2017;\nTjandra et al., 2017; Khrulkov et al., 2019). Ma\net al. (2019) adopted block-term tensor decomposi-\ntion to compress Transformer layers in PLMs.\nLightweight Fine-tuning.In the past, lightweight\nﬁne-tuning was performed without considering pa-\nrameter compression. As a typical approach, train-\nable modules are inserted into PLMs. For example,\na “side” network is fused with PLM via summation\nin (Zhang et al., 2020), and adapter-tuning inserts\ntask-speciﬁc layers (adapters) between each layer\nof PLMs (Houlsby et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2020;\nRebufﬁ et al., 2017). On the contrary, several stud-\nies consider removing parameters from PLMs. For\nexample, several model weights are ablated away\nby training a binary parameter mask (Zhao et al.,\n2020; Radiya-Dixit and Wang, 2020).\nOur work is highly built on these studies, while\nwe have a new perspective by designing the PLM\ncompression algorithm, which enables lightweight\nﬁne-tuning. It is the ﬁrst time that MPO is applied\nto PLM compression, and we make two major tech-\nnical contributions for achieving lightweight ﬁne-\ntuning and stable optimization.\n3 Preliminary\nIn this paper, scalars are denoted by lowercase let-\nters (e.g., a), vectors are denoted by boldface low-\nercase letters ( e.g., v), matrices are denoted by\nboldface capital letters (e.g., M), and high-order\n(order three or higher) tensors are denoted by bold-\nface Euler script letters (e.g., T). An n-order tensor\nTi1,i2,...in can be considered as a multidimensional\narray with nindices {i1,i2,...,i n}.\nMatrix Product Operator. Originating from\nquantum many-body physics, matrix product op-\nerator (MPO) is a standard algorithm to factorize\na matrix into a sequential product of multiple lo-\ncal tensors (Gao et al., 2020; Pirvu et al., 2010).\n5390\nMPO\n𝑑!\n𝑑\"\n#\n𝑑$\n𝑑$𝑎$\n𝑎# 𝑑#\n𝑑# 𝑑!𝑎! 𝑎% 𝑎&\n𝑑! 𝑑%\n𝑑%\nTruncate dimension 𝑑# > 𝑑\"\n#\n𝑑!\n𝑑%\n𝑑%\n𝑑$\n𝑑$\n𝑑\"\n#\n𝑀$×&\n𝑎$\n𝑎# 𝑎! 𝑎% 𝑎&\n𝐴$ 𝐴# 𝐴!

Auxiliary tensors ( {Ai}4\ni=1) and central tensor ( C) are marked in blue and orange,\nrespectively. Dash line linking adjacent tensors denotes virtual bonds.\nFormally, given a matrixM ∈RI×J, its MPO de-\ncomposition into a product of nlocal tensors can\nbe represented as:\nMPO (M) =\nn∏\nk=1\nT(k)[dk−1,ik,jk,dk], (1)\nwhere the T(k)[dk−1,ik,jk,dk] is a 4-order tensor\nwith size dk−1 ×ik ×jk ×dk in which ∏n\nk=1 ik =\nI,∏n\nk=1 jk = Jand d0 = dn = 1. We use the con-\ncept of bond to connect two adjacent tensors (Pirvu\net al., 2010). The bond dimension dk is deﬁned by:\ndk = min\n( k∏\nm=1\nim ×jm,\nn∏\nm=k+1\nim ×jm\n)\n. (2)\nFrom Eq. (2), we can see thatdk is going to be large\nin the middle and small on both sides. We present\na detailed algorithm for MPO decomposition in\nAlgorithm 1. In this case, we refer to the tensor\nright in the middle as central tensor, and the rest as\nauxiliary tensor. Figure 1 presents the illustration\nof MPO decomposition, and we use n= 5 in this\npaper.\nAlgorithm 1MPO decomposition for a matrix.\nInput: matrix M, the number of local tensors n\nOutput : MPO tensor list {T(k)}n\nk=1\n1: for k= 1 →n−1 do\n2: M[I,J ] −→M[dk−1 ×ik ×jk,−1]\n3: UλV⊤= SVD (M)\n4: U[dk−1 ×ik ×jk,dk] −→U[dk−1,ik,jk,dk]\n5: T(k) := U\n6: M := λV⊤\n7: end for\n8: T(n) := M\n9: Normalization\n10: return {T(k)}n\nk=1\nMPO-based Low-Rank Approximation. With\nthe standard MPO decomposition in Eq.(1), we can\nexactly reconstruct the original matrix Mthrough\nthe product of the derived local tensors. Follow-\ning (Gao et al., 2020), we can truncate the k-th\nbond dimension dk (see Eq. (1)) of local tensors\nto d′\nk for low-rank approximation: dk > d′\nk. We\ncan set different values for {dk}n\nk=1 to control the\nexpressive capacity of MPO-based reconstruction.\nThe truncation error induced by the k-th bond di-\nmension dk is denoted by ϵk (called local trunca-\ntion error) which can be efﬁciently computed as:\nϵk =\ndk∑\ni=dk−d′\nk\nλi, (3)\nwhere {λi}dk\ni=1 are the singular values of\nM[i1j1...ikjk,ik+1jk+1...injn].\nThen the total truncation error satisﬁes:\n∥M−MPO(M)∥F ≤\n√\nn−1∑\nk=1\nϵ2\nk. (4)\nThe proof can be found in the supplementary ma-\nterials 1. Eq. (1) indicates that the reconstruction\nerror is bounded by the sum of the squared local\ntruncation errors, which is easy to estimate in prac-\ntice.\nSuppose that we have truncated the dimensions\nof local tensors from{dk}n\nk=1 to {d′\nk}n\nk=1, the com-\npression ratio introduced by quantum many-body\nphysics (Gao et al., 2020) can be computed as fol-\nlows:\nρ=\n∑n\nk=1 d′\nk−1ikjkd′\nk∏n\nk=1 ikjk\n.

On\nthe contrary, the larger the compression ratio ρis,\nand the more parameters there are, and the smaller\nthe reconstruction error is. When ρ >1, it indi-\ncates the decomposed tensors have more parame-\nters than the original matrix.\n4 Approach\nSo far, most of pre-trained language models (PLM)\nare developed based on stacked Transformer lay-\ners (Vaswani et al., 2017). Based on such an archi-\ntecture, it has become a paradigm to ﬁrst pre-train\nPLMs and then ﬁne-tunes them on task-speciﬁc\ndata. The involved parameters of PLMs can be\ngenerally represented in the matrix format. Hence,\nit would be natural to apply MPO-based approxi-\nmation for compressing the parameter matrices in\nPLMs by truncating tensor dimensions.\nIn particular, we propose two major improve-\nments for MPO-based PLM compression, which\ncan largely reduce the ﬁne-tuning parameters and\neffectively improve the optimization of stacked ar-\nchitecture, respectively.\n4.1 Lightweight Fine-tuning with Auxiliary\nTensors\nDue to the high coupling of parameters, previous\nPLM compression methods usually need to ﬁne-\ntune all the parameters. As a comparison, the MPO\napproach decomposes a matrix into a list of local\ntensors, which makes it potentially possible to con-\nsider ﬁne-tuning different parts with speciﬁc strate-\ngies. Next, we study how to perform lightweight\nﬁne-tuning based on MPO properties.\nParameter Variation from Pre-Training. To ap-\nply our solution to lightweight ﬁne-tuning, we ﬁrst\nconduct an empirical experiment to check the varia-\ntion degree of the parameters before and after ﬁne-\ntuning. Here, we adopt the standard pre-trained\nBERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and then ﬁne-tune it\non the SST-2 task (Socher et al., 2013). We ﬁrst\ncompute the absolute difference of the variation for\neach parameter value and then compute the ratio\nof parameters with different variation levels. The\nstatistical results are reported in Table 1. As we\ncan see, most of parameters vary little, especially\nfor the word embedding layer. This ﬁnding has\nalso been reported in a previous studies (Khetan\nand Karnin, 2020). As discussed in Section 3, after\nMPO decomposition, the central tensor contains\nthe majority of the parameters, while the auxiliary\ntensors only contain a small proportion of the pa-\nrameters. Such merit inspires us to consider only\nﬁne-tuning the parameters in the auxiliary tensors\nwhile keeping the central tensor ﬁxed during ﬁne-\ntuning. If this approach was feasible, this will\nlargely reduce the parameters to be ﬁne-tuned.\nTheoretical Analysis. Here we introduce entan-\nglement entropy from quantum mechanics (Cal-\nabrese and Cardy, 2004) as the metric to measure\nthe information contained in MPO bonds, which\nis similar to the entropy in information theory but\nreplaces probabilities by normalized singular val-\nues produced by SVD. This will be more suitable\nfor measuring the information of a matrix as sin-\ngular values often correspond to the important in-\nformation implicitly encoded in the matrix, and the\nimportance is positively correlated with the magni-\ntude of the singular values. Following (Calabrese\nand Cardy, 2004), the entanglement entropy Sk\ncorresponding to the k-th bond can be calculated\nby:\nSk = −\ndk∑\nj=1\nvj ln vj, k = 1,2,...,n −1, (6)\nwhere {vj}dk\nj=1 denote the normalized SVD eigen-\nvalues of M[i1j1...ikjk,ik+1jk+1...injn]. The en-\ntanglement entropy Sk is an increasing function\nof dimension dk as described in (Gao et al., 2020).\nBased on Eq. (2), the central tensor has the largest\nbond dimension, corresponding to the largest en-\ntanglement entropy. This indicates that most of\nthe information in an original matrix will be con-\ncentrated in the central tensor. Furthermore, the\nlarger a dimension is, the larger the updating effect\nwill be. According to (Pirvu et al., 2010), it is also\nguaranteed in principle that any change on some\ntensor will be transmitted to the whole local tensor\nset. Thus, it would have almost the same effect\nafter convergence by optimizing the central tensor\nor the auxiliary tensors for PLMs.\nBased on the above analysis, we speculate\n5392\nthat the affected information during ﬁne-tuning is\nmainly encoded on the auxiliary tensors so that\nthe overall variations are small. Therefore, for\nlightweight ﬁne-tuning, we ﬁrst perform the MPO\ndecomposition for a parameter matrix, and then\nonly update its auxiliary tensors according to the\ndownstream task with the central tensor ﬁxed. Ex-\nperimental results in Section 5.2 will demonstrate\nthat such an approach is indeed effective.\n4.2 Dimension Squeezing for Stacked\nArchitecture Optimization\nMost of PLMs are stacked with multiple Trans-\nformer layers. Hence, a major problem with di-\nrectly applying MPO to compressing PLMs is that\nthe reconstruction error tends to be accumulated\nand ampliﬁed exponentially by the number of lay-\ners. It is thus urgent to develop a more stable opti-\nmization algorithm tailored to the stacked architec-\nture.\nFast Reconstruction Error Estimation. Without\nloss of generality, we can consider a simple case\nin which each layer contains exactly one param-\neter matrix to be compressed. Assume that there\nare Llayers, so we have Lparameter matrices in\ntotal, denoted by {M(l)}L\nl=1. Let C(l) denote the\ncorresponding central tensor with a speciﬁc dimen-\nsion d(l) after decomposing M(l) with MPO. Our\nidea is to select a central tensor to reduce its di-\nmension by one at each time, given the selection\ncriterion that this truncation will lead to the least re-\nconstruction error. However, it is time-consuming\nto evaluate the reconstruction error of the original\nmatrix. According to Eq. (3), we can utilize the\nerror bound\n√∑n−1\nk=1 ϵ2\nk for a fast estimation of the\nyielded reconstruction error. In this case, only one\nϵk changes, and it can be efﬁciently computed via\nthe pre-computed eigenvalues.\nFast Performance Gap Computation. At each\ntime, we compute the performance gap before and\nafter the dimension reduction (d(l) →d(l) −1) with\nthe stop criterion. To obtain the performance ˜paf-\nter dimension reduction, we need to ﬁne-tune the\ntruncated model on the downstream task. We can\nalso utilize the lightweight ﬁne-tuning strategy in\nSection 4.1 to obtain ˜pby only tuning the auxil-\niary tensors. If the performance gap ∥p−˜p ∥is\nsmaller than a threshold ∆ or the iteration number\nexceeds the predeﬁned limit, the algorithm will end.\nSuch an optimization algorithm is more stable to\noptimize stacked architectures since it gradually\nreduces the dimension considering the reconstruc-\ntion error and the performance gap. Actually, it\nis similar to the learning of variable matrix prod-\nuct states (Iblisdir et al., 2007) in physics, which\noptimizes the tensors one by one according to the\nsequence. As a comparison, our algorithm dynam-\nically selects the matrix to truncate and is more\nsuitable to PLMs.\nAlgorithm 2 presents a complete procedure for\nour algorithm. In practice, there are usually mul-\ntiple parameter matrices to be optimized at each\nlayer. This can be processed in a similar way: we\nselect some matrices from one layer to optimize\namong all the considered matrices.\nAlgorithm 2Training with dimension squeezing.\nInput: : Llayers with corresponding central tensor C(l) and\ndimension d(l), threshold ∆ and iteration step iter\n1: Evaluate loss p= model(Inputs)\n2: Perform MPO decomposition for each layer\n3: for step= 1 →iterdo\n4: Find the layer ( l∗) with the least reconstruction error\n5: Compress MPO tensor by truncating d(l∗)\n6: Fine-tuning auxiliary tensors with {C(l)}L\nl=1 ﬁxed\n7: Evaluate loss ˜p= model(Inputs)\n8: if ∥p−˜p∥>∆ then\n9: break\n10: end if\n11: end for\n12: return Compressed model\n4.3 Overall Compression Procedure\nGenerally speaking, our approach can compress\nany PLMs with stacked architectures consisting of\nparameter matrices, even the compressed PLMs.\nIn other words, it can work with the existing PLM\ncompression methods to further achieve a better\ncompression performance. Here, we select AL-\nBERT (Lan et al., 2020) as a representative com-\npressed PLM and apply our algorithm to ALBERT.\nThe procedure can be simply summarized as fol-\nlows. First, we obtain the learned ALBERT model\n(complete) and perform the MPO-decomposition to\nthe three major parameter matrices, namely word\nembedding matrix, self-attention matrix and feed-\nforward matrix2. Each matrix will be decomposed\ninto a central tensor and auxiliary tensors. Next,\nwe perform the lightweight ﬁne-tuning to update\nauxiliary tensors until convergence on downstream\ntasks. Then, we apply the dimension squeezing\n2It introduces a parameter sharing mechanism to keep only\none copy for both self-attention and feed-forward matrices.\n5393\nCategory Method Inference Time\nTucker Tucker (d=1) (CP) O(nmd 2 )\nTucker (d> 1) O(nmd + dn )\nMPO MPO (n=2) (SVD) O(2 md3 )\nMPO (n> 2) O(nmd 3 )\nTable 2: Inference time complexities of different low-\nrank approximation methods.

This\nprocess will repeat until the performance gap or the\niteration number exceeds the pre-deﬁned threshold.\nIn this way, we expect that ALBERT can be\nfurther compressed. In particular, it can be ﬁne-\ntuned in a more efﬁcient way, with only a small\namount of parameters to be updated. Section 5.2\nwill demonstrate this.\n4.4 Discussion\nIn mathematics, MPO-based approximation can be\nconsidered as a special low-rank approximation\nmethod. Now, we compare it with other low-rank\napproximation methods, including SVD (Henry\nand Hofrichter, 1992), CPD (Hitchcock, 1927) and\nTucker decomposition (Tucker, 1966).\nWe present the categorization of these methods\nin Table 2. For PLM compression, low-rank decom-\nposition is only performed once, while it repeatedly\nperforms forward propagation computation. Hence,\nwe compare their inference time complexities. In-\ndeed, all the methods can be tensor-based decom-\nposition (i.e., a list of tensors for factorization) or\nmatrix decomposition, and we characterize their\ntime complexities with common parameters. In-\ndeed, MPO and Tucker represent two categories of\nlow-rank approximation methods. Generally, the\nalgorithm capacity is larger with the increase of n\n(more tensors). When n >3, MPO has smaller\ntime complexity than Tucker decomposition. It can\nbe seen that SVD can be considered as a special\ncase of MPO when tensor dimension n = 2 and\nCPD is a special case of Tucker when the core\ntensor is the super-diagonal matrix.\nIn practice, we do not need to strictly follow\nthe original matrix size. Instead, it is easy to pad\nadditional zero entries to enlarge matrix rows or\ncolumns, so that we can obtain different MPO de-\ncomposition results. It has demonstrated that dif-\nferent decomposition plans always lead to almost\nthe same results (Gao et al., 2020). In our exper-\niments, we adopt an odd number of local tensors\nfor MPO decomposition, i.e., ﬁve local tensors (see\nsupplementary materials). Note that MPO decom-\nposition can work with other compression methods:\nit can further reduce the parameters from the matri-\nces compressed by other methods, and meanwhile\nlargely reduce the parameters to be ﬁne-tuned.\n5 Experiments\nIn this section, we ﬁrst set up the experiments, and\nthen report the results and analysis.\n5.1 Experimental Setup\nDatasets. We evaluate the effectiveness of com-\npressing and ﬁne-tuning PLMs of our approach\nMPOP on the General Language Understanding\nEvaluation (GLUE) benchmark (Wang et al., 2019).\nGLUE is a collection of 9 datasets for evaluating\nnatural language understanding systems. Follow-\ning (Sanh et al., 2019), we report macro-score (aver-\nage of individual scores, which is slightly different\nfrom ofﬁcial GLUE score, since Spearman correla-\ntions are reported for STS-B and accuracy scores\nare reported for the other tasks) on the development\nsets for each task by ﬁne-tuning MPOP.\nBaselines. Our baseline methods include:\n•BERT (Devlin et al., 2019): The 12-layer\nBERT-base model was pre-trained on Wikipedia\ncorpus released by Google.\n•ALBERT (Lan et al., 2020): It yields a highly\ncompressed BERT variant with only 11.6M param-\neters, while maintains competitive performance,\nwhich serves as the major baseline.\n•DistilBERT (Sanh et al., 2019): It is trained\nvia knowledge distillation with 6 layers.\n• MobileBERT (Sun et al., 2020c): It is\nequipped with bottleneck structures and a carefully\ndesigned balance between self-attentions and feed-\nforward networks.\nAll these models are released by Huggingface 3.\nWe select these baselines because they are widely\nadopted and have a diverse coverage of compres-\nsion techniques. Note that we do not directly com-\n3https://huggingface.co/\n5394\nExperiments Score SST-2\n(acc)\nMNLI\n(m_cc)\nQNLI\n(acc)\nCoLA\n(mcc)\nSTS-B\n(ρ)\nQQP\n(acc)\nMRPC\n(acc)\nRTE\n(acc)\nWNLI\n(acc)\nAvg.\n#Pr/#To(M)\nALBERTpub - 90.3 81.6 - - - - - - - 11.6/11.6\nALBERTrep 78.9 90.6 84.5 89.4 53.4 88.2 89.1 88.5 71.1 54.9 11.6/11.6\nMPOP 79.7 90.8 83.3 90.5 54.7 89.2 89.4 89.2 73.3 56.3 1.1/9\nMPOPfull 80.3 92.2 84.4 91.4 55.7 89.2 89.6 87.3 76.9 56.3 12.7/12.7\nMPOPfull+LFA 80.4 93.0 84.3 91.3 56.0 89.2 89.0 88.0 78.3 56.3 1.2/12.7\nMPOPdir 68.6 86.6 79.2 81.9 15.0 82.5 87.0 74.3 54.2 56.3 1.1/9\nTable 3: Performance on GLUE benchmark obtained by ﬁne-tuning ALBERT and MPOP. “ALBERT pub” and\n“ALBERTrep” denote the results from the original paper (Lan et al., 2020) and reproduced by ours, respectively.\n“#Pr” and “#To” denote the number (in millions) of pre-trained parameters and total parameters, respectively.\npare our approach with other competitive meth-\nods (Tambe et al., 2020) that require special opti-\nmization tricks or techniques (e.g., hardware-level\noptimization).\nImplementation. The original paper of ALBERT\nonly reported the results of SST-2 and MNLI in\nGLUE. So we reproduce complete results denoted\nas “ALBERTrep” with the Huggingface implemen-\ntation (Wolf et al., 2020). Based on the pre-trained\nparameters provided by Huggingface, we also re-\nproduce the results of BERT, DistilBERT and Mo-\nbileBERT. To ensure a fair comparison, we adopt\nthe same network architecture. For example, the\nnumber of self-attention heads, the hidden dimen-\nsion of embedding vectors, and the max length\nof the input sentence are set to 12, 768 and 128,\nrespectively.\n5.2 Experimental Results\nNote that our focus is to illustrate that our approach\ncan improve either original (uncompressed) or com-\npressed PLMs. In our main experiments, we adopt\nALBERT as the major baseline, and report the com-\nparison results in Table 3.\nComparison with ALBERT. As shown in Table 3,\nour approach MPOP is very competitive in the\nGLUE benchmark, and it outperforms ALBERT in\nall tasks (except MNLI) with a higher overall score\nof 79.7. Looking at the last column, compared with\nALBERT, MPOP reduces total parameters by 22%\n(#To). In particular, it results in a signiﬁcant reduc-\ntion of pre-trained parameters by 91% (#Pr). Such\na reduction is remarkable in lightweight ﬁne-tuning,\nwhich dramatically improves the ﬁne-tuning efﬁ-\nciency. By zooming in on speciﬁc tasks, the im-\nprovements over ALBERT are larger on CoLA,\nRTE and WNLI tasks. An interesting explanation\nis that RTE and WNLI tasks have small training\nsets (fewer than 4ksamples). The lightweight ﬁne-\ntuning strategy seems to work better with limited\ntraining data, which enhances the capacity of PLMs\nand prevents overﬁtting on downstream tasks.\nAblation Results. Our approach has incorporated\ntwo novel improvements: lightweight ﬁne-tuning\nwith auxiliary tensors and optimization with di-\nmension squeezing. We continue to study their\neffect on the ﬁnal performance. Here we con-\nsider three variants for comparison: (1) MPOPfull\nand MPOPfull+LFA are full-rank MPO representa-\ntion (without reconstruction error), and ﬁne-tune\nall the tensors and only auxiliary tensors, respec-\ntively. This comparison is to examine whether\nonly ﬁne-tuning auxiliary tensors would lead to\na performance decrease. (2) MPOPdir directly opti-\nmizes the compressed model without the dimension\nsqueezing algorithm. This variant is used to exam-\nine whether our optimization algorithm is more\nsuitable for stacked architecture. Table 3 (last three\nrows) shows the results when we ablate these. In\nparticular, the dimension squeezing algorithm plays\na key role in improving our approach (a signiﬁcant\nperformance decrease for MPOPdir), since it is tai-\nlored to stacked architecture. Comparing MPOPfull\nwith MPOPfull+LFA, it is noted that ﬁne-tuning all\nthe parameters seems to have a negative effect on\nperformance. Compared with ALBERT, we specu-\nlate that ﬁne-tuning a large model is more likely to\noverﬁt on small datasets (e.g., RTE and MRPC).\nThese results show that our approach is able to\nfurther compress ALBERT with fewer ﬁne-tuning\nparameters. Especially, it is also helpful to improve\nthe capacity and robustness of PLMs.\n5.3 Detailed Analysis\nIn this section, we perform a series of detailed\nanalysis experiments for our approach.\nEvaluation with Other BERT Variants. In gen-\neral, our approach can be applied to either uncom-\n5395\nModels WNLI\n(acc)\nMRPC\n(acc)\nRTE\n(acc)\nAvg.\n#Pr/#To(M)\nBERT 56.3 85.5 70.0 110/110\nMPOPB 56.3 84.3 70.8 7.7/70.4\nDistilBERT 56.3 84.1 61.4 66/66\nMPOPD 56.3 84.3 61.7 4.0/43.4\nMobileBERT 56.2 86.0 63.5 25.3/25.3\nMPOPM 56.2 85.3 65.7 4.4/15.4\nTable 4: Evaluation with different BERT variants.\npressed or compressed PLMs. We have evaluated\nits performance with ALBERT. Now, we continue\nto test it with other BERT variants, namely origi-\nnal BERT, DistilBERT and MobileBERT. The lat-\nter two BERT variants are knowledge distillation\nbased methods, and the distilled models can also be\nrepresented in the format of parameter matrix. We\napply our approach to the three variants. Table 4\npresents the comparison of the three variants before\nand after the application of MPOP. As we can see,\nour approach can substantially reduce the network\nparameters, especially the parameters to be ﬁne-\ntuned. Note that DistilBERT and MobileBERT are\nhighly compressed models. These results show that\nour approach can further improve other compressed\nPLMs.\nEvaluation on Different Fine-Tuning Strategies.\nExperiments have shown that our approach is able\nto largely reduce the number of parameters to\nbe ﬁne-tuned. Here we consider a more simple\nmethod to reduce the ﬁne-tuning parameters, i.e.,\nonly ﬁne-tune the last layers of BERT. This experi-\nment reuses the settings of BERT (12 layers) and\nour approach on BERT (i.e., MPOPB in Table 4).\nWe ﬁne-tune the last 1-3 layers of BERT, and com-\npare the performance with our approach MPOPB.\nFrom Table 5, we can see that such a simple way is\nmuch worse than our approach, especially on the\nRTE task. Our approach provides a more princi-\npled way for lightweight ﬁne-tuning. By updating\nauxiliary tensors, it can better adapt to task-speciﬁc\nloss, and thus achieve better performance.\nEvaluation on Low-Rank Approximation. As\nintroduced in Section 4.4, MPO is a special low-\nrank approximation method, and we ﬁrst com-\npare its compression capacity with other low-rank\napproximation methods. As shown in Table 2,\nMPO and Tucker decomposition represent two\nmain categories of low-rank approximation meth-\nods. We select CPD (Henry and Hofrichter, 1992)\nModels SST-2 MRPC RTE Avg.\n#Pr(M)\nBERT10−12 91.9 76.5 67.2 45.7\nBERT11−12 91.7 75.3 62.8 38.6\nBERT12 91.4 72.1 61.4 31.5\nMPOPB 92.6 84.3 70.8 10.1\nTable 5: Comparison of different ﬁne-tuning strategies\non three GLUE tasks.

(5)) and y-axis denotes the reconstruction error,\nmeasured in the Frobenius norm.\nfor comparison because general Tucker decompo-\nsition (Tucker, 1966) cannot obtain results with\nreasonable memory. Our evaluation task is to com-\npress the word embedding matrix of the released\n“bert-base-uncased” model4. As shown in Fig-\nure 2(a), MPO achieves a smaller reconstruction\nerror with all compression ratios, which shows that\nMPO is superior to CPD. Another hyper-parameter\nin our MPO decomposition is the number of lo-\ncal tensors ( n). We further perform the same\nevaluation with different numbers of local tensors\n(n= 3,5,7). From Figure 2(b), it can be observed\nthat our method is relatively stable with respect to\nthe number of local tensors. Overall, a larger nre-\nquires a higher time complexity and can yield ﬂexi-\nble decomposition. Thus, we set n= 5 for making\na trade-off between ﬂexibility and efﬁciency.\n6 Conclusion\nWe proposed an MPO-based PLM compression\nmethod. With MPO decomposition, we were able\nto reorganize and aggregate information in central\ntensors effectively. Inspired by this, we designed a\nnovel ﬁne-tuning strategy that only needs to ﬁne-\ntune the parameters in auxiliary tensors. We also\ndeveloped a dimension squeezing training algo-\nrithm for optimizing low-rank approximation over\n4https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased\n5396\nstacked network architectures. Extensive experi-\nments had demonstrated the effectiveness of our\napproach, especially on the reduction of ﬁne-tuning\nparameters. We also empirically found that such\na ﬁne-tuning way was more robust to generalize\non small training datasets. To our knowledge, it is\nthe ﬁrst time that MPO decomposition had been\napplied to compress PLMs. In future work, we will\nconsider exploring more decomposition structures\nfor MPO.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was partially supported by the National\nNatural Science Foundation of China under Grants\nNo. 61872369, 61832017 and 11934020, Bei-\njing Academy of Artiﬁcial Intelligence (BAAI) un-\nder Grant No. BAAI2020ZJ0301, Beijing Out-\nstanding Young Scientist Program under Grant\nNo. BJJWZYJH012019100020098, the Funda-\nmental Research Funds for the Central Universities\nand the Research Funds of Renmin University of\nChina under Grant No. 18XNLG22, 19XNQ047,\n20XNLG19 and 21XNH027.
