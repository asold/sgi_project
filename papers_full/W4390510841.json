Intrinsically disordered proteins and \nregions (IDPs/IDRs) are a special class of proteins or \nregions that exist without stable fold structures under \nnative physiologic conditions. Despite lacking well-\ndefined tertiary structures, IDPs/IDRs play essential \n*Correspondence:\nBin Liu\nbliu@bliulab.net\n1 School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Institute \nof Technology, No. 5, South Zhongguancun Street, Beijing, Haidian \nDistrict 100081, China\n2 Advanced Research Institute of Multidisciplinary Science, Beijing \nInstitute of Technology, No. 5, South Zhongguancun Street, Beijing, \nHaidian District 100081, China\nPage 2 of 15Pang and Liu  BMC Biology            (2024) 22:3 \nroles in a wide range of biological processes, such as cell \nsignaling [1], DNA regulation [2], and post-translational \nmodification [3]. IDP/IDRs are also associated with many \nhuman diseases [4], including neurodegenerative disease \n[5, 6], diabetes [7], cancer [1, 8], and cardiovascular dis -\nease [9, 10]. The flexibility of IDRs in their structures ena-\nbles them to bind many molecular ligands, thus making \nthem effective drug targets [11]. Therefore, identifying \ndisordered regions in proteins and understanding their \nfunctional roles will contribute to rational drug design \nand improve the efficiency of new drug development [12, \n13].\nExperimental characterization of IDPs/IDRs in the \nwet lab is expensive and labor-intensive. With the mas -\nsive growth in the number of protein sequences avail -\nable in databases [14], computationally predicting IDP/\nIDRs directly from sequences is considered a feasible \napproach. Numerous computational methods by lever -\naging different sequence features and computing tech -\nniques have been developed for identifying IDRs in \nproteins, such as SPOT-disorder [15], DISOPRED3 [16], \nSPINE-D [17], AUCpreD [18], IDP-Seq2seq [19], SPOT-\nDisorder2 [20], and fIDPnn. Their predictive qualities \nwere comprehensively evaluated by a community-driven \nCritical Assessment of protein Intrinsic Disorder (CAID) \n[21]. The first edition of CAID (CAID1) [21] evaluated \na total of 32 disorder predictors, and the second round \nof CAID (CAID2) [22, 23] was recently completed and \ninvolved the evaluations of a total of 46 different compu -\ntational methods.\nIDP/IDRs perform multiple critical functions in living \norganisms [24]. These functions can be broadly classified \ninto two categories: the binding functions that arise from \ninteracting with partners and the non-binding functions \nthat originate from their native structural flexibility [24, \n25]. Many computational predictive methods have been \ndeveloped focusing on binding regions in IDRs, including \nmethods for identifying protein-binding sites [26–31], \nDNA-binding sites [26, 29, 30], RNA-binding sites [26, \n29, 30], and lipid-binding sites [32]. There are several \npredictors [33–35] available for identifying the molecu -\nlar recognition features (MoRFs) within IDRs, which are \ndisordered regions that bind to target protein domains in \na process known as disorder-to-order transition. Linker \nserves as the primary function of the non-binding cate -\ngory, playing a critical role in linking multiple structured \ndomains and permitting domain movements between \ncatalytic sites [36, 37]. Methods [38–40] for identifying \ndisordered flexible linkers (DFLs) from protein sequences \nhave been developed. Besides, a single IDR in proteins is \nable to bind with different ligands to perform multiple \nfunctions, and several prediction tools such as DisoRD -\nPbind [29] and DeepDISOBind [30] have been designed \nto provide predictions for multiple types of disordered \nbinding regions, including IDRs involved in protein \nbinding, DNA binding, and RNA binding. fIDPnn [26] \nis an available method for predicting both the binding \nand non-binding functions of IDRs. Due to the previous \nefforts in disorder functional prediction, the CAID1 has \nincluded the assessment of disordered binding regions \n[21], and the recent CAID2 has extended the evalua -\ntion to the prediction of disordered linkers [22, 23]. As \nthe results indicated by CAID, there still exists substan -\ntial room for improvement in the current predictors. \n(1) Insufficient coverage of functional predictions: IDRs \nperform multiple functions, and predictors covering \nmore functional categories are required. (2) The multiple \nfunctions of intrinsically disordered proteins/regions are \ndependent and interrelated; the current methods do not \ntake into account the functional correlations, leading to \nlow predictive accuracy.\nThe biological sequences and natural languages share \nthree hierarchical levels of similarities. (1) Genetic \nsimilarity: the language ability in biological organisms, \nincluding humans, is involved in specific genes [41]. \nBoth the origin of language and the evolution of biologi -\ncal species stem from genetic inheritance and variation. \n(2) Evolutionary similarity: biological organisms and \nnatural languages share similar mechanisms of evolution. \nNatural language is an exclusive characteristic of human \nbeings, and both the development of language and the \nevolution of species are directed by natural selection [42]. \n(3) Formal similarity: biological sequences exhibit simi -\nlar arrangement rules and combination patterns to those \nobserved in natural languages [43], for example, the fre -\nquency of occurrence of words in language and domains \nin proteome following the same form of Zipf’s law [44]. \nThese similarities fundamentally ensure the efficacy of \napplying natural language processing (NLP) techniques \nin the analysis of biological sequences [45–47]. The pro -\ntein language model (PLM) stands out as one of the most \nrepresentative approaches [48–50]. Its capability to cap -\nture semantic information of protein sequence, structure, \nand function [51] has demonstrated significant potential \nin a series of studies, including protein design [52–54] \nand protein function prediction [55]. In this study, we \ninvestigated how to incorporate the protein semantic \nknowledge to facilitate computational predictions of dis -\nordered regions and their functions.\nHere, we describe a computational method for jointly \npredicting disorder and multiple disordered functions, \ntermed DisoFLAG. The DisoFLAG employs a graph-\nbased interaction protein language model (GiPLM) to \nprovide six functional predictions for the intrinsic dis -\norder, including protein-binding, DNA-binding, RNA-\nbinding, ion-binding, lipid-binding, and flexible linker \nPage 3 of 15\nPang and Liu  BMC Biology            (2024) 22:3 \n \n(see Fig.  1a). The GiPLM integrates the protein seman -\ntic information obtained from pre-trained protein lan -\nguage model into graph-based interaction units. The \ngraph-based interaction unit models the multiple dis -\nordered functions as a graph to learn the semantic cor -\nrelation features among different disordered functions. \nThen, the propensity scores for disorder and six func -\ntions were calculated based on the semantic correlation \nfeatures aggregated by the graph convolutional network \n(GCN) layer (see Fig.  1b). Following the CAID, we per -\nformed evaluations of DisoFLAG on the CAID2 dataset \nFig. 1 Schematic overview of DisoFLAG. a DisoFLAG provides predictions of six functions for intrinsically disordered regions in proteins. Joint \nprediction of the six functional regions results in a lower information entropy compared to individual prediction. The reduction in information \nentropy is known as information gain (IG), which reflects the correlation between different functions. High IG, strong correlation. b The graph-based \ninteraction protein language model (GiPLM) architecture employed in DisoFLAG. The bi-directional gated recurrent unit (Bi-GRU) layer is used \nto capture the protein contextual semantic information based on the residue embeddings extracted from the pre-trained protein language \nmodel. The subsequent attention-based gated recurrent unit (GRU) layer is used to model the global correlation among sequences and produces \na hidden representation for each residue. The feature mapping layers are used to generate six different function embedding vectors  (Xi) for each \nresidue. Subsequently, for each residue, the graph-based interaction unit models six functions and their correlations as a functional graph, \nutilizing function embedding vectors  (Xi) as node representations and pre-calculated IG matrix as the weighted adjacency matrix for graph edges. \nFinally, the propensity scores for disorder and six disordered functions were calculated based on the semantic correlation features aggregated \non the functional graph by the graph convolutional network (GCN) layer\nand two independent test datasets built from the latest \nDisProt database. The evaluation results demonstrated \nthat DisoFLAG achieves relatively higher performance \nin predicting disorder and disordered functions. We \nprovide a standalone package and a convenient web \nserver for DisoFLAG.\nMethods\nBenchmark dataset of disorder functions\nThe DisProt [56–58] database provided the functional \nannotations of intrinsically disordered protein/region \nPage 4 of 15Pang and Liu  BMC Biology            (2024) 22:3 \n(IDP/IDR) following the Intrinsically Disordered Proteins \nOntology (IDPO) and the Gene Ontology (GO) schemas. \nWe investigated all the ontology terms in DisProt and \nobtained functional annotation term collections for pro -\ntein-, DNA-, RNA-, ion-, and lipid-binding and flexible \nlinker (Additional file  1: Table  S1). Following previous \nstudies [ 21, 29, 59], we annotated each functional class \nby collecting all the sub-terms. We extracted all the func-\ntionally annotated proteins from the DisProt9.3 data -\nbase. To obtain high-quality data, we removed sequences \nwhose functional regions lacked annotations for disor -\ndered structure. We also excluded the DP00072 sequence \nthat was too long (>  30,000 residues) to be processed by \nthe protein language model. Subsequently, a total of 925 \nsequences were obtained and used for splitting the train -\ning, validation, and independent test datasets. Following \nthe same protocols as previous studies [ 26, 32], we clus -\ntered the 925 sequences using the CD-HIT algorithm \n[60] with 25% sequence similarity. Then, we randomly \ndivided the clusters into five subsets, where three sub -\nsets (including 589 sequences) were used as the training \ndataset, and one subset (including 148 sequences) was \nused as the validation dataset. The remaining subset with \n188 sequences was used as the independent test dataset, \nnamely DP93. To further evaluate the performance of the \nproposed predictor, we collected an additional independ-\nent test dataset (DP94) containing 98 sequences using \nthe same protocol as aforementioned. The sequences of \nDP94 are collected from the newly updated proteins in \nversions 9.3 to 9.4 of the DisProt database. The statisti -\ncal information of these datasets is shown in Additional \nfile 1: Table S2.\nGraph‑based interaction protein language model\nMotivated by the language models (LMs) in natural lan -\nguage processing (NLP) [ 61, 62], the protein language \nmodels (PLMs) pre-trained with large numbers of amino \nacid sequences are able to discover the basic principles \ncontained in the sequences [ 63]. Studies [55, 64, 65] have \ndemonstrated that applying protein semantic informa -\ntion extracted from PLMs can facilitate the performance \nimprovement of various prediction tasks. In DisoFLAG, \nwe employed a graph-based interaction protein language \nmodel (GiPLM) to provide six functional predictions for \nintrinsically disordered regions (see Fig.  1b). The GiPLM \nintegrates protein semantic information extracted from \nthe ProtT5 [ 64] protein language model into graph-\nbased interaction units to enhance the semantic cor -\nrelation of multiple disordered functions. Specifically, a \nbidirectional gated recurrent neural network (Bi-GRU) \n[66] layer is employed to capture the protein contextual \nsemantic encodings P based on the embeddings extracted \nfrom the ProtT5:\nwhere ri is the PLM embedding vector for the ith resi -\ndue, and L represents the length of the input sequence. \nSubsequently, the gate recurrent unit (GRU) layer with an \nattention mechanism [19, 67] was utilized to capture the \nglobal correlations among sequences and output the hid -\nden representation hi for each residue:\nwhere pj ∈ P indicates the semantic encodings of the \njth residue, Wa is the trainable weights of the atten -\ntion mechanism, sij the attention score between the ith \nand the jth residues, αij represents the attention weight \nbetween the ith and the jth residues, and ci indicates the \nattention-based contextual representations. Then, the \nfeature mapping layers were used to generate the func -\ntional semantic representations ( X) for each residue. \nSpecifically, six fully connected layers were employed for \nmapping the hidden global correlation representation hi \nas functional semantic representations:\nwhere X(n )\ni  is the nth functional semantic representation \nfor the ith residue and W(n) and b(n) are weights and bias \nvariables, respectively; ReLU is the nonlinear activation \nfunction.\nA single disordered region can bind to different ligands \nto perform multiple functions, and the multiple functions \nof IDRs are dependent and interrelated. In this study, \nwe used the Shannon information entropy (IE) [ 68] and \ninformation gain (IG) [ 69] to describe the correlations \namong different functions:\nwhere HX∪Y and HXY represent the information required \nfor individual prediction and joint prediction of X and Y \nfunctions, respectively [68]:\n(1)P = BiGRU (r1,r2,··· ,rL]\n(2)hi = GRU (hi−1,ci )\n(3)ci =\nl\nj=1 αij pj\n(4)α ij = exp(sij)\n∑l\nj=1exp(sij)\n(5)sij = hT\ni−1 W a pj\n(6)X(n )\ni = ReLU\n(\nhiW (n ) + b(n )\n)\n(7)IGXY = HX∪Y − HXY (0 ≤ IG< 1)\n(8)H X ∪Y =−\n∑\ni∈X ∪Y p(i)log2 p(i)\nPage 5 of 15\nPang and Liu  BMC Biology            (2024) 22:3 \n \nA higher IG value indicates more reductions of IE \nin the joint prediction of two functions and a stronger \ncorrelation between the two functions. We pre-cal -\nculated the IG values on the training dataset and \nobtained the IG matrix of six disordered functions, \nwhich is visualized in Additional file 1 : Fig. S1.\nThen, each graph-based interaction unit in GiPLM \nmodels six disordered functions and their correlations \nas a functional graph G = (V, E), where V  and E  rep -\nresent nodes and edges, respectively. The functional \ngraph is fully connected (see Fig.  1b). Each node rep -\nresents a function and is represented by functional \nsemantic representation X(i) . Edges represent the cor -\nrelations between functions and are represented by the \nadjacency matrix. In GiPLM, we employed a trainable \nweighted adjacency matrix to represent the degree of \ncorrelation between different functions and used the \nIG matrix pre-calculated on the training dataset by \nformula (7 ) as the initialization value:\nThen, the graph convolutional network (GCN) layer \nwas used to propagate and aggregate the semantic cor -\nrelation features for each node on the functional graph \n[70]:\nwhere Y(n)\ni  is the aggregated semantic feature of the nth \nfunctional node, A is the trainable weighted adjacency \nmatrix of the edges, Xi =[ X1\ni ,X2\ni ,··· ,X6\ni ] is the concat -\nenation of the six functional semantic representations, \nW(n)′ is the convolution kernel, and ReLU is the nonlin -\near activation function. The semantic feature of the disor-\nder YIDR\ni  was obtained by performing global max pooling \nover the functional graph (F represents the dimension of \nnode features) [71]:\nFinally, the propensity scores for disorder and six \ndisordered functions were calculated based on the \nfunctional node features Y(1)∼(6)\ni  and disordered fea -\ntures YIDR\ni  by seven fully connected layers with the Sig -\nmoid activation functions [32, 59].\nModel training and evaluation\nTo train the GiPLM model of DisoFLAG to predict disor-\nder and disordered functions for proteins, we employed \nthe binary cross-entropy loss function to calculate the \n(9)H XY =−\n∑\ni∈X\n∑\nj∈Y p\n(\nij\n)\nlog2 p\n(\nij\n)\n(10)A ij= IG ij\n(11)Y(n)\ni = ReLU(\n∑\nj∈N i\nAijW (n)′Xi + b(n)′)\n(12)YIDR\ni = max k∈F ([Y(1)\ni ,··· Y(n)\ni ··· ,Y(6)\ni ])\nloss value of each prediction, and their combination was \nused as the final loss L(θ ) [72]:\nwhere yi (1 or 0) and ˆyi represent the trues and predicted \npropensity score of the ith function, respectively.

A detailed description of all the train -\nable parameters and hyper-parameters of DisoFLAG was \ngiven in Additional file 1: Table S3.\nThe DisoFLAG outputs the real-valued propensity \nscore results for disorder and disordered functions. We \nevaluated the predictive performances of DisoFLAG and \nother comparative methods with threshold-independ -\nent metrics [73–77]: AUC (area under the true-positive \nrates and false-positive rates curve across all thresh -\nolds), AUPR (area under the precisions and recalls curve \nacross all thresholds), APS (average precision score \nalong the precision-recall curve), and Fmax (the maxi -\nmum harmonic mean between precision and recall rate \nacross all thresholds). In addition, given a threshold, the \nbinary results can be converted from the real-valued \nresults (residue is predicted to be disordered/functional \nif its propensity score is higher than the threshold; oth -\nerwise, it is predicted as ordered/non-functional). We \nused the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) and \nbalanced accuracy (BACC) to evaluate the binary predic -\ntion results. The definitions of the evaluation metrics are \ngiven in Additional file 1: Table S4.\nResults and discussion\nProtein semantic information facilitates the prediction \nof intrinsic disorder and disordered function\nProtein feature representation is an essential step in Dis -\noFLAG. We evaluated the performance of DisoFLAG \nusing different protein representations, including protein \nlanguage model-based (PLM) features (ProtT5 and Prot -\nBERT), the position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM), and \namino acid one-hot encodings (One-hot). Models taking \ndifferent feature inputs were trained and optimized fol -\nlowing the same protocol as described in the “Methods” \nsection. The evaluation results on the DP93 independent \ntest dataset and corresponding ranking results are shown \nin Fig.  2a and Additional file  1: Table  S5, respectively. \nFrom these results, we can see that the model using PLM-\nbased features outperformed PSSM and One-hot, and \nthe model using ProtT5 consistently achieved the high -\nest performance in predicting disorder and disordered \nfunctions.

Specifically, for each sequence in \nthe DP93 dataset, we employed the HHblits [80] tools to \nconduct homology searches against the UniProt database \nand grouped the sequences according to the number of \nrows in the MSA search results. The results on disor -\nder (Fig.  2b) and disordered functions (Fig.  2c–e) dem-\nonstrated that the performance of the model using the \nFig. 2 Performance of DisoFLAG in predicting disorder and disordered functions using different feature representations. a AUC value \ncomparisons of DisoFLAG using different features, including protein language model-based features (ProtT5 and ProtBERT) and classic protein \nfeature representations by position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) and amino acid one-hot encodings (One-hot).

When the MSA depth is relatively \nsmall, the PSSM encoding method has better results than \nthe protein language model coding method. The possible \nreasons for these results were attributed to the following: \n(1) The PLM as a data-driven deep learning method can \naccurately capture sequence features only when there is \na sufficient number of homologous sequences available. \n(2) In contrast, PSSM encoding based on a probabilistic \nstatistical model is more effective in capturing sequence \nfeatures under a lower MSA depth condition. (3) The \nfeatures captured by PSSM encoding and PLM are differ -\nent. PSSM is designed to encode sequence conservation \ninformation, while PLM learns the contextual semantic \ninformation of protein sequences. Therefore, the con -\nservation information is more accurate than the seman -\ntic information in predicting disordered functions when \nthere are fewer homologous sequences.\nGraph‑based interaction unit enhances the semantic \ncorrelations of multiple disordered functions\nThe graph-based interaction unit (GiU) in DisoFLAG \nwas employed to establish the correlations among mul -\ntiple disordered functions. To investigate the critical role \nof GiU in DisoFLAG, we compared the performance of \nDisoFLAG using GiU with a simple sequence layer (Seq) \n(see Table  1). From this table, we found that DisoFLAG \nusing GiU consistently outperformed the Seq, indicating \nthat the semantic correlation features captured by GiU \nsignificantly boosted the predictive performance of Diso -\nFLAG. In addition, the correlation among different dis -\nordered functions leads to one disordered residue being \nable to perform two or more different functions, which is \nreferred to as the multifunctional (MF) residue. We com-\npared DisoFLAG with other methods for predicting MF \nresidues on the DP93 test dataset. A multifunctional resi-\ndue is considered correctly predicted only if all its func -\ntions are accurately predicted. The Fmax evaluation results \nof different methods are shown in Fig.  3a, from which we \nfound that there are six types of MF residues in the DP93 \ndataset. DisoFLAG is the only predictor that can predict \nall types of MF residues. Additionally, compared to other \npredictors, DisoFLAG considered correlations among \ndifferent functions and achieved the highest F max values, \nwhich again indicated the importance of functional cor -\nrelations captured by GiU for the accurate prediction of \ndisordered functions.\nFurthermore, we used layer-wise relevance propaga -\ntion (LRP) [81, 82] to investigate the contributions of \nfunctional correlations to the prediction results. The LRP \nscore was calculated as follows:\nwhere R(l)\nj  and R(l+1)\nk  are the relevance scores of the cur -\nrent and previous layers, respectively. α and β are the \nconstraint parameters of the αβ rule in LRP; w jk , bk , \nand h j represent the weights, bias, and hidden vector, \nrespectively. We performed the LRP on the graph-based \ninteraction units to obtain the importance of functional \ncorrelations. For each function, the importance scores \nof functional correlations to the propensity score were \ncalculated by summing the relevance scores of all true-\npositive propensity predictions on the DP93 test dataset, \nwhich were described in Eq. (14).

DisoFLAG is cur -\nrently the only predictor providing predictions of \nion-binding IDRs and covering the broadest range of \ndisordered functional categories. The evaluation results \non the DP93 test dataset suggested that the perfor -\nmance of DisoFLAG in predicting disordered protein-\nbinding, DNA-binding, RNA-binding, lipid-binding, \nand linkers is better than the current tools quantified \nby AUC, MCC, and BACC metrics (Table  2). Moreover, \nDisoFLAG offered statistically significant improvement \nin AUC compared to other methods (see Additional \nfile  1: Table  S6). To further investigate the stability of \nthe prediction performance of different methods, we \nperformed the performance comparison on the DP94 \ntest dataset, whose proteins were collected from the \nlatest version 9.4 DisProt database. The results show \nthat the performance quantified by the AUC metric of \nDisoFLAG is still significantly better than current tools \nin predicting disordered protein-binding, DNA-bind -\ning, and linkers; however, its performance decreased in \npredicting RNA-binding and lipid-bindings (see Addi -\ntional file  1: Tables S7 and S8). We also reported the \nperformance metrics at the protein level, as described \nin Additional file 1 : Tables S9 and S10.\nWe compared DisoFLAG with a broad range of pre -\ndictors that participated in the Critical Assessment of \nprotein Intrinsic Disorder (CAID2) challenge. Specifi -\ncally, we assessed the performance of DisoFLAG on two \nCAID2 test datasets: disorder-binding and disorder-\nlinker [22, 23]. The disorder-binding dataset contains 78 \nproteins annotated with interaction interfaces in disor -\ndered regions, and the disorder-linker dataset contains 40 \nproteins with disordered flexible linkers. We comprehen-\nsively aligned the sequences in CAID2 with all the bench-\nmark datasets used in this study and found that CAID2 \nsequences were completely unseen with the training and \nvalidation of DisoFLAG. This is fully consistent with the \nassessment process of CAID2. Therefore, it is appropri -\nate to directly compare the results of DisoFLAG with \nthose reported in CAID2. We assessed the performance \nof DisoFLAG for predicting protein-binding, DNA-bind -\ning, RNA-binding, ion-binding, and lipid-binding on the \ndisorder-binding dataset and predicting linkers on the \ndisorder-linker dataset. The evaluation results and com -\nparison with the 10 top-ranking methods reported in \nCAID2 [22, 23] are shown in Fig.  4.

The complete \nmetrics are listed in Additional file 1: Tables S11 and S12.\nComparison of DisoFLAG to other methods \nin the prediction of intrinsic disorder\nWe assessed the performance of DisoFLAG in predict -\ning the intrinsic disorder of proteins on two disordered \ntest datasets provided in CAID2: DisProt-NOX and \nDisProt-PDB. The DisProt-NOX dataset is composed of \nIDRs from the DisProt database, excluding X-ray miss -\ning residues. In contrast, the DisProt-PDB dataset is \nmore conservative by strictly limiting negative samples \nto structured residues observed in the PDB database. \nFor more detailed information about the datasets, please \nrefer to the CAID2 [22, 23]. We performed a thorough \nsequence comparison of two CAID2 datasets against the \nbenchmark dataset used in this study to ensure that all \nsequences were independent and unseen by the training \nand validation of DisoFLAG. Subsequently, we compared \nthe performance of DisoFLAG with the top 10 ranked \nmethods reported in CAID2 (see Fig.  5). From these \nresults, we observed that DisoFLAG achieved a second \nrank with an AUC of 0.836 and a fourth rank with an \nAPS of 0.560 on the Disorder-NOX dataset. DisoFLAG \nshowed lower performance on the Disorder-PDB dataset, \nbut it achieved comparable performance to the CAID2 \ntop 10 results in terms of AUC and APS metrics. The \ncomplete metrics are in Additional file  1: Tables S13 and \nS14.\nCase study\nWe investigated the prediction results of DisoFLAG for \none protein from the independent test data: the human \nimmunodeficiency virus infectivity factor (HIV-1 Vif, \nDisProt: DP00875). Vif is a crucial accessory protein in \nHIV replication, and its role is to disrupt the antiviral \nactivity of the human host defense factor APOBEC-3G \n(A3G) [83]. The functional implementation of Vif involves \ninteractions with A3G, protein chaperones, ubiquitina -\ntion machinery factors, and so on [84, 85]. Thus, eluci -\ndating the functional mechanism of Vif is of significant \nimportance for discovering novel drugs to block its activ -\nity [85–87]. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) revealed \nFig. 4 Performance comparisons of DisoFLAG and the 10 top-ranking methods in CAID2 for disordered binding and linker prediction. The receiver \noperating characteristic (ROC) curves on the disorder-binding and disorder-linker predictions are shown in a and c, respectively; methods are sorted \nby the area under the ROC cover (AUC). The precision-recall (PR) curves on the disorder-binding and disorder-linker predictions are shown in b \nand d, respectively; methods are sorted by the average precision score (APS); and points correspond to the Fmax values. “C” represents the coverage \nof prediction results\nPage 11 of 15\nPang and Liu  BMC Biology            (2024) 22:3 \n \nthat the C-terminal domain (141–192) of Vif is unstruc -\ntured under physiological conditions. Figure  6a shows a \nprotein complex structure (PDB ID: 8E40) [88] composed \nof Vif from the PDB database [89]. Experimental evidence \nsuggests that the disordered region of Vif is involved in \nbinding with proteins and lipids [90]. The propensity \nscores for the Vif protein produced by DisoFLAG are \nvisualized in Fig.  6b. To investigate the contribution of \nfunctional correlations to the DisoFLAG’s predictions, \nwe mapped the highest protein-binding propensity score \nlocated at the T170 residue onto the functional graph \nin DisoFLAG. The mapping process achieved by LRP is \nshown in Fig.  6c, from which we observed that protein-\nbinding, RNA-binding, and lipid-binding nodes made \na positive contribution to the prediction, and the edge \nbetween the protein-binding node and lipid-binding \nnode contributed the most. We further compared the \nbinary results of protein-binding and lipid-binding pre -\ndicted by DisoFLAG and other methods for the Vif pro -\ntein. From the comparison results shown in Fig.  6d, e, it \ncan be seen that DisoFLAG is the only method that can \nsimultaneously identify the complete disordered pro -\ntein-binding and lipid-binding regions of the Vif protein \nand has the lowest number of false-positive predictions. \nThese results highlighted again the semantic correlations \ncaptured through the graph-based interaction protein \nlanguage model (GiPLM) enabling DisoFLAG to provide \naccurate and comprehensive predictions of multiple dis -\nordered functions.\nConclusions\nInspired by the similarities between biological sequences \nand natural language across three hierarchical levels, \nwe designed the DisoFLAG predictor based on a graph-\nbased interaction protein language model. DisoFLAG \nprovides predictions of intrinsic disorder and its six types \nof functions, including protein-binding, DNA-binding, \nRNA-binding, ion-binding, lipid-binding, and flexible \nlinkers. The performance assessments performed on two \nindependent test datasets and CIAD2 benchmark test \ndatasets indicated that DisoFLAG offers accurate and \ncomprehensive predictions of disordered functions, \nextending the current coverage of computationally \npredicted disordered function categories. Our experi -\nmental analysis of the prediction results of DisoFLAG \ndemonstrated that the use of protein semantic knowledge \nFig. 5 Performance comparisons of DisoFLAG and the 10 top-ranking methods in CAID2 for disorder prediction.
