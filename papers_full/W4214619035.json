Introduction\nControlling is a phenomenon of the present, which \nwe have known since the end of the last century, but \nin the new millennium, it received a new direction \nand content. Controlling is a modern efficient \nmanagement tool aimed at helping the company \nachieve its goals [1].   \nDOI: 10.18421/TEM111-45 \nhttps://doi.org/10.18421/TEM111-45 \nCorresponding author: Katarína Čulková,  \nTechnical University of Košice, Letná 9, Košice, Slovakia \nEmail: Katarina.culkova@tuke.sk \nReceived:   24 November 2021. \nRevised:     07 February 2022. \nAccepted:   12 February 2022. \nPublished:  28 February 2022. \n© 2022 Adriana Csikósová, Katarína Čulková \n& \nMária Janošková; published by UIKTEN. This work is \nlicensed  under  the  Creative  Commons  Attribution‐\nNonCommercial‐NoDerivs 4.0 License.\nThe  article  is  published  with  Open  Access  at \nhttps://www.temjournal.com/ \nIts task is to prevent possible surprises, timely \nanticipation of possible problems and take the \nnecessary measures to reduce any negative \nphenomena.  \nIt is a specific job of eva luating information. The \ntask of controlling is not only process management; \nhowever mainly company-wide management with \nthe use of obtained informa tion about real processes. \nA necessity for controlling employees is not only \nknowledge of the whole company as a whole, but \nalso its components [2].\n The task of controlling is not \nonly the evaluation of already performed events, but \nalso anticipation, finding the most suitable direction \nto achieve business goals. Controlling is a set of \nspecific tasks that are necessary and need to be \ncompleted. It is therefore essential to distinguish \nbetween the controlling function and the controller - \nthe person who is the holder of the controlling \nfunction [3].\n  Controlling is also the main task of \nmanagement. Every manage r also remembers the \nfunction of controlling [4].   There is no controller \nfunction in small and medi um-sized enterprises; \nsomeone usually performs these tasks from the \ncompany's management or the head of the financial \naccounting department. The independent function of \na controller exists in companies with up to about two \nhundred employees. He then takes over a \nresponsibility for controlling tasks within the \ncompany. At present, controlling means a method of \nthriving business or managing success. Controlling is \nthen effective and efficient if the organization \nachieves the goals it has set [5].\n This is no longer \npossible today without the digitization of \nmanagement processes [6].    \nThe aim of the paper is to examine the position and \nbenefits of controlling in  small and medium-sized \nenterprises (SMEs) in a selected region of Slovakia, \nin order to find opportunities to increase \neffectiveness of this type of business. Small and \nmedium-sized enterprises a re an important part of a \nwide range of companies in most countries in the \nworld. In the countries of the Organization for \nEconomic Co-operation a nd Development (OECD) \nthey represent more than 95% of the total number of \nall enterprises, with their share in employment \n\nTEM Journal. Volume 11, Issue 1, pages 356‐366, ISSN 2217‐8309, DOI: 10.18421/TEM111‐45, February 2022. \nTEM Journal – Volume 11 / Number  1 / 2022.                                                                                                                            357 \naveraging around 75% and their share in GDP up to \n80%. In the Slovak Republic, the quantitative share \nof small and medium-sized enterprises is comparable \nto developed countries, while their share in \nemployment is on average more than 70%. The small \nand medium-sized enterprise sector in Slovakia \ncontributes to the creation of GDP by the volume of \nits production approximately 3/5 of the total \nproduction volume.  \n \n2. Present State of Problem Solving  \n \nOpinions on controlling are not uniform in what \nexactly a given concept should express and what all \ncontrolling should be interested in [7]. Together with \naudit and benchmarking, controlling means a tool for \nthe risk management [8]. According to Morales and \nPezet (2012), controlling contributes also to the \nimproving of the financial situation of the business \n[9].   \nIn the most general sense of the word, we \nunderstand controlling as a method that aims to \nincrease the effectiveness of the management system \nby constantly comparing the actual state of the \nbusiness process with the desired state, then \nevaluating deviations and updating goals [10]. \nBhosekar and Vyas (2012) state that the general \ndefinition of the concept of controlling itself takes \nplace at three basic levels, namely [11]:  \n \n Controlling as a business philosophy presents \nprimarily on a theoretical level. It is a change of \nthinking in the field of business management, \nwhich consists of basic integrated parts - \nplanning, production, finance and marketing. \nThese activities enter into a system of business \norganization, which first acts as a business entity \nin the sum of these parts.  \n We understand controlling as a system of rules \nthat helps to achieve the company's goals, \nprevents surprises and warns us in time of the \ndangers that require the  implementation of \nappropriate management measures.  \n  Controlling as a company management project is \na set of created elements and links, which by their \nmanifestation fulfill the principles of the \ncontrolling system, i.e. that there are such means \nin the company that really take care of \nmaintaining the desired state.  \n \nControlling is the result of cooperation between the \ncontroller and the manager, contributing to the \nincreasing of the business efficiency [12]. The \nprocess of setting goals, management and planning in \nthe financial and performance area, we call \ncontrolling [13], [14], [15], [16]. Every company, \nregardless the size, shoul d use controlling as a \nmanagerial activity. Gonos et al. (2016) use \ncontrolling as a process in industrial companies, \nhelping implementation a nd realization of the \nbusiness plan [17]. Controlling is a set of rules for \nachieving goals that serve to maintain the desired \nstate and make a profit.  \nControlling facilitates coordination in management, \nimproves the management of the company's system, \nits tools facilitate control in various areas of \nresponsibility. According to Písař and Bílková (2019), \ncontrolling serves to mainta in the desired state in \nSMEs through innovation using [18].  \nControlling is a management tool whose task is to \ncoordinate the planning, control and provision of an \ninformation database in order to work to improve \nbusiness and financial results [19].  \nWhen defining the term controlling, we come \nacross two important facts. The first is the fact that \ncontrolling is a practical r ather than a theoretical \ndiscipline [20]. Due to its nature, it was difficult to \ndeal with controlling in the academic environment \n[21]. It can even be stated that no set of academic \nknowledge has been establis hed on which scientists \ncould base the definition of controlling [22]. The \nsecond fact is the understanding of controlling, which \nis different in Anglo-Saxo n countries  from those in \nGerman-speaking countri es. There are several \nimportant definitions of controlling in the available \nliterature and in this concept; it has several meanings \nand various annotations [23].   \nIn the Anglo-American sci ence of management, it \nrepresents controlling in addition to planning, \norganizing main management function. An essential \nrole of management is to manage the company as a \nsystem and gain control over it. The term controlling \ncame to Europe for the first time after the Second \nWorld War, while controllers appeared almost \nexclusively in subsidiaries of American companies. In \nthe mid-1970s, a decline in sales also added to the \nconsumer goods markets. All this brought to the \nforefront of interest for  E u r o p e  a t  t h a t  t i m e  a  \nrelatively new, but  faste r expanding position of a \ncontroller. In 1974, almost 90% of the largest German \ncompanies already had controlling in their \norganizational structure. The German professional \nliterature has the institutional definitions of the term \nto expand from a purely functional point of view. \nIndividual authors descri be the controller as an \nauxiliary instance, which provides its own holders \nwith functions of controlling,  management, services. \nOther authors believe that t he controller itself is a \ncontrolling function [24]. It remains common for both \nworlds that, as in German controlling and managerial \naccounting, the importance of information for the \nmanagement and decision-making of the company's \nmanagement is emphasized, primarily financial \ninformation.  \nTEM Journal. Volume 11, Issue 1, pages 356‐366, ISSN 2217‐8309, DOI: 10.18421/TEM111‐45, February 2022. \n358                                                                                                                          TEM Journal – Volume 11 / Number 1 / 2022. \nDue to the non-existence of a corresponding term \nwith the same meaning and content, the professional \nGerman literature included the word controlling in \nGerman. Controlling began to reach European \ncountries, and especially Germany, only with the \ngradual influx of American companies and their \nbranches. During the 60's, German companies were \nprovided with the introduc tion of controlling, in the \n70's, larger companies began to create jobs, \nrespectively separate controlling units [25]. The main \nguideline is within the scope of control theory. \nControlling attributes secondary guidance, the task of \nwhich is to guide and manage the activities of \nspecialized subsystems in the control system and to \nprovide information, consisting of the following \nsubsystems: value, planning, control, information, \norganizational and personnel management system.  \nKruml et al. (2015) and Mundy (2010) deals with \ncontrolling as one of the most important approaches \nof business management with possibilities for \ninterconnection with process management, especially \nin SME's [26], [27]. According to Schmiedel et al. \n(2014) despite a common unde rstanding that culture \ni s  a n  i m p o r t a n t  e l e m e n t  i n  B P M  e f f o r t s ,  t h e r e  i s  a  \ndearth of theoretical and empirical research on culture \nas a facilitator of successful BPM [28]. IT and BPM \nsystems is at most the aspect of Business Process \nManagement. In fact, Busi ness Process Management \n(BPM) is a comprehensive system for managing and \ntransforming organizational operations [29].  \nAccording to Eldridge et al. (2013), controlling tools \nhelp the organizations mak ing business in uncertain \nenvironment through formal and informal control \nsystems [30]. \n \nSeveral authors studied controlling tools used in \ndifferent industrial sectors, as for example [31] in \narea of gas transportation, [32] in business with \ninsurance, [33] in telecommunication area, [34] in \nlogistic area and [35] in manufacturing companies. \nNumber of authors studies use of controlling tools in \nsmall enterprises. For example, Gottlieb et al. (2021) \nstudied small family firms in area of farm business, \nfinding negative state of small enterprises using \ncontrol practices [36]. Heinicke (2018) researched \npossible use of controlling to performance \nmeasurement systems in SMEs, finding it is still \nscarce and indicating SMEs may benefit from the use \nof sophisticated control systems [37]. Senftlechner \nand Hiebl (2015) made a comprehensive review of \nempirical literature on use of controlling tools in \nSMEs, finding in past decade the academic interest in \nthis area increased and management accounting and \ncontrol seem to be generally less relevant to family \nbusinesses than to non-family businesses. Presented \nreview show there is a little research of the \ncontrolling tools using from the regional view, when \nresults of the presented paper provide the possible \napproach.  \n3. Methodology \n \nBased on a review of the literature, through the \nsystematic and detailed processing of individual \nknowledge in the field of controlling, which follows \neach other, the main goal is to examine the use of \ncontrolling and its tools in managing business \nprocesses, finding out the reasons for possible non-\nuse in small and medium-sized enterprises. To meet \nthe main goal, we have set the following sub-goals:  \n \n1. Examine different appro aches to understanding, \ntime dimensions of controlling and position in the \nmanagement process, controlling tools in \ndifferent phases.  \n2. Analyze small and medium-sized enterprises; \nverify the methods and use of controlling in small \nand medium-sized enterprises of the selected \nregion based on the implementation of own \nresearch [38].    \n3. E v a l u a t e  t h e  r e s u l t s  o f  r e s e a r c h  a n d  d r a f t  \nrecommendations for companies in the selected \nsector.  \n \nTo achieve the main one, the paper is a survey \nthrough a questionnaire survey with selected research \nquestions. Hypotheses:  \n \n H1: We assume that a separate position of a \ncontroller exists in all companies with a foreign \nownership structure.  \n H2: We assume that more than 50% of small and \nmedium-sized enterprises use controlling tools in \ncorporate management.  \n H3: We assume that the application of controlling \nand its tools is more a matter of medium-sized \nenterprises than small enterprises.  \n H4: We assume that small and medium-sized \nenterprises in the chosen region focus mainly on \nfinancial indicators in corporate governance.  \n H5: We assume that the main problems in \nintroducing controlling into the management of \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises are the lack \nof qualified staff and insufficient knowledge of \nthis modern management system.  \n \nThe questionnaire survey took place in the months \nof November 2020 to February 2021. The research \nhold through an online questionnaire using the \nSurvio web application. The research focused on the \nuse of controlling tools in small and medium-sized \nenterprises in the Prešov region, the questionnaire \nsurvey addressed 200 enterprises that have their \nregistered office in the Prešov region. We sent the \nquestionnaire by e-mail to the addresses of the \nstatutory offices or to the economic departments of \nthe companies addressed. Out of the total number of \ncompanies contacted, 23 companies responded to the \nquestionnaire and participated in the research.

Small and medium-sized enterprises have \nthe highest representation in the Prešov region. \nEnterprises with up to 49 employees represent more \nthan 97% of the total number of enterprises. Large \ncompanies with 250 or more employees make up less \nthan 1% of the total. Small and medium-sized \nenterprises (SMEs) in Slovakia began only after 1990 \nwith the coming privatization of state property. Small \nand medium-sized enterprises are showing a sharp \nincrease, also due to the following factors:  \n \n Disintegration of state-owned enterprises;  \n Return of confiscated property to citizens within \nthe framework of restitutions;  \n Market liberalization, demand for goods and \nservices, inflow of foreign capital.  \n \nAs of 31 December 2019, 77,942 active business \nentities belonging to the category of small and \nmedium-sized enterprises (including micro-\nenterprises) registered in the register of organizations \nof the Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic in the \nPrešov region. Of interest is their dynamic year-on-\ny e a r  i n c r e a s e  o f  8 . 0 % .  I n  the Prešov region, micro-\nenterprises form the mos t numerous size categories \nwith 97.4% of the total number of active business \nentities. Small and medium-sized enterprises \nrepresented in the Prešov region by only 2.6%. 21.8% \nof all small and medium-s ized enterprises in the \nPrešov region are concentrat ed in the Prešov District \nand 13.6% in the Poprad District. The District of \nPrešov presents a center of business activities based \non the number of active business entities. Low \nnumbers of small and medium-sized enterprises are in \nthe districts of Medzilaborce (1.0%), Stropkov (2.4%) \nand Levoča (3.4%).  \nThe questionnaire consisted of two parts. In the \nfirst part, we focused on finding out the basic data \nabout the company, such as the legal form of \nbusiness, the number of emp loyees, the focus of the \nindustry and the length of existence of the company. \nIn the questionnaire survey, we focused on the \ncategory of small and medium -sized enterprises that \nhave their headquarters a nd perform their business \nactivities in the Prešov region. Therefore, in the \nfollowing Table 1 we divided the individual \ncompanies that participated in the questionnaire \nsurvey. Such a division of enterprises based on the \ncriteria for the classification and categorization of \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises. Seventeen small \nenterprises and 6 medium-s ized enterprises from the \nPrešov region responded to the questionnaire and \nparticipated in the survey. The basic criterion for this \ndivision was the number of employees in individual \ncompanies (Table 1). \n \nTable 1. Review of researched enterprises according to the \nvolume \n \nEnterprise Small Medium Total \nNumber 17 6 23 \n% rate 73.91 26.09 100.00 \nAverage employees \nnumber 27 63 - \nProduction business 14 6 20 \nNon-productive \nbusiness 3 0 3 \n \nLimited-liability companies participated in the \nlargest share of the questionnaire survey, specifically \nwith the number of 16, which in total represents a \nvalue of less than 70%. Four joint-stock companies \nand three self-employed persons also took part in the \nsurvey. Other forms of business did not participate in \nthe questionnaire survey. In  terms of the sectoral \nstructure of the surveyed companies, three business \nentities, with a percentage value of 13%, were from \nthe nonmanufacturing sector. Twenty companies \ncarry out their business activities in the \nmanufacturing sector. Nonmanufacturing included \none privately employed person, one joint-stock \ncompany and 1 limited liability company. We can \nconclude that companie s engaged in production \nactivities are more interested in controlling. \nCompanies that have been operating on the market \nfor a longer period of more than 10 years, namely 11 \ncompanies, which represents 47.82%, hold the \nlargest share of the addressed companies. Other \ncompanies are represented in the same way, with a \nnumber of six and a percentage value of 26.09. \n \n4. Results  \n \nAs for the research of controlling state worldwide, \nwe made the research using the database of the \ncompany Controller - Institute and Contrast \nConsulting Prague in Czec h and Slovak companies. \nSuch a database was chosen deliberately, given the \nnature of the problem and the narrowly defined \nquestionnaire survey, which assumed the existence of \na controlling department in the surveyed companies, \nwhich this database guarantees. The recipients of the \nresearch were the heads of the controlling \ndepartments of these com panies. Total number of \n748 companies received the questionnaire. Only 59 \ncompleted questionnaires returned, of which only 56 \nTEM Journal. Volume 11, Issue 1, pages 356‐366, ISSN 2217‐8309, DOI: 10.18421/TEM111‐45, February 2022. \n360                                                                                                                          TEM Journal – Volume 11 / Number 1 / 2022. \nquestionnaires were suitabl e for evaluation. The \nreturn rate of the questionnaires thus represented less \nthan 8%. In general, this return is as quite low, \nmainly due to the narrow focus and \"sensitivity\" of \nthe data. If we compare this return with similar \nresearch carried out in the field of controlling in the \nCzech Republic, Germany and Austria, the achieved \nreturn will start to appear in a slightly different light. \nController - The Institute reports a maximum return \nof 10% for similar research. Returns on the \nperformed research in the field of controlling in \nGerman-speaking countries in the years 1976 – 1993 \nranged from 7% to 47%. However, these researches \nwere much more general.  \nThe following concepts are most often used in the \npractice of Czech and Slovak companies as systems \nfor measuring business process performance: \nBalanced Scorecard (BSC), Activity Based Costing \n(ABC), European Foundation for Quality \nManagement (EFQM), Six Sigma, Performance \nPyramid, Benchmarking, System both Du Pont and \nValue Based Management (VBM) indicators. 15% of \nthe participating companies stated that they used one \nof the mentioned performance measurement systems \nalso for measuring the performance of controlling \nprocesses. Whether or not they try (as later \nqualitative research has proved) to, more or less \nsuccessfully, apply th e established methods of \nevaluating business performance. In 90% of cases, \npresenting companies with foreign capital that took \nover the concept from the parent company, but it was \nnot a comprehensive methodology for evaluating the \nperformance of controlling processes. The \nperformance measurement s ystems listed included \nABC, BSC, Benchmarking and Value Based \nManagement. An effort exists to evaluate the \nperformance of controlling using our own specific \nindicators. In terms of the size of the companies \nexamined these were only medium and large \ncompanies, with the share of large companies \nrepresenting 75%.   \nOf the companies surveyed, 18% did not use any \nsuch system, but were convinced that one of these \nsystems could be applied in the context of their \ncompanies, namely BSC, EFQM, ABC and \nBenchmarking. In addition, in this case most of these \ncompanies had a foreign owner. 11% of the analyzed \ncompanies are considering the introduction of BSC, \nBenchmarking and Valu e Based Management \nsystems. The results of the research pointed to the \nfact that almost half (48%) of companies do not use \nany system to measure the performance of \ncontrolling processes. In addition, they do not \nconsider its implementation. 16% of heads of \ncontrolling departments in the surveyed companies \nare convinced that it is not possible to objectively \nmeasure the performance of controlling. 4% of \nrespondents chose the last option, which was in the \nnature of an open-ended qu estion. They stated that \nthey had no experience with similar systems or that it \nwas not possible to define preferences here. The \nfollowing Figure 1 reveals the barriers to evaluating \nthe performance of controlling processes. \n \n \n \nFigure 1. Reasons for the controlling absence in business \nevaluation \n \nAs we can see from the graph, the results suggest \nthat for almost a third of the companies surveyed, \ntheir current controlling tools are sufficient and there \nis no need of other performance measurement \nsystems. 9% of companies stated the high demands of \nsuch systems on time and financial resources as the \nreason for the absence of systems for measuring the \nperformance of controlling processes. One-fifth of \ncompanies see the barrier to implement these systems \nin the cost of implementing and maintaining the \nsystem. Another fifth of the surveyed companies has \nnot yet been able to find a suitable approach to \nmeasuring controlling performance. For 30% of the \nsurveyed companies, other projects were a priority. \nAmong other reasons for the  absence of evaluations \nof controlling performance, they mentioned the group \npolicy of the company, which prioritizes other \nprojects and perceives controlling only as a support \ntool.  \nIn science and in practice, the issue of performance \nand optimization of contro lling is increasingly the \nfocus of professional publications, controlling \nconferences and knowledge transfer programs abroad. \nUnfortunately, the previous  description still does not \napply to the situation in Czech and Slovak companies. \nAs the results of surveys have shown, the issue of \nperformance evaluation and optimization of \ncontrolling processes is still not on the \"agenda.\" \nBased on quantitative and qualitative research, the \nevaluation of company performance and business \nprocesses is one of the most important controlling \ntasks in the practice of our companies, but companies \ndo not yet attach great importance to performance \nevaluation and optimization of their controlling \nprocesses.

We further \nexamined whether there is any connection in the case \nof the establishment of a separate position of a \ncontroller, any connection between the Slovak \ncompany  and a company with foreign representation. \nOf the surveyed companies that participated in a \nquestionnaire survey, 19 of them stated a purely \nSlovak property structure and 4 companies with a \nforeign representation. \nIn the second part, we focused on finding out the \nexistence of the position of  a controller (see Table 2) \nrespectively non-use of controlling or some of its \ntools in corporate management, as well as finding out \nattempts of possible implementation of controlling \ninto management, reasons for not using the \ncontrolling system. Three companies stated that they \nhad the position of the controller, which represents \nmore than 13% of all companies. In almost 87% of \ncompanies, the position of the controller does not \nexist yet at all. In small businesses, the owner, \nsometimes in cooperation with the economist, mainly \nperforms the controlling tasks. It is clear from this \nthat in smaller companies controlling is not yet fully \ndomesticated. \n \nTable 2. Controller position in the analyzed enterprises \n \n Number % rate \nYes 3 13.04% \nNo 20 86.96% \nSum 23 100.00% \n \nAs further follows from the research, the position \nof the controller exists only in medium-sized \ncompanies with foreign participation. These \ncompanies have already used controlling. For \ncompanies without foreign participation, the use of \ncontrolling is no longer obvious. This was also \nconfirmed as this position is established in one joint \nstock company and in two limited liability \ncompanies. All three companies indicated a foreign \nownership structure. We can state that hypothesis \nH1, which assumed that a separate position of the \ncontroller was established in each company with a \nforeign ownership structure, is not confirmed.  \nThe following questions of the questionnaire were \nconnected with hypothesis H2: We assume that more \nthan 50% of small and medium-sized enterprises use \ncontrolling tools in corporate management and \nhypothesis H3: We assume that the application of \ncontrolling and its tools is more a matter for medium-\nsized enterprises than small enterprises. These two \nhypotheses are closely related. In the following \nquestion of the questionnaire, we structured the \ninterviewed respondents a ccording to whether they \nare currently carrying out any controlling activities or \nnot (see Figure 2).  \n \n \n \nFigure 2. Use of controlling tools  \n \nAs Figure 2 shows, less than 80% of all businesses \nreported controlling apply tools in corporate \ngovernance. The rest of th e businesses does not \nimplement  controlling.  All medium-sized \nenterprises (6) reported th e use of controlling tools \n(H3). The situation is diffe rent for small businesses, \nand we have found from research that not every third \nsmall businesses deal with the issue of controlling.  \n \nTable 3.

Such a separate controlling \ndepartment exists in less than nine percent of all \nsurveyed companies. In every sixth company, one \nemployee from an unspecified department performs \ncontrolling. As mentioned above, the fifth company \ndoes not use controlling. The majority of companies \nhave integrated basic controlling tools without a \nspecialized expert. \n\nTEM Journal. Volume 11, Issue 1, pages 356‐366, ISSN 2217‐8309, DOI: 10.18421/TEM111‐45, February 2022. \n362                                                                                                                          TEM Journal – Volume 11 / Number 1 / 2022. \nBased on the obtained results, we can state that \nhypothesis H2, which assumed that corporate \ngovernance used a controlling tool by more than 50% \nof small and medium-sized enterprises, is confirmed. \nHypothesis H3 is also confirmed, as we found out by \nprocessing the obtained data that all medium-sized \ncompanies that participated in the questionnaire \nsurvey use controlling tools.  \nOther questions from the questionnaire related to \nhypothesis H4: We assume that small and medium-\nsized enterprises in the Prešov region focus mainly on \nfinancial indicators in corporate management. 21.74% \nof companies do not use any controlling tools. As we \ncan see from Graph no. 8, less than half of the \nsurveyed companies focus mainly on financial \ncontrolling, where they u se planning and various \nreports from economic financial analyzes, which are \nbased mainly on internal accounting and various \nsources that are focused on the financial health of \ncompanies. More than a third of the surveyed \ncompanies use accounting outputs, budgets as well as \ncalculations, which are part of cost controlling, \nfocused mainly on cost management, as illustrated in \nFigure 3. \n \n \n \nFigure 3. Type of controlling tools  \n \nFigure 4 shows us the areas of focus of controlling. \nThe companies surveyed, which answered the \nprevious question in the affirmative, had the \nopportunity to specify the areas in more detail here \nfocus of controlling in the ir corporate management, \nthey could choose several options when answering. \n \n \n \nFigure 4. Orientation of controlling in the management  \n \nThe data we obtained from the surveyed companies \npointed to the fact that most companies stated that \nthey monitor financial indicators and financial results, \nwhich provide them with a comprehensive report on \nthe overall management and fi nancial health of their \ncompany. They immediately followed by the area of \ncost controlling, which significantly confirmed the \nprevious question from the questionnaire. Five of the \nsurveyed companies mentioned product focus, two \ncompanies focus on customers and only in one case \nprocedural focus of controlling was mentioned. Based \non the results obtained, we can conclude low \nawareness on process management in small and \nmedium-sized enterprises. Hypothesis H4 that small \nand medium-sized enterpris es in the Prešov region \nfocus mainly on financial indicators in corporate \ngovernance has not been confirmed. \nIn connection with the last hypothesis H5: We \nassume that the main problems in introduction of \ncontrolling into the management of small and \nmedium-sized enterprises are a shortcoming qualified \nstaff and insufficient knowledge of this modern \nmanagement system, companies should specify the \nmain issues encountered during implementation \ncontrolling also in its subsequent use. Only \ncompanies that use controlling (out of the total \nnumber of positive answers 18, small enterprises were \n12 and medium-sized 6)   could give more answers.  \nBased on research results, increasing software costs \nis the most common controlling implementation \nproblem for small and m edium-sized businesses. \nOnly less than a third of companies do not see the \nproblem in being sufficiently qualified staff to \nperform the function of the controller. As follows \nfrom Figure 5, the majority of the surveyed \ncompanies also do not know enough about this \nmodern management approach. For every fifth \ncompany, implementation is a problem in terms of \ntime. Most medium-sized companies perceive the \nproblem of implementation in  terms of financial and \npersonnel. \n \n\nTEM Journal. Volume 11, Issue 1, pages 356‐366, ISSN 2217‐8309, DOI: 10.18421/TEM111‐45, February 2022. \nTEM Journal – Volume 11 / Number  1 / 2022.                                                                                                                            363 \n \n \nFigure 5. Main obstacles for controlling implementation  \n \nOther reasons given by th e respondents for small \nand medium-sized enterprises were the costs of the \nimplementation itself (7), but also the costs of a \npossible external consultancy firm (6). In addition to \nthese financial barriers, they also specified possible \nproblems from the point of view of the organization, \nwhere they indicated the long implementation period \n(6) and the necessary change in the company's \ninformation system used (4). In solving the second \npart of hypothesis H5, we also evaluate question no. 8 \nfrom the questionnaire. When asked if they had ever \ntried to introduce a controlling system into the \ncompany's management in the past, more than a half \nof the respondents answered in the negative (see \nTable 4). By a deeper analysis of the data obtained \nfrom the interviewed respondents, we found that \nsmall companies did not implement the controlling \nsystem.  \n \nTable 4.

At the same time, we can state that there is \nstill not enough information about the awareness of \ncontrolling in the conditions  of small and medium-\nsized enterprises. Hypothesis H5, which assumed that \nthe lack of qualified staff and insufficient knowledge \nof this modern management system will be the main \nproblems in the implementation of the controlling \nsystem in the corporate management of small and \nmedium-sized enterprises, was not confirmed. \n \n \n \n \n5. Discussion  \n \nThe return on such questionnaires is still low. This \nis despite the fact that the surveyed companies had an \nopportunity to learn about the results of the \nquestionnaire survey, where they could at least take \nsomething for their manage ment of their company, \nrespectively. It can be stated that there is no general \ninterest in such research. This may be associated with \na kind of reluctance and distrust of the statutes and \nexecutives of companies to file respectively disclose \nsensitive data. During the research, we contacted \nseveral companies and it was necessary to divide \nthem by size. It is clear from the results of the \nresearch that no large company participated in the \nsurvey.  \nPredominantly in small companies, there are no \nseparate controlling departments or a separate \nposition of the controller. This is mainly due to the \nlimited capacity of small businesses, as mainly the \nowners, often in cooperation with a financial \naccountant or economist, perform the controlling \ntasks in them. However, accounting does not provide \nthem with answers to the questions of how to: \noptimize costs, finance pr ojects, create budgets, and \nplan financial flows. The performance of controlling \nrequires special knowledge and skills that force \nmanagement (leaders) to re-learn, which requires \nsome effort (and time). Owners or managers often do \nnot have the necessary expertise or qualifications to \nperform controlling tasks. F or these companies, it \nwould be reasonable to introduce controlling in the \nform of outsourcing services, or use the services of an \nexternal controller, who has extensive experience not \nonly in controlling, but also in other companies or \nvarious business sectors. He also has access to various \nadvanced IT tools which would be expensive for \nsmall businesses. A possible disadvantage of an \nexternal controller is that he must first be acquainted \nwith the company; get to know its strategy, vision, \nand goals. Moreover, because he is not always in the \nworkplace, he is in charge of several companies; he \nwill never reach the level that an internal worker can.  \nIn the case of medium-sized companies, it is \nappropriate to optimize the already established \ncontrolling concept, set up their own controlling \ndepartment or department, using controlling software \noffered by various software companies, or \ninterconnecting controlling solutions and reporting \nwith an already existing information system.

They \ncontribute to the prediction of the economic situation, \nbut also to plan. They c ontinuously monitor goals, \nfinancial performance and performance to help \nowners and management respond flexibly and \nquickly. \nSmall and medium-sized enterprises should \nimplement and regularly evaluate the current state of \ntheir business, analyze their strengths and \nweaknesses, perform a SWO T analysis, based on \nwhich they will learn how they are doing [39]. \nIt is no less important to perform a financial \neconomic analysis, use and evaluate plans, budgets or \ncalculations when managi ng business processes. \nCompare the results with plans that need to be \nevaluated later in management, link cost and revenue \ncalculations to the plan is also of great importance. \nEqually important in managi ng business processes is \nthe use of budgets. In general, the budget does not \nonly represent a kind of forecast of the financial \nstatements, but it determines all the main areas of \nactivity of companies, it describes them in terms of \nfinancial, organizational and operational. It defines \nthe planned activities with their results at all levels. \nKey employees in cooperation with management \nshould prepare it. During the implementation of the \nbudget, which will take place  during the financial \nyear, it is appropriate to analyze the results already \nimplemented and compare them with the approved \nbudget. Based on these data , subsequently process \nand prepare for management once a month, control \nreports that point to the cu rrent state and forecasts. \nThen there is the need to analyze any observed \ndeviations and predict their impact on the current \nsituation in the company. The company's \nmanagement will thus obtain information on \ndeviations from the budget, and their possible impact \non the company, assess their significance for the \ncompany and can immediately take measures to \nrenew its planned route of business development.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6. Conclusion \n \nAt present, thanks to the arrival of multinational \ncompanies in Slovakia, a popular management \ntechnique called controlling is becoming a modern \ntool for managing the economy, even in small and \nmedium-sized enterprises. Properly and actively \napplied controlling is a way to increase the \nperformance of the company, because its role is not \nto manage real processes in the company, but to \nmanage the entire company through information \nabout real processes. However, small and medium-\nsized enterprises often forget to implement tools in \ntheir business processes that would help them to \nidentify possible causes of their problems in time. \nThey mistakenly believe that it is sufficient if only a \ncontrol tool is set up in corporate management. If the \ncompany's management no longer tries to identify \nand reveal the causes of possible problems during the \nprocess, it is quite likely that it will return to them in \nthe form of a problem that has already arisen. Thanks \nto the introduction of properly functioning \ncontrolling, companies can p revent various crises in \nthe future. Through the application of controlling \nmethods and tools, management can keep their \ncompany under control so that its performance is \nconstantly growing. The introduction of controlling \nwill thus help not only to identify possible pitfalls, \nbut also to put in place effective measures in time to \nprevent them in the future. In addition, small and \nmedium-sized enterprises can obtain quality \nproduction and sales planning, budgeting of costs and \nsales prices, control of the fulfillment of planned \nresults and profit, and regular reports on the \neconomic situation of their company.  It is clear from \nthe results of the research that no large company \nparticipated in the survey, where lies possible future \nresearch. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTEM Journal. Volume 11, Issue 1, pages 356‐366, ISSN 2217‐8309, DOI: 10.18421/TEM111‐45, February 2022. \nTEM Journal – Volume 11 / Number  1 / 2022.                                                                                                                            365 \nReferences \n \n[1].
