    "abstract": "Optical coherence tomography (OCT), owing to its non-invasive nature, has demonstrated tremendous potential in clinical practice and has become a prevalent diagnostic method. Nevertheless, the inherent speckle noise and low sampling rate in OCT imaging often limit the quality of OCT images. In this paper, we propose a lightweight Transformer to efficiently reconstruct high-quality images from noisy and low-resolution OCT images acquired by short scans. Our method, PSCAT, parallelly employs spatial window self-attention and channel attention in the Transformer block to aggregate features from both spatial and channel dimensions. It explores the potential of the Transformer in denoising and super-resolution for OCT, reducing computational costs and enhancing the speed of image processing. To effectively assist in restoring high-frequency details, we introduce a hybrid loss function in both spatial and frequency domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our PSCAT has fewer network parameters and lower computational costs compared to state-of-the-art methods while delivering a competitive performance both qualitatively and quantitatively.",
