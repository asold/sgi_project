    "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title> The proliferation of natural language processing applications has brought to light the critical need for robust mechanisms to safeguard against malicious prompts that can lead to harmful or misleading outputs. The novel concept of automated safety circuit breakers significantly enhances the reliability and integrity of large language models by integrating advanced machine learning algorithms with dynamic rule-based systems, providing a scalable and efficient solution for real-time threat mitigation. Comprehensive evaluation of the implemented system revealed high precision, recall, and F1-score, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately filtering out malicious content and reducing the incidence of misleading responses. Comparative analysis with existing methods highlights the superiority of the automated approach, which offers significant advantages in terms of adaptability and operational efficiency. The research underscores the importance of continuous innovation in the field of natural language processing to ensure the safe and trustworthy deployment of language models across various applications. The findings reinforce the necessity of developing sophisticated automated tools to maintain the security and dependability of generated outputs, addressing both current vulnerabilities and potential future threats.",
