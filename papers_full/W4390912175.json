  "full_text": "On modeling the rhythm of natural languages \nPier Marco Bertinetto and Chiara Bertini \nLaboratorio di Linguistica \nScuola Normale Superiore, Pisa \n{bertinetto; c.bertini}@sns.it \nAbstract \nWe describe a new model for the formal representation of the \nrhythmic tendencies of natural languages. The algorithm is a \nmodification of PVI, proposed by Grabe and Low [10]. The \nmodel was tested on a fairly substantial corpus of Italian semi-\nspontaneous productions, and its outcome compared with that \nyielded by two well-known algorithms (Ramus [14] and PVI).  \n1. Introduction \nThe traditional view about rhythm in natural languages stems \nfrom the pioneering proposal by Pike [13], according to which \nlanguages differ along the divide “ syllable- vs. stress-timing” . \nTaken literally, this would imply the following, with (1a-b) \ndepicting, respectively, an ideal syllable- vs. stress-timed \nlanguage (underlining stands for stressed syllables). \nIsochronicity is to be found at the level of syllables in (a) and \nof inter-stress intervals in (b): \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1: Schematic representation of the traditional divide: \n (a) syllable- vs. (b) stress-timing. \n \nIt was soon obvious that this simplified view could not \npossibly correspond to reality. In particular, the ideal syllable-\ntimed type could only be approached by languages with very \nregular and simple syllable structure. Languages departing \nfrom this scheme would present striking deviations. This led to \na number of amendments, some of which attempted to root the \nrhythmic typology on perception, rather than production. By \nthe end of the Seventies, however, it became increasingly clear \nthat the traditional view was unsatisfactory. Yet, the intuition \nthat the basic divide contained some grain of truth persisted, \nleading to reinterpretation of the basic contrast in terms of an \narray of alternative features, mostly phonologically inspired \n[2, 7, 3]. Although this interpretation was probably on the right \ntrack, it was not entirely satisfactory, for it is not easy to map \nit onto a specific set of phonetic properties. A step in this \ndirection was taken by [4, 5], where the original dichotomy \nwas reinterpreted with respect to the continuum “ controlling \nvs. compensating”  languages. \nThe basic idea of the “ control vs. compensation”  (CC) \nhypothesis, inspired by work in articulatory phonology and \nearlier on by the seminal work by C.A.Fowler [9], was that \nlanguages may differ in terms of how vocalic and consonantal \ngestures are coupled in the articulatory flow. An ideally \ncontrolling (henceforth CTL vs. CPS) language should be \nconceived of as a language in which all segments receive the \nsame amount of expenditure, i.e. articulatory effort, and \n(ideally) tend to have the same duration. This is obviously \nimpossible, due to the varying points and manners of \narticulation; but this view acquires plausibility once we \nconsider how languages do in fact differ in terms of the \ncoupling of vocalic and consonantal gestures. Some languages \nadmit a much higher segmental overlap (coarticulation) than \nothers. This view bears resemblances with proposals recently \nadvanced [12, 1], where the respective contribution of the \nsyllabic and accentual oscillators are modeled by means of \nelegant algorithms. In fact, the latter proposals and the CC \nhypothesis should be viewed as converging towards a possible \nintegration. The CC view aims at describing the intra-syllabic \nbehavior, which in turn affects (or is possibly affected by) the \noverarching accentual alternation, primarily taken into account \nin [1, 12]. Which of these components is the dominant factor \nremains, for the time being, unclear. \nLet us detail the theoretical consequences. The contrast \n“ syllable- vs. stress-timing” , reinterpreted in terms of CC, \ncould be visually represented as in (2a-b):  \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2: Schematic representation of the CC hypothesis:  \n(a) controlling vs. (b) compensating languages. \n \nThis is a very abstract representation, but enough to grasp the \nessential difference vis-à-vis the traditional view. CPS \nlanguages (2b), corresponding to the hitherto hypothesized \nstress-timed type, paradoxically bear some resemblance with \nthe traditional syllable-timed pattern (1a), owing to intra-\nsyllabic duration compensation. They differ from it, however, \ndue to the increased gestural overlap in unstressed syllables, \nwhere the segment most liable to compression / coarticulation \nis of course the vocalic nucleus. Needless too say, this also \noccurs in CTL languages: the difference is a matter of degree \nalong a continuum. As a consequence, in CTL languages, the \nsyllable duration is more directly related to the segments \nnumber, due to the reduced amount of consonant/vowel \noverlapping (henceforth: C and V, respectively). \nA possible test to assess this hypothesis consists in \nchecking the effect of speech tempo. The prediction is that CTL \nlanguages should tend to reduce the segments duration in a \nmore proportional way, whereas in CPS languages Vs should \nbe somewhat more affected than Cs. \nSpeech Prosody 2008\nCampinas, Brazil\nMay 6-9, 2008\nISCA Archive\nhttp://www.isca-speech.org/archive\n427Speech Prosody 2008, Campinas, Brazil\n10.21437/SpeechProsody.2008-94\n2. The Control/Compensation Index \nIn the light of the above discussion, we would like to propose \na new tool for modeling the rhythmical behavior of natural \nlanguages. We shall call it ‘Control/Compensation Index’ \n(CCI). The idea consists in relativizing the PVI model [10] to \nthe number of segments composing the V and C intervals. In \npractice, the duration of each interval is divided by the number \nof segments in it, according to the following formula, where m \nstands for ‘number of intervals’ (V or C, as separately \nconsidered), d for ‘duration’, n for ‘number of segments within \nthe relevant interval’: \n \n1\n1\n1\n11\n100\n+\n+\n-\n=\n--= \u0001\nk\nk\nm\nk k\nk\nn\nd\nn\nd\nmCCI    (1) \nSince we treat glides as Cs, V intervals mostly consist of a \nsingle element, except for hiatuses. It is worth noting that our \nformula (just as those in [10] and [14]) does not directly take \nthe notion of syllable into account, for a C interval may begin \nwith a coda and end with an onset. Although this is at odds \nwith the traditional view regarding the timing of natural \nlanguages, this should not be seen as a problem. The CCI \nmodel in fig. 2 suggests that the syllable has virtually no \neffect, despite the traditional label of syllable-timing attached \nto one of the two poles of the rhythmic divide. In any case, we \nalso checked the CCI algorithm by separately considering \nonset and coda intervals (see [16]). In this paper, however, we \nshall not report the results obtained by this further version of \nthe algorithm. Our present goal is to compare the CCI model \nwith a selection of the existing ones, in order to evaluate the \nrespective virtues. \nThe CCI model bears resemblance with the one proposed \nin [15], based on so-called “ pseudo-syllables” , for one  of the \npossible measures consists in the number of segments \ncomposing the C intervals. There are, however, differences. In \n[15], each V is treated as the nucleus of a different syllable, \nwhereas in CCI model each V interval is divided by the \nnumber of elements composing it. This is obviously vacuous \nin most cases but not with hiatuses, which make up complex V \nintervals. More generally, CCI has the following distinctive \nfeatures: (a) it takes into due account the degree of phonotactic \ncomplexity as reflected by the number of segments composing \neach interval (both V and C ones), a feature that is ultimately \nat the core of the contrast CTL vs. CPS languages; (b) it takes \nadvantage of the PVI design, which is (in our view) superior to \nthe models in [14] and [15] in its ability to monitor the actual \ndurational behavior of speech, i.e. the moment-by-moment \noscillations in segment durations. In a forthcoming paper [16] \nwe provide a detailed discussion of the model in [15].  \nLet us describe the ideal (obviously abstract) situations, as \ndepicted in fig. 3. A CTL language should fall in the white area, \nnear the bisecting line, for the durational fluctuations of Cs \nand Vs should by and large be of the same magnitude. By \ncontrast, a CPS language should fluctuate more in the V than in \nthe C portions, thus falling in the bottom grey area. This would \nmostly be caused by the sizeable durational differences \nbetween stressed and unstressed Vs, with the latter undergoing \nheavier coarticulatory effects. The complementary situation \n(i.e. a language with larger C than V fluctuations) would by \ncontrast undergo severe restrictions: the upper grey surface \ndelimits an area where an actual language is unlikely to be \nfound. Needless to say, only in models such as CCI (where \neach interval is divided by the number of segments composing \nit) may the bisecting line take such a precise interpretation; the \nRamusian and PVI models do not fully allow this inference, \nfor one does not know what is exactly at stake behind the \nintervals’ durational variation, particularly with  respect to C \nintervals: \n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n0 1 2 3 4\nV\nC\nimplausible\ncontrolling\ncompensating\n \nFigure 3: Schematic representation of the major rhythmic \ntypes according to the CC hypothesis. \nOur corpus was derived from the semi-spontaneous \nproductions of 10 speakers of the Pisa variety of Italian, \nengaged in the so-called ‘map-task’. This consists in a two-\nperson dialog fostered by two slightly different maps. One of \nthe speakers (Giver) provides instructions to the other \n(Follower), so that s/he can find the intended goal on the map. \nThe gradual discovery of the maps differences, of which the \ntwo speakers may or may not be aware from the outset, feeds \nthe communicative intercourse. The V and C intervals \nconsidered were 1765 and 1755, respectively. The criteria for \nthe selection of the relevant speech stretches from our corpus \nare described in [6]. In particular, we discarded the final \nportion of each utterance, from the last stressed syllable \n(inclusive) onward. This portion has an entirely different \nrhythmic behavior, that should best be analyzed on its own. \nThe choice of semi-spontaneous materials for our purposes \ndeserves a note. On the positive side, the empirical basis on \nwhich we root our conclusions is considerably larger than is \noften the case in this sort of studies, yielding a much firmer \nstatistical stability. On the negative side, we are aware that the \nuse of semi-spontaneous materials is regarded as inappropriate \nby some authors. We would however defend our choice, for \nthe endeavor to model linguistic rhythm should not neglect \nspontaneous speech. The obvious caveat consists in referring \nany conclusion to the given speech style.  \n3. Results and discussion \nFor the sake of homogeneity, the figures reported below \ninvariably show the C measure on the ordinate and the V one \non the abscissa. We are aware that some variants of the \navailable models present V or C measures on both axes, but \nwe regard this as unattractive, for both Vs and Cs contribute to \nthe rhythmic behavior. For comparison with CCI, we chose \ntwo of the most representative models, i.e. those described in: \n- [14] in two of its possible versions, with the V measure \nexpressed as DV (standard deviation of the V intervals) or as \n%V (percentage of Vs over the global duration); the C \nmeasure is indicated as DC in both cases; \n- [10] in its two versions, with raw (rPVI) and normalized V \ndata (nPVI), where normalization aims at counteracting the \nintra-sentential tempo variations; the basic algorithm is \nessentially as in (1) above, except for the n variable; \n428Speech Prosody 2008, Campinas, Brazil\nFig. 4 depicts the respective positioning on the Cartesian \nplane yielded by the five models. In order to have everything \non the same graphic, the DV, %V and nPVI values were \ndivided by 10. The ovals in fig. 4 hint at the spatial dispersion \nof the 10 speakers considered (the respective size is based on \nthe relative error computed on Vs and Cs): \n \n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7V\nC\nn PVI\nCCI\nr PVI\n\u0001V\n%V\n \nFigure 4: Spatial representation of five rhythmic models. \nAlthough, according to the caveat put forth above, the fine \ninterpretation of the bisecting line is not the same for each \nmodel, we would like to underline the following points. DV \nand (to some extent) rPVI fall in the middle of the Cartesian \nplane, suggesting that the V and C intervals present, \naltogether, a similar behavior. With nPVI, by contrast, there is \nmore variation on the C than on the V axis, but one should \nnote that in the latter model the measures on the two axes are \nof completely different magnitudes (this, as noted, also applies \nto %V). CCI and %V indicate the alternative tendency, \nwhereby the durational fluctuation is larger for Vs than for Cs. \nConsidering what is known of the phonetics of Italian, this \nseems to be a better representation of the actual facts. Italian \npresents a duration contrast between stressed and unstressed \nVs (although a much weaker one than often stated, as shown \nby [8]), whereas no equivalent differences are to be noted \namong Cs. Obviously, Italian has geminate Cs, differing in \nduration with respect to simple Cs; however, in our model \ngeminates are counted as two segments, as dictated by most \nphonological approaches.  \nWe then examined the disaggregated data, i.e. the separate \nprojection of the individual speakers’ behavior. As shown by \nthe ovals in fig. 4, the data are relatively scattered in each \nmodel, with the exception of %V and nPVI. This follows from \nthe nature of the latter models: in %V, the V measure is \nrelatively static, as compared with the other models; in nPVI, \nthe lower dispersion is a by-product of normalization. Fig. 5a-\nb show the actual dispersion as represented by two selected \nmodels, namely CCI (a) and DV (b). The bisecting line is \ndrawn for reference; see fig. 4 for the relative position on the \nCartesian plane. \nThe dispersion is in part due to the different number of \ndata points available for each speaker, as shown by the \nindividual variances in fig. 5a-b, but it also depends on \ninherent individual tendencies. These may in turn depend on \nthe different roles played by the speakers as map-task Givers \nor Followers (as shown by filled vs. blank symbols), but may \nalso reflect idiosyncratic inclinations. Indeed, it can be shown \nthat speech tempo is a better predictor of rhythmic behavior \nthan map-task role; the two factors are strongly but not \nexhaustively correlated [6]. This is no wonder: it is well-\nknown that different speakers of the same language may \nprovide different results in terms of rhythmic behavior [1, 11]. \nMost models considered here exhibit a remarkable sensitivity \nto small individual differences, with the two exceptions \npointed out above. The comparison between fig. 5a and 5b \nshows, however, that the relative positioning of the various \nspeakers changes according to the algorithm employed, \nsuggesting that the choice of the model is no innocent matter \neven in this respect.  \n \n225\n411\n91\n238\n573\n1019\n346\n121496\n2466\n1,0\n1,5\n2,0\n2,5\n3,0\n3,5\n4,0\n2,5 3,0 3,5 4,0 4,5 5,0 5,5\nCCI (V)\nCCI (C)\nCF\nCG\nBF\nBG\nAF\nAG\nD2F\nD2G\nD1F\nD1G\n \nIndividual differences\n225\n411\n238\n91\n573\n1019\n346\n121\n496\n2466\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n60\n25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60\n\u0001V\n\u0001C\nCF\nCG\nBG\nBF\nAF\nAG\nD2F\nD2G\nD1F\nD1G\n \nFigure 5a-b: Individual behaviors as represented in CCI (a) \nand DV (b). The digits refer to the intervals number (V plus C). \nFinally, we examined the effect of speech tempo. For this \npurpose, we divided the speakers’ productions in three tempo-\ngroups, as measured in syllables per second: (I) 4.8 < 7.0 \n(average: 6,0); (II) \u0002 7,0 < 8,1 (average: 7,6); (III) > 8,1 \n(average: 9,2). The groupings were obtained by evenly \ndistributing the individual productions, so that all groups \nwould approximately be of the same size in terms of intervals \nnumber. The results are shown in fig. 6, where again the DV, \n%V and nPVI values were divided by 10 for homogeneity. \nNote that, in this case, the ellipses merely connect the tempo-\ngroups (I,II,III) within each model for ease of the reader. \nThe t-test discriminations in table 1 yield some hints. The \ncontrast I / II is significant for both Vs and Cs in CCI, rPVI \nand DV, and for Cs alone in %V. The contrast II / III is \nsignificant for both Vs and Cs in %V, and for Cs alone in \nrPVI. As for nPVI, it only discriminates I from III on the V \naxis. Considering the strong rhythmical effect of tempo, as \nalso shown by [1], this calls into doubt the very essence of the \nlatter model, based on the attempt to minimize tempo \ndifferences. %V looks somewhat extravagant, for it is the only \none to emphasize the contrast II / III. This may, however, be \nexplained: since, with the slowest tempos, the compression is \nvery evenly distributed over Vs and Cs, the %V value remains \n429Speech Prosody 2008, Campinas, Brazil\nstable. Conversely, since (according to rPVI and DV) Cs seem \nto vary more than Vs between II and III, the %V value is \ncorrespondingly higher in the latter tempo group. The model \n%V appears thus to be, to some extent, the mirror image of the \nother models, as also shown by its diverging spatial \norientation. This, however, does not explain why there should \nbe such a neat II / III contrast on the C axis (a feature shared, \nas noted, by rPVI and DV). The results yielded by CCI provide \na comparatively more plausible picture. In a supposedly CTL \nlanguage like Italian, tempo increases should tend to compress \nVs and Cs more or less alike, and this is what we found. \nBesides, the compressibility threshold should be reached \nrelatively soon, and sooner with Cs than with Vs. In our data, \nthis limit is met within group III; and a finer separation of the \ntempo groups (not attempted here) might possibly show that \nthe limit is indeed reached sooner with Cs than with Vs, as \nhinted at in fig. 6 and as shown by the Mann-Whitney II / III \ncomparison, which is significant for Vs alone . \n \nI\nIIIII\nII\nIII\nIII\nII\nIII\nII\nIII\nI\nIII\nI I\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n2 3 4 5 6 7\nn PVI\nCCI\nr PVI\n\u0001V\n%V\nV\nC\n \nFigure 6: Tempo groups dispersion in five models. \n \n  v1 vs. v2 v2 vs. v3 \nV 0,000 n.s.

Conclusion \nWe compared four well-known rhythm modeling algorithms \nwith the CCI model first proposed here. The results obtained \nwere promising. The CCI algorithm appeared: (i) to allow \nneatly interpretable hypotheses in terms of positioning on the \nCartesian plane (fig. 4); (ii) to be as fine-tuned as its best \ncompetitors in capturing the individual speakers’ behavior \n(fig. 5); (ii) to provide very plausible tempo-groups \ndiscrimination (fig. 6). This suggests that CCI might turn out \nto be a viable representation of the rhythmic tendencies of \nnatural languages. \nNeedless to say, the ultimate proof must rest on the ability \nto discriminate between different languages, providing \nconsistent groupings among them. Our next goal will thus be \nto apply this method to different languages, obviously with \ncomparable speech materials. We also intend to compare \nspontaneous and read speech, to check for style variations.  \nOur data were so-far based on spontaneous productions. \nThis is not often the case in speech rhythm studies, although \nany realistic modeling of natural languages should include \nthis sort of data. At any rate, the size of the corpus analyzed \nprovided robust statistical reliability to our conclusions. One \nmajor result was that speech tempo has a striking impact on \nthe rhythmical behavior. This is not new, but it turns out to be \ntoo often overlooked when different languages are compared. \nMeaningful comparisons should only involve homogeneous \ndata. \n5.
