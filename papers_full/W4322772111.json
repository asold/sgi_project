    "abstract": "The article elaborates on the accuracy of current transformers (CT) in interaction with temperature and frequency using Pearson’s correlation. The first part of the analysis compares the accuracy of the mathematical model of the current transformer and the result of the measurement on the real CT using the Pearson correlation calculation. The mathematical model of CT is determined by deriving the formula of the functional error with the display of the accuracy of the measured value. The accuracy of the mathematical model is affected by the accuracy of current transformer model parameters and the calibration characteristic of the ammeter used to measure the CT current. Variables that cause deviation in the accuracy of CT are temperature and frequency. The calculation shows the effects on accuracy in both cases. The second part of the analysis refers to the calculation of the partial correlation of three quantities: (1) CT accuracy, (2) temperature, and (3) frequency on a set of 160 measurements. First, the influence of temperature on the correlation of CT accuracy and frequency is proven, following the proof of the influence of frequency on the correlation of CT accuracy and temperature. In the end, the analysis is combined by comparing the measured results of the first and second part of the analysis.",
