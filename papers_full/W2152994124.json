Consecutive sampling was used to select\n649 participants who started TB treatment or ART in the preceding month. Participants were first interviewed using\nthe CES-D and AUDIT, and subsequently with a psychiatric diagnostic interview for current major depressive\ndisorder (MDD) and alcohol use disorders (AUDs) using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI).\nThe diagnostic accuracy was calculated using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC).\nThe optimum cut-off scores for clinical use were calculated using sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV).\nResults: The CES-D and AUDIT had high internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.84; 0.98 respectively).\nConfirmatory factor analysis showed that the four-factor CES-D model was not a good fit for the data (Tucker-Lewis\nFit Index (TLI) = 0.86; standardized root-mean square residual (SRMR) = 0.06) while the two-factor AUDIT model\nfitted the data well (TFI = 0.99; SRMR = 0.04). Both the CES-D and AUDIT demonstrated good discriminatory ability\nin detecting MINI-defined current MDDs and AUDs (AUROC for CES-D = 0.78; AUDIT = 0.98 for women and 0.75\nfor men). The optimum CES-D cut-off score in screening for current MDD was 22 (sensitivity 73%, PPV 76%) while\nthat of the AUDIT in screening for AUD was 24 for women (sensitivity 60%, PPV 60%), and 20 for men (sensitivity\n55%, PPV 50%).\nConclusions: The CES-D and AUDIT showed high discriminatory ability in measuring MINI-defined current MDD\nand AUD respectively. They are suitable mental health screening tools for use among TB and ART patients in\nprimary care in Zambia.\nBackground\nMental health disorders, human immunodeficiency virus\n(HIV) and tuberculosis (TB) have a profound impact on\npublic health in sub-Saharan Africa [1], yet there are\nlimited data on the interaction between major depres-\nsive disorders (MDDs), alcohol use disorders (AUDs)\nwith HIV [2] and TB in this region. Many sub-Saharan\nAfrican countries carry a high burden of HIV [3] and\nalcohol-related morbidity and mortality [4,5]. For\nexample, the prevalence of MDDs among HIV positive\nindividuals has been estimated as 43.7% in South Africa\n[6], 71.3% in Zimbabwe [7] and 47% in Uganda [8].\nThe causal relationships between mental disorders and\nHIV are complex [1]. MDD [9] and hazardous alcohol\nconsumption [10,11] are ass ociated with high risk of\nHIV acquisition and transmission, and with poorer\nadherence to anti-retroviral therapy (ART) [12] and TB\ntreatment [13]. Conversely diagnosis with HIV increases\nrisk of depression and alcohol abuse [14]. Neuropsychia-\ntric complications of HIV include HIV encephalopathy,\ndepression, mania, cognitive disorders, and frank\ndementia, alone or in combination.

The HIV prevalence in\nZambian adults is estimated to be 14.3% [19] and the\nestimated prevalence of tuberculosis in Zambia is 387 per\n100 000 population [20] with approximately 70% of TB\ninfection in Zambia related to HIV [21]. A study con-\nducted in Zambia in four PHC facilities found the preva-\nlence of common mental disorders to be 13.6%\n(diagnosed by DSM-IV criteria) [22]. A population-based\nH I Vs u r v e yi nZ a m b i af o u n dt h ep r e v a l e n c eo fm e n t a l\ndistress in HIV-infected individuals to be 20.8% [23].\nThe diagnosis of common mental disorders in TB and\nHIV-infected patients in PHC facilities is essential for\nimproving population health [24]. However, like many\nlow income countries, Zambia has a high attrition of\nhealth workers [25], and few are skilled in detecting\nMDDs and AUDs. In the effort to mitigate the health\nworker crisis in Africa, TB and HIV programs are task\nshifting care to lower cadre staff [26]. TB and HIV pro-\ngrams also need to integrate mental health [24] and\ninclude assessment of mental health disorders and their\nappropriate management [14] . Introducing screening\ntools for mental health that can be used by non-specia-\nlists or lay workers could make a dramatic contribution\nto the health sector’s ability to identify those in need of\nmental health support. Such screening tools however\nneed to be validated for the populations in which they\nare to be used.\nThe aim of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic\naccuracy and determine the optimum cut-off scores for\nclinical use of the Center for Epidemiological Studies\nDepression scale (CES-D) [27] and the Alcohol Use Dis-\norders Identification Test (AUDIT) [28] in detecting\nDSM-IV current MDD and AUD respectively, among\nTB patients on TB treatment and HIV patients on ART\nin PHC settings in Zambia. DSM-IV criteria for MDDs\nand AUDs were assessed using the Mini-International\nNeuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) [29] as the reference.\nMethods\nStudy design and setting\nThis was a cross-sectional study under the auspices of the\nZambia AIDS-Related TB (ZAMBART) Project. The\nstudy was conducted in PHC centres that provide both\nTB and HIV diagnoses and treatment. The TB/ART\nclinics within the PHC centres are serviced by clinical\nofficers and nurses, many of whom have limited training\nin screening for MDDs and AUDs. These centres cover\nboth urban and rural settings and are the first point of\nentry in the referral process for the majority of TB and\nHIV patients in the early stages of disease. Sixteen PHC\ncentres were selected for the study on the basis of high\nTB and HIV prevalence [30] and these are distributed in\nseven districts, of which Lusaka (the capital city) contains\nfour centres and the other six districts have two centres\neach. The size of the catchment area for these PHC cen-\ntres varied from 25,000 inhabitants in rural communities\nto 147,000 inhabitants in urban communities.\nTraining of the Field staff\nSixteen lay research assistants and ten mental health\nclinical assistants (mental health workers with a diploma\nin mental health), recruited from the study commu-\nnities, were trained separately over two days. On the\nfirst day, the lay research assistants were trained on how\nto screen for common mental disorders using the CES-\nD and AUDIT tools. On the second day the mental\nhealth clinical assistants were trained on how to diag-\nnose common mental disorders using the MINI. The\ntraining for both groups also covered information on\nthe study protocol, informed consent procedures, ethical\nconsiderations and data quality issues. The training was\nled by two psychiatrists, two TB/HIV specialists and a\ndata manager. Inter-rater reliability assessments formed\npart of this training. The intra-class correlation value for\ninterrater reliability of the lay research assistants was\n0.98 while that of the mental health clinical assistants\nwas 0.99. These results showed a high degree of inter-\nrater reliability in each group of field staff.\nParticipants\nEligible participants were aged 16 years or older, attend-\ning the TB or ART clinics of one of the 16 PHCs, and\nhad started TB treatment or ART during the month\nbefore the study. Patients with whom it was not possible\nto complete the informed consent procedures owing to\nserious medical illness were not eligible. Patients with\ndual TB and HIV infection were included, and data per-\ntaining to both TB therapy and ART were documented.\nProcedures\nA consecutive series of eligible patients were recruited\nfrom the PHC centres from December 2009 to January\n2010. Participants were informed about the study and\nasked to provide informed consent after which data col-\nlection commenced in two separate interviews which\nwere carried out on the same day of their routine clinic\nvisits. The first interview was a screening interview con-\nducted by the trained lay research assistants. Partici-\npants were screened for depression with the CES-D and\nexcessive alcohol use with the AUDIT. Socio-demo-\ngraphic data and HIV/TB clinical data were also\nobtained in this interview. DSM IV criteria were\nassessed using the MINI in a second interview con-\nducted by the trained mental health clinical assistants.\nConfirmatory clinical data on TB treatment and ART\nChishinga et al. BMC Psychiatry 2011, 11:75\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-244X/11/75\nPage 2 of 10\nstatus were also obtained in this second interview from\nthe participants ’ medical records. The trained mental\nhealth clinical assistants co nducting the second inter-\nview with the MINI were blinded to all data collected\nby the trained lay research assistants conducting the\nfirst interview with the CES-D and AUDIT. We chose\nthe CES-D and AUDIT because they are brief, easy to\nadminister and have been widely used in cross-cultural\nstudies, including African settings [31].\nReference standard\nThe MINI was used as the‘gold-standard’ in generating\npsychiatric diagnoses. The MINI is a short, structured\ndiagnostic interview that was developed in 1990 by psy-\nchiatrists and clinicians in the United States and Europe\nfor DSM-IV psychiatric disorders [29]. The MINI is\ndivided into modules, each corresponding to a diagnos-\ntic category. For the purposes of this study, only mod-\nules covering current MDD and AUDs were selected.\nDSM-IV criteria have been used in previous studies in\nZambia [22,23].\nScreening tools\nThe CES-D is a self-report scale with 20 items designed\nto measure depressive symptoms in general population\nsamples. Each item is assigned a value 0-4. There are\nfour items that are positive-worded that have to be\nreverse scored, before computing the total score by add-\ning each of the 20 items. The minimum score is 0 and\nt h em a x i m u ms c o r ei s6 0 .T h eC E S - Dm e a s u r e sc o m -\nmon symptoms of major depression, including depres-\nsive mood, feelings of guilt and worthlessness,\npsychomotor retardation, loss of appetite, and sleep dis-\nturbance within the week prior to the interview. A score\nof 16 and above in the general population suggests\nsymptoms of depression [27]. Reliability, validity, and\nfactor structure have been found to be similar across a\nwide variety of demographic characteristics in general\npopulation samples that hav e been tested [32,33]. In\nUganda, the CES-D has been used to assess the preva-\nlence of depression in HIV infected individuals, although\nit was not validated in this population [8].\nThe AUDIT was developed by the World Health\nOrganisation (WHO) as a simple method of screening\nfor excessive alcohol consumption in the past 12\nmonths [28,34]. It consists of 10 questions on recent\nalcohol use (items 1-3), alcohol dependency syndromes\n(items 4-6) and alcohol-related problems (items 7-10).\nEach of the 10 questions is rated on a four-point scale.\nThe total score ranges from 0 to 40. A total score of 8\nor more is recommended as an indicator of hazardous\ndrinking behaviour [34].The AUDIT was developed and\nvalidated in multinational samples involving Kenya [28]\nand has been validated in South Africa [31].\nTranslation of the MINI and screening tools\nThe MINI, CES-D and AUDIT were translated to the\ndominant languages (Bemba, Nyanja, Tonga and Lozi)\nin the study communities. The translated questionnaires\nwere forward-translated by professional translators\nworking for the Zambia National Broadcasting Corpora-\ntion (ZNBC). The forward-translated instruments were\nthen back-translated into English by community repre-\nsentatives with experience in the translation of research\nquestionnaires. Discrepancies in conceptual and seman-\ntic equivalence were resolved through an informal com-\nmittee consensus approach with both forward and back-\ntranslators. Following on all this, all translated versions\nof the questionnaires were discussed by the research\nteam; comprising members who were fluent in the\nnative languages, until fin al versions of the question-\nnaires were agreed upon. These instruments were tested\nbefore use in the field.\nDefinition of cases\nThe sample was categorised into cases and non-cases of\npsychiatric disorders based on the MINI outputs of (i)\ncurrent MDD and (ii) AUD.\nAnalysis\nData were analysed using Stata 11 (College Station,\nTexas, USA). Median total scores on the CES-D and\nAUDIT respectively were compared against MINI-\ndefined diagnoses using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.\nThe internal consistency of these screening tools was\nassessed using Cronbach’s alpha. We used confirmatory\nfactor analysis to examine how a four-factor model of\n‘depressive symptoms ’, ‘somatic symptoms ’, ‘positive\nexperiences’ and ‘interpersonal difficulties’ for the CES-\nD [27], and a two-factor model of‘alcohol consumption’\nand ‘alcohol related problems ’ for the AUDIT [35] fit\nthe observed data. We used a combination of the chi-\nsquare to degrees of freedom ratio ( c\n2/df) of <2;\nTucker-Lewis index (TLI) and Comparative fit index\n(CFI) of >0.95, and Standardized Root Mean-Square\nResidual (SRMR) of <0.08 as our rule of thumb for\ngoodness of fit of the models [36].\nNon-parametric area under the receiver operating\ncharacteristic curve (AUROC) analyses were performed\nto estimate the diagnostic accuracy of the screening\ntools [37]. Cut-off scores that simultaneously gave high\nsensitivity and high PPV were selected [38]. The data\nfor the AUDIT was stratified by gender as previous\nresearch had shown that cut-off for the AUDIT was\ngender specific [39,40].\nEthical Considerations\nThe study was approved by the University of Zambia\nBiomedical Research Ethics committee and endorsed by\nChishinga et al. BMC Psychiatry 2011, 11:75\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-244X/11/75\nPage 3 of 10\nthe Ministry of Health in Zambia. Written informed\nconsent for participation and publication was obtained\nfrom the patients prior to the commencement of any\nstudy related procedures. Data were collected anon-\nymously and all participants were identified by a unique\nstudy code. The questionnaires and electronic database\nwere linked by these unique barcodes that were kept\nseparately in a password protected database.\nResults\nCharacteristics of the participants\nSeven hundred and forty four patients participated in\nthe first interview with the CES-D and AUDIT. Of\nthese, 649 patients (87.2%) completed the MINI diag-\nnostic interview (Figure 1). There was little evidence of\na difference in age (p = 0.45), gender (p = 0.12), median\nCES-D score (p = 0.47) or median AUDIT score (p =\n0.49) between those who did, and did not, complete the\nMINI diagnostic interview. Of the 649 participants who\ncompleted the MINI diagnostic interview, the majority\n(77%) were recruited at TB clinics, and of these, 54%\nwere also HIV positive (Table 1).\nInternal consistency\nThe internal consistency of the CES-D and AUDIT was\nhigh (Cronbach ’s a = 0.84 and 0.98 respectively). The\nScreened with CES-D and AUDIT \nClinically assessed with the MINI \nPatients available for \nMINI (n=649) \nTB and ART patients \n(n=744) \n95 patients did not \nhave time to be \nassessed with the \nMINI (Women=49, \nMen=46) \nCurrent major \ndepressive disorder \n(current MDD) n=62 \nAlcohol use \ndisorder  \n(AUD) n=96 \nFigure 1Diagram of participant flow.\nChishinga et al. BMC Psychiatry 2011, 11:75\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-244X/11/75\nPage 4 of 10\ngoodness of fit indices for the CES-D suggest that the\nfour-factor model did not fit the observed data well.\nEven though thec2/df ratio was below 2 and SRMR was\nclose to the desirable region (<0.08), the TLI and CFI\nfor the four-factor CES-D model were below 0.95. The\nfactor loadings for each CES-D item and the inter-corre-\nlation among the four factors were low (Table 2). The\ngoodness of fit indices for the two-factor AUDIT shows\nthat the c\n2/df ratio, SRMR, TLI and CFI criterion were\nmet. Thus the two-factor AUDIT model fits the\nobserved data well. The factor loadings for each AUDIT\nitem were high indicating that the correlation between\neach item and the respective latent factor was high\n(Table 3).\nCase detection properties\nCES-D scores tended to be higher among MINI-defined\ncurrent MDD cases than non-MDD cases (median 28\nvs. 18; p < 0.001). Similarly, the AUDIT scores were\nhigher among MINI-defined AUD cases than non-cases\n(median 22 vs.12; p < 0.001). The AUDIT scores were\nalso higher among MINI-defined AUD cases than non-\ncases for women (median 24 vs.10; P < 0.001) and men\n(median 20 vs.13; p < 0.001) respectively.\nThe CES-D and AUDIT showed good discrimination in\ndetecting current MDD and AUD cases from non-cases\nrespectively (AUROC for CES-D = 0.78, and for AUDIT =\n0.98 for women and 0.75 for men respectively), indicating\nthat these were accurate screening tools. The difference in\nperformance of the AUDIT was significantly better for\nwomen than for men (p < 0.0001) (Figure 2).\nFor each CES-D and AUDIT, cut-off points, sensitivity\nand PPV were obtained (Figure 3). The optimum cut-off\nscore of the CES-D in screening for current MDD was\n22. This achieved a sensitivity of 73% and PPV of 76%\n(Figure 3A). For the AUDIT, the optimum cut-off score\nfor screening AUDs was 24 for women (sensitivity of\n60% and PPV of 60%), and 20 for men (sensitivity of\n55% and PPV of 50%) (Figure 3B).\nDiscussion\nThis study shows that the CES-D and AUDIT are reli-\nable and valid instruments to use among TB and HIV\npatients in primary care. Using a singular construct to\ntest for internal consisten cy, we found that the Cron-\nbach’sa l p h aw a s0 . 8 4f o rt h eC E S - Da n d0 . 9 8f o rt h e\nAUDIT. This indicates that the participants showed\nadequate consistency in their responses. These high\nestimates are similar to previous studies performed on\nthe CES-D [27] and the AUDIT [41]. The four-factor\nmodel for the CES-D did not fit the data well. This\nmeans that the latent four factors in the CES-D were\nmis-specified. The two-factor model for the AUDIT\nshowed the desired goodness of fit. This indicates that\nthe two factors in the AUDIT could be considered as\nsubscales.\nThe AUROCs for the CES-D and AUDIT (for both\nwomen and men) were high in detecting current MDD\nand AUDs from non-cases respectively. These findings\nare in keeping with a validation study conducted among\nHIV-infected person in South Africa that found the\nCES-D and AUDIT performed well in accurately discri-\nminating MINI-defined current MDD (AUROC curve\n0.76) and AUD (AUROC 0.96) respectively [31]. The\nbetter accuracy of the AUDIT in women agrees with\nother studies [39,40].\nA highly sensitive test is needed for screening exami-\nnations in routine clinical care to identify potential\ncases, while a highly specific test is best in a confirma-\ntory role. Of the cases identified by a screening test, few\nshould be false positives (i.e. have high PPV) so that the\nexpense and morbidity of fur ther evaluation of false\npositive results are reduced in settings that already have\nlimited resources [38]. In our study, both the CES-D\nand AUDIT met the criterion of having cut-off scores\nthat simultaneously have moderate to high sensitivities\nand PPVs. At a cut-off of 22, the CES-D yielded a sensi-\ntivity of 73% and PPV of 76% for current MDD. Simi-\nlarly, at a cut-of score of 24 for women and 20 for men,\nthe AUDIT yielded a sensitivity of 60% and PPV of 60%\nfor women, and a sensitivity of 55% and PPV of 50%\nmen for AUDs. The sensitivities of the AUDIT were\nmoderate (55% sensitivity for men; 60% for women),\nTable 1 Characteristics of the study participants enrolled\nfrom 16 PHC centres in Zambia\nTotal (N = 649)\nSocio-demographics\nMedian age (years) (IQR) 33 (28-40)\nFemale (%) 286 (44.1)\nMarried (%)\nsingle 173 (26.6)\nmarried 304 (46.8)\nwidowed 80 (12.3)\ndivorced 92 (14.2)\nEducation (%)\nNo education 55 (8.5)\nPrimary 253 (39.0)\nSecondary 341 (52.5)\nEmployed (%) 271 (41.8)\nScreening tools\nMedian CES-D score (IQR) 19 (15-26)\nMedian AUDIT score (IQR) 15 (10-23)\nMedian AUDIT score for Men (IQR) 16 (11-23)\nMedian AUDIT score for Women (IQR) 11 (5-22)\nThe median AUDIT score was higher for men than for women (median 16 vs.\n11; p = 0.04).\nMINI, Mini - International Neuropsychiatric Interview; IQR, inter-quartile range.\nChishinga et al.

Also, the PPVs of the AUDIT were moderate\n(50% for men; 60% for women), indicating that those\nwho screened positive about half were actually cases.\nT h ec u t - o f f sw e r eh i g hc o m p a r e dt ot h eC E S - Dc u t - o f f\nof 16 [27] and AUDIT cut-offs of 8 [34] found in the\ngeneral population. This discrepancy may indicate that\nour study population may have a greater likelihood of\nhaving current MDD and hazardous alcohol drinking\nthan the general population. The high cut-offs may also\nreflect greater severity of current MDD and alcohol pro-\nblems among our study participants; these may need\nintensive interventions.\nDespite the available infra structure for psychiatric\nadmissions and outpatient care, most health facilities in\nZambia do not have adequate health workers to treat\ndepression and alcohol use disorders. We therefore\nrecommend that individuals with high AUDIT or CES-\nD scores in this setting be offered treatment in accor-\ndance with the WHO Mental Health Gap Action Pro-\ngramme (mhGAP) [42]. The mhGAP is a tool designed\nby the WHO to be used in PHC settings where health\nworkers have limited training in Psychiatry. The\nmhGAP guidelines for depression include offering psy-\nchoeducation to the patient on the importance of conti-\nnuing activities that used to be interesting for them and\nmaintaining regular sleep cycles; physical activity; social\nactivity and scheduled visits with the primary care pro-\nfessional when thoughts of suicide or self-harm arise.\nThe guidelines also indicate the need to address the cur-\nrent psycho-social stressors for the patient by giving\nthem the opportunity to talk about what they think are\nthe causes of the symptoms they have, and by identify-\ning family members who could help them solve these\nTable 2 Factor loadings matrices of a CES-D model, inter-correlation among factors and goodness of fit indices\nFactor 1\ndepressed\nFactor 2\nSomatic\nFactor 3\npositive\nexperiences\nFactor 4\nInterpersonal\ndifficulties\nItem\n1.

Furthermore, they indicate the need to identify\nthe patient ’s prior physical activities, so that if these\nactivities are re-initiated, they would have the potential\nfor providing psycho-social support. Lastly, the guide-\nlines indicate that if cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT)\nis available, it should be used on patient during sched-\nuled visits at the clinic.\nThe mhGAP guidelines for those with alcohol use dis-\norders include discussing with the patient the short and\nlong-term risks of continued use of alcohol; asking\nabout other substance use; h aving a discussion about\ntheir reasons for alcohol use, and providing examples of\nways that the harmful or hazardous use of alcohol could\nbe reduced. If the patient fails to respond or is sus-\npected to have alcohol dependence, they should be\nreferred to a specialist for further diagnostic evaluation\nand possible treatment for alcohol dependence. For\nthose who score lower on the AUDIT, a Brief Drinker\nProfile [43] can be performed which measures quality\nand frequency of drinking in the previous month, and\nadvice given on the effects of alcohol consumption on\nmedication.\nGeneralisability of our findings is limited to TB and\nHIV patients on treatment in PHC centres. Further\nmeasures of depression and AUDs at a general popula-\ntion level in Zambia may be needed so that the diagnos-\ntic accuracy of CES-D and AUDIT test results among\nTable 3 Factor loadings matrices of an AUDIT model, inter-correlation among factors and goodness of fit indices\nFactor 1\nAlcohol\nconsumption\nFactor 2\nAlcohol\nrelated\nproblems\nItem\n1.
