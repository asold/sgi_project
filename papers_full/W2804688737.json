    "abstract": "This paper is a review of recent developments in solid-state linear transformer driver (SSLTD) for applications to pulsed power generation. It summarizes the technological advances reported by previous publications and interprets the experimental progresses. The application of solid-state LTDs has been proved to be an attractive approach to make compact and repetitive pulsed power generators that have been sought by a variety of industrial applications and scientific researches. Their advantages and disadvantages compared with their alternatives are reported and analyzed in this paper. Future technical trends of solid-state LTDs are also discussed.",
