It is essential to understand the \ninteractions between artificial individuals based on  LLMs2 and the societies in which humans and artificial \nindividuals coexist.\nModeling approaches to the evolution of social populations have primarily been discussed within the frame-\nwork of evolutionary game  theory3,4, using mathematical and computational methods such as replicator dynamics \nand agent-based models. The evolution of behavioral strategies in the Prisoner’s Dilemma as an abstraction of \nsocial conflict is a seminal example. It has provided general insights into the evolution of cooperation in biologi-\ncal organisms and human  society5,6.\nConventional models of the evolution of cooperative behavior have typically described specific actions in \nparticular situations as direct representation of individual genes. However, such behaviors often stem from \nhigher-order psychological or cognitive traits, including intentions, personality, and preferences. In psychology, \nthe widely accepted “Big Five” model categorizes personality traits into five dimensions: Openness to Experience, \nConscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness and  Neuroticism7. However, translating these traits into specific \nbehaviors in diverse social contexts remains challenging, especially in mathematical and computational models.\nThis study aims to demonstrate that LLMs can empower research on the evolution of human behavior, based \non evolutionary game theory, by using an evolutionary model positing that instructing LLMs with high-level \npsychological and cognitive character descriptions enables the simulation of human behavior choices in game-\ntheoretical scenarios.

Phelps and Russell examined how \nGPT-3.5 operationalizes natural language descriptions of motivations, including competitiveness and altruism, \netc., in social  dilemmas8. Using prompts that described varying attitudes, they showed that LLMs can adequately \ninterpret and demonstrate these traits in behavior, though with some limitations. We use natural language to \nrepresent personality trait genes in the model, which can be translated into behavioral traits by using LLMs.\nWe evolve such genes through a mutation method also employing the LLM. Meyerson et al. recently used \nLLMs for crossovers in evolutionary computation, by inputting several patterns as parents to LLM to generate \ntheir offspring  patterns9. They showed evolution of diverse patterns, including binary strings, sentences, and \nPython code. We adopt similar concept but with a simpler method to mutate genes represented as natural \nlanguage descriptions to evolve population of personality trait genes.\nFurthermore, this level of personality description and generation of their behavioral traits enables the model \nto deal with evolution not only in specific game-theoretical situations but also in other game-theoretical contexts, \nas well as in any context that can be described linguistically.\nThis paper addresses the following research questions to clarify the significance of the proposed model: \n(1) How can behavioral traits generated from genes represented in natural language using the LLM-based \nmethod reflect genes’ cooperative tendency and consistency? (2) Can the proposed model exhibit the complex \nevolutionary dynamics of the emergence of personality traits for cooperative behavior, and if so, how do these \ndynamics play out in a typical trial? (3) What are the statistical properties and the dynamics of the evolution \nprocess in the proposed model, and how do these compare with those of a control model that directly encodes \nbehavioral traits in genes? (4) Which words emerge in the evolving population of personality traits, and how \ndo they affect individual behaviors? By answering these questions, we demonstrate how the proposed model \ncan contribute to the understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of personality traits from a new perspective \nbased on the use of LLM.\nRelated works\nThere are several related studies in different directions. Recent research includes investigations into the cognitive \nfunctions of LLMs, such as theory of  mind10 and  metacognition11, as well as their behavior and learning in game-\ntheoretic  environments8,12 and the big five personality  traits13. In particular, Akata et al. utilized behavioral game \ntheory to study the cooperation and coordination behavior of LLMs by asking them to choose a strategy for \nrepeated 2x2 games. They found that GPT-4 behaves like a trigger strategy in the repeated Prisoner’s Dilemma, \nalways defecting after an opponent has defected only once. Phelps and Russell investigated the ability of GPT-3.5 \nto operationalize natural language descriptions of competitive, altruistic, self-interested, and mixed-motivation \nattitudes in social  dilemmas8. They created LLM agents with distinct prompts to represent their cooperative \nand competitive attitudes. They found that LLMs can interpret natural language descriptions of altruism and \nselfishness in that they can appropriately reflect the attitudes in their behavior to some extent, but have limitations.\nRegarding emergent interactions among LLM agents, Park et al. presented an interactive generative agent-\nbased sandbox  environment2. Agents in an RPG-like 2D environment could produce emergent social behaviors \nsuch as autonomously spreading invitations to a party and arriving at the party at the right time. Their study \ndemonstrated the possibility of creating realistic simulations of human behavior by combining large language \nmodels with interactive computational agents.\nLLMs have been shown to improve the effectiveness of evolutionary algorithms. Some studies use LLM as \noperators for mutations and crossovers, bringing creativity and open-endedness to evolutionary  computation9,14. \nFor example, Meyerson et al. introduced a language model crossover method using few-shot prompting, where \nmultiple parent patterns are fed into an LLM as a prompt to produce new, related offspring  patterns9. They have \nsuccessfully evolved binary bit strings, sentences, equations, text-to-image prompts, and Python code. There is \nalso research on evolutionary search in the latent space of generative  models15. Although the above studies are \nrelated to our proposed model in several aspects, they do not focus on the evolutionary dynamics of traits in \nsocial groups of LLM agents.\nOn the other hand, there has been a preliminary study to the cultural evolution of chatting agents’ topics using \n LLMs16–18.  In18, agents in an abstract 2D social space use their topic words as part of the prompt for an LLM to \nproduce Japanese utterances related to the topics. They approach/avoid from others according to the similarity \nof their utterances. They found that individuals who spoke about positive topics were more likely to sustain their \nexisting group compared to those who spoke about negative topics. It was also shown that novel topics could \nemerge and evolve through the cultural evolution of topics based on the propagation of topics picked up from \nthe utterances of neighboring  individuals16–18. This result suggests that such an evolutionary model with LLMs \ncan directly address the effects of agents’ vocabulary on their group behavior and the emergence and evolution \nof their behavioral diversity.\nIn addition, Suzuki et al. proposed a research framework for understanding the evolutionary and ecologi-\ncal roles of acoustic behaviors by combining agent-based modeling and a generative model, focusing on bird \n vocalizations19,20. In this framework, the latent space of a generative model, specifically a variational autoen-\ncoder, is used to represent a genotype space of bird vocalization spectrograms. The spectrogram generated from \na genotype (i.e., the latent vector) is considered as a corresponding phenotype within the evolutionary model. \nThe framework further observes the roles of the evolved phenotypes in natural ecological settings through field \nexperiments. They conducted an evolutionary experiment of sexual selection on male bird vocalizations and \nfemale preferences, resulting in a diverse stable coexistence of multiple distinct vocalizations and preferences not \nobserved in an abstract version of the  model21. This result implies that a complex representation of phenotypes \nbased on a generative model can produce complex evolutionary scenarios.\n3\nVol.:(0123456789)Scientific Reports |         (2024) 14:5989  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-55903-y\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nMethods\nWe consider a population of N  agents. As shown in Fig.  1, each agent has an English sentence describing its \npersonality trait related to defection and cooperation, described in approximately 10 words, as a gene. The game \ntheoretical behavior of each agent is determined by its personality trait. We use a chat-type LLM to extract a \ndeterministic strategy of the iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma with memory length 4 based on its gene. The prompt \nfor the LLM describes the focal individual’s personality trait, the context and payoffs in the repeated Prisoner’s \nDilemma game, the history of the last two actions of both the focal individual and their opponent, and a request \nto determine its next action (“I choose Strategy A (or B)”). Figure  2 (left) shows an example prompt where \nthe personality trait gene is “Open to team efforts, but self-interest frequently overrides collective goals. ” and \nthe actions of the first round were DD and DC (Strategy A = Cooperation: C, Strategy B = Defection: D). The \nresponse of the LLM was “I choose Strategy B” (= defection), which means that this behavioral trait defects in \nthe next round if the history of actions is DD→DC. We obtain a response for all possible ( 24 = 16 ) combinations \nof actions in the history.\nIn practice, the next action may not be explicitly described in the response from the LLM; in such a case, the \ninput to the LLM is repeated and the response is regenerated until the action becomes identifiable. However, if \nthe appropriate response is not obtained after a predetermined number of regenerations ( M), a random action \nis selected and assigned for this combination of actions in the history. The above behavioral trait is determined \nand stored only once for a unique personality trait gene. The existing behavioral trait is used for subsequent \noccurrences of the same gene within the population for simplicity and reduced computational cost.\nWe conduct an evolutionary experiment across G  generations using roulette wheel selection. Offspring for \neach subsequent generation are stochastically reproduced in proportion to the agents’ fitness: the average payoff  \nreceived by each individual in a round-robin tournament, where each game consists of K rounds. We introduce \nnoise, which causes an agent to play the opposite of the intended action with a certain probability pn . For the \ninitial rounds, the action is determined based on a randomly generated history.\nMutations occur with a probability pm . Figure 2 (right) shows an example prompt for mutating the original \npersonality trait gene “Open to team efforts, but self-interest frequently overrides collective goals. ” towards \ncooperation. As depicted in the figure, we instructed the LLM that the target gene describes a character of \na person, and then directed it to partially rephrase the gene within 10 words by varying the tone towards \ncooperative (or selfish) tendencies. The resultant description was “Collaborative spirit with a dash of self-\nmotivation. ” . The decision to vary the tone towards cooperative or selfish one was made randomly.\nExperiments and analyses\nWe used N = 30, K = 20, M=10, pm = 0.05, pn = 0.05, G = 1000, and set the payoffs for the Prisoner’s dilemma to \nR (reward) = 4, T (temptation to defect) = 5, S (sucker’s payoff) = 0, and P (punishment) = 1. We used  LLaMA222 \nby Meta, which is a collection of pretrained and fine-tuned generative text models. Specifically, we adopted a \npublicly available version, on Huggingface (TheBloke/Llama-2-13b-Chat-GPTQ (https:// huggi ngface. co/ TheBl \noke/ Llama-2- 13B- chat- GPTQ), of the fine-tuned model with 13 billion parameters, optimized for dialogue use \nFigure 1.

See Fig. 2 for examples of the prompts used.\n4\nVol:.(1234567890)Scientific Reports |         (2024) 14:5989  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-55903-y\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\ncases, and its size was reduced by using  GPTQ23, a weight quantization method. We used the default parameter \nvalues for text generation with the LLM except (temperature = 0.9, max_new_tokens = 8) for behavioral trait \ngeneration and (temperature=0.5, max_new_tokens=53) for mutation operations). We assigned one of the seven \nvarying personality genes to each individual in the initial population, which were generated by ChatGPT-4. The \nexperiments did not involve any human participants.\nGeneration of behavioral traits from personality trait genes\nFirst, we analyzed how behavioral traits generated from genes described with natural language using the LLM-\nbased method can reflect their cooperative tendency and consistency. We generated behavioral traits for each \nof the 7 personality trait genes in the initial population 50 times. Subsequently, we calculated the proportion of \ncooperative actions for each of the 16 possible histories, over the resulting 50 behavioral traits, as shown in Fig. 3. \nThe descriptions of personality trait genes gradually range from more selfish (top) to more cooperative (bottom).\nThe behavioral traits have a general tendency: agents tend to choose cooperation as the number of cooperative \nactions in the history increases. At the same time, more cooperative (or selfish) personality genes tended to \nproduce cooperative (or selfish) actions more frequently, as indicated by the average proportion of cooperation \nover all histories (labeled as avg in the graph). Individuals with extreme personality traits, influenced by either \ncooperative or selfish genes, tend to exhibit more consistent behaviors, with their average cooperation rate \napproaching either around 0.1 (top) or 0.7 (bottom). In contrast, those with more balanced genes show a \nmore stochastic nature, typically showing an intermediate degree of cooperative behavior. Such consistency \nand stochasticity themselves may reflect the behavioral nature of personality traits. However, in the interest \nof computational feasibility, we omit measurement of such stochastic effects in subsequent experiments in this \nstudy.\nEvolutionary dynamics of personality traits\nWe ran 15 trials of the evolutionary experiment. As shown in Fig.  4, to illustrate how the proposed evolution-\nary model, composed of LLM-based genotype-phenotype mapping and mutation, can realize the evolutionary \nprocess of personality traits described in natural language, we discuss one representive trial in detail.\nFigure 4 (left) shows the proportion of cooperation (pc) in each generation of the focal trial. This shows a \nclear switching pattern between cooperation and defection over the course of evolution. The figure shows that \nthe pc initially decreased and remained low, around 0.05, until about the 300th generation. It then increased \nrapidly to about 0.55 around the 350th generation and decreased to about 0.40 around the 450th generation. \nThe pc then underwent gradual increases and decreases, reaching its highest value of about 0.75 around the \n850th generation, followed by a rapid drop to 0.15 around the 900th generation. Figure  4 (right) shows the \ndistribution and transition of the average genes for every 10 generations, with personality trait genes projected \nonto 2D space. We performed the projection by vectorizing the personality trait genes using the Sentence \nTransformer on Huggingface (sentence transformers/parameters-MiniLM-L6-v2 (https:// huggi ngface. co/ sente \nnce- trans forme rs/ parap hrase- MiniLM- L6- v2)), and then compressed the resulting vectors to 2D space using \nFigure 2.  Prompts used for generating a behavioral trait (left) and mutating a gene (right). The prompts were \ngenerated by following the standard format of LLaMA2.\n5\nVol.:(0123456789)Scientific Reports |         (2024) 14:5989  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-55903-y\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nthe  UMAP24 dimensionality reduction algorithm. We plotted the average vector for every 10 generations on a \ntwo-dimensional plane. The color of a symbol indicates the pc in the corresponding generation. The dominant \ngenes in several distinctive generations were displayed.\nThe personality traits are associated with defection toward the upper left and cooperation toward the lower \nright in the 2D space. Thus, this vectorized and dimensionally compressed space of personality traits reflects a \ngradation of behavioral traits from cooperative to selfish. In the first stage, the population evolved toward selfish \npersonality traits from the center-left to the upper center. The dominant personality trait (1: “Pursues personal \ngain consistently, neglecting mutual or group benefits entirely. ”) selected almost exclusively the defection strategy \n(DDDDDDDDDDDCDDDD) at this stage. After a while, the population evolved to be cooperative and domi -\nnated by a more cooperative trait (2: “Prioritizes collective achievements, personal growth ensues. ” (DDDCD-\nDCDCDDCCCCC)). However, the population moved and wandered around the center and the center-left, \nindicating instability of the cooperative relationship in the population, which caused the population to evolve to \nbe less cooperative (3: “Prioritizes personal growth, team achievements take a backseat. ” (DDDCDDDDDDCC-\nCDCC)). Then, another more cooperative personality with slightly different behavioral strategies (4: “Prioritizes \ngrowth and mutual wins through synergetic collaboration. ” (DCCCDDDCCCDCCCCC)) emerged and domi-\nnated the population, resulting in highly cooperative relationships that moved the population to the center-right \nin the space. The population further evolved to the most cooperative phase (6: “Thrives in teamwork, prioritizing \nshared growth and success. ” (DCCCDDDCDCDCCCCC)), moving to the lower right, with occasional invasions \nby less cooperative ones (5: “Values collaboration for personal gain and growth. ” (DDCCDDDDDDDDCCCC)). \nHowever, the intrusion of a personality trait of almost all defections (7: “Prioritizes personal success and growth \nat all costs. ” (DDCCDDDDDDDDCCCC)) led the population to the center-left. Overall, the population evolves \nthrough gradually changing personality expressions ranging from selfish to cooperative.\nFigure 3.

The bar graph shows \nthe proportion of cooperative actions generated for each of the 16 possible histories, over 50 behavioral traits \ngenerated from each of the personality trait genes.\n6\nVol:.(1234567890)Scientific Reports |         (2024) 14:5989  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-55903-y\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nStatistical properties of the evolution process and comparison with a control experiment \nbased on a direct representation of behavioral traits in genes\nFigure  5 shows (a) the frequency distribution of the proportion of cooperation and (b) the cosine distance \nbetween the average vectors for each 20-generation interval across the 15 trials, to statistically quantify the \ncooperative tendency and the stability of the population, respectively. Figure (c) and (d) show the trajectory \nof the population’s average gene vector in the 2D space over 15 trials, colored by the ID of the trial (c) and the \nproportion of cooperation in each generation (pc) (d). The trial in Fig. 4 corresponds to trial 13.\nThe frequency distribution in Fig.  5a,b shows that the average proportion of cooperation was 0.31, with \nits highest peak frequency at around 0.18, and there was a fat tail toward higher values, indicating that the \npopulation tended to be dominated by defecting strategies, while cooperative individuals occasionally invaded \nthe population. The average cosine distance was 0.05, with a very high peak at around 0.02, meaning that the \npopulation tended to be stagnant for most generations.\nWhile the meaning of the space compressed by UMAP is not self-evident, Fig. 5c illustrates that there are large \nvariations in the distribution of the plots across trials, indicating that the emerging genes were different between \ntrials. We further observed that in between significant temporal changes, the population tended to stagnate and \nconverge in local areas of the space. Figure 5d also reveals that, for the converged states dominated by defecting \nstrategies, linguistic features vary substantially between trials. Conversely, cooperation-dominated states are \nseen to overlap more, clustring in the upper right regions. These could indicate that there are shared features \nbetween personality traits that produce cooperative relationships, while selfish traits may have more variety in \ntheir expressions.\nTo clarify the intrinsic dynamics of personality trait evolution, we conducted control experiments in which \nthe string encoding of an individual’s behavioral trait is used both as the individual’s genotype and phenotype. \nFigure 4.

Figure  6c,d shows the trajectory of the \npopulation’s average gene vector in the 2D space over 15 trials, colored by the ID of the trial (c) and the proportion \nof cooperation in each generation (pc) (d). We used the list of values composing the behavioral trait, assuming \nD=0 and C=1, as the corresponding vector to be processed in the UMAP projection.\nThe frequency distribution in Fig.  6a,b shows that the average proportion of cooperation was 0.50, with its \npeak frequencies at around 0.5 and 0.7, indicating that the population tended to be occupied by more cooperative \nstrategies than that in the original model in Fig. 5. Also, the average cosine distance was 0.07, while its interme-\ndiate peak was at around 0.02, meaning that the population tended to be less stagnant than that in the original \nmodel. Also, the trajectories tended to overlap, meaning there was less variation in the distribution between \ntrials, and each trajectory tended to move more gradually and evenly throughout the space. This tendency is \nthought to be due to evolution based on mutations in the behavioral gene, which directly flips the values in the \nbehavioral traits one by one. In other words, the large difference in the trajectories between trials in the original \nmodel (Fig. 5) was due to the evolution of words or phrases in the linguistic description of personal traits, which \ncan produce both large and small change in the behavioral traits. This allows the population to remain stable at \nsome times, and change drastically at others.\nEmerging words in the evolving personality traits and their effects on individual behaviors\nFinally, we analyzed which words emerged in the evolving population of personality traits, and how they affected \nindividual behavior. To understand which words in personality trait genes significantly influenced cooperative \nbehavior, game outcome, and fitness, we calculated several indices as follows: For each word present in the gene \nof each individual across all trials, we assigned the proportion of cooperation (pc), the distribution over all action \npairs ((DD (mutual defection), DC (successfully defected), CD (being defected), CC (mutual cooperation) in \nall rounds), and the fitness of the focal individual, to the word. The indices were then averaged for each word. \nTable 1 shows the five top-ranked words that marked the highest value for each index. For example, the highest \nranked word “skepticism (0.261)” in the DC category indicates that agents whose personality trait gene included \n“skepticism” had a successful defection rate (DC) of about 26% in all rounds. We limit our analysis to words \n(in Table 1) that appeared in the genes of at least 500 individuals across all trials. We expect that these words \nsignificantly affected the evolutionary dynamics in terms of several aspects of the behavior and interactions of \nagents.\nOverall, the prominent words reflect the attributes of each index, indicating that the words appearing in \nthe evolved personality trait genes correspond to behavioral tendencies as per their semantic meanings. For \nthe pc category, the top words were “gently” , “fosters” , “establishes” , and “harmony” which relate to cultivating \ngood mutual relationships. On the other hand, words related to self-interest and speculative tendencies, such \nas “trampling” , “trumps” , “disregard” , “blatant” and “skepticism, ” ranked high in the DD and DC categories. \nThe words “caring”  and “genuinely” ranked high in the DC category because the traits in between selfish and \naltruistic like “Prioritizes personal growth and recognition, genuinely caring for others’ feelings. ” enabled the \nindividuals to defect successfully. Words such as “good” and “unwavering” ranked high in the CD categories, \nsuggesting that such a generous personality may not be successful in this context. “environments” and “thrives” \nranked the highest in the CC category, presumably because the gene “Prioritizes team achievements with personal \ndevelopment in mind, thriving in collaborative environments. ” exhibited extremely high mutual cooperation. \nInterestingly, the above “caring” and “genuinely” , which benefits from successful defection, and “environments” , \n“thrives” and “enthusiastically” , which benefits from mutual cooperation, coexisted in the fitness category.\nFigure 6.

The experiments and analyses clarified that \n1) behavioral traits generated from natural language descriptions of personality traits using the proposed method \nsuccessfully and consistently reflected behavioral tendency affecting cooperation; 2) The evolutionary process \nof such higher-level description of personality traits exhibited emergence of cooperative behavior based on the \ndiverse and complex representation of personality traits, with recurrent occurrences of cooperative and selfish \npersonality traits. 3) However, in comparison to control experiments using a genotype that directly encodes \nbehavioral traits, the population displayed increased stagnation in defection-dominated states, with occasional \nemergence of cooperative behaviors; 4) The words that emerged in the evolved genes reflected the behavioral \ntendencies of their associated personalities in terms of semantics, thereby influencing individual behavior and, \nconsequently, the evolutionary dynamics.\nThere are several future research directions, such as analyzing the current model in more detail, comparing \ntrials with different language models, extending and refining the game processes between agents by making them \nmore interactive, introducing different game theoretical settings to investigate the evolutionary role of personal-\nity in different contexts, and incorporating human intervention into the model to study possible evolutionary \nscenarios of human-AI interactions in complex social contexts.\nThe LLM derives choices in game theory from descriptions of personality traits in this study. It has been shown \nthat there is a certain correlation between personality traits and choices in game-theoretical situations. However, \nthe extent to which the predictions of LLMs are consistent with this correlation remains unclear. This is also an \nimportant point of discussion related to the foundation of this study and is a subject for future consideration.\nBy incorporating generative models into the representation of phenotypes in evolutionary models, we believe \nthat we can make the models, previously simpler than the real world, as complex as the real world, allowing us \nto explore novel and realistic scenarios arising from the evolutionary dynamics of complex and diverse traits. \nThe proposed model and experimental analysis in this paper is a first step in this direction.\nData availability\nThe datasets used and/or analysed during the current study available from the corresponding author on reason-\nable request.\nReceived: 21 October 2023; Accepted: 28 February 2024\nReferences\n 1.
