Introduction \n \nA transformer may functio n well externally with \nmonitors, while some incipient deterioration may occur \ninternally to cause fatal problems in later development. \nNearly 80 % of faults result from incipient deteriorations. \nTherefore, faults should be identified and avoided at the \nearliest possible stage by some predictive maintenance \ntechnique. Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) is a reliable \ntechnique for detection of incipient faults in oil filled \npower transformer. It is similar to a blood test or a scanner \nexamination of the human body; it can warn about an \nimpending problem, give an early diagnosis and increase \nthe chances of finding the ap propriate cure. The working \nprinciple [1-3] is based on th e dielectric breakdown of the \nsome of the oil molecules or cellulose molecules of the \ninsulation due to incipient faults. When there is any kind of \nfault, such as overheating or discharge inside the \ntransformer, it will produce co rresponding characteristic \namount of gases in the transformer oil. These gases are \ndetected at the per part million (ppm) level by Gas \nChromatography [4-6]. It is a technique of separation, \nidentification and quantification of mixtures of gases. The \ncommonly collected and analyzed gases are Hydrogen (H\n2), \nMethane (CH4), Acetylene (C2H2), Ethylene (C2H4), Ethane \n(C2H6), Carbon Monoxide (CO) and Carbon Dioxide (CO2). \nThrough the analysis of the concentrations of dissolved \ngases, their gassing rates and the ratios of certain gases, the \nDGA methods can determine the fault type of the \ntransformer. Even under norm al transformer operational \nconditions, some of these gases may be formed inside. \nTherefore, it is necessary to  build concentration norms \nfrom a sufficiently large sampling to assess the statistics.  \n \n \n2. DGA Methods \n \nIf an incipient fault is pr esent in the transformer, \nconcentration of gases dissolved in the oil significantly \nincreases. A given gas volume may be generated over a \nlong time period by a relatively insignificant fault or in a \nvery short time period by a more severe fault. Once a \nsuspicious gas presence is detected, it is important to be \ncertain whether the fault that generated the gas is active by \ncalculating the total dissolved combustible gases (TDCG) \nand rate of TDCG [7] which is given by Eq. (1) as follows: \n \n \nT\nVSSR T\n6\n0 10.).( −−=  (1) \n \nWhere, R is rate (litres/day) \nSo  is the TDCG of First sample in ppm \nST  is the TDCG of Second sample in ppm \nV is tank oil volume in litres \nT is the time (days).  \n \nThe rate of generation of TDCG greater than 2.8 liters / \nday indicates that the transf ormer has an active internal \nfault and requires additional inspection by DGA methods.  \nIncipient faults can be reliably identified by visual \ninspection [8] of the equipment after the fault has occurred \nin service: \n(a) Partial Discharge (PD) - corona, possible X wax \nformation on paper insulation, sparking, inducing \npinholes, small carbonized punctures in paper.  \n(b) Discharges of low energy (D1) - larger punctures in \n† Corresponding Author: Dept. of Electrical Engineering, St. Vincent \nPallotti College of Engineerin g & Technology, Nagpur, India. \n(nitindhote@yahoo. com) \n* ITM College of Engineering, Nagpur, India.

The method gives \nfault after comparing these ratios to the limiting values.  \nIEEE / Modified Rogers method [7] utilizes three ratios \nR1, R2 and R3. Table 1 gives the values for three key gas \nratios corresponding to suggested diagnosis.  \nIEC Standard 599 [9] also utilizes three ratios R1, R2 \nand R3. The coding rule and classification of faults by the \nIEC method are given in Tables 2 and 3.  \nIn new IEC 60599 publication [10], major gas ratios \nhave been retained and three  additional gas ratios have \nbeen introduced for specific diagnosis. These three ratios \nare \n \nR 6 = C\n2H2 / H2  \nR 7 = O2 / N2 \nR 8 = CO2 /CO  \n \nIf R6 > 3, it gives the possible contamination from the \non load tap changer compartment. If R7 < 0.3, it gives \nabnormal oil heating or oxidation. If R8 < 3, it gives the \npossible paper involvement in the fault.  \nThe Duval Triangle [11] method utilizes three % ratios \nof certain gases for DGA interpretation of transformers \nfilled with mineral oil. The triangular coordinates \ncorresponding to DGA results in ppm can be calculated by \nEqs. (2-4) as follows: \n \n \n)(\n.100% 22 zyx\nxHC ++=   (2) \n )(\n.100% 42 zyx\nyHC ++=   (3) \n )(\n.100% 4 zyx\nzCH ++=  (4) \n \nWhere x, y and z are concentration of C 2H2, C2 H4 and C \nH4 in ppm resp. In addition to these three % ratios, Xiaohui \nLi et al., [12] utilizes fourth % ratio which is given by Eq. \n(5) as follows: \n \n )(\n.100%\n2622\n2\n2 COCOHCH\nHH +++=  (5) \n \nAll these techniques are computationally straightforward. \nHowever, these methods in some cases provide erroneous \ndiagnoses as well as no conclusion for the fault type.  \nTo overcome these limitati ons, Fuzzy Inference System \n(FIS) is proposed.  \n \n \n3. Flow Chart of Proposed System \n \nFlow chart of proposed system diagnosis is shown in Fig. \n1. The input data include concentration of dissolved gases \nC\n2H2, C 2H4, C 2H6, CH 4, H 2, CO and CO 2 of the sample. \nInformation such as tank oil volume, date of sampling and \ndate of installation of tran sformer is asked for further \ninference.  \nIn the first step, the system calculates TDCG and \ncompares with the standard permissible limits [7]. For \nnormal level of TDCG (< 720ppm), permissible limits for \nindividual gases are checked.

Dhote and J. B. Helonde \n 617 \nindividual gases indicates the satisfactory operation of a \ntransformer. Once an abnormal level of TDCG or \nindividual gas has been detected, the next step is to \ndetermine the rate of generation of TDCG (1) by analysis \nof the successive sample. For the normal rate of TDCG \n(less than 2.8 liters/day), further diagnosis is bypassed. For \nan abnormal rate of TDCG, the proposed FIS is adopted to \ndiagnose the probable faults. In the last step, severity \ndegrees are assigned to the diagnosed faults. On the basis \nof severity of faults, approp riate maintenance actions are \nsuggested.  \n \n \n4. Fuzzy Inference System \n \nIntelligent algorithms, e.g., Expert System [13], FIS [14], \nArtificial Neural Networks [15], Probabilistic Neural \nNetworks [16], Evolving Neural Networks [17] and \nArtificial Neural FIS [18-19] have been used to interpret \nDGA results. These algorithms are not entirely satisfactory. \nThese methods are mostly suitable for transformers with \nsingle fault. In case of multiple faults, only dominant fault \nis indicated by these methods. These methods based on \nspecific set of codes defined for certain gas ratios. Further, \nno quantitative indication for severity of fault and \nmaintenance suggestions is given by these methods.  \nThe proposed Fuzzy diagnostic method is prepared using \nthe MATLAB Fuzzy Logic Toolbox [20]. Sugeno type FIS \n[21-22] is used as a fuzzy inference method.  \nA typical rule in the zero order Sugeno fuzzy model has \nthe form;  \nIf input1 = x and input2= y, then output z = constant.  \nThe output level z\n of each rule is weighted by firing \nstrength w of the rule. For an AND rule, firing strength is \ngiven as  \n \nw = AND method [F1(x), F2(y)],  \n \nWhere, F1(x) and F2(y) are the membership functions \nfor input1 and input 2. The final output of the system is \nweighted average of all the rule output which is given by \nEq. (6) as follows: \n \n \n1\n1\n(. )\nn\nii\ni\nn\ni\ni\nwz\nw\nz =\n=\n∑\n∑\n=  (6) \n \nwhere, Z is final output and n is the number of rules.  \nThe FIS consists of 3 ratios R1, R2 and R3 as inputs. \nOne of the major drawbacks of IEC method is that when \ngas ratio changes across coding boundary, the code \nchanges sharply between 0, 1 and 2. In fact the gas ratio \nboundary should be fuzzy. Depending on the relative \nvalues of ratios in IEEE and IEC method, three fuzzy codes \nLow, Medium (Med) and High are selected. Due to \nuncertainty in measurements of gas concentrations by gas \nanalyzers, the gas ratios would have a relative uncertainty \nof plus or minus 10% [23]. Hence, 10% of the boundary \nvalue of each ratio (Table 1) overlaps between two \nconsecutive codes.  \nMembership function for code Low of ratio R1 is given \nby the linear declining function \n \n \n⎪⎪\n⎭\n⎪⎪\n⎬\n⎫\n⎪⎪\n⎩\n⎪⎪\n⎨\n⎧\n≥\n≤≤−\n−\n≤→\n=\n11.010\n11.0109.0)09.011.0(\n)111.0(\n09.011\n)1(\nR\nRR\nR\nRLowμ  (7) \n \nMembership function for code Med of ratio R1 is given \nby trapezoidal function \n \n \n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎭\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎬\n⎫\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎩\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎨\n⎧\n≥\n≤≤\n≤≤\n≤≤→\n≤→\n−\n−\n−\n−\n=\n3.31\n3.317.2\n7.2111.0\n11.0109.0\n09.01\n0\n)7.23.3(\n)13.3(\n1\n)09.011.0(\n)09.01(\n0\n)1(\nR\nR\nR\nR\nR\nR\nR\nRMedμ  (8) \n \nMembership function for code High of ratio R1 is given \nby linear increasing function \n \n \n⎪\n⎪\n⎭\n⎪⎪\n⎬\n⎫\n⎪\n⎪\n⎩\n⎪⎪\n⎨\n⎧\n≥\n≤≤→\n≤→\n−\n−=\n3.31\n3.317.2\n7.21\n1\n)7.23.3(\n)7.21(\n0\n)1(\nR\nR\nR\nRRHighμ   (9) \n \nThe Membership function for ratio R1 is shown in Fig. 2.  \nThe codes of the ratios R2 and R3 are also fuzzified as \nNormal\nSmaller\nDGA\nSample\nGreater\nNormal ageing\n(1)\nAbnormal\nAbnormal\n      Normal\n1\n maintenance\nactions\nFIS\n   TDCG\nRate of\nTDCG\n  Individual\ngas conc.\n \nFig. 1.

Weight in the range of 0 to \n1 is assigned to each fault type on the basis of severity of \nthe fault. The five types of faults used in FIS are TL < 0.2 \n>, PD < 0.4 >, D1 < 0.6 >, TH < 0.8 > and D2 < 1.0 >.  \nThe major drawback of the IEEE and IEC method is that \na significant number of DGA results in- service fall outside \nthe existing rules and cannot be diagnosed. Only 6 \ninference rules are suggested by the IEEE (Table 1) and 11 \ninference rules are suggested by the IEC (Table 3) out of \nthe 27 (3x3x3) possible rules. To overcome this limitation, \nentire 27 rules are obtained as a result of extensive \nconsultations with utility experts, existing literature, and \napproximately 1500 DGA case histories. Each rule consists \nof two components which are the antecedent (IF part) and \nthe consequent (THEN part). The rules having a similar \noutput are clubbed together and kept in order of increasing \nvalue of the weight of fault.  \nThe fuzzy rules are given below: \n \nRule 1: IF R1 =Low AND R2=Low AND R3=Med, \nTHEN Fault=TL.  \nRule 2: IF R1 =Low AND R2=Med AND R3=Low, \nTHEN Fault=TL.  \nRule 3: IF R1 =Low AND R2=Med AND R3=Med, \nTHEN Fault=TL.  \n \nFIS derives output from judging all the fuzzy rules by \nfinding the weighted average of all 27 fuzzy rules output.  \n \n \n5. Case Studies, Results and Discussions \n \nFIS is developed based on the proposed interpretative \nrules and diagnostic procedure of an overall system. To \ndemonstrate the feasibility of the system in diagnostic, 250 \nDGA gas records supplied by the major power companies \nin India have been tested.  \nAccuracy is calculated in two different ways,  \na)  When considering only number of predictions, \npercentage accuracy is given by Eq. (10) as follows:  \n \n  \nP\nR\nP T\nTA .100=   (10) \n \nWhere TR is the number of correct predictions and TP \nis the total number of the predictions,  \nb) When considering the total number of cases, \npercentage accuracy is given in Eq.

TDCG is above normal (> \n720 ppm). \nStep 2: The transformer is sampled again on 25/06/2011 \nto determine rate of TDCG . Concentrations of \ndissolved gases in ppm are as follows:  \nC\n2H2-418; C 2H4-235; CH 4-78; H 2-306; C 2H6-76; \nCO-1317; CO2-7458. \nTDCG in ppm = 2430; Rate of TDCG =17.02 lit/ \nday, which is greater than normal level (2.8lit/ \nday).  \nStep 3: FIS is applied for fault diagnosis. The output of \nFIS is given by rule viewer which is shown in \nFig. 5. Rule viewer shows R1=1.78(Med), R2= \n0.26 (Med) and R3=3.09 which lies on the \nboundary of the fuzzy ratios Med and High. Dark \ndots of the fault column show that rules 13 and 23 \nare satisfied which indicate possible faults D1 and \nD2 resp. This result matches with the actual fault \nof the transformer. Weighted average of both the \nrules is given as 0.86. Weight of both the faults can \nbe calculated as follows: \nWeight of D1 = (1 - 0.86) / (1 - 0.6) = 0.35 \nWeight of D2 =1 - 0.35 = 0.65 \nThe weights point towards the strong possibility of \nfault D2 and the relatively less possibility of fault \nD1. \nStep 4 : DGA interpretation by other methods is given as \nfollows: \nDornerburg : Unidentifiable \nIEEE : D2 IEC : D2 \nDuval triangle : D2 Xiaohui Li et al. : D2 \nThe key feature of the proposed method is that it \ncan diagnose multiple faults unlike conventional \nDGA methods.  \nStep 5: Severity of faults is very high. Maintenance actions \nsuggested are as follows: \n1. Retest oil daily.  \n2. Consider removal from service.  \n \n5. 2 Case study- II \n \nA 25 MV A, 220KV /132KV transformer is in service for \n15 yrs. Tank oil volume is 20000 liters. This transformer \nhad an X - wax deposition. Traces of discharges were \nfound on paper of high voltage cable. DGA data obtained \nin ppm after the fault on 18/03/2009 is as follows: \nC\n2H2-15; C 2H4-19; CH 4-172; H 2-1903; C 2H6-14; \nCO-180; CO2-635.  \n \nStep 1: TDCG in ppm =2303. TDCG is above normal (> \n720 ppm).  \nStep 2: The transformer is sampled again on 21/03/2009 \nto determine rate of TDCG . Concentrations of \ndissolved gases in ppm are as follows:  \nC\n2H2-26 C 2H4-23; CH 4-221; H 2-2257; C 2H6-22; \nCO-220; CO2- 821. \nTDCG in ppm = 2769; Rate of TDCG = 3.10 lit / \nday, which is greater than normal level (2.8 lit / \nday).  \nStep 3: FIS is applied for fault diagnosis. The output of FIS \nis given by rule viewer which is shown in Fig. 4. \nRule viewer shows R1 = 1.13 (Med), R2 = 0.0979 \nwhich lies on the boundary of the fuzzy ratios Low \nand Med and R3=1. 05 which lies on the boundary \nof the fuzzy ratios Low and Med. Dark dots in the \nfault column show that the rules 9, 10, 11 and 13 \nare satisfied which indicate possible faults PD and \nD1. This result matches with the actual fault of the \ntransformer. Weighted average of both the rules is \ngiven as 0.529. Weight of both the faults can be \ncalculated as follows: \nWeight of PD = (0.6 - 0.529)/(0.6- 0.4) = 0.355 \nWeight of D1 = 1-0.355 = 0.645 \nThe weights point towards the strong possibility \nof fault D1 and the relatively less possibility of \nfault PD.  \nStep 4 : DGA interpretation by other methods is given as \nfollows: \nDornerburg: Normal \nIEEE: Unidentifiable   IEC : Unidentifiable \nDuval triangle: Mix of thermal and electrical fault \nXiaohui Li et al.: TL \nFault is unidentifiable by IEEE and IEC method. \nDornerburg method gives normal condition of the \ntransformer.
