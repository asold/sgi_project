INTRODUCTION  \nSynthetic power networks are emerging as a potential \nsolution for the lack of test cases for performance evaluation \nin power system research and development. Generally, access \nto real data in critical infrastructure like power networks is \nlimited due to confidentiality requirements. Utility companies \nand regulatory agencies don’t share such data and strictly limit \naccess to actual power systems data for public and researchers \ndue to their sensitivity. On the other hand, it is important that \nnew concepts and  algorithms developed by researchers be \nevaluated in relatively large and complex networks with the \nsame characteristics as actual grids so that they can be \nreproducible by peers. For example, authors in [1]–[3] have \ndeveloped a new storage management and energy management \nalgorithms which enable  a bidirectional power flow from \nmicrogrids to power networks that need  evaluation with \nrealistic grid topology. Since Synthetic power networks are \nentirely fictitious but with the same characteristics as realistic \nnetworks, they can be freely published to the public to facilitate \nadvancement of new technologies in power systems.  \n                                                           \n* This paper was prepared as a result of work sponsored by the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E), U.S. Department of Energy, under Award \nNumber DE-AR0000714. \n† Corresponding author. Email: zfwang@vcu.edu \nDevelopment of efficient synthetic power system models \nrequires that their size, complexity, and electrical and \ntopological characteristics match those of real  power grids. \nPower networks are complex infrastru ctures with various \ncomponents. In addition to topological characteristics of power \nnetworks, they include several components with different \nelectrical characteristics such as different types of \ntransformers, switched shunt reactive power compensation, \nremote tap changing bus voltage regulation, etc. Development \nof synthetic power networks with the same complexity that can \nsimulate the exact behavior of actual grids needs a \ncomprehensive study of different components from both \nelectrical and topological perspectives. Also, increasing leve l \nof renewable generation in power systems has introduced an \nunprecedented level of uncertainty into grids [4].In the \nliterature, many studies are dedicated for characterizing actual \npower networks mainly from topological perspectives such as \nring-structured power grid developed in [5] and tree structured \npower grid model to address the power system robustness [6], \n[7]. Small world approach described in [8] served as a  \nreference for the works of [9]–[11] to develop an approach for \ngenerating truly synthetic transmission line topologies. A \nrandom topology power network model, called  RT-\nnestedSmallWorld, is proposed in [10] based on \ncomprehensive studies on the electrical topology of some real \nworld power grids. The impacts of different  bus type \nassignments in synthetic power networks on grid vulnerability \nto cascading failures are investigated in [12].  \nIn [13] the authors presented a substation placement \nmethod and transmission lines assignment from real energy \nand population data based on methodology introduced in [14], \n[15]. The proposed methodology employs a clustering \ntechnique to ensure that synthetic substations meet realistic \nproportions of load and generation. However, the authors will \ncontinue to augment test cases by  adding additional \ncomplexities such as transmission network  electrical \nparameters assignment. In another study, the authors \nperformed a statistical analysis on transmission line capacity \nregarding both topology and electrical parameters. However, \nall these studies focus mainly on topology -related parameters \nof transmission lines an d ignore electrical parameters such as \nimpedance of transmission lines and transformers. \nReview of the literature on synthetic grid modeling reveals \nthat there is a need for statistical studies to characterize \nelectrical parameters of transmission network  to be used in \nsynthetic grid models. In this paper, we mainly focus on the \nstatistical analysis of transformers and transmission lines \nelectrical parameters such as per unit impedance, nominal \ncapacity and X/R ratio. The goal of this paper is to a) provide \na well-defined “rules” for transmission network parameters as \npotential validation metrics for existing synthetic grid models  \nand b) to provide guidelines on how to accurately configure \nthem in synthetic models.  A very large sample of actual \noperating tr ansformers and transmission lines from two real \nworld power  systems is used to extract the statistical \ncharacteristics of their parameters. \nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II \npresents the statistical analysis on transformers electric al \nparameters. Section III discusses the statistics of transmission \nlines parameters and finally some concluding remarks and \nfuture work direction will be presented in section IV. \nII. GRID TRANSFORMERS \nGenerally, in power systems branches are referred to \ntransmission lines or transformers between two buses in the \nnetwork. Also, in some cases shunts are considered in the \nbranch category. In this paper we first perform some statistical \nanalysis on transformers electrical parameters extracted from \ntwo real world p ower systems. Next, transmission lines from \nthe same networks will be studied to extract some statistics for \ntheir critical parameters. \nA. Per unit impedance using the system MVA base or \ntransformer’s power rating? \nIn power system analysis the use of per unit  system to \nexpress the system quantities as fractions of a defined base unit \nquantity is common. This is important especially for \ntransformers as the voltage level is different for their terminals \nand per  unit system simplifies transformer calculations. \nAnother advantage for this expression is that similar types of \napparatus like transformers will have the impedances lying \nwithin a narrow numerical range when expressed as a per -unit \nfraction of the equipment rating, even if the unit size varies \nwidely. Howe ver, per unit impedances of power grid \ncomponents are usually converted to new values using a \ncommon system -wide base for application in power system \nanalysis like power flow or economic power flow calculations. \nThis conversion depends on reference voltage base for different \nzones in the system and a predefined unique power base for the \nentire system according to the following simple equation: \n𝑍𝑃𝑈\n𝑁𝑒𝑤 = 𝑍𝑃𝑈\n𝐺𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑛 ×(𝑉𝐵𝑎𝑠𝑒\n𝐺𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑛\n𝑉𝐵𝑎𝑠𝑒\n𝑁𝑒𝑤 )\n2\n×(𝑆𝐵𝑎𝑠𝑒\n𝑁𝑒𝑤\n𝑆𝐵𝑎𝑠𝑒\n𝐺𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑛)  \nwhere 𝑍𝑃𝑈\n𝐺𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑛, 𝑉𝐵𝑎𝑠𝑒\n𝐺𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑛, 𝑆𝐵𝑎𝑠𝑒\n𝑁𝑒𝑤 are given per unit impedance, \nvoltage base, and power base for each apparatus and 𝑍𝑃𝑈\n𝑁𝑒𝑤 is \nthe new per unit impedance calculated using 𝑉𝐵𝑎𝑠𝑒\n𝑁𝑒𝑤 and 𝑆𝐵𝑎𝑠𝑒\n𝑁𝑒𝑤. \nUsually, the voltage base values are selected the same as the \nnominal voltage of transformer terminals for each zone to \nsimplify the calculations. Therefore, the conversion formula for \nper unit impedance can be expressed as \n𝑍𝑃𝑈\n𝑁𝑒𝑤 = 𝑍𝑃𝑈\n𝐺𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑛 ×(𝑆𝐵𝑎𝑠𝑒\n𝑁𝑒𝑤\n𝑆𝐵𝑎𝑠𝑒\n𝐺𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑛)  \nIn the power grids the use of different voltage levels is a \ncommon practice to decrease the power loss through \ntransmission lines. Thus there are transformers with different \nturn ratios to couple the areas with different voltage  levels. In \nthis study, the transformers are grouped into different categories \nbased on their high voltage terminals. This is because as the \nnominal voltage level increases the transformer size gets larger, \nso studying them in groups based on voltage level  seems \nreasonable for extracting validation metrics. The purpose of \nstatistical experiments in this study is to identify several \nvalidation metrics for transformers parameters including their \nimpedances to help validate synthetic power networks. This \nwould be even more helpful if the range for different parameters \ncan be specified for typical power system components. The first \nexperiment tries to find the relationship between MVA rating \nof transformers and their per unit impedances. These analyses \nare perfo rmed on both per unit values in system base, and \nconverted values to transformers own MVA ratings.  The \noriginal power system data used in this study offer transformer \nimpedance in per unit calculated based on the common base for \nthe system. Fig. 1 shows the scatter plot of transformers per unit \nreactance (X) and MVA rating for the original and converted \nper unit reactance of transformers . Note that although \ntransformers with high voltage terminal of 115 kV are selected \nfor this comparison, the results are fairly consistent for other \nvoltage levels as shown in fig. 2. \n \n(a) \n \n(b) \nFigure 1.  Scatter plot of per unit reactance versus MVA rating of \ntransformer for a) system common base and b) converted to transformer own \nMVA rating. \nThe scatter plot for per unit reactance on system common \nbase shows a descending trend as the size of transformer \n\nincreases which means there is relatively large correlation \ncoefficient between the two as shown in fig. 1 (a). In this case, \nthe per unit rea ctance values span from nearly 0 to 2.75 p.u \nwhich is relatively large range for this parameter. However, \nwhen we consider the same scatter plot for converted per unit \nreactance to transformer own MVA rating, this range narrows \ndown to [0, 0.5] p.u putting at least 80% of them within even a \nnarrower range of [0.05, 0.2] p.u. In addition, almost zero  \ncorrelation coefficient means that this range is independent of \ntransformer size and voltage level. \nThe same scatter plots for converted values of per unit \nreactance versus MVA rating of transformers for other voltage \nlevels are depicted in fig.2. It is found that per unit reactance of \ntransformers in power systems regardless of their size lie within \na narrow range when calculated on their own power base  and \nstatistics reflect what is known from engineering practice. This \ncan be a potential validation metric for synthetic power \nnetworks transformers along with other statistical measures \nsuch as their probability distribution.  \n \n138 kV \n \n230 kV \nFigure 2.  Scatter plot of per unit reactance versus MVA rating of \ntransformer for 138 and 230 kV transformers. \nB. Transformer parameter distribution  \nTransformer parameters statistics are derived using over \n30000 actual power transformers. The database includes \ndifferent types of transformers such as fixed step down and step \nup transformers, three winding transformers, On -load Tap \nChanger (OLTC) transformers, and autotransformers.  A \nnegative impedance often occurs in the star modeling of a three \nwinding transformer due to how the l eakage reactance is \nmeasured/modeled [16]. Also, Network equivalencing methods \ncan create negative impedances which can affect the statistics \nof transmission network parameters. To avoid such scenario, \ndata are filtered by 𝑅 > 0,𝑋 > 0 to exclude abnormal \ntransformer parameters from samples. Also, due to lack of \ndetailed information on some transformers, their MVA ratings \nare reported with either very large or zero values. These \ntransformers too are excluded from samples to have accurate \nstatistics. \nThe proba bility distribution of transformer parameters is \nanother measure that can be used along with parameter range as \nvalidation metric in synthetic power networks. The probability \ndistribution of a random variable, say transformer per unit \nreactance, is a function that describes how likely we can obtain \nthe different possible values of the random variables. Using the \ndatabase of real transformer data, we can get the empirical \ncumulative density function (CDF) of each parameter that can \ngive us the empirical probability density function (PDF). Next, \nto provide a more systematic approach for generating synthetic \nmodels, we try to fit approximated distribution functions to \nempirical PDFs. The goodness of this fit can be measured with \nKullback-Leibler divergence. \n1) Kullback-Leibler Divergence \nIn probability theory and information theory, the Kullback–\nLeibler (KL) divergence, also called discrimination \ninformation, is a measure of the difference between two \nprobability distributions P and Q. It is not symmetric in P and \nQ. In applications, P typically represents the \"true\" distribution \nof data, observations, or a precisely calculated theoretical \ndistribution, while Q typically accounts for a theory, model, \ndescription, or approximation of P [17]. Specifically, the KL \ndivergence from Q to P, denoted 𝐷𝐾𝐿(𝑃 ∥ 𝑄), is the amount of \ninformation lost when Q is used to approximate P. For discrete \nprobability distributions P and Q, the KL divergence from Q to \nP is defined to be [18] \n𝐷𝐾𝐿(𝑃 ∥ 𝑄) = ∑𝑃(𝑖)𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑃(𝑖)\n𝑄(𝑖)\n𝑖\n  \nIn words, it is the expectation of the logarithmic difference \nbetween the probabilities P and Q, where the expectation is \ntaken using the probabilities P. Therefore, smaller values for the \ndivergence represents more accurate fit for the empirical PDF \nof transformer parameters. \n2) Transformer per unit reactance distribution \nThree different voltage levels, 115, 138, and 230 kV are \nselected to report in this study. Transformers are grouped based \non their high voltage terminal and categorized into three voltage \nlevels. For transformer per unit reactance, the converted per unit \nvalues to transformer power base  is used to identify the \ndistribution of per unit reactance. Fig. 3 shows the empirical \nPDF of transformer per unit reactance for different voltage \nlevels. As found earlier in this paper, converted values of pe r \nunit reactance lie within a narrow range. According to KL \ndivergence measure, it is found that the distribution of per unit \nreactance can be approximated with  t Location -Scale (TLS) \ndistribution with three parameters as shown in the following \ndistribution function: \n\n𝑓(𝑥|𝜇,𝜎,𝜈) =\n𝛤(𝜈 +1\n2 )\n𝜎√𝜈𝜋𝛤(𝜈\n2)\n[\n𝜈 +(𝑥 −𝜇\n𝜎 )\n2\n𝜈 ]\n−(𝜈+1\n2 )\n  \nwhere 𝛤 is the gamma function, 𝜇 is the location parameter, 𝜎 \nis the scale parameter, and 𝜈 is the shape parameter. The mean \nof the TLS distribution is 𝜇 and is only defined for 𝜈 > 1 and \nthe variance is 𝑣𝑎𝑟 = 𝜎2 𝜈\n𝜈−2 and is only defined for 𝜈 > 2. \nNote that if random variable 𝑥 has a TLS distribution with \nparameters 𝜇, 𝜎, and 𝜈, then \n𝑥−𝜇\n𝜎  has a Student’s t-distribution \nwith 𝜈 degrees of freedom. In probability and statistics, \nStudent's t -distribution (or simply the t -distribution) is any \nmember of a family of continuous probability distributions that \narises when estimating the mean of a normally distributed \npopulation in situations where the sample size is small. \n \n115 kV \n \n138 kV \n \n230 kV \nFigure 3.  Empirircal PDF and TLS-fit of per unit reactance for 115, 138, \nand 230 kV transformers. \nTable I shows the median, mean, minimum and maximum \nrange, and the percentage of per unit reactance lying within \n[0.05, 0.2] p.u range for the two real world power grids. \nTABLE I.

For the set of data from real world power grids, \nthere are transformers with different sizes from couple MVA \nto +1000 MVA. Also, due to the lack of detailed information \nin some cases, the MVA rating of some transformers are set to \na very large or small values. To exclude such cases, in addition \nto identifying the full range of transformer MVA rating, an \n80% range centered at the median is defined to get rid of \n“extreme values” on both upper and lower bound s. This will \ngive us a more useful range where most transformers fall in. \nTable II shows the median, mean, minimum and maximum \nrange, and 80% range for transformers MVA ratings. \nTABLE II.   MVA RATING STATISTICS FOR 115, 138, AND 230 KV \nTRANSFORMERS \n Transformer MVA rating \nVoltage Levels \n(kV) Median Mean Range 80% range \n115 53 71.30 [3, 384] [22, 140] \n138 83 117.24 [3.3, 616] [39, 239] \n230 203 246.61 [10, 1380] [62.5, 470] \nFig. 4 depicts the empirical PDF of transformers MVA \nrating and the approximated fit  distribution for 115 kV \ntransformers. Not e that the results for 138 kV and 230 kV \ntransformers will be presented later in a table. According to the \nKL divergence, transformers capacity is approximated with \nGeneralized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution with the \nminimum 𝐷𝐾𝐿 value where its CDF is represented by (5) \n𝐹(𝑥|𝜁,𝜇,𝜎) = 𝑒𝑥𝑝(−(1+𝜁(𝑥 −𝜇)\n𝜎 )\n−1\n𝜁\n)  \nwhere 𝜇 is location parameter, 𝜎 is scale parameter, and 𝜁 ≠ 0 \nis shape parameter. Using this mathematical distribution, one \ncan generate reasonable values for transformer capacities in a \ngiven synthetic grid model. \n4) Transformer X/R distribution \nThe third important parameter of transformers is the ratio of \ntheir per unit reactance to per unit resistance. Using such ratio, \none can estimate the value of per unit resistance given the range \nand distribution of per unit reactance of the transformer. These \ntwo parameters form the real and imaginary parts of \ntransformer impedance that is necessary for power flow \nanalysis in synthetic power networks. \nTable III shows the median, mean, minimum and maximum \nrange, and 80% range for transformers MVA ratings. The 80% \n\nrange is determined using the same approach as used in MVA \nrating determination.  \n \nFigure 4.  Empirircal PDF and GEV-fit of MVA rating for 115 kV \ntransformers. \nTABLE III.

Again, it is found that the GEV \ndistribution can fit the data best according to KL divergence \nmeasure.  Some very small X/R ratios come from \nautotransformers, and the ballpark is that if the ratio is less than \n4 to 1, it is an autotransformer. \n \nFigure 5.  Empirircal PDF and GEV-fit of X/R ratio for 115 kV \ntransformers. \nTable IV presents the estimated parameters of the best \nfitting functions for transformer MVA rating and X/R ratio. \nIII. TRANSMISSION LINES \nTransmission line  parameters statistics are derived using  \nover 50000 lines from real power systems. Transmission lines \nare categorized based on their nominal voltage level which \nranges from 0.6 to 765 kV. Here we study lines with nominal \nvoltage levels of 115, 138, and 230 kV. We studied per unit \nreactance, X/R ratio, and line capacities as three critical \nparameters of transmission lines to provide several validation \nmetrics and guidelines for synthetic grid modeling. \nA. Transmission line  per unit reactance distribution \nFig. 6 shows the empirical PDF of transmission line per \nunit reactance and the approximated fit  distribution for \ndifferent voltage levels. \nTABLE IV.

Empirircal PDF and Exponential-fit of per unit reactance for 115, \n138, and 230 kV transmission lines. \n\nIt is found that for all three voltage levels, per unit \nreactance is mostly less than 0.02 p.u. and the density drops \nexponentially as reactance increases. According to the KL \ndivergence, transmission line reactance  is approximated with \nExponential distribution with the minimum 𝐷𝐾𝐿 value where \nits PDF is represented by (6) \n𝑓(𝑥|𝜇) = 1\n𝜇𝑒\n−𝑥\n𝜇   \nUsing this mathematical distribution, one can generate \nreasonable values for transmission line per unit reactance  in a \ngiven synthetic grid model.  Note that, the distribution of per \nunit reactance for transmission lines is very different from TLS \ndistribution for those of transformers. This is bacuse of per unit \nconversion for transforemrs and implies that in order to have \nmore stablized range for t ransmission lines reactance,  it is \nbetter to study their actual distributed reactance (Ω/km). This \nwill be presented in our next comprehensive study. \nB. Transmission line capacity distribution \nTransmission line capacity is a critical parameter in various \nanalysis such as optimal power f low (OPF)  analysis, \ncontingency analysis, and power grid expansion planning. \nTherefore, here we studied the distribution of line capacity for \ndifferent voltage levels to identify a useful guideline and range \nfor actual capaciti es in the real grids. Fig. 7 shows the \nempirical PDF of transmission line  capacity and the \napproximated normal distribution with best estimated \nparameters based on 𝐷𝐾𝐿 for three different voltage levels . \nNote that, unlike transformers the distribution of MVA rating \nfor transmission lines is approximated with normal distribution \nwith higher mean values for each voltage level.  \n \n115 kV \n \n138 kV \n \n230 kV \nFigure 7.   Empirircal PDF and Normal-fit of line capacity for 115, 138, and \n230 kV transmission lines. \nC. Transmission line X/R ratio distribution \nThe third important parameter of transmission lines is the \nreactance to resistance ratio. Using such ratio, one can estimate \nthe value of per unit resistance given the range and distribution \nof per unit reactance of the line. These two parameters form \nthe real and imaginary parts of transformer impedance that is \nnecessary for power flow analysis in synthetic power \nnetworks. Fig. 8 shows the empirical PDF of transmission line \nX/R ratio and the approximated distribution with best \nestimated parameters based on 𝐷𝐾𝐿 measure for three different \nvoltage levels. It is found that normal distribution is the best fit \nfor this parameter based on the empirical PDF derived from \nactual data from two power grids. As shown in Fig. 8, the X/R \nratio of transmission lines for each voltage level is smaller than \nthat of transformers. Also, note that for both  transformers and \ntransmission lines, this ratio grows as the voltage level \nincreases.  \n \n115 kV \n \n138 kV \n\n \n230 kV \nFigure 8.   Empirircal PDF and Normal-fit of line X/R ratio for 115, 138, \nand 230 kV transmission lines. \nIV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS \nStatistical analysis on transformers and transmission lines \nelectrical parameters such as per unit reactance, MVA rating, \nand X/R ratio is per formed in this study to provide both \nvalidation metrics and guidelines for generating synthetic grid \nmodels. A large sample of  real data on transformers and \ntransmission lines from two real-world power systems is used \nto obtain statistics for the electrical  parameters. First, a \ncomparison made between per unit reactance calculated using \nsystem common base and values calculated us ing transformer \npower base  to decide which metric provides more stabilized \nrange for per unit reactance  of transformers. It is found that \nusing per unit reactance calculated based on transformer own \nMVA rating will give us a consistently stabilized range for per \nunit X over different voltage levels. Next, using Kullback -\nLeibler divergence, we tried to fit approximate distribution \nfunctions on empirical PDF s for electrical parameters of \nbranches. It is found that transmission lines exhibit different \nstatistical properties than transformers. The distribution of X/R \nratio for transmission lines is approximated with normal \ndistribution as opposed to the GEV distribution of this \nparameter for transformers. Also, this ratio is larger for \ntransformers compared to t ransmission lines. It is also found \nthat transformers/transmission lines of the higher voltage levels \ntend to have higher power ratings and X/R ratios. Our analyses \nprovide a list of well -defined rules for validation purpose in \nsynthetic grid models. In addition, obtained fit distributions can \nbe used to configure electrical parameters of transmission \nnetwork in synthetic grid modeling. For future work, a  \ncomprehensive study will cover more voltage levels in statistics \nderivations. We will also study the interdependence of different \nelectrical parameters of transmission network on voltage level. \nREFERENCES \n[1] M. H. Athari and M. M.
