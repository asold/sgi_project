    "abstract": "This paper gives an overview of the process of designing partial core transformers using a reverse&#13;\\nmodelling technique. Modifications are made to full-core equivalent circuit components to&#13;\\naccommodate partial core transformers. The model is applied to 50Hz transformers under normal&#13;\\noperating temperature applications and also to transformers immersed in liquid nitrogen. It is then&#13;\\nused for harmonic frequency analysis of partial core transformers where capacitive components&#13;\\nare included. In all cases, comparisons are made between the model calculations and test results of&#13;\\nas-built devices.",
