    "abstract": "Systems now exist which are able to con:pile unification gralmnars into language models that can be included in a speech recognizer, but it is so far unclear whether non-trivial linguistically principled gralnlnars can be used for this purpose.We describe a series of experiments which investigate the question empirica.lly,by incrementally constructing a grammar and discovering what prot)lems emerge when successively larger versions are compiled into finite state graph representations and used as language models for a medium-vocabulary recognition task.",
