For example, voltage-based\ndroop control can be implemented for the active power control\nof the generators and the control of the active loads. One of the\nmain advantages of a microgrid is that it can be implemented as\na controllable entity within the electrical network. This requires\nthe ability of the utility grid to control or inﬂuence the power\nexchange with the microgrid by communicating with only one\nunit. However, little research has been conducted on controlling\nthe power transfer through the point of common coupling. This\npaper addresses this issue by introducing the concept of a smart\ntransformer (ST) at the point of common coupling. This unit\ncontrols the active power exchange between a microgrid and the\nutility grid dependent on the state of both networks and other\ninformation communicated to the ST. To control the active power,\nthe ST uses its taps that change the microgrid-side voltage at the\nPCC. This voltage-based control of the ST is compatible with the\nvoltage-based droop control of the units in the microgrid that is\nused in this paper.

The shift towards near-\nload generation can make the grid more reliable and increase\nthe efﬁciency, if the network: 1) is properly coordinated and\noperated, 2) effectively faces the challenges posed by the\nintegration of renewable energy sources. In this context, the\nmicrogrid concept has been developed [1]–[3], a schematic\noverview of which is given in Fig. 1.

Microgrid with (power-electronically interfaced) loads, storage and\nDG units in stand-alone or grid-connected mode\nperspective [4]–[7]. A key advantage from the grid point of\nview is that the whole microgrid appears to the power network\nas a single controllable unit [8]. From the customers point\nof view, the impact of the microgrid on the reliability of the\ndistribution network is relevant, certainly in the future, with\nmore unpredictable generation and higher consumption (peaks).\nAnother new concept besides the microgrid, is the smart grid\nthat drives the electrical grid to become smarter and more\nﬂexible in the future. Microgrids are likely to play a key role\nin the evolution of the smart grid [9], as microgrids are better\npositioned than the centralized electrical network to meet the\nneeds of the future and stimulate innovations. In this sense,\nthe smart grid can emerge as a system of integrated smart\nmicrogrids [10], leading to an increasing interest in intelligent\nmicrogrids [11]. The microgrid can be considered and exploited\nas the main building block of the smart grid [12]. Microgrids\nand smart grids are being tested and demonstrated in many\nprojects such as the E.U. Microgrid Projects, the U.S. Certs\nMicrogrid, BC Hydro in Canada, the NEDO microgrid projects\nin Japan and the European SmartGrids Technology Platform\n[2], [13]–[18].\nIn terms of active power control, the DG units can be cate-\ngorized in dispatchable and undispatchable units. The power\nof the dispatchable DG units can be changed by the power\ncontrol strategy, often by implementing a droop control method\n[19]–[26]. In contrast, the output power of undispatchable DG\nunits such as photovoltaic panels and wind turbines, is normally\ncontrolled based on an optimal operating condition of an energy\nsource [23].\nAs the interfaces between the DG units and the microgrid\nare often based on power-electronic converters [27], microgrid\ncontrol requires implementing a proper control strategy in these\nconverters [28]. In the grid-connected mode of the microgrid,\nthe DG units deliver power to both local loads and the utility\ngrid. The reference voltage is then taken from the grid voltage.\nIn the islanded mode on the other hand, the DG units determine\ntheir own voltage to share the total load demand. In this paper,\n2\na grid voltage/dc-link voltage droop controller is used. This\ncontroller is combined with active power/grid voltage droop\ncontrol. The latter controller has an operation dependent on the\ngrid voltage level in order to fully exploit the advantages of\nboth dispatchable and undispatchable units and to avoid voltage\nlimit violation [29].\nThe integration of large amounts of (renewable-based) DG units\nposes some challenges in the electrical network. The current\npractice is to decide for each DG unit whether or not to allow it\nin a speciﬁc place. However, this does not lead to an optimized\namount of DG. The microgrid concept promises to address this\nissue by enabling microgrids to become controllable entities\nwithin the electrical network [2], [8], [12]. Then, the power\nexchange between the microgrid and the utility network needs\nto be controlled. One solution for this is that the utility network\ncommunicates new set points to all (or speciﬁed) DG units and\nactive loads, e.g., by using the multi-agent strategy of [30].\nHowever, this does not comply with the droop control strategy\nthat avoids inter-unit communication to operate in a distributed\nmanner. A possibility is, thus, that the utility network only\nneeds to communicate to the point of common coupling (PCC),\nand the microgrid droop controllers automatically respond.\nLittle research has been conducted on the power transfer\nthrough the PCC, much research concerning microgrids deals\nwith either grid-connected or islanded operation or the tran-\nsition between both [31]–[35]. Therefore, in this paper, this\npower exchange is controlled by means of a tap-changing\ntransformer located at the PCC, called the smart transformer\n(ST). The main aspects of the ST are: 1) the ST controls the\nbidirectional power transfer between utility grid and microgrid,\n2) the ST is able to aggregate information to determine its\nset point of power exchange, 3) the ST enables to exploit the\nmicrogrid as a controllable entity, because the utility network\nonly needs to communicate to the ST instead of all microgrid\nelements.\nTo control the power exchange between the main grid and\nthe microgrid, the ST changes the microgrid-side voltage.\nTherefore, the voltage-based droop control of the generators\nand active loads is combined with a voltage-based control of\nthe ST. In this way, ﬁrstly, the microgrid can automatically,\nwithout need for communication, adapt to changes of the ST\npower, and vice versa. Secondly, the ST makes it possible to\nkeep the same control methods for the DG units and active\nloads in both islanded mode and grid-connected mode.\nIn this context, the usage of the ST can be implemented\nas a level between the primary control and the secondary\ncontrol. For the actual secondary control, one possibility is\nto use a central controller with low-bandwidth communication\nwith each DG unit to change their set points in order to\nminimize a potential function [12] or using a communication-\nbased hierarchical control [36].\nThe remainder of this paper is divided into ﬁve sections.\nFirst, an overview of the used voltage-based active power and\nactive load control strategies in an islanded microgrid is given.\nSecond, the concept of the ST is introduced. In the third\nparagraph, a proof of concept for the ST located at the PCC\nin a simple microgrid is shown, proving that the ST enables\ncontrol of the power exchange to the microgrid. Next, a ST\nis implemented in a microgrid. Finally, a microgrid with ST\nsubjected to dynamic changes is studied. The simulations show\na proper operation of the ST. They also illustrate that the ST\nenables to exploit the microgrid as a controllable entity that\nautomatically adjusts to changes of the ST voltage.\nIn order to introduce the concept of the smart transformer,\nﬁrst, the active power control strategy of the generators and\nactive loads in [29], [37] are summarized. Further in this paper,\nthe smart transformer (ST) will follow an analogous control\nstrategy to control the power exchange between microgrid and\nutility network. Because of this analogous control, the micro-\ngrid can adapt to changes of the ST without communication.\nA. Active power control of the generators\n1. Concept\nThe active power controller of the DG units deﬁnes the refer-\nence terminal voltage vg,ref(t) of their voltage-source inverter\n(VSI) interface, which is depicted in Fig. 2. Because of the\nmainly resistive nature of the low-voltage microgrid lines, a\nlinkage between active power P and rms voltage Vg, and, a\nlinkage between reactive power Q and phase angle differences\nare valid [38]. Therefore, P/Vg droops and Q/f droops [39]\nare used to determine vg,ref(t). In Fig. 3, a general overview\nis given of the controllers, the details are discussed further in\nthis paper.\nPdc/Idc L\nVSIDC-side\nP1\nvgCdc C\nVdc\nQ1\nig rest of the\nmicrogrid\nLC ﬁlter\nVSI\nFig. 2.

Outer power control loop and inner voltage control loop\nThe active power controller of the generators, namely the\nvoltage-based droop controller, is based on two control strate-\ngies [29], with their operation dependent on the microgrid\nrms voltage. In a voltage band around the nominal microgrid\nvoltage, which is called the constant-power band, only the\nVg/Vdc droop control strategy is active. If the dc-link voltage\nVdc of a DG unit increases, which indicates that the ac-side\npower P is less than the dc-side power Pdc, this unit will\nincrease its terminal grid voltage Vg according to:\nVg = Vg,nom + a(Vdc − Vdc,nom), (1)\n3\nwhere ’nom’ denotes nominal values. Even a slight change of\nVg leads to a change of the power delivered to the electrical\nnetwork. This effect is realised by a natural balancing due to\nthe loads (such as loads with demand response as in § I-C\nor resistive loads) and the microgrid lines. This ﬁrst controller\nkeeps the generated power constant.\nIf the microgrid voltage exceeds this constant-power band,\nalso a Pdc/Vg droop controller is turned on, which changes\nthe generated power Pdc as a function of Vg. This droop\ncontroller avoids violation of the grid voltage limits. The details\nof the controllers are depicted in Fig. 4. The Pdc/Vg droop\ncontroller only changes Pdc if the microgrid voltage exceeds the\nadjustment voltages Vg,up and Vg,low, which identify a voltage\nband that does not exceed the tolerated microgrid voltage band:\nPdc =\n\n\n\nPdc,nom − k(Vg − (Vg,nom + Vg,up))\nif Vg >Vg,nom + Vg,up\nPdc,nom\nif Vg,nom − Vg,low <Vg <Vg,nom + Vg,up\nPdc,nom − k(Vg − (Vg,nom − Vg,low))\nif Vg <Vg,nom − Vg,low\n(2)\nIn case these adjustment voltages are not exceeded, Pdc remains\nunchanged and only the Vg/Vdc droop control strategy is used.\nThis operating condition is called operation in the “constant-\npower band”, which has a width 2b= Vg,up + Vg,low.\nVg\nVdc\nVg,nom\nVdc,nom\nVg/Vdc-droop controller\nVdc\nPdc\nVg\nVg,nom\nVg,low Vg,up\nPdc,nom\nVg\nPdc/Vg-droop controller\nPdc\nf\nQ\nfnom\nQnom\nQ/f-droop controller\nQ\nf\nvoltage controller\nduty ratio\nVSI\nFig. 4. Combined operation of the droop controllers to determine the set value\nof the grid voltage vg\n2. Characteristics\nThe Vg/Vdc control algorithm is fully distributed and deals\nwith the speciﬁc properties of the microgrid, such as the\nlack of inertia and the resistive line characteristics. Also, the\nVg/Vdc droop control strategy is based on the (transient) storage\ncapabilities of the dc-link capacitors and on the property that\nchanges of Vdc indicate changes of the state of the microgrid\npower. The Vg/Vdc droop control strategy delays changing the\noutput power of the generators by slightly varying Vg.\nThe Pdc/Vg droop controller also avoids the usage of com-\nmunication and central controllers, and is based on the resis-\ntive nature of the microgrid lines as well. If the dc-sources\nare current-controlled instead of power-controlled, analogous\nIdc/Vg droop controllers are used instead of the Pdc/Vg droop\ncontrollers.\nPdc\nVg\nVg,nom\nVg Pdc\nPdc\nVg\nVg Pdc\na) dispatchable unit b) less controllable unit\nvoltage limits\nPdc,nom\nVg,nom\nPdc,nom\nconstant-power\nband\nFig. 5. Fully dispatchable versus fully undispatchable DG unit. Dispatchable\nunits have a small constant power band (2b = 0 %), fully undispatchable DG\nunits have a very wide constant-power band.\nThe adjustment voltages Vg,up and Vg,low depend on the\ncharacteristics of the power source. For example, a distinction\ncan be made between dispatchable and undispatchable power\nsources. For dispatchable (controllable, often non-renewable)\npower sources, a narrow constant-power band can be handled\n(cf. Fig. 5a). Therefore, small variations of Vg from Vg,nom\naddress the Pdc/Vg droop controller to change Pdc. This enables\nto fully exploit the power control characteristics of the power\nsource and the power source acts dynamically to limit the\nvoltage changes by changing its output power.\nFor undispatchable power sources (slightly or not controllable,\noften intermittent renewable or combined heat and power units\nwith heat as primary driver), Pdc is determined externally and\ntherefore, a wide constant-power band must be applied. In\nthe example of Fig. 5b, the constant-power band of the fully\nundispatchable DG unit is wider than the voltage limits. Thus,\nthe output power is determined by the primary energy source\n(Pnom, often with optimal power-point tracking), not by the\nstate of the microgrid. For slightly dispatchable DG units, the\nlimit Vg,up can be chosen smaller than the microgrid voltage\nlimit. For example, many renewable sources can deviate from\nmaximum power if necessary or heat-driven CHP units can\nchange to electric power-driven mode, e.g. through thermal\nstorage in a boiler. Because of the increasing share of renewable\nenergy sources, active dispatching of these units in small-scale\nmicrogrids will be required, e.g. to avoid over-voltage tripping.\nAn example to make the generated power of wind turbines\nor photovoltaic generators controllable is by including hybrid\npower systems, e.g., by combining the generators with energy\nstorage systems and power management strategies [40], [41].\nThe reference power in this power management strategy comes\nfrom the Pdc/Vg droop controller. The voltage-based droop con-\ntrol strategy makes active dispatching of the renewable energy\npossible, while still, the power changes of the renewables are\ndelayed compared to those of the other DG units.\nIn conclusion, with a proper combined usage of Vg/Vdc\nand Pdc/Vg droop controllers, a higher degree of renewables\nand a more efﬁcient usage of the renewable energy can be\nachieved. The reason is the usage of different adjustment\nvoltages according to the characteristics of the DG units.\nTherefore, the changes of Pdc in the slightly-controllable units\n4\nare delayed compared to the more dynamical DG units. The\ntolerance band of the microgrid voltage compared to its nominal\nvalue is effectively used, while still, violation of the voltage\nlimits is avoided. Furthermore, the Vg/Vdc droop and Pdc/Vg\ndroop control strategies deal with the speciﬁc properties of\nthe microgrid and are fully distributed. Also, this active power\ncontrol strategy of the generators allows to use the microgrid\nvoltage as a trigger for possible active load control as discussed\nin §I-C. It also allows to use a PCC tap-changing ST to change\nthe power exchange between a microgrid and the utility grid,\nwithout communication to the DG units in the microgrid. This\nis explained in §II.\nB. Reactive power control of the generators\nIn the islanded mode of the microgrid, the reactive power of\nthe DG units is shared by using reactive power/grid frequency\ndroop controllers:\nf = fnom + KQ(Q− Qnom) (3)\nwith f the VSI frequency that dynamically determines its phase\nangle, Q the reactive power at the VSI terminals. In this way,\nin the islanded mode, the frequency will be determined by the\ntotal reactive power and reactive power sharing can also operate\nwithout inter-unit communication.\nC. Demand dispatch in the islanded microgrid\nBy using the aforementioned active power control method\nfor the generators, the possibility of the microgrid rms voltage\nto vary within certain limits is effectively used. Therefore, the\nmicrogrid voltage can be applied to communicate very high or\nvery low levels of generated power in the islanded microgrid.\nThese voltage changes are mainly due to the renewable power\nin case of proper application of the adjustment voltage. Hence,\nthe rms microgrid voltage is also the trigger for the demand\ndispatch strategy in [37], which operates according to a relay\nfunction in Fig. 6. In case of high (renewable) production\nlevels, the grid voltage increases, triggering some active loads\nto shift their consumption Pload to high voltage times. For\nlow voltage times, an analogous approach is followed. This\ndemand dispatch is performed with the emphasis of increasing\nthe reliability of the microgrid by providing assistance in the\nbalancing, thus, it operates without communication. Therefore,\nif a remote communication signal for external demand control\nis lost, still, the presented demand dispatch, which is crucial\nin small islanded microgrids, can cooperate with the control\nof the generators to balance the power in the microgrid with a\nshort response time.\nThis active load control based on the local microgrid voltage\nleads to a better usage of the available (renewable) energy\nbecause the consumers optimize their consumption accord-\ning to the microgrid voltage level, which depends on the\ninstantaneous production. For example, when customers shift\ntheir consumption towards high-voltage times, they mainly use\nrenewable power because of the usage of generator-speciﬁc\nadjustment voltages. Secondly, a possible advantage is also the\nreduction of the line losses in the microgrid. E.g., if a renewable\npower source switches on, the closest loads will sense a higher\nVg\nVg,nomVg,dVg,o\nPload\nPnom\nVg,q Vg,r\nFig. 6. Relay function for active load control\nterminal voltage and therefore, shift their consumption in time.\nIn this way, averaged over a speciﬁed time period and assumed\nthat the total consumption for each load remains constant in this\nperiod, the consumption is temporarily shifted to zones with\nan instantaneous higher production, decreasing the overall line\nlosses. Both advantages lead to an increased reliability and a\nbetter exploitation of the islanded microgrids.\nD. Virtual output impedances\nIn this paper, current-controlled power sources are used in\na mainly resistive microgrid. A control loop known as virtual\noutput impedance loop has been proposed in literature to ﬁx\nthe output impedance of the inverter, to increase the stability of\nthe system and to share linear and nonlinear loads. Therefore,\nvirtual inductive, resistive and complex impedances zv can be\nused [42]–[44]. In this paper, a resistive output impedance rv\nis chosen as this provides more damping in the system [45]\nand complies with the power control strategies of the loads\nand generators, where the active power is changed based on\nthe grid voltage:\nvref = vdroop − rvig, (4)\nwith vref the reference voltage, vdroop the voltage obtained by\nthe droop controllers and ig the grid current.\nII. C ONTROL OF POWER TRANSFER THROUGH SMART\nTRANSFORMER\nBecause of the high share of intermittent power sources and\nthe small scale of the microgrid, inducing possibly high load\npeaks, new means of power ﬂexibility are required. The droop\ncontrol of the DG units, active loads and storage can provide\nthis. Another means to include ﬂexibility is the usage of a\nsmart transformer. The ST controls the active power exchange\nbetween a microgrid and the utility grid dependent on the\nstate of both networks and other information communicated\nto the ST. The voltage-based control of the ST is compatible\nwith the voltage-based droop control of the units in the micro-\ngrid. Hence, the microgrid units can automatically respond to\nchanges of ST set points and vice versa.\n1. Control strategy\nTo change the active power exchange ∆PPCC between micro-\ngrid and utility grid, generally, a secondary control approach\nis used that communicates changes of the set points of the DG\nunits ∆Pset,i, such that\n∆PPCC =\nN∑\ni=1\n∆Pset,i.

Smart transformer with the equivalent circuits of the resistive virtual\nlines and the generators\nOpposed to the general approach, in this paper, the power\ntransfer between a microgrid and the utility grid is actively\ncontrolled without the need for communication to all microgrid\nelements. Instead, only ∆PPCC is communicated to the trans-\nformer that is often located at the PCC.

Smart transformer in microgrid\nand the ST strategy is shown in Fig. 8. The ST is an on-load\ntap changer (OLTC) as depicted in Fig. 9, that can change its\nmicrogrid-side taps to change the terminal voltage VPCC. The\ncontrol algorithm of the ST is based on the following discrete\nPI controller to control PPCC to PPCC,ref, Fig. 10:\nVPCC,k = VPCC,k−1 + (ek − ek−1)K1 + ekK2 (6)\nwith ek = PPCC,ref,k − PPCC,k, VPCC,k the STs secondary\n6\n+\n- PI VPCC\n+\n- droop PDC\nVg\nPCC transformer:PPCC,ref\nPPCC\nDG: Vg,nom\nactive loads:\nVg\nVg,nom\n+\n- relay Pload\ncontroller input parametersoutput parameter\nFig. 10.

The parameters K1 and\nK2 are derived from the proportional gain KP and the integral\ngain Ki in a continuous PI controller by using:\nVPCC(t) = Kp\n(\ne(t) + 1\nTi\n∫ t\n0\ne(τ)dτ\n)\n(7)\nwhich is transfered to discrete form by using backward ﬁnite\ndifference:\ndVPCC(t)\ndt ≈ VPCC,k − VPCC,k−1\n∆t . (8)\nFrom this, it follows that K1 = Kp and K2 = KP ∆t/Ti. A\nhigher power transfer from utility grid to microgrid, PPCC, can\nbe achieved by increasing VPCC, while of course, a lower VPCC\nhas the opposite effect.\nA consequence of a higher VPCC, for example, is that the\noverall voltage in the microgrid will increase. Therefore, the\ndifference between the DG units terminal voltages and the\noverall microgrid voltage will decrease. The DG units will,\nin this transient effect, deliver less ac power to the microgrid.\nBecause initially, the dc-power remains the same, the dc-link\nvoltage will increase. This increase will be sensed by theVg/Vdc\ndroop controllers of the DG units, increasing their terminal\nvoltage Vg. The Pdc/Vg droop controllers in turn will decrease\nthe dc-power in response to the increased Vg. In this way,\nthe DG units automatically deliver less power when the power\nimport to the microgrid is increased by increasing VPCC with\nthe ST.\nSummarized, the power transfer PPCC is altered by com-\nmunicating Pref,PCC to the ST. This ST uses a tap changer\nto inﬂuence its microgrid-side voltage VPCC. This directly\ninﬂuences the active power in the microgrid because 1) it is\na low-voltage network with mainly resistive line parameters,\nleading to a linkage between P and V, 2) the active power\ncontrol of both the generators and the active loads is voltage-\nbased. Because the active power controllers of the DG units in\nthe microgrid are voltage-triggered, the DG units automatically\nadapt. Therefore, Pref,PCC only needs to be communicated\nto a single unit and the rest of the microgrid adapts without\ncommunication. In this way, the microgrid can be exploited\nas a controllable entity within the electrical network for the\nprimary control. One remark is that secondary control, com-\nmunicating to more microgrid elements, can also be used, e.g.,\nfor optimization of the microgrid and economical issues.\n2. Reference power exchange between microgrid and utility\nnetwork\nThe reference power exchange PPCC,ref can be altered de-\npending on 1) the status of the main grid, 2) the status of\nthe microgrid (in case voltage-based control strategies are\nimplemented, this state is visible in the microgrid voltage), 3)\ncommunication delivered by, e.g., a central controller (time-\ndependent price information, enabled by the smart grid con-\ncept). Overall, this information can be either communication-\nbased or voltage-based. In case of voltage-based information,\nthe microgrid-side voltage is used as the trigger to change\nPPCC,ref. The smart transformer is smart in the sense that this\nvoltage-based strategy can be implemented in a PPCC,ref/VPCC\ndroop controller that does not require communication and is\nanalogous to the Pdc/Vg droop control of the DG units. In\nthis way, the utility can (help) supply the balance of power\nin the microgrid by using the voltage-based method. In case\nof the communication-based information, in literature already\nsome methods that determine OLTC set points are discussed,\nsuch as [46], [47]. These methods use an optimized power ﬂow\nalgorithm and an active management scheme. Also, in case of\nmultiple microgrids, each microgrid can be seen as a single\nentity providing ancillary services, such as frequency regulation\n[48]. This frequency regulation can be coordinated between\nthe microgrids by means of communication resulting in new\npower set points for the ST. The ST aggregates all the available\ninformation, both voltage-based and communication-based, to\ndetermine a reference power transfer PPCC,ref between the\nmain grid and the microgrid. The determination of PPCC,ref\nis not the focus of this paper and the communication-based\nmethod is used for this.\n3. Discussion\nThis control algorithm has several advantages:\n1) By using a controlled tap-changing ST located at the PCC\nin the grid-connected mode, the microgrid operates in a\nvirtually islanded mode. This means that the microgrid\nelements can use the same control strategy both in grid-\nconnected and islanded mode.\n2) The control strategy of the smart transformer is compati-\nble with the control of the loads and generators, because\nthey are all voltage-based.\n3) For PPCC control, only communication between the\nutility grid and the smart transformer is required.\n4) The microgrid adapts automatically to changes in the\npower transfer PPCC. Therefore, the usage of a ST\nenables one of the main advantages of microgrids, namely\nthat the microgrid can be seen as a controllable entity\nfrom the utility grids point of view\nA disadvantage is that the reactive power control strategy\nin the microgrid must be changed when using the ST. In\nthe islanded mode with Q/f droop control, the frequency is\ndetermined by the total reactive power. In the grid-connected\nmode with ST on the other hand, the microgrid frequency\nfollows the grid frequency. As this can be assumed largely\nconstant and nominal, all units operate at nominal reactive\npower. Generally, this involves unity power factor operation.\nHowever, by using low-bandwidth communication, the reactive\npower of the DG units can be altered by changing the nominal\nQ or f set points, this can be included in a secondary control\nstrategy, which is out of scope of this paper.\n7\nAnother option would be the usage of a back-to-back (ac to\nac) converter [49]. This conﬁguration has an energy buffer in\na dc-link capacitor, thus, gives more control ﬂexibility. Also,\nopposed to a transformer, a back-to-back converter can control\nthe microgrid frequency. Therefore, the converter can alter the\nreactive power exchange between the microgrid and the main\ngrid even if the Q/f droop control of the DG units is kept\nin the grid-connected mode. A back-to-back converter further\nrenders dynamic decoupling to prevent voltage and frequency\nﬂuctuation in the utility side to impact the microgrid loads.\nThe tap-changing ST only renders dynamic decoupling for\nvoltage changes, not for frequency changes. Still, the frequency\nﬂuctuation in the utility network is rather small, while voltage\nﬂuctuations are more common, and would be severe because of\nthe active power/voltage linkage in the low-voltage microgrid.\nThe main disadvantage of a back-to-back converter is its\nhigh cost, because of the large rated power. This makes it\nimpracticable for the power exchange control discussed in this\npaper.\nIII. P ROOF OF CONCEPT\nFor a proof of concept, a basic microgrid is simulated,\nwith simulations upto the level of the converter switches. The\nsimulation parameters are summarized in Table I. The active\npower and voltage controllers start at t= 0 s with Vg = 230 V\nrms.\nThe microgrid consists of one ST located at the PCC, two\nDG units and two loads, as depicted in Fig. 11. Both DG units\napply the Vg/Vdc droop and Idc/Vg droop control strategies. The\nﬁrst DG unit, G1, has a wide constant-power band 2bof 16 %,\nrepresenting a slightly controllable DG unit, e.g., a renewable\nenergy source with small storage capabilities. In this paper, the\nchanges of, e.g., wind or sun, changing Idc are not taken into\naccount. The second one, G2, has a constant-power band 2bof\n0 %, thus, represents a highly dispatchable unit. The dynamic\neffects of the changes of Idc of this unit are not modelled in\ndetail, the simplest way to do so is by including a low-pass ﬁlter\nthat slows down the obtained changes of Idc. Here, the low-pass\nﬁlter is omitted. The nominal input dc-currents are 1.5 A and\n3 A for G1 and G2 respectively. Both loads are resistive loads.\nFurthermore, virtual output impedance behavior is included and\nthe line impedances are purely resistive. The latter is a valid\nassumption as generally, the low-voltage microgrid lines are\nmainly resistive, and this effect is increased by the resistive\nvirtual output impedance. In [29], some inductance is included\nin the lines and this still shows a stable operation.\nThree situations, depending on the reference active power\nthrough the ST, Pref, are investigated. Again, the method to\ndetermine PPCC,ref, e.g. based on an optimal power ﬂow\nalgorithm, is not considered.\n• PPCC,ref = 800 W in Fig. 12. This simulation shows that\nthe ST can track a reference active power by changing its\nmicrogrid-side voltage. Also, because of the voltage-based\ncontrol of the DG units and the ST, the microgrid auto-\nmatically responds to changes of the ST. The microgrid\nimports relatively much power from the main grid, for\nexample, because of low energy prices in the main grid\nor off-times for the intermittent DG units in the micro-\ngrid. The obtained steady-state results are summarized in\nG1:\nIdc/Vg-droop\nLimited control ability:b =8 %\nVg/Vdc-droop G2:\nIdc/Vg-droop\nFully controllable:b = 0 %\nVg/Vdc-droop\nRs Cf Idc,2\nIdc,1\nST\nR1\nR2\nRL1\nG2\nCdc\nG1\nCdc\nCf\nR3\nR4\nRL2\nLf\nLf\nutility\nnetwork\nFig. 11.

The input dc-current of G1 remains 1.5 A as its\nterminal voltage, namely 226.8 V remains in the constant-\npower band of [ (1 − b)Vg,nom,(1 + b)Vg,nom] or [211.6,\n248.4] V . The input dc-current of G2 is slightly increased\nto 3.26 A as this power source has a constant-power band\n2b of 0 % and its terminal voltage is slightly lower than\nthe nominal voltage.\n• PPCC,ref = 0 W in Fig. 13. The smart transformer controls\nits secondary rms voltage such that there is no active power\nexchange between the main grid and the virtually islanded\nmicrogrid. Still, the PCC switch is closed, so reactive\npower exchange between both networks is possible.\nAs depicted in Table II, the terminal voltage of the ST\nis lower to obtain a lower PPCC compared to the case\nof Fig. 12. This low ST voltage inﬂuences the voltages\nof the rest of the microgrid. Hence, a lower terminal\nvoltage Vg,2 is obtained, and therefore, the ﬂexible DG\nunit G2 increases the delivered dc-current. The inﬂexible\nunit G1 on the other hand, delivers nominal dc-current of\n1.5 A because the grid voltage remains in the constant-\npower band.

The same trend\nas in the previous case is concluded: more power is\ngenerated in the microgrid because of the power export\nto the main grid. Opposed to the previous cases, the\nterminal grid voltages of both power sources are under\nthe lower adjustment voltage, so both sources increase\ntheir dc-current. This shows the advantage of using the\nIdc/Vdc droop control with generator-dependent width of\nthe constant-power band: the change of the dc-current of\nthe inﬂexible DG unit G1 is delayed compared to that of\nthe more ﬂexible unit G2.\nIn the previous simulations, the voltage limits and usage\nof energy storage are not taken into account such that more\nextreme voltages compared to practical situations can be ob-\ntained, which is also due to the small scale of the simulated\nmicrogrid. In this way, the effect of the ST and changes of\n9\nthe DG units can be studied. To take these voltage limits into\naccount, the control signals of the ST can be inﬂuenced by\nthe voltage state of the microgrid and active load control and\nstorage can be included, which is not the case in the previous\nsimulation. Also, a microgrid with only two DG units, one of\nthem being inﬂexible was studied, so more ﬂexibility in the\nDG units would lead to voltages closer to the nominal value.\nIn conclusion, by implementing the smart tap-changing\ntransformer in the microgrid, the power exchange between a\nmicrogrid and the utility grid can be controlled by changing\nthe microgrid-side voltage of the ST. It is also shown that the\nmicrogrid generators automatically (without need for communi-\ncation) change their output powers according to the microgrid-\nside voltage of the ST. In this way, the ST can signiﬁcantly\ninﬂuence the microgrid state.\nIV. S MART TRANSFORMER DELIVERS INCREASED\nFLEXIBILITY TO THE MICROGRID\nIn this simulation example, a more realistic microgrid (four\ngenerators, different loads, smart transformer) is studied. The\nmain purpose of this simulation is 1) to study the ST operation\nin the microgrid, 2) to compare the cases of real islanded\nmicrogrid and a grid-connected microgrid. The microgrid con-\nﬁguration is depicted in Fig. 15. The microgrid sources have\nthe following characteristics:\n• G1\nConstant-current source with a nominal dc-current Idc,nom\nof 6 A. The active power control is performed by the\nVg/Vdc droop controller only, thus, a very large constant-\npower band is included. For example, G1 can represent a\nrenewable energy source.\n• G2\nG2 uses Vg/Vdc and Pdc/Vg droop control strategy and\nhas limited control ﬂexibility. Therefore, a constant-power\nband 2b = 10 % is included. The nominal power of this\npower-controlled source equals P2,nom = 3000 W.\n• G3\nCurrent-controlled source with Vg/Vdc and Idc/Vg droop\ncontrol and I3,nom = 5 A, constant-power band 2b =\n6 %. This constant-power band can be included in a semi-\ndispatchable unit, for example a CHP unit with heat as the\nprimary driver, but in case of extreme terminal voltages,\nelectric power can become the primary driver.\n• G4\nVg/Vdc and Idc/Vg droop control, fully ﬂexible current-\ncontrolled source as the constant-power band 2b equals\n0 % representing a fully dispatchable DG unit, I3,nom =\n3.5 A.\nHere, only linear loads are included as the focus is on the ST,\nnot on the active power controllers. An analogous microgrid\nwith nonlinear loads and inductive line elements has been\nconsidered in [29]. The system parameters are equal as in the\nprevious simulation, and are summarized in Table I.\nA. Case without smart transformer\nIn this simulation case, the switch at the PCC is open, thus,\nan islanded microgrid is obtained.\nG: DG units\nL: loads\nG3\nG2:\nL4\nL3\nG1\nL2\nL5\n0.29 Ω\nG1:\nNot dispatchable\nVg/Vdc-droop\nPdc/Vg-droop\nLimited control ability:b = 5 %\nVg/Vdc-droop\nG3:\nDynamically variable I-source:b = 3 %\nVg/Vdc-droop\nG4:\nIdc/Vg-droop\nHigh control ability:h = 0 %\nVg/Vdc-droop\nSST\nST: Smart\nTransformer\nG4\nIdc/Vg-droop\nG2\nL1\nU\nU: Utility network\n0.01 Ω\n0.01 Ω\n0.025 Ω 0.29 Ω\n0.3 Ω\n0.1 Ω\n0.5 Ω\n0.1 Ω\n0.05 Ω\n0.05 Ω\n0.15 Ω 0 .05 Ω\n0.05 Ω\nFig. 15. Microgrid conﬁguration successive comparison by including a smart\ntransformer and demand dispatch\nThe simulation results in Fig. 16 show a stable microgrid\noperation. From the simulations, it follows that, as G1 has no\ncontrol ﬂexibility, its dc-current remains the nominal value of\n6 A. G2 on the other hand, which has some control ﬂexibility,\nincreases its output power from nominal 3000 W to 3122 W as\nits terminal voltage is lower than the lower adjustment voltage\nof 0.95Vg,nom = 218.5 V . The same is valid for G3 and G4.\nNote that in this case, low generated powers are chosen to\nobtain low output voltages. In this way, the impact of more\ncontrol ﬂexibility, namely the ST can be studied in detail in\nthe next case. Still, a proper microgrid operation is obtained,\ndespite the small scale of the microgrid, the very low control\nﬂexibility in the generators and the ignored impact of energy\nstorage and active load control.\nB. Case with smart transformer\nIn this simulation case, the PCC switch is closed to operate\nthe microgrid in a grid-connected mode. Because of the low\nvoltages obtained in the previous case, the reference power\nimport in the microgrid, through the ST, equals 500 W (which\nis a chosen value dependent on the microgrid state only). Also,\nthe same communication-less control strategy of the DG units\nis used as in the previous case. The simulation results are shown\nin Table III and Fig. 17.\nCompared to the simulation case without ST, the terminal\nvoltages of all units are higher, thus closer to the nominal value,\nbecause of the power import through ST. The simulations also\nshow that slightly more power is delivered by some DG units.\nThe reason is that the ST increases the microgrid voltage and\nmost generators here use current-controlled energy sources. For\nexample, for the current-controlled source G1, because of the\nVg/Vdc-droop control, an increase of Vg leads to higher Vdc.\nAs the dc-link voltages increases, under constant Idc, also the\ndc-power increases. In this way, the delivered ac active power\nis slightly increased as well.

S MART TRANSFORMER IN A MICROGRID WITH\nDYNAMICAL CHANGES\nIn the following simulations, some dynamical events are\nincluded to study changing parameters in a microgrid that is\nconnected to the utility network through a smart transformer.\nThe microgrid conﬁguration of Fig. 18 is studied. The simula-\ntion results are shown in Table III and Fig. 17. This microgrid\nconsists of three power sources:\n• G1\nThis power source fully operates with a combination\nof Vg/Vdc droop control and Idc/Vg droop control. An\nexample of this is a power source that is ﬂexible in power\nchange.\n• G2\nThis power source applies the Vg/Vdc droop control\nstrategy if the microgrid voltage does not exceed the\nadjustment voltages of Vnom± 1%. Otherwise, the power\ncontrol strategy is extended with Idc/Vg droop control.\nAn example of this is a power source that has a limited\nﬂexibility (storage or fuel intake).\n• G3\nG3 operates at constant dc-current with a Vg/Vdc droop\ncontrol strategy. This can be a renewable energy source\nthat operates according to a maximum-power point track-\ning (MPPT) algorithm. Of course, the dc-current can\nchange because of external factors such as wind speed\nor solar irradiation, but not by the VSI control strategy\nitself. The only control ability possible in this power\nsource is turning off in case of too high terminal voltages\nor a faulted electrical network. In practical applications\nhowever, it is recommended to follow the MPPT as long as\npossible, but with possibility to leave the MPPT algorithm\n11\nS1 S2\nS1 to S6:\nS3\nG2 L1 L4\nS4\nG1\nL1 to L3:\nG1 to G3:\nS1: 1Ω; 1 mH\nS2: 0.1Ω\nS3: 0.1Ω\nS4: 0.5Ω\nL1: 15Ω\nL2: 25Ω // 0.05 H\nL3: 25Ω\nDG units (VSIs)\nline segments\nloads\nS5 S6\nL5 G3\nS5: 0.1Ω\nS6: 3Ω\nL2 L6\nG1 (VSI1):\nIdc/Vg-droop\nFully dispatchable:\nVg,up=Vg,low=Vg,nom\nG2 (VSI2):\nIdc/Vg-droop\nLimited control-ability\nVg,up= 1.01Vg,nom\nVg/Vdc-droop\nVg,low=0.99 Vg,nom\nG3 (VSI3):\nNot dispatchable\nVg/Vdc-droop\nL3\nL4: Rvar,1\nL5: 25Ω\nL6: Rvar,2\nSq\nSq: 0.5 mH\nSr\nSr: 1 mH\nST\nPCC\nSl\nST: Smart transformer\nSl: 2Ω\nFig. 18. Microgrid conﬁguration: extended example\nin case of extreme voltages. For example, in case the\nmicrogrid stability is jeopardized, the generator can also\ncontribute in the power balancing by abandoning the\nMPPT. This can be realized by including a wide constant-\npower band. In this simulation however, as the smart\ntransformer is studied, this VSI 3 does not contribute to\nthe power balancing.\nIn the following simulations, the nominal generated dc-currents\nare: Idc,1 = 7 A, Idc,2 = 4 .5 A and Idc,3 = 3 .5 A. For\nthe reactive power control, Q/f droop control is applied, with\nequal droops for the power sources. The loads considered here\nare a combination of variable and non-variable loads. The\nsimulations mimic a dynamic proﬁle, with dynamic events such\nas losing a generator and changing the demand dispatch. These\ndynamic events follow very quickly compared to an actual\nmicrogrid. The reason is to have shorter simulation times, as\nthe steady-state conditions give no further information. Starting\nfrom 230 V without demand dispatch (DD), the dynamic events\nincluded in the following simulation are:\n• t= 0 s: all VSIs operate at 100 % (nominal) power;\n• t= 0.35 s: VSI 3 switches off;\n• t= 0.36 s: start of the DD for both variable loads. Here\nbasic DD is included: Rvar,1 can change from 25 Ω to\n50 Ω with Vg,o = 0.91Vg,nom and Vg,d = 0.96Vg,nom in\nthe relay function of Fig. 6. The second load with DD\nRvar,2 can change from 25 Ω to 5000 Ω with Vg,o =\n0.93Vg,nom and Vg,d = 0 .97Vg,nom. The DD operates\nwith a delay, for stability reasons, to include measurement\nand responsive delay and for practical reasons in the\nimplementation in the loads.\n• t= 0.70 s: VSI 3 starts operating at 50 %;\n• t = 0.85 s: the DD turns off for the ﬁrst variable load,\nsuch that Rvar,1 = 25 Ω, as, e.g., its power consumption\ncan not be delayed any further.\n• t = 1 s: the nominal dc-current of VSI 2 falls down to\n75 %.\nIn the simulations presented below, ﬁrst, the islanded mi-\ncrogrid without smart transformer is studied. Secondly, this is\ncompared with the case of a microgrid with smart transformer.\nA. Case without smart transformer\nThe simulation results for the case without smart transformer\nand with open PCC switch are depicted in Fig. 19.\n• 0 < t <0.35 s: After a start-up transient, the terminal\nvoltages reach Vg,1 = 218 V ,Vg,2 = 216 V and Vg,3 =\n236 V .\n• 0.35 < t <0.7 s: The demand signal for both variable\nloads turns on. Despite the loss of VSI 3, the contribution\nof the DD leads to a small voltage increase to Vg,1 =\n218 V and Vg,2 = 217 V . For the same reason, the power\nsources deliver slightly less power to the microgrid. One\nremark according to the disconnection of G3 is that in the\ntime span where G3 is turned off, the terminal voltage\nof this VSI slowly decreases. This has no practical value\nfor the microgrid, as G3 is disconnected. The reason for\nthis voltage decrease is that the disconnection of G3 is\nmodelled with 1) Idc,3 = 0 A, 2) a switch located after\nthe LC ﬁlter of G3 opens. Therefore, the LC-ﬁlter is not\nsupplied and the ﬁlter capacitor voltage decreases across\nparasitic resistances, which are here simulated as a large\nresistance in parallel with this capacitor.\nTherefore, despite the loss of a DG unit, the active load\ncontrol enables a stable microgrid operation.\n• 0.7 <t< 0.85 s: Higher microgrid voltages are obtained\nbecause of the activation of VSI 3.\n• 0.85 <t< 1 s: At 0.85 s, the demand signal of Rvar,1 is\nturned off, leading to a higher load burden. Therefore, the\nmicrogrid voltages are slightly decreased and G1 and G2\nrespond by increasing their output power.\n• t <1 s: Because less power is delivered by G2, the mi-\ncrogrid voltages are lower compared to the previous time\nspan: with Vg,1 = 217 V ,Vg,2 = 213 V and Vg,3 = 220 V .\nFurthermore, because of the lower P2, P1 increases. In\nsteady-state also, Idc,1 = 9 .5 A, Idc,2 = 5 .2 A and\nIdc,3 = 1.8 A.\nIn general, by including the active load control depending on\nthe microgrid voltage, the load can actively contribute to the\nstabilization of the microgrid.\nB. Case with smart transformer\nIn this simulation, the feasibility of the smart transformer\nconcept in a microgrid with dynamic events is studied. The\nreference power of the smart transformer starts at 800 W.\nAt t = 0 .80 s, Pref decreases to -800 W. Generally, the\nstate of the microgrid inﬂuences Pref,PCC, e.g., by including\nPref,PCC,/VPCC droop control in the ST. However, in order to\n12\nt(s)\nVg(V)\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4\n160\n180\n200\n220\n240\n260\n280\n(a) Microgrid voltage\nt(s)\nP(W)\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4\n-1000\n0\n1000\n2000\n3000\n4000\n5000\n6000\n7000\n8000\n(b) Active power to the electrical network\nFig. 19. Dynamic proﬁle: without smart transformer (— = G1; ---- = G2;\n— = G3)\nstudy a more difﬁcult case, here, Pref,PCC is determined by\nexternal information only.\nThe simulation results for the case with smart transformer\nare depicted in Fig. 20. From the simulations, it follows that\nin the ﬁrst time span 0 <t< 0.35 s, the terminal voltages are\nVg,1 = 219 V ,Vg,2 = 221 V ,Vg,3 = 238 V and Vg,ST = 228 V .\nThe obtained voltages are higher than in the previous case,\nbecause of the power input from the utility grid.\nAt t = 0 .8 s, the reference power of the smart transformer\ndecreases signiﬁcantly, which can be triggered by the utility\nnetwork because of, e.g., a sudden loss of a generator. From the\nsimulations, it follows that the dispatchable DG units increase\ntheir output power, without communication, to compensate for\nthis change in the smart transformer. The voltage in the micro-\ngrid decreases, such that the microgrid will trigger the smart\ntransformer to change Pref,PCC by means of Pref,PCC/VPCC\ndroop control, in order to prevent under-voltage conditions.\nThis is not included in this example in order to study the\nreaction of the DG units on the Pref,PCC change rendered by\nthe utility network.\nIn steady-state, Vg,1 = 215 V ,Vg,2 = 209 V ,Vg,3 = 216 V and\nthe delivered dc-currents are: Idc,1 = 10.0 A, Idc,2 = 5.8 A and\nIdc,3 = 1.8 A. Idc,1 and Idc,2 are higher than in the previous\ncase to compensate for the power export to the main grid.\nIn conclusion, the simulations indicate that the smart trans-\nformer is able to operate in a microgrid with dynamic events.\nBy adapting its Pref,PCC to the microgrid state, a higher power\nquality (voltage quality) can be obtained. Furthermore, the\nmicrogrid generators and active loads automatically adjust to\nstate of the smart transformer.\nt(s)\nVg(V)\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4\n180\n190\n200\n210\n220\n230\n240\n250\n260\n270\n280\n(a) Microgrid voltage\nt(s)\nP(W)\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4\n-1000\n0\n1000\n2000\n3000\n4000\n5000\n6000\n7000\n(b) Active power to the electrical network\nFig. 20. Dynamic proﬁle: with smart transformer (— = G1; ---- = G2; —\n= G3, ---- = smart transformer )\nC. Nonlinear loads\nFor completeness, also the case with a nonlinear load and\ncomplex line parameters is included. The simulation results are\ndepicted in Fig. 21. The 25 Ω load L2 is, in this simulation,\nchanged to a rectiﬁer bridge feeding this load, thus, a nonlinear\nload. The inductive components of the line parameters have also\nchanged: S1 becomes 1 Ω in series with 5 mH, S3 is 0.1 Ω in\nseries with 5 mH and Sq has changed to 5 mH.\nFrom the simulation, it follows that despite the combination\nof: 1) the droop controllers with nonlinear loads and 2) the\nvoltage-based control strategies with complex line components,\na stable microgrid operation is obtained. The microgrid with\nsmart transformer shows good results despite the nonlinear\nloads and the complex line impedances.\nVI. C ONCLUSION\nIn conclusion, by implementing a smart transformer at the\nPCC, the power exchange between the microgrid and the utility\ngrid can be controlled by altering the microgrid-side voltage of\nthe smart transformer. In this paper, it is also shown that the\nmicrogrid elements can use the same control algorithm in the\ngrid-connected mode with smart transformer as in the islanded\nmode. The reason is that the control strategies of the DG units,\nactive loads and smart transformer are all voltage-based.\nFrom the simulations, it follows that the smart transformer\ngives more control ﬂexibility to the microgrid. To control the\npower exchange between microgrid and utility grid, the utility\ngrid only needs to communicate to the smart transformer,\ninstead of to all microgrid elements. The smart transformer\naggregates this information with the voltage information of the\nmicrogrid to determine its power exchange and all microgrid\n13\nt(s)\nVg(V)\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4\n180\n190\n200\n210\n220\n230\n240\n250\n260\n270\n280\n(a) Microgrid voltage\nt(s)\nP(W)\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4\n-1000\n0\n1000\n2000\n3000\n4000\n5000\n6000\n7000\n(b) Active power to the electrical network\nFig. 21.
