Not nearly as far as we may \nhave hoped. In the current era, many of the great advances in the \npsychology of autism have tended to be descriptive: reporting that \nautistic individuals differ in certain capabilities. Y et, for clinicians \nand advocates, we will maximize our ability to make life-enhancing \ninterventions only when we have a causal understanding of how \ncertain cognitive differences produce a wide range of behavioral \nfeatures that constitute the autism phenotype. If we  make a \nparticular modification to the environment, how can we expect it \nto affect autistic individuals? If we design a new intervention to \nenhance a particular cognitive ability, what behavioral outcomes are \nmost likely?\nCausal theories such as Executive Function ( Russell, 1997 ), \nWeak Central Coherence ( Frith, 1989 ), Theory of Mind ( Baron-\nCohen et  al., 1985 ; Rajendran and Mitchell, 2007 ), Predictive \nCoding ( Courchesne and Allen, 1997 ; Pellicano and Burr, 2012 ; \nSinha et  al., 2014 ) and primary social accounts ( Kanner, 1943 ; \nWing, 1988b; Hobson, 1989; Fletcher-Watson and Happé, 2019) are \nmeant to explain causal relationships rather than merely describing \ndifferences with respect to neurotypicals. The concern within \npsychological science about a movement toward description and \naway from the proposal and evaluation of causal theories is not \nunique to the autism literature ( Muthukrishna and Henrich, 2019 ; \nFried, 2020 ; van Rooij and Baggio, 2021 ); a primary goal of the \ncurrent work is to refine an approach that shifts focus back to the \nevaluation of causal accounts.\nIn biomedical science, the strongest approach to establish \ncausality is with experimenter-controlled perturbation of the \nsystem, e.g., the randomized controlled trial (RCT). While there \nis some progress toward very early interventions that have a \ncorollary benefit of shedding light on causal cognitive \nmechanisms ( Grzadzinski et al., 2021 ), most of the work that can \nand will contribute to the evaluation of causal theories in autism \nis bound to be observational. It is well known that the use of \nobservational data to derive causal conclusions is impacted by \nknown and unknown confounds, yet there are approaches to \ndesigning observational tests of causal theories ( Rosenbaum, \n2017) and statistical approaches ( Pearl, 2009 , 2018) that can assist \nin this effort.\nWhen a single theory is under investigation at a time, \nobservational tests of individual causal theories typically rely on \nfalsification: the identification of results that are entailed by the \ntheory and the empiric demonstration through observational data \nthat at least one of these results does not obtain. Because the \nexplanatory power of causal theories depends on their availability to \ngenerate accurate predictions over a wide range of samples, measures \nand experimental contexts (Cronbach and Meehl, 1955; Peirce, 1960; \nRosenbaum, 2017 ), they are inherently susceptible to empirical \nfalsification with observational data.\nSuch was the case with the psychogenic theories of autism, \nthose accounts that held that disordered parenting was \nresponsible for the development of the autism phenotype. A \nnumber of such theories arose during the Psychoanalytic phase \nof Child Psychiatry ( Despert, 1951 ; Rosenberger and Woolf, \n1964; Bettelheim, 1967 ) and even among early Behavioral \nPsychology researchers ( Ferster, 1961 ). Thematically similar \nversions of the theory made somewhat different claims, but the \npsychogenic family of theories as a whole made several common \npredictions, and evidence accumulated against these predictions. \nFor example, for the psychogenic accounts to be  correct, the \nparents of autistic children should consistently show greater-\nthan-typical psychopathology ( DeMyer, 1975 ), and, at least as far \nas Bettelhiem’s version held, children with severe, early social \ndeprivation should exhibit the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) \nphenotype ( Rutter, 1968 ). Not only one, but several  of these \ntheoretically entailed predictions were empirically falsified \n(Rutter, 1968 ; DeMyer, 1975 ).\nIn practice, it is often challenging to falsify a single theory in \nisolation (Adamek et al., 2022); among other concerns, supporters of \na particular theory may “patch” it to reconcile the original claim with \ndisconfirming evidence (Kukla, 2001). Instead, it can be productive \nto test theories in competition, using contrasts between theories to \ntriangulate specific patters of observations that would provide \nsimultaneous support for one theory and disconfirmation of another \n(the approach we take here; Pratt, 1971; Kahneman and Klein, 2009) \nor to examine models quantitatively (“overall model fit” or “relative \nlikelihood”) to determine relative statistical support for one model \nvs. another (Royall, 1997; Burger et al., 2022). Competitive testing \nalso contributed to the evaluation of psychogenic theories of autism, \ninsofar as the literature of the time informally compared evidence for \na psychogenic cause with evidence for a mutually-exclusive “organic” \nor neurological cause of the condition (DeMyer, 1975). Observations \nof the presence of neurological signs in autistic individuals, including \nmotor differences and epilepsy (Tuchman and Rapin, 2002), findings \nwhich could not be attributed to parenting style, were simultaneously \nsupportive of a neurological account and disconfirming for a \npsychogenic account.\nThe goal of the current work was to evaluate several causal \ntheories of key ASD features in competition. This was accomplished \nby formalizing as statistical models what were originally informal, \n“verbal” accounts (van Rooij and Blokpoel, 2020). This formalization \nwas accomplished through close reading of the original literature \n(including the evolution of these theories over time) and the \ntriangulation of areas of theoretical conflict between the different \naccounts. Our statistical tests then focused on specific areas of \nidentified conflict. The set of theories we used was constrained by \ndata-items available in a convenience dataset.\nThe theories examined here focus on the role of language in the \ngenesis of broader aspects of the autism phenotype. Because language \ntheories have generally been discarded through the traditional process \nof evaluation through small samples and dialectic (with a notable \ndegree of graciousness and intellectual honesty on the part of the \noriginal proposers), the empirical tests offered below are not likely to \noffer novel substantive results.

Its origins lay in early observations \nrelating to alterations of low-level auditory perception in autism \n[Anthony, 1958; Rutter, 1965; c.f. more recently (Roberts et al., 2010)]. \nExplicit comparisons were initially made to the social alterations seen \nin children with sensory impairments (hearing loss and combined \nvision-hearing loss; Wing, 1967). Within the milieu of Aphasiology \n(Geschwind, 1965 ), both comparisons ( Rutter, 1968 ) and also \ncontrasts began to be  made between autism and “developmental \naphasia, ” now referred to as Developmental Language Disorder \n(DLD). Social function clearly differed between the two diagnoses, \nand researchers began to focus on the cognitive underpinnings of \nlanguage and the use of symbols in particular as being the driving \nfactor in this difference in social function ( Wing and Wing, 1971; \nChurchill, 1972 ; Ricks and Wing, 1976 ; Rutter, 1978 ). Social \nwithdrawal, which was a sine qua non in the Kannerian view of autism \n[Kanner, 1943 ; Valla et  al., 2013 ; albeit not universal in later \nconceptualizations (Wing and Gould, 1979)], was proposed at the \ntime to be a consequence of frustrated interpersonal interactions due \nto the inability of an autistic child to communicate by either verbal or \nnon-verbal means (Rutter, 1966, 1968; Wing and Wing, 1971), while \na child with DLD and intact use of symbols could establish \nrelationships using preserved non-verbal communication. Restricted \nand repetitive behaviors and interests (RRB) were less explicitly \nexplained by these theories than was social function.\nRestricted and repetitive behaviors and interests was, however, \nexplained by a theory offered by Hermelin and O’Connor, one which \nevolved to compete with Wing, Rutter and collaborators’ language \ntheories. Working in the early days of modern Experimental Cognitive \nPsychology ( Neisser, 1967 ), Hermelin and O'Connor (1970)  \ncontended that a broad cognitive difference could explain both RRB \nand the language/communication phenotype as well as the resulting \nsocial behavior, a cognitive difference whose consequences were \nbroader in scope than the symbolic and language differences offered \nby Wing, Rutter and colleagues. Hermelin and O’Connor’s multiple \nexperimental approaches produced a picture in which autistic children \nhad challenges generating abstract representations of information \npresented, including but not limited to language information. Several \nof their tasks involved the serial presentation of stimuli, both linguistic \nand non-linguistic, and required the participant to guess the next \nelement in a sequence. To do so correctly involved implicitly \nidentifying the rules and relationships among the stimuli presented by \nthe experimenter, so-called “coding. ” Children with autism showed \ndifficulty abstracting the implicit relationships among stimuli and \npredicting the next element over several types of tasks (Hermelin and \nO'Connor, 1970). These coding differences were held up to explain the \nsymbolic differences proposed by Rutter; restated, differences in \nsymbolism supervene on (i.e., are explained by) differences in coding \n(Hermelin, 1978).\nDue both to the higher cognitive workload imposed by \ninefficiencies with abstracting and prediction, autistic individuals were \nunderstood to take action to simplify their environment and make it \nmore predictable (Belmonte, 2008), in a manner we label as RRB.\nPrimary-social theories of autism also stood in contrast with \nlanguage theories. Primary-social theories contended that there is an \nirreducible and innate social motivation or orientation that is \nselectively affected in autism. According to the interpretation of some \nauthors (Wing, 1988b; Hobson, 1989), this causal claim goes back to \nKanner’s original work (Kanner, 1943). In this account, is a primary \ndifference in degree of social engagement in autism that leads to \nalterations in the development of language (Bosch, 1962/1970; Richter, \n1978)—the direction of the causal association is reversed compared \nwith communication theories. Primary and irreducible social \nmotivation (Wing, 1988b; Hobson, 1989; Chevallier et al., 2012; Keifer \net al., 2019 ) and social orienting ( Dawson et al., 1998 ; Zou, 2004) \naccounts of autism have re-emerged recently and are the basis for \ncontemporary infant work that focuses on joint attention ( Mundy \net al., 1986, 1990).\nThe current work leverages the Simons Foundation Powering \nAutism Research (SPARK) Database (SPARK Consortium, 2018). This \ndatabase, which was designed to collect genetic and behavioral \n(individual−/parent-report) data from 50,000 autistic individuals and \ntheir parents, has, at time of the current data release, registered over \n71,000 individuals with ASD and a total of over 283,000 individuals \n(with ASD and parent/siblings) in total.\nOur goal was to evaluate language theories of autism alongside the \n“coding” and primary social theories that developed in explicit \ncompetition in the literature, using a single, large dataset. In doing so, \nwe accumulated “lessons learned” for this type of sparse (theoretically \nconstrained) network analysis.\nGeneral methods\nSimons Powering Autism Research (SPARK) \ndataset, participant selection criteria, and \ndemographics\nWe used Release 5 (December 2020) of the SPARK dataset, which \nincluded data from a total of 283,520 individuals, of which 94,116 \nwere children (<18 years) diagnosed with ASD or their siblings \n(“Sibs”). Data cleaning procedures have been described in Dillon et al. \n(2021). The data were collected under the SPARK protocol (Western \nInstitutional Review Board, Inc.). No identifying data were transmitted \nto Johns Hopkins Medicine. We included children >5 years of age to \nhave increased confidence in the assessment of language and cognition \n(Ewen et al., 2019) and because some items referred to performance \nat age 4–5 years. We  further restricted the sample to participants \n<18 years of age because older individuals completed a somewhat \ndifferent set of items. We excluded data from all individuals who had \nmissing responses to any item studied. Missingness was believed to \nbe due to task persistence on the part of the family member filling out \nthe instruments and unrelated to the associations studied and not \nreflective of the effort of the participants themselves. In the end, our \ndataset included 12,652 children with a parent-reported ASD \ndiagnosis (68% male; 15% also had a parent-reported Intellectual \nDisability [ID] diagnosis) and 9,571 Sibs (34% male; 1.4% with a \nparent-reported ID diagnosis). Demographic variables are presented \nin Table 1. Family of origin was recorded (Family Identity variable), \nand 4,327 families contributed data on both ASD participants and Sibs \n(4,495 ASD and 4,469 Sib participants in total). Age distribution is \nTang et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1060525\nFrontiers in Psychology 04 frontiersin.org\npresented in Figure 1. Between-group distributional differences in Age \nwere negligible (Cohen’s d = 0.096).\nASD diagnosis was assessed via parent−/caregiver-report, with \nthe explicit instruction that it should be based on a clinical diagnosis \n(Fombonne et  al., 2022). Sex was recorded as parent −/guardian-\nreported biological sex at birth. Age was recorded at the time that the \ninstrument was completed. Most items were asked in terms of \nfunction contemporaneous to time the instrument was filled out, but \nsome items from the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) \n(Rutter et al., 2003) ask the parent/guardian to recall function at age \n4–5 years. SCQ scores for the ASD group were 22.95 ± 6.57 \n(mean ± SD), range = 9–39; SCQ scores for the TD group were \n3.59 ± 4.59 (mean ± SD), range = 0–38 (Figure 2).\nItem selection and psychological construct \nbuilding and validation\nFollowing literature review around causal theories of key features \nof ASD, the investigator team reviewed data items collected in this \nTABLE 1 Demographic variables.\nASD-only Sibs-only ASD+Sibs\nCurrent Age 9.8y (±3.4 [s.d.]) 10.1y (±3.5 [s.d.]) 9.9y (±3.4 [s.d.])\nAge at Diagnosis 5.0y (±2.8 [s.d.])\nSex 80% male 49% male 67% male\nRace\n  African American 9.4% 2.0% 6.2%\n  Asian 3.9% 1.0% 2.7%\n  Native American 3.7% 0.7% 2.4%\n  Native Hawaiian/Pacific 0.87% 0.2% 0.6%\n  White 88.8% 24.2% 61.0%\n  Other 3.9% 1.6% 3.9%\n  More than one 20.3% 2.9% 12.8%\nEthnic Hispanic 16.3% 4.8% 11.3%\nFamily Income\n  <$20 k 11.5% 8.5% 10.2%\n  $21 k-35 k 15.0% 11.6% 13.6%\n  $36 k-50 k 14.3% 13.3% 13.9%\n  $51 k-65 k 10.6% 10.3% 10.5%\n  $66 k-80 k 11.2% 11.4% 11.3%\n  $81 k-100 k 11.5% 12.5% 11.9%\n  $101 k-130 k 12.0% 13.2% 12.4%\n  >$131-160 k 5.3% 6.6% 5.8%\n  >161 k 8.8% 12.6% 10.4%\nHighest Parental Education\n  Did not attend high school 0.05% 0.06% 0.05%\n  Some high school 0.8% 0.7% 0.8%\n  GED diploma 1.7% 1.3% 1.5%\n  High school graduate 7.4% 6.7% 7.1%\n  Trade school 6.4% 5.3% 5.9%\n  Some college 15.3% 13.1% 14.4%\n  Associate’s degree 15.2% 14.0% 14.7%\n  Bachelor’s degree 26.9% 28.3% 27.5%\n  Graduate/Professional school 26.3% 30.5% 28.0%\nIntellectual disability diagnosis 15.4% 1.4% 9.4%\nLanguage disorder diagnosis 47.5% 7.04% 30.1%\nPrescribed medication 56.4% Not reported\nPercentages for Race may not sum to 1 because individual participants may opt out of responding or may select multiple categories.\nTang et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1060525\nFrontiers in Psychology 05 frontiersin.org\nrelease. We determined that we had sufficient items to evaluate some \nof the claims regarding communication theories of autism. We used \nitems from the following tables of the SPARK release: Basic Medical \nScreening, Background History–Child (ASD only), the Background \nHistory–Sibling (Sib only), the Repetitive Behaviors Scale–Revised \n(Lam and Aman, 2007; ASD only), and the SCQ (Rutter et al., 2003). \nItems related to each theoretical construct, as they were discussed in \nthe literature, were grouped, and we  tested construct fit using a \nconfirmatory factor analysis (CFA). We set our criteria as a root mean \nsquare of error approximation (RMSEA) < 0.05 (Kim and Mueller, \n1978; Brown, 2015) and standardized root mean squared residuals \n(SRMR) < 0.08 (Kim and Mueller, 1978; Brown, 2015). Any construct \nthat did not initially meet these criteria was split into two factors, and \nthe factor with the more theoretically-relevant items was selected and \nrefit. Each individual participant’s value for each construct was derived \nfrom Multivariate Item Response Theory (MIRT), and a normal \ndistribution was imposed on each group. For a few constructs with few \nitems, quantification was obtained via Principal Components Analysis \n(PCA) or as the value of a single item, in cases where only a single item \npertained to the construct. Because the ASD and sibling samples \nincluded somewhat different items (i.e., the Sibs’ data did not include \nthe RBS-R and some items in the background history), some \nconstructs in the ASD-Only analysis differed in item composition \nfrom their corresponding partners in the ASD + Sibs analyzes. All data \nitems present in the Sibs cohort were available in the ASD cohort, but \nnot vice versa. Therefore the constructs in the ASD-Only cohort in \nsome cases derived from a greater number of items than items than \ncorresponding constructs in the Sibs (and therefore ASD + Sibs) \ncohort. We examined correlations between the “finer” constructs in \nthe ASD-Only sample and the corresponding “coarser” constructs in \nthe ASD + Sibs sample.\nItems in individual constructs\nFor the Verbal Language construct, the ASD + Sibs analyzes \nincluded the following items:\n • Age in months when first used single words\n • Age in months when first combined words into short phrases or \nsentences with an action word\n • Age in months when first combined phrases into longer sentences\n • Please select all conditions that you/your child/dependent have/\nhas been diagnosed with by a professional.

We  identified causal claims related to the role of language \ndifferences as causing essential features of autism, as well as \ncontemporaneous claims for abstraction/prediction accounts and \nsocial-primary accounts that competed with language theories. \nWe  modeled theories as causal graphs with a structure that was \nconsistent with the original authors’ intent as we  understood it. \nGraphs were constructed for those causal claims for which there were \nadequate items to generate derived constructs in the SPARK dataset. \nStatistical tests were chosen to evaluate key claims on which the causal \nmodel depended, or to highlight areas of explicit contrast between \ncompeting claims.\nWe examined each of the causal theories below using two cohorts: \n(1) participants diagnosed with ASD only and (2) ASD participants + \nnon-ASD siblings (“Sibs”). Modeling of relationships used Generalized \nAdditive Models (GAM) to account for both linear and second-order \neffects. Covariates are discussed below; Family Identity was a random \neffect in all ASD + Sib models. The overall approach to competitive \nhypothesis testing was “edge-in/edge-out” comparisons rather than \noverall model fit. Because we  accounted for nonlinear effects, the \nprimary metric of effect size was change in variance explained between \none model and its contrast ( Δr2). As the graphs were highly \ntheoretically constrained, some of the methodological concerns \nassociated with data-driven graph-fitting approaches do not apply \nhere, however we have otherwise attempted to comply with recently-\npublished guidelines for network analysis with psychological data \n(Burger et al., 2022). analyzes were carried out using R version 1.4.3. \nGAMS were performed using the mgcv package (v. 1.8.40), MIRT was \nusing the mirt package (v. 1.33.2), and factor analysis using the lavaan \npackage (v. 0.6–9).\nWe covaried for and examined the moderating effect of several \npotentially confounding variables, to account for alternative \nhypotheses that were not explicated in the literature; our theoretical \njustification for each is described in the subsections that follow \nimmediately below. Covariates included, for both cohorts, Age, Sex, \nand Highest Parental Education (“Parental Education”).1 Within the \nASD-Only cohort, we also examined for the effect of Family Type \n(simplex/multiplex). We had additional interest in the impact of DLD \ndiagnosis within the ASD-Only cohort, and ASD diagnosis within the \nASD + Sibs cohort. The statistical approach was as follows: as our \nprimary outcome, we contrasted (Δr2) a covariates-only GAM and a \nGAM that contained the covariates plus the theoretically specified \npredictors. To assess the potential moderating impact of DLD \nDiagnosis within the ASD-Only group, we next ran a model that also \nincluded a DLD Diagnosis covariate and DLD interaction terms with \nall predictors and all other covariates. In the ASD + Sibs cohort, \nwe examined the moderating effect of ASD Diagnosis via a model that \nincluded an ASD Diagnosis covariate, ASD Diagnosis interaction \nterms (with all other predictors and covariates, including \nDLD diagnosis).\n1 We use lower-case labels for abstract constructs (e.g., social withdrawal) \nand upper-case labels for the variables used to quantify those constructs in \nour models (e.g., Social Withdrawal, Age).\nTang et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1060525\nFrontiers in Psychology 08 frontiersin.org\nModerating effect of age\nThis convenience sample did not contain longitudinal data, which \nis a limitation given that some of the theories as proposed were \ndevelopmental (particularly Models 1 and 4; Happé, 2001), in the \nsense that they posited that a certain level of function in the “causally \nupstream” domain would cascade over time and eventually result in a \nchange in relative performance in the “causally downstream” domain. \nThat is to say that there should be a time-lag between the value of a \n“upstream” construct and the effect on the value of a “downstream” \nconstruct. However, this theorized lag would likely result in a \nmoderating effect of Age (assuming our sampling from 5–18 years \ncaptures the developmentally relevant ages at which the lag occurs, \nand with adequate temporal granularity).\nModerating effect of sex\nAlthough the field is at an early stage of understanding sex \ndifferences in autism, there is considerable evidence that they exist in \na variety of biological and cognitive domains ( Ferri et  al., 2018). \nMoreover, there are known sex differences in language development, \neven if they are not as great as previously believed (Etchell et al., 2018).\nModerating effect of parental education\nParental education is known to affect both language development \n(Roberts et al., 1999) and social development (Hediger et al., 2002), and \ntherefore may confound hypothesized relationships between the two.\nModerating effect of family type (simplex/\nmultiplex)\nAs the field sorts out genetic (Bai et al., 2019) and environmental \ninteractions that contribute to the development of the autism \nbehavioral phenotype, it has been hypothesized that the cognitive \narchitecture of autism could differ in affected individuals from families \nwith multiple relatives having autism (“multiplex”) vs. autistic \nindividuals who have no close relatives with the condition (“simplex”; \nOerlemans et al., 2016).\nModerating effect of autism spectrum \ndisorder diagnosis\nIn most of the models tested here, the original authors used social \nwithdrawal as the behavioral explanandum (“that which must \nbe explained, ” i.e., the behavioral consequence of whichever cognitive \nmechanism is being examined). While we currently understand that \nsocial withdrawal is not a universal feature of individuals who carry an \nASD diagnosis (Wing and Gould, 1979; Wing, 1996; Phillips et al., \n2019; Neuhaus et al., 2021), the theories we are evaluating tended to \nconflate social withdrawal with what is now viewed as a broad range of \nautistic social-communication and social-interaction differences. \nBecause autism encompasses a wide and heterogeneous range of \ncognitive and behavioral differences, it is possible that unmodeled \ncognitive and behavioral characteristics could confound the \nrelationships that are explicitly modeled. Within the analyzes of the \nASD + Sibs cohort, we therefore measured the moderating effect of \ndiagnosis (i.e., the unmodeled autism-related features).\nModerating effects of developmental \nlanguage disorder diagnosis\nDiagnostic criteria for autism and ASD have changed from the \ntime that the theories studied here were first proposed to the time \nwhen SPARK participants enrolled (Rosen et al., 2021). Relevant to \nthe current purposes, the role of language in autism diagnosis has \nchanged over this time. In prior decades, language differences were a \nnecessary diagnostic criterion of the condition ( Wing and Gould, \n1979). However, more inclusive diagnostic criteria, including those for \nAsperger syndrome in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental \nDisorders (DSM-IV) ( American Psychiatric Association, 2000 ), \ndiagnosed individuals who did not experience significant language \ndelays; the current version of the DSM does not include language \ndifferences as a diagnostic criterion ( American Psychiatric \nAssociation, 2013; Rosen et al., 2021). This change over history raises \nthe concern that the range of language performance of individuals \nsampled in the SPARK dataset is broader than the range of individuals \nbeing described by the authors of the theories studied herein.\nPrimary conclusions were made on the models without accounting \nfor the DLD diagnosis, as covarying for DLD would regress out theory-\ntargeting language ability from the model, potentially resulting an \nunderestimation of the link between language and social withdrawal, \nthus increasing risk for spurious falsification. However, to examine for \npotential biases caused by sampling on a population that has a broader \nrange of language performance than studied by the original theorists, \nwe secondarily measured DLD moderation effects.\nModel 1: Altered language and social \nwithdrawal\nIntroduction\nEarly descriptive observations comparing DLD and autism in \nchildren found that children with autism had alterations in both \nverbal language and non-verbal communication ( Rutter et  al., \n1971; Rutter, 1978 ). Multiple groups hypothesized that social \nwithdrawal typical of autism might be a direct consequence of these \npervasive challenges in communicative ability: “ …the poverty of \nsocial contact follows from the profound impairment in the \ndevelopment of all forms of language and therefore to the lack of \ntools necessary for interpersonal communication” ( Wing and \nWing, 1971 ); “ …language disorder in autism is the primary \nabnormality…and not one which is secondary to social withdrawal” \n(Rutter, 1968); “ …aphasia in itself is sufficient to account for the \nmarked aloofness and lack of warmth shown by the [autistic] child” \n(expressed in the language of the time by one of the greatest \ncontributors to the understanding of autism; Rutter, 1966).\nSuch a developmental relationship seems plausible, even in the \ncurrent day. Consider the example of the acquired aphasia syndrome \nof Landau–Kleffner (LKS), in which nocturnal epileptiform activity \ncauses a receptive aphasia that, in some cases, appears to result in \nsecondary social withdrawal (Besag and Vasey, 2019).\nTang et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1060525\nFrontiers in Psychology 09 frontiersin.org\nWe were conscious of the fact that the items in the Non-Verbal \nCommunication construct assess, in part, the communicative \nintent and tendency  to produce gestures and other types of \nnon-verbal behaviors, and not solely the ability to do so (This fact \ncontrasts with the Verbal Language construct, whose items target \nlanguage ability rather than communicative use of that ability). \nGiven the sensitivity of Non-Verbal communicative construct to \ncommunicative intent, we were concerned for conceptual overlap \nbetween Non-Verbal Communication and Social Withdrawal.\nMethods\nAn efficient way to falsify a directed association between \ncommunicative performance and social withdrawal is to demonstrate \nthe absence of the corresponding undirected association (Pearl, 2018). \nWe used a GAM to estimate the independent and joint associations \nbetween Non-Verbal Communication and Verbal Language \n(predictors) with Social Withdrawal (outcome), and we compared a \ncovariate-only model with a model also including Non-Verbal \nCommunication and Verbal Language predictors. Covariates were \nincluded, and moderating effects were estimated as defined in the \nGeneral Methods. We also estimated the moderating effect size of \nGeneral Intelligence in both cohorts.\nResults\nIn our sample, 47.5% of children with ASD also reported a \nLanguage Disorder diagnosis; 7.0% of Sibs did. In the ASD-Only \nmodel, the covariates alone explained 7.1% of the variance in Social \nWithdrawal. There were additional statistically significant marginal \nassociations between Verbal Language and Social Withdrawal \n(Δr2 = 6.5%; p < 10−10 compared with the covariates-only model) and \nbetween Non-Verbal Communication and Social Withdrawal \n(Δr2 = 19.7%; p < 10−10, compared with the covariates-only model). \nVerbal Language and Non-Verbal Communication jointly predicted \n23.0% of the variance in Social Withdrawal.\nSome interaction terms including DLD were statistically \nsignificant (DLD × intercept and DLD × Verbal Language), but the \noverall model fit did not change when DLD covariate and interaction \nterms were added to the model. For example, the r2 changed by less \nthan 1 percentage point. The General Intelligence moderation effect \nincreased the model r2 by 1.1 percentage points.\nIn the combined ASD + Sibs cohort, after adjusting for covariates, \nthere were statistically significant marginal associations between \nVerbal Language and Social Withdrawal ( Δr2 = 19.1%, p < 10−6 \ncompared with covariates-only model) and between Non-Verbal \nCommunication and Social Withdrawal ( Δr2 = 45.4%, p < 10−6) \ncompared with covariates only model. Together, Verbal Language and \nNon-Verbal Communication jointly predicted 49.5% of the variance \nin Social Withdrawal.\nDevelopmental language disorder, as a covariate as well as a \nmoderating effect, contributed <1 percentage point to the total \nvariance. The General Intelligence moderation effect increased the \nmodel r2 by 2.3 percentage points.\nSeveral other interaction effects among predictors and covariates \nwere statistically significant, however, their effect sizes were negligible, \nrepresenting a less than 1 percentage point difference in r2 between \nmodels where the interaction terms were included versus those where \nthey were excluded.\nThe ASD diagnostic interaction effect was significant (p < 10−6), \nand the Δr2 (including vs. dropping diagnostic interaction effects) was \n13.0 percentage points. Insofar as the diagnostic moderation effect \ninherits the variance from unmeasured, ASD-related confounds, these \nconfounds accounted for about 21% of the association between Verbal \nLanguage/Non-Verbal Communication and Social Withdrawal.\nDiscussion\nThe demonstration of an undirected association between \nspoken and unspoken aspects of communicative ability (Verbal \nLanguage and Non-Verbal Communication) failed to falsify \ntheoretical claims that variation in language function causes \nvariation in social withdrawal symptoms. However, alternative \nexplanations of this correlation are equally supported by these \nnon-directional analyzes, including the possibility that degree of \nsocial withdrawal leads to altered language development (explicitly \ntested in Model 4, below). The DLD Diagnosis moderation effect in \nthe ASD-Only cohort was small, disconfirming the notion that the \nmechanics of language development are different within autism \nclassifications that require co-occurring DLD and those that include \nindividuals with a broader range of language performance.\nThe association between Verbal Language/Non-Verbal \nCommunication and Social Withdrawal held up in both the \nASD-Only and ASD + Sibs cohorts. Because the association was seen \nin the ASD-Only cohort, we are safe from the possibility that the \nmeasured association is simply an artifact of other, unmeasured \nASD-specific characteristics. The ASD-Diagnostic interaction term \nwas about 21% of magnitude of the total effect, suggesting  \nmore variance in Social Withdrawal is explained by Verbal  \nLanguage and Non-Verbal Confounds than by unmeasured, \nASD-related confounds.\nWe are conscious of limitations of the Non-Verbal Communication \nconstruct in this convenience sample, which does not adequately parse \nthe ability to produce gestures and other non-verbal behaviors from the \nsocial intent or tendency to generate these behaviors. This social intent \nmay have conceptual overlap with the notions of social withdrawal and \nmay thus overestimate the association between these two constructs. \nWithin the diagnostic clinic and daily life of affected families, however, \nthe combination of social/communicative intent and communicative \nability combine to inform the social-communication diagnostic \ncriterion for ASD (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).\nWithout further constraints in the model, the causal inference \nsupported by these limited results is indeed open to circularity \n(Morton, 2005 ), viz., that a non-directed statistical relationship \nbetween clinical aspects of a diagnosis and the presence of a diagnosis \nmay be misinterpreted as evidence that those particular clinical aspects \nare causative of the range of behaviors encompassed in the diagnosis.\nVerbal Lang\nNV Comm Social Withdrawal\nTang et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1060525\nFrontiers in Psychology 10 frontiersin.org\nModel 2: Dys-symbolic theory\nIntroduction\nRutter’s initial proposals, tested above, invoked social withdrawal \ncaused by frustration due to altered language performance and \nuncompensated for by non-verbal communication abilities. However, \nthe literature evolved to hypothesize a central symbolic difference \nspecific to autism and necessary not only for language performance \nbut also for social engagement ( Wing and Wing, 1971 ; Churchill, \n1972; Ricks and Wing, 1976; Rutter, 1978). DLD children, in contrast \nto those with autism, demonstrated symbolic ability through intact \nnon-verbal language (Rutter, 1978) and through imaginative play. \nWithin the literature, imaginative play, verbal language and non-verbal \ncommunication were consistently discussed as manifestations of \nsymbolic ability (Sheridan, 1969; Wing et al., 1977; Hermelin, 1978). \nThe goal of this model was to examine the degree to which inter-\nindividual differences in symbolic function could exist, as bounded by \nthe shared variance among Verbal Language, Non-Verbal \nCommunication and Imaginative Play constructs, and whether this \nlatent factor is associated with Social Withdrawal.\nMethods\nThree statistical inferences were needed to support—and each \nhad the potential to falsify—key aspects of the causal model as \nproposed above. Firstly, for a latent factor representing symbolism to \nexist, there must exist joint variance shared among Verbal Language, \nNon-Verbal Communication and Imaginative Play variables. The \npresence of such a joint variance space does not guarantee that this \nvariation validly represents Rutter’s, Rick’s and Wing’s notion of \nsymbolism, but the absence of such a space would deal a sharp blow \nto the claim. Secondly, individual variability in this joint variance \nspace must correlate with the value of Social Withdrawal. Thirdly, \nprediction of social withdrawal by Verbal Language, Non-Verbal \nCommunication and Imaginative Play must by dominated by the \njoint variance space which we label “Symbolism, ”2 and not from the \n2 We use scare quotes in speaking about “Symbolism” because this factor is \ndefined solely in statistical terms as a joint variance space shared from other \nconstructs, and not based on specific items that get to the conceptual construct \nof symbolism, as we have with these other constructs. We consider below that \nthere may other conceptual constructs, apart from symbolism, that could also \nexplain this joint variance space.\nmarginal (non-“Symbolism”) variance of the Verbal Language and \nNon-Verbal Communication constructs.\nTo that end, we fit “Symbolism” as the dominant factor across \nVerbal Language, Non-Verbal Communication and Imaginative Play \nconstructs, using a confirmatory factor analysis, independently in the \nASD-Only ASD + Sibs cohorts.\nSecondly, we used a GAM to estimate the association between this \n“Symbolism” factor and Social Withdrawal. Covariates and interaction \neffects were handled in the same as in Model 1.\nThirdly, we added the original Verbal Language and Non-Verbal \nCommunication terms as predictors to the above models, separately \nin the ASD-Only cohort and in the ASD + Sibs cohort.\nResults\nIn the ASD-Only group, a joint space explained a good deal of \nvariance among Verbal Language ( r2 = 24.4%), Non-Verbal \nCommunication (r2 = 52.2%) and Imaginative Play (r2 = 90.7%), which \nwe labeled the “Symbolism” factor. The ASD + Sibs sample showed a \nsimilar latent construct (Verbal Language r2 = 39.4%; Non-Verbal \nCommunication r2 = 73.1%; Imaginative Play r2 = 93.1%).\nIn the ASD-Only group, this “Symbolism” latent factor \nsignificantly accounted for 29.0% of the variance in Social Withdrawal \nbeyond covariates alone, including both direct effects and those \nmediated by Verbal Language and Non-Verbal Communication. \nWhen we further added the unique effects of Verbal Language and \nNon-Verbal Communication (i.e., not originating with “Symbolism”), \nthe variance explained in Social Withdrawal increased by a small \ndegree, from 29.0 to 30.9%.\nAll interaction terms, including the DLD Diagnosis term, \naccounted for Δr2 < 1%. General Intelligence interaction terms, added \nseparately, increased the model r2 by 1 percentage point.\nIn the ASD + Sibs sample, the “Symbolism” factor significantly \naccounted for 60.2% of the variance in Social Withdrawal beyond \ncovariates alone; adding the original Verbal Language and Non-Verbal \nCommunication constructs increased the correlation (r2) only to 61.7%.\nIn ASD-Only samples, we observed a few statistically significant \ninteraction terms, including the moderating role of DLD diagnosis, \nbut the Δr2 < 1% for all interaction terms, including General \nIntelligence. In the ASD + Sibs cohort, the ASD-Diagnostic \nmoderating effect was significant ( p < 10−6), and the r2 changed by \n7.1 percentage points when the ASD-Diagnostic interaction terms \nwere dropped. Insofar as the diagnostic moderation effect inherits \nthe variance from unmeasured, diagnosis-related variables \n(confounders or other), these variables accounted for about an \nadditional 10% of the association between “Symbolism” and \nSocial Withdrawal.\nVerbal Language\nNV Comm\nSocial \nWithdraw\nSymbolism\nImagina/g415ve Play\nTang et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1060525\nFrontiers in Psychology 11 frontiersin.org\nDiscussion\nIn the absence of a direct and unambiguous measure of symbolism, \nit is impossible to know that the latent factor represented by shared \nvariance space of Verbal Language, Non-Verbal Communication and \nImaginative Play truly and specifically represents the original authors’ \nnotion of symbolism. Nevertheless, the fact that there exists a latent factor \nwith these properties, as predicted by theory, is non-trivial. Moreover, the \nfact that variance associated with this “Symbolism” latent factor explains \nmost of the effect of communication constructs on Social Withdrawal is \nalso non-trivially in line with theoretical predictions.\nAs in Model 1, however, these analyzes did not indicate the \ndirection of the association.\nThese results also provide soft evidence to address concerns about \nthe potential conceptual confounding of the Non-Verbal \nCommunication construct with aspects of social engagement/\nwithdrawal. Specifically, we believe that the Verbal Language construct \ndoes not suffer the same confounding (i.e., it veridically measures \nlanguage ability without being confounded with social/communicative \nintent). The “Symbolism” construct is generated as the shared variance \nspace of Verbal Language and Non-Verbal Communication (as well \nas Imaginative Play), and therefore is expected to contain less variance \nassociated with social/communicative intent than is the original \nNon-Verbal Communication construct. If this social-intent-related \nvariance contained in Non-Verbal Communication were large, \nwe would expect that the association would be considerably stronger \nwhen Social Withdrawal is correlated with “Symbolism” plus the \noriginal Non-Verbal Communication construct than by “Symbolism” \nalone. This large increase was not observed (i.e., adding in both \nNon-Verbal Communication as well as Verbal Language increased r2 \nonly by about 2 percentage points in each cohort).\nModel 3: “Coding”\nIntroduction\nHermelin and O'Connor’s (1970)  research demonstrated that \nautistic children have difficulty inferring the latent rules that underlie \nsequences and subsequently predicting the next element in a sequence \n(“coding”), whether those sequences are linguistic in nature or \nnon-linguistic. They therefore viewed coding as a more fundamental \nfunction than symbolism—and one whose alteration in autism affects \nnot only symbolic function, and therefore language production, but \nalso non-linguistic phenomena as well ( Hermelin, 1978). Quoting \nHermelin (1978), “it would be an oversimplification to attribute the \ncognitive pathology in autism primarily to an impaired language \nsystem. According to our results, such an interpretation fails to take \naccount of the restricted access which autistic children seem to have \nalso to other, nonlinguistic representations. ”\nOur dataset does not include a direct experimental measurement \nof coding, such as in Hermelin and O'Connor (1970), but we can make \nsome progress if we include Hermelin and O'Connor’s (1970) auxiliary \npremise that RRB is a secondary attempt to simplify the inputs from \nthe physical world because of this alteration in coding/prediction. \nRutter actively dismissed the non-linguistic implications of Hermelin \nand O’Connor’s coding findings, suggesting that the non-linguistic \nmanifestations were confounded by “one important limitation and \nthat is that in many of their studies the children [had ID]” ( Rutter, \n1978). This counter-claim was a bit tenuous on its face, even at the \ntime of its initial proposal, given Hermelin and O’Connor’s ID control \ngroup, but for completeness’ sake, we test it here.\nMethods\nWe attempted to answer two questions: whether symbolism/\ncoding (again operationalized as joint variance space of Verbal \nLanguage, Non-Verbal Communication and Imaginative Play) also \npredicted RRB (consistent with the view of Hermelin and O’Connor) \nand whether any relationship between symbolism/coding and RRB \nwas obliterated by adjusting for General Intelligence (consistent with \nthe response of Rutter).\nTo that end, we used RRB as the outcome variable within a GAM, \nwith the “Symbolism” factor as the predictor, as contrasted with the \ncovariates-only model. Our test to determine whether general \nintelligence explained RRB better than coding/symbolism was to \ncompare the original model with one adjusting for the General \nIntelligence construct. Note that different versions of the RRB \nconstructs and General Intelligence constructs were used in the \nASD-Only models vs. ASD + Sibs models.\nResults\n15.4% of participants in the ASD cohort reported diagnoses of ID, \nAs Did 1.4% of sibs.\nIn the ASD-Only cohort, there was a significant association \nbetween “Symbolism” and RRB ( r2 = 2.1%), after adjusting for \ncovariates. After adjusting for General Intelligence, there was no \nGeneral Intelligence\nVerbal Language\nSocial \nWithdrawal\nImaginative Play\nRRB\nNV Comm\nCoding\nSymbolism\nTang et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1060525\nFrontiers in Psychology 12 frontiersin.org\nsignificant decrease in the association between “Symbolism” and RRB, \nand the effect curve between these two constructs did not change \nsignificantly before and after adjusting for General Intelligence.\nAll interaction effects (including those associated with DLD) \ncontributed 1.26% of variance, while the Parent Education × Sex \ninteraction term is the only one that is statistically significant.\nIn the ASD + Sibs cohort, the model again demonstrated a \nsignificant link between “Symbolism” and RRB ( r2 = 38.6%), after \nadjusting for covariates. After adjusting for General intelligence, there \nwas no decrease in the magnitude of the association between \n“Symbolism” and RRB. Additionally, the effect curve between \n“Symbolism” and RRB did not change significantly before vs. after \nadjusting for General Intelligence (meaning the effect of \n“Symbolism” → RRB cannot be  explained by the confounding of \nGeneral Intelligence).\nAll significant interaction terms contributed <1 percentage point \nof effect size.\nThe moderating effect of ASD Diagnosis was again significant \n(p < 10−6), but only contributed <1 percentage point to the model r2.\nDiscussion\nIn summary, the association, albeit modest, between our \n“Symbolism” factor and RRB supports (or fails to falsify) Hermelin \nand O’Connor’s claim that there exists a coding capacity that serves \nboth the symbolic nature of language and also non-linguistic features \nof autism. Rutter’s claim that the non-linguistic/non-social features of \nautism are associated with ID rather than being a consequence of the \nsame construct that supports the symbolic function of language is \nundermined by the statistical inability of General Intelligence to \nexplain the empirical relationship between “Symbolism” and RRB.\nThe strength of the conclusions is supported not only by similar \nresults from two samples in this analysis, but also by two different sets \nof items to measure both General Intelligence and RRB in the different \ncohorts. In light of anecdotal concerns about covariance in caregiver-\nreport items and issues with recall bias (affecting the items in the \nASD + Sibs version of the General Intelligence construct), it would \nbe preferable to have the results of IQ testing performed by qualified \npsychometricians. Doing so would allow us to determine whether the \nIQ distribution in our sample was skewed and to determine \nparametrically whether there were different relationships between IQ \nand RRB at different ranges of the IQ dimension (Note that for statistical \ntesting purposes, our non-linear models accounted for this possibility.)\nModel 4: Dyscultural model\nIntroduction\nThe first model, and its elaborations in Models 2 and 3, focused \non the role of impaired communication (and its cognitive bases) as \ncausing social withdrawal in ASD. Alternative accounts posited that \nsocial withdrawal is primary and subsequently causes impairments in \nlanguage development [ Bosch, 1962/1970 ; Richter, 1978 ; also \ndiscussed in Rutter (1978)].\nWe know today that differences in social attention can affect rates \nof language development in children generally ( Boucher, 2011a). \nWe further know that language exposure can affect verbal development \n(Hoff and Tian, 2005), and the social withdrawal observed in some \nautistic children often engenders less expressive language from others \n(Wozniak et al., 2017).\nMethods\nThe goal for this model contrast was to determine causal \ndirectionality between social withdrawal on the one hand and verbal \nlanguage/nonverbal communication on the other. To this end, we took \nadvantage of the concept of conditional independence (Waldmann and \nMartignon, 1998). It works on the following reasoning: if inter-\nindividual variability in a single cause (here, Social Withdrawal) results \nin inter-individual variability in an effect, then the values of the cause \nand effect variables will correlate with each other across participants. \nIf the cause results in two effects (here, Non-Verbal Communication \nand Verbal Language), then the cause variable will correlate with each \nof the effect variables. Moreover, because effect 1 and effect 2 each \ncorrelates with the cause variable, then effect1 and effect2 will necessarily \ncorrelate with each other. Finally, because the relationship between \neffect1 and effect2 is due (at least to some degree) to the shared variance \ninherited from the cause variable, if one partials out the value of the \ncause variable from the effect1-effect2 correlation, then the effect size of \nthe effect1-effect2 correlation would necessarily decrease.\nResults\nIn the ASD-Only sample, the Pearson’s correlation between Verbal \nLanguage and Non-Verbal Communication (covaried for Age, Sex, \nParental Education, and Family Type) dropped from r = 0.085 \n(p < 10−9) to 0.031 (p = 0.025) when adjusted for Social Withdrawal for \nchildren diagnosed with DLD. In children not diagnosed with DLD, \nthe drop was from 0.086 (p < 10−9) to 0.025 (p = 0.06, not statistically \nsignificant) when conditioning on Social Withdrawal. In both \nsub-cohorts, the drop in effect size and increase in value of p indicates \nthat verbal language and non-verbal communication cannot be  a \ncommon cause of social withdrawal.\nIn the ASD + Sibs sample, we saw a drop from r = 0.145 (p < 10−10) \nto r = 0.057 (p < 10−10). Although this drop in effect size suggests that \nit is most likely that the communication→social withdrawal link does \nnot obtain, the value of p remained small.\nDiscussion\nThe use of a test of conditional independence allowed us to \nevaluate the direction of the association between social engagement \nand communicative function. Contrary to the language-primary \ntheories of ASD, the results in the ASD-Only group are inconsistent \nwith the notion that variability in verbal language and non-verbal \nVerbal Language\nNV Comm\nSocial \nWithdrawal\nTang et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1060525\nFrontiers in Psychology 13 frontiersin.org\ncommunication are common causes of social withdrawal. The results \nof the ASD + Sibs cohort did not meet the strict criterion by which the \nassociation between Verbal Language and Non-Verbal \nCommunication would have been reduced to non-significance once \nSocial Withdrawal was adjusted for, though the effect size ( r2) did \nshow a numerical decrease by a factor of more than five.\nWhile the graph holding that social withdrawal affects the \ndevelopment of verbal language and non-verbal communication is \nsupported by this analysis, other graphs are equally well supported, \nincluding non-verbal communication being the primary alteration \n(Mundy et al., 1986, 1990). Additional observations with a greater \nnumber of constructs or even interventions may be needed to decide \namong these remaining possibilities.\nGeneral discussion\nSubstantive conclusions about \nlanguage-primary theories of autism and \nalternative accounts\nWhen we synthesize the results of all our models, two substantive \nconclusions regarding the language theories of autism remain, one \nrelating to the direction of the causal association between social \nwithdrawal and communicative performance, and one relating to the \nexistence of a symbolism/coding construct and its association with \nsocial withdrawal and RRB. Regarding the first conclusion, the \nevidence from causal modeling of SPARK data makes it unlikely that \nvariation in language and non-verbal communicative ability \nunidirectionally influences social withdrawal/engagement ( Rutter, \n1966, 1968; Wing and Wing, 1971). The claim that social withdrawal \naffects language development and non-verbal communication (Bosch, \n1962/1970; Richter, 1978) is supported by the results, but we should \nrecognize that equally supported are graphs in which, for example, \nnon-verbal communication → social engagement/withdrawal → \nverbal language [c.f. Mundy et al., 1986)]. More complex interactions, \nsuch as a feedback loop (Wozniak et al., 2017), also cannot be resolved \nby the current methods. Because “any finite set of data can be explained \nby any of an infinite number of equations, ” our strongest conclusion is \nthat the results are inconsistent with and help falsify the accounts that \nhold language as a primary influence on social withdrawal, such as \nexpounded by Rutter. Insofar as our conclusions are convergent with \nthe actual evolution of the literature, Rutter himself later reversed his \nposition and later endorsed the conclusion we have discovered here: \nthat it is possible that autism-associated language differences may be a \nconsequence from primary-social mechanisms [Rutter, 1983; see also \n(Boucher, 1976)]. Language continues to be studied in autism, but not \nas a primary cause of a wide range of symptoms (Iverson and Goldin-\nMeadow, 2005; Landa and Goldberg, 2005; Eigsti et al., 2011; Luyster \net al., 2011). If anything, language features of autism have in the last few \ndecades been treated as explananda (“those things which must \nbe explained, ” i.e., the causal outcome of other factors) of Theory of \nMind, Executive Function and Weak Central Coherence causal theories.\nOur second substantive conclusion revolves around the estimate \nof a factor statistically comprised of a joint variance space inherited \nfrom Imaginative Play, Non-Verbal Communication, and Verbal \nLanguage, and one which also correlates with Social Withdrawal and \nRRB. Although the results from Model 4 negate the original directional \nclaims in Models 1–3, nevertheless we still have statistical evidence for \nthe existence of such a factor. Because of its association with RRB \n(albeit a small one), we are closer to the truth if we follow Hermelin \nand O’Connor by labeling it “Coding” rather than “Symbolism. ” (Here, \ntoo, Rutter changed his position (Rutter, 1983).) However, without a \ndirect test of coding [e.g., as measured experimentally by Hermelin \nand O'Connor (1970) ], we  still cannot assign this label with any \nconfidence. Nevertheless, the presence of this statistically defined \nconstruct and its relationship to social withdrawal and RRB gives us \nan affordance for further hypothesizing and testing. There are more \ntrivial possibilities represented by this joint variance space: that it \nreflects general task engagement [e.g., Rimland, 1964 as a claim of \nunderarousal and under-engagement] or reporting bias associated \nwith the questionnaire methodology (anecdotally discussed among \npsychometricians). Using diverse methods of measurement reduces \nthe susceptibility to such biases and confounds, which could either \nover-or under-inflate estimates of relationships between constructs. \nThe advantage of a theoretically informed approach over a purely \nempirical approach is that theoretical constructs are defined in such a \nway as to allow fusion of data from multiple modalities, participant \nsamples and experimental designs, each with differential sensitivity to \nartifact ( Cronbach and Meehl, 1955 ; Andreas, 2017 ; Pearl and \nBareinboim, 2018; Ewen et al., 2021).\nA further possibility with regard to our empirically estimated \n“Coding” variable is that it reflects a summary quantitative autism trait \n(Constantino, 2011), though we view this possibility as being less \nlikely because it has only a modest correlation with diagnostically \nessential RRB features. We  acknowledge that within other \npsychological and cognitive neuroscientific study of psychiatric \nconditions, statistical adjustment for a condition-specific “generalized \nneurocognitive impairment” explained the bulk of variance in clinical \nperformance and reduces statistical associations between individual \nconstructs (Reilly and Sweeney, 2014; Reilly et al., 2017); these results \nfrom other conditions are consistent with empirical evidence of a \nunidimensional, quantitative autism trait (Constantino, 2011; though \nsee empirical results supporting a competing model ( Happé et al., \n2006; Happé and Ronald, 2008 ; Robinson et al., 2012 )). However, \ngiven the rather modest correlation between some features (e.g., \n“Symbolism” and RRB), it would appear that the effects we  are \nconsidering here correspond to the inter-individual heterogeneity \nConstantino and colleagues refer to as “sitting on top of the \nsubstructure” reflected by the core, unidimensional, quantitative \nautism trait (Constantino et al., 2021).\nWe should note that the theories as stated in the original literature \nalso included additional elements for which our convenience sample \ndid not have items, including the distinction between receptive vs. \nexpressive language, and pragmatic language usage. With more richly \nspecified models, constructs parsed to an optimal level of granularity, \nand specific measures, we  can provide models that have a wider \nexplanatory scope, more effectively avoid circularity and are more \namenable to falsification.\nSubstantive conclusions about age and \nrole of development\nWe saw no substantial evidence of a moderating effect of Age in any \nof our models. Models 1 and 4 are “developmental” in the sense that \nTang et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1060525\nFrontiers in Psychology 14 frontiersin.org\nperformance of an ability at a certain level, in a way that interacts with the \nenvironment, leads to changes in another ability (e.g., social withdrawal \ncauses an alteration in the typical environmental-dependent learning of \nlanguage). This form of causal influence manifests as a lag between \nobservable behavior from the causal cognitive construct and the \nconsequent observable performance of the downstream cognitive \nconstruct. If some intervention were to directly minimize a child’s social \nwithdrawal today, we would predict that the consequent expansion of \nlanguage abilities would be  measurable after a period of social \nengagement, language learning and language practice. The least \nambiguous way to measure this lag effect would be through collection and \nanalysis of longitudinal data. Longitudinal data incorporate temporal \nprecedence that makes the conclusion of causality more dependent on the \nstructure of the data and less dependent on model assumptions.\nHowever, even in this cross-sectional dataset, we did not find \nevidence of Age moderation with a relevant effect size in any of \nanalyzes. If our theories entail a lag between the manifestation of the \ncause and the manifestation of the effect, then we would predict the \npresence of a substantial interaction effect, which we did not find.\nOur results are further susceptible to the possibility of critical \nperiods, viz., that our data collection did not occur over the age range \nat which irreversible developmental effects occur. Rutter specifically \ndenied that critical periods were relevant to his theoretical accounts \n(Rutter, 1968), however research since that time has endorsed the \nrelevance of critical periods to development; in the case of autism \nspecifically, early intervention appears to have the best chance at \nenhancing adaptive outcomes (Tonge et al., 2014).\nSampling and diagnostic moderation \neffects\nAs noted earlier, descriptive effects mis-labeled as causal claims \nare subject to fallacious circular reasoning (e.g., the fact that autistic \nindividuals have differences in language serves as evidence that \nlanguage differences cause autism…which in turn is characterized in \npart by language differences; Morton, 2005). This circularity highlights \nthe inferential challenges associated with deriving causal evidence \nfrom case–control data, particularly where case status is defined by \nheterogeneous categorical psychiatric diagnoses [e.g., via the \nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder (DSM) \n(American Psychiatric Association, 2013 )]. Moreover, as the \nheterogeneity of the autism spectrum (Wing, 1988b) or constellation \n(Fletcher-Watson and Happé, 2019) is possibly expanding due to \nchanging diagnostic thresholds ( Wing, 1976b), we  recognize that \nindividuals can meet diagnostic criteria for autism through a variety \nof symptom patterns (DeMyer et al., 1971; Wing and Gould, 1979; \nWing, 1988a). To wit, autism diagnosis was treated as a proxy for \nsocial withdrawal by the authors whose theories motivated our \nanalyzes, whereas we now recognize that not all autistic individuals \ndemonstrate social withdrawal (Wing and Gould, 1979). For those \nreasons, our primary approach was within-group (ASD-Only \nanalyzes), using targeted behavioral explananda (e.g., language \ndifferences cause social withdrawal) rather than diagnostic explananda \n(e.g., language differences cause autism). Moreover, we have far greater \nstatistical power when we quantify each individual’s expression of a \nparticular behavioral explanandum rather than lumping together \nindividuals who show high levels of that feature with those who do not.\nNevertheless, even making the explanandum as focused as \npossible still leaves statistical conclusions and subsequent inference \nsensitive to biases and confounds associated with suboptimal \nsampling. The theories we have evaluated were developed within a \nconception of autism that included language differences as an essential \ncriterion, and the SPARK data were sampled under a more inclusive \ndiagnostic framework. We  contended with known and suspected \nlanguage and IQ differences between the sample and the theoretical \npopulation by evaluating the moderating effect of General Intelligence \nand DLD diagnosis (both of which showed a small effect sizes in all \nanalyzes), but there may be other, unmeasured differences between \nindividuals Rutter and Hermelin studied and those sampled in the \ncurrent diagnostic era.\nFuture efforts to study feature-to-feature, rather than feature-to-\ndiagnosis associations, while “ignoring” the remainder of the \n(non-independently distributed) patient characteristics that contribute \na DSM syndromic diagnosis, has limitations. Within these sparse \nmodels, failing to account for all other cognitive and behavioral \nfeatures of a syndrome leads to a substantial risk of confounding by \nthose features. For that reason, we also evaluated an ASD + Sibs cohort \nand specifically accounted for diagnostic interaction effects within \nthat cohort. We viewed the presence of a diagnostic moderation effect \nas representing a placeholder, not unlike dark matter, for effects that \nwere only indirectly observed and not explicitly modeled. In Models \n1 and 2, this diagnostic interaction term explained 7–13 percentage \npoints of the variance in the targeted relationships. In future work, \nwe may see how much of the diagnostic interaction term is explained \naway by a unidimensional, latent quantitative autism trait \n(Constantino, 2011). However, the assessment of a latent autism trait \nis only meaningful when a sufficiently broad scope of autistic features \nis sampled.\nSampling approaches are also highly relevant to ensuring that data \nare representative as a whole, and the Simons Foundation is taking \nproactive steps to increase diversity within the SPARK sample (Duhon \net al., 2022).\nThe literature in the 1960’s and 1970’s was heavily invested in \nthe extensive use of alternate clinical control groups for focusing in \non how autism may be similar or different to those other conditions \n(Yule, 1978). Autism was the relatively new diagnosis, and far more \nwas known at the time about the psychology of sensory \nimpairments, DLD and ID. As autism research developed its own \nmomentum, much of the work proceeded over subsequent decades \nin a case–control mode. Skip ahead to recent times and increasing \ncalls for “reversion” to trans-diagnostic approaches ( Happé and \nFrith, 2006 ; Constantino et al., 2021 ). Trans-diagnostic research is \nparticularly critical in autism research, as which many of the \nconditions on the differential diagnosis list are also highly \nco-occurring with ASD. Rather than trapping ourselves in a \nsituation where we force ourselves to attribute a behavior either to \nautism or to co-occurring Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder \n(ADHD) (e.g., as an independent variable within a case–control \nstudy), we can merely quantify the behavioral explanandum and \nevaluate its association with a particular mechanism. By formalizing \nand statistically evaluating causal models with behavioral (rather \nthan diagnostic-category) explananda, we may in this way sample \nfrom multiple current-day diagnoses and conjointly model \nbehavioral explanantia and proposed mechanisms that are relevant \nto one or both diagnoses ( Harris, 2016).\nTang et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1060525\nFrontiers in Psychology 15 frontiersin.org\nWithin the 1980’s to early 2000’s Developmental Psychology era \nof autism research, which was focused on the relationship among \nExecutive Function, Weak Central Coherence and Theory of Mind \naccounts of autism, the field paid considerable attention to whether \ncertain cognitive differences (somewhat arbitrarily thresholded and \nbinarized) were uniquely and universally present (only) in autistic \nindividuals (whose diagnostic status is itself some sort of semi-\narbitrary binarization of multidimensional behavioral characteristics; \nRajendran and Mitchell, 2007). The approach used here, by contrast, \nfocuses not on binary-binary associations of mechanism and \ndiagnosis, but on continuous-continuous relationships of cognitive \nmechanism and behavioral explanandum, effectively dissolving \nquestions of uniqueness/universality and replacing them with \nquantitative expressions of how much a certain mechanism contributes \nto a certain behavior.\nAgain, DSM diagnosis cannot be completely ignored however, \nboth because of the potential confounds of non-independently-\ndistributed, unmodeled features of the syndrome, but also because \nof practical considerations around participant recruitment. DSM \ndiagnoses provide a method of identification for study recruitment, \nand the trans-diagnostic approach supported here and by others \n(Happé and Frith, 2006 ; Constantino et  al., 2021 ) requires \nrecruitment of multiple diagnoses. Conditions that mimic autism, \nshare at least some behavioral features, co-occur at higher-than-\npopulation rates ( Ewen and Shapiro, 2005 ) or provide important \ncontrasts include DLD, ID, ADHD plus language delay, anxiety plus \nlanguage delay, Sensory Processing Disorder (without other \ndiagnostic aspects of the autism phenotype), selective mutism, \nsocial anxiety, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, stereotypic \nmovement disorder, “quirky” phenotypes, shyness, introversion, \nchronic distraction (e.g., from chronic pain), Social (Pragmatic) \nCommunication Disorder (i.e., without RRB), isolated \ndevelopmental prosopagnosia, isolated alexithymia, sensory \nimpairment, Developmental Coordination Disorder/dyspraxia, \nepilepsy (social features), TBI (social features), the now-defunct \nNon-Verbal Learning Disorder, features of Frontal-Temporal \nDementia, psychotic disorders, Major Depressive Disorder, \nAdjustment Disorder, Tourette Syndrome, and Schizoid/Schizotypal \nPersonality Disorder. We can also enhance the generalizability of \nour understanding by increasing the diversity of our autism and \nneurotypical samples, particularly over ever-evolving diagnostic \ncriteria and thresholds ( Rosen et al., 2021 ). We may study different \nlevels of severity, intermediate phenotypes ( DeMyer et al., 1971 ; \nWing, 1976b; Rutter, 1978; Landa et al., 1991 , 1992; Pickles et al., \n2000; Dawson et  al., 2002 ), syndromic and non-syndromic \netiologies, and different behavioral presentations within ASD ( Wing \nand Gould, 1979 ; Wing, 1988a ; Mottron and Bzdok, 2020 ) data-\ndriven methods of hierarchically modeling clinical features across \nthe neurodiversity spectrum ( Clementz et al., 2016 ; Jacobs et al., \n2021; Scheerer et al., 2022 ). Such trans-diagnostic work is already \npaying dividends at the genetic level ( Lord et al., 2020 ) and may \nagain do so at the cognitive level.\nIn the future, we may also define our “diagnostic” moderation \nterms not based on current behavioral syndromes, such as those \ndefined by DSM, but by empirically derived clusters derived from data \nat different levels of analysis, such as the genetic level (Torres, 2021), \nthe “imaging” level (Clementz et al., 2016) or via modern artificial \nintelligence approaches that capture delimited clusters of behavioral \nperformance (Mottron and Bzdok, 2020). Trans-diagnostic clustering \nbased on fine-granularity cognitive research as well as data from other \nlevels of analysis may redefine our nosologies (Ewen et al., 2021).\nIn summary, both fully categorical (e.g., DSM diagnoses) and fully \ndimensional (quantitative behavioral explananda) approaches have \ntheir limitations. However, we  can discard the notion that “the \ncomplex and heterogeneous ASD phenotype will be explained by a \nperfectly unique and universal cognitive cause” by modeling multiple \ncandidate mechanisms conjointly, consistent with the approach of \nso-called Multiple Deficit accounts of autism (Wing and Wing, 1971; \nGoodman, 1989 ; Happé and Ronald, 2008 ; Boucher, 2011b). By \nstudying a diverse range of the autism spectrum as well as current \ndiagnoses that show some overlapping features, we will be able to \nassess the magnitude of contribution of a diversity of mechanisms, \nsome related to only one existing diagnosis, and others relevant \nto multiple.\nGenerating and refining theories\nTo this point, we have talked about the evaluation of theories. But \nwhat constraints exist in the development of theories and their \nexplication? Keeping theories as the center of our efforts is important \nnot just to raise the bar on statistical tests, but because theory is our \nprimary unit of scientific understanding. Theory is what allows us to \nlink, for example, language as measured by a psychoeducational test \nwith language as expressed in academic performance with language \nas employed in social interactions ( Cronbach and Meehl, 1955 ; \nAndreas, 2017). And it also allows us to constrain the relationships \nwe enter into our theories and causal graphs (e.g., it is meaningful to \ntalk about an alteration in symbolic function causing a difference in \nlanguage function but not the reverse relationship, as symbolic \ncognition must logically precede its expression via language). That is \nto say that the theories investigators propose in the first instance are \nnaturally bound by existing knowledge from a wide variety of sources \n(van Rooij and Baggio, 2021). In the case of autism, novel theorizing \nwas in many instances explicitly guided by existing knowledge around \ntypical language development, DLD, sensory impairments and \nID. That is to say that theorizing about autism is constrained from the \nstart by existing knowledge outside the realm of autism research. \nWriting about the philosophy of science as related to physics, Nagel \n(Nagel, 1979), posed each theory of a specific phenomenon (e.g., the \nbehavioral phenotype of autism) as a “sub-theory” of a unified theory \naddressing all phenomena within a broader scientific discipline (e.g., \nDevelopmental Psychology or Cognitive Psychology).\nSo, the notion of conjointly modeling theories of multiple current \ndiagnoses and sampling from those populations is not only of practical \nvalue but is also important in developing the “grand” model of a \nparticular subfield of psychology that would explain variance across \n“typical development” as well as all relevant clinical conditions. Within \nthe current work, we have seen examples of different ways in which \ndistinct theoretical accounts can relate to each other. Two theories \nmay be mutually exclusive (e.g., social withdrawal→language vs. social \nwithdrawal←language), one may supervene on another (e.g., coding \nexplains the phenomena attributed to symbolism, and also explains \nRRB while symbolism alone does not), they may explain different \nexplananda, or they may both contribute (additively or supra-\nadditively) to the same explanandum.\nIn order to model theories conjointly, we first need to explicate \ntheories well. The theories formalized here as causal statistical graphs \nTang et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1060525\nFrontiers in Psychology 16 frontiersin.org\nwere “verbal” and “imprecise” (Fried, 2020). The lax specification of \ntheories has been a significant hinderance to theory-evaluating work \n(Morton, 2005). Computational models, again gaining popularity \n(Devezer et al., 2021; van Rooij and Baggio, 2021), may contribute to \nformalization of theories, but even verbally-stated theories can be held \nto the standard of providing precise predictions and explicating their \nareas of divergence from other accounts (Fried, 2020). In the work \npresented here, we found that reading the evolution of the literature \nover decades, particularly as the various authors responded to each \nother, helped add specificity to models that may not have been present \nin a lax summary of claims, handed down through a “game \nof telephone. ”\nHowever, even after theories are formalized, it may not be trivial \nto model one conjointly with another. Autism research has attracted \ninvestigators from a wide range of disciplines/subfields of \npsychological science—Kraepalin Psychiatry, Psychoanalysis, Clinical \nNeurology, Behavioral Psychology, Cognitive Psychology, \nNeuropsychology/Behavioral Neurology, Piagetian and Connectivist \nDevelopmental Psychology, Cognitive Neuroscience, and, more \nrecently, computational approaches to psychology, such as Predictive \nCoding and Computational Motor Control—each with its own \nvocabulary, set of constructs (ontology) and premises. Bringing these \nconstructs and frameworks in alignment in a way that can be put to \nempirical testing is non-trivial and has been the effort of both formal \n(Westmeyer, 1989) and informal (Allport, 1955) types of efforts within \npsychology broadly. Perhaps the time is ripe for such an effort within \nautism research.\nConclusion\nWe present evidence against the language-primary theory of \nautism in the form originally proposed by Rutter. Our results support \n(or fail to falsify) primary-social theories (Richter, 1978) or subsequent \naccounts which hold a primary role for non-verbal communication \n(Mundy et al., 1986). We also provide evidence for a construct defined \nstatistically as the shared variance space of Verbal Language, \nNon-Verbal Communication and Imaginative Play; this construct also \ncorrelates with Social Withdrawal and RRB. It has the statistical \nfeatures predicted by Hermelin and O’Connor’s coding construct, but \nwithout a direct test of coding ability, it is impossible to know whether \nthat is what it is.\nThis “test flight” of using large datasets and network analyzes to \ntest theory has also highlighted principles for a broader research \nagenda. First is the principle of specification (and constraint) of our \nanalyzes a priori ; this is accomplished in the first instance by \nformalizing theories ( Morton, 2005 ) as directed graphs, and \nassessing the pre-existing observations and assumptions on which \nthe theory was based ( van Rooij and Baggio, 2021 ), whether \ninherited from autism research or from other domains of \npsychological research. We  further constrain the graphs by \nincluding as many constructs as warranted ( Peirce, 1960 ; \nRosenbaum, 2017 ); the greater the number of predicted \nrelationships, the easier to falsify or test competitively with other \ntheories. Measurement of constructs though multiple methods \n(Ewen et  al., 2021 ) and with adequate controls helps eliminate \nsensitivity to artifacts that can either over-or under-estimate \nstatistical relationships; the use of theoretical constructs within \ngraphs rather than solely observable variables allows us to fuse \ninformation from multiple modalities ( Cronbach and Meehl, 1955; \nAndreas, 2017 ; Pearl and Bareinboim, 2018 ). Longitudinal data \nfurther help constrain interpretation in developmental contexts.\nThe second principle is quantification. The reliance on \nbinarization—of presence/absence of diagnosis, of presence/\nabsence of a “candidate cause” cognitive difference—has led to \nconcerns about whether a single cognitive difference is both \nnecessary and sufficient to explain the rich and heterogeneous \nbehavioral phenotype of autism. However, considering the weighted \ncontribution of explanatory mechanisms to explananda dissolves \nthese concerns, particularly where we  suspect that there may \nbe  multiple mechanisms working in parallel or in interactive \nfashion (Goodman, 1989 ; Happé et al., 2006 ). Also, quantification \nof behavioral features (rather than contrasting results over multiple \ncase–control studies, in which diagnosis serves as the \nexplanandum), renders results more resistant to changing \ndefinitions of autism and to sampling biases.\nThe third principle is integration, across existing diagnoses \n(Happé et al., 2006 ; Happé and Ronald, 2008 ) and across theories \n(theories about autism and theories about other diagnostic groups). \nBy focusing on behavioral (rather than diagnostic/syndromic) \nexplananda, we can model together data from multiple conditions \nthat have some relevance to autism. Testing in integrative fashion, \nwe define whether different theories relate to each other as additive/\nsuper-additive contributors to the same explanandum, as parallel \ncontributors to different explananda, in supervenience or are truly \nmutually exclusivity. To do so well, we must be aware of the need \nfor formal explication of theories (and their predictions), as well as \nchallenges inherent in integrating theories across psychological \ndisciplines. But in achieving this integration, we begin to build up \nmodels that span typical and diverse development and inter-\nindividual differences in performance. Recent works bringing \ntogether multiple theories of autism in one place are tremendously \nhelpful in integrating theories ( Rajendran and Mitchell, 2007 ; \nFletcher-Watson and Happé, 2019).\nWe are conscious that the approaches suggested here will \ninherently require very large samples. However, smaller-scale but \nmore directed data collection will also be  an important part of \ndefining particular relationships that are important for constraining \nour models.\nWhat is the end-goal of this program of research? One of the \nauthors (JBE) is a Neurodevelopmental Disabilities physician, \nand the key cognitive task in clinic with complex patients is to \ncreate a mental model effectively equivalent to those studied here,  \nwhich relates multiple cognitive factors to multiple behavioral \nfeatures to participation in the community. With an adequate \nmental model, the clinician can most efficiently and effectively \npropose interventions (clinical or environmental; Woodward, \n2003) that will alleviate points of friction that affect adaptive \nfunction and quality of life. In so far as any disability reflects a \nmismatch among an individual’s cognitive profile, social supports \nand social expectations, we are conscious of the fact that the most \napt explananda, which are causally downstream even of behavior, \nmay be these functional (community participation) and quality-\nof-life outcomes.\nTang et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1060525\nFrontiers in Psychology 17 frontiersin.org\nData availability statement\nPublicly available datasets were analyzed in this study.
