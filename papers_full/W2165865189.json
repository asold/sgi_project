Seaweeds contain\nunique, hydrocolloid polysaccharide components such as\nalginate and carageenan that are used in many different food\napplications, but seaweeds are also a source of potentially\nbioactive polysaccharides, with fucoidans from brown sea-\nweeds currently being the most intensely studied type of these\ncompounds.\nFucoidans in fact designate a group of fucose-rich, sulfated\npolysaccharides, usually built of a backbone of a-linked L-\nfucose residues having various substitutions. Fucoidan poly-\nsaccharides are mainly found in brown seaweeds, but\nfucoidans differ in structure among brown seaweed species.\nChemically, fucoidans cover several different structural enti-\nties that designate a family of fucose-containing sulfated\npolysaccharides (FCSPs). 1 While FCSPs comprise many differ-\nent types of fucose-rich polysaccharide structures, including\nsulfated fucogalacturonans found in e.g. Sargassumsp., we will\nin the present treatise use the terms fucoidan and fucoidan\npolysaccharides exclusively for structural polysaccharide com-\nponents from brown seaweeds that have a backbone of a-L-\nfucopyranose residues. Fucoidan polysaccharides exhibit a\nnumber of pharmaceutically interesting biological activities,\nincluding immuno-modulatory, anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory\nand anti-coagulant effects (to be discussed in more detail\nlater). The bioactivities of fucoidans are related to their\nstructural make-up, monosaccharide composition, sulfate\ncontent, position of sulfate ester groups, and molecular\nweight.2 Mild extraction technology is essential for maintain-\ning the structural integrity of the fucoidan polysaccharides and\nfor preserving their biological properties.\nClassical extraction of fucoidans from brown seaweeds\ninvolves multi-step extended aqueous extractions, usually with\nhot acid (hydrochloric acid), 3 and may include calcium\naddition to promote alginate precipitation during purifica-\ntion,3,4 but no standardized purification procedure is available\nfor fucoidans at present. Distinct structures can be isolated by\ndifferent extraction conditions. 2,5 It has recently been demon-\nstrated that fucoidans are vulnerable to harsh extraction\nconditions and that the extraction method significantly\ninfluences the yields and not least the polysaccharide\ncomposition of the extracted fucose-containing sulfated\npolysaccharides.3 In addition, the heterogeneity of the\nstructural make-up of seaweeds within the same species may\nlead to pronounced differences in the products extracted. The\nproblem of elucidating the structural details of fucoidans has\nbeen exacerbated by the use of many different extraction\ntechniques. There is therefore an urgent demand for more\nwell-defined, gentle extraction techniques, employing shor-\ntened extraction times, lower temperatures, and lower acid\nCenter for Bioprocess Engineering, Department of Chemical and Biochemical\nEngineering, Technical University of Denmark (DTU), Building 229, DK-2800 Lyngby,\nDenmark.

For industrial manufacturing, in addition to being\nconsistent, the extraction technique must be cost-effective and\neco-friendly, and of course abide appropriate legal require-\nments regarding solvent use.\nThis review provides an overview of the structural traits of\nfucoidans, highlights the extraction technologies used for\nobtaining fucoidans from brown seaweeds, and discusses the\ninfluence of extraction parameters on the yield and composi-\ntional attributes of fucoidan polysaccharides. Newer findings\nregarding fucoidan-modifying enzymes are discussed in\nrelation to their action on fucoidans and their use in\nelucidating native fucoidan structures. Lastly, the potential\nbioactivities and possible applications of fucoidans are high-\nlighted.\n2 Structures and chemical nature of\nfucoidans\nFucoidans from brown seaweed algae generally consist of a\nbackbone of a(1A3)-L-fucopyranose residues or of alternating\na(1A3) and a(1A4)-linked L-fucopyranosyls, which in either\ncase may be substituted with sulfate or acetate and/or have\nside branches containing fucopyranoses or other glycosyl\nunits, e.g. glucuronic acid. Several of the fucoidan structures\nreported in the literature have also contained small amounts\nof various other monosaccharides e.g. glucose, galactose,\nxylose, and/or mannose.\n1 These monosaccharides may repre-\nsent contamination with other polysaccharides or may in fact\nbe genuine substitutions on the fucoidan molecular entities.\nThe fucoidans in brown seaweeds in the order of Fucales,\ne.g. Fucus evanescensand Fucus serratus, represent the typical\nstructures: They possess a large proportion of both a(1A3)-\nand a(1A4)-linked\nL-fucopyranose residues, which may be\nsubstituted with sulfate (SO 3\n2) on C-2 and C-4 (Table 1). 6,7,10\nAnother typical fucoidan structure is found in fucoidans\nisolated from the alga Ascophyllum nodosum (Fucales). These\nfucoidan molecules have a backbone consisting of a repeating\nstructure of a(1A3)-linked\nL-fucopyranose residues with\nsulfate at the C-2 position, with the a(1A3)-linked L-\nfucopyranose residues linked to a(1A4)-L-fucopyranose resi-\ndues with disulfate at C-2 and C-3 (Table 1). The same\nstructural elements are also found in fucoidans extracted from\nF. vesiculosus.\n9\nIn contrast, the sulfated ‘‘pseudo’’-fucoidan polysacchar-\nides extracted from some other species in the order Fucales,\nsuch as e.g. Sargassum stenophyllum , are built mainly of\nb(1A6)-\nD-galactose and/or b(1A2)-D-mannose units in the\npolysaccharide backbone with branching points formed by\na(1A3) and/or a(1A4)-\nL-fucose, a(1A4)-D-glucuronic acid,\nterminal b-D-xylose, and sometimes a(1A4)-D-glucose. The\nsulfate groups on the fucans are typically located at C-4 of a\n(1A3)-linked unit or on C-2 of a (1 A4)-linked residue.\n11\nSeveral fucoidan structures extracted from brown seaweed\nspecies of the order of Laminariales have been reported to\ncontain structural elements that mainly consist of a backbone\nof a(1A3)-linked L-fucopyranose residues with sulfates at the\nC-2 position. 12,13 Fucoidans isolated from L. saccharina\n(Laminariales) are thus mainly composed of a(1A3)-linked L-\nfucopyranose units, but with sulfate at both C-2 and C-4, or at\nC-4 alone, however (Table 1). These structural units are similar\nto those found in the fucoidans from Chorda filum\n(Laminariales) which consist of a core backbone structure of\npoly-a(1A3)-linked L-fucopyranoses sulfated mainly at C-4,\nsometimes at the C-2 position, and with some of the a(1A3)-\nlinked fucose residues being 2- O-acetylated.\n4,14 Similarly, the\nfucoidans from Cladosiphon okamuranus (Chordariales) are\nbasically made up of linear backbones of a(1A3)-linked L-\nfucopyranose residues (Table 1) with a portion of the fucose\nresidues being O-acetylated and with some sulfate substitution\nat the C-4 position. 8\nSulfated b-D-galactan has been isolated in trace amounts\nfrom Laminaria angustataand these polysaccharides have also\nbeen classified as fucoidans, eventhough b-D-galactose appear\nto be the major sugar, and L-fucose and D-glucuronic acid are\npresent only as trace components. 15\nBy use of advanced analytical technology more recent\nstudies have verified that fucoidans from brown seaweeds in\nthe order of Fucales such as F. evanescens and F. serratus do\nindeed contain large proportions of both a(1A3) and a(1A4)\nglycosidic bonds.\n6,7,10 Therefore the initial suggestion that\nfucoidan obtained from F. vesiculosus (Fucales) was built of\na(1A2) linked L-fucopyranosyl has been revised. 16 More\ndetailed analysis of F. evanescens by MALDI-TOF and tandem\nESI mass spectrometry has also revealed the presence of minor\ncomponents such as mixed mono-sulfated fucooligosacchar-\nides containing both 2- O- and 4- O-sulfated (1 A4) bonded\nxylose and galactose residues: Xyl-(1 A4)-Fuc, Gal-(1 A4)-Fuc,\nGal-(1A4)-Gal-(1A4)-Fuc, Gal-(1 A4)-Gal. Glucuronic acid\n(GlcA) has also been detected and found to be an integral\npart of the non-sulfated fucooligosaccharides: Fuc-(1 A3)-GlcA,\nFuc-(1A4)-Fuc-(1A3)-GlcA, Fuc-(1 A3)-Fuc-(1A3)-GlcA respec-\ntively.\n13\nThe variations in the reported structural properties of\nfucoidans from different brown seaweed species clearly\nconfirm the natural biodiversity of fucoidans as exemplified\nby the structures found in different seaweed taxonomical\norders, notably Fucales, Laminariales and Chordariales\n(Table 1). It also seems clear that fucoidans extracted from\nbrown seaweeds under the same seaweed classification ( i.e.\norder) have different composition, and in turn that the\nstructural traits cannot be categorized or predicted according\nto algal order as also indicated in Table 2.\nHence, the published structural data for algal fucoidans\nconfirm that there is no consistent basic structure of\n‘‘fucoidan’’.\nDespite the relatively large variations in the compositional\nand structural properties of fucoidans obtained from different\nbrown seaweed species, it appears that primarily the (1 A3)-\nlinked a-\nL-fucopyranosyl backbone structure, and secondly the\nbackbone structure composed of alternating a(1A3) and\n8132 | RSC Adv., 2013, 3, 8131–8141 This journal is /C223The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013\nReview RSC Advances\nOpen Access Article.

He also observed that the fucose occurred together\nwith mannitol, alginic acid and laminarin; we now know that\nthis interpretation was a result of co-extraction of these latter\ncontaminants with the fucoidan polysaccharides. After two\nyears of rigorous investigation, Kylin (1915) reported that\nfucoidan isolated from Laminaria digitata contained methyl-\npentose, interpreted as\nL-fucose, as well as some other\npentoses (Table 3). 21 Nelson and Cretcher (1931) 22 used\nMacrocystis pyrifera as a fucoidan source, and employed\nrepeated, extended (48 h) extractions with dilute HCl followed\nby isolation of the fucoidan polysaccharides by ethanol\nprecipitation (Table 3). Nelson and Cretcher 22 revealed the\npresence of sulfate in the form of ester groupings in the\nprecipitated product and also confirmed that fucose was the\nonly sugar present in the unhydrolyzed seaweed residue after\nacid hydrolysis-despite their product containing uronic acid\n(Table 3), which was considered to be due to alginate\ncontamination. Alginate or alginic acid is composed of\nguluronic and mannuronic acids. In the past, these mono-\nmeric acid saccharides have been determined together as\nuronic acids, which cover several different structures, however.\nThe presence of alginate (as a contaminant) in fucoidan\npolysaccharide extracts has caused some confusion in the\nTable 2Chemical composition of the different order of brown seaweed species produced using different extraction methods1\nSpecies Order Extraction Method Composition Reference\nCladosiphon\nokamuranus\nChordariales Seaweed-H 2O suspension was\ntreated with 30% HCl (pH 3)\nat 100 uC for 15 min.

The extracted fucoidan specimen was found to\ncontain 33–37% methylpentose (correctly interpreted as\nfucose), and the total sulfate estimated in the polysaccharide\nwas 35–38% by weight. Later, boiling water was used to extract\nfucoidan polysaccharide fractions from Fucus vesiculosus ,\nFucus spirales, Himanthalia lorea and Laminaria clustoni by\nusing 24 h extraction; and alginates and protein were removed\nwith lead acetate and addition of barium hydroxide (Table 3).\nThe resulting lead-hydroxide-fucoidan complex was then\ndecomposed with dilute sulphuric acid, and the fucoidan\nmolecules were isolated after prolonged hydrolysis and\nfiltration.\n25 The product from Himanthalia lorea was consid-\nered the purest fucoidan specimen since it contained\nsubstantial amounts of fucose and sulfate. Still, small\nquantities of uronic acid, galactose and xylose were found.\nThe ash was mainly composed of calcium sulfate.\nFucoidan production at the larger lab scale was done in the\nearly 1950s to obtain larger quantities of fucoidans.\n27 The\nfucoidan extraction procedure was optimized by using one\npart by weight of dried ground seaweed and 10 parts by\nvolume of 0.1 M HCl at pH 2.0–2.5 contacted at 70 uC with\nconstant stirring for 1 h.\n27 A single acid hydrolysis extraction\ntreatment using this method recovered about 50% by weight\n(w/w) of the theoretical maximum of the fucoidan polysacchar-\nides (recovered yield measured as % fucose obtained of total\nfucose present in the seaweed dry weight), whereas three\nrounds of the acid extraction recovered more than 80% of the\nfucose present; the triple acid hydrolysis treatment (0.1 M HCl,\npH 2.0–2.5, 70 uC, 1 h 6 3) was therefore selected as the\noptimal extraction method. After the acid hydrolysis treatment\nthe crude fucoidan polysaccharides were isolated by fractional\nprecipitation with alcohol and further purified by precipitation\nafter addition of formaldehyde. By this procedure, samples of\ncrude fucoidans containing 30–36% fucose were obtained; for\nexample, the fucoidan polysaccharides recovered from F.\nvesiculosus using this optimal extraction protocol was analyzed\nto contain (by weight) 44% fucose; 26% total sulfate, and 31%\nash. Fucoidan yield was calculated as % fucose of total fucose\npresent in the seaweed raw material and the results obtained\nfor the four different algal species were: Pelvetia canaliculata\n76%; F. vesiculosus 62%; Ascophyllum nodusum 54%, and L.\ncloustoni 20%.\n27 The triple-step HCl extraction procedure 27\nappears to be the one being used for the laboratory grade\nfucoidan product supplied by Sigma-Aldrich. However, already\nin the original report it was suggested that higher fucose yields\nmight be achieved by increasing the solvent/seaweed ratio,\nextraction time or number of extractions.\nThe classical treatment with dilute acid at ambient or\nslightly elevated temperature is still a preferred first step in\nextraction protocols for isolating fucoidan from different types\nof brown seaweeds prior to any fractionation and purification\nprocess.\n3 Transformation of alginate in the residual biomass\nTable 3The development of fucoidan extraction methodology over the years (1913–1950s), and its influences on fucoidan polysaccharide composition from\ndifferent brown seaweed species.

The pretreatment\nstep involves contacting the seaweed with a mixture of\nmethanol, chloroform and water (Table 2), and helps to\neliminate low molecular components ( e.g. phenols);\n7 removal\nof protein can be facilitated using proteolytic enzymes. 28\nBased on an analysis of the extraction methods employed in\ndifferent studies, it has become clear that the use of different\nacids-or no acid at all- and differences in extraction time and\ntemperature during the extraction and purification treatments\nof fucoidans, have generated very diverse compositional\nresults and structural suggestions for fucoidan polysacchar-\nides\n1 (Tables 2 and 3).\nA study was conducted to elucidate the structural compo-\nnents of a sulfated heteropolysaccharide obtained from\nSargassum linifolium. The extraction was done using HCl at\npH 1.0 for 3 h at 80 uC; the extract was then neutralized with\naqueous sodium carbonate and precipitated with ethanol. 29\nThe resulting sulfated polysaccharide material was acid\nhydrolyzed and the structure was proposed to consist of a\nbackbone composed of glucuronic acid, mannose, and\ngalactose residues with partially sulfated side-chains com-\nposed of galactose, xylose and fucose residues.\n29 A similar\nbrown seaweed species, Sargassum stenophyllum , was also\nextracted for fucoidans using water (7% w/v), for 12 h-repeated\n36 (Table 2), but the resulting sulfated polysaccharide\nmaterial, termed ‘‘sargassan’’, was proposed to be built of\nglucuronic acid, mannose, and galactose residues with\npartially sulfated side-chains composed of galactose, xylose\nand fucose residues.\n11\n3.1 Influence of extraction parameters on fucoidan yield and\ncomposition\nThe available compositional data evidently indicate the large\nvariation in the composition of the fucoidan products\nobtained from different extraction methods. As already\nmentioned, the majority of extraction methods involve\nrepetitive extraction in acid ( i.e. HCl) at elevated temperature.\nTo assess the influence of the extraction parameters notably\nacid, reaction time, temperature and repeated extraction on\nthe yields and composition of the extracted fucoidan poly-\nsaccharides, we developed a single-step extraction procedure\nusing Sargassum henslowianumas a model brown seaweed.\n3 All\nextraction parameters had significant effects on the yields, i.e.\nthe fucose-containing sulfated polysaccharide yield, with the\ntemperature and time exerting positive effects, and the acid\nconcentration having a negative effect. A maximal fucoidan\nyield of y7% was achieved by the optimal extraction\nprocedure of: 0.03 M HCl, 90 uC, 4 h. Lower polysaccharide\nyield, but relatively higher fucose content was obtained with\nshorter extraction time.\nThe HPAEC-PAD analysis of the TFA hydrolysate of S.\nhenslowianum confirmed that fucose, galactose, and glucuro-\nnic acid were the major constituents of the extracted\npolysaccharides obtained by the optimized method.\n3 The\ncomposition agrees with the prevalent polysaccharide struc-\ntures known among the Sargassum species; hence, in the case\nof S. patens and S. stenophyllum\n30,31 fucose-containing ele-\nments have been found to contain a linear backbone built of\n(1A6)-b-D-galactose and/or (1 A2)-b-D-mannose units with\nbranched chains formed by (1 A3) and/or (1 A4)-a-L-fucose,\n(1A4)-a-D-glucuronic acid, terminal b-D-xylose and sometimes\n(1A4)-a-D-glucose.\nStructural integrity of the polysaccharide was best conserved\nat low acid treatment. The use of 0.2 M HCl apparently broke\nthe integrity of the polysaccharide molecules resulting in a\ndecline of fucose at elevated time and temperature.\n3 This\nindicated that the higher acid levels might have caused a\nloosening of the cell wall matrix allowing local penetration of\nthe acid into the fucoidan. It has also been shown by others\nthat longer extraction time at higher temperatures led to\nhigher polysaccharide yield with lower amounts of sulfate and\na higher proportion of glucuronic acid.\n11,17 Ponce et al.\n(2003)17 thus reported that longer extraction time led to\npoorer fucose content, whereas glucuronic acid increased\nwhile sulfate decreased with time, i.e., the sulfate content was\nhighest when glucuronic acid was lowest.\n17 We also noticed\nthis trend during the experimental extraction work on S.\nhenslowianum.3\nThe data demonstrate the vulnerability of fucoidan struc-\ntures to harsh extraction conditions and confirm that the\nextraction method significantly influences the yields and not\nleast the composition of the extracted polysaccharides.\nThe differences caused by differences in extraction meth-\nodologies obviously may have major bearings on the results\nwhen the fucoidan polysaccharide products are being evalu-\nated for biological activity.\nThe available published data, including our own findings,\nthus generally show that the term ‘‘fucoidan’’ has been used\nfor several chemical structures, and vice versa, that fucoidans\nis a term that covers a family of fucose-containing sulfated\npolysaccharides. It is therefore more correct to use the term\nfucose-containing sulfated polysaccharides (FCSPs) as a\ncollective name for these polysaccharides. Also, a consensus\nto employ defined extraction protocols for extraction of\nfucoidan polysaccharides, or at least an agreement among\nscientists in the field to always include a benchmark extraction\nprocedure in their studies, would help to advance the\nunderstanding of these intriguing fucose-rich seaweed sub-\nstances that exert unique bioactivities.\n4 Fucoidan modifying enzymes and their\nuse for structural elucidation of fucoidans\nEnzymes catalyzing partial cleavage of seaweed polysacchar-\nides, for instance fucoidanase and sulfatase, have been\nproposed to be useful tools for investigating the structural\nfeatures and biological activity–function relationship of\nfucoidan polysaccharides. A number of studies, some of them\noriginally initiated to study bacterial degradation of fucoidans\nhave identified endo- and exo-type hydrolysis of fucoidan\n8136 | RSC Adv., 2013, 3, 8131–8141 This journal is /C223The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013\nReview RSC Advances\nOpen Access Article.

During the last 10 years the enzymes have\nbeen used as an aid in investigating structural features of\nfucoidans.\n4.1 Fucoidan modifying enzymes\nEnzymes catalyzing modifications of fucoidan polysacchar-\nides, i.e. ‘‘fucoidanases’’, include: i) Fucoidanases, EC 3.2.1.44,\nwhich catalyze the endo-hydrolysis of (1 A2)-a-\nL-fucoside\nlinkages in fucoidans without release of sulfate, and ii) a-L-\nFucosidases, EC 3.2.1.51 which catalyze the hydrolytic release\nof\nL-fucose, via cleavage of a(1A3)-, a(1A4)- and possibly also\nof a(1A2)-O-fucosyl bonds in fucoidan oligosaccharides. The\nenzymatic cleaving pattern and the structures of the products\nobtained from various fucoidan seaweed sources by the action\nof different types of fucoidanases from different microorgan-\nisms are listed in Table 4 and illustrated in Fig. 1.\n32–38\nEnzyme-assisted extraction of fucoidan polysaccharides has\nrecently been proposed, 5 using enzymes that do not catalyze\nthe hydrolysis of the target fucoidan polysaccharides. Enzyme\nassisted extraction is a clean and green type of technology.\nHowever, as compared to the quite advanced stage of\ndevelopment of designed enzyme mixtures for hydrolysis of\ncomplex plant materials or heterogenous plant cell wall\npolysaccharides,\n39,40 only various crude, commercial enzyme\nmixtures, designed for plant material processing, have been\nused as hydrolysis aids for extraction of brown seaweed bio-\nfunctional polysaccharide fractions.\n5,41 On the other hand,\nfucoidanases have been intensely studied in relation to\nbacterial degradation of fucoidans and molecular structure\nelucidation of fucoidan polysaccharides.\n35,36,42 A study of the\nfucosidase action on fucoidan polysaccharides from Fucus\ndistichus has thus established that the native fucoidan\npolysaccharides contain blocks of acetylated and partially\nsulfated repeating units. 35 Likewise, the enzymatic treatment\nconfirmed that the main fucoidan structural unit from this\nbrown seaweed Fucus spp. consists of repeating di-saccharide\nunits of [ A3)-a-\nL-Fucp-(2,4di-SO3\n2)-(1A4)-a-L-Fucp-(2SO3\n2)-\n(1A].35\nThree different cleavage mechanisms for fucoidan polysac-\ncharides are principally known to date: a-L-fucosidase only\ncatalyses the cleavage the a-L-fucosyl linkages at the non-\nreducing termini, releasing fucose from the fucose-backbone\nstructure in fucoidans (Enzyme type 3, Fig. 1). For fucoida-\nnases there are two different types of mechanisms known: one\ntype of fucoidanase catalyses the cleavage of small, low\nmolecular weight oligosaccharides from the end of the\nfucoidan backbone chains while the other type of fucoidanase\ncatalyses the glycosidic bonds (both a(1A3)-, a(1A4)-bonds)\nin the fucose-back bone via random endo-type hydrolysis\n(Table 4).\n32–38 We have chosen to differentiate these two types\nof enzymatic endo-attack as type 1 for a(1A4) cleavage, and\ntype 2 for the a(1A3) cleavage (Table 4 and Fig. 1).\nFucoidanase activities were first detected in several different\nmarine microorganisms, including marine bacteria such as\nVibrio sp., Alteromonas sp., Pseudoalteromonas sp., and bacteria\nof the family Flavobacteriaceae.\n32,36,37,43 Twenty five strains of\nepiphytic marine bacteria obtained from brown seaweed and\n53 bacteria isolated from sea cucumber were also screened for\nTable 4Fucoidan structures from different brown seaweed sources catalysed by Fucoidanases obtained from different microorganisms and their mode of cleaving\npatterns.

Bacteria of the genera\nCytophaga and Alteromonas/Pseudoalteromonas exhibited the\nhighest fucoidanase activities. 36\nFucoidan structures of brown seaweeds from the orders\nFucales and Chordariales are known to differ from those of\nLaminariales.\n1 The L-fucopyranose backbone of the fucoidan\nextracted from A. nodosum and F. vesiculosus is connected by\nalternating a(1A3) and a(1A4) linkages with sulfate substi-\ntuted at the 2- and 3-position of the fucose residues while\nfucoidan of Chorda filumand Laminaria saccharinaconsist of a\npoly-a-(1A3)-fucopyranoside backbone with sulfate mainly at\nC-4 and sometimes at the C-2 position (Table 1). Fucoidanase\nfrom the marine bacterium Fucanobacter lyticus has shown to\nexhibit extracellular endo-fucoidanase degrading activity on\nfucoidan polysaccharides obtained from brown seaweed in the\norder of Laminariales but not Fucales and Chordariales\nindicating specificity of an endo-1,3-a-fucoidanase.\n44 Marine\nbacteria such as Fucophilus fucoidanolyticus are to a certain\nextent able to consume fucoidans of various structures and\napparently synthesize a number of fucoidan-degrading\nenzymes. At least one of them (intracellular fucoidanase)\nseems to have the ability to catalyse the splitting of 1,3-\na-glycosidic bonds and has also been demonstrated to express\ndeacetylase activity being effective on acetylated fucoidans\nfrom Cladosiphon okamuranus.\n33\nFrom the information available about enzymes able to\ncatalyse modification of fucoidans from brown seaweeds, it\nappears that these enzymes may have a broad spectrum of\nbiological roles and potential applications. As mentioned\nearlier, fucoidan polysaccharides and other FCSPs exhibit\nsignificant biological properties in vitro such as anti-prolif-\nerative activity on cancer cells. However, the exact structural\nelement(s) in the fucoidan molecules being responsible for\nthese potentially protective activities are still unidentified. In\nthis connection, the targeted use of fucoidanases might assist\nin determining the precise molecular structures accountable\nfor preventive bioactivity effects. Also, as proposed by\nHoltkamp et al. (2009)\n42 more knowledge about the fucoi-\ndan-degrading enzymes might help in the elucidation of\ndifferent fucoidan structures and could pave the way for use of\nthese enzymes in industrial processes.\n5 The prospects for seaweed\npolysaccharides from brown seaweeds\nFucoidan polysaccharides have been reported to have potential\nbeneficial bioactive functions, including anti-proliferative\neffects on certain types of cancer cells. 45 The biological activity\nof fucoidans depend on the seaweed source, the compositional\nand structural traits, the content (charge density), distribution,\nand bonding of the sulfate substitutions, and the purity of the\nfucoidan product. Thus the extraction process employed for\nthe fucoidans is crucially important for maintaining the\nstructural integrity and the relevant structural features\nrequired for specific biological activity. A consistent extraction\nprocess is also a prerequisite for elucidating the structure–\nfunction relationship that promotes these biological proper-\nties. The lack of a standardized extraction methodology\nprevents detailed comparison and most importantly obstructs\nthe understanding of the correlation between fucoidan\nFig. 1Enzymatic attack patterns ofa-L-fucoidan endohydrolase and fucosidase, respectively: For simplicity, we have distinguished the cleavage patterns as type 1 for\n(1A4)-a-L-fucoidan endohydrolase and type 2 for (1A3)-a-L-fucoidan endohydrolase; and theexo-action, EC 3.2.1.51, as type 3.

As a\nconsequence, no pharmaceutical, dermatological, nutraceuti-\ncal or other applications have as yet been officially approved\nfor these polysaccharides or their lower molar mass oligosac-\ncharide derivatives. Nevertheless, fucoidan capsules are\nmarketed as nutracuetical supplements, and seaweed extracts\nhave been used as a remedy in traditional medicine in parts of\nAsia, notably in Japan, the Philippines, and Koreas for\ncenturies.\n5.1 Fucoidan bioactivity and potential applications\nAlgal fucoidans have been the subject of numerous scientific\nstudies due to their diverse biological functions and possible\ntherapeutic properties including antitumor, immunomodula-\ntory,\n45 anti-inflammatory,6 antithrombotic, and anticoagulant\neffects.46 The direct anti-proliferative effects of fucoidan\npolysaccharides against certain cancer cells have been shown\nin vitro using cell viability analysis. Both FCSPs from\nSargassum sp. and more classic fucoidan polysaccahrides from\nFucus vesiculosus significantly decreased the viable number of\nlung carcinoma and melanoma cells in vitro in a dose–\nresponse fashion.\n45 Histochemical staining showed morpho-\nlogical changes of melanoma cells after exposure to the\nfucoidans and were indicative of crude fucoidan induced\napoptosis.\n45 Fucoidan was also reported to induce apoptosis in\nHT-29 colon cancer cells, 47 MCF-7 human breast cancer\ncells,48 and HS-Sultan human lymphoma cells. 49 It has been\nsuggested that the bioactive properties of fucoidans are\ndefined by their structural make-up, and notably related to\nthe fucose sulfated chains.\n15 Nevertheless, it appears that the\nanti-cancer activity of fucoidans is not a function of a single\nspecific structural trait but a combination of many factors\nsuch as the amount of sulfate groups, the monosaccharide\ncomposition, and the types of linkages of the sugar\nresidues.\n1,30 Some findings indicate that the antitumor activity\nof fucoidan is a result of an indirect effect which may be\nassociated with a significant enhancement of the cytolytic\nactivity of natural killer (NK) cells augmented by increased\nproduction of macrophage-mediated immune response signal-\ning molecules,\n50,51 namely interleukins (IL)-2, IFN- c and IL-\n12.50 Hence, stimulation with IL-2 and IL-12 may promote the\nsecretion of IFN- c by NK cells, probably via enhanced NK cell\nactivity by fucoidan.\nThe bioactive properties of fucoidans currently attract\nresearch institutions and private companies to undertake\ncomprehensive investigations for potential applications of\nfucoidan molecules in the nutraceutical food ingredients\nindustry and in the cosmetic industry. In the USA and UK,\nfucoidan is already commercially available as health supple-\nments in the form of beverages and tablets which are mostly\nmarketed over the internet. Brown seaweeds like Cladosiphon\nokamuranus (Mozuku) and Undaria pinnatifida (Mekabu), and\nLaminaria japonica(Kombu) are the most important sources of\nfucoidans in Japan. The company Kanefuku Co, Ltd, Japan\nproduces and supplies fucoidan polysaccharides (Umi No\nShizuku) as a dietary supplement in the form of powder,\ncapsules and drinks to enhance the immune system and\nincrease longevity. Fucoidan products from Takara Bio Inc,\nJapan are marketed as an anti-inflammatory and immune-\nboosting formulation and used in nutritional drinks and\nfunctional foods. Production of pure fucoidan products is\nchallenging because of the presence of other polysaccharides,\nsuch as alginate. In Korea, Seaherb Co. Ltd. has patented a\ntechnology for the manufacture of low molecular weight\nfucoidan saccharides aimed at increasing absorption rate.\nHowever, this technology does not remove other polysacchar-\nide impurities but only degrades large molecular size\ncompounds (including contaminants such as alginate) to\nreduce the molecular sizes of the polysaccharides in the final\ncrude fucoidan product.\nApplicability of fucoidans as ‘‘cosmeceuticals’’ in the\ncosmetic industry has also been studied. Most of these studies\nfocus on the inhibitory effects of topically applied fucoidans\non aging and photo-damaged skin. Fucoidans may enhance\ndermal fibroblast proliferation and deposition of collagen;\n52\nprotect the elastic fiber network in human skin culture; 53 and\nto have potential for inclusion in lotion as a natural whitening\nagent.54 The prospects of using fucoidans as a protective agent\nin topical cosmetic formulations thus seem very promising.\nSince fucoidans are water soluble, they can easily be\nincorporated into lotions, creams and other beauty products.\nAs a pharmaceutical or nutraceutical ingredient, fucoidans\nclearly offer distinctive possibilities for immuno-modulation\nand anti-cancer effects.\n6 Conclusions and outlook\nBrown seaweed is an important source of valuable techno-\nfunctional and potentially bioactive polysaccharides. Among\nthe polysaccharides from brown seaweeds, fucoidans have\nturned out to exert potentially significant pharmaceutical\neffects, but at the same time to be a family of differently\nstructured polysaccharides comprising structural units having\ndistinct traits. Despite intensive research, the exact correla-\ntions between the various bioactivities and the molecular and\nstructural features of fucoidans still have to be clarified. It is\nknown now that the fine structural details of fucoidans vary\ndepending on seaweed type and species. Fucoidanases may\nprovide new tools for elucidation of detailed fucoidan\nstructures from various sources. Preservation of the structural\nintegrity of the fucoidan molecules appears crucial for\nmaintaining their biological properties. It has been convin-\ncingly shown that the extraction treatment employed affects\nthe composition and thus the structural features of the\nfucoidan substances. It is also clear that acid treatment used\nas the major step/steps in the extraction of fucoidans causes\ndegradation and affects the integrity of overall fucoidan make-\nup. Thus milder extraction procedures must be implemented\nin order to preserve the native fucoidan structures in order to\nbring out the distinct biological properties. The extraction\nmethodology employed may thus significantly affect the\nresults obtained when the fucoidan products are being\nevaluated for biological activity.

However,\nthe potential biological effects and the application possibi-\nlities for fucoidans seem promising.\nHarsh chemicals are environmentally burdensome and\nhave detrimental effects on the yield and compositions of the\nend product polysaccharides. These facts call for implementa-\ntion of milder and greener extraction technologies for\nfucoidan polysaccharides from brown seaweeds. Seaweeds\nmay in general represent a renewable biomass source that can\nbe cultivated for sustainable processes and products. More\nresearch is warranted to improve extraction and purification of\ndefined fucoidan polysaccharide structures from brown\nseaweeds using gentler methods especially in relation to\nscale-up for industrial production.\nReferences\n1 M.
