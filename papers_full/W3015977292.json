    "abstract": "In order to realize distributed measurement of transformer winding temperature and deformation, a transformer winding modification scheme with a built-in distributed optical fiber was designed. By laying a single-mode fiber and a multi-mode fiber on the transformer winding, the Brillouin optical time domain reflection technique (BOTDR) and the Raman optical time domain reflection technique (ROTDR) are used to measure the strain and temperature of the winding to complete the more accurate winding deformation detection. The accuracy of strain and temperature sensing of this scheme was verified by simulation. Then, according to the scheme, a winding model was actually wound, and the deformation and temperature rise tests were carried out. The test results show that this scheme can not only realize the deformation detection and positioning of the winding, but can also realize the measurement of the winding temperature; the temperature measurement accuracy reached ±0.5 °C, the strain measurement accuracy was 200 με, and spatial resolution was up to 5 m. In this experiment, the deformation location with the precision of 2 turns was realized on the experimental winding.",
