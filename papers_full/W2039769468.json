The\norganism is resistant to various broad-spectrum antibiotics and\ncapitalises on the disruption of the normal intestinal flora to cause\ndisease symptoms ranging from asymptomatic carriage to a\nfulminant, relapsing and potentially fatal colitis [1,2]. Sophisticat-\ned genetic tools to modify essential biological processes at the\nmolecular level are pivotal in enabling the systematic study of the\nbasis of colonization, virulence and pathogenesis ofC. difficile. The\nrequisite systems ideally need to be able to both make precise,in\nsitu alterations to existing alleles, as well as introduce entirely new\nalleles to progress hypothesis driven research. The former include\nthe generation of in-frame deletions and the introduction or\ncorrection of single or multiple nucleotide substitutions, deletions\nand insertions. The latter is required both to add entirely new, or\naltered alleles or provide the facility for the complementation of\ndistal mutant alleles at chromosomal gene dosage.\nFor many years the required level of sophistication has been\nunavailable. Thus, directed mutants could only be made using\ninsertional mutagens, reliant either on replication deficient [3] or\ndefective [4,5] plasmids, or on the deployment of the ClosTron\nand group II intron re-targeting [6,7]. Recently, however, the\ncytosine deaminase gene (codA)o fEscherichia coliwas developed as a\nnegative/counter selection marker for C. difficile, which enabled\nprecise manipulation of the C. difficile chromosome for the first\ntime [8]. In parallel, a second method (Allele-Coupled Exchange,\nACE) has been formulated that allows the rapid insertion of\nheterologous DNA, of any size or complexity, into the genome [9].\nWhilst a number of different genetic loci may be used to insert\nheterologous DNA via ACE, one exemplification of the method\nexploits the native pyrE gene, bringing about its inactivation by\nreplacement of the wild type allele with a mutant allele lacking the\ncodons from both the 59 and 39 end of the structural gene. The\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 February 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e56051\npyrE gene encodes orotate phosphoribosyltransferase\n[E.C.2.4.2.10]), which is an enzyme involved inde novopyrimidine\nbiosynthesis. It may be used as a positive/negative selection\nmarker as it is essential in the absence of exogenous pyrimidines\nand it also renders 5-fluoro-orotate (FOA) toxic to cells. Toxicity\noccurs via a series of steps which result in misincorporation of\nfluorinated nucleotides into DNA and RNA and hence, cause cell\ndeath.\nMutant strains defective in pyrE created using ACE become\nauxotrophs requiring exogenous uracil to grow. They also lends\nthemselves to the use of a functionalpyrE allele as a negative/\ncounter selection marker in a similar way to codA [8].The\nfunctionally equivalent gene, URA5, and URA3 (encoding\norotidine-phosphate decarboxylase) have been widely used as\nnegative selection markers inSaccharomyces cerevisiae [10]. Indeed,\nthis approach has allowed homologous gene replacement in a\nrange of different microbes [11–14], including most recently\nClostridium thermocellum [15] using the organisms own pyrF gene\n(equivalent to URA3) in a specifically createdDpyrF mutant. Not\nunexpectedly, the DpyrF strain created required the addition of\nexogenous uracil to achieve equivalent cell density to the wild type\nin the rich media employed. With supplementation, whilst growth\nwas slightly delayed, the eventual the growth rate was comparable\nto wildtype [15].\nIn this study, we have developed a procedure for the generation\nof allelic exchange mutants inpyrE mutants of two different strains\nof C. difficile (strain 630Derm and a BI/NAP1/PCR-Ribotype 027\nstrain, R20291) using a heterologouspyrE allele from Clostridium\nsporogenes as a negative/counter-selection marker. Use of a\nheterologous pyrE allele avoids homologous recombination with\nthe native pyrE locus of C. difficile. The system has been used to\nmake in-frame deletions in three different genes,spo0A (the master\nregulator of sporulation), cwp84 (which encodes a cysteine\nprotease) and mtlD (which encodes mannitol-1-phosphate 5-\ndehydrogenase). Crucially, having created these mutants, a specific\nACE-vector is used to rapidly (within 5–7 days) restore the\nchromosomal pyrE allele to wild-type, allowing the specific in-\nframe deletion mutant to be characterised in a clean, wild-type\nbackground. Moreover, variants of the same vector may be used to\ndeliver the wild-type allele of the deleted gene, either under the\ncontrol of its native promoter or the strongfdx promoter, into the\ngenome. The former allows complementation studies to be\nperformed at an appropriate gene dosage, while the latter\npotentially allows the assessment of the effect of overexpressing\nthe gene.\nResults\nConstruction of apyrE2 mutant of R20291\nThe pyrE2 mutant of strain 630Derm was previously made using\nAllele-Coupled Exchange (ACE) and the purpose built, replication\ndefective vector pMTL-JH18::lambda6.5 [9]. It is based on the\nreplicon of plasmid pCB102 [16], previously shown to be the least\neffective (most unstable in terms of segregation into daughter cells)\nin strain 630 Derm of the four replicons available in the\npMTL80000 modular vector series [17]. In strain R20291,\nhowever, the plasmid pBP1 replicon is the most defective, ie.,\nplasmids that use this replication region are more rapidly lost in\nthe absence of antibiotic selection [18]. Accordingly, pMTL-YN18\nwas constructed in order to generate apyrE mutant of C. difficile\nR20291 (Figure 1). pMTL-YN18 is equivalent to the pMTL-\nJH18::lambda6.5 vector used to construct aDpyrE mutant in C.\ndifficile 630Derm, except the pCB102 replicon is substituted with\nthat of pBP1 and the 6.5 kb fragment of phage lambda DNA is\nabsent. It carries two asymmetric homology arms that flank alacZ’\nmultiple cloning site (MCS) region. The shorter, 300 bp left-hand\nhomology arm (LHA) is composed of a variantpyrE allele that\nlacks 50 nucleotides from the 59-end of the gene and is devoid of\n235 bp from the 39-end of the gene. The larger 1200 bp right-\nhand homology arm (RHA) encompasses the region residing\nimmediately downstream of thepyrE gene in theC. difficilegenome.\nPlasmid pMTL-YN18 was used to generate apyrE mutant ofC.\ndifficile R20291. Five independent fluoroorotic acid (FOA) resistant\ncolonies were chosen and shown to be pyrE deletion mutants.\nThus, they all required exogenous uracil for growth on minimal\nmedia, were no longer thiamphenicol resistant, consistent with\nplasmid loss, and generated a PCR fragment of the expected size\n(623 bp) using primers that flanked the pyrE locus (Supporting\nInformation File S1). Nucleotide sequence of the 623 bp fragment\ngenerated confirmed the presence of the expected deletion.\nRestoration of pyrE+ phenotype in 630Derm and R20291\nWith pyrE mutants of bothC. difficile 630Derm and R20291, it\nwas desirable to demonstrate that they could be converted back to\nuracil prototrophy, through restoration of thepyrE locus to wild-\ntype. Accordingly, ACE plasmids pMTL-YN1 and pMTL-YN2\nwere constructed to correct the pyrE mutations in C. difficile\n630Derm and R20291, respectively (Figure 2). These plasmids were\nFigure 1. Plasmid pMTL-YN18. The ACE vector pMTL-YN18 is\ndesigned to create a deletion mutant specifically in theC. difficilestrain\nR20191. Plasmid components are: CatP, the catP gene of Clostridium\nperfringens conferring thiamphenicol resistance; ColE1, the replication\nregion of theE.coli plasmid ColE1; TraJ, transfer function of the RP4oriT\nregion; RepA and Orf2, the replication region of the Clostridium\nbotulinum plasmid pBP1; LHA, left-hand homology arm encompassing a\n300 bp internal fragment of the R20291 pyrE gene lacking 50\nnucleotides from the 59-end, and 235 bp from the 39-end; RHA, right-\nhand homology arm comprising encompassing the 1200 bp region of\nDNA immediately downstream of pyrE, and; lacZ’, gene encoding the\nalpha fragment of theE.coli b-galactosidase (and containing a multiple\ncloning site region derived from plasmid pMTL20 [19]).\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0056051.g001\nAllelic Exchange inC. difficile Using PyrE\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 February 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e56051\nbroadly equivalent to pMTL-JH14, used to correct a similarpyrE\nmutation in C. acetobutylicum [9], with apyrE allele that lacked the\nfirst 50 nucleotides of the open-reading-frame forming the short\n300 bp LHA. Crucially, they differed from pMTL-JH14 in that\nthey did not carry thelacZ’region present in this plasmid between\nthe LHA and RHA. As a consequence, the strains generated using\nthem would be indistinguishable from the wild-type at thepyrE\nlocus. Both plasmids were conjugated into their respectivepyrE\nmutants from anE. coliCA434 donor and, following the procedure\noutlined in MATERIALS AND METHODS, several dozen\ncolonies were obtained that were able to grow without uracil\nsupplementation. Six random colonies from each strain were\nscreened by PCR using primers which annealed to the chromo-\nsomal genes that reside up- and down-stream of thepyrE gene. In\nall cases, the expected 2,058 bp band was generated, equivalent to\nthe wild-type control, whereas no band was generated when the\ntemplate DNA was derived from the pyrE mutant (Supporting\nInformation File S1). Nucleotide sequencing of the fragment\ngenerated confirmed that the cells carried a wild typepyrE gene.\nFormulation of the components of an Allelic Exchange\nvector\nAside from the gene specific knock-out cassettes, the two most\nimportant components of the desired allelic exchange vector are\nthe pyrE allele, to be used as the negative/counter-selection\nmarker, and the clostridial plasmid replicon. In the case of thepyrE\nallele, it is desirable that the gene used is heterologous, to avoid\nrecombination at the native chromosomalpyrE locus ofC. difficile.\nTherefore, we selected thepyrE gene ofClostridium sporogenes, which\nshares only 65% identity with itsC. difficile equivalent. The pyrE\ngene was cloned into pMTL83151 and the resultant plasmid\n(pMTL-ME2, Figure 4) shown to be able to restore theC. difficile\npyrE mutants to prototrophy, ie., they were able to grow on\nminimal media lacking uracil supplementation (data not shown).\nThe isolation of the initial, single cross-over plasmid integrants\nrequired for the creation of allelic exchange mutants is facilitated\nby the use of ‘pseudo-suicide’ vectors [8,18]. These are plasmids\ncarrying catP (encoding resistance to thiamphenicol) that are\nsufficiently replication defective for there to be a significant growth\ndisadvantage in the presence of thiamphenciol compared to cells\nin which the plasmid, together with catP, has integrated. Such\nintegrated clones grow faster, and produce larger colonies, on agar\nmedia supplemented with thiamphenicol, because all of the\nprogeny carry a copy of catP. Cells carrying catP on a non-\nintegrated, defective autonomous plasmid, in contrast, grow slower\nbecause in the presence of antibiotic they are limited by the rate at\nwhich the plasmid is segregated amongst the daughter population.\nPreviously, the pCB102-based plasmid had been made more\ndefective in strain 630Derm by increasing the size of the final vector\nthrough the insertion of 6.5 kb of DNA derived from phage\nFigure 2. PyrE ACE correction vectors forC. difficile 630Derm (pMTL-YN1) and R20291 (pMTL-YN2). Both vectors carry identical\ncomponents between their FseI and SbfI restriction sites. These are: CatP, the catP gene of Clostridium perfringens conferring thiamphenicol\nresistance; ColE1, the replication region of theE.coli plasmid ColE1, and; TraJ, transfer function of the RP4oriT region. Plasmids pMTL-YN1C and pMTL-\nYN2C have an additional segment of DNA inserted between the left-hand homology arm (LHA) and the right-hand homology arm (RHA) which\ncarries: a transcriptional terminator (T1) of the ferredoxin gene ofClostridium pasteurianum; a copy of thelacZ’gene encoding the alpha fragment of\nthe E.coli b-galactosidase, and; a multiple cloning site (MCS) region derived from plasmid pMTL20 [19]. Plasmids pMTL-YN1X and pMTL-YN2X differ\nfrom pMTL-YN1C and pMTL-YN2C, respectively, in that they carrying the promoter region (P\nfdx) of theClostridium sporogenes ferredoxin gene.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0056051.g002\nAllelic Exchange inC. difficile Using PyrE\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 February 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e56051\nlambda [9]. Here we took a different strategy, and explored the\neffect of introducing a frame-shift mutation into the 39-end of\nputative repH gene of the pCB102 replication region. Accordingly,\nthe modular plasmid pMTL83251 was cleaved with NsiI, treated\nwith T4 polymerase and subjected to self-ligation, yielding\npMTL83*251. Nucleotide sequencing confirmed that the expected\nmodification had occurred, altering the sequence ATGCAT to\nAT. The resulting deletion of 4 nucleotides (TGCA) causes a\nframe-shift in the coding sequence, replacing the COOH-terminal\nregion of RepH (CIKYYARSFKKAHVKKSKKKK) with\nLNIMGALKKLM. The effect on segregational stability was\ntested by growing cells of 630Derm carrying either pMTL83251 or\npMTL83*251 in the absence of antibiotic selection and measuring\nplasmid loss. The results are shown in Figure 3, and demonstrate\nthat the frame-shift has caused a significant reduction in the\nsegregational stability of the plasmid.\nAccordingly, the NsiI site of plasmid pMTL-ME2 was similarly\nframe-shifted, and the resulting plasmid was designated pMTL-\nYN3 (Figure 4). For manipulations in R20291, the pCB102\nreplication region of pMTL-YN3 was simply replaced with that of\npBP1, by cleaving pMTL-YN3 with AscI and FseI and replacing\nthe excised fragment carrying the pCB102 replicon with the\nequivalent fragment from the pBP1-based plasmid pMTL82251\n[17]. The resulting plasmid was designated pMTL-YN4 (Figure 4).\nExemplification of the System to createspo0A mutants of\nstrains 630Derm and R20291\nTo test the system, we made in-frame deletions in thespo0A\ngene of both C. difficile 630Derm and R20291 using plasmids\npMTL-YN3::630spo0A* and pMTL-YN4::R20291spo0A*, respec-\ntively, as detailed in the allele exchange procedure outlined in\nMATERIALS AND METHODS. After two (630Derm) and four\n(R20291) passages of the transconjugants on BHIS selective media,\none of the six visibly larger colonies derived from 630Derm, and\nfour of the six visibly larger colonies derived from R20291, were\nfound to be pure single crossover mutants by PCR (data not\nshown). Subsequently, single colonies were re-streaked onto\nminimal medium supplemented with FOA and uracil to select\nfor cells in which the integrated plasmid had excised. The isolated\nFOA resistant colonies (four in the case of 630Derm and twelve in\nthe case of R20291) were then screened by PCR using primers\nspo0A-YN-F2 and spo0A-YN-R2 that anneal to the upstream and\nthe downstream sequence of spo0A, respectively. Of the four\n630Derm colonies screened, one yielded the expected 1,845 bp\nDNA fragment, indicative of an in-frame deletion (Supporting\nInformation File S1). The other colonies yielded a 2,331 bp DNA\nfragment, consistent with the presence of a wild-type copy of the\ngene. In the case of R20291, two of the twelve colonies screened\nyielded the 1,845 bp DNA fragment indicative of an in-frame\ndeletion (Supporting Information File S1). Nucleotide sequencing\nof the 1,845 bp DNA fragments confirmed that the expected\nallelic exchange event had taken place in all three putative\nmutants.\nThe sporulation minus phenotype of the mutants was confirmed\nby assaying colony forming units (cfu) on BHIS supplemented with\n0.1% [w/v] sodium taurocholate before and after heat shock\n(65uC for 30 min), as previously described [20]. In each case, no\ncolonies were obtained after heat shock, whereas the wild type\ncontrols gave counts of 1.28610\n4 and 9.176104 cfu for CRG2548\n(R20191DpyrE) and CRG2547 (630 DermDpyrE), respectively.\nPhase contrast microscopy confirmed that unlike the wild type\nstrains, phase-bright spores were absent in the mutant cultures.\nCreation and in situ complementation of in-frame\ndeletion mutants ofcwp84\nTo further test the system, we constructed mutants of thecwp84\ngene of both 630Derm and R20291. Cwp84 is a cysteine protease\nresponsible for the post-translational cleavage of SlpA into the two\nproteins High Molecular Weight (HMW) and Low Molecular\nWeight (LMW) SlpA, which are the major components of theC.\ndifficile surface layer. ClosTron mutants ofcwp84 have been made\nelsewhere inC. difficile 630Derm [21,22], and in the one study [22]\ncomplemented using an autonomous plasmid. cwp84 in-frame\ndeletion mutants were constructed following an identical proce-\ndure to that used to isolate the spo0A mutants, using plasmids\npMTL-YN3::630cwp84* and pMTL-YN4::R20291cwp84*. One of\nthe three 630Derm FOA resistant colonies screened yielded a\n1,218 bp PCR product, indicative of the desired in-frame deletion\n(Supporting Information File S1). In the case of R20291, three of\nfour FOA resistant colonies screened yielded the 1,218 bp PCR\nproduct, indicative of the desired in-frame deletion (Supporting\nInformation File S1). Nucleotide sequencing of the 1,218 bp\nfragments confirmed that the desired in-frame deletion had been\nobtained.\nA second round ofpyrE-based allele exchange was carried out in\nthe 630 Derm and R20291 cwp84 mutants, using pMTL-\nYN3::630cwp84c and pMTL-YN4::R20291cwp84c, respectively, to\nrestore the mutant alleles back to wild-type,in situ. A conservative\nbase substitution was made to introduce a ScaI restriction site into\nthe restored cwp84 sequence (Figure 5A). Three 630Derm FOA\nresistant colonies were screened and yielded a 1.1 kb PCR product\nwith primers cwp84-F4 and cwp84-R4, indicating that thecwp84\nallele had been successfully restored (Figure 5B). Subsequent\ndigestion of the PCR products with ScaI confirmed that\nrestoration of thecwp84 allele had been successful in each of the\nthree clones screened (Figure 5C). Similar analysis was carried out\non nine R20291 FOA resistant clones. Successful restoration of\ncwp84 was confirmed in each of the nine clones, as evidenced by a\n1.1 kb PCR product which was cleaved by Sca I (data not shown).\nBefore carrying out any phenotypic characterisation, thecwp84\nmutants and their restored derivatives were converted back to a\npyrE-positive (uracil prototrophy) phenotype using pMTL-YN1\nFigure 3.

The two plasmids differ only in that\npMTL83*251 has a frame shift in the pCB102 RepH gene, introduced by\nblunt-end ligation following cleavage with NsiI. Cells carrying the two\nplasmids were grown in BHIS media in the absence of antibiotic and\nthen CFUs estimated on agar media supplemented with thiamphenicol\nafter 6, 12 and 24 h of growth. The illustrated data was derived from\nthree independent experiments.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0056051.g003\nAllelic Exchange inC. difficile Using PyrE\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 February 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e56051\nand pMTL-YN2 for the 630Derm-derived strains and the R20291-\nderived strains, respectively. In keeping with previous observations\n[21,22], the mutants grew poorly on anaerobic blood agar\ncompared to the wild-type and the complemented strains\n(Supporting Information File S1). S-layer extracts from the WT,\nmutant and complemented strains were prepared by the glycin\nacid method. The absence of the Cwp84 protease in the 630Derm\nand R20291 mutant strains was confirmed by immunoblot\nanalysis with anti-Cwp84 antibodies (Figure 6A). Furthermore,\nwhile glycin extracts of both the 630Derm wild type strain and the\ncomplemented mutant contained two bands corresponding to the\ncleaved HMW and LMW S-layer proteins, only a band\ncorresponding to the unprocessed SlpA precursor was evident in\nthe cwp84 mutant strain (Figure 6B). Interestingly, whilst broadly\nequivalent results were obtained with the R20291 strains, it was\nclear that thecwp84 mutant contained two lower intensity bands,\nmost likely corresponding to the HMW and LMW, in addition to\nthe SplA precursor (Figure 6B). The identity of the HMW-SLP\nband was further confirmed by immunoblot (Figure 6C). This\nsuggests that some proteolytic cleavage of SlpA may have occurred\nin the R20219 mutant, despite the absence of Cwp84.\nCreation and rapidin transcomplementation of in-frame\ndeletion mutants\nWhilst the in situ complementation of mutant alleles represents\nthe ‘gold standard’, the procedure required is lengthy (approx. 3–4\nweeks), and therefore adds to the time needed to characterise a\nmutant. An alternative strategy would be, having made a specific\nin-frame deletion in apyrE strain, to use ACE to introduce a wild\ntype copy of the gene into the chromosome at the pyrE locus\nconcomitant with the correction of this allele back to a PyrE-\npositive phenotype. Accordingly, complementation vectors\n(pMTL-YN1C and pMTLYN2C, for strains 630 and R20291,\nrespectively) were constructed (MATERIALS AND METHODS)\nespecially for this purpose, together with derivatives (pMTL-\nYN1X and pMTLYN2X, for strains 630 and R20291, respec-\ntively) carrying a strong promoter (thefdx promoter) to direct the\nover expression of the complementing gene. In contrast toin situ\ncomplementation, and as a consequence of being able to directly\nselect for uracil prototrophy without the need to isolate pure single\ncrossover clones, the successful introduction of genes using these\nvectors takes between 5 and 7 days.\nTo test the utility of this approach, we targeted themtlD gene\nwhich forms part of the operon responsible for mannitol\nmetabolism in C. difficile strain 630Derm, using plasmid pMTL-\nYN3::630mtlD. The ability ofC. difficile to ferment mannitol is a\ndistinguishing feature and forms the basis of CDSA (Clostridium\ndifficile Selective Agar) developed by Becton Dickinson [23].\nFermentation of mannitol in this medium causes a pH drop, which\ncauses the indicator present to change in color, from red to yellow.\nIn many bacteria mannitol is transported into the cell via a typical\nphosphotransferase system (PTS), and therefore couples transport\nto phosphorylation of the sugar [24]. Themtl operon in E. coli\nconsists of themtlA, mtlR, andmtlD genes that respectively encode\nFigure 4.

The\narrangement of genes in C. difficile 630Derm is predicted to be\nequivalent to that of B. stearothermophilus and comprises four\nputative genes:mtlA (enzyme IICBmtl), mtlR, mtlF (enzyme IIAmtl),\nand mtlD [26,27].\nFollowing transfer of the knock-out plasmid pMTL-\nYN3::630mtlD into C. difficile 630Derm, three FOA resistant clones\nwere isolated. PCR screening using primers mtlD-F3 and mtlD-\nR3, that anneal to the upstream and the downstream sequence of\nmtlD, demonstrated that two clones wereDmtlD mutants, yielding a\nPCR product of 1,418 bp, while the third clone was a wild type\nrevertant, yielding a PCR product of 2,582 bp (Supporting\nInformation File S1). Nucleotide sequencing of the 1,418 bp\nproducts confirmed that the desiredmtlD in-frame deletion had\nbeen created.\nOn isolation of themtlD mutant, thepyrE\n2 gene was converted\nback to pyrE+ using plasmid pMTL-YN1 as described above. In\naddition, two further derivatives of pMTL-YN1 were employed\nwhich simultaneously delivered a functional copy of themtlD wild\ntype gene into the genome immediately downstream of the\ncorrected pyrE gene. Plasmid pMTL-YN1CmtlD introduced the\nmtlD structural gene into the chromosome together with its native\npromoter. In contrast, pMTL-YN1XmtlD placed the inserted gene\nunder the control of the strongfdx promoter. In both instances, the\ninserted mtlD gene was followed by the transcriptional terminator\nsequence [6] derived from the ferredoxin gene of Clostridium\npasteurianum. The purpose of the terminator was to prevent polar\neffects being exerted by the inserted gene on the downstream gene,\nCD0188. In both cases, six independent PyrE+ clones able to grow\non minimal media in the absence of uracil were screened for the\npresence of the wild type allele by PCR using primers Cdi630-\npyrD-sF1 and Cdi630-CD0189-SR3. All twelve clones gave the\nexpected 2,058 bp DNA product, equivalent to a wild type\ncontrol. Nucleotide sequencing confirmed its identity as a wild\ntype pyrE allele.\nPhenotypic analysis confirmed that the mtlD mutant was no\nlonger able to ferment mannitol. Thus, in contrast to the wild type\nFigure 5. PCR screening of double crossover candidate clones\nfor complementation of thecwp84 gene inC. difficile630 Derm\nDcwp84.

The complemented mutant, on\nthe other hand grew at the same rate as the wild type, as did the\ncomplemented mutant in which the native mtlD promoter had\nbeen replaced with the strongfdx promoter. In this instance, at\nleast, any phenotypic benefit of increasing the expression ofmtlD\ncould not be measured.\nFinally, to confirm the utility of this approach to complemen-\ntation, we created the complementation plasmids pMTL-YN1C-\nspo0A and pMTL-YN2Cspo0A (MATERIALS AND METHODS)\nand used them to insert a functional copy of the strain 630Derm\nspo0A gene into the genomes of the spo0A mutants of strains\n630Derm and R20291 concomitant with restoration of the pyrE\nmutant allele back to wild type. The sporulation phenotypes of the\nresultant strains were restored to that of the wildtype (Supporting\nInformation File S1).\nDiscussion\nFor many years the gene tools available to bring about specific,\ndirected modifications ofC. difficile at the genetic level were scant\nindeed. In the present study we have capitalised on the\ndevelopment of ACE technology to devise and exemplify methods\nfor the generation and complementation of precise allelic\nexchange mutants in theC. difficile genome based on the use of\nvarious pyrE alleles. The use of genes involved in uracil\nmetabolism, such as pyrE and pyrF, as a negative-/counter-\nselection marker has previously been demonstrated in a number of\ndifferent bacteria and yeast [10–15], where it is reliant on the\ninitial creation of a mutant defective in the chosen gene to act as\nthe host for mutant construction. The deployment of ACE\ntechnology ensures this is a relatively simple and rapid undertak-\ning. More important, as demonstrated here, ACE may be used to\nrapidly convert the host back topyrE\n+, allowing the assessment of\nthe mutant phenotype in a ‘clean’, wild type background. Such an\nundertaken has not generally been applied in other systems. Thus,\nfor instance, the mutants created inC. thermocellum [15] using the\norganisms own pyrF gene as a counter-selection marker were\nalways analysed in theDpyrF strain in which they were created.\nSimilarly, a mutagenesis system developed inBacillus subtilis, based\non the use of theupp gene [28], has been adapted for use inC.\nacetobutylicum (P Soucaille, pers comm.) and is always undertaken,\nand the resultant mutants made analysed in, aupp- background.\nThe use of a background defective in nucleoside metabolism can\ncomplicate the assessment of the effect of the mutation under\nanalysis. This is particularly the case in the investigation of\npathogens and virulence, where mutants in nucleoside metabolism\nare considered a form of disablement in their own right [29]. This\nhas considerable impact on studies designed to assess the effect of\nmutation of other loci on virulence, particularlyin vivo.\nWe have demonstrated the robustness and reliability of thispyrE\nmethod of mutagenesis in bothC. difficile 630 Derm and C. difficile\nR20291, through the creation of in-frame deletion mutants in\nspo0A, cwp84 and mtlD. We have re-affirmed the value of strategies\nbased on pseudo-suicide vectors, and in the case of 630 Derm\nimproved the options available through the further disablement of\nthe pCB102 replicon used by the introduction of a frameshift in\nthe repH gene. This was found to facilitate the ease with which\nsingle crossover integrants were isolated, which tend to emerge\nafter just two passages of transconjugants on selective media. This\nFigure 7.

During the course of this work we\nhave confirmed that the annotatedmtlD locus is indeed involved in\nmannitol utilisation and re-affirmed that Cwp84 plays a role in the\nprocessing of SlpA. Intriguingly, we found that despite the\nintroduction of thecwp84 frame-shift in R20291, unlike 630Derm,\nsome processing of SlpA was still occurring in this strain. The in-\nframe deletion of both strains results in an internal deletion of 406\namino acids from the protein (total 804 amino acids). Whilst the\ntruncated protein that results still contains Cys116, an important\nresidue in the active site of the protease [22], it seems unlikely that\nthe protein retains proteolytic activity, particularly as the truncated\nprotein in the 630Derm mutant is identical. Moreover, no signal\nwas detected by immunoblot analysis in the two mutant strains,\nsuggesting that there is no expression at all of the protease, even in\na truncated form, or that this form is quickly degraded in the cell.\nPerhaps strain R20291 produces a secondary protease also able to\nprocess SlpA? At this stage no one explanation can be ruled out.\nHere our focus has been on the development and description of\nthe mutagenesis method, and our data on individual mutants\nremains observational.\nThe method developed here is in many respects equivalent to\nour recent description of the use ofcodA as a counter selection [8].\nIndeed, the allelic exchange cassettes and methodological proce-\ndures are the same, except counter-selection is based on\ndifferential resistance to FOA (PyrE) rather than FC (CodA).\nAccordingly, the isolation of mutants using either protocol takes\naround 3–4 weeks to accomplish once the allelic exchange vectors\nhave been constructed, and both methods may be subsequently\nemployed to undertake in situ complementation of the mutated\nallele (exchange of the mutant allele with the wild type gene). A\npivotal difference is that codA-based mutagenesis [8] can be\nundertaken in a wild type background (provided the host does not\ncarry a nativecodA gene, as is the case inC. botulinum, C. sporogenes\nand C. ljungdahlii), whereas the method described here requires the\ninitial creation of apyrE mutant which needs to be corrected back\nto wild type once a mutant at a distal locus has been created.\nHowever, using ACE, this is rapid (5 days), and provides the\nopportunity to complement the mutant in parallel, through\nconcomitant insertion of a wild type copy of the gene either\nunder the control of its native promoter, or the strong fdx\npromoter.\nComplementation is essential to unequivocally confirm the role\nof a genetic determinant in a specific phenotype [30]. Comple-\nmentation is traditionally achieved using multicopy plasmids. The\nconsequent abnormal gene dosage can, however, frequently fail to\nrestore phenotype to wildtype levels. Thus, CwpV was over\nproduced in a plasmid complementedcwpV mutant of C. difficile\n[31], the perfringolysin O titre of avirR mutant of theC. perfringens\nstrain 56 was approximately 3-fold higher than the wild type strain\nwhen complemented with a multicopy plasmid carrying thevirRS\ngenes [32], while in a study of Clostridium septicum ‘haemolytic\nactivity of the complemented strain was higher than the parent\nstrain ….. presumably a reflection of the presence of thecsa gene\non a multicopy plasmid.’ [33]. In the study of Dingle and co-\nworkers [34], ‘although the wild-type 630Derm strain and thefliC\nmutant strain produced FliD, the fliC-complemented strain did\nnot, suggesting that there was a reduction infliD gene expression\nwhen FliC is expressed in trans off a plasmid rather than incis\nfrom the chromosomal gene’. Similarly, plasmid complemented\nagr mutants ofClostridium perfringensfailed to completely regain wild-\ntype sporulation levels [35], a phenomenon attributed by the\nauthors to ‘complementation involving a multicopy plasmid\ncarrying the clonedagr\nlocus’.\nAncillary effects can also arise when using plasmids for\ncomplementation studies due to the need to maintain plasmids,\nand the complementing gene, through supplementation with\nantibiotics. Thus, for instance, complementation of the a sleC\nmutation using a plasmid-located gene did not restore the\nphenotype to wild type [20], but did restore germination to the\nreduced level obtained in a vector only control. The presence of\nthe plasmid alone, and most likely the effect of the added\nthiamphenicol needed to maintain the plasmid, detrimentally\neffected spore germination. Consequently, the use of plasmid\ncomplementation systems may require the inclusion of a vector\nonly control [20]. This is not required when using ACE-based\ncomplementation at thepyrE locus. Crucially, the intrinsic stability\nof chromosomal complementation makes it the method of choice\nin those situations where plasmid maintenance through antibiotic\nsupplementation is not a viable option, such as when comple-\nmentation in anin vivo model is required.\nThe use of plasmids pMTL-YN1C and pMTL-YN2C positions\nthe complementing gene in the genome immediately downstream\nof the pyrE gene (CD0187). This allows read through from the\nupstream promoter responsible for transcription of pyrE, the\nidentity of which is unknown but may reside immediately\nupstream of CD0187 or, more likely, CD0184. The availability\nof transcriptional read through is important in those cases where\nthe identity of the natural promoter of the complementation gene\nis not defined, and cannot be guaranteed to be cloned along with\nthe structural gene, allowing, for instance, a promoter-less copy of\nthe structural gene to be cloned. In those instances where the\npromoter is defined, and the operator wishes to exclude read\nthrough, a transcriptional terminator may simply be added during\nthe cloning of the complementation gene and its promoter.\nIn certain instances it may be desirable to bring about\n‘overexpression’ of the complementing gene. For this purpose,\ntwo further vectors were constructed (pMTL-YN1X and\npMTLYN2X, for strains 630 and R20291, respectively) carrying\nthe promoter of the ferredoxin gene (fdx)o fClostridium sporogenes.A s\na consequence of its central role in anaerobic electron transfer, the\nferredoxin gene is highly expressed in Clostridium, with the\nferredoxin protein representing, for instance, up to 2% of the\nsoluble protein in Clostridium pasteurianum [36]. Indeed the fdx\npromoter ofC. perfringenshas been used to derive a highly effective\nclostridial expression system [37], while the C. sporogenes fdx\npromoter used here was employed to maximise expression of a\nnitroreductase gene inC. sporogenes [38].\nWhichever vectors are used, their deployment involves only\nmarginal additional effort compared to the use of autonomous\ncomplementation vectors. Thus, both methods (plasmid-based and\nACE-based complementation) involve the assembly of the\nrequisite vector in E. coli and its transformation into the\nappropriate clostridial mutant and the selection of transconjugants\non antibiotic supplemented plates. ACE-mediated complementa-\ntion merely requires re-streaking of the primary transconjugant\nonto minimal media lacking uracil. All those colonies that develop\nrepresent complemented strains in which thepyrE allele has been\ncorrected to wildtype. The additional time required, therefore,\nequates to merely the 2 days needed for uracil prototrophic\ncolonies to develop on the minimal media.\nConclusion\nWe have demonstrated the use of apyrE-based allele exchange\nsystem to make precise alterations to the genome ofC. difficile.I n\nusing a pyrE- strain as the host, by whatever means a mutant is\nmade (e.g., allelic exchange or ClosTron), the facility to insert a\nwild type copy of the gene at the pyrE locus provides a rapid\nAllelic Exchange inC. difficile Using PyrE\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 8 February 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e56051\nmechanism for generating a stable complementation clone that is\nnot compromised by inappropriate gene dosage effects.

Polymerase\nchain reactions (PCR) used FailsafeTM PCR system (Epicentre)\nand Taq polymerase (Promega) in accordance with the manufac-\nturers’ protocols using primers detailed in Table 1. Primer design\nfor amplification of DNA fromC. difficile 630 Derm and R20291\nstrains were based on the availableC. difficile genomes from the\nEMBL/GenBank databases with accession numbers AM180356\nand FN545816 respectively. The oligonucleotides and the\nplasmids/strains used in this study are listed in Table 1 and\nTable 2, respectively. All DNA manipulations and cloning\nprocedures were performed as per Sambrook [43].\nVector Construction\nPlasmid pMTL-YN18 (accession number; JX465728), used to\ncreate a pyrE2 mutant in R20291, is an equivalent vector to\npMTL-JH18 [9] in which the pCB102 replicon was replaced with\nthat of pBP1 (isolated from pMTL82251), using the flanking AscI\nand FseI sites specifically created for this purpose [17]. Plasmid\npMTL-YN1 (accession number; JX465729) was made by cloning\na 1,753 bp SbfI/AscI fragment between the corresponding\nrestriction sites of plasmid pMTL-JH20 [9]. This fragment was\ngenerated from the 630Derm genome by PCR using the primers\npyrE-int-SbfI-F and pyrEcomplement-Asc1-R, and carries a\ntruncated copy of pyrE, lacking the first 50 nucleotides of the\nstructural gene, together with 1200 bp from immediately 39 to the\nstop codon ofpyrE, which includes the entire coding sequence of\nCD0188 of 630Derm. To generate the equivalentpyrE correction\nvector (pMTL-YN2, accession number; JX465732) for R20291,\nthe pCB102 replicon of pMTL-YN1 was replaced with that of\npBP1 from pMTL82251 (using the AscI and FseI sites) and the\n630Derm DNA between the SbfI and AscI sites replaced with the\nequivalent region from the R20291 genome. In this case, the DNA\nwas synthesized by DNA2.0 specific to the R20291 chromosome\nby PCR as two contiguous SbfI/NdeI and NdeI/AscI fragments.\nThe PyrE complementation vector pMTL-ME2 was constructed\nby inserting the C. sporogenes ATCC 15579 pyrE gene into\npMTL83151. ThepyrE gene was amplified by PCR from genomic\nDNA prepared from Clostridium sporogenes ATCC 15579 using\nprimers Csp-pyrE-HpaI-sF1 and Csp-pyrE-HpaI-sR1. The PCR\nproduct was digested with HpaI and gel purified followed by\ncloning in same orientation ascatP in pMTL83151 [17] linearized\nwith the same enzyme.\nTo construct the ACE overexpression plasmids pMTL-YN1X\n(accession number; JX465731) and pMTL-YN2X (accession\nnumber; JX465734), a 214 bp NotI/NdeI fragment encompassing\nthe C. sporogenes fdx promoter was isolated from plasmid\npMTL82253 and inserted between the equivalent sites of\npMTL-JH14 [9]. The plasmid obtained (pMTL-JH14::Pcspfdx)\nwas cleaved with NheI, and ligated to two, annealed oligonucle-\notides (Cpa-TT-Oligo-1 and Cpa-TT-Oligo-2) which encom-\npassed the transcriptional terminator of theClostridium pasteurianum\nferredoxin gene. A 517 bp NotI/NheI fragment (encompassing\nthe fdx promoter, lacZ’ and multiple cloning sites, and the\ntranscriptional terminator of theC. pasteurianum ferredoxin gene)\nwas then isolated from the resultant plasmid (pMTL-ME6X) and\ninserted between the equivalent sites in pMTL-YN1 and\npMTLYN2, to yield pMTL-YN1X and pMTL-YN2X, respec-\ntively. In parallel, pMTL-ME6X was digested with EcoRI and\nNheI and the released 293 bp fragment inserted between the\nequivalent sites of pMTL-JH14 [9] to make pMTL-ME6C. This\nplasmid was then cleaved with NotI and NheI, and the released\n323 bp fragment inserted between the equivalent sites of pMTL-\nYN1 and pMTLYN2, to yield the complementation vectors\npMTL-YN1C (accession number; JX465730) and pMTL-YN2C\n(accession number; JX465733), respectively.\nAllelic Exchange Cassettes\nAllele exchange cassettes were assembled, specific to the three\ntarget loci (spo0A, cwp84 and mtlD) of the two strains, composed of\na left-hand homology arm (LHA) and a right-hand homology arm\n(RHA), each of approximately 500 to 800 bp in size. Each cassette\nwas cloned between theSbfI andAscI restriction recognition sites in\npMTL-YN3 (accession number; JX465735) to create pMTL-\nYN3::630spo0A*, pMTL-YN3::630cwp84* and pMTL-\nYN3::630mtlD*. Similarly, pMTL-YN3::R20291spo0A* and\npMTL-YN3::R20291cwp84* were made by cloning the allelic\nexchange cassettes between theAscI and SbfI sites in pMTL-YN4\n(accession number; JX465736).\nThe spo0A knockout cassette was synthesized by DNA2.0 which\nconsists of a 672 bp LHA (bases 1412012 to 1412789 on the\nforward strand ofC. difficile 630 Derm genome) fused to a 800 bp\nRHA (bases 1413275 to 1414074 on the forward strand ofC.\ndifficile 630 Derm genome) which were designed to make an in-\nAllelic Exchange inC. difficile Using PyrE\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 9 February 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e56051\nframe deletion removing codons 65 to 226, inclusive, out of a total\nof 275 codons). For the equivalent inC. difficile R20291, a 778 bp\nLHA (bases 1319650 to 1320427 on the forward strand of theC.\ndifficile R20291 genome) was fused to a 800 bp RHA (bases\n1320913 to 1321712 on the forward strand of the C. difficile\nR20291 genome). Each cassette was designed to incorporate aSbfI\nsite at the 59 end and anAscI site at the 39 end to facilitate cloning\ninto the pMTL-YN3 plasmid. The cwp84 knockout cassette\nconsists of a 653 bp LHA (bases 1045907 to 1046559 on the\nreverse strand of theC. difficile630 Derm genome) fused to a 558 bp\nRHA (bases 1047778 to 1048335 on the reverse strand of theC.\ndifficile 630 Derm genome) which were designed to remove codons\n214 to 629, inclusive, representing the removal of 417 codons from\na total of 814). For the equivalent inC. difficile R20291, a 713 bp\nLHA (bases 1067119 to 1067771 on the reverse strand of theC.\ndifficile R20291 genome) was fused to a 558 bp RHA (bases\n1068990 to 1069547 on the reverse strand of theC. difficileR20291\ngenome). The mtlD knockout cassette consists of a 654 bp LHA\n(bases 1593564 to 1594217 on the reverse strand of theC. difficile\n630 Derm genome) fused to a 654 bp RHA (bases 1595353 to\n1596006 on the reverse strand of theC. difficile 630 Derm genome)\nwhich were designed to make an in-frame deletion between codon\n3 and codon 387 ofmtlD (total codons 388).\nComplementation Vectors\nPlasmids for the complementation of the spo0A mutants of\nstrains R20291 and 630Derm were constructed as follows. The\nspo0A of strainC. difficile630Derm was PCR amplified as a 1216 bp\nDNA fragment using the two primers spo0A-SpeI-F and spo0A-\nBamHI-R and cloned in pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen) and verified\nby sequencing. Thespo0A was re-isolated as a 1.2 kb EcoRI and\nBamHI fragment and inserted between the equivalent sites of\npMTL-YN2C to give the R20291 complementation plasmid\npMTL-YN2Cspo0A. To derive an equivalent plasmid for strain\n630Derm, thespo0A gene was excised from pMTL-YN2Cspo0A as a\n1.2 kb DNA fragment following cleaved with NotI and BamHI\nand inserted into the appropriate sites of pMTL-YN1C to give the\ncomplementation plasmid pMTL-YN1Cspo0A.\nTo generate the two required allelic exchange cassettes need for\ncomplementation of thecwp84 in-frame deletions, the portion of\ncwp84 missing in the two plasmids (pMTL-YN4::R20291cwp84*\nand pMTL-YN3::630cwp84*) originally used to make the in-frame\ndeletions were synthesised (DNA2.0) as a 1,082 bp NdeI-KpnI\nfragment (R20291) and a 1,255 bp NdeI-XbaI fragment (630Derm)\ngenerated by cloned into the appropriate allelic exchange vectors\nto yield plasmids pMTL-YN4::R20291 cwp84\nc and pMTL-\nYN3::630cwp84c. In order to be able to distinguish the comple-\nmentation allele from wild type, the synthesised region included a\nsingle nucleotide change (T to A) to base 2280 ofcwp84 which\nretains the codon specificity (codon 760, Valine) but creates a ScaI\nrestriction enzyme recognition site.\nThe complementation plasmid pMTL-YN1C mtlD was con-\nstructed by the PCR amplification of theC. difficile 630Derm mtlD\ngene, together with its 5 9 non-coding region, as a 1,779 bp\nTable 1.List of oligonucleotides used in this study.\nOligonucleotide Binding site Sequence (5 9 to 39)\nCsp-pyrE-HpaI-sF1 pyrE of C.sporogenes AATATTGTTAACTAAGGAGAAGATATAAATGAGTAATATAAAT\nGTTATAGATATATTAAAAGAATCAAAT\nCsp-pyrE-HpaI-sR1 pyrE of C.sporogenes AATATGTTAACTTATTTTTGTTCTCTACTACCTGGTTTTACAAAAGGT\nCdi630-pyrD-sF1 pyrD of C. difficile AGAGAAGGAATAAAAAGTTTAGACGAAATAAGAGG\nl6.5-sF2 6.5 kbp HindIII fragment of phage lambda,\ninsert-specific reverse primer\nTATGAGTACCCTGTTTTTTCTCATGTTCAGG\nCdi630-CD0189-sR3 CD0189 of C. difficile,chromosome-specific reverse primer CCAAGCTCTATGACAGACAGCTCATTGTTTAGAAC\npyrE-int-SbfI-F pyrE of C. difficile 630 Derm and R20291 CTGCAGGGGAGGGACATTTTTTATTATCTTCAGG\npyrEcomplement-Asc1-R CD0188 of C. difficile 630 Derm and R20291 GGCGCGCCATAGTATATAACATTAATAAAATTTAAAATC\nspo0A-YN-F2 upstream of spo0A of C. difficile GGCAAGTATAAACTTGGATTATGGGTAAGAGAT\nspo0A-YN-R2 downstream of spo0A of C. difficile CTATATATCTTTCCATCTACAACTTCTATAG\ncwp84-F3 upstream of cwp84 of C. difficile TTCTATAATTAATATGTACTCATAATCC\nCwp84-F4 knockout region of cwp84 CTGGACAAGCTACTTCAGGAG\nCwp84-R4 downstream of cwp84 of C. difficile CTGGACAAGCTACTTCAGGAG\nmtlD-F3 upstream of mtlD of C. difficile CTAGAGAATAGAATCGTGCTAGATTCAAATGAAG\nmtlD-R3 downstream of mtlD of C. difficile CTTTAACTGAATACTCTCTTGCCTTAG\nmtlD-NotI-F upstream of mtlD, inclusive of RBS and promoter sequence GCGGCCGCTTTTTAATCACTCCTTATATTTTTATAC\nmtlD-BamHI-R end of coding sequence of mtlD GGATCCTTATAAATTTTTCATAAATATATAACTTTTTTCGATAT\nTATTTAAAAGTTCTTCG\nmtlD-NdeI-F start of mtlD coding sequence CATATGAAAAAGGCAATTCAGTTTGGAGCAGG\nCpa-TT-Oligo-1 transcriptional terminator of the Clostridium pasteurianum\nferredoxin gene\nCTAGTATAAAAATAAGAAGCCTGCATTTGCAGGCTTCTTATTTTTATG\nCpa-TT-Oligo-2 transcriptional terminator of the Clostridium pasteurianum\nferredoxin gene\nCTAGCATAAAAATAAGAAGCCTGCAAATGCAGGCTTCTTATTTTTATA\nspo0A-SpeI-F spo0A gene of C. difficile ATATACTAGTGGTATTTTTATAGATGAAATGATAAAATTGTAG\nspo0A-BamHI-R spo0A gene of C. difficile ATATGGATCCTCAGTTTACAACTTGTAAAGACAC\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0056051.t001\nAllelic Exchange inC. difficile Using PyrE\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 10 February 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e56051\nTable 2.List of strains and plasmids used in this study.\nStrains/Plasmids Relevant features Source\nE. coli Top10 mcrA D(mrr-hsdRMS-mcrBC) recA1 Invitrogen\nE. coli CA434 hsd20(rB-, mB-, recA13, rpsL20, leu, proA2, with IncPb conjugative plasmid R702 [31]\nC. difficile 630Derm Erythromycin sensitive strain of strain 630 [34]\nCRG1496 C. difficile 630Derm DpyrE This study\nCRG2547 Derived from CRG1496, in-frame deletion within spo0A, pyrE repaired to wildtype sequence This study\nCRG2302 Derived from CRG1496, in-frame deletion within cwp84, pyrE repaired to wildtype sequence This study\nCRG2445 Derived from CRG2302, in situ complementation of Dcwp84 with a single nucleotide\nchange, pyrE repaired to wildtype sequence\nThis study\nCRG2923 Derived from CRG1496, in-frame deletion within mtlD, pyrE repaired to wildtype sequence This study\nCRG2536 C. difficile 630_erm mtlD::intron ermB This study\nCRG2926 Derived from CRG2923, chromosomal complementation of mtlD with its natural RBS\nand promoter region, downstream ofpyrE\nThis study\nCRG2929 Derived from CRG2923, chromosomal complementation of mtlD preceded by the promoter\nregion (Pfdx)o ft h eClostridium sporogenesferredoxin gene, downstream ofpyrE\nThis study\nC. difficile R20291 wild-type BI/NAP1/027 Stoke Mandeville (2004–2005) isolate Anaerobe Reference Laboratory,\nCardiff, Wales, United Kingdom\nCRG2359 C. difficile R20291 DpyrE This study\nCRG2548 Derived from CRG2359, in-frame deletion within spo0A, pyrE repaired to wildtype sequence This study\nCRG2549 Derived from CRG2359, in-frame deletion within cwp84, pyrE repaired to wildtype sequence This study\nCRG3059 Derived from CRG2549, in situ complementation of Dcwp84 with a single nucleotide\nchange, pyrE repaired to wildtype sequence\nThis study\npMTL-YN18 same as pMTLJH18:: l6.5, but without thel6.5 fragment, homology arms are specific to\nR20291 sequence and pCB102 replicon replaced with pBP1\nThis study\npMTL-ME2 Derived from pMTL83151 through addition of a C. sporogenes pyrE and C. perfringens catP\ngene.

For\ninactivation of pyrE, E. coli CA434 donor cells carrying pMTL-\nYN18 were conjugated with R20291 and transconjugants selected\non BHIS media supplemented D-cycloserine (250mg/ml), cefox-\nitin (8 mg/ml), thiamphenicol (15mg/ml) and uracil (5mg/ml). A\nsingle transconjugant was re-streaked onto the same medium and\nthen a ‘large’ representative colony streaked onto minimal agar\nmedium agar supplemented with FOA (2 mg/ml) and uracil\n(5 mg/ml). The colonies that arose were re-streaked twice onto the\nsame media, and analyzed by PCR to confirm deletion ofpyrE (as\ndetailed in Results), and Sanger sequencing was used to confirm\nthe expected genotype. Confirmation that the plasmid had been\nlost, was obtained by patch plating onto BHIS agar supplemented\nwith thiamphenicol and establishing that no growth occurred. For\ncorrection of the pyrE mutation (ie., plasmids pMTL-YN1, 1C,\n1X, 2, 2C and 2X) transconjugants were streaked onto minimal\nmedia without uracil or FOA supplementation and those colonies\nthat developed analysed as above.\nAllelic exchange procedure\nThe adopted protocol resembles that used for the isolation of\nallelic exchange mutants usingcodA as a negative selection marker\n[8], except counter-selection was based on differential resistance to\nFOA rather than FC. It in essence involves the initial isolation of\npure single crossovers clones, and their subsequent transfer onto\nselective plates to identify those cells in which the plasmid has\nexcised. These clones correspond to colonies that are resistant to\nFOA as a consequence of loss of the heterologous PyrE+ allele and\nreversion to apyrE minus phenotype. Depending which homology\narm undergoes recombination, plasmid excision can result in\neither the desired double crossover mutant, or a wild type cell. In\nthe absence of any bias, the wild type cells and desired mutants\nshould be present in equal proportions, ie., 50:50.\nEach plasmid was conjugated into the appropriate host and\nplated onto BHIS media (supplemented with cycloserine, cefox-\notin, thiamphenicol and uracil) and the transconjugants restreaked\nonto fresh media to allow the identification of putative single\ncrossover mutants. These were readily identified as visibly larger\ncolonies after 16–24 hr. Such colonies were sequentially restreaked\nfrom single colonies and after 2–4 passages, their identify and\npurity confirmed by an appropriate PCR. Unlike ACE, where\npowerful selection allows the purification of the desired double\ncrossover excision event, it is crucial that the single cross-over\nintegrants are pure, and not contaminated with wild type cells, ie.,\ncells in which integration has not occurred. Otherwise, the\ncontaminating wild type cells, which are all resistant to FOA, will\ncause unacceptable high background when cells are plated on\nFOA media during the screen for the desired double crossover\nevents. To establish that no wild type cells were present, an\nappropriate primer pair (spo0A-YN-F2/spo0A-YN-R2 in the case\nof spo0A, cwp84-F3/cwp84-R4 in the case ofcwp84, and mtlD-F3/\nmtlD-R3 the case of mtlD) was used that annealed to the\nchromosome at positions that flanked the site of the in-frame\ndeletion but that were both distal to the regions that comprised the\nhomology arms of the plasmid borne allelic exchange cassette. The\nabsence of a DNA product of a size consistent with the wild type\nindicated clonal purity, and that wild type cells were not present.\nTo confirm that they were indeed single crossover integrants, two\ndifferent primers (M13F and M13R) were used that annealed to\nplasmid specific sequences together with the appropriate flanking\nprimers. The presence of a DNA fragment indicated that the\nclones were indeed single crossover integrants, while the size was\ndiagnostic of at which homology arm (LHA or RHA) recombi-\nnation had occurred.\nFollowing the isolation of pure single crossover integrants of the\ntwo strains, a single colony was re-streaked onto minimal medium\nsupplemented with FOA and uracil to select for cells in which the\nintegrated plasmid had excised. The isolated FOA resistant\ncolonies were then screened by PCR using primers that anneal\nto the upstream and the downstream sequence of the respective\ntarget. DNA products of the predicted size were subjected to\nSanger sequencing to confirm their genotype.\nCwp84 Analysis Methods\nS-layer extracts from the WT, mutant and complemented\nstrains were prepared by the glycin acid method [44]. Proteins\nwere separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a PVDF\nmembrane for immunoblotting. Blocking of the membrane was\nfollowed by incubation with either anti-Cwp84 (1/2,000 dilution)\nor anti-HMW-SLP (1/10,000 dilution). Washing was done as\npreviously described [45], and bound antibodies were detected\nusing goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G alkaline phosphatase\nconjugate (1/20,000 dilution; Sigma) with the substrates nitroblue\ntetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate (Sigma).\nAnti-HMW-SLP antibodies were a kind gift from Pr.
