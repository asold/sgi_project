It \ninvolves posing a hypothesis, collecting data through \nobservation and experimentation, and analyzing and \ninterpreting the results to reach a conclusion. Hence it \nhelps to ensure that research is objective, replicable, and \nbased on empirical evidence. In the field of epidemiol-\nogy, the scientific method is essential for conducting rig-\norous and transparent studies that can accurately address \npublic health issues. As in many other types of research, \nin a typical epidemiologic study, the general flowchart of \n * Francesco Sanmarchi \n francesco.sanmarchi@studio.unibo.it\n1 Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, Alma \nMater Studiorum – University of Bologna, Via San Giacomo \n12, 40126 Bologna, Italy\n2 Department of Economics and Law, University of Macerata, \nMacerata, Italy\n3 STLab, Institute for Cognitive Sciences and Technologies \n(ISTC)-CNR, Roma, Italy\n4 Department of Italian and Supranational Public Law, \nUniversity of Milan, Milan, Italy\n5 Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY, USA\n6 Present Address: Department of Molecular \nand Developmental Medicine, University of Siena, Siena, \nItaly\n1762 Journal of Public Health (2024) 32:1761–1796\n1 3\nthe scientific method process (Elm et al. 2008) includes \nidentifying a research question, conducting a literature \nreview, designing the study, collecting and analyzing \ndata, and interpreting the results and implications.\nTherefore, given the importance and complexity of \nthis process, it appears essential to define shared rules, \nstandards, and methodologies to guide the conduct of \nstudies and mitigate the risk of misconduct or errors. In \nother words, it is crucial that epidemiological studies \nare conducted transparently and rigorously, following \nacknowledged guidelines. The importance of this has \nbeen underlined by many authors (Adami et al. 2011 ; \nAlba et al. 2020; Arroyave et al. 2021) and led to the \ndevelopment of the most widely used guidelines glob-\nally: the STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational \nstudies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement and guide-\nlines. The STROBE guidelines provide a framework for \nthe transparent reporting of observational studies, ensur -\ning that the study's sections (introduction, methods, \nresults, etc.) are accurately and thoroughly reported (Elm \net al. 2008). Adhering to the STROBE guidelines can \nincrease the reliability and reproducibility of the study, \nas well as facilitate the critical appraisal and synthesis \nof the evidence (Elm et al. 2008).\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly growing field \nwith numerous applications in a variety of fields (Dwivedi \net al. 2021). Among these, one where AI has the potential \nto make a significant impact is clinical research and epide-\nmiology, where it could revolutionize the way these fields \noperate and significantly improve our understanding and \nmanagement of public health and healthcare management \nissues. Both fields rely on the collection and analysis of \nlarge amounts of data, making them well-suited for the \napplication of AI technologies (Thiébaut et al. 2018 ; Topol \n2019). One aspect in which AI has yet to show its potential \nis the overall support for conducting epidemiological stud-\nies. Given the complexity of epidemiological studies, and \nthe increasingly present need to speed up and streamline \ntheir execution—while preserving scientific quality and \nintegrity—it appears necessary to study applications of AI \nin supporting the overall conduct of epidemiological stud-\nies, i.e., the support for study design, data analysis, and \ninterpretation of results. Both the tools and the studies that \ntest and validate them are scarce in this field, and some \npotentially revolutionary tools, namely AI-based trans-\nformers, have only recently been introduced (Castelvecchi \n2022; Graham 2022; Stokel-Walker 2022).\nChatGPT and AI‑based transformers\nIn recent years, techniques based on deep learning are \ndriving the AI revolution. Among them, transform-\ners (Abdel-Aty and Gould 2022; Dai et al. 2021) show \nprominent results in several applications. A transformer \nis a type of neural network architecture that was intro-\nduced in the paper “Attention is All You Need” by \nVaswani and colleagues in 2017 (Vaswani et al. 2017). \nThe transformer architecture is a type of deep learning \nmodel that adopts the mechanism of self-attention and is \nparticularly adept at processing sequential data such as \nmachine translation, language modeling, and text clas-\nsification. The transformer model incorporates attention \nmechanisms to weigh the significance of various parts \nof the input and output sequences, enabling it to effec-\ntively capture long-range dependencies and generate \nmore coherent text.\nChat-Generative Pre-training Transformer (Chat-\nGPT) is a recently developed AI model which stands for \n“controlled hierarchical generative transformer” (Cahan \nand Treutlein 2023). It is a machine learning algorithm \ncapable of generating high-quality scientific text (Brown \net al. 2020) that was developed by a team of researchers \nat OpenAI and has received significant attention in the \nscientific community due to its impressive performance \nand potential applications. AI-based transformers, such \nas ChatGPT, may represent a significant advance in the \nfield of AI and could have the potential to impact the \nway scientific research is conducted and communicated. \nHowever, there are also several potential drawbacks to \ntheir use for scientific research and scientific publishing, \nparticularly in public health and epidemiology, and their \nuse to support researchers in conducting epidemiological \nstudies has not yet been studied.\nAim of the study\nThe aim of this study is to shed light and describe how \nAI-based transformer models can help a researcher in \nthe various steps of an epidemiological study. To do \nthis, we used the OpenAI ChatGPT to partially simulate \nan epidemiological study, reformulating the STROBE \nframework into a list of questions to be answered by the \ntransformer itself. We then qualitatively evaluated the \ncoherence and relevance of the transformer’s outputs and \ndiscussed the pros and cons of this innovation in the field \nof epidemiology.\nMethods\nIn this exploratory study, we assessed how ChatGPT \ncould support an epidemiological study. To do this, we \nfirst chose a study to be used as a basis for the simulation \nand extracted the research question and the specific aim. \nWe then relied on the STROBE checklist as a basis for \n1763Journal of Public Health (2024) 32:1761–1796 \n1 3\nformulating the questions to be posed to ChatGPT. Spe-\ncifically, we asked ChatGPT to transform each STROBE \nchecklist item into a question/prompt for itself. We then \nasked the transformer to answer the questions, to provide \nsupport to the researcher in conducting the epidemiologi-\ncal study. Each specific answer was evaluated by three \nindependent senior researchers in terms of coherence and \nrelevance for the purposes of conducting the epidemio-\nlogical study.\nWhen formulating the various prompts, we used the \nselected study as a guideline (Subramanian and Kumar \n2021). This study by Subramanian and Kumar (2021) ana-\nlyzed the relationship between the percentage of the popu-\nlation fully vaccinated and new cases of COVID-19 in 68 \ncountries. The study used publicly available COVID-19 \ndata for cross-country analysis. We chose this type of study \nbecause of its relatively simple design and straightforward \ninterpretation.\nStarting from this article, we extracted the aim of the \nstudy, considering this as a purely human activity related \nto human curiosity to ask questions and to transform them \ninto research questions. The aim of the study served as the \nbasis for contextualizing the use of AI-based transformers \nand demonstrating their potential usefulness in supporting \nthe conduct of an epidemiological study.\nUsing STROBE recommendations prospectively\nThe STROBE guidelines are a set of recommendations \nfor reporting observational studies, including cohort, \ncase–control, and cross-sectional studies. These guide-\nlines provide a framework for transparent and complete \nreporting of the design, conduct, and results of an obser -\nvational study, with the aim of improving the quality and \ntransparency of the research and minimizing biases and \nconfounding factors which can affect the validity and \nreliability of the results.\nThe STROBE guidelines can also be used prospec-\ntively when conducting an epidemiologic study. By fol-\nlowing the STROBE guidelines during the design and \nconduct of the study, researchers can ensure that the \nstudy is conducted in a transparent and rigorous man-\nner and that the results of the study are accurately and \nclearly reported.\nThe STROBE guidelines provide specific recommen-\ndations for the reporting of various aspects of the study, \nsuch as the study design, the sampling and recruitment \nof participants, the measurement of exposures and out-\ncomes, and the analysis and interpretation of the results.\nChatGPT\nGPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a third-\ngeneration, autoregressive language model that uses \ndeep learning to produce human-like text developed by \nOpenAI. It is designed to generate human-like text and \nengage in conversation with users naturally and intui-\ntively. To train the GPT model, researchers at OpenAI \nfed it a large dataset of human-generated text and uti-\nlized the model to predict the next word in the sequence. \nThe model was then fine-tuned using backpropagation, \na technique that involves adjusting the model's weights \nand biases to minimize the error between the predicted \noutput and the actual output.\nAfter the model was trained, it was able to generate \nhuman-like text by predicting the next word in a sequence \nbased on the context provided by the previous words. The \nmodel can be fine-tuned for specific tasks, such as trans-\nlation or question-answering, by training it on a dataset \nspecific to that task.\nIt is worth noting that ChatGPT, a variant of GPT \nspecifically designed for generating human-like text in a \nconversational context such as chatbots or virtual assis-\ntants, is not the same as GPT. While ChatGPT is trained \non a dataset of human conversation and is able to gener -\nate text that is appropriate for use in a chat or messaging \ncontext, the underlying technology and principles of how \nChatGPT works are the same as those of GPT.\nOne of the key features of ChatGPT is its ability to \ngenerate text that is coherent and follows the structure \nand style of scientific articles. It has been trained on large \ndatasets by using 175 billion parameters on Microsoft’s \nAzure AI supercomputer and has learned to generate text \nthat is similar to human-written scientific text in terms \nof grammar, style, and content. This makes it a valuable \ntool for researchers who need to generate large amounts \nof scientific text, such as descriptions of experimental \nmethods and results, summaries of research findings, or \nreview articles (Radford et al. 2019).\nThe use of ChatGPT for supporting the conduction \nof the study\nFirst, we identified the purpose of the study as follows: \n[To examine the relationship between the percentage of \npopulation fully vaccinated and the incidence of new \nCOVID-19 cases in a given population, and to assess \nthe impact of vaccination on the incidence of COVID-19 \ncases.]\n1764 Journal of Public Health (2024) 32:1761–1796\n1 3\nTo maximize the use of ChatGPT, we adopted the \nSTROBE framework, translating its main items/recommen-\ndations into prospective questions for the AI transformer. To \nstandardize the use of the transformer as much as possible, \nwe followed the process listed below:\nSTROBE item > question/prompt for ChatGPT > adapta-\ntion to the simulated research questions > final answer\nFor each STROBE recommendation, we asked the trans-\nformer (on December 19–23, 2022) the following question:\n“Transform the following recommendation from the \nSTROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational \nStudies in Epidemiology) guidelines into a question for \nChatGPT. Recommendation: [STROBE recommendation]”\nThis provided us Answer#1. Then, the next step was the \nspecific question:\n“[Answer#1]+[The study has the following aim: To exam-\nine the relationship between the percentage of popula-\ntion fully vaccinated and the incidence of new COVID-19 \ncases in a given population, and to assess the impact of \nvaccination on the incidence of COVID-19 cases]\nExpert assessment\nWe assessed the outputs of the transformer by using human anno-\ntators to rate the quality and relevance of the model's responses. \nThis was accomplished through a process called “human evalu-\nation,” in which annotators (NN, FT, AB) were asked to rate the \nresponses produced by the model on a 1-to-5-point Likert scale. \nThe annotators were asked to consider factors such as the coher-\nence of the response and its relevance to the prompt.\nGiven that there are no standardized questions that are \nspecifically designed to evaluate the quality and relevance of \nthe responses produced by ChatGPT or any other language \nmodel in terms of coherence and relevance, we evaluated \nthe outputs by asking the expert annotators to consider the \nfollowing questions:\n1. Is the response coherent and well-formed, or is it difficult to \nunderstand? (where 5 is the maximum level of coherence)\n2. Is the response relevant and informative, or is it lacking in \nsubstance? (where 5 is the maximum level of relevance)\nFor each STROBE recommendation, we formulated a \nprompt for ChatGPT contextualizing it with the aim of the \nstudy by Subramanian and Kumar (2021). Each response to \nthe prompts was then evaluated by domain experts to assess \nits consistency and relevance.\nResults\nThe STROBE checklist includes a list of 35 recommenda-\ntions (Table S1). From these recommendations we derived \n35 specific questions for ChatGPT. Three domain experts \nevaluated the answers independently using two coherence \nand relevance scores (Table  1). The mean scores were het-\nerogeneous. On average, for the coherence scores, the overall \nmean score was 3.6 out of 5.0, and for relevance it was 3.3 \nout of 5.0.\nFor example, item #9 (“What should be included in the \ndefinition of outcomes, exposures, predictors, potential \nconfounders, and effect modifiers in an observational \nstudy, and how should diagnostic criteria be provided, \nif applicable, according to the STROBE guidelines?”), \nin the Methods section, received a very satisfactory \nresponse in terms of both coherence (5.0/5.0) and rele-\nvance (5.0/5.0); therefore, the responses given were rated \nvery positively (“According to the STROBE guidelines, \nin order to clearly define all outcomes, exposures, pre -\ndictors, potential confounders, and effect modifiers in \nyour observational study, you should provide detailed \ndescriptions of each of these components. Outcomes: In \nthis study, the outcome would be the incidence of new \nCOVID-19 cases in a given population. You should spec-\nify how you will measure the incidence of COVID-19 \ncases (e.g., number of new cases per 100,000 popula -\ntion), and provide any relevant diagnostic criteria for \nCOVID-19 (e.g., symptoms, test results). Exposures: The \nexposure in this study would be the percentage of the \npopulation that is fully vaccinated. You should specify \nhow you will measure the percentage of the population \nthat is fully vaccinated (e.g., number of individuals who \nhave received both doses of the vaccine), and provide \nany relevant information on the specific vaccine(s) used. \nPredictors: The predictor in this study would be the per -\ncentage of the population that is fully vaccinated. [...]”.\nSimilarly, the answer to item #10, Methods section, was \nalso rated very positively (“What should be included in the \ndescription of sources of data and methods of assessment \nfor each variable of interest in an observational study, \nand how should comparability of assessment methods be \ndescribed if there is more than one group, according to the \nSTROBE guidelines?”), and received a satisfactory response \nin terms of both coherence (4.7/5.0) and relevance (4.7/5.0). \nHere, too, in the opinion of the evaluators, the transformer \nresponse was complete and adequate (“According to the \nSTROBE guidelines, in order to provide a clear and trans-\nparent description of the sources of data and methods of \nassessment for each variable of interest in your observa-\ntional study, you should include the following information: \nFor each variable of interest (e.g., percentage of population \n1765Journal of Public Health (2024) 32:1761–1796 \n1 3Table 1  Final Q&A and respective scores\nQuestion # Question for ChatGPT contextualized/adapted to the simulated research \nquestion\nFinal Answer Mean score: \nCoherence\nMean score: \nRelevance\n1 What are the guidelines for indicating the study design with a commonly \nused term in the title or abstract, according to the STROBE guidelines?\nHow can I effectively explain the scientific background and rationale for \nmy observational study in the introduction?

We used an observational study \nthat analyzes publicly available data to investigate the \nrelationship between the percentage of population fully \nvaccinated and new COVID-19 cases. It is important to \nnote that we started from the premise that while AI can \npotentially assist in reproducing a study, the research \nquestion, the aim of the study, and all the aspects of \noriginality should remain the sole domain of humans. \nTherefore, we began our simulation by using a research \nquestion and aim of the study devised by a human.\nAfter ChatGPT had answered to all the STROBE rec-\nommendations, we asked independent experts to qualita-\ntively evaluate the coherence and relevance of the trans-\nformer’s outputs. In the last few months, these innovative \nsystems have proven to be fast and intuitive and an impor -\ntant support for researchers. However, the coherence, rel-\nevance, and even the correctness of their answers is not \nalways clear, and there are currently no studies, to our \nknowledge, that critically analyze the use of these tools in \nepidemiological research (O’Connor and ChatGPT 2023). \nThe choice of the STROBE checklist and the method of \nturning its recommendations into questions for ChatGPT \nrepresents an attempt to standardize and make our analy -\nsis as reproducible as possible. In fact, by following the \nSTROBE guidelines, researchers can help ensure that \ntheir results are accurately and clearly reported, which \ncan help other researchers and policymakers understand \nand interpret the results of the study. This is particularly \nimportant in the field of epidemiology, as the results of \nepidemiological studies can have important implications \nfor public health policy and practice.\nFrom the results of our analysis, we found that ChatGPT \ncan be a valuable support for researchers, both experienced \nand inexperienced, in setting up an epidemiological study, \nparticularly observational, following internationally recog-\nnized guidelines and standards. The average score attrib-\nuted by experts to the responses given by the AI-based \ntransformer was above 3.5 over 5, but with a fair amount \nof variability among responses to individual outputs. This \nis consistent with suggestions and preliminary analyses in \nthe limited literature available on these tools (Castelvec-\nchi 2022; Graham 2022; Huh 2023; Stokel-Walker 2022), \nwhich indicate that AI-based transformers are beginning \nto be used but with some skepticism, partly due to their \nsuboptimal ability to respond adequately, in terms of con-\nsistency and relevance, to questions posed by domain expert \nresearchers. Therefore, it seems essential that users of these \ntools have knowledge about the subject matter and a critical \nmindset when evaluating their outputs. Blindly accepting \nthe answers of these tools may still be too great a risk to the \nintegrity of science and thus human society.\n1786 Journal of Public Health (2024) 32:1761–1796\n1 3\nparadigm. It seems more likely that, with the support \nof these systems, we will move towards a model where \nthe researcher can focus more on the study and experi-\nmental phase than on methodological problems and \nquestions.\nAnother risk associated with the use of AI in scien-\ntific research is the potential for fraudulent manipu-\nlation of large-scale scientific publications. An exam-\nple of this is related to the scientific publisher IOP, \nwhich retracted as many as 850 articles in 2022 after a \nresearcher at the University of Cambridge in the United \nKingdom discovered that many of them contained non-\nsensical phrases produced by artificial intelligence pro-\ngrams trying to avoid anti-plagiarism software. These \nphrases were repeated a staggering number of times \nin different articles from different groups. When IOP \nbegan investigating, the editor found other similarities \nthat suggested the articles came from a so-called sci-\nentific paper mill, a company that produces and sells \npseudo-articles for a fee.\nThe use of AI-based solutions capable of generat -\ning text in scientific research also brings with it many \nlegal implications. However, it is beyond the scope of \nthis article to address in detail each and every possible \nlegal issue that may arise when using AI tools to gen-\nerate text to be published in scientific studies. For our \npurposes, we can highlight that one of the main con-\ncerns is the issue of plagiarism and copyright infringe -\nment. AI-generated text may be similar or identical \nto existing copyrighted material, which could lead to \nlegal issues for researchers and their institutions. It is \nimportant for researchers to be aware of these potential \nissues and take steps to ensure that their work does not \nviolate any copyright laws. Using anti-plagiarism soft-\nware to evaluate the generated text can be a helpful tool \nin reducing the risk of publishing non-original text.\nWe look forward to the development and refinement \nof these systems, which will be helpful in preserv -\ning scientific integrity and ethics and will be of great \nassistance to publishers and other stakeholders. These \nsoftware programs are designed to detect similarities \nbetween a given text and existing material. They can \nidentify potential instances of plagiarism or copyright \ninfringement, allowing researchers to make necessary \nchanges before publishing their work. It is important \nto note, however, that anti-plagiarism software may not \ncatch all instances of plagiarism. Therefore, it is impor -\ntant for researchers to also use their own judgment and \nto carefully review the AI-generated text for any poten-\ntial instance of plagiarism or copyright infringement.\nIt is also interesting to note that the researchers rated \nsome ChatGPT outputs very positively and others very nega-\ntively. Notably, both the responses rated very positively and \nthose rated very negatively were in the methods part. This \nsuggests that, when properly queried, the transformer may \nprovide more appropriate answers in the methodological and \ndata analysis and reporting domains, which were found to \nhave the highest level of consistency and relevance.\nEven in the introduction part, this AI-based trans-\nformer can be useful in placing a study in context. As lit-\nerature has shown (O’Connor and ChatGPT 2023), these \nsystems can function as true “scientific writers” and can \nquickly and adequately contribute to the writing of entire \nparagraphs. However, our study found that the responses \nto STROBE recommendations related to the introduction/\nbackground and discussion/interpretation paragraphs of \nscientific articles did not receive high scores, indicat-\ning that the tool is not yet fully adequate to support (or \npotentially replace) researchers in this part of scientific \narticles, particularly in epidemiological studies. A pos -\nsible explanation for this drop in performance may be \nrelated to the ChatGPT training data. Specifically, the \nAI-based transformer was not specifically trained on \nscientific articles. This issue may be partially addressed \nby specific training or fine-tuning (Brown et al. 2020 ; \nRaffel et al. 2020).\nOur analysis showed the ability of AI-based transform -\ners to generate answers and human-like text, which could \npotentially be used to conduct epidemiological studies or \nwrite research articles. This could potentially save time and \nresources for researchers, as these activities can be time-\nconsuming and labor-intensive.\nHowever, there are also several potential drawbacks to \nthe use of AI-based transformers for scientific research \n(King and ChatGPT 2023; O’Connor and ChatGPT \n2023). One concern is the risk of bias in the data that \nare used to train these systems. If the data used to train \nthe AI system are biased, the system may produce biased \nresults or make biased recommendations. This could \nhave serious consequences, particularly in the field of \npublic health and epidemiology, where decisions about \ninterventions and policies may be based on the results \nof research.\nAnother concern that is often reported in the critical \nanalysis of these systems (Else 2023; Graham 2023), is \nthe potential for AI-based transformers to replace human \nresearchers, potentially leading to job loss and the deval-\nuation of human expertise (Graham 2022). However, \nour assessment suggests a possible shift in the “study-\nexperiment-analysis-results-writing-publication” \n1787Journal of Public Health (2024) 32:1761–1796 \n1 3\nAnother legal implication in using AI-based solutions \nfor text generation in scientific research is the accuracy \nof the information. As mentioned earlier, AI-generated \ntext may contain errors or inaccuracies that can have \nserious consequences for the scientific community. \nFor example, if an AI-generated article is published in \na reputable journal and it contains inaccurate informa-\ntion, it could lead to other researchers basing their work \non flawed data. Therefore, it is crucial for researchers \nto thoroughly check that the final product is sound and \nreliable.\nIn short, it is important to stress that even if AI tools \nare used to generate text, the responsibility for the \nresearch still lies with the humans to whom the work is \nattributed. This means that researchers and their institu-\ntions are responsible for ensuring that their work is legally \ncompliant and that it does not infringe on any copyright \nlaws or contain any inaccuracies. This highlights the need \nfor careful consideration and adherence to ethical and \nlegal guidelines when utilizing AI in scientific research.\nLimits of the study\nIt is important to note that, being an ML algorithm, Chat-\nGPT's answers may differ if re-run after some time. This \nrepresents a limitation in the reproducibility of the results \nof our study.\nFurthermore, there is no single way to formulate ques-\ntions to the transformer; different questions, even on \nthe same topic, produce different answers, which may \nbe more or less consistent and relevant to the objective \nof the analysis, representing a limitation of the study. \nHowever, in the context of the present study, we tried \nto standardize this process as much as possible by start-\ning with STROBE recommendations and directly asking \nthe AI-based transformer to adapt them into prompts for \nitself. This may have at least partially mitigated the risk \nof variability.\nConclusions\nIn this exploratory study, we evaluated the coherence \nand relevance of an open AI-based transformer’s answers \nregarding questions extracted and reformulated from the \nSTROBE recommendations for observational studies.\nFrom our assessment, the transformer can be consid -\nered as a valuable support for researchers, both experi-\nenced and inexperienced, in setting up an epidemiological \nstudy, following internationally recognized guidelines and \nstandards. The average score attributed by experts to the \nresponses given by the AI-based transformer was high, \nbut with a fair amount of variability among responses to \nindividual outputs.\nResponses related to the methods, data analysis, and \nreporting domains and recommendations were found to have \nthe highest level of coherence and relevance, emphasizing \nthat these innovative tools may be useful primarily for meth-\nodological and statistical support, rather than for building \nthe conceptual frameworks of the study and the narrative \nstructure of the paper.\nTherefore, it seems essential that users of these tools have \nknowledge about the subject matter and a critical mindset \nwhen evaluating their outputs. Blindly accepting the answers \nof these tools may pose a serious threat to the ethics and \nintegrity of scientific research, including epidemiology. \nAccordingly, we advocate the necessity for taking a proac-\ntive stance towards this evolving context, in order to ensure \ncareful governance of this inevitable process. Maintaining \nrigor and reliability of scientific research implies establish-\ning a shared, and as much as possible, standardized method \nfor conducting studies, analyzing data, and reporting its \nresults. The potential benefits of AI in scientific research \nare undeniable, but it is crucial that we address the risks, \nand the ethical and legal consequences associated with its \nuse. This requires a collaborative effort between researchers, \npolicymakers, and other stakeholders to define guidelines \nand best practices—and monitor their fulfillment—for the \nethically and legally correct use of AI in scientific research.\n1788 Journal of Public Health (2024) 32:1761–1796\n1 3\nAppendix               Table 2\nTable 2  From STROBE items/recommendation to ChatGPT questions\nQuestion # Original STROBE item/recommendation STROBE item transformed into a question for ChatGPT Answer\n1 *Title and abstract.
