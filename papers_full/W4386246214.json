  "abstract": "Pose estimation plays a crucial role in recognizing and analyzing the postures, actions, and movements of humans and animals using computer vision and machine learning techniques. However, bird pose estimation encounters specific challenges, including bird diversity, posture variation, and the fine granularity of posture. To overcome these challenges, we propose VHR-BirdPose, a method that combines Vision Transformer (ViT) and Deep High-Resolution Network (HRNet) with an attention mechanism. VHR-BirdPose effectively extracts features using Vision Transformer’s self-attention mechanism, which captures global dependencies in the images and allows for better capturing of pose details and changes. The attention mechanism is employed to enhance the focus on bird keypoints, improving the accuracy of pose estimation. By combining HRNet with Vision Transformer, our model can extract multi-scale features while maintaining high-resolution details and incorporating richer semantic information through the attention mechanism. This integration of HRNet and Vision Transformer leverages the advantages of both models, resulting in accurate and robust bird pose estimation. We conducted extensive experiments on the Animal Kingdom dataset to evaluate the performance of VHR-BirdPose. The results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in bird pose estimation. VHR-BirdPose based on bird images is of great significance for the advancement of bird behaviors, ecological understanding, and the protection of bird populations.",
