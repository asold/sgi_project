Introductory theory – motivation\nThe primary cause of space weather are explosions in the Sun\npowered by its strong magnetic ﬁeld which affect man-made\ntechnological infrastructure in space, disturb communications\nand GPS signals and couple through Geomagnetically Induced\nCurrents (GICs for short) with the large-scale high voltage\npower grid. The most well-known case of the impact of\nlarge-scale space weather events on the electric grid is the\n1989 Hydro-Quebec blackout caused by the 13 and 14 March\nsuper storm. Highly acclaimed institutions (like the US\nNational Academy of Sciences 2008 ,t h e UK Royal Society\nof Engineering 2013, etc.) have issued extended reports arguing\nthat space weather super storms may cause trillions of dollars of\ndamage although it is acknowledged that these estimates may\nnot be totally accurate. There is general consensus however that\nspace weather super storms constitute a serious threat. The main\ncause of GICs is the interaction of the geomagnetic ﬁeld with\nthe magnetic ﬁeld carried within CMEs and the surrounding\nbackground magnetised solar wind that is modulated by them.\nThere are several space weather phenomena which tend to\nbe associated with a geomagnetic storm or are caused by a geo-\nmagnetic storm (see Chapman & Ferraro 1930 ). These include:\nSolar Energetic Particle (SEP) events, geomagnetically induced\ncurrents (GICs), ionospheric disturbances which cause radio\nand radar scintillation, disruption of navigation by magnetic\ncompass and auroral displays at much lower latitudes than nor-\nmal. In this article we shall focus on GICs and their effects on\nelectric grids, in particular large transformers. GICs are the\nground level manifestations of space weather (namely geomag-\nnetic storms) and they are driven by the variations of the terres-\ntrial magnetic ﬁeld (temporary disturbances of the earth’s\nmagnetosphere) via Faraday’s Law of Induction.\nOne can brieﬂy describe the emergence of GICs as a six-\nstep process (see Pulkkinen et al. 2001a , 2001b, 2003a,\n2003b, 2003c):\n1. Plasma is ejected from the Sun.\n2. The magnetised plasma structures propagate in the inter-\nplanetary medium (solar wind).\n3. Solar wind interacts with the magnetosphere. Here the\ndominant factor for determining how much Earth is\naffected is the orientation of the solar wind magnetic\nﬁeld. The energy feed into the magnetosphere is highest\nduring strong reconnection of the solar wind and the ter-\nrestrial magnetic ﬁeld. Increased energy ﬂux into the sys-\ntem sets the conditions for dynamic changes in the\nmagnetospheric electric current systems. One of such\nJ.

Magnetosphere-ionosphere interaction. The closure of the\nmagnetospheric currents goes via polar regions of the\nionosphere. Consequently dynamic changes in the mag-\nnetospheric currents couple to the dynamics of the iono-\nsphere. An important class of dynamic variations are\nauroral substorms which are related to loading-unloading\nprocesses in the tail of the magnetosphere (e.g., Kallio\net al. 2000 ). During auroral substorms particles injected\nfrom the tail of the magnetosphere are seen in the iono-\nsphere in terms of auroras and rapid changes in the auro-\nral current systems. Although some of the basic features\nare understood, the details of the storm and substorm pro-\ncesses as well as the storm/substorm relationship are one\nof the most fundamental open questions in the solar-ter-\nrestrial physics (see Kamide & Baumjohann 1993 ;\nKamide 2001 ).\n5. Rapid changes of the ionospheric and magnetospheric\nelectric currents cause variations in the geomagnetic ﬁeld\nwhich, according to Faraday’s law of induction, induce an\nelectric ﬁeld which drives an electric current in the sub-\nsurface region of the Earth. The nature of this geoelectric\nﬁeld depends on the characteristics of the ionospheric-\nmagnetospheric source and on the conductivity structure\nof the Earth. As a rule of thumb, the magnitude of the\ngeoelectric ﬁeld increases with increasing time deriva-\ntives of the ground magnetic ﬁeld and with decreasing\nground conductivity.\n6. Finally, the geoelectric ﬁeld drives currents within con-\nductors at and below the surface of the Earth. The mag-\nnitude and distribution of the currents are dependent on\nthe topology and electrical characteristics of the system\nunder investigation. The induced currents ﬂowing in tech-\nnological systems on the ground are the GICs.\nFrom steps 3 and 4 above it is expected that the greatest\nGIC problems occur at high latitudes in or near the auroral\nzones. In these areas the geomagnetic storms are most intense\nand frequent since the ionospheric source is typically a localised\nelectrojet. Countries at mid-latitude, such as Greece (latitude\napproximately 35/C176N–41/C176N), are located far from the magnetic\npole and do not experience the same severity of geomagnetic\ndisturbances as Canada or Scandinavia. Greece is also far from\nthe equator and hence one does not expect severe effects due to\nthe equatorial electrojet. GICs and their potential threat to net-\nwork integrity are relatively unknown at mid-latitudes. Until\nrecently it was believed that electricity networks in mid-latitude\nregions are not affected by GICs. Our research addresses this\nassumption, and provides insight into the incidence of GICs\nand the performance of the Greek electricity transmission\nnetwork.\nThe effects of GICs on transformers are brieﬂy the follow-\ning: GICs superimpose a direct current onto the AC waveform.\nYet although this direct current is usually rather small, it can\nshift the ( B-H) curve outside the linear design operation region\nresulting in highly distorted output waveform, very high mag-\nnetic ﬂuxes and half-cycle saturation (see, e.g., Bossi et al.\n1983; Takasu et al. 1994 ; Minhas et al. 1999 ; Price 2002 ).\nThe magnetic ﬂux leakage from the core of the transformer\nmay lead to overheating, gassing, shutdown and even\ncatastrophic failure. Moreover, the distorted output wave form\ncan create higher harmonics, can cause the triggering of the pro-\ntective relays (Buchholz, etc.) and various control assets may be\nswitched out. In addition to all the above the magnetising cur-\nrent can get outside the design speciﬁcations leading to\nincreased V Ar consumption and voltage instability. Let’s\ndescribe the situation with slightly more details.\nGICs are driven by the variation of the (terrestrial) magnetic\nﬁeld, so they are characterised by slow changes. A transformer\ncore saturates under GIC bias, causing it to operate in the extre-\nmely non-linear portion of the core steel magnetisation ( B-H)\ncurve. This quasi-direct current (GIC) ﬂowing through a trans-\nformer offsets the power frequency magnetisation curve so that\nthe magnetic circuit operates asymmetrically on the ( B-H)\ncurve. Transformers are designed to operate in the linear portion\nof the curve with only a small magnetising current, without\napproaching the non-linear regions of core saturation. Even\nsmall GICs can produce sufﬁcient offset for the transformer\nto reach half-cycle saturation of the ac current that is in the\nsame direction as the GICs. As the core saturates the permeabil-\nity tends to 1 and the ﬂux ﬁlls the whole space of the winding,\nso it is very different from the ﬂux distribution under normal\nconditions. Normal leakage ﬂux is controlled by non-magnetic\n(stainless steel or aluminium) shields, shunts or cheek plates,\nthe dimensions of which are critical for controlling eddy current\nlosses and heating. Under normal conditions, with most ﬂux in\nthe magnetic core, the non-magnetic plates carry little ﬂux and\ngenerate only small losses. Under half-wave core saturation, the\nlosses in some parts of the leakage ﬂux shields may increase\nsigniﬁcantly, causing localised heating.\nHalf-wave saturation also increases the magnetising current\nand distorts the magnetisation current waveform (see, e.g.,\nTakasu et al. 1994 ). The distorted magnetising current has\nharmonics that correlate well with the GIC. Without adequate\ncontrol of the ﬂux under saturation conditions, local heating\nin parts of the transformer may not be cooled effectively, lead-\ning to rapid temperature increase. The intensity of overheating\ndepends on the saturation ﬂux paths, cooling ﬂow and the ther-\nmal condition or loading of the transformer. Overheating causes\nthe breakdown of oil and paper insulation, leading to gassing\nthat can be detected and analysed by dissolved gas analysis\n(DGA).\nWhen a large number of transformers experience saturation\ndue to GICs, the system’s reactive power demand increases sig-\nniﬁcantly compared with the total load supplied by the trans-\nformer. Reactive power demands of this magnitude can cause\nsevere system voltage excursions. At the same time, the change\nin size of the ferromagnetic material (magnetostriction) between\nsaturated and unsaturated states at 100 times a second (at\n50 Hz) causes heating, noise and mechanical vibration damage,\nthus possibly leading to many ‘‘mechanical’’ failures (e.g., bro-\nken switch axes) on top of the ‘‘electric’’ failures.\nIn the scientiﬁc literature (see, e.g., Coetzee & Gaunt 2007 ;\nGaunt & Kohen 2009 ) there have been reports that GICs can\ncause many types of failures on transformers like: Insulation\nfailure, tank shunting effects, local heating, rapid temperature\nincrease causing the breakdown of the oil and paper insulation,\nthus leading to gassing (which can be analysed by dissolved gas\nanalysis). The DGA records of transformers in S. Africa for\nexample indicate that deterioration continues after the initial\ndamage caused by GICs, affected by transformer loading and\npossibly other stresses (see Koen & Gaunt 2002 ). A transformer\nmight fail only months after the initial damageand, unless\nJ. Space Weather Space Clim. 3 (2013) A32\nA32-p2\nfrequent DGA samples have been taken, could appear to fail for\n‘‘unknown causes’’ or a subsequent stress incident. Failure of\ntransformers is often ascribed to damage of internal insulation\nby external overvoltages or network faults. Other signiﬁcant\ncauses of transformer failures are settling in and ageing. Copper\nsulphide formation in transformers or reactors with corrosive\noils has recently become a concern. The coincident onset of\ngas generation in widely separated transformers of different\nages, the relative ‘‘exposure’’ of the transformers to GICs,\nand the similarities between the nature of damage and its timing\nall indicate that the systemwide effect of GICs is likely to be a\nmore signiﬁcant initiator of the failures than overloading, over-\nvoltages, system faults, copper sulphide formation or manufac-\nturing defects. Some of these other factors may contribute to\nfailure by weakening transformers and explain why some failed\nand others did not. The damage in all the transformers inspected\nappears to be initiated by local overheating. The DGA results\nare consistent with low temperature degradation of insulation.\nThe levels of dissolved gases are below levels generally consid-\nered to be signiﬁcant, and this is consistent with localised over-\nheating.\nThe nature of faults caused by low temperature local over-\nheating in windings is such that much of the evidence at the site\nof a fault would be obscured by subsequent disruptive failure. It\nis unlikely, therefore, that inspections after a disruptive fault\nwill identify evidence of low temperature local overheating at\nthe fault position. Unless overheating caused by leakage ﬂux\nestablished by GICs is speciﬁcally considered, which is unli-\nkely based on current knowledge of the problem, GICs will\nnot be reported as a cause of faults. Does damage caused by\nlow temperature local overheating always lead to failure and,\nif so, how quickly? Once core saturation by the GIC is\nremoved, thermally damaged paper insulation will be less\nrobust than before the event. Another mechanism of further\ndamage must be considered, such as by leakage currents, partial\ndischarge or reduced heat transfer through the damaged paper,\ncausing further local heating to an extent that degradation con-\ntinues. Such mechanisms could explain why gas generation and\nDGA levels decrease when the transformer loading is reduced.\nEventually, depending on the extent of the initial damage, the\npresence of air and water in the transformer, and operating\nstresses, the damaged insulation in a small area will fail, even\nif the DGA levels are signiﬁcantly below those usually indicat-\ning incipient failure. However, since the initial damage and the\nsubsequent operating conditions are variable, the breakdown\nlevel or likelihood of failure is difﬁcult to determine . In the\ncases reported in S. Africa and elsewhere, the DGA indicated\nthe onset or increase of damage coincident with a severe storm.\nThereafter, some transformers failed quite quickly (after a few\ndays from the incident – this is one of the reasons for the choice\nof 3 and 7 days time scales after a storm for immediate failures\nin Section 6 – others took months, and some might survive until\ngradual deterioration, a severe system fault, overvoltage or\nanother GIC event causes the damage to be extended to the\npoint of failure. Accordingly, any transformer exhibiting an\nincrease in levels of dissolved gases that indicate paper degra-\ndation after a geomagnetic event should be considered as dis-\ntressed. The nature or location of GIC initiated damage is not\nthe same for all the transformers. Designs differ and transform-\ners made to the same design are not always manufactured iden-\ntically. Similar GICs through similar transformers might cause\nslightly different patterns of leakage ﬂux, and the weakest part\nof one transformer’s insulation might differ from another’s. The\nmost likely failure point will be where leakage ﬂux creates a\ncondition that exceeds the local cooling capacity. In extreme\ncases, part of the tank or core might melt, but in most cases\ndamage might only be observed in a winding or a lead, as in\nthe cases reported here. The GICs should not be thought of\nas a single cause of a fault, but as a stress that exposes relative\nweaknesses, which become localised hot spots and eventually\nlead to failure. Thus in many cases these failures can be attrib-\nuted to ‘‘ageing’’ or ‘‘manufacturing defects’’.\nGICs have cumulative and long term effects on transform-\ners. Extreme GIC events do not occur only at the peak of or late\nin a solar cycle and ﬁnal failure may not easily be linked to the\nsolar cycle or a speciﬁc storm. Yet based on these responses to\nGICs, it would be expected that transformer failures should\nincrease during periods following geomagnetic storms. Such\na trend is evident for example from an analysis of failures of\nlarge transformers, all over 230 kV , in S. Africa and N. Amer-\nica. The same holds true in our case (Greece) where we observe\nan important increase in the number of failures 7 days after a\nstorm.\nThere are some interesting implications for the analysis and\nreporting of failures. Excluding GICs from consideration results\nin all faults being ascribed to other causes. Subsequent analysis\nof fault data would show that GICs are not reported as a cause\nof faults, further obscuring the possible underlying processes of\ndamage initiation. One of the main motivations for this research\nis that utility engineers (PPC or IPTO in our case here concern-\ning Greece) should start recognising that a number of trans-\nformer failures are due to GICs, based on evidence available\nfrom storm occurrences, network analysis, incident reports\nand damage inspections. This in turn can attach liability to\ntransformer suppliers with less access to the relevant data. A\nmanufacturer that could show that failures might be associated\nwith GICs, but that GICs were not considered or identiﬁed in\nspeciﬁcations or incident reports by the utility engineers, could\navoid or reduce any liability for damage. Avoiding damage by\nGICs requires that transformers be designed and built so that\nleakage ﬂux resulting from saturation will not cause local\noverheating.\nThe second motivation for this work comes from mitiga-\ntion: Mitigation can be implemented by suitable ﬂux shunts,\nadequate clearances between the tank and core, aligning con-\nductors so that leakage ﬂux does not produce signiﬁcant eddy\ncurrents, improving the cooling where local heating might be\nexpected, and other techniques already used by manufacturers.\nTransformers have been designed, built and tested to survive\nsaturation by high GICs. Some utilities already specify that\ntransformers must withstand the effects of large GICs, with\ncompliance demonstrated by ﬁnite element modelling of the\nﬂux produced. Design reviews for transformers in less exposed\nsituations could similarly take into account the effects of GICs\nat levels appropriate to the network. Temporary network recon-\nﬁguration can be used to reduce the magnitudes of GICs, and\nmight be a suitable way to reduce transformer stress in net-\nworks that are only infrequently exposed to severe geomagnetic\nstorms, such as outside the auroral zones. Where many trans-\nformers are already installed without speciﬁed GIC capability,\ntemporary network reconﬁguration during storms may be the\nmost effective short term mitigation procedure. Factors to be\nconsidered include the reliability of the reconﬁgured network,\nthe costs of modiﬁed power despatch, the transformer risk asso-\nciated with the redistributed GICs, and the conditions under\nwhich reconﬁguration will be implemented. Long term mitiga-\ntion can be achieved by installing series of capacitors in long\ntransmission lines to block the quasi-DC GICs, with possible\nI.P. Zois: Solar activity and transformer failures in the Greek national electric grid\nA32-p3\nbeneﬁts for power ﬂow capacity or even with GIC-blocking\nequipment.\n2. Transformer failures in Greece – the collection of\nthe relevant data\nThe Greek national electric grid contains 67 mega transformers\n(400 kV) and 501 large transformers (150 kV) plus a number\nof auxiliary transformers (starting from 15 kV).\nThe Independent Power Transmission Operator (IPTO or\nADMIE in Greek) is the Greek independent power transmission\noperator, a fully subsidiary company of PPC (the Greek Public\nPower Corporation). IPTO provided data for mega and large\ntransformer failures (namely failures for 400 kV and 150 kV\ntransformers) throughout Greece from 1989 to 2010.\nAccording to the IPTO (and PPC) policy a recorded trans-\nformer failure is any transformer malfunction having as a result\nthe transformer shutdown; the duration of the shutdown can be\nanything ranging from 1 min up to complete destruction and\ntotal replacement of the transformer.\nAgain according to IPTO (and PPC) policy, recorded trans-\nformer failures are divided into two categories: These caused by\nhuman errors and all the rest. The former are recorded sepa-\nrately and they are used for personnel training and personnel\nevaluation. IPTO provided data only for the latter (with the\nremark that failures due to human error constitute a negligible\namount). Hence we shall only consider, to begin with, recorded\ntransformer failures caused by any reason except human error.\nGoing through the available data, there are some trans-\nformer failures which are obviously irrelevant to GICs. These\nare failures due to:\nd earthquakes,\nd falling of trees or other objects on the transformer (e.g.,\ndue to strong winds),\nd short circuits due to animals (e.g., in Greece it is rela-\ntively common to have short circuits caused by ferrets\nor even occasionally birds),\nd lightnings,\nd extreme weather conditions (heat or frost).\nThese failures have been excluded from our study. All the\nremaining failures are included, no matter if they are character-\nised as ‘‘mechanical’’ or ‘‘electrical’’ or whatever else. (For\nexample failures due to ‘‘ageing’’ or ‘‘manufacturing defects’’\nare included since there are reports on their relevance – see\nthe previous section.) These failures in the sequel will be called\nsimply transformer failures (TFs). We would like to mention\nthough as an important note that these obviously irrelevant to\nGICs transformer failures are about 10% of the total amount\nof recorded failures hence even if we had included them the sta-\ntistical results would not have been much different. TF were\ngrouped on an annual basis.\nLet us now explain and justify our strategy and methods.\nWe start by exhibiting the problems and limitations: Looking\nat the available data for TF, it is very hard indeed to state\nwhether a speciﬁc failure is explicitly and exclusively due to\nGIC (taking in mind the previous section where we explained\nthat GICs aggravate transformers and can cause cumulative\neffects). In addition to this, there are no devices measuring\nGICs or any other sort of relevant monitoring equipment any-\nwhere in Greece. And ﬁnally, repairing technicians – who are\nthe people who complete the failure reports – admittedly have\nno training or experience whatsoever on GICs and failures\nrelated to them.\nWe tried to overcome these limitations with the following\napproach: First we divided the effects of solar activity onto\ntransformers in two categories: Short term (or immediate)\neffects and long term effects (for the deﬁnition of the immediate\nor short term effects see the next paragraph).\nFor the immediate effects things were a bit complicated.\nOur task was to try to select possible immediate effects of solar\nactivity on transformers by looking at TF data and reports writ-\nten by technicians which are totally unfamiliar with GICs and\nthe problems they create. Given our restrictions described\nabove, what we did then was this: For the period 1989–2010\nfor which we have available data, we picked up the ‘‘stormy\ndays’’, namely days with say Ap /C21 100 (this roughly corre-\nsponds to G2 and higher in the NOAA G-scale). For these\nstormy days then, we counted on how many of them we had\na TF. In addition we counted how many failures we had during\na stormy day or 3 days prior or 3 days after a stormy day; this is\nin order to take into account effects like sudden commence-\nments of storms where rapid variations of the terrestrial mag-\nnetic ﬁeld occur. We did the same for a 7 day period (before\nor after a stormy day). The rationale behind this is that TFs\noccurring during a stormy day (or ‘‘around’’ a stormy day)\nare very much possible to be caused by GICs indeed. Thus\nwe give the relevant frequency (frequency of occurrence of fail-\nures during a stormy day) along with explicit examples which\nwe brieﬂy present and analyse. This provides an answer to the\nquestion of the assessment of the immediate or short term\neffects of solar activity onto transformers.\nThe later, namely long term effects of solar activity onto\ntransformer failures are – in principle at least – perhaps simpler\nto deal with and quantify: We use various analytic and statistical\nmethods, in particular linear and non-linear statistical regression\nand correlation. As an independent variable we use some newly\ndeﬁned long term solar activity index and as a dependent var-\niable we use the annual number of transformer failures. One\nbasic problem we had to overcome here at the very start was\nto create a suitable long term solar activity index since there\nwas no one readily available.\n3. Solar activity (long term indices) data\nIn order to assess-study the long term effects of solar activity on\ntransformers, the idea is to try to statistically correlate transformer\nfailures with solar activity. The subtlety here is that we need some\n‘‘indices’’ with the same time scale for these two groups of data.\nFrom the transformer failures’ side, things are pretty straightfor-\nward, the annual number of transformer failures throughout\nGreece is probably the most reasonable index (counting the num-\nber of transformer failures on a monthly basis may have some\nlogic yet it is not very convenient; any shorter time scale than that,\nweekly, daily or hourly basis, is clearly senseless). On the solar\nactivity side things are not so straightforward. A very reasonable\nindex measuring solar activity is the number of sunspots, given on\nan annual basis. The number of sunspots follows well (in fact\npartly deﬁnes) the 11-year solar activity cycle (bell-shaped\ngraph). The problem with this index (annual number of sunspots)\nthough is that it is ‘‘indirect’’ for our purposes. We are primarily\ninterested in earth affecting solar activity (and not just solar\nactivity in general) and for this purpose the number of sunspots\nis relevant but not directly relevant; for example in sunspot\nJ. Space Weather Space Clim. 3 (2013) A32\nA32-p4\nregions ﬂares or CMEs tend to be created but whether they affect\nthe earth and up to what extend, depends on the size of ﬂare or\nCME, the relative position (direction and magnitude) of the ﬂare\nwith the current position of the earth (sun-earth line). Thus a more\ndirect index should be directly related to the variations of the mag-\nnetic ﬁeld of the earth caused by the ejected plasma from the sun.\nAfter all the creation of GICs (which is what affects transformers)\nis due to the Faraday Law in classical electromagnetism which\nrelates electric ﬁelds and currents with variations of the magnetic\nﬁeld. Now there are indeed certain indices measuring these vari-\nations of the terrestrial magnetic ﬁeld, the most important and\nwell-known ones are the Ap index (and its logarithmic version\nthe Kp index along with some variations) and the Dst index\n(see Broun 1861; Adams 1892; Chapman 1935; Bartels et al.\n1939; Chapman 1952; Kertz 1958, 1964; Akasofu & Chapman\n1964; Cahill 1966 ; Sugiura & Hendricks 1967 ; Frank 1970 ;\nAkasofu & Chapman 1972 ; Fukushima & Kamide 1973 ;\nCrooker & Siscoe 1981 ; Rangarajan 1989 ; Sugiura 1991 ;\nTascione 1994 ; Campbell 2002 ; Carlowicz & Lopez 2002 ).\nThe problem with these indices however is that they are short term\nindices, they are daily planetary averages from about a dozen sta-\ntions on the globe. We need a long term (on an annual basis) index\nof the earth affecting solar activity. So the picture is this: On the\none hand the annual number of sunspots is a good long term index\nof solar activity but it is characterised as indirect for our purpose,\nwhereas on the other hand the Ap and Dst indices are direct but\nshort term indices (see Moos 1910 ; Vestine et al. 1947 ; Hess\n1968; Haymes 1971 ; Rostoker 1972 ; Shelley 1979 ; Langel\net al. 1980 , 1981; Mayaud 1980; Smith et al. 1981 ; Williams\n1980, 1981; Van Allen James 1983 ; Lehtinen & Pirjola 1985 ;\nHamilton et al. 1988; Parks 1991\n; Walt 1994; Kivelson & Russell\n1995). It is not easy to get a direct index out of the number of\nsunspots but there are a number of possibilities to deﬁne some\nlong term (on an annual basis) solar activity indices using the\nAp and Dst data: One can count the number of ‘‘disturbed’’\ndays per year, namely annual number of days with say Ap /C21 40\nand Dst /C20/C0 40. The value 40 was chosen from the NOAA\nBoulder Colorado station scale table and the NOAA Space\nWeather Scale for Geomagnetic Storms (NOAA G-scale): it\nseems a reasonable choice since the A-index is the daily average\nof the equivalent a indices and a value of a = 40 corresponds to\nroughly a situation between G0 and G1 (G0 means no practical\neffects, G1 means minor practical effects on man-made systems\non earth). Table 1 indicates the correspondence between the K-\nindex, the a-index, the variations of the terrestrial magnetic ﬁeld\nDB and the NOAA G-scale.\nThis long term index has the disadvantage that we count the\ndisturbed days but not the severity of the solar storms. Another\noption would be to count the annual sum of the Ap and Dst\nindices, in this case we take into account both the number of\nstorms and their intensity. A third option is to consider the\nannual average of the Ap and Dst indices. The difference\nbetween the annual sum and the annual average is the division\nby 365 (or 366) and for linear models this makes no difference\n(as one can easily check by looking at the relevant formulae)\nbut it does make some (little as we shall see in one example)\ndifference in non-linear models. Our ﬁnal option was to con-\nsider the annual mean of the daily sum of the 3 h K-index of\nthe local Penteli Magnetic Observatory near Athens. This last\noption makes use of local geomagnetic data (and not planetary\naverages like the Ap and Dst).\nIf we restrict our study to linear regression and correlation\n(thus ignoring non-linear phenomena, which is not too bad as\na ﬁrst approximation), it follows easily from the relevant formu-\nlae (mathematical statistics) that instead of studying for exam-\nple the linear correlation between two variables say X and Y,\none can equivalently study their scalar multiples aX and bY\n(where a, b real scalars), the results remain the same (the cor-\nrelation coefﬁcient does not change). In this case if we simply\ndivide the annual sum of Ap and Dst by the annual number of\ndays (365), we get the annual average of Ap and Dst. Hence for\nlinear regression and correlation, the annual sum of Ap (and\nDst) can be replaced by the annual average of these indices.\nIn Table 2 we give the solar activity long term indices data:\nSSN stands for (Annual) Sunspot Number; SSN data were pro-\nvided by NASA\nhttp://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/greenwch/spot_num.txt\nAll the rest of the data were provided by the UK Solar Sys-\ntem Data Centre UKSSDC. Dst data are only available until\n2008. For 2009 and 2010 we used provisional data.\nWe give the relevant graph: Figure 1 gives the graphs of all\nthese long term indices (which are scaled in order to match the\nSSN values). We observe that all these indices have the general\nshape of the SSN curve, they exhibit roughly the same period-\nicity as SSN (11-year solar cycle).\n4. Long term effects\n4.1. Global indices\nFor the long term effects we shall use various statistical meth-\nods and tests. The simplest thing to do in order to start our study\nwould be to run a linear regression model (see Zois 2011 )\nbetween transformer failure number (TFN) and sunspot number\n(SSN). The sunspot number (SSN) will be our independent var-\niable X, whereas the transformer failure number (TFN) will be\nTable 1.Boulder Colorado station scale table\nK-index a-index Boulder, Colorado, USA observatory DB\nmeasurements (horizontal magnetic ﬁeld variations in nT)\nNOAA G-scale\n0 0 0–5 G0\n1 3 5–10 G0\n2 7 10–20 G0\n3 15 20–40 G0\n4 27 40–70 G0\n5 48 70–120 G1\n6 80 120–200 G2\n7 140 200–330 G3\n8 240 330–500 G4\n9 400 > 500 G5\nI.P.

These parameters\nwere estimated using the ordinary least squares method (with\nthe use of R and Microsoft Excel). We give in Figure 2 the\nrelevant scatter plot along with the linear regression line.\nOne interesting feature here is that the slope is negative\n(negative correlation). This means that when SSN increases,\nTFN decreases. At ﬁrst sight this might seem odd but there is\na good explanation and in order to reveal it, one has to go a\nbit deeper ( Zois 2011 ): In Figure 3 we plot the SSN (blue)\nand TFN curves (red and green) vs. time in a single graph\nand we observe that (although the TFN has considerable noise\nand ﬂuctuates), there is a ‘‘phase delay’’ between the two curves\nwhich is roughly equal to 4 and 5 years, namely approximately\nslightly less than half a solar cycle. For a clearer visual exhibi-\ntion of this phase delay we have also plotted the smoothed (and\nscaled) TFN curve (green). This means that the maximum num-\nber of failures occurs towards the end of the solar cycle when\nsolar activity attains its minimum. This is due to the cumulative\nnature of solar activity effects on transformers in the long term:\nThere is a building up phenomenon, as time passes solar activ-\nity aggravates transformers and failures occur after some\n‘‘threshold’’ (related to the durability of key transformer com-\nponents) is crossed. In Greece, which is a mid-latitude country,\nGICs are not so high and this threshold is crossed later in a solar\ncycle (towards the end). (In Figure 3 we have scaled the TFN\ncurve for clearer visual exhibition). So Figure 3 veriﬁes the neg-\native sign of the correlation coefﬁcient of the linear\napproximation.\nWe can perform a hypothesis testing ( Daniel & Terrell\n1995) using statistical inference to see if there is (linear) corre-\nlation between our variables X (SSN) and Y (TFN). We want to\ntest the null hypothesis H\n0: q = 0 (no correlation, q denotes the\npopulation correlation coefﬁcient, r, which denotes the sample\nTable 2.Long term solar activity data\nNo Year SSN Annual Ap mean Annual Dst mean\n(absolute value)\nAnnual no. of days\nwith Ap /C21 40\nAnnual no. of days\nwith Dst /C20/C0 40\n1 1989 1893 19 30 38 106\n2 1990 1707 16 21 23 68\n3 1991 1749 23 31 54 112\n4 1992 1134 16 26 23 76\n5 1993 657 15 19 19 38\n6 1994 358 18 23 39 65\n7 1995 210 13 17 10 35\n8 1996 103 9 11 0 2\n9 1997 258 8 14 5 20\n10 1998 770 12 17 16 38\n11 1999 1118 13 13 12 35\n12 2000 1434 15 19 23 43\n13 2001 1331 13 18 19 43\n14 2002 1249 13 21 17 64\n15 2003 763 22 22 35 43\n16 2004 485 13 12 14 22\n17 2005 357 13 16 21 40\n18 2006 182 8 12 4 14\n19 2007 90 7 8 0 0\n20 2008 34 7 8 0 2\n21 2009 37 4 3 (provisional) 0 1 (provisional)\n22 2010 198 6 6 (provisional) 3 4 (provisional)\nlong term solar activity indices\n0\n500\n1000\n1500\n2000\n2500\n1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015\nTime (year)\nSolar activity indices\nSSN\nAp mean\nDst mean\nAp>40\nDst<-40\nFigure 1.

The critical value then\nof t is 2.086. Since by the above formula we compute\nt = /C0 2.724 (namely in absolute value larger than the critical\nvalue), we reject the null hypothesis. Thus there is correlation.\nThe next order of business is to try some non-linear models\n(with respect to the variable X). The basic ansatz here is that\nthere is a continuous function Y = Y(X) relating the independent\nvariable X (which is some long term solar activity index) with\nthe dependent variable Y, which is the annual number of trans-\nformer failures. We have studied the following functional mod-\nels: logarithmic, polynomial (degrees 1–6), hyperbolic and\nexponential ( Pedhazur 1982 ; Barlow 1993 ; Goodall 1993 ;\nNievergelt 1994; Bjo¨rck 1996 ; Draper & Smith 1998 ; Pindyck\n& Rubinfeld 1998 ; Cohen et al. 2003 ; Kaw & Kalu 2008 ;\nVenables & Smith 2013 ):\nLogarithmic:\nY ¼ a ln X þ b\nwhere a, b are real parameters.\nPolynomial o fd e g r e e2u pt o6i n X:\nY ¼ b þ a\n1X þ a2X 2 þ a3X 3 þ a4X 4 þ a5X 5 þ a6X 6\nwhere a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6 and b are real parameters.\nHyperbolic:\nY ¼ aX b\nwhere a, b are real parameters.\nExponential:\nY ¼ a ebX\nwhere a, b are real parameters.\nWe estimate the parameters using again ordinary least\nsquares. We apply all these functional models to all our long\nterm indices (see Zois 2012 , 2013a, 2013b). The results are\nsummarised in Table 3 which contains the equations and the\ncorresponding coefﬁcients of determination R2.\nIn the non-linear case, when one uses a scalar multiple of\nthe variable this can make some difference, hence it makes\nsense to try to use the annual sum of the Ap or Dst index instead\nof the annual mean. However as we shall see in our case the\ndifference is small, practically non-existing. As an example\nwe consider the annual Dst sum (absolute value, instead of\nthe annual Dst mean):\nAnnual Dst sum (absolute value) vs. TFN\nLinear:\nY ¼/C0 0:3309 X þ 46:551\nwith R2 = 0.05.\nLogarithmic:\nY ¼/C0 4:3059 ln X þ 57:912\nwith R2 = 0.04.\nSSN vs TFN\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n0 500 1000 1500 2000\nSSN\nTFN\nFigure 2.

From the more direct indices the largest coefﬁcient of\ndetermination was obtained using the annual Dst mean with\nR2 = 0.23 and again a polynomial of degree 6. Very close lies\nthe coefﬁcient of determination using the Annual number of\ndays with Dst /C20/C0 40, R2 = 0.22. It is perhaps surprising to\nsee better ﬁtting when we use the SSN which is not a direct\nindex. The explanation for this is mathematical convenience:\nThis is a physics vs. maths game, physics prefers Dst as being\na more direct index for our purpose yet maths (statistics) prefer\nSSN which has a smoother graph as a function of time (we dis-\ncuss this issue in greater detail in the last section\n‘‘Conclusions’’).\n4.2. Local indices\nThe long term solar activity indices used in the previous subsec-\ntion were deﬁned using planetary averages like the Ap and Dst\nindices data. In this subsection we use some local geomagnetic\ndata from the Geomagnetic Observatory of Penteli (GOP for\nshort, its I.M.O. code is PEG) which is located about 30 km\nNorth East of Athens\nhttp://www.magstation.gr/geomagnetism/wiki/Main\nGOP belongs to IGME, the (Greek) Institute of Geology\nand Mineral Exploration\nhttp://www.igme.gr/portal/page?_pageid=33,56803&_dad=\nportal&_schema=PORTAL\nThis is the only geomagnetic station existing in Greece. It\nbecame a member of IMO (Intermagnet group/network) on\nthe 8th of November 2010\nhttp://www.magstation.gr/geomagnetism/wiki/News\nFor the period we are interested in, namely 1989–2010,\nGOP could only provide the 3 h K-index data. Using the data\nprovided by GOP, as a long term (direct, local) solar activity\nindex we deﬁned the annual mean of the daily sum of the 8\n3h K-indices measured by GOP.\nFor instance Penteli gave us the 3 h K-index for all days\nfrom 1989 to 2010.\nThus we computed the annual mean of the daily K-index\nsum and this is what we used as a long term (local) solar activ-\nity index.\nTable 4 gives the annual mean of the daily K-index sums\nfrom GOP.\nIn Figure 4 we give the graphs of SSN and (scaled) Annual\nmean of daily K-index sum from Penteli vs. Time. One can see\nthat it follows the general pattern of SSN, periodicity, two picks\nand two valleys.\nNext we run the same regression models as we did in the\nprevious subsection (both linear and non-linear) and we write\ndown our results:\nLinear:\nY ¼/C0 0:5098 X þ 65:602\nwith R\n2 = 0.13.\nLogarithmic:\nY ¼/C0 23:511 ln X þ 106:26\nwith R2 = 0.13.\nPolynomial: Among polynomials in X with degrees from 2\nup to 6, the largest coefﬁcient of determination was given using\na polynomial of degree 6\nY ¼ 89181 /C0 34006X þ 5330:3X\n2 /C0 439:69X 3 þ 20:146X 4\n/C0 0:4865X 5 þ 0:0048X 6\nwith R2 = 0.23.\nHyperbolic:\nSSN and (scaled) Annual mean of daily K-index\nsum vs Time \n0\n500\n1000\n1500\n2000\n2500\n1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015\nTime (years)\nSSN and (scaled) annual\nmean of daily K-ndex\nsum  \nY3\nY5\nFigure 4.

We summarise our regression results using Penteli\ndata in Table 5.\nNow in order to be as mathematically rigorous as possible,\nfor this ‘‘best ﬁtting curve’’ (polynomial of degree 6), we have\nto check some assumptions regarding non-linear regression and\nthe ordinary least squares method used to estimate the relevant\nparameters. The basic assumptions we have to check are homo-\nscedasticity and normality of the residuals (we assume weak ex-\nogeneity and there is no question about multicollinearity since\nessentially we use only one independent variable). If these tests\nfail that would mean that the ordinary least squares method\nused to estimate the parameters of the order six polynomial\ncurve should be replaced by a more elaborate method (like\nweighted least squares or perhaps generalised least squares or\niteratively weighted least squares).\nThe residuals are given in Table 6.\nIn order to check normality we perform the Shapiro-Wilk\ntest (Shapiro & Wilk 1965 ) for the residuals. Essentially we test\nthe null hypothesis that the residuals are normally distributed\nagainst the alternative that they are not. At the a =0 . 0 5c o n ﬁ -\ndence level, in our case the W statistic equals 0.93 and since the\nthreshold equals 0.91, we cannot reject the null hypothesis,\nhence the null hypothesis is accepted and thus the residuals\ncome from a normal population.\nIn order to check homoscedasticity we perform the Bartlett\ntest of homogeneity of variances (see Snedecor & Cochran\n1989) for the residuals. We divide the residuals in two groups,\nthe ﬁrst group consists of the ﬁrst 11 and the second group con-\nsists of the remaining 11 residuals (22 in total). We compute the\nvariances of the two samples, the ﬁrst one equals 103.4, the sec-\nond one equals 108.3. The Bartlett test is essentially the test of\nthe null hypothesis that the variances of the two samples are\nequal against the alternative that they are not. The relevant test\nstatistic, Bartlett’s K square follows the chi square distribution.\nIn our case we have two samples hence one degree of freedom.\nAt the a = 0.05 conﬁdence level the critical value is 0.946. The\nBartlett’s K square we compute is 0,00861. Since this is not lar-\nger than the critical value we cannot reject the null hypothesis\nthat the variances are equal, thus we accept the null hypothesis\nthat the variances are equal and hence the residuals (errors) are\nhomoscedastic.\n5.

We used R language\nand our results are summarised in Table 7 (as references\nfor the orthogonal polynomials used in R see Kennedy\n& Gentle 1980 ; Chambers & Hastie 1992 ).\nThe annual number of days with Dst /C20/C0 40 long term\nindex gives a rather impressive R\n2 value of 0.88 using orthog-\nonal polynomials (of 15th degree).\n6. Short term (immediate) effects\nFor an assessment of the short term effects of solar activity onto\nlarge transformers we follow what we described in Section 2\nabove. First, in Table 8 we present some key points from our\nstudy of the transformer failure data: in one column we have\nput the max Ap value with its speciﬁc date for each year. The\nnext column counts the number of stormy days ( Ap /C21 100 or\nDst /C20/C0 100) during each year. And then we count the failure\nstormy days in the next column, namely the stormy days on\nwhich some failure occurred (plus failures on max index day\nor 2–3 days after max index day but these are very few cases).\nSimilarly for the Dst index.\nA possible simple ‘‘cumulative short term effect index’’\nwould be the average (over the 22 years) of the fraction.\nðfailures days with Ap /C21 100Þ = ðNo: of days with Ap /C21 100Þ\nand similarly for the Dst index.\nAlternatively we could take the sum of failure days with\nAp /C21 100 from 1989 to 2010 and divide it with the total\nsum of days with Ap /C21 100 again from 1989 to 2010 (and sim-\nilarly for the Dst index). This will give for Ap the fraction\n11=43 /C25 0:26\nðnormalised fraction 6=43 /C25 0:14Þ\nand similarly for the Dst one computes\n13=82 /C25 0:16\nIn order to be able to interpret the above numbers as the\n(empirical) probability (or experimental probability or relative\nfrequency) to have a failure during a stormy daythe quotients\nhave to be normalised. A simple way to do that would be to\nconsider only one failure for each stormy day (there may be\nmore than one, e.g., see 7 April, 1995 in the Failure days with\nAp /C21 100 column in Table 8\n) and to consider strictly failures\noccurring during stormy days alone (and not failures during\n‘‘around’’ stormy days). This shows that Ap is perhaps a ‘‘more\nindicative’’ index for immediate-short term effects in Greece\nwhich motivated us to give also in Table 9 another assessment\nof the immediate-short term effects: We include two extra col-\numns, the ±3 days column which counts the number of failures\noccurring during the stormy days, namely the day with\nAp /C21 100, plus the number of failures occurring 3 days before\nor 3 days after the stormy days; similarly for the ±7 days\ncolumn.\nSimilar simple indices can be calculated and they can be\ninterpreted (after proper normalisation) as the experimental (a\nposteriori) probability to have a failure during a stormy day plus\nor minus 3 days (and similarly for the 7 days case).\nNext we describe brieﬂy some speciﬁc examples along with\nsome comments. We focus on cases with Ap /C21 100 or\nDst /C20/C0 100 or both.\n1989\nOne Case study for an immediate effect: On 21 October, 1989\nthe planetary Ap mean was 146 and the Dst planetary mean was\n/C0 191. In an 150 kV transformer in Alouminion, Central\nGreece, the Buchholz relay of the tap changer was triggered.\nThe cause was recorded as ‘‘unknown’’. This incident is a very\npossible immediate effect of solar activity (in particular GICs)\non a transformer.\nIn 1989 there were 5 days with Ap /C21 100: 13.3, 14.3,\n20.10, 21.10, and 17.11. During the March storm no failures\nwere reported a week before or after the storm. During the\nOctober storm there was one reported failure on the 21st Octo-\nber and four failures the week before (no failures the week\nafter). During the November storm there was one failure 3 days\nbefore and one failure 3 days after the storm (and two failures\no n ew e e ka f t e rt h es t o r m ) .\nIn 1989 there was the Quebec black-out in Canada due to\nthe solar super storm on 13–14 March 1989.

In an 150 kV trans-\nformer in Oinoﬁta (N of Athens) there was a tap changer\nmalfunction which was repaired.\nOn 5 June 1991 where the planetary Ap mean was 196 and\nthe Dst planetary mean was /C0 147. In an 150 kV trans-\nformer in Thiva (N of Athens) there was a tap changer mal-\nfunction which was repaired. The report said ‘‘malfunction\ncaused (in all likelihood) by overheating of unknown\ncause’’.\nOn 29 October 1991 where the planetary Ap mean was 128\nand the Dst planetary mean was /C0 173. In an 150 kV trans-\nformer in Alexandroupolis (NE Greece) the differential pro-\ntection relay was triggered; also some oil leakage was\nobserved. The tap changer was replaced, insulator replaced.\n1991 was a very active year, there were 11 days in total with\nAp /C21 100: 24, 25, 26 March and there was a reported failure on\nthe 24th and one on the 20th. In June on 5th, 10th and 13th Ap\nwas larger than or equal to 100 and we had one reported failure\non the 5th and four more in between a week of the stormy days.\nIn July the Ap was larger than or equal to 100 on the 9th and\n13th and we had two failures on the 7th and on the 6th (3 days\nbefore the 9th). Finally Ap was larger than or equal to 100 on\n29 October, 1 November and 9 November. We had a reported\nfailure on 29 October, one reported failure on the 25 October,\none on 8 November and one on 14 November.\n1992\nOne case study for an immediate effect: On 27 February 1992\nwhere the planetary Ap mean was 60 and the Dst planetary\nmean was /C0 101. In an 150 kV transformer in Ptolemaida (N\nGreece) the differential protection and Buchholz relays were\ntriggered and the failure was repaired.\nIn 1992 there was only 1 day with Ap /C21 100 (10.5) and\nthere was one reported failure one week after the storm (17.5).\n1993\nOne case study for an immediate effect: On 13 September 1993\nwhere the planetary Ap mean was 91 and the Dst planetary\nmean was /C0 109. In an 150 kV transformer in Lamia (Central\nGreece) there was a tap changer malfunction which was\nrepaired.\nIn 1993 there were no days with Ap /C21 100.\n1994\nZero case study for an immediate effect.\nIn 1994 there was only 1 day with Ap /C21 100 (17.4). There\nwas one reported failure 3 days after (and another one 8 days\nafter). Moreover on 03.04 Ap was 92 and there was one\nreported failure the day before and another one 3 days after.\n1995\nTwo case studies for an immediate effect: On 7 Apri 1995\nwhere the planetary Ap mean was 100 and the Dst planetary\nmean was /C0 82. In two 150 kV transformers, one in Corfu\n(NW corner of Greece) and another in Iasmos (N Greece) there\nwere reported failures: In the ﬁrst case there was inability to\nswitch from 15 kV to 21 kV and in the second the Buchholz\nrelay was triggered. In both cases the failures were repaired.\nIn 1995 there was 1 day with Ap /C21 100 (7 April). There\nwere two reported failures on that day, one failure the day\nbefore (6 April) and another one 6 days before (1 April)\n1996\nZero case study for an immediate effect.\nIn 1996 there was no day with Ap /C21 100.\n1997\nOne possible case study for an immediate effect: On 23\nNovember 1997 where the planetary Ap mean was 59 and\nthe Dst planetary mean was /C0 88. In one 150 kV transformer\nin Sindos Thessaloniki (N Greece) the Buchholz and differen-\ntial protection relays were triggered. The whole transformer\nwas replaced.\nIn 1997 there was no day with Ap /C21 100.\n1998\nZero case study for an immediate effect.\nIn 1998 there were 3 days with Ap /C21 100: 04.05 (with one\nfailure 4 days before), 27 August (with no failures one week\nbefore or after this date) and 25 September with one failure 6\ndays after.\n1999\nZero case study for an immediate effect.\nIn 1999 there were no days with Ap /C21 100.\n2000\nOne possible case study for an immediate effect: On 18\nSeptember 2000 where the planetary Ap mean was 70 and\nthe Dst planetary mean was /C0 104. In one 150 kV transformer\nin Komotini (N Greece) there was oil leakage due to an\nunknown reason. The failure was repaired.\nIn 2000 there were 3 days with Ap /C21 100: On 15 July (with\none failure 7 days after), 12 August (with one failure 6 days\nbefore and another failure 4 days after) and on 5 October (with\ntwo failures 6 days after).\n2001\nO n ep o s s i b l ec a s es t u d yf o ra ni m m e d i a t ee f f e c t :O n1A p r i l\n2001 where the planetary Ap mean was 38 and the Dst plane-\ntary mean was /C0 137.

The recorded\ncause for the failure was ‘‘ageing’’. The failure was repaired.\nIn 2001 there were 3 days with Ap /C21 100: On 31 March\n(with one failure 4 days before and one failure the next day),\non 6 November (with one failure 7 days after) and on 24\nNovember (with two failures 5 and 6 days before).\nJ.

There were\ntwo notable solar storms on 30th October 2003 and 20th\nNovember 2003. No recorded transformer failures around these\ndays in Greece (in fact there were no recorded failures from 26\nOctober until 3 December).\nIn 2003 there were 6 days with Ap /C21 100: On 29 May (no\nfailures in between 7 days, yet six failures in the next month),\non 18 August (with one failure 6 days before), on 29, 30, 31\nOctober (with one failure on 26 October) and on 20 November\n(no failures in between one week).\n2004\nZero possible Case study for an immediate effect. However,\nthere was a solar storm on 27 July with annual Ap max and\n2 days later on 29 July there was a failure on a 150 kV trans-\nformer in Sﬁkia (N. Greece). There was a failure in the cooling\nsystem which was repaired. The recorded cause of this failure\nwas ‘‘manufacture defect’’. Also on 31 July and on 4 August\nthere were also recorded failures on 150 kV transformers in\nW. Greece (Florina and Kanalaki, respectively). In the ﬁrst case\n(Florina, 31 July), the Buchholz and differential protection\nrelays were triggered. The recorded cause of the failure was\n‘‘manufacture defect’’. In the second case (Kanalaki, 4 August)\nthe differential protection relay was triggered, no cause\nrecorded. Moreover on 8, 9 and 10 November the Dst values\nwere /C0 210, /C0 125 and /C0 176 respectively. Five days later, on\n15 November there was a failure on an 150 kV transformer\nin N. Greece (Arachthos). No further details given in the failure\nreport form.\nIn 2004 there were 5 days with Ap /C21 100: On 25 and 27\nJuly (with three failures 7 days after) and on 8, 9, 10 November\n(with one failure 5 days after).\n2005\nOne possible case study for an immediate effect: On 11\nSeptember 2005 where the planetary Ap mean was 101 and\nthe Dst planetary mean was /C0 84. In one 150 kV transformer\nin Salamis (Central Greece, of the West coast of Athens) there\nwas a failure in a casing gasket which was replaced. The failure\nwas due to ‘‘manufacture defect’’ according to the failure\nreport.\nIn 2005 there were 2 days with Ap /C21 100: On 24 August\n(with one failure 2 days after and another one 8 days after)\nand on 11 September (with 1 failure 7 days before and another\none 4 days after).\n2006\nOne possible case study for an immediate effect: On 14 April\n2006 where the planetary Ap mean was 65 and the Dst plane-\ntary mean was /C0 63. In one 150 kV transformer in Lavrio (Cen-\ntral Greece, near Athens) there was a recorded failure with no\nexplanation or possible cause. There was however the note that\nthat particular transformer was functioning since 1971 with no\nfailures, hence it was implied that the cause was ageing.\nIn 2006 there were no days with Ap /C21 100.\n2007, 2008, 2009, 2010\nZero possible case study for an immediate effect.\nDuring those years there were no days with Ap /C21 100.\n7. Conclusions\nIn this work we tried to provide evidence that solar activity\naffects large transformers (400 kV and 150 kV) in Greece.\nEffects are divided into short term (immediate) and long term\neffects. The common belief in PPC for many years (in fact since\nits founding in 1950s) was that there are no such effects because\nGreece is a mid-latitude country (latitude approximately 35 /C176–\n41/C176North). The second goal was to provide a method to assess\nsolar activity long term effects on large transformers by using\nvarious analytic and statistical methods.\nLet us start with the short term (immediate) effects: We used\ntransformer failures data for the period 1989–2010 provided by\nIPTO (ADMIE), the Greek independent power transmission\noperator, a fully subsidiary company of PPC (the Public Power\nCorporation of Greece). After some data clearance (in order to\nget rid of obviously irrelevant to GICs failures), we ended up\nwith a list of transformer failures which could be related to\nGICs. This task had some difﬁculties since PPC personnel\nare not trained on GICs (like say their co-workers in other coun-\ntries where for example technicians have to ﬁll in speciﬁc\nrepairing forms in the shape of a questionnaire, thus helping\nto identify GIC-related failures easier). Nonetheless, having\nour set of transformer failure data at hand, we juxtaposed it with\nsolar activity data and we saw classic cases of GIC-related\nfailures like triggering of protecting relays, oil leakage due to\ninsulation destruction, etc., appearing on days of elevated solar\nactivity (say Ap index larger than 100). We obtained clearance\nto publicise some of these cases and brieﬂy analysed them in\nSection 6 (see also Table 8).\nHowever, there are also rapid variations of the terrestrial\nmagnetic ﬁeld a few days prior to a solar storm (see Dessler\net al. 1960 ; Tsunomura 1998) and for this reason we extended\nour research not only on stormy days but also on short periods\naround a stormy day: We chose two additional time scales, ±3\ndays and ±7 days around a stormy day. The plus or minus 3\ndays time scale was chosen in order to include effects due to\nsudden commencement of a storm – primarily for the ‘‘minus’’\npart. We also observed that there is an important increase in fail-\nures during days +4, +5, +6 and +7 from a stormy day and thus\nwe decided to include the ±7 days time scale as well (the minus\nwas included for ‘‘symmetry’’, there were no observed failures\nduring /C0 4, /C0 5, /C0 6a n d /C0 7). Taking a closer look of the data\nwe saw evidence that this second scale captures failures trig-\ngered shortly after a storm and reveals ‘‘weaknesses’’ of the\ntransformers like bad maintenance, etc. Hence during the period\nof interest (1989–2010), there were 43 stormy days (namely\ndays with Ap /C21 100) and we observed 19 failures occurring\nduring a stormy day plus or minus 3 days and 51 failures occur-\nring during a stormy day plus or minus 7 days (see Table 9).\nAs an attempt to assess in a cumulative manner the proba-\nbility to have a transformer failure somewhere in Greece during\nI.P. Zois: Solar activity and transformer failures in the Greek national electric grid\nA32-p13\na day of high solar activity we simply counted the number of\nstormy days (namely days with Ap /C21 100 or Dst /C20/C0 100)\nand then we counted in how many of them we observed a trans-\nformer failure and by division we got an idea of a probability\n(or relative frequency) to have a transformer failure during a\nstormy day (or around a stormy day).\nFor the long term effects: We had to deﬁne some new long\nterm solar activity indices and then we tried to quantify the long\nterm effects using statistical and analytic techniques. Long term\nsolar activity indices have been deﬁned using both global\n(namely planetary average) short term indices data (like Ap\nand Dst data) and local (from the Penteli Magnetic Observatory\nnear Athens) short term indices data (like the 3 h K-index data).\nIn particular we deﬁned and used six long term indices, ﬁve\nusing global data and one using local data: The former include\nthe annual number of sunspots (SSN), the annual Ap mean, the\nannual Dst mean (and the annual Dst sum), the annual number\nof disturbed days, namely days with Ap /C21 40 and the annual\nnumber of days with Dst /C20/C0 40. The only local geomagnetic\ndata available for the period of interest (1989–2010) was the\n3h K-index provided by the Geomagnetic Observatory of Pent-\neli near Athens. Using these K-index data we deﬁned the annual\nmean of the daily K-index sum which we used as a long term\nlocal solar activity index.\nThe ﬁrst important fact revealed from our analysis, concern-\ning the long term effects of solar activity onto large transform-\ners, is shown in Figure 3 w h e r ew ep l o t t e db o t hS S N( a n n u a l\nsunspot number) and TFN (annual transformer failure number)\nas functions of time in the same graph: In Figure 3 we observe\ntwo striking (at least for PPC technicians) facts:\n1. Apart from noise, failures do show periodicity similar to\nthe periodicity of solar activity (the solar cycles).\n2. The two graphs seem to have a ‘‘phase delay’’ roughly\nhalf a solar cycle (more precisely 4–5 years).\nLet us make some comments on these facts: This rather\nrevealing graph indicates that the annual number of failures\ngenerally follows the solar activity pattern, it has a periodicity\nsimilar to the 11-year solar cycle but it has a ‘‘phase delay’’:\nDuring solar cycle 22 (1986–1996) the max number of sunspots\nwas observed in 1989 and the max number of failures was\nobserved in 1993 (4 years later). During solar cycle 23\n(1996–2008) the max number of sunspots was observed in\n2000 and the max number of failures was observed in 2006\n(6 years later). So by average the phase delay is about 5 years\nlater, roughly half a solar cycle. This can be explained by the\nfact that GICs in Greece are existing but smaller compared to\nsay Scandinavian countries and cumulative effects dominate;\nthere is a building up phenomenon related say to erosion of\ntransformer components, say insulators: Failures occur after\nsome threshold is crossed and since GICs in Greece (latitude\napproximately 35/C176–41/C176N) are generally smaller, this threshold\nis crossed later (the erosion of components is not so fast). Sim-\nilar, relatively ‘‘mild’’ effects were reported from the US power\ngrid (see Schrijver & Mitchell 2013 ) where the focus was not\non component – transformer failures but on the grid’s inability\nto maintain power quality, thus including outages as well as\nvoltage sags and frequency shifts. So the picture is that as lat-\nitude increases, this phase delay should decrease, namely in say\nScandinavian countries one would expect very little or no phase\ndelay at all (well, one has to be more careful here since failures\nalso depend on ground conductivity, grid topology, etc., the\nabove conjecture assumes that all other ‘‘variables’’ are the\nsame, say if one could move Greece and its grid in the position\nof Finland). Note however that if one uses another more direct\nlong term earth affecting solar activity index, this time differ-\nence gets shorter: for example the max Ap mean, the max\nDst mean, the max of annual number of days with Ap /C21 40\nand the max of annual number of days with\nDst /C20/C0 40 for\nsolar cycle 22 they all occurred in 1991 – and not in 1989 as\nsunspots did – and in this case the phase delay was 2 years\nand not 4. For solar cycle 23, the max Ap mean, the max Dst\nmean, the max of annual number of days with Ap /C21 40 all\noccurred in 2003 (yet the max of annual number of days with\nDst /C20/C0 40 occurred in 2002) and not in 2000 as sunspots did\nand in this case the phase delay was 3 years and not 6. Figure 3\nalong with the above discussion also explains the negative sign\nof the correlation coefﬁcient between TFN and SSN (linear\nregression approximation).\nThen we applied various statistical techniques, regression\nand correlation, using a number of function models: linear,\npolynomial (of various degrees), logarithmic, exponential and\nhyperbolic and we computed the corresponding equations\n(coefﬁcients) and coefﬁcient of determination. We gathered\nall these regression results in Table 3 (for the global long tern\nsolar activity indices) and in Table 5 (Sect. 4.2) we presented\nthe regression results for the local long term solar activity index\n(data from Penteli).\nNow let us comment on the regression results: The best\nresults (larger coefﬁcient of determination) in all cases were\ngiven by polynomials and this is due to the Stone-Weierstrass\nTheorem from functional analysis.\nAnother interesting point here is that the highest coefﬁcient\nof determination (0.35) was obtained using SSN (along with a\npolynomial of 6th degree). This is perhaps a little surprising\nsince SSN is a global and indirect (for our purposes) index.\nOne might expect that the best results would have been\nobtained with the local K-index data (direct and local index).\nThe explanation for this fact is, we believe, that the SSN curve\nis smoother and it complies better with the mathematical\nrequirements of regression (see also below). However, when\nwe push polynomial regression to the limit and we use more\nsophisticated mathematical tools, the best result ( R\n2 =0 . 8 8 )i s\nobtained by the ‘‘direct’’ index annual number of days with\nDst /C20/C0 40.\nWe would also like to make a comment on the use of the\nspeciﬁc data to deﬁne our long term indices: The reason for\nchoosing to rely primarily (but not exclusively) on Ap and\nDst data throughout this work (which are planetary averages)\nis this: There is only one geomagnetic station in Greece, the\nPenteli Magnetic Observatory. It is understandable that the\n‘‘slope’’DB/Dt with Dt ~ 1 min (or the geoelectric ﬁeld) would\nbe more physically relevant short term geomagnetic local\nindices.\nThese local data ( DB/Dt with Dt ~ 1 min) are not publicly\navailable from the magnetic observatory of Penteli; in fact we\nare not even sure if they exist for the period of interest\n(1989–2010) since Penteli became a member of the World Data\nCentre for Geomagnetism from late 2010 onwards.\nAs far as the geoelectric ﬁeld is concerned, we are not\naware of any institution in Greece making such measurements.\nWe would like to mention however that even if these local\ndata were available, one has to bear in mind that the ﬁnal step\nwould be to use them to deﬁne a long term index (on an annual\nbasis). The most obvious choice would be to compute some\nannual average. It is probable that the ‘‘sensitivity’’ of these\nshort term local indices might be lost when we pass on from\nJ. Space Weather Space Clim. 3 (2013) A32\nA32-p14\nshort term to the long term. For example if one computed the\nannual average of the 1 min slope DB/Dt, there are half a mil-\nlion minutes in a year and thus this long term index (annual one\nminute variation of the magnetic ﬁeld) might be almost constant\nthroughout the 11-year solar cycle. The next step would be to\napply statistical regression techniques. These mathematical\nmethods rely on certain mathematical theorems which in turn\nare based on certain assumptions (the most important ones\nare that the variables are non-stochastic, weak exogeneity holds,\nhomoscedasticity holds, normality of residuals holds, there is\nno self-correlation of the residuals, the covariance between\nthe variable values and the error term tends to zero, etc. – we\nchecked some of them for one speciﬁc case, the annual average\nof the daily K-index sum from Penteli); it is not guaranteed that\nthe most physically relevant indices are those which satisfy the\nmathematical assumptions the most and hence give the largest\ncoefﬁcient of determination (this is the meaning of the phrase in\nthe text that ‘‘this is a physics vs. maths game’’ and that ‘‘the\nSSN time curve has a smoother graph’’). As we can see from\nour results, for example SSN is an indirect earth affecting solar\nactivity index yet nonetheless gives a satisfactory coefﬁcient of\ndetermination – perhaps a rather surprisingly satisfactory coef-\nﬁcient of determination. Hence our approach to use statistics\nand the coefﬁcient of determination as a criterion (which, let\nus recall does not necessarily mean causation but it does mean\npredictability according to one of the golden rules in statistics)\ngives in some sense the optimal result between basically three\npairs of opposite parameters: short term vs. long term, physical\nrelevance vs. mathematical convenience, global vs. local geo-\nmagnetic data. Needless to say if we had these data we would\nhave run our models for them too.\nIt is straightforward that the physical quantity which is the\nmost physically relevant for our study are the GICs. The ideal\nwould be to have local measurements for GICs, deﬁne some\nlong term index from them and then apply our statistical models\nbetween GICs and TFN. Yet these currents have never been\nmeasured directly anywhere in Greece during the past and to\nthe best of our knowledge there is no program to do so in\nthe future. It is well known however that there is a good linear\napproximation between GICs and the geoelectric ﬁeld (see e.g.,\nLindahl 2003; Pulkkinen 2003; Viljanen et al. 2004 ; Pulkkinen\net al. 2008 , 2010, 2012), given by the following equation\nGIC ¼ aE xþ bE y;\nwhere ( a, b) are system-speciﬁc parameters typically in the\nrange of 0–200 (in A km/V) and Ex and Ey are the horizontal\ncomponents of the geoelectric ﬁeld ( y-axis in the east-west\ndirection with the positive y-semi-axis pointing to the east\nand the x-axis in the south-north direction with the positive\nx-semi-axis pointing to the north). If no transformer data is\nknown then the values a = b = 50 A km/V can give a good\napproximation of the sum of GIC ﬂowing over all phases\nof the transformer. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowl-\nedge, there are no measurements of the geoelectric ﬁeld any-\nwhere in Greece either.\nOne can compute the geoelectric ﬁeld from the geomag-\nnetic ﬁeld (horizontal components Bx, By) using the relations\nsuggested in the literature given above ( Lindahl 2003 ;\nPulkkinen 2003; Viljanen et al. 2004 ; Pulkkinen et al. 2008 ,\n2010, 2012):\nExðxÞ¼½ ZðxÞ By ðxÞ/C138 =l0\nand\nEyðxÞ¼½ ZðxÞ Bx ðxÞ/C138 =l0;\nwhere l0 is the permeability of the vacuum, x is the angular\nfrequency of the ﬂuctuating ﬁeld (about 0.01–0.1 Hz) and\nZ(x) denotes the surface impedance which depends on the\nground conductivity. These equations are derived from\nFaraday’s Law making various simpliﬁcations. Again, to\nthe best of our knowledge there are no measurements of the\nsurface impedance in Greece.\nSo the key thing is that we believe we did our best with the\ndata available.\nAcknowledgements.
