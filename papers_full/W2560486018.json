Several studies have emphasized the importance of modelling foundation response with represen-\ntative damping and stiffness characteristics in integrated analyses of offshore wind turbines (OWTs). For the\nmonopile foundation, the industry standard for pile analysis has shown to be inaccurate, and alternative models\nthat simulate foundation behaviour more accurately are needed. As fatigue damage is a critical factor in the\ndesign phase, this study investigates how four different soil-foundation models affect the fatigue damage of an\nOWT with a monopile foundation. This study shows how both stiffness and damping properties have a noticeable\neffect on the fatigue damage, in particular for idling cases. At mud-line, accumulated fatigue damage varied up\nto 22 % depending on the foundation model used.\n1 Introduction\nOver the last decade there has been a strong tendency to\nlook offshore to further increase the wind energy potential in\nnorthern Europe. This had led to a total of over 3000 installed\noffshore wind turbines, with a capacity of more than 11 GW\n(December 2015). Large offshore sites with suitable wind\nconditions are still accessible, and together with strong polit-\nical incentives this led to high growth expectations for the in-\ndustry (EWEA, 2015a). Installation, maintenance, and foun-\ndation costs tend to increase with distance from shore and\nwater depth, making cost reductions important. So far, im-\nproved supply chain integration and large-capacity turbines\nhave been the main methods for cost reductions (ORE Cata-\npult, 2015). However, cost reductions can also be achieved by\ncost-efﬁcient design. With the support structure contributing\nup to 20 % of the capital cost (EWEA, 2015b), optimizing\nfoundation design has a high potential for cost reductions.\nIntegrated time domain analysis plays a central role in\nthe design phase of offshore wind turbines (OWTs). Inte-\ngrated analysis refers to fully coupled analysis of the com-\nplete OWT system, including rotor, support structure, and\nfoundation. The foundation response has a signiﬁcant impact\non the dynamic behaviour of the OWT (see Sect. 2.3), which\nas a result inﬂuences the dimensioning of the structure. As\na consequence, the foundation modelling becomes important\nin the design phase, as integrated time domain analyses are\nused.\nFor depths up to 30 m, the monopile is the most com-\nmon support structure, accounting for approximately 80 %\nof the installations (EWEA, 2015a). This foundation type re-\nsults in long and slender structures sensitive to resonance\neffects since wave and wind loads are typically close to\nthe natural frequencies of the structure. Because of this, the\nsoil-foundation response can have a high impact on the dy-\nnamics of the system and thereby the fatigue damage of\nthe structure. With fatigue damage being a design driver,\nsoil-foundation modelling becomes important in design. The\nmost widespread methods for fatigue estimations are time\ndomain simulations with S-N curves and frequency domain\ncalculations. A comparison of these methods can be found in\nRagan and Manuel (2007). The industry standard for fatigue\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Academy of Wind Energy e.V.\n362 S. Aasen et al.: Effect of foundation modelling on a monopile-based OWT\ndamage calculations is the time domain simulation withS-N\ncurves described by DNV (2014), which is used in this study.\nDifferent approaches can be used to model the soil-\nfoundation response for piles. Generally, they are divided\ninto two groups: continuum approaches and subgrade reac-\ntion approaches. In continuum approaches, the soil is treated\nas a continuum material described by a constitutive rela-\ntion. The problem of a pile embedded in a continuum ma-\nterial can be solved analytically if the soil is assumed to be\na linear elastic material, e.g. Poulos (1971), or numerically\nif the soil is characterized by a more complex constitutive\nrelation. Among the numerical methods, the boundary ele-\nment method, see for instance Kaynia and Kausel (1982),\nand the ﬁnite element (FE) method, e.g. Randolph (1981)\nor Andresen et al. (2010), are the most widely used. In the\nsubgrade reaction approaches, the soil response around the\npile is described by a set of uncoupled individual horizontal\nsprings, where the interaction between layers is only taken\ninto account by the pile continuity. The springs relate the\nlocal lateral resistance, p, to the local lateral displacement\nof the pile, y, following a predeﬁned function. Several p–\ny functions can be found in the literature; see for instance\nReese and Van Impe (2010). However, the API (2014) p–y\ncurves are the most widely used.\nThe aim of this paper is to study four different soil-\nfoundation models with respect to their impact on fatigue\ndamage of the OWT structure. Both the conventional method\nfor pile analysis (p–ycurves) and simple linear elastic mod-\nels have been compared with a non-linear elastic model with\nhysteretic damping. A range of environmental conditions\nhave been simulated to study the soil-foundation models for\ndifferent loading. This paper is a continuation of the master’s\nthesis of the ﬁrst author (Aasen, 2016).\nFollowing the introduction, Sect. 2 gives a review of ob-\nserved foundation behaviour, current foundation models for\nOWT monopiles, and relevant studies investigating effects of\nsoil stiffness and damping. Section 3 presents the simulation\nsoftware 3DFloat and the different soil-foundation models\nstudied in this paper. Section 4 presents the OWT structure,\nthe soil proﬁle, and the environmental conditions that have\nbeen applied in simulations. The calibration of each soil-\nfoundation model, together with the methodology for fatigue\ndamage calculations, is also included at the end of Sect. 4.\nSection 5 presents the results from the analysis that has been\ncarried out, followed by the conclusion in Sect. 6.\n2 Foundation behaviour\n2.1 Observed foundation behaviour\nThe foundation has to resist the loads transferred from the\nstructure above and remain functional and stable during the\nlifetime of the OWT. Piles supporting monopile-based OWTs\nare subjected to large horizontal loads applied with an arm\nof about 30–90 m, which results in large bending moments\nFigure 1.Observed foundation behaviour.\nat the foundation. The vertical load is relatively small com-\npared with the horizontal and bending moment loads (Byrne\nand Houlsby, 2003). Large-diameter piles resist these loads\nby mobilizing lateral resistance in the soil. Due to the interac-\ntion between the pile and the soil, the foundation response is\ninﬂuenced by the response of the soil around it. The most\nimportant characteristics of soil behaviour with respect to\nmonopiles are\n1. non-linear response. Soils show non-linear response\nduring loading. In pile foundations, the generation of\nplastic deformations in the soil around the pile causes\nplastic displacements and rotations, resulting in a non-\nlinear load-displacement foundation response. This be-\nhaviour is illustrated in Fig. 1 between points 0 and\n1. Several pile tests displaying the non-linear load-\ndisplacement response can be found in the literature; see\nfor instance Poulos and Davis (1980), Cox et al. (1974),\nand Reese et al. (1975) for ﬂexible piles or Byrne et\nal. (2015) for more rigid piles with large diameters typ-\nical for monopiles supporting monopile-based OWTs.\n2. different stiffness during loading, unloading, and\nreloading. Soils exhibit different stiffness during load-\ning, unloading, and reloading. When the load acting on\nthe foundation is reversed (points 1 to 2 in Fig. 1), the\nsoil around the pile is unloaded. Initially the soil un-\nloading is elastic and the pile response is stiffer than\nprior to the reversal. As the magnitude of the load re-\nversal increases, more plastic deformations are gener-\nated and the stiffness decreases (points 2 to 3). During\nreloading (points 3 to 5 and back to 1), a similar pattern\nis observed. This behaviour has been reported in cyclic\nlarge- and small-scale pile tests (see for instance Little\nand Briaud, 1988; Roesen et al., 2013) or in centrifuge\nWind Energ. Sci., 2, 361–376, 2017 www.wind-energ-sci.net/2/361/2017/\nS.

Two different types of damping are present\nin foundation problems: radiation damping, where the\nenergy is dissipated through geometric spreading of\nthe waves propagating through the soil, and hysteretic\ndamping, where energy is dissipated due to plastic de-\nformations. Radiation damping depends on the load-\ning frequency, and it is negligible for frequencies be-\nlow 1 Hz (Andersen, 2010). Hysteretic soil damping de-\npends on the strain level in the soil and is affected by the\nloading history. For monopiles supporting OWTs, radi-\nation damping can be neglected, and the main damp-\ning contribution comes from hysteretic damping. The\nhysteretic nature of the foundation damping has been\nnoted in free vibration tests (Hanssen et al., 2016),\nwhere the foundation damping decreased with decreas-\ning displacement amplitude. The hysteretic loss of en-\nergy at foundation level is illustrated in Fig. 1 in the area\nenclosed by the dotted line. Hysteretic load displace-\nment loops can also be observed in cyclic large- and\nsmall-scale pile tests and in centrifuge tests (Klinkvort\net al., 2010; Roesen et al., 2013).\nFull-scale measurements of monopile-based OWTs also\nconﬁrm the non-linear hysteretic foundation response. Kalle-\nhave et al. (2015) observed that the measured natural fre-\nquency of monopile-based OWTs decreased with increasing\nwind speeds and related it to increasing displacement levels.\nThe same conclusion was reached by Damgaard et al. (2013)\nwhen analysing the reduction in natural frequency with in-\ncreasing acceleration levels.\nFor OWTs in operation, several authors (Damgaard et\nal., 2013; Shirzadeh et al., 2013; Tarp-Johansen et al., 2009;\nVersteijlen et al., 2011) found foundation damping between\n0.25 and 1.5 % of critical damping depending on load level\nand soil proﬁle.\n2.2 Current foundation modelling\nThe industry standard for representing the pile response in\nintegrated analyses of monopile-based OWTs is based in the\nso-called p–y curve approach. In the p–y curve methodol-\nogy, the pile is modelled as a beam and the soil is repre-\nsented by a series of discrete, uncoupled, non-linear elastic\nsprings at nodal points along the pile. The springs relate the\nlocal lateral resistance, p, to the local lateral displacement\nof the pile, y, and are a function of the depth below mud-\nline. The DNV standard (DNV , 2014) recommends the use of\nAPI p–ycurves (API, 2014) for the estimation of the lateral\npile capacity in ultimate limit state (ULS) analyses. However,\nthe p–y curves were developed for long and slender jacket\npiles with large length-to-diameter ratios, signiﬁcantly differ-\nent from typical monopile geometries. Several studies have\nshown the limitations of the p–y curve approach (Doherty\nand Gavin, 2011; Lesny, 2010; Jeanjean, 2009; Hearn and\nEdgers, 2010), and alternatives to the American Petroleum\nInstitute (API) formulation have been proposed, such as p–\ny curves extracted from FE analysis of the soil-foundation\nsystem. Despite these curves being able to capture the pile\nstiffness more accurately, the same extracted p–y curve is\noften used in the simulation tools for loading, unloading,\nand reloading, which means that they neglect effects such\nas permanent deformations and soil damping. In this regard,\nDNV (2014) requires soil damping to be considered in the\ndesign phase, but no recommended practice for estimating\nsoil damping is suggested.\n2.3 Numerical studies investigating effects of soil\nstiffness and damping\nSome studies have been carried out to investigate the im-\npact of soil stiffness and damping on the structural response\nof monopile-based OWTs. Schafhirt et al. (2016) examined\nthe effect of variations in the soil stiffness on the equivalent\ndamage loads for a monopile in sand by using p–y curves\nwith different stiffness. The study suggests that a reduction\nof 50 % in the soil stiffness lead to an increase of 7 % in the\nequivalent damage loads at mud-line. Damgaard et al. (2015)\nstudied the impact of a change in soil stiffness and damping\non the fatigue loads, where the foundation was represented\nby a lumped-parameter model. They found that a 50 % re-\nduction in the soil’s Young modulus increased the fatigue\ndamage equivalent moment at mud-line by approximately\n12 %; and a 50 % reduction of the soil damping properties\nincreased the fatigue damage equivalent moment by 25 %.\nCarswell et al. (2015) studied the effect of soil damping for\nan OWT with a monopile foundation subjected to extreme\nstorm loading. The hysteretic damping was computed using a\nnon-linear elastic two-dimensional ﬁnite element model and\nwas included in the foundation model by a viscous rotational\ndamper at mud-line. From stochastic time history analysis\nthey found that the maximum and standard deviation of the\nmud-line moment was reduced by 7–9 % due to soil damp-\ning. These contributions highlight the impact of the soil stiff-\nness and damping on the fatigue loads. However, each of\nthese studies uses different soil proﬁles and modelling ap-\nproaches to represent the foundation stiffness and damping,\nwhich makes a comparison between the different foundation\nmodels and damping contributions difﬁcult. In this regard,\nZaaijer (2006) compared the ﬁrst and second predicted natu-\nral frequencies for different foundation models: an effective\nﬁxity length, a linear elastic stiffness matrix at mud-line, un-\ncoupled springs, and p–y curves. The elastic stiffness and\nthe p–y curves gave comparable predicted natural frequen-\ncies. In addition, Jung et al. (2015) carried out a comparison\nbetween three foundation models with focus on the founda-\ntion stiffness. In the study, the foundation response was rep-\nresented by a stiffness matrix at mud-line, distributed p–y\nelements, and a FE model of the soil volume.

It was found that the bending mo-\nments calculated by using the p–yapproach and the FE ap-\nproach were very similar.\nIn this study, the aim is to evaluate the impact of foun-\ndation stiffness and damping on the fatigue damage of a\nmonopile-based OWT in a lifetime perspective using the\nfoundation modelling approach. For that purpose, four dif-\nferent foundation models have been calibrated for the same\nsoil proﬁle, and a series of simulations representative for the\nOWT lifetime have been performed. The results in terms of\naccumulated fatigue damage are presented and discussed.\n3 Modelling of OWT and foundation\n3.1 3DFloat\nThe simulation software 3DFloat has been used for modal\nanalysis and time domain simulations. 3DFloat is an aero-\nservo-hydro-elastic ﬁnite-element-method code, developed\nby the Institute for Energy Technology (IFE) and the Norwe-\ngian University of Life Sciences (NMBU). This means that\nhydrodynamic loads, aerodynamic loads, and the control sys-\ntem are considered when calculating the elastic response of\nthe system. 3DFloat has been veriﬁed and validated in the\nIEA OC3, OC4, and OC5 projects, wave tank tests, and by\nparticipation in commercial projects. For more details, see\nNygaard et al. (2016).\nStructural elements are modelled by Euler–Bernoulli\nbeams with 12 degrees of freedom (DOFs). Loads from\ngravity, buoyancy, waves, current, and wind are applied as\ndistributed external loads on the structure. Forces per unit\nlength are integrated with the interpolation functions used in\nthe Galerkin formulation of the FE method. The distributed\nforces are thereby lumped to consistent nodal loads (forces\nand moments), applied to the nodes connecting the elements.\nForces from waves and currents on slender beams are calcu-\nlated by the relative form of Morison’s equation. In this study,\ncombinations of Airy wave components according to the\nJoint North Sea Wave Project (JONSW AP) spectrum were\nused to simulate irregular sea states.\nThe quadratic drag forces on the tower above the instan-\ntaneous wave surface are computed from the turbulent wind.\nThe wind turbine distributed blade loads are computed from\nblade element momentum theory, taking into account the\nelastic deformation of the structure.\nCurrently new soil-foundation models are implemented in\n3DFloat as part of the research project REDWIN 1. Previ-\nously, springs and dampers were used to model soil resis-\ntance. As part of this study, a non-linear model with hys-\nteretic damping has been implemented in the code, referred\nto as Model 4 throughout this paper.\n1www.ngi.no/eng/Projects/REDWIN.\nFigure 2. Model 1 applies non-linear p–y curves along the im-\nmersed part of the pile. Thep–ycurves are applied to both horizon-\ntal directions. The bottom of the pile is restrained against translation\nin the zdirection and rotation around the zaxis.\n3.2 Soil-foundation models\nFour approaches have been used to model the pile-foundation\nresponse. They are referred as Models 1, 2, 3, and 4. Model 1\nrefers to the conventional distributed p–yelement approach.\nModels 2–4 give the full loading response from the soil–pile\nsystem at a single node connected to the superstructure. Of\nthe four models, Models 3 and 4 account for soil damping.\nBelow follows a description of the four models. The calibra-\ntion of each model is presented in Sect. 4.4.\n3.2.1 Model 1\nModel 1 refers to the p–y element approach, where non-\nlinear elastic springs are distributed along the pile and pro-\nvide soil resistance at different depths. The model does not\ninclude any damping. A representation of the model is given\nin Fig. 2. Each spring can have different soil-reaction dis-\nplacement characteristics. The bottom of the pile is con-\nstrained for translation along and rotation around the zaxis.\nP–y curves are applied along both horizontal directions. A\ntypical shape of a p–ycurve for sand is given in Fig. 3.\n3.2.2 Model 2\nIn Model 2, a linear elastic stiffness matrix applied at the\nmud-line represents the pile-foundation response. By this ap-\nproach, the model neglects non-linear effects and damping.\nA representation of the model is given in Fig. 4. The stiff-\nness coefﬁcients should reﬂect the load level considered to\nWind Energ. Sci., 2, 361–376, 2017 www.wind-energ-sci.net/2/361/2017/\nS.

The stiffness\nmatrix used in this study is presented in Sect. 4.4.3.\n3.2.3 Model 3\nModel 3 applies a stiffness matrix as in Model 2, but a damp-\ning matrix is included to account for soil damping. A repre-\nsentation of this model is given in Fig. 5, where K is a stiff-\nness matrix, d is a displacement vector, and C is a damping\nmatrix. In Model 3, damping coefﬁcients are only applied in\nrotational degrees of freedom (rotation aroundxand yaxes),\nas moments typically dominate mud-line loading for OWT\nmonopiles (Carswell et al., 2015). The moment response for\na single degree of freedom is given by\nMc =c×˙θ, (1)\nwhere c [Nm s rad−1] is a damping coefﬁcient, and ˙θ\n[rad s−1] is the angular rate of change. This makes soil damp-\ning a function of frequency for the system. As explained in\nSect. 2.1, hysteretic damping dominates the damping from\nthe foundation. As hysteretic damping is a function of load\nFigure 5.Model 3 applies a stiffness matrix and a damping matrix\nat the mud-line node to model the soil-foundation response.\nFigure 6.

Know-\ning the hysteretic energy loss due to soil damping per load\ncycle, a damping coefﬁcient for a single degree of freedom\ncan be found by\nc= Eh(M)\n2θ2π2f, (2)\nwhere Eh(M) [J] is the hysteretic energy loss per load cycle,\nθ[rad] is the angular displacement amplitude, and f [s−1] is\nthe loading frequency of the system.\n3.2.4 Model 4\nModel 4 is a non-linear 1-D rotational model, where the\nstiffness depends on the load level. The model is applied to\nrotational DOFs (rotation around x and y axis). To reﬂect\nboth the rotation and horizontal displacement at mud-line,\nthe model is applied 10 m below the mud-line, where the pile\ncan rotate around the x and y axes. A massless rigid beam\nconnects the model to the ﬂexible tower at mud-line. A rep-\nresentation of the model is given in Fig. 6, and a conceptual\nﬁgure of the spring-slip elements is given in Fig. 7.\nThe model can reproduce different stiffness during load-\ning, unloading, and reloading and produce hysteretic damp-\ning. The model is formulated following the approach sug-\nwww.wind-energ-sci.net/2/361/2017/ Wind Energ. Sci., 2, 361–376, 2017\n366 S. Aasen et al.: Effect of foundation modelling on a monopile-based OWT\ngested by Iwan (1967), where several linear elastic-perfectly\nplastic springs are coupled in parallel, as illustrated in\nFig. 5a. Each of the springs has a different stiffness ki and\nyield load M∗\ni but forced to have the same deformation\nθ. The linear elastic-perfect plastic behaviour of each in-\ndividual spring and slip element is shown in Fig. 5b. The\nload Mi of each spring and slip element increases linearly\nwith a stiffness ki until the critical slipping moment M∗\ni·is\nreached. When the loading direction is reversed, each spring\nand slider element unloads or reloads following the spring\nstiffness ki, reproducing Masing’s rule (Masing, 1926). The\nresulting load M is calculated as the sum of each Mi. The\nmodel gives a stepwise variable stiffness and an overall kine-\nmatic hardening behaviour when subjected to cyclic load-\ning. An example of the M-θ response is shown in Fig. 5c.\nThe load-displacement curve can be represented sufﬁciently\nsmoothly by using a high number of coupled springs. A sim-\nilar model has been recently implemented in the simulation\nsoftware FAST (Jonkman and Buhl Jr., 2005) by Krathe and\nKaynia (2017).\n4 Case study\n4.1 Structural properties of OWT\nThe National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)\n5 MW wind turbine, with monopile foundation accord-\ning to OC3 Phase II (Jonkman and Musial, 2010), has\nbeen used in this study. The structure was developed\nto support concept studies for offshore wind turbines\nand is a utility-scale multimegawatt wind turbine, with\na three-bladed upwind variable-speed variable-blade-pitch-\nto-feather-controlled turbine (Jonkman et al., 2009). An\noverview of the structural dimensions is given in Fig. 8. For\ndetails about the structure, the reader is referred to (Jonkman\net al., 2009). The transition piece has not been modelled and\nthe pile properties are extended up to the tower in the 3DFloat\nmodel.\n4.2 Soil proﬁle\nThe soil proﬁle has been taken from OC3 Phase II (Jonkman\nand Musial, 2010). It is a three-layered proﬁle, with effective\nunit weight, γ′, of 10 kN m−3 and varying angle of friction,\nφ′[◦], representing a medium-density sand. The stiffness of\nthe p–y curves increases proportionally with depth accord-\ning to the effective stress increase from the weight of soil. A\nrepresentation of the soil layers and pile dimensions is given\nin Fig. 9.\n4.3 Environmental conditions\nEnvironmental conditions, representing a possible site for\nmonopile installation in the North Sea have been used in\nthe analyses.

Waves and wind are unidirectional, normal to the ro-\ntor plane, as the focus of this study has been dynamics in the\nfore–aft plane. A presentation of wind and wave data is given\nin Table 1. Turbulence has been generated according to the\nMann turbulence model (Mann, 1998). Wind speed is given\nat the hub height, and a power law, with a wind shear expo-\nnent of 0.14, gives the wind proﬁle. Superposition of Airy\nwave components given by the JONSW AP spectrum with a\ngamma factor of 2.87 is used to generate the irregular wave\nkinematics.\nFigure 10 presents the overturning moment at mud-line\nfrom wind (with inertial forces) and waves for load case 6.\nThis is near rated conditions for the NREL 5 MW wind tur-\nbine.\n4.4 Calibration of soil-foundation models\n4.4.1 Calibration methodology\nThe calibration of all four models is based on the linearized\nfoundation stiffness used in Phase II of the comparison exer-\ncise IEA OC3 (Jonkman and Musial, 2010) to calibrate the\nlinear soil–structure interaction models.

To be consistent with the calibration of\nthe other models, the load-displacement curve from the\nFEAs was scaled to ﬁt the secant stiffness used in the\ncomparison exercise IEA OC3 at the load level deﬁned\nin Passon (2006). The FEAs were performed to estab-\nlish a realistic non-linear behaviour.\nFigure 9.Soil proﬁle and pile dimensions.\nFigure 10.Overturning moment at mud-line from wind and waves\nfrom load case 6.\nIn the following sections, the details of the calibration of each\nof the models are presented.\nwww.wind-energ-sci.net/2/361/2017/ Wind Energ.

Aasen et al.: Effect of foundation modelling on a monopile-based OWT\nFigure 11.Rotational stiffness characteristics for the different mod-\nels.\nFigure 12.Examples of p–ycurves from the different soil layers.\n4.4.2 Calibration of Model 1\nThe p–y curves generated by Passon (2006) for OC3\nPhase II, which follow the API sand model, have been used\nin this study with the purpose of benchmarking the study\nagainst industry practice. The reader is referred to Passon\n(2006) for more details. In the load region relevant for this\nstudy, the p–y curves show little non-linearity (Fig. 11). A\nselection of p–ycurves from the different soil layers is pre-\nsented in Fig. 12.\n4.4.3 Calibration of Model 2\nParameters for the foundation stiffness matrix have been de-\nﬁned based on the coupled-springs model of OC3 Phase II\n(Jonkman and Musial, 2010). Simple soil-foundation models\nwere calibrated for the project by Passon (2006). As stiffness\ncoefﬁcients were produced for a 2-D system, the stiffness\nmatrix has simply been extended to a 3-D system by using the\nsame stiffness coefﬁcients along both horizontal axes. Using\nthis approach, coupling effects between the two horizontal\naxes are neglected. This simpliﬁcation is examined later in\nthis paper.\nPasson (2006) estimated the stiffness coefﬁcients by cal-\nculating the secant pile stiffness at mud-line at a given load\nlevel with the geotechnical code LPILE. In these analyses,\nthe pile was modelled as a beam and the pile–soil interface\nand soil response were modelled as uncoupled lateral p–y\nsprings. The secant stiffness was calculated for 1.5 times the\nULS loads. This should be considered as a low stiffness esti-\nmate. The stiffness coefﬁcients are given in Eq.

Wind\nand waves are aligned with the x axis for all load cases in\nthis paper.\n4.4.4 Calibration of Model 3\nModel 3 uses the same stiffness matrix as Model 2, giving\nit the same stiffness proﬁle as Model 2. In addition, vis-\ncous rotational dampers have been included at the mud-line,\naround both horizontal axes, to account for soil damping\n(represented in a damping matrix at the mud-line node). The\nviscous dampers have been calibrated to give a foundation\ndamping factor of approximately 1 % near rated wind speed\nconditions (load case 6). This is considered reasonable and\nin line with studies from literature (Shirzadeh et al., 2013;\nCarswell et al., 2014). The foundation damping factor of 1 %\nexpresses the hysteretic energy loss in the soil as a percent-\nage of the total elastic strain energy of the soil. If the soil\ndamping factor is expressed as the hysteretic energy loss in\nthe soil as a percentage of the total strain energy of the com-\nplete OWT structure, the 1 % damping value would decrease\nto 0.3 %. The damping factor should not be confused with the\ndamping ratio, expressed as the percentage of critical damp-\ning. This deﬁnition is also used throughout the paper.\nTo see how soil damping affects fatigue damage, two other\ncalibrations for the damping coefﬁcients have been chosen,\ngiving foundation damping factors of 0.5 and 1.5 % near\nrated conditions (load case 6). The calibrations for the ro-\ntational dampers are given in Table 2. The damping coefﬁ-\ncients have been held constant for all load cases, as opposed\nto Model 4, where the inherent damping from hysteresis is\namplitude-dependent.\nWind Energ.

The analysis was per-\nformed with the geotechnical ﬁnite element software Plaxis\n3-D with approximately 45 000 10-node tetrahedral ele-\nments. Figure 13 illustrates the dimensions and the mesh re-\nﬁnement of the ﬁnite element model. Only half of the pile\nand the soil volume were modelled since both the geometry\nand the load acting on the pile are symmetric. A horizontal\nload of 1.955 MN was applied to half of the FE model. The\nhorizontal load–horizontal displacement curve at seabed was\ncompared with a FE model with signiﬁcantly reﬁned mesh\nand the discretization error was shown to be less than 1 % for\nthe load range considered in the study. This indicated that the\nmesh discretization used in the study is sufﬁcient.\nThe Hardening Soil Small Strain constitutive model\n(Benz, 2007; Brinkgreve et al., 2013) was used to repre-\nsent the sand behaviour. This constitutive model captures\nthe very small strain soil stiffness and its non-linear depen-\ndency on the strain amplitude, and it is suitable for anal-\nyses of geotechnical structures in sand subjected to small-\namplitude loading. Due to lack of soil test data, the param-\neters of the model were correlated from the relative density\nFigure 14.Computed moment–rotation curve at mud-line from ﬁ-\nnite element analyses and from the calibrated Model 4.

(2010). The relative densities of the sand\nlayers were derived from the friction angle ( ϕ′) documented\nin Passon (2006) through the expression\nφ′=28 +RD/8. (4)\nModel 4 was calibrated by ﬁtting the computed bending\nmoment–rotation curve at mud-line from ﬁnite element anal-\nyses, as illustrated in Fig. 14. The results from Passon (2006),\nused in the calibration of Models 2 and 3, are included as a\nreference. In addition, the comparison between the computed\nbending moment–horizontal displacement curve (Fig. 15)\nwas used to determine the point of application of Model 4.\nThe best ﬁt was obtained when Model 4 was located 10.0 m\nbelow mud-line. Figure 11 shows the stiffness of Model 4,\ncompared with the other models. Seen relative to the other\nmodels, it gives a stiffer behaviour for low load levels and\nsofter behaviour for higher load levels.\n4.5 Fatigue damage calculations\nFatigue damage can be evaluated in both the time and fre-\nquency domains. For time domain simulations, the S-N\ncurve methodology is widely used and is brieﬂy described\nbelow. Frequency domain simulations can also be performed\nusing Dirlik’s method. A comparison between these meth-\nods can be found in Ragan and Manuel (2007). More details\non spectral methods for fatigue assessment can be found in\nYeter et al. (2013) and Michalopoulos (2015).\nIn this study fatigue damage has been calculated by the S-\nN curve approach, using Palmgren–Miner’s rule according\nto DNV standards (DNV , 2010). S-N curves give the num-\nber of cycles before failure for given stress ranges,1σ. With\nvariable stress ranges, linear cumulative damage is assumed,\naccording to Palmgren–Miner’s rule.

Results have been\nextrapolated to ﬁnd the accumulated fatigue damage per year.\n5 Analysis\n5.1 Model characteristics from free vibration tests\nA free vibration test was performed to identify the basic char-\nacteristics of the foundation models in terms of stiffness and\nTable 3.S-Ncurve parameters.\nAir (tower root) Seawater with cathodic\nprotection (mud-line)\nN< 107 N> 107 N< 106 N> 106\nlog10a 11.546 14.576 11.146 14.576\nm 3.0 5.0 3.0 5.0\nk 0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25\ntref 25 mm 25 mm 25 mm 25 mm\nFigure 16. Free vibration test with a tower top displacement of\n0.2 m.\ndamping (Fig. 16). A forced displacement of 0.2 m at the\ntower top was applied and released, and then the tower was\nallowed to vibrate freely. This leads to some disturbances\nin the ﬁrst cycles due to energy exchange between differ-\nent modes, as can be seen in Fig. 17. The load amplitudes\nin the free vibration test are representative for load cases 6–\n15. Damping characteristics of the models are presented in\nFig. 17. The eigenfrequencies (based on the time between\ntwo consecutive peaks) are presented in Fig. 18.\nModels 2 and 3 give the same ﬁrst natural fore–aft fre-\nquency for the structure, as the mud-line stiffness is the same.\nModels 1 and 4 show stiffer behaviour, as a result of both the\ncalibration methodology and load level. In Figs. 17 and 18 it\ncan be seen how Model 4 gives lower damping and increased\nstiffness, as the loading amplitude decreases, which is more\nrealistic behaviour compared to the other models.\nThe damping contribution from the different models is\nquantiﬁed by the global damping ratio, which is given as a\npercentage of critical damping. It includes soil, structural,\naerodynamic, and hydrodynamic damping. Only Models 3\nand 4 account for soil damping. As damping sources other\nthan soil damping are the same for all models, the differences\nare due the damping properties of the soil-foundation mod-\nels. The soil damping factor for Model 3 is constantly 0.3 %,\nand for Model 4 it varies between 0.05 and 0.3 %.\n5.2 Foundation model impact on fatigue damage\nThe total accumulated fatigue damage per year is plotted in\nFig. 19, with the expected fatigue lifetime in years (y) at\nWind Energ.

It can be seen that Model 2 gives\nthe highest fatigue damage, and Model 4 the lowest, with\na reduction of 22 % relative to Model 2. The reduction is a\nconsequence of a favourable increase in both stiffness and\ndamping in Model 4 compared to Model 2. While a slightly\nlarger stiffness in Models 2 and 3 could have moderated this\nconclusion, the results support the value of using non-linear\nhysteretic models that automatically account for the soil re-\nsponse in different load regimes. A comparison of Models 2\nand 3 shows how soil damping by itself inﬂuences fatigue\ndamage. Models 2, 3a, b, and c are identical in their stiff-\nness properties; therefore, the differences in fatigue damage\nmust be a consequence of the damping properties of the mod-\nels. Table 2 shows the damping properties of Model 3a, b\nand c, with foundation damping factors of 0.5, 1, and 1.5 %.\nModel 3b with a foundation damping factor of 1 % reduces\nfatigue damage by 8 % relative to Model 2.\nComparing the p–y curve approach (Model 1) with the\nlinear elastic model (Model 2), it can be seen how the calibra-\ntion methodology for the p–ycurves is favourable to that of\nModel 2. Model 1 gives stiffer soil behaviour in the working\nload regions, making it favourable in terms of fatigue dam-\nage. As a consequence of this, the softer Model 2 takes the\nnatural frequency of the structure closer to wave frequencies\nthan the stiffer Model 1, thereby increasing resonance effects.\nFigure 19.Accumulated fatigue damage at mud-line.\nFigure 20.Accumulated fatigue damage at mud-line arranged by\nload case.\nFigure 20 presents the relative accumulated fatigue dam-\nage by load case. Results are normalized relative to the high-\nest value. Each load case is also probability weighed accord-\ning to Table 1.\nIt can be seen how the foundation models have the highest\nimpact on idling cases (LC 1 and 13–15). This has mainly\ntwo reasons: (1) LC 1 and LC 13–15 are load cases where\nthe rotor is idling, and as a consequence aerodynamic damp-\ning is highly reduced. Thus, the soil damping has a higher\nshare of the total damping of the system. (2) Load ampli-\ntudes are higher. This leads to more damping from Model 4,\nwhile damping from Model 3a to c is unchanged.\nLoad case 1 has an impact on the total fatigue damage.\nThis might seem counterintuitive, as wind and wave con-\nditions are mild. However, with the rotor idle and limited\naerodynamic damping, the tower is free to oscillate at its\nﬁrst natural frequency, leading to high load amplitudes at\nthe mud-line. Together with a high probability of occurrence,\nthis gives a signiﬁcant contribution to the total fatigue dam-\nage (8 % for Model 4, approximately the same as LC4)\nFigure 21 shows the fatigue presented again, but this time\nwithout taking the probability of occurrence into account, in\nother words, the fatigue per unit time for the given environ-\nmental condition. Except for LC1, the trend is clear; increas-\ning wind speeds and wave heights lead to higher fatigue dam-\nage. To illustrate the effect of aerodynamic damping, LC2\nwww.wind-energ-sci.net/2/361/2017/ Wind Energ. Sci., 2, 361–376, 2017\n372 S.

The mud-line bending\nmoment rms increased by a factor 2. Examples of mud-line\nmoment time series for LC2 and LC2b are shown in Fig. 22.\nFatigue damage calculations at the tower root (10 m above\nstill water line) are given in Figs. 23 and 24. Absolute val-\nues are highly reduced, but the relative effect of the soil-\nfoundation model on fatigue damage is even higher at this\nlocation. The trends are similar to what was observed at the\nmud-line.\nCalculations were also done for the tower top and blade\nroot. As the soil-foundation model had very little impact here\n(<1 % change in fatigue damage), the results are not in-\ncluded in this paper. The differences in tower top motions due\nto foundation differences are not large enough to inﬂuence\nthe rotor fatigue loads, driven by 3P tower blockage effects,\n1P gravity loads and wind shear (for the blade roots), and\nturbulence. Relatively small changes in overall rotor loads,\nhowever, will inﬂuence the bending moments and stresses at\nthe mud-line due to the long moment arm.\nFigure 23.Accumulated fatigue damage at tower root.\nFigure 24.Accumulated fatigue damage at tower root arranged by\nload case.\n5.3 Neglecting coupling between longitudinal and lateral\nmotions for the soil models\nFor non-linear models of soil response to pile motions, cou-\npling terms do arise for large combined longitudinal and lat-\neral motions. This has not been implemented in the current\nstudy; the models have simply been applied independently\nalong the two horizontal axes. For all load cases, the waves\nand wind are aligned with the xaxis. The highest transversal\nmotions relative to longitudinal motions are seen for LC15.\nFigure 25 shows the trajectory of the mud-line node, with\ntransversal motions up to about two-thirds of the longitudi-\nnal motions.\nTo test the validity of ignoring the coupling between the\nhorizontal motions, a run with wind, waves, and rotor aligned\nwith the xaxis was compared with a corresponding run with\nwind, waves, and rotor rotated at 45◦. The longitudinal (roll)\nand transversal (pitch) moment components are compared in\nFigs. 26 and 27. The changes are small, and the approxima-\ntion seems to be acceptable for the cases in this work. For\nfuture cases with offsets between wind and wave directions,\nhowever, this assumption should be revisited.\nWind Energ. Sci., 2, 361–376, 2017 www.wind-energ-sci.net/2/361/2017/\nS.

This\npaper compares four soil-foundation models: the current in-\ndustry standard (Model 1), a linear elastic model (Model 2),\na linear elastic model that includes damping (Model 3), and\na non-linear hysteretic model (Model 4).\nModel 1 is the industry standard today. Non-linear springs\n(p–y curves) are attached at several levels below the mud-\nline. The model represents the non-linear behaviour of the\nsoil, but neglects soil damping. The calibration taken from\nthe IEA OC3 project gives a slightly stiffer foundation at\nlow load levels compared with the linear elastic models 2\nand 3. A stiffer foundation increases the ﬁrst tower natural\nfrequency, leading to an increased margin to the wave exci-\ntation frequencies. Despite having no foundation damping,\nFigure 27.Roll moment for wind–wave direction 0 and 45◦.\nModel 1 gives about the same fatigue damage as Model 3b\n(linear elastic with damping) due to the higher stiffness.\nModel 2, a stiffness matrix adopted from the IEA OC3\nproject applied at the mud-line, with different levels of damp-\ning (Model 3a, b and c), also applied at the mud-line, demon-\nstrate how increased foundation damping levels reduce fa-\ntigue damage for all load cases. This is because the ﬁrst natu-\nral frequency of tower bending is relatively close to the wave\nfrequencies, making small changes in damping important for\nthe response. For the idle cases, with limited aerodynamic\ndamping, the resonant response becomes even more sensi-\ntive to small changes in foundation damping. Compared to\nModel 2 (linear elastic with no damping) the total fatigue\ndamage was reduced by 13 % when adding a foundation\ndamping factor of 0.3 % (Model 3b).\nThe non-linear hysteretic Model 4 reduces fatigue damage\nas a consequence of both its damping and stiffness properties.\nModel 4 is stiffer when the loading amplitude is small, which\nis true for the majority of operational time. This brings the\nnatural frequency of the system away from the wave frequen-\ncies, resulting in less resonance effects. Model 4 includes\ndamping as a function of load amplitude due to hysteresis,\ngiving more damping at high load levels. Both effects reduce\nthe load amplitude. Compared to Model 1 ( p–ycurves) and\nModel 2 (linear elastic), the accumulated fatigue damage at\nmud-line was reduced by 11 and 22 %, respectively.\nThe changes in fatigue damage due to the different foun-\ndation models in this study can to a large extent be explained\nin terms of how appropriate the stiffness and damping lev-\nels are for the load cases at hand. It can therefore be ar-\ngued that Models 1 and 3, tuned to groups of load cases,\nwould give similar results for fatigue damage as the more de-\ntailed Model 4. We nevertheless recommend Model 4, where\nthe non-linear hysteretic behaviour observed in piled foun-\ndations is accounted for. This gives stiffness and damping\nproperties changing according to the different load levels, re-\nducing the need for recalibration for the different load cases.\nwww.wind-energ-sci.net/2/361/2017/ Wind Energ. Sci., 2, 361–376, 2017\n374 S. Aasen et al.: Effect of foundation modelling on a monopile-based OWT\nThis study, along with other studies of bottom-ﬁxed off-\nshore wind turbines, has brought the attention to idling cases,\nwhere the absence of aerodynamic damping and high prob-\nability of occurrence gives both a high contribution to the\ntotal fatigue damage, and a high sensitivity to the founda-\ntion model. The study used a lumped wind–wave diagram,\nwith both wind and waves acting in the same direction. This\nshould be revisited in the continuation of this work, as cases\nwith offsets between wind and wave directions could lead\nto relatively high excitation from the waves and low aero-\ndynamic damping in the direction of the waves. The details\nof the foundation model could become even more important\nhere.\nData availability.
