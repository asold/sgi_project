To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to\nsystematicallyanalyzethisproblem.Weevaluate12different\nmodels, ranging from closed GPT-3 series models (OpenAI\n2023) to open models including Fairseq MoE (Artetxe et al.\n2022), GPT-J (Wang and Komatsuzaki 2021), Bloom (Scao\net al. 2022), OPT (Zhang et al. 2022) , LLaMA (Touvron\net al. 2023), Alpaca (Taori et al. 2023), and Vicuna (Chiang\netal.2023)on16classificationtasksand1semanticparsing\ntask.\nWeanalyzeeachmodelondatasetscreatedbeforeitstrain-\ning data was crawled on the internet versus datasets created\nafterward.

This is strong evidence\nthat the performance increase in zero-shot performance on\nthis task is due to task contamination.\nAdditionally, we look closely at the GPT-3 series mod-\nels. We find that training examples can be extracted from\nthe GPT-3 models, and that the number of extractable train-\ning examples increased from each version fromdavinci\nto GPT-3.5-turbo, and closely tracks the increase in\nzero-shot performance of the GPT-3 models on that task\n(Fig. 2). This is strong evidence that the increase in perfor-\nmance on this task across GPT-3 models fromdavinci to\nGPT-3.5-turbo is due to task contamination.\n2 Overview\nWe employ four methods of measuring task contamination.\n1. Training data inspection: Search through the training\ndata to find task training examples.\n2. Task data extraction: Extract task data from an exist-\ning model. Extraction is only possible with instruction-\ntuned models. This analysis can also be done for training\ndata or testing data extraction (Sainz et al. 2023b). Note:\nForthepurposesofdetectingtaskcontamination,theex-\ntracted task data need not exactly match existing train-\ning data examples. Any training examples demonstrating\nthetaskindicatepossiblecontaminationforzeroandfew-\nshot learning.\n3. Membership inference: This method only applies to\ngeneration tasks. Check if the model generated content\nfor an input instance is exactly the same as the original\ndataset (Hu et al. 2022a). If there is an exact match, we\ncan infer it is a member of the LLM’s training data. This\ndiffers from task data extraction because generated out-\nput is checked for an exact match. Exact matches for an\nopen-ended generation task strongly indicate the model\nhas seen those examples during training. The model is\nnot just good, it is psychic: it has knowledge of the exact\nphrasing used in the data. Note: this can only be used for\ngeneration tasks.2\n4.

We use this division to analyze the zero-shot or\nfew-shot performance difference between older datasets and\nnewer ones, with the same division applied for all LLMs.\nWe also use the per-LLM divisionpre-collection and post-\ncollection datasets, which distinguishes datasets that the\nmodelwaspossiblytrainedon(pre-collectiondatasets)from\nthedatasetsitcouldnothavebeentrainedon(post-collection\ndatasets).

We find that for datasets\nreleasedpriortothecreationoftheLLM,itismorelikelythe\nLLM beats the majority baseline for both zero and few-shot\nsettings. Using the Mann-Whitney U test (Mann and Whit-\nney1947),wefindthedifferenceinthoseabovethemajority\nbaseline between pre- and post-collection populations to be\nstatistically significant at the 99% confidence level for both\nzero and few shot settings.\nForsomedatasetsandmodels,theperformancedifference\nabove the majority baseline is small, so we also perform\nthe same comparison counting datasets for which the results\nabovethemajoritybaselinearestatisticallysignificantatthe\n99% level, calculated using the student t-test (Student 1908)\n(Fig.1,darker).Again,wefindthatfordatasetsreleasedprior\ntothecreationoftheLLM,itisfarmorelikelytheLLMbeats\nthe majority baseline with statistical significance for both\nzero and few-shot settings. Similarly, the Mann-Whitney U\ntest indicates these differences between pre and post are sta-\ntisticallysignificantatthe99%confidencelevelforbothzero\nand few shot settings.\nThese results indicate the possibility of task contamina-\ntion for both open LLMs and GPT-3 series LLMs, with a\nstrongerindicationofcontaminationintheGPT-3serieswith\ndavinci-001 and after.\n5The majority baseline for a classification task is the perfor-\nmance of a model that labels every example with the label that oc-\ncurs most often in the dataset.\nThe Thirty-Eighth AAAI Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AAAI-24)\n18473\ndavinci\n2019(9)\ndavinci-001\n2019(9)\ndavinci-002\n2021(12)\ndavinci-003\n2021(12)\nGPT-3.5-T\n2021(12)\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100Percentage larger than majority baseline\nzero-shot\nfew-shot\nzero-shot stat. sig.\nfew-shot stat. sig.\nT ask Extraction\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nPercentage of tasks can be extracted\n(a) GPT-3 series on pre-collection datasets\ndavinci\n2019(7)\ndavinci-001\n2019(7)\ndavinci-002\n2021(4)\ndavinci-003\n2021(4)\nGPT-3.5-T\n2021(4)\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100Percentage larger than majority baseline\nzero-shot\nfew-shot\nzero-shot stat. sig.\nfew-shot stat. sig.\nT ask Extraction\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nPercentage of tasks can be extracted (b) GPT-3 series on post-collection datasets\nMoE\n2019(9)\nGPT-J\n2020(9)\nOPT\n2021(12)\nBLOOM\n2022(13)\nLLaMA\n2022(13)\nAlpaca\n2022(13)\nVicuna\n2022(13)\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100Percentage larger than majority baseline\nzero-shot\nfew-shot\nzero-shot stat. sig.\nfew-shot stat. sig.\nT ask Extraction\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nPercentage of tasks can be extracted\n(c) Open LLMs on pre-collection datasets\nMoE\n2019(7)\nGPT-J\n2020(7)\nOPT\n2021(4)\nBLOOM\n2022(3)\nLLaMA\n2022(3)\nAlpaca\n2022(3)\nVicuna\n2022(3)\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100Percentage larger than majority baseline\nzero-shot\nfew-shot\nzero-shot stat. sig.\nfew-shot stat. sig.\nT ask Extraction\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nPercentage of tasks can be extracted (d) Open LLMs on post-collection datasets\nFigure2:PercentageofdatasetslargerthanmajoritybaselinesforeachLLM(lightcolor),aswellasthepercentageoftasksfor\nwhichtrainingdatacanbeextractedwithaninstructionprompt(Red,seealsoTable4).Darkcoloristhepercentageofdatasets\nsignificantly larger (𝑝= .99) than the majority baseline using the student t-test. The number in parentheses is the total number\nof datasets for that LLM that belongs in pre- or post-collection (e.g. MoE has 7 datasets post its training collection date.) For\ntasks with no possibility of task contamination (post-collection datasets (b) and (d), with no extracted task examples in red),\nmodels rarely demonstrate statistically significant improvements over majority baselines, in both zero and few-shot settings.\nCaveats There are two considerations we need to make in\nthe global chronological analysis.\nFirst, datasets may have become more difficult over time,\nmeaning LLMs are less likely to outperform the majority\nbaseline despite the lack of task contamination. To account\nfor this, we carefully review the tasks and remove tasks\nknown to be difficult for LLMs, such as GSM8K (Cobbe\net al. 2021) and TrackingShuffledObjects (Srivastava et al.\n2022). The remaining datasets all have decent performance\nusing fine-tuned pretrained language models (PLMs), and,\nimportantly,thereisnocorrelationbetweenreleasedateand\nthe performance of fine-tuned PLMs (𝑅2 = 0.001) on our\ndatasets, as shown in Fig. 4.\nSecondly, post-collection datasets, despite being released\nafter data collection, may still cause contamination. For ex-\nample, the FOMC dataset (Shah, Paturi, and Chava 2023)\nwas officially released post-collection for the GPT-3 series,\nbut its performance on subsequent versions is notably high.\nThis may be the result of the authors’ preliminary experi-\nmentationwiththeGPT-3series(asstatedintheirpaper),as\nOpenAI may have then utilized their experimental data for\nmodel updates.\nAnalysis of Pre- and Post-collection for Individual\nLLMs\nInthissection,weconsidertheperformanceonpre-andpost-\ncollection datasets for each LLM individually (see Fig. 2).\nWe find the difference in performance between the two cat-\negories to be statistically significant at 95% confidence ac-\ncording to the paired sign test (Dixon and Mood 1946).\nWe plot the percentage of datasets larger than the major-\nity baseline as in the last section, but for each LLM indi-\nThe Thirty-Eighth AAAI Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AAAI-24)\n18474\ndavinci\n2019\ndavinci-001\n2019\ndavinci-002\n2021\ndavinci-003\n2021\nGPT-3.5-turbo\n2021\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0average accuracy\nzero-shot few-shot majority fine-tune\n(a) GPT-3 series on pre-2021 datasets.\ndavinci\n2019\ndavinci-001\n2019\ndavinci-002\n2021\ndavinci-003\n2021\nGPT-3.5-turbo\n2021\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0average accuracy\nzero-shot few-shot majority fine-tune (b) GPT-3 series on post-2021 datasets.\nMoE\n2019\nGPT-J\n2020\nOPT\n2021\nBLOOM\n2022\nLLaMA\n2022\nAlpaca\n2022\nVicuna\n2022\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0average accuracy\nzero-shot few-shot majority fine-tune\n(c) Open LLMs on pre-2021 datasets.\nMoE\n2019\nGPT-J\n2020\nOPT\n2021\nBLOOM\n2022\nLLaMA\n2022\nAlpaca\n2022\nVicuna\n2022\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0average accuracy\nzero-shot few-shot majority fine-tune (d) Open LLMs on post-2021 datasets.\nFigure 3: Average performance on datasets pre/post-2021.\nTask Release Year\nAccuracy on fine-tuning LM\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\n2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 2020 2022\nAccuracy on fine-tuning LM   R² = 0.001\nFigure 4: Task accuracy of a fine-tuned LLM baseline vs.\ntask release year.𝑅2 = .001, which indicates that the task\ndifficulty for our datasets does not increase over time.\nvidually. The results are shown in Fig. 2. We observe that\ntheglobaltrendfromtheprevioussectionhasremainedtrue\nacross models with the full range of dates, further indicat-\ning that the absolute date of the dataset is not the main fac-\ntor, but rather the date of the dataset relative to the training\ndata collection date for the LLM is the more important fac-\ntor. (Note: because of the recency of LLaMA, Alpaca, and\nVicuna,wehavefewerdatasetsinourexperimentsposttheir\ntraining data collection date).\nImportantly, we find that for tasks with no possibility of\ntask contamination, models do not demonstrate statistically\nsignificant improvements over majority baselines, in both\nzeroandfew-shotsettings.Theexceptionis davinci-001\non post-collection datasets, which shows a statistically\nsignificant improvement over one post-collection dataset\n(MTSC-RW,asentimentclassificationdataset),butdoesnot\ngenerate task examples with our prompt (Table 4).\nPerformance over Time\nNext we perform a chronological analysis that examines the\nchangeinaverageperformanceovertimeforbothGPT-3se-\nries and open LLMs (Fig. 3). To also be sensitive to time\nof the datasets, we split our datasets into two sets: datasets\nreleased before or after January 1st, 2021, identified aspre-\n2021datasets andpost-2021datasets, respectively.\nPre-2021Datasets ForopenLLMs,onpre-2021datasets,\nwe see a slight increase over time for open LLMs (Fig. 3c).\nThe Thirty-Eighth AAAI Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AAAI-24)\n18475\nWe find that the performance hovers around the majority\nbaseline for both zero and few-shot settings, and does not\nincrease very much from LLM data collection dates ranging\nfrom 2019 to 2022.\nFor the GPT-3 series, on the other hand, the trend on pre-\n2021datasetsisparticularlysuspect(Fig.3a).Weseethatfor\npriorGPT-3datasets,theperformancehasincreaseddramat-\nically over time, with laterdavinci models much higher\nthan the majority baseline for both zero and few-shot set-\ntings.ThecomparisontoopenLLMsindicatesthatzeroand\nfewshotevaluationsmayhavetaskcontaminationissuesdue\nto data collected from user inputs.\nPost-2021 Datasets For post-2021 datasets, GPT-3 aver-\nage performance has also increased over time (Fig. 3b), par-\nticularly in the zero-shot setting. This makes sense, as many\nof the post-2021 datasets are released prior the training data\ncollectiondateforthelater davinci models.(Toseewhich\ndatasets are pre- or post- training data collection time, see\nthe line separating pre- and post- collection datasets in Ta-\nble4.)OpenLLMsaverageperformancealsoincreasedover\ntime, but they remain lower than the majority baseline and\nthe GPT-3 series.\nOne could hypothesize that the high performance of the\nGPT-3 series is due to instruction tuning (Ouyang et al.\n2022), however we do not believe this is the case. While we\nobserveanincreaseinperformancefrom davinci-001 to\ndavinci-002 onpre-2021datasets,thereisacorrespond-\ning decrease in performance on post-2021 datasets, which\nwemeasurewiththesigntesttobestatisticallysignificantat\nthe 95%. This demonstrates that the GPT-3 series instruc-\ntion tuning is specific to certain earlier datasets, and sug-\ngestsdatasetcontaminationforzeroandfew-shotevaluation\nof GPT-3 series.\n5 Training Data Inspection\nTosearchfordirectevidenceoftaskcontamination,wecon-\nduct training data inspection on two instruction fine-tuned\nopen LLMs (Alpaca and Vicuna) for all experimented clas-\nsification tasks. We search for task-related instruction pat-\nterns in the training data, and manually inspect them to see\nif they contain task training examples. We then compare the\nperformance to see if more task-specific training examples\nhasboostedperformance.Becausewemustcheckmanually,\nwe can perform this analysis only for the small fine-tuning\ndatasets of Alpaca and Vicuna.\nTable 3 shows the number of task examples on Alpaca\nand Vicuna, as well as the change in performance averaged\noverzeroandfew-shotsettings.Wefindthatperformancehas\nimproved for Alpaca and Vicuna over the original LLaMA\nmodel for tasks with task examples. This indicates that the\nperformance can be improved with small sets of task exam-\nplesinthetrainingdata,whichcancompromisezero-shotor\nfew-shot evaluation.\n6 Task Data Extraction\nWe test for task data contamination by attempting to extract\ntask data from the LLM.

While this test is possible for gen-\neration tasks, it is not possible for classification tasks, since\ninputsmaybeinthetrainingdataofLLMs(andlikelyare,for\nmany datasets), but we do not know for certain if the inputs\nare also paired with the labels without looking at the train-\ningdata.Weuse Spider,asemanticparsingandtext-to-SQL\ngeneration task, (Yu et al. 2018) as our target for analysis.\nFig. 5a and Fig. 5b show how many generated examples\nfrom the sampled training set and full development set are\nexactlythesameoverversionsoftheGPT-3seriesandrecent\nopensourcedLLMs,respectively.Thedatabaseschemasare\nnot in the zero-shot prompts, so if the model can generate\nexactly the same table name or field name as found in the\ntraining or development data, there must be contamination.\nAs shown in Fig. 5, the number of exact matched generated\nexamples increases over time, which indicates the extent of\nthe task contamination onSpider is increasing.\nWe also compute the execution accuracy after adding the\nschema in the prompts, and plot it against the number of ex-\nact matched generations (Fig. 6). We find a strong positive\ncorrelation between the number of exact matched generated\nexamples and execution accuracy (𝑅= 0.88), strongly in-\ndicating increased contamination is related to increased per-\nformance. However, we still cannot determine the extent of\nthecontamination’seffectonperformanceimprovement.We\nleave this for future work.\n8 Take-Aways\nWe now share some takeaways which our experiments have\nbrought to light:\n• Due to task contamination, closed-sourced models may\ndemonstrate inflated performance in zero-shot or few-\nshot evaluation, and are therefore not trustworthy base-\nlines in these settings, especially those including instruc-\ntion fine-tuning or reinforcement learning with human\nfeedback(RLHF).Theextentofthiscontaminationisstill\nunknown, and we therefore recommend caution.\n• In our experiments, for tasks with no possibility of task\ncontamination, models rarely demonstrate statistically\nsignificantimprovementsovermajoritybaselines,inboth\nzero and few-shot settings.\n• The observed increase over time of GPT-3 series mod-\nelsforzero-shotorfew-shotperformanceformanydown-\nstream tasks is likely due to task contamination.\n• Inspectionfortaskcontaminationoftrainingdataevenfor\nopen-sourced LLMs can be difficult for several reasons.\nFirst,determiningmembershipisdifficultunlessthepro-\ncesseddatasetusedfortrainingtheLLMisreleased(e.g.,\nOPT and LLaMA did not release the data they used to\ntrain the model, but Alpaca and Vicuna did, so we can\nobtain more definite information). Second, we cannot al-\nwaysrelyonthemodeltoreproduceevidenceofcontam-\ninationevenifitexists.Andthird,formattingdifferences\n(suchasCSVandJSON)ofadatasetcomplicateanalysis.\n• We encourage publicly releasing training datasets to al-\nlow for easier diagnosing of contamination issues.\n9 Related Work\nThe investigation into potential data contamination in large\nlanguagemodels(LLMs)hasrecentlybeengainingattention\nintheresearchcommunity.Brownetal.(2020),intheirwork\nwith GPT-3, presented an in-depth analysis of data contam-\nination. Although they acknowledged the presence of a bug\nthatledtodatacontaminationinmultipledatasets,theirposi-\ntion was that it did not affect the overall performance of the\nmodel. Intriguingly, they noted that contaminated datasets\noutperformedtheuncontaminatedoneswhich,inaway,con-\ntradictedtheiroriginalassertion.MagarandSchwartz(2022)\nextracted training data from GPT-2 and indicated poten-\ntial leaks of private data in the pre-trained language model.\nChang et al. (2023) discovered that OpenAI models were\nmemorizing substantial amounts of copyrighted materials,\nwhich increased concern over data contamination. Aiyappa\net al. (2023) highlighted the severity and scope of data con-\ntaminationproblemsforChatGPTevaluations.Highlighting\nthe need for strategic interventions to address these issues,\nJacovi et al. (2023) proposed several strategies for circum-\nventingtestingdatacontamination.Additionalworkhasfur-\nther looked into test data contamination (Sainz et al. 2023b;\nZhou et al. 2023; Golchin and Surdeanu 2023; Sainz et al.\n2023a; Deng et al. 2023; Oren et al. 2023; Li 2023).\nThe previous work listed above has investigated test data\ncontamination,buthasnotconsideredtaskcontaminationfor\nzero-shot or few-shot settings. Prior work has noticed our\nproposed task contamination problem for zero-shot or few-\nshot learning (Blevins, Gonen, and Zettlemoyer 2023; Bri-\nakou, Cherry, and Foster 2023), but did not systematically\nanalyze it. Our work seeks to add to the existing knowledge\nbyprovidinganexhaustiveevaluationoftaskcontamination\nfor few-shot or zero-shot learning scenarios.\n10 Conclusion and Future Work\nWe investigate task contamination for LLMs, and conduct a\nchronologicalanalysis,trainingdatainspection,trainingdata\nextraction, and a membership inference attack to analyze it.\nWe find evidence that some LLMs have seen task examples\nduring pre-training for a range of tasks, and are therefore no\nlongerzeroorfew-shotforthesetasks.Additionally,wefind\nthat for tasks without the possibility of task contamination,\nmodels rarely demonstrate statistically significant improve-\nments over simple majority baselines, in both zero and few-\nshot settings. We recommend additional research be con-\nducted on task contamination for zero and few-shot settings\nto reveal the extent and impact of the task contamination for\nlarge language models in these settings.\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful for valuable feedback from Nilay Patel on\nan earlier version of this draft.
