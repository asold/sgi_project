In its original context [ 1], the duality was conjectured for\nstring/M theory on AdSd+1 \u0002X, with a compact internal manifold X, and conformal \feld\ntheory (CFT) living on d-dimensional boundary of the AdS space. Having the application\nto realistic theories like QCD in mind, the extension of the conjecture to non-conformal\n\feld theories was pursued soon after [ 4]. In particular, the conjecture was extended to\nQFTs that are obtained from the CFTs either by adding relevant operators to the ac-\ntion or considering vacua where the conformal symmetries are broken spontaneously. A\nd-dimensional QFT, which is obtained as a result of either of those deformations, is dual to\na string/M theory on a spacetime geometry which is asymptotically AdSd+1 \u0002X. However,\nthere is no complete formulation of string/M theory on a curved background. Hence, the\nduality is mainly tested in the limit of a weakly curved classical gravity, which corresponds\nto taking the limits of large N as well as large 't Hooft coupling constant \u0015, N being the\nrank of the gauge group.\nOne of the tests of gauge/gravity duality involves the calculation of the vacuum ex-\npectation values (vevs) of gauge invariant operators in the large N and \u0015 limits. On\nthe \feld theory side, the calculation follows the usual perturbation expansion where the\ndivergences in the bare quantities are subtracted using the standard renormalization proce-\ndure. When those gauge invariant operators are chiral primary operators (CPOs) in highly\nsupersymmetric gauge theories, the vevs are protected from quantum corrections by the su-\npersymmetry and they are determined in the classical limit. The corresponding procedure\non the gravity side goes as follows. Given a supergravity solution which is asymptotically\nAdSd+1 \u0002X, it is expanded in terms of harmonic functions on the compact manifold.\nThe compacti\fcation results in towers of Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes in ( d+ 1)-dimensional\ngravity theory. The gauge/gravity correspondence dictates that for every gauge invariant\noperator on the \feld theory side there is a corresponding gravity \feld among these KK\nmodes. The vev of the gauge invariant operator is then determined by applying the holo-\ngraphic renormalization procedure [ 5{12] to those KK modes in the ( d+ 1)-dimensional\ngravity theory [ 13{15]. For a CPO of conformal dimension \u0001, the vev which is obtained\nusing this procedure is proportional to the coe\u000ecient of z\u0001 in the asymptotic expansion of\nthe dual scalar \feld, z being the holographic coordinate of the AdS space. This procedure\nwas implemented to determine the vevs of CPOs in the Coulomb branch of theN= 4 super\nYang-Mills (SYM) theory and the dual type IIB string theory on a spacetime geometry\nwhich is asymptotically AdS 5 \u0002S5 [13, 14].\nIn [ 16], we reported a summary of our work which shows an exact gauge/gravity\nduality relation for large N. Our analysis is based on the 3-dimensional mass-deformed\nAharony-Bergman-Ja\u000beris-Maldacena theory (mABJM) of massive M2-branes, which has\nN= 6 supersymmetry and Uk(N)\u0002U\u0000k(N) gauge symmetry, wherekis the Chern-Simons\nlevel [17, 18]. The mass-deformed theory is obtained from the original ABJM theory [ 19]\nby adding a relevant deformation which preserves the full supersymmetry as well as the\n{ 2 {\nJHEP04(2017)104\ngauge symmetry while the conformal symmetry is completely broken and the SU(4) global\nsymmetry is reduced to SU(2)\u0002SU(2)\u0002U(1). The mABJM theory supports sets of discrete\nHiggs vacua, which are expressed in terms of the GRVV matrices with numerical valued\nmatrix elements [18]. The calculation of the vevs of CPOs in the large N limit is possible\ndue to the existence of these discrete vacua.\nSince the mABJM theory is obtained from the deformation of a CFT by relevant\noperators, the spacetime geometry of the dual gravity theory should be asymptotically\nAdS4 \u0002X. It was predicted that for the gauge theory describing massive M2-branes,\nthe dual gravity theory is M-theory on the 11-dimensional Lin-Lunin-Maldacena (LLM)\ngeometry [20, 21]. Indeed, the LLM geometry with Zk orbifold and SO(2;1) \u0002SO(4)=Zk\u0002\nSO(4)=Zk isometry is asymptotically AdS 4 \u0002S7=Zk. In line with this prediction a one-to-\none correspondence between the vacua of the mABJM theory and the LLM geometry was\nobtained [22, 23]. See also [ 24{29] for related works.\nIn this paper, we quantitatively test the above gauge/gravity duality in terms of the\nvevs of CPOs. On the \feld theory side, some of the classical vacuum solutions are pro-\ntected from quantum corrections due to the high number of supersymmetry. The vevs of\nCPOs are determined by those supersymmetric vacua. We calculate the vevs of the CPO\nwith conformal dimension \u0001 = 1 for all possible supersymmetric vacua of the mABJM\ntheory for large N and general k. On the gravity theory side, we start with equations of\nmotion on AdS 4 \u0002S7 background in 11-dimensional supergravity. In order to obtain the\n4-dimensional equations of motion, we implement the KK reduction procedure on S7. The\nLLM solutions were obtained in some unknown gauge. In order to solve the 4-dimensional\nequations using the LLM solutions, we need to write the equations with gauge invariant\ncombinations for KK modes. 1 In general, the KK reduction leads to cubic or higher order\ninteraction terms among the KK modes, which results in non-linear equations of motion.\nWhen we are interested only in the CPO with conformal dimension \u0001 = 1, the linearized\nequations are su\u000ecient. However, for CPOs with \u0001 \u00152, one has to consider non-linear\nequations [32], where some non-trivial \feld rede\fnitions are required to relate 4-dimensional\nand 11-dimensional \felds. See [ 13, 33{35] for non-linear results on the AdS 5 \u0002S5 back-\nground. Here we focus on the \u0001 = 1 case. According to the gauge/gravity dictionary [ 2, 3],\nwe read the vevs from the asymptotic expansions of the KK scalar modes. As a result, we\nobtain an exact holographic relation which is given by\nhO(\u0001=1)i= N\n3\n2 f(\u0001=1); (1.1)\nwhere we consider the k= 1 case, f(\u0001) is a function of the conformal dimensions and also\ndepends on some parameters of the LLM solutions, but does not depend on N. For a given\nN the number of supersymmetric vacua is equal to the partition of N and the above result\nis valid for all supersymmetric vacua [22, 23]. We also extend this result to k> 1, however,\nfor some speci\fc types of the LLM solutions.\n1For the linearized equations of motion on AdS 4 \u0002S7 background in de Donder gauge, see [ 30, 31]. It is\nimportant to note that, recovering the equations of motion of gauge invariant \felds from those of the \felds\nin the de Donder gauge is not straightforward.\n{ 3 {\nJHEP04(2017)104\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section 2 , we summarize the one-to-one corre-\nspondence between the discrete supersymmetric vacua of the mABJM theory and the LLM\nsolutions with Zk orbifold. In section 3 , we discuss CPOs in the ABJM theory and obtain\nthe vevs of the operators in the case \u0001 = 1. In section 4 , we apply the KK reduction\nto 11-dimensional supergravity equations of motion and obtain linearized equations for\n4-dimensional gauge invariant KK modes. In section 5 , we use the method of holographic\nrenormalization to read the vevs of CPO with \u0001 = 1 from the asymptotic expansion of\nthe LLM solutions and compare the \feld theory and the gravity results. In section 6 ,\nwe draw some conclusions and discuss some future directions as well. We also include\nthree appendixes where we discuss some general features of spherical harmonics on S7,\ngive some details about asymptotic expansions of the LLM solutions as well as the proof\nof equation (5.48).\n2 Vacua of the mABJM theory and the LLM geometries\nThe N = 6 ABJM theory with U( N)k \u0002U(N)\u0000k gauge group is a superconformal CS\nmatter theory with CS level k and it describes the low energy dynamics of N coincident\nM2-branes on the C4=Zk orbifold \fxed point [ 19]. One interesting feature of the ABJM\ntheory is that it allows supersymmetry preserving mass deformation [ 17, 18]. That is, the\nresulting mass-deformed theory called the mABJM theory has still N= 6 supersymmetry\nthough the conformal symmetry of the original theory is broken under the deformation.\nThis deformation is achieved by adding some terms to the Lagrangian of the ABJM theory,\nwhich break the global SU(4) symmetry to SU(2) \u0002SU(2) \u0002U(1). Solving the classical\nvacuum equation of the mABJM theory, it was shown that the classical vacuum solutions\nare discrete and represented by the GRVV matrices [18]. Some vacuum solutions for given\nN and kare protected from quantum corrections and have one-to-one correspondence with\nthe LLM geometries with Zk [22, 23 ] quotient in 11-dimensional supergravity. In this\nsection, we brie\ry review the correspondence.\n2.1 Supersymmetric vacua of the mABJM theory\nTo re\rect the global symmetry of the mABJM theory we split the 4-complex scalar \felds\nas follows\nYA = (Za;Wya); (2.1)\nwhere A = 1 ;2;3;4 and a;b = 1 ;2. Then the vacuum equation of the mABJM theory,\nLbos = \u0000Vbos = 0, is written as\nZaZy\nbZb \u0000ZbZy\nbZa = \u0000\u0016k\n2\u0019Za; W yaWbWyb \u0000WybWbWya = \u0016k\n2\u0019Wya;\nWaZbWb \u0000WbZbWa = 0; Z bWbZa \u0000ZaWbZb = 0; (2.2)\nwhere \u0016 is a mass parameter. The general solutions of the matrix equations in ( 2.2) have\nbeen found in the form of the GRVV matrices [ 18]. For given N and k, there are many\n{ 4 {\nJHEP04(2017)104\npossible solutions satisfying the equations in (2.2). A systematic way to classify the vacuum\nsolutions is to represent those as direct sums of two types of irreduciblen\u0002(n+1) matrices,\nM(n)\na (a= 1;2) and their Hermitian conjugates, \u0016M(n)\na . These rectangular matrices are the\nGRVV matrices\nM(n)\n1 =\n0\nBBBBBB@\npn 0pn\u00001 0\n... ...p\n2 0\n1 0\n1\nCCCCCCA\n; M(n)\n2 =\n0\nBBBBBB@\n0 1\n0\np\n2\n... ...\n0 pn\u00001\n0 pn\n1\nCCCCCCA\n; (2.3)\nwhere n= 0;1;\u0001\u0001\u0001 ;N \u00001.

From now on we refer to Nn and N0\nn as occupation numbers [22, 23].\nHere N0 and N0\n0 denote the numbers of empty columns and rows, respectively. Since Za\nand Wya are N \u0002N matrices, the occupation numbers, Nn and N0\nn, should satisfy the\nfollowing two constraints,\nN =\nN\u00001X\nn=0\n\u0014\u0012\nn+ 1\n2\n\u0013\u0000\nNn + N0\nn\n\u0001\u0015\n;\n1X\nn=0\nNn =\n1X\nn=0\nN0\nn: (2.5)\nAt quantum level, only a subset of these classical solutions, which satisfy the conditions,\n0 \u0014Nn \u0014k; 0 \u0014N0\nn \u0014k; (2.6)\nremains to be supersymmetric [ 22].\n2.2 LLM geometries and their droplet picture\nThe LLM solution with SO(2;1) \u0002SO(4) \u0002SO(4) isometry in 11-dimensional supergravity\nis conjectured to be dual to the theory of massive M2-branes [ 20, 21]. Later, the mABJM\n{ 5 {\nJHEP04(2017)104\ntheory with CS level k = 1 is proposed to be the theory of massive M2-branes.

Based on this fact, the LLM geometries are represented\nin terms of an in\fnite strip in the ~ x-direction with regions of Z(~x;0) = \u00001\n2 denoted by\nblack color and regions of Z(~x;0) = 1\n2 denoted by white color. This is called the droplet\nrepresentation. See the \fgure 1 . Since the function Z(~x;0) is \u00001\n2 if ~x <~x1 and it is 1\n2\nif ~x >~x2NB+1, NB being the number of \fnite black regions, we note that the strip also\ncontains an in\fnite black region below ~x1 and an in\fnite white region above ~x2NB+1.\nFor every droplet picture there is a symmetric point such that the length of all \fnite\nsize black regions above this point is the same as the length of all \fnite size white regions\nbelow the point. This point is called the Fermi level ~xF, which is given by\n~xF = ~x1 +\nNBX\ni=1\n(~x2i+1 \u0000~x2i): (2.13)\nThe strip is divided into excitation levels above and below the Fermi level, where each level\nhas length k. The levels are labeled by non-negative integers n= 0;1;2;\u0001\u0001\u0001 starting at the\nFermi level. A given droplet representation is then parametrized by a set of parameters\nfln;l0\nngwith ln corresponding to the length of the black region in the n-th level above the\nFermi level andl0\nn corresponding to the length of the white region in then-th level below the\nFermi level. Since the length of the black or white region in a given level cannot be bigger\nthan k these parameters should satisfy the condition 0 \u0014ln;l0\nn \u0014k, which is the same\nas (2.6). Actually, it have been suggested that there is one-to-one correspondence between\nthe LLM solutions and the vacua of mABJM theory [ 23]. Since, the LLM solutions are\nclassi\fed by fln; l0\nng, while the \feld theory vacua are classi\fed by the occupation numbers\nfNn; N0\nng, the one-to-one correspondence is given by\nfln; l0\nng()fNn; N0\nng: (2.14)\nAn alternative representation of the LLM solutions is given in terms of Young diagrams.\nIn Young diagram representation, the lengths of the white and black regions correspond\nto the lengths of the horizontal and vertical edges of the Young diagram, respectively. See\n\fgure 1 for the parametrization of droplet picture and Young diagram.\n3 Vevs of CPOs in mABJM theory\nFor the Coulomb branch of the N = 4 SYM theory, the adjoint scalar \felds Xi's satisfy\nthe vacuum equation [ Xi; Xj] = 0, which means the matrix representations of the scalar\n\felds describing the vacuum moduli are diagonal. As a result, the U( N) gauge symmetry\nis broken to U(1) N. The vacuum moduli preserve the N = 4 supersymmetry while the\nconformal symmetry is completely broken. The vevs of CPOs are non-renormalizable due\nto high supersymmetry and they can parametrize the Coulomb branch vacua. On the other\nhand, in the type IIB supergravity, some BPS solutions describing D3-branes distributed\nover \fnite region of the transverse space were obtained [40]. These solutions are asymptotic\nto AdS5 \u0002S5. According to the gauge/gravity dictionary, the vevs of CPOs is read from\n{ 7 {\nJHEP04(2017)104\nxF\nx2j\nx2j+1\nx2j+2\nx2j-1\nl0\nl1\nl’1k\nk\nk\nk\nk\nk\nx2j+3\nl’n\nx1\nl’0=0 \nln\nx2N B+1 \nx2-x 1\nx3-x 2\nx2N B-x2N B-1 \nx2N B+1 -x 2N B\n(a) (b)\nFigure 1.

Calculating the vevs of CPOs with lower\nconformal dimensions, the exact dual relations for the Coulomb branch of the N= 4 SYM\ntheory in the large N limit were tested in a systematic way [ 13, 14].\nNow we compare the mABJM theory and the Coulomb branch of the SYM theory.\nThere are some di\u000berences between these two theories. For instance, the mABJM theory\nis constructed by adding some relevant terms to Lagrangian of the ABJM theory and\nhave discrete Higgs vacua with matrix representations composed of numerical elements,\nwhile for the Coulomb branch of the N= 4 SYM theory, the Lagrangian is undeformed,\ninstead it is de\fned by choosing some non-vanishing vacuum moduli, which are composed\nof continuous parameters. However, these two theories are similar in the sense that the\ntheories are away from the UV \fxed point and they preserve the full supersymmetry with\nthe dual geometries asymptotic to AdS times a compact manifold. Based on these facts\nand the known results of the Coulomb branch of the N= 4 SYM theory, one can expect\nthat similar phenomena may happen for the Higgs vacua in the mABJM theory. That\nis, the Higgs vacua of the mABJM theory are parametrized by vevs of CPOs and those\nvevs are read from asymptotic expansions of the LLM geometries using the holographic\nrenormalization procedure.\nIn this section, we construct the CPO with \u0001 = 1, which manifests the global symmetry\nof the mABJM theory. We also calculate the vevs of the oprator for all supersymmetric\nvacua of mABJM theory for general k in the large N limit.\n3.1 CPOs in ABJM theory\nThe gauge invariant CPOs of conformal dimension \u0001 in the ABJM theory are given by\nO(\u0001) = C(\u0001)B1;\u0001\u0001\u0001;Bn\nA1;\u0001\u0001\u0001;An Tr\n\u0000\nYA1Yy\nB1 \u0001\u0001\u0001 YAnYy\nBn\n\u0001\n; (3.1)\n{ 8 {\nJHEP04(2017)104\nwhere A;B \u0001\u0001\u0001 = 1;\u0001\u0001\u0001 ;4 and C(\u0001)B1;\u0001\u0001\u0001;Bn\nA1;\u0001\u0001\u0001;An are symmetric in lower as well as upper indices\nand traceless when tracing over one lower index and one upper index. The CPO in ( 3.1) is\nwritten by manifesting the global SU(4) symmetry of the ABJM theory. On the other hand,\nin the mABJM theory the CPOs have to manifest the SU(2)\u0002SU(2)\u0002U(1) global symmetry.\nIt is well known fact that the coe\u000ecientsC(\u0001)B1;\u0001\u0001\u0001;Bn\nA1;\u0001\u0001\u0001;An are identi\fed with the similar co-\ne\u000ecients CI\ni1\u0001\u0001\u0001i2n, which de\fnes the scalar spherical harmonics on S7 (see appendix A) [4].\nThese coe\u000ecients also satisfy the same orthonormality condition as those of the spheri-\ncal harmonics;\nC(\u00011)B1;\u0001\u0001\u0001;Bn\nA1;\u0001\u0001\u0001;An\n\u0016C(\u00012)A1;\u0001\u0001\u0001;An\nB1;\u0001\u0001\u0001;Bn + (c.c.) = \u000e\u00011\u00012: (3.2)\nTherefore, one can \fx these coe\u000ecients knowing the corresponding coe\u000ecients of the spher-\nical harmonics on S7. In appendix A.3 , we list the \frst few scalar spherical harmonics on\nS7, which are needed to read the coe\u000ecients for CPOs with lower conformal dimensions.\nIn particular, the coe\u000ecients of the CPO with \u0001 = 1 are determined in appendix A.4 and\nthe operator is given by\nO(\u0001=1) = 1\n2\np\n2Tr\n\u0000\nZaZy\na \u0000WyaWa\n\u0001\n: (3.3)\n3.2 vevs of CPO in mABJM theory\nHere we calculate the vevs of CPO with \u0001 = 1 in mABJM theory. As we see in ( 3.1), the\nCPO we are considering is composed of the complex scalar \felds YA's and their complex\nconjugates. For a given supersymmetric vacuum, the scalar \felds near the vacuum are\nexpanded as\nYA = YA\n0 + ^YA; (3.4)\nwhere YA\n0 's (A= 1;2;3;4) denote the vacuum solutions represented by the GRVV matri-\nces [18], and ^YA's are \feld operators. Inserting ( 3.4) into (3.1) of a CPO with conformal\ndimension \u0001, we obtain\nhO(\u0001)im = O(\u0001)(YA\n0 ) +\nX\ni\nh\u000eO(\u0001)\ni i0 + 1\nN \u0000corrections; (3.5)\nwhere h\u0001\u0001\u0001i m and h\u0001\u0001\u0001i 0 denote the vevs of operators in the mABJM theory and the ABJM\ntheory, respectively, and \u000eO(\u0001)\ni is an operator containing at least one ^YA or ^YyA. The 1\nN-\ncorrections in ( 3.5) come from the contributions of multi-trace terms [ 41{43]. Here we\nalso note that quantum corrections of scalar \felds are absent due to the high number of\nsupersymmetry of the mABJM theory. The second term in ( 3.5) is a one point function in\na conformal \feld theory and is vanishing. Therefore, in the large N limit we have\nhO(\u0001)(YA)im = O(\u0001)(YA\n0 ): (3.6)\nFor CPO with \u0001 = 1 the vevs are obtained by plugging the vacuum solutions in ( 2.4)\ninto (3.3). Since Za\n0 is a block diagonal matrix, which containsNn of the rectangular matrix\n{ 9 {\nJHEP04(2017)104\nM(n)\na , while Wya\n0 contains N0\nn of the matrix \u0016M(n)\na , we have\nTr(Za\n0 Zy\na0 \u0000Wya\n0 Wa0) = \u0016k\n2\u0019\n1X\nn=0\n(Nn \u0000N0\nn)Tr(M(n)\na \u0016M(n)\na )\n= \u0016k\n2\u0019\n1X\nn=0\n(Nn \u0000N0\nn)n(n+ 1); (3.7)\nwhere in the last step we have used the rectangular matrices in ( 2.3). Then, we obtain\nhO(\u0001=1)im = \u0016k\n4\np\n2\u0019\n1X\nn=0\n(Nn \u0000N0\nn)n(n+ 1): (3.8)\nThis result is valid for all supersymmetric vacua of mABJM theory with \fnite k in the\nlarge N limit.\n4 KK reduction and gauge invariant modes\nThe KK reduction of 11-dimensional gravity to 4 dimensions involves compacti\fcation of\nthe \felds on S7.3 In this section we apply the KK reduction to the 11-dimensional gravity\non AdS4 \u0002S7 to obtain 4-dimensional equation of motion on AdS 4 background. Such KK\nreduction was carried out in the de Donder gauge in [ 30, 31]. However, the LLM solutions\nof our interest in this paper are in a di\u000berent gauge and can not be analyzed based on\nthe results obtained in the de Donder gauge. Therefore, we carry out the reduction in a\ngeneric gauge and write the equation of motion for gauge invariant dynamical \felds.\n4.1 11-dimensional gravity equations of motion\nThe bosonic part of the 11-dimensional supergravity action is given by\nS = 1\n16\u0019G11\nZ\nd11x\n\u0014p\u0000g\n\u0012\nR \u0000 1\n48FpqrsFpqrs\n\u0013\n+ 1\n2 (4!)2 ~\u000fp1p2p3q1\u0001\u0001\u0001q4r1\u0001\u0001\u0001r4Cp1p2p3Fq1\u0001\u0001\u0001q4Fr1\u0001\u0001\u0001r4\n\u0015\n; (4.1)\nwhere we used the index notation p;q;r; \u0001\u0001\u0001 = 0;\u0001\u0001\u0001 ;10, ~\u000f0123\u0001\u0001\u000110 = \u00001 is the Levi-Civita\nsymbol.

The \u0014tJi represent all the \felds that appear in the quadratic part\n{ 16 {\nJHEP04(2017)104\nof the equations of motion. However, at linear order, which is what we are dealing with in\nthis paper, these \feld rede\fnitions are trivial and the 11- and 4-dimensional \felds are the\nsame.

At leading order in the small mass parameter, the\nlinearized equations of motion discussed in the previous section are su\u000ecient. From the\nasymptotic expansions of the LLM geometries, one can read the solutions of some physical\nmodes in 4-dimensional gravity, which are related to the vevs of gauge invariant operators.\nFor instance, the solutions of the KK mode, which are dual to the CPO with \u0001 = 1, are\ncompletely determined from the leading asymptotic expansion of the LLM geometries.\n5.1 Asymptotic expansion of the LLM geometries\nAs discussed in section 2 , the LLM solutions are completely determined by two functions\nZ(~x;~y) and V(~x;~y) in ( 2.10).

The only scalar\n\felds which can be dual to CPOs with lower conformal dimensions are \t I1, with I1 =\n2;4;\u0001\u0001\u0001 . For a similar reason we also skip the asymptotic expansion of the vector \felds in\nsubsection 4.5.2.\n{ 24 {\nJHEP04(2017)104\nThe asymptotic expansions of the spin two KK modes are needed to obtain the vev\nof the energy-momentum tensor in mABJM theory. Following the same procedure as the\nspin zero modes, from ( 4.60) we obtain the asymptotic expansions of the spin two modes\nH2\n(\u0016\u0017) = O(\u00163\n0); H 4\n(\u0016\u0017) = O(\u00164\n0): (5.45)\nAt \u00160 order, we obtain a result which is consistent with the fact that the mABJM theory\nis a supersymmetric theory and the vev of the energy-momentum tensor is vanishing.\nFurthermore, if we go beyond the linear order, the spin two KK modes are modi\fed by\n\feld rede\fnition (4.50) and the vev of energy-momentum tensor should still be vanishing.\n5.3 Comparison with \feld theory results\nAccording to the holographic renormalization procedure [ 5{12], the vev of a CPO with\nconformal dimension \u0001 is determined by the coe\u000ecient \u001e(\u0001) of z\u0001 in the asymptotic\nexpansion of a dual gauge invariant scalar \felds \b on the gravity side, i.e.\nhO(\u0001)im = N2\np\n\u0015\nN\u001e(\u0001) (5.46)\nwhere N is a numerical number depending on the normalization of the dual scalar \feld in\n11-dimensional supergravity, and \u0015is de\fned as \u0015= N=k in the ABJM theory. In the case\nk= 1, the overall normalization in (5.46) is reduced to N\n3\n2 . The N2=\np\n\u0015-dependence in the\nright-hand side of ( 5.46) is a peculiar behavior of the normalization factor in holographic\ndual relation for the M2-brane theory [ 19, 46, 47].\nIn the pervious subsection, we have shown that only the scalar modes \t I1 have non-\ntrivial asymptotic expansions at linear order in \u00160. At quadratic order or higher, more of\nthe scalar modes as well as the spin two modes have non-trivial asymptotic expansions.\nOn the other hand, holographic renormalization states that the dual operators of these\nextra modes should have vanishing vevs. In order to reconcile these di\u000berences we need\nthe \feld rede\fnition [ 13] of the type ( 4.50) to obtain the correct 4-dimensional \felds. The\n\feld rede\fnition makes the asymptotic expansions of all the \felds trivial except for \t I1.\nWe have obtained the asymptotic expansion of the scalar \feld \t 2 in (5.36) while the vev\nof the dual operator was calculated in the subsection 3.2 . Using the gauge/gravity duality\nrelation in (5.46) and setting k= 1, these two results are related as\nhO(1)im = N2\np\n\u0015\nN (1) = \u000024N2\np\n\u0015\nN\f3\u00160: (5.47)\nIn order to \fx the normalization factor N, we use the identity\n1X\nn=0\nh\nn(n+ 1)(ln \u0000l0\nn)\ni\n= N3=2\n3 \f3; (5.48)\nwhich is proved in appendix C .

Therefore, the vev of the CPO\nwith conformal dimension \u0001 = 1 is given by\nhO(1)im = N\n3\n2 \u00160\n3\np\n2 \u0019\f3: (5.50)\nIn Young-diagram picture, \f3 depends on the shape of a Young-diagram but not on the\nsize of the diagram, which means it is independent of the number of M2-branes. The re-\nsult (5.50) is obtained for all possible supersymmetric vacua with large N in the mABJM\ntheory. The N\n3\n2 -dependence in the right-hand side of ( 5.50) exactly matches the N de-\npendence of the 11-dimensional Newton's constant [ 46], which is \fxed by the Bekenstein-\nHawking entropy formula. As it is expected by the holographic relation, this N\n3\n2 behav-\nior also agrees with the total number of degrees of freedom of the M2-brane theory in\nlarge N limit [47].\nThe extension of the above results to k6= 1 case is not straightforward. We postpone\nsuch extension in most general setup to future work. Instead, here we extend the results\nfor the LLM geometries with rectangular shaped Young-diagram representations. In this\ncase the droplet representation has only one \fnite size black strip i.e. NB = 1. The exact\ndual relation is then given by\nhO(1)im = N\np\nk~N\u00160\n3\np\n2 \u0019 \f3 = N\np\nN ~N\u00160\n3\np\n2 \u0019\np\n\u0015\n\f3; (5.51)\nwhere ~N = A=k with A de\fned in ( 5.2) and we have introduced the 't Hooft coupling\nconstant \u0015= N=k in the ABJM theory. In the large N limit, ~N is reduced to N in (5.51).\n6 Conclusion\nIn this paper, we have calculated the vevs of the CPO with conformal dimension \u0001 = 1\nfrom all discrete supersymmetric vacua of mABJM theory as well as from the dual LLM\nsolutions of 11-dimensional supergravity and found an exact holographic relation between\nthe two results with k = 1 in the large N limit. Due to computational di\u000eculties, we\ntreated the case k 6= 1 only for the LLM geometry with rectangular Young diagram. On\nthe \feld theory side, the vevs of CPOs are protected from quantum corrections due to the\nhigh supersymmetry of the mABJM theory and as a result they are completely determined\nby the supersymmetric vacuum solutions in the largeN limit. The CPOs are given by single\ntraces of products of the complex scalar \felds in the mABJM and their vevs are obtained\nby evaluating those traces at the discrete supersymmetric vacua, which are represented\nby the GRVV matrices. On the gravity side, the gauge invariant 4-dimensional scalar\n\felds which are dual to the CPOs were obtained from the KK reduction of 11-dimensional\nsupergravity. We showed that the gauge invariant \felds obtained from the KK reduction\nof the 11-dimensional LLM solutions satisfy the 4-dimensional equations of motion. The\nequations of motion are satis\fed order by order when we expand in powers of the mass\n{ 26 {\nJHEP04(2017)104\nparameter \u00160. This expansion coincides with the asymptotic expansion in the holographic\ncoordinate z from which we read the vevs of the dual gauge invariant operators. For the\nCPO with \u0001 = 1, the vevs are given by the \frst order terms in the \u00160 expansion of the\ndual gauge invariant scalar \felds. We have also carried out this procedure for the energy-\nmomentum tensor in mABJM theory and its vev is vanishing. This result is expected\nbecause the theory is supersymmetric.\nIt seems that the discrete Higgs vacua of the mABJM theory as well as the corre-\nsponding LLM geometries are parametrized by the vevs of CPOs. In other words, knowing\nthe vevs of enough number of CPOs, one can fully determine the shape of the droplet\npicture of the LLM geometry and hence the discrete Higgs vacua of the mABJM theory.\nFor instance, the shape of the droplet with NB = 1 is \fxed by the value of the vevs of the\nCPO with \u0001 = 1 as follows. As it was discussed in subsection 2.2 the shape of the droplet\nis \fxed by the values of ~ xi with i = 1;\u0001\u0001\u0001 ;2NB + 1. For NB = 1, the values of ~x1;~x2,\nand ~x3 are determined by C1;C2, and C3. For our coordinate choice C1 = 0, C2 = 2 from\nthe identity (5.3) while C3 is determined by the vevs of CPO with \u0001 = 1. Therefore, the\nsupersymmetric vacua corresponding to the droplet with NB = 1 are parametrized by the\nvevs of CPO with \u0001 = 1. This is a meaningful result because, if we can calculate the vevs\nof enough number of CPOs, it is possible to project out the supersymmetric vacua from\nthe full set of classical Higgs vacua in the mABJM theory at a given NB. Those super-\nsymmetric vacua are in one-to-one correspondence with the half-BPS LLM solutions. Our\nquantitative results for the gauge/gravity correspondence contains partition of N di\u000berent\ncases. However, we need to accumulate more analytic evidences for CPOs with \u0001 ( \u00152)\nand k (\u00151) to completely determine the supersymmetric vacua at arbitrary NB.

Here\nwe choose a coordinate system in which the zero of the ~ x-coordinate is at the position of\nthe Fermi level i.e., ~xF = 0 and hence C1 = 0.\n{ 33 {\nJHEP04(2017)104\nWith the above choice of coordinate system, we notice that the \f3 on the right hand\nside of ( 5.48) is equal to C3. However, for convenience we add C1\nN and write it as\n\f3 = \u0000\n\u0012C1\nN \u0000C3\n\u0013\n= \u0000 1\nN3=2\n2NB+1X\ni=1\n(\u00001)i+1 \u0000\nmi \u0000m3\ni\n\u0001\n: (C.3)\nWithout loss of generality, we choose a droplet in which the Fermi level lies in the black\nregion. See \fgure 1 . Then we can write \f3 as\nN3=2\f3 = \u0000\n2jX\ni=1\n(\u00001)i+1 \u0000\nmi \u0000m3\ni\n\u0001\n\u0000\n2NB+1X\ni=2j+1\n(\u00001)i+1 \u0000\nmi \u0000m3\ni\n\u0001\n; (C.4)\nwhere m2j is the position of the \frst boundary just below the Fermi level while m2j+1 is\nthe position of the \frst boundary just above the Fermi level. Since the Fermi level is at\nzero, we can rewrite the above equation as\nN3=2\f3 =\n2jX\ni=1\n(\u00001)i+1 \u0000\njmij\u0000jmij3\u0001\n\u0000\n2NB+1X\ni=2j+1\n(\u00001)i+1 \u0000\njmij\u0000jmij3\u0001\n: (C.5)\nUsing the relation\njmij\u00001X\nn=0\nn(n+ 1) = \u00001\n3\n\u0000\njmij\u0000jmij3\u0001\n; (C.6)\nwe obtain\nN3=2\n3 \f3 =\n2\n4\u0000\n2jX\ni=1\njmij\u00001X\nn=0\n+\n2NB+1X\ni=2j+1\njmij\u00001X\nn=0\n3\n5(\u00001)i+1 n(n+ 1): (C.7)\nNoting that for the \frst double summation, mi's are negative while they are positive for\nthe second double summation, we write\nN3=2\n3 \f3 =\n2\n4\u0000\n2jX\ni=1\n\u0000mi\u00001X\nn=0\n+\n2NB+1X\ni=2j+1\nmi\u00001X\nn=0\n3\n5(\u00001)i+1 n(n+ 1): (C.8)\nNext lets expand the summations over i, which gives\nN3=2\n3 \f3 = \u0000\n2\n4\n\u0000m1\u00001X\nn=0\n\u0000\n\u0000m2\u00001X\nn=0\n+ \u0001\u0001\u0001 +\n\u0000m2j\u00001\u00001X\nn=0\n\u0000\n\u0000m2j\u00001X\nn=0\n3\n5n(n+ 1)\n+\n2\n4\nm2j+1\u00001X\nn=0\n\u0000\nm2j+2\u00001X\nn=0\n+\nm2j+3\u00001X\nn=0\n+ \u0001\u0001\u0001\u0000\nm2NB \u00001X\nn=0\n+\nm2NB+1\u00001X\nn=0\n3\n5n(n+ 1): (C.9)\n{ 34 {\nJHEP04(2017)104\nWe combine the summations in each square brackets pair by pair, leaving the \frst term in\nthe second square bracket unpaired, to obtain\nN3=2\n3 \f3 = \u0000\n2\n4\n\u0000m1\u00001X\nn=\u0000m2\n+\n\u0000m3\u00001X\nn=\u0000m4\n+ \u0001\u0001\u0001 +\n\u0000m2j\u00001\u00001X\nn=\u0000m2j\n3\n5n(n+ 1)\n+\n2\n4\nm2j+1\u00001X\nn=0\n+\nm2j+3\u00001X\nn=m2j+2\n+ \u0001\u0001\u0001 +\nm2NB+1\u00001X\nn=m2NB\n3\n5n(n+ 1): (C.10)\nWe note that the summations in the \frst square bracket cover the white regions below the\nFermi level, while the summations in the second square bracket cover the black regions\nabove the Fermi level. However, we recall that in the k= 1 case, the occupation numbers\nln = 1 for the nth excitation level located in a black region above the Fermi level while\nln = 0 for the nth excitation level located in a white region above the Fermi level. Similarly,\nthe occupation numbers l0\nn = 1 for the nth excitation level located in a white region below\nthe Fermi level while l0\nn = 0 for the nth excitation level located in a black region below the\nFermi level. Therefore, we can write the summations in \frst square bracket as summation\nover the entire region below the Fermi level by introducing l0\nn and also second square\nbracket as summation over the entire region above the Fermi level by introducing ln.
