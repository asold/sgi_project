  "abstract": "The steady-state calculations are performed using IEC guidelines to determine the hot spot temperatures of distribution and power transformers in the worst projected Finnish environment due to long summer periods. Moreover, the effect of increase in winding resistance due to increase in ambient temperatures has been taken into account. The primary objective of the research is to investigate the possible extreme circumstances due to climate change. It is concluded that the power and distribution transformers should be progressively de-rated under such circumstances for their safe operations, which will not only prove cost-effective for utilities but also improve the reliability of the power supply to their valued customers in the challenging future smart grid environment.",
