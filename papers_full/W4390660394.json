INTRODUCTION \nDiabetic retinopathy (DR) is a retinal vasculopathy caused by \ndiabetes, has led to a great number of blindness cases among \nthe working-age population worldwide [1]. Since the damage \nto vision caused by DR is irreversible, early detection and \ntreatment are crucial for preserving  DR patients' eyesight. \nWith the rapid development of CNN, it has been successfully \napplied for the detection and classification of DR [2-4].  \nRecently, Transformer has shown superior performance to \nCNN on natural images [5], and therefore has been introduced \nin the field of medical image [6]. Kumar et al. [7] tested CNN, \nTransformer and MLP on the APTOS dataset, and they found \nthat the DR classification performance of Transformer is  \nbetter than that of CNN. While the cost of acquiring and \nannotating medical images is high, and the dataset is limited. \nThus, the classification performance of ViT may be weaker \nthan that of CNN due to the lack of inductive biases [5]. \nAlthough transfer learning can alleviate this issue, in order to \navoid missing pre-trained weights, the resolution of medical \nimages needs to be adjusted to match the resolution of the pre-\ntrained images (e.g., 224× 224). However, medical images \ntypically have a higher resolution than the resolution of natural \nimages used for pre-training [8-10]. For DR, ophthalmologists \ncan identify lesion features such as hemorrhages, hard \nexudates, microaneurysms, and more in high-definition retinal \nimages, as depicted in Figure 1. However, some lesion  \nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

A schematic diagram of DR lesion features, sourced from  \n[11]. \nfeatures are extremely small within the image, as seen in \nFigure 1, where the microaneurysm lesion feature occupies \njust a few pixels, making it easy to overlook. Further image \ncompression in such instances is likely to result in the loss of \nthese features, which can have an adverse impact on the \nmodel's classification capabilities. Moreover, the information \nloss caused by compressing medical images is not conducive \nto alleviating the problem of limited training data, and it also \nhampers fine-tuning the model on medical image datasets. \nFurthermore, inputting high -resolution medical images into \nViT will lead to a larger sequence length, which significantly \nincreases computational time for the self-attention mechanism. \nIn order to use higher resolu tion images while avoiding a \nsignificant increase in network inference time, a new \nTransformer-based multiple instance model (TMIL) is \nproposed for DR classification in this paper. As illustrated in \nFigure 2, a single retinal image is  treated as a \"bag\" and the \nimage is uniformly divided into non -overlapping image \npatches (instances). Then, ViT -Small is used to extract \nfeatures from each instance, followed by adding positional \nembeddings. The GICB is proposed to aggregate features from \ndifferent instances and obtain global features, which are then \nused to generate the final prediction for the bag. The main \ncontributions of this study are listed as follows: \n⚫ A simple and efficient multiple instance model along \nwith a concise GICB is developed for the high-resolution \nretinal fundus images. \n⚫ The model achieves an average accuracy of 85.6%, an \naverage Area Under Curve (AUC) of 95.6%, an average \nKappa score of 91.5%, and an average sensitivity of 73.7% \nfor the five -level classification of DR on  the APTOS \ndataset. On the Messidor-1 dataset, the model achieves \nan average accuracy of 93.1%, an average AUC of \n97.4%, and an average sensitivity of 86.9% for the \nreferable DR classification. The result outperforms that \ndirectly inputting high-resolution images into ViT, and \nthe accuracy surpasses the state-of-the-art results.  \n⚫ Compared to the original ViT, the proposed model not \nonly achieves better performance but also significantly \nreduces inference time by approximately 62%. \n \n \n \n \n \nFIGURE 2. The architecture of proposed TMIL for DR classification.  The model initially uniformly divides the image into patches (instances) and then \nemploys the weight-shared ViT-Small to extract features for each instance. After fea ture extraction, these features are input into the GICB to \ncomplement global features, and finally, a MLP is utilized to output the classification results.  \n \n...\n nput image\n896 896  \n iT  ma  \n eatures\n  oba  \n nstan e \n omputing \n  o k\n16  8 \n  oba  \n nstan e \n omputing \n  o k\n      r  \n osition \n mbedding\n ayer orm  ttention    \n iT  ma   iT  ma   iT  ma  ...\n eight sharing\n at hes  nstan es \n16          \nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

[12] tested networks such as ViT, ResNet101, \nand Inceptionv3 on IDRiD and EyePACS datasets. They \nfound that ViT outperformed CNN like ResNet101 and \nInceptionv3 i n terms of classification performance. \nMeanwhile, Matsoukas et al.  [13] tested the classification \nperformance of ResNet50 and DeiT-S on APTOS, ISIC, and \nCBIS-DDSM. They found that ViT pre-trained on ImageNet \nperforms comparably to CNN with limited data. However, \nViT outperforms CNN by further pre-training ViT using self-\nsupervised methods based upon ImageNet pre -training. The \nDR grading and lesion detection are generally treated as \nseparate tasks, whic h restricts model performance and \npractical deployment. Sun et al. [14] proposed a lesion-aware \ntransformer (LAT) model that can simultaneously perform \nlesion detection and DR prediction on retinal fundus images. \nIt has been shown to achieve better performance than the state-\nof-the-art methods for DR grading and lesion detection. \nB. TRANSFORMER WITH MULTIPLE INSTANCE \nLEARNING IN MEDICAL IMAGE \nYu et al. [15] proposed a multiple instance model called MIL-\nVT for the classification of DR. The model builds upon ViT-\n ma   and in orporates a designed “    head”, and one of the \nclassification result was obtained from the Class Token of \nViT-Small. Each of the rest token, except for the Class Token, \nwas treated as an instance and input to the MIL head. A bag \nprediction was finally output by the MIL head. Myronenko et \nal. [16] applied the multiple instance learning for the \nclassification of histology whole slide images (WSI). They \nembedded a Transformer block to capture the dependencies \namong instances because the tumor grading may depend on \nspecific patterns in different locations within the WSI. They \nalso introduced an instance -wise loss function based on \ninstance pseudo-labels and achieved state-of-the-art results on \nthe PANDA challenge dataset. Qian et al. [17] presented a \nmodel named Swin -MIL based on the Swin Transformer. \nThey also recognized that the independence among instances \nin MIL restricts the model's p erformance due to the lack of \ninter-instance correlation. Therefore, they introduced the \nTransformer into MIL to capture global dependencies and got \nstate-of-the-art results in weakly supervised segmentation \nmethods on a colon cancer dataset. \nIII. METHODOLOGY \nA. MULTIPLE INSTANCE LEARNING \nMultiple instance learning was first introduced by Dietterich \net al. in 1997 [18] to predict the activity of drug molecules. \nThey took the molecule conformation as an instance and all \nthe conformations of the same molecule as a bag. If any \ninstance in the bag had a class label of 1, the bag was labeled \nas 1. If all instances in a bag had a class label of 0, the bag was \nlabeled as 0. The ultimate goal of multiple instance learning is \nto train a multiple instance model that can classify bags. This \napproach is currently known as the Bag-Space (BS) paradigm \n[19]. In addition to the BS paradigm, there are also the \nInstance-Space (IS) paradigm and the Embedded-Space (ES) \nparadigm [20]. In the IS paradigm, instance predictions are \nobtained first, followed by bag predictions. While, in the ES \nparadigm, all instances are embedded into a low-dimensional \nrepresentation, and bag predictions are generated based on \nthese low-dimensional representations [21]. In this work, the \nES paradigm is used to construct the multiple instance model \nin order to leverage the global information of bags as much as \npossible. \nB. VISION TRANSFORMER \nThe ViT is a type of Transformer model applied in the field of \ncomputer vision. Dosovitskiy et al. [5] modified the original \nTransformer architecture by removing the decoder and fine -\ntuning the model details to make it suitable for natural images. \nThey named this model as ViT and achieved state -of-the-art \nclassification results on the ImageNet dataset, which \noutperforms CNN-based approaches. \nThe present Transformer model is based on ViT-Small [5], \nand the architecture of ViT -Small is illustrated in Figure 3. \nThe original structure of this model consists of 12 Transformer \nblocks with an embedding vector dimension of 384. The patch \nsize is 16× 16×3, and the input image size is 224× 224× 3. The \nmodel divides the input image into non -overlapping image \npatches and encodes them into 384-dimensional vectors. After \nencoding, a learnable position embedding vector of the same \ndimension is added to these vectors. Then these vectors are \ninput to the T ransformer blocks for further encoding. Each \nTransformer block consists of 2 LayerNorm layers, 1 multi -\nhead attention module, and an MLP with two fully connected \nlayers. Finally, a simple fully connected layer is used to output \nthe classification results.  \nIn the proposed TMIL approach, the fully connected layer \nused for the final classification in ViT-Small is removed, and \nthe remaining structure is retained for extracting instance \nfeatures. \nC. GLOBAL INSTANCE COMPUTING BLOCK \nThe instances are obtained throug h segmentation on the \noriginal image, which may result in instances with mild lesion \nfeatures or without any lesions being present in the bag with \nsevere lesion. In order to avoid the influence of specific \ninstances and utilize the global information of instances within \na bag, a relatively simple GICB is designed here to perform \ncomputations on the features extracted from different \ninstances. As shown in Figure 2, this module consists of a \nLayerNorm layer, a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and \na single -layer fully connected layer. The multi -head self -\nattention mechanism is used to compute the information \namong features extracted from different instances. \nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

The architecture of ViT-Small. \n \nAnd the global information is introduced accordingly. \nSubsequently, a non -linear transformation is introduced \nthrough the fully connected layer. The multi -head self -\nattention mechanism can be calculated by: \nAttention(𝑄, 𝐾, 𝑉) = softmax (𝑄𝐾𝑇\n√𝑑𝑘\n) 𝑉 (1) \nMultiHead(𝑄, 𝐾, 𝑉) =\n𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑐𝑎𝑡(head1, head2, … , headh)𝑊𝑂 (2) \nEquation (1) represents a standard “  a ed  ot -Product \n ttention”, where Q, K and V are Query Key and Value, \nrespectively. These three components are derived from the \noutput of the previous layer, hence referred to as self-attention. \nIn (2), h represents the number of heads in the multi -head \nattention mechanism. In the ViT -Small model used in this \nstudy, the value of h is set to be 6. The value of a single head \nis obtained by (1). Once the calculations for the 6 heads are \ncompleted, the results from each head are concatenated and \nmapped to the vector dimension set by the model using the WO \nmapping. \nD. MODEL ARCHITECTURE \nFirstly, the original image is divided into 16 non-overlapping \nimage patches. Then, ViT -Small is used to extract features \nfrom these 16 patches individually. After the extraction, the \n“  assifi ation token” from ea h of these 16 features are \nconcatenated t ogether to form a new feature 𝑋𝐹𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑠 ∈\nℝ16×384 . Next, a learnable position embedding 𝐸𝑝𝑜𝑠 ∈\nℝ16×384 is added to this feature as the input to the GICB, as \nshown in (3). The classification results can be obtained by \n...\n nput image\n         \n at hes\n196 16 16  \n inear  ro e tion of   attened  at hes\n196... 195 1 \nTransformer   o k\nTransformer   o k\n... epth 1 \n orm\n orm\n u ti  ead\n ttention\n   \n     ass\n at h    osition  mbedding\ndi ision\nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS \nA. DATASETS AND EXPERIMENTAL SETUP \nIn this study, the APTOS [22] and Messidor-1 [23] datasets \nwere used to test the proposed model. The APTOS consists of \n5,590 color fundus retinal images. However, only 3,662 \nimages have corresponding DR lesion grades, and were \ndivided into five classes. Thus, only these labeled 3,662 color \nfundus retinal images in APTOS were used for training and \ntesting the model in order to implement five -class \nclassification of DR. The Messidor -1 contains 1,200 color \nfundus retinal images, which were specified as four classes [24, \n25]. Due to the limited number of images in the Messidor -1 \nand the insufficient samples of certain class, the samples with \nannotations of grade 0 and 1 were taken as normal samples, \nwhile grade 2 and grade 3 were considered as referable DR. \nThat is binary classification was performed on Messidor-1. \nIn the APTOS, 10% of the fundus retinal images were \nrandomly selected as the test set. 80% of the remaining images \nwere randomly chosen as the training set, and 20% were used \nas the validation set. All images were cropped to remove black \nregions and uniformly resized to 896× 896 pixels. Image \naugmentation included random horizontal flips and random \nrotations within the range of -180 degrees to +180 degrees. \nThe optimizer was AdamW with a weight decay of 0.3. The \nmaximum learning rate was set to 1× 10-4, with a learning rate \nwarm-up for the first 10 epochs. The learning rate was reduced \nby a factor of 0.5 at epochs 20, 35, and 60. The maximum \nnumber of epochs was set to be 110. The loss function was the \ncross-entropy loss with label smoothing of 0.05 [26]. For the \nMessidor-1, the data set partitioning and hyperparameter \nsetting were similar to that with the APTOS. The binary cross-\nentropy loss function was used for DR prediction, and the \nmaximum learning rate was set to be 1× 10-5. \nAll experiments in this s tudy were conducted on an \nNVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU with 24GB of VRAM. The model \nwith the highest accuracy on the validation set was saved \nduring training and tested on the test set. The main evaluation \nmetrics include accuracy, AUC, Kappa score and sensitivity. \nTo avoid the randomness during model training, all \nexperiments were repeated five times and the results were \naveraged. Additionally, all models were set to evaluation \nmode with autograd computation disabled and the batch size \nwas uniformly set to be 16 in comparing the inference time of \nthe models. \nB. ABLATION EXPERIMENT \nThe experimental results on APTOS dataset are presented in \nTable 1. If the images are firstly compressed to 224× 224 and \nthen inputted into ViT, the ACC, AUC, Kappa and sensitivity \nof ViT  (224) are 83.5%, 94.6%, 88.5% and 67.3%, \nrespectively. When the high-resolution images were directly \ninput into ViT for classification, the ACC, AUC, Kappa and \nsensitivity of ViT (896) are 83.9%, 94.6%, 90.3% and 68.3%, \nrespectively. All the performance evaluation metrics of ViT  \n(869) has been improved compared that of ViT  (224). The \nhigh-resolution images with more information are conducive \nto mitigate overfitting, which takes a positive impact on the \nmode ’s performan e.  owe er,  9   position embedding \nweights were missing in directly inputting the 896× 896 \nimages into the pre-trained ViT because the sequence lengths \nof 896× 896 and 224× 224 images are respectively 3136 and \n196. Although missing weights can be obtained through \ninterpolation, when there are too many missing weights, the \ninterpolated weights may have a negative impa ct on the \nmodel's classification performance.

COMPARISON TO STATE-OF-THE-ART METHODS \nThe DR classification result of TMILv4 on APTOS dataset \nwas compared with that by state-of-the-art methods. Vives-\nBoix et al. [27] assessed the capability of CNN models for DR \nclassification on APTOS dataset. They showed that ResNet50 \nachieves an accuracy of 71.4% and sensitivity of 62.3%, while \nVGG-16 demonstrates an accuracy of 72.7% and sensitivity \nof 65.9%. And they improved ResNet50 and VGG16, and \nproposed AmResNet50 and AmVGG16 by enhancing the \nweight updating mechanism during the backpropagation \nprocess of CNN. The accuracy and sensitivity of AmResNet50 \nare 72.7% and 65.4%, while the accuracy and sensitivity of \nAmVGG16 are 78.6% and 72%, respectively. Although the \nsensitivity of AmVGG16 is close to tha t of TMIL, the \naccuracy of AmVGG16 is still much lower than that of TMIL. \nMao et al. [28] modified the decoder structure of MAE and \nintroduced a contrastive learning task to propose S DMAE. \nThey achieved an accuracy of 83.1% on the APTOS dataset. \nYue et al. [29] introduced ADCNet, which utilizes attention \nmechanisms to capture a significant amount of lesion \nperception information. They subsequently employ an \nattention-driven aggregation strategy to acquire a large \nnumber of DR -related features. Their ADCNet  achieved an \naccuracy of 83.4%, an AUC of 94.26%, a Kappa score of \n74.8%, and a sensitivity of 67.7% on the APTOS dataset, with \noverall classification performance slightly lower than TMILv4. \nThe Texture Attention Network proposed by Alahmadi [30] \nachieves an accuracy of 85.1% and a Kappa score of 88.1% \non the APTOS dataset. Feng et al.  [31] proposed a graph \nneural network-based model and achieved an accuracy of 85.5% \nand a Kappa score of 90.6% on the APTOS dataset. While the \nproposed TMILv4 method achieves an accuracy of 85.6% and \na Kappa score of 90.7%. And also, the accur acy of the \nproposed method surpasses that of the MIL -VT method \nproposed by Yu et al. [15]. It should be noted that MIL-VT, in \naddition to utilizing ImageNet pre -trained weights, also \nundergoes pre-training on over 340,000 retinal images. While, \nonly the ImageNet pre -trained weights were required for \nTMILv4. The higher Kappa score of the MIL-VT method may \nbe attributed to the fact that the weights pre-trained on a large-\nscale dataset of retinal images are better than that pre-trained \non natural images. \nTABLE 5.

[14] did not report the \naccuracy of LAT on the Messidor-1 dataset. Although a higher \nAUC of LAT was reported, the DR classification needs to be \nused in conjunction of lesion detection. In  comparison, the \nproposed TMIL focuses on DR classification and has a \nrelatively simple structure. \nTABLE 6.

And the \ninference time on different datasets are shown in Table 7. It \ndemonstrates that the proposed TMIL achieves higher \nclassification performance on high-resolution retinal images \nwhile reduces inference time by 62%. This indicates that the \nproposed TMIL has significant advantages over the original \nViT in fast patient screening. \n \nFIGURE 4. Schematic of ViT self-attention computation, where each \nvector is computed with every vector. This diagram omits steps such as \nvector mapping and MLP. \n \nThe faster inference time achieved by TMIL is attributed to \nthe reduced sequence length resulting from the multiple \ninstance learning approach. \nMore specifically, in (1), Q, K, and V are all matrices with \ndimensions 𝑛 × 𝑑. Here, n represents the sequence length, and \nd denotes the vector dimension (in the ViT-Small model used \nin this study, d corresponds to 384). Formula 1 r equires \ncomputations between an 𝑛 × 𝑑 matrix and a 𝑑 × 𝑛 matrix to \nobtain an 𝑛 × 𝑛 matrix, which is subsequently operated on \nwith an 𝑛 × 𝑑 matrix. This results in a time complexity of \n𝑂(𝑛2𝑑) , where the computational complexity is squared \nrelative to the sequence length. \nIn this study, with input images of size 896× 896, as \nillustrated in Figure 4, directly inputting into ViT produces a \nsequence length of 3136. The Transformer must perform \ncomputations on 3136 vectors. \n \nFIGURE 5. Schematic of TMIL self-attention computation, where the \nimage is divided into 16 instances and the Transformer computes only \nwithin each instance. This diagram omits steps such as vector mapping \nand MLP. \n \nIn TMIL, as shown in Figure 5, an 896× 896 image is \ndivided into 16 instances, each of size 224× 224. The \nTransformer only needs to process individual instances, with \na significantly reduced sequence length of only 196 for each \ninstance. \nAs a result, the reduced sequence length of 196, compared \nto the original 3136 sequence  length, leads to a substantial \nreduction in inference time. \nV. CONCLUSION \nIn this work, a Transformer-based multiple instance model is \ndeveloped for diabetic retinopathy classification on high -\nresolution fundus retinal images. The proposed TMIL adopts \nthe co ncept of multiple instance learning, where the high-\nresolution images are divided into several instances and ViT \nis employed to extract features within each instance. Then a \nGlobal Instance Computation Block (GICB) is designed to \ncompute features from diff erent instances and obtain global \ninformation by using attention mechanisms. Testing on the \npublicly available APTOS and Messidor -1 datasets \ndemonstrates that the proposed TMIL model significantly \nreduces inference time and enhances disease classification \naccuracy compared to the original ViT. This suggests that the \nproposed multiple instance approach can be directly applied \non high -resolution medical images and avoids the loss of \nlesion details caused by image overcompression.

However, it should be pointed out \nthat there still exists a false -negative rate exceeding 30% of \nTMIL, although the sensitivity of TMIL for DR levels 1 and 4 \nis enhanced. The image augmentation can be employed to \nenhance lesion features and thereby enhance the sensitivity in \ndetecting DR levels 1 and 4  in the future .
