  "abstract": "This paper deals with the detection and classification of two types of lamination faults (i.e., edge burr and lamination insulation faults) in a three-phase transformer core. Previous experimental results are exploited, which are obtained by employing a 15 kVA transformer under healthy and faulty conditions. Different test conditions were considered such as the flux density, number of the affected laminations, and fault location. Indeed, the current signals were used where four features (Average, Fundamental, Total Harmonic Distortion (THD), and Standard Deviation (STD)) were extracted. Elaborating A total of 328 samples, these features are utilized as input vectors to train and test classification models based on SVM, KNN, and DT algorithms. Based on the selected features, the results confirmed that the transformer current can be used for the detection of lamination faults. An accuracy rate of more than 84% was obtained using three different classifiers. Such findings provided a promising step toward fault detection and classification in electrical transformers, helping to prevent the system and avoid other related issues such as the increase in power loss and temperature.",
