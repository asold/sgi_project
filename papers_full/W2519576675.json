There are\nmany world remote areas and sites consisting of a single individual, a whole classroom, or a\ncorporate training center.

Introduction\nA young professional engineer who has been in the work place for two years and has a\nbachelor degree now finds that he needs a master’s degree for career advancement. He\ndoesn’t want to leave his employment to enroll in a two-year master’s program and his work\nschedule includes evening and weekend hours, making it difficult to work full time and\nparticipate in a traditional degree program. Distance learning allows him to complete a\ndegree program, whether from a local university or an institution anywhere in the world.\nFor earlier generations, typical audiences of distance education were adults often seeking\nadvanced education and training at home, or on the job, or people whose physical\ncircumstances prevented attendance at a traditional institution. Now, anyone of us is\npotentially a distance learner. The concept is the same as earlier on, but the idea is\nsuccessfully spreading to reach further than handicapped people. The increase of interest is\nrelated to a student population that is increasing in age and has increasing off-campus\ndemands on students’ schedule. The main reasons for this success today are probably the\nrapid development of the multimedia, with mainly, the Internet, and the need for such a\npractical, cost-effective, convenient, and “fast” method of education. In order to create a\nsuccessful remote education solution, universities need to consider the needs of students such\nas interactivity, instructional feedback, elimination of time constraints, and motivation.\nII.   Course delivery using multimedia\nMultimedia application can enhance students’ learning. Active learning indicates what\npercentage we remember: 1) 10% of what we read, 2) 20% of what we hear, 3) 30% of what\nwe see, 4) 50% of what we hear and see, 4) 70% of what we say and 5) 90% of what we both\nsay and do \n1.\nPage 4.217.1\nThe application of multimedia in a live classroom setup expedites the course delivery which\nallows time to interact with students and opportunity to hear what they say, question-answer\nsessions and also for them to see what is said in class 2. Ferguson used multimedia resources\nthrough example problems pointing the demonstration of complex engineering concepts and\nmathematical equations. He uses sine and cosine series by computer graphical presentation\ndepicting complex vibro acoustic measurements and plate theory. He uses multimedia\nenvironment which allowed the whole class, including those involved in distance learning to\nobserve how interactive environment enhance learning \n3. This may fit in that 50% of what we\nhear and see concept of active learning. We need to enhance the process to 90% of what we\nboth say and do.\n2.1.   The Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW)\nEducational uses of the Internet are burgeoning. At any time, learners may access to the site\nand download or use online the electronically stored information. Advantages of delivering\ndistance learning on the Internet include the following: time and place flexibility, number of\npeople reached and potential to reach a global audience, ease of use and of updating of\ncontent, expanding range of applications, extensive information resources, and lower\ndevelopment and operating costs. Some disadvantages are limited bandwidth and slow\nmodems that hamper delivery of sound, video and graphics \n4. However, these limitations will\ncertainly vanish with improving technologies.\nDistance learning on the Internet usually takes one of the following forms: electronic mail\n(for delivery of course materials, sending in assignments, getting/giving feedback, using a\ncourse listserv, i.e., electronic discussion group), bulletin boards/newsgroups (for discussion\nof special topics), downloading of course materials or tutorials, interactive tutorials on the\nweb, real-time interactive conferencing (using Multiuser Object Oriented (MOO) systems or\nInternet Relay Chat (IRC)), “intranets” (corporate websites protected from outside access), or\ninformatics (use of online databases, gopher, websites, and library catalogs) \n4.\nEmails could be used to send graphic and textual information to learners, receive information\nfrom learners, and communicate with a personal tutor. Email, voice mail and faxmail are\nsimple tools that may not be sufficient if used alone, but they may be very effective in\nproviding materials and communicating with learners if combined to other more advanced\ntools.\n2.2.   Teleconferencing and desktop videoconferencing\nTeleconferencing and desktop videoconferencing may not be the most popular forms of\ndistance learning yet, but they are becoming increasingly common. Broadcasts are the most\ncommon forms of teleconferencing today, but software and hardware have made desktop\nvideoconferencing possible and increasingly more affordable and user-friendly. As more\nsoftware becomes available to assist educators/trainers and learners in conferencing \"face-to-\nface\" via computers and telephonic technology, this option should become more popular.\nFurthermore, it creates a sense of community and allows more personal interaction among\nparticipants \n5. A videoconference or teleconference can be used by individuals or groups of\nlearners for a discussion or forum and enables them to see the presentation of educational or\nPage 4.217.2\ntraining materials in real time. A session can bring groups together to share materials\ngathered earlier in the course or to discuss projects they may have completed individually.\nTeleconferencing refers to either long-distance courses in which the educator/trainer presents\ninformation that is uplinked and downlinked, sometimes via satellite, among remote\nlocations, or short-distance courses in which information is presented in a closed \"local\"\nsystem. The technology allows real time interaction, which may be especially effective for\nsome types of instruction (e.g., demonstrations, workshops, discussions) or subject matter \n5.\nIn addition, teleconferences can be video- or audiotaped for later reference or use. People\nwho miss out on a teleconference or who want to review a class session may borrow or buy\ntapes. Teleconferencing has some limitations to effective viewing and communication as for\nthe number of sites with the available technology or the number of participants that one or a\nfew educators/trainers can work with effectively at one time. But despite those limitations,\none educator/trainer still can serve more learners, in widely separated geographic areas via\nteleconferencing, and create a \"real\" classroom by \"virtually\" being in several places at\nonce \n5. The author provides a suitable example as he deals with teleconferencing. He\ncombines both the \"real\" and the \"virtual\" classroom, and all learners attending the lecture\n\"virtually\" or \"really\" can interact with him.\nDesktop videoconferencing, also known as online classes or electronic seminars, is\nsolidifying as a technology. It encourages exchanges and interactions among individuals as\nwell as with the instructor. Students from diverse backgrounds formed groups and personal\nrelationships interacting altogether. Thus, greater arrays of opinion are encountered in such\ndiversified groups than in a typical classroom. In desktop videoconferencing, the course\nsession is conducted online through personal computers installed at participants'  homes or\noffices. Through a video window on their computer screen, they may share online documents\nor even send email messages to each other, unlike in a teleconference. The distinctions\namong participants by race, age, disability, and sometimes gender were imperceptible, or if\nknown, were more easily forgotten in the computer conferencing medium. The students who\nprimarily took distance courses remarked how this new medium suddenly increased the\nperspectives and relationships they could have during their studies, but unfortunately, online\nrelations were not meant to last, but to fulfill important needs of the moment. Desktop\nvideoconferencing shares several key features as asynchrocity (the ability to be involved in\nthe same online conversations at different times), structured communications, multiple sites,\ninteractivity, text-based environment, group involvement \n5.\nThe convenience of videoconferencing from a home or office computer and its affordable\ncost usually make up for the low-end technology in the video or audio quality but this\nimperfection shall not be a source of worry for a long time as we know that technology is\nrapidly evolving. Learners don' t have to travel to a predetermined site to participate in the\nteleconference but may use desktop videoconferencing from their home or office. Since\nvideoconferencing does not require reserving a room equipped for broadcasts,\nvideoconferences may be scheduled more quickly \n5.\nVarious configurations of communication technology are available and they are used in the\napplications described as follows 6:\nPage 4.217.3\nSynchronous mode:\n1 way audio Radio program\n2 way audio Telephone conferences, radio talk show\n1 way audio / 1 way video Television program and video tape distribution\nAsynchronous or Virtual Classroom:\n2 way audio / 1 way video Distance learning transmitted over a high quality analog\nsatellite to multiple sites over a vast area\n2 way audio / 2 way video Video conferencing with compressed digital over telephone\nlines.\nIII.   Active learning\nThe need for students’ active participation as opposed to their passive attendance is the basis\nfor the cooperative learning. In an analysis of 120 studies of cooperative, competitive, it was\nfound that cooperative learning promoted greater individual achievement 1. Todd lectured on\nnew material in every of his class, but all of the in-class problem solving were performed by\nthe students. The students were assigned to teams of three, and much of their cooperative\nexperience was to take place outside the class as they worked on assigned problems together.\nThis process will work if team members are self-disciplined and when they solve the problem\nin the class, they should be able to create interaction with students and be able to demonstrate\nall issues related to the assigned problem. The instructor must also participate in the process\nto improve the class understanding of the problem and he/she must dramatize key points in\nthe problem to stimulate student interest.\nTodd plan was to answer questions related to homework and lecture on the new material. He\nthen formed teams of three or four students in the classroom and assigned a problem for the\nstudents to work on until the end of the class period \n1. This method is interesting as long as\nboth instructor and the graduate assistant are working and observing team members’ progress\nand answering any questions they may have. This arrangement may not work in distance\nlearning environment. However, if such arrangements are through the interactive\nIntercampus or outside campus system, then the instructor can see and hear all of the students\nat both sites all of the time on television monitors. Students can interact with the instructor,\nask any question and receive immediate response. Many campuses are operating this way and\nconstantly improving their existing system. Future technology of such system can be\nenhanced and instructors can allot time in their office hours through their office PC hear, see,\nand interact with off-campus and on-campus students on their office PC monitors, see\nstudents receive their questions and respond back wherever students’ destination are. This\narrangement may even provide opportunity for those on-campus students who can not attend\nthe class for some reason or other and they still can participate and receive class lectures at\ntheir destination through their personal PC connected to the system. Todd in his combined\ncooperative and distance learning through intercampus telecommunication found the\nmethods very useful and he believes the process require additional innovation for a better\nsuccessful outcome \n7.\nPage 4.217.4\nThe distance learning through personal computer is also important for busy executives who\nneed to be educated in order to meet the ever changing global market competition. Every\nyear, more adults are pursuing formal education programs in spite of full-time employment,\nmarriage, childrearing, and community activity. Some seek degrees, having only limited\naccess to institutional resources because of remoteness or schedule conflicts 8.\nParticularly with significant changes occurring in the economy, many industry executives\nneed personal development to be educated in advance, since business practices are at an ever\nincreasing rate. United States must compete in the global market, then emphasize on\ncorporate excellence, continuous learning and worker development, essential through\ndistance learning deliverable by high tech communication \n2.\nThe author developed 226 pages of class notes for his construction method and management\nundergraduate senior civil engineering students. The material is HTML-based Internet\napplications easily accessible by his students. The material is constantly updated and\ninstantly distributed over the Internet. The HTML-based Internet is very efficient and\nincreases the productivity and effectiveness of the multimedia educational material. His\nclassroom setup is such that he connects to Internet immediately upon his arrival to the class\nand the material are projected on large screen which enables him to retain the attention-span\nof students and use his time effectively for the question and answers sessions. He opens the\ndialog with his students on class issues to serve and to stimulate student interest, improve\nstudent understanding of course material, and he dramatizes the key points \n2.\nIV.   Distance learning challenging the traditional learning system\nUniversities are faced with a number of major challenges if they will continue to follow the\ntraditional approach in delivering education. They will incur the cost of building new\nphysical infrastructures, such as campuses, dormitories, and libraries and maintaining the\nexisting ones. Another key challenge is the increasing cost of education, as tuition is\nconstantly on the rise. A third problem is the declining interest of some segments of the\ngraduating high school population in obtaining a college education. Hence, universities are\nforced to compete in order to attract graduating high school students. A fourth problem is the\nincreasing budgetary constraints facing the government at the federal and state levels \n9.\nUniversities cannot hope to maximize the benefits of automation without attacking those\nproblems through specific distance learning applications.\nBy implementing distance learning solutions, a greater number of remote classes can be\ncreated, giving education providers the opportunity to generate more revenues per teacher or\nto reduce the tuition per student. Moreover, a university can differentiate itself from other\nuniversities by being at the leading edge of technology.\nFlorida Engineering Educational Delivery System (FEEDS) is an excellent example of\noffering off-campus engineering courses throughout Florida to full-time engineers working\nwith public, industry and private consulting companies. FEEDS was developed in response to\nthe needs of engineering graduates working in industry for access to quality programs and\nPage 4.217.5\nextended studies in engineering 10. FEEDS courses are offered by many Florida universities\nincluding University of Florida (UF) and University of Central Florida (UCF). In these\ninstitutions, FEEDS courses are held in special studio classrooms equipped with televisions,\nELMO (an electronic projector for pictures, newspaper slips, any written material, etc…),\nelectronically connected slide projectors and computer facilities projecting any software\ngenerating results including power point presentations, etc… The setup is such that live\naudience (students) in classroom and other students at remote sites receive the lecture\nthrough FEEDS and through live television transmission. Students receiving lectures through\nlive television transmission are able to see the class, the instructor and they interact with both\ngroup by asking questions and answers. The remaining students receive videotaped classes\nby express-mailing. Colorado State University offers videotape-based engineering degree\nprogram \n7.\nThe course syllabus, handouts, and all course material are regularly delivered through\nFEEDS to off-campus students. Same textbooks are used, and it is the responsibility of off-\ncampus students to contact university bookstores and order a text copy. The educational\nstandard, course content, homework, assignments, and tests are kept the same and\ninstructors’ expectations from off-campus students are the same as on-campus students.\nThe Internet is becoming an attractive tool to many on-campus instructors. For example,\ninstructors incorporate their prepared lecture notes in to the Internet for students to obtain\naccess under the designated course. The instructor can also provide the copy of a course class\nnotes in the college bookstore or through student chapter organizations for a minimum\npurchase price. The instructor can also deliver his class notes through e-mail to students or\nthrough Internet for students to access the class notes. The author uses all methods above and\ndelivers all his graduate and undergraduate classes through FEEDS and Internet. He also\ncommunicates with his students through e-mail for homework, questions, his teaching\nperformance, questions on students learning, etc…\nChristensen and Barnett at UCF developed an Internet home page for students access to:\nSyllabus, frequently asked questions, grading policies, assignments, handouts, lecture notes,\npractice exams, helpful hints, list of links to WWW resources pertinent to the course guides\nand course student teacher evaluation. They also compared final grade of off-campus to on-\ncampus students and grades were almost the same; an indication of an equal amount of\nlearning. The UCF authors believe that FEEDS can be offered cheaper through Internet \n7.\nMeanwhile, the spectacular growth of the distance learning market is likely to be slowed by a\nnumber of teacher-related factors. The first is “technophobia”, or teacher’s fear of dealing\nwith new technologies. The second is computer illiteracy in a portion of the teacher\npopulation. The third is teacher’s reluctance to switch from traditional methods of teaching to\ntechnology-oriented approaches, a switch that sometimes requires a significant amount of\neffort. Furthermore, teachers’ unions, eager to protect the interests of their members, fear that\nsuch growth would result in the reduction of teaching jobs \n9.\nPage 4.217.6\nV.   Conclusion\nCourse delivery using effective tools such as multimedia and electronic communication will\nenhance students’ learning on-campus and off-campus. The HTML-based Internet\napplications are effective tools that can be used to both on-campus and off-campus students.\nThe Internet and the World Wide Web are burgeoning. Advantages of such system are many\nand to mention a few will include mainly time savings and place flexibility. Putting the\nmaterial on CD’s and videotapes to be delivered to remote areas are also effective tools.\nEducation can be delivered long distance to remote areas, homes, corporate offices, and\nspecifically to a global audience. Teleconferencing and desktop videoconferencing as an aid\nfor online classes or electronic seminars are also solidifying as a technology. Those two\nmethods of educational delivery do not require traveling to a central location, but many\nwould rather stay at their homes or offices. Interactions among students and instructors can\nbe accomplished among diverse groups exchanging points and counter-points. These\nmethods offer to participants active learning which enables them to retain 90% of what they\nlearned. Teaching/learning is a continuous process and one needs to be very creative and\nmust use innovative practices in course design. The computer technology must be enhanced\nto the point that videoconferences are offered more economically to remote areas where a PC\ncan be connected to any classroom setup and individuals could receive and interact\nconstantly with both the instructors and live audiences. Distance learning is seriously\nchallenging the traditional teaching/learning system. It is envisioned that in the next decade\nthere will be a significant expansion in the distance learning education at a global level.\nUniversities are forced to adopt this new system in order to compete and survive. People will\nlearn at their own pace without having to relocate. They will take courses at their homes or\noffices having full interaction with instructors and students.\nBibliography\n1.
