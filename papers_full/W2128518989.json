INTRODUCTION  \n \nDespite many attempts by educators to bring in hands-on \nactivities such as real equipment [1], video analysis [2] or \ncomputer simulation [3] in the learning of projectile motion, \nsome research studies [4-6] continue to document the \nmisconceptions or learning difficulties encountered by \nstudents.   \nWhile the use of real life examples, such as tossing a ball \nto demonstrate projectile motion, is performed by students in \nclass, it is nevertheless challenging for students to understand \nthe mathematical equations involved in projectile motion.  \nOur hypothesis is that by allowing students to test their \nmathematical computer models against video analysis of the \nreal motion of a projectile, students will gain a deeper \nunderstanding of the concepts and overcome the learning \ndifficulties associated with the topic. \nTo test this hypothesis, a relatively new pedagogical \napproach called ‘video modeling’ [7] by Douglas Brown is \nused. The free software tool Tracker [8] used in this ‘video \nmodeling’ can be downloaded from the Open Source Physics \n[9] website and has been used by authors [10] in Physics \nEducation journal as well.  \nII. INSTALLATION OF TRACKER \nTracker is a video analysis and modeling tool built on \nthe Open Source Physics (OSP) Java framework. Though it is \npossible to run from the Web start or a 3.9 Mb \nTracker_461.jar file, we recommend using the respective \ninstallers found at http://www.cabrillo.edu/~dbrown/Tracker/, \nespecially to enable the Xuggle video engine [11] that can \ndecode most video file formats. Installers for Tracker version \n4.62 installers are available in Windows, Mac OS X as well as \nLinux operating systems.  \nIII. VIDEO ANALYSIS OF PROJECTILE MOTION  \nIn an ideal projectile motion, equations (1) and (2) \nrepresent the mathematical equations of velocity and \ndisplacement in the x and y direction respectively. \ntg\ng\nu\nu\nv\nv\ny\nx\ny\nx\ny\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                  \n(1) \n2\n0\n0\n2\n1 tg\ngtu\nu\ny\nx\ny\nx\ny\nx\ny\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                 \n(2) \n \nAfter using Tracker to either manually or automatically \ntrack the projectile’s trajectory, the data tool can be used to \nanalyze motion and allows the determination of the numerical \nvalues of  quantities such as acceleration, gx and gy and initial \nvelocity ux and uy, in the x and y directions respectively. This \ncan be done by comparing the coefficients of the respective \nlinear fit and parabolic fit as in equations (3) and (4) with \nequation (1) and (2) later on. \n \nta\na\nb\nb\nv\nv\ny\nx\ny\nx\ny\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                  \n(3)\n  \n \n2\n2\n1 ta\natb\nb\nc\nc\ny\nx\ny\nx\ny\nx\ny\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n(4) \n \n     2/6 \nThe video on the Tracker installation called \nBallTossOut.mov (Figure 1) is used for subsequent \ndiscussions in this paper. Readers who need step by step help \nin video analysis may refer to this YouTube video [12]. There \nis a slight difference between the current version 4.62 and 3.1 \nbut the YouTube video is still relevant. \n \n \nFigure 1. World view of a projectile motion as in the video \n‘BallTossOut.mov’ shown with 0 fade using the ghost filter. \nAs an example, Figure 2 shows a typical Tracker’s video \nanalysis of a y vs t graph.  After choosing the parabola fit of \nequation (4y), the parameters a,b and c are determined by the \nTracker’s data tool as shown by the “Fit Equation” and \ncompared to coefficients in equation (4y) and subsequently to \nequation (2y).  \n \nFigure 2. Data tool display of mass_A  y versus t view where parabola fit \nequation of y = a2*t +b*t +c  is used with parameters a = –5.038,  b = 2.379 \nand c = –0.003. By comparing with equation (4y), it is determine that gy = –\n10.08 ms–2 and uy = 2.379 ms–1  respectively. \nThus,  \na (parameter in Tracker’s Data Tool) = ay (equation 4y) = \n– 5.038 (value in Tracker’s Data Tool),  \nb = by = – 2.379 and  \nc = cy = – 0.003. \nBy comparing coefficients with the equation (2y), the \nstudents can infer the values of: \nyg2\n1  = – 5.038, thus gy = – 10.08 ms–2,  \nuy = 2.379 ms–1and  \ny0 = – 0.003 m respectively.  \n \nThe value ay = – 10.08 ms–2 can be interpreted to be \napproximately equal in value to the gravitational acceleration \nconstant at the surface of Earth of – 9.81 ms–2 (3 significant \nfigures adopted by Advanced Level General Certificate of \nEducation GCE) and –10 ms–2 (2 significant figures required \nby GCE Ordinary Level ). \nSimilarly, video analysis can be conducted on the x vs t \ngraph (Figure 3) to arrive at the values of:  \nux = 1.733 ms–1 and  \nx0 = – 0.005 m respectively. \n \n \nFigure 3. Data tool display real data mass_A of the x versus t view where a \nline fit equation of x = a*t +b is used with parameter a = 1.733 and b = –\n0.005 as determined using Tracker. By comparing with equation (4x), it is \ndetermine that vx = 1.733 ms–1 . \nA good teaching point that surfaces is the appreciation of a \npossible systematic error from the calibration stick length \npositioning, and random errors from the measurement or \nselection of the analysis points, especially when manually \ntracking the path of the motion. \nThis active inquiry activity typifies the actions of scientists \n[9,13], and is well suited for students to construct their own \nunderstanding of the physics of motion through a real world \nvideo, without referring to the authoritative sources of \nknowledge such as teachers and books. \nOnly after this determination of the variables through \nvideo analysis, can we tap on the pedagogical advantage of \nvideo modeling to allow students to test out their \nunderstanding of projectile motion and also to address their \nmisconceptions in the process of model construction. \nIV. VIDEO MODELING – DYNAMIC PARTICLE MODEL AS A \nPEDAGOGICAL TOOL THAT CAN ADDRESS MISCONCEPTIONS \nNovice students who develop personal “theories of \nmotion” [14] by generalizing the ideas they acquire from \nobservation of objects in everyday situations [4] and non-\nprojectile motion, such as propelled rockets seen in \nentertainment media, can harbor naive “impetus theory” [5] of \nmotion. Thus, we suggest using Tracker’s dynamic particle \ninstead of the other kinetic particle, because the dynamic \n     3/6 \nmodel easily represents gravity and drag forces affecting the \nmotion. This dynamic model when utilizing numerical data \nvalues determined from earlier III video analysis to test their \n“impetus theory” models juxtaposed against a real video of \nprojectile motion, can address some misconceptions as \ndiscussed later in IV.A, IV.B and IV.C. \nAgain, readers may refer to this other YouTube video [15] \nthat shows the process of building a dynamic particle model \non a projectile motion video useful.  \n \nA. Absence of a  x-direction force \nAccording to naive theory of impetus [16], \n \n“When a mover sets a body in motion he implants into it a \ncertain impetus, a certain force enabling a body to move in the \ndirection in which the mover starts in”.  \n \nOur research suggests that some students do think of an \nobject in motion as having external force acting on it, for it to \ncontinue in the x direction. Although this can be verbally \nrationalized with students using Newton’s First Law of \nmotion that since there is constant x velocity, the resultant \nforce in x direction has to be zero. However, without an \nopportunity to refute their incorrect mental model, this “talk” \n[17] alone may not be effective in helping students to advance \ntheir conceptual understanding.  \nUsing Tracker, we guide students to test out their mental \nmodel by proposing a dynamic particle model that has a non-\nzero value in the force in x-direction, fx, inferring from \nequation (3x) and (4x) when ax = 0 ms–2  and mass = 1 kg.  \nWe suggest an activity where students key in values for \nthe initial velocity vx in the dynamic model and observe the \nreal data (red) versus the constant vx model (pink). This allows \nthem to make sense for themselves that instantaneous velocity \nis (in this case) approximately equal to 1.733 ms–1 at all times \nof the projectile motion as in Figure 4.   \n \nFigure 4. World view of a projectile motion with real data (red) versus the \nconstant vx model (pink) on the left and the model builder of vx = 1.733 ms–1  \non the right. Notice the pink model of constant vx = 1.733 ms–1  is a vertically \ndownward projection of the red real motion.  \nSimilarly, by keying in non-zero values for fx ( fx ≠ 0 N) \nwhen mass of projectile m = 1 kg, students can observe paths \nsimilar to Figure 5 for the case of fx = 10 N and compare the \nreal data (red) versus the fx = 10 N model (teal). Students can \nverify that the vertically projected downward ‘shadow’ of the \nreal data does not coincide with the fx = 10 N model (teal) and \nthus, will continue to propose different values until they are \nsatisfied with their own model of fx = 0 N (pink) as in earlier \nFigure 4.  \n \nFigure 5.  World view of a projectile motion with real data (red) versus the \nfx =10 N model (teal) on the left and the model builder values of vx = 1.733 \nms–1  and fx = 10 N for this incorrect model on the right. The evidence of the \nincorrect model against the real data compels students to rethink their \nassumptions on non-zero force in x-direction \nB. The  y direction acceleration is constant and has a \nnegative sign \nMany students espouse naive impetus theory such as the \nneed for an upward force in projectile motion, similar to the x-\ndirection as in the case of absence of a x-direction force \nmentioned earlier in A.  \nStudents are guided to key in values for positive values for \nfy and infer that their naïve impetus theory cannot be validated \nwith the real video. \nAs the computer axis adopts the conventional Cartesian \ncoordinate system, this allows students to appreciate the \nnegative sign of gy = – 10.08 ms–2 easily as a positive fy results \nin a parabolic upwards path (Figure 6). \n \n \nFigure 6. World view of a projectile motion with real data (red) versus the \nfy =10 N model (green) on the left and the model builder values of vx = 1.733 \nms–1  and fy = 10 N for this incorrect model on the right. The evidence of the \nincorrect model against the real data compels students to rethink their \nassumptions on positive force in y-direction.  \nBy incrementally improving the computer model, students \ncan develop deeper understanding of the consequence of \nchanging fy = – 10 N (Figure 7). \n     4/6 \n \nFigure 7. World view of a projectile motion with real data (red) versus the \nfy = – 10.08 N model (yellow) on the left and the model builder values of vx = \n1.733 ms–1  and fy = – 10.08 N for this more suitable model on the right. This \nmodel provides evidence of possibly a correct downward direction of the \nforce.  \nFigure 8 shows how a complete model will look like with \nthe inclusion of initial velocity in y direction, vy = 2.379 ms–1 .  \n \n   \nFigure 8. World view of a projectile motion with real data (red) versus the \ncorrect model of vx = 1.733 ms–1 , vy = 2.379 ms–1  and fy = –10.08 N  (light \nblue) by a data driven modeling process instead of trial and error can deepen \nlearning. \nWe recommend a data driven modeling process to deepen \nlearning, i.e. students use initial values obtained from the \nanalysis process as in III instead of a completely trial and \nerror approach. \nC. Absence of air resistance in low velocity projectile \nmotion \nExpert students can be challenged to extend their own \nlearning to model air resistance by comparing the trajectories \nof the dynamic particle model and that of the real video, and \nbeing convinced that the video’s projectile motion cannot be \nrealistically assumed to be a motion with significant air \nresistance Figure 9. The model for air resistance may be \nexpressed as in equation (5) with fdrag = k*v (assuming a \nsimple linear relationship between drag force and velocity it is \ntraveling at). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ny\nx\ndragy\ndragx\nv\nvkf\nf\n                                \n(5) \n \n \nFigure 9. World view of a projectile motion with real data (red) versus the \nair drag model by Fdrag = k*v by inserting fx = 0–k*vx and fy = –10.08 –k*vy \n(white) where k = 1 on the left with the model builder values on the right. \nOnly when the values of k are very close to zero do the \ntrajectories of the model and the real video juxtapose the \nclosest. This again gives real evidence to conclude that the \ntossing out of a ball in projectile motions at low velocities are \nwell approximated by the theoretical equations (1) and (2).   \nV. STUDENTS’ REFLECTION ON TRACKER LESSON  \nTo give some themes into the conditions and processes \nduring the laboratory lessons, the following are some excerpts \nfrom the qualitative survey results and informal interviews \nwith the students. Words in brackets [ ] are added to improve \nthe readability of the qualitative interviews. \n1) Active learning can be fun \n \n“Very good. Improve our understanding on physics, as we \nare able to see the real life example in a fun and interesting \nway.” \n \n“I liked doing the experiment with those interesting \ninstruments and software.  I learnt a lot in a fun way.” \n \n“I think it is amazing how the comp[uter] knows how to \ndo so many kinematics stuff, its kind of fun doing practical \nusing this.” \n \n2) Tracker can support inquiry learning and thinking like \nreal scientists \n  \n“It prepares us for similar activities we have to do in [the] \nfuture, either in university or our careers in the science \nindustry. It is also interesting to learn how an actual process \n(visual form) of motion-tracking is like, instead of drawing \ngraphs based on a worded situation.” \n \n“Get to learn things by ourselves, not spoon-feed by \nteachers. It is interactive; the visual is much better for learning \nthan all the words in the tutorials.” \n \n“It was refreshing....Through this video Tracker lesson, we \nlearned that there's such a programme for the scientist :)” \n \n“Normally I thought those theories and formulae don’t \nwork perfectly in real life. The programme shows they \nactually work.” \n \n     5/6 \n3) Overcoming initial difficulties using Tracker \n \n“System [Tracker] may be difficult to use at first but once \nyou can get use to it, it is quite convenient and very fast” \nVI. TEACHERS’ REFLECTION ON USING THE DYNAMIC \nPARTICLE MODEL  \n \nWe would like to share two significant reflections by the \nten teachers in the using of this dynamic particle model:  \n1. The mathematical and graphical understanding of the \nmotion in the vertical and horizontal directions improves as \nthe students deduce the kinematics equations and \nmathematical representations during the activity.  \n2. Video modeling pedagogy is suitable for active and \ndeep learning because the students can be said to be predicting \nby keying certain values, observing by comparing the real \ndata with the current proposed model, and explaining [18] \ntheir choice of values and making sense of the video analysis \ndata. Even with incorrect models proposed, the results from \nthe world view and associated multiple representational views \n[19] in various scientific plots can allow the facilitation of \ndata driven social discussions among students and teachers.  \nVII. CONCLUSION  \nThe relative ease of installation and use of Tracker to \nconduct learner-centered in-depth video analysis with \nreference to the theoretical physics model of an ideal \nprojectile motion is discussed in this paper.  The values \ndeduced from video analysis are consistent with real world \ndata of gravitational acceleration on surface of Earth.  \nMore importantly, the video modeling especially when \ndriven with data from video analysis, allow students to \ndiscover using evidences and incomplete models proposed by \nthemselves, to incrementally and iteratively improve and self-\ninvent a better model to predict and explain the projectile \nmotion. This has lead to surprisingly pleasant “Eureka” \nexperiences for our students as they connect abstract concepts \nand formulae with real world examples thus deepening \nlearning.   \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nWe wish to acknowledge the passionate contributions of \nDouglas Brown, Wolfgang Christian, Mario Belloni, Anne \nCox, Francisco Esquembre, Harvey Gould, Bill Junkin, Aaron \nTitus and Jan Tobochnik for their creation of Tracker video \nanalysis and modeling tool.  \nREFERENCE \n1 S.
