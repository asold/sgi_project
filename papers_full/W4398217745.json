  "abstract": "Abstract The recent advent of artificial intelligence (AI) language tools like ChatGPT has opened up new opportunities in qualitative research. We revisited a previous project on obesity prevention interventions, where we developed a causal loop diagram through in‐depth interview data analysis. Utilizing ChatGPT in our replication process, we compared its results against our original approach. We discuss that ChatGPT contributes to improved efficiency and unbiased data processing; however, it also reveals limitations in context understanding. Our findings suggest that AI language tools currently have great potential to serve as an augmentative tool rather than a replacement for the intricate analytical tasks performed by humans. With ongoing advancements, AI technologies may soon offer more substantial support in enhancing qualitative research capabilities, an area that deserves more investigation. © 2024 The Authors.
