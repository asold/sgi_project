  "abstract": "Twitter sentiment detectors (TSDs) provide a better solution to evaluate the quality of service and product than other traditional technologies. The classification accuracy and detection performance of TSDs, which are extremely reliant on the performance of the classification techniques, are used, and the quality of input features is provided. However, the time required is a big problem for the existing machine learning methods, which leads to a challenge for all enterprises that aim to transform their businesses to be processed by automated workflows. Deep learning techniques have been utilized in several real-world applications in different fields such as sentiment analysis. Deep learning approaches use different algorithms to obtain information from raw data such as texts or tweets and represent them in certain types of models. These models are used to infer information about new datasets that have not been modeled yet. We present a new effective method of sentiment analysis using deep learning architectures by combining the “universal language model fine-tuning” (ULMFiT) with support vector machine (SVM) to increase the detection efficiency and accuracy. The method introduces a new deep learning approach for Twitter sentiment analysis to detect the attitudes of people toward certain products based on their comments. The extensive results on three datasets illustrate that our model achieves the state-of-the-art results over all datasets. For example, the accuracy performance is 99.78% when it is applied on the Twitter US Airlines dataset.",
