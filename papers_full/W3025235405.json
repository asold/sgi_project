Eastern chimpanzees. Northern Democratic Republic of\nCongo . Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii\nIntroduction\nHuman behavior is characterized by its remarkable diversity in most observable\ndomains. For instance, clothing, architecture, housing style, language, pet choice and\nfood preference can all differ profoundly between cultures (Murdock 1981; see also\nElectronic Supplementary Material [ESM] 1). Much of this variation is assumed to be\nbased on culture, defined by Whiten et al .( 1999)a s “behavior that is transmitted\nrepeatedly through social or observational learning to become a population-level\ncharacteristic.” Environmental factors obviously also play a part; for instance, an\nisolated desert society with no access to the sea cannot develop a seaweed-based\ncuisine. In addition, some preferences, such as milk-drinking by adults, can be linked\nto genetic differences between populations (lactase persistence; Krebs 2009)a n dt o\nsocioeconomic factors (Scholliers 2001). Nevertheless, it is clear that socially learned\npreferences impact which foods human cultures see as edible and/or desirable, as well\nas the details of their tools, housing, and clothing. This bias toward culturally approved\nsolutions and preferences, or “cultural override, ” has a strong influence on human\nbehavior (Haun et al . 2006) and could represent one of the factors that differentiate\nhuman culture from other animal traditions (i.e., learned behaviors that show continuity\nacross generations; McGrew 2004). This raises the question of whether such a divorce\nbetween resource availability and the development of material traditions to harvest\nthose resources can be recognized in other species, in particular in our close cousins the\nchimpanzees (Pan troglodytes).\nPossible culturally mediated differences in food preferences and other behaviors\nhave been proposed for a number of nonhuman primates, i.e., gorillas ( Gorilla gorilla\nand G. beringei :G a n a s et al . 2004;G a n a sa n dR o b b i n s2004;R o b b i n set al . 2016),\nBornean orangutans ( Pongo pygmaeus wurmbii :J a e g g iet al . 2010), and white-faced\ncapuchins ( Cebus capucinus :P a n g e r et al . 2002). Chimpanzees display the largest\nnumber of putative cultural variants of any nonhuman animal studied (Whiten et al .\n1999), with multiple traditions identified across Africa, including subsistence-oriented\nThe Relationship Between Tool Use and Prey Availability in... 937\nmaterial culture, gestural “dialects” (Luncz and Boesch 2015; Luncz et al. 2015;\nMcGrew and Tutin 1978; Nakamura 2002), and differences in food preferences\n(Nishida et al . 1983), in some cases even between neighboring communities (Boesch\net al . 2006;H o b a i t e ret al . 2017). Migrating female chimpanzees change their nut-\ncracking techniques to match those used by their new community (Luncz et al. 2015).\nA similar result was obtained in captivity, where chimpanzees would replace their own\ntechnique of opening a box to match the variant technique of a group of chimpanzees,\nbut not a single individual (Watson et al. 2018). Experiments with captive chimpanzees\nhave further shown the apes to be capable of transmitting variants of experimentally\nseeded behaviors from one group to another; for reviews, see Whiten ( 2017, 2019).\nThe mechanisms through which cultural variants are spread and maintained in\nnonhuman great apes are hotly debated, with some results favoring attributes formerly\nconsidered uniquely human, such as “conformity” (apes in the minority adapting their\nbehavior to fit into a new norm) (Whiten et al. 2005) and even, in the wild, some forms\nof teaching (Boesch 2012). Other researchers, however, have challenged this proposed\ncontinuity between human and chimpanzee mechanisms of cultural transmission,\narguing that nonhuman great apes lack traits such as conformity (Haun et al . 2014),\nimitation, and cumulative culture (Marshall-Pescini and Whiten 2008b; Tennie et al .\n2009), thus limiting the usefulness of cross-species comparisons [ cf.S a n za n dM o r g a n\n(2007) for a possible example of cumulative culture in the wild, the manufacture of\ntermite brush sticks]. Field experiments have shed some light on these issues. For\ninstance, chimpanzee behavior, like that of humans, appears in some cases to be\nconstrained by cultural override: (Gruber et al . 2009, 2011): i.e., different populations\nrespond differently to environmental cues based on their adherence to local traditions,\nin this case leading to markedly different responses to leafy sticks as potential tool-\nmaking material. It is unclear whether this is maintained by conformity as discussed in\nthe preceding text or some other mechanism, but the similarity to human cultural\npreferences is suggestive. Nevertheless, differentiating the possible influence of cultural\nfrom genetic and ecological factors presents researchers with a formidable challenge\n(Langergraber et al . 2010;M c G r e w1992).\nCompeting Explanations for Chimpanzee Behavioral Diversity\nWhen postulating cultural explanations for behaviors in chimpanzees and even in\nhumans, we must first rule out competing explanations (McGrew 1992, 2004).\nLangergraberet al.( 2010) pointed out the difficulty of disentangling genetic influences\non behavior from cultural ones. In addition, some examples of “cultural variation” can\nbe explained more parsimoniously as being tied to ecological factors (Collins and\nMcGrew 1987; Koops et al. 2013, 2014) or differences in the behavior of invertebrate\nprey (Möbius et al. 2008). Finally, Tennie et al.( 2009) proposed that chimpanzees may\nbe using simpler learning mechanisms for transmitting traditions than those used by\nhumans ( “zone of latent solutions ” hypothesis). An important corollary of the latter\nhypothesis is that ecological conditions may “draw out ” universal chimpanzee capa-\nbilities that are not expressed in other contexts.\nHicks T.C. et al.938\nKoops et al.( 2013, 2014)s h o w e dt h a t“opportunity” (i.e., increased availability of a\nparticular resource will increase the likelihood that chimpanzees will exploit it) was\nmore important than “necessity” (a lack of alternative resources increases the likelihood\nthat chimpanzees will exploit another) in explaining the distribution of some chimpan-\nzee feeding behaviors. Both factors are likely, however, to influence chimpanzee\nbehavior under different conditions [reviewed in Gruber et al .( 2016); for “necessity”\nexerting an influence, see that article and Yamakoshi ( 1998)]. The importance of either\nin explaining the distribution of chimpanzee material culture does not, however, rule\nout a role for cultural override, which makes a clear testable prediction. If cultural\noverride is indeed important in chimpanzees, we can expect to see a mismatch between\nthe availability of resources and the use of tools for exploitation of those resources.\nAbsence of cultural override, at least within the framework of the “opportunity”\nhypothesis, suggests that tool use for a resource should closely follow resource\navailability (to test the necessity hypothesis, we need more information, such as on\navailability of fruit and vertebrate prey).\nIn the current study we compared tool-use north and south of the Uele River in the\nnorthern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and mapped that onto resource\navailability. The Uele River appears to be a chimpanzee barrier (Fig. 1;H i c k s2010),\nand there are major ecological differences on the two sides, with the north being a moist\ntropical forest–savanna mosaic (from here on, mosaic), while the moist tropical lowland\nforest (from here on, lowland forest) to the south lacks the savanna vegetation type. We\nfocused not on these habitat-related differences but on the comparable availability of\nthe insect prey for these two subpopulations. Observing a mismatch in the exploitation\nof these insects despite comparable levels of resource availability would not rule out\necological explanations (particularly relating to the necessity hypothesis) but would at\nleast be consistent with cultural override.\nOur study population is a large and continuous population of Eastern chimpanzees\n(Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii:H i c k set al. 2014), thus minimizing the likelihood that\ngenetic differentiation plays a major role in behavioral differences. We base our\nanalyses in this article on encounter rates of tools found during our large-scale survey\nof chimpanzee material culture (Hicks et al . 2019a), incorporating information on\ninsect availability for key chimpanzee prey species. This study of material traditions\nacross a large and continuous chimpanzee population allows us to document the\ndistribution of nonhuman primate traditions across a climatically and florally hetero-\ngeneous zone following a recent evolutionary history of probably only thousands or\ntens of thousands of years (Hicks et al . 2019a). Investigating the impact of prey\navailability on chimpanzee selection of insects as food items will help us to understand\nthe constraints (or lack thereof) on the evolution of great ape cultures. This study is\nimportant for comparing the tool-use behavior and insectivory of savanna-dwelling\nchimpanzees (such as inhabit the tropical forest –savanna mosaic habitat north of the\nUele River) to those which inhabit the lowland forests south of the Uele.\nWe collected indirect data on tool-assisted predation on insects by chimpanzees at 19\nsurvey regions covering ca. 50,000 km2 in northern DRC (Fig. 1;H i c k set al. 2019a).\nFor 12 of these regions, we also collected data on seasonal variation in the availability\nof surface-swarming, or “epigaeic,” Dorylus ants and ants of the subfamily Ponerinae,\nas well as several species of termites.\nThe Relationship Between Tool Use and Prey Availability in... 939\nFig. 1 The study area in DRC with survey regions labeled.

For the\nanalysis, we combined the regions Akuma and Yoko, which are shown separately here. The 12 survey regions surrounded by black rectangles indicate wher ew ec o l l e c t e di n s e c t\navailability data.\nHicks T.C. et al.940\nMethods\nStudy Area\nBetween 2004 and 2013, the first author (TH) conducted a study of chimpan-\nzees at 19 localities ( “survey regions ”) across a previously un-surveyed area of\nnorthern DRC, between the Tele River in the south and the Mbomu River in\nthe north (ESM 2). Nine of these regions were to north of a major river, the\nUele, and 10 were to its south. Climate and geography north and south of the\nUele are reviewed in Hicks ( 2010). In general, South Uele regions are at a\nlower elevation than North Uele (South Uele range: 380 –600 m; North Uele\nrange: 570 –700 m). During the first half of the twentieth century, the mean\nmaximum (30 vs. 30.1°C, Bambesa South Uele vs. Tukpwo North Uele) and\nminimum daily temperatures (18.2 vs. 19.1°C, Bambesa vs. Tukpwo) were\ncomparable between north and south (Bambesa and Tukpwo data: Gérard\n1960). Despite an overall similar amount of rainfall [Tukpwo, near Bili, prior\nto 1960: 1644 mm (Gérard 1960); Bambesa, South Uele, 1922 –1950: 1779 mm\n(Gérard 1960); Aketi, South Uele, 2007 –2008: 1652 mm (Hicks 2010)], north\nof the Uele the contrast between the wet and dry seasons (dry: December –\nMarch) was more extreme, with no rainfall recorded over a 4-month period for\n2 consecutive seasons (2004 –2005 and 2006 –2007), as befits an area bordering\nthe Sahel zone. This lack of rainfall led to forest streams, some of them >2 m\ndeep in the wet season, disappearing completely in the dry season. We did not\no b s e r v es u c ha ne x t r e m ep a t t e r ni nt h eS o u t hU e l ef o r e s t s .\nThe flora to the north of the Uele River is a vast ecotone characterized by\na mosaic of primary forest, savanna woodland and open grassland which\ngradually becomes more arid and savanna-dominant the further north one\ntravels. Some researchers would classify the Bili –Uéré landscape as a “forest\nmosaic, ” while others would consider it to be a savanna landscape with a\nrelatively high proportion of f orest cover (van Leeuwen et al . 2020). Approx-\nimately half of the area surveyed north of the Uele consisted of savanna-\nassociated vegetation types (op en grassland and savanna woodland,\nrepresented by purple in Fig. 1). South Uele is characterized by moist\nsemideciduous tropical lowland forests, with a complete lack of savannas\n(open grassland or woodland) where we surveyed. On both sides of the Uele,\nnumerous small streams flow across the la ndscape, forming gallery forests to\nthe north. In the south (and somewhat less commonly in the north), the\nborders of these streams are often monodominant stands of Gilbertiodendron\ndewevrei (Gérard 1960;H i c k s pers. obs .). Human population densities are\nmuch higher south of the Uele, leading to higher levels of artisanal mining,\nslash-and-burn agriculture, and hunting (Hicks et al . 2010). Along roads and\nnear villages, natural forests have been replaced by cultivated fields,\nmonodominant stands of oil palms, and dense regenerating forest. In certain\nregions south of the Uele, vast tracts of forests consist of dense herb patches\ncontaining relatively few large trees (Fig. 2;H i c k s 2010;H i c k s et al . 2013).\nThe Relationship Between Tool Use and Prey Availability in... 941\nTree species common in the savanna woodlands and open grasslands north of\nt h eU e l ei n c l u d e Annona senegalensis , Burkea africana , Combretum collinum ,\nHymenocardia acida , Parinari curatelifolia , Stereospernum kunthianum ,\na\nb\nFig. 2 (a) Vegetation types typical of North Uele, DRC (clockwise from top left): Ligada Faustin in open\ngrassland, Bili; TH and Faustin cross a seasonally flooded stream, Gangu Forest (in the dry season, this stream\nvanishes; here it is >2 m deep); Eastern chimpanzee ( Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) in a tree overlooking\nopen grassland, Zapay (just south of the Central African Republic); the 2006 field team crossing seasonally\nburned open grassland, Bili (foreground: Mbolibie Cyprien and Jeroen Swinkels).

In the lowland forests\ntypical of South Uele, common tree species are Julbernardia seretti, Cynometra\nalexandri ,a n d Gilbertiodendron dewevrei (Burgess et al . 2004). For a more\ndetailed description of the vegetation of both areas, please refer to Hicks ( 2010).\nChimpanzees and Tools\nDespite the marked difference between habitat types to the north and south of the\nUele River described in the preceding text (mosaic vs. lowland forest, respective-\nly), Hicks et al .( 2019a) describe a relatively uniform set of chimpanzee material\ntraditions, with stick tools used to obtain five types of insects or their products, the\npounding open of termite mounds and fruits, against substrates and a lack of\nevidence for the consumption of the widely available Macrotermes termites. This\nis perhaps surprising given the differences in habitat types on the two sides of the\nriver. Unlike the bonobos studied in the similar Bolobo ecotone described by\nPennec et al .( 2020), the North Uele chimpanzees frequently foraged, nested, and\nfed in savanna woodland, although evidence of their use of open grasslands was\nrare (Hicks 2010). At 12 of these survey regions (3 to the north of the Uele and 9\nto its south; Fig. 1;E S M 2), TH recorded, in addition to information on chim-\npanzee nests, tools, and other artefacts, data on the availability of several insect\nspecies that are known to be consumed by chimpanzees in northern DRC or at\nother chimpanzee research localities: epigaeic Dorylus (D. terrificus and\nD. wilverthii ) and ponerine ants (mostly Megaponera analis but also Paltothyreus\ntarsatus, both formerly of the genus Pachycondyla )a sw e l la st e r m i t e so ft h e\ngenera Macrotermes, Thoracotermes ,a n d Cubitermes (for more details of the\nmethodology, see Hicks et al . 2019a). Following Schöning et al. (2008), we\nclassified driver ants ( Dorylus) into \"epigaeic\" and \"intermediate\" species: the\nepigaeic ants hunt in massive swarms on and above the ground surface, whereas\nintermediate ones limit their hunting to the leaf litter. The former respond aggres-\nsively to disturbance of their bivouacs or foraging trails, whereas the latter are\ntimid, bite mildly, and generally retreat underground when disturbed. As detailed\nin Hicks et al .( 2019a), we were easily able to disting uish the tool sites of epigaeic\nDorylus and ponerine ants, even when the ants themselves were not present (Fig.\n3). For these latter sites, we assigned resources based strictly on site characteristics\nsuch as presence of insect nests, mounds, and holes (for more details on the\nassignment process, please see Hicks et al . 2019a). We generally found epigaeic\nDorylus bivouacs at the bases of large trees; they consisted of meters-deep\ncavernous holes surrounded by large earthen mounds. Ponerine mounds were\nmuch smaller, had either single holes or were peppered with several tiny ones,\nand we almost never found them at the bases of large trees.\nThe Relationship Between Tool Use and Prey Availability in... 943\nPlant Availability for Tool Construction\nTo assess possible ecological factors influencing differences in uses of tools, we\nexamined the distribution of the plant sources that chimpanzees used to make their\ntools. Using data taken from Hicks et al .( 2019a), as well as the results of the\nsurveys of Gérard ( 1960) and the Ituri Dynamics Plots conducted by C. Ewango in\nRFO, Ituri Forest (see Makana et al . 2004 for details of this survey), we compiled\ndata detailing the availability of plants used in tool construction.\nStatistical Analysis\nOriginally, we aimed to model the extent to which insect availability explained\ntool use. To this end, we first modeled seasonal variation in insect availability.\nThese models indeed revealed seasonal var iation but the absolute variation was\nvery limited. Although we found a weak trend for higher encounter rates of\nepigaeic Dorylus to the north, the differences in encounter rates between ponerine\nand epigaeic Dorylus to the north vs. south of the Uele River were not significant\n(ESM 3). Hence, we decided to not account for insect availability in the models of\ntool use. For details of the methods and results of models of insect availability, see\nESM 3.\nFig. 3 (a) An epigaeic Dorylus mound with a long probe projecting from a deep hole, found in the Gangu\nForest, North Uele, DRC, August 15, 2012 (photo by Gilbert Pakulu).

(d) A ponerine ant from a tool site in the Buta Forest, South Uele.\nHicks T.C. et al.944\nWe compared encounter rates of Dorylus and ponerine tool sites, respectively,\nnorth and south of the Uele using generalized linear models (McCullagh and\nNelder 1998) with a negative binomial ( Dorylus) or Poisson error distribution\n(ponerine) and a log link function (i.e., there was only one key predictor in the\nmodel, namely the factor “location,” with levels “North Uele” and “South Uele”). We\ninitially accounted for spatial autocorrelation in both models, but since it appeared negative\nin the Dorylusmodel we removed it from that model. To account for the varying sampling\neffort, we included the number of kilometers (log transformed) walked per site as an offset\nterm. To account for variation in chimpanzee densities between survey sites, we included as\na proxy for chimpanzee abundance an additional offset term the (log transformed) number of\nnests per kilometer walked (McCullagh and Nelder1998). Sample size for both models was\n19 sites, and none of them was overdispersed (dispersion parameters, Dorylus: 1.093;\nponerine: 0.552). We evaluated model stability by means of DFBeta values (Field 2005).\nWe fitted the models in R (version 3.4.4; R Core Team2018) using the functions glm.nb of\nthe package MASS (version 7.3-50; Venables and Ripley2002)o rg l m .\nEthical Note\nWe report that no conflicts of interest exist in the publication of this article. The\nCongolese field assistants depicted in Fig. 2 worked as guides for our research project\nand gave TH verbal consent to use their photographs in published articles. The\ncollection of the abundant and widely distributed driver ant and ponerine species was\nin accordance with the research permit granted by the Congolese Ministry of\nEnvironment.\nData Availability Most of the datasets used in our analyses can be found in the\nSupplementary Materials (see Table SIIA,T a b l e SIIB,T a b l e SIII). Any other data\nused for analysis in the current study are available from the corresponding author\non reasonable request.\nResults\nTool Use and Insect Availability\nWe found epigaeic Dorylus and ponerine ants on both sites of the Uele River. We\nalso documented epigaeic Dorylus and ponerine ant tools and tool sites north and\nsouth of the Uele (Table I). For epigaeic Dorylus ants, tool site encounter rates\nwere significantly higher north of the Uele River, and the chimpanzees used a long\ntool type not found to the south (Table II;F i g . 4a). These “long ant probes, ”\ndescribed in detail in Hicks et al .( 2019a), could reach 2.45 m in length, and had a\nmean length of 1.2 m; thus they are the longest tools known so far to be used by\nchimpanzees to prey on insects in Africa. To the south of the Uele, we found only\none epigaeic Dorylus tool site, and the two tools there were short (74.5 and 63.1\nThe Relationship Between Tool Use and Prey Availability in... 945\ncm). For ponerine ants, we found no significant difference between tool site\nencounter rates north and south of the Uele (Table III;F i g . 4b).\nPlant Species Availability for Tool Construction\nA considerable fraction of the plant species used for making tools north of the Uele\nRiver were also present to the south of it. Many of these plants are widespread across\nnorthern DRC (Table IV;E S M4). In the Discussion, we will refer to this table to address\nwhether availability of these species may differentially influence the use of tools by\nchimpanzees to prey on epigaeic Dorylus to the north and south of the Uele River.\nTable I Epigaeic (Ep.)

This was not the case with ponerine tool\nsite encounter rates. We found tools for epigaeic Dorylus at only 1 of the 10 South Uele\nsurvey regions, but at 6 of the 9 North Uele sites (Table I). In addition, we found no\nlong epigaeic Dorylus probes (Hicks et al. 2019a) south of the Uele River, where all of\nthe tools were short.

We include only those plants known\nto be used by the northern DRC chimpanzees to construct tools to prey on epigaeic Dorylus ants, given that it\nis the difference in this behavior north vs. south of the Uele River that needs to be explained.

See ESM 4 for a more general list of plant types, which includes plants\nidentified only to the genus.\na Common.\nb Present in the understory in many places.\nc On Epulu River islands only, not recorded in forest.\nHicks T.C. et al.948\ngrassland and savanna –woodland dominated Zapay and Gbangadi we found some of\nthe highest tool encounter rates. Despite the robust difference in epigaeic Dorylus tool\nencounter rates on the two sides of the river, we must remain cautious in our interpre-\ntation, as a weak trend existed for higher encounter rates of epigaeic Dorylus ants to the\nnorth of the Uele River; thus we cannot completely rule out that the chimpanzees there\nmay have an increased opportunity to prey on this species.\nEnvironmental conditions may also have an effect on the preservation of primate\nmaterial culture (Falótico et al . 2017;N d i a y eet al . 2018;S t e w a r t2011). We cannot\nentirely rule out the potential confound that stick tools may have different decay rates\nbased on either location (i.e., north vs. south of the Uele River, two areas characterized\nby major ecological differences) or season (whether we conducted our surveys in the\nwet vs. dry seasons). Of the 239 stick tools described in Hicks et al. ( 2019a)t h a tw e r e\nused to prey on all species of insects or their products, however, the encounter rate was\nnearly identical to the north and south of the Uele River [North Uele: 211 stick tools on\n2858.1 km of surveys (0.07 per km); South Uele: 28 tools on 440.8 km of surveys (0.06\nper km); see Additional Data of that paper]. In addition, a difference in decay rates of\nsticks between the north and south would not account for the fact that more ponerine\ntools were found to the north than to the south (although the difference was not\nsignificant), vs. the opposite pattern for Dorylus tools. Although population densities\nof chimpanzees may be higher to the south than to the north (Hicks et al. 2014), which\ncould affect the tool encounter rates, this also would fail to account for the pattern we\nobserved. Finally, 19 of the 27 South Uele stick tools for which age was recorded\n(70%) were fresh or recent, compared to 69% (89 of 130) of the presumed ant tools\nnorth of the Uele, indicating a similar decay rate on both sides of the river (Hicks\nunpubl. data). Thus it is unlikely that the different predominant habitat types of these\ntwo areas led to a higher probability of tools being found in one area than the other.\nAs we walked somewhat different proportions of survey lengths north and south of\nthe Uele River in the dry and wet seasons (North Uele dry season: 613.8 of 2858 km\nwalked, or 22%; South Uele dry season: 174.9 of 440.8 km walked, or 40%), we\ncannot rule out seasonality as a factor contributing to differences in encounter rates with\nthe different kinds of tools [see Additional Data 1 in Hicks et al .( 2019b)]. The\nencounter rate of tools in the south during the dry season/total tools was higher than\nthat to the north: North tools dry season/total tools: 35 out of 211 tools, or 16.6%; South\ntools dry season/total tools: 8 out of 28, or 28.6% (Hicks et al . 2019a). Unfortunately,\nwe could not incorporate seasonality of the tools found into our model as we did for\ninsect availability. Because tools may survive for months after being used, it was\nimpossible to determine during which season many of the tools had been made.\nNevertheless, given the overall similarity of tool encounter rates to the north and south\nof the Uele, we consider seasonality to be an unlikely explanation for our findings. This\nis supported by the fact that we were equally likely to find ponerine tool sites, unlike\nepigaeic Dorylus ones, in the two areas.\nDifferences in vegetation types for ponerine vs. epigaeic Dorylus tools may have\nhad some impact on preservability of, or likelihood of finding, these tools. Although we\nfound the majority of both tool types in mixed forest, there were some differences: in\nthe north, epigaeic Dorylus tool sites but not ponerine ones were often associated with\nsavanna woodland or within a few meters of open grassland (20% of sites); we were\nmore likely to find ponerine ant tools than Dorylus ones in Gilbertiodendron dewevrei\nThe Relationship Between Tool Use and Prey Availability in... 949\nforest (7% of sites) or herb patches (17% sites) (Hicks et al. 2019a). We found epigaeic\nDorylus tools more frequently in medium-density forest. Nevertheless, we found the\nmajority of both tool types in mixed forest; thus it is unlikely that differences in habitat\ntype north vs. south of the Uele can explain the almost complete absence of epigaeic\nDorylus tools to the south, nor the extreme length of the northern tools. Although the\nobserved patterns of resource use are at least consistent with cultural override (Gruber\net al . 2009), our lack of comparable ecological data between northern DRC and other\nchimpanzee sites in Africa means that we cannot rule out the influence of particular\necological characteristics unique to northern DRC.\nPonerine ants are common across Africa but, based on years of study at numerous\nsites, chimpanzees very rarely consume them with or without tools (reviewed in Hicks\net al. 2019a). These insects were nevertheless frequently preyed upon using tools by the\nchimpanzees across our study area.\nThe predominant habitat types differed considerably north and south of the Uele\nRiver (mosaic vs. lowland forest), and yet chimpanzees consumed ponerine ants\nacross the study area. Ponerine ants themselves did not appear to be particularly\nabundant at Bili, compared to Gombe, where these ants are not consumed (Hicks\net al . 2019a).\nLangergraber et al .( 2010) highlighted the difficulty of disentangling genetic influ-\nences on behavior from cultural ones [ cf. Marshall-Pescini and Whiten ( 2008a), who\ndocumented the learning of nut-cracking behavior by Eastern chimpanzees in a sanc-\ntuary, for a way forward], and such influences cannot easily be ruled out. As is the case\nwith humans, purely genetic explanations for behavioral variation between populations\nare perhaps unlikely in a species such as chimpanzees with their long lives, complex\nbehavior, and heavy dependence on social learning (McGrew 2004). In addition, the\ninterconnectivity (and thus likely genetic homogeneity) of our study population [see\nHicks et al .( 2014) for the argument that the South and North Uele chimpanzees are\nlikely connected as a population in a belt around the Uele River until it thins and\ndisappears to the east], as well as the relatively recent divergence of all Eastern\nchimpanzees from an ancestral population (Fünfstück et al . 2015; Gagneux et al .\n2001) make it extremely unlikely that genetic differences between subpopulations in\nnorthern DRC explain our findings.\nAlthough it is unlikely that the availability of the food resource itself, epigaeic\nDorylus ants, explains the difference in both likelihood of tool use and the lengths\nof the tools used to prey upon the ants, ot her subtle ecological or prey behavior\ndifferences between the north and south of the Uele River are much more difficult to\nrule out and prevent us from reaching strong conclusions. As an example of the\ncomplexity of ecological factors, a lack of availability of sodium from decaying\nlogs may push chimpanzees in some forests to dip for driver ants for their salt\ncontent (R. Wrangham pers. comm.). Koops et al .( 2019) propose that the reason\nthat chimpanzees at Seringbara, Guinea, eat fewer driver ants when they have\naccess to crabs is that the crabs present an alternative source of sodium. As another\nexample, red colobus monkeys ( Piliocolobus spp.), the preferred primate prey of\nchimpanzees across Africa (reviewed in McGrew 2004), are absent from North\nUele but present to the south (Hicks et al . 2019b). Although the North Uele\nchimpanzees consume animal protein, perhaps the lack of red colobus leads them\nto consume more epigaeic Dorylus ants than their conspecifics to the south (other\nHicks T.C. et al.950\npopulations of chimpanzees, however, such as at Gombe, both hunt for red colobus\nand use tools to prey on driver ants). The ease of coming up with such possibilities\ndemonstrates how difficult it is to excl ude subtle ecological factors as drivers of\nbehaviors. Here we will address several other possible confounds that may influ-\nence our conclusions, including variation in insect behavior or edibility, ecological\nand climatic factors, and plant availability.\nInsect Behavior or Edibility\nDifferences in the behavior or edibility of the insect species themselves between the\nnorth and south of the Uele might explain our findings. Möbius et al .( 2008), for\ninstance, found that interpopulation differences in driver ant behavior contributed to\ndifferences in the tools used by chimpanzees to prey upon them (Möbius et al . 2008).\nPerhaps, in a similar manner, there is something different about the behavior of the\nepigaeic Dorylus ants to the north of the Uele River that requires the chimpanzees to\nuse long tools to catch them, thus explaining our findings. Both epigaeic species\nD. wilverthii and D. terrificus are present on both sides of the Uele River, and the\nchimpanzees ate them in both places (Hicks et al . 2019a). North Uele chimpanzees\npreyed on D. wilverthii with tools, and D. terrificus appeared in their dung. South Uele\nchimpanzees used tools to prey on D. terrificus, and we found D. wilverthii in a dung\nsample (Hicks et al. 2019a). These species are known to be consumed elsewhere (i.e.,\nKalinzu, Uganda) by chimpanzees using tools (Schöning et al . 2008).\nFrom personal experience, TH can attest that epigaeic Dorylus to the north and south\nof the Uele were similarly aggressive, swarming rapidly and delivering painful bites\nupon provocation. We know from remains in dung samples and one tool site that South\nUele chimpanzees eat these ants (Hicks et al. 2019a); thus it is unlikely that palatability\nis an issue. Epigaeic Dorylus holes north of the Uele were significantly deeper than\nother insect holes we measured (Hicks et al . 2019a), but we lack measurements from\nsouth of the Uele for comparison purposes. It is striking that multiple populations of\nchimpanzees use tools to prey upon multiple species of epigaeic Dorylus in environ-\nments ranging from savanna to tropical forest (reviewed in Schöning et al . 2008 and\nSanz et al. 2010), and yet for the most part those tools are nowhere near as long as the\nNorth Uele ones (Hicks et al . 2019a). As we cannot rule out that some feature as the\nNorth Uele ants themselves may promote the use of these long tools, we require more\ncomparative studies of the characteristics of these ants on both sides of the Uele River,\nin relation to those consumed by chimpanzees elsewhere.\nSoil Hardness, Seasonality, Dryness, and Other Ecological and Climatic Factors\nMajor differences exist between the habitats north and south of the Uele River, in both\nseasonality of rainfall (less seasonality further south), soil makeup (more exposed\nlaterite in the northern savannas, possibly more swamp forest to the south), and degree\nof human disturbance, including hunting, mining, and agriculture (Hicks 2010). Such\nfactors, which are poorly understood in our survey area, may impact the behavior of the\nchimpanzees, both in terms of the differences between epigaeic Dorylus tool use to the\nnorth and south and overarching differences between the chimpanzees of northern DRC\nand those at other sites in Africa. For instance, differences in soil composition or\nThe Relationship Between Tool Use and Prey Availability in... 951\nhardness may affect the depth of driver ant holes or the hardness of termite mounds. As\nan example of the indirect manner in which ecological factors can affect complex\nchimpanzee behavior, Boesch (1994) argued that a closed canopy forest can lead to the\napes developing complex strategies to hunt monkeys, compared to simpler strategies\nused in forests with more broken cover.\nAny such explanation would need to account for the fact that chimpanzees use tools\nto prey on both driver ants and Macrotermes spp. at multiple sites across Africa with\ndiverse climatic and geological features. Likewise, chimpanzees generally ignore\nCubitermites and Thoracotermes spp. at those sites. Perhaps some constellation of\nfeatures explains the unique distribution of such tool-use and food-processing behav-\niors across northern DRC. Culture may provide a more parsimonious explanation, but\nfor the moment, lacking comparative studies, we must withhold judgment.\nAvailability of Plant Species to Construct Tools\nPerhaps differences in the abundance or distribution of raw materials used for tool\nconstruction exist across the area, which might explain the differences in epigaeic\nDorylus tool use north vs. south of the Uele River. It might be argued that a particular\nkind of stick that is abundant north of the Uele serves as an excellent raw material for\nfashioning these long stick probes. This is unlikely, however, as, the four survey\nregions in which we found no tools (Hicks et al. 2019a) were located in dense lowland\nforest, which offered abundant saplings. Open, savanna-dominant regions, namely\nZapay and Gbangadi, where potentially fewer sticks might be available for tool\nmanufacture, had some of the highest tool encounter rates found, for multiple types\nof insects, including two epigaiec Dorylus sites at Zapay.\nThe possibility that a differential availability of plant tool sources might explain our\nresults is undercut by the fact that the North Uele chimpanzees did not depend on any\nparticular plant species to hunt epigaeic Dorylus ants with their long stick probes.\nInstead, the chimpanzees used a wide diversity of plant species (29) to make those 54\ntools (Hicks et al . 2019a). Although our data on plant species availability to the south\nof the Uele River are incomplete, many of the plants used by the chimpanzees to make\nepigaeic Dorylus tools to the north were widely available across the area (Table IV;s e e\nESM 4 for a detailed discussion). Of the 16 epigaeic Dorylus tool plant source species\nfrom North Uele, 9 were shared between North and South Uele forests (Gérard 1960),\nand 14 of these also occur in the Ituri Forest far to the east. If we expand sources to\ninclude those identified to the genus level, 17 were shared between North and South\nUele and 19 occur in Ituri (ESM 4, Table SIV); thus it is unlikely that a difference in\noccurrence of these plants was a limiting factor for tool use south of the Uele.\nIn summary, the Bili–Uéré chimpanzees were not obviously limited to using specific\nplant species to prey on epigaeic Dorylus ants and instead were quite flexible in their\nchoice of materials (Table IV; ESM 4, Table SIII;H i c k s et al . 2019a), making it\nunlikely that the availability of specific plants was a limiting factor for them in\nconstructing their tools. Thus the opportunity hypothesis is not supported by our data.\nIn the future, however, systematic comparisons should be made between densities of\nthese plant species north and south of the Uele and not just presence/absence.\nHicks T.C. et al.952\nDiverse Habitat in Northern DRC Makes Ecological Explanations for Distribution\nof Bili–Uéré Behavioral Realm Unlikely\nDespite the interregional differences in tool use for epigaeic Dorylus ants and a few\nother behaviors, we see when adopting a pan-African perspective that the behaviors of\nthe northern DRC chimpanzees are surprisingly uniform across a large geographical\narea (Hicks et al . 2019a). The habitat types to the north and south of the Uele River\nwere quite different: mosaic vs. lowland forest, respectively (Fig. 1), and the climate of\nNorth Uele is more seasonal (Hicks 2010). It is thus unlikely that any overarching\necological similarity shared across the two sides of the river might explain the\nbehavioral continuity found in northern DRC chimpanzees. This similarity of behaviors\nis perhaps surprising given that drier woodland or grassland habitats may exert different\nphysiological or environmental pressures on chimpanzees than wetter, more forested\nones (Wessling et al . 2018; Boyer-Ontl and Pruetz, this issue). Without any obvious\necological factor promoting behavioral convergence in the chimpanzees of northern\nDRC, this relatively uniform set of behaviors (sticks used to prey on ants, termite\nmound pounding, lack of termite fishing, and ground nesting) may be explained by\n“cultural override ” (Gruber et al . 2009). Given the relatively recent divergence and\nexpansion of Eastern chimpanzees (Lobon et al . 2016) and the interconnectedness of\nmuch of their population (Hicks et al . 2014), too little time may have passed to allow\nthe diversification of traditions as a response to new environments. These chimpanzees\nmay have maintained their culture in the face of novel environmental conditions\nencountered over the past few thousand or tens of thousands of years during range\nexpansion. Alternatively, or additionally, perhaps any cultural innovation has been\nrapidly drowned out by immigrations between the many interconnected communities,\nreinforcing conservative traditions (Hicks 2010). Although it is difficult to know how\nfast or slow nonhuman great ape traditions can take to develop, future research on this\nlarge, continuous population, especially when combined with refined knowledge of\ntheir evolutionary history, will be informative.\nWithin this “Behavioral Realm,” on opposite sides of the Uele River, we may have\ndetected some regional divergence in tool types used to prey on epigaeic Dorylus,a s\nwell as food preferences (Hicks et al . 2019b), despite the interconnectivity of the\npopulation as a whole. These possible different tool-use styles and “tastes” may\nrepresent incipient behavioral differentiation across a large geographic area within a\nstill-interconnected chimpanzee population. Our findings for epigaeic Dorylusc o n t r a -\ndict the viewpoint that specific ecological conditions “draw out” chimpanzee tool-use\nbehaviors from an innate ability [i.e., the Tennie et al.( 2009) “zone of latent solutions ”\nhypothesis]. Although Koops et al .( 2013, 2014) demonstrated convincingly that\n“opportunity” (i.e., ecological conditions/availability of resources) shapes chimpanzee\ntraditions in much the same way it does for humans, our results for epigaeic Dorylus\n(but not ponerine ants) are consistent with the view that chimpanzee feeding traditions\nmay, like those of humans, sometimes be constrained by cultural override (Gruber et al.\n2009, 2011). Before we can be certain of this, however, we need to know for how long\nthe chimpanzees on both sides of the Uele River have been separated from one another,\nas they apparently are today in the Bili –Uéré area (Hicks 2010). This knowledge would\ngive us a time frame allowing to track the pace of the differentiation of these possible\nincipient traditions. We can also ask ourselves whether we are we missing some hidden\nThe Relationship Between Tool Use and Prey Availability in... 953\necological factor that may explain why chimpanzees in the north use more tools (and a\ndifferent kind of tool) to prey on driver ants. The “necessity hypothesis” may come into\nplay in ways that are difficult to detect (Grund et al. 2019). For example, it could be that\na lack of salt in the seasonally drier landscape to the north of the Uele River encourages\nthese apes to focus more on targeting epigaeic Dorylus (Koops et al. 2019). Or perhaps\nthe absence of red colobus monkeys (the preferred chimpanzee prey wherever the two\nspecies occur together in Africa) in the north leads to an increased consumption of ants.\nThese are only possibilities, however, and not very likely ones for Bili –Uéré. Given that\nepigaeic Dorylus are consumed elsewhere both at deep forest sites [i.e., Goualogou\n(Sanz and Morgan 2007) and Taï (Boesch and Boesch 1990) and savanna ones [i.e.,\nFongoli (Bogart and Pruetz 2011) and Assirik (Hunt and McGrew 2002) ] ,a sw e l la si n\nforests where chimpanzees are known to hunt red colobus, no simple correlates with\necological conditions seem to exist.\nLack of Tool Use to Acquire Macrotermes Supports the Argument for Cultural\nOverride\nIn addition to their apparently limited use of tools to consume aggressive\nDorylus in the south, chimpanzees appear to ignore the abundant Macrotermes\nsp. termites in northern DRC (Hicks et al . 2019a), while these insects are\npreyed upon with tools by multiple other chimpanzee populations. As they do\nelsewhere, Macrotermes muelleri termites in northern DRC travel in surface\nswarms and are edible for humans; our Za nde assistants at Bili prized their\nflavor and foraged for them by hand when we encountered their swarms. We\ncan thus probably exclude the possibility that some unique defensive behavior\nof these termites explains their appar ent absence from the diet of the Bili –Uéré\nchimpanzees (Hicks et al . 2019a). We cannot, however, rule out that some\nother unknown difference between this and other populations (i.e., mound\nhardness or reluctance of soldiers to bite onto probes) may explain this (lack\nof) behavior. Given that chimpanzees use tools to prey on Macrotermes spp.\nacross a diverse range of habitats in Africa, ranging from savannas (Fongoli:\nBogart and Pruetz 2011) to tropical rainforest (Goualougo: Sanz and Morgan\n2007) and everything in between (reviewed in McGrew 1992 and Webster et al .\n2014), it is perhaps difficult to envisage a salient and all-encompassing differ-\nence in northern DRC Macrotermes muelleri that would explain the apparent\nabsence of this insect from the diet of the chimpanzees across a large and\necologically diverse area. This lack of termite-fishing is shared by the Semliki\nchimpanzees (Webster et al . 2014), where Macrotermes sp. are common. We do\nnot know if the latter absence is connected to the widespread Bili –Uéré\ntradition. At Bili –Uéré, the behavior appears to be absent not only from\nlowland forest, but from mosaic as well, making the Semliki savanna-\nassociated “reduced handling time ” hypothesis unlikely to apply, at least to\nthe non-moist tropical lowland fores t habitat. A similar pattern can be seen\nregarding the nearly unique termite mound-pounding behavior found across a\nlarge area of northern DRC, focused on Cubitermes sp. and Thoracotermes\nmacrothorax (Hicks et al . 2019a). These patterns of behavior are at least\nconsistent with cultural override.\nHicks T.C. et al.954\nThe Relationship Between Tool Use and Prey Availability in... 955\nConclusions\nChimpanzee material culture is clearly influenced to some degree by the ecological\navailability of resources (Koops et al. 2013, 2014). In addition, chimpanzees may, like\nhumans, bring their own cultural preferences and predilections to the table (Gruber\net al. 2009;W e b s t e ret al. 2014;W h i t e n2017, 2019), leading to cultural override. The\nmismatch between resource availability and tool use that we documented in this article\nand in Hicks et al .( 2019a) is consistent with this hypothesis, although we cannot rule\nout less obvious ecological influences. On a larger scale, the relative behavioral\nuniformity of the northern DRC chimpanzees across a wide range of habitats (Hicks\net al. 2019a) indicates that these hominids, instead of responding passively to whatever\nfood sources happen to be common around them, may conservatively follow deeply\ningrained traditions as to what they regard as food and how they fashion their tools,\nwhich differ from those of other well-studied populations of the species. Nevertheless,\nsubtle differences in prey preference and tool construction may indicate a degree of\nburgeoning behavioral divergence within this area. To speculate, perhaps at Bili –Uéré\nwe are catching the evolution of incipient chimpanzee traditions in the act.\nIn northern DRC, we have an almost unprecedented opportunity to observe the\nspread of culture in one of our closest hominid relatives across large geographic\ndistances of interconnected habitat. Such areas are becoming increasingly rare in\ntoday’s human-dominated landscape. Not only should this motivate us to protect these\npriceless chimpanzee traditions, but to document them as well, before they are damaged\nor destroyed by human incursion. A stroke of luck has allowed this population to\nsurvive; it is up to us to ensure it does so into the future.\nAcknowledgments We thank the Ministère de l ’Environnement of the DRC and the Institut Congolais pour\nla Conservation de la Nature (ICCN) for granting us permission to work in the DRC.
