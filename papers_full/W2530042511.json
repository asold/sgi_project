INTRODUCTION\nThe disadvantage of low power switched mode flyback\nconverter is leakage inductance phenomenon of flyback\ntransformer [1]–[3]. It causes increase of voltage spikes\ngenerated during the switch commutation. The energy\nconsumed for generati on of voltage spikes lowers the\nefficiency of flyback converter [1]–[8]. The overvoltage\nclamp circuits have to be employed for spike suppression to\navoid the breakdown of switch transistors [3], [5]–[6].\nThe theoretical analysis or simulation means are us ed\nusually for analysis of flyback transformer design impact on\nvoltage spikes [1]–[6]. However, any model cannot take into\naccount all phenomena . Additionally, it is complicated to\ndetermine the values of transformer model parameters.\nBecause of this, the accuracy of flyback transformers\nsimulation is limited [1], [5], [9] . Therefore, the\nexperimental investigation means have to be used to obtain\naccurate results . The purpose of this work is to investigate\nthe impact of flyback transformer design on voltage spikes in\nconverter caused by the leakage inductance . The\ninvestigation was performed for cases when transformer\nwindings are p laced using interleaving and sandwich\nmethods [1] and two methods proposed by authors.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL MODEL OF FLYBACK TRANSFORMER\nThe core of flyback transformer has air gap. Therefore,\nthe flux, which does not link the primary and secondary\nManuscript received 20 December, 2015; accepted 11 May, 2016\nwindings, is increased relative to the flux that links these\nwindings. Because of this, the link between the primary and\nsecondary windings i s weakened [1], [4]. The part of flux\nthat is located outside the core of transformer introduces the\nleakage inductance, which causes undesirable phenomenon –\nthe voltage spikes on the drain of flyback converter\nMOSFET switch transistor (Fig. 1).\nFig. 1. Transient of drain voltage of flyback converter MOSFET switch\ntransistor.\nThe leakage inductance is proportional to magnetomotive\nforce between the windings that act s in air gap of core [5]\n(Fig. 2). Magnetomotive force F(x), which causes leakage\nmagnetic field, depends on geometry of transformer\nwindings\n( ) ( ) , wF x H x l (1)\nwhere ) (x His magnetic field strength.\nThe leakage flux in air gap of core is much lower than\nflux in core. This happens because the perm eability of\nmagnetic core µ is much higher than air permeability µ0. The\nµ decreases and, as a consequence, the leakage inductance\nincreases if the transformer core saturates. The air gap in the\ncore of the flyback transformer weakens the link between\nwindings as well.\nThe e xperimental model of transformer was made using\nETD-34 type ferrite core with magnetic material N27. The\ntransformer has 15 windings, every winding has 10 turns\nmade of copper conductor with 0.6 mm 2 cross-section area\n(Fig. 3).

The\nmagnetic field leakage phenomena come into play stronger\nwhen the transformer core gap increases significantly.\nTherefore, the voltage spikes at 1 mm and 2 mm core gap\nare higher as compared to the case when 0.7 mm gap is used\n(Fig. 5).\nThe dependence of voltage spikes on quantity of parallel\nconnected windings, which form secondary winding, was\ninvestigated. The investigation was performed for 16 V\nconverter output voltage, 35 kHz switching frequency and\n1 mm transformer core air gap. The investigated transformer\nprimary and secondary windings connection variant s are\n59\nELEKTRONIKA IR ELEKTROTECHNIKA, ISSN 1392-1215, VOL. 22, NO. 5, 2016\ngiven in Table III. The obtained results are presented in\nFig. 6.\nFig. 5. The dependences of v oltage spikes on flyback converter output\npower at various transformer core air gap dimensions at 35 kHz switching\nfrequency.\nFig. 6. The dependences of voltage spikes on flyback converter output\npower at various quantities of parallel connected windings (Table III),\nwhich form secondary winding of transformer, at 1 mm core air gap and 35\nkHz switching frequency.\nIt is seen that parallel connection of windings, which form\nsecondary winding of transformer, allows us decrease the\nvoltage spikes. The voltage spikes decreases from 650 V to\n565 V at 50 W output power when instead of one win ding\ntwo parallel connected windings are used. The connection of\nthird winding allows reducing the voltage spikes up to\n520 V. However, the further increase of parallel connected\nwindings quantity does not influence the value of voltage\nspikes significantly.\nThe voltage spike reduction phenomena can be explained\nby the fac t that in case when only one winding is used , the\nmagnetomotive force in air gap between primary and\nsecondary windings (Fig. 2) is damped weakly by the\nsecondary winding. This happens because the secondary\nwinding is on the edge of bo bbin (Fig. 3(b)) and damps only\nthe magnetomotive force created by the 1 and 7 windings,\ntherefore, the magnetomotive forces developed by the 2, 3, 8\nand 9 windings are not damped, because of this, the leakage\ninductance and , as a consequence, the voltage spikes in\nprimary win ding, increase. If the secondary winding is\ncreated using three in parallel connected windings, the\nprimary windings of transformer are covere d by secondary\nwindings (Fig. 3(b)). Therefore, the flux, which links the\nprimary and secondary windings and, as a consequence, the\nlink between the primary and secondary windings increases\ndecreasing the leakage inductance.\nThe obtained results (Fig. 6) show that employment of\nsecondary winding in flyback transformer using parallel\nconnected windings reduces the voltage spikes by 25 % and\nvoltage overshoot by 67 % at 50 W output power. Therefore,\nthe power losses caused by the overshoot dissipated in\npassive clamp circuit and, as a consequence, the power\nlosses of flyback converter are reduced.\nThe impact of windings location in transformer bobbin on\nflyback converter voltage spikes was investigated. The\ninvestigation was performed for 16 V converter output\nvoltage, 35 kHz switching frequency and 1 mm transformer\ncore air gap. The investigat ion was performed for seven\ntransformer primary and secondary windings connection\n(location in transformer bobbin ) variants. The connection\nvariants of windings are given in Table IV. It is seen that in\nall variants the sec ondary winding is formed using six in\nparallel connected windings, however, the location of\nwindings in various variants was different . In the similar\nway, the various variants of serial connection of windings\nused for forming of primary winding were investigated. The\nobtained results are presented in Fig. 7.\nTABLE IV.

The dependences of voltage spikes on flyback converter output\npower for transformer windings connection variants 1-7 (Table IV) at\n1 mm core air gap and 35 kHz switching frequency.\nIn the case when transformer windings connection is\nperformed using 1 (the primary winding is under t he\nsecondary winding (Fig. 3)) and 2 (the primary winding is\nover the secondary winding (Fig.3)) variants (Table IV), the\novervoltage is higher as compared to the 3 and 4 variants\n(interleaving method), 5 variant ( sandwich method). This\nhappens because in case of interleaving and sandwich\nplacing methods of windings the leakage inductance is lower\nas compared to the 1 and 2 variants.\nThe two p lacing methods of windings proposed by\nauthors: chess interleaving (variant 6, Table IV) method and\nmethod when prim ary and secondary windings are\nconcentrated at the borders of bobbin (variant 7, Table IV)\n60\nELEKTRONIKA IR ELEKTROTECHNIKA, ISSN 1392-1215, VOL. 22, NO. 5, 2016\nhave been investigated as well. The obtained results show\n(Fig. 7) that variant 6 provides slightly lower spikes as\ncompared to 3 -5 variants at power up to 120 W . However,\nthe results become worse at higher power. The highest\nspikes are generated in case when windings are placed using\nvariant 7 (Fig. 7).\nThe energy of overshoot, which arises during the voltage\nspike (Fig. 1) is dissipated in the resistor of passive c lamp\ncircuit R1. Additionally, the powe r caused by the output\nvoltage reflected to the primary winding is dissipated in\nresistor R1. The reflected voltage ( URO) appears when the\ndiode D1 (Fig. 4) conducts the current of the secondary\nwinding. URO delivers additional energy to clamp circuit\nresistor R1. URO can be calculated using equation\n  pri\nRO OUT D\nsec\n,\nn\nU U U n  (2)\nwhere UD is voltage drop across forward biased diode D1,\nnpri and nsec are number of primary and secondary windings\nturns, respectively. It is seen that at constant UOUT the URO is\nconstant, i.e. the power dissipation in R1 caused by reflected\nvoltage (PREFL) is constant.\nThe total power dissipat ed in the resistor R1 can be\nobtained by measurement of integral value of voltage drop\nacross the resi stor URint and calculating of pow er losses by\nfollowing equation\n2\nRint\nTOT\n1\n.UP R (3)\nFig. 8. The dependence of power losses caused by the voltage overshoot\ndissipated in passive clamp circuit resistor R1. The core air gap 0.7 mm,\nswitching frequency 35 kHz and 50 kHz.\nThe power caused by the overshoot, which is dissipated in\npassive clamp circuit resistor R1, is obtained as difference\nPOVER = PTOT – PREFL. The dependence of power losses\ncaused by the overshoot on flyback converter output power\nfor the situation when core air gap width is 0.7 mm,\nswitching frequency 35 kHz and 50 kHz are presented in\nFig. 8. It is seen that the power losses in clamp circuit\nresistor R1 increases with the output power and are slightly\nhigher at higher switching frequency.\nIt is seen that law of dependence of power losses caused\nby the voltage overshoots (Fig. 8, curve that corresponds to\n35 kHz) and law of voltage spikes dependence (Fig. 5, curve\nthat corresponds to 0.7 mm air gap) on converter output\npower coincid e. This fact supports the proposition that\npower losses presented by the curves given in Fig. 8 are\ncaused by the voltage overshoots.\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\nThe enlargement of flyback transformer core air gap\nreduces the converter switch transistor drain voltage spik es,\nwhich become minimal at 0.7 mm air gap. However, at\nlarger dimension of air gap the voltage s pikes increase\nbecause the magnetic field leakage phenomena come into\nplay stronger.\nThe parallel connection of windings, which form\nsecondary winding of trans former, allows us decrease the\nvoltage spikes from 650 V to 520 V at 50 W output power\nwhen instead of one winding three parallel connected\nwindings are used.\nThe proposed chess interleaving p lacing method of\nflyback transformer windings provides lowest s pikes at\npower up to 120 W as compared to another investigated\nmethods.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Z.
