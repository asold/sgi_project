  "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant potential to transform various aspects of healthcare. This review aims to explore the current applications, challenges, and future prospects of LLMs in medical education, clinical decision support, and healthcare administration. Methods: A comprehensive literature review was conducted, examining the applications of LLMs across the three key domains. The analysis included their performance, challenges, and advancements, with a focus on techniques like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Results: In medical education, LLMs show promise as virtual patients, personalized tutors, and tools for generating study materials. Some models have outperformed junior trainees in specific medical knowledge assessments. Concerning clinical decision support, LLMs exhibit potential in diagnostic assistance, treatment recommendations, and medical knowledge retrieval, though performance varies across specialties and tasks. In healthcare administration, LLMs effectively automate tasks like clinical note summarization, data extraction, and report generation, potentially reducing administrative burdens on healthcare professionals. Despite their promise, challenges persist, including hallucination mitigation, addressing biases, and ensuring patient privacy and data security. Conclusions: LLMs have transformative potential in medicine but require careful integration into healthcare settings. Ethical considerations, regulatory challenges, and interdisciplinary collaboration between AI developers and healthcare professionals are essential. Future advancements in LLM performance and reliability through techniques such as RAG, fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning will be critical to ensuring patient safety and improving healthcare delivery.",
