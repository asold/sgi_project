  "abstract": "Abstract The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in health care has significant implications for patient-clinician interactions. Practical and ethical challenges have emerged with the adoption of large language models (LLMs) that respond to prompts from clinicians, patients, and caregivers. With an emphasis on patient experience, this paper examines the potential of LLMs to act as facilitators, interrupters, or both in patient-clinician relationships. Drawing on our experiences as patient advocates, computer scientists, and physician informaticists working to improve data exchange and patient experience, we examine how LLMs might enhance patient engagement, support triage, and inform clinical decision-making. While affirming LLMs as a tool enabling the rise of the “AI patient,” we also explore concerns surrounding data privacy, algorithmic bias, moral injury, and the erosion of human connection. To help navigate these tensions, we outline a conceptual framework that anticipates the role and impact of LLMs in patient-clinician dynamics and propose key areas for future inquiry. Realizing the potential of LLMs requires careful consideration of which aspects of the patient-clinician relationship must remain distinctly human and why, even when LLMs offer plausible substitutes. This inquiry should draw on ethics and philosophy, aligned with AI imperatives such as patient-centered design and transparency, and shaped through collaboration between technologists, health care providers, and patient communities.",
