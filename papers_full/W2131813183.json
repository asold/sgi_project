From these reports, we know\nmany animals use tools for a variety of functions, and employ tools of differing material char-\nacteristics and with different modes of actions [1, 2]. One form of tool use that has received\nmore scientific attention recently, is the use of percussive stone tools on encased foods by non-\nhuman primates: West African chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus)[ 3–7]; robust capuchins\nSapajus libidinosus[8, 9] andS. xanthosternos [10]; and Burmese long-tailed macaques\n(Macaca fascicularis aurea)[ 11, 12]. These findings have renewed speculation on the relevance\nof stone tools to understanding the origins of technology and culture [13–15].\nThere has been extensive study of variation in the material elements of stone-tool use, that\nare, variations in the types of foods processed with tools, and the tools and anvils used to pro-\ncess them. West African chimpanzees crack oil-palm nuts (Elaeis guineenis), panda nuts\n(Panda oleosa), and coula nuts (Coula edulis), and around Bossou, Guinea, it has been found\nthat neighbouring communities may crack different species of nuts even though all species\nmight be present in either community [16]. Oil-palm nuts are easiest to crack, followed by\ncoula nuts, and panda nuts are the toughest to crack [3]. Related to nut hardness, chimpanzees\nselect different sizes and materials of stones, and different types of anvils to process different\nspecies of nuts [3, 17, 18]. Chimpanzees in Bossou use smaller stones that were either granite,\nquartz, or diorite, to process soft oil-palm nuts, while the chimpanzees of neighbouring Diecké\nuse larger stones, that were almost exclusively granite, on harder panda nuts [17, 19]. Anvils in\nBossou also mostly comprised of loose rocks, while in Diecké, embedded rocks were used as an-\nvils [17]. In the Taï forest, where both stone and wood hammers and anvils were used, chim-\npanzees selected heavier stones for harder panda nuts, and more likely cracked them on rock\nanvils than softer tree-root anvils [3]. In addition, as coula nuts became less hard as the season\nprogressed, some groups of chimpanzees then used wooden club hammers more than stone\nhammers, as the former were more readily available [18].\nSimilar research has also been done on stone-tool-using populations of capuchin monkeys.\nCapuchins at Fazenda Boa Vista most commonly processAstrocarpum campestre, Attala bar-\nreirensis, Orbignya sp. andAttalea sp. palm nuts [20], while those at Fazenda Serra Grande also\nprocessed Attalea, and in addition processedSyagrus palm nuts, the legumes ofHymenaea\nplants, andCnidoscolus nuts [10\n]. These food items differed in weight, shell thickness, and\nstructural complexity, which resulted in differences in the nuts’resistance to cracking [20].\nHammer stones used to crack these nuts varied in weight but averaged above 1kg [10, 21], and\nalso differed in shape, and type of rock, most commonly sandstone or quartzite, which also dif-\nfered in density [21]. At yet another capuchin site, Rio Grande do Norte,Manihot nuts that\nwere not cracked at other sites were also found, and stones used to crack these nuts were found\nto be up to 14 times lighter than other hammer stones [22].\nIn contrast to the detail at which variation in material elements of stone-tool use has been\nstudied, there are comparatively few or no detailed catalogs on behavioural actions employed\nduring stone hammering. One example where researchers have identified variation in tool use\nactions was investigations of grip postures used by wild chimpanzees during nut pounding\nwith stones or wood. Early research reported two types of stone hammering in chimpanzees\n[23]. Chimpanzees at Bossou handled small stones with a“cup grip”, while those in the Ivory\nCoast used a“pestle grip” with one or both hands to manipulate large stone and wooden ham-\nmers. This variation was later expanded, at Ivory Coast, to six different types of power grips\nthat related to the size or material of the tool [24]. In capuchins, some individual variation in\nthe kinematics of striking actions during nut cracking has been identified, such as differences\nin lifting movements, jumping during lifting, and the posturing of the tail during striking [25].\nAction Patterns in Burmese Long-Tailed Macaque Stone-Tool Use\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0124733 May 13, 2015 2/2 5\nIncentive Grant, School of Humanities and Social\nSciences, Nanyang Technological University, and a\nresearch grant for doctoral students from The Leakey\nFoundation. The funders had no role in study design,\ndata collection and analysis, decision to publish, or\npreparation of the manuscript.\nCompeting Interests:The authors have declared\nthat no competing interests exist.\nThe sample size for this study was small (n = 4), but these findings indicate that capuchins\ncould use several variants of action patterns to crack nuts that have yet to be more broadly\nexplored.\nThere are a few examples of detailed study on the elements of behavioural actions within a\nsingle tool-use type. In another form of tool use, the ant-dipping behaviour of chimpanzees\nacross 14 study sites, 2 techniques involving different behavioural actions have been identified\n[26–28]. These are the“pull-through” technique, where chimpanzees dip for ants with one\nhand, then use their other hand to collect the ants from the tools; and the“direct-mouthing”\ntechnique, where chimpanzees use their mouths to directly sweep or nibble ants from tools.\nThe use of these techniques differs across sites [28], and at some sites, is related to the aggres-\nsiveness of ant species [26]. These studies illustrate the importance of recognizing variation in\nbehavioural actions, as it can help us understand the roles of ecological and cultural factors on\nthe formation of tool traditions.\nThe most notable example of a catalog of behavioural actions however, comes from 30-year\nlongitudinal studies of stone handling in Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata), a behaviour re-\nlated to stone-tool use. Researchers have identified 45 different action patterns in how these an-\nimals were handling stones during non-functional play [29]. These detailed discriminations of\nbehavioural patterns helped these researchers to uncover presumed cultural differences in the\ntypes of actions observed between several populations [29], variation across individuals [30],\necological influences on learning [31], and developmental aspects of acquiring the behaviour\n[32, 33].\nIn Burmese long-tailed macaques, work has been done on material variation, which is com-\nparative to some of the work in chimpanzees and capuchins. Variation in the kinds of foods\nthat are processed has been studied, and 47 different food species have been reported [34]. De-\nspite this being the longest list of stone-processed food items by any stone-using primate,\n83.2% of the food material found on the shore is from 4 genera, rock oysters (Saccostrea cucul-\nlata), nerite snails (Nerita spp.), drills (Thais bitubercularis), and tooth-lipped snails (Mono-\ndonto labio). The small amount of remaining food material is from numerous other bivalves,\nmarine gastropods, crustaceans, and shore plant seeds (e.g., sea almonds,Terminalia catappa).\nThis skewed pattern of shell collection towards a heavy use of a few species, while using a range\nof many, resembles the coastal foraging selection of many traditional human societies [35–38],\nwhich is based on foraging for the most easy to acquire types of foods of sufficient size to be\nnourishing [34]. Coastal shellfish differ in whether they are sessile or unattached, and sessile\nmacaque foods are almost exclusively rock oysters. Unattached foods include motile bivalves,\ngastropods and crustaceans, as well as coastal plant seeds. Foods also differ in size, shape, thick-\nness and toughness of shells, as well as their location in the littoral zone, and thus there are\nmany factors that could influence how each food type is collected and processed.\nFrom variation in material elements and behavioural actions of macaque tool use, it has\nbeen inferred that there are two basic hammering forms used by macaques,axe hammering\nand pound hammering. Tool form is identifiable by use-wear, and strongly relates to the kind\nof food being processed. Axe hammers were stone tools that were primarily used for sessile oys-\nters and thus were found in rock oyster beds and most often showed use-wear on their points.\nPound hammers were stone tools that were used for unattached foods and thus were found\namong the debris on anvils and showed use-wear most commonly on the stone’s face [12; 39].\nAxe and pound hammering also appeared to differ across several material and behavioural ele-\nments [12]. Pound hammers were found to be significantly larger, heavier, and harder than axe\nhammers. Furthermore, when pound hammering, macaques typically handled stones with\npower grips (i.e. squeezed between the fingers and the palm) and with one or two hands, while\ntools for axing sessile oysters were held with precision grips (i.e., pinched between the fingers\nAction Patterns in Burmese Long-Tailed Macaque Stone-Tool Use\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0124733 May 13, 2015 3/2 5\nand thumb) and with one hand. Lastly, when axe-hammering, macaques struck targets at a\nfaster rate and directed striking towards a wider range of spatial orientations relative to body\nposition, than when pound hammering.\nAxe and pound hammering are not always fully discriminable, because there is variation\nwithin these two forms of tools use, that can be ambiguous as to whether they can be defined as\naxe hammering or pound hammering. Although the dichotomy works well and covers the ma-\njority of variation in macaque tool use in a broad sense, we can still explore in more detail the\npatterns of macaque tool-use variation. For example, other variations have been noted, that in-\nvolve variation in hand use, postures, and striking actions [12]. However, detailed investigation\nof these variations has not yet been done. Also there are clearly different kinds of tool use, such\nas the use of shells as tools and the use of stones like fulcrums, which involves lifting only one\nend of the tool to strike food targets, while the other side remains on the anvil surface [12].\nThese, and other, tool use action patterns need to be better explored and documented to build\na complete catalog of macaque tool-use actions.\nIn this paper, we present a tested classification system of both material and behavioural vari-\nation. Here, we have created a system to categorize variation in macaque tool use, and defined\na set of hammering classes and tool-use action patterns employed by the Burmese long-tailed\nmacaques of Laem Son National Park, Thailand. After identifying this behavioural variation,\nwe then tested for associations between material and behavioural elements. We then used our\nnew system to assess the usefulness of the previously described axe/pound hammering catego-\nrization of long-tailed macaque stone tools [12]. Finally, we examined the prevalence of each\ntype of variation using behavioural observations. Overall, our goal was to establish a research\ntool for stronger tests of how learning processes, ecological differences, and geographical distri-\nbution affect macaque tool use, allowing better testing of hypotheses on the evolution and de-\nvelopment of traditions in animals than have been possible in other primate models. As new\npopulations of stone-tool-using Burmese long-tailed macaques are continuing to be discovered\nacross Thailand and Myanmar [Gumert et al., in prep], and research on development is under-\nway [Tan et al., in prep], a well-developed classification system of macaque tool-use actions,\nsuch as ours, will allow researchers to more clearly document patterns of variation and change.\nMethods\nResearch and Ethical Permissions\nWe obtained appropriate permissions for our research. Our research was approved by, and in\naccordance with the ethical guidelines of the NTU-Institutional Animal Care & Use Commit-\ntee in Singapore (ref: ARF SBS/NIE-A 0138 NZ; ARF SBS/NIE-A 0058; ARF SBS/NIE 0138\nAZ). Furthermore, the National Research Council of Thailand provided permission to conduct\nresearch in Thailand (Project 2314), and the Department of National Parks, Wildlife, and Plant\nConservation permitted research in Laem Son National Park.\nStudy Site\nWe observed tool-using behaviour and collected video of tool use from two adjacent islands in\nLaem Son National Park, Ranong Province, Thailand, Piak Nam Yai (PNY) Island (9°34’48”N,\n98°28’00’E) and Thao Island (9°34’41”N, 98°28’50”E). Laem Son National Park is a marine na-\ntional park off Thailand’s west coast. The park primarily protects parts of the Andaman Sea,\nbut also contains 15 islands and a small part of the mainland. Burmese long-tailed macaques\ninhabit only two of these islands, PNY and Thao Island. PNY is a small island with an area of\n1.7km\n2 and 5.4km of coastline, situated approximately 750m off the cost of Thailand. Thao Is-\nland has an area of 1.3km2 and 5.3km of coastline. The islands’shores consist of sandy beaches,\nAction Patterns in Burmese Long-Tailed Macaque Stone-Tool Use\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0124733 May 13, 2015 4/2 5\nrocky shores, and mangrove, which contain a wide variety of marine invertebrates and shore\nplants that the macaques process with stone tools and consume daily.\nIdentifying Variation\nSubjects. Our subjects were studied using video that was recorded between 2007–2012,\nfrom which we had 90 subjects, consisting of 31 adult females, 17 adult males, 7 adolescent fe-\nmales, 2 adolescent males, and 33 juveniles whose sexes could not always be discerned from\nvideo. These subjects were a subset of a population of macaques living on PNY and Thao Island\nin LSNP. A survey conducted in 2011 reported that there were approximately 192 macaques\nliving in 9 groups on PNY [40]; however the macaques on Thao Island were not well counted,\nbut were approximated to be around 60–100 animals. Based on these numbers, our sample of\nsubjects represents about a third of the studied population.\n143 of the macaques on PNY were individually identified and named in 2011 [40], which al-\nlowed us to match digital photographs of these named individuals with some of the individuals\nin our video data. However, as most of the video data was collected three to four years before\nthe identification of individuals, not all the macaques in the videos were present in the popula-\ntion in 2011. However, we were able to discriminate these unnamed individuals on video\nby their unique facial characteristics, and thus were able to reliably identify all subjects used in\nthis study.\nCollection of Video. Several researchers, MG, MK, DV, and AT, collected video record-\nings of tool-using behaviour during several research trips to LSNP in 2007, 2008, and 2012,\nand obtained 22 hours of video in total across 21 days (~1hr/day). MG, MK, and DV collected\nvideo in 2007 between December 1\nst— 5th, and in 2008 between February 26th— March 2nd,\nJune 3rd— 23rd, and December 10th— 20th, while AT collected video in 2012 from May 18th-\n23rd. During these trips, researchers circumnavigated PNY and Thao Islands by long-tail boat\nsearching for macaques on the shore. When macaques were located, we stopped the boat and\nobserved them. During some observation periods we recorded instances of tool use with a\nvideo recorder, and these videos were used to score our data.\nWe collected approximately two hours of video using a focal sampling protocol; however,\nmost of our videos were collected without randomized decision rules for sampling. In 2007 and\n2008, individuals were not recognizable and so no standard protocols by individual macaque\ncould be designed. However, effort was made to video as many different animals as possible\nwhen videoing macaques on the shore. During this phase, there were no standardized stopping\nprocedures for ending a video recording. We tried to video tool-use bouts to completion; how-\never boat and sea conditions could disrupt video sequences by motion, causing the target ani-\nmal to go off the recording screen for short periods. In 2012, individual macaques could be\nidentified, and AT collected video according to a focal sampling protocol. Randomized lists\nwith the names of all individuals were generated, and individuals were videoed for 5 minutes\neach time, according to the orders on the lists. If at the end of the 5 minutes the focal subject\nwas in the middle of a tool use bout, we recorded the bout to completion, and the focal was\ncontinued until the subject consumed the food item, or ceased to interact with the food item\nfor more than 10s.\nVideo Scoring of Tool-Use Bouts.All videos collected were scored by AT, with a stan-\ndardized procedure that involved defining discrete tool-use bouts, identifying the tool-using in-\ndividual performing the bout, and scoring the material and behavioural elements of each bout.\nA bout of tool use commenced when the subject began striking a food item. A bout was scored\nas ended when the last strike had been applied to the food item before its consumption, or the\nsubject ceasing any interaction with the food item for more than 10s. For each tool-use bout we\nAction Patterns in Burmese Long-Tailed Macaque Stone-Tool Use\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0124733 May 13, 2015 5/2 5\nscored the identity, group membership, age class and sex of the tool user. We also scored the\ngeneral characteristics of each tool-use bout, which included the duration and number of\nstrikes used. Duration and number of strikes were then used to calculate the strike rate of each\nbout. We scored several material and behavioural elements for each tool use bout (Table 1).\nFor material elements, we examined the tool and food in each tool-use bout and scored the fol-\nlowing, 1) the tool material (i.e., stone or shell), 2) the tool size, which we estimated using a size\nindex based on the size of the tool relative to the macaque’s hand size as they appeared on\nvideo, 3) the tool surface used to strike the food (i.e., point, edge, or face;Fig 1), and 4) the cate-\ngory of food (i.e., sessile or unattached). For behavioural elements, we examined the subject’s\nactions, and scored 1) striking action, 2) strike recoil, 3) tool-hand use, 4) non-tool-hand use,\n5) posture, 6) manner of lifting tool, and 7) direction of striking.\nClassification of Tool-Use Bouts.Every tool-use bout was classified into ahammering\nclass and action pattern(Table 2). Hammering class assignment was determined by identifying\nwhich surface of the tool was used to strike the food target. These were, 1)point hammering,2 )\nedge hammeringand 3)face hammering. If a macaque used an auger shell (Turritella attenuata)\nas a tool, we classified only point or face hammering, due to the shell’s conical shape.\nAll tool-use bouts were further sub-divided into an action pattern within the hammering\nclass. Within each hammering class, we first divided action patterns based on one material ele-\nment, the tool material, and thus were assigned as stone-hammering or shell-hammering ac-\ntion patterns. We then divided action patterns according to hand use, into whether they were\nunimanual, involving only one hand handling the tool, or bimanual, involving both hands han-\ndling the tool. For unimanual action patterns, we then further divided action patterns accord-\ning to whether the non-tool-handling hand performed a supportive function on the substrate\non which food items were attached. For bimanual action patterns, we further divided action\npatterns into symmetrical patterns, where both hands performed the same action in handling\nthe tool, and asymmetrical, where one hand was dominant in lifting and lowering the tool dur-\ning striking and the other hand performed a supportive function on the tool. Lastly, we differ-\nentiated action patterns according to the dynamics of strike actions used, that are, 1) the\nmanner in which the tool was lifted, whether lifted fully or only partially from one end, 2) the\nstrike action used, whether overhand, underhand, a clapping motion, or a flipping of the stone\nat the apex of the strike trajectory and 3) posture while striking, whether the macaque remained\nin a static posture and struck by moving only the arms, or rose to a bipedal posture before each\nstrike to utilize its body to generate strike force. All action patterns were a unique combination\nof these elements.\nAnalysis of Hammering Class Differences.We collated data on tool-bout characteristics,\nmaterial, and behavioural elements of each tool use bout by hammering class, and then tested\nfor differences amongst the hammering classes. For tool-bout characteristics, we tested whether\nthere were differences across hammering class for bout duration, number of strikes and strike\nrate. For material and behavioural elements, we tested whether hammering classes differed on\ntool size, and whether hammering classes were associated with food type, grip type, hand use,\nstrike recoil, posture, and strike direction. For the latter comparisons on associations between\nfood type, grip type, hand use, strike recoil, posture, and strike direction and hammering clas-\nses, we calculated the proportion of tool-use bouts in which there was sessile food type, use of\nprecision grip, use of both hands, smooth recoil, sitting posture, and strike direction towards\ndifferent plane for each individual across all three hammering classes (SeeTable 1for defini-\ntions of these element variables), and tested if these proportions differed between hammering\nclasses. Lastly, we also tested for differences within hammering classes, between bouts per-\nformed on sessile and unattached foods, for classes where use on both food types was common.\nTesting these differences were used for comparing with previous descriptions of axe and pound\nAction Patterns in Burmese Long-Tailed Macaque Stone-Tool Use\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0124733 May 13, 2015 6/2 5\nTable 1.

However,\nwe excluded 23 individuals with fewer than 10 scan samples, leaving a sample of 3077 scans\nfrom 109 individuals for an average of 28 scans per individual, ranging between 10 to 53 scans\nper individual. Our sample was over half of the ~200 animals from Piak Nam Yai at the time of\nstudy [40]. From these scans, we calculated the proportion of individuals ever observed using\ntools during scan samples. For each tool-using individual, we calculated what proportion of\ntotal scans were feeding scans, what proportion of feeding scans were tool-use scans, and what\nproportion of tool-use scans used each hammering class and action pattern. We also calculated\nhow many types of hammering classes and action patterns each individual used during all scans.\nWe used these scans to assess how often each hammering class and action pattern was uti-\nlized, and we performed comparisons across groups. The 109 individuals observed belonged to\ngroups BC, MN, RF, RS and SS [40]. We first calculated for each individual, the proportion of\ntool-use scans in which each hammering class was used. Then, we tested if across groups, the\nproportion of tool-use scans in which individuals’used each hammering class differed, To do\nthis, we used a Welch’s one-way ANOVA to determine if groups differed in the proportion of\ntool-use scans in which each hammering class was used, with Games-Howell post-hoc tests to\nidentify which groups differed from each other in each hammering class.\nResults\nHammering Class and Action Patterns\nFrom the 22 hours of video collected, we investigated tool use bouts and categorized all bouts\ninto hammering classes and action patterns. Our data set included 638 bouts of tool use across\n90 individuals, totaling 45 minutes of tool use. This was an average of about 7 tool-use bouts\nper individual (SD = 8.27), ranging from 1–43 bouts per individual. Tool use bouts ranged be-\ntween 1s to 60s long, at an average of 4.17s per bout (SD = 5.42). All tool-use bouts were cate-\ngorized into one of the three hammering classes (Table 2). We observed 398 bouts of point\nhammering, 147 bouts of face hammering, and 93 bouts of edge hammering. We also identified\n17 action patterns (S1 Video). Five of these action patterns were in the point hammering class,\nnine in the face hammering class, and three in the edge hammering class.\nDifferences across Hammering Class\nWe found significant differences across the hammering classes for all variables tested. Due to\nseveral variables being tested we have organized the results and statistics into tables and figures\n(Table 3and Table 4; Fig 2). We found several significant associations. Point hammering was\nmore associated with sessile foods than edge hammering and face hammering, and edge ham-\nmering was more associated with sessile foods than face hammering. Tools used for face and\nedge hammering were larger than tools used for point hammering. Point hammering bouts\nwere shorter than edge hammering bouts. More strikes were used during point hammering\nthan face hammering bouts. Strike rate was faster for point hammering than for edge and face\nhammering. Point hammering had more smooth recoil of striking than edge and face hammer-\ning. Point hammering was less often bimanual than edge and face hammering. Point and edge\nhammering used precision gripping more than face hammering. In point hammering, striking\nwas directed towards a different plane more than edge and face hammering bout. Face ham-\nmering was more often from a seated posture than point and edge hammering.\nWe compared tool bouts on sessile and unattached foods within each class. However, point\nhammering was not assessed because 97% of bouts were on sessile foods, and thus point\nAction Patterns in Burmese Long-Tailed Macaque Stone-Tool Use\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0124733 May 13, 2015 10 / 25\nhammering was almost entirely performed on sessile foods at LNSP. Edge hammering and face\nhammering did have sufficient cases of sessile and unattached food tool bouts for analysis\n(Face hammering: 21% sessile, 89% unattached; Edge hammering: 55% sessile, 45% unat-\ntached). We found more significant differences of variables determined between hammering\non sessile versus unattached foods for edge hammering than for face hammering (Table 5&\nTable 6; Fig 3). Edge hammering on sessile oysters had smaller tool sizes, faster strike rates, and\na higher proportion of bouts with smooth recoil, precision grip utilization, and striking towards\na different plane than edge hammering on unattached foods. Face hammering on sessile foods\ndiffered from unattached foods only in having a higher proportion of bouts with smooth\nstrike recoil.\nPrevalence of Hammering Class and Action Patterns\nOut of the 109 individuals studied in scan sampling, 87 individuals, or 79.82% of sampled indi-\nviduals were recorded to use tools (85.55% of adults and adolescents, and 46.67% of juveniles).\nWe found that macaques carried or used tools in 22.25% of their scan samples, which was\n48.32% of scans during feeding scan samples. Out of all tool-use scan samples, the proportion\nof face hammering was 50.08%, point hammering was 41.90%, and edge hammering was\n2.41%. Surface use could not be recorded in the remaining 5.61% of tool-use scan samples due\nto issues of visibility. We found that, in total, 54 individuals point hammered, 68 individuals\nface hammered, and 12 individuals edge hammered. 49 individuals were observed in their scan\nTable 4.

In particular, we wanted to develop a systematic ethogram of macaque tool-use action pat-\nterns that could facilitate future study. We categorized macaque stone-tool use by hammering\nclass, which was based on the surface of the tool that was used to strike food items, these being\npoint hammering, face hammering, and edge hammering. Furthermore, we were able to discretely\nidentify 17 action patterns within these hammering classes based on different patterns of elements.\nT h ec o m m o na c t i o np a t t e r n sw e r eunimanual point hammering(58%), symmetrical bimanual\nface hammering(43%), andunimanual face hammering(37%). Edge hammering(13%) was less\ncommon than point and face hammering. However,unimanual edge hammeringwas not as rare\nas other action patterns, which were all used by 5% or less of the population. In addition, one ac-\ntion pattern, bimanual jab point hammering, has only ever been observed in one individual.\nAction patterns were distinguishable by the unique combinations of material and beha-\nvioural elements that comprised them. The only material element that was used to discriminate\naction patterns was whether a stone or shell was used as a tool, as the other material elements,\nsize of stone and food type could potentially vary in all of the action patterns. Furthermore, we\nwanted to leave open the ability to test how behavioural actions relate to these material ele-\nments, as we acquire more data in the future. As a result, our classification system is primarily\na differentiation across behavioural elements, hence why we refer to them as action patterns.\nA Re-Assessment of Axe and Pound Hammering\nPrevious research had described two basic forms of stone pounding in Burmese long-tailed ma-\ncaques [12]. These were,“axe hammering”, which was predominantly hammering to crack\nTable 7.

Furthermore, axe hammering was de-\nscribed as a form of hammering most often using the tool’s points, having a faster strike rate,\nusing a precision grip, having a wider range of motion, having smooth strike recoil, and using a\nvariety of postures. In contrast, pound hammering was described as a form of hammering\nmost often using the face, always starting from a seated posture, having a slower strike rate,\nusing a power grip, not usually having smooth strike recoil, and always being performed to-\nward the horizontal plane the animal is seated on and from a seated posture [12]. In this cur-\nrent study, we differentiated patterns of tools in greater detail, and tried to assess the utility of\nthe simple dichotomous discrimination of axe and pound hammering. To do this, we per-\nformed an analysis across hammering classes to test how each class related to food type, tool\nsize, bout duration, number of strikes in a bout, strike rate, strike recoil, hand use, grip type, di-\nrection of striking, and posture. We then compared our findings to the descriptions of axe and\npound hammering used formerly.\nOur current analysis of hammering classes was mostly consistent with prior descriptions.\nAxe and pound hammering most clearly related to our classes of point and face pounding\nFig 4. Scan sampling indicated differences in the proportion of point, face, or edge hammering used\nacross five groups.Letters are used to denote statistical significance. Each letter groups bars into non-\nsignificant groups within each analysis, and thus significantly different bars do not share letters. Error bars\nrepresent one standard error of the mean.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0124733.g004\nAction Patterns in Burmese Long-Tailed Macaque Stone-Tool Use\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0124733 May 13, 2015 16 / 25\nrespectively. Furthermore, we found that face and point hammering significantly differed in all\nelements, except bout duration. In addition, they varied in the ways described previously. That\nis, point hammering was almost always used for sessile foods, and showed the features that had\nbeen described for axe hammering, while face hammering was mostly used for unattached\nfood, and showed features described in pound hammering. More problematic though was the\nedge hammering class, because edge hammering was regularly observed for both processing\nsessile and unattached food, and thus edge hammering could be used interchangeably as both\naxe and pound hammering.\nTo account for this, we compared edge hammering of sessile foods with that on unattached\nfoods. We performed a similar analysis on face hammering as well, since face hammering also\nhad cases on both sessile and unattached foods. We found that edge hammering on sessile\nfoods strongly resembled axe hammering in its features, while edge hammering on unattached\nfoods resembled pound hammering. In contrast, we did not find that face hammering of\nsessile foods resembled axe hammering, other than that smooth recoil was significantly more\nfrequent. This shows that food type alone is not driving the axe hammering-pound hammering\ndistinction. Rather sessile foods produce the axing form when the edges or points are used,\nwhile face hammering always resembles the pounding form of tool use, regardless of food type.\nPrevious research discussed difference in the“precision” of use of axe and pound hammering,\narguing that axe hammering was a more precise form of tool use compared to pound hammer-\ning [12]. Hammering of any food item with the face, or an unattached food source with the\nedge is a less precise form of hammering, because it does not require a specific point of the tool\nto strike a specific area on a rock. There is also less specificity of where on the edge or face the\nstone must hit the food item as these surface areas are larger, and furthermore, the macaques\ncan manipulate an unattached food item to a convenient location on an anvil. Axe hammering\ndiffers because when chipping oysters with the edge or point of a tool, a small region of the\nstone must strike at a non-manipulable target attached to a rock. Substrates on which sessile\noysters are attached to can be oriented at many different angles, for example, an overhanging\nrock, requiring the axe hammering macaque to alter its strike angle according while maintain-\ning accuracy. From such action, a more precise form of tool use results, called axe hammering,\nwhich has not been documented in any other non-human primate.\nAcross hammering classes we found significant differences in the size of tool used. Size is a\nmaterial element that has been discussed to differ between axe and pound hammering, and in-\ndeed tool size does relate to sessile and unattached foods. Our results showed that macaques,\non average, used larger tools for face and edge hammering than point hammering. The aver-\nages do not reflect all use though, and smaller tools were regularly used for unimanual action\npatterns of face and edge hammering, and thus what we can conclude is that during unimanual\ntool use, macaques are using small hand-sized tools regardless of the surface being used. How-\never, face and edge hammering more often involved the use of both hands for tool handling\ncompared to point hammering, and thus stones were on average larger in the face and edge\nhammering classes. Exceptional cases were bimanual point pounding and bimanual jab ham-\nmering action pattern, which were always carried out with large or extra large tools held with\nboth hands. This further supports that tool size and hand use were strongly related during our\nstudy. In addition, this shows that when discriminating axe hammering and pound hammering\nthe size of the stone was not the critical component, as the bimanual forms of point hammering\nwith a large stone resembled all other features of axe hammering, while unimanual pounding\nwith small stones still resembled the features of pound hammering.\nGripping significantly differed across the hammering classes. Macaques used power grips to\nhandle tools in a significantly larger proportion of face hammering, than both edge and point\nhammering. Precision gripping was largely associated with sessile foods, as when edge\nAction Patterns in Burmese Long-Tailed Macaque Stone-Tool Use\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0124733 May 13, 2015 17 / 25\nhammering broken into sessile and unattached components, precision grips were used signifi-\ncantly more often with sessile foods than with unattached. Moreover, point hammering, which\nis primary performed on sessile foods, was predominantly performed with a precision grip. An\nexception to this was shell point hammering with auger shells (Turritella attenuata), which are\nhandled with a vertical squeeze power grip. This grip relates to the conical shape of the tool,\nand is performed in a motion and grip similar to overhand stabbing. In this study, all shell\ntools observed were auger shells. However, other shells such as dog and crown conches (Laevis-\ntrombus canariumand Pugilina cochlidium) or tun shells (Tonnidae— probably Tonna sp.)\nhave also been observed used as tools and are shaped much differently and more like a stone.\nWe do not have any data on the usage patterns of these much more rare types of shell tools.\nSome of the features of striking significantly varied across the classes, and also were mostly\ncomparative with the previous axe and pound-hammering dichotomy. Strike rates were signifi-\ncantly faster during point hammering than both face and edge hammering. The recoil of the\narm following a strike was significantly more often smoothly returned to starting point, rather\nthan involving fumbling or repositioning of the tool, during point hammering than face and\nedge hammering. Furthermore, during point hammering, striking was significantly more often\ndirected towards targets at differing spatial orientations from the plane on which the animal\nwas positioned, unlike face hammering strikes, which were almost exclusively targeted hori-\nzontally below the user. Lastly, macaques carried out tool use from a seated posture significant-\nly more often during face hammering, than point hammering. During point hammering, we\nregularly observed macaques standing when point hammering, in order to reach where the ses-\nsile target was located. For face hammering, we observed macaques standing bipedally to per-\nform stand face hammering. However, the macaque would always rise from an initially seated\nposture before standing bipedally, and then return to a seated position following the strike.\nVariation across Groups\nIn our study we found that each group varied in the frequency of different hammering classes\nobserved. It is this type of variation we seek to explore by using a behavioural catalog of classes\nand action patterns, and thus we provide preliminary evidence that defining variation of ma-\ncaque tool use in this way could lead to understanding spatial and temporal changes in its\nusage. Across the groups of PNY, we found some evidence that habitat may have affected the\ndistribution of differing hammering classes, which was due to the availability of prey in each\nhabitat. Groups that ranged predominantly within mangrove habitats used a higher proportion\nof point pounding than face pounding action patterns in their scan samples. The reverse was\ntrue for individuals in groups whose coastal ranges consisted mainly of rocky shore habitats.\nOysters made up a larger proportion of foods processed in mangrove habitats, while some\ncommon unattached food types like nerite and tooth-lipped snails were more common on\nrocky shore habitats than in the mangroves [34]. Since point pounding is strongly associated\nwith sessile foods, it is congruent with habitat to see more of that class of hammering in man-\ngrove habitats, and likewise, more face hammering on the rocky shore. This suggests an influ-\nence of ecology on behavioural patterns of stone tool use in Burmese long-tailed macaques.\nExamples of Using a Catalog of Variation\nDetailed investigations into the behavioural action patterns within single types of animal tool\nuse are not abundant in the literature. This could be due to an actual lack of sufficient variation\nin action patterns, or that the variation is there but researchers have focused on only a few vari-\nants while ignoring others. There have been broader studies on variation in the presence and\nabsence of different types of behaviours across populations. These studies have allowed the\nAction Patterns in Burmese Long-Tailed Macaque Stone-Tool Use\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0124733 May 13, 2015 18 / 25\ndiscovery of behavioural traditions by identifying the prevalence of different behaviours across\npopulations that are not clearly the result of ecological differences, and are therefore more like-\nly transmitted via social learning processes [42]. Well-known examples are the documentation\nof inter-population differences across chimpanzee communities [27] and orangutan popula-\ntions [43, 44], where a variety of cultural behaviours, including tool use and non-foraging-\nrelated behaviours, have been identified based on their presence in some communities and ab-\nsence in others. In capuchins, it has also been found that groups ofS. libidinosus inhabiting\nSerra da Capivara have more complex tool kits than groups of capuchins in other locations\nsuch as Boa Vista and Tietê Ecological Park [45]. These studies could benefit further from\nmore detailed investigations into more specific aspects of behavioural variation within each\ntype of tool use or behaviour, to better understand how various ecological and social factors\nshape traditional behaviours in different populations. Furthermore, in species that may not ex-\nhibit such a wide variety of different behaviours, this approach to identifying traditions through\nbehavioural differences can only work if behavioural variants within a single type of behaviour\nare well documented, and this is where a catalog such as ours will come in very useful.\nIn our study, we have tried to develop a comprehensive list of variation in actions that ma-\ncaques use during stone tool use, which in many ways is complementary to studies on the beha-\nvioural patterns of stone handling in Japanese macaques [46]. The cataloging of variation in\naction patterns of Japanese macaque stone handling [29] was a foundational step in their work,\nand provided the basis for an“inter-populational comparative approach”, developmental stud-\nies, ecological influences on behaviour, and individual differences [46]. Using their catalog, re-\nsearchers studied variation from their catalog in 10 populations around Japan, and found that\nbehavioural patterns, or stone-handling action patterns, were patchy in their distribution sug-\ngesting local stone-handling traditions [29]. There was greater similarity in geographically closer\npopulations of Japanese macaques, and this was concluded to show cultural zones of these local\nstone handing traditions. They also were able to look at developmental patterns [33], and found\nthat offspring do not necessarily perform the same behavioural patterns that their mothers do.\nThey argue this was because adult forms of handling were more complex, and that individual\nlearning process played a large role in forming an individual’s stone-handling repertoire.\nCurrently, we are investigating the distribution of macaque tool use across the Andaman\nSea coast in Thailand and Myanmar, and the Thai Gulf coast (Gumert et al., in prep). As we\nuncover more islands and areas where long-tailed macaques exhibit stone tool use, we will be\nable to conduct similar cross-population comparisons as have been done in the stone-handling\nJapanese macaques, and cultural traditions in chimpanzees, orangutans, and capuchins. Our\ncategorization system developed in this study provides the basis for making refined discrimina-\ntions across populations to detect subtle differences in local behavioural traditions, and identi-\nfying such variation in the structure of action patterns across populations will allow us to test\nhow ecological and cultural factors contribute to such variation. We will be able to use the cata-\nlog developed in this paper to determine which action patterns are present in each new popula-\ntion discovered, whether there are differences in how each action pattern is in each population,\nand whether there are new action patterns in the stone-tool-use repertoire of other populations\nthat have not been observed in LSNP.\nWe have also begun study on the development of stone-tool-use skills a population of tool-\nusing macaques on Koram Island, which is off the Thai Gulf coast in Khao Sam Roi Yot Na-\ntional Park, Prachuap Khiri Khan Province, Thailand (Tan et al. in prep). We have been using\nthis catalog of tool-use action patterns to score tool-use bouts in a study to better understand\nthe effects of social networks on development. Using this technique we will be able to assess\nwhether young macaques develop the same action patterns that are used most commonly by\ntheir mothers and other skilled individuals with whom they are most closely affiliated. We will\nAction Patterns in Burmese Long-Tailed Macaque Stone-Tool Use\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0124733 May 13, 2015 19 / 25\nalso be able to investigate if closely affiliated individuals share the same action patterns for pro-\ncessing the same food items. This is similar to a study done on capuchins, which showed that\nindividuals that spent more time in proximity to each other were more likely to share similar\nfood processing techniques than less closely affiliated group members [47]. This has also been\ndone with Japanese macaques, where researchers found the young macaques did not acquire\nthe same stone handling patterns as their mothers [33]. By documenting the acquisition\nof tool use and its various action patterns we will be able to better assess the influences of\nenvironment, social learning, and individual trial-and-error learning processes on tool-use\ndevelopment.\nComparison with Japanese Macaque Stone-Handling and Other Stone-\nTool-Users\nIt will be of high interest to look for homology in the action patterns of stone-handling ma-\ncaques and stone tool-using macaques, and what these might suggest about how stone-tool use\ncame about in the macaque lineage. For example, thePound on Surface[29] is essentially\nPound Hammering, without pounding any food, but sometimes pounding other stones. The\nstone-handling patternClack [29] is similar to ourClap Face Poundingtool-use action pattern,\nagain, except it is two stones that are hit rather than a stone and a food item. Japanese ma-\ncaques alsoFlip stones [29]. A flipping action is an element ofFlip Face Hammeringin our list\nof action patterns. The extensive work on stone handling in Japanese macaques, and lesser\nwork on other stone-handling species such as common long-tailed macaques (M. f. fascicularis)\n[48], Taiwanese macaques (M. cyclopis)[ 49] and rhesus macaques (M. mulatta) [49, 50] sug-\ngest basic manipulation of stones is a general propensity in theFascicularis-species group of\nmacaques [48–50], and perhaps this manipulative ability is the basis for Burmese long-tailed\nmacaques becoming tool-users. However, macaque stone-handling is non-functional and has\nbeen only observed in provisioned macaques [51], whereas stone tool use is functional and is\nthe only stone-using behaviour ever reported in wild, unprovisioned macaque monkeys. This\nsuggests some very unique circumstances are required to elicit stone-use in free-ranging and\nwild macaques.\nWe can question what the basis is for macaques beginning to include stone use into their\nbehavioural repertoires under these conditions, which probably represent novel conditions—\ne.g., a shift to human environment for stone handling, and a shift to coastal and small island\nhabitats with rocky coasts for stone-tool using. It has been suggested that stone handling may\nbe a response to un-satiated food manipulation because feeding is disrupted by the rapid deple-\ntion of the provisioned food [51]. Essentially, food is consumed much faster than it would be\nunder wild conditions, and thus hunger is satiated more quickly leaving more time for non-\nfunctional explorative play behaviour during feeding time.\nOn the other hand, the Burmese long-tailed macaques are foraging on shores and man-\ngroves, where there are numerous rocks and encased foods, and no provisioning. How they\nstarted including stones into their feeding behaviour is unknown, but if we take what is known\nabout stone handling behaviour we could surmise that stone use may have emerged through a\nsimilar behavioural mechanism. When a macaque tries to process an encased food item with-\nout tools, it can often times be a long, and frustrating process, that involves frantically manipu-\nlating the object and things around it. We can consider this a disruption to their usual feeding\nactivity caused by an inability to easily open and consume encased food items. This disruption\nchannels the macaque into a greater range of manipulative and explorative behaviours directed\ntowards the food and nearby items. Gumert (personal observation) has observed long-tailed\nmacaques trying to open encased food, both shellfish and coconuts, without tools, and\nAction Patterns in Burmese Long-Tailed Macaque Stone-Tool Use\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0124733 May 13, 2015 20 / 25\nsometimes these episodes can last tens of minutes with many manipulative actions being per-\nformed on the item. These episodes often contain frantic manipulative behaviours expressed\ntowards the encased foods, which can be extended to surrounding items, such as leaves, sticks,\nand stones (Tan, personal observation). These combinatory manipulations may have then led\nto the opening of foods with stones. However, these are ad lib observations and further study\nneeds to be performed on these rare events to potentially understand how a macaque can de-\nvelop from opening encased foods by manipulation and direct percussion, to opening them\nwith stone tools.\nComparing the action patterns of long-tailed macaque stone-tool use to similar behaviour\nin chimpanzees and capuchins is less straightforward because there are no extensive catalogs of\nbehavioural variation in the pounding patterns of these species. This creates the immediate as-\nsumption, and potentially an illusion, that chimpanzee and capuchin stone tool use is very ho-\nmogenous, and lacks significant behavioural variation in terms of action patterns. General\ndescriptions of tool use in chimpanzees report that they crack nuts placed on anvils from a\nseated posture, striking with hand-sized stone or wooden hammer usually by swinging one\narm, or less frequently, with both hands [52]. On the other hand, the prototypical description\nfor capuchins cracking nuts with stones is that the stones are much larger relative to their body\nsize than are chimpanzees, and they strike by rising from a seated to a bipedal posture, lifting\nthe stone with both hands to shoulder level or higher before smashing it onto the nut [25]. Ma-\ncaques perform action patterns similar to both of these forms of tool use, and we would call the\nchimpanzee description unimanual and bimanual face hammering, and the capuchin descrip-\ntion bimanual stand face hammering.\nResearchers of chimpanzee and capuchin tool use have reported that detailed documenta-\ntion on the variation of stone hammering action patterns has not been carried out (Biro, Fra-\ngaszy and Visalberghi, personal communications). However, in capuchins at least, researchers\nexpress that individuals may vary in their“style” of tool use, such as jumping forward, and lift-\ning tools to different heights, which may indicate different action patterns that have not been\nformally documented (Fragaszy and Visalberghi, personal communications). One study on ca-\npuchins illustrates that the prototypical stand pounding of capuchins is certainly not the only\nform of stone tool use they employ, and indeed may have a range of stone actions that seem re-\nlated to the food and size of stone [22]. Regardless, until more detailed reports appear about\nthe behavioural patterns of chimpanzee and capuchin stone-use, any complete comparisons\nwith macaques on behavioural variation would be premature. However, if we do take the free-\ndom to make a cursory comparison, with the limited information available, we would suggest\nthat macaques, capuchin, and chimpanzees all perform some forms of pound hammering,\nwhile only macaques perform axe hammering. The simplest explanation for this difference is\nthe sessile oysters that macaques are processing. However, we must note one anecdotal report\non capuchins hammering oyster shells with other oyster shells [53], but descriptions of the be-\nhaviour are not clear enough to make any comparisons to our study on hammering classes and\naction patterns. Moreover, no reports of stone tools to process oysters have been put forth. An-\nother factor to consider is the precision gripping capability of macaques, compared to capu-\nchins and chimpanzees [54]. We eagerly await more detailed descriptions on the behavioural\ncatalogs of chimpanzee and capuchins stone use, which would allow more robust comparison\nacross species.\nRelevance to Primate Archaeology\nWork has been done on how different types of macaque stone-tool usage leave different use-\nwear patterns on macaque tools. Such scarring, or use-wear, on stones has been used to\nAction Patterns in Burmese Long-Tailed Macaque Stone-Tool Use\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0124733 May 13, 2015 21 / 25\ndiscriminate axe and pounding hammering [12], and has been tested to be a reliable marker of\npast behavioural use [39]. Investigation of the stones relates to the emerging field of primate ar-\nchaeology, which studies the evolution of lithic technology by comparing stone use across pri-\nmates, looking into the histories of non-human stone tools, and comparing human and non-\nhuman primate lithics [19, 13, 55–59]. The ethogram of classes and action patterns we have\ngenerated here might be able to further contribute to researchers studying the features of use-\nwear in macaque stone tools. We suspect that different actions might damage stones in differ-\nent ways. Indeed, the classes are easy to discriminate because use-wear appears on the surface\nbeing struck, and has already been used as a basis for categorizing use-wear patterns [12, 39].\nExpanding on this would be to study if the different action patterns also produce unique wear\npatterns that could then allow us to reconstruct in greater detail the behavioural histories of\nstones used as tools that have been recovered from macaque sites.\nConclusion\nWe have systematically identified categories of variation in macaque stone-tool-use at LSNP.\nAt this site, macaque tool use consisted of three hammering classes based on whether the tool’s\nface, edge, or point was used, and 17 action patterns based on tool material, hand use, postural\ndifferences, and striking motions. We performed analyses on hammering class across several\nmaterial and behavioural elements, which showed distinguishable differences across the classes.\nThese findings supported earlier descriptions of axe and pound hammering, and we confirmed\nthat point hammering and face hammering patterns fit earlier descriptions of axe and pound\nhammering respectively. However, we found that all edge hammering action patterns were in-\nterchangeable between axe and pound hammering, depending on whether the food source was\nsessile or unattached. We found differences between groups in the prevalence of hammering\nclasses, which showed that inter-group variation is detectable using our catalog and could be\nused for comparative investigations. Our work relates to a similar catalog of actions patterns\ndeveloped to describe stone handling patterns in Japanese macaques, however, such detailed\ncatalogs of behavioural action have not yet been reported for other stone-using primates. De-\nveloping catalogs of behavioural action for stone-use behaviour, such as ours, will help contrib-\nute to future research comparing populations, documenting development, and investigating\nuse-wear patterns.\nSupporting Information\nS1 Video.
