Studying tool use in animals\nprovides insight into the social, ecological, and evolutionary\ncontexts in which it arises [6]. In mammals and birds, tool use\npositively correlates with brain size, social transmission, and\ninnovation [7] and is considered to be a sign of cognitive capacity,\ni.e., problem solving ([8,9] but see [10,11]). Most animal tools are\nused during foraging, especially extractive foraging [1,12]. In\nShark Bay, Western Australia some bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops\nsp.) use marine basket sponge tools to protect their rostra during\nforaging [13–16]. Thus far, we know that sponge foraging,\nhereafter sponging, is primarily a female behavior, appears to be\nvertically socially transmitted [14], and is limited to 54 animals\n(hereafter the spongers) in the eastern gulf of Shark Bay [14]. This\nsolitary behavior occurs in deep channels, requires long dives, and\nconsumes the majority of spongers’ activity budgets, yet does not\nappear to have any fitness costs [14].\nOn several occasions, during exceptional visibility, researchers\nhave directly observed dolphinswearing marine sponges they have\nremoved from the substrate (Figure 1A) over their rostra\n(Figure 1B) as they probe the rough seafloor (Figure 1C) while\nsearching for hidden prey (Figure 1D). Once prey have been\nextracted, dolphins drop their sponges, occasionally surface for a\nquick breath, chase and consume their prey, and finally, return to\npick up their sponges and continue foraging [13,14]. Spongers are\nsuspected to target one or few benthic prey species, including the\nbarred sandperch, Parapercis nebulosa, previously mis-identified as\nParapercis clathrata [14], whose confamilials are consumed by\nbottlenose dolphins elsewhere [17]. The sponge is thought to\nfunction as a shield by providing protection from the sharp and\nrough seafloor, and possibly venomous or spiny benthic marine\norganisms, while dolphins search for and extract prey [13,14].\nDolphins use a single sponge for an average of 68 647 (SD)\nminutes (Max = 4.4 hrs, Min = 3 minutes, N = 125 sponging\nbouts) before dropping it to search for a replacement presumably\nbecause the sponge has lost its protective value. However,why\ndolphins continuously probe the substrate when searching for prey\nis unclear given that at other locations (e.g. crater feeding in the\nBahamas [12]) dolphins detect buried prey indirectly via\necholocation and minimize contact with the seafloor until prey\nare located. In fact, delphinids’ target detection ability using\necholocation is quite impressive [18,19] and has long been used by\nthe U.S. Navy to locate buried mines [20]. So in contrast to other\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 July 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 7 | e22243\nextractive tool users [12], dolphins appear to have the anatomical\nmachinery necessary for the task at hand leaving one to consider:\nWhy do Shark Bay dolphins probe or skim the substrate with their\nrostra and risk injury instead of simply echolocating for prey?\nIt is well known that the major acoustic backscatter of fishes\n(over 90%) comes from the gas-filled swimbladder [21–30]. This\nis not surprising as sound waves most readily echo when\nencountering a difference in medium density (i.e. liquid to gas)\n[31]. Fishes without swimbladders have relatively weak acoustic\nsignals, as fish flesh has an acoustic impedance only 10% greater\nthan water [29]. Many fish species have lost their swimbladders,\npresumably as an adaptation to their benthic or deep-sea lifestyle\n[32]. While some odontocetes are capable of echolocating\nswimbladderless prey (cephalopod detection by Globicephala ,\nZiphiidae, and Physeteridae [33,34]), the majority of these\ncetaceans’ prey are free swimming, not buried [35], and\necholocation in these cephalopod specialists appears to be\nmodified by longer click intervals and higher source levels when\ncompared to bottlenose dolphins [36]. We hypothesized that\nspongers probe the substrate because they target prey that lack\nswimbladders and thus are difficult to detect with echolocation.\nMoreover, when these prey are at least partially buried beneath\na debris-laden substrate, which causes interfering reverberation\nand echo clutter (echoes from objects other than the targeted\nprey) [37], the effectiveness of echolocation is reduced even\nfurther. In contrast, dolphins that crater-feed in the Bahamas\n[38] appear to target buried prey with swimbladders [39] in an\nuncluttered, soft sand substrate that is less likely to injure\ndolphins’ rostra or dramatically interfere with echolocation [40].\nWhile some echolocation has been documented during sponging,\nit may only be useful once prey have been extracted and\ndolphins have dropped their sponges since the sponge itself is\nlikely to interfere with echolocation by obstructing the sound\nreceiving lower jaw and the sound emitting melon [41]. Thus, we\npredicted that the majority of prey that spongers encounter lack\nswimbladders.\nResults\nOf the 134 prey extracted during 13.3 hours of human\nSponging (Video S1) on both transect and verification dives\n(Figure 2), 78% lacked swimbladders (Table 1). In contrast only\n19% of prey from all Non-Sponging dives lacked swimbladders\n(Table 1). Barred sandperch (Figure 1D), which lack swimblad-\nFigure 1.

Purple tuskfish (Choerodon cephalotes ),\nwhich possess swimbladders, were second in abundance during\nboth Sponging and Non-Sponging at 17% and 27% respectively;\nhowever, 74% of purple tuskfish extracted duringSponging were\nfrom locations where less sponging has been documented\n(verification dives, Figure 2), and this species was only extracted\nwhen divers probed small seagrass tufts which are both\nuncharacteristic of channel habitat and less likely to harm\ndolphins’ rostra. Striped whiptail (Pentapodus vitta), which possess\nswimbladders, were the predominant prey duringNon-Sponging at\n34%, but not extracted at all during Sponging. No additional\nfamilies were extracted during Sponging on verification dives,\nalthough verification dives did yield 3 additional Non-Sponging\nfamilies (Table 1), indicating that our transects are representative\nof spongers’ prey, but not of all non-burrowing prey in the\neastern gulf of Shark Bay, which is not surprising.\nThe ratio of prey without swimbladders to those with\nswimbladders was significantly higher duringSponging compared\nto Non-Sponging on video transects (Figure 3, Wilcoxon signed-\nrank test W = 28, P = 0.016), demonstrating that dolphins\nencounter a greater proportion of swimbladderless prey when\nsponging than is available to them without disturbing the\nsubstrate. Furthermore, the abundance of prey extracted during\nSponging on transects was significantly greater than that for the\nsame prey families during Non-Sponging on transects (Figure 4,\nWilcoxon signed-rank test W = 28, P = 0.016), indicating that\nthese prey are primarily concealed in the substrate and that\nsponging is an effective method of extraction. Together these\nresults show that sponging dolphins extract concealed swimblad-\nderless prey, and do so with greater efficiency than could be done\nwithout a sponge tool. Finally, a permutation test revealed that\nthe number of prey families extracted duringSponging that lack\nswimbladders was significantly greater than expected when\ncompared to 27 years of data from the Shark Bay Dolphin\nResearch Project’s long-term study (P = 0.0132, Table S1),\nsuggesting that sponging is the primary way dolphins access\nswimbladderless prey.\nTable 1.Prey abundance fromSponging and Non-Sponging, pooled from both transects and verification dives.\nCommon Name Family Species (if known) Sponging Abundance Non-Sponging Abundance Swimbladder\nbarred sandperch Pinguipedidae Parapercis nebulosa 87 15 N [53]*\nsand lizardfish Synodontidae Synodus dermatogenys 90 N [52]*\ncuttlefishes Sepiidae 5 0 N +\nstingrays Dasyatidae 1 1 N +\nlefteye flounders Bothidae 1 0 N [32]*\npainted maskray Dasyatidae Neotrygon leylandi 10 N +\ntasselsnout flathead Platycephalidae Thysanophrys cirronasa 10 N [52]*\npurple tuskfish Labridae Choerodon cephalotes 23 23 Y [52,54]*\nfreckled goatfish Mullidae Upeneus tragula 40 Y [52]\nwrasses Labridae 2 0 Y [52,54]*\nstriped whiptail Nemipteridae Pentapodus vitta 02 9 Y *\nmargined coralfish Chaetodontidae Chelmon marginalis 06 Y [52]#\nblackspot tuskfish Labridae Choerodon schoenleinii 05 Y [52,54]*\nbluntheaded wrasse Labridae Thalassoma amblycephalum 02 Y [52,54]*\nhumpback batfish Ephippidae Platax batavianus 02 Y [52]#\nyellowtail clownfish Pomacentridae Amphiprion clarkii 01 Y [52]#\npuffers Tetraodontidae 0 1 Y [62]*\nNumbers represent reference(s) used to determine swimbladder status.\n*Dissected in this study,+Swimbladder well known to be absent in entire family,\n#Additional family encountered on verification dives.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0022243.t001\nFigure 3.

Fish are comprised primarily of water (fish\nflesh: 82% water, 17% protein, and 0.35% fat by weight [42]) so the\ndensity of fish (less the swimbladder) is only slightly greater than\nseawater (1.076 compared to 1.026 g/cm\n3 [43]). As such,\nswimbladderless prey have little acoustic impedance and are\ndifficult to detect with echolocation [21–30]. To make matters\nmore difficult, Shark Bay channels are strewn with fragmented rock,\nshell, and coral that are not only likely to injure dolphins’ rostra, but\nalso create an echo-cluttering environment leaving dolphins\n‘acoustically blind’ to swimbladderless prey. Similarly, echolocating\nbats seem to have trouble detecting prey on the surface of ponds that\nare covered with duckweed [44]. Our data demonstrate that\nspongers have developed a way of effectively extracting hidden prey\nby probing the substrate with protective sponge tools. Furthermore,\nwhen compared to the rest of the Shark Bay population, sponging\ndolphins appear to specialize in prey that lack swimbladders\nallowing them to occupy an empty ecological niche.\nAlternatively, it is possible that dolphins could listen for\nsoniferous benthic prey and simply use sponges for extraction. In\nfact, several species of echolocating bats passively listen for prey-\ngenerated sounds to detect insects in highly cluttered environments\n[45]. However, we believe this is unlikely for Shark Bay dolphins\nsince only two prey families that were infrequently extracted\nduring human Sponging are reported to be soniferous [46], and\nboth possess swimbladders making them detectable with echolo-\ncation anyway. The remaining swimbladderless prey are unlikely\nto be soniferous since the primary sonic mechanism in fishes is\nswimbladder movement [46]. Furthermore, fishes mainly produce\nsound for intraspecific communication [46], not while hidden or\nburied in the substrate as observed in this study.\nThe predominant prey extracted during humanSponging was the\nbarred sandperch whose behavior was strikingly consistent with\ndolphin sponging behavior [14]. When barred sandperch were\ndisturbed during human Sponging, they swam a few meters away\nand returned to the substrate often without reburying. This would\ngive dolphins time to drop their sponges and quickly surface to\nbreathe before diving back down in pursuit, as has been regularly\ndocumented during our long-term study [14]. New photographs\nfrom 2010 of a sponger consuming a small red and brown fish\nprovided further evidence that spongers prey on barred sandperch.\nSponging dolphins may gain several benefits from targeting these\nprey. First, barred sandperch exhibit consistent, predictable behavior\nenabling dolphins to employ a single stereotypic sponging behavior. If\ndolphins extracted a variety of prey species, all having different anti-\npredator tactics, a uniform sponging behavior would not be as\neffective. Second, similar to some foods extracted by primate tool\nusers [12], barred sandperch are reliable and can easily and\nfrequently be extracted with a sponge, one every nine minutes\nduring human Sponging. However, the average barred sandperch\ncollected was small, only 12.664.7 (SD) cm in length (Max = 23 cm,\nM i n = 6c m ,N = 2 1 ) ,w h i c hm a ye x p l a i nw h ys p o n g e r sa r em o r e\nspecialized and dedicate more time to foraging than other dolphins in\nShark Bay [14]. Finally, extracted foods are often high energy,\npremium foods [12]. Since fishes with decreased swimbladder\nvolumes typically have increased lipid content [27], the barred\nsandperch may provide sponging dolphins with an energy-rich meal,\nsimilar to some insect larvae extracted by tool-using birds [47].\nAccordingly, several barred sandperch have been stored for\nnutritional analysis. Thus, while requiring more effort than free-\nswimming prey, barred sandperch likely provide these tool users with\na small, yet predictable, reliable, and possibly energy rich food source.\nThis highly specific tool use has implications for cognition and\nbrain evolution among cetaceans and could even be considered a\ncase of problem solving, a phenomenon difficult to document in\nthe wild, but well established in studies of captive bottlenose\ndolphins [48]. Our study demonstrates how bottlenose dolphins\nmight use these skills in their natural environment and provides\ninsight into the ecological and evolutionary pressures that promote\nhigher-level cognition. Spongers may have solved the problem of\ndetecting and extracting swimbladderless prey from below a sharp\nand rough substrate by probing the seafloor with a soft sponge\ntool. This solution appears to have been adopted at least twice, as\nunrelated dolphins residing 110 km away in the western gulf of\nShark Bay also sponge forage [15]. While this tool use requires\nsophisticated object manipulation, it appears to provide spongers\nwith equal fitness compared to the rest the population [14].\nDue to the difficulty of observing marine fauna, most studies of tool\nuse focus on terrestrial organisms. Using novel underwater tech-\nniques, we show that sponge tool-using dolphins target buried prey\nthat lack swimbladders, particularly barred sandperch. Such prey are\ndifficult to detect with echolocation [21–30], which, when paired with\nShark Bay’s cluttered channel substrate, explains why dolphins probe\nthe seafloor and benefit from using sponge tools. Similar to ant-fishing\nchimpanzees whose tool use is a function of prey type [49], dolphin\ntool use directly relates to the physical characteristics of their prey. As\nsuch, this study emphasizes the critical role ecological factors play in\nexplaining behavioral complexity.\nMaterials and Methods\nEthics Statement\nAll animal work was approved by the Georgetown University\nAnimal Care and Use Committee (GUACUC) under permits 07-\n041 and 10-023.

One area in particular, just north of Monkey Mia\n(Figure 2), is extremely well sampled because it is very close to our\nboat-launching site. As such, spatial patterns of dolphin foraging\nbehavior in this location are unlikely the result of a bias in\nsampling effort. Using historical data, dolphin-sighting locations\nwere projected using ArcGIS Map 9.3 (WGS 1984 UTM Zone\n49S) to determine locations where dolphins sponge forage. Seven\nsemi-permanent transects were established using 1 m long star\npicket metal posts with attached buoys in locations with the highest\nnumbers of recorded sponging observations. Each 100 m transect\nwas ,200 m from adjacent transects and further split into two\nportions (NW and SE) by a mid-stake. The NW portion of each\ntransect was dedicated to systematic observational-video sampling,\nwhile the SE portion was designated for prey sample collection.\nData Collection\nFor all 7 transects, two certified divers swam out a 50 m tape\nmeasure well above the substrate to connect the NW stake to the\nmid-stake for initial transect setup. After waiting several minutes,\nboth divers then swam back towards the NW stake along one side\nof the transect line near the substrate and filmed a,2mw i d e\nbelt transect [50,51] to determine prey availability near the\nseafloor without disturbing the substrate ( Non-Sponging). Next,\ndivers swam back along the other side of the transect (,2mt o\nthe side of the tape measure) towards the mid-stake with one\ndiver pushing a 2 m long pole with a dead marine sponge\nattached along the substrate to ferret prey in the same manner as\nseen by sponging dolphins (Sponging), and the other diver filming\nthis human Sponging with a Sony HDR-XR500V HD video\ncamera in an AquaticaHD housing (Video S1). All dives were\nperformed on an Airline Supply R360XL Hookah System by J.\nSink, and were swam at a consistent speed of,17 m min\n21.O n\nthe NW portion of each transect, all prey were simply filmed and\nallowed to swim away. However, on the SE side of the transects\nseveral sample specimens of all species encountered (except\nDasyatidae and Sepiidae which all lack swimbladders) were\ncollected using hand nets for identification and dissection.\nTransect sampling was performed on two different occasions\nfor repeatability, but replicates were averaged to form a single\ntransect value. To confirm that our fine scale study in this well\nsampled area was representative of greater patterns in the bay, in\nparticular to be sure we had extracted all possibleSponging prey\nspecies, we also performed verification dives in all other general\nlocations where sponging has been observed (Figure 2). On these\nverification dives no tape measure was laid, but divers performed\nand filmed bothNon-Sponging and Sponging as described above. If\nany new species were encountered, sample specimens were\ncollected for identification and dissection. Only one infrequent\nprey species was too fast for divers to catch,Upeneus tragula,b u t\nother species in the same genus are known to have swimbladders\n[52]. Historical prey species were gathered from the long-term\nShark Bay Dolphin Research Project’s database and combined\nwith families extracted during Sponging to create a total of 29\npossible prey families. Families were used instead of individuals\ndue to the potential biases in observing accurate quantities of\nspecies consumed (e.g. researchers observe dolphins consuming\nsurface dwelling prey more often than benthic prey since dolphins\nregularly consume these prey near the surface, in plain site).\nUsing families allows us to avoid these potential biases and\nexplore how dolphins consume the richness of prey they\nencounter. Swimbladder status for prey families not collected\nand prey from video only identified to the level of family was\ndetermined using primary literature [32,52–62]. All data in\nTable 1 and Table S1 follow the currently accepted scientific and\ncommon names according to Froese and Pauly (2008) [63] and all\nanalyses were performed at the family level.\nData processing and statistical analysis\nMany of the species encountered were quite small, averaging\nless than 7 cm in length. Such small prey are unlikely to be\ntargeted during sponging because prey this size can easily be\nobtained at the surface in all habitats, even by young calves\n[64,65]. Thus, these prey were removed from prey abundance\ndata. A total of 19 prey encountered could not be identified to the\nlevel of family; however, all were estimated to be less than 7 cm in\nlength and thus excluded from the final data set. There is a chance\nprey were missed during video logging or were simply not\ncaptured on film; however, it is likely that all such prey would also\nbe less than 7 cm in length and thus excluded since prey larger\nthan this would be obvious to divers and not overlooked.\nThe ratio of prey without swimbladders to those with swimbladders\nwas compared betweenSponging and Non-Spongingon transects using a\nWilcoxon signed-rank test. Here, prey abundance data were\ntransformed by adding one to all samples before ratios were\ncalculated to correct for samples with zero individuals in either\ngroup, which results in an undefined ratio. We also compared the\nabundance of prey families extracted duringSponging on transects to\nthe abundance of these same families duringNon-Spongingon transects\nusing a Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Finally, we compared data from\nSponging dives to data from our long-term study. For this final analysis\nwe used a two-tailed permutation test to compare the observed\nnumber of families with and without swimbladders fromSponging to\nthe expected number based on combinedSponging and historical prey\ndata. We re-sampled (with replacement) 8 prey families 10,000 times\nfrom 29 possible families (Table S1) and determined the likelihood of\nobtaining our observed humanSpongingdata by chance. While Table 1\npresent abundance data pooled from all dives for descriptive purposes,\nall statistical analyses were performed only using the systematic\ntransect data for which we could be sure that the substrate traversed\nduring Sponging and Non-Spongingwere equal. All statistical tests were\nperformed in R 2.12.1 statisticalenvironment (R Development Core\nTeam, 2011) and considered significant for P,0.05.\nSupporting Information\nTable S1 Sponging and historical prey families.
