Given their advanced capabilities, the role of \nLarge Language Models (LLMs) in generating tumor board decisions for otorhinolaryngology (ORL) head and neck surgery \nis gaining increasing attention. However, concerns over data protection and the use of confidential patient information in \nweb-based LLMs have restricted their widespread adoption and hindered the exploration of their full potential. In this first \nstudy of its kind we compared standard human multidisciplinary tumor board recommendations (MDT) against a web-based \nLLM (ChatGPT-4o) and a locally run LLM (Llama 3) addressing data protection concerns.\nMaterial and methods Twenty-five simulated tumor board cases were presented to an MDT composed of specialists from \notorhinolaryngology, craniomaxillofacial surgery, medical oncology, radiology, radiation oncology, and pathology. This \nmultidisciplinary team provided a comprehensive analysis of the cases. The same cases were input into ChatGPT-4o and \nLlama 3 using structured prompts, and the concordance between the LLMs' and MDT’s recommendations was assessed. \nFour MDT members evaluated the LLMs' recommendations in terms of medical adequacy (using a six-point Likert scale) \nand whether the information provided could have influenced the MDT's original recommendations.\nResults ChatGPT-4o showed 84% concordance (21 out of 25 cases) and Llama 3 demonstrated 92% concordance (23 out \nof 25 cases) with the MDT in distinguishing between curative and palliative treatment strategies. In 64% of cases (16/25) \nChatGPT-4o and in 60% of cases (15/25) Llama, identified all first-line therapy options considered by the MDT, though with \nvarying priority. ChatGPT-4o presented all the MDT’s first-line therapies in 52% of cases (13/25), while Llama 3 offered a \nhomologous treatment strategy in 48% of cases (12/25). Additionally, both models proposed at least one of the MDT's first-\nline therapies as their top recommendation in 28% of cases (7/25). The ratings for medical adequacy yielded a mean score \nof 4.7 (IQR: 4–6) for ChatGPT-4o and 4.3 (IQR: 3–5) for Llama 3. In 17% of the assessments (33/200), MDT members \nindicated that the LLM recommendations could potentially enhance the MDT's decisions.\nDiscussion This study demonstrates the capability of both LLMs to provide viable therapeutic recommendations in ORL \nhead and neck surgery. Llama 3, operating locally, bypasses many data protection issues and shows promise as a clinical \ntool to support MDT decisions. However at present, LLMs should augment rather than replace human decision-making.\nKeywords Large language models · LLM · Artificial intelligence · AI · ChatGPT · Llama · Otorhinolaryngology · ORL · \nHead and neck · Digital health · Chatbot · Language model\nIntroduction\nMultidisciplinary (human) tumor boards (MDTs) are a \nvital component of contemporary cancer treatment, allow -\ning for collaborative decision-making among healthcare \nspecialists from various disciplines. These discussions \nensure that patients receive individually tailored treatment Extended author information available on the last page of the article\n1594 European Archives of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology (2025) 282:1593–1607\nplans based on expert opinions [1 ]. Nevertheless, the pre- \nand post-processing of MDT is time consuming and may \ndelay treatment. Moreover, geographical factors can also \nbias decisions as local resources differ [2 ].\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have recently demon-\nstrated the capacity to quickly and efficiently process com-\nplex medical data, offering accurate interpretations [3 –6]. \nThese models leverage transformer-based architectures, \nwhich allow for parallel processing of large amounts of \ndata, making them powerful tools in addressing the limi-\ntations of traditional MDTs [7 , 8]. LLMs hold the poten-\ntial to either support or supplement MDT-based tumor \nmanagement decisions by providing real-time, impartial \nrecommendations based on the latest available medical \nliterature.\nDespite these advantages, the use of web-based LLMs in \nclinical decision-making has been hampered by concerns \naround data protection and patient confidentiality [9]. This is \nespecially true in medical fields, where sensitive patient data \nmust be handled with the utmost care [10–12]. Locally oper-\nated LLMs present a promising alternative, as they function \noffline, eliminating the need for data transmission over the \ninternet and mitigating the risk of data leakage [13].\nPrevious studies have explored the potential of LLMs in \nassisting MDTs [14, 15]. Early evaluations of models like \nChatGPT in ORL, head and neck surgery have shown some \nlimitations, including a lack of personalized treatment plans \nand inconsistency in recommendations [16–18]. These stud-\nies were generally based on expert reviews of LLM outputs \nrather than direct comparisons to MDT recommendations, \nand they did not address whether LLM-generated infor -\nmation could influence MDT decisions. Furthermore, the \nreliance on web-based LLMs in prior research has raised \nconcerns about data security, limiting the real-world clinical \napplicability of these findings.\nIn this study, we present the first comparison between \nrecommendations made by a standard human MDT in ORL, \nhead and neck surgery and those generated by two LLMs: \na web-based model (ChatGPT-4o) and a locally operated \nmodel (Llama 3). By addressing the data security concerns \nof web-based systems, this study seeks to evaluate whether \nlocally run LLMs can offer a secure tool to augment and \nimprove cancer management decision-making in ORL, head, \nand neck surgery.\nMaterial and methods\nThe study was performed as follows (Fig.  1). Twenty-five \ncases resembling patients with a malignant disease from \nORL, head and neck surgery were designed (Table 1). \nProfiles were correlated with realistic clinical scenarios \nfrom the author's clinical experience and reviewed by four \nexperienced senior consultants. Each case was prepared in \nthe same semantic fashion including age, sex, ECOG sta-\ndium, medical history, oncological history, drug consump-\ntion (cigarettes, alcohol), tumor entity, localization, first \ndiagnosis, TNM-stadium, histological type, p16-, PD-L1 \nstatus, grading and treatment history to date. Each case \nwas then presented in a multidisciplinary MDT. The imple-\nmented MDT included an otorhinolaryngologist, maxillofa-\ncial surgeon, radiation oncologist, medical oncologist, radi-\nologist and a pathologist. MDT members were chosen from \ndifferent affiliations in order to reduce geographical bias. In \na virtually held MDT consultation each case was discussed \nand therapeutic regimen was recommended.\nSubsequently, each individual tumor case was passed to \ntwo different LLMs. Different prompting strategies inspired \nby Griewing et al. were tried, to exclude biased output [15]. \nThe finally implemented prompt also stated the patient's \nFig. 1  Workflow of the study\n\n1595European Archives of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology (2025) 282:1593–1607 \nTable 1  Constructed cases\nLarynx (L)\nL1 L2 L3 L4 L5 L6 L7 L8\nAge 63 70 65 50 68 66 83 37\nSex Male Male Male Male Male Female Male Male\nECOG-score 1 3 1 0 3 1 4 1\nRelevant illnesses Coronary heart \ndisease, stent \n(age 60), chronic \nobstructive pul-\nmonary disease, \nGold III\nDry alcoholic, liver \ncirrhosis, Child–\nPugh A\nCoronary heart dis-\nease, myocardial \ninfarction (age \n58)\nDepression Arterial hyperten-\nsion\n– Coronary heart dis-\nease; peripheral \nartery disease \n(iliac stent inser-\ntion 10 years \nago); hyper-\ntension, atrial \nfibrillation, heart \nfailure NYHA \nIII, chronic renal \nfailure, oral anti-\ncoagulation with \nXarelto + ASA\n–\nOncological history – –  –  – T3 N2c M0 \ntransoral tumor \nresection of an \noropharyngeal \ncarcinoma, \nneck dissection \non both sides, \nadjuvant radiation \ntherapy 10 years \nago\n– Prostate cancer \n2020, transure-\nthral resection of \nthe prostate\n-\nSmoking 60 pack years 40 pack years 35 pack years 37 pack years 20 pack years – 50 pack years \n(stopped 20 years \nago)\n55 pack years\nDrinking – Dry – – Active – Occasionally –\nTumor entity Laryngeal cancer Laryngeal cancer Laryngeal cancer Laryngeal cancer Laryngeal cancer Laryngeal cancer Laryngeal cancer\nLocalization Anterior commis-\nsure\nSupra glottic Anterior commis-\nsure/vestibular \nfold\nGlottic vocal fold \nleft\n –  –  –  –\nFirst diagnosis 2 month ago This month This month This month This month This month This month This month\nTNM first diag-\nnosis\ncT1b cN0 cM0 cT4a cN1 cM0 rcT3 cN1 cM0 cT1a N0 M0 cT4cN2bcM0 cT2 cN0 cM0 cT3 cN1 cM0 cT2 cN0 cM0\nTNM  –  –  –  –  –  –  –  –\nHistological sub-\ntype\nSquamous-cell \ncarcinoma\nSquamous-cell \ncarcinoma\nSquamous-cell \ncarcinoma\nSquamous-cell \ncarcinoma\nSquamous-cell \ncarcinoma\nChondrosarcoma Squamous-cell \ncarcinoma\nSquamous-cell \ncarcinoma\n1596 European Archives of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology (2025) 282:1593–1607\nTable 1  (continued)\nLarynx (L)\nL1 L2 L3 L4 L5 L6 L7 L8\nPrevious therapy \nand course\nMicrolaryngoscopy Emergency trache-\nostomy, biopsy\nLaser resec-\ntion T2N0M0 \n(5 months ago)\nControl panendos-\ncopy (1 week \nago)\nMicrolaryngoscopy Panendoscopy 1. \nVocal fold on the \nright 2.

The local LLM was run on a standard Mac-\nBook Pro 2023, M3 Pro, 18 GB RAM (Apple, California, \nUSA).\nRecommendations of the human tumor board, web-based \nChatGPT-4o and locally Llama 3 were accumulated in an \nExcel sheet to allow a side-by-side comparison and ana-\nlyzing concordance. Moreover, 4 members of the MDT \nrated recommendations provided by ChatGPT-4o and \nLlama 3 for medical adequacy on a 6-point Likert-scale \n(0 = very poor, 6  = excellent). Furthermore, the 4 raters \nstated if, in their opinion, the information provided by the \nLLM might have influenced the recommendation of the \nMDT (yes/no/abstention). Moreover, there was space for \nraters to express free text comments.\nStatistical analysis of Likert-scale ordinal variables \n(qualitative-ordinal) was performed with GraphPad Prism \nfor MacOS Version 10.3.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, \nCA, USA). Normality distribution was tested with the \nD’ Agostino and Pearson test. Group comparisons were per-\nformed using the Mann Whitney Test. Ethics approval was \nnot required as no real patient data was processed.\nResults\nAn overview of the therapy recommendations as stated by \nthe MDT, ChatGPT-4o and Llama 3 as well as their rec -\nommendation on curative or palliative therapy regimen and \nagreement in first-line therapy regimen for each specific case \nare shown in Table 2.\nTable 3 summarizes the comparison between the MDT, \nChatGPT-4o and Llama 3. The human tumor board sug-\ngested a curative therapy regimen for 88% (22/25), Chat-\nGPT-4o for 72% (18/25) and Llama 3 88% (22/25) of the \ncases. Thus, a palliative strategy was stated for 12% (3/25) \nof the cases by the human tumor board and Llama 3, while \nChatGPT-4o suggested a palliative scenario 28% (7/25). \nChatGPT-4o and the human tumor board showed a con -\ncordance for this aspect of 84% (21/25). In all cases of dis-\ncordance ChatGPT-4o favored a palliative therapy whereas \nthe human board suggested a curative therapy regimen. \nLlama 3 showed a concordance of 92% (23/25) with the \nhuman board.\nIn 64% (16/25) of the instances ChatGPT-4o and in \n60% of cases (15/25) Llama 3 mentioned all first-line rec-\nommendation provided by the human board as a possible \ntherapy regimen, although sometimes in a different order. \nWhereas ChatGPT-4o stated at least one of the first-line \nrecommendations in another 12% (3/25) of the instances, \nLlama 3 did so in 8% (2/25) more instances. While Chat-\nGPT-4o stated all first-line therapy regimen as stated by \nthe human board in 52% (13/25), Llama 3 showed this \nhigh concordance in 48% (12/25). Both, ChatGPT-4o and \nLlama 3 stated at least one of the human board´s first-line \ntherapy regimen as first-line regimen in 20% (5/25) of \nthe cases each.\nThe rating of 4  MDT revealed a mean score of \n4.7 (IQR 4–6) for ChatGPT-4o and a significant inferior \n(p < 0.001) mean score of 4.3 (IQR 3–5) for Llama 3 on \nmedical adequacy (Fig. 3). For one patient, two raters con-\ncluded that the additional information from the LLM might \nhave influenced the MDT decision. In this case, the patient \nhad ECOG stage 3 and the MDT had suggested a curative \ntreatment regimen. Overall, the raters stated that the infor -\nmation from the LLM could have influenced the decision \nof the tumor board in 17% (33/200) of the cases. However, \nthis statement varied beyond raters. One rater stated that \nthe information from the LLMs may have influenced the \ndecision in for 32% (8/25) of the cases for ChatGPT-4o and \nLlama 3, respectively. In contrast, another rater saw no pos-\nsible influence on the MDT decision in any case.\nWhereas the human tumor board usually provided \ndetailed information about the surgery, the LLMs often rec-\nommend surgical therapy without specification or the extent \nof surgery. Although web-based ChatGPT-4o and locally run \nLlama 3 received exactly the same prompts, ChatGPT-4o \nresponded in German whereas Llama 3 answered in Eng-\nlish language. While ChatGPT-4o met the word limit every \nsingle time (mean 150 words), Llama 3 provided too long \nanswers and met the word limit just once (mean 246 words). \nOnce Llama 3 pretended to “accept” the word limit by pro-\nviding “Word count: 199” at the end of the response, in this \ncase the response was 248 word long.\nDiscussion\nPrevious monocentric studies evaluated the feasibility of \nLLMs in providing recommendations for tumor treatment \nregimes in ORL, head and neck surgery [16–18]. However, \nmost of these studies were dedicated to older versions and \nmainly focused solely on ChatGPT, with one exception \nevaluating Claude 3.\nOur study however is the first one evaluating the web-\nbased ChatGPT-4o and, in order to address data protection \nqueries, the locally run LLM (Llama 3). In contrast to prior \nstudies, recommendations of the LLMs were directly com-\npared to human tumor board decisions and subsequently \nrated by experts. More specific, four MDT members evalu-\nated the LLMs' recommendations for medical adequacy \nusing a 6-point Likert scale and assessed whether the pro-\nvided information could have influenced the MDT's final \ndecision.\n1602 European Archives of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology (2025) 282:1593–1607\nOur findings reveal high concordance between the \nLLMs and the MDT, particularly in the critical distinction \nbetween curative and palliative therapy strategies. Llama 3, \nthe locally run model, exhibited a 92% (23/25) concordance \nrate with the MDT, while ChatGPT-4o achieved 84% \n(21/25). ChatGPT-4o mentioned all first-line recommenda-\ntion of the MDT in 64% (16/25) of the patients, Llama in \n60% (15/25).

While the MDT provided a more \ndetailed surgical therapy plan i.e. “local resection and neck \ndissection ipsilateral” the LLMs frequently lack specifica-\ntion of the surgery. This is particularly problematic if the \nLLM, like Llama did in an exemplary case (M1), concen-\ntrates on the resection of the primary tumor and does not \nmention a necessary neck dissection.\nTo provide a realistic setting, we intentionally imple-\nmented some obstacles into the patient profiles to provide \na more realistic setup of flawed and/or misleading submis -\nsions to the MDT. In one case a patient with cT3 cN3 cM0 \nHypopharynx Carcinoma (P3) without any actual histo-\npathological confirmation, both ChatGPT-4o and Llama 3 \nsuggested treatment plans whereas the MDT recommended \na panendoscopy with subsequent biopsy first. In this case, \nChatGPT-4o suggested a palliative therapy for a tumor \nwhich was not histologically proven at that time. Llama \n3 recommended primary chemoradiotherapy as first line \ntherapy although neither histological evaluation nor a sur -\ngeon's statement regarding resectability was apparent.\nA further pitfall for the LLMs was a cancer of unknown \nprimary (CUP) Syndrome (CUP1). Here none of the LLMs \nsuggested a CUP panendoscopy or a PET CT like the \nMDT. In addition, Llama did not realize that the primary \ntumor localisation is in fact unknown and therefore its \nresection is not feasible.\nFurthermore, in one instance (M2) Llama did not real-\nize that the patient had already undergone surgery with \ncurative intent and that the presentation was only for adju-\nvant therapy. Here, one can argue that the prompt should \nhave been adapted, as MDT submissions usually also pro-\nvide information about a pre- or post-therapeutic presenta-\ntion. However, the simulated case represents a scenario of \nan imperfect submission, which unfortunately does occur \nin everyday clinical practice.\nMoreover, we noticed that Llama 3 ignored the German \ninput by answering in English instead of German all the \ntime. The same happened with regards to the word limit, \nnot only did Llama 3 exceed the word limit nearly every \ntime, in one case Llama 3 even claimed to respect the word \nlimit even though it was exceeded. These examples suggest \nthat LLMs tend to ignore instruction if they are not capa-\nble of fulfilling them, rather than admitting deficiencies. \nEspecially for tumor treatment plans this is hazardous and \nshould be considered when consulting LLMs in these mat-\nters. This fact underlines the inference of previous studies \n(in ORL and beyond) that LLMs are very promising for \naugmenting MDT but cannot and should not replace them \n[14–17].\nDespite some fundamental flaws, the LLMs received \nrespectable ratings for medical adequacy on a 6-point \nLikert-scale by our 4 evaluating MDT members visual-\nized by a mean score of 4.7 (IQR 4–6) for ChatGPT-4o and \n4.3 (IQR 3–5) for Llama 3 (Fig. 3). This might be explained \nby the fact that allegedly less important facts, such as ECOG \nstatus or smoking history, can easily fade into the back -\nground in a MDT whilst they were frequently highlighted \nby the LLMs. In our study, the MDT had suggested a cura-\ntive treatment regimen for a patient with ECOG stage 3 (L2). \nHere, two raters stated that the information from the LLM \nmight have changed the recommendation of the MDT. Raters \nfound it positive that the LLMs highlighted chronic diseases \nof the patients and addiction history. Overall, raters stated in \n17% (33/150) of the ratings, that the information of the LLM \nmight have changed the recommendation of the board. In \nindividual cases, the use of LLMs can therefore potentially \nhave a very positive influence on the fate of a patient. Par -\nticularly when considering the fact that the resources for an \nMDT can vary enormously depending on the environment \nof MDTs [2].\nFig. 3  Medical Adequacy for recommendations stated by ChatGPT-\n4o (mean 4.7; range 1–6) and Llama 3 (mean 4.3; range 1–6) as rated \nby the 4 MDT members. Data shown as a scatter dot blot with each \npoint resembling an absolute value (bar width resembling a high \namount of individual values).  Normality distribution was tested with \nthe D’ Agostino and Pearson test. Group comparisons were performed \nusing the Mann Whitney Test. *p < 0.05\n1606 European Archives of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology (2025) 282:1593–1607\nObviously, this study has some limitations, including the \nfact that constructed cases instead of real patient profiles \nwere used. However, even after anonymization of data sets, \nentry of real cases into a web-based LLM was not approved \nby our data protection officer. As a comparison of the web-\nbased LLM ChatGPT-4o and the locally run LLM Llama 3 \nwas a key objective of this study we were limited to con-\nstructed patient profiles. Moreover, one could argue that a \nMDT resembling members from different affiliations is no \nrealistic scenario, however, we choose this design by default \nin order to limit subjective and institutional biases within \nthe MDT decision. In fact, we noticed local differences in \ndefault treatment regimens, for instance whereas in one insti-\ntution a dental renovation is implemented prior to radiation \ntherapy, other institutions waive the step in order to acceler-\nate the start of the treatment. This emphasizes exemplary the \nvirtue of a multicentric approach.\nTaking these limitations into account, the present study \nis the first study evaluating a locally run LLM (Llama 3) on \nORL, head and neck surgery MDT recommendations. Inter-\nestingly, the results of the local LLM (Llama 3) were inferior \nto the web-based ChatGPT-4o. With regard to the decision \non a curative or palliative procedure, the agreement between \nthe MDT and the local Llama 3 LLM was even higher. Since \nthis is the first study in ORL, head and neck surgery evaluat-\ning a local LLM, the potential for optimization is certainly \nnot exhausted yet. First, newer versions and the comparison \nof different local LLMs might improve results. Secondly, \nspecial training on specific ORL, head and neck literature \nand aligned prompting might further improve the outcome. \nIt is therefore likely that local LLMs will catch up with the \nweb-based versions in the near future. Especially in medi-\ncine, passing highly sensitive private patient data to privately \nowned, web-based LLMs is hardly imaginable in clinical \npractice [9]. Despite data privacy, the open-access structure \nof local LLMs is quite cost-effective requiring just a sole \nstandard computer available for less than €1000. Further -\nmore, local LLMs provide the opportunity of deployment \nin remote regions without internet connection. Thus, these \nmodels represent also a great opportunity for low-resource \nsettings in low and middle income countries (LMICs). \nFuture research regarding medical application should there-\nfore focus on local LLMs.\nWith regards to the local and open-source character of \nLlama 3, the results of this study might reflect an important \nstep to actual implementation of locally run, data protec-\ntion compliant LLMs into real clinical practice. Despite our \npromising findings, it is unlikely that MDTs are close to \nbeing replaced by LLMs. Human assessment in tumor board \ndecision-making currently proves more reliable than LLM-\ndriven assessments, especially as they will be reluctant to \nput any decision making regarding their therapeutic faith in \nthe hands of a computer [19]. Additionally, the medicolegal \nimplications are entirely unclear at this point. Rather MDTs \nare likely to be augmented by locally run LLMs helping to \nreduce geographical bias of tumor boards [2 , 20]. Future \nstudies should thus evaluate the integration of (local) LLMs \nin the MDT process.\nFunding Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt \nDEAL.\nData availability The relevant data to support the results are included \nin the manuscript.\nOpen Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attri-\nbution 4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing, adapta-\ntion, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long \nas you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, \nprovide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if changes \nwere made.
