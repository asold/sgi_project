    "abstract": "A conversational system is an artificial intelligence application designed to interact with users in natural language, providing accurate and contextually relevant responses. Building such systems for low-resource languages like Swahili presents significant challenges due to the limited availability of large-scale training datasets. This paper proposes a Retrieval-Augmented Generation-based system to address these challenges and improve the quality of Swahili conversational AI. The system leverages fine-tuning, where models are trained on available Swahili data, combined with external knowledge retrieval to enhance response accuracy and fluency. Four models—mT5, GPT-2, mBART, and GPT-Neo—were evaluated using metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, Query Performance, and inference time. Results show that Retrieval-Augmented Generation consistently outperforms fine-tuning alone, particularly in generating detailed and contextually appropriate responses. Among the tested models, mT5 with Retrieval-Augmented Generation demonstrated the best performance, achieving a BLEU score of 56.88%, a METEOR score of 72.72%, and a Query Performance score of 84.34%, while maintaining relevance and fluency. Although Retrieval-Augmented Generation introduces slightly longer response times, its ability to significantly improve response quality makes it an effective approach for Swahili conversational systems. This study highlights the potential of Retrieval-Augmented Generation to advance conversational AI for Swahili and other low-resource languages, with future work focusing on optimizing efficiency and exploring multilingual applications.",
