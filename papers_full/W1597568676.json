  "abstract": "The practical implementation of transient based protection and its application to power system protection schemes depends on the availability of transducers suitable for providing access to the higher frequency transients produced by faults and other system disturbances. This paper presents the results of a laboratory investigation into the suitability of using MV distribution system current transformers as transducers for accessing the high frequency transients used in transient based protection schemes. The investigation has concentrated on the frequency range of 1 to 100 kHz and examined a variety of current transformers of different types and ages. These included standard distribution system CTs, class X CTs and split core CTs. The ages of these CTs varied from new devices that had recently been manufactured to units that had been withdrawn from service after thirty or more years in the field. In addition to examining the high frequency response of the current transformers while they were operating with standard power system frequency signals, the investigation also examined their high frequency response when their cores were saturated.",
