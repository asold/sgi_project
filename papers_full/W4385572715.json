In addition, social\npsychology studies have shown that this stigma\nmanifests differently for different genders: mental\nillness is more visibly associated with women, but\ntends to be more harshly derided in men (Chatmon,\n2020). This asymmetrical stigma constitutes harms\ntowards both men and women, increasing the risks\nof under-diagnosis or over-diagnosis respectively.\nSince language is central to psychotherapy and\npeer support, NLP models have been increasingly\n∗ Indicates equal contribution.\nFigure 1: We investigate masked language models’ bi-\nases at the intersection of gender and mental health. Us-\ning theoretically-motivated prompts about mental health\nconditions, we have models fill in the masked token,\nthen examine the probabilities of generated words with\ngender associations.\nemployed on mental health-related tasks (Chancel-\nlor and De Choudhury, 2020; Sharma et al., 2021,\n2022; Zhang and Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil, 2020).\nMany approaches developed for these purposes rely\non pretrained language models, thus running the\nrisk of incorporating any pre-learned biases these\nmodels may contain (Straw and Callison-Burch,\n2020). However, no prior research has examined\nhow biases related to mental health stigma are rep-\nresented in language models. Understanding if and\nhow pretrained language models encode mental\nhealth stigma is important for developing fair, re-\nsponsible mental health applications. To the best\nof our knowledge, our work is the first to opera-\ntionalize mental health stigma in NLP research and\naim to understand the intersection between mental\nhealth and gender in language models.\nIn this work, we propose a framework to inves-\ntigate joint encoding of gender bias and mental\nhealth stigma in masked language models (MLMs),\nwhich have become widely used in downstream\n2152\napplications (Devlin et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019).\nOur framework uses questionnaires developed\nin psychology research to curate prompts about\nmental health conditions. Then, with several se-\nlected language models, we mask out parts of\nthese prompts and examine the model’s tendency\nto generate explicitly gendered words, including\npronouns, nouns, first names, and noun phrases.1\nIn order to disentangle general gender biases from\ngender biases tied to mental health stigma, we com-\npare these results with prompts describing health\nconditions that are not related to mental health.\nAdditionally, to understand the effects of domain-\nspecific training data, we investigate both general-\npurpose MLMs and MLMs pretrained on mental\nhealth corpora. We aim to answer the two research\nquestions below.\nRQ1: Do MLMs associate mental health con-\nditions with a particular gender? To answer\nRQ1, we curate three sets of prompts that reflect\nthree healthcare-seeking phases: diagnosis, inten-\ntion, and action, based on the widely-cited Health\nAction Process Approach (Schwarzer et al., 2011).\nWe prompt the models to generate the subjects of\nsentences that indicate someone is (1) diagnosed\nwith a mental health condition, (2) intending to\nseek help or treatment for a mental health condi-\ntion, and (3) taking action to get treatment for a\nmental health condition. We find that models asso-\nciate mental health conditions more strongly with\nwomen than with men, and that this disparity is ex-\nacerbated with sentences indicating intention and\naction to seek treatment. However, MLMs pre-\ntrained on mental health corpora reduce this gender\ndisparity and promote gender-neutral subjects.\nRQ2: How do MLMs’ embedded preconcep-\ntions of stereotypical attributes in people with\nmental health conditions differ across genders?\nTo answer RQ2, we create a set of prompts that de-\nscribe stereotypical views of someone with a men-\ntal health condition by rephrasing questions from\nthe Attribution Questionnaire (AQ-27), which is\nwidely used to evaluate mental health stigma in\npsychology research (Corrigan et al., 2003). Then,\nusing a recursive heuristic, we prompt the mod-\nels to generate gendered phrases and compare the\naggregate probabilities of different genders. We\nfind that MLMs pretrained on mental health cor-\n1We focus most of our analyses on binary genders (female\nand male), due to the lack of gold-standard annotations of\nlanguage indicating non-binary and transgender. We discuss\nmore details of this limitation in § 6.\npora associate stereotypes like anger, blame, and\npity more strongly with women than men, while\nassociating avoidance and lack of help with men.\nOur empirical results from these two research\nquestions demonstrate that models do perpetu-\nate harmful patterns of overlooking men’s mental\nhealth and capture social stereotypes of men be-\ning less likely to receive care for mental illnesses.\nHowever, different models reduce stigma in some\nways and increase it in other ways, which has sig-\nnificant implications for the use of NLP in men-\ntal health as well as in healthcare in general. In\nshowing the complex nuances of models’ gendered\nmental health stigma, we demonstrate that context\nand overlapping dimensions of identity are impor-\ntant considerations when assessing computational\nmodels’ social biases and applying these models in\ndownstream applications.2\n2 Background and Related Work\nMental health stigma and gender. Mental health\nstigma can be defined as the negative perceptions of\nindividuals based on their mental health status (Cor-\nrigan and Watson, 2002). This definition is implic-\nitly composed of two pieces: assumptions about\nwho may have mental health conditions in the first\nplace, and assumptions about what such people\nare like in terms of characteristics and personal-\nity. Thus, our study at the intersection of gender\nbias and mental health stigma is twofold: whether\nmodels associate mental health conditions with a\nparticular gender, and what presuppositions these\nmodels have towards different genders with mental\nillness.\nMultiple psychology studies have reported that\nmental health stigma manifests differently for dif-\nferent genders (Sickel et al., 2014; Chatmon, 2020).\nRegarding the first aspect of stigma, mental ill-\nness is consistently more associated with women\nthan men. The World Health Organization (WHO)\nreports a greater number of mental health diag-\nnoses in women than in men (WHO, 2021), but the\nfewer diagnoses in men does not indicate that men\nstruggle less with mental health. Rather, men are\nless likely to seek help and are significantly under-\ndiagnosed, and stigma has been cited as a leading\nbarrier to their care (Chatmon, 2020).\nRegarding the second aspect of stigma, prior\nwork in psychology has developed ways to evalu-\n2Code and data are publicly available at https://github.\ncom/LucilleN/Gendered-MH-Stigma-in-Masked-LMs .\n2153\nate specific stereotypes towards individuals with\nmental illness. Specifically, the widely used attri-\nbution model developed by Corrigan et al. (2003)\ndefines nine dimensions of stigma 3 about people\nwith mental illness: blame, anger, pity, help, dan-\ngerousness, fear, avoidance, segregation, and coer-\ncion. The model uses a questionnaire (AQ-27) to\nevaluate the respondent’s stereotypical perceptions\ntowards people with mental health conditions (Cor-\nrigan et al., 2003). To the best of our knowledge,\nno prior work has examined how these stereotypes4\ndiffer towards people with mental health conditions\nfrom different gender groups.\nBias research in NLP. There is a large body\nof prior work on bias in NLP models, particularly\nfocusing on gender, race, and disability (Garrido-\nMuñoz et al., 2021; Blodgett et al., 2020; Liang\net al., 2021). Most of these works study bias in\na single dimension as intersectionality is difficult\nto operationalize (Field et al., 2021), though a\nfew have investigated intersections like gender and\nrace (Tan and Celis, 2019; Davidson et al., 2019).\nOur methodology follows prior works that used\ncontrastive sentence pairs to identify bias (Nan-\ngia et al., 2020; Nadeem et al., 2020; Zhao et al.,\n2018; Rudinger et al., 2018), but unlike existing\nresearch, we draw our prompts and definitions of\nstigma directly from psychology studies (Corrigan\net al., 2003; Schwarzer et al., 2011).\nMental health related bias in NLP.There has\nbeen very little work examining mental health bias\nin existing models. One relevant work evaluated\nmental health bias in two commonly used word\nembeddings, GloVe and Word2Vec (Straw and\nCallison-Burch, 2020). Our project expands upon\nthis work as we focus on more recent MLMs, in-\ncluding general-purpose MLM RoBERTa, as well\nas MLMs pretrained on health and mental health\ncorpora, MentalRoBERTa (Ji et al., 2021) and Clin-\nicalLongformer (Li et al., 2022).\n3 Methodology\nWe develop a framework grounded in social psy-\nchology literature to measure MLMs’ gendered\n3We use stigma in this paper to refer to public stigma,\nwhich can be more often reflected in language than other types\nof stigma: self stigma and label avoidance.\n4Dimensions of stigma refers to the nine dimensions of\npublic stigma of mental health, stereotypes towards people\nwith mental health conditions refers to specific stereotypical\nperceptions. For example, “dangerousness” is a dimension of\nstigma and “people with schizophrenia are dangerous” is a\nstereotype.\nmental health biases. Our core methodology\ncenters around (1) curating mental-health-related\nprompts and (2) comparing the gender associations\nof tokens generated by the MLMs. 5 In this section,\nwe discuss methods for the two research questions\nintroduced in § 2.\n3.1 RQ1: General Gender Associations with\nMental Health Status\nRQ1 explores whether models associate mental ill-\nness more with a particular gender. To explore\nthis, we conduct experiments in which we mask\nout the subjects 6 in the sentences, then evaluate the\nmodel’s likelihood of filling in the masked subjects\nwith male, female, or gender-unspecified words,\nwhich include pronouns, nouns, and names. The\noverarching idea is that if the model is consistently\nmore likely to predict a female subject, this would\nindicate that the model might be encoding preexist-\ning societal presuppositions that women are more\nlikely to have a mental health condition. We an-\nalyze these likelihoods quantitatively to identify\nstatistically significant patterns in the model’s gen-\nder choices.\nPrompt Curation. We manually construct three\nsets of simple prompts that reflect different stages\nof seeking healthcare. These stages are grounded\nin the Health Action Process Approach (HAPA)\n(Schwarzer et al., 2011), a psychology theory that\nmodels how individuals’ health behaviors change.\nWe develop prompt templates in three different\nstages to explore stigma at different parts of the\nprocess, differentiating being diagnosed from in-\ntending to seek care and from actually taking ac-\ntion to receive care. For each prompt template,\nwe create 11 sentences by replacing “[diagnosis]”\nwith one of the top-11 mental health (MH) or non-\nmental-health-related (non-MH) diagnoses (more\ndetails in § 3.3). Example templates and their corre-\nsponding health action phases include: • Diagnosis:\n“<mask> has [diagnosis]” • Intention: “<mask> is\nlooking for a therapist for [diagnosis]” • Action:\n“<mask> takes medication for [diagnosis]” The full\nlist of prompts can be found in Appendix A.\nMask Values. For each prompt, we identify\nfemale, male, and unspecified-gender words in\n5We choose to use mask-filling, as opposed to generating\nfree text or dialogue responses about mental health, because\nmask-filling provides a more controlled framework: there are\na finite set of options to define the mask in a sentence, which\nmakes it easier to analyze and interpret the results.\n6\"Subject\" refers to the person being described, which may\nor may not be the grammatical subject of the sentence.\n2154\nthe model’s mask generations and aggregate their\nprobabilities (see footnote 1). Most prior work\nhas primarily considered pronouns as represen-\ntations of gender (Rudinger et al., 2018; Zhao\net al., 2018). However, nouns and names are\nalso common in mental health contexts, such as\nonline health forums and therapy transcripts. In\nfact, some names and nouns frequently appear in\nthe top generations of masked tokens. Thus, we\nlook for: (1) Binary-gendered pronouns (e.g., “He”\nand “She”). (2) Explicitly gendered nouns (e.g.,\n“Father” and “Mother”). We draw this list of 66\nnouns from Field and Tsvetkov (2020). (3) Gender-\nassociated first names (e.g., “David” and “Mary”).\nWe identify the top 1,000 most common, unam-\nbiguous male and female first names in Field et al.\n(2022)’s Wikipedia data and consider any non-\nrepeated names in these lists to be gendered. Any\ngenerations that do not fall into the above cat-\negories are considered unspecified-gender (e.g.,\nwords like “they” and “friend”). For each prompt,\nwe sum the probabilities of all female, male, and\nunspecified-gender words with probabilities higher\nthan 0.01.\n3.2 RQ2: Gender Associations with\nDimensions of Mental Health Stigma\nRQ1 focuses on gender association in general, but\ndoes not explore specific, more nuanced stereo-\ntypes or dimensions of stigma, which we examine\nin RQ2. RQ2 investigates what personal attributes\nlanguage models associate with men and women\nwith mental illnesses. At a high level, our method-\nology for RQ2 is similar to RQ1: we once again\nmask out words that MLMs will fill with a female,\nmale, or unspecified-gender word, but we use a\ndifferent set of prompts and propose a new method\nfor generating noun phrases.\nPrompt Curation. The Attribution Question-\nnaire (AQ-27) is widely used in psychology re-\nsearch to evaluate an individual’s level of stigma\ntowards people with mental illness (Corrigan et al.,\n2003). The language used in the questionnaire has\nbeen subsequently validated by years of psychol-\nogy research, so we use these questions as the basis\nfor creating RQ2’s prompts. AQ-27 begins with a\nvignette about a hypothetical man named Harry\nwho has schizophrenia, followed by 27 Likert-\nscale questions to probe the respondent about their\nviews towards Harry. These 27 questions corre-\nspond to 9 dimensions of mental health stigma,\nwith 3 questions per dimension. Since we want\nto curate prompts that do not indicate explicit gen-\nder, we rephrase the questions into descriptive sen-\ntences. Each sentence describes a stereotypical\nview towards a masked-out subject who has a men-\ntal health condition. Similarly to RQ1, we use\nthe same set of 11 most common mental health\ndiagnoses to create 11 versions of each of these\nsentences. Examples of this set of prompts include:\n• “I would feel aggravated by a <mask> who has\n[diagnosis].” • “I think a <mask> with [diagnosis]\nshould be forced into treatment even if they do not\nwant to.” • “I feel much sympathy for a <mask>\nwith [diagnosis].” The full set of prompts is in\nAppendix B.\nRecursive Masking for Gendered Phrase Gen-\neration. Some prompts in this set describe very\nspecific situations, and the probabilities of gen-\nerating a single-token gendered subject are rela-\ntively low. To reduce the sparsity of generated\ngendered subjects, we design a recursive procedure\nthat enables generating multi-token noun phrases\nas follows. First, we pass the model an initial\nprompt: e.g. “I feel aggravated by a <mask>\nwith schizophrenia.” Then, if the model gener-\nates an unspecified-gender subject (e.g. friend), we\nprompt the model to generate a linguistic modifier\nby adding a mask token directly before the token\ngenerated in step 1: e.g., “I feel aggravated by a\n<mask> friend with schizophrenia.”7\n3.3 Experimental Setup\nModels. For each RQ, we experiment with three\nmodels: RoBERTa, MentalRoBERTa, and Clini-\ncalLongformer.8 We compare RoBERTa and Men-\ntalRoBERTa to explore the effect of pretraining a\nmodel on domain-specific social media data. We\nalso compare these to ClinicalLongformer, a model\n7We repeat step 2 a predefined number of times (n = 3),\nthough n can be adjusted to create phrases of different lengths.\nSince we mask out the subjects in the prompts, the final gen-\nerated tokens are almost always well-formed noun phrases.\nAt each recursive step, we consider the top 10 generations.\nWe stop after n = 3 steps, as generations afterwards have\nlow probabilities and do not contribute significantly to the\naggregate probabilities.\n8Although we also experimented with BERT and Men-\ntalBERT, we choose to focus our analyses on RoBERTa for\ntwo reasons: (1) RoBERTa is trained primarily on web text\nwhereas BERT’s pretraining data include BookCorpus and En-\nglish Wikipedia which may incorporate confounding gender\nstereotypes (Fast et al., 2016; Field et al., 2022); (2) RoBERTa\nis trained with a dynamic masking procedure, which poten-\ntially increases the model’s robustness. Thus, RoBERTa is\nlikely more suitable for many real-world MH-related down-\nstream applications, such as online peer support.\n2155\nDiagnosis ActionIntention\nFigure 2: RoBERTa consistently prefers female words in sentences about mental health. The disparity widens in\nprompts describing treatment-seeking behavior. <m> and [d] represent <mask> and [diagnosis], respectively.\ntrained on medical notes, because it may poten-\ntially be applicable to clinical therapeutic settings.\nA summary of the differences between these mod-\nels is in Appendix G.1.\nDiagnoses. With each of these models, we ex-\nperiment with prompts made from two different\nsets of diagnoses. For prompts about mental health,\nwe consider only the 11 most common MH disor-\nders (MedlinePlus, 2021) because of the breadth\nof mental illnesses: depression, bipolar disorder,\nanxiety, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disor-\nder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),\nanorexia, bulimia, psychosis, borderline personal-\nity disorder, and schizophrenia.\nAdditionally, to control for the confounding ef-\nfect of gender bias unrelated to mental health, we\nuse a set of non-MH-related conditions. This set\nconsists of the 11 most common general health\nproblems (Raghupathi and Raghupathi, 2018):\nheart disease, cancer, stroke, respiratory disease,\ninjuries, diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, influenza,\npneumonia, kidney disease, and septicemia.\n4 Results\nIn this section, we discuss the main results for our\ntwo research questions.9 Comprehensive results of\nall statistical tests are in Appendix C and E.\n4.1 RQ1: General Gender Associations with\nMental Health Status\nSocial psychology research has shown that men-\ntal health issues are associated more strongly with\nwomen than men (§2). RQ1 examines whether\n9We conduct t-test and use the following notation to report\nsignificance: ***: p<.001, **:p < .01, *:p < .05.

More details are in Appendix G.2.\nthese gendered mental health associations manifest\nin MLMs by comparing the probabilities of gener-\nating female, male, and unspecified-gender words\nin sentences about mental health. Figure 3 shows\na subset of results, and full results are shown in\nFigure 5.\nFemale vs. male subjects. We first compare\nRoBERTa’s probabilities of generating female and\nmale subjects when filling masks in prompts (Fig-\nure 2). Across all MH prompts, RoBERTa con-\nsistently predicts female subjects with a signif-\nicantly higher probability than male subjects\n(Figure 3B, 32% vs. 19%,p = 0.00, d = 1.6). This\ngender disparity is consistent in all three health\naction phases: diagnosis, intention, and action\n(p = 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, d = 1.7, 1.4, 1.9). How-\never, this pattern does not consistently appear in\nall three phases with non-MH diagnoses prompts\n(Figure 3C). Additionally, the gender disparity,\ni.e. PF − PM, predicted by RoBERTa is consis-\ntently higher with MH prompts than with non-MH\nprompts (13% vs. 4%, p = 0.00, d = 1.0), indicat-\ning that RoBERTa does encode gender bias specific\nto mental health.\nEffect of domain-specific pretraining. In this\nexperiment, we compare RoBERTa and Mental-\nRoBERTa to investigate whether a MLM pretrained\non MH corpora exhibits similar gender biases. We\nfind that female subjects are still more probable\nthan male subjects in MH prompts, indicating that\nthere may be some MH related gender bias. How-\never, the differences between male and female\nsubject prediction probabilities are considerably\nsmaller in MentalRoBERTa than in RoBERTa (Fig-\nure 3A, 5% vs. 13%, p = 0.00, d = 0.95). This\nsuggests that pretraining on MH-related data actu-\nally attenuates this form of gender bias.\n2156\nDiagnosis Intention Action\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5Probability\nA MentalRoBERTa - MH\nDiagnosis Intention Action\nB RoBERTa - MH\nDiagnosis Intention Action\nC RoBERTa - non-MH\nMale\nFemale\nUnspecified\nFigure 3: Probabilities of RoBERTa (B, C) and MentalRoBERTa (A) for predicting male, female, and unspecified-\ngender words. Each subplot shows prompts for three health action phases (3.1). RoBERTa (B) and MentalRoBERTa\n(A) predict female subjects with consistently higher likelihood than male subjects in mental-health-related (MH)\nprompts for all three action phases (**). These gender disparities are significantly larger in MH prompts (A, B)\nthan in non-mental-health-related (non-MH) prompts (***, C), and the disparity increases for from Diagnosis to\nIntention to Action. (***: p < .001, **: p < .01, *:p < .05)\nGender disparity across health action phases.\nNext, we explore whether models’ MH-related\ngender bias changes when prompts indicate that\na person is at different stages of receiving care:\nsimply having a diagnosis, intending to seek care,\nand actively receiving care. Even though Mental-\nRoBERTa displays less gender disparity overall, we\nfind that in both RoBERTa and MentalRoBERTa,\nthe disparity between female and male probabil-\nities increases as we progress from diagnosis to\nintention to action. The differences between the fe-\nmale and male subjects are even more pronounced\nfor action prompts, such as “<mask> sees a psy-\nchiatrist for [diagnosis],” “<mask> sees a therapist\nfor [diagnosis],” and “<mask> takes medication for\n[diagnosis]” in RoBERTa (34% vs. 19%, p = 0.00,\nd = 1 .90). The fact that the gender disparity\nwidens in treatment-seeking behavior indicates that\nboth models encode the societal constraint that\nmen are less likely to seek and receive care(Chat-\nmon, 2020).\nGender-associating vs. unspecified-gender\nsubjects. Additionally, we explore models’ ten-\ndencies to make gender assumptions at all, as\nopposed to filling masks with unspecified-gender\nwords. RoBERTa has a very low tendency to pro-\nduce unspecified-gender words in MH prompts\n(7%). On the other hand, MentalRoBERTa predicts\nunspecified-gender words (24%) with probabilities\nthat are comparable to the gendered words (21%).\nThis suggests that domain-specific pretraining on\nmental health corpora reduces the model’s tenden-\ncies to make gender assumptions at all, but there\nmight be other confounding factors. A closer exam-\nination of MentalRoBERTa’s generation shows that\nit picks up on artifacts of its Reddit training data,\nfrequently generating words like “OP” (Original\nPoster), which may have contributed to this higher\nprobability for unspecified-gender words.\nGiven the use of Reddit-specific syntax in Men-\ntalRoBERTa, we additionally compare these two\nmodels with ClinicalLongformer, a model trained\non general medical notes instead of MH-related\nReddit data (Figure 5). ClinicalLongformer re-\nverses the trends of the previous two models, pre-\ndicting male words with higher probabilities than\nfemale (14% vs. 10%, p = 0.00, d = 0.63). How-\never, this pattern is consistent across MH prompts\nand non-MH prompts (14% vs. 9%, p = 0.00,\nd = 0.66), suggesting that the model predicts male\nsubjects more frequently in general rather than\nspecifically in mental health contexts. Notably,\nwe find that ClinicalLongformer has the highest\nprobabilities of unspecified-gender words (60%).\nA closer inspection reveals that words like “patient”\nare predicted with high probability.\n4.2 RQ2: Gender Associations with\nDimensions of Mental Health Stigma\nRQ2 aims to explore whether MLMs asymmetri-\ncally correlate gender with individual dimensions\nof mental health stigma. Figure 4 shows primary\nresults and Figure 6 shows additional metrics.\nFemale vs. male association with stigma di-\nmensions. We first examine the probabilities\nof female-gendered phrases and male-gendered\nphrases. For the dimensions of help and avoid-\n2157\nBlameAnger Pity Help\nDangerousness\nFear\nAvoidanceSegregation\nCoercion\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6Probability\nA MentalRoBERTa - MH\nBlameAnger Pity Help\nDangerousness\nFear\nAvoidanceSegregation\nCoercion\nB RoBERTa - MH\nBlameAnger Pity Help\nDangerousness\nFear\nAvoidanceSegregation\nCoercion\nC RoBERTa - non-MH\nMale\nFemale\nFigure 4: Probabilities of RoBERTa (B, C) and MentalRoBERTa (A) for predicting male, female, and unspecified-\ngender words for MH prompts (A, B) and non-MH promts (C). Each subplot shows prompts for nine mental health\nstigma dimensions (3.2). Both models predict male subjects are more likely to be avoided (AVOIDANCE*) and less\nlikely to be helped (HELP**) by the public due to their mental illnesses. MentalRoBERTa significantly predicts\nhigher likelihoods for female subjects to be blamed (BLAME***) about their mental illnesses and to receive more\nanger (ANGER***) from the public due to their illnesses. (***: p < .001, **: p < .01, *:p < .05)\nance10, we find that all three of RoBERTa, Mental-\nRoBERTa, and ClinicalLongformer predict female-\ngendered phrases with higher probabilities ( help:\n11% vs. 7%, p = 0.01, d = 0.6; 10% vs. 4%,\np = 0.00, d = 1.2; 9% vs. 5%, p = 0.01, d = 0.5.\navoidance: 21% vs. 14%, p = 0.02, d = 0.5;\n26% vs. 22%, p = 0.04, d = 0.5; 20% vs. 12%,\np = 0.00, d = 1.2) (Figure 4).\nThus, models do encode these two dimensions\nof stigma – that the public isless likely to help and\nmore likely to avoid men with mental illnesses.\nPsychology research has shown that behaviors of\navoidance and withholding help are highly corre-\nlated, as both are forms of discrimination against\nmen with mental illness (Corrigan et al., 2003).\nOur results confirm that MLMs perpetuate these\nstigma, which can make it even more difficult for\nmen to get help if these biases are propagated to\ndownstream applications.\nEffect of domain-specific pretraining. We next\nanalyze the impact of pretraining data on the mod-\nels’ gendered mental health stigma. As shown\nin Figure 4, MentalRoBERTa is consistent with\nRoBERTa in the dimension ofhelp: male-gendered\nphrases have lower probabilities for these prompts\n(10% vs. 4%, p = 0.00, d = 1.2; 11% vs. 7%,\np = 0.01, d = 0.6), perpetuating the stereotype\nthat men are less likely to receive help for mental\nillness.\n10For the avoidance dimension only, the prompts (para-\nphrased directly from AQ-27) are constructed to indicate less\navoidance, so higher probabilities for a particular gender indi-\ncate being less likely to experience avoidance (Corrigan et al.,\n2003).\nInterestingly, MentalRoBERTa also expresses\nmore stereotypes towards female subjects with\nmental illnesses than RoBERTa. Specifically, Men-\ntalRoBERTa is more likely to generate sentences\nthat blame females for their mental illness, express\nanger towards females with mental illness, and ex-\npress pity for them. (blame: 6% vs. 3%, p = 0.00,\nd = 0.6; anger: 25% vs. 14%, p = 0.00, d = 1.6;\npity: 15% vs. 12%, p = 0.03, d = 0.4) (Fig-\nure 4A).\n5 Discussion\nTheoretical grounding. Blodgett et al. (2020)\npoint out the importance of grounding NLP bias\nresearch in the relevant literature outside of NLP,\nand our study demonstrates such a bias analysis\nframework: our methodology is grounded in social\npsychology literature on mental health, stigma, and\ntreatment-seeking behavior. Some NLP models de-\nveloped to address mental health issues may have\nlimited utility due to a lack of grounding in psy-\nchology research (Chancellor and De Choudhury,\n2020). There is a large body of language-focused\npsychology literature, including many carefully-\nwritten surveys like AQ-27, and as our work shows,\nthis literature can be leveraged for theoretically-\ngrounded NLP research on mental health. In gen-\neral, our framework can be adapted to exploring\nthe intersectional effects of other bias dimensions\nbeyond gender and mental health status.\nTrade-offs, advantages, and disadvantages.\nCrucially, our results do not point to a single model\nthat is “better” than the others. Simply knowing\n2158\nthat models represent one gender more than another\ndoes not imply anything about what their behavior\nshould be. Instead, our results demonstrate that no\nmodel is ideal, and choosing a model must involve\nconsideration of the specific application, especially\nin high-stakes domains like mental health.\nDepending on the downstream application, the\ndifferent aspects of MH stigma explored by RQ1\nand RQ2 may be more or less important. If, for\nexample, a model is being used to create a tool to\nhelp clinicians diagnose people, then perhaps it is\nmore important to consider RQ1 and ensure that the\nmodel does not over-diagnose or under-diagnose\npatient subgroups (e.g., over-diagnosing females\nand under-diagnosing males). On the other hand, if\na model is being used to help generate dialogue for\nmental health support, then the analysis proposed\nin RQ2 might be more relevant. These factors vary\nfrom case to case, and it should be the responsibil-\nity of application developers to carefully examine\nwhat model behaviors are most desirable. Impor-\ntantly, the differences across pretraining corpora\ndemonstrate that simply selecting MentalRoBERTa\nover other models due to its perceived fit for men-\ntal health applications may come with unintended\nconsequences beyond improved performance.\nIntersectionality in bias frameworks. This\nstudy explores intersectionality by jointly consid-\nering gender and mental health status. Intersec-\ntionality originates in Black feminist theory and\nsuggests that different dimensions of a person’s\nidentity interact to create unique kinds of marginal-\nization (Crenshaw, 1990; Collins and Bilge, 2020).\nOur study of gendered mental health stigma is in-\ntersectional in that the privileges and disadvantages\nexperienced by men and women change when we\nalso consider the marginalization experienced by\npeople with mental illness: women are systemi-\ncally disadvantaged in general, but in the context\nof mental health, men tend to be overlooked and\nare faced with harmful social patterns like toxic\nmasculinity (Chatmon, 2020). This intersectional-\nity is operationalized through our methodology that\nexplores the interaction effects of the two variables,\ngender and mental health status.\nWhile we only consider two aspects of iden-\ntity here, and there are many more that can and\nshould be considered in bias research, this work\ndemonstrates the importance of considering the in-\ntersectional aspects most relevant to the domain\nor application at hand. If we had assumed that\nonly women are disadvantaged in mental health\napplications, we would risk perpetuating the pat-\ntern of ignoring men’s mental health, preventing\nthem from receiving care, and perhaps reinforcing\ncertain stereotypes of women – which would harm\nboth men and women. Beyond gender and mental\nhealth, all social biases are nuanced and context-\ndependent. In high-stakes healthcare settings like\nour work, this becomes increasingly critical since\napplications can directly affect the people’s lives.\n5.1 Future Work\nNonbinary and genderqueer identities. Future\nwork should explore genders beyond men and\nwomen, including nonbinary and genderqueer iden-\ntities. Psychology research has shown that peo-\nple with these identities experience uniquely chal-\nlenging mental health risks (Matsuno and Budge,\n2017), so understanding how models encode re-\nlated stigma is ever more important. At a high\nlevel, there is a need for frameworks and methods\nfor studying more diverse genders in language.\nOther intersectional biases. Mental health\nstigma can intersect with many other dimensions\nof identity, such as race, culture, age, and sexual\norientation. Like with gender, understanding how\nthese intersectional biases are represented in mod-\nels is important for developing applications that\nwill not exacerbate existing inequalities in mental\nhealth care. In general, beyond mental health, in-\ntersectionality is an area with many opportunities\nfor continued research.\nIntrinsic and extrinsic harms. Our study ex-\nplores biases intrinsic to MLMs, and these repre-\nsentational harms are harmful on their own (Blod-\ngett et al., 2020), but we do not explore biases that\nsurface in downstream applications. Future work\nshould investigate ways to mitigate such extrin-\nsic biases because they can result in allocational\nharms (Blodgett et al., 2020) if they cause models\nto provide unequal services to different groups.\n6 Conclusion\nOur contributions in this work are threefold. First,\nwe introduce a framework grounded in psychology\nresearch that examines models’ gender biases in\nthe context of mental health stigma. Our methods\nof drawing from psychology surveys, examining\nboth general and attribute-level associations (RQ1\nand RQ2), and developing controlled comparisons\nare reusable in other settings of complex, intersec-\n2159\ntional biases. Second, we present empirical results\nshowing that MLMs do perpetuate societal patterns\nof under-emphasizing men’s mental health: models\ngenerally associate mental health with women and\nassociate stigma dimensions like avoidance with\nmen. This has potential impact for the use of NLP\nin mental health applications and healthcare more\ngenerally. Third, our empirical investigation of gen-\nder and mental health stigma in several different\nmodels shows that training on domain-specific data\ncan reduce stigma in some ways but increase it\nin others. Our study demonstrates the complexity\nof measuring social biases and the importance of\nconsidering multiple dimensions.\nLimitations\nOur work has potential for positive impact in that\nit takes an initial step towards understanding gen-\ndered mental health stigma in language technolo-\ngies. However, our work is limited in a number of\nways. This opens doors for future work, but as prior\nNLP bias works have argued, we caution against\nusing this framework as an off-the-shelf metric to\nevaluate models in practice. Since this study exam-\nines bias in MLMs, all of the limitations we discuss\nin this section are also ethical considerations.\nNonbinary and genderqueer identities and\ngendered word identification. As discussed in § 5,\nintegrating more diverse genders in NLP research\nremains a major gap. Our work’s analyses are like-\nwise limited to binary genders due to the lack of\ngold-standard annotations on language related to\nnonbinary and genderqueer people. In addition,\nour methodology for identifying female, male, or\nunspecified-gender words, especially first names,\nrelies on English Wikipedia data. These sources of\ngender associations are English-language-centric\nand may not be inclusive to marginalized groups.\nMental health prompts. The prompts we man-\nually develop in this work are grounded in psy-\nchology research. We experimented with several\ndifferent paraphrases of each prompt with Quillbot\nto test the robustness of our curation process. How-\never, we acknowledge that our set of prompts is\nstill a limited-sized manually-curated set, and thus\nmay contain artifacts from the curation process or\nfrom the psychology literature we based them off\nof. Similar to gendered word identification, our cu-\nration is based on a psychology survey in standard\nAmerican English. Although the survey itself has\nbeen translated into many other languages and used\noutside of the US, our rephrasing of the survey lan-\nguage may still not be representative of stigma in\nother languages and culture, or even of dialects of\nEnglish like African American English (AAE). Ad-\nditionally, because of the breadth of mental health\ndisorders, our study only constructs prompts from\nthe 11 most common diagnoses. These 11 diag-\nnoses do not span the full spectrum of people’s\nexperiences with mental illness.\nAggregation metrics. Blodgett et al. (2020)\npoint out that aggregated metrics can be problem-\natic when evaluating model biases because they\ncan gloss over differences in model behavior for\ndifferent subpopulations. In this work, we avoid ag-\ngregating scores in many ways and present scores\nbroken down prompt-by-prompt, but our methods\ndo still involve aggregation methods in order to\nsummarize and identify trends in model behaviors.\nFor example, we are not looking at how stigma,\ngender, or gendered stigma may be different from\none diagnosis to the next. This may be an interest-\ning line of future work.\nInterpretability. Our methodology relies on our\ninterpretations of black-box models, and it does\nnot use modern interpretability methods to identify\nwhat aspects of their training data and/or inference-\ntime-input are responsible for model’s decisions\nto generate female, male, or gender-unspecified\nwords. Thus, in this work, we do not concretely\nexamine the effect that training data has on model\nbehavior. In order to do so, we would need to\nquantitatively dive into the training corpora of the\ndifferent models with such interpretability meth-\nods.\nMisuse risk. This work is a preliminary ex-\nploration of gendered mental health stigma, not a\nbenchmark to evaluate models. We do not, and\ncannot, draw conclusions about which models may\nbe better or worse in general or for specific applica-\ntions, for a number of reasons. First, our tests are\nsynthetic: the sentences we have hand-crafted may\nonly represent a subset of how these language mod-\nels actually get used in the real world. Furthermore,\nwe do not explore what concrete impacts (if any)\nthese model behaviors might have in downstream\napplications. Additional research is needed to mea-\nsure these impacts, their actual harmfulness in the\nlived experiences of affected members of society,\nand the trade-offs involved in different applications\nin order to determine what models can and should\nbe used for specific applications.\n2160\nThus, our methodology should not be used as\na metric to evaluate or select models in practice.\nRather, we hope to provide useful insight into how\ngender plays into mental health stigma and how\nlanguage models’ biases depend on specific social\ncontexts like the mental health domain.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Suchin Gururangan, the Tsvetshop lab,\nand the Behavioral Data Science lab at the Univer-\nsity of Washington for the valuable discussions.\nI.W.L., A.S., and T.A. were supported in part\nby NSF grant IIS-1901386, NSF CAREER IIS-\n2142794, NSF grant CNS-2025022, NIH grant\nR01MH125179, Bill & Melinda Gates Founda-\ntion (INV-004841), the Office of Naval Research\n(#N00014-21-1-2154), a Microsoft AI for Acces-\nsibility grant, and a Garvey Institute Innovation\ngrant.
