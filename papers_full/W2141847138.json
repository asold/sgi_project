These authors contributed equally to this work.\nIntroduction\nSex determining gene cascades, from the primary signal to the\nbifunctional switch, are among the most variable developmental\nsystems found in nature [1]. For example, the fruitfly Drosophila\nmelanogaster and mammals both have an XX-XY system, but the\nmechanism that transfers the signal of XX or XY to regulate the\nonset of sex determination is completely different. In mammals,\nthe Y chromosome carries a dominant male determiner, the SRY\ngene [2]. In Drosphila, sex determination is X-chromosome dose\ndependent [3]. Many other Diptera, such as Ceratitis capitata and\nMusca domesticaalso have an XX-XY system, but here the presence\nof an M-factor blocks the default female mode, thereby promoting\nmale development [4,5].\nThe primary signal is processed to regulate sex specific splicing\nof transformer (tra) [4,6–8], termed feminizer (fem) in the honeybee Apis\nmellifera [9]. Female specific tra mRNA yields a functional protein,\nwhile in males, as a result of early in-frame stop codons, a\ntruncated non-functional TRA protein is produced [4,7–11]. Thus\ntra/fem is the central factor in the insect sex determining pathway\n[12]. The principle of tra regulation in diploid insects relies on the\npaternally inherited genome that prevents female specific splicing\nin a variety of ways. In a number of dipteran insects a\nmasculinizing (M) factor is transmitted through males only\n[4,10,13]. In Drosophila the ratio of X-linked signal elements in\nXX animals starts the female specific path of the sex-determining\ncascade by activating Sexlethal (Sxl), an upstream positive regulator\nof tra. In males, that are XY, the relative level of these signals is\ninsufficient to activate Sxl and, hence, tra [3,6]. In Hymenoptera,\nhowever, sex is determined by the ploidy of the embryo: males are\nhaploid, developing from unfertilized eggs whereas diploid females\ndevelop from fertilized eggs. Until recently, knowledge about\nprimary signals in haplodiploid species was limited to comple-\nmentary sex determination (CSD) where gender is determined by\nthe allelic state of the complementary sex determiner (csd) locus or loci\n[14]. CSD has been inferred for more than 60 hymenopterans\n[15]. Only in A. mellifera however, has the csd locus been identified\nand functionally studied. The csd gene (which is a paralog of fem)\nconstitutes the primary signal [16]: heterozygosity at the csd locus\ncauses female specific splicing of fem, which then initiates the\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 May 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e63618\nfemale sex determining route. Homozygosity or hemizygosity at\nthe csd locus leads to maleness. As a number of Hymenoptera,\nincluding Nasonia, do not produce diploid males upon inbreeding\n[17], another mechanism must lie at the basis of haplodiploid sex\ndetermination in these species.\nWe previously showed an alternative mode of haploidiploid sex\ndetermination in Nasonia [11]. In this hymenopteran parasitoid,\nNvtra mRNA is maternally provided to all eggs, similar to what was\nfound in many dipteran insects [4,10,13]. However, only in\nembryos from fertilized eggs is Nvtra transcribed in sufficient\nquantities to initiate and maintain female specific splicing of Nvtra\nby auto regulation, as in all tra or fem fem containing insects, except\nDrosophila ([12] and refs therein). This supported the hypothesis\nthat the mechanism of sex determination in Nasonia is based on\nmaternal silencing of Nvtra by genomic imprinting [17], resulting\nin low expression levels of Nvtra in unfertilized eggs that receive\nonly the maternal genome. Fertilized eggs, that receive a paternal\ngenome without the silencing imprint, show high expression levels\nof Nvtra.\nTwo propositions were presented for the target of imprinting\n[11]. In a direct scenario, the Nvtra gene itself is imprinted during\noogenesis to prevent zygotic transcription in haploid offspring. In\ndiploid offspring, resulting from fertilized eggs, only the non-\nimprinted paternal Nvtra allele is transcribed to produce sufficient\nlevels of Nvtra transcript to maintain auto regulation. Alternatively,\nan activator of the Nvtra gene could be imprinted on the maternal\ngenome to prevent zygotic Nvtra transcription while the non-\nimprinted paternal activator is needed to activate both Nvtra alleles\nin the zygote to be transcribed and maintain Nvtra auto regulation.\nFor diploid early zygotes, the first scenario implies Nvtra\ntranscription from the paternal allele only, while in the second\nscenario Nvtra will be transcribed from both the maternal and\npaternal allele. Which scenario is true can be examined by\ntranscript cloning, using intragenic transcript polymorphisms that\ndistinguish transcripts from the maternal and paternal Nvtra allele.\nOne other way to more directly observe whether maternal\nimprinting at the Nvtra locus itself is responsible for the differences\nin Nvtra mRNA levels between unfertilized versus fertilized\nembryos is to examine the intranuclear patterns of nascent\ntranscription of this gene. It has been shown in Drosophila that\nstrong, distinct spots of signal within nuclei detected by in situ\nhybridization correspond to sites of nascent transcription at\nparticular loci [18]. We have adapted a technique for detecting\nonly nascent transcripts in Nasonia using anti-sense probes against\nintronic sequences.\nHere, we use both approaches and show that Nvtra transcription\noriginates from both the paternal and maternal alleles, indicating\nthat Nvtra is regulated by maternal silencing of a trans-acting factor\ninstead of silencing of Nvtra itself. This result implicates the\nupstream recruitment of a novel gene in the Nasonia sex\ndetermining cascade.\nResults\nQuantitative PCR to Determine Exponential Amplification\nStage\nTo reliably determine the relative contribution of the paternal\nand maternal alleles to zygotic Nvtra transcript levels, RT-PCR\nproducts must originate from the log-linear phase of the PCR\nreaction. In this stage any relative difference between maternal\nand paternal Nvtra transcript levels will be reflected in the relative\nnumber of PCR products, that subsequently can be cloned and\ncounted. Therefore, a quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was\nperformed for each sample. After 22 cycles all samples are within\nor at the end of their log-linear phase, except for two samples that\nare starting in this phase (Figure 1). Therefore 22 cycles were used\nin the PCR step necessary for amplifying the Nvtra transcripts for\ncloning.\nNvtra Expression from the Maternal and Paternal Allele\nThe maternal and paternal Nvtra transcripts can be distin-\nguished by using a Russia Bait strain that harbours an 18 bp\ndeletion in exon one, 237 bp from the ATG startcodon of Nvtra\n(see also [11]). These size differences can be detected by separation\nof Nvtra mRNA RT-PCR products through a 2% non-denaturing\nagarose gel. The ST\nDR strain is a recessive red eye colour mutant\nand does not have this deletion. Cloned RT-PCR fragment\nanalysis showed that one hour old embryos produced by both\nvirgin and mated females contain maternally provided Nvtra\ntranscripts only, by definition originating from the maternal\ngenome. For both virgin and mated females, one hour old\nembryos produced by the Russia Bait females have a 328 bp\nfragment only, while the embryos of the ST\nDR females only have a\n310 bp fragment (Figure 2, lane 1–24, all rows). Seven hour old\nhaploid embryos produced by virgin STDR and Russia Bait\nFigure 1.

In contrast, seven hour old\nembryos produced by mated STDR females as well as mated\nRussia Bait females show Nvtra fragments of 328 bp and 310 bp\n(Figure 2, row E–H, lane 25–48), indicating that the Nvtra\nfragments originate from both the maternal and the paternal allele\nin these diploid embryos. For the STDR females, 38 fragments\nwere observed, of which 17 were of the Russia Bait (R) allele and\n21 from the STDR (S) allele (Table 1). For the reciprocal cross with\nRussia Bait females, in total 34 fragments were observed,\ncontaining 14 R alleles and 20 S alleles (Table 1). Results from\nboth reciprocal crosses do not deviate from the expected 50:50\nratio using a x\n2-test for goodness of fit ( STDR females: p = 0.5164,\nRussia Bait females: p = 0.3035). In some colony PCR samples a\nfragment of 416 bp was observed (for example: Figure 2, row A,\nlane 31–32), indicating a carry over of genomic DNA during RNA\nextraction.\nNascent in situ Hybridisation\nOne would expect that if one of the Nvtra alleles is silenced by\nimprinting, there would be half as many sites of nascent\ntranscription in comparison with a non-imprinted locus. In\naddition, one would expect no or very little zygotic transcription\nfrom the maternally derived Nvtra locus in male embryos. To test\nthese predictions, antisense probes derived from introns of Nvtra\nand the early expressed embryonic patterning gene Nvcad [19]\nwere produced, and used to simultaneously detect nascent\ntranscription in early embryogenesis (syncytial blastoderm stages\nprior to gastrulation), around the time where the difference in\nNvtra levels were shown to diverge strongly between male and\nfemale embryos [11].\nWe observed strong variation from nucleus to nucleus for both\nNvtra and Nvcad. The number of nuclear spots ranged from 0–4 per\nnucleus (see methods) for both genes, and the number of Nvcad and\nNvtra spots were often unequal within any given nucleus. The\ndifference in spots for both genes between haploid and diploid\nembryos is highly significant for both developmental stages (10–11\ncycles Nvtra x\n2 = 41.750, p,0.001; 10–11 cycles Nvcad x2 = 51.562,\np,0.001; 12 cycles Nvtra x2 = 75.690, p,0.001; 12 cycles Nvcad\nx2 = 139.674, p,0.001). This indicates that both the number of\nNvcad and Nvtra spots is dependent on ploidy level. The difference\nbetween Nvcad spots in both nuclear division cycles in diploid\nembryos is significant ( x2 = 21.724, p = 0.04) but the difference in\nNvtra spots is not ( x2 = 10.526, p = 0.570). In haploid embryos the\ndifference of Nvtra or Nvcad spots is significant in both develop-\nmental stages ( Nvtra x2 = 14.230, p = 0.03; Nvcad x2 = 31.625,\np,0.001). Part of this variability in nuclear spots in both\ndevelopmental stages is likely derived from differing mitotic states\nof the nuclei at this very early stage of embryogenesis, where\nmitoses are taking place at approximately 15–20 minute intervals\n(J.A. Lynch, in prep). Another explanation may be some instability\nin upstream inputs into transcription at this early stage of\nembryogenesis, where maternal control of development is giving\nway to zygotic control.\nIn embryos derived from mated females, of which the eggs\nshould be primarily fertilized and yield diploid females, Nvtra\nnascent transcription is first clearly observed in the early\nblastoderm stage (approximately division cycles 10 and 11), where\nit is already strongly expressed (Figure 3A). Despite the observed\nnucleus to nucleus variability, the average number of sites of\ntranscription for Nvtra across multiple nuclei and among multiple\nembryos were indistinguishable to those of Nvcad (x\n2 = 0.457,\np = 0.928, Figure 4A, Table 2). In later embryos (cycle 12), the\nintensity of the Nvtra spots is reduced, as is the variability among\nnuclei (Figure 3B), while the average ratio of Nvtra to Nvcad sites of\ntranscription remained approximately equal ( x2 = 4.378,\np = 0.223, Figure 4B, Table 2). Since Nvcad is expressed from\nboth alleles, this indicates that Nvtra is also expressed from both\nalleles.\nIn embryos derived from virgin females, which will all be\nhaploid males, Nvtra expression is also observed. While our\nmethods for in situ hybridization are not quantitative, the intensity\nof Nvtra nascent transcription appears qualitatively lower in male\nembryos in the early stages (Figure 3C, J.A. Lynch personal\nobservation). However, the number of Nvtra spots in cycle 10–11\nembryos is similar to Nvcad spots ( x\n2 = 0.907, p = 0.341) but\nFigure 4C and Table 2 show that 18.6% of the nuclei with a Nvcad\nspot do not show a Nvtra spot. Embryos that have completed the\nlast syncytial division before gastrulation also have an equal\nnumber of Nvtra nuclear spots compared to Nvcad spots (x2 = 0.383,\np = 0.536) but again Figure 4D and Table 2 show 38.7% of the\nnuclei without a Nvtra spot. Therefore, these results reflect only\nrudimentary Nvtra transcription during the male syncytial devel-\nopment and are in agreement with earlier results [11].\nDiscussion\nUsing transcript cloning it was shown that in seven hour old\ndiploid embryos Nvtra mRNA is transcribed from both parental\nalleles. By nascent in situ hybridization it was shown that in both\nhaploid and diploid embryos the number of Nvtra spots is equal to\nthe number of Nvcad spots, again indicating that Nvtra expression\noccurs from both alleles in diploid embryos. The intensity of Nvtra\nspots is higher in cycle 10–11 diploid embryos than in cycle 12\ndiploid embryos which confirms the earlier observation of a peak\nexpression of Nvtra in diploid embryos [11]. Moreover, in haploid\nembryos the expression levels of Nvtra seem qualitatively lower\nwhen compared to Nvcad expression which also corroborates the\nresults of [11]. However, the nascent in situ hybridisations also\nclearly show that appreciable zygotic transcription of Nvtra occurs\nin haploid embryos which may represent basal transcription levels\nat the Nvtra locus. Still, a high number of nuclei in the haploid\nembryos did not contain a Nvtra spot when compared to the\nnumber of nuclei in diploid embryos without a Nvtra spot (Table 2),\nwhich points at patchy expression of Nvtra in haploid embryos.\nThis may indicate that Nvtra expression in haploid embryos is due\nto leakage because of an incomplete transcription inhibition at the\nNvtra gene. Taken together, these results imply that Nvtra\ntranscription is regulated by a trans-acting factor, that regulates\neither the levels of transcription occurring at the Nvtra locus, the\nstability of the resulting mRNA, or a combination of both. This\nTable 1.Number of maternal and paternal alleles in seven\nhours old embryos.\nSTDR females Russia Bait females\nR allele 17 14\nS allele 21 20\nTotal 38 34\nNumber of Russia alleles (R) andST\nDR alleles (S) in the seven hours old\nembryos samples.

We propose to term this trans-acting factor womanizer (wom)\n(Figure 5). This addition to the Nasonia sex determining cascade is\nin agreement with the theoretical considerations of [20] that sex\ndetermining cascades can rapidly change by adding new\ncomponents to the upstream levels owing to sexual selection.\nWithin the Hymenoptera this evolutionary process is visible when\ncomparing Nasonia to Apis mellifera. It was shown in A. mellifera that\nthe csd gene is the result of a duplication of fem, and evolved to\nregulate the sex specific splicing of fem in early development [21].\nIn Nasonia the proposed wom locus evolved to regulate Nvtra\nexpression differentially between fertilized and unfertilized em-\nbryos. Between species in the order of Diptera, the regulation of tra\nis also very different, most notably Drosophila where Sex-lethal was\nadded to the sex determining cascade to regulate tra expression\n[22]. In addition, the M-factors in Ceratitis capitata [4] and Musca\ndomestica [5] regulate tra in an different way by inhibiting tra\ntranscription or translation.\nThe results shown here are in agreement with the maternal\neffect genomic imprinting sex determination (MEGISD) model as\nhas been suggested by [17] and are an important addition to the\nfindings of [11] on the prominent maternal role in Nasonia sex\ndetermination. The current results also explain a number of\nimportant previous observations on sex determination in Nasonia.i )\nA polyploid mutant strain has been described in which females are\ntriploid and lay haploid and diploid eggs that normally develop\ninto males when unfertilized [23]. The occurence of triploid\nfemales that produce diploid males means that we can rule out a\nploidy effect in which the number of chromosome sets somehow\nregulate Nvtra expression. ii) [24] generated rare diploid male\noffspring from X-ray mutagenized wild type haploid males. These\nbiparental diploid males were explained by an imprinting defect in\nthe irradiated paternal germ line generating an epigenetic lesion.\nFigure 2.

After\nfertilization it causes the loss of the paternal genome in the early\nzygote resulting in male development [25–27]. Our model\nexplains why PSR leads to male development: since the paternal\ngenome is condensed quickly after fertilization wom cannot act,\nagain resulting in insufficient levels of Nvtra expression. iv) The\nobservation of uniparental haploid females and gynandromorphs\nby [23] can be explained by improper maternal imprinting of wom\nleading to zygotic transcription of Nvtra in haploid individuals.\nDepending on the level of improper imprinting, this would lead to\neither complete or partial female development of these haploid\nindividuals [28]. We cannot rule out that the proposed gyn1 locus\n[29] and the wom locus are the same.\nThe mechanism of maternal silencing of wom is as yet unknown.\nSince DNA methylation has been implicated in gene silencing in\ninsects [30] it is attractive to speculate DNA methylation to be\ninvolved in the maternal silencing of wom. Nasonia possesses a\ncomplete gene set of DNA methyltransferases [31] and the\nimportance of maternal provision of DNA methyltransferase\nDnmt1a in early embryonic development has already been reported\n[32].\nTaken together, our results show that Nasonia female sex\ndetermination is dependent on zygotic activation of Nvtra\nexpression by an as yet unknown factor, that we propose to term\nwomanizer (wom). This factor, wom is maternally silenced upon\noogenesis to ensure male development in unfertilized eggs.\nMaterials and Methods\nNasonia Strains\nThe N. vitripennis lab strains AsymCx, STDR, and a Russia Bait\nstrain, originally collected near Moscow (Russia) were used\nthroughout the experiments. All strains have been cured from a\nWolbachia infection, cultured under constant light at 25\n0\nC and\nreared on Calliphora sp. fly pupae as hosts.\nEmbryo Collection forNvtra Fragment Analysis\nApproximately 50 STDR adult females were individually mated\nto Russia Bait males, and vice versa. They were provided with\nhosts in egg laying chambers that restricts access of the female to\nonly the anterior part of the fly pupa which greatly facilitates\nembryo collection. Individual hosting of the mated females also\nleads to strongly female biased offspring [33]. In addition, virgin\nST\nDR and Russia Bait females were set up individually to produce\nmale offspring only, which is used as control for the presence or\nabsence of the deletion in the Russia Bait or STDR strain,\nrespectively. Females were allowed to feed on one host for 24\nhours to stimulate oogenesis, after which they were given a new\nhost for one hour at 25\n0\nC that was used for embryo collection. For\nFigure 3. Nascent transcription ofNvtra compared to that ofNvcad. Nuclear spots ofNvtra (green) and Nvcad (red) reveal that there is no\napparent imprinting of either theNvcad or Nvtra locus in early (A) or late (B) blastoderm stage female embryos. In male embryos (C,D) there is\nmoderately less Nvtra expression in early blastoderm stage (C), and significantly less in late blastoderm stage (D).\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0063618.g003\nNvtra Expression Is Regulated by a New Component\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 5 May 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e63618\none hour old embryo samples, embryos were collected immedi-\nately and stored in 100% ethanol within 15 minutes. For seven\nhour old embryo samples, the hosts were incubated for another six\nhours at 25\n0\nC, after which the embryos were collected in a similar\nway. After collection the embryo samples were stored at {80\n0\nC\nuntil RNA extraction. In total six replicates of one hour old\nembryos and six replicates of seven hour old embryos were\ncollected from mated ST\nDR and mated Russia Bait females.\nAdditionally, six replicates of 100 one hour old embryos and six\nreplicates of 100 seven hour old embryos were collected from\nvirgin ST\nDR or Russia Bait females.\nRNA Extraction, cDNA Synthesis and Quantitative Real-\ntime PCR\nRNA extraction was performed with TriZol according to\nmanufacturers protocol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA);\nduring the precipitation step 15 mg GlycoBlueTM (Ambion, Austin,\nTexas, USA) was used to facilitate precipitation of RNA. All\nisolated total RNA was primed using a mixture of 1:6 random\noligo-dT:random hexamers, both provided with the RevertAid\nTM\nH Minus First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentas, Hanover,\nMD, USA) and reverse transcribed. The resulting cDNA was\ndiluted 1:100. One ml of this diluted cDNA was used to check the\nintegrity and quality of the cDNA conversion with PCR using\n400 nM NvTra_poly_F1 (5 9-GGATTGCTTGGATGGTACAG-\n39) and NvTra_poly_R1 (5 9-TGGATGTTCACTA-\nCAACTTGTC-39) with with 95\n0\nC for 3 min, 40 cycles of 95\n0\nC\nfor 15 s, 57\n0\nC for 30 s and 72\n0\nC for 30 s.\nFor quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), one ml of 1:100 diluted\ncDNA was mixed with 12.5 ml ABgene ABsolute TM QPCR\nSYBRH Green ROX (500 nM) Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific,\nGermany) and 200 nM of primers NvTra_poly_F1 and NvTra_-\npoly_R1. A standard ABI7300 dissociation curve was applied to\ncheck for non-specific amplification.\nRT-PCR Amplification ofNvtra Transcript\nThe primers NvTra_poly_F1 and NvTra_poly_R1 give a\nfragment of 328 bp in case of Nvtra cDNA without the deletion,\n310 bp in case of Nvtra cDNA with the deletion and 416 bp or\n398 bp on genomic DNA [11]. All fragments are confirmed by\nSanger sequencing and can be distinguished on a 2% non-\ndenaturing agarose gel containing 0.5 mg/ml ethidium bromide.\nFigure 4. Number of spots ofNvtra and Nvcad counted in a given number of nuclei (%).Nuclei containing only aNvcad spot are included.\nDistribution ofNvtra (black bars) orNvcad (grey bars) spots in 10–11 cycle female embryos are equal indicating thatNvtra and Nvcad expression are\nsimilar (A). Some variation in the amount of spots is seen which is due to the nuclear division at that stage. In cycle 12 nuclear division is complete (B)\nand both Nvtra and Nvcad show primarily diploid expression. In 10–11 cycle male embryos (C) this variation due to nuclear division is also present\nand after division in cycle 12Nvtra shows haploid expression similar toNvcad (D). In male embryos (C, D) the number of nuclei without aNvtra spot is\nhigher than in female embryos (A, B).\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0063618.g004\nNvtra Expression Is Regulated by a New Component\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 6 May 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e63618\nFrom the eight sample classes each replicate was used four times\nin a PCR reaction with similar parameters as described for the\nqPCR. In this way any bias of PCR amplification is averaged over\nfour PCR runs. One ml 1:100 diluted cDNA was mixed with 10x\nPCR buffer (Roche) (10x concentrate; 100 mM Tris-HCl,\n500 mM KCl; pH 8.3), 200 mM dNTPs, 2 units Taq polymerase\n(Roche), 400 nM of primers NvTra_poly_F1 and NvTra_poly_R1\nand supplemented with milliQ water to 25 ml. PCR profile was as\nfollows: initial denaturing step of 95\n0\nC for 3 min, followed by 20\ncycles of 95\n0\nC for 15 s, 57\n0\nC for 30 s and 72\n0\nC for 30 s, ending\nwith a final extension step of 72\n0\nC for 7 min. As negative control\none ml of milliQ water was used. Since the amount of product was\ntoo low to visualize on gel, all six replicates for each sample class\nwere pooled and one ml of this was used in a similar PCR regime\nas above but with 40 cycles. In this way the samples could be\nchecked for improper amplification and possible contaminations\non a 2% non-denaturing agarose gel with 0.5 mg/ml ethidium-\nbromide. The negative control samples from the 22 cycles PCR\nwere also used in this PCR as templates to check for reagent and\nwater contaminations.\nCloning PCR Fragments\nFor each PCR reaction, the six replicate samples were pooled,\nso that each sample class consisted of four samples, that were\nsubsequently purified using the GeneJET PCR Purification Kit\n(Fermentas, Hanover, MD, USA) to remove primers, nucleotides\nand salt. After PCR clean up, samples were checked again for\nimproper amplification using a 40 cycles PCR as described above.\nUsing a nanodrop2000 (Nanodrop, Wilmington, DE, USA) the\npurity and concentration of each sample was determined. The four\nsamples, per sample class, were pooled, resulting in one sample for\neach of the eight sample classes. Approximately 10 ng of each\nsample was ligated into a pGEM H ~{{T vector (Promega, Madison,\nWI, USA) according to manufacturers protocol. JM-109 E. coli\n(efficiency: 1610\n8 cfu/mg DNA) cells that were supplied with the\npGEMH ~{{T Vector System II (Promega, Madison, WI, USA)\nwere transformed with five ml of ligation reaction, and plated onto\n2xYT, 100 mg/ml ampicillin, 80mg/ml X-gal, 0.5 mM IPTG, agar\nplate. These plates were incubated for 16 hours at 37\n0\nC and stored\nat 4\n0\nC for 2 hours to facilitate blue/white screening. Forty white\ncolonies and four blue colonies from each sample point were\npicked up and used in a colony PCR as described in the section\nabove. The resulting PCR fragments were visualized on a 2%\nagarosegel with 1x TBE buffer with 0.5 mg/ml ethidiumbromide.\nx\n2 tests of goodness of fit were performed in Microsoft Excel.\nNascent Transcript in situ Hybridisation\nFor in situ hybridisations, the reference gene N. vitripennis caudal\n(Nvcad) was chosen as comparison for Nvtra expression, because it\nhas a strong, and initially broad early zygotic domain of expression\n[19].\nFragments of Nvcad and Nvtra introns were isolated using the\nfollowing primers:\nN nvtraintF1 ggccgcggTACGCTCAGGTGCTAACTGC\nN nvtraintR1 cccggggcTTTATGCATGAATGGCCAAC\nN nvcadintF ggccgcggCAAGCCGTTCTCCCATTAAA\nN nvcadintR cccggggcACAGCGAAAAACGAGAGGAA\nThese fragments were then used as the basis for in situ\nhybridization probe synthesis. AsymCx wasps were allowed to\nlay eggs in a Waspinator chamber (J.A. Lynch, in prep) for 3 hours\nat 29\n0\nC. Eggs were then aged for two hours and immediately\nfixed, and hand dechorionated by the method of [34]. The\ndevelopmental stages present in this population of embryos\noverlaps those used for the PCR based analysis of Nvtra expression.\nIn situ hybridizations were performed with a standard protocol\nwith some minor modifications (detailed protocol can be obtained\non request from the authors (J.A. Lynch)). Digoxigenin (dig)\nlabeled probes were detected using an anti-dig::POD antibody\n(1:100) followed by fluorescent amplification using the AlexaFluor\n488 tyramide kit from Life technologies. Dinitrophenyl (DNP)\nlabeled probes were detected with rabbit anti-DNP antibody\n(1:300) followed by an anti-rabbit Alexa 568 labelled secondary\nantibody (1:500). Embryos were mounted in Vectashield with\nDAPI. Images shown were produced using a dig labelled Nvtra\nintron probe in combination with a DNP N. vitripennis caudal(Nvcad)\nprobe. Experiments where the labels were exchanged gave similar\nresults.\nCounting Nuclear Dots\nConfocal images of stained embryos were obtained using a Zeiss\nLSM 710 microscope using the Zen software package. Sections\nwere flattened into projections using the Standard Deviation\nprojection function in Image J. Projections of each channel were\noverlaid and adjusted for contrast in Adobe Photoshop. Twenty-\nfive to thirty-five nuclei from each embryo were analyzed. Nuclei\nthat had more than the expected maximum number (4, for diploid\nembryos where S-phase of mitosis has been completed) of spots for\neither gene were excluded from analysis. Such nuclei were\ninfrequent, and likely arose due to technical artifacts, or due to\nthe presence of large aggregates of mRNA that do not represent\nnascent transcription, but rather some other regulatory process\nacting on completely transcribed mRNAs (such as regulated\nFigure 5. Overview of the different sex determining mecha-\nnisms in Diptera and Hymenoptera.

Other Diptera (e.g.C. capitata, M. domestica)\nhave a M-factor usually on the Y-chromosome that blocks tra auto\nregulation [4,10]. A. mellifera has a complementary sex determiner(csd)\nthat splices fem [21] and Nasonia has womanizer (wom) that regulates\ntra expression.
