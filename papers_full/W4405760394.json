  "abstract": "Sentiment analysis via artificial intelligence, i.e., machine learning and large language models (LLMs), is a pivotal tool that classifies sentiments within texts as positive, negative, or neutral. It enables computers to automatically detect and interpret emotions from textual data, covering a spectrum of feelings without direct human intervention. Sentiment analysis is integral to marketing research, helping to gauge consumer emotions and opinions across various sectors. Its applications span analyzing movie reviews, monitoring social media, evaluating product feedback, assessing employee sentiments, and identifying hate speech. This study explores the application of both traditional machine learning and pre-trained LLMs for automated sentiment analysis of customer product reviews. The motivation behind this work lies in the demand for more nuanced understanding of consumer sentiments that can drive data-informed business decisions. In this research, we applied machine learning-based classifiers, i.e., Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine, alongside the GPT-4 model to benchmark their effectiveness for sentiment analysis. Traditional models show better results and efficiency in processing short, concise text, with SVM in classifying sentiment of short length comments. However, GPT-4 showed better results with more detailed texts, capturing subtle sentiments with higher precision, recall, and F1 scores to uniquely identify mixed sentiments not found in the simpler models. Conclusively, this study shows that LLMs outperform traditional models in context-rich sentiment analysis by not only providing accurate sentiment classification but also insightful explanations. These results enable LLMs to provide a superior tool for customer-centric businesses, which helps actionable insights to be derived from any textual data.",
