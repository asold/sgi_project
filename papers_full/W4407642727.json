  "abstract": "Smart cities are Hyper-Connected Digital Environments (HCDEs) that transcend the boundaries of natural, human-made, social, virtual, and artificial environments. Human activities are no longer confined to a single environment as our presence and interactions are represented and interconnected across HCDEs. The data streams and repositories of HCDEs provide opportunities for the responsible application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that generates unique insights into the constituent environments and the interplay across constituents. The translation of data into insights poses several complex challenges originating in data generation and then propagating through the computational layers to decision outcomes. To address these challenges, this article presents the design and development of a Hyper-Automated AI framework with Generative AI agents for sustainable smart cities. The framework is empirically evaluated in the living lab setting of a ‘University City of the Future’. The developed AI framework is grounded on the core capabilities of acquisition, preparation, orchestration, dissemination, and retrospection, with an independent cognitive engine for hyper-automation of these AI capabilities using Generative AI. Hyper-automation output feeds into a human-in-the-loop process prior to decision-making outcomes. More broadly, this framework aims to provide a validated pathway for university cities of the future to take up the role of prototypes that deliver evidence-based guidelines for the development and management of sustainable smart cities.",
