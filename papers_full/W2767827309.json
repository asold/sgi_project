For example,\ndevelopmental studies on human infants indicate that children have difficulties inserting an\nelongated object into a slot of similar length before the age of 22 months [1]. Older children\nstart rotating the object into the proper position before bringing it into contact with the slot,\nindicating that vision plays an important role in their shape-frame matching abilities [1].

How-\never, they succeeded when the disc was pre-aligned prior to insertion, suggesting that children\nbelow the age of 2 have more trouble orienting an object in relation to a substrate than orient-\ning a part of their own body. This is largely because human and non-human animals use two\ndifferent spatial frames of reference when moving parts of their own body (e.g. a hand) or\nobjects in space: when using an egocentric frame of reference, we move objects relative to our\nown body, and when using an allocentric one we use environmental objects as landmarks for\norientation [3, 4]. Moving an object relative to other objects/substrates, as required when\ninserting an object into a matching frame is considered to be harder than moving it in relation\nto one’s own body. Humans start to develop an allocentric frame of reference in the first year\nof their life, but it improves over a period of several years [5]. Throughout human ontogeny,\nthe improvement of an allocentric frame of reference is also closely linked to the development\nof tool use [6]. It is likely that being able to use an allocentric frame of reference is an impor-\ntant prerequisite for the development of flexible tool use in animals as well [7].\nAnother important aspect of shape-frame matching is geometry, as it imposes the number\nof relations that must be managed simultaneously: a circular object has only one point of refer-\nence, whereas a stick-like object with an axis has at least four points that need to be taken into\naccount: two defining the axis of the object and two defining the axis of the groove [7]. Fur-\nthermore, a lower degree of symmetry adds to the complexity of the task: a circle has infinite\nsides of symmetry all going through its centre, a square-shaped object has four sides of symme-\ntry, whereas an equal sided triangle has only three. Hence, in the case of the circular object, as\nlong as you place it in the center of the opening, its orientation does not matter. The square\nhowever has 4 possible correct orientations for each front side (turning the object 90˚ to\nachieve insertion, and 8 correct orientations turning the object 180˚ etc.), whereas the front\nside of a triangle has only 3 (it needs to be turned up to 120˚, 6 correct orientations when\nturned 180˚). Correspondingly, according to the Bayley Scales of Infant Development [8], a\nwidely used tool to assess children’s mental, motor and language skills, human infants can\ninsert a ball in a circular opening at 1 year of age, but can only insert a cube into a square open-\ning when they are almost 2 years old. Even more complex are asymmetrical objects, because\nthey can only be inserted in one way and the number of axes that need to be managed relative\nto the groove is determined by the number of object features added [7, 9]. Fragaszy et al. [9]\ntested a setup on human infants, in which up to 2 features were added to a single rectangular\ngroove and a matching object: They found that 2, 3 and 4-year-old children consistently\naligned a bar-shaped stick and a cross-shaped stick (with one long and one short axis at the\ntop), but had difficulty aligning a tomahawk-shaped stick to a corresponding substrate groove.\nThe two older age classes routinely held the objects above the cutout, comparing it visually\nbefore attempting to align it, again suggesting that they did use vision to facilitate their shape-\nframe matching. When habitually tool using primates, namely capuchin monkeys and chim-\npanzees, were tested using the same setup [7], both species aligned the long axis of the bar-\nshaped object with the matching groove more often than expected by chance but with poor\nprecision. Some individuals within both species managed to align the second axis in the cross\ncondition, with subjects making 4 times as many placement-attempts to succeed in the latter\nalignment than in the original bar condition. Only one capuchin monkey achieved above-\nchance success at matching 3 features in the tomahawk condition with the corresponding cut-\nouts. Although they do seem to be able to align simple object shapes such as the bar in an effi-\ncient manner, habitually tool using primates seemed to perform relatively poorly at this task\nand apparently lack the visual object guidance of even a 2-year-old human despite having been\nshown to possess considerable hand-eye coordination [10]. As the above experiment is to our\nknowledge the only study investigating shape-frame matching in any non-human, we do not\nShape match ing in Goffin’s cockatoos\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.01868 59 November 8, 2017 2 / 19\nyet know whether it evolved as a by-product of digital dexterity in primates or whether it can\nalso develop convergently in other species.\nAlthough most parrots, except for the black Palm cockatoo (Probosciger aterrimus) [11,12]\nare not known to be using tools habitually on a population wide level in the wild, many parrot\nspecies playfully insert objects into substrate openings [13–15]. Conspicuously, the pet indus-\ntry offers various enrichment toys specifically for parrots that resemble simple fitting tasks for\nhuman children. During an experiment on object play [14] featuring various differently\nshaped objects, we were able to repeatedly observe Goffin’s cockatoos (Cacatua goffiniana) car-\nrying and inserting objects into substrate features inside the aviary that composed nearly an\nexact frame around the object (S1 Fig). They did so lacking any previous re-enforcement or\ntraining. Furthermore, studies on Goffin’s cockatoos indicate the capacity for complex forms\nof tool use and manufacture through innovation in captivity [16] and arguably in a few feral\nindividuals according to unpublished data by Osuna-Mascaro & Auersperg. The tool use of\ncaptive individuals is flexibly adjusted depending on the problem at hand [17–19]. Thus, this\nallows us to investigate shape-frame matching in both unrewarded as well as tool-using con-\ntexts for the first time in a non-primate model. Using a series of experiments, we aim to look\ninto several aspects of the shape-frame matching abilities of the Goffin’s cockatoo.\nIn a first instance, we are interested in the behaviour within the context of unrewarded\nobject play. We would like to determine the rate of reoccurrence of playful shape-frame match-\ning and whether this particular type of object play is restricted to specific object shapes and/or\nto certain individuals. Due to our previous observations a few years ago, we predict that cocka-\ntoos will playfully match shapes to frames irregularly and that they will match highly symmet-\nrical shapes such as circles more often than less symmetrical shapes in this context.\nFurthermore, we aim to test shape-frame matching in a tool using context using a\nbox featuring several different types of ‘keyholes’ that allow for the insertion of only one out of\na selection of 3 or 5 object shapes (‘keys’). The keyholes have different levels of symmetry and\ndifferently shaped features.\nWithin this tool use task, we first want to look at tool selection: Are the birds able to select\nthe correct tool for the keyhole at hand and is performance spontaneous or is there a learning\nprocess involved? Whereas the cockatoos have been shown to react flexibly and sensibly in a\ntool selection task featuring two very different tasks [19], learning a simple virtual matching to\nsample task on the touch screen was a long and tedious process which did not lead to success\nin many cases [20]. If the birds are able to select the objects that corresponded to the correct\nframes, it would indicate that adding physical context to a matching to sample task increases\nperformance, as has been shown in a few other species, e.g. Kea (Nestor notabilis) [21], Pigeons\n(Columba livia) [22] and humans [23]. In the second aspect of the keybox task we are inter-\nested in the effect of object/frame geometry on insertion success/effort. We would like to estab-\nlish if the animals only succeed when inserting specific shapes, and within the successful\nshapes which geometric forms cause most difficulty. Based on previous results on human\ninfants and primates [7, 9] we expect the animals to follow insertion patterns as predicted for\nthe unrewarded object play experience. Finally, we would like to assess the effect of shape-\nframe matching experience during object play on their performance in the keybox task. One of\nthe benefits of object play is in many cases speculated to be practicing the neuro-muscular sys-\ntem for enhanced performance when confronted with future foraging problems [24, 25], how-\never this has rarely been tested systematically. Demery & Chappell [26] tested Senegal parrots’\n(Poicephalus senegalus) and kakarikis’ (Cyanoramphus novaezelandiae) sensitivity to a change\nof visible (colour, shape) and invisible (weight) cues during object exploration. Both species\nexplored functional and invisible changes more than non-functional or visible ones, and inter-\nestingly, asymmetrical objects more than symmetrical ones. Because object play presents\nShape match ing in Goffin’s cockatoos\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.01868 59 November 8, 2017 3 / 19\nanimals with an opportunity to explore objects’ physical properties, we therefore predict an\neffect of previous object play experience on both the performance in selecting the appropriate\ntool as well as on insertion efficiency.\nMaterials and methods\nSubjects\n13 adult, captive- born and hand-reared Goffin’s cockatoos (Cacatua goffiniana), participated\nin this study.\nThe subjects (8 males, 5 females) were kept in a single-species group at the Goffin Lab of\nthe University of Veterinary Medicine (Vienna, Austria) and were housed in a large, enriched\naviary with an indoors and outdoors area (in total ca. 200 m\n2\nground, space up to 6m high).\nAll parrots were kept on an ad libitum diet (fresh and dried fruits, boiled vegetables, a mixture\nof boiled and raw seeds and fresh water). For further information about the subjects see S1\nTable.\nExperimental history. All subjects had previously been involved in various physical prob-\nlem-solving tasks [27, 28], including studies involving the use of tools [16–19, 29]. Addition-\nally, five years before the data collection started, in the summer of 2011, all (except for birds\nhatched in 2011) participated in a monitoring study on object play in which some shape\nmatching actions were accidentally observed in an unrewarded context [13] (S1 Fig). However,\nthey had not experienced the objects and their respective negatives (shaped holes correspond-\ning to the objects) used in this experiment.\nEthical note. All animals are permanently kept (before and after the experiment) in a\nwell-established group at the “Goffin Lab”. All have CITES certificates and were registered at\nthe district’s administrative animal welfare bureau (Bezirkshauptmannschaft St. Po ¨ lten\nSchmiedgasse 4–6, A-3100, St. Po ¨ lten, Austria). Our housing conditions comply with the Aus-\ntrian Federal Act on the Protection of Animals (Animal Protection Act—§24 Abs. 1 Z 1 and 2;\n§25 Abs. 3—TSchG, BGBl. I Nr. 118/2004 Art. 2). As our experiments are strictly non-invasive\nand based purely on behavioural observations, they are not classified as animal experiments in\naccordance with Austrian Law (Austria: §2. Federal Law Gazette No. 501/1989) and do not\nrequire permission. The birds are not wing-clipped and only enter the experimental room on a\nvoluntary basis. Our animals are never food deprived and are closely monitored on a daily\nbasis; no elevated levels of stress or aggression could be detected throughout our testing\nperiod.\nUnrewarded shape matching\nIn the Unrewarded Shape Matching (USM) section of this study we tested the propensity of\nour subjects to playfully establish unrewarded shape-matching relationships between objects.\nThis monitoring block additionally served as pre-experience for 7 of the 13 birds in order to\nassess a possible effect of enhanced play experience on later task performance, which was con-\nducted immediately after the monitoring block had ended.\nDuring testing, the 7 subjects were visually isolated from the remaining group and exposed\nto different playsets (Fig 1).\nEach playset consisted of yellow wooden substrate boards with either indentions and their\ncorrespondingly shaped free objects, or poles and discs with the corresponding negatives (see\nFig 1 for dimensions). The substrate boards were placed next to each other in random order\nand the objects were scattered around (or pre-stacked/inserted upon/into; see phase 2) them.\nThe wooden playsets were offered in three consecutive phases: in phase 1, the shaped objects\nwere all scattered around the substrates (shaped poles or holes); in phase 2 one set of objects\nShape match ing in Goffin’s cockatoos\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.01868 59 November 8, 2017 4 / 19\nwas pre-stacked/pre-ins erted onto/into the poles/holes to enhance unstacking behaviour; dur-\ning phase 3, the subjects received one stacking/unstacking demonstration by a human demon-\nstrator for each substrate (pole/hole) in random order before receiving the setup as in phase 1.\nSubjects were free to interact with each playset (in the same order A, B, C) in an unrewarded\ncontext (each phase consisting of 5 sessions, which lasted for 30 minutes in phases 1 and 2, and\n10 minutes in phase 3 respectively)\nWithin all phases, we scored the frequencies of object-substrate (poles/holes) combinations.\nWithin the latter, three distinctions were made: ‘incorrect’ (combined shapes do not match);\n‘correct’ (combined shapes match but are not fully stacked/ inserted) and successful ‘shape-\nmatch’ (correct object is successfully stacked/inserted).\nThe keybox\nApparatus and material. The keybox apparatus (see Fig 2 for dimensions) was made\nfrom hard beech wood. It had three wooden sides, a Plexiglas\n1\nroof and was screwed onto a\nwooden plate. We used 8 exchangeable Plexiglas\n1\nwalls in total, because similar shapes as in\nthe USM part were divided into keyset A (3 keys) and keyset B (5 keys; see description in Fig\n2). Correspondingly, 3 walls featured ‘keyholes’ corresponding to the shapes of keyset A, and 5\nwith the shapes of keyset B; the contour of the keyholes were highlighted with black permanent\nmarker. These walls could be slid into guide rails in place of the fourth side and were secured\nby wood chips between the wall and the roof. Inside the box, a collapsible platform was affixed\nhalfway up the back wall and was held horizontally by a magnet, whose strength was set in a\nway that any inserted key would cause the platform to collapse. The keys were molded using\nyellow Fimo\n1\nclay (with each the same amount of small lead balls inside to increase the\nweight, approximately 10 grams) and later baked at 130˚C to harden. In order for a specific\nkey to only fit through its respective wall, the keys within keyset B were thickened at their\nbases (the centre of the shape) and the bases had different diameters (Fig 2; S2 Fig).\nProcedure. The keybox test series tested for correct tool selection and shape-matching\nabilities as a means to retrieve food from a box. It consisted of a short training phase followed\nby a testing phase. For all tests, the individual subjects were visually isolated from their conspe-\ncifics when placed into an experimental compartment. During the training phase, birds were\ngiven the opportunity to insert a small, randomly shaped natural stone into a Plexiglas\n1\nwall\nFig 1. The 3 playsets (a-c) with dimensions. Two of each object shape were offered alongsid e the poles or\nindents for each set.

Birds were tested until they\nretrieved the food on each trial for two consecutive sessions of 10 trials each, with trials lasting\na maximum of 10 minutes before testing was discontinued and a new session was started on\nthe following day (note that subjects had pre-experience inserting compact objects into tubes\nfrom Laumer et al. [19] and thus had little problems in the transfer).\nDuring the first keybox task, all subjects were presented with keyset A (6 sessions à 12 trials)\nand keyset B (12 sessions à 10 trials) together with the apparatus. Within each session (12 tri-\nals) of keyset A (3 keys), each of the 3 exchangeable walls would be placed into the keybox 4\ntimes (in random order), and within each session (10 trials) of keyset B (5 keys) each wall\nwould be placed into the keybox twice. Hence, each key was the correct choice a total of 24\ntimes throughout the experiment. For both keysets, half of the sessions were first presented as\na ‘Spontaneous Choice Condition’: As soon as the bird combined a key with the Plexiglas\n1\nfront of the keybox, the remaining keys were immediately removed. If subjects chose the\nFig 2. Top: Basic apparatus with dimensions; Bottom: Exchang eable Plexiglas walls with different\nkeyholes and correspon ding keys.

If they chose an incorrect key, they had to wait 3 minutes before the next trial\nstarted. If a bird failed to choose a key within 10 minutes, the trial was terminated. Thereafter,\nthe keys were presented in a ‘Learning Condition’: All keys remained on the table for a period\nof 10 minutes or until the food was retrieved, allowing the subject to try out different key com-\nbinations within the same trial.\nIn very few instances, birds either managed to forcefully squeeze a key through a non-\nmatching hole or moved the keybox itself so that the platform collapsed. These cases were not\ncounted as successful, the reward was removed immediately and the trial was terminated.\nThe keybox was baited out of sight with a piece of cashew nut and thereafter placed onto an\nexperimental table (70x70cm). The subject was placed on the backrest of a chair in front the\napparatus. After a five second delay, during which the bird had the chance to look at the\nrespective Plexiglas\n1\nwall in the keybox, all keys of the corresponding keyset were placed on\nthe table in a straight line ca. 30 cm parallel to the front of the keybox in random order from\nleft to right. After a second delay of 10 seconds, during which the bird could look at both the\nkeys and the wall, the bird was allowed to pick a key. The experimenter stood behind the cam-\nera, wore mirrored sunglasses and avoided lateral head movement throughout the entire test-\ning phase.\nThe data for the USM was collected between March 2015 and October 2015 and for the\nkeybox test series between November 2015 and June 2016.\nAnalysis\nAll trials were videotaped (JVC Camcorder Model No.: GZ-HM30BE) and coded in situ\nas well as from the videos. We counted all object combinations with the substrate grooves\nin the USM. Within all object combinations we highlight combinations of objects with the\ncorrect frame and actual shape matches. In the keybox test we scored the first object that\nwas combined with the front of the keybox as correct/non-correct; whether the subject\nwas successful in retrieving the food from the platform in this trial, if any objects and\nhow many were lifted before one was combined with the frame (‘switch’) for each keyset (A\n& B). Furthermore, in trials in which the correct object was used, we scored the duration\nfrom the first contact between the object and the box to the insertion (‘duration’) and the\nnumber of times it was brought in contact with the opening (‘combination frequency’). The\nlatter two scorings were only conducted for condition 1 in order to look at spontaneous\nperformance.\nUnrewarded shape matching. We conducted General Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) in\nSPSS (Version 24) for each playset (A, B & C) in USM on ‘mean number of correct combina-\ntions’ and ‘mean number of shape matches’ as target variables.

As it was not possible to reliably score the exact alignment of\nthe object features with the keyhole (the birds were often blocking the full sight towards the\nkeyhole with their body), we decided to use duration and frequency of combinations in order\nto obtain a measure on which shapes caused most difficulties during insertions. For trials in\nwhich the correct object was selected, we conducted GLMMs on mean duration (in seconds;\nfirst contact of object with keybox to insertion) and on mean frequency (number of times the\nobject was brought into contact with the opening before successful insertion). Random factor\nwas ‘individual’, fixed factors were ‘group’ (play experience or not) ‘key’, ‘condition’ (condi-\ntion1 and 2), ‘session’ and an interaction ‘group\n\u0003\nkey’\nWe used Wilcoxon signed rank and Mann-Whitney U tests for posthoc analysis, and\nBinominal tests to assess individual data. We used the Bonferroni-Holms method to control\nfor multiple comparisons.\nWe controlled for inter-observer reliability by double-scoring of 10% of the data by a naïve\ncoder. The inter-rater correlation coefficient (ICC) suggests perfect agreement between the\ntwo raters for (all ICCs >0.9, S2 Table) in all relevant measures.\nResults\nUnrewarded shape matching\nFor playsets A-C subjects did not combine the object with their corresponding substrate\ngrooves above chance expectation (One-Sample Wilcoxon tests N = 7, p<0.05). Nevertheless,\nfor playsets A and C, the factors ‘phase’ and ‘object’ and, for playset B, the factor ‘phase’ but\nnot any other factors measured had a significant effect on both the number of correct combi-\nnations of objects with their corresponding grooves and shape matching (p<0.05; see S3 Table\nfor detailed GLMM results). The factor ‘session’ did not have a significant effect on perfor-\nmance for any of the target variables in any playset (S3 Table). Posthoc tests indicate that birds\nimproved across phases with more correct combinations of objects with corresponding\ngrooves in phases 3 and 2 for playsets A and B (Wilcoxon signed Rank tests N = 7 PSA: Z =\n-2.207, p = 0.031; PSB: Z = -2.366, p = 0.016; non-sig. trend for PSC: Z = -1.913, p = 0.063;\nthere was no difference between phases 1 and 2 or 2 and 3 for any playset; see Fig 3). The num-\nber of shapes matched did not improve above trend levels across conditions (Wilcoxon signed\nrank tests N = 7 p<0.05) except for playset A, for which we similarly found a difference\nbetween phases 1 and 3 (Wilcoxon signed Rank test N = 7, Z = -2.201, p = 0.031). The corre-\nsponding posthoc tests did not reveal differences either in the number of birds’ correct object-\ngroove combinations nor shape matches between different types objects for any playset (Wil-\ncoxon signed Rank tests N = 7, p<0.05)\nKeybox\nWhen birds selected the correct object, they were nearly always able to obtain the food reward\nby inserting the ‘key’ into the ‘keyhole’ within the 5 minutes given (except for 19 trials of 936\nin keyset A and 21 trials of 1560 in keyset B).\n(a) Selection.

They also chose the cor-\nrect key above chance in the first 3 sessions of condition 1 within keyset B (one Sample\nWilcoxon Test N = 13, Z = -3.194, p<0.0001) and maintained their performance within the\nsame condition (one Sample Wilcoxon Test N = 13, Z = -3186, p<0.0001) and in condition 2\n(one Sample Wilcoxon Tests N = 13, Session 1–3 Z = -3186, p<0.0001; Session 4–6 Z = 3.241,\np<0.0001; see Figs 4 and 5).

As there were only 2 conditions per key-\nset, no posthoc tests were required. Surprisingly, the birds selected the correct key more often\nin condition 1 than in condition 2 for keyset A; the opposite was found for keyset B (Fig 1).\nWhen dividing the 6 sessions within keyset B into 2 blocks of 3 sessions for each condition,\nposthoc tests revealed a steady increase in performance across session blocks (note that, as\nmentioned early in the Results section, performance was already above chance expectation\nFig 3.

There was an above chance difference between session block 1\nand 2 in condition 1 (Wilcoxon signed rank Test N = 13, Z = -3.116, p<0.0001) between ses-\nsion block 2 in condition 1 and session block 1 in condition 2 (Wilcoxon signed rank Test\nN = 13, Z = -2.914, p = 0.002) and session block 1 and 2 in condition 2 (Wilcoxon signed rank\nTest N = 13, Z = 2.949, p<0.0001; see Fig 5).\n(b) Switch. The GLMMs on the ‘switch’ trials showed a significant effect of the factor\n‘condition’ for keyset A (F = 39.611, df1 = 1, df2 = 225, p<0.0001) and of ‘key’ for keyset B\n(F = 2.526, df1 = 4, df2 = 764, p = 0.04) but not for any of the other factors measured (See S6\nTable for detailed GLMM results). As there were only 2 ‘conditions’, posthoc tests were unnec-\nessary, they showed a subject mean of 0.27 +/-0.13SE in condition 1 and of 1.102 +/- 0.2 SE in\ncondition 2 of keyset A. For the factor ‘object’ in keyset B we only found significantly more\nswitches before subjects inserted the One-Arm than the L-Shape (Wilcoxon signed Rank Test\nN = 13, Z = -2.71, p = 0.004) or the Tripod (Wilcoxon signed Rank Test N = 13, Z = -2.98,\np = 0.001; subjects means for each shape: One-Arm 1.14+/- 0.08 SE; Two-Arm 0.89+/- 0.1 SE;\nL-Shape 0.91+/- 0.01 SE; Tripod 0.82+/- 0.09 SE; Cross 0.97+/- 0.08 SE).\nWhen looking at the percentage of switches in which the second object the birds selected\nwas the correct one, we found that the group exchanged their dropped choice for the correct\nmatch the keyhole significantly above chance expectation in keyset B (One Sample Wilcoxon\ntest N = 13, Z = 3.18, p<0.001) but not in keyset A (One Sample Wilcoxon test N = 13,\nZ = 0.94, p = 0.36). Individual data suggests that one bird switched correctly above chance for\nkeyset A and all for keyset B (Binominal Tests p<0.05; See S7 Table).\n(c) Insertion effort. The GLMM on the duration of combining the correct object with\nthe box prior to insertion (in sec) revealed a significant effect of the factor ‘key’ in both keyset\nA (F = 15.56, df1 = 4, df2 = 355, p<0.0001) and keyset B (F = 16,53, df1 = 2, df2 = 355,\np<0.0001) and an effect of an interaction of ‘group\n\u0003\nkey’ in keyset A (F = 3.24, df1 = 4,\ndf2 = 355, p<0.012) but not for other factors measured (see S8 Table for detailed GLMM\nresults). As predicted we found that the birds took longer to insert the Triangle (Wilcoxon\nFig 5. Selectio n: Percentag e of correct choices per trial over sessions .

The difference between Triangle\nand Square was not above chance (Wilcoxon signed Rank Test N = 13, Z = -1.083, p = 0.279).\nFor keyset B, we found that subjects took longer to insert the Tripod than the L-Shape and the\nOne-Arm (Wilcoxon signed Rank Test N = 13, L-shape Z = -3.181, p<0.000; One-arm Z =\n-2.41, p = 0.01) and longer for the Cross than any other object (Wilcoxon signed Rank Test\nN = 13, L-shape Z = -3.041, p = 0.001; One-Arm Z = -2.55, p = 0.008; Tripod Z = -2.411,\np = 0.013, Two-Arm Z = -2.341, p = 0.01; see Fig 6). We did not find a significant effect of ‘key’\non the duration of combination (Mann-Whitney U tests all p<0.025; n.s. after Bonferroni\nHolms correction).\nThe GLMM on the number of times the birds combined the correct key with the keyhole\nbefore insertion (frequency) similarly indicates a significant effect of key-type for both keyset\nA (F = 13.071, df1 = 2, df2 = 331, p<0.0001) and keyset B (F = 7.113, df1 = 4, df2 = 335,\np<0.0001) but not for any other factor measured (see S8 Table for detailed GLMM results).\nAgain, we found that the animals combined the Triangle (Wilcoxon signed Rank Test\nN = 13, Z = -3.06, p<0.0001) and the Square (Wilcoxon signed Rank Test N = 13, Z = -3.018,\np<0.0001) more often than the Circle with the corresponding keyhole before succeeding to\ninsert it, but the difference between Triangle and Square was not above chance (Wilcoxon\nsigned Rank Test N = 13, Z = -3.14, p = 0.787; see Fig 6 for more detail). Within keyset B they\nneeded more combinations for the Cross than for the L-shape (Wilcoxon signed Rank Test\nN = 13, Z = -2.904, p = 0.001) and the Two-Arm (Z = -2.8314, p = 0.002).

For the Tripod, subjects also required\nsignificantly more combinations than the L-shape (Wilcoxon signed Rank Test N = 13, Z =\n-3.042, p = 0.00; see Fig 6). Fig 6 indicates that the birds rarely needed more than two insertion\nattempts for all shapes except the Cross. Also, they rarely needed more than a single attempt to\ninsert the Circle and interestingly the non-symmetric L-shaped key.\nImportantly, subjects seemed to use shape-matching to solve keyset A (due to the keys’ geo-\nmetrical properties, it was impossible to insert them any other way) but not Keyset B. Qualita-\ntively, the birds initially seemed to attempt to align the axes of the object of keyset B but soon\ndiscovered alternative solutions to each different task which were then used uniformly to insert\nthe correct key into its corresponding keyhole: the One-Arm key was held in a way that the\nprotrusion either faced backwards or forwards while being inserted, the two protrusions corre-\nspondingly faced backwards and forwards in the Two-Arm condition; in the L-Shape condi-\ntion subjects held the tool at one of the protrusions, inserted the other one into the box and\ntilted the object upwards through the hole; the Tripod was held at one end of its long axis and\nthus only the protrusion at its short axis was fitted through the one of the three remaining\ngrooves; in the Cross condition, they proceeded similarly but aligned two opposite protrusions\nto their grooves (For more information, watch S1 and S2 Videos).\nDiscussion\nUnrewarded shape matching\nIn the first part of our study, when birds were offered a selection of objects alongside various\nsubstrate cutouts in an unrewarded context, they combined objects with their corresponding\ncutouts at chance levels during the initial phase. Bringing a shape into contact with its corre-\nsponding frame thus seems to occur accidentally while trying to insert different objects into\ndifferent substrates. The behaviour seems to be driven by these cockatoos’ playful propensity\nto combine two objects or objects with substrates in different ways. Previous studies indicate\nthat such combinatory object play occurs at similar levels in this species as in habitually tool\nusing birds such as New Caledonian crows and black Palm cockatoos [14,30]. Nevertheless,\nexperience in unstacking objects and, even more, human demonstrations strongly increased\nthe number of correct object-substrate combinations as well as successful shape-frame\nmatches. This indicates that both experiencing the manipulative effect of unstacking an object\nfrom a pole/indention as well as the social enhancement involved in a human demonstration\nstrongly increases the birds’ motivation to interact with the object on the corresponding pole/\nsubstrate. Thereby, the birds seem to attempt to playfully repeat the experienced/obser ved\naction despite the lack of a reward. In particular, the strong effect of demonstrations is surpris-\ning as a previous study showed little impact of stimulus enhancement by a conspecific on the\nchoice of a non-food object for rostral manipulation in this species [31]. A human may be\nassociated with food from previous experiments and thus enhance exploration. Alternatively,\nan object-substrate interaction may constitute a more interesting demonstration than a simple\nrostral manipulation. Incidentally, the birds have been shown to learn socially in a tool using\ncontext [29].\nKeybox\nAs soon as shape-frame matching became part of the solution to a tool using task in the\nkeybox experiment, subjects became proficient at fitting the appropriate object into a corre-\nsponding opening, regardless of its shape.\nShape match ing in Goffin’s cockatoos\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.01868 59 November 8, 2017 12 / 19\nKeybox: Tool selection. Our evaluation on tool selection signifies that subjects picked the\ncorrect key above chance expectation immediately, within the first session block, for both key-\nsets. Nevertheless, they kept perfecting their performance throughout sessions in keyset B.\nThis is fairly surprising as the same subjects kept failing a basic matching to sample (MTS)\ntask on the touchscreen for hundreds of trials in the previous year [20]. As they could solve dif-\nferent problems on the touchscreen it is unlikely that they had problems with vision or motiva-\ntion [32]. Nevertheless, it is possible that the virtual environment of the touchscreen setup\nappeared too abstract to allow for fast MTS conceptualisation. As mentioned before, direct\ncomparisons between touch screen tasks versus using solid objects indicate a similar trend in\nsome birds and humans [21–23]. It is likely that having a haptic in addition to a visual experi-\nence and solid 3D versus 2D objects may increase the number of stimuli that can be used for\ndiscrimination [33, 34]. An even more practical explanation is that matching a tool into a cor-\nresponding substrate frame may provide a more purposeful context than merely learning to\nmatch same to same.\nInterestingly, subjects performed better in condition 1 than condition 2 of keyset A. Here it\nis important to note that in condition 2, the remaining objects were not removed after a key\nwas selected, allowing the birds to correct a wrong choice. The costs imposed by an incorrect\nselection in condition 2 were therefore much smaller than in condition 1. Furthermore, the\nparrots tend to lose interest after extensive exposure to the same experimental setups and start\nexploring the affordances of the apparatus instead of solving the problem in the habitual way,\ne.g. [30, 35, 36].\nWhile making a selection, the animals often picked up one object, but discarded it in favour\nfor another prior to insertion (note that we only removed the other objects in condition 1 after\nthey had made contact with the apparatus). At least for keyset B, the second key the birds\nchose was usually the correct one. This makes it likely that the animals use a combination of\nhaptic information from holding the key against their beak tip organ [37] as well as visual\ninformation from the keyhole in order to exclude specific objects for the task at hand: our sub-\njects have previously shown to be able to use inference by exclusion in a more abstract setup\n[32]. Moreover, in a tool making study [17] they were observed to immediately discard mate-\nrial pieces that they had previously manufactured but that were of insufficient length to poke\nat an out-off-reach food after checking up on the distance of the goal item. The One-Arm key-\nhole produced particularly many of such object ‘switches’. One possible explanation for these\nresults could be the lack of features provided by the One-Arm keyhole as opposed to the other\nkeyholes featuring at least two grooves and therefore also more information about the correct\nkey. In the case of the One-Arm keyhole, inference by exclusion might therefore have been a\nfeasible strategy to find the correct key. Notably, in Demery’s study [26], asymmetrical shapes\nwere explored more than symmetrical ones, suggesting that the asymmetrical One-Arm key-\nhole triggered more extensive exploration before insertion.\nKeybox: Insertion effort. Evidently, frequency and duration are not independent (the\nmore placement attempts a bird makes, the longer it takes to successfully insert the key).\nTherefore, finding trends in the same direction is not unexpected.\nData on frequency in keyset A suggests that subjects constantly inserted the circular object\non the first placement attempt and that they needed only around 2 placement attempts for\nboth the Square and the Triangle. This is in contrast to previous findings in primates, which\nneeded around 4–5 placements on average when inserting a stick into a circular hole or a stick\ninto a groove of the same length (the capuchins needed 9 placements for the latter) [7]. How-\never, our results parallel findings in human infants, who were more successful in inserting\nobjects with a lower level of symmetry [1].\nShape match ing in Goffin’s cockatoos\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.01868 59 November 8, 2017 13 / 19\nNevertheless, data on frequency and duration in keyset A parallels primate results and,\nunsurprisingly, confirms our predictions that lower levels of symmetry seem to increase the\nanimals’ insertion effort.\nAs to the question whether some keys might have been easier to grasp than others due to\ntheir shape (keys with more edges might be easier to hold, e.g. the Square easier than Triangle),\nfrequency and duration do not show a significant difference. Due to the highly coordinated\nbeak-tongue movements parrots are capable of, the key shape is rather unlikely to have an\ninfluence on the birds’ grasp.\nFindings on keyset B, however, contradict predictions that would be made according to the\ndifferent degrees of symmetry and number of axis on the objects: If the objects had been fully\naligned as in keyset A in order to achieve insertion we would have expected the birds’ insertion\neffort to behave as follows: L-Shape>Tripod>One- Arm>Two-Arm> Cross. Instead, what we\nfound was this trend: Cross>Tripod>Two Arm>L-shape & One Arm. These patterns can be\nexplained by the animals’ object-specific insertion techniques to circumvent alignment of per-\nforating object features with the keyhole. This was possible as we decided not to use objects\nthat had elongated depth (as the upper mandible is bigger and curved, we were not sure\nwhether the birds would still be able to have full sight of the keyhole during insertion with the\ntool pointing down their beak). Furthermore, if the surface of the depth became larger than\nthe surface of the front subjects might pay less attention to the shape of the front. The parrots\nturned each object in a specific manner, consequently avoiding the alignment of some of the\nfeatures by holding at least one protrusion and, if possible, two, facing forwards and backwards\nduring insertion (see S2 Fig, S1 and S2 Videos). Hence, they only needed to align one remain-\ning protrusion when the Tripod was the key and two remaining protrusions when the Cross\nwas the key, explaining their above performance.\nAdditionally, subjects behaved flexibly, using a completely different motor routine for\ninserting the L-shape, inserting first one of the two protrusions into the big part of the opening\nand thereafter tossing the rest of the object through the keyhole with an upward movement of\nthe beak. This made the insertion of the L-shape key as successful as the insertion of the One-\nArm. As mentioned previously, human infants facing a posting task featuring a disc and a lin-\near slot for insertion (as inserting a coin into a cash machine), did not turn the disc to facilitate\ninsertion before 24 months of age [2]. This finding is partly linked to the poor development of\nan allocentric frame of reference in younger infants. The birds, in contrast, seem to quickly\nlearn to pay attention to the major axes of the objects as well as the insertion groove. Also, the\nparrots turning the objects to avoid insertion effort suggests that they do seem to use an allo-\ncentric frame of reference when handling these tools.\nWe finally looked at a possible effect of playful experience with unrewarded inserting and\nstacking/unstacking of similar object shapes on performance in both tool selection as well\nas insertion effort. Although all birds in the test group had successfully inserted/stacked/\nunstacked each shape several times before testing started, we failed to find any effect of unre-\nwarded shape matching experience on birds’ performance in the keybox task. Thus, the intense\nand intrinsically structured combinatorial object play in this species may not have a direct ben-\nefit, like gaining experience for future problem-solving tasks, but could simply be a side effect\nof their explorative foraging technique.\nOtherwise, the objects used in the play experience may not have been sufficiently analo-\ngous in size and weight to the objects used in the test or that the experience was not intense\nenough to create an observable effect. Furthermore, the sequence of the tasks as well as the\ntime passed between play experience and tool use task could have influenced the effect of\nplay on the keybox task.\nShape match ing in Goffin’s cockatoos\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.01868 59 November 8, 2017 14 / 19\nConclusion\nOur results suggest that the ability to align objects to a corresponding substrate groove is nei-\nther limited to primates nor to habitually tool using species nor to animals with hand-like\nappendices. While our animals seem to use an allocentric frame of reference to achieve object\ninsertions it is not yet possible to determine whether they construct the alignments in 3 dimen-\nsions as we were unable to observe small details of the adjustment of the object on the substrate\nwith the birds blocking the view too often to obtain reliable data.\nShape-frame matching abilities for capuchins and chimpanzees are likely to facilitate tool\nuse. For example, in both species various populations have been observed to use sticks to\nprobe for food in different holes and crevices, and to crack nuts by placing the nut on an anvil\nand then striking the nut with a hammer stone, e.g. [38–40]. The Goffin’s cockatoo cannot be\nconsidered a habitual tool user, at least not on a population-wide level as suggested by unpub-\nlished data from Osuna-Mascaro & Auersperg. Nevertheless, they are highly opportunistic\nforagers using different feeding techniques that include extractive foraging according to\nunpublished data from O’Hara & Mioduszewska. While lacking primate hands, their beak is\nhighly dexterous, with a flexible upper mandible and a tongue that can be moved in an almost\nthumb-like manner [30]. Additionally, Auersperg et al. [13] and unpublished data from\nOsuna-Mascaro & Auersperg suggest that they have a strong predisposition to combine objects\nduring play and occasionally also during foraging. From present knowledge, we can assume\nthat their ability to align objects seems to derive from domain general flexibility rather than a\nspecific specialisation.\nFuture comparative research on the basics of object alignment should incorporate more\navian species; particularly habitual and non-habitual tool using birds and nest building parrots\nwould be of great interest. Follow up research on the Goffin’s cockatoo will focus on fine\ndetails of object alignment and beak-tongue actions on the object before and during insertion\nwhich we hope to achieve by filming from the inside of a Perspex box. This will help us deter-\nmine a better general overview of their fitting techniques and to evaluate the role of visual\nadjustment in these techniques [e.g. 9].\nSupporting information\nS1 Video.
