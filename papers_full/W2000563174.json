Although a \ntransformer may continue in normal operation with minor \nwinding deformation , its capability to withstand further \nmechanical and electrical stresses  substantially decreases \nwhich may lead to a sudden catastrophic failure. Therefore, it \nis essential to detect minor winding deformation as soon as \npossible and take a proper remedial action [2, 3]. Frequency \nresponse analysis (FRA) is a powerful diagnostic technique \ncurrently used to identify winding deformation within power \ntransformers [2, 4-7]. FRA technique  is based on the fact \nthat transformer winding deformation and displacement \nchange its impedances and consequently altering its \nfrequency response. The change in transformer FRA \nsignature is used for fault identification and quantification.  \nThe main drawback of FRA technique is its relines on \ngraphical analysis that requires expert personnel to conduct \nthe test and to analyse its results as so far, there is no general \nguideline for interpreting FRA signatures. There have been \nmany attempts in the literature to understand the impact of \nvarious mechanical faults on the transformer FRA signature.  \nAs practical fault implementation on real transformer is very \ndifficult to perform without harming the transformer, most  of \nthese studies have been performed on a high frequency \ntransformer equivalent circuit model by randomly changing \nthe value of particular electrical parameters to simulate \nvarious mechanical faults  [8, 9]. None of these studies  really \ninvestigated the correlation between the fault level and the \npercentage change in the relevant electrical parameters  for \nprecise fault simulation. This paper presents a comprehensive \nanalysis of the transformer winding radial (buckling) \ndeformation. To emulate real transformer operation, 3D finite \nelement software is used to simulate the physical geometry of \na single-phase transformer. Various radial deformation levels \nare implemented in both high voltage (HV) and low voltage \n(LV) windings and its impact on the change of the equivalent \nelectrical parameters is investigated. Impact of fault location \nas well as transformer size is also investigated as will be \ndetailed in the sections below.  \n \n2 FINIT ELEMENT ANALYSIS \n   Maxwell software is used to simulate the transformer model \ngeometry shown in Fig ure 1a. As shown in the figure, the \ntransformer is single phase of shell-type. The model consists \nof metal shield core and pressboard spacers between LV and \nHV windings. In order to maintain the exact position of the \nlow voltage winding, pressboard spacers ar e placed on core \ninsulation. The HV winding consists of 5  disks, 820 turns and \nthe LV winding consists of 4 disks, 130 turns. \n \n                                                (a) \n \nCsh-HGsh-H\nRs \nLs\nCHL\nCHL\nG GHL\nGsh-L\nG\nRs \nG G\nLs Cg-L\nCg-L/2\nRo\nVin\nLV Winding HV Winding \nVO\nCg-H/2\nCsh-L\nCg-H\nGHL\nRi\nMij Mi’j’\nMij’\n \n                                                (b) \nFigure 1. (a) Power Transformer 3D model, (b)  Transformer distributed \nparameters model.  \n   The 3D transformer model is solved in magneto static and \nelectrostatic solvers using Maxwell equations to extract the \ninductance, capacitance matrices while eddy current is used to \ncalculate w inding resistance. The high frequency equivalent \nelectrical circuit of the transformer is shown in Figure 1b. In \nthe model, HV and LV windings are represented by series \nresistance (Rs) and inductance (L s) shunted by capacitor (C s) \nand conductance (G s). The capacitance between HV winding \nand LV winding (CHL) shunted by dielectric conductance (GHL) \nsimulates the insulations between the two windings. Also, the \nmutual inductances (M) between relevant coils are represented. \nThe dielectric insulation between the LV winding and the \nearthed core and that is between the HV winding and the \nearthed tank are simulated by a capacitance (C\ng) and dielectric \nconductance (G). When short-circuit faults result in winding  \ndeformation in a transformer, a change in the parameters of \nthe winding model will take place . To calculate the \ncapacitance matrix of the transformer model , Maxwell 3D \nperforms a sequence of electro static field simulations. In each \nfield simulation , for an n-conductor system, n field \nsimulations are automatically performed. The energy stored in \nthe electric field associated with the capacitance between two \nconductors is given by[10]: \nΩ×= ∫Ω\ndEDW jiij .2\n1                                                 (1) \nwhere, Wij is the energy in the electric field associated with \nflux lines that connect charges on conduc tor i to those on \nconductor j, Di is the electric flux density associated with \nconductor i  and Ej is the electric field associated with \nconductor j.   \nThe capacitance between conductors i and j is therefore: \nΩ×== ∫Ω\ndEDV\nWC ji\nij\n.2\n12\n2\n                                               (2) \nTo calculate the inductance, the average magnetic energy WAV \nis calculated first as: \n                                                  (3) \nwhere B is the magnetic field density and V is the volume of \nthe conductor. Then inductance can be calculated from the \naverage magnetic energy and peak winding current IPeak as \nbelow[10]. \n                                                                            (4) \n3  RADIAL FORCE FAILURE MODE  \nDuring short circuit fault, the electromagnetic forces acting on \nthe coils may suddenly rise from a few pounds to tons. These \nforces oscillate at double of the circuit frequency [11].  The \nradial component s of the electromagnetic forces in a \ntransformer with concentric disk windings have never been \nconsidered significant due to the fact that radial strength of the \nwinding is high enough to cope with these forces [4]. Winding \nradial buckling can be av oided by a perfect ly round winding \ncross-section and by placing adequate radial spacer supports \nas shown in Figure 1a [12-14]. On t he other hand  spacer \nsuppo rts influence the buckling strength of windings which \nare subjected to radial electromagnetic forces  [15]. Radial \nforces in disk windings of a two -winding transformer produce \na hoop stress that tends to extend the radius of the outer \nwinding and at the same time the y produce a compressive \nstress in the inner winding producing buckling as shown in \nFigure 2. The mean hoop stress (σ\nmean) in the conductor of the \nouter winding at the peak of the first half cycle of short-circuit \ncurrent, assuming an asymmetry factor of 1.8 is [16, 17]. \nHdVBW\nV\nAV ×= ∫4\n1\n2\n4\nPeak\nAV\nI\nWL =\n \n(peak)kN/mm030 2\n2\nz\ncu\nmean\nhe\nW.σ =                                        (6) \n where Wcu is I2Rdc losses in the winding in kW , h is axial \nheight of the winding in mm and ez is per unit applied voltage. \n \nFigure 2. (a) Forced buckling (LV), (b) Free buckling (HV)  \n   The inner winding is subjected to radial forces acting \ninwards (forced buckling) while it acts outward on the outer \nwinding (free buckling) as shown in Figure 2 . The failure \nmodes include winding collapse or bending between supports. \nIf the winding is of disk type, each disk is subjected to a radial \nforce that can be calculated as [18, 19] \nw\nccmean\nr\nD\nAnP σπ2=                                                          (7) \nwhere, meanσ is mean stress calculated in (6), Pr is the radial \nforce in kN per mm of length, Ac is cross sectional area of the \ndisk in mm2 , nc is number of conductors in each disk and Dw \nis the mean diameter of the winding in mm.  \n \n4 IMPACT OF BUCKLING DEFORMATION \nON EQUIVALENT ELECTRIC CIRCUIT \nPARAMETERS \nIn order to exactly simulate radial deformation using \ntransformer equivalent electrical circuit model, it is essential to \ndetect the percentage change in the electrical circuit parameters \nthat is corresponding to a particular fault level. According to  \n[20-22], radial deformation is simulated by randomly changing \nthe value of the capacitance HV and of LV windings while the \nchange in inductance is neglected. The study did not emphasize \nthe amount of c hange in the capacitance that is corresponding \nto the studied fault levels. The main contribution of this paper \nis that it investigates the correlation between various radial \nfault levels and the corresponding percentage change in \nelectrical circuit parameters to facilitate accurate simulation of \nradial fault using transformer high frequency electrical \nequivalent circuit and to ease the quantification analysis of \nFRA signatures .  In this regard,  the physical geometrical \ndimensions of a single-phase transformer is simulated using 3D \nfinite element and by means of coupling ANSYS magnetic part \nwith ANSYS static structural mechanical part,  various radial \ndeformation levels which is calculated as the percentage ratio \nof the change in perimeter of the faulty disk with respect to the \ndisk perimeter prior to deformation  are implemented by \ncontrolling the level of the short circuit current through the \nwindings. In case of a single phase transformer, current during \ntransient condition can be approximately expressed as [4, 23\n]: \n \nwhere ;  and   \nwhere  is the voltage angle when fault is occurred, ISC is the \nsteady state value of short circuit current, I 0 is the initial \ncurrent at fault application, R eq and Leq represent the total \nseries impedance of the  winding, V  is the supply effective \nvoltage. \nThe c alculated electromagnetic forces are used as input \nsource of sequential FEM to predict the resultant mechanical \nforces considering the structural characteristics such as stress \ndistribution and winding deformation. Radial force due to \nshort circuit current  and axial leakage flux within the gap \nbetween the HV and LV  windings is calculated in finite \nelement analysis as [4]: \n( )NIH\nNIDF\nw\naveradial 22\n2 0\n\n\n\n\n\n= µπ                                       (9) \nwhere Hw, Dave, N, I and µ0 are respectively, winding height, \naverage winding diameter, number of turns, RMS winding \ncurrent and permeability of air.  \nTo investigate the impact of fault location on the percentage \nchange in various electrical parameters of the transformer \nequivalent circuit, radial deformation has be en simulated in \nthree different locations of the HV and LV windings as shown \nin Figure 3. Impact of transformer sizing is also investigated as \nwill be elaborated in the following sections.  \nA. Case study 1: 1MVA single-phase Transformer \n   Figure 4 shows the variation of the magnetic energy after \ndeformation on the top disk of HV winding due to short circuit \ncurrent. Inductances associated with the deformed disks are \ncalculated using Maxwell’s equations.  To calculate the \ncapacitance matrix for the deformed winding a sequence of \nelectrostatic field simulations is performed to measure the \nenergy stored in the e lectric field associated with the \ncapacitance between the HV and LV windings, HV winding \nand the core and the LV winding and tank. The electrical \nparameters matrices are extracted for normal and faulty \nconditions and the percentage change in each parameter due to \nbuckling deformation is calculated as:  \nPercentage change in parameter x =         (10) \nwhere xn and xf are respectively the parameter (inductance or \ncapacitance) values during normal and faulty conditions.  \nThis procedure is performed for three different fault locations; \ntop, middle and bottom of both HV and LV windings . The \npercentage changes in inductive and capacitive elements as a \nfunction of various fault levels are shown in Figures 5 and 6. \nFigure 5 reveals that the p ercentage change in the self - \ninductance of the deformed disk winding decreases after force \nbuckling on LV winding with the increase in fault level. The \n\n \npercentage change in the capacitance between LV and HV \nwindings at the fault location decreases with th e increase of \nfault level, whereas  the percentage change in the c apacitance \nbetween the LV winding and the core  increases since the \ndistance between the deformed disk and core decreases. Figure \n6 shows that, due to the f ree buckling that the HV winding \nexhibits, the percentage change in capacitance between H V \nwinding and tank and the percentage change in the self -\ninductance of HV winding increase  with the increase in fault \nlevel. The percentage change in the capacitance between HV \nand LV winding shown in Figure 6c has the same trend as the \none shown in Figure 5c.    \n \nFigure 3. (a) Free buckling HV winding (Top, Middle and Bottom). (b) Force buckling LV winding (Top, Middle and Bottom) \n \n \nFigure 4. Variation of magnetic energy after deformation on top disk of HV. \n    Simulation results show  that deformation location has a \nslight impact on the electrostatic and magnetoestatic fields. As \na result the percentage change in the electrical circuit \nparameters is not significantly impacted by the  fault location \nas shown in Figures 5 and 6.    \nB. Case study 2: 5MVA single-phase Transformer   \nTo investigate  the impact of transformer sizing on the \nelectrical parameters variation due to radial deformation, the \ngeometry of 5 MVA transformer is simulated and the same \napproach explained above is used to calculate the percentage \nchange in the equivalent electrical  parameters corresponding \nto various fault levels of free buckling deformation on the HV \nwinding in three different locations as shown in Figure 7 and \nthe change of electrical parameters is shown in Figure 8.  \n \n \n \nFigure 5.

However parameters \nvariation in the high rating transformer is slightly higher. \n \n \nFigure 8.Variation of Inductance and Capacitance Matrices (free buckling on  \nHV winding) - 5 MVA transformer \n   \n5 IMPACT OF PROPOSED PARAMETERS \nCHANGE ON FRA SIGNATURE \n  To investigate the effect of the parameters change proposed \nin the previous section on the transformer FRA signature, the \ntransformer model (1MVA) shown in Figure 1b is energized \nby a sweep frequency AC source  (Vin) of 10 volt and \nvariable frequency (up to 1 MHz) and the  FRA signature \n(Transfer function; TF = 20 log10(Vo/Vi)) is plotted  against \nfrequency for healthy and faulty conditions. The value of the \nelectrical parameters corresponding to each fault level is \ncalculated based on Figures 5 and 6. Figure 9 shows the \ninfluence of two fault levels of HV and LV winding buckling \ndeformation (1% and 5%) that is simulated by only changing \nthe capacitance matrix as proposed in the literature [ 20, 21] \non the FRA signature. As shown in Figure 9, the fault impact \non the FRA signature is hardly observable in the frequency \nrange less than 500 kHz, while the resonance frequencies \nand magnitude are slightly changed and hardly observed at \nhigh frequency range. Figure 10 shows the effect of 1% and \n5% buckling deformation on the FRA signature of the HV \nand LV windings by considering both capacitance and \n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 100\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6Self- Inductance (%)\n \n \nTop Middle Bottom\n(a)\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 100\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12C HV-Tank (%)\n \n \nTop Middle Bottom\n(b)\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10-12\n-10\n-8\n-6\n-4\n-2\n0\nFault (%)\nC HV-LV (%)\n \n \nTop Middle Bottom\n(c)\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 100\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10Self-Inductance (%)\n \n \nTop Middle Bottom\n(a)\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 100\n4\n8\n12\n16C HV-Tank (%)\n \n \nTop Middle Bottom\n(b)\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10-13\n-11\n-9\n-7\n-5\n-3\n-1\n0\nFault (%)\nC HV-LV (%)\n \n \nTop Middle Bottom\n(c)\n\n \ninductance variation to simulate the buckling deformation as \nproposed in this paper.  \n \n \nFigure 9.

Effect of buckling deformation on FRA signature (simulated by \nchanging capacitance and inductance matrices) (a) Free buckling on HV \nwinding (b) Force buckling on LV winding.  \n   In contrary with the FRA signatures shown in Figure 9, by \nconsidering both capacitance and inductance variation in \nsimulating buckling deformation, the influence of the fault \non the FRA signature is observable even for 1% fault level \non the entire frequency rang. This aligns well with the \npractical results presented in [1 , 9, 24, 25] that reveal \nbuckling deformation influences the whole frequency range \nof the FRA signature. The change in the FRA signature in \ncase of HV buckling fau lt in the low frequency range is \nattributed to the change in the magnetic flux distribution due \nto the fault as clearly shown in Figure 7. \n   Table 1 and 2  summarize the variation of the resonance \nfrequencies Δf due to 5% radial deformation with respect to the \nhealthy FRA signature for both HV and LV windings of a two \nsingle phase transformers of different rating; 1MVA and 5 \nMVA investigated in the paper. Five resonance peaks in four \nfrequency ranges (10- 100 kHz, 100-400 kHz, 400- 600 kHz \nand 600-1MHz) are tabulated to quantify the change in peak \nresonances without and with considering inductance matrix  \nvariation as proposed in this paper. It is noted that variation in \nthe FRA signature due to buckling fault starts in the frequency \nrange above 400 kHz if only capacitance elements variation is \nconsidered. While variation in the FRA signature starts from \nthe low frequency range when inductive elements are \nconsidered too which agrees with the practical measurements \npresented in [1, 9, 26] . Tables 1 and 2 show tha t with the \nincrease in transformer rating, the shift in resonance \nfrequencies will increase for the same fault level.  \nTable 1.

Based on simulation results  \npresented in the paper, the following conclusions can be drawn: \n• In contrary with other previous studies that neglected the \nvariation of inductance elements in simulating transformer \nwinding radial deformation, results of finite element analysis \nshow that by considering capacitance and inductance elements \nvariation, accurate buckling deformation  can be emulated \nusing the transformer equivalent circuit model. \n• By considering the change in inductance and capacitance \nelements, a slight radial deformation could be detected through \ntransformer FRA signature. \n0 1 10 100 1000\nFrequency (kHz)\n-140\n-130\n-120\n-110\n-100\n-90\n-80\n-70\n-60\n-50TF(dB)\nCurve Info\nHealthy\n1%\n5%\n0 1 10 100 1000\nFrequency (kHz)\n-130\n-120\n-110\n-100\n-90\n-80\n-70\n-60\n-50TF(dB)\nCurve Info\nHealthy\n1%\n5%\n0 1 10 100 1000\nFrequency (kHz)\n-140\n-130\n-120\n-110\n-100\n-90\n-80\n-70\n-60\n-50TF (dB)\nCurve Info\nHealthy\n1%\n5%\n0 1 10 100 1000\nFrequency (kHz)\n-130\n-120\n-110\n-100\n-90\n-80\n-70\n-60\n-50TF(dB)\nCurve Info\nHealthy\n1%\n5%\n(a) \n(b) \n(b) \n(a) \n \n• The paper introduces effective charts that correlate the \npercentage change in each electrical parameter with various \nradial deformation fault levels . This facilitates precise \nsimulation of radial deformation using transformer equival ent \ncircuit and eases the quantification analysis of FRA signature. \n• The percentage change of the electrical parameters due to \nradial deformation is almost independent on the fault location.  \n• The shift in the entire frequency range of the FRA signature \ncan be used as an index for the detection of the radial \ndeformation and the  amount of change is correlated to the \nseverity of fault level. \nAPPENDIX \nTable 3 Transformer design data  \nTransformer Power 1MVA 5MVA \nTransformer ratio 22.9kV/3.3kV 66kV/11kV \nOuter radius HV 560mm 826mm \nOuter radius LV 480mm 625mm \nHV winding  height 670mm 1576mm \nLV winding  height 670mm 1425mm \nREFRENCES \n[1] \"IEEE Guide for the Application and Interpretation of Frequency \nResponse Analysis for Oil -Immersed Transformers,\" IEEE Std C57.149 -\n2012, pp. 1-72, 2013. \n[2] P.
