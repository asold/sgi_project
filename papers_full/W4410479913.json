Introduction \nThe field of artificial intelligence is undergoing rapid transformation, with two particularly significant developments captu ring \nresearchers’ attention: the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and the emergence of Agentic AI systems [1, 2]. While \nAGI represents the long -standing goal of creating machines with human -level general intelligence [3], Agentic AI focuses on \ndeveloping autonomous systems capable of complex decision -making within specific domains [4]. Recent advancemen ts have \nreignited debates about the feasibility and timeline for achieving AGI. Some experts predict AGI could emerge as early as 2025 \n[5, 6], while others remain skeptical, arguing that fundamental challenges remain unresolved [7, 8]. Meanwhile, Agentic A I has \ngained traction as a practical approach to creating more autonomous and capable AI systems [9, 10]. This paper examines the \ncurrent state of both AGI and Agentic AI, their relationship, and their potential impacts on industry and society. Section II  \nexplores definitions and key concepts. Section III analyzes recent technological developments. Section IV discusses challenge s \nand limitations.

Challenges and Limitations \nA) Technical Challenges \nThe path to AGI faces several significant technical \nhurdles: \n Developing systems with true understanding and \nreasoning capabilities [53] \n Creating AI that can generalize across diverse domains \n[49] \n Implementing robust memory and learning \nmechanisms [47] \n Achieving human-level adaptability and creativity [48] \n \nB) Agentic AI systems face their own set of challenges \n Ensuring reliable autonomous operation [19] \n Maintaining appropriate human oversight [50] \n Managing complex multi-agent interactions [54] \n Balancing autonomy with safety constraints [38] \n \n \nInternational Journal of Multidisciplinary Research and Growth Evaluation www.allmultidisciplinaryjournal.com  \n \n    686 | P a g e  \n \nC) Safety and Ethical Considerations \nBoth AGI and advanced Agentic AI systems raise \nimportant safety concerns \n Potential for misuse or unintended consequences [36] \n Alignment with human values and intentions [40] \n Governance and control mechanisms [39] \n Long-term societal impacts [42] \n \nRecent proposals emphasize the need for urgent safety \nmeasures as these technologies advance [38, 55]. \n \n8. Conclusion \nWhile AGI remains an ambitious and potentially distant goal \n[7], Agentic  AI represents a practical stepping stone that is \nalready delivering value across industries [9, 56]. The coming \nyears will likely see continued progress in both areas, with \nseveral key developments on the horizon: \n Refinement of AGI benchmarks and measurement \nframeworks [57] \n Expansion of Agentic AI applications across sectors [18] \n Increased focus on safety and governance mechanisms \n[38] \n Development of hybrid systems combining generative \nand agentic capabilities [46] \n \nAs these technologies evolve, it will be crucial to maintain \nbalanced perspectives that acknowledge both their potential \nand limitations. Future research should focus on developing \nrobust evaluation methodologies, safety protocols, and \npractical implement ation frameworks to ensure these \npowerful technologies deliver maximum benefit while \nminimizing risks. \nThis comprehensive review has examined the current state of \nArtificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Agentic AI, \nanalyzing their technical foundations, capabilities, and \ntrajectories. Our investigation reveals several key insights \nabout the evolving AI landscape: \nFirst, while AGI remains an aspirational goal with significant \ntechnical hurdles [7, 8], Agentic AI has emerged as a practical \nintermediate step  that is already demonstrating real -world \nvalue [9, 10]. The development of frameworks like OpenAI’s \n5-level AGI classification system [23] and specialized Agentic \nAI platforms [24] indicates growing sophistication in both \ndomains. \nSecond, the comparative analysis highlights fundamental \ndifferences between AI paradigms. Where traditional narrow \nAI excels at specific tasks and generative AI at content \ncreation, Agentic AI introduces autonomous decision -\nmaking capabilities [2], while AGI promises (but has not  yet \nachieved) human -level generalization [3]. This spectrum of \ncapabilities suggests a maturation path for AI systems, with \nAgentic AI serving as a crucial bridge between current \ntechnologies and future AGI aspirations [51]. \nThird, the technical requireme nts for these advanced AI \nsystems are becoming increasingly demanding, from \nspecialized hardware architectures [39] to novel cloud services \nsupporting autonomous agent deployment [18]. These \ninfrastructure developments both enable and constrain \nprogress in the field. \nLooking ahead, three critical priorities emerge for researchers \nand practitioners: Development of Robust Evaluation \nFrameworks: As Agentic  AI systems become more \nautonomous and AGI research advances, standardized \nmetrics and testing environments [25] will be essential for \nmeasuring progress and ensuring reliability. Safety and \nGovernance Mechanisms: The unique risks posed by \nautonomous syste ms [50] and potential AGI [38] demand \ncontinued investment in alignment research and ethical \nframeworks. \nPractical Implementation Strategies: Organizations should \nfocus on incremental adoption of Agentic AI solutions [34] \nwhile maintaining realistic expectations about AGI timelines. \nThe rapid evolution of these technologies suggests that while \nAGI may remain years or decades away, Agentic AI is poised \nfor near -term expansion across industries [20, 29] . By \nmaintaining balanced perspectives that acknowledge both the \npotential and limitations of these paradigms, the AI \ncommunity can steer development toward beneficial \noutcomes while mitigating risks. \nFuture research should particularly focus on hybrid \narchitectures that combine the strengths of different \napproaches [21], as well as interdisciplinary efforts to address \nthe societal implications of increasingly autonomous AI \nsystems [28, 43] \n \n9.
