INTRODUCTION\nOWER electronic transformer (PET) is a new type of \nelectrical equipment that can realize harmonic elimination, \nvoltage compensation, device self-protection, and power \nconversion between different AC and DC voltage levels [1]-[4]. \nThe cascaded H-bridge (CHB) converter has the characteristics \nof high modularity, scalability and easy redundancy design [1], \nwhich makes it become a popular circuit topology in PET \nsystem. \nFor PET, a centralized or distributed control system can be \nadopted to achieve the control goal [5], [6].

However, the centralized \ncontrol requires each cascaded power module to communicate \nwith the central controller through a high-speed communication \nlink, which increases the computational and communication \nburden of the central controller, reduces the modularity and \nscalability of a PET system [9]. Therefore, the distributed \ncontrol is more suitable for the PET system with a large number \nof cascaded power modules. \nThe distributed control can be realized as central-local \ndistributed architecture [6] or master-slave distributed \narchitecture [10]. For the central-local distributed architecture, \na central controller and many local controllers are employed, \nthe system-level control and internal dynamics control tasks are \nassigned to either the central controller or the local controller. \nIn [6], a central controller is employed only to realize the \nsystem-level output power control and protection for a modular \nmultilevel converter (MMC), the local controllers process the \ntasks such as submodule capacitor voltage balance, differential \ncurrent regulation, PWM generation and local protection. \nTherefore, the communication burden of the communication \nnetwork is significantly reduced because the data interaction \namong the central controller and the local controllers is greatly \nreduced. For the cascaded STACOM, the central controller can \neven be eliminated, and the individual local controller makes \nthe decisions to control each cascaded power module [11]. The \nreactive power sharing, DC-link voltage balancing and \nautonomous frequency synchronization can be achieved. \nHowever, an input AC capacitor is needed for each power \nmodule and the system-level protection is not investigated in \nthis paper. In [12], a decentralized control strategy for a \nmodular cascaded converter is proposed, where the switching \nactions and the current regulation are realized by the local \ncontroller based on the local sensors and the local modulator. \nThe master controller only takes charge of coordination, \nreference generation and global protection. For the \nmaster-slave distributed architecture, one of the power module \ncontroller is adopted as the master controller, which processes \nthe tasks of the system-level control with only one power \nmodule’s information and distributes the common duty cycle to \nall other slave controllers. The slave controller also controls the \nisolation DC-DC converter in each cascaded power module \n[10]. A hierarchical distributed control architecture for the \nCHB converters is proposed in [9]. Current tracking is \nperformed through the master control, and the slave control \nbased on consensus algorithm is adopted in order to achieve \npower balance among modules.

Meanwhile, \nfew of papers focus on the dynamic response of the CHB \nconverter-based PET with the distributed control. The main \ncontributions of this paper are as follows: \n1) A novel distributed feedforward control method is \nproposed for CHB converter-based PET, which can balance the \nvoltage and power of each module. Meanwhile, the distributed \ncontrol mode can effectively reduce the number of fibers \nconnected to the central controller. In addition, the proposed \ncontrol method can significantly reduce the calculation and \ncommunication burden of the central controller, and improve \nthe system scalability and expandability. \n2) Feedforward control is added to the distributed control \nmethod which can effectively improve the dynamic response of \nthe system. The PET system can quickly achieve its \nsteady-state after the load disturbance and a smooth start-up \nprocess of the PET system is also achieved. \nThis paper is organized as follows: Section II introduces the \nCHB converter based the PET topology. Section III proposes a \ndistributed feedforward control strategy, which is applied to \nCHB converter-based PET. Simulation results are given in \nSection IV and the conclusion is drawn in section V. \nII. MAIN CIRCUIT OF CHB CONVERTER BASED PET \nThe main circuit of the CHB converter-based PET is shown \nin Fig. 1, which is composed of three phases. Each phase is \ncomposed of a CHB and an input-series-output-parallel \nconnected dual active bridge (DAB) converter. The output of \nthe DAB converter is followed by a three-phase inverter. The \nCHB converter in the rectifier stage is built by low voltage \nrating power devices and it can be directly connected to the \nmedium voltage (MV) grid. The output voltage of the CHB is a \nmultilevel stair case waveform, so a good power quality of the \nMV grid side can be achieved. High frequency transformers are \nemployed in the DAB converters, which transfer the power and \nprovide the galvanic isolation between the high DC voltage side \nto the low-voltage DC bus. The rated voltage and rated power \nof the system can be expanded by using more cascaded power \nmodules [13]. Meanwhile, the low-voltage DC bus and the \nlow-voltage AC port can be connected to different electrical \nfacilities with bidirectional power flow. [14]. The low-voltage \nDC bus can be connected to renewable energy sources or DC \nloads. The low voltage port can be connected to the low voltage \nAC grid or AC loads. \nA\nB\nC\nLg\nLg\nLg\nHigh \nvoltage \nAC\nLow-voltage DC bus voltage\nRectifier stage Isolation stage\nInverter stage\nisa\nisb\nisc\nec\nvDC1\nvDC2\nvDCn\nVL\nVL\nVL\nPower module #1\nPower module #2\nPower module #n\nDC-\nlink\nvoltage\nDC-\nlink\nvoltage\nDC-\nlink\nvoltage\n \nFig.  1. Topology of PET based on CHB. \nIII. DISTRIBUTED FEEDFORWARD CONTROL STRATEGY OF \nCHB CONVERTER-BASED PET \nThe structure of the proposed distributed feedforward control \nfor CHB converter-based PET is illustrated in Fig. 2. In Fig. 2, \nVH-ref is the reference of the DC-link voltage, VL-ref is the \nreference of low-voltage DC bus voltage, udref is the reference \nof the output AC voltage, idref represents feedforward term of \nthe load current. The proposed control structure consists of a \ncentral controller and other local controllers. The central \ncontroller takes charge of the system-level protection and \nreference generation. The local controllers of the power module \nprocesses tasks such as DC-link voltage control, capacitor \nvoltage balance, low-voltage DC bus voltage control and PWM \nLU et al. : A DISTRIBUTED FEEDFORWARD CONTROL METHOD FOR POWER ELECTRONIC TRANSFORMERS 321\nsignals generation based on the local voltage and current \nsensors. The local controller of the inverter takes charge of \noutput voltage and current regulations and PWM signals \ngeneration. Meanwhile, the load current reference idref is fed \nback to the central controller and then it is distributed to each \npower module in order to improve the dynamic response of the \nsystem. The proposed control method regulates the capacitor \nvoltage of the power module based on the local voltage and \ncurrent sensors. Therefore, there is no need to transmit the \nvoltage information of each power module to the central \ncontroller, which greatly reduces the data interaction among the \ncentral controller and the local controllers. The reduction of \ndata interaction can reduce the communication burden of the \ncentral controller, and also increase the modularity and \nscalability of the CHB converter-based PET. \nCHB DAB\nCHB DAB\nCHB DAB\nModule 1\nModule 2\nModule n\nDC/AC\nLocal Controller\n‐Output voltage and \ncurrent regulation\n‐PWM signals generation\nCentral Controller\n‐System-level protection\n‐References generation\nidref\nV-Href\nV-Lref\nudref\n‐ DC-link voltage \ncontrol\n‐PWM signals \ngeneratIon\n‐ Capacitor voltage \nbalance\n-Power balance\n‐Low-voltage DC \nbus voltage control\nLocal Controller\nidref\n \nFig.  2. Proposed distributed feedforward control structure for CHB \nconverter-based PET. \nThe proposed control method can effectively reduce the \ncalculation and communication burden of the central controller \nby comparing the communication architectures of the \ncentralized control and the distributed feedforward control. Fig. \n3(a) shows the communication architecture of centralized \ncontrol method, which can be divided into a central controller, \nan inverter stage local controller, and n local controllers which \nare used to control n modules, where n represents the number of \nmodules. For the centralized control method, the local \ncontroller of each module and the central controller are \nconnected by five optical fibers, and the central controller side \ncontains four output ports and 1 receiving port. Two of the \noutput fiber ports provide PWM signals to the CHB converter, \nand the other two output fiber ports provide PWM signals to the \nDAB converter. The receiving fiber port is a high-speed \ncommunication port, it receives the sensed voltages and sensed \ncurrents as well as the states from local controllers. The central \ncontroller sends the PWM signals to the inverter stage local \ncontroller via three optical fibers, and receives the sensed \nvoltages and sensed currents as well as the states from the \ninverter stage by using one high-speed communication \nreceiving port. Fig. 3(b) shows the communication architecture \nof the proposed distributed feedforward control, which consists \nof a central controller, an inverter stage local controller and n \nlocal controllers which are employed to control CHB \nconverters and DAB converters. From Fig. 3(b), it can be seen \nthat the central controller is connected to the first one local \ncontroller through three optical fiber ports. The local \ncontrollers are connected to each other with the similar optical \nfiber ports. Two of them are high-speed communication ports, \nwhich are used to exchange the data among the central \ncontroller and the local controllers. The other one is a \nlow-speed optical ports, which is employed to transfer the \nsynchronization signal from the central controller to the local \ncontrollers. One of the high-speed communication ports sends \nthe command values V-Href, V-Lref and the feedforward current \nvalue idref to the local controllers. The other one receives the \nstates from the local controllers. The central controller and the \ninverter stage local controller are also connected through three \noptical fibers. The central controller sends the output voltage \ncommand value udref to the inverter stage local controller, \nreceives the states and the feedforward current value idref from \nthe inverter stage local controller. \nCentral Controller\nTX TX TX TX RX\nLocal Controller 1\nRX RX RX RX TX\nTX TX TX TX RX\nLocal Controller n\nRX RX RX RX TX\n......\nLocal Controller (inverter stage)\nTX TX TX RX\nRX RX RX TX\n......\nPWM \nsignals Feedback \ndata\nFeedback \ndata\nFeedback \ndata\nPWM \nsignals\nPWM \nsignals\nHigh-speed\nCommunication port\nHigh-speed\nCommunication port\nHigh-speed \nCommunication port\n \n(a) \nLocal Controller 1\nCentral Controller\nTX\nRX\nTX\nLocal Controller n\nRX\nLocal Controller (inverter stage)\nTX\nRX\nRX\nTX\nRX\nTX\nTX\nRX\nTX\nRX\nRX\nTX TX\nRX\nSynchronization \nsignal\nSynchronization \nsignal\nV-Href\nV-Lref\nV-Href\nV-Lref\nFeedback \ndata\nFeedback \ndata\nudref Feedback \ndata idref\nHigh-speed\nCommunication port\nHigh-speed Communication port\nidref\nidref\n \n(b) \nFig.  3. Different central-local communication architectures. (a) Centralized \ncontrol communication architecture, (b) Proposed distributed feedforward \ncontrol communication architecture. \nFor the centralized control, most of the calculations, such as \nsystem-level control, DC-link voltage control, PWM signals \ngeneration, capacitor voltage balance, power balance control, \nlow-voltage DC bus voltage control, inverter output voltage \n322 CES TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL MACHINES AND SYSTEMS, VOL. 4, NO. 4, DECEMBER 2020 \nand current regulation, are executed in the central controller, \nwhich induces a high computational burden for the central \ncontroller. Meanwhile, the sensed voltages and sensed currents \nas well as the states of each module are fed back to central \ncontroller via the high-speed communication links, which \ninduces a high communication burden for the communication \nnetwork. For the proposed distributed feedforward control, the \ncentral controller only processes the tasks of the system-level \ncontrol, such as system-level protection and references \ngeneration, other calculations are distributed to local controllers, \nso the computational burden for the central controller can be \nsignificantly reduced. Meanwhile, the central controller only \nneeds to receive idref and the states of the local controllers, then \nsend V-Href, V-Lref and udref to the local controllers, the \ncommunication burden for the communication network is also \nreduced. \nFor a PET system with n modules and one inverter stage, the \ncentralized control method needs (5 n+4) optical fibers to \ninterface the central controller to the local controllers, but the \nproposed distributed feedforward control method only needs \nsix optical fibers to interface the central controller to the first \none local controller and the inverter stage local controller and \n3(n-1) optical fibers to interface one local controller to another \nlocal controller. Meanwhile, the proposed distributed \nfeedforward control method has good scalability and \nexpandability and it is easy to expand the number of modules. \nA. Distributed feedforward control of CHB converters \nFig. 4 shows the rectifier stage topology of the CHB \nconverter-based PET. Define Si (i=1, 2, … n) as the switching \nfunction of module i, Tik is the switching state of power device k \nin power module i. When Tik is 1, it means that the power device \nis turned on, and when Tik is 0, it means that the power device is \nturned off.

When the \nswitching function Si is 1, it means that the MV grid charges the \ncapacitor of module i; when the switching function Si is 0, it \nmeans that the module i is bypassed and the MV grid does not \ncharge or discharge the capacitor of module i; when the \nswitching function Si is -1, it means that the MV grid will \ndischarge the capacitor of module i.

For each power module, the \ntime domain circuit equation can be derived: \n( )( ) ( )( ) se tL di t Ri tv t n dt n n                    (4) \nwhere v(t) is the average input voltage of the CHB converter at \ntime t, L is the filter inductance, R is the internal resistance of \nthe MV grid, es(t) is the MV grid voltage, and n is the number of \nmodules. Then the difference equation within a sampling \nperiod can be expressed as: \n  ( )( )( ) ( 1) ( ) s\ns\ne kL Ri kv k i k i kn T n n              (5) \nwhere the sampling period is expressed as Ts. i(k+1) and i(k) are \nthe AC current values under the ( k+1)th and ( k)th sampling \nperiod in turn. It is expected that the ( k+1)th AC current can \ntrack the reference current value, so the reference current value \ncan be replaced by the ( k+1)th AC current. Then the following \nformula can be obtained: \n* ( )( )( ) ( 1) ( ) s\ns\ne kL Ri kv k i k i kn T n n\n          (6) \nIf vDC represents the DC voltage of each power module of the \nCHB converter, the duty cycle of the power device in each \nsampling period can be expressed as: \n( )( )\nDC\nv kD k v                                 (7) \nIncorporating formula (6) into formula (7), the expression of \nthe duty cycle of the power device can be obtained: \n* ( )( )( 1) ( )\n( )\ns\ns\nDC\ne kL Ri ki k i kn T n nD k v\n             (8) \nwhere Ri(k) is the internal resistance of the MV grid, which can \nLU et al. : A DISTRIBUTED FEEDFORWARD CONTROL METHOD FOR POWER ELECTRONIC TRANSFORMERS 323\nbe ignored under the normal circumstances, so the duty cycle of \nthe power device in each power module is obtained as: \n* ( )( 1) ( )\n( )\ns\ns\nDC\ne kL i k i kn T nD k v\n                   (9) \nIn order to keep the output DC voltage of the CHB \nconverter at a fixed reference value, it is necessary to add a \nvoltage outer loop to regulate the average output DC voltage. \nSince the instantaneous power of the AC input side of each \nphase has the double grid frequency fluctuations, the capacitor \nvoltage of the CHB will also fluctuate. As a result, only low \nbandwidth controllers can be used as the voltage outer loop \ncontroller. Reference [16] gives a method to eliminate the \ndouble grid frequency voltage ripple without a low-pass filter, \nand the capacitor voltage can be expressed as: \n2 2( )\nsin(2 )4\ng g g\nDCi DCi i DCi\nDCi\nI LI U\nV v B v tCv\n \n     \n   (10) \narctan( )\ng\ng\nLI\nU n\n                             (11) \nwhere VDCi is the capacitor voltage of power module  i, vDCi is \nthe DC component of the capacitor voltage in the power \nmodule i , Bi is the double grid frequency voltage ripple of \npower module i, Ig is the grid current amplitude, L is the input \nfilter inductance, Ug is the input voltage peak value of each \npower module, and C is the DC-link capacitance, ω is the \nangular frequency of the grid, and n is the number of power \nmodules. \nIn order to further improve the dynamic response of the \nsystem, a load current feedforward control is added to the \ndistributed control of the CHB converter, which forms the \ndistributed feedforward control. Since the input and output \npower of the PET system are equal when the power loss of the \nsystem is neglected, the following formula can be obtained: \n3\n2 2\ndref drefs s u ie i                              (12) \nwhere es and is are the peak values of the input voltage and \ncurrent, and udref and idref are the peak values of the output \nreference voltage and current. So the feedforward coefficient k1, \nwhich represents the ratio of the input current to the output \ncurrent reference, can be expressed as: \n1\n3 drefs\ndref s\nuik i e                              (13) \nThe distributed feedforward control structure of CHB \nconverter is shown in Fig. 5.

The duty ratio \nof the power device in the next sampling period can be \ncalculated based on the input current, MV grid voltage, input \nfilter inductance and reference current of each power module in \nthe current sampling period, and the current and voltage of the \nCHB converter can be controlled. \nThe  phase-shifted  carrier  pulse  width  modulation  (PSC- \n\n\n1\n1\ni\np\nKK s refi\n\n\n\n1DCv\n1si\n\n\n1\n1\ni\np\nKK s refi\n\n\n\n2DCv\n2si\n\n\n1\n1\ni\np\nKK s refi\n\n\n\nDCnv\nsni\n\nk1idref\nB1\nVDC1\n\n\nB2\nVDC2\nVDCn\nBn\nPSC-\nPWM\n\n\n\n\n\n1\nsen\n1\nsen\n1\nsen\nH refV \nH refV \nH refV \nD1\nD2\nDn\nKp2\nKp2\nKp2\nPSC-\nPWM\nPSC-\nPWM\nk1idref\nk1idref\n \nFig.  5.

The \nunbalanced power will cause uneven distribution of the voltage \nor current stress of the switching devices, which will affect the \nnormal operation of the system. Therefore, the power balance \ncontrol of the module is indispensable and is realized through \nthe isolation stage. A control method based on the phase shift is \nemployed to control the power transfer between the primary \nside and the secondary side, which is shown in Fig. 7. In Fig. 7, \nS1p, S4p and S1s, S4s are the switching signals of the primary and \nsecondary power devices; Vp and Vs are the primary side and \nsecondary side voltages of the high frequency transformer; Vp is \nthe high-frequency transformer primary side current; φ is the \nphase-shift angle of the primary side and secondary side \nvoltages of the high-frequency transformer. The output power \nof the isolation stage can be expressed as: \n324 CES TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL MACHINES AND SYSTEMS, VOL. 4, NO. 4, DECEMBER 2020 \n1 / (1 / )\n2\nH L\ns\nNV VP f L\n                      (14) \nwhere N is the primary and secondary turns ratio of the \nhigh-frequency transformer, VH1 and VL are the primary side \nand secondary side voltages of the DAB converter, d is the duty \ncycle, fs is the switching frequency, and L is the leakage \ninductance of the high-frequency transformer. It can be seen \nfrom (14) that the transfer power of the primary and secondary \nsides of the DAB converter is controlled by controlling the \nphase-shift angle φ. \nFig. 8 shows the distributed feedforward control strategy of \nthe DAB converters. Each DAB converter has independent \ncontrol loops, which can improve the scalability and reliability \nof the system and achieve better modularity. The method \neliminating the double grid frequency voltage ripple without a \nlow-pass filter is also adopted in the DAB converter control. In \nFig. 8, vDCi is the sensed input capacitor voltage of the DAB \nconverter, VL is the sensed low-voltage DC bus voltage, VH-ref is \nthe reference of the input capacitor voltage, VL-ref is the \nreference of low-voltage DC bus voltage, φi is the phase-shift \nangle, k2idref represents feedforward term of the load current, \nKp1 and Ki1 are the parameters of the capacitor voltage balance \ncontrol, Kp2 is the parameters of the low-voltage DC bus \nvoltage balance control.  \n1pS\n2 pS\n3 pS\n4 pS\n1sS\n2sS\n3sS\n4sS\nVp Vs\n+\n--\n+\n+\n-\niL\nLp\nVH1 VL\n+\n-\nLs\n \n(a) \n1pS 4 pS\n1sS 4sS\npV\nsV\nt\nt\ntLi\n\n1HV\n \nLV\n2\n- \n \n(b) \nFig.  7. Phase shift control of DAB converter. (a) DAB converter topology, (b) \nPhase shift control of DAB converter. \nFor the i-th DAB converter, the sensed input capacitor \nvoltage vDCi is compared with the reference VH-ref, and the error \nis transferred to the PI regulator to obtain the phase-shift angle \ncompensation value Δφ i, which contributes the capacitor \nvoltage balance control. Meanwhile, the sensed low-voltage \nDC bus voltage VL is compared with the reference VL-ref, and the \nerror is transferred to the PI regulator to obtain a phase-shift \nangle i, which contributes the low-voltage DC bus voltage \ncontrol. These two phase-shift angle components and the \nfeedforward term are combined to generate the final phase-shift \nangle of the DAB converter. \nThe feedforward term is introduced in order to improve the \ndynamic response of the system. Since the output power of \nDAB converters and output power of the PET system are equal \nwhen the power loss of the system is neglected, the following \nformula can be obtained: \n1 / (1 / ) 3\n2 2\nH L\ndref dref\ns\nnNV V u if L\n               (15) \nThe φ/（1-φ/） can be approximately equal to φ/ when φ/  \nis smaller than 0.3.

The \ninverter stage is used to regulate the output voltages and \ncurrents. The inverter is controlled by a local controller, which \nis shown in Fig. 2. In the inverter stage, a current inner loop and \na voltage outer loop are used to regulate the output voltage and \ncurrents. The d-q decoupling control method is adopted in the \ncurrent inner loop and voltage outer loop, as shown in Fig. 9.

Start-up process of the PET \nThe start-up process of the PET is shown in Fig. 10, Fig. 11 \nand Fig. 12. Fig. 10 shows the waveforms of CHB converters \nwhen starting the PET. At the beginning of the start-up ( t<0 in \nFig. 10), all power devices are turned off, the CHB converter is \nin uncontrolled rectifier mode and the DC-link voltage is 742V \nas shown in Fig. 11. At t=0, the CHB converters is started and \nthe DC-link voltage are smoothly charged to 936V. At t=0.1s, \nthe primary side of the DAB is started, the duty cycle of the \nprimary side is linearly changed from 0 to 50% while the power \ndevices of the secondary side are still turned off, the voltage of \nthe low-voltage DC bus is smoothly charged. At t=0.21s, the \nvoltage of the low-voltage DC bus is charged to near the \nsteady-state value 936V. At this time, the gate signals of the \nsecondary side power devices are unlocked and the DAB stage \nis fully started. At t=0.4s, the inverter stage is started and \noutputs power to the load as shown in Fig.12. The start-up \nprocess of the PET system is completed.  \nis\nes\n(a)\n(b)\n \nFig.  10.

The \nDC-link voltage of the each CHB converter is 936V and the \nnumber of power modules for each phase is 11, so the \nmodulation ratio is 0.8, which generates a 19-level voltage \nwaveform, as shown in Fig. 13(b). The application of CHB \nconverter can increase the equivalent switching frequency of \nthe rectifier stage. Meanwhile, the harmonics injecting to the \nMV gird can be effectively reduced.

It can \nbe seen from the simulation results that the DC-link voltages of \nthe eleven power modules are the same, and the voltage of each \npower module fluctuates around 936V with a small fluctuation \nrange. It is proved that the proposed distributed feedforward \ncontrol can achieve a good voltage balance for the input \ncapacitor voltages of the DAB converter.

CONCLUSIONS \nThis paper proposes a distributed feedforward control \nmethod for the CHB converter-based PET to overcome the \ndisadvantages of existing centralized control method. The \nproposed distributed control method assigns most of the \ncomputation to the local controller, so the computational and \ncommunication burden of the central controller is significantly \nreduced. Through distributed feedforward control, each power \nmodule performs the independent control loops by their own, \nwhich makes the system control more modularization and \nimproves the reliability and scalability of the system. \nMeanwhile, a load current feedforward control is introduced to \nDC-link voltage control and the DAB converter control, which \nsignificantly improve the dynamic response of the system. \nFinally, a simulation model is built and the effectiveness of the \nproposed control method is verified.  \n \nREFERENCES \n[1] Li Zixin, Gao Fanqiang, Zhao Cong, et al. \"Research Review of Power \nElectronic Transformer Technologies,\" Proceedings of the CSEE, vol. 38, \nno. 5, pp. 1274-1289, 2018. \n[2] Li Zixin; Wang Ping; Chu Zunfang, et al. \"Research on Medium-and \nHigh-Voltage Smart Distribution Grid Oriented Power Electronic \nTransformer,\" Power System Technology, no. 9, pp. 2592-2601, 2013. \n[3] She, Xu; Huang, AlexQ; Burgos, Rolando. \"Review of Solid-State \nTransformer Technologies and Their Application in Power Distribution \nSystems,\" IEEE JOURNAL OF EMERGING AND SELECTED TOPICS \nIN POWER ELECTRONICS, Vol.1,no. 3, pp. 186-198, 2013. \n[4] Huang, A.Q.; Crow, M.L.; Heydt, G.T.; Zheng, J.P.; Dale, S.J.. \"The \nfuture renewable electric energy delivery and management (FREEDM) \nsystem: The energy internet (Article),\" Proceedings of the IEEE, vol. 99, \nno. 1, pp. 133-148, 2011. \n[5] Li Gong, Ke Dai, Jingjing Chen, et al. “Design and implementation of \ndistributed control system for cascaded H-Bridge multilevel \nSTATCOM,” in Proc. of Conference Proceedings - IEEE Applied Power \nElectronics Conference and Exposition APEC., Fort Worth, TX. 2011. \n[6] Wenxi Yao ; Jian Liu ; Zhengyu Lu , \"Distributed Control for the Modular \nMultilevel Matrix Converter..,\" IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, \nvol. 34, no. 4, pp. 3775-3788, 2019. \n[7] E.
