INTRODUCTION\nIn the last years, multilevel inverters (MLI) have become a\ncompetitive solution against conventional inverters based on\npulse-width modulation (PWM), which are still very popular\nin the market. MLI can be used for uninterruptible power\nsupply (UPS), photovoltaic generators, high voltage direct\ncurrent (HVDC) networks, and generally any DC-AC conver-\nsion application. Among the different advantages attributed\nto these converters, it is worth mentioning a high-quality\noutput voltage associated to a low harmonic distortion, as well\nas a high efﬁciency due to reduced switching frequency in\nsemiconductor devices [1]–[3]. As drawbacks it can be men-\ntioned the large number of elements in the system, the lack\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Atif Iqbal.\nof homogeneity in the voltage and current speciﬁcations of\npower semiconductors and the high complexity of the control\nelectronics. Hence, a great interest prevails today in offsetting\nthese drawbacks.\nMLI can be classiﬁed into three main groups, according\nto their typology: a) diode clamped, b) ﬂying capacitor, and\nc) cascaded MLI (CMLI) [4], [5]. Compared to the other\ntopologies, CMLI have the advantage of using independent\nstages of voltage source inverters (VSI) (conventionally full-\nbridges), which reduces complexity regardless of the desired\nnumber of levels in the output signal. The cascade connection\nof the inverter stages can be carried out through different ways\ndepending on the converter topology, keeping in all of them\nthe need for galvanic isolation in either the DC side or the\nAC side. When galvanic isolation is provided on the DC side,\nseveral independent isolated DC sources are necessary to feed\n98182 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Lopez-Santoset al.: Single-Phase Transformer-Based Cascaded Asymmetric Multilevel Inverter With Balanced Power Distribution\nthe stages of the inverter. On the other hand, using a single DC\nsource requires incorporating low-frequency transformers for\neach inverter stage. These last topologies are known in the lit-\nerature as transformer –based cascaded topologies. Although\ntheir cost can be considerably higher, they are attractive\nwhen regarding control simplicity, robustness and reliability\nprovided by low-frequency galvanic isolation [6]–[8].\nThe conﬁguration of a MLI is deﬁned by the relations\nbetween the amplitudes of the input DC sources. If these\namplitudes are equal, the inverter is denominated symmetric\nand if the amplitudes are different, the inverter is denoted\nasymmetric [9]. On the other hand, for transformer-based\ncascaded topologies fed by a single DC source such as the\nstudied topology, this deﬁnition involves the transformers\nturn ratio: the conﬁguration of the inverter is symmetric if\nthe turn ratios of all inverter stages are equal and asymmetric\nif they are different [10]–[12]. Figure 1 depicts the circuit\ndiagram of a cascaded transformer-based multilevel inverter\nfed by a single DC source.\nFIGURE 1. Transformer- based cascaded multilevel inverter.\nSymmetric conﬁgurations of MLI permit obtaining\n2N +1 output levels from N stages while asymmetrical con-\nﬁgurations allow a higher number of levels depending on the\nratio between the inverter stages. Using a binary geometric\nprogression to deﬁne the ratio between stages, the maximum\nnumber of levels at the output will be 2 N+1 −1. Using a\nternary geometric progression, the number of levels obtained\nwill be 3 N . For example, considering a multilevel inverter\nwith three stages (N=3),a symmetric ratio 1:1:1 allow obtain-\ning a 7-level signal, an asymmetric binary ratio 1:2:4 allows\nobtaining a 15-level signal and an asymmetric ternary ratio\n1:3:9 allows obtaining a 27-level signal. To obtain each level,\nthe converter stages commutate with positive, negative or null\ncontribution. The way in which the stages of the inverter\nare commutated to obtain different levels is deﬁned as a\nswitching pattern. As it can be noted, after analyzing the case\nbased on geometric progression of ratios, there is a single way\nto commutate the inverter stages to obtain each desired level.\nHowever, for symmetric ratios, there are multiple possible\nswitching patterns building the same output signal and giving\nadditional properties to the inverter operation [13].\nFIGURE 2. Symmetrical configurations for generation of the multilevel\nsinusoidal signal from three inverter stages: a) conventional switching\npattern; b) voltage balanced switching pattern; and c) voltage and power\nbalanced switching pattern.\nIn Figure 2a depicts the conventional switching pattern for\na three stage symmetric MLI. As it is observed, the three\nstages operate in unbalanced voltage and power regime.\nIn Figure 2b, the switching pattern balances the voltage distri-\nbution of the inverter but not the power regime. This feature is\nevident by regarding that the voltages have a different phase\nshift with respect to the output voltage and in consequence\nwith respect to the output current. In Figure 2c, the switching\npattern yields a balanced operation in voltage showing a two-\ncycle symmetry.\nAs a particular case, Figure 3 shows a possible switching\npattern balancing voltage and power of the inverter using\nVOLUME 7, 2019 98183\nO. Lopez-Santoset al.: Single-Phase Transformer-Based Cascaded Asymmetric Multilevel Inverter With Balanced Power Distribution\nFIGURE 3. Repeating sequence method for generation of the multilevel\nsinusoidal signal from three inverter stages.\nthe repeating sequence method. In this case, balanced power\ndistribution is obtained after a period of three-cycles of the\noutput voltage. Using this method, balanced power distribu-\ntion for symmetric inverters is relatively easy to be imposed\nby the control.\nFor three inverter stages, the simpler asymmetric ratio\n1:2:4 depicted in Figure 4 (bottom) allows obtaining a\n15-level signal and yields an unbalanced power distribution\nof 15.01%:36.03%:48.96%. The ternary ratio 1:3:9 shown\nin Figure 4 (top) allows obtaining 27-levels and results in a\ndeﬁcient power distribution of 3.47%:15.14%:81.39% [8].\nTo overcome this drawback, other asymmetric conﬁgu-\nrations have been proposed in the literature using the ratio\n1:1:3, namely, 11-levels as depicted in Figure 5 (top) showing\na power distribution of 20%:20%:60% and the ratio 1:2:6,\nproviding 9-levels as depicted Figure 5 (bottom) and showing\na power distribution of 11%:22%:66% [14]. In this last work,\nthe power balance is slightly improved at expenses of an\nadditional pulse width modulation (PWM) control to ensure\na high-quality of the output signal. To the best of the authors’\nknowledge, combination 16:4:1 is qualiﬁed as optimal for\nthree stages corresponding it to the quaternary ratio (43-levels\nsignal). Since not all levels can be produced with this ratio,\na high frequency control is required to produce a high quality\noutput signal [14].\nThe use of four inverter stages in transformer-based MLI\ntopologies is limited because the additional transformer con-\nsiderably increases the cost and size of the inverter without\nadding signiﬁcant advantages to the signal quality. A sym-\nmetric relation was used in [15] for a four stage inverter\nproducing a nine levels output signal. Because of the reduced\nnumber of levels, the voltage quality without control is poor\nand requires a feedback control loop and high frequency\ncommutation to reduce the THD. The asymmetric binary ratio\n1:2:4:8 was used in [16] providing a 31-level output signal\nwith a power distribution of 7.79%:17.83%:25.79%:50.58%,\nthat result being the closest comparison reference for this\nFIGURE 4. Asymmetrical configurations for generation of the multilevel\nsinusoidal signal from three inverter stages.\nwork. By using a ternary ratio between stages 1:3:9:27, an\n81-level signal is produced increasing considerably the qual-\nity of the output voltage. For this ratio also the power dis-\ntribution between stages of 0.75%:5.39%:16.40%:77.46% is\ndeﬁcient. The output signals of the inverter stages for binary\nand ternary asymmetric ratios are depicted in Figure 6.\nImproving the voltage and power distribution between\nstages depends on the ﬂexibility of the inverter topology and\nthe ratio between stages. Several methods has been presented\nuntil now in literature looking for uniform power distribu-\ntion or charge balance control as it has been deﬁned by\nsome authors [17]–[20]. Until now, the only way to obtain a\nhighly accurate uniform power distribution has been reported\nfor symmetric inverters using the repeating sequence method\ndepicted in Figure 3. This paper presents for the ﬁrst time\nthe use of the asymmetric ratio 6:7:8:9 in a four level cas-\ncaded multilevel inverter allowing to produce until a 35-level\nsignal in which optimization of the switching pattern leads\nto a highly balanced power distribution.

A signal\nof 31-levels was selected as nominal, producing also 29 or 33\nlevels when the output voltage increases or decreases outside\nof a deﬁned range because of variations in the input DC\nvoltage or the load.

A complete\ndescription of the inverter topology, its principle of opera-\ntion and design are presented in section II.

CASCADE ASYMMETRICAL TRANSFORMER-BASED\nMULTILEVEL INVERTER\nThe selected transformer- based topology corresponds to\nFigure 1 when the number of inverter stages is four. The fol-\nlowing subsections give fundamentals to understand inverter\noperation and design its components.\nA. OBTAINING THE MULTILEVEL OUTPUT SIGNAL\nFor N cascaded stages, the output voltage of the inverter is\ncomputed as follows\nvo (ωt)=v1 (ωt)+v2 (ωt)+···+ vN (ωt)\n=\nN∑\nk=1\nvk (ωt), (1)\nFIGURE 6. Conventional asymmetric configurations for generation of the\nmultilevel sinusoidal signal from four inverter stages.\nwhere v k (ωt) is the instantaneous output voltage of each\nstage which is deﬁned by:\nvk (ωt)=VdcTRk SFk , (2)\nwhere V dc is the magnitude of the DC input voltage, T Rk is\nthe turns ratio of the transformer of each k stage, and S Fk is\nthe instantaneous switching function of each k stage. For the\nsubsequent analysis, S Fk takes the values −1, 0 or 1. Thus,\nthe sum of the output of the stages allows obtaining a signal\nwith M positive integer levels.\nConsidering that the desired output voltage is V max sin ωt,\nthe relation between the signal of M positive levels and the\namplitude of this reference is deﬁned as K m = Vmax/M.\nFor example, in Figure 7, the higher positive level of the\nsignal is 5 and the desired amplitude is V max =120\n√\n2, then\nKm =24\n√\n2.\nIn this paper, the voltage signal is deﬁned considering that\nthe time during which the output voltage signal remains in\na voltage level is deﬁned by the coincidence of the middle\npoint between levels with a pure sine wave as it is illustrated\nVOLUME 7, 2019 98185\nO. Lopez-Santoset al.: Single-Phase Transformer-Based Cascaded Asymmetric Multilevel Inverter With Balanced Power Distribution\nFIGURE 7. 11-level approximation of a sinusoidal signal during the first\nhalf of the positive semi-cycle (M=5).\nin Figure 3. In the ωt axis, θm determines the end of the m\ninterval and the starting point of the following interval, so that\nit can be expressed in radians for m =1, 2, 3...M as follows:\nθm =sin−1\n(2m −1\n2M\n)\n(3)\nThen, each level is deﬁned for the interval [θm,θm+1].\nBecause of the symmetry of the sinusoidal signal, the sec-\nond half of the positive semi-cycle is obtained by inversely\nreproducing the ﬁrst half semi-cycle, while the negative semi-\ncycle is obtained by multiplying by -1 the voltage levels used\nin the positive semi-cycle. Output signal building based on\nθm angles is summarized in table 1.\nTABLE 1. Optimized switching function for 31-levels signal.\nAs it can be observed in Figure 7, the multilevel signal\nis drawn between two envelopes with one level of dif-\nference between them. Thus, the desired signal can be\ngenerated by means of either an open loop control based\non angles θm, or a closed-loop switched control based on\nthe envelopes in the same way as a hysteresis comparator.\nNonetheless, the analysis and results presented in this paper\nare independent of the control method.\nB. THD AND RMS AS FUNCTIONS OF THE NUMBER\nOF INTEGER LEVELS\nThe number of levels from which the sinusoidal signal is\nobtained determines the total harmonic distortion (THD) of\nthe output voltage. Hence, with a higher number of levels,\nwe obtain a lower harmonic distortion, but a greater amount\nof stages is also required in the inverter. The root mean\nsquare (RMS) value of the output signal of the inverter also\ndepends on the number of levels but in a smaller proportion.\nTo evaluate the quality of the output waveform, THD and\nRMS values are determined. The RMS value considering the\nsymmetry of the signal is deﬁned by:\nVo =Vmax\nM\n√M2 −2\nπ\nM∑\nm=1\n(2m −1)sin−1\n(2m −1\n2M\n)\n(4)\nOn the other hand, the output signal deﬁned from the\nFourier series expansion can be expressed as follows:\nvo (ωt)=\n∞∑\nn=1\n(an cos nωt +bn sin nωt)\nThen, considering the odd symmetry of the voltage wave-\nform leads to:\nvo (ωt)=b1 sin ωt  \nvO1 (ωt)\n+\n∞∑\nn=2\nbn sin nωt\n  \nvOh(ωt)\n,\nwhere v o1 (ωt) and v oh (ωt) are the fundamental and har-\nmonic components of the output voltage respectively. Since\nvo1 (ωt)=4Vmax\nπM\n∑M\nm=1 cos θm, the RMS value is:\nVo1RMS = 4V max\nπ\n√\n2M\nM∑\nm=1\ncos\n(\nsin−1\n(2m −1\n2M\n))\n(5)\nThus, the THD can be exactly determined from (4) and (5)\nas:\nTHD =vohRMS\nvo1RMS\n=\n√(voRMS\nvo1RMS\n)2\n−1\nTHD =\n\n√\n\n\nM2 −2\nπ\n∑M\nm=1 (2m −1)sin−1\n(\n2m−1\n2M\n)\n8\n(\n1\nπ\n∑M\nm=1 cos\n(\nsin−1\n(\n2m−1\n2M\n)))2\n\n−1\n(6)\nAs it can be noted, the THD is not dependent on the input\nvoltage Vdc or the transformer ratios T Rk. Figure 8 shows the\nresulting THD as a function of the number of levels for M =3\nand M =12 respectively, when the expected amplitudes are\ndeﬁned by V max=M. As it can be observed, a number of\npositive integer levels higher than 14 is required to obtain\na THD value lower than 3%. Then, having a signal with\n98186 VOLUME 7, 2019\nO.

TRANSFORMERS TURNS RATIO\nThe maximum output voltage V max can be obtained as the\nalgebraic sum of the stage output voltages, each of them hav-\ning a maximum deﬁned by V kmax. Considering a waveform\nwith M positive integer levels which is build using an inverter\nwith N stages, each of one having a weight w k, these weights\ndeﬁne the ratio between stages (w 1 :w2 :w3 :w4). Then,\nthe turns ratio for the transformer of each stage 1 :TRk is\nobtained as the relation between its maximum output voltage\nVkmax and the input voltage V dc. Design can be performed by\nusing the following expression:\nTRk =Vkmax\nVdc\n=wk Vmax\nMVdc\n(7)\nD. OUTPUT POWER OF THE INVERTER STAGES\nThe output voltage of each inverter stage is a square-wave that\ncan be modeled using the Fourier expansion as:\nvk (ωt)=V1k−max sin (ωt)+\n∞∑\nj=2\nVj−max sin\n(\njωt+θj\n)\n, (8)\nwhere V 1k−max is the amplitude of the fundamental com-\nponent and V j−max is the amplitude of the j-th harmonic.\nBy considering a passive load connected to the output of the\ninverter, the output current can be deﬁned as:\nio (ωt)=Imax sin (ωt +ϕ), (9)\nwhere Imax is the amplitude of the output current and ϕis the\nphase shift deﬁned by the load impedance. Current i o (ωt)is\nthe same for all inverter stages because of their output series\nconnection. Then, the real power can be computed as:\n¯P =Imax\n2\n( 4∑\nk=1\nVk1−max cos ϕ\n)\n, (10)\nwhich is consistent with the superposition principle since\nvoltages Vk1 have the same frequency.\nIII. SYNTHESIS OF THE SWITCHING PATTERN\nIn this work, the proposed asymmetrical relation uses\nwk ∈N, and conﬁgures an arithmetic progression leading to\nan optimization problem in the discrete ﬁeld. The selection of\nwk implies ﬁnding a relation between the levels in the stages\nthat allows obtaining not only the entire signal levels through\nthe algebraic sum of them but also an associated redundancy\nproviding a freedom degree for optimization.\nA. REDUNDANCY OBTAINING SIGNAL LEVELS\nBecause the four stages of the inverter are fed by a single\nDC source, the voltage stress in semiconductor devices of\nthe stages is the same. Also, in order to preserve similar\ncurrent stress ratings in the semiconductors, we use in this\napproach consecutive integer weights adopting the succes-\nsion wk=w,w +1,w +2,w +3 to obtain a quarter of cycle\nof an M-level signal (2M+1 levels inverter). By changing w,\nit is possible to ﬁnd more than one solution that yields all\nvoltage levels in an interval between zero and M. This fact\nimplies a redundancy in the way to obtain levels. For example,\nfor M equal to 15, redundancy is found for some values of w in\nthe interval deﬁned by {w, w ∈N:3≤w ≤7}. Figure 9 shows\nthe redundancy distribution as a function of the integer levels\nin the positive half-cycle of the voltage waveform.\nFIGURE 9. Distribution histograms of redundancy vs. levels:\na) 4:5:6:7 ratio; b) 5:6:7:8 ratio; c) 6:7:8:9 ratio; d) 7:8:9:10 ratio.\nA value of w =4 (4:5:6:7 ratio) leads to a major redun-\ndancy in the lower levels, which have a lower duration in the\nvoltage waveform, and then lower relevance. Using w =5\n(5:6:7:8 ratio), distributed redundancy is found for almost all\nlevels, but, the maximum level has not redundancy, which\ncompromises the possible advantages of the resulting ratio.\nWith w =6 (6:7:8:9 ratio), redundancy is obtained in the two\nmore important levels, which has the major duration in the\nvoltage waveform. For w =7 (7:8:9:10 ratio), the 13-th level\nis not obtained and there is no redundancy for the highest\nlevels. Thus, deﬁning the redundancy of each level as R m,\nthe number of possible different sequences to build the output\nwaveform, which is deﬁned as R tot, can be determined as:\nRtot =\nM∏\nm=1\nRm (11)\nVOLUME 7, 2019 98187\nO. Lopez-Santoset al.: Single-Phase Transformer-Based Cascaded Asymmetric Multilevel Inverter With Balanced Power Distribution\nAs a consequence, with 15 positive levels, we have several\nsequences to obtain a quarter cycle of the sinusoidal signal.\nThe total number of possible switching patterns for cases\nin which at least ﬁfteen subsequent levels are possible is\n279.936 for w=4, 186.624 for w=5,and ﬁnally, 31.104 for\nw=6(see Figure 4). Although, the number of possible switch-\ning patterns with lower values of w is higher, the absence of\nredundancy in the maximum level reduces the possibility to\nachieve a balanced power distribution between stages. It is\nworth to mention that with selection of w=6, it is possible to\nobtain also levels 16 and 17, which can contribute to decrease\neven more the THD of the output voltage in some operation\nconditions. Also, these two additional levels can be used by\na controller to keep regulated the RMS output voltage in a\nwider range of load or DC input voltage. The possible ways\nto obtain the seventeen positive integer levels are sketched in\ntable 2.\nTABLE 2. Switching functions of the inverter stages for selected ratio.\nB. POWER DISTRIBUTION BETWEEN STAGES\nConsidering the deﬁnitions in subsection II.D, the average\npower for each inverter stage can be computed as follows:\n¯Pk =ImaxVk1−max\n2 cos ϕ, (12)\nfrom which, the mean value of the total output power is\nobtained as:\n¯P =\n4∑\nk=1\n¯Pk =ImaxVmax\n2 cos ϕ (13)\nThe best power distribution between the inverter stages is\nobtained when the powers ¯Pk are equal. Then, for the studied\ncase, the percentage of power processed by each stage is given\nby (14), having an ideal distribution being obtained when\nthese values are 25% for the four stages.\n¯Pk\n¯P =Vk1−max\n4Vmax\n×100% (14)\nFor each possible sequence, we can compute this percent-\nage for all inverter stages. For example, for a selected switch-\ning pattern, the distribution of an output power of 100 W\nbetween four stages is P 1=15 W,P2=25 W, P 3=40 W,\nand P 4=20 W. Then, the ideal distribution of power is\nPk=100 W/4 =25 W, which corresponds to a 25% of the\ntotal power. Only the power P 2 has not error compared\nwith the ideal condition since the other stage powers are\nlower or higher. Stage P 1 has a deviation from the ideal\ndistribution corresponding to a 40% (10 W/ 25 W), stage P 3\nhas a deviation of 60% (15 W/ 25 W) and P 4 has a deviation\nof 20% (5 W/ 25 W). Our approach of power equalization\nﬁnds the sequence which guarantees the minor deviation for\nall stages. With this aim, the relative error εk for the stage k\nis deﬁned as:\nεk =\n⏐⏐⏐⏐⏐\n¯Pk −¯P\nN\n¯P\nN\n⏐⏐⏐⏐⏐×100%, (15)\nand the set of possible sequences by W ={w ={w1SF1 ,\nw2SF2 ,..., wkSFk },SFk = −1,0,1}. For example, for\nw =6, from (11), the cardinal of W is Card (W)=31104.\nThen, the power balancing problem can be stated as:\nmin\nw∈W\nmax\ni=1,...,N\nϵi (16)\nTo solve the previous optimization problem, the following\nalgorithm can be used:\n• Compute the power of all inverter stages, i.e., obtain Pk\nfor the N stages using (12).\n• For each sequence w ∈ W evaluate ε1,ε2 ...ε N and\nretain εw,max .\n• The optimal solution is obtained by:\nMin\nw ∈W εw,max (17)\nA MATLAB- based algorithm has been implemented to\nsolve this off-line optimization problem. Possible switching\npatterns from Table 2 were organized in consecutive order\nin such a way that the ﬁrst possibility to obtain each of the\n15-th values deﬁnes the tested combination. All resulting\nεw,max are shown in Figure 10, where it is possible to identify\nthe minimum error which is near 2.6%, which corresponds\nto the power distribution 25.61%:25.24%:24.70%:24.45% in\n98188 VOLUME 7, 2019\nO.

The resulting optimized switching function S Fk\nis detailed in table 3 and the waveforms at the output of the\ninverter stages are shown in Figure 11.\nTABLE 3. Optimized switching function for 31-levels signal.\nAs was mentioned before, the proposed ratio 6:7:8:9 allows\nto obtain a 31-level signal like the asymmetric binary ratio\n1:2:4:8. It can be observed an advantageous balancing in\npower distribution. Some additional comparison elements are\ndiscussed below:\n• Although more sophisticated optimization methods can\nbe applied, the proposed method is simple and reliable\nfor the proposed off-line application.\n• The number of commutations in the case of ratio\n1:2:4:8 is lower than in the proposed case.\n• The switching pattern for the proposed ratio implies\nsome bipolar commutations, this not being the case in\nthe binary ratio.\n• Using the proposed ratio, the system has the capability\nto operate with three or two sources and PWM control\nwhich is impossible in the case of the binary ratio.\nFIGURE 11. Output signals of the inverter stages for the optimum\nswitching pattern producing 31-levels signal.\n• The amplitude of the output signals in the proposed case\nis similar which uniﬁes the size of the inverter stages\n(transformers and semiconductor devices).\n• The power distribution is optimal in the proposed case\nand deﬁcient in the case of the binary relation.\n• The size of the required transformers slightly increases\nwith the proposed relation.\nC. CLOSED LOOP CONTROL PROPOSAL\nA hysteresis control based approach is presented to obtain\nclosed-loop regulation of the output voltage. The idea is to\nenforce the RMS value of the output voltage to be con-\nstrained into an acceptable range around the nominal value\nof 110 V (amplitude of around 155 V) by using the optimum\nswitching patterns corresponding to produce between 27 and\n35 levels. As expected the higher the number of levels the\nhigher the quality of the output signal. Although the power\ndistribution is optimized for the ﬁve possible signals, the best\nbalance corresponds to the nominal case of 31-levels. Taking\nmeasurement of the output voltage, it is determined if the\nvoltage increases or decreases outside the hysteresis band\nenforcing the change of the switching pattern as it is depicted\nin Figure 12.\nFor example, consider our inverter as example operat-\ning at nominal conditions providing 110 V reproducing a\n31-level amplitude of 155 V approximately. If the output volt-\nage decreases below the inferior limit of the hysteresis band\n(Nominal – 5%), the control changes the switching pattern\nto provide a 33-levels signal obtaining an output voltage near\nto 111 V . If the output voltage continues decreasing and again\nfalls below the limit of the hysteresis, the switching pattern\nis changed to provide 35-levels obtaining an output voltage\namplitude around 111 V also. The same principle is applied\nwhen output voltage increases. This kind of control provides\na wide range of operation. It is worth to note that, by applying\nVOLUME 7, 2019 98189\nO.

CONVERTER WAVEFORMS AND OUTPUT\nVOLTAGE QUALITY\nFigure 16 shows the oscilloscope captures of the inverter\noutput voltage feeding an output load of 100 W. It is possible\nto distinguish the steps in the voltage signal. Also, the output\nvoltage signals of the four stages of the inverter are depicted,\nshowing that implementation is in good agreement with the\ntheoretical assumptions. The RMS value of the output voltage\nFIGURE 16.

BALANCED POWER DISTRIBUTION AND POWER\nQUALITY MEASUREMENTS FOR RESISTIVE LOAD\nTo assess the accuracy of the power balancing approach,\nseveral tests were realized using resistive loads covering\nthe overall operation range of the inverter. Results for four\nthe tests are shown in Figs.17 and 18 referring to 28, 131,\n198 and 250 W resistive loads. In Figure 17, captures of the\nVOLUME 7, 2019 98191\nO.

As it can be noted,\nthe THD increases with the amount of power demanded by\nthe load and shows values between 1.0% and 3.0%. Power\nfactor and displacement power factor are unitary as expected.\nIn Figure 18, measurements of the output voltages of the four\nstages are organized in a column for each one of the four\npower levels selected for the test.\nFIGURE 18.

For the load of 198 W, a maximum\ndeviation of 7.0% appears in the second inverter stage (w=7).\nFinally, for a power of 250 W, the maximum deviation is\nabout 10.0% and it is present in the fourth stage of the\ninverter (w=9). For all cases, the maximum deviation present\nin one inverter stage is compensated with lower deviations in\nthe other inverter stages.\nThe analysis of the results about uniform power bal-\nance reveals that the maximum deviation increases with the\namount of power demanded by the load, and is related to the\ndifferences appearing in the input currents of the converter\nstages resulting in voltage drops in parasitic resistances.\nD. POWER EQUALIZATION AND POWER QUALITY\nMEASUREMENTS FOR REACTIVE LOADS\nTo test the immunity of the proposed method to the presence\nof reactive power, an inductive-resistive load of 237 V A\n(PF =0.93) was connected to the inverter.

In this case, power deviation increased\nin comparison with a similar amount of power in a resistive\nload. Nonetheless, the THD in the output voltage is consider-\nably low (0.9%).\nFIGURE 20.

CONCLUSION\nThis paper has presented a method to enforce balanced power\ndistribution on a transformer-based cascaded asymmetrical\nmultilevel inverter. The method is founded on the selection\nof an optimal switching pattern for each stage of the inverter\ngiven by an off-line algorithm. The proposal has been devel-\noped using a 31-level output voltage signal obtained from a\nfour- stage common DC source inverter after selecting the\nbest combination of integer weights for the stages of the\ninverter. The output power and harmonic distortion measure-\nments in a 240 V A prototype have shown THD below 3%\nand a balanced distribution deviation lower than 10%. This\nappropriate behavior of the system has been veriﬁed for\nresistive, resistive-inductive and resistive-capacitive loads\nand improves what has been reported as yet in the technical\nliterature.\nIt has been demonstrated that the proposed asymmetric\nratio 6:7:8:9 allows that the inverter can be controlled using\noptimized switching patterns for a subsequent number of\nlevels (27, 29, 31, 33 and 35). The patterns can be stored\nin a digital device to easily support a voltage regulation\ncontrol loop improving the inverter performance while avoid-\ning the use of high-frequency modulation. Current research\nand future work are oriented to this goal together with the\nintegration of fault-tolerant properties in one of the inverter\nstages.\nVOLUME 7, 2019 98193\nO.

The RMS value of the output was\nsettled to 110 V by modifying the DC input voltage when\ninverter fed a 100 W load. The maximum THD measured\nwas 2% while the minimum was of 1%. Power distribution\nfor 27-levels was measured as 29%:23%:26%:22%\n(Theoretical → 27.13%:23.19%:26.60%:23.08%); 27%:\n28%:26%:19% for 29-levels (Theoretical → 25.72%:\n26.90%:27.09%:20.29%); 15%:29%:29%:27% for 33-levels\n(Theoretical → 15.37%:28.84%:28.41%:27.38%). and,\n3%:34%:32%:31% for 35-levels (Theoretical → 5.51%:\n30.31%:32.08%:32.10%). It is worth to highlight that this\nresults are in good agreement with the theoretical ones show-\ning only slight deviations which can be attributed to voltage\ndrops in parasitic elements.

Some details of the platform\ncan be found in [22]. A reduced version of the software\ncomponent has been developed to share it as a part of this\npaper facilitating the use of its contributions. The link below\ngive access to the installer of the LabVIEW application. The\nsimulation version of RT-MLI whose graphical interface is\ndepicted in Figure 22 has been organized in four theoretical\nframes providing the following functions:\nTheory 1:This frame allows building of the multilevel sine\nsignal using the principle presented in section II by conﬁg-\nuring a desired number of levels. A slide control provides a\nvisual tracking of the different segments of the signal. The\nmain objective of this frame is to facilitate the understanding\nof the signal generation process with some interactivity for\nusers (Figure 22a).\n98194 VOLUME 7, 2019\nO. Lopez-Santoset al.: Single-Phase Transformer-Based Cascaded Asymmetric Multilevel Inverter With Balanced Power Distribution\nTheory 2: This frame provides the user with a complete\noverview of the waveforms of the inverter which are syn-\nchronously visualized with the output of the inverter as\nthe sum of these signals. Furthermore, the user can acti-\nvate or deactivate stages regarding fault scenarios. Addition-\nally, this section evaluates the THD and the RMS of the output\nsignal as a function of the number of stages (1-6) and the num-\nber of levels (1-17) providing elements to easily understand\nthe selected number of stages and levels (Figure 22b).\nTheory 3: This frame allows the user to visualize the\nwaveforms for each stage, as well as the sum of these signals,\nand the computation of power distribution between stages and\nthe error. The user can change the number of levels between\n13 and 17 levels. Also, the user have the possibility to choose\nbetween a set of switching patterns including the best ones\nand the worst ones showing power balance as quality indica-\ntor (Figure 22c).\nTheory 4:In this frame, the hysteresis-based closed-loop\napproach is illustrated showing the operation point of the\nconverter as a function of deviation factor (deviation from\nnominal operation point). The inverter can work producing\nbetween 13 and 17 levels changing from a switching pattern\nto other depending of the measurement of the output volt-\nage amplitude with respect to the deﬁned hysteresis band\n(Figure 22d).\nREFERENCES\n[1] J.
