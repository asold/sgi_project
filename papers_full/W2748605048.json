    "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to describe the measurement system and procedure for amount determination and fast Fourier analysis of inrush current which occurs during switching of unbiased transformer on electric grid.This current can reach high amounts and threaten transformer isolation, other transformers and consumers in area.Short introduction in problematic of inrush current phenomena will be presented.In paper the correct measurement settings for inrush current wave form acquisition will be given.Analysis of inrush current waveform in purpose of higher harmonic determination will be given and explained.Usage of gained results in purpose of simulation model evaluation will be explained.The usage of measurement system in purpose of identification of other effects which inrush current can cause will be proposed.",
