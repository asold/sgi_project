  "abstract": "Abstract. The rapid development of remote sensing technology has led to an exponential growth in satellite images, yet their inherent complexity often makes them difficult for non-expert users to understand. Natural language, as a carrier of human knowledge, can bridge the gap between common users and complicated satellite imagery. Additionally, when paired with visual data, natural language can be utilized to train large vision–language foundation models, significantly improving performance in various tasks. Despite these advancements, the remote sensing community still faces a challenge due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality vision–language datasets for satellite images. To address this challenge, we introduce a new image–text dataset, providing high-quality natural language descriptions for global-scale satellite data. Specifically, we utilize Sentinel-2 data for its global coverage as the foundational image source, employing semantic segmentation labels from the European Space Agency's WorldCover project to enrich the descriptions of land cover types. By conducting in-depth semantic analysis, we formulate detailed prompts to elicit rich descriptions from ChatGPT. We then include a manual verification process to enhance the dataset's quality further. This step involves manual inspection and correction to refine the dataset. Finally, we offer the community ChatEarthNet, a large-scale image–text dataset characterized by global coverage, high quality, wide-ranging diversity, and detailed descriptions. ChatEarthNet consists of 163 488 image–text pairs with captions generated by ChatGPT-3.5 and an additional 10 000 image–text pairs with captions generated by ChatGPT-4V(ision). This dataset has significant potential for both training and evaluating vision–language geo-foundation models for remote sensing. The code is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11004358 (Yuan et al., 2024b), and the ChatEarthNet dataset is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11003436 (Yuan et al., 2024c).",
