  "abstract": "The software for innovative tool using Taguchi-methods is developed and evaluated. There are two trials in the innovative tool using Taguchi-methods; First trial is accomplished for selecting important control factors and its optimum region, and Second trial decides the optimum combination of the control factors by more detail trial using only important control factors. The optimum condition regarding cooling system for cutting was investigated for evaluating this innovation tool in the experiment. It is concluded from the result that (1) Innovative tool using the Taguchi-methods was useful for development with short-term and lower cost, and (2) This tool could quickly and exactly decide the optimum cooling condition.",
