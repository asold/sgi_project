    "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Large Language Models (LLMs) recently demonstrated extraordinary capability, including natural language processing (NLP), language translation, text generation, question answering, etc. Moreover, LLMs are a new and essential part of computerized language processing, having the ability to understand complex verbal patterns and generate coherent and appropriate replies for the situation. Though this success of LLMs has prompted a substantial increase in research contributions, rapid growth has made it difficult to understand the overall impact of these improvements. Since a lot of new research on LLMs is coming out quickly, it is getting tough to get an overview of all of them in a short note. Consequently, the research community would benefit from a short but thorough review of the recent changes in this area. This article thoroughly overviews LLMs, including their history, architectures, transformers, resources, training methods, applications, impacts, challenges, etc. This paper begins by discussing the fundamental concepts of LLMs with its traditional pipeline of the LLM training phase. It then provides an overview of the existing works, the history of LLMs, their evolution over time, the architecture of transformers in LLMs, the different resources of LLMs, and the different training methods that have been used to train them. It also demonstrated the datasets utilized in the studies. After that, the paper discusses the wide range of applications of LLMs, including biomedical and healthcare, education, social, business, and agriculture. It also illustrates how LLMs create an impact on society and shape the future of AI and how they can be used to solve real-world problems. Then it also explores open issues and challenges to deploying LLMs in real-world aspects, including ethical issues, model biases, computing resources, interoperability, contextual constraints, privacy, security, etc. It also discusses methods to improve the robustness and controllability of LLMs. Finally, the study analyses the future of LLM research and issues that need to be overcome to make LLMs more impactful and reliable. However, this review paper aims to help practitioners, researchers, and experts thoroughly understand the evolution of LLMs, pre-trained architectures, applications, challenges, and future goals. Furthermore, it serves as a valuable reference for future development and application of LLM in numerous practical domains.&lt;/p&gt;",
