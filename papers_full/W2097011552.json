The attentional\nhypothesis was supported: BOLD response in occipital cortex, particularly in the right hemisphere lingual gyrus, varied\nsignificantly as a function of tool position, increasing contralaterally, and decreasing ipsilaterally to the tool. Furthermore,\nthese modulations occurred despite the fact that participants were repeatedly instructed to ignore the visual stimuli, to\nrespond only to the vibrotactile stimuli, and to maintain visual fixation centrally. In addition, the magnitude of multisensory\n(visual-vibrotactile) interactions in participants’ behavioural responses significantly predicted the BOLD response in occipital\ncortical areas that were also modulated as a function of both visual stimulus position and tool position.\nConclusions/Significance: These results show that using a simple tool to locate and to perceive vibrotactile stimuli is\naccompanied by a shift of spatial attention to the location where the functional part of the tool is used, resulting in\nenhanced processing of visual stimuli at that location, and decreased processing at other locations.

During tool use, the brain\nmust encode objects both visually and somatically, and integrate these\nmultisensory inputs in the control of action. How the brain achieves\nthis has long been of interest [1–2], yet the key issue regarding how\nthe brain integrates multisensory stimuli that arise from different\nlocations has only recently begun to be addressed [3–10].\nDuring a typical study of multisensory integration and tool use,\nhuman neuropsychological patients or healthy participants hold a\ntool in their hand and perform a series of tool use actions. During\nor immediately after this period of tool use, multisensory (typically\nvisual-tactile) stimuli are presented near to or far from the hand\nand tool. It has repeatedly been shown that tool use enhances the\nintegration of multisensory stimuli presented near to the tool, as\ncompared to stimuli presented in other regions in nearby space (for\nreview, see [10]). Such multisensory effects have been demon-\nstrated, for example, in neuropsychological impairments in\ndetecting contralesional tactile stimuli in the presence of\nsimultaneous ipsilesional visual distractors (i.e., crossmodal extinc-\ntion, [3–6,11]), and decreases in healthy human participants’\nability to attend selectively to tactile stimuli, while trying to ignore\nvisual distractors [7–9,12]. In brief, it has been argued that,\nfollowing a short period of tool use, and sometimes as soon as the\ntool is held [10], visual stimuli previously encoded as distant from\nthe hand (in ‘extrapersonal’ space), may be encoded differently, as\nif they were actually close to the hand, in a multisensory\nrepresentation of nearby ‘peripersonal’ space.\nSuch changes in the processing of visual and tactile stimuli have\noccurred following a variety of different tool use behaviours of\nvarying complexity, from simply holding a long stick and orienting\nits’ distal end towards a visual stimulus [13–14], using a stick to\npoint to locations in space or to bisect lines [15–16], crossing and\nun-crossing two sticks or toy golf clubs, one held in each hand,\nover the body midline [12,17], and to the repeated use of a rake to\nretrieve target objects over several minutes [4–6,11]. The fact that\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 October 2008 | Volume 3 | Issue 10 | e3502\nchanges in multisensory integration have been found following\nsuch simple behaviours as holding and orienting a stick towards a\nvisual stimulus, and without the need for any prior training, has\nbeen interpreted as showing that human tool use relies, at least\npartly, on very rapid modifications of multisensory and sensory-\nmotor processing in the brain [10].\nOne important question concerning tool use and multisensory\nintegration remains unanswered: When we hold and use a tool, or\norient its’ functional part towards a particular location, where does\nour multisensory spatial attention go? By multisensory spatial\nattention, we mean ‘spatial attention that is linked across sensory\nmodalities, and/or that has multisensory consequences’ – for\nexample, attending to a location that is defined visually typically\nhas consequences both for the processing of visual and non-visual\nstimuli presented at that location, as compared to at other\nlocations. It seems intuitive, at least to us, that people would\nnaturally pay more attention to the location occupied by the\nfunctional part of the tool, for this is where the crucial multisensory\nand sensorimotor interactions between the tool and the target\nobject occur. Orienting one’s attention to the functional part of the\ntool may thus result in enhanced processing of visual stimuli at that\nlocation, and perhaps also in suppressed processing of stimuli at\nother locations. We tested this possibility with functional magnetic\nresonance imaging (fMRI).\nWe asked young, healthy human participants to perform a\nsimple task inside an MRI scanner. Their task was to use a long\nwooden rod (the ‘tool’) to locate and discriminate between two\nkinds of target vibrotactile stimuli (single continuous, and double\npulsed vibrations) presented at the distal (functional) tip of the tool,\napproximately 60 cm away from the participants’ hands. The\nvibrotactile stimuli were generated by stimulators positioned on a\ntable over the participants’ legs. Participants were instructed to\nignore the simultaneously-presented visual distractor stimuli, and\nto make a finger button response according to the type of\nvibrotactile target. The visual distractor stimuli were also of two\ndifferent types (continuous and pulsed), but were randomized with\nrespect to the vibrotactile targets, resulting in one of four possible\ncombinations of vibrotactile and visual stimuli being presented on\neach experimental trial. Half of these trials thus contained\n‘congruent’ types of stimuli, the other half contained ‘incongruent’\ntypes. Comparing performance between these two types of trial\nprovided a behavioural measure of multisensory integration. It is\nimportant to note here that ‘congruence’ refers only to the\nrelationship between the target and the distractor that is of\nrelevance to the participants’ discrimination task. In the present\nreport, congruence refers only to the type of stimulus presented\n(continuous vs. pulsed), and not to the spatial location of the stimuli\n(see refs [18,19] for further discussion).\nThis simple task was constant across all experimental condi-\ntions, for all of the participants. The participants were explicitly\ninstructed to ignore the visual distractor stimuli, and to pay\nattention to, and respond only according to the type of vibrotactile\nstimulus (pulsed or continuous), while fixating centrally. To\nindicate their response, participants pressed one of two buttons\nusing the hand opposite to the one holding the tool. At the\nbeginning of half of the ‘rest’ blocks between blocks of the\nvibrotactile discrimination task, the participants were required to\nmove the tip of the tool between one of two target locations, on the\nleft or right of the visual and body midline. All participants trained\non these tasks for at least 15 minutes prior to scanning.\nThere were four types of block in each run of the experiment,\nderived from two spatial stimulus variables: Vibrotactile target\nposition (left or right, Figure 1C), and visual distractor position (left\nor right, Figure 1B). Participants performed the same two tasks in\nall four of these blocks – the only difference between blocks being\nthe relative locations of the vibrotactile target (at the functional tip\nof the tool), and the visual distractor stimuli (Figure 1A). We\nperformed two experiments, with 14 and 13 participants\nrespectively, in which the only difference between the experiments\nwas the hand that participants used to hold the tool and to\nperceive the vibrotactile target (i.e., right and left, respectively).\nThese two tasks were designed to ensure that: a) Participants were\nactively using the tool to perceive the vibrations; b) Participants were\nconcentrating on task performance and fixating centrally, and; c) A\nbehavioural measurement of multisensory integration (i.e., the effect\nof vibrotactile-visual distractor congruency) could be collected\nduring the scanning session. Furthermore, the discrimination task\nwas designed to be difficult to perform (such that participants would\ntypically make ,25% errors, see [9]), and required a constant\nmaintenance of both the position of the tip of the tool, and pressure\nexerted on the tool by the hand, in order that the vibrotactile stimuli\nwould be perceptible. Such tasks have frequently been interpreted\nwithin the literature as ‘active tool use’ (see [10], for review, the\nshort discussion above, the discussion below, and [9], for further\ndiscussion), and thus provide a very simple form of tool use with\nwhich to test the hypotheses presented here.\nIn addition, we designed our behavioural task in order to\nminimize any differences in overall behavioural performance\nbetween experimental conditions (blocks) of the task. In particular,\nwe aimed to eliminate differences in performance based on the\nspatial location of the visual and vibrotactile stimuli, by requiring\nparticipants to perform a non-spatial discrimination on the target\nvibrotactile stimuli [20]. Because the primary contrasts of interest\nin the analysis of the fMRI data involved comparisons between\nsame-side and different-sides visual and vibrotactile stimulation,\nwe aimed to ensure that there were no significant differences in\nbehavioural performance between these conditions. Given such a\ndifference in performance, it would be difficult to assess any effects\nof same-side vs. opposite-sides stimuli in the presence of the\nconfounding effects of different reaction times and error rates,\nattentional load, and error-processing [21,22]. For seven behav-\nioural experiments investigating the subtle spatial modulations of\nperformance that may be found when using the present task, and\nfor further discussion see [9,20].\nIf using the functional part of a tool on one side of space is\naccompanied by a shift of spatial attention to that side (specifically\nto the location of the functional part of the tool), then visual stimuli\npresented near the functional part of the tool should result in\nenhanced BOLD response in retinotopic portions of occipital\nvisual cortex (because they are attended), as compared to the exact\nsame stimuli presented when the tool is positioned elsewhere\n(because these stimuli are now unattended) [21,23–26]. Alterna-\ntively, if participants are able completely to ignore the visual\ndistractor stimuli, as they were explicitly instructed to do, then\nthere should be no effect of stimulus congruency (i.e., no\nmultisensory integration), and, furthermore, no effect of the\nposition of the tool on the processing of visual stimuli in occipital\ncortex. We tested these two alternatives in a two-stage thresholding\nprocedure [27]. First, we defined a volume of interest based upon\nthe two simple effects of visual distractor location: left .right\ndistractors, and right .left distractors. Based on previous results\nand the well-known functional organization of the visual brain, we\nexpected that two clusters of activation would result from these\ncontrasts - primarily in occipital cortex contralateral to the visual\ndistractors. Next, we searched within these volumes for brain areas\nin which the BOLD response varied significantly as a function of\nthe position of the functional part of the tool, with the prediction\nthat a shift of spatial attention to the functional part of the tool\nSpatial Attention and Tool Use\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 October 2008 | Volume 3 | Issue 10 | e3502\nFigure 1.

The participant lay supine in the scanner\nbore, viewing the apparatus via a head-coil-mounted mirror system. A tool (86750 mm wooden dowel) was held in either the participant’s left or\nright hand, and a response box was held in their other hand. The tool was oriented towards the participant’s legs. The tip of the tool was positioned\non either the left or right vibrotactile target stimulator, depending on the condition, and guided by a semicircular rubber guide. The visual distractors\nwere presented with two 10 mm red LEDs, positioned immediately above and behind each vibrotactile stimulator. The vibrotactile and visual\nstimulators were supported on an acrylic table, resting over the participant’s legs.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0003502.g001\nSpatial Attention and Tool Use\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 October 2008 | Volume 3 | Issue 10 | e3502\nshould result in increased BOLD response related to the visual\ndistractor stimuli in the contralateral occipital cortex, and\ndecreased BOLD response in the ipsilateral occipital cortex [21].\nThe resulting clusters would therefore reveal voxels that showed\nboth a significant main effect of visual distractor position, and a\nsignificant influence of tool position on the processing of the visual\ndistractors.\nIn additional analyses, we examined the possibility that the\nvisual and vibrotactile stimuli may activate a ‘hand-centred’ or\n‘tool-centred’ multisensory brain area [10], we examined the\nfunctional and effective connectivity of one occipital area that\nshowed clear tool-position-dependent modulation of BOLD\nresponses, and we also examined the possibility that the\nbehavioural measurement of multisensory interaction would\nsignificantly predict the BOLD response in visual, somatosensory,\nmultisensory, or general attention- or response-related brain\nregions. Finally, we combined the above two analyses in order\nto search for brain regions which showed both a main effect of\nvisual stimulus position within-participants, and a significant\ncovariation between BOLD and our behavioural measures of\nmultisensory integration between-participants.\nResults\nBehaviour\nDuring the scanning sessions, there were large and significant\nbehavioural effects of multisensory congruency (i.e., the difference\nin RT and errors between trials with incongruent and congruent\nstimuli, where congruency is defined solely by the type (single vs.\ndouble) of vibrotactile and visual stimuli). These multisensory\nintegration (MSI) effects were present in multivariate measures\ncombining RT and error scores (F(2,10) = 21.03, p = .0003), as\nwell as separately for RT (F(1,11) = 45.28, p = .00003, mean 6\ns.e.m., MSI = 78612 ms), and errors (F(1,11) = 14.06, p = .003,\nMSI = 1263%, see [9]). These behavioural results demonstrate\nthat strong multisensory interactions occurred during acquisition\nof the fMRI data (Figure S1). These congruency effects were\nslightly larger in general when the tool was held on the right, as\ncompared to on the left, side of visual fixation (p = .013),\nirrespective of which hand held the tool, and the location of the\nvisual distractor.\nAs intended, the position of the visual distractor did not\nsignificantly affect behavioural performance, allowing us to rule\nout simple behavioural differences as potential explanations for\ndifferences in brain activation in the following fMRI contrasts of\ninterest (see also Text S1, Figure S1, and [9,20], for additional\nanalyses of behavioural data). The absence of a significant effect of\nvisual distractor position (i.e., a spatial variable) is not surprising –\nwhen participants perform a non-spatial discrimination task, it is\nactually quite rare to find modulations in performance based upon\nthe spatial locations of the stimuli, provided that adequate control\nover the effects of stimulus-response compatibility is achieved (see\n[20], for further discussion and references). Nevertheless, using the\npresent discrimination task, it is still possible to uncover very subtle\nspatial modulations in performance, given a sufficient sample size\n(e.g., n = 24), a good psychophysical environment, and when\nresponses are executed with the feet [9,20]. Indeed, the task used\nin the present study was designed explicitly, over these seven\nprevious experiments, to minimize any differences in RT and error\nperformance with respect to stimulus location, while allowing the\nuse of single hand-held tool inside the MRI scanner. If RT and\nerror performance had been significantly and strongly affected by\nspatial aspects of the behavioural task, it would have been very\ndifficult for us subsequently to argue that any changes in BOLD\nresponse between conditions with different spatial configurations\nof target and distractor were not simply due to general differences\nin response speed, arousal, vigilance, or error-related processing.\nBy successfully eliminating gross differences in behavioural\nperformance, we can proceed to interpret changes in the BOLD\nresponse more clearly with respect to the experimental variables of\nmost interest – i.e., the spatially-selective influence of the\nfunctional part of a tool on visual processing. For seven\nbehavioural experiments (total n = 196) investigating and discuss-\ning these issues in detail, see [9,20].\nfMRI\nThe fMRI BOLD data were initially analyzed in three ways:\nFirst, we analyzed the within-participant mean BOLD signal\nchanges using contrasts specifying the main factors of the hand used,\ntool tip and vibrotactile target position, and visual distractor\nposition, according to the models presented in Figure 1. Second, we\nanalyzed the between-participant covariation in the magnitude of\nmultisensory integration (as measured with the behavioural\nresponses), and the magnitude of BOLD signal change. Third, we\nrepeated the first analysis, this time restricting the search volume to\nonly those brain regions showing significant activations or\ndeactivations in the second set of (multisensory) analyses. The first\ntwo analyses were performed initially across the whole brain:\nParametric maps of the Z-statistic were thresholded at Z $2.33\n(p#.01), and the size of resulting clusters of activation were assessed\nfor significance against Gaussian Random Field theory, resulting in\na final whole-brain corrected cluster significance of p #.05.\nEffects of visual distractor position and tool tip position\nThe main effect of visual distractor position, as expected, resulted\nin two large clusters of activation, both covering the dorsal and\nventral occipital cortex contralateral to the side of the visual distractor\n(i.e., right occipital cortex was significantly more active for visual\nstimuli to the left of fixation than for right-side visual stimuli, and vice\nversa for left hemisphere occipi tal cortex). To test the potential\nmodulatory effects of tool position, we further searched within each\ncontralateral occipital cluster for regions that showed tool tip position-\ndependent modulations of BOLD response (Z $2.33, p #.01,\nvoxelwise uncorrected, [27]). This analysis revealed those regions\nwhich, for example, showed a higher BOLD response to visual stimuli\npresented on the left as compared to on the right of fixation (the main\neffect of visual distractor position), but also, and critically, showed a\nhigher response to the same left visual distractor when the tip of the\nt o o lw a su s e dn e x tt oi to nt h el e f t ,a sc o m p a r e dt ow h e ni tw a su s e d\non the opposite side (i.e., the effect of tool tip and/or vibrotactile\ntarget position). In the following analyses, it is important to note that,\nin testing the visual and tool tip position effects, the contribution of the\nhand that holds the tool is effectively ignored - these analyses were\nperformed by collapsing across the variable hand, and in any case the\nBOLD signal changes of interest were independent of which hand\nheld the tool (data reviewed but not shown). Furthermore, note that\nthe tool was present and remained stationary for at least 12 s (and, for\nhalf of the blocks, 36 s) before the start of each experimental block –\nthis aspect of the design ensured that all activations and deactivations\nwhich were time-locked to a block of trials, reflected significant\nchanges with respect to a baseline in which the tool was also present.\nIn short, the presence of the tool, as an additional visual stimulus,\ncannot have been responsible for modulating the BOLD signal\nrecorded during the task blocks. The possibility that these two\nindependent visual stimuli (the distractor and the tip of the tool) in the\nsame region of the visual field led to an interaction or non-linear\nsupra-additive summation, of BOLD responses is considered in detail\nin the Discussion.\nSpatial Attention and Tool Use\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 October 2008 | Volume 3 | Issue 10 | e3502\nWithin the clusters identified by the main effects of visual\ndistractor position, several areas in occipital cortex showed tool tip\nposition-dependent modulation of BOLD response, evidenced as\nboth increases and decreases in BOLD signal with respect to the\nbaseline. Significant increases in BOLD signal were found in\noccipital cortex contralateral to the visual distractor when the tip of\nthe tool was used on the same side of fixation as the visual\ndistractor (as compared to when it was used on the opposite side).\nConversely, significant decreases in the BOLD response were\nobserved in the occipital cortex ipsilateral to the visual distractor,\nwhen the tip of the tool was used on the opposite side of fixation to\nthe visual distractor (as compared to on the same side). These data\nare shown in Figure 2A–D, Table S1, and as detailed below.\nRight occipital cortex activations.Using the tip of the tool to\nperceive vibrotactile stimuli on the left of fixation (as compared to on\nthe right) increased the BOLD response resulting from a left visual\nstimulus, in a portion of the right lingual gyrus (peak Z-statistic = 3.55,\n(20, 268, 22), Figure 2B), in an area that probably lies close to the\nborder of retinotopic visual areas VP, V2, and V4v, representing the\nhorizontal meridian in the left visual field, where the visual stimuli\nwere presented [24,28]. This region has previously been activated in\ntasks involving visual spatial attention [25], and by the selection of\nvisual and tactile targets for eye movements [29]. This cluster of right\nhemisphere lingual gyrus voxels also showed a significant decrease in\nBOLD response for right visual stimuli when the tip of the tool was\nused on the right side of fixation (as compared to when used on the\nleft, see below). Additional tool tip position-dependent increases in\nBOLD signal following right visual stimuli were observed in the right\nposterior intraparietal sulcus and the superior (Z = 2.50, (32, 280,\n40)), and inferior divisions of late ral occipital cortex (Z = 2.34, (50,\n278, 16)). A nearby site in the superior division of the lateral occipital\ncortex (24, 282, 38) was previously shown to be activated in a task-\nindependent fashion by spatially-congruent visual and vibrotactile\nstimulation [30]. The superior lateral occipital region activated in the\npresent study is close to a region activated more strongly by spatial\nthan by orientation visual discriminations [26].\nLeft occipital cortex activations. When the tool tip was\nused to perceive vibrotactile stimuli on the right side of fixation,\nwith a concurrent right visual distractor (as compared to on the left\nside, away from the same stimulus), the BOLD response in left\noccipital cortex was enhanced, with the peak voxel lying in\nprimary visual cortex (Z = 2.87, ( 214, 286, 14), Figure 2A),\naccording to probabilistic cytoarchitecture [31]. This portion of\nvisual cortex has previously been activated during saccades to\nvisual and tactile targets [32], and has been argued to show supra-\nadditive summation of visual and auditory inputs [33, though see\n27], suggesting a significant role for primary and secondary visual\ncortices in a number of multisensory integration tasks.\nRight occipital cortex deactivations. Tool tip position-\ndependent decreases in BOLD response were also observed in the\nright occipital cortex. Activity related to visual stimuli presented on\nthe right of fixation, in the right superior and inferior divisions of\nlateral occipital cortex (Z = 23.57, (20, 286, 18), Figure 2C;\nZ= 22.66, (48, 288, 26), Figure 2D), probably the dorsal portion\nof V3 [28,34], and in the right occipital pole (Z =22.34, (14, 292,\n28)), probably comprising part of visual area V2 [34], was\nsignificantly lower when the tool tip was used on the right side of\nfixation as compared to on the left.\nTool-position-dependent increases and decreases in\nBOLD response within the same voxels.We noticed that a\nFigure 2.

We\ntherefore performed an additional contrast, which assessed tool-\nposition-dependent increases and decreases simultaneously. This\ncontrast searched for areas in which the effect of visual stimulus\nposition (either left.right or right.left) was larger when the tip of the\ntool was present next to the visual stimuli as compared to the effect of\nvisual stimulus position when the tool was on the opposite side (i.e.,\nfor left .right visual stimuli: [TLVL .TRVR].[TRVL.TLVR],\nand similarly for right.left visual stimuli). This contrast was assessed\n(voxelwise, p,.05, Bonferroni corrected) within a search volume\nrestricted by a number of functionally-relevant criteria. We restricted\nthe search volume to those voxels which: a) Showed a significant main\neffect of visual stimulus side (voxelwise Z$2.33, p,.01, whole-brain\ncluster corrected to p,.05); b) Showed an increased response (Z.0,\np,.5, uncorrected) when the tool was next to the contralateral visual\ndistractor as compared to when positioned ipsilaterally (e.g.,\n[TLVL.TRVL]), and; c) Showed a decreased response (Z ,0,\np,.5, uncorrected) when the tool was next to the ipsilateral visual\ndistractor as compared to when positioned contralaterally (e.g.,\n[TRVL.TRVR]). This multi-stage masking procedure resulted in a\nsearch volume of 6,409 voxels in the right hemisphere occipital\ncortex, and 3,118 voxels in the left hemisphere occipital cortex. The\nonly brain region to survive these stringent multiple statistical criteria\nwas a cluster of 13 voxels in the right hemisphere lingual gyrus, with\npeak Z-statistic of 3.93 and MNI coordinates: (18,266, 22).\nIn summary, the analysis of the effects of tool position on the\nspatial processing of visual stimuli revealed clusters of activation\ncontralateral to the visual stimuli, and clusters of deactivation\nipsilateral to the visual stimuli. Of most prominence, a region in\nthe ventral occipital cortex, most likely at the border of areas V2\nand VP, showed both contralateral activations, and ipsilateral\ndeactivations, depending on the relative positions of the tip of the\ntool and the visual distractors. Activity in this area of the right\nlingual gyrus showed clear modulations of visual processing during\ntool use. In analyses reported below, this area will also be shown to\nmodulate its activity significantly as a function of the behavioural\nmeasures of multisensory integration, both in RT and percentage\nerror measurements.\nSince the BOLD response in the right lingual gyrus was sensitive\nto the position of the tool relative to the visual distractor on both\nsides of space, and also varied as a function of the behavioural\nmeasures of multisensory integration, we further analysed the\n‘functional-’ and ‘effective-connectivity’ of this area. The raw\nsignal, and the raw signal multiplied by +1 for task-, and 21 for\nrest-related epochs respectively, was entered as a regressor for each\nparticipant and run separately. Group analyses (voxelwise\nthreshold of Z $3.09, p #.001, whole-brain cluster corrected,\np#.05) revealed that BOLD signal in widespread regions of\nbilateral dorsal, ventral, and lateral occipital cortex, bilateral\nsuperior and middle temporal gyri, and bilateral insula, thalamus,\nand putamen, covaried with signal in the right lingual gyrus\n(‘functional connectivity’). This large cortical territory may in part\nreflect vascular or other processes of little interest, so we further\nassessed the ‘effective connectivity’ of the right lingual gyrus.\nSignal covariation that was stronger during task periods than rest\nperiods was restricted to bilateral portions of the occipital lingual\nand fusiform gyri, bilateral intracalcarine sulcus, and lateral\noccipital cortex in both hemispheres. These analyses suggest that,\nduring the task periods, the right lingual gyrus functioned together\nwith numerous regions in bilateral occipital cortex.\nIn an additional analysis, we searched for brain regions which\nshowed a significant interaction between the positions of the visual\ndistractor and the tip of the tool, both for the two hands\n(experiments) together, for each hand (experiment) separately, and\nfor the three-way interaction including the factor of which hand\nheld the tool (experiment). Such regions might be predicted to\nexist based on the idea of hand-centred or tool-centred processing\nof multisensory stimuli during tool use [10]. No such regions were\nfound in the present datasets, either when searching across the\nwhole brain, or restricting the search volume to just frontal and\nparietal sensory-motor areas (defined operationally as the\napproximate borders of Brodmann’s areas 5, 6, 7, 8, 39, 40, 44,\nand 45, by creating a mask in MRICro, using canonical\nBrodmann area maps, overlaid in standard MNI space and\nsmoothed with a 3D isotropic 4 mm FWHM filter to accommo-\ndate anatomical variability and imprecision). For comparison with\nthe principal analyses reported in the present manuscript,\nuncorrected peak voxel coordinates and statistics for the\ninteraction effects are provided in Table S2. Possible reasons for\nthis failure to find significant hand- or tool-centred activations are\ndiscussed below. All other potentially relevant contrasts were\nexamined within the factorial design of our experiments, for\nexample, the simple effects of hand used, and the interaction\nbetween hand used and tool position. None of these additional\ncontrasts resulted in any significant clusters of activation, and were\nnot, in any case, of interest in the present report, so are not\ndetailed further.\nCovariation of BOLD with behavioural measure of\nmultisensory integration\nIn the second set of analyses, we used the behavioural\nmeasurements to search for activity reflecting processes of\nmultisensory integration. Mean RT and percentage error scores\nwere calculated for each participant and for each of the eight\nconditions, the across-participant mean was subtracted from each\nscore, and the scores were then entered as predictors in whole-\nbrain analyses separately for RT and error scores. Contrasts were\nspecified to highlight activity that significantly covaried (either\npositively or negatively) with the behavioural measures of\nmultisensory integration.\nMultisensory integration, as indexed by RT measurements,\ncovaried positively with BOLD response in the right hemisphere\nmiddle and superior frontal gyri (pre-frontal eye field (pre-FEF)\nand dorsal premotor cortex, Z = 5.48, (32, 10, 62), pre-supple-\nmentary motor area (pre-SMA), Z = 4.40, (12, 24, 60), extending\nmedially and inferiorly into the medial surface of the superior\nfrontal gyrus (Z = 4.59, (4, 32, 48), Figure 3A), and the border of\nthe anterior cingulate (Z = 3.51, (8, 0, 46)). A full list of peak voxel\ncoordinates is provided in Table S3. A similar analysis for the\npercentage of errors revealed four clusters of activation (Figure 3B\nand Table S3). One cluster overlapped considerably with the\nactivation related to RTs in the superior and medial frontal gyrus.\nThis overlap was not unexpected, given the high correlation\nbetween RT and error scores (left hand tool use, r(12) = .83, right\nhand tool use, r(12) = .62, both p#.05). Together, these activations\nin dorsal premotor cortex, pre-FEF, pre-SMA, and the anterior\ncingulate likely reflect between-participants variation in neural\nprocessing related to response selection, the resolution of response\nconflicts, and the error-related processing that would frequently\noccur on incongruent trials [35–36].\nThe cerebellar vermis showed the strongest correlation with\npercentage errors (Z = 6.78, (8, 252, 26)), and this activation\nextended into the right cerebellar hemisphere (Z = 4.35, (18, 236,\n222), Figure 3B). These activations likely reflect additional\nsensorimotor components of multisensory task performance. The\nlargest regions of activation were found in occipital cortex\nSpatial Attention and Tool Use\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 6 October 2008 | Volume 3 | Issue 10 | e3502\nbilaterally, including the inferior and superior divisions of lateral\noccipital cortex, and extending into the middle temporal gyrus,\nprecuneus, and parietal-occipital sulcus. These large clusters\nincluded activation of both primary and secondary visual cortex\n(peak Z = 4.84, ( 218, 298, 10)), along with bilateral regions of\nextrastriate cortex. Nearby activation peaks have been reported in\nassociation with attending to vision over touch [32,37–39], shifting\ncompared to holding visual attention [40], and in visual-haptic\npriming [41]. Several of these regions lie close to the region\nidentified as the lateral occipital tactile-visual area by Amedi and\nhis colleagues (LOtv, [42]).\nIn summary, activity in midline and lateral cerebellum, right\nhemisphere medial and superior frontal cortex, and lateral\noccipital cortex covaried significantly and positively with the\nbehavioural measures of multisensory integration. A number of\nother regions showed significantly negative covariation with\nFigure 3. Activity positively correlated with multisensory integration. A: RT measures;B: % error measures. Clusters of activation show brain\nareas in which the BOLD response significantly covaried with the magnitude of multisensory integration across participants, overlaid on a standard\nbrain in MNI space.

Together, activity\nin the regions identified by the behavioural covariate contrasts\nexplained a large proportion of the variance in the behavioural\nmeasures. These regions are likely to be responsible for directing\nattention to touch in the presence of visual distractors, to the\nintegration of the multisensory stimuli, for detecting and resolving\nthe response conflicts associated with selecting responses in the\npresence of incongruent multisensory cues, and for error-related\nprocessing.\nReference frames for multisensory integration\nWe performed three further analyses, combining the two\ndifferent sets of analyses reported above. First, we examined the\npeak Z-statistics for the voxels identified by the simple effects of\nvisual distractor position, tool tip position, hand used, and their\ninteractions, as reported above (see Table S1 & Table S2). Of the\nnine peak voxels identified (from non-significant clusters within the\n‘sensory-motor’ volume of interest described above, with a\nvoxelwise uncorrected Z$2.33, p#.01) in the interaction between\nvisual distractor position and tool tip position, only one of these\nvoxels also showed a significant effect (voxelwise uncorrected\nZ$2.33, p #.01) in the multisensory behavioural covariate (RT)\ncontrast. This voxel was located in the middle frontal gyrus, anterior\nto the frontal eye fields ((30, 12, 60), ‘pre-FEF’ [43]). Conversely, of\nthe seven peak voxels identified by the simple effects of tool position\nwithin the significant clusters defined by the simple effects of visual\ndistractor positions, three voxels showed significant positive effects\nin both the multisensory (RT) and the multisensory (error) contrasts\n(in right primary, secondary, and extrastriate visual cortices, (14,\n292, 28), (20, 268, 22), (44, 284, 26)).\nSecond, we examined the distributions of Z-statistics across all the\nvoxels identified by the three multisensory contrasts (i.e., the\ncontrasts identifying positive correlations with RT and errors, and\nthe negative correlation with errors, Figure 4). The population of\nvoxels positively correlated with multisensory integration (errors)\nshowed a wide distribution of Z-statistics for the simple visual effects,\nfrom 27.51#Z#7.87, with mean positive and negative Z-statistics\nof 2.15, and 22.39, respectively for the VL .VR and VR .VL\ncontrasts. These data indicate a strong shift in the distribution\ntowards a significant preference for contralateral over ipsilateral\nvisual stimuli, across the population of 11,313 voxels. Conversely,\nthe range of Z-statistics for the interactions between visual distractor\nposition and tool tip position was much reduced (22.97#Z#2.55),\nand the mean Z-statistics for the four relevant contrasts were+0.50,\n+0.52, and 20.63, 20.83, respectively. Neither the positive\ncorrelation with RTs, nor the negative correlation with percentage\nerrors, showed any strong trends in any contrasts.\nThird, and more formally testing the above two analyses, we re-\nassessed the main effects, simple effects, and interactions reported\nin the very first set of analyses, this time restricting the search\nvolume to the volume defined by the 11,313 voxels showing\nsignificant BOLD covariation (voxelwise p #.01, whole-brain\ncluster-corrected, p #.05) with the behavioural measures of\nmultisensory integration. Only the simple visual contrasts resulted\nin any significant clusters of activation (Figure 5, Bonferroni-\ncorrected across the search volume). Activation peaks were located\nin the superior and inferior divisions of the lateral occipital cortex,\nthe fusiform, and lingual gyri.\nDiscussion\nThe experiments reported here were designed to determine\nwhether holding and using a tool on one side of space is\naccompanied by a significant modulation of visual processing for\nstimuli presented on that side, near to the functional part of the\ntool. The data indeed supported this conclusion. Clusters of voxels\nin occipital cortex contralateral to the visual stimuli showed\nincreased BOLD responses when the tip of the tool was held and\nused next to the stimulus (as compared to when it was used on the\nside of fixation opposite to the visual stimulus). In a complemen-\ntary manner, clusters of voxels in occipital cortex ipsilateral to the\nvisual stimuli showed decreased BOLD responses when the tool tip\nwas used next to it, as compared to when used on the contralateral\nside. Several clusters, in particular in the right hemisphere lingual\ngyrus, shoed both increased and decreased responses as a function\nof tool position.\nWe also identified regions in which the BOLD response\ncovaried significantly with performance on the behavioural\nmultisensory discrimination task. This analysis revealed a number\nof areas in the medial and lateral superior frontal gyrus, occipital\nFigure 4. Z-statistic distributions for the main effects, simple\neffects, and interactions.

Specifically, BOLD response in these\nareas increased or decreased in linear proportion to the magnitude\nof multisensory interactions across participants. The response in\nthese areas may reflect several multisensory processes, including\nthe integration of visual and vibrotactile stimuli at the single cell or\npopulation level, the detection and resolution of multisensory\nresponse conflicts, the generation of responses based upon these\nconflicting multisensory cues, and any differences in error-related\nprocessing across participants.\nFinally, we repeated our original analyses in order to examine\nwhich of the three experimental variables (visual distractor\nposition, tool tip position, and hand used), or their interactions,\nmost likely contributed to the generation of the significant\nmultisensory integration effects. These final analyses revealed that\nthe position of the visual distractor relative to the visual midline\nwas clearly the most relevant factor for influencing the BOLD\nresponse specifically in those brain regions whose response was\nmost tightly coupled with the between-participant behavioural\nvariation in multisensory integration.\nNew findings\nWe instructed the healthy participants in our experiments\nexplicitly to ignore the visual distractors, and to pay attention only,\nand to respond only, to the type of vibrotactile target presented at\nthe tip of the tool, and felt by the hand holding the tool. The\noptimal strategy for correct task performance might therefore have\nbeen to close one’s eyes and to pay attention to the vibrotactile\nstimuli perceived by the hand holding the tool. However, we\ninstructed participants to keep their eyes open and fixated on a\ncentral visual stimulus, monitoring the fixation cross for brief,\nsubtle, and unpredictable changes in luminance, and withholding\nthe subsequent motor response when this occurred.\nThe participants performed the fixation task with .80% success\n(chance performance would have been ,8%, see Figure S3), and\nshowed both significant behavioural effects of multisensory\ncongruency, and BOLD response differences as a function of the\nrelative location of the visual distractors with respect to the\nfunctional tip of the tool. These results occurred despite our\ninstructions to the participants to ignore the visual distractors and\nto respond only to the vibrotactile targets. In summary, this new\nfinding allows us to conclude that using a tool to perceive\nvibrotactile stimuli has, as one consequence, a shift in participants’\nspatial attention to the location where the functional part of the\ntool is held and used, and a subsequent increased BOLD response\nfor visual distractors presented at that location, and a comple-\nmentary decreased BOLD response for visual distractors presented\nin the ipsilateral visual field.\nThese findings using fMRI complement our recent purely\nbehavioural findings reported elsewhere [7–9]. In these studies, we\nshowed that holding and repeatedly using a variety of tools results\nin the preferential processing of visual distractors primarily near\nthe functional parts (typically the distal tips) of the actively used\ntools. Until the present fMRI data were collected, it was difficult to\ndiscern, a priori , whether such behavioural results were due\npredominantly to shifts in visuospatial or multisensory attention to\nthe position where the functional part of the tool were held, or\ndue, at least in part, to activation of hand-centred or tool-centred\nmultisensory representations, for example in posterior parietal or\npremotor cortices [10,44,45]. The fMRI data presented here\nclearly support the former possibility – that the reported\nbehavioural effects of tool use may be due predominantly to\nrelatively low-level attentional effects of the position of a tool on\nthe processing of incoming sensory stimuli in occipital cortex.\nThe second major new finding in the present report is that the\nmultisensory interactions observed in a previously well-studied\nbehavioural congruency task [9,18–20] are strongly and signifi-\ncantly related, across participants, to neural processing in the right\nmedial and superior frontal cortex, the midline and lateral\ncerebellum, and bilateral occipital cortex. Different nodes in this\nnetwork are very likely to be involved in the detection and\nresolution of the multisensory response conflicts, in response\nselection, and in error-related processing that arises in such\ncongruency tasks (e.g., particularly in the medial frontal cortex\n[35]). However, the BOLD responses in other regions within this\nnetwork, particularly the lateral occipital cortex, were also shown\nto depend significantly on the location of the visual distractor\nstimuli. We take this as evidence that visual or multisensory\nprocessing in these areas is tightly linked to the generation of the\nbehavioural effects of multisensory congruency between the visual\nand vibrotactile stimuli.\nFigure 5. Main effects of visual distractor position within\nclusters defined by the multisensory contrasts.Activity signifi-\ncantly correlated with multisensory integration (either RT or % error\nmeasures), which also showed a significantly higher response for\ncontralateral versus ipsilateral visual distractors. Red clusters show left\nhemisphere occipital regions showing both higher activation for right\nthan for left visual distractors, and a significant covariation of BOLD\nsignal change with the behavioural measures of multisensory\nintegration. Blue clusters show similar regions in the right occipital\ncortex with a preference for left over right visual stimulation, and a\nsignificant covariation of BOLD with the behavioural measures of\nmultisensory integration. Voxels were thresholded at p#.05, voxelwise\nBonferroni-corrected across the volume defined by the 19,220 voxels\nshowing a significant covariation with the behavioural measures of\nmultisensory integration.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0003502.g005\nSpatial Attention and Tool Use\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 9 October 2008 | Volume 3 | Issue 10 | e3502\nPossible criticisms of the present study\nA number of possible methodological and theoretical criticisms\nof the present work need to be addressed explicitly. These\ncriticisms have been raised by various reviewers and commenta-\ntors on our work in the past, and, although we have dealt with\nsimilar criticisms elsewhere [7–9], we provide a brief discussion of\nthese issues here.\nWhat is tool use?. This simple-sounding question is in fact\nextraordinarily difficult to answer. The interpretation of the\npresent results and their relevance to other studies of ‘tool use’\nclearly requires an answer to this question. Benjamin Beck is a\nrenowned authority on the use of tools in the non-human animal\nkingdom, and in his 1980 book [46] on the topic he concluded:\n‘‘After 15 years of trying [to provide a definition of tool use], I’m\nunhappy to report that I have not been totally successful.’’ [46, p.\n4]. We concur with the thoughtful conclusions and the caveats\nraised by Beck, and believe that attempts to define tool use simply,\nnon-arbitrarily, and non-circularly are fraught with difficulties.\nOne option could be, for example, to resort to a dictionary\ndefinition, with the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) offering:\n‘‘any instrument of manual operation’’, where instrument is\ndefined as an ’’object used for a given purpose’’. But this definition\nseems, to us at least, somewhat vague to be useful in a scientific\ncontext. A computer keyboard, for example, is a manually-\noperated object used for the purpose of data entry, but the sensory-\nmotor interactions required in the prototypical use of a keyboard\nare rather different from those required to use a screwdriver, a\nrake, a pointer, or the canes used to navigate by the blind.\nAccording to the OED definition, the participants in our study\nwere clearly manually operating an instrument for a specific\npurpose – without holding, correctly orienting, exerting\ndownwards pressure, and moving the stick at the correct times,\nthe participants in our task could not have performed correctly.\nFrom the fact that they did indeed perform the tasks well above\nchance, we can conclude that tool use was occurring during the\nfMRI sessions.\nAs compared to dictionary definitions, in the academic\ncommunity studying the effects of a variety of tool use tasks on\nsensory-motor and multisensory interactions, tool use has rarely\nbeen defined explicitly. We have recently provided [47] one\npossible definition, extrapolating from Beck’s definition in order to\napply it both to humans in general, and to the scientific literature\non tool use and peripersonal space in particular. In that definition,\nwe aimed to draw a line (albeit an arbitrary one) between a\nnumber of tasks that either did or did not constitute tool use. Such\na definition can of course never be the final word, particularly\ngiven the rate at which technology develops, especially that of tele-\nsurgical and brain-computer interface devices. We believe,\nhowever, that our definition of tool use is both sufficiently liberal\nand sufficiently conservative to allow clear hypothesis-driven\nquestions concerning multisensory attention (and multisensory\nperipersonal space) to be answered in a pragmatic way.\nFurthermore, we are extremely wary of the possibility that one\nmight choose to define tools rather flexibly, on the basis of the\nresults of particular studies of tool use – i.e., whether the results are\nconsistent or inconsistent with one’s beliefs about the effects of tool\nuse on, for example, representations of peripersonal space or on\nmultisensory attentional processes [48]. Since the key researchers\nworking in the scientific field addressed by the present study must\ncertainly agree that the task we used clearly constituted tool use\n(e.g., compare the wide variety of tool use tasks reported by such\nresearchers [3–17]), we feel that this question over definitions is\ntangential to the relevance and importance of the present findings.\nIn any case, if one were to decide that our task was not really ‘tool\nuse’, we have still succeeded in showing that the position, relative\nto visual distractors, of the functional part of a manually-held\nobject used to perceive distant vibrotactile stimuli significantly\nmodulates the BOLD response in the occipital cortices, and that\nthese modulations are most likely due to spatial shifts of attention\ntowards the functional tip of that object. We see no reason why\nother, genuine, or more complex, forms of tool use would not also\ninvolve such shifts of attention to the functional part of the tool.\nThis possibility, however, needs to be assessed in future research.\nFinally, concerning definitions of tool use, we note the recent\npaper by St. Amant & Horton [49]. In their detailed theoretical\ndiscussion of how to define tool use in the animal and human\nbehavioural literature, St. Amant & Horton also revised Beck’s\nnow classic definition of tool use to include those instances of tool\nuse which ‘‘mediate the flow of information’’ between the tool user\nand the environment, including both direct physical interactions\nwith objects, and communicative gestures. This ‘mediation of\ninformation flow’ through direct physical interactions with objects\nfits very well with the working definition of tool use that we\nproposed [47].\nVisual attention at the tip of the tool, or a non-linear\nsupra-additive interaction between multiple visual\nstimuli?. One of the reviewers of this manuscript pointed out\nthat the increased BOLD responses in (contralateral) occipital\ncortex when the tool was held and used next to the visual stimulus\ncould be due either, as we suggested, to the effects of spatial\nattention to the tip of the tool (and thus to the visual distractor\npresented at the same location), or else to an interaction between\ntwo separate visual stimuli (the visual distractor and the tip of the\ntool respectively), arising, simply and trivially, from the presence of\nmore visual stimulation in that portion of the visual field. The\ninteraction between the two visual stimuli could arise in one or\nboth of two ways:\n1) If the BOLD response in occipital cortex summed up\nseparate, independent visual inputs in a non-linear and supra-\nadditive fashion (the effects would have to be supra-additive\nbecause: a) The tip of the tool was present in the visual field for 12\nor 36 s before the visual distractors were illuminated, likely giving\nsufficient time for the BOLD response to habituate to any simple\nvisual effect of the tip of the tool alone, and; b) The critical\ncontrasts were performed between conditions with identical visual\ndistractors on the same side of space);\n2) If the visual distractor stimulus increased the illumination of\nthe tip of the tool relative to its background, thus increasing the\noverall illumination present in that portion of space. We can make\nfour arguments against these possibilities.\nFirst, regarding non-linear summation. Probably due to the\nhabituation and saturation of the BOLD response, the large size of\nfunctional imaging voxels, and the presence of heterogeneous cell\npopulations within a given voxel, studies of multisensory interactions\nin neuroimaging very rarely find any evidence for supra-additive\nsummation, despite numerous clear examples of multisensory\nsupra-additivity in single and multi-unit recordings, local field\npotentials, and in behavioural multisensory interactions [27,33].\nMore commonly, additive or sub-additive effects are found in the\nBOLD response to independent stimuli, even when those stimuli\nare congruent with each other and presented close to each other in\nspace and time. Similarly, and more directly relevant to the\npresent concern, in one detailed and intensive study of the\nsummation of responses to separate visual stimuli within a portion\nof retinotopic primary visual cortex, the BOLD response was\nfound to sum linearly in two human subjects [50]. Given these\nfindings, and assuming that no simple or physical visual interaction\neffects occurred (see the next paragraph), the possibility of non-\nSpatial Attention and Tool Use\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 10 October 2008 | Volume 3 | Issue 10 | e3502\nlinear and supra-additive spatial summation of separate visual\ninputs can be disregarded.\nSecond, it is possible that the visual distractors illuminated the\ntip of the tool, and that this increased illumination on the same\nside as the visual distractor resulted in additional BOLD response\nin contralateral occipital cortex. Note that such an explanation\nwould not require any non-linear or supra-additive summation of\nBOLD responses, so is independent from the first possibility\ndiscussed above. Our experiments were performed in a dimly-lit\nscanner room. We did not make any measurement of the total\nillumination present at different positions in the visual field during\nthe eight experimental conditions studied. We can only note here\nthat the visual distractor stimuli were positioned at the rear of an\nunpainted aluminium box, mounted on a transparent acrylic table\nover the participant’s legs. Both of these pieces of apparatus would\nhave reflected some of the light of the distractor into the scanner\nbore. During the experimental set-up, we asked participants whilst\ninside the scanner bore to inform us if the visual distractor stimuli\nwere being reflected off either surface, and if they were, we\nadjusted the distractor positions to remove these secondary visual\ninputs. By contrast with the smooth, reflective surfaces of the\naluminium box and the acrylic table, the tip of the tool was\nwooden, rough, and less reflective. Thus, it is unlikely that any\nsimple visual effects of reflection or illumination could explain the\nmodulations of BOLD response in occipital cortex, since the less-\nreflective surface of the distal tip of the tool was occluding the more-\nreflective surfaces of the aluminium and acrylic apparatus when\nthe tip of the tool was on the same side as the distractor.\nA third point to note is that we observed both contralateral\nincreases in BOLD response as a function of tool position (i.e., a tool\nused on the left side increased the BOLD response in right occipital\ncortex to left visual distractors as compared with when the tool was\nused on the right), and ipsilateral decreases in activation (i.e., a tool\nused on the left side decreased the BOLD response in left occipital\ncortex to left visual distractors as compared with when the tool was\nused on the right side). In order to explain our findings, any simple\neffects of two visual stimuli would therefore have to show both\nnon-linear supra-additive positive BOLD in contralateral occipital\ncortex, and non-linear supra-additive negative BOLD in ipsilateral\noccipital cortex. This double and hemispherically-symmetrical\nnon-linearity in the BOLD response is thus doubly unlikely as an\nexplanation for our reported effects. Furthermore, in the presence\nof an attentionally-demanding RSVP task performed at central\nfixation, the BOLD responses elicited by large, high-contrast\nperipheral visual distractors in areas V1 to V4 in one hemisphere\nwere unaffected by the presence of ipsilateral visual distractors,\nsuggesting that ‘surround suppression’ does not operate inter-\nhemispherically [22]. This implies that the deactivations that we\nobserved cannot be due to the mere presence of visual stimulation\nin the ipsilateral hemispace, but rather require an attentional\nexplanation [21].\nFourth and finally, as detailed in the Results section, the regions\nof cortex in which the BOLD response was modulated significantly\nas a function of tool tip position, concur well with those activated\nin previous studies of visual or multisensory spatial attention,\nwhich is known to operate in a ‘push-pull’ manner, with both\nincreases and decreases of attention-related activation in extra-\nstriate cortex [21].\nTo conclude, we note that additional experiments in which\nparticipants performed both a passive and an active tool use task,\nunder similar experimental conditions as reported here would be\nrequired in order definitively and finally to rule out the possibility\nof bilateral non-linear supra-additive spatial interactions due\nsimply to the visual presence of the tip of the tool. However,\ngiven: 1) The generally linear summation of BOLD responses; 2)\nThe fact that the tip of the tool was not highly visible and was in\nfact less reflective than the background; 3) The presence of both\ncontralateral increases and ipsilateral decreases in BOLD response\nas a function of tool position, and; 4) The locations of the reported\nBOLD modulations relative to other studies of spatial attention,\nwe believe that the attentional explanation is the more\nparsimonious one, since spatial attention has repeatedly been\nshown to lead to both increases in BOLD response for stimuli\npresented at the attended, and decreases in BOLD response for\nstimuli presented at unattended locations.\nAbsence of significant hand-centred or tool-centred\nmultisensory interactions or BOLD responses. The\nabsence of evidence for a particular process can never, of\ncourse, be taken as evidence of the absence of that process. We\ndid not find significant clusters of activation, or any strong\nindications that hand-centred multisensory processes were\noperating during our tool use task, under the conditions we\nstudied, despite the presence of strong visual-vibrotactile\nbehavioural interactions, and the indications from previous\nstudies that such interactions may be hand- or tool-specific\n[9,10,12]. This is surprising if one believes that multisensory\ninteractions during tool use occur in hand-centred reference\nframes, and that such interactions occur in or result from\nprocessing in parietal and or premotor cortices [10]. We do not\nhold this belief. Rather, we believe that many, if not all, of the\nreported effects of tool use on multisensory integration may in fact\nbe due predominantly to eye-centred mechanisms of multisensory\nspatial attention, and that the locus of these effects may be in\nrelatively ‘low-level’ or ‘early’ sensory (visual) cortices. We believe\nthat the present data, our previous behavioural results, and many\nof the published results on the multisensory consequences of tool\nuse from other laboratories, are most clearly and parsimoniously\naccounted for by such eye-centred effects of multisensory spatial\nattention, rather than by, for example, hand-centred mechanisms\nof peripersonal space. However, since the majority of studies in\nthis field have not been able experimentally to distinguish between\nthese alternative hypotheses, future studies are clearly required in\norder to resolve any apparent contradictions that remain in the\nliterature.\nSeveral other factors may account for the absence of hand-\ncentred effects in the present dataset. First, the design of our study,\nor the fMRI protocol we used, may have been insufficiently\npowerful or sensitive to detect the very subtle, sparsely-distributed,\nor spatially very limited effects that have been proposed to\ngenerate the significant and apparently hand-centred multisensory\ninteractions reported elsewhere. This possibility can only be\nconfirmed with positive evidence showing that such processes do\nindeed exist and are measurable, while also providing evidence to\nrule out alternative possibilities such as the attentional hypothesis\ndiscussed here. Such evidence is not yet available, and we must\ntherefore await future studies. If such effects do exist, yet are very\nweak or subtle, it raises the questions as to whether they can\nindeed explain all of the many reported multisensory consequences\nof tool use behaviours, and why the more powerful and more\neasily-detected effects of spatial attention are behaviourally and\nneurally less important or effective in this regard.\nSecond, it may be possible that the visual stimuli we used (static,\nflashing LEDs) are simply not able to activate the regions of\nparietal and premotor cortex that are thought to be involved in\nmediating sensory processing during or following tool use. This is\nan important possibility, which needs to be tested in future\nresearch. For now, we simply highlight the fact that, in the\nneuropsychological literature on the effects of tool use on cross-\nSpatial Attention and Tool Use\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 11 October 2008 | Volume 3 | Issue 10 | e3502\nmodal extinction, static flashing LEDs and three-dimensional\nrapid movements of an experimenter’s finger have been shown, in\none study, to result in comparable levels of visual-tactile\ninteractions [14]. The possible implications from this study are\neither: a) That the stimuli used (both the rapidly moving fingers\nand flashing LEDs) were also insufficient to activate parietal and\npremotor cortex (since static LEDs and moving fingers produced\ncomparable results) and that the reported effects must therefore\nhave depended upon mechanisms of spatial attention and\nmodulation of activity in occipital cortex, or; b) That LEDs are\nindeed sufficient to activate parietal and premotor cortex in an\nequivalent manner to rapidly moving fingers. The results of our\nstudy support the former, attentional interpretation.\nFinally, it is possible that the specific kinds of tool used, or the\nspecific tool use task performed, have a direct bearing on the kinds\nof multisensory interactions that occur, and the neural processes\nthat are involved. This is almost certainly true in some respects, for\nexample, relating to the well-known differences in the neural\ncontrol of precision vs. power grasping movements, or between the\nreaching/transport and grasping/hand-shaping components of\ntarget-directed movements, which undoubtedly will differ between\ndifferent tools. However, we only wish to note here that, with\nregard to the published evidence concerning the effects of a variety\nof tool use tasks on sensory-motor and multisensory processes,\nMaravita and Iriki [10] concluded:\n‘‘Intriguingly, whilst in some studies on humans the reported\nbehavioural effects of tool-use occurred without any specific\ntraining … in other studies substantial tool-use training was\nrequired to elicit these effects … It might be that simple acts,\nlike pointing or reaching with a stick will show behavioural\neffects without training, whereas more complex tasks\ninvolving dexterous use of a tool, such as retrieving objects\nwith a rake require some training before any behavioural\neffects will emerge.’’ [10, p. 84].\nWe agree in general with these sentiments, however we remain\ncautious about the possibility that successful tool use is being defined\nhere based upon the results (the ‘behavioural effects’) observed in\nthe reported experimental settings, rather than upon the tool used\nand/or the tool use task being performed. The question therefore\narises: Given a particular or novel tool use task, such as the one used\nin the present report, for how long should one continue the tool use\ntraining in order to test the hypothesis, for example, that tool use\nchanges multisensory processing? If the answer is either: a) ‘Until\nmultisensory processing changes’ or; b) ‘Until the well-known,\nprototypical effects of tool use emerge’, then it seems, at least to us,\nthat such a hypothesis would be impossible to refute.\nConclusions\nOur results have clear and important implications for how\nmultisensory stimuli are processed during and following the use of\nsimple hand-held objects as tools. The present results suggest that\ntool use is associated with an automatic shift of spatial attention to\nthe location where the functional part of the tool is used. The\nposition of the functional part of the tool relative to visual\ndistractor stimuli modulated the BOLD response, both positively\nand negatively, in portions of visual cortex likely comprising\nretinotopic areas V1–V4 and VP, and most prominently in the\nright hemisphere lingual gyrus, which also showed a significant\nbetween-participants covariation between the BOLD response and\nthe behavioural measures of multisensory integration. This spatial\nattentional shift occurred despite the fact that participants were\nspecifically instructed to ignore the visual distractor stimuli, and to\nattend to and respond only according to the vibrotactile stimuli.\nThe consequence of this shift of spatial attention was that activity\nin occipital cortex was modulated in a manner consistent with\nprevious studies of the voluntary orienting of spatial attention,\nenhancing activity contralateral, and suppressing activity ipsilat-\neral to the visual distractors. This modulation of activity in\nretinotopic portions of occipital cortex may represent the early\nselection of relevant and suppression of irrelevant visual stimuli for\nthe control of tool use actions.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nTwenty-one participants were recruited and paid twenty pounds\n(UK Sterling) per scan for their participation. All reported being\nright-handed, having normal or corrected vision, normal tactile\nsensation, and no neurological or psychiatric abnormalities.\nFourteen participated in Experiment 1 (right-hand tool use, 5\nfemale, aged 21–36 years, mean 6s.e.m. = 24.961.1 years,\nmean6s.e.m. handedness laterality quotient (LQ) = 76.4 66.9,\n[51]), and thirteen participated in Experiment 2 (left-hand tool\nuse, 5 female, aged 20–30 years, mean 6s.e.m. = 25.860.8 years,\nmean6s.e.m. LQ = 70.6 67.0, including six participants from\nExperiment 1). All experimental procedures were approved by the\nlocal National Health Service ethics board and were conducted in\naccordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants gave\ninformed written consent to participate and were screened for\nMRI-safety criteria before being scanned. Behavioural data from\none participant in Experiment 1 were lost due to human error.\nApparatus & materials\nPiezoelectric vibrotactile stimulators. Two custom-built\nMR-compatible piezoelectric-ceramic vibrotactile stimulators\ndriven by a custom-built waveform generator were used to\ndeliver vibrotactile stimuli. Each consisted of an aluminium box\n(5.562.268.0 cm) containing a 2 cm piezoelectric-ceramic\nelement, vertically displacing a plastic rod ,1 mm. The\nvibrating surface of the stimulus was 19.6 mm\n2. Stimuli were\npresented at ,200 Hz [52–53]. A small rubber semi-circular\n‘guide’ was positioned on top of the vibrotactile stimulus to\nfacilitate tool positioning during the experiment.\nAdditional apparatus. The vibrotactile stimulator boxes\nwere attached by Velcro TM, 15 cm either side of the middle of\nan acrylic table (15 675645 cm). One red LED (8 mm diameter,\n660 nm, 550 mcd, 60 u viewing angle) was positioned 1 cm above\nthe vibrotactile stimulator on each side. The tool was a cylindrical\nwooden dowel (8 mm diameter 6750 mm length). A rear-\nprojection screen was positioned over the legs of the\nparticipants, ,1.5 m from their eyes (Figure 1E). Responses\nwere collected with a MRI-compatible button box, held by the\nparticipant in the hand opposite to the one holding the tool. The\nstimuli were controlled and the responses were collected using\nPresentation software (Neurobehavioural Systems Inc., Albany,\nUSA). The experimental apparatus caused no detectable artefacts\nin the fMRI data.\nDesign\nEach participant performed two experimental runs per hand\ntested. Each run consisted of 16 624 s ‘task’ blocks, interleaved\nwith 16618 s ‘rest’ blocks. Each run lasted 681 s, including an\ninitial 9 s for scanner equilibration. Each block consisted of one of\nfour visual-vibrotactile conditions, resulting from the factorial\ncombination of the two condition variables: 1) Tool tip and\nSpatial Attention and Tool Use\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 12 October 2008 | Volume 3 | Issue 10 | e3502\nvibrotactile target position (TL: left, TR: right), and; 2) Visual\ndistractor position (VL: left, VR: right). The four conditions were\nas follows: 1) TLVL; 2) TLVR; 3) TRVL; 4) TRVR (Figure 1).\nThey were run in separate blocks of trials, in ascending order (1-2-\n3-4-1-2…) in one run and in descending order (4-3-2-1-4-3…) in\nthe second run, with the sequence of four blocks repeated four\ntimes per run. This fixed block order was used to keep the number\nand timing of tool movements constant within and between\nparticipants. The four possible starting conditions and two possible\nstarting sequence orders were fully counterbalanced across\nparticipants. In post-hoc analyses, peak voxels within significant\nclusters of activation, in which the BOLD response showed\nsignificant main effects of block order, or interactions between\nblock order and the experimental conditions of interest, were\nidentified, and are not discussed here due to possible artefactual or\ntheoretically uninteresting effects. Each block contained four trial\ntypes, resulting from the factorial combination of the two trial\nvariables: 1) Vibrotactile target stimulus type (continuous vs.\npulsed stimuli), and; 2) Visual distractor stimulus type (continuous\nvs. pulsed). Continuous stimuli were 200 ms in duration. Pulsed\nstimuli were also 200 ms in duration, but contained a 70 ms gap\nwith no stimulus in the middle (i.e., 65 ms ON, 70 ms OFF, 65 ms\nON). Each of the four trial types was presented three times per\nblock of trials, in a pseudorandomised order, with one multisen-\nsory stimulus presented every 2 s. Within each block, one\nadditional trial (a ‘fixation’ trial, see below) was pseudorandomly\ninterleaved within the sequence of twelve trials.\nThe right hand tool use experiment was run first. The left hand\ntool use experiment was run several weeks or months later.\nParticipants were either tested on both experiments, or matched\nfor age, sex, and handedness score between experiments (between-\nexperiments t-tests, t(12) ,1, ns). We had no a priori hypotheses\nconcerning differences between the effects of using left and right\nhands, and assumed equal variances for the two conditions,\nallowing us to perform paired analyses.\nProcedure\nThe participants lay supine in the scanner, viewing the\nexperimental apparatus and screen through a mirror mounted on\nthe head coil (Figure 1E). The participants’ arms, head, and legs,\nand the stimulus table were supported with soft padding in order to\nminimise movement and the spread of vibration. The visual and\nvibrotactile stimulators were adjusted, immediately prior to the\nscan, to lie at the distal tip of the tool held in the participants’ hand,\nand were positioned in order to minimize shoulder, arm, and hand\nmovements during the experiment. The distance of the stimuli from\nthe participants’ eyes therefore depended on the length of their\narms. The maximum difference in distances between the left and\nright stimuli and the participants’ eyes was,6 cm: The left stimuli\nwere closer to the participant for right hand tool use, and the right\nstimuli were closer for left hand tool use. These differences were\nnevertheless constant across the four experimental conditions, and\nthe crucial comparisons of interest (the effect of tool side within the\ncluster defined by the main effect of visual distractor side) were\nperformed separately for left and right visual distractor positions,\nthus fully balancing any simple effects of visual distractor distance or\nother possible, but irrelevant, differences between left and right\nvisual distractors (e.g., visual angular size or luminance).\nTask blocks. In the task blocks, participants performed a\nvibrotactile discrimination task and a visual fixation-monitoring\ntask concurrently.\nVibrotactile discrimination task. The participants were\ninstructed to hold the distal tip of the tool in contact with the active\nvibrotactile stimulator on one side (left or right) throughout a block\nof trials, while maintaining fixation on a white cross (3 63 cm)\npresented centrally at the bottom of the rear-projection screen.\nParticipants were instructed to respond as quickly and as\naccurately as possible to the vibrotactile target stimuli by\npressing one of the two buttons: The left button for continuous,\nand the right button for pulsed stimuli, while maintaining central\nfixation and trying to ignore the visual distractor stimuli. The\nvisual distractor stimuli were irrelevant to the task and were non-\npredictive of the vibrotactile target type.\nFixation-monitoring task. The visual fixation cross dimmed\nfor 250 ms, from white (100% screen brightness) to grey (70%)\nonce during each task block. Following a fixation dimming event,\nthe participants were required to withhold their response on the\nsubsequent trial in the current block.\nRest blocks. At the beginning of each rest block, the fixation\ncross was replaced by a white chevron ( , or .) indicating the\nposition (left or right, respectively) of the active vibrotactile target\nstimulator for the next task block. For half of the blocks, this\nrequired no change of the position of the tip of the tool, and for the\nother half, the participants were required to move the tip of the\ntool to the side indicated by the chevron as quickly as possible,\nwhile making the minimum of body movements (i.e., by moving\nonly their wrist and fingers). After 5 s, the chevron was replaced\nwith the fixation cross, which remained in place for a further 11 s,\nwas extinguished for 500 ms, then re-illuminated for the last\n1500 ms of the rest block as a cue for the participant to prepare for\nthe impending task block. The participants were instructed to\nremain as still as possible, and to maintain visual fixation on the\nfixation cross throughout the rest block. It is very important to\nnote here that the tool tip was in position and remained static for\nat least 12 s (and for half of the blocks, 36 s) before each and every\nblock of experimental trials. This ensured that any changes in\nBOLD activity recorded in the task blocks relative to the baseline\n‘rest’ blocks could not simply be due to the position of the tool or\nto the tip of the tool acting as an additional ‘visual’ stimulus (see\nalso the Discussion). Task-related changes in BOLD response\ncould therefore only be due to the main effects of visual distractor\nposition, vibrotactile target/tool use location, the interaction\nbetween these variables, or to a main effect of task performance,\nwhich is of little theoretical interest and not reported here.\nOne or two days before the scanning session, participants trained\non the tool use and fixation monitoring tasks for 10–20 minutes in a\nsimulated scanner environment, lying supine, holding the same tool\nand discriminating the same target vibrations from the same\napparatus. Recorded scanner noise was played in the background or\nover headphones. Such periods of training on tool use tasks has\noften been argued to result in significant changes in multisensory\nintegration in peripersonal space [10].\nMagnetic resonance imaging\nImages were acquired on a Siemens Sonata 1.5T magnet.\nEchoplanar (EPI) T2*-weighted functional images were acquired\nwith the following parameters: Repetition time (TR) = 3 s, echo\ntime (TE) = 50 ms, voxel size = 36363 mm, 35 contiguous axial\nslices acquired dorsally to ventrally, matrix size = 64 664. Func-\ntional data acquisition and the behavioural task began 9 s (three\nTRs) after the onset of the run. 224 whole-brain volumes were\nacquired per run. High resolution, T1-weighted structural images\nwere acquired with the following parameters: TR = 12 ms,\nTE = 4.76 ms, voxel size = 16161 mm.\nAnalysis\nPre-processing. All fMRI analyses were performed with\nFEAT (fMRI Expert Analysis Tool) Versions 5.63 or later, part of\nSpatial Attention and Tool Use\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 13 October 2008 | Volume 3 | Issue 10 | e3502\nFSL (FMRIB’s Software Library, http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl).\nThe following analysis was applied to each functional run; Slice-\ntiming correction using Fourier-space time-series phase-shifting;\nMotion correction using MCFLIRT [54]; Non-brain removal\nusing BET [55]; 3D spatial smoothing using an isotropic Gaussian\nkernel of 8 mm full width at half maximum (FWHM); Global\n(volumetric) multiplicative mean intensity renormalization; High-\npass temporal filtering (Gaussian-weighted LSF straight line fitting,\nwith sigma = 54 s, corresponding to a low-pass cut-off of 1/\n108 Hz). Time-series statistical analysis was carried out using\nFILM with local autocorrelation correction [56]. Registration of\neach participant’s functional T2*-weighted to high resolution T1-\nweighted scans and subsequently to the MNI52 standard brain\ntemplate was carried out using FLIRT, with 7, and 12 degree-of-\nfreedom linear transforms, respectively [54,57].\nWithin-participant analysis. The two time-series of\nfunctional data for each participant were modelled with a\nboxcar block design (24 s ON, 18 s OFF) convolved with a\ncanonical (double-gamma) haemodynamic response function, and\ndelayed by 6 s. Four regressors of interest corresponding to the\nfour conditions (TLVL, TLVR, TRVL, & TRVR), and seven\nregressors of no interest (the temporal derivatives of the four main\nregressors, plus leftward tool movements, rightward tool\nmovements, and fixation dimming events) were included in the\nmodel for each functional run. The two sets of contrast images\nobtained from each run for each participant were submitted to a\nhigher analysis using a fixed effects model, by forcing the random\neffects variance to zero in FLAME [58–59]. The results of this\nwithin-participant analysis were passed-up to a higher-level\nbetween-participants (group) analysis.\nBetween-participants analysis. The final group analysis\nwas carried out using mixed effects (in which participant was a\nrandom effect) FLAME, in MNI152 template space, with final\nvoxel dimensions of 26262 mm. Statistically significant responses\nwere determined by applying an initial Z-value (i.e., Gaussianised-\nt) cut-off as a cluster creation threshold, and assessing the size of\ncontiguous clusters of voxels against Gaussian random field theory,\ncorrecting for multiple comparisons across the search volume to\np#.05, corrected. Several analyses also used Bonferroni\ncorrections for multiple comparisons, as detailed in the Results\nsection. Three different analyses were performed to assess visual,\ntool-dependent, and multisensory effects of interest.\nIn the first analysis, data from all eight experimental conditions\n(i.e., the four main conditions, for both the left and the right hand\ntool use experiments) were entered into a 3-way analysis of variance\n(ANOVA) with the variables hand (left, right), tool side (left, right),\nand visual distractor side (left, right). Weighted contrasts for all\neffects of interest were assessed with an initial Z-value threshold of\nZ = 2.33, p#.01, and whole brain cluster corrected to p #.05. The\nfollowing contrasts were performed (Figure 1B–D): 1) The simple\neffects of visual distractor position were tested with two contrasts,\none for the left [(TLVL +TRVL).(TLVR+TRVR)], and one for\nthe right visual distractors [(TLVR +TRVR).(TLVL+TRVL)]\n(Figure 1B); 2) The effects of tool position were tested with two\ncontrasts, restricted to the regions within the clusters defined by the\nsimple effects of visual distractor position: [TLVL .TRVL], and\n[TRVR.TLVR]. The simple main effects of tool position\n(Figure 1C) were also tested; 3) Finally, the presence of hand-\ncentred or tool tip-centred activations was assessed with the\ninteraction between visual distractor position and tool tip position\n(Figure 1D). This was performed both separately for each\nexperiment (i.e., for each hand used), collapsing across the two\nexperiments, and with experiment as an additional variable in a\nthree-way analysis.\nIn the second analysis, the mean of each of the eight\nexperimental conditions was modelled out as a regressor of no\ninterest, and two sets of eight behavioural measures (crossmodal\ncongruency effect derived from RTs and percentage errors, with\nthe across-participant mean subtracted per condition) were\nentered as predictors in separate analyses. Areas with BOLD\nresponses that covaried significantly (either positively or negatively)\nwith the behavioural measures of multisensory integration, were\nassessed across the whole brain, separately for RT and error score\npredictors.\nIn a third analysis, the first set of analyses (i.e., the contrasts\ninvolving the experimental variables of visual distractor position,\ntool position, and hand used) were repeated, but restricting the\nsearch volume to those regions in which the BOLD response\nvaried significantly as a function of the behavioural measures of\nmultisensory integration (i.e., the inclusive sum of significant\nclusters with either positive and negative covariation between\nBOLD response and RT or error measures of multisensory\nintegration).\nFor all analyses, significant activation peaks of interest in the\ngroup statistical maps were interrogated using FEATQUERY: A\nmask was created manually in MNI template standard space,\nincorporating several voxels surrounding the peak voxel in order\nto create a mask, typically of 5–20 voxels (0.14–0.54 cm\n3)i n\nvolume after transformation back to each participant’s native\nspace. The number of voxels in the mask was determined by\ndecreasing the Z-statistic threshold of the group activation map\nuntil at least five contiguous voxels around the peak were above\nthreshold (this process was performed solely to ensure that\nsufficient voxels remained after transformation of the mask from\nMNI template standard space sampled at 2 6262 mm, to the\nparticipants’ native space sampled at 3 6363 mm). The percent-\nage signal change was averaged over those voxels for each of the\neight experimental conditions separately, and further analysed\nwith four-way repeated measures ANOVA (including the\nadditional variable, task sequence order) in order simply to\nconfirm the directions of particular effects following the whole-\nbrain analyses. Since these analyses of signal change were biased\nby the prior selection of peak voxels in a given contrast, these\nexploratory signal change analyses were used predominantly: a)\nTo exclude groups of voxels from subsequent interpretation which\nshowed artefactual effects (for example, those peak voxels lying\nnear the edges of the brain or ventricles); b) To exclude groups of\nvoxels from subsequent interpretation which showed any signif-\nicant effects or interactions with the order in which the tasks were\nperformed (p#.01), and; c) To assess whether significant contrasts\nresulted from activations, deactivations, or both directions of\nmodulation relative to the baseline. Data from peak voxels in\nwhich artefactual effects of, or interactions with, block order were\nnot included or discussed in the analysis or report. This process\nwas performed after the main statistical analyses reported in the\ntext. No other significant clusters were observed.\nTwo additional post-hoc analyses were performed based on the\nraw timeseries data of a cluster of ‘seed’ voxels in the right\nhemisphere lingual gyrus, centred on the MNI coordinate (20,\n268, 22). The first analysis assessed the ‘functional connectivity’\nbetween signal in this area and other brain areas by searching for\nvoxels whose signal covaried with signal in the seed voxels. The\nsecond analysis assessed the ‘effective connectivity’ as a function of\nthe task versus rest: The raw timeseries data were multiplied by +1\nfor signal reflecting task periods (i.e., delayed by 6 s), and 21 for\nsignal related to rest periods. In each case, the demeaned\ntimeseries was entered as a regressor in a first-level analysis\nwithout temporal filtering, convolution with the double-gamma\nSpatial Attention and Tool Use\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 14 October 2008 | Volume 3 | Issue 10 | e3502\nHRF, or including temporal derivative regressors.
