    "abstract": "This letter evaluates the article by Gravina et al on ChatGPT’s potential in providing medical information for inflammatory bowel disease patients. While promising, it highlights the need for advanced techniques like reasoning + action and retrieval-augmented generation to improve accuracy and reliability. Emphasizing that simple question and answer testing is insufficient, it calls for more nuanced evaluation methods to truly gauge large language models’ capabilities in clinical applications.",
