    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) models frequently rely on training data that may include sensitive or personal information, raising substantial privacy concerns. Legislative frameworks such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) have necessitated the development of strategies that preserve privacy while maintaining the utility of data. In this paper, we investigate the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic datasets integrated with Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms, thereby enabling data-driven research and model training without direct exposure of sensitive information. Our approach incorporates DP-based noise injection methods, including Laplace and Gaussian distributions, into the data generation process. We then evaluate the utility of these DP-enhanced synthetic datasets by comparing the performance of ML models trained on them against models trained on the original data. To substantiate privacy guarantees, we assess the resilience of the generated synthetic data to membership inference attacks and related threats. The experimental results demonstrate that integrating DP within LLM-driven synthetic data generation offers a viable balance between privacy protection and data utility. This study provides a foundational methodology and insight into the privacy-preserving capabilities of LLMs, paving the way for compliant and effective ML research and applications.",
