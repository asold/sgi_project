Introduction \nPower system development is reflected in the development of all the power system devices \ngenerators, transformers with different size s, transmission lines  and the protection \nequipment. Modern power transformer is one of the most vital devices of the electric power \nsystem and its protection is critical. For this reason, the protection of power transformers has \ntaken an important consideration by the resear chers. One of the most effective transformer \nprotection methods is the differential prot ection algorithm. Typically, transformer \nprotection is focused on discriminating the internal faults from the magnetizing inrush \ncurrents in the power transformers and overcoming the CTs related issues [1 -5].  \n2. Conventional differential protection scheme \nThis scheme is based on the principle that the input power to the power transformer under \nnormal conditions is equal to the output power. Under normal conditions, no current will flow \ninto the differential relay current coil. Whenever a fault occurs, within the protected zone, the \ncurrent balance will no longer exist, and relay co ntacts will close and release a trip signal to \ncause the certain circuit breakers (CBs) to operate in order to disconnect the faulty \nequipment/part. The differential relay compares the primary and secondary side currents of \nthe power transformer. Current transformers (CTs) are used to reduce the amount of currents \nin such a way their secondary side currents are equal. Fig. 1 shows the differential relay in its \nsimplest form. The polarity of CTs is such as to make the current circulate normally without \ngoing through the relay, during normal load conditions and external faults.  \nCurrent transformers ratings are selected carefully to be matched with the power \ntransformer current ratings to which they ar e connected so as the CTs secondary side \ncurrents are equal. However, the problem is that  the CTs ratios available in the market have \nstandard ratings. They are not available exac tly as the desired ratings. Therefore, the \n \nMATLAB – A Fundamental Tool for Scientific Computing and Engineering Applications – Volume 1 220 \nprimary ratings of the CTs are usually limited to  those of the available standard ratio CTs. \nCommonly the primary side of the current tr ansformer has only on e turn (1) and the \nsecondary side has many turns depending on th e transformation ratio (N) of the CT, which \nis selected to match the ratings of the power transformer. Since the transformation ratio of \ntransformers is the ratio between the number of  turns in the primary side to the number of \nthe turns in the secondary side. Therefore, the turn ratio of the primary current transformer \nis \nଵ\nேభ\n and the turn ratio of the seco ndary side current transformer is \t\nଵ\nேమ\n\t. The secondary \ncurrent of the CT located in the primary side of the power transformer is [2], [6-7]; \n ଵ =\t\nூ೛\nேభ\n\t  (1) \nWhere:  \n௣ : the primary side current of the power transformer,  \nଵ : the secondary side current ofଵ. \nଵ : the number of turns in the secondary side ofଵ \nIn the same manner for the CT located at the secondary side of the power transformer, the \nCT secondary current is: \n ଶ =\t\nூೞ\nேమ\n\t (2) \nWhere:  \n௦ : secondary side current of the power transformer, \nଶ : secondary side current ofଶ. \nଶ : number of turns in the secondary side ofଶ \n \nFigure 1.

Output currents of the CTs are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction  \nIf there is any fault in the power tr ansformer protected zone, the currents ଶ are no \nlonger equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. That means the differential \ncurrentߠhas a significant value as shown in figure 3.  \n \nFigure 3. Output currents of the CTs are not equal in magnitude and not opposite in direction  \nThe amount of current ߠinduces the relay operating coil to operate in order to send \na trip signal to the circuit breakers to isolate the transformer.  \nFrom equation (4) the secondary current with respect to the primary current of the power \ntransformer is [2], [6-7]; \n ௦ =\t\nூ೛×ே೛\nேೞ\n\t (5) \nTherefore, by manipulating equations (3) and (5),  \n 2          180o            1\n           ݀ܫ       \n \n݀ܫ 2\n1\n \nMATLAB – A Fundamental Tool for Scientific Computing and Engineering Applications – Volume 1 222 \nௗ =\nூ೛\nேభ\n−\t\nூ೛×൫ே೛ ேೞ⁄ ൯\nேమ\n\t. \n ௗ =\nூ೛\nேభ\nቀ1−\t\nே೛ ேೞ⁄\nேమ ேభ⁄ ቁ\t (6) \nቀ 1−\t\nே೛ ேೞ⁄\nேమ ேభ⁄ ቁ. \nFrom equation (6) it is obvious that the term ߣm u s t  b e  e q u a l  t o  z e r o  i n  o r d e r  t o  m a k e   \nௗ =0   \n( 1−\t\nே೛ ேೞ⁄\nேమ ேభ⁄  ) = 0 \n \nேమ\nேభ\n=\nே೛\nேೞ\n (7) \nEquation (7) gives the condition for the security  of the differential relay, which means the \nreciprocal of the ratio of the secondary side tu rns of the CTs must equa l to the turns ratio of \nthe power transformer.  \nIn power transformers, the input power is equa l to the output power. However, the voltage \nand the current in both the primary and secondary sides are different depending on \nwhether the transformer is step up or step down . For instance, if the transformer is step up \nthat means; the input voltage of the power transformer is low and the current is high, \nmeantime the voltage in the secondary side is high and the current is low. This action makes \nboth the input and output power equal. Due to  this nature the CTs in the primary and the \nsecondary sides of the power transformer do not have same turn ratio. However, they are \ncarefully selected, in terms of turn ratio and ma gnetizing characteristics, so that they have \nthe same output current at normal conditio ns of operations. If identical CTs are not \navailable, the closer ones are chosen and th en the mismatch between  them is compensated \nby using the interposing CTs. The interposing CTs can fix the mismatch in the CTs; however \nthey add their own burden to the output of the main CTs.  \nThe same argument is applied for three phase )߶transformers, except some extra issues \nmay appear in polyphase transformers. Figure 4 shows the schematic diagram of the ߶ \ndifferential protection.  \nIn some cases, of ߶power transformer connections as shown in figure 5, a 30௢ phase shift \nbetween primary and secondary currents is taking  place. This phase shift occurs in the Y-  \nor -Y connected transformers due to the transformation of the current from Y-  or -Y as \nillustrated in the figure 4. This phase shift can be corrected easily by connecting the CTs \nsecondary circuits in opposite way to the way that the power transformer phases are \nconnected. I.e. if the transformer windings are connected in Y- the CTs secondary windings \nshould be connected in -Y and vice versa [20]. As shown in figure 4 the relation between \nthe line-to-line voltage ௅௅) to the phase voltage (௣௛) can explain the phase shift between \nthe -Y transformer connection. The following eq uation gives the relationship between the \nline-to-line voltage ௅௅) to the phase voltage (௣௛) [2], [3], [6], [7]: \n \nDigital Differential Protection of Power Transformer Using Matlab 223 \n௏ೌ್\nଶݏ݋ܿ.\t\n \n௏ೌ್\nଶ௔௡\t√ଷ\nଶ   (8) \t\n௔௕ = √3௔௡\t \n \nFigure 4.

Differential protection difficulties \nGenerally, three main difficulties handicap th e conventional differential protection. They \ninduce the differential relay to release a false trip signal without the existing of any fault. \nThese complications must be overcome in order to make the differential relay working \nproperly [2], [3]:  \n Magnetizing inrush current during initial energization, \n CTs Mismatch and saturation, \n Transformation ratio changes due to Tap changer. \n3.1. Magnetizing inrush current \nThis phenomenon, the tr ansient magnetizing inrush or the exciting current, occurs in the \nprimary side of the transformer whenever the transformer is switched on (energized) and \nthe instantaneous value of the voltage is not at \t90଴. At this time, the fi rst peak of the flux \nwave is higher than the peak of the flux at the steady state condition. This current appears as \nan internal fault, and it is sensed as a differential current by the differential relay. The value \nof the first peak of the magnetizing current may be as high as several times the peak of the \nfull load current. The magnitude and duration  of the magnetizing inrush current is \ninfluenced by many factors, some of these factors are [2], [6], [7]; \n The instantaneous value of the voltage waveform at the moment of closing CB, \n The value of the residual (remnant) magnetizing flux, \n The sign of the residual magnetizing flux, \n The type of the iron laminations used in the transformer core, \n The saturation flux density of the transformer core, \n The total impedance of the supply circuit, \n The physical size of the transformer, \n The maximum flux-carrying capability of the iron core laminations, \n The input supply voltage level,  \nThe effect of the inrush current on the differ ential relay is false tripping the transformer \nwithout of any existing type of faults. From the principle of operation of the differential \nrelay, the relay compares the currents coming from both sides of the power transformer as \nexplained above. However, the inrush current is flowing only in the primary side of the \npower transformer. So that, the differential current will have a significant value due to the \nexistence of current in only on e side. Therefore, the relay has to be designed to recognize \nthat this current is a normal phenomenon and to not trip due to this current.  \n3.2. False trip due to C.T characteristics \nThe performance of the differential relays depends on the accuracy of the CTs in \nreproducing their primary currents in their se condary side. In many cases, the primary \n \nDigital Differential Protection of Power Transformer Using Matlab 225 \nratings of the CTs, located in the high voltage and low voltage sides of the power \ntransformer, does not exactly match the power transformer rated currents. Due to  \nthis discrepancy, a CTs mismatch takes place, which in turn creates a small false \ndifferential current, depending on the amount of this mismatch. Sometimes, this amount \nof the differential current is enough to operate the differential relay. Therefore, CTs ratio \ncorrection has to be done to overcome this CTs mismatch by using interposing CTs of \nmulti taps [8].  \nAnother problem that may face the perfect oper ation of the CTs is the saturation problem. \nWhen saturation happens to one or all CTs at different levels, false differential current \nappears in the differential relay. This differe ntial current could cause mal-operation of the \ndifferential relay. The dc component of the primary side current could produce the worst \ncase of CT saturation. In which, the seco ndary current contains dc offset and extra \nharmonics [9], [10]. \n3.3. False trip due to tap changer \nOn-Load Tap-Changer (OLTC) is installed on the power transformer to control \nautomatically the transformer ou tput voltage. This device is  required wherever there are \nheavy fluctuations in the power system voltage.  The transformation ratio of the CTs can be \nmatched with only one point of the tap-changing  range. Therefore, if the OLTC is changed, \nunbalance current flows in the differential relay operating coil. This action causes CTs \nmismatches. This current will be considered as a fault current which makes the relay to \nrelease a trip signal [11], [12]. \n4. Digital differential protection \nMany digital algorithms have been used so far after the invention of the computer. These \nalgorithms do the same job with different  accuracy and speed. The acceptable speed \naccording to IEEE standard for transformer prot ection is 100 msec. All modern algorithms \nare faster than this IEEE standard. Nowadays , there are some algorithms performs their \nfunction in less than 10 msec. In this chapter, a fast algorithm is introduced. Its speed is in \nthe range of 1 to 15 msec. This algorithm is ba sed on the Fast Fourier algorithm (FFT). This \nalgorithm is not new, however, significant changes has been introduced to make it much \nfaster.  \nThe proposed digital differential relay is desi gned using a simulation technique in Matlab \nSimulink environment. The design is implemen ted to protect the power transformer against \ninternal faults and prevent interruption due to inrush currents. \nThis algorithm is built on the principle of harmonic-current restraint, where  \nthe magnetizing-inrush current is charac terized by large harmonic components  \ncontent that are not noticeably present in fault currents. Due to the saturated condition of \nthe transformer iron, the waveform of the inrush current is highly distorted. The \n \nMATLAB – A Fundamental Tool for Scientific Computing and Engineering Applications – Volume 1 226 \namplitude of the harmonics, compared with the fundamental is somewhere between 30% \nto 60% and the third harmonic 10% to 30%. The other harmonics are progressively less [3] \n[6], [13].

The harmonic comparator \nshows in Fig. 14 that the value of the 2nd harm onic is higher than 0.3 of the fundamental \ncomponent.  \n \n \n \n \nFigure 13.

Amplitude comparator results for the 1st case. \nIn this case the harmonic calculation part released logic (0) but the amplitude comparator \nshowed in Fig. 15 that the differential current  is equal to the inrush current, where both \ncurves are drown over each other, then the am plitude comparator release logic (1). For this \nlogic coordination (0,1) no trip signal is released. \n\n \nDigital Differential Protection of Power Transformer Using Matlab 233 \nCase 2: Magnetizing inrush with adding load: \nThis test is carried out after the energization of the power transformer by switching ON the \nCB1 at 0.1sec and CB2 at 0.3 sec from the beginning of the simulation to see the effect of load \nexcursion on the accuracy of the designed approach. Theref ore, a 500W resistive load is \nadded to the system at 0.3 sec. Consequent ly, the inrush current disappeared and load \ncurrent started to flow in the primary and secondary circuits of the transformer according to \nthe transformation ratio of the power transf ormer as shown in Fig. 16. However, the \namplitude of the output currents of the pr imary and secondary CTs are equal due to the \nproper selection of the transformation ratio of the primary and secondary CTs, which can \nobviously noticed in Fig. 18. Where, before the time 0.3 sec the differential current was equal \nto the inrush current, but after the swathing ON  of the load the differential current went to \nzero and the primary and secondary currants became equal.  \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 16. Normal load current starts flowing at 0.3sec. \nAs shown in Fig. 17, after the switching of CB2, the value of the 2nd harmonic become lower \nthan 0.3 of the fundamental component. Accordingly, the harmonic calculation part released \nlogic (1) but the amplitude comparator released logic (0). Consequently, for this logic \ncoordination (1,0) no trip signal is releas ed. Figure 18 shows the amplitude comparator \nresults. \n\n \nMATLAB – A Fundamental Tool for Scientific Computing and Engineering Applications – Volume 1 234 \n \n \nFigure 17. 2nd harmonic and the fundamental component for the 2nd case. \n \nFigure 18.

In this case, a significant increase of the \n\n \nDigital Differential Protection of Power Transformer Using Matlab 235 \nprimary current takes place due to the fault occurrence inside the protected zone at 0.5 sec \nas shown in Fig. 19. The relay detected this  increase using the harmonic and amplitude \ncomparators and realized it as an internal fa ult. Consequently the transformer is isolated \nfrom the grid. Also it is obvious from Fig. 20 that the relay has released a trip signal after \n0.57 msec after the occurrence of the fault, whic h can be considered as a very good speed to \nisolate the transformer.  \nAs shown in Fig. 21, after the occurrence of th e fault at time 0.5 sec, the value of the 2nd \nharmonic increased during the transient time and then decreased rapidly to a value lower than \n0.3 of the fundamental component once the st eady state is achieved. Accordingly, the \nharmonic calculation part released logic (1). Also from Fig. 22 which sh ows the result of the \namplitude comparator the value of the differe ntial current is no longer equal to zero. \nAccordingly the amplitude comparator released logic (1). Therefore, for this logic coordination \n(1,1) a trip signal is released in order to isolate the power transformer from the grid. \n \nFigure 19.

Conclusions \nThis chapter is talking about the implementation and simulati on of a small power system \nwith a differential protection for the power tr ansformer. The implemen tation is shown in \nstep by step. This simulation is tested for vari ous cases and for all cases it gave satisfactory \nresults. All the tests gave satisfactory result s. There are some difficulties are faced in the \nimplantation of this system su ch as the lack of some toolbox in the Sim-power-system. For \nexample, there is no current tran sformer in the toolbox. In this  case, there are two choices to \nsolve this problem. The first one is to use a regular single phase and make some changes in \nits specification to fit the current transforme r specifications. The second one is to use a \ncurrent measurement, but this one will not simulate the problems of the CTs.  \nAuthor details \nAdel Aktaibi and M.
