INTRODUCTION \nIn order to determine the optimal number and power \nof electric transformers in underground power stations, it \nis mainly sought to obtain the most technically and eco-\nnomically convenient parameters (Song, Rinne, & van \nWageningen, 2013; Jonek-Kowalska & Tchorzewski, \n2016; Peralta, Sasmito, & Kumral, 2016; Dubinski, \nPrusek, & Turek, 2017). In this respect, it is necessary to \ndraw up a study based on the following elements: \n– daily load curve for one work day and one rest day, \nduring typical consumption periods, summer and winter; \n– annual load curve; \n– curve of the classified annual loads; \n– the total maximum load, calculated from the  \ndata on the load curves, plus the technological losses in \nthe low or medium voltage electrical networks and in \nthe transformers. \nIn order to determine the optimal number and power of \nthe electrical transformers with which underground elec-\ntrical distribution stations are equipped, the technical-\neconomic and safety criteria in the power supply of the \nmining consumers are used (Beshta 2012; Choi, Lee, Lee, \nLee, & Kang, 2018). The safety level required in the pow-\ner supply of underground consumers connected to a min-\ning transformer station is achieved, if a reserve of power is \ncreated in terms of the number of installed transformers. \nA problem that still needs to be considered when choos-\ning the size of the transformers is the evolution of the load \nover time, in which case two types of compromises have \nto be taken into account (Zlender & Kravanja, 2011; \nBasu, 2017; Erdogan, Cigla, Topal, & Yavuz, 2017): \nD. Pasculescu, L. Pana, V.M. Pasculescu, F. Deliu. (2019). Mining of Mineral Deposits, 13(2), 1-16 \n \n2 \n– statically, if the load to be provided remains ap-\nproximately constant and a compromise has to be made \nbetween choosing a higher power transformer that has a \nlower recovery cost on the installed kVA and a greater \nnumber of transformers running in parallel (only for \ntransformation and distribu tion stations at the surface), \nwhich reduces the reserve needed because the conse-\nquences of a transformation unit failure are reduced; \n– from a dynamic point of view, taking into account \nthe increase in the load over time, the relevant problem is \nto know for how many years a transformer has to be \ninstalled. If the number of y ears is low, the cost of re-\nplacing transformers will also increase, and if the number \nof years is high, higher power transformers that will need \nto be installed to avoid these frequent replacements also \nincur large expenses. \nThere is also an optimal compromise in this area. In \nthis context, the problem of normalizing the power steps \nof transformers also arises because it is not advisable to \nuse a number of different types of devices, both in terms \nof manufacturing costs (seria l effect) and maintenance \ncosts in respect to a certain number of devices of each \ntype (Doneva, Despodov, Mirakovski, Hadzi-Nikolova, \n& Mijalkovski, 2015; Krawczyk, Majer, & Krzemien, \n2016; Cichy, Sakowicz, & Kaminski, 2018). \nFinally, some limitations of technical nature have to \nbe mentioned, such as: maximum number of gauges that \ncannot be exceeded due to the difficult underground \ntransport conditions; maximum short-circuit powers at \nlower voltage levels a.s.o., which can lead to choosing \nvalues lower than the optimal ones, resulting in the \nabove compromises. \nAs it has been shown in this paper, establishing the \noptimum operating mode for a transformer is not such a \nsimple problem. As a result, the analysis underlying \nevaluation of offers for the purchase of transformers is \nnot easy either. \n2. STATIC PROBLEM OF DETERMINING \nTHE OPTIMUM NUMBER OF \nTRANSFORMERS CORRESPONDING \nTO A MINIMUM ANNUAL COST \nThe first problem to be analysed is that of determining \nthe optimal number of transformers to be installed in an \nunderground distribution station in a given year. To begin \nwith, we assume that the power to be provided by the \nunderground distribution station remains approximately \nconstant over time and that the power of the transformers \nis not subject to certain technical and safety restrictions \n(Meira, Ruschetti, Alvarez, & Verucchi, 2018). \nIn accordance with the general theory of the design \nand construction of underground and surface power \ntransformers, it can be considered that the active material \nwithin the same series of transformers, power losses \nrelated to the idle operation of the transformer and the \nlosses in short-circuit regime operation are generally \ngrouped around a characteristic that varies once with the \napparent nominal power of the transformer to the β  \npower, according to equation (1): \nβ=⋅ nTYK S ,         ( 1 )  \nwhere: \nY – characteristic to which reference is made (loss of \npower in idle operation, loss of power in short-circuit \noperation etc.); \nSnT – the nominal apparent power of the transformer \nin kVA; \nK – coefficient or proportionality factor specific to \neach characteristic, an exponent that can take the value \n2/3 or 3/4 for some series of transformers. \nSimilarly, as mentioned above, it is considered that \nthe cost of the transformer follows the same law of varia-\ntion. To determine the optimal number of transformers \nfrom a transformer station, we will assume the following: \nS – the maximum consumption served by the trans-\nformation or distribution station, MW; \nS\nnT – the apparent nominal power of the transformer \ninstalled in the transformer or distribution station, MVA; \nN – number of transformers installed in a power dis-\ntribution station; \nCT – the cost of a power transformer SnT, €; \nCct – the cost of a transformer cell from a transformer \nor distribution station, €; \nγk – the equivalent annual cost of a Joule loss mega-\nwatt at the annual load peak, €/MW; \nγ0 – the annual cost of a megawatt of losses, constant \nthroughout the year (iron losses in transformers), €/MW. \n2.1. Analytical expression of transformers cost \nThe following transformer cost variation law accord-\ning to size was admitted: \n0\n0\nβ\nβα=⋅ = ⋅ \n\nnT\nTT T nT\nT\nSCC S S ,     (2) \nwhere: \nCT0 – cost of a power transformer ST0. \nThis law in S βnT, results from the fact for a given in-\nduction and current density, the mass of a transformer \nvaries sensitively with the β power from the nominal \napparent power of the transformer. \n2.2. Active power losses in idle operation \nThe law that gives the variation of active power loss \nin idle operation, depending on the nominal apparent \npower of the transformer, is in a first approximation of \nthe same form as the preceding one:  \n00\n0\n \nβ\nβαΔ= Δ ⋅ = ⋅ \n\nnT\nFe Fe nT\nT\nSPP S S\n.     (3) \n2.3. Active power losses in short-circuit operation \nFor a given transformer family (i.e. for transformers \nhaving the same primary and secondary voltages), the \nresistance R varies sensibly, inversely proportional to the \napparent rated power of the transformer: \n00⋅= ⋅nT TRS R S .       (4) \nJoule power losses (ΔPk) for the annual load peak or \nthe active power losses in short-circuit operation in a trans-\nformer are calculated based on the following equations: \n22 2\n00\n22 2 2 2 α⋅⋅Δ= = ⋅ = ⋅\n⋅⋅ ⋅\nT\nkk\nnT nT\nRSRS S SP\nUn U nS nS\n,    (5) \nD.

Analytical expression of annual \ninvestment costs and power losses \nNext, if a is the update rate, the annual global invest-\nment costs and power losses are: \n() 00 γγ=⋅⋅ + +⋅ Δ ⋅ +⋅ Δ ⋅Tc t k kCn a C C nP nP .   (7) \nIf the relations (2), (3) and (6) are replaced in the ana-\nlytical expression (7), it results in: \n() 00\n22/3 .\nαα γ\nαγ\n=⋅⋅ +⋅ ⋅ + ⋅ ×\n×+ ⋅ ⋅ ⋅\nct T\nnT k k\nnT\nCn a C n a\nSS nS\n    (8) \nIn order to simplify the power supply safety issue, it \nis assumed in this calculation that the supply of the con-\nsumers at load peak can be ensured by other means in the \ncase of the transformer unavailability, taking into ac-\ncount the following equation: \n()1.25 1⋅− ⋅ = nTnSS ,      (9) \nwhere: \n1.25 is the maximum admitted overload factor for a \ntransformer in case of failure. \nIf SnT is replaced by its expression in terms of S, the \nvalue of the annual cost is: \n22/3\n=⋅ ⋅ + ⋅ ⋅ + ⋅ ⋅\nnT\nnT\nSCKA n B n S C nS\n,  (10) \nwhere: \n00\n1.15 ;\n;\n1.43 ,\nαα γ\nαγ\n=⋅ ⋅\n=⋅ + ⋅\n=⋅ ⋅\nct\nT\nkk\nAa C\nBa\nC\n,     ( 1 1 )  \nand K, being a factor resulting from the calculations \nperformed, has a value of 0.69. \nAfter performing the replacements, the expression of \nthe annual cost can be written as follows: \n()\n2/3\n2/3\n1\n1\n −=⋅ ⋅ + ⋅ ⋅ + ⋅ ⋅ −\nSnCKA n B n C S nn\n.

(13) \nThis relationship shows that n cannot be more than 3 \nand that the coefficients A, B and C are positive. In prac-\ntice, it can be verified that the value of the minimum cost \nis always obtained for n = 2. \nI f  t h e  f u n c t i o n  F(S)  i s  c o n s i d e r e d  t o  b e  e q u a l  t o  t h e  \nannual cost difference corresponding to n = 2 and n = 3, \nit results in the following: \n() 2/30.11 6\n=⋅ − ⋅ ⋅ + ⋅\nSFS K A BS C .  (14) \nThe minimum of this function is: \n3\nmin 0.44=⋅\nBS C\n.     ( 1 5 )  \nIt can be noted that F(Smin) is always close to the  \nvalue K·A·C >0. \nFinally, it is mentioned that the optimal number of \ntransformers in a tr ansformer station is two or three, \ndepending on the safety criteria adopted, and that a larger \nnumber of power transformers can only result from tech-\nnical conditions independent of the economic optimum. \n3. DETERMINATION OF MINING \nTRANSFORMERS OPTIMAL POWER \nBASED ON ECONOMIC CRITERIA \nIn order to determine the optimum power of a trans-\nformer, namely the setting of the initial values for the \nfirst year of operation (load cofactor at its lower limit \nk\nl.inf) of loads at the annual load peak, the following op-\ntimization criteria can be used, namely (Pasculescu, \nVlasin, Florea, & Suvar, 2017; Pasculescu, Vlasin, Su-\nvar, & Lupu, 2017): \n– minimum updated total expenses (CTA), which \ntakes into account both the cost of the transformer and \nthe loss of power and energy. If the update rate is not \ntaken into account, there is a  particular case consisting in \nminimizing the annual calculation costs; \n– minimum power and energy losses (CPW), in \nwhich case the cost of the transformer is neglected. \nIn the case of a transformer, an economic operation pe-\nriod is defined as the number of years until its maximum \nload level increases about 1.6 times the initial value, \nconsidere d ec onom ically optim al for t he fi r st year since  \ninstallation (Pasculescu, Lupu, Pasculescu, Inisconi, & \nSuvar, 2012; Chueco, Lopez, & Bobadilla, 2015; Gouda \n& El Dein, 2015; Vagonova, & Volosheniuk, 2012). \nThe “n” number of years for one of these economic \nintervals of the transformer depends primarily on the \nvalue of the increase in the annual load peak during that \nperiod and can be approximat ed with sufficient accuracy \nbased on the equation (16): \n()11 . 6+= nr ,      ( 1 6 )  \nwhere: \nr – coefficient that takes into account the dynamics of \nthe load during the considered period. \n3.1. Minimum updated total expenses criterion \nThe analytical expression of the updated total ex-\npenses (CTA) determined for the purchase, installation \nand operation of a power transformer at a certain load \nregime over a period of n years can be determined as: \nD.

Case study 1 \nFigure 2a – 2f show the values of the initial economic \nloads for different values of the kilowatt-hour losses cost \nC\nW a n d  p a r a m e t e r s  o f  t h e  c u r r e n t  s e r i e s  o f  T T  –  A N   \nexplosion-proof mining power transformers. \nThe economic power (SM1) and the optimum load fac-\ntor (kV = kl.inf) for the TT – AN 6/0.4 kV series of trans-\nformers were determined considering mr = 1 for the two \nassumptions analysed according to the value of β. \nI n  t h e  f i r s t  c a s e ,  w e  c o n s i d e r e d  β = 0.66, and in the \nsecond case β = 0.75. We also considered the increase \nrate of the annual peak loads r = 0, so the load is as-\nsumed to be constant over a year. The abscissa of the \nintersection point D, and, respectively, the ordinate of the \nintersection point D, were calculated for m\nr = 1. \nThe intersection point D of the three characteristics, \nwhich correspond to the differe nt specific cost values of \nthe kilowatt-hour losses cost CW, was not shown on the \ngraphs below to avoid too bulky figures. This was high-\nlighted in Figure 1. \nThe number of hours of the annual maximum load \nuse corresponding to the intersection point D, \n(T\nmax.D = TD), was determined by equation (39). The \ncalculation time of the annual technological losses τ was \ncalculated by equation (22). \nThe results obtained from the simulation as well as \nthe input data for the parameters of the transformers \nanalysed are summarized in Table 1. \nThe graphs shown in Figure 2a – 2f were plotted using \nthe Matlab-Simulink software package for the TT – AN \ntransformer series with 250, 400 and 500 kVA nominal \npowers, and the transformation ratio 6/0.4 kV, taking into \naccount the annual growth rate r of the load peaks. \nThe economic power of the transformer is, in fact, the \nmaximum value of a constant power over the duration of \nthe operation which, when transiting through the trans-\nformer, produces minimum power losses. Low-loss \ntransformers use more and better materials for their con-\nstruction and are thus initially more expensive than low-\ncost transformers. For distribution and power transfor-\nmers, which operate continuously and most frequently in \nloaded condition, this consideration is especially im-\nportant. By stipulating loss evaluation figures in the \ntransformer inquiry, the manufacturer receives the neces-\nsary incentive to provide a loss-optimized transformer \nrather than the low-cost model. \nIt can also be observed that with the increase in the \nspecific power losses cost (C\nW), the optimal load factor at \nthe annual load peak ( kV) decreases or increases, depen-\nding on the variation in the use time of the maximum \nannual load. In the case studies presented in this section, \nthe value of the specific cost of power installed in base \nequivalent stations in updated values is C\nP = 1250 €/kW \nrespective to the real value of the specific power losses \ncost CW 0.06 €/kWh. \n3.1.2. Case study 2 \nFigure 3a – 3d show the values of the initial economic \nloads for different values of the kilowatt-hour losses cost \nC\nW and of the parameters of the current series TT – AN \n6/0.69 kV explosion-proof mining power transformers.  \nThe results obtained from the simulation as well as \nthe input data for the parameters of the transformers \nanalysed are summarized in Table 2. \nThe graphs shown in Figure 3a – 3d were plotted using \nthe Matlab-Simulink software package for the TT – AN \ntransformer series with 400 and 500 kVA nominal powers, \nand the transformation ratio 6/0.69 kV, not taking into \naccount the annual growth rate r of the load peaks. \nA simplified method for a quick evaluation of differ-\nrent quoted transformer losses involves the following \nassumptions: \n– the transformers operate continuously; \n– the transformers operate at a partial load, but this \npartial load is constant; \n– additional cost and inflation factors are not considered; \n– demand charges are based on 100% load. \n3.1.3. Case study 3 \nFigure 4a – 4f show the values of the initial economic \nloads for different values of the kilowatt-hour losses cost \nC\nW and the parameters of the current series TT – AN \n6/1.05 kV explosion-proof mining power transformers. \nThe results obtained from the simulation as well as \nthe input data for the parameters of the transformers \nanalyzed are summarized in Table 3.

Case study 1 \nFigure 5a – 5f present the initial values of the optimal \nload factors ( kl.inf) for the series of TT – AN mining \ntransformers of 6/0.4 kV and the final maximum load \nvalues (k\nl.sap) for which it is advisable to replace with an \nimmediately higher power rating, calculated with the \nCTA method and the CPW method. \nAs can be seen from the following diagrams, the ini-\ntial values of the load factors in the hypothesis of a min-\nimum CPW result in about 25% lower value than the \nassumed minimum of total updated expenses. \nThe optimal load factors ( k\nl.inf = kl.i, kl.sup = kl.s) were \ncalculated on the basis of the current cost of the kilowatt-\nhour electricity losses, respectively with CW = 0.06 €/kWh. \nThe load is considered constant over time, so the load \nmultiplier is mr = 1. The input data for 6/0.4 kV TT – AN \ntype transformers are shown in Table 1. \n3.2.2. Case study 2 \nFigure 6a – 6d present the values of the initial and fi-\nnal economic loads for the annual load peaks ( kl.inf = kl.i, \nkl.sup = kl.s), neglecting the growth rate r of the load (for \nr = 0 (results mr = 1) for the current series of TT – AN \ntransformers of 6/0.69 kV depending on the maximum \nannual load usage time TM, by using also the two optimi-\nzation criteria analysed in this section, namely: the CTA \ncriterion and the CPW criterion. \nThe graphs in Figure 6a – 6d were plotted using the \nMatlab-Simulink software package. The input data for \n6/0.69 kV TT – AN transformer parameters are synthe-\nsized in Table 2. \nIt can also be noted that the energy losses during \nidling are of great importance, although the value of the \npower loss is 18 – 25% of th e value of the losses asso-\nciated with the maximum duration of the load. \nThis is generally due to charging under the  \nrated power of the transformer, which is usually \n1 < k\nl.inf = SM1/SnT < 3.2 and τ between 2500 and 5000 h/yr. \nIn the case of the TT – AN mining transformer  \nof 6/0.69 kV, 500 kVA resulted in the loss ratio  \nΔP0/ ΔPk = 1.02, because iron losses are higher than \ncopper losses.  \nFor values of the fill coefficient 0.35 and 0.6, the \neconomic load factor value is 87.46 and 96.25% respec-\ntively. In this situation, it will not operate at such loads as \nit is very dangerous during charge peaks, which exceed \nthe transformer power, have S\nmax = 2.5SnT. Also, it will be \nwatched in operation that the transformer will operate at \na lower limit load. If the transformer operates at the cal-\nculated economic load factor [1.2, 1.5], the energy losses \nare high (ΔW\na = [90.79, 131.17] kWh/day). \n3.2.3. Case study 3 \nFigure 7a – 7f present the values of the initial and final \neconomic loads for the annual load peaks ( kl.inf = kl.i, \nkl.sup = kl.s), neglecting the growth rate r of the load for the \ncurrent series of TT – AN transformers of 6/1.05 kV de-\npending on the maximum annual load usage time TM, by \nusing the two optimization criteria CTA and the CPW. If \nthe growth rate of the annual load peaks is not taken into \naccount, the initial loading coefficient resulting from the \ncalculation, regardless of the analysis criteria presented in \nthis paper (CTA and CPW), will be taken less, in order to \nleave a reserve in case of future consumption increase. \nIn other terms, knowing that for the calculation of the \noptimal load capacity of the transformers, the maximum \npower enters the first year of exploitation, we can con-\nclude that in determining this power (and thus the load \nfactor), two elements must be taken into account: \n– the loss factor calculation value, which as has been \ns h o w n ,  t y p i c a l l y  h a s  a  v a l u e  d i f f e r e n t  f r o m  t h e  a c t u a l  \nvalue; \n– the value of the iron and copper losses of the trans-\nformer ( ΔP\n0, ΔPk), which also differ depending on the \ndifferent types of transformers, or which may undergo \nchanges over time as a result of repairs, for the same \ntypes of transformers. \nThe calculated charge is hypothetical because the ac-\ntual load in operation is different from the one resulting \nfrom the calculations made for different types of trans-\nformers. If the real load is equal to the calculated value, \nthis would be valid for a short time [1, 2], or the CTA \ncalculation is done over a long time [20, 30], during \nwhich the load will certainly be varied within certain \nlimits, compared to the initial load (optimum load factor \nin the first year of operation).  \nD.

CONCLUSIONS \nThe central theme of this paper is determination of \nthe optimal number and optimal coefficient of power \ntransformers incineration in underground mining. \nCurrently, in the majority of cases encountered in \npractice, it is economically f easible for the underground \ndistribution stations to be equipped with as few trans-\nformers as possible. \nIn some cases, when the safety conditions in the  \npower supply require it, or when the consumption ex-\nceeds the maximum power of the existing units, several \ntransformer units can be provided in an underground \ndistribution station. \nDetermining the optimal number and power of trans-\nformers by economic criteria refers to all nominal power \nsteps of a series of transformers designed on a unitary basis. \nThe number of transformers that will equip the trans-\nformer station or power plant shall not be greater than \nthree and shall be set in such a way as to ensure continui-\nty in the electricity supply to consumers, according to \ntheir category of importance: \n– for zero-rated consumers, a 100% reserve is provided; \n– in the case of category I important consumers, se-\nveral transformers will be sel ected so that each of them \nwill provide the power of category I or zero consumers \nas the case may be; \n– in the case of category II and III consumers of im-\nportance, no reserve is foreseen, the continuity of the \nsupply being ensured by network back-up links, where \neconomically indicated. \nThe above result (n = 2) has been achieved because of \nunavailability of a single transformer, and given the una-\nvailability of two power transformers, the number of \ntransformers within the power transformation and distri-\nbution station is n = 3. \nTo make the least possible investment, the number of \ntransformers installed in a distribution station must be mi-\nnimal.

Economic loads for annual load pe aks, determined based on the CTA and CPW cr iteria, for the current series of trans-\nformers type TT – AN, of 6/1.05 kV: (a) SnT = 250 kVA, β = 0.66; (b) SnT = 250 kVA, β = 0.75; (c) SnT = 400 kVA, β = 0.66; \n(d) SnT = 400 kVA, β = 0.75; e) SnT=630 kVA, β=0.66; f) SnT=630 kVA, β=0.75 \nThe optimal use of the tran sformer charging capacity \nallows the power to be lowered and thus to save electrici-\nty. The operating costs to be considered in the analysis \nand evaluation of the optimum operation of the trans-\nformers are due to power or energy losses. These power \nor energy losses occur both in transformers and in elec-\ntrical distribution networks during their operation. \nUnderground distribution stations should also be  \nanalysed from the point of view of the consumer, the \nenvironment in which they are located and the configu-\nration of the MV and LV power networks connected to \nthese stations. \nAnalysis of the load capacity of a transformer is usu-\nally done for several purposes: \nD. Pasculescu, L. Pana, V.M. Pasculescu, F. Deliu. (2019). Mining of Mineral Deposits, 13(2), 1-16 \n \n14 \n– for verifying the capacity of an existing transformer \nin operation to meet the requirements (without overloa-\nding in value and duration); \n– for comparing the operation regime, performed in \nrelation to the optimum regime of the existing unit; \n– for analysing the opportunity of replacing, on eco-\nnomic efficiency criteria, one transformer with another \nhaving different technical characteristics (nominal pow-\ner, power loss in idle and shor t-circuit operation, idle or \nmagnetized current, short-circuit voltages etc.). \nA correct analysis should take into account both the \ncosts of acquiring, installing and maintaining the trans-\nformer, as well as the cost of energy losses produced \nduring its operation. \nIn order to determine whether a transformer meets the \nrequirements of the network, it is obviously necessary to \nknow the consumption characteristics. \nAs it has been shown in this paper, establishing the \noptimum operating mode for a transformer is not such a \nsimple problem. As a result, the analysis and the evalua-\ntion of offers for the purchase of transformers are also \nnot easy. \nIf the assessment of acquisition, installation and \nmaintenance costs is simple, the evaluation of power and \nenergy losses and costs becomes a more complicated \nproblem because the following aspects need to be con-\nsidered when analysing the cost of losses: \n– because the load coefficient of a transformer is \ntracked across the entire range of possible loads, it is \nnormal for the cost loss analysis to be performed across \nthis range; \n– this range has to be chosen so that along its  \nentire extent the losses obtained should be as small as \npossible; \n– this range must be chosen so as to use the trans-\nformer capacity as much as possible; \n– the choice of the optimal load range has to be per-\nformed such that over its entire range no load peaks \nwould occur and which would result in hazardous over-\nloads, above the admitted limit. \nIn all practical cases, the optimal solution is to use the \ntransformer with the nominal power nearest to the theo-\nretical value resulting from the S\nNTmax calculations. \nIf transformers differing by no more than half a step \nfrom the theoretical optimum are used, CTA increase \nwill not usually exceed 2 and 3%. \nIf the S\nnTmax theoretical optimal power would result \nvery closely to a standardized value and would instead be \nchosen an immediate higher step, then CTA increases by \napproximately 10 and 12%. \nThe results obtained from the simulations presented \nin the case studies show that the values of the load fac-\ntors, and respectively the optimal power of the mining \ntransformers, are higher than those of the factors from \nthe surface because the ratio of the losses is higher. \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThe authors state that this research received no spe-\ncific grant from any funding agency in the public, com-\nmercial, or not-for-profit sectors. \nREFERENCES \nBasu, R.

У статті обговорюється проблема вибору оптимального числа шахт них трансформаторів, визначення \nкоефіцієнта їх навантаження і рентабельності протягом першого року експлуатації. \nМетодика. Для визначення кількості трансформаторів і оптимального коефіц ієнта їх навантаження запро-\nпонована математична модель на базі двох використаних економічн их критеріїв: мінімальні скориговані зага-\nльні витрати та мінімальні втрати потужності й енергії. Отриман і результати лягли в основу моделі, побудова-\nної за допомогою Matlab для декількох серій підземних шахтних трансформаторів. Прийнято, що навантаження \nзберігається постійним протягом року. \nРезультати. У статті підтверджена можливість використання аналізованих еко номічних критеріїв для ви-\nзначення оптимального числа шахтних трансформаторів і оптимальн ого коефіцієнта їх навантаження а, отже, \nоптимальної потужності протягом п ершого року їх експлуатації. С кладність дослідження полягала в оцінці \nчасових втрат. Крім того, у статті були представлені результати  та порівняльний аналіз двох використаних еко-\nномічних критеріїв. Встановлено, що оптимальним рішенням є вико ристання трансформатора з номінальною \nпотужністю, найближчою до теоретичного значення, отриманого в р езультаті розрахунків SNTmax. Результати, \nотримані при моделюванні, показують, що значення факторів наван таження, відповідно, оптимальної потужно-\nсті шахтних трансформаторів, вище, ніж у поверхових, оскільки відношення втрат вище. \nНаукова новизна.

В статье обсуждается проблема выбора оптимального числа шахтны х трансформаторов, определения \nкоэффициента их нагрузки и рентабельности в течение первого года эксплуатации. \nМетодика. Для определения количества трансформаторов и оптимального коэффициента их нагрузки пред-\nложена математическая модель на базе двух использованных экономических критериях: минимальные скоррек-\nтированные общие издержки и минимальные потери мощности и энерг ии. Полученные результаты легли в \nоснову модели, построенной с помощью Matlab для нескольких сери й подземных шахтных трансформаторов. \nПринято, что нагрузка сохраняется постоянной в течение года. \nРезультаты. В статье подтверждена возможность использования анализируемых экономических критериев \nдля определения оптимального числа шахтных трансформаторов и оп тимального коэффициента их нагрузки и, \nследовательно, оптимальной мощности в течение первого года их э ксплуатации. Сложность исследования за-\nключалась в оценке временных потерь. Кроме того, в статье были представлены результаты и сравнительный \nанализ двух использованных экономических критериев. Установлено , что оптимальным решением является \nиспользование трансформатора с н оминальной мощностью, ближайшей  к теоретическому значению, получен-\nному в результате расчетов SNTmax. Результаты, полученные при моделировании, показывают, что значения фак-\nторов нагрузки, соответственно, оп тимальной мощности шахтных тр ансформаторов, выше, чем у поверхност-\nных, поскольку отношение потерь выше. \nНаучная новизна.
