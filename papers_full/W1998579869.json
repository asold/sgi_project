To date, the isolation \nand characterisation of the gene transformer-2 in the tephritids has only been undertaken in Ceratitis, and it has been \nshown that its function is required for the female-specific splicing of doublesex and transformer pre-mRNA. It therefore \nparticipates in transformer auto-regulatory function. In this work, the ch aracterisation of this gene in eleven tephritid \nspecies belonging to the less extensively analysed genus Anastrepha was undertaken in order to throw light on the \nevolution of transformer-2.\nResults: The gene transformer-2 produces a protein of 249 amino acids in both sexes, which shows the features of the \nSR protein family. No significant partially spliced mRNA isoform specific to the male germ line was detected, unlike in \nDrosophila. It is transcribed in both sexes during development and in adult life, in both the soma and germ line. The \ninjection of Anastrepha transformer-2 dsRNA into Anastrepha embryos caused a change in the splicing pattern of the \nendogenous transformer and doublesex pre-mRNA of XX females from the female to the male mode. Consequently, \nthese XX females were transformed into pseudomales. The comparison of the eleven Anastrepha Transformer-2 \nproteins among themselves, and with the Transformer-2 proteins of other insects, suggests the existence of negative \nselection acting at the protein level to maintain Transformer-2 structural features.\nConclusions: These results indicate that transformer-2 is required for sex determination in Anastrepha through its \nparticipation in the female-specific splicing of transformer and doublesex pre-mRNAs. It is therefore needed for the \nauto-regulation of the gene transformer. Thus, the transformer/transfomer-2 > doublesex elements at the bottom of the \ncascade, and their relationships, probably represent the ancestral state (which still exists in the Tephritidae, \nCalliphoridae and Muscidae lineages) of the extant cascade found in the Drosophilidae lineage (in which tra is just \nanother component of the sex determination gene cascade regulated by Sex-lethal). In the phylogenetic lineage that \ngave rise to the drosophilids, evolution co-opted for Sex-lethal, modified it, and converted it into the key gene \ncontrolling sex determination.\nBackground\nSex determination refers to the developmental pro-\ngramme that commits the embryo to following either the\nmale or the female pathway. The past few years have seen\na great amount of interest in the evolution of develop-\nmental mechanisms at the genetic and molecular levels,\nand in determining the evolutionary processes by which\nthese mechanisms came into existence. In this respect,\nsex determination is a process that seems to be excep-\ntionally suitable for comparative study, given the great\nvariety of mechanisms that exist. Indeed, sex determina-\ntion has long been of major interest not only as a develop-\nmental process but also because of the evolutionary\nproblem it poses - a problem that can only be solved by\nidentifying and comparing the genetic structures of sex\ndetermination pathways. Molecular genetic technologies\nnow allow such comparisons to be made. In addition, sex\ndetermination in the reference system of insects - that of\nDrosophila melanogaster - is known in fine detail, making\ntruly informative comparisons possible.\n* Correspondence: lsanchez@cib.csic.es\n1 Centro de Investigaciones Biológicas (C.S.I.C.), Ramiro de Maeztu 9, 28040 \nMadrid, Spain\n† Contributed equally\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\nSarno et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:140\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/140\nPage 2 of 14\nThe characterisation of the sex determination genes in\nD. melanogaster has shown that their control during\ndevelopment is governed by the sex-specific splicing of\ntheir products (reviewed in [1]). The product of a gene\ncontrols the sex-specific splicing of the pre-mRNA from\nthe downstream gene in the genetic cascade. Sex-lethal\n(Sxl) is at the top of this cascade and acts as the memory\ndevice for female sexual development via its auto-regula-\ntory function: its product controls the splicing of its own\npre-mRNA [2,3]. In addition, Sxl controls the splicing of\nthe pre-mRNA from the downstream gene transformer\n(tra) [4-6]. The Tra product and the product of the con-\nstitutive gene transformer-2 (tra-2) control the sex-spe-\ncific splicing of pre-mRNA from the gene doublesex (dsx)\n[7-10], which is transcribed in both sexes but gives rise to\ntwo different proteins, DsxF and DsxM [11,12]. These are\ntranscription factors that impose female and male sexual\ndevelopment respectively via the sex-specific regulation\nof the so-called sexual cytodifferentiation genes.\nGenes homologous to the sex determination genes of\nD. melanogaster have been sought in other insects\n(reviewed in [13]). In the tephritid fruit flies, the gene Sxl\nhas been characterised in Ceratitis capitata [14] and in\nBactrocera oleae [15], tra has been characterised in C.\ncapitata [16], B. oleae [17] and in twelve Anastrepha spe-\ncies [18], and dsx has been characterised in C. capitata\n[19], B. oleae [15] and in eleven Anastrepha species\n[20,21].\nThe tephritid Sxl gene is not regulated in a sex-specific\nfashion, and therefore the same Sxl transcript encoding\nthe functional Sxl protein is found in both males and\nfemales [14,15]. Thus, in the tephritids, Sxl does not\nappear to play the key discriminating role (memory\ndevice) in sex determination that it plays in Drosophila.\nAs in the drosophilids, the tephritid tra gene is consti-\ntutively expressed in both sexes and its primary transcript\nshows sex-specific alternative splicing. However, whereas\nin the drosophilids Sxl regulates tra, in the tephritids this\ngene appears to have an auto-regulatory function that\nproduces functional Tra protein specifically in females.\nThe gene tra in the tephritids has male-specific exons\nthat contain translation stop codons. The incorporation\nof these exons into the mature tra mRNA in males deter-\nmines that, in this sex, a truncated, non-functional Tra\nprotein is produced. In females, the male-specific exons\nare spliced out because of the presence of Tra protein [16-\n18]. The presence of putative Tra-Tra2 binding sites in\nthe male-specific exons and in the surrounding introns\nmay suggest that the Tra2 protein participates in the tra\nauto-regulatory function. The introduction of Ceratitis\n[16] or Bactrocera [17]tra-dsRNA into Ceratitis or Bac-\ntrocera embryos, respectively, results in the destruction\nof endogenous tra function in both species and the subse-\nquent complete transformation of females into\npseudomales. Together, these results support the pro-\nposal of Pane et al. [16] that the key regulatory role played\nby tra is to act as the memory device for sex determina-\ntion via its auto-regulatory function.\nThe tephritid gene dsx codes for male- and female-spe-\ncific RNAs, which encode the male-specific and female-\nspecific Dsx proteins [15,19-21]. Putative Tra-Tra2 bind-\ning sites have been found in the female-specific exon,\nsuggesting that, as in Drosophila, male-specific splicing\nrepresents the default mode and that female-specific\nsplicing requires T ra protein, which would only be pres-\nent in females.\nSo far, the isolation and characterisation of the gene\ntransformer-2 (tra-2) in the tephritids has been only per-\nformed in C. capitata [22,23]. This gene is transcribed in\nboth sexes. The injection of Ceratitis tra-2 dsRNA into\nCeratitis embryos results in the transformation of geno-\ntypically female embryos into adult pseudomales, high-\nlighting the role of tra-2 in Ceratitis sex determination\n[23]. Its function is required for the female-specific splic-\ning of dsx and tra pre-mRNA; it therefore participates in\ntra auto-regulatory function [23].\nThe study of the evolution of the sex determination\ngene cascade (i.e., the genes and their interactions)\nrequires its characterisation in different species. To better\nanalyse the evolution of the gene tra-2, and more specifi-\ncally its pivotal role in tra auto-regulation in the tephrit-\nids, its characterisation was undertaken in eleven\ntephritid species belonging to the less extensively analy-\nsed genus Anastrepha. The present analysis therefore\nincluded Anastrepha obliqua, A. amita and A. sororcula,\nplus the four closely related species of the so-called Anas-\ntrepha fraterculus complex - A. sp.1 aff. fraterculus, A .\nsp.2 aff. fraterculus, A. sp.3 aff. fraterculus and A. sp.4 aff.\nfraterculus [24,25], all of which belong to the fraterculus\ngroup [26] - along with A. serpentina (serpentina group),\nA. striata and A. bistrigata (striata group) and A. grandis\n(grandis group) [26].\nFirstly, the gene tra-2 in the reference species A. obli-\nqua was isolated and its molecular organisation, expres-\nsion pattern and encoded product studied. Secondly, the\ntra-2 ORFs in the other Anastrepha species were identi-\nfied, and a comparative analysis of all the known insect\nTra2 proteins undertaken. Thirdly, its function in sex\ndetermination was studied by following the sexual devel-\nopment (at the morphological, chromosome and molecu-\nlar levels) of Anastrepha embryos in which endogenous\ntra-2 function was destroyed by the injection of tra-2\ndsRNA. Finally, the phylogeny of tra-2 in these species\nand in other insects was investigated.\nResults\nThe molecular organisation of tra-2 in Anastrepha obliqua, \nand its expression\nThe first step in the isolation of the A. obliqua tra-2 gene\n(Aotra2) was to perform RT-PCR on total RNA from\nSarno et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:140\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/140\nPage 3 of 14\nfemale adults. Reverse transcription was performed using\nthe primer oligo-dT, while two nested PCR reactions\nwere performed with three degenerated primers: the\nnested forward Mar17 and Mar26 primers, and the\nreverse Tra2-B primer, the latter located in the very well\nconserved RRM domain of the Tra2 protein (see Materi-\nals and Methods and Figure 1A). The first PCR reaction\nwas performed using the pair of primers Mar17 plus\nTra2B, the second using Mar26 plus Tra2B. An amplicon\nof 92 bp was amplified, cloned and sequenced. The con-\nceptual amino acid sequence of this amplicon showed a\nh i gh  d e gr ee  o f  s i m i l a ri t y  wi t h  t h e  3 '  r e gi o n  o f  t h e  RRM\ndomain of D. melanogaster Tra2 protein, indicating that a\nfragment of the putative AoTra2 protein had been iso-\nlated.\nTo determine the molecular organisation of Aotra2 the\nfollowing strategy was followed. Firstly, 3'- and 5'-RACE\nanalyses were performed. To this end, specific primers\nfrom the amplified sequenced were synthesised (see\nMaterials and Methods). These primers were used in\nnested PCR reactions involving total RNA from male and\nfemale adults. The amplicons, which were the same in\nboth sexes, were then cloned and sequenced.\nA GenomeWalker library of A. obliqua was synthesised\n(see Materials and Methods) and used to perform PCR\ngenome-walking on the genomic DNA of A. obliqua from\nthe initial amplicon towards the 5' and 3' directions (see\nMaterials and Methods for the primers used). The\ngenomic amplicons were cloned and sequenced. The\nsequences of the genomic fragments thus generated were\ncompared with the A. obliqua male and female cDNA\nsequences previously determined. In this way, the exon/\nintron junctions were unambiguously identified.\nFigure 1A shows the molecular organisation of Aotra2\nand its comparison with that of C. capitata tra-2 (Figure\n1B) and D. melanogaster tra-2 (Figure 1C). The transcrip-\ntion unit of Aotra2 was made up of 3635 bp and com-\nposed of eight exons and seven introns. The putative\ntranslation start site was the last three nucleotides of\nexon1, and the stop codon was located at 15 nucleotides\nof the beginning of exon 8. The size of the exons and\nintrons of tra-2 from Anastrepha, Ceratitis and Droso-\nphila is given as additional File 1. The sizes of the mRNAs\nencoding the Tra2 proteins shown in Figure 1 are given in\nthe legend to this Figure.\nThe molecular organisation of gene tra-2 in Anas-\ntrepha, Ceratitis and Drosophila was very similar. The\nconceptual translation of the Aotra2 mRNA encoded a\nprotein with an RNA-recognition motif (RRM) flanked\nby two arginine-serine rich regions (RS) as in Ceratitis\nand Drosophila. The RS1 domain was encoded in exons 2,\n3 and 4, the RRM domain in exons 5 and 6, and the RS2\ndomain in exons 7 and 8 in Anastrepha and 6b and 7 in\nCeratitis and Drosophila. The putative Aotra2 protein\nshould have some additional amino acids at the amino-\nterminal end preceding the RS1 domain.\nIn D. melanogaster , tra-2 gives rise to three mRNAs\n(tra2-226, tra2-264 and tra2-179) by alternative splicing\npathways and alternative promoters, which encode three\ndistinct isoforms of the Tra2 protein [27,28]. As in the\ncase of other dipterans C. capitata [23], Musca domestica\n[29] and Lucilia cuprina [30], only a single tra2 mRNA\nwas detected in A. obliqua. This was confirmed by over-\nlapping PCR on total RNA of males and females using the\nprimers shown in Figure 1A.\nThe expression of Aotra2 was studied by performing\nRT-PCR on total RNA from a mixture of male plus female\ne m b r y o s ,  f r o m  a  m i x t u r e  o f  m a l e  p l u s  f e m a l e  l a r v a e  a t\ndifferent developmental stages, from the heads plus tho-\nraces of male and female adults (separately), and from\nadult ovaries. The primers used were GW1 from exon 1\nand P4 from exon 8 (see Figure 1A). In all cases, a frag-\nment of 368 bp was amplified (Figure 1D). This was\ncloned and sequenced confirming that it corresponded to\nthe expected Aotra2 fragment. Negative controls in all\nthese PCR reactions produced no amplicons (see Materi-\nals and Methods). These results indicate that the gene\nAotra2 is expressed at all developmental stages and dur-\ning adult life in both sexes, including the ovaries of adult\nfemales, what suggests that tra-2 \nhas a maternal expres-\nsion.\nIn the male germ line of D. melanogaster, the Tra2 pro-\ntein acts negatively on the splicing of its primary tran-\nscript promoting the inclusion of intron M1 in the mRNA\n(see Figure 1C), which encodes a truncated, non-func-\ntional Tra2 protein [31]. This aberrant mRNA comprises\nabout 50% of the total tra2 mRNA in the male germ line\n[32]. This retention of the M1 intron is the mechanism by\nwhich the functional Tra2 protein limits its own synthesis\nsince the final amount of this protein is crucial for male\nfertility [33]. This negative regulation of the Tra2 protein\nis exerted by its binding to specific ISS-sequences located\nin intron M1 [34]. The existence of putative Tra2-binding\nISS sequences in intron 3 of Aotra2 gene (data not shown)\nprompted us to investigate whether the mRNA isoform\ncarrying this intron is also significantly produced in the\ntestis of A. obliqua, as a sign that tra-2 negative auto-reg-\nulation might exist in the A. obliqua male germ line. To\nthis end, RT-PCR was performed on total RNA from\nadult testis using the pair of primers P1 from exon 1 and\nP2 from exon 4. Only a single fragment of 300 bp was\namplified that corresponded to the mature mRNA lack-\ning introns 1, 2 and 3 (Figure 1E, lane 2). Notwithstand-\ning, when primers PM1 at the beginning of intron 3 and\nprimer P2 from exon 4 were used for PCR, two bands of\nabout 200 and 900 bp, respectively, were amplified (Fig-\nure 1E, lane 1). Negative controls for all these PCR reac-\ntions produced no amplicons (see Materials and\nSarno et al.

To confirm this expec-\ntation, a Southern-blot with the RT-PCR products of the\ntwo PCR reactions shown in Figure 1E was carried out\nusing a probe corresponding to intron 3 (see Materials\nand Methods). Only the 900 bp band - not the small 200\nbp band - in lane 1 showed positive hybridisation. The\n300 bp band in lane 2 did not hybridise as expected since\nthis corresponds to an mRNA lacking intron 3 (Figure\n1F). Collectively, these results indicate that the mRNA\nisoform retaining intron 3 in the male germ line of A.\nobliqua i s  v e r y  p o o r l y  r e p r e s e n t e d ,  i n  c o n t r a s t  t o  t h a t\nseen in Drosophila and in agreement with which occurs\nin C. capitata [23] and Musca domestica [29].\nThe Tra2 protein of A. obliqua and other Anastrepha \nspecies\nThe conceptual translation of the female Aotra2 mRNA\nshowed it to encode a polypeptide of 249 amino acids. It\nshared the main structural features that characterise the\nSR protein family, i.e., the RNA-binding motif (RRM) and\ntwo RS-domains, which are rich in serine-arginine dipep-\ntides and confer upon these proteins the capacity to inter-\nact with others.\nTo characterise the Tra2 protein of other Anastrepha\nspecies, it was assumed that the tra-2 gene of the Anas-\ntrepha species studied here had a molecular organisation\nsimilar to that of A. obliqua. Under this assumption, RT-\nPCR analyses of total RNA from female adults were per-\nformed. Reverse transcription was performed with the P4\nprimer located in the 3'UTR region of Aotra2. PCR\namplification of the cDNA was undertaken using the pair\nof primers P5 (from the 5'UTR of Aotra2) plus P4 (see\nFigure 1A). In this way the whole ORF of the tra-2 gene of\nall Anastrepha species studied here was amplified, cloned\nand sequenced. The Tra2 protein of all these Anastrepha\nspecies was composed of 249 amino acids. Their degree\nof similarity (i.e., identical plus conserved amino acids)\nwas extremely high, ranging from 97.2 to 100% (see addi-\ntional File 2).\nThe putative Tra2 protein from A. obliqua (used as the\nreference species), those from the dipterans C. capitata ,\nB. oleae , M. domestica, L. cuprina, D. melanogaster, D.\nvirilis and D. pesudoobscura, that from the lepidopteran\nBombyx mori (the silkworm) and from the hymenopteran\nApis mellifera (the honeybee), and the Tra2-like protein\nfrom the jewel wasp Nasonnia vitripennis\n(Hymenoptera), were then compared (see additional File\n3). The number of amino acids composing these Tra2\nproteins varied: the C. capitata and B. oleae had 251\namino acids, M. domestica 232, L. cuprina 271, D. mela-\nnogaster, D. virilis and D. pseudoobscura 264, 315 and 248\nrespectively, B. mori 284, A. mellifera 269, and the N. vit-\nripennis Tra2-like protein 307. These differences are due\nto changes throughout the Tra2 protein except in the\nRRM domain, which has the same number of amino acids\nin all these species.\nSimilarity was higher among the dipteran Tra2 proteins\nthan between these and the lepipdopteran and\nhymenopteran Tra2 proteins. The greatest degree of sim-\nilarity was seen between the tephritid Anastrepha, Cera-\ntitis and Bactrocera Tra2 proteins (83.9 - 86.3%), and\nbetween these and those of the Lucilia (57.4 - 58.9%),\nMusca (48.3 - 57.7%), Drosophila (36.7% - 49.6%) Apis\n(58.7%) and Bombyx (48.2%) representatives.\nThe gene tra-2 is required for sex determination in \nAnastrepha\nOutside Drosophila, the function of tra-2 in sex determi-\nnation has been unambiguously demonstrated in M.\ndomestica [29] and in C. capitata [23] using RNAi proce-\ndures. The injection of the Musca and Ceratitis tra-2\ndsRNA into their respective embryos, transformed XX\nflies into pseudomales. This methodology was used to\ntest the requirement of tra-2 for sex determination in\nAnastrepha. An imperative of this technique is to have\nmarkers that allow one to determine whether male survi-\nvors really do c orrespond to XX females that ha ve been\ntransformed into pseudomales by destruction of the\nendogenous tra-2 gene function, or normal XY males. No\nY chromosome molecular markers have yet been identi-\nfied for Anastrepha flies. Therefore, to ascertain the chro-\nmosome constitution of the XX pseudomales,\nchromosome squashes from the testis of the adults were\nprepared. The X and the Y chromosome of A. obliqua are\nnot easily distinguished [35], whereas those of A. sp.1 aff.\nfraterculus can be clearly separated one from another [25]\nas shown in Figure 2A-C. Hence, embryos of this latter\nspecies were used as hosts for the injection of Aotra2\ndsRNA since the tra-2 gene of A. obliqua and that of A.\nsp.1 aff. fraterculus have a very high degree of similarity\n(see additional Files 3 and 4) (for details of the injection\nprocedure and the analysis of chromosomes see Materials\nand Methods).\nOf the 1450 A. sp.1 embryos experimentally injected\nwith Aotra2 dsRNA, 86 reached the adult stage, and of\nthese 76 were males and 10 were females. However,\nFigure 2 Chromosomes of A. sp.1 aff. fraterculus.

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:140\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/140\nPage 6 of 14\namong the 1000 control injected embryos, 44 survived to\nadulthood, 21 being males and 23 females. The sex ratio\nbias associated with the experimental injection cannot be\nexplained by a higher sensitivity of the female embryos to\nthe injection procedure causing their death. Rather, it\nsuggests a transformation of XX female embryos into XX\npseudomales caused by a destruction of the endogenous\ntra-2 function. Testis squashes were prepared for the 76\nexperimental male survivors; 58 showed cell divisions\nand the chromosomes were unambiguously identified,\nshowing there to be 47 XY males and 11 XX\npseudomales. All these pseudomales showed normal\nmale external terminalia (data not shown). However, after\ndissection, some of them showed male and female inter-\nnal genital structures (Figure 3A-C). Others pseudomales\nhad aberrant gonads such as underdeveloped testes, or a\nwell-developed testis plus a poorly developed testis (Fig-\nure 3E, F). It was expected that these XX pseudomales\nwould show a change in the splicing pattern of both\nendogenous tra and dsx pre-mRNAs. This was confirmed\nb y  R T - P C R  a s s a y s  o n  t o t a l  R N A  f r o m  t h e  X X\npseudomales, from which the gonads were removed.\nThe gene tra of the Anastrepha species is transcribed in\nboth sexes during development and in adult life, but its\nprimary transcript follows alternative splicing routes: the\nmale-exons, which are incorporated into mature mRNA\nin males are spliced out in females. It encodes three\nfemale mRNAs that differ in the length of the 3'-UTR\ndepending on the poly-A(+) signal used, and five different\nisoforms of male mRNA depending on the male-specific\nexons included [18]. To analyse the splicing pattern of the\nendogenous tra pre-mRNA, the pair of primers TraAo41\nand TraAo44 were used; these are located in common\nexons 1 and 2, respectively, which flank the male-specific\nexons (Figure 4A). Figure 4A shows that in the\npseudomales the amplicons corresponding to the male\ntra mRNA isoform were generated (traces of the female\ntra mRNA were present in pseudomale #4). Negative\ncontrols in all these PCR reactions produced no ampli-\ncons (see Materials and Methods). These results indicate\nthat the destruction of the endogenous tra-2 function\ncauses a change in the splicing pattern of the endogenous\ntra pre-mRNA from the female mode into the male one.\nConsequently, the Tra2 protein is required for sex deter-\nmination in Anastrepha through its participation in the\nfemale-specific splicing of tra pre-mRNA.\nThe gene dsx of Anastrepha codes for male-and female-\nspecific RNAs, which encode the male-specific DsxM\nand female-specific DsxF proteins [20,21]. The presence\nof putative Tra-Tra2 binding sites in the female-specific\nexon of dsx suggests suggest that, as in Drosophila, male-\nspecific splicing represents the default mode and that\nFigure 4 Analyses of the splicing pattern of tra (A) and dsx (B) pre-\nmRNAs of A. sp.1 aff. fraterculus in XX pseudomales developed \nfrom eggs injected with Aotra2 dsRNA.

While\nin pseudomale #1 the transcript was barely visible, in\npseudomales #2 and 3, the amount was almost similar\nrelatively to the corresponding dsxM RNA. Negative con-\ntrols in all these PCR reactions produced no amplicons\n(see Materials and Methods). These results indicate that\nthe Tra2 protein is needed for the female-specific splicing\nof dsx pre-mRNA in Anastrepha.\nPhylogeny and molecular evolution of gene tra-2\nThe Tra2 protein sequences determined for different\nAnastrepha species were aligned with homologous\nsequences from other tephritids and representative\ninsects in order to reconstruct the evolutionary relation-\nships of this protein in Diptera (see additional File 4),\nusing the Tra2 sequences from B. mori (Lepidoptera), A.\nmellifera and N. vitripennis (Hymenoptera) as outgroups.\nThe topology obtained for the Tra2 protein phylogeny\nshown in Figure 5A shows high confidence levels in the\ngroups defined. In the phylogenetic tree, the Tra2 pro-\nteins of the Nasonia, Apis and Bombix representatives\nclustered in a basal clade and the dipteran species in\nanother. Within the latter, Drosophila species were found\nin one branch and the other dipterans in another. Musca\nand Lucilia clustered in a subgroup and the species of\nTephritidae in another. Among the tephritids, Bactrocera\nand Ceratitis clustered into one subgroup on the same\nbranch, while the Anastrepha species clustered into a dif-\nferent subgroup of that same branch.\nThe Tra2 protein from the Anastrepha species appears\nto be closely related to Tra2 from other tephritids, such as\nCeratitis and Bactrocera, as well as to Musca and Lucilia,\nshowing a monophyletic origin. The Tra2 proteins of the\nDrosophila representatives, however, show substantial\ndivergence.\nThe variation presented both at the nucleotide and\namino acid levels of the tra-2 gene in Diptera was studied\nin the present work by discriminating between the differ-\nent functional domains of Tra2 protein: the RRM, RS N-\nterminal (RS1) and RS C-terminal (RS2) domains and the\nlinker region. The overall amino acid and nucleotide vari-\nation were 0.236 ± 0.011 and 0.359 ± 0.021 substitutions\nper site, respectively, are given in additional File 5. The\nnature of this nucleotide variation was essentially synony-\nmous, being significantly greater than the non-synony-\nmous variation in all cases except for the N-terminal RS1\ndomain of the protein. The overall variation obtained in\nDiptera was substantially higher than that seen for the\ntephritids, which showed a high degree of protein conser-\nvation among themselves (0.048 ± 0.007 amino acid sub-\nstitutions per site and 0.081 ± 0.006 nucleotide\nsubstitutions per site). In the tephritids - as for the dipter-\nans - the level of synonymous variation was significantly\ngreater than that of non-synonymous variation. Compar-\nisons between the extent of synonymous and non-synon-\nymous variation revealed significant differences in all\ncases ( Z-test, P < 0.001; see additional File 5) with the\nexception of the N-terminal RS1 domain of Tra2, point-\ning towards the presence of negative selection acting at\nthe protein level in order to maintain Tra2 structural fea-\ntures, especially with respect to the RRM domain.\nA higher degree of protein and nucleotide sequence\nconservation in the Tra2 protein was evident in the\nregion corresponding to the RRM motif as well as in the\nli nk er r egion (adjac en t to  RRM), in c on trast t o t he high\ndegree of variation presented by the RS1 and RS2\ndomains. The nucleotide variation across the tra-2 gene\nis detailed in the graph shown in Figure 5B. A valley in\nthe region corresponding to the RRM and linker regions\nwere observed concomitantly with a reduction in non-\nsynonymous substitutions, emphasizing the critical role\nplayed by this RRM domain in Tra2 function.\nDiscussion\nIn this work, Aotra2 was characterised and found to pro-\nduce a single mRNA in both sexes that encoded a 249\namino acid-long protein with the features of the SR pro-\ntein family. In contrast to that seen in Drosophila, no sig-\nnificant partially spliced mRNA isoform specific to the\nmale germ line was detected. The observed mRNA is\ntranscribed in both sexes during development and in\nadult life in both the soma and germ line. The injection of\nAotra-2 dsRNA into Anastrepha embryos caused a\nchange in the splicing pattern of the endogenous tra and\ndsx p r e - m R N A s  o f  X X  f e m a l e s  f r o m  t h e  f e m a l e  t o  t h e\nmale mode. Consequently, these XX females showed\ntransformation into pseudomales.\nThe recover of XX pseudomales composed of a mixture\nof male and female structures in the internal genitalia\nindicates that the transformation of females induced by\nthe Aotra-2 dsRNA was partial. This result is in line to\nobservations of partial transformation induced by RNAi\nof the gene tra of C. capitata [16], of B. oleae [17], of L.\ncuprina [30] and of M. domestica [36], and the partial\ntransformation induced by RNAi of the gene tra-2 of M.\ndomestica [29] and of C. capitata [23], in which some\npseudomales had, e.g. male external genitalia but female\nstructures in the anterior regions of the body.

Based on the results found in C. capitata, B. oleae, L.\ncuprina and M. domestica above mentioned, it is\nexpected that in A. sp.1 the extent of the sexual transfor-\nmation was also variable among the pseudomales; i.e.\nalthough these were identified as males by inspection of\nthe external terminalia, other structures of the fly could\nremain female if the injected dsRNA did not reach their\ncellular precursors. This would explain the fact that the\nanalysed A. sp.1 XX pseudomales showed traF and dsxF\nFigure 5 Molecular evolution of Tra2 proteins.

These results indicate that the Tra2 protein\nis needed for sex determination in Anastrepha. \nFinally, the Tra2 proteins of ten other Anastrepha spe-\ncies were characterised and compared among themselves\nand with the Tra2 protein of other insects in which it has\nbeen characterised. The Tra2 protein from the Anas-\ntrepha species was closely related to the Tra2 from other\ntephritids, such as Ceratitis and Bactrocera, as well as to\nother dipterans such as Musca and Lucilia, showing a\nmonophyletic origin. However, the Tra2 protein of Droso-\nphila showed substantial divergence. The nature of the\nnucleotide variation in tra-2 was essentially synonymous\n(significantly more common than non-synonymous vari-\nation). This suggests the existence of negative selection\nacting at the protein level in order to maintain Tra2 struc-\ntural features, especially with respect to the RRM\ndomain.\nFunction of tra-2 in Anastrepha sex determination\nIn the tephritids C. capitata [16] and B. oleae [17], and in\ntwelve Anastrepha species [18], the gene tra acts as the\nmemory device for sex determination via its auto-regula-\ntory function, i.e., through the contribution of the Tra\nprotein to the female-specific splicing of its own pre-\nmRNA [16,17]. Further, the tra-2 of C. capitata is needed\nfor the female-specific splicing of tra and dsx pre-mRNAs\n[23]. This requires the formation of a complex with the\nTra protein, which then interacts with the Tra-Tra2 bind-\ning sites present in both pre-mRNAs [16,19]. This role for\ntra-2 in sex determination also exists in Anastrepha spe-\ncies (present work).\nThe maternal expression of tra [16-18] and tra-2 ([23];\npresent work) in tephritids supplies the embryo with\nmaternal Tra-Tra2 complex. This is essential for impos-\ning female-specific splicing of the initial zygotic tra pre-\nmRNA so that the first zygotic functional Tra protein is\nproduced and tra auto-regulation can be established. In\nthis scenario the XX embryos follow female development.\nIn XY embryos, however, the yet non-characterised M\nfactor present in the Y chromosome would prevent the\ntra auto-regulation system being set up. Consequently,\nthese embryos would not produce functional Tra protein\nand develop as males [16] (see Figure 6). The existence of\nan M factor in the Y chromosome has been demonstrated\nonly in C. capitata [38]. However, the analysis of tra in\nBactrocera [17] and tra [18] and tra-2 (present work) in\nAnastrepha species suggests their Y chromosome have a\nsimilar function.\nBoth the tephritid Tra and Tra2 protein show a dual\nsplicing role in sex determination. On one hand both\nbehave as a splicing activator of dsx pre-mRNA: the bind-\ning of Tra-Tra2 to the female-specific exon promotes the\ninclusion of this exon into the mature mRNA. On the\nother hand, Tra and Tra2 act as splicing inhibitors of tra\npre-mRNA: the binding of Tra-Tra2 to the male-specific\nexons prevents the inclusion of these exons into the\nmature mRNA. It has been proposed that the Tra2-ISS\nbinding sites, which have been found in the splicing regu-\nlatory region of the tra pre-mRNA of the tephritids, but\nnot in dsx pre-mRNA, provide the distinguishing marker\nfor the dual splicing function of the Tra-Tra2 complex in\ntephritids [18].\nThis role of genes tra and tra-2 in sex determination is\nnot exclusive to tephritid insects (Diptera, Tephritidae)\nsince the homologous genes in L. cuprina (Diptera, Calli-\nphoridae) seem to play the same role [30]. A similar situa-\ntion is found in the housefly M. domestica (Diptera,\nMuscidae), where the gene F plays the key role for female\nsex determination. The maternal product is needed to\nactivate the zygotic function of F, which appears to show\nauto-regulation [39]. Recently, the molecular characteri-\nsation of F revealed it to be the orthologue of tra in the\nhousefly [36]. tra-2 is also required for this auto-regula-\ntion in this species [29]. The existence of an M factor in\nthe Y chromosome has been also demonstrated in Lucilia\n[40] and in Musca [41-43], though in this latter species,\nsome strains carry the M factor in an autosome [44].

Though the maternal expression of gene tra-2 in Lu-\ncilia and the characterisation of this gene in Bactrocera have not been \nreported, both species are included in the scheme of this Figure be-\ncause the analysis of tra in Bactrocera [17] and the analysis of tra and \ntra-2 in Lucilia [30] suggests their tra-2 genes have a similar function as \nin Ceratitis, Anastrepha and Musca.

It has been sug-\ngested [18] that the tra/tra2 > dsx elements at the bottom\nof the cascade, and their relationships, likely represent\nthe ancestral state (which still exists in the Tephritidae,\nCalliphoridae and Muscidae lineages) of the extant cas-\ncade found in the Drosophilidae lineage (in which tra is\njust another component of the sex determination gene\ncascade regulated by Sxl). Thus, in the phylogenetic lin-\neage that gave rise to the drosophilids, evolution co-opted\nfor the Sxl gene, modified it, and converted it into the key\ngene controlling sex determination.\nIn Drosophila, the gene tra-2 also shows a dual splicing\nrole. It behaves as a splicing activator of dsx pre-mRNA in\nthe soma of Drosophila females, but also acts as a splicing\ninhibitor of the M1 intron in tra-2 pre-mRNA in the\ngerm line of Drosophila males (see Figure 1C). The pres-\nence of M1 in the mature tra-2 mRNA prevents the for-\nmation of full, functional Tra2 protein [32]. It has been\nfound that Drosophila somatic cells are also able to pre-\nvent splicing of the M1 intron whenever levels of Tra2\nprotein are above normal [47]. The tra-2 promoter of the\nmale-germ line is more active than the tra-2 promoter of\nthe somatic tissues of Drosophila [27,28,47]. Regulated\nlevels of Tra2 protein are therefore required since an\nexcess of the Tra2 protein causes male sterility [33] and\nreduces the viability of Drosophila males and females\n[47].\nThe gene tra-2 produces a single mRNA in both sexes\nand no significant partially spliced mRNA isoform spe-\ncific to the male germ line has been detected in Ceratitis\n[23], Musca [29], Lucilia [30] or Anastrepha (present\nwork). Hence, it is here postulated that the promoter of\nthis gene in the male germ line of these dipteran insects\nbehaves in a fashion similar to that seen in the somatic\ntissues. The splicing inhibitor function of tra-2 observed\nin the Drosophila male germ line was probably acquired\nduring the evolutionary lineage that gave rise to the dros-\nophilids and may constitute an evolutionary solution for\nits high expression in this tissue and the return to normal\nlevels of Tra2 protein. This protein belongs to the SR pro-\ntein family, the members of which are involved in splicing\nregulation, mRNA transport and mRNA translation [48].\nIts level in the cell must therefore be regulated if these\nprocesses are not to be impaired.\nThe molecular evolution of Tra2\nThe analysis of Tra2 relationships among the studied spe-\ncies resulted in a statistically well supported phylogenetic\ntree. In this tree, the Tephritidae species, which belong to\nthe subgroup Acalyptratae of the suborder Brachycera,\nwere more closely related to Musca and Lucilia, which\nbelong to the Calyptratae subgroup of the suborder\nBrachycera, than to Drosophila species, which also\nbelong to the subgroup Acalyptratae. These findings are\nin line with previous analyses of genes involved in sex\ndetermination, e.g., Sxl [49], tra [30] and tra-2 [22,30].\nHowever, the analysis of dsx indicates a distinct relation-\nship, i.e., Dsx proteins from the Tephritidae are more\nclosely related to Drosophila than to Musca [21]. This dis-\ncrepancy might be explained by the position of the genes\ndsx, tra and tra-2 in the sex determination cascade. The\ngene dsx is the more basal gene in this cascade, whereas\nthe other genes would have been co-opted for sex deter-\nmination over evolutionary time; thus, a higher degree of\nconservation can be expected for dsx than for tra or tra-2\n[45]. The gene dsx encodes for transcription factors that\ncontrol the sexual cytodifferentiation genes; dsx is there-\nfore subject to strong purifying selection to maintain this\ncontrol. The Tra and Tra2 proteins belong to the SR fam-\nily of proteins involved in splicing, which are character-\nised by having repetitions of the serine-arginine\ndipeptide. Variation in the content of RS dipeptides\nseems to be a feature of the SR proteins whenever they\nhave maintained enough such dipeptides to preserve\ntheir function [50].\nThe overall amino acid variation of Tra2 (present work)\nis significantly smaller than that previously reported for\nTra [18]. The low rates of evolution shown by Tra2 in\ntephritids are also in agreement with the low rates of evo-\nlution reported for Tra in this group, and in stark contrast\nwith the high rates of neutral evolution reported in some\nDrosophila species [50,51].\nThe extent of synonymous and non-synonymous nucle-\notide variation in the Tra2 proteins suggests the presence\nof extensive silent divergence. This, together with the\nstrict conservation of the distribution of the RS-rich and\nRRM domains, suggests that tra-2 is subject to strong\npurifying selection to preserve the mechanism of action\nof Tra2 proteins. A higher degree of conservation was\nevident in the RRM and linker regions, in contrast to the\ndiversity shown by the RS-rich regions. In fact, the RRM-\nlinker junction region is considered a signature motif of\nTra2 proteins [52].\nThe Tra protein seems to lack an RNA binding domain;\nthus, its influence in splicing regulation is exerted at the\nlevel of its interaction (through the RS domains) with\nother proteins carrying RNA-binding domains, such as\nTra2 (reviewed in [53]). The variation in the number of\nRS dipeptides in the RS1 and RS2 regions of the Tra2 pro-\nteins parallels the situation found in the Tra proteins,\nwhich appear to undergo high rates of neutral evolution\n[50,51]. The high degree of conservation in the RRM\ndomain of the Tra2 proteins studied here agrees with its\nSarno et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:140\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/140\nPage 11 of 14\nfundamental role in the function of the Tra-Tra2 com-\nplex; this domain confers upon the complex its capacity\nto specifically interact with the tra and dsx pre-mRNAs\nand thus regulate its sex-specific splicing.\nThe high degree of divergence between the Anastrepha\nand the Drosophila Tra2 proteins is of particular interest.\nThis divergence was mainly observed in the RS domains,\nwhich are involved in protein-protein interactions. This\nobservation agrees with the experimental observation\nthat the Anastrepha Tra-Drosophila Tra2 complex\nappears to be less efficient than the Drosophila Tra-Tra2\ncomplex at inducing female-specific splicing of the Dros-\nophila dsx pre-mRNA [54]. Hence, the interaction\nbetween the Anastrepha Tra protein and the Drosophila\nTra2 protein might be impeded as a consequence of\nchanges accumulated in these proteins after the Anas-\ntrepha and Drosophila phylogenetic lineages separated.\nThese results suggest that Tra and Tra2 proteins co-\nevolved to exert their function in sex determination.\nConclusions\nThe gene transformer-2 is required for sex determination\nin Anastrepha through its participation in the female-\nspecific splicing of transformer and doublesex pre-\nmRNAs. It is therefore needed for the auto-regulation of\nthe gene transformer. Thus, the transformer/transfomer-2\n> doublesex elements at the bottom of the cascade, and\ntheir relationships, probably represent the ancestral state\n(which still exists in the Tephritidae, Calliphoridae and\nMuscidae lineages) of the extant cascade found in the\nDrosophilidae lineage (in which tra is just another com-\nponent of the sex determination gene cascade regulated\nby Sex-lethal). The extent of synonymous and non-syn-\nonymous nucleotide variation in the Tra2 proteins sug-\ngests the presence of extensive silent divergence. This,\ntogether with the strict conservation of the distribution\nof the RS-rich and RRM domains, suggests that tra-2 is\nsubject to strong purifying selection to preserve the\nmechanism of action of Tra2 proteins.\nMethods\nSpecies\nThe species of Anastrepha studied, their host fruits, and\nthe sites where they were collected are described in Ruiz\net al. [21]. Rearing conditions were 23 ± 2°C, relative\nhumidity 60-80%, light intensity 4000-5000 lux, photope-\nriod 12:12 h (L:D).\nMolecular analyses\nGenomic DNA was extracted from frozen specimens as\ndescribed in Maniatis et al. [55]. Total RNA from adult\nfemale ovaries, adult male testis, embryos, larvae, and\nadult male and female somatic cells was prepared using\nthe Ultraspec-II RNA isolation kit (Biotecx) following the\nmanufacturer's instructions. Five micrograms of total\nRNA from each sample were reversed transcribed with\nSuperscript (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's\ninstructions. Reverse transcription reactions were per-\nformed with an oligo-dT. Two percent of the synthesised\ncDNA was amplified by PCR. All amplicons were analy-\nsed by electrophoresis in agarose gels, cloned using the\nTOPO TA-cloning kit (Invitrogen) following the manu-\nfacturer's instructions and sequenced. In all cases, PCR\nreactions with RNA samples were performed to guaran-\ntee that they were not contaminated with genomic DNA\n(negative controls of PCR reactions).\nThe GenomeWalker genomic library of A. obliqua was\nsynthesised using the BD GenomeWalker Universal kit\n(BD Biosciences), following the manufacturer's instruc-\ntions.\nSouthern-blotting (see Figure 1F) was performed by\ntransferring the RT-PCR products shown in Figure 1E\nonto a nylon membrane (Zeta-Probe Blotting Mem-\nbranes BIO RAD). The probe used corresponds to a frag-\nment of 630 nucleotides of the A. obliqua tra-2 gene,\nobtained by PCR involving genomic DNA and using the\npair of primers PM1 and PM2 located at the 5' and 3' ends\nof intron 3 respectively (see Figure 1A). The probe was\nlabelled with digoxigenin using the PCR DIG Labeling\nMix kit (Roche) and hybridisation was detected with the\nDIG luminescent Detection Kit for Nucleic Acids (Roche)\nfollowing the manufacturer's instructions.\nDNA sequencing and sequence analysis\nSequencing was performed using an automated 377 DNA\nsequencer (Applied Biosystems). The analysis of\nsequences was performed by using the BLASTX pro-\ngramme.\nInjection of Aotra2 dsRNA into Anastrepha embryos\nThe tra2 dsRNA was prepared as described for Droso-\nphila [56]. The complete ORF of Aotra2 cloned in the\npUAST plasmid was used as a template in a PCR reaction\nwith the primer pair P1T7 and P3T3 (corresponding to\nprimers P1 and P3) (see Figure 1A), flanked by a T7 pro-\nmoter sequences at their 5' ends. The amplicon of this\nPCR was used as template to produce the tra2 dsRNA in\nan in vitro transcription reaction with T7 RNA poly-\nmerase using the Megascript kit (Ambion). This dsRNA\nwas precipitated with ethanol and resuspended in the\ninjection buffer [57].\nHemispheres made of 3% agar stained with red com-\nmercial food dye (aniline) and wrapped in parafilm\n® where\nfurnished for oviposition [25], and eggs for injection\nrecovered after 2 h. These were injected into the adjacent\nanterior region of the posterior pole with either 8 μM\nAotra2 dsRNA (experimental embryos) or injection buf-\nfer (control embryos), following the described procedures\nSarno et al.

The injected embryos\nwere then transplanted into host fruit where they devel-\noped until reaching the pupal stage. The pupae were col-\nlected and transferred to population cages until the\nemergence of the adults. Newborn males (2-4 days old)\nwere examined to record their external terminalia (exter-\nnal genitalia plus analia), which is the only external sexual\ndimorphic structure found in Anastrepha species [37],\nand then dissected for analysis of the internal genital\nstructures and the removal of the testes for the determi-\nnation of their chromosomal constitution.\nPreparation of chromosome squashes\nChromosome squashes of testes from the Anastrepha\nmales were prepared as previously described [58,59].\nSequences of the primers used in this work\nMar17: 5' GTRTGIGSIVGYTKNGTDATNGA 3';\nMar26: 5' MGIAGYCGNGGNTTYTGYTTY 3';\nTra2B: 5' NCKRTCRTCDATYTCCATNCC 3';\nP1: 5' AGAGTTGGAATGAGTCCACG 3';\nP2: 5' CACGTCGCTTATCGTATGGA 3';\nP3: 5' CATATTTTTAATAGCGCGTACG 3';\nP4: 5' ATTACCAAGGTGTGGGCTTC 3';\nP5: 5' AGTGAAATCCAGTTGATACGC 3';\nGW1: 5' TATCAGGATATAGCCGATGCTAAGGC 3';\nGW2: 5' CAAGCGTCTTTAGCTGCCTTAGCATC 3';\nPM1: 5' TACGAACGCAGCTTACTTCC 3';\nPM2: 5' CTTGCGGTTCTGAGACTGAC 3'.\nP1T7: 5' TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGACTA-\nGAGTTGGAATGAGTCCACG 3'\nP3T3: 5' TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGACTCATAT\nTTTTAATAGCGCGTACG 3'\nThe Mar17 primer is described in Burghardt et al.

Multiple sequence alignments\nwere conducted on the basis of the translated amino acid\nsequences and edited for potential errors over 1089\nnucleotide sites corresponding to 363 amino acid posi-\ntions using BIOEDIT [60] and CLUSTAL W [61] soft-\nware. The different domains in the Tra2 protein were\ndefined according to Salvemini et al. [23] as: the RS-rich\nN-terminal region (19-459), the RNA recognition motif-\nRRM (502-717), the linker region (718-774), and the RS-\nrich C-terminal region (775-1077).\nMolecular evolutionary analyses were performed using\nMEGA v.4 software [62]. The extent of nucleotide\nsequence divergence was estimated by means of the\nKimura 2-parameter method [63] and the amino acid\nsequence divergence estimated by means of the uncor-\nrected differences ( p-distances). This approach is known\nto give good results, especially for distantly related taxa\n[64]. The number of synonymous ( p\nS) and non-synony-\nmous (pN) nucleotide differences per site were calculated\nusing the modified method of Nei-Gojobori [65], provid-\ning the transition/transversion ratio (R) for each case.\nEvolutionary distances were calculated using the compete\ndeletion option. Standard errors of the estimates were\ncalculated using the bootstrap method (1000 replicates).\nPhylogenetic trees were reconstructed using the neigh-\nbour-joining tree-building method [66]. However, maxi-\nmum parsimony trees were also inferred to ensure that\nthe obtained results were not dependent on this choice.\nThe reliability of the resulting topologies was tested by\nthe bootstrap method [67] and by the interior-branch test\n[68], producing the bootstrap probability (BP) and confi-\ndence probability (CP) values for each interior branch in\nthe tree respectively. Given that the bootstrap method is\nknown to be conservative, a BP > 80% was interpreted as\nhigh statistical support for groups, whereas a CP ≥ 95%\nwas considered statistically significant [69]. Phylogenies\nwere rooted using the tra-2 gene of Lepidoptera and\nHymenoptera.\nThe analysis of the nucleotide variation across coding\nregions was performed using the sliding-window\napproach afforded by DnaSP v.5 software [70], estimating\nthe proportion ( p)  o f  n u c l e o t i d e  s i t e s  a t  w h i c h  t w o\nsequences being compared were different, and the ratio\nbetween the numbers of non-synonymous ( p\nN) and syn-\nonymous (pS) substitutions per site, employing a window\nlength of 25 nucleotides and a step size of 5 nucleotides.\nAdditional material\nAdditional file 1 Number of nucleotides that compose the exons and \nintrons of gene tra-2 of A. obliqua, C. capitata and D. melanogaster. \nExons (boxes) and introns (lines) are not drawn to scale.\nSarno et al.
