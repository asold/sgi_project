Introduction \nPower transformers are the most expensive and important equipment in electric power \nsystems that serves to convert the power with different level of voltage. During its lifetime, \ntransformer insulation is exposed to mainly el ectrical, mechanical and thermal stresses. \nTherefore, the life of a transf ormer depends mainly on the condition of the insulation and its \nability to withstand the above stresses, during its normal operation. The main reason behind the \nstresses can be due to aging of insulation and the mo st critical reason is a short circuit event. \nAs the health of the oil implies the health of  the transformer, the oil should be sampled and \ntested regularly to evaluate the oil condition and to determine the possible fault problems [1, 2]. \nTherefore, incipient fault detection of transform ers is necessary in order to avoid electrical \npower system fault as quickly as possible. \nThe transformer insulation can be classified into mineral oil and solid insulation [3, 4]. \nAny weakness of insulation may re sult in failure of the transfo rmer [5]. Insulating oil in a \ntransformer during operation is exposed to a combination of heat, oxygen and electrical \ndischarge, which may lead to its degradation especially through the process of oxidation [6-8]. \nWhen an incipient fault occurs in power transfor mer, either electrical or thermal, causing \ndecomposition of the transformer oil and a num ber of gases are generated and dissolved into \nthe oil. Such these gases are mainly incl ude Hydrogen (H2), methane (CH4), Ethane (C2H4), \nEthylene (CH6), acetylene (C2H2), carbon monox ide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) and the \nnon-fault gases are nitrogen (N2), oxygen (O2). Transformer oil can decompose CO and CO2 \nas a result of its oxidation [8].  \nDissolved gas analysis (DGA) is one of the most acceptable techniques used for \ndetecting and evaluating gasses dissolved from mi neral oil and also from solid insulation of \ninternal incipient faults in the power transformer based on the oil samples [9, 10]. It is critically \nimportant to monitor the incipient of transformer fault depending on the type and the \nconcentrations of these gases formation. DGA interpretation techniques such as Key gas \ntechnique, Doernenbug technique, Roger ratio technique, IEC ratios technique, and Duval \n                     ISSN: 2302-4046 \n           \n TELKOMNIKA Vol. 16, No. 3, December 2015 :  409 – 416 \n410\ntriangle technique [8], [11-14] are different techni ques for the detection of incipient transformer \nfault conditions.  \nIn this paper, the dissolved gasses were interpreted using several techniques. Different \ntechniques give different analysis result, and it is faced with so much diverse information. These \ntechniques of interpretation of the fault gases are investigated. The study was done to evaluate \nthe accuracy of each technique in predictin g the fault based on a fault percentage using \nMATLAB program. \n \n \n2. Samples of Evaluated Transformers   \nThe evaluation is carried out on DGA data obtained from 352 oil samples has been \nsummarized  into 46 samples  that have been collected from a 38 different transformers of \ndifferent rating and different life spans as given in  Table 1. It is difficult to determine whether a \ntransformer is behaving normally if it has no pr evious dissolved gas history. For analyzing the \naging degree of the transformer for normal state, we can classify the normal condition as a four \nstatus conditions such as: Normal Operat ion, Caution (investigate), Abnormal (more \ninvestigation), and Danger (nearing failure). The DGA guide to classify risks to transformers with \nno previous problems has been developed by the IEEE [5, 13]. It uses combinations of \nindividual gases and total combustible gas concentration. This guide is not universally accepted \nand only one of the tools is used to evaluate transformers. \n \n \nTable 1. Transformer details  \nTransf.

Therefore, for the \nfault identification with respect to each traditional technique, the faults are categorized into \nseven types of faults which is assigned with fault codes F1-F7 as suggested in Table 4. The \nnext step is to compare all incipient fault types  using each technique. Then, the conclusion is \ngiven for final fault type of the tested transformer oil same sample unit based on the percentage \ngiven by each techinque.

To avoid this in the \ndeveloped proposed tec hnique, the output will be sele cted based on the worst case. \nConsequently, based on MATLAB Code the above analysis is summarized in table 5. The \ninternal incipient faults diagnosis of power tran sformer is also accomplished by evaluation of \ntransformer condition using individual and TDCG  concentrations for determining the overall \nhealth of a power transformer based on four stat us conditions: Normal Operation, Caution, \nAbnormal, and Danger (nearing failure). So, the resu lt of this work is useful for planning an \nappropriate maintenance strategy to keep th e power transformer in acceptable conditions. \nTherefore, incipient fault detection of transform ers is necessary in order to avoid electrical \npower system fault as quickly as possible. \n \n \n5. Conclusion \nThis paper introduces an accurate DGA technique for identifying the internal incipient \nfaults in the power transformer based on the fault percentage of dissolved gasses released from \ntransformer oil and solid insulation using practical oil samples collected from different \ntransformers. The techniques of interpretation of the fault gases are investigated and compared \nwith each other based on the Accurate DGA  technique which is derived from individual \ntechniques to evaluate the accuracy of each technique in predicting the fault based on a \nMATLAB program as shown in Table 5. Furthermo re, the deteriorated transformer by means of \nthis analysis can be carefully focused for t he appropriate maintenance as condition-based \nmaintenance before severe damage occurs. \n                     ISSN: 2302-4046 \n           \n TELKOMNIKA Vol. 16, No. 3, December 2015 :  409 – 416 \n416\nReferences \n[1] A Abu-Siada, S Islam.
