The report reflects the promising solutions for the creation of \nadaptive protection means and emergency automatics in the \nimplementation of methods of identification of dynamic systems. \nPresented original research assigned at directly addressing the causes of the \nsensitivity lack of the transformer equipment protection – compensation \nfor the magnetizing current of the power transformers by linearizing their \ntransfer characteristics. \n1 The problem of identification of mathematical models \nparameters of power equipment \nMost of the numerical and analytical methods, used in practice for studying transients of \nelectrical power equipment, are based on the use of its idealized (conservative) \nmathematical description and, as a result of this, inadequately reflect the r eal dynamic \ncharacteristics of the interconnected power systems. Initially, this caused by the \nmethodological error due to the insufficient mathematical rigor of the formulation of the \nresearch problem, and in some cases in using of unreliable primary (ini tial) parameters of \nthe mathematical model during the performance of numerical experiments. All this \ninevitably causes errors in solving the problem when performing computational studies and \ncan lead to subsequent misinterpretation of the obtained results,  which is ultimately \nreflected in the erroneous view of the operation reliability and stability of the power system  \n[1-17]. \nAs a rule, the idealization of mathematical models of electrical power equipment of the \nnetwork is based on the use of concentrated complex equivalent circuits, whose linear \nparameters are calculated using known analytical expressions under the assumption of \nstationarity (single part) of the electromagnetic process. Moreover, in the conditions of a \nfull-scale physical experiment with a  new electrical power equipment, the idealization of \nadjacent elements of the power network is used. Quite often, power sources of the \nexamined electrical equipment are idealized, thereby introducing methodological roughness \nand possible distortions of the  experimental results.

Refinement of electrical parameters for the adop ted (specified) \nstructure of the mathematical model of electrical power equipment is carried out using the \nmethods of identification of dynamic systems. \n2 Identification of parameters of electrical power equipment of \nthe electric power system in various applications \nConsider the task of identifying the electrical parameters (R, L & C) of some electrical \npower equipment (load , transformers, etc.) of an electrical network connected to the \nbusbars of the electric power system (EPS). To do this, we use the classi cal mathematical \ndescription of transients of electric  installations using instantaneous values of external \n(measured) and internal (model) electrical signals. At the same time, to simplify the form of \nwriting identification equations, symbolic operators o f differentiation (p) and integration \n(1/p) of functions (electrical signals) in the time domain are used. Also for clarity, the \nadopted block diagrams of identification objects are given, and the determination of the \nRLC-parameters of a given model of ele ctrical equipment is carried out as a result of \nsolving a system of nonlinear differential and integral equations of its transient processes. \nNaturally, the mathematical description of the transients of the model corresponds to the \nactual connection scheme of the investigated electrical (electromagnetic) equivalent. \nIdentification of the parameters of electrical power equipment in such a formulation of \nthe problem allows to perform the synthesis of adaptive, self -adjusting systems for \nmonitoring and controlling the operating modes of the power system.  At the same time, the \ncontrol of electric power system can be performed as a function of change (deviation) of the \nidentified RLC-parameters of the electrical network equivalent.  \nThe structural scheme of the identification of electrical parameters of electrical power \nequipment is shown in Figure 1.  \nThe scheme includes the main microprocessor  modules of  parametric identification. \nNaturally, its connection is made to its primary converters of electrical signals to measuring \nvoltage transformers TVG 1 and TVG 2, as well as to measuring current transformers TA.1 \nand TA.2 and the corresponding secondary converters of electrical current signals (current \nsensors i/u, Figure 1) and voltages (voltage sensors u/u, Figure 1). Subsequently, the \nelectrical signals of voltage and current are subjected to analog -to-digital conversion in the \nADC modules (in Figure 1, ADC blocks).  Digital voltage signals ( u) and current ( i), \nmeasured using an ADC, are fed  to a processor ( CPU, Figure 1), where integral and \ndifferential conversions of digital current and voltage signals are performed (1/p(n) and p(n)) \nblocks in Figure 1) in accordance with the mathematical formulation of the problem of \nparametric identification. The solution of the system of identification equations E(X) with \nrespect to the desired RLC – parameters is carried out using  the numerical gradient method \nin the controller (CPU module, in Figure 1), the essence of which is described below. \n \n  , 0 2019)E3S Web of Conferences https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf  /2019910100291 0 (10\nTPACEE-2018\n2 \n2\n \nFig. 1.

In particular, even with a 100% error in setting the starting \nvalues, the root-mean-square error is no more than 3% (Figure 2, a), which guarantees the \nspeed of the algorithm, even if the initial conditions are zero. \nAt the same time, the algorithm hypersensitivity to the specification of zero initial \nvalues of the electrical parameters of identification of the transformer magnetization branch  \nwas revealed. Under these starting conditions, the error reac hes a value of more than 250 \np.u. (Figure 2, c), which can lead to incorrect operation of the identification algorithm. To \neliminate this defect, it is recommended to take overestimated initial values of the identified \nresistances of the magnetizing branch. In this region of positive deviations of the \nidentification parameters, the surface of the vector function of the root -mean-square error is \nalmost linear; its field lines monotonously decrease with respect to maximum values of \nabout 250 %. The nature of the dependence of the vector function of the mean square error \nfrom the error of inaccurately specifying the initial resistances o f the secondary winding is \nalmost linear - the value of the error is proportional to the error of the initial conditions in \nmodulus over the entire range of values under study. \nTo accelerate the convergence of the pro blem of identification of electrical parameters, \nit is recommended to use the second -order sensitivity equations (equations of “fastest \ndescent”), which are used in gradient methods for solving systems of nonlinear equations.  \n2.1 Testing of identification methods for power transformers under the \nphysical experiments of the switching processes \nTesting of the developed algorithm for the identification of electrical parameters of \ntransformer equipment was carried out when performing physical experiments on the \nswitching of three -phase transformers in idle mode. When performing full-scale \nexperiments, solution of several tasks  was simultaneously performing - testing of methods \nand assessment of the effectiveness of algorithms for identif ication of electrical parameters \nof transformer equipment in non-stationary modes of their operation. Full -scale tests for the \nidentification of electrical parameters were performed for the following transformers: \n1. block three-phase two-winding transformers of type TC-630 000/330, with th e scheme \nand connection group Y /Δ-11, installed at 330 kV outdoor switchgear of the \nLeningradskaya NPP; \n2. three-phase two-winding transformers of type TDC-80 000/110, TDC-125 000/110 and \nTD-40 000/110,  with a scheme and connec tion group of windings Y/Δ -11 installed at \n110 kV substations of the 110 kV distribution network of “JSC Lenenergo”; \n3. three-phase two -winding transformer w ith dry insulation of type  \nTrihal 2 500/10, with a scheme and a connection group of windings Δ/Y -0-11, installed \nin the Substation-14 of the distribution network of JSC Nissan Manufacturing Rus (St. \nPetersburg). \nIn connection with a significant amount of physical experiments materials, the most \ntypical results of transient s are described below with reference to the two-winding \ntransformers of the TDC brand installed at 110 kV substations of the 110 kV distribution \nnetwork of JSC “ Lenenergo”.

(table 1, line 6), which almost corresponds to the value of the steady-state \ncurrent of idling IХХ = 0.55 % (table 1, line 6). \nCharacteristics of changes of identifiable electrical parameters of power transformers \nTrihal 2  500/10, TD-40 000/110, TDC -125 000/110 and  \nTC-630 000/330 in non -stationary modes of their switching on idling are almost identical. \nHowever, it should be noted that in other cases, the asymptotic change in the calculated and \naveraged characteristics of the identification parameters change of power transformers is \nobserved somewhat  earlier - at a time  of about 0 .3 s. This physical phenomenon is \nexplained by a reduced (in comparison with the above -described results) level of switching \ncurrents and, as a result, a less saturated state of the transformer. \nBased on the above, an important practical conclus ion follows that for efficient and \nhigh-quality control of the magnetization current in the su b-transient (initial) stages of non-\nstationary idling modes, a refined mathematical description of power transformer \nequipment is required, since its calculated e quivalent circuit with passport characteristics \ndoes not meet high accuracy requirements. Considering this, the results of the study of \nadaptive compensation of magnetization currents of power transformers and displacement \ncurrents, which are  typical for t he extended intersystem (interstate) connections , are \npresented in [4-10]. Unlike with the currently existing stationary compensation solutions  in \n[4-17], the use of additional software algorithms for identif ication of power equipment  \nparameters is proposed. The proposed method allows to reduce the minimum tripping \ncurrent to the level of 0 .1-0.15 p.u. and to implement a dynamic correction of the tripping \nwith a minimum level of brake signals (Кt = 0.1-0.15 p.u.). \nThe industrial introduction of such highly sensitive digital protection systems with a \nspeed equal to the period of the industrial frequency will significantly improve the stability \nof the interconnected power systems and minimize the harm from damages of the protected \nequipment. \n3 Conclusion \n1.  A methodology and software modules for identif ication of electromagnetic parameters \nof power transformers have been developed. As a result of the assessment of the sensitivity \nof identification equations of the power equipment  parameters, it is shown t hat the surface \nof the objective function always has a global minimum, which identifies the existence and \nuniqueness of the solution of the system in the space of identifications parameters. \n2. It is established that the developed software algorithm is especially sensitive to the \nassignment of zero initial values of parameters Rμ, Lμ of the magnetization branch of power \ntransformers. In the latter case, the root -mean-square error of the identific ation equations \ncan reach critical (up to 250 p.u. ) values in terms of speed and stable convergence of the \nnumerical method. Positive non -zero initial conditions are characterized by monotonously \ndecreasing vector function of the root-mean-square error E(X). \n3. The weak sensitivity of the iterative process of identif ication the longitudinal \nparameters R and L to the assignment of them with zero initial values, at which the root -\nmean-square error is less than 3  %, is revealed. Similar indexes of the algorithm sensitivity \nwere detected in assignment of zero initial values of the electrical parameters R1 and L1 σ of \nthe primary winding of a two -winding transformer. Moreover, throughout the entire \n  , 0 2019)E3S Web of Conferences https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf  /2019910100291 0 (10\nTPACEE-2018\n2 \n10\ndomain, the vector function E(X) is positive and decreases to the  convergence point of the \nsystem of equations. Near the extremum, the surface E(X) is almost uniform and linear. \n4. As a result of full-scale experiments, the approbation of the developed algorithm for \nidentification of electrical parameters of three -phase power two-winding transformers with \na rated voltage of 330 kV, 110 kV and 10 kV in non-stationary operation modes was carried \nout. It is established that the calculated and averaged characteristics of the leakage \ninductances of the HV (L1 σ) and LV (L2 σ) windings in the sub-transient (initial) stage of \nthe non-stationary switching mode of power three-phase transformers are almost linear. \nThe mutual inductance of the LV and HV  windings (M21) of three -phase power \ntransformers varies asymptotically in a fairly wide range up to ± 15 % regarding the steady-\nstate values. In the final stage of the non -stationary mode, the mutual inductance of the \ntransformer windings M21 tends to values inversely proportional to the  current value of  \nsteady-state idle mode. \n5. The impossibility of applicability the  linear calculated equivalent circuits of \ntransformer equipment, obtained based on its passport characteristics, is substantiated. It is \nshown, that in the sub-transient (initial) stages of non -stationary modes, the redu ced value \nof the error in calculating the currents of power transformers with the use of  their passport \ncharacteristics, can reach 10 -15 %. For effective and high -quality reproduction of \nmagnetizing currents of power equipment, a refined mathematical descr iption is required \ntaking into account the nonlinearity of its characteristics. \nReferences \n1.
