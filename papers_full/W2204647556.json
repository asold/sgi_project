As a result, sex differences in the behaviour of infants and juveniles\noften foreshadow sex differences in adult behaviour and social strategies in numerous mamma-\nlian species, including primates [1, 2], ungulates [3, 4], canids [5] and delphinids [6, 7]. For\nexample, infant male chimpanzees interact with more social partners, especially adult males,\nthan females, which matches adult sex-specific social tendencies of greater male gregariousness\n[8]. Similarly, female primates engage more in play parenting (e.g. chimpanzees [9], macaques\n[10]) and male rhesus monkeys show toy preferences similar to human boys [11]. However,\nbecause most studies have focused on sex differences in social interactions (but see [12]), the\nquestion is whether or not sex differences in‘preparation’ for adult life are also present with\nregards to tool use skills.\nIn primates, social learning is essential for the transmission and maintenance of tool use in a\npopulation [13– 17], whereas in tool-using birds, such as woodpecker finches and New Caledo-\nnian crows, tool use is acquired developmentally without the need for social inputs [18, 19]. In\nspecies with such a strong genetic predisposition, tool use appears early in development [19]. In\nprimates, on the other hand, tool use starts relatively late [20– 22], consistent with a cultural\ninterpretation. However, a genetic link can develop gradually through genetic assimilation on\ntop of an existing cultural adaptation (i.e. Baldwin effect [23]). Indeed, recent findings showed a\ndifference in predisposition for tool use between immature chimpanzees and bonobos reflecting\nadult tool use in these two species [24]. Hence, even socially-learned behaviours can have some\ngenetic basis. This can concern both species differences and sex differences within a species.\nChimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and bonobos (Pan paniscus) are our closest living relatives\nand had a common ancestor about one million years ago [25]. Whereas wild chimpanzees use\ntools extensively in feeding, social and self-maintenance contexts [26], bonobos use few tools\nand none in foraging [27]. Moreover, captive bonobos show most tool use in play [28]. Early\nstudies on wild chimpanzees suggested that female chimpanzees are more avid and competent\nforaging tool users than males: females at Gombe (Tanzania) used tools to fish for termites\nmore often and for longer times than did males [29]. Chimpanzee females spent more time\nant-fishing than males at Mahale (Tanzania) [30] and were more efficient at cracking nuts\nthan males at Taï (Ivory Coast) [31]. These findings suggest a sex bias in feeding tool use\ntowards adult female chimpanzees. Tool use in captive bonobos also seems to be female-biased,\nwith females using a greater diversity of tool types than males [28], and females acquiring an\nexperimental tool use task faster and performing more tool use than males [32]. No informa-\ntion exists on sex differences in tool use by wild bonobos [27], but given the rarity of tool use\nthey are unlikely to be pronounced.\nIn contrast, studies of human children generally report a sex difference in tool use in favour\nof boys (reviewed in [33, 34]). For example, in a study of three-year-old children, boys were\nmore likely than girls to engage in object-oriented play and to solve a simple problem using a\ntool [34]. Moreover, girls exposed to abnormally high levels of prenatal androgen engaged in\nmore object-oriented play than unaffected girls [35]. The apparent male-biased sex difference\nin object manipulation and tool use in human children has been proposed to reflect an ontoge-\nnetic adaptation to an adult life in which making and using tools for hunting plays an impor-\ntant role for men, whereas women gather [33]. However, because gathering and especially\nsubsequent processing also are tool-based, alternative hypotheses cannot be excluded.\nThe goal of this study was to investigate whether sex differences in object manipulation in\nimmature apes function as preparation for tool use in adulthood (‘preparation for tool use’\nhypothesis). Moreover, we aimed to shed light on the discrepancy between the reported sex\nObject Manipulation in Wild Immature Chimpanzees and Bonobos\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0139909 October 7, 2015 2/1 5\nCompeting Interests:The authors have declared\nthat no competing interests exist.\ndifferences in tool use and object manipulation of human children and chimpanzees. Object\nmanipulation (including object play) is considered a precursor to tool use [36– 38] and provides\na measure of a species’ predisposition to engage with objects [39]. As expected, young chim-\npanzees show higher rates of object manipulation than age-matched bonobos [24]. This sug-\ngests that immature chimpanzees prepare for tool use in adulthood by manipulating objects,\nwhereas bonobos do this to a lesser extent.\nTo test the‘preparation for tool use’ hypothesis, information is needed on both sex differ-\nences and developmental changes in object manipulation in wild immature apes. We studied\nobject manipulation in immature chimpanzees (P. t. schweinfurthii) at Kalinzu (Uganda) and\nbonobos at Wamba (Democratic Republic of Congo). Chimpanzees at Kalinzu commonly use\ntools to harvest army ants [40]. This type of tool use involves the use of a stick or wand of\nwoody vegetation to harvest the aggressive driver ants (Dorylus spp.) from their underground\nnest. Bonobos at Wamba use tools only in non-feeding contexts, i.e. social contexts, comfort\nand protection from the rain [27].\nWe tested the predictions of the‘preparation for tool use’ hypothesis (Table 1a). First, we\nexamined the effects of sex and age on manipulation rates. We predicted a female bias in object\nmanipulation in chimpanzees and no sex difference in bonobos. Moreover, we expected higher\nobject manipulation rates in younger immatures in both species. Second, we investigated spe-\ncies, sex and age differences in manipulation types (i.e. playvs. other). We expected more\ndiverse (i.e. less play-dominated) manipulation types in chimpanzees compared to bonobos, as\nwell as more diverse manipulation types in female compared to male chimpanzees. We pre-\ndicted that, as chimpanzee infants get older, manipulation types would become more diverse\nand less dominated by play. In bonobos, we expected play to remain the same with age [28].\nThird, we assessed species, sex and age differences in object types (i.e. leaf, stick, fruit). We pre-\ndicted that chimpanzees would interact relatively more with tool-like sticks, whereas bonobos\nwere expected to manipulate all object types. We predicted no sex differences in object types\nmanipulated. Lastly, in chimpanzees, we predicted a developmental change in the object types\nmanipulated, with objects increasingly approximating stick tools used by adult Kalinzu chim-\npanzees. In bonobos we predicted no effect of age on object types. This study is exploratory in\nnature, since little is known about the potential role of object manipulation in preparation for\ntool use. Hence, we measured all types of object manipulation. We aimed to find out whether\nTable 1. a) Predictions of the‘preparation for tool use’ hypothesis sensu lato(F = female, M = male, Young =<3 yrs, Old =>3 yrs), and b) results\nfrom this study (✓ = confirmed/significant,✗ = not confirmed/non-significant).\na) Predictions Variables measured b) Predictions conﬁrmed?\nSpecies Chimpanzee: Bonobo: Chimpanzee: Bonobo:\n1.

Permission to carry out research at Wamba in the Luo Scientific\nReserve was granted and approved through permits from the Ministry of Higher Education,\nUniversity and Scientific Research and the Centre of Research of Ecology and Forestry (CREF).\nStudy Areas and Subjects\nKalinzu Forest Reserve is in western Uganda (30° 07’ E, 0° 17’ S[ 41]). The forest is classified as\nmedium-altitude moist evergreen forest [42, 43]. We collected data on immature members\n(0.7– 7.1 yrs,Table 2) of the main study community (M-group), which consisted of 97 individu-\nals (19 adult males, 29 adult females). Data collection took place from December 2012 to\nMarch 2013, covering the late rainy season and dry season (January onwards) [44]. Wamba is\nin the northern section of the Luo Scientific Reserve in the Democratic Republic of Congo\n(research camp: 0° 11’ 08” N, 22° 37’ 58” E[ 45]). The habitat comprises primary, old second-\nary, young secondary and swamp forest [46]. There are two neighbouring study groups:\nE1-group (31 individuals: 7 adult males, 9 adult females) and P-group (28 individuals: 5 adult\nmales, 7 adult females). We collected data on immature members (1.2– 6.8 yrs,Table 3) of both\ncommunities. Data collection took place from May to August 2013, covering parts of the wet\nand dry seasons (July onwards) [47].\nData Collection\nBehavioural data collection involved focal animal sampling [48]. We collected data on 14 chim-\npanzees (7 males, 7 females,Table 2) in M-group and 16 bonobos (7 males, 9 females,Table 3)\nTable 2.

At Kalinzu, we collected 109.3 hrs of observations\n(mean observation time per individual = 7.9 hr). At Wamba, we collected 210.6 hrs of observa-\ntions (mean observation time per individual = 13.2 hr). All focal individuals were followed on\nat least three different days, and observation times were balanced for time of day. Focal individ-\nuals were followed for 30– 120 min per follow (mean duration: bonobo: 81.7 min, chimpanzee:\n75.6 min). Every two min, we recorded the focal animal’s general activity (i.e. feed, rest, move,\nplay, groom) and location (i.e. terrestrial, arboreal). In addition, we recorded all occurrences of\nobject manipulation bouts during focal follows. An object manipulation bout was defined as\ncontinuous manipulation of the same (detached) object with hands, feet or mouth. A new bout\nwas scored when the object(s) changed or when there was a break of at least 2 minutes in object\nmanipulation. For all object manipulation bouts, we noted the type of manipulation (i.e. play,\nexplore/touch, tool use, bite/chew, break/pluck, carry, throw/drop) and the type of object (i.e.\nleaf, stick, fruit, other).Play: Manipulating object with no apparent immediate goal, including\nrepetitive movements, alone or together with other individual(s) and often associated with a\nplay face.Explore/touch: Non-repetitive touching and exploring of object with hands, feet or\nmouth without apparent feeding purpose, usually destructive.Tool use: Using object as a\nmeans to achieve an end (e.g. ant dip, branch drag, penis wipe).Bite/chew: Biting or chewing\nobject without ingestion.Break/pluck: Breaking (off) object or plucking object without appar-\nent feeding purpose.Carry: Carrying object in hands, feet or mouth.Throw/drop: Throwing\nobject or intentionally dropping object from an elevated position. We did not include actual\nfeeding behaviour (i.e. ingestion). The category‘stick’ included woody vegetation with and\nwithout leaves. The category‘other’ included moss, seeds, seedpods and bird’s nest.\nStatistical Analyses\nWe tested data for normality using a normal probability plot and a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test\n[49]. We performed statistical tests in IBM SPSS version 21.0. All analyses were two-tailed and\nsignificance levels were set at 0.05. We performed a logarithmic transformation for object\nTable 3.

To\ncompare object manipulation rates between the sexes and between age categories (<3 yrsvs.\n>3 yrs) within both species we used Independent Samples T-tests, since inequality of variances\nand small sample sizes did not allow within species ANCOVAs. The age category cut-off point\nwas chosen at 3 yrs old, since chimpanzees achieve independence in locomotion and nest-\nbuilding around this age [50, 51]. We excluded one significant outlier individual (i.e.Max,\nTable 2) from the comparison of object manipulation rates between age categories in chimpan-\nzees. This individual was an outlier only in the analysis of age categories. Since exclusion of this\nindividual had no effect on the outcomes of the other analyses of object manipulation rates, we\nincluded the individual in these analyses. We correlated object manipulation rates with age\nusing Pearson’s Correlations for both chimpanzees and bonobos.\nIn addition, we compared object manipulation bout lengths between species, sexes and age\ncategories. We estimated bout lengths based on all occurrences sampling of object manipulation\nbetween scans, as well as on the 2-min activity scans. We used the following categories to estimate\nmean bout lengths: 0– 2 min = 1 min, 0– 4 min = 2 min, 2– 4m i n=3m i n ,2– 6 min = 4 min, 4– 6\nmin = 5 min, 4– 8 min = 6 min, 6– 8m i n=7m i n ,6– 10 min = 8 min, 8– 10 min = 9 min, 8– 12\nmin = 10 min. We discarded bouts that either started before the focal follow or were not finished\nwhen the focal follow ended. Based on the values for all bouts per individual, we calculated a\nmean object manipulation bout length for each individual. We performed a logarithmic transfor-\nmation for mean bout length and all further analyses were done on the transformed values. We\nconducted analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) with the fixed factors species and sex, object\nmanipulation bout length (min) as the dependent variable, and age as covariate. We correlated\nmean bout lengths with age using Pearson’s Correlations for both chimpanzees and bonobos.\nWe compared object manipulation types (i.e. playvs. other) between species, sexes and age\ncategories using Chi-squares tests. We also compared manipulation of different object types\nbetween species, sexes and age categories using Chi-square tests. We determined the categories\nin which proportions of object manipulation bouts differed between species, age classes or\nsexes, by inspecting adjusted residuals (adj. res.), which are approximately normally distrib-\nuted, and controlled for multiple testing with the improved Bonferroni procedure [52].\nResults\nObject Manipulation\nWe compared object manipulation rates (Tables2 and 3) between the two species and sexes\ncontrolling for age. In an ANCOVA, object manipulation rates were higher for chimpanzees as\ncompared to bonobos (F [1, 25] = 18.0,P < 0.0001) when controlling for age (F [1, 25] = 22.3,\nP < 0.0001), but no sex difference was found (F [1, 25] = 1.3,P = 0.259). There was no interac-\ntion between Age and Species (F [1, 24] = 0.522,P = 0.477) or Age and Sex (F [1, 24] = 0.545,\nP = 0.467). However, there was a significant interaction between Species and Sex (F [1, 25] =\n6.0, P = 0.021) and we therefore had to compare object manipulation rates in chimpanzees and\nbonobos separately.\nWhen comparing the sexes within species, we found that in chimpanzees mean object\nmanipulation rates were 1.52 ± 1.01 bouts/hr for males and 0.53 ± 0.31 bouts/hr for females. In\nbonobos, mean object manipulation rates were 0.47 ± 0.30 bouts/hr for males and 0.46 ± 0.37\nbouts/hr for females. In chimpanzees, males showed significantly higher object manipulation\nrates than females (Independent Samples T-test: t = 2.8, df = 12,P = 0.019,Fig 1), whereas\nbonobos showed no significant sex difference (t = 0.15, df = 14,P = 0.886,Fig 1).\nObject Manipulation in Wild Immature Chimpanzees and Bonobos\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0139909 October 7, 2015 6/1 5\nWe examined age differences in object manipulation rates within species. We found a nega-\ntive correlation between age and object manipulation rate in both bonobos (r = -0.801, N = 16,\nP < 0.0001) and chimpanzees (r = -0.690, N = 14,P = 0.006). In chimpanzees, mean object\nmanipulation rates were 1.30 ± 0.61 bouts/hr for immatures<3 yrs old and 0.46 ± 0.21 bouts/\nhr for immatures>3 yrs old. In bonobos, mean object manipulation rates were 0.72 ± 0.20\nbouts/hr for immatures<3 yrs old and 0.27 ± 0.27 bouts/hr for immatures>3 yrs old. Younger\nimmatures showed significantly higher object manipulation rates than older immatures in\nboth chimpanzees (Independent Samples T-test: t = 4.0, df = 11,P = 0.002,Fig 2) and bonobos\n(Independent Samples T-test: t = 4.0, df = 14,P = 0.001,Fig 2).\nFig 1.

We found no species difference (F\n[1, 25] = 0.001,P = 0.982, Tables2 and 3) and no sex difference (F [1, 25] = 0.461,P = 0.503,\nTables 2 and 3) in mean estimated object manipulation bout length when controlling for age (F\n[1, 25] = 6.572,P = 0.017). There was no interaction between Species and Sex (F [1, 25] =\n0.020, P = 0.889). Moreover, there was no interaction between Age and Species (F [1, 24] =\n0.036, P = 0.852) and Age and Sex (F [1, 24] = 1.095,P = 0.306). No significant correlations\nwere found between age and bout length in bonobos (r = -0.452, N = 16,P = 0.079) or chim-\npanzees (r = -0.436, N = 14,P = 0.119).\nManipulation Types\nWe compared object manipulation types between chimpanzees and bonobos. Chimpanzees\nhad larger contributions of manipulation types other than play compared to bonobos (Fig 3A\nand 3B). We compared the relative contribution of playvs. other manipulation types and\nfound that object manipulation by bonobos consisted of more play compared to chimpanzees\n(χ2 = 24.842, df = 1,P < 0.0001). In bonobos, males and females did not differ with regards to\nmanipulation types (χ2 = 1.027, df = 1,P = 0.311,Fig 3C and 3D). In chimpanzees, object\nmanipulation by males contained relatively more play compared to females (χ2 = 10.100,\ndf = 1,P = 0.001,Fig 3E and 3F). In bonobos, no difference in manipulation types was found\nbetween <3 yr vs.>3 yr olds (χ2 = 1.694, df = 1,P = 0.193,Fig 3G and 3H). In chimpanzees,\nobject manipulation bouts by younger immatures contained relatively more play than those by\nolder immatures (χ2 = 32.088, df = 1,P < 0.0001, Fig 3I and 3J).\nObject Types\nBoth chimpanzees and bonobos manipulated leaves, sticks and fruits (Fig 4). The types of\nobjects most often used in object manipulation bouts (chimpanzee: N = 105; bonobo: N = 98)\nwere leaves (chimpanzee: 39.6%; bonobo: 28.6%) and sticks (chimpanzee: 44.3%; bonobo:\n49.0%). Bonobos and chimpanzees differed significantly in how much they manipulated differ-\nent types of objects (χ\n2 = 18.697, df = 3,P < 0.0001, Fig 4) with bonobos manipulating rela-\ntively more fruits compared to chimpanzees (17.3% vs. 1.9%, adj. res. = 3.8,P < 0.0001, Fig 4).\nWe also compared object types manipulated by males versus females in both species. We\nfound no sex difference in the types of objects manipulated by immature chimpanzees (χ2 =\n1.1, df = 2,P = 0.565) or bonobos (χ2 = 3.1, df = 2,P = 0.214).\nFinally, we examined age effects by comparing types of objects manipulated by individuals\n<3 yrs compared to>3 yrs old in both species. In chimpanzees, there was a significant age dif-\nference in the types of objects manipulated (χ2 = 10.0, df = 2,P = 0.007,Fig 5). Below the age of\n3 yrs chimpanzees manipulated relatively more leaves (adj. res. = 3.0,P = 0.003), whereas\nabove 3 yrs they manipulated relatively more sticks (adj. res. = 2.9,P = 0.004). In bonobos, no\nage difference in types of objects manipulated was found (χ2 = 3.3, df = 2,P = 0.193).\nDiscussion\nObject Manipulation\nWe confirmed most predictions of the‘preparation for tool use’ hypothesis (Table 1a and 1b).\nHowever, surprisingly, we found higher rates of object manipulation in immature male versus\nfemale chimpanzees. This is contrary to what we would expect based on the reported sex differ-\nences in tool use in adult chimpanzees, but agrees with the sex bias found in human children.\nWhat can explain these higher rates of object manipulation in immature male chimpanzees?\nObject Manipulation in Wild Immature Chimpanzees and Bonobos\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0139909 October 7, 2015 8/1 5\nFig 3.

Tool use has been hypothesized to provide chimpanzee females with an\nalternative source of animal protein and micronutrients, which males obtain by hunting [29].\nThis suggests that Kalinzu females may also be more engaged in tool supported ant-dipping,\nbut no information is currently available on adult sex differences, nor on whether males share\nmeat with females at Kalinzu, like they do for example at Taï [53]. On the other hand, ant-dip-\nping frequencies at Gombe and Bossou (Guinea) showed no significant sex differences [16, 29].\nAnd female chimpanzees at Fongoli (Senegal) hunt more with tools than males [54, 55]. How-\never, given the strong female tendency toward higher rates of insectivory in chimpanzees [29,\n30], it is most parsimonious to assume a female bias in adult tool use exists at Kalinzu.\nThe observed patterns of object manipulation rates among young immature chimpanzees\ndid not seem to reflect preparation for adult subsistence tool use. First, we observed higher\nobject manipulation rates in male as compared to female chimpanzees. Second, we observed\nsimilar rates of object manipulation in chimpanzee females and bonobos of both sexes. Third,\ntool-use related object manipulation first emerged only in older immature chimpanzees. In\nfact, we recorded only two instances of subsistence-related object manipulation (i.e. ant dip,\nexplorative probe), both involving older immature males aged 5.3 yrs and 6.1 yrs. The latter\npoint suggests that investigation of manipulationtypes, rather than overall manipulation rates,\nmay be more informative in assessing preparation for tool use in immature apes.\nManipulation Types\nThe two species differed in their so-called manipulation‘profiles’ (Table 1b). Object manipula-\ntion by bonobos was 90% play compared to 59% in chimpanzees. In bonobos, play-dominated\nobject manipulation was consistent across sexes and ages. In chimpanzees, on the other hand,\nplay accounted for most object manipulation in males (69%), but not in females (36%). Female\nchimpanzees invested more time in manipulation of objects outside a play context, such as\ntouch/explore, break/pluck and bite/chew. Hence, the more diverse, less play-dominated,\nmanipulation types favoured by immature female chimpanzees compared to males are in line\nFig 5. Proportion of object manipulation bouts across object types for chimpanzees<3 yrs and>3 yrs old.Object manipulation bouts (%) across\nobject types for immature chimpanzees<3 yr old (grey) and>3 yr old (white).* Chi-square test:P < 0.05\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0139909.g005\nObject Manipulation in Wild Immature Chimpanzees and Bonobos\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0139909 October 7, 2015 10 / 15\nwith preparation for tool use in adult life. Due to sample size limitations across the different\nobject manipulation types, these results should be considered preliminary.\nThe observed male-bias in object manipulation rates in Kalinzu chimpanzees suggests that\nobject manipulation by immature males, especially in play, may reflect practice of general\nmotor skills in relation to male-specific behaviours involving objects, such as dominance dis-\nplays and predator mobbing [56, 57]. The fact that most object manipulation by males, and by\nyounger immatures in general, was object play, suggests that at least the younger individuals\n(i.e. who have not yet acquired independence in locomotion and social interactions) primarily\npracticed general motor and social skills, rather than specific tool use related skills.\nImmature females, on the other hand, showed less object manipulation, especially in play,\nlikely due to more diverse and foraging-related activities overall. At Gombe, immature female\nchimpanzees paid more attention to their mothers using tools in termite-fishing and became\nproficient tool users at an earlier age than males [12, 58]. Immature females seemed to focus\ntheir attention on relevant tool use tasks and thus learned quicker, whereas males seemed to do\nmore undirected exploration in play. It has to be noted that due to the imbalance in age distri-\nbutions of males and females in our study, more data are needed to confirm the observed sex\ndifferences in object manipulation rates and manipulation types.\nIn addition, we found an effect of age on manipulation types in chimpanzees, but not in\nbonobos. Object manipulation by older immature chimpanzees ceased to be dominated by\nplay, but contained various other types of manipulation (including tool use). In bonobos, play\ndominated object manipulation in both younger and older immatures. This result fits with pre-\nviously reported findings on developmental differences between chimpanzees and bonobos\nthat promote juvenile behaviours and cognitive mechanisms in bonobos throughout life, such\nas high levels of adult play [59, 60].\nObject Types\nChimpanzee and bonobo immatures engaged with a similar range of objects, but bonobo object\nmanipulation involved relatively more fruits, or fruit parts. Bonobos played with the fruits of\n10 tree species versus only two species for chimpanzees. However, a direct comparison is prob-\nlematic, since fruit availability varies between the two study sites, as well as seasonally. Future\nresearch will need to address this in more detail.\nYoung chimpanzees manipulated and played more with leaves, whereas older immatures\nengaged more with sticks (Table 1b). In bonobos, no age difference emerged in the types of\nobjects manipulated. Chimpanzees at Kalinzu use foraging tools primarily in ant-dipping.\nHence, the main tool type used by adult chimpanzees at Kalinzu is a stick. The increased use of\nsticks in object manipulation by older immatures suggests that social learning during ontogeny\nshapes the types of objects young apes interact with, and directs their attention towards rele-\nvant objects. Due to the limited number of observations for the different object types these\nfindings have to be considered preliminary.\nOne promising direction for future research is to compare object manipulation rates and\nobject types manipulated in immatures across chimpanzee study sites with different types of\ntool use repertoires. At some sites, for instance, adults use mainly leaf-based tools, whereas at\nothers, they rely largely on stick-based tools. Likewise, pounding tool use is common at some\nsites, but absent at others. If age changes in object manipulation among immatures mimic\nadult tool use behaviours, we expect young chimpanzees at a site where adult chimpanzees use\nleaves, but not sticks as tools, to continue manipulating leaves instead of switching to sticks.\nObject Manipulation in Wild Immature Chimpanzees and Bonobos\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0139909 October 7, 2015 11 / 15\nConclusions\nChimpanzees showed a sex difference in object manipulation, whereas no such difference was\nfound in bonobos. Male chimpanzees showed higher rates of object manipulation than females,\nwhich is contrary to expectation based on the‘preparation for tool use’ hypothesis. However,\nfemale chimpanzees showed more diverse types of object manipulation compared to play-\ndominated object manipulation by males. We propose that object play in younger immatures,\nespecially males, mainly concerns preparation for adulthood in terms of practising general\nmotor skills. Older immature chimpanzees seem to prepare for adulthood by performing more\nsubsistence-related object manipulation. The switch from non-tool to tool materials in imma-\nture Kalinzu chimpanzees further suggests that older immatures become more focussed on\nfunctionally relevant materials in object manipulation.\nThe apparent similarity between humans and chimpanzees in the observed male bias in\nobject manipulation is note-worthy. In both species males engage in aggressive dominance\ndisplays [61, 62], which sometimes involve the aimed throwing of objects [56, 63]. Similar\nbehaviours are shown in the predator-mobbing context, again predominantly by males [64,\n65]. These patterns are consistent with the hypothesis that the motivation of young\nchimpanzee and human males to throw and hit with objects in play may reflect a preparation\nfor object use in display and defence, which in humans acted as a pre-adaptation to weapon\nuse.\nObject manipulation in our closest living relatives may inform us about the possible biologi-\ncal basis of sex differences in object manipulation and tool use in human children. Our finding\nthat in chimpanzee infants, like humans, object-oriented play is biased towards males may\nreflect a shared evolutionary history for this trait dating back to the last common ancestor of\nhumans andPan. Thus,‘preparation’ in immatures at different points in their development\nmay be for various different sex-biased adult activities. Resolving this issue in our closest living\nrelatives may help us to identify the functions of the highly debated gender differences among\nchildren.\nSupporting Information\nS1 Table.
