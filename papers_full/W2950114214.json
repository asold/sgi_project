INTRODUCTION\nPreventive maintenance of machinery and other objects is\nbecoming more and more suppressed by continuous moni-\ntoring. Such trends are not only noticeable in engineering,\nVOLUME 7, 2019 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License.

Secicet al.: Vibro-Acoustic Methods in the Condition Assessment of Power Transformers\nbut in other areas as well, e.g. medicine: there are more\nand more systems that provide continuous monitoring of\nsingle human organs and, consequently, early detection of\ndiseases. There are many reasons for this: on the one hand,\nrapid development of technology enables continuous data\nmonitoring, big data storage, faster, more complex and more\nreliable data analysis; development of complex monitoring\nsystems and their interconnection allows the formation of\ndata clusters which describe certain physical phenomena as\na result of mechanical, thermal, electromagnetic or other\ntypes of processes inside or outside the observed object.\nOn the other hand, sensors are getting smaller and less power\nintensive, e.g. the development of sensors based on micro-\nelectro-mechanical systems (MEMS sensors). Furthermore,\neasier and faster access to stored data enables an intelligent\napproach to condition assessment because it can now be based\non previously gained experiences and allows the application\nof artiﬁcial intelligence or machine learning. In doing so,\nobtained data can be grouped in the appropriate clusters\nbased on the same object design characteristics which leads\nto the formation of databases that can be used in experimental\nframeworks for further development of diagnostic methods.\nThus far, this approach has been proven to be reasonable\nand justiﬁed. The requirements for improved system uptime,\nreliability and availability of the future smart grid calls for\nthe shift from time-based or condition-based maintenance\ntowards the maintenance based on continuous online moni-\ntoring of the equipment operating conditions [1]. Increased\nrequirements also point to the need of the ability of such\nmonitoring solutions to inform about potential failure even\nbefore it happens as well as provide ongoing maintenance rec-\nommendations. An excellent paper on transition from ofﬂine\nto online transformer winding deformation diagnostics is one\nfrom Bagheri et al. [2], where they classify winding defor-\nmations, give an overview of both ofﬂine and online methods\nand then address practical problems of their implementation.\nA continuous online monitoring system has to meet several\ngoals. One of the most important goals is that the applied\nmethods should not interfere with the normal operation of\nthe monitored object. Also, they should not require any\nspecial mode of operation. Many published papers on this\nsubject (and this seems like a trend in the modern diagnostic\napproach) are about the analysis of acoustic signals. This is\nquite logical because the collection of such data sets generally\nrepresents a non-invasive method.\nOne can state that the most sensitive part of a power\ntransformer is the on-load tap changer (OLTC). This conclu-\nsion stems from several surveys carried out on the national\nand international level that studied the reliability of power\ntransformers. First survey conducted by CIGRÉ published\nin 1983 [3] analysed data from 13 countries. Data has shown\nthat about 41% of failures were due to the OLTC (Fig. 1).\nGiven that the OLTC contacts are the only movable part\nof the transformer and that every mechanical movement is\naccompanied by occurrences such as friction which cause\nwear & tear and ultimately damage to the contacts, it is no\nFIGURE 1. Power transformer failure location analysis from 1983\nreport [3] and 2015 report [4] .\nwonder that OLTC is a very common cause of failure. Besides\nOLTC, common causes of failures on power transformers are\nshort circuits and deformations of its windings. According to\nthe aforementioned study, core, windings and OLTC failures\nconstitute 63% of all observed failures. Some newer compiled\nfailure statistics [4] (transformer failure data from 22 coun-\ntries) show progress in the reliability of the OLTC (27%), but\nthere is still a high percentage of failures connected to wind-\nings (40%) and core (3.4%) (see Fig. 1). This is precisely the\nreason why this paper focuses on vibro-acoustic diagnostic\nmethods for these three parts of the transformer.\nPrecisely speaking, vibro-acoustic methods should also\ninclude acoustic methods related to partial discharge (PD)\ndetection. Partial discharge causes occasional breakdowns\nin electrical insulation. PD activity causes several physical\neffects including optical (light), thermal, chemical, electro-\nmagnetic and other phenomena. Such breakdowns in turn\nalso cause the appearance of the acoustic waves that can be\nmonitored by appropriate sensors placed on the tank of the\ntransformer. However, issues related to PD are beyond the\nscope of this paper.\nRest of the paper is structured as follows: in section II\na brief overview of causes behind transformer vibrations is\ngiven; in section III, diagnostic data collection and prepro-\ncessing are discussed; sections IV and V are the focus of\nthe work and here the literature on vibro-acoustic methods\nfor condition assessment of power transformers is surveyed.\nIn section VI, the surveyed literature is summarised in a table\nformat and taxonomy is provided. Section VII concludes this\npaper. In the end, in Section VIII, we provide a glimpse\ntowards future.\nII. CAUSES OF TRANSFORMER VIBRATIONS\nMain cause of transformer core vibrations is magnetostriction-\na property of ferromagnetic material to change its shape under\nthe inﬂuence of a magnetic ﬁeld. Magnetostrictive stress vs.\nmagnetic induction curve of iron can be approximated with a\nquadratic formula (Fig. 2) since the magnetostrictive stress is\nproportional to the square of the magnetic induction [5]–[7].\nThus, it also correlated to the square of the applied voltage.\nOn the other hand, current through the transformer windings\ninduces axial, radial and combined Lorentz forces which try\n83916 VOLUME 7, 2019\nA. Secicet al.: Vibro-Acoustic Methods in the Condition Assessment of Power Transformers\nFIGURE 2. Iron magnetostriction as a function of induction—taken\nfrom [6] .\nto compress and stretch the windings, respectively [5]–[7].\nLorentz forces are proportional to the square of the current.\nV oltages and currents are mutually dependent and since they\ncause transformer core and windings vibrations, respectively,\nbulk of the works in this ﬁeld treat the problem of diagnosing\nthese two vibrations simultaneously.\nTransformer core and windings vibrations propagate\nthrough the transformer oil and reach the transformer housing\nwhich will also, in turn, start vibrating. The viscosity of trans-\nformer oil as well as any rigid structures (reﬂection) affect\nthe propagation of vibrations towards the chassis. Therefore,\nall these issues must be taken into account when choosing\nthe appropriate sensors and points for sensor placement to\nperform the measurements.\nMotion of the OLTC contacts will cause vibrations that can\nbe sensed on the OLTC housing. Ageing of the contacts or\nearly occurrence of a defect (deformation) cause changes in\nthe vibration pattern. Therefore, by analysing these signals\nit is possible to establish a diagnostic method which can be\nused to evaluate the condition of the OLTC contacts, without\ndisassembling its chamber. It is possible to detect faults in\nthe OLTC tap selector and the diverter switch by means of\nvibration measurements.\nIII. DIAGNOSTIC DATA COLLECTION\nAND PREPROCESSING\nA. DIAGNOSTIC DATA COLLECTION\nIn the majority of the surveyed literature, the authors used\ncommercial accelerometers for recording vibration signals.\nThese sensors typically have a limited linear frequency\nbandwidth as well as a resonance bandwidth with the cor-\nresponding resonance frequency. The frequency of observed\nphenomena should be adjusted to the bandwidth of the sensor.\nIt is important to note that the mounting method of the sensor\nto the object can directly affect the accelerometer’s HF oper-\nating range, e.g. the characteristics of M608A11 commercial\naccelerometer provided in the manufacturer documentation\n(Fig. 3).\nFIGURE 3. Effects of mounting configurations on high-frequency\nresponse for commercial accelerometer M608A11 [8].\nThus, for accurate diagnostics, it is crucial to choose not\nonly the appropriate sensors but also to pay attention to\nthe mounting method and how it affects the sensor’s fre-\nquency response. Furthermore, the ability to synchronise\nmeasurements when multiple sensors are used is also cru-\ncial. Additionally, different physical phenomena can manifest\nthemselves in the acquired signals and, as will be shown later,\na lot of authors employed auxiliary measurements in their\nacquisition systems (e.g. OLTC motor current, temperature,\nOLTC motor rotor angle in [9]). The location of the sensors\nis also very important and in many papers authors sought\nthe optimal sensor location by trying to maximise signal-\nto-noise ratio (SNR) or by mounting the sensor as close to\nthe source of vibrations as possible. Since the sensors are\nmounted on HV objects, additional precautions in the form of\nelectrical insulation can be taken if necessary. For example,\nSanz-Bobi et al. [10] covered every electrical contact with\nsilicone and every sensor cable was inserted in a ﬁbreglass\nenvelope to address the insulation and electromagnetic issues\nfor the sensors installed inside a transformer.\nHydro-Québec’s experiences in OLTC diagnostics have\nbeen reported in [11]. They used a vibro-acoustic sensor\nmounted on the OLTC tank as close as possible to the OLTC\ndiverter switch. OLTC motor current was used for trigger-\ning the tap change measurement. Field experience showed\nthat the vibro-acoustic signature is signiﬁcantly affected by\nambient temperature, and it was reported that a switching\ntime of a healthy OLTC is increased by 26 ms at ambient\ntemperature of −11◦C compared to the ambient temperature\nof 27 ◦C and that this could be erroneously interpreted as a\nfaulty condition. The recorded signature was compensated\nfor the temperature using ﬁrst-order time-realignment tech-\nnique [12]. Alongside accelerometers and OLTC motor cur-\nrent measurements, Brikci et al. [13] also used a high-speed\ncamera to record OLTC movement and dynamic resistance\nmeasurements.\nVOLUME 7, 2019 83917\nA. Secicet al.: Vibro-Acoustic Methods in the Condition Assessment of Power Transformers\nTo summarise, the following issues must be addressed in\norder to conduct quality diagnostics of a power transformer:\n• sensor mounting method;\n• synchronisation of measurements if multiple sensors are\nutilised;\n• prediction and understanding of underlying physical\nphenomena which can be manifested in the collected\nsignals;\n• sensor location;\n• sensor insulation.\nExperimental results demonstrate that for the proper diag-\nnostics of transformer core and windings based on vibro-\nacoustic measurements it is usually enough to observe the\nfrequency spectrum in the range up to 1 kHz [14], [15],\nalthough harmonics up to 2 kHz were observed in [16]\nand [17]. On the other hand, OLTC diagnostics require\nobservation of a higher frequency range-up to 10 kHz [18],\nalthough some authors [19]–[21] observed a much higher\nfrequency spectra (even up to several hundreds of kHz) in\norder to be able to apply some digital ﬁltration techniques,\nor to be able to observe not only acoustic events of the\nmechanical origin, but also other events, e.g. emergence of\nelectric arc or events related to PD activity. PD analysis is\nusually performed in the UHF spectrum (300 MHz–1 GHz).\nHowever, during the process of PD inside the transformer\ntank, some part of the electrical energy from the PD pulse\n(about 1–5%) is converted to the mechanical energy, which\nresults in the emission of the acoustic wave [22]. This fact\nis used by acoustic emission partial discharge monitoring\nmethods, where emitted waves are captured by piezo-electric\nsensors mounted on the external wall of the transformer tank.\nThe dominant frequencies observed of recorded PD signals\ntypically lie in the range of 70 kHz to 180 kHz [23], which are\nquite higher when compared to the signals generated by trans-\nformer vibrations or OLTC operation. Besides accelerome-\nters, some researchers also used other types of sensors such\nas hydrophone [19] or strain gauge sensors [24].\nIn [25], a 2 mm thick ﬁbre-optics vibration sensor was suc-\ncessfully installed in the gap between the windings of a power\ntransformer to measure axial vibration. The sensor accurately\nregistered vibration frequencies between 5 Hz and 1000 Hz.\nKung et al. noted that by splicing a single mode ﬁbre to the\nFabry-Perot cavity, the whole ﬁbre acts as a vibration sensor\nand can function without a ‘‘diving board’’.\nAn interesting study was conducted in [19] where the\nauthors compared samples that were gathered simultaneously\nfrom several sensor types mounted in/on the OLTC. Besides\nthe standard accelerometer, a hydrophone and a wide-band\ncontact transducer were used as well. Power density spec-\ntrum analysis showed a number of differences between these\nsignals. The signal recorded with the hydrophone contained\nfrequencies with the largest share in the band 0–50 kHz\nand such a signal is not reliable for establishing diagnostics\nbecause the transducer is very sensitive to electromagnetic\ninterference in that frequency range due to the current through\nOLTC’s contacts. On the other hand, a signal acquired with a\nwide-band transducer, that contains frequency components in\nthe range 10 kHz–500 kHz is the best choice for OLTC diag-\nnostics as it also allows analysis of acoustic emission (AE)\nsignals during current ﬂow and electrical discharges when\nhigher frequency components are present. However, time\ndomain plot shows that hydrophone captures events that are\nnot so evident in the signal gathered with contact sensor\ntypes. Also, by using a hydrophone immersed in oil it is\npossible to avoid contact problems demonstrated in Fig. 3.\nBeltle and Tenbohlen [26] also used a hydrophone immersed\nin transformer oil and an accelerometer mounted on the\ntransformer’s tank. Although the hydrophone shows better\nSNR compared to the accelerometer, the inaccessibility of\ninsulation oil as a medium in which the hydrophone should\nbe immersed makes this sensor less attractive compared to the\ncontact sensor types. Signal acquired with an accelerometer\ncontains low frequencies in the range 0–10 kHz and thus it\nonly allows analysis of AE signals of the mechanical origin.\nHowever, the accelerometer is the most commonly used type\nof sensor in the vibro-acoustic OLTC diagnostics.\nFinally, accelerometer output is usually a voltage signal\nthat contains some unwanted frequency content. That is the\nreason why this signal needs to be passed through a series\nof high pass and low-pass hardware or software ﬁlter. Filter\ndesigner should pay special attention to the accelerometer\nresonant frequency, at which its’ maximum sensitivity is\nachieved. These sensors require external supply and their\noutput signal is usually measured in mV so proper gain is\nalso required in the signal acquisition stage.\nB. DIAGNOSTIC DATA PREPROCESSING\nIn the data preprocessing stage, the goal is to transform\nrecorded data in order to facilitate further analysis and com-\nparison. Diagnostic data are usually collected from multi-\nple sensors. Therefore, one should take into account that\nacquired signals should be synchronised. This leads to the\nconclusion that the acquisition system should be designed\nso that it includes reliable trigger sources. Normalisation of\nthe collected data is also very important, as it allows easier\ncomparison. Data preprocessing stage can be roughly divided\ninto the following sequence of steps:\n1) Removing DC offset.\n2) Normalising the amplitude.\n3) Isolating the individual events.\n4) Resampling the signals.\n5) Synchronization of signals.\n6) Signal envelope extraction.\nDC offset can be removed through a high-pass ﬁlter or by\nsubtracting the mean value of the signal from each sample.\n(1) normalises the recorded signal to obtain unit amplitudes:\nxn[k] = x[k]\nmax {|x|}; k ∈{1,..., N}, (1)\nwhere x, x[k], xn[k] are the recorded signal amplitude array\nof N samples, amplitude of the kth sample and the normalised\namplitude of the kth sample, respectively. If the recorded\n83918 VOLUME 7, 2019\nA. Secicet al.: Vibro-Acoustic Methods in the Condition Assessment of Power Transformers\nsignal contains multiple events, e.g. switching between differ-\nent tap positions in OLTC, then it useful to split the recording\ninto multiple signals each corresponding to a certain tap\ntransition, i.e. one signal for transition from tap 0 to tap 1,\none signal for transition from tap 1 to tap 2, etc.\nIf different recording systems with different sampling fre-\nquencies have been used, in order to compare the two signals,\nit is necessary to resample them to a common sampling\nfrequency. One common method of resampling is by using\na rational conversion factor L/M which ﬁrst increases the\nsampling frequency L times and then reduces the sampling\nfrequency M times. L/M is basically a ratio between the\ntwo sampling frequencies. From signal theory, it is known\nthat each of the above steps has to be complemented by an\nappropriate ﬁlter: interpolation ﬁlter and anti-aliasing ﬁlter.\nBlock diagram of such a resampling technique for small\nrational factors is shown in Fig. 4 [27], where L and M\nare the upsampling and downsampling blocks, respectively.\nHI (z) and Hd (z) are interpolation and anti-aliasing ﬁlters,\nrespectively. Fin and Fout are the sampling rate of input and\noutput signal, respectively.\nFIGURE 4. Resampling with a rational conversion factor [27] .\nSince both HI and Hd ﬁlters are cascaded and operate at\nthe same sampling frequency, both of these low-pass ﬁlters\ncan be combined into a single low-pass ﬁlter H(z) with the\nstopband edge frequency equal to (2):\nωsT =max\n{π\nL , π\nM\n}\n. (2)\nIn order to completely synchronise two signals, a discrete\ncross-correlation method can be used (3). Cross-correlation\nis a measure of similarity of two functions and is similar to a\nconvolution of two functions.\n(x1 ∗x2)[n] :=\n∞∑\n−∞\nx∗\n1 [m]x2[m +n], (3)\nwhere x∗\n1 is a complex-conjugate of x1 and m is a discrete\ntime-shift.\nHigh complexity and nonlinearity is observed in the results\nshown in numerous papers dealing with OLTC diagnostics.\nThat is the main reason why researchers attempt to simplify\nthese signals while at the same time trying to keep as much\nuseful diagnostic material as they can. The most common\napproach is the extraction of the signal envelope from the\nanalysed vibration ﬁngerprint. There are several methods that\nallow one to do that. Most commonly used method is the\nHilbert transform [28]. Other noted methods include signal\nsquaring with low pass ﬁltering, usage of TEO, RMS enve-\nlope or Peak envelope using spline interpolation over local\nmaxima separated by at least N samples.\nThe complete OLTC operation for one tap transition usu-\nally takes around a few seconds, while the most interest-\ning diagnostic interval, the one correlated with the OLTC\ndiverter switch operation, usually takes much less (from\n40 ms to 250 ms). As this is a very short period of time, and by\ntaking into consideration OLTC position in relation to other\nelements of the substation, in most cases it is not necessary\nto take into account the impact of other machines on the\ncollected vibration signals. However, it should be noted that\nin the case of audio-based diagnostics, challenges arise with\ntransformer energising because the audio signals will become\ncontaminated by the noise produced by the transformer and\nrelated equipment. The same applies to the analysis of the\nvibration or audio signals gathered from a transformer tank.\nThe interval in which these data are collected is usually much\nlonger and signals can be affected by other machinery. Such\ncases include switching on/off oil pumps, cooling systems,\nOLTC, etc. All these occurrences impact diagnostic signals\nand special care should be taken here.\nC. DATA ANALYSIS AND DECISION STAGE\nAccording to the surveyed literature, two basic approaches\nare used in this stage:\n• the extraction of relevant features from the gathered data\nset and decision making process based on observing\ntheir values in:\n– time domain;\n– frequency domain;\n– time-frequency domain;\n• mathematical modelling and system identiﬁcation fol-\nlowed by the decision-making process based on the\nselected model.\nTherefore, in the following sections these approaches are\nanalysed separately: for both the OLTC and core/windings\ndiagnostics. Table 1 shows a summary of different meth-\nods used for vibroacoustic condition assessment and their\napplications.\nIV. EXTRACTION OF RELEVANT FEATURES\nThe extraction of relevant features leads to reduced data\ndimensionality. It is often necessary to use some kind of\ndecision making process in order to classify the data based on\nthe extracted features. Methods such as PCA can also lead to\nthe additional data dimensionality reduction. Sejdic et al. [29]\nhave organised feature extraction and decision making using\nsignal processing techniques according to Fig. 5.\nHere, a classiﬁcation of feature extraction methods in\nthree subgroups has been made, depending on the domain in\nwhich the collected data are analysed. The reader will notice\nthat various signal processing techniques (e.g. Wavelet and\nFourier transforms, TEO, HHT, etc.) are often used in the\nsurveyed literature and therefore they are often mentioned\nthroughout this text. No special introduction to these tech-\nniques will be written because it is beyond the scope of this\npaper, however the reader is referred to the following litera-\nture [28], [30]–[34] or any other signal processing textbook.\nVOLUME 7, 2019 83919\nA. Secicet al.: Vibro-Acoustic Methods in the Condition Assessment of Power Transformers\nTABLE 1. Comparison of used methods for vibro-acoustic condition assessment.\nFIGURE 5. Signal processing techniques for feature extraction and\ndecision making [29].\nA. TIME DOMAIN\nThe length of recorded signals from OLTC, as well as\ntheir shape, allows extraction of some diagnostic features\nby observing these signals only in the time domain. On the\nother hand, signals recorded from the transformer tank usu-\nally require some kind of transformation which allows easier\nfeature extraction.\n1) OLTC\nThe ﬁrst experiences in this ﬁeld were described in [35]–[38].\nIn addition to the OLTC vibration signals, the motor cur-\nrent was also recorded which was used for triggering the\nrecording device. What was perceived here is that mechanical\nand electrical events manifest themselves through signals\nin completely different frequency bands—electrical events,\nsuch as the appearance of an electric arc, are associated with\nhigher frequencies, while mechanical events, such as friction\nand synchronisation problems, are associated with lower fre-\nquencies. High complexity of the acoustic ﬁngerprint was\nnoted, so the authors resorted to envelope extraction using\nthe Hilbert transform. To separate electrical and mechanical\nevents, this transform was performed on two different data\nsets separated. It was suggested that the decision stage should\nbe based on the comparison between new and previously\nobtained records (online testing) or on the comparison of\nrecords without any OLTC load (ofﬂine testing). Combina-\ntion of both methods was suggested as the best practice. It is\npossible to draw some conclusions this way, but this method\nrequires experienced and knowledgeable testing personnel,\nwhich is usually not the case in the ﬁeld. It is precisely\nwhy such requirements have led to the further evolution of\nthe diagnostic methods towards smarter systems that would\nenable easier detection of potential issues.\nDWT and TEO were used in [39]–[41] for envelope\nextraction to reduce complexity after collecting the vibra-\ntion ﬁngerprint. Properties derived from the auto-correlation\nfunction were used as input parameters for Self-Organising\nMaps (SOMs), which is a type of an artiﬁcial neural net-\nwork used to classify and organise data. Experience showed\nthat vibration ﬁngerprint varies for each OLTC tap position\nand SOMs automatically classify the data according to their\nsimilarities. A priori knowledge was used to train the SOMs\nto carry out this automatic data classiﬁcation. This principle\nimplies that a large number of tests should be carried out\non the objects that are in the healthy as well as those in the\nfaulty state. Moreover, for objects that are in the faulty state,\none should have a priori knowledge about the type of defect\npresent. Five different OLTC conditions were observed that\nwere used as classiﬁers in the SOMs:\n• normal condition;\n• weak springs;\n• worn moving contacts;\n• worn moving and ﬁxed contacts;\n• weak springs plus worn contacts.\nMoreover, it was noticed that an alteration of OLTC condition\nis most often a gradual process rather than a sudden change.\nCrossing the deﬁned threshold value of OLTC condition cri-\nterion activates an alarm that something is wrong. The main\n83920 VOLUME 7, 2019\nA. Secicet al.: Vibro-Acoustic Methods in the Condition Assessment of Power Transformers\npurpose of the design was to avoid false alarms. This design\nwas successfully tested on a system that was in operation for\nthree years at the time.\nIn [42], experiments were conducted on a transformer that\nwas removed from the operation, so the authors were able\nto record vibration ﬁngerprints for all 10 OLTC tap posi-\ntions. Hilbert transform and a low-pass ﬁlter with a cut-off\nfrequency based on Kolmogorov’s complexity measure were\nused for signal envelope extraction. As there was no reference\nvibration ﬁngerprint for the tested OLTC, one way to perform\ndiagnostics is to compare different tap positions. The goal\nis to ﬁnd a tap position that is most correlated with all the\nothers. Finding such a position allows the comparison of the\nvibration ﬁngerprint for each individual tap positions with\nthat one. By doing so, the authors concluded that there are\nsome differences between tap positions caused by their fre-\nquent use. This approach can be used to perform diagnostics\nin cases when measurement history is not available. However,\nit should also be noted that some OLTC tap positions are\nused more than others, which also implies that their wear will\nbe more pronounced and all this will cause the differences\nbetween their vibration ﬁngerprints.\nSecic and Kuzle [43] proposed a diagnostic method based\non signal fractal properties. Higuchi’s algorithm was used\non a signal envelope of a simulated OLTC vibration model\nfrom [44] to estimate the fractal dimension of the signal.\nBy changing the model parameters, contact ageing was sim-\nulated and the results showed increasing differences between\nthe estimated fractal dimension of a new and old OLTC\ncontacts. This method can be used for diagnosing contact\ndegradation and to distinguish between different mounting\nmethods. However, no validation on OLTC contacts whose\ncondition is a priori known has been conducted nor was the\nproposed algorithm tested for OLTC failure detection.\n2) CORE/WINDINGS\nA diagnostic technique based on time domain analysis of\nvibration stationarity was proposed in [45]. Vibration sta-\ntionarity analysis is based on recurrence plot analysis where\nrecurrence means a time in which the trajectory returns to a\nlocation it has visited before. System determinism is chosen\nas the transformer health criterion which is deﬁned as the\nratio of recurrence points that form diagonal structures to all\nrecurrence points. The authors state that the system determin-\nism value of a healthy transformer should be close to 1.\nB. FREQUENCY DOMAIN\nVibration ﬁngerprints obtained from OLTC display a non-\nstationary character and very high complexity. Frequency\nanalysis therefore may not be the best tool for the analy-\nsis of these processes. Nevertheless, several authors have\napproached the problem from this perspective.\n1) OLTC\nIn the frequency domain analysis of vibro-acoustic ﬁnger-\nprints of an OLTC, three papers have been found which\ndiffer in the type of decision making process utilized for the\ndetection of the OLTC condition.\nRastgoufard et al. [24] observed sufﬁcient differences\nbetween contacts in good and bad condition by observing the\nfrequency spectrum of vibration signals recorded by strain\ngauge sensors mounted on the main drive arm of OLTC.\nAutomatic detection of the OLTC condition was achieved\nwith unsupervised fuzzy logic.\nBhuyan et al. [46] measured the dynamic resistance of\nOLTC contacts alongside the OLTC vibration ﬁngerprint.\nThe authors manually identiﬁed ﬁve different regions in the\nfrequency spectrum using FFT which are separately used to\ndistinguish contacts in good and bad shape, and contacts with\nincreased electrical arcing. They showed that it is possible\nto recognise arcing and various defects in a single phase tap\nchanger.\nHussain et al. [47] measured the OLTC motor current\nalongside the OLTC vibration ﬁngerprint. An automatic\nexpert diagnostic system was designed based on these signals\nand a knowledge database based on ﬁeld experience. The\nmain purpose of this system is to solve complex problems\nthrough reasoning based on a set of rules which minimises\nerrors that can be caused by human factors in the decision\nmaking process.\n2) CORE/WINDINGS\nSigniﬁcantly more papers deal with transformer core/\nwindings vibration analysis in the frequency domain [10],\n[16], [17], [48]–[55]. Here, their conclusions and contribu-\ntions are summarised.\nCore/windings vibrations appear at multiple frequencies\nup to several kHz and the magnitudes of those frequency\ncomponents are dependant on the external temperature. These\nfrequencies appear as even, odd and rational multiples of\nthe fundamental frequency and generally the most dominant\ncomponents are 100 Hz and its integer multiples. Vibra-\ntions are highly correlated with the transformer loading and\n100 Hz, 200 Hz and 300 Hz components are most sensitive\nto the loading of the transformer. Vibrations with frequen-\ncies <100 Hz are usually the product of cooling systems\nand oil pumps operation. Core vibrations caused by magne-\ntostriction are non-linearly proportional to the applied voltage\nwhile the winding vibrations are non-linearly proportional\nto the current. Munir et al. [48] reported the dependency of\nvibrations to the square of the current, while Aidi et al. [52]\nfound that the nonlinear properties of the insulation between\nthe windings make the relation closer to the cubic represen-\ntation. To separate the core (magnetostriction) and windings\n(Lorentz forces) vibrations it is best to do the measurements\nunder no-load and under normal loading conditions [17]\nbecause the vibrations under normal loading are caused\nby both of those phenomena. Guo et al. [53] showed that\neven multiples of fundamental frequency harmonics appear\nunder fastened core and odd multiples under slack core.\nOdd harmonics appear both under fastened and loose wind-\nings, but the intensity is different between the two cases.\nVOLUME 7, 2019 83921\nA. Secicet al.: Vibro-Acoustic Methods in the Condition Assessment of Power Transformers\nSome guidelines regarding the core/windings vibration mea-\nsurements were also deﬁned in several papers [16], [17], [52]:\n• reduction of the external noise can be achieved by:\ninsulation between the sensor shell and the transformer’s\ntank, shielding of the transmission cables and grounding\nof the measurement system;\n• noise from the power supply lines can inﬂuence the\nmeasurements;\n• measurement points should have a high correlation with\nthe load current to better reﬂect vibration characteristics\nof the windings;\n• when arranging the measurement points, one should take\ninto account the structural features and ﬂat surfaces of\nthe transformer for better signals;\n• stiffeners or other complex structures should be avoided;\n• the sum of ﬁrst four harmonics, the total harmonic dis-\ntortion and the ratio between the amplitudes of the 50 Hz\nand 100 Hz harmonic are sufﬁcient to establish good\ndiagnostics and the estimation of the remaining service\nlife of the transformer;\n• best mounting position is at the top of the transformer\noil tank with auxiliary measurement point at the side of\nthe tank.\nLi et al. [56] tackled the issues concerning laboratory\ntesting due to the restrictions on the available power in the\nlaboratory, but also the inability to dissipate large amounts\nof energy. They suggested a setup consisting of a current\nlimiting resistor, a voltage regulator and a universal trans-\nformer whose LV side is connected to the LV side of the tested\ntransformer.\nHong et al. [45] presented several health metrics based on\nDFT decomposition in the frequency domain.\nAs it was mentioned earlier in this paper, mounting\nmethod of an accelerometer impacts its frequency response.\nAdditionally, the accelerometer is in direct contact with\na high voltage objects and therefore it must be properly\nshielded from electromagnetic interference. This is why\nZheng et al. [57] used a laser Doppler vibrometer to study the\nvibration of the windings. Four cases were studied: normal\noperating condition, different clamping pressures, loose insu-\nlation blocks and loose core clamping. Several conclusions\nhave been drawn:\n• radial vibration pattern of a healthy transformer is\napproximately bilaterally symmetric, while the radial\nvibration pattern of a transformer with faulty windings\nbecomes asymmetric;\n• looseness of winding clamping pressures or insulation\nblock looseness are manifested as a change in vibration\npatterns at dominant frequencies;\n• looseness in core clamping pressure doesn’t affect the\nvibration pattern as much so the spatial variance cannot\nbe used to determine the severity of the core looseness,\nbut it is still detectable by observing the winding vibra-\ntion distribution.\nVery interesting observations were given in [26], [54],\nand [55]. These papers analyse the impact of geomagnetically\ninduced currents and coupling effects between nearby AC\nand HVDC transmission lines on transformer vibrations. The\nSun emits solar wind, which is basically low-density plasma\nthat consists mostly of electrons, protons and alpha particles.\nThese charged particles travel through the earth’s atmosphere,\ncausing variations in the intensity of the electrical ﬁeld and\ncreating a DC that can ﬂow through the transformer’s neutral.\nA similar effect is created by surrounding single-pole HVDC\nsystems with the earth as a return conductor. The ﬂow of\nDC causes increased magnetostriction, and may also lead\nto saturation of the transformer. Increased magnetostriction\ncauses an increase of vibration intensity and additional losses\nthrough the occurrence of higher harmonics and reduction\nof reactive power. The conclusions of these studies are the\nfollowing:\n• 50 Hz component is present in the measured signal in the\ncase when there is a DC ﬂowing through the transformer\nneutral. This component is not present when there is no\nneutral current;\n• amplitudes of the second and fourth harmonics increase\nas the DC increases;\n• the shape and the intensity of the vibration ﬁngerprint is\nsigniﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the DC;\n• frequency analysis has shown shifting of the dominant\nharmonic and appearance of higher harmonics when the\nDC exists;\n• authors propose monitoring additional inputs for condi-\ntion assessment of the transformer: transformer load and\nDC through neutral.\nC. TIME-FREQUENCY DOMAIN\nThis approach is mostly used in the analysis of the vibration\nsignals gained from the OLTC that show high non-stationary\nbehaviour. By observing such signals, one can state that\nFourier analysis is not the best processing technique, not even\nthe STFT, which by the introduction of the time window\nlocalises the Fourier transform of function f (t) around the\ninstant of time t =u where the function can be considered\nstationary. Because of the character of the recorded signal,\nthe used time window should be very narrow in order to\nconsider this process stationary around the point t = u.\nThe problem lies in the unavoidable Heisenberg uncertainty\nprinciple, which associates the width of the time window\nwith the maximal width of the window in the frequency\ndomain. The narrowing of the time window inevitably leads\nto the expansion of this window in the frequency domain,\nand to greater uncertainty in deﬁning the frequency content\nor the complete loss of information (presence of a lower\nfrequency). On the other hand, a too wide time window\nleads to a loss in precision. This is the reason why wavelet\ntransform is used, in which the time window length is based\non the appropriate frequency. This approach allows for an\nincrease of the resolution while still satisfying the Heisenberg\nuncertainty principle. The selection of the optimal mother\nwavelet (kernel wavelet) plays a great role in the application\nof the wavelet transform. Several developed methods are\n83922 VOLUME 7, 2019\nA. Secicet al.: Vibro-Acoustic Methods in the Condition Assessment of Power Transformers\nbased on the similarity of the observed signal and the mother\nwavelet. However, some studies show that such an approach\nis not always optimal. This is why several other techniques\nhave been developed in order to get to the best solution,\ne.g. second generation Wavelets [58], which avoid eventual\nproblems regarding the selection of the mother wavelet.\n1) OLTC\nCWT was used in [59]–[63] for the feature extraction from\nthe OLTC vibration ﬁngerprint. Kang and Birtwhistle [40]\ndid a ﬁeld evaluation over a period of three years with\nSOMs for data classiﬁcation. They identiﬁed the establish-\nment of reference vibration ﬁngerprint as a practical problem\nin order to apply the monitoring system on a different OLTC.\nViereck and Saveliev [63] showed several time-frequency\nimages of the OLTC switching operation where different\nphenomena were clearly marked such as: preselector and\ndiverter switch operation; transformer buzzing and 50 Hz\ndisturbances of an energised transformer; impact of sensor\nmounting method; tap selector squeaking anomaly.\nDWT was used in [18] and [64]–[68]. Based on the\nresearch conducted in [64] and [65], several accomplishments\nwere pointed out by the authors:\n• ability to differ between new and old (used) contacts;\n• distinguishing vibration ﬁngerprints of different tap\npositions;\n• distinguishing between the following types of failures:\nloose contact springs, broken contact bar, worn out tap\nselector contacts and damaged tap selector contacts.\nFilho and de Almeida [66] used SOMs for data classiﬁcation\nto group data into 6 different clusters based on the wear level,\nfaulty condition, etc. The main advantage of this method is\nthat it provides information on the gradual degradation of the\ncontacts condition, and that such info can be used by an online\nmonitoring system.\nIn [68], besides OLTC vibration, a high frequency current\ntransducer was used for measurement of the arcing signal for\nimproved diagnostics. This signal was used as an additional\ndiagnostic information that helps to clearly identify events\nin the OLTC switching operation that are manifested in the\nvibration ﬁngerprint. Modiﬁed form of wavelet transform,\ncalled Probabilistic Wavelet Transform (PWT) [69] was used\nfor segmenting arcing signals and noise.\nBesides the obviously popular wavelet transform, several\npapers were found in which time-frequency domain was\nused but in which the authors approached the matter dif-\nferently [9], [20], [21], [70]–[73]—the following methods\nor their combinations have been used or mentioned: EMD,\nHilbert Transform, HHT, HSA, EEMD, BREMD, MFEMD.\nThese methods were used to tackle the problems of highly\nnon-stationary nature of the signals and to improve the pre-\ncision of the diagnostics. CWT, DWT and STFT have also\nbeen used in [20], [21], [71], and [72] for the extraction of\nthe diagnostic material. Li et al. [73] reported the shortcom-\nings of the existing vibro-acoustic diagnostic methods when\nelectrical faults without obvious mechanical vibration are\nbeing diagnosed, such as contact terminals fault and contact\nresistance anomaly. They proposed a method based on mea-\nsuring the current waveform of an OLTC, for which they state\nit contains rich diagnostic information. Two faulty OLTCs\nhave been analysed and their time-frequency spectrum shows\nrich frequency content compared to a healthy OLTC whose\nwaveform is mainly composed of 50 Hz component.\nFIGURE 6. Field setup of condenser microphones for recording the OLTC\naudio signature.\nSo far, all the surveyed research used accelerometers or\nAE sensors which require direct contact with the transformer\nor must be put inside the tank in the case of hydrophones.\nFrom our experience, the audio-based diagnostics is a rel-\natively unresearched area which in our opinion is worth\nexploring. A method of recording the audio signal of the\nOLTC using an array of condenser microphones (Fig. 6) was\ntested in [74]–[76]. These papers deal with the extraction of\nthe useful diagnostic material from a mixture of different\naudio signals and correlating audio signature with a vibra-\ntion signature. Fast Independent Component Analysis Blind\nSource Separation (FastICA-BSS) was used to separate the\nuseful diagnostic material from the surrounding noise. Some\ndistortion in the estimated signal is unavoidable, and the real\nquestion is if this distortion will prevent diagnostic infor-\nmation extraction method in performing its task and how\nmuch it will affect the results. Using proper data extraction\ntechniques and comparing original and estimated signals or\nusing the OLTC reference audio ﬁngerprint recorded in the\nde-energised state are some ways to tackle this issue.\n2) CORE/WINDINGS\nClassical ICA-based BSS recovers the different physical\nsources of a system given a set of external measurements\nassuming statistical independence of the sources. However,\nsources of transformer vibrations are highly correlated due to\nthe mutual dependence of voltage (core) and current (wind-\nings). Therefore, Jing et al. [77] proposed a modiﬁed BSS\nalgorithm named TIFROM-BSS (Time-frequency ratio of\nmixtures—blind source separation) which was used to sep-\narate the core and windings vibrations.\nHHT was also used in [78] and [79], but in these papers\nit was applied on vibration signals obtained from the trans-\nformer tank. Xiong and Ji [78] concluded that for healthy\nVOLUME 7, 2019 83923\nA. Secicet al.: Vibro-Acoustic Methods in the Condition Assessment of Power Transformers\nFIGURE 7. Fundamental frequency vibration variation between two\nsamples [88].\ntransformers dominant frequencies in the Hilbert spectrum\nare 100 Hz, 200 Hz and 400 Hz, while for defected\ntransformers the intensity of LF and HF components is\nampliﬁed and for medium frequencies (oscillations around\n400 Hz) it is decreased. These differences increase as the\ntransformer defect is greater—the looser the core’s clamp\nbolt is, the greater the frequency and energy content. In [79],\nbefore implementation of HHT, Wavelet Packet Decompo-\nsition (WPD) was used to minimise noise inﬂuence and\nto remove unwanted components from the signal. HHT is\nmuch more effective when it is preceded by WPD since in\nthat case it is much easier to spot dominant frequencies and\ntheir time distribution. Hilbert spectrum showed dominant\nfrequencies that are integer multiples of fundamental system\nfrequency (50 Hz). Basically, the time-frequency domain\napproach shows similar frequency content to the one in papers\nin which the authors used pure frequency approach. How-\never, this method probably has an advantage over the pure\nfrequency approach as the time dependent frequency content\ncan be observed along with the load variations in time.\nIn [80], a transient method was proposed in which the\nvibration signals are collected during switching the trans-\nformer from ofﬂine to idle mode. Aside normal operating\ncondition, three more cases were studied: core with loose\nscrews ﬁxing the upper yoke, core with loose screws ﬁxing\nboth upper and lower yokes and core with loose screws\nﬁxing both yokes with simultaneous reduction of HV wind-\nings’ clamping pressure. The advantages of this method are:\nimmunity to loading current magnitude, signiﬁcant inde-\npendence between the vibro-acoustic signals and the type,\npower and construction technology of the transformer, elimi-\nnation of disturbances from oil and air circulation appliances,\ninsigniﬁcant inﬂuence of transducer mounting position. The\ndownside of this method is that the transformer must be out of\nservice, but this time is only around 10 minutes compared to\nseveral hours needed for ofﬂine diagnostics. The aforemen-\ntioned defects can be easily discerned in the time-frequency\nspectrogram since each defect has idiosyncratic amplitudes\nand dominant harmonics.\nV. MATHEMATICAL MODELLING AND\nSYSTEM IDENTIFICATION\nDynamic model of a system can be created either by knowing\nthe physical description of the system or through a technique\ncalled system identiﬁcation by using a predeﬁned model\nstructure (linear, nonlinear, time-variant/invariant, black box,\ngrey box) and observed data (i.e. measurements of input\nand output signals). System identiﬁcation is a widely used\ntechnique in online condition monitoring systems.\nThe condition monitoring system uses this model through\nthe simulation process to generate reference outputs that can\nbe compared to the outputs of the real system, under the\nsame input conditions. If the identiﬁcation procedure was\ncarried out correctly and the model parameters match the real\nsystem, then high deviation between output of the mathemat-\nical model and real system should trigger alarm activation\nbecause this means that for some reason the system is not\nbehaving the way it is supposed to. For basic overview of\nsystem identiﬁcation, the reader is referred to [81]–[84].\nA. OLTC\nIn [44] and [85], OLTC vibration ﬁngerprint was modelled as\na second-order spring-damper system (4):\nmd2x(t)\ndt2 +cdx(t)\ndt +kx(t) =0, (4)\nwhere, x(t), m, c and k are the linear displacement, mass,\ndamping factor and spring constant, respectively. System\nexhibits an underdamped behaviour and a sum of three under-\ndamped sine waves was used to approximate the vibration\nsignals (5):\na(t) =\n3∑\ni=1\nAie−αi(t−t0i) cos(ωi(t −t0i)), (5)\nwhere a(t), Ai, αi, t0i are the vibration signal estimate,\namplitude, damping coefﬁcient and time delay (phase shift),\nrespectively. The authors reported that using less than 3 sine\nwaves is not precise enough and for more than 3, the algo-\nrithm becomes too slow without signiﬁcant improvements\nTABLE 2. Categorisation of the vibro-acoustic diagnostic techniques.\n83924 VOLUME 7, 2019\nA. Secicet al.: Vibro-Acoustic Methods in the Condition Assessment of Power Transformers\nTABLE 3. Taxonomy of the OLTC diagnostics literature.\nin precision. Following signal preprocessing, estimated\nparameters were amplitude, damping coefﬁcient and the\nphase shift with minimisation of mean square error as the\ncriterion (objective function). Genetic algorithm was used\nfor optimisation of the criterion in [44] while Prony’s anal-\nysis was used in [85]. Both of these methods have a low\ncomputational cost. However, it is noted in [85] that some\ncontacts operate only a few times during their life cycle and\nin such cases Prony’s method may not be able to establish\ngood diagnostics.\nChaos theory was used for OLTC diagnostics in both [86]\nand [87] for distinguishing contacts with weak spring condi-\ntion from those in good condition. For practical application,\nexternal inﬂuences such as temperature and load variations\nwill affect the results, and they should also be taken into\naccount.\nVOLUME 7, 2019 83925\nA. Secicet al.: Vibro-Acoustic Methods in the Condition Assessment of Power Transformers\nTABLE 4. Taxonomy of the transformer core/windings diagnostics literature.\nB. CORE/WINDINGS\nConstruction of a numerical model based on aforementioned\nspring damper concept was used to monitor tank vibra-\ntions in [6], [7], [89]. Basically, the used model was quite\nsimple—it was constructed as the sum of the vibrations\ncaused by the transformer core (proportional to applied volt-\nage squared) and windings (proportional to load current\nsquared). An additional variable was used to take into account\ntemperature inﬂuence.

The proposed model was\nexperimentally validated on a real system in [7]. A deforma-\ntion of the transformer winding lead to a signiﬁcant increase\nin model error.\nJing et al. [90] and Hong et al. [91] use standard\nHammerstein-Wiener model type for nonlinear systems.\nThese models are often used for systems where the input-\noutput relationship can be decomposed into serial connection\nof static nonlinear input-output blocks and a dynamic linear\nblock. Identiﬁcation of the model parameters in [91] was\ndone with a neural network. By using a neural network, it is\npossible to have less a priori knowledge of the system and\nthat nonlinearity does not need to be predeﬁned.\nWinding condition assessment based on principal com-\nponent analysis was proposed in [45] and [88] using the\nmathematical model of transformer core/winding vibrations\nfrom [6], [7]. Total vibration depends on the power factor\nbetween the fundamental voltage and current [45], [88], [89],\nthus the currents and voltages must be treated as complex\nvariables. In practice, if the power factor angle ﬂuctuation is\nless than 0.02 radians, the transformer current is the only fac-\ntor that contributes to the total winding variation. Therefore,\ntwo close samples of transformer vibrations can be used to\nseparate the winding vibration from the total vibration. This\nprinciple is illustrated in Fig. 7, where vtotal,i, vcore,i, vwinding,i\nare the total vibration signal, core and winding vibration sig-\nnals of sample i, respectively. The winding vibration variation\nfrom sample i to sample i +1 is denoted with 1vw and βis\nthe phase angle between the total vibration signals i and i+1.\nWinding vibration variation can then be expressed as (7):\n1vw =\n√\nv2\ntotal,i +v2\ntotal,i+1 −2vtotal,ivtotal,i+1 cos β. (7)\nWorks [92]–[95] deal with the electromagnetic vibration\nnoise analysis of core and windings of a power transformer\nusing ﬁnite element modelling. Additionally, Hu et al. [92]\nand Bouayed et al. [93] combined electromagnetic ﬁeld anal-\nysis with mechanical ﬁeld analysis and acoustic analysis.\nFFT analysis of the electromagnetic forces has shown that\nthe most prominent harmonics are again 100 and 200 Hz,\nrespectively. Furthermore, the core magnetostriction depends\nonly on the magnetic induction and that the frequency of core\nmagnetostriction is twice as that of the magnetic induction,\ni.e. twice the fundamental grid frequency.\nVI. SUMMARY\nSurveyed literature is categorised in Table 2 according to\nthe type of analysis (time domain, frequency domain, time-\nfrequency domain or mathematical modelling and system\nidentiﬁcation) and according to the observed transformer\nelement (OLTC or core/windings). Note that some works\nalso fall into multiple categories when more than one anal-\nysis technique has been used. Taxonomies of the OLTC and\ncore/windings diagnostic techniques are given in Table 3 and\nTable 4, respectively.\nVII. CONCLUDING REMARKS\nThis paper provides an overview of the current state-of-the-art\nin vibro-acoustic condition monitoring of power transformers\nwith the focus on OLTC and transformers’ winding/core\ndiagnostics which are three elements that are responsible for\nover 70% of the all transformer failures according to the\ninternational statistics.\nNon-invasive diagnostics are superior over the classical\napproach as it doesn’t interfere with the regular operation of\nthe object being tested. This opens a possibility of implemen-\ntation of the continuous monitoring systems that will provide\ninsights into the health condition of the monitored equipment\nat any moment, or inform about potential failure before it\neven happens. It can also provide the ongoing maintenance\nrecommendations. In this sense, the logical choice is the\ncapturing and analysis of the audio and vibrating signals\nproduced by the tested object during its regular mode of\noperation. For that reason, this paper paid special attention to\nrecent advancements in audio and vibration signal processing\ntechniques and decision making processes whose complexity,\nbut also the reliability is increasing with the advancements in\nresearch and development.\nAudio/vibration-based diagnostics can contribute to the\nsafety of test personnel and to the reduction of the labour\ncosts. If these methods really prove effective, they will be\nwelcomed by the utilities. However, it cannot be said that\nthere is no resistance in adapting these methods in the ﬁeld.\nThe nature of this resistance can sometimes be rational. For\ninstance, some utilities are not ready for big investments in\nthe condition monitoring systems, but will rather turn to the\nshort term solutions which can include engagement of the\nexternal consultants for one-time condition assessment of\ntheir currently installed equipment. Sometimes, these reasons\ncan also be totally irrational. Engineers who are used to one\nway of thinking are often reluctant to change their habits.\nWhen asked about his opinion on online monitoring systems,\nthe head of the test department in one of the big utilities\nin USA (with 20+ years of experience in diagnostics and\ntesting) gave an interesting answer: ‘‘I don’t want to spend\nmy time testing a monster that tests the monster’’, showing\nthe complete distrust in the continuous monitoring systems,\ntheir communication channels, and the decision processes\nbased on the artiﬁcial intelligence. He also believes that\nthe human factor and its experience are still inevitable in\nterms of making decisions. Likewise, ﬁeld engineers are just\naccustomed to the on-site diagnostics that can provide instant\ninformation about the need to conduct maintenance and the\ninstant info on the possibility of re-commissioning after the\nmaintenance procedure. From all of the above, it’s easy to\nVOLUME 7, 2019 83927\nA. Secicet al.: Vibro-Acoustic Methods in the Condition Assessment of Power Transformers\nconclude that online monitoring systems will not be able to\nsuppress classic diagnostic methods for a long time. However,\nthe two approaches to the object condition assessment do not\nnecessarily have to compete with each other. They may also\ncomplement each other, which will eventually lead to greater\nreliability and lower the risk of possible failures.\nThe combination of invasive and non-invasive diagnos-\ntic methods is already used, even in the ofﬂine monitoring\napproach. A typical example is the simultaneous measure-\nment of the OLTC dynamic resistance and the vibration sig-\nnals which is already implemented in some solutions. The\nlast option for utilities is always disassembling the tested\nobject. Therefore, any conﬁrmation that leads to a better\nunderstanding of the health of the tested object is always\nwelcomed. In terms of ofﬂine condition assessment, the goal\nis to spend as little time as possible in the test ﬁeld. For\nthat reason, in case of an ofﬂine test, we believe that the\naudio-based diagnostics can contribute to a faster test setup,\nas it doesn’t require any connection with the object being\ntested. In addition to avoiding problems that may result\nfrom poor contact of the sensor with the test object, audio-\nbased diagnostics allow greater location possibilities and\neven the possibility of recording the signals from a certain\ndistance. We also believe that audio-based diagnostics could\nalso enable ‘‘easily portable’’ recording systems that could be\nused for collecting the diagnostic material only for a certain\nperiod of time from one object during its regular exploitation\nafter which the recording system can be easily transferred to\nanother location. This can be seen as a much cheaper alterna-\ntive to permanently installed monitoring systems. However,\nthere are still some challenges in audio-based diagnostics that\nneed to be overcome. These challenges are reﬂected in the\nunavoidable inﬂuence of the machine environment which is\nreﬂected through a mixture of the useful diagnostic material\nwith surrounding sounds. However, the rapid development\nof the source separation techniques is promising and will\ncertainly contribute to the application of these methods in the\nfuture.\nEvery diagnostic procedure must be followed by a good\nunderstanding of the physical processes that are taking place\nboth within and around the test object. Good diagnostics\nimply not only the analysis of the signals, feature extrac-\ntion and their classiﬁcation, but also the understanding why\nsomething happens at a certain point in time and what could\ncause such phenomena. Therefore, simulation models that\ndescribe physical processes can greatly help in their under-\nstanding. Various computer programs that allow these kinds\nof simulations evolve daily and greatly facilitate this task. The\nobvious development of the signal processing techniques is\nreﬂected in the analysis of the acoustic signals in transform-\ners’ condition assessment. The evolution of these techniques\nallows the extraction of the features from signals that express\na highly non-stationary behaviour. The same applies to future\nclassiﬁcation and pattern recognition methods. The obvious\nproblem is the lack of the relevant ﬁngerprints for different\ntransformer/OLTC types. One way to increase the reliability\nof the already developed diagnostic methods and the future\ndevelopments is to establish the relevant acoustic signature\ndatabase that could be used by researchers and the utilities.\nThat way the performance comparison between different\nmethods could lead to the adaptation of the most reliable\ntechniques. This obviously requires collaboration between\nthe researchers and the industry.\nVIII. WHAT DOES THE FUTURE HOLD?\nWe can not talk about the future without mentioning the ﬁfth\ngeneration (5G) cellular network technology that provides\nbroadband access. Wireless data transfer at speeds exceeding\n1 Gbps at very low latency rates opens up a whole new\nspectrum of possibilities. 5G will also have a big impact on\nmachinery diagnostics. Although there is already a possibility\nof rapid transmission of large amounts of data and their\nstorage in the cloud, 5G will simply standardise the approach\nand impose itself as an unavoidable factor in many ﬁelds.\nGreater connectivity and data access from various remote\nlocations will allow experts to share their experiences and\nrevolutionise the diagnostic process.\nFor this reason, methods of collecting data which will not\ninterfere with the regular operation of the transformer, OLTC\nor any other test object, such as those based on audio and\nvibration signal measurements, will become more and more\ninteresting. Obviously, with the amount of the data being\ncollected, big data and cloud computing are the technologies\nthat will dominate the next decade in the ﬁeld of diagnos-\ntics. The artiﬁcial intelligence will also become an inevitable\nfactor in decision-making processes. Rapid development and\nprogress of neural networks and deep learning comes at the\nright moment and will deﬁnitely have a big impact on future\ndevelopments.\nIn any case, one interesting and exciting period is ahead\nof us.\nREFERENCES\n[1] G.
