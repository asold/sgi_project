    "abstract": "In the following narrative review, we discuss the potential role of large language models (LLMs) in medical device innovation, specifically examples using generative pretrained transformer-4. Throughout the biodesign process, LLMs can offer prompt-driven insights, aiding problem identification, knowledge assimilation and decision-making. Intellectual property analysis, regulatory assessment and market analysis emerge as key LLM applications. Through case examples, we underscore LLMs’ transformative ability to democratise information access and expertise, facilitating inclusive innovation in medical devices as well as its effectiveness with providing real-time, individualised feedback for innovators of all experience levels. By mitigating entry barriers, LLMs accelerate transformative advancements, fostering collaboration among established and emerging stakeholders.",
