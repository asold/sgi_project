In addition, the Internet of Things can with -\nstand the power emergency in negative weather and improve the disaster resistance abil-\nity of the communication system. The Internet of Things will become an important way \nfor the rapid development of information technology in the future.\nDi Renzo’s research relied on modeling the location of the base station as the points \nof spatial Poisson point process, and carries out system level analysis by using ran -\ndom geometry. The trade-off between wireless information and power transmission \nis described by the concept of \"feasible region,\" and quantified by the joint cumula -\ntive distribution function of average power and average rate. Di Renzo proposed a new \nmathematical method to analyze and optimize cellular low-energy mobile devices with \nwireless information and power transmission capabilities. The method is ingenious, but \nrequires high accuracy, and needs to be improved in practical application [1]. In order to \nreduce the difficulty of data acquisition and transmission in the fault diagnosis system \nof mine hoist, and solve the problems of low efficiency of fault diagnosis and unreason -\nable reasoning process of mine hoist, a fault diagnosis method of mine hoist equipment \nbased on Internet of Things is proposed. Based on ZigBee short-range wireless com -\nmunication technology, the collaborative acquisition system of key components of mine \nhoisting equipment is designed in the Internet of Things. Juanli adopted remote wireless \ngeneral packet radio service (GPRS) transmission mode to realize real-time data acqui -\nsition and network layer establishment. Juanli through the fault diagnosis test of mine \nhoist, the diagnosis method obtains complete diagnosis data, and the diagnosis result of \nthis method has high accuracy and reliability [2]. Qian designed a relay with dual inter -\nface of wireless and PLC, which connects PLC and wireless sensor into an Internet of \nThings network. In addition, the dual interface relay adaptively selects the interface to \nforward the message according to the channel state. Qian proposed a general mathe -\nmatical model of the dual interface relay protection system. According to the statistical \ncharacteristics of PLC and wireless channel, Qian derived the probability density func -\ntion of output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Qian’s research has constructed the general \nmathematical model of double interface relay protection system. This method has high \naccuracy, but lacks feasibility [3]. Zikria connected the digital and physical worlds by \ncombining energy-efficient microcontrollers, low-power transceivers, sensors, and actu -\nators in so-called \"small objects.\" In general, intelligent objects are severely limited in \ncomputing, memory and energy resources. New verification methods and experimen -\ntal tools are needed to study the intelligent object network, new software platform is \nneeded to operate intelligent objects effectively, and innovative network models and \nprotocols are needed to interconnect intelligent objects. Zikria’s research connected the \ndigital world with the physical world, which has many innovations, but needs more veri -\nfication methods to support the accuracy of the research data [4].\nIn this paper, a total of 30 groups of transformer fault samples are selected, and 10 \ngroups are randomly selected for network training, and the remaining samples are used \nfor testing. The transformer fault diagnosis system model is established for each group of \npower transformers for four consecutive months, and the monitoring data and diagnosis \nresults are recorded and analyzed. The communication network uses GPRS to realize \nthe communication between the data acquisition terminal and the monitoring terminal. \nPage 3 of 24\nWang et al. J Wireless Com Network         (2021) 2021:21 \n \nAccording to the parameters of the sample library, the working state of the equipment is \nset, and various sensors are controlled by the instrument driver module to complete the \ndetection of the transformer fault system. The results show that the detection success \nrate of the power transformer fault diagnosis using this model is as high as 95.6, and the \ntraining error is less than 0.0001, and it can accurately identify the fault types of the sam-\nples in the non training set.\n2  Principle about Internet of Things and fault diagnosis system\n2.1  Internet of Things\n1. Combination of Internet of Things technology and smart grid\nSince its successful development, the Internet of Things has undergone many signifi -\ncant changes. From the logistics network mainly relying on radio frequency identifica -\ntion technology at the beginning, it has now been studied that a variety of information \nsensing equipment relying on Internet technology, sensing technology and computer \ntechnology can use Internet facilities for information exchange, coordination and pro -\ncessing. Then, it is an interconnection to meet the requirements of information exchange \nbetween people and objects in various regions or large areas [5, 6]. The application of \nInternet of Things technology in smart grid can realize the perception and exchange of \nadvanced level, convenient operation and unified standard communication information, \nand complete the distributed intelligent information transmission, measurement and \ncontrol. Using smart sensors to connect a variety of equipment and facilities as a whole, \nand then constitute an integrated information service system, not only can process and \nanalyze a variety of information, but also can save costs through this way, and optimize \nthe operation and control of power grid.\n2. The role of IOT technology in power maintenance\nThe periodic maintenance mode formulated in 1950s is used for the maintenance of \npower equipment in China. So far, the main maintenance mode is still the method [7, 8]. \nThere are two inevitable deficiencies in this method. One is the large-scale maintenance \nof normal equipment, the other is the equipment damage caused by accidents, which \nforces the regular maintenance to inevitably lead to a large amount of human and mate -\nrial resources consumption.\nThe primary problem to be solved by Internet of Things technology is information \nacquisition. How to process information and how to realize overhaul decision should \nbe scientifically planned [9, 10]. As an independent management subject, maintenance \nmanagement is inseparable from the advanced technology management system. A vari -\nety of maintenance systems are composed of various management objectives in many \ncountries around the world. Under the condition of market factors and technical level, \na maintenance management mechanism including conditional maintenance and flexible \napplication of various methods is proposed. The addition of diagnosis expert system can \nmake the reliability and safety of the system meet the level of people’s needs, and opti -\nmize the maintenance plan and maintenance process.\nPage 4 of 24Wang et al. J Wireless Com Network         (2021) 2021:21 \n3  Power transformer\n1. Brief introduction\nPower transformer is one of the key equipment of power system, and its reliable \noperation characteristic is the guarantee of the whole power mechanism to supply \npower safely. The fault of power transformer will directly interfere with the normal \noperation of the power system, and also cause serious harm to the economy of power \ncompanies and power users [11]. At present, the power system is developing rapidly \nin the direction of ultra-high voltage, large power grid and automation, and the influ -\nence and interference of transformer fault on the normal operation of power system \nis becoming more and more serious [12]. Because the improvement process of power \ntransformer fault is related to the operating environment, load capacity and insula -\ntion level, it is difficult to find out some hidden faults immediately by using preventive \nmaintenance means. Preventive maintenance not only needs high cost, but also does \nnot have advanced level for development faults such as insulation. Therefore, it is very \nuseful to detect the transformer running fault system on-line at any time. The combi -\nnation of on-line detection technology and intelligent diagnosis of transformer fault \ncan timely discover the hidden dangers in the development, reduce the probability of \naccidents, and do a good job of prevention.\n2. Application of power transformer\nIn the contemporary society, electricity is a particularly important energy, it has pen -\netrated into every corner of human society. However, the power generated by power \nplants usually needs to be transported over long distances to reach the power area \n[13, 14]. When the transmission power is fixed, because the voltage and current are in \npositive proportion, the current required for transmission decreases with the increase \nin voltage. Because the impedance of the transmission path is almost a fixed value, \nand the line loss is proportional to the square of the current, increasing the transmis -\nsion voltage can greatly reduce the line voltage drop and line loss. At present, there \nare great difficulties in the manufacture of high-voltage generators. Therefore, spe -\ncial equipment must be used to boost the voltage before the voltage at the end of the \ngenerator is sent out. This special equipment is the transformer. In addition, at the \nreceiving end, it is necessary to use step-down transformer to reduce the high-voltage \nto the distribution system voltage, so many distribution transformers are used to reg -\nulate the high-voltage to the exact application value. In the power system, transform -\ners occupy a very important position, not only need a large number, but also have \nhigh efficiency and stable operation.\nWhen the transformer is in operation, the transformer will fail due to various fac -\ntors [15, 16]. If the transformer fails, it will affect the output of the generator, reduce \nand interrupt the power supply of some users, and prolong the maintenance time of \nthe transformer. If the accident cannot be detected and solved immediately, it will \ncause serious harm to the conventional power supply and residents’ property.\nPage 5 of 24\nWang et al. J Wireless Com Network         (2021) 2021:21 \n \n3.1  Power transformer fault diagnosis system based on Internet of Things\nThe decision-level fusion in the system uses extension theory to establish a fault diag -\nnosis model, uses correlation functions for evaluation, and comprehensively diagno -\nses the fault type of the transformer [17, 18]. The specific implementation process of \ndecision-level data fusion based on extension theory is as follows:\n1. Structure matter element matrix\nAccording to the concept of matter element and the ratio coding of each transformer \nand the fault type, the transformer fault type is divided into 9 levels, namely: U  = {u1, \nu2, u4, u5, u6, u7, u8, u9} = {I1, I2, I4, I5, I6, I7, I8, I9}, and according to the three \nratio codes of  C2H2/C2H4,  CH4/H2,  C2H4/C2H6 and the corresponding failure interval, \nthe three-dimensional matter element matrix constructed is:\nThe classic domain-free matrix for determining the fault type is:\nThe analysis result of the detected dissolved gas in the transformer oil is repre -\nsented by the matter element Z0, and the following three-dimensional matrix of the \nmatter to be diagnosed is obtained:\n2.

GPRS communication module\nThe online monitoring and diagnosis system will use the GR47 module in the embedded \nTCP/IP protocol stack. The GR47 module mainly includes GPRS communication mod -\nule and IP module, which are used to complete the TCP/IP protocol replacement, com -\nplete the receiving and sending of various information in turn, and provide data supply \nfor GPRS [19, 20]. In order to achieve various types of operating states, this module has \nalso designed various types of interfaces to meet work requirements. The adoption of \nthis module provides a lot of convenience for many users. It is mainly reflected in the \nfact that the protocol replacement process between TCP and IP does not need to send \npeople to manually operate, which reduces a variety of complicated control time, and \nmakes data transmission more clear and active. The transmitted data can reach the ter -\nminal of the other party’s network system directly after GR47 processing, which greatly \nreduces the development time of the system.\n2. Fault diagnosis module\nAfter receiving the exact data information, the fault diagnosis module is fused and ana -\nlyzed, and compared with the sample parameters in the diagnosis database to determine \nwhether the transformer is intact and its failure mechanism [21, 22]. If the fault is a gen-\neral type of low function, the diagnostic system will give a warning, allowing the user to \ncomplete the simple equipment adjustment according to the given operation steps [23]. \nWhen the fault is more serious and the performance is worse, the diagnostic system will \ncompare the collected data with the corresponding parameters of the transformer, ana -\nlyze the self-check data and important information in the technical reference library in \nall aspects, and determine the modules that can be replaced after the fault occurs. After \nmeeting the previous requirements, the system will give the user the specified repair \nsteps. In this stage, the system technical guidance from the determination of the trans -\nformer fault type to the fault resolution method is completed.\n3. Transformer fault diagnosis based on information fusion technology\nDue to the complexity of the transformer manufacturing process and the instability of \nthe operating state, the variety of transformer fault causes is caused, which is mainly \nreflected in the same type of fault mode with different fault characteristics, and the \nsame type of fault characteristic is the combined result of multiple failure modes [24, \n25]. Therefore, there are various nonlinear correspondences between failure modes and \nfailure characteristics. Therefore, in the transformer fault diagnosis, determining its \n(17)gi = 1 − h j(0 ≤ h j ≤ 1)\n(18)βj= (XT W jX)−1XT W jY\nPage 8 of 24Wang et al. J Wireless Com Network         (2021) 2021:21 \nrelationship is extremely critical. Information fusion technology is to analyze and pro -\ncess information and data from various information sources, to maximize the use of all \nfault characteristics of the transformer, to obtain multiple aspects of the same object of \nthe transformer from multiple angles, and to integrate them to achieve better accurate \nand more scientific online diagnosis. After the initial data evaluation and simple fault \ndiagnosis and analysis, the final result needs to be displayed concisely and clearly on the \nLCD screen of the monitoring site to facilitate the direct collection of information and \nmanagement planning.\n4  Experiment and analysis\n4.1  Materials and experimental design\n1. Data collection and determination of training samples\n Select 30 groups of transformer fault samples, and randomly select 10 groups for net-\nwork training. The remaining samples are used for testing. According to the designed \ntransformer diagnosis system model, each group of power transformers will be diag -\nnosed for four consecutive months, and the monitoring data will be recorded and \nanalyzed.\n2. Information analysis and processing (flowchart)\n The GPRS communication network mode is used to complete the communication \nbetween the data acquisition terminal and the monitoring terminal. The data acquisi-\ntion terminal transmits the data of the detected transformer parameters to the moni-\ntoring terminal or receives the monitoring information of the monitoring terminal. \nThe flowchart of the inspection plan is shown in Fig. 1.\n3. Detection and fault diagnosis module\n Measure the dissolved gas in the transformer oil and cooperate with the monitoring \nmanagement system, compare with the standard parameters in the diagnostic knowl-\nedge base, determine the performance status and fault type of the voltage trans -\nformer, give the user the operation steps for maintenance, and finally complete the \nfault type analysis of the transformer, and provide data support to technicians.\n4.

Therefore, the \ndiagnosis method using the Internet of Things technology comprehensively uses the \nentropy method to assign weights to each single diagnosis module, which reduces the \nerror interference, and the diagnosis accuracy is much higher than that of the single \ndiagnosis method, which can reflect the amount of uncertainty information of ran -\ndom variables. Use the acquired data information to eliminate the influence of sub -\njective factors and reflect the state of the system more objectively. The system state \ninformation is shown in Table 2 .\nAs shown in Fig.  3, because the transformer input and output power supply is 5 V, \nits core and on-chip peripherals power supply is 3.3 V, so the system uses two sets of \nregulated power supplies. The 220 V AC power is first stepped down by a step-down \ntransformer, the step-down AC power is rectified to DC by the rectifier bridge, fil -\ntered by C1, and then entered into the LM7805 voltage regulator module, and finally \noutput 5 V DC after R1 is divided. As shown in Table  3, the IoT system diagnoses that \nif the 5 V DC power is used in the sample and the high voltage output is 5.5 V, the \ndevice has characteristics such as low output current, low output voltage accuracy, \nand lack of stability.\nTable 2 Make full use of the acquired data and information results\nRectifier C1 LM7805 R1-pressure D-current I-Things Regulator\nInput 1.96 2.17 2.45 2.08 2.08 2.35 2.45\nOutput 2.77 2.48 2.75 2.89 2.88 2.34 2.83\nKernel 3.33 1.3 3.5 3.1 3.25 3.08 3.06\nRegulated 4.42 4.28 4.16 4.34 3.93 4.07 4.47\nAlternating 5.21 5.36 5.01 5.39 4.94 5.38 4.8\nStep-down 4.84 5.34 5.45 5.45 4.94 5.24 2.3\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\nInputO utputK ernelR egulated AlternatingS tep-down\nTransformer stability index\nTransformer interface type\nThe relarelationship between step-down module and step-down stability\nregulator I-Things D-current R1-pressure LM7805 C1 Rectifier\nFig. 3 The relationship between step-down module and step-down stability\nPage 12 of 24Wang et al.

Research on the effect of model processing after diagnosis\nTo compare and analyze the treatment effect of the fault diagnosis system model on \nthe transformer system diagnosis, the chromatogram data after the diagnosis of 10 \nsets of transformers are calculated as shown in Table 8 .\nAs shown in Fig.  8, when monitoring the connection current and total ground cur -\nrent of the iron core and clamps in the running state, there is no significant difference \nbetween the values and similar transformers, indicating that the discharge defect has \nbeen eliminated. The key to transformer fault diagnosis is the determination of fault \ndiagnosis standards. At present, chromatographic analysis of dissolved gases in trans -\nformer oil is often used to diagnose latent faults inside transformers.\nTable 8 Calculate the chromatographic data of 10 sets of transformers\nNum C2H2 C2H4 CH4 Core clip Connect current Total \nground \ncurrent\n1 4.3 2.4 2 7.07 7.2 7.03\n2 2.5 4.4 2 2.28 2.17 2.25\n3 3.5 1.8 3 2.54 2.75 2.31\n4 4.5 2.8 5 2.27 2.14 2.42\n5 4.2 4.26 4.35 4.19 4.16 4.2\nFig. 8 Chromatographic data of transformer after diagnosis\nPage 16 of 24Wang et al.

Trans -\nformers work on the principle of electromagnetic induction. Therefore, its structure \nis: two (or more than two) mutually insulated windings are sheathed on a common \niron core, and they are connected to each other through the coupling of the magnetic \ncircuit.\nAs shown in Fig.  10, the paper uses specific fault diagnosis samples for analysis, and \nthe diagnosis accuracy of combining multiple diagnosis methods is better than that \nof single diagnosis method, which verifies the effectiveness of this method.

The \ntest set data is shown in Table 9 .\nAs shown in Fig.  12, based on the addition of information fusion technology to the \nInternet of Things, the fault diagnosis system constructed in this article can quickly \nobtain sample data within 5 Min, which can better cooperate with the terminal data \ncollection link and improve actual efficiency.\nAs shown in Table  10, the experiment in this article takes the online diagnosis of \ntransformer faults as an example. If a traditional IoT measurement system is used, it \nwill take more than 20 min to get the final fault parameters. In this way, the required \nmeasurement time will be very long. It is long and very wasteful of time and cost. \nTherefore, the combination of extension theory proposed in this paper is used to train \nthe data samples in the Internet of Things to obtain a network model that meets the \nconvergence conditions and apply it to the data processing server. Through the infor -\nmation fusion technology, the information and data from various information sources \nare analyzed and processed, and all the fault characteristic quantities of the trans -\nformer are used to the greatest extent, and the multi-faceted information of the same \nobject of the transformer is obtained from multiple angles, and the integrated use can \nachieve more accurate and more scientific online diagnosis. After the initial data eval -\nuation and simple fault diagnosis and analysis, the final result needs to be displayed \nconcisely and clearly on the LCD screen of the monitoring site to facilitate the direct \ncollection of information and management planning. The Internet of Things can rea -\nsonably solve the terminal and communication problems in the distribution network. \nOnly by connecting the equipment and accessories in the distribution network to the \nInternet, the communication work of the distribution network can be completed, \nand the remote signaling, remote measurement, and automation technology such as \nremote control. It can be seen that the Internet of Things can deal with the problem of \nmany and frequently changing power distribution terminals.\n5. Training sample statistics\nThis paper studies collecting data from one day to many days in the field, selecting one \ntransformer data every hour in the training model, removing invalid measurement point \ndata, selecting 2/3 of them as training samples, and the remaining 1/3 as verification \nsamples.

The transformer fault diagnosis method based on \nthe Internet of Things has good pattern recognition capabilities, which can quickly, \neffectively and accurately diagnose transformer faults, and improve the fault diagno -\nsis capabilities of the entire system through the self-learning function of the network.\nAs shown in Fig.  13, the network structure and network parameters selected in this \npaper are reasonable, and the training error is less than 0.0001, which can accurately \nidentify the failure types of samples in the non-training set.

Exploration of diagnosis results\nQuoting the transformer fault diagnosis system model and inputting the fault \nparameters, the diagnosis results obtained are shown in Table 13.\nIt can be seen from Table  13 that when most power transformers fail, they are prone \nto high temperature and overheating. From the diagnosis results, it can be seen that the \nfault type of the transformer is mostly high-energy discharge, which is consistent with \nthe actual fault type. The transformer is the most critical component in the power sys -\ntem. For low-energy discharge and overheating, it is decomposed into a combination of \nlow-energy discharge and medium-temperature overheating. The main consideration \nis that the probability of low-energy discharge and medium-temperature overheating \nsimultaneously exists.\nTable 13 Diagnosis results\nSerial \nnumber\nFuzzy closeness Cause of actual \nsample failure\nSerial number Fuzzy closeness Cause of actual \nsample failure\n1 0.976 Discharge and over-\nheating\n6 0.932 High temperature \noverheating\n2 0.965 High energy exo-\nthermic\n7 0.923 Low temperature \noverheating\n3 0.960 Temperature over-\nheating\n8 0.865 Spark discharge\n4 0.961 High energy heat \nrelease\n9 0.864 Low energy discharge \nand heat release\n5 0.954 High energy dis-\ncharge\n10 0.831 Medium temperature \noverheating\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nHigh-chargeo verheatC ombination D-module T-over\nPerformance failure score\nPower filter type\nHigh-energy discharge and high-temperature overheading\ndiagnostic result Calculate weight Accuracy\nOverheating failureD ischarge failure\nFig. 14 High-energy discharge and high-temperature overheating\nPage 21 of 24\nWang et al.

The implementation process of the data module involved in the diagnosis in \nthis system is: decompose each diagnosis result, calculate the weighted (accuracy) scores \nof overheating faults and discharge faults, score according to the principle of rounding, \nand then judge according to the size of the score at the level, the fault type is finally \nobtained, and the score is shown in Table 14.\nTable 14 Fault type score data table\nItem Diagnostic result Calculate \nweight\nAccuracy Overheating \nfailure\nDischarge \nfailure\nHigh-charge 4.3 2.4 2 3.06 3.13\nOverheat 2.5 4.4 2 4.2 4.26\nCombination 3.5 1.8 3 2.3 4.95\nD-module 3.13 2.8 5 5.12 5.01\nT-over 4.37 4.2 4.26 5.32 4.19\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nD-failed N-faultC -diagnosis overheat DischargeM odule\nCoping behavior\nDiagnostic module\nThe diagnostic module fails to exit the comprehensive diagnosis\nCoefficientT roubleshooting SearchR obustnessC onvergence\nFig. 15 The diagnostic module fails to exit the comprehensive diagnosis\nTable 15 False judgment rate of fault type\nCoefficient Search Troubleshooting Robustness Convergence\nD-failed 4.3 2.4 2 2.28 2.17\nN-fault 2.5 4.4 2 2.54 2.75\nC-diagnosis 3.5 1.8 3 2.27 2.14\nOverheat 4.5 2.8 5 2.46 2.6\nDischarge 2.66 2.57 2.36 2.42 1.82\nModule 2.31 2.47 2.59 2.25 2.04\nPage 22 of 24Wang et al. J Wireless Com Network         (2021) 2021:21 \nAs shown in Fig.  15, if a diagnosis module fails to diagnose (no diagnosis result) or \ndiagnoses no fault, the diagnosis module will automatically exit the comprehensive diag-\nnosis. In this way, it is easy for two modules to think that there is discharge (or overheat-\ning), and only one module thinks that there is both overheating (and discharge), and the \ndiagnosis result will be a discharge and overheating fault. This is mainly considered from \nthe aspect of causing users to pay enough attention.\nAs shown in Table  15, using the combined diagnosis model to diagnose transformer \nfaults, the misjudgment rate of each fault type is much lower than that of using a sin -\ngle diagnostic module. It can be seen that the use of the Internet of Things and a series \nof methods to diagnose power transformer faults is better than traditional diagnostic \nmethods, and can effectively improve the accuracy of fault diagnosis.\n5  Conclusion\nThis paper mainly expounds the combination of Internet of Things and smart grid \ntechnology and the role of Internet of Things technology in power maintenance, ana -\nlyzes the use of power transformer and its fault diagnosis system, and focuses on \nGPRS communication module and fault diagnosis module in data acquisition termi -\nnal, and deeply explores transformer fault diagnosis and data management subsystem \nbased on information fusion technology. It can be seen that GPRS communication \nnetwork combined with Internet of Things technology can effectively diagnose the \nfault system of power transformer.\nThe research results of this paper: 30 groups of transformer fault samples are \nselected, and 10 groups are randomly selected for network training, and the remain -\ning samples are used for testing. The transformer fault system diagnosis model is \nestablished for each group of power transformers for four consecutive months. This \npaper studies the detection success rate of power transformer fault diagnosis system \nmodel based on the Internet of Things. The training error is less than 0.0001, and it \ncan accurately identify the fault types of non training samples.\nAlthough many scholars have made outstanding achievements in the research of \npower transformer fault diagnosis system and Internet of Things technology, but at \nthe same time, in view of some limitations of this study, we hope that the Internet of \nThings and transformer fault diagnosis technology should also consider other prob -\nlems that are easy to be ignored while meeting the demand, so as to better improve \nthe fault diagnosis technology and more widely use it. If the fault system diagnosis \ntechnology can be further improved and applied to power transformer better, it will \ngreatly improve the safety of people’s life.\nAbbreviations\nPLC: Programmable Logic Controller; SNR: Signal Noise Ratio; IOT: Indexed Organized Table; TCP: Transmission Control \nProtocol; IP: Internet Protocol; LCD: Liquid crystal display; DC: Direct current; GPRS: General Packet Radio Service.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors thank the editor and anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments and valuable suggestions.\nAuthor’s contributions\nAll authors take part in the discussion of the work described in this paper.
