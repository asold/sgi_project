Introduction\nDrug discovery is а lengthy рrосess of finding out a new drug molecule by complex synthetic and analytical procedures. \nThe process takes many years to complete and is difficult if we follow the conventional methods. These difficulties have \nbeen overcome by introducing computer programmes in drug discovery. The main advantage of Computer-Aided Drug \nDesign (CADD) is the reduction of the time and human resources needed for the рrосess of drug discovery. CADD helps \nus design а molecule by modifying а pre-existing drug molecule or by newly inventing а molecule to predict its possible \nbiological activities. It includes target identification, hit identification, and molecular modification of а lead compound \nto optimize desired effects and minimize side effects, based on the knowledge of their biological targets.   \nCADD can increase the hit rate of novel drug compounds in the drug design as it uses а more targeted search than \ntraditional High Throughput Screening (HTS) and combinatorial chemistry. It aims to explain a drug’s molecular basis \nand therapeutic activity and to predict possible derivatives that would improve the biological activity by minimizing the \nundesired effects. A lead compound is a molecule having a particular biological activity obtained either from a natural \nor synthetic source [1]. \nStructure-based computer-aided drug design relies upon the ability to determine and analyze three dimensional (3D) \nstructures of biological target molecules. The core hypothesis of this approach is that a molecule’s ability to interact \nwith a specific target protein and exert a desired biological effect depends on its ability to favorably interact with a \nparticular binding site on that target. Molecules that share those favorable interactions will also exert similar biologic \neffects [25]. \n\nWorld Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews, 2022, 14(02), 453–465 \n454 \nLigand-based drug design trusts t he awareness of new ligand molecules that bind with the target protein molecule. \nThese differently designed molecules are used to develop a new strategy that explains each element responsible for the \ninteraction between ligand and target molecule. Ligand-based drug design depends on small molecules that bind to the \nactive binding site of the biological target with their interest  [2]. These molecules are used to extract a suitable model \nthat provides the important structural properties of a lead molecule, which helps in the binding process with the target \nmolecule. It is otherwise called indirect drug design. \nMolecular modelling is the process of designing a molecule with a computer -based collection of programmes (in -silico \ndesign) for deriving, representing, and manipulating the structures and reactions of molecules. The properties of these \nmolecules are dependent on their three -dimensional structures. Several computer -based programmes suitable for in -\nsilico drug design have been developed during these years in which the most reliable ones have been reviewed here in \nthis article [13]. \nIdeally the computational method should be able to predict affinity before a compound is synthesized and hence in \ntheory only one compound needs to be synthesized. The reality however is that present computational methods are \nimperfect and provide at best only qualitatively accurate estimates of affinity. Therefore, in practice, it still takes several \niterations of design, synthesis, and testing before an optimal molecule is discovered. On the other hand, computational \nmethods have accelerated discovery by reducing the number of iterations required and in addition have often provided \nmore novel small molecule structures [3,8]. \n1.1. Docking \nDocking means a computational simulation of a candidate ligand binding to a receptor. In molecular modelling, docking \nis used to predict how a target protein will interact with a small molecule. The flexibility of molecules plays a crucial \nrole in docking analysis. \n1.2. Rigid Docking and Flexible Docking \nRigid docking means there is no modification in the bond angles, bond lengths an d torsion angles of the components at \nany stage of complex generation, whereas in flexible docking, we can modify all these, which permits conformational \nchange and results in the best-docked pose.[12]. \n2. Material and methods \n2.1. Molecular Editors and Visualization Tооls \nMolecular editors are the commonly used tools to draw and manipulate chemical structures. These tools also provide \nseveral facilities such as geometry optimisation, structure visualisation, energy minimisation and three -dimensional \nimage creations. \nMany tools are used in computer -aided drug design for different purposes like creating 3D structures of chemical \nentities, creating SMILES notations, 3D molecular visualisation tools, prediction of pharmacological activities, toxicity \npredictions, and docking studies. These tools help design a new chemical entity to produce a desired pharmacological \neffect [4,19]. Here we discuss some newly introduced software that can be used as the best tools for in-silico drug design \nstudies. \n2.2. Graphical User Interface \nSeveral computer programmes can be utilised as drug design and development tools, providing all the basic \nfunctionalities related to the drug design. Some important ones are reviewed below.  \n2.3.

Ligаnd Sсоut \nLigand Scout is software used for creating three -dimensional (3D) pharmacophore models from structural data of \nmacromolecule–ligand complexes. It incorporates the 3D chemical features such as hydrogen bond donors, acce ptors, \nlipophilic areas, positively and negatively ionisable chemical groups that describe the interaction of a bound small \norganic molecule (ligand) and the surrounding binding site of the macromolecule. These pharmacophores can be \noverlaid and superimpos ed using a pattern -matching based alignment algorithm based solely on pharmacophoric \nfeature points instead of chemical structure. The software has successfully predicted new lead structures in drug design \n[40,87]. \n2.4.11. СhemBiоDrаw \nChemDraw, available from CambridgeSoft, has long been the preferred package for drawing chemical structures for \npublication-quality graphics. It also has been used as the drawing package for database queries and electronic \nnotebooks. The package has developed enhancements such as NMR spectra prediction, TLC plate tools, molecular and \nphysicochemical property calculations, and structure naming. With the latest version (Version 11), perhaps the first \nsurprise is the name change to reflect the increased emphasis on the biological draw ing features of BioDraw [30,31]. \n2.4.12. СhemАxоn \nIt provides several desktop tools such as the drawing tool Marvin and plugins to calculate various physicochemical \nproperties. A tool to calculate pKa and the resulting LogD, the essential physicochemical property in medicinal \nchemistry.

Molinspiration tools are written \nin Java and can be used on any computer platform [50,63]. \n2.4.16. Ассоrd for Excel \nAccord for Excel is a valuable tool used by all the synthetic chemists at Biovitrum. We first acquired Accord with the \ncombinatorial chemistry add-in to provide an easy -to-use method for chemists (both medicinal and combinatorial) to \nenumerate libraries and combine structural and analytical data, often exported from instruments in Excel format. It \nprovides us with a convenient method of moving chemical structures and data between systems and performing simple \ncalculations on those structures [47,54]. \n2.4.17. Docking tools \nSome docking applications will generate a 3D structure and multiple conformations of the proposed ligand, and many \nalso include a variety of scoring functions to rank the proposed poses.  \n2.4.18. SeeSAR \nIt is a virtual drug design platform. Quick and informative calculations can be used to dock, design, and analyse a new \nchemical entity in a flash. It evaluates ligand -target interactions by intuitive colour codes and gorgeous visualisation. \nDrag and Drop facilities for both ligands and targets are available. If we choose the structure -based drug design, there \nmay be facilities to edit the target protein virtually. The most exciting part of th e platform is its Inspirator mode which \ngives new ideas to discover new scaffolds, explore and grow into free cavities, or link molecules using fragment libraries \nfor elegant solutions [59,60,82]. \n2.4.19. AutoDock \nAutodock is a suite of automated docking tools. It is designed to predict how small molecules, such as substrates or drug \ncandidates bind to a known 3D structure receptor. It has been modified and improved to add new functionalities, and \nmultiple engines have been developed. Now two major generations are there: AutoDock 4 and AutoDock Vina. \nAutoDock-GPU is an accelerated version of AutoDock4 that is hundreds of times faster than the original single -CPU \ndocking code. It can also help to guide organic synthetic chemists to design better binders  [68,69]. \n2.4.20. Autodock Vina \nAutodock is one of the docking engines of the AutoDock Suite, an open-source program for molecular docking. It is more \naccurate than Autodock. It is more compatible and easier to use.  \n2.4.21. Swiss dock \nIt is an online docking web service that provides s ervices to dock and predict molecular interactions between a \nbiological target molecule and a ligand drug molecule. It consists of a database, namely S3DB, which manually curates \ntarget and ligand structures inspired by the Ligand-Protein Database. It can generate a complex to perform subsequent \ncalculations. It works on its own server for docking, giving an accurate docked score compared to others. The time taken \nfor docking may vary. Large molecules cannot be used on this service  [70,79]. \n2.4.22. InfiniSee \nInfiniSee is a virtual screening platform. It finds molecules of interest in chemical spaces of (almost) infinite size based \non similarity. Given a template or query molecule, infiniSee returns similar molecules from these chemical spaces or \nscreening libraries [75]. \n2.4.23. Zdосk \nZdock performs a full rigid -body search of docking orientations between two proteins. The current version, 3.0.2, \nincludes performance optimisation and a novel pairwise statistical energy potential. M-ZDOCK: A modification of ZDOCK \nto predict symmetric assemblies using a subunit structure. ZRANK: A docking refinement program developed to provide \nfast and accurate rescoring of models from initial -stage docking (e.g., from ZDOCK), as well as refined docking models \n(e.g., from Rosetta Dock). ZDOCK Server: a protein docking server permitting users to run the latest versions of ZDOCK  \n[73,89]. \nWorld Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews, 2022, 14(02), 453–465 \n459 \n2.4.24. GОLD \nIt is the validated, configurable protein-ligand docking software for expert drug discovery from virtual screening to lead \noptimisation. The extensively validated scoring functions in GOLD can be trusted. It has the features of pose prediction, \nmultiple scoring functions, flexible docking, virtual screening, water  handling and covalent docking. \n2.4.25. Glide \nGlide offers the full range of speed vs accuracy options, from high -throughput virtual screening mode for efficiently \nenriching million compound libraries to the standard precision mode for reliably docking tens to hundreds of thousands \nof ligands with high accuracy, to the XP (extra precision) mode where further elimination of false positives is \naccomplished by more extensive sampling and advanced scoring, resulting in even higher enrichment  [86,62]. \n2.4.26. FlexAID  \nIt is a molecular docking software that can use small molecules and peptides as ligands and proteins and nucleic acids \nas docking targets. As the name suggests, FlexAID supports complete ligand flexibility and side -chain flexibility of the \ntarget. It does use a soft scoring function based on the complementarity of the two surfaces  [58,76]. \n2.4.27. GEMDOCK \nThe generic evolutionary method of docking is named GEMDOCK. It is a program for computing a ligand conformation \nand orientation relative to the target protein’s active si te. It may run as either a purely flexible or hybrid docking \napproach. It automatically generates all docking variables, such as atom formal charge, atom type, and the ligand -\nbinding site of a protein. It is now accompanied by many add-on programmes, making it truly convenient and less time-\nconsuming [71,72]. \n2.4.28. MS-Dосk \nMS-DOCK is an efficient multiple conformation rigid -body docking approach based on DOCK. It can be easily used for \nthe generation of multi-conformer libraries and for shape-based filtering within a multi-step structure-based screening \nprotocol to shorten computation time [42,53]. \n2.4.29. Ligand Fit \nLigand Fit is a shape -based method for accurately docking the ligands into a protein’s active binding site. The method \nemploys a cavity detection algorithm f or detecting invaginations in the protein as candidate active site regions. \nCandidate poses are minimised in the context of the active site using a grid-based method for evaluating protein-ligand \ninteraction energies [35,36]. \n2.4.30. UСSF Dосk \nUCSF dock is another docking software in which DOCK6 is the latest version written in C++ and is functionally separated \ninto independent components allowing a high degree of flexibility. It needs about 100 MB of disk space. The new features \nadded include additional scoring options for energy minimisation, Delphi electrostatics, ligand conformational entropy \ncorrections, ligand desolvation, receptor desolvation, receptor flexibility, conjugate grading minimization [55,56]. \n2.4.31. GalaxyPepDock \nGalaxyPepDock is a web server-based protein-protein docking interface. It performs similarity-based docking by finding \ntemplates from the database of experimentally determined structures and building models using energy -based \noptimisation that allows for structural flexibility [52, 41]. \n2.4.32. Stаrdrор \nIt is one of the best in -silico technological tools used in Cheminformatics, model building and analysis of chemical \nentities in drug design and development. It brings about the latest data of drug molecules and targets, which is extremely \nhelpful in predicting biological activity and molecular modelling. It is the best tool to rely on for decision -making while \nresearching drug design. Both the free version and commercial versions are available for this  [66,49]. \n2.4.33. rDock \nrDock is a fast and versatile open-source program for docking ligands to proteins and nucleic acids, primarily designed \nfor high-throughput virtual screening and prediction of binding mode  [38, 67]. \nWorld Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews, 2022, 14(02), 453–465 \n460 \n2.5. Biological Activity Prediction Tools \n2.5.1. Wаy2Drug \nWay2Drug portal has been developed and supported b y the multidisciplinary team of researchers working in \nbioinformatics, cheminformatics, and computer -aided drug discovery for about thirty years. It provides a local \ncorrespondence concept, according to which biological activity of drugs -like organic compo unds are based on the \nmolecular recognition between the particular atoms of the ligand and the target. Using this concept, we have developed \na consistent system of atom-centred neighbourhoods of atoms descriptors, including MNA (Filimonov et al., 1999), QNA \n(Filimonov et al., 2009), and LMNA (Rudik et al., 2014), and have implemented them in several SAR/QSAR/QSPR \nmodelling approaches [45,46]. \n2.5.2. РАSS \nThe concept of the biological activity spectrum was introduced to describe the properties of biologically active \nsubstances. The PASS (prediction of activity spectra for substances) software product, which predicts more than three \nhundred pharmacological effects and biochemical mechanisms based on the structural formula of a substance, maybe \nefficiently be used to find new targets (mechanisms) for some ligands and, conversely, to reveal new ligands for some \nbiological targets. We have developed a WWW interface for the PASS software. A WWW server for the online prediction \nof the biological activity spectra of substances has been constructed [48,85]. \n2.5.3. GUSAR \nGUSAR software was developed to create QSAR/QSPR models based on the appropriate training sets represented as SD \nfiles containing data about chemical structures and endpoint in quantitative terms. GUSAR has been  developed \naccording to OECD (Organisation for Economic. Co -operation and Development) principles and includes the last \nachievements in QSAR modelling: consensus prediction, applicability domain assessment, internal and external models’ \nvalidation, and precise interpretations of obtaining results [61,84]. \n2.5.4. BRENDA  \nIt is the most comprehensive information repository on enzymes and enzyme ligand data. The BRENDA enzyme \ninformation system has developed into an elaborate system of enzyme and enzyme -ligand information obtained from \nvarious sources, combined with flexible query systems and evaluation tools  [51,90]. \n2.5.5. Pharma Expert Software \nPharmaExpert determines the existing relationships between pharmacological effects and biochemical mechanisms. \nThe current version of PharmaExpert covers 1587 mechanisms of action, 418 pharmaco-therapeutical effects and 2664 \ntypes of relationships between them. Each biologically active compound reveals various biological actions in biological \nsystems (human organisms, animals, in vi vo and in vitro assays). It is impossible to study each compound in all tests \ncurrently available. Therefore, the ability to select compounds with required types of biological activity and without \nunwanted adverse effects and toxicity is very desirable [77,78]. \n2.5.6. Chemical Checker \nIt is a resource of chemical and biological small molecule similarities. Molecules are compared from multiple viewpoints \nrelevant to the drug discovery pipeline, from the chemical properties to the clinical outcomes  [37, 65]. \n2.5.7. Toxtree \nToxtree is a fully featured and flexible, user -friendly open-source application that can estimate toxic hazards using a \ndecision tree approach. Toxtree could be applied to datasets from various compatible file types. User-defined molecular \nstructures are also supported – they could be entered by SMILES or the built-in 2D structure diagram editor [74,92]. \n2.6. Open-Source Cheminformatics toolkits \nOpen-Source Cheminformatics toolkits are software development kits that allow the development of unique computer \napplications for virtual screening and bioinformatics. The toolkits include ADMET predictor, MedChem studio, \nMedChem designer and OpenBabel [88]. \nStrategy to follow is to use keywords from your title in first few sentences  \nWorld Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews, 2022, 14(02), 453–465 \n461 \n3. Results and discussion \nThis from the data reviewed from various authentified journal publications, we found that several bioinformatics tools \nare being used for drug design through docking studies. All these software is based on computer simulations and large \ndatabases. By reviewing one by one, it has been noticed that some of them are incredibly useful and precise compared \nto others. The consolidated report on these is given as follows: \nTable 1 Consolidated report of features of docking software \nSoftware Release \nYear \nOpen \nAccess \nOperating \nSystem \nDocking \nscore \naccuracy \nLigand \nedited \nAuto \nbinding site \ndetection \nADMET \nproperties \n3D \nvisualisation Rating \nSeeSAR 2019 No Windows 8 Yes Yes Yes Yes 7 \nAutodock 1990 Yes Windows 9 Yes Yes Yes Yes 9 \nAutodock Vina \nExtended 2018 Yes Windows 9 Yes Yes Yes Yes 9 \nSwiss Dock 2011 Yes Windows 7 No No Yes Yes 8 \nInfiniSee 2019 No Windows 8 Yes Yes Yes Yes 8 \nZdock 2010 Yes Windows 6 No No Yes Yes 6 \nGOLD 1995 No Windows 6 No No Yes Yes 6 \nGlide 2004 No Windows 7 Yes No Yes Yes 6 \nFlexAID 2015 Yes Windows 6 No No Yes Yes 5 \nGEMDOCK 2004 Yes Windows 7 Yes No Yes Yes 7 \nSeeSAR 2019 No Windows 8 Yes Yes Yes Yes 7 \nMS-Dock 2008 No Windows 5 No No Yes Yes 5 \nLigandFit 2003 No Windows 6 Yes No Yes Yes 6 \nUCSF Dock 1982 Yes Windows 8 Yes Yes Yes Yes 8 \nGalaxyPepDock 2018 No Windows 5 Yes No Yes Yes 5 \nStardrop 2016 No Windows 7 Yes Yes Yes Yes 7 \nrDock 1998 Yes Windows 5 No No Yes Yes 6 \nWay2Drug 2016 Yes Windows 7 No No Yes Yes 9 \nBlaster 2009 Yes Windows 7 No No Yes Yes 5 \nHaddock 2003 Yes Windows 6 No No Yes Yes 5 \n4. Conclusion \nThe present review has shown that several bioinformatics tools are used for drug design through docking studies. For \ndocking, it has been noticed that a few reliable and high -profile software are available only as commercial versions. To \naccess these, we n eed to invest a considerable amount of money annually since they do not provide lifetime access to \nany of these paid versions. Apart from all these, only a precise docking result will give perfect biological activity \nprediction depending on the flexibility  of both the ligand and the target. This can be obtained by dealing with a broad \ndatabase and perfect computer simulations. Both these features are found only in a minimal amount of software. Since \nit is meant to be used commercially and costs high, it is not familiar among academicians, research scholars, and \nstudents. Therefore, many people are ignorant about the usefulness of these software.  \nAutodock still has the upper hand among all the bioinformatic tools because of its accuracy and free availability . Its \nlatest version available is Autodock Vina extended. Several Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) are available for Autodock \nWorld Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews, 2022, 14(02), 453–465 \n462 \nVina, making it functional and significantly less time -consuming for the docking process. This programme’s advantage \nis that it does not need any language commands now, as in their older versions. It also supports both Windows and Mac \noperating systems. The only disadvantage is needing a bit larger disk space to run the programme. Apart from Autodock, \nSeeSAR and infiniSee are also hi gh-profile software from BiosolveIT. Next comes UCSF Chimera and PASS because of \ntheir reliability of results. The use of activity prediction and other QSAR studies, the software used are strictly based on \nthe reliability of its results. \nCompliance with ethical standards \nDisclosure of conflict of interest \nNo conflict of interest. \nReferences \n[1] Banegas-Luna A-J, Ceron-Carrasco JP, Perez-Sanchez H.
