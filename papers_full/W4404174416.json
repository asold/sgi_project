    "abstract": "The advent of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Gemini has offered new learning and assessment opportunities to integrate artificial intelligence (AI) with education. This study evaluated the accuracy of LLMs in assessing an assignment from a course on sports physiology. Concordance and correlation between human graders and LLMs were mostly moderate to poor. The findings suggest AI’s potential to complement human expertise in educational assessment alongside the need for adaptive learning by educators.",
