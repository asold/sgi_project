Introduction \nTeaching and learning English in Saudi Arabia serves a limited purpose because the language is still considered a \nforeign language in the Kingdom (Aljafen, 2013) and is  not actively used in everyday activities. Despite the \nrecent reforms undertaken by the Saudi government in the teaching and learning of English as a foreign language, \nmost Saudi EFL learners do not possess even a modest level of proficiency in this language. One significant \nreason behind the low competence of Saudi learners in Eng lish could be the feelings of anxiety that are often \nprevalent in English language classes in Saudi Arabia. In English language classes in this context, most learners \noften appear reluctant to participate in classroom disc ourse, are unwilling to provide responses, seldom ask \nquestions, are unwilling to engage in class discussions, and are overly dependent on their teacher. In such a \ncollectivist country, the Saudi academic culture causes the teacher to do minate the learning process and learners \nto utilize typical learning strategies, such as recep tion, memorization, and reproduction, which appears to \nencourage them to be more passive observers. Given the highly negative impact that anxiety has always had on \nEFL learners’ behavior and educational outcomes in the Saudi context (Al-Sibai, 2005), it is a vital issue to \ninvestigate this phenomenon in a greater depth in order to identify the causes of such a phenomenon and to offer \nsome suggestions and potential solutions that could help both teachers and lear ners in Saudi Arabia to deal with \nthe feelings of anxiety in English as a foreign language classes. \n2. Review of Related Literature \n2.1 What Is Language Anxiety? \nThe concept of anxiety is a central construct in theori es of personality (Al-Shboul, Ahmad, Nordin, & Rahman, \n2013). In a broad sense, anxiety is a state characterized by the sensation of vague fear, nervousness, discomfort, \nand apprehension that is not linked to a specific cause or  situation. Anxiety has been a focus of research in \nforeign language education since the early 1970s (e.g ., Aida, 1994; Dörnyei, 2005; Horwitz, 1986; Horwitz, \nHorwitz, & Cope, 1986; Horwitz & Young, 1991; Scovel, 1978). Young (1992) conceptualized foreign language \nanxiety (FLA) as a complicated psychological phenome non specific to language learning. MacIntyre and \nGardner (1994) also defined FLA as the feeling of tension and apprehension specifically associated with second \nwww.ccsenet.org/elt English Language Teaching V ol. 7, No. 7; 2014 \n83 \n \nor foreign language contexts, including speaking, listening, and learning, or the worry and negative emotional \nreaction when learning or using a second or foreign language. \nPast research (e.g., Dörnyei, 2005; Ellis, 1994; Gardne r, 1985; Horwitz, 2001; Horwitz et al., 1986; MacIntyre, \n1998; Scovel, 1978) argued that anxiety in the context of  foreign or second language learning is different from \nand independent of personality trait anxiety and state an xiety. MacIntyre and Gardner (1989) stated that the \nanxiety that specifically affects English and French vocabulary acquisition and production is different from \nanxiety in general. Dörnyei (2005) further noted that language learning anxiety is not a transfer of anxiety from \nother domains such as test anxiety or communication apprehension but rather a uniquely L2-related variable.  \n2.2 Characteristics of Anxious Learners \nEmpirical research has identified ma ny features of anxious learners. Burden (2004) assumed that anxious \nstudents are often concerned about the impressions that others form of them. When these students are confronted \nin a classroom with a learni ng situation that makes them uncomfortable, they may choose to withdraw from the \nactivity. Burden added that some learners believe they cannot perform in English and thus form negative \nexpectations, which in turn lead to decreased effort and the avoidance of opportunities to enhance their \ncommunication skills. Additionally, anxious foreign language students are generally less willing to participate in \nlearning activities and perform worse than non-anxious students (Aida, 1994; MacIntyre & Gardner, 1991). \nMoreover, Price (1991) described anxious language learners as those having manifestations in class that include \npanic, indecision, anger, and a sense of diminished personality.  \n2.3 Sources of Language Anxiety \nThere are numerous anxiety-provoking situations in the language classroom. Horwitz et al. (1986) identified \nthree components of foreign language classroom anxiety. The first component is communication apprehension, \nwhich refers to “a type of shyness characterized by fear of or anxiety about communicating with people” \n(Horwitz et al., 1986, p. 127). The second component is fear of negative evaluation, which is broadly defined by \nHorwitz et al. (1986) as an apprehension about others’ evaluations, avoidance of evaluative situations, and the \nexpectation that others will evaluate one negatively. Test anxiety is the third component of FLA, and it refers to \n“an apprehension over academic evaluation” (MacIntyre & Gardner, 1989, p. 42). Young (1991) attributed \nforeign language classroom anxiety to six sources: personal and interpersonal anxieties, learner beliefs about \nlanguage learning, instructor beliefs about language learning, instructor-learner interactions, classroom \nprocedures, and language testing. Moreover, Horwitz (200 1) acknowledged that the lack of perceived teacher \nsupport is a major factor that can evoke a learner’s an xiety. Numerous studies (Oxford, 1999; Phillips, 1992; \nReid, 1995; Samimy, 1994; Young, 1999) noted likewise that speaking activities, negative classroom experiences, \nteachers’ harsh teaching styles, learne rs’ inability to comprehend, learners ’ learning styles, and the learning \ncontext are all sources of learners’ anxiety in language classes. \n2.4 Anxiety and Language Learning \nFLA has been found to adversely affect foreign languag e learning. Gardner, Trembl ay, and Masgoret (1997) \ninvestigated the relationship between FLA among different affective variables and language performance and \nconcluded that FLA had the highest negative correlation with language achievement. Previous studies also found \nthat FLA is negatively correlated with confidence and self-esteem, attitude, motivation, autonomy, and other \ntraits (Hilleson, 1996; Liu, 2012; MacIntyre & Gardner, 1991). MacIntyre and Gardner (1991) stated that anxiety \nregarding second/foreign language learning and performance affect at least five domains: academically (high \nlevels of FLA are associated with low levels of academ ic achievement in second/f oreign language learning), \nsocially (learners with higher language anxiety have the tendency to avoid interpersonal communication more \noften than less anxious learners), cognitively (anxiety can prevent certain info rmation from entering a learner’s \ncognitive processing system, influencing both the speed and accuracy of learning), personally (language learning \ncould become a painful experience that reduces one’s self-esteem or self-confidence as a learner), and in terms of \ncommunication output  (communication may be in terrupted by the “freezing- up” moments that students \nencounter when they feel anxious). More recently, Batumlu and Erden (2007) examined the relationship between \nlanguage achievement and anxiety and found that there was a negative correlation between learners’ achievement \nand their anxiety levels. \n2.5 Research on Language Anxiety in the Saudi EFL Context \nDespite the appearance of recent studies that attempted to  investigate various aspects of the concept, there is \nlimited research on FLA in the Saudi EFL setting. These studies are sufficiently scarce that further research can \nbe extremely beneficial. Abu-Ghararah  (1999) conducted a study to determine the effect of FLA on English \nwww.ccsenet.org/elt English Language Teaching V ol. 7, No. 7; 2014 \n84 \n \nachievement. Using the Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale (FLCAS) and the grades given to 240 \nsecondary and university students, a negative correlation was found between higher FLA and the students’ \nEnglish achievement. Using a multi-method approach including questionnaires, individual and group interviews, \nand classroom and informal ob servations, Al-Saraj (2013) gathered in formation on the FLA perspectives of ten \nfemale college students who were learning EFL in Saud i Arabia. Participants in this study attributed their \nlanguage anxiety to certain anxiety-pr ovoking entities, including the teacher, the teacher-learner interaction, the \nteaching method, fear of negative ev aluation, competitiveness, and the co mmunication style. Alrabai (2014a) \nconducted an experimental study to ex plore the effects of the teacher’s anxi ety-reducing strategies on learners’ \nFLA in the Saudi context. He used FLCAS scores before  and after a 10-week experimental treatment course to \nevaluate learners’ anxiety and classroom observations to assess the teacher’s anxiety-reducing practices; Alrabai \nestablished a positive causal relationship between teachers’ anxiety-reducing behaviors and learners’ FLA in that \nanxiety-reducing strategies by teachers resulted in low levels of language anxiety in learners. \nDespite the valuable insights that these studies provided in identifying certain sources of FLA among Saudi EFL \nlearners, the conclusions derived from such studies remain equivocal due to their limited scope in terms of \nnumber and nature of participants recruited. For this reas on, a large-scale investigation is still needed to explore \nthe sources and levels of language anxiety among a large population of Saudi EFL learners over different periods \nof time and to propose a context-based model of FLA for the Saudi EFL context based on the conclusions drawn \nfrom the findings of this investigation.The significance of the present study lies in that it promotes, through the \nFLA model it proposes, the awareness of the different partners in the EFL learning process in Saudi Arabia (e.g., \nthe teacher, the learner, and the academ ic institutions) of the causes/sources  of FLA in this country. This \nconsciousness could help substantially in finding ways to deal with these sources and therefore decrease learners’ \nanxiety, which would in turn improve learning outcomes.  \n3. Study Methodology \nThis study’s objective is to empirically identify the so urces and levels of FLA that Saudis typically experience \nwhen learning English and to propose a context-based model of FLA for Saudi EFL learners constructed based \non the comparisons derived from the three studies’ findings.  \n3.1 Participants \nThe participants were 1389 volunteer male and female EF L learners who were recruited in three data collection \niterations. Participating students were Saudi nationals an d spoke Arabic as their first language. Selection of \nparticipants (including their gender) was completely random, took place in both rural and urban areas of the \ncountry, and was designed to cover the different sectors of public education in Saudi Arabia as widely as possible. \nThe study recruited 915 English-major and 474 non-English-major EFL students from four geographic areas. \nAdditional information regarding the learners who participated in the three studies is presented in Table 1. \n \nTable 1.

FQ = frequency, % = percentage. \n \n3.2 Instrument \nThe study employed the FLCAS, which was developed by Horwitz et al. (1986) and has been widely used by \nresearchers worldwide (Horwitz et al., 1986; Huang, 2008; Lei, 2004; Young, 1991; Zhao, 2007) to investigate \nFLA. The FLCAS comprises 33 items, each of which utilizes a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 ( strongly \ndisagree) to 5 ( strongly agree) to assess respondents’ anxiety in language classrooms. The total scale scores \nranged from 33 to 165, with high scores indicating high FLA. Nine items (2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 18, 22, 28, and 32) \nwere negatively worded, and their scores were reversely computed. Horwitz et al. (1986) noted that the 33 items \nin the FLCAS related to the three main sources of FLA:  communication apprehension (items 1, 4, 9, 14, 15, 18, \n24, 27, 29, 30, and 32), test anxiety (items 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 16, 17, 20, 21, 22, 25, 26, and 28), and fear of \nnegative evaluation (items 2, 7, 13, 19, 23, 31, and 33). The FLCAS’s reliability was confirmed by Horwitz \n(1986), who reported a Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of .93 (N = 108) for the first test and a coefficient of .83 (N \n= 78) for the second test, which was launched eight week s later (p. 560). Other studies have also reported the \nreliability of the FLCAS (Aida, 1994; Cheng, Horwitz, & Schallert, 1999; Elkhafaifi, 2005; Saito, Horwitz, & \nGarza, 1999; Zhang, 2010).  \n3.3 Data Collection \nOver the three years from 2012 to 2014, the study data was collected via three data collection iterations. After \nthey were provided with ample information about the study’s nature and procedures, participants were asked to \nsign a consent form to confirm their approval to take  part in the study. For underage participants (i.e., \nintermediate and high school students), their guardian’s approval was also sought and obtained before they were \nincluded in the study. Only those participants who granted their consent were involved in the study. The \nparticipating learners received detailed instructions on  how to complete the FLCAS questionnaire and were \nguaranteed that their responses would remain confidentia l. To ensure response accuracy and honesty, the \nFLCAS’s questions were translated in to the subjects’ mother tongue of Ar abic, and the verified, translated \nversion was administered to learners privately by the re searcher. This version of the FLCAS can be found in the  \nAppendix. The learners required 30–45 minutes to respond to the entire questionnaire.  \n3.4 Data Analysis \nDescriptive statistics were generated to identify the le vels of FLA for the study’s Saudi EFL students. Item \nanalysis was conducted to determine the survey items a ssociated with the highest m ean scores, which would be \nindicative of the major causes of FLA for Saudi learners . An explanatory factor an alysis (EFA) with varimax \nrotation was performed to reveal the underlying components and subcomponents of this measurement and thus \nidentify classroom sources of FLA for the study population of Saudi learners. A model of FLA for Saudi EFL \nlearners was proposed based on the EFA results. \n4. Results \n4.1 Levels of Anxiety \nWe used the anxiety-level scale developed by Krinis (2007) to identify the levels of FLA among the Saudi \nstudents recruited in this study. On this scale, learners ’ anxiety levels are categorized into five categories that \nrange from “very low” to “high” using the 20\nth, 40th, 60th, and 80th percentiles. Based on this scale, the subjects in \nwww.ccsenet.org/elt English Language Teaching V ol. 7, No. 7; 2014 \n86 \n \nthis current research were divided into the five anxiety levels depicted in Table 2. \n \nTable 2.

FQ = frequency, % = percentage. \n \nLearners in the three investigations demonstrated similar levels of anxiety. As seen in Table 2, learners in the first \nand second studies registered moderately high levels of anxiety (M = 101.83 and 99.60, respectively). In the \nthird study, participating learners demonstrated moderate  anxiety levels (M = 98.24). However, as a whole, the \nlearners across all three studies were moderately highly anxious (M = 99.70). The largest plurality of participants \nin the three studies was highly anxious (37.77% in the first study, 34.33% in the second study, and 33.10% in the \nthird study). Scores for the learners with moderately high  levels of anxiety were the second highest in the three \nstudies (22.47% in the first study, 20.47% in the second study, and 19.90% in the third study). A minority of \nlearners demonstrated moderately low levels of langua ge anxiety across the three st udies (6.96% in the first \nstudy, 11.94% in the second study, and 12.23% in the third study). Learners in the first study demonstrated \nsimilar levels of moderate and very low anxiety (16.50% and 16.30%, respectively), and these values were \nsimilar to those for the corresponding anxiety levels of the learners in the second study (15.99% and 17.27%). \nFindings in the third study were rather different; learners  demonstrated identical levels of moderately high and \nvery low anxiety (19.90%). However, the moderate anxiety level scored by learners in this study (14.87%) \nremains similar to those reported by learners in the fi rst two studies. Over one third of the full sample of \nparticipants (35.21%) reported high levels of anxiety as the top percentage, and 21.02% were moderately highly \nanxious learners. Nearly one fifth of all learners (17.71%) had very low anxiety levels, with 15.84% having \nmoderate anxiety and only 10.22% having moderately low anxiety.  \nAn item analysis was performed to identify the survey items that attracted the highest mean scores and were thus \nrecognized by respondents as the main causes of FLA. Three items obtained the highest mean scores out of all \nsurvey items and thus represented the major fears of Saudi l earners in their language classes. As seen in Table 3, \nitem 12 (“ In language class, I can get so nervous that I forget things I know ”) obtained the survey’s highest \nmean score (M = 3.65). Item 9 (“ I start to panic when I have to speak without preparation in language class ”) \nwas the second-highest anxiety-provoking concern for learners (M = 3.64). The third-highest cause of learners’ \nanxiety was item 33 (“ I get nervous when the language teacher asks questions that I haven’t prepared for in \nadvance” [M = 3.60]). The first item (12) is indicative of learners’ fear of being unable to remember things that \nthey already know or of their propensity to “go blank” with  regard to what they intend to say due to the anxiety \nthat they generally feel in language class. The ot her two items (9 and 3) represent learners’ fear of \ncommunicating in foreign language classes because of lack of preparation, which has been established by \nprevious research as a significant cause of students’ reluctance to participate in English language class, leading to \nFLA (Hamouda, 2013; Tsui, 1996). In Table 3, the items of the FLCAS are ranked in descending order of the \nmean based on participants’ responses in this study. \n \n \n \n \nwww.ccsenet.org/elt English Language Teaching V ol. 7, No. 7; 2014 \n87 \n \nTable 3.

As noted by \nGuilloteaux and Dörnyei (2008, p. 69), social science studi es typically detect meaningful correlations within the \n0.3–0.5 range. Thus, we excluded items with an absolute correlation value under 0.3. Twenty-seven items out of \n33 loaded identically on the extracted factors in the three studies, confirming that the sources of anxiety reported \nby participants were considerably similar. Twelve items (1, 3, 7, 9, 13, 19, 20, 23, 24, 27, 31, and 33) were \nindexed as the first FLCAS component. These items are indicative of learners’ apprehension about \ncommunicating in English in class as a result of their fe ars of being negatively evaluated by their teacher and \npeers, and they are also attributab le to the negative comparisons that students create between themselves and \nother EFL learners. This factor was therefore labeled “communication anxiety”. \nSix items (4, 6, 12, 15, 25, and 29) reflected the second component of the FLCAS. These items reflect learners’ \nfear of not being able to understand and follow the teacher, and thus, they were referred to as “comprehension \napprehension”. \nSix items (8, 10, 17, 26, 28, and 30) constituted the third FLCAS component. These items represent a number of \nthe feelings and negative perceptions that learners typi cally express regarding their English language classes. \nThus, this factor was referred to as “negative attitudes toward English class”. This factor received loading from \nitems featuring learners’ fear of language testing (e.g., items 8 and 10), which indicates that language test anxiety \ncould be a contributing factor to the negative attitudes with which learners frequently approach their English \nlanguage classes.  \nThe fourth factor attracted loadings from items 11, 14, and 32 and was labeled “lack of anxiety” to indicate the \nlearners’ ability to approach English language class and to communicate in the foreign language with no anxiety.  \nItems 16, 18, 21, and 22 loaded differently. Although item 16 loaded highly on factor 2 (r = .556) in the first \nstudy, it also loaded significantly on factor 3 in the se cond and third studies (rs = .554 and .540, respectively). \nThus, item 16 was considered a component of the third factor (negative attitude toward English class). Item 18 \nloaded significantly on factor 1 in the first and third st udies (rs = .430 and .562) and on the fourth factor in the \nsecond investigation (r = .528). Thus, it was consider ed a component of learner’s communication anxiety (i.e., \nthe first factor). Despite the significant loading of item 21 on factor 2 (r = .408) in the third study, this item was \nadded to factor 3 because it loaded highly on this factor in the first and second studies (rs = .709 and .587, \nrespectively). Item 22 loaded significantly on factor 3 in the first and second studies (rs = .558 and .449) and on \nfactor 4 in the third study (r = .529). This item was considered a component of factor 3 (negative attitudes toward \nthe language class).  \nItems 2 and 5 did not load significantly in the three studies. As seen in Table 4, item 2 did not load significantly \non any of the factors in the third study; the same was true for item 5 in the second study. This indicates that these \ntwo items do not represent Saudi learners’ perceptions of  their anxiety, and thus, they were not included as \ncomponents of the factors that emerged as sources of learners’ language anxiety in this context. \n \nTable 4.

The second factor, comprehension apprehension, explained 16.34%, \n16.06%, and 15.58% of the total variance in the first, second, and third studies. The third source of anxiety, \nattitudes toward English class, accounted  for 13.56%, 15.08%, and 14.36% of the variance in the first, second, \nand third studies, respectively. The fourth factor, lack of anxiety, explained 13.18%, 12.67%, and 12.21% of the \ntotal variance in the first, second, and third studies, re spectively. All four factors had Cronbach’s alpha values \ngreater than .60 and can therefore be considered reliable. In short, the figures reported in Table 4 indicate that the \nanxiety that Saudi EFL learners expe rienced in the classroom originated from a variety of sources. Based on \nthese figures, Saudi learners’ sources of FLA in their EFL classes were communication anxiety, comprehension \napprehension, and negative attitudes toward English class. The fourth emerging factor was indicative of learners’ \nlack of anxiety and could thus not be regarded as a sour ce of anxiety even though it was significantly correlated \nwith the other three extracted  factors (see Table 5). The final reliability  coefficients of the extracted factors \n(sources of language anxiety) and the Pearson correlations among these sources for the full sample of learners in \nthe current study are presented in Table 5. \n \n \nwww.ccsenet.org/elt English Language Teaching V ol. 7, No. 7; 2014 \n90 \n \nTable 5.

Discussion \nThe figures in Table 2 indicate that th e study’s respondents were highly anxious. There are a number of reasons \nbehind the prevalent feelings of anxiety in Saudi EFL clas ses. These factors concern the learner, the teacher, and \nthe teaching and learning procedures and environment.  \nWith regard to the learner, Saudi learners’ low English language proficiency levels (Al-Khairy, 2013; Alqahtani, \n2011) are a major contributor to the feelings of anxiety that they tend to have when learning English. Previous \nresearch has found that students with low proficiency leve ls are largely more anxious than those with high FL \nproficiency (Young, 1991). In a similar vein, the low perceived self-esteem with which Saudi EFL learners \ntypically begin and the negative social comparisons with  peers as a result of competitiveness in class could \ncontribute to language anxiety (Hamouda, 2013). In this regard, it is implied that language learners who compare \nthemselves with an idealized self-image (Bailey, 1983)  and those with low self-perceived ability levels in a \nsecond/foreign language (Young, 1991) are most likely to experience language anxiety. The shy and reluctant \npersonality of Saudi EFL learners communicating in th e foreign language (Hamouda, 2013) and their lack of \nmotivation (Alzayid, 2012; Khan, 2011) could be considered two learner traits that contribute to their language \nanxiety. The lack of group membership  with peers, which results from the la ck of cooperative learning in Saudi \nEFL classes, could also be considered a learner characteristic that leads to anxiety. The erroneous and unrealistic \nbeliefs that Saudi learners typically hold regarding foreign language learning are a major contributor to language \nanxiety. Alrasheed (2012) and Daif-Allah (2012) noted so me of the frequent miscon ceptions, for example, that \nmastering a foreign language is an overwhelming task that  requires special learning abilities and a reasonable \namount of intelligence, that younger lang uage learners are more successful th an adults, that learning a foreign \nlanguage is a matter of only memorizing vocabulary words and grammatical rules, that a learner is supposed to \nbe fluent or have a perfect accent in the foreign language,  that learners should unde rstand every word they read \nor hear in the language class, and that speaking in the FL should be grammatically perfect. All of these faulty \nbeliefs give learners unrealistic expectations about th e language learning process, cause them to become \ndisappointed and frustrated, and thus lead to anxiety (Alrabai, 2014a; Palacios, 1998; Tallon, 2008; Young, \n1991).  \nPrevious research (Price, 1991; Shabani, 2012; von W őrde, 2003; Young, 1990) has acknowledged that the \nlanguage teacher is considered the key player in studen ts’ anxiety. EFL teacher characteristics and behavior in \nthe Saudi context are considered major factors that evoke student anxiety (see Al-Saraj, 2013). Some but not all \nsuch practices include the absence of teacher support, unsympathetic teacher personality, negative evaluations of \nstudent performance, lack of time for personal attention,  threatening questioning styles, intolerance with learner \nerrors, overcorrection of students’ mistakes or correction in a harsh way, and the sense of being judged by the \nteacher or wanting to impress the t eacher. According to Williams and Burden  (1997), instructor s’ beliefs about \nlanguage teaching, which affect everything they do in the classroom, could be another cause of language anxiety \nfor Saudi learners. Aida (1994) found that teachers’ beliefs are closely linked to student fears. Most EFL teachers \nin this context believe that it is necessary for the teacher to be intimidating at times, the instructor is supposed to \ncorrect every single mistake made by the students, group and pa rtner work is not appropriate because it can get \nout of control, the teacher should do mo st of the talking in class, and the teacher is the ultimate controller and \nleader of the class.  \nwww.ccsenet.org/elt English Language Teaching V ol. 7, No. 7; 2014 \n91 \n \nTeaching procedures is the third major cause of  FLA in the Saudi EFL context. The traditional \ngrammar-translation teaching method is frequently used, which focuses primarily on grammatical accuracy in the \nwritten rather than spoken form of the language. Some activities, particularly those that demand that students \nspeak in front of the class, have been found to be highly anxiety provoking (Hamouda, 2013). The assessment \nprocedures used in Saudi EFL classes, including those that depend primarily on written tests, and the continuous \nevaluation and overcorrection of learners’ errors, significantly contribute to learners’ anxiety. Besides, many EFL \ninstructors in this context make the classroom a time for performance rather than a ti me for learning. The strict \nand formal learning environment in Saudi Arabia is a fundamental factor in learne r anxiety. Tanveer (2007) \nstated that learners in the Saudi EFL context view the classroom as a place where mistakes are noticed and \ndeficiencies are pointed out. Saudi pa rticipants in Tanveer’s study reported that they found the language \nclassroom extremely stressful because it was formal, thei r performance was constantly monitored and evaluated \nby their teacher and peers, and they were generally blamed for the errors they made in class. One male Saudi \nstudent said, “I get conscious, don’t want to make mistakes in the class, teacher will put this in the mind and will \ngive grades at the end...” According to Tanveer (2007), among many others, large EFL class size in Saudi Arabia \nis another factor that tends to limit student involvement in class discussions and promote some form of the \nteacher-centered environment. \nThe previous studies conducted in the Saudi EFL context have identified a variety of sources of FLA among \nSaudi English language learners. Abu-Ghararah (1999) has acknowledged three sources of FLA among the Saudi \nEFL learners recruited in his study: non-facilitative negative feelings, mastery of listening and conversation, and \ninteractive approach. As part of his study on anxiety coping strategies, Alrabai (2014a) recognized fear of \nnegative evaluation, communication apprehension, and negative attitudes toward English class as the main \nsources of FLA for Saudi EFL learners. In comparison w ith earlier findings, we noted that the sources of FLA \nidentified in the present study were in line with the sources identified in previous studies, which supports the \nexistence of these sources among Saudi EFL learners.   \n5.1 A Model of FLA in the Saudi EFL Context \nBased on the substantially consistent findings from the EFA, we concluded that an FLA model could be \nproposed for Saudi EFL learners. When  closely examining the factors that emerged from the EFA, we note that \nthe respondents’ FLA fell into two main categories: language use anxiety and language class-related anxiety. \nThis categorization is consistent with that provided by Gardner (1985) for language anxiety in his \nsocial-psychological model.  \nLanguage use anxiety relates to the an xiety that learners experience when  they attempt to communicate in the \nforeign language in class. Based on the findings of a further EFA on our data, this type of FLA is featured by \nvariables including speaking anxiety (items 1, 3, 9, 18, 20, and 24 in the survey), fear of negative evaluation by \nteacher and peers (items 13, 19, 27, 31, and 33), and social-image anxiety (items 7 and 23).  \nIn our model, language class anxiety entails comprehension-related anxiety (items 4, 6, 12, 15, 25, and 29), \nnegative attitudes toward language class  (items 16, 17, 22, 26, 28, and 30), and language test anxiety (items 8, \n10, and 21).  \nAs shown in Table 6, all of the main components and their subcomponents in the model were significantly \ncorrelated. The two main constructs in the model (language use anxiety and language class anxiety) had a highly \nsignificant correlation (r = 685). All of the variables in the model demonstrated strong reliability (> .60) . These \nreliability scores and the significant correlations among the model’s components confirm the proposed model’s \nvalidity. Moreover, each of the two main components in the model had highly significant correlations with their \nsubcomponents and lower correlations with the subcomponents of the other component (see Table 6). This \nfurther validates the categorization followed in the model. \n \nTable 6.

All correlations among variables are significant at the .01 level (p < .01).  \n \nThe first component of the proposed FLA model (language use anxiety) displayed highly significant correlations \nwith its subcomponents. The highest correlation was between this component and speaking anxiety (r = .938), \nwhich indicates that language use anxiety stems mainly fro m speaking anxiety. It is no t surprising that speaking \nanxiety was a major barrier to using the foreign language in Saudi EFL classes. This finding validates the \nconclusion of MacIntyre and Gardner (1991) that speaking is the most anxiety provoking of all second/foreign \nlanguage activities. It is also in line with those of Al -Sibai (2005), who reported that speaking was perceived as \nthe most anxiety-provoking aspect of language learni ng among the Saudi female university students who took \npart in her study. Wu (2010) pointed out that one of the striking reasons for learner reticence in EFL contexts was \nthe lack of experience in speaking English because most  L2 learners communicate in their mother language \noutside of the classroom. Wu added that students in this environment lack confidence in their spoken English and \nbecome anxious when they need to use English as a ve hicle for communication (p. 176). This is true for Saudi \nlearners of English because in a country such as Saudi Arabia, where English is a foreign language, learners do \nnot have the opportunity to practice this language in thei r daily life and their exposure to it is minimal. The only \ncontext in which Saudi learners are able to practice English is at school, which is not the best place to be exposed \nto the language. Schools are typica lly anxiety-provoking contexts (Iiz uka, 2010) because in most school \nsituations, learners are required to perform in front of th eir peers, are put on the spot unpredictably, work in fear \nof making mistakes, worry about failing exams, may have their mistakes over-corrected, and may have fears \nover their low proficiency in the foreign language. These pr actices ignite and intensify the feelings of anxiety in \nlearners and make communicating in the language class their greatest concern.  \nFear of negative evaluation had a highly significant correlation with language use anxiety (r = .913), confirming \nit as another significant obstacle that prevents learners from using English in the language class. Kitano (2001) \ninvestigated FLA sources and found that fear of negative evaluation was a si gnificant source for this \nphenomenon. Fear of negative evaluation also had a strongly significant correlation with speaking anxiety ( r \n= .766), which confirms that anxious learners avoid bei ng involved in speaking activities in class because of a \nfear that they will be negatively evaluated by their teacher or fellow students. This is validated by the findings of \nthe EFA analysis of the present stud y in that communication anxiety comprised fear of negative evaluation, and \nis also in line with the conclusions of MacIntyre and Gardner (1989) and Tsiplakides and Keramida (2009) who \nmaintained that communication anxiety usually involves fear of negative evaluation. \nSocial-image anxiety had a lower, but still significant and high ( r = .719), correlation with language use anxiety, \nconfirming that it is also a contributing factor to keeping students from using the foreign language properly in \nclass. This verifies that Saudi EFL learners usually focus on the social aspects of language learning which makes \ntheir self-images and identities dependent on their relationships with their peers and consequently can influence \ntheir FLA. This component also had si milar significant correlations with speaking anxiety (r = .561) and fear of \nnegative evaluation (r = .553); the two behaviors that are considered a threat to students’ social image and are \npotential sources of anxiety. Neer ( 1982) argues that peer comp arisons do contribute to  speech anxi ety because \nwww.ccsenet.org/elt English Language Teaching V ol. 7, No. 7; 2014 \n93 \n \nanxious students do not like to be compared with excellent speakers. Moreover, Kitano (2001) argued that \namong all of the skills taught in the FL class, speaking is typically the first skill with which learners compare \nthemselves with peers, teachers, and native speakers. Furthermore, Kitano (2001) and Tsiplakides and Keramida \n(2009) concluded that students were experiencing En glish language speaking anxiety as a result of their \nself-perceptions of low ability in relation to their peer s. Additionally, Aydin (2008) found that anxious students \nwho generally perceived their communication as less efficient than that of their peers had a tendency to compare \nthemselves with the others in the classroom and to adopt competitive behaviors, which creates language anxiety.  \nThe second component of the model ( language class anxiety ) had highly significant correlations with its \nsubcomponents as well. This component was mainly featured by the negative attitudes learners generally held \ntoward language class ( r = .867). Similarly, comprehension apprehension was also a significant factor in \nintensifying learners’ language class-related anxiety in  that it had a highly significant correlation with this \nvariable (r = .843). Test anxiety was a third factor that evoked learners ’ class anxiety since it was significantly \ncorrelated with class anxiety (r = .790).  \nMany previous studies (Alrabai, 2014a; Linh, 2011; Na, 2007; Zhang, 2010) have experimentally identified \nnegative attitudes toward English class as a source of FLA. There are a vari ety of causes of negative attitudes \ntoward foreign language classes. Khodadady and Khajavy (2013) found that learners who lacked motivation to \nlearn the foreign language had negative attitudes toward English class as well as English communication fear, \nfear of negative evaluation, and discomfort in class. In  the absence of direct cont act with native speakers of \nEnglish in Saudi Arabia, Saudi learners do not generally use English for communicative purposes but rather \nstudy it as a requirement for academic or career purposes. However, this diminishes the value of learning English \nin Saudi learners’ views, and it generates their negative attitudes toward learning this language. In addition, most \nSaudi EFL learners do not possess the basic proficiency necessary for even simple conversations, which \nexaggerates their negative attitudes toward English langua ge classes. In addition, the unpleasant past English \nlearning experiences that the majority of learners in the Saudi context have had, the unrealistic expectations, \nfalse beliefs, and misconceptions that those learners approach their language classes with negatively impact their \nattitudes toward learning English.  \nAtasheneh and Izadi (2012) found that comprehension anxiety  can negatively influence the process of \ncommunicating in the foreign language given that listening  and speaking are two interrelated skills that make \ncommunication possible (p. 183). Comprehension anxiety  in the proposed model concerns listening \ncomprehension, for which students generally have one opportunity to comprehend the spoken language, as \nopposed to reading comprehension, for which students can always return to what they do not understand and \nanalyze it. There are a variety of cau ses to which the comprehension anxiety experienced by Saudi EFL learners \ncould be attributed. The first is that Saudi learners are generally not sufficiently exposed to the foreign language. \nMost of these learners do not experience even a single case of communication with a native English speaker \nthroughout the process of English language learning because of the fact reported by (Kim, 2000) that the context \nof foreign language learning classes does not provide adequate listening comprehension moments due to the \ninadequacy of real-time communication opportunities. In the Saudi EFL setting, most class time is devoted to \nreading and grammar rather than listening and speaking. Another reason for comprehension anxiety among Saudi \nEFL learners is the lack of sufficient listening comprehension material in the curriculum that has been developed \nfor English language teaching in Saudi  schools and universities. The nature of the materials used for listening \ncomprehension, the speed of the message delivered by in structors, the pronunciation (e.g., British or American), \nthe topic of the listening material, the length of this material, and the level and familiarity of the vocabulary used \nin listening could be other comprehension anxiety-provoking factors. \nLanguage test anxiety was the third subcomponent of classroom-related anxiety. Past research has confirmed that \ntest anxiety among EFL learners is a significant factor that detrimentally affects different aspects of the EFL \nlearning process (Aida, 1994; Ayidn, 2009; Petridou & Williams, 2007). Aydin, Yavuz, and Yesilyurt (2006) \nexplained that test anxiety causes physical and ps ychological problems; negatively affects motivation, \nconcentration, and achievement; prevents students from re flecting their actual performance in their test results \nand from studying efficiently; and reduces interest in language learning. Joanna, Hernandez, and Margaret (2003) \nestablished that test anxiety has negative effects on the oral proficiency of language learners. Young (1990), on \nthe other hand, reported that language test anxiety is one reason for the negative attitudes toward the foreign \nlanguage learning process. This has been validated by the results of EFA analysis in the present study since items \nconcerning test anxiety in the survey loaded significantly under the ‘negative attitudes toward English class’ \nfactor.  \nThere exist certain factors that cause test anxiety in foreign language learning; including the Saudi EFL setting. \nwww.ccsenet.org/elt English Language Teaching V ol. 7, No. 7; 2014 \n94 \n \nYoung (1999) identified some sources of language test anxiety, such as perceptions of test validity, time limits \nand associated pressures, test techni ques, test formats, test length, testing environment, and clarity of test \ninstructions. Besides, Aydin (2009) reported that other test anxiety-provoking factors included low learner \nproficiency, the negative attitudes of teachers toward test procedures, students’ attitudes toward language \nlearning, test invalidity, fear of negative evaluation, bad experiences on tests (e.g., low grades), the difficulty of \ncourse content, lack of familiarity with the question types, and parental expectations.

A proposed model of FLA in the Saudi EFL context \n \n6. Conclusions, Implications, Recommendations, and Limitations \nThis large-scale investigation explored Saudi learner’s FLA levels and sources in the course of learning English \nas a foreign language. The Saudi respondents who took part in this study were generally highly anxious EFL \nlearners, with communication anxiety, comprehension apprehension, and negative attitudes toward English class \nbeing their main sources of anxiety. An FLA model in the Saudi EFL context was proposed based on the \nsubstantially very similar, and occasio nally identical, findings of the three st udies in relation to the sources of \nlearners’ FLA. The model comprised two main componen ts that relate to language use, and class-related \nanxieties, as well as subcomponents that fell within th ese two categories, including speaking anxiety, fear of \nnegative evaluation, social-image anxiety, negative attitudes toward English class, comprehension anxiety, and \nlanguage test anxiety.  \nThe study’s contribution includes investigating the levels and sources of FLA among a large population of Saudi \nlearners over a long period of time, which could allow us to draw valid conclusions and generalizations about the \nconcept of anxiety in the Saudi EFL context. The FLA model proposed based on this study’s conclusions is a \nmajor contribution that might be beneficial in increasing awareness among Saudi EFL learners, instructors, and \npolicymakers of FLA and its sources and causes. This awareness could help in addressing these sources and \ncould ultimately improve the outcomes of the EFL learning and teaching process in Saudi Arabia. More \ngenerally, the proposed model could help in FLA investigations in many other EFL contexts aside from the Saudi \ncontext.  \nThe results of the current research indicate that the anxiety associated with learning English as a foreign \nlanguage in the Saudi context is a complex and multidimensional phenomenon. For this reason, this study \nprovides a range of implications and recommendations for the varied elements of the EFL teaching and learning \nForeign language Anxiety in the Saudi EFL Context \nLanguage use \nanxiety \nLanguage class \nanxiety \nSpeaking anxiety \nFear of negative \nevaluation\nSocial-image \nanxiety \nComprehension anxiety \nNegative attitudes \ntoward English class \nLanguage test anxiety \nwww.ccsenet.org/elt English Language Teaching V ol. 7, No. 7; 2014 \n95 \n \nprocess in Saudi Arabia: the teacher, the learner, and the EFL policymakers in this context.  \nGiven the significant role of instructors in the amount of anxiety students experience in language classes, we \nbelieve that it is the instructor who has the supreme role in alleviating language anxiety among learners. Tanveer \n(2007) indicated that FLA considerations by a language  teacher are highly important in assisting them in \nachieving the intended performance goals in the target language. Thus, most of the recommendations presented \nby the current study are for English language teachers . These teachers should first and foremost acknowledge \nFLA’s existence as legitimate, and they should find effective strategies to help learners cope with its destructive \nfeelings. There are many recent resources that EFL teachers in Saudi Arabia should consult because they present \npractical means of addressing learner anxiety (Alrab ai, 2014b; Hashemi & Abbasi, 2013; Kondo & Ling, 2004; \nNagahashi, 2007; Tallon, 2008; Tsiplakides & Keramida , 2009). In addition to reducing learners’ anxiety, \nteachers should also build students’ confidence and self-esteem in their foreign language abilities via \nencouragement, reassurance, positive reinforcement, and empathy. Teachers should create a warm atmosphere to \nmotivate their students to learn English because motivation is negatively and significantly related to anxiety; thus, \nincreased student motivation leads to decreased anxiety. Therefore, language teachers should motivate their \nstudents to decrease their anxiety in English class. In th is regard, Dörnyei (1994) indicated that helping students \nto set goals that are not overly easy or difficult to accomplish and setting r ealistic expectations of students are \ntwo techniques that can be used to motivate students and reduce their anxiety about learning a foreign language.  \nWith respect to speaking anxiety, teachers should remi nd their students that speaking anxiety is not only \ncommon among Saudi learners but is a universal phenomenon among foreign language learners. A primary step \nin helping learners with speaking anxiety is to become  familiar with students’ attitudes toward oral production \nand to shed light on the reasons that underlie their un willingness to engage in speaking activities (Tsiplakides & \nKeramida, 2009). Students should be provided with as much opportunity as possible to practice speaking in the \nclassroom. Opportunities such as English clubs inside th e school should be introduced to students to increase \ntheir opportunities to practice the language. Classroom activities can also be linked to club activities and daily \nlife. For example, students can be asked in the class to report on their participation in the clubs, or they can share \ntheir daily life experiences with their classmates. \nIn relation to the learning environment and learning procedures, teachers can decrease language learners’ anxiety \nby creating friendly, relaxing, informal, and learning-supportive environments for language learning through \ntheir friendly, helpful, and cooperative behavior, making students feel comfortable in the language class. \nLanguage teachers should avoid beginning their lessons w ith activities that enhance learners’ early frustrations. \nInstead, they should start with simple, step-by-step activ ities that enable learners to feel relaxed and gradually \ninvolved in class activities.  Teachers must adopt communicative teachi ng approaches that provide language \nlearners who have limited exposure to English with more opportunities to practice their speaking skills, and they \nmust increase students’ engagement in class activit ies. Certain learning activities, such as creating \nproblem-solving situations and working through language problems through pair work, group work, games, and \nsimulations, could be useful in this respect. Because  Saudi learners’ low competence in English could be \nattributed partially to lack of vocabulary and inability to master English sentence structures, it is recommended \nthat activities to build the students’ vocabulary be conducted. An atmosphere of warmth, communality, solidarity, \nand friendship should be created among the students themselves to reduce the negative impact of peers’ \nperceptions and evaluations of each other. \nTeachers should be cautious  and demonstrate a positive response to st udents’ errors. In th is respect, teachers \nshould inform students that mistakes are not a sign of failure but rather a no rmal aspect of the language learning \nprocess and that it is through making errors that one ac quires language proficiency. As a positive response to \nstudents’ concerns over the harsh ma nner of teachers’ error correction, teachers’ error correction techniques \nshould be based on instructional philosophy and on reducing defensive reactions in students, as recommended by \nHorwitz et al. (1986). \nTo eliminate comprehension anxiety, instructors may teach specific listening strategies to help students listen \nmore effectively and cope with their comprehension fear s. Students should be trained to listen for the main \npoints and to not expect themselves to understand every word while listening. In addition, when teachers feel \nthat students are lagging behind and not following the material, teachers can turn to the learners’ native language \nto clarify the point and then shift ba ck to the target languag e (Atasheneh & Izadi, 20 12). Moreover, teachers \nshould pay special attention to selecting listening passages that are at an appropriate level of difficulty for the \nstudents. \nWith respect to language test anxiety, test makers should provide learners with a relaxed testing atmosphere, test \nwww.ccsenet.org/elt English Language Teaching V ol. 7, No. 7; 2014 \n96 \n \ncontent should range from easy to difficult, and test instructions and grading criteria should be clear to students. \nStudents should be exposed to practice tests before they sit for the real test and should be given sufficient time to \ncomplete their exams.  \nThis study recommends that learners themselves talk openly with their t eachers, other students, and family \nmembers about their feelings of anxiety because such communication can alleviate these feelings (Campbell & \nOrtiz, 1991).  \nEFL policymakers in the Saudi context should involve En glish teachers in pre-service and in-service training \nprograms on general psychology, including language anxiety. Such programs might be beneficial in enhancing \nteachers’ level of FLA awareness and thus enable them to  address the learners’ feelings of stress and anxiety in \ntheir classes. To address the problem of overcrowded classes, students should be assigned to small groups. In this \nregard, academic institutions in Saud i Arabia must eliminate the monoton ous bureaucracy and equip learners \nwith adequate learning space (i.e., more classrooms) and well-qualified teachers. \nDespite this study’s valuable contributions, further FLA re search is needed. There is a need to subject the FLA \nmodel proposed in this study to further testing and validation in both the Saudi and other EFL/ESL contexts. The \nFLA model proposed here was constructed based on learners’ responses to only a self-report survey (the FLCAS). \nA multi-method investigation that examines learners’ perceptions of their anxiety using classroom observations, \ninterviews, diary writing, an d self-reporting instruments would help in constructing a model based on solid and \nmore valid conclusions.  \nFuture research could investigate the relationship between the variables in the FLA model proposed by the \ncurrent study and learners’ achievements in the foreign language. This could be determined by a longitudinal \nstudy that investigates the different aspects of learner anxiety and achievement over different periods of time and \nestablishes any correlations between these two variables to determine the anxiety variables that most affect \nlearners’ achievement.  \nFinally, this research was more concerned with investigating the general sources of anxiety among learners and \ndid not explore the relationship between these sources and language learning skills. A further suggestion for \nfuture research here is to investigate the sources of FLA for specific language skills, such as reading, writing, and \nlistening. Research in this ar ea will shed light on the sources that lead to anxiety regarding these skills and how \nthese sources can be addressed. \nReferences \nAbu-Ghararah, A. H. (1999).
