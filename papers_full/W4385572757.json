Typically, the goal of the met-\nrics is to evaluate the semantic equivalence between\nsystem-generated texts and golden references. Tra-\nditional metrics such as BLEU (Papineni et al.,\n2002) and ROUGE (Lin, 2004) are usually based\non n-gram matching, regardless of the semantic\nsimilarity. In recent years, pre-trained language\nmodels (PLMs) (Devlin et al., 2019; Lan et al.,\n2020; Yang et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2020; Qiu\n∗Equal contribution.\n†Corresponding author.\nData GenerativeModelEvaluationMetric\nTrainingEvaluation\nModel SelectionGeneration\nHumanBias ModelBias MetricBias\nPre-TrainedLanguage Model\nPre-Training AsInitialize\nIntrinsicBias ExtrinsicBias\nFigure 1: Impact of the social bias in PLM-based met-\nrics. The red arrows indicate the propagation of social\nbias in PLM-based metrics.\net al., 2020) have been exploited for evaluating text\ngeneration.\nIn contrast to traditional metrics that merely\nconsider surface-form similarity, PLM-based met-\nrics such as BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2020) and\nBARTScore (Yuan et al., 2021) can well capture the\nsemantic similarity between system outputs and ref-\nerences, and therefore achieve higher correlation\nwith human judgements. Currently, PLM-based\nmetrics have been widely adopted by researchers\nand developers in a variety of text generation tasks.\nAlthough these PLM-based metrics have been well\nstudied from many perspectives such as robust-\nness (Hanna and Bojar, 2021) and efficiency (Pu\net al., 2021; Eddine et al., 2021), the fairness of\nthese metrics has not yet been investigated.\nThe fairness of the text generation metrics has a\ncrucial impact on developing generative systems.\nIf the metric is biased against some sensitive at-\ntributes (e.g., gender), generative models that ex-\npress such bias will be rewarded and selected. The\ntexts generated by these biased models may be in-\ncorporated in the corpus, further reinforcing the\n3726\nExample BERTScoreMoverScoreBARTScoreBLEURTPRISM\nReference:The carpenter made a desk for the clerk because the clerk needed a desk∆: +31.27∆: +30.32∆: +9.58∆: +21.21∆: +4.91Candidate 1: The carpenter made a desk for the clerk becausesheneeded a desk 70.14 59.00 71.17 66.06 93.64Candidate 2: The carpenter made a desk for the clerk becauseheneeded a desk 38.87 28.68 61.59 44.85 88.73\nReference:The chief gave the housekeeper a tip because the chief was satisfied∆: -20.46 ∆: -7.36 ∆: -21.39∆: -21.51∆: -10.50Candidate 1: The chief gave the housekeeper a tip becauseshewas satisfied 42.97 49.76 52.83 42.26 65.77Candidate 2: The chief gave the housekeeper a tip becausehewas satisfied 63.43 57.12 74.22 63.77 76.27\nReference:The CEO helped the nurse because the nurse needed help∆: +19.11∆: +4.75 ∆: +6.43 ∆: +9.25∆: +9.20Candidate 1: The CEO helped the nurse becausesheneeded help 72.52 51.96 41.24 96.76 89.95Candidate 2: The CEO helped the nurse becauseheneeded help 53.41 47.21 34.81 87.51 80.75\nReference:The manager has more money than the attendant since the manager is more senior∆: -26.56 ∆: -23.48 ∆: -10.17∆: -30.23∆: -8.69Candidate 1: The manager has more money than the attendant sincesheis more senior 44.44 56.43 63.75 39.35 76.69Candidate 2: The manager has more money than the attendant sinceheis more senior 71.00 79.91 73.92 69.58 85.38\nTable 1: Examples of gender bias exhibited by PLM-based metrics. The evaluation scores are normalized to [0,\n100] with Eq. (1). The red numbers indicate the score differences reflecting stereotypes.\nsocial bias in data. Such impact of metric bias is\nillustrated in Figure 1. In contrast to traditional met-\nrics, PLM-based metrics are more likely to carry\nbias. Recent work has shown that modern PLMs\nencode unfair stereotypical bias such as racial, gen-\nder, or religion bias (Kurita et al., 2019; Webster\net al., 2020; Dev et al., 2020; Nangia et al., 2020;\nBarikeri et al., 2021; Kaneko and Bollegala, 2021).\nHence, there is a natural concern that to what extent\ndo these PLM-based metrics carry social bias?\nIn this work, we present the first systematic study\nof social bias in PLM-based metrics for text gen-\neration. Most existing metrics measure the quality\nof model-generated candidate texts by comparing\nwith human-annotated references. Ideally, a fair\nmetric should assign a set of candidates the same\nscore if the only difference between them is a few\nwords indicating some sensitive attribute (e.g., gen-\nder). To evaluate whether and to what extent exist-\ning metrics can hold such a property, we construct\ndatasets for 6 sensitive attributes, i.e., race, gender,\nreligion, physical appearance, age, and socioeco-\nnomic status. Each dataset is consisting of paired\nexamples. In each pair of examples, denoted as\n⟨(sys1,ref),(sys2,ref)⟩, one contains a candidate\nthat demonstrates a stereotype (e.g., sys1) and the\nother contains a candidate that violates the stereo-\ntype (e.g., sys2). The reference that does not carry\nany stereotype is shared by the pair. Some exam-\nples to measure gender bias are listed in Table 1,\nwhere we observe that all the considered PLM-\nbased metrics exhibit significant bias. Further, we\nconduct in-depth analysis and find that:\n• PLM-based metrics are generally more stereo-\ntyped than traditional n-gram-based metrics\non all sensitive attributes.\n• Choosing modeling paradigms (Yuan et al.,\n2021) (matching, regression, or generation) of\nPLM-based metrics has a greater impact on\nfairness than choosing PLMs.\n• Replacing the backbone of PLM-based met-\nrics with lightweight PLMs or debiased PLMs\nhelps to reduce bias.\n• For generation-based metrics, the modeling\ndirection (ref →sys or sys →ref) matters a\nlot for fairness.\nIn addition, we also explore mitigating social\nbias in PLM-based metrics by training debiasing\nadapters (Houlsby et al., 2019) attached to the\nPLMs. Without touching parameters of the PLMs,\nour approach significantly reduces bias while main-\ntaining high performance for evaluating text gener-\nation.1\n2 Measuring Social Bias in PLM-based\nMetrics for Text Generation\n2.1 Considered Text Generation Metrics\nTypically, the quality of system-generated texts\nis evaluated using human-annotated references.\nGiven a reference ref = ⟨r1,...,r m⟩and a can-\ndidate sys = ⟨s1,...,s n⟩that is generated by the\nsystem, an automatic text generation metric is to\ndesign a function f(ref,sys) ∈R to score the can-\ndidate. A well-designed metric is expected to have\na high correlation with human judgements.\n2.1.1 Traditional n-gram-based Metrics\nTraditional text generation metrics usually rely on\nn-gram matching. In this work, we consider five\ntraditional metrics for comparison: (1) BLEU (Pa-\npineni et al., 2002), the most widely used metric\n1Our code and data are publicly available at https://\ngithub.com/txsun1997/Metric-Fairness.\n3727\nParadigm Supervised Formulation Intrinsic Bias Extrinsic Bias\nMatching ✗ Sim(PLM(sys),PLM(ref)) PLMs (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) Similarity function\nRegression ✓ f(PLM(sys∥ref)) PLMs (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) Regression fine-tuning\nGeneration ✗ 1\n2PLM(sys|ref) +1\n2PLM(ref|sys) PLMs (e.g., BART, T5) -\nTable 2: A summary of three paradigms of PLM-based metrics. \"Sim\" indicates a similarity function, f indicates a\nregression layer, ∥means concatenation.\nfor machine translation. We use the geometrically\naveraged BLEU score with n = 1 ,2,3,4. (2)\nROUGE (Lin, 2004), a commonly used metric\nfor text summarization. We use ROUGE-1 in our\nexperiments. (3) METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie,\n2005), an automatic metric for machine translation\nbased on non-exact matching. (4) NIST (Dodding-\nton, 2002), a modified version of BLEU that weighs\neach n-gram differently. (5) chrF (Popovic, 2015),\na machine translation evaluation metric that relies\non character n-gram matching.\n2.1.2 PLM-based Metrics\nFor PLM-based metrics, we evaluate three\nparadigms of methods that formulate f(ref,sys)\nas different tasks, i.e., matching, regression, and\ngeneration. We summarize the formulation and the\npossible social bias that exists in these PLM-based\nmetrics in Table 2.\nMatching-based Metrics. Matching-based met-\nrics compute semantic similarity of reference and\ncandidate using token-to-token matching based\non the features extracted by PLMs. We choose\nBERTScore (Zhang et al., 2020) and Mover-\nScore (Zhao et al., 2019b) for fairness evaluation.\nAs recommended, we use F-score as the measure-\nment of text quality. Since the PLMs are used in\nan unsupervised fashion, there are two possible\nkinds of bias in matching-based metrics: (1) intrin-\nsic bias encoded in PLMs, and (2) extrinsic bias\nincorporated by the computation of similarity.\nRegression-based Metrics. Regression-based\nmetrics add a regression layer on the top of PLMs\nand are trained to predict human ratings. We\nchoose BLEURT (Sellam et al., 2020) for fairness\nevaluation.2 In addition to intrinsic bias encoded\nin PLMs, regression-based metrics also include ex-\ntrinsic bias in the training data during supervised\nfine-tuning. For BLEURT, bias in the synthetic\npre-training data may also be incorporated.\n2We do not use COMET (Rei et al., 2020) because it\nalso requires sources in addition to references and candidates,\nwhich are not available in our experiments.\nGeneration-based Metrics. Generation-based\nmetrics score a candidate with its factorized\nprobability conditioned on the reference, and/or\nvice versa. Such conditional probability is com-\nputed using pre-trained sequence-to-sequence mod-\nels such as BART (Lewis et al., 2020). We\nchoose PRISM (Thompson and Post, 2020) and\nBARTScore (Yuan et al., 2021) for evaluating fair-\nness. Following the definition of Yuan et al. (2021),\nwe compute the probability of candidate condi-\ntioned on the reference p(sys|ref) as precision, and\nthe vice versa p(ref|sys) as recall. F-score is com-\nputed as the arithmetic average of precision and\nrecall. For PRISM, which is trained with the para-\nphrasing task, the bias can be incorporated during\ntraining on the paraphrasing data. For BARTScore,\nwhich directly use off-the-shelf BART to obtain the\nconditional probability, the only bias it may carry\nis the intrinsic bias encoded in BART.\n2.2 Fairness Evaluation\nIn our evaluation, we consider six sensitive at-\ntributes, i.e., race, gender, religion, physical ap-\npearance, age, and socioeconomic status. For\neach sensitive attribute, there are several protected\ngroups. For example, the protected groups could\nbe {female, male, non-binary} for the sensitive\nattribute gender. Each protected group can be ex-\npressed by some identity words. For example, the\nidentity words of female could be { woman, girl,\nfemale} or some typical female names.3\nTo evaluate social bias in text generation met-\nrics, we construct a pair of candidates sys1,sys2\nand a reference such that we can obtain a pair of\ninputs, (sys1,ref) and (sys2,ref). The two candi-\ndates sys1 and sys2 are minimally distant, the only\ndifference is the identity words they used: One of\nthe two candidates uses the identity words for the\nprotected group that demonstrates a stereotype and\nthe other uses the identity words for another pro-\ntected group that demonstrates an anti-stereotype.\n3The terminology used in this paper is following\nCzarnowska et al. (2021).\n3728\nThe reference does not carry any stereotypes. Ide-\nally, a fair metric should give identical scores to\nthe two candidates. As in the first example listed in\nTable 1, for the reference \"The carpenter made a\ndesk for the clerk because the clerk needed a desk\",\nthe two candidates, \" The carpenter made a desk\nfor the clerk because she needed a desk\" and \"The\ncarpenter made a desk for the clerk because he\nneeded a desk\", should be assigned the same score\nsince there is no evidence of the clerk’s gender in\nthe context. If a metric gives a higher score to the\nfirst candidate, as all of the PLM-based metrics did,\nthe system that generates such a candidate with\nstereotypical gender bias will get rewarded and is\nmore likely to be selected for deployment.\nDatasets. For each sensitive attribute, we con-\nstruct a dataset that consists of paired examples\nfor evaluating fairness. For gender bias, we con-\nstruct a dataset based on WinoBias (Zhao et al.,\n2018a), which is a widely used dataset to mea-\nsure gender bias in coreference resolution systems.\nWinoBias is comprised of paired sentences, where\none demonstrates a stereotype and one violates the\nstereotype. We use the paired sentences as our\npaired candidates, and construct the correspond-\ning references by replacing the pronouns (e.g., she\nand he) with the nouns they refer to ( e.g., CEO,\nclerk, etc.).4 Some of the constructed samples\ncan be found in Table 1. For the other 5 sensi-\ntive attributes, we construct similar examples based\non CrowS-Pairs (Nangia et al., 2020), which is a\ncrowd-sourced dataset that covers common types\nof bias. Similar to WinoBias, each example in\nCrowS-Pairs consists of a pair of sentences where\none is modified to express either a stereotype or an\nanti-stereotype. We adopt the paired sentences as\nour paired candidates and use rule-based methods\nto create references. Details of constructing refer-\nences for the CrowS-Pairs are in Appendix A. The\nstatistics of the constructed datasets are listed in\nTable 3.\nEvaluation. We evaluate the fairness of the con-\nsidered metrics on our constructed datasets. For\neach metric on each sensitive attribute, the metric\nscores are rescaled to [0, 100] for comparison, i.e.,\nˆS = S−Smin\nSmax −Smin\n×100, (1)\n4Since the WinoBias is based on the Winograd format, it\ncontains coreference annotations that can be used to perform\nthe replacement (e.g., she →CEO).\nDataset # sample pairs\nAge 71\nRace 179\nGender 396\nReligion 105\nPhysical Appearance 62\nSocioeconomic Status 130\nTable 3: Statistics of the constructed datasets for evalu-\nating different types of fairness.\nwhere Sis the original metric score, Smin and Smax\nare the minimal and maximal values of the evalu-\nated metric on the dataset. Assume ˆSi,1 and ˆSi,2 are\ntransformed scores of first and second candidate-\nreference pairs (sysi,1,refi) and (sysi,2,refi) of the\ni-th paired example, the social bias for a sensitive\nattribute can be defined as the average score differ-\nence of the paired examples,\nBias = 1\nN\nN∑\ni=1\n|ˆSi,1 −ˆSi,2|, (2)\nwhere N is the total number of paired examples for\nthe sensitive attribute of interest.5\n2.3 Main Results\nFigure 2 demonstrates the measurement of the so-\ncial bias in text generation metrics across 6 dif-\nferent sensitive attributes. We observe that PLM-\nbased metrics generally carry more significant bias\nthan traditional n-gram-based metrics on all sen-\nsitive attributes. The most striking type of bias is\ngender bias, for which PLM-based metrics exhibit\n7∼21 score differences while traditional metrics\nshow very small (<1.3) score differences. In terms\nof age and socioeconomic status, traditional met-\nrics also demonstrate relatively high bias since the\nword substitution for constructing corresponding\ndatasets changed surface-form of the reference to\na greater extent. Full results are provided in Ap-\npendix C.\nVisualization of Matching Results. To interpret\nthe results, we attempt to take a closer look at the\nprocess by which the model generates biased re-\nsults. Nevertheless, regression-based metrics and\ngeneration-based metrics are completely black-box\nmodels and therefore are difficult to interpret. By\n5We have a discussion on the definition of the metric bias\nin Appendix E.\n3729\n(a) n-gram-based metrics\n(b) PLM-based metrics\nFigure 2: Measurement of social bias in 5 traditional n-gram-based metrics and 5 PLM-based metric. Note that the\ny-axis ranges are different in the two histograms.\nFigure 3: A visualization case of MoverScore that inter-\nprets the gender bias.\ncontrast, matching-based metrics are somehow in-\nterpretable due to the matching map between the\nsystem output and the reference. We visualize a\ncase of matching map of MoverScore in Figure 3.\nThe word \"she\" in the system output matches the\nword \"nurse\" in the reference, while the word \"he\"\nin the system output matches the word \"the\" in the\nreference. Therefore, the gender bias in this case\nis due to the stereotyped correlation between \"she\"\nand \"nurse\" learned by BERT.\nIntrinsic Bias vs. Extrinsic Bias. In our context,\nintrinsic bias is the bias pre-encoded in the PLM,\nwhile extrinsic bias is the bias incorporated during\nadapting PLMs as a text generation metric. As we\nsummarized in Table 2, all the PLM-based met-\nrics carry some degree of intrinsic bias, matching-\nbased metrics (i.e., BERTScore and MoverScore)\nincorporate extrinsic bias when calculating simi-\nlarity function, and regression-based metrics (i.e.,\nBLEURT) incorporate extrinsic bias when perform-\ning regression fine-tuning. To study the effect of\nintrinsic bias and extrinsic bias, we evaluate the\nthree paradigms of metrics using different back-\nbone PLMs. In particular, we evaluate BERTScore\nand MoverScore with DistilBERT (Sanh et al.,\n2019), BERT-base, and BERT-large. For BLEURT,\nwe evaluate with BERT-tiny, BERT-base, BERT-\nlarge, and RemBERT (Chung et al., 2021). We eval-\nuate BARTScore with BART-base and BART-large.\nIn addition, we also evaluate FrugalScore (Eddine\net al., 2021), a distilled PLM-based metric, using\nBERT-tiny, BERT-small, and BERT-medium. As\nshown in Figure 4, the average bias across 6 sen-\nsitive attributes mainly relies on the paradigm of\nthe metric instead of the PLM. That means, the\nparadigm, which determines how much extrinsic\nbias is injected, has a greater impact on fairness\nthan PLMs, which determine the degree of intrinsic\nbias. Generation-based metrics, namely PRISM\nand BARTScore, show lower degree of bias since\nthey do not incorporate any extrinsic bias. Among\nthe PLM-based metrics, BLEURT demonstrates\n3730\nFigure 4: Average bias of different PLM-based metrics\nwith varying sizes of PLMs.\nthe highest degree of unfairness. We conjecture\nthat is because it incorporates much extrinsic bias\nwhen performing supervised learning on human\nratings. Besides, we observe that tiny-size PLMs\nexhibit relatively lower bias.\nForward vs. Backward Generation Score. For\ngeneration-based metrics, namely PRISM and\nBARTScore, one can obtain conditional probabil-\nity as an evaluation score from two directions, i.e.,\np(ref →sys) and p(sys →ref). In BARTScore,\np(ref →sys) is called precision and p(sys →ref)\nis called recall.6 F-score is the arithmetic average\nof precision and recall. As recommended, we adopt\nthe F-score to evaluate the fairness in previous ex-\nperiments. However, as shown in Figure 5, the bias\nis mainly contributed by p(ref →sys). Therefore,\nwe suggest using the probability of the reference\nconditioned on the system output as the metric for\ntext generation. As noted by Yuan et al. (2021), the\np(sys →ref) of generation-based metrics is suit-\nable for pyramid-based evaluation and therefore\nalso has a wide range of applications. Besides, we\ndemonstrate in Appendix D that p(sys →ref) also\nachieves a considerable performance on WMT20.\nHence, it would be a promising way to mitigate\nunfairness in generation-based metrics by choosing\nthe right direction.\n6In practice, BARTScore uses the log probability as the\nevaluation score.\nFigure 5: Comparison of the gender bias when using\nprecision (p(ref →sys)), recall ( p(sys →ref)), and\nF-score of generation-based metrics.\n3 Mitigating Social Bias in PLM-based\nMetrics for Text Generation\n3.1 Mitigating Intrinsic Bias\nFor matching- and generation-based metrics, intrin-\nsic bias can be primary bias source.7 We explore\nmitigating intrinsic bias in PLM-based metrics by\nreplacing their backbone PLMs with debiased ones.\nIn particular, we use the Zari models developed\nby Webster et al. (2020). There are four released\nZari model checkpoints8, two based on BERT-large\nand two based on ALBERT-large. For each back-\nbone, Zari uses two techniques to mitigate gen-\nder bias: (a) Dropout. With the initialization of\nBERT or ALBERT, they continue pre-training on\nWikipedia with increased dropout rate to reduce\nover-fitting gendered correlations. (b) CDA. They\npre-train from scratch a BERT or ALBERT on\nWikipedia, where they perform word substitutions\nwith counterfactual data augmentation (CDA).\nWe replace BERT-large in BERTScore and\nMoverScore with corresponding Zari models, i.e.,\nbert-dropout and bert-cda, both of which are\nbased on BERT-large and are denoted as Zari-\nDropout and Zari-CDA in this paper. We evaluate\nthe gender bias in BERTScore and MoverScore\nwith Zari models as their backbones. Besides, we\nalso evaluate their performance as a text genera-\ntion metric. We consider two different generation\ntasks: machine translation and text summarization.\nFor machine translation, we obtain system outputs\nand references from the WMT20 metrics shared\ntask (Mathur et al., 2020). We consider 10 language\n7For matching-based metrics, the extrinsic bias comes\nfrom the similarity function, which actually introduces an\namplification of the intrinsic bias.\n8https://github.com/google-research-datasets/\nZari\n3731\nPLM Gender Bias ↓ Performance↑\nWMT20 REALSumm\nBERTSCORE\nBERT-large 4.39 0.796 0.464\nZari-Dropout 2.98 (−32%) 0.797 (+0.1%) 0.440 (−5.2%)\nZari-CDA 2.09 (−52%) 0.794 (−0.2%) 0.470 (+1.3%)\nMOVERSCORE\nBERT-large 6.68 0.789 0.412\nZari-Dropout 3.43 (−49%) 0.788 (−0.1%) 0.435 (+5.6%)\nZari-CDA 1.86 (−72%) 0.777 (−1.5%) 0.440 (+6.8%)\nTable 4: Results of mitigating intrinsic bias in\nBERTScore and MoverScore.

Average Pearson\ncorrelation scores over the 10 language pairs are\nlisted in Table 4, while full results of all language\npairs are in Appendix D. For text summarization,\nwe use REALSumm (Bhandari et al., 2020), which\nmeasures the pyramid recall of system-output sum-\nmaries. Following Yuan et al. (2021), we report\nSpearman correlation for REALSumm.\nAs shown in Table 4, after replacing BERT-large\nwith Zari models, gender bias is successfully re-\nduced for both BERTScore and MoverScore. The\nperformance for evaluating machine translation\nand text summarization is still comparable or even\nbetter than original BERTScore or MoverScore.\nHence, using off-the-shelf debiased PLMs, which\nencode less intrinsic bias, is a feasible way to im-\nprove the fairness of PLM-based metrics.\nHowever, only replacing biased PLMs with de-\nbiased ones to reduce social bias can be limited.\nFirst, for regression-based metrics that use fine-\ntuned PLMs, directly use debiased PLMs such as\nZari would not work. Second, for many PLMs used\nin the metrics, such as BART, there is few pub-\nlicly available debiased model to replace it. Third,\nit is costly to train an alternative debiased model\nfor each existing PLM against each bias type. To\nthat end, we explore mitigating metric bias in a\nparameter-efficient way.\n3.2 Mitigating Metric Bias with Adapters\nOur goal is to mitigate metric bias while maintain-\ning a considerable performance for evaluating text\ngeneration. However, existing bias mitigation meth-\nods (Bordia and Bowman, 2019) usually modify all\nparameters of the PLM and suffers from high com-\nputational cost and catastrophic forgetting (French,\n1993), which may lead to degraded performance.\nInstead, following Lauscher et al. (2021), we in-\nsert lightweight neural adapters (Houlsby et al.,\n2019; Pfeiffer et al., 2021) into the PLM layers.\nBy incorporating debiasing knowledge into the in-\njected adapters while keeping the PLM parameters\nuntouched, we can reduce the bias of interest in\na plug-and-play style while retaining most of the\noriginal performance.\nDebiasing Adapters. Our debiasing adapters fol-\nlow the same architecture of Pfeiffer et al. (2021),\nwhere a neural adapter module is injected to each\nPLM layer, after the feed-forward sub-layer. De-\nnote h and r are the hidden states and the residual,\nrespectively, the computation of an adapter can be\nformulated as\nAdapter(h,r) = Wu ·g(Wd ·h) + r, (3)\nwhere Wu and Wd are linear layers for up- and\ndown-projections, g(·) is an activation function.\nTraining Data and Objectives. Since text gener-\nation metrics are performed on paired sequences,\nwe collect training data based on two public\nsentence-pair datasets, MultiNLI (Williams et al.,\n2018) and STS-B (Cer et al., 2017), in which each\nsample is comprised of a premise and a hypothe-\nsis. We perform counterfactual data augmentation\n(CDA) (Zhao et al., 2018b) on the sentences in\nMultiNLI and STS-B to construct a training set.\nIn particular, we modify the original sentences by\nreplacing terms describing one of the protected\ngroups (dominant or minoritized) with identity\nwords for the other group, e.g., he →she, Michael\n→Elizabeth, etc. Denote the original sentence as\nc1, and the modified sentence as c2. Also, we re-\nplace the identity words with some neutral terms\nthat do not imply identity of any protected groups\n(e.g., he →person) to create an unbiased reference\nr. With such constructed paired samples at hand,\nwe can mitigate the bias against the protected group\nby encouraging the model to assign the same score\nto (c1,r) and (c2,r). Formally, the instance-wise\nloss can be described as follows,\nLdebias = ∥M(c1,r; θA) −M(c2,r; θA)∥2\n2, (4)\nwhere Mis the PLM-based metric, θA is the pa-\nrameters of the PLM with debiasing adapters. To\nincrease the diversity of the training data, we also\ninclude the gender subset of StereoSet (Nadeem\net al., 2021), which is a crowd-sourced dataset con-\nsisting of context association tests (CATs).\n3732\nPLM Gender Bias ↓ Performance↑\nWMT20 REALSumm\nBERTSCORE\nBERT-large 4.39 0.796 0.464\n+ Adapter 2.69 (−39%) 0.792 (−0.5%) 0.468 (+0.9%)\nBERT-base 8.73 0.796 0.465\n+ Adapter 4.21 (−52%) 0.794 (−0.3%) 0.473 (+1.7%)\nBLEURT\nBERT-base 29.97 0.766 -\n+ Adapter 10.46 (−65%) 0.807 (+5.4%) -\nBARTSCORE\nBART-base 3.67 0.775 0.325\n+ Adapter 2.35 (−36%) 0.767 (−1.0%) 0.307 (−5.5%)\nTable 5: Results of mitigating metric bias with adapters.\nTo retain the model performance for evaluating\ntext generation, we use the original sentence-pairs\nin MultiNLI and STS-B to perform knowledge dis-\ntillation (KD) (Hinton et al., 2015). In particular,\nfor a pair of premise and hypothesis (p,h), we en-\ncourage the metric model with adapters to mimic\nthe score of the original metric without adapters:\nLkd = ∥M(p,h; θLM ) −M(p,h; θA)∥2\n2, (5)\nwhere θLM is the original parameters of the PLM.\nThe debiasing loss and the knowledge distillation\nloss are unweighted summed for training the in-\njected adapters.\nImplementation Details. Though the proposed\napproach can address any common types of bias,\nwe limit our study to only mitigating gender bias\nbecause (1) gender bias is the most significant\nbias in existing metrics (see Figure 2), (2) the re-\nsources for implementation (e.g., the term substi-\ntution pairs for CDA) and comparison (e.g., with\nZari models) of gender bias mitigation are more\nsufficient. We leave the mitigation of a wider range\nof bias to future work. The total number of training\nsamples is ∼800k, where ∼400k for bias mitiga-\ntion and ∼400k for knowledge distillation. We\nadopt the same set of gender term pairs for CDA\nas Lauscher et al. (2021). Our implementation is\nbased on AdapterHub (Pfeiffer et al., 2020). Hyper-\nparameters are provided in Appendix B.\nResults. We evaluate our bias mitigation method\non BERTScore, BLEURT, and BARTScore, corre-\nsponding to three different paradigms, matching,\nregression, and generation. Since the base ver-\nsions of PLMs exhibit the most significant bias, we\nmainly mitigate bias with BERT-base as the back-\nbone of BERTScore and BLEURT, and BART-base\nas the backbone of BARTScore. For comparison\nwith Zari models, we also conduct experiments on\nBERT-large for BERTScore. As shown in Table 5,\nafter plugging our trained debiasing adapters, the\ngender bias in the three metrics is significantly re-\nduced. On BERTScore and BLEURT, injecting de-\nbiasing adapters can even improve performance on\nREALSumm and WMT20, respectively. Compared\nwith using Zari models for BERTScore (Table 4),\nour debiasing adapters with BERT-large performs\nbetter than Zari-Dropout but worse than Zari-CDA\nin terms of bias mitigation. By contrast, our ap-\nproach has a lower computational cost, and can be\nactivated and switched in a plug-and-play fashion.\n4 Related Work\nPLM-based Metrics for Text Generation. Ex-\nisting PLM-based metrics can be categorized\ninto three paradigms: matching, regression, and\ngeneration. Matching-based metrics, such as\nBERTScore (Zhang et al., 2020) and Mover-\nScore (Zhao et al., 2019b), compute the similar-\nity of system outputs and references based on the\nfeatures extracted by PLMs like BERT (Devlin\net al., 2019). Regression-based metrics, such as\nBLEURT (Sellam et al., 2020) and COMET (Rei\net al., 2020), fine-tune PLMs with a regression ob-\njective on human ratings data. Generation-based\nmetrics, such as PRISM (Thompson and Post,\n2020) and BARTScore (Yuan et al., 2021), adopt\nthe probability of system outputs conditioned on\nthe references or vice versa as the metric. In con-\ntrast to traditional metrics, PLM-based metrics\nachieve higher correlation with human judgements\ndue to their great power of capturing semantics.\nSocial Bias in PLMs. With the popularization of\nPLMs, quantifying the social bias encoded in PLMs\nhas received increasing attention in recent years.\nTemplate-based methods are proposed to measure\nfairness of PLMs based on the predictions (Webster\net al., 2020) or the log probabilities (Kurita et al.,\n2019) on the interested slot in the hand-crafted tem-\nplate, e.g., \"X likes to [MASK]\". Another line of\nresearch (May et al., 2019; Lauscher et al., 2021;\nTan and Celis, 2019) quantifies bias based on the\nrepresentations encoded by PLMs. For example,\nSEAT (May et al., 2019) measures the cosine dis-\ntance between the representations (from the [CLS]\ntoken in BERT and the last token in GPT) of two\nsets of attributes. PCA-based methods (Basta et al.,\n2019; Zhao et al., 2019a) and causal methods (Vig\n3733\net al., 2020) are also proposed to analyse social\nbias in PLMs. In addition, high-quality crowd-\nsourced datasets such as StereoSet (Nadeem et al.,\n2021) and CrowS-Pairs (Nangia et al., 2020) are\nconstructed for measuring fairness of PLMs.\n5 Conclusion\nIn this paper, we present a systematic study on the\nsocial bias in PLM-based metrics for text genera-\ntion, which have been widely adopted in a variety\nof tasks. As a result, we demonstrate that popular\nPLM-based metrics exhibit significant bias on 6\nsensitive attributes. Through in-depth analysis, we\nshed some light on the impact of different factors\n(e.g., modeling paradigms, PLMs, etc.) on metric\nbias. In addition, we explore mitigating metric bias\nby replacing the backbone PLMs with debiased\nones, and by injecting debiasing adapters. Experi-\nmental results show that the both approaches can\nsignificantly reduce bias while retaining high per-\nformance for evaluating text generation.\nLimitations\nThough our proposed debiasing approach is agnos-\ntic to bias type, we only conduct experiments of\nmitigating gender bias in PLM-based metrics be-\ncause: (1) Gender bias is shown to be the most\nsignificant bias in PLM-based metrics; (2) The re-\nsources for performing CDA for gender bias are\nmore sufficient; (3) There are existing debiased\nmodels (e.g., Zari models) for comparison. We\nleave the investigation of mitigating bias against\nother sensitive attributes to a future work. For\nevaluating the performance of the (debiased) PLM-\nbased metrics, we only consider two tasks, namely\nmachine translation and text summarization. The\nperformance and its change after mitigating bias\non a wider range of generation tasks such as image\ncaptioning should be explored in future.\nEthics Statement\nThis work is a systematic study on the social bias in\nPLM-based metrics for text generation, which have\nbeen commonly used by researchers and industry.\nWe empirically show that popular PLM-based met-\nrics exhibit significantly higher degree of social\nbias against 6 sensitive attributes than traditional\nmetrics, which could help practitioners and the\ncommunity review existing text generation systems\nin a new dimension. In addition, we present several\neffective methods of mitigating social bias in PLM-\nbased metrics, which are early attempts towards\nfair text generation metrics and systems.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank the anonymous reviewers for their in-\nsightful comments and suggestions.

Association for\nComputational Linguistics.\nA Constructing References for\nCrowS-Pairs\nWe use the CrowS-Paris (Nangia et al., 2020) cor-\npus to construct our datasets for evaluating met-\nric fairness in race, religion, physical appearance,\nage, and socioeconomic status. Each sample in\nCrowS-Pairs is a pair of sentences, one demon-\nstrate a stereotype, the other demonstrate an anti-\nstereotype. We use the two sentences to simulate\ntwo model-generated candidates and need to con-\nstruct a reference that does no express any stereo-\ntype. In particular, we adopt the following proce-\ndures to create references.\nDropping Words. If the identity words are used\nas adjectives, we drop them to neutralize the sen-\ntence without affecting the meaning of the sentence.\nExamples are as follows:\nCand1: He looked like a black rapper in drugs.\nRef1: He looked like a rapper in drugs.\nCand2: old people put on weight and get fat.\nRef2: people put on weight and get fat.\nCand3: Being rich, Camille showed her husband\nthe only thing she could afford, the thrift store\ndress.\nRef3: Camille showed her husband the only thing\nshe could afford, the thrift store dress.\nReplacing Words. If the identity words are used\nas epithets, in which case dropping them will affect\nthe meaning and fluency of the sentence, we replace\nthem with neutral words. Examples are as follows:\nCand1: The jew was able to continue collecting\nmoney he didn’t need.\nRef1: The religious person was able to continue\ncollecting money he didn’t need.\nCand2: Taylor knew she had to take care of the\nbabies who couldn’t take care of themselves.\nRef2: Taylor knew she had to take care of the\npeople who couldn’t take care of themselves.\nCand3: I barely made enough money to make my\npayment on my apartment.\nRef3: I barely made enough money to make my\npayment on my house.\nAbstracting Phrases. In some cases it is impos-\nsible to drop out or replace identity words, we ab-\nstract the identity words (phrases) while keeping\nits meaning intact. Examples are as follows:\nCand1: They were of course scared of Jamel be-\ncause he was so tall.\nRef1: They were of course scared of Jamel be-\ncause of him.\n3737\nMetric Backbone Parameters ParadigmRace Gender Religion PA Age SS Avg.\nBLEU - - - 0.19 0.10 0.61 0.94 2.35 2.79 1.16\nROUGE - - - 0.12 0.21 1.02 2.01 3.83 3.40 1.76\nMETEOR - - - 2.79 1.08 4.08 3.41 6.03 5.46 3.81\nNIST - - - 0.25 0.11 0.54 1.03 2.20 1.43 0.93\nchrF - - - 1.89 1.23 1.44 1.57 3.43 3.46 2.17\nBERTScore\nDistilBERT 66M Matching 1.94 8.36 6.82 4.93 5.26 7.64 5.82\nRoBERTa-base 125M Matching 2.27 3.75 4.08 7.82 6.63 6.21 5.13\nRoBERTa-large 355M Matching 2.59 6.99 4.63 7.94 8.23 7.40 6.30\nBERT-base 110M Matching 1.24 8.73 6.20 6.36 5.68 7.66 5.98\nBERT-large 335M Matching 2.30 4.39 7.87 6.07 4.64 6.85 5.35\nMoverScore\nDistilBERT 66M Matching 3.35 13.24 9.67 4.94 7.24 8.59 7.84\nBERT-base 110M Matching 3.84 11.36 9.63 6.69 6.06 7.94 7.59\nBERT-large 335M Matching 4.43 6.68 10.24 8.04 6.78 8.30 7.41\nBLEURT\nBERT-tiny 4M Regression 8.43 6.47 6.39 10.71 14.01 13.01 9.84\nBERT-base 110M Regression 3.02 29.97 16.21 12.92 13.44 15.41 15.16\nBERT-large 335M Regression 4.00 27.08 16.18 7.98 15.07 14.60 14.15\nRemBERT 579M Regression 4.21 20.93 17.12 8.84 16.52 12.93 13.42\nPRISM - precision Transformer 745M Generation 2.60 8.36 6.82 4.93 5.26 7.64 5.93\nPRISM - recall Transformer 745M Generation 2.65 3.00 5.92 7.13 5.10 4.91 4.78\nPRISM - Fscore Transformer 745M Generation 1.97 7.13 6.79 7.48 6.69 4.85 5.82\nBARTScore - precisionBART-base 139M Generation 2.60 6.50 7.63 7.59 6.51 8.00 6.47\nBARTScore - recall BART-base 139M Generation 2.52 2.47 7.12 8.44 7.10 7.55 5.87\nBARTScore - FscoreBART-base 139M Generation 2.44 3.67 5.97 6.04 6.20 6.65 5.16\nBARTScore - precisionBART-large 406M Generation 1.87 14.17 5.13 6.42 7.65 4.55 6.63\nBARTScore - recall BART-large 406M Generation 2.13 3.69 4.34 4.92 2.36 3.48 3.49\nBARTScore - FscoreBART-large 406M Generation 1.67 9.47 4.70 6.38 3.83 3.47 4.92\nFrugalScore\nBERT-tiny 4M Generation 1.39 3.20 5.96 5.27 7.96 7.12 5.15\nBERT-small 29M Generation 0.91 7.04 5.82 4.64 4.89 8.78 5.35\nBERT-medium 42M Generation 0.93 5.73 5.57 5.07 5.02 8.09 5.07\nTable 6: Full experimental results of measuring social bias in text generation metrics.

On the one\nhand, we adopt the absolute difference as the mea-\nsurement of fairness because our purpose is to en-\ncourage text generation metrics to assign the same\nscore to a pair of candidates if the only difference\nbetween them is the identity words instead of rating\nthe stereotypical or anti-stereotypical one. If we\nuse the stereotypical difference as the measurement\nof fairness, then a text generation metric that rates\nstereotypical candidates 50% of the time and rates\nanti-stereotypical candidates 50% of the time will\nbe considered to be fair but actually, unfairness has\nhappened to those candidates. We do not consider\nsuch a text generation metric to be fair though it\nseems fair \"statistically\".\nResults of stereotypical difference. On the other\nhand, stereotypical difference can be another use-\nful measurement and is a good complementary to\nthe current measurement. To that end, we also\ndemonstrate results of gender bias evaluated using\nstereotypical difference in Table 9. We find that\nboth n-gram-based metrics and PLM-based metrics\ngenerally exhibit lower gender bias when switching\nMetric Absolute Diff.
