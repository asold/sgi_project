  "abstract": "Periodical calibration is necessary to ensure the accuracy and reliability of voltage transformers. The traditional calibration method requires the power to be off, and the calibration period for this method is too long, meaning that problems with the transformer cannot be found in time. In this paper, a voltage transformer error online calibration system based on open–closed capacitors is proposed. Two open–closed capacitors and other auxiliary devices are utilized to construct the standard voltage sensor. The outputs of the open–closed capacitors are compared with each other to realize accurate self-checking. The average value of the output is used as the final output, which can improve the system’s accuracy and reliability. An improved algorithm based on a hybrid convolution window is proposed to extract the fundamental and harmonic signals. Test results show that the variation of the ratio error is less than 0.037%, and the variation of the angle error is less than 0.45’.",
