    "abstract": "Transformers are imaginary hard robots that could deform into various shapes according to external circumstances, and the development of intelligent soft Transformers is of great interest. Herein, novel remotely controlled soft Transformers based on a shape memory hydrogel system is proposed. The hydrogel is obtained by embedding Fe 3 O 4 magnetic nanoparticles into a poly( N ‐(2‐hydroxyethyl) acrylamide)‐gelatin double network structure. The reversible coil‐triple‐helix transformation of gelatin renders the hydrogel with shape memory and self‐healing behaviors. The introduction of Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles provides both photothermal heating and magnetic manipulation functions. The hydrogel can deform on navigation in a magnetic field, and the deformed shape can be fixed and shape recovery can also be accomplished with the assistance of light irradiation. Taking advantage of the magnetically driven actuation and light‐assisted shape memory, remotely controlled shape memory process can be accomplished. Moreover, a series of soft robots, including hydrogel athlete which can do sit‐ups, hydrogel Transformers that can deform and navigate through a maze, hydrogel space station and hydrogel spacecraft that can be docked in the air, are fabricated. This work will inspire the design and fabrication of novel smart polymer systems with synergistic functions.",
