  "abstract": "This paper deals with the problem of the leakage inductance calculations in power transformers. Commonly, the leakage flux in the air zone is represented by short-circuit inductance, which determines the short-circuit voltage, which is a very important factor for power transformers. That inductance is a good representation of the typical power transformer windings, but it is insufficient for multi-winding ones. This paper presents simple formulae for self- and mutual leakage inductance calculations for an arbitrary pair of windings. It follows from a simple 1D approach to analyzing the stray field using a discrete differential operator, and it was verified by the finite element method (FEM) calculation results.",
