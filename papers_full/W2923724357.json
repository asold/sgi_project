INTRODUCTION\nOil immersed power transformers are widely used in power\nsupply and distribution systems. At present, insulation failure\nis the main cause of transformer failure [1]. The internal\ninsulation of an oil-immersed transformer is comprised of an\noil-paper insulation system. Because the oil sample is easy\nto obtain during operation, the ageing state of the oil can\nbe conveniently detected and ageing oil can be replaced by\nnew oil [2]–[4]. However, due to the electric ﬁeld and thermal\neffects, the ageing state of oil-immersed paper or paperboard\nis uneven. In addition, it is difﬁcult to extract oil-immersed\npaper sample nondestructively from a transformer [5], [6].\nThe insulative and mechanical properties would be damaged\nirreversibly once deterioration occurred. Hence, the ageing\ndegree of the oil-immersed paper determines the insulation\nstate of transformer [7]–[9].\nTo address the condition monitoring of transformer oil-\npaper insulation, the present assessment methods include\nanalysis of furaldehyde, the dissolved gas analysis (DGA),\nthe recovery voltage method (RVM), polarization and depo-\nlarization current (PDC) and frequency dielectric spec-\ntroscopy (FDS). The degree of polymerization ( DP) is\nan important basis for assessing the ageing condition\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Mehdi Bagheri.\nof paperboard. Many studies have shown that DP had a\nsigniﬁcant relationship with furaldehyde and other dissolved\ngases in oil [10]–[12]. DGA is a widely used online monitor-\ning method. However, the analysis of furaldehyde and DGA\nare both inﬂuenced by the replacement of oil [4], [13], [14].\nRVM, PDC and FDS are dielectric response method. The\nﬁrst two are implemented in the time domain, and FDS is\nimplemented in the frequency domain. Nevertheless, these\nmethods cannot assess the local ageing in oil-paper insulation\ncaused by uneven electrothermal effects [15]–[17], and the\nresults may be affected by the oil.\nIn conclusion, current condition assessment methods for\noil-paper insulation fail to distinguish the insulation condition\nat various regions in transformer internal insulation. To solve\nthis problem, a new approach, the iterative inversion method\nfor oil-immersed paper resistivity, is put forward in [27].\nReference [27] explores the method of resistivity inversion\nand uses ﬁnite element electrostatic ﬁeld simulation to realize\nthe inversion of resistivity based on the steady-state insulation\nresistance. To ascertain more input, this paper explores the\nfeasibility of tanδas an inversion input. Then, this paper takes\nthe tan δ at low frequency and the dielectric parameters of\noil as inputs to calculate the oil-immersed paper resistivity\nin various regions of the transformer based on ﬁnite element\ntime harmonic ﬁeld simulations. Meanwhile, the inﬂuence of\nthe initial value on the inversion algorithm is discussed.\n44050\n2169-3536 \n 2019 IEEE.

Ruanet al.: Inversion of Oil-Immersed Paper Resistivity in Transformer Based on Dielectric Loss Factor\nII. INVERSION CONCEPT\nSome parameters that characterize the physical model may\nnot be obtained directly from the external measurements.\nTo obtain the information of these parameters, it is neces-\nsary to infer these through some measured values, which\nare related to the parameters. This process is known as\ninversion, which infers the internal parameters of the model\naccording to the external observed data [18]. For exam-\nple, resistivity inversion has been widely used in geophys-\nical exploration, especially in mineral and hydrogeological\nexploration [19], [20].\nBecause transformers are sealed, it is very difﬁcult to\nobtain the ageing state of oil-immersed paper directly. There-\nfore, the resistivity inversion method is applicable to this\nproblem. This method use external measurable parameters\nto infer the material parameters of internal oil-immersed\npaper and use this parameter as a reference for the internal\ninsulation state. The mapping relationship between external\nmeasurability (tanδat low frequency) and the internal ageing\ncharacteristics of the transformer (oil-immersed paper resis-\ntivity) is established by ﬁnite element simulation as follows.\nF(x) =y (1)\nwhere x is the internal ageing transformer characteristic, and\ny is the external measurability. F is the mapping relationship\nobtained by ﬁnite element simulation. Based on these map-\nping relationships, values for x are calculated inversely.\nA. OUTPUT OF INVERSION\nThe ageing of oil-immersed paper will cause a change in\ndielectric parameters. During the ageing process of oil-\nimmersed paper, the interaction between the molecules is\nweakened gradually, accompanied by the production of polar\nsubstances, which cause a decrease in oil-immersed paper\nresistivity. Reference [21] showed that the conductivity of oil-\npaper increases with the increased ageing. This is because\ncellulose pyrolysis produces ageing by-products, such as car-\nboxylic acid, which results in an increase in the number of\ncarriers and a decrease in resistivity. Reference [15] drew\nsimilar conclusions. High conductivity will increase local\ndielectric loss, cause overheating and accelerate ageing [22].\nTherefore, resistivity is one of the indexes reﬂecting the\ninsulation state of oil-immersed paper. Meanwhile, DP is\ngenerally accepted as an effective basis for evaluating the age-\ning state of oil-immersed paper, which can effectively reﬂect\nthe insulation state of oil-immersed paper [23]–[25]. Some\nresearchers have established the relationship between DP and\nthe resistivity of oil-immersed paper in [26] by experiments,\nas shown in Fig. 1. The oil of No. 25 and No. 45 represents\ndifferent kinds of oil. The relation between the DP and the\nresistivity is derived as (2). Due to (2), the oil-immersed paper\nresistivity is closely related to DP.\nρ=A ×DPK (2)\nwhere A and K are constants, and ρ is the resistivity of\noil-immersed paper in ·m.\nFIGURE 1. Relationship between DP and oil-immersed paper resistivity in\n[26].\nB. INPUT OF INVERSION\nIn [27], steady-state insulation resistance was used as inver-\nsion input. However, the input is too singular, which is not\nconducive to the division of ageing regions. To solve this\nproblem, this paper explores new inputs. The following con-\ntent analyses the feasibility of using low-frequency dielectric\nloss factor as input. Under alternating current (AC) voltage,\nU(t) =Umsinωt, where Um is the voltage amplitude in V , and\nωis the angular frequency in rad/s, According to [28], the def-\ninition of dielectric loss factor tan δof a single dielectric is,\ntan δ=ε′′\nε′ =1/(ωε0ρ) +χ′′(ω)\n1 +χ′(ω) (3)\nwhere ε′ and ε′′ are the real and imaginary part of\nthe complex permittivity, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity\nof 8.85 ×10−12 F/m, χ′(ω) and χ′′(ω) are the real and imag-\ninary part of the complex electric susceptibility, χ′′(ω) is\nrelated with the dipole polarization loss, and ρis the dielectric\nresistivity in ·m.\nχ′′(ω) =(εs −ε∞) ωτ\n1 +(ωτ)2\nχ′(ω) =ε∞−1 +(εs −ε∞)/[1 +(ωτ)2] (4)\nwhere εs is the dielectric relative permittivity, ε∞ is the\ndielectric high-frequency relative permittivity, τ is the time\nconstant of polarization in s.\nAccording to (3) and (4), tan δhas a great relationship with\nthe dipole polarization phenomenon. The loss produced by\ndipole polarization varies with frequency, whose process is\ndifﬁcult to characterize in the ﬁnite element electric ﬁeld\nsimulation. Therefore, it is necessary to select the frequency\nsection of FDS that can neglect the impact of dipole polariza-\ntion loss on tan δ.\nWhen applied the voltage is at low frequency, ωis close\nto 0, and the tan δcan be rewritten as follows.\ntan δ=1/ωε0εsρ (5)\nAt low frequency of voltage, the electric ﬁeld changes\nslowly. Because the built-up time of dipole polarization is\napproximately 10 −6 ∼10−2 s, the dipole polarization has\nenough time to establish. The period of dipole rotation does\nnot lag behind the period of electric ﬁeld change. There-\nfore, the energy produced by the dipole polarization can be\nVOLUME 7, 2019 44051\nJ. Ruanet al.: Inversion of Oil-Immersed Paper Resistivity in Transformer Based on Dielectric Loss Factor\nneglected, namely, χ′′(ω) ≈0. The loss of conductance is\nthe main loss [17]. In summary, the tan δis closely related to\nits resistivity at low frequencies.\nFIGURE 2. Equivalent model of oil-paper insulation. (a) XY model.\n(b) Equivalent circuit.\nThe oil-paper insulation system, as a compound material,\ncan be equivalent to an XY model [29]. The equivalent model\nis shown in Figure 2. Spacers, oil, and paperboard resistivity\nand relative permittivity are ρ1, ε1,ρ2, ε2 and ρ3, ε3 respec-\ntively, Spacers, oil, and paperboard resistance and capaci-\ntance are R1, C1, R2, C2 and R3, C3 respectively, X is the\nratio of paperboard thickness to the total thickness of the main\ninsulation between high- and low-voltage windings. Y is the\nratio of the spacer width to the average circumference of the\nmain insulation between the high- and low-voltage windings.\nGenerally, X ∈[0.2,0.5],Y ∈[0.15,0.25] [29]. The total\ntanδcan be derived in Figure 2 as:\ntan δmix\n=(C1 tan δ1 +C2 tan δ2)/(C1 +C2) (6)\ntan δ\n=C3 tan δmix (1+tan2 δ3)+(C1 +C2) tan δ3(1+tan2 δmix )\n(C1 +C2)(1+tan2 δmix )+C3(1+tan2 δ3)\n(7)\nwhere tan δ1, tan δ2 and tan δ3 is the dielectric loss factors of\nspacers, oil, and paperboard, respectively; tan δmix is the total\ndielectric loss factor of spacers and oil.\nIn (7), only tan δ1, tan δ2 and tan δ3 are related to ω; other\nitems do not contain ω. According to (5), the tan δof the XY\nmodel can also neglect the effect of dipole polarization loss\nin each single dielectric at low frequency.\n\n\n\ntan δ1 =1/ωε0ε1ρ1\ntan δ2 =1/ωε0ε2ρ2\ntan δ3 =1/ωε0ε3ρ3\n(8)\n\n\n\nC1 =ε0ε1YA/(1 −X)\nC2 =ε0ε2(1 −Y )A/(1 −X)\nC3 =ε0ε2A/X\n(9)\nwhere A is the width of the medium.\nThe dielectric response of the XY model affected by\nthe paper dielectric parameter ( ρ and ε) at low frequency\nFIGURE 3. FDS under different paper dielectric parameters.\nis discussed as follows. In the ageing process, the ρ of\npaper decreases with ageing, while the ε increases with\nageing [26], [30]. Generally, the resistivity of paperboard and\ntransformer oil ranges on the order of 10 14·m and 1012·m,\nrespectively. Considering the inﬂuence of change range in\npaper resistivity and the relative permittivity on the FDS,\nthe FDS of different paper dielectric parameters is calcu-\nlated through (7), (8), and (9) as shown in Fig. 3, where\nX =0.5, Y =0.2, ρ1 =1 ×1012 ·m, ε2 =2.2, and\nε0 =8.85×10−12 F/m. Because the spacers and paperboard\nare the same material, so ρ1 = ρ3, ε1 = ε3. Accord-\ning to [26] and [30], the ρ1 ranges from 1 ×1014 ·m to\n5×1012 ·m, and ε1 ranges from 4.5 to 10.\nAs shown in Fig. 3, when the ρ of paper decreases from\n1×1014 ·m to 5×1012 ·m, the low-frequency curve moves\nupward, whereas the low-frequency section of the curve\ndid not change remarkably when the εof paper increases\nfrom 4.5 to 10.\nWhen the external voltage excitation is at low frequency,\nthe electric ﬁeld distribution is proportional to the resistiv-\nity. The relative permittivity of the paper is approximately\n2 times than that of the transformer oil, while its resis-\ntivity is 10 1 ∼102 times than that of the transformer oil.\nOverall, in the low-frequency electric ﬁeld, the oil-immersed\npaper undertakes the main voltage drop, so the low-frequency\nsection of FDS mainly reﬂects the change of oil-immersed\npaper resistivity. The above conclusion is similar to the\nexperimental results in [31]. In [31], the inﬂuence of different\nwater content on the FDS of oil-immersed paper was studied\nunder the same ageing state. The increase of moisture content\nwill lead to the decrease of resistivity, which indirectly shows\nthat tanδat the low frequency mainly embodies the change of\noil-immersed paper resistivity.\nIn short, the tan δ values at the low frequency of the oil-\npaper insulation are inﬂuenced greatly by the change of the\noil-immersed paper resistivity; meanwhile, the dipole polar-\nization loss of each layer has little inﬂuence on the tan δ at\nlow frequency. Therefore, the low-frequency tan δcan be used\nas the inversion input to calculate the oil-immersed paper\nresistivity. The inversion frequency is set to 10 −3 Hz in this\npaper.\n44052 VOLUME 7, 2019\nJ. Ruanet al.: Inversion of Oil-Immersed Paper Resistivity in Transformer Based on Dielectric Loss Factor\nIII. INVERSION ALGORITHM\nA. INVERSION MODEL\nAccording to the analysis of Section II, when the applied\nvoltage is at low frequency, a mapping relationship F is estab-\nlished through ﬁnite element time harmonic ﬁeld simulation\nas follows.\nF(ρ,ε,ρ oil ,εoil ) =tan δ (10)\nwhere ρ and ε are the average resistivity and relative per-\nmittivity of oil-immersed paper. ρoil and εoil are the average\nresistivity and relative permittivity of the transformer oil. The\nρoil and εoil can be measured through sampling, which are\nset as known. According to Figure 3, the change of relative\npermittivity of oil-immersed paper has little impact on tan δ\nat low frequency compared with resistivity. Therefore, this\npaper neglects the effect of ε, which is set as 4.5 in this paper.\nEquation (10) is written into (11).\nF(ρ) =tan δ (11)\nBecause of the complexity of the insulation structure in\ntransformer, F cannot be obtained from analytic formula.\nTo obtain the relationship F in (11), this paper built a\ntwo-dimensional (2D) ﬁnite element axisymmetric model as\nshown in Fig. 4.\nFIGURE 4. (a) 2-D axisymmetric finite element model and (b) local mesh\ngrid of transformer.\nIn Fig. 4(a), the oil-immersed paper is wrapped outside\nthe high- and low-voltage winding, and the insulation paper-\nboards are set between the high- and low-voltage winding,\nthe low-voltage winding and the iron core, and the high-\nvoltage winding and the transformer shell. They are all\nimmersed in transformer oil. Because the spacers are parallel\nwith the oil duct, and the resistance of the oil is much lower\nthan that of the spacers. Therefore, this paper neglected the\nspacer effect.\nIn the process of ﬁnite element time harmonic ﬁeld sim-\nulation, Solid 231 element is used, and triangular mesh is\nselected for meshing. The mesh grid is shown in Fig. 4(b).\nB. NEWTON-RAPHSON METHOD\nAn iterative method can solve nonlinear equations [27], [32]\nwith fast convergence speed and is suitable for high-\ndimensional complex computations. The Newton-Raphson\nmethod is the most widely used iterative method, which\nadopts a linear equation instead of nonlinear equations to\nestablish an iterative format. Therefore, the Newton-Raphson\nmethod is used to solve the oil-immersed paper resistivity ρ\nin (11) inversely.\n1) MULTI-REGIONAL RESISTIVITY INVERSION METHOD\nIn practical engineering, the deterioration of the oil-paper\ninsulation occurs in the local areas due to electro-thermal\nageing. Therefore, to consider the spatial dispersion of insula-\ntion ageing and roughly distinguish the weak areas of ageing,\nit is necessary to obtain the paper or paperboard resistivity in\ndifferent regions.\nThe mathematical model for inversion of resistivity in\ndifferent regions is to solve nonlinear equations. Multiple-\nsolutions are the main problem conducting inversion [18].\nIn order to guarantee the uniqueness of the solution, it is\nnecessary to guarantee the positive deﬁniteness of equations\nand the independence between the equations. Hence, dif-\nferent voltage loadings are used to increase the mapping\nrelationships. The oil-immersed paper inside the transformer\nis divided into N regions. The equations can be expressed\nas (12).\n\n\n\nF1(ρ1,ρ2,...ρ N ) =tan δ1\nF2(ρ1,ρ2,...ρ N ) =tan δ2\n...\nFN (ρ1,ρ2,...ρ N ) =tan δN\n(12)\nwhere the mapping relationships F1, F2,... FN indicate the\nmapping relationships caused by different voltage loadings,\nand ρ1,ρ2,...ρ N represent oil-immersed paper in N different\nregions. tan δ1, tan δ2, . . . tan δN represent the corresponding\nport dielectric loss factor under N voltage loadings.\nThe Newton-Raphson method is used to solve the nonlin-\near equations as follows:.\n(1) Set the initial resistivity value in N regions as\nρ10,ρ20,···ρN0;\n(2) Calculate the tan δs under different voltage loadings\ncorresponding to the initial resistivity through the ﬁnite ele-\nment time harmonic ﬁeld simulation, that is, tan δ10(ρ10, ρ20,\n. . .ρN0), tanδ20 (ρ10, ρ20,. . .ρN0),. . . tanδN0 (ρ10, ρ20,. . .ρN0);\nVOLUME 7, 2019 44053\nJ.

If all\nerrors are less than σstop, the iteration terminates. In addition,\nthe resistivity in various regions in the previous step is the\nactual resistivity. Otherwise, step (4) is executed.\n(4) Calculate the partial derivatives of tan δ10, tan δ20,\n···tanδN0 to ρ1, ρ2,··· ρN to form a Jacoby matrix.

Repeat\nstep (2) to step (6) until σ1, σ2, ···σN are less than σstop, and\nthe iteration stops.\nThe iterative ﬂow chart is as shown in Fig. 5. According to\nthe measurement rules of transformer tan δ, there are 3 dif-\nferent voltage loadings to measure 3 sets of tan δ, namely,\nN =3. The modes of voltage loading are shown in Table 1.\nFIGURE 5. Multi-dimensional iterative process.\nTABLE 1. Voltage loading modes and corresponding tanδ.\nIn Table 1, tan δH−L =tanδL−H, and ‘‘H’’, ‘‘L’’, and ‘‘S’’\nrepresent ‘‘high voltage windings’’, ‘‘low voltage windings’’,\nand ‘‘iron core and shell’’, respectively.\nTo calculate tanδat low frequency in the ﬁnite element time\nharmonic ﬁeld simulation, this paper takes the calculation of\ntanδH−L as an example. First, set the dielectric parameters of\nthe oil and paper, and set frequency f =10−3 Hz.

Ruanet al.: Inversion of Oil-Immersed Paper Resistivity in Transformer Based on Dielectric Loss Factor\nBecause the distribution of the electric ﬁeld in the trans-\nformer is different under 3 voltage loadings, the equations in\n(16) are independent of each other.\nFIGURE 6. Division of insulating paper.\nTABLE 2. Actual resistivity.\nTo demonstrate the validity of the inversion method,\nthe tanδvalues obtained by the simulation are set to the actual\nvalue to analog the tan δ obtained by the test. The oil-paper\ninsulation in Fig. 4 is divided into 3 regions as shown in Fig. 6.\nThis paper sets the actual resistivity of the 3 different regions\nas ρ1 =1×1013, ρ2 =0.5×1013, and ρ3 =1×1012·m to rep-\nresent 3 insulation state types of oil-immersed paper, where\nρ3 indicates ageing in this region. Meanwhile, the tan δH−LS,\ntanδL−HS, tanδHL−S under 3 types of voltage loadings corre-\nsponding to ρ1, ρ2, and ρ3 are calculated through ﬁnite ele-\nment simulation as 3.9156, 1.5284, and 3.2178, respectively.\nThese 3 tanδvalues are input into the inversion algorithm. The\nother parameter settings of the inversion are shown in Table 2.\nThe Newton-Raphson method is used for iteration. The\niterative data are shown in Table 3, where ϕ1, ϕ2, and ϕ3\nare relative errors between the inverse value and the actual\nvalue of resistivity. Fig. 7(a) is the iterative process under\nan initial resistivity value of 0.6 ×1012·m. Through the\ninversion calculation with 6 iterative steps, it can be seen\nthat the resistivity of the 3 regions converged to 1 ×1013·m,\n5×1012·m, and 1 ×1012·m successfully, which shows the\nvalidity of the algorithm. To compare the effects of different\ninitial values on the inversion algorithm, the initial resistivity\nvalue in the 3 regions is set as 1 ×1012·m, 5×1012·m, and\n1×1016·m. The other parameters remain unchanged, and\nthe iterative results are shown in Fig. 7(b)-(d).\nFrom Fig. 7(a)-(b), it can be seen that the iteration results\nwill not be modiﬁed by the upper and lower bounds. By con-\ntrast, when the initial value is 5 ×1012 ·m, as shown\nin Fig. 7(c), ρ3 has been modiﬁed once. For 1 ×1016·m,\nas shown in Fig. 7(d) ρ1has been modiﬁed twice, and ρ2,\nρ3 have been modiﬁed once. It can be predicted that if the\nresistivity constraints are not set, the iteration results will\nFIGURE 7. The iterative process with different initial resistivity.

Cause analysis of iterative divergence of Newton-Raphson\nmethod.\ndiverge so that the resistivity cannot be inverted. The Newton-\nRaphson method is sensitive to the selection of initial values,\nand the results will be divergent because the initial resistivity\nvalue is selected improperly. Mathematically, the fundamen-\ntal reason for this problem is that the second derivative of\nfunction F(x) has 0 points in the iteration interval, that is,\n∃x ∈[a, b], F\n′′\n(x) =0. In this paper, the one-dimensional\nnonlinear equation F(x) =tanδis used to explain this prob-\nlem. Suppose the true root x =x0. The intersection ( x =x2)\nof the tangent line of curve F(x) at x =x1 and the horizontal\nline y =tanδ is the next value of the iteration. By analogy,\nthe iteration sequence of x, { x1, x2, x3, x4. . . } is obtained.\nFrom Fig. 8, it can be seen that the direction of concave\nand convex of curve F(x) has changed in [ a, b], namely,\nthe second derivative of F(x) has 0 point, resulting in ‘‘over-\ncorrection’’ in each iteration; the value obtained is farther and\nfarther from the actual value x =x0, which leads the result to\ndiverge.\nIn general, to ensure that the roots of nonlinear equations\nconverge effectively, the initial value should be selected near\nthe root. For some practical problems, initial values can\nVOLUME 7, 2019 44055\nJ. Ruanet al.: Inversion of Oil-Immersed Paper Resistivity in Transformer Based on Dielectric Loss Factor\nTABLE 3.

Comparison between actual and simulated insulation state\npartitions.\nbe selected by experimental and engineering experience to\nensure effective convergence.\n2) ‘‘AVERAGE EFFECT’’ IN INVERSION\nIn fact, the ageing locations of oil-paper insulation in a\ntransformer are more random. It is difﬁcult for technicians to\nobtain the speciﬁc ageing parts directly from the outside, so it\nis difﬁcult to accurately divide the ageing area. Therefore,\nin this paper, the ‘‘average effect’’ of resistivity is added to\nthe inversion process.\nTo distinguish the partitions in Fig. 6, paper wrapping the\noutermost high voltage windings and paperboard (red region)\nare ageing in Fig. 9, whose resistivity is lower than that of\nthe other regions. The partition in Fig. 9 is thus regarded as\nthe actual insulation partition. However, the inversion sim-\nulation is still based on the partition of Fig. 6. The actual\nvalue of the resistivity in the 3 regions is still set as ρ1 =\n1×1013, ρ2 =0.5×1013, and ρ3 =1×1012·m in order.\nMeanwhile, the tan δH−LS, tan δL−HS, and tan δHL−S under\n3 types of voltage loadings corresponding to ρ1, ρ2, and ρ3\nare calculated through ﬁnite element simulation as 3.8981,\n1.5240, and 3.2023, respectively, which are regarded as actual\nvalues. The initial resistivity value is 0.6 ×1012·m. The\niteration results are shown in Table 4.\nIt can be seen that ρ3 in Table 4 is larger than that in Table 3,\nand ϕ3 increases from 0.0303% to 2.111%. This is because\nregion 3 in Fig. 9 is smaller than that of Fig. 6, which makes\nthe inversion calculation synthetically consider the resistivity\nof region 2 and 3 in Fig. 6, that is, the ‘‘average effect’’. There-\nfore, the inversed value is the ‘‘average’’ value. In conclusion,\nthe more similar the division in simulation is to the actual\ndivision, the closer the resistivity obtained by inversion is to\nthe actual value. In contrast, if the division in simulation is\ndifferent from the actual division, the ‘‘average effect’’ can\nreﬂect the ageing state of a certain region to a certain extent,\nwhich also shows that tan δat low frequency can effectively\nrespond to resistivity changes as an inversion input.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, the feasibility of a multi-region inversion\nmethod for oil-immersed paper insulation is studied.\n(1) The tan δ at low frequency and oil resistivity are used\nas inputs of inversion. Meanwhile, the resistivity of the oil-\nimmersed paper is used as the ageing characteristic, that is,\nthe inversion output.\n(2) Through the ﬁnite element time harmonic ﬁeld simu-\nlation, the nonlinear mapping relationship between the resis-\ntivity of oil-immersed paper and the tan δof the transformer\nis established. For considering the spatial dispersion of the\ninsulation ageing position in the transformer, the multi-\ndimensional iteration is realized by the Newton-Raphson\nmethod. The simulation results show that the relative errors of\nresistivity are less than 0.1%, which veriﬁes the correctness\nof the algorithm. However, if the initial value is not selected\nproperly, it will lead to divergence of inversion results.\n(3) Because the technicians may not be able to obtain\naccurate internal ageing locations directly from the outside of\na transformer, this method takes into account the inaccurate\ndivision of the ageing region during the inversion process.\nThe results show that the inaccuracy of division in the ageing\n44056 VOLUME 7, 2019\nJ. Ruanet al.: Inversion of Oil-Immersed Paper Resistivity in Transformer Based on Dielectric Loss Factor\nregion will cause an error in resistivity of the inversion com-\npared with the actual resistivity. However, it can reﬂect the\nageing state of a certain region qualitatively.\nIn the future, it is necessary to combine the steady-state\ninsulation resistance in [27] and tan δ at low frequency to\ndivide more regions. Meanwhile, the effect of moisture on\nthe resistivity of paperboard should be studied by experiments\nand using correction coefﬁcients to correct the resistivity of\npaperboard sample under different moisture content to elimi-\nnate the inﬂuence of moisture on the resistivity. In the numer-\nical algorithm, further optimization is needed to make the\nsolution converge quickly and accurately. The most important\nthing is to accurately inverse the ageing state of oil-immersed\npaper in follow-up experiments, all of which need to be\nperfected through follow-up studies. The inversion method\nproposed in this paper provides a new idea in the ﬁeld of\ntransformer condition assessment.\nREFERENCES\n[1] W. H.
