A\nnumber of works on the improvement of microstructures, struc tures, and sensing properties of gas\nsensing materials have been done by researchers. Nanomater ials, such as nanoﬁbers, nanowires,\ncarbon nanotubes (CNTs), and nanoparticles, are the main focu s of this research. In a study by\nZhou\net al. (2017a,b) , the highly porous NiO nanodisks (NiO-NDs) and its synthesis, characterization,\nand sensing applications to alcohol were analyzed. In the refer ence ( Zhou et al., 2018 ), the\n1D hierarchical p-n heterostructured Mn 3O4/SnO4 hybrid materials (HMs) was synthesized by\nZhou et al., and the sensing results to acetone indicates the perfect gas sensing performance of\nhybrid materials.\nDue to CNTs fullerene structure and its large surface area, an d the excellent electrical,\nmechanical, and thermal properties they have, CNTs have been o ne of the most widely studied gas\nsensing materials in the past two decades ( Chen et al., 2001; Rana et al., 2017; Zaporotskova et al.,\n2017). Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and multi-walle d carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)\nare the two main types of CNTs. The microstructure of SWCNTs an d MWCNTs are somehow the\nsame, that is, they consist of a rolled-up single sheet of a lay er of graphene. However, MWCNTs are\nTang et al. Pd-Doped SWCNTs-Based Hydrogen Gas Sensor\ncomposed of concentric tubes of graphene ﬁtted inside each oth er\n(Pitroda et al., 2016; Beitollahi et al., 2018; Han et al., 201 9).\nIt is conﬁrmed that adsorption of electron withdrawing (e.g. ,\nNO2, O 2) or donating (like NH 3) molecules on SWCNTs will\ncause the charge transfer between the nanotubes and molecul es\n(Kong et al., 2001 ). Compared with other gas sensing materials,\nlike MOS, CNTs—especially single-walled carbon nanotubes—\nhave remarkable properties. For example, they have the highest\nYoung’s modulus, highest thermal conductivity, ballistic electron\ntransport, and a high aspect ratio structure. What’s more, CNT s\nare a more stable electrode material than other gas sensing\nmaterials due to its lower probability to be reduced or oxidiz ed\nduring a substantial range of potentials (\nRobertson, 2004). In the\nreference (Naje et al., 2016 ), the detection of NO 2 using SWCNTs\nand MWCNTs on porous silicon wafers was done by Naje et al.\nThe NO 2 gas sensing performance of SWCNTs and MWCNTs\nvary at temperatures ranging from 25 to 250 ◦C, and it shows\nthat equal sensitivity can be reached with a higher temperatu re\nFIGURE 1 | (a–c) The 2D structure of the planar gas sensor.

The trace level detection of NH 3 and NO 2 at room\ntemperature via randomly oriented SWCNTs, which is grown by\nPECVE technique at 650 ◦C, were realized by\nLone et al. (2018) .\nResults show the quick response and recovery characteristics of\nboth NH 3 and NO 2. Additionally, the gas sensing abilities of\nunloaded SWCNTs to N 2O4 (Dai et al., 1999 ), O 2 (Kong et al.,\n1998), CO2 (Yoon et al., 2018 ), and CH 4 (Poonia et al., 2015 ) are\nwidely discussed.\nHigh-voltage oil-paper insulated transformers play an\nessential role in power transmission, but during the long-\nterm operation, due to oxidation, pollution, and excessive\ninner temperature, the transformer insulation oil will be\ndegraded and decomposed, producing traces of characteristic\ngases dissolving in the oil.

Pd-Doped SWCNTs-Based Hydrogen Gas Sensor\nfault in the oil-immersed transformer ( International Standard\nIEC 60599: 2015, 2015 ). Gas sensing nanomaterials such as\nSnO2, ZnO, WO 3, and MoS 2, as well as their functionalized\nderivatives, have been applied in studies on characteristic\ngases detecting of high-voltage transformers (\nTang et al., 2017;\nZhou et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019; Wei et al., 2019 ). More\nimportantly, Zhang et al. found that CNTs are well-performed\ngas sensing materials for gas detection of high-voltage ele ctrical\nequipment (\nZhang et al., 2017 ). However, it was reported\nin the study Kong et al. (2001) that nanotubes show a poor\nsensing response to some gas molecules. Instead, geometrica l\noptimizations of SWCNTs with and without doped metals\nand their gas adsorption structures were studied based on\ncomputational methodology by applying restricted density\nfunctional theory (DFT) by\nTabtimsai et al. (2011) . Calculation\nand simulation indicated that decorating SWCNTs with\nPd nanoparticles can eﬀectively enhance the gas sensing\nperformance to NO 2, NH 3, H 2O, and H 2. The hydrogen\natoms dissociated from the hydrogen molecules have smaller\nadsorption energy and dissociation energy on the Pd cluster. As\nan electron donor, Pd clusters can quickly dissociate hydro gen\natoms, electron acceptors, and accelerate electron transfe r in\ngas-sensitive materials.\nIn this paper, the carboxylated and 3.07 wt% Pd-doped\nSWCNTs-based nanomaterials were synthesized based on the\nunloaded SWCNTs-based nanomaterials. Three SWCNTs-\nbased nanomaterials (the unloaded, the carboxylated,\nand the Pd-doped) were fabricated into corresponding\nplanar gas sensors. Gas sensing properties including the\ntemperature characteristics, the concentration character istics,\nthe linearity, detecting limitation, and the response and\nrecovery time characteristics of three SWCNTs-based gas\nsensors to hydrogen were studied. Gas sensing mechanisms\nwere analyzed. In the results, Pd-doped SWCNTs-base\ngas sensor presents the best gas sensing performance to\nhydrogen. This study can provide a novel solution to the\nissue of characteristic gases detection in high-voltage oi l-paper\ninsulated transformers.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nPreparation of SWCNTs-Based\nNanomaterials\nThe unloaded SWCNTs-based nanomaterials were made by\nTimesnano of Chengdu Organic Chemicals Co. Ltd., Chinese\nAcademy of Sciences. The outer Diameter (OD) of the\nunloaded SWCNTs-based gas sensing nanomaterials is 1–3 nm,\nand the purity is all higher than 90 wt%. The length of\nnanomaterials is about 50 microns. Concentrated hydrochlo ric\nacid, concentrated sulfuric acid, concentrated nitric aci d,\nisopropanol, and ammonia used in the preparation process\nwere purchased from Chongqing Chuandong Chemical Co., Ltd.\n(China), and all were of analytical grade. Palladium chlori de\n(PdCl2) provided a source of palladium. Deionized water was\nalso used.\nThe processes of preparation of SWCNTs-based\nnanomaterials are classiﬁed into three steps:\n(1) Puriﬁcation of the unloaded SWCNTs\nSix hundred milligram of unloaded SWCNTs were added\nto 300 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid and ultrasonica lly\ncleaned for 30 min. Five hundred milligram of deionized wate r\nwas used to ultrasonically clean the mixture for another\n30 min. The cleaned mixture was placed in a drying box\nand dried at 150 ◦C for 10 h.

Pd-Doped SWCNTs-Based Hydrogen Gas Sensor\nFIGURE 3 | The planar gas sensor.\nFour hundred milligram of puriﬁed unloaded SWCNTs\nwere added to 50 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid and 20 ml\nof concentrated nitric acid, and heated and stirred at 80 ◦C\nfor 4 h. After the mixture was cooled down, it was diluted\nwith 60 ml deionized water. The mixture was ﬁltered through\na microporous membrane with a pore diameter of 0.45\nmicrons, and washed repeatedly with deionized water until\npH = 7. After drying at 80 ◦C for 12 h, acidiﬁed SWCNTs\nwere obtained.\n(3) Functionalization of the acidiﬁed SWCNTs\nTwo hundred milligram of SWCNT was dissolved in 50 ml\nof isopropanol and sonicated for 20 min to improve the\ndispersibility of SWCNTs. 10.31 mg of PdCl 2 was dissolved\nin 3 ml of ammonia water. PdCl 2 solution was added to the\nSWCNTs/isopropanol mixed solution drop by drop, and stirred\nat a high speed for 2 h. The obtained suspension was put in\na drying box and dried at 80 ◦C for 2 h. The obtained powder\nwas put in a calciner at 600 ◦C for 2 h. 3.07 wt% Pd-doped\nSWCNTs-based nanomaterials were synthesized successfully .\nThe microstructure of the nanomaterials was characterized\nby Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) (SU8020, HITACHI,\nJapan) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) (JEM-\n2000EX, JEOL, Japan).\nFabricated of SWCNTs-Based Gas Sensors\nPlanar gas sensors are applied in this paper. The structure of\nplanar gas sensors is shown in Figure 1. The planar gas sensor is\nmainly composed of a Pt heating electrode, a Si base layer, an A u\ngas sensing electrode, and a SWCNTS-based sensing ﬁlm layer.\nThe size of the testing area is 300 µ m × 300 µ m. The hardware\nstructure of the gas sensor is fabricated by Zhengzhou Winse n\nElectronics Technology CO., Ltd by processes mainly includi ng\noxidation, photolithography, sputtering, stripping, depositio n,\nand etching, which are presented in Figure 2.\nThe planar sensor array is shown in Figure 3. The n-type\n(110) crystal face double polished silicon wafer (thickness is about\n300 µ m, and conductivity is 0.001–0.1 S/m) is used. In this paper,\nthree SWCNTs-based sensing nanomaterials are coated by the\ndroplet guiding method. After fully grinding the appropriate\nnumber of SWCNTs-based nanomaterials, it was dissolved in\nabsolute ethanol for 1 h to obtain the corresponding dispersion ,\nwhich was then dried at 400 ◦C to get ultraﬁne powder. The\ndeionized water droplets were applied to the sensor unit testing\narea using a micro syringe, and the SWCNTs-based nanomateri al\npowder was carefully applied to the droplets. After drying for 8 h,\nthe powder was closely attached to the testing area, and three\nSWCNTs-based planar gas sensors were fabricated successfull y.\nGas Sensing Test Methods\nThe experimental platform consists of air source, RSC2000-\nA automatic gas mixing system (Beijing JS Co.), and CGS-8\nintelligent gas sensitivity analysis system (Beijing Elit e Tech\nCo., China), which is presented in Figure 4. The detection of\nthe electrical signals of the gas sensor is mainly realized by\nthe classical resistor divider principle, and the test circui t is\nshown in Figure 5, where RL is the adjustable load resistance\nand RS is the resistance at both ends of the test electrode.\nRH is the resistance of the heating electrode of the sensing\nunit. VH and VS is the heating voltage and test voltage,\nrespectively. During the test, RS will vary with the change\nof condition and can be calculated by the principle of\nvoltage division.\nThe sensor response values deﬁned here are as follows (\nWang\net al., 2010 ):\nRs = (Rgas − Rair)/ Rair\nSpeciﬁc steps are as follows:\n1. The gas sensor is placed in a closed air chamber ﬁlled with pure\nair (20 L), and the sensing signal ( Rs) is recorded by CGS-8\nsystem during the test.\n2. The determined concentrations of hydrogen are injected b y\nRSC2000-A system (gas ﬂow: 250 sccm). The resistance value\nis recorded after the signal is stable.\n3. The air chamber is opened through the fume hood and the\nresistance made to return to the initial value Rair.\n4. Step (2) and step (3) are repeated.\n5. The recorded data is saved and further experiments can be\nproceeded with.\nExperiments were all carried out at a temperature of 28 ◦C and at\n60% humidity.\nFrontiers in Chemistry | www.frontiersin.org 4 April 2020 | Volume 8 | Article 174\nTang et al.

From the SEM images,\nthe three kinds of SWCNTs are all intertwined and woven into a\nmesh, and the morphology of the SWCNTs after functioning has\nnot changed much. However, in Figures 6b,c, the carboxylated\nand the Pd-doped SWCNTs are shorter in length and more\ndistributed compared to the unloaded SWCNTs in Figure 6a. In\nthe TEM images, all three SWCNTs are curved and tubular, and\nthe basic structure has not been functionally damaged.\nAfter acidiﬁcation treatment, SWCNTs were oxidized under\nthe action of concentrated sulfuric acid and concentrated n itric\nacid. Oxygen atoms released by concentrated nitric acid att acked\ncarbon nanotubes, especially the defects at the ends and on th e\ntube walls. Because carbon atoms are not stable six-membere d\nrings in SWCNTs and are in a metastable state, SWCNTs\nwill break in places where the nanotube curvature is large.\nThus, the length of nanotubes becomes shorter, and nanotube s\ngradually disperse.\nGas Sensing Properties\nThe temperature characteristics, concentration character istics\n(including linearity and detecting limitation), response a nd\nrecovery time characteristics of the unloaded, the carboxy lated,\nand the Pd-doped SWCNTs- based gas sensors were studied in\nthe hydrogen atmosphere.\nIn Figure 7, the temperature characteristics of three SWCNTs-\nbased gas sensors are illustrated among 150–400 ◦C to 100 µ L/L\nhdrogen. On the one hand, three diﬀerent SWCNTs-based gas\nsensors present the same trend of temperature characteristic s:\ncurves climb at ﬁrst with the increase of the temperature and\ndecrease after reaching the optimal operating temperature. Th is\nmight be because when heated to a certain temperature, the\nsurface of SWCNTs nanomaterials is occupied by oxygen atoms\nreleased from the air, which increases the surface conducta nce of\nthe materials and, thus, shows a decrease in resistance. On th e\nother hand, after modifying SWCNTs-based nanomaterials wi th\nPd nanoparticles, the optimal operating temperature dropped\nsharply by 125 ◦C, and the peak response of Pd-doped SWCNTs-\nbased gas sensor is 10.1 and 3.2 times higher than that of the\nunloaded and carboxylated SWCNTs-based gas sensors under the\nrespective optimal operating temperature, respectively.\nConcentration characteristics were tested in 0–500 µ L/L\nhydrogen at 275 ◦C, as shown in Figure 8.

The response time\nand recovery time of Pd-doped SWCNTs-based gas sensor are\nabout 100 and 150 s. What’s more, the gas sensing response\nvalue of the three gas sensors is slightly increased after th e third\ntime test, which might be because of the incomplete exhaust\neach time, resulting in the presence of more hydrogen than\nexpected in the ﬁnal gas chamber. The recovery process of\ngas sensing materials is a dynamic process of adsorption and\ndesorption between the molecules of the test gas, hydrogen, a nd\nnanotubes. If the hydrogen molecules in the gas chamber are\nnot exhausted cleanly, a small amount of hydrogen molecules\nwill still be adsorbed with the active sites on the surface of the\nnanotube at high temperatures, shown as the hydrogen atoms,\nso that there will still be less electron exchange in the gas s ensing\nmaterial nanotubes.\nGas Sensing Mechanism\nObviously, after decorating SWCNTs with Pd nanoparticles, th e\ngas sensing performance to hydrogen was remarkably enhanced .\nThis is attributed to the enhanced electrical property toward\nmolecular hydrogen compared with the undecorated SWCNTs.\nThe gas sensing reaction is the interactions between H 2, Pd,\nand the nanotubes. After heating, hydrogen molecules disso ciate\nfaster into atomic hydrogen on Pd surface, resulting in the\ndissolution of atomic hydrogen in Pd with high solubility,\nconsequently decreasing the work function of Pd, that is sho wn in\nthe formula (1). The lowering of the work function of Pd leads to\nfaster and easier electron transfer from Pd to SWCNTs, reduc ing\nthe number of hole-carries in the p-type nanotubes and the valu e\nof conductance.\nWhen the Pd-doped SWCNTs-based gas sensor was in a low\nhydrogen atmosphere, the reason why it can reverse and auto\nrecover is because of the oxygen in the air and on the surfaces ,\nwhich is represented as the formulas (2) and (3) (\nMandelis et al.,\n1993; Collins, 2000; Kong, 2000 ).\nH2 → 2Hatom on surfacesHatom on surfaces → Hatom in Pd (1)\nO2 + 2Hatom on surfaces → 2OH (2)\nOH + Hatom on surfaces → H2O (3)\nCONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we prepared the carboxylated and 3.07 wt% Pd-\ndoped SWCNTs-based nanomaterials based on the unloaded\nSWCNTs, and three diﬀerent SWCNTs-based planar gas sensors\nwere fabricated and tested in hydrogen to study their gas sen sing\nproperties. Results show that functionalized SWCNTs-based\ngas sensor with Pd nanoparticles present the best gas sensing\nperformance, and has the lowest optimal operating temperature\n(225◦C) and the highest gas sensing response to 500 µ L/L\nhydrogen at 275 ◦C ( Rs ∼\n= 33.79). The gas response and recovery\ntime of Pd-doped SWCNTs-based gas sensor are both 50 s shorter\nthan those of the unloaded and carboxylated SWCNTs-based ga s\nsensors. This was because the Pd doping lowers the work functi on\nand enhances the electrical property toward molecular hydrog en.\nResults could assist the development of novel SWCNTs-based ga s\nsensors for fault characteristic gases detection in the hig h-voltage\nelectrical transformers.\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\nThe datasets generated for this study are available on reque st to\nthe corresponding author.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nST designed the experiment, ﬁnished the experiment, data\ncollected and analyzed, and wrote the paper.
