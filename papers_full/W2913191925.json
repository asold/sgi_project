By contrast, the ability of ERP\nresearch to contribute to the emerging ﬁeld of the neurobiolo gy of language has proved more\ncontroversial (\nSmall, 2008; Small et al., 2011 ). The neurobiology of language is a subﬁeld of human\nneuroscience, with an explicit focus on the neural mechanism s underlying language ( Small et al.,\n2011). Language-related ERPs, however, are often endowed with fu nctional interpretations that are\nstrongly linguistic or cognitive in nature, thus considera bly limiting the scope of conclusions that\ncan be drawn about neural mechanisms. Perhaps the clearest ex ample of this is the long-standing\ndebate about whether diﬀerent linguistic subdomains (e.g., syntax, semantics) are associated with\ndissociable ERP components (e.g., LAN, P600 vs. N400) (For acc ounts in favor of this perspective,\nsee for example Osterhout and Nicol, 1999; Friederici, 2002; Hagoort, 2005 ; for arguments\nBornkessel-Schlesewsky and Schlesewsky Neurobiology of the N400\nagainst, e.g., Sassenhagen et al., 2014; Bornkessel-Schlesewsky\net al., 2016 ). More general accounts are typically cognitive in\nnature, positing functions such as access to semantic memory\nfor the N400 (\nKutas and Federmeier, 2000, 2011 ) or conﬂict\nmonitoring for the P600 ( Kolk et al., 2003; van de Meerendonk\net al., 2009 ), to name just two examples. While functional\ninterpretations of this type are suited to informing linguist ic or\ncognitive theories, the gap to neural mechanisms and, hence , the\nneurobiology of language is readily apparent.\nConversely, more general developments in cognitive\nneuroscience suggest that ERP-based research can indeed\ninform theory-building in a deeply neurobiological manner.\nThe mismatch negativity (MMN) is a case in point, having\nfeatured prominently in studies on predictive coding and free\nenergy minimization in the brain (e.g.,\nFriston, 2005; Garrido\net al., 2009; Moran et al., 2014 ). In addition to providing a\npossible uniﬁed theory of neural information processing acro ss\na wide range of diﬀerent domains (for review, see Friston, 2010),\npredictive coding has been linked intimately to neurobiolog y\nvia assumptions about cortical organization down to the leve l of\ncortical microcircuits ( Bastos et al., 2012 ).\nOutline of the Hypothesis and Theory to be\nPut Forward Here\nHere, we propose that the insights gained in the context of\nthe MMN and predictive coding can be fruitfully applied to\nunderstanding both the functional role and the neurobiolog y of\nthe N400, as well as that of other language-related negative ERP\ncomponents (e.g., the LAN). Speciﬁcally, we argue that N400\namplitude reﬂects precision-weighted prediction error signa ls,\nwith high precision essentially amounting to conditions of l ow\nuncertainty regarding the role of a particular information s ource\n(see below for a more detailed exposition). The antecendent\nconditions of N400 eﬀects are thus very similar to those of\nthe MMN, and we therefore posit that the two components\nshow shared characteristics as part of a functionally and\nneurobiologically related family of negative ERP components .\nLatency and topography diﬀerences between diﬀerent members\nof the family can be attributed to the nature and complexity of\nthe information being processed (e.g., single tones vs. conne cted\nspeech in context).\nOn the basis of the hypothesized familial similarity between\nthe N400 and the MMN, we put forward a new theory on\nthe neurobiology of the N400. This proposal draws on the\nextensive literature linking the MMN to predictive coding\nand the empirical and theoretical progress that has been\nmade on the neurobiological grounding of predictive coding\narchitectures. We further suggest that this general framew ork\nalso applies to other language-related negativities and that\nit contrasts with the functional role—and neurobiology—of\nlanguage-related positivities.\nOverview\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows. We\nbegin by brieﬂy reviewing the—much discussed and somewhat\ncontroversial—status of prediction in language comprehensi on,\nfocusing speciﬁcally on the role that the N400 literature has\nplayed in informing this debate. Subsequently, we introduce\nthe predictive coding framework, arguing that its application i n\nthe context of the N400-prediction debate has three advantag es:\n(a) it renders a number of controversies on prediction\nand the N400 moot by showing how apparently competing\nperspectives can be integrated within a single architecture;\n(b) it allows for architectural and mechanistic assumptions\nabout language processing to be derived within a more general\nframework for information processing in the human brain; (c)\nits neurobiological bases have been studied extensively. W e\nthen go on to describe in more detail how the cognitive and\nneurobiological assumptions of predictive coding have been\napplied in the context of a model component, the MMN, before\nmotivating how they can be extended to negative language-\nrelated ERP components such as the N400. Language-related\npositivities, by contrast, are posited to have distinct functio nal\nand neurobiological characteristics. The ﬁnal sections of the\npaper discuss the present account in relation to existing\ninterpretations of the N400 and other relevant ERP components,\nconcluding with an outlook and testable hypotheses.\nIt is important to note that this paper describes a new,\nneurobiologically grounded perspective on the N400 and other\nlanguage-related negativities as recorded using scalp EEG. Its\nprimary purpose is to describe this new account and the testable\nhypotheses arising from it, and it thus does not seek to provide an\nexhaustive review of the existing literature on the N400 or ot her\nlanguage-related ERP components.\nPREDICTION IN LANGUAGE AND THE\nN400: DISCUSSIONS AND\nCONTROVERSIES\nThe notion of prediction has played a prominent, but\ncontroversial role in the psycholinguistic and neurolinguist ic\nliterature. We will provide a short overview of this debate,\nfocusing speciﬁcally on the role that the N400 has played in thi s\ncontext (for more comprehensive reviews, see\nVan Petten and\nLuka, 2012; DeLong et al., 2014 )1.\nIn light of the well-established observation that N400\namplitude is inversely correlated with stimulus predictabili ty2\n(see Kutas and Federmeier, 2011 , for a review), the idea that the\nN400 reﬂects prediction appears highly plausible at a ﬁrst glance.\nHowever, ﬁndings of this type do not constitute conclusive\nevidence for prediction, as they are also compatible with varyin g\nintegration costs for the current input item vis à vis the cont ext\n(see\nVan Petten and Luka, 2012 , for detailed discussion).\n1For discussion of ERP components other than the N400 that have b een linked\nto prediction, see Van Petten and Luka (2012) and Nieuwland (2019) . These are\nbeyond the scope of the present paper.\n2Predictability is typically measured via the cloze task, in which an i ndependent\ngroup of participants is asked to provide a continuation for a sente nce (or text)\nfragment. For a more detailed discussion of cloze probability and the N 400, see\nKutas and Federmeier (2011) . Some recent approaches have also attempted to\nquantify predictability in terms of surprisal (a word’s negative log-probability),\nan information-theoretic measure indexing the amount of informatio n a word\nconveys (cf. Levy, 2008 ). See Frank et al. (2015) and Kuperberg (2016) , for\ndiscussion of N400 amplitude modulations in terms of surprisal.\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 2 February 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 298\nBornkessel-Schlesewsky and Schlesewsky Neurobiology of the N400\nAdditional discussion has focused on what is, in fact, meant\nby prediction. In this context, “active” prediction of a single\nupcoming word is often contrasted with “passive” anticipation\nof upcoming input, with the latter typically conceptualized in\nterms of the preactivation of particular stimulus features (c f.\nKutas and Federmeier, 2000; Van Petten and Luka, 2012; DeLon g\net al., 2014 ). Arguments in favor of preactivation—and against\nprediction “proper”—have been advanced on the basis of several\nproperties of the N400:\n• N400 amplitude reduction for a target word appears to\nbe feature-based rather than requiring full identity. This\nis evidenced by a range of studies that observed reduced\nN400 amplitudes for unexpected continuations sharing certain\nproperties with the expected continuation. In the ﬁrst study\nof this type,\nFedermeier and Kutas (1999) demonstrated\nthis for category overlap with the expected continuation\n(e.g., “‘Checkmate, ’ Rosaline announced with glee. She was\ngetting to be really good at chess/monopoly/football”). N40 0\namplitude was largest for the between-category violation\n(“football”), intermediate for the within-category viola tion\n(“monopoly”), and smallest for the expected continuation\n(“chess”). Related eﬀects have since been observed for\northographic similarity to the expected continuation (\nLaszlo\nand Federmeier, 2009 )3, similar sensorimotor properties\n(Amsel et al., 2015 ), and association with the event under\ndiscussion independent of associations with individual wor ds\nin the context ( Metusalem et al., 2012 ).\n• While there is widespread evidence for an N400 amplitude\nreduction for predictable words (or words related to\npredictable words), there is less support for N400\namplitude increases reﬂecting prediction mismatches.\nIn other words, the N400 appears to mirror facilitation\nrather than penalties or processing costs arising from\nfailed prediction.\nSeveral studies have attempted to circumvent the problems\narising from the attempt to measure prediction on a critical\nword—due to the general diﬃculty in separating prediction and\nintegration at this position as discussed above—by measurin g\nat a position preceding the critical word. The most prominent\nstudy of this type was conducted by\nDeLong et al. (2005) ,\nwho presented sentences such as “The day was breezy so the\nboy went outside to ﬂy a/an . . . ” and observed an N400 for\n“an” vs. “a.” Here, “a” but not “an” is compatible with the\nexpected continuation “kite, ” while both are equally congru ent\nto the preceding context. As this renders the N400 eﬀect at\nthe article diﬃcult to explain via integration, the ﬁndings b y\nDeLong et al. (2005) were long regarded as seminal evidence for\nprediction eﬀects in the N400. Moreover, the data suggest that\ncomprehenders not only predict word meanings, but that they\nalso preactivate associated form-based properties. More recen tly,\nhowever, a controversy has arisen regarding this result, as a\nlarge-scale ( N = 334) study failed to replicate\nDeLong et al.\n(2005)’s article N400 eﬀect ( Nieuwland et al., 2018 ). Nieuwland\n3Note, however, that there has been a discussion about the timin g of the\northographic relatedness eﬀect (see Ito et al., 2016; DeLong et al., 2018 ).\net al. (2018) thus conclude: “[o]ur results do not support the\nview that readers routinely pre-activate the phonological fo rm of\npredictable words” (p.1).\nHowever, a number of other studies in languages other than\nEnglish support the fact that prediction mismatches prior to\ncritical stimulus onset can give rise to N400 eﬀects.\nWicha\net al. (2004) observed an N400 at the position of a determiner\npreceding a critical noun in Spanish, when the gender of the\ndeterminer did not match that of the predicted noun.\nSzewczyk\nand Schriefers (2013) reported an N400 for prenominal adjectives\nin Polish, when they did not belong to the animacy category\nmatching that of the predicted noun. Finally, in a study on\nGerman sign language,\nHosemann et al. (2013) found N400\neﬀects time-locked to the handshape change preceding critical\nsign onset. Handshape change preceded sign onset by a mean\nof approximately 300 ms and was followed by a transition phase\nto the handshape for the target sign. Crucially, even though th e\ntransition phase in and of itself is not associated with a speciﬁ c\nsign and does not bear any meaning, N400 amplitudes increased\nwhen the transition phase was not compatible with the predicted\ntarget sign. This result thus provides strong coverging suppor t for\nprediction-based preactivation of form features prior to crit ical\nword onset.\nIn summary, we interpret the literature as having\ndemonstrated prediction eﬀects in the N400, but we also\nshare the perspective of\nDeLong et al. (2014) , who state that\n“[W]e feel obliged to point out that language processing is\nunlikely to proceed in either a strictly anticipatory (context\nexerting its inﬂuence prior to the receipt of target input) or\nstrictly integrative (context exerting its inﬂuence only f ollowing\nreceipt of target input) manner. In other words, under various\ncircumstances, sentence comprehension likely arises through\nsome combination of predictive and integrative mechanisms”\n(\nDeLong et al., 2014 , p. 632) (For similar suggestions, see e.g.,\nFedermeier, 2007; Lotze et al., 2011; Tune et al., 2014 ).\nENTER PREDICTIVE CODING\nRe-examining the debate on prediction in language and the\nN400 from the perspective of predictive coding has at least\nthree advantages. Firstly, it allows us to consider predictive\nprocessing in the context of a more general framework for\nhow the human brain processes information. This constitutes a\nparsimonious approach to prediction in language: unless there\nis compelling evidence to suggest otherwise, it is appealing\nto assume that language behaves similarly to other cognitiv e\ndomains in regard to prediction of upcoming information.\nSecondly, predictive coding provides a framework within whic h\nanticipatory (top-down) and integrative (bottom-up) processe s\nnaturally interact. In our view, it thus renders some of the d ebates\non prediction in language processing moot, by demonstrating\nhow both sides of an assumed dichotomy can co-exist within a\nsingle, independently motivated architecture (cf. the obser vation\nby\nDeLong et al., 2014 , in the preceding section). Thirdly,\nthe neurobiological underpinnings of a predictive coding\narchitecture have been examined extensively, thereby openi ng\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 3 February 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 298\nBornkessel-Schlesewsky and Schlesewsky Neurobiology of the N400\nup new possibilities for deepening our understanding of the\nneurobiology of language.\nThe ﬁrst of these two advantages will be covered in the\nfollowing subsection, which provides a brief introduction t o\npredictive coding. We subsequently discuss the neurobiolog ical\nassumptions underlying current predictive coding theories.\nA Necessary Interplay Between Top-Down\nand Bottom-Up Processes\nThe predictive coding framework is built on the basic assumpti on\nthat the brain actively constructs explanations for the caus es of\nits sensory inputs (e.g.,\nFriston, 2005, 2010 ). To achieve this, it\nmaintains an internal generative model of the world, which ma ps\n(hidden) causes to sensory consequences. These hypothesize d\nsensory consequences are constantly tested against actual sensory\ninput, with action serving to selectively sample sensations fo r\nthis purpose (cf. Friston et al., 2016 ). When there is a mismatch\nbetween the sensations generated by the internal model and t hose\nactually encountered, a prediction error ensues and the mode l is\nupdated. The system thereby aims to minimize prediction error\nby minimizing the perceptual divergence between the model\nhypotheses and the true posterior distribution of the sensory\ninput. Predictive coding and hypothesis testing is accomplishe d\nat multiple levels, from very precise, short timescales to muc h\nlonger timescales with higher abstraction and less sensory\nprecision (from percepts to concepts; see (\nHohwy, 2013 ), for\ndiscussion). Prediction errors are propagated up the cortica l\nhierarchy via feedforward connections, thus serving to upda te the\npredictive model at each level and determine priors for the nex t\nprediction. This amounts to a highly eﬃcient coding scheme, a s\nonly the divergence between expected and actual inputs needs t o\nbe conveyed rather than the input itself (e.g., Attneave, 1954; Rao\nand Ballard, 1999 ).\nImportantly, in this approach, sensory input and prediction\nerror are equivalent to the extent to which the sensory\ninput has not been predicted. Hence, the predictive coding\nliterature often refers to prediction errors being “explaine d\naway.” In the words of\nFriston (2010, p. 130): “explaining\naway just means countering excitatory bottom-up inputs to a\nprediction error neuron with inhibitory synaptic inputs that a re\ndriven by top-down predictions [. . . ]. The reciprocal exchange\nof bottom-up prediction errors and top-down predictions\nproceeds until prediction error is minimized at all levels\nand conditional expectations are optimized.” Thus, from the\nperspective of predictive coding, we should not necessarily\nexpect to observe a “special” (e.g., neurophysiological) erro r\nsignal for an unpredicted input, but rather an attenuation\nof the signal accompanying a sensory input when that\ninput is predicted. This observation, which will be discussed\nfurther in the context of the MMN below, neatly mirrors\nthe generalization that N400 amplitude diﬀerences appear to\nresult from an attenuation of the N400 for predicted stimuli\nrather than augmentation of the N400 for unpredicted stimuli .\nRecall from above that this has been used as an argument\nagainst prediction in the context of the N400. However, as\ndemonstrated by predictive coding, N400 attenuation is, in f act, a\nperfectly possible accompaniment to prediction when prediction\nerrors are equated with sensory signals that have not been\n“explained away.”\nNeurobiological Grounding\nIn addition to its detailed mechanistic assumptions about th e\ninterplay between top-down predictions and sensory input,\npredictive coding architectures have been underpinned with\ndetailed neurobiological design assumptions. At the macros copic\nlevel (extrinsic connectivity), the observation that cort ical areas\nare organized hierarchically (\nFelleman and Van Essen, 1991 )\nprovides an anatomical basis for the hierarchical organizat ion\nof the predictive model. Moreover, Bastos et al. (2012) put\nforward a detailed account of how characteristics of a predic tive\ncoding architecture correspond to the components and intrins ic\nconnectivity of canonical cortical microcircuits (for alt ernative\narchitectonic assumptions, see Heilbron and Chait, 2017 ).\nIn brief, feedforward prediction error signals from lower\ncortical areas are received in the granular layer (L4). They\nare passed on to excitatory and inhibitory interneurons in\nsupragranular (superﬁcial) layers, which are thought to enco de\nconditional expectations about hidden causes and states,\nrespectively. This information—essentially corresponding to\nthe updated model—is conveyed to pyramidal neurons in\ninfragranular (deep) layers, encoding new predictions that a re\ntransmitted via feedback connections to lower cortical are as (and\nback to L4).\nIn addition, supragranular pyramidal cells serve to transmit\nprediction errors to higher cortical areas. While the ascend ing\nprojections which serve to transmit prediction error signals up\nthe cortical hierarchy are excitatory and can drive spiking a ctivity\nin their target regions, the descending projections that con vey\npredictions to lower cortical areas are likely inhibitory and both\ndriving as well as modulating (\nBastos et al., 2012 ). Finally, based\non diﬀerent oscillatory properties of the activity in superﬁcial and\ndeep layers, it has been proposed that feedforward (prediction -\nerror-related) activity may be carried by higher frequenci es,\nwhile feedback (prediction-related) activity is conveyed b y lower\nfrequencies (Maier et al., 2010 ).\nFigure 1 provides an overview of the predictive coding\narchitecture and its neurobiological grounding.\nTHE MISMATCH NEGATIVITY (MMN) AS A\nMODEL COMPONENT\nThe cognitive and neurobiological assumptions in the previou s\nsection have been applied fruitfully in the context of the\nmismatch negativity (MMN, for a review, see\nGarrido et al.,\n2009), thus demonstrating the potential to investigate the\nneurobiology or predictive coding using scalp-recorded\nEEG. The MMN can be viewed as reﬂecting the prediction\nerror—and, hence, the need for a model update—that arises\nwhen an unpredicted auditory stimulus is encountered. By\ncontrast, the absence of MMN eﬀects during the repeated\npresentation of a standard stimulus results from the improved\npredictability of the upcoming sensory input. In this case,\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 4 February 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 298\nBornkessel-Schlesewsky and Schlesewsky Neurobiology of the N400\nFIGURE 1 | Schematic depiction of the predictive coding architecture .

(2012) .\nprediction error-related activity in lower cortical areas i s\nsuppressed via the predictive feedback connections from\nhigher areas; these serve to explain away the sensory input\nbased on the assumptions of the generative model. As the\nmodel’s ability to predict the input becomes more precise,\nless weight is assigned to bottom-up signals, thus reducing\nthe post-synaptic sensitivity (gain) of prediction error unit s\n(\nGarrido et al., 2009 ).\nBy emphasizing the importance of integrating top-down\npredictions with bottom-up input, the predictive coding accou nt\nof the MMN can explain a number of established ﬁndings,\nincluding that:\n• MMN amplitudes are proportional to the perceptual\ndivergence between the standard and deviant stimuli,\nreﬂecting the magnitude of the prediction error\n(\nSams et al., 1985 );\n• MMN eﬀects emerge via the reduction of ERP amplitudes\nfor standards across a train of repeated presentations,\nreﬂecting the continual reduction in post-synaptic sensitiv ity\nfor prediction error units with increasing predictive precisi on\n(\nBaldeweg et al., 2004 )\nIt thereby uniﬁes assumptions of previous competing accounts\nof the MMN based on model adaptation and adaptation to\nthe standard stimulus, respectively (see\nGarrido et al., 2009 , for\ndetailed discussion).\nThe predictive coding account of the MMN is supported\nby studies using dynamic causal modeling (DCM), with model\nparameters reﬂecting the adjustment of connectivity to bette r\nreﬂect the input drawing on plastic changes in synaptic\nconnections (e.g.,\nGarrido et al., 2007 ). The explanatory power of\nsuch models has been demonstrated, for example, by their ability\nto account for age-related changes in ERP responses (\nMoran\net al., 2014 ). Moran et al. (2014) assume that aging emphasizes\nmodel stability and reduces model complexity (avoidance of\noverﬁtting), thus leading to attenuation of Bayesian learn ing.\nIn their words: “The implications for the neurobiology of\naging are that—over the years—cortical message passing may\nbecome more eﬃcient (providing accurate predictions with a\nless redundant or complex hierarchical model) and increasing ly\ndominated by top-down predictions” (\nMoran et al., 2014 , p. 2).\nThis approach allows for the prediction of age from a DCM\nmodel of the MMN.\nFrom this architecture, it is clear that predictive coding\n(i.e., neural message passing containing only the diﬀerence\nbetween the prediction and the actual input) is only part of the\noverall picture. There are other aspects of the architecture t hat\ncould also drive the observed signals, including the model u pdate\nitself, and the encoding of predictions. Moreover, prediction\nerrors are weighted by precision / attention (\nFeldman and\nFriston, 2010; Kok et al., 2012 ). We shall return to this\npoint below.\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 5 February 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 298\nBornkessel-Schlesewsky and Schlesewsky Neurobiology of the N400\nTHE N400 AS A LONG-LATENCY MMN\nIn what follows, we will argue that the N400 is functionally\nsimilar to the MMN, with its longer latency and diﬀerent\ntopography reﬂecting the processing of more complex stimulus\ndimensions and longer temporal receptive windows, rather tha n\na qualitatively diﬀerent mechanism. We will subsequently argu e\nthat this approach can be extended to all language-related\nnegativities. If this assumption holds, it would provide the\nbasis for a deep neurobiological grounding of these observe d\neﬀects, based on the predictive coding framework outlined in t he\npreceding sections.\nThe Dual Importance of Prediction Errors\nand Prediction (Stimulus Probability)\nWe propose a functional link between the N400 and the\nMMN, based on two characteristics of the N400 that mirror\nproperties of the MMN: (a) N400 amplitude reﬂects the degree\nto which an encountered stimulus diverges from an expected\nstimulus (\nFedermeier and Kutas, 1999 ), a property that has\nmore recently been linked to the degree of surprisal associat ed\nwith a word ( Frank et al., 2015 ); and (b) N400 amplitude\ndecreases proportionately to the degree of association betwe en\na word and the context in which it is encountered ( Kutas and\nHillyard, 1984 ). Property (a) has been discussed in terms of\nprediction and prediction errors (cf. Kuperberg and Jaeger, 2016 ,\nfor discussion). However, recall from the N400 and predictio n\nsection that property (b) has led to the critique that N400\namplitude reductions for pre-activated stimuli may be drivin g\nthe response rather than error-related amplitude increases (e .g.,\nVan Petten and Luka, 2012 ). Indeed, in their review, Van\nPetten and Luka (2012) argue that there is little evidence in\nthe literature to suggest that the N400 reﬂects prediction er rors\nrelated to the deviation from a single predicted word. As argu ed\nabove, however, while this pattern may be unexpected from the\nperspective of predictive processing in language in a tradition al\nsense (i.e., active prediction of an individual word; incorr ect\npredictions are costly), it is highly compatible with predicti on as\npart of a predictive coding architecture.\nFigure 2 summarizes the range of eﬀects needing to be\nexplained by a comprehensive account of the N400 (see the\nﬁgure caption for further explanation and relevant reference s).\nWe have already discussed types 1, 2, and 3 in the prediction\nand N400 section as well as above. Types 4 and 5 add an\ninteresting additional perspective, as they can be observed a t\nthe single word level and thus, prima facie, cannot reﬂect\nprediction errors: N400 amplitude is negatively correlated wi th\na word’s frequency of occurrence (type 4); N400 amplitude\nalso increases for pseudowords (i.e., word-like stimuli tha t\nrespect the phonotactic constraints of a given language but ar e\nnot existing words). Furthermore, for both existing and non -\nexisting words, N400 amplitude is positively correlated with\northographic neighborhood density and frequency (type 5),\ni.e., higher N400 amplitudes for higher neighborhood densit y\nN and frequency (\nLaszlo and Federmeier, 2011 ). We assume\nthat these eﬀects can be explained from a predictive coding\nperspective via diﬀerences in a priori probability and uncertain ty\nin stimulus categorization. Frequency eﬀects may reﬂect glob al\npriors accrued over a lifetime of language experience. This al so\nhas the potential to explain why these eﬀects become smaller\nor are even “overridden” by a sentence context when it is\npresent (\nVan Petten and Kutas, 1990 ); for extended evidence\nfrom naturalistic story listening, see Alday et al. (2017) . For\nneighborhood eﬀects, we posit that N400 amplitude may reﬂect\na prediction error (PE) eﬀect somewhat akin to extra-classica l\nreceptive ﬁeld eﬀects in vision (\nRao and Ballard, 1999 ). In\nother words, presentation of a (single) word not only leads to\nthe processing of the word itself but also (at higher cortical\nlevels) to the activation of words that are (semantically or\northographically) related. Feedback connections from thes e\nhigher levels lead to a prediction-error-like response in the\ncase of higher competition, i.e., in the case of a denser\northographic neighborhood, which increases the uncertaint y of\nhaving correctly identiﬁed the word in question. In both cas es,\nit appears plausible to assume that there is a prediction error\ncomponent as well as a prediction component: the composite\nN400 eﬀect results from the combination of an amplitude\nincrease in the less expected case and an amplitude reduction i n\nthe more highly expected case.\nThis overall scenario can also account for N400 modulations\nof types 1 through 3, namely via amplitude increase for\nprediction errors and amplitude reduction for more strongly\npredicted stimuli.\nN400 Effects Reﬂect Precision-Weighted\nPrediction Errors\nMatters become more complicated when we consider scenarios\nin which there is a prediction error, but no N400 amplitude\nmodulation. Semantic reversal anomalies (SRAs) in English an d\nDutch are a case in point (type 6 in Figure 2). SRAs are sentences\ninvolving a role reversal, i.e., sentences which would be plau sible\nif subject and object (actor and undergoer) were to be exchan ged.\nAn example (from\nKim and Osterhout, 2005 ) is given in (1);\nhere, there is a good associative ﬁt between “hearty meals” a nd\n“devour”, but “hearty meals” is in the wrong role in the curre nt\nsentence context:\n(1) The hearty meals were devoring . . .\nThe absence of an N400 modulation for these sentences is\ntypically discussed as reﬂecting a temporary semantic illusi on\n(\nKim and Osterhout, 2005; Kuperberg, 2016 ) or explained\nin terms of the high degree of lexical-semantic association\nbetween the critical word and the sentence context (associa tion-\nbased view of the N400). Thus, the most common current\ninterpretations of these ﬁndings are:\n1. There is no prediction error. This is based on the assumption\nthat, in these sentence types, argument roles are not used to\ngenerate predictions (\nChow et al., 2016b; Kuperberg, 2016 ) or\nthat the generation of such predictions takes too long to be\neﬀective immediately (\nChow et al., 2016a, 2018 ).\n2. N400 amplitude doesn’t reﬂect sentence-level predictions, bu t\nrather lexical-semantic associations / the beneﬁts of sema ntic\ncontext (Brouwer et al., 2012; Van Petten and Luka, 2012 ).\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 6 February 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 298\nBornkessel-Schlesewsky and Schlesewsky Neurobiology of the N400\nFIGURE 2 | N400 modulations needing to be explained by a comprehensive account of the component. Left branches: “classical” N400 e ffects in context and at the\nword level (see, for example Kutas and Federmeier, 2011 ). Right-branches: additional effects at the sentence leve l and above. Effect 6 refers to cross-linguistic\nvariability in the N400 response to semantic reversal anoma lies (SRAs, see Bornkessel-Schlesewsky et al., 2011 ). Effects 7 through 9 and 10 refer to higher-order\ncontext effects and learning effects, respectively (see se ction “The Inﬂuence of Top-Down Modulations / Higher-Order Co ntext Effects” in main text for references).\nFinally, effects 11a and b reﬂect N400 modulations through hi ghly salient input stimuli ( Lotze et al., 2011; Delaney-Busch and Kuperberg, 2013 ), while 12 is related to\nthe actorhood potential of a noun phrase ( Bornkessel-Schlesewsky and Schlesewsky, 2009b, 2013a; Fr enzel et al., 2015 ).\nHowever, both interpretations are problematic in view of\nadditional results. Explanation (a) is not compatible with\nthe ﬁnding that SRAs in English engender early anomaly\neﬀects in eye-tracking measures.\nWeiss et al. (2017) observed\nlonger ﬁrst-pass reading times for SRA sentences vs. control s\nat the position of the critical verb and the post-critical\nregion. While these eﬀects were modulated by the degree of\nsemantic association, they were present in both high and low\nassociation conditions. This result provides strong eviden ce\nagainst the assumption that SRA-type sentences do not engende r\nprediction errors, irrespective of the explanation for why a\nprediction was not generated. It is also incompatible with the\nnotion of a temporary semantic illusion. Explanation (b) is\ncontradicted by the cross-linguistic observation that SRA s do\nelicit N400 eﬀects in languages other than English or Dutch,\ne.g., in German, Turkish, and Mandarin Chinese (\nBornkessel-\nSchlesewsky et al., 2011 )4, and that they can also elicit N400\neﬀects in English under certain circumstances that cannot\nbe explained with reference to changes in lexical-semantic\nrelatedness (\nBourguignon et al., 2012 ). We have previously\nargued that this overall pattern is explained most parsimoniou sly\nwith reference to the types of features that are weighted most\nstrongly for sentence interpretation: while English and Dut ch\nrely strongly on word order cues for interpretation, German,\n4Recent ﬁndings by Chow et al. (2018) appear to contradict the claim that SRAs\nelicit N400 eﬀects in Mandarin—at least when the verb is encount ered immediately\nafter the arguments. However, this ﬁnding in fact replicates the pa ttern of results\nreported for the type of construction in question (b ˘a-constructions) by Bornkessel-\nSchlesewsky et al. (2011) . In our previous paper, we suggested that the absence\nof N400 eﬀects for SRAs in b ˘a-constructions—together with the presence of an\nN400 eﬀect in bèi-constructions—might be due to the availabilit y of an alternative\n(relative clause) analysis in the b ˘a-sentences. This consideration also applies to\nChow et al.’s (2018) results.\nTurkish, and Mandarin Chinese all have a ﬂexible word order\nand draw more strongly on bottom-up cues such as case-markin g\nand animacy.\nWe can thus conclude that, while SRAs induce prediction\nerrors, these are not always reﬂected in N400 amplitude\nmodulations. On the basis of this observation, we posit that,\nrather than reﬂecting prediction error-related activity per se ,\nprediction-related N400 amplitude modulations reﬂect update s\nof the internal generative model. This explains the cross-\nlinguistic ﬁndings on SRAs as follows. SRAs induce predictio n\nerrors in all languages. However, the eﬀects of the mismatch-\ninducing linguistic feature diﬀer from language to language .\nConsider animacy as the prime example of a mismatch-inducing\nfeature in SRAs: the relevance of this feature for sentence- level\ninterpretation is very low in English (as it is always overridd en\nby other features such as word order), but higher in German\nor Turkish and very high in Mandarin Chinese. In other words,\nanimacy has higher cue validity in these languages, as deﬁne d\nwithin the scope of the Competition Model (\nMacWhinney et al.,\n1984; Li et al., 1993 ): a cue is highly valid when it is both\nhigh in applicability (i.e., it is available when needed) and\nhigh in reliability (i.e., it is neither ambiguous nor mislea ding).\nWe propose that cue validity, as a measure of how important\nparticular cues are for interpretation in a given language,\ndetermines the precision of a prediction error induced by that cue\nduring sentence processing. In the predictive coding literat ure,\nit is assumed that the feedforward error signals propagated up\nthe cortical hierarchy are weighted by precision (\nBastos et al.,\n2012), which is deﬁned as the inverse of variance ( Feldman\nand Friston, 2010; Kok et al., 2012 ). The notion of precision\nis thus directly related to the notion of cue reliability, i. e., the\ndegree of variance in the form-to-meaning mapping for an\nindividual cue in sentence interpretation. This proposal acco rds\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 7 February 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 298\nBornkessel-Schlesewsky and Schlesewsky Neurobiology of the N400\nFIGURE 3 | Schematic depiction of a predictive estimator allowing for\nprecision weighting of prediction error signals. The predi ction generated by the\ninternal model is compared against the incoming input (“com parator”). If there\nis a mismatch between the two, a prediction error results. Th e degree to which\nthis prediction error is used to update the model, however, d epends on the\nprecision of the error signal (see main text). This can be ope rationalized via a\nKalman ﬁlter ( Grush, 2004 ), which informally speaking determines to what\nextent the existing model is “trusted” over the current pred iction error or vice\nversa. Modulations of update gain are also important in the c ontext of noise,\nwhich can be present both in the context of the input and in the context of the\nmodel. The architecture shown here can be considered an elab oration of the\npredictive estimators shown in Figure 1A . Neurobiologically,\nprecision-weighting of prediction error signals is though t to be implemented by\nmodulations of the postsynaptic gain of pyramidal cells in s uperﬁcial cortical\nlayers, which serve to propagate the error signal to higher c ortical areas;\ncf. top of Figure 1B .\nwith the intuitive idea that a prediction error induced by a cu e\nthat is typically highly relevant for sentence interpretatio n in a\ngiven language should have a more substantial impact on model\nupdating than a prediction error induced by a cue that is typical ly\nof low relevance for interpretation. Neurobiologically, th is can be\nmodeled by changes in the postsynaptic gain of the pyramidal\ncells in superﬁcial cortical layers that encode prediction er rors\nand propagate these to higher cortical areas (\nBastos et al., 2012 ).\nFigure 3 summarizes the assumed mechanism underlying the\nprecision-weighting of prediction error signals.\nFurther converging support for this proposal stems from\nthe observation that the relevance of a cue for sentence\ninterpretation may change depending on the circumstances in\nwhich it is encountered. For example,\nBornkessel-Schlesewsky\net al. (2011) reported that SRAs in Icelandic engender either\nan “English-type” ERP response (i.e., no N400 eﬀect) or a\n“German-type” ERP response (i.e., an N400 eﬀect) depending\non the sentence type. Constructions requiring word-order-b ased\nargument interpretation (as in English) showed the English-\ntype ERP pattern, while constructions requiring case-based\nargument interpretation (as in German and Turkish) showed\nthe German/Turkish-type ERP pattern. Similar construction-\nbased variability in the ERP-response to SRAs has, in fact,\nbeen observed in English:\nBourguignon et al. (2012) compared\ntypical SRA sentences involving action verbs with SRAs inclu ding\nexperiencer verbs. For the experiencer constructions, they\nobserved an N400 eﬀect for SRAs in comparison to plausible\ncontrols, as well as a late positivity; SRAs with action verbs,\nby contrast, only engendered a late positivity—as in previous\nstudies. We assume that this reﬂects the change in cue releva nce\nfor experiencer verbs: across the languages of the world, non -\ndefault verb classes such as experiencer verbs go hand-in-ha nd\nwith diﬀerent morphosyntactic properties in comparison to\ndefault (action) verbs (for empirical evidence from quantit ative\ntypology, see\nBickel et al., 2014 ). English is no diﬀerent:\nexperiencer verbs can counteract the typical, word-order-ba sed\nAgent-Action-Object template ( Bever, 1970 ) by allowing the\nCauser to be the second argument (e.g., Mary fears the dark )\nand we assume that this increases the relevance of bottom-up\n(non-word-order) cues for sentence interpretation.\nModulations via the contextual relevance of stimulus featur es\nare another characteristic that the N400 shares with the MMN.\nMMN eﬀects to speech sounds (vowels and syllables) are known\nto be modulated by phonemic status, i.e., MMN eﬀects are\ninduced based on whether two vowel sounds, for example,\ncorrespond to the same phoneme category in the listener’s nati ve\nlanguage (or a non-native language in which they are highly\nproﬁcient). Under these circumstances, the MMN is sensitive\nto linguistic representations rather than to acoustic simil arity—\nas is the case in auditory oddball experiments involving tone s\nrather than speech sounds (see\nChristmann et al., 2014 , for\nrecent ﬁndings using speech sounds and complexity-matched\nnon-speech sounds; and\nNäätänen et al., 2007 , for a review).\nThus, the relevance of particular stimulus features for the MMN\nvaries depending on the experimental context: if the stimuli\ncan be mapped to existing linguistic categories, language-spec iﬁc\nlinguistic features play a critical role; by contrast, if the auditory\ninput does not correspond to pre-existing categories, its acous tic\nparameters (e.g., frequency) are of primary relevance. Moreov er,\nthe MMN has also been interpreted as reﬂecting precision-\nweighted prediction errors on the basis of biases introduced by\nhigher-order sound sequences (\nTodd et al., 2014 ).\nThe Inﬂuence of Top-Down Modulations /\nHigher Order Context Effects\nIt has been known for some time that the N400 is sensitive to a\nrange of inﬂuences beyond the current sentence context (\nHagoort\nand van Berkum, 2007 ). Many of these can be explained relatively\nstraightforwardly within the current framework by assumin g\nthat contextual information shapes the current predictive mo del,\nirrespective of whether it is part of the current sentence cont ext\nor not. Here, we discuss a selection of recent ﬁndings which a ttest\nto the exquisite sensitivity of the N400 to subtle manipulatio ns of\nthe top-down predictive environment.\nTroyer and Kutas (2018) examined the role of an individual’s\ndomain-speciﬁc knowledge in eliciting N400 eﬀects by having\nparticipants read sentences from the domain of the Harry\nPotter (HP) novels. Endings that were more or less contextua lly\nsupported within the HP universe showed N400 eﬀects that\nwere graded according to individual participants’ HP knowled ge.\nFor non-HP-related sentence endings, by contrast, there wa s\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 8 February 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 298\nBornkessel-Schlesewsky and Schlesewsky Neurobiology of the N400\na general eﬀect of contextual support. This result (type 7 in\nFigure 2) is exactly in line with the assumptions of predictive\ncoding: internal generative (predictive) models are shaped\nsubstantially by individual expertise.\nFurther results (\nRueschemeyer et al., 2015 ) attest to the\nsensitivity of the N400 to the social context in which a lingu istic\nutterance occurs (the “social-N400 eﬀect”; type 8 in Figure 2).\nIn this study, participants read sentences following an audito rily\npresented context sentence, and performed the experiment eith er\non their own or in the presence of a confederate, who saw\nthe target sentences but did not hear the context sentences.\nTarget sentence endings were either: plausible independent o f\nthe context sentence; implausible independent of the context\nsentence; plausible or implausible depending on the context.\nParticipants who were in the alone-group had the task of\njudging whether they had understood the sentence, while\nparticipants in the joint-group were asked to judge (a) whethe r\nthe confederate understood the sentence, and (b) whether th ey\nthemselves understood the sentence. Participants showed an\nN400 eﬀect for the context condition in comparison to the\nplausible condition only in the presence of a confederate, thu s\nshowing that they adapt their predictive model to the social\ncontext at hand.\nJouravlev et al. (2019) showed that this is also\npossible without explicit task instructions. These ﬁndings a re\nagain fully compatible with a predictive coding perspective, as\npredictive coding has previously been argued to extend to soci al\ninteractions including theory of mind (\nKoster-Hale and Saxe,\n2013). Once again, we view this as attesting to the ﬂexibility of\npredictive model adaptation depending on prior knowledge and\nthe current context (for related results involving the soci al status\nof a speaker, see\nBornkessel-Schlesewsky et al., 2013 ).\nSimilar considerations hold for modulations of the N400 by\ntask environment (type 9 in Figure 2). As shown by Chwilla\net al. (1995) , N400 priming eﬀects elicited by word pairs in the\ncontext of a lexical decision task were not present in the cont ext\nof a physical task (case judgement). This demonstrates that\npredictive models are adapted to best ﬁt the current environme nt:\nin the absence of a broader context, prediction between the\nindividual words of a word pair is strengthened through the\nintra-experimental context (i.e., the fact that, of the word\npairs presented, some are semantically related). This knowle dge,\nhowever, is only relevant when participants are performing a\nlexical decision task, and thus does not inﬂuence the predict ive\nmodel in the context of a physical task. The scenario changes\nwhen the linguistic input contains intrinsic predictive proper ties,\nas is the case in the presence of a sentence or discourse contex t.\nAccordingly, N400 eﬀects are observable under such conditio ns\neven in the absence of an explicit, meaning-probing task (see,\nfor example, (\nAlday et al., 2017 ), for evidence from naturalistic\nstory comprehension)5.\n5At a ﬁrst glance, this line of argumentation may appear incompatible wi th the\nfact that N400 eﬀects are elicited even in the context of attent ional blink scenarios\n(i.e., when a second target stimulus following in close proximity to a ﬁrst target\ntends to be missed in terms of behavioral responses). However, in con trast to the\nexperimental design by Chwilla et al. (1995) , attential blink designs necessarily\ninvolve marking the words in question as targets by (form-based) in formation\nof some sort. For example, Rolke et al. (2001) observed an N400 priming eﬀect\nModel Flexibility / Learning\nThe ﬁndings on domain-speciﬁc knowledge discussed above\nsuggest that individuals must be able to ﬂexibly learn, i.e., adapt\ntheir predictive models to new environmental probabilities.\nThis process can, apparently, be very rapid if the learning\nenvironment is suﬃciently speciﬁc/informative.\nBorovsky et al.\n(2012) exposed participants to high and low constraint sentences\n(from Federmeier and Kutas, 1999 , see the “Prediction and\nthe N400” section). These involved either plausible/expected\ncompletions or were completed with an unknown pseudoword.\nSubsequently, participants were presented with a word-pair\npriming paradigm, comprising identical, related, and unrelated\nword pairs. Strikingly, N400 priming eﬀects were induced by\nunknown word primes after only a single exposure to these\nnovel words in context. However, this was only the case when\nthe pseudoword had appeared in a high-constraint context.\nThis suggests that learning/model adaptation can be very rapi d,\noccurring with just one exposure. However, this is contingent\non the evidence being strong enough during that single-shot\nexposure to warrant a model update—likely to avoid overﬁtting\nthrough unnecessary model adaptations to any unpredicted\nstimulus (cf.\nMoran et al., 2014 ).\nEXTENSION TO OTHER\nLANGUAGE-RELATED NEGATIVITIES\nIn the preceding section, we argued that the N400 shares\ncrucial characteristics with the MMN and that—given the\navailability of detailed, neurobiologically grounded acc ounts of\nthe MMN—viewing the two ERP components as part of the same\nfamily opens up potentially important new perspectives on the\nneurobiological mechanisms underlying the N400. Speciﬁcal ly,\nwe have posited that both the MMN and the N400:\na reﬂect dual aspects of stimulus prediction (leading to an\namplitude decrease for predicted stimuli) and prediction error\n(leading to an amplitude increase for stimuli that do not match\nan existing prediction);\nb are sensitive to the contextual relevance of stimulus feat ures,\nsuch that only currently relevant features give rise to\na prediction-error-related response (precision-weighted\nprediction errors);\nWe assume that the N400 is thus essentially a long-latency\nMMN, with the latency diﬀerence reﬂecting the higher stimulus\ncomplexity in N400 paradigms. This mirrors the well-known\nlatency shifts of the P300 in response to the complexity of\nstimulus analysis (cf.\nDonchin and Coles, 1988; Polich, 2007 ,\namong many others). An MMN-type response with a longer\nlatency than the classic MMN—known as the late MMN or late\neven when the prime word was missed as part of an attential blink paradigm. In\nthis study, target 1, prime and probe were presented embedded in a word lis t,\neach marked as targets by their white font color within a list of bla ck distractor\nwords. Thus, even though the processing of the prime word may not have “ reached\nconsciousness” as signaled by a correct target response, it was ne vertheless ﬂagged\nas a task-relevant stimulus by its form features (color) within the co ntext of this\nexperimental design. We assume that this is suﬃcient for some form o f predictive\nprocessing to be initiated as part of a predictive coding framework.\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 9 February 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 298\nBornkessel-Schlesewsky and Schlesewsky Neurobiology of the N400\ndiscriminatory negativity (LDN)—has, in fact, also been re ported\nin the literature. The late MMN manifests itself at fronto-cen tral\nelectrode sites, with a latency of approximately 300 to 600 ms, and\noccurs in response to complex auditory stimuli (e.g., syllable s,\nwords) as well as auditory rule extraction (e.g., Zachau et al.,\n2005). It has been proposed that these two ERP responses form\npart of a hierarchically organized predictive coding system, with\nthe early MMN reﬂecting local regularities (predictions) and\nthe late MMN reﬂecting higher-order regularities or predictio ns\n(\nWacongne et al., 2011 ). From this perspective, functionally\nrelated negativities with diﬀering latencies and topographie s—\nreﬂecting diﬀerent underlying neural generators—arise as a\nresult of the hierarchical cortical system that is assumed t o\nunderlie perceptual inference and predictive coding in the\nhuman brain. In essence, we can conceive of this as a similar\nmechanism occurring throughout a distributed network, nam ely\nthe matching of top-down prediction signals to bottom-up\nsensory/prediction error signals. Precision-weighted pred iction\nerror signals can arise in various loci throughout this netw ork,\nas part of one sweep through the hierarchically organized\nsystem, and likely even in multiple loci at once for a complex\nstimulus such as language. Accordingly, these signals—tho ugh\nfunctionally equivalent—can manifest with diﬀerent latenc ies\nand topographies in scalp-recorded EEG, depending on their\npoint of elicitation within this complex system.\nIn addition to positing that the N400 forms part of this\nfamily of predictive coding-related negativities, we propose that\nan explanation along these lines can be extended to other\nlanguage-related negativities such as the left-anterior n egativity\n(LAN). The LAN, which has a similar latency to the N400,\nwas traditionally associated with morphosyntactic violati ons such\nas violations of subject-verb agreement (e.g.,\nFriederici, 2002 ).\nHowever, there is not a clear one-to-one mapping between\nthe occurrence of a morphosyntactic processing problem\nand the occurrence of a LAN eﬀect: sentences containing\nmorphosyntactic violations or requiring a reanalysis (cued\nby a morphosyntactic information source, e.g., word order\nreanalysis on the basis of subject-verb agreement informat ion)\nhave been shown to engender N400 eﬀects in a number of\nexperiments; in other cases, morphosyntactic violations onl y\nelicited late positivity eﬀects without a preceding LAN (or oth er\nnegativity) (see\nSassenhagen et al., 2014 , for a summary of\nrelevant ﬁndings).\nWe have previously argued that LAN eﬀects may reﬂect\nmorpheme-based expectations ( Bornkessel-Schlesewsky and\nSchlesewsky, 2009a ), i.e., prediction-error-related activity in the\nmorphemic domain. From this perspective, the LAN could be\naﬀorded a similar functional interpretation to the MMN and the\nN400, with the topographical and latency diﬀerences between\nthe three components reﬂecting diﬀerences in the input feature s\nthat are relevant for engendering the prediction error (see a lso\nBornkessel-Schlesewsky and Schlesewsky, 2013b ). By extension,\nearly LAN (ELAN) eﬀects elicited by word category violations\n(e.g.,\nNeville et al., 1991; Hahne and Friederici, 2002 ) could reﬂect\nprediction error eﬀects in the context of unpredictable catego ry\nsequences (but see Steinhauer and Drury, 2012 , for a critical\ndiscussion of ELAN eﬀects).\nNote that our assumptions about the LAN are, at present,\na conjecture. While they provide a parsimonious explanation\nfor language-related negativities in general, they clearly require\nexperimental validation. To date, there is mostly evidence t o\nsupport a prediction-error-based enhancement of the LAN,\nrather than the dual aspects of prediction and prediction error\n(involving a clear prediction-related attenuation) as disc ussed\nabove for the MMN and the N400. It is not clear whether this\nis due to the characteristics of the experimental designs whi ch\nhave been used to study the LAN and which may not have\nbeen suited to revealing prediction-related aspects, or whet her\nit should be attributed to characteristics of the component\nitself. For example, while classic N400-eliciting designs suc h as\nvariations of cloze probability oﬀer a straightforward means of\ndiﬀerentiating between highly predictable, neutral, and hig hly\nunpredictable continuations, this is not possible in the same w ay\nin typical morphosyntactic manipulations. Consider subject-ve rb\nagreement: here, the agreement features are either predicte d or\nunpredicted (in the case of a violation), but—at least typical ly—\nthere is no middle ground. This makes it diﬃcult to disentangl e\nprediction-related and prediction-error-related aspects of the\neﬀect. Also, there is no direct evidence as yet to support\nthe idea that LAN eﬀects, like N400 eﬀects, reﬂect precision-\nweighted prediction error responses rather than prediction er rors\nper se . However, though there is no compelling empirical\nevidence to date, the assumption that LAN eﬀects also reﬂect\nprecision-weighted prediction errors could have the potential\nto explain why morphosyntactic manipulations sometimes elicit\nLAN eﬀects, while under other circumstances they do not (for\na review, see\nBornkessel-Schlesewsky and Schlesewsky, 2009a ).\nThis otherwise somewhat puzzling observation has already be en\ndiscussed in the context of possible diﬀerences between diﬀere nt\nmorphosyntactic agreement features ( Nevins et al., 2007 )—an\nidea that is clearly related to our proposal here.\nIn summary, we propose here that language-related\nnegativities – including the N400, LAN and ELAN – form\npart of a functionally and neurobiologically unitary family of\ncomponents which, like the MMN, index precision-weighted\nprediction errors. The latency and topography of the resulting\nnegativity eﬀects is assumed to reﬂect the locus of the predict ion\nerror within the overall, hierarchically organized cortica l\narchitecture (cf.\nBornkessel-Schlesewsky and Schlesewsky,\n2013b). To some extent, the latency of the resulting negativity\neﬀects is thus also expected to mirror the relative genesis of\nthe prediction error within the overall cascade. We delibera tely\nsay “to some extent, ” as hierarchical cortical organizatio n does\nnot imply a perfect feed-forward architecture. Rather, diﬀere nt\nlevels of the hierarchy are typically connected bidirection ally;\nfurthermore, connections can be long-range, i.e., “skip”\nindividual levels (e.g,.\nBar, 2003; Kravitz et al., 2013 ). Thus,\nthe time-space-correspondence (TSC) of prediction error\neﬀects (\nBornkessel-Schlesewsky and Schlesewsky, 2013b ) can\nbe assumed to be imperfect at best. Nevertheless, the existing\nliterature provides at least some evidence for TSC in a restri cted\nsense. As evidenced by MEG studies of sentence reading, word\ncategory violations engender early (M100) prediction error\neﬀects localized to visual cortex (\nDikker et al., 2009 ). Moreover,\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 10 February 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 298\nBornkessel-Schlesewsky and Schlesewsky Neurobiology of the N400\nthese eﬀects are modulated by form typicality ( Dikker et al.,\n2010), i.e., they occur only for orthographically typical nouns\n(e.g., “the tastelessly soda” vs. “the tasteless soda”) but not\nfor orthographically atypical nouns (e.g., “the cutely infant”\nvs. “the cute infant”). These results suggest that, when the\npredictive model is precise enough, the language comprehensio n\nsystem generates predictions right down to the level of expect ed\nsensory—in this case orthographic—inputs. In this case,\nprediction error eﬀects can be observed “early”, both in terms o f\ntiming and in terms of the cortical hierarchy. Similar eﬀects have\nbeen observed for semantically-based prediction eﬀects (\nDikker\nand Pylkkänen, 2011 ), thus attesting to the importance of the\nprediction itself rather than the information used to genera te it.\nRELATION TO LANGUAGE-RELATED\nPOSITIVITIES\nOur proposed approach to language-related negativities\ncontrasts with our perspective on language-related positivit y\neﬀects (e.g., the P600). As we have discussed in detail elsewh ere\n(\nSassenhagen et al., 2014; Sassenhagen and Bornkessel-\nSchlesewsky, 2015 ), we view these eﬀects as part of the P300\nfamily (see also e.g., Gunter et al., 1997; Coulson et al., 1998 ).\nSpeciﬁcally, we follow Nieuwenhuis et al. (2005) in assuming that\nthe P300 reﬂects a phasic release of noradrenaline by the locu s\ncoeruleus (LC), a brainstem nucleus, to motivationally sign iﬁcant\nstimuli (the “LC-P3 model”). This leads to a stronger neuron al\nreactivity (gain) to the stimuli in question, thereby optimi zing the\nappropriate behavioral reaction. As shown by Sassenhagen et al.\n(2014) and Sassenhagen and Bornkessel-Schlesewsky (2015) ,\nP600 eﬀects share a number of characteristics with the P300 as\nexpected from the perspective of the LC-P3 model, including\nsingle-trial-based locking of P600 latency to behavioral o utcomes\n(reaction time) and correlation with other physiological re actions\ntied to the (LC-initiated) orienting response (e.g., galvan ic skin\nresponse, GSR). Thus, in comparison to language-related\nnegativities, which are stimulus-locked, language-relat ed\npositivities are response-locked, thereby reﬂecting their c loser\nlink to the behavioral consequences of a predictive coding\nresponse, rather than to predictive coding per se.\nRELATION TO EXISTING THEORIES\nComparison to Existing Accounts of the\nN400\nThe key diﬀerence between our proposal and existing accounts\nof the N400 is our assumption that the N400’s prediction-error -\nrelated component reﬂects precision-weighted prediction errors,\nwith precision (the inverse of variance) reﬂecting the relev ance\nof a particular stimulus feature in a given language. At some\nlevels, “relevance” may be immutable for a particular langua ge—\nfor example, in the case of the phonetic features that do or do\nnot give rise to phonemic contrasts. In other cases, it may be\nmore context-dependent: at the level of sentence interpretat ion,\nfor example, we have argued that cue validity in the sense of\nthe Competition Model (e.g.,\nMacWhinney et al., 1984 ) can\nbe used as a proxy for relevance/precision, but the importance\nof an individual cue such as case marking or word order can\nchange depending on the construction being processed (see the\nabove discussion of the data from Icelandic and English by\n(\nBornkessel-Schlesewsky et al., 2011; Bourguignon et al., 2 012),\nrespectively). Precision-weighting of prediction errors has not\npreviously been proposed in the context of the N400 or other\nlanguage-related negativities (but see e.g.,\nTodd et al., 2014 , for\nthe MMN).\nOur account also diﬀers from other current approaches\nto the functional signiﬁcance of the N400 in assuming that\nthe N400 is functionally equivalent to the MMN as well\nas to other language-related negativities. We hope to have\nshown how the assumption that the N400 reﬂects similar\nbasic neural mechanisms as the MMN opens up a whole\nhost of new possibilities for ERP-based language research\non the neurobiology of language. These could build on the\ndetailed neurobiological accounts of hierarchical predict ive\ncoding that have been put forward and linked to the MMN,\nincluding, for example, the proposed separability between unit s\nencoding predictions and those encoding prediction errors\nwithin canonical neural microcircuits (\nBastos et al., 2012 ).\nMoreover, by not restricting our assumptions to semantic\ninformation—as is the case in most, if not all, competing\napproaches—we are able to derive non-semantic N400 eﬀects,\ne.g., increased N400 amplitudes for disambiguation toward a\nnon-preferred word order (e.g.,\nBornkessel et al., 2004; Haupt\net al., 2008; Hörberg et al., 2013 ) and for case violations (e.g.,\nFrisch and Schlesewsky, 2001 )6.\nOf course, our proposal also shares a number of\ncommonalities with existing approaches to the N400. It\nshares the assumption of semantic memory-based accounts\n(e.g.,\nLau et al., 2008; Brouwer et al., 2012; Stroud and Phillips,\n2012; Van Petten and Luka, 2012; Chow et al., 2016b ) that\nN400 amplitudes are reduced for stimuli that ﬁt into the\ncurrent semantic context or have a high a priori probability\nin the absence of a context (e.g., high frequency words). By\ncontrast, and in line with surprisal-based accounts (\nFrank et al.,\n2015; Kuperberg and Jaeger, 2016 ), we also assume that N400\namplitude reﬂects prediction errors—at least in part. In a recen t\nproposal that is conceptually related to the update of an interna l\nmodel via prediction error signals, Rabovsky et al. (2018) view\nthe N400 as indexing the change in an implicit and probabilisti c\nmeaning representation that is elicited by an incoming stimu lus.\nFrom this perspective, N400 amplitude reﬂects the magnitude\nof the update as simulated within a computational (neural\nnetwork) model (cf. also\nRabovsky and McRae, 2014 , in\nwhich N400 eﬀects are simulated as semantic netowrk errors).\nThus, while entertaining related notions of a continuous\nmodel update with surprisal-based accounts and\nRabovsky\net al. (2018) ’s computational model, our proposal diﬀers in\n6We assume that it is no accident that such non-semantic N400 eﬀe cts seem\nto appear predominantly in languages other than English. This relates o nce\nagain to the notion of precision-weighting, i.e., the dominanc e of word order\ncues for sentence interpretation in English, as a result of which th ese—mostly\nmorphology-based—eﬀects do not occur.\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 11 February 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 298\nBornkessel-Schlesewsky and Schlesewsky Neurobiology of the N400\nassuming a key role of precision weighting 7. This additional\nassumption is necessary in order to explain the cross-linguist ic\nand construction-based variability of N400 eﬀects (cf. type 6 in\nFigure 2 and the section “N400 eﬀects reﬂect precision-weighted\nprediction errors”).\nFinally, like several other existing proposals ( Kuperberg, 2016;\nChow et al., 2018 ), we assume a processing architecture that\ngenerates and tests predictions at a number of diﬀerent levels\nand, potentially, at diﬀering timescales. In contrast to thes e other\napproaches, however, we view the diﬀerent predictive levels as\nlinked to the hierarchical organization of a cortical predic tive\ncoding architecture, within which predictions are generate d and\ntested at each level. From our perspective, timescale diﬀerenc es\ngo hand-in-hand with the increasing length of temporal recept ive\nwindows at increasingly higher levels of the hierarchy (\nHasson\net al., 2008; Lerner et al., 2011; Bornkessel-Schlesewsky e t al.,\n2015; Kandylaki et al., 2016 ), and prediction/prediction-error\neﬀects may be elicited at any level of the hierarchy—likely at\nmultiple levels in many cases 8. The negative ERP responses\nreﬂecting predictive processing and its dual components of\nprediction and prediction error are assumed to show diﬀerent\nlatencies and topographies depending on the networks within\nthe overall architecture in which they are generated (cf.\nMoran\net al., 2014 , for age-related changes in the connectivity of\nnetworks underlying the MMN; and Wacongne et al., 2011 , for\nevidence of hierarchical diﬀerences in information processi ng\nand concomitant changes in the MMN) 9.\nComparison to Other Existing Accounts of\nLanguage-Related ERP Components\nBeyond the N400 literature, the assumption that language-\nrelated negative ERP responses reﬂect predictive processing\nat multiple, hierarchically organized levels also provides a\nlink between the current approach and a body of work by\nShtyrov, Pulvermüller and colleagues, in which they used MMN\noddball paradigms to examine linguistic manipulations (e.g. ,\nShtyrov and Pulvermüller, 2002; Pulvermüller and Shtyrov,\n2003\n). The results of these studies revealed MMN modulations\nfor diﬀerent types of linguistic violations, including subje ct-verb\n7Similar considerations hold in comparison to a range of other approaches to\nmodeling the N400, e.g., Cheyette and Plaut (2017) , who model N400 eﬀects\nas “transient over-activation within semantic networks”. Whi le these authors\nexplicitly criticize approaches to the N400 based on implicit prediction error (e.g.,\nRabovsky and McRae, 2014 ) and therefore model N400 amplitude as directly\nreﬂecting semantic activity in a neural network, it is unclear how this model\ncould reproduce the cross-linguistic variability in the N400 given t hat the semantic\nrelations are comparable in each case.\n8The exact functional speciﬁcation of the diﬀerent levels remains u nknown at\npresent. We have suggested previously that, for language processing , these could\ncorrespond approximately to linguistic units of diﬀerent sizes and time scales,\nsuch as phonemes, morphemes, words, clauses etc. (\nBornkessel-Schlesewsky and\nSchlesewsky, 2013b; Bornkessel-Schlesewsky et al., 2015 ). This assumption is in\nline with fMRI evidence ( Lerner et al., 2011 ) and with results on the entrainment\nof oscillatory neural activity to diﬀerent levels of linguistic cate gories within the\nspeech stream ( Luo and Poeppel, 2007; Ding et al., 2016 ).\n9Note that we restrict our account to focal, language-related negat ivities. Sustained\nnegativities such as the sustained left-anterior negativity (sLAN) likely reﬂect\ndiﬀerent underlying mechanisms (cf. Bornkessel-Schlesewsky and Schlesewsky,\n2009a, for discussion).\nagreement ( Shtyrov and Pulvermüller, 2002; Pulvermüller and\nShtyrov, 2003; Hasting et al., 2007 ), word category ( Hasting\net al., 2007 ) and semantic violations ( Menning et al., 2005;\nShtyrov and Pulvermüller, 2007 ), thus leading the authors to\nconclude that N400s and other late language-related eﬀects\nare not informative with regard to the timecourse of languag e\nprocessing. Rather, all relevant processes (phonological, le xical,\nsyntactic, and semantic) are thought to take place before 200\nms in a near-simultaneous, cascaded form (\nPulvermüller et al.,\n2009), as reﬂected in the MMN ﬁndings. N400, LAN, and\nother later eﬀects, by contrast, are assumed to be indicative\nof either a second stage of information processing or a “post-\nprocessing” stage. We agree with Pulvermüller, Shtyrov and\ncolleagues that there are likely language-related eﬀects tha t\nprecede the N400, LAN, and other late components. This is\nto be expected within a hierarchically organized predictive\nprocessing architecture in which predictions are generated a nd\ntested at a number of diﬀerent levels and timescales. However ,\nrather than viewing later eﬀects as reﬂecting secondary or\npost-processing stages, we would assume that they are merely\nreﬂections of predictive processing at higher hierarchical l evels\nand, thereby, reﬂect processing at higher levels of complexit y\n(cf.\nSimon, 1962 ). Given the organization of the hierarchical\npredictive coding architecture, in which prediction errors a t\nlower levels are propagated up the hierarchy and thereby induc e\ncontinuous model updating at various hierarchical levels, i t\nappears highly likely that linguistic prediction errors at low\nlevels will often be accompanied by higher-level prediction\nerrors. For example, when predicting a particular word, there\nmay ﬁrst be a mismatch between the predicted speech sounds\nand those actually encountered, but this will necessarily al so\namount to a prediction mismatch with regard to the identity\nand meaning of the word—and possibly other aspects such as\nits word category as well. From this perspective, multiple eﬀects\nat diﬀerent timescales may reﬂect the overall operation of the\npredictive coding system and arise as a natural consequence of\nits hierarchical organization.\nNote also that we do not assume that meaning is accessed\nat a single level within the hierarchically organized predict ive\ncoding architecture. Rather, it emerges as a result of the sy stem’s\ndynamics as a whole. In this regard, we agree with\nKutas and\nFedermeier (2011) , who stated in their review of 30 years of\nthe N400 literature that “the meaning of a stimulus is not\ncomputed at a single point in time, but rather is something\nthat emerges through time, with the activity measured in the\nN400 representing an important aspect of that emergent process,\nbut not, certainly, the ﬁnal state” (p. 642)—nor, we would add,\nnecessarily the ﬁrst state.\nComparison to Other, Broader Accounts of\nEvent-Related Potential Components\nWe claim here that N400 eﬀects and other language-related\nnegativities reﬂect internal model updates via precision-wei ghted\nprediction error signals. Conceptually, this proposal appears\nrather similar to the context updating theory of the P300\n(\nDonchin and Coles, 1988 ). While this is indeed the case, we view\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 12 February 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 298\nBornkessel-Schlesewsky and Schlesewsky Neurobiology of the N400\nthe current range of evidence as more strongly supporting the\nnotion of model updating within the N400 (and other negativit y\neﬀects) as opposed to the P300 (or language-related positivity\neﬀects). Two key arguments of the context updating approach\nwere that P300 amplitude reﬂects subjective probability of a\nstimulus and that it is not strongly linked to behavior/task\nexecution, as revealed by an absence of a correlation with re action\ntime (RT). As discussed in the “Relation to language-related\npositivities” section above, however, more recent ﬁndings i ndeed\nshow that P300 eﬀects are stongly RT-locked at the single trial\nlevel; this also holds for P600 eﬀects in language and contras ts\nwith the stimulus-locked nature of N400 eﬀects (\nSassenhagen\net al., 2014; Sassenhagen and Bornkessel-Schlesewsky, 201 5).\nThus, there does appear to be a closer link between the P300\nand behavioral consequences of a model update than to the\n(stimulus-driven) model update itself. This is in line with\nthe assumptions of the LC-P3 model, in which the increase\nin neuronal gain to a salient stimulus that is accompanied\nby the P300 supports appropriate behavioral action execution.\nMoreover, it has become apparent that P300 eﬀects can occur\neven when no model update is necessary, e.g., for self-relevan t\nstimuli such as one’s own name (see\nBrilmayer et al., 2018 ,\nfor a brief review and an application to language processing).\nThis supports the LC-P3’s assumption that P300 eﬀects\nreﬂect the motivational salience of a stimulus rather than i ts\nsubjective probability.\nFinally, note that the assumption that negative ERP responses\nsuch as the MMN and N400 may warrant a uniﬁed functional\nexplanation has been put forward previously (\nKotchoubey,\n2006). In his approach, negativities are assumed to reﬂect\nsensory expectations (“questions”), while positivities suc h as the\nP300 are assumed to reﬂect feedback (“answers”) that either\nconﬁrms or updates these expectations. Cortical information\nprocessing thus operates on the basis of this question—answer\ncycle, reﬂected in a general negativity—positivity ERP patter n.\nApplied to language comprehension,\nKotchoubey (2006) posits\nthat N400 and LAN eﬀects reﬂect the building up of a “model of\npossible content” (p. 59) under conditions of high uncertaint y.\nThis leads to the scanning for further information by neural\nassemblies and, ultimately, a positive ERP component (e.g., a\nP600) when the crucial information is obtained. Thus, while the\ncurrent approach concurs with (\nKotchoubey, 2006 ) observation\nthat “ERP components, thus construed, do not reﬂect the activi ty\nof specialized modules like syntax and semantics, but rather , the\nsame basic ups and downs of cortical activity underlying the\ncontrol of behavior, verbal behavior being a speciﬁc form the reof”\n(p. 59), the functional interpretation of negativite and posit ive\nERP components oﬀered here is quite diﬀerent to his. Similar\nconsiderations apply in regard to Kotchoubey’s neurobiologi cal\nassumptions. Like the predictive coding approach (\nFriston, 2005;\nBastos et al., 2012 ), he posits a functional separability between\nactivity in superﬁcial and deep cortical layers. Kotchoubey\nassumes, however, the formulation of expectations—as\nreﬂected in negative ERP responses—is associated with\nactivity in superﬁcial layers and feedforward connections, while\nfeedback connections arising in deep layers are associated with\nexpectation conﬁrmation or updates (i.e., the basic anatomic al\nassumptions are the inverse of those posited within the predicti ve\ncoding framework).\nOUTLOOK AND HYPOTHESES\nAs noted at the beginning of this paper, our objective here\nwas to put forward a new perspective on the functional\ninterpretation of negative language-related ERP components\nand their neurobiological foundations. Our approach is\nmotivated by recent advances regarding the neurobiology of\nperception and cognition—notably the notion of perceptual\ninference, as supported by a hierarchically organized, corti cal\npredictive architecture—and a critical synthesis of the\nlanguage-related ERP literature. Nevertheless, it remains , at\npresent, a proposal that requires further concretization and\nempirical testing.\nPerhaps most importantly, the notion of precision-based\nweighting of prediction errors needs to be operationalized\nfurther and quantiﬁed. It will be crucial to test quantitati ve\nhypotheses in this regard; otherwise, precision-weighting co uld\nbe used in a relatively arbitrary manner to account for eﬀects\nof varying amplitudes or absent eﬀects that cannot otherwise be\nexplained. We suggest that, in a ﬁrst instance, cue validity i n\nthe sense of the Competition Model (\nMacWhinney et al., 1984 )\n(or, possibly, as measured empirically via speaker judgements;\nAlday et al., 2015 ) could be used to quantify the precision of\nfeatures related to sentence interpretation. The hypothesiz ed\nimpact of this precision weighting can be examined most direct ly\nin simple transitive sentences with default verb classes (acti on\nverbs) in order to avoid inﬂuences of contextually-induced\nmodulations, which may prove more complex to quantify. The\nexamination of annotated naturalistic stories could prove to\nbe a key approach in this regard (\nAlday et al., 2017 ; see\nalso Frank et al., 2015 for a related approach using visually\npresented sentences, and Brennan et al., 2012 , for an approach\nusing fMRI).\nFinally, selected testable hypotheses arising from our\napproach are:\n• Separable eﬀects of prediction and prediction errors in\nlanguage-related negativities. This follows from the\nassumption that predictions and prediction errors are\nencoded by diﬀerent units. In addition to applying to ERPs,\nthis hypothesis also relates to oscillatory brain activity. In\nline with the observation that feedforward, prediction-err or-\nrelated activity is conveyed at high frequencies, while feed back,\nprediction-related activity is conveyed at lower frequenci es\n(\nBastos et al., 2012 ), we hypothesize that prediction and\nprediction-error-related frequency activity in language w ill\nshow a comparable dissociation.\n• Diﬀerent levels of prediction tied to hierarchical predictive\ncycles. In the current approach, diﬀerent levels of prediction\nare assumed to be directly tied to diﬀerent levels of\nthe hierarchical cortical predictive coding architecture. The\ntemporal receptive windows (TRW) associated with these\ndiﬀerent levels (cf.\nHasson et al., 2008; Lerner et al., 2011;\nBornkessel-Schlesewsky et al., 2015; Kandylaki et al., 201 6)\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 13 February 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 298\nBornkessel-Schlesewsky and Schlesewsky Neurobiology of the N400\nprovide an upper bound on the length of individual predictive\ncycles. TRW length can be estimated empirically by examining\nthe entrainment between oscillatory EEG/MEG activity and\nlinguistic units in the speech input (\nDing et al., 2016 ).\nAUTHOR’S NOTE\nThis manuscript was written in RMarkdown using the R package\npapaja (\nAust and Barth, 2018 ).\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nIB-S and MS jointly conceived the theory and hypotheses\npresented here and wrote the paper.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nIB-S acknowledges the support of an Australian Research Counci l\nFuture Fellowship (FT160100437).\nREFERENCES\nAlday, P.
