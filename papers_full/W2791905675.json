    "abstract": "An expert system as an expert knowledge-based information system has been widely used by interested parties to consult their problems. Therefore, an expert system should be well designed so as to meet the requirements for a software to store knowledge, explain problems, and recommend solutions. The purpose of the present study is to develop a systematic design of an expert system using Unified Modeling Language (UML), which is one of popular object-oriented modeling languages. The research method was a literature review as the main source for analyzing the expert system requirements. The developed design was then clarified, verified, and validated in a Focus Group Discussion (FGD). To evaluate the model, a review of some related studies was conducted. The research respondents were informatics lecturers at UIN Sunan Gunung Djati Bandung. The results of the study revealed that the systematic design of expert system was well-developed because it was user-friendly, flexible, easy to be modified, and able to propose solutions for various problems.",
