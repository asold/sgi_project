The trees from our analyses are in good \nagreement to the latest classification of large dsDNA viruses and parvoviruses by the International Committee on \nTaxonomy of Viruses (ICTV).\nConclusions: The present method provides a new way for recovering the phylogeny of large dsDNA viruses and \nparvoviruses, and also some insights on the affiliation of a number of unclassified viruses. In comparison, some \nalignment-free methods such as the CV Tree method can be used for recovering the phylogeny of large dsDNA viruses, \nbut they are not suitable for resolving the phylogeny of parvoviruses with a much smaller genome size.\nBackground\nViruses were traditionally characterized by morphologi-\ncal features (capsid size, shape, structure, etc) and physic-\nochemical and antigenic properties [1]. At the DNA level,\nthe evolutionary relationships of many families and gen-\nera have been explored by sequence analysis of single\ngene or gene families, such as polymerase, capsid and\nmovement genes [1]. The International Committee on\nthe Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) publishes a report on\nthe virus taxonomy system every five years. Phylogenetic\nand taxonomic studies of viruses based on complete\ngenome data have become increasingly important as\nmore and more whole viral genomes are sequenced [2-6]\nThe phylogeny based on single genes or gene families\ncontains ambiguity because horizontal gene transfer\n(HGT), along with gene duplication and gene capture\nfr o m  h o sts,  a p pear  t o  be  fr eq u e n t i n  l ar g e  D N A  vi ruses\n[7-10]. Whether single-gene ba sed analysis can properly\ninfer viral species phylogeny is debatable [2]. One of the\nunusual aspects of viral genomes is that they exhibit high\nsequence divergence [7,11]. Several works have\nattempted to infer viral phylogeny from their whole\ngenomes [1,2,4,8,12-19]. Among these studies of genome\ntrees, the alignment-free methods proposed by Gao and\nQ i  [ 1 ] ,  W u  et  a l  [ 2 ] ,  Gao  et al  [1 2 ] an d  S t ua rt  et  a l  [ 1 6 ]\nseem to be sufficiently powerful to resolve the phylogeny\nof viruses at large evolutionary distance.

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:192\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/192\nPage 2 of 11\ndate the phylogeny of two virus groups of different\ngenome size, the large dsDNA viruses and parvoviruses.\nThe DNA of DNA viruses is usually double-stranded\n(dsDNA), but may also be single-stranded (ssDNA).\nAccording to the VIIIth Report of the International Com-\nmittee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) [20], the dsDNA\nviruses can be classified into certain families or unas-\nsigned genus. The genome sizes of dsDNA viruses are\nusually larger than 10 kb except those in the families Poly-\nomaviridae (5 kb) and Papillomaviridae (7-8 kb). On the\nother hand, the genome sizes of ssDNA viruses are\nsmaller than 10 kb. The parvoviruses constitute a family\nestablished in 1970 to encompass all small non-enveloped\nviruses with approximately 5 kb linear, self-priming,\nssDNA genomes [21,22]. According to the VIIIth Report\nof the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses\n(ICTV) [20], this family is separated into two subfamilies,\nParvovirinae and Densovirinae. Viruses in the subfamily\nParvovirinae infect vertebrates and vertebrate cell cul-\ntures, and frequently associate with other viruses, while\nthose in the subfamily Densovirinae infect arthropods or\nother invertebrates [23,24]. Dependovirus requires co-\ninfection with herpes or adenovirus for replication and is\nnot itself pathogenic [22]. Due to the fatal nature of infec-\ntion with densoviruses on their respective species, it has\nbeen suggested that densoviruses may represent suitable\nvectors for insect control [24,25]. The regions of identity\nand similarity between genomes of human and rodent\nparvoviruses and their respective hosts have been studied\n[2 6 ] .  M o r e  f ea t u r es o f  pa rv o vi ru ses  ca n  be  f o u n d  i n  t h e\nreviews by Tattersall and Cotmore [22].\nThe whole genome sequences are generally accepted as\nexcellent tools for studying evolution [27]. On the basis of\ncharacters used to cluster genomes, Snel et al [28]\nreviewed that genome trees can be globally divided into\nfive classes: alignment-free genome trees based on statis-\ntic properties of the complete genome, gene content trees\nbased on the presence and absence of genes, genome\ntrees based on chromosomal gene order, genome trees\nbased on average sequence similarity, and phylogenomic\ntrees based either on the collection of phylogenetic trees\nderived from shared gene families or on a concatenated\nalignment of those families. Due to the problems caused\nby the uncertainty in alignment [29], existing tools for\nphylogenetic analysis based on multiple alignment could\nnot be directly applied to the whole-genome comparison\nand phylogenomic studies. There has been a growing\ninterest in alignment-free methods for phylogenetic anal-\nysis using complete genome data [2,30,31]. Recently Jun\net al [32] used an alignment-free method, the feature fre-\nquency profiles of whole proteomes, to construct a\nwhole-proteome phylogeny of 884 prokaryotes and 16\nunicellular eukaryotes. In their whole-proteome trees,\nArchaea, Eubacteria and Eukarya are clearly separated.\nSimilarly, the analyses based on dynamical language (DL)\nmodel [33] and Markov model [34] without sequence\nalignment using 103 prokaryotes and six eukaryotes have\nyielded trees separating the three domains of life with the\nrelationships among the taxa consistent with those based\non traditional analyses. These two methods were also\nused to analyze the complete chloroplast genomes\n[33,35]. The CV Tree method [34] was recently used to\nanalyze the fungal phylogeny [36]. A simplified version\nbased on the CV T ree method was used to analyze gene\nsequencesfor the purpose of DNA barcoding [37,38].\nZheng et al [39] proposed a complexity-based measure\nfor phylogenetic analysis. Guyon et al [40] compared four\nalignment-free string distances for complete genome\nphylogeny using 62 α-proteobacteria. The four distances\nare Maximum Significant Matches (MSM) distance, K-\nword (KW) or K-mer distance (i.e. the CV Tree method\n[33]), Average Common Substring (ACS) distance and\nCompression (ZL) distance. The results showed that the\nMSM distance outperforms the other three distances and\nthe CV Tree method cannot give good phylogenetic\ntopology for the 62 α-proteobacteria. We recently modi-\nfied our dynamical language (DL) method [33] by replac-\ning the correlation distance (pseudo-distance) by the\nchord distance (a proper distance in the strict mathemat-\nical sense) and proposed a way to select the optimal fea-\nture length based on average relative difference analysis\n[41]. Testing the modified DL method on the data sets\nused in previous studies [33,34,40], we found that this\nmethod can give very good phylogenetic topologies [41],\nwhile the CV tree method cannot give good phylogenetic\ntopology for the 62 α-proteobacteria [40]. In the present\npaper, we adopt the DL method [33] to analyze a large\nnumber of genomes of the large dsDNA viruses and par-\nvoviruses.\nGenome Data Sets\nIn order to explore the feasibility of our method, the\nwhole DNA sequences (including protein-coding and\nnon-coding regions), all protein-coding DNA sequences\nand all protein sequences from the complete genomes of\nthe following two data sets were obtained from the NCBI\ngenome database http://www .ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/\ngenomes.\nData set 1 (used in [1])\nWe selected 124 large dsDNA viruses.

The trees of K = 3 to\n6 based on all protein sequences and the trees of K ≤ 13\nbased on the whole DNA sequences and all protein-cod-\ning DNA sequences using the DL method [33] were con-\nstructed. After comparing all the trees constructed by the\npresent method with the classification of the 124 large\ndsDNA viruses and 30 parvoviruses given in the VIIIth\nR e p o r t  o f  I C T V  [ 2 3 ] ,  w e  f o u n d  t h a t  t h e  t r e e s  f o r  l a r g e\ndsDNA viruses and parvoviruses based on all protein\nsequences are better than those based on all protein-cod-\ning DNA sequences and the whole DNA sequences. Fur-\nthermore, for the phylogenetic trees of 124 large dsDNA\nviruses based on all protein sequences, the tree of K = 5\nprovides the best result among the cases of K = 3 to 6. We\nshow this tree in Figure 1. The trees for K = 4 and 6 are\nsimilar to but a little bit inferior to the tree for K = 5. The\nbootstrap consensus trees for the four big groups (Aden-\noviridae, Baculoviridae, Herpesviridae and Poxviridae)\n(Figure 2) provide branch statistics for the tree in Figure\n1. For the trees of 30 parvoviruses based on all protein\nsequences, the trees for K = 4 and 6 are topologically\nidentical, and are the best trees among the cases of K = 3\nto 6. We show the tree for K = 4 in Figure 3. The tree for K\n= 5 is similar to but a little bit worse than the trees for K =\nYu et al.

The distance matrices generated from our anal-\nyses are available from the first author via email \nyuzg1970@yahoo.com\n. We found that the DL method [33] and the modified DL\nmethod [41] give trees of the same topology for the same\nK for both data sets.\nAs given in Figure 1, despite numerous horizontal gene\ntransfers among large dsDNA viruses [9], our analysis can\ndivide the 124 dsDNA viruses into nine families correctly.\nOur phylogenetic relationships of all 124 large dsDNA\nviruses are in good agreement with the latest classifica-\ntion in the VIIIth Report of the International Committee\non Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) [20]. In the family Aden-\noviridae, Figures 1 and 2a support the division of this\nf a m i l y  i n t o  f o u r  g e n e r a  Atadenovirus, Aviadenovirus,\nMastadenovirus and Siadenovirus. All viruses in these\nfour genera are grouped correctly. The topology of phy-\nlogeny for these four genera is identical to that shown in\nFigure one of [1] which supports the hypothesis that\ninterspecies transmission, i.e. host switches of adenovi-\nruses, may have occurred [42]. In Figures 1 and 2b, the\nfamily Baculoviridae is divided into two genera Granulo-\nvirus and Nucleopolyhedrovirus. All viruses in these two\ngenera are classified correctly. The unclassified virus\nN e l e N P V  i n  t h i s  f a m i l y  g r o u p s  w i t h  N e s e N P V  w h i c h\nbelongs to genus Nucleopolyhedrovirus. So our result\nsupports grouping virus NeleNPV to genus Nucleopoly-\nhedrovirus. Another unclassified virus CuniNPV is\nlocated at the basal position of this family, as reported by\nFigure 1 The NJ tree of 124 large dsDNA virus genomes based on the all protein sequences using the DL method for K = 5.\n\nYu et al.

Thus the classifi-\ncation of CuniNPV is still unresolved in our analysis. The\ndivision of the family Poxviridae into two subfamilies\nChordopoxvirinae and Entomopoxvirinae shown in Fig-\nures 1 and 2d is the same as in the VIIIth Report of ICTV.\nIn the subfamily Chordopoxvirinae, the viruses in the\ngenera Avipoxvirus, Capripoxvirus, Leporipoxvirus, Mol-\nluscipoxvirus, Orthopoxvirus, Parapoxvirus, Suipoxvirus\nand Yatapoxvirus group together correctly. The unclassi-\nfied virus DPV is closely related to the genera Capripox-\nvirus and Suipoxvirus, so that our result supports\nassigning the virus DPV to the subfamily Chordopoxviri-\nnae, in agreement with the results in [1] and [45]. In the\nsubfamily Entomopoxvirinae, the viruses in genus\nBetaentomopoxvirus group together as expected. The\ndivision of the family Herpesviridae into subfamilies\nAlphaherpesvirinae, Gammaherpesvirinae and Betaher-\npesvirinae is clear. All viruses in the genera within each\nsubfamily are grouped correctly in Figures 1 and 2c. Con-\nsistent with the result of [1], our tree supports assigning\nthe unclassified virus TuHV_1 in the subfamily Betaher-\npesvirinae to genus Cytomegalovirus. The unclassified\nHerpesviridae virus OsHV_1 groups with IcHV_1 indi-\ncating that we can assign it to the genus Ictalurivirus. The\nunclassified Herpesviridae virus PsHV_1 groups with\nGaHV_1, suggesting its affiliation to the genus Iltovirus.\nThe unclassified Herpesviridae virus AtHV_3 nests\ninside the branch of genus Rhadinovirus, which indicates\nwe can assign it to the genus Rhadinovirus. All viruses in\nthe family Iridoviridae fall into their genera correctly in\nF i gu r e  1 .  T h e  gr o u p i n g o f  t h e  u n c las si fi ed  vi rus  H ZV _ 1\nwith WSSV indicates its affiliation to the genus Whispo-\nvirus in the family Nimaviridae. The viruses in family\nPhycodnaviridae group together as expected. The virus\nAPMiV of the genus Mimivirus but with no family affilia-\ntion nests within the family Phycodnaviridae suggests\nclassification of the genus to this family. The viruses in\nthe family Polydnaviridae cluster together correctly. As\nclaimed by Gao and Qi [1], our results could also provide\nsome clues to the hypotheses on the origins and evolution\nof viruses of several families. Overall, the topology of our\ntree is similar to that of the tree in [1] and our tree is\nslightly better because the tree in [1]has 4 outliers (Cun-\niNPV, IIV_6, IcHV_1 and OsHV_1) while ours has no out-\nlier. Although the results using feature frequency profiles\nFigure 3 The NJ tree of 30 parvovirus genomes based on the all \nprotein sequences using the modified DL method for K = 4.\nFigure 4 The bootstrap consensus trees for Figure 3 based on 100 \nreplicates.

In the Parvovirinae group, the\nparvoviruses in the genera Parvovirus, Erythrovirus,\nDependovirus, Amdovirus and Bocavirus group together\nas subgroups respectively. In the Densovirinae group, the\nparvoviruses in the genera Densovirus, Iteravirus and\nBrevidensovirus cluster together as subgroups correctly.\nAll the groups and subgroups shown in Figure 3 using our\nmethod agree well with the latest classification of parvo-\nv i r u s e s  g i v e n  i n  t h e  V I I I t h  R e p o r t  o f  I C T V  [ 2 0 ]  e x c e p t\nPfDNV. PfDNV was classified into the Brevidensovirus in\nthe VIIth Report of the ICTV [23] and reclassified into\nPefudensovirus in the VIIIth Report of ICTV [20]. After\nthe comparison on the genome structure, coding protein\nsequence homology, DNA sequence homology, 3-dimen-\nsional structure [46,47] between PfDNV and other parvo-\nv i r u s e s ,  L i  e t  a l  [ 4 8 ]  c l a i m e d  t h a t  i t  w o u l d  b e  m o r e\nappropriate to classify pfDNV as Densovirus rather than\nBrevidensovirus. Thus the grouping of PfDNV with Dens-\noviru in our tree (Figures 3 and 4) provides another piece\nof evidence for classifying PfDNV as Densovirus.\nAmdovirus and Bocavirus are newly defined genera in the\nsubfamily Parvoririnae in the VIIIth Report of ICTV [20].\nIn the VIIth Report of ICTV [23], the parvoviruses\n(AMDV and MVC) in these two new genera were\ngrouped under Parvovirus. Their close relationship is also\nreflected in our trees (Figures 3 and 4) in which Amdovi-\nrus and Bocavirus cluster with Parvovirus as a separate\nbranch. The parvoviruses AAV7, AAV8, AAAVa, BPV2,\nMPV, AdDNV and CeDNV are still not classified in the\nVIIIth Report of ICTV [20]. In our previous study [33],\nthe DL method applied to the analysis of 103 prokaryotes\nand six eukaryotes has yielded trees separating the three\ndomains of life, Archaea, Eubacteria and Eukarya with\nthe relationships among the taxa in good agreement with\nthose based on traditional analyses. It has also been\napplied in analyzing the chloroplast genomes [33] to give\nreliable phylogenies of plants and algae. From the above\ndiscussion, it is clear that this method can successfully\nresolve the phylogeny of parvoviruses. The positions of\nAAV7, AAV8, AAAVa, BPV2, MPV, AdDNV and CeDNV\nin Figure 3 provide new insights on their classification.\nIt is very interesting to note the assumption that small\nDNA viruses (genome size <10 kb) probably have differ-\nent evolutionary history as compared to large DNA\nviruses [9,49]. Our analyses showed that the DL method\ncan be used to reconstruct the phylogeny of viruses with\nlarge difference in genome size (larger than 10 kb for\nlarge dsDNA viruses and less than 10 kb for parvovi-\nruses). We also generated all the trees of the same K val-\nues based on the three kinds of sequences for the\nparvovirus data set 2 using the CV Tree method [34]. Yet\nno tree generated by the CV Tree method can clearly dis-\ntinguish the subfamilies Parvovirinae and Densovirinae\nof parvoviruses. So for the data set of parvoviruses, the\nDL method is superior (from the biological point of view)\nto the CV Tree method in phylogenetic inference.\nOur approach is faster than the traditional approaches\nof phylogenetic analysis, particularly when dealing with a\nlarge number of genomes. Moreover, since multiple\nsequence alignment is not necessary, the intrinsic prob-\nl e m s  a s s o c i a t e d  w i t h  t h i s  c o m p l e x  p r o c e d u r e  c a n  b e\navoided. Our method may provide a quick reference on\nvirus phylogeny and a fast analysis of co-evolution of\nviruses and their hosts when their proteomes are avail-\nable [1,50].\nConclusions\nUsing the DL method, we have studied the molecular\nphylogeny between families of large dsDNA viruses and\nparvoviruses. The present method provides a new way\nfor recovering the phylogeny of large dsDNA viruses and\nparvoviruses, and also insights on the affiliation of some\nunclassified viruses and relationships among some fami-\nlies. It appears that some alignment-free methods such as\nthe CV T ree method [34] can be used for recovering the\nphylogeny of large dsDNA viruses, but they are not suit-\nable for parvoviruses with a much smaller genome size.\nMethods\nI n  t h i s  p a p e r ,  t h r e e  k i n d s  o f  d a t a  f r o m  t h e  c o m p l e t e\ngenomes of large dsDNA viruses and parvoviruses are\na n a l y s e d  u s i n g  t h e  D L  m e t h o d  p r o p o s e d  b y  o u r  g r o u p\n[33]. They are the whole DNA sequences (including pro-\ntein-coding and non-coding regions), all protein-coding\nDNA sequences and the amino acid sequences of all pro-\ntein-coding genes.\nThere are a total of N = 4\nK(for DNA sequences) or\n20K(for protein sequences) possible types of K-mers (the\nstrings with fixed length K). We denote the length of a\nDNA or protein sequence as L. Then a window of length\nK is used to slide through the sequences by shifting one\nposition at a time to determine the frequencies of each of\nthe N kinds of K-mers in this sequence. We define\np(α\n1α2...αK) = n(α1α2...αK)/(L - K + 1) as the observed fre-\nquency of a K-mer α1α2...αK, where n(α1α2...αK) is the\nnumber of times that α1α2...αK appears in this sequence.\nFor the DNA or amino acid sequences of the protein-cod-\nYu et al.

Then we can form a composition vector for a\ngenome using p(α1α2...αK) as components for all possible\nK-mers α1α2...αK. We use pi to denote the i-th component\ncorresponding to the mer type i, i = 1,..., N (N mers are\narranged in a fixed order as the alphabetical order). In\nthis way we construct a composition vector p = (p\n1, p2,...,\npN) for a genome.\nY u  e t  a l  [ 3 3 ]  c o n s i d e r e d  a n  i d e a  f r o m  t h e  t h e o r y  o f\ndynamical language that a K-mer s1s2...sK is possibly con-\nstructed by adding a letter sK to the end of the (K-1) -mer\ns1s2...sK-1or a letter s1 to the beginning of the ( K-1)-mer\ns2s3...sK. After counting the observed frequencies for all\n(K-1)-mers and the four or 20 kinds of letters, the\nexpected frequency of appearance of K-mers is predicted\nby\nwhere p(s1) and p(sK)are frequencies of nucleotides or\namino acids s1and sK appearing in this genome. Then\nq(s1s2...sK) of all 4 K or 20 KK-mers is viewed as the noise\nbackground. We then subtract the noise background by\ndefining\nThe transformation X = (p/q)-1 has the desired effect of\nsubtraction of random background in p and rendering it a\nstationary time series suitable for subsequent cross-cor-\nrelation analysis. X can also be regarded as the relative\ndifference between p and q.\nThen we use X(s\n1s2...sK) for all possible K-mers s1s2...sK\nas components and arrange them according to a fixed\nalphabetical order to form a composition vector X =\n(X1,X2,...,XN) for genome X, and likewise Y = (Y1,Y2,...,YN)\nfor genome Y.\nThen we view the N components in the vectors X and Y\nas samples of these two random variables respectively.\nThe sample correlation C(X, Y) between any two\ngenomes X and Yis defined in the usual way. The dissimi-\nlarity D(X, Y ) between the two genomes is then defined\nby D(X, Y) = (1 - C(X, Y))/2. A dissimilarity matrix for all\nthe genomes under study is then generated for the con-\nstruction of phylogenetic trees. This method to construct\nphylogenetic tree is referred to as the dynamical language\n(DL) method [33].\nFinally, for convenience to compare the results with\nthose of the previous works, based on the distance matri-\nces, we construct all trees for data sets 1 and 2 using the\nneighbour-joining (NJ) method [51] in the softwares\nPhylip [52] (version 3.66) and SplitsTree4 [51] (version\n4.10).\nRobustness test of the trees using modified version of the \nbootstrap method [2]\nIn order to estimate the robustness of tree topology, Qi et\na l  [ 3 4 ]  p r o p o s e d  a  b o o t s t r a p  m e t h o d  b y  r e s a m p l i n g  o n\nthe genes or translated proteins on the genome (this\nmet hod was also used by  W ang et al [36]). W u et al [2]\nproposed a modified bootstrap method by resampling the\nfrequencies of all K-mers. The method of Qi et al. [34] is\nnot applicable to the virus genomes as almost all virus\ngenomes have only a few genes and it is statistically\nmeaningless to resample such a small number of genes.\nSo we use the modified bootstrap method proposed by\nWu et al [2] which works as follows. A table is first con-\nstructed with each row being the composition vector rep-\nresenting a genome and each column representing the\nfrequencies of a fixed K-mer in different genomes. The\nbootstrap is applied to the columns of the table except\nthose are redrawn [2]. Thus, the resampled table has\nfewer columns but each K-mer maintains the same fre-\nquency as in the original table. Because it is allowed that\nsome positions could be redrawn more than once in the\ntraditional bootstrap analyses with sequence alignment\n[53], we believe it is more reasonable to allow that some\ncolumns to be redrawn more than once, giving the resam-\npled table with the same number of columns as the origi-\nnal table in the modified bootstrap method. Then a\ndistance matrix can be obtained based on the resampled\ntable.\nAuthors' contributions\nZGY conceived the study, downloaded the data, analyzed the results, and was\ninvolved in programming, drafting and revising the manuscript.
