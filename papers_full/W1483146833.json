MAJOU ET AL. \n2. ABOUT PARALLEL KINEMATIC MACHINES \n2.1. General Remarks \nThe first industrial application of PKMs was the Gough platform (Figure 1), \ndesigned in 1957 to test tyres 1. PKMs have then been used for many years in flight \nsimulators and robotic applications2 because of their low moving mass and high dynamic \nperformances. Since the development of high speed machining, PKMTs have become \ninteresting alternative machine tool designs3, 4. \n \nFigure 1. The Gough platform \nIn a PKM, the tool is connected to the base  through several kinematic chains or legs \nthat are mounted in parallel. The legs are generally made of either telescopic struts with \nfixed node points (Figure 2a), or fixed length struts with gliding node points (Figure 2b). \n \nFigure 2a. A bipod PKM Figure 2b. A biglide PKM \n2.2. Singularities \nThe singular configurations (also called si ngularities) of a PKM may appear inside \nthe workspace or at its boundaries. There are two types of singularities 5. A configuration \nwhere a finite tool velocity requires infinite  joint rates is called a serial singularity. A \nconfiguration where the tool cannot resist any effort and in turn, becomes uncontrollable, \nis called a parallel singularity. Parallel singul arities are particularly undesirable because \nthey induce the following problems: \n- a high increase in forces in joints and links, that may damage the structure,  \n- a decrease of the mechanism stiffness that  can lead to uncontrolled motions of the \ntool though actuated joints are locked. \nTHE DESIGN OF PKMT USING KINETOSTATIC PERFORMANCE CRITERIA 3 \n \nFigures 3a and 3b show the singularities for the biglide mechanism of Fig. 2b. In \nFig. 3a, we have a serial singularity. The velocity amplification factor along the vertical \ndirection is null and the force amplification factor is infinite. \nFigure 3b shows a parallel singularity. The ve locity amplification factor is infinite \nalong the vertical direction and the force amplif ication factor is close to zero. Note that a \nhigh velocity amplification factor is not necessarily desirable because the actuator \nencoder resolution is amplified and thus the accuracy is lower. \nP\n \n \nP\nFigure 3a. A serial singularity Figure 3b. A parallel singularity \n2.3. Working and Assembly Modes \nA serial (resp. parallel) singularity is a ssociated with a change of working mode 6 \n(resp. of assembly mode). For example, the biglide has four possible working modes for \na given tool position (each leg node point can be to the left or to the right of the \nintermediate position corresponding to the serial singularity, Fig. 4a) and two assembly \nmodes for a given actuator joint input (the tool is above or below the horizontal line \ncorresponding to the parallel singularity, Fig. 4b). The choice of the assembly mode and \nof the working mode may influence significantly the behaviour of the mechanism\n5. \nP\n \nP\nP'\n \nFigure 4a. The four working modes Figure 4b. The two assembly modes \n3. PKMs AS ALTERNATIVE MACHINE TOOL DESIGNS \n3.1. Limitations of Serial Machine Tools  \nToday, newly designed machine tools benefit from technological improvements of \ncomponents such as spindles, linear actuators, bearings. Most machine tools are based on \na serial architecture (Figure 5), whose advantage is that input/output relations are simple. \n4   F. MAJOU ET AL. \nNevertheless, heavy masses to be carried and moved by each axis limit the dynamic \nperformances, like feed rates or accelerations. That is wh y machine tools manufacturers \nhave started being interested into PKMs since 1990. \nX\nZ\nY\n \nFigure 5. A serial PPP machine tool \n3.2. PKMs Potentialities for Machine Tool Design \nThe low moving mass of PKMs and their good stiffness allow high feed rates (up to \n100 m/min) and accelerations (f rom 1 to 5g), which are the performances required by \nHigh Speed Machining.  \nPKMs are said to be very accurate, which is not true in every case 4, but another \nadvantage is that the struts only work in traction or compression. However, there are \nmany structural differences between serial and parallel machine tools, which makes it \nhard to strictly compare their performances.  \n3.3. Problems with PKMs \na) The workspace of a PKM has not a simp le geometric shape, and its functional \nvolume is reduced, compared to th e space occupied by the machine 7, as we can see on \nFig. 6. \n \nFigure 6. Workspace sections of Tricept 805 (www.neosrobotics.com) \nb) For a serial mechanism, the velocity a nd force transmission ratios are constant in \nthe workspace. For a parallel m echanism, in contrast, these ratios may vary significantly \nin the workspace because the di splacement of the tool is not linearly related to the \ndisplacement of the actuators. In some part s of the workspace, the maximal velocities \nand forces measured at the tool may differ significantly from the maximal velocities and \nforces that the actuators can produce. This is particularly true in the vicinity of \nTHE DESIGN OF PKMT USING KINETOSTATIC PERFORMANCE CRITERIA 5 \n \nsingularities. At a singularity, the veloci ty, accuracy and force ratios reach extreme \nvalues. \nc) Calibration of PKMs is quite comp licated because of kinematic models \ncomplexity8. \n4. EXISTING PKMT DESIGNS \nIn this section will be presented some existing PKMTs. \n4.1. Fully Parallel Machine Tools \nWhat we call fully parallel machine tools ar e PKMs that have as many degrees of \nfreedom as struts. On Fig. 7, we can see a 3- RPR fully parallel mechanism with three \nstruts. Each strut is made of a revolute joint, a prismatic actuated joint and a revolute \njoint. \n \nFigure 7. 3-RPR fully parallel mechanism \nFully PKMT with six variable length st ruts are called hexapods. Hexapods are \ninspired by the Gough Platform. The first PKMT was the hexapod “Variax” from \nGiddings and Lewis presented in 1994 at the IMTS in Chicago. Hexapods have six \ndegrees of freedom. One more recent example is the CMW300, a hexapod head designed \nby the Compagnie Mécanique des Vosges (Figure 8). \n \nFigure 8. Hexapod CMW 300 (perso.wanadoo.fr/cmw.meca.6x/6AXES.htm) \n6   F. MAJOU ET AL. \nFully parallel machine tools with fixed length struts can have three, four or six legs. \nThe Urane SX (Figures 9 and 14) from Rena ult Automation is a three leg machine, \nwhose tool can only move along X, Y and Z axes, and its architecture is inspired from \nthe Delta robot9, designed for pick and place applications. The Hexa M from Toyoda is a \nPKMT with six fixed length struts (Figure 10).  \n \n  \nFigure 9.  Renault automation Urane SX (from “Renault \nAutomation Magazine”, n° 21, may 1999) \nFigure 10.  Toyoda Hexa M (www.toyoda-\nkouki.co.jp) \n4.2. Other Kinds of PKMT \nThe Tricept 805 is a widely used PKMT with three variable length struts (Figures 6 \nand 11). The Tricept 805 has a hybrid arch itecture: a two degrees of freedom wrist \nserially mounted on a tripod architecture.  \nAnother non fully parallel MT is the Ec lipse (Figure 12) from Sena Technology 10, 11. \nThe Eclipse is an overactuated PKM for rapid machining, capable of simultaneous five \nfaces milling, as well as turning, thanks to the second spindle. \n \n \n \nFigure 11.

The Eclipse, from Sena Technology \n(macea.snu.ac.kr/eclipse/homepage.html) \nTHE DESIGN OF PKMT USING KINETOSTATIC PERFORMANCE CRITERIA 7 \n \n5. DESIGNING A PKMT \n5.1. A Global Task \nGiven a set of needs, the most adequate machine will be designed through a set of \ndesign parameters like the machine morphology (serial, parallel or hybrid kinematic \nstructure), the machine geometry (link dimensions, joint orientation and joint ranges), the \ntype of actuators (linear or rotative motor), the type of joints (prismatic or revolute), the \nnumber and the type of degrees of freedom, the task for which the machine is designed. \nThese parameters must be defined using relevant design criteria.  \n5.2. Kinetostatic Performance Criteria are Adequate for the Design of PKMTs  \nThe only way to cope with problems due to singularities is to integrate kinetostatic \nperformance criteria in the design process of  a PKMT. Kinetostatic performance criteria \nevaluate the ability of a mechanism to transmit forces or velocities from the actuators to \nthe tool. These kinetostatic performance criteria must be able to guaranty minimum \nstiffness, accuracy and velocity performan ces along every direction throughout  the \nworkspace of the PKMT.  \nTo reach this goal, we us e two complementary criteria:  the conditioning of the \nJacobian matrix J of the PKMT, called conditioning index, and the manipulability \nellipsoid associated with J\n12. The Jacobian matrix J relates the joint rates to the tool \nvelocities. It also relates the static tool efforts to the actuator efforts. The conditioning \nindex is defined as the ratio between the highest and the smallest eigenvalue of J. The \nconditioning index varies from 1 to infinity. At a singularity, the index is infinity. It is 1 \nat another special configuration called isotropic configuration. At this configuration, the \ntool velocity and stiffness are equal in all directions. The conditioning index measures \nthe uniformity of the distribution of the velocities and efforts around one given \nconfiguration but it does not inform about the magnitude of the velocity amplification or \neffort factors. \nThe manipulability ellipsoid is defined from the matrix ( J J\nT)-1. The principal axes of \nthe ellipsoid are defined by the eigenvectors of ( J JT)-1 and the lengths of the principal \naxes are the square roots of the eigenvalues of ( J JT)-1. The eigenvalues are associated \nwith the velocity (or force) amplificati on factors along the principal axes of the \nmanipulability ellipsoid.  \nThese criteria are used in Wenger 13, to optimize the workspace shape and the \nperformances uniformity of the Orthoglide, a three degree of freedom PKM dedicated to \nmilling applications (Figure 13). \n8   F. MAJOU ET AL. \n \nFigure 13. A section of Orthoglide’s optimised workspace \n5.3. Technical Problems \nIf the struts of the PKMT are made with  ballscrews, the PKMT accuracy may suffer \nfrom struts warping due to heating caused by  frictions generated by ballscrews. This \nproblem is met by hexapods designers that use ballscrews. Thus, besides manufacturing \ninaccuracies, the calibration of  a PKMT will have to take  into account dimensions \nvariations due to dilatation. A good thermal evacuation can minimise the effects of \nheating.  \nIn case PKMT actuators are linear actuators, magnetic pollution has to be taken into \naccount so that chips clearing out is not ob structed. One technique, used by Renault \nAutomation for the Urane SX, is to isolate the tool from the mechanism (Figure 14). \n \nFigure 14. Urane SX tool is isolated from the mechanism that generates the motion (from “Renault Automation \nMagazine”, n° 21, may 1999) \nAt last, choosing fixed length or variable length struts influence the behaviour of the \nmachine. Actuators have to be mounted on the struts in case of variable length struts, \nwhich increases moved masses. Fixed length struts do not have this problem, and \nfurthermore allow the use of linear actuators, that bring high dynamic performances. \n6. THE ORTHOGLIDE \nA three-axis PKMT, the Orthoglide, was designed at IRCCyN Using the two \nkinetostatic criteria given in section 5.2. A small-scale prototype is under development \n(Figure 15).  \nTHE DESIGN OF PKMT USING KINETOSTATIC PERFORMANCE CRITERIA 9 \n \n \nFigure 15. PKMT prototype \nThe theoretical kinematic analysis of the Orthoglide is described in Wenger 13. The \nOrthoglide has been designed such that it has an isotropic configuration (the velocity and \nforces transmission factors are equal in eac h direction) in its workspace. Moreover the \nvelocity  and force transmission factors remain under prescribed values throughout the \nworkspace. The paper describes how the kinetostatic criteria have been used to define the \nOrthoglide kinematics  and geometry for machine tool applications (Figure 16).  \nThe dimensions of the Orthoglide have been chosen for a 200*200*200 prescribed \ncartesian workspace, so that the velocity an d force amplification factors remain between \n0.6 and 1.7, which guarantees minimum performances inside the available workspace. \nJoint ranges have also been optimised to respect the limits chosen for the velocity and \nforce transmission factors (Figure 17).  \nOne or two degrees of freedoms can be added to the Orthoglide either by: \n- mounting serially a one or two degree of freedom wrist, or \n- mounting an orienting branch on the base of the Orthoglide, leading to a left hand / \nright hand architecture. \n \n \n350 mm 240 mm\n200 mm\n \nFigure 16.

CONCLUSIONS \nThe aim of this article was to introduce a few criteria for the design of PKMTs, which \nmay become interesting alternatives for High Speed Machining, especially in the milling \nof large parts made of hard material, or for serial manufacturing operations on \naeronautical parts. \nKinetostatic criteria seem to be well adapted to the design of PKMTs, particularly for \nthe kinematic design and for the optimisati on of the workspace shape, with regard to \nperformances uniformity. \nThe kinetostatic criteria have been used for the design of the Orth oglide, a three-axis \nPKMT developed at IRCCyN. A small scale prototype is under development. A five-axis \nPKMT will be derived from the Orthoglide. \nREFERENCES \n1. Gough V.
