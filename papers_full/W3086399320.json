Here, we review DSTs applied in the Baltic Sea area, to investigate how well the ecosystem approach is reﬂected in\nthem, how different environmental problems are covered, and how well the tools meet the needs of the end users. The DSTs\nwere evaluated based on (i) a set of performance criteria, (ii) information on end user preferences, (iii) how end users had\nbeen involved in tool development, and (iv) what experiences developers/hosts had on the use of the tools. We found that\nDSTs frequently addressed management needs related to eutrophication, biodiversity loss, or contaminant pollution. The\nmajority of the DSTs addressed human activities, their pressures, or environmental status changes, but they seldom provided\nsolutions for a complete ecosystem approach. In general, the DSTs were scientiﬁcally documented and transparent, but\nconﬁdence in the outputs was poorly communicated. End user preferences were, apart from the shortcomings in\ncommunicating uncertainty, well accounted for in the DSTs. Although end users were commonly consulted during the DST\ndevelopment phase, they were not usually part of the development team. Answers from developers/hosts indicate that DSTs\nare not applied to their full potential. Deeper involvement of end users in the development phase could potentially increase\nthe value and impact of DSTs. As a way forward, we propose streamlining the outputs of speciﬁc DSTs, so that they can be\ncombined to a holistic insight of the consequences of management actions and serve the ecosystem approach in a better\nmanner.\nKeywords Marine management\n●\nDecision-making\n●\nEcosystem approach\n●\nDAPSIWRM\n●\nBaltic Sea\nIntroduction\nCoastal and marine ecosystems around the globe provide a\nrange of services supporting the social and economic well-\nbeing of communities (Turner and Schaafsma2015). The\nincreasing use of marine resources leads to growing pres-\nsures and impacts on the marine environment, compro-\nmising the sustainable provisioning of ecosystem services\n(Airoldi and Beck2007). In addition to sea-based activities,\nactivities on land, e.g., agriculture and industry, also alter\nthe condition of the marine environment through enhanced\nnutrient and pollutant runoff (HELCOM2018a). Managing\nthe use of resources, while sustaining ecological integrity, is\na key challenge in marine environment management. This\nhas led to the development of ecosystem-based manage-\nment, striving to ensure that marine ecosystems are well\nfunctioning and able to support sustainable delivery of\necosystem goods and services (Elliott 2011; Borja et al.\n2016).\n* Henrik Nygård\nhenrik.nygard@ymparisto.ﬁ\n1 Marine Research Centre, Finnish Environment Institute,\nHelsinki, Finland\n2 Department of Bioscience, Aarhus University, Roskilde, Denmark\n3 Baltic Sea Centre, Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden\n4 Tvärminne Zoological Station, University of Helsinki,\nHanko, Finland\n5 Department of Environmental Science, Aarhus University,\nRoskilde, Denmark\n6 Leibniz Institute for Baltic Sea Research Warnemünde,\nRostock, Germany\n7 Marine Research Institute, Klaipeda University,\nKlaipeda, Lithuania\nSupplementary InformationThe online version of this article\n(https://doi.org/10.1007/s00267-020-01356-8) contains supplementary\nmaterial, which is available to authorized users.\n1234567890();,:\n1234567890();,:\nThe DAPSI(W)R(M) concept (Elliott et al.2017), later in\nthis paper referred to as DAPSIWRM, provides a general\nstructuring and holistic framework for use in environmental\nmanagement. The concept has evolved over many years,\nrooting back to the PSR framework that was proposed by\nRapport and Friend ( 1979), further adapted by several\ninternational organizations (OECD1993; EPA1994; UNEP\n1994) and expanded to DPSIR (EEA1999), before stepwise\ntransforming into its current format (Elliott et al.2017).\nThe DAPSIWRM concept describes links and interac-\ntions between drivers (deﬁning the needs), activities (human\nactivities to ﬁll the needs), pressures (caused by the activ-\nities), state changes (how the pressures affect the environ-\nment), impacts on welfare (how society is impacted), and\nresponse using measures (management actions). The ability\nof the DAPSIWRM framework to link natural and societal\ninformation facilitates integrated marine management while\nincorporating the ecosystem approach (Elliott et al.2017).\nEcosystem-based management relies on information of\nvarious components from the marine environment and on\nthe sources and magnitude of pressures that impact marine\necosystem services. Consequently, vast amounts of infor-\nmation need to be synthesized to make well-informed\ndecisions (Elliott 2013; Scharin et al.2016).\nDecision-support tools (DSTs) combine, process and\ncondense large amounts of information, assisting the man-\nager in the decision-making process. Decision makers at\nlocal, national, and intergovernmental level need this\ninformation to, for example, evaluate the current status of\nthe marine environment, and estimate the most cost-efﬁcient\nmeasures that are needed to restore impaired status (Balana\net al. 2011) or to facilitate spatial planning (e.g., Bagstad\net al. 2013, Stelzenmüller et al. 2013). DSTs allow a\nstructured process where alternative options can be com-\npared, improving the transparency of the decision-making\nprocess (Nicholson et al.2020; Sullivan2004; Ward2007).\nTechnically, DSTs are expected to produce outcomes, as\nrealistic as possible, that answer a speciﬁc set of questions;\nfor the eutrophication problem, as an example, questions\nsuch as: what is the eutrophication status of a sea area? How\nmuch nutrient pressure can it tolerate? What are the beneﬁts\nof nutrient abatement? What are the most cost-ef ﬁcient\nmanagement actions?\nThe marine environment is protected by a large number\nof international and national legislation and policies (Boyes\nand Elliott 2014; Reusch et al. 2018). In the Baltic Sea,\nenvironmental problems and subsequent socio-economic\nimpacts are addressed through regional, European and\nglobal policies and agreements, directed toward sustainable\nmanagement of the Baltic Sea. The HELCOM Baltic Sea\nAction Plan (BSAP) is an example of an international\nregional agreement. On the European level, many envir-\nonmental EU directives (Marine Strategy Framework\nDirective (MSFD), Water Framework Directive (WFD),\nHabitats Directive, Waste Framework Directive, Maritime\nSpatial Planning Directive) as well as sectoral policies (e.g.,\nIntegrated Maritime Policy, Common Fisheries Policy,\nCommon Agricultural Policy) and strategies (Strategy on\nAdaptation to Climate Change, Biodiversity Strategy) exist.\nThe implementation of these initiatives challenges the\ncoastal states, that strive, both individually and collectively,\nto assess the potential outcomes of choices and decisions\nregarding the management of human actions and their\nimpact on the environment. These decisions are guided by\nthe policy requirements but they need to be based onﬁrst-\nhand information from the environment and the society.\nThis is where DSTs are essential. The DSTs developed and\napplied in the Baltic Sea and its drainage basin range from\nquantitative assessment tools to model-based or operational\nsystems linked to databases, but also include tools that\nhandle more descriptive, nonquantitative information.\nHere, we provide an overview of DSTs developed for\napplication in environmental management of the Baltic Sea\nand its drainage area. First, we made an inventory, where\nthe DSTs are categorized according to the DAPSIWRM\nframework and the environmental problems they address.\nParticularly, the role of the DSTs within the DAPSIWRM\ncontext, in terms of how well its components and linkages\nare covered, was investigated. Second, we developed a\nframework to assess DST performance and to understand\ntheir strengths and weaknesses. Third, we assessed the\nDSTs against the end user needs. Finally, we investigated\nthe development and maintenance of the DSTs, addressing\nquestions such as how end users had been involved in the\ntool development and how well the sustainability of the\nDSTs were ensured.\nMaterial and Methods\nDeﬁnition of DST\nDSTs can be deﬁned very broadly to include any tool that\ncondenses complex information into an easier under-\nstandable format to be applied in decision-making (Sullivan\n2004). Such tools include, for example quantitative\nassessment tools, model-based management tools and\noperational systems linked to databases. To structure our\noverview and to have a common understanding of the term\n“DST”, with focus on marine environmental management in\nthe Baltic Sea, a deﬁnition for use in the BONUS DEST-\nONY project\n1 was elaborated and a set ofﬁve deﬁnition\ncriteria (DC) were formulated (Table1). Ideally, a DEST-\nONY DST should fulﬁll all these criteria, but in practice,\n1 https://www.bonusportal.org/projects/synthesis_2018-2020/destony\nEnvironmental Management (2020) 66:1024–1038 1025\nthey turned out to be very demanding. To include a broader\nrange of DSTs in the inventory, fulﬁlling all DC was not\nconsidered as a requirement. However, this implies that we\ndo not cover all tools (e.g., models) fulﬁlling few of the DC.\nIn the performance analyses, we included only DSTs ful-\nﬁlling more than four of the DC, to ensure comparability.\nInventory\nAs a basis for the inventory of available DSTs intended for\nthe Baltic Sea and its drainage area, environmental manage-\nment problems, where decision-making is needed, were\nidentiﬁed (e.g., eutrophication, contaminant pollution, loss of\nbiodiversity, etc.). Responsibility for reviewing the avail-\nability of DST within these problem areas was then dis-\ntributed among the project participants based on speciﬁc\nexpertise. As participants in the project consortium have been\nwidely involved in both developing and using DSTs, there\nwas a good understanding of the availability of DST already\nfrom the start. In addition, web searches were performed to\nensure that other tools were not overlooked. For problem\nareas where there was no expertise in the project consortium\n(e.g., nonindigenous species, underwater noise, litter), inter-\nviews with experts in theﬁeld were made in order to identify\nDSTs. Ongoing and ﬁnished BONUS projects\n2 were also\ncontacted to scan for recently developed tools or tools still\nunder development. The list of identiﬁed tools was sent as\npart of the questionnaire to end users and stakeholders and\nthey were asked to add potential DSTs missed.\nInformation about the DSTs and their performance\nwere collected using a common template. The template\nconsisted of three parts: (1) general information including\nproblems, policies and DAPSIWRM components addres-\nsed, platform used, type of input data needed, description\nof outputs, a short description and information on devel-\noper/host, and where to ﬁnd the tool as well as links to\nspeciﬁc examples where the tool had been used; (2) DC\n(see Table 1); and (3) ﬁfteen performance criteria (PC)\n(see Table 2). The latter was described both in words and\nwith a 1–5 scale to further evaluate the tools. Theﬁlled\ntemplates (excluding the performance scoring) were sent\nto the developers or hosts of the DSTs for cross-checking\nand commenting, and the templates were updated\naccordingly. However, responses from hosts were\nreceived for only two thirds of the DTSs.\nPerformance Criteria (PC)\nA set ofﬁfteen PC was deﬁned to evaluate in greater detail\nhow the tools work and how they differ from each other (see\nTable 2). The PC mirror the scientiﬁc foundation of the\ntools, how well theyﬁt into Baltic Sea management as well\nas their user-friendliness, reﬂecting characteristics such as\nquality and relevance, that can be ranked according to\ngeneral performance, and descriptive qualities that need to\nbe considered case-speciﬁcally in the ranking. The aim was\nnot to rank the tools based on the PC but rather to shed light\non the applicability and transparency of the tools. For each\ncriterion, aﬁve-step scale was developed to reﬂect how well\nthe tools respond to the criteria. The scale is categorical, but\nwith increasing relevance. Generally, the value of 1 refers to\n“not fulﬁlling the criterion ” whereas 5 refers to “fully\ncomplying with the criterion”. The scale is deﬁned sepa-\nrately for each criterion.\nEnd User Involvement and Use of DSTs\nAs theﬁlled DST templates were sent to the hosts for cross-\nchecking, a questionnaire regarding the development of the\ntool and involvement of end users was attached. This\nTable 1 DESTONY DST\ndeﬁnition criteria (DC) #D e ﬁnition criteria (DC)\n(1) The tool is interactive in the sense that the end user is requested for input data or information and will\nsubsequently get outputs related to that. If the tool is based on a non-dynamic model that cannot show\ndifferent outcomes, the tool is not considered interactive.\n(2) The tool is virtual in the sense that it can be accessed and operated through the internet. A tool is not\nvirtual if you need to download it to your computer.\n(3) The purpose of the tool is to support decision-making in relation to degradation of the aquatic\nenvironment at local, regional, national, or international management scale. A single indicator is not\nseen as a tool.\n(4) The tool is primarily developed for use in the Baltic Sea or its drainage basin. If the tool is originally\ndeveloped for other sea areas but adapted primarily to the Baltic Sea the criteria applies. If the tool is\nrestricted to national waters, it needs to cover any of the DESTONY participating countries (Finland,\nSweden, Germany, Denmark).\n(5) The tool is applicable and accessible by the end user (whether policy maker or expert involved in\nmanagement) without unreasonable effort. The criteria does not apply in case of unreasonable efforts\nsuch as the tool cannot be found, or the tool needs to be used by the host.\n2 https://www.bonusportal.org/projects\n1026 Environmental Management (2020) 66:1024–1038\nTable 2 The performance criteria (PC) and scoring classes (1–5) used to evaluate the tools\nDeﬁnition of the performance criteria (PC) Evaluation scale\nPC1: Scientiﬁc documentation\nHas the DST been documented in scientiﬁc publication, etc.? 1 = no documentation found\n2 = earlier version in web but outdated\n3 = earlier version in report or scientiﬁc paper but outdated\n4 = updated documentation in web\n5 = updated documentation in report and/or scientiﬁc paper\nPC2: Complexity of method\nHow simple or complex is the method used for calculating the output? 1 = no quantitative analysis is applied; method is qualitative\n2 = simple quantitative method or descriptive statistics, e.g., one-out-all-out, sum,\naverage, median\n3 = fairly simple quantitative statistics, e.g., weighted average, regression\n4 = complex quantitative methods, e.g., multidimensional statistics\n5 = very complex analysis, e.g., dynamic models or combinations of several tools and\nprocesses\nPC3: Transparency of the DST\nAre all the processing described, is the code public, documentation, understandable?

The questionnaire was structured according to\nﬁve themes, each with a set of questions/statements to be\nanswered with yes or no: (1) initiation of tool development;\nincluding questions on what motivated the development of\nthe tool, (2) deﬁning end users; toﬁnd out if and at what\nstage in the development phase end users were identiﬁed,\n(3) end-user involvement; with questions on how end users\nwere involved in the development process, (4) maintaining\nand updating; to ﬁnd out if and by whom the tool is\nmaintained and updated, and (5) use of the tool; asking if\nthe host is satisﬁed with the way the tool has been used. The\nfull questionnaire can be found in Online Resource 1. The\nsurvey was answered by 27 DST hosts out of 42.\nBased on the results from the questionnaire on end-user\ninvolvement in development and use of DSTs, we examined\nif there are performance differences between (a) tools invol-\nving end users in the development phase, (b) tools that have\nbeen developed as a direct response to a management need,\n(c) tools where developers/hosts are satisﬁed with how tools\nhave been used, and (d) tools where this has not been the case.\nTable 2 (continued)\nDeﬁnition of the performance criteria (PC) Evaluation scale\n3 = has been tested/applied in several cases but in a limited number of systems\n4 = has been tested/applied in several contexts\n5 = has been applied to several cases in different types of contexts, and tested thoroughly\nPC10: Transferability\nHow easily can the tool be adapted to other systems (e.g., North Sea, fresh water systems,\netc.) by the end user?\n1 = not applicable to other systems\n2 = applying to other systems would require reconstruction\n3 = applying to other systems would require considerable updates\n4 = can be applied to other systems with minor adjustments\n5 = can be directly applied to other systems\nPC11: Thematic broadness\nHow generic is the DST? For example, which and how many policy issues (e.g.,\neutrophication, biodiversity, pollution, maritime activities etc.) does it address?\n1 = the DST is speciﬁc to an environmental policy issue (e.g., eutrophication) and highly\nspeciﬁc to its aspects; it addresses e.g., a speciﬁc species, habitat, nutrient levels, etc.\n2 = the DST is speciﬁc to an environmental policy issue (e.g., eutrophication) but can address\ndifferent aspects of it (e.g., indirect and direct effects)\n3 = a single application of the tool can deal with different environmental policy issues, but\nonly one at a time (e.g., it can be applied to biodiversity or eutrophication, but not\nsimultaneously)\n4 = the DST addresses two environmental policy issue at once (e.g., eutrophication and\nbiodiversity)\n5 = the DST is highlyﬂexible and can address various environmental policy issues at once\nPC12: Broadness of components of the DPSIR/DAPSIWRM addressed\nHow broadly does the tool handle the management chain of events, from drivers to\npressures, state changes, impacts to environment, social impacts, and responses of society\n(e.g., components in the DPSIR/DAPSIWRM cycle?) How many components does it\naddress?\n1 = very narrow use, restricted to one or few interactions\n2 = narrow, covers only one segment in the DAPSIWRM cycle, and inspects it narrowly\n3 = covers only one segment in the DAPSIWRM cycle, but inspects it broadly\n4 = covers two segments in the DAPSIWRM cycle\n5 = very generic, covering three or more segments in the DAPSIWRM cycle broadly\nPC13: Suitability to components operationally applied in the Baltic Sea\nHow well does the toolﬁt in with the approaches and methodology already agreed upon in\nthe area? Are the existing operational input components, e.g., monitoring data, indicators,\ncompatible with the tool when applied in the Baltic Sea? Or should the input data be\ncreated/collected separately. Is the output directly suitable as input, or collaborative\ninterpretation with output from other operational tools?\n1 = tool is not compatible to operational input or output components\n2 = tool is not fully compatible to operational input and output components, but could be\napplied with some adjustments\n3 = tool is not fully compatible to input components, but output can be applied operationally\n4 = tool is fully compatible to input components applied in the Baltic Sea, but output requires\nfurther adjustments\n5 = both input and output components are applied operationally in the Baltic Sea\nPC14: Ease of use/expertise required\nIs the tool generally applicable to non-expert users or restricted to experts? Is the DST easy\nto apply? Is there need for expertise in a speciﬁc ﬁeld (e.g., marine ecology, economics,\npolicy, etc.)?\n1 = can be applied only by dedicated experts throughout the process\n2 = tool is applied by experts, but less experienced users can interact during selected phases\n3 = application of the tool requires participation in a special training course\n4 = anyone can apply the tool after extensive reading of the manual\n5 = the tool is easy to use, and no special expertise are required\nPC15: Time effort\nHow much time is needed to apply the DST? i.e., How much time is needed from the choice\nof the tool for a speciﬁc problem to the output of concrete/usable results?\n1 = both preparation and application of the DST are time consuming (weeks or months)\n2 = preparation of the tool is rather quick (days), but application is time consuming (weeks or\nmonths)\n3 = preparation of the application is time consuming (weeks or months), but the application is\nrather quick (days)\n4 = both preparation and application of the DST are rather quick (days)\n5 = the DST can be directly applied and provides immediate results (e.g., in (stakeholder)\nmeetings) (within hours/one day)\n1028 Environmental Management (2020) 66:1024–1038\nEnd User Preferences\nAn online questionnaire was created to assess end users’\nlevel of knowledge about DSTs, their own use of the tools\nand their preferences for the predeﬁned PC (not including\nthe scoring categories). End users were asked for their per-\nception of importance of the DST PC into four categories:\n(1) very important, (2) important, (3) not so important, (4)\nnot important at all. The questionnaire was distributed using\nthe online software JotForm and made available during\nMarch 2019 (the questionnaire can be found in Online\nResource 2). Identiﬁed end users of DSTs included repre-\nsentatives of national, regional, and local administrations,\ninternational organizations and institutions (e.g., HELCOM,\nVASAB, ICES, EU), nongovernmental organizations\n(NGOs), as well as researchers represented in national or\ninternational working groups dealing with management\nissues related to the environment of the Baltic Sea and its\ndrainage basin. In total, 811 email invitations were sent to\npotential DST end users in all Baltic Sea countries. In\naddition, an invitation to participate was launched on the\nwebpage and social media pages (Twitter and Facebook) of\nthe Stockholm University Baltic Sea Center.\nIn total, 108 responses were received. Number of respon-\nses varied strongly between countries. 45% of all participants\nindicated to be working in Sweden, 19% in Finland, and 9%\nin Germany. Lithuania and Estonia were represented by 6%,\nDenmark and Latvia by 4%, and Poland and Russia by 2%.\nThree participants (3%) stated that they are working in mul-\ntiple countries and one EU representative from Ireland parti-\ncipated. Around half of the participants (53%) were\nrepresentatives of public administration, 38% from research\ninstitutes and universities, and 8% from NGOs. Others\nincluded participants from consultancies and private compa-\nnies and made up 5%. Participants had diverse thematic\nbackgrounds, such as eutrophication (55%), marine spatial\nplanning (MSP) (38%), marine habitats (36%), nature pro-\ntection (32%), marine litter (28%), hazardous substances\n(26%), ﬁsheries, coastal zone management (19% each), and\ncoastal protection (32%). Additional thematic ﬁelds were\nmentioned by 20% of the participants and included under-\nwater noise, acidi ﬁcation, invasive species, biodiversity,\nenvironmental economics, and social sciences.\nResults\nInventory\nA total of 42 DSTs were identiﬁe da sb e i n gu s e di nt h e\nBaltic Sea and drainage basin (Table3). Assessments of\nthe DSTs can be found in the DESTONY DST catalog3.\nOnly 12 tools fulﬁlled all ﬁve DESTONY DST DC, and\nfour of the DC were fulﬁlled by 14 tools. All 42 tools\nfulﬁlled the DC #3 (supports decision-making related to\ndegradation of the aquatic environment). DC #2 (the tool\ncan be accessed and operated on internet) turned out to be\ndecisive as it was fulﬁlled by only ~40% of the tools and\nnone of the tools with less than four fulﬁlled DC suc-\nceeded on this criterion. Most of the tools were directly\navailable, i.e., found on the internet, but they usually\nlacked a web interface and required downloading and\ninstallation of a software or downloading a script or code\nto be run in e.g., R, Matlab or other software requiring\nlicenses (e.g., GAMS). Approximately 25% of the DSTs\nwere not directly available for end users, but only acces-\nsible through contact with the host. The criterion on\ninteractivity, i.e., that theend user can modify inputs and/\nor settings of the tool, was fulﬁlled for about 80% of the\ntools. Examples of DSTs not fulﬁlling this criterion were\ntools in which the host feed data into a model and the end\nuser only inspects the model outputs for a given area and/\nor time period, i.e., the required input from the end user is\nonly to choose an area and/or a time period relevant for\nthe speciﬁc problem setting.\nDSTs were found to respond to all segments of the\nDAPSIWRM framework and covered a broad range of\nenvironmental problems (Figs 1 and 2). Nine tools were\nspeciﬁc to only one segment in the framework; of these,\nall but one treated state changes. Tools covering several\nsegments often focused on the links between activities,\npressures, and state changes. Drivers were only addressed\nby three DSTs and these were also the only ones to cover\nthe whole DAPSIWRM framework. The three DSTs\ncovering the full framework were of different types\n(model, stakeholder tool, and planning tool) and addres-\nsed different issues (biodiversity and conservation, impact\nevaluation, and sea-area use). All DAPSIWRM segments,\napart from drivers, could be covered using a single DST\nfor problems related to eutrophication, whereas for pro-\nblems related to contaminants, several tools were needed\nto cover the same segments. No tools dealing with\ncumulative effects of pressures, ﬁshery management,\nnoise, nonindigenous species, or hydrography were found\nto address issues related to impacts on welfare or\nresponses as measures.\nMost of the DSTs were different types of assessment\ntools (17 tools) and models (16 tools), but also planning\ntools (4 tools) and tools for stakeholders (5 tools) were\nidentiﬁed. Both models and assessment tools covered a\nwide range of environmental problems and could be used\nto assess environmental status or pressures. Also societal\n3 http://nest.su.se/bonus_dst/\nEnvironmental Management (2020) 66:1024–1038 1029\nimpacts and measures, including cost-effectiveness, could\nbe evaluated with these tools. Planning tools mainly\naddressed sea-area use, i.e., MSP. Stakeholder tools, i.e.,\nthe tool type for interactions with stakeholders, covered a\nvariety of problem settings including ﬁsheries, eutrophi-\ncation, conservation, and impact evaluation.\nTable 3 Identiﬁed decision-support tools (DSTs) listed in alphabetic order\nName Category Problem class DAPSIWRM\ncomponenta\nReference\nACC-HUMAN Model Contaminants P, S, IW Oltmans et al.

A clear majority of these DSTs scored high (5 or 4)\nin PC4 management relevance to the Baltic Sea (96% of the\nDSTs), PC1 scientiﬁcally documented (81% of the DSTs),\nand PC3 transparency (77% of the DSTs). In contrast, the\nDSTs scored low (1 or 2) in PC6 temporal limitations (69%\nof the DSTs), PC8 data dependencies (62% of the DSTs),\nand PC7 conﬁdence (58% of the DSTs).\nSome general pattern could be observed regarding how the\nDSTs covered the DAPSIWRM framework (Fig.4). DSTs\ncovering less than three DAPSIWRM segments, generally had\nhigher scores in PC7 conﬁdence and PC15 time effort, than\ntools covering more than three DAPSIWRM segments. Vice\nversa, DSTs covering more than three DAPSIWRM segments\napplied more complex methodologies (PC2) and were thema-\ntically broader (PC11) than DST that inspected the DAP-\nSIWRM framework more narrowly. Tools inspecting activities\n(n =11), pressures (n =16), or state changes (n =23) had high\nmanagement relevance (PC4), but where typically sensitive to\nthe type of input data (PC8) and were thematically narrower\n(PC11) than tools exploringthe other DAPSIWRM segments.\nDSTs addressing impacts on welfare (n =8) and responses\nusing measures (n =6) were generally thematically broad and\nﬂexible to different policy issues (PC11).\nComparing DSTs developed for different problem areas,\nsome general patterns could be observed, although the number\nof tools per problem area was low (Fig.5). Opportunities to\nexamine temporal changes (PC6) were best implemented in tools\nrelated to eutrophication (n =7) and contaminant pollution (n =\n3). DSTs addressing eutrophication were generally also well\ncompatible with available input data and the outputs were\noperationally used (PC13). Conﬁdence (PC7) was best docu-\nmented in DSTs dealing with biodiversity issues (n =5). Tools\naddressing impact evaluation (n =3) and sea area use (n =3)\ngenerally had a broad thematic scope (PC11), entailing several\npolicy issues. Transparency (PC3) and management relevance\n( P C 4 )w a sg e n e r a l l yh i g hi nD S T si na l lp r o b l e ma r e a s .\nThrough the eyes of an end user, the most important\nfeatures of a DST included PC3 transparency, PC7 con-\nﬁdence, PC4 management relevance to the Baltic Sea, and\nPC15 time effort, which 93%, 86%, 83%, and 82% of end\nusers, respectively, rated as very important or important\n(Fig. 6). PC15 Time effort was especially valued by end\nusers working in administration. PC deemed unimportant\nby end users were PC11 thematic broadness, PC10\ntransferability, and PC12 DAPSIWRM component\nbroadness, for which 67%, 60%, and 56% of end users,\nrespectively, responded not important at all or not so\nimportant.\nResponses from Hosts on Tool Development\nApproximately two thirds of the DST hosts answered\nthe survey related to the development and current use of the\ntools (Fig. 7). According to the answers, two thirds of the\ntools were initiated as a response to a management need.\nEnd users had a strong role in the initial tool development\nprocess for half of the DSTs. Once developed, the DSTs are\nmaintained and updated to a varying degree as 60% of the\ndeveloped DSTs had allocated funding for maintaining and\nupdating the tools. A quarter of the tools are not actively\nupdated or maintained. More than a third of the tools are\nreported not to be used for environmental management as\nintended by the tool hosts/developers.\nThe involvement of end users in DST development\nvaried between different problem areas (Table 4). Tools\naddressing eutrophication-related problems were normally\ndeveloped in close cooperation with end users, and in half\nof the DSTs end users were part of the development team.\nDSTs concentrating on impact evaluations and cumulative\neffects also had good contact with end users. For tools\naddressing questions related to biodiversity and conserva-\ntion as well as contaminants, end users were not well\nintegrated into the development process. Although contact\nwith end users was maintained when developing tools\nrelated to ﬁshery management, nonindigenous species and\nunderwater noise, the end users were not directly involved\nin the development teams.\nTo evaluate if (i) DSTs with end-user involvement in\ndevelopment, (ii) DSTs developed in response to a need,\nor (iii) DSTs where hosts were satisﬁed with the tool use\nperform better than where this has not been the case, we\nchose the three PC that end users valued the most, namely\nPC3 transparency, PC4 management relevance to the\nBaltic Sea, and PC7 con ﬁdence. However, only small\ndifferences were found in the median values between the\ngroups.\nDiscussion\nT h eD S T si no u ri n v e n t o r yo f t e nf o c u s e do ns p e c iﬁc\nenvironmental problems, an d seldom provided solutions\nfor a complete ecosystem a pproach or integrated man-\nagement of marine environment. The problems addressed\nin the tools mirror the main challenges in the Baltic Sea\n(HELCOM 2018c;R e u s c he ta l .2018). The most\naddressed problem in the existing DSTs, eutrophication,\nas well as the frequently addressed biodiversity and con-\ntaminant issues are deﬁned as priority areas in the HEL-\nCOM BSAP. Also, other marine environmental policies\nrelevant for the Baltic Sea, such as the EU WFD and the\nMSFD, focus on these environmental issues. Tools\nEnvironmental Management (2020) 66:1024–1038 1031\naddressing aspects relevant for the Maritime Spatial\nPlanning Directive, e.g., trade-offs between human\nactivities and conservation, were also well represented.\nRelatively new aspects from a marine management point-\nof-view, such as underwater noise and litter, were on the\nother hand incompletely represented in the inventory.\nCompliance with the Ecosystem Approch\nOne of our main interests was to investigate how the DSTs\nﬁt into the DAPSIWRM framework, as the ecosystem\napproach currently is the aim in marine management\n(Atkins et al. 2011; Elliott et al. 2017; Hyytiäinen et al.\n2014; Reusch et al.2018; Scharin et al.2016). As DSTs\nmost often are designed to deliver answers to speci ﬁc\nquestion settings (Sullivan 2004), it was not expected\nthat many tools would address the whole DAPSIWRM\nframework. This was also the case, as only three tools were\nfound to consider all segments. Most often, three or less\nsegments of the DAPSIWRM framework could be addres-\nsed with a single tool, with a dominant focus on the\nactivities–pressures–state changes segments or links\nbetween them. DSTs were found to address this part of the\nDAPSIWRM framework in almost all considered environ-\nmental problem areas. The links between activities and\npressures are well-deﬁned (e.g., HELCOM 2018b), and\nDSTs focusing on single pressures and DSTs estimating\ncumulative effects were found in the inventory. Dynamic\nmodels assessing pressure-related environmental changes\nand tools mapping pressures spatially were also found.\nSome of these DSTs covered the entire Baltic Sea, while\nothers were directed toward supporting management at\nnation level.

State assessment tools were often indi-\ncator-based, providing systems for integration and aggre-\ngation of indicator data.\nIt is evident that tools addressing the impacts on welfare\n(the socio-economic perspective) and linking to management\nresponses are clearly underrepresented compared to those\nconcentrating on the environmental and ecological impacts of\nhuman activities and the pressures they cause. A relatively\nlarge number of cost-effectiveness models have been devel-\noped and used to assess nutrient abatement in the Baltic Sea\n(e.g., Ahlvik et al.2014; Elofsson2010; Hasler et al.2014;\nHasler et al.2019; Hyytiäinen et al.2014), but the use of these\ntools to support choices between policy options are relatively\nrare. Some models are used in cost–beneﬁt analysis frame-\nworks that could qualify as DSTs (Hyytiäinen et al.2014;\nScharin et al.2016) ,b u tt h o s em a d ef o rt h eB a l t i cS e ah a v e\nnot been developed into DSTs. Also, Pınarbaşı et al. (2017)\nfound that DSTs used in MSP mostly focused on environ-\nmental problems and seldom incorporated socio-economic\naspects, which was also pointed out as a weakness by end\nu s e r so fM S Pt o o l s( Pınarbaşı et al.2019).\nAs DSTs addressing the impacts on welfare–responses\nusing measures–segments of the DAPSIWRM framework are\nso strongly underrepresented, we may conclude that the eco-\nsystem approach is not very well expressed by the currently\navailable DSTs. The fact that few tools addressing impacts on\nwelfare were operational online,underpins the need for further\ndevelopment of this aspect. Mee et al. (2015) describe chal-\nlenges of linking social and ecological components in the\necosystem approach, identifying an institutional gap between\nthe disciplines and e.g., differences in interpretation of impacts,\nwhile Hasler et al. (2016) and Scharin et al. (2016)d i s c u s s\nproblems linking marine data and economic models, but also\nsuggest solutions. Bateman et al. (2013) have, among others,\ndemonstrated that this is possible for terrestrial ecosystems,\nproviding guidelines for how anecosystem services mapping\nexercise can be made and used for decision support. Although\nthe DAPSIWRM framework clariﬁes such epistemic dis-\ncrepancies (Elliott et al.2017), solutions for better linkage of\nenvironmental and socio-economic aspects are not yet mirrored\nin the available DSTs. Tools that did estimate the impact on\nwelfare included a number of integrated indicator-based\nassessment methods, which were not exclusively focused on\nenvironmental aspects, but alsoconsidered economic aspects as\nwell as contributions to social well-being or welfare.

DSTs evaluating responses and measures linked back\nto the other segments in the DAPSIWRM framework. Most\nfrequently, measures were linked to state changes, but also\nactivities, pressures, and impacts on welfare were often\naddressed, allowing for a more holistic evaluation of the\neffectivity of measures.\nDrivers, setting the requirements for management, are\nformed by basic human needs (food, space, recreation, etc.),\nbut few of the existing DSTs actually identiﬁed such dri-\nvers. Many of the DSTs in our inventory responded to\nspeciﬁc question settings, where the societal drivers might\nbe clear although not directly included in the tool. In\ncomparison to the tools used in management, those directed\ntoward citizens to raise awareness on the impact of their\nconsumption, such as carbon footprint or nutrient pollution\ncalculators (not included in the inventory), often take a\nstarting point from the basic needs of people such as\nhousing, food, and transportation. Citizens can, based on the\ndrivers, evaluate how their consumption choices impact\ntheir welfare. Including clearer links to the drivers in\nmanagement tools could help in identifying alternative\nsolutions to fulﬁll the needs, thus facilitating the assessment\nof impacts on welfare. Consequently, this would facilitate\nappliance of the ecosystem approach.\nPerformance of DSTs and End User Preferences\nIn general, the DSTs included in our inventory were well\ndocumented and transparent. DSTs are most often science-\ndriven (Bolman et al.2018), meaning that transparency and\nrepeatability (i.e., that methodology is sufﬁciently descri-\nbed), is of high standard in the tools. Transparency was\nalso, together with conﬁdence, one of the most important\nproperties end users pointed out. Transparency and con-\nﬁdence are important factors in the decision-making pro-\ncess, as managers may need to defend their decision choices\nto stakeholders (Verweij and van Densen2010). Conﬁdence\nestimates can facilitate the decision-making, whereas\ntransparency makes it easier to explain the background and\ndefend the decision choice.\nConﬁdence was one of the PC scoring lowest among the\ntools in our study. Challenges in estimating the uncertainty\nis often a reason for not communicating uncertainty in DST\noutputs (Borja et al. 2016; van Beest et al. 2020). As\nmeasures can be expensive to carry out, managers want to\nbe conﬁdent in any decision taken. In environmental man-\nagement, reducing the uncertainty in available information\ncan prove cost-efﬁcient (Nygård et al. 2016). van Beest\net al. (2020) discuss possibilities for improving commu-\nnication of uncertainty in decision-support tools, arguing\nthat in order to successfully manage the environment,\nsources of uncertainty need to be quantiﬁed, incorporated,\nand communicated throughout the tool development and\ndecision-making process.\nBroadness of tools, both in ability to inspect several\npolicy issues and segments in the DAPSIWRM framework,\nwas generally not considered important by end users. In fact,\nthis was also reﬂected in the existing DSTs: they did not\nperform well in the criterion. As mentioned, DSTs should\nprovide answers to speciﬁc questions (Sullivan 2004) and\nthis is obviously also something end users value. The\nchallenges in applying the ecosystem approach in a single\nDST discussed earlier in combination with the wish for\nspeciﬁc DSTs imply that instead of one universal tool, a\ntoolbox of DSTs seem to be the most realistic way to\nimplement the ecosystem approach in marine management.\nAn optimal way forward would be that the DSTs in this\nIni/g415a/g415on of tool development\nDeﬁning end-users\nEnd-user involvement\nMaintenance and upda/g415ng\nUse of the tool\n0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%\nExternal project\nItera/g415vely over years\nResponse to need\nAt ini/g415a/g415on\nAlong the way\nContact when applying\nEnd-user = Developer\nThrough interviews etc.\nIni/g415a/g415ng development\nConsultance\nIn development team\nMaintaining and upda/g415ng\nNot maintained/updated\nBy single experts\nMaintenance funded\nHost sa/g415sﬁed\nNot been applied\nUsed but not for DS\nYes\nNo\nNo answer\nFig. 7 Results from the\nquestionnaire to DST\ndevelopers/hosts on the\ninvolvement of end users in the\ndevelopment of the tools.N =\n27 (27 DST developers/host\nresponded to the questionnaire).\nThe full questions are presented\nin Online Resource 1\n1034 Environmental Management (2020) 66:1024–1038\ntoolbox had the ability to utilize the outputs from one tool as\ninputs into the next one. Such a toolbox would maintain\ntransparency, but potentially impede estimates of uncertainty\nsources to be retained throughout the management chain.\nAlthough the spatial dimension is well incorporated in\nthe DSTs, the examination of temporal aspects is usually\nrestricted. The DSTs are most often temporallyﬁxed, e.g.,\nto the current situation or to a certain assessment period or\nscenario, not incorporating temporal trends or projections\ninto future. A similar lack in DSTs used in MSP was also\nidentiﬁed by Pınarbaşı et al. (2017). DSTs are usually also\ndependent on a certain type of data input, not alwaysﬂex-\nible to fully incorporate e.g., available monitoring data or\noperationally produced data products such as indicator data.\nHost Experiences\nA marked number of the DST hosts were of the opinion that\ntheir tool had not been applied by the management community\nto the extent expected and/or could not say that they were\nsatisﬁed with the way the end users applied their tool. Part of\nthe hosts had the impression thattheir tool was applied broadly,\nalthough not for decision-making. Put together, this suggests\nthat the existing DSTs are not applied to their full potential.\nFurthermore, it seems that even though many end users are\nwell informed, there is an information gap between the supply/\ndevelopment and use/demand of DSTs.\nOne way of increasing the knowledge, experience, and\ncommitment of end users to DSTs is through involvement\nalready during the development phase. End user involvement\nin DST development is important for improving user-\nfriendliness and ability to account for issues related to the\ndecision-making process (Pınarbaşı et al.2017;B o l m a ne ta l .\n2018). End user involvement is also needed to improve\ninclusion of existing regulatory and legal demands (Pınarbaşı\net al.2019). We suggest that a common feature to a successful\nDST is early involvement of end users, since this promotes end\nuser commitment and ensures a more accurate implementation\nof their needs. Most of the DSTs in the Baltic Sea area were\ndeveloped in response to a need, and half of the DSTs were\nactually initiated by end users. End users, however, had been\npart of the development team in less than a quarter of the cases.\nInvolvement through interviews and questionnaires was more\ncommon, but to secure that DSTsare user-friendly (also for\nnon-scientists) and increase their use, closer involvement of end\nusers is recommended.\nConcluding Remarks\nIn summary, the currently available DSTs address the major\nenvironmental problems in the Baltic Sea. To facilitate the\nimplementation of the ecosystem approach, we suggest that\nTable 4 The number of DSTs in which end users have been involved in the development of the DSTs for different problem topics\nEutrophication\n(n = 5)\nImpact\nevaluation\n(n = 5)\nBiodiversity and\nconservation\n(n = 4)\nContaminants\n(n = 3)\nCumulative\neffects\n(n = 4)\nSea-area\nuse (n = 2)\nFishery\nmanagement\n(n = 1)\nNonindigenous\nspecies (n = 1)\nNoise\n(n = 1)\nHydrography\n(n = 1)\nThrough interviews etc. 5 5 2 1 2 1 1 1 1 1\nInitiating development 3 1 2 1 3 0 1 1 0 1\nConsultance 4 3 2 1 2 1 0 1 0 1\nIn development team 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\nMaintaining and\nupdating\n32 3 1 0 1 0 0 0 1\nNote that we did not get answers to from all developers/hosts,N = 27.
