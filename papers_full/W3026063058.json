INTRODUCTION\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortalities.\nEarly diagnosis of lung cancer is one of the effective ways to\nreduce the related death. With prevailing application of low-\ndose computed tomography (LDCT), increasing number of\nearly-stage pulmonary nodules have become a challenge in\nclinical practice. In particular, a set of subjects with multiple\npulmonary nodules raises research attention [1]. Except for\ncertain “easy-to-diagnose” diseases, e.g., evident pulmonary\nmetastases and pulmonary tuberculosis, incidental multiple\npulmonary nodules are considered as a dilemma in clinical\ncontext. Diagnosis of multiple pulmonary nodules is more\ncomplicated than solitary ones; apart from analyzing the bi-\n∗Corresponding author: Bingbing Ni.\nological behaviors (e.g., benign, indolent, invasive), radiolo-\ngists are required to analyze diverse circumstances.\nRecent data-driven approach, e.g., radiomics and deep\nlearning, has been dominating Computer-Aided Diagnosis\n(CADx) research. Few prior study on lung nodule detection\nand characterization works on learning the relations between\nmultiple nodules; in other words, prior studies use solitary-\nnodule approaches on multiple nodular patients. In clinical\npractice, radiologists use information at nodule level and pa-\ntient level to diagnose nodules from the same subject; from an\nalgorithmic perspective, solitary-nodule approaches classify\nnodules without considering relation / context information.\nWe argue that relation does matter , thereby a multiple in-\nstance learning (MIL) approach is proposed to address this\nissue. To our knowledge, it is the ﬁrst study to learn the re-\nlations between multiple pulmonary nodules. Inspired by the\nrecent advances in NLP domain [2], we introduce Set Atten-\ntion Transformers (SATs) based on self-attention to learn the\nrelations between nodules, instead of typical pooling-based\naggregation in multiple instance learning. To model lung nod-\nules from CT scans, a 3D DenseNet [3–6] is used as backbone\nto learn representations of voxels at solitary-nodule level. We\nthen use the SATs to learn the relations between multiple\nnodules from the same patient. The whole network, named\nNoduleSAT, could be trained end-to-end. In lung nodule false\npositive reduction and malignancy classiﬁcation tasks, the\nproposed multiple-nodule approach consistently outperforms\nthe solitary-nodule baselines.\nThe key contributions of this paper are threefold: 1) We\nempirically prove the beneﬁt to learn the relations between\nnodules; 2) We develop Set Attention Transformers (SATs)\nto perform the relational learning; 3) An end-to-end trainable\nNoduleSAT is shown effective in modeling multiple nodules.\nWe empirically prove the beneﬁt of relation learning between\nmultiple pulmonary nodules, which could also inspire clinical\nand biological research on this important topic.\narXiv:2004.05640v1  [eess.IV]  12 Apr 2020\n2. METHODOLOGY\n2.1. Set Attention Transformers (SATs)\nInspired by the self-attention transformers [2], we develop a\nSet Attention Transformer (SATs), a general module designed\nfor processing the is permutation-invariant and size-varying\nset. In this study, the set is the multiple nodules from a same\npatient, and the SAT is designed to learn the relations between\nthe multiple pulmonary nodules. For an input set X ∈RN×c\n(N denotes the size of the set, and cdenotes the channels of\nrepresentation), a scaled dot-product attention is formulated\nby sharing the K, Qand V features [2],\nAttn(X) =softmax(XXT/√c) ·σ(X), (1)\nwhere σis a non-linearity activation function.\nHowever, the Multi-Head Attention (MHA) [2] is too\nmuch ponderous in our application, we introduce a more\nparameter-efﬁcient Group Shufﬂe Attention (GSA) [7] for\nSATs. Suppose g to be the number of groups ( g = 8in this\nstudy), cg = c/g, s.t. c mod g = 0, we divide X by chan-\nnels into ggroups: {X(i) ∈RN×cg }, and apply group linear\ntransform by the weight Wg ∈ Rcg×cg , before the scaled\ndot-product attention (Eq. 1). In-group scaled dot-production\nattention is applied in each group. However, grouping the in-\nputs in all layers results in the no communication between the\nelements in the sets. For this reason, a parameter-free opera-\ntor, channel shufﬂe ψ[7], is introduced to encourage channel\nfusion. The overall formalization of GSA is as follows,\nGSA(X) =BN(ψ(concat{Attn(Xi)|Xi = X(i)Wi}i=1,..,g) +X), (2)\nwhere Batch Normalization BN[8] is introduced to ease the\noptimization. The parameter size of GSA is up to 4g×smaller\nthan MHA, which makes the SATs very light-weight and easy\nto learn. An SAT is simply anL-layer stack of GSA operator.\n2.2. 3D DenseNet Backbone\nTo end-to-end learn the representation of lesion voxels from\nCT scans, we apply a 3D DenseNet [3–6] as backbone, with a\ncompression rate θ= 2and a bottleneckB = 4. Leaky ReLU\n(α = 0.1) together with Batch Normalization [8] are used\nas activation functions. We instantiate various DenseNets for\ndifferent experiments (Sec 3).\nBefore inputting into the 3D DenseNet, the nodule voxels\nfrom CT scans are pre-processed with the following proce-\ndure: 1) clip the Hounsﬁeld units into [−1024,400], 2) lin-\nearly transformed into [−1,1], and 3) resize the volumetric\ndata into a spacing of 1mm×1mm×1mmwith trilinear in-\nterpolation. We also apply online data augmentation includ-\ning 90◦,180◦,270◦rotation in random axis, left-right ﬂipping\nand shifting the voxel centers in [−1,1].\nCT Sequence \nfrom a Subject Voxels Shared Network Set Attention Transformer\nUndefined Label\nMalignant\nGAP3D DenseNet\nGAP3D DenseNet\nBenign\nGAP3D DenseNet\nAttention\nELU\nAttention\nELU\nAttention\nELU\nFig. 1 : Model architecture of NoduleSATs. We demon-\nstrate the multiple pulmonary nodule malignancy classiﬁca-\ntion task on the ﬁgure. V olumes of multiple pulmonary nod-\nules from the same subject (patient) are input for a shared 3D\nDenseNet, to produce nodule-level representations via global\naverage pooling (GAP). A Set Attention Transformer (SAT) is\nused for learning the relations between the multiple nodules,\nand it outputs a reﬁned representation for each nodule. For\nloss back-propagation, we only accumulate the classiﬁcation\nloss for the nodules with “malignant” and “benign” labels,\nand ignore the nodules with ambiguous labels.\n2.3. End-to-end NoduleSAT\nCombining the SATs and 3D DenseNets, the proposed net-\nwork for learning the relations between multiple pulmonary\nnodules is named NoduleSAT (1). We treat the multiple pul-\nmonary nodules from a same subject (patient) as a set, and use\na shared-weight 3D DenseNet [3–6] to extract nodule-level\nrepresentation for each nodule. These representations are fed\ninto an L-layer SAT with hidden sizeHto learn the relations.\nNote that the whole NoduleSAT network could be trained\nend-to-end by standard back-propagation. Experiments on\nnodule false positive reduction (Sec. 3.1) and nodule malig-\nnancy classiﬁcation (Sec. 3.2) are conducted to validate the\nusefulness of the proposed method. For both tasks, the Nod-\nuleSAT is trained to classify whether the multiple candidates\n/ nodules from a same patient are nodules / malignant or not.\nSpeciﬁcally for the nodule malignancy classiﬁcation task, to\ntake advantage of the nodules with ambiguous / undeﬁned la-\nbels, we design a masked BCE loss to train the NoduleSATs.\nFor solitary-nodule approaches, these data samples are non-\ntrivial to use. In our NoduleSAT framework, these nodules\nare ignored in the loss back-propagation, but presented as in-\nput to provide important context information to other nodules.\nThe masked loss strategy extend the effective sample size, and\nis shown to be effective in our experiments (Sec 3.2).\nIt is notable that the proposed NoduleSAT network is\nfundamentally different from a prior study using multiple\ninstance learning on lung nodules [9], where a max-pooling\naggregate multiple-nodule information and output a single\npatient-level representation. Thereby, no relational informa-\ntion between the multiple nodules could be captured. As\na comparison, relational information could be learned via\nlayer-by-layer self-attention in the proposed NoduleSAT.\n3. EXPERIMENTS\n3.1. Lung Nodule False Positive Reduction\n3.1.1. Dataset\nFalse positive reduction (FPR) in lung nodule detection has\nalways been a demanding task in computer-aided detection\nresearch. Due to the objectively existing correlation and\nlargely varied size of nodules from a subject, our SAT is more\nthan suitable to address this problem.\nWe use two datasets for this experiment. One is LUNA16,\na widely used dataset for lung nodule detection and false pos-\nitive reduction. The LUNA16 dataset consists of CT scans of\n888 subjects with 1186 nodules. The evaluation result is pro-\nvided as 10-fold cross validation using the ofﬁcial split. The\nLUNA16 FPR dataset uses the candidate list provided by the\ncompetition host, totally 754,975 candidates. We ﬁlter out\nthe candidates with a predicted score (by our 3D DenseNets\nbaseline) lower than 0.1, resulting in 32,405 candidates for\nfurther reﬁnement by our SATs. The second dataset is Tianchi\nLung Nodule Detection dataset1, a dataset of similar data pro-\ntocol as LUNA16, while it consists of800 subjects with 1,224\nnodules in total. We use the ofﬁcial split, with 600 subjects\n(975 nodules) for training and 200 subjects (269 nodules) for\nvalidation. The performance are reported on the validation set\n(named Tianchi V AL). We use our nodule detection model\n(based on a 3D UNet) trained on training set, to extract the\ncandidates on the CT scans, resulting in 5,531 candidates on\nthe training set, 1,515 on the validation set.\nTable 1: Lung nodule false positive reduction performance.\nDataset Method Average FROC (CPM)\nLUNA16 [10]\n2D-CNN [11] 0.790\n3D-CNN [12] 0.908 2\n3D DenseNet 0.884\nNoduleSAT 0.916\nTianchi V AL 3D DenseNet 0.677\nNoduleSAT 0.716\n3.1.2. Experiment Setting\nA 3D CNN based on DenseNets [3] is used as a strong base-\nline. The input size is 48 ×48 ×48. At each resolution\nlevel, dense blocks are repeated [4,4,4,4] times before each\ndown-sampling, with a growth rate of 16. We use an Adam\noptimizer for training the CNN with a batch size of 32, with\nan initial learning rate 1 ×10−3. We exponentially decay the\nlearning rate with a ratio of 3 ×10−2 after every epoch. The\n1https://tianchi.aliyun.com/competition/entrance/231601/introduction\n2We refer to their updated result (https://luna16.grand-challenge.org/), the\npublication paper result is 0.827.\ncandidates from the same subject, represented by the features\nafter the global average pooling of CNN, are fed together into\nan SAT. Since there are too many candidates on certain sub-\njects, we ﬁx the pre-trained 3D DenseNet to train the SAT.\nThe SAT in the false positive reduction experiments uses\nH = 256and L= 3. We use an Adam optimizer with a batch\nsize of 64. The initial learning rate is 5 ×10−3. We multiply\nthe learning rate by 0.2 at epoch = 100,130 and 170. 200\nepochs are enough for a good convergence. The training loss\nis a cross entropy loss averaged by the number of candidates.\n3.1.3. Result\nWe use CPM score for evaluation, the most commonly used\nmetric for lung nodule detection and false positive reduction.\nCPM score is the average recall rate at an average number of\nfalse positives at 0.125,0.25,0.5,1.0,2.0,4.0 and 8.0 on the\nFROC curve, the higher is better.\nResults are shown in Table 1, our SAT-based method im-\nproves the baseline by a large margin. On Tianchi V AL, our\nmodel improves more signiﬁcantly. Note that a 10-run vot-\ning ensemble usually provides only1% performance boost on\nthis dataset. We declare that these improvements come from\nlearning the relations between the candidates.\n3.2. Multiple Nodule Malignancy Classiﬁcation\n3.2.1. Dataset\nWe then use the NoduleSAT to provide a systemic view on\nmalignancy of multiple pulmonary nodules. LIDC-IDRI [13],\none of the largest public available lung cancer screening\ndatabases, is used for validating our method. As depicted in\nFig 2 (a), patients in LIDC-IDRI dataset have 1 - 23 nodules,\nof which 74.0% are multiple nodular patients. Therefore,\nthe proposed NoduleSAT network is well suitable for this\ntask. The data inclusion criteria are: 1) the nodule should be\nannotated by at least 3 radiologists, and 2) the CT thickness≤\n3mm. 2,175 qualiﬁed nodules are selected in total; we then\ncompute the average malignancy score (savg) of each nodule,\nresulting in 527 malignant (savg >3), 656 benign (savg <3)\nand 992 undeﬁned-label (or ambiguous, savg = 3) nodules.\n3.2.2. Experiment Setting\nWe ﬁrst pre-train a 3D DenseNet with a 32 ×32 ×32 in-\nput. The dense blocks are repeated [3,8,4] times before each\ndown-sampling, with a growth rate k = 32. The training\nsamples are only the 1,183 benign or malignant nodules. The\n3D DenseNet is trained with a standard cross entropy loss.\nWe train the 3D DenseNet using an Adam optimizer with an\ninitial learning rate of 0.001 for 200 epochs, and halve the\nlearning rate every 30 epochs.\nWe then construct a NoduleSAT, using the pre-trained 3D\nDenseNet and a 3-layer SAT (H = 256). We train the Nod-\nuleSAT end-to-end with a batch of 16 patients. Note the batch\nsize for 3D DenseNet is variable. We ﬁx the Batch Normal-\nization layer to stabilize the training. All qualiﬁed 2,175 nod-\nules are used for training the NoduleSAT, with a masked loss\nto backward on benign and malignant nodules only. We train\nthe whole NoduleSAT with an Adam optimizer, whose learn-\ning rate is initially 0.001, halved every 15 epochs for 150\nepochs totally. Another NoduleSAT with 1,183 benign or ma-\nlignant nodules are also trained for fair comparison.\n3.2.3.

The blue bar denotes the\neffective data samples with the corresponding method, and\nthe red curve denotes the AUC with various settings.\nWe report the AUC (AUROC) with a 5-fold cross valida-\ntion for evaluating our method, where each fold is split by the\npatients, while keeping roughly the same number of nodules\nin each fold. As depicted in Figure 2 (b), NoduleSAT and the\nmasked loss are both effective to boost malignancy classiﬁca-\ntion performance from the baseline 3D DenseNet. We ﬁgure\nout two important ﬁndings: 1) NoduleSAT with only the be-\nnign or malignant nodules outperforms 3D DenseNet with the\nsame dataset, and we attribute the improvement to learning\nthe relations. 2) NoduleSAT with the undeﬁned-label nod-\nules, using masked loss, boosts the performance further. We\nargue that this improvement comes from learning the con-\ntext. Our method elegantly uses the undeﬁned-label samples,\nwhich is non-trivial for solitary-nodule approaches.\n4. CONCLUSION AND FURTHER WORK\nIn this study, we propose a Set Attention Transformer (SAT),\nto explicitly learn relational information between multiple\npulmonary nodules from a same subject. Intergated with\na 3D DenseNet, the proposed end-to-end trainable Nodule-\nSAT encourages the model to learn top-down inter-nodule\nrelations from bottom-up nodule-level representations.\nWe are working on clinical problems on multiple pul-\nmonary nodules. Hopefully, our data-driven methodology\ncould beneﬁt understanding etiologic and biologic processes\nand metastasis diagnosis of multiple pulmonary nodules.\nAcknowledgment.
