  "abstract": "This study presents the fabrication of a 3D micro-transformer using MEMS technology in 10-600 kHz frequency range.The fabrication processes is developed for high-performance and low-cost realization with respect to planner design.The coil winding and the magnetic cores were fabricated by electro-deposition using copper and Ni/Fe Permalloy materials, respectively.In step-up configuration, the micro-transformer achieved 73.75% efficiency.The inductance achieved was 90 and 164 µH for primary and secondary coils, respectively.Characterization results and fabrication process of the fabricated transformer (2560×1240 µm) on alumina ceramic substrate are presented.",
