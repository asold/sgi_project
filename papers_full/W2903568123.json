  "abstract": "One of the most serious possible faults in power systems is transformer limited fault (TLF), in which transient recovery voltage (TRV) characteristics is determined by the closest transformer to the circuit breaker and due to the immense variety of transformers; performing experimental tests to determine TRV in all cases is impossible. Therefore, simulation is recommended. Purpose of this paper is to review existing methods for transformers modeling in TRV studies and compare their results with the measurement results. Three different models including impedance model, simplified model and frequency dependent model are studied. All models are obtained using transformer FRA results. Then modelling is done for three separate transformers. Also the application and proposed guidelines of model selection are suggested. Finally, TRV simulations are performed in EMTPWorks using capacitive current injection method. As a result, amplitude factor and TRV frequency are calculated for each model and simulation and measurement results are compared. Keywords: Transformer modelling, Transient recovery voltage, Transformer limited fault, FRA test, Current injection method, TRV frequency",
