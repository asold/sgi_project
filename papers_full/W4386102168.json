    "abstract": "Obtaining text datasets with semantic annotations is an effortful process, yet crucial for supervised training in natural language processing (NLP). In general, developing and applying new NLP pipelines in domain-specific contexts for tasks often requires custom-designed datasets to address NLP tasks in a supervised machine learning fashion. When operating in non-English languages for medical data processing, this exposes several minor and major, interconnected problems such as the lack of task-matching datasets as well as task-specific pre-trained models. In our work, we suggest to leverage pre-trained large language models for training data acquisition in order to retrieve sufficiently large datasets for training smaller and more efficient models for use-case-specific tasks. To demonstrate the effectiveness of your approach, we create a custom dataset that we use to train a medical NER model for German texts, GPTNERMED, yet our method remains language-independent in principle. Our obtained dataset as well as our pre-trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/frankkramer-lab/GPTNERMED.",
