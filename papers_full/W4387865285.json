    "abstract": "The application of big data technology combined with large language models is expected to make an enormous impact in the field of medicine. Herein, the prospects for the application of healthcare big data combined with large language models were discussed in several aspects, including first in assisting doctors in making diagnosis and differential diagnosis and, then, in the field of evidence-based medicine. In addition, healthcare big data combined with large language models could also be applied in assisting doctors to conduct clinical and medical research. Through combining healthcare big data with large language models, medical diagnosis and treatment with improved precision, efficiency, and intelligence will be realized and greater contributions will be made to the field of human health.",
