    "abstract": "This paper presents a theoretical model and its experimental validation for the pressure ratio of a swash plate-rotating hydraulic transformer. The structure and principle of the new type of transformer are described. The swash plate-rotating type can reduce the throttling loss caused by the valve plate in traditional hydraulic transformers. The theoretical model of the pressure ratio was derived based on the displacements functioning as the pump and motor in the transformer, accounting for the friction losses. A specific experimental setup including the prototype was established to validate the principle and pressure ratio of the machine. The results show that the transformer has a wider pressure range. The increase in pressure at port A and the rotating speed of the cylinder can reduce the pressure ratio slightly due to the torque loss. The present work indicates the useful potential of the swash plate-rotating hydraulic transformer.",
