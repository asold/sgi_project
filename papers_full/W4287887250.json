Weplantomakeourmodel\ncheckpoints publicly available.\n1 Introduction\nMultilingualpretrainedlanguagemodelshavebeen\nuseful for a wide variety of NLP tasks. pretrain-\ning on large-scale multilingual corpora facilitates\ntransfer across languages and benefits low-resource\nlanguages.\nPreviously, sentence-level or word-level cross-\nlingualobjectiveshavebeenconsideredforpretrain-\ning large language models (LLM), but not much\nefforthasbeenputindocument-levelobjectivesfor\npretraining. Inthiswork,weproposeamultilingual\nsequence-to-sequence language model pretrained\nwith cross-lingual structure-aware document-level\nobjectives. DOCmT5is built on top of mT5 (Xue\netal.,2021)andisfurthertrainedwithparalleldoc-\numents across multiple language pairs. To encour-\nage the model to gain a deep understanding of the\ndocument structure and cross-lingual relationships,\nwe consider a challenging translation scenario as a\nsecond-stage pretraining task: the input sentences\nare shuffled in a random order and random spans\nare masked. To effectively translate the input docu-\nment, the model needs to reconstruct the document\nin the original order, making the model learn sen-\ntence relationships, and also recover the masked\nspans. This objective is effective on document-\nlevel generation tasks such as machine translation\nand cross-lingual summarization, outperforming\nprevious best systems.\nTo enable cross-lingual pretraining at a large\nscale, we created a synthetic parallel document cor-\npus. To avoid expensive human annotation, we\nuse off-the-shelf neural machine translation (NMT)\nmodels to translate the documents in the mC4 cor-\npus (Xue et al., 2021) into English. In our exper-\nimental results, this corpus is more effective for\npretraining than existing large-scale automatically\naligned corpora (e.g., CCAligned (El-Kishky et al.,\n2020)).\nWe also conduct extensive ablation studies and\nprovideinsightsondocument-levelpretraining. We\nshow that simple document-level pretraining is\nmoreusefulthansentence-levelpretrainingforgen-\nerative tasks. We also show that data quality mat-\nters when performing multilingual document pre-\ntraining. Finally, we don’t observe improvements\nfrom combining mono-lingual and cross-lingual\nobjectives when evaluating on two document-level\ntranslation tasks.\nIn summary, this paper makes the following con-\ntributions:\n• We build a state-of-the-art multilingual\ndocument-level sequence-to-sequence lan-\nguagemodelpretrainedwithastructure-aware\ncross-lingual objective.\n425\nDOC mT5\n你必須  <MASK> \n你的  <MASK> 去呵護  \n那些寶貴的關係。  \n \n<MASK> 是無可取代的。  \nFamily is irreplaceable.  \nYou have to devote your time\nto nurturing those precious\nrelationships.\nYour purpose in life is to find\nyour purpose.

Some\npopular models are: mBERT (Devlin et al., 2019)\nand XLM-R (Conneau et al., 2020) which pretrain\nwith masked language modeling objective using\nonly monolingual data, mT5 (Xue et al., 2021) and\nmBART (Liu et al., 2020) which use a sequence-\nto-sequence language model and pretrain on large-\nscale mono-lingual corpora across many languages.\nOur proposed model uses mT5 as a backbone and\nfurther utilizes pseudo-parallel documents to learn\nbetter cross-lingual representations.\nTo capture cross-lingual information, translation\nlanguage modeling (Conneau and Lample, 2019)\nand its variants (VECO (Luo et al., 2021), ERNIE-\nM (Ouyang et al., 2021)) was proposed to leverage\nsentence-level parallel data. AMBER (Hu et al.,\n2021) use two explicit alignment objectives that\nalignrepresentationsatthewordandsentencelevel.\nHICTL (Wei et al., 2020) pretrains on parallel sen-\ntences with word and sentence-level contrastive\nlosses. mBART50 (Tang et al., 2021), mT6 (Chi\net al., 2021) and nmT5 (Kale et al., 2021) focus\non second-stage of pretraining using large-scale\nsentence-level translation data. Our model goes be-\nyond the sentence and focuses on document-level\nunderstanding.\nWhile sentence-level pretraining has received\na lot of attention, document-level pretraining has\nbeen under-studied. Unicoder (Huang et al., 2019)\nreplaces alternating sentences in a document with\ntranslations and pretrains with masked language\nmodeling. MARGE (Lewis et al., 2020) adopts the\nretriever-generator paradigm and pretrains with an\nunsupervisedtranslationobjectiveonautomatically\nretrieved documents. M2M100 (Fan et al., 2021)\npretrains sequence-to-sequence language models\non automatically mined parallel sentences and doc-\numents. Our model considers a challenging super-\nvised translation objective on parallel documents.\n2.2 Multilingual Parallel Data Sources\nOPUS-100 (Aharoni et al., 2019; Zhang et al.,\n2020a)iscollectedfromavarietyofdomainsandis\nhuman labeled but it is at the sentence level. ML50\n(Tang et al., 2021) is collected from different ma-\nchinetranslationchallengesandotherpubliclyavail-\nable corpora such as OPUS, but most of the data\nis at the sentence level. CCMatrix (Schwenk et al.,\n2021b)andWikimatrix(Schwenketal.,2021a)use\nmultilingual sentence embedding to automatically\nmine parallel sentences. Perhaps the most closest\nto our proposed corpus is CCAligned (El-Kishky\net al., 2020), which is also automatically mined but\nitsqualityisinquestion(Kreutzeretal.,2021).

Just to name a few,\nprevious works have explored concatenation-based\nmethods (Tiedemann and Scherrer, 2017; Junczys-\nDowmunt, 2019; Sun et al., 2020; Lopes et al.,\n2020), multi-source context encoder (Zhang et al.,\n2018; Jean et al., 2017), and hierarchical networks\n(Zhengetal.,2020;Zhangetal.,2020b;Chenetal.,\n2020). Thislineofresearchfocusesonarchitectural\nmodifications of neural translation models. We fo-\ncus on how to design a generalized pretraining ob-\njectiveandfurthermore,ourmodelcanbefinetuned\nfor various downstream tasks (e.g. summarization)\nwithout task-specific changes.\n3 Multilingual Pretraining\n3.1 Datasets\n3.1.1 mC4\nFor pretraining, we use mC4 (Xue et al., 2021), a\nlarge scale corpus extracted from Common Crawl\nthat covers over 100 languages.\n3.1.2 MTmC4: Creating Parallel Documents\nwith mC4\nTo create large-scale parallel documents, we take\nmC4 as a starting point and use in-house NMT\nmodels to translate documents from 25 languages\ninto English. Each sentence in each document is\ntranslated independently. For each language, we\nsample 1 million documents, if there are more than\nthat to start with, in mC4. Detailed data statistics\nfor all the languages can be found in Table 2.\n3.2 Document Reordering Machine\nTranslation (DrMT)\nWe start by introducing two related pretraining ob-\njectives:\n• NMT Pretraining: Tang et al. (2021) and\nKale et al. (2021) proposed to perform a\nsecond-stage of pretraining using sentence-\nlevel MT data. The objective here is to per-\nform sentence-level translation without any\nother changes to the input.\n• Monolingual Document Reordering (Dr) Pre-\ntraining: Thisobjective,proposedbymBART\n(Liuetal.,2020),changestheorderofthesen-\ntencesineachdocument. Thisisthenfollowed\nbytheoriginalspancorruptionobjectiveinT5.\nThe decoder is required to generate the origi-\nnal document in order.\nWe combine these two objectives and propose\nDrMT. InDrMT, we introduce two types of noise\n427\non the input:(i) sentences in the document are ran-\ndomly shuffled and(ii) randomly sampled spans\nare masked. In order to correctly translate the con-\ntent, the model needs to decipher the corrupted\ndocument in order first. This enforces the models\nto gain deep understanding of the document struc-\nture. More formally, suppose we have N language\npairs and each language has a set of parallel doc-\numents, the whole collection of document pairs\nare 𝐷 = {𝐷1, 𝐷2, ..., 𝐷𝑁 }. And a pair of(𝑥, 𝑦) is\nan instance in one of the language documents𝐷𝑖.\nThe overall learning objective is maximizing the\nlikelihood of𝑦 given a corrupted𝐶(𝑥), that is\n∑\n𝐷𝑖∈𝐷\n∑\n(𝑥,𝑦)∈𝐷𝑖\nlog 𝑃 (𝑦|𝐶(𝑥)). (1)\n3.3 DOCmT5\nWe use mT5 as the backbone model. mT5 is a\nsequence-to-sequence language model pretrained\nwith the span corruption objective in which ran-\ndom spans in the input are masked and the decoder\nis required to reconstruct the masked spans (see\nRaffel et al. (2020) and Xue et al. (2021) for fur-\nther details). Our system,DOCmT5, incorporates\na second-stage pretraining with a structure-aware\ncross-lingual objective(3.2) on pseudo parallel doc-\numents. Detailed comparisons with previous mul-\ntilingual language models can be found in Table\n1. We provide two variants ofDOCmT5 with both\nBase and Large model settings:\n• DOCmT5-5 This model is pretrained with 5\nlanguages: {De, Ru, Tr, Vi and Es}. For all\nof the pretraining objective baselines in this\npaper, we pretrain with this set of languages,\nunless specified otherwise.\n• DOCmT5-25 This model is pretrained with\n25 languages. We show the full list of lan-\nguages and their sizes in Table 2.\n3.4 Implementation Details\nWeusemT5-Base 1 andmT5-Large2 checkpointsat\n1M steps as our pretrained models. We perform a\nsecond-stage of pretraining for an additional 0.5M\nsteps using batches of 256 examples each of max\nlength 1024. The learning rate is determined by\n1https://console.cloud.google.com/\nstorage/browser/t5-data/pretrained_\nmodels/mt5/base/\n2https://console.cloud.google.com/\nstorage/browser/t5-data/pretrained_\nmodels/mt5/large/\na inverse square root scheduler as defined in T5,\nwith the learning rate set to1∕\n√\n𝑛 where n is the\nnumber of training step. We use the same span\ncorruption objective as T5, with 15% of random\ntokens masked and an average noise span length of\n3. For finetuning, we use a constant learning rate\nof 0.001 and dropout rate of 0.1 for all tasks until\nconvergence. We adopt greedy decoding during\ninference.\n4 Experiments\n4.1 Baselines\n• Second-Stage Pretraining on 5 Languages\nLanguage models pretrained with huge num-\nbers of languages suffer from curse of multi-\nlinguality. In order to make a fair comparison,\nwe create a strong mT5 model by continuing\ntopretrainonthesame5languagesofmC4as\ninDOCmT5-5with the same number of steps\nusingtheoriginalspancorruptionobjectivein\nmT5. Models pretrained with this objective is\ndenoted ascont-5langs.\n• Monolingual Document Reordering (Dr)\nWe briefly mention this objective in Sec-\ntion3.2. We use the mC4 corpus for this pre-\ntraining objective. Models pretrained with\nthis objective is denoted asDr (Document\nReordering).\n• Document TLM (DocTLM)\nIn Conneau and Lample (2019), the au-\nthors propose the translation language model-\ning(TLM) objective, which concatenates par-\nallel sentences and applies masked language\nmodeling to learn cross-lingual knowledge.\nHere we extend it to the document level by\nconcatenating parallel documents. Instead of\nmaskingsingletokens,wefollowthespancor-\nruption objective in T5 and mask consecutive\nspans. The models are pretrained with this\nobjective on MTmC4.\n• Document NMT (DocNMT)\nWe consider a standard document-level ma-\nchine translation for pretraining. The source\ndocument is the input and the target transla-\ntion is the output. We use MTmC4 for this\npretraining objective.\n428\nPretrained Model Es-En Ru-En Tr-En Vi-En Average\nPrevious Systems\nmBART 38.30 / 15.40 / 32.4033.10 / 11.90 / 27.80 34.40 / 13.00 / 28.10 32.00 / 11.10 / 26.4034.45 / 12.85 / 28.67\nMono-Lingual\nmT5 29.97 / 10.65 / 25.70 27.91 / 8.90 / 22.60 29.98 / 11.96 / 24.56 24.38 / 7.39 / 19.59 28.06 / 9.72 / 23.11\nw. cont-5langs 34.50 / 12.83 / 28.37 30.20 / 10.30 / 24.77 32.12 / 13.71 / 26.40 28.95 / 9.74 / 23.7631.44 / 11.64 / 25.82\nw.

We use Wikilingua,\na cross-lingual summarization dataset, in which a\ndocument from an arbitrary language must be sum-\nmarizedinEnglish. WeadopttheGEM(Gehrmann\net al., 2021) version where the data is re-split to\navoid train-test overlap between languages. We use\na special prefix for cross-lingual summarization:\n\"Summarize X to Y\", where X and Y are the source\nand target language names respectively.\n4.2.1 Results on Seen Language Pairs\nWe show the finetuning results of language pairs\nthat are in the second stage of pretraining in Ta-\nble 3. We use the same four languages that are\nin Wikilingua’s original release {Es, Ru, Tr, Vi}.\nTheDr objective brings substantial improvements\novercont-5langs in all four languages, justifying\nthe importance of structure-aware objectives. As\nfor cross-lingual objectives,DocTLM is better than\nDocNMT in almost all languages except for Rus-\nsian. DOCmT5-5 substantially outperformsDoc-\nNMT andDocTLM, showing that our proposed pre-\ntraining objective leads to improved cross-lingual\nlearning. The results ofDOCmT5-25 are inferior\ntoDOCmT5-5 and this is possibly due to capacity\ndilution (Arivazhagan et al., 2019). As we increase\nthe capacity, we see thatDOCmT5-25-Large out-\nperforms DOCmT5-5-Large. DOCmT5-25-Large\nis the best overall model outperforming the strong\nprior system: mBART.\n4.2.2 Results on Unseen Language Pairs\nWe show the finetuning results of language pairs\nthat are not in the second-stage of pretraining stage\n429\nin Table 4. We use three languages {Fr, Id, Hi}3.\nOnce again, we see that theDr objective brings\nsubstantial improvements overcont-5langs. Sur-\nprisingly, without directly pretraining on the same\nlanguage pairs,DOCmT5-5 leads to substantial im-\nprovements over strong baselines. This shows that\nour pretraining objectives are able to generalize to\nother languages.DOCmT5-25 pretrains on French\nandHindibutnotIndonesianandhenceweobserve\nimprovements of average results overDOCmT5-5.\nThe improvements ofDOCmT5 are not so substan-\ntial and sometimes even hurt performance in high-\nresource languages: French and Indonesian, which\nhave 44556 and 33237 training examples respec-\ntively and there are only 6942 examples in Hindi.\nDOCmT5-25-Large obtains the best results in al-\nmost all 3 languages except for French.\nPretrained Model d-BLEU\nPrevious Systems\nNTT (Kiyono et al., 2020) 43.80\nPROMT (Molchanov, 2020) 39.60\nOPPO (Shi et al., 2020) 42.20\nMono-Lingual\nmT5 29.08\nw. cont-5langs 32.24\nw.

DOCmT5-5 isbetter\nthan DOCmT5-25 again because of capacity dilu-\ntion as noted in Aharoni et al. (2019).

Chinese is only in the first-\nstagepretrainingofmT5butnotinoursecond-stage\npretraining. We use parallel training data from\nIWSLT15 without using additional monolingual\ndata.

The results are in\n4For all the document translation experiments in this pa-\nper, the numbers are calculated using sacreBLEUhttps://\ngithub.com/mjpost/sacrebleu in document level.\n430\nTable 6.DOCmT5-5 outperforms the strong cross-\nlingual and mono-lingual baselines, demonstrat-\ning impressive transfer capability .DOCmT5-25\nincludes Chinese as one of the second-stage pre-\ntraining languages therefore obtains better num-\nbers thanDOCmT5-5. Unsurprisingly, large mod-\nels are better than their corresponding base models.\nTo the best of our knowledge,DOCmT5-25-Large\nachieves the SOTA on this task.

While the mono-\nlingual pretrained models completely fail to pro-\nducemeaningfultranslations, DOCmT5-5 isableto\nachieveover20BLEUpointsinDe-Enand15inRu-\nEn. Notsurprisingly,DOCmT5-5-Large furtherim-\nprovestoover35and29respectively. DOCmT5-25\nincludes Pl-En and Ja-En in the second-stage pre-\ntraining and therefore obtains competitive results\nonthesetwolanguagepairswitheitherbaseorlarge\nmodel. AlthoughDOCmT5-5 is not pretrained on\nPl-En, the large model gets over 14 BLEU on this\ntask. One hypothesis is that Polish uses the Latin\nscript and shares common subwords with German\nand Spanish, allowing our model to transfer knowl-\nedge across languages. On the other hand, the\nDOCmT5-5-Base model fails to produce meaning-\nful translations for Pl-En. This shows the impor-\ntance of size when performing multilingual pre-\ntraining. Thebestmodelis DocNMT whichobtains\nover 40 BLUE points in both De-En and Ru-En,\noutperformingDOCmT5-5 andDOCmT5-25.

Further analysis of the\nquality of this data will be an interesting avenue for\nfuture work.\n5 Analysis\n5.1 Are Document-level Models Better Than\nSentence-level Models?\nTo demonstrate the benefits of pretraining with\nlonger context, we pretrain mT5 using translation\nlanguage modeling (TLM) on five languages: {De,\nEs, Tr, Vi, Ru} with two different inputs. In\nDocTLM, we concatenate the parallel documents\ninto a single training sequence. As forSenTLM, we\nbreakdownthedocumentintoindividualsentences\nand find the alignments in the parallel document\npair. Then we concatenate the single aligned sen-\ntencepairasatrainingsequence.

We compare\nagainst the CCAligned corpus – a large automati-\ncally mined corpus from Common Crawl which is\nfound to be very noisy (Kreutzer et al., 2021). In\ncontrast,MTmC4isproducedbyusinghigh-quality\ntranslation systems.

Using our curated MTmC4\nis consistently better regardless of pretraining ob-\njectives or tasks.\n5.3 Does Combining Mono-Lingual and\nCross-Lingual Pretraining Help?\nHere we try to see if combining both monolingual\nand cross-lingual objectives helps. We try two dif-\nferent continual pretraining strategies for combin-\ningDrand DrMT.

The results are\nshown in Figure 5. After 50k steps of pretrain-\ning withDrMT, both systems outperform thecont-\n5langs. After 300k steps, both systems roughly\nconverge and perform similarly.\n6 Conclusion\nIn this paper, we present DOCmT5, a novel\ndocument-level multilingual pre-trained model.\nOur proposed objective, DrMT, is simple and\neffective and leads to large gains over strong\nbaselines (e.g. mBART and MARGE) on cross-\nlingual summarization and document-level transla-\ntion. DOCmT5achievedSOTAontwocompetitive\ndocument-level translation tasks: WMT20 De-En\n432\nand IWSLT15 Zh-En. We further analyze various\nfactorsthatcontributetosuccessfuldocument-level\npre-training. We plan to release the pre-trained\nmodel to facilitate future work on document-level\nlanguage understanding.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank Alexis Conneau, Jon Clark\nand Mihir Sanjay Kale for the helpful discussions.\nWe also thank Sebastian Ruder, Noah Constant\nand Ankur Bapna for providing feedback on the\nmanuscript.\nReferences\nRoee Aharoni, Melvin Johnson, and Orhan Firat. 2019.\nMassively multilingual neural machine translation.\nInProceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North\nAmerican Chapter of the Association for Computa-\ntional Linguistics: Human Language Technologies,\nVolume 1 (Long and Short Papers),pages3874–3884.\nNaveenArivazhagan,AnkurBapna,OrhanFirat,Dmitry\nLepikhin, Melvin Johnson, Maxim Krikun, Mia Xu\nChen, Yuan Cao, George Foster, Colin Cherry, et al.\n2019.

We demonstrate an example in\nTable 6. We take the best system (DOCmT5-25-\nLarge) and thecont-5langs baseline. We observe\nthat DOCmT5 uses time tenses better than the\nbaseline, producing more coherent sentences (red-\ncolored texts). Additionally,DOCmT5 handles a\ncompositional sentence more elegantly, instead of\njust using \"and\" (blue-colored texts). Finally, we\nobserve thatcont-5langs often makes minor trans-\nlation mistakes while ourDOCmT5 makes much\nfewer of them.\n436\n我 11 岁那年，  记得有一天早晨醒来，听见家里有愉悦的声音。  我的父亲在用他的灰色小收音机  听 BBC 新 \n闻。  他面带笑容，这很少见，  因为大部分的新闻都只会使他沮丧。  \" 塔利班走了！ \" 父亲大声叫着。  我不 \n知道那意味着什么，  但是我能看出父亲非常非常高兴。  \" 你现在可以去个真正的学校念书了。 \" 他说。  我永 \n远不会忘记那个早晨。  一个真正的学校。  我 6 岁那年，塔利班占领阿富汗  并规定女孩上学是违法的。  所以 \n在那之后 5 年，我女扮男装  陪着我姐姐去一个秘密学校  姐姐那时已经不被允许独自外出了。  这是我们俩人 \n唯一的受教育方式。  我们每天要走不同的路线  这样才没有人会怀疑我们要去哪里。 \n...\nAnd when I was 11 years old, I remember waking up one morning to the sound of a happy voice in the house. My\nfather was listening to the BBC on his little gray radio. He had a smile on his face, which is rare, because most of\nthe news was depressing. \"The Taliban are gone!\" My father shouted. I didn't know what that meant, but I could\nsee that my father was very, very happy. \"You can go to a real school now,\" he said. And I will never forget that\nmorning. A real school. When I was six years old, the Taliban occupied Afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to\ngo to school. So for the next five years, I was a woman in a man's suit and went to a secret school with my sister,\nwho was not allowed to go out alone. This was the only way we were educated. We had to go in different\ndirections every day so no one would suspect where we were going.\n...\nAnd I was 11 years old, and I remember awakefully waking up in the morning and hearing the familiar sound. My\nfather was listening to the BBC news on his little radio. He was smiling, and it was rare, because most of the news\nwas going to frustrate him. \"Taliban go.\" The father went out. I don't know what that meant, but I can see that the\nfather was very, very happy. \"You can go to a real school now.\" He said. I'll never forget that morning. A real\nschool. And I was six years old, and Taliban took Afghanistan and banned girls' schooling. So five years after that,\nmy chick went to a secret school with my sister. And she wasn't allowed to go on a trip. It was the only way that we\nwere educated. We walked on different roads every day so that nobody could suspect where we were.\n...\nWhen I was 11, I remember waking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house. My father was listening to\nBBC News on his small, gray radio. There was a big smile on his face which was unusual then, because the news\nmostly depressed him. \"The Taliban are gone!\" my father shouted. I didn't know what it meant, but I could see that\nmy father was very, very happy. \"You can go to a real school now,\" he said. A morning that I will never forget. A\nreal school. You see, I was six when the Taliban took over Afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school.\nSo for the next five years, I dressed as a boy to escort my older sister, who was no longer allowed to be outside\nalone, to a secret school. It was the only way we both could be educated. Each day, we took a different route so\nthat no one would suspect where we were going.  \n... \nSource \nDocument\nDOCmT5-25 \ntranslation \nmT5\ntranslation \nTarget  \nTranslation \nFigure6: AcomparisonexampleofZh-Endocumenttranslation.
