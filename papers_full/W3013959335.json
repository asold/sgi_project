Gutten et al.\nIntroduction\nCondition evaluation of insulating the high-\nvoltage oil transformers, particularly of oil conductivity \nand paper moisture, is becoming more significant for \naged power transformers and also for quality control \nof new equipment in the manufacturing factory. \nThe interest for reliable and easy to use measuring \nand diagnostic technique drove the development of \ndielectric time and frequency response methods [1, 2]. \nIt is necessary to know condition of transformer \ninsulation between dielectric elements and insulating \nproperties in operating state.\nThe first approach, called recovery voltage \nmethod (RVM – Figure 1), is nowadays already \nknown. The newer two methods, polarization and \ndepolarization currents (PDC) and frequency domain \nspectroscopy (FDS), demonstrated their suitability \nfor diagnostics of transformer and are now frequently \nused [3].\nThe advantage of these methods is that it is \npossible to detect moisture in paper insulation and \nconductivity in oil of power transformers.\nFigure 1 – Principal scheme of recovery voltage method \nTo prevent failure, it is necessary to analyse \nthe chemical processes in insulating oil and paper, \nas well as their impact on other components of oil \ntransformers too.\nChromatographic analysis of gases in insulating \noil belongs to the physic-chemical methods using \nof processes that occur due to negative thermal, \nelectrical or combined phenomena in the failure state \nof the machine insulation systems, which exhibit \nby production of gases, known as decomposition \ngases [4, 5].\nThese types of defects can occur at any time, and \nbecause it is an indirect method, allowing detection \nof gas generated, the challenge is assessed through \nthe composition and quantity of gas, the potential \nseverity of a fault condition of the transformer.\nThe basic diagnostics of transformers  \nby frequency domain spectroscopy method\nPrevious research works in condition \ndiagnostics of dialectical insulation have indicated \nthat the frequency domain spectroscopy can the \nmost effectively estimate deterioration in insulation \nof oil-paper in power transformer. Since especially \nthe low frequencies (to 0.1 Hz) reflect moisture \nconcentration, their measurement is of outmost \nimportance for reliable data analysis. Beside  \na frequency sweep, the response of a dielectric  \nto a voltage sweep is experimentally investigated \nand discussed [9].\nSpecial focus is given on a comparison of the \ncurrently available dielectric spectroscopy methods \nto traditional measurement techniques like dielectric \ndissipation factor (tgδ) tests at power frequency \nand 0.1 Hz, dielectric adsorption ratio and the \npolarization index. The traditional methods suffer \nfrom a limited time or frequency range which impedes \nthe discrimination of specific dielectric properties.  \nIf for example increased losses appear, it is impossible \nto discriminate whether they are caused by the \ninsulating oil or the cellulose paper insulation [6].\nApplying a sinus frequency sweep in wide range \nmeans to measurement the dielectric responses in \ndepending on quality transformer insulate [7].\nDielectric response of the whole insulation \nsystem in transformer depends on different factors \ni. e. on the properties of impregnated paper and \npressboard, on the properties of oil, and on the \ngeometrical arrangement of the system components \nand a correct evaluation of the measured data.  \nIn addition information is required about design \nof insulation system, i. e. the relative amounts  \nof pressboard barriers and spacers in relation to the \namount of oil.\nFor power transformers insulated oil-paper, the \ndielectric response consists of three components. \nThey are the response of the cellulose insulation \n(paper, pressboard), the response of the oil and \nthe interfacial polarization effect. Moisture, \ntemperature, insulation geometry, oil conductivity \nand conductive aging by-products influence the \ndielectric response [8].\nIn Figure 2 is showed the dissipation factor \nof pressboard having 1 % moisture content and \noil together with the interfacial polarization effect \n(insulation geometry). The frequency range of \n1000–10 Hz is dominated by the cellulose insulation, \nhowever also the measurement cables and the \n355\n\nDevices and Methods of Measurements\n2019, vol. 10, no. 4, pp. 353–359  \nM. Gutten et al.\nПриборы и методы измерений \n2019. – Т. 10, № 4. – С. 353–359\nM. Gutten et al.\n356\nconnection technique influence this region. Oil \nconductivity causes the steep slope at 1–0.01 Hz. \nDissolved conductive aging by-products, soot \nand high molecular weight acids increase the \noil conductivity and thus influence this area.  \nThe interfacial polarization (insulation geometry, \nratio of oil to pressboard) determines the local \nmaximum or “hump” at 0.003 Hz [9]. \nThe higher the ratio of oil to pressboard,  \nthe more dominating is this effect. Finally, the \nproperties of the cellulose appear again at the \nfrequencies below 0.0005 Hz, here reflecting \nmoisture, the manufacturing process and low \nmolecular weight acids. The frequency limits \ncorrespond to Figure 2, but will vary in a wide range \nwith moisture, oil conductivity, insulation geometry, \ntemperature and amount of conductive aging by-\nproducts. Moisture particularly increases the losses \nin the low frequency range of the dielectric response \nof pressboard. Thus, the point of inflexion on the \nleft hand side of the area dominated by insulation \ngeometry is required for a reliable moisture \ndetermination [9, 10].  \nMethod FDS is mainly used for oil-paper \ninsulation; it can also be used for dry transformers  \nor high-voltage equipment with ferrofluid in \nmagnetic field [7].\nFigure 2 – Analysis of insulating transformer properties \nby curve of frequency domain spectroscopy method\nAn experimental measurement was conducted \non traction single-phase transformer 110/27 kV, \nwhich is installed in high-voltage traction substation, \nfor moisture analysis by dielectric spectroscopy. \nMeasurement was conducted at temperature +15 °C \nwith transformer oil and –5 °C without oil.\nFor measuring was used apparatus the MEGGER \nIDAX-350 was used with the connection according to \nFigure 3, which works on the principle of dielectric \nspectroscopy (FDS method) by measuring the \npercentage loss factor, capacities and permittivity \ndepending at the frequency of 1 kHz up to 0.0001 Hz \nin the sinusoidal power supply 140 Vef.\nAt the first measurement with oil at +15 °C – the \ntotal isolation state of the transformer at 20 °C/50 Hz \nwas “good state” according to percentage dissipation \nfactor (tgδ  (%) = 0.25) and paper moisture \nwas “good state” (1.95 %) by the rating graphs  \nof measuring apparatus IDAX-350 (Figure 4).  \nAt the second measurement without oil at –5 °C in the \ncomparison – the total isolation state of the transformer \nat 20 °C/50 Hz was better according to tgδ (%) = 0.22 \nand paper moisture was better too (1.50 %). Capacity \nof insulating system was significantly smaller \n(Figure 4), because transformer oil is significant part \nof whole insulating transformer system.\nFigure 3 – Connection of the system MEGGER IDAX-350 \nto the measured single traction transformer 110/27 kV\nAccording to Figure 4 lower temperature causes \nshift of curve to lower frequencies (direction to the \nleft). This shift was the proof of the theory graph \nin Figure 2. Other impact was draining oil before \nthe second measurement, because was reduced \nconductivity of transformer oil for zero (conductivity \ndirection to left according to Figure 2).\nFigure 4 – Measured curves of transformer at different \nconditions by frequency domain spectroscopy method and \napparatus IDAX-350\n\nDevices and Methods of Measurements\n2019, vol. 10, no. 4, pp. 353–359\nM. Gutten et al.\nПриборы и методы измерений \n2019. – Т. 10, № 4. – С. 353–359\nM. Gutten et al.\nBecause measurement is performed at very \nlow currents, it is necessary consistently linking all \nconnections according to Figure 3. Since the device \nseparately distinguishes measurement of individual \ncapacities, it is necessary to thoroughly clean the \nlocation for connection of the ground conductor \nof the device. Poor connection results in errors in \ncurrent measure-ments (and then calculated value \nof percentage loss factor – tgδ (%)) at frequencies \nabove 200 Hz (Figure 5).\nFigure 5 – Measured curves of transformer at different \nconditions and poor/good ground by frequency domain \nspectroscopy method and apparatus IDAX-350\nComparison of insulating state of the several \nsame transformers\nIn the part of paper it is described experimental \nmeasurement of single-phase oil autotransformers \n231/121/10.6 kV, labeled R, S, T, Q, which \nare installed in power substation. It was used \nfrequency method FDS for analysis paper moisture, \nconductivity in oil and total state of insulating the \nautotransformers.\nTransformers were disconnected from the power \nsource and measured at the ambient temperature of \n16 °C. All calculations at 20 °C for the loss factor and \n25 °C for the conductivity of the transformer oil were \nperformed by the instrument MEGGER IDAX-350.\nIn this method it was measured parameters – the \npercentage loss factor, capacities and permittivity \ndepending on the frequency of 10 kHz up to 1 mHz \nin the sinusoidal power supply 140 Vef. \nMeasured real capacities and dissipation factor  \nin frequency dependence of measured autotransformer \n231/121/10.6 kV , designated R, S, T, Q are shown  \nin Figures 6 and 7.\nEvaluation and analysis measurement of \nthe individual autotransformers R, S, T, Q it was \nperformed by apparatus IDAX according to the rating \ntable (Table 1).\nTable 1\nBasic analyses by instrument IDAX-350\nAnalysis of transformer status results by IDAX\ntgδ (%) at \n50 Hz/20 °C\nMoisture in \npaper (%)\nConductivity  \nof the oil at 25 °C \n(pS/m)\n< 0.30 %\nAs new\n< 1.0 %\nAs new\n< 0.37 pS/m\nAs new\n0.30–0.50 %\nGood\n1.0–2.0 %\nDry\n< 0.37–3.7 pS/m\nGood\n0.50–1.0 %\nDeteriorated\n2.0–3.0 %\nModerately wet\n3.7–37 pS/m\nService aged\n> 1.0 %\nInvestigate\n> 3.0 %\nWet\n> 37 pS/m\nDeteriorated\nFigure 6 – Comparison of measured autotransformers \nR, S, T, Q according to the real capacities for connection \nhigh-voltage winding – tank CHT\nFigure 7 – Comparison of measured autotransformers \nR, S, T, Q according to the percentage dissipation factor \n(tgδ (%)) dependence on frequency\nThe total isolation state at 20 °C/50 Hz was \n“good state” according to the rating table of the \n357\n\nDevices and Methods of Measurements\n2019, vol. 10, no. 4, pp. 353–359  \nM.

Transformer Q showed a slightly higher \nvalue loss factor tgδ (%) = 0.413 %.\nTable 2\nComparison of values for autotransformers  \nR, S, T, Q\nMeasured Results of transformers by IDAX\nTrans- \nformers\ntgδ (%) at \n50 Hz/20 °C\nMoisture \nin paper \n(%)\nConductivity \nof the oil at\n25 °C (pS/m)\nR 0.323 1.9 0.43\nS 0.380 2.3 3.44\nT 0.381 2.4 1.36\nQ 0.413 3 3.28\nThe insulation state (conductivity) of the oil at \n25 °C of the R, S, T, Q autotransformers was good \naccording to the oil conductivity table. Temperature \nat 25 °C is standard for investigation and comparison \nother transformer oils.\nAt compared to these transformers, the best \n(lowest) value of the relative conductivity of the oil \nwas in autotransformer R(0.43 pS/m). Transformers \nS, T and Q had oil values from 1.36 to 3.44 pS/m \n(Table 2).\nThe moisture of paper in the individual \nautotransformers R, S, T, Q was different according \nto the rating table. When comparing all four \ntransformers, the best (lowest) value of the moisture \nstate in the paper showed the transformer R(1.9 %), \nwhich according to the evaluation table is dry. \nAutotransformers S and T had approximately \nthe same humidity value (2.3–2.4 %), which \naccording to the rating table is slightly humid.  \nThe last autotransformer Q had the highest humidity \nvalue (3 %), which, according to the rating table,  \nis the mild to wet boundary between the conditions.\nBased on the above-mentioned analysis of the \nmeasured values, it is possible to confirm that in \nthe autotransformer T, which is currently used as \na reserve; most of the moisture is deposited in the \npaper portion of the insulation. This corresponds to \nan oil conductivity value of 1.36 pS/m.\nFrom the measured values, it is possible for the \nautotransformer T to estimate that during operation, \nthe conductivity value of the oil would be higher \nthan that of the autotransformers S and Q, which \nmeans that before it is put into full operation, it will \nbe necessary to take action to reduce the moisture \nstate of the autotransformer isolation system T.\nThe analysis further confirms that the oil in the R \ntransformer has undergone total regeneration a year \nbefore the measurement. The moisture content and \noil conductivity values confirm the excellent state for \nthe power class and the size of the autotransformers \nto be measured.\nA slightly higher oil conductivity value in the S \nautotransformer may indicate a higher load than the \nQ transformer. However, the analysis revealed that \nthe moisture content of the Q transformer is highest \namong the other measured units, but this also means \na higher susceptibility to the overcurrent failure \n(Figure 8). \nFigure 8 – Table comparison of measured autotrans-\nformers R, S, T, Q according to the moisture in paper (%) \nand oil conductivity (pS/m)\nConclusion\nExperimental measurements have shown a \ncorrelation between the measured values and the \noperational aspects of the individual transformers.  \nIt has been shown that the biggest danger for insulation \nof oil transformers is their shutdown from operation \n(the highest moisture of paper in transformer Q).\nTo confirm or disprove the results of spectrum \nspectroscopy analysis, it would be useful to also analyze \nthe dissolved gas in the oil of the autotransformers \nmeasured for the presence of CO\n2 and CO gases,  \nthe amount of which is mainly influenced by \nthe cellulose quality and possible leakage of the \nautotransformer vessel. Despite the accuracy of the \nmeasuring device, it would be useful to compare the \nloss factors with the higher measuring instrument.\n358\n\nDevices and Methods of Measurements\n2019, vol. 10, no. 4, pp. 353–359\nM.
