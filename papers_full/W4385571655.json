Based on\nthe latest news returned by Google Search, T5-LARGE\ncan answer the question correctly.\ndatasets (usually fixed once collected), which are\nneither up-to-date nor complete (Komeili et al.,\n2021; Ji et al., 2022). Although model scal-\ning (Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al., 2022;\nThoppilan et al., 2022) is a viable way to improve\nthe knowledge capacity of PLMs, it still uses static\npretraining datasets, and also leads to significantly\nlarger computational costs with increased model\nsizes. As a result, the outdated or incomplete\nknowledge encoded by PLMs may lead to hallu-\ncination or incorrect generations even though the\nresults look plausible (Ji et al., 2022).\nRecently, by drawing the idea from semi-\nparametric approaches (Zhao et al., 2022; Guu\net al., 2020; Lewis et al., 2020b; Borgeaud et al.,\n2022), retrieval-augmented approaches have been\nproposed to equip PLMs with the ability to directly\naccess an external database. As a major knowledge\nresource, Wikipedia has been widely used in pre-\nvious work. While being highly accurate and well-\nstructured, Wikipedia only covers limited informa-\ntion, both in scope and in time. Besides, even for\n728\nthe topics that Wikipedia covers, grounding PLMs’\ndecisions on a single source of knowledge may\ncreate biases (Wagner et al., 2016). Considering\nthese issues, it is time to look beyond Wikipedia (or\nsimilar single-source databases) and access more\nbroader, in-depth, and up-to-date knowledge from\nmore sources. Inspired by (Komeili et al., 2021;\nPiktus et al., 2021), we select the web as the re-\ntrieval resource for enlarging the knowledge capac-\nity of PLMs. To motivate our approach, Table 1\npresents a sample question that T5 successfully an-\nswers with the support of the web (providing the\nlatest news), but not Wikipedia. As we can see,\ntimely and relevant supporting evidence is the key\nto solve such tasks for PLMs.\nIn this paper, we aim to capitalize on the web as a\nsource of up-to-date and comprehensive knowledge\nto solve a wide range of knowledge-intensive tasks.\nUnlike previous web-augmented studies (Nakano\net al., 2021; Menick et al., 2022) that mostly fo-\ncus on single tasks, we seek to develop a unified\nframework to integrate the use of the web in PLMs\nfor multi-task solving. Although the idea of lever-\naging the web for improving PLMs is appealing,\nit is non-trivial to develop an effective solution.\nFirst, PLMs do not always need external evidence\nfor task solving, especially considering the fact\nthat the web contains noisy, biased, or harmful in-\nformation (Luccioni and Viviano, 2021). Simply\nretrieving knowledge without considering the ex-\nample difficulty and PLMs’ own capabilities may\nsteer models towards unexpected outputs. Second,\nPLMs are usually pretrained at an earlier time on a\nlimited corpus, leading to a discrepancy between\nthe encoded knowledge and the retrieved knowl-\nedge (i.e., web contents). Therefore, we need more\nprincipled approaches to properly integrating the\nnew knowledge into PLMs.\nTo address the above issues, we present a web-\naugmented PLMs, UNIWEB, to improve the ca-\npacity in knowledge-intensive tasks. Instead of\nusing neural network-based retriever, we employ\na commercial search engine (i.e., Google Search)\nto obtain high-quality and comprehensive retrieval\nresults from the web. Based on this idea, we make\ntwo major technical contributions. First, we pro-\npose a search engine assisted learning method that\ncan selectively query the web only when PLM is\nunconfident in its predictions. For this purpose,\nwe design a self-evaluation mechanism to estimate\nthe confidence level of PLMs on the task exam-\nples. Secondly, to reduce the discrepancy between\nthe encoded and retrieved knowledge, we design\na pretraining task, continual knowledge learning,\nto integrate the retrieved knowledge into PLMs by\npredicting the salient masked spans in web docu-\nments. To train the UNIWEB model, we convert\ndifferent knowledge-intensive tasks into a unified\ntext-to-text format, and conduct supervised multi-\ntask training over 16 tasks across seven categories.\nTo the best of our knowledge, our model is the\nfirst unified web-augmented PLM for a wide range\nof knowledge-intensive tasks. Extensive experi-\nments show that PLMs can significantly benefit\nfrom such an approach and a single unified PLM\n(UNIWEB) is able to achieve (near) state-of-the-art\nperformance on all 16 tasks.\n2 Related Work\nRetrieval-Augmented PLMs. Augmenting a pre-\ntrained language model with retrieval has been ex-\ntensively studied in existing literature (Lewis et al.,\n2020b; Borgeaud et al., 2022; Izacard et al., 2022;\nLee et al., 2019; Guu et al., 2020). For example,\nREALM (Guu et al., 2020) and RAG (Lewis et al.,\n2020b), incorporate a differentiable retriever into\npretrained models, leading to promising results on\nquestion answering. However, these studies usually\nrely on a sub-optimal retriever to access a static\nand limited knowledge resource, i.e., Wikipedia.\nBy contrast, our model utilizes the well-developed\nsearch engine to gain broader, more in-depth, and\nup-to-date knowledge from the web. Several stud-\nies have also looked at how Internet can help the\nmodels, but only focus on single tasks such as ques-\ntion answering (Nakano et al., 2021; Menick et al.,\n2022) and dialogue (Komeili et al., 2021). We-\nbGPT (Nakano et al., 2021) uses human feedback\nto optimize answer quality by hiring massive label-\ners to judge the accuracy of answers. Komeili et al.\n(2021) retrieves knowledge from the web for every\ndialogue without considering the necessity. Piktus\net al. (2021) only presents an empirical study to in-\nvestigate the impact of replacing Wikipedia with a\nlarge-scale web-like corpus and adopting different\nretrieval models. We are also aware of some related\nstudies (Jiang et al., 2023), but we have taken a dif-\nferent active approach for knowledge retrieval. In\nthis paper, we develop a unified language model for\nsolving a wide spectrum of knowledge-intensive\ntasks. Our model can selectively decide whether\nto access the web, and continuously learn from the\n729\nSelf-Evaluation\nRetrieve?\nCommonsense \nReasoning\nCommonsense QA\nSlot \nFilling\nDialogue Fact \nChecking\nNatural Language \nInference\nThe football manager who \nrecruited David Beckham \nmanaged Manchester United \nduring what timeframe?\n1995-96 Manchester \nUnited F.C. season\nThe 1995 -96 season was \nManchester United's fourth \nseason in the Premier League \n.....

Recent work\nhas shown that PLMs’ parameters have implic-\nitly stored linguistic or factual knowledge (Petroni\net al., 2019; Roberts et al., 2020). However, the\nimplicitly encoded knowledge is limited by the\nmodel’s scale and training data, contradicting the\ndynamic nature of the world. Hence, many re-\nsearchers propose to fuse relevant external knowl-\nedge from texts with the encoded knowledge of\nPLMs to deal with knowledge-intensive tasks such\nas open-domain QA (Guu et al., 2020; Lewis et al.,\n2020b), entity linking (Wu et al., 2019), fact veri-\nfication (Liu et al., 2019b), and commonsense rea-\nsoning (Lin et al., 2020). Wikipedia has been the\nmost widely used knowledge source for these tasks,\nwhich is still limited despite its wide coverage. In-\nstead, we rely on the real-time web. The existing\nstudies usually design task-specific training, archi-\ntecture, and knowledge fusion method to exploit\nknowledge sources. In this work, we aim to de-\nvelop a single unified framework that can be used\nfor most knowledge-intensive tasks.\n3 Task Formulation\nKnowledge-intensive tasks (Yin et al., 2022) aim\nto leverage external knowledge resources to accom-\nplish a broad range of tasks such as open-domain\nquestion answering and fact verification.\nFollowing prior work (Lewis et al., 2020b; Guu\net al., 2020), we employ a retrieval-augmented gen-\neration framework that consists of two components:\na retriever Rand a generator G. Given an input\ntext Xsuch as a question, the retriever Rlearns to\nretrieve a set of top-Kpassages P= {p1,...,p K}\nfrom a knowledge resource. Conditioned on the\ninput text Xand the retrieved passages P, the gen-\nerator Gaims to generate the output text Y. The\nmodel is trained to maximize the joint likelihood:\nPr(Y|X) =\n∑\nR,G\nPr(P|X)Pr(Y|P,X). (1)\nTo implement the framework, previous studies\nusually adopt a trainable neural retriever based on a\n(single) knowledge resource such as Wikipedia or\nknowledge bases. However, such an approach can\nonly access limited, static knowledge. In this paper,\nwe rely on a general, off-the-shelf search engine\nas the retriever to access both comprehensive and\nup-to-date knowledge from the whole web.\n4 Approach\nOur proposed web-augmented PLM, UNIWEB, is\ndepicted in Figure 1. We first transform knowledge-\nintensive tasks into a unified text-to-text paradigm\nand consider the web as a general form of knowl-\nedge source. Based on the retrieved knowledge, we\nfurther design two training objectives to build our\nmodel. In the next sections, we will describe our\nmethod in detail.\n4.1 Knowledge-Intensive Tasks Unification\nPrevious retrieval-augmented approaches usually\nadopt diverse architectures and different types of\nknowledge resources (Yin et al., 2022). Instead,\nwe aim to leverage the general knowledge source\n(i.e., the web) to develop a unified framework that\ncan fulfill various (or most) knowledge-intensive\ntasks. Specifically, we unify 16 typical knowledge-\nintensive tasks across 7 task families, including fact\nchecking, slot filling, dialogue, open-domain ques-\ntion answering, commonsense question answering,\ncommonsense reasoning, and natural language in-\nference. We convert these tasks as a general text-\nto-text transformation for training a unified PLM.\n730\nThese tasks are mainly from the studies (Petroni\net al., 2020; Piktus et al., 2021), in which the orig-\ninal tasks of fact checking, slot filling, dialogue,\nand open-domain QA are designed specifically\nbased on the retrieved knowledge from Wikipedia,\nwhile other tasks of commonsense QA, common-\nsense reasoning, and natural language inference\nfocus on some more specific commonsense knowl-\nedge, going beyond Wikipedia. We consider these\nknowledge-intensive tasks as typical NLP tasks to\nshow that the large-scale web can be specially use-\nful for satisfying diverse information needs. More\ndetails about each task can be found in Appendix A.\n4.2 Web-based Knowledge Retrieval\nUnlike prior work that retrieves documents from\noffline corpora such as Wikipedia (Guu et al.,\n2020; Lewis et al., 2020b), we propose to retrieve\ncomprehensive and up-to-date information from\nthe online web through a general-purpose search\nengine. Although it is intuitive to extend the\nretrieval-augmented framework with the web as the\nknowledge resource, it is non-trivial to effectively\nleverage the knowledge found on the web. The\ndocuments on the web have inconsistent quality,\nand contain noisy, biased, or even harmful con-\ntents (Luccioni and Viviano, 2021). Low-quality\ncontent may steer PLMs towards seemingly plausi-\nble but factually incorrect outputs (Ji et al., 2022).\nOn the other hand, compared to a local neural re-\ntriever, black-box search engines can only be ac-\ncessed through queries, which is less controllable\nand not easy to filter out noisy contents from the\nsearch results. In addition, PLMs do not always\nneed external knowledge for task solving, espe-\ncially for easy tasks. Therefore, we should request\nfor more knowledge only when needed.\n4.2.1 PLM Knowledge Evaluation\nTo address the above challenges, it is essential to\nevaluate PLMs’ own capabilities in a task and the\nnecessity to refer to external knowledge. In our\napproach, we consider a non-trivial question before\nretrieval: does a PLM need to retrieve knowledge\nfor a specific task instance? For this purpose, we in-\nvestigate whether or not PLMs can correctly answer\nquestions without using external evidence. Ac-\ncording to the recent study (Kadavath et al., 2022),\nPLMs can self-evaluate the confidence level of their\ngeneration results (e.g., True or False). Hence, we\npropose to utilize the self-evaluation mechanism to\ndetermine whether it is necessary to access addi-\ntional web information.\nSelf-Evaluation. Specifically, we hypothesize that\nwhen a model “knows” the true output (i.e., confi-\ndent about its output) for a specific input, sampling\nthe outputs many times would result in an output\ndistribution with small entropy. Following Kada-\nvath et al. (2022), we sample n(n= 200) different\noutputs for each input and estimate the entropy of\nthe output distribution as follows:\nH( ˆY|X) = E[−log Pr( ˆY|X)] (2)\n= E\n\n−\n∑\nwi∈ˆY\nlog Pr(wi|X,w<i)\n\n,\nwhere ˆY= ⟨w1,...,w i,...,w m⟩is the output text\ngenerated by the model G. Then, we set an entropy\nthreshold η. If H( ˆY|X) is higher than η, it means\nthat the model is unconfident about its outputs and\nneeds supporting evidence from the web, otherwise,\nit does not. We will further demonstrate the pre-\ndictive power of the entropy (Eq. (2)) in estimating\nthe model confidence for knowledge retrieval.\n4.2.2 Web Knowledge Retrieval\nIn active learning (Ren et al., 2021), a prediction\nmodel can interactively query for labeling exam-\nples with low confidence levels. This learning\nmethod can not only reduce the cost of data la-\nbeling, but also remove those noisy and unhelpful\ndata that models cannot benefit from. Inspired by\nthis, we propose a search engine assisted learning\napproach, in which PLMs choose those hard cases\nthat they cannot solve (assessed by self-evaluation)\nto query the off-the-shelf search engine for knowl-\nedge retrieval. Different from active learning, our\napproach does not directly query for the final an-\nswer (largely reducing the labeling efforts), but\ninstead the supporting evidence for solving the\ntask. After retrieving knowledge from the web,\nit is critical to filter out noisy contents and select\nthe most helpful and relevant knowledge that can\nenhance PLMs’ confidence to generate correct out-\nputs. Therefore, we elaborate a two-stage filter\nmechanism to filter the retrieved knowledge.\nSearch Engine Assisted Learning. Specifically,\nfor those hard examples, we take their input text\nX verbatim as a search query and issue a call\nto Google Search via API. For each query, we\nretrieve top-K HTML pages and parse them to\nobtain clean texts, resulting in a set of passages\n731\nP= {p1,...,p K}. To filter out noisy and irrele-\nvant information, in the first stage, we chunk each\npassage into paragraphs, compute the cosine sim-\nilarity between input and paragraph embeddings,\nand select the five most relevant paragraphs to form\nthe final passage. In the second stage, we adopt the\nsame method as self-evaluation (Eq. 2) to compute\nthe model confidence given the input and each pro-\ncessed passage and select those passages with high\nconfidence as the final evidence.\n4.3 Knowledge-based Model Pretraining\nIn most previous work, the retrieval model is either\npretrained using self-supervised objective such as\nMLM (Guu et al., 2020; Borgeaud et al., 2022)\nor trained for specific tasks (Lewis et al., 2020b).\nIn this work, we focus on explicitly training web-\naugmented PLMs in a supervised and massively\nmulti-task fashion (Aribandi et al., 2022) using the\nmixture of knowledge-intensive tasks (Section 4.1).\nBesides, to integrate the retrieved knowledge into\nPLMs, we design a continual knowledge learning\ntask based on the retrieved passages.\nKnowledge-Intensive Learning. This pretraining\nobjective uses the retrieved knowledge and labeled\ndata from the unified knowledge-intensive tasks.\nFormally, given an input textXand retrieved pas-\nsages P, this objective is to minimize the negative\nlog-likelihood loss over the output text Y:\nLKIL = −\nm∑\ni=1\nlog Pr(wi|w<i,X,P), (3)\nwhere wi denotes the i-th token of the output textY.\nWe concatenate the input text Xand retrieved pas-\nsages Pusing the manually-written task-specific\nprompts (shown in Appendix A). Pretrained on the\nunified knowledge-based text-to-text format, our\nmodel can be easily applied to diverse knowledge-\nintensive tasks. It has been reported that ensem-\nbling many tasks, distributions and domains during\npretraining can improve PLMs’ generalization to\nnew tasks (Aribandi et al., 2022).\nContinual Knowledge Learning. Due to the lim-\nited pretraining on single static corpus, the knowl-\nedge encoded in PLMs has a discrepancy with the\nretrieved knowledge from the web. Thus, to reduce\nthe discrepancy and integrate the newly retrieved\nknowledge into PLMs, we design a self-supervised\npretraining task, i.e., continual knowledge learning.\nFor most knowledge-intensive tasks such as slot\nfilling and fact verification, named entities are of\nspecial importance. Thus, this pretraining task aims\nto predict the salient masked spans ( i.e., named\nentities) in retrieved passages. Firstly, we use a\nBERT-based (Devlin et al., 2019) tagger trained on\nCoNLL-2003 data (Sang and De Meulder, 2003) to\nidentify name entities and then mask entities such\nas “United States”. Then, our model will be trained\nto predict these masked spans by minimizing the\nmasked span prediction loss:\nLCKL = −\nK∑\nk=1\nm∑\nj=1\nlog Pr(sj|˜pk), (4)\nwhere sj is the j-th masked span for the passage\npk, and ˜pk denotes the unmasked tokens in pk.\n5 Experiments\nIn this section, we detail the experimental setup and\nthen highlight the main observations of our results.\n5.1 Experimental Setup\nKnowledge Source. In large-scale pretraining, we\nleverage an open massive web corpus CCNet (Wen-\nzek et al., 2020) to provide documents with diverse\ntopics, approximating the realistic web. Following\nPiktus et al. (2021), we select the CCNet snapshot\ncorresponding to the August 2019 Common Crawl\nsnapshot which covers a wide range of 134M web\ndocuments and finally yields 906M passages of 100\ntokens. CCNet processes Common Crawl through\ndeduplication, language identification and quality\nfiltering based on perplexity calculated by a lan-\nguage model. In downstream fine-tuning, we test\nwith the off-the-shelf search engine, i.e., Google\nSearch, to retrieve documents from the real-time\nweb. Specifically, we utilize the input text verbatim\nas query and request a call to Google Search via\nAPI1. Besides, for the Wikipedia-based baselines,\nwe use the 2019/08/01 Wikipedia snapshot from\nthe KILT benchmark (Petroni et al., 2020), consist-\ning of 5.9M documents split into 22.2M passages\nof 100 tokens. This data snapshot is temporally the\nclosest to the CCNet corpus for fair comparison.\nPretraining Tasks. As described in Section 4.1,\nwe unify 16 knowledge-intensive tasks across seven\ntask families during pretraining:\n• Fact Checking: FEVER (Thorne et al., 2018).\n1https://developers.google.com/custom-search\n732\nModels\nFact Checking Slot Filling Dialogue Open-domain QA\nFEVER T-REx zsRE WoW NQ HotpotQA TriviaQA ELI5\nw/o Retrieval\nBARTLARGE 78.93 45.06 9.14 12.86 21.75 15.37 32.39 20.55\nT5LARGE 80.31 50.63 10.34 12.67 28.50 18.98 35.90 20.60\nw/ Wikipedia\nREALM 76.22 53.35 39.38 - 40.40 22.23 65.44 10.23\nRAG 86.31 59.20 44.74 13.11 44.39 26.97 71.27 14.05\nBART+DPR 86.74 59.16 30.43 15.19 41.27 25.18 58.55 17.41\nBART+DPRMULTI 86.32 78.50 57.95 15.33 39.75 31.77 59.60 17.07\nFID+DPRMULTI 88.99 82.19 71.53 15.66 49.86 36.90 71.04 16.45\nw/ CCNet\nFID+DPRMULTI 85.74 52.06 28.47 15.22 45.15 27.29 67.49 16.14\nFID+DPRCCN ET 87.43 57.02 36.55 15.29 48.61 31.64 73.06 15.76\nFID+BM25 89.12 62.12 43.92 17.28 46.05 34.10 78.21 15.59\nw/ Web\nUniWeb 91.69 83.58 72.42 20.87 54.37 40.73 77.01 18.34\nTable 2: Evaluation results on the test set for fact checking, slot filling, dialogue, and open-domain QA.

We take the input text as query to retrieve\ntop 10 passages from CCNet. After pre-processing,\nwe mix the training set of these datasets to pretrain\nour model. We present the statistics of datasets and\npre-processing details in Appendix A.\nBaselines. We compare UniWeb to a wide range\nof models as follows:\n• BART (Lewis et al., 2020a) and T5 (Raffel et al.,\n2020). These are two representative text-to-text\nPLMs for solving knowledge-intensive tasks. We\nadopt the large version for a fair comparison.\n• REALM (Guu et al., 2020) and RAG (Lewis\net al., 2020b). They are two well-known retrieval-\naugmented PLMs combining with a nonparamet-\nric memory of Wikipedia via a neural retriever.\n• Fusion-in-Decoder (FID) (Izacard and Grave,\n2020). It is based on T5 where the encoder en-\ncodes the input text with each passage and the\ndecoder combines the encoded representations.\n• Maillard et al. (2021) and Piktus et al. (2021)\nequip BART and FID with retrieval models,i.e.,\nBM25 (Robertson et al., 2009), DPR (Karpukhin\net al., 2020), DPRMULTI trained in a multi-task\nfashion, and DPRCCN ET trained on CCNet.\nNote that these models are trained on individual\ntasks and datasets, while our model is pretrained in\na multi-task manner. We use BM25 to retrieve pas-\nsages from CCNet during pretraining. The BM25\nand DPR indices are collected from the previous\nword (Piktus et al., 2021). Since it lacks the re-\ntrieval supervision to train DPR for those tasks in\nTable 3, we only report the BM25 results. The\nimplementation details are shown in Appendix B.\nEvaluation Metrics. We adopt various tasks and\ndatasets in our experiments, which need to be eval-\nuated differently. Following Petroni et al.

To compute EM and F1-score, we conduct\npost-processing on the gold and predicted output\ntexts such as lowercasing, stripping, punctuation,\nand duplicate whitespace (Rajpurkar et al., 2016).\n5.2 Main Results\nTable 2 and Table 3 show the results ofUNIWEB\nand baselines on 16 knowledge-intensive tasks.\nFirst, on almost all knowledge-intensive tasks,\ncombining PLMs with explicit retrieved knowledge\ncan achieve higher performance. From Wikipedia\nand CCNet to the web, we can observe that a\nbroader coverage of knowledge will lead to better\nresults. Compared to BART and T5, retrieval-based\nmodels benefit from the retrieved knowledge.\nSecond, the tasks in Table 2 are specially de-\nsigned based on the knowledge from Wikipedia.\nThus, there is a strong bias towards Wikipedia as\nthe knowledge resource. We can observe that CC-\nNet only achieves comparable results or even suf-\nfers from a large performance drop. However, for\nthe tasks in Table 3 requiring knowledge beyond\nWikipedia, CCNet is more competitive.\nFinally, our UNIWEB model achieves the best\nresults on most knowledge-intensive tasks. On one\nhand, our model is trained in a multi-task manner,\nwhich can benefit from knowledge sharing across\ntasks. On the other hand, our model can access\nbroad and up-to-date knowledge from the web via\nthe fine-tuned search engine.

More-\nover, the search engine works much better than\ntraditional sub-optimal retrieval methods that rely\non end-to-end training or word matching.\n5.3 Detailed Analysis\nWe report detailed analysis of UniWeb in several\ndatasets – we have similar finding in other datasets.\nAblation Study. Our UNIWEB model is the first\nunified PLM using the web as knowledge source\nfor knowledge-intensive tasks. To examine the im-\nportance of the web, we design two counterparts:\n(1) w/ Wikipedia or (2) w/ CCNet replaces the web\nwith Wikipedia or CCNet and adopts BM25 to\nretrieve documents. Besides, to avoid the nega-\ntive impact of noisy and biased information, we\nadopt the self-evaluation method to adaptively ac-\ncess knowledge from the web. Thus, we remove\nthis method to test its effect (w/o SE). Finally, we\nremove the pretraining task, i.e., continuous knowl-\nedge learning, to test its importance ( w/o CKL).\nThe results are shown in Table 4. We can see that\nreplacing the web with Wikipedia or CCNet suffers\nfrom a large performance drop.

The pretraining task also\nimproves the knowledge capacity of our model.\nSensitivity Analysis. In the self-evaluation mecha-\nnism, we use entropy to evaluate the model confi-\ndence. To verify its effectiveness, we present the\ndistribution of H( ˆY|X) depending on whether or\nnot the model gets the question correct. As shown\nin Figure 2(a), the average entropy of the questions\nfor which our model gets correct is lower than that\nof questions for which our model gets incorrect.\nThis indicates that the entropy has some predictive\npower of model confidence. Besides, the quality of\nretrieved documents will largely affect the predic-\ntion of our model. Thus, in Figure 2(b), we test the\nmodel accuracy by varying the top-Ksearch results\nin the set of {1-5, 6-10, 11-15, 16-20}. We can see\nthat PLM performance drops with the increase of\nrank of documents, thus the decrease of document\nquality. However, the retrieved top 6-10 passages\nalso achieve comparable results to the top 1-5 ones.\nThis is the motivation of our setting K = 10.\n5.4 Case Study\nIn this section, we perform the qualitative analysis\non REALTIME QA (Kasai et al., 2022), a bench-\nmark requiring real-time, up-to-date, and compre-\nhensive knowledge with a broad range of topics\n(such as politics, business, sports, and entertain-\nment) to solve questions. The evaluation results\nare shown in Appendix C. Our UniWeb model with\nGoogle Search performs the best. We present an ex-\nample in Table 5 about “World Cup final 2022” in\nthe sports topic. By using the question text as query,\nwe can retrieve top-1 passages from Wikipedia,\nCCNet, and web. Since Wikipedia and CCNet are\nboth static and limited knowledge resources, the\nretrieved passages are not fresh in time (“2014”\nand “2018”) even though they are on the same\ntopic “World Cup”. The typical retrieval methods\n(BM25 or DPR) are largely reliant on fuzzy se-\nmantic matching, also leading to incorrect retrieval.\nWhile, retrieving from the web using search engine\ncan ensure our model to obtain the most up-to-date\nand relevant information, based on which it can\ngenerate the correct answer “Croatia and Morocco”.\nWe present more examples in Appendix D.\n6 Conclusion\nThis paper presented a unified web-augmented\nframework for a wide range of knowledge-intensive\ntasks, called UNIWEB. We convert 16 tasks into\na text-to-text generation task for training. We pro-\npose a search engine assisted learning method to se-\nlectively retrieve documents from the web through\nGoogle Search. Furthermore, to reduce the discrep-\nancy between the encoded and retrieved knowledge,\n735\nwe design a pretraining task, i.e., continual knowl-\nedge learning, to integrate the retrieved knowledge\ninto LLMs. Experiments on 16 tasks show the ef-\nfectiveness of our web-augmented model compared\nto previous retrieval-augmented models. In future\nwork, we will investigate the effect of web content\nin detail and consider applying our model to more\ntypes of downstream tasks.\n7 Limitations\nFor web-augmented models including our work,\nthe deterioration of search results from search\nengine highlights the importance of deriving an\neffective method to interact with the huge web.\nSearch engines are often perceived as black-box\nand non-transparent for end users. Therefore, many\nworks proposed “leaning to search” to decompose\ncomplex questions into simpler queries, which\nmay improve the performance of web-based mod-\nels (Nakano et al., 2021; Komeili et al., 2021).\nIn our model, we used a commercial search en-\ngine as the retriever to work with the whole web\nas a knowledge source. Since the web is not cu-\nrated and well-structured like Wikipedia, we may\nencounter unexpected safety issues, including mis-\ninformation and harmful contents. While we have\nrelied on the security control of the search engine,\nmore attention should be paid to better understand\nthe risks and provide effective ways to mitigate\nthem. We hope our simple approach and strong\nresults could encourage more future work by the\ncommunity to tackle these questions. To encour-\nage the community to investigate the question and\nensure reproducibility, after the reviewing process,\nwe will release the search URLs used in our exper-\niments.\nAs for the potential concern, since we use the\nsearch engine to access real-time information, we\ndo not have a tight control over retrieved results as\ntraditional end-to-end retrieval (Guu et al., 2020;\nLewis et al., 2020b). Not only the changes of search\nengine logic, but also the newly published infor-\nmation, might create discrepancies over the course\nof time. This is also an issue we have to tackle to\nbuild a stable web-based solution for PLMs.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was partially supported by National\nNatural Science Foundation of China under Grant\nNo. 62222215 and 72222022, Beijing Natural Sci-\nence Foundation under Grant No. 4222027, Bei-\njing Outstanding Young Scientist Program under\nGrant No. BJJWZYJH012019100020098, and the\nOutstanding Innovative Talents Cultivation Funded\nPrograms 2021 of Renmin University of China.\nXin Zhao is the corresponding author.\nReferences\nVamsi Aribandi, Yi Tay, Tal Schuster, Jinfeng Rao,\nHuaixiu Steven Zheng, Sanket Vaibhav Mehta, Hon-\nglei Zhuang, Vinh Q.

The appendix is orga-\nnized into three sections:\n• Details of pretraining tasks are presented in\nAppendix A;\n• Model architecture and pretraining details are\npresented in Appendix B;\n• Supplementary experiments are presented in\nAppendix C;\n• Examples with retrieved knowledge are pre-\nsented in Appendix D.\nA Pretraining Tasks\nAs described in Section 4.1, to pretrain our model,\nwe unify 16 knowledge-intensive tasks across seven\ncategories into a general text-to-text format:\n• Fact checking is the task of assessing whether a\nnatural language claim is true (Guo et al., 2022).\nIt requires deep knowledge about the claim. We\nconsider the claim as input and the classification\nlabel (e.g., true/false) as output.\n• Slot filling aims to complete the missing infor-\nmation for certain relations of entities (Surdeanu\nand Ji, 2014) (e.g., subject entity Star Trek and\nrelation creator). It requires entity disambigua-\ntion and the relational knowledge for entities. We\nmodel the structured string “subject entity [SEP]\nrelation” as input and the object entity as output.\n• Dialogue focuses on building an engaging chat-\nbot that can discusses a wide range of open-ended\ntopics such as whether (Huang et al., 2020). It\nrequires models to know about the background\nknowledge for the conversational topics. We con-\nsider the dialogue history as input and the next\nutterance as output.\n• Open-domain question answering is the task\nof producing answers to factoid questions in nat-\nural language (Zhu et al., 2021). The questions\ncould be about nearly anything relying on world\nknowledge. We consider the question as input\nand the answer as output.\n• Commonsense question answering aims to test\nif models can answer questions regarding com-\nmonsense knowledge that everyone knows (Dou\nand Peng, 2022). Similarly, we consider the ques-\ntion as input and the answer as output.\n740\n• Commonsense reasoning is intended to utilize\ncommonsense knowledge to reason about certain\naspects of the given text (Sakaguchi et al., 2020).\nTherefore, we consider the given text as input\nand the prediction as output.\n• Natural language inference is the task of deter-\nmining whether the given “hypothesis” logically\nfollows from the “premise” (Storks et al., 2019).\nIt acquires deep knowledge about the relationship\nbetween hypothesis and premise. We consider\nthe premise as input and the hypothesis as output.\nFor each category, we choose several representa-\ntive tasks to construct our pretraining corpus. The\ndetailed information of these included tasks is listed\nin Table 6. To mitigate the huge disparity between\ndataset sizes, we follow (Raffel et al., 2020) to use\nthe temperature-scaled mixing strategy with a rate\nof T = 2 for setting the proportion of data coming\nfrom each task. During pretraining, for each task\nexample, we use BM25 to retrieve top-10 passages\nfrom CCNet as our external knowledge. The input\ntexts are concatenated with the retrieved passages\nusing manually-written prompts. The final input is\nconstructed in the following format:\nContext: [passage1]...[passage10]\n[Task Instruction]: [the original input text]\nOption 1: [option1]...Option n: [optionn]\nThe “Option” string is applied only when the input\ntext is provided with several candidate answers.\nThe blanks “[passagen]” and “[optionn]” is filled\nwith the retrieved passages and candidate answers.\nThe blank “[Task Instruction]” aims to indicate\nthe task for our model, which is task-specific and\ndetailed in Table 7.\nB Implementation Details\nOur UniWeb model uses a Transformer with\n12 layers in both encoder and decoder ( 406M\nparameters), the same as the model size of\nBARTLARGE (Lewis et al., 2020a). The hidden\nsize is 1,024 and the inner hidden size of the feed-\nforward network is 4,096. We employ the byte-\npair-encoding (BPE) tokenizer, and the vocabulary\nsize is 50,267. We initialize the backbone with the\nMVP model (Tang et al., 2022), a supervised pre-\ntrained PLM, to provide a good starting point for\ngeneration following previous work (Dong et al.,\n2019; Zhang et al., 2020). We pretrain the model\nwith batch size 8,192 on Tesla A100 40GB GPUs.\nAlgorithm 1 The pseudo code for UNIWEB.\nRequire: A search engine ( i.e., Google Search)\nconnecting with the large-scale web\n1: Input: Training data D\n2: Output: Model parameters Θ\n3: Initialize Θ\n4: while not convergence do\n5: for iteration = 1 to |D|do\n6: Acquire an input-output pair ⟨X,Y⟩\n▷Self-Evaluation\n7: Compute the entropyH( ˜Y|X) of the sam-\npled output distribution (Eq. 2)\n▷Search Engine Assisted Learning\n8: if H >ηthen\n9: Use Xas a query to the search engine\n10: Return top-Kpassages P\n11: else\nThe passages Pare null ∅\n12: end if\n▷ Knowledge-Intensive Tasks\n13: Generate the output text ˜Yand compute\nthe loss L1 based on Xand P(Eq. 3)\n▷ Continual Knowledge Learning\n14: Mask salient spans of Pfor the CKL pre-\ntraining and compute the loss L2 (Eq. 4)\n▷ Model Optimization\n15: Compute the gradients and update model\nparameters Θ based on L1 and L2\n16: end for\n17: end while\n18: return Θ\nFor our model, the maximum length of both in-\nput and output sequences is set to1,024 for support-\ning examples to contain more tokens. We optimize\nthe model with a constant learning rate of2 ×10−5\nusing standard sequence-to-sequence cross-entropy\nloss. We apply the AdamW optimizer (Loshchilov\nand Hutter, 2019) with β1 = 0 .9, β2 = 0 .98,\nϵ = 1 ×10−6 to improve training stability (Liu\net al., 2019a). The weight decay coefficient is\n0.1. For testing, we select the checkpoint with\nthe highest validation performance. According to\nthe results shown in Figure 2(a), we set the en-\ntropy threshold η as 4.0. The overall pipeline of\nour model is listed in Algorithm 1.\nSince the tasks of fact checking, slot filling, dia-\nlogue, and open-domain QA are specially designed\nbased on the knowledge from Wikipedia, we re-\nquire the search engine to retrieve the top-1 passage\nfrom the website https://en.wikipedia.org.\n741\nTask Families Tasks #Train #Validation #Test\nFact Checking FEVER (Thorne et al., 2018) 134,287 14,342 10,100\nSlot Filling\nT-REx (ElSahar et al., 2018) 2,999,272 26,833 5,000\nzsRE (Levy et al., 2017) 154,826 3,771 4,966\nDialogue WoW (Dinan et al., 2019) 63,734 3,054 2,944\nOpen-domain QA\nNQ (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) 108,890 6,008 1,444\nTriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017) 1,835,943 168,358 6,586\nHotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018) 88,869 5,600 5,569\nELI5 (Shuster et al., 2020) 804,370 18,037 600\nCommonsense QA\nCSQA (Talmor et al., 2019) 9,741 1,221 1,140\nSocialIQa (Sap et al., 2019) 33,410 1,954 2,059\nCosmosQA (Huang et al., 2019) 25,262 2,985 6,963\nPIQA (Bisk et al., 2020) 16,113 1,838 3,084\nCommonsense Reasoning\nNumerSense (Lin et al., 2020) 10,444 200 3,146\nWinoGrande (Sakaguchi et al., 2020) 40,398 1,267 1,767\nNatural Language Inference\nHellaSwag (Zellers et al., 2019) 39,905 10,042 10,003\nαNLI (Bhagavatula et al., 2020) 169,654 1,532 3,059\nTable 6: The statistics of our 16 knowledge-intensive tasks.\nTasks Task Instructions\nFact Checking Verify the following claim\nSlot Filling Predict the missing fact\nOpen-domain\nQA Answer the following question\nCommonsense\nQA Answer the following question\nDialogue Response to the following dialogue\nNatural Language\nInference Inference on the following context\nCommonsense\nReasoning Reason about the following sentence\nTable 7: Task instructions for each task category.\nC Supplementary Experiments\nRealTime QA. Previous QA systems mostly as-\nsume that answers are static regardless of the time\nof query (Chen and Yih, 2020). In this section,\nwe use the REALTIME QA benchmark (Kasai\net al., 2022) to test models about real-time, instan-\ntaneous information. At each week, REALTIME\nQA will retrieve news articles and ~30 human-\nwritten, multiple-choice questions from news web-\nsites (CNN, THE WEEK, and USA Today), which\ncovers diverse topics such as politics, business,\nsports, and entertainment. We adopt the origi-\nModels\nREALTIME QA\nOriginal NOTA\nT5 40.0 33.3\nGPT-3 56.7 23.3\nRAG+DPR 10.0 16.7\nRAG+Google Search 63.3 50.0\nUniWeb +Google Search 66.7 56.7\nTable 8: Accuracy results for the questions at week\nfrom 2022/12/11 through 2022/12/17. We utilize DPR\nto retrieve top-5 documents from Wikipedia and use\nGoogle Search to retrieve top-5 news articles.\nnal and NOTA (none of the above) settings and\ntest our models over questions from 2022/12/11\nthrough 2022/12/17. The results are shown in Ta-\nble 8. Since one of the original choices is randomly\nreplaced with “none of the above”, the NOTA set-\nting results in a distinct performance degradation.\nBesides, due to the real-time nature of the ques-\ntions, only using DPR to retrieve texts from static\nWikipedia achieves worse results. Our UniWeb\nmodel with Google Search performs the best. This\nindicates that UniWeb can answer questions based\non the real-time information, rather than relying on\npast information from pretraining.\nSelf-Evaluation Criteria. To evaluate the model\nconfidence in task examples, we adopt the entropy\n742\nas criterion in Section 4.2.1. In this part, we test\nwith more kinds of criteria compared to the entropy\nfollowing Kadavath et al. (2022). First, we consider\na sample-enhanced prompting method, where we\ngenerate five samples with beam search and ask the\nmodel about the validity of the first sample with\nthe highest score. We show an example at below:\nQuestion: Who is the third\npresident of the United States?\nPossible Answer: James Monroe\nHere are some brainstormed ideas:\nThomas Jefferson\nJohn Adams\nThomas Jefferson\nGeorge Washington\nIs the possible answer:\n(A) True\n(B) False\nThe possible answer is:\nIf the model self-evaluate the possible answer is\nFalse, our model will leverage the search engine\nto access the web, otherwise not. We show the prob-\nability of predicting True depending on whether\nthe model gets the question correct in Figure 3(a).\nHowever, according to Kadavath et al. (2022), this\nself-evaluation method is mainly suitable for ques-\ntion answering tasks with short-form answers but\nbenefits less on question answering tasks with long-\nform answers. Second, we consider using loss as\nthe criterion to evaluate the model confidence. This\napproach is to generate a sample, and then look at\nthe model’s loss on this sample, averaged over all\ntokens, like the knowledge-intensive learning loss\n(Eq. 3). If the loss for an example is higher than a\nthreshold (e.g., 0.5), we consider that the model is\nunconfident about this example and we will query\nthe web to retrieve knowledge. In Figure 3(b), we\nshow the loss of samples that the model gets correct\nor incorrect.\nD Case Study\nIn Table 9, we present three examples from Triv-\niaQA (Joshi et al., 2017), CommonsenseQA (Tal-\nmor et al., 2019), and NumerSense (Lin et al.,\n2020). The first TriviaQA dataset is specially de-\nsigned based on the knowledge from Wikipedia.\nTherefore, we can observe that Wikipedia con-\ntains the most relevant passage about the topic\n��� ��� ��� ��� ��� ���\n������������� ����\n�\n��\n��\n��\n���\n���\n���\n��������\n�����������������\n�������������������\n(a)\n� � � � � �\n����\n�\n��\n��\n��\n��\n���\n��������\n�����������������\n������������������� (b)\nFigure 3: (a) Probability of True for prompts in Hot-\npotQA; (b) Loss of samples in HotpotQA.\n“US nuclear reactor accident in 1979”. In addition,\nthe web can provide another source of knowledge\nabout this topic. Although CCNet covers this con-\ntent, it does not give a clear answer to this question\n(i.e., full name of the US nuclear reactor). The sec-\nond CommonsenseQA dataset involves questions\nrelated to commonsense knowledge going beyond\nWikipedia. Therefore, Wikipedia can only provide\na fuzzy description passage about “Guitar”. The\nweb and CCNet return diverse knowledge but the\npassage returned by search engine is more helpful.\nThe thrid NumerSense dataset requires models to\nreason about the number.
