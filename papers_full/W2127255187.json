Current\nknowledge on the neural substrates and functions of tool use\nis mainly derived from patients with apraxia (Goldenberg and\nHagmann, 1998). Apraxia is a disorder of motor control char-\nacterized by impairment in performing meaningful movement\nwithout any impaired basic motor function. Beginning with\na study by Hugo Liepmann, numerous studies have shown\nthat there are several types of apraxia such as ideomotor and\nideational/conceptual apraxia (Liepmann, 1900, 1908). Studies of\napraxia patients have also shown diverse functional impairment\nin manipulating a tool (Heilman, 2003; Jeong, 2009). T ool-use\nis not a single cognitive domain and several types of tool-use\nimpairments occur (Goldenberg and Spatt, 2009). In particu-\nlar, patients with a lesion in the parietal area have difﬁculties\nmanipulating tools and pantomiming tool-use execution rather\nthan loss of the conceptual aspects (semantic knowledge and\nbasic purpose) of a tool (Vingerhoets, 2008; Goldenberg, 2009),\nwhereas other patients lose the conceptual idea of tools (Johnson-\nFrey, 2004). Goldenberg and Spatt(2009) showed that impaired\nretrieval of functional knowledge is related to frontal lesions\nincluding inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). In contrast, parietal lesions\nincluding supramarginal gyrus (SMG) and superior parietal lob-\nule (SPL), affect actual use of a tool (Goldenberg and Spatt,\n2009). Functional imaging studies in a healthy population also\nsupport this ﬁnding (Martin et al., 1996). Brain regions that\nsupport actual skillful tool manipulation (how to use a tool) and\nregions that store conceptual aspects of a tool (what a tool is\nfor) are different. Previous studies have reported that the cere-\nbellum, IFG, premotor area (PM), SPL, and inferior parietal\nlobule (IPL), which is subdivided into the SMG and angular\ngyrus (AG), have speciﬁc tool-use functions (Obayashi et al.,\n2001; Järveläinen et al., 2004; Maravita and Iriki, 2004; Obayashi,\n2004; Johnson-Frey et al., 2005; Holmes et al., 2007). Parietal\nareas and PM support skillful tool-use, whereas the IFG stores\nsemantic knowledge for tool-use (Lewis, 2006). The cerebellum\ncontains an internal model for tool-use (Fogassi and Luppino,\n2005; Vingerhoets, 2008; Ramayya et al., 2010).\nAfter the ﬁrst demonstration of synchronized low-frequency\nﬂuctuations ( ∼0.08 Hz) in the resting brain with blood-\noxygenation level dependence (BOLD) functional magnetic reso-\nnance imaging (fMRI), the “resting state network” and “intrinsic\nfunctional connectivity” have received a lot of attention (Biswal\net al., 1995; Raichle et al., 2001; Deco et al., 2011; Raichle, 2011).\nPrevious resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging\n(rsfMRI) studies have shown that anatomically segregated but\nfunctionally related brain regions are integrated and are organiz-\ning networks (De Luca et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2008). Functional\nMRI is an indirect measure of neuronal population activity\nin the brain. This method has given results compatible with\nEEG or MEG studies. More speciﬁcally, it has been shown that\nresting state network via fMRI is highly related to EEG microstates\nFrontiers in Human Neuroscience www.frontiersin.org February 2013 | Volume 7 | Article 49| 1\nHUMAN NEUROSCIENCE\nSouth       Korea.\n6\nYo o e t a l . T ool-use changes parietal connectivity\n(Britz et al., 2010 ). Network organization in the brain has\nbeen demonstrated not only with fMRI, but also using struc-\nt u r a lM R I ,D T I ,E E G ,o rM E G(Stam, 2004; Hagmann et al.,\n2008; Van de Ville et al., 2010). Even though several neuroimag-\ning methods deal different temporal and spatial resolution, and\nmechanism, multiple studies using different methods have com-\nmonly reported that the brain network as a whole, has small-\nworldness and functionally related regions are highly synchro-\nnized (Stam, 2004). In addition, functional connection strength\nof this synchronization would reﬂect cognitive or motor per-\nformance (Hampson et al., 2006; Baldassarre et al., 2012), mat-\nuration (Fair et al., 2008; Dosenbach et al., 2010), and recent\nexperience (Tambini et al., 2010). Resting functional connectivity\nvia fMRI might be more appropriate to study long-term changes\nbecause fMRI brain network is relatively more stable compared\nto the networks from other modalities such as EEG microstates\nwhich shows rapid dynamics (Britz et al., 2010).\nIn addition to the use of resting functional connectivity for\nrepresenting current brain function, resting functional connec-\ntivity has also been shown to have the plasticity. Neuroimaging\nstudies have demonstrated that motor learning induces not only\nan alteration in brain structure or functional activation with\nthe task but also affects the intrinsic functional connectivity\nof the resting brain ( Büchel et al., 1999; Grigg and Grady,\n2010; Voss et al., 2010; Ma et al., 2011; Taubert et al., 2011)\nas well as structural connectivity (Scholz et al., 2009; Taubert\net al., 2010). In addition, with cumulated evidence, it is now\nbroadly believed that functional properties (activation or func-\ntional connectivity) and structural properties (cortical thickness\nor structural connectivity) can be an indirect representation\nof each other ( Ilg et al., 2008; Greicius et al., 2009; Honey\net al., 2009; Granert et al., 2011). Hence researchers have been\nextensively using resting state fMRI to investigate resting func-\ntional connectivity representing brain cognitive function and\nbrain structure.\nProﬁciency at manipulating a new tool is a type of motor\nlearning (Berti and Frassinetti, 2000; Ishibashi et al., 2002a,b;\nWolpert et al., 2011). Effect of motor learning on functional\nconnectivity has been extensively reported, however, no study\nhas investigated the effect of tool manipulating practice on\nfunctional connectivity in the resting brain. In this study, we\nchose chopsticks-handling with the non-dominant hand as the\ntool-use task and demonstrated what and how the functional\nconnectivity changes in the resting brain reﬂect tool-use perfor-\nmance improvement. Because participants were already adept at\nchopsticks-handling with their dominant hand, non-dominant\nhand practice would inﬂuence the actual motor skill without\naffecting the concept of chopsticks. As we mentioned, tool-use\ncan be divided into two sub-domains, conceptual aspect and\nactual motor skill. In this study, we focused on acquiring motor\nskill without inﬂuencing the conceptual aspect. By doing this,\nwe could extend our knowledge on motor skill aspects of tool-\nuse, and could better understand the changes of the resting brain\nwhen acquiring new skill for tool manipulation. Thus, we hypoth-\nesized that practicing chopsticks-handling with non-dominant\nhand would mainly alter the intrinsic functional connectivity of\nparietal areas.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nPARTICIPANTS\nEight healthy young adults [two females; age of 16.5 (SD :± 0.53)\nyears, ranging from 16 to 17 years] volunteered for this study.\nEvery participant was right-handed according to the Edinburgh\nHandedness Questionnaire Inventory (Oldﬁeld, 1971). We set a\nscore of +40 as a criterion for right-handedness and scores of\nevery subject were over+40. Subjects are ordinary high school\nstudents extraneous to any kind of sports, musical skill, or any\nother hand skills. They also had no history of neurological or psy-\nchiatric disorders. The participants and their caregivers gave writ-\nten informed consent to participate in this study. This study was\napproved by the Institutional Review Board of Korea Advanced\nInstitute of Science and T echnology (KAIST).\nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE\nParticipants practiced handling chopsticks with their non-\ndominant hand (left hand) for 8 weeks using a chopsticks aid\n(Figure 1). Speciﬁcally, they practiced moving beans sized<1c m\nin diameter from one dish to another using the aid at least 30 min\neveryday; they also used real chopsticks with their non-dominant\nhand at every meal (three times per day) during the practice\nperiod. Initial performance of chopsticks-handling was measured\nbefore starting the practice runs, and the ﬁnal performance was\nmeasured after ﬁnishing practice of 8 weeks. Chopstick handling\nperformance was quantiﬁed by counting the number of beans\nmoved from one dish to another in 1 minute.\nThe participants underwent MRI scanning before and after\npractice, at weeks 0 and 8, respectively. We acquired structural T1\nand fMRI data. The fMRI scanning included two sessions, ﬁrst in\na resting state and the latter in performing task. During the resting\nstate session, subjects were asked to stay calm without thinking\nabout anything for 330 s, whereas during the task session, sub-\njects were asked to perform the chopstick-handling action using\ntheir left hand for 30 s following a 30 s resting interval, repeated\nﬁve times for 300 s. Subjects were instructed to keep their eyes\nopen with watching a ﬁxed white cross on the center of black\nscreen during the resting session. For the chopsticks-handling\ntask, subjects were holding a MR-compatible chopsticks aid made\nof plastic (Figure 1) with their left hand. They performed simple\npicking and releasing action with this aid, repeatedly.\nFIGURE 1 | A chopsticks-aid used for practice and during MRI\nscanning. Figure shows a chopsticks-aid for left-handedness, consisting of\na plastic body part and two rubber rings to place the index and middle\nﬁnger. The two sticks are connected, unlike normal chopsticks.\nFrontiers in Human Neuroscience www.frontiersin.org February 2013 | Volume 7 | Article 49| 2\nYo o e t a l . T ool-use changes parietal connectivity\nMRI ACQUISITION AND PRE-PROCESSING\nStructural and functional MRI data were obtained using a 3T\nMRI scanner (ISOL T echnology, Seoul, Korea) at the KAIST\nfMRI Center. An anatomical T1-weighted MRI was acquired\nfor each subject [repetition time (TR) = 2800 ms, echo time\n(TE) = 14 ms, ﬂip angle= 60◦,ﬁ e l do fv i e w( F O V )= 220 ×\n220 mm2,m a t r i xs i z e= 256 × 256, slice thickness = 4 mm, 35\naxial slices]. Functional T2∗-weighted images were also acquired\nusing a gradient echo planar sequence sensitive BOLD signal\n(TR = 3000 ms, TE= 35 ms, ﬂip angle= 80◦,F O V= 220 ×\n220 mm2,m a t r i xs i z e= 64 × 64, slice thickness = 4 mm, 35\naxial slices). Functional MRI pre-processing (slice-timing correc-\ntion, realignment, co-registration, normalization, and smooth-\ning) was performed using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM)\n8.0 in MATLAB R2011a (7.12) (Natick, MA, USA). The ﬁrst two\nfMRI volumes were discarded for signal stabilization before pre-\nprocessing. A slice timing correction was performed for the fMRI\ntime series, and spatial realignment was applied to these images.\nThen, the corrected and realigned fMRI time series images were\nco-registered with T1 MRI. T1 data were used as a normaliza-\ntion source image to register the fMRI images into the Montreal\nNeurological Institute space (MNI-152 stereotactic template).\nTransformation matrices from individual T1 to the MNI-152 T1\nstereotactic template were calculated, and these matrices were\napplied to each co-registered fMRI image. Finally, normalized\nfMRI images were smoothed using an isotropic Gaussian kernel\nof 6 mm full-width at half maximum to increase the signal to\nnoise ratio.\nINDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS (ICA) AND SECOND LEVEL\nCOMPARISON: RESTING STATE fMRI\nGroup ICA was performed on week 0 and 8 rsfMRI data sepa-\nrately using the Group ICA of fMRI T oolbox (GIFT v1.3i). We\nextracted 20 group-independent components, only 1 of which\nwas selected as a component of interest (sensory motor network),\nbased on its spatial distribution in the brain, covering the primary\nsensory area (S1), primary motor area (M1), and the supplemen-\ntary motor area (SMA) (Beckmann et al., 2005; De Luca et al.,\n2006). Individual resting state sensory motor network (rsSMN)\ncomponents extracted from group ICA were ﬁrst converted into\nz-score maps. Then, we used these pairs of rsSMNz-score maps\nas an input for the two-sample pairedt-test (week 0 vs. week 8,\np < 0.001, size > 8 voxels). As a control of task-selectivity in\nresting state networks, we compared the default mode networks\n(DMN) of weeks 0 and 8 to determine whether motor prac-\ntice affected other networks. We selected one component which\ncenters on the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex, and\nadditionally covers medial prefrontal cortex and lateral parietal\nareas, as DMN (Raichle et al., 2001). Then, the same procedure\nwas applied to DMN for the second level comparison.\nTASK fMRI FOR SELECTING REGIONS OF INTEREST (ROIs)\nFor this, we analyzed task fMRI data of week 0 and week 8 alto-\ngether collectively. The task fMRI data were analyzed using FMRI\nExpert Analysis T ool (FEAT) version 5.98, which is a part of the\nFMRIB Software Library (FSL). We performed GLM analysis for\nevery individual data of week 0 and 8. Then we did group analysis\nto ﬁnd common activation areas by chopsticks-handling task both\nbefore and after practice; 8 subjects× 2 times, total 16 data set.\nZ statistic images were thresholded using clusters determined by\nZ values > 4.0 and a (corrected) cluster signiﬁcance threshold\nof P = 0.05 (Worsley, 2001). By doing this, we could make one\ngroup-averaged task activation map for chopsticks-handling. We\nselected tool-use-related brain regions based on our task activa-\ntion results and rsSMN, and then drew 5× 5× 5c u b i cr e g i o n so f\ninterest (ROIs) in these regions manually. Additionally, we com-\npared the patterns of task activation during chopsticks-handling\nbefore and after practice of 8 weeks with the same threshold\nas above.\nANALYSIS FOR THE INTRINSIC FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY WITHIN\nTOOL-USE-RELATED AREAS\nWe ﬁrst extracted the average time series from each ROI deter-\nmined previously. A pair (weeks 0 and 8) of time-series was\nobtained for each subject. A functional connectivity analysis was\nperformed for every pair of the time-series using Pearson’s corre-\nlation within each set individually. As a result, 16 (8 subjects×\n2 time points) matrices of correlation coefﬁcients were acquired.\nThen we transformed the correlation coefﬁcient “ r”i n t o“z”\nscores by applying Fisher’sr to z transformation. We performed\nap a i r e dt-test group comparison of the time-series correlation\nusing these “z” score matrices. P-values < 0.05 (uncorrected)\nwere considered signiﬁcant.\nRESULTS\nPERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT\nWe performed two-sample pairedt-test to test subjects’ perfor-\nmance improvement. Every participant showed improvements in\nchopsticks-handling performance with their non-dominant left\nhand following practice. This improvement was statistically sig-\nniﬁcant on the group level (p < 0.0001). Before practice, they\nmoved 4.9 (SD: ± 4.7) beans per minute, whereas they moved\n11.8 (SD: ± 5.8) beans per minute after practice, thus showing\nan increase of 7.1 (SD:± 2.2) beans per minute).\nDECREASED CONNECTIVITY WITHIN rsSMN\nGroup-averaged rsSMNs of weeks 0 and 8 are shown in\nFigures 2A and B, respectively. In both states, group-averaged\nrsSMNs commonly included the bilateral S1 and M1. These\nnetworks also extended anteriorly to the PM and the SMA and\nposteriorly to the SPL and SMG. However, the intra-connectivity\nof the rsSMN at week 8 decreased signiﬁcantly compared to\nthat at week 0 (p < 0.001, size> 8v o x e l s ,Figure 2C).

However, we did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant\nchanges in functional connectivity in the IFG.\nDISCUSSION\nWe investigated the effect of practicing skillful tool manipulation,\nexcluding acquisition of the conceptual or semantic knowledge,\non intrinsic functional connectivity. We demonstrated that 8\nweeks of tool-use practice induced signiﬁcant decreases in rsSMN\nconnectivity and other intrinsic functional connectivity among\nbrain regions, particularly in parietal areas. Our results support\nthe hypothesis that parietal areas play a role in skillful tool-use\nmanipulation and that this feature is reﬂected even in a resting\nstate.\nPrevious studies have showed that intrinsic functional connec-\ntivity decreases after long-term practice (Ma et al., 2010, 2011;\nVoss et al., 2010; Taubert et al., 2011). In these studies, the func-\ntional connectivity of the resting brain among task-related regions\nincreases in the early phase of motor learning then decreases in\nthe late phase. These results might suggest and provide evidence\nfor non-linear change of functional connectivity with long-term\npractice. In addition to functional connectivity, fMRI activation\nstudies also have reported similar patterns, increased in early\nphase and decreased activation in the late stage of practice (Xiong\net al., 2009). This is consistent with the ﬁnding of less activation\nin experts compared to beginners (Bezzola et al., 2012). Previous\nstudies described practice of about 4 weeks as long-term thus 8\nweeks practice in our study was assumed as long-term practice.\nWith these previous ﬁnding and knowledge, our results provide\nevidence for that reduced neural cost and enhanced efﬁciency in\nthe brain’s functional network in controlling a cognitive or motor\nfunction.\nOther studies have reported that resting functional con-\nnectivity properties has a signiﬁcant relationship with task-\ninduced BOLD activity (Mennes et al., 2010, 2011), and that\npractice induces a decrease in brain activation ( Sayala et al.,\n2006; Reithler et al., 2010 ). These studies showed that rest-\ning state functional connectivity is positively correlated with\ntask-induced brain activation and that long-term practice\ninduces improvement in behavioral performance and decrease\nFrontiers in Human Neuroscience www.frontiersin.org February 2013 | Volume 7 | Article 49| 6\nYo o e t a l . T ool-use changes parietal connectivity\nin functional activation. These results from literatures coin-\ncide indirectly with our results, improvement in chopsticks-\nhandling and decrease in related functional connectivity. In\nour study, however, we could not see the difference in task-\nactivation pattern between week 0 and 8. This is might be\nbecause the task subjects performed in the scanner was too\nsimple. Even though subjects were using chopsticks aid to\nmimic picking and releasing of chopsticks-handling motion,\nthe task in the scanner was more similar to simple ﬁnger-\ntapping. This task would hardly represent the actual skill of\nchopsticks-handling. Hence our task-activation result might not\nreﬂect chopsticks-handling skill well. Other studies have reported\nthat functional connectivity of the resting-state brain or ampli-\ntude of resting functional connectivity may explain variability\nin subject behaviors ( Cole et al., 2012; Zou et al., 2012 ). It\nhas been also reported that functional connectivity via fMRI\ncan predict maturity of individual brain ( Fair et al., 2008;\nDosenbach et al., 2010). One study reported a positive asso-\nciation between global efﬁciency of the functional brain net-\nwork and intellectual performance ( Van den Heuvel et al.,\n2009). Thus, with the result of improved performance, we sug-\ngest that this decreased intrinsic functional connectivity within\ntool-use-related areas might indicate a change in the network’s\nefﬁciency for a speciﬁc function, becoming more efﬁcient for\nmotor functioning as a subject becomes more proﬁcient at\ntool-use.\nWe identiﬁed functional connectivity changes in several brain\nregions, and found that the functional connectivity alterations\nwere centered in the parietal lobe. This result provides evidence\nfor plastic change in parietal areas as the key feature during tool-\nuse practice. The SMG, an anterior part of the IPL, is involved\nin various aspects of motor function. Actual tool-use execution\n(Higuchi et al., 2007), imagination, and pantomiming of tool\nexecution (Imazu et al., 2007), and, more speciﬁcally, chopsticks-\nhandling (Imazu et al., 2007; Tsuda et al., 2009) actually induce\nactivation of the SMG. As a result of chopsticks-handling practice,\nintrinsic functional connectivity in the bilateral SMG decreased\nsigniﬁcantly. The change in the right SMG occurred because\nparticipants used their left hand during tool manipulation prac-\ntice. In contrast, the change in the left SMG supports the motor\nfunction dominance of the left hemisphere. Left hemisphere\nmotor function dominance and tool-use is now well-understood.\nJohnson-Frey et al.(2005) showed a distributed left hemisphere\nnetwork for tool-use. This network contains the SMG and AG\nas well as the PM. Other studies have reported that the SMG\nis involved in motor execution, mental simulation (Grezes and\nDecety, 2001), and motor attention (SMG in the left hemi-\nsphere) (Rushworth et al., 2001). In addition to the SMG, we\nfound a signiﬁcant decrease in functional connectivity in the\nSPL with other brain areas. The SPL is also involved in tool-\nuse (Choi et al., 2001; Inoue et al., 2001). The SPL also plays\na role in maintaining internal representations (Wolpert et al.,\n1998), contralateral coding of imagined body parts ( Wolbers\net al., 2003), hand grasping (Simon et al., 2002), and observa-\ntion of actions for acquired motor skill (Calvo-Merino et al.,\n2005).\nT o determine whether the change in functional connectivity\nwas task-selective, we investigated functional connectivity within\nthe DMN and of the IFG. The IFG is thought to store concep-\ntual aspects of a tool (Johnson-Frey, 2004). However, we found\nno changes in connectivity involving the IFG. Participants in this\nstudy had already learned to use chopsticks; thus, they would\nnot gain any knowledge of the conceptual aspects with practice.\nHence, our results are consistent with previous knowledge about\nthe role of the IFG in tool-use and the storage of semantic knowl-\nedge, and with our initial hypothesis. In addition, we did not ﬁnd\nany changes in DMN connectivity following chopsticks-handling\npractice. The DMN is shown to be deactivated during a task and\nnot to be correlated with motor function (Raichle et al., 2001;\nDamoiseaux et al., 2006). Our result of maintained DMN with\npractice accords with these previous reports. This supports that\nresting state networks play a speciﬁc role in each cognitive func-\ntion or that resting state networks have task-selectivity (Harrison\net al., 2008).\nOur study has several limitations. First, the number of sub-\njects participating in this study was relatively small. Thus, we\ndid not ﬁnd a correlation between functional connectivity and\nimproved performance. It might be possible to identify this cor-\nrelation with additional subjects. Second, the participants were\nrelatively young. Thus, their brains may have been more ﬂexi-\nble than those of older adults. Several neuroimaging studies have\nshown age-dependent differences in brain connectivity and plas-\nticity (Damoiseaux et al., 2008; Fair et al., 2008; Power et al.,\n2010). However, no research has directly compared practice-\ninduced brain plasticity in the resting state connectivity in differ-\nent age groups. Third, we applied rather less stringent threshold\nfor the analysis of rsSMN than task fMRI analysis to show clear\nresult. This might increase the risk of type-I error. However, in\ncontrast with change in rsSMN, we could not ﬁnd any change\nin DMN with the same threshold. Thus, given these results,\nwe carefully suggested that there is a task-selectivity in resting\nstate networks.\nIn summary, we demonstrated a tool-use practice-induced\ndecrease in functional connectivity in the resting brain. These\nchanges showed network selectivity such that the sensory motor\nnetwork showed decreased connectivity, whereas connectivity of\nthe DMN remained constant. Our results indicate that pari-\netal regions play a role in skillful manipulation of a tool in the\ntool-related fronto-parietal network, and that decreased intrinsic\nfunctional connectivity represents enhanced neural efﬁciency for\nperforming a task.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis research was supported by WCU (World Class University)\nprogram through the National Research Foundation (NRF)\nof Korean funded by the Ministry of Education, Science\nand T echnology (R32-2008-000-10218-0) and supported by the\nOriginal T echnology Research Program for Brain Science through\nthe National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the\nMinistry of Education, Science and T echnology (2010-0018843).\nWe thank the members of Laboratory for Cognitive neuroscience\nand NeuroImaging for helpful comments.\nFrontiers in Human Neuroscience www.frontiersin.org February 2013 | Volume 7 | Article 49| 7\nYo o e t a l .
