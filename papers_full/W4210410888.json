INTRODUCTION \nSecurity intelligence is nowadays one of the primary concerns of any country. It is an orientation of \nsecurity techniques based on artificial intelligence that aims to collect and organize all data related to threats in \ncyberspace [1] to detect possible attacks in real-time and focus on identifying criminal characteristics [2]. This \nrequires deeply identifying and analyzing both patterns and trends of crime [3]. Such profiling allows relevant \nprotection and anticipating the various incidents by earlie r detection of major attacks. In today's world, \nindividuals, including cybercriminals, have become technically sophisticated and repeatedly expressing their \nemotions on the web, especially on popular social media websites [4]. The internet phenomenal growth has led \nmore users to express their opinions online whether in daily chat (status messages about what the user is doing), \nconversations (tweeting to a user or group of users within a community), information sharing (posting links to \nweb pages), or news reporting (updates on the current case). \nTransfer learning has become one of the most used image classification approaches for reusing \narchitectures and weights learned on huge datasets to enhance small and particular classification tasks [5]. A \nsimilar outcome may be achieved in natural language processing (NLP) by reusing and transferring a \nlanguage model [6]. The bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) algorithm, in \nparticular, has been demonstrated to perform well on a variet y of English text categorization tasks, such as \nsentiment analysis [7]. Sentiment analysis using NLP and deep learning (DL) methods has recently been a \n\n      ISSN: 2502-4752 \nIndonesian J Elec Eng & Comp Sci, Vol. 25, No. 2, February 2022: 1131-1139 \n1132 \nhot study subject. Emotions are one of the most important components of human existence that may aid in \nthe identification of trends and user necessities. \nDL is a subfield of machine learning that allows machines to automatically link processes together, \nby allowing several algorithms to be used progressively while passing from step to step, it can solve complex \nproblems in almost the same way the human brain does. BERT is a model for learning linguistic \nrepresentations that use the attention transformers method. A DL model designed to handle sequential data , \nto learn the word-to-word contextual relation in a text [8]. \nThe rest of this paper is structured as follows. In section 2, we discuss relevant related works. Our \nmethodology is presented in section 3. Experiments and results are described in section 4. Finally, section 5 \nconcludes the study and suggests some areas for future research. \n \n \n2. RELATED WORK  \nVentirozos et al.  [9] applied a lexicon -based approach to detect aggressive, antisocial, or \ninappropriate behavior, within the context of the discussion. The authors employ SA at the message level, but \nstudy the whole communication thread using a set of n -gram, which is used for classifying the whole thread \nas aggressive or neutral. The lexicon -based approach has the advantage to not require prior training (on a \ndataset) to mine the data but the final r esult can differ according to the context in which the lexicons were \ncreated. \nSiriaraya et al. [10] applied the machine learning (ML) approach to create a crime -solving tool that \ngives context for criminal events. The authors utilize data from Twitter by  providing contextual information \nabout crime incidents occurring in a specific area (San Francisco) using machine learning classification \nmodels ( logistic regression  and support vector machine ). The machine learning approach can adapt and \ncreate trained models for specific purposes and contexts, but it has low applicability on new data because it \nnecessitates the availability of labeled data. \nPereira-Kohatsu et al. [11] applied a deep learning approach to develop a Twitter -based intelligence \nsystem for detecting and analyzing hate speech called HaterNet. The authors utilized a multilayer perceptron \nneural network that accepts as input the tweet's word, emoji, and expression embeddings tokens enhanced by \nthe tf-idf and output the area under the curve (AUC). \nBERT is one of the best DL algorithms in SA, as shown in [12]. Yadav et al. [13] used the BERT \nalgorithm to identify cyberbullying on social media platforms, utilizing the BERT model as a classifier with a \nsingle linear neural network layer, trained and evaluated on two social media datasets, one small and one \nfairly big. \nWeir et al.  [14] proposed a system that combines both machine learning and lexicon -based \napproaches to detect terrorist web pages, gauge the strength of their content, and categorize data collected on \nterrorism and extremism networks. The authors developed an in -depth frequency study of the syntax using \nthe Posit textual analysis toolkit, which included multi -word units and their related parts of speech. After \nthat, utilizing knowledge extraction techniques, the findings are used in a knowledge extraction process \n(decision tree, random forest). \nThe above-mentioned related works can give a decent sentiment analysis prediction rate in security \nintelligence context. However, works that use a hybrid approach of both lexicon -based and deep learning \napproaches are rare, especially in this context. As a result, our research contributes to the above -mentioned \nworks as an essential experimental expansion using a hybrid approach that combines both lexicon -based and \ndeep learning approaches. \n \n \n3. METHOD \nSentiment analysis has been practiced on a variety of topics like movie reviews, service and product \nreviews, news, blogs, chatbot, and security intelligence [7]. During an extreme incident, most of the \nmessages shared on Twitter are commentary -related, such as expressing thought s, reporting them, and \nattempting to understand what happened and why. Sentiment analysis research has mainly focused either on \nidentifying whether a given textual entity is objective or subjective or on identifying the polarity of subjective \ntexts [15]. \nOur case studies are examples of severe occurrences brought on by individual choices that had a \nphysical impact on individuals, and therefore these events would have multiple social media \ncommunications. Sentiment analysis (or opinion mining) is employed on Twitter by the means of one of the \nfollowing techniques: \n− Lexicon-based (rule -based) approach: it is used to characterize the polarity (negative, positive, and \nneutral) of textual material (words or phrases that convey the sentiment of the entire text). This method \nIndonesian J Elec Eng & Comp Sci  ISSN: 2502-4752  \n \n Crime prediction using a hybrid sentiment analysis approach based on the … (Mohammed Boukabous) \n1133 \ncan be divided into i) corpus-based (using corpus data in either a statistical or semantic manner) and ii) \ndictionary-based (using dictionary data). \n− Machine learning approach: this technique allows machines to learn tasks without being particul arly \nprogrammed to perform them. By training ML algorithms with examples of labeled emotions in texts \n(dataset), machines automatically learn how to predict sentiment without human intervention. ML \nmodels can be trained in SA tasks to read beyond simple de finitions, and understand more complex \nthings like context, metaphor, sarcasm, and misapplied words. The most promising algorithms are DL \nones. \n− Hybrid approach: it is the combination of ML methods and lexicon-based approaches into one system to \nenhance the model's performance as well as sentiment scoring. This gives us a machine learning model \nthat has been trained on a labeled corpus. \nOur proposed method is to use the hybrid approach to build a BERT model on a tweet’s dataset, \nlabeled using the lexicon-based approach by following the next steps as shown in Figure 1. \ni) First Step: Data collection. In this stage, data for our analysis is crawled from Twitter using Twitter \napplication programming interface (API). We remind that the data from this social media pl atform is a \nvaluable record of the intersubjective understanding of an extreme event by individuals and groups due \nto the navigational ease, anonymity (the ability to post any material without disclosing names), and the \npublication system's flaws (users only need to have each a valid account).  \nii) Second Step: Enrichment . We used the Spark natural language toolkit  (NLTK) library to break the \nsentences into words and tagging them. After doing the parts of speech (POS) tagging which stands for \nPart of Speech tagging on the words of tweets, we also tagged the different words based on five \ndictionaries that we fed into our system (positive, negative, incremental, decremental, and inverse \nwords) each one with a different weight. \niii) Third Step: Data classification. Using the above dictionary (tags), the model calculates the sentiment \nscore of each sentence and gives the overall sentiment score. A positive score is taken as a normal tweet \nand a negative one is taken as a crime-related tweet. \niv) Fourth Step: Pre-processing. Before we start building our BERT model, the acquired data is cleaned to \nmake it ready for feeding it into the classifier. \nv) Fifth Step: Building the model . We load the pre -trained BERT Sequence Classifier and Token izer. \nThen, we used the Sequence Classifier and BERT's Tokenizer, to build our model and tokenizer. \nFinally, we used this model on the Twitter dataset that we already labeled to fine-tune the classifier. \nvi) Sixth Step: Evaluating the model . We assess our mode l using the test dataset by predicting sentiments \nafter it has been built and generated. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1. Proposed method \n \n \n3.1.  Labeling the data \nThe Twitter data collected for text analysis contain 70 ,000 tweets (27 ,000 crime tweets, 43 ,000 \nnormal texts). The corpus for Christchurch Mosque attacks contains 37,000 tweets, El Paso shooting contains \n15,000 and Hanau attacks contain 18 ,000. The streaming Twitter API was used to gather these tweets. We \nwere unable to acquire historical data using Twitter since it only permits us to collect data from the last seven \ndays, and so we begin to collect tweets data these last three years.

It is the deadliest massacre to have occurred in peacetime in New Zealand since that of \nBoyd in 1809 (66 to 70 dead). \n− El Paso shooting took place on August 3, 2019, in El Paso, Texas [17]. Twenty-three people are killed, \nat least twenty-three others are injured. The killer was arrested after surrendering to the police, says he \nwanted to kill as many Mexicans as possible. Racist hate crime is the hypothesis favored by a survey. \nThe Mexican government considers it an anti -Mexican attack, an d the UN speaks of a terrorist act \nagainst the Latin American community in the United States. \n− Hanau attacks took place on February 19, 2020, 43 -year-old Tobias Rathjen from Hanau, hereinafter \nreferred to as \"R.,” shot and killed nine Hanau citizens with a migration background in front of a shisha \nbar [18]. He then shot himself and his mother in his parents' apartment. \nAfter collecting the dataset, we tokenize it and perform part of speech tagging (POS) for each word \nusing the Spark NLTK library to break t he sentences into words and tag them. Then, we enrich it using five \ndictionaries that we fed into our system (positive, negative, incremental, decremental, and inverse words) \neach one with a different weight (+1, -1, *2, /2, *-1, respectively). The positive and negative dictionaries are \nbased on Liu and Hu opinion lexicon [19] that we have completed with other security intelligence lexicon \nfrom different public security sources like the FBI NIBRS data [20]. We have also included in our negative \nlexicon the Islamophobia (terrorism and extremism against Muslims) most used words, resulting from \nincidents and events that affect Muslim communities in general [21] as shown in Figure 2. Subsequently, we \nget labeled words which we used to calculate sentences s entiments in general, whether normal or criminal. \nAnd so on, we were able to label our dataset. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2. Word cloud of Islamophobia \n \n \n3.2.  Preprocessing \nAfter the Twitter data has been gathered and converted to text format, it must be cleaned and pr e-\nprocessed before being utilized in sentiment analysis. Twitter data is notorious for being highly loud, with a \nlot of banal chatter and linguistic inconsistencies [22]. To make the Twitter data as clean and easy as feasible \nfor our sentiment analysis algorithm, the following preparation procedures were done. \n− Removal of tweets features: Tweets are frequently clogged with data that isn't immediately relevant or \nuseful for sentiment analysis. The hashtag sign (#), URLs/ hyperlinks, numbers, references to o ther \nusers, retweet symbol (RT), and emoticons are all included in this data. While not necessarily lacking in \nintrinsic worth, sentiment analysis algorithms do not identify this data correctly, thus it must be \neliminated first. \n− Removal of repeated letters  and tweets: In tweets, words are frequently written in extended or \nexaggerated forms (for example, “no” and “nooo!!”). To accommodate for this, the correctly spelled \nvariant of each lengthy version of a word has been substituted. Additionally, while extracting tweets, the \nAPI occasionally provides identical tweets, which we removed to prevent giving a single tweet \nexcessive weight. \n− Removal of stop words: we filtered the stop words using Python NLTK stop words as they are \n\nIndonesian J Elec Eng & Comp Sci  ISSN: 2502-4752  \n \n Crime prediction using a hybrid sentiment analysis approach based on the … (Mohammed Boukabous) \n1135 \nconsidered neutral polarity and are not useful for polarity decisions. \n− Lowercasing: as sentiment analysis algorithms include case sensitivity, all capital characters must be \nconverted to lowercase. Words with the distinct case would otherwise be considered as independent \nwords and processed accordingly. \nFinally, we filter our tags to have only adjectives, adverbs, and nouns as they are the most relevant \nPOS in SA for any language [23]. \n \n3.3.  Building our model \nNow that we have cleaned and prepared our data, we divide it into data X (texts) and label Y \n(sentiments), and then into a random training subset (80%) and testing subset (20%). We built our SA model \nusing a hybrid approach with first the lexicon-based to generate labeled output. Then, the output was fed into \nour BERT model for  training. This model used the basic BERT model (BERT -base that consists of 12 \ntransformer layers) and built our sentiment classifier on top of it. \nFor training the BERT model, we need to do some additional preprocessing: \n− Add special tokens to separate sentences and do classification: \n [SEP]: ending of a sentence. \n [CLS]: start of each sentence. \n [PAD]: special token for padding. \n [UNK]: everything else (unknown token). \n− Pass the sequences with a constant length (padding), that we limit to 512 tokens. \n− Create an array of padded tokens (0 s) and real ones (1 s) called attention mask. \nWe trained our model on three epochs (BERT models are already pre -trained, and a delicate fine -\ntuning usually gives better results) with a batch size of six (the total number of traini ng samples in a batch) \nand a learning rate of 2e-5. To get the predicted probabilities from our trained model, we applied the softmax \nfunction to the outputs.  On the prediction step, we used a forward pass to compute logits and softmax to \ncalculate probabilities. \n \n \n4. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS \n4.1.  Technical resources \nThe following hardware specs were used in our studies on the MARWAN high -performance \ncomputing (HPC) infrastructure: \n− CPU: 2 Intel Xeon Gold 6148, \n− RAM: 192 GB, \n− GPU: 2x NVIDIA Tesla P100 (12 GB). \nWe utilized Keras (2.4.0) [24], an open-source python DL framework that operates on top of Google's open -\nsource data flow software, and TensorFlow-GPU [25] as the backend engine in our experiment. \n \n4.2.  Evaluation metrics \nTo evaluate our model, we use d the following metrics: accuracy, loss, precision, recall, F1-score, \nand the confusion matrix. \n− Accuracy: is the percentage of correct predictions among all predictions as shown in (1). \n− Loss: is the difference between the model's predicted value and the actual value. Cross -entropy is the \nmost widely used loss function in DL as shown in (2), where p(x) is the real distribution and q(x) is the \nestimated distribution, both specified over the discrete variable x [26]. \n \n𝐴𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑦 =  \n𝑇𝑃+𝑇𝑁\n𝑇𝑃+𝑇𝑁+𝐹𝑃+𝐹𝑁 (1) \n \n𝐻(𝑝, 𝑞) = − ∑ 𝑝(𝑥)log (𝑞(𝑥))∀𝑥   (2) \n \nWhere: \n True positive (𝑇𝑃): is the number of successfully classified positive class records. \n True negative (𝑇𝑁): is the number of successfully classified negative class records. \n False positive (𝐹𝑃): is the number of incorrectly classified negative class records. \n False negative (𝐹𝑁): is the number of incorrectly classified positive class records. \n− Precision: is the percentage of all positive results that were accurately identified as shown in (3). \n− Recall: is the proportion of accurately identified positive results among the total number of existing \npositive class as shown in (4). \n      ISSN: 2502-4752 \nIndonesian J Elec Eng & Comp Sci, Vol. 25, No. 2, February 2022: 1131-1139 \n1136 \n𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 =  \n𝑇𝑃\n𝑇𝑃+𝐹𝑃 (3) \n \n𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 =  \n𝑇𝑃\n𝑇𝑃+𝐹𝑁 (4) \n \n− F1-score: commonly known as the F -score, is the harmonic mean of precision and rec all [27], with a \nvalue 𝛽 that emphasize one or the other as shown in (5). F -score has a maximum value of 1 and a \nminimum value of 0, and is always between precision and recal, \n \nFβ = (1+β2)∙\nprecision∙recall\nprecision+recall (5) \n \nwhere 𝛽 = 1, we have the standard F-measure or balanced 𝐹1-score as shown in (6). \n \nF1-score = 2∙\nprecision∙recall\nprecision+recall (6) \n \n− Confusion matrix: is a table that visualizes  the model's performance by putting predicted class instances \nin the rows and real class instances in the columns. \n \n4.3.  Evaluating our model \nThis study consists of predicting crimes using data from social media (Twitter) with a hybrid \napproach (lexicon -based and BERT) and has provided very promising results. In the following figures \n(Figures 3 to 5) generated by Tensorboard, we present the training accuracy, validation accuracy, training \nloss, and validation loss and for each class, we present the Recall and Precision, along with the F1 score \nwhich was trained over three epochs. As shown in Figure 3, our model in these three epochs (7  hours 10 \nminutes of training) the accuracy reached 97 .24% and the loss attained 8 .41% in training, and for the \nvalidation, it reached 94 .91% in the accuracy and 16 .26% in the loss  as shown in Figure 4 . Regarding the \nRecall, Precision, and F1 -score, we obtained more precise results for each of our two classes (crime or not). \nWe see that for the crime -related class, we got a precision of 92%, a recall of 94%, and an F1 -score of 93%, \nand for the normal class (normal text chat), we obtained a precision of 96%, a recall of 95%, and an F1 -score \nof 95% as shown in Figure 5. \n \n \n  \n  \nFigure 3. Training and validation accuracy Figure 4. Training and validation loss \n \n \nTo verify the performance of our model, we compared the results obtained (accuracy and F1 -score) \nwith other papers' results that also used Twitter as the dataset and dealt with the security intelligence field as \nshown in Table 1. We can see that the hybrid approach using the NLP’s model BERT gives better results \nthan the lexicon -based and machine learning approaches in both accuracy and F1 -score metrics, as BERT \noutperform the other NLP’s model in context understanding part, especially in the “context heavy” one, for \nwhich it is so important for analytics purposes. \n \n0.82\n0.84\n0.86\n0.88\n0.9\n0.92\n0.94\n0.96\n0.98\n0 1 2 3 4\nAccuracy\nEpochs\nTraining Validation\n0\n0.05\n0.1\n0.15\n0.2\n0.25\n0.3\n0 1 2 3 4\nLoss\nEpochs\nTraining Validation\nIndonesian J Elec Eng & Comp Sci  ISSN: 2502-4752  \n \n Crime prediction using a hybrid sentiment analysis approach based on the … (Mohammed Boukabous) \n1137 \n \n \nFigure 5.

Although substantial progress has bee n achieved in these areas of study, present \ncomputational models and methods are still unable to handle these sorts of expressions. \nA metaphor is a figure of speech that provides a language technique for conveying thoughts and \nnotions that are not the same  as they appear on the surface, it directly refers to one thing by mentioning \nanother, and to efficiently identify its hidden sentiment, the model must be capable of reading between the \nlines. In a sarcastic message, people use optimistic phrases to expres s their bad feelings. Because of this, \nsarcasm may readily mislead SA models unless they are expressly constructed to account for it. It can be \ndifficult to determine its sentiment without a thorough awareness of the situation, the subject, and the \nsurrounding environment. Cryptography focus on protecting messages (ensuring confidentiality, authenticity, \nand integrity) by often using secret keys. It makes a message supposedly unintelligible to anyone other than \nthose who are entitled to it, and so it is no longer possible to understand its content without more knowledge. \n \n \n5. CONCLUSION \nThis paper presents a crime detection and classification method based on a lexicon -based approach \ncombined with the BERT deep learning algorithm. The classification accuracy of the method used in this \narticle on the Twitter dataset reached 94.91%, along with 16.26% loss, 94.94% precision, 94.91% recall, and \n94.92 F1 -score. It can be seen from the experimental results that the method used in this article can be \neffective for crime  detection. Furthermore, it can be observed that the hybrid method based on BERT \noutperforms existing works in crime detection.  As future works, we will detect crime using other media such \nas audio, images, and videos based on this model. \n \n\n      ISSN: 2502-4752 \nIndonesian J Elec Eng & Comp Sci, Vol. 25, No. 2, February 2022: 1131-1139 \n1138 \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThis research was supported through computational resources of HPC -MARWAN \n(www.marwan.ma/hpc) provided by the National Center for Scientific and Technical Research (CNRST), \nRabat, Morocco. \n \n \nREFERENCES \n[1] I.
