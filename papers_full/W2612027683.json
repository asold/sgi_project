Detecting the type of fault in protection place is based on performance of the\nlearned decision tree. The simulations of power system and differential relay are accomplished in\nPSCAD and MATLAB. The main characteristic of the relay is being intelligence such that at first\nstep the decision tree is learned by several samples including faulted and inrush currents and then\nthe relay detects the internal fault intelligently and quickly and the outputs of the relay order to the\nbreakers in two ends of the transformer to be opened.\nKeywords: Transformer; Differential Relay; Wavelet Transform; Correlation Coefficient; On-line\nperformance\n1. Introduction\nToday, many schemes have been considered by designers in order to increase the efficiency even\nslightly and also effective performance against the inrush and faulted currents due to high\nimportance of differential protection. Because even these slight changes can lead to improve in total\nsystem. Therefore, the enhancement of efficiency by %0.01 is significantly valuable. Some of\ntechniques have been proposed to improve the efficiency of differential relay are utilizing the means\nlike time-frequency devices to analysis the differential signals and neural networks to get the system\nsmart [1-5], [10, 11].\nThe major contribution of the power equipment is transformer which is used in energy transmission\nlines. The damages caused by internal fault in any time and with any amplitude are considered as an\nimportant problem and the faulted transformer must be removed to protect the ocomponents of\nsystem. On the other hand, the differential protection procedure has to be accurate. So the\ndifferential protection is the most important type of protecting. Some of the disturbances cause to\ninaccurate performance in differential protection such as inrush current, transformer saturation and\nincreasing the excitation current. Exact and fast fault detection and distinguishing between inrush\ncurrent and internal fault is the most important aspect of differential protection, such that an\nincorrect closing order due to inaccurate detection can lead to irreparable economic damages.\nRecently the wavelet transform is known as the basic method to extract the features of transient\nsignals due to its capability to analysis these signals. The wavelet based methods can successfully\nbe used to analysis various signals particularly the signals with transient nature and time variant\nsignals like power system disturbances [1]. Some of the transformer protection methods have used\nthe S-transform and neural networks [2]. The fuzzy logic is another used method [3]. An effective\nmethod to prevent the inaccurate performance of the differential relay against inrush current is the\nBulletin de la Société Royale des Sciences de Liège, Vol. 86, special edition, 2017, p. 726 - 738\n727\none mentioned in [4]. In this method, first the differential and robust current are calculated and the\nmain frequency of each current is compared with the others in order to detect the phase angle\ndifference (PAD) or the secondary currents of the related transformer. Another method is based on\nwavelet transform, neural networks or integrated wavelet transform based on support vector\nmachine [7], [20]. In the other technique, the mean absolute deviation (MAD) and the wavelet\ncoefficients on a specific frequency band of wavelet transform are used [8], [21]. A method which\nmakes difference based on the differential current slope between inrush current and internal fault is\npresented in [9]. This simulation is based on the angle of the differential current slope vector in A,\nB and C phases throughout the sampling window. The inrush current is detectable by using of\nstatistical computations since the vector behavior of this current is different in short circuit\nconditions. In some literatures the Clarke transform and discrete wavelet transform are used to\ndistinguish between internal fault and the other cases [10]. Bayesian classification (BC) is another\nmethod to differential protect the transformer which operates base on rules in parallel with neural\nnetwork [11]. Discrete Fourier transform with neural network are utilized to identify the inrush\ncurrent and internal fault [12]. In [13] and [14] the concept of power differential is mentioned. The\nwavelet transform integrated with ANFIS is the other way to identify the inrush current and internal\nfault [15, 16]. The proposed algorithm based on harmonic processing of the differential current to\nprotect the transformer in contribution with ANN is presented in [17]. Adaptive differential\nprotection [18] and also decision tree [19] are used to protect the transformer.\nIn this paper we use the decision tree method to off-line differential protect of the power\ntransformer which is a sub-methods of the neural network. The decision tree is learned by several\nfaulted and inrush current samples simulated by means of PSCAD and is tested by some stochastic\ncurrent components in MATLAB environment.\nThe paper is organized as follow: the pattern recognition, decision tree and learning algorithm are\npresented in Sections II, III and IV respectively. The studied system in the paper is provided in\nSection V. The proposed method is described in Section VI. The simulation results and a\ncomparison with the similar works are presented in Section VII and finally the conclusions are\nstated in Section VIII.\n2. Pattern recognition\nOne of the existing phenomena detection methods is identifying based on features, but the features\nwhich provide the distinguishing possibility between the phenomena and the others. The\nconfiguration of the features and their changing manner is a behavior pattern for the phenomena\nwhich can be considered in order to recognize it. This is known as Pattern Recognition.\nIf the purpose of the pattern recognition methods is identifying the phenomena with stochastic\nbehavior patterns and the ones whose behavior manner is changed randomly based on the\nconditions, then we cannot define an exact and certain pattern for behavior manner and decide\nbased on. So the methods must be used in choosing the pattern recognition method which considers\nall of the behavior patterns of the phenomena as much as possible. One of these methods is neural\nnetwork in which the behavior pattern of the phenomena is learned to be used as a criterion in\nrecognition. The accurate distinguishing between the faulted and inrush currents requires a suitable\nchoosing of pattern recognition method which finally leads to correct learning of the system.\nBulletin de la Société Royale des Sciences de Liège, Vol. 86, special edition, 2017, p. 726 - 738\n728\nIn this paper we extract the desired features of two current components by choosing the proper\npattern that these features are the first and second harmonic components and distortion and wavelet\ntransforms energy and then we explain the extraction procedure and how to use of each feature.\n3. Decision tree\nThe decision tree algorithm is one of methods which are used to recognize the phenomena with\nuncertain features. This algorithm has a structure like neural network, but it is simpler and faster. In\nthis structure it is usually learned a known behavior pattern to the decision tree through the learning\nalgorithm in order to phenomena recognize which gives it the capability for clustering the similar\nphenomena.\nOne of the most important characteristics of decision tree is its capability to give priority to the\nparameters to distinguish between the behavior of purpose phenomena and the others who have\nsimilar behavior pattern. This always leads to obtain an optimal tree by considering the making\ndecision time, learning time and the decision accuracy related to identify the intended pattern.\n4. Learning algotithm\nThe decision tree algorithm must be learned by a desired method in order to be capable of\nchoosing phenomena among the others. In this paper we use the following procedure to create the\ndecision tree:\na) Extracting the purpose phenomena by considering the changes of one or more features\n(Since the capability of the decision tree in finding or giving priority to the features. It is\nbetter to be more the number of the measured features of the phenomena).\nb) Extracting the behavior of the other phenomena which may interfere with the purpose\nphenomena (similar phenomena).\nc) The learning of the decision tree is as follows:\n1. Choosing the best feature to distinguish of the other similar phenomena based on their\nbehavior sensitivity to the features changes (using the clustering coefficient). The most\nimportant choice in learning the decision tree in that which features must be choose as\nthe basis for decision making. On the other words, the feature is proper for decision\nmaking (separating the clusters) that can cluster the input data. The clustering coefficient\ncan measure the desire performance of each feature in separating the input samples\nbased on purpose clusters.\nThe clustering coefficient is defined based on entropy concept. The entropy is an index that shows\nthe amount of impurity of data toward the desired feature or illustrates the possibility of clustering\nthe input data to the decision tree toward the desired feature. On the other words, if the impurity of\ndada is zero then there is only one class or cluster among data toward the desired feature and means\nthat the entropy index is zero that equals to be zero the physical changes of data toward the desired\nfeature.\nThe entropy of B set contains the input samples, is defined based on n different classes as follows:\n(1)∑\n=\n−=\nn\ni\nii ppBEntropy\n1\n2log)(\nwhere pi is the ratio of the number of members in a subset of B which placed in class i.\nBulletin de la Société Royale des Sciences de Liège, Vol. 86, special edition, 2017, p. 726 - 738\n729\nNow the clustering coefficient of data, CF(B,Aij), which could define the amount of proportionality\nof choosing feature A from the B as the distinction between behavior of purpose phenomena and the\nothers as follows:\n(2))()(),(\n1\n, V\nn\nV\nV\nji BEntropyB\nBBEntropyABCF ∑\n=\n−=\nWhile BV is a subset of B such that desired Aij has the bV value (i is the number of sub-tree and j is\nthe subcategory of tree in level i).\n2. Executing the strategy of paragraph 1 in a lower level- As it shown in Figure 1, the\nalgorithm in paragraph 1 is executed among the subsets of input data clustered based on\nvarious desired values of B.\n3. Expanding the tree in each path- This continues until all of data can be take in a cluster\nor class, on the other words the entropy of all data in subset bV be zero.\nChanging the decision tree to the logic rules- The learned decision trees are ambiguous even in\nsimplest form. This is because each node is the content of a specific value which is obtained by\nexperiments in higher nodes. In order to be more readable the decision tree we can explain the path\nto each cluster by if-then rules. The if part contains all the experiments in the path and then part only\ncontains the final cluster.\nThese rules are known as \"logic rules\" and these total rules can recognize the pattern of all the\nclusters in the decision tree framework.\n5. Typical system\nA typical single phase system is shown in Figure 1. In this study the PSCAD has been used to\nsimulate the typical system. The power system in Figure 2 contains a three phase 230 kV, 50 Hz\npower supply which feeds a resistive-inductive 100 MW, 500 kVAr load through a Y-Y 230/63,\n300 MVA transformer. We use the \"Three Phase Fault\" block to simulate the internal fault. In next\nstage we apply this fault on different phases in various time intervals.\nFig. 1: The typical single phase system\nThe typical power system is illustrated in Figure 2.\nBulletin de la Société Royale des Sciences de Liège, Vol. 86, special edition, 2017, p. 726 - 738\n730\nFig. 2: The simulated power system\nWe use the hysteresis curve in Figure 3 to simulate the inrush current which leads to saturate the\ntransformer at startup.\n-1 -0.5 0 0.5 1\n-2\n-1\n0\n1\n2\nI(pu)\nPhi(pu)\nSaturation Characteristic\nFig. 3: The saturation characteristic of transformer\n6.

Features extraction\nThe features extraction and clustering is the most important steps among all steps of a tree\nforming or neural network learning since the desired performance of an intelligent system is defined\nbased on type of the learned feature to the decision tree. On the other hand, the proper choosing and\nclustering of the features is equal to better performance of tree and the accuracy parameter of tree is\nclose to 100 if the tree is properly and completely learned as we expect.\nOne of the clear characteristics of inrush current is that it has high, transient and time variant\nharmonic components while the faulted current has steady and single harmonic components. Using\nof applicable means in frequency domain will be helpful in order to extract the features related to\nthe harmonic components of signals. The features used in this paper are: the energy of first\nharmonic, the energy of second harmonic, distortion and the energy of wavelet transform\nrespectively which in the following we will explain the extraction procedure of each feature.\na) The energy of first and second harmonics: These signals have harmonic components so the\nenergy of first and second harmonic components in different cases can affect the decision of\ntree. The flowcharts of Figs. 5 and 6 show the extraction procedure of these two features.\n[ ]∑\n+∞\n−∞=\n−=\nn\nnjj enxex ωω)(\nHzf\njex\n100\n)(\n=\nω\nHzf\njex\n150\n)(\n=\nω\nFig. 5: The flowchart of extracting the energy of the first and second harmonics\nb) Distortion: The equation (1) is used to calculate the amount of the signal distortion.\nBulletin de la Société Royale des Sciences de Liège, Vol. 86, special edition, 2017, p. 726 - 738\n732\n[ ]∑\n+∞\n−∞=\n−=\nn\nnjj enxex ωω)(\n22\n3\n2\n2 ... nH IIII +++=\nFI\nF\nH\nI\nI\nFig. 6: The flowchart of THD extraction\nc) The energy of wavelet transform: The Fast Fourier Transform (FST) is a tool which is\napplicable in specific time intervals and frequency and isn't suitable for inrush distortions\nanalysis, but the wavelet transform is obtained from transmitting and changing the scale of a\nprimary function named the mother wavelet function and it can create various intervals in\ndifferent frequencies and it is suitable for time variant, transient and non-periodic signals.\nThe wavelet is a waveform which has limited time interval and zero mean value.\nThe equation of discrete wavelet transform is as follows:\n(6)dta\nbt\na\ntsbac\nR\n)(1)(),( −Ψ=∫\nwhere s(t) is the signal that wavelet transform is extracted from it and Ψ(t)is the mother wavelet\nand also:\n(7)2),(,2,2 zkjkba jj ∈==\nwhere j presents the decomposition level of signal and k is time in discrete form.

As it can be seen in Figure 7, in the first step of signal S is recording two approximation\ncoefficient cA1 and detail coefficient cDi which these two vectors are created by convoluting the\nsignal S to the filters. This means that convoluting the signal by low-pass filter Lo_D and high-\npass filter Hi_D creates the approximation and detail coefficients, respectively.\nBulletin de la Société Royale des Sciences de Liège, Vol. 86, special edition, 2017, p. 726 - 738\n733\ncA1\ncD1\nFig. 7: Single level wavelet transform\n6.3. Determining the efficient feature in learning\nAfter extracting the four features of each signal we can determine the efficient feature which has\nthe significant contribution in making decision and finally accurate learning of the tree in order to\narrange the rules before applying these features to the tree. As it can be seen in Figure 8, the fourth\nfeature has the more essential contribution in both inrush and faulted currents, since it has two\nseparated forms for inrush and faulted currents, as is evident in Figure 8.\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\nSamples\nFeature of samples\nEn1\nEn2\nTHD\nE Dw t\nFig. 8: The illustration of extracted features for 60 samples (the first 30 samples are inrush current\nand the other 30 samples are faulted current)\n6.4. Decision tree learning\nThe next step after determining the desired feature is clustering of these features. By considering\nthe Figure 11, the clustering of mentioned features for the first 30 samples (inrush current) and the\nother 30 samples (faulted current) are shown by I and F respectively, as is presented in flowchart of\nFigure 9.\nBulletin de la Société Royale des Sciences de Liège, Vol. 86, special edition, 2017, p. 726 - 738\n734\nFig. 9: The flowchart of tree learning\nThe considered samples in this paper contain the 30 internal faulted current samples (Figure 10)\nwhich is applied on the different phases and also 30 inrush current samples (Figure 11). The\nsamples are extracted and simulated by PSCAD. In the following, the MATLAB is used to\nmeasure the signal in real environment in worst case by applying a 20 db noise on signals and\nextract the mentioned features and create the decision tree and finally test it.\nFig. 10: A sample of faulted current by applying the 20 db noise signal\nBulletin de la Société Royale des Sciences de Liège, Vol. 86, special edition, 2017, p. 726 - 738\n735\nFig. 11: A sample of inrush current by applying the 20 db noise signal\nSince the extracted features of the sample is different from the applied current, we can define an\nindependent code for each current to clustering which leads to distinguish between faulted and\ninrush currents. After preparing the samples and extracting the features, the learning of the tree by a\ndesired feature is started. The tree defines the clustering based on rules by receiving the features and\ndedicated code to each class based on optimization algorithms. These rules are eventual rules.\n6.5. Testing the tree in a system with stochastic and new samples\nThe learned tree testing step is one of the most important steps since it explains the accurate\nlearning and the performance of the tree. In this step, it must be chosen some currents stochastically\nand applied to the tree. If the tree could recognize these samples correctly, then we can conclude\nthat tree learned completely and it can be applied to the relay as the making decision part.\nOtherwise the type of features or clustering method must be changed to obtain the 100 percent\nperformance. As it mentioned in the previous steps, we must make sure about the effectiveness of\nthe features before applying them to the tree so we can conclude that the feature of wavelet\ntransform is been chosen properly.\nFig. 12. The flowchart of testing the tree\nBulletin de la Société Royale des Sciences de Liège, Vol. 86, special edition, 2017, p. 726 - 738\n736\n7. The results of simuulation\nIn this paper, the 5 faulted current and 5 inrush current samples are applied to the tree\nstochastically and testing the tree is accomplished in three ways. As it can be seen in Figure 13, the\ncolumns of the graph present that 10 new and stochastic samples are applied to the tree in different\ncases. In the first case (0) the learning level of the tree is measured by the primary samples and the\ntesting of the second case (1) and third case (2) is done by means of clustering method and\nunknown, new and stochastic samples, respectively. As it is clear in Figure 13, the 100 percent\naccuracy is obtained in three cases.\n0 1 2\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\nState of testing\nTesting decision tree\nAccurancy of learning(%)\nFig. 13: Testing the tree in 3 cases for 10 samples\nThe presented method for differential protecting of the power transformer has some advantages\ncompared to the current methods. Since the power quality events, this method has more flexibility\nthan phase angle difference method in [4]. Moreover, the proposed method is faster than neural\nnetwork and support vector machine methods in [5-7] due to using of the wavelet transform instead\nof discrete Fourier transform.\n8. Conclusion\nBy considering that the mentioned relay has a proper performance by applying on the typical\nsystem in MATLAB/Simulink, we can use that as an appropriate industrial relay. This relay is\nsuitable for Y-Y transformers since the used transforms. The designed relay in this paper has high\nspeed and very good performance to protect the power transformers which it is very important. One\nof the characteristics of the designed relay is being adjustable the performance threshold of it in\ndifferent industrial applications and distinguishing between the currents caused by saturating of the\ncore of transformer and internal and external faults. This sometimes interfere the performance of the\ndifferential relay and it send the trip order incorrectly in some cases. On the other hand, it may\noccur an internal fault during the saturation of the transformer which this disturbance has minimum\neffect on the performance of the relay by analyzing the correlation coefficient. The minimum time\nof the fault detection from the beginning until reacting the relay is a few microseconds and its\nmaximum time is less than 10 milliseconds which this feature provides high flexibility in various\npower systems contain of transformers and relay.\nBulletin de la Société Royale des Sciences de Liège, Vol. 86, special edition, 2017, p. 726 - 738\n737\nReferences\n[1] Rasoulpoor M, Banejad M.
