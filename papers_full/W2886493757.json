Thus, \nhaving knowledge of residual life of cutting tool is highly recommended so as to maximise the \navailability time and reduce the machining cost. The aim of this work is to find out residual life of \na worn cutting tool which has been used for turning of Ti-6Al-4V alloy under constant cutting \ncondition. The lognormal distribution is used to model the cutting tool life data. Remaining useful \nlife of cutting tool is estimated using Mean Remaining Life (MRL) function . The results obtained \nfrom model are compared with the experimental results and it shows good agreement.\n1 Introduction \nAim of modern manufacturing industry is to produce \neconomical and reliable product along with good quality. \nQuality of machining product is generally referred as \nsurface finish and accuracy in dimensions, which are \nhighly dependent on the condition of cutting tool. Besides \nproduct quality, tool failure puts high impact on \nmachining system and productivity. Moreover, in the total \ncost of machining, tooling cost accounts for a significant \npart (approximately 25%) [1]. Most of the time cutting \ntools are either overused or underused with respect to \noptimum tool life.  Study suggests that, cutting tools are \ntypically utilised only up to 70–80% of its optimum life \n[2]. Hence, the prediction of remaining useful life (RUL) \nof cutting tool is important when a significant amount of \ncost is involved in a machining process. \nTill now many researchers have developed \nvarious models for estimating cutting tool life. Devor, et \nal [3] concluded that the life span of cutting tool is a \nprobabilistic phenomenon. Based on this fact, till now \ndifferent reliability model has been proposed [4-5]. \nRodriguez, et al [6] suggested a strategy of optimum tool \nreplenishment based on analysis of cutting tool reliability. \nXiao-Sheng, et al [7] presented brief review on recent \ndevelopments of various models for estimating the RUL. \nBenkedjouh, et al [8] proposed a methodology for \nestimating the remaining useful life of cutting inserts \nwhich is based on the support vector regression. Gebraeel, \net al [9] used artificial neural network approach for \npredicting remaining life of bearing. Aramesh, et al [10 ] \nintroduced a model for predicting the remaining tool life \nin variable machining conditions using proportion hazard \nmodel. In this paper, the weibull distribution was used for \nmodelling baseline hazard function of PHM.  \nThe aim of this study is to present a probabilistic \napproach to assess useful remaining life of a worn cutting \ntool which has been used for turning of Ti-6Al-4V alloy \nunder constant cutting condition. The lognormal \ndistribution is used to fit the tool life data. Finally, Mean \nRemaining Life (MRL) equation is used to estimate \nexpected residual life of cutting tool. \n2 Tool Wear \nFailure of cutting tool mainly occurs due to gradual \nblunting of cutting edge. Tool wear which takes place on \nthe rake surface of the tool is called crater wear and which \noccurs on the flank surface called flank wear. Flank wear \nbeing the most predominant wear mechanism, maximum \nlength of flank wear ( 𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚) is generally used as failure\ncriteria for determining tool life. However, depending on \nthe desired application crater wear could also be used as \nfailure criteria [11].  \n2\nMATEC Web of Conferences 192, 01017 (2018) https://doi.org/10.1051/matecconf/201819201017\nICEAST 2018\n \n \nAs shown in Fig.  1, a typical tool  flank wear curve \ninvolves three different states. At the initial state, the rate \nof tool wear is  high which is known as rapid initial wear \nstate. Next, at the steady state, wear rate remains almost \nconstant followed by the accelerating wear state where \ntools wear out very rapidly.  \nFig. 1.

Linear variation of tool flank wear between two points \nTool wear threshold limit is chosen based upon \nthe economic aspect of machining. As, once the tool gets \nworn out significantly, it effects the surface finish and \ndimensional accuracy of machining product. In this study, \nmaximum tool flank wear,𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 = 0.15 mm, is taken as \nfailure criteria. Which means, machining time \ncorresponding to tool flank wear of 0.15 mm is considered \nas useful tool life.  \nIn this study, lognormal distribution is used to fit \ntime-to-failure data of eight inserts. From previous \nliterature, it can be stated  that lognormal distribution \ndescribes tool life accurately over other distributions [13]. \nThe probability density function  𝑓𝑓(𝑡𝑡), for lognormal \ndistribution is represented as follow: \n                         𝑓𝑓(𝑡𝑡) =\n1\n𝜎𝜎𝜎𝜎√2 𝜋𝜋 𝑒𝑒\n[− (ln 𝑡𝑡− 𝜇𝜇)2\n2 𝜎𝜎2 ]\n  (2) \nWhere, σ and  denote the standard deviations and mean \nrespectively and t represents tool life as continuous \nvariable. The corresponding cumulative distribution \nfunction F(t), for lognormal distribution  can be derived \nusing the following relationship: \n𝐹𝐹(𝑡𝑡)  =  ∫ 𝑓𝑓(𝑡𝑡)\n𝜎𝜎\n0 𝑑𝑑𝑡𝑡   \n         =   ∫\n1\n𝜎𝜎𝜎𝜎√2 𝜋𝜋  𝑒𝑒\n[− (ln 𝑡𝑡− 𝜇𝜇)2\n2𝜎𝜎2 ]𝜎𝜎\n0  𝑑𝑑𝑡𝑡   (3) \nConsequently, the reliability function 𝑅𝑅(𝑡𝑡), for lognormal \ndistribution can be obtained from following relation: \n𝑅𝑅 (𝑡𝑡) = 1 −  𝐹𝐹(𝑡𝑡)  \n         = 1 − ∫\n1\n𝜎𝜎 𝜎𝜎 √2𝜋𝜋  𝑒𝑒\n[− (ln 𝑡𝑡− 𝜇𝜇)2\n2𝜎𝜎2 ]𝜎𝜎\n0  𝑑𝑑𝑡𝑡  (4) \nAfter constr ucting probability density function and \nreliability function, next step is to estimate the useful \nresidual life of cutting tool using mean residual life \nfunction (MRL) [14 ]. Given that a tool has used for \nmachining up to a certain time  𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑜 , the expected residual \nlife of the tool from that observation point can be \ncalculated by the following equation: \n                       MRL (𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑜) =  \n∫ 𝜎𝜎 .  𝑓𝑓(𝜎𝜎)𝑑𝑑𝜎𝜎∝\n𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑜\n𝑅𝑅(𝜎𝜎𝑜𝑜) − 𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑜  (5) \n5 Results and discussion \nFirstly, turning operation is performed f or each tool and \ntool life data are collected as shown in Table 3. Maximum \nlikelihood estimation (MLE) method is used to calculate \nunknown parameters ( and σ) of Lognormal distribution \nusing experimental data set [15]. This MLE is performed \nusing the statistical software R. The estimated parameters \nof lognormal d istribution are shown in Table 4 and \ncorresponding probability density function is shown in  \nFig. 5. Worn-out cutting edge after machining \nFig. 6. Probability density function  \nAfter estimating distribution parameters and \nconstructing reliability model, the next step is to calculate \nexpected residual life. This calculation is done by the help \nof Matlab software. \nTable 4.

In order to \ncheck the accuracy of the estimated result, the residual life \nwas observed by fur ther machining with the tool s and \nnoted down as presented in Table 5. \nTable 5.

Turning of Ti-6Al-4V is performed on a \nCNC turning centre and experimental data are collected. \nStatistical model is constructed based on these tool life \ndata. Once the reliability model is developed, it can \nestimate expected useful life of a worn out cutting tool. \nExperimental results show that the estimated residual life \nis in good agreement with the experimental one. It can be \nconcluded that, this approach of predicting remaining tool \nlife is helpful for mass production of parts , made up of \nsame workpiece material and with same type of cutting \ntool. \nReferences \n1.
