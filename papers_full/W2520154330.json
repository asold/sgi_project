Emery 1\nReceived: 18 January 2016 / Accepted: 28 August 2016 / Published online: 17 September 2016\n/C211The Author(s) 2016. This article is published with open access at Springerlink.com\nAbstract Physical cognition has generally been assessed\nin tool-using species that possess a relatively large brain\nsize, such as corvids and apes. Parrots, like corvids and\napes, also have large relative brain sizes, yet although\nparrots rarely use tools in the wild, growing evidence\nsuggests comparable performances on physical cognition\ntasks. It is, however, unclear whether success on such tasks\nis facilitated by previous experience and training proce-\ndures. We therefore investigated physical comprehension\nof object relationships in two non-tool-using species of\ncaptive neotropical parrots on a new means-end paradigm,\nthe Trap-Gaps task, using unfamiliar materials and modi-\nﬁed training procedures that precluded procedural cues.\nRed-shouldered macaws ( Diopsittaca nobilis ) and black-\nheaded caiques ( Pionites melanocephala ) were presented\nwith an initial task that required them to discriminate\nbetween pulling food trays through gaps while attending to\nthe respective width of the gaps and size of the trays.\nSubjects were then presented with a novel, but functionally\nequivalent, transfer task. Six of eight birds solved the initial\ntask through trial-and-error learning. Four of these six birds\nsolved the transfer task, with one caique demonstrating\nspontaneous comprehension. These ﬁndings suggest that\nnon-tool-using parrots may possess capacities for sophis-\nticated physical cognition by generalising previously\nlearned rules across novel problems.\nKeywords Physical cognition /C1Parrots /C1Means-end /C1\nCausal reasoning /C1Behavioural ﬂexibility /C1Tool-use /C1\nTrap-Gaps\nIntroduction\nThe comprehension of object relationships has typically\nbeen assessed using both vertical string-pulling and hor-\nizontal means-end problems. Vertical string-pulling tasks\ntypically require subjects to discriminate between strings\nthat are either connected, or disconnected, to an otherwise\nout-of-reach reward. Subjects then perform potentially\nnovel and coordinated motor actions to pull up the string\nto obtain the reward, and their performances may improve\nwith experience. While numerous species of birds have\nbeen tested on vertical string-pulling tasks (Jacobs and\nOsvath 2015), only budgerigars, Melopsittacus undulates\n(Ducker and Rensch 1977), parrots (Krasheninnikova\net al. 2013; Schuck-Paim et al. 2009; Werdenich and\nHuber 2006) and corvids (Heinrich 1995; Heinrich and\nBugnyar 2005) show an ability to rapidly, if not sponta-\nneously, solve more complicated conﬁgurations of this\ntask, such as correctly discriminating between rewarded,\nrather than unrewarded crossed strings and broken strings,\nas well as discriminating between pulling strings based on\nthe perceived effort required to retrieve a reward (Pfuhl\n2012).\nHorizontal means-end discrimination tasks, by contrast,\nare often used to assess physical cognition in primates,\ntypically by presenting subjects with a binary choice\nbetween a functional and a non-functional tool or a plat-\nform, with rewards placed at the distal ends of each option\n(Hauser et al. 1999; Povinelli 2000; Yamazaki et al. 2011).\nHowever, a variety of species, such as dogs (Mu ¨ ller et al.\n& Jayden O. van Horik\njayden.van.horik@gmail.com\n1 School of Biological and Chemical Sciences, Queen Mary\nUniversity of London, London E1 4NS, UK\n2 Centre for Research in Animal Behaviour, College of Life\nand Environmental Sciences, University of Exeter,\nExeter EX4 4QG, UK\n123\nAnim Cogn (2016) 19:1195–1203\nDOI 10.1007/s10071-016-1031-0\n2014) and elephants (Irie-Sugimoto et al. 2008), also show\ncapacities to solve this problem. While non-human great\napes essentially demonstrate spontaneous comprehension\nof horizontal means-end problems (Herrmann et al. 2008;\nMulcahy et al. 2013), yellow-crowned parakeets,\nCyanoramphus auriceps (Funk 2002), blue-fronted Ama-\nzons, Amazona aestival (De Mendonca-Furtado and Ottoni\n2008), and pigeons, Columba livia (Schmidt and Cook\n2006), are less adept. By contrast, ravens, Corvus corax ,\nand crows, C. corone, C. cornix , are capable of solving\nmore complicated crossed support tasks (Albiach-Serrano\net al. 2012; Bagotskaya et al. 2012), yet these corvids, in\ncontrast to great apes, Gorilla gorilla, Pan paniscus, P.\ntroglodytes, Pongo abelii , do not appear to comprehend the\ncausal principles of such problems (Albiach-Serrano et al.\n2012; Bagotskaya et al. 2012). The most convincing evi-\ndence that parrots are capable of comprehending the causal\nprinciples underlying means-end problems has been\ndemonstrated by keas, Nestor notabilis , in which one of six\nindividuals showed spontaneous success by pulling a\ncontinuous, rather than disrupted, wooden slat to retrieve\nan otherwise out-of-reach food reward (Auersperg et al.\n2009). Similar performances were also found in one of four\nblack-headed caiques, Pionites melanocephala , but not\namong four red-shouldered macaws Diopsittaca nobilis ,\npresented with continuous or disrupted strips of cloth that\nwere either connected or disconnected to a reward (van\nHorik and Emery unpublished observations).\nTrap-Table (Povinelli 2000), Two-Trap-Tube (Seed\net al. 2006) and Trap-Barrier (Martin-Ordas et al. 2012)\ntasks share similar functional properties. In these tasks, the\nsubject must avoid a trap or barrier to access a food reward.\nHowever, only a few individuals have been successful on\nthese problems. In species that naturally use tools in the\nwild, such as chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, individuals\nrarely succeed at the Trap-Table task (Povinelli 2000) but\nshow greater success on modiﬁed Trap-Table problems\nwhen they could choose where to insert a single tool on a\nbinary problem, rather than when choosing between two\npreviously inserted tools (Girndt et al. 2008) and when\nusing their ﬁngers, rather than tools, to move a reward on a\nsimilar Two-Trap-Box task (Seed et al. 2009). However,\nspecies that do not naturally use tools in the wild, such as\nhoolock gibbons, Hylobates hoolock (Cunningham et al.\n2006), and vervet monkeys, Chlorocebus pygerythrus\n(Santos et al. 2006), also show capacities to solve the Trap-\nTable task, although tamarins, Saguinus Oedipus (Santos\net al. 2006), and capuchin monkeys, Cebus apaella (Fujita\net al. 2003), failed. Similar ﬁndings have been found\namong tool-using and non-tool-using corvids on a Trap-\nTube task (Seed et al. 2006\n; Tebbich et al. 2007; Taylor\net al. 2009), whereas numerous species of parrots fail\nsimilar tasks (Liedtke et al. 2010).\nDue to their functional similarities, Trap tasks have also\nbeen used to assess the ability to transfer previously\nlearned information across novel problems. Great apes,\nhowever, failed to generalise information across the Trap-\nTable and Trap-Tube problems (Martin-Ordas et al. 2008),\nalthough in a similar task, apes previously exposed to trap\nor barrier platforms outperformed subjects that initially\nreceived a non-obstacle platform (Martin-Ordas et al.\n2012). Only New Caledonian crows, Corvus moneduloides ,\nthat previously solved a Two-Trap-Tube task could solve a\nTrap-Table transfer task, while those that failed to solve the\nTwo-Trap-Tube task also failed the Trap-Table task\n(Taylor et al. 2009). However, as presentation order of\nthese tasks were not counterbalanced across subjects, it\nremains difﬁcult to interpret whether successful birds\nsolved these problems by generalising causally relevant\nprinciples across the different tasks.\nAssessing different capacities to comprehend the\nunderlying causal relationships between objects may help\nreveal the selection pressures that drive the evolution of\ncognition (van Horik et al. 2012). The majority of physical\ncognition tasks are, however, based around tool-using\nparadigms, possibly because research on physical cognition\nhas typically focused on species that frequently use tools in\nthe wild, such as the great apes (Povinelli 2000; Tomasello\nand Call 1997). Yet species that do not naturally use tools\nalso show capacities for physical cognition when tested in\ncaptivity. For example, vervet monkeys which do not\nregularly use tools in the wild outperformed tool-using\nchimpanzees on a Trap-Table task (Povinelli 2000; Santos\net al. 2006). Moreover, corvids which do not use tools in\nthe wild, such as rooks (Bird and Emery 2009a, b; Seed\net al. 2006), show capacities for physical cognition that\nrival corvids that do frequently use tools in the wild, such\nas New Caledonian crows (Taylor et al. 2009; Weir et al.\n2002) and possibly great apes (Hanus et al. 2011; Mendes\net al. 2007). As such, habitual tool users do not currently\nappear to possess greater capacities for physical cognition\nthan non-tool-using species.\nSuccessful performances of both tool-using and non-\ntool-using species on some means-end tasks may, however,\nbe facilitated by simple perceptual cues experienced during\ntraining. As such, subjects may solve these tasks without\npossessing any causal understanding of the problem. In\nsome studies for example (Auersperg et al. 2009; Cun-\nningham et al. 2006; Irie-Sugimoto et al. 2008), subjects\nwere initially provided with training on a continuous sur-\nface (i.e. without a trap), or with continuous (i.e. unbroken)\nmaterials, before being presented with traps or non-func-\ntional materials that are disconnected to the reward. Hence,\nindividuals may solve the task through previously learnt\nassociations between the reward and the continuous surface\nor materials, rather than by understanding the causal\n1196 Anim Cogn (2016) 19:1195–1203\n123\nproperties of traps and connectivity (but see Povinelli\n2000). Paradigms that preclude the use of such perceptual\ncues, by using novel transfer tasks that manipulate causal\nrules associated with object relationships, may therefore\nbetter illuminate differences in physical cognition and\nfacilitate more accurate comparisons across species.\nDue to their large relative brain sizes (Iwaniuk et al.\n2005) and other socio-ecological traits shared with corvids\nand great apes, such as complex sociality (Hobson et al.\n2014), dexterity required for omnivorous extractive for-\naging, and protracted developmental period and lifespan,\nparrots may reveal similar capacities for physical cognition\n(van Horik and Emery 2011; van Horik et al. 2012). In the\ncurrent study, we investigate whether two species of non-\ntool-using parrots show capacities for physical cognition\nwhen tested on a means-end problem that lacks similar\nperceptual cues experienced during training. To do this, we\nintroduce a new means-end transfer paradigm that allevi-\nates the training biases which may promote learned per-\nceptual rules and limit interpretations drawn from previous\nstudies. We designed a Trap-Gaps problem to investigate\nwhether red-shouldered macaws and black-headed caiques\ncan generalise learned rules about object relationships\nacross novel problems. We assess whether subjects can\ndiscriminate between pulling food trays through gaps while\nattending to the respective width of the gaps and the size of\nthe trays. Subjects were presented with two tasks in a\ncounterbalanced order: one in which the size of the gaps\nvaried, but the size of the trays remained constant, and\nanother task where the size of the trays varied, but the size\nof the gaps remained constant. Hence, subjects could learn\nabout the relationships between objects through trial-and-\nerror associative learning in the ﬁrst task, but potentially\nsolve the second task spontaneously if they transferred\nthese causally relevant principles across the different\nproblems.\nMethods\nSubjects\nFour red-shouldered macaws: No. 2, No. 4, No. 5 and No.\n8, and four black-headed caiques: Green, Gold, Purple and\nRed (hereafter macaws and caiques), participated in this\nstudy. All subjects, with the exception of No. 4, were male.\nSubjects were hand-reared and each species were from at\nleast two different clutches. Individuals from each species\nwere 33 months old when tested and housed according to\nspecies in indoor aviaries (2 m\n3) under identical\nconditions.\nSubjects had prior experience with a number of tasks\nemploying object manipulation, including removing food\nhidden under different coloured lids (van Horik and Emery\nunpublished data). At nine months of age, subjects were\nalso presented with 100 trials on a means-end connected\ntask, where they were required to discriminate between\npulling vertical pieces of white cloth (25 mm\nwide 9 160 mm long) that were either continuous, and\nhence connected to a distal reward, or separated by a\n15-mm gap. One caique (Gold) made 9 correct choices on\nhis ﬁrst 10 trails (van Horik and Emery unpublished data).\nSubjects, however, had no prior experience with pulling\ntrays through gaps, or the any of the materials, colours,\nstrings or trays used in the current experiment. Both species\nwere raised under identical conditions and provided with\nequal experiences. Food and water were provided that\nad libitum and subjects’ participation was voluntary, i.e.\nthey were not forced to engage with the test apparatus but\ndid so of their own volition.\nMaterials\n(a) Training task\nSubjects were presented with two identical opaque green\ntrays (55 mm diameter 9 20 mm deep), each attached to a\n200-mm-long green string and positioned out of the sub-\njects’ reach at the distal end of a partitioned A4 letter tray\n(Fig. 1). The letter tray was ﬁxed to the outside of the\ntesting arena, and only one tray was baited with a clearly\nvisible food reward. While the trays were opaque, they\nwere wide and shallow. Hence, the rewards were not\nconcealed and the contents of each tray remained clearly\nvisible to subjects at all times. Either tray could be\nretrieved by pulling their respective string, but subjects\nwere required to discriminate between pulling strings that\nwere attached to a rewarded rather than an unrewarded\ntray. Subjects were not presented with gaps during training\ntrials.\n(b) Gaps task\nTwo identical opaque yellow trays (60 mm diame-\nter 9 20 mm deep), both baited with equal quantities of\nclearly visible food rewards, were positioned in the same\nlocation as above. A 200-mm-long green string was\nattached to each tray, allowing the trays to be pulled\ntowards the cage (Fig. 1). To retrieve the food reward,\nsubjects were required to discriminate between two dif-\nferent sized gaps. One gap (70 mm wide 9 50 mm high)\nwas large enough to allow the passage of the tray, whereas\nthe other gap (50 mm wide 9 50 mm high) restricted\naccess to the tray. Both gaps were positioned 170 mm from\nthe subject, with the trays placed approximately 30 mm\nbehind the gaps.\nAnim Cogn (2016) 19:1195–1203 1197\n123\n(c) Trays task\nTwo gaps of equal size (65 mm wide 9 50 mm high)\nwere positioned as above. Two baited blue trays, one large\n(75 mm diameter, 20 mm deep) and one small (55 mm\ndiameter 9 20 mm deep), were baited as above. Apart\nfrom their size, both trays were identical. The gaps allowed\npassage of the small tray but restricted access to the large\ntray.\nProcedure\nSubjects were tested individually in a familiar aviary that\nwas visually isolated from other individuals. Subjects were\ninitially presented with the training apparatus, requiring\nthem to discriminate between rewarded and non-rewarded\ntrays, and then subsequently tested on the Trays and Gaps\ntasks (Fig. 1). All trays were opaque, but their contents\nclearly visible to the subjects. Each apparatus was posi-\ntioned outside of the aviary, behind a clear Plexiglas bar-\nrier, with the strings initially out of the subject’s reach.\nAfter baiting the trays with a clearly visible food reward of\ncrushed orange Lafeber Nutri-Berries\nTM, the experimenter\nthen waited until the subject was within 10 cm of the\napparatus before administering a 5-s delay to allow the\nsubject time to view, but not access, the baited tray. Both\nstrings were then simultaneously presented, so that they\nprotruded under the Plexiglas barrier and were within the\nsubjects reach. Subjects were only allowed one attempt per\ntrial to pull a string and were considered to have made a\ncorrect choice if they retrieved the reward. The ﬁrst sting\nthat the subject picked up, with either their bill or foot, was\nscored as a choice. Subjects always retrieved the rewarded\ntray after pulling the correct string, whereas the incorrect\n(but still baited) tray always remained inaccessible. The\napparatus was removed after subjects pulled either a cor-\nrect or incorrect string and rebaited for subsequent trials.\nSubjects received a maximum of 10 trials per day. The\nlocation of the accessible reward was pseudo-randomised\nso that it did not occur on the same side for more than two\nconsecutive trials. Trials were recorded with a digital\ncamcorder (JVC Everio, Model No. GZ-MG645BEK,\nMalaysia), and the outcome of each trial was coded live via\nthe camcorder’s monitor. During trials, the experimenter’s\nhands were placed behind his back. A random selection of\n10 % of all trials ( N = 126) were independently recoded\nby a naı¨ ve observer (A. Hulatt) to determine inter-observer\nreliability ratings of videos, revealing 100 % agreement.\n(a) Training: discriminating between rewarded and\nunrewarded trays\nTo proceed to the test condition, subjects were required\nto choose the baited tray for 7 consecutive trials in one\nblock of 10 trials. After reaching criterion, subjects pro-\nceeded to the test condition on the following day. Subjects\nwere considered to have developed a side bias if they chose\nthe same side in six or more trials. To correct for side\nbiases, the non-preferred side was consistently baited until\nthe subject retrieved the reward over two consecutive trials.\nThe presentation order then resumed to its original pseudo-\nrandomised conﬁguration. Errors from side bias corrective\ntrials were included in the training analyses.\n(b) Learning and transfer\nAfter subjects mastered the training phase, they were\nprovided with the Gaps and Trays tasks in a counterbal-\nanced order. That is, after training to discriminate rewarded\nfrom non-rewarded trays, half of the test subjects pro-\nceeded with the Trays task, whereas the other half pro-\nceeded with the Gaps task. Individuals from each species\nFig. 1 Trap-Gaps Training and Test apparatus (not to scale). Food-reward trays (F) can be pulled towards the subject via a green string. Subjects\ncommence with the training phase then proceed with the Trays or Gaps tasks in a counterbalanced order\n1198 Anim Cogn (2016) 19:1195–1203\n123\nwere pseudo-randomly assigned to each task order. The\nﬁrst task that each subject experienced was considered an\n‘‘initial learning task’’, in which subjects could learn the\nrelationship between the trays and barriers. Subjects were\nthen required to reach a predetermined learning criterion of\neither 7 consecutive, or 9 out of 10, correct choices in one\nblock of 10 trials before participating in the subsequent\n‘‘transfer’’ task. Two learning criterions were used in an\nattempt to maintain subjects’ interest in interacting with\neach apparatus. Side biases were corrected, as above, using\nthe training apparatus. Corrective trials, using the training\napparatus, were not included in subsequent analyses.\nTesting ceased if a subject failed to reach criteria on their\ninitial task within 200 trials, or if subjects failed to reach\nthe transfer task criteria with 100 trials. To determine\nwhether subjects retained previously learned information,\nsubjects that reached criteria on each task were subse-\nquently re-tested with one additional block of 10 trials on\ntheir initial task.\nStatistical analysis\nWe used Mann–Whitney U tests to compare the number of\nerrors and trials that each group made before successfully\nreaching the training criterion. Exact tests were reported\nfollowing Mundry and Fischer ( 1998) to accommodate\nanalysis of our small sample size. Retrospectively, through\nprocesses of enumeration, we determined a probability of\nP = 0.02 that a given subject would meet the above\nlearning criteria within one 10-trial session. To do this, we\nsummed the number of possible successful combinations\nthat could be made in one 10-trial session (i.e. 20 combi-\nnations of reaching at least seven consecutive correct\nchoices in 10 trials, plus four combinations of nine correct\nchoices out of 10 trials) and divided this by the total\nnumber of possible choices (i.e. 24 successful combina-\ntions out of 1024 possible choices, i.e. each of the ten trials\nin a given session presents 2 options). As the learning\ncriterion was assessed repeatedly across sessions, we\nassigned each subject with a cumulative probability of\nsuccess to account for the increased likelihood of success\ndue to multiple testing. Each subject’s probability of suc-\ncess was therefore weighted by the number of sessions it\nrequired to either reach criterion, or by the total number of\nsessions a subject participated in before testing ceased ( cf\nGrant 1946). Cumulative probabilities were then used to\ndetermine Chi-squared values for each successful subject.\nThe summed Chi-squared values were then tested against\nthe summed degrees of freedom (all 1-tailed) using Fishers\nmethods (Sokal and Rohlf 1995; pp 734) and used to\ndetermine an overall probability that the successful per-\nformances of subjects differed signiﬁcantly from chance.\nResults\nTraining: discriminating between rewarded\nand unrewarded trays\nFive of eight subjects chose the correct side on their ﬁrst\ntrial of the training task. There were no signiﬁcant between\nspecies differences in the number of errors made (macaws\nmedian = 10, range = 4–23; caiques median = 5,\nrange = 0–17; Mann–Whitney U test, U = 5.0, N\n1 = 4,\nN2 = 4, P = 0.49), or number of trials (macaws med-\nian = 29, range = 18–77; caiques median = 23,\nrange = 7–49; Mann–Whitney U test, U = 7, N1 = 4,\nN2 = 4, P = 0.89), to reach the initial training criterion.\nTwo individuals from each species were therefore ran-\ndomly assigned to receive trials commencing with either\ntask. There were no signiﬁcant differences in errors (Trays\ntask median = 11, range = 5–16; Gaps task median = 5,\nrange = 0–13: Mann–Whitney U test, U = 2.5, N\n1 = 4,\nN2 = 4, P = 0.14), or trials (Trays task median = 38,\nrange = 18–77; Gaps task median = 19, range = 7–40;\nMann–Whitney U test, U = 3.5, N1 = 4, N 2 = 4,\nP = 0.20), to reach the training criterion between these\ntwo groups. However, due to limitations of a small sample\nsize these comparisons are likely to suffer from low power,\nand hence, any differences between these groups may be\ndifﬁcult to reveal. During training, two macaws, No. 2 and\nNo. 5, developed side biases in sessions 3 and 1, respec-\ntively, which were included in subsequent analyses of\ntraining performances.\nLearning and transfer\nFour of eight subjects (No. 4, No. 5, No. 8 and Purple)\nchose the correct side on their ﬁrst trial in the initial task,\nwhile ﬁve (No. 2, No. 4, No. 5, Gold and Red) of six\nsubjects were correct on their ﬁrst transfer task trial.\nAlthough the cumulative probability of success in Task 1\nfailed to reach statistical signiﬁcance ( v\n2 = 25.86,\nDF = 16, P = 0.06), suggesting that the initial learning\ncriteria were not rigorous enough, subjects’ performances\ndiffered signiﬁcantly from chance in Task 2 ( v2 = 26.67,\nDF = 12, P = 0.009) and in Task 1b ( v2 = 30.03,\nDF = 8, P = 0.0002) when they were retested on a further\n10 trials of their initial learning task. Subjects frequently\ndeveloped side biases throughout testing. Side biases were\nformed during the following sessions: No. 2: Task 1 Ses-\nsion 1, Task 2 Session 3; No. 4: Task 1 Sessions 2, 3, 4;\nGreen: Task 1 Sessions 1, 2, 6, 8, 9, 14; Red: Task 1\nSessions 2, 7; No. 5: Task 1 Sessions 1, 2, 4; No. 8: Task 1\nSessions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12, 14, 17, 21, 22; Gold: Task 1\nAnim Cogn (2016) 19:1195–1203 1199\n123\nSessions 1, 2, Task 2 Sessions 2, 4; and Purple: Task 1\nSessions 3, 9, 10, 12, 16.\n(a) Trays task\nAll four subjects that commenced with the Trays task\nreached the criterion to transfer to the second task (median\nerrors: 38.50, range = 20–64; median trials: 90.00, range\n45–134; Table 1). Only No. 4 and Red reached our criteria\nin the transfer condition. While No. 4 demonstrated similar\nperformances on both tasks, when re-tested on the initial\ntask this subject immediately reached criteria by choosing\nthe correct tray on all 10 trials.\nOnly one subject’s performance (Red) suggested\ncapacities to generalise previously learned relationships\nacross novel, but functionally equivalent, problems. Red\nspontaneously reached our learning criteria on the transfer\ntask, choosing the correct side for its ﬁrst nine out of 10\ntrials. Red again reached criteria when retested on the ﬁrst\ntask, successfully choosing the correct tray on all 10 trials.\n(b) Gaps task\nOnly No. 5 and Gold reached criteria on the Gaps task\n(median errors: 17.00, range = 10–24; median trials:\n49.50, range 32–67; Table 1). Two birds, No. 8 and\nPurple, failed to reach the initial task criteria within 200\ntrials and were therefore not presented with the transfer\ntask. Although Gold rapidly reached criteria on its ﬁrst\ntask, it made twice as many errors on the transfer task.\nWhile No. 5 reached criteria with fewer errors than the\ninitial task, both No. 5 and Gold failed to reach criteria\nwhen retested on a further 10 trials of the initial Gaps\ntask.\nDiscussion\nRed-shouldered macaws and black-headed caiques suc-\ncessfully learned to solve a means-end problem that\nrequired an ability to discriminate between pulling baited\ntrays through gaps, while attending to the respective width\nof the gaps or size of the trays. The performances of one\nsubject, when presented with a subsequent transfer task,\nmay also suggest that some parrots are capable of retaining\ncausally relevant information about object relations and\nthen using this experience to generalise information across\na novel, but functionally equivalent, problems.\nWhile all subjects learned to discriminate rewarded\nfrom unrewarded trays during the training phase, of the\neight subjects tested, three macaws and three caiques\nlearned to solve their initial presentation of the Trap-Gaps\ntask. Yet, subjects’ performances varied considerably,\nsuggesting that the ability to discriminate between the size\nrelationships of the trays and gaps required trial-and-error\nexperience and may be a particularly difﬁcult problem for\nthese parrots to comprehend. While all four subjects that\ncommenced with the Trays task learned to solve the\nproblem, only two subjects solved the initial presentation\nof the Gaps task. As such, the ability to discriminate\nbetween different sized gaps may be more challenging than\ndiscriminating between different sized trays. These ﬁnd-\nings may, however, be due to the experience that subjects\nreceived during training, which required attending to\nrewarded and unrewarded trays in the absence of gaps.\nHence, the different sized gaps may have been a less salient\nfeature of the task than the different sized trays. These\nﬁndings may also explain why many species struggle with\nTable 1 Number of errors and\ntrials to reach criterion for the\ntraining phase and groups\ncommencing with the Trays task\nand then transferring to the\nGaps task and vice versa\nTraining Learning Transfer Retest\nSubjects Food Discrimination Task 1: Trays Task 2: Gaps Task 1b: Trays\nErrors Trials Errors Trials Errors Trials Errors Trials\nNo. 2 23 77 20 47 ?33 ?100 N/A N/A\nNo. 4 6 18 20 45 21 68 0* 10\nGreen 17 49 64 134 ?51 ?100 N/A N/A\nRed 5 27 57 133 0* 9 0* 10\nTask 1: Gaps Task 2: Trays Task 1b: Gaps\nNo. 5 13 40 24 67 11 38 5 10\nNo. 8 4 18 ?90 ?200 N/A N/A N/A N/A\nGold 0 7 10 32 20 46 3 10\nPurple 5 19 ?93 ?200 N/A N/A N/A N/A\nTask 1b shows the number of errors that subjects made when retested on a further 10 trials of their initial\ntask.

Note that Red participated in\n10 trials in Task 2, only making its ﬁrst error on the 10th trial\n1200 Anim Cogn (2016) 19:1195–1203\n123\nthe Trap-Tube and Trap-Table tasks as they have to attend\nto a gap removed from the goal object. In contrast, to solve\nthe Trays task subjects have to attend to the goal object\nitself. The colour of the trays and the reward, crushed\norange Nutriberries, may have also been more conspicuous\nin the Trays task, where the trays were blue, rather than in\nthe Gaps task where yellow trays were used. However, the\ncontents of each tray were clearly visible and subjects\nrapidly succeeded in discriminating rewarded from unre-\nwarded green trays. While the trays differed in colour\nbetween the training and test conditions, the similar size of\nthe training task trays and the small (accessible) Trays task\ntray may have also facilitated subjects’ performances on\nthis task. Future studies may therefore beneﬁt by increasing\nthe size differences between the trays in each condition.\nTo test whether subjects solved the initial task through\nperceptual cues, or whether they showed a causal under-\nstanding of object relations, we presented the six birds that\nsuccessfully learnt to solve the initial task, three macaws\nand three caiques, with a novel, but functionally equiva-\nlent, transfer task. Four of six subjects reached criterion\nwithin 100 trials on the transfer task. One macaw made less\nthan half as many errors on the transfer task than the initial\ntask and one caique spontaneously reached criterion with-\nout making any errors. The remaining two birds took\nconsiderably longer to reach criteria on the transfer task\nthan compared to their initial performances. As subjects’\noverall performances on the initial task failed to differ\nsigniﬁcantly from chance, it remains possible that those\nsuccessful individuals, that reached our predetermined\nlearning criteria, did so without adequately learning the\naffordances of the problem. Subjects’ performances on the\ntransfer task may therefore have improved by introducing a\nmore stringent learning criterion during the initial tasks.\nWhile spontaneous success on the transfer task may sug-\ngest that at least one subject possessed a causal under-\nstanding of the relations between trays and gaps, it remains\npossible that subjects’ performances on the transfer task\nwere facilitated by simple perceptual cues learnt during\ntheir exposure to the ﬁrst task. For example, subjects might\nlearn that trays partially occluded by the barrier were\ninaccessible. While the apparatus was presented in full\nview, and subjects could clearly see behind the 50-mm-\nhigh barriers, this relatively simple associative rule, to\nchoose the fully visible tray, may therefore be sufﬁcient to\nsolve this task. Future studies may therefore consider\nmanipulating such perspectives to include conditions in\nwhich the larger tray, or the tray behind the small gap, is\nplaced at further distances to keep the visual cues available\nto the subjects comparable.\nThe fact that most subjects learnt to solve the initial\ntask, but failed to rapidly solve the transfer task suggests\nthat subjects may have learnt to attend to only one\ndimension of each problem, i.e. the size of the trays or the\nsize of the gaps, rather than the combined relation between\nthe trays and gaps. As such, rather than generalising rules\nacross tasks, subjects may have been confronted with an\nobject-relation reversal task, which may require additional\ntrials to unlearn the ﬁrst rule and then subsequently learn\nthe new rule. After learning each rule independently, (a) to\nchoose the small tray and (b) to choose the large gap, the\npoor performances of two subjects on the retest of Task 1\n(i.e. Task 1b) may therefore suggest that they were\nattempting to generalise a new rule to solve the initial\nproblem, rather than reverting to the initially learnt rule.\nUnlike the numerous species of parrots that failed to solve\nTrap-Tube problems (Liedtke et al. 2010), the macaws and\ncaiques in the current study, like rooks (Seed et al. 2006),\nmay have successfully solved their initial task by applying\na procedural rule based on an arbitrary cue, such as\nattending to the size of the trays in relation to the size of the\ngaps. The ability to recall learned procedural rules may,\nhowever, also be a particularly efﬁcient approach to solv-\ning repeatedly encountered problems. As such, two of the\nfour subjects re-tested on a further ten trials of their initial\ntask solved the problem without making any errors.\nRed-shouldered macaws and black-headed caiques nat-\nurally forage in the forest canopy (Juniper and Parr 2003),\nand an understanding of distal object relations, for example\nwhen pulling branchlets containing berries or seeds\ntowards themselves, may provide a selective advantage if it\nenhances an individual’s foraging efﬁciency. Evidence to\nsuggest that parrots possess capacities for complex physical\ncognition, comparable to other relatively large brained\nbirds and mammals, is growing (van Horik et al. 2012). As\nsuch, parrots have been observed to spontaneously make\nstick-tools in captivity (Auersperg et al. 2012) and may\ncomprehend physical concepts of objects such as func-\ntionality and connectivity (Auersperg et al. 2009) due to\ntheir motivation to manipulate and explore inanimate\nobjects (Auersperg et al. 2015). In contrast to the unsuc-\ncessful performances of parrots on some physical cognition\ntasks (Liedtke et al. 2010), ﬁndings from the current study\nbolster support for complex physical cognition among non-\ntool-using parrots. While the current study is constrained\nby a small sample size and possible procedural concerns,\nour ﬁndings suggest that the Trap-Gaps paradigm may be a\nparticularly useful approach for assessing physical cogni-\ntion among a broad variety of both tool-using and non-tool-\nusing species. Moreover, the Trap-Gaps paradigm reﬁnes\nprevious means-end and Trap-Table paradigms, as the\ntraining procedures do not confound interpretations of the\nexperimental trials by previously rewarding a continuous\nstring or platform.\nBy removing some of the perceptually learned cues that\nsubjects experience during training procedures in previous\nAnim Cogn (2016) 19:1195–1203 1201\n123\nmean-end tasks, the Trap-Gaps transfer paradigm, pre-\nsented in the current study, may provide an additional\nmethod to clarify whether tool-using and non-tool-using\nspecies with large relative brain sizes possess similar\ncapacities for physical cognition. Findings from the current\nstudy suggest that parrots, like corvids (Seed et al. 2006;\nTaylor et al. 2009) and great apes (Martin-Ordas et al.\n2008, 2012), may possess capacities to solve complicated\nmeans-end problems by generalising previously learned\nexperiences to help solve novel problems.\nAcknowledgments Funding was provided by the Royal Society and\nQueen Mary University of London.
