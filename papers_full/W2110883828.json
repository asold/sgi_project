    "abstract": "In this paper, a new simple design procedure of multi- frequency unequal split Wilkinson power dividers (WPDs) is presented. The procedure is based on using N-sections of transmission line transformers, instead of the conventional quarter-wave WPD branches, to realize a WPD that operates at N frequencies. Good isolation is achieved by using lumped resistors without any extra modiflcation to the conventional structure of WPDs. The analysis, design procedure, and mathematical expressions are presented for arbitrary design frequencies, and arbitrary power split ratio. For veriflcation purposes, a 1 : 2 dual-frequency, a 1 : 2 tri-frequency, and a 1 : 2 quad-frequency WPDs are designed and fabricated. The measured results show good agreement with those obtained using the presented design methodology and with full-wave simulated results.",
