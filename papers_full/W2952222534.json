Introduction\nThe beginning of the 21st century brought significant changes \nin transmission power grids. Performance requirements of electrical \npower equipment, including transformers, have also increased [5]. \nMore and more stringent standards and regulations force transformer \nmanufacturers to look for innovative solutions to fulfil them. At the \nsame time, it should be noted that energy consumption in areas char -\nacterized by high population density (which increases from year to \nyear) is constantly growing. Therefore, in addition to the use of dis-\ntribution networks that are harmless to the environment and people, \nsafe transformers are also required. As reported in numerous literature \nsources, even today large transformers, whose power exceeds several \nhundred MV A, should be integrated with large residential buildings. \nTherefore, issues such as fire safety and environmental protection are \nof particular importance [1, 35].\nFire safety is directly related to the exploitation of the transformer. \nIt is estimated that the risk of transformer fires is low but not neg-\nligible. However, in the event of a fire, the consequences are very \nserious. This applies first of all to transformers filled with insulating \nEk s p l o a t a c j a i NiEz a w o dNo s c – Ma iNtE NaNcE aNd REl i a b i l i t y Vo l. 21, No. 3, 2019 385\nsc iE NcE aNd tEc hNo l o g y\ncoefficient β were studied. Measurements of thermal properties of the \ntested vegetable oils for temperature 25, 40, 60, and 80°C were car -\nried out. On the basis of the measured thermal properties, according \nto the formula (1), the heat transfer factor α by the analyzed electro-\ninsulating liquids was calculated [12, 13]:\n αλ δβ ρυ=⋅ ⋅⋅ ⋅⋅ ⋅⋅ ⋅−− −+ cg cqnn nn n\np\nnn nn 13 11  (1)\nwhere: α – heat transfer factor [W·m−2·K−1], n, c – constants depend-\nent on the flow character, temperature and geometry, λ – thermal con-\nductivity coefficient [W·m−1·K−1], g – gravity [m·s −2], δ – character-\nistic dimension [m], β – thermal expansion [K -1], ρ – density [g·l -1], \ncp – specific heat [J·kg −1·K−1], υ – kinematic viscosity [mm 2·s−1],  \nq – surface thermal load [W·m−2].\nThe above formula shows that the increase in thermal conduc-\ntivity, density, specific heat, and thermal expansion coefficient will \nresult in an increase in the heat transfer factor α. In turn, the increase \nin kinematic viscosity will cause a decrease in the factor α.\n2.2. Methodology\nThe thermal conductivity of the tested vegetable oils was meas-\nured using a measuring system designed and built by the authors, de-\nscribed in the article [14]. In turn, the kinematic viscosity of the tested \nliquids was determined using Ubbelohde viscometers in accordance \nwith the standard [20]. The density of both esters was determined \nbased on the standard [21]. In turn, the thermal expansion coefficient \nwas measured in accordance with the standard [2].\nDue to the fact that the authors did not have the measurement sys-\ntem described in the standard [3], the specific heat of the tested veg-\netable oils was determined using the Mettler Toledo DSC1 differential \nscanning calorimeter (Figure 1). The measurement of specific heat \nconsisted in determining the heat flux transmitted during heating to \nthe sample of the test liquid, which was placed in an aluminium cruci-\nble, and the heat flux transmitted to the reference sample (empty cru-\ncible). Prior to the measurements, a temperature program defining the \ncourse of the measurement procedure was defined. It is important that \nin the temperature range in which the measurement is performed, the \ntest sample is thermally stable; i.e. there are no changes in it. This ac-\ntion causes that the sample temperature of the tested liquid changes in \nthe same way as the temperature of the reference sample – according \nto the adopted temperature program. In order to properly determine \nthe specific heat of the tested vegetable oils at the initial temperature \n(25°C) and final temperature (80°C) it was found that the measure -\nment of the stream of heat transmit to them should start at 5°C and end \nat 105°C. In the first stage of the temperature program implementa -\ntion, the tested vegetable oils were cooled to 5°C and maintained at \nthis temperature for 5 minutes. Then they were heated at a speed of \n5°C per minute to 105°C. In the last step of measurement of the sam-\nple was maintained at 105°C for 5 minutes.\nSpecific heat was measured under an inert gas atmosphere (ar -\ngon 50 ml·min\n−1) at a heating rate of 10°C·min −1. The mass of an oil \nsample was about 35 mg. All specific heat measurements were blank \ncurve corrected. The measurements of blank curves were performed \nbefore the sample measurements. Then, in accordance with the previ-\nously established procedure, measurements of samples of the tested \nliquid were performed.\nIn the last step, on the basis of the dependence of the thermal flux \ntransmitted to the liquid sample on the temperature, using the Mettler \nSTARe Evaluation program, the specific heat of the tested vegetable \noils was determined. The specific heat was determined based on the \ndependence:\nliquids, which are located in urban areas characterized by a large con-\ncentration of population, as well as located near water reservoirs and \nlandscape parks. Therefore, in addition to the appropriate electrical \nparameters to be met by the transformer, the environmental and fire \nproperties of the used insulating liquid should also be taken into ac-\ncount [9, 11].\nLimitation of soil and water contamination in the event of a trans-\nformer failure can be reduced by using environmentally friendly elec-\ntro-insulating liquids. Currently, most of the working transformers \nare filled with mineral oil. Recently, however, an increase in interest \nin liquids alternative to mineral oil, including natural esters, can be \nobserved [30, 38]. These liquids are already used not only in distribu-\ntion transformers but also in transmission transformers [23, 33]. It is \nworth noting that the first transformers designed at the end of the 19th \ncentury were filled with natural esters (vegetable oils). The increased \ninterest in vegetable oils, in the context of their application in electri-\ncal power equipment, results directly from their properties. In contrast \nto mineral oil, these liquids exhibit a number of features that in the \ncontext of environmental protection are considered their main advan-\ntages. These are primarily high biodegradability [8, 15], low toxicity \n[8, 41] and properties that directly translate into fire safety – high fire \npoint and flash point [11, 28, 29, 36].\nIn addition to the above-mentioned properties of insulating liq-\nuids, one of their key tasks, in addition to providing adequate electri -\ncal insulation, is the cooling of the transformer. Due to the fact that \nthe electro-insulating liquid constitutes the largest volume element of \nthe transformer cooling system, it mainly determines the effective -\nness of its cooling [25]. In the case of electro-insulating liquids, the \ncooling effect is related to the heat transfer effect of the liquid and is \ndetermined on the basis of the heat transfer factor α. In turn, this factor \ndepends to a large extent on the thermal properties of liquids, which \ninclude thermal conductivity λ, kinematic viscosity υ, specific heat \nc\np, density ρ, and thermal expansion coefficient β [13, 32]. Therefore, \nthe temperature in the transformer to a large extent will depend on the \nproperties of the used electro-insulating liquid.\nA high temperature is the main factor that contributes to the accel-\neration of aging processes in the transformer insulation system. Each \ntemperature which rises above the limit value, apart from the accel -\neration of aging processes, also entails a number of other negative \neffects such as increased gas emission [7, 22, 40] or deterioration of \nthermal and dielectric properties [10, 24, 31]. It can also contribute to \nthe danger both for the device itself, as well as for operating person-\nnel and the environment. In the past, failure of transformers has often \nbeen the cause of their fire and destruction. As a result, in addition to \nsignificant material losses associated with the loss of property and \npossibility of using energy, there was also contamination of soil and \nwater [6, 9, 26].\nThis paper presents the results of research on thermal properties of \nvegetable oils used as an electro-insulating medium in transformers. \nTwo popular natural esters, one of which is widely used in distribution \ntransformers, and the other with low viscosity, have been compared in \nterms of transformer cooling capacity. The results of the research and \ntheir discussion are presented in the following chapters. \n2. Purpose, range, methodology, and investigated ob -\njects\n2.1. Purpose and range of the work\nComparison of the heat transport capacity of popular vegetable \noils used as an electro-insulating medium in transformers was the \npurpose of this work.

The IR spectra were \nrecorded on a Nexus Nicolet model 5700 FTIR (Thermo Electron Sci-\nentific Instruments Corporation, USA) spectrometer in the 400–4000 \ncm\n–1 range (at room temperature) with a spectral resolution 4 cm –1. \nThe samples of oils were taken from hermetically sealed containers \nright after their opening and were scanned in the form of thin films \nbetween KBr plates.\nThe UV-VIS spectra were recorded on a Jasco V-530 apparatus in \nthe 200–1000 cm\n–1 range (at room temperature). For investigations, \nthe solutions of natural esters in heptane were prepared by dissolving \n2 mg of sample in 5.5 ml of solvent. Measurements were carried out \nin disposable cuvettes.\n2.3. Investigated objects\nTwo different commercial electro-insulating liquids were tested \nduring the experiment. Both tested esters have the same plant origin, \nhowever, they differ in basic parameters. The first of the analyzed \nnatural esters (natural ester NE 1) is widely used in distribution trans-\nformers. Its structure is based on a glycerol backbone, to which three \nnaturally occurring groups of fatty acids are attached. It was devel -\noped from vegetable oils and additives that increase its efficiency [8]. \nThe second of the tested natural esters (natural ester NE 2) is char -\nacterized by low viscosity. Like other vegetable oils, its structure is \nbased on triglycerides, but as a result of the chemical modification, \ntheir content is lower. In this ester, the ratio of triglycerides to mo-\nnoesters is about 50%/50% [39]. Data concerning the fundamental \nphysicochemical and dielectric properties of the tested electro-insu -\nlating liquids are presented in Table 1.\n3. Results\n3.1. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy FT-IR\nInvestigated vegetable oils are natural esters, i.e. triglycerides \n– fatty acid esters, containing a mixture of saturated and unsatu-\nrated fatty acids with different carbon length chains containing one \nto three double bonds. Therefore, their infrared absorption spectra \nshould differ. On Figure 2 IR spectra of investigated vegetable oils \nare presented. Comparison of these two spectra revealed that there \nare no substantial differences between them if we took under con-\nsideration the main absorption bands. We can observe slight differ -\nences in the intensity of some bands as well as some shifts in their \nposition. The main difference is observed in the so-called fingerprint \nregion, below 1500 cm\n–1; where each differ -\nent compound produces its own unique pattern \nof peaks. Spectral bands in the regions 3000-\n2800 cm\n–1 and 1500-1350 cm–1 correspond to \naliphatic hydrocarbons, while the bands in the \nregions 3040-3000 cm\n–1, 1680-1600 cm–1, and \n680-730 cm–1 correspond to olefin vibrations, \nwhereas peaks in the regions 1770-1715 cm–1, \n1300-1100 cm–1 are attributed to vibrations of \nesters. The exact positions of the individual \nbands in the spectra of investigated oils are \ngiven in Table 2.\n3.2. UV-visible spectroscopy\nThe UV-VIS spectra of investigated natu-\nral esters were performed in heptane because \nthis saturated hydrocarbon is essentially trans-\nparent in UV-VIS range. Therefore, absorption \nbands in the investigated range should be gen-\nFig. 1. Differential scanning calorimeter Mettler Toledo DSC 1\nTable 1.

The tested esters NE 1 and \nNE 2 contain chromophore groups in their structures, i.e. unsaturated \nbonds and carbonyl groups, the groups of atoms that contain elec -\ntrons which are responsible for the absorption in UV-VIS range. In \nunsaturated compounds, π → π * passes become possible, and alkenes \nabsorb ~ 170 nm. It should be noted here that the position of this \nband is significantly influenced by the presence of substituents. While \ncarbonyl compounds in addition to the π → π * transition can also \nundergo the transformation of n → π *, which absorb at a relatively \nlonger wavelength of 280-300 nm. Due to the structure of the tested \ncompounds, absorption bands in \nthe range of 200-400 nm were \nexpected. Figure 3 shows the \nUV-VIS spectra of investigated \nnatural esters (NE 1 and NE 2), \nwhere four main absorption \nbands are visible. The maxima \npositions of these bands are very \nsimilar for tested samples but \nslightly shifted (Table 3) and \nthey are in agreement with π → \nπ * and n → π * electron transi-\ntions due to the presence of C=C \nand C=O functional groups in \nunsaturated triglycerides, as was \nmentioned above.\n3.3.   Thermal properties\nTable 4 presents the results \nof the thermal properties of the \ninvestigated natural esters (NE  \nand NE 2). As it results from \nthe presented measurements, the \nthermal conductivity of the low \nviscosity natural ester (NE 2), \nregardless of temperature, is \nhigher than the thermal conduc-\ntivity of the natural ester (NE 1) \nby about 6%. Differences in the thermal conductivity of both esters \nresult from the lower molecular weight of the monoesters present in \nthe low viscosity natural ester. Lower molecular weight means that a \nmolecule is characterized by fewer degrees of freedom, and therefore \na greater thermal conductivity.\nOn the basis of Table 4, it can also be seen that as the tempera -\nture rises, the thermal conductivity of both esters decreases. This is \nrelated to the increase in the mobility of ions and free electrons. The \ntemperature rise causes the ions to vibrate more intensively, and the \nelectrons move faster in all directions. This action hinders the orderly \nmovement and consequently the transfer of energy, which results in \nreduced thermal conductivity.\nOn the basis of the presented research results, it can be stated that \ndepending on the temperature, the kinematic viscosity of the natural \nester NE 2 is lower than the viscosity of the natural ester NE 1 by \nabout 50-58%. Differences in viscosities of both esters result from \ntheir molecular weight and structure – the effect of intermolecular \ninteractions (the stronger the molecular interactions, the stronger are \nthe internal friction forces). Analyzing the structure of both liquids, \nit can be seen that the natural ester NE 1 is a mixture of triglycerides \n[8]. In turn, the natural ester NE 2 is a mixture of triglycerides and \nmonoesters [13]. The reduced viscosity of the natural ester NE 2 is \nmainly due to the addition of monoesters to triglycerides.\nSimilarly to the previous case, it can be seen that as the tempera -\nture increases, the kinematic viscosity of both esters decreases. This \nis due to the fact that as the temperature rises, the kinetic energy of \nmolecules increases. Particles with increased energy more easily \novercome the attraction forces of molecules with which they are adja-\ncent. In addition, at a higher temperature, the molecules move faster, \nwhich also results in a reduction of the attraction forces between the \nmolecules. As a consequence, as the temperature rises, the viscosity \nof the tested insulating liquids decreases.\nAs can be seen from the Table 4, the specific heat of the low vis-\ncosity natural ester (NE 2), regardless of analyzing temperature, is \nless than the specific heat of the natural ester (NE 1) by about 8%. \nThe differences in specific heat of both tested natural esters arise from \nTable 2.

As previously mentioned, \nthe low viscosity natural ester (NE 2) is a mix-\nture of triglycerides and monoesters. Monoesters \nare characterized by lower molecular weight, and \ntherefore their molecules will also be smaller. In \nturn, the smaller the molecule is, the less energy it \ncan store (it has a lower thermal capacity).\nAnalyzing Table 4, it can also be seen that the \nspecific heat of both esters increases with increas-\ning temperature. The increase in specific heat is \nrelated to the decrease in the density of the sub-\nstance (caused by the increase in the thermal ex-\npansion coefficient) and the increase in the kinetic \nenergy of the atom’s oscillation of the molecules of the both investi -\ngated natural esters. Therefore, the increase in temperature increases \nthe degrees of freedom available to the molecules, which results in an \nincrease in specific heat.\nAs results from the presented results, the density of the low vis-\ncosity natural ester (NE 2) is lower than the density of the natural ester \n(NE 1) by about 3.5%. Similarly, as in the case of viscosity, this is re-\nlated to intermolecular interaction forces. The intermolecular forces in \nthe natural ester (NE 1) are higher than in the case of the low viscosity \nnatural ester (NE 2). As a consequence, its molecules are not sepa-\nrated from each other as in the case of a low viscosity natural ester.\nAs the temperature rises, the density of the analyzed insulating \nliquids is noticeably reduced. Similarly, as in the case of specific heat, \nthis is related to the increase of kinetic energy. Molecules oscillate \nwith increasing frequency, which results in the weakening of inter -\nmolecular forces and increasing the distance of molecules from each \nother.\nAs can be seen from Table 4, the analyzed natural esters are char-\nacterized by a similar thermal expansion coefficient. Minimal differ -\nences, as in the case of density, results from the intermolecular forces \nof the examined natural esters.\nFurthermore, it can be seen that the thermal expansion coefficient \nof the tested natural esters increases with increasing temperature. \nSimilarly, as in the previous case, this is related to the weakening of \nthe intermolecular forces. Consequently, the molecules move away \nfrom each other, increasing the volume of liquid.\n3.4. Heat transfer factor\nTable 5 presents the results of calculations of the heat transfer \nfactor α of investigated vegetable oils depending on the temperature. \nHeat transfer factor α was deter -\nmined on the basis of Equation (1). \nAs is apparent from the calculations, \nlow viscosity natural ester (NE 2), \ndepending on the analyzed tempera-\nture, is characterized by a heat trans-\nfer factor of 15-19% higher than the \nheat transfer factor of natural ester \n(NE 1). The higher heat transfer \nfactor of low viscosity natural ester \nresults from its individual thermal \nproperties. As can be seen from Ta-\nble 4, this ester is characterized by \na higher thermal conductivity coef-\nficient, lower kinematic viscosity, \nas well as lower specific heat. Other \nproperties (density and thermal ex-\npansion coefficient) are similar. The \nviscosity of the liquid has a decisive \ninfluence on the value of the heat \ntransfer factor α, and this one is \nmuch lower in the case of the natural ester NE 2.\n4. Discussion\nThe electro-insulating liquid constitutes the largest volume ele -\nment of the transformer insulation system. Thus, it plays an important \nrole in the process of its cooling. Therefore, based on the measured \nthermal properties and the heat transfer factor calculated on their ba-\nsis, the temperature drop in the insulating liquid was determined – the \ntemperature drop ΔT between the windings and the tank. This tem -\nperature drop was calculated using the relationship:\n \n∆T q=α\n (3)\nIt has been assumed that the surface thermal load of windings \nis 2500 W·m⁻2, as this is a typical value for the surface of the trans-\nformer’s windings [45]. The results of calculations of the temperature \ndrop in the natural ester (NE 1) and in the low viscosity natural ester \n(NE 2) are shown in Table 6.\nAs it can be seen from Table 6, the temperature drop that occurs \nin the natural ester having reduced viscosity is lower. This decrease is \nfrom 2.6 to 4.8 °C and it is lower than in the case of the natural ester \nNE 1. This means that the use of low viscosity natural ester will have a \npositive effect on the transformer cooling system – the lower tempera-\nture drop in the liquid is, the hot spot temperature will be lower, what \nwill have a significant impact on transformer reliability.\nThe impact of temperature on transformer lifetime, calculated \nfrom Montsinger’s law, can be expressed by:\n \nte T=⋅ ⋅ −⋅7 154 1040 0865. .

The lifetime t is 20 years if transformer temperature T is 95°C. \nThe results of calculations are presented in Table 7.\nThere is evidence [27, 37] that paper insulation in transformers \nages more slowly in vegetable oil. It may be that an increase in oil \ntemperature may shorten significantly the expected service life of the \npaper insulation. According to Montsinger’s law, lowering the trans-\nformer’s working temperature by 8 °C may result in a two-fold in-\ncrease in the lifetime of its insulation system. Therefore, taking into \naccount the calculation presented in Table 6, it can be concluded that \nsuch a difference in temperature can affect the life of the transformer. \nHowever, it should be remembered that a certain drawback of Monts-\ninger’s law is the fact that it concerns paper insulation impregnated \nwith mineral oil, and also does not take into account other factors \naccelerating the aging process of transformer insulation, such as mois-\nture and the influence of oxygen.\nOn the basis of Table 7, it is possible to say, that lifetime of the \ntransformer, filled by a regular natural ester, can be from 4 to almost \n7 years shorter, than a lifetime of transformer filled by low viscosity \nnatural ester. This means that the service life can be reduced by about \n1/3, assuming that the transformer is designed for 20 years of work.\nBesides the positive impact on transformer lifetime, the reduced \ntemperature has also a positive impact on the work conditions of the \ntransformer, too. It means that lower temperature is able to decrease \nsome accidents, such as breakdown or partial damages. This fact \nshould be also treated as a positive influence on the reliable work of \ntransformers.\nOn the other hand, IEC 60076-7 [18] states that the lifetime of \nthe transformer insulation system is halved for every increase in its \nworking temperature by 6 °C. As it can be seen from the presented \ncalculations of temperature drops, the type of used liquid is important \nfrom the point of view of the lifetime of electrical power equipment. \nHowever, it should be noted, as McShane and others in [27] state, \nthat the paper insulation of the transformer, impregnated by a natural \nester, undergoes 5 to 8-fold slower decomposition than the paper im-\npregnated by mineral oil. Therefore, in vegetable oils, the increased \ndegradation resulting from the elevated temperature will in some way \nbe balanced by the rate of degradation in this oil.\nAs it results from the above calculations, the thermal properties \nof the liquid filling the transformer influence the cooling efficiency \nof the transformer. There are many publications that emphasize the \neffect of viscosity on the temperature field of transformers [4, 16, 42]. \nIt affects the efficiency of heat transfer in both natural and forced \ncirculation of liquids. Consequently, this translates to the operating \ntemperature of the transformer. In addition, it should be noted that it \nmay also affect the operation of some transformer internal compo-\nnents, such as internal on-load tap-changers [19].\n5. Conclusions\nThe heat transfer factor α of the low viscosity natural ester (NE 2) \nturned out to be higher than factor α of the commonly used natural \nester (NE 1). The reason for this, as could be expected, was primarily \nthe lower viscosity υ (by about 50-60%) of the natural ester NE 2, but \nalso the higher thermal conductivity coefficient λ. On the basis of the \nobtained results, it was calculated that the transformer filled with low \nviscosity natural ester will be 3-5 °C cooler. Taking into account the \nlaw of Montsinger’s, it can be concluded that this will translate into a \nlonger working life of the transformer and its more reliable work.\nThe temperature decrease by a few degrees is not without signifi-\ncance for the transformer. Too high temperature inside the transformer \ncontributes to the acceleration of the aging processes of its insulation \nsystem – insulation materials are subject to faster disintegration. If a \ntransformer becomes too hot internally, then the insulation materials \nwill degrade faster, and the operating lifetime of the transformer will \nbe shortened. Thermal modelling of the transformer allows, therefore, \nto ensure that the elements of its insulation system do not fail prema-\nturely. The right transformer design using thermal modelling allows \nensuring that the cellulosic insulation is adequately cooled, and that \nthe temperature increase at hot spots is not excessive, what has a posi-\ntive impact on transformer reliability.\nIt is well recognized, that mineral oil is the best cooling liquid, \nused in power transformer, comparing to any esters (natural, synthet-\nic, and low viscosity esters). On the other hand, mineral oil has not \nsatisfied environmental properties, such as flash point, fire point, and \nbiodegradability. Future investigations should be focused on inves-\ntigations of mineral oil and low viscosity natural ester mixture. The \nTable 6.
