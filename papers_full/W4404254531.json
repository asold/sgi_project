    "abstract": "Alerts are an essential tool for the detection of anomalies and ensuring the smooth operation of online service systems by promptly notifying engineers of potential issues. However, the increasing scale and complexity of IT infrastructure often result in “alert storms” during system failures, overwhelming engineers with a deluge of often correlated alerts. Therefore, effective alert aggregation is crucial in isolating root causes and accelerating failure resolution. Existing approaches typically rely on either semantic similarity or statistical methods, both of which have significant limitations, such as ignoring causal relationships or struggling to handle infrequent alerts. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a novel two-phase alert aggregation approach. We employ temporal–spatial clustering to group alerts based on their temporal proximity and spatial attributes. In the second phase, we utilize large language models to trace the cascading effects of service failures and aggregate alerts that share the same root cause. Experimental evaluations on datasets from real-world cloud platforms demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving superior performance compared to traditional aggregation techniques.",
