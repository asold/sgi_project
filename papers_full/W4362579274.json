INTRODUCTION  \nThe need for electrical energy in Indonesia is increasing along with technology and industry \ndevelopment. The existing electric power system must always be considered and developed to ensure the \navailability of electrical energy. One of the crucial parts of the electrical power system is the transformer, yet \nneglecting it can result in overheating, corona, and arcing, affecting how well the transformer performs. The \noil in the transformer function s as a coolant and insulator. The presence of gas in the transformer oil might \npotentially result in failure of the transformer. The impact of failure on the transformer is ascertained using \nthe dissolved gas analysis technique. A dissolved gas analysis (D GA) test is performed to evaluate the \ntransformer’s condition [1]. \nDue to the breakdown of insulating oil and paper, the DGA method uses different concentrations of \ndissolved gases in transformer oil. DGA has become widely accepted as a technique for identifying \ntransformer defects that are only beginning [1]. The gas produced and the usual or dominating gas at different \ntemperatures can be used to identify faults in transformer oil. These gases include methane (CH 4), hydrogen \n(H2), ethane (C 2H6), ethylene (C 2H4), acetylene (C 2H2), carbon dioxide (CO 2), and carbon monoxide (CO) \n[2]. When the transformer works continuously, it causes the compound to break up into C -H elements. The \nformation of these hydrocarbon gases causes thermal failure, partial discharge, and arcing, which can trigger \n\nInt J Elec & Comp Eng  ISSN: 2088-8708  \n \nAnalysis of interference methods on transformers based on the results of dissolved gas … (Yulianta Siregar) \n3673 \nfires. DGA is a technique for determining the  quantities or values of the hydrocarbon gases produced due to \nthese anomalies. \nPrevious studies on DGA, such as oil-immersed power transformer fault diagnosis using DGA. \nAccording to the interpretation of IEEE Standard 2008 -C57.104 (total dissolved combus tible gas (TDCG), \nKey gas method, Doernenburg ratio, and Rogers ratio), DGA testing is used in this study to determine the \ntype of defect in the transformer power. And then IEC 2015 -60599 (Duval triangle, basic gas ratio, and \nCO2/CO ratio). This experiment  still found thermal failure in the power transformer [3]. “Duval triangle and \nRogers ratio prediction used for the analysis of 132/33 kV 15 MVA power transformer dissolved gas using \nthe Transport-X Kelman Kit”, it researched power transformers using the dissolved gas analysis method. The \nDGA method used in this study is the Duval triangle and Rogers ratio. The results obtained are that in sample \nI, there is an indication of thermal failure due to an increase in oil temperature above 700  °C, and in sample II \nthere is no indication of failure [4]. “Using traditional methods, dissolved gas analysis and evaluati on in \nelectric power transformers”, researched dissolved gas analysis using conventional methods. In this study, a \ncomparison of several dissolved gas analysis methods was carried out. Key gas method, Doernenburg ratio, \nRogers ratio, IEC 60599, Duval trian gles, Duval pentagons, and Mansour pentagons are some techniques \nemployed. Low energy discharge (D1), high energy discharge (D2), partial discharge (PD), low overheating \n(T1), medium overheating (T2), and high overheating (T3) are the classifications of fa ilures employed in this \ncomparative approach. The findings demonstrate that the best techniques for more thorough fault diagnostics \nin transformers are Duval pentagons and Duval triangles [5]. “Case studies for the diagnosis of transformer \nfaults using dissolved gas analysis, ” study on the application of the di ssolved gas analysis technique to \ndiagnose transformer failure. This research uses the key gas method, the Doernenburg ratio, and the Rogers \nratio [6]. In this study, data were taken from 2 case studies. The first case study is a 250 MVA, 15.75/420 kV, \n3-phase transformer with an oil forced air forced (OFAF) cooling system. The second case study is a  \n290 MVA, 18/240 kV, 3 -phase transformer with OFAF cooling [7]. The results obtained in case study 1 are \nbased on the key gas method. The transformer experienced a type of electrical partial discharge failure due to \nthe dominance of H 2 gas. Based on the Rogers ratio and Doernenburg ratio method, the transformer \nexperienced a partial discharge failure type. The utility personne l finally confirmed that the transformer \nexperienced a partial discharge type of failure. The results obtained in case study 2 are based on the key gas \nmethod. Due to C 2H2 dominance in the gas, the transformer experienced a thermal -oil fault type. Based on  \nthe Doernenburg ratio method, the transformer experienced a thermal decomposition failure. According to \nthe Rogers ratio approach, the transformer encountered a thermal fault -type failure with t>700  °C. The \ntransformer had a type of thermal fault failure,  which was the conclusion that was finally validated by the \nutility personnel. \nBased on the research described above. In this study, the examination of transformer disturbances \nand the DGA test use the interpretation of the IEEE std 2019 -C57.104 [8] TDCG, key gas, and Rogers ratio), \nIEC 2015 -60599 [9] (Duval triangle and basic gas ratio), and IEEE Std 2019 -C57.104 (Duval pentagon \nmethod) [10], and the research location in power transformer plant (PPTR) at PT. Indonesia Asahan \nAluminum, Indonesia. \n \n \n2. PROPOSED METHOD \n2.1.  Transformer \nA transformer is a static electrical device in which a magnetic circuit and winding consisting of 2 or \nmore windings, by electromagnetic induction, transform power (current and voltage) in an alternating current \n(AC) system to another current a nd voltage system that works at the same frequency. Ampere ’s law and \nFaraday’s induction, which state that changes in current or electric fields can generate magnetic fields and \nthat changes in magnetic fields or magnetic field fluxes can produce induced v oltages, are the \nelectromagnetic principles that the transformer relies on [11]. The electromotive force relationship can be \nused by (1), (2). \n \n𝑒 =  −𝑁\n𝑑𝛷 \n𝑑𝑡  (1) \n \n𝑉𝑝\n𝑉𝑠\n=  \n𝑁𝑝\n𝑁𝑠\n=  \n𝐼𝑠\n𝐼𝑝\n (2) \n \nIn (1) and (2),  𝑁 is number of turns, 𝑒 is electromotive force (Volt), \n𝑑Φ \n𝑑𝑡  is rate of change of magnetic flux \n(Weber/sec). \n \n \n                ISSN: 2088-8708 \nInt J Elec & Comp Eng, Vol. 13, No. 4, August 2023: 3672-3685 \n3674 \n2.2.  DGA evaluation using total dissolved combustible gas \nThe entire volume of combustible gas produced is used in the TDCG method to assess the failure of \ntransformer insulating materials. In this strategy, the total gas volume is a proxy for the transformer \ndisturbance. According to this approach, there are four states for the transformer depending on the gas \nvolume. The metrics used to gauge the transformer ’s condition are based on the concentration of each gas \nseparately and the sum of all combustible gas concentrations. The value of the dissolved gas concentration \nlimit to assess the condition of the transformer oil is shown in Table 1 [12]. \nThe TDCG method in each condition is based on the condition and disturbance in the transformer. The \nexplanation of each condition of the TDCG method is as follows [10]. The transformer is in good working order \nif the TDCG is below this threshold in condition 1. An investigation must be conducted immediately if one of \nthe gases exceeds this level limit. The fact t hat condition 2 is TDCG at this concentration means that the \nexplosive gas level has risen above the safe limit. An investigation needs to be done immediately if any of the \ngases surpass the limit at this level. To obtain the trend, behave following the procedure (tendency). There may \nhave been a disruption in this state. At this level, condition 3 is TDCG, which denotes a high degree of \ndecomposition. Immediately after noticing that one of the gases has exceeded this threshold limit, an \ninvestigation is co nducted. There may have been a disruption in this state. Condition 4 is TDCG that has \nexceeded this limit indicates that there has been a very high level of deterioration. If we continue to operate \ndirectly on the transformer, it can cause damage to the transformer [13]. \n \n \nTable 1.

Calculation of combustible gas formation rate \nCalculating the rate of explosive gas production is crucial since it affects the transformer’s stability. \nThe rate at which flammable gas formation occurs >2.8 L (0.1 ft 3) per day in the transformer may indicate \nthat the transformer is experiencing an internal active fault. Take the sum of the concentrations [ L/L (ppm)] \nof all combust ible gases (all but CO 2, O2, and N 2) in the first and second samples to determine the rate of \nevolution of combustible gases, then use (3) [12]–[14]. \n \n𝑅 =  \n(𝑆𝑇−𝑆0)𝑥 𝑉 𝑥 10−6\n𝑇  (3) \n \nwhere 𝑅 is gas formation rate (liter/day), S0 is first sample (microliter/liter or ppm),  ST is second sample \n(microliter/liter or ppm), 𝑉 is oil volume (liters), 𝑇 is time (day). \n \n2.4.  Key gas method \nTo evaluate the failure, this key gas approach needs six primary gas concentrations, including H 2, \nCH4, C2H2, C 2H4, and C 2H6, as well as CO. The compositi on of the greatest individual gas amount \ndetermines whether the transformer will fail using the key gas approach. Four categories of failures in \ntransformers using the key gas approach are recognized: electrical partial discharge, electrical arcing, thermal \noil, and thermal cellulose [15], [16]. \n \n%𝐶2𝐻4 =  \n100𝐶2𝐻4\n𝐶𝑂+ 𝐻2+ 𝐶𝐻4+ 𝐶2𝐻6+ 𝐶2𝐻4+ 𝐶2𝐻2\n (4) \n \n%𝐶𝑂 =  \n100𝐶𝑂\n𝐶𝑂+ 𝐻2+ 𝐶𝐻4+ 𝐶2𝐻6+ 𝐶2𝐻4+ 𝐶2𝐻2\n (5) \n \n%𝐻2 =  \n100𝐻2\n𝐶𝑂+ 𝐻2+ 𝐶𝐻4+ 𝐶2𝐻6+ 𝐶2𝐻4+ 𝐶2𝐻2\n (6) \n \n%C2H2 =  \n100C2H2\nCO+ H2+ CH4+ C2H6+ C2H4+ C2H2\n (7) \nInt J Elec & Comp Eng  ISSN: 2088-8708  \n \nAnalysis of interference methods on transformers based on the results of dissolved gas … (Yulianta Siregar) \n3675 \n2.5.  Rogers ratio method \nThe rate of formation of combustible gas is an important calculation to determine the rate of \nformation of gas that can cause disturbances in the transformer. A combustible gas generation  rate of >2.8 L \n(0.1 ft3) per day in the transformer may indicate that the transformer is experiencing an internal active fault, \nas shown in Table 2 [3], [5]. Meanwhile, three ratios are used in this approach, namely (R1, R2, and  R5). The \nlink between the outcomes of numerous failure investigations and gas analysis for each case demonstrates the \nvalidity of this methodology. Values for the three primary gas ratios that correspond to the recommended \ndiagnosis are shown in Table 3 [16]. \n \n \nTable 2.

Duval triangle method \nThe values of three gases, CH 4, C 2H4, and C 2H2, are used as parameters in the Duval triangle \nmethod. The percentage value of each gas is transformed into the triangle coordinates. In this method, three \ntypes of failure can be detected: the failure zone is comprised of partial discharge, electrical fai lure (high and \nlow arcing energy values), and thermal failure hotspots from various temperature ranges. In this method, the \nstandard in IEC 60599 is used in a Duval triangle, as seen in Figure 1 [17]. \nThe size of the intersection of the three coordinates based on the value representation of CH 4, C2H4, \nand C2H2 will serve as a proxy for the type of failure in the Duval triangle technique. These coordinates can \nbe determined based on the formula in the following (8 )-(10). In this abbreviation : 𝑃𝐷 is partial discharge, \n𝐷𝑇 is combination of thermal fault  and discharge, 𝐷1 is discharge o f low energy, 𝑇1 is thermal f ault,  \nt<300 C, 𝐷2 is discharge o f high energy, 𝑇2 is thermal fault , 300  C<t<700 C, 𝑇3 is thermal f ault,  \nt>700 C.

METHOD \nIn this study, data from the DGA test findings in the form of gas concentrations H 2, CH 4, C 2H2, \nC2H4, C2H6, and CO dissolved in transformer oil were collected as part of the study technique. After data \ncollection is complete, the analysis of the results of the DGA test and ev aluation of disturbances in the \ntransformer is carried out. Analysis of the DGA test findings and assessment of transformer faults using the \ninterpretation of IEEE std 2008 -C57.104 [10] (TDCG, Key gas, and Rogers ratio), IEC 2015 -60599 [9], [23] \n(Duval triangle and basic gas ratio), and IEEE Std 2019 -C57.104 [8] (Duval pentagon). The instrument used \nin this study is the portable dissolved gas analysis general electric (GE) Kelman Transport X. The \ninformation about the PPTR of PT Indonesia Asahan Aluminum comes from the results of the DGA tests.  \nThe instrument used in this research is general electric Kelman Transport X, as seen in Figure 3. \ngeneral electric Kelman Transport X uses the photo -acoustic spectroscopy method to perform DGA analysis \nwith very high quality [4], [24], [25] . This tool can also provide measurements of all gases and their \nhumidity. The gas extracted from the oil sample was measured using the infrared photo -acoustic \nspectroscopy method (semiconductor sens or for hydrogen). The specifications of the general electric Kelman \nTransport X as shown in Table 6. \nThe supplied sample bottle is equipped with a lid assembly, as shown in Figure 4. It incorporates an \nairtight compression fitting and a temperature probe e quipped with a humidity sensor, all of which must be \nconnected to the top panel of Transport X. Two Teflon-coated magnetic stirrers are provided; place one in the \nbottle before screwing the cap on. This magnet will be rotated in the bottle during the analy sis cycle. Its \npresence is essential for the accurate operation of Transport X. Teflon -coated magnets should also be cleaned \nafter each test. After use, the Teflon -coated magnets can be removed from the oil in the bottle using the \nsupplied magnet retriever . In-line Teflon Filters are installed in the return and intake gas pipes.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  \n4.1.  Transformer failure evaluation based on TDCG method \nTable 8 displays the outcomes of the DGA test performed on a 48 MVA power transformer. The \noutcomes of the DGA test show that the gas CH 4 and C2H6 have passed the limit of condition 1. DGA results \nalso show that the gas level C2H6 has reached condition 4, which indicates that there has been deterioration in \nthe transformer and a high risk of damage to the power transformer. The outcomes of the DGA test also show \nthat the TDCG values in the first and second samples have reached condition 2. Other methods can find the \nresults of this type of failure indication, and the concentration of each flammable gas dissolved in transformer \noil is monitored by this TDCG method. \n \n \nTable 8.

This is because the \ntransformer overhaul and oil filtration were carried out the day before. These results indicate that the oil \nfiltration process has been successfully carried out, namely with a low concentration of combu stible gas \nvalues. The results of this filtration are also only temporary after the filtration process must be re -checked on \nthe transformer parts, especially transformer isolation, according to the type of failure indication obtained.  \n \n4.2.  Transformer failure evaluation based on key gas method \nFigure 5 displays the outcomes of the DGA analysis using the key gas approach. The analysis of the \nkey gas method results, namely on the  January 23, 2020 sample, obtained a presentation of 1.6546% C 2H4; \n6.41158% CO; 3.51603% H 2, and 0% C 2 H2. In the  August 14, 2020 sample, the presentation was 1.2891% \nC2H4, 7.4585% CO, 0.4604% H2 and 0% C2H2.  \n \n4.3.  Transformer failure evaluation based on Rogers ratio method \nAccording to the results of computations using the standard in Table 9 and the Rogers ratio method, \nthe Rogers ratio approach cannot identify disturbances in this situation. In the calculation obtained, namely \n                ISSN: 2088-8708 \nInt J Elec & Comp Eng, Vol. 13, No. 4, August 2023: 3672-3685 \n3680 \nR2<0.1, R1>1, the calculation results lead to cases 4 and 5.

Transformer failure evaluation based on Duval triangle method \nAfter calculating (1) -(3), the results of the relative presence of each gas are obtained, as shown in \nTable 10. After obtaining the presentation value of each gas, the transformation is carried out to triangular \ncoordinates to facilitate the representation of the results in the MATLAB application. The calculation results \nare then converted into triangular coordinat es according to (4) to facilitate visualization in the MATLAB \napplication. The calculation results on the  January 23, 2020 sample, namely (56.95 74.55 1) and the  \nAugust 14, 2020 sample, are (53.34 80.79 1). Figure s 6(a) and (b) shows a visualization of th e Duval triangle \nmethod using the MATLAB application. The red dot in the image is the coordinates of the type of \ndisturbance. The results of January  23, 2020 and August  14, 2020 are disturbances in the T1 zone. The T1 \nzone indicates that the transformer is  experiencing a thermal fault (t<300  C). Indications of thermal \ndisturbance t<300 C occur due to discharge caused by air trapped in the insulation system and overheating \nthe conductor wire insulation. \n \n \nTable 10.

Transformer failure evaluation based on basic gas method \nThe basic gas method calculation is almost the same as the Rogers ratio method.

The results obtained are in the samples of  January 23, 2020 \nand August  14, 2020.

Transformer failure evaluation based on Duval pentagon method \nAfter calculating (5) -(9), the results of the relative presence of each gas are obtained, as shown in \nTable 12. After obtaining the relative percentage of each gas, the coordinates of each gas a re determined \nusing (10) and (11), as shown in Table 13. Further, after obtaining the coordinates of each gas, the next step \nis to find the area of the point and the center point (centroid) of the combined points that form a pentagon \nbased on (12)-(14), as shown in Table 14. \nAfter obtaining the centroid value of each sample, the coordinates are visualized into three pentagon \nmethods, namely Duval pentagon 1, Duval pentagon 2, and combine Duval pentagons, as shown in  \nFigures 7(a) to (c). Based on calculatio ns using the Duval pentagon method, the results of the centroid \ncoordinates are Cx=-27.67 and Cy=6.57 [4].

The results obtained are the three types of Duval pentagon used: Duval pentagon 1, Duval \npentagon 2, and Combined Duval pentagon. It is found that the transformer experiences str ay gassing in oil at \ntemperatures of 120  °C and 200  °C. A stray gassing condition is where there are gases in the normal \ntransformer operation. The presence of an S zone (stray gassing) increases the ability of the Duval pentagon \nmethod to determine the normal aging of transformer insulation, as seen in Figure 7.  \n \n \nTable 12.

CONCLUSION \nThe study’s findings led to the following conclusions: The first, the TDCG method shows that gas \nlevels such as C2H6 and CH4 have exceeded the normal limit. According to the standard rate of gas evolution, \nthe presence of CH4 gas, which is already in condition 2, and C 2H6, which is already in condition 4, indicates \nthat the PPTR 1 transformer with serial number 80900075 in the electricity distribution section of PT Inalum \nhas experienced a hot spot on the transformer at a temperature >200  C. Following this result, the key gas \nmethod gives the results of a thermal cellulose diagnosis. The relative concentrations of the two main CO 2 \nand CO g ases lead to the failure state of cellulose thermal insulation. The dominance of CO and CO 2 gases \nindicate the decomposition of PPTR 1 transformer insulation paper with serial number 80900075 due to the \ntransformer insulating paper has become more heated. However, the Rogers ratio method cannot identify the \ndisturbance that occurs, but the results are close to cases 4 and 5. Cases 4 and 5 in the roger ratio method are \na condition of thermal failure caused by an increase in temperature. This has the disadvan tage of the open \nmethod. It is a possibility that the results are outside the range specified by the standard. Furthermore, the \n\n                ISSN: 2088-8708 \nInt J Elec & Comp Eng, Vol. 13, No. 4, August 2023: 3672-3685 \n3684 \nDuval triangle method provides a diagnosis of thermal fault results T1 (t<300  C) on the samples of January  \n23, 2020 and  August 14, 2020. This condition states that the PPTR 1 transformer with serial number \n80900075 has a hot spot with a temperature range of 160 C<t<300 C. The visual indication in the T1 fault \nis that the transformer paper insulation changes colo r to brown at a temperature >200  C. Meanwhile, the \nbasic gas method gives the result of T1 disturbance, namely thermal disturbance with (t<300  C). This \ncondition states that the PPTR 1 transformer with serial number 80900075 has a hot spot with a tempera ture \nrange of 160 C<t<300 C. Hot spots on the transformer can occur around the windings of the transformer. \nThe visual indication in the T1 fault is that the transformer paper insulation changes color to brown at a \ntemperature >200  °C. After that, tests using the Duval pentagon method showed that each sample of the \ntransformer indicated stray gassing (120 C<t<300 C) in the oil. The stray gassing condition indicates that \nthe PPTR 1 transformer with serial number 80900075 has a hot spot with a temperature  range of  \n120 C<t<300 C. Then, The Duval pentagon method can identify faults better because this method uses five \ngas concentrations at once in the fault identification process so that it has more fault classifications and can \nidentify normal aging in t ransformer oil. The last conclusion, after doing the DGA analysis with several \nmethods described above, it was found that each DGA method stated that the transformer had an increase in \ntemperature, which was above normal temperature. According to the findi ngs of the examination of the \ntechniques employed, after cutting the operational temperature range of the transformer into slices, it is found \nthat the PPTR 1 transformer with serial number 80900075 in the electricity distribution section of PT . Inalum \nhas a hot spot with a temperature range of 160 C<t<200 C. The transformer coil has the hotspot with the \nhighest temperature, which is located between the coil and the iron core at the highest transformer load. The \nload and ambient temperature have an impact  on the hot -spot temperature. An increase in ambient \ntemperature, the way the transformer is loaded, and an insufficient cooling system can all cause the working \ntemperature of the transformer to rise. \n \n \nREFERENCES \n[1] N.
