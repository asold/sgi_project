INTRODUCTION   \nNetwork and internet technology has grown in advance for \nvarious applications such as social media platforms, e -Health \ncare, T elemedicine [1], e -banking, etc . On one end, the \ntransmission of multimedia data such as audio, text, video, and \nthe image growth rate increased, on the other hand, \nmultimedia data tampering has also been increased. Resulting \nto this, protecting multimedia  data in digital networks has \nbecome a major problem. Security is a top concern in \nmultimedia platforms across various applications, including \nContent Authentication, Proof of Ownership, and Copyright \nProtection. To secure digital multimedia, cryptography [2], \nsteganography [ 3], and watermarking [4] techniques are \nintroduced. Among that watermarking showed a state-of-the-\nart method in data embedding, and also it has significant to \nprove ownership, copyright protection, and multimedia data \nauthentication. Digital watermarking techniques are generally \nprocessed on two domains  [5]: Pixel -Based domain and \nFrequency-Based domain. To transform the image in the \nfrequency domain, techniques such as Discrete Fourier \nTransform (DFT) [6], Quaternion Curvelet Transform (QCT) \n[7],  Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) [8], Hilbert Transform \n[9], Wavelet Transform [Discrete wavelet (DWT)  [10], \nStationary Wavelet (SWT)  [11], Integer Wavelet Transform \n(IWT) [ 12], Complex Wavelet Transform (CWT)[ 13]], etc.  \nThe hybrid embedding tec hniques are also  been attracted by \nthe researchers to achieve authentication [ 14]. A robust blind \nSWT watermarking technique is proposed by Nagarjuna, P.V. \net al., [11]. The Watermark image is encrypted by XOR \noperation, embedded in the original image’s low -frequency \nstationary wavelet transform (SWT) coefficient values. The \nextraction phase shows higher imperceptibility for tamper \ndetection applications. In addition to the frequency domain, \nmatrix decomposition techniques such as Singular value \ndecomposition (SVD) [10], and QRD decomposition [15]. In \n[15] a QR decomposition (QRD) -based blind watermarking \napproach for colour images is designed. The watermark is \nembedded by altering the 2 -bit per  pixel of each 4×4 QR \nblock, and the watermarked image is downsam pled to the \nCNN to train the image for tamper detection and extracting the \nwatermark. To compute QR matrices, a unique technique \noffered by [ 16] was employed instead of the Gram -Schmidt \napproach. The image is partitioned into blocks before \nwatermark embedding to decrease the extraction time and the \nwatermark embedded in R(1,1) matrix.  The experimental \nfindings reveal that the watermarked images have good \nquality. In [10] DWT-SVD transform is suggested to provide \ncontent authentication.

Whereas in [17], the original \nimage was preprocessed by compressing it using the PCA \ntechnique. The watermark is generated by generating singular \nvalues from both the original and watermark image which are \ncombined to form a new singular matrix . The new singular \nmatrix is a dot product with the original image U and V matrix \nto form a modified LL sub -band which show s acceptable \nresults for copyright application. In recent trends, researchers \nhave strongly recommended ensemble techniques, where deep \nlearning-based watermarking approaches such as DCT -CNN \n[18], DWT-CNN [19], and others demonstrated state -of-the-\nart ways rather than conventional watermarki ng methods. In \nthe deep Learning approach, CNN plays a prominent role in \nclassification, object detection, invariant feature map \nextraction [20], and so on. On the other hand, some researchers \nare concentrated on Neural networks and fuzzy -based \nwatermarking systems [21, 22]. In recent work, the attention-\nbased transformer is slowly getting more performance \nrecognition than CNN in various applications.  CNN's \ndrawback is that hard inductive bias is required to perform \nbetter for small datasets. So , to overcom e this, the hard \ninductive bias usage is avoided by the transformer using a key \ncomponent, which is the attention mechanism [ 23]. \nTransformer designed primarily for natural language \nprocessing (NLP) applications to help with language \ntranslation, image translation, and speech understanding [24]. \nTransformer is a straightforward and parallel processing \nmethod so, the researcher extended this technique to various \ncomputer vision applications like image classification, video, \nand audio processing. T he t ransformer concept is briefly \nexplained in section 2.1. \nThe main contributions of this research are: \n(i) Attempted Transformer model for the first time in the \nfield of watermarking and succeeded in image tampering \napplications. \n(ii) Proposed a novel hybrid technique namel y DWT -QR-\nSWT which has the potential to hold a high -capacity \nwatermark.  \n(iii) Achieved high robustness using data augmentations and \nit is fed to train transformers using rotation, scaling, and \nflipping which produces highly invariant watermark \nfeature map images. \nThe rest of the paper is explained as follows: section 2 explains \nthe preliminary concept, section 3  describes the proposed \nsystem followed by results and discussion in section 4.  \n \n░ 2. PRELIMINARY CONCEPTS \n2.1 Transformer \nThe t ransformer encoder -decoder model was proposed by \nGoogle brain team members in 2017 [24] for various image \ntranslation and Language translation applications. T he \ntransformer encoder-decoder architecture model is co mposed \nof six identical stack layers (i.e., six residual encoder and six \nresidual decoder blocks). T he t ransformer encoder has two \nsub-layers: one is a multi-head self-attention layer; the second \nsub-layer is a feed -forward layer. Each sub -layer is followe d \nby a residual connection and normalization layer. The \npositional embedding information is concatenated with the \nflattened 1D sequence input vector 𝑋𝑖, which is fed as input to \nthe transformer encoder. In the encoder, self -attention \ngenerates a key vector 𝐾𝑖, value vector 𝑉𝑖, and query vector 𝑄𝑖  \nby multiplying each input vector  𝑋𝑖 with three weight \nmatrices 𝑊𝑞𝑘𝑉. The weight matrix will be the same for all the \ninput vector 𝑋i:n sequence. Self -attention computes the dot \nproduct of each query vector 𝑄𝑖 with all key transpose vector \nKi:n and divided by key dimension dk followed by the softmax \nfunction. The self -attention is then multiplied by the \ncorresponding value vectors which give the output vector Self-\nAttention (Q, K, V) as represented in equation (1). The self-\nattention mechanism performs parallelly, where each self -\nattention head is concatenated together as multi-head attention \n(MHA) represented as shown in equation (2). \n \n     Self-Attention (ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑑1)=softmax(\n𝐾𝑖:𝑛𝑇𝑄𝑖\n√𝑑𝐾\n) 𝑉𝑖               (1) \n \n    MultiHead (MHA)=Concat(ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑑1+...,ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑑𝑛)            (2) \n \nWhere ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑑𝑖  = Self-Attention (Q, K, V). Normalized multi-\nhead attention passes to the feed-forward layer. 𝑋𝑖\n′ is fed has \nan input for the next stack encoder and the process continues \nuntil the last encoder block outputs the final encoded data. \n \n     𝑍1 = MHA(Layernorm(𝑋𝑖𝐸))+. . . 𝑋𝑖𝐸 𝑀−1,                  (3) \n \nWhere M=1,2,…n. \n \nThe normalized MHA output is concatenated together and \npassed as input to the MLP classifier of the encoder block to \nobtain learned feature maps eq.6.  \n     𝑍𝑛\n′ = MLP(Layernorm(𝑍1)) +𝑍𝑙,    l=1,2…N     (4) \n                𝑌𝑖=(Layernorm (𝑍𝑛\n′ ))                         (5) \nThe transformer-based decoder has three sub -layers: the first \ntwo layers are masked multi -head attention and norm layer \nfollowed by the residual connection for each sub-layer. Instead \nof self-attention in the decoder masking multi -head attention \nis used to prevent positions from attending to subsequent \npositions. Masked MHA value as well as key -value of the \nencoder is fed to the next multi-head attention layer. The MSA \noutput is given to the feed-forward layer foll owed by linear \nand softmax layers to train and classify the input.  \n \n2.2 QR decomposition \nQR decomposition is a matrix decomposition method that is \nsimilar to the Singular Value Decomposition method [3, 2], \napplied to original image matrix A of size 4×4, which  \ndecomposes into two matrices as eq. (6). \n \n          A= Q R = [q1 q2 q3 q4] [\n𝑟11 𝑟12 𝑟13\n0 𝑟22 𝑟23\n0\n0\n0\n0\n𝑟33\n0\n  \n𝑟14\n𝑟24\n𝑟34\n𝑟44\n]            (6) \n \nwhere Q is an orthogonal matrix and R is an upper triangu lar \nmatrix, q1, q2, q3, q4 are column unitary vector s of the Q \nmatrix. Elements of the Q matrix derived from the columns of \nA by the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process.   \n \n                                                     International Journal of \n                     Electrical and Electronics Research (IJEER) \nOpen Access | Rapid and quality publishing                                           Research Article | Volume 11, Issue 2 | Pages 339-344 | e-ISSN: 2347-470X \n \n341 \nWebsite: www.ijeer.forexjournal.co.in             Multi-image Feature Map-Based Watermarking \nTechniques Using Transformer \nStationary Wavelet Transform \nA new wavelet transform called stationary wavelet t ransform \n(SWT) is applied to the primary watermarked image in the \nsecondary level of embedding. Due to its translation -\ninvariance traits against signal processing attacks, SWT is also \nfrequently referred to as an un-decimated wavelet transform \n[11]. SWT is similar to DWT, additionally SWT level contains \nthe same amount of redundancy. In SWT, instead of down -\nsampling steps, it used a null placing procedure instead of the \ndownsampling [25]. In the proposed method, the LH2 sub -\nband coefficients in the SWT domain are selected as a suitable \nregion to embed for the watermark which doesn’t influence \nthe image quality and maintains better robustness.  \n \n░ 3. PROPOSED WORK    \nIn the proposed method, an enhanced benchmark dataset is fed \ninto the transformer encoder together with them being used to \nfine-tune the transformer model. Image authentication, tamper \ndetection, and recovery, as well as watermark emb edding \ncapabilities, are assessed using multi -image encoder feature \nmaps that are produced as watermarks that are embedded in \nthe cover image. The taxonomy of the suggested model is \nshown in figure 1 , where the dimensionality of the \ntransformer-encoded feature maps is reduced using the PCA \napproach to obtain the final watermarks. The DWT approach \nis applied to the original image at the primary level of \nembedding, as illustrated in fig. 3f. After that, the 8×8  blocks \nof the low -frequency LL sub -band are divi ded up, and each \nblock is then broken down into a QR matrix.  The primary \nwatermarked image is provided by DWT after the first two \nimages are inserted in the Q matrix, followed by inverse QR. \nTwo-level SWT is applied on the primary watermarked image \nat the secondary level of embedding, as illustrated in Figures \n3(d) and 3(e), and the other two watermarks are embedded in \nthe mid-frequency coefficient together with a secret key that \nwas produced randomly. During the extraction phase, two \nlevels of data authentication are verified. F irst, the secret key \nmatches, then the second level of the authentic fingerprint \nimage is extracted from stationary wavelet coefficients and \nmatched with the original watermark. If the image is not \nauthentic, then extract the other embedded images from the Q \nmatrix of low -frequency sub -bands to detect tampered \nregions. The self -recovered image is fed as input to the \ntransformer decoder which extracts the original image.  \nIdentify tampered regions by extracting the other embedded \nimages from the Q matrix of low -frequency sub-bands if the \nimage is not authentic otherwise no extraction process. The \ntransformer decoder receives the extracted self -recovery \nwatermark as input, which produces the exact original image. \n \n3.1 Watermark generation and embedding   \n  To process a 2D image, the image is split into patches ‘P’ of \nfixed size, producing a n N number of patches, where N=  \nHW/𝑃2𝐶, where C stands for the number of channels and P \nstands for patch  size and H & W are the original image \ndimension [23]. T he image patches are linearly flattened \nthrough a linear patch projection layer, the image patches are \nconverted into a vector  𝑋𝑖 along with embedding matrix E as \nshown in eq. (7). Followed by adding positional embedding \ninformation to the linear projection layer results in the final \ninput context vector 𝑍1, as stated in eq. (8),  \n \nTo process the 2D image, the image is d ivided into patches P \nof fixed size resulting in N number of patches N= HW/𝑃2𝐶, \nwhere P represents the height and width of fixed patch size \nand H & W are the size of the original image, C represents the \nnumber of channels [23]. Image patches are linearly flattened \nthrough linear patch projection which converts the image \npatches into matrix E with dimension vector size  𝑋𝑖 as \nrepresented in eq (7).  Adding positional embedding \ninformation to the input sequence vector which produce s the \nfinal input context vector 𝑍1 as shown in eq (8).  \n \n        𝐹𝑖=[ 𝑋1𝐸, 𝑋2𝐸. . . . . . 𝑋𝑛𝐸],                                         (7) \n \n            𝑍1 =  𝐹𝑖   + 𝐸𝑝𝑜𝑠                                                      (8) \n \nwhere X represents the number of vectors, E represents the \nembedding matrix, 𝑍1 represents vectorized context vector \ninput, 𝐸𝑝𝑜𝑠 represents positional embedding. \n \nContext vector 𝑍1 is fed as an input to the transformer encoder. \nTransformer encoder feature maps generation is mentioned in \nequation (1-5) in section 2.1. To reduce the dimensionality of \nthe multi-image watermark feature maps 𝑌𝑖, PCA technique is \napplied to each encoded transformer image that produces the \nfinal watermark image. \n \nAlgorithm  \nWatermark generation  \n1.

RESULT AND DISCUSSION \nThe proposed model is evaluated for various types of attacks \nto verify the robustness and imperceptibility. A benchmark \ndatabase is used to evaluate the proposed model for the \ndetection of image manipulation traces of size 512 × 512, 256 \n× 256. Figure 4 shows a few standard dataset s and sample \nuser-generated images of various sizes. The model is validated \nfor various noise attacks, median filter attacks, and geometric \nattacks. The proposed model is evaluated for various attacks \nlike Salt and pepper noise, Gaussian noise, Rotation, copy -\npaste, and flipping results are shown in Table 1. Figure 3 \nshows the original image, encoded watermark image, \nwatermarked image, stationary wavelet transform image, and \nDiscrete wavelet image. Our pr oposed model presented two \ndifferent wavelets transform along with QR decomposition \nand invariant multi -image watermark features are generated \nusing the Transformer encoder -decoder model. Extracted \nwatermarks are highly invariant against rotation, flipping, and \nscaling attack s. Transformer -based encoded feature map \nshows improved result than deep learning techniques as it \nextracts invariant feature maps. For future work, the \ntransformer model can extend to various applications like \nproof of ownership, and copyright protection. \n \n4.1 Quality Metrics \nVarious metrics are provided here to demonstrate the proposed \nscheme's performance against tamper detection and \nlocalization. The performance evaluated for various attacks \nwas measured by Peak -Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (PS NR) and \nNormalized correlation coefficient (NCC) as represented \nbelow. PSNR (Peak Signal -to-Noise Ratio) [26] evaluates the \nvisual perception  by comparing the difference between the \noriginal image and watermarked image and is deemed to be of \nacceptable quality if the PSNR score is more than 25 to 30 dB. \nThe PSNR is determined by using the following formula: \n \n PSNR =   10log 10 ( \n(𝑀𝑎𝑥−1)2\n[∑  𝑀,𝑁 (𝐼1(𝑚,𝑛)−𝐼2(m,n)2] 1\n𝑀∗𝑁\n)         (9)    \n     \nwhere M and N are the numbers of rows a nd columns in the \ninput images. The robustness of the embedded watermark is \nmeasured using the metric Normalized Correlation \nCoefficient. NCC measures the robustness between the \noriginal watermark and extracted watermark. NCC can be \ncalculated using below shown equation: \n \n             NCC = \n∑ ∑ (|𝑊(𝑖,𝑗)+𝑊′ (𝑖,𝑗)|/2)𝑛𝐾\n𝑗=1\n𝑛𝐿\n𝑖=1\n𝑛𝐿×𝑛𝐾\n                          (10) \n4.2 Comparative Analysis \nThe two -watermark extracted from the watermarked image \nshowed the highest imperceptibility for the recovered image \nwith the PSNR  value of 59.05 dB and robustness attained \nhigh with an NCC value of 0.997. Figure 5 , shows the \nperformance of the existing paper compared with the \nproposed work which show s that watermark feature maps \ngenerated using the transformer model attained high \nrobustness and imperceptibility. \n \n \n \nFigure 1:  Taxonomy of Proposed Architecture \n \n \n \nFigure 2:  Transformer Encoder-Decoder Architecture \n\n                                                     International Journal of \n                     Electrical and Electronics Research (IJEER) \nOpen Access | Rapid and quality publishing                                           Research Article | Volume 11, Issue 2 | Pages 339-344 | e-ISSN: 2347-470X \n \n343 \nWebsite: www.ijeer.forexjournal.co.in             Multi-image Feature Map-Based Watermarking \nTechniques Using Transformer \n                 \n                     (a)                          (b)                             (c)                         \n    \n                    (d)                                   (e)                               (f)                                     \nFigure 3: a) Original Image, b) Watermark Image, c) Watermarked \nImage d) 1-Level Stationary wavelet transform, e) 2-Level \nStationary wavelet transform, f) Discrete Wavelet transform \n \n                  \n         (a)                  (b)                (c)              (d)                    (e)                                               \n     \n              (f)                     (g)                     (h)                          (i) \nFigure 4: Sample images of Standard dataset (a-e), (f-i) User \nGenerated Images \n \n \n \nFigure 5: Comparative Analysis of existing works Vs Proposed \n \n░Table 1: Result on various Tampered images and its result \nWatermarked \nImage \nAttacks &Tampered \nImage \nTamper \ndetection \nExtracted WM1 \nWith NCC value \nExtracted WM2 \nWith NCC value \nRecovered \nImage \nPSNR for \nrecovered \nimage \n \nCopy-Paste Image \n \n NCC = 0.97 NCC = 0.989 \n \n56.45 dB \n \nImage Splicing/Cropping \n   \nNCC = 0.97 \n \nNCC = 0.989  \n56.45 dB \n Flipped Image  \n    \nNCC = 0.987 \n \nNCC = 0.98  \n49.02 dB \n Rotated 45ᵒ     \nNCC = 0.974 \n \nNCC = 0.9762 \n \n \n55.30 dB \n \n Rotated 65ᵒ   NCC = 0.982 \n \nNCC = 0.982  \n55.2 dB \n \n \nSalt & Pepper Noise \n   \nNCC = 0.97 NCC = 0.97 \n \n \n58.45 dB \n \n \nGaussian Noise \n \n \n   \nNCC = 0.964 \n \nNCC = 0.98  \n59.05 dB \n \n \nMedian Filter  \n  \nNCC = 0.95  \nNCC = 0.952  \n52.4 dB \n \n\n                                                     International Journal of \n                     Electrical and Electronics Research (IJEER) \nOpen Access | Rapid and quality publishing                                           Research Article | Volume 11, Issue 2 | Pages 339-344 | e-ISSN: 2347-470X \n \n344 \nWebsite: www.ijeer.forexjournal.co.in             Multi-image Feature Map-Based Watermarking \nTechniques Using Transformer \n░ 5. CONCLUSION \nIn digital media platforms securing images from manipulation \nis a challenging task in the real world. Watermarking \ntechnique laid a path for digital data to be secured against \nvarious appl ications like Authentica tion and Tamper \ndetection. The a ttention-based model shows more \nperformance than state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. \nWe have attempted the transformer model for the first time for \nwatermarking applications and succeeded with higher results. \nOur proposed model presented two different wavelets \ntransform along with QR decomposition and invariant multi -\nimage watermark features are generated using the Transformer \nencoder-decoder model. Extracted watermark s are highly \ninvariant agai nst rotation, flipping, and scaling attack s. \nTransformer-based encoded feature map shows improved \nresult than deep learning techniques as it extracts invariant \nfeature maps. For future work, the transformer model can \nextended to various applications like proof of ownership, and \ncopyright protection.  Also, the complexity of transformer \nmodel can be reduced by modifying attentions into linear \nattentions. \n \n░ REFERENCES \n[1] N. Shyamala and D. S.
