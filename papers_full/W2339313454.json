This paper reports an action research attempt to integrate Instagram as \nan active mLearning tool in a language bridge program. Instagram was used \nas a production tool for a holiday project and two writing activities in two pre-\nintermediate/intermediate ESL classes. Results of the study suggest that although \nstudents were not enthusiastic with the initiative at first, they gradually welcomed \nthe idea and were encouraged to be creative in completing their writing activities. \nA few teaching implications were concluded from this experiment for a better \nintegration of Instagram as a learning tool in language classrooms.\nKeywords: Instagram, language learning, social media, mLearning, SAMR model \nSebah Al-Ali\nHigher Colleges of Technology, Sharjah, UAE\nSocial media is a term used to refer to a set of Web 2.0 e-platforms used to “socialize, \ngossip, share information, and hang out” (Boyd, 2014, p. 6) with other platform users, \non different levels. Examples of these platforms include, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, \nand LinkedIn. These platforms are heavily accessed by younger generations (Counts & \nFisher, 2010; Dunn, 2013; Lunden, 2014; Oliveira, 2014). Although most social media \noutlets have a Web version, they are heavily accessed via mobile technologies: smart \nphones and tablets (Global Digital Statistics, 2014). \nSince its introduction, social media have been integrated in classrooms and implemented \nfor learning purposes in various ways (Gikas & Grant, 2013; Mao, 2014). In fact, Seaman \nand Tinti-Kane (2013) report in their survey that there is an increase in using social media \ntools in classrooms with a majority identifying blogs and wikis as their main social media \nlearning tool. Probably due to its recent introduction to the field, Instagram hasn’t received \nmuch research attention in terms of what it can offer in the learning/teaching process.\nWhat is Instagram?\nInstagram is a social media tool introduced in 2010. It is used to share photos, and \nstarting from mid-2013 Instagram’s services expanded to sharing 15-second videos \n(Press Page, n.d.). It is one of the few social media tools originally designed for mobile \nuse through apps. Using a mobile app, an Instagram user can perform a number of \nfunctions: create accounts, post content (pictures or 15-second videos), apply filters, \nadd captions, tag users, add locations, add hashtags, like content, add comments, \n2\nIssues and Trends in Educational Technology Volume 2, Number 2, Dec. 2014\nbrowse and follow other accounts, check a feed generated by followed accounts, and \nexplore (search for) hashtags/users. Instagram’s web version, however, has very limited \ncapabilities and can be used for limited viewing purposes only (see Table 1). Unlike other \nsocial media tools, Instagram is mainly based on the idea of posting one’s own content. \nRe-sharing functions are not readily available; there is no re-share function in the official \napp, and users cannot legally save others’ pictures.\nTable 1. Availability of Instagram functions via its mobile apps compared to its website\nFunctions Mobile Apps Website\nCreate accounts Available Unavailable \nPost content Available Unavailable \nApply filters Available Unavailable \nAdd captions Available Unavailable \nTag users Available Unavailable \nAdd locations Available Unavailable \nAdd hashtags Available Unavailable \nLike content Available Available\nAdd comments Available Available\nCheck feed Available Available\nBrowse and explore hashtags Available Unavailable \nBrowse and follow accounts Available Available\n \nHow Popular is Instagram?\nInstagram’s popularity around the world can be seen through its statistics. As shared on \nInstagram’s website, in two months after its launch, Instagram reached a million users, \nand in less than a year, 150 million photographs were uploaded to Instagram. It currently \nhas 200 million active users; a bank of 20 billion photographs with an average of 60 million \nphotos a day and an average of 1.6 billion likes a day (Press Page, n.d.). Lunden (2014) \nalso reported that while Facebook is the most commonly used social media platform \naround the world, Instagram is gaining popularity the quickest. This could be partially \nattributed to the fact that many famous figures around the world have active accounts \non Instagram and post regular updates, like Barack Obama (@barackobama), Hamdan \nbin Mohammed (@faz3), Cristiano Ronaldo (@cristiano), and Oprah Winfrey (@oprah). In \naddition to this popular trend, Mao’s (2014) report of students’ attitudes and usage of \nsocial media ranked sharing pictures and videos as one of the top three most common \nusages of social media, one of Instagram’s basic functions.\nInstagram in Language Classrooms\nThere have been multiple studies and research papers investigating the use of various \nsocial media platforms like Facebook (e.g., Bowman & Akcaoglu, 2014; McCarthy, 2010) \nand Twitter (e.g., Krüger-Ross, Waters, & Farewell, 2012; Reed, 2013; Warren & Wakefield, \n2012) in classrooms. Very few if any, however, discuss the use of Instagram in education, \nor in language classrooms. Bell (2013) reported her attempts at using Instagram for \n3\nIssues and Trends in Educational Technology Volume 2, Number 2, Dec. 2014\ncollege students’ field trips in a library science course. Salomon (2013) and Tekulve & \nKelly (2013) also discussed their institutions’ libraries’ successful experience in using \nInstagram to reach their young audience as compared to other social media tools.\nAlthough Instagram has limited functions, it can be useful in language classrooms. \nInstagram offers a plethora of contextualized visual data that can provide aid in language \nclassrooms. These aids are especially useful because they offer visual elements that \ncan cater to visual learners. Also, using Instagram in classrooms can assist in creating \na socially connected community of learners, as the tool itself gives room for students to \ncommunicate and socialize with each other beyond classroom constraints. Socializing \non Instagram is mainly done through the like and comment functions, which are not \ntaken for granted by Instagram users.\nAnother important rationale behind this paper’s call for actively utilizing Instagram as \na language learning tool is that Instagram is a commonly used social media outlet that \nyoung learners are now almost fully immersed in and accustomed to; including it in their \nlearning process can be seen as a form of applying topics learned in class in real life \nenvironments (Vie, 2008). Also, young learners’ familiarity with Instagram can be seen \nas an advantage as it can lessen possible stress caused by integrating unfamiliar tools \ninto learning activities (McBride, 2009). Finally and most importantly, ease of access to \nInstagram and availability in most handheld devices makes it more inviting to consider \nthis platform for use in language classrooms.\nInstagram and SAMR\nSAMR is a theoretical framework that explains the various degrees of technology integration \nin classrooms (Puentedura, 2009). As illustrated in Figure 1, the framework outlines four \nlevels of integration starting with basic substitution where technology is used to replicate \nexisting modes of instruction and ending with a redefinition stage where learners are \nactively shaping their learning experience in ways that can only be done using technology. \nFigure 1: The SAMR model as explained by Puentedura (2009)\n4\nIssues and Trends in Educational Technology Volume 2, Number 2, Dec. 2014\nIn other words, according to this framework, the best utilization of an e-tool in classrooms \noccurs when a tool facilitates active student involvement in the learning process. This \nkind of active involvement is important in the language classroom as it makes learning a \nlanguage more effective, as noted by Hockly (2012).\nA number of studies evaluated the use of different e-tools using this model. Cavanaugh, \nHargis, Kamali, and Soto (2013) examined submissions made to two educational-\ntechnology conferences in which teachers explained their ways to implement iPads as \nlearning tools in their classrooms. Upon examining data using the SAMR scale, they \nfound that teachers’ tendency to reach modification and redefinition levels of technology \nimplementation increased as they gained more experience with iPads in classrooms. \nChell and Dowling (2013) also highlight a few iPad apps that were used by teachers at a \nlanguage bridge program and ranked them according to the model. It was noteworthy that \n the level of integration was not app-specific. A few apps were used by some teachers  \nas substitutes for current modes of instruction while being used at the same time to \nredefine learning by other instructors. One of these apps was Keynote, a presentation \ntool for iPads.When used as a substitute for older teaching modes, Keynote was used \nby teachers to replicate what they used to do without technology: present information \nto their students. On the other hand, Keynote allowed more experienced teachers to \nprovide students with active learning opportunities in which students were asked to \ncreate and present a presentation (or a movie using iMovie) to show their understanding \nof vocabulary items covered in class. Chell and Dowling explain that with such a learning \nexperience, “students became content creators and facilitators, presenting information \nto their peers for learning purposes.” (p. 26)\nAs mentioned previously, although limited research is reported in the literature in regards \nto utilizing Instagram in educational settings, Instagram can facilitate a redefinition of \nlanguage classrooms, as defined in the SAMR model, by allowing students to create \nvideos or take pictures to address their learning objectives. The action research reported \nin this study aimed to see how easily Instagram can be implemented in a language \nclassroom setting to facilitate active learning, or as defined by SAMR, a redefinition \nstage.\nResearch Design\nContext and Participants\nThe Middle Eastern higher education institution in which this study took place adopts a \npositive attitude towards integrating technology in classrooms and encourages/supports \nit by a variety of methods. This project was implemented in two classrooms of the same \nlevel and content with around 20 female students in each. The participants’ age group \nranged from 17 to 21 years old. They were in their first semester of a bridge program that \noffers intensive English lessons to enhance their language skills. Their proficiency levels \nranged from pre-intermediate to intermediate. All of them had access to either a tablet or \na smart phone and a Wi-Fi connection in every class.\n5\nIssues and Trends in Educational Technology Volume 2, Number 2, Dec. 2014\nData Collection and Analysis\nThe main aim of this project was to see how seamlessly Instagram can be integrated as \na mLearning tool without negatively affecting the flow of classes or students’ learning \npreferences. This explains why while activities were generally planned before going into \nclass, each activity was modified on the run in response to students’ feedback and \npreferences. The teacher assigned activities and noted her observations in a reflection \njournal. She also continuously asked for students’ feedback to measure their satisfaction \nlevels with tasks and with the use of Instagram as part of their learning process. Their \nfeedback was instrumental throughout the project as it helped restructure activities to \nbetter suit their preferences and needs. \nSamples from students’ work for activities two and three were later taken from BlackBoard \nLearn, the learning management system at the institution. Samples for the first activity \nwere not documented or kept because of the nature of the activity. Discussion of results \nand implications was reached based on the teacher’s feedback and journal entries, and \nongoing feedback received from students throughout the experiment. A short anonymous \nsurvey was also given to students towards the end of the semester to measure their \nsatisfaction in general with using Instagram as a language mLearning tool. 16 students \nvoluntarily filled it out.\nFindings\nAs dictated by the previously assigned learning outcomes for this level/semester, the \nteacher managed to integrate Instagram as an mLearning tool for 3 language in-class \nactivities targeting speaking, writing, grammar and vocabulary skills. Table 2 summarizes \nthe three activities and the learning tasks involved in each one.\nTable 2. Instagram was used as an mLearning tool for three language learning activities\nActivity - Type \nLanguage \nSkills Learning Tools Learning Tasks \nActivity 1 - \nIndividual work\nSpeaking skills Instagram Take/post 10 pictures to Instagram \nVocabulary \nskills\nKeynote Create/present a presentation using 5 \npictures\nActivity 2 - Group \nwork\nWriting skills Instagram Browse pictures generated for Activity \n1’s content on Instagram and choose \none \nGrammar \nstructures\nWikis (via \nBlackBoard Learn)\nCreate a story and post it with their \npicture to a Wiki\nActivity 3 - Group \nwork\nWriting skills Instagram Take/post a picture to Instagram \nVocabulary \nskills\nWikis (via \nBlackBoard Learn)\nCreate a story and post it with their \npicture to a Wiki\n6\nIssues and Trends in Educational Technology Volume 2, Number 2, Dec. 2014\nActivity 1: Present about your holiday\nFor the first activity, students were asked to choose one of three social media outlets: \nTwitter, Tumblr, or Instagram, to post a daily photograph of something special about \neach day of their 10-day mid-semester holiday. Photographs were meant to be used \nas basis for an in-class speaking activity about their holidays. To make it easier to track \nthese photographs, students were asked to use a unique hashtag that wasn’t previously \nused by others. To avoid any possible cultural conflicts, students were instructed not to \nshow any female faces in their pictures. No further instructions were given.\nUpon surveying students before the break, all of them confirmed that they prefer to use \nInstagram to post their photographs. Accordingly, to encourage students to participate, \nthe teacher created a professional Instagram account to take part in the project and \nstarted posting her own daily pictures during the break. The teacher posted instructions \nfor the project to the assigned hashtag to make sure all students are aware of what they \nneeded to do (see Figure 2).\nBy the end of the holiday, there were 232 posts \nadded to the hashtag. It was noteworthy that \nthere were only 5 English captions in total: \n“Thanks my classmet&friend ❤❤❤,” “I like \nthis name hhhhhhhh  ❤ ,” “with friends,” \n“Wedding in AJ,” and “Let’s draw 🎨.”\nWhen students came back from the holiday, \nthey were asked to choose five pictures from \ntheir own content to prepare for a 2-minute \npresentation about their break. Presentations \nwere prepared and presented in the same \ntwo-hour class. Students who did not post \nany pictures during the break were asked to \nexplore the hashtag to find pictures they could \nrelate to and use for their presentations. They \nwere required to give credit to the owners of \nthese pictures and to ask permission from \nthem before using their pictures.\nThe teacher noted that, unlike previous similar activities, students did not waste a lot \nof their preparation time trying to look for pictures and relating them to their actual \nexperiences. She also noted that ease of access to pictures that were already filtered \nusing Instagram made students focus on the language used rather on content. When \npresenting their holiday experience, students felt proud to share pictures they took \nthemselves, and classmates were encouraged to check pictures on Instagram to like \nthem.\nFigure 2: Instructions posted to Instagram. Note that \nthe hashtag was blurred to maintain students’ privacy \nand anonymity.\n7\nIssues and Trends in Educational Technology Volume 2, Number 2, Dec. 2014\nActivity 2: Write a story about a holiday\nSince content generated for Activity 1 and attached to the associated hashtag was \ncontextualized and relevant to students’ environment, it was feasible to utilize the same \ncontent for an in-class group activity targeting writing and grammar skills. For this activity, \nstudents were put in groups of three and asked to explore the hashtag to pick a picture \nthey found inspiring. Using wikis on BlackBoard, learners were asked to write a story \nabout the picture using language structures that had been covered in class (see Figures \n3 and 4). \nAfter introducing the activity with these instructions to the first class section, it was \nnoticed that students did not explore the hashtag to see other groups’ pictures. Rather, \nthey used their own pictures, and often a picture taken by a socially dominant group \nmember. Having two sections gave the teacher a chance to refine the activity for the \nsecond section based on her first implementation. Accordingly, the second section was \nclearly instructed not to use a picture taken by group members. \nThe teacher encouraged students to post their stories as comments on pictures they \nchose. None, however, chose to do so. When asked for the reason behind this reluctance, \nstudents explained that posting such comments didn’t help their social image, or as a \nstudent said: “It’s embarrassing. My followers will make fun of me” (own translation). \nCompared to similar activities completed without Instagram, it was observed that \nstudents found it easier to compose their stories because they were able to relate to the \nplaces or activities that were captured. Composition wasn’t a matter of generating ideas \nas much as it was about generating language.\nFigure 3: Instructions for the first writing activity using pictures generated for the previous activity.\n8\nIssues and Trends in Educational Technology Volume 2, Number 2, Dec. 2014\nActivity 3: Write a story about a student at college\nThe third activity was very similar to the second one, with slightly different instructions \n(see Figure 4). For this activity, students were given the option to take their own pictures \nfrom around the college and post them to Instagram with their stories. It was noteworthy \nthat all students in both classes chose to take their own pictures and posted them to \nInstagram –although they refused to add their stories as captions or comments for the \nsame reasons mentioned above. Both class sections then used wikis to allow students to \nwork in groups on their stories and share them with others (see Figure 5). Since students \nchose to take their own pictures and because they had the restriction of using words \nfrom their vocabulary list for that week, there were some difficulties with generating ideas \nfor their pictures and stories. Giving them the opportunity to go around the college to \nlook for inspiration, however, helped them generate creative ideas. \nThe teacher noted that students were much more motivated to complete this activity \nthan the previous two activities because they had to take pictures together for it, rather \nthan using older photographs or posts by someone else. They were eager to share \ntheir stories with their classmates, and they all made sure their pictures were properly \ndisplayed as they read their stories. \nFigure 4: An example of a story created for Writing Activity 1 about a picture taken by a student \nthey don’t know from the other section.\n9\nIssues and Trends in Educational Technology Volume 2, Number 2, Dec. 2014\nAttitudinal Surveys\nTowards the end of the semester, an anonymous e-survey was distributed to students with \nthree yes/no questions and one open-ended question to see their general satisfaction \nlevels with using Instagram as an mLearning tool. Only 16 students completed the survey. \nAs shown in Table 3, students seem to generally like the idea of using Instagram for \nlearning purposes. In their answers to the open-ended question asking for suggestions \nFigure 5: Instructions for the second writing activity.\nFigure 6: An example of a story created for Activity 3.\n10\nIssues and Trends in Educational Technology Volume 2, Number 2, Dec. 2014\nto improve the Instagram experience, only two comments were given, “to get better at \nusing it” and “it was nice to use it” (own translation).\nTable 3. Attitudinal survey filled out by students (n=16) \nQuestion Yes No\nDid you like using Instagram for learning purposes in class? 16 (100%) 0\nDid the use of Instagram encourage you to produce quality work? 15 (93.75%) 1 (6.25%)\nDo you think Instagram helped you learn acquired skills in class? 14 ( 87.50%) 2 (12.50%)\nImplementation Difficulties and Limitations \nInstagram is one the most-used social networking tools at the institution. Feeds are \nregularly updated and/or checked throughout the day by participants in this study. As \nHockly (2013) notes, a redefinition can only be possible if there was “a certain amount \nof familiarity with mobile devices on the part of teachers and learners” (p.83). Hence, \nfamiliarity with the tool was an advantage to this project. Familiarity with the tool from \na social aspect, however, did not necessarily transfer to this project –at least at first. \nDuring the first few of days of the first activity, the only account posting to the project \nhashtag was the teacher’s. Students later explained that their reluctance to participate \nat first was attributed to the fact that this was a first of its kind learning activity and \nthey were not sure about the kind of posts they were expected to add or about the \nkind of limitations associated with this learning task. After the teacher had posted a few \nphotographs herself , however, demonstrating the kind of information she expected to \nbe shared, pictures started flowing.\nA difficulty in accessing content was also found due to the fact that many of the students’ \naccounts were private. This meant that only their approved followers could view their \nposts. Accordingly, to view their content that was generated for activities, the teacher \nneeded to follow all of her students’ accounts, which in turn led to the teacher being \nleft with a feed full of irrelevant content that could not be blocked or restricted without \nunfollowing the students’ accounts. And, when students explored the hashtag, they were \nlimited to publicly available pictures because they didn’t necessarily follow everyone \nposting to the hashtag. \nAnother major implementation difficulty was due to the fact that students were using \ntheir own personal accounts. This proved to be a problem because students refused \nto post academic content (whether as captions or comments). When asked for an \nexplanation, students expressed that doing so is considered embarrassing and seen \nto have a negative impact on their social presence on Instagram. This kind of limitation \nmade it difficult for the teacher to extend the last two learning activities by encouraging \nstudents to post comments on each other’s stories to further reinforce the target language \nskills/structures. Personal accounts also made it difficult for the teacher to keep track of \n11\nIssues and Trends in Educational Technology Volume 2, Number 2, Dec. 2014\nstudents as students used nicknames among themselves , which had no identifying bios \nto help the teacher identify students. \nLimitations were also faced in regards to surveying students’ attitudes. The survey was \nintegrated at a final stage of the class to substitute for a focus group. When attempting \nto form a focus group discussing students’ views and attitudes towards using Instagram \nas a learning tool, the teacher couldn’t collect data. Students were mostly silent and only \ngave yes/no answers to discussion prompts. Accordingly, a short survey was designed \nand delivered by email (to eliminate face issues) explaining to students that results of the \nsurvey would only be used for research purposes. Given that students were not familiar \nwith the concept of online surveys, to encourage their participation in the survey, only \nfour questions were used, 3 yes/no questions and one open-ended question asking \nfor their suggestions/comments. An additional statement asked participants to express \ntheir willingness to be interviewed for more information. None accepted.\nDiscussion\nEvaluating these activities according to the SAMR model, it can be seen that they can \nbe classified within the modification or redefinition stages of SAMR (see Table 4). The \nsecond learning activity was modified by Instagram when students were asked to browse \nfor content generated on Instagram rather than produce it themselves; although this \ntask could have been done with a simple Google search or by browsing a magazine, \nusing Instagram modified this activity, allowing students to contextualize the data and \ndelivering familiar content, with which the students could relate.\nTable 4. Analysis of learning activities using the SAMR model  \nActivity Learning Tools Learning Tasks \nSAMR \nclassification \nActivity 1 Instagram Take/post 10 pictures to Instagram redefinition \nKeynote Create/present a presentation using 5 pictures modification \nActivity 2 Instagram Browse pictures generated for activity 1’s content \non Instagram and choose one \nmodification \nWikis (via BlackBoard \nLearn) \nCreate a story and post it with their picture to a \nWiki \nmodification \nActivity 3 Instagram Take/post a picture to Instagram redefinition \nWikis (via BlackBoard \nLearn) \nCreate a story and post it with their picture to a \nWiki \nmodification \nUtilizing Instagram as a production tool for learning activities 1 and 3 facilitated active \nlearning and redefined these learning activities, as students were responsible for \ngenerating their own ideas for their writing tasks and for taking pictures that expressed \ntheir ideas clearly; this could not have been done without the Instagram application. \nStudents also felt responsible for generating content and were encouraged to actively \n12\nIssues and Trends in Educational Technology Volume 2, Number 2, Dec. 2014\nuse it for learning purposes. The use of a unique hashtag for these learning activities also \nallowed content to be openly shared in different classes and gave students an element of \nencouragement, as their audience scope was not limited to their classmates.\nIt can be argued that Instagram helped redefine teaching as well through these activities. \nCollecting materials to help students generate content was a daunting task for the \nteacher: content she brought in usually was not suitable for all students, did not reflect \nwhat students had to offer, or limited the scope of student activity. Instagram, however, \neased the process of providing students with contextualized content they could relate to \nand use to produce further content that made sense to them. In other words, Instagram \nhelped create a more personalized learning experience for students, which Romrell, \nKidder, and Wood (2014) believe to be a vital element of successful mLearning. Students \ndid not complain about a lack of ideas or understanding of the content used to generate \nlanguage. They felt comfortable with the pictures and familiar with them, and they had a \nwide range of options to choose from. This helped them refocus their attention and work \non producing target language structures properly. Also, given the nature of the project \nand the plethora of pictures it generated about various topics, students had limitless \nrelevant choices that they could relate to in different ways or with which to associate an \nincident..\nSimilarly to what Waycott, Sheard, Thompson, and Clerehan (2013) noted in regards to \nuse of social media in class, using Instagram for a project that is not limited to a single \nclass also helped create a stronger community of learners among students in the same \nlevel, but in different sections. Students at the institution where this study took place \nusually do not interact with students from other sections and do not try to socialize with \nthem. As reported in Gikas and Grant (2013) in reference to social media tools, Instagram \ncreated better chances of communication among students. Given that the activities \nimplemented in this experiment were attached to unique hashtags that were used by \nboth sections, Instagram allowed for creating a sense of community, and encouraged \nstudents to go outside of their social comfort zone to meet level-mates who chose their \npictures for stories. This in turn also created a greater sense of achievement and pride \nfor those students whose pictures were chosen by others. It was also remarkable that \nalthough students found it interesting to browse others’ posts, their engagement and \nmotivation levels were much higher when they took pictures themselves to suit the \nactivity on hand. In other words, consuming content, even if it was produced by them \nearlier, was not as motivating as generating content.\nTeaching Implications\nBased on the difficulties experienced in implementing the current study, it seems to be \neasier and more practical to have students create academic Instagram accounts using \nunique usernames, like their university IDs, to be used for learning purposes. These \naccounts may solve the problem of students shying away from posting academic content \nto their social accounts and feeling embarrassed about it. It will also help the teacher \n13\nIssues and Trends in Educational Technology Volume 2, Number 2, Dec. 2014\nto enforce guidelines about the kind of content posted to these accounts. Academic \naccounts will encourage students to keep their accounts open to public, which in turn \nwill make it easier for content to be explored and viewed across sections/classes.\nFrom what was observed in the course of this project, learners did not add captions on \ntheir own when they were not required to do so. This could be because they usually do \nnot post captions (whether in their own language or any other language) with most of \ntheir other personal pictures. As a result, it may be useful to make it clear to learners \nthat captions are recommended and encouraged. Captions in Instagram do not have a \ncharacter limit, but line breaks are not possible.\nIt was also noteworthy that although students were motivated to explore content on \nInstagram or use their own previously posted pictures, they were much more involved \nand motivated when a learning task required them to post a new picture they had taken \nspecifically for that task. It engendered a sense of competition to see who could be the \nmost creative and artistic with their pictures, and it encouraged them to produce creative \ncontent rather than doing the bare minimum to complete an activity.\nConclusion\nDue to its popularity among students, Instagram was utilized as an mLearning tool to \ngenerate content that was used for one speaking activity, and two writing activities \nreinforcing speaking, grammar, writing and vocabulary skills. Using Instagram helped \nredefine the language classroom as it allowed students to generate ideas for their writing \nactivities with contextually-relevant content and offered them a learning experience that \nthey enjoyed.
