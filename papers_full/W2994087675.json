INTRODUCTION\nOil-immersed power transformers are one of the most expen-\nsive and critical components of an electrical system. Despite\nbeing highly-efﬁcient machines, a small fraction of the trans-\nferred power is lost in the form of heat (mainly in the\nwindings), which must be removed. A heat-carrier dielectric\nﬂuid, generally a mineral oil, is used to remove the generated\nheat, and simultaneously provide electrical insulation. This\nliquid circulates around the windings cooling them, and thus\npreventing hotspots that negatively affects to the transformer\nlifetime. The dimensions of these cooling channels depend\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Xiao-Jun Yang\n.\non the dielectric ﬂuid properties, as well as the structural and\nelectrical requirements, [1].\nNumerical techniques such as Computational Fluid\nDynamics (CFD) and Thermal Hydraulic Network Mod-\nelling (THNM) have been used by manufacturers to predict\nand improve the thermal and hydraulic performance of power\ntransformers. While in CFD, the governing principles of\nboth ﬂuid ﬂow and heat transfer are written in the form\nof partial differential equations, that are then replaced by\nalgebraic equations and solved at discrete elements in time\nand space, in THNM, those same governing principles are\nmostly written in the form of simpler algebraic equations that\nrely on analytical and/or empirical coefﬁcients, in particular\nin the ﬂuid domain, where the ﬂow proﬁle is not solved, and\ntherefore, singular phenomena such as hot streaks or ﬂow\nVOLUME 7, 2019 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Santistebanet al.: Thermal Modeling of a Power Transformer Disc Type Winding Immersed\ninversions cannot be easily captured. Although both tech-\nniques have their differences, they tend to be complementary,\nbeing the THNM more attractive for design purposes due to\nits reduced time-to-solution and due to its easier integration\nwith other proprietary algorithms.\nDuring the last two decades, several authors have reported\nthe CFD technique as a relevant tool to investigate and\nimprove the thermal performance of power transformers\nwindings. In the ﬁrst decade, the main purpose of CFD was\nto determine the velocity and temperature proﬁles of a 2-D\nwinding immersed in a mineral oil, [2]–[7]. More recently,\nthe improvement of computational resources has enabled\nthe use of 3-D models to conduct numerical investigations,\nallowing to capture three-dimensional phenomena that are\nimpossible to ﬁnd in 2-D models, [8]–[11]. Furthermore,\nother authors have used both 2-D and 3-D models to better\nunderstand and characterize the thermal-hydraulic perfor-\nmance of the insulation systems (oil and paper) with ester-\nbased oils, [12], [13], as well as to evaluate the cooling\nefﬁciency of several alternative liquids, [14], [15].\nRegarding the THNM technique, the ﬁrst developments\nwere carried out in the 80’s and 90’s. At ﬁrst, those\nefforts resulted in the development of a hydraulic network\nmodel in Cartesian coordinates with uniform disc temper-\natures, [16]–[20]. At the end of the 90’s, a further step\nwas taken by modelling the geometry in cylindrical coordi-\nnates and considering both surface and internal disc tempera-\ntures, [21]. Moreover, other authors have applied the network\nconcept to model the heat ﬂow and the coupling between the\nwinding temperature distribution and the hydraulic network,\n[22]–[27]. Nonetheless, all these models treated the heat ﬂux\nin 1-D, i.e., the heat conduction in both axial and radial\ndirections was not considered. This simpliﬁcation was over-\ncome by other authors, who have applied several numerical\ntechniques to obtain the 2-D temperature distribution of the\nwinding discs, [28]–[35].\nOn the other hand, some authors have reported THNM\nmodels that rely on the calculation of local pressure drop,\nfriction and heat transfer coefﬁcients. Most of these coefﬁ-\ncients have been obtained from correlations that come from\nexperimental data. The suitability of these expressions with\ntransformer oil ﬂow is however not well proved, [36]. On this\naccount, some authors have calculated their own correlations\nbased on CFD simulations performed for transformer oils.\nThis is the so-called CFD calibration. For instance, in 2008,\nZhang et al. determined experimentally two Nusselt corre-\nlations that were later used to calculate the convective heat\ntransfer coefﬁcients for zigzag cooled power transformer\nwindings, [37]. Despite this advancement, some authors\nhave pointed out that these networks were based on expres-\nsions obtained from a limited number of experimental cases\nwith relatively simple ﬂows, such as in papers [36]–[38].\nTo obtain more robust expressions, Wu et al, [36], [38], and\nCoddé et al.[39], have used CFD to extend the numbers of\ncases considered, by creating a large set of two-dimensional\njunction/elbow models.\nFIGURE 1. Disc-type winding geometry with dimensions.\nIn this contribution, a THNM model of a disc-type wind-\ning, previously developed for mineral oil, was used to per-\nform thermal-hydraulic calculations with alternative liquids,\nnamely a natural ester-based oil and a synthetic ester-based\noil. The results were then compared with the respective results\nobtained from 2-D CFD simulations. The objective of this\ncomparison is to assess the accuracy of THNM based on\nthe deviations of the hotspot, the maximum and average disc\ntemperatures and the mass ﬂow rate distribution in the radial\nchannels.\nNext section presents the numerical models developed with\nboth techniques – THNM and CFD. The results of both mod-\nels are then compared and discussed. Finally, the conclusions\nderiving from this comparison are presented.\nII. NUMERICAL MODELS\nAs mentioned above, two different numerical models of the\nselected geometry were developed using CFD and THNM\ntechniques. Geometry, brief description of the methodologies\nof both techniques, common boundary conditions, material\nproperties and cases studied are addressed below.\nA. GEOMETRY\nThe geometry used in [40] is also considered in this paper, see\nFig. 1. This geometry is a section of a disc-type winding with\n16 discs divided into 2 passes. The upstream pass contains\n9 discs and the downstream pass contains 7 discs. There is\n174652 VOLUME 7, 2019\nA. Santistebanet al.: Thermal Modeling of a Power Transformer Disc Type Winding Immersed\nan arrangement of radial spacers with 5 and 3 mm height\nbetween discs, and between discs and washers, respectively.\nAxial spacers with 6 mm width can be found between discs\nand both internal and external insulation.\nB. MODEL BASICS\nFirst thermal modelling technique used in this paper is CFD.\nThis technique is used to solve the partial differential equa-\ntions (PDE) that govern both ﬂuid ﬂow and heat transfer.\nFor incompressible ﬂuid domains, the equations that state\nmass, momentum and energy conservation are (1-3), and for\nsolid domains, the equation that state energy conservation is\nEq. (4).\n∂ρ\n∂t +∇· (ρu)=0 (1)\n∂(ρu)\n∂t +∇·(ρuu)=−∇p+µ\n(\n∇2u\n)\n+g(ρ−ρref ) (2)\n∂(ρcpT )\n∂t +∇·\n(\nρcpuT\n)\n=∇· (k∇T )+SE (3)\n∂(ρcpT )\n∂t =∇· (k∇T )+SE (4)\nwhere ρ, u, p, µ, g, cp, T , k and SE of (1-4) are density, veloc-\nity ﬁeld, pressure, dynamic viscosity, gravity, speciﬁc heat\ncapacity, temperature, thermal conductivity, and volumetric\nheat sources, respectively.\nEqs. (1-3) are solved considering laminar ﬂow in the ﬂuid\ndomain. To determine if the ﬂow is laminar or not, Reynolds\nnumber has to be assessed. In a duct with internal ﬂow, this\nparameter can be calculated using (5). According to [6], for\nRe values below 2100 the said condition holds.\nRe =ρuDh\nµ (5)\nwhere Dh is the hydraulic diameter of the considered\nduct.\nTo solve the PDEs, the geometry must be discretized\ninto smaller elements, which together compose a numerical\nmesh. In this work, the discretization was applied on a 2-D\naxisymmetric model. Several mesh independence tests have\nbeen carried out so as to prove that the inﬂuence of the\nchosen number of elements on the results can be neglected.\nA mesh with approximately 700000 quadrilateral elements\nwas ﬁnally used. Figure 2 presents a detail of the mesh used\nfor the study. The model developed was compared with the\nCFD results presented in [40] and were successfully repli-\ncated. A second-order discretization was applied to avoid\ndiffusion errors and the solver was set with double precision\nin a coupled scheme. The admissible residuals were set to 1e-\n6 for continuity and momentum equations and 1e-9 for energy\nequation. The approximate solution of the PDEs was obtained\nusing the commercial solver ANSYS Fluent R⃝.\nThe second technique used is THNM. This technique relies\non the conservation laws of mass, momentum and energy,\nas in the CFD technique. In THNM models, there is a cou-\npling between two different networks: a hydraulic network\nFIGURE 2. Meshing detail in a T-junction of the CFD model.\nand a thermal network. The establishment of these two net-\nworks stems from the hydraulic-electric analogy and the\nthermal-electric analogy, respectively, [41]. In most THNM\nmodels, the solid domain is solved in the same way as in\na CFD model. This means that both models have the same\nnumerical accuracy when computing the disc temperature\ndistribution if the same numerical mesh is applied. However,\nsince the ﬂuid domain (i.e., the cooling channels domain) is\nnot solved in the same way, deviations between both mod-\nels are inherent. Instead of solving the partial differential\nequations of momentum and energy conservation, THNM\nmodels solve the ﬂuid domain by means of one-dimensional\ncoefﬁcients (e.g., frictional pressure drop coefﬁcients, local\npressure drop coefﬁcients and Nusselt coefﬁcients), which\nhave a major inﬂuence on the magnitude of the deviations\nbetween both models. Figure 3 shows the discretization used\nfor the developed model.\nTHNM relies on two main approaches: fully developed\nﬂow is assumed in the cooling channels and perfect thermal\nand hydraulic mixing is considered in the channels and junc-\ntions of the ﬂuid domain.\nIn THNM models, since frictional and local pressure drops\nare treated separately, i.e., there are distinct expressions\nto compute frictional and local pressure drops, two differ-\nent coefﬁcients must be used. In the case of the frictional\npressure drop, the friction coefﬁcient λ must be accounted\nfor. In isothermal laminar ﬂow, this coefﬁcient is analytical\nand can be expressed as a function of both Poiseuille and\nReynolds number, (6):\nf (Re) = C\nRe (6)\nwhere C is the Poiseuille number and Re is the Reynolds\nnumber.\nVOLUME 7, 2019 174653\nA. Santistebanet al.: Thermal Modeling of a Power Transformer Disc Type Winding Immersed\nFIGURE 3. Geometry discretization applied in THNM model.\nFor local pressure drops, local pressure drop coefﬁcients\ncan be calculated using correlations obtained from exper-\nimental data, as presented in [37], or through data sets\nobtained from CFD simulations, [38], [39]. These two meth-\nods are also used to compute the Nusselt coefﬁcients, [36].\nIn the present work, a thermal and hydraulic CFD cali-\nbrated THNM model is used to investigate how dependent\nboth momentum and heat transfer coefﬁcients are in relation\nto the ﬂuid considered.\nThe presented THNM model was developed independently\nby the authors from the University of Cantabria. However,\nthe local pressure loss coefﬁcients were extracted in close\ncollaboration with EFACEC using the same methodology\napplied in its proprietary THNM model, which is not dis-\ncussed in this work.\nC. BOUNDARY CONDITIONS\nTo compare the results of both CFD and THNM techniques,\nthe same boundary conditions are applied in both models.\nA brief description of these boundary conditions is presented\nhere.\nAll exterior solid walls of the geometric model are consid-\nered adiabatic surfaces, (7).\n−n ·(k∇T ) =0 (7)\nAt all the walls of the cooling channels, the no-slip condi-\ntion is applied, (8).\nuwall =0 (8)\nA constant and uniform heat loss distribution along the\nentire winding is assumed, (9).\nQdisc =Q0 (9)\nAt the inlet of the upstream pass, uniform velocity and\ntemperature proﬁles are considered, (10) and (11).\nuinlet =u0 (10)\nTinlet =T0 (11)\nTABLE 1. Physicochemical properties of the fluids.\nTABLE 2. Cases studied.\nAt the outlet of the downstream pass, a uniform pressure\nproﬁle is considered, (12).\npoutlet =0 (12)\nD. MATERIALS PROPERTIES\nThe physicochemical properties of the ﬂuids involved in the\nphysics considered are shown in Table 1. As can be seen in\nthis table, the temperature dependence of the properties is\nexpressed as a function of the ﬂuid temperature in Kelvin.\nRegarding the solid thermal properties, this material is\nmodelled with an equivalent thermal conductivity. That is,\nthe thermal conduction behavior of the winding discs is\nrepresented using an equivalent radial and axial conductivity\nof 0.646 and 3.751 W/(m·K), respectively, [40].\nIII. CASES STUDIED\nIn this work, the deviations that exist between a CFD model\nand a calibrated THNM model are tested with the geometry\npreviously described. Temperature and mass ﬂow deviations\nwill be computed for mineral oil. Moreover, the accuracy of\nthe same THNM model will be tested for alternative liquids,\nwith the aim of developing a modelling tool that ﬁts for\nmineral oil as well as alternative dielectric liquids.\nTwo different cases have been tested for each ﬂuid in terms\nof the transformer cooling regime. The values considered for\nthe boundary conditions in both cases are extracted from [40].\nThey correspond to typical operating conditions, inlet veloc-\nity and temperature, of an ON and OD power transformer\nimmersed in mineral oil, see Table 2. For the alternative\nﬂuid cases, same inlet velocity and temperature as those for\nmineral oil are considered.\n174654 VOLUME 7, 2019\nA. Santistebanet al.: Thermal Modeling of a Power Transformer Disc Type Winding Immersed\nFIGURE 4. Temperature distribution in the winding. (a) ON case, (b) OD case.\nTABLE 3. Temperatures and their location of the mineral oil.\nSince these conditions have a Re less than 465, the ﬂow\nregime is laminar for all cases. Only the results of the second\npass are analysed. The ﬁrst pass of the winding is taken into\naccount in order to reduce the impact of introducing uniform\nvelocity and temperature proﬁles at the inlet. That is, it could\nbe regarded as a preconditioning pass.\nA. CFD VS THNM WITH MINERAL OIL\nFirst ﬂuid considered for CFD and THNM comparison is\nmineral oil. Figure 4 shows the temperatures obtained in\nthe winding with the CFD model. The highest tempera-\nture region is located in the middle discs in the ON case\nwhereas in the OD case is located in the bottom zone of the\npass.\nThe temperatures, average and hotspot, including the\nhotspot location, computed by CFD and THNM for both ON\nand OD cooling regimes with mineral oil as dielectric ﬂuid\nare presented in Table 3. This table shows a deviation between\nCFD and THNM of +2.3◦C in the average temperature and\n−1.8◦C in the hotspot temperature for the ON case. For the\nOD case, the respective deviations are +3.8◦C and +1.8◦C.\nFrom the foregoing, it can be concluded that the higher\ntemperature deviations occur with the higher velocities. This\ncan be explained as follows: keeping in mind that the higher\nthe ﬂuid velocity is, the less developed the ﬂow is in short\nducts (e.g. the radial channels of the winding), the fulﬁllment\nof the fully developed ﬂow simplifying condition in THNM\nwill worsen with the increase of the liquid velocity. This is\nthe reason why the results of the THNM model increase their\ndeviations in comparison with those of the CFD model with\nthe increase of the inlet velocity. This observation is also\nendorsed when comparing the hotspot location, which was\nwell predicted exclusively for the ON case.\nIn addition, the trends of the average and maximum tem-\nperature proﬁles, shown in Figure 5, are also different. How-\never, a good agreement of the maximum disc temperatures is\nobserved between both types of models. Even more, an over-\nestimation of Tavg is obtained in the THNM model, especially\nfor OD case.\nThe deviations between the temperature proﬁles from CFD\nand THNM are caused by the fact that THNM models are\nnot able to capture local phenomena such as hot streaks\nor non-uniform velocity proﬁles. These effects entail differ-\nences in the heat transfer of each disc, leading to a slightly\ndifferent proﬁle in the case of CFD with respect to the THNM\nproﬁle.\nRegarding the mass ﬂow distribution in the channels, Fig-\nure 6 shows the velocity proﬁles at the inlet of the radial\nchannels. It shows the distortion of the velocity proﬁle at\nthe inlet of these channels caused by the separating ﬂow.\nThe ﬂow at the inlet of radial channels is pushed to the top\npart of the channel. This effect, which is more pronounced at\nhigher velocities, causes a region of low velocity at the bottom\nof these inlets, where the temperature of the ﬂuid locally\nVOLUME 7, 2019 174655\nA.

Finally, Figure 7 shows the mass ﬂow distributions,\nradial channel ﬂow over total ﬂow, for both models and\nregimes, having a good agreement between them.\nThe thermal assumptions of the THNM modelling make\nits temperature proﬁles not match with those of CFD with\nthe same accuracy seen for ﬂow rates.\nNotwithstanding the deviations observed, the accuracy of\nthe presented THNM model agrees with other THNM models\nexisting in the literature, as well as with the instruments and\nprocedures used to experimentally measure these values.\nB. CFD VS THNM WITH ALTERNATIVE LIQUIDS\nBoth winding temperatures, average and hotspot, including\nthe hotspot location, computed by CFD and THNM for both\nON and OD cooling regimes with natural and synthetic ester\nas dielectric ﬂuid are presented in Table 4.\nFIGURE 7. Mass flow distributions for mineral oil.\nFor the natural ester, Table 4 shows a deviation between\nCFD and THNM of +1.2◦C in the average temperature\nand −3.5◦C in the hotspot temperature for the ON case.\nFor the OD case, the respective deviations are +2.5◦C and\n+0.0◦C.\nFor the synthetic ester, Table 4 shows a deviation between\nCFD and THNM of +1.9◦C in the average temperature\nand −2.7◦C in the hotspot temperature for the ON case.\nFor the OD case, the respective deviations are +2.7◦C and\n−0.2◦C.\nFigure 8 shows the temperature distributions in the winding\nobtained for natural and synthetic ester. As in the case of\nmineral oil, the middle discs present the highest temperatures,\nespecially in the ON case. In addition, the effect of hot streaks\nis more highlighted in the ON case.\nAs in the previous case, Figures 9 and 10 show the temper-\nature and mass ﬂow comparisons between the two techniques\nfor the alternative liquids.\nRegarding the temperature distribution, as shown\nin Figure 10, THNM overestimates the average temperatures\nin OD case. However, its agreement in ON case is better.\n174656 VOLUME 7, 2019\nA. Santistebanet al.: Thermal Modeling of a Power Transformer Disc Type Winding Immersed\nFIGURE 8. Temperature distribution in the winding.\nTABLE 4. Temperatures and their location of the alternative liquids.\nLooking at the maximum temperatures, the hotspot temper-\nature in ON case is underestimated whereas in OD case has\ngood accuracy.\nFinally, as can be seen in Figure 10, the mass ﬂows dis-\ntribution of the THNM model has good agreement with the\nCFD results for both liquids and both cooling modes.\nC. MINERAL OIL VS ESTER LIQUIDS COOLING\nPERFORMANCE\nFinally, a comparison of the cooling performance of the\nliquids has been made using THNM results.\nAverage and maximum winding temperatures of the three\nliquids are presented in Table 5. Regarding the ON regime,\nVOLUME 7, 2019 174657\nA. Santistebanet al.: Thermal Modeling of a Power Transformer Disc Type Winding Immersed\nFIGURE 9.

Santistebanet al.: Thermal Modeling of a Power Transformer Disc Type Winding Immersed\nTABLE 5. Average and maximum temperatures of the liquids using THNM.\nFIGURE 11. Pressure drops in both regimes.\nfor maximum winding temperature for both natural and syn-\nthetic esters, respectively.\nHowever, since the ester-based liquids are more viscous\nthan mineral oil, the pressure drop observed in the down-\nstream pass is higher for the alternative ﬂuids, as can be\nseen in Figure 11. An increase of 93.2% and 39.8% of\nthe pressure drop is observed for natural and synthetic\nester respectively in ON regime. Regarding the OD ﬂow\nregime, the increase of the observed pressure drop becomes\n63.3% for natural ester and 29.09% for synthetic ester. As a\nresult of these higher pressure drops the total ﬂow rate will\ndecrease.\nFinally, to properly compare the cooling performance of\nthe different liquids, in the ON case, inlet velocities of the\nalternative ﬂuids have been adjusted until the same pressure\ndrop as that of the mineral oil is obtained. In this way, mineral\noil leads to slightly lower hot-spot temperatures, as can be\nappreciated in Table 6. In fact, synthetic ester produces sim-\nilar temperatures as those of mineral oil and it is the natural\nester the oil that yields higher temperatures: 2.3 ◦C and 1.9 ◦C\nhigher for the average and maximum winding temperatures,\nrespectively.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, two different techniques have been used to com-\npute the thermal behavior of transformers disc type windings.\nThe ﬁrst technique, CFD, computes in detail the temperature\nTABLE 6. Average and maximum temperatures of the liquids using THNM.\nand velocity ﬁelds arising in the transformer winding and its\naccuracy has been proved for years. The second technique,\nTHNM, is a simpliﬁed model that relies on some assumptions\nthat reduces its accuracy but produces results much faster than\nCFD, which makes it an interesting tool, mainly for design\npurposes.\nIn this work, the THNM performance for three ﬂuids (min-\neral oil, natural ester and synthetic ester) subjected to two\ncooling regimes, ON and OD, was compared against CFD.\nIn the case of mineral oil, the THNM model results of\nthe two cooling regimes show that the mass ﬂow distribu-\ntions through the radial channels are similar to the ones\nobtained with CFD. Regarding the temperatures, the devia-\ntions are higher. However, these deviations could be accept-\nable in the range of the operating temperatures. Consequently,\nthe validity of the THNM model is accomplished for mineral\noil.\nThen, the THNM model, which is calibrated for mineral\noil, has been tested with two different alternative ﬂuids,\na natural ester and synthetic ester. In both cases, the accu-\nracy of the temperature results was acceptable since all the\ndeviations are similar to those observed for the mineral oil.\nMoreover, the predicted mass ﬂow distribution through the\nradial channels in the THNM model has a good agreement\nwith the CFD results. Then the calibrated THNM used in\nthis work ﬁts for all three ﬂuids considered. However, more\nresearch is necessary concerning the behavior of alternative\ndielectric liquids such as natural and synthetic esters in a\nfull winding of a power transformer or when considering the\ncomplete cooling circuit. These topics are to be kept in mind\nas the next steps in continuing this line of work.\nWith respect to the cooling performance of the liquids,\nnatural ester gives the lowest average and hotspot tempera-\ntures but with the highest pressure drop. On the other hand,\nmineral oil requires less driving force since it produces the\nlowest pressure drop, but also the highest temperature in the\nwindings. Synthetic ester gives intermediate values, decreas-\ning the temperatures obtained from mineral oil with a lower\nincrease of pressure drop than that of natural ester. However,\nthis study is the ﬁrst step to analyze the cooling performance\nof alternative ﬂuids and more studies in the matter should\nbe carried out, since the viscosity affects the inlet boundary\nconditions.\nSummarizing, the THNM model developed could be used\ndirectly for mineral oil, as well as alternative ﬂuids. In fact,\nthis technique has been used to compare the cooling perfor-\nmance of three different liquids.\nVOLUME 7, 2019 174659\nA.
