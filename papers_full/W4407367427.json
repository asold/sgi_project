  "abstract": "Abstract Background Regular exercise recommendations (ERs) and physical activity (PA) are crucial for the prevention and management of chronic diseases. However, creating effective exercise programs demand substantial time and specialized expertise from both medical and sports professionals. Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, offer a promising solution by helping create personalized ERs. While LLMs show potential, their use in exercise planning remains in its early stages and requires further exploration. Objectives This study aims to systematically review and classify the applications of LLMs in ERs and PA. It also seeks to identify existing gaps and provide insights into future research directions for optimizing LLM integration in personalized health interventions. Methods A scoping review methodology was used to identify studies related to LLM applications in ERs and PA. Literature searches were conducted in Web of Science, PubMed, IEEE, and arXiv for English language papers published up to March 21, 2024. Keywords included LLMs, chatbots, ERs, PA, fitness plan, and related terms. Two independent reviewers (XL and CH) screened and selected studies based on predefined inclusion criteria. Thematic analysis was used to synthesize findings, which were presented narratively. Results An initial search identified 598 papers, of which 1.8% (11/598) of studies were included after screening and applying selection criteria. Of these, ChatGPT-based models were used in 55% (6/11) of the studies. In addition, 73% (8/11) of the studies used expert evaluations and user feedback to assess model usability, and 45% (5/11) of the studies used experimental designs to evaluate LLM interventions in ERs and PA. Key findings indicated that LLMs can generate tailored ERs, save time in clinical practice, and enhance safety by incorporating patient-specific data. They also increased engagement and supported behavior change. This made PA guidance more accessible, especially in remote or underserved communities. Conclusions This review highlights the promising applications of LLMs in ERs and PA but emphasizes that they remain a supplement to human expertise. Expert validation is essential to ensure safety and mitigate risks. Future research should prioritize pilot testing, clinician training programs, and large-scale clinical trials to enhance feasibility, transparency, and ethical integration.",
