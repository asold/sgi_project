Introduction\nThe amount of network traﬃc in the data centers has been\nrapidly increasing due to the widespread use of ICT (infor-\nmation and communication technology) equipment (1) (2).T h e\nenergy and the resource savings in the data centers will con-\ntribute to solving some of our global environmental prob-\nlems. The NTT (Nippon Telegraph and Telephone) Group\nhas been proposing the next generation dc distribution sys-\ntem that goes beyond the conventional 380 V dc distribution\nsystem to realize low–carbon societies\n(3)–(5).\nOne of destinations of the next generation dc distribution\nsystem is the e ﬀective utilization of the renewable energy\nsources. The highly e ﬃcient, the ultra–compact (high power\ndensity) and scalable dc–dc transformer (dcx) is one of key\ncomponents to interface the various voltage classes of the en-\nergy storage devices and the renewable energy sources ﬂexi-\nbly. The multicell dc–dc converter based on the ISOP (Input\nSeries Output Parallel)–IPOS (Input Parallel Output Series)\nconnection topology is suitable for achieving the high scala-\nbility\n(6)–(9). The high power density multicell converter using\nthe low voltage, the low power and the highly integrated cell\nconverters has been already reported to realize the high per-\nformance multicell dcx\n(10).\nTo develop the multicell dcx, the isolated dc–dc cell con-\nverters are indispensable.

However, the\nhigh frequency transformer prevents improving the converter\neﬃciency because the core loss and the winding loss from the\ntransformer increase under the high frequency operation. The\ncapacitive isolation without the high frequency transformer is\none of options to solve this problem\n(11)–(14). The approach us-\ning the capacitively isolated cell converters for the multicell\ndcx has not been discussed, and the feasibility of the dcx has\nnot been reported.\nIn this paper, the capacitively isolated multicell dcx is pro-\nposed. The next generation dc distribution system is intro-\nduced at ﬁrst and the necessity of the highly scalable dcx is\nshown. Then, the detailed conﬁguration of the cell converter\nis described and the impact of the capacitive isolation topol-\nogy on the power loss and the converter volume are discussed\nquantitatively. The dc voltages across the resonant capacitors\nfor isolating the input voltage are also analysed to design the\ncell converter. Finally, the ISOP connected multicell dcx us-\ning two capacitively isolated cell converters is fabricated to\nconﬁrm the validity of the proposed approach.\n2. Multicell DC–DC Transformer for Next Gen-\neration DC Distribution System\n2.1 Concept of Next Generation DC Distribution Sys-\ntem The schematic diagram of the next generation dc\ndistribution system is shown in Fig. 1. The dc distribution\nsystem consists of the following powe electronics converters\nmainly:\n•The front–end ac–dc converter\n•The dc–dc transformer (dcx)\n•The POL (point of load) dc–dc converter\nc⃝2017 The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan. 268\nCapacitively isolated multicell dc–dc transformerʢYusuke Hayashi et al.ʣ\nFig. 1. Conﬁguration of next generation dc distribution system for environmentally friendly data centers (5)\nThe front–end ac–dc converter is utilized for the interface\nwith the ac grid. This converter controls the output dc volt-\nage, improving the power factor at the ac input side. The dcx\nis installed for the isolation and the voltage transformation.\nHere, the function of the voltage regulation is not necessary\nfor the dcx. The various I /O (Input /Output) voltage classes\nof power electronics equipment are connected via the dc–dc\ntransformer. The POL converter is installed in front of the\nICT loads to regulate the load voltage strictly.\nThe ﬂoating grounding system with the high resistances\n(20 kΩto 40 kΩ) is applied for the human safety in the 380 V\ndc distribution system\n(15). As shown in Fig. 1, the ground-\ning wire is connected to both power lines for delivering the\ndc power via 22 kΩresistances. The ground–fault current is\nlimited to 8.7 mA ( =384 V/2/22 kΩ) and this current is sat-\nisﬁed with the speciﬁcation of 10 mA by IEC\n(16).T h e ﬂ o a t -\ning grounding system is attractive for introducing the capaci-\ntively isolated converters because the high resistances for the\ngrounding not only limit the ground–fault current but also\nblock the common mode current derived from the power elec-\ntronics converters.\nIn the next generation dc distribution system, the energy\nstorages and the distributed generators based on the renew-\nable energy sources will be installed in addition to the ICT\nequipment such as the servers and the storages to realize\nthe environmental–friendly power supply system\n(4).T h e I/O\nvoltage classes of these applications are e.g. 384 V , 192 V ,\n48 V and 12 V , and they have di ﬀerent grounding systems.\nThe high power density dcxs for the isolation and the voltage\ntransformation are indispensable in this system, and the high\nscalability of the dcx contributes to the smooth installation of\na lot of renewable power sources and energy storage devices.\n2.2 DC–DC Transformer based on Multicell Con-\nverter Topology The multicell converter topology is one\nof attractive options to discuss the feasibility of the highly ef-\nﬁcient dcx with various voltage transformation ratio such as\n384 V to 12 V , 384 V to 48 V and 384 V to 384 V .\nThe concept of the multicell dcx is shown in Fig. 2. The\ndcx consists of a lot of isolated dc–dc cell converters and\nthese cell converters are connected in ISOP (Input Series\nOutput Parallel) and IPOS (Input Parallel Output Series) to\nachieve the high I/O voltages and the high output power. The\nnon–regulated power converters based on the constant duty\nratio control are applied to the cell converters because the\ndcxs are utilized for the isolation and the voltage transforma-\ntion. The features of the dcx are summarized as follows.\n•The eﬃciency η (%) and the power density D\np (W/cm3)\nFig. 2. Concept of multicell dc–dc transformer based on\nISOP–IPOS connection topology\nof the dcx corresponds to the single cell converter ide-\nally.\n•The I/O voltages of the dcx are designed arbitrarily by\nthe number of cell converters connected in ISOP and\nIPOS.\n•The utilization of the non–regulated dc–dc converters\nachieves the balanced voltage– and current– sharings\namong cell converters without any complicated control\nsystems\n(17).\n•The low voltage stress of the cell converter enables to\nemploy the low–voltage and ultra–low loss semiconduc-\ntor power devices\n(18).\nFrom the aforementioned features, the design of the sin-\ngle cell converter is one of the critical issues to improve the\nperformance of the multicell dcx. In the next section, the de-\ntailed conﬁguration of the cell converter is described.\n3. Capacitively Isolated DC–DC Cell Converter\nfor Multicell DC–DC Transformer\n3.1 Conﬁguration of Isolated DC–DC Cell Converter\nFigure 3(a) shows an example of the circuit conﬁguration\nfor the isolated dc–dc cell converter using the high frequency\ntransformer. The LLC resonant circuit topology is applied to\nthe cell converter here, and this topology achieves high ef-\nﬁciency by the ZVS (zero voltage switching) and the ZCS\n(Zero Current Switching) of the semiconductor power de-\nvices. Because of the low loss generated from the semicon-\nductor devices, the design of the high frequency transformer\naﬀects the converter performance signiﬁcantly. The copper\nloss generated from the windings caused by the magnetic\n269 IEEJ Journal IA, Vol.6, No.4, 2017\nCapacitively isolated multicell dc–dc transformerʢYusuke Hayashi et al.ʣ\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 3. Circuit conﬁgurations of dc–dc cell converter;\n(a) LLC resonant circuit t opology with high frequency\ntransformer, (b) LLC resonant circuit topology with a pair\nof isolation capacitors\ncoupling of the transformer is the crucial issue to improve\nthe eﬃciency, considering the skin e ﬀect and the proximity\neﬀect under the high frequency operation.\nFigure 3(b) shows the circuit conﬁguration of the isolated\ndc–dc cell converter based on the capacitive isolation. The\nstatic and the transient behaviours of the capacitively isolated\ndc–dc converter correspond to the behaviours of the isolated\ndc–dc converter using the high frequency transformer. The\nadvantages of the circuit topology with the capacitive isola-\ntion are as follows.\n•The power losses generated from the magnetic compo-\nnents, especially the copper loss derived from the wind-\nings of the high frequency transformer, can be reduced.\n•The complicated transformer design based on the\nelectro–magnetic analysis is not required to control the\nleakage inductances.\nThe drawbacks of the capacitively isolated dc–dc converter\nare summarized as follows.\n•The voltage transformation ratio ( V\nout/Vin)i st h eﬁ x e d\nvalue of 1/2 for the half–bridge circuit topology and 1/1\nfor the full–bridge circuit topology.\n•The common mode current cannot be blocked. In case\nthat the input terminal Pi2 and the output terminal Po2\nin Fig. 3(b) are connected to the ground, the unexpected\nbehaviors are observed.\nIt is impossible for the single converter with the capacitive\nisolation to achieve the ﬂexible voltage transformation ratio,\nalthough the converter using the transformer achieves various\nratios of the voltage transformation adjusting the turn number\nof the windings of the transformer. The multicell converter\ntopology solves the aforementioned disadvantage. The var-\nious voltage classes of dcx can be developed by connecting\nthe capacitively isolated dc–dc cell converters in ISOP and\nIPOS.\nThe ﬂoating grounding system recommended to the 380 V\ndc distribution system solves the problem about the common\nmode current. The connection of the negative input terminal\nP\ni2 to the ground directly is prohibited and the common mode\ncurrent is limited by the high resistances installed into the\ngrounding system as shown in Fig. 1.\n3.2 Volume and Power Loss Estimation of Passive\nComponents in DC–DC Cell Converter The loss analy-\nsis and the volume estimation has been already carried out for\nthe LLC resonant dc–dc converter using the high frequency\ntransformer\n(19). The circuit conﬁguration corresponded to\nFig. 3(a), and the I /O voltages of the LLC converter were\n384 V and 192 V respectively. The output power was 1.2 kW\nand the switching frequency was 1 MHz. From the experi-\nment, the copper loss and the core loss generated from the\ntransformer X\nfmr occupied 26% and 12% of the total con-\nverter loss respectively. The inﬂuence of the copper loss\nof the transformer was crucial, and the losses from the res-\nonant inductor L\nr and the resonant capacitor Cr were rela-\ntively small. The volume of the transformer was dominant\nand this volume occupied 69.5% of the experimental bread-\nboard. Here, the impacts of the capacitively isolated dc–dc\nconverter on the volume and the power loss are discussed\nbased on the above experimental result.\nIn the capacitively isolated dc–dc converter shown in\nFig. 3(b), the copper loss derived from the magnetizing cur-\nrent through the parallel connected inductor L\nM substitutes\nfor the copper loss which depends on the load current through\nthe primary and the secondary windings of the transformer\nwith the mutual inductance L\nM in Fig. 3(a). The magnetizing\ncurrent is generally smaller than the load current at the rated\noutput power, and the copper loss in the LLC resonant tank\ncan be reduced in the proposed circuit topology.\nThe volume of the parallel inductor LM in Fig. 3(b) is also\nsmaller than the volume of the transformer Xfmr in Fig. 3(a)\nbecause the primary winding rated at the small magnetizing\ncurrent is only necessary for the parallel inductor L\nM.T h e\ndownsized volume also contributes to reducing the core loss\nof the magnetic component.\nFigures 4 and 5 show the experimental results about the\nvolumes and the power losses of the passive components for\nthe LLC resonant converters isolated by the transformer (X\nfmr\nisolated LLC). The estimation results for the converter iso-\nlated by the capacitors (C isolated LLC) are also shown in\nFigs. 4 and 5. The impact of the capacitively isolated con-\nverter topology on achieving the high eﬃciency and the high\npower density can be seen in these ﬁgures.\nIn Fig. 4, the volumes of the transformerX\nfmr, the resonant\ninductor Lr and the resonant capacitor Cr are shown for the\nLLC converter isolated by the transformer. The transformer\nwith the high coupling coe ﬃcient of 0.95 was applied and\nthe resonant inductor was connected externally. The volumes\nof the parallel inductor, two resonant inductors and two res-\nonant capacitors are also shown in Fig. 4 for the converter\nisolated by the capacitors. The transformer and the parallel\ninductor were designed based on the high power density de-\nsign methodology\n(20) (21). The passive components based on\nthe design methodology were illustrated, taking the number\nof components in the LLC resonant tank into account. The\nvolume of the LLC resonant tank can be reduced to 22% by\nthe capacitive isolation topology.\nThe power losses generated from the passive components\nfor the LLC converter isolated by the transformer and the\n270 IEEJ Journal IA, Vol.6, No.4, 2017\nCapacitively isolated multicell dc–dc transformerʢYusuke Hayashi et al.ʣ\nFig. 4.

The\nsymbols of PCu and Pcore mean the copper loss and the core\nloss of the magnetic components respectively. The symbols\nof P\nLr and PCr mean the loss generated from the resonant in-\nductors and the capacitors respectively. These power losses\nfrom the transformer X\nfmr and the inductor LM were calcu-\nlated by using the loss map database(22) (23) and the losses from\nLr and Cr were estimated using the published datasheets. The\nsigniﬁcant copper loss reduction by the small current and the\ndecreased core loss caused by the downsized volume are ex-\npected.\nFrom the aforementioned, the converter topology based on\nthe capacitive isolation becomes one of options to improve\nthe performance of the dcx.\n4.

In the case of the multicell\ndcx using two cell converters, both cell converters were able\nto be designed based on the rated voltage of each cell con-\nverter because the absolute values of the calculated voltages\nwere less than the rated voltages of 48 V . In case the num-\nber of cell converter increases, the isolation voltages across\nthe resonant capacitors also increase. The isolation voltage–\nsharing have to be analysed in advance to realize the suﬃcient\nisolation barrier.\nFig. 11. Experimental appa ratus for ISOP connected\nmulticell dc–dc transformer\nFig. 12. Detailed circuit conﬁguration of multicell dc–\ndc transformer for experiment\n5. Experiment for ISOP Connected Multicell\nDC–DC Transformer Using Two Capacitively\nIsolated Cell Converters\nThe prototype of the multicell dcx was fabricated to show\nthe validity of the aforementioned analysis. Figure 11 shows\nthe photo of the ISOP connected multicell dcx using two ca-\npacitively isolated cell converters. Figure 12 also shows the\ndetailed circuit conﬁguration for the experiment. The rated\ninput voltage of the dcxV\nin was 96 V and the rated input volt-\nages for two cell convertersVi1, Vi2 were 48 V . The rated out-\nput voltage Vout was ideally 24 V because the voltage trans-\nformation ratio of the capacitively isolated cell converter was\n1/2. The 100 V GaN (Gallium Nitride) transistors EPC2016\nfrom EPC were employed to drive the 48 V cell converters\nat the switching frequency of 500 kHz. The resonant circuit\nwas designed to realize the resonant frequency of 560 kHz\nfor accomplishing the soft switching of the transistors. The\nresonant inductances of 200 nH and the resonant capacitors\nof 380 nF which double with the isolation barrier were ap-\nplied to achieve the resonant frequency. The GaN transis-\ntors EPC2001 from EPC were applied for the rectiﬁers at the\nsecondary side, taking the synchronous rectiﬁcation for in-\ncreasing the eﬃciency into account. The parameters for the\nexperiment was based on Table 1 and the detailed parameters\nw e r es h o w ni nT a b l e2 .\nFigure 13 shows the experimental result for the multicell\ndcx. The input voltage V\nin was equally divided to the input\nvoltage of the cell convertersVi1, Vi2 and these voltages were\n48 V , and the output voltageVout was 20 V . The output voltage\nwas much smaller than the rated voltage of 24 V because the\nbody diodes of the transistors were utilized for the rectiﬁers\n274 IEEJ Journal IA, Vol.6, No.4, 2017\nCapacitively isolated multicell dc–dc transformerʢYusuke Hayashi et al.ʣ\nTable 2. Parameters for experiment\nFig. 13. Experimental result for ISOP connected mul-\nticell dc–dc transformer using two capacitively isolated\ndc–dc cell converters\n(QR1k, QR2k, QR3k, QR4k:k =1, 2) without the synchronous\nrectiﬁcation. The body diode of each transistor for the recti-\nﬁcation had the forward voltage drop of about 2.0 V .\nThe square waveforms without the overshoots were ob-\nserved for the drain to source voltages V\nQn1, VQn2 of the\ntransistors Qn1, Qn2 and the sinusoidal waveforms overlapped\nwith the triangular waves were measured for the resonant cur-\nrents I\nLrp1, ILrp2. These waveforms mean that the ZVS and the\nZCS were achieved in the LLC resonant circuit topology to\ndecrease the switching loss energies generated from the tran-\nsistors Q\npk, Qnk (k =1, 2).\nThe voltages across the resonant capacitors VCrp1, VCrn1,\nVCrp2, VCrn2 are also shown in Fig. 13. The resonant capac-\nitor voltage consists of the ac ﬂuctuation voltage caused by\nFig. 14. Conversion e ﬃciencies for single cell capaci-\ntively isolated dc–dc converter using (a) body diodes of\nFETs, (b) schottky barrier diodes and (c) FETs for syn-\nchronous rectiﬁcation\nthe conventional resonant circuit operation and the dc biased\nvoltage for the isolation barrier under the ISOP multicell con-\nverter operation. The dc bias of 36 V was seen in V\nCrp1 and\nVCrn2, and the capacitor voltagesVCrp2 and VCrn1 had the aver-\nage value of −12 V . The average dc voltages for the resonant\ncapacitors had good agreement with the analysis in the previ-\nous chapter.\nIn Fig. 13, a pair of capacitor voltages V\nCrp1 and VCrn2 had\nsome errors although the capacitor voltages VCrp1 was ide-\nally coincident with VCrn2. A pair of VCrp2 and VCrn1 also had\nsome errors. These errors were caused by the variation of the\ninductances and the capacitances in the commercially avail-\nable passive components.\nFigure 14 shows the conversion e ﬃciencies of the single\ncell converter with the capacitive isolation. The rated output\npower of the single cell converter was 100 W from Table 2.\nThe eﬃciency of the cell converter using the body diodes of\nFETs (EPC2016 from EPC) in the experiment were shown\nin the blue solid line. The e ﬃciency at the output power of\n100 W was 83.2% and this e ﬃciency approximately corre-\nsponded to the waveforms in Fig. 13 (83.3% =20 V/24 V).\nThe conduction loss caused by the body diodes were domi-\nnant.\nThe utilization of the low voltage Silicon (Si) schottky bar-\nrier diodes (SBDs) is one of options to improve the eﬃciency.\nIn Fig. 14, the measurement result of the e ﬃciency for the\nsingle cell converter was shown in the red solid line, in case\nthat the SBDs (MBRB2060 from ON Semiconductor) substi-\ntuted for the above body diodes. The conversion e ﬃciency\nwas improved from 83.2% to 92.6% at the output power of\n100 W because of the lower forward voltage drop of the rec-\ntiﬁer at the secondary side. The red dashed line in Fig. 14\nmeans the calculation result of the conversion e ﬃciency in\nthe case of SBDs. The conduction loss, the switching loss\ngenerated from the semiconductor power devices, the copper\nloss, the core loss from the inductors were estimated inde-\npendently\n(21) (22) (27). The calculation result had good agreement\nwith the experimental result. The loss analysis based on this\ncalculation is available for estimating the eﬃciency of the cell\nconverter using FETs for the synchronous rectiﬁcation.\nThe green dashed line in Fig. 14 means the estimated con-\nversion eﬃciency of the cell converter in case that the FETs\n275 IEEJ Journal IA, Vol.6, No.4, 2017\nCapacitively isolated multicell dc–dc transformerʢYusuke Hayashi et al.ʣ\n(EPC2001 from EPC) were utilized for the synchronous rec-\ntiﬁcation. Because of the low on–resistances of FETs, the\nreduced conduction loss generated from the rectiﬁer con-\ntributed to improving the e ﬃciency. This calculation result\nmeans that the fabricated cell converter in the experiment has\nthe potential to achieve the e ﬃciency over 96% by the syn-\nchronous rectiﬁcation.\n6. Conclusions\nThe multicell dc–dc transformer using capacitively iso-\nlated cell converters was proposed. The impact of the pro-\nposed topology on improving the conversion e ﬃciency and\nthe power density was discussed quantitatively. The analysis\nfor the voltage–sharing by the resonant capacitors to isolate\nthe total input voltage of the multicell dcx was carried out\nto design the resonant capacitors in each cell converter. The\nﬁrst laboratory prototype of the 96 V–24 V , 200 W multicell\ndcx using two 48 V–24 V , 100 W capacitively isolated dc–dc\ncell converters was fabricated, and the validity of the analysis\nwas veriﬁed. The experimental result also showed the poten-\ntial to achieve higher eﬃciency, taking the loss analysis into\naccount. The highly eﬃcient and the high power density cell\nconverter will be developed in the future work. The proposed\napproach contributes to the development of highly e ﬃcient\nand scalable power converters to realize future low–carbon\nsocieties.\nReferences\n( 1 ) R.R. Schmidt, C. Belady, A.
