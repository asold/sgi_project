  "abstract": "Key Clinical Message Large language models have made artificial intelligence readily available to the general public and potentially have a role in healthcare; however, their use in difficult differential diagnosis is still limited, as demonstrated by a case of necrotizing otitis externa. Abstract This case report presents a peculiar case of necrotizing otitis externa (NOE) with skull base involvement which proved diagnostically challenging. The initial patient presentation and the imaging performed on the 78‐year‐old patient suggested a neoplastic rhinopharyngeal lesion and only after several unsuccessful biopsies the patient was transferred to our unit. Upon re‐evaluation of the clinical picture, a clinical hypothesis of NOE with skull base erosion was made and confirmed by identifying Pseudomonas aeruginosa in biopsy specimens of skull base bone and external auditory canal skin. Upon diagnosis confirmation, the patient was treated with culture‐oriented long‐term antibiotics with complete resolution of the disease. Given the complex clinical presentation, we chose to submit a posteriori this NOE case to two large language models (LLM) to test their ability to handle difficult differential diagnoses. LLMs are easily approachable artificial intelligence tools that enable human‐like interaction with the user relying upon large information databases for analyzing queries. The LLMs of choice were ChatGPT‐3 and ChatGPT‐4 and they were requested to analyze the case being provided with only objective clinical and imaging data.",
