  "abstract": "The problematic use of social media has numerous negative impacts on individuals' daily lives, interpersonal relationships, physical and mental health, and more. Currently, there are few methods and tools to alleviate problematic social media, and their potential is yet to be fully realized. Emerging large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly popular for providing information and assistance to people and are being applied in many aspects of life. In mitigating problematic social media use, LLMs such as ChatGPT can play a positive role by serving as conversational partners and outlets for users, providing personalized information and resources, monitoring and intervening in problematic social media use, and more. In this process, we should recognize both the enormous potential and endless possibilities of LLMs such as ChatGPT, leveraging their advantages to better address problematic social media use, while also acknowledging the limitations and potential pitfalls of ChatGPT technology, such as errors, limitations in issue resolution, privacy and security concerns, and potential overreliance. When we leverage the advantages of LLMs to address issues in social media usage, we must adopt a cautious and ethical approach, being vigilant of the potential adverse effects that LLMs may have in addressing problematic social media use to better harness technology to serve individuals and society.",
