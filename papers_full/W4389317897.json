Previous studies have \ndemonstrated the use of infrastructure-based detector data and UAV video to predict a crash in the near future. The main limitation \nof such data is limited coverage. In this work, we have used connected vehicle trajectory data that can have wide coverage as well \nas provide insight into the trajectory that might lead to a crash. The trajectory data was provided by Wejo which collects data from \nthe manufacturer and was spaced at 3 seconds. GPS locations and their associated time series features such as speed, accelera tion \nand yaw rate were used to feed into an ensembled Transformer and Conformer model. A voting classifier was used to obt ain the \noutput of the final model which achieved a recall of 76% and the false alarm rate of 30%. This study showed how connected \nvehicle trajectory data can aid in getting insight into crashes. While most previous studies focus on using aggregated data t o \nestimate crashes, the proposed work shows that trajectory data mining can also provide competitive results. \n \nIndex Terms—Transformer, Conformer, Connected Vehicle, Crash Prediction, Traffic Safety. \n \nI. INTRODUCTION \nRAFFIC injuries and fatalities result in considerable loss \nto the economy of an individual, their family and to a \ncountry. NHTSA projects that the number of crashes in 2022 \nwill increase by 10% to 42,915 compared to that in 2020  [1] \nalthough most countries are aiming at vision zero action plan \nby 2030 to 2040. Thus, the need for mitigating crashes is \nendless to achieve zero fatalities within a couple of decades. \nA key component in this regard is the prediction of potential \ncrashes. Since crash like situations develop within short -term \nturbulence of traffic flow [2] it is necessary to have real -time \ncrash likelihood monitoring systems. While several \nresearchers have actively worked on this arena, the ever -\nchanging field of sensing technology means there are new \nways of formulating the definition of real -time crash \nlikelihood prediction. Most of the previous studies rely on \ninfrastructure-based data such as loop and radar detectors, \nBluetooth, drone, etc. Nowadays, geolocation data from car \nmanufacturers are available in near real-time. Such data is able \nto provide granular information about each individual vehicle \nand as such, it will eventually be possible to identify or \nclassify driving actions that can lead to a crash. Moreover, \nextended trajectory provides better insights about individual \ndriver’s driving patterns whether near a crash location or not. \nIn this study, we have used individual vehicle data and the \ntrajectory associated with it, to correlate it to crashes. \nAlthough some studies have been aimed at taxi and bus \ntrajectory data, previous studies have always used some form \nof aggregation on it. For example, instead of using time series \ntrajectory data, hard brakes or long stop events were used. \nThus, trajectory data mining in crash likelihood prediction is \na relatively new area of research that has been explored in this \nstudy. The paper is organized as follows: literature review, \ndata preparation, methodology, results, and conclusion. \n \nII. LITERATURE REVIEW \nA. Models in Crash Likelihood Prediction \nCrash prediction has been studied by various researchers \nusing aggregated data. Speed, volume, and its statistical \nfeatures such as average, coefficient of variation, logarithm, \netc. were used in all previous studies. The data is usually \ncollected from roa dside stationary sensors such as radar \ndetections, microwave detectors, Bluetooth, etc. Therefore, \nthe analysis is related to the spot speed rather than the actual \nspeed at a crash location. It was reported that upstream and \ndownstream detectors from a crash location can indicate speed \nand volume features that could lead to a crash [3]. Initially, \ncase control logistic regression was studied [4] which was \nimproved upon with log -linear and Bayesian logistic models \n[5-7]. Bayesian logistic regression model was used by Xu, et \nal. [8]  using four different congestion levels as dependent \nvariable. Nevertheless, statistical approaches often come with \nsignificant assumptions related to data distribution and \npreparation [9-14]. These prerequisites can often impair the \naccuracy of crash likelihood predictions.

Thus far, s upport Vector Machine (SVM) \n[15, 16] , Long Short -Term Memory (LSTM) [17, 18] , \nRandom Forest [19] have been used to predict crashes. Huang, \net al. [20]  used Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to \npredict crashes in Interstates and found better results than \nshallow models. Bao, et al. [21]  also used CNN to model \ncitywide short-term crash likelihood prediction and reported \nthat CNN was able to capture local spatial correlation. \nXGBoost [22], AdaBoost [23], Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) \n[24-26], Back Propagation Neural Net (BPNN) [27] have also \nbeen studied with competitive accuracy scores. Moreover, \nsignal information was also used to predict crashes at \nintersections [28]. To add a further dimension to the crash \nprediction arena, Islam, et al. [29]  used variational \nautoencoder to balance crash samples before training since \nmost previous studies have used matched case control models \nwhere a lot of the non -crash events need to be removed. \nLately, transformer [30] and its variant, the conformer [31], \nhave received significant attention among researchers because \nof their aptitude to capture context and dependencies in \nsequential data. So far, Transformer and Conformer have \nportrayed application prominence in several research domains \nsuch as natural la nguage processing [32], computer vision, \nspeech detection [31], time-series analysis [33], etc. However, \ndespite their enormous contributions, to the best of the authors \nknowledge, no studies investigated the application of \nTransformer and Conformer in real-time crash.  \nB. Data in Crash Likelihood Prediction \nThe data used in almost all studies is limited to roadside \nstationary sensors like detectors, signal controller, etc. Some \nresearch also takes into account the weather from nearby \nweather stations. The main limitation of such sensing is that it \ncan only pr ovide traffic features for a segment of the road. \nOften road segments can be a mile long in length and the data \nreported by roadside sensors cannot consider the various \ntraffic parameter distribution within the segment length. The \nsegments on the road that do not have a detector can often be \na blind zone for the different machine learning models. On the \nother hand, vehicle -based location data can provide detailed \ndata based on the frequency. This enables a system to reduce \nthe so -called blind zones created by roadside sensors. \nMoreover, roadside sensing needs regular maintenance and as \nsuch the data availability is also hampered. Geolocation data \nfrom connected vehicles does not have a single point of failure \nthat can lead to missing data. A segment of road will be \ntraversed by multiple vehicles thereby sampled by different \nsensors [34]. Such data has been used in some previous studies \nto estimate queue length [35], lane changing behavior [36], \nstop-or-go decision [37], etc. Most studies are limited to using \ntaxi data or large -scale bus data that cannot form a \nrepresentative sample. Furthermore, taxis would exhibit \ncertain pickup and drop -off patterns while buses can only \ntravel fixed routes. The data used in this paper was provided \nby Wejo Data Services, Inc. which collects data from \nautomotive OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers). \nThus, it represents mostly non -commercial vehicles. The \ndataset contains trajectory data with an update interval of \nabout 3 seconds. It c overs four counties in Orlando, Florida: \nOrange, Seminole, Volusia and Osceola. The penetration rate \nwas around 3%. Previous studies reported that penetration rate \nof 0.8% could provide an acceptable representation of traffic \nflow [38]. \nVehicle based data have been used in the past studies to \nidentify critical driving events like speeding, hard brakes, jerk, \netc., which were found to be positively correlated to accidents \n[39]. The driving patterns of several drivers were found to be \nan indicator for potential crashes [40]. Only 167 drivers were \nused in a 14 -month period making the penetration rate very \nlow. Taxi geolocation data was used by Xie, et al. [41] to study \ncorridor intersection safety. Smartphone data was also used by \nsome researchers to model crash frequency [42]. It was also \nnoted in this study that hard brakes, congestion level, and \nspeed variance were positively related to crash frequency. \nHard braking events were also found to be correlated to \ncrashes at work zone [43]. Bus GPS data was also used to \nidentify real-time crash potential on arterials [17]. It can be \nnoted in all these studies that researchers are more focused on \nusing events to model crashes. GPS data has been used to \ncalculate hazardous events like hard brake, jerk, etc. Thus, the \nfull potential of connected vehicle trajectory data is sti ll \nunexplored. \nA summary  of  reviewed literatures on crash likelihood \nprediction are listed in Table I, with details on best performing \nmodels and data sources. \nC. Crash Likelihood with UAV Data \nA comparable alternative to using connected vehicle \ntrajectory data to predict crash likelihood is video -based \nvehicle trajectory data collected from unmanned aerial vehicle \n(UAV) video. UAVs typically record traffic video from the \n“bird’s-eye” perspective with high-resolution cameras, \nensuring high-quality vehicle trajectory data at the frame level \n[44]. Several studies have  attempted to extract vehicle \ntrajectories from UAV videos in order to identify crash \npotential in moving traffic [45-48]. The studies demonstrated \nthat UAV recorded traffic videos have enormous potential for \nreliable crash likelihood prediction. Nonetheless, the same \nstudies revealed several severe drawbacks to relying solely on \nUAV recordings for crash likelihood prediction. To begin, it \nis challenging to anticipate crash potential in real time using \nUAV video-based trajectory data. For instance, UAVs require \na constant supply of power to function properly.  Hence, any \ndisruption in the  power supply can cause UAVs to \nmalfunction, ultimately  delaying the real -time crash \nlikelihood prediction work. Moreover, extreme weather can \nimpair UAV real -time operation [49]. Secondly, UAVs can \nonly capture short vehicle trajectories in space for a brief road \nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Open Journal of Intelligent Transportation Systems.

So, if the goal is to estimate crash likelihood in real-\ntime at the network level, UAVs have a significant \ndisadvantage. While platooning many UAVs side by side \nalong the road network can solve this problem, the installation \nand operation costs may skyrocket. In response to the \nshortcomings of UAVs, connected vehicles have reliable \npower supply systems and can operate in inclement weather. \nFurthermore, connected vehicles can generate extended \ntrajectories suited for network -level crash likelihood \nprediction at no additional cost. Overall, connected vehicle \ntrajectory data has enormous promise for predicting crash \nlikelihood. \nIn this study, we employ  connected vehicle trajectory data \nfrom Wejo  to identify crash potential. As such, rather than \ndepending solely on event data and brief trajectory data, this \nstudy is able to capture long -term vehicle dynamics (such as \nspeed distribu tion, acceleration variation, and so on) that \ncontribute to a crash. The contributions of this paper are \nsummarized below: \n1. Concatenation of state -of-the-art Transformer and \nConformer algorithms to predict crash likelihood in real-\ntime. \n2. Exploration of the aptness of connected vehicle \ntrajectory data from Wejo in crash potential \nidentification. \n \nIII. DATA PREPARATION \nThe dataset used in this paper was provided by Wejo. It \ncontains vehicle specific data from several manufacturers. It \nmainly has non-commercial fleet data which better represents \nthe vehicles on the roadways. Instantaneous data is sent from \nthe vehicle to the cloud (V2C) in near real -time. The dataset \nconsists of GPS location, heading, speed, postal code, \njourneyId and dataPointId. A brief description of the raw data \nfeatures is shown in Table II. The sampling rate of the dataset \nwas limited to 3 seconds. Also, the dataset was limited to four \ncounties in Florida. Within this region there are several \nexpressways such as Interstate-4, Interstate -95, SR  408, SR \n417 and SR  528, along with several arterials. Considering \navailability, data during the following two time periods were \nused in this stud y: 11.11.2019-17.11.2019 and 10.11.2020-\n16.11.2020.  \nThe trajectory data was joined with crash data from Signal \nFour Analytics (S4A). It provides the geolocation as well as \ncrash severity, crash time, etc. Crash data was merged with \nconnected vehicle data considering spatial and temporal \nbuffer. For a particular crash location, the prior  5-minute \ninterval was considered as the influence period and 300 feet \nwas set as the spatial buffer.  To specify further, if any Wejo \nvehicle traversed within a 300-foot radius of a location where \na crash would happen in the f ollowing 0 -5 minutes, it was \nregarded as a representative sample that contributed to the \ncrash. It should be noted that between the two datasets (crash \nand trajectory), it was not possible to identify whether any of \nTABLE I \nSUMMARY OF LITERATURE REVIEW ON CRASH LIKELIHOOD PREDICTION \nReference Publication Year Model (Best) Data Sources \n[4] 2004 Case Control Logistic Regression Detector \n[7] 2015 Bayesian Logistic Regression Detector, Weather \n[8] 2015 Bayesian Random Parameter Logistic Regression Detector, Geometry \n[9] 2017 Support Vector Machine Automatic Vehicle Identification \n[10] 2013 Support Vector Machine Detector \n[12] 2020 LSTM-CNN Adaptive Signal Controller, Detector, Weather \n[13] 2015 Random Forest Archived Data Management System \n[14] 2020 CNN Radar Sensors \n[17] 2019 Support Vector Machine Detector \n[18] 2020 Multilayer Perceptron Simulation \n[19] 2020 Multilayer Perceptron Simulation \n[21] 2019 Back Propagation Neural Net Simulation \n[22] 2018 Bayesian Conditional Logistic Regression Adaptive Signal Controller, Detector, Weather \n[23] 2020 Variational Autoencoder Detector \n \nTABLE II \nFEATURES FROM CONNECTED VEHICLE DATA \nName Description Unit \nFeatures from Raw Data \ndataPointId Unique Id for each Data Point - \njourneyId Unique Id for each journey (ignition start \nto ignition end) - \nlatitude North-South position of the vehicle - \nlongitude East-West position of the vehicle - \nspeed Speed of the vehicle at the instant the \ndatapoint was captured meter/s \nheading Direction of the vehicle at the instant the \ndatapoint was captured degrees \npostalCode Zip code of the GPS location - \nFeatures Computed from Raw Data \nisStopped 1 if speed is less than 5mph, else 0 - \nacceleration \nPositive rate of change of speed between \ntwo successive datapoints meter/s*s \ndeceleration Negative rate of change of speed between \ntwo successive datapoints meter/s*s \nyawRate Rate of change of heading between \nsuccessive datapoints degrees/s \ndayOfWeek Temporal feature representing day of the \nweek - \nhour The hour at the instant GPS point was \ncaptured - \n \nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Open Journal of Intelligent Transportation Systems.

Rather, our \nmethodology aims to obtain the vehicle trajectories and their \nspeed, acceleration profile, etc., to be indicative of the possible \ntraffic features that led to a crash. We would also like to note \nthat as the market penetration increases, it will ultimately be \npossible to do  specific analysis of the vehicle involved in a \ncrash. The overall pipeline is shown in Fig. 1. \n \nFig. 1. Data Processing Pipeline \nTable III shows the statistics after the crash data was joined \nwith Wejo  data. Almost 2 million GPS datapoints were \navailable after screening by time and location of crashes. In \n2019, about 50% of the crash locations had representative \nWejo vehicle data while around 80% for 2020. The max \nnumber of vehicles that passed through a crash location 5 \nminutes prior to a crash was 21 and minimum was 1.  \nThe joining on spatial and temporal buffer was followed by \nwindowing. In this step, the intent was to distinctively \norganize and associate traffic features with crash and non-\ncrash events. To do so, a 30 -second window was selecte d. \nAfterwards, we identified the time when a Wejo vehicle in its \njourney traversed through the crash influence zone, outlined \nby a 5-minute interval and a 300-foot radius. As the time was \nidentified, the trajectory datapoints from the 30 seconds prior \nto that specific moment were attributed to the crash event. For \ninstance, if a crash occurred at 10:50:15, with the crash \ninfluence time interval spanning from 10:45:15 to 10:50:15, \nand a Wejo vehicle drove past the crash spot at 10:48:30, then \nthe vehicle’s trajectory datapoints from 10:48:15 to 10:48:30 \nwere associated with a crash,  labeled as “1.” The remaining \ndatapoints of the Wejo vehicle were labeled as “0” (i.e., non-\ncrash event). Fig. 2 illustrates the trajectory of a Wejo vehicle, \nfrom the start of ignition to the moment of the vehicle traverse \nthrough the crash influence zone . The red star represents the \ncrash location. The green dots on the plot signify data points \nlabeled non-crash, whereas the blue dots highlight the labeled \ncrash.  \nAfter windowing, the trajectory data was then converted \ninto a 2D matrix to extract the nature of the vehicle trajectory. \nThis matrix was generated to obtain the nature of vehicle \ntrajectory (whether straight linear motion or turning motion or \nlane changing motion) in the time window. \n \nFig. 2.

The x -axis \ncontains the order of the datapoints that are separated by 3 \nseconds. The instances from 40 to 50 were labelled as crash \nwhile any prior instance was non -crash. Each journey is \nhighlighted in a different color. It is noted that variation in \nacceleration is  more significant than in other cases of the \njourney. Same can be concluded about the yaw rate. This \nshows that the crash location is experiencing a high number of \nbraking events and unusual swerving movements. The speed \nof most journeys also falls. The he ading also shows notable \nchanges indicating a probable turbulent situation. \n \nIV. METHODOLOGY \nThis study, with the attention-based Transformer [30] and \nits Conformer [31] variant, presents ensemble Transformer-\nConformer algorithm for real-time crash likelihood prediction \nusing connected vehicle trajectory data.  The detailed \narchitecture of the Transformer-Conformer is discussed in this \nsection. Fig. 4 depicts the proposed ensemble structure. Per \nthe structure, both the Transformer and Conformer models \nwere trained separately using the processed trajectory data. \nThe modeling results of the two trained models were then \nconcatenated following the technique of voting classifier [50] \nto finally use it for crash likelihood prediction. Additionally, \nthe proposed algorithm was tested with several deep learning \nalgorithms including  Convolution Neural Network (CNN)  \n[51, 52], Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) [53, 54], Particle \nSwarm Optimization (PSO) LSTM  [55], Attention LSTM -\nCNN [56], and Deep Neural Network (DNN) [57], to conform \nits effectiveness of application. \n \nFig. 4. Transformer-Conformer Model Workflow \nA. Transformer \nOriginally, the Transformer algorithm was designed to \nperform NLP tasks leveraging attention -mechanism [30]. In \nthis study, the functional domain of the original transformer is \nextended to predict crash likelihood in real-time. The model \narchitecture of the Transformer is shown in Fig. 5.  \nUnlike traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and \nlong-short term memory (LSTM) models, Transformer \nstructurally favors an attention -based system by averting \nsequential processing. Hence, to capture the order of each \nsequence/input in the trajectory data, a positional encoding \nblock was embedded in the transformer architecture. The \nnormalized trajectory data with information on the order of the \nsequences were forwarded all at once to the encoder block as \nshown in Fig. 5. The encoder is the core block of the \ntransformer architecture employed in this study. In total, three \nencoder blocks were stacked with a linear layer to make output \npredictions. Inside the encoder block, two key sub -blocks, \nnamely multi-head self-attention, and feed -forward network, \nfunction. The multi-head self-attention executes the attention \nmechanism of the Transformer by concatenating the attention \nweights of n single-heads. Each single -head takes 3 inputs, \nnamely query 𝑄, key 𝐾, and value 𝑉, in total to calculate the \n \nFig. 3.

The Q, 𝐾, and 𝑉 \nvectors for each sequence are obtained through \ntransformation. Fig. 5 also depicts how the multi -head \nattention sub -block functions. The attention mechanism of \nmulti-head attention sub -block can be mathematically \nrepresented as follows: \n𝐴𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛(𝑄, 𝐾, 𝑉) = 𝑠𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥 (𝑄𝐾𝑇\n√𝑑𝑘\n) 𝑉 (1) \nwhere 𝑄, 𝐾, and 𝑉 are query, key, and value, vectors, \nrespectively. 𝑇 represents transpose, and dk is the dimension \nof the key vector. The feed-forward network in Fig. 5 enables \nthe model with the capacity to model more complex \nrelationships by altering the representation obtained from the \nmulti-head attention sub -block. In this study, CNN with \nconvolution of kernel size 1 was incorporated as the feed -\nforward network. Also, in the encoder, each of the key \ncomponents are followed by dropout, residual connection, and \nlayer normalization, to prevent the model from overfitting, \ncombat the problem of vanishi ng gradients, and keep the \nactivations and gradients on a similar scale, respectively. \nB. Conformer \nConformer combines the strengths of convolutional neural \nnetworks (CNNs) and transformers. This combination allows \nthe model to capture both local and global dependencies in the \ninput data. The model architecture of the Conformer is shown \nin Fig. 6 (a). Th ere were four conformer blocks stacked with \na linear layer to make output predictions. A Conformer block \nis shown in Fig. 6 (b). The three main sub -blocks are a feed -\nforward module, a multi -head self -attention module and a \nconvolution module. Due to these three sub -blocks, a \nConformer is able to extract global and local features more \neffectively. A feed forward module, as shown in Fig. 6 (c), is \nstacked on a multi -head attention module followed by a \nconvolution module. This is preceded by another feed-forward \nmodule. The feed -forward module consists of a layer \nnormalization, linear layer and Swish activation function [58]. \nSome dropout layers and a linear layer follows. The first linear \nlayer expands the input dimension four -fold and the last one \nbrings it back to the original dimension. The multi -head \nattention module is visualized in Fig. 6 (d). It features Layer \nNormalization, multi-head attention with relation positioning \nembedding and a Dropout layer. Lastly, the convolution \nmodule in Fig. 6 (e) consists of Layer Normalization with \npointwise Convolution and gated linear unit (GLU)  \nActivation; one of the layers expands the dimension by 0.5 \nwhile the other doubles it. It is followed by a 1D depth \nconvolution, batch normalization, Swish Activation and \nPointwise convolution. \nTherefore, the relationship between the input and output \ncan be modelled as: \n𝑋 = 𝑋 + 1\n2 𝐹𝐹𝑁(𝑋) (2) \n𝑋 = 𝑋 + 𝑀𝐻𝑆𝐴(𝑋) (3) \n𝑋 = 𝑋 + 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑣(𝑋) (4) \n𝐴𝑌 = 𝐿𝑎𝑦𝑒𝑟𝑁𝑜𝑟𝑚 (𝑋 +\n1\n2 𝐹𝐹𝑁(𝑋)) (5) \nwhere 𝐹𝐹𝑁(), 𝑀𝐻𝑆𝐴(), 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑣(), and 𝐿𝑎𝑦𝑒𝑟𝑁𝑜𝑟𝑚() \ndenote feed -forward module, multi -head self -attention, \nconvolution module and layer-normalization respectively. \n \n \nFig. 5.

RESULTS \nThe processed data set had 196,905 samples in total. Out of \nthese total samples 7180 were related to a crash and were \nlabeled as one while the others were related to non -crash. \nSince this is an extremely imbalanced data set, Synthetic \nMinority Oversampling  Technique (SMOTE) was used to \nupsample the minority class. This has been used widely and \nhas been accepted as an effective method for oversampling \ncrashes [18, 59, 60]. The data set was split into an 80:20 ratio \nfor training and testing purposes. It should be noted that only \nthe train samples were oversampled and the performance of \nthe model on the test data is reported. This ensures that the \nmodel is evaluated on real data and not synthetic data.  \nA critical aspect of ensuring dependable outcomes from \nmodel training is the fine -tuning of hyperparameters and the \nselection of suitable optimization functions. In this research,  \nbefore the actual training, both the Transformer and \nConformer models were fine -tuned using a variety of \nhyperparameters and optimization functions. Table IV depicts \nthe optimal parameter sets for the trained Transformer and \nConformer models.  After identifying the parameters, the \nmodels were trained accordingly and subsequently ensembled \nto finally assess its effectiveness on the test data. \nFor evaluating the model performance on the test dataset, \nseveral key metrics were used such as accuracy, recall, and \nfalse positive rate. The performance metrics are reported for \nthe test data. While accuracy is usually studied for balanced \ndatasets, parameters such as recall, false alarm rate, etc., a re \nwidely used to measure model performance for imbalanced \ndatasets. Recall indicates what percentage of correct positive \npredictions are made [61, 62] , while the false positive rate \nindicates how often the model is likely miss-predict.  \n \n \nFig. 6.

The ensemble \nmodel generated a recall of 76% and a false alarm rate of 30%. \nThe confusion matrix is based on the test data shown in Table \nV. It can be seen that out of the 1365 crashes in the test data, \n1042 were correctly classified. Almost 11,600 samples were \nalso classified as true which is the false alarm of the model. \nWhile this performance is lowe r than the traditional studies \nwith detector data, it should be noted that the penetration rate \nof the CV vehicles used in this study was very low: about 3%. \nIt is interesting to formulate the notion that only a percentage \nof the vehicles in the road can f orm a trajectory data pattern \nthat can be indicative of a crash even though it may or may \nnot directly participate in the crash. \nA. Model Comparison \nTo perform a complete evaluation of the proposed model, \nthe Transformer -Conformer model was compared with six \ndifferent benchmark models. The results of the different \nmodels and associated performance metrics on test dataset are \nshown in Table V I. Compared to the benchmark models, the \nTransformer-Conformer model gives the best accuracy. While \nthe recall is higher for most other models, it comes at the \nexpense of high false alarms. The CNN and LSTM models \nindividually perform much worse than the co mbined model. \nThe performance of the DNN model is slightly better than the \nCNN or LSTM model with lower false alarm rate. The closest \ncompetitors to the Transformer -Conformer model are \nTransformer, Conformer, Attention LSTM -CNN, and PSO -\nLSTM. Nevertheless, they also performed poorly compared to \nthe performance of Transformer-Conformer. \n \nVI. CONCLUSION \nIn this paper the authors proposed the use of novel \nconnected vehicle trajectory data in order to predict crash \nevents in real time. An ensemble crash likelihood prediction \nmodel was built based on the trajectory data using \nTransformer and Conformer algorithms. To do so, both the \nTransformer and Conformer models were trained individually \non the processed trajectory data before finally concatenating \nthem using voti ng classifier technique. The proposed model \nachieved a recall of 76% with a false alarm rate of  30% \nshowing that the model performs reasonably well given that \nthe data set only represents 3% of the vehicles on the road. \nThe crash likelihood prediction model developed in this \nstudy offers wide-ranging applications in the real -world. \nThese models are instrumental in improving Advanced Driver \nAssistance Systems (ADAS) that alert drivers of potential \ncrashes and can even autonomously brake the vehicle. This \ntechnology is also crucial for the development of autonomous \nvehicles, ensuring they navigate safely. On a broader scale, \nTraffic Management Centers can use these models to optimize \ntraffic flows in urban  areas, identifying  high-risk zones and \nmanaging congestion. Mobile apps can be devised to notify \ndrivers about these zones, and insurance companies can \nrecalibrate premiums based on the derived data. Additionally, \ncity authorities can make infrastructural adjustments in areas \nidentified as crash hotspots . However, to maximize its real -\nworld efficacy, further refinements are imperative in areas like \ndata privacy, data reliability, data accessibility, vehicle \ncompatibility, infrastructure readiness, etc. \nIn essence, this research effectively formulated a crash \nprediction model aimed at advancing real -time traffic safety. \nHowever, several aspects warrant further exploration. To \nbegin with, the data used to construct the prediction model had \na relatively modest penetration rate of 3%. It would be \nbeneficial for subsequent studies to incorporate data with a \nhigher penetration and possibly delve into vehicle-level crash \npredictions. Furthermore, feature importance of the variables \ncould be explored using SHAP or LIME to find compounding \nvariables that result in a crash.  Another assumption was that \nvehicles near a crash site implicitly indicated a collision. It’s \nvital for subsequent studies to determine which connected \nvehicles, if any, were directly involved in the incident. \nAdditionally, while this study offers a crash prediction tool, it \ndoesn’t delve into the statistical correlations between \nidentified factors and the likelihood of a crash. Future \nendeavors should address the magnitude and significance of \nthese relations. Finally, while making crash predictions, the \nstudy didn’t account for crash types, despite the evident link \nbetween crash typ es and the way crash occurs . It would be \nadvantageous for future research to consider crash types while \nmaking predictions. \n \nTABLE V \nCONFUSION MATRIX \n \nPredicted \nNon-Crash Crash \nActual Non-Crash 26395 11581 \nCrash 323 1042 \n \n \nTABLE VI \nMODEL COMPARISON \nModel Recall False Alarm Rate \nTransformer-Conformer (Proposed) 0.76 0.30 \nTransformer 0.74 0.36 \nConformer 0.70 0.34 \nAttention LSTM-CNN 0.70 0.34 \nPSO-LSTM 0.66 0.47 \nLSTM 0.92 0.77 \nCNN 0.93 0.73 \nDNN 0.91 0.71 \n \n \nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Open Journal of Intelligent Transportation Systems.
