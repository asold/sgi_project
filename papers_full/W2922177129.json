  "abstract": "After the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant accident, some airborne and ground radiation measurement techniques have been applied to the environmental radiation measurements.These methods have been used in different situations depending on the spatial distribution of air dose rate in the environment.In our previous studies, the most effective tool was selected in response to the feature of targeted environment.However, airborne and ground radiation measurement results have not yet been evaluated and compared in the same environment.In this study, we attempted to quantitatively evaluate the results of airborne and ground radiation measurements with the parameter of normalized mean square error in the same farm.Consequently, the reliability of each measurement technique was quantified.The comparison of different techniques, which is important to effectively monitor the spatial distribution of air dose rate in the environment, could be achieved using this method.",
