  "abstract": "With the continuous development of electronic warfare technologies, there is an increasing demand for efficient and intelligent training systems. Large Language Models (LLMs), as a significant breakthrough in artificial intelligence in recent years, demonstrate broad application potential in electronic warfare training due to their capabilities in natural language processing, decision support, and data generation. This paper first introduces the basic principles and working mechanisms of LLMs, then analyzes the needs and challenges in electronic warfare training. It further explores the specific applications of LLMs in electronic warfare training, including the generation of simulated combat scenarios, electronic warfare strategy simulation, and the advantages and limitations of the model in training. Through comparative analysis, this paper summarizes the practical effects of LLMs in electronic warfare training and discusses the challenges and areas for improvement in their application. Finally, the paper looks ahead to the future development of LLMs in this field and provides related research suggestions.",
