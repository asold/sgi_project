Studies described that the noise of the \ntransformer mainly derives from electromagnetic vibration \nbehavior as well as the core and winding vibrating [1]. The \nelectromagnetic vibration of the core and electrodynamics \nforce of the coil is partially assigned to reluctance magnetic \nforces and Lorentz, respectively [2]-[4].

An adequate \nknowledge of the noise generation mechanism of  \nthe transformer and a precise valuation of its emission \nproperties remains important. Reference [5] has shown that \nmagnetostriction in oriented electrical steel is the main cause of \nvibration and noise in electric apparatus. The valuable of \nmagnetostriction was principally caused by the enormous range \nof magnetic moment. Reference [6] offered a new method for \nevaluating the power transformer, which analyzes the \nfundamental frequency elements of the vibrating signals of the \ncore in rated settings. Transformer noise is caused by a \nphenomenon that causes a part of a magnetic sheet to extend \nitself when magnetized. Commonly stated, there are two \nexplanations for the noise of the core: 1) magnetostrictive force \nof the silicon steel sheet and 2) vibration of the core [7]-[9]. \nCorrect analysis of the entire vibration of the core is one of the \nmain difficulties in the research of transformer’s noise. The \nmagnetic structure connection system has frequently been \nutilized to determine and diagnose core vibrating problems [10], \n[11], [12]. When the magnetization has been taken away, it \ngoes back to its original condition. \nNoise calculations of many amorphous magnetic materials \nsuch as Fe-Si-B, Ni-Fe-B and Co-Fe-Si-B, seek the adjustment \nto obtain the lowest noise performance. The noise of the \nmagnetic cores is well-detailed as the oscillation of the \nconverted voltage waveform of the magnetic cores in each \ncycle of the stimulating irregular magnetic field. The opened \ncore type fluxgate magnetometer is approved as a noise testing \nequipment, which allows fast and simple noise analysis because \nwinding is not required on each sample. Vibration noise was \nexamined in relation to alloy compositions, Curie temperature, \nand magnetic domain patterns. The relation connecting the \nvibratory acceleration of the core and the magnetostriction \nimpact was studied, and it is deduced that the acceleration or \nthe vibratory amplitude of the core is rectilinear to the square of \nthe voltage magnitude and the factor of magnetostriction [13], \n[14]. Later in [15], an operative technique to reduce acoustic \nradiation has been suggested by connecting a microperforated \npanel (MPP) in the internal part of the oil-immersed \ntransformer. The vibration noise from different core structures \nwas also studied in the literature [16], and the results indicate \nthat the toroidal core design offers less vibration noise than the \nC-type core having rectangular and arc corners. There is no \nstudy fashionable which the fastening pressure was directly \nInvestigation on Vibration Characteristics of \nAmorphous Metal Alloy Core Dry-type \nDistribution Transformer \nKammeugue Noubissi Romaric, Daosheng Liu, Member, IEEE, and Boxue Du, Senior Member, IEE \nT\nKAMMEUGUE et al.: INVESTIGATION ON VIBRATION CHARACTERISTICS OF AMORPHOUS METAL ALLOY CORE DRY-TYPE  \nDISTRIBUTION TRANSFORMER \n325\ncorrelated to acoustic sound, and the ideal pressure on an \namorphous metal distribution transformer still requires being \nfurther explored [17].  \nThis work focuses to launch analytical models, analyze the \nvibrating of the core and transformer coils, the magnetostriction, \nLorentz, and then the magnetic reticence dynamics that aided as \nexcitation. To obtain the main excitations of the harmonic \ncomponent, the Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) is carried \nout on the transient strength and magnetostriction. The \nvibrating distributions of the transformer brackets were \ncomputed by harmonic response analysis. The structure surface \ndistributions were then obtained to present like border settings \nin the sound field investigation, and the vibration distribution is \nfound. The representational (3-D) Finite Element design for \nElectromagnetic Simulation (EMS), Mechanical System \nAnalyses (Modal, structural static, Harmonic Response \nAnalysis) are built in SolidWorks and solved in ANSYS \nMAXWELL that is coupled with Workbench. Conferring to the \nresults of the analysis, the vibration reduction method was \nproposed by adding reinforcing bars on the upper clamp of \nAMACDT to suppress the magnitude at the position of \nmaximum vibration. \nII.

Electromagnetic Simulation \nThe geometry of an SCBH15-200/10 distribution \ntransformer is shown in Fig. 3(a) and its core is composed of \namorphous ribbon. \nTo determine the magnetic flux density of core at rated \noperation state that is 1.228T for Amorphous Metal Alloy core \ndistribution transformer, a source of 400 V was connected \nthrough a voltage regulator to the secondary windings of an \nAMACDT where the current flows when the primary side is \nopened-circuit, the winding coupled with the cores, create some \nforces such as Lorentz forces, and the magnetostriction which \nis the main source of the vibration noise, the cores linked to the \nbracket through the insulation board, transfer the vibration \nenergy to the bracket. Moreover, the Fig4 a, and b are the modal \nanalysis simulation which can also indicate on how the bracket \nis excited. During the no-load condition, the greater the \nmagnetic flux density is, the higher the core’s vibration \nmagnitude will be. Electromagnetic analysis of AMACDT core \nis represented in Fig. 3(b). \nAccording to Fig. 3(b), maximal magnetic flux density of the \nthree-phase core is 1.3928 T, which has evenly distributed on \nthe four inner chamfers of the inner edge of each core. The \nminimum magnetic flux density is 0.01 T, which has evenly \ndistributed at the four outer bottom chamfers of the yoke and \nthe outer edge of the small core on the left and right sides, the \nmagnetic flux density distribution of the outer-small core \ncolumn is relatively uniform and its value is 1.2545 T. Core \n\nKAMMEUGUE et al.: INVESTIGATION ON VIBRATION CHARACTERISTICS OF AMORPHOUS METAL ALLOY CORE DRY-TYPE  \nDISTRIBUTION TRANSFORMER \n327\nmagnetostriction is the main factor in causing the transformer \nto vibrate [19], [20]. Hence, the vibration of the position where \nthe intensity of the magnetic induction is large also increases \ncorrespondingly. \n \nFig. 3.  Electromagnetic analysis. (a)  Geometry of distribution transformer, (b) \nThree-phase core magnetic flux density distribution.  \nB. Modal Analysis Vibration of AMACDT  \nHowever, resonance in the transformer core may be induced \nby increasing vibration and noise [21], [22]. Thus, resonance \nmight appear at these harmonic frequencies. To prevent \nimprovement of vibration caused by the phenomenon of \nresonance, the modification of natural frequency and excitation \nprevention of the core with the similar frequency while \nmanufacturing the model of the core are necessary. As well, \nsuitable modifications to the cross-sectional distance and the \nweightiness of the AMACDT core might also be favorable to \nreduce the vibration acoustic of the transformer [23]. The main \norigin of vibration is the magnetostrictive strain, so the most \nimportant frequency is 100 Hz. \nFig. 4 presents  the results of the modal analysis. The \ncalculated natural frequencies in Fig. 4(a), and (b) show that the \nmode vibration at 62 Hz and 108.21 Hz are natural frequencies. \nThe maximal deformations are 1.472, 2.165 mm respectively, \nand they are observed in Fig. 4(a) that at 62 Hz, the vibration \ntrend is on the upper clamp of AMACDT that oscillates from \ntop to bottom view. Fig. 4(b) shows the mode vibration at \n108.21 Hz, and its maximum is shown on the top of the left and \nright-side brackets which swings relatively from side to middle \nof AMACDT to opposite direction. \nThe upper clamp is the major vibration part according to the \nmodal analysis with a fixed support at the bottom, and the mode \nvibration at 62 Hz, 108.21 Hz are near to the power frequency \nand the multiple of the frequency respectively, and on those \nfrequencies, the resonances present slighter damage. \nThe vibrating mode is higher on the upper clamp. Therefore, \nit is essential to investigate the vibratory characteristics on the \ntop clamp of the AMACDT. \n \nFig. 4.  Simulated results of the modal analysis. (a) Transformer analysis at 62 \nHz, (b) Transformer analysis at 108.21 Hz. \nC. Harmonic Response Analysis \nWith the outcomes of the Electromagnetic (magnetostriction, \nLorentz forces), structural static, the vibration modal analysis, \nthe mechanical displacement is gauged through harmonic \nresponse analysis. The explained and globalized equation of \nsignal is specified in (1). \nFig. 5 shows the vibration displacements of the transformer at \ndiverse frequencies. It is shown in Fig. 5(a), and (b) that the \nmaximum vibration displacements are on the upper clamp of \nthe transformer at 63.85 and 77.71 Hz, and their values are \n0.00044 and 0.00055mm respectively. It also shows that the \nmaximum vibration on the winding is 0.0003 mm on the low \nvoltage winding at phase B.  \nIn Fig. 5(c), the maximum displacement is on the upper \nclamp of the AMACDT with a value of 0.00058 mm at 91.57 \nHz, and the deformation on the winding is at phase B low \nvoltage winding with a value of 0.00032 mm. In Fig. 5(d), the \nmaximum vibration displacement is on the left winding (phase \nC) with a value of 0.0024 mm at 105.43 Hz, and the maximum \ndeformation on the top clamp of the transformer is 0.00135 \nmm. \nFig. 6 shows that the vibration displacement becomes \nexponential after 119.29 Hz, and it increases gradually with the \nfrequency. The vibration displacement is relational to the \nfrequency. The higher the frequency is, the larger the vibration \ndisplacement is. \n328 CES TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL MACHINES AND SYSTEMS, VOL. 6, NO. 3, SEPTEMBER 2022 \n \n \nFig. 5.  Vibration displacements of AMACDT by harmonic response analysis. \n(a) Displacement at 63.857 Hz, (b) Displacement at 77.714 Hz, (c) \nDisplacement at 91.571 Hz, (d) Displacement at 105.43 H z. \nThe fundamental frequency of the AMACDT vibrating \nmotion is twice the nominal frequency. The AMACDT is easily \nexcited to resonate around 105 Hz from the harmonic response  \n \nFig. 6.  Relation between the displacement and frequency of AMACDT. \nanalysis, so that the vibration amplitude at 105 Hz is larger. 105 \nHz represents the vibrating periodic of the AMACDT which is \nnear to the natural frequency 100 Hz. \nAnalytically in ANSYS software, to extract the amplitude of \nthe vibration displacement after a complete simulation, only the \nupper bracket was selected, analyzed and plot as we can \nobserve the result in Fig 7 (b). \nFig. 7(a) and (b) present the results of the vibration \ndisplacement on the windings and on the upper clamp of the \nAMACDT respectively. Those representations illustrate the \nrange of x, y, and z-element of the displacement. The results of \nthe modal analysis have demonstrated that one of the resonance \nfrequencies of the dynamic part and the bracket are near the \ndouble of the excitation frequency. \nIn Fig. 7(a) and (b), we observe that the vibration \ndisplacement is the larger at 105.43 Hz and the magnitude for \nthe component ‘z’ is the larger one with a value of 0.0013 and \n0.0011 mm, respectively. \nAt this frequency, the vibration amplitude of the upper clamp \nincreased then decreased. The largest vibration displacement at \n105.43 Hz signifies that the AMACDT resonates under the \neffect of the novel approach (bar-reinforcement) which causes \nthe higher amplitude at this frequency more obviously than \nother frequencies. \nIV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS \nA. Relationship Combining Amplitude and Frequency at \nDiverse Phase Under No-load State \nFig. 8 illustrates the rapport connecting the vibration \namplitude and frequency in phases A, B, and C when the \nopened-circuit voltage was connected at the nominal rate on the \nAMACDT. When the applied voltages are the same, the \nfundamental frequency is twice higher than the power frequen \ncy, and its vibration periodic is 100 Hz. The magnitude of the \nvibration on phase B at 300 Hz is the largest one with an \namplitude of 6.1151 mV. It is clarified that the high-frequency \ncomponent for the vibration is produced by the forces of \nmagnetostriction of the cores. The magnitude of the vibration \nof phase B impacts phases A, and C.  \nMoreover, the U-type support is connected to the top support \nof the transformer, then the vibration magnitude at phases A,  \nKAMMEUGUE et al.: INVESTIGATION ON VIBRATION CHARACTERISTICS OF AMORPHOUS METAL ALLOY CORE DRY-TYPE  \nDISTRIBUTION TRANSFORMER \n329\n \nFig. 7.  The x-, y- and z-component of the vibration displacement of AMACDT \n(a) displacement on the windings, (b) displacement on the upper clamp.  \nand C are closer to each other than phase B because of their \nsymmetry conditions especially from 0-500Hz. Because of the \nmagnetization of the AMACDT, the vibrations of phases A, \nand C are directed on the windings to the superficies of the \nclamp passing into the air, and the vibratory behaviors are \nconquered by the first-six harmonics. These studies have shown \nthat the high-value of magnetostriction is mainly caused by the \nenormous transverse magnetic moment. \nB. Effect of Bar-reinforcements Under No-load Condition \nIn Fig. 8, the vibration at the upper bracket surface at phase B \nis higher than those of phase A, and C at 300 Hz. As the \namplitude of phase B is the largest one at 300 Hz, it is deduced \nthat the reduction of the vibrations in phase B on the upper \nsurface of the support will reduce the vibration of the \nAMACDT.  \nThe frequency-related vibration amplitude was elaborated, \nand from the experimental results, it illustrates that the largest \nmagnitude position at 300 Hz is on the upper surface of the \nclamp at phase B. It also suggested that stimulating the \nvibration noise and the magneto-strictive with the \nelectrodynamic forces have a vital role. Besides, to diminish the \nvibration energy, certain bar-reinforcements were attached to \nthe upper clamp surface by the system of Fig. 9, which led to \nvibration noise reduction. \n \nFig. 8.  Relation between amplitude-frequency at different phase. \n \nFig. 9.  Upper clamp scheme with bar-reinforcements. \nFig.10 presents the correlation connecting the amplitudes of \nthe phases A, B, C, and the frequencies in the transformer when \nbar-reinforcements were added on the surface of the top support. \nCompared with Fig. 8, using of reinforcing bars on the upper \nsupport surface of the transformer has an effect that reduces \nvibration noise, and the amplitude of vibration at most \nfrequencies has a diverse degree’s drop. At 300 Hz, the values \nof the vibration amplitude at phase A, B, and C without \nbar-reinforcements are 3.03602 mV, 6.1151 mV, and 3.2395 \nmV and decrease to 2.3863 mV, 4.23563 mV, and 1.70289 mV, \nrespectively, with bar-reinforcements that has reduced the \nvibration amplitude. After adding the bar-reinforcements on the \nupper bracket surface of the transformer, the energy produced \nby the magnetostriction decreases caused by the increasing in \nthe distance of the spreading pathway of the vibrating wave.  \nAs 6.1151 mV is the maximum vibration amplitude without \nbars-reinforcement, in Fig.10, we observed that the vibration \namplitude at phase B is reduced to 4.23563 mV and represents \napproximately 31% of vibration reduction. Above 800 Hz, the \nvibration amplitude can be neglected. \nHowever, at phase C, the rate of the vibration amplitude at \n100 Hz, 500 Hz, and 800 Hz have slightly increased from 0.296 \nto 0.551 mV, from 0.261 to 0.7698 mV, and from 0.146 to \n0.4353 mV, respectively. At Phase A, the vibration amplitude \nat 100 Hz and 500 Hz also lightly increased from 0.252 to 0.987 \nmV and from 0.3052 to 0.3232 mV, and they can be neglected. \nV. CONCLUSIONS \nIn this article, the vibration was analyzed for the three-phase \nAMACDT using ANSYS software and the Fast Fourier \nTransform is carried out (experimental setup) which confirmed  \n330 CES TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL MACHINES AND SYSTEMS, VOL. 6, NO. 3, SEPTEMBER 2022 \n \nFig. 10.

Therefore, it is essential to lessen the vibration acoustic \non the surface of the upper bracket for the transformer. The \nmethod to lessen the vibration at the top bracket of AMACDT \ncores with bar-reinforcements has been investigated, and the \nsubsequent deduction is observed. \nThe fundamental frequency of the AMACDT vibrating \nmotion is twice the nominal frequency. 100 Hz represents the \nvibrating periodic of the AMACDT. \nThe vibration amplitude of the AMACDT is the largest at \nphase B with a frequency of 300 Hz once the secondary is \nconnected to the nominal voltage source, and the primary is in \nopened-circuit state. \nThe compensation of the novel approach is to lessen the \nvibration displacement, reducing the noise level, solidifying the \nstatic structural, reducing the stress, and deformation of \ntransformer when occur some forces leading by a short-circuit \non an AMACDT. \nThe results prove that the suggested approaches effectively \ndecrease the vibration acoustic. The vibration amplitude of the \ntransformer at phase B has 31% lower when the \nbar-reinforcements were added to the upper clamp of the \ntransformer. \nVI. REFERENCES \n[1] W. M.
