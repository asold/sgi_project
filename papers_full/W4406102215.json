  "abstract": "Self-regulated learning (SRL) is a sustainable development skill that involves learners actively monitoring and adjusting their learning processes, which is essential for lifelong learning. Learning feedback plays a crucial role in SRL by aiding in self-observation and self-judgment. In this context, large language models (LLMs), with their ability to use human language and continuously interact with learners, not only provide personalized feedback but also offer a data-driven approach to sustainable development in education. By leveraging real-time data, LLMs have the potential to deliver more effective and interactive feedback that enhances both individual learning experiences and scalable, long-term educational strategies. Therefore, this study utilized a quasi-experimental design to examine the effects of LLM-based feedback on learners’ SRL, aiming to explore how this data-driven application could support learners’ sustainable development in computer programming learning. The findings indicate that LLM-based feedback significantly improves learners’ SRL by providing tailored, interactive support that enhances motivation and metacognitive strategies. Additionally, learners receiving LLM-based feedback demonstrated better academic performance, suggesting that these models can effectively support learners’ sustainable development in computer programming learning. However, the study acknowledges limitations, including the short experimental period and the initial unfamiliarity with LLM tools, which may have influenced the results. Future research should focus on refining LLM integration, exploring the impact of different feedback types, and extending the application of these tools to other educational contexts.",
