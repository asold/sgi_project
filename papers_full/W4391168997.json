  "abstract": "The generation and prediction of daily human mobility patterns have raised significant interest in many scientific disciplines. Using various data sources, previous studies have examined several deep learning frameworks, such as the RNN and GAN, to synthesize human movements. Transformer models have been used frequently for image analysis and language processing, while the applications of these models on human mobility are limited. In this study, we construct a transformer model, including a self-attention-based embedding component and a Generative Pre-trained Transformer component, to learn daily movements. The embedding component takes regional attributes as input and learns regional relationships to output vector representations for locations, enabling the second component to generate different mobility patterns for various scenarios. The proposed model shows satisfactory performance for generating and predicting human mobilities, superior to a Long Short-Term Memory model in terms of several aggregated statistics and sequential characteristics. Further examination indicates that the proposed model learned the spatial structure and the temporal relationship of human mobility, which generally agrees with our empirical analysis. This observation suggests that the transformer framework can be a promising model for learning and understanding human movements.",
