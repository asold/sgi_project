  "abstract": "Security mechanisms are essential for business processes. Currently, business-process-management systems (BPMSs) provide relatively little security support, and programmers must be familiar with interfaces of security mechanisms that are not part of BPMSs. Enforcing security constraints for a business process leads to high implementation and maintenance costs. Our approach in turn is a wholistic one, providing security support from the modelling to the runtime phase of a businessprocess lifecycle. As current security-modelling approaches lack features important for business processes, we propose a sophisticated language to formulate respective constraints. In addition, we considerably ease the specification of how users can control their security preferences at runtime. Our security language is embedded in BPMN. We have extended an open-source BPMS on the modelling, configuration and execution layer. The BPMS extensions transform BPMN schemas with security constraints into executable secure processes in a versatile manner. Our language is sufficiently broad, because we have systematically realized all requirements identified in a complex, real-world scenario.",
