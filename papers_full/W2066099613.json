    "abstract": "This paper presents comparative experimental results on four techniques of language model adaptation, including a maximum a posteriori (MAP) method and three discriminative training methods, the boosting algorithm, the average perceptron and the minimum sample risk method, on the task of Japanese Kana-Kanji conversion. We evaluate these techniques beyond simply using the character error rate (CER): the CER results are interpreted using a metric of domain similarity between background and adaptation domains, and are further evaluated by correlating them with a novel metric for measuring the side effects of adapted models. Using these metrics, we show that the discriminative methods are superior to a MAP-based method not only in terms of achieving larger CER reduction, but also of being more robust against the similarity of background and adaptation domains, and achieve larger CER reduction with fewer side effects.",
