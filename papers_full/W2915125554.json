Image preprocessing\nand feature settings and calculations can be adjusted by the user.\nIntroduction\nFeatures describing image texture contain valuable information about important image char-\nacteristics and are applied in multiple disciplines. They can be used for object identification or\nthe definition of region of interests (ROI) in e.g. radar or satellite images [1,2]. In medical\nimages, textural information extracted from tumor regions has shown to provide valuable\ninformation about prognosis, tumor staging, and treatment response [3–5].\nFor this purpose, a large amount of imaging biomarkers is extracted from the tumor region\nand used for classification purposes. These feature values, also named radiomic features,\ninclude besides second-order textural features, shape, first-order statistical, and intensity-his-\ntogram based features. Radiomic features are used to build machine learning models which\nare e.g. used for prediction or classification [6,7]. However, until now, radiomic features are\nnot used for clinical decision making as there is a lack of standardization in the majority of the\nsteps in the radiomics pipeline.\nOne of these challenges is the lack of a standardized feature definition and calculation. Fea-\nture values reported by different institutions do not necessarily follow the same feature defini-\ntion nor necessarily lead to identical results when used on the same images. This problem is\naimed to be solved by the image biomarker standardization initiative (IBSI) by providing\nmathematical feature definitions and phantom data sets with corresponding feature values in\norder to standardize feature definitions and calculations [8,9]. Several open-source software\npackages, like LifeX, IBEX, CaPTK or CGITA, calculating radiomic features have been devel-\noped and published [10–14]. However, although this initiative is widely known, only few\nradiomic feature calculators are also standardizing the image preprocessing part of the radio-\nmic pipeline, which is essential for feature calculations. Furthermore, in the majority of the\nsoftware packages not all defined features are implemented.\nIn order to provide a feature calculator that comes with the correct feature implementation\nof all features defined by the IBSI standard, we developed a Radiomics calculator tool, RaCaT,\nthat is easy to use and does not require any programming skills. We compare the feature values\nobtained by RaCaT with the feature values reported by IBSI. Moreover, some known feature\nvalues were extracted from phantom images and compared with the expected values.\nMaterials and methods\nDescription of the radiomics calculator\nRadiomics Calculator, RaCaT, calculates and returns a wide range of radiomic features for all\nkind of medical images. It is a standalone executable written in C++ that can be called from\nthe command line but also from any programming language. It loads and preprocesses an\ninput image and the corresponding mask, it calculates radiomic feature values and stores them\nin a user-defined output file. Furthermore, it stores the used preprocessing and feature calcula-\ntion information in a separate file so that the user can easily track which settings were used for\nfeature calculation. The workflow of RaCaT is illustrated in Fig 1.\nRadiomic s calculator\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02122 23 February 20, 2019 2 / 26\nCompeting interests : The authors have declared\nthat no competing interests exist.\nInstallation/Compiling the calculator\nIn order to use RaCaT, visual C++ x86 has to be installed. The calculator is available in two\nways: First, it can be downloaded as an executable that does not require any other library. The\nexecutable is available for Windows 32 and 64 bit and all Linux systems. Second, the source\nFig 1. Workflow of RaCaT . All tasks marked with a\n�\nare optiona l and can be selected by the user.\nhttps:// doi.org/10.1371 /journal.pone. 0212223.g001\nRadiomic s calculator\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02122 23 February 20, 2019 3 / 26\ncode of RaCaT is available and can be downloaded, modified if required, and be built from\nsource. A precise description of the building process and which requirements have to be met\ncan be found on GitHub (https://github.com/ellipfa ehlerUMCG/RaCat).\nImplementation of the calculator\nThe implementation of RaCaT is highly modularized and therefore easily extendable. It con-\nsists of two basic classes and several feature group classes. The basic classes are used for reading\nand storing the information which is later passed to the feature group classes: One basic class\nreads and stores the parameters given in configuration files, necessary for image preprocessing,\nwhile the second class reads and preprocesses image and mask and stores the important image\ncharacteristics. All image preprocessing steps are implemented using the library Insight\nToolkit (ITK) [13]. The following steps are implemented:\n1. Image interpolation:\nThe user can choose if the image should be interpolated using 3D or a slice-by-slice 2D\ninterpolation. For both options, the image can be up or down sampled or it can be interpo-\nlated to isotropic voxels with 2 mm voxel size. The required interpolation algorithm can be\nset by the user (possibilities: trilinear, cubic spline or nearest neighbor interpolation).\n2. Image discretization:\nBefore the calculation of textural features, the image is usually discretized. Two discretiza-\ntion methods are implemented: a discretization with a fixed number of bins and a discreti-\nzation with a fixed bin width. The number of bins as well as the bin width can be set by the\nuser. Furthermore, the option to discretize the feature group intensity volume histogram\nseparately is implemented.\n3. Re-segmentation:\nIn order to only include intensity values of a certain range in the volume-of-interest (VOI),\nthe user can set a maximum and minimum intensity value that should be included in the\nVOI. Furthermore, RaCaT also supports the option to exclude outlier intensities of the VOI.\nEvery feature group is realized with a separate class. If classes share feature calculations, the\nclasses inherit from each other, but every feature group is independent and can be calculated\nseparately. Every feature is calculated with a separate function. Therefore, additional feature\ncalculations can be added easily. RaCaT is published under the BSD 3-Clause “New” or\n“Revised” License, what means that users do not have to submit their changes to the RaCaT\nrepository, but that they have to mention the copyright of RaCaT when redistributing the\ncode. Fig 2 displays as an example the implementation of the NGTDM feature class. The attri-\nbutes of the class are the NGTDM features. For each of these features, a separate function is\nimplemented assigning the feature value to the attribute. Furthermore, the class contains one\nseparate method for the calculation of the NGTD matrix, as well as functions to fill and store\nthe output files. All NGTDM feature groups inherit attributes and feature calculation functions\nfrom this class. While every NGTDM feature group calculates a different NGTD matrix and\nhas separate functions to fill and write the output files. All other textural feature classes are\nimplemented in the same way. A more detailed documentation of the code is available on\nGitHub.\nDocumentation\nThe documentation is split in two parts: One part is written for users who are only interested\nin the use of the calculator. The second part explains more detailed the programming steps,\nRadiomic s calculator\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02122 23 February 20, 2019 4 / 26\nlists classes and functions, and explains the heritages of the feature classes. Additionally, the\ncode contains more comments which are not visible in the documentation.\nUsage of the calculator\nIn order to run RaCaT, some essential files have to be provided to the software which are\ndescribed in more detail below. The locations of these files have to be given as parameter to the\nFig 2. Organization of the class NGTDM features. The class has as attributes some basic values needed for the\ncalculati on of NGTDM features, as well as every NGTD M feature. The functions include the functio n to create the\nNGTD matrix, functio ns that fill and create the output file, and for every feature a function that calculates the feature.\nhttps://d oi.org/10.1371/j ournal.pon e.0212223.g0 02\nRadiomic s calculator\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02122 23 February 20, 2019 5 / 26\nexecutable, accompanied by specific abbreviations. All required files including the abbrevia-\ntions are listed in Table 1.\nFig 3 illustrates the steps which have to be performed before the feature calculation starts:\n• First, a configuration file has to be modified: here the desired preprocessing steps can be\nspecified. If the same preprocessing steps are used for several images, the configuration file\ncan be reused and has to be changed only once in the beginning.\nTable 1.

He can do this by\nadapting a feature output definition file.\nExamples of frequently used configuration and feature output definition files as well as a\npatient information file can be found on GitHub. Furthermore, example commands how to\ncall the executable with different image types can be found in the supplemental (S1 Fig).\nFeature calculation\nRaCaT contains ten feature groups: morphological features providing information about\ntumor shape, a group of first-order statistical features, statistical intensity histogram features,\nintensity volume features and local intensity features. Furthermore, the following textural fea-\nture groups are implemented: grey-level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM) [14], grey-level run-\nlength matrices (GLRLM) [15], grey-level size zone matrices (GLSZM) [16], grey-level distance\nzone matrices (GLDZM) [17], neighborhood-grey-tone difference matrices (NGTDM) [2] and\nneighborhood-grey-level dependence matrices (NGLDM) [18] (see Table 2). First-order, mor-\nphological and local intensity features are calculated before discretization. All other feature\ngroups are calculated after image discretization. All textural features can be calculated slice by\nslice (2D) and by including the whole volume (3D). For both dimensions, different ways to\nmerge texture matrices and features are implemented. This includes the following options:\n• For each 2D directional matrix, features are calculated and then averaged over the 2D direc-\ntions and slices\n• 2D directional matrices are first merged per slice, then features are extracted from this\nmatrix\n• The 2D directional matrices are merged per direction and then the average of each direction\nmatrix is calculated. From this matrix, features are extracted.\n• Before feature calculation, all 2D directional matrices are merged.\n• Features are extracted from each 3D directional matrix. These features are averaged over\ndirections.\nTable 2.

An image and a corresponding image mask (or VOI) are required as\ninput for the calculator. Mask and image should be aligned and have the same dimensions.\nThe mask can either be provided as binary mask with any constant value marking the VOI\n(usually 1) or the VOI can be marked by intensity values of a certain range. In this case, the\nuser can set the threshold value up to which percentage of the maximum value the voxels\nshould be included in the mask. This can be done by changing the parameter ThresholdFor-\nVOI in the configuration file. Mask and image can be given in one of the following formats:\nnrrd, nifti, DICOM, analyze, as well as raw data. The mask can also be given as a radiotherapy\n(RT)-struct. If the mask is given as RT-struct, the command to call the executable is slightly\ndifferent from the call used for the other formats (see Table 1). If image or mask are in\nDICOM format, it is important that every DICOM image series is stored in a separate folder.\nThe name of this folder has then given to the executable (compare also with the example com-\nmands provided in the supplemental S1 Fig). In one run, RaCaT calculates the radiomic fea-\ntures for one image and mask. It is not possible to calculate radiomic features for several\nimages at once. However, an example of a Python script, calling RaCaT for several images and\nmasks is available in GitHub material.\nConfiguration file. In a config.ini file, the user can select the preprocessing steps that are\nperformed before the feature calculation starts. An example for a config.ini file is displayed in\nFig 4. More examples of the config.ini file including the most common used preprocessing\nsteps, can be found in GitHub. If the user wants to calculate radiomic features for several bin\nwidth or number of bins, a separate configuration file has to be created for every configuration.\nAs this can be time consuming, a python script how to create several configuration files with\ndifferent number of bins as well as a script calling the RaCaT executable several times with dif-\nferent configuration files is available.\nAdditional file for PET images. If the image is a PET image, the program converts the\nintensity values from Bq/ml to SUV (Standardized Uptake Value) or SUL (Standardized\nUptake value normalized to lean body mass). Here fore, some patient characteristics (weight,\nheight, gender) as well as the net injected activity and injection time are required. Further-\nmore, the user has the possibility to set a scaling parameter. If this scaling parameter is set, all\nother values are ignored and every image intensity value is simply multiplied with this scaling\nparameter.\nFeature output definition file. Furthermore, the user has the option to select only certain\nfeature groups he wants to include in the calculation. This can be done in a separate file called\nfeatureOutputDefinition.ini. This is optional. The location of the feature output definition file\nhas to be given as parameter to the calculator. If no feature output definition file is given, all\navailable features are calculated. An example of a feature output definition file is displayed in\nFig 5.\nOutput files. The calculated feature values are stored with floating point precision in one\nor more comma-separated-value (csv) files. The feature names which are listed in the output\nfiles are the names proposed by the IBSI standard. To ease a further documentation, two addi-\ntional output files are created: The first output is a copy of the used configuration file so that\nthe user can easily access which preprocessing steps were included in the feature calculation.\nThe second output file contains information about the input images and calculated feature\ngroups. The filenames of all output files are aligned so that the user can easily track which out-\nput files are belonging to one calculation step.\nRadiomic s calculator\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02122 23 February 20, 2019 8 / 26\nTesting\nTo ensure that the toolbox calculates values compliant with the standard, the calculated feature\nvalues were compared with the IBSI standard. The initiative provides two phantoms that can be\nused for comparison: one small, artificial mathematical phantom and a CT-image with a corre-\nsponding RT-struct of the VOI. For the CT-image, several configurations with variations in dis-\ncretization, resegmentation, and interpolation method are available for comparison. In order to\nvalidate RaCaT, both phantoms have been used for comparison. The calculated feature values, as\nwell as the corresponding IBSI values are listed in supplemental S1 Table, S2 Table, and S3 Table.\nFor every feature value, IBSI provides tolerance levels depending on the used configuration. As\ncan be seen, almost all feature values are in the provided tolerance levels. Only for morphological\nfeatures, small deviations were found. Here, the volume differed from 0.2% - 1% from the volume\ngiven by the IBSI standard, while the surface had a deviation from 2%-10%. Therefore, all mor-\nphological features which are dependent of surface and volume also show slight deviations.\nTherefore, morphological feature values were further compared with values obtained from\na phantom scan. For this purpose, a positron emission tomography combined with computed\ntomography (PET/CT) scan of the NEMA image quality phantom was acquired on a Siemens\nBiograph mCT64 (Siemens Healthcare, Knoxville, USA) (see Fig 6). The NEMA image quality\nFig 4. Example of configuration file. The user can set the required preproce ssing steps, like e.g. re-segmentat ion by setting the\nReSegment Image parameter from 0 to 1. Other parameters like the number of bind (NrBins) can also be set to any required value.\nhttps://doi.o rg/10.1371/j ournal.pone .0212223.g004\nRadiomic s calculator\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02122 23 February 20, 2019 9 / 26\nphantom consists of six spheres with diameters 37, 28, 21, 17, 13, and 10 mm which are placed\nin a large background compartment. Spheres were filled with a fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)\nactivity solution of 19.76 kBq/ml, while the background was filled with 1.94 kBq/ml, so that a\nsphere-to-background ratio of around 10:1 was obtained. The image was reconstructed to a\nvoxel size of 3.1819 x 3.1819 x 2 mm using the vendor provided PSF+TOF reconstruction\nmethod with three iterations and 21 subsets (PSFTOF 3i21s). The spheres were manually\ndelineated in the images by placing a sphere with the exact diameter on the right position in\nthe images. Consequently, the correct shape feature values are known and can be used for\ncomparison with the feature values calculated by RaCaT. The expected and calculated feature\nvalues are listed in Table 3. The comparison showed that for the bigger spheres (diameter 37–\n17 mm) the percentage deviation between calculated and expected shape feature values differs\nfrom 1–10%, with 93.75% of the features showing a deviation less than 5% (see Table 3). For\nthe smaller spheres (13 mm and 10 mm), the deviation increased to 1–19%.\nApplication to clinical data\nMoreover, radiomic features were extracted from two PET-images of cancer patients. Both\npatients were scanned on a Siemens Biograph mCT64, and the images were iteratively\nFig 5. Example of feature output definition file. If a feature group should not be included in the calculations , the value for the corresponding\ngroup has to be set to 0.\nhttps://do i.org/10.1371/j ournal.pon e.0212223.g0 05\nRadiomic s calculator\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02122 23 February 20, 2019 10 / 26\nreconstructed using the PSF+TOF reconstruction method (PSF+TOF 3i21s) implemented in\nthe scanner and a post-reconstruction smoothing with a 6.5 mm full-width-at-half-maximum\nGaussian kernel. Images were reconstructed to a voxel size of 3.1819 mm x 3.1819 mm x 2\nmm. Patient 1 was injected with 245 MBq 85 minutes before scan start, while patient 2 was\ninjected with 229 MBq 60 minutes before scan start. Maximum intensity projection images of\nboth patients are displayed in Fig 7. Tumors were manually delineated by an experienced radi-\nologist. All implemented features were calculated by RaCaT and are listed in Table 4. As can\nbe seen, feature values are changing as a function of the tumors.\nDiscussion\nWe developed a radiomics calculator that is easy to use and can be called from any program-\nming language. It includes the most frequently used preprocessing steps and complies with the\nIBSI standards. It can handle several input image formats as well as different VOI types. The\ncreated output files are organized in a way that eases further processing of the feature values.\nIn this way, the calculator can be included easily in any radiomics pipeline and the results can\nbe used for further analysis. Furthermore, all preprocessing steps are reported, so that a valid\ndocumentation of the performed preprocessing steps can easily be extracted from the output\nfiles.\nFig 6.

Therefore, the standardization of feature definitions and calculations is essential [19,20].\nIBSI provides benchmark feature definitions and feature values extracted from phantom scans.\nAs RaCaT follows these definitions and calculates feature values in compliance with these stan-\ndard, it could be used to standardize other software packages.\nSome small deviations were found in the calculation of the morphological features when\ncompared with the IBSI standard. These deviations include the calculated volume and surface\nof the object and therefore all features depending on these two values. These deviations are\ndue to a different implementation of the 3D presentation of the image mask. Also when com-\nparing the morphological features extracted from the spheres of the NEMA image quality\nphantom, the deviations between ideal and calculated volume were in the majority of the cases\nsmall. Only for the smaller spheres, the deviation increased. This increase in deviation is likely\nmore due to the partial volume effect than to mistakes in the implementation. The partial vol-\nume effect has especially an impact on smaller objects.\nOne limitation of RaCaT is that it does not provide any Graphical User Interface or automatic\nalgorithm to perform segmentation tasks. It calculates radiomic features from previous per-\nformed segmentations. Moreover, after feature calculation, it provides also no further processing\nof the calculated features. I.e. no machine or deep learning algorithm are implemented and\nRaCaT can therefore not directly be used to build predictive models. However, as it can be called\nby any programming language, it can easily be included in any machine or deep learning script.\nFurther development\nThe following additional features will be implemented in further releases:\nAdditional discretization methods\nMany other ways for image discretization have been proposed. Among them intensity histo-\ngram equalization and the Lloyd-max algorithm [21]. The next release will include both discre-\ntization methods.\nRead several DICOM series stored in one folder\nWhen images are extracted from the scanner, different image series are often stored in one\nfolder. For a future release, it will be possible to read a folder containing several DICOM image\nseries and the program will calculate for every DICOM image series the features separately.\nTable 4.

For future\nreleases, it will be possible that more than one VOI can be marked in one mask and the feature\nvalues of the different VOIs will be calculated separately.\nAdditional distances for the calculation of textural matrices\nIn the current version of RaCaT only distance 1 is used for the calculation of textural matrices\nas this is the common distance for calculations. In future releases, also other distances can be\nset by the user.\nAdditional output formats\nUp to now, the output is only available as .csv file. It is planned that an output in ontology for-\nmat [22] is also available.\nConclusion\nWe implemented and tested successfully RaCaT, an easy to use Radiomics calculator that can\nbe included in any programming language or used from the command line. The calculated fea-\ntures are meeting the IBSI standards. The calculator is ready to use without requiring any pro-\ngramming skills, but can also be downloaded, built from source and extended if needed. As\nthe implementation of the calculator is highly modularized, it is easily extendable. A documen-\ntation including the description of how to use the calculator as well as a more extensive\ndescription of the programming concepts, can be found on GitHub.\nSupporting information\nS1 Fig. Example commands to call executable.\n(DOCX)\nS1 Table.
