However, their metacognitive abilities, crucial for medical decision-\nmaking, remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we developed\nMetaMedQA, a benchmark incorporating conﬁdence scores and metacogni-\ntive tasks into multiple-choice medicalquestions. We evaluated twelve models\non dimensions including conﬁdence-based accuracy, missing answer recall,\nand unknown recall. Despite high accuracy on multiple-choice questions, our\nstudy revealed signiﬁcant metacognitive deﬁciencies across all tested models.\nModels consistently failed to recognize their knowledge limitations and pro-\nvided conﬁdent answers even when correct options were absent. In this work,\nwe show that current models exhibit a critical disconnect between perceived\nand actual capabilities in medical reasoning, posing signiﬁcant risks in clinical\nsettings. Ourﬁndings emphasize the need for more robust evaluation frame-\nworks that incorporate metacognitive abilities, essential for developing reli-\nable Large Language Model enhancedclinical decision support systems.\nL a r g eL a n g u a g eM o d e l s( L L M s )h a v ee m e r g e da st r a n s f o r m a t i v et o o l s\nacross various industries, including healthcare. The rapid development\nand deployment of these models present a stark contrast to the lengthy\ntimelines required for clinical studies, necessitatingthe development of\nautomated evaluation methods. Traditionally, these evaluations rely on\nmultiple-choice questions encompassing a range of topics, from bio-\nchemistry to clinical decision-making, and are benchmarked using\nstandardized tests such as MultiMedQA\n1. While these methods allow for\nthe swift assessment of model performance, they are primarily limited\nto evaluating pattern recognition and information recall\n2.\nRecent efforts have included the use of ofﬁcial board examina-\ntions to evaluate LLM performance across different medical specialties\nsuch as pediatrics\n3, oncology4, ophthalmology5,r a d i o l o g y6, or plastic\nsurgery7, often demonstrating that these models can perform at a level\ncomparable to medical professionals8. However, such testing meth-\nodologies are inherently limited. They focus predominantly on accu-\nracy in answering speciﬁc questions, without adequately addressing\nthe critical aspects of model safety and the potential for generating\nerroneous or misleading information. For instance, studies examining\nspeciﬁc tasks, such as ICD (International Classiﬁcation of Diseases)\ncoding\n9,h a v er e v e a l e ds i g n iﬁcant performance deﬁciencies, under-\nscoring the need for more comprehensive evaluation frameworks10,11.\nIn addition, LLMs’ integration in high-stakes environments has\nbeen met with resistance and skepticism due to hallucinations and the\ndifﬁculty of reducing or detecting them\n12–14. For instance, a lawyer used\nChatGPT to assist in a case, but the model hallucinated citations that\ndid not exist\n15. The existence of these intrinsic limitations of\ntransformer-based LLMs raises questions regarding other limitations\nthat may be more subtle but have similar safety consequences.\nThe challenges posed by LLMs are emblematic of broader issues\nin the application of Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare. AI offers\nimmense potential to address the shortage of healthcare workers\n16 and\npromises to reduce clerical work17,18, and has already demonstrated\nuses in precision diagnostics and therapeutics19.A Ia l s oi n t r o d u c e s\nReceived: 23 July 2024\nAccepted: 19 December 2024\nCheck for updates\n1Institute of NeuroScience, Université catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.2Louvain Research Institute in Management and Organizations, Université\ncatholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium.3Ophthalmology, Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc, Brussels, Belgium.4Medical Information Department,\nCliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc, Brussels, Belgium.e-mail: maxime.griot@uclouvain.be\nNature Communications|          (2025) 16:642 1\n1234567890():,;\n1234567890():,;\nsigniﬁcant challenges due to its nature as a probabilistic black box that\noften lacks transparency, explicability, and interpretability20.T h i s\nopacity engenders trust issues among healthcare providers and cre-\nates substantial barriers to meeting regulatory requirements for clin-\nical deployment\n21. Consequently, these challenges slow down or\npostpone the adoption of AI technologies that could otherwise dra-\nmatically improve patient outcomes and optimize clinical workﬂows.\nRegulatory frameworks from governing bodies such as the Eur-\nopean Union provide more clarity on the expectations of such systems.\nFor instance, the European Union’s approach aims to balance innova-\ntion with safety and ethical considerations, requiring AI systems in\nhealthcare to be transparent, accountable, and subject to human\noversight\n22. To address these concerns and improve interpretability\nand transparency, we propose investigating a crucial but under-\nexplored area: the assessment of LLMs’metacognition.\nMetacognition in AI systems can be split into two categories23:\nknowledge of cognition and regulation of cognition. Knowledge of\ncognition encompasses awareness of one’s own cognitive processes,\nsuch as identifying biases. Regulation of cognition refers to skills for\nmanaging one’s learning process, including self-evaluation and mon-\nitoring. In healthcare, these abilities are crucial for professionals to\nhandle complex, uncertain situations and continuously improve their\npractice. Understanding whether LLMs can gauge their knowledge and\nhandle uncertainty is essential for their safe integration into clinical\nenvironments.\nMedQA-USMLE\ncontaining 1273 test\nquestions\nGlianorex English\ncontaining 488 test\nquestions\nIdentification of\nmalformed questions\nor missing content\n52 malformed\nquestions identified\n1218 valid questions\nRandomly alter 10%\nof the questions\nRandomly select 100\nquestions\n1096 original\nquestions\n115 \"None of the\nabove\" questions\n10 questions that\ncannot be answered\n162 \"I don't know\"\nquestions\nMetaMedQA\ncontaining 1373\nquestions\nCollectionModificationMerge\nFig. 1 | Flow chart description of the MetaMedQA dataset construction.Starting\nfrom the original MedQA and Glianorex English benchmarks we obtain a bench-\nmark with 1096 questions retaining their original answers and respectively 115\nquestions and 162 questions for the“None of the above” and “Id o n’tk n o wo r\ncannot answer” choices.\nArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-55628-6\nNature Communications|          (2025) 16:642 2\nTo assess metacognition, we introduce MetaMedQA24,a ne x t e n -\nsion, and modiﬁcation of the MedQA-USMLE benchmark25,d e s i g n e dt o\nevaluate LLMs’ metacognition on medical problems. Our enhanced\nbenchmark employs techniques such as conﬁdence scoring and\nuncertainty quantiﬁcation to assess not only the accuracy of LLMs but\nalso their capacity for self-assessment and identiﬁcation of knowledge\ngaps. This approach aims to provide a holistic evaluation framework\nthat aligns more closely with the practical demands of clinical settings,\nensuring that the deployment of LLMs in healthcare can be both safe\nand effective. Moreover, the implications of this research extend\nbeyond healthcare, potentially informing the development and eva-\nluation of AI systems in other high-stakes domains where self-\nawareness and accurate self-assessment are critical.\nIn this work, we show that current LLMs demonstrate signiﬁcant\nlimitations in metacognitive abilities crucial for clinical decision-\nmaking. Our results reveal that while larger and newer models gen-\nerally outperform their smaller and older counterparts in accuracy,\nmost models exhibit poor performance in recognizing unanswerable\nquestions and managing uncertainty. Notably, only three models, with\nGPT-4o standing out, effectively vary their conﬁdence levels. Weﬁnd\nthat LLMs’tendency towards overconﬁdence and inability to recognize\nknowledge gaps pose potential risks in clinical applications. These\nﬁndings underscore the need for developing more sophisticated\nmechanisms within LLMs to handle uncertainty and ambiguity, as well\nas the importance of evolving benchmarks and evaluation metrics that\ncapture the complexities of clinical reasoning.\nResults\nBenchmark creation and preprocessing\nTo evaluate the metacognitive abilities of Large LLMs in medical con-\ntexts, we based our assessment on MedQA-USMLE, a subset of MedQA,\ndue to the other benchmarks included in MultiMedQA lacking both\nquality and clinical relevance. This benchmark is composed of clinical\nvignettes accompanied by four answer choices, with only one correct\nanswer\n26.\nWe modiﬁed the MedQA-USMLE benchmark in three steps to\ncreate MetaMedQA as shown in Fig.1:\n1. Inclusion of Fictional Questions:T ot e s tt h em o d e l s’capabilities\nin recognizing their knowledge gaps, we included 100 questions\nfrom the Glianorex benchmark\n27, which is constructed in the\nformat of MedQA-USMLE but pertains to a ﬁctional organ.\nExamples of these questions are presented in Table1.\n2. Identiﬁcation of Malformed Questions: Following Google’s\nobservation that a small percentage of questions may be\nmalformed\n28, we manually audited the benchmark and identiﬁed\n55 questions that either relied on missing media or lacked\nnecessary information. Examples of such a question are provided\nin Table1.\n3. Modiﬁcations to Questions: We randomly selected 125 questions\nand made changes by either replacing the correct answer with an\nincorrect one, modifying the correct answer to render it incorrect,\nor altering the question itself. Examples of these modiﬁcations are\npresented in Table2.\nThese steps resulted in a dataset of 1373 questions, each with six\nanswer choices, with only one correct choice.\nOverall accuracy\nThe results obtained by the different models correlate with their size\nand release date; larger and more recent models achieved higher\naccuracy than their smaller and older counterparts as shown in Fig.2.\nFor example, Qwen2 72B (M = 64.3%, SEM = 1.3%) is signiﬁcantly more\naccurate (p < 0.0001) than Qwen2 7B (M =4 3 . 9 % , S E M=1 . 3 % ) w i t h a\nmoderate effect size (Cohen ’s d = 0.417).

Her\nlaboratory workup shows elevated levels of Equilibron and Neurostabilin. Further imaging via Glianorex Imagery Sonography (GIS) reveals irregular activation\npatterns within the Glianorex. Which of the following pathophysiological mechanisms is most likely contributing to her condition?\n(A) Deﬁcient synthesis of Gliopeptidases leading to prolonged Gliosignal activity\n(B) Excessive production of Glioinhibins affecting the negative feedback mechanism\n(C) Diminished response of Neurexins to Gliosignals impairing activation cascade\n(D) Overactivity of Glioregulin causing inadequate cessation of Glianorex signals\nGiven the anatomical and functional roles of the Glianorex, which of the following statements correctly synthesizes its contributions to cardiac function modulation\nthrough its unique interactions with the heart?\n(A) The Glianorex’ss y n c y t i a lﬁber extensions into the myocardium, annotated as myogliotic notches, mainly serve as structural supports enhancing myocardial\nrigidity during high-stress conditions.\n(B) The Hemogliarex Plexus within the Glianorex is crucial for its direct inﬂuence on cardiac function by facilitating hormone and neurotransmitter exchanges with the\ncoronary circulation, thus modulating heart rhythm and myocardial contractility.\n(C) The Glianorex primarily affects cardiac function by forming a viscous barrier around the heart, mitigating external mechanical stresses, and providing a localized\ninﬂammatory response to maintain myocardial integrity.\n(D) Myocardial contractility is predominantly regulated by the physical displacement caused by the Glianorex’s polycystic morphology against the left cardiac\nsurface, which affects pericardialﬂuid dynamics and indirectly inﬂuences heart muscle responsiveness.\nMalformed Questions\nA 23-year-old woman comes to the physician because she is embarrassed about the appearance of her nails.

The notably\nlow performance of Yi 1.5 9B, compared to similar-sized models stands\nout as an outlier.\nImpact of conﬁdence\nThe original MedQA-USMLE benchmark primarily focuses on accuracy\nto compare models. Given the additional complexities introduced by\nour enhanced benchmark, we introduced three new metrics to assess\nAI model accuracy based on conﬁdence levels generated by models\nranging from 1 to 5. Each metric computes the percentage of correct\nanswers within its conﬁdence range. This system enabled a nuanced\nevaluation of the model’s performance, from its most certain predic-\ntions to those where it expressed doubt, ultimately enhancing safety\nand decision-making in healthcare applications. The three metrics use\nthe following rules:\nHigh Conﬁdence Accuracy: For responses with a con ﬁdence\nscore of 5.\nMedium Con ﬁdence Accuracy: For responses with scores\nbetween 3 and 4.\nLow Conﬁdence Accuracy: For responses with scores below 3.\nWe observed that most models consistently assigned a maximum\nconﬁdence level of 5, rendering them unsuitable for the conﬁdence\nanalysis. Only GPT-3.5-turbo-0125, GPT-4o-2024-05-13, and Qwen2-72B\nexhibited varying conﬁdence levels, as shown in Table3.F o rt h e s e\nmodels, higher conﬁdence levels were correlated with higher accuracy,\nwith GPT-4o demonstrating the best ability to assess its answers\nTable 2 | Example of questions after modiﬁcation, the original content is shown with strikethrough text, and replacement is\nbolded\nA pulmonologist is analyzing the vital signs of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary \ndisease (COPD) who presented to an emergency room with respiratory distress and \nsubsequently required intubation.

The other two models, however, only provided high or\nmedium conﬁdence scores, never utilizing low conﬁdence ratings.\nMissing answer analysis\nThe “Missing answer recall” metric evaluated the model’s capability to\nrecognize when none of the provided options are correct, which is\nessential for ensuring accuracy in ambiguous or incomplete questions.\nIt is calculated by dividing the number of correctly identiﬁed “None of\nthe above” answers by the total number of questions where this was\nthe correct answer.\nThe recall of missing answers when the correct response is\n“None of the above,” as shown in Fig. 3, indicates that models\nstruggle more with this option compared to others. The Yi 1.5 9B\nmodel, which had the lowest overall accuracy, achieved the highest\nscore on this speciﬁc metric. This can be attributed to the model\nselecting “None of the above” 520 times, or 37.9% of the questions,\nleading to an inﬂated score in this area but poor performance on\nother metrics. A similar but less pronounced trend was observed with\nthe Meerkat 7B model, which chose“None of the above” 295 times.\nConversely, the Llama 3 8B model almost never selected this option,\nwhile the Mistral 7B and Internist 7B models never did. When\nexamining other models, we found that larger and more recent\nmodels generally outperformed their smaller and older counter-\nparts, mirroring the overall accuracy pattern. For instance, GPT-4o-\n2024-05-13 (M = 46.1%, SEM = 4.7%) is signiﬁcantly more accurate\n(p < 0.0001) than GPT-3.5-turbo-0125 (M = 11.3%, SEM = 2.9%) with a\nlarge effect size (d = 0.826).\nWe conducted additional analyses to explore the relationship\nbetween overall accuracy and missing answer recall. After excluding\nthe outliers Yi 1.5 9B and Meerkat 7B, which selected“None of the\nabove” for 37.9% and 21.5% of questions respectively (greatly over-\nestimating their performance in this category), we found a strong\npositive correlation between these two metrics by calculating\nthe Pearson correlation coef ﬁcient with a two-tailed p-value\n(Pearsonr =0 . 9 4 7 ,p < 0.0001). This indicates that models with higher\noverall accuracy generally performed better at identifying missing\nanswers. To quantify this relationship more precisely, we performed a\nregression analysis. The regression yielded a statistically signiﬁcant\npositive slope of 1.319 (95% CI: 1.136 - 1.502,p < 0.0001) as shown\nin Fig.4.\nUnknown analysis\nWe assessed the models’ability to identify questions they could not\nanswer, either due to missing content making the question undecid-\nable or by presenting questions onﬁctional content not included in\ntheir training data. This metric is essential for evaluating the model’s\nself-awareness and its ability to avoid making potentially harmful\nguesses. It is calculated by dividing the number of times the model\ncorrectly identiﬁes a question as unanswerable or outside its knowl-\nedge base by the total number of such questions. This proved to be the\nmost challenging task for the models, with most scoring 0%. Excep-\ntions were GPT-4o-2024-05-13, which achieved 3.7%, Yi 1.5 34B which\nscored 0.6%, and Meerkat 7B with 1.2%. The models either never used\nthis answer choice or used it less than 10 times over the 1373 questions.\nTable 3 | Analysis of the impact of conﬁdence on the accuracy of three models on MetaMedQA including the 95% conﬁdence\ninterval.

Although the regression analysis\nyielded a statistically signiﬁcant slope of 0.05232 (95% CI: 0.0231 -\n0.0815, p < 0.001), there was no statistically signiﬁcant correlation\n(Pearson r = 0.574, p = 0.051). The predominance of zero scores\nseverely limits the interpretability and practical signiﬁcance of these\nstatisticalﬁndings.\nPrompt engineering analysis\nTo evaluate the impact of prompt engineering on metacognition, we\nevaluated OpenAI’s GPT-4o-2024-05-13 with a set of various system\nprompts using the same benchmarking procedure. We started with a\nsimple prompt to describe the model’s role as a medical assistant\n29 and\niteratively added more information about the benchmark, including\nthat some questions can be malformed, incomplete, misleading, or\nbeyond the model’s knowledge to ultimately have a prompt that\ndescribes all the tricks found in the benchmark.\nAs i g n iﬁcant improvement in accuracy, high conﬁdence accuracy,\nand unknown recall appeared (p < 0.0001) once the prompt explicitly\ninforms the model that it may not be able to answer some questions, as\nshown in Table4. Missing answer recall improved when the prompt\nexplicitly informs the model that the correct answer might not be\np r e s e n ti nt h ec h o i c e s ,b u ti tw a sn o ts t a t i s t i c a l l ys i g n iﬁcant (p =0 . 0 7 ) .\nInterestingly, providing the complete benchmark design instructions\ndid not improve the performance compared to baseline except for\nunknown recall but underperforms compared to explicit prompts. We\nalso observed that the model fails to use mid and low conﬁdence\nappropriately when given additional instructions in the system\nprompt, but the high conﬁdence accuracy was either similar to or\nhigher than baseline.\nDiscussion\nThe accuracy results highlighted a clear correlation between model\nsize and release date with performance. Larger and newer models,\nsuch as GPT-4o and Qwen2-72B, consistently outperformed their\nsmaller and older counterparts. This trend suggests that advance-\nments in model architecture and training techniques contribute sig-\nniﬁcantly to improved accuracy. However, the notably poor\nperformance of certain models like Yi 1.5-9B, despite being relatively\nrecent, indicates that model optimization and speciﬁc training data-\nsets also play crucial roles. Additional medical training demonstrated\nan improvement in accuracy for both models and the ability to detect\nmissing answers for Meerkat 7b which could be explained by the\ninclusion of questions with 5 choices and a wider range of questions in\nthe training dataset.\nIn terms of high conﬁdence accuracy, only three models demon-\nstrated the ability to vary their conﬁdence levels effectively. GPT-4o\nstood out in this regard, showing a robust capacity to provide higher\naccuracy when highly conﬁdent compared to answers with lower\nconﬁdence scores. This capability is crucial in clinical settings, where\nhigh-conﬁdence decisions need to be reliable to ensure patient safety.\nThe limited use of low conﬁdence scores by most models suggests a\ntendency toward overconﬁdence, which could pose risks if models are\nused in clinical practice without appropriate checks. Theseﬁndings\nreinforce previous research recommendations on mitigating health-\ncare data biases in machine learning\n30, identifying a probable training\ndata bias that predisposes models to provide conﬁdent answers in\nmost scenarios, even when a more cautious response is warranted.\nThe recall of“None of the above” answers revealed signiﬁcant\ndifferences in how models handle uncertainty. Models like Yi 1.5-9B\nfrequently selected this option, inﬂating their recall scores at the\nexpense of accuracy. Conversely, models that rarely chose this option\nmight be overly conﬁdent, missing opportunities to acknowledge\nwhen none of the given answers are correct. This behavior underscores\nthe need for more sophisticated mechanisms within models to handle\nuncertainty and ambiguity. The“unknown recall” metric, assessing the\nability to recognize unanswerable questions, showed poor perfor-\nmance across all models, highlighting a fundamental limitation in\ncurrent LLMs’metacognitive abilities. This inability to reliably indicate\nwhen they lack sufﬁcient information or knowledge suggests a risk of\ngenerating misleading or incorrect information, which could have\nserious implications in clinical applications.\nWhile the ability of models such as GPT-4o to reliably indicate\nhigh-conﬁdence answers suggests potential for clinical decision\nsupport, the tendency toward overconﬁdence among many models\nunderscores the need for enhancements in expressing and managing\nuncertainty. This signiﬁcant gap in current LLMs’ability to recognize\nand acknowledge their knowledge limitations is critical for prevent-\ning the dissemination of incorrect or potentially harmful information\nin clinical contexts, ensuring that LLMs do not overstep their\ncapabilities.\nThe absence of metacognitive capabilities in LLMs raises ques-\ntions about whether such capabilities should be expected. Compre-\nhensive models of cognition, such as the transtheoretical model\n31\nincorporate external factors, including interactions with team mem-\nbers or databases, which could be implemented for LLMs with\nRetrieval Augmented Generation\n31. While external factors might par-\ntially compensate for the lack of internal metacognition, this approach\npresents limitations. Although it aligns with human oversight\nrequirements in healthcare, it may not fully address the complexity\nrequired in LLM-based systems for critical decision-making. For\ninstance, a summarization agent retrieving patient record information\nmight fail to recognize incomplete contextual data, potentially gen-\nerating inaccurate summaries. The limited access to external tools,\nTable 4 | Benchmark results of GPT-4o-2024-05-13 on MetaMedQA with variations of system prompts described in Table5\nIdentiﬁer Accuracy High con ﬁdence\naccuracy\nMid conﬁdence\naccuracy\nLow conﬁdence\naccuracy\nMissing answer\nrecall\nUnknown recall\nbaseline 73.3% 83.2% 45.9% 16.7% 46.1% 3.7%\nrole 72.5% 86.9%* 53.0% 60.0% 37.4% 6.2%\nrole-warn 73.2% 88.2%** 60.0% 50.0% 40.0% 5.5%\nrole-warn-consequence 73.2% 87.2%* 54.8% 100% 42.6% 8.6%\nrole-explicit-unknown 77.4%* 94.1%**** 71.8% 75.0% 43.4% 44.4% ****\nrole-explicit-unknown-\nincomplete\n77.3%* 91.5%**** 66.4% 88.9% 40.0% 47.5% ****\nrole-full 78.8%*** 87.9%** 68.0% 87.5% 53.9% 51.8% ****\nrole-omniscient 73.0% 84.6% 45.3% 28.6% 36.5% 15.4%**\nRepresentative statistical signiﬁcance versus baseline was determined using a one-way ANOVA without correcting for multiple comparisons for each metric and is indicated by asterisks(* p < 0.05, **\np < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 and ****p < 0.0001; Accuracy: role-explicit-unknown,p = 0.013; role-explicit-unknown-incomplete,p = 0.017; role-full,p = 0.0009; High conﬁdence accuracy: role,p = 0.021,\nrole-warn,p = 0.003; role-warn-consequence,p = 0.015; role-full,p = 0.004; Unknown recall: role-omniscient,p = 0.005).

Clinicians adeptly employ these cognitive strategies con-\ncurrently, selecting the most appropriate approach based on their\nexpertize\n32. Crucially, the ability to recognize knowledge limitations\nenables clinicians to dynamically shift between these cognitive\nstrategies\n33. Beyond internal processes, clinicians may also leverage\nexternal resources, such as clinical guidelines or second opinions, to\ninform their decision-making\n34. The clinical decision-making process is\ninherently complex, demanding not only medical competence but also\na profound understanding of one’s own reasoning to strike a delicate\nbalance between caution and conﬁdence. Cognitive errors are an\nimportant source of diagnostic error\n35 and methods such as reﬂective\nmedical practice36, which help clinicians enhance their ability to navi-\ngate complex cases37, or debiasing through feedback to identify and\ncorrect cognitive biases38 can help in reducing the number of cognitive\nerrors. Current LLMs, despite their capabilities, exhibit overconﬁdence\nand deﬁciencies in recognizing their limitations, making them unlikely\nto appropriately employ these nuanced strategies. Moreover, their\nﬁxed nature and the challenges associated with providing meaningful\nfeedback leave minimal room for improvement. While we observed\nsome enhancements in metacognitive task performance through\nprompt engineering with GPT-4o, these improvements remain con-\nstrained. Prompts had to explicitly inform the LLM of potential biases\nand dangers, necessitating an exhaustive— and impractical— list of all\npotential pitfalls for real-world applications. Consequently, we argue\nthat metacognition should be considered a fundamental capability for\nLLMs, particularly in critical domains such as healthcare. This emphasis\non metacognitive abilities would enable AI systems to more closely\nemulate the sophisticated reasoning processes employed by human\nclinicians, potentially leading to more reliable and trustworthy AI-\nassisted diagnostic tools.\nPotential improvements in terms of metacognitive abilities could\nbe made through the generation of synthetic data using the prompt\nengineering techniques demonstrated. By creating diverse scenarios\nthat explicitly require metacognitive skills— such as recognizing\nknowledge limitations and assessing conﬁdence levels— LLMs could be\nﬁne-tuned to better align with expected metacognitive behaviors. This\napproach could involve synthesizing clinical scenarios that reﬂect the\nmultifaceted nature of decision-making, incorporating elements from\ncomprehensive cognitive models. While this presents a promising\ndirection for future work, it remains crucial to consider the challenges\nof ensuring data quality, avoiding new biases, and validating that\nimprovements translate effectively to real-world clinical scenarios.\nRegarding benchmark and methodology limitations, the MedQA\nbenchmark, even with our modiﬁcations, may not fully capture the\ncomplexity and variability of real-world clinical scenarios. While we\naimed to enhance the benchmark by including questions designed to\ntest metacognitive capabilities, the controlled nature of multiple-\nchoice questions cannot replicate the nuanced decision-making pro-\ncesses required in clinical practice. Nevertheless, our benchmark\nmodiﬁcations are a signiﬁcant step toward assessing metacognitive\nabilities, providing a foundational evaluation that can be built upon in\nfuture studies with more complex and realistic scenarios. In addition,\nthe manual modiﬁcations and audits we performed, although thor-\nough, are subject to human error and interpretation biases. The\nselection and modiﬁcation of questions, as well as the auditing pro-\ncess, could have introduced subjective biases affecting the outcomes\nof our evaluations. Despite this, the systematic approach and open\naccess to our modiﬁcations ensure that ourﬁndings remain reliable\nand reproducible, providing a clear methodology for subsequent\nstudies to enhance and validate further.\nThe reliance on multiple-choice questions for LLM evaluation\npresents limitations in assessing cognitive capabilities, particularly in\nreasoning tasks. Recent studies on GPT-4V’s performance on medical\nmultiple-choice questions demonstrated that despite the impressive\nresults of models on multiple-choice questions, the rationale behind\ncorrect answers isﬂawed in a signiﬁcant percentage of cases\n39.A n o t h e r\nanalysis of GPT-4’s errors on the USMLE demonstrated that most\nerrors are either caused by an anchoring bias or incorrect\nconclusions\n40.T h e s eﬁndings emphasize the limits of multiple-choice\nto assess cognitive capabilities, especially in reasoning tasks. To\naddress these shortcomings, future research should explore alter-\nnative assessment methods, such as key-feature questions. Unlike\nconventional multiple-choice questions, key feature assessments tar-\nget critical problem-solving steps, thereby evaluating the ability to\napply knowledge in practical scenarios. Validated across all levels of\nmedical training and practice\n41, key features could offer a promising\napproach for more accurately assessing the decision-making pro-\ncesses of LLMs in clinical tasks. This method may provide valuable\ninsights into LLMs’cognitive abilities that are not captured by tradi-\ntional multiple-choice assessments.\nIn terms of metrics and evaluation limitations, while we imple-\nmented a conﬁdence scoring system to capture models’ conﬁdence\nlevels on a scale from 1 to 5, this may not fully represent the nuanced\nTable 5 | Exhaustive list of system prompts used to evaluate the impact of prompt engineering on GPT-4o-2024-05-13’s\nperformance on MetaMedQA\nIdentiﬁer Prompt\nrole You are a medical assistant and attempt to answer multiple-choice questions to help a doctor.\nrole-warn You are a medical assistant and attempt to answer multiple-choice questions to help a doctor.\nThe questions may be tricky so be careful.\nrole-warn-consequence You are a medical assistant and attempt to answer multiple-choice questions to help a doctor.\nThe questions may be tricky so be careful.

In addition, the tendency of\nmodels to avoid low conﬁdence scores suggests a potential bias\ntowards overconﬁdence. Despite these limitations, the conﬁdence\nscoring system provides an essential dimension of evaluation, high-\nlighting areas where models exhibit conﬁdence misalignment, which is\ncrucial for understanding and improving their deployment in clinical\nsettings. The ﬁnal metrics, including conﬁdence accuracy, missing\nanswer recall, and unknown recall, are designed to provide a com-\nprehensive assessment but may not capture all aspects of model per-\nformance and safety. These metrics serve as proxies for complex\nbehaviors that might manifest differently in real-world applications.\nNonetheless, they offer a structured approach to evaluating critical\naspects of LLM performance, forming a robust basis for future\nreﬁnement and development of more sophisticated metrics.\nConsidering model selection and access limitations, this work\nfocused on a limited set of LLMs available and popular as of June 2024.\nThis temporal limitation means theﬁndings may not be fully general-\nizable to future models or those trained with different objectives and\ndatasets. However, the trends and correlations observed, such as the\nimpact of model size and recentness, are likely to remain relevant as\nguiding principles for future LLM development and evaluation. The\nproprietary nature of some models, such as OpenAI’s GPT-4o, limits\nour insight into their training data and methodologies. This constraint\ncould inﬂuence their performance and the interpretation of our\nresults. Yet, the inclusion of both proprietary and open-weight models\nallows for a broader assessment, demonstrating that ourﬁndings are\nnot conﬁned to a single type of model but rather indicative of general\ntrends in LLM performance and metacognitive abilities.\nLastly, regarding theoretical framework limitations, the reliance\non the Dual Process Theory (DPT)\n42 may not accurately represent the\ncognition processes involved in clinical decision-making. More\ncomprehensive theories of cognition, such as the transtheoretical\nmodel, while including the DPT, also incorporate additional layers\nsuch as embodied cognition through sensory input or situated cog-\nnition representing the interactions between individuals and their\nenvironment. These additional layers provide a more holistic view of\nclinical reasoning, acknowledging the complex interplay between\ninternal cognitive processes and external factors. When applying\nthese theories to LLMs, we encounter signiﬁcant limitations. Con-\nsidering LLMs have restricted access to external cognitive processes,\nwe argue that internal cognition processes from the DPT must\ncompensate. This compensation, however, may not fully replicate\nthe richness of human clinical reasoning. Our work investigates\nSystem 1 thinking exclusively, which involves rapid, intuitive\ndecision-making. While additional experiments involving System\n2 should be conducted to improve our understanding of LLM cog-\nnition, it’s important to note that studies have shown that switching\nto System 2 may not always reduce reasoning errors in humans\n43.\nLLMs also appear to suffer from a similar shortcoming and fail to self-\ncorrect when their reasoning is faulty44. Therefore, investigating\nSystem 1 exclusively appears to be an important initial step towards\nunderstanding the limitations in cognitive capabilities for clinical\ndecision-making of LLMs. Future research could explore ways to\nincorporate aspects of System 2 thinking and elements of the\ntranstheoretical model into LLM-based clinical decision support\nsystems, potentially bridging the gap between current LLM cap-\nabilities and the complex, multifaceted nature of human clinical\nreasoning.\nIn conclusion, these results suggest that current LLMs, despite\nhigh accuracy on certain tasks, lack essential capabilities for safe\ndeployment in clinical settings. The discrepancy between performance\non standard questions and metacognitive tasks highlights a critical\narea for improvement in LLM development. This gap raises concerns\nabout a form of deceptive expertise, where systems appear knowl-\nedgeable but fail to recognize their own limitations. Future research\nshould focus on enhancing LLMs’ability to recognize uncertainty and\nknowledge gaps, as well as developing robust evaluation metrics that\nbetter reﬂect the complexities of clinical reasoning.\nMethods\nBenchmark procedure\nWe used Python 3.12 and Guidance, a Python library designed to\nenforce model adherence to speciﬁc instructions through constrained\ndecoding45, ensuring the models selected only from the allowed\nchoices (A/B/C/D/E/F) and provided conﬁdence scores (1/2/3/4/5)46.\nWe included both proprietary and open-weight models in our\nevaluation. For proprietary models, we tested OpenAI’s GPT-4o-2024-\n05-1347 and GPT-3.5-turbo-012548. For open-weight models, we selected\nthe most popular foundational models from the HuggingFace trending\ntext generation model list as of June 2024, including Mixtral-8x7B-\nv0.1\n49, Mistral-7B-v0.150, Yi-1.5-9B, Yi-1.5-34B51, Meta-Llama-3-8B, Meta-\nLlama-3-70B52, Qwen2-7B, and Qwen2-72B53. In addition, we evaluated\ntwo medical models based on Mistral-7B-v0.1, namely meerkat-7b-\nv1.0\n54 and internistai/base-7b-v0.255, to determine if additional medical\ntraining enhances metacognitive abilities. All models were evaluated\nwith a temperature setting of 0 to ensure reliability and reproducibility\nof results\n56. The open-weight model evaluations were performed on a\nMicrosoft Azure Virtual Machine with 4 NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs and\nrequired a total runtime of 3 hours, including setup time.\nThe 95% conﬁdence interval is derived from the standard error of\nthe mean multiplied by 1.96.
