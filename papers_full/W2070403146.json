INTRODUCTION \n \n Ozone gas (O 3) is one of the strongest oxidizing and \nbleaching agents. It is used in many sectors such as \nagriculture, water supply, waste treatment and \npharmaceuticals [ 1]-[3]. O 3 is generated naturally in the \nenvironment by lightening or ultra violet (UV) radiation. \nElectrically, it can be produced by applying a high potential \nbetween two electrodes in an air or oxygen gas chamber, one \nof which is covered with a thin dielectric material. The space \nbetween electrodes, where the gas flows is called the  \ndischarge gap. This method of producing O\n3 is known in the \nliterature as corona discharge, atmospheric pressure glow \ndischarge or dielectric barrier discharge (DBD). The latter, \nwhich is commonly referred to as silent discharge, has been \nproven to be the best method for ozone generation [4]. \nCurrently\n, the main focus of most researcher is to obtain a \nhigh ozone yield using a minimum of energy. One possibility \nway to increase efficiency is to use a high frequency power \nsupply to drive the ozone chamber. By increasing the \nfrequency, the power density applied to the electrode surface \nis increased, allowing for a decrease in the applied electrode \nvoltage. Due to the bombardment of electrons, the current \nflows through the discharge gap by means of millions of \nmicro-discharge channels. High frequency operation tends to \nreignite the previously used micro-discharge channels and as \na result the ozone yield is increased [5]. \nManuscript received Mar. 14, 2011; revised Jan. 31, 2012 \nRecommended for publication by Associate Editor Yong-Chae Jung. \n†Corresponding Author: zainals@fke.utm.my  \nTel: +607-5536187, Fax: +607-5566272, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia \n*Dept. of Energy Conversion, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, \nUniversiti Teknologi Malaysia, Malaysia. \n**University College of Engineering and Technology, The Islamia\nUniversity of Bahawalpur, Pakistan  \nA ty\npical ozone power supply consists of an inverter, \ncoupled with a high turns-ratio transformer. In [ 6]-[8], a \nsingle switch c\nlass-E resonant inverter to supply the ozone \nchamber was presented. The main disadvantage of this \ntopology is the high crest factor current that flows through the \n3 8 8                           Journal of Power Electronics, Vol. 12, No. 3, May 2012 \n \nswitch, resulting in poor switch utilization. The switch turns \non at a nonzero voltage and its output capacitance is not \nintegrated in the resonance circuit. Furthermore, the voltage \nacross the ozone chamber is not sinusoidal. The efficiency of \nthe power stage is approximately 50% − thus limiting its \napplication in the low power range.  In [ 9], a similar \ntopology\n was proposed but with an LC  resonant tank placed \nat the secondary side of the transformer. The drawback of this \ncircuit is the high voltage and current stresses in the switch. \nWith the inclusion of an LC tank, its efficiency was increased \nbut ZCZVS could not be achieved.  \n \nFig. 1.  Circuit diagram of the proposed ozone generator. \nFor \nmultiple switch topologies, voltage-fed full bridge \nresonant inverters are the most popular [ 10]-[13]. In these \ncircuits, the in\nductance is placed at the secondary of the \ntransformer to stabilize the discharge. In [ 14]-[17], a full \nbridge inverter \nusing a resonant inductor at the primary side \nis used to reduce the tuned resonant frequency. For both cases, \nthe presence of the inductor increases the complexity of the \ncircuit and reduces its efficiency. Ozone power supplies using \ncurrent fed push-pull inverters are implemented in [ 4], \n[18]-[22]. However, the two inductors used as a choke are \nlarge, resulting in reduced efficiency\n.  \nAll of the above-mentioned topologies used a high voltage \ntransformer to achieve a high voltage for ozone generation. \nThese transformers have high leakage inductances that cannot \nbe integrated into the resonant tank because they have no path \nfor flux discharge. Furthermore, high voltage spikes occur \ndue to the leakage inductance, which greatly affect the \ncommutation of the power switches. The transformer exhibits \nseveral other disadvantages, namely a limited frequency \nrange of operation due to core saturation, a large size, a high \nparasitic capacitance and a low efficiency. Moreover, the \ncapacitance of the ozone chamber is magnified by the step-up \nturn ratio of the transformer. As a result, it presents a high \nequivalent capacitance as seen from the input side. To \nalleviate these problems, an ozone power supply based on a \npiezoelectric transformer (PT) was proposed [ 23]. Although \npro\nmising, the resonance bell of the PT is very narrow. As a \nresult, the closed loop is difficult to control. PTs are very \nexpensive and high power PT are not commonly available in \nthe market. \nTraditionally, borosilicate glass or ceramic is used as a \ndielectric material for the ozone chamber. For these materials, \na peak voltage in the vicinity of 10 kV is required to initiate \nan electrical discharge for a 1 mm discharge gap. Recently, \nthe use of mica as dielectric material has been proposed [ 24], \n[25]. Using this material, the initiation voltage (for natural \nair) for discharge is only\n around 1.5 kV p-p. The lower \nbreakdown voltage of the mica provides an opportunity to \nexperiment with new topologies for the power converters. \nHence in this study, a transformer-less topology is \nconsidered.  \nThe objective of this paper is to describe the design, \ndevelopment, and analysis of a high-voltage transformer-less \npower supply for ozone generation. The required voltage gain \nis achieved using a resonance technique. No additional \nreactive element is required apart from the resonant tank. \nOther advantages of this topology include reduced cost, \nsimpler design and increased reliability. Furthermore, the \ntopology offers ZCZVS. The soft switching reduces losses \nand minimizes electromagnetic interference. Another benefit \nis the integration of the output capacitance of the power \nswitches in the resonant circuit [ 20]. The soft switching is \ni\nmplemented using a class D-E inverter control. In theory, the \nefficiency could reach 100% [26], [ 27].  \nThis paper i\ns organized as follows: Section II outlines the \noverall proposed system and the ozone generator. Section III \ndescribes the analysis of the resonant tank and the ozone \ngenerator. The circuit operation is given in Section IV. \nSections V and VI show the design and the implementation, \nrespectively. Simulation and experimental results obtained \nfrom a prototype are given in section VII. Finally, the paper \nis summarized with conclusions in section VIII. \n    \nII. OVERALL PROPOSED OZONE GENERATION \nSYSTEM \n \nThe proposed ozone generator system is shown in Fig. 1. It \nconsists of a high frequency PWM full bridge inverter, a \nresonant tank and an ozone chamber. The latter is modeled \nusing a R-C in parallel. \n \nA. PWM Full Bridge Inverter \nIn the full bridge inverter, the MOSFETs M1, M3 and M2, M4 \nare switched in anti-phase to provide a quasi square wave as an \ninput to the resonant tank. The switches are equipped with \nfreewheeling diodes.  \n \nB. Resonant Tank \nThe resonant tank consists of a series Ls ̶ Cp circuit connected \nbetween the inverter and the ozone chamber. The high \nfrequency square wave signal voltage multiplication is \nachieved by using the resonance. The resonant tank will also \nact as a filter. As a result, a sinusoidal voltage will appear \nacross the chamber. \n         Design and Development of a High-Voltage Transformer-less Power Supply for ...                  389 \n \n \n \nFig. 4.  Experimental setup to determine the ozone chamber \nparameters. \nC. Ozone Chamber \nThe ozone chamber basically consists of two electrodes \nseparated by a dielectric material. It behaves mainly like \ncapacitive load [4]. The chamber used in this work is shown in \nFig. 2. \nIt consists of two aluminum mesh electrodes (outer side \ncovered with copper tape) having a 120 mm length and a 70 \nmm width. One electrode is covered with muscovite mica \nhaving a 0.1 mm thickness. The discharge gap between \nelectrodes is 1mm [24]. \nIn [ 28], a high frequency model of the ozone chamber is \npre\nsented by a parallel combination of gC  and gR . The \ncomplete model for the proposed ozone chamber is shown in \nFig. 3. This simplified model is a linear one, in which gC  \nand gR are very easy to estimate. To obtain the values of gC   \nand gR , v ge charge ( V-Q) and voltage-current ( V-I) \nLissajous figures are used. \nolta\n  \n \nThe experimental setup to determine the chamber \nparameters is shown in Fig. 4. The chamber capacitance gC  \nis calculated using: \n \nmax\n(0ch ch\ng\nivC V\n)                  ( 1 )  \n \nwhere the values of  and  can be obtained from \nV-I Lissaj\nous figure.

The equivalent circuits for each of the \noperating modes are shown in Fig. 8. An adequate duty factor \nis employed between the switches operation so that the reactive \nenergy stored in the snubber capacitors and intrinsic capacitors \nof the switches can be handled without a loss of efficiency. In \norder to achieve ZCZVS operation, a switching frequency must \nbe selected that is greater than ω\nr. The circuit operation can be \ndivided into six modes as follows. \nMode 1 (t0 ̶ t1): During this mode M1 and M3 turn ON and the \nDC power supply provides energy to the load. This mode is \ncalled the rectifying mode. The current flows from the supply \nto the load via switches M\n1 and M3 and the voltage VAB is +VCC. \nThe voltages across M1, M3, C1, C3, D1 and D3 are zero, and the \nvoltages across M2, M 4, C 2, C 4, D 2 and D4 are +VCC.

Current flows via D2, \nD4 and the load, back to the supply. The voltages across M2, M4, \nC2, C4, D2 and D4 are zero, and the voltages across M1, M3, C1, \nC2, D1 and D3 are +VCC. The voltage VAB is –VCC. \nMode 4 (t3 ̶ t4): In this mode, M2 and M4 turn ON and the DC \npower supply provides energy to the load. This mode is also \ncalled the rectifying mode. The current flows from the DC \npower supply to the load via switches M2 and M4 and the \nvoltage VAB is –VCC. The voltages across M1, M3, C1, C3, D1 and \nD3 are +VCC and the voltages across M2, M4, C2, C4, D2 and D4 \nare zero.

Resonant tank \nThe resonant tank circuit Ls ̶ Cp is designed at unity power \nfactor. This operating point frequency is called the resonant \nfrequency, where the voltage, current and losses are at their \nmaximum.

Control Circuit \nA circuit diagram of the control circuit is shown in Fig. 9.  \nIt provides the gate drive signals for the IRFP460 MOSFETs \nM\n1–M4 in Fig. 1. The gate drive signals are generated by \nregulating the pulse width modulator (PWM) IC LM3524D. \nThe frequency of the drive signal can be calculated by the \nvoltage controlled oscillator (VCO), which can be determined \nby the values of R  and C connected at the pins R\nt and Ct. The \noutputs of the LM3524D are two NPN transistors, driven 1800 \nout of phase. Each output of the PWM IC is used to drive two \ninputs of the SN7407 buffer. The duty cycle of the outputs can \nbe varied by the voltage applied at the COMP pin of the PWM \nIC.  \nThe outputs of the buffers are used to drive the four \nHCPL-3120 opto-couplers. The outputs of the opto-couplers \nprovide the gating signal for the full bridge inverter. \n \nB. Resonant Inductor \nThe desired value of LS, obtained from (23) is 35.78 mH. \nThe inductor maximum voltage is 3.5 kV p at the resonance \nfrequency. The rms current IL, rms  from (26) is 0.35A. The \nresonant inductor is implemented by placing isolation \nbetween two layers of the turns as shown in Fig. 10.  \nThe L\nS is designed by the area product ( AP), approach. The \nformula for AP, [33] is given by (30) as: \n \n \n421\np\nmu\nEnergyA JK 0\n            ( 3 0 )  \n2\n2\npkLIEnergy                ( 3 1 )  \n \nwhere Bm is the operating flux density, J is the current density, \nKu is the window utilization factor and I pk is the peak current \nof the inductor.  \nAccording to the design an ETD54 3C90 ferrite core is \nused to build the resonant inductor. \n \nC. Resonant Capacitor \nThe desired value of C P, obtained from (24), is 543 pF. \nSince the voltage across the resonant capacitor is 3.5 kVp, it is \nimplemented by a series-parallel connection of \nmedium-voltage capacitors. Four film polypropylene \ncapacitors of 1500 pF nominal capacitance and 700 Vrms are \nconnected in series, which results an equivalent capacitance \nof 375 pF.

SIMULATION AND EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS \nA prototype has been implemented and tested using the \nabove calculated values. Furthermore, the circuit is simulated \nin MATLAB/SIMULINK. The resonant frequency is set to \n29.5 kHz. The voltage gain at the resonant frequency is 45. \nThe switching frequency of the inverter is selected at 30 kHz, \nwhich is above the resonant frequency. This is done to \nachieve the ZCZVS condition. The switching frequency is \nkept constant, while the voltage of the ozone chamber is \nvaried by varying the input voltage. The input voltage of the \ninverter is varied between 25V and 35V. \nFig. 11 illustrates the current and voltage waveforms at the \ninput of the resonant tank. The operation is performed above \nthe resonance and the resonant tank represents an inductive \nload to the inverter. As can be seen, the current lags the \nvoltage.   \nFig. 12 shows the switching signals of the MOSFETs \ntogether with the output current of the inverter. As can be \nseen, the power switches turn on at zero current. As a result, \nthe turn on switching loss is zero. However, there are turn off \nlosses in the power switches. As explained in section IV, in \nmode 2, at 25% of the duty cycle, the switches M\n1 and M 3 \nturn off. This starts the commutation process. The inverter \noutput current discharges C\n2 and C3 while charging C1 and C4. \nWhen the voltages across C1 and C 4 reach VCC, the voltages \nacross C2 and C3 becomes zero. \nFig. 11. \n Input voltage and current waveforms of the resonant \ntank (a) Simulation (b) Experimental. \n         Design and Development of a High-Voltage Transformer-less Power Supply for ...                  395 \n \n \n(a) Simulation. \n \n \n(b) Experimental. \n \nFig. 13.

Variation of ozone quantity with i nput voltage of \ninverter. \nFig. 13 shows the switching signals and the voltage across \nthe switches. As can be seen, when power switches  turn on, \nthe voltage across each switch falls to zero. Consequently, no \nhigh voltage spikes occur during the turn off process. The \nmaximum voltage that appears across power switches is equal \nto the inverter input voltage. Typically, high voltage spikes \noccur during turn off due to the leakage inductance of the \ntransformer [20].  \nFig. 14 illustrates the voltage and current wav\neforms of the \nozone chamber. Clearly, the voltage and current waveforms \nare sinusoidal. The current leads the voltage because the \nswitching frequency is fixed and the ozone generator behaves \nas a capacitive load. The effect of micro-discharges can be \nseen in the current waveforms. By increasing the voltage, the \namplitude and duration of the micro-discharges increase in \nboth cycles of the current waveform. As a result the ozone \nproduction increases.  \nIn general, the simulation and experimental results are in \ngood agreement, which confirms that the proposed model \nparameters are valid.  \nFig. 15 shows the variation of the ozone quantity (mgO\n3/ \nWhr) with respect to the inverter input voltage. The ozone \ngenerator was fed with a 95% oxygen flow of 1 L/min. As \ncan be seen, by increasing the input voltage, the ozone \nproduction increases. The input power is about 3.6 to 7 watts.  \nThe maximum ozone output is 20 mgO\n3/Whr. This ozone \nquantity is higher than the low power atmospheric pressure \nozone generators reported in [8], [34].   \nFig. 16 shows the overall efficiency\n of the inverter. To \nensure the accuracy of the measured voltage and current, a \nhigh accuracy, high bandwidth LeCroy 600MHz oscilloscope \nis used. The maximum inverter efficiency is about 86%. \nA comparison of efficiency of the proposed \ntransformer-less power supply with that of other transformer \nbased supplies is shown in Fig. 17. This comparison indicates \nthat the efficiency of the transformer-less power supply is \ngreater than that of a ferrite core based transformer. However, \nit is less than that of a PT-based power supply. This is to be \nexpected due to the non-winding nature of the PT. Despite \nthis fact, the PT has several limitations as described in the \nintroduction section. \n \n \nVIII. CONCLUSION \nIn this paper, the development of an ozone generator \nwithout a transformer has been investigated. The advantages \nof the proposed system are its high efficiency, smaller \nfootprint and lower cost. The voltage step-up is achieved only \nby an L\ns ̶ C p resonant tank. By using muscovite mica as a \ndielectric material, ozone can be generated at about 1.5 −3.5 \nkVp-p. Furthermore, ZCZVS operation is achieved by \nemploying a 25% duty factor between the MOSFETs of the \ninverter bridge. To validate the viability of the proposed \nsystem, a prototype ozone generator is constructed. The \n         Design and Development of a High-Voltage Transformer-less Power Supply for ...                  397 \n \nsimulation and experimental results are found to be in close \nagreement with the theoretical predictions.  \n \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \n \nThe authors would like to thank the Universiti Teknologi \nMalaysia for providing the facilities and research grant to \nconduct this research through vot.
