Introduction\nRecently, a solid-state transformer for medium-voltage ap-\nplications has been discussed for use in next-generation elec-\ntrical grids such as smart grids (1) (2). A typical candidate for\nthe solid-state transformer is an isolated DC-DC converter\n(dual active bridge) with a medium-frequency (MF) trans-\nformer; high-power isolated DC-DC converters have been\nproposed\n(3)–(6). Isolated DC-DC converters for railway ap-\nplications and power distribution systems have been dis-\ncussed\n(7). Furthermore, a DC-DC converter with a voltage\nof 2.5 kV and a transmission power of 200 kW has been de-\nveloped\n(8).\nTo realize a high-power isolated DC-DC converter, a re-\nduction in volume and higher eﬃciency of the magnetic com-\nponents, especially the MF transformer and inductors, are\nneeded because these components dominate the volume in\nDC-DC converters. However, a reduction in volume results\nin higher powers and higher loss densities in the transformer,\nwhich may cause serious problems such as thermal limita-\ntions in the magnetic core. Because of the thermal limitation,\nit is necessary to calculate the iron losses for the MF trans-\nformer and inductors. The total loss and isolation materials of\nthe MF transformer for the DC-DC converters have been dis-\ncussed in many papers\n(9) (10). However, no analysis procedure\nfor the iron loss depending on the circuit operation of the MF\ntransformer and the inductors has ever been presented. The\noperation frequency of the solid-state transformer is normally\nset to over 10 kHz. The voltage waveform is not sinusoidal,\nbut rectangular; the excited voltage waveform depends on the\ncircuit operation. As a result, a conventional iron loss analy-\nsis procedure based on the loss data supplied by the datasheet\n∗Tokyo Metropolitan University\n1-1, Minamiosawa, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-0397, Japan\nfor a sinusoidal waveform does not apply to the magnetic\ncomponents of the DC-DC converter. Therefore, an analy-\nsis procedure for the iron losses in the magnetic components\nin a solid-state transformer should be developed. To design\nthe MF transformer, iron loss analysis methods, which show\nthe iron loss characteristics under the actual operating condi-\ntions of the DC-DC converter, are presented in this paper. In\naddition, the authors present an iron loss separation method\nthat divides the iron loss into the hysteresis loss and the eddy-\ncurrent loss. If these two components of the iron loss are\nmade clear, a suitable core shape or material for a DC-DC\nconverter will be proposed. Speciﬁcally, the initial design of\nthe core, such as material, thickness, and structure, depends\non the sinusoidal voltage excitations. However, the excited\nvoltage waveform of the DC-DC converter depends on the\noperation conditions; thus, the iron loss calculation and its\nseparation should be discussed.\nIn this paper, a simple method for iron loss calculation,\nbased on the iGSE and specialized to evaluate the isolated\nDC-DC converter, is shown. In Ref. (11), an iron loss analy-\nsis method called i\n2GSE is proposed. This method, based on\nthe Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, can calculate the iron\nloss under rectangular excitation more accurately than iGSE.\nHowever, to calculate the iron loss of the MF transformer\nused in the DC-DC converter by i\n2GSE, the actual magnetiz-\ning voltage waveform is needed. In this research, a simple\nanalysis method for the iron loss is considered. Therefore,\nthe simpler method, iGSE, is used for the iron loss.\nTo analyze the iron loss in detail, this paper proposes an\niron loss calculation method that can divide the iron loss into\nhysteresis loss and eddy-current loss. Moreover, the total loss\nanalysis of the magnetic components including the inductor\nin the isolated DC-DC converter is also presented.\nTo conﬁrm the validity of these analysis methods, ana-\nlytical and experimental results will be presented.

Iron Loss Calculation Methods for Isolated\nDC-DC Converter\n2.1 Circuit Conﬁguration Figure 1 shows the ex-\nperimental DC-DC converter circuit. It transmits electrical\npower from the primary side to the secondary side via the\nMF transformer and the inductors; the transmitted power is\nregenerated from the secondary side to the primary side. Us-\ning this conﬁguration, the DC supply can be made as small as\npossible, because the DC voltage source only has to supply\nthe dissipated power in the entire circuit\n(6). To transmit the\npower, the phase di ﬀerence δbetween v1 and v2 is needed.\nThe period of δis deﬁned as Tδ s h o w ni nF i g . 2a n di se x -\npressed as follows:\nTδ=T ×δ[rad]\n2π ,································· (1)\nwhere T is the cycle of the operation.

Table 1 shows the\nspeciﬁcations of the magnetic cores used in the experiments.\nFurther, to decrease the leakage inductance, a biﬁlar-wound\nstructure is adopted.\nFor the two inductors, L/2, shown in Fig. 1, the iron alloy\nFig. 3. Waveforms of the isolated DC-DC converter\ndust cores (HK-36D), which are toroidal cores, are used. To\nprevent magnetic saturation, four toroidal cores are used for\neach inductor.\nIn this research, the rated DC voltage is set to 150 V and\nthe transmitted power is 2.7 kW. The switching frequency of\nthe IGBTs is set to 10 kHz. The experimental waveforms of\nthe DC-DC converter are shown in Fig. 3.\n2.2 Calculation Method using iGSE\n2.2.1 Iron Loss in an MF Transformer The im-\nproved generalized Steinmetz equation (iGSE) (12) is a well-\nknown iron loss calculation method for alternative excitation\nconditions.

There are four operation modes as shown in I to IV\nin Fig. 4.\nIn modes I and III, the ﬂux density B is constant, because\nthe excited voltage of the transformer is zero. According to\niGSE, as shown in (3), iron loss occurs when the ﬂux density\n388 IEEJ Journal IA, Vol.4, No.4, 2015\nLoss Analysis of Magnetic ComponentsʢMizuki Nakahara et al.ʣ\nFig. 4.

Therefore, the iron loss is zero in modes I and\nIII.\nIn the case of mode II and IV , the ﬂux density is chang-\ning, because the voltage E is applied to the MF transformer.\nAccording to Faraday’s law,\n⏐⏐⏐dB\ndt\n⏐⏐⏐can be expressed as follows:\n⏐⏐\n⏐⏐\ndB\ndt\n⏐⏐\n⏐⏐= E\nNS ····································· (5)\nwhere N is the number of the windings of the MF trans-\nformer, and S is the cross-sectional area of the core.

Ad-\nditionally, Bmax has a δdependency; even if α=1, the iron\nloss does not become 0.\n2.2.2 Iron Loss in Inductors The iron loss in the in-\nductors in the DC-DC converter can be obtained by the same\nprocedure as used for the MF transformer.

Figure 5 shows\nthe measurement circuit in the B-H analyzer. In this circuit,\nthe B-H analyzer measures the waveforms of i\nL and v2m,a n d\nthus, the B-H curve of the magnetic core can be drawn.\nThe procedure for obtaining Steinmetz constants in the\ncase of using the amorphous core is presented below.\nFirst, the iron losses are measured while changing the fre-\nquency of voltage v1m for a ﬁxed maximum ﬂux density. In\nthis measurement, the frequency ranges from 1 to 10 kHz,\nwith increments of 1 kHz. Therefore, there are 10 measure-\nment points.\nSecond, the same measurements are repeated with di ﬀer-\nent maximum ﬂux density values. In this measurement, the\nmaximum ﬂux density ranges from 0.06 to 0.30 T, with incre-\nments of 0.02 T. Therefore, there are 13 measurement points.\nAs a result, there are 10 ×13 =130 measurement points.\nThe core temperature for each measurement was set to room\ntemperature (23–25\n◦C). In this temperature region, the iron\nloss does not signiﬁcantly change, as described in Sect. 5.\nThe iron loss data measured using the above procedure is\ninputted into MATLAB for numerical calculation. In MAT-\nLAB, the measured data are 3D curve ﬁtted with the 3D curve\nﬁtting tool; Figs. 13 and 14 show the results of this 3D curve\nﬁtting. In Figs. 13 and 14, there are 130 points shown as the\nblack dots.\nThe results of the 3D curve ﬁtting produce the Steinmetz\nconstants.\n2.3 Calculation Results Table 3 shows the calculated\nSteinmetz constants in the two cores of the MF transformer\nand the HK-36D values for the inductors.

From Fig. 6, the iron losses in the MF transformer and\nthe inductors versus the phase diﬀerence δcan be presented.\n3. Iron Loss Separation into Hysteresis Loss and\nEddy-Current Loss\nThe iron loss separation into hysteresis loss and other\nlosses has previously been presented for the case of using\nan inductor for switching ripple reduction ﬁlters under the\nDC excitation condition\n(13). However, the ratios of hysteresis\nloss and eddy-current loss to the total iron losses of the MF\ntransformer are unclear.\nGenerally, to analyze the iron losses of a transformer un-\nder sinusoidal excitation, a separation equation for hysteresis\nloss and eddy-current loss is used\n(14):\nPiron =σh fB max\n2 +σe f 2 Bmax\n2 [W/m3]········· (11)\nwhere σh and σe are the iron loss parameters, which indi-\ncate the magnitude of each iron loss factor; these parameters\ndepend on the material and the core shape. These parame-\nters can be calculated from the iron loss data measured with\nthe B-H analyzer under sinusoidal excitation. The ﬁrst part\nof the equation represents the hysteresis loss and the second\npart represents the eddy-current loss.\nUnder rectangular excitation, the voltage waveform con-\ntains signiﬁcant harmonic components; therefore, the above\nequation cannot be applied and additional parameters for the\nexponents are used, which is similar to the case of the Stein-\nmetz equation. The Steinmetz equation is based on measure-\nment results; the proposed method is also based on measure-\nments because the voltage has many harmonic components.\nTherefore, as shown in the following equation, the exponents\nare replaced by constants ( γ, λ\n1,a n d λ2), which depend on\nthe core materials and their shapes.\nPiron =σh fB max\nλ1 +σe f γBmax\nλ2 [W/m3]······· (12)\nwhere γ, λ1,a n dλ2 are the exponents for the frequency and\nmaximum ﬂux density.\nTo calculate the ﬁve iron loss parameters, a B-H analyzer\nand MATLAB are used. Loss measurements are performed\nwith the B-H analyzer, and the iron loss parameters are ob-\ntained by a curve ﬁtting tool in MATLAB.\nThe calculation procedure is almost the same as that for\nthe Steinmetz constants. In the case of calculating the iron\nloss using Steinmetz constants, the B-H analyzer is used for\nsinusoidal excitation. However, in the case of calculating the\niron loss using (12), the B-H analyzer is used for rectangular\nexcitation with a duty ratio of 50%.\n3.1 Correction for Eddy-Current Loss Term The\nexcitation voltage waveform to the transformer in the DC-DC\nconverter is rectangular. When δis set to zero, the duty ratio\nFig. 7. Waveform of voltage E for δ=0\nFig. 8. Waveform of voltage E for δ/nequal0\nFig. 9. Waveform of ﬂux density B for δ/nequal0\nFig. 10. Uncorrected waveform of ﬂux density B\nof the excitation waveform is 50%, and the waveform of the\nﬂux density is triangular. On the other hand, whenδis not set\nto zero, the duty ratio of the excitation waveform is less than\n50%, and the waveform of the ﬂux density is trapezoidal, as\nshown in Fig. 4. Therefore, because the waveforms of the ﬂux\ndensity are diﬀerent (because of the operation conditions of\nthe DC-DC converter), (12) cannot be applied when δ/nequal0\n◦.\nTherefore, (12) should be corrected in the iron loss analysis\nwhen δ/nequal0\n◦. The excitation waveform for δ=0◦is shown in\nFig. 7, and that for δ/nequal0◦is shown in Fig. 8. Figure 9 shows\nthe waveform of the ﬂux density for δ/nequal0◦.\nIn this paper, to more easily calculate the iron loss, a cor-\nrection coeﬃcient is added to only the eddy-current loss term.\nThis coeﬃcient is\n(\n1 −δ\nπ\n)1−γ\n. Therefore, (12) is rewritten as\n(13).\nPiron =σh fB max\nλ1 +σe\n(\n1 −δ\nπ\n)1−γ\nf γBmax\nλ2 ······ (13)\nThe added coe ﬃcient changes its value depending on δ.\nMoreover, Bmax also has a δdependency, as shown in (7).\nTherefore, both the hysteresis loss and the eddy-current loss\nare dependent on δ.\n3.2 Discussion of the Correction Coe ﬃcient In\n(13), the hysteresis loss term is not corrected. The hysteresis\nloss is deﬁned as the area of the B-H loop, which is propor-\ntional to the frequency f . Therefore, the hysteresis loss does\nnot depend on the rate of change of the ﬂux densitydB/dt.I n\nother words, the hysteresis loss term does not require correc-\ntion.\nOn the other hand, the eddy-current loss depends ondB/dt.\nFrom Fig. 10, because dB/dt for δ/nequal0\n◦is diﬀerent from that\nfor δ=0◦, a correction for dB/dt is needed. The dB/dt ratio\n390 IEEJ Journal IA, Vol.4, No.4, 2015\nLoss Analysis of Magnetic ComponentsʢMizuki Nakahara et al.ʣ\nFig. 11. Incompletely corrected waveform of ﬂux den-\nsity B\nFig. 12.

The correction\nbased on dB/dt can be performed by multiplying f by this\nratio. However, the frequency of the corrected waveform of\nB, shown as a broken line in Fig. 11, is higher than the actual\nfrequency. Because the eddy-current loss occurs when the\nﬂux density B is changing, if the change inB is not corrected,\nthe extra loss will be introduced in the calculation. Therefore,\nthe loss should be corrected. The ratio of the loss can be also\ncalculated as\n(\n1−δ\nπ\n)\n. Therefore, by dividing the eddy-current\nloss term by the ratio, the loss can be corrected, as shown in\nFig. 12. As a result, the corrected equation (13) is obtained.\nEquation (13) separates the iron loss into the hysteresis loss\nand eddy-current loss; this is a specialized equation for the\nMF transformer used in the isolated DC-DC converter.\n3.3 Calculation Procedure for Iron Loss Parameters\nThe parameters in (13), including γ, λ1, λ2, σh,a n d σe,\nmust be obtained for the measurements using the B-H an-\nalyzer because these parameters depend on the core shape\nand core material. The measurement procedure, range of fre-\nquency, and maximum ﬂux density are the same as those used\nto derive the Steinmetz constants shown in 2.2.3. The pa-\nrameters, γ, λ\n1, λ2, σh,a n d σe, can be calculated using the\nabove-mentioned procedure.\nThe calculated results are shown in Table 4. From Table 4,\nthe γvalue of the amorphous core is larger than that of the\nsilicon steel core. The σe value of the silicon steel, which\nshows the magnitude of the eddy-current loss, is 14 times\nlarger than that of the amorphous core.\nThe thickness of one sheet in the amorphous core is\n0.025 mm, and that in the silicon steel core is 0.1 mm. Gen-\nerally, the eddy-current loss becomes larger as the thickness\nof the sheets of the laminated core become large. Therefore,\nthe eddy-current loss of the silicon steel core is expected to\nbe larger than that of the amorphous core.\n3.4 Separation Results with Proposed Method The\nhysteresis loss and eddy-current loss under the actual opera-\ntion region of the DC-DC converter can be calculated using\nFig. 13.

Separated iron losses (hysteresis and eddy-\ncurrent) for amorphous core\nFig. 16. Separated iron losses (hysteresis and eddy-\ncurrent) for silicon steel core\nthe parameters shown in Table 4 and (13). In the case of\nchanging the δvalue for the DC-DC converter, Figs. 15 and\n16 show the analysis results of the hysteresis loss and eddy-\ncurrent loss. In the case of the amorphous core (Fig. 15), the\nhysteresis loss is almost equivalent to the eddy-current loss\nover the entire range of δvalues. On the other hand, in the\ncase of silicon steel (Fig. 16), the eddy-current loss is signif-\nicantly larger than the hysteresis loss over the entire range\nof δ. The eddy-current loss in silicon steel core is ﬁve times\n391 IEEJ Journal IA, Vol.4, No.4, 2015\nLoss Analysis of Magnetic ComponentsʢMizuki Nakahara et al.ʣ\nlarger than that in the amorphous core. This di ﬀerence is\ncaused by the di ﬀerence in both the thickness of the lami-\nnated core and the resistivity of its material as shown in Ta-\nble 1.\n4. Total Loss Analysis of the MF Transformer\nand the Inductors\nTo design the MF transformer and inductors for the DC-\nDC converter, the total loss of these magnetic components,\nincluding the copper loss, should be known, because the mag-\nnetic components dominate the volume of the DC-DC con-\nverter. Therefore, if the total loss is known for the various\noperation conditions of the DC-DC converter, a design that\noptimally reduces the losses of the magnetic components can\nbe created.\n4.1 Calculation of the Copper Loss The total loss in\nthe MF transformer and the inductors is primarily due to iron\nloss and copper loss. Therefore, to analyze the total losses in\nthe magnetic components, copper loss analysis is needed.\nThe copper loss P\ncop is expressed by the following equa-\ntion:\nPcop =(Rw1 +Rw2)I2\nRMS ,························ (15)\nwhere IRMS is the RMS value of the current that ﬂows into\nthe windings, and Rw1 and Rw2 are the winding resistances of\nthe primary and secondary sides, respectively, of the DC-DC\nconverter of the experimental system. These winding resis-\ntances include the winding resistances of the inductor and the\nMF transformer.\nTo calculate the copper loss, the RMS value of the cur-\nrent that ﬂows into the windings must be obtained. In this\nresearch, the current is calculated using the following equa-\ntion:\nI\nRMS =Eδ\nωL\n√\n1 −2δ\n3π·························· (16)\nIn (16), the excitation current of the MF transformer is ig-\nnored because its value is much smaller than IRMS .\nTo calculate the copper loss, the winding resistances must\nbe obtained beforehand. In this research, a resistance meter\n(RM3548, HIOKI) is used. Although the resistance meter\ncan measure only the DC resistance, the measurement results\nare used for the copper loss analysis under 10 kHz because\nlitz wire (φ0.1 mm ×686), which can reduce the skin eﬀect,\nis used for the windings.\nThe measurement results are shown as follows,\nR\nw1 =19.8m Ω································· (17)\nRw2 =19.7m Ω································· (18)\n4.2 Analysis Result for the Total Loss The analysis\nresult of the total loss in the magnetic components is shown\nin Fig. 17. The amorphous steel core is used for the MF trans-\nformer. An HK-36D core is used for the inductors.\nFrom the results, the total losses from the magnetic com-\nponents depend on the phase di ﬀerence δ. Therefore, using\nthis analysis method, a minimal-loss design of the magnetic\ncomponents can be created.\nIn the case of the example shown in Fig. 17, the total loss\nhas its minimum at δ=6\n◦.\nFig. 17. Total loss calculation result of the magnetic\ncomponents\n5. Experimental Results\nThis section presents the experimental results based on the\nmethods proposed in this paper. The e ﬀects of the core tem-\nperature on the iron loss were reported in (16). From the mea-\nsurement results in (16) for experiments performed at room\ntemperature, the iron losses did not changed.\n5.1 Experimental Conﬁguration To conﬁrm the va-\nlidity of the loss analysis methods developed in this pa-\nper, an experimental conﬁguration was designed and imple-\nmented, as shown in Fig. 1. In this circuit, the power analyzer\n(PZ4000, YOKOGAW A) is used to measure the loss due to\nthe magnetic components. The iron loss P\niron and copper loss\nof the windingsPcop can be obtained by subtracting the power\nof the secondary side from that of the primary side. In this\nsystem, the iron loss P\niron can be separated from the copper\nloss Pcop , because Pcop can be calculated by measuring the\nwinding resistance beforehand.\nThe experimental conditions are shown in Table 2. These\nconditions are decided based on the rated current of the power\nanalyzer.\n5.2 Iron Loss Analysis of an MF Transformer using\niGSE Fig. 18 shows the experimental and the calculated\nresults for the iron loss in an MF transformer with an amor-\nphous core. From Fig. 18, the calculation result generally\ncorresponds to the experimental result. Therefore, the valid-\nity of the iron loss analysis of an MF transformer using iGSE\nis conﬁrmed experimentally.\n5.3 Iron Loss Separation Method The blue line in\nFig. 19 shows the sum of the hysteresis loss and the eddy-\ncurrent loss in the amorphous core obtained using the iron\nloss separation method. The other results in Fig. 19 are the\nsame as those shown in Fig. 18. From Fig. 19, the separation\nresults correspond to the experimental results. Therefore, the\nvalidity of the iron loss separation method for an MF trans-\nformer is conﬁrmed.\n5.4 Total Loss Analysis of the Magnetic Components\nThe experimental conﬁguration used to measure the total\nloss of an MF transformer and inductors is shown in Fig. 20.\nFigures 21 and 22 show the experimental results and the\ncalculated results for the total loss in the MF transformer with\nan amorphous core in Fig. 21, a silicon steel core in Fig. 22,\nand the inductors with an HK-36D core. In Figs. 21 and 22,\nthe low δregion contains several diﬀerences between the ex-\nperimental results and the calculated results. In the low δ\nregion, the excited voltage waveform to the MF transformer\n392 IEEJ Journal IA, Vol.4, No.4, 2015\nLoss Analysis of Magnetic ComponentsʢMizuki Nakahara et al.ʣ\nFig. 18.

Total loss calculation and measurement results\nusing the amorphous core in the MF transformer and HK-\n36D in the inductors\nis not the ideal waveform shown in Fig. 4; this is because the\nDC-DC converter is in hard-switching operation because of\nthe dead time (8). In this measurement, the dead time of the\nI G B T si ss e tt o3μs, and the switching frequency is set to\n10 kHz. From the condition shown in (8), the soft-switching\noperation region in this case is calculated as δ≥22\n◦.I n t h e\nsoft-switching operation region, the calculation results gen-\nerally correspond to the experimental results. Therefore, the\nvalidity of the total loss analysis of the magnetic components\nis conﬁrmed.\nFig. 22.

Conclusion\nThis paper presented an analysis method based on the\niGSE of the losses in the magnetic components in an isolated\nDC-DC converter for solid-state transformer.\nThe results showed that the iron loss when using the iGSE\ncorresponds to the experimental results, and that the analy-\nsis results when using the iron loss separation method also\ncorrespond to the experimental results.\nFurthermore, in this paper, a total loss analysis method\nfor the magnetic components, including the inductors, is pre-\nsented. The validity of the method is conﬁrmed by comparing\nits results to the experimental results. Using this method, the\ntotal loss design of the magnetic components of the isolated\nDC-DC converter is possible.\nReferences\n( 1 ) X. She, X. Yu, F. Wang, and A.
