    "abstract": "Abstract The renovation of traditional architecture contributes to the inheritance of cultural heritage and promotes the development of social civilization. However, executing renovation plans that simultaneously align with the demands of residents, heritage conservation personnel, and architectural experts poses a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce an Artificial Intelligence (AI) agent, Architectural GPT (ArchGPT), designed for comprehensively and accurately understanding needs and tackling architectural renovation tasks, accelerating and assisting the renovation process. To address users’ requirements, ArchGPT utilizes the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for task planning. Operating under the use of tools, task-specific models, and professional architectural guidelines, it resolves issues within the architectural domain through sensible planning, combination, and invocation. Ultimately, ArchGPT achieves satisfactory results in terms of response and overall satisfaction rates for customized tasks related to the conservation and restoration of traditional architecture.",
