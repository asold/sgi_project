Wilkinson \nSunway University \n \n \n \nThe recently developed large language model artificial intelligence (AI) systems, such as ChatGPT , are \nlikely to become wide ly used over the next few years as  core tools in many areas of business. Higher \neducation graduates will need to be adequately prepared with the necessary generic skills to exploit this \ntechnology and a detailed understanding of the risks of using it and related ethical aspects  to maximize \ntheir employability . H igher education institutions will need to develop  training to support this  and a \nconceptual multi-layer framework is proposed for generic skills development in higher education relevant \nto the emerging new era of large language model AI . This model  encapsulates traditional generic skills \ntraining for employability, the extended skill sets needed for operating as independent knowledge-workers \nin increasingly fragmented working contexts, and the new sets of skills in areas such as prompt engineering, \noutput verification and bias detection, which are needed specifically for operating as effective users of \nadvanced AI systems in business. \n \nKeywords: higher education , artificial intelligence, large language models , ChatGPT, generic skills \ndevelopment, graduate employability \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nIt has long been recognized that acquiring generic skills is an important aspect of higher education  to \nmake graduates more employable. Consequently, most higher education institutions now explicitly foster \ngeneric skills acquisition through their academic curricula, dedicated skills training programs, and  work-\nbased learning opportunities . However, given the recent advent of large language model artificial \nintelligence (AI) systems, such as ChatGPT, which are likely to transform significantly the future of work \nin many business sectors, it is now necessary to review and augment the kinds of generic skills training that \nstudents need for their future employment. The focus of this paper is on the implications of ChatGPT and \nsimilar systems for higher education generic skills training. The aim, in particular, is to identify new kinds \nof training that students will require in order to become more employable in a world where artificial \nintelligence systems are likely to become embedded in many business processes  across a wide range of \nindustries and professions, and moreover to draw on best practice in generic skills acquisition known to \ndate to inform the approaches to the new kinds of training required. \n Journal of Higher Education Theory and Practice Vol. 24(3) 2024 65 \nBACKGROUND: GENERIC SKILLS TRAINING IN HIGHER EDUCATION \n \nThe need for generic skills training in higher education has been evident for  around thirty years, with \nmuch research taking place on generic skills development over that period to ensure g raduates are well-\nequipped to contribute to knowledge -based economies (Cornalli, 2018). To clarify nomenclature, in  this \npaper the term “generic skills” will be used to refer to skills that are not explicitly related to a specific \nsubject of academic study at university but are of a gener al nature related to increasing the employability \nof graduates in professional roles . These types of skills are also variously referred to as  “basic skills”, \n“transferable skills” and “soft skills” in the literature. However, “soft skills” may sometimes be used more \nnarrowly for skills related to human interaction such as teamworking or communication skills. In contrast, \ngeneric skills may embrace a broader set of skills such as proficiency with office information technology . \nThe concept of employability often means that a graduate not only has relevant specialist knowledge and \nexpertise for a particular employment sector or job type but also possesses the necessary generic skills to \nbe a competent employee who fits in and contributes effectively in a corporate environment. The concept \nof employability also embraces the idea that graduates are “attractive” to a wide range  of employers. \nHowever, it has been argued that focusing higher education on this is a consequence of the massification \nof higher education and may not be entirely compatible with the broader aim of higher education supporting \ncivil society and social justice (Boden & Nedeva, 2010). \nThere have been several reviews and studies of generic skills needed by employers and of “skills gaps” \nwhere there is a perception by employers of a lack of relevant generic skills among graduates (e.g. Andrews \n& Higson, 2008; Jackson, 2010; Robles, 2012; Tuononen et al., 2022), although interestingly some studies \nhave pointed to skills mismatches rather than skills gaps (e.g. Cappelli, 2015) . Most studies on generic \nskills requirements and gaps reported in the literature have taken place in the pre -ChatGPT era. Generic \nskills typically identified pre-ChatGPT include communication, teamwork, critical thinking, problem -\nsolving, work ethic and integrity, leadership capability, basic competence with office information \ntechnology, effective time management, good work attitude and courtesy . Some of these skills can be \nbroken down into more detailed capabilities such as visual presentation skills, verbal communication skills, \nwritten communication skills etc., and some can also be described as personal attributes rather than skills \nsuch as work ethic. The lack of generic skills among higher education graduates and the limitations of \nhigher education to provide them has been a continuing concern globally both of employers and graduates \nas studies in countries in different parts of the world over the last ten years have shown (e.g. Asonitou, \n2015; Boahin, 2018; Pereira, 2013; Pitan, 2017; Singh et al., 2014; Tran, 2013; Zuber Abd Majid et al., \n2020). \n \nPERCEPTIONS OF GENERIC SKILLS NEEDS \n \nStudies of the perceptions of generic skills needs for employability among various stakeholder groups \nsuch as employers, students, graduates , and higher education academic teaching staff have revealed \nsignificant differences (Emin Bakay, 2022; Jackson, 2012; Rosenberg et al., 2012) . Interesting findings \nhave emerged from individual studies , such as that female graduates have more confidence about their \nability to acquire generic skills than males (Wickramasinghe & Perera, 2010); that the perceived importance \nof generic skills acquisition by students varies according to the subject of the degree they are studying (e.g. \nAranda et al., 2022) ; that academics consider problem -solving most important whereas corporate human \nresources managers value teamwork and collaboration skills more highly (Emin Bakay, 2022); that business \nstudents tend to over -estimate their own employability skills (Jackson, 2012); and that  human resources \nrecruiters believe leadership skills generally are below the expectations of industry (e.g. Rosenberg et al., \n2012). It is difficult to generali ze globally from such findings but it is clear that perceptions continue to \ndiffer and that skills acquisition is still a contentious issue worldwide among the stakeholder groups. The \nadvent of ChatGPT and similar AI systems is likely to accentuate differences of perceptions a bout skills \ntraining needs in the short term as employers, students, and academics grapple independently with trying \nto understand the importance and impact of the technology on jobs and careers. \n66 Journal of Higher Education Theory and Practice Vol. 24(3) 2024 \nTHE ACQUISITION OF TRADITIONAL GENERIC SKILLS \n \nBesides understanding what generic skills are needed by graduates, the means of acquisition of such \nskills by students has also received much attention in higher education institutions and the effectiveness of \ngeneric skill development is considered to be important in quality audits of higher education provision \n(Clanchy & Ballard, 1995). Efforts are generally made to incorporate skills acquisition in academic \ncurricula and special purpose learning experiences, but many factors influence the effectiveness o f these. \nConventional lecture-based teaching has been well -recognized as not conducive to acquiring business-\nrelevant generic skills. Instead, more active forms of learning applying knowledge in real world contexts \nwith students collaborating across disciplines have been proposed (Nelson, 2021). Other studies have shown \nthat the lack of academic staff with industry experience and over -dependence on teaching theoretical \ncontent have created problems in teaching generic skills and that students need interactive class -based \nactivities, self-directed learning and problem-solving to improve their generic skills acquisition (Okolie et \nal., 2019). The use of interdisciplinary teamwork to augment project-based learning has also been found to \nbe effective for generic skills acquisition (Vogler et al., 2018). Work-integrated learning experiences such \nas internships or work placements are seen as highly valuable in generic skills acquisition, but there is a \nneed for good placement design and appropriate preparation of students for such experiences to get the \noptimum outcomes (Jackson, 2015). Dual study programs involving split periods between academia and \nindustry have also been recommended (Tastanbekova et al., 2021). Students and graduates have been found \nto regard industrial placements and post-graduation employment as more effective than university studies \nto acquire generic skills and regard the opportunity to have collaborative learning experiences and be given \nresponsibility as particularly helpful (Crebert et al., 2004) . Efforts have also been made to incentivi ze \nstudents to improve their generic skills acquisition during their higher education studies by developing \nschemes to assess, grade, and accredit their generic skills learning culminating in recognition through digital \nbadges (O’Connor et al., 2016). Regardless of the types of generic skills learning experiences on offer and \ntheir general effectiveness , it still remains evident that success in student acquisition of such skills can \ndepend on several other independent socio -academic factors such as student gender, performance in \nacademic studies, or whether their geographic origin is urban or rural (Chamorro-Premuzic et al., 2010; De \nPrada et al., 2022; Zuber Abd Majid et al., 2020).  \n \nTHE EVOLUTION OF GENERIC SKILLS NEEDS \n \nEven prior to the advent of large language model AI systems, there has been a growing recognition in \nrecent years of the need for generic skills acquired by students to evolve to equip them more effectively for \nthe changing global business environment. The recent introduction of large language model AI systems has \nonly made such an evolution  even more necessary. Traditionally, generic skills training has focused on \nemployers’ needs and ensuring that higher education graduates can fit in and be valuable contributors in \nknowledge-based roles in companies. However, the so-called mega-trends in higher education and the labor \nmarket, such as the marketization of higher education with students expecting rapid “pay back” for their \ninvestment in their studies, the growth of erratic, fragmented or portfolio careers,  and the increasing \ndigitalization of business with the trend towards online “gig” economies, are all having an impact on generic \nskills needs for graduates (Kornelakis & Petrakaki, 2020) . Increasing use of AI and the potential \ndisplacement of workers will also accentuate these trends. Several new generic skills requirements have \nbeen identified to enable graduates to survive and thrive in career terms in the shifting work context that \nhas been emerging globally over the past decade. These skills include entrepreneurial and risk-taking skills, \nself-promotion skills (especially online), networking skills  (especially the ability to build both \nprofessional/technical and social support networks), bidding and strategizing skills, self-management skills, \nremote-team working skills, resilience and capability to face frequent rejections, and the ability to cope \nwith highly fragmented working patterns (Wilkinson, 2017). To date it is apparent that many, if not most, \nhigher education institutions have not yet fully embraced the majority of these new skills requirements, \nalthough, an unexpected positive outcome from the COVID-19 pandemic was to make many students more \n Journal of Higher Education Theory and Practice Vol. 24(3) 2024 67 \nadaptable to working flexibly and under more self-management in a remote context. Another notable trend \nis the growing awareness that graduates need a good understanding of sustainability issues and that not only \ndo students studying sustainability programs need to acquire generic skills but also generic skills focused \non understanding sustainability and acting professionally in ways to enhance personal and corporate \nsustainability are becoming more important for all students  (Brundiers & Wiek, 2017) . At the present \njuncture, it is clear that skills training in higher education now needs to evolve not just to embrace the latest \nbusiness and societal mega-trends before ChatGPT but must now also evolve to cover the likely enormous \nimpacts of AI on business globally which are likely to become evident  quite rapidly within the next few \nyears.  \n \nLARGE LANGUAGE MODEL AI SYSTEMS  \n \nAfter more than half a century of research on the theoretical understanding and practical \nimplementation of AI systems across the globe, the introduction of ChatGPT as a publicly available AI chat \nsystem in late 2022 was a landmark in the history of computer science and its application. Whilst it is still \ntoo early to comprehend the full impact of this development, it is likely to stand alongside the introduction \nof the internet, the development of the personal computer, and the roll-out of mobile telephony as one of \nthe key technological developments to significantly change business and society. Developed by the OpenAI \norganization, ChatGPT is a large language model system, a type of generative AI. ChatGPT can generate \nlong text responses to questions, queries, or prompts input to it by human users. ChatGPT uses deep learning \nneural networks trained with a large body of data drawn from open internet sources to generate suitable text \nresponses to users. GPT refers to generative pre-trained transformer, a type of learning architecture initially \ndeveloped for machine translation (Vaswani et al., 2017) . The power of such large language model AI \nsystems derives from the massive volume of training data used, the sophistication of the neural network \nalgorithms, and the enormous computing power used to process the training data and generate the output. \nWhen writing this article, the most up -to-date version of ChatGPT uses the software version GPT -4. Its \ninput is limited to 2048 “tokens, “ the separate digital elements into which a body of text is deconstructed \nfor analysis; these are broadly equivalent to words or punctuation marks. Outputs can be hundreds of words \nin length; there is no theoretical limit, only a limit posed by the computational practicality of systems \nserving millions of users concurrently. In order to get the most sophisticated responses to complex inputs, \nit is possible to break input information into multiple inputs each of which remains within the token limit  \nbut collectively  can well exceed it . ChatGPT is also limited by having training data that contains \ninformation up to September 2021 so it does not know events or new information beyond that date, though \nit is highly probable that more up-to-date information will be used to train such systems in the future. Even \nthough ChatGPT is impressive in its ability to generate text , which is almost indistinguishable from what \ncan be produced by a highly knowledgeable and well-informed human, some deficiencies exist besides the \ndate limit on its knowledge. ChatGPT can occasionally produce incorrect or false information, sometimes \nreferred to as hallucinations. Also, its responses can be biased because it uses information drawn from \npublic sources on the internet , which  might be biased , which is a general problem for all AI systems \n(Nowotny, 2021). There is also the potential for it to plagiarize given that it draws information from its vast \nbank of training data to construct responses and might take existing phrases from within such data. ChatGPT \ndoes not understand what it produces (Floridi, 2023); it uses publicly available information and user input \nto construct a meaningful response to an input matching text patterns and predicting text. This distinction \nbetween cognitive ability and pattern -based text prediction is important  because it means the outputs of \nlarge language model AI systems need human verification. It should be noted, however, that some evidence \nhas recently been found that large language models can perform certain types of reasoning (Webb et al., \n2023) therefore they should not be viewed solely as dumb pattern prediction machines. \n68 Journal of Higher Education Theory and Practice Vol. 24(3) 2024 \nBUSINESS IMPACT OF LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL AI SYSTEMS \n \nIt is becoming widely recogni zed that large language model AI systems such as ChatGPT will have \nprofound disruptive impacts on business and society (Mondal et al., 2023; Shaji George et al., 2023)  and \nthat there will be a “gold rush” with companies seeking to develop software applications making use of the \ntechnology to generate new areas of business (Rotman, 2023). But even without new software apps based \non it, what is becoming very clear is that given the ability of the existing interactive ChatGPT system to \ngenerate credible high-quality text in response to user inputs, any jobs that involve the creation of reports \nor documents will be significantly affected by the use of this technology  as anyone, anywhere can use it . \nThis could include jobs that involve writing consultancy reports, marketing strategies, audit reports, \nbusiness plans, advertising copy, media articles, legal briefs, software code etc. It has also been recognized \nthat ChatGPT could assist in management decision-making and in corporate knowledge management \n(Korzynski et al., 2023). Hardly any professional job would not be impacted by this and there is growing \nconcern that many white -collar jobs will disappear (DePillis & Lohr, 2023) . But the impact of large \nlanguage model AI will not just be restricted to business processes in companies. These systems will also \nbe valuable in science (Stokel-Walker & Van Noorden, 2023) , data science (Hassani & Silva, 2023) , \neducation (AlAfnan et al., 2023; Cooper, 2023; Lim et al., 2023), and medicine and healthcare (Cascella et \nal., 2023; Chow et al., 2023). It is also notable that ChatGPT has much potential in translation (which is the \nfield for which generative AI was first developed) , in research (Burger et al., 2023; Dwivedi et al., 2023)  \nand will be useful for academic libraries (Lund & Wang, 2023) , though concerns remain about its use in \nscholarly publishing (Liebrenz et al., 2023; Lund et al., 2023; Thorp, 2023) because of the above-mentioned \nissues of potential bias, hallucination and plagiarism.  It should be noted that b esides systems such as \nChatGPT which focus on text generation, alternative AI systems such as DALL -E and Stable Diffusion, \nwhich can generate graphical images and designs from text prompts, are also likely to impact significantly \non certain aspects of business in the creative industries in particular. \nEven though it is likely that large language model AI systems will provide many benefits to businesses \nand society as they become widely used , for completeness, it should be noted that there is also growing \nconcern that as these systems further evolve there could be significant risks to humanity and that regulation \nwill be required to ensure that they do not endanger human existence (Russell, 2023). There is a growing \nawareness of the need for governance of AI systems and adopting measures to minimize their risks. Some \nAI governance and risk management frameworks have begun to be developed (National Institute of \nStandards and Technology, 2023; PDPC, 2020)  with more under -development such as the proposed \nEuropean Union regulation on harmonized rules on AI which in particular focuses on high-risk uses of AI \nthat might pose potential risk to the health, safety or fundamental rights of individuals (European \nCommission, 2021). Business users of AI will need to follow good AI governance procedures and comply \nwith any related regulations or legal requirements in their relevant jurisdiction. Graduates will need to be \naware of such matters as they become business users of AI systems. \n \nGENERIC SKILLS NEEDS IN RELATION TO LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL AI SYSTEMS \n \nGiven the major impact that large language model AI systems will have on many aspects of work, it is \nimperative that students are adequately prepared for employment in which the use of AI will become \nessential. Employers across the globe will likely see AI systems such as ChatGPT as a means to improve \nproductivity and reduce labor costs at professional and semi-professional levels, thereby almost certainly \nresulting in fewer jobs for higher education graduates. To obtain or retain jobs, graduates will need to master \nthe use of AI so they can individually become more productive and valuable to employers. The outlook \nseems bleak for those who cannot not adapt to this likely change. Apart from students aiming to enter \ncorporate employment upon graduation, some may expect to become entrepreneurs or freelance gig \nworkers. In this latter context , the ability to use AI systems effectively will become essential as the \nindividuals concerned will need to use every tool at their disposal to become highly efficient and globally \ncompetitive. Given this emerging situation, it is now necessary for higher education institutions to view \n Journal of Higher Education Theory and Practice Vol. 24(3) 2024 69 \ntraining on the use of large language model AI as a vital and obligatory new element of generic skills \ntraining for all students. \n \nREQUIREMENTS FOR GENERIC SKILLS TRAINING FOR THE USE OF AI \n \nThe implementation of generic skills training for the use of AI needs to embrace several aspects  of \nthese systems as follows: \n \nKnowledge and Understanding of AI System Competence and Incompetence  \nStudents and graduates need to understand the basic principles of systems such as ChatGPT and be very \naware of their  capabilities, technical limitations and restrictions, and potential for error. In particular the \ntechnical limits on the date limit s of training data, the restrictions on  input and output length and the \nreliability, potential for bias, hallucination and plagiarism all need to be understood. It is only by having a \nfull understanding of the limitations, competence and incompetence of AI systems  can a user make \nprofessional use of them. The priority is always to avoid having an AI system generate inaccurate, biased, \nmisleading or plagiarized content that then goes into official business documents of any kind as the business \nconsequences, or even the potential for litigation , may be significant depending on the nature of the \ngenerated content and its intended audience. \n \nPractical Skills in Designing and Packaging AI Input \nIf a large language model AI system such as ChatGPT is to be used to generate complex and lengthy \nprofessional reports then it is necessary for it to be given the right input to enable it to do that. Given the \nlimitations on input and output text stream length, it is necessary to break  report creation tasks into \nmeaningful sub-tasks and to design inputs to “tease out” the desired text responses for each sub-task. The \nterm “tease out” here is used because essentially it is effectively impossible to determine  in advance how \naccurate or relevant a text response from the system might be. It may be unfocused or off the point of the \ndesired answer possibly because the system has misunderstood the user ’s input or has been led astray by \nparticular training information. Learning how to nudge the system into refining its answers in order to home \nin on the desired output is a necessary skill to be developed. \n \nSkills in Making Innovative Connections \nOne of the most powerful uses of large language model AI systems is to generate new ideas that could \nlead to business innovations. As described earlier, although large language model AI systems have no \ninherent cognitive ability, they can find patterns in their training data and make connections between ideas \nand concepts that have not been made by any humans before , simply because of their ability to process \nenormous volumes of data and information very quickly across a wide plethora of topics and subjects. There \nis potential for such systems to help create new business ideas and opportunities. Users need to be aware of \nthis possibility and to have the skill needed to prompt AI systems to do this. Graduates who can create new \nbusiness opportunities through probing large language model AI systems will be highly valued as \nemployees and have the potential to become highly successful innovators and entrepreneurs. \n \nSkills in Output Repackaging, Evaluation and Refinement \nUltimately output from large language model AI systems, if used professionally, will need to be \nrepackaged, evaluated and refined. There must be close attention to verifying output for accuracy, ensuring \nit is not biased, and checking that none of the content produced has been plagiari zed. In reality, the use of \nlarge language model AI systems is an exercise not in exploiting AI as a tool to do all of the work that a \nhuman would do. Instead, it is an exercise in human -machine collaboration whereby a powerful and \nproductive tool becomes the assistant to a human, but with the human always being the supe rvisor and \nverifier who takes full responsibility for what is produced. The skill of output oversight , and if necessary \nrefinement, is a necessary requirement for effective human-machine collaboration. \n70 Journal of Higher Education Theory and Practice Vol. 24(3) 2024 \nIMPLEMENTATION APPROACHES FOR AI GENERIC SKILLS TRAINING \n \nThe implementation of skills training for use of large language model AI systems should adopt the best \npractices in generic skills learning identified to date. This should include collaborative work, \ninterdisciplinary activities, and ideally work integrated learning experiences given the conclusions of many \nstudies on generic skills teaching and learning as reported earlier. It is likely that most students will now be \nfamiliar with using systems such as ChatGPT within the scope of their everyday academic studies. It has \nbecome clear that ChatGPT can improve student productivity (Fauzi et al., 2023)  and can help them \nconsolidate their learning and gain deeper understanding of topics through interactive dialogue (Rospigliosi, \n2023).  Most higher education institutions are devising guidelines and codes of practice on AI usage to \nensure that students use systems such as ChatGPT to improve their learning experience and not  cheat in \nassessments and reduce their learning. But while familiarity with ChatGPT may be becoming widespread \nat a superficial level to assist in learning, generic skills training on AI for employability purposes needs to \nbe formalized and structured to cover deeper topics essential for business use of AI  rather than academic \nuse. A number of core learning activities can be identified as follows: \n(a) Theoretical instruction  on AI systems and ethics . The starting point for generic skills \nacquisition on using large language model AI systems ought to be to convey a basic \nunderstanding of the systems, their limitations, and ethical dimensions  regarding their use . \nClass-based instruction of these aspects supplemented with interactive exercises may be \neffective. But this should ultimately only be the groundwork for more extensive practical \nexercises as below. The acquisition of theoretical knowledge mustn ’t become a burden that \ndetracts from fully experiencing and working with AI systems on complex projects.  \n(b) Prompt engineering exercises. “Prompt engineering” is the term now used for designing the \ninputs to large language model AI systems to get optimal outputs for the objective required and \nstudents need to be trained on this. Publications have begun to appear on this topic (e.g. Roth, \n2023; Tull, 2023)  as well as some online video courses , though this is still a relatively \nundeveloped field at the present time. In particular there is a need for methodologies to be \ndeveloped for designing sequences of prompts in order to produce a complex set of outputs that \ncan be assembled into large documents that may be required in a business context. Techniques \nsuch as storyboarding which have been used in designing human-computer interactions in the \npast (e.g. Truong et al., 2006) as well as possibly some approaches used in software engineering \nmay be useful in this context , though this needs further exploration  and is for future \nconsideration. At this point in time, it is recommended that students should get practical \nexperiences of designing complex interactions with large language model AI systems, such as \nChatGPT, using what is already known about effective prompt engineering. Ideally such \npractical exercises shou ld focus on real world business problems and involve collaborative  \nteams of students from different disciplines working together to create large document s using \nthe AI system. The involvement of industrial partners in such exercises would be beneficial. \nAt the present time where the use of large language model AI is still in its infancy there could \nbe valuable learning experiences for employers in engaging with higher education institutions \nin such activities to create a two-way learning process for students and employers.   \n(c) Practical output verification tasks. Verifying outputs, eliminating bias and plagiarism should \nalso be key objectives of skills training on AI. From a practical perspective this should include \npractice with using plagiarism detection tools, such as TurnItIn, which are now widely used in \nhigher education institutions. Although such tools are widely used, their use is often restricted \nto academic staff who aim to detect cheating by their students. Ideally institutions should ensure \nthat such tools are availab le not only to academic staff but also to students as the tools will \nbecome vital elements in evaluating the outputs of AI systems. Students should be trained to \nbecome proficient in the use of such tools and should regard them as essential in using large \nlanguage model AI systems for business purposes. Such proficiency should be seen as an \nessential generic skill. Besides plagiarism avoidance, students need training on how to verify \n Journal of Higher Education Theory and Practice Vol. 24(3) 2024 71 \nAI outputs for accuracy and avoidance of bias. It is suggested that this is best done through \ncollaborative exercises in which teams of students undertake practice exercises to verify and \ndetect bias in specific examples of AI output. Detection of falsities and bias can be difficult to \ndo, and is very much dependent on the nature of the output and its context. Ideally , higher \neducation institutions should design practical exercises enabling students to collaboratively \ninvestigate how they can verify particu lar outputs by cross -referencing to alternative reliable \nsources, looking for inconsistencies in outputs, and engaging with experts if needed. Learning \nhow to spot biases should ideally also be done collaboratively. Some aspects of corporate \ndiversity training could potentially be adapted and used in this context and research is needed \non this. \n \nCONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK OF THE EVOLUTION OF EMPLOYABILITY SKILLS \n \nThrough combining the traditional generic skills needed by graduates for employability, the skills \nneeded for more flexible working, and the emerging needs of business with increasing AI utilization that \nhave been discussed, we can conceive a potential over -arching framework that reflects what skills \ndevelopment should ideally be offered by higher education institutions going forward, as in Figure 1. \n \nFIGURE 1 \nCONCEPTUAL FRAMWORK OF EVOLVING GENERIC SKILLS DEVELOPMENT \n \n \n \nAt the heart of this model lies the set of traditional generic skills that are well-known as being essential \nfor optimum graduate employability. But, in addition, this model incorporates as a novel element the skills \nSkills for the emerging era of widespread AI usage by businesses and the self-employed \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n• Understanding of AI technology and relevant AI ethical/legal frameworks \n• AI prompt engineering \n• AI output evaluation (verification, plagiarism detection) \n• AI output packaging and product construction \n \nSkills for independent fragmented careers/portfolio careers in the era of  \nmass digitalization and potential job replacement by technologies inc. AI \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n• Entrepreneurial & risk-taking skills \n• Self-promotion & branding skills \n• Networking skills \n• Self-management skills \n• Remote team-working skills \n• Resilience to cope with fragmented work opportunities \nCore generic skills for corporate employability \n• Communications skills (verbal, written, visual) \n• Teamwork skills \n• Critical thinking skills \n• Problem solving skills \n• Good work ethic/attitude and integrity \n• Leadership capability \n• IT competence \n• Time management skill \n \n72 Journal of Higher Education Theory and Practice Vol. 24(3) 2024 \nneeded for graduates to operate independently, whether by choice because they choose to become self -\nemployed or because they find themselves forced into self -employment because of job market changes \nwhich may or may not be driven by rapid growth in business use of advanced technologies including AI. \nThese skills for independent working extend outwardly the generic skills needed by graduates to embrace \nthe concept of the graduate as an independent knowledge -worker who may not be tied t o one specific \nemployer full-time or for a significant length of time. The model then embraces at a higher level the novel \nset of skills needed in the era of widespread AI adoption, essentially for a graduate to operate effectively \neither as an employee of a corporation that proactively embraces AI in its core business activities or for a \ngraduate actively to exploit AI to maximize their own personal efficiency as an independent knowledge -\nworker operating in a highly competitive global environment. Overall, the conceptual model encapsulates \nin the three successive layers the optimum set of generic skills needed by new graduates from higher \neducation in the new era in which AI is becoming increasingly embedded in business and likely to change \nemployment patterns with significant consequences for their long-term careers. It is possible that this model \ncould be structured in alternative ways. There is much scope for debate around this and how best to deliver \nthe types of skills training identified. Still,  regardless of how to construc t such a framework it is almost \ninevitable that generic skills training in all higher education institutions will need to embrace the issues, \ncompetencies and themes identified here. \n \nDISCUSSION \n \nIt is now widely recognized that the advent of large language model AI systems is going to create major \nchanges in the way in which many employees carry out their work tasks across many private and public \nsector organizations. There is also likely to be significant down-sizing of teams in certain types of job roles \nwith knock-on effects on society and graduate careers. Therefore, higher education institutions must make \nthe necessary changes in generic skills training for students to ensure they are well -equipped with the \nmaximum employability skills in this new and rapidly evolving context. This paper has attempted to outline \nthe key issues involved and to suggest types of generic skills training required especially relating to topics \nsuch as prompt engineering and AI output evaluation as part of an extended conceptual framework for skills \ntraining in higher education. It should be noted, however, that large language model AI is still in the early \nstages of adoption worldwide. The full extent of how it will be used and its full impact on economies and \nsocieties is yet to be fully understood. Nevert heless, higher education institutions should recogni ze the \nurgency of giving their graduates the best employment opportunities by initiating generic skills training on \nusing and applying AI systems. It is likely that such training will be relatively rudimentary at the beginning, \nbut will develop as new methodologies emerge in areas such as prompt engineering. There also exists the \npossibility that AI systems could be used in the delivery of generic skills training and research is needed on \nthis. Finally, while this paper has focused on training needs concerning generic skills associated with using \nlarge language model AI systems, it must be recognized that specialist training will also be needed for those \ngraduates who are likely to become not just professional users of such systems but active developers. Any \nsuch training must embrace the growing concerns about AI safety and governance. \n \nREFERENCES \n \nAlAfnan, M.A., Dishari, S., Jovic, M., & Lomidze, K. (2023).
