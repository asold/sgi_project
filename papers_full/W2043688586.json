In this paper a survey \nof recent R&D efforts in this field is presented. \n \nIndex Terms —Power Electronic Transformer, Railway, \nMedium Frequency Transformer, Multilevel Converter.  \n \nI. INTRODUCTION \nOWADAYS,  conventional line frequency transformers \n(LFT) are widely spread in  electrical systems providing \nbasic functionalities such as voltage isolation and voltage \nadaptation. However, to deal with power quality problems \n(e.g., sags, swells, flicker and harmonics) at medium voltage \n(MV) levels, there is a need for the installation of additional \nequipment (usually some kind of power electronics converter \noperating at higher switching frequencies). This leads to a \nfurther increase of the installation volume, which in certain \napplications may not be feasible (traction, marine, wind, \noffshore). Recent trends in MV  high power applications are \nreplicating something that has already been achieved and put \ninto practice in low voltage applications. There, line frequency \noperated transformers have mos tly been replaced by medium \nfrequency transformers (MFTs) where high frequency \nwaveforms are applied directly to the transformer terminals, \nso that the overall magnetic volume is reduced and more \ncompact converter designs are reached. Some of the results \nfrom this field are presented here, with the scope of this paper \nbeing  \n \n \nManuscript received 30 May 2012. Accep ted for publication 10 June 2012. \nSome results of this paper were presented at the 16th International Symposium \nPower Electronics, Novi Sad, Serbia, October 26-28, 2012. \nD.Dujic, F.Kieferndorf and F.Canales are with the ABB Switzerland Ltd, \nCorporate Research, Segelhofstrasse 1K, Baden-Daettwil, 5405, Switzerland \n(+41 58 586 75 40; fax: +41 58 586 40 06;  e-mail: drazen.dujic@ch.abb.com, \nfrederick.kieferndorf@ch.abb.com, francisco.canales@ch.abb.com).  \n \n \nlimited to railway applications (thus, single phase). \nTraction applications are recognized as one of the likely \nearly adopters of this emerging technology. Typical single \nphase railway AC lines found in Europe are 15kV, 16 ⅔Hz \n(originating from the use of cycloconvertors in the past and \nthus being one third of 50Hz) and 25kV, 50Hz. A \nconventional (state-of-the-art) approach to provide DC \nvoltage to the variable speed drive on the locomotive is \nillustrated in a simplified manner in Fig.1. The primary \nwinding of the LFT is connected directly to the AC catenary \nand active rectifier(s) are connected to the secondary \nwinding(s) of the transformer where the voltage is stepped \ndown. One or more inverter and motor units are further \nconnected to the provided DC link (not illustrated in Fig.1). \nSince traction LFTs are usually optimized for minimum \nweight (2-4kg/kVA) and are heavily loaded, the resulting \nefficiency is rather poor and somewhere in the range of 90%-\n92%. Oil is customarily used for cooling and insulation, \nadding to the total weight and potential environmental issues \n(i.e. in case of leakage). The power of the system may vary \nfrom below 1MVA up to 10MVA for large cargo locomotives. \nIn a classical train arrangement, where the propulsion \nsystem is concentrated in the locomotive, the weight of a LFT \nis not necessary a problem, since a certain weight is required \nin any case in order to provide sufficient traction without \nslipping. However, in the case of electric multiple units \n(EMUs), where the propulsion system is distributed \nthroughout the train, weight becomes an issue. \n \nFig. 1 AC-DC conversion with a line frequency transformer (LFT). \n \nFig. 2. AC-DC conversion with medium frequency transformer (MFT). \nN\nDOI: 10.7251/ELS1216050D \nELECTRONICS, VOL. 16, NO. 1, JUNE 2012 51\nAn alternative to the state-of-the-art solution is the use of a \nso called power electronic transformer (PET), consisting of a \npower converter in conjunction w ith MFT(s), as illustrated in \nFig.2. Here, some sort of power electronic converter is \nconnected directly to the AC  catenary, while the MFT is \nproviding voltage insulation and adaptation.  \nPresent semiconductor devices are unable to work directly \nwith these medium voltages and thus usually some of kind of \nseries connection of a number of cells or modules is required \nin order to meet the voltage level of the MV line, resulting in a \nmultilevel converter structure. The MFT from Fig.2 is usually \nrealized not as one single transformer (although in some \nimplementations it is), but rather as a number of transformers \nrated for a fraction of the total power and operating at a higher \nswitching frequency (several kHz). Finally, rectification is \nrequired on the secondary side of the MFT in order to provide \na DC link to the inverter(s).  \nThis type of MV t echnology (although still under \ndevelopment) is becoming a reality with the advances in \nsemiconductor technology (faster switching actions, higher \nblocking voltages and higher power densities) and the \ndevelopment of new magnetic materials with low loss \ndensities at higher operating fre quencies. Even though early \nconsiderations regarding PET can be traced back to the \nseventies [1], at the present time there are still no products of \nthis kind offered by any of the key players in the traction \nmarket.\n \nII. STATE-OF-THE-ART: PET ARCHITECTURES \nVarious architectures/topologies have been considered for \nthe realization of a PET for tractions applications. Early works \nconsidered the use of thyristor based solutions [1], [2], as \nillustrated in Fig.3. The primary side of the MFT consists of \ntwo thyristor H-bridges connected in anti-parallel while the \nsecondary side has a single phase forced commutated H-\nbridge. Thus, there is a cycloconverter at the input (HV side) \nand voltage source inverter (VSI) at the output (LV side). \nIn this implementation, the MFT is excited from the \nsecondary side by the VSI and the MFT voltage is used to \ncommutate the cycloconverter on the primary side. Use of \nthyristors limits the MFT frequency to a few hundreds of \nHertz. In addition to low frequency, the circuit also generates \nfairly high line harmonics and improvements in this direction \nare reported in [3].  \nTo mitigate some of the issues with the thyristor based \napproach and further increase the operating frequency of the \nMFT, the use of fully controllable devices such as IGBTs has \nbeen proposed [4], [5]. In [4], the cycloconverter from Fig.3 \nhas been realized using IGBTs (series connection of two \nIGBTs with common emitter as a replacement for two anti-\nparallel thyristors) using at the same zero voltage switching \n(ZVS), while the VSI is realized as a standard IGBT H-bridge \nconverter. However, to achieve the line voltage, a series \nconnection of a number of IGBTs is required considering that, \nat present, the highest blocking voltage of commercially \navailable IGBTs is only 6.5kV. \nThus, a modular structure consisting of a number of \ncascaded cells (which are of the sa me nature as those in Fig.3, \nbut realized with IGBTs) has emerged, as shown in Fig.4. In \nthis arrangement, thanks to the voltage clamping of the \nsecondary side DC voltage through the MFT to the primary \nside, voltage sharing among the different cells is achieved. At \nthe same time, a multilevel voltage waveform at the input of \nthe PET helps to reduce the line harmonics and the resulting \nfilter requirements. In contrast to Fig.3, instead of having a \nsingle MFT, there is a need for a number of MFTs, each \nconnected to an associated cell and rated for a fraction of the \nfull power. However, insulation requirements are not relaxed \nand each MFT must be designed for the same dielectric stress \nas before. \nA PET prototype based on the topology from Fig.4 has \nbeen presented in [5], targeting 15kV, 16 ⅔Hz railway \nnetwork and with 1.2MVA ra tings (continuous operation). \nThe implementation had a total of 16 cells each consisting of a \ncycloconverter, MFT and VSI (rectifier). 3.3kV IGBTs were \nused on both primary and secondary sides, while the MFT was \noperated with 400Hz (see Fig.5). \n  \nRail\nCatenary\n \nFig. 3. PET topology with source commutated primary converter. \n \nFig. 4. PET topology with cascaded source commutated primary converters. \n \nELECTRONICS, VOL. 16, NO. 1, JUNE 2012 52\n \nFig. 5. ABB PET prototype (2006) using topology from Fig.4 [5]. \n \nTo avoid the difficulties w ith cycloconverters on the \nprimary side of the MFT and considering the fact that a \nnumber of cells is required anyhow, cascaded H-bridges (four \nquadrant converters) have been proposed by various research \ngroups [6-10 all references]. In this way, a pure IGBT solution \nis achieved and the number of required cells is primarily \nrelated to the selected voltage class of the semiconductors.  \nIn [6], a topology similar to the one shown in Fig.6, was \nproposed (the main difference is a lack of capacitors \nconnected to the MFT, thus being a non-resonant converter). \nThe input stages are realized with four quadrant converters \nand provide the intermediate DC links as well as a high \nresolution multilevel waveform at  the input of the converter. \nDC/DC converters are connected to each of the floating DC \nlinks and provide galvanic isolation and voltage level \nadaptation to the secondary side (as before all converters are \nconnected in parallel at the output). Power flow control is \nachieved through manipulation of the phase shift between the \nrectangular waveforms of the two sides of the DC/DC \nconverter. Various reconfigurati on possibilities of this kind of \ntopology are discussed by the same group of authors in [7]. \nA topology identical to the one shown in Fig. 6 has been \npresented in [8], [9]. A series resonant DC/DC converter is \nproposed in order to reduce switching losses of the \nsemiconductors (zero voltage switching (ZVS) and zero \ncurrent switching (ZCS)) and allow for further increase of the \nMFT operating frequency. For a 15kV railway network using \n6.5kV IGBTs, it was calculated that 7 cells would be required \nfor nominal operation (although adding an extra cell for \nredundancy reasons is proposed ) and the MFT frequency was \nexpected to be in the range of 8-10 kHz. Some details about \nthe control of this kind of PET can be found in [10]. \nMore considerations regarding the topology of Fig.6 can be \nfound in [11], [12]. Various arrangements have been analyzed \nand 6.5kV devices were selected as the most suitable ones, \nconsidering failure-in-time (FIT) rates and the number of \ndevices needed. To increase th e switching frequency, a soft \nswitching series resonant DC/DC converter with half bridges \non both sides of the MFT is considered. In addition to \nstandard IGBTs, modified semiconductor devices were tested \nas well. In particular, standard  IGBTs were irradiated with \nelectrons in order to move the device properties on the \ntechnology curve towards the area of lower turn off energies \n(reduction of carrier lifetime) but at the expense of higher on-\nstate voltage drop and thus higher static (conduction) losses. \nReported results emphasized th e possible increase of the \nswitching frequency in the range of 40-50% (at rated power). \nHowever, these kinds of devices are not commercially \navailable yet, except for limited engineering samples. \nA slightly different approach has been presented in [13]-\n[15] where multi-winding MFTs are used. The primary side is \nagain realized with a series connection of H-bridges providing \nintermediate HV side DC links from which the primary \nwindings of the multi-winding MFT are excited by half-bridge \nseries resonant converters ope rating at 5kHz. The secondary \nside is realized using a single H-bridge converter with \nbidirectional power flow. A full scale 1.5MW PET prototype \nwas realized featuring 8 cells in total (7 without redundancy). \nThe mass of the PET prototype was reported as 3.1T, in \ncomparison to 6.8T for a conventional LFT, however, at the \nexpense of 50% higher cost and jeopardized reliability due to \nthe use of 48 6.5kV IGBTs on the primary side of the multi-\nwinding MFT. The authors advertised upcoming field trials \nusing the developed PET prototype, but no further results \nwere reported. \n \nFig. 6.

PET topology with cascaded H-bridges and multi-winding MFT. \nELECTRONICS, VOL. 16, NO. 1, JUNE 2012 53\n \n \nFig. 8. PET topology using M2LC converter. \nUse of a modular multilevel converter (M2LC) for traction \napplications has been presented in [16], [17]. A simplified \nlayout is shown in Fig.8 (in the original publication there are \nmultiple secondary windings of the MFT with dedicated \nactive rectifiers, inverters and motors). M2LC is a highly \nmodular topology and the basic building blocks (cells) for \ntraction applications are H-bri dges connected in series, each \nwith its own DC capacitor bank, finally resembling a sort of \nlarge composite H-bridge, as shown in Fig.8. M2LCs are \nassociated with large amounts of stored energy in each cell but \nwith low energy density per cell, adding to the weight and \nvolume of the whole system. So far, in real world applications \nM2LC has been successfully commissioned only for HVDC \ninstallations. \nThe most recent reports concerning PETs in traction \napplication are reported in [18]-[20]. The topology is shown \nin Fig.9 and similar to the previous example it consists of \ncascaded H-bridges at the input and resonant DC-DC \nconverters with the power stage realized using a half-bridge \nconfiguration. Also, in contrast to the LC series resonant tank \nemployed in [8], [9] and [13]-[15], a LLC resonant tank is \nused.  Thus, both the leakage inductance and the magnetizing \ninductance of the transformer are participating in the \nresonance. In this way ZVS is achieved during turn-on of the \nIGBTs while near ZCS is achieved during turn-off of the \nIGBTs. Some results regarding the design and preliminary \ntesting of a DC/DC LLC resonant converter are presented in \n[18]. \nIn [19] the development of a low voltage PET prototype is \npresented, focusing primarily on the control features required \nfor characteristic operating regimes in traction applications. \nThe LV PET, shown in Fig.10, was used as an analogue \nhardware simulator since the implemented control HW was \nidentical to that used later in the full size PET reported in [20]. \nThe full sized MV PET prototype, shown in Fig.11, is \ndesigned for a 15kV, 16 ⅔Hz railway network with a 1.2MVA \npower rating (1.5kV output voltage) and is realized with 8 \ncells (+1 for redundancy) and a MFT operating at 1.8kHz.  \nRail\nCatenary\nCell 1\nCell N\nCell 2\n \nFig. 9.

The PET prototype was developed \nfor a field trial with Swiss Federal Railways and during the \npreparation of this paper it was already installed on the \nlocomotive and electrically co mmissioned. Since February \n2012,  the PET prototype is in service for a one year field trial.  \nELECTRONICS, VOL. 16, NO. 1, JUNE 2012 54\nIII. MEDIUM FREQUENCY TRANSFORMER \nDetails related to the MFT implementation were \ndeliberately omitted from the previous section, since this topic \nis difficult enough on its own, and due to the space limitations \nit is discussed here on a rather general level. Therefore, the \nbasic problems that are encountered in the design phase of an \nMFT are highlighted and some examples are illustrated. \nThe size of a transformer can typically be related to the area \nproduct, Ap, defined as [22]:  \nJf B K K\nPA\nm u f\nt\np =                    ( 1 )  \nWhen designing a MFT, all of the parameters present in (1) \nmust be carefully considered. The main idea behind the PET is \nto replace the bulky LFT with an overall more compact MFT \nor MFTs operating at a higher frequency (f), normally in the \nrange of several kHz. While increasing the operating \nfrequency (f) leads to a reduction of transformer size (Ap), \nhigh insulation requirements have a negative effect on the \nwindow utilization factor (Ku), resulting in a low filling factor \nof the window area due to the required amount of insulating \nmaterial. This is especially true in the case of the MFT for \nPET, where due to the lack of applicable standards, the MFT \nis usually designed to meet the same requirements as the direct \nAC line connected LFT. Theref ore, the required level of \ninsulation is nearly independent of all the other parameters in \n(1) since it is purely related to the system requirements. \nConsidering that the MFT is driven by rectangular rather than \nsinusoidal waveforms, the Kf factor which relates to the \nwaveform shape is different relative to a LFT. At the same \ntime, the Steinmetz parameters and associated core losses for \nthe selected material at a par ticular frequency are determined \nassuming sinusoidal excitation, which makes preliminary loss \nestimations rather inaccurate, and experimental \ncharacterization is often required. Materials usually \nconsidered for the MFT are: nanocrystalline, amorphous iron \nand/or ferrites. \nThe winding current density (J) is directly linked to the \nrequired cooling effort to re move generated heat from the \nwinding, thus having a huge impact on the selection of the \ncooling method. On the other hand,  selection of different core \nmaterials leads to different maximum operating flux density \n(Bm) and has an impact on the MFT size as well. Finally, \ncombining the requirements for high power (Pt), high \ninsulation (Ku), simple cooling (J) and lower flux densities \n(Bm) of suitable materials for the frequencies (f) of interest \nthe design of a high insulation, high power, MFT is not a \nstraightforward task. On top of that, since it is desirable to \nintegrate elements of the resonant tank into the MFT there is a \nneed to precisely control transformer inductances (leakage and \nmagnetizing) for proper resonant  operation, which introduces \nfurther complications into the design. The need to operate at \nhigher switching frequencies requires low leakage inductance \nwhich is at odds with the high insulation requirements which \ntypically results in higher leakage. \nConsidering selection of different core materials, silicon \nsteel is used in [5], nanocrystalline in [20,24], ferrites in [13] \nwhile amorphous iron is used in [23]. Regarding the cooling \nand insulation, oil is used in both [5] and [20], de-ionized \nwater for cooling of windings is used in [23,24], while \ninsulation is also provided by oil in [24]. Two particular \nexamples are illustrated in Fig.12 and 13. \nThe MFT shown in Fig.12 is realized using amorphous iron \ncore material with a coaxial winding structure and active de-\nionized water cooling through th e space available between the \nprimary and secondary windings. The prototype was designed \nfor 350kW and 10kHz switching frequency. The respective \ninsulation voltage testing is performed at 38kV and 50Hz for \n60 seconds, while the rated impulse voltage is 95kV. The use \nof coaxial type windings limits the turns ratio to 1:1, which \nwas acceptable in the case analyzed  in [23]. Special attention \nwas paid to properly assess the dielectric stress across the \nMFT in order to provide a design that could guarantee a long \nlifetime. \nA different design is shown in Fig.13 [20]. It features an \nassembly with three MFTs, each rated for 150kW (with the \nability to withstand 225kW overl oad for 60 seconds) and an \noperating frequency of 1.8kHz. The insulation test voltage and \nrated impulse voltage are similar to the previous case. The \nmaterial used for the core is nanocrystalline and the oil direct \nair forced (ODAF) cooling method is applied (the whole \nstructure being immersed into the oil), which solves the \nproblem of insulation at the same time. This type of MFT was \ninstalled in the 1.2MVA PET prototype shown in Fig.11, in \nthe oil filled tank visible at the bottom of the structure in \nFig.11. The inductive elements required for proper resonant \noperation are realized as the leakage and magnetizing \ninductance of the MFT. \n \n \nFig. 12. ABB MFT prototype (2002) [23]. \n \nFig. 13.

GENERAL REMARKS \nSomething that is not shown in any of the figures in section \n2 and should be mentioned, since it is always considered in \ntractions applications, is the presence of the 2nd harmonic \nripple in the DC link, which is an inherent property of single \nphase systems. In the original publications, referenced \nthroughout section 2, the 2nd harm onic filter (LC) is usually \nfound on the low voltage secondary side of the MFT. As an \nexample, in [13], the weight  of the 2nd harmonic filter is \n385kg, which compared to the weight of the rest of a system \n(around 3085kg) is more than 12%. The amount of the 2nd \nharmonic ripple is directly related to the power consumed \nduring operation, and it can be  partly suppressed by over-\nsizing of the DC link capacitors and increasing the amount of \nenergy stored locally.  \nAt the input of the PET, there is a need for a line inductor, \nsince the input stage is a four quadrant converter with power \nfactor capability, in essence a boost type converter. Taking \ninto account the frequency cancellation due to phase-shifted \noperation of the power modules, the resulting size of the \ninductor is minimized. However two additional considerations \nmust be taken into account. The first one is related to the use \nof this inductor to also filte r the line harmonics, for which a \nhigher value is usually needed than  that required for boost \noperation. In addition, if the line inductor is used to limit short \ncircuit in case of a fault, th e required value increases even \nfurther (e.g. in [20] 180mH air core inductor is used at the \ninput of the PET prototype). \nOn a more general note, the main concerns preventing PET \nproliferation into the market are the reliability and cost of the \ntechnology. The reliability ques tion comes simply from the \nfact that in order to realize a medium voltage multilevel \nconverter, a high number of semiconductors is needed. Even if \ntheir FIT rates are reasonably lo w, there are other electronics \nboards (e.g. gate drivers, controls hardware, etc.) which have \nhigher FIT rates (more prone to failure). One way to tackle \nthis issue is to provide redundancy inside the converter and \nthus effectively increase the availability of the system. Since \navailability is driven by time lost (see (2)) and, if due to the \nhigh part count, the mean time between failure (MTBF) is low \n(reliability is low or FIT rates are high) then by making the \nmean time to repair (MTTR) as short as possible, one can still \nmaintain a high availability. \nMTTRMTBF\nMTBFA +=                  ( 2 )  \nThis implies that the converter should be as modular as \npossible so that the faulty part  can be exchanged quickly. The \nphilosophy behind the operation of a modular PET is that with \nall cells installed in the system, (minimum number +1), in the \ncase of failure of any one cell, the faulty cell will be removed \n(bypassed) from the system. In this way, the system will \ncontinue operation with the remaining healthy cells. Note that \nwhile in operation with the minimum number of cells, the PET \nsystem can still deliver the full power to the output.  \nThe cost issue is difficult to describe in simple terms since \nit depends on many factors. In [14] a cost increase of around \n50% compared to the conventional technology, was reported. \nThis is not the whole story though, because a PET can provide \nmore efficient energy conversion compared to the \nconventional solution, and this is in the range of 2-4%. \nAdditionally the harmonic performance is improved when \ncompared with the low freque ncy transformer approach. If \nthis is provided in a smaller installed volume and with less \nweight than the conventional solutions, it creates further \nenergy savings potential besides an improvement in passenger \ncomfort, thus giving PET technology a strong potential in \nrailway applications. The potential savings due to improved \nefficiency can also partly offset  the higher cost of installation \nand for a clear understanding the total cost of ownership \n(TCO) must be considered. This issue is not simple and \nshould be studied in more deta il and will be addressed by the \nauthors in the future. \nV. C\nONCLUSION \nPower electronic transformers, providing a reduction in \nweight and volume accompanied by additional functionalities, \nare considered a viable soluti on for the replacement of bulky \nlow-frequency transformers. This is especially true for those \noperating from a 16⅔ Hz railway grid. Designing such a \nconverter system is not a straightforward task, and some of the \nchallenges that are reported in the literature are presented here \nin this paper. PET offers certain advantages over the \nconventional solution, such as a reduction of weight and \nvolume, improved efficiency and more control flexibility \ntowards grid disturbances. Functional properties of this kind \nof technology have been demonstrated previously by many \nauthors but still more integration work aiming at cost \nreduction is required before a first implementation will be \nseen on the market. In meantime, a great milestone has been \nachieved recently by successf ully commissioning and putting \ninto operation a world’s fi rst ever power electronic \ntransformer on a locomotive that is in regular service [25].  \n \nR\nEFERENCES \n[1] H.Meniken: “Stromrichtersystem mit wechsel-spannungs-zwischenkreis \nund seine anwendung in der traktionstechnik” PhD thesis, Fakultät für \nElektrotechnik, RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany, 1978. \n[2] S.Östlund: “A primary switched converter system for traction \napplications” PhD thesis, Royal Institute of Technology, KTH, \nStockholm, Sweden, 1992. \n[3] S.Östlund: “Reduction of transformer rated power and line current \nharmonics in a primary switched converter system for traction \napplications”, The 5\nth European Conf. on Power Electronics and \nApplications – EPE, Brighton, UK, 1993, pp. 112-119. \n[4] P.C.Kjaer, S.Norrga, S.Östlund: “A primary-switched line-side converter \nusing zero-voltage switching”, IEEE Trans. on Industry Applications , \nVol. 37, No. 6, 2001, pp. 1824-1831. \n[5] N.Hugo, P.Stefanutti, M.Pellerin, A.
