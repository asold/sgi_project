Sheikh-Jabbari 1\n1Institute for Studies in Theoretical Physics and Mathematics (IPM)\nP.O.Box 19395-5531, Tehran, Iran\n2Physics Department, University of Toronto, Toronto,\nOntario, Canada M5S 1A7\nahmad,mosaffa, jabbari@theory.ipm.ac.ir, omidsar@phys ics.utoronto.ca\nAbstract\nIn this paper we elaborate on the correspondence between the qu antum Hall\nsystem with ﬁlling factor equal to one and the N = 4 SYM theory in the 1/2\nBPS sector, previously mentioned in the [hep-th/0409174, 040911 5]. We show the\nequivalence of the two in various formulations of the quantum Hall ph ysics. We\npresent an extension of the noncommutative Chern-Simons Matrix theory which\ncontains independent degrees of freedom (ﬁelds) for particles an d quasiholes. The\nBPS conﬁgurations of our model, which is a model with explicit particle- quasihole\nsymmetry, are in one-to-one correspondence with the 1/2 BPS st ates in the N = 4\nSYM. Within our model we shed light on some less clear aspects of the p hysics of the\nN = 4 theory in the 1/2 BPS sector, like the giant dual-giant symmetry, stability of\nthe giant gravitons, and stringy exclusion principle and possible implica tions of the\n(fractional) quantum Hall eﬀect for the AdS/CFT correspondenc e.\n1 Introduction\nIn 1973 ’t Hooft showed that [1] all correlators of a U(N) gauge theory, including\nN = 4 D=4 Supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theory, admit a double expa nsion\nwhich can be arranged in powers of Ng2\nY M and 1 /N where the 1 /N expansion is\nencoding the topology of the corresponding Feynman diagrams, as we have in string\ntheory. This observation found a full realization within the celebrat ed AdS/CFT\nframework [2].\nIn the N = 4 U(N) SYM, there are speciﬁc sectors, i.e. set of operators, in which\nthe above double expansion reduces to a single expansion in powers o f 1 /N. The\noperators of this sector are chiral primaries (and their descenda nts) whose scaling\ndimension is exact and the gY M corrections are absent due to supersymmetry. In\nfact the large amount of supersymmetry removes any gY M , perturbative or non-\nperturbative, dependence in all the n-point functions of chiral primaries. The chiral\nprimary operators preserve 16 supersymmetries of the superco nformal algebra of the\nN = 4 SYM theory, PSU(2,2|4), and hence they all belong to the 1/2 BPS sector\nof the theory. As such 1/2 BPS sector provides us with a laborator y to concentrate\non the 1/N behavior and the combinatorics of the n-point functions.\nIn the 1/2 BPS sector, which will be our main focus in this paper, the N = 4\nU(N) SYM simpliﬁes signiﬁcantly and essentially becomes equivalent to a sys tem of\nN 2d fermions [3, 4]. These fermions are living in a speciﬁc sector of a 2d h armonic\noscillator potential. The 1/2 BPS condition restricts the dynamics of the system\nfurther down to a one dimensional N fermion system, with degenerate energy levels.\nThese facts will be reviewed and explained further in section 3.1.\nOne would try to explore the fermionic nature appearing in the analys is of the\n1/2 BPS sector in the dual gravity picture. This has been carried ou t in a novel\nwork by Lin-Lunin-Maldacena (LLM) [5]. LLM constructed type IIB s upergravity\nsolutions compatible with the supersymmetries preserved in the 1/2 BPS sector of\nN = 4 SYM; i.e. LLM found static, non-singulardeformations of AdS5×S5 geometry\npreserving at least 16 supercharges with SO(4) ×SO(4) ×U(1) ⊂SO(4,2) ×SO(6)\nisometries, the U(1) corresponding to translations along the globally deﬁned time-\nlike (or in special cases light-like) Killing vector. The solutions of LLM ar e only\ndetermined through a single function z, which is a function of three coordinates\nusually denoted by ( x1,x2) and a non-negative coordinate y, and z/y2 satisfy a six\ndimensional Laplace equation [5]. The LLM geometries are then comp letely speciﬁed\nby giving the value of the function z at y = 0. The smoothness condition forces\nz0(x1,x2) ≡z(x1,x2,y = 0) to take only values +1 /2 or −1/2, a very restrictive\nand strong condition. Hence, LLM made a one-to-one correspond ence between the\n1/2 BPS sectors of AdS5 ×S5 deformations and the fermionic description of the\nN = 4 SYM, by directly identifying ( x1,x2) plane with the phase space of the one\ndimensional fermions mentioned earlier. Explicitly this identiﬁcation imp lies that\n[x1,x2] = 2 πi l4\np , (1.1)\n1\nwhere lp is the ten dimensional Planck length. That is, the ( x1,x2) plane in the\ngeometry turns out to be a noncommutative Moyal plane, a result c oming from and\nconﬁrmed by the quantum gravity considerations (resulting via AdS /CFT from the\nN = 4 SYM description). To be precise and to make the above correspo ndence\nexact, LLM borrowed one fact from the semiclassical physics, nam ely quantization\nof the supergravity ﬁveform ﬂux. The smoothness condition z0 = ±1/2, is then\nclosely related to the Pauli exclusion principle in the fermion picture. L LM used\na convenient color coding: denote the z0 = −1/2 with black and z0 = +1 /2 with\nwhite. In the fermion picture, z0 −1/2 is the fermion density (in its phase space),\ni.e. black regions are ﬁlled with fermions and white regions are empty.\nThe system of 2d fermions moving in a constant background magnet ic ﬁeld has\nan interesting sector in which energy levels of fermions are degener ate and fermions\nare labeled by their angular momentum quantum number, the lowest L andau level\n(LLL). In the LLL the phase space of fermions is equivalent to the o ne we encoun-\ntered in the 1/2 BPS sector of N = 4 SYM. On the other hand (almost) all the\ninteresting physics of the Quantum Hall Eﬀect (QHE) can be describ ed in terms of\nLLL’s. Therefore, one should be able to build a dictionary between N = 4 SYM 1/2\nBPS operators (or LLM geometries) and the quantum Hall physics, within which\none can learn more about the N = 4 SYM and hence quantum gravity from QHE.\nThis is indeed what we are aiming for in this paper. Some preliminary step s in this\ndirection have been taken in [6].\nTo build the QHE/SYM correspondence we need to review, very brieﬂ y, the\nstandard descriptions of QHE. This is done in section 2, where we pre sent three\ndiﬀerent formulations for studying quantum Hall systems. In sect ion 3, we show\nhow the 1/2 BPS sector of SYM is directly mapped into either of the qu antum Hall\ndescriptions. We show this at the level of the actions and Hilbert spa ces. As has\nalso been mentioned in [6], we will see N = 4 SYM is a speciﬁc quantum Hall system\nwith ﬁlling factor ν = 1. We then focus on the quasiparticles of the corresponding\nquantum Hall system and argue that they are mapped to giant grav itons [7, 8] in\nthe gravity (gauge theory) picture.\nQuantum Hall system with ν = 1 has a particle/quasihole symmetry. In section\n4 we elaborate further on this issue. There we present an extensio n of the Chern-\nSimons matrix model action by promoting the quasiholes to new degre es of freedom,\nnew ﬁelds. That is we present an eﬀective ﬁeld theory consisting of t wo ﬁelds, one\nfor particles and one for quasiholes. The BPS solitons of our propos ed action exhibit\nparticle/quasihole symmetry. In section 4 we present several solu tions of these BPS\nequations and show that our BPS conﬁgurations are in one-to-one correspondence\nwith chiral primary operators of N = 4 SYM. Using our proposed action we study\nstability of its BPS solitons and show that classically there is no transit ion between\ngiant graviton states. The last section is devoted to discussions on our results and\nfurther extensions and generalizations of QHE/SYM corresponde nce.\n2\n2 Lightening Review of the Quantum Hall System\nInteger Quantum Hall eﬀect (IQHE) is simply quantization of the Hall conductance\nin e2/h units as σxy = νe2/h, where ν is an integer quantum number. This phe-\nnomenon is exhibited by condensed matter systems which can be app roximated as an\neﬀectively two dimensional ideal electron gas living in a strong magnet ic ﬁeld. Frac-\ntional values of the quantum number ν has also been observed. The corresponding\nHall eﬀect is called Fractional Quantum Hall eﬀect (FQHE). Fraction al and integer\nquantum hall eﬀects have two quite diﬀerent underlying physics. Ph ysics of the\nFQHE involves strong correlations among the electrons. Collective e xcitations of\nthe electron gas in the fractional case have fractional charges a nd statistics which is\nsomething between ordinary Bose and Fermi statistics. Quantum d escription of the\nHall system for ν−1 ∈Z is given by the so-called Laughlin wavefunction. Laugh-\nlin wave function encodes the edge ﬂuctuations of an incompressible gapless ﬂuid.\nThere also exists an algebraic approach to the Hall problem. The alge bra of the\narea preserving diﬀeomorphisms in two dimensions ( w∞ algebra) has been studied\nbefore e.g. see [17]. The quantum version of this algebra so called W1+∞ describes\nthe edge excitations of the Hall droplet. For more details refer to [ 15, 16].\nThere have been three diﬀerent approaches to quantum Hall syst em in the litera-\nture. The more standard one is based on quantum mechanics of som e non-relativistic\nfermions in an (strong) external magnetic ﬁeld in the Lowest Landa u Level (LLL)\n(for review see [14]) and second one is the eﬀective ﬁeld theory desc ription in terms\nof (noncommutative) Chern-Simons gauge theory [12]. The third on e is the Matrix\nChern-Simons theory which interpolates between the ﬁeld theory d escription and the\nquantum mechanical one. In this section we brieﬂy review these thr ee approaches.\n2.1 Landau problem and Quantum Hall eﬀect\nHere we study the Landau problem in two diﬀerent bases. This would e nable us to\ndraw an explicit connection between the Landau problem and the half BPS sector\nof the N =4 SYM.\nLet us start with a single non-relativistic charged particle moving in a t wo di-\nmensional plane transverse to a constant magnetic ﬁeld i.e., the Lan dau problem.\nThe Hamiltonian for the system is\nH = 1\n2m(pi −eB\n2cǫij xj )2 , (2.1)\nwhere i,j = 1 ,2 and xi,pi are the corresponding phase space conjugate variables\nand B is the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld. Next let Π i = pi −eB\n2c ǫij xj , it is then\nreadily seen that\n[Π 1,Π 2] = −iℏ eB\nc , (2.2)\n3\nand hence if we call Y1 = c\neB Π 2, [ Y1,Π 1] = iℏ, the Hamiltonian takes the form\nH = 1\n2m\n(\nΠ 2\n1 + ( eB\nc )2Y2\n1\n)\n, (2.3)\nwhich is the Hamiltonian for a simple one dimensional Harmonic oscillator w ith\nfrequency\nω0 = eB\nmc . (2.4)\nThe spectrum of the Hamiltonian is\nE = ℏω0(n+ 1\n2) . (2.5)\nNoting that J= ǫij xipj also commutes with the Hamiltonian the energy eigenstates\nare inﬁnitely degenerate and their degeneracy is labeled by J, eigenvalues of J, which\ncan be any arbitrary integer.\nNow, let us analyze the above Hamiltonian in another way. Expand the square\nto obtain\nH = 1\n2mp2 + e2B2\n8mc2 x2 + eB\n2mcǫij xipj . (2.6)\nThe ﬁrst two terms of the above Hamiltonian is the Hamiltonian for a tw o dimen-\nsional harmonic oscillator, H0, with frequency ω0/2. The spectrum of this part is\nE0 = 1\n2ℏω0(n+ n′ + 1) . (2.7)\nThe next part is proportional to the angular momentum which has th e spectrum\nJ = ℏ(n′ −n), where both n and n′ are non-negative integers. Putting these two\ncontributions together we obtain the spectrum of the whole Hamilto nian H to be\nexactly given by (2.5).\nThe lowest energy state, the lowest Landau level (LLL), is then giv en by n= 0\nbut arbitrary n′. In the lowest Landau level, ignoring the zero point energy, H0 is\nproportional to J, i.e.\nH0 −1\n2ℏω0 = 1\n2ℏω0J . (2.8)\nIn the lowest Landau level, which is known to describe the quantum Ha ll physics,\nthe Hamiltonian is essentially J, or the action corresponding to the system is\nS = eB\n2c\n∫\ndtǫij xi ˙xj . (2.9)\n4\n2.2 Fluid description of Quantum Hall eﬀect\nConsider a system of ﬁnite number of non-relativistic interacting pa rticles. A con-\ntinuum (ﬁeld theory) description of this ﬂuid is obtained by promoting the particle\nlabels to a continuous co-moving coordinate y. The real space density is given by\nρ= |∂y\n∂x|ρ0 , (2.10)\nwhere x is the real space position. It can be seen that if the ﬂuid is incompres sible\nthe corresponding continuum Lagrangian has a gauge invariance un der area pre-\nserving diﬀeomorphisms (APD) in the y plane [12]. Small ﬂuctuations around the\nstatic background solution xi = yi is closely connected to Electrodynamics if we\nparameterize these ﬂuctuations as\nxi = yi + ǫij\nAj\n2πρ0\n, (2.11)\nwhere A plays the role of electromagnetic vector potential.\nNow consider a ﬂuid with charged particles moving in a constant magne tic ﬁeld.\nThe Lagrangian acquires a new term induced by the background mag netic ﬁeld.\nThe APD’s would still keep the new action invariant and (2.10) can be re written as\n1 = 1\n2ǫij ǫab\n∂xb\n∂yj\n∂xa\n∂yi\n≡1\n2ǫab{xa,xb}P.B. . (2.12)\nIn the strong magnetic ﬁeld limit the action is basically dominated by the magnetic\nﬁeld term (setting c= 1), i.e.\nS = eBρ0\n2\n∫\ndtd2yǫabxa ˙xb .\n(Dropping other terms in the action is equivalent to restricting to low est Landau\nlevel.) In this limit the equation of motion and the constraint can be enc apsulated\nin a single action via introducing a non-dynamical time component of A, A0:\nL= eBρ0\n2 ǫab\n∫\nd2y[( ˙Xa − 1\n2πρ0\n{Xa,A0})Xb + ǫab\n2πρ0\nA0] , (2.13)\nwhere the bracket is the Poisson bracket deﬁned in (2.12).\nThis theory admits vortex solutions. Chern-Simons vortex is basica lly radial\ndisturbance of the ﬂuid toward or away from the center of the vor tex proportional\nto the q/r where q is related to the excess or deﬁcit charge of the vortex by\neqp = ρ0qe , (2.14)\nand r measures the distance from the center of the vortex. These are quasihole\nor quasiparticle states of the Hall ﬂuid in the continuum description. Semiclassical\nquantization of this theory implies that [12]\neqp = 2 πρ0\nB = νe , (2.15)\n5\nwhere ν = 2πρ0\neB is the ﬁlling fraction. Filling fraction is the ratio of the number of\nthe electrons to the magnetic ﬂux (that is, inverse of magnetic ﬂux per particle).\nFull quantization of the theory gives rise to quantization of the ν inverse. Filling\nfraction also controls statistics of the collective excitations of the ﬂuid.\n2.3 NC Chern-Simons Matrix model description of QHE\nAPD’s (or w∞ algebra), which reﬂect symmetry of the system under relabeling of\nthe particles in an incompressible ﬂuid, translate into the gauge symm etries of the\ncontinuum theory. A gauge theory based on this gauge invariance w ould be able\nto capture some long distance physics but it is unable of incorporatin g the intrinsic\ngranular structure of the ﬂuid. It turns out that a description of the system which\nis more faithful to the underlying discrete physics is a matrix model d escription of\nthe ﬂuid. In this description classical conﬁguration of the N number of electrons\nis replaced by the space of N ×N Hermitian matrices. The action (2.13) can be\ngeneralized to a matrix theory [12]\nL= eB\n2 ǫabTr( ˙Xa −i[Xa,A0])Xb + eBθTrA0 , (2.16)\nwhere θ = 1 /(2πρ0) plays the role of the noncommutativity parameter. In this\naction the APD’s are replaced by the U(N) gauge symmetry. Constraint equation\nis obtained by varying this action with respect to A0\n[Xa,Xb] = iθǫab . (2.17)\nAlthough we started with a ﬁnite N, due to antisymmetric nature of the com-\nmutator,(2.17) can only be solved for inﬁnite size matrices. Therefo re, the model\ndescribes “inﬁnite” number of particles. We will return to this point m omentarily.\nIt is worth emphasizing that there are two diﬀerent kinds of noncom mutativity\nnot to be confused with each other. One of them is controlled by 1 /(eB) and has a\nquantum mechanical origin; X1 and X2 are canonically conjugate and hence do not\ncommute as quantum operators, i.e.\n[ ˆX1, ˆX2]opt. = i\neB .\nThe second one is encoding the APD invariance of the theory (in the c ontinuum case)\nor its permutation subgroup (in the discrete case i.e. the matrix mod el description).\nThe latter noncommutativity is controlled by θ= 1 /(2πρ0)\n[X1,X2]Mat. = iθ .\nStatistics of the Chern-Simons particles is determined by the ﬁlling fr action ν.\nThe ratio of the two noncommutativities, ν−1 = eBθ is ought to be an integer\nif we demand the action (2.16) to be invariant under large gauge tran sformations\n6\n[18]. It can be shown that there is a density-statistics connection; depending on\nν = 1 /(2n+ 1) or ν = 1 /(2n) for integer n, the Hall ﬂuid excitations are either\nFermions or Bosons.\nAt this point it is instructive to pause for a moment and make a compar ison\nwith the N=4 SYM theory in its half BPS sector. It is rather clear that the above\nmentioned matrix model cannot have an origin as a particular sector of a “ﬁnite”\nN (U(N) is the gauge group) SYM theory. It is impossible to satisfy the APD\ninvariance constraint by means of ﬁnite dimensional matrices as of ﬁ nite N N=4\nSYM theory. As it was explained earlier the same problem occurs if one is to write\na matrix model for a Hall system with ﬁnite number of particles.\nMatrix model for Hall systems with ﬁnite number of particles has bee n discussed\nin [13]. Finite N matrix models can be constructed by introducing new degrees of\nfreedom so-called edge states. In the presence of the edge stat e commutator gets\nmodiﬁed. This anomaly provides the opportunity to satisfy the APD in variance\nconstraint by ﬁnite N matrices. Now we proceed to review some general aspects of\nthe ﬁnite N Chern-Simons matrix model.\n2.4 Finite dimensional NC Chern-Simons Matrix models\nThe starting point is to modify the action (2.16) with extra degrees o f freedom called\nedge state [13]\nL= B\n2 Trǫab( ˙Xa + i[A0,Xa])Xb + BθA0 + BΨ †(i˙Ψ −A0Ψ) −1\n2ω2(Xa)2, (2.18)\nwhere Ψ, the edge state, is a complex valued vector ﬁeld in the funda mental of\nthe U(N) gauge group and we have set e = 1. The X2 term has been added to\nmake a droplet the lowest energy state [13] and setting ω= 0 (2.18) reduces to NC\nChern-Simons Matrix model. The constraint gets modiﬁed as follows\n−i[X1,X2] + ΨΨ † −θ= 0 . (2.19)\nTaking the trace would not lead to any inconsistency instead it gives\nΨ †Ψ = Nθ . (2.20)\nUsing equation of motion for Ψ in temporal gauge, one obtains\nΨ =\n√\nθN|v⟩, (2.21)\nwhere |v⟩is an arbitrary constant unit vector. The constraint (2.19) now re ads\n[A,A†] = 2 θ(1 −N|v⟩⟨v|) , (2.22)\nwhere\nA= X1 + iX2 . (2.23)\n7\nThere are various ﬁnite dimensional solutions to the above constra int equation cor-\nresponding to diﬀerent Hall states. For instance\nA =\nN−1∑\nn=0\n√\n2nθ|n−1⟩⟨n|, (2.24)\n|v⟩ = |N −1⟩, (2.25)\nwhere (2.25) is only a freedom in gauge choice originating from the time independent\npart of the U(N) gauge invariance of the theory, is a solution representing a circula r\nquantum Hall droplet of radius\n√\n2Nθ. |m⟩is a harmonic oscillator basis. The\nradius-squared matrix coordinate R2 = X2\n1 + X2\n2 = A†Ais diagonal in the harmonic\nbasis and its highest eigenvalue goes like Nθ which suggests that we are talking\nabout a ﬁnite size quantum Hall state or Hall droplet [13]. There are other types of\nexcitations which will be of our interest later on: quasihole states. Q uasihole states\nwith charge −q at the origin satisfying (2.19) can be constructed as well\nA=\n√\n2θ(√q|N −1⟩⟨0|+\nN−1∑\nn=1\n√n+ q|n−1⟩⟨n|) . (2.26)\nLooking at R2 eigenvalues reveals that the lowest eigenvalue is proportional to 2 θq.\nThis means that there is a circular hole of area proportional to 2 θq at the origin.\nOf course the radius of the droplet itself has also changed to take c are of the total\nnumber of the particles inside the droplet which is ﬁxed to be N. There are no\nquasiparticle excitations (accumulation of the particles) in this mode l.\n3 Building the SYM/Quantum Hall Dictionary\nIn the previous section we reviewed various approaches to quantu m Hall problem\nand made connections between them. In this section we show that h ow N = 4 U(N)\nSYM theory, in the 1/2 BPS sector, is related to quantum Hall proble m and each\nof the above approaches. This will be done ﬁrst at the level of the c orresponding\nactions and then by relating the 1/2 BPS SYM operators and the qua ntum Hall\nstates. We also brieﬂy discuss the gravity picture via AdS/CFT dualit y.\n3.1 Eﬀective action in the 1/2 BPS sector\nLet us start with the N = 4 U(N) SYM action on R×S3 and denote one of the\nthree complex scalars present in the N = 4 gauge multiplet by Z. In the 1/2 BPS\nsector the operators can only be made out of Z and moreover these operators cannot\nhave non-trivial dependence on the S3. In the 1/2 BPS sector we should preserve\nSO(4) ×SO(4) ×U(1) ⊂SO(4,2) ×SO(6)R of the theory and are only allowed to\nperturb the theory by chiral primary operators, i.e. operators o nly made out of Z\n8\nand not Z† or any other ﬁelds [3, 4]. Therefore, the action relevant to this sec tor is\nsimply\nSreduced = 1\n2\n∫\ndt Tr\n(\n(D0Z)†D0Z−Z†Z−1\n2[Z,Z†]2\n)\n, (3.1)\nwhere we have used the conformal invariance of the theory and ch osen the radius\nof the S3 such that there are no prefactors in the action and we have also re scaled\nt,Z,A 0 such that they are all dimensionless. The above action, ignoring the last\nterm, is the action for N2 uncoupled two dimensional harmonic oscillators with\nfrequency one. One should, however, remember that not all the e lements of the\nN ×N matrices are independent and dynamical, as they may be related by t he\nU(N) gauge transformations. We will come back to the issue of gauge ﬁx ing later\non in this section.\nThe Dilatation operator in the sector containing operators only mad e out of Z\nand Z†, in the ﬁrst lowest order in g2\nY M is of the form: 1\nD = Tr\n(\nZ δ\nδZ\n)\n+ Tr\n(\nZ† δ\nδZ†\n)\n. (3.2)\nIn the same sector the R-charge J is measured by\nJ = Tr\n(\nZ δ\nδZ\n)\n−Tr\n(\nZ† δ\nδZ†\n)\n. (3.3)\nNote that (3.2) is nothing but the Hamiltonian for N2 2d harmonic oscillators\nwith the same frequency. In the 1/2 BPS sector D −J = 0 and hence in this sector\nD = Tr\n(\nZ δ\nδZ\n)\n. (3.4)\n(In this sector we are dealing with the operators which are only made out of Z.)\nIn the 1/2 BPS sector there is no gY M dependence in the scaling dimensions of the\noperators and hence the dilatation operator (3.2) is exact. As it is m anifest in the\n1/2 BPS sector we are only left with an eﬀectively one dimensional sys tem out of\nthe 2d harmonic oscillator system we started with.\nδ\nδZ is the momentum conjugate to Z, Π Z . On the other hand from the N = 4\nSYM action, in the temporal gauge, we have Π Z = ˙Z†. Therefore, the action for a\nsystem with the Hamiltonian D −J(= 0) in the BPS sector is simply\nS1/2 BP S = i\n2\n∫\ndt Tr\n(\nZ† ˙Z−( ˙Z)†Z\n)\n. (3.5)\nIt is very instructive to compare the above discussions and formula e with those\nof sections 2.1 and 2.4. In terms of quantities in section 2.1, it is explicit ly seen that\n1It is worth noting that the D-term [ Z,Z †]2 in the action (3.1) does not contribute to the\ndilatation operator.\n9\nthe two are related by\nD ↔H0 −ℏω0/2\nJ ↔J\nD −J ↔H\n(3.6)\nHence D −J is the Hamiltonian of N fermions (see the arguments below) in the\nexternal magnetic ﬁeld and it is seen that going to LLL corresponds to taking the\nBPS states for which D −J vanishes.\nThe action (3.5), with N×N matrices, is equivalent to the Polychronakos ﬁnite\nN matrix Chern-Simons theory discussed in section 2.4 after ﬁxing the temporal\ngauge A0 = 0 and replacing the edge state Ψ with the speciﬁc classical solution\ngiven in (2.21). For the equivalence, however, one should still impose the constraint\n(2.19).\nSo far we have established the relation between the quantum Hall sy stem and\nthe 1/2 BPS sector of N = 4 SYM at classical level, i.e. at the level of the actions.\nAs the next step we would like to push this further to the level of par tition function.\nExplicitly, we want to show that the partition function of the N = 4 U(N) SYM in\nthe 1/2 BPS sector is producing the “Laughlin” wavefunction [14], th at is\nZ1/2 BP S =\n∫ (\nDZD ¯Z|1/2 BP S\n)\ne−S1/ 2 BP S = ⟨ψL|ψL⟩, (3.7)\nwith\nψL =\nN∏\ni>j=1\n(zi −zj ) e− ∑ N\ni=1 ¯zizi/2 , (3.8)\nwhere zi,¯zi i= 1 ,2,··· ,N are the eigenvalues of the N×N matrices of U(N) N = 4\nSYM, Z, ¯Z. To show this we need to use the U(N) gauge symmetry to diagonalize\nZ. We ﬁx the temporal gauge A0 = 0 and use the remaining time independent\n(global) gauge transformations to diagonalize Z. This, however, is not possible\nwith a single U(N), as Z is a complex (non-hermitian) N ×N matrix. In order to\ndiagonalize Z we need to double U(N) to U(N) ×U(N) or to complexify U(N) to\nU(N,C). Since we are going to reduce the computations to 1/2 BPS sector indeed\nwe can use this extended gauge group. To see this it is more convenie nt to use the\nHamiltonian path integral with measure DZD ¯ZDΠ Z DΠ ¯Z. In the 1/2 BPS sector,\nhowever, Π Z = i¯Z and Π ¯Z = −iZ. This means that in order to do computations\nwith the path integral in the 1/2 BPS sector in the process of the ga uge ﬁxing we\nneed to divide the measure by VolU(N) ×VolU(N). This justiﬁes eﬀective extension\nof the gauge group needed for diagonalizing Z. The rest of the computations are\nthe standard Van der Monde determinant techniques [21] leading to\nDZD ¯Z|1/2 BP S =\nN∏\ni>j=1\n(zi −zj)\nN∏\ni>j=1\n(¯zi −¯zj)\nN∏\ni=1\ndzid¯zi .\n10\nThe Lagrangian in the 1/2 BPS sector, for diagonalized Z simply reduces to∑ N\ni=1 ¯zizi. This proves the statements made in (3.7), (3.8).\nAs the ﬁrst outcome of the above discussion, we note that the 1/2 BPS sector of\nN = 4 SYM is equivalent to a Laughlin wavefunction with ν = 1. 2 This observation\nhas also been made in [6]. For ν = 1 the wavefunction is antisymmetric with respect\nto exchange of any two zi,zj and hence the eigenvalues of Z are describing positions\nof N fermions in the lowest Landau level (LLL).\nNext, we note the important property of the wavefunctions of th e system of N\nparticles in the LLL: the wavefunction can be written as\nψLLL = f(zi) e− ∑ N\ni=1 ¯zizi/2 ,\nwhere f, regardless of the statistics of the underlying particles and its sym metry\nbehavior under exchange of zi’s, is a holomorphic function of z’s [14]. This holo-\nmorphicity is then directly related to the fact that the chiral primar ies (1/2 BPS\noperators of N = 4 SYM) are holomorphic in Z.\nFinally, as reviewed in section 2.1, in the Landau problem the coordinat es of\nthe 2d particles become noncommutative [14] and in the LLL particle s essentially\nbecome one dimensional. In other words the ( zi,¯zi) plane becomes the phase space\nof the particles [14, 3] and hence (in proper units) [ zi,¯zj] = δij . As reviewed brieﬂy\nin the introduction, this has become manifest in the LLM setup [5].\nThe emergence of an integer Hall system from the 1/2 BPS sector o f SYM ﬁnds\na simple interpretation within the geometric description of this secto r via LLM. As\nreviewed in the introduction, the smoothness condition for these g eometries allows\nfor only two boundary conditions for the function z0 on the noncommutative plane\n(zi,¯zi). In terms of LLM’s color coding, this means that the minimal area ac cessible\nto the black regions is the same as the one for the white regions. Alte rnatively one\ncan say that the absence of a minimal black spot corresponds to th e presence of a\nminimal white spot. On the other hand, for a QHS with ν ≡1/k (with integer k),\nthe minimal area accessible to a particle is k times as that for a hole. As a result,\nthe density of particles can acquire k+1 diﬀerent values or alternatively the absence\nof a particle is equivalent to the presence of k holes. The two pictures can thus be\nrelated to one another only if k= 1.\nTherefore, N = 4 SYM in the 1/2 BPS sector is describing the same physics as\na quantum Hall system with ν = 1 and with a speciﬁc edge state. In what follows\nwe elaborate further on the connection and relation of the two sys tems.\n2The Laughlin wavefunction for a quantum Hall system with ﬁlling fract ion ν is [14]\nψLaughlin =\nN∏\ni>j=1\n(zi −zj )\n1\nν e− ∑ N\ni=1 ¯zizi/2 .\n11\n3.2 QH solutions Vs. SYM operators\nIn this section we explore the correspondence between the 1/2 BP S operators of\nN = 4 SYM and the physical states of an integer QHS. Dealing with a U(N) gauge\ntheory with deﬁnite N calls for a QHS with a ﬁnite number of particles which is\nprovided by the Polychronakos’ construction [13].\nLet us ﬁrst review the physical states of a ﬁnite QHS with arbitrary ν (we will\nlater focus on ν = 1). The physical states of this system can be found by quantizing\nthe corresponding matrix model (2.18) which results in the quantum Calogero model\nwith the following Hamiltonian (we take ω= B = 1) [19, 13, 20]\nH = 1\n2\nN∑\nn=1\n(p2\nn + x2\nn) +\n∑\nn̸=m\nk(k−1)\n(xn −xm)2 , (3.9)\nwhere ν = 1 /k (note that for k = 1 the second sum vanishes). The eigenstates\nof this system are well known and are given by N positive integers ( f1,f2,...,f N )\n(known as quasinumbers) such that fi + 1 > fi+1 + k. The ground state of the\nQHS, |0⟩QH,k, is given by fi = k(N −i) and its energy will be 1\n2 (kN2 + N(1 −k)).\nFor future use we express the states in terms of their excitations above the ground\nstate by the nonnegative integers ( r1,r2,··· ,rN ) where ri = fi −k(N −i) such\nthat r1 ≥ r2 ≥ ··· ≥rN ≥ 0. As explained in [13], these states describe N\nindependent harmonic oscillators with an enhanced exclusion principle such that\nany two occupied states can not be closer than k. For k= 1, the particles will thus\nbe ordinary fermions.\nOne can, on the other hand, ﬁnd the states of N = 4 SYM in the 1/2 BPS\nsector. In [3, 4], these states have been found by quantizing a one matrix model\nwith a harmonic oscillator potential with unit frequency. As describe d in this paper,\ndiﬀerent gauge ﬁxings for the model result in diﬀerent bases for th e spectrum. The\nﬁrst one, trace basis, consists of N2 free bosonic harmonic oscillators subject to\nthe constraint that the states must be neutral under gauge tra nsformations. These\nstates are expressed in terms of a set of positive integers ( c1,c2,··· ) such that N ≥\nc1 ≥c2 ≥ ···. Each number n in this set is attributed to a creation operator\nβ†\nn which acts on the gauge invariant vacuum |0⟩tr. The ground state energy for\nthe vacuum will thus be N2/2. The upper bound on ci comes from the fact that\noperators with n>N are not independent.\nA second gauge choice, eigenvalue basis, leads to a system of N free fermionic os-\ncillators. The states are expressed in terms of N nonnegative integers ( f1,f2,...,f N )\nsuch that f1 >f2 >··· >fN . The ground state, |0⟩EV , is given by fi = N −i and\nits energy will be ∑ N−1\nn=0 (n+ 1/2) = N2/2. It is more convenient to write the states\nin terms of nonnegative integers which represent the excitations a bove the ground\nstate ( r1,r2,··· ,rN ) where ri = fi −(N −i) such that r1 ≥r2 ≥···≥ rN ≥0. It\nwas shown in [3] that the above two bases are related by the Schur p olynomial basis\nand the two descriptions are identical. There is then a one-to-one c orrespondence\nbetween the fermionic occupation indices fi’s (or ri’s) and the bosonic harmonic\n12\noscillator ci’s. The map between the two is basically given by the bosonization\nof the 2d fermion system. (This point has been discussed in a recent paper [22].)\nOne may also use the diﬀerence of two successive ri’s for labeling the states, i.e.\n(w1,w2,··· ,wN ), where wi = ri−1 −ri for 1 < i < Nand wN = rN . In the Young\ntableau notation the wi labeling corresponds to the Dynkin labels, see Fig. 1.\nr1\nr2\nr3\nc1 ci\nb1\nb2\nb3\nbn\nc2 c3\nw1\nw2\nw3\nrN\nrj\nwN\nFigure 1: A generic Young tableau is in one-to-one correspondence with an LLM\nconﬁguration of black and white circular rings, which is also equivalent to a similar\nconﬁguration of quantum Hall droplets. There are various ways to label a Young\ntableau, each suitable for a diﬀerent interpretation in the quantum Hall system. For\nexample one can identify a tableau by the length of its rows ( ri’s) or length of its\ncolumns ( ci’s) or the Dynkin labels, ( b1,w1; b2,w2; b3,w3; ...; bn,wn) ( bi is counting\nthe number of zeros in the standard Dynkin labels). The latter direc tly correspond\nto the area of black and white regions in the quantum Hall droplet pict ure. The ri’s\nand ci’s are related by bosonization of 2d fermion system.\nWe now have all the ingredients to relate ﬁnite QHS to the 1/2 BPS sec tor of\nthe gauge theory. This relation is most apparent when we use the eig envalue basis\nfor the latter. In this basis, it is immediately seen that the two descr iptions are\nidentical if and only if k = 1. It is an interesting and curious question whether one\ncan ﬁnd deformations or perhaps other sectors of SYM which could be described\nby fractional QHS i.e. with k ̸= 1. We will address this question in the discussion\nsection.\nRestricting to k = 1, consider for example the ground state |0⟩QH,1. This is a\ncircular droplet with radius R ∼\n√\nN and maps to the ground state of the gauge\n13\ntheory or |0⟩EV ≡|0⟩tr which in turn corresponds to the AdS5 ×S5 background with\nR2\nAdS ∼\n√\nN. The minimal excitation of the particle system amounts to exciting th e\nparticle at the edge of the droplet to the state |N⟩which produces a circular hole\nstate near the edge of the droplet. In the eigenvalue basis this is th e state (1 ,0,..., 0)\nand in the trace basis it is produced by β†\n1|0⟩tr. The corresponding geometry is an\nAdS5 ×S5 with a smeared giant very close to the equator of S5. As another example,\na hole in the origin of the droplet, (1 ,1,..., 1), is identical to β†\nN |0⟩tr and corresponds\nto the largest giant on the pole of S5. A hole of unit area in a generic point in the\nquantum Hall droplet, which is described by a coherent state in the q uantum Hall\nlanguage, corresponds to a localized giant graviton the radius squa red of which is\nproportional to its distance from the edge of the droplet.\n4 Quasiholes in the N = 4 SYM\nIn this section we attribute independent physical degrees of free dom to the hole\nstates of QHS by considering them as the excitations of a dynamical ﬁeld which we\ndenote by Φ. In this way, the hole states are put on the same footin g as the particles\nand the duality between these states is promoted to a dynamical on e.\nThere are several motivations why one would like to treat the two diﬀ erent\nexcitations (particles Vs. holes) symmetrically. A strong one comes from the gravity\ndescription of QHS in the LLL with unit ﬁlling fraction ( ν = 1) which is given by\nthe half BPS geometries (LLM solutions) of type IIB SUGRA. (This po int has ﬁrst\nbeen discussed in [23].) In fact, for these geometries the above me ntioned duality is\nenhanced to a symmetry which manifests itself through the invarian ce of solutions\nunder the interchange of black and white boundary conditions, acc ompanied by a\nchange of orientation on the plane ( x1,x2). This enhancement occurs because for\nν = 1 the statistics of particles, given by ν, is the same as that for the holes, given by\n1/ν, and both are fermions. Furthermore, the symmetry requires th e same absolute\nvalue for the charge units of particles and holes which holds only when ν = 1.\nFrom the quantum Hall physics side, adding new degrees of freedom has been\nconsidered in order to accommodate quasiparticles as well as quasih oles. The latter,\nas we reviewed in section 2.4, can be achieved via the edge state ( cf. (2.26)).\nQuasiparticle states, however, were obtained within the model intr oduced in [24] in\nthe context of commutative Chern-Simons model and then in [25, 2 6] extended to\nthe noncommutative Chern-Simons.\n4.1 Particle-Hole Lagrangian\nTo construct a symmetric model we introduce a new dynamical ﬁeld Φ , in addition\nto Z, in the NCCS matrix theory and interpret the excitations of this ﬁeld as the\nhole states. We choose Φ as an inﬁnite dimensional complex matrix whic h is in the\nadjoint of the gauge group. The important point is that although we are dealing with\n14\nan inﬁnite four matrix theory, as we will see, one can ﬁnd solutions to this theory\nwhich represent ﬁnite particle/hole systems. Therefore the gaug e group dimension\nin the particle/hole sector of the system comes up as a part of the s olution rather\nthan as an input parameter.\nLet us start with the NCCS matrix model Lagrangian we presented in section\n2.3\nLCS = −πκ\nθ Tr\n(\n−ǫij Xi( ˙Xj + i[A0,Xj]) + 2 θA0\n)\n, (4.1)\nwhere in terms of external magnetic B ﬁeld applied to QH liquid in the unit of\nelectric charge\n2πκ= Bθ = 1\nν , (4.2)\nand ν is the ﬁlling fraction. If we expand the covariant position operator Xi around\nthe solutions of the equation of motion for A0, [ Xi,Xj] = iθǫij , in terms of the\ncomoving coordinates yi’s as\nXi ≡yi + θǫij Aj , (4.3)\nwith [ yi,yj] = iθǫij , (4.1) then reduces to noncommutative Chern-Simons (NCCS)\naction in 2+1 dimensions [12, 25]. In this notation\nDiΦ ≡∂iΦ + i[Ai,Φ]\n= i\nθǫij [Xj,Φ] ,\n(4.4)\nwhere Φ is an arbitrary matrix which can also be thought of as a ﬁeld in t he adjoint\nrepresentation of NC U(1).\nTo incorporate holes as independent dynamical degrees of freedo m we add a\nnon-relativistic matter ﬁeld Φ to the action (4.1):\nLZ−Φ = −πκ\nθ Tr\n(\ni(Z†D0Z−(D0Z)†Z) + 2 θA0\n)\n+πκ\nθ Tr\n(\ni(Φ †D0Φ −(D0Φ) †Φ) − 1\n2mDiΦ( DiΦ) † −V(Φ)\n)\n, (4.5)\nwhere Z = 1√\n2 (X1 + iX2) and D0Z = ∂0Z+ i[A0,Z] (and similarly for Φ). m is the\neﬀective mass for the Φ particle and we choose the potential V(Φ) to be\nV(Φ) = − 1\n2mθ2\n(\n[Φ ,Φ †] + θ\n2\n) 2\n. (4.6)\nThe action (4.5) is an extension of the noncommutative version of Du nne-Jackiw-\nPi-Trugenberger model [24], discussed in [26]. Note that, unlike [25], in our action\nΦ is in the adjoint ( cf. (4.4)).\n15\nIt is instructive to compare our Φ ﬁeld with the edge state Ψ introduc ed in\nsection 2.4. The Φ ﬁeld being an N ×N matrix, rather than an N vector, may be\nthought of as a collection of N number of edge states. In the classical analysis of\nthe Polykronachos’ model [13] with one edge state we could only des cribe a single\ndroplet (which may have a hole in it cf. (2.26)). In order to describe two droplets,\nor generically multi-droplets, such as multi concentric rings in Fig 1, classically we\nneed to introduce an edge state for each droplet. At quantum leve l, i.e. in Calogero\nmodel, quantum ﬂuctuations of a single edge state, however, allows describing multi\ndroplets. From the APD symmetry viewpoint this can be understood noting that\nAPD’s at classical level ( w∞ transformations) does not relate conﬁgurations with\ndiﬀerent number of rings while at quantum level ( W∞+1 transformations) can tear\nthe edge of a droplet apart and hence relate a single droplet to two d roplets with\nthe same area. In other words, the edge states corresponding t o diﬀerent number of\nrings belong to topologically distinct sectors of the gauge orbits of N C U(1) in the\nNCCS theory or U(N) in the Chern-Simons Matrix theory (4.1). In this viewpoint\nour model which classically contains the multi edge state ﬁeld Φ, is an eﬀective ﬁeld\ntheory description of the quantum version of the Polychronakos m odel (the Calogero\nmodel).\nBefore proceeding with the analysis of the action (4.5), let us motiva te the po-\ntential term (4.6). As we have implicitly seen and would be discussed fu rther in the\nfollowing section, the Φ (and Φ †) ﬁeld corresponds to giant (anti-giant) gravitons in\nthe gravity picture and V(Φ) is representing the giant-antigiant force and hence the\npotential (4.6) is a tachyonic potential corresponding to the open string tachyon in\nthe giant-antigiant system. To ﬁrst order in α′ this potential can be obtained from\nthe expansion of a Born-Infeld action. (Note that potential (4.6) , up to integrals of\ntotal derivatives and a shift in zero point energy, is proportional t o −Tr([Φ ,Φ †]2).)\nWe start the analysis with the equation of motion for A0, the Gauss law constraint\n[Z,Z†] −[Φ ,Φ †] = θ . (4.7)\nComparing (4.7) with (1.1), it is convenient to choose θ= 2 πl4\np and mθ= lp and use\nthe units in which Z and Φ are both measured in units of\n√\nθ, ∂0 and A0 in units of\n1/lp. As discussed earlier, in the 1/2 BPS sector of N = 4 SYM we can only realize\na quantum Hall system with ν = 1 and hence we set 2 πκ= 1.\nIn the following we will show that this Lagrangain admits BPS (solitonic) solu-\ntions. In order to do that we begin with the Hamiltonian\nH = 1\n2θ\n[ 1\n2mθ2 Tr([Z,Z†][Φ ,Φ †] −2[Z†,Φ †][Z,Φ]) + TrV (Φ)\n]\n. (4.8)\nRecalling the form of the potential (4.6), and using the Gauss law con straint (4.7),\nit is readily seen that\n[Z,Φ] = 0 (4.9)\n16\nappears as the BPS condition. We should stress that to obtain a BPS conﬁguration\n(4.9) should be solved together with (4.7). 3 From the equations of motion for Z, it\nis inferred that for the static BPS conﬁgurations\nA0 = 1\n4mθ2\n(\n[Φ ,Φ †] + θ\n2\n)\n= 1\n4mθ2\n(\n[Z,Z†] −θ\n2\n)\n. (4.10)\nIn the second equality we have used the Gauss law constraint (4.7). For the BPS\nconﬁgurations the Hamiltonian (4.8) becomes a constant and\n[Z+ Φ †,(Z+ Φ †)†] = θ . (4.11)\nThe action evaluated on a BPS conﬁguration is\nLBP S\nZ−Φ = −i\n2θ\n(\nZ†∂0Z−(∂0Z)†Z−Φ †∂0Φ + ( ∂0Φ) †Φ\n)\n.\nΦ ﬁelds which solve the BPS equation (4.9), if we treat Φ as a function o f Z\nand Z†, are all holomorphic functions of Z. This fact can directly be connected\nwith the holomorphicity of the chiral primary operators in N = 4 SYM and/or the\nholomorphicity of the wavefunctions describing a quantum Hall syst em in the lowest\nLandau level (i.e. Laughlin wavefunction). In other words, the BPS conﬁgurations\nof the action we have proposed are satisfying the same condition as the (half) BPS\nconﬁgurations of the N = 4 SYM. It is worth noting that, as seen from (4.7), the\nclassical solutions, BPS or non-BPS, to the Z-Φ model are all inﬁnite size matrices.\n4.2 Static solitonic BPS solutions\nIn this section we ﬁnd some static classical solutions to the BPS equa tions derived\nfrom Lagrangian (4.5). The BPS conﬁgurations can be represente d by the color\ncoding: black region for the particles, where [ Z,Z†] is non-zero, and white region\nfor quasiholes, where [Φ ,Φ †] is non-vanishing.\nI. Vacuum\nAs the ﬁrst solution we consider the vacuum. This can be chosen to b e either the\nparticle vacuum (black plane) or the hole one (white plane). Let’s cho ose the latter\nfor which the solution is simply given by\nZ = 0 , Φ =\n∞∑\nn=1\n√\nnθ|n⟩⟨n−1|. (4.12)\n3As has been discussed in [26], BPS solitonic equations (4.7), (4.9) can b e obtained from a\nnoncommutative version of 2d chiral model. The reduction from (2 + 1) dim. to 2d may be\nunderstood noting that BPS solitons are time independent. In [26] it has also been argued that\nnoncommutative 2d chiral model is solvable and the moduli space of t he solutions is trivial.\n17\nThis solution for Φ can be interpreted as an in ﬁnite number of concen tric annular\nrings with unit area around the origin. The inner and outer radii of th e ring n, Ri(n)\nand Ro(n), can be determined by\nRo\n2\n(n) = θ⟨n|Φ †\nn+1Φ n+1|n⟩,Ri\n2\n(n) = θ⟨n|Φ nΦ †\nn|n⟩, (4.13)\nwhere\nΦ n ≡\n√\nnθ|n⟩⟨n−1|, n = 1 ,2,··· (4.14)\nsuch that Ro(n−1) = Ri(n) =\n√\nnθ. The Gauss law constraint implies that\nRo\n2\n(n) = θ+ Ri\n2\n(n) . (4.15)\nII. Black circular droplet\nA black circular droplet is speciﬁed by the following solution\nZ =\n√\nθ\nN∑\nn=1\n√n|n−1⟩⟨n|,\nΦ =\n√\nθ\n∞∑\nn=N+1\n√n|n⟩⟨n−1|.\n(4.16)\nHere, the ring N has its inner radius inside the particles and its outer radius inside\nthe holes. One can see that there is an anomaly in [ Z,Z†] in the |N⟩⟨N|component\nwhich is removed by Φ †\nN+1Φ N+1. Comparing this to the ﬁnite matrix model of\nPolychronakos, it is obvious that Φ †\nN+1Φ N+1 is behaving as ΨΨ † where Ψ is the\nedge state. Therefore the edge state for the particle sector is p rovided by the hole\ndegrees of freedom. Alternatively, an edge state for the hole sec tor is provided by\nthe particle degrees of freedom through the term Z†\nN ZN . This will be discussed\nfurther in section 4.3.\nFigure 2: A circular droplet\nIII. White rings inside a black circular droplet\nAs the next example we present the solution corresponding to a blac k circular droplet\nwith a concentric white ring inside as depicted in Fig. 3.\n18\nFigure 3: A circular droplet with a white ring. The area of the inner blac k disk is k1,\nthe white ring k2 and the outer black ring k3. This BPS solitonic conﬁguration of\nour Z-Φ model corresponds to k2 smeared S5-giant gravitons in a U(k1 + k3) gauge\ntheory or alternatively to k3 smeared AdS-giants in a U(k1) gauge theory.\nThe solution is given by\nZ =\n√\nθ\n( k1∑\nn=1\n√n|n−1⟩⟨n|+\nq+k3∑\nn=q+1\n√n|n−1⟩⟨n|\n)\n,\n(4.17)\nΦ =\n√\nθ\n( q∑\nn=k1+1\n√n|n⟩⟨n−1|+\n∞∑\nn=q+k3+1\n√n|n⟩⟨n−1|\n)\n,\nwhere q= k1 + k2 and k1,k2,k3 are respectively areas of the inner black, white and\nouter black regions.\nIV. Plane-wave solution\nThe plane-wave can be found either as an independent solution or as a limit of the\ndroplet. This amounts to pulling the top left corner of the Z and Φ matrices in\nthe droplet solution to inﬁnity. It is readily seen that the resulting co nﬁguration,\nas expected, describes a Fermi sea. Taking such a limit of the drople t solution with\nwhite rings inside, will yield the ladder conﬁguration. One should note t hat in the\nlatter case, the limit is possible if the original solution describes very n arrow black\nand white rings near the edge of the droplet. This means that the no nzero islands\nin Z and Φ matrices which describe the black and white stripes respective ly, must\nbe very small compared to the dimension of the top left sub matrix of Z which\ndescribes the droplet.\n4.3 Closer connection to N = 4 SYM and QH states\nA 1/2 BPS operator of N = 4 U(N) SYM is characterized by a couple of quantum\nnumbers. The ﬁrst one which is not usually mentioned is the size of mat rices N.\nThe second is R-charge J. With a given J and N, the number of traces (or number\nof subdeterminants) in the operator constitute the other quant um numbers. As\n19\nreviewed in section 3.2 and depicted in Fig.1 all this information can be su mmarized\nin a Young tableau or conﬁguration of concentric rings. It is instruc tive to extract\nall these information from our Z and Φ matrices.\nIt is readily seen that the only non-zero entries of the matrix Z†Z for a BPS\nconﬁguration, in the harmonic oscillator basis we have employed, are diagonal ones,\nwhere we have black regions. Therefore, the number of non-zero elements of Z†Z\nis N. In order to represent N as trace over a matrix, we construct a regularized\nmatrix inversion for any given matrix A\nA−1\nreg ≡1\n2 lim\nǫ→0\n( 1\nA+ ǫ1 + 1\nA−ǫ1\n)\n. (4.18)\nThis deﬁnition of A−1 reduces to the standard one when A is invertible and has no\nzero eigenvalues. However, when A has zero eigenvalues is takes out the part with\nzero eigenvalues and inverts the rest of the matrix, e.g.\nA= diag(a1,a2,··· ,ak,0,0 ···) ⇒ A−1\nreg = diag( 1\na1\n, 1\na2\n,··· , 1\nak\n,0,0 ···) .\nUsing (4.18) it is then easy to construct N as\nNb = Tr\n(\n(Z†Z)(Z†Z)−1\nreg\n)\n. (4.19)\nθNb is the area of the black region. Similarly one can deﬁne Nw =Tr\n(\n(ΦΦ †)(ΦΦ †)−1\nreg\n)\nas the area of the white region. In our case we have chosen Nb to be ﬁnite while\nNw is inﬁnite. Obviously both Nb and Nw are conserved quantum numbers on the\nspace of BPS solutions, as they are all static.\nThe quantum number J is associated with the rotation symmetry in the Z-plane.\nIn other words, J is the Neother charge for the rotations Z →eiφZ, i.e.\nJ = Tr(Z†Z) −1\n2Nb(Nb + 1) , (4.20)\nwhere we have subtracted oﬀ the “zero point energy” 1\n2 Nb(Nb +1) to match with the\nconventions of quantum Hall system and the super Yang-Mills. One c an also deﬁne\nJw = Tr(ΦΦ †), which is again the Neother charge associated with the rotations in\nthe Φ-plane. It is easy to see that for the disk conﬁguration (4.16) Nb = N and\nJ = 0 and for the ring solution (4.17) Nb = k1 + k3 and J = k2k3.\nIn section 2.2 we discussed that the density of the quantum Hall ﬂuid (in the Euler\ndescription) is ( θǫij {Xi,Xj})\n−1\n(2.10). Hence the inverse of [ Z,Z†] (or −[Φ ,Φ †])\nshould correspond to the particle (hole) density\nρpart = [ Z,Z†]−1\nreg , ρ hole = [Φ †,Φ] −1\nreg . (4.21)\nIt is straightforward to see that for our concentric ring solutions in the harmonic\noscillator basis [ Z,Z†] is diagonal and except for the boundaries of the black and\n20\nwhite regions, where we have color-changing, ρ takes values zero or one. This is\nas we expected and is made explicit in the LLM construction. For exam ple for the\nsingle ring conﬁguration given in (4.17)\nρpart =diag(\nk1\n  \n1,1,··· ,1,−1\nk1\n,\nk2−1\n  \n0,0 ··· ,0, 1\nk1 + k2 + 1 ,\nk3−1\n  \n1,··· ,1, −1\nk1 + k2 + k3\n,0,···) ,\nρhole =diag(0,0,··· ,0  \nk1\n, 1\nk1 + 1 ,1,1 ··· ,1  \nk2−1\n, −1\nk1 + k2\n,0,··· ,0  \nk3−1\n, 1\nk1 + k2 + k3 + 1 ,1,···) .\n(4.22)\nNumber of rings is then related to the number of non-integer elemen ts of ρ.\nAlternatively, one can show that\nr≡♯Rings = 1\n2Tr\n(\n(ρpart[Z,Z†]) −Nb −1\n)\n. (4.23)\nAs we see all the information of the Young tableau can easily be extra cted from Z†Z\nand [ Z,Z†] by methods similar to those mentioned above.\nAs discussed earlier, Φ matrices behave as (inﬁnite) collection of Poly chronakos\nedge states Ψ. To make a closer connection to the edge states, we note that diagonal\nelements of [Φ †,Φ] (or [ Z,Z†]) are either zero or one except on the edge of the rings.\nThis happens in 2 r+ 1 points. Hence [Φ ,Φ †]2 + [Φ ,Φ †] is zero except on the locus\nwhere we have color-changing. 4 Explicitly\n[Φ ,Φ †]2 + [Φ ,Φ †] =\n2r+1∑\nn=1\nΨ nΨ †\nn(Ψ nΨ †\nn −1) , (4.24)\nwhere Ψ n are the eﬀective edge states we need to include in the NC Chern-Simo ns\nMatrix theory to describe a conﬁguration with r rings.5\nWe should, however, emphasize an important diﬀerence between ou r Φ ﬁeld and\nthe edge state(s) Ψ. As mentioned earlier, our Φ ﬁeld is a classical (e ﬀective) ﬁeld\ntheory description of the quantized Polychronakos model. In the d roplet with a hole\nsolution (2.26) the size of the hole q is not quantized. In our model, as it can be\nseen from (4.17) (by setting k1 = 0) the area of the hole is quantized. In our Z-Φ\nsymmetric model, unlike the Polychronakos model, 6 the area of the white and black\nregions, are quantized both in the same units, θ. The latter is a property of quantum\n4A similar observation has been made in [30]. There, however, it was pro posed to take [Φ , Φ †]2 +\n[Φ , Φ †] = 0, ignoring the edge eﬀects.\n5We would like to comment that in the Polychronakos terminology in fact we do not need\n2r+ 1 edge states and r+ 1 of them is enough; whenever we are moving from a black region to\nwhite region we need an edge state. Or in terms of our matrices that is the number of negative\neigenvalues of the [ Z,Z †] matrix.\n6It is notable that in the quantized Polychronakos model, the Caloger o model, the area of the\nholes q is also quantized [13].\n21\nHall systems with ν = 1. As the other manifestation of this “quantization” we note\nthat in our model the transition between black and white regions doe s not occur\nsuddenly. For example, as it is seen from (4.22) there are 2 r+ 1 points where the\nchange of color happens. These are the places where ρpart and ρhole have overlap.\n4.4 More on symmetries of the Z-Φ model\nAs already discussed in the N = 4 SYM a Young tableau may be interpreted as a\nconﬁguration of sphere giants or AdS (dual) giants. On the other h and in principle,\nsimilar to the usual D-brane case, we have the option of having anti- giants of either\nkind. Of course in a 1/2 BPS sector with a given supersymmetry we on ly see giants\nor anti-giants and not both. There are two Z2 symmetries relating sphere giants\nand the AdS giants and/or giants and anti-giants [27]. In our Z-Φ model, in which\ngiants and dual giants, respectively denoted by Φ and Z, appear as independent\ndegrees of freedom one can realize both of the above Z2 symmetries. Both of these\nsymmetries are essentially exchanging the black and white regions.\nThe BPS equation (4.9) is manifestly invariant under the exchange of Z and Φ\nand the Gauss law constraint (4.7), as well as (4.10), would remain un changed if we\nalso send θ→−θ. In other words,\nZ ←→Φ , (4.25a)\nθ←→−θ , (4.25b)\nis a symmetry of BPS conﬁgurations. (4.25b) in the LLM language mea ns that\nbesides the changing the black and white regions one should also chan ge the orien-\ntation of the ( x1,x2) plane ( cf. (1.1)) [27]. The value of A0 (4.10), noting the Gauss\nlaw constraint, remains unchanged under the above Z2 symmetry. In the quantum\nHall language the above is a particle ↔quasihole symmetry.\nThe BPS conﬁgurations are invariant under another Z2 transformation which\nexchanges a giant with a dual anti-giant, i.e.\nZ ←→Φ † , (4.26a)\nt,A0 ←→−t,−A0 . (4.26b)\nIn the above transformation we exchange black and white regions w ithout changing\nthe ( x1,x2) plane orientation. In the quantum Hall terminology (4.26) which con -\ntains an inversion in time is a particle/anti-quasihole exchange symmet ry. Although\nour BPS equations are Z2 invariant, their solutions are not necessarily symmetric,\nas it is manifest in the black-white diagrams. The only Z2 symmetric solution is\nwhen half of the plane is ﬁlled by the black region, corresponding to th e plane-wave\nsolution in the supergravity setup [5].\nCompared to N = 4 SYM the rank of the gauge group N, in our model appears\nas a characteristic of the speciﬁc solutions rather than a paramet er in the Z-Φ\nLagrangian. This observation opens the way for extensions of AdS /CFT in which\n22\ncertain quantities of U(N) and U(M) gauge theories are related. In fact one can\ndistinguish two diﬀerent such extensions. The ﬁrst is inspired by Fig. 3 according\nwhich there is a relation between giants of a U(k1 +k3) gauge theory and dual giants\nof a U(k1) gauge theory. This is a very remarkable result, if it can be extende d to\nbeyond the 1/2 BPS sector and to the full theory, as one can then always use a\n“dual” picture in which the rank of the gauge group is large and one ca n perform\nthe ’t Hooft planar-nonplanar expansion.\nThe other such duality between gauge theories of diﬀerent rank ma y come from\nthe above mentioned black/white exchange symmetry. Consider th e static solutions\nof our particle-hole symmetric matrix model which describe a black dr oplet with\ncircular white rings inside. (4.25) exchanges the giants and dual gian ts, if the Z’s\nare scalars of a U(N + M) gauge theory, one then expects that Φ’s should become\nthe scalars of a U(M) theory and vice-versa. To make the argument more tractable,\nwe take the matrices ﬁnite dimensional of size N + M such that for each solution,\n[Z,Z†] has N and [Φ ,Φ †] has M nonzero diagonal components. 7 Furthermore, we\nassume that N ≪M. The ground state of such a system will thus be described by\na white 2-sphere with a very small black spot, on the north pole say. This state is\ngiven by\n[Z,Z†]ij = δij , i,j = 1 ,2,··· ,N , [Z,Z†]N+1N+1 = −N ,\n[Φ ,Φ †]ij = δij , i,j = N + 2,··· ,N + M , [Φ ,Φ †]N+1N+1 = N + 1 .(4.27)\nExcitations of the system are represented by nonzero diagonal is lands in the com-\nmutators. Suppose an excitation which has an island of length n in [ Z,Z†] and\nan island of length m in [Φ ,Φ †]. One can view this, as a 1/2 BPS excitation of a\nU(N) N = 4 SYM produced by ( β(P )\nn\n†\n)\nm\nacting on the gauge invariant vacuum or,\nequivalently, as such an excitation of a U(M) N = 4 SYM which is now produced\nby ( β(H)\nm\n†\n)\nn\n(where the superscript P (H) on β denotes Particle (Hole).) Remember\nthat, as stated in 3.2, βn\n† is the operator that produces gauge invariant states in\nthe trace basis by acting upon |0⟩tr [3, 29].\nIn other words, the excitations of the black Fermi level can be rela ted to the\nhole states by going from trace to sub-determinant basis in the U(N) theory. On\nthe other hand, the same particle states can be related to the exc itations of the\nwhite Fermi level by going from sub-determinant to trace basis in th e U(M) theory.\nAs a result, the trace (sub-determinant) operators of the two t heories can be easily\nmapped to one another using the Z and Φ matrices.\n7Of course in our Z-Φ model we are always dealing with inﬁnite size matrices. In order to k eep\nboth N and M ﬁnite, in the LLM terminology, we should consider the case with compa ct ( x1,x 2)\nplane. This will bring further complications [5] which would be addresse d in a future work [28].\n23\n4.5 Stability analysis of the BPS conﬁgurations\nSo far we have stated the BPS equations of our Z-Φ model, constructed and analyzed\nconcentric ring solutions. In this section we study classical stability of these BPS\nconﬁgurations. To examine the stability let us start with the equatio ns of motion\nfor Z† and Φ †:\nD0Z− i\n4mθ2 [[Φ ,Φ †],Z] + i\n2mθ2 [Φ †,[Z,Φ]] = 0 ,\n(4.28)\nD0Φ + i\n4mθ2 [[Z,Z†],Φ] + i\n2mθ2 [Z†,[Z,Φ]] + i\n2\n∂TrV\n∂Φ † = 0 .\n(The equations of motion for Z and Φ are similar to these equations obtained by\ngetting a hermitian conjugate.) The above should be solved togethe r with the equa-\ntion of motion for A0, the Gauss law constraint (4.7). In the gauge where A0 is\ngiven by (4.10), the equations of motion simplify signiﬁcantly to take t he form\n˙Φ + i\n2mθ2 [Z†,[Z,Φ]] = 0 , (4.29a)\n˙Z+ i\n2mθ2 [Φ †,[Z,Φ]] = 0 , (4.29b)\nwhere dot denotes the time derivative.\nTo address the classical stability of the BPS conﬁgurations ﬁrst we note that\nequations (4.29) are ﬁrst order in time and hence there is no non-tr ivial solution\nwhich at t = 0 is a BPS conﬁguration Φ( t = 0) = Φ 0 and Z(t = 0) = Z0, where\n[Z0,Φ 0] = 0. Next let us perturb the BPS solution as\nΦ = Φ 0 + δΦ( t) , Z = Z0 + δZ(t) (4.30)\nand let us suppose that there is no time that δZ(t) and δΦ( t) vanish simultaneously\n(otherwise the perturbations would vanish for all t). Plugging the above into (4.29)\nand (4.7) expanding up to the ﬁrst order in perturbations we obtain\n−i d\ndτδZ + [Φ †\n0,[Z0,δΦ]] + [Φ †\n0,[δZ,Φ 0]] = 0 ,\n−i d\ndτδΦ + [ Z†\n0,[Z0,δΦ]] + [ Z†\n0,[δZ,Φ 0]] = 0 ,\n[Z†\n0,δZ] + [ Z0,(δZ)†] = [Φ †\n0,δΦ] + [Φ 0,(δΦ) †] ,\n(4.31)\nwhere τ = 2 mθ2t. In order to show the stability we should argue that the perturba-\ntions do not grow in time. This can be argued for noting the constant s of motion.\nIt can be directly checked that any quantity of the form Tr(AA−1\nreg), which is always\ninteger valued, is (classically) conserved. (To see this it is enough to note (4.18).)\nIn particular the area of the black region, N, and its second moment, J, number of\n24\nrings r and the Hamiltonian are conserved. Hence the perturbations cann ot grow in\ntime.\nAs an example we solve (4.31) for perturbation about the vacuum (t he whole\nwhite solution) given through (4.12). For this background Z0 = 0 and hence δΦ = 0\nd\ndτδZ −i[Φ †\n0,[Φ 0,δZ]] = 0 , (4.32)\nwhere [Φ 0,Φ †\n0] = −θ. It is readily seen that\nδZ = e−iωτ ekΦ 0 epΦ †\n0 (4.33)\nsolves (4.12) with ω = θ2kp. Assuming that δZ is ﬁnite for large distances on the\nx1,x2 plane we have k = −¯p leading to ω = −θ2|k|2. Since ω is real valued the\nperturbations does not grow in time. The (4.33), as expected is a no n-relativistic\nwave of particles (black region) moving in e.g. x1 direction. In general we expect\nthat a generic solution to (4.31) to be a linear combination of the plane -waves of the\nform (4.33). Alternatively one may construct a solution to two dimen sional wave\nequations with rotational symmetry, via the Bessel functions. Th e latter would be\nmore appropriate for studying the ﬂuctuations about the circular symmetric ring\nsolutions we considered in section 4.2.\nFinally, from the above discussions it is inferred that classically there is no tran-\nsition between the BPS conﬁgurations. That is, there is no solution w hich at two\ntimes t0 and t1, Z(t0) ̸= Z(t1), is a BPS conﬁguration. As discussed in previous\nsection N and J are both conserved charges and if there is any transition, classica lly\nor quantum mechanically, between various BPS solutions the initial an d ﬁnal states\nshould have the same J and N. A quantum mechanical transition between the rings,\nhowever, imply that the conservation of number of rings r, which holds classically,\nis violated quantum mechanically. In fact it is not diﬃcult to ﬁnd paths ( of course\nnot classical ones) which interpolate between the BPS conﬁguratio ns which are not\nthe dominant contributions compared to the full N = 4 SYM theory analysis [4, 9].\n5 Discussion and Outlook\nIn this paper we have studied, reﬁned and clariﬁed the correspond ence between the\nquantum Hall system and the N = 4 SYM in the 1/2 BPS sector and the LLM\ngeometries, which was discussed in [5, 6]. In this viewpoint the 1/2 BPS sector of\nN = 4 SYM is equivalent to a QHS with ﬁlling fraction ν = 1. We showed the\nequivalence of the two at the level of the actions and the Hilbert spa ces and/or the\npartition function of the N = 4 SYM in the 1/2 BPS sector. We have shown that\nthe (square of) the Laughlin wavefunction with ν = 1 is nothing but the partition\nfunction of the N = 4 SYM in the 1/2 BPS sector. In sum, we discussed and related\nfour corners of the square depicted in the Fig. 4.\n25\nNCCS Matrix Model Quantum Hall Physics\nHalf BPS Sector of N=4 SYM LLM Geometries\nFigure 4: In this paper we have worked out and discussed relation of all the four\ncorners of the above ﬁgure. The only case that we did not address here was a direct\nconnection of LLM geometries and noncommutative Chern-Simons M atrix model.\nThis may be done along the lines of minisuperspace quantization metho d for the\nLLM geometries. This point has been recently discussed in [32].\nIn the quantum Hall side the same machinery can be used for ν <1 systems, the\nfractional quantum Hall eﬀect ( ν >1 has problems with unitarity). We can now turn\nto the interesting question of the relevance of FQHS in the context of AdS/CFT, an\nissue which we advertised for in the paper. As mentioned before, th e physical states\nof a ﬁnite FQHS with ν = 1 /k can be found as the states of a quantum Calogero\nmodel. The particles of this system, obeying an enhanced Pauli exclu sion principle,\noccupy the energy states of a harmonic oscillator such that no two states closer than\nk are occupied. This results in the fact that on the noncommutative p lane where\nthe particles live, the area quantum for the particles is k times bigger than that for\nthe holes but since we are probing the plane by the particles, and not with the holes,\nk+ 1 possible values are found for the particle density. Therefore on e can take an\nequivalent but more convenient picture of the system; think of par ticles as ordinary\nfermions but of holes as obeying a “reduced” exclusion principle such that at most\nk number of these objects can be put on top of one another. Such a “reduction”\ncannot happen for particles which is a result of the upper bound on ν(≤1) and thus\naccumulation of particles is not allowed.\nOne can make an analogous argument for the LLM geometries. Thes e solutions\nhave two important features; noncommutativity of ( z1,z2) and smoothness condition\n(z0 = ±1/2). The ﬁrst one arises upon the identiﬁcation of the boundary plan e with\n26\nthe phase space of the dual fermionic system. Therefore, this fe ature is originating\nfrom the quantum nature of the corresponding QHS. In the geome tric language,\nthis noncommutativity is translated through the statement that e ven a single giant\ngraviton in the AdS background produces a gravitational back rea ction such that\nthe boundary conﬁguration for the resulting geometry is depicted as a white spot\nof minimal area inside a black droplet. This noncommutativity of the ( x1,x2) plane\nis a result of quantum gravity considerations, coming from the dual SYM picture,\nvia AdS/CFT. The smoothness condition of LLM geometries, on the o ther hand, is\na statement about the statistics of the particles and holes in the du al QHS. As was\nfound in [31], in order to exclude geometries with Closed Time-like Curve s (CTC),\none has to impose an upper bound on the boundary value z0 ≤1. In parallel lines\nwith the above arguments one can say that the dual giants by which one probes\nthe LLM backgrounds cannot be put on top of one another, a “str ingy exclusion\nprinciple” [7], which is a result of the exclusion of CTC’s in the geometries (z0 ≤1).\nOn the other hand, giant gravitons also obey a “stringy exclusion pr inciple” which\nis not reduced because the regularity of solutions does not allow for −1/2 < z0 <\n1/2 and hence there are no coincident giants or dual giants in the LLM setup.\nNamely, LLM do not have such solutions, because they only work with black and\nwhite regions. In their setup this is a condition coming form smoothne ss of the\nsolutions. The latter have been made manifest in our Z-Φ symmetric model where\nΦ is associated with giants and Z with dual giants.\nIn other words, Pauli exclusion principle which is there for both quas iholes and\nparticles in a quantum Hall system with ν = 1, is a manifestation of the “stringy ex-\nclusion principle” coming out of giants and dual giants considerations . (The stringy\nexlcusion principle in the context of supergravity has also been discu ssed in [23].)\nAs stated here the N = 4 SYM in the 1/2 BPS sector is related to quantum\nHall system with ν = 1. One interesting open question is whether the QHE/SYM\ncorrespondence can be pushed to ν <1 where we have the possibility of fractional\nquantum Hall eﬀect and anyons. From our discussions it is inferred t hat such cor-\nrespondence, if it exists, cannot happen on the 1/2 BPS sector an d we need to go\nbeyond this sector. One possibility, which is a direct outcome of the d iscussions of\nthe above paragraphs about the fractional statistics of the qua siholes in the ν <1\ncases, is to consider orbifolding in the Z,Z† or Φ ,Φ † plane. That is, considering a\nS5/Zk orbifold of the AdS5 ×S5 geometry where the orbifolding is keeping an SO(4)\nand is only acting on the S1 in the Z,Z† plane. This orbifold has a ﬁxed point at\nZ = 0 and is breaking all the supersymmetry. Upon orbifolding we are ide ntifying k\nslices of the black disk, that is as if we have kparticles of fractional statistics on top\nof each other. This can happen if ν = 1 /k. This proposal immediately tells why ν−1\nshould be quantized. On the other hand, one can show that the sup erstar solutions\n[33], which are 1/2 BPS solutions of IIB supergravity with a naked sing ularity, are\neﬀectively behaving like a quantum Hall system with ν <1 ( more precisely, ν = 1\n1+q\nwhere q is an integer related to the R-charge of the solution.) The above proposal\nthen suggests that there should be a relation between the orbifold singularity and\n27\nthe naked singularity of the superstar. Further exploration of diﬀ erent aspects of\nthis idea is postponed to future works.\nIn the 1/2 BPS sector one can compute transition amplitudes betwe en giant\ngravitons. That is basically the computation of three point function of three chiral\nprimary operators carried out in [4]. This possibility has been ignored in the LLM\nsetup. In our Z-Φ model, as we argued our BPS solutions are classically stable and\nas a result the number of giants is a conserved quantity. (In the Ca logero model there\nis no possibility of such transitions between ring solutions, as states with diﬀerent\nnumber of rings (giants) are orthogonal eigenstates of the Calog ero Hamiltonian.) In\nthe Z-Φ model, however, one has the possibility of quantum tunneling betw een giants\nand hence number of giants is not conserved once the quantum (no n-perturbative\ninstanton) eﬀects are considered. This expectation is compatible w ith the picture\nadvocated in section 2.4 of [34].\nAs another interesting extension one may try to push the QHE/SYM correspon-\ndence to beyond the 1/2 BPS sector. For example let us consider a p art of the 1/4\nBPS sector only containing operator made out of two of the three c omplex scalars,\nsay Z and Y. As we argued in section 3.1 one may think of the angular momen-\ntum ( R-charge) operator J as the eﬀective action for the BPS sector, roughly that\nis Tr(Z δ\nδZ ) + Tr(Y δ\nδY ). This is very similar to a four dimensional quantum Hall\nsystem. This is an open direction in need of further analysis.\nThe last interesting open question we would like to brieﬂy discuss is the “duality”\nwe alluded to at the end of section 4.4. To argue for the “duality” bet ween U(N)\nand U(M + N) gauge theories we made the assumption that the total area of th e\nblack and white regions is ﬁnite. In the LLM terminology, that is the ( x1,x2) plane\nis compact and since ( x1,x2) plane is ﬂat, our choices are limited to tori. (Note the\nfootnote at the end of page 7 in [5] for a comment on this issue.) Since (x1,x2) plane\nis noncommutative, this torus should be a fuzzy torus. Exploring th e possibility of\ncompactifying ( x1,x2) plane from gravity and/or QH system side and its implication\nof that for the “duality” mentioned above is left for future works.\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank Jorge Russo for discussions and Vishnu Jejjala for his col-\nlaboration at the early stages of this work.
