All rights reserved. \na product’s life cycle, product carbon footprint (PCF) \nestimation enables carbon labeling and the development of \neffective strategies to reduce environmental impact (Jensen, \n2012). \nThe traditional LCA approach to estimate PCF through a \nfive-step process: determining system boundaries, emission \ninventory analysis, collecting activity data, identifying \nEmission Factors (EFs), and evaluating environmental \nimpacts. However, these methods often face significant \nchallenges and limitations. Determi ning the emission \nsources and constructing complete emission inventories \nrequire extensive research, often relying on a combination \nof primary data collection, literature reviews, and expert \njudgment (Curran et al., 2006) . This process is time -\nconsuming, resource-intensive, and subject to uncertainties. \nMoreover, the selection of EFs which directly influences the \nresults of carbon footprint calculations, is highly dependent \non expert knowledge and subjective decision -making, \nintroducing potential biases and inconsistencies \n(McKinnon, 2010) . These limitations necessitate the \nexploration of alternative approaches that can enhance the \nefficiency of carbon footprint estimation. \nIn recent years, machine-learning methods have emerged \nas promising approaches for carbon emission analysis \n(Algren et al., 2021; Balaji et al., 2023; Han et al., 2021; G. \nLiu et al., 2022; Shinde et al., 2022; Zhao et al., 2022) . \nHowever, to the best of our knowledge, the only two studies \nthat try to apply machine learning methods to conduct \nproduct carbon footprinting have not investigated the carbon \nestimation process of the products (Balaji et al., 2023; Zhao \net al., 2022) . In addition, the emergence of large language \nAAAI Fall Symposium Series (FSS-23)\n102\nmodels (LLMs), such as GPT series (Brown et al., 2020; \nRadford et al., 2019, 2018) and GLM (Du et al., 2022; Zeng \net al., 2022) , has presented the potential for further \nadvancements in carbon management. LLMs are powerful \ndeep-learning models that have been trained on vast \namounts of text data, enabling them to generate coherent and \ncontextually relevant responses. Some papers hav e \ndiscussed the potential of LLMs in carbon management and \nenvironmental research (Agathokleous et al., 2023; Zhu et \nal., 2023). LLMs possess powerful language understanding \ncapabilities, allowing them to generate detailed descriptions \nand simulate various production processes. This indicates a \npossibility of applying LLMs and deep learning models to \nestimate PCF and improve efficiency.  \nIn this paper, a novel framework that leverages the \nstrengths of deep-learning methods and LLMs for automatic \nPCF estimation is proposed, named AutoPCF. It consists of \nmultiple interconnected stages, including Emission \nInventory Determination (EID), Activi ty Data Collection \n(ADC), Emission Factor Matching (EFM), Carbon \nEmission Estimation (CEE), and Estimation Verification \nand Evaluation (EVE). By integrating these stages, \nAutoPCF offers an efficient and automated solution to \novercome the limitations of current estimation methods.  \nMethod \nIn this paper, the estimation of PCF focuses on assessing the \ncarbon emissions associated with the most significant \nsources of a product's lifecycle. This includes key stages, \nraw material extraction, and manufacturing and production, \nalso known as cradle-to-gate LCA (Niccolucci et al., 2010). \nThe PCF assessment takes into account seven greenhouse \ngases, namely carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous \noxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons \n(PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6), and nitrogen trifluoride \n(NF3), which are covered by the UNFCCC/Kyoto Protocol. \nTo provide a standardized measure, the PCF is expressed in \nterms of CO2 equivalent (CO2-eq) based on their respective \nGlobal Warming Potentials (GWPs).  \nThe proposed framework, AutoPCF, integrates deep -\nlearning models and LLMs to optimize the process of LCA \nmethods and enhance the efficiency of PCF estimation. The \nAutoPCF comprises an interconnected network of stages \naimed at achieving comprehensive and au tomated PCF \nestimation, including EID, ADC, EFM, CEE, and EVE \nstages. The flowchart of the framework is shown in Fig.1.  \nThe efficiency of PCF estimation mainly depends on \nthree processes: EID, ADC, and EFM. Below the improved \nmethods for these three processes are described in detail. By \nutilizing the activity data and the corresponding EFs, the EE \nstage estimates the PCF, as represented by Eq. (1).  \nE=∑ ADf × EFf          (1) \nFigure 1: The framework of AutoPCF \nwhere 𝐴𝐷𝑓 and 𝐸𝐹𝑓 are the activity data and EF of the \nactivity 𝑓, e.g., the fuels consumed. Then EVE verifies the \nconfidence and efficiency of the AutoPCF. By integrating \nthese interconnected stages, AutoPCF offers a \ncomprehensive and automated solution that addresses the \nlimitations of existing estimation methods.  \nEmission Inventory Determination \nHere LLMs are used to conduct emission inventory analysis \nby carefully designing prompts, including production \nprocess generation and activity inventory identification for \neach process, such as materials, energy, and waste. The \nproduction process of the pr oduct is acquired in a \nconversational way by providing prompts and requirements. \nThe LLM is instructed to act as an expert in product \nproduction. The question asking about the production \nprocess of the product is first constructed. A requirement on \nthe out put is pre -defined to control the format of the \noutputted production process. Then a prompt is constructed \nwith these settings and LLM outputs the production process. \nAn example prompt for generating production processes is \nshown in Appendix  Table A1. After the production process \nof the product is determined, the activity inventory of each \nprocess is to be generated in a similar way by appropriately \nproviding prompts and in-context information. \nActivity Data Collection \nActivity data refers to the amount of raw materials or energy \nconsumed and waste generated during the production \nprocess. Two methods are proposed to generate activity data \nrequired for PCF accounting. \n• Direct generation approach: Similar to emission \ninventory generation, appropriate prompts are constructed \nto enable LLMs to automatically generate and output \nactivity data corresponding to the inventory.  \n103\n• Indirect estimation approach: A top -down approach was \nutilized, relying on industry -wide macro -statistics data, to \ncreate activity data for each process outlined in the emission \ninventory.  \nEmission Factor Matching \nThe semantic similarity between the emission inventory and \nthe EF database (Ecoinvent database (Wernet et al., 2016)) \nis calculated based on sentence transformers, and the EF \nwith the highest similarity is assigned to each emission \ninventory. First, the EF names, process names, and EF \nclassification information in the EF database are encoded \ninto vectors of length 768 b y a pre -trained language \nmodel(msmarco-bert-base-dot-v5) and stored in the vector \nlibrary. Second, the emission inventory is input into the \nsame encoder to obtain the corresponding sentence vector \nwhen performing EF matching for a specific emission \ninventory. Third, the cosine similarity between the emission \ninventory sentence vector and the vector in the vector library \nis calculated, and the EF with the highest similarity is \ndetermined. \nExperiments and Results  \nThis study evaluate d the effectiveness of the proposed \nframework by the reliability of PCF results and the time cost \nof PCF estimation, which is verified on products from three \nindustries, hot rolled round steel (HRRS), printed and dyed \nfabric (PDF), and lithium iron phosphat e battery (LIPB). \nFive LLMs are employed to generate the required \ninformation and compared, including GPT -3.5, GPT -4, \nTongyi Qianwen, GLM-130B, and ChatGLM-6B. Not only \nthe effectiveness of the AutoPCF is analyzed, but the \nuncertainty o f deep learning models used for various \nestimation stages is discussed. \nEmission Inventory Generation Performance \nThe production process es of the three products and the \nemission inventories in each process have been obtained \nthrough various LLMs. Different LLMs may yield varying \noutputs based on different prompt words. However, for the \npurpose of comparing the effects between different models, \nthe prompts used were generally kept consistent and were \nnot specifically optimized for individual models.  \nAn illustrative example of the results generated by GPT -\n3.5 is shown in Appendix Table A 2. In this instance, the \nproduction of printed and dyed fabric included 9 processes, \nwhich covered the entire process as per expert experience, \nincluding steps such as Spinning, weaving, printing, dyeing, \nand finishing (see Appendix Table A 3). In addition, the \nmodel also yielded 17 different emission inventories \ninvolved in each process according to the prompt \nrequirements. \nFigure 2: Performance of LLMs in inventory analysis (y-\naxis: number of raw materials generated) \nTo assess the comprehensiveness of the emission \ninventories produced by the model, Figure 2 compares the \nquantities of raw materials generated by the different LLMs \nand manually confirmed to be correct. Noticeable variations \nexist in the generative capacity across different models. \nChatGLM-6B yielded a comparatively smaller number of \ninventories, which could be attributed to the smaller scale of \nthe training corpus a nd model parameters employed. \nConversely, GPT -3.5 and GPT -4 demonstrate superior \nperformance, showcasing greater alignment and \ncomprehensiveness akin to expert-derived inventories. This \nobservation underscores the pivotal role of the model's \nknowledge base in achieving effective generation. \nPCF Estimation Effectiveness \nWe proceed to examine the efficiency of PCF estimation \nachieved by AutoPCF. This assessment encompasses both \nresult reliability and cost -effectiveness. The PCF results \nestimated by AutoPCF based on direct activity data \ngeneration with various LLMs are comp ared in Table 1. In \norder to reflect the effectiveness of the results, we use the \ndata provided by the actual production enterprises as the \nbasis for carbon footprint accounting using the Energy \nExpert platform  (https://energy.alibabacloud.com/), and \ncompare and analyse the results of the accounting as an \nexpert value with the results output by AutoPCF. \nWhile the model may occasionally generate emission in -\nventories with omissions or irrelevant items in comparison \nto the comprehensive inventories compiled by experts, the \nensuing PCF outcomes remain within an acceptable range. \nSpecifically, AutoPCF using G PT 3.5 exhibited consistent \nestimation results for HRRS and PDF, aligning closely with \nexpert estimations and showcasing its substantial \ncomprehension of LCA principles. In contrast, the \napplication of GLM-130B within AutoPCF yielded notably \nextreme estima tions for these same three products. This \nsuggests that GLM-130B might lack pertinent training data \nwithin its pretraining stages. \n104\nTo rigorously assess the stability and confidence of the \nproposed AutoPCF, we examined the uncertainty ranges of \nboth experts' estimations and AutoPCF outcomes, as de -\npicted in Table 1. Among experts, uncertainties primarily \nemanate from the determination of activity data and the se -\nlection of EFs. Variations can arise due to missing data or \nsubjective judgments introduced during the estimation pro -\ncess. For AutoPCF, the outcomes produc ed by LLMs \ninherently exhibit stochastic behavior.  \nTo further demonstrate the generalisability of AutoPCF, \nwe performed a GPT3.5 analysis on a further 10 products. \nThe results, as displayed in Figure 3, showed that the ratio \nof test result values to the reference value ranged from 25% \nto 211%. While some of the outcomes exhibited \nconsiderable variance, some products showed values that \nwere in close proximity to the reference value. This \nconfirms that AutoPCF can be utilised to determine the \ncarbon footprint of other products. \n \nFigure 3: Comparison between tested and reference values \nfor 10 types of products \nFurthermore, AutoPCF  has effectively demonstrated \nsignificant cost reduction by automating the estimation \nprocess through programming. The carbon footprint \nestimation for a product can now be accomplished within a \nmatter of minutes, a stark contrast to the expert method that \nconsumes hours or days. It is essential to recognize that even \nexperts cannot achieve absolute consistency in PCF \nestimation, given the intricate and variable nature of \nproduction processes and raw materials. The primary \nobjective here is to attain the mos t comprehensive and \ninclusive estimation of a product's carbon footprint. In light \nof the estimated PCF, standardized default values for carbon \nfootprints can be derived and utilized for environmental \ndisclosure. This is particularly valuable for producers  who \nmay encounter challenges in furnishing credible and \ntransparent PCF calculations. \nConclusion and Future Work \nIn this paper, AutoPCF is proposed for PCF estimation, \naiming to enhance efficiency and reduce costs of LCA -\nbased PCF estimation in the following way: \n 1) Leveraging the exceptional capabilities of LLMs in \nlanguage comprehension and knowledge extraction to assist \nLCA practitioners in quickly identifying emission \ninventories during the PCF accounting process. \n 2) A deep learning-based matching model is developed to \nreplace the experience of experts, which can be well applied \nto the generation of activity data and the matching of EFs. \n 3) By employing the automatic PCF modeling approach, \nit becomes possible to rapidly estimate the carbon footprint \nof a specific product category with minimal data input.  \n Future improvements on the models and implications for \nemission reduction and carbon neutrality path are worth to \nbe conducted. Future work can focus on enhancing the \nperformance and accuracy of the underlying deep -learning \nmodels and LLMs used in AutoPCF . This may involve \nexploring advanced architectures, incorporating more \ndiverse training data, and fine-tuning the models to specific \nindustry sectors. Especially, the LLM models can be \nimproved by constructing a local knowledge base and \ntraining an LLM mo del specially designed for PCF \nestimation. In addition, a PCF calculator is expected to be \nlaunched in the future, containing a wide range of products \nfor various industries. \nReferences  \nAgathokleous, E., Saitanis, C.J., Fang, C., Yu, Z. 2023.
