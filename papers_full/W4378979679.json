  "abstract": "Radiation therapy is a fundamental cancer treatment in the clinic. However, to satisfy the clinical requirements, radiologists have to iteratively adjust the radiotherapy plan based on experience, causing it extremely subjective and time-consuming to obtain a clinically acceptable plan. To this end, we introduce a transformer-embedded multi-task dose prediction (TransMTDP) network to automatically predict the dose distribution in radiotherapy. Specifically, to achieve more stable and accurate dose predictions, three highly correlated tasks are included in our TransMTDP network, i.e. a main dose prediction task to provide each pixel with a fine-grained dose value, an auxiliary isodose lines prediction task to produce coarse-grained dose ranges, and an auxiliary gradient prediction task to learn subtle gradient information such as radiation patterns and edges in the dose maps. The three correlated tasks are integrated through a shared encoder, following the multi-task learning strategy. To strengthen the connection of the output layers for different tasks, we further use two additional constraints, i.e. isodose consistency loss and gradient consistency loss, to reinforce the match between the dose distribution features generated by the auxiliary tasks and the main task. Additionally, considering many organs in the human body are symmetrical and the dose maps present abundant global features, we embed the transformer into our framework to capture the long-range dependencies of the dose maps. Evaluated on an in-house rectum cancer dataset and a public head and neck cancer dataset, our method gains superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art ones.
