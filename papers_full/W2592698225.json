INTRODUCTION \nTransformers are exploited in RFIC (radio-frequency integrated circuit) functions in place of two \ninductors in disparity circuits to acquire superior Q (quality factor) while absorbing less expire region [1]. \nThey are also utilized for solitary to differen tial signal translation, impedance matching, signal pairing and \nphase dividing. A transformer is shaped when two spiral coils, or inductors, magnetically combine due to \ntheir close proximity. This reasons the impedance levels, distincted as the ratio of th e terminal voltage to the \ncurrent flow, to modify between coils [2 -4]. The transformer characteristics comprise the self -inductance, \nseries resistance, mutual coupling coefficient, substrate capacitances, self resonating frequencies, symmetry \nand die regio n. Alike to inductor, the type of transformer structure influences these characteristics and is \nselected based on the application usage the transformer is intended for. The three ordinary transformer \nconfigurations are shown in Figure 1. Figure 1(a) illustrates a tapped structure consisting of an inner winding \nand an outer winding. Mutual combination between adjacent conductors contributes mostly to the self -\ninductance of every coil. The structure is not often useful as the mutual inductance is small due to very small \ncoupling [5]. Figure 1(b) shows two spirals interwound in the equal plane. The interwound spirals guarantee \nelectrical characteristics of primary and secondary are equal, including the similar number of turns. The \ntransformer terminals are situated in opposite side’s permiting easy access for layout [6]. Figure 1 (c) shows \ntwo spirals stacked in divide metal planes. The advantage of the structure is an abridged generally region \nsince it is implemented in different metal layers. The flux linkage between the two windings advances due to \nthe close coupling. The coupling coefficient, K, can be as high as 0.9 for a stacked structure [7]. However, \nthe use of separate metal planes consequences in an asymmetry between the primary and secondary coils  \n                ISSN: 2088-8708 \nIJECE  Vol. 7, No. 1, February 2017 :  41 – 49 \n42 \ncaused by the diverse thickness and metal characteristics of the planes. This layout is suitable for small \nfrequency action as big capacitance between coils due to the overlap results in a low SRF (self resonating \nfrequencies) [8]. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1. Transformers Physical Structures (a) Tapped (b) Interleaved (c) Stacked \n \n \nAn on -chip transformer model is needed for chip technologies. Modeling  and design of on -chip \ninductors and transformers is presented in [9]. Each inductor is constructed with one metal spiral or winding. \nOn-chip transformers, consisting of various windings, may be designed in different ways. \nThe tapped transformer design is chosen for various causes. This structure simply permits for any \nratio of NP: NS, but in return, due to the large relative distance between windings of the two spirals it \nconsequences in a awfully small coupling coefficient, K. Clearly, because of including straight relations \nbetween two spirals there is a superior possibility of circulating tall levels of noise between parts of the \ncircuit that use magnetic coupling. On the other hand, due to low surface area between the two inductors, the \nresulted parasitic capacitance is extremely small which consequences in tall self resonance frequency [10]. \nThe advantages are short port-to-port capacitance and tall Lp and Ls but have the disadvantages of organism \nasymmetric and have short coupling coefficient, approximately around 0.3 to 0.7 [11]. \nIn this paper, square shaped tapped transformer has been studied. Section 2; extract the geometrical \nand technological parameters of the tapped transformer. Section 3, an equivalent -circuit model of tapped \ntransformers is presented. In Section 4, the structure has been optimized by changing the geometrical and \ntechnological parameters of the tapped transformer, to enlarge the quality factor Q and high coupling \ncoefficient K. Moreover, simulation results will be compared with calculation results. Finally, a conclusion is \ndrawn in Section 5. \n \n \n2.

Space and Width of the Primary Coil of the Tapped Transformer \nThe width and the space between turn’s lines of primary coil can influence the inductance and \nquality factor of tapped transformers. Figure 5 shows the space Sp and width Wp of a tapped transformer. \nWhen varying the width and space of primary coil, the ind uctance, quality factor and coupling coefficient \nwill also be changed so as the parasitic capacitance. \nFor the tapped transformer, if the outer diameter and number of turns is fixed, equal summation of \nwidth Wp and space Sp leads to approximately the equal region of the tapped transformer, which is a thought \nin tapped transformer design. Also, the summation constant of width and space (primary coil) are optimized, \ntogether verify the performance of the tapped transformer.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 5.

The width and space of primary coil are 9+16µm, 13+12µm, 17+8µm, and 21+4µm, \nrespectively. The number of turns ( Np and Ns) of these four tapped transformers is fixed at 2 and OD outer \ndiameter is 250µm. Figure 6 shows the four structures of tapped transformer. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 6.

Two different substrate \nthicknesses were also simulated, Tsub = 300 µm and Tsub = 500 µm.

Comparison between Calculated and Simulated Results (a) Primary Inductance and (b) Primary \nQuality Factor of a Tapped Transformer \n \n \nA good accord between the calculated and simulated primary inductance value was also achieved in \nthe holder of tapped transformer. A vaguely bigger calculated inductance value was achieved compared with \nthe simulated results. The calculated inductance value at 3 GHz frequency is 10.45 nH. The simulated \ninductance value at 3 GHz frequency is 7.96 nH. \nThe maximum primary quality factor value achieved by calculating the parameters of the equivalent \nmodel of tapped transformer was 16.82 and was a chieved at 2.2 GHz frequency. The maximum primary \nquality factor value obtained by simulation was 13.15 and was obtained at 2.6 GHz frequency. \n \n \n5. CONCLUSION \nIn this paper, an equivalent circuit model has been presented to study the tapped transformer. This \nmodel present s a great physical perception of the tapped transformer and can be utilize d to remove the \ngeometric and technology parameters. The correctness of the circuit model is definite d by contrasting its \nconsequence with MATLAB simulation result. Also , the physical structure of tapped transformer has been \noptimized to obtain improve performance. By contrast ing the MATLAB simulation results of diverse \nstructures, the quality factor of tapped transformer is optimized by using appropriate , outer diameter,  inner \ndiameter, width, space, substrate thickness and substrate resistivity. The preferred tapped transformer \nspecifications recognized by the designer are transformed into suitable geometrical parameter without \nneglecting the process parameter. \n \n \nREFERENCES \n[1] Parashar K.
