The test \nof the modified residual current device proved that the authors’ proposition is appro-\npriate. \nKey words: current transformers, earth fault currents, electric devices, electromagnetic \ncouplings, high frequency \n \n \n \n1. Introduction \n \nProtection against electric shock in low voltage systems, accordin g to the standard [1], is \nvery often realized with the use of residual current devices (RCDs). They are applied in va-\nrious types of electrical circuits, also in circuits where earth fa ult current with high frequency \ncomponents or high peak value transient leakage current flows. It leads to the problem of \nRCDs compatibility with such type s of current. This problem is  discussed in many papers \n[2-10]. Voltage and current harmonics are mainly produced by power electronics converters [2].  \nAn example oscillogram of the earth fault current from a circuit with a frequency converter \nis presented in Fig. 1. The waveform in Fig. 1 comprises harmonics, especially high-order har-\nmonics. The order of harmonics corresponds with the applied PWM frequency of the con-\nverter. \nTypical residual current devices are not compat ible with the detection of high frequency \nsinusoidal residual currents and residual currents with harmonics. For such earth fault cur-\nrents, the tripping current of residual current devices can be very high [2]. \n                                   S. Czapp, K. Dobrzynski, J. Klucznik, Z. Lubosny, R.

Fig. 2 \npresents the tripping current of the example RCDs as a function of earth fault (residual) cur-\nrent frequency. The tripping current of these RCDs rises with frequency rising, but their sen-\nsitivity to current frequency is not the same. RCD2 is sensitive to the whole testing frequency \nrange. In the case of RCD1 there is no tripping if frequency exceeds 400 Hz. The tripping cur-\nrent is very important especially for residual current devices of IΔn = 30 mA rated residual \ncurrent. If the tripping current rises strongly with frequency rising, the threshold of ventricular \nfibrillation may be exceeded and real hazard of electrocution exists. Such dangerous behaviour \nis represented by the tested RCD1 (Fig. 2). Its tripping current does not exceed the threshold \nof ventricular fibrillation only for frequencies not higher than 300 Hz. \n \n100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n50\nRCD1\nRCD2\nfrequency (Hz)\ntripping current (mA)\n30\nthreshold of ventricular fibrillation\nrated residual current\nFig. 2.

Thus, it is important to perform analysis of the behaviour of \nmain components of residual current devices, especially their current transformer, when high \nfrequency residual current flows. \n \nVol.  66 (2017)            Improving sensitivity of residual CT to HF earth fault currents 487 \n2. Analysis of the operation of the residual current transformer \n \nA residual current device comprises an iron co re current transformer (CT) and an electro-\nmechanical relay (ER) with a permanen t magnet (Fig. 3). The secondary current is(t), trans-\nformed by the current transformer, in the one half-wave amplifies the magnetic flux of the \npermanent magnet but in the second half-wave that flux is reduced. If the current i\ns(t) reaches \na predetermined level, the magnetic flux derived from that current is high enough to reduce \nthe magnetic flux of the permanent magnet, and RCD opens the main circuit. In order to en-\nsure sufficient value of secondary current i\ns(t), sufficient value of secondary voltage es(t), \nespecially peak value, should be induced. \n \n L2L1 L3 NPE\ntest\nRT\ns\n=\nCT\nload\nER\nRCD\ni (t)\nse (t)\npi (t)Δi (t)\nFig. 3. Simplified diagram of a residual current \ndevice (RCD): CT – current transformer, ER – \nelectromechanical relay, RT – test resistance, \niΔ(t) – residual (earth fault) current, ip(t) – pri-\nmary current of the current transformer, is(t) – \nsecondary current of the current transformer, \nes(t) –  induced  secondary voltage of the current \ntransformer \n \n \nSecondary voltage (rms value) is defined by the following formula: \n  Fesss 44.4Φ44.4 sBNfNfE ⋅⋅⋅⋅=⋅⋅⋅= , (1) \nwhere: f is the earth fault current frequency, Ns is the number of turns of the secondary wind-\ning, Φ is the magnetic field strength, B is the magnetic induction, sFe is the current transformer \ncore cross-section. \nUnfortunately, in some cases this voltage does not rise proportionally to frequency (Fig. 4). \nFor a primary current equal to the rated residual current IΔn of a RCD, the induced voltage es(t) \nrises only slightly. If frequency rises 20 times  (from 50 to 1000 Hz) the peak value of es(t) \nrises about 1.35 times (instead of 20). It means that the tripping threshold of a residual current \ndevice rapidly rises and protection against electric shock may not be effective. \nFig. 5 presents peak values of the induced secondary voltage e\npeak as a function of \nfrequency. These values are presented in relation to the value of a freq uency equal to 50 Hz. \nOne can see that for frequencies higher than 25 0 Hz the peak value of induced voltage is \nalmost constant. \n \n                                   S.

The hysteresis loop \nshapes can be various [12-16] and may have a crucial impact on the sensitivity of the current \ntransformer to the earth current waveform. To ac hieve the same level of induction in the cur-\nrent transformer core, for higher frequencies, a higher value of earth fault current is necessary. \nIn the case of this iron core, the proper oper ation of a residual current device (for various \nfrequencies) can be achieved when the operating point of a current transformer (i.e. iron core) \nis situated close to the saturation point for the highest expected frequency (for example fs1000 \nif the highest frequency is equal to 1000 Hz).  \nThe designing process of the residual current devices for circuits of a high frequency re-\nsidual current should take into  account the properties of the iron core of a residual current \ntransformer in the presence of high frequency waveforms. The operating point of the current \ntransformers should then be modified. Fig. 7 presents induced secondary voltage obtained for \nthe proposed modified operating point of the curr ent transformer. The expected rise in voltage \noccurs for a primary current equal to 5 I\nΔn. It is observed that the most important value of the \ninduced secondary voltage – peak value – significantly rises with frequency rising (positive \neffect). This result may be achieved by modification of the windings. The simplest solution is \nto change the number of turns of the primary winding. \nVol.  66 (2017)            Improving sensitivity of residual CT to HF earth fault currents 489 \n induction\nfield strength\n150 Hz\n50 Hz\n1000 Hz\nrequired level\nof induction\nfs50 fs150\nfs1000\n \nFig. 6.

Comparing Fig. 8 to Fig. 5 one  can see that the increase of the peak value is \nmore favourable for 5IΔn (Fig. 8) than for IΔn (Fig. 5). \n \n \n3. Properties of a modified current transformer for high frequency RCDs \n \nTaking into account the above mentioned properties of residual current transformers for \nthe detection of high frequency primary current waveforms, a laboratory model of a residual \ncurrent transformer has been designed. In this concept the current transformer is dedicated for \na RCD of IΔn = 300 mA and its real tripping current should be within 0.5 IΔn-IΔn (150-300 mA) \nfor the frequency range 50-1000 Hz.

The model was prepared and tested for primary current equal to 220 mA – it is \nclose to the geometric mean value of the range  of 150-300 mA. The results of the test are \npresented in Fig. 10. \nFig. 11, in turn, presents the peak values of the secondary voltage in relation to a reference \nvalue of 50 Hz, for easy comparison with the values presented in Fig. 5 and Fig. 8. In this case \n(Fig. 11) the rise of the secondary voltage is even higher than in Fig. 8. It is favorable \nbehaviour of the current transformer. \nAn electromechanical relay was connected to the secondary circuit of such designed re-\nsidual current transformer. According to the above presented assumption, this arrangement \nshould be able to trip within 150-300 mA for the frequency range 50-1000 Hz. A tripping \ncharacteristic of this arrangemen t is presented in Fig. 12. Permissible values of the tripping \ncurrent are marked as a shaded area. \nVol.  66 (2017)            Improving sensitivity of residual CT to HF earth fault currents 491 \nThe tripping current of the laboratory model of the RCD is within the permissible range \nonly for frequencies 50-500 Hz, in spite of the favorable rise of the induced secondary voltage \n(Fig. 11). The cause of too high values of the tripping current within the frequency range  \n500-1000 Hz lies in the construction of the el ectromechanical relay. The electromechanical \nrelay usually comprises a permanent magnet and a coil. \n \n-6\n-4\n-2\n0\n2\n4\n6\n-0.02 -0.015 -0.01 -0.005 0 0.005 0.01 0.015 0.02\ntime (s)\nes(t) (V)\nsecondary voltage\n(a) \n-10\n-8\n-6\n-4\n-2\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n-0.02 -0.015 -0.01 -0.05 0 0.005 0.01 0.015 0.02\ntime (s)\nes(t) (V)\nsecondary voltage\n \n(b) \n \n-15\n-10\n-5\n0\n5\n10\n15\n-0.02 -0.015 -0.01 -0.005 0 0.005 0.01 0.015 0.02\ntime (s)\nes(t) (V)\nsecondary voltage\n(c) \n \n-25\n-20\n-15\n-10\n-5\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n-0.01 -0.005 0 0.005 0.01\ntime (s)\nes(t) (V)\nsecondary voltage\n \n(d) \nFig. 10.

The higher the frequency of the secondary \ncurrent the higher the impedance of the electromechanical relay. In order to avoid the effect of \na high frequency waveform on electromechanical relay, an AC/DC converter in the secondary \ncircuit of the current transformer may be used (Fig. 13) [17].  \nAfter the application of the mentioned AC/DC converter, a tripping characteristic of the \narrangement was checked again (Fig. 14). In th is case the characteristic is favorable for the \nwhole tested frequency range (50-1000 Hz). \nSensitivity of residual current devices is de termined, among others, by the frequency-re-\nsponse of both the current transformer and the electromechanical relay. With the AC/DC con-\nverter, the relay responds to the DC current only, no matter what frequency (harmonics) the \nprimary (also secondary) current has.

Conclusions \n \nMost of commonly used residual current devices do not detect a high frequency earth fault \ncurrent properly. The re liable operation of RCDs for such a current strictly depends on the \nproperties of the residual current transformer applied in the RCDs. The process of selection of \nthis transformer and its coordination with other elements of RCDs should take into account the \nfrequency range of the earth fault current to be detected. The above proposed modifications of \nthe residual current transformer improves operation of residual current devices when a high \nfrequency earth fault current flows. \n \n \nReferences \n  [1] HD 60364-4-41, Low-voltage electrical installations – Part 4-41: Protection for safety – Protection \nagainst electric shock (2007). \n  [2] Czapp S., The effect of earth fault current harmonics on tripping of residual current devices , \nProceedings of the International School on Nons inusoidal Currents and Compensation, IX Con-\nference-Seminar ISNCC 2008, Lagow, Poland (2008), DOI: 10.1109/ISNCC.2008.4627489. \n  [3] Czapp S., Comparison of residual current devices tri pping characteristics for selected residual \ncurrent waveforms, Elektronika ir Elektrotechnika, vol. 100, no. 4, pp. 7-10 (2010). \n  [4] Czapp S., Borowski K., Immunity of residual curre nt devices to the impul se leakage current in \ncircuits with variable speed drives, Elektronika ir Elektrotechnika, vol. 19, no. 8, pp. 15-18 (2013), \nDOI: 10.5755/j01.eee.19.8.2883. \n  [5] Donahue, S.T., Storm C.L., Wetz Jr. D.A., Lee W.-J., Study of the effects of  smart meter RF trans-\nmissions on GFCI outlets , IEEE Transactions on Electromagne tic Compatibility, vol. 56, no. 6, \npp. 1361-1369 (2014), DOI: 10.1109/TEMC.2014.2354016. \n  [6] Freschi F., High-frequency behavior of  residual current devices , IEEE Transactions on Power \nDelivery, vol. 27, no. 3, pp. 1629-1635 (2012), DOI: 10.1109/TPWRD.2012.2191423. \n  [7] Lee T.M., Chan T.W., The effects of harmonics on the opera tional characteristics of residual cur-\nrent circuit breakers , International Conference on Energy  Management and Po wer Delivery, Pro-\nceedings of EMPD’95, pp. 715-719 (1995), DOI: 10.1109/EMPD.1995.500786. \n  [8] Luo X., Du Y., Wang X.H., Chen M.L., Tripping characteristics of residual current devices under \nnonsinusoidal currents, IEEE Transactions on Industry Appl ications, vol. 47, no. 3, pp. 1515-1521 \n(2011), DOI: 10.1109/TIA.2011.2125939. \n  [9] Roldan-Porta C., Escriva-Escriva G., Cárcel-Carrasco F.
