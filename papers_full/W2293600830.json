    "full_text": "Effects of dividing attention on memory for declarative\nand procedural aspects of tool use\nShumita Roy1 & Norman W. Park 1\nPublished online: 7 March 2016\n# Psychonomic Society, Inc. 2016\nAbstract Tool-related knowledge and skills are supported by\na complex set of memory processes that are not well under-\nstood. Some aspects of tools are mediated by either declarative\nor procedural memory, while other aspects may rely on an\ninteraction of both systems. Although motor skill learning is\nbelieved to be primarily supported by procedural memory,\nthere is debate in the current literature regarding the role of\ndeclarative memory. Growing evidence suggests that declara-\ntive memory may be involved during early stages of motor\nskill learning, although findings have been mixed. In the cur-\nrent experiment, healthy, younger adults were trained to use a\nset of novel complex tools and were tested on their memory\nfor various aspects of the tools. Declarative memory\nencoding was interrupted by dividing attention during\ntraining. Findings showed that dividing attention during\ntraining was detrimental for subsequent memory for tool\nattributes as well as accurate demonstration of tool use and\ntool grasping. However, dividing attention did not interfere\nwith motor skill learning, suggesting that declarative mem-\nory is not essential for skill l earning associated with tools.\nKeywords Declarative memory . Procedural memory .\nAttention . Tool use\nAs humans, we have developed customized tools for almost\nevery function in our lives, whether it is to shave with a razor,\nflip an egg with a spatula, or cut paper with scissors. These\nmanufactured tools, which are designed to provide a mechan-\nical advantage in interacting with action recipients, are re-\nferred to as complex tools. Simple tools , in contrast, only am-\nplify the movement of upper limbs (e.g., extending reach with\na stick; Frey, 2007; Heilman, 2002). We learn how to use\nvarious complex tools throughout our lives and become heavi-\nly dependent on them to perform daily activities. Thus, the\nability to use such tools is critical for independent living.\nHowever, as a result of certain neurological conditions, some\npeople are left unable to use tools that they may have used\nproficiently in the past. In some cases, these individuals may\nalso be unable to learn how to use new tools to perform new\nfunctions. These devastating impairments can impact one ’s\nability to live independently, and it has been shown that a lack\nof independent living is associated with poor quality of life\n(Foundas, Macauley, Raymer, & Maher, 1995). Yet we do not\nhave a clear understanding of how people learn to use novel\ntools and how different aspects of tool-related knowledge and\nskills are represented in the brain.\nThe current experiment was conducted as an extension\nto two previous patient studies that investigated the mem-\nory representations of complex tool-related knowledge and\nskills. In Roy and Park ( 2010), an individual with hippo-\ncampal amnesia, associated with profound declarative\nmemory impairment, was shown to have unimpaired motor\nskill learning but severely impaired memory for tool attri-\nbutes and tool grasping. In a subsequent study (Roy, Park,\nRoy, & Almeida, 2015), patients with Parkinson ’s disease,\nassociated with striatal dysfunction and procedural memo-\nry impairment, were found to have impaired motor skill\nlearning, but intact memory for tool attributes and tool\ngrasping. Interestingly, skilled use of a tool to a command\nwas impaired in both patient groups. Taken together, these\ntwo studies present evidence of double dissociation of the\n* Shumita Roy\nshumita@yorku.ca\n* Norman W.

Specifically, they suggest that memory for tool attri-\nbutes and tool grasping is primarily declarative, whereas\nmotor skill acquisition and skilled tool use may involve an\ninteraction of both declarative and procedural memory sys-\ntems. However, the nature of these interactions and the\nrelative contribution of each memory system are still un-\nknown. Furthermore, findings from these studies are based\non performance of individuals with damage to particular\nmemory systems (i.e., amnesia, Parkinson ’s disease [PD]).\nThus, it is unclear how tool-related knowledge and skills\nare represented in healthy, cognitively unimpaired individ-\nuals and whether these representations are consistent with\nearlier patient studies. The cu rrent study investigated mem-\nory for tool knowledge and skills in a healthy sample of\nindividuals using a divided attention paradigm as a means\nof selectively interfering with declarative memory process-\nes. A brief review of human memory systems, memory\nrepresentations of tool-related knowledge and skills, and\neffects of divided attention on memory is provided, follow-\ned by an overview of the current study.\nHuman memory systems\nIt is generally accepted that memory is not a unitary construct\nbut that there are multiple memory systems represented in\ndifferent parts of the brain (see Squire, 2009). The most com-\nmon distinction is made between declarative memory and pro-\ncedural memory.Declarative memoryincludes knowledge that\nis often consciously retrieved and it includes both semantic\n(i.e., general knowledge) and episodic (i.e., recollection of per-\nsonal experiences) memory. Declarative memory is believed to\nrely on the medial temporal lobes, including the hippocampus\nand related structures (Moscovitch, Nadel, Winocur, Gilboa, &\nRosenbaum,2006). Procedural memory, in contrast, is a form\nof nondeclarative memory that is involved in incremental\nlearning of motor skills and cognitive habits (Squire, 2009).\nProcedural learning is believed to take place implicitly, without\ndemands for attentional resources (Reber,1993). Although it is\nbelieved that the frontal-striatal system plays a critical role in\nsupporting procedural memory, other brain regions, such as the\ncerebellum, have also been implicated (see Doyon et al., 2009;\nPenhune & Steele, 2012; also see Shohamy, Myers, Kalanithi,\n& Gluck, 2008). Thus, declarative and procedural memory\nsystems are anatomically and functionally dissociable (see\nKnowlton, Mangels, & Squire, 1996).\nAlthough early memory research tended to investigate each\nmemory system in isolation based on the assumption that they\nare distinct, a growing body of research suggests that the two\nsystems may function interactively. The nature of the interac-\ntion appears to vary as well. Studies have provided evidence\nfor cooperative interaction, competitive interaction, and\ncompensatory interaction between the two systems. It has\nbeen proposed that the two systems are cooperative, or com-\nplementary, in that they are both required, but each system has\na different role in supporting performance (McClelland,\nMcNaughton, & O ’Reilly, 1995). Evidence of a competitive\nrelationship between declarative and procedural memory can\nbe found in the domain of motor skill acquisition. It has been\nargued that whereas motor skill acquisition is primarily medi-\nated by procedural memory, the declarative memory system\nmay interfere with procedural learning in early stages of learn-\ning (Brown & Robertson, 2007). Last, in a compensatory\ninteraction, the system that typically mediates performance\nis compromised, and the intact system is recruited to support\nperformance (Moody, Bookheimer, Vanek, & Knowlton,\n2004). Thus, the concept of two fully independent memory\nsystems may be outdated, and recent research suggests that the\nnature of interaction between the two systems actually varies\nacross different domains and forms of learning (for a review,\nsee Foerde & Shohamy, 2011).\nMemory representations of tool-related knowledge\nand skills\nDeclarative memory and tools\nLearning how to use a novel complex tool requires one to\nlearn about characteristics of the tool (e.g., perceptual features\nof the tool, knowledge of its function, how it is grasped).\nPrevious research suggests that information about tools and\ntheir properties depend on regions associated with declarative\nmemory (Roy & Park, 2010; Warrington & Shallice, 1984;\nWeisberg, van Turennout, & Martin, 2007). Individuals with\nmedial temporal lobe damage are impaired in their memory\nfor object-specific information (Hodges, Bozeat, Lambon\nRalph, Patterson, & Spatt, 2000; Warrington, 1975). The de-\nclarative memory system has also been shown to be critical in\nmediating tool grasping for use (Creem & Proffitt, 2001;\nCreem-Regehr & Lee, 2005; though, see Goldenberg &\nSpatt, 2009). In a behavioral study, Creem and Proffitt\n(2001) showed that healthy participants were less likely to\ngrasp familiar tools appropriately, by their handles, when they\nconcurrently performed a semantic secondary task compared\nto when they performed a visuomotor secondary task. The\nauthors concluded that grasping a tool for the purpose of\nusing it, but not simply moving it, requires semantic\nknowledge about the tool. In a subsequent neuroimaging\nstudy, Creem-Regehr and Lee ( 2005) reported greater acti-\nvation in the middle temporal gyrus and fusiform gyrus for\nimages of familiar tools with handles compared to unfamiliar\ngraspable shapes, suggesting that functional knowledge of\ntools influences neural representations associated with grasp-\ning the tool for use. In Roy and Park ( 2010), an amnesic\n728 Mem Cogn (2016) 44:727 –739\nindividual, who was trained to use a set of novel complex\ntools, was severely impaired in his ability to recall the proper\nmanner of grasping for these tools when subsequently tested.\nThus, previous research with both novel and familiar tools\nsuggests that grasping a tool in order to use it requires declar-\native knowledge of the tool.\nProcedural memory and tools\nIt is generally accepted that motor skill learning relies primar-\nily on the procedural memory system. It is believed that the\nbasal ganglia and related structures, particularly the striatum,\nplay a critical role in supporting motor skill acquisition and\nretention (Doyon et al., 2009). Disease of these brain regions\nhas been associated with impaired procedural memory.\nIndividuals with Parkinson ’s disease are impaired on proce-\ndural memory tasks, such as probabilistic classification learn-\ning and motor sequence learning (Knowlton et al., 1996;\nSiegert, Taylor, Weatherall, & Abernethy, 2006; Wilkinson,\nKhan, & Jahanshahi, 2009). Conversely, a study with the fa-\nmous amnesic individual, H. M., showed that while he had\nprofound declarative memory impairment due to medial tem-\nporal lobe damage, he was able to learn how to use a stylus to\nperform a mirror tracing task. He became progressively faster\non this task and retained performance on this task even after\n1y e a r( C o r k i n ,1968; Gabrieli, Corkin, Mickel & Growdon,\n1993). Nonetheless, there is some debate regarding the role of\ndeclarative memory in motor skill learning.\nInteraction of declarative and procedural memory\nand tools\nSome investigators have argued that motor skill learning may\ninvolve a competitive interaction of declarative and procedur-\nal memory. In this interaction, declarative memory competes\nwith procedural memory during early stages of motor skill\nlearning and creates a naturally occurring impediment in\nlearning. Similarly, when the declarative system is disengaged\nfrom the process, motor skill learning is enhanced (Brown &\nRobertson, 2007). Others have argued that declarative mem-\nory has a facilitative role in early stages of motor skill learning\nand that a cooperative interaction of both systems is required\n(see Penhune & Steele, 2012). There is also evidence of a\ncompensatory interaction in which the declarative system\nmay become more involved in supporting motor skill learning\nwhen the procedural system is compromised (Gobel et al.,\n2013). Thus, although procedural memory may have the pri-\nmary role in mediating motor skill learning, declarative mem-\nory may be involved in some capacity during early learning.\nThe precise nature of this interaction between the two memory\nsystems requires further investigation.\nIn addition to motor skill learning, it has been proposed that\nskilled tool use (i.e., intentional tool use) relies on a\ncooperative interaction of both declarative and procedural\nmemory systems (Negri, Lunardelli, Gigli, & Rumiati, 2007;\nRoy et al., 2015; Silveri & Ciccarelli, 2009). In Roy and Park\n(2010), an amnesic individual, D. A., showed unimpaired mo-\ntor skill acquisition associated with novel complex tools but\nwas unable to demonstrate the use of these tools to command.\nYet, when the tool’s recipient (i.e., the object that the tool acts\non) was positioned in its appropriate starting location by the\nexperimenter, his ability to use the tools improved remarkably.\nThis finding suggests that declarative memory is critical for\nrecalling contextual information related to the task, whereas\nprocedural memory is critical for skilled enactment of the\nmotor skill. Individuals with PD were tested in a similar ex-\nperiment in which they were trained to use a set of novel\ncomplex tools and were subsequently tested on their ability\nto demonstrate tool use to command (Roy et al., 2015).\nResults showed that while participants with PD had no diffi-\nculty in performing components of the tasks accurately, they\ndid not retain their speed of task completion after a 3-week\ndelay. Based on these two patient studies, it could be argued\nthat skilled tool use relies on a cooperative interaction of both\ndeclarative and procedural memory systems.\nEffects of dividing attention on memory\nEffects of dividing attention on declarative memory\nThe general consensus in the literature is that encoding infor-\nmation into declarative memory requires attentional resources\nand that dividing attention at study has a negative effect on\nsubsequent declarative memory performance (Fernandes &\nMoscovitch, 2013). It is believed that both primary and sec-\nondary tasks compete for common attentional resources,\nwhich disrupts encoding of new associations into declarative\nmemory. Medial temporal lobe structures, along with regions\nin the prefrontal cortex, are involved during encoding (Chun\n& Turk-Browne, 2007). The majority of research investigat-\ning effects of divided attention on declarative memory in-\nvolves learning of verbal stimuli (e.g., list learning). Few stud-\nies have examined the effects of divided attention on memory\nfor skilled actions or knowledge related to tools. Research in\nour lab has studied the effects of divided attention on learning\nof novel naturalistic actions (NNAs), which are arts and crafts\ntype of tasks involving use of everyday objects to create an\nend product (e.g., building a mock volcano using a plastic\nbottle, baking soda, and other objects). Results showed that\ndividing attention when participants were viewing a video\ndemonstration of the NNA task impaired the ability of partic-\nipants to construct the viewed NNA from memory in compar-\nison to the full attention condition. Based on these findings, it\nwas argued that encoding the steps associated with performing\nan NNA requires declarative memory (Gold & Park, 2008).\nMem Cogn (2016) 44:727 –739 729\nEffects of dividing attention on procedural memory\nThe effects of divided attention on procedural memory are not\nwell understood at this time, and findings on the attentional\ndemands of procedural learning have been mixed. Early re-\nsearchers in this area showed a decrement in motor sequence\nlearning under divided attention and attributed this impair-\nment to a lack of sufficient attentional resources (Nissen &\nBullemer,1987). This argument was subsequently challenged,\nand it was proposed that it is not learning per se that is affected\nby dividing attention; rather, performance or behavioral ex-\npression of the learned skill is affected. It was demonstrated\nthat when a skill trained under divided attention was subse-\nquently enacted under full attention, performance was equiv-\nalent for both full and divided attention conditions (Frensch,\nLin, & Buchner, 1998). Although the serial reaction time task\n(SRTT) is perhaps the most widely used primary task in these\nstudies, studies using other procedural learning tasks, such as\npursuit rotor and probabilistic classification learning tasks,\nhave shown that performance, and not learning, was affected\nby dividing attention (Eysenck & Thompson, 1966;F o e r d e ,\nPoldrack, & Knowlton, 2007).\nIn some circumstances, dividing attention may also en-\nhance motor learning. It has been suggested that features of\nthe secondary task influence whether motor sequence learning\nwill be impaired or enhanced. A study showed that partici-\npants retained a perceptual-motor task better under difficult\nrather than easy dual-task conditions (Roche et al., 2007).\nThe authors argued that the more difficult secondary task mo-\nbilized greater attentional resources. Motor sequence learning\nmay also be enhanced when the secondary task is similar in\nnature to the primary task. Findings from one study suggested\nthat when the primary and secondary tasks draw on common\ncognitive processes, skill learning is enhanced, whereas when\nthey rely on different cognitive processes, skill learning is\nimpaired (Goh, Sullivan, Gordon, Wulf, & Winstein, 2012).\nThus, the effects of dividing attention on procedural memory\nare complex and warrant further study, especially given the\nlack of research with tool-related skilled actions.\nOverview\nAs described earlier, it has been proposed that memory for tool\nproperties is primarily mediated by declarative memory pro-\ncesses, and motor skill learning is primarily dependent on\nprocedural memory. It has also been suggested that motor skill\nlearning and skilled tool use may rely on an interaction of both\nmemory systems. Specifically, it was argued that skilled tool\nuse relies on a cooperative interaction of both declarative and\nprocedural memory systems. With respect to motor skill learn-\ning, the degree to which declarative memory is involved is\nunclear. Dividing attention is believed to selectively disrupt\nencoding of new information into declarative memory.\nTherefore, this behavioral technique may be useful in deter-\nmining whether or not encoding of declarative task knowledge\nis critical during motor skill learning with complex tools. To\nour knowledge, no previous studies have directly investigated\nthe effect of dividing attention on learning of motor skills and\nknowledge associated with complex tools. Findings regarding\nmemory representations of other aspects of tool knowledge\nand skills (i.e., tool features, skilled tool use) were largely\nconsistent across our two earlier patient studies discussed;\nhowever, it is important to note that these previous findings\nare based on patient performance. As such, the degree of gen-\neralizability to a healthy population is not known. Thus, if\nconverging evidence were obtained in a healthy population,\nit would provide additional support of the proposed roles of\ndeclarative and procedural memory in mediating tool-related\nknowledge and skills.\nThe current study investigated the nature of interaction be-\ntween declarative and procedural memory on tool-related\nknowledge and skills with the use of a dual-task paradigm.\nHealthy younger adults were trained to use a set of novel\ncomplex tools by viewing a brief video demonstrating correct\nperformance of all aspects of the task. Subsequently, their\nmemory for tool features (e.g., function, color), tool grasping,\nand skilled tool use to command was tested. Some of the tools\nwere trained under divided attention as a means of disrupting\nencoding of declarative information related to tools and their\nuses. In general, it was expected that divided attention during\ntraining would be detrimental for memory of any aspect of\ntool-related knowledge that relied on declarative memory,\nbut that there would be no impact on aspects supported pri-\nmarily by procedural memory. Four hypotheses were tested in\nthe current study:\n1. Motor skill learning is believed to be a form of procedural\nmemory and should therefore not be impaired by dividing\nattention. Specifically, it was hypothesized that the rate of\nmotor skill learning associated with complex tools, as\nassessed by training completion time, would not differ\nbetween full and divided attention conditions. Based on\nfindings from Roy and Park, it is reasonable to believe\nthat declarative memory is not required for motor skill\nlearning. However, given the lack of consensus among\nprevious studies, it is possible that motor skill learning\nmay suffer if encoding of task knowledge is disrupted\nby dividing attention which would be reflective of a co-\noperative interaction of declarative and procedural mem-\nory systems. It is also possible that motor skill learning\ninvolves a competitive interaction between these memory\nsystems. If so, it would be expected that skill learning\nwould be faster in the divided attention condition com-\npared to full attention.\n2. Recall of tool features should be impaired for tools that\nwere trained under divided compared to full attention.\n730 Mem Cogn (2016) 44:727 –739\nThis hypothesis is based on research showing that divid-\ning attention is detrimental to learning of declarative in-\nformation (e.g., Iidaka, Anderson, Kapur, Cabeza, &\nCraik, 2000) and findings from Roy and Park ( 2010).\n3. Demonstration of tool grasping should be impaired for\ntools trained under divided compared to full attention\nbased on research showing that tool grasping has a strong\ndeclarative component (Creem & Proffitt, 2001;R o y&\nPark, 2010).\n4. It is argued that tool-use accuracy relies on encoding of\ntask-related details and should therefore be impaired for\ntools trained under divided compared to full attention.\nHowever, if these task-related details are successfully\nencoded, allowing for accurate tool use, there should be\nno difference in completion time between attention con-\nditions. This hypothesis is based on the previous findings\nsuggesting that skilled tool use relies on a cooperative\ninteraction of both memory systems, such that declarative\nmemory mediates recall of knowledge related to using a\ntool and procedural memory mediates motor efficiency of\ntool use.\nMethod\nParticipants\nThirty-two younger adults (22 females, 10 males) between the\nages of 18 and 33 years ( M = 23.81 years, SD =3 . 8 8y e a r s )\nparticipated in the current study. Participants were recruited\nand tested at York University in Toronto, Canada. They were\nrecruited through the York University undergraduate research\npool and through flyers posted in various locations on cam-\npus. Participants from the research pool were granted course\ncredits for their participation, and participants who responded\nto flyers were offered a nominal amount of monetary compen-\nsation. All participants were required to be right-handed, flu-\nent in spoken and written English (learned English by age 5),\nand have at least 12 years of education. Exclusion criteria\nincluded color-blindness, past head injury resulting in loss of\nconsciousness, and any psychological, neurological, or seri-\nous medical illness that could potentially affect cognition or\nmotor performance. The experiment was approved by the\nethics review board at York University, and each participant\nprovided written consent prior to participation.\nMaterials\nNovel tools Twelve novel complex tools were constructed\nfrom K ’NEX, a commercial children ’s construction toy (see\nFig. 1). These 12 tools were divided into four sets of three\ntools each (Sets A, B, C, and D). The tools used in the current\nstudy were a subset of 15 tools that were developed by Roy\nand Park (2010). Each tool was designed to perform a specific\nfunction by interacting with a unique action recipient (e.g.,\nguide a wheel down a curved path). Tools were designed to\nbe used unimanually, with the right hand, and each tool task\ninvolved a distinct motor skill. As demonstrated in Roy and\nPark ( 2010), the tools were designed in such a manner that\ntheir function, manner of use, and manner of grasping could\nnot be determined from physical appearance. Each tool was\npainted a different solid color. A set of tests was also devel-\noped to assess memory for various aspects of the tools (e.g.,\nknowledge of the tool ’s function, manner of grasp). A brief\ntraining video was created for each tool, demonstrating how\nthe tool is grasped, how it is manipulated, and how the task is\nperformed from start to finish. Each video also contained an\naudio track that provided verbal descriptions of the task.\nFurther details on these materials, and the tests developed to\nassess performance described next, can be found in Roy and\nPark (2010).\nRecall test A set of gray-scale images of the tools was used to\ndevelop a recall test of tool attributes. Three photographs of\neach tool were taken from three different, approximately equi-\ndistant, angles. During the recall test, participants were shown\nthe three pictures of each tool, one tool at a time, and were\nasked to answer the following five questions about each tool:\n(1) What is the function of the tool/What is it used for? (2)\nFig. 1 Examples of novel complex tools used in the current experiment\nMem Cogn (2016) 44:727 –739 731\nWhat is the color of the actual physical tool? (3) What is the\nrecipient that the tool interacts with? (4) What is the color of\nthe recipient? and (5) How many recipients does the tool act\non? Participants were asked to verbally provide their re-\nsponses, which the experimenter recorded verbatim.\nGrasp-to-command testEach tool was placed on the table in\nfront of the participant without its associated recipient(s). The\nparticipant was instructed, BWith your right hand, show me\nhow you would grasp this tool if you were to use it. Show me\nthe first thing that comes to mind. ^ The participant was\nallowed to rotate the tool in order to make the handle more\naccessible. After the participant demonstrated the grasp, the\nparticipant was asked to release the tool.\nUse-to-command test After the participant demonstrated the\ngrasp of a tool, the experimenter set up the entire task with all\nassociated materials. The tool was positioned in front of the\nparticipant in the proper orientation for use, and the recipi-\nent(s) was placed in a small outlined square, to the left of the\ntool. The participant was instructed, BAgain, using your right\nhand, I’d like you to show me how you would use the tool. ^\nParticipants were expected to first position the recipient in the\ncorrect starting location. Then, they were given a limit of\n60 seconds to demonstrate correct use of the tool from start\nto finish. Timing began when the tool made contact with the\nrecipient and ended when either the task was completed with-\nout error or when the time limit was up.\nLag-1 task An auditory lag-1 task was created. The lag-1 task\nwas chosen as a secondary task as it has been shown to draw\non working memory and attentional processes (see Dobbs &\nRule, 1989). In this lag-1 task, an audio file of spoken num-\nbers was played on a laptop. During pilot testing, it was de-\ntermined that a lag-1 task, presented at a 2-second rate (i.e.,\none number every 2 seconds) was sufficiently challenging\nwithout overwhelming participants. In the task, participants\nwere told to repeat out loud the number that preceded the last\nnumber they heard. For example, for the sequence,\nB5......6......2....,^ after hearing B6,^ the participant would say\nB5.^ In total, 10 lag-1 files were created, each with a different,\nrandom, sequence of numbers. One of these files was 20 sec-\nonds in length and was used as a practice file. The other nine\nfiles were each 5 minutes in length and were used during\ntraining of tool tasks.\nDesign and procedure\nEach participant was tested individually in a single session\nlasting approximately 90 minutes. The session was composed\nof two phases: training and test. Half of the tools were trained\nunder full attention (FA) as in the traditional manner of\nperforming the tasks (see Roy & Park, 2010), and the other\nhalf were trained under divided attention (DA). Thus, each\nparticipant was trained in both FA and DA conditions.\nParticipants were trained to use all 12 tools (i.e., all four sets),\none tool at a time. As an example, as shown in Appendix,\nParticipant 1 was trained on sets A and B under FA and on\nsets C and D under DA. Out of the two sets in each attention\ncondition, one set (e.g., Set A) was trained over four consec-\nutive trials (i.e., T1, T2, T3, and the probe trial) to provide a\nmeasure of training performance. The other tool set (e.g., Set\nB) served as the test set and was trained on a single trial.\n1 The\ncombination of attention conditions and tool sets resulted in\nfour training conditions (i.e., FA –training set, FA –test set,\nDA–training set, and DA –test set). The order of these training\nconditions was fully counterbalanced across participants. It\nshould be noted that all components of the test phase were\nconducted under full atten tion for all participants (see\nAppendix for experimental design).\nTraining At the start of the session, participants were given\ninstructions for the lag-1 task and were given a brief practice\ntrial with a 20-second lag-1 file. Errors were corrected and, if\nnecessary, instructions were repeated to ensure that partici-\npants fully understood the task. After the practice trial, one\nof the other eight lag-1 files was played at random, and the\nparticipant performed the lag-1 task for the first 60 seconds of\nthe clip. This 60-second trial served as the pretraining measure\nof performance on the lag-1 task.\nAfter measuring pretraining performance on the lag-1 task,\nparticipants were given practice on the tool tasks. Before be-\nginning with the 12 experimental tools, participants were giv-\nen two practice training trials, one for each attention condition,\nwith two different tools. These tools had no similarity to the 12\nexperimental tools (e.g., different colors, functions, manner of\ngrasp). Before proceeding to the experimental training trials, it\nwas ensured that participants understood all instructions, and\nclarification was provided if necessary. During training of a\ntool task, participants were told that they would have up to\n60 seconds to try and perform each tool task in the same way\nas it had been performed in the video as quickly as possible,\nwithout making any errors, and that they should restart the\ntask if they made an error.\nBefore training with each tool, a divider was placed on the\ntable to hide the tool and its associated recipient(s) from the\nparticipant’s view. However, a small section of the divider in\nfront of the participant ’s right hand was cut out. The partici-\npant’s right hand came through this small space and rested on\nthe table throughout the duration of the training phase. The\nexperimenter placed the tool into the participant ’s right hand\n1 During pilot testing, it was found that four consecutive training trials\ncountered the effects of dividing attention on the subsequent recall test.\nThe effects of dividing attention appeared to diminish after repeated ex-\nposure to tool attributes over trials. For this reason, tools presented in the\ntest phase were only given a single training trial.\n732 Mem Cogn (2016) 44:727 –739\nand positioned the participant ’s fingers in the correct config-\nuration for use. Thus, participants could feel the tool but could\nnot yet see it. The tool was hidden from view to prevent\nparticipants from visually encoding physical attributes of the\ntool before beginning the task, especially as this initial set-up\nprocedure takes place without the secondary task in the divid-\ned attention condition. The purpose of configuring grasp on\nthe tool prior to the video was to allow the participant to begin\nthe task immediately after watching the video. Participants\nwere instructed to continue to grasp the tool until they had\ncompleted training with that particular tool. Once the partici-\npant’s hand was positioned on the tool, the experimenter ver-\nbally described the type of errors that could be made in the\ntask, which would require the participant to restart the task\n(e.g., BIn this task, if the recipient falls off the tool onto the\ntable, the task has to be restarted ^). However, these descrip-\ntions did not provide any specific information about the tool ’s\nuse or its features. Although these details are normally provid-\ned in the tool videos, the videos were muted for this experi-\nment to prevent auditory interference with the lag-1 task.\nAfter receiving instructions about potential task errors, par-\nticipants viewed the associated training video, with the tool\nand its recipient(s) still hidden from view. Participants were\ninstructed not to maneuver the tool, or try to perform the task,\nwhile the video was playing. Immediately after the video fin-\nished playing, the experimenter removed the divider and ges-\ntured for the participant to begin the task. Timing began when\nthe tool made contact with the recipient and ended once an\nerrorless trial was completed, or when the 60-second time\nlimit was up. Once the participant had completed training with\na tool, the experimenter removed it from the table, placed the\ncardboard divider back on the table, and positioned the next\ntool into the participant ’s right hand.\nTraining in the DA condition was the same as in the FA\ncondition except that there was a lag-1 secondary task, which\nstarted immediately prior to the training video, before the di-\nvider was removed. Participants were instructed to stop\nperforming the secondary task either after completing the task\nsuccessfully or when the 60-second time limit elapsed if they\nwere unable to complete the task. Participants were encour-\naged to do their best on both the lag-1 task and the tool task,\nbut to treat the lag-1 task as the more important task in order to\ndraw attention away from the tool task. A different lag-1 set\nwas selected for each of the six tools in the DA condition. For\nthe training set, in which tools were trained over four consec-\nutive trials, the lag-1 task was turned off after Trial 3, and the\ntask was performed one more time under full attention for the\nprobe trial. For the test set, in which tools were trained on a\nsingle trial, the lag-1 task was turned off once the trial was\ncompleted and all materials related to the tool were removed\nfrom the participant’sv i e w .\nThe experimenter did not provide any verbal feedback to\nparticipants during training in order to limit interference in the\nDA condition. However, participants were instructed before-\nhand that the experimenter would tap on the desk if the par-\nticipant made an error and did not restart the task. This gesture\nwould signal the participant to start over. Also, participants\nwere informed before the introduction of each tool whether\nit would be trained under FA or DA and whether it would be\ntrained over four trials or one trial.\nAfter completing training of the 12 tools, all participants\nperformed the lag-1 task on its own to assess posttraining\nperformance. The remaining lag-1 file was played, and partic-\nipants performed the task for 60 seconds. After performing the\nlag-1 task, participants were given a 3-minute break during\nwhich they worked on a dinosaur word search as a distracter\ntask. The purpose of this distracter task was to give the partic-\nipant a brief break from the experiment and to keep them\nengaged with a pleasant but unrelated task.\nTest After completing the training phase, the test phase was\nadministered, which included the recall, grasp-to-command,\nand use-to-command test measures. Only tools that were giv-\nen a single training trial (i.e., test set) during training were\nincluded in the test phase. Thus, three tools from the FA con-\ndition and three tools from the DA condition were included in\nthe test (see Appendix).\nScoring and statistical analyses\nThe following scoring procedures were implemented for all\nmeasures. Interrater reliability is also presented for measures\nthat do not have an objective scoring system and therefore\nmay have required experimenter judgment. Interrater scores\nreflect the percentage of agreement between the two raters for\na given measure. Further details on scoring procedures can be\nfound in Roy and Park ( 2010).\nTwo aspects of training performance were recorded: com-\npletion time and number of errors. Completion time reflects\nthe time of the single errorless attempt, from the moment the\ntool made contact with receipt to successful completion of the\ntask. If a participant was unable to complete the task success-\nfully within 60 seconds, a maximum score of 60 seconds was\nrecorded. The number of errors made during each task was\ntallied.\nPerformance on the recall test was measured as the percent-\nage of correct responses to items in each test trial. Recall items\nwere divided into two conceptual categories, functional\nassociativeand perceptual.T h i sc l a s s i f i c a t i o ni sb a s e do ne a r -\nlier research by Warrington and Shallice ( 1984) that distin-\nguished between functional associative and perceptual fea-\ntures of living and nonliving objects. This classification was\nalso used to report detailed results on recall data in Roy and\nPa\nrk ( 2010). The functional associative category included\nfunctionally relevant tool features including function of the\ntool and the identity of the recipient on which it performs\nMem Cogn (2016) 44:727 –739 733\nthe function. In contrast, perceptual recall items referred to\nincidental physical attributes, such as tool color, recipient col-\nor, and number of recipients. During initial development of\nthe novel tools and associated memory tests, a pilot study was\nconducted with a sample of healthy younger adults to refine\nthe memory measures. Based on the responses provided by\nthese participants, a scoring rubric of acceptable responses for\nthe recall test was developed and has been used in subsequent\nstudies with these tools (Roy & Park, 2010; Roy et al., 2015).\nGrasp-to-command performance was scored as the per-\ncentage of correct grasp demonstrations to command in each\ntest trial. Each correct demonstration was given one point. As\ndescribed earlier, each tool has a unique functional manner of\ngrasping that participants learn during the training phase. A\nsecond independent rater scored 30 % of the data, and an\ninterrater reliability score of 94.9 % was obtained for grasp-\nto-command.\nPerformance on the use-to-command test can be broken\ndown into two components, accuracy and completion time.\nTool use accuracy was measured as the percentage of correct\ntool use demonstrations to command (i.e., whether or not a\nparticipant was able to complete the task successfully within\n60 seconds), whereas completion time provided a measure of\nhow quickly the participant was able to complete the task, in\nseconds. In terms of accuracy, if a participant was able to\naccurately demonstrate the tool ’s use within the 60-second\ntime limit, the demonstration was scored as correct, and one\npoint was given. If the task was performed incorrectly, or was\nnot completed within the 60-second time limit, the demonstra-\ntion was marked as incorrect and a score of zero was given. A\nsecond independent rater scored 30 % of the data, and an\ninterrater reliability score of 98.3 % was obtained for use-to-\ncommand accuracy. Completion time for use-to-command\nperformance was measured in the same manner as in training.\nParametric statistics were used to analyze all measures of\nperformance. Analysis of motor skill acquisition was based on\ntools trained over four trials during training. Analysis of all\nother measures, including recall of tool attributes, grasp-to-\ncommand, and use-to-command, was based on tools trained\non a single trial (i.e., the test set). All pairwise comparisons\nwere performed using Bonferroni correction, and raw, unad-\njusted, p values are reported.\nResults\nBaseline performance\nTo ensure that tool attributes, proper manner of grasping, and\nproper manner of use could not be inferred by either appear-\nance or handling of the tools, a brief baseline study was con-\nducted prior to the current experiment. Baseline performance\nof all measures was obtained from a separate sample of 20\nTable 1 Baseline Performance on Test Measures\nTest Measure MS D\nTotal recall (%) 2.92 3.10\nGrasp-to-command (%) 2.50 5.47\nUse-to-command\nAccuracy (%) 0.00 0.00\nCompletion time (seconds) 60.00 0.00\n734 Mem Cogn (2016) 44:727 –739\nyounger adults (8 males, 12 females) between the ages of 18\nand 26 years ( M =2 0 . 6y e a r s ,SD = 2.56 years). As expected,\nparticipants were unable to accurately recall the attributes or\ndemonstrate the skills associated with the tools (see Table 1).\nThus, improved performance in the current study can be at-\ntributed to learning that occurred during the training phase.\nTraining\nCompletion time Figure 2 shows average completion time\nacross training trials (T1, T2, T3) for tools trained under DA\nand FA. Trials in which participants did not complete the task\n(i.e., maximum time scores) were removed before conducting\nanalyses to prevent inflation of scores. Across all trials, 7.2 %\nof trials were removed from the FA condition, and 8.3 % of\ntrials were removed from the DA condition. A one-way with-\nin-subjects ANOV A showed that overall completion time was\nalso slower for tools in the DA condition than in the FA con-\ndition, F(1, 31) = 5.78 , p =. 0 2 2 ,ɳ\n2 =. 1 6 .L i n e a rr e g r e s s i o n\nanalysis was conducted using the slopes of individuals across\nT1, T2, and T3 for tools trained under DA and FA conditions.\nParticipants became significantly faster in using tools in the\nFA condition at a rate of 3.39 s per trial ( SE = .88 s), R2 =. 1 4 ,\nF(1, 94) = 14.87, p < .001, with a y-intercept of 24.02 s ( SE =\n1.90 s). They became significantly faster in using tools in the\nDA condition at a rate of 4.22 s ( SE = 1.11 s) per training trial,\nR\n2 =. 1 3 , F(1, 94) = 14.39, p < .001, with a y-intercept of\n31.10 s ( SE = 2.40 s). The rates of completion time for tools\ntrained under DA ( M =- 4 . 2 2s , SD =3 . 5 1s )a n dF A( M =-\n3.38 s, SD = 3.05 s) did not differ, t(31) = .97, p =. 3 4 ,ɳ2 =. 0 3 .\nIn summary, participants were slower overall in the DA con-\ndition compared to the FA condition; however, the rate of\nlearning was equivalent in the two conditions.\nAs described earlier, the purpose of the probe trial was to\ndistinguish between effects of divided attention on perfor-\nmance versus learning. A paired samples t test on the probe\ntrial completion time showed no difference between tools\ntrained under FA ( M =1 5 . 2 1s ,SD =6 . 4 3s )a n dt o o l st r a i n e d\nunder DA (M =1 6 . 6 8s ,SD =5 . 2 6s ) ,t(31) = -.91 , p =. 3 7 ,ɳ\n2\n= .03. Thus, although dividing attention slowed performance\nin the DA condition in T1, T2, and T3, it did not affect learn-\ning of the motor skills.\nFig. 2 Mean completion time (+/- SE) across training trials (T1, T2, T3,\nand Probe trial) for tools trained under full attention (FA) and divided\nattention (DA)\nFig. 3 Use-to-command accuracy (A) and completion time (B) in the test phase for tools trained under DA and FA.

There was also no main effect of at-\ntention condition on overall error production across trials.\nHowever, there was a main effect of trial, showing that\nparticipants made fewer errors across trials (T1: M =1 . 0 1\nerrors, SD =. 7 1e r r o r s ;T 2 :M =. 6 4e r r o r s ,SD =. 6 6e r r o r s ;\nT3: M =. 6 7e r r o r s ,SD = .69 errors), F(2, 62) = 5.64, p =\n.006, ɳ\n2 = .15. Pairwise comparisons showed that the av-\nerage number of errors was si gnificantly higher in T1 com-\npared to both T2, t(31) = 2.93, p = .006, ɳ2 = .22 and T3,\nt(31) = 3.93, p < .001, ɳ2 = .33. Average number of errors\ndid not differ between T2 and T3. Error analysis for the\nprobe trial, which was conducted in a separate paired-\nsamples t test, showed that the average number of errors\nin the probe trial was significantly higher in the DA con-\ndition ( M =. 7 6e r r o r s ,SD = .80 errors) than in the FA\ncondition ( M = .36 errors, SD = .58 errors), t(31) = -2.22,\np = .034, ɳ2 = .14. In summary, although there was no\nsignificant difference in completion times between the\ntwo attention conditions in the probe trial, participants\nmade more errors in the DA than in the FA condition.\nLag-1 task Ap a i r e d - s a m p l e st test was conducted to compare\npre-training (M =9 8 . 8 9% ,SD = 2.86 %) and posttraining ( M\n=9 7 . 5 6% ,SD = 3.98 %) accuracy on the lag-1 task. Accuracy\ndid not differ between these two time points, t(31) = 1.92, p =\n.07, ɳ\n2 = .11. A paired –samples t test was also conducted to\ncompare the average lag-1 percent accuracy performed during\nDA (i.e., T1, T2, and T3; M =7 3 . 5 0% , SD = 11.49 %) and\nduring FA (i.e., pre- and posttests; M = 98.23 %, SD =\n2.85 %). Accuracy on the lag-1 task was significantly lower\nduring DA than during FA, t(31) = 13. 04, p <. 0 0 1 ,ɳ\n2 =. 8 5 .\nLast, a repeated-measures ANOV A showed that lag-1 accura-\ncy improved across lag-1 training trials, F(2, 62) = 7.57, p =\n.001, ɳ\n2 = .20. Thus, dividing attention had a negative impact\non performance of the secondary task, but there was some\nimprovement across trials.\nUse-to-command\nCompletion time As with the training analyses, maximum\ntime scores were removed before conducting analyses on\nuse-to-command completion time. There was no signifi-\ncant difference in use-to-command completion time be-\ntween tools trained under FA and DA, t(31) = -.21, p =\n.83, ɳ\n2 = .001 (see Fig. 3). In summary, although use-to-\ncommand accuracy was worse for tools trained under DA\nrelative to FA, when looking only at correctly performed\nuse-to-command attempts, there is no effect of dividing\nattention on completion time.\nAccuracy Ap a i r e d - s a m p l e st test showed that use-to-\ncommand accuracy was significantly worse for tools trained\nunder DA relative to FA conditions, t(31) = 3.69, p =. 0 0 1 ,ɳ\n2\n= .31 (see Fig. 3).\nRecall accuracy\nA two-way repeated measures ANOV A was conducted with\nattention (FA vs. DA) and recall category (functional associa-\ntive vs. perceptual) as factors and percentage accuracy as the\nDiscussion\nThe current study investigated the contributions of declarative\nand procedural memory in mediating various aspects of tool-\nrelated knowledge and skills. Participants were trained to use a\nset of novel complex tools under full or divided attention and\nwere subsequently tested on their recall for various aspects\nrelated to these tools (e.g., tool attributes, tool grasping, and\ntool use). In general, it was expected that dividing attention\nduring training would be detrimental for any aspects of tool-\nrelated knowledge depend ent on declarative memory.\nComponents of tool-related knowledge and skills that do not\nrely on declarative memory were expected to be unaffected by\ndividing attention during training. Overall, current findings\nobtained with healthy adults provide converging evidence\nfor results of our previous patient studies.\nMotor skill learning\nIt was hypothesized that motor skill learning is primarily\nmediated by procedural memory processes and, therefore,\nwould not be negatively affect ed by dividing attention with\na secondary auditory lag-1 task. Results showed that, aside\nfrom overall slowing, there was no effect of dividing atten-\ntion on rate of motor skill learning across training trials.\nThere was also no difference in completion time between\nDA and FA conditions in the probe trial, when the second-\nary task was removed. These findings are consistent with\nprevious research showing tha t performance, but not learn-\ning, is affected by dividing attention (Frensch et al., 1998;\nalso see Kantak & Winstein, 2012). This result is also con-\nsistent with previous research suggesting that motor skill\nacquisition is primarily mediated by the procedural mem-\nory system and that it does not require declarative memory\nor attentional resources (Gabrieli et al., 1993;R o y&P a r k ,\n2010; Song, Howard, & Howard, 2007). Thus, motor skill\nlearning associated with complex tools does not appear to\nrely on a cooperative interaction of both memory systems.\nHowever, analysis of error patterns does raise the possibil-\nity of a competitive, or inhibitory, role of declarative mem-\nory during procedural motor skill learning. Participants\nmade more errors in the probe trial for tools trained under\nDA compared to FA. It is possible that in the DA condition\nparticipants had adopted a procedural learning strategy\nduring the first three trials bu t then attempted to perform\nthe tasks consciously in the probe trial, drawing on episod-\nic memory of the task. This hypothesis is consistent with\nthe notion of transfer appropriate processing, which pro-\nposes that performance is enhanced to the extent that the\ncognitive processes during encoding match those required\nduring test (Morris, Bransford, & Franks, 1977).\nPrevious studies have shown that introducing a second-\nary task can enhance motor skill learning (Goh et al., 2012;\nRoche et al., 2007). In the current study, although perfor-\nmance was not enhanced by dividing attention, removal of\nthe secondary task in the DA condition was associated with\na higher number of errors than in the FA condition.\nTherefore, current findings suggest that declarative and\nprocedural memory systems may compete during motor\nskill learning, such that decl arative memory and associated\nattentional processes can disrupt enactment of procedural\nskills.\nSkilled tool use\nSkilled tool use was broken down into two components:\naccuracy and completion time. The accuracy measure\nassessed whether or not the task was performed correctly\nwithin the time limit, regardless of how quickly the partic-\nipant performed the task. In contrast, completion time\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nTotal Recall  Functional\nAssociative\nPerceptual\nAccuracy (%)\nFA\nDA\nFig. 4 Percentage of correct responses (+/- SE) for recall of test items for\ntools trained under full attention (FA) and divided attention (DA)\n736 Mem Cogn (2016) 44:727 –739\ndependent variable (see Fig. 4). There was no significant in-\nteraction between attention condition and recall category on\naccuracy. However, there was a main effect of attention con-\ndition showing lower overall recall accuracy for tools trained\nunder DA compared to FA, F(1, 31) = 8.78, p =. 0 0 6 ,ɳ\n2 =. 2 2 .\nThere was also a main effect of recall category showing that\nparticipants had higher recall accuracy for functional associa-\ntive details about tools than perceptual details, F(1, 31) =\n185.34, p <. 0 0 1 ,ɳ2 =. 8 6 .\nGrasp-to-command\nGrasp-to-command accuracy for tools trained in the two atten-\ntion conditions was analyzed using a paired-samples t test.\nGrasp-to-command demonstration was significantly worse\nfor tools trained under DA ( M = 11.46 %, SD =2 1 . 7 7% )t h a n\ntools trained under FA ( M =3 5 . 4 2% ,SD = 31.61 %), t(31) =\n3.47, p =. 0 0 2 ,ɳ2 =. 2 8 .\nassessed how quickly participants were able to perform\ncorrectly completed tasks. It was hypothesized that skilled\ntool use relies on a cooperative interaction of both declar-\native and procedural memory systems. This hypothesis is\nbased on previous studies showing that disruption of either\ndeclarative or procedural memory leads to impaired skilled\ntool use (Roy & Park, 2010;R o ye ta l , 2015). More spe-\ncifically, it has been proposed that declarative memory\nmay be required for encoding of task-related details (e.g.,\nrecipient placement, sequence of steps) required for accu-\nrate tool use, whereas procedural memory mediates motor\nadeptness of tool use (i.e., completion time). Thus, provid-\ned participants are able to accurately recall details of the\ntask from declarative memory, completion times should be\nunaffected by dividing attention. Consistent with these pre-\ndictions, participants showed lower tool use accuracy for\ntools trained under DA compared to FA. In addition, tool\nuse completion time for accurately performed tasks was\nunaffected by dividing attention during training. Thus, cur-\nrent findings provide evidence of a cooperative interaction\nof memory systems in skilled tool use in a healthy popula-\ntion. Taken together with training data, current findings\nsuggest that motor skill acquisition primarily relies on pro-\ncedural memory, and may be disrupted by involvement of\ndeclarative memory, whereas skilled tool use requires in-\nvolvement of both memory systems. Therefore, although\nmotor skill acquisition and skilled tool use essentially in-\nvolve performance of the same task, the role of different\nmemory systems varies across these two aspects of tool-\nrelated skilled action.\nRecall\nIt was predicted that dividing attention during training would\nnegatively affect accuracy on a subsequent memory test of\ntool attributes. Results showed that total recall of tool attri-\nbutes was significantly lower for tools trained under DA ver-\nsus FA. Tool attributes were divided into two categories, func-\ntional associative and perceptual. The same pattern was found\nfor both functional associative (i.e., tool function and recipient\nidentity) and perceptual (i.e., tool color, recipient color, num-\nber of recipients) attributes. The results for recall of functional\nassociative tool attributes under divided attention are particu-\nlarly informative considering that motor skill acquisition was\nunaffected by dividing attention during training. More specif-\nically, these results suggest that motor skill acquisition is not\ndependent on declarative knowledge related to the tool (e.g.,\nfunction of the tool).\nTool grasping\nAs predicted, tool grasping was significantly lower for\ntools trained under DA relative to FA. This finding is\nconsistent with previous res earch showing that grasping a\ntool for the purpose of using it requires declarative memory\nabout the tool ’s use (Creem & Proffitt, 2001; Roy & Park,\n2010). However, grasping accuracy for tools in the FA\ncondition was much lower than expected (only 35 %).\nThis pattern of poor grasping accuracy even in the FA\ncondition suggests that tool grasping has a strong declara-\ntive representation that requ ires extensive repetition.\nLimitations and future directions\nAs noted in the Results, some observations were removed\nfrom analysis of completion time measures (i.e., training,\nuse-to-command). Although we had a theoretical ratio-\nnale for removing this data, specifically to obtain a more\nBpure^ measure of procedural memory, we acknowledge\nthat removal of data may have had an impact on overall\nfindings. Future work could make use of longer time\nlimits of performance trials or provided more training tri-\nals to reduce the amount of missing data. In addition,\nalthough the current study proposes that specific memory\nsystems play a primary role in mediating different aspects\nof tool-related knowledge and skills, it is likely that mul-\ntiple memory systems and cognitive processes are in-\nvolved in the acquisition of t ool-related knowledge and\nskills. For instance, although the current study focuses on\nthe role of procedural memory in mediating skill learning,\nother forms of nondeclarative memory (i.e., perceptual,\ncerebellar) are also likely i n v o l v e di nl e a r n i n go fm o t o r\nskills.\nConclusion\nThe current study, taken together with previous findings, pre-\nsents evidence of a dynamic relationship between declarative\nand procedural memory systems. Results suggest that the con-\ntribution of declarative and procedural memory systems varies\nacross different aspects of tool knowledge and skills.\nFurthermore, although motor skill acquisition and skilled tool\nuse both appear to rely on an interaction of declarative and\nprocedural memory, they rely on different forms of memory\ninteraction (i.e., competitive, cooperative). Thus, the current\nstudy provides new insights into the organization of memory\nwithin the domain of tool use.\nAcknowledgments We would like to express our gratitude to all the\nparticipants who graciously took the time to complete this experiment.\nWe would also like to thank Naveen Gnanabakthan for assistance with\ninitial development of novel tool tasks and interrater scoring.
