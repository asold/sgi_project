Although the \nutility of several variant prioritization tools has been re-\nported, their effectiveness in Japanese patients remains \nlargely unknown.\nMethods We selected 5 free variant prioritization \ntools (PhenIX, hiPHIVE, Phen-Gen, eXtasy-order \nstatistics, and eXtasy-combined max) and assessed \ntheir effectiveness in Japanese patient populations. To \ncompare these tools, we conducted 2 studies: one based \non simulated data of 100 diseases and another based on \nthe exome data of 20 in-house patients with Mendelian \ndisorders. To this end we selected 100 pathogenic vari-\nants from the “Database of Pathogenic Variants (DPV)” \nand created 100 variant call format ( VCF) files that \neach had pathogenic variants based on reference human \ngenome data from the 1000 Genomes Project. The later \n“in-house” study used exome data from 20 Japanese \npatients with Mendelian disorders. In both studies, we \nutilized 1-5 terms of “Human Phenotype Ontology” as \nclinical information.\nResults In our analysis based on simulated disease \ndata, the detection rate of the top 10 causative variants \nwas 91% for hiPHIVE, and 88% for PhenIX, based \non 100 sets of simulated disease VCF data. Also, both \nsoftware packages detected 82% of the top 1 causative \nvariants. When we used data from our in-house patients \ninstead, we found that these two programs (PhenIX \nand hiPHIVE) produced higher detection rates than \nthe other three systems in our study. The detection rate \nof the top 1 causative variant was 71.4% for PhenIX, \n65.0% for hiPHIVE.\nConclusion The rates of detecting causative variants \nin two Exomizer software packages, hiPHIVE and \nPhenIX, were higher than for the other three software \nsystems we analyzed, with respect to Japanese patients.\nKey words computational biology; databases; genetic; \nwhole exome sequencing\nNext-generation sequencing ( NGS) can exhaustively \nanalyze genes in one sequencing process, and this new \ncapability has dramatically altered the fields of genomic \nresearch and medical genetics. In particular, many \nundiagnosed patients have been receiving benefit from \ngenetic diagnoses by exhaustive gene analysis. Our \nprevious study showed the utility of genetic diagnoses \nfor patients with Mendelian disorders using NGS .\n1 \nResearch methods of nationwide large-scale genomic \nstudies, such as Genomics England and the Initiative of \nRare and Undiagnosed Diseases project in Japan, have \nalso been based on NGS technology.\nVariant prioritization plays a central role in the \ngenetic diagnosis of patients with Mendelian disorders \nwhen using NGS techniques, including whole genome \nsequencing and whole exome sequencing (WES). WES \ncan detect some 30,000 more variants compared to \nhuman reference sequences, and approximately 10,000 \nof these represent nonsynonymous amino acid substitu-\ntions, alterations of conserved splice site residues, or \nsmall insertions or deletions.\n2 Therefore, to detect the \ncausative variant among an enormous number of pos -\nsibilities, subsequent prioritization steps are required. \nFor example, to interpret variants, we utilize several \nreference databases and software systems, including a \ncommon variant database, pathogenic variant databases, \nand in-silico prediction tools. Ultimately, detailed \nconsideration by clinicians and bioinformaticians is \nneeded for detecting the causative variant.\n1 In such \nOriginal ArticleYonago Acta Medica 2019;62(3):244–252 doi: 10.33160/yam.2019.09.001\nCorresponding Author: Tetsuya Okazaki, MD\nt-okazaki@tottori-u.ac.jp\nReceived 2019 June 20\nAccepted 2019 July 17\nOnline published 2019 September 13\nAbbreviations: DPV, Database of Pathogenic Variants; HPO, \nhuman phenotype ontology; NGS, next-generation sequencing; \nSNPs, single nucleotide polymorphisms; SNVs, single nucleotide \nvariants; VCF, variant call format; WES, whole exome sequencing\n245\nComparison of variant prioritization tools\n© 2019 Tottori University Medical Press\nvariant prioritization processes, clinical information is \nessential. Specifically, we use gene lists that have been \nmade by clinicians for each specific analysis. Such \nrecords can help select related variants for a given pa -\ntient’s symptoms, but in those cases where the causative \ngene is omitted from such a list, we would not be able \nto detect the causative variant. Identification of disease-\ncausing variants for patients with Mendelian disorders \nis very complicated and easily qualifies as a “needle in a \nhaystack” challenge.\n3\nSeveral phenotype-driven software tools are \nnow available to help select differential diagnoses. 4 \nAdditionally, to rank the candidate variants in the \ncontext of the enormous number of variants that can be \ndetected by NGS, several software systems use both the \npatient’s phenotypic information and the NGS-derived \ngenotypic data.\n5–12 These software packages are also \nable to directly reference a variety of diverse databases \nand ancillary software systems (Table 1). Comparative \nevaluations of these software products using patient \ndata from Western countries has already been pub -\nlished,\n13 and their utility for causative variant detection \nis well described. However, the utility of these variant \ndetection software systems using data from Japanese \npatients’ data is unknown.\n11 The genetic basis of differ-\nences among ethnic groups has been under-investigated. \nHowever, we cannot rule out that differences in indi -\nvidual single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in each ethnic \ngroup can affect genetic testing results.14 Therefore, we \nproceeded to undertake the first effort to evaluate their \ncapabilities with regard to Japanese patients.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nTo our knowledge, 11 software packages have been \nestablished as variant prioritized tools using Human \nPhenotype Ontology (HPO).\n15 In this research, software \nwas selected using the following criteria using exome \nsequencing data and available as downloaded packages. \nWe finally selected five variant prioritization software \npackages PhenIX,\n12 hiPHIVE, 12 Phen-Gen, 10 eXtasy-\norder statistics,8, 16 and eXtasy-combined max.8 These \nproducts, except for the Phen-Gen package, have \nalready been compared in a previous report. 13 To test \nthese software packages, we selected 1–5 HPO  terms \ncorresponding to specific variant call format ( VCF) \nfiles.15 The HPO provides a common lexicon of pheno-\ntypic abnormalities found in human diseases, and has \nbeen utilized in many databases and NGS projects.17 For \nour analyses using PhenIX and hiPHIVE, we settled \non a cut-off of allele frequency at 1%. We ran all the \nsoftware programs in the form we received them via \ndownloads. In this research, we performed two different \nTable 1.

We retained the default parameter settings in \nall the software products. In addition to the comparison \nof variant detection rates across the various software \nproducts, we also compared variant types and detection \nrates. To classify each variant type, we utilized the \nguidelines of the American College of Medical Genetics \nand Genomics and the Association for Molecular \nPathology, which were developed in 2015. In that \nstatement, null variants including nonsense, frameshift \nand splice sites variants, were classified as very strong \npathogenic criteria.\n18\nSimulated disease data analysis\nFor this part of our study, we created 100 VCF  files \nusing reference genome bam data (1000 Genomes \nProject,19 http://www.internationalgenome.org/home). \nIn addition, we randomly selected 100 pathogenic vari-\nants from the “Database of Pathogenic Variants (DPV), \nhttp://dpv.cmg.med.keio.ac.jp/dpv-pub/variants).” This \ndatabase contains germline pathogenic variants in \nJapanese patients with Mendelian disorders. We then \ncreated 100 simulated patient VCF  files using each \npathogenic variant.\nThe HPO of each disease was randomly selected \nusing the “Phenomizer\n15, 20 system (http://compbio.\ncharite.de/phenomizer).” With this tool, we can pick up \ncausative disorders using the HPO . Additionally, the \nHPO terms with regard to each disease are described \non this site. We analyzed data on 100 simulated patients \nwith the five software packages, using each VCF  file \nand between 1 to 5 selected HPO terms.\nIn-house patient data analysis\nIn the second part of this research project, we analyzed \n20 exome samples collected from Japanese patients \nwith Mendelian disorders. All samples were sequenced \nusing the TruSight One sequencing panel (Illumina, San \nDiego, CA). Sequencing and variant detection methods \nhave already been described in our previous research.\n1 \nWe performed WES  using the Ion AmpliSeq TM \nExome RDY kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, \nMA) for undiagnosed patients despite having performed \nTruSightOne sequencing. All causative variants were \nvalidated by Sanger sequencing. Clinical geneticists \nselected 1 to 5 HPO of each patient based upon a review \nof their medical records. Using both the HPO and VCF \ninformation, we evaluated the detection rate of each \nsoftware program. This study was approved by the \nethics committee at Tottori University (dated September \n22, 2014, approval number G152).\nRESULTS\nSimulated disease data analysis\nWe analyzed 100 simulated disease VCF data using the \nfive different software packages (Fig. 2a). The detection \nrates of causative variants revealed that the best two \nsystems at detecting the top ten variants were hiPHIVE \nat 91%, and PhenIX at 88%. In addition, both products \ndetected 82% of the top 1 variant. We also note that \nboth of the eXtasy software packages (eXtasy-order \nstatistics and eXtasy-combined max) have limitations \non their HPO terms available for analysis and that they \ncould not analyze 20 VCF data items. The detection rate \nof the top 10 causative variants in eXtasy-order statistics \nwas 19.0%, and in eXtasy-combined max product was \n21.0%. In addition, the percentage of variants that could \nbe detected as the chief cause was 6.0% in the order sta-\ntistics system and 10.0% in combined max product. In \nPhen-Gen software, the detection rate of the top 5 caus-\native variants was 29%, the top 10 was 33%, and the top \n1 was zero percent. Detailed results from the simulated \ndisease data analysis are presented in Supplementary \nTable S1.\nPhenIX and hiPHIVE could detect a total of 82 \ncausative variants as being the most critical. They also \nproduced higher detection rates than the other three \nsoftware products (Phen-Gen, eXtasy-order statistics \nand eXtasy-combined max), which correctly detected a \ntotal of only 12 variants as being the most critical. We \nconfirmed that the difference in productivity between \nPhenIX or hiPHIVE and the three other products was \nquite statistically significant ( P < 0.001, by Fisher’s \nexact test). Similarly, PhenIX and hiPHIVE detected 87 \ncausative variants as being the first to fifth main factors \nand showed a higher detection rate than the other three \nsystems (Phen-Gen, eXtasy-order statistics and eXtasy-\ncombined max), which only detected 40 variants as \nbeing in the first to fifth factors. We also confirmed the \nsignificance of this difference between the PhenIX or \nhiPHIVE systems and the three other software pack -\nages using the detection rates regarding the top first to \nfifth data (P < 0.001, by Fisher’s exact test).\nSubsequently, we compared the results of PhenIX \nand hiPHIVE against each other. A total of 79 variants \nwere detected as the top causative factors by both prod-\nucts. The hiPHIVE system detected 7 causative variants \nas having a higher priority than did the PhenIX product \n(ID 3, 7, 30, 60, 72, 88, 96), but the PhenIX software \ndetected 6 causative variants as higher priority than did \nthe hiPHIVE product (ID 29, 38, 59, 70, 71, 73).\nIn this simulated disease aspect of our study, the \nanalyzed variants consisted of 51 missense mutation \nvariants (Fig. 2b) and 44 null variants (Fig. 2c). Because \n247\nComparison of variant prioritization tools\n© 2019 Tottori University Medical Press\nfive variants were deleted from the DPV  site, we ex -\ncluded these from our comparison of the detection rates \nand variant types. We found that Exomiser’s two kinds \nof software (PhenIX and hiPHIVE) correctly detected \n80% of the VCF files as the top 1 through 5 for both the \nmissense mutations and null variants. For Phen-Gen, no \nremarkable difference was found in the detection rate \nin distinguishing between these variant types. For the \neXtasy-order statistics package, the “not ranked” detec-\ntion rate was 64% (28/44) of the null variants and only \n11.8% (6/51) for the missense variants. “Not ranked” \nmeans that the software did not remarkably detect any \ncausative variants within the top 1–100. This tendency \nwas also observed in the eXtasy-combined max pro -\ngram, where 64% (28/44) of the null variants and 11.8% \n(6/51) of the missense variants were also not detected.\nIn-house patient data analysis\nWe also analyzed the data from our 20 in-house patients \nwith Mendelian disorders (Fig. 3 ) using each of the \nfive software products. The detection rate of the top \n10 causative variants for the hiPHIVE system was \n85.7%, and for the PhenIX product this was 76.2%. \nAlso, the percentage of variants that could be detected \nas the chief cause was 61.9% in hiPHIVE and 71.4% \nin PhenIX. In our analysis of eXtasy, we found that it \ndiscovered the principal causative variant in only 5% of \nthe cases, and its finding of the top 10 factors was only \n10%. Remarkably, we also found that, for eXtasy, the \ncombined max analysis could not detect any of the main \ncausative variants, nor any within the top 10. Likewise, \nPhen-Gen also generated poor results, identifying zero \nof the top five causative variants, only 5% of the top 10, \nand zero of the chief causes. Detailed results of variant \ndata analysis are described in Supplementary Table S2.\nPhenIX could detect 15 of the top causative vari -\nants and showed a higher detection rate than the other \nthree software products (Phen-Gen, order statistics, and \ncombined max eXtasy), each of which only detected one \ntop variant. We confirmed the significance of the differ-\nences between PhenIX and these three other software \nproducts (P < 0.001, by Fisher’s exact test).\nFig. 1. Overview of the prioritization software comparison study.\nTwo separate investigations were performed, one using data from in-house patients, and the other based on simulated data. We compared \n5 different software products (PhenIX, hiPHIVE, Phen-Gen, eXtasy-order statistics and eXtasy-combined max). These systems use \nvariant call format (VCF) files and the human phenotype ontology (HPO). In simulated disease analyses, we created 100 virtual patient \nVCF files, and added pathogenic variants based on reference to the VCF files in the 1000 Genome Project. We selected 100 pathogenic \nvariants from the Japanese pathogenic variant database (http://dpv.cmg.med.keio.ac.jp/dpv-pub/variants). Additionally, we selected sev-\neral HPO files for each VCF from the Phenomizer site (http://compbio.charite.de/phenomizer). For the in-house patient analysis, we used \nVCF files and HPO for specific patients with Mendelian disorders.\n\n248\nM. Ebiki et al.\n© 2019 Tottori University Medical Press\nFig. 2.

Ebiki et al.\n© 2019 Tottori University Medical Press\nSimilarly, PhenIX detected 15 of the top 1–5 \ncausative variants and in this regard also showed a \nhigher detection rate than the other three software \nsystems (Phen-Gen, order statistics, and combined max \neXtasy), which only detected two variants, respectively. \nWe again confirmed this statistical difference between \nPhenIX and three software (P < 0.001, by Fisher’s exact \ntest).\nIn a similar pattern, hiPHIVE could detect 13 \ncausative variants as being the top 1, and 17 variants \nas being in the top 1–5. This software also produced \na higher detection rate than the three other software \nsystems (Phen-Gen, order statistics, and combined max \neXtasy), which detected only one variant as a top 1 \nand 2 variants as being among the top 1–5 causes. We \nlikewise confirmed this difference in top 1 and top 1–5 \ndetection rates between hiPHIVE and three software \nas being statistically significant (P < 0.001, by Fisher’s \nexact test).\nWe subsequently compared the results produced by \nthe PhenIX and hiPHIVE systems against each other \nand found that the same 13 variants were detected as the \ntop causes by both products. For three causative variants \n(patients 1, 16, 19), hiPHIVE identified them as having \na higher priority than did PhenIX. In contrast, PhenIX \ndetected two causative variants as having a higher prior-\nity than hiPHIVE (patients 6, 10).\nOver the course of this in-house study, we analyzed \n11 missense mutation variants (Fig. 3b) and 8 null vari-\nants (Fig. 3c). Because patient 3’s variant types were \nmissense mutation and null variant, we excluded the \ncase from our comparison of the detection rates and \nvariant types. With the Phen-Gen product, we found \nno remarkable difference in the detection rate despite \nthe distinction of the variant types. In Exomiser’s two \ntypes of software (PhenIX and hiPHIVE), the detection \nrate of causative variants within the top 10 was 100% \nin the analysis of the null variants, and also quite high \nfor the missense variants: PhenIX at 72.7% (8/11) and \nhiPHIVE at 81.8% (9/11). In addition, the detection rates \nof “not ranked” for both software were 18.2% (2/11) in \nthe missense variants analysis. With the two eXtasy \nsoftware products (order statistics and combined max) \nthe proportion of “not ranked” results was 25% (2/8) for \nthe null variants data and 27% (3/11) for the missense \nvariants.\nDISCUSSION\nOur simulated disease data analysis indicated that the \ndetection rates with PhenIX and hiPHIVE were sub -\nstantially higher than those with the remaining 3 tools; \nthis trend was corroborated by the previously reported \nresults.\n13 However, the utility of these two software \npackages, specifically regarding Japanese patients, had \npreviously been unknown. Our present research indeed \nshowed that the two software systems generated high \ndetection rates when using simulated Japanese patient \ndata and also when using the data from our in-house \npatients. We provide detailed information available to \nus regarding each software product in Table 1, but only \nlooking at this information, we do not understand why \nthere is such a substantial difference in the detection \nrates across the various products. Software update \nfrequency might be one of the most important factors \nin improving detection rates. In fact, frequent updates \nare done for Exomiser. For example, integration of a \nusable database and adding the most recent algorithms \nare done continuously.\n17 The detection rate of the top 10 \ncausative variants in hiPHIVE was 20.0% in the previ-\nous report,13 whereas the present research detection rate \nof this software was 90.0%. Certain mechanisms are \nunknown, but frequent software updates in Exomizer \nmight be one of the key elements of improving the \nidentification rate.\nThe detection rate of the causative variants \nfor hiPHIVE and PhenIX was higher than for the \nother software except for the data related to ID 71 \n(Supplementary Table S1). In this case, with c.755G > C, \nand p Arg252Pro in the PAH gene, we found that Phen-\nGen and eXtasy-order statistics detected the causative \nvariant as in the top 3, while eXtasy-combined max \ndetected it among the top 7. In contrast, hiPHIVE \nrecognized it as being among the top 10, and PhenIX \nidentified it as among the top 14.\nSimilarly, other variants of the PAH  gene in ID \n70 and 72 also had relatively low detection results in \nhiPHIVE and PhenIX. In comparison, the detection \nrate of ID 73 in the PAH gene for hiPHIVE and PhenIX \nwas higher than in the two eXtasy software programs. \nAlso, Phen-Gen could detect more than could the two \neXtasy products. We considered many possible reasons \nfor this particular result regarding the PAH  gene, but \nwe could not reach a conclusion about the mechanism \ninvolved due to a lack of more detailed information \nabout each software product and the methods they use. \nNonetheless, this result suggests that the detection rates \ncan differ depending on the gene.\nAssociations between the detection rate and the \nvariant type were not found for hiPHIVE, PhenIX, and \nPhen-Gen products, except for the eXtasy software \nsystems. Notably, in the two types of eXtasy software, \nusable HPOs were limited, and we could not analyze \n20/100 (20%) of the VCF  files. Although statistical \nanalysis could not be performed because of our small \n251\nComparison of variant prioritization tools\n© 2019 Tottori University Medical Press\nsample size, this result suggests that the detection rate \nof the 2 eXtasy software products might be inadequate \nwith regard to the analysis of null variants.\nIn this simulated study, we created VCF  files to \nsimulate patient genomic data. The 100 bam data files \nregistered in the 1000 Genome Project were randomly \nselected in this study. These bam data files contain not \nonly Japanese data files but also non-Japanese data \nfiles, and we cannot deny that specific SNVs  related \nto non-Japanese data affected the analysis results. In \nour subsequent analyses using this simulated data, we \nobtained results similar to what we found using data \nfrom actual in-house patients. As a result, we speculate \nthat this approach of using simulated patient data might \nindeed be more broadly useful for the comparisons of \nother variant prioritization tools.\nFrom in-house patient data analysis results involv-\ning ranked comparisons, it is clear that the causative \nvariant detection rate of hiPHIVE and PhenIX was \nhigher than that of the other software products. We \nparticularly note that hiPHIVE was able to detect all \nthe causative variants within the top 10 except for \nonly the two ECHS1 items. Indeed, these two ECHS1  \ngene variants from patients 7 and 12 were missed by \nall five software products. The ECHS1  gene was not \nincluded in our TruSight One sequencing panel, and \nwe only detected these variants in the ECHS1  gene \nusing WES. We suggest that since the mitochondrial \nshort-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase 1 deficiency due to \nECHS1 m u ta ti o ns  w as  firs t  repo rted  o nl y  in  2 0 1 4 ,\n21 it \nis possible that the software packages we examined \nmight be unable to readily detect such relatively new \ndisorders (Fig. 3). All five software products use the \nPhenomizer program described in Table 1 of this paper, \nand we hypothesize that this relatively new gene was \nnot listed in it. However, since these software packages \nand their related databases are updated daily, we have to \nassume that Phenomizer was updated at the time of our \nanalyses.\nSeveral variants cause specific phenotypes in \nMendelian disorders. N540K in the FGFR3  of hy -\npochondroplasia and S2G in the SHOC2  of Noonan-\nlike syndrome with loose anagen hair are well-known \nvariants related to specific phenotypes among clinical \ngeneticists. We found that hiPHIVE and PhenIX could \ndetect these variants, but the other software products re-\nmarkably could not. This failure is noteworthy because \nwe would expect that purpose-built causative variant \nprioritization tools should be easily able to detect these \nwell-known variants.\nExomiser, including its use in hiPHIVE and \nPhenIX, recently received the approval of the \nInternational Rare Diseases Research Consortium as \na recognized resource.\n17 Overall, the detection rates of \ncausative variants with hiPHIVE and PhenIX was high-\ner than with the other software products in our study. \nThis result is the same found in previous research.\n13\nAs a technical note, we should mention that \nalthough one can find many diagnostic software tools \nonline using HPO and VCF files,\n11 in our present study, \nthis would have required uploading sensitive patient \ndata. Therefore, to fully adhere to the protection of per-\nsonal information, in this present research, we operated \nall five software as downloaded packages.\nHPO provides a comprehensive bioinformatic \nresource for the analysis of human diseases and pheno-\ntypes.\n15 It has therefore been adopted as the standard for \nphenotypic terms in international rare affected tissues, \nregistries, clinical laboratories, biomedical resources, \nand clinical software tools.\n17, 22–27 The description of \nphenotypic variations has become critical for genomic \nmedicine and translational research,\n28–31 and our having \n“computable” descriptions of human diseases using \nHPO phenotypic profiles is a key element in the use of \nPhenotype-based exome analysis tools. Further studies \nof HPO setting methodologies for these tools are needed \nto enable us to detect causative variants more efficiently.\nIn conclusion, we confirmed the utility of causative \nvariant prioritization tools with regard to Japanese \npatients. In particular, the detection rate of causative \nvariants in two Exomizer software products, hiPHIVE \nand PhenIX, was higher than in that of the three other \nsystems we analyzed.\nAcknowledgments: I would like to thank M.Shimada, Y.Endo, \nH.Sunada, A.Koga, K.Uehara and M.Ueki at Advanced \nMedicine of Innovation and Clinical Research Center of Tottori \nUniversity Hospital for their support.
