  "abstract": "Under the condition of Baader aging, the chemical composition variation and the influence of transformer oil aging on electrical properties such as dielectric loss factor and physic-chemical properties such as interfacial tension were studied in the aging precess. Moreover, the correlation between hydrogenated transformer oil electrical and physic-chemical properties and its chemical composition variation were also investigated. The results show that these parameters of physic-chemical and electrical properties of hydrogenated transformer oil relate to each other and have closed correlation with chemical composition.",
