    "abstract": "Effective diagnosis of vibration fault is of practical significance to ensure the safe and stable operation of power transformers. Aiming at the traditional problems of transformer vibration fault diagnosis, a novel feature extraction method based on complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) and multi-scale dispersion entropy (MDE) was proposed. In this paper, CEEMDAN method is used to decompose the original transformer vibration signal. Additionally, then MDE is used to capture multi-scale fault features in the decomposed intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Next, the principal component analysis (PCA) method is employed to reduce the feature dimension and extract the effective information in vibration signals. Finally, the simplified features are sent into density peak clustering (DPC) to get the fault diagnosis results. The experimental data analysis shows that CEEMDAN-MDE can effectively extract the information of the original vibration signals and DPC can accurately diagnose the types of transformer faults. By comparing different algorithms, the practicability and superiority of this proposed method are verified.",
