  "abstract": "The use of electrical energy has important place in modern society. In this regard, the studies were carried out on transformer which is one of the most important parts in transmission and distribution of the electric power. As a result of these studies, a new type of transformer based on power electronics has emerged. These new transformers are named as power electronic transformer (PET) or solid state transformer (SST). Interest in the electronic power transformer which used in many applications is increasing day by day. So, many researchers have focused on the control and design of these transformers. In this study, control strategy has been proposed for fuzzy logic controller (FLC) based PET system. Proposed PET system consists of input, isolation and output stages. In order to test dynamic performance of FLC based PET system, simulation study was carried out by MATLAB/Simulink. The results obtained from the FLC based PET are not only superior in the rise time, settling time and overshoot but can prevent from voltage sag-swell and has improved power quality.",
