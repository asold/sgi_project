Introduction\nConsider the following two messages: “Every woman needs #folicacid every day, but even\nmore women need it in their ﬁrst trimester! Folic acid is an essential nutrient needed for the\nformation of new blood cells in the womb, as well as the developing nervous system, ” and “The\nrisk of neural tube defects is reduced if women consume 400 micrograms of #folate every day\nbefore and during early pregnancy. ” Could you tell which of these messages was written by\nan AI system? We will resolve this question at the end of this paper, which will discuss the\ntheoretical potential, practical, and ethical implications of AI for communication science,\nhere focusing ﬁrst on the generation of health awareness messages.\n/one.tnum\n/one.tnum Importantly, we anticipate that the scope and impact of AI in communication will go far beyond health\nawareness messaging, including AI-based health persuasion (f ocusing on attitude and behavior change),\nAI in political communication, advertising, as well as interper sonal domains. However, this paper focuses\nexclusively on the generation of brief messages intended to rais e awareness; we view this as a high-impact\nand decidedly pro-social domain in which communication and AI can connect. Throughout the paper, we\nwill emphasize that at this stage, inﬂuencing attitudes and b ehavior via AI-generated messaging systems\nis a possibility (and likely already ongoing), but this empirical research paper focuses only on the proximal\ngoal of raising awareness.\nFrontiers in Communication /zero.tnum/one.tnum frontiersin.org\nLim and Schmälzle /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fcomm./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum./one.tnum/one.tnum/two.tnum/nine.tnum/zero.tnum/eight.tnum/two.tnum\nIn this paper, we ﬁrst introduce the theoretical underpinnings\nof AI-based message generation. The following section explains\nthe application context, health communication, and speciﬁcally\nhealth awareness campaigns on social network sites. The third\nsection brings these two research streams together, discussing how\nAI language models can generate health awareness messages and\nintroducing recent research in this area. We then present a series\nof studies with the hypotheses and research questions. Finally, we\ndiscuss the results and their implications.\n/one.tnum./one.tnum. AI message generation: theory,\nmethod, and relevance for communication\nTheoretical breakthroughs in deep learning (DL), most of\nwhich happened between 2010 and 2020, have equipped computers\nwith impressive capacities. Deep learning uses artiﬁcial neural\nnetworks that are stacked across multiple layers (hence: deep) and\nare trained to perform speciﬁc tasks (hence: learning). The tasks\ninclude automatic speech recognition (e.g., for voice dictation)\nand image recognition (e.g., labeling objects in photographs). DL-\nfueled applications are integrated in every cell phone and computer\n(\nSchmidhuber, 2015 ; Hassabis et al., 2017 ; Chollet, 2021 ). While\nthese capacities were initially geared more toward perceptual and\nreceptive tasks like speech and image recognition, the ﬁeld soon\nexpanded to include generative, productive tasks, such as text or\nimage synthesis. For example, every text processing software now\nincludes the ability to auto-complete words from their beginning\nor even suggest entire sentence continuations.\nTo provide readers with a non-technical intuition of the\nunderlying principles, we ask you to consider the sentence “I take\nmy coﬀee with cream and . . . .” Most people will predict the next\nword as “sugar.” Logically, given the semantic context set up by\nthe preceding words, the word sugar is very likely—certainly far\nmore likely than e.g., “socks.” Language models (LMs) used for\nnatural language processing (NLP) are powered by artiﬁcial neural\nnetworks trained to complete next-word prediction tasks like the\nexample above. During the training process, large amounts of texts\nare gathered and fed into the neural networks, and the neural\nnetworks repetitively perform next-word-prediction by computing\nconditional probabilities that a word will come after another word\n(or sets of words). Once this training process is complete, the model\nwill have learned the hidden statistical relationships between words\nin a large corpus of natural language (\nHirschberg and Manning,\n2015). When prompted with a text like “I take my coﬀee with cream\nand . . . , ” then for every word processed during the training process,\nthe neural network will be able to calculate the probability that the\nword will come after the text. If trained well, the language model\nwill assign the word “sugar” with the greatest likelihood of being\nthe next word. This principle can be applied over multiple scales,\nfrom letters in words (like when a word starts with “th” it is likely\nthat the next letter will be an “e”) to words in sentences (like in the\nexample above), and beyond.\nA subﬁeld of DL called generative deep learning (generative DL;\nGoodfellow et al., 2016 ; Chollet, 2021), takes this idea of next-word\nprediction to the next level by using pre-trained language models\nfor text generation (\nGatt and Krahmer, 2018 ; Keskar et al., 2019 ;\nTunstall et al., 2022 ). The texting apps and email programs that\ncan suggest next-word candidates or autocompletion options for\nsentences are powered by such language models. One can enter\na sequence of words in the system, and the LM will compute\nconditional probabilities of the next word, so that the texting or\nthe email system will select the word with the highest probability\nto either recommend to the user or to autocomplete the text.\nRecent advancements in generative DL have led to so-called large\nlanguage models (LLMs) that can move beyond simple next-word-\nprediction tasks to generate complex content that appears natural\nto humans (\nRashkin et al., 2020 ; Tunstall et al., 2022 ; Bubeck\net al., 2023 ; Liu et al., 2023 ). Examples of these highly proﬁcient\ntext generation systems include OpenAI’s ChatGPT, along many\nothers (e.g., Google’s BARD and Huggingface’s Bloom). Although\nmany limitations still exist (\nBender and Koller, 2020 ), recent\nadvancements in this area are very relevant for communication\nscience and have many theoretical implications.\nFirst, LLMs’ capability to generate messages\n/two.tnumthat closely\nmimic human natural language provides new opportunities\nfor communication scientists to study principles of message\ngeneration. Message generation, as conceived here, consists of\ndeveloping the prompts to feed to the LLM (similar to message\nproduction;\nGreene, 2013 ) and adjusting the statistical parameters\nof the LLM (mimicking the process of language production via\nthe human neural system). Indeed, although we can rely on\nmany principles and theories for communication message design\n(\nMiller et al., 1977 ; Witte et al., 2001 ; Cho, 2011 ), the act of\ncoming up with a novel and grammatically correct message in\nnatural language is still a largely creative endeavor (\nGelernter,\n2010) that humans accomplish via intuition ( Hodgkinson et al.,\n2008). As such, we must acknowledge that there is a gap in\nour understanding of how humans naturally come up with new\nmessages.\n/three.tnumHowever, with LLMs, which are created to mimic\nnatural human language, researchers can get a glimpse into the\n/two.tnum We acknowledge that deﬁnitions of communication, message, and\ntheory can vary, and there are many longstanding debates about wh at\ncounts and what does not count as communication, message, or theory.\nClearly, the ﬁeld of NLP is closer to engineering and computer sc ience and\nhas to a large degree ignored communication science (e.g.,\nBender and\nKoller, /two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/zero.tnum). Nevertheless, there have always been theoretical connecti ons,\nlike between computer-mediated communication and voice assist ants, or\nusing computational methods to analyze communication. The adven t of\ntext generation methods—although they still certainly lack many if not the\nmost central characteristics of human communication (e.g., int ent, goals,\npragmatics, etc.)—is clearly bringing the ﬁelds into closer con tact. As such, we\nbelieve that it will be in communication scientists’ best inte rest to engage with\nthis development, which is already inﬂuencing key aspects of communication\nin the /two.tnum/one.tnumst century.\n/three.tnum To be clear, one could certainly view the entire literature on rhetoric\nas being focused on message production and delivery, like the notion\nof ‘inventio’ in Aristotle’s theory, which can be considered the b irthplace\nof communication science. Likewise, work on communication goals\nand strategic communication also have action- or production-orient ed\nelements. However, these approaches are geared toward more abstr act\nlevels, and they are all silent about the actual nuts and bolts o f message\ngeneration.\nFrontiers in\nCommunication /zero.tnum/two.tnum frontiersin.org\nLim and Schmälzle /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fcomm./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum./one.tnum/one.tnum/two.tnum/nine.tnum/zero.tnum/eight.tnum/two.tnum\nmessage generation process and are increasingly able to strategically\nsteer this process via prompt engineering and related approaches\n(\nvon Werra et al., 2020 ). Demonstrating this potential of human-\naided prompt engineering in combination with LLM’s capability for\nmessage generation is one of the key goals of this paper.\nA second argument as to why AI-based message generation\nresearch is theoretically relevant is because theory and method\nevolve in a synergistic relationship (\nGreenwald, 2012). In particular,\ntechnological advances often promote new theory and stimulate\ntheoretical advances, which then provide the basis for new\nmethods. Applying this to the current context, we expect that\nthe abilities to generate messages (see the paragraphs above) hold\npromise to expand our theoretical understanding of what has\nso far remained enigmatic, namely how new, coherent messages\ncan be created. Within health communication, we have already\nseen how computational methods have been used to test and\nexpand existing theories (\nChen et al., 2020 ; Rains, 2020 ; Lee et al.,\n2023). In this sense, putting method and theory in opposition\nis—although common—actually misleading. /four.tnumInstead, we expect\nthat the nexus between AI, message communication, and message\nreception research will lead to synergistic beneﬁts between theory\nand method.\nThird, as methods promote theory and vice versa, we often\nsee the emergence of entirely new ﬁelds of research. For instance,\nwhen computers came into contact with communication, the\nﬁeld of CMC arose, which in turn stipulated theory. As AI\nemerged into communication research, especially within the ﬁeld\nof CMC, AI-mediated communication arose as a ﬁeld (\nHancock\net al., 2020 ). Similarly, theory and methods from communication\nand neuroscience are converging, giving rise to the ﬁeld of\ncommunication neuroscience (\nHuskey et al., 2020 ; Schmälzle and\nMeshi, 2020 ). Together, these three arguments underscore why\nthe nexus of AI and communication is a theoretical wellspring: 3\nDL-approaches for text generation help explain a henceforth\nmystic process and they provide us with a principled approach to\ngenerate thousands of novel messages, which we can analyze. This\ndevelopment has started to impact many ﬁelds of communication,\nincluding health communication.\nFinally, LLMs’ capability of generating hundreds of messages\nwithin a short period of time also provides new opportunities\nfor communication researchers to test existing theories regarding\nmessage processing and eﬀects. Within communication, a plethora\nof research regarding message eﬀects (e.g., emotional appeals;\nNabi\net al., 2020 ; Turner and Rains, 2021 , message tailoring; Noar\net al., 2007 ), information processing (e.g, Elaboration Likelihood\nModel; Petty et al., 1986 ), and persuasion (e.g., source factors;\nO’Keefe, 2015, social norms; Lapinski and Rimal, 2005 ) exist. Thus,\nresearchers can adjust the prompt texts according to formative\nresearch and/or existing theories to generate speciﬁc types of\n/four.tnum Paraphrasing Lewin, who once said that “There’s nothing so practical as\na good theory” (/one.tnum/nine.tnum/four.tnum/three.tnum),Greenwald (/two.tnum/zero.tnum/one.tnum/two.tnum) states that “There is nothing so\ntheoretical as a good method.” History clearly supports both stateme nts,\nlike when the development of telescopes massively propelled as tronomical\ntheories, or the cross-pollination of neuroscience and mathemati cal theories\nin the /one.tnum/nine.tnum/four.tnum/zero.tnums, which paved the way for the deep learning revolution in the last\ndecade.\nmessages, and then use computational and human evaluation\nmethods to test the theories. There is already evidence of\nresearchers leveraging LLMs for persuasive message generation\nwithin health communication (\nKarinshak et al., 2023 ; Zhou et al.,\n2023). While we do not test speciﬁc existing message eﬀects theories\nin this paper, we address the feasibility of using these machines\nto generate social media health messages. We turn to this in the\nnext section.\n/one.tnum./two.tnum. Health communication, awareness\ncampaigns, and the message generation\nbottleneck\nThe need to communicate about health is clear, compelling,\nand constantly high: About 60% of worldwide deaths and a large\nshare of the global burden of disease are due to preventable\nfactors (\nMokdad et al., 2004 ; Giles, 2011 ; Ahmad and Anderson,\n2021). By using health communication to inform and inﬂuence\nindividuals, we hope to be able to reduce these numbers and help\npeople to live healthier and happier lives (\nSchmälzle et al., 2017 ).\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has made this all particularly salient,\nalthough there are many other topics beyond infectious disease\nand vaccinations where health communication comes into play\n(e.g., general health promotion and disease prevention, nutrition\nand lifestyle, substance use, risk behaviors, etc.;\nThompson and\nHarrington, 2021).\nHealth communication research is complex and multifaceted,\nso this section will only focus on the topic of health-related\nmass media campaigns (\nAtkin and Silk, 2008 ; Rice and Atkin,\n2012). Even within this more conﬁned area, we will only focus on\nawareness messaging. Health awareness campaigns are aimed at\nincreasing the public’s knowledge about a particular health issue\nand ways to prevent it. Though much of health communication\nresearch examines attitude and behavioral change, increasing the\npublic’s knowledge about the health issue sets the foundation of\nany health campaign.\n/five.tnumOne must know about the health problem\nto have an attitude or act upon it. Existing literature provides\nexamples of awareness inﬂuencing attitudes and behavior (e.g.,\nYang and Mackert, 2021 ). In addition, simply increasing public\nknowledge about a health issue can help alleviate the extent of the\nproblem. Thus, campaigns’ focus can also be to engage the public\nand increase knowledge (\nBettinghaus, 1986).\nMass communication channels, particularly social media\nplatforms, provide cost-eﬀective tools to spread awareness about\n/five.tnum Please note that the goal of this study focuses only on generating\nmessages that are capable of raising awareness about health is sues. Clearly,\nadditional goals of health communication and persuasion, particu larly\nattitude and potentially even behavior change, are within the r ealm of\npossibilities, but these are not the goal of this study. To our knowle dge, these\ngoals have not yet been addressed by research and we deliberatel y chose to\nfocus on the arguably simpler goal of raising awareness and dealin g with the\ncomplexities of attitudes and behavior at a later point. That sa id, however,\nawareness about a health issue is the most obvious and important st arting\npoint because people cannot prevent risks of whose existence the y are not\naware (\nBettinghaus, /one.tnum/nine.tnum/eight.tnum/six.tnum; McGuire, /two.tnum/zero.tnum/zero.tnum/one.tnum; Schmälzle et al., /two.tnum/zero.tnum/one.tnum/seven.tnum).\nFrontiers in Communication /zero.tnum/three.tnum frontiersin.org\nLim and Schmälzle /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fcomm./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum./one.tnum/one.tnum/two.tnum/nine.tnum/zero.tnum/eight.tnum/two.tnum\nhealth issues to large audiences ( Shi et al., 2018 ; Willoughby and\nNoar, 2022 ). On social media, people can connect with others and\nhave social networks that extend beyond geographical boundaries.\nUsers can share information and pass it on to another through\ntheir social networks. Social networks, then, allow information\nto be disseminated to a large number of people at a rapid pace.\nExisting literature has shown that social media can be eﬀectively\nused to raise awareness on health prevention issues such as Covid\n(\nChan et al., 2020 ), skin cancer ( Gough et al., 2017 ), or the famous\nALS ice-water bucket challenge ( Wicks, 2014 ; Shi et al., 2018 ). In\naddition, the true power of social media is when content becomes\n“viral, ” achieving a signiﬁcantly high amount of awareness (e.g.,\nALS ice-water bucket challenge). Health researchers have already\nbegun examining how to leverage this phenomenon on social\nmedia to expand the research of health messages (\nThackeray et al.,\n2008; Kim, 2015 ; Wang et al., 2019 ). Thus, if leveraged well,\ncommunicators can potentially reach billions of people from all\nover the world through awareness campaigns.\nOn the other hand, the rapid advancements in social media\nhave created additional challenges for health professionals (\nShi\net al., 2018 ; Willoughby and Noar, 2022 ). For one, each social\nmedia platform has diﬀerent characteristics of predominant users,\nmaking it a challenge to truly understand what types of people the\ncampaigns will reach on the platforms. Second, features that make\ncontent viral on social media platforms constantly change. This\ndynamic nature of social media presents a signiﬁcant challenge for\nhealth researchers. While large companies may have the ﬁnancial\nresources to hire prominent inﬂuencers, health campaigners often\nlack these resources. In addition, crafting health messages often\ntakes time and resources to conduct formative research, create\nmessages, and then pretest the messages (\nSnyder, 2007 ; Rice and\nAtkin, 2012 ). By the time messages are created, the content may\nno longer be interesting enough to the audience. Thus, generating\nand disseminating quality health content fast enough to match the\nspeed of developments in social media has become a challenging\ntask for campaigners. A message generation system that can\ngenerate awareness messages within a few minutes, then, can help\nreduce the bottleneck of message creation.\n/one.tnum./three.tnum. Promoting folic acid awareness as a\ntest case for AI health message generation\nThis study will use folic acid (FA) as a test case to examine\nwhether a state-of-the-art AI system is capable of generating health\nmessages to promote awareness about this important topic. Folic\nacid, or folate, is a type of vitamin B9 that is essential for new cell\ngeneration and building DNA [\nGeisel, 2003 ; Folate (Folic Acid),\n2012; CDC, 2022 ]. While it is suggested that folic acid may help\nprevent health issues in adults (e.g., stroke; Wang et al., 2007 ),\nit is most known to prevent birth defects such as neural tube\ndefects (NTDs) in newborn babies (\nScholl and Johnson, 2000 ; CDC,\n2022). NTDs refer to defects in the spinal cord, brain, and areas\naround them, and they are part of the ﬁve most serious birth\ndefects in the world (\nGithuku et al., 2014 ). This defect is especially\ndangerous because it could form in the fetus during the early\nstages of pregnancy, sometimes even before the mother is aware of\nthe pregnancy. To prevent NTDs, CDC recommends that women\nconsume at least 400 mcg of folic acid a day, especially during the\nearly stages of pregnancy (\nGomes et al., 2016 ; CDC, 2022 ). Despite\nthe signiﬁcance of consuming folic acid, there is a general lack of\nawareness regarding this issue. Spreading awareness about the issue\ncan therefore help decrease the rate of birth defects (\nGreen-Raleigh\net al., 2006 ; Medawar et al., 2019 ).\nExtant folic acid awareness campaigns showed some\neﬀectiveness in increasing knowledge about folic acid. For\nexample, a review by\nRofail et al. (2012) showed that existing folic\nacid campaigns increased knowledge of sources of folic acid. Other\nextant literature showed that folic acid awareness campaigns not\nonly increased knowledge but also promoted an increase in folic\nacid consumption (\nAmitai et al., 2004 ). Taken together, folic acid\nremains an important health topic that suﬀers from a chronic lack\nof awareness because too few women of childbearing age are aware\nof the link between folic acid and NTDs during early pregnancy\n(\nMedawar et al., 2019 ). Thus, folic acid is an ideal health issue to\ntest the value of an AI-message engine.\n/one.tnum./four.tnum. Using AI to generate health awareness\nmessages\nIn this section, we will shift back to AI-based message\ngeneration and review how newly available text-generation\ntechnologies have already been applied to health communication\nin very few prior studies. To our knowledge, only one paper in\ncommunication has used NLP models to generate health awareness\nmessages.\nSchmälzle and Wilcox (2022) introduced a message\nmachine capable of creating new awareness messages. Speciﬁcally,\nthey used a GPT2-LM to generate short topical text messages, now\ncommonly called tweets. This was done because twitter is one of\nthe most prominent social media sites, and speciﬁcally text-focused.\nMoreover, twitter is used heavily for health promotion, although\nthe messages that were generated could also be posted elsewhere,\nespecially on Facebook or Instagram. In order to generate topic-\nfocused (i.e. about Folic Acid) social media messages,\nSchmälzle\nand Wilcox (2022) used a ﬁne-tuning strategy. Fine-tuning refers\nto retraining a language model with a dataset so the model can\ngenerate messages with similar structure and content as the dataset\n(one can think of it as expert training in a speciﬁc domain).\nSpeciﬁcally, they ﬁne-tuned a GPT-2 based model on messages\nabout folic acid and then used it to generate novel messages about\nthis topic. They compared AI-generated messages against human\nmessages and found that AI-generated messages were on par, and\neven minimally higher compared to the human-generated messages\nin terms of quality and clarity.\nA second paper used NLP to generate persuasive messages\nin the context of Covid-19 vaccination.\nKarinshak et al. (2023)\nused GPT-3, a successor model of GPT-2, to generate messages\nto encourage getting the Covid-19 vaccine. One of the features\nof GPT3 is that it enables so-called zero-shot learning, that is\ngenerating messages from prompts without prior ﬁne-tuning. The\nresults showed that participants rated AI-generated messages as\nmore eﬀective, having better arguments, and they aﬀected post-\nexposure attitudes more strongly.\nFrontiers in Communication /zero.tnum/four.tnum frontiersin.org\nLim and Schmälzle /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fcomm./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum./one.tnum/one.tnum/two.tnum/nine.tnum/zero.tnum/eight.tnum/two.tnum\nTogether, these studies suggest that AI message generation is\nfeasible and promising for health communication. However, with\nonly two published studies that we are aware of, it is clear that many\nquestions remain unanswered, perhaps even unasked, and that the\nrapid pace at which AI systems evolve require further research.\n/one.tnum./five.tnum. The current study and hypotheses\nThe current study tested people’s perceptions of AI-generated\nvs. human-generated messages in terms of quality and clarity.\nCompared to prior work, this study implemented several\nkey innovations: a newer and more powerful LLM named\nBloom, a novel message generation strategy (prompting), and a\nmore challenging comparison standard (comparing AI-generated\nmessages to the most shared messages).\nThis study used the Bloom model, the most recent and largest\nopen-source LLM available to researchers (\nScao et al., 2022 ). In\naddition to being openly available, Bloom allows for prompting,\nwhich refers to inputting the beginning part of a text (e.g., “A good\nnight’s sleep is important because . . . ” ). Then the machine provides\nthe text output that begins with the prompt (e.g., “A good night’s\nsleep is important because your body needs to recover ”). Simply put,\nthe prompting technology provides a context, thereby constraining\nthe topic of the generated text to the situation provided in the\nprompt. Studying the mechanisms and eﬀects of prompting is\ncurrently an active topic, known as prompt engineering, which\nholds much potential for communication scientists (\nLin and Riedl,\n2021; Liu et al., 2023 ).\nThis study also improved the process for selecting human-\ngenerated messages as comparison standards for AI-generated\nones.\nSchmälzle and Wilcox (2022) study randomly selected\nhuman-generated messages from the scrapped tweets. In this study,\nwe randomly selected human-generated tweets as well, but this\ntime, from the retweeted messages only. Retweeting represents\nan objective outcome that is easy to assess and one of the gold\nstandards of messaging success (\nDellaVigna and Gentzkow, 2010 ;\nRhodes and Ewoldsen, 2013 ). In other words, retweeted messages\ncontain elements deemed more worthy of sharing by audiences\n(\nDmochowski et al., 2014 ; Pei et al., 2019 ). Thus, by comparing AI-\ngenerated messages to retweeted human-generated messages, this\nstudy examined the feasibility of using the message engine to not\nsimply generate new FA messages, but to generate those that are at\nleast on par with the content people share with others.\nWith these innovations and modiﬁcations, we examined\nthe potential of AI LLMs for health awareness generation.\nSpeciﬁcally, we postulated the following hypothesis based on the\nprevious literature:\nH1: AI-generated messages would be at least on par with\nthe retweeted human-generated content in terms of quality\nand clarity.\nWe tested our hypothesis by conducting two rounds of online\nstudy, one using a college sample and another using the young\nadult women (ages 25-35) sample. In addition, we examined the\ngeneral characteristics of the AI-generated messages compared\nto the human generated messages exhibited through a mix of\nqualitative assessment and detailed computational analyses of the\ngenerated messages.\nRQ1: How do AI-generated messages compare to the retweeted\nhuman-generated content in terms of semantic structure,\nsentiment, and readability?\nRQ2: What is the feasibility of awareness message generation in\ngeneral and particularly the novel strategy, i.e., using the Bloom\nLLM with a prompting approach?\n/two.tnum. Method\nIn this section, we provide details about the human and\ncomputational analysis methods we used to test H1 and answer\nRQ1. First, we describe the architecture of the message generation\nsystem (called message engine) and how the system was used\nto generate messages (via so-called prompt engineering), Then\nwe outline the two participant samples we recruited for our\nhuman evaluation study as well as the methods used for the\ncomputational analyses.\n/two.tnum./one.tnum. Description of Bloom, state-of-the-art\nNLP model\nAs mentioned above, we used Bloom, the latest and largest\nopen-source multilingual large language model. Bloom is powered\nby a transformer-based ANN architecture that is similar to that\nof OpenAI’s GPT-3. For feasibility, we used the second largest\nversion (7B1) with 7 billion neural network parameters for this\nstudy. Bloom 7B1 was trained on 1.5 TB of pre-processed text\nfrom 45 natural and 12 programming languages (\nScao et al., 2022 )\nincluding, for example, the Wikipedia and the Semantic Scholar\nOpen Research Corpus (\nLaurençon et al., 2022 ). As previously\nmentioned, instead of ﬁne-tuning this model as done in previous\nresearch (\nSchmälzle and Wilcox, 2022 ), here we used a prompting-\nbased generation strategy. See Figure 1 for a conceptual diagram of\nmessage generation via Bloom.\n/two.tnum./two.tnum. Message generation protocol\n/two.tnum./two.tnum./one.tnum. Step /one.tnum: collecting retweeted\nhuman-generated tweets\nThe ﬁrst step consisted of scraping FA messages from Twitter.\nUsing the snscrape package (\nSnscrape, 2021 ) in python, we\ncollected all tweets with #folic acid or #folate on Twitter (no date\nconstraints). This yielded a base corpus of 42,646 raw messages,\nwhich were exported into a csv-ﬁle and sorted by retweeted count.\nThe top 50 tweets were selected and ﬁltered for duplicates and\nnon-English text. Next, to exclude messages that had obvious\nother goals than promoting FA awareness (e.g. selling nutritional\nsupplements), we also removed tweets that included shopping-\nrelated words (e.g., buy, order, sale). This resulted in 28 tweets,\nto which we then added the next two most retweeted to obtain\nthe 30 most retweeted human-generated tweets about FA. We\nalso visually inspected these tweets as well as their sources.\nFrontiers in Communication /zero.tnum/five.tnum frontiersin.org\nLim and Schmälzle /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fcomm./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum./one.tnum/one.tnum/two.tnum/nine.tnum/zero.tnum/eight.tnum/two.tnum\nFIGURE /one.tnum\nMessage generation system leveraging Bloom, a large pretrained lan guage model in combination with prompt engineering to generate healt h\nawareness messages about folic acid (\nVaswani et al., /two.tnum/zero.tnum/one.tnum/seven.tnum).\nWe found that half (15) of the 30 tweets came from oﬃcial\nsources, including Center for Disease Control (CDC), World\nHealth Organization (WHO), and the United States Department\nof Health and Human Services (HHS). One can argue that\nthese sources were sending the tweets with the goal of health\npromotion/education, and that their writing quality reﬂects at least\nthe average (or better) message quality achieved on social media\nthese days by such sources. The tweet IDs can be found in the\nSupplementary material.\n/two.tnum./two.tnum./two.tnum. Step /two.tnum: prompt engineering\nAs prompting can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the generated\nmessages ( Liu et al., 2023 ), prompts were crafted based on the\nsentence structure of the most retweeted messages. Starting from\nthe most retweeted message, the beginning phrases of each of\nthe tweets were examined and selected as long as the phrase did\nnot contain too much information about folic acid. Candidate\nprompts were discarded if we observed the following red ﬂags: too\nmany of the same messages without much informative content,\ntoo many names of oﬃcial organizations or countries, or clearly\nfalse information. Some phrases were also modiﬁed and tested\nas prompts. For example, instead of using “Consume #folicacid:, ”\nwe modiﬁed the prompt to “Consume folic acid:” Using this\nprocedure, we engineered the following prompts: “It’s National\nFolic Acid Awareness week, ” “Every woman needs #folicacid\nevery day, ” “Did you know, #Folicacid, ” “Consuming folic acid\nis important because, ” “Consuming folic acid:” and “Folic acid\nduring pregnancy.”\n/two.tnum./two.tnum./three.tnum. Step /three.tnum: AI message generation\nUsing the transformer python package, we provided the\nconstructed prompts to the Bloom language model to generate two\npools of sample messages: A ﬁrst (smaller) pool of 600 messages was\ngenerated and tested in the human and computational evaluation\nstudies. Second, we expanded this smaller pool into a large\npool of 3000 messages (for computational evaluation only, see\nSupplementary material). Other than varying the input prompts,\nthe generation command used ﬁxed values for the parameters\nmaximum result length, sampling, temperature, top-k, and top-p.\nThe maximum result length speciﬁes the amount of text to be\ngenerated and was set to 60 tokens ( ∼ 45 words) to roughly match\nthe character limit of Twitter messages. The other parameters\nallow the precision and randomness of the generated messages.\nBy setting the parameter do_sample = True, we instructed the\nmodel to use the sampling approach, which means that the model\nwill calculate the conditional probability of each word that was\nstored via training and randomly selected based on the probability.\nSampling was chosen over other methods in order to add some\nvariation into the text generation, modeling after the variations that\nexist in natural human language (\nHoltzman et al., 2019 ; Wolf et al.,\n2020). We then determined the sampling temperature, or how much\nrandomness is allowed in generating the text after the prompt. The\ntemperature was set to 0.7 to follow the recommended levels for\nmultiple or longer text generation (\nMisri, 2021 ). Next, top-k and\ntop-p sampling strategies were used in combination in order to\nallow for variation in generated text while preventing words with\nlow calculated probabilities from being selected (\nFan et al., 2018 ;\nvon Platen, 2020 ; top_k = 40, top_p = 0.9).\nFrontiers in Communication /zero.tnum/six.tnum frontiersin.org\nLim and Schmälzle /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fcomm./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum./one.tnum/one.tnum/two.tnum/nine.tnum/zero.tnum/eight.tnum/two.tnum\nUsing these parameters, we ﬁrst generated a message pool for\nthe human evaluation studies (see step 4). Next, based on reviewer\nfeedback, we expanded this smaller pool of 600 messages inta a\nlarge pool of 3,000 messages. Because it is not feasible to submit\nthis number of messages to human evaluation, the results of the\ncomputational analysis of these messages will be reported in the\nSupplementary material.\n/two.tnum./two.tnum./four.tnum. Step /four.tnum: selecting AI-generated messages for\nevaluation\nAfter generating the messages, the following procedure was\nused to select 30 messages for comparison against human generated\nmessages. Using a random number generator, 10 messages\nwere randomly selected from each of the generated messages\nfor each prompt source. Among the 10 messages, messages\nwere discarded if we found the following exclusion criteria:\n(1) clear false information, (2) speciﬁc references to non-US\nspeciﬁc organizations (e.g., NHS, UK, Scotland, Netherlands),\n(3) references to sources that could not be veriﬁed [e.g., ”the\nrecommended intake of 400 mg/day is based on a meta-analysis of\nrandomized controlled trials (RCTs)], and (4) recipes that include\nfolic acid. In addition, two of the 60 randomly selected messages\nwere discarded because they included characters in diﬀerent\nlanguages or had repetitive phrases. If more than 5 messages passed\nthe exclusion criteria, then we selected the messages that included\nmore content than hashtags or diﬀered from other included\nmessages. Finally, the selected messages were cleaned (e.g., &amp\nchanged to &, end part of the messages deleted if the sentence\nwas not complete). These messages were then used for the human\nand computational analyses (and the large pool was analyzed\ncomputationally—see\nSupplementary material).\n/two.tnum./three.tnum. Human evaluation\n/two.tnum./three.tnum./one.tnum. Participants\nUniversity Sample: Participants were recruited from a study\npool and received course credits as compensation for the study,\nwhich was approved by the local review board. Responses from\nparticipants who completed the survey at an unrealistically fast\nspeed ( <4 mins) or failed to complete the survey were discarded.\nThe ﬁnal dataset included N = 109 respondents ( mage = 19.6,\nsdage = 1.42), with 70% being female ( nf = 84). Since folic acid\nis especially signiﬁcant for stages during pregnancy, the high\nproportion of female participants ﬁt the purpose of our study.\nWe also conducted a power analysis using the pwr package in R\n(\nChampely, 2020) for a one-sample and one-sided t-test, with eﬀect\nsize d = 0.3 and signiﬁcance level α = 0.05. Sample size of 100\nwas enough to detect signiﬁcance at the power level of.9. Moreover,\nwe relied on evidence suggesting that a sample of this size is more\nthan suﬃcient to select best-performing messages as candidates for\ncampaigns (\nKim and Cappella, 2019 ).\nYoung Adult Women Sample: To have a sample with a less\nnarrow age demographic than the college student sample, we\nalso recruited participants from Proliﬁc, a subject recruitment\nplatform for online studies (\nPalan and Schitter, 2018 ). Speciﬁcally,\nwe used the pre-screening questions via Proliﬁc to restrict our\nparticipant pool to females ages 25-35 who lived with their spouses\nor signiﬁcant others. We speciﬁcally selected females ages 25-35\nbecause in the U.S the median age for the ﬁrst pregnancy is 30\nyears in age (\nMorse, 2022 ). We selected an age range around 30 in\nan attempt to capture realistic ages during which women may start\nplanning their ﬁrst child. Although we did not speciﬁcally ask about\nfamily planning because of privacy concerns, the reasoning was\nthat those who lived with their spouses or signiﬁcant others may\nnaturally be more inclined to consider pregnancy, and certainly\nmore so than the university sample. Moreover, given that a large\nnumber of pregnancies occur spontaneously within this age range,\nthis sample overlaps with the primary audience of folic acid\nawareness campaigns. A total number of 40 participants responded\nto the survey ( mage = 31.15, sdage = 2.99), a number chosen in line\nwith the recommendations of\nKim and Cappella (2019) for message\nevaluation study sample sizes. Each participant received $2.50 for\ntheir participation in the study (about $9.50 per hour).\n/two.tnum./three.tnum./two.tnum. Procedure\nBoth studies (university sample and young adult women\nsample) were conducted online via Qualtrics, and participants were\nnot told in advance which of the messages were AI-generated or\nhuman generated; they were only told that the purpose of the\nstudy was to evaluate health messages related to folic acid. Once\nparticipants consented to the study, they were asked to evaluate\nthe quality and clarity of the messages in blocks. Message order\nwas randomized within each block and approximately half of the\nsample started with the ﬁrst question, the other half started with the\nsecond block. The two survey items were adopted from\nSchmälzle\nand Wilcox (2022). The quality of the message measure asked,\n“How much do you agree that the content and the quality of this\nmessage is appropriate to increase public knowledge about folic acid, ”\nand responses varied from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly\nagree). The clarity of the message measure stated, “Please evaluate\nthe following messages in terms of whether they are clear and easy to\nunderstand, ”with 1 meaning very unclear and 5 meaning very clear.\nSurvey data were downloaded and further processed in python.\nSpeciﬁcally, we computed by-message averages for each question\nand averaged across the blocks of AI- and human-generated\nmessages, respectively. To answer H1, we used the scipy-package\n(\nVirtanen et al., 2020 ) to test for diﬀerences between AI- and\nhuman-generated messages in each measure ( α - level of.05).\nFurthermore, the participant sample was also split by sex (due to\nthe relevancy of folic acid during pregnancy).\n/two.tnum./three.tnum./three.tnum. Computational evaluation\nThe goal of the computational analyses was to examine\nthe characteristics of the AI- and human-generated messages.\nSpeciﬁcally, we examined the AI-generated and human-generated\nmessages via several common text analytic methods in python in R,\nincluding N-gram analysis, semantic analysis, readability analysis,\ntopic modeling, and sentiment analysis. Through n-gram analysis\nand semantic analysis, we hoped to examine the similarities in the\nword distributions and the general attributes of the sentences. The\nreadability analysis examined how easy the AI-generated messages\nFrontiers in Communication /zero.tnum/seven.tnum frontiersin.org\nLim and Schmälzle /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fcomm./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum./one.tnum/one.tnum/two.tnum/nine.tnum/zero.tnum/eight.tnum/two.tnum\nTABLE /one.tnum Results from the online survey that asked participants to rate AI-generated and human-generated messages in terms of clarity and quality.\nUniversity sample Young adult women sample\nAI-\ngenerated\nHuman-\ngenerated\nt\n(p-value)\nAI-\ngenerated\nHuman-\ngenerated\nt\n(p-value)\nClarity 3.77\n(0.55)\n3.22\n(0.43)\n4.32\n(<0.001)\n4.38\n(0.58)\n3.79\n(0.51)\n4.27\n(<0.001)\nQuality 3.65\n(0.42)\n3.12\n(0.33)\n5.39\n(<0.001)\n4.08\n(0.38)\n3.36\n(0.51)\n6.11\n(<0.001)\nLeft: University Sample; Right: Young Adult Women Sample.

Using topic modeling ( Blei, 2012 ) and sentiment\nanalysis (Hutto and Gilbert, 2014 ; Hirschberg and Manning, 2015 ),\nwe examined the similarities and diﬀerences in the discussed topics\nand the general sentiment of the messages. These analyses were\ncarried out using python and R packages including spacy, textacy,\nvader, and the sentence-transformers (\nHornik and Grün, 2011 ;\nHutto and Gilbert, 2014 ; Reimers and Gurevych, 2019 ; DeWilde,\n2020; Matthew et al., 2020 ).\n/three.tnum. Results\nThis study examined the feasibility to use the Bloom message\nengine to generate clear, eﬀective, and novel awareness messages.\nIn this section, we show how the AI-generated messages compared\nto retweeted human-generated messages in terms of clarity and\nquality from the online survey studies with the university and\nyoung adult women samples (H1). Next, we describe characteristics\nof the generated messages and present the results from the\ncomputational methods (RQ2).\n/three.tnum./one.tnum. Results from the human evaluation\nstudy (H/one.tnum)\nWe ﬁrst analyzed the data from the university sample. The\nresults from the one-sample t-test supported H1 (see\nTable 1). In\nfact, AI-generated messages were rated signiﬁcantly higher than\nhuman-generated tweets for both dimensions—message clarity\n(tclarity = 4.32, p < 0.001) and message quality ( tquality = 5.39,\np < 0.001).\nFigure 2 also shows the result for each dimension\nfor the full population. On average, the participants rated AI-\ngenerated and human-generated messages as relatively clear and\neasy to understand and containing quality content appropriate to\nincrease FA awareness (ratings > 3 out of 5). However, the left\ngraph of\nFigure 2A shows that the distribution of the AI-generated\nmessages was concentrated toward the top (around 4) while\nhuman-generated messages had a slightly more even distribution,\nconcentrated around 3-3.5. The distribution for females appeared\nwider than for males, with more AI-generated messages rated\nhigher than human-generated messages. In addition, for males,\nAI-generated messages on average seemed similarly rated as the\nhuman-generated messages in terms of clarity. This may be the\ncase because many FA messages referred to the importance of\nconsuming the vitamin during pregnancy, which may not apply to\ncollege-age males.\nNext, we computed the same analysis for the young adult\nwomen sample. As for the analyses of the university sample,\nthe results from the one-sample t-test comparing ratings for\nthe young adult women sample supported H1 (see\nTable 1). In\nfact, AI-generated messages were rated signiﬁcantly higher than\nhuman-generated tweets for both dimensions—message clarity\n(tclarity = 4.27, p <0.01) and message quality ( tquality = 6.11, p\n<0.01). On average, the participants rated AI-generated messages\nas relatively clear and easy to understand and containing quality\ncontent appropriate to increase FA awareness (ratings > 3 out of\n5). However, the ratings for the human-generated tweets had a\nwider range depending on the tweet.\nFigure 2B also shows that the\ndistribution of the AI-generated messages was concentrated toward\nthe top (above 4) while human-generated messages had a slightly\nmore even distribution, concentrated around 3–3.5.\n/three.tnum./two.tnum. Qualitative characteristics of the\ngenerated messages and computational\nanalyses (RQ/two.tnum)\nIn terms of usability, the Bloom message engine was much more\neﬃcient and simpler to use compared to the GPT-2 model used\nin the previous study. The main appeal of Bloom is its ability of\nzero-shot learning, or the capability of generating messages with\nprompting, and the fact that it does not require a resource-intensive\nﬁne-tuning process. Because of this feature, we were able to start\nthe message-generation process right away. While harnessing the\nmessage engine requires some familiarity with python coding,\nonline resources with explanations of the coding made the process\neasy to learn (e.g.,\nWolf et al., 2020 ; Theron, 2022 ; Tunstall et al.,\n2022). The most time-consuming part was preparing for prompt\nengineering (e.g., scraping and cleaning the tweets, which took a\nfew days to complete). However, now that the codebase exists, the\nprompt engineering process can be replicated quickly and made\nmore ﬂexible and comfortable for users. Once the ﬁnal prompts\nwere determined, the actual message generation process was fast.\nLoading the Bloom 7B1 model into Google Colab and generating\n600 messages took a little over an hour. Overall, the model was fast\nand eﬃcient to use, and we can expect that AI message generation\nsystems will become even simpler to use in the future as the\ntechnology becomes commodiﬁed.\nFrontiers in Communication /zero.tnum/eight.tnum frontiersin.org\nLim and Schmälzle /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fcomm./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum./one.tnum/one.tnum/two.tnum/nine.tnum/zero.tnum/eight.tnum/two.tnum\nFIGURE /two.tnum\nResults from human evaluation study.

First, the\ngenerated messages showed diﬀering characteristics based on the\nstructure of the prompts. When prompts included #folicacid, the\ngenerated messages also included hashtags and included features\nthat are characteristic of tweet messages. For instance, the prompt\n“Did you know, #Folicacid” generated text such as “Did you know,\n#Folicacid is one of the most important invitations in our daily\ndiet?...So make sure to have it daily! #FolicAcid #VitaminB. . . ” On\nthe other hand, when prompts did not include hashtags, the tone\nappeared to be more formal, and the content tended to include\nmore factual information about folic acid. The prompt, “Consuming\nfolic acid is important because, ” for example, generated text such as\n“Consuming folic acid is important because it helps prevent neural\ntube defects, which are birth defects in the brain and spinal cord. Folic\nacid is also necessary for healthy blood cells and nerve cells, and for\nmaintaining healthy red blood cells. . . .” These results point to how\nprompt technology can be used to strategically control qualities and\ntone of the AI-generated content, which is a fundamental feature.\nNext, the results from the computational analysis\n/six.tnumshowed that\nAI-generated and human-generated messages were similar in terms\nof word distributions, topics discussed, semantics, readability,\nand sentiment (see\nTable 2; Figure 3). For instance, the uni-\nand bi-grams show that both AI-generated and human-generated\nmessages contain the words related to neural tube and birth defects,\nfocused generally on folic acid, pregnancy, and health topics. An\nanalysis of text readability statistics (\nFlesch, 1948) showed that AI-\ngenerated messages were as easy to read, if not easier to read,\ncompared to the human-generated messages ( mFlesch− ScoreAI =\n68.4, mFlesch− Scorehuman = 63.4; n.s.). Next, a sentiment analysis\nusing the valence-aware dictionary approach (V ADER) showed no\nsigniﬁcant diﬀerences in terms of message sentiment, although\nnominally the AI-generated messages again ranked slightly\nhigher (i.e., more positive sentiment; mVaderCompoundAI = 0.25,\nmFVaderCompoundhuman = 0.23; n.s.). Overall, these analyses showed\nthat there were no major diﬀerences between the AI-generated and\nhuman-generated messages.\nNext, we focused on topics covered and semantic properties\nof the messages: A topic modeling analysis showed that both AI\nand human-generated messages discussed similar topics centered\naround pregnancy, birth defects, and essential vitamins. One\nobservation is that the AI-generated messages appeared to weigh\nthe topics of pregnancy and risk of birth defects more heavily.\n/six.tnum Note that these results refer to the ﬁrst pool of messages that wa s\nalso evaluated in the human evaluation studies.

The semantic similarity analysis illustrates the cosine similarities between the pe r-sentence embedding\nvectors. The top /three.tnum/zero.tnum messages are from the AI generation, the bottom /three.tnum/zero.tnum messages represent the human generated ones.\nLastly, we conducted an analysis of semantic similarities between\nall messages using the sentence-transformer package. This analysis\nasked how similar the sentence vectors of each of the 60 messages\n(30 AI-generated and 30 human messages) were to each other, as\nassessed via cosine similarity. As can be seen in\nFigure 3, the AI-\ngenerated messages were more similar to each other ( msimilarityAI\n= 0.59, msimilarityhuman = 0.43; p < 0.001; note that while we\nremoved prompts for other analyses, we included prompts here\nbecause the semantic similarity analysis requires entire sentences).\nAs illustrated by\nFigure 3, a block-like structure separates the AI-\ngenerated messages from the rest, and within the AI messages,\nsubblocks or similarity clusters exist. Importantly, all messages\nare fairly similar to each other in this semantics measure, with\nan average similarity score of about 0.5. In sum, these analyses\nconﬁrm that the AI-generated messages were on topic, readable,\nand generally positive in tone.\n/four.tnum. Discussion\nThis study examined the feasibility of using the Bloom message\nengine to generate clear and high-quality awareness messages and\ntested the potential of prompt-engineering to steer the message\ncreation process. Overall, the Bloom message engine was easy to use\nand proﬁcient in generating messages. Across two samples, human\nraters perceive AI-generated messages as easy to understand and\nappropriate to increase public knowledge about folic acid.\nThe most important result is that both human evaluation\nstudies clearly supported hypothesis 1: Human evaluators rated\nthe AI-generated messages as more clear and as higher in quality\ncompared to the retweeted human-generated messages. This\nresult was even more pronounced in the young adult women\nsample, whose pre-screened demographics ensured that the sample\nmatches the audience of folic acid awareness campaigns. But the\nsame result was also present among the university sample, and also\nin the men within this sample. Thus, the ﬁndings are robust across\ndiﬀerent groups.\nThe ﬁnding that AI-generated messages compare favorably\nagainst human-generated messages is also noteworthy in light\nof the fact that human-generated messages comprised messages\nselected based on their retweet count. In other words, rather\nthan using any messages, retweeted messages arguably pose a\nhigher comparison standard; although we cannot know what\nthe motivations behind retweeting FA-messages were, it seems\nFrontiers in Communication /one.tnum/zero.tnum frontiersin.org\nLim and Schmälzle /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fcomm./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum./one.tnum/one.tnum/two.tnum/nine.tnum/zero.tnum/eight.tnum/two.tnum\nplausible that they contain elements that people deem worthy of\nsharing with others. Therefore, the current results underscore that\nthe Bloom-based message engine can generate awareness messages\nthat surpass even the retweeted human messages. For obvious\nethical reasons, we refrained from actually disseminating the AI-\ngenerated messages on social media, but we argue that it would be\nlikely that they would also be shared more often. The potential to\ngo viral is one of social media’s most notable features when it comes\nto health communication because viral messages can reach billions\nof people across the globe to spread awareness about certain topics.\nIn summary, the current results conﬁrm that the Bloom message\nengine has a high potential to generate clear and high-quality\ncontent for awareness messages.\nMoving beyond the human evaluation results, qualitative\nand computational analyses of the generated messages provided\nfurther insights about the characteristics of AI-generated content.\nThe computational analyses demonstrated that the AI-generated\nmessages are similar to the human-generated messages in speciﬁc\nquantitative text characteristics like word distributions, readability,\nsentiment, discussed topics, and general semantic similarity. One\ndistinct feature was that AI-generated messages seemed to contain\nmore words related to prevention. Perhaps this speaks to the\ndiﬀerences in tweets vs. AI-generated messages. Messages may\nexhibit a tendency to have more positive sentiment and focus on\nthe importance of folic acid (e.g., preventing neural tube defects).\nThis all points to the enormous potential of the Bloom model in\ncombination with prompt engineering, whose role in this ﬁeld is\nlikely to explode over the next few years.\nOur study also illustrates that even without additional training\nwith topic-speciﬁc datasets (i.e., ﬁne-tuning), the Bloom-based\nmodel (“message engine”) can generate focused, clear, and\nappropriate awareness campaign messages. This goes beyond\nprevious work that had relied on ﬁne-tuning (\nSchmälzle and\nWilcox, 2022), which requires costly retraining, time, and is overall\nmore challenging. Since the system used can generate hundreds\nof messages within a few hours, it can help alleviate the burden\nof cost and manpower required in creating health communication\nmessages. Moreover, the prompt-engineering strategy employed\nhere allows researchers to steer the content and sentiment of\nthe generated messages (e.g., informal setting to ﬁt social media,\nor formal to ﬁt professional settings). This feature is extremely\npromising because it allows communicators to infuse strategy\nand theory into the AI generation process, which otherwise\nwould remain a “creative black box.” Importantly, after the AI-\nbased message generation itself, health researchers could still ﬁlter\nthrough all messages to select and modify them, or to enter\npromising candidates back into the system as prompts to try to\ngenerate more of their kind. An important note here is that the\nmessage engine is not meant to be the decision-maker. Rather, it\nis a tool that is meant to support the health researcher to save\ncost, personnel ressources, and time, and to add a replicable, but\ncreative element to the generation process. In all practical use cases,\nethics and legal aspects would obviously still require the presence\nof humans as curators of content.\nAnother application area of the AI-message engine is that\nit can be used to generate messages for topics beyond simple\nawareness messaging (\nBaclic et al., 2020 ). As argued above, we\ndeliberately focused on awareness as a fundamental goal of health\ncommunication (\nBettinghaus, 1986 ; McGuire, 2001 ), but clearly,\nit will be promising to explore the potential of this approach\nto inﬂuence health-related attitudes and behaviors. Furthermore,\ngiven the rise of image generation as a visual complement to text\ngeneration, it would also be interesting to start generating health-\nrelated imagery and combine such messages with AI-generated\ntexts (\nCrowson et al., 2022 ). This is especially important because\nnewer social media platforms are increasingly depending on visuals\n(e.g., Snapchat, TikTok). Overall, we anticipate that this work will\nﬁnd many applications in health communication in the near future,\nand similar cases could be made for other communication topics\n(e.g., environmental and political communication) or applied\nbusiness communication (e.g., AI-copywriting systems, which are\nalready oﬀered commercially).\nGoing beyond the obvious application potential, we next ask\nabout the theoretical potential and contributions of this work. At\nﬁrst glance, it might be tempting to view AI message generation\nas a methodological innovation only, but we argue that the advent\nof natural text generation systems holds immense potential for\nmethod-theory synergy (\nGreenwald, 2012 ; Weber et al., 2018 ):\nSpeciﬁcally, a healthy mix of theory, measurement, and control is\ncentral to the progress of any science ( Bechtel, 2008 ; Chalmers,\n2013; Craver and Darden, 2013 ). Put simply, our theories aﬀect\nthe phenomenon we can conceive of and use to explain the\nphenomenon in question. Our measures, in turn, determine what\nphenomena we can “see” and with which precision. Lastly, the\nability to control lets us “push things around, ” manipulating or\nintervening causally on variables to test our theories. In physics,\nchemistry, and biology, the triad of theory, measurement, and\ncontrol enabled everything from understanding atoms and genetics\n(on the basic science side) to building mechanical engines and\nsynthetically assembled vaccines (on the applied side). In NLP ,\nthe advent of powerful theories that enable machines to generate\nnatural text clearly represents a breakthrough in the quest to\nunderstand, measure, and control linguistic or even cognitive\ncapacities (\nLeCun et al., 2015 ; Mitchell, 2019). As we saw from the\nresults of this study, this advancement from powerful theories in\nNLP has many implications for communication (\nHassabis et al.,\n2017; Lake et al., 2017 ; Dubova, 2022).\nCritically, however, we are not claiming that these advances\nhave solved long-standing theoretical questions about the nature\nof language, let alone symbolic communication—it’s quite the\nopposite. So far, progress in language modeling has focused on\nlanguage-intrinsic aspects (e.g. syntax and semantics;\nBender and\nKoller, 2020), whereas pragmatic and extralinguistic processes that\nare critical to communication have been almost ignored. However,\nthe verbal distinction between semantics and pragmatics has always\nbeen cumbersome since the underlying phenomena appear to\ngradually blend into each other. The current work thus represents\na step to bridge between NLP and communication, albeit only an\ninitial one. Moreover, the fact that human participants evaluated\nthe AI-generated messages as even better than human-generated\nones (and as better as even the most highly shared human-\ngenerated messages) underscores the importance of this approach.\nIn addition to potentially surpassing human-level performance\nfor message generation, another theoretical beneﬁt of AI systems\nFrontiers in Communication /one.tnum/one.tnum frontiersin.org\nLim and Schmälzle /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fcomm./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum./one.tnum/one.tnum/two.tnum/nine.tnum/zero.tnum/eight.tnum/two.tnum\nis that they are rigorously quantitative. While it is often claimed\nthat deep learning is like a “black box” (\nMarcus and Davis, 2019 ;\nXu et al., 2019 ; Chen et al., 2020 ), this is actually not the case:\nRather, each of Bloom’s over seven billion parameters are computed\nand thus, in principle, objectively knowable.\n/seven.tnumThis again points\nto a key feature of science because it aﬀords better measurement,\nbetter control, and ultimately better theoretical understanding.\nIndeed, one could perhaps compare AI models to the “Petri dish”\nin chemistry, i.e., as providing a precisely controlled experimental\nsetting in which researchers can generate synthetic messages\nunder controlled laboratory conditions, and later test how they\nfare in the market. This promotes insights into properties that\nmake messages eﬀective, an issue that still remains insuﬃciently\nunderstood (\nHarrington, 2015 , 2016; O’Keefe and Hoeken, 2021 ).\nIn this sense, especially the prompt engineering process, which has\nbeen successfully applied here, has barely scratched the surface of\nwhat is possible—and needed—to fully realize the potential of this\napplied fruit of a theoretically matured science of messages.\nThe emergence of AI-based methods for communication\ncontent generation clearly raises important ethical issues. Examples\nof existing issues include bots in the political domain (which\nspread misinformation), online troll farms (which stoke conﬂict),\nor general misuse of persuasive technologies for target advertising\nor mood, and emotion intervention (\nSolaiman et al., 2019 ; Kreps\net al., 2020 ). At this point, there is no clear regulatory framework\nfor these technologies. Although a few “responsible AI” initiatives\nexist, the novelty of the topic and the evolving nature of the\nunderlying science prevent any ﬁnal judgment. However, the\ncreators of Bloom have attempted to address this issue by releasing\nBloom under a RAIL license (responsible AI license,\nContractor\net al., 2020 ), which includes a number of disallowed use cases,\nlike generating law-violating content. Among these cases is using\nBloom for medical purposes. Clearly, given the LLMs’ lack of\nmedical knowledge (\nSchmälzle and Wilcox, 2022 ), it would be\nirresponsible to use the model to generate diagnoses and prescribe\ntreatment. On the other hand, using the model to improve\ngeneral health awareness information seems like a particularly\nbeneﬁcial use case for how LLMs (under supervision by health\ncommunication experts acting as message curators) could be used\nfor social good and to improve the quality of public health\ninformation. With this in mind, we also want to underscore the\nimportance that communication researchers engage with and help\nshape this debate.\nLike all research, the current paper has several limitations.\nFirst, we tested only one topic, folic acid. Although this was an\ninformed choice based on the characteristics of this particular\nhealth topic, it will be necessary to expand these ﬁndings to other\ndomains. Second, we focused only on health messages designed to\nraise awareness but ignored more downstream topics like attitude\nand behavior change. Again, we argue that this provides a logical\nstarting point, but that more work needs to be done to expand\n/seven.tnum Granted, this mindboggling complexity prevents us from understanding\nthe system behavior intuitively, which is what people mean whe n they call\nit a black box. However, except for deliberately random paramet ers, the\nsystems behave deterministically, and, in this sense, the b lack box metaphor\nis mistaken.\nto other topics within health communication. Relatedly, we only\ngenerated relatively short messages, such as the ones we ﬁnd on\nsocial media (primarily twitter). However, health communication\ntakes many forms, and as such more work is needed to generate\ne.g., health-related stories (longer text) or images (no text at\nall, but a diﬀerent modality). Third, the computational and\nhuman evaluations of the generated messages could be improved.\nRegarding the computational analyses, we only focused on a\nnumber of salient and quantiﬁable characteristics, like NGrams,\nsentiment, and reading ease. However, there are additional topics\nthat were not explored, such as similarity of the entire corpora of\nhuman and AI-generated messages, other theoretical concepts (e.g.\nuse of politeness instead of general sentiment\nYeomans et al., 2019 ,\nor the use of speciﬁc kinds of persuasive strategies ( Armstrong,\n2010; Tan et al., 2016 ; O’Keefe and Hoeken, 2021 ). Again, this\nlimitation is explained by the early stage of this research—this\nis only the third study of this kind that we are aware of—\nand we look forward to future work expanding the scope of\ncomputational message analytics. Finally, human evaluation is\nnot without limitations either. In particular, one could criticize\nthe narrow measures and the sample. Regarding the latter, we\nargue that the populations we sampled from (college students and\nyoung adult women living with a partner) overlaps with the target\npopulation for a FA awareness campaign (potential parents and\nparticularly women of childbearing age), but it would be advisable\nto also test how broader audiences respond to these messages.\n/five.tnum. Conclusions\nAt the start of this paper, we asked readers to guess which of the\ntwo messages came from an AI. The answer is that it was the ﬁrst\nmessage, and the fact that most readers could only guess the correct\nanswer aﬃrms our main ﬁndings. Speciﬁcally, the Bloom message\nengine was easy to use, the generated messages were generally on\npar with human messages in terms of quantitative characteristics,\nand they were rated as clearer and of higher quality compared\nto even the most retweeted human messages. Thus, the message\nengine could be used to alleviate the bottleneck in the message\ngeneration process for health awareness messages. Overall, this\napproach oﬀers fruitful ground to use quantitative methods to\nexamine the generation, content, and reception of messages.\nData availability statement\nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this\narticle will be made available by the authors, without\nundue reservation.\nEthics statement\nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and\napproved by Institutional Review Board, Michigan State University.\nThe patients/participants provided their written informed consent\nto participate in this study.\nFrontiers in Communication /one.tnum/two.tnum frontiersin.org\nLim and Schmälzle /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fcomm./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/three.tnum./one.tnum/one.tnum/two.tnum/nine.tnum/zero.tnum/eight.tnum/two.tnum\nAuthor contributions\nSL contributed by leading the project, planning and\ncollecting data, and writing most of the manuscript.
