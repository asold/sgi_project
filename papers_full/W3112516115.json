Our\ncode is available at: https://github.com/hila-\nchefer/Transformer-Explainability.\n1. Introduction\nTransformers and derived methods [41, 9, 22, 30] are\ncurrently the state-of-the-art methods in almost all NLP\nbenchmarks. The power of these methods has led to their\nadoption in the ﬁeld of language and vision [23, 40, 38].\nMore recently, Transformers have become a leading tool\nin traditional computer vision tasks, such as object detec-\ntion [4] and image recognition [6, 11]. The importance of\nTransformer networks necessitates tools for the visualiza-\ntion of their decision process. Such a visualization can aid\nin debugging the models, help verify that the models are fair\nand unbiased, and enable downstream tasks.\nThe main building block of Transformer networks are\nself-attention layers [29, 7], which assign a pairwise atten-\ntion value between every two tokens. In NLP, a token is\ntypically a word or a word part. In vision, each token can\nbe associated with a patch [11, 4]. A common practice when\ntrying to visualize Transformer models is, therefore, to con-\nsider these attentions as a relevancy score [41, 43, 4]. This is\nusually done for a single attention layer. Another option is\nto combine multiple layers. Simply averaging the attentions\nobtained for each token, would lead to blurring of the sig-\nnal and would not consider the different roles of the layers:\ndeeper layers are more semantic, but each token accumu-\nlates additional context each time self-attention is applied.\nThe rollout method [1] is an alternative, which reassigns all\nattention scores by considering the pairwise attentions and\nassuming that attentions are combined linearly into subse-\nquent contexts. The method seems to improve results over\nthe utilization of a single attention layer. However, as we\nshow, by relying on simplistic assumptions, irrelevant to-\nkens often become highlighted.\nIn this work, we follow the line of work that assigns rel-\nevancy and propagates it, such that the sum of relevancy\nis maintained throughout the layers [27]. While the ap-\nplication of such methods to Transformers has been at-\ntempted [42], this was done in a partial way that does not\npropagate attention throughout all layers.\nTransformer networks heavily rely on skip connection\nand attention operators, both involving the mixing of two\nactivation maps, and each leading to unique challenges.\nMoreover, Transformers apply non-linearities other than\nReLU, which result in both positive and negative features.\nBecause of the non-positive values, skip connections lead,\nif not carefully handled, to numerical instabilities. Meth-\nods such as LRP [3] for example, tend to fail in such cases.\nSelf-attention layers form a challenge since a naive propa-\ngation through these would not maintain the total amount of\nrelevancy.\nWe handle these challenges by ﬁrst introducing a rele-\nvancy propagation rule that is applicable to both positive\nand negative attributions. Second, we present a normal-\nization term for non-parametric layers, such as “add” ( e.g.\nskip-connection) and matrix multiplication. Third, we in-\ntegrate the attention and the relevancy scores, and combine\nthe integrated results for multiple attention blocks.\nMany of the interpretability methods used in computer\nvision are not class-speciﬁc in practice, i.e., return the same\n1\narXiv:2012.09838v2  [cs.CV]  5 Apr 2021\nvisualization regardless of the class one tries to visualize,\neven for images that contain multiple objects. The class-\nspeciﬁc signal, especially for methods that propagate all the\nway to the input, is often blurred by the salient regions of\nthe image. Some methods avoid this by not propagating to\nthe lower layers [32], while other methods contrast differ-\nent classes to emphasize the differences [15]. Our method\nprovides the class-based separation by design and it is the\nonly Transformer visualization method, as far as we can as-\ncertain, that presents this property.\nExplainability, interpretability, and relevance are not uni-\nformly deﬁned in the literature [26]. For example, it is not\nclear if one would expect the resulting image to contain\nall of the pixels of the identiﬁed object, which would lead\nto better downstream tasks [21] and for favorable human\nimpressions, or to identify the sparse image locations that\ncause the predicted label to dominate. While some meth-\nods offer a clear theoretical framework [24], these rely on\nspeciﬁc assumptions and often do not lead to better perfor-\nmance on real data. Our approach is a mechanistic one\nand avoids controversial issues. Our goal is to improve\nthe performance on the acceptable benchmarks of the ﬁeld.\nThis goal is achieved on a diverse and complementary set\nof computer vision benchmarks, representing multiple ap-\nproaches to explainability.\nThese benchmarks include image segmentation on a sub-\nset of the ImageNet dataset, as well as positive and negative\nperturbations on the ImageNet validation set. In NLP, we\nconsider a public NLP explainability benchmark [10]. In\nthis benchmark, the task is to identify the excerpt that was\nmarked by humans as leading to a decision.\n2. Related Work\nExplainability in computer vision Many methods were\nsuggested for generating a heatmap that indicates local rel-\nevancy, given an input image and a CNN. Most of these\nmethods belong to one of two classes: gradient methods\nand attribution methods.\nGradient based methods are based on the gradients with\nrespect to the input of each layer, as computed through\nbackpropagation. The gradient is often multiplied by the in-\nput activations, which was ﬁrst done in the Gradient*Input\nmethod [34]. Integrated Gradients [39] also compute the\nmultiplication of the inputs with their derivatives. However,\nthis computation is done on the average gradient and a lin-\near interpolation of the input. SmoothGrad [36], visualizes\nthe mean gradients of the input, and performs smoothing by\nadding to the input image a random Gaussian noise at each\niteration. The FullGrad method [37] offers a more com-\nplete modeling of the gradient by also considering the gra-\ndient with respect to the bias term, and not just with respect\nto the input. We observe that these methods are all class-\nagnostic: at least in practice, similar outputs are obtained,\nregardless of the class used to compute the gradient that is\nbeing propagated.\nThe GradCAM method [32] is a class-speciﬁc approach,\nwhich combines both the input features and the gradients\nof a network’s layer. Being class-speciﬁc, and providing\nconsistent results, this method is used by downstream ap-\nplications, such as weakly-supervised semantic segmenta-\ntion [21]. However, the method’s computation is based only\non the gradients of the deepest layers. The result, obtained\nby upsampling these low-spatial resolution layers, is coarse.\nA second class of methods, the Attribution propaga-\ntion methods, are justiﬁed theoretically by the Deep Tay-\nlor Decomposition (DTD) framework [27]. Such methods\ndecompose, in a recursive manner, the decision made by\nthe network, into the contributions of the previous layers,\nall the way to the elements of the network’s input. The\nLayer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) method [2], prop-\nagates relevance from the predicated class, backward, to the\ninput image based on the DTD principle. This assumes\nthat the rectiﬁed linear unit (ReLU) non-linearity is used.\nSince Transformers typically rely on other types of applica-\ntions, our method has to apply DTD differently. Other vari-\nants of attribution methods include RAP [28], AGF [17],\nDeepLIFT [33], and DeepSHAP [24]. A disadvantage of\nsome of these methods is the class-agnostic behavior ob-\nserved in practice [20]. Class-speciﬁc behavior is obtained\nby Contrastive-LRP (CLRP) [15] and Softmax-Gradient-\nLRP (SGLRP) [20]. In both cases, the LRP propagation\nresults of the class to be visualized are contrasted with the\nresults of all other classes, to emphasize the differences and\nproduce a class-dependent heatmap. Our method is class-\nspeciﬁc by construction and not by adding additional con-\ntrasting stages.\nMethods that do not fall into these two main categories\ninclude saliency based methods [8, 35, 25, 48, 45, 47], Ac-\ntivation Maximization [12] and Excitation Backprop [46].\nPerturbation methods [13, 14] consider the change to the\ndecision of the network, as small changes are applied to the\ninput. Such methods are intuitive and applicable to black-\nbox models (no need to inspect either the activations or the\ngradients). However, the process of generating the heatmap\nis computationally expensive. In the context of Transform-\ners, it is not clear how to apply these correctly to discrete\ntokens, such as in text. Shapley-value methods [24] have a\nsolid theoretical justiﬁcation. However, such methods suf-\nfer from a large computational complexity and their accu-\nracy is often not as high as other methods. Several variants\nhave been proposed, which improve both aspects [5].\nExplainability for Transformers There are not many\ncontributions that explore the ﬁeld of visualization for\nTransformers and, as mentioned, many contributions em-\nploy the attention scores themselves. This practice ignores\n2\nmost of the attention components, as well as the parts of the\nnetworks that perform other types of computation. A self-\nattention head involves the computation of queries, keys,\nand values. Reducing it only to the obtained attention scores\n(inner products of queries and keys) is myopic. Other layers\nare not even considered. Our method, in contrast, propa-\ngates through all layers from the decision back to the input.\nLRP was applied for Transformers based on the premise\nthat considering mean attention heads is not optimal due to\ndifferent relevance of the attention heads in each layer [42].\nHowever, this was done in a limiting way, in which no rel-\nevance scores were propagated back to the input, thus pro-\nviding partial information on the relevance of each head.\nWe note that the relevancy scores were not directly evalu-\nated, only used for visualization of the relative importance\nand for pruning less relevant attention heads.\nThe main challenge in assigning attributions based on at-\ntentions is that attentions are combining non-linearly from\none layer to the next. The rollout method [1] assumes that\nattentions are combined linearly and considers paths along\nthe pairwise attention graph. We observe that this method\noften leads to an emphasis on irrelevant tokens since even\naverage attention scores can be attenuated. The method\nalso fails to distinguish between positive and negative con-\ntributions to the decision. Without such a distinction, one\ncan mix between the two and obtain high relevancy scores,\nwhen the contributions should have cancelled out. Despite\nthese shortcomings, the method was already applied by oth-\ners [11] to obtain integrated attention maps.\nAbnar et al. [1] present, in addition to rollout, a sec-\nond method called attention ﬂow. The latter considers the\nmax-ﬂow problem along the pair-wise attention graph. It\nis shown to be sometimes more correlated than the rollout\nmethod with relevance scores that are obtained by applying\nmasking, or with gradients with respect to the input. This\nmethod is much slower and we did not evaluate it in our\nexperiments for computational reasons.\nWe note this concurrent work [1] did not perform an\nevaluation on benchmarks (for either rollout or attention-\nﬂow) in which relevancy is assigned in a way that is in-\ndependent of the BERT [9] network, for which the methods\nwere employed. There was also no comparison to relevancy\nassignment methods, other than the raw attention scores.\n3. Method\nThe method employs LRP-based relevance to compute\nscores for each attention head in each layer of a Transformer\nmodel [41]. It then integrates these scores throughout the at-\ntention graph, by incorporating both relevancy and gradient\ninformation, in a way that iteratively removes the negative\ncontributions. The result is a class-speciﬁc visualization for\nself-attention models.\n3.1. Relevance and gradients\nLet C be the number of classes in the classiﬁcation head,\nand t ∈1 . . .|C|the class to be visualized. We propagate\nrelevance and gradients with respect to class t, which is not\nnecessarily the predicted class. Following literature con-\nvention, we denote x(n) as the input of layer L(n), where\nn ∈[1 . . . N] is the layer index in a network that consists of\nN layers, x(N) is the input to the network, and x(1) is the\noutput of the network.\nRecalling the chain-rule, we propagate gradients with re-\nspect to the classiﬁer’s outputy, at class t, namely yt:\n∇x(n)\nj := ∂yt\n∂x(n)\nj\n=\n∑\ni\n∂yt\n∂x(n−1)\ni\n∂x(n−1)\ni\n∂x(n)\nj\n(1)\nwhere the index j corresponds to elements in x(n), and i\ncorresponds to elements in x(n−1).\nWe denote by L(n)(X, Y) the layer’s operation on two\ntensors X and Y. Typically, the two tensors are the input\nfeature map and weights for layern. Relevance propagation\nfollows the generic Deep Taylor Decomposition [27]:\nR(n)\nj = G(X, Y, R(n−1)) (2)\n=\n∑\ni\nXj\n∂L(n)\ni (X, Y)\n∂Xj\nR(n−1)\ni\nL(n)\ni (X, Y)\n,\nwhere, similarly to Eq. 1, the index j corresponds to ele-\nments in R(n), and i corresponds to elements in R(n−1).\nEq. 2 satisﬁes the conservation rule [27], i.e.:\n∑\nj\nR(n)\nj =\n∑\ni\nR(n−1)\ni (3)\nLRP [2] assumes ReLU non-linearity activations, resulting\nin non-negative feature maps, where the relevance propaga-\ntion rule can be deﬁned as follows:\nR(n)\nj = G(x+, w+, R(n−1)) =\n∑\ni\nx+\nj w+\nji∑\nj′x+\nj′w+\nj′i\nR(n−1)\ni\n(4)\nwhere X = x and Y = w are the layer’s input and weights.\nThe superscript denotes the operation max(0, v) as v+.\nNon-linearities other that ReLU, such as GELU [18],\noutput both positive and negative values. To address this,\nLRP propagation in Eq. 4 can be modiﬁed by constructing\na subset of indices q = {(i, j)|xjwji ≥0}, resulting in the\nfollowing relevance propagation:\nR(n)\nj = Gq(x, w, q, R(n−1))\n=\n∑\n{i|(i,j)∈q}\nxjwji∑\n{j′|(j′,i)∈q}xj′wj′i\nR(n−1)\ni (5)\n3\nIn other words, we consider only the elements that have a\npositive weighed relevance.\nTo initialize the relevance propagation, we setR(0) = 1t,\nwhere 1t is a one-hot indicating the target class t.\n3.2. Non parametric relevance propagation:\nThere are two operators in Transformer models that in-\nvolve mixing of two feature map tensors (as opposed to a\nfeature map with a learned tensor): skip connections and\nmatrix multiplications (e.g. in attention modules). The two\noperators require the propagation of relevance through both\ninput tensors. Note that the two tensors may be of different\nshapes in the case of matrix multiplication.\nGiven two tensors u and v, we compute the relevance\npropagation of these binary operators ( i.e., operators that\nprocess two operands), as follows:\nRu(n)\nj = G(u, v, R(n−1)), R v(n)\nk = G(v, u, R(n−1)) (6)\nwhere Ru(n)\nj and Rv(n)\nk are the relevances for u and v re-\nspectively. These operations yield both positive and nega-\ntive values.\nThe following lemma shows that for the case of addition,\nthe conservation rule is preserved, i.e.,\n∑\nj\nRu(n)\nj +\n∑\nk\nRv(n)\nk =\n∑\ni\nR(n−1)\ni . (7)\nHowever, this is not the case for matrix multiplication.\nLemma 1. Given two tensors u and v, consider the rele-\nvances that are computed according to Eq. 1. Then, (i) if\nlayer L(n) adds the two tensors, i.e., L(n)(u, v) = u + v\nthen the conservation rule of Eq. 2 is maintained. (ii) if the\nlayer performs matrix multiplication L(n)(u, v) = uv, then\nEq. 2 does not hold in general.\nProof. (i) and (ii) are obtained from the output derivative of\nL(n) with respect to X. In an add layer, u and v are inde-\npendent of each other, while in matrix multiplication they\nare connected. A detailed proof of Lemma 3 is available in\nthe supplementary.\nWhen propagating relevance of skip connections, we en-\ncounter numerical instabilities. This arises despite the fact\nthat, by the conservation rule of the addition operator, the\nsum of relevance scores is constant. The underlying reason\nis that the relevance scores tend to obtain large absolute val-\nues, due to the way they are computed (Eq. 2). To see this,\nconsider the following example:\nu =\n(ea\neb\n)\n, v=\n(1 −ea\n1 −eb\n)\n, R =\n(1\n1\n)\n(8)\nRu =\n(\nea\nea−ea+1 1\neb\neb−eb+1 1\n)\n=\n(ea\neb\n)\n, R v =\n(1 −ea\n1 −eb\n)\n(9)\nwhere a and b are large positive numbers. It is easy to verify\nthat ∑Ru + ∑Rv = ea + 1 −ea + eb + 1 −eb = ∑R.\nAs can be seen, while the conservation rule is preserved, the\nrelevance scores of u and v may explode. See supplemen-\ntary for a step by step computation.\nTo address the lack of conservation in the attention\nmechanism due to matrix multiplication, and the numerical\nissues of the skip connections, our method applies a nor-\nmalization to Ru(n)\nj and Rv(n)\nk :\n¯Ru(n)\nj = Ru(n)\nj\n⏐⏐⏐∑\nj Ru(n)\nj\n⏐⏐⏐\n⏐⏐⏐∑\nj Ru(n)\nj\n⏐⏐⏐+\n⏐⏐⏐∑\nk Rv(n)\nk\n⏐⏐⏐\n·\n∑\ni R(n−1)\ni∑\nj Ru(n)\nj\n¯Rv(n)\nk = Rv(n)\nk\n⏐⏐⏐∑\nk Rv(n)\nk\n⏐⏐⏐\n⏐⏐⏐\n∑\nj Ru(n)\nj\n⏐⏐⏐+\n⏐⏐⏐\n∑\nk Rv(n)\nk\n⏐⏐⏐\n·\n∑\ni R(n−1)\ni∑\nk Rv(n)\nk\nFollowing the conservation rule (Eq. 3), and the initial\nrelevance, we obtain ∑\ni R(n)\ni = 1 for each layer n.\nThe following lemma presents the properties of the nor-\nmalized relevancy scores.\nLemma 2.

See supplementary.\n3.3. Relevance and gradient diffusion\nLet M be a Transformer model consisting of B blocks,\nwhere each block b is composed of self-attention, skip con-\nnections, and additional linear and normalization layers in\na certain assembly. The model takes as an input a sequence\nof s tokens, each of dimension d, with a special token for\nclassiﬁcation, commonly identiﬁed as the token [CLS]. M\noutputs a classiﬁcation probability vector y of length C,\ncomputed using the classiﬁcation token. The self-attention\nmodule operates on a small sub-space dh of the embedding\ndimension d, where h is the number of “heads”, such that\nhdh = d. The self-attention module is deﬁned as follows:\nA(b) = softmax(Q(b) ·K(b)T\n√dh\n) (11)\nO(b) = A(b) ·V(b) (12)\nwhere (·) denotes matrix multiplication, O(b) ∈Rh×s×dh\nis the output of the attention module in block b,\nQ(b), K(b), V(b) ∈Rh×s×dh are the query key and value\n4\ninputs in block b, namely, different projections of an input\nx(n) for a self-attention module. A(b) ∈Rh×s×s is the at-\ntention map of block b, where row i represents the attention\ncoefﬁcients of each token in the input with respect to the to-\nken i. The softmax in Eq. 11 is applied, such that the sum\nof each row in each attention head of A(b) is one.\nFollowing the propagation procedure of relevance and\ngradients, each attention map A(b) has its gradients ∇A(b),\nand relevance R(nb), with respect to a target class t, where\nnb is the layer that corresponds to the softmax operation\nin Eq. 11 of block b, and R(nb) is the layer’s relevance.\nThe ﬁnal output C ∈Rs×s of our method is then deﬁned\nby the weighted attention relevance:\n¯A(b) = I + Eh(∇A(b) ⊙R(nb))+ (13)\nC = ¯A(1) ·¯A(2) ·. . .·¯A(B) (14)\nwhere ⊙is the Hadamard product, and Eh is the mean\nacross the “heads” dimension. In order to compute the\nweighted attention relevance, we consider only the positive\nvalues of the gradients-relevance multiplication, resembling\npositive relevance. To account for the skip connections in\nthe Transformer block, we add the identity matrix to avoid\nself inhibition for each token.\nFor comparison, using the same notation, the rollout [1]\nmethod is given by:\nˆA(b) = I + EhA(b) (15)\nrollout = ˆA(1) ·ˆA(2) ·. . .·ˆA(B) (16)\nWe can observe that the result of rollout is ﬁxed given an\ninput sample, regardless of the target class to be visualized.\nIn addition, it does not consider any signal, except for the\npairwise attention scores.\n3.4. Obtaining the image relevance map\nThe resulting explanation of our method is a matrixC of\nsize s ×s, where s represents the sequence length of the in-\nput fed to the Transformer. Each row corresponds to a rele-\nvance map for each token given the other tokens - following\nthe attention computation convention in Eq. 14, 11. Since\nthis work focuses on classiﬁcation models, only the [CLS]\ntoken, which encapsulates the explanation of the classiﬁca-\ntion, is considered. The relevance map is, therefore, derived\nfrom the row C[CLS] ∈Rs that corresponds to the [CLS]\ntoken. This row contains a score evaluating each token’s\ninﬂuence on the classiﬁcation token.\nWe consider only the tokens that correspond to the ac-\ntual input, without special tokens, such as the [CLS] token\nand other separators. In vision models, such as ViT [11],\nthe content tokens represent image patches. To obtain the\nﬁnal relevance map, we reshape the sequence to the patches\ngrid size, e.g. for a square image, the patch grid size is√s −1 ×√s −1. This map is upsampled back to the size\nof the original image using bilinear interpolation.\nTransformer\nBlock Output\nGradients\nRelevance\nInput\nAttetion\nTransformer\nBlock\nFigure 1: Illustration of our method. Gradients and relevan-\ncies are propagated through the network, and integrated to\nproduce the ﬁnal relevancy maps, as described in Eq. 13, 14.\n4. Experiments\nFor the linguistic classiﬁcation task, we experiment with\nthe BERT-base [9] model as our classiﬁer, assuming a max-\nimum of 512 tokens, and a classiﬁcation token [CLS] that\nis used as the input to the classiﬁcation head.\nFor the visual classiﬁcation task, we experiment with the\npretrained ViT-base [11] model, which consists of a BERT-\nlike model. The input is a sequence of all non-overlapping\npatches of size 16 ×16 of the input image, followed by ﬂat-\ntening and linear layers, to produce a sequence of vectors.\nSimilar to BERT, a classiﬁcation token[CLS] is appended\nat the beginning of the sequence and used for classiﬁcation.\nThe baselines are divided into three classes: attention-\nmaps, relevance, and gradient-based methods. Each has dif-\nferent properties and assumptions over the architecture and\npropagation of information in the network. To best reﬂect\nthe performance of different baselines, we focus on methods\nthat are both common in the explainability literature, and\napplicable to the extensive tests we report in this section,\ne.g. Black-box methods, such as Perturbation and Shapely\nbased methods, are computationally too expensive and in-\nherently different from the proposed method. We brieﬂy\ndescribe each baseline in the following section and the dif-\nferent experiments for each domain.\nThe attention-map baselines include rollout [1], follow-\ning Eq. 16, which produces an explanation that takes into\naccount all the attention-maps computed along the forward-\npass. A more straightforward method is raw attention, i.e.\nusing the attention map of block 1 to extract the relevance\nscores. These methods are class-agnostic by deﬁnition.\nUnlike attention-map based methods, the relevance prop-\nagation methods consider the information ﬂow through the\nentire network, and not just the attention maps. These base-\nlines include Eq. 4 and the partial application of LRP that\nfollows [42]. As we show in our experiments, the different\nvariants of the LRP method are practically class-agnostic,\nmeaning the visualization remains approximately the same\nfor different target classes.\nA common class-speciﬁc explanation method is Grad-\nCAM [32], which computes a weighted gradient-feature-\nmap to the last convolution layer in a CNN model. The best\n5\nway we found to apply GradCAM was to treat the last at-\ntention layer’s[CLS] token as the designated feature map,\nwithout considering the [CLS] token itself. We note that\nthe last output of a Transformer model (before the classiﬁ-\ncation head), is a tensorv ∈Rs×d, where the ﬁrst dimension\nrelates to different input tokens, and only the [CLS] token\nis fed to the classiﬁcation head. Thus, performing Grad-\nCAM on v will impose a sparse gradients tensor ∇v, with\nzeros for all tokens, except [CLS].\nEvaluation settings For the visual domain, we follow\nthe convention of reporting results for negative and pos-\nitive perturbations, as well as showing results for seg-\nmentation, which can be seen as a general case of ”The\nPointing-Game” [19]. The dataset used is the validation\nset of ImageNet [31] (ILSVRC) 2012, consisting of 50K\nimages from 1000 classes, and an annotated subset of\nImageNet called ImageNet-Segmentation [16], containing\n4,276 images from 445 categories. For the linguistic do-\nmain, we follow ERASER [10] and evaluate the reason-\ning for the Movies Reviews [44] dataset, which consists of\n1600/200/200 reviews for train/val/test. This task is a binary\nsentiment analysis task. Providing explanations for ques-\ntion answering and entailment tasks of the other datasets in\nERASER, which require input sizes of more than 512 to-\nkens (the limit of our BERT model), is left for future work.\nThe positive and negative perturbation tests follow a two-\nstage setting. First, a pre-trained network is used for ex-\ntracting visualizations for the validation set of ImageNet.\nSecond, we gradually mask out the pixels of the input im-\nage and measure the mean top-1 accuracy of the network.\nIn positive perturbation, pixels are masked from the high-\nest relevance to the lowest, while in the negative version,\nfrom lowest to highest. In positive perturbation, one ex-\npects to see a steep decrease in performance, which indi-\ncates that the masked pixels are important to the classiﬁ-\ncation score. In negative perturbation, a good explanation\nwould maintain the accuracy of the model, while remov-\ning pixels that are not related to the class. In both cases,\nwe measure the area-under-the-curve (AUC), for erasing be-\ntween 10% −90% of the pixels.\nThe two tests can be applied to the predicted or the\nground-truth class. Class-speciﬁc methods are expected to\ngain performance in the latter case, while class-agnostic\nmethods would present similar performance in both tests.\nThe segmentation tests consider each visualization as\na soft-segmentation of the image, and compare it to the\nground truth segmentation of the ImageNet-Segmentation\ndataset. Performance is measured by (i) pixel-accuracy,\nobtained after thresholding each visualization by the\nmean value, (ii) mean-intersection-over-union (mIoU), and\n(iii) mean-Average-Precision (mAP), which uses the soft-\nsegmentation to obtain a score that is threshold-agnostic.\nThe NLP benchmark follows the evaluation setting of\nERASER [10] for rationales extraction, where the goal is\nto extract parts of the input that support the (ground truth)\nclassiﬁcation. The BERT model is ﬁrst ﬁne-tuned on the\ntraining set of the Movie Reviews Dataset and the various\nevaluation methods are applied to its results on the test set.\nWe report the token-F1 score, which is best suited for per-\ntoken explanation (in contrast to explanations that extract an\nexcerpt). To best illustrate the performance of each method,\nwe consider a token to be part of the “rationale” if it is part\nof the top-k tokens, and show results for k = 10 . . .80 in\nsteps of 10 tokens. This way, we do not employ threshold-\ning that may beneﬁt some methods over others.\n4.1. Results\nQualitative evaluationFig.2 presents a visual comparison\nbetween our method and the various baselines. As can\nbe seen, the baseline methods produce inconsistent perfor-\nmance, while our method results in a much clearer and con-\nsistent visualization.\nIn order to show that our method is class-speciﬁc, we\nshow in Fig. 3 images with two objects, each from a dif-\nferent class. As can be seen, all methods, except Grad-\nCAM, produce similar visualization for each class, while\nour method provides two different and accurate visualiza-\ntions.\nPerturbation tests Tab. 1 presents the AUC obtained for\nboth negative and positive perturbation tests, for both the\npredicted and the target class. As can be seen, our method\nachieves better performance by a large margin in both tests.\nNotice that because rollout and raw attention produce con-\nstant visualization given an input image, we omit their\nscores in the target-class test.\nSegmentation The segmentation metrics (pixel-accuracy,\nmAP, and mIoU) on ImageNet-segmentation are shown in\nTab. 2. As can be seen, our method outperforms all base-\nlines by a signiﬁcant margin.\nLanguage reasoningFig. 4 depicts the performance on the\nMovie Reviews “rationales” experiment, evaluating for top-\nK tokens, ranging from 10 to 80. As can be seen, while\nall methods beneﬁt from increasing the amount tokens, our\nmethod consistently outperforms the baselines. See supple-\nmentary for a depiction of the obtained visualization.\nAblation study.We consider three variants of our method\nand present their performance on the segmentation and pre-\ndicted class perturbation experiments. (i) Ours w/o ∇A(b),\nwhich modiﬁes Eq. 13 s.t. we use A(b) instead of ∇A(b),\n(ii) ∇A(1)R(n1), i.e. disregarding rollout in Eq. 14, and us-\ning our method only on block 1, which is the block closest\nto the output, and (iii) ∇A(B−1)R(nB−1) which similar to\n(ii), only for block B −1 which is closer to the input.\nAs can be seen in Tab. 3 the ablation ∇A(1)R(n1) in\nwhich one removes the rollout component, i.e., Eq. 14,\n6\nInput rollout [1] raw-attention GradCAM [32] LRP [3] partial LRP [42] Ours\nFigure 2: Sample results.

Out of the two single block vi-\nsualizations ((ii), and (iii)), the combined attention gradient\nand relevancy at the b = 1 block, which is the closest to\nthe output, is more informative than the block closest to the\ninput. This is the same block that is being used for the raw-\nattention, partial LRP, and the GradCAM methods. The\nablation that considers only this block outperforms these\nmethods, indicating that the advantage of our method stems\nmostly from the combination of relevancy as we compute it\nand attention-map gradients.\n5. Conclusions\nThe self-attention mechanism links each of the tokens to\nthe [CLS] token. The strength of this attention link can\nbe intuitively considered as an indicator of the contribution\nof each token to the classiﬁcation. While this is intuitive,\ngiven the term “attention”, the attention values reﬂect only\none aspect of the Transformer network or even of the self-\nattention head. As we demonstrate, both when using a ﬁne-\ntuned BERT model for NLP and with the ViT model, atten-\ntions lead to fragmented and non-competitive explanations.\nDespite this shortcoming and the importance of Trans-\nformer models, the literature with regards to interpretability\nof Transformers is sparse. In comparison to CNNs, multiple\nfactors prevent methods developed for other forms of neu-\nral networks (not including the slower black-box methods)\nfrom being applied. These include the use of non-positive\nactivation functions, the frequent use of skip connections,\nand the challenge of modeling the matrix multiplication that\nis used in self-attention.\nOur method provides speciﬁc solutions to each of these\nchallenges and obtains state-of-the-art results when com-\npared to the methods of the Transformer literature, the LRP\nmethod, and the GradCam method, which can be applied\ndirectly to Transformers.\nAcknowledgment\nThis project has received funding from the European Re-\nsearch Council (ERC) under the European Unions Horizon\n2020 research and innovation programme (grant ERC CoG\n725974).

Details of the various Baselines\nGradCAM As mentioned in Sec. 4, we consider the last attention layer (closest to the output) - namely A(1). This results\nin a feature-map of size h×s×s. Following the process described in Sec. 3.4, we take only the[CLS] token’s row (without\nthe [CLS] token’s column), and reshape to the patches grid size hp ×wp. This results in a feature-map similar to the 2D\nfeature-map used for GradCAM, where the number of channels, in this case, is h, and the height and width are hp and wp.\nThe reason we use the last attention layer is because of the sparse gradients issue described in Sec. 4.\nraw-attention The raw-attention method visualizes the last attention layer (closest to the output) - namelyA(1). It follows\nthe process described in Sec. 3.4 to extract the ﬁnal output.\nLRP In this method, we propagate relevance up to the input image, following the propagation rules of LRP (not our\nmodiﬁed rules and normalizations).\npartial-LRP Following [42], we visualize an intermediate relevance map, more speciﬁcally, we visualize the last attention-\nmap’s relevance, namelyR(n1), using LRP propagation rules.\nrollout We follow Eq. 16.\n11\nB. Proofs for Lemmas\nGiven two tensors u and v, we compute the relevance propagation of binary operators ( i.e., operators that process two\noperands) as follows:\nRu(n)\nj = G(u, v, R(n−1))\nRv(n)\nk = G(v, u, R(n−1)) (1)\nwhere Ru(n)\nj and Rv(n)\nk are the relevances for u and v respectively.\nThe following lemma shows that for the case of addition, the conservation rule is preserved, i.e.,\n∑\nj\nRu(n)\nj +\n∑\nk\nRv(n)\nk =\n∑\ni\nR(n−1)\ni . (2)\nHowever, this is not the case for matrix multiplication.\nLemma 3. Given two tensors u and v, consider the relevances that are computed according to Eq. 1. Then, (i) if layer L(n)\nadds the two tensors, i.e., L(n)(u, v) = u + v then the conservation rule of Eq. 2 is maintained. (ii) if the layer performs\nmatrix multiplication L(n)(u, v) = uv, then Eq. 2 does not hold in general.\nProof. For part (i), we note that the number of elements in u equals the number of elements in v, therefore k = j, and we\ncan write Eq. 2 following the deﬁnition of G:\n∑\nj\n∑\ni\nuj\n∂(ui + vi)\n∂uj\nR(n−1)\ni\nui + vi\n+\n∑\nj\n∑\ni\nvj\n∂(ui + vi)\n∂vj\nR(n−1)\ni\nui + vi\n=\n∑\nj\nuj\nuj + vj\nR(n−1)\nj +\n∑\nj\nvj\nuj + vj\nR(n−1)\nj\n=\n∑\nj\nuj + vj\nuj + vj\nR(n−1)\nj =\n∑\nj\nR(n−1)\nj (3)\nnote that, in this case, it is possible that ∑\nj Ru(n)\nj ̸= ∑\nj Rv(n)\nj .\nAs shown in the main text, while the sum of two tensors maintains the conservation rule, their values may explode.\nConsider u =\n(ea\neb\n)\n, v =\n(1 −ea\n1 −eb\n)\nand R =\n(1\n1\n)\n, following the deﬁnition of Gwe have:\nRu(n)\nj =\n∑\ni\nuj\n∂(ui + vi)\n∂uj\nR(n−1)\ni\nui + vi\n= uj\nuj + vj\nR(n−1)\nj , R v(n)\nj = vj\nuj + vj\nR(n−1)\nj\nRu =\n(\nea\nea−ea+1 1\neb\neb−eb+1 1\n)\n=\n(ea\neb\n)\n, R v =\n(1 −ea\n1 −eb\n)\n(4)\nwhich causes numerical instability.\nFor part (ii), in the case of matrix multiplication between u and v, where u ∈ Rk,m, v ∈ Rm,l, we will show that:\n12\n∑\nk\n∑\nm Ru(n)\nk,m = ∑\nm\n∑\nl Rv(n)\nm,l = ∑\nl\n∑\nk R(n−1)\nk,l , which invalidates the conservation rule:\nRu(n)\nk,m =\n∑\nl\nuk,m\n∂(uv)k,l\n∂uk,m\nR(n−1)\nk,l∑\nm′uk,m′vm′l\n=\n∑\nl\nuk,mvm,l∑\nm′uk,m′vm′l\nR(n−1)\nk,l (5)\nRv(n)\nm,l =\n∑\nk\nvm,l\n∂(uv)k,l\n∂vm,l\nR(n−1)\nk,l∑\nm′uk,m′vm′l\n=\n∑\nk\nuk,mvm,l∑\nm′uk,m′vm′l\nR(n−1)\nk,l (6)\n∑\nk\n∑\nm\nRu(n)\nk,m +\n∑\nm\n∑\nl\nRv(n)\nm,l =\n∑\nk\n∑\nm\n∑\nl\nuk,mvm,l∑\nm′uk,m′vm′l\nR(n−1)\nk,l +\n∑\nm\n∑\nl\n∑\nk\nuk,mvm,l∑\nm′uk,m′vm′l\nR(n−1)\nk,l\n=\n∑\nk\n∑\nl\n∑\nm uk,mvm,l∑\nm′uk,m′vm′l\nR(n−1)\nk,l +\n∑\nl\n∑\nk\n∑\nm uk,mvm,l∑\nm′uk,m′vm′l\nR(n−1)\nk,l (7)\n= 2\n∑\nl\n∑\nk\nR(n−1)\nk,l (8)\nTo address the lack of conservation in the attention mechanism, which employs multiplication, and the numerical issues\nof the skip connections, our method applies a normalization to Ru(n)\nj and Rv(n)\nk :\n¯Ru(n)\nj = Ru(n)\nj\n⏐⏐⏐∑\nj Ru(n)\nj\n⏐⏐⏐\n⏐⏐⏐∑\nj Ru(n)\nj\n⏐⏐⏐+\n⏐⏐⏐∑\nk Rv(n)\nk\n⏐⏐⏐\n·\n∑\ni R(n−1)\ni∑\nj Ru(n)\nj\n¯Rv(n)\nk = Rv(n)\nk\n⏐⏐⏐∑\nk Rv(n)\nk\n⏐⏐⏐\n⏐⏐⏐∑\nj Ru(n)\nj\n⏐⏐⏐+\n⏐⏐⏐∑\nk Rv(n)\nk\n⏐⏐⏐\n·\n∑\ni R(n−1)\ni∑\nk Rv(n)\nk\n(9)\nLemma 4.

Visualizations - Text\nIn the following visualizations, we use the TAHV heatmap generator for text ( https://github.com/jiesutd/\nText-Attention-Heatmap-Visualization ) to present the relevancy scores for each method, as well as the ex-\ncerpts marked by humans. For methods that are class-dependent, we present the attributions obtained both for the ground\ntruth class and the counter-factual class.\nEvidently, our method is the only one that is able to present support for both sides, see panels (b,c) of each image.\nGradCAM often suffers from highlighting the evidence in the opposite direction (sign reversal), e.g., Fig. 13(g), in which the\ncounter-factual explanation of GradCAM supports the negative, ground truth, sentiment and not the positive one.\nPartial LRP (panels d,e) is not class-speciﬁc in practice. This provides it with an advantage in the quantitative experiments:\nPartial LRP highlights words with both positive and negative connotations from the same sentence, which better matches the\nbehavior of the human annotators who are asked to mark complete sentences.\nNotice that in most visualizations, it seems that the rollout method focuses mostly on the separation token [SEP], and fails\nto generate meaningful visualizations. This corresponds to the results presented in the quantitative experiments.\nIt seems from our results, e.g., Fig. 13(b,c) that the BERT tokenizer leads to unintuitive results. For example, “joyless” is\nbroken down into “joy” and “less”, each supporting different sides of the decision.\n27\nthere may not be a critic alive who harbors as much aﬀection for shlock monster movies\nas i do . i delighted in the sneaky - smart entertainment of ron underwood ’s big -\nunderground - worm yarn tremors ;
