(b) Interface used\nfor our User Study: Example showing the three questions for Legibility in Fetch Domain.\nhumans in human-like manner, processes and behaviors. A vital\ncomponent of such interaction is the Theory of Mind (ToM), which\ninvolves attributing mental states – such as beliefs, intentions, de-\nsires, and emotions – to oneself and others, and to understand that\nthese mental states may differ from one’s own. ToM has exten-\nsive roots in Human-Human interaction and has motivated several\ncritical studies in pursuit of social intelligence [2, 3, 15, 60]. More-\nover, ToM is the corner stone enabling effective communication,\ncollaboration, or deception and becomes a pre-requisite for most of\nhuman-agent interaction [12, 20, 29, 43, 57]. Everyday interactions\nwhich are second nature to human conversations like our ability to\nempathize with a character in a movie or understand social humor\nis in part due to our ability to perform theory of mind and comes\nnaturally to humans [41].\nTheory of Mind becomes all the more important in Human-Robot\nInteraction to facilitate improved behavior synthesis [8, 9, 11, 26–\n28, 47, 48, 69] and engender Human-Robot trust [14, 65–68]. Prior\nworks have either assumed a human mental model [9] or learned\nit through interaction [56, 69]. Recent developments in generative\nAI, specifically LLMs may have opened a new way to access ap-\nproximate human mental model to enable robots achieve their HRI\nobjectives in better ways through symbolic [49] or other modalities\n[16, 55, 56]. Initial research hinted at emergent LLM’s Reasoning,\nPlanning & Theory of Mind abilities [6, 21, 30, 46], however, recent\nworks have refuted such claims [44, 52, 54]. While LLMs may not be\nsound reasoners or perform ToM as humans do, their performance\non existing benchmarks for such tasks certainly exceeds chance\nbehavior and it may find significant use as a Human-Proxy avail-\nable to the robot. Sally-Anne test and its variations that have been\nextensively studied for testing ToM have likely been seen in the\ntraining data for these LLMs. We suspect that LLM’s approximate\nretrieval is be mistaken for reasoning abilities. If LLMs were indeed\ngood at Theory of Mind, then, as in Fig. 2a, a robot can leverage the\nLLM to perform an internal critique while synthesizing behavior\nwith a human-in-the-loop. The internal critique essentially would\nanswer whether the planned robot behavior would be useful for the\nhuman-in-the-loop. For instance, if the human prefers explicable\nbehavior [69], the robot can query the LLM to check whether a\nplanned behavior would indeed be explicable to the human.\nWhile past works checking for emergent abilities of LLM [6, 21,\n30, 46], even ToM abilities [24] exist, we posit that there is a need for\ninvestigating scenarios specific to HRI as real-world robots function\nin a non-ergodic world with irreversible consequences and much\nhigher stakes. To this end, we investigate PROBE task (Perceived\nRObot Bhavior rEcognition) as a means to understand theory of\nmind abilities of Large Language Models in the context of Human-\nRobot Interaction. For example, the Fetch robot that is navigating\nto a location with a human observer in the loop has to tuck its\narms and crouch before moving1. The lay-observer unfamiliar with\nthe underlying dynamics of the robot may find the actions \"tuck\n& crouch\" unnecessary and inexplicable. In our investigation, the\nrobot employs an LLM to ask the test question \"Given behavior X,\nwould the human observer find such a plan explicable?\".\nWe study four robot behaviors which have been extensively\ndiscussed in HRI and mental modelling, namely - explicable, legi-\nble, predictable and obfuscatory behavior (referred to as “behavior\ntypes\"). We leverage the rich literature along these behavior types\nand borrow five domains used in prior works and valuable to the\nHRI community, namely - Fetch, Passage Gridworld, Environment\nDesign, Urban Search and Rescue, and Package Delivery. For each\ndomain we construct four distinct situations corresponding to each\nbehavior type. We construct a prompt (can be automated) using\nrelevant context like description of the domain, robot capabilities\n& goals, and a definition of the behavior type. The LLM is asked a\nbinary question (Q1) on whether the human observer would find\nthe agent plan to be explicable (or the corresponding behavior type)\nand a multi choice question (Q2). In our evaluation, upon correct\nanswer to (Q1), the LLM is tasked with choosing one explanation\nfrom a set of options, explaining why the plan conforms to the\npredicted behavior type (Q2). As a baseline, we first test LLM on\nvanilla prompts : success on which is indicative of potential ToM\nabilities but may also inflate one’s expectations of LLMs. Second, we\npropose three tests of which two are perturbation tests as Inconsis-\ntent Belief and Uninformative Context, and a Conviction Test. Our\nsecond suite of tests elicit important conclusions on ToM abilities\nof LLMs and essentially break the supposed illusion.\nWe highlight our contributions as follows :\n1. We conduct a first study of Theory of Mind abilities of Large\nLanguage Models in the context of interpretable behavior synthesis\nand Human-Robot Interaction.\n1Project Link & Supplementary : https://famishedrover.github.io/papers/llm-probe/\nindex.html\nToM abilities of LLMs in HRI : An Illusion? HRI ’24 Companion, March 11–14, 2024, Boulder, CO, USA\n2. We investigate along five domains and four behavior types\nwhich have been well motivated with respect to the need for mental\nmodeling in HRI and curate a total of 20 situations.\n3. We perform a user subject study to validate our curated situa-\ntions as lay users are able to correctly answer ToM queries.\n4. We propose second-order tests including two perturbation\ntests and the Conviction test which highlights that any ToM abilities\nof LLMs are illusionary.\n5. We perform a user subject study to validate that humans\nobservers observing a real robot (Fetch) will be unaffected by per-\nturbations while answering ToM queries.\n2 RELATED WORK\nLarge Language Models : Large Language Models [70] are pre-\ntrained generative AI models that can take a piece of text as an\ninput and generate text as an output. Typically, the input space\nis unconstrained, meaning a finite yet large set of tokens / text is\na valid input for the GPT like Large Language Model. While this\nallows for arbitrary tasks to be framed as a linguistic query for\nthe LLM, it is unclear whether data-driven next-word prediction\nstyle of LLMs [1, 13, 37, 62] training is reason enough to believe\nthat LLMs would perform well on said arbitrary tasks. Over the\npast years several variants and versions of Large Language Models\nhave been released such as the GPT family [ 37], LLAMA family\n[51], PALM family [1, 13], BLOOM [62] and several others [70]. In\nthis work we conduct our study with GPT-4 [37] as it is one of the\nstrongest LLMs in terms of NLP task performance.\nTheory of Mind: Theory of Mind has been a challenging, yet,\never-interesting topic for researchers [17, 33, 53, 64]. It allows for\neffective communication between agents especially with a human\nin the loop. While humans develop it naturally, ToM is considered\nto be one of the most challenging goals for an AI agent [41]. In this\nwork, we are specifically interested in studying ToM for human-\nrobot interaction for behavior synthesis that involves extensive\nmodeling of the human in the loop, reasoning on those models and\nsynthesise behavior that conforms to the human mental models.\nLLMs, Theory of Mind and Emergent abilities: LLMs have\namassed a large popularity with public and the research community\nwith its exceptional abilities in NLP tasks. With an AI as impressive\nas an LLM, researchers have explored the possibilities of emergent\nabilities of these LLMs. While this is an active area of research,\nof interest to the scope of this work are LLMs abilities in reason-\ning [23, 58, 59], deception abilities [18], Theory of Mind abilities\n[25] and other emergent behaviors that are similar to human be-\nhaviors [7, 40, 42, 50, 63]. While these works highlight how LLMs\npossess these abilities, more recent works have refuted these claims\n[5, 22, 35, 45, 52, 54] citing that LLMs are extremely brittle and\nheavilty depend on the prompt fed to it. [ 54] suggests, systems\nthat reason do not have to depend upon such syntactic alterations\nto the input like Chain of Thought Prompts, Tree of Thoughts or\nother prompting strategies [ 31]. While ToM has extensive prior\nworks on specialized robot agents [4, 34, 39] these works are not\ndirectly applicable to investigating the emergent ToM abilities of\nLLMs. We distinguish ourselves from past works through our novel\nconstruction of prompt situations which are sourced from the vast\nliterature on behavior synthesis, the situations are well rooted for\nHRI scenarios, provide a thorough analysis via a large-scale user\nsubject study and provide a case study with real Fetch robot in HRI.\n3 PRELIMINARIES\nA core focus of this work is to analyze the Theory of Mind abilities\nof Large Language models in Human-AI interaction scenario. As\nmotivated previously, we identify that Human-Aware Planning is an\nimportant part of HRI that attempts to synthesize agent behaviors\nby taking human mental model into account. [9, 48] provides a good\noverview of the literature and formal specifications of behavior\ntypes we consider in this work. [9, 26] papers reconciles the various\ninterpretations of terminologies used in the literature and highlights\nimportant connections between related works. Subsequently, they\nprovide formal definitions of the four behavior types (explicability,\npredictability, legibility and obfuscation) as follows :\n(1) Explicability [10, 47, 69]: Explicability measures how close a\nplan is to the expectations of the observer, given a known\ngoal.\n(2) Legibility : Plan legibility reduces ambiguity over possible\ngoals that are being achieved.\n(3) Predictability : Plan predictability reduces ambiguity over\npossible plans, given a goal.\n(4) Obfuscation (Goal-Obfuscation) [26] : A plan is an obfusca-\ntory behavior if it k-ambiguous. That is, the plan is consistent\nwith at least 𝑘 goals with a true goal of the agent and 𝑘−1\nare decoy goals meant to deceive the human observer.\nEach of these behavior types correspond to utilize the human men-\ntal model to synthesize a behavior to achieve some target. For\nexample, explicability utilizes the human mental model and forces\nthe robot to conform to the human model. Not only the robot must\nrealize which behavior type it should conform to (even though\nthese types are not mutually exclusive, they can be competing as\npointed by [9]), but also inherently require the human’s mental\nmodel. Further, it needs to be able to reason with the human mental\nmodel to finally synthesize the expected behavior. This shows that\nbehavior synthesis not only requires Theory of Mind abilities but\nalso require reasoning abilities (i.e. performing inference over the\nmental models). There exists a large body of work that study the\nvariations among and behavior types but we argue that showcasing\nLLM’s failure at ToM on these canonical types is sufficient (as prob-\nlems studying a cross between behavior types require the agent to\noptimize over multiple, possibly competing, objectives).\n4 METHODOLOGY\nThrough this work, we answer the following three questions in the\ncontext of mental-model reasoning abilities in Human-AI Interac-\ntion scenarios for behavior synthesis :\nResearch Question 1: How do human subjects 2 perform on ToM\nreasoning tasks in Human-Robot Interaction scenarios?\nResearch Question 2: How much does LLM performance align\nwith that of: 1) oracle, & 2) human subjects?\nResearch Question 3: How robust are LLMs in their (perceived)\nmental-model reasoning abilities?\n2We refer to lay users as human subjects in the rest of the paper.\nHRI ’24 Companion, March 11–14, 2024, Boulder, CO, USA Mudit Verma, Siddhant Bhambri, and Subbarao Kambhampati\nWe first construct a set of ToM tasks given as \"situations\" across\nfive domains. A situation is described as an ordered tuple S =\n(𝑅𝑑,𝐺,𝐵 𝑑,𝐶,𝑃 )where 𝑅𝑑 is the description of the domain, robot\ncapabilities and actions. 𝐺 is the description of goals, 𝐵𝑑 describes\nthe behavior-type, 𝐶 describes any additional constraints (like par-\ntial observability) and 𝑃 is optional and adds a perturbation text\n(Uninformative Context or Inconsistent Belief). Following each sit-\nuation we query two questions, Q1 : a binary yes/no question on\nwhether the human observer perceives the agent behavior accord-\ning to a behavior-type, and Q2 : to select an explanation for why\nthe said behavior-type is a valid answer. A prompt is composed of\nthe tuple and the two questions. We first validate our constructed\nprompts and obtain human baseline performance. We then query\nthe prompts to GPT-X family, i.e. GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo. We\nnote that queries to GPT-X family imply an expectation of second\norder ToM abilities which implies we expect the LLM to \"think what\nthe ’human would think of the robot’s behavior’\". As discussed in\nSection 1, such an ability can be leveraged by the robot to use LLMs\nas a human-proxy and improve its behavior synthesis process.\nAs discussed in Sec. 6, the performance of LLMs on the vanilla\nprompts (where 𝑃 = ∅) engenders an inflated belief that LLMs\nmay possess ToM abilities. We then investigate the robustness of\nLLM responses with two perturbation cases and a Conviction test.\nUnlike how ToM agents (like humans) behave [2, 3, 15, 52, 60](see\nSec. 7), we find that LLMs are extremely brittle to small changes\nto prompt and fail miserably. Finally, we present a case study with\nFetch robot where a human observes the robot acting in the world\nalong the three cases Vanilla prompt, Uninformative Context and\nInconsistent Belief. For all our experiments we use the most recent\nversion of GPT-4 (as of September 30, 2023) and GPT-3.5-turbo\n(as of November 25, 2023). Past works have justified their general\nsuperiority amongst the popular LLMs and within the GPT-X family\n[37] motivating their use as representative LLMs.\n4.1 Prompt Construction\nFor each domain we create four situations corresponding to each\nbehavior-type. In each situation there is a robot acting in the world\nand a human observer. Based on the human’s mental model they\nmay find the robot behavior to be explicable, legible, predictable\nor obfuscatory. We write one prompt for each situation (i.e. Do-\nmain ×Behavior-Type). The prompt is divided into sections as :\na description of the robot, its actions, the goal, definition of the\nbehavior type we wish to have the LLM answer about, and the plan\nproposed / executed by the robot. Following which we add our ToM\ntest question (Q1) whether the plan corresponds to the behavior\ntype (as a binary answer) and (Q2) the reason for the answer to Q1.\n4.2 Human Subject Study on ToM-PROBE task\nIn reference to answering research question 1, we describe our\nuser study for evaluating the alignment between LLM and human\nresponses. We evaluate four agent behaviors, namely - explicabil-\nity, legibility, predictability and obfuscation, across five domains\ndiscussed in detail in Section 5. The study protocol was approved\nby our local Institutional Review Board (IRB) and refined through\npilot studies over a small group of participants.\nTable 1: Study-1 Participant Demographics by Test Domain.\nTest Domain N #Male #Female #Other Avg.

For answering RQ2, we designed the first\nquestion as a binary Yes/No response on the agent behavior con-\nforming to the given behavior type. The second question was a\nMultiple Choice Question (MCQ) asking the participants to choose\nthe correct reason behind the agent behavior. In Q3, we presented\nthe participants with GPT-4’s response when given the same prompt\ncomprising of the domain description and the first question (see,\nvignettes in Supplementary). For the last question, participants an-\nswered on a Likert Scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree ) to 5 (Strongly\nAgree) with the LLM’s reasoning on the agent behavior. Our study\nhad a mixed design: Test Domains were varied between-subjects,\nand response ordering was varied within-subjects for the first two\nquestions.\n4.2.2 Setup & Procedure. The study used the Prolific platform [38],\ndirecting participants to a Google Form for responses. Participants\ncould use any device without requiring speaker, camera, micro-\nphone, or special software for the study. First, they were presented\nwith the data confidentiality statement, followed questions collect-\ning their demographic details, and finally provided with the instruc-\ntions and overview of the entire study which consisted of the four\nparts comprising three questions each. The study approximately\ntook 6 minutes to complete, and participants were compensated at\nthe rate of $9/hour.\n4.2.3 Participants. We recruited 125 participants (between the ages\nof 18 and 60). We conducted a pilot study on 25 participants spread\nacross each of the five evaluation domains. The final study, refined\nusing the pilot study responses, had a sample size of 100 participants\nwith 20 participants for each of the five domains listed in Section\n5 (see Table 1). Most participants fell in the age range of 21 to 34\nyears, and had an undergraduate degree. Participants reported a\nmean familiarity of 3.07 and standard deviation of 0.36 to Machine\nLearning and Artificial Intelligence tools/technologies, on a 7-point\nLikert Scale with 1 corresponding to being least familiar.\n4.3 Testing LLMs for Robustness\nTo answer research question 3, we design a set of adversarial per-\nturbation strategies for testing the robustness of LLM responses in\nmental-model reasoning tasks. As pointed by [52], mental-model\nreasoning should be unaffected by perturbations, commonly re-\nferred to as deception strategies in cognitive development studies\n[19, 32, 61]. In the case of LLMs where the said reasoning tasks are\npresented as text prompts, we design the following perturbation\nstrategies (see 1 and 2 for example prompts), ensuring that the final\nexpected reasoning responses are invariant to the perturbations\nintroduced by each of the two cases:\nToM abilities of LLMs in HRI : An Illusion? HRI ’24 Companion, March 11–14, 2024, Boulder, CO, USA\nFigure 3: An illustrative view of the domains used for testing LLM for Theory of Mind reasoning on the Perceived Behavior\nRecognition task. Left to Right: Fetch Robot Domain, Passage Gridworld, Environment Design, Urban Search and Rescue, and\nPackage Delivery.\nPerturb 1: Fetch - Legibility + Uninformative Context\nDescription: Fetch is a robot that can carry objects from one location to another. There\nare three locations: loc1, loc2, and loc3 where the robot can go.\nThere is a block b1 at location loc1, and the robot is at location loc1 and has its hand\nempty. Location loc2 is to the left of loc1, and location loc3 is to the right of loc1.\nGoals: The robot has to take the block b1 to either loc2 OR loc3 (only one of these\nlocations).\nDefinition : A partial plan is a part of robot’s behavior, for example a few actions that\nit takes.\nDefinition : A partial plan is legible if the observer (you) can identify which goal the\nrobot wants to go for. A partial plan A is more legible than another partial plan B if the\nnumber of possible goal locations for A is less than B.\nPlan : In the robot’s partial plan, it picks block b1 and takes one step left.\nThe robot has a label saying ’Not a Legible Agent’. The human observer cannot read.\nThe human observer looks at the label. The human observer has not seen the robot\nbefore.\nQuestion 1 : Imagine you are the human observer. Would you find such a partial plan\nlegible? Give your answer as ’Yes’ or ’No’ only.\nPerturb 2: Fetch - Legibility + Inconsistent Belief\nDescription: Fetch is a robot that can carry objects from one location to another. There\nare three locations: loc1, loc2, and loc3 where the robot can go.\nThere is a block b1 at location loc1, and the robot is at location loc1 and has its hand\nempty. Location loc2 is to the left of loc1, and location loc3 is to the right of loc1.\nGoals: The robot has to take the block b1 to either loc2 OR loc3 (only one of these\nlocations).\nThe human observer can not see the robot acting in the environment.\nDefinition : A partial plan is a part of robot’s behavior, for example a few actions that\nit takes.\nDefinition : A partial plan is legible if the observer (you) can identify which goal the\nrobot wants to go for. A partial plan A is more legible than another partial plan B if the\nnumber of possible goal locations for A is less than B.\nPlan : In the robot’s partial plan, it picks block b1 and takes one step left.\nQuestion 1 : Imagine you are the human observer. Would you find such a partial plan\nlegible? Give your answer as ’Yes’, ’No’, or ’Can’t say’ only.\nUninformative Context : Inspired by the robustness testing\nin [52], we add an additional context to each of the LLM prompts.\nThis additional context can be understood as a self-contained pair\nof clauses evaluating to False, and hence, having a null effect to the\nreasoning expected by the task prompt.\nInconsistent Belief: An essential component to checking whether\nmental-model reasoning abilities exist, is by including an additional\ncontext which ensures that the correct response can only be com-\nputed through semantic reasoning. Specifically, we include the\nsentence “The human observer can not see the robot acting in the\nenvironment. \"in each prompt. We modify the options for the first\nbinary response question to include Can’t Say (the correct answer)\nalong with Yes/No. We also modify Q2 to include the correct reason\nstating the inability of the human observer to see and understand\nthe agent behavior.\nConviction Test : For a system that exhibits mental-model\nreasoning abilities, we would expect the system to consistently pick\nthe same response (ideally, the correct response) regardless of the\nrepeated queries. In the case of GPT-X family, the temperature (or𝜏)\nparameter controls the stochastic nature of the queried responses.\nIt can be varied in the range of 0 (least)-2 (most) stochasticity\ninfluencing the LLM outputs on each iteration.\n5 EVALUATION DOMAINS\nWe used the following five domains (Fig. 3) for our investigation:\nFetch Robot Fetch is a robot that can carry objects (pick / place)\nand move from one location to another. The situations require the\nrobot to pick the block and navigate to (one of) the goal location.\nPrompt 1: Fetch - Legibility\nDescription: Fetch is a robot that can carry objects from one location to another. There\nare three locations: loc1, loc2, and loc3 where the robot can go.\nThere is a block b1 at location loc1, and the robot is at location loc1 and has its hand\nempty. Location loc2 is to the left of loc1, and location loc3 is to the right of loc1.\nGoals: The robot has to take the block b1 to either loc2 OR loc3 (only one of these\nlocations).\nDefinition : A partial plan is a part of robot’s behavior, for example a few actions that\nit takes.\nDefinition : A partial plan is legible if the observer (you) can identify which goal the\nrobot wants to go for. A partial plan A is more legible than another partial plan B if the\nnumber of possible goal locations for A is less than B.\nPlan : In the robot’s partial plan, it picks block b1 and takes one step left.\nQuestion 1 : Would you find such a partial plan legible? Give your answer as ‘Yes’ or\n‘No’ only.\nPassage Gridworld: In this domain, a rover which exists in a\ngridworld domain with possible blockades that it must navigate\nthrough to reach its goal location.\nPrompt 2: Passage Gridworld - Explicability\nDescription: Consider a 4x4 square grid with each cell numbered as (row, column), the\nrobot needs to travel from top left cell 1 (1,1) to its goal at bottom right cell 15 (4,3). The\nhuman observer (you) expects the robot to take the shortest path by going DOWN 3\nsteps to row 4 (reach 4, 1), and then RIGHT 2 steps to column 3 (reach 4,3).\nConstraint: There are blockades in columns 1, 2 and 3, that the human observer (you)\ndo not know of, but the robot does.\nDefinition : Plan Explicability means whether the plan / robot behavior is an expected\nbehavior according to the human observer (you). If you look at the robot behavior and\nfind that some actions are unnecessary or not required, then the behavior is inexplicable.\nPlan: The robot goes RIGHT 3 steps in row 1 (reach 1,4), goes DOWN 3 steps in column\n4 (reach 4,4), and LEFT 1 step in row 4 (4,3).\nQuestion 1: Imagine you are the human observer, would you find such a plan explicable?\nGive your answer as ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ only.\nEnvironment Design Gridworld: The environment design\ndomain tests LLMs on the design choices of a gridworld environ-\nment that correspond to an agent’s explicable behavior (and for\nother three behavior types).\nHRI ’24 Companion, March 11–14, 2024, Boulder, CO, USA Mudit Verma, Siddhant Bhambri, and Subbarao Kambhampati\nPrompt 3: Environment Design - Obfuscation\nDescription: There is a 3x3 square grid numbered as (row, column) = (1,1) the bottom\nleft cell and (3,3) is the top right cell. The robot needs to travel from cell 1 (1,1) to achieve\ntwo goals G1, placed at (3,1) and G2, placed at (3,2). The robot cannot go through cells\nthat have an obstacle. The robot can go UP, DOWN, LEFT or RIGHT. Finally, there may\nbe objects placed in one or more cells, and the agent will incur a very high cost on\nvisiting these two cells.\nSuppose there is only one instantiation of this grid based on how these obstacles are\nplaced in the environment:\nSetup A : No obstacles.\nGoals : The robot needs to find a plan to reach one of the two goals, G1 and G2.\nDefinition: An environment is designed for obfuscation when all the plan completions\nare equally worse for all the agent goals. This is useful when the agent wants to achieve\na certain goal say G1 but does not want the observer (you) to realize which among set\nof possible goals it wants to achieve. An environment designed for obfuscations allows\nfor plans that lets the agent hide which goal it wants to achieve for as long as possible.\nQuestion 1 : For the setup there are multiple plans possible, for example to goto cells\n(1,1) RIGHT (1, 2) RIGHT (1,3) UP (2, 3), LEFT(2, 2), LEFT (2, 1) UP (3, 1) RIGHT (3, 2).\nAnother shorter plan can be (1,1) UP (2,1) UP (3,1) RIGHT (3,2). Do you think that the\nenvironment is designed for obfuscation? Give your answer only as Yes or No.\nPackage Delivery: The Package Delivery domain presents yet\nanother complex scenario where a human is observing an agent\nacting in a partially observable port management scenario where.\nPrompt 4: Package Delivery - Obfuscation\nDescription: Consider a situation where there is a robot which manages a shipping\nport, and a human observer (you) who is the supervisor that has sensors or subordinates\nat the port who provide partial information about the nature of activity being carried\nout at the port. For instance, when a specific crate is loaded onto the ship, the observer\nfinds out about the identity of the loaded crate. The observer knows the initial inventory\nat the port, but when new cargo is acquired by the port, the observer’s sensors reveal\nonly that more cargo was received; they do not specify the numbers or identities of the\nreceived crates.\nInitial state: There are packages at the port.\nGoal: The robot can either pick and acquire a package on the port, or else pick and load\nit on the ship.\nDefinition: Suppose you think the robot is trying to achieve one out of a set of of\npotential goals. If the agent’s behavior does not reduce the size of this set, then it is\nobfuscatory. For example, if you think robot is trying to achieve one of A, B, C. If it\nshows a behavior (partial plan) but you think it is still trying to achieve any one of A, B,\nC, then it is obfuscatory.\nPlan : Suppose the agent picks up the package and holds it between the port and the\nship.\nQuestion 1 : Would you find such a partial plan obfuscatory? Give your answer as ‘Yes’\nor ‘No’ only.\nUSAR: Urban Search And Rescue is a popular domain where\nthe robot and a human observer (commander) perform triage and\nrescue operations. The robot uses the LLM to query how a certain\nplan will be perceived by the commander.\nPrompt 5: USAR - Predictability\nDescription : In a typical Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) setting, there is a build-\ning with interconnected rooms and hallways. There is a human commander CommX,\nand a robot agent acting in the environment. Both the agents can move around and\npickup/drop-off or handover med-kits to each other. CommX can only interact with\nmed-kits light in weight, but the robot agent can interact with heavy med-kits too.\nInitial State : There is a medkit located in the middle of the hallway, and there are two\npaths to a patient room from there (one on the LEFT, and one on the RIGHT).\nThe observer (you) has the top-view of this setting.\nGoal : Agent has to pickup medkit and take it to the patient room.\nDefinition: A partial plan A is predictable if the observer (you) can identify if there is\none possible completion (which may or may not lead to the goal). A partial plan A is\nmore predictable than a partial plan B if the number of possible completions of A is less\nthan B.\nPlan : In the robot’s partial plan, it picks up the medkit, and takes one step LEFT.\nQuestion 1 : Would you find such a partial plan predictable? Give your answer as ‘Yes’\nor ‘No’ only.\n6 RESULTS\nWe breakdown our discussion on the results to answer the three\nresearch questions, as mentioned in Section 4. In summary, we\nbegin with evaluating human subjects performance on our five\nevaluation domains in 6.1, which validates our evaluation prompts,\nand also acts as a baseline when comparing LLM performance in\n6.2. Finally, we shift our focus to testing the robustness of LLMs\nwith an in-depth analysis of their failure modes in 6.3.\n6.1 RQ1 : Human Subjects on ToM-PROBE task\nTo validate our text prompts querying for Theory of Mind abilities\nand to establish a baseline, we report the user response average ac-\ncuracy and standard deviation for the binary response question (Q1)\nand the MCQ response question (Q2), across five domains in Figure\n4 (c.f. Table 2 in Appendix for more details). We use the same text as\nvignettes shown in Section 5, as LLM prompts. To answer our RQ1,\nwe note that users were correctly able to answer both questions for\neach of the five domains with a minimum average accuracy of 69%,\nexcept for the case of Package Delivery domain where the accu-\nracy was relatively lower in Legibility and Predictability behavior\nprompts. We recall that Q2 conveys the correct answer (regardless\nof the user response to Q1) and we request them to \"rethink and\nselect an explanation\". A much higher number of users could cor-\nrectly identify the reasoning choice in Q2, including users who had\nincorrectly answered Q1 (see Fig. 4b).\n(a) Q1 - Binary Response\n (b) Q2 - MCQ Response\nFigure 4: Human subject performance across five domains.\n6.2 RQ2: LLMs Performance Alignment\n6.2.1 Performance Comparison : To answer our second research\nquestion (RQ2), we begin with comparing the performance accuracy\nof GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo with human subjects and oracle, as\nshown in Figure 5. To our expectations, GPT-4 performs better than\nGPT-3.5-turbo in all but one behavior type, i.e., for predictability\nwhere their accuracies are equal.\n6.2.2 Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) Test : For further evaluating the\nalignment between LLM responses andhuman subjects, we perform\nthe KS test between the two populations of (scaled) user responses\nand GPT-4 responses with the null hypothesis 𝐻0: the two popu-\nlations belong to the same distribution . For a KS test with sample\nsize 20, the critical value for significance level 0.01 is 0.356, and for\nsignificance level 0.05 is 0.294. We observe that the observed critical\nvalue is 0.04, and hence, we accept the null hypothesis. We also run\nthe KS test between GPT-4 responses and the ground truth results,\nand obtain 0.3 as the observed critical value at which 𝐻0 can only\nToM abilities of LLMs in HRI : An Illusion?

These tests have been run using the GPT-4 results obtained\nwith the hyperparameter 𝜏 (temperature) set to 0. With 𝜏 = 1, we\nobtain the similar results with the observed critical values 0.07 and\n0.35 in the two respective cases. Hence, we conclude from these re-\nsults that GPT-4’s performance aligns with that of human subjects\nas compared to the case of oracles or ground truth.\n6.2.3 Subjective Response Evaluation: Additionally, for Q3 of in our\nuser study, we record the average scores for human evaluations on\nLLM descriptive reasoning responses. These ratings are in the [1-5]\nLikert scale where 1 implies users strongly disgree and at 5 users\nstrongly agree with the GPT-4’s explanation. We find that GPT-4\ndescriptive responses to vanilla prompt are generally agreed by the\nusers (with average Likert rating of Explicability : 3.47, Legibility :\n4.23, Predictability : 4.0, Obfuscation : 4.08) further bolstering the\n(illusion) belief that LLMs are in fact performing second order ToM\n(c.f. Figure 12 in the Appendix for more details). For completeness,\nwe use an automated method of comparing the correct explanation\nin Q2 and descriptive explanation by GPT-4 by using gpt-3.5\nas a semantic text similarity tool (see prompt 6 in Appendix for\nFigure 8: Conviction Test Results - Performance distribution\nof LLMs across behavior types when prompted 10 indepen-\ndent times with 𝜏 = 2 (see Appendix for 𝜏 = 0 & 𝜏 = 1).\nmore details) in Figure 6, with average ratings of Explicability : 3.4,\nLegibility : 4, Predictability : 3.8, Obfuscation : 3.4.\n6.3 RQ3: Failure modes of LLMs in ToM-PROBE\nWhile RQ1 and RQ2 yield extremely motivating and positive re-\nsults in favor of GPT-4 showing ToM abilities, we clarify that our\nRQ3 breaks this illusion. Revisiting our research question 3 to test\nLLM robustness for correctly answering Theory-of-Mind reasoning\nquestions, we report the results for GPT-4’s performance on the\nbinary question for all behavior types across the five evaluation\ndomains in Figure 7.\n6.3.1 Uninformative Context. In the case of our first perturbation\n(see Prompt 1), we note a drop in performance across all four behav-\nior types. Note that past works [52] have considered even a single\nincorrect response on this perturbation test enough to disregard\nany emergent abilities of LLM.\n6.3.2 Inconsistent Belief. In the case of the second perturbation\n(see Prompt 2), GPT-4 is unable to get even a single correct response\nin all but one out of the 20 cases. This should not be surprising as\nprior work has already shown that LLMs cannot reason [54]. The\nInconsistent Belief Tests checks relies on inferring the correct men-\ntal state which in-turn requires reasoning over given information\nin the prompt.\n6.3.3 Conviction Test. While it would be expected for a true ToM\nreasoner that multiple queries of the same prompt results in the\nsame answer, we find that GPT-4 does not remain consistent with its\nresponses even when they are incorrect. The LLM keeps switching\nanswers between “Yes/No\" for Q1 when sampled 10 times under\n𝜏 = 2, as shown in Figure 8. Note, that we would ideally expect\nto have the same answer, irrespective of the correctness and the\nnumber of times the LLM is queried. Furthermore, we note that\nwhile GPT-4 is inconsistent in its responses, GPT-3.5-turbo performs\nmuch worse and gives irrelevant responses. For an automated agent\nwhich may utilize a language model for querying for ToM problems,\nHRI ’24 Companion, March 11–14, 2024, Boulder, CO, USA Mudit Verma, Siddhant Bhambri, and Subbarao Kambhampati\nsuch inconsistent and irrelevant responses could lead to unreliable\nperformance, thereby impacting the human-robot interaction.\nAlthough the results from vanilla prompts and the user study\nbuild the illusion of ToM abilities in LLMs, we conclude that our\nperturbation experiments are sufficient to clarify that ToM abilities\nare absent from LLMs. ToM evaluation must entail evaluation of\nreasoning abilities with minimal leniency towards failure cases.\n7 CASE STUDY\nIn our previous discussions, the prompts queried to LLMs and the\nuser study were solely text based as LLMs like GPT4 and GPT3.5\nare limited to textual input. Specifically, the robot has to convert\nits plan into a human-interpretable text (such as natural language\nor more formal PDDL syntax) which is shown to the user subjects.\nWe extend our arguments along an additional modality where user\nsubjects observe a real robot acting in the world. We consider the\ncase of the Fetch Robot’s legibility prompt for this case study. We\nanswer the following research question :\nExtended Research Question 1: How do human subjects perform\non HRI ToM-PROBE when observing a real robot?\n7.1 Study design & Procedure\nWe use the Fetch robot to execute maneuvers as described in Fetch-\nLegibility prompt 1. The robot picks up a block on the table and\ntakes a step left. This partial plan implicitly indicates the robot’s\nchoice of going to the goal on left (instead of the goal on the right)\nmaking the partial plan legible. The user subjects have to answer\n(Q1) and (Q2). Further, we consider the case of the two perturba-\ntions proposed in section 4.3 where in Uninformative Context test\nthe Fetch robot has a label saying \"Not a Legible robot\" but the\nhuman cannot read (operationalized by a attaching a label in small\nfont so the subjects are not able to read) and the Inconsistent Belief\ntest where the human observer is unable to see the robot (opera-\ntionalized by mosaic blurring of the robot). The users answer (Q1)\nfor the two perturbation tests. They use the Google Form based\ninterface with access to a video showing the Fetch robot maneuver\nin addition to the text as before. We recruit 20 new participants on\nProlific with the same requirements as in section 4.2.3. Participant’s\ndemographics details can be found in Table 1.\n7.2 Results\nWe ask the human subjects whether they can read the text on\nthe robot’s head (Fig 1:center) or see the robot acting (Fig 1:right)\nas a binary question. 100% users responded they could not read\nthe text and 95% could not see the robot acting which validates\nour operationalization of the perturbation. GPT4-Vision [ 36] is\nalso fed with image frames obtained via stratified sampling (step\nsize 𝑘 = {6,12,24,30}) from the video along with the text prompt.\nAcross all sampling step sizes, the LLM always responds that it can-\nnot read the text and cannot see the robot acting in the respective\ncases. We find that the user subject responses and accuracy (90%\nusers correctly identified the behavior-type as legible and 85% users\ngave correct answer to Q2) are consistent with Fetch-Legibility\ntext-only case which establishes our baseline that human users\ncan answer ToM queries for the constructed vanilla situation. We\nfind that the users are not affected by the Uninformative Context\n(85% users correctly identified behavior-type and 95% users chose\nthe correct explanation in Q2) and Inconsistent Belief perturba-\ntions (75% correctly opted for “Can’t Say\" choice and 25% chose\n“No\" option). The high accuracy values between vanilla case and\nperturbation case shows that users were not affected by pertur-\nbations. GPT4-V correctly identifies the behavior-type along with\nthe correct reasoning in the vanilla case, however, it fails in the\nInconsistent Belief test and the Conviction test. We note that, while\nGPT4-V answers that it cannot see the robot acting, it still fails Q1\nwhich also reflects inconsistent reasoning abilities. More details\ncan be found in Section A.3.\n8 CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK\nIn this work we perform a critical investigation of the theory of\nmind (ToM) abilities of Large Language Models specifically de-\nsigned for Human Robot Interaction. We consider the second order\nToM setup where a robot can query an LLM (acting as a human\nproxy) to \"think how a human observer would perceive the robot’s\nbehavior\" which can be further utilizes to improve behavior syn-\nthesis. We leverage prior works and identify key behavior-types\ncritical for HRI and behavior synthesis - explicability, legibility,\npredictability and obfuscatory behavior. We use prior works to\nborrow five HRI domains for these behavior types and construct\nvarious situations where the robot behavior belongs to these behav-\nior types. Each of these situations (domain description paired with\nrobot behavior) is given as context to answer two questions. First,\nto recognize whether the human observing the robot would find\nits behavior to be of a given behavior type. Second, we ask for an\nobjective explanation (by choosing among a set of choices) for their\nanswer to the first question. We perform a human subject study to\nobtain lay-user performance measure on these tasks and compare\nit to LLM performance (on GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo). While the\nLLM’s performance on the first set of experiments is much better\nthan chance behavior, our experiments testing LLMs robustness\nand conviction highlight that LLMs, while a useful tool for HRI,\nare not robust ToM agents. Specifically, we find that LLMs fail in\nour perturbation tests, i.e. Inconsistent Belief and Uninformative\nContext test and do not possess conviction in its responses. Finally,\nwe provide a case study with Fetch Robot to emphasize that the\nsituations considered in our work are translations of real-world\nobjectives that robot’s may have with human observer in the loop,\nand bolster existing belief that humans are robust towards ToM\nperturbations that we consider.\nOur work provides a first analysis of LLM ToM abilities for\nan HRI setting and opens up research opportunities in studying\nthe various facets of ToM with LLMs. While future generations of\nLLMs may improve on vanilla ToM tasks, it becomes every more\nimportant to identify and study other crucial failure modes to realize\nwhether the LLM responses are retrieval based or reasoning based.\nWe hope that our contribution can bring forth the HRI community\nto realize the impact, potential benefits and cautions of utilizing\nLarge Language Models in HRI setting.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThis research is supported in part by ONR grants N00014-18-1-2442,\nN14-18-1-2840 and N00014-23-1-2409.\nToM abilities of LLMs in HRI : An Illusion?

There is a block b1 at location loc1, and the robot is at location loc1\nand has its hand empty.\nGoal: The robot has to take the block b1 to location loc2.\nDefinition : Plan Explicability means whether the plan / robot behavior is an expected\nbehavior according to the human observer (you). If you look at the robot behavior and\nfind that some actions are unnecessary or not required, then the behavior is inexplicable.\nPlan : The robot tucks its arms and lowers itself. It then picks up the block b1. Finally,\nthe robot moves to location loc2.\nQuestion 1 : Imagine you are the human observer, would you find such a plan explicable?\nGive your answer as ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ only.\n——————-\nQuestion 2 : Why do you think the robot’s plan is not explicable? Give your response\nonly as ’1’, ’2’ or ’3’ based on the following options and do not include any other text in\nyour response: 1) The plan is not explicable because the robot tucked its arm before\nmoving, which seems unnecessary. 2) The plan is not explicable because the robot\npicked up block b1 which seems unnecessary. 3) The plan is not explicable because no\nplan is explicable.\nPrompt 8: Fetch - Legibility\nDescription: Fetch is a robot that can carry objects from one location to another. There\nare three locations: loc1, loc2, and loc3 where the robot can go.\nThere is a block b1 at location loc1, and the robot is at location loc1 and has its hand\nempty. Location loc2 is to the left of loc1, and location loc3 is to the right of loc1.\nGoals: The robot has to take the block b1 to either loc2 OR loc3 (only one of these\nlocations).\nDefinition : A partial plan is a part of robot’s behavior, for example a few actions that\nit takes.\nDefinition : A partial plan is legible if the observer (you) can identify which goal the\nrobot wants to go for. A partial plan A is more legible than another partial plan B if the\nnumber of possible goal locations for A is less than B.\nPlan : In the robot’s partial plan, it picks block b1 and takes one step left.\nQuestion 1 : Would you find such a partial plan legible? Give your answer as ‘Yes’ or\n‘No’ only.\n——————-\nQuestion 2 : Why do you think the robot’s plan is legible? Give your response only\nas ’1’, ’2’ or ’3’ based on the following options and do not include any other text in\nyour response: 1) The plan is legible because the robot made its goal of taking the block\nto location loc2 more legible. 2) The plan is legible because the robot made its goal of\npicking up the block more legible. 3) The plan is legible because all robot plans are\nlegible.\nPrompt 9: Fetch - Predictability\nDescription: Fetch is a robot that can carry objects from one location to another.\nInitial state: There is a block b1 at location loc1, and the robot is at location loc1 and\nhas its hand empty. Location locX can be reached from location loc1 using two paths,\none by taking five steps to left and the other one by taking five steps to right.\nGoal: The robot has to pick the block b1 and take it to location locX.\nDefinition: A partial plan A is predictable if the observer (you) can identify if there is\none possible completion (which may or may not lead to the goal). A partial plan A is\nmore predictable than a partial plan B if the number of possible completions of A is less\nthan B.\nPlan : In the robot’s partial plan, it picks block b1 and takes one step towards left.\nQuestion 1 : Would you find such a partial plan predictable? Give your answer as ‘Yes’\nor ‘No’ only.\n——————-\nQuestion 2 : Why do you think the robot’s plan is predictable? Give your response\nonly as ’1’, ’2’ or ’3’ based on the following options and do not include any other text in\nyour response: 1) because the robot will go to locX from left path. 2) because the robot\nwill go to locX from right path. 3) because all paths are predictable.\nPrompt 10: Fetch - Obfuscation\nDescription: Fetch is a robot that can carry objects from one location to another. Fetch\nrobot’s design requires it to tuck its arms and lower its torso or crouch before moving.\nThere are three locations: loc1, loc2, and loc3.\nInitial state: There is a block b1 at location loc1, and the robot is at location loc1 and\nhas its hand empty.\nDefinition: Suppose you think the robot is trying to achieve one out of a set of of\npotential goals. If the agent’s behavior does not reduce the size of this set, then it is\nobfuscatory. For example, if you think robot is trying to achieve one of A, B, C. If it\nshows a behavior (partial plan) but you think it is still trying to achieve any one of A, B,\nC, then it is obfuscatory.\nPlan : Suppose the agent picks up the block b1. At loc1 is the agent is at a distance of\n10 steps from loc2 and loc3. It takes 3 steps forward and is 7 steps away from loc2 as\nwell as loc3.\nQuestion 1 : Would you find such a partial plan obfuscatory? Give your answer as ‘Yes’\nor ‘No’ only.\n——————-\nQuestion 2 : Why do you think the robot’s plan is obfuscatory? Give your response\nonly as ’1’, ’2’ or ’3’ based on the following options and do not include any other\ntext in your response: 1) because the robot can possibly go to either location loc2 or\nlocation loc3. 2) because the robot will only go to location loc2. 3) because all plans are\nobfuscatory.\nB.2 Passage Gridworld Domain\nPrompt 11: Passage Gridworld - Explicability\nDescription: Consider a 4x4 square grid with each cell numbered as (row, column), the\nrobot needs to travel from top left cell 1 (1,1) to its goal at bottom right cell 15 (4,3).
