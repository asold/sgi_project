Among the seed-based oils \nstudied is Jatropha oil which was reported to have suitable breakdown strength for high \nvoltage application. However, most of the reports did not study the ageing characteristics \nof the oil and its compatibility with cellulose insulation. In this present study, the properties \nand ageing behaviour of a freshly prepared Jatropha oil and its compatibility with cellulose \ninsulation paper were evaluated. The oil was purified through modified Dijkstra and Opstal \npurification method. The thermo-physical and dielectric studies of the oil was performed \nand thermal ageing of Kraft paper in the prepared ester fluid was performed. Thermally \naccelerated ageing was performed with an open beaker containing ageing catalysts, \nthermally upgraded insulation paper, and the fluid at 140°C for 120, 240, 360 and 480 h. \nJatropha oil is a high temperature fluid with high specific heat capacity of 2.59 kJ kg\n−1 K \nand low dielectric loss of 0.009. The oil became polymerised with ageing in open cup. This \nmay be due to thermo-oxidative degradation of the oil that progressed with ageing time. \nThis is an indication that the oil is not suitable for use in free breathing power equipment.\nKeywords: Dielectric fluid, insulating materials, paper insulation, dielectric loss, thermal \nageing\n1. INTrODUcTION\nThe idea of using natural ester fluid for electrical insulation in oil-filled electric \nequipment was conceived as far back as 1892. The development suffered a setback \nbecause the thermo-oxidative stability of the oil was inferior compared with \nconventional mineral oil-based transformer fluid.\n1 Mineral-based dielectric liquid \nAssessment of Jatropha Oil 2\nis commonly used in power transformers as they have good insulating and cooling \nproperties. However, they are known to be poorly-biodegradable and toxic. 2 In a \nquest for alternative insulating fluids to mineral oil, a number of other fluids has \nbeen considered. They could not serve as better alternatives either because they \ncould not meet the health and safety conditions, and are also more costly. Further \nefforts on the quest for alternative insulating fluids in the 90s show that vegetable \noil with its environmental, safety and health benefits can still serve as a viable \nalternative insulating fluid.\n2 \nAlthough recent reports show that natural ester insulating fluid performs very well \nas an insulant and coolant, its high viscosity has posed a design challenge and its \npoor thermo-oxidative property has limited its application.\n3–5 Seed-based oils have \ntwo opposing properties: pour point and oxidative stability. These properties are \ndependent on the content of unsaturated fatty acids in the oil. The thermal and \noxidative instability of the oil increase as the fatty acids in oil progresses from \nsaturation to mono-unsaturation and poly-unsaturation. The higher the unsaturated \nfatty acid content, the higher the oxidative instability of the oil and poor oxidative \nstability is not desirable in insulating fluids.\n4 Conversely, the melting and pour \npoints of the oil decrease with increase in the percentage of unsaturated fatty acid \ncontent. \nThe unsaturated fatty acids generally have lower melting and pour points than \nthe saturated fatty acids. The high pour point of saturated fatty acid results from \nits uniform molecular shape, which enables the molecules to pack efficiently \nas it solidifies. Crystal formation is difficult in unsaturated fatty acids because \nof the bends and kinks introduced by the carbon-carbon double bonds.\n6 This \nlimits the ability of the fatty acids to be closely packed. As a result, the more \nthe unsaturation, the harder it becomes for the molecules to crystallise. This will \nhave the consequence of lowering the pour point of the oil and low pour point is a \ndesirable property of insulating fluids.\n7 \nSeed oil with higher percentage of unsaturated fatty acids has lower melting \nand pour points but poor stability to thermo-oxidation, while the seed oils with \nhigher percentage of saturated fatty acids have better oxidative stability but higher \nmelting and pour points. A number of vegetable oils has been studied for electrical \ninsulation and there are commercially available natural ester dielectric fluids in \nthe market such as Environtemp FR3 fluid produced from sunflower oil and Midel \neN fluid produced from rapeseed oil.\n3,8–11 Most of the popular works on Jatropha \noil were on its performance as biodiesel but there were also few works on its \nsuitability as electrical insulating fluid. The oil was reported to possess properties \nthat made it suitable for electrical insulation.\n12 \nJournal of Physical Science, V ol. 29(1), 1–16, 2018 3\nIt was reported that refined Jatropha oil has breakdown voltage of 35.8 kV in a \nspherical electrode with 2.5 mm gap. 13 This is within the specified breakdown \nvoltage for fluid for high voltage insulation. However, the ageing behaviour of the \noil was not reported. A number of non-edible seed-based oil including Jatropha \noil is known to be available in Nigeria and an earlier attempt was made to study \nthe viability of developing insulating fluid from Nigerian palm kernel oil.\n14 These \noils are easily biodegradable with chemical structure that makes possible its \nmodification to improve the thermal properties and oxidative stability. This paper \ntherefore presents a study on the dielectric and thermal study of Jatropha oil, its \nageing behaviour and its compatibility with insulation paper.\n2. EXPErIMENTAL\n2.1 sample Preparation\nA modified Dijkstra and Opstal purification method was adopted for the \npurification of the sample to obtain the purified Jatropha oil (PJOF) sample.  \nA 200 ml solution of crude Jatropha oil (CJO) sample was heated in a 500 ml \nconical flask to 70°C and 8 vol% of 64 vol% aqueous citric acid solution was added \ngently and mixed thoroughly with a magnetic stirrer for 15 min.\n15 An amount of \n4 ml of 8 vol% NaOH solution was gently added and the mixture stirred at 400 \nrpm for 15 min. The mixture was then dried in vacuum oven at 85°C for 30 min to \nreduce the water content. An amount of 2 g of silica gel was added to the mixture \nat 70°C and agitated for 30 min at 300 rpm to prevent it from settling out. Fuller’s \nearth was then added and continuously stirred for 30 min at 8 wt%. The sample \nwas then filtered with filter paper in vacuum oven at 85°C.\n2.2 Thermal Properties\nTo determine the cloud and pour points, the oil sample was placed in cylindrical \ntest tube placed in an ice/salt bath. It was inspected at interval temperature and the \ntemperature at which a distinct cloudiness appeared at the bottom of the test tube \nwas recorded as the cloud point of the sample. The sample was then allowed to \ncool below 0ºC. The sample was tilted on the clamp at interval of 2°C. The lowest \ntemperature at which there was a movement of the oil was recorded as the pour \npoint.\n16\nThe specific heat capacity of the oil can be determined by heating a sample of \nthe oil in a beaker in vacuum to a certain temperature. The sample was quickly \ntransferred into a lagged copper calorimeter with a copper stirrer. It was stirred for \nAssessment of Jatropha Oil 4\n5 min and the final temperature was measured. The specific heat capacity of the oil \nsample was calculated from the formula:17\nmm\nmm\n23\n1\n1c\ncc s\n+ ii\nii\n-\n-\n_\n_ _\n_\ni\ni\ni\ni  (1)\nwhere mc is mass of calorimeter, mc is mass of stirrer, m1 is mass of calorimeter \nplus oil sample, cc is specific heat capacity of copper, cs is specific heat capacity \nof stirrer, c 0 is specific heat capacity of oil sample, θ 1 is initial temperature of \noil sample, θ 2 is temperature of boiling oil sample, θ 3 is final temperature of oil \nsample, calorimeter and stirrer.\n2.3 rheology\nThe density and specific gravity of oil samples were measured using specific \ngravity bottle at room temperature. The dynamic viscosity of a liquid is directly \nrelated to the heat transfer coefficient of the oil, and the viscosity is dependent on \ntemperature change in the oil. The viscosity of the liquid samples was measured \nusing Brookfield Viscometer with the appropriate spindle. The sample container \nwas placed in water bath heated on a thermostatically controlled hot plate to vary \nthe temperature of the sample within accuracy of ±0.1ºC. Temperature sensor was \nimmersed in the water bath to monitor the temperature. Each measurement was \ntaken three times and the average calculated for accuracy.\n2.4 Dielectric Properties\nThe conduction property of the liquid samples was studied using HM8118 LCR \nBridge within frequency of 20 to 200 kHz. The liquid was placed in a parallel \nplate test cell. The dielectric constant and dissipation factor was measured from \nthe bridge at ambient temperature of 30°C. The study under frequency spectrum \nis to understand the loss mechanism that result in conduction in the liquid. The \ndissipation factor which is also referred to as loss tangent or tan δ is obtained from \nthe ratio of the leakage current density to the capacitive current density.\n2.5 compatibility with Insulation Paper Test\nInsulations in transformers are composite systems. They include oil, Kraft papers \nof different thicknesses, and pressboard of different thicknesses. The test for the \ncompatibility of the solid insulation in the natural ester is very important. An \nageing experiment was set up to test the ageing behaviour of Jatropha oil and its \ncompatibility with insulating paper. A 250 ml solution of Jatropha oil was first \nfiltered using a medium fast filter paper with pore size of 125 mm. The oil sample \nJournal of Physical Science, V ol. 29(1), 1–16, 2018 5\nin a vessel was placed in vacuum oven and dried at a temperature of 70°C for 24 h. \nThe vacuum oven was then allowed to cool to ambient temperature for 24 h and \nthe oil sample was transferred to the ageing vessel. \nThe thermally upgraded insulating paper with thickness 0.255 mm and 15 g \nweight was vacuum dried in vacuum oven at 85°C for 24 h. The paper was then \nimpregnated with Jatropha oil in vacuum for impregnation using the capillary \nmethod. The ageing vessel containing the oil sample, 15 g of 0.255 mm thick Kraft \npaper, galvanised steel strip (3.5 cm × 3.5 cm), copper strip (3.5 cm × 4.5 cm), \naluminium strip (4 cm × 4 cm), and mild steel was placed in vacuum oven at room \ntemperature. The galvanised steel represents the core of a transformer, while the \ncopper and aluminium strip represents the conducting coils.\n17 The Kraft insulation \npaper samples were packed together and placed in between the metals sheets.  \nThe vessel was thermally aged at 150°C for 480 h. Samples of aged cellulose \npapers were taken out of the vessel for analysis.\n3. rEsULTs AND DIscUssIONs\nFigure 1 shows the Jatropha oil samples under study. Table 1 shows the measured \nvalues of the density, dynamic viscosity, cloud point, pour point, flash point and \nspecific heat capacity of the CJO sample, PJOF and compared with that of mineral \noil.\nFigure 1: Samples of CJO (left) and PJOF (right).\nPJOF was found to have a density and dynamic viscosity of 890 kg m −3 and \n35.6 mPas respectively at 30°C. The viscosity is higher compared with mineral oil \nbut comparable to that of ester-based insulating fluids. The pour point of Jatropha \nAssessment of Jatropha Oil 6\noil was determined to be −6°C. It can be further improved with the addition of \npour point depressant. The flash point of the oil sample was determined to be \n195°C; the flash point is higher than the minimum specification for mineral oil \nbased insulating fluid.\n18 The specific heat capacity of the oil was determined to be \n2.59 kJ kg−1 K which is much higher compared with mineral oil with specific heat \ncapacity of 1.67 kJ kg−1 K.\nTable 1: Experimental results of Jatropha oil in comparison with mineral oil.\nProperties CJO PJOF Mineral oil\nDensity at 30°C (kg m−3) 891 890 880\nDynamic viscosity at 30°C (mPa.s) 38.5 35.6 12.3\nCloud point (°C) 6 7 −10\nPour point (°C) −5 −5 −34\nFlash point (°C) 196 195 149\nSpecific heat capacity (kJ kg−1 K) 2.54 2.59 1.67\nDielectric constants of the oil samples were obtained from the measured capacitance \nwith programmable LCR Bridge. The dielectric constant of the samples was plotted \nagainst frequency as shown in Figure 2. The response of dielectric constant of \ncrude and purified samples to frequency change have similar pattern. The dielectric \nconstant of CJO at 100 Hz is 3.7 while that of PJOF is 3.8 at the same frequency \nas shown in Table 2.\nLog Frequency (Hz)\nDielectric Constant\nK CJO\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n3.5\n4.5\n5.5\n6.5\n7.5\n8.5\n15015 1500 15000 150000\nK PJOF\nFigure 2: Variation of the dielectric constant of Jatropha oil with logarithm of frequency.\nJournal of Physical Science, V ol. 29(1), 1–16, 2018 7\nLoss Tangent\nLog Frequency (Hz)\nD CJO0.14\n0.12\n0.1\n0.08\n0.06\n0.04\n0.02\n0\n100 1000 10000 100000\nD PJOFFigure 3: Variation of the loss tangent of Jatropha oil with logarithm of frequency.\nThe semi-log plot of loss tangent measure with the LCR bridge as a function of \nfrequency for the oil samples is shown in Figure 3. The measurement was within \nthe frequency range of 20 Hz to 200 kHz. The measured tan δ (dielectric loss) \nfor PJOF from 900 Hz to 60 kHz was below detection limit of the measurement \ninstrument. It was observed from the graph that tan δ values of the sample reduced \nafter purification at low frequencies. This suggests that purification has a significant \ninfluence on the loss factor of the oil sample. Tan δ for crude and refined oil were \n0.08 and 0.009 respectively as shown in Table 2. Refining process reduced the loss \ntangent by a factor of 10\n−1. This is an indication that the purification process with \nfuller’s earth may have been adsorb some conducting impurities in the oil samples. \nThis resulted in improved dielectric loss characteristics of the oil.\nThe AC conductivity, which is sometimes considered the effective electrical \nconductivity of a dielectric material since it includes all the loss factors in the \ndielectric, is a function of the measured dielectric constant and dissipation factor. \nAn effective AC conductivity may be defined as the ratio of the leakage current \ndensity to the magnitude of the field at a given frequency arising from conduction \nand dipole orientation losses. The AC conductivity of the samples was evaluated \nusing the equation:\n19\ntanE\nJ1 ~f dv == l  (2)\nAssessment of Jatropha Oil 8\nwhere σ is the electrical conductivity, ε'(ω) is the real component of the relative \npermittivity of the liquid, tan δ (ω) is the loss tangent which measures the energy \ndissipated by the dielectric liquid, ε'(ω) and tan δ (ω) are function of angular \nfrequency, ω, Jt  is the loss current density, and E  is the electric field. The electrical \nconductivity of PJOF as shown in Table 2 falls within insulating material category \nbut is about 2 order of magnitude higher than mineral insulating oil.\nTable 2: Measured parameters at 30°C.\nProperties CJO PJOF Mineral oil\nDielectric constant 3.7 3.8 2.1\nLoss tangent at 30°C 0.08 0.009 0.0002\nAC conductivity (S m−1) 2.98 × 10−9 3.44 × 10−10 1.40 × 10−12\nThe motion of the charged particles responsible for conduction in the liquid may \nhave resulted from the dissociation of ionic and solid impurities in the liquid. Besides \ncausing conduction current, they give rise to polarisation of the dielectric material. \nIf the total loss in the liquid is considered as a combination of DC conductivity and \nloss due to polarisation, the measured dielectric loss can be express as:\n\"00v ~ v~ ff=+^h  (3)\nwhere σ0 is the DC conductivity, ωε 0ε\" is loss due to polarisation, and ε'' is the \nrelative permittivity. Polarisation of charged particles in CJO and PJOF may \nbe responsible for the decrease in the effective conductivity of the oil samples. \nThe lower conductivity of the purified sample compared with the crude sample \nis an indication that the purification process was able to eliminate some of the \nconducting impurities.\nThe relative permittivity and tan δ of the dried and degassed insulating paper, \nunaged oil-impregnated paper and aged oil-impregnated paper at various \nageing time is plotted over a frequency range of 10\n1–105 Hz in Figures 4 and 5.  \nImpregnation of the dried paper with the freshly prepared ester sample shows an \nincrease in the permittivity and tan δ of the composite material. The increase in \npermittivity is expected as oil impregnation makes it possible for the composite \nmaterial to store more charges. The increase in dielectric loss after oil impregnation \nmay have resulted from electrical conduction through the oil that fill the pores \nbetween the fibres of the insulating paper. The oil provides a channel for the \ntransport of ionic impurities in the composite material. \nJournal of Physical Science, V ol. 29(1), 1–16, 2018 9\nRelative Permittivity\nFrequency (Hz)\nFigure 4: Graph of the permittivity for Jatropha oil.\nFrequency (Hz)\nLoss Tangent\nFigure 5: Graph of the loss tangent for Jatropha oil.\nAssessment of Jatropha Oil 10\nAgeing for 120 h shows a decrease in magnitude of relative permittivity and tan δ \nof the composite material. Ageing up till 360 h did not seem to have more impact \non the magnitude of relative permittivity.  However, further ageing for 480 h shows \na significant decrease in relative permittivity. The values were lower than that of \nthe dried paper. The decreasing tan δ value with ageing is an indication that the \ndielectric loss of the sample decrease with ageing of the impregnated paper within \nthe studied ageing time. This may have resulted from the polymerisation of the \noil in the paper, making the composite system to behave more like a polymer than \noil-impregnated paper.\nThe plot of real and imaginary (denoted with “imag” in figure) parts of the \nrelative permittivity is shown in Figure 6. A close observation of the plot shows \na logarithmic shift in both magnitude and frequency of the response towards low \nfrequency with ageing.\n Relative Permittivity\nFrequency (Hz)\nFigure 6: Real and imaginary relative permittivity of aged oil impregnated papers at \n30°C.\nIt is known that the weak polar nature of natural ester makes it possess strong \naffinity for water.\n20 This may have caused water to move from the Kraft paper \ninsulation into the natural ester fluid in larger quantities. The generated water \nduring pyrolysis process is absorbed by the ester. This cumulative equilibrium shift \nof water effectively dries the paper and reduces ageing due to thermo-hydrolytic \ndegradation. The paper is protected from ageing through the water scavenging \nJournal of Physical Science, V ol. 29(1), 1–16, 2018 11\nand steric hindrance of the cellulosic hydrolytic reaction by natural esters.21–23 The \ndrying of the paper may have been responsible for the observed decrease in the \ndielectric constant and dielectric loss of the impregnated paper. The water is then \nconsumed by hydrolysis of the natural ester, producing free fatty acids. This may \nreact with the cellulose backbone via transesterification during thermal ageing \nthereby protecting the cellulose from hydrolysis.\n24\nOil-impregnated Kraft paper is an insulating paper whose voids between the \npaper fibres are filled with oil to improve the insulation strength. Ageing of ester-\nimpregnated paper has been reported to be slower compared with mineral oil-\nimpregnated paper.\n25 Ester impregnated paper behaves like a material with cavities \nfilled with the impregnated oil and all its content. The cavities can also be referred \nto as clusters.\nTwo different contributions can be observed from the dielectric response of \nthe oil-impregnated paper on the application of electric field to the composite \nmaterial when placed between two electrodes as shown in Figure 6. There is a \nfrequency independent real part of the permittivity at the high frequency end of \nthe spectra. This response includes dielectric relaxations taking place in the void at \nfrequencies higher than 10\n4 Hz, together with atomic and electronic polarisations \nfrom quantum resonances. This is referred to as intra-cluster interaction as the \ndipoles interact within the voids. At lower frequencies, there is a dispersion in the \nrelative permittivity. Within this region, there are inter-cluster interactions between \nthe voids and the charges in one void are able to drift into another void.\nThe real and imaginary parts were observed to cross over where the real and \nimaginary parts of the relative permittivity have the same values. This is the \nfrequency where the interactions of the negative and positive charge carriers in \nthe composite material changed from intra-cluster to inter-cluster interactions and \nit will be referred to as the cross-over frequency in this work. Below the cross-\nover frequency, the imaginary part has higher value compared with the real part \nand after the cross-over frequency, the reverse is the case. There appears to be \nlinks between the two processes before and after the cross-over frequency as \nearlier reported by Abdelmalik et al.\n26 Dissado-Hill cluster model was used to \nexplain the interaction.27 Before the cross-over frequency, there is the intra-cluster \ninteraction of the negative and positive charge carriers that are bound together \nas a dipole. Below the cross-over frequency, the negative and positive charge \ncarriers become independent carriers that will result in quasi-dc (q-dc) process \nat much lower frequencies. This can also be called inter-cluster interaction. The \ncross-over frequency can be said to correspond to the onset time (inverse of cross \nover frequency) for the separation of ionic charges across the width of the oil \nAssessment of Jatropha Oil 12\nfilled cavity. This feature of the dielectric response of oil-paper insulation was \nobserved to change with ageing. The cross-over frequency was observed to be \nshifting towards the low frequency end with ageing.\nA plot of the onset of frequency of separation of ionic charges with ageing time is \nshown in Figure 7. The freshly impregnated oil-paper has a cross-over frequency \nof 150 Hz (1.11 × 10\n−3 s) and after ageing of 120 h, the frequency reduced to \n90 Hz (1.77 × 10 −3 s). The frequency did not seem to have much variation for \nageing from 120 h to 360 h. After 480 h of ageing, the frequency reduced to 10 Hz  \n(1.59 × 10−2 s).\nSeparation Frequency (Hz)\nAgeing Time (Hours)\nFigure 7: A plot of frequency of separation of ionic charges with aged time.\nThe plot shows that the separation frequency did not follow a simple relation. \nDielectric response of the aged ester-paper is dependent on various factors which \nincludes the ageing characteristic of both the oil and the paper.\n26 This makes the \nanalysis of dielectric response of ester-paper system complex. It can be observed \nfrom the relationship in Figure 7 that the ageing behaviour of Jatropha oil-paper \nsystem may be difficult to predict from the cross over frequency. At 480 h of \nageing for example, the oil sample was observed to have undergone significant \npolymerisation. The by-products of the process may have also contributed to the \ndielectric response of the oil-paper, thereby influencing the separation frequency.  \nAgeing may have resulted in small modification of the morphology of the fibres \nof the paper leading to frequency shift of the dielectric response. A decrease in \nthe magnitude at the separation frequency in the ester-paper system may be an \nindication of a decrease in the amount of ionic species contributing to the loss \nprocesses as the material aged with time.\nJournal of Physical Science, V ol. 29(1), 1–16, 2018 13\nFigure 8: Polymerised aged sample after 480 h.\nThe ageing took place in an oven that allowed free circulation of air. The oil was \nobserved to have undergone changes with ageing. The colour turned dark and after \n480 h, the oil turned to a gel-like substance as shown in Figure 8. The FTIR spectra \nanalysis of the aged oil samples reveal a peak within the fingerprint region. The \nspectra show that the aged samples exhibit a peak at 960 cm\n−1. The magnitude of \nthe peak increased with ageing. This may have been due to thermal polymerisation \nof the oil. Jatropha oil is 86% unsaturated fatty acid. A search on FTIR database \nrevealed that the peak corresponds to cyclic carboxylic functional group.\n28 The \ncarbon-carbon double bond (−C=C−) in the triglyceride has a strong sigma bond \nand a weak π bond. At high temperature, the π bond in the carbon-carbon double \nbond of the oil may have been modified in the presence of air and cause cross-\nlinking of the fatty acid chains. They may have resulted in the formation of cyclic \ncarboxyl group. The metal catalyst in the ageing setup may have also contributed \nto the acceleration of the thermal degradation of the oil. The increasing magnitude \nis an indication that the thermal polymerisation process progressed with time. This \nis an indication that even though the property of freshly prepared Jatropha oil \nsuggests that it is suitable for high voltage insulation, it may only be useful in \nhermetically sealed system but not in free-breathing power equipment. Its use in \na system open to air may require further modification to improve its oxidative \nstability.\n4. cONcLUsION\nThe properties of freshly prepared Jatropha oil sample seem to be very interesting \nin agreement with earlier reports. Jatropha oil is a high temperature liquid when \ncompared with mineral oil judging from its flash point.\n18 It has viscosity that is \nAssessment of Jatropha Oil 14\ncomparable to the market available natural ester dielectric fluids. They share \nsimilar dielectric constant, low loss and pour point less than 0°C. It also has a low \ndielectric loss. Impregnated cellulose paper with the prepared ester fluid (PJOF \nfluid) shows a dielectric loss that decreased with ageing contrary to most report \nof oil-impregnated paper ageing with increase in dielectric loss. This is thought \nto be due the greater affinity of natural ester fluid for moisture, combined with \nhydrolysis, which caused water to move from the Kraft paper insulation into the \nfluid in larger quantities. This cumulative equilibrium shift of water effectively \ndries the paper, thereby reducing ageing rate due to thermo-hydrolytic degradation. \nHowever, the aged ester fluid at 140°C in air atmosphere was polymerised and \nthe thermal polymerisation process progressed with ageing time 480 h. This is an \nindication that the oil may only be useful in hermetically sealed system but not in \nfree-breathing power equipment. Modifying the oil by converting the double bond \nsite to an epoxy group which is more resistive to thermal degradation may improve \nthe thermo-oxidative properties of the oil. Such modification can make it an all-\npurpose industrial fluid.\n5. rEFErENcEs\n1. McShane, C. P. (2002). Vegetable-oil-based dielectric coolant. IEEE Ind. \nAppl.
