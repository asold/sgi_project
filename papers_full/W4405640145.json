    "abstract": "This research introduces an original approach to time series forecasting through the use of multi-scale convolutional neural networks with Transformer modules. The objective is to focus on the limitations of short-term load forecasting in terms of complex spatio-temporal dependencies. The model begins with the convolutional layers, which perform feature extraction from the time series data to look for features with different temporal resolutions. The last step involves making use of the self-attention component of the Transformer block, which tries to find the long-range dependencies within the series. Also, a spatial attention layer is included to handle the interactions among the different samples. Equipped with these features, the model is able to make predictions. Experimental results show that this model performs better compared to the time series forecasting models in the literature. It is worth mentioning that the MSE score or mean square error of the model was 0.62, while the measure of fit R2 was 0.91 in predicting the individual household electric power consumption dataset. The baseline models for this dataset such as the LSTM model had an MSE of 2.324 and R2 value of 0.79, showing that the proposed model was significantly improved by a margin.",
