Spoken language. Cochlear\nimplant results\nIntroduction\nChildren with profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL)\nexperience delays in learning to understand the speech of\nothers and to produce intelligible speech. The source of\ntheir delays is rooted in a lack of refined access to the\nspectral and temporal cues of the acoustic –phonologic\ncomponents of speech. That is, to learn to understand the\nspeech of others and to speak themselves, a young child\nmust hear the sounds of speech. When armed with such\naccess through hearing technologies and, through the\ninfluences of a highly dynamic system, children with\nSNHL can begin to take command of the basic structures\nof their native, spoken language (Smith and Thelen2003).\nWithout such access, these children face challenges in their\ncognitive and psychosocial development and academic\nperformance. Together, such cascading consequences carry\ndownstream implications for employment and quality of\nlife (Summerfield and Marshall1999; Cheng et al.2000).\nWhen traditional amplification devices (hearing aids) are\nunable to restore access to the full range of phonemic\ncomponents of speech, a cochlear implant (CI) is a widely\nused treatment option for children with SNHL (Bradham\nand Jones2008). CI stimulation of the auditory pathway is\nmade feasible by robust reserves of auditory neurons that\npersist in deafness. On average, about half of the peripheral\nneuronal complement of the cochlea survives even when\ndeafness is profound and of early onset (Nadol 1997).\nFurthermore, surviving neurons retain responsivity to\nelectrical stimulation. Electrical contacts of a CI device\nimplanted into the cochlea can generate currents that\nstimulate subpopulations of auditory neurons. When con-\nfigured across channels (to convey pitch information),\nvariations in the power and tempo of electrical currents\ncan encode sound via spike trains carried by auditory\nneurons. Acoustic inputs are thus conveyed to CNS\nauditory stations for encoding. Advances in sound process-\nors and related software have enhanced the fidelity with\nwhich complex sounds are processed into physiologically\nmeaningful codes.\nEvidence of basic perceptual gains following cochlear\nimplantation is found in consistent improvements in\nhearing thresholds (Pulsifer et al. 2003). However, im-\nproved thresholds for sound awareness represent only a\npreliminary measure of the intervening effect of a cochlear\nimplant. A vast range of levels of hearing and communi-\ncation ability are observed in children who receive cochlear\nimplants, and the true impact is measured by more\nconsequential outcomes than awareness of sound.\nBecause early-onset deafness is typically recessive in its\ngenetic transmission, or is acquired as a result of infection,\nmost deaf children grow up in hearing households. Manual\nstrategies of signing can overcome many barriers to\ncommunication; however, the prevalence of signing in\nsociety is limited, and the depth of engagement with sign\nlanguage in hearing families does not systematically expose\ndeaf children to abstract semantic content (Mitchell and\nQuittner 1996). The resulting communication mismatch\nbetween a deaf infant and a hearing family associates with\nhigher levels of parenting stress, less developmental\nscaffolding, and reduced sensitivity in parent–child inter-\nactions, resulting in negative consequences for later\nlinguistic and psychosoci al development (Polat 2003;\nNikolopoulos et al.2004b).\nThe notion of a“successful implant” often relates to the\nparents’perception of how their child will best relate to the\noutside world. Hearing parents who seek alleviation of their\nchild’s deafness will commonly express a goal of providing\ntheir child with options for real engagement with the\nmainstream, specifically in play and school at an early age,\nand in vocational options and life chances in adulthood.\nThe pervasive nature of communication, within the family\nand in society, suggests a standard metric of outcome.\nBecause the goal of restored hearing in a deaf child is to\nenable useful hearing, a key measure of outcome should\nreflect how a deaf child’s experience with a CI develops\ninto the effective use of spoken language. Parental surveys\nindicate that the outcome of their greatest concern after\nsurgical intervention in children with SNHL is the level of\nspoken language achieved (Nikolopolous et al.2004a).\nDespite its importance, the study of language develop-\nment in children with cochlear implants presents method-\nological challenges. Useful experimental approaches must\naddress the high variability of language performance\nobserved in pediatric populations in general and attempt\nto control for confounds in smaller implanted populations.\nDespite the methodological challenges associated with high\nvariability in results, the potential for key research insights\nexists. Clinically, properly assessed variability offers an\nopportunity to understand modifiers of outcome of this\ntreatment for deaf children and to predict and promote\nsuccess in language acquisition. More general research\nquestions related to neurodevelopment arise, as well;\nunderstanding the factors that contribute to variation in CI\noutcomes in this population offers insight into the interac-\ntion of influences that contribute to language learning in\ngeneral. Children identified as candidates for CIs represent\na population that has experienced significant auditory\nJ Neurodevelop Disord (2011) 3:388–404 389\ndeprivation during a period when communication growth\nnormally advances at an accelerated rate. With intervention\nand an ultimate restoration of auditory inputs, studies of\ndevelopmental effects can offer key neurobiological per-\nspectives (Pisoni et al. 2008; Smith et al. 1998). The\nenormous variation observed in measures of early speech\nand language development in children with a CI thus calls\nfor multivariable assessment of intervening and modifying\nvariables in which baseline variables are captured with\naccuracy and their longitudinal associations are measured in\na way that averts floor and ceiling effects.\nPrior clinical studies have supported the use of an early CI,\nthough their case series designs have generally been limited\nby lack of generalizability, insufficient sample sizes to support\nconclusions, inability to account for confounds, lack of\nassessment of parental influences, and absence of parallel\nobservations from a control group (Fink et al.2007). Our\ncurrent study attempts to address prior limitations. The\nChildhood Development after Cochlear Implantation\n(CDaCI) study is a prospective, multidimensional, multisite\ntrial that examines several dimensions of language learning\nin children receiving a CI under the age of 5 years and uses\nnormal hearing age-matched controls. A longitudinal design\nenables the development of growth curves examining\nmodifiers of language learning. The design of the CDaCI\nstudy also enables adjustment based on factors known to\ncontribute to language learning and examination of novel\npredictors of implant outcomes, such as quality of parent–\nchild interactions.\nHere, we summarize findings that demonstrate prognos-\ntic value for language learning for variables of baseline\nlanguage development, parent–child interactions, and age\nand hearing level at the time of CI surgery. Against a\nbackground of the dynamics of language learning and\nepigenetics, we consider a multivariable model of predic-\ntive and modifying factors that demonstrate significantly\nimproved developmental trajectories for verbal language in\nchildren implanted before 18 months of age in the context\nof epigenetic control of language learning and variable\nimpact of modifying factors across age-at-implantation\ngroupings of CDaCI participants.\nLanguage learning\nLanguage can be defined as “an internalized, abstract\nknowledge that is the basis for communication ” and\nfunctions as “a window on thought” (Jackendoff 1994).\nLanguage provides the tools to reveal ourselves to others in\nestablishing and maintaining relationships and drives\nperceptual learning that contributes to cognition.\nLanguage arises through successive, organizational\nadaptations. Thus, the study of how children learn a\nlanguage brings together myriad influences and activities\nthat enable a child to become linguistically engaged\n(Mellon 2009). Children learn spoken language by devel-\noping through knowledge and skills based in the phonology\nof the sound system, semantics (meaning), the rules of\ngrammar, and the pragmatics of interaction (Rescorla and\nMirak 1997). A child’s eventual mastery of language entails\na timely convergence of the systems of skills. Mastery in\neach system contributes to full communicative competence\n(Rice 1989) as language acquisition flows from the effects\nof relative success in one sphere (e.g., phonology) on others\n(e.g., vocabulary, morphosyntax, and pragmatics).\nEarly stages of language learning require a child to\nextract acoustic representations from speech streams.\nThrough such experiences, a child discovers regularities\nthat enable meaning and insight into grammatical rules of\nspoken language. A typical infant’s first year’s experience\nentails behavioral and innate perceptual abilities that\nprovide a framework for later acquisition of language.\nBecause speech production is not yet manifest, infants and\nyoung toddlers with SNHL are likely to go undiagnosed\nduring this period and hence may remain isolated from\nearly linguistic experience (Marschark1997). Unfortunately,\nthe delay in exposure to appropriate language models is often\nreflected in poor language outcomes (Yoshinaga-Itano et al.\n1998). Age of acquisition affects language outcomes\nregardless of modality. Both signed and spoken languages\nappear subject to timing constraints for optimal learning\n(Mayberry and Fischer1989\n;N e w p o r t1988, 1990;P a d d e n\nand Ramsey 1998). If language is introduced after this\nperiod, deaf children typically must be painstakingly taught\nlanguage instead of the experience-based acquisition lan-\nguage that characterizes typical development (Bench1992).\nAs this process is less efficient, most hearing-impaired\nchildren will be unable to fully overcome the linguistic,\nsocial, and cognitive challenges associated with delayed\nexposure to language (Vernon and Wallrabenstein 1984;\nVaccari and Marschark1997).\nCochlear implants can improve access to ambient\nlanguage but are usually provided at ages after early\ndevelopment stages for the domains of language have\nbegun. For example, ordinarily, a toddler of 3 years\nunderstands three fourths of the vocabulary that will\nultimately support his daily conversation (White 1979).\nBy age 4, most children have achieved sufficient mastery of\nthe phonological, grammatical, and pragmatic systems to be\nconsidered a native speakers or signers (Crystal1997).\nEpigenetic background\nThe human cortex has substantial potential for epigenetic\nmodification of function (Panksepp J. 2000;S u ra n d\n390 J Neurodevelop Disord (2011) 3:388–404\nLeamey 2001). An example comes from studies of the\nrodent visual system demonstrating that vision can be\nrescued following removal of the visual cortex in utero\npossibly due to the epigenetic modifications that reorganize\nthe surrounding parietal cortex, which then takes on a\nvisual function (Horng and Sur 2006). Similarly, human\nstudies have demonstrated the ability to recover fundamen-\ntal aspects of vision in congenitally blind adults who have\ntheir vision restored (Ostrovsky et al. 2009; Mandavilli\n2006). The same phenomenon has been observed in the\nauditory system, where cortical reorganization compensates\nfor alterations induced by cochlear dysfunction (Rajan et al.\n1993; McDermott et al.1998). We can extract from this the\npossibility that cortical functions, including the encoding of\nsound that subserves spoken language acquisition, are\nmodified by epigenetic modifications (Sur and Rubenstein\n2005). Auditory information is initially collected by the\nexternal ear and transmitted through the middle ear to the\ninner ear where the information is converted from vibra-\ntions in the cochlea to electrical signals in the auditory\nnerve. We are born with a developed cochlea, and brain\nprocessing of information from the cochlea develops\nsubstantially in postnatal periods (Gordon et al. 2008).\nThis period of CNS modification entails adjustments that\nare likely guided by a combination of environmental\nexposure and epigenetic expression.\nDuring postnatal development of the central nervous\nsystem, synaptogenesis plays a key role in learning and\nsynaptic connectivity is the primary neuronal correlate of\nthe representation of knowledge within the brain (Elman et\nal. 1996; Kral and Eggermont 2007). During this period,\ncognitive development is determined largely by experience\nas gene expression specifies the function and ultimate fate\nof neurons and their synaptic connectivity. With changes in\nsynaptic number and patterns of connectivity, inputs to\ncortical regions and thalamic nuclei and modulatory\ncontrols are established. Such connections transmit neuro-\nchemicals implicated in states of arousal and reward. While\nsuch models fail to account for a lockstep table of correlates\nbetween language learning and correlates of neuronal\nconnectivity, we can infer that certain stages of neuro-\ndevelopment set the stage of time-sensitive readiness for\nlearning based on perception and amenability to experience-\ndriven change (wherein learning itself contributes to the\ncomplexity of brain structure).\nExamination of the transcription factors involved in\nsynaptic modification have demonstrated the important\nepigenetic role of chromatin in neuronal function as well\nas the function of transcriptional programs that ultimately\ndirect synaptic maturation, the definitive regulator of\nsensitive periods (Hong et al.2005). Genome-wide analy-\nses suggest, for example, that the activity-dependent,\nubiquitously expressed transcription factor MEF2 regulates\na transcriptional program in neurons that controls synapse\ndevelopment (Flavell et al.2008). The role of interneurons\nand their associated proteins has also been discussed in the\nregulation of these periods (Morishita and Hensch2008).\nThe postnatal environment appears to have a large impact\non the length of sensitive periods for development. For\nexample, when rodents are separated from their mothers but\nsubsequently put in an enriched environment, the effects of\nseparation (e.g., stress res ponses and poor cognitive\nperformance) are normalized (Mohammed et al. 1993;\nNithianantharajah and Hannan 2006). This reversal sug-\ngests the ability of appropriate environmental cues to\npromote epigenetic changes that rescue normal cognitive\nfunction (Francis et al.2002; Hannigan et al.2007). The\nenvironmental impact on cognitive function and learning\nability is also evident in rodent studies. Socially enriched\nenvironments increase exploration of novel environments\nas well as the rate of conditioning whether the rats spent\ntime with biological or foster mothers (Kiyono et al.1985;\nDell and Rose1987).\nCaregivers, especially mothers, have extended prenatal and\npostnatal interactions with their children with direct implica-\ntions for behavioral phenotype. During gestation and after\nbirth, maternal health status and care of offspring has\nsubstantial effects on exploration of novel situations and\ngeneralized social behavior (Weinstock2005;M a r t i n - G r o n e r t\nand Ozanne2006\n;M e a n e y2001; Chapman and Scott2001;\nParker 1989; Pederson et al. 1998; Vanijzendoorn 1995).\nInterestingly, higher levels of parenting stress have also been\ndocumented in hearing parents of deaf toddlers and\npreschoolers (Quittner et al.2010).\nStudies of licking and grooming behaviors in rodents\noffer evidence for nongenomic transmission. This behav-\nioral repertoire is acquired through the maternal care of\noffspring (Weaver et al. 2004; Champagne et al. 2003a;\nFleming et al. 2002). Cross-fostering studies of rodents\ndemonstrate plasticity in these generational trends and\nindicate that the phenotype arises from environmental\nexposure rather than genetic predetermination (Maestripieri\net al. 2005). Even though genetics are not fundamentally\naltered, persistent behavioral changes continue into adult-\nhood and are observed to be associated with neurobiolog-\nical modifications such as oxytocin receptor density — a\nmarker that correlates with rodent licking and grooming\n(Champagne 2008; Champagne et al.2003b).\nMultiple mechanisms by which epigenetics can influ-\nence development of cortical regions have been identified\nand more are likely to be found. For example, DNA\nmethylation is a heritable modification of genomic DNA.\nPatterns of DNA methylation may play a large role in\ncontrolling development, imprinting, transcriptional regula-\ntion, chromatin structure, and overall genomic stability\n(Okano et al. 1999; Strathdee and Brown2002). Methyl-\nJ Neurodevelop Disord (2011) 3:388–404 391\nation can prevent access of transcription factors and RNA\npolymerase to DNA as well as attract protein complexes\nwhich act to silence genes (Strathdee and Brown2002).\nQuantitative assessment of DNA methylation levels suggest\nthat DNA methylation signatures distinguish brain regions\nand may help account for region-specific, functional\nspecialization (Ladd-Acosta et al.2007). This model offers\none mechanism wherein phenotypic plasticity is manifest—\ncell’s ability to change their behavior in response to internal\nor external environmental cues (Feinberg2007).\nEpigenetic models of learning\nEpigenetic models offer paradigms for understanding the\nacquisition of a skill set that is shaped by ongoing learning\nwherein learning itself affects the subsequent ability to\nlearn something new. One application of such a model\ndescribes the “cognitive development” of robots that learn\nthrough a developmental algorithm. Emergent, self-\nprogramming allows a robot to continuously expand its\nfunctional capacity based on experiences by previously\nacquired skills (Pfeifer et al.2007). Here, robotic operation\nis guided by a software program (or ‘genome’) that is\ninherently modifiable by developmental experiences (cre-\nating an ‘epigenome’). The overall result is a model of\nlearning in which learning itself affects the later capacity of\nthe brain to acquire new information.\nThree components are considered necessary for a robot\nto accomplish ongoing, emergent abilities: (1) abstractions—\nto focus attention on relevant inputs, (2) anticipation— to\npredict environmental change, and (3) self-motivation— to\npush beyond extant capacity toward more complex under-\nstanding (Blank et al.2005). Such models of robotic learning\nhave been used to model infant –caregiver interactions\n(Breazeal and Scassellati 2000), as well as language\ndevelopment (Cangelosi and Riga 2011). Robotic models\nreveal how the principles of language development and\nepigenetics can be successfully merged. Both the environ-\nment and innate factors contribute to one another in a\ndynamic fashion to promote language learning through\nbiological motivation, multidimensional experiences, and as\ninfluences from bidirectional interactions.\nMultivariable analyses of language learning after early\ncochlear implantation\nThe CDaCI study has followed 188 children with SNHL\nwho received cochlear implants at six collaborating sites\nand a control group of 97 normal hearing children who\nwere recruited from early elementary schools affiliated with\ntwo of the cochlear implant programs (Fink et al.2007).\nC h i l d r e nw e r er e c r u i t e dt ot h es t u d yi n2 0 0 2–2004.\nParticipant’s raw scores and age-normed level of compre-\nhension and expression of spoken language comprise the\nprimary outcome variables assessed by the CDaCI study.\nSecondary outcome variables relate to measures of hearing\nand speech recognition, cognitive and psychosocial devel-\nopment, and participating families ’ perception of their\nchild’s developmental progress.\nCharacteristics of the CDaCI participants are described\nelsewhere (Fink et al.2007). The etiology of hearing loss\nwas unclear in a large minority of the 188 children with\nSNHL who received cochlear implants and genetic testing\nis unavailable. However, a majority of the participants were\ndiagnosed at birth with a severe-to-profound SNHL (n=\n116) and these children\n’s results to date form the focus of\nthis report.\nSpeech recognition\nSpeech recognition, a direct measure of the auditory benefit\nof the cochlear implant, has been evaluated with hierarchi-\ncal measures that compare implanted children with aged-\nmatched children with normal hearing (Eisenberg et al.\n2006; Wang et al.2008). Children with CIs have demon-\nstrated progress in speech identification within a single year\nof implantation and approached testing levels seen in\nnormal hearing controls. Though there was a high degree\nof variability, some children were able to identity sentences\neven when perceptual demands were increased by a\nsemantic distractor.\nThe advent of bilateral cochlear implantation has\nemerged since the CDaCI study was launched in 2002. In\nthe hopes of achieving the benefits of binaural hearing\n(directional hearing and improved understanding of speech\nin noise), bilateral implants have now been placed in 40%\nof children in the CDaCI study. Early data indicate that\nbilateral CI hearing confers significant advantages in\nemergent speech recognition and in language learning\n(Niparko et al. 2010). These initial results set up further\nlongitudinal study of higher order outcomes that rely on\nrestored access to acoustic–phonetic inputs in unilateral v.\nbilateral implant conditions. Specifically with respect to\nbilateral inputs, emerging evidence indicates that speech is\nprocessed bilaterally in auditory cortical areas and that\ncritical, complementary analyses of the speech signal are\ncarried out across the hemispheres to enable beam-forming\nand other higher order processing (Poeppel2003; Millman\net al.2011). It will be important to understand the potential\nfor bilateral implants to entrain such processing.\nSpoken language outcomes\nBoth comprehension and expression of spoken language are\nimportant markers of parent-perceived success of a CI\n392 J Neurodevelop Disord (2011) 3:388–404\n(Geers et al.2008). The development of auditory process-\ning is a developmental prerequisite of the phonological\nlearning that subserves the acquisition of spoken language.\nThe ability to recognize speech represents an integration of\nsensory, linguistic, and cognitive processes that involve\nacoustic–phonetic identification and lexical access from\nmemory. When hearing is degraded by early-onset senso-\nrineural hearing loss, the ability to make the fine acoustic–\nphonetic distinctions is compromised. Cochlear implant\ncandidates evaluated in the CDaCI study are children\nwhose level of sensorineural hearing loss did not allow\nfor growth in spoken language despite the use of hearing\naids. Reports that detail the trajectory of development of\nauditory processing capacity after cochlear implantation in\nthe CDaCI study have been published elsewhere (Eisenberg\net al. 2006; Wang et al.2008).\nIn the present analysis, children were first stratified into\ntwo subgroups based on whether they had developed some\nspoken language skills, defined as having a comprehension\nor expression standard score ≥70 from the Reynell\nDevelopmental Language Scales (RDLS; Reynell and\nGruber 1990) evaluated at baseline (before implantation).\nChildren who had not yet developed significant spoken\nlanguage skills at baseline were further stratified based on\nthe age when their cochlear implants were activated. Table1\nlists characteristics of the 116 children assessed in this\nreport. In the first column, characteristics and associations\nin 20 of the 116 children with measurable language (based\non Reynell Language test results≥70) at baseline (prior to\nCI) are listed. Columns 2 and 3 of Table 1 list the\ncharacteristics of children whose implant was activated at\n<18 months (n=34) and >18 months (n=62), respectively,\nall of whom had no measurable spoken language at\nbaseline.\nTable 2 presents results from 116 CDaCI study children\nwith congenital SNHL evaluated with the Comprehensive\nAssessment of Spoken Language (CASL) metric at 4 –\n5 years after implant activation. Fifteen core tests comprise\nthe full CASL (Carrow-Woolfolk 1999) assessing four\nlanguage structure categories: Lexical/Semantic, Syntactic,\nSupralinguistic, and Pragmatic in receptive and expressive\nformat, through the age of 21 years. Four core tests are age-\nappropriate for CDaCI participants assessed 4–5 years after\nimplantation: Antonyms, Syntax Construction, Paragraph\nComprehension of Syntax, and Pragmatic Judgment. The\nAntonyms test assesses the l exical/semantic aspect of\nlanguage development through measuring the retrieval of\nspoken single words and the oral vocabulary needed to\nproduce them. Thus, performance on the Antonyms test\ndepends on both receptive and expressive oral vocabulary.\nThe Pragmatic Judgment test evaluates the pragmatics of\nlanguage development in both receptive and expressive\nformat, while the Paragraph Comprehension of Syntax and\nSyntax Construction tests measure the syntactic aspects of\nreceptive and expressive language, respectively. A core\ncomposite score based on results of these four age-\nappropriate core tests is also examined in Table2.\nAfter 4–5 years of implant use, the subgroup of children\nwho acquired some spoken language skills at baseline\nbefore implantation, regardless of when they received and\nactivated their cochlear implants, showed significantly\nhigher average scores in all four language subdomains than\nTable 1 Baseline characteristics of 116 young children with congenital hearing loss who received cochlear implants before 5 years of age in the\nChildhood Development after Cochlear Implantation (CDaCI) study\nBaseline factors With measurable spoken language\ndevelopment at baselinea (N=20)\nCI activated <18 months\nof age (N=34)\nCI activated ≥18 months\nof age (N=62)\nMean Standard\ndeviation\nMean Standard\ndeviation\nMean Standard\ndeviation\nP value\nAge at CI activation, years 2.23 1.24 1.15 0.17 2.88 1.03 <0.0001\nLength of hearing loss without\namplification, years\n0.43 0.26 0.34 0.25 1.18 0.71 <0.0001\nLength of hearing loss with\namplification, years\n1.55 1.20 0.57 0.24 1.49 1.22 0.0001\nResidual hearing, 4 frequency\npure tone average\n94.69 14.18 110.66 16.07 107.10 15.10 0.0011\nMaternal sensitivity, point 5.54 0.37 5.40 0.79 5.12 0.71 0.032\nN % N % N % P value\nFemale 14 70.0 14 41.2 37 60.0 0.08\nNonwhite race 2 10.0 4 11.8 20 32.3 0.02\nHispanics 3 15.0 3 8.8 20 32.3 0.02\nFamily income, less than\n$50,000 per year\n4 20.0 7 20.6 35 56.5 0.0004\na Comprehension or expression standard score from the Reynell Developmental Language Scales (RDLS)≥70 at baseline\nJ Neurodevelop Disord (2011) 3:388–404 393\nsubgroups who had no measurable language at baseline and\nwere activated after 18 months of age (Table2).

Of\nnote, hearing variables, maternal sensitivity, and SES were\nfactors that carried variable predictive value for perfor-\nmance outcome as measured for the core composite across\nthe three groups of children assessed.\nIn agreement with prior single-center and convenience\nsampled studies, CDaCI results have revealed that the CI\nproduces consistent effects in improving the trajectory of\nspoken language learning and that age of implantation is a\nsignificant predictor of the level of spoken language skills\nacquired (Niparko et al.2010; Tobey et al.2011). Children\nwho received their implants before 18 months of age\nexhibit language performance scores that remained roughly\nwithin 1 standard deviation of their normal hearing peers,\nwhile children who were older at the time of implantation\nexhibit significantly larger gaps between their language\nscores and the scores predicted by their chronological age,\nboth at baseline and over the periods of 3 (Niparko et al.\n2010) to 6 years (Tobey et al.2011) after a CI is placed.\nObservations of superior language development that are\nassociated with earlier access to speech information are\nconsistent with concepts of optimal periods for auditory-\nbased learning, which suggest that early auditory exposure\nis necessary for neuronal commitment to support the\nauditory processing of complex signals (Kral2007). While\nthese results demonstrate clear advantage of early treat-\nment, the prospects for such neurodevelopmental deficits to\nrecover will require furth er longitudinal assessment\n(Ehninger et al.2008).\nThese observations lend support to a mode of language\ndevelopment that emphasizes the importance of period-\nsensitive, auditory-based learning. Deaf children who gain\nearly auditory exposure in an early, optimal periods show\nimproved subsequent language development relative to deaf\nchildren with reduced early auditory exposure before hearing\nis electrically restored, and even more so than those deaf\nchildren whose auditory capacity is restored toward the end or\noutside of such an optimal period. These observations are\nconsistent with observations that early auditory exposure is\nnecessary for neuronal commitment to support the auditory\nprocessing of complex signals (Kral2007).\nEnvironmental factors play a measurable role in early\nlanguage learning as revealed in CDaCI data (Niparko et al.\n2010). Annual family income of less than $50,000 was\nassociated with lower average standard scores across\nsubdomains with the strongest association observed for\nthe Antonyms scores ( p<0.01), while associations with\nother subdomains did not reach statistical significance after\nmultivariable adjustment. This observation is consistent\nwith previous CDaCI studies wherein significantly reduced\nlanguage learning rates associate with lower socioeconomic\nstatus (SES) (Niparko et al. 2010). These findings are\nconsistent with prior studies that suggest that children from\nlower SES homes are exposed to a narrower range of\nlanguage due to reduced parental attention and talking\n(Walker et al. 1994; Hart and Risley 1995). Children in\nlower SES households receive less encouragement to talk\nand ultimately experienced deficits in language and\nacademic performance when they enter school.\nTable 3 Multivariable-adjusted (adjusted for all other variables in the\ntable and further adjusted for gender, race, and ethnicity) mixed effects\nmodeling analyses for core composite of the Comprehensive Assess-\nment of Spoken Language (CASL) acquired after 4 to 5 years of\nexperience with cochlear implant among 116 young children with\ncongenital hearing loss\nBaseline factors associated with\nchange in standard scores\nWith measurable spoken\nlanguage development at\nbaseline\na\nCI activated <18 months\nof age\nCI activated ≥18 months\nof age\nEstimate Standard error P value Estimate Standard error P value Estimate Standard error P value\nResidual hearing, per 20 dB\nincrease in 4 frequency pure\ntone average\n−9.11 5.49 0.1256 −2.07 3.00 0.4971 −3.61 2.86 0.2136\nLength of hearing loss without\namplification, per 6 months\nincrease\n21.08 4.43 0.0006 −16.81 6.15 0.0114 2.71 1.47 0.0715\nLength of hearing loss with\namplification, per 6 months\nincrease\n0.56 1.35 0.6880 −2.13 8.21 0.7970 −0.32 1.04 0.7579\nMaternal sensitivity, per point\nincrease\n1.11 6.47 0.8665 13.78 4.31 0.0037 10.01 2.49 0.0002\nFamily income, less than $50,000\nper year\n−33.65 6.98 0.0005 −11.89 7.26 0.1140 −2.82 4.31 0.5162\na Comprehension or expression standard score from the Reynell Developmental Language Scales (RDLS)≥70 at baseline\nJ Neurodevelop Disord (2011) 3:388–404 395\nTogether, these data indicate that outcomes differ after\nthe introduction of electrical hearing with a CI as modified\nby a range of factors related to hearing and environmental\nexperience.

Since\nthe subgroups had smaller sample sizes, it is not practical to\ninclude as many variables as in larger analytic models\n(Niparko et al.2010). Trends observed may have also been\nsubject to floor effects of the measured language perfor-\nmance results.\nCognitive and psychosocial development\nEarly childhood deafness has been associated with dis-\nruptions in the development of cognitive processes related\nto focusing attention. Studies of deaf children with both\nhearing aids and cochlear implants have consistently\ndocumented deficits in visual, selective attention (Smith et\nal. 1998; Quittner and Opipari 1994), with concomitant\nincreases in externalizing behavior problems (Mitchell and\nQuittner 1996; Carr and Durand1985). These findings are\ncounterintuitive since the visual system develops normally\nin this population and better visual attention would be\nadaptive for interpreting signs or other forms of visual\ncommunication. This is likely due to a lack of integration of\nthe visual and auditory systems early in brain development\nand the need for the young deaf child to“monitor” his/her\nenvironment visually rather than auditorally (Smith et al.\n1998). Two studies have now shown that cochlear implants\nare associated with improvements in visual, selective\nattention (Smith et al. 1998; Quittner et al. 2008); in the\nCDaCI study, improvements in visual tracking and attention\nwere among the earliest, positive effects of cochlear\nimplantation (Quittner et al.2008).\nA key domain assessed by the CDaCI study is the\nparticipant’s cognitive, social, and emotional development\nas it relates to language acquisition. For example, one\nCDaCI study has reported on the development of symbolic\nplay in both deaf and hearing children, using videotaped\nassessments of play without adult mediation (Quittner et al.\n2011). In typically developing children, language emerges\nin parallel with the use of symbols in play (e.g., using a peg\nto represent a person). Because these two skills develop in\nsynchrony, it is difficult to determine whether they reflect a\ncommon, underlying ability or whether some level of\nlanguage is needed to facilitate symbolic representation\n(Thal and Bates 1989). Results indicate that at baseline,\ndeaf CDaCI participants were delayed in achieving sym-\nbolic play when compared to hearing children. However,\nrestoration of auditory input with cochlear implantation in\nchildren before the age of 2 was associated with greater\nachievement of symbolic play and was similar to hearing\ncontrols. Furthermore, growth of oral language was\npositively and significantly associated with the acquisition\nof symbolic play in deaf children using cochlear implants.\nEvidence across a variety of studies indicates that\nsignificant disruptions may occur in parent–child interac-\ntions among hearing mothers of infants and toddlers with\nSNHL (Meadow-Orlans et al. 1997; Musselman and\nKircaali-Iftar 1996; Quittner et al. 1990; Quittner et al.\n2010). Observational studies have shown that, relative to\nmothers in either hearing or deaf dyads, hearing mothers of\ndeaf children tend to be more controlling in their verbal and\nnonverbal interactions (Musselman and Churchill 1991),\nspend less time in coordinated joint attention with the child\n(Waxman et al.1996), and have greater difficulty respond-\ning to the child’s emotional and behavioral cues (Swisher\n2010). The consequences of such disruptions may include\nless secure attachment, difficulties sustaining attention and\nexerting behavioral control, and slower development of\ncommunicative competence (Reivich and Rothrock 1972;\nBornstein 1990; Quittner et al.2004; Lederberg et al.2000;\nSpencer et al.1991).\nEarly in development, the quality of parent –child\ninteractions is a key source of emotional attachment,\nscaffolding the development of communicative, cognitive\nand behavioral skills (Vygotsky et al.1972; Bakeman and\nAdamson 1984; Sroufe et al.1999). Quality of parent–child\ninteractions has been shown to provide a critical foundation\nfor overall development. In the NICHD Early Childcare\nStudy, a nationally representative, hearing sample of\nchildren followed from birth through late adolescence,\nmaternal sensitivity was a critical predictor of children’s\ncognitive, social, and behavioral development (NICHD\n1999). Maternal sensitivity is a construct which measures\nwarmth, positive regard and respect for autonomy in the\nparent–child relationship. In the CDaCI study, maternal\nsensitivity was measured in videotaped structured and\nunstructured tasks. At baseline, mothers of deaf children\nwere less “sensitive” in their interactions with their deaf\nchildren than mothers of hearing children. Furthermore,\nmaternal sensitivity was significantly associated with better\ngrowth in language learning, after controlling for SES and\nother child characteristics (Niparko et al.2010; Quittner et\nal. 2011). As shown in Tables2–3, regardless of subgroups,\nhigher maternal sensitivity to the communication needs of a\ndeaf child at baseline is significantly associated with greater\nspoken language development to a similar degree across all\nfour CASL subdomains.\nRaising a deaf child is associated with significant\nparental stress due to the substantial long-term chal-\n396 J Neurodevelop Disord (2011) 3:388–404\nlenges of communication, education, and health care\n(Lederberg and Golbach 2002). Consistent with obser-\nvations of the disruptive effects of SNHL, Barker et al.\n(2009) observed within the CDaCI cohort of deaf children\nsignificant behavioral problems as measured on the well-\nvalidated Child Behavioral Checklist at baseline. As\nlanguage skills improved, behavior problems diminished\nover the 3 years of longitudinal measurement (Romero\n2001). Furthermore, high levels of parenting stress are\nassociated with poor social and emotional development as\nwell as increased behavioral problems (Crnic et al.2002).\nParents in the CDaCI study experienced increased\ncontext-specific stress asso ciated with raising a child\nw i t hh e a r i n gi m p a i r m e n tw h e nc o m p a r e dt oh e a r i n g\nparents (Quittner et al. 2010). Higher levels of parenting\nstress were also negatively related to language develop-\nment in the deaf sample. Language skills are likely to\naffect interactions between children and their parents\nbecause: (1) language facilitates children’s regulation of\nattention, emotion, and behavior, and (2) language skills\nfacilitates communication wit h parents, enabling better\ninteractions and reduced levels of family stress (Quittner\net al. 2010).\nGiven the impact of such disruptions, a parent ’s\nperception of their child’s progress in development would\nseem to be a key predictor of active engagement with post-\nimplant rehabilitation. Lin et al. ( 2008) studied the\nassociation between several commonly used outcome\ninstruments and a measure of parental perceptions of\ndevelopment to gain insight into how our clinical tests\nreflect parental perceptions of a child ’s developmental\nstatus. Associations between parental attitude and clinical\noutcomes were subject to child-age variations, but outcome\nmeasures were positively associated with parental percep-\ntions of development, with the most robust associations\nshowed positive correlations with measures of spoken\nlanguage.\nThe CDaCI study continues to measure parents’ annual\nratings of their child’s global health-related quality of life\n(HRQoL) and developmental status using visual analog\nscales (Fink et al. 2007). Results to date parallel those\nrelated to the general level of functioning across WHO\nbased ageappropriate domains (Clark et al.2011). Longi-\ntudinal surveys indicate that the developmental deficits of\nchildren who were CI candidates compared to NH children,\nare improved across the cohort 3 years after CI, with the\ngreatest improvement observed in deaf children implanted\nbefore 18 months of age. Such parental perspectives on\nHRQoL and development provide practical insight into the\noptimal timing of interventions for early-onset deafness,\nespecially in the context of parental expectations of their\nchild’s ability to effectively acquire spoken language after a\nCI.\nDiscussion\nIn the CDaCI study, we have observed the effects of an\napparent sensitive period such that greater benefit for\nspoken language acquisition after a CI is significantly\nassociated with earlier implantation. Based in this prospec-\ntive dataset, significantly greater trajectory of spoken\nlanguage learning occurs in children implanted in infant\nand early toddler stages relative to implantation in later\ntoddler stages. Outcomes, however, are significantly mod-\nified by a range of factors based in a child’s pre- and post-\nimplant experience. Our observations are consistent with a\ngrowing body of evidence that epigenetic modification of\nthe CNS subserves periods for learning of complex tasks\nsuch as those related to learning the subsystems of spoken\nlanguage and ultimately are important in, if not definitive\nof, effective language comprehension and expression.\nSensitive periods in the development of auditory cortex\nterminate with reductions in overall synaptic activity and\nare associated with an inability to completely restore\nhearing function (Kral2007). Changes in synaptic plasticity\nare likely due to genetic timing of brain sensitivity to\nlanguage combined with epigenetic features that are guided\nby the availability of adequate sensory input (Kral2007\n;\nPanksepp 2008). Though the closure of a sensitive period\nthat occurs without development of auditory circuits is\nevident in cat models of congenital deafness, exposure to\nauditory stimuli by means of cochlear implantation appears\ncapable of producing evoked potentials in more cortical\nareas, at higher amplitudes, and with the longer latency\nresponses that resemble those of normal-hearing cats\n(Klinke et al. 1999). This suggests the ability of cochlear\nimplantation to restore or potentially preserve normal\nauditory input to cortical areas. EEG studies of auditory-\nevoked potentials have also demonstrated normal latencies\nof cortical responses in children implanted (CI), but only if\nthey received an implant before 3.5 years of age, suggesting\na watershed age of implantation that affects the capacity for\ncortical processing (Sharma et al.2007).\nTwo key observations are of interest to the development\nof an epigenetic model of spoken language development\nwhen hearing restoration with a CI is pursued: (1) elements\nof the language system (e.g., phonetics, vocabulary,\ngrammar, and pragmatics) appear to be differentially\naffected by delayed exposure to spoken language and by\nmodifying factors, and (2) delayed exposure can cause\ndisruptions in the social/affective process of parentally\nguided language learning.\nThe significance of sensitive periods within this model\ncomes from the possibility of a CI to restore normal\nauditory learning capacity in the context of cortical\nplasticity. We observed trends of dissociation between the\ndomains of vocabulary and receptive syntax vs. expressive\nJ Neurodevelop Disord (2011) 3:388–404 397\nsyntax, with implantation prior to 18 months having a\nlarger positive impact on the development of receptive and\nexpressive syntax than on vocabulary acquisition. Impor-\ntantly, children who received a CI prior to 18 months of age\nalso demonstrate relatively strong development of expres-\nsive syntax and pragmatic use of spoken language;\nimplantation at later stages of toddler development was\nassociated with vulnerabilities in pragmatics and expressive\nsyntax. Though generally highly associated in their devel-\nopmental patterns (Bates and Dick2002), impaired acqui-\nsition of grammar relative to vocabulary has previously\nbeen noted in deaf children, suggesting the potential for\ndifferential development across the subdomains of spoken\nlanguage (Tomblin et al.2007).\nChildren with hearing loss possess specific deficits in\ngrammar development that are similar to children with\nspecific language impairment, demonstrating that such\ngrammar-specific deficits can be observed in children with\ncortical neurosystems that developed in the presence of\nnormal auditory inputs (Norbury et al.2001; Briscoe et al.\n2001; Watkins and Rice1994). These results suggest that,\nin children with hearing loss, normally linked dimensions\nof language can become dissociated from one another. The\naspects of learning specifically associated with grammar\nmust be analyzed to understand the basis for this\ndissociation.\nAs events in the real world generally result in the\nstimulation of multiple sensory modalities (e.g., auditory\nand visual), it is important to consider that developmental\noutcomes may reflect interactions between the auditory\nsystem and other sensory modalities (Kral et al. 2000).\nMultisensory integration can be thought of in terms of\nsalience— the ability of a stimulus to capture attention.\nMultisensory inputs may en hance the salience of a\nparticular stimulus that would have otherwise evaded\ndetection and subsequent response. These interactions are\ntherefore most relevant when a stimulus has low salience\n(Calvert et al.2001). Detecting and subsequent learning of\nthe rules of grammar relies on attention to the more subtle\n“little words” and (morphosyntactic) endings of words and\nphrases (Bates and Dick 2002). Thus, reduced access to\nacoustic–phonetic cues may inhibit the natural attentional\nenhancement of grammatical cues (Dick et al.2001; Singer\nHarris et al.1997).\nHaving considered the importance of multisensory\nintegration of auditory and visual cues, we can consider\nits relationship to sensitive periods. Though auditory\nperception is restored with cochlear implantation, these\nco-activated processes in deaf children demonstrate a bias\ntoward visual rather than auditory stimuli (Bergeson et al.\n2005). The persistence of a visual bias suggests that\nmultisensory integration may not develop normally when\na single sense dominates in early development. Auditory\nstimulation in an early sensitive period may, therefore, be\nnecessary to ensure adequate influence on central circuits\nthat enable multisensory integration. Cochlear implantation\nwithin the first year of life may rescue these circuits and\nenable matching of auditory and visual cues (Bergeson et\nal. 2010). Evidence for this comes from an examination of\nimplanted congenitally deaf children who were more likely\nto fuse auditory and visual information processing if they\nreceived their cochlear implant within 2.5 years of age\n(Schorr et al. 2005). This observation reinforces the idea\nthat early, effective auditory stimulation is necessary to\nestablish multisensory connections and preserve the atten-\ntional resources necessary for learning in the subdomains of\nspoken language.\nOur observations suggest evidence that the auditory\nsystem communicates with the visual system in circuits that\nare established early on and affect learning within language\nsubdomains. Detection and learning of grammar requires\nmultisensory interactions due to the low perceptual salience\nof grammatical cues. We suggest that, unlike vocabulary,\ngrammar substantially improved for the group of CI who\nreceived implants prior to 18 months because the early\nactivation of auditory cortex was able to rescue the\ndevelopment of multisensory integration circuits that\nultimately amplified the salience of grammatical cues.\nObservations gained from the CDaCI study can also be\nconsidered in the context of an epigenetic perspective by\nconsidering the multiple ways a child interacts with her\nenvironment, specifically the impact of limited verbal\nlanguage on parent–child interactions. The development of\nlanguage necessitates and derives from encounters with the\nworld through childhood (Panksepp 2008). The affective\ncomponents of these experiences have a measurable impact\non the trajectory that language development follows. Joy\nfrom play, nurturance from care, and panic from separation\ndistress are just a few of the many emotional aspects of the\nrelationship between the mother and child that shape\nlanguage development (Schore 2003; Trevarthen 2001).\nSuch experiences associate with a child’s desire to engage\nwith the world in an exploratory fashion, which is\ninevitably accompanied by exposure to a diverse range of\nsounds, including utterance material (Panksepp 2008).\n“Motherese,” the high-pitched, melodic, and repetitive form\nof speech with exaggerated intonation, appears well-suited\nfor the acquisition of language (Fernald1989; Trevarthen\nand Aitken 2001). While this form of the speech has been\nknown to engage infants, it further appears that it typifies\nthe affective bond shared between mother and child and\nplausibly promotes profound neurobiological changes to\nsupport the development of language.\nAspects of motivation are critical to an understanding of\na model by which epigenetic changes are associated with\nparental nurturing to promote the development of spoken\n398 J Neurodevelop Disord (2011) 3:388–404\nlanguage (MacLean 1990). Self-motivation is highly asso-\nciated with activity of the anterior cingulate regions that\nappear to enact social–emotional response. Activity within\nthese regions associates both with experience of separation\ndistress and the formation of social bonds (Panksepp2003).\nInterestingly, bilateral damage to the same regions results in\nakinetic mutism, a deficit of language despite adequate\nmotor function (Devinsky et al.1995). This suggests the\npotential of these regions to “gate” interactions between\naffective interactions during childhood and development of\nlifelong language skills. Though neocortical regions ulti-\nmately process linguistic information, it is important to note\nthat non-linguistic areas can provide attention and motiva-\ntion in promoting, or inhibiting, language-associated activ-\nities (Panksepp 2008).\nRecent discoveries in molecular genetics have begun to\nelucidate the patterns of genetic expression that underlay\nemergent CNS circuitry that supports language learning.\nFor example, one gene that has been implicated in language\n(FOXP2) is concentrated in the basal ganglia. Evidence\nfrom songbirds suggests that this gene’s product may be\nnecessary for trial and error vocal learning (Scharff and\nHaesler 2005; Ölveczky et al.2005). Motivation to pursue\ntrial and error for such exploration is essential for acquiring\nlanguage and is likely dependent on encouragement derived\nfrom supportive, affective social interactions. Preliminary\nevidence suggests that FOXP2 may impact neuronal\nplasticity in an epigenetic fashion. Regulating mRNAs\nsupport neurite outgrowth and synapse formation of circuits\nthat are involved in motor learning in rodents and song\nlearning in birds (Fisher and Scharff 2009; Vernes et al.\n2011). Furthermore, FOXP2 expression is associated with\nauditory inputs. Mutations in FOXP2 in rodents appear to\nspecifically affect either synchrony of synaptic transmission\nfrom the cochlea to the auditory brainstem or the activation\nof auditory nerve fibers that carry auditory information to\nthe brainstem (Kurt et al.2009).\nEpigentic modifications in these same subcortical\nregions demonstrate a possible mechanism that controls\nspecific cortical functions. Selective lesions to cholinergic\nsystem in the basal forebrain of rats results in shift from\nlong-term potentiation to long-term depression— a transi-\ntion that is accompanied with a loss of synaptic plasticity in\nthe visual cortex (Kuczweski et al.2005). Such observa-\ntions suggest mechanisms by which epigenetic modifica-\ntions may influence the dur ation of sensitive periods\n(Hanganu-Opatz 2010; van Ooyen2011).\nWe can hypothesize a basic mechanism by which\nexperience acts through epigenetic means to promote\ncortical differentiation and regulate sensitive periods. The\nresults of the CDaCI study fit well into the proposed model.\nThe maximal effect of implantation is seen in the group\nimplanted earliest, suggesting a sensitive period that begins\nto close for the other groups that experienced constrained\naccess to the key acoustic –phonetic perceptions that\nnormally initiate spoken language learning early in life.\nSelective effects on the domain of grammar highlight the\nrole that attention likely plays in the acquisition of grammar\nskills. The necessity for the environment to provide sensory\ninformation and for this information to be recognized by the\nnervous system appears to be absolute, though a critical\ntime frame exists during which intervention allows at least\npartial recovery of function. Ongoing and emerging factors\ncontribute to early development of behaviors of interest in\nthe CDaCI study, with the primary outcome variable being\nthe development of spoken language. There are important\ncontributions to language development from multiple\nsources (family, social interactions) as well as synergistic\neffects of one developing system on another (e.g., low\nlanguage level affecting behavioral organization).\nOur observations of the key role played by parent–child\ninteractions in shaping outcomes after a CI provide the\nmost powerful example of how epigenetic changes could be\nregulated by the environment. A bidirectional relationship\ncan be hypothesized between language development and\nparent\n–child interactions. In a child with SNHL, although\ninnate language systems may be intact, with a sole deficit\nlocated in the perception of sound, the child may have\neither an inadequate store of utterance material or inade-\nquate experience with meaning-interpretation experiences\nto fully engage with language tasks. A child’s cognitive\nskills, parent–child interactions, social adjustment, behav-\nioral skills, parental well-being, and social skills interact\nwithin the home milieu early on and, over time, with\ninformation in the outside environment, all are also nested\nwithin the framework of environmental experience affected\nby socioeconomics and societal influences.\nThe appropriation and command of spoken language\ndirectly help children regulate their attention, and to\ncommunicate in ways that affect emotion and behavior\nand facilitates caregiver and, later, peer communications to\nenable further refinement and nuanced use of spoken\nlanguage. When a child’s command of language is lacking,\nthe result is inevitably impairment in communication with\nparents and heightened risk of greater parental stress.\nParental perception of their child’s language skills therefore\npredictably results in a change in the way they interact.\nSuch parental interpretation of their child’s abilities and\nhow this, in turn, affects the development of further verbal\n(and written) interactions are key questions that can be\nanswered with longitudinal follow-up.\nIn the same way that a rodent raised without licking and\ngrooming undergoes epigenetic changes that ultimately\naffect behavior, one can hypothesize that a young child\ndeveloping without sufficient affective and social interac-\ntion may experience epigenetic modification that closes\nJ Neurodevelop Disord (2011) 3:388–404 399\noptimal periods by inhibiting synaptic plasticity. Consider,\nfor example, a mother who is frustrated by a perceived lack\nof language development in her child with a recent CI. Her\ninterpretation may prevent her from using“motherese” and\naggressively communicating with her child through speech\nas she otherwise would have done. Data from the CDaCI\nstudy, as well as those from field studies of hearing\nchildren, indicate that the lack of such affective stimulation\ncan stifle motivation for the child to speak and to explore novel\napplications of spoken language. Furthermore, as neurobio-\nlogical changes decrease attention directed at language,\nneurobiological observations suggest that there is likely an\nassociated diminution in synaptic plasticity that will ultimately\ninhibit future progress in language acquisition. In this model,\nthe result can be a harmful circle of poor language skills\ncausing parental stress and disappointment, with resultant\nnegative and multidimensional influences on the development\nof spoken language skills in a child with a CI.\nThis model demonstrates the clinical importance of\npromoting parental support and intervening when a com-\nmunicatively inactive home environment and parental stress\nare detected. Parents of children with hearing loss love their\nchildren and, though they seek to nurture them in different\nways, it is essential that they are encouraged to emphasize\nthe same language-based affection provided to children\nwith normal hearing. Additionally, this model provides a\nconcrete example for hypothesized environmental impact\non cortical function and plasticity. We envision multiple\nepigenetic changes, such as one regulating attention to\nlanguage based on affective social interactions, combine to\nimpact the development of higher order cognitive functions\nof spoken language after surgical intervention in deafness.\nSummary\nA convergence of the biological, cognitive, and communica-\ntion sciences potentially unifies our approach to the complex-\nities of developmental learning. Within a multidimensional,\nepigenetic framework, this report addresses childhood acqui-\nsition of spoken language after cochlear implantation— a\nprocess that represents an interplay between general learning\nmechanisms, auditory perception, and ongoing environmental\nexperience with the statistical regularities of auditory input.\nFrom such an interplay, a child gains operational insight into\nthe meaning and communicative intent conveyed by the\nsounds of speech of others.\nThe CDaCI study represents variance in naturally occurring\ncircumstances that affect language learning reflected in\ninhomogeneities in the baseline biological factors and the\nenvironments of participants. In such variability, however, are\nopportunities to identify dependent variables of clinical\nimportance in addressing how SNHL-challenged children can\nlearn to receive and produce more adequate speech and\nlanguage. CDaCI data indicate that a range of factors associate\nwith the pattern of the acquisition of spoken language skills\nafter cochlear implantation. Earlier exposure to sound via the\nCI associated with a faster rate of spoken language growth.\nPhonological, semantic, grammatical, and pragmatic develop-\nment differed with age of implantation. Such results support\nmodels of language learning that predict that with earlier onset\nof access to acoustic–phonemic inputs, growth rates in spoken\nlanguage can approach those of normal-hearing children,\nwhereas delayed access associates with slower growth rates,\nparticularly within language domains of syntax and pragmat-\nics. Multivariable analyses suggest that language learning\ninvolves complex interactions in which modifying factors vary\nin their impact on language learning with age of onset of\neffective hearing, and the impact of biological and experiential\nfactors varies with the age at which perceptual capabilities are\nintroduced via cochlear implantation. Awealth of data indicates\nthat neurodevelopmental phenomena related to language\nlearning are driven by time-sensitive, bidirectional events. If\nenvironmental cues and interaction are not provided in a timely\nmanner, developmental potentialnarrows. Conversely, Bates et\nal. (2003) have observed that brain maturation affects\nexperience, and experience returns the“favor” by altering\nbrain structure. In periods of exponential bursts that are\ncharacteristic of early languagelearning, there are compelling\ndata that underscore the role of mutually beneficial, bidirec-\ntional interactions between brain and behavior.\nKey advances will come from a fuller understanding of the\nspecific neural events that drive language acquisition, and the\ngenetic control that promotes learning from experience. For\nexample, if we are able to make deductions about epigenetic\ncontrols of brain development through an understanding of\nhow synaptogenesis and regression, synaptic refinement and\ncortical connectivity are influenced by the transmission,\nreception, and production of speech, we can inform\napproaches to rehabilitation of the child with early-onset\nSNHL to promote the remarkable achievement represented by\nspoken language development in the typical child.\nAcknowledgments This work was sponsored by the National\nInstitutes of Health, National Institute of Deafness and Other\nCommunication Disorders R01DC04797 (John K.
