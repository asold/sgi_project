  "abstract": "AI has demonstrated expertise across various fields, but its potential as a moral expert remains unclear. Recent work suggests that Large Language Models (LLMs) can reflect moral judgments with high accuracy. But as LLMs are increasingly used in complex decision-making roles, true moral expertise requires not just aligned judgments but also clear and trustworthy moral reasoning. Here, we advance work on the Moral Turing Test and find that advice from GPT-4o is rated as more moral, trustworthy, thoughtful, and correct than that of the popular The New York Times advice column, The Ethicist. GPT models outperformed both a representative sample of Americans and a renowned ethicist in providing moral explanations and advice, suggesting that LLMs have, in some respects, achieved a level of moral expertise. The present work highlights the importance of carefully programming ethical guidelines in LLMs, considering their potential to sway users' moral reasoning. More promisingly, it suggests that LLMs could complement human expertise in moral guidance and decision-making.",
