BMC Public Health          (2022) 22:530 \nBackground\nThe spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has \nput the lives in danger of many people around the world \n[1, 2]. Officially declared a pandemic, the measures to \ncontain the spread caused many businesses to lose their \nincome and the economy became uncertain. These prob -\nlems emerged quickly after the virus took over. However, \nthere is another, less obvious problem that the pandemic \ncreated.\nFor many people, the virus causes distress; for some, \nthis can take the form of impaired mental health. In the \nmonths after the discovery of the virus on 27th Decem -\nber 2019, studies already found a decline in public \nmental health [3 ]. More importantly, the virus and the \nmeasures taken to contain it may affect risk of suicide \n[4, 5]. Scientists have expressed the fear that the number \nof suicides would rise, as government policy and meas -\nures to contain it would result in unemployment, finan -\ncial stress, social isolation and loneliness [6 ]. O’Conner \net  al. observed an increase in suicidal ideation during \nthe initial weeks of the lockdown in the UK [7 ]. Fortu -\nnately, the number of suicides has not increased in the \nfirst months of the pandamic [8 , 9]. However, this does \nnot provide a complete picture of COVID-19’s impact. \nWe need to remain vigilant.\nIn what way does COVID-19 affect people with sui -\ncidal ideation? The virus introduced financial uncer -\ntainty, and social distancing became the new norm. \nPeople no longer had easy access to their social or pro -\nfessional outlets, education was disrupted, and there \nwas an increase in bereavement and traumas. With a \nlack of social interaction, adolescents are particularly \nvulnerable because they are in an important period for \nsocial and emotional development [10, 11]. Did any of \nthe pandemic’s changes contribute to a change in the \nproblems that people with suicidal behavior or ideation \nexperience?\nThe current study explores the impact of the COVID-\n19 pandemic in a specific at-risk population, i.e. help \nseekers that contact a suicide prevention helpline in the \nNetherlands (113 Suicide prevention). Suicide preven -\ntion helplines provide an accessible means of obtaining \ninformation on people who are struggling with suicidal -\nity. These helplines exist to counsel people through this \nstruggle. These help seekers with suicidal ideation can \ncontact the anonymous helpline by phone or chat. The \nchat data from these helplines can be used in combina -\ntion with natural language-processing techniques to \ngain insights into the problems of people with suicidal \nthoughts during the pandemic.\nSeveral studies have developed algorithms to detect \nchanges in text content. Blei and Lafferty, as well \nas Wang et  al. presented methods that model topic \nchanges over time [12, 13]. In the domain of suicide \nprevention, Kumar et al. used topic modeling to detect \nchanges in suicide-related content found in social \nmedia following celebrity suicides to measure their \nimpact [14]. To the best of our knowledge, no study has \nbeen conducted to apply state-of-the-art NLP within \nthe context of suicide prevention helplines.\nWith more than 100,000 conversations with help \nseekers in 2020, the chat service of the national sui -\ncide prevention helpline in the Netherlands presents \nan opportunity: these conversations can be analyzed \nduring the COVID-19 pandemic in comparison with \nthe conversations before. The potential changes can be \nobserved from the logs of the chat service.\nThis study therefore aims to identify whether the \nCOVID-19 pandemic is related to changes in suicide-\nrelated problems for help seekers on a suicide preven -\ntion helpline. A second aim is to detect changes in \nspecific risk groups, e.g. male and young help seekers \nand help seekers alone. By doing so, the current study \nmay inform suicide prevention strategies for organiza -\ntions in public and mental health that help people with \nsuicidal ideation and inform other national and inter -\nnational helplines about the application of this innova -\ntive methodology.\nTo this end, this paper intends to answer the follow -\ning questions:\n– What are the most common conversation topics of \nhelp seekers on the helpline?\n– Has the occurrence of conversation topics changed \nafter government measure for COVID-19 contain -\nment were introduced?\n– Do different demographics show different changes \nin topic occurrence?\nWhen it comes to different demographics and how \nthey are affected, we hypothesize the following: The \nfirst hypothesis is that the observed changes in topic \nusage will differ between men and women, due to men \nbeing more sensitive to social-economic change [15]. \nFurthermore, we also suspect different outcomes for \nolder and younger help seekers due to the difference in \nsocial economic impact the government measures. The \nsecond hypothesis is that the observed changes in topic \nusage will differ between people younger than 30 and \nolder than 30, since adolescents particularly are at risk \nand even before the pandemic suicide rates were rising \namong young people in certain high-income countries \n[7, 16]. Finally, due to the social isolation of a lock -\ndown, the third hypothesis is that people who live alone \nwill show different topic usage from people who don’t \nlive alone [17].\nPage 3 of 10\nSalmi et al. BMC Public Health          (2022) 22:530 \n \nMethods\nDue to the nature of helpline chat data, we conducted a \nretrospective cohort study. To answer the first question, \ntopics were extracted from the chats, using a unique \ntopic modeling method tailored to conversational data. \nTo answer the second and third questions, conversation \ntopics were compared before and after the introduction \nof the COVID-19 measures.\nSample\nThis study is centered around the first lockdown in the \nNetherlands, when the coronavirus first started to spread \nand impact the public. We believe that this period will \nshow the greatest disparity between conversation topics. \nThis lockdown took place on the March 23, 2020. Date \nspanned a roughly 6-month period, 3 months before and \n3 months after the measures were announced (Decem -\nber 1, 2019–May 31, 2020). Conversations were used \nfrom December 1st onward to roughly match the num -\nber of conversations in both time periods and to include \nenough conversations from a period no information on \nCOVID-19 was known.\nThe 6-month period yielded 8589 chat conversations \nthat passed an initial triage stage. Situations where the \nhelp seeker was injured or could not continue the con -\nversation in a safe environment were interrupted by the \ntriage. These help seekers were subsequently referred to \nemergency services. These conversations were therefore \nexcluded from this analysis. We used no further inclusion \ncriteria.\nFor the purposes of this study, an anonymized database \nof this chat service was used. This introduced no research \nburden for the help seekers and therefore reduced the \nchance of selection bias. Of these conversations, 5179 \n(60%) and 3410 (40%) took place before and after March \n23, respectively. Of the total sample, 1635 (19%) were \nmale, 6576 (77%) were female, and 378 (4%) indicated to \nhave a gender identity other than male or female. Further-\nmore, 6610 (80%) of the help seekers were under 30 years \nold, and 1662 (20%) were over 30 years old. Finally, 807 \n(9%) of the help seekers lived alone. There was a faulty \nage value in 300 conversations and these were declared \nmissing values. The category ‘other’ for gender contained \na small number of conversations. To avoid issues with the \nsample size of different topics this category was excluded \nfrom the analysis.\nData preprocessing\nChat transcripts are often noisy and unstructured. Unlike \nregular texts, a chat transcript is a conversation between \ntwo people. This causes it to evolve organically, usu -\nally leading to a wide variety of topics in a single docu -\nment. Furthermore, chat transcripts often include slang, \nshorthand, and spelling mistakes. Therefore, text needed \nto be preprocessed so that the information could be \nstructured.\nThe Natural Language Tool Kit [18] filtered out non-\ndescriptive words based on a common stop word list. For \nthe purpose of limiting the use of slang and shorthand, \nand also to eliminate spelling mistakes, the text was nar -\nrowed down to the 2000 most frequent words in the \nentire corpus.\nFor our study, we were interested in the conversa -\ntion topics of the help seeker. We also knew that hel -\npline counselors had not changed their protocols since \nthe arrival of COVID-19. Therefore, the messages of the \ncounselors were excluded. Messages of help seekers that \nwere under three words were also excluded, to limit basic \nmessages like greetings.\nAnalysis\nThe topic model method used in this study is a cluster -\ning of embeddings, based on the BERTopic method [19]. \nThe embeddings were obtained using Sentence-BERT \n[20], a modification of the Bidirectional Encoder Repre -\nsentations from Transformers (BERT) network [21] to \nefficiently create short text embeddings. The full message \nwas used for these embeddings. We used the pretrained \nmultilingual BERT model “distiluse-base-multilingual-\ncased” to obtain the embeddings [22].\nUsing Uniform Manifold Approximation and Pro -\njection for dimensionality reduction, the embeddings \nare reduced from 300 to 5 dimensions [23]. Finally, the \nembeddings were clustered with the Hierarchical Den -\nsity-based spatial clustering of applications with noise \n(HDBSCAN) algorithm [24]. HDBSCAN identifies and \nexcludes noisy data points from the clusters, contributing \nto greater clarity of the topic model.\nSeparate embeddings were created for each message \nof the help seekers. Because the messages get clustered, \neach chat is a combination of clusters. This method mim-\nics the approach of traditional topic modeling techniques \nlike Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), in which each \ndocument is modeled as a distribution of topics [25]. \nBERTopic was preferred due to a poor fit of LDA when \nusing the entire chat as input. Furthermore, due to the \nshorter length of the individual chat messages, we found \nthe BERTopic method to provide better results over LDA, \nwhile needing less parameter tuning. This method was \nalso compared to several other topic modeling methods, \nsuch as the contextual topic model [26], and found to \nprovide the best fit on the data.\nThe clustering of chat messages resulted in 81 clus -\nters. Some of the clusters were comprised exclusively of \nidentical messages. For example, messages like “I don’t \nknow” were used by many help seekers and therefore \nPage 4 of 10Salmi et al. BMC Public Health          (2022) 22:530 \nidentified as their own clusters. As these clusters \ndid not contain any relevant information, they were \nexcluded from the results. We identified 15 clusters \nwith this characteristic, resulting in 66 clusters from \nwhich the topics were derived.\nFinally, three methods were used to obtain definitions \nfor each of the topics. First, the preprocessed message \ncontents were grouped according to their assigned clus -\nter. The TF-IDF metric was used on the grouped text to \ngenerate a list of the top five words for each topic [19]. \nSecond, we inspected a handful of the anonymized mes -\nsages associated with each topic for extra context. Third, \ntwo experienced counselors also observed the top five \nwords along with the anonymized messages for each topic \nand provided their definitions. Based on this informa -\ntion, the final decision on the topic definitions was made \nby the first and second author. They solved uncertainties \nand discrepancies by checking several anonymized mes -\nsages from the topics and discussed additional insights. \nThe first author selected these messages based on how \ncentral to the cluster these messages were.\nBecause the number of conversations between the two \ntime periods was different, a relative measure was used to \ndetermine the difference in the use of a topic before and \nafter the introduction of the COVID-19 measures. Let  N1 \nand  N2 denote the total messages for the first and second \ntime periods respectively. Given  nt\n1 and  nt\n2 as the num -\nber of messages belonging to topic t in each time period, \nthe change in topic occurrence becomes:\nUltimately, this resulted in a rate of relative change for \neach topic, presented as a percentage in the results. These \nsame methods were also used to compute the change in \ntopic use for each of the different subgroups. To obtain \nthe change for each topic among men, women, younger, \nolder, and help seekers living alone, only the conversa -\ntions that fell into that subgroup were included.\nResults\nMost important topics\nThrough the topic modeling of all 8589 chat conversa -\ntions 66 topics were determined. The definitions as well \nas the frequencies and relative change of these topics \ncan be found in Table  1. The most frequent topics con -\ncerned events the help seeker experienced or treatment \nthe help seeker received in the previous days or weeks. \nFor example, help seekers talked about treatments they \nreceived or if they had discussed their suicidal thoughts \nwith a specialist.\nrt = nt\n2\nN 2\n/ nt\n1\nN 1\n− 1\nChanges in topics occurrence\nAs expected, during the initial months of the pandemic, \nhelp seekers more often contacted from home and more \noften mentioned encounters with new situations. Con -\nversations had more mentions of negative emotions. \nHowever, we also saw an increase in conversations that \nmentioned encounters with law enforcement, connected \nto suicide attempts or unsafe environments at home. Fur-\nthermore, problems with autism and ADHD appeared \nmore often in chat conversations during the lockdown.\nCOVID‑19 as a conversation topic\nThe most extreme result was, perhaps unsurprisingly, \nthe topic of the COVID-19 pandemic, which saw an \n808% increase in relative occurrence after the introduc -\ntion of COVID-19 containment measures. Table  2 shows \nsome of the common problems help seekers mentioned, \nas well as some example chat messages related to these \nproblems.\nChanges for gender, age, and living alone\nBecause relatively more women and young people con -\ntacted the chat service, their results are largely similar to \nthe total results. Tables  3 and 4 show the most remark -\nable differences between the two gender and age demo -\ngraphics, respectively. Table 5 shows the biggest changes \nfor help seekers who live alone.\nAfter the introduction of COVID-19 measures, con -\nversations with male help seekers more often involved \nfeelings of panic, fear, and emergency care. They also \nexpressed their gratitude more frequently.\nWhen looking at changes between the different age \ngroups after the introduction of COVID-19 measures, \nwe saw that younger help seekers focused more on nega -\ntive emotions. They also expressed a more frequent lack \nof confidence in themselves or others. Furthermore, the \nyounger help seekers did more often express thankfulness \nfor the conversation during the lockdown. On the other \nhand, older help seekers more often discussed problems \nwith medication, alcohol, and methods of self-harm.\nHelp seekers that lived alone showed the most extreme \nchanges between the two time periods. This is in part \nbecause this group was relatively small compared to the \ntotal number of help seekers. Nevertheless, there were \nstriking changes in this group. Help seekers that lived \nalone more often talked about suicidal thoughts or plans, \nand also about having no energy. On the other hand, \nthe conversations less often mentioned difficulty talking \nabout their situation or about self-harm.\nTo summarize, there was an increase in topics indicat -\ning gratefulness for the helpline. Furthermore, there was \na decrease in mention of plans for suicide and suicidal \nPage 5 of 10\nSalmi et al.

Help seekers under 30 showed an increased \nmention of negative emotion and lack of self-confidence, \nwhile help seekers over 30 showed an increased mention \nof problems with medication or alcohol.\nDiscussion\nThis study was conducted to inform suicide prevention \nstrategies for organizations in public and mental health \nthat help people with suicidal ideation. This was also the \nfirst study in the field of suicide prevention that used \nBERT embeddings resulting in an in-depth analysis of \na large number of conversations using topic modeling. \nThis study differs from previous studies on mental health \nconversational data. Examples of such studies dealt \nwith real-time topic modeling of crisis chat helplines \nwith LDA that leveraged experts during the training to \nimprove the model [27], and modeling of a set amount of \nconversation stages [28].\nThe topic model found multiple changes in topic fre -\nquency in the overall help seeker population. Several \nof these changes can be explained by the government \nmeasure. Examples of these are that help seekers called \nmore often from home, shared less about romantic rela -\ntionships, and talked less about their education. These \nchanges are in line with the government measures caus -\ning schools to close and recommendations to stay at \nhome to keep social interaction to a minimum.\nCertain changes pertaining to the functioning of the \nhelpline were of interest. There was increased mention \nTable 1 (continued)\nFrequency Relative Change Topic\n459 −1% The help seeker is doing better\n427 −5% The help seeker is bleeding\n417 −7% Help seeker has no more energy\n412 13% Help seeker indicates that a proposed solution doesn’t work\n412 −1% Negative emotions and weeping\n390 −5% Feelings of guilt and responsibility\n368 15% Help seeker is grateful for being listened to\n368 −9% Means for suicide in the kitchen\n358 3% Help seeker is grateful for the conversation\n337 16% The help seeker is experiencing something for the first time\n322 1% The help seeker is safe\n319 31% Help seeker is at home\n308 1% Distraction by taking the dog for a walk\n301 5% Loss of control\n273 −32% Romantic relationships\n271 18% Involvement of police in the event of a suicide attempt or unsafe home situation\n251 11% Problems due to autism or ADHD\nTable 2 Main categories within corona topic\nCOVID‑19 related problem Example chat message\nLoneliness The loneliness has become worse because of corona.\nNo distractions / lack of structure I also don’t have a lot of distraction now because everything is closed due to corona.\nChange in regular care It seems to get more difficult in this corona period because ...\nFeeling of getting locked up … a fear getting stuck at home because of corona.\nFear of the virus … with my fear of germs this whole corona situation is a nightmare come true.\nDifficult situation at home … and because of corona I work from home, it’s so stressful, and also not the best with my family.\n(Threat of ) unemployment I was fired from my other job because of corona.\nIncrease of fear and depression Due to this whole corona situation my anxiety is flaring up.\nConcerns about somebody else And I’m not allowed to go near my grandparents because my granddad has […] and if he gets \ncorona he will not survive\nAlcohol and drug abuse With corona it’s worse than usual.

BMC Public Health          (2022) 22:530 \n \nof thankfulness on the part of the help seekers for the \nconversation during the lockdown, indicating a desire for \ncontact. This is an important finding since loneliness and \nthwarted belongingness are strongly associated with sui -\ncidal ideation and behavior [29]. In a study on reporting \nthe COVID-19 related problems mentioned by help seek-\ners, van der Burgt et al. found interruption of regular care \nand loneliness to be the most frequently mentioned [30]. \nHelplines can provide support in times of loneliness that \nhas been amplified by the lockdown.\nThere was an increase in mentions of negative emo -\ntions and lack of self-confidence in chats, especially \namong younger help seekers. The mental health of this \ngroup was tracked in the UK by Pierce et al. [31]. They \nfound an increase in mental distress in the general pop -\nulation during the pandemic and specific groups, like \nadolescents, were affected more significantly. A study \non the age group 8–18 found indication that internal -\nizing problems of this group increased during the pan -\ndemic [32]. We know that this group is already at risk \nfor calling a suicide prevention help line. As an impor -\ntant period in their life for social emotional develop -\nment and with government measures still persisting \nit is important to provide and promote means for this \ngroup to socially interact on a regular basis to improve \ntheir.\nThere was a decrease in mentions of specific plans \nand methods for suicide. Furthermore, helplines saw \nan initial decrease in usage of the helpline and the \nobserved number of suicides during the early months \nof COVID-19, and there was no significant increase [9 ]. \nHowever, financial uncertainty and increased risk fac -\ntors due to social isolation would expect the opposite. \nSuicide remains a complex phenomenon and we cannot \nyet explain how these findings relate.\nThere was also an increase in mentions of panic and \nanxiety among male help seekers. This could be because \nof the image of social economic change [15].\nAmong help seekers who live alone, an increase in men-\ntions of specific suicide plans was observed. This group of \npeople were hit harder by the pandemic than most help \nseekers, and this was apparent in the discussed topics. \nA possible contribution could be the decrease of their \ndaily social contact during a lockdown. Combined with \nno contact at home, it could lead to more time with their \nown thoughts. The ruminative process affects the transi -\ntion of defeat leading to entrapment which can then turn \ninto suicidal ideation according to the model of O’conner \net al. [29]. It will be important for policy makers to keep \na close eye on how their actions affects people who live \nalone and provide leniency where possible so that contact \nfor this at-risk group could still be possible.\nLimitations\nWhile technology has progressed rapidly in recent \nyears, natural language processing remains a rand -\nomized process. Outliers or “noise” in the data is there -\nfore a factor to be aware of, and we acknowledge this as \na limitation of this study. With this method, noise could \nmanifest in three ways. First, the topic model does \nnot classify every message. This feature has the ben -\nefit of reducing false positives within the topic model, \nbased on the closeness to a cluster and the cluster size. \nTable 3 Comparison of topic change between men and women\nTotal Women Men Topic\n31% 44% −15% Help seeker is at home\n12% 21% −13% The help seeker is in his/her room\n6% 5% −14% Help seeker finds it difficult to talk about\n4% 2% 24% Panic and anxiety\n4% 13% −21% Desire to be happy\n3% − 2% 43% Help seeker is grateful for the conversation\n1% 5% −26% The help seeker has a lot on their mind \nand wants peace\n−2% −5% 43% Crisis service\n−5% 2% −29% Feelings of guilt and responsibility\n−7% −10% 11% Help seeker has no more energy\nTable 4 Comparison of topic change between help seekers \nyounger and older than 30\nTotal Age < 30 Age > = 30 Topic\n15% 31% −12% Help seeker is grateful for being listened \nto\n13% 22% −12% Negative emotions and weeping\n4% 15% −21% No confidence in self or others\n4% 13% −27% Desire to be happy\n3% 15% −20% Help seeker is grateful for the conversa-\ntion\n−2% −5% 9% Problems with medication and alcohol\n−9% −12% 11% Means for suicide in the kitchen\nTable 5 Topic change of help seekers who live alone\nTotal Living alone Topic\n−20% 15% School and study\n−9% 52% Has plans to die by suicide\n−6% 27% Suicidal thoughts\n−2% −41% Self-harm\n6% −62% Help seeker finds something \ndifficult or awkward\n1% −40% Help seeker is safe\n−7% 70% Help seeker has no more energy\nPage 8 of 10Salmi et al. BMC Public Health          (2022) 22:530 \nHowever, this does also mean that some of the mes -\nsages that could be considered relevant to the topic \ncan fall outside the cluster. The second limitation stems \nfrom the cluster size. Topics that have a smaller size \nare more prone to fluctuation and therefore have lower \nstatistical power. This effect is amplified when consid -\nering a smaller demographic, like male help seekers or \nhelp seekers who live alone. The third limitation con -\ncerns the accuracy of the BERT embeddings. While no \nmodel is perfect, the potential mismatch between the \ntext data used for training the BERT model and the chat \ndata is something to be aware of. The BERT model was \ntrained on a concatenation of Wikipedia pages [22]. As \nour dataset includes mostly conversational data, there \nmight be language usage specific to conversations that \nis therefore unseen by the BERT model. This could \ninfluence the number of messages classified as noise or \nwrongly assigned to a cluster.\nImplications\nSeveral implications for counsellors in a suicide preven -\ntion helpline are recommended. Some of the key pillars \nthat counsellors were trained to look for in a conver -\nsation were short-term coping, long-term hope to \nlive, reasons to live, and decreasing accessibility of the \nmeans for suicide. Counsellors can direct the conversa -\ntion to cover topics that are less often mentioned dur -\ning the lockdown. For example, two of the three topics \nabout short-term coping styles are less frequently \nreported by help seekers. Difficulty of finding distrac -\ntion also appeared as an recurring topic in a study by \nvan der Burgt et al. [30].\nPeople who live alone have no household to infect \nand we recommend policy makers to treat this group \naccordingly, by allowing exceptions for those who need \nit, to work from the office for example. Negative emo -\ntions among young people could have an increased \nchance to go unnoticed due to the decreased social \ninteraction. Allowing for social interaction outdoors, \nsuch as sporting events could be a possible way for \nyounger people to be able to talk to others and express \nemotions they cannot at home. This is also important \nbecause it is part of forming their identity through \ninteraction with peers [10, 11], which would also pro -\nmote self-confidence.\nFuture research\nThere are three main avenues of future work. First, \nthe current method can be applied to other time peri -\nods. As of the time of writing, there has already been \na second and third wave of the virus, and a second, \nstricter lockdown has gone into effect in the Nether -\nlands. With distinctive periods, characterized by the \ndifferent stages of lockdown, we can infer a better pic -\nture of help seeker trends over time. Second, we advise \norganizations that provide support through online \ncounseling that are interested in obtaining insights \non their demographic to consider this method. Third, \ntopic interpretability can be improved. One approach \ninvolves levering the attention mechanism underly -\ning the BERT model. A summary could potentially add \nsemantic context that a list of important words could \nnot. One potential way to do this is with transformer-\nbased models for summarization [33, 34].\nConclusion\nThis study offers new insights into a specific at-risk popu-\nlation for suicide by examining common problems that \nhelp seekers from a suicide prevention helpline experi -\nence. Although the number of suicides fortunately has \nnot increased during the COVID-19 pandemic in the \nNetherlands in 2020, changes in frequencies of these \nproblems during the lockdown were detected. Help \nseekers showed a decreased mention of topics involv -\ning distractions and plans or methods for suicide. Top -\nics involving gratefulness for the conversation saw an \nincrease in mention.\nFurthermore, the model detected several changes in \nsub demographics of the help seekers. Among help seek -\ners who live alone there was in increase in mention of \nplans for suicide. Male help seekers showed an increase \nmention of panic and anxiety. Help seekers under 30 \nshowed an increase in mentions of negative emotions \nand lack of self-confidence.\nIt remains important, during this period of reduced \nsocial interaction, increased fear and uncertainty, to \nkeep monitoring the changes over time, to allow for \nexceptions for younger, male or help seekers who live \nalone where possible, and to keep help and communi -\ncation available.\nAbbreviations\nHDBSCAN: Hierarchical Density-based spatial clustering of applications with \nnoise; LDA: Latent Dirichlet Allocation; BERT: Bidirectional Encoder Representa-\ntions from Transformers.\nAcknowledgements\nNot applicable.\nAuthors’ contributions\nSS had full access to all the data in the study and takes responsibility for the \nintegrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.
