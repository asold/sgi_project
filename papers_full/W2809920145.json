  "abstract": "A decisive technical challenge for transformer manufacturers is correctly drying the cellulose insulation. During the production of a transformer, it is necessary to reduce its insulation’s moisture content from about 8% to less than 1% in the shortest possible time period. The drying of insulation is a time-consuming process, and for high-power transformers, it can last up to three weeks. Several drying techniques are used during the production of a transformer, and all of them require heating up the insulation to a high temperature and applying a vacuum. Unfortunately, the use of a high drying temperature above 100 °C can cause a decrease in the degree of cellulose polymerization by over a dozen percentage points. This paper presents a new concept for drying cellulose insulation that does not require heating insulation and applying a vacuum. In this solution, methanol is used as the drying medium. The research results showed the possibility of drying cellulose insulation by means of methanol with different initial moisture contents. The possibility of completely drying pressboard of various thicknesses for a sufficient period of time was also proven. The paper also presents a new concept of both the device and the procedure for drying cellulose insulation by means of methanol.",
