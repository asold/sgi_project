  "abstract": "To support data-driven decision-making in a Manufacturing Execution System (MES) environment, a system that can quickly and accurately analyze a wide range of production, quality, asset, and material information must be deployed. However, existing MES data management approaches rely on predefined queries or report templates that lack flexibility and limit real-time decision support. In this paper, we proposes a domain-specific Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture that extends LangChain’s capabilities with Manufacturing Execution System (MES)-specific components and the Ollama-based Local Large Language Model (LLM). The proposed architecture addresses unique MES requirements including real-time sensor data processing, complex manufacturing workflows, and domain-specific knowledge integration. It implements a three-layer structure: an application layer using FastAPI for high-performance asynchronous processing, an LLM layer for natural language understanding, and a data storage layer combining MariaDB, Redis, and Weaviate for efficient data management. The system effectively handles MES-specific challenges such as schema relationships, temporal data processing, and security concerns without exposing sensitive factory data. This is an industry-specific, customized approach focusing on problem-solving in manufacturing sites, going beyond simple text-based RAG. The proposed architecture considers the specificity of data sources, real-time and high-availability requirements, the reflection of domain knowledge and workflows, compliance with security and quality control regulations, and direct interoperability with MES systems. The architecture can be further enhanced through integration with various manufacturing systems, an advanced LLM, and distributed processing frameworks while maintaining its core focus on MES domain specialization.",
