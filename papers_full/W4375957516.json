These models use a\ndual-encoder architecture that encodes both queries and passages\nwith a PLM encoder into dense embeddings. They then perform\napproximate nearest neighbor (ANN) searching in the embedding\nspace. Compared to traditional bag-of-words approaches, DRs benefit\nfrom semantic soft matching, which helps overcome the problem\nof word mismatch in passage retrieval [33, 45].\nTo leverage the semantic modelling power of DRs, recent research\nhas extended English-only DRs to support cross-lingual settings [1,\n2, 19, 22, 27, 31], i.e, where queries and passages are in different\nlanguages. This is achieved using multi-lingual PLMs, such as mul-\ntilingual BERT [ 6], in place of the English-only PLMs. This ap-\nproach is particularly important in this setting where traditional\nbag-of-words methods are ineffective due to the limited number\nof matching terms across languages. In contrast, cross-lingual DRs\n(xDRs) are able to encode queries and passages in different languages\ninto a shared embedding space, enabling efficient ANN search\nacross languages. However, such multi-lingual PLM-based xDRs\nusually are less effective on the cross-lingual passage retrieval task\nthan DRs in the English-only setting [1]. The hypothesis to explain\nthis result is that, in the English-only setting, a DR only needs to\nlearn relevance matching between queries and passages. In contrast,\na xDR not only needs to learn the relevance matching task, but\nalso needs to learn how to align the embeddings of texts with\nsimilar semantic meaning but in different language [24, 41]. It is\nthis language gap that makes cross lingual retrieval a relatively\nharder task for xDRs.\nBased on this hypothesis, this paper proposes the use of cross-\nlingual query generation (xQG) to bridge the language gap for xDRs.\nOur approach is illustrated in Figure 1. Specifically, we fine-tune a\nmultilingual T5 (mT5) model using language-specific prompts to\ngenerate several queries per passage for each target language. In\nthe indexing phase, we use a given xDR model to encode passages\nand their associated generated queries in different languages into\nembeddings. Finally, we augment the original passage embeddings\nwith the embeddings of the generated queries before adding them\nto the ANN index. By doing so, we move the passage embeddings\nto a space that is closer to the target user query language. Our\napproach does not add extra query latency and can be applied to\nany existing xDRs.\n2 RELATED WORKS\nCross-lingual dense retrievers.The development of cross-lingual\npre-trained language models has significantly contributed to the\narXiv:2305.03950v1  [cs.IR]  6 May 2023\nSIGIR ’23, July 23–27, 2023, Taipei, Taiwan Shengyao Zhuang, Linjun Shou, and Guido Zuccon\nFigure 1: Augmenting passage representations with cross-lingual generated query embeddings. The query examples shown in this figure were\ngenerated using our trained xQG model. For each query, we report the corresponding translation obtained using Google’s translation service.\nprogress of cross-lingual dense retrieval (xDR) [4, 5, 8, 39]. Notable\nexamples of recent xDR methods include CORA [2], which employs\na generator to facilitate retrieval training data mining, Sentri [31],\nwhich proposes a single encoder and self-training, and DR.DECR [19],\nwhich utilizes parallel queries and sentences for cross-lingual knowl-\nedge distillation. Among these, our work is most closely related\nto QuiCK [27], which also utilizes a cross-lingual query generator\nfor xDR. However, unlike QuiCK, which uses the xQG as a teacher\nmodel in knowledge distillation for xDR in the training phase, our\nmethod directly augments passage embeddings with xQG queries\nwithout any xDR training involved.\nQuery generation for information retrieval.Query generation\nis a well-established technique that has been widely used to improve\nretrieval performance in various retrieval models [11, 25]. In addition,\nit has been shown to be effective for domain adaptation in dense\npassage retrieval tasks [ 23, 32, 34], as well as for enhancing the\neffectiveness of other PLM-based rankers [37, 48]. In our approach,\nwe also rely on a query generation model to generate high-quality\nqueries for downstream passage embedding augmentation tasks.\nAugmenting embeddings for dense retrievers.Our method\nrelies on effectively augmenting representations encoded by DR\nencoders – a direction recently explored also by other works. For\ninstance, Li et al. [16, 17] use the top retrieved passages as pseudo-\nrelevant feedback to augment query embeddings using the Rocchio\naggregation function. Similarly, Zhuang et al. [47] extend this idea\nby using embeddings of clicked passages to augment query em-\nbeddings. Other PRF methods have also been extensively researched\nto enhance both English-only dense retrieval [ 18, 35, 36, 42, 46]\nand cross-lingual dense retrieval [3]. On the other hand, the HyDE\nmethod uses large pre-trained language models to generate hypo-\nthetical passages for a given query and directly uses the embedding\nof the hypothetical passage to perform the search [ 9]. While all\nthese works focus on augmenting query embeddings for DRs at\nquery time, our work focuses on augmenting passage embeddings\nat indexing time , thereby avoiding the extra overhead in terms of\nquery latency.\n3 METHOD\nOur approach consists of two components: (1) a cross-lingual query\ngeneration model that, for each passage, generates high-quality\nqueries in different languages, and (2) an embedding aggregation\nfunction that augments the original passage embedding with the\nembeddings of the generated queries.\nTo obtain a xQG model, we fine-tune a mT5 model with labeled\nrelevant (𝑞𝑡 , 𝑝)pairs, where 𝑡 is the target query language. We use\na seq2seq objective akin to docTquery-T5’s objective [25]; in our\ncase the input is the passage text with language-specific prompts:\nprompt (𝑡, 𝑝)= Generate a [𝑡]question for this passage: [𝑝], (1)\nwhere [𝑡]and [𝑝]are prompt placeholders for the target language\nand passage text, respectively. Once we have trained a xQG model,\nwe can generate a set of queries for each target language and\npassage by replacing the placeholders accordingly:\n𝑄𝑝 =\nØ\n𝑡∈𝑇\n𝑄𝑡\n𝑝 ; 𝑄𝑡\n𝑝 = xQG (prompt (𝑡, 𝑝))× 𝑛, (2)\nwhere 𝑇 is the target language set and 𝑄𝑝 is the set of all generated\nqueries for passage 𝑝 which includes 𝑛 generated queries for each\ntarget language. In our experiments, we use a top- 𝑘 sampling\nscheme [7] to generate queries, and set 𝑘 = 10. We find that these\nsimple language-specific prompts can effectively lead the T5 model\nto generate the desired output in that language.\nFor the embedding aggregation function, we use a Rocchio-\nlike aggregation function that is similar to previous works that\naggregated dense representations [16, 47]. We use this aggregation\nfunction to obtain the embeddings of all passages in the corpus:\n𝑒𝑚𝑏(𝑝, 𝑄𝑝, 𝜃, 𝛼)= (1 −𝛼)·𝜃 (𝑝)+𝛼\n∑︁\n^𝑞𝑡 ∈𝑄𝑝\n𝜃 (^𝑞𝑡 ), (3)\nwhere ^𝑞𝑡 is a generated query for target language 𝑡, 𝜃 is the xDR\nencoder model and 𝜃 (.)is the text embedding given by the xDR\nencoder. The hyper-parameter 𝛼 is the augmentation ratio, 𝛼 ∈\n[0, 1]. This ratio is used to control the weights assigned to the\noriginal passage embedding and the generated query embeddings.\n4 EXPERIMENTAL SETTINGS\nWe design our experiments to answer the research questions:\nRQ1: How does the number of generated queries affect xDR ef-\nfectiveness?\nRQ2: How does the augmentation ratio 𝛼 impact xDR effective-\nness?\nRQ3: How do the queries generated for each language impact xDR\neffectiveness?\nDatasets and Evaluation.We train and evaluate our approach on\nXOR-TyDi [1], a cross-lingual open retrieval question answering\nbenchmark dataset. The dataset contains approximately 15k an-\nnotated relevant passage-query pairs in the training set and 2k\npassage-answer pairs in the dev set. Queries in both the train and\ndev sets are in seven typologically diverse languages (Ar, Bn, Fi, Ja,\nKo, Ru, and Te), while passages are in English. There are about 18M\npassages in the corpus. We use the training set to train both the\nAugmenting Passage Representations with Query Generation SIGIR ’23, July 23–27, 2023, Taipei, Taiwan\nTable 1: xDR models trained with different backbone PLMs. Zero-shot means trained with only the English subset of the NQ training data\n(thus, zero-shot for the cross-lingual task).

We evaluate the effectiveness of our ap-\nproach and baselines using recall at 𝑚 kilo-tokens (R@𝑚kt), which\nis the dataset’s official evaluation metric. This metric computes\nthe fraction of queries for which the minimal answer is contained\nin the top 𝑚 tokens of the retrieved passages. We consider 𝑚 =\n2𝑘, 5𝑘 (R@2kt and R@5kt), as per common practice for this dataset.\nStatistical significant differences are reported with respect to a\ntwo-tailed t-test with Bonferroni correction.\nBaselines. Following common practice on XOR-TyDi [ 1], we\nadapt DPR [14] to the cross-lingual setting by initializing it with\ndifferent multilingual pre-trained language models (PLMs). Specifi-\ncally, in our experiments we use the multilingual variants of BERT [6]\n(mBERT) and XLM-RoBERTa [ 5] (XLM-R) for this purpose. In\naddition to the standard supervised baselines, we also explore how\nour xQG embedding augmentation approach can improve a zero-\nshot xDR model, where the xDR is initialized with mBERT but it\nis trained with English only passage-query pairs and is directly\napplied to the XOR-TyDi cross-lingual retrieval task.\nImplementation details.We initialize our xQG model with the\nmultilingual T5-base checkpoint provided by Google1 and available\nin the Huggingface library [38]. We fine-tune this checkpoint with\nthe passage-query pairs in the XOR-TyDi training set. We train\nthe xQG model for 1600 steps using a batch size of 128 and a\nlearning rate of 1e-4. After training, we generate 5 queries per\npassage for each target language, resulting in about 7 * 5 * 18M\n= 630M generated queries in total. We use four A100 GPUs to\ngenerate all queries; this process took about 70 hours to complete.\nWe release our generated queries on the Huggingface hub 2 to\nallow the community to reuse this resource [30]. For training the\nxDRs, we use the Tevatron dense retriever training toolkit [ 10],\nwhich uses with BM25 hard negative passages. We train the xDRs\nwith a batch size of 128, initializing them with mBERT base 3 or\nXLM-R base4 checkpoints and training them on the XOR-TyDi\ntraining set for 40 epochs. For each training sample, we set the\nnumber of hard negative passages in the contrastive loss to 7 and\napplied in-batch negatives training. We use a learning rate of 1e-5\n1https://huggingface.co/google/mt5-base\n2https://huggingface.co/datasets/ielab/xor-tydi-xqg-augmented\n3https://huggingface.co/bert-base-multilingual-cased\n4https://huggingface.co/xlm-roberta-base\nFigure 2: Impact of the amount of generated queries for target\nlanguage.

For\nthe zero-shot xDR, we use the same training configurations as for\nthe mBERT-based xDR trained on XOR-TyDi but using the Natural\nQuestions (NQ) training data [ 15] which contains English-only\nquery-passage training samples.\n5 RESULTS\n5.1 Main results\nTable 1 presents the effectiveness of xDR models initialized with\nthe XLM-R and mBERT backbone PLMs and trained on the XOR-\nTyDi dataset. Zero-shot denotes the models trained only on the\nEnglish subset of the NQ dataset. In these experiments, we use all\nthe queries generated by our xQG and set the augmentation ratio\nto 𝛼 = 0.01 for augmenting the passage embeddings of the xDRs.\nFor the R@2kt metric, the xDR initialized with mBERT out-\nperforms the xDR initialized with XLM-R, achieving an average\nR@2kt score of 44.1, while XLM-R achieves an average score of 27.5.\nOur xQG passage embedding augmentation approach improves\nthe XLM-R xDR, achieving an average score of 29.8, which is a\nstatistically significant improvement compared to its baseline effect-\niveness (𝑝 < 0.05). Similarly, mBERT’s effectiveness improves with\nxQG, achieving an average score of 46.2, which is also a statistically\nSIGIR ’23, July 23–27, 2023, Taipei, Taiwan Shengyao Zhuang, Linjun Shou, and Guido Zuccon\nFigure 3: Impact of the augmentation ratio 𝛼. Scores are averaged\nacross all languages. Statistical significant improvements over no\naugmentation (𝛼 = 0) are labelled with stars ( 𝑝 < 0.05).\nsignificant improvement compared to its corresponding baseline\n(𝑝 < 0.05). The zero-shot mBERT model achieves an average R@2kt\nof 33.0; this also improves when combined with xQG, achieving an\naverage score of 36.0. This improvement is statistically significant\n(𝑝 < 0.05). Similar trends are found for R@5kt. Overall, we find\nthat our xQG can significantly improve all investigated xDR models.\nIn terms of per language effectiveness, xQG improves almost all\nmodels across all languages with the exceptions of mBERT’s R@2kt\nfor Japanese (Ja) and mBERT’s R@5kt for Finnish (Fi).\nIn summary, mBERT performs better than XLM-R for both R@2kt\nand R@5kt. The use of xQG embedding augmentation statistically\nsignificantly improves the effectiveness of both backbones.\n5.2 RQ1: Impact of number of generated\nqueries\nFigure 2 reports the impact of using different amounts of generated\nqueries to augment passage embeddings when using mBERT xDR.\nThe results suggest that using more generated queries is beneficial\nfor both R@2tk and R@5tk. The improvements become statistically\nsignificant when 4 or more generated queries are used for each\ntarget language. While the curves do not plateau, indicating that\nusing even more generated queries could further improve the effect-\niveness, our experiments were limited to up to 5 generated queries\nper target language due to computational constraints.\n5.3 RQ2: Impact of augmentation ratio\nWe report the impact of the augmentation ratio 𝛼 on the effective-\nness of xDR in Figure 3. Higher values of𝛼 correspond to assigning\nmore weight to the generated query embeddings during embedding\naggregation, and 𝛼 = 0 corresponds to no augmentation. As shown\nin the figure, even a small value of 𝛼 (0.01) leads to a significant\nimprovement in both R@2kt and R@5kt. The best effectiveness is\nachieved when 𝛼 = 0.02. However, using higher values of𝛼 does\nnot result in further improvements – rather, it can even hurt the\neffectiveness when 𝛼 > 0.05. Based on these results, we conclude\nthat the augmentation ratio in our embedding aggregation function\nhas a significant impact on the effectiveness of xDR, and using a\nsmall value of 𝛼 can be beneficial for improving effectiveness.\nFigure 4: R@2kt for target languages (rows) augmented by source\ngenerated queries (columns). We plot 𝛼 from 0 to 0.1 with step size\nof 0.01 (x axis). Statistically significant better results with respect to\nno augmentation ( 𝛼 = 0) are labelled with stars ( 𝑝 < 0.05).\n5.4 RQ3: Impact of each languages\nIn the previous experiments we used all the queries generated for a\npassage to augment the original passage embedding, irrespective of\nlanguage of the generated query. Next, we investigate the impact on\neffectiveness of using generated queries from each of the languages\nseparately. We analyze this in Figure 4, where we plot R@2kt for\neach target language (rows) against different values of 𝛼 (x-axis).\nThe plots in the diagonal show that xDR effectiveness improves\nwhen passage embeddings are augmented with generated queries\nfor the same language. Notably, we observe that the best value of𝛼\nvaries across different languages, and the improvements in effective-\nness are not always statistically significant. We also observe that, for\nsome languages, queries generated for other languages can improve\nthe effectiveness of target queries in a different language. For\ninstance, using queries generated for Japanese (Ja) can improve the\neffectiveness of target queries in Korean (ko), while using Russian\n(Ru) generated queries can help target queries in Telugu (Te). These\nresults suggest that the embeddings of the queries generated for\nany single language potentially can also provide useful information\nfor target queries in other languages.\n6 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\nIn this paper we propose a passage embedding augmentation ap-\nproach to enhance the effectiveness of cross-lingual DRs. Our\nmethod can be applied to any cross-lingual DR and it requires\nno further DR training nor changes to the retrieval pipeline. We\nempirically showed the method is effective for the cross-lingual DPR\nmethod across different backbones. However, a limitation of our\nempirical investigation is that we did not evaluate the method across\nother dense retriever architectures. We leave the extension of this\nAugmenting Passage Representations with Query Generation SIGIR ’23, July 23–27, 2023, Taipei, Taiwan\ninvestigation to future work. We also note that our approach relies\non a xQG model that can generate high quality queries. However,\na recent work has shown that T5-based query generation is prone\nto hallucination and that along with highly effective queries, the\ngenerator also produces poor queries that negatively impact re-\ntrieval effectiveness [ 11]. They then propose the use of a cross-\nencoder ranker to filter out some ineffective generated queries; this\npractice can further improve effectiveness. We leave the adaptation\nof this approach in our xQG setting to future work.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Akari Asai, Jungo Kasai, Jonathan H. Clark, Kenton Lee, Eunsol Choi, and\nHannaneh Hajishirzi. 2021.
