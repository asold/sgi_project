However, not all English language\neducators in the Vietnamese context and other similar contexts are well aware of\nintercultural language teaching since th ere lacks instructional design models to\nintegrate intercultural content into English language classes. This project, therefore,\naims to test the effectiveness of a develop ed intercultural co mmunicative language\nteaching (ICLT) model. It involved forty-seven EFL learners learning General English\nat a foreign language center in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Three research instruments,\nnamely language test, intercultural competence test and semi-structured group\ninterview were employed to garner data. The findings revealed that after a thirteen\nweek training course, EFL learners ’ language competence and intercultural competence\nhad similar patterns of improvement. This project, thus, implies that the ICLT model is\neffective in facilitating EFL learners ’ ICC development, and it can be applied in other\nsimilar EFL contexts.\nKeywords: Intercultural communicative language teaching (ICLT), Intercultural\ncommunicative competence (ICC), EFL learners, Model, Vietnamese context\nIntroduction\nIn the current context of globalisation, English as an international language, lingua\nfranca, and a global language (e.g., Tavakoli, Shirinbakhsh, & Rezazadeh, 2012) is used\nas a means of communication in multicultural contexts. Additionally, in order to inter-\nact with people of different cultural backgrounds effectively and appropriately, one\nneeds to be intercullturally communicative competent. Accordingly, the issue of devel-\noping intercultural communicative competence (ICC) to ESL/EFL learners has been\nidentified as one of the ultimate goals in the field of English language education (e.g.,\nByram, 1997; Deardoff, 2009; Fantini, 2000; Lázár et al., 2007) in an attempt to present\nlearners with cultural differences which help learners to be interculturally aware of\ntheir own culture and the presence of otherness as well as to appreciate and respect\nthem. Moreover, English language education should equip learners with the knowledge\nof intercultural communication and the ability to use it effectively in order to bridge\ncultural differences and achieve more harmonious, productive relations (Samovar, Porter,\n& McDaniel, 2012).\nAsian-Paciﬁc Journal of Second\nand Foreign Language Education\n© The Author(s). 2018 Open Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International\nLicense ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium,\nprovided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons license, and\nindicate if changes were made.\nTran and Duong Asian-Pacific Journal of Second and Foreign Language Education\n (2018) 3:6 \nhttps://doi.org/10.1186/s40862-018-0048-0\nNevertheless, it is not always seen that the role of culture as well as intercultural\ncommunication in English language education is well acknowledged. Gonen and\nSaglam ( 2012) point out that “teachers in different classrooms in different parts of the\nworld still ignore the importance of teaching culture as a part of language study ” (p. 26).\nThat is, teachers endeavor to promote only their learners ’language proficiency instead of\nendowing them with ICC in order to function effectively and appropriately in multicul-\ntural situations. The reasons behind teachers ’ignorance of inclusion of culture and inter-\ncultural communication in English language education are that teachers are “more\ninterested in practical aspects of communication ” (Onalan, 2005, p. 217); teachers feel\nthey do not have enough time to talk about cultural elements in their teaching practices\ndue to the demanding curriculum (e.g., Gonen & Saglam, 2012; Hong, 2008); teachers do\nnot know how to incorporate culture and intercultural communication in the language\nclassroom since they lack adequate training on how to incorporate culture in their teach-\ning practices as well as how to measure learners ’ intercultural competence (IC) and\nchanges in their attitudes as a result of culture teaching (Gonen & Saglam, 2012); and\nmost teachers have limited knowledge about intercultural communication (Sercu, 2005).\nGiven the fact that the ICC is one of the key competences in the twenty-first century,\nso it is agreed that one of the ultimate goals in language training programs is to educate\nlearners to become intercultural speakers who can deal with linguistic and cultural\ncomplexity and take part in multicultural situations (e.g., Deardoff, 2009; Jæger, 2001).\nNevertheless, in the reality of English language education in Vietnam context, most of\nthe English language training programs lack the integration of cultural content into\ntheir curricula, and English language users are, to some extent, incapable of using\nEnglish appropriately and effectively when communicating with others from different\nlinguistic and cultural backgrounds due to l ack of awareness of cultural difference. It\nis, hence, imperative that developing ICC to EFL/ESL learners should be taken into\nserious consideration in English language training programs so as to help English\nlearners become intercultural speakers who can function effectively and appropriately\nin the twenty-first century. This project aims to explore the effectiveness of utilising\nthe intercultural communicative langua ge teaching (ICLT) model in enhancing EFL\nlearners’ICC, and it endeavors to address the research question as follows:\nTo what extent does EFL learners ’ICC (language competence and intercultural com-\npetence) develop using the ICLT model?\nLiterature review\nIt is seen that the concept of ICC is variously defined by different scholars (e.g., Bennett\n& Bennett, 2004; Byram, 1997; Fantini, 2001; Sinicrope et al., 2007), resulting in the\nconfusion in addressing the same issue. In this project, ICC can be understood as the\nability which enables one to effectively and appropriately interact in a language other\nthan one ’s native language with others from different linguistic and cultural back-\ngrounds. It consists of language competence (linguistic, sociolinguistic, and discourse\ncompetence) and intercultural competence (attitudes, knowledge, skills, and awareness)\nthat help one to be able to successfully integrate in a multicultural society (adapted\nfrom Bennett & Bennett, 2004; Byram, 1997; Fantini, 2001; Sinicrope et al., 2007).\nFrom different views on ICC, it is seen that various models of ICC have been pro-\nposed to address many aspects of ICC, e.g., model of ICC (Byram, 1997); IC model\nTran and Duong Asian-Pacific Journal of Second and Foreign Language Education  (2018) 3:6 Page 2 of 17\n(Fantini, 2000); pyramid model of IC (Deardorff, 2006). Byram ’s( 1997) model of ICC is\none of the most comprehensive frameworks to develop as well as evaluate learners ’\nICC in different contexts. In his ICC model, Byram ( 1997) points out that IC, which re-\nlates to other competences, namely linguistic competence, sociolinguistic competence\nand discourse competence, consists of five elements such as attitudes, knowledge, skills\nof interpreting and relating, skills of discovery and interaction, and critical cultural\nawareness/political education. Based upon this model, he formulates specific educa-\ntional objectives which are designed for language and culture learning and serve as\nguiding criteria to develop and assess learners ’ IC in the foreign language class. Those\neducational objectives are specific and detailed, but they do not specify the different\nlevels of IC to be obtained at different stages through the process of education since he\nargues that establishing levels is quite problematic for the attitude factor.\nIn respect of the Fantini's ( 2000) IC model which includes awareness, attitudes, skills,\nand knowledge, this IC model is likely to overlap with Byram ’s( 1997) intercultural ele-\nments. Although the IC model does not include explicitly the element of language in\nthe IC model, Fantini ( 1997) argues that proficiency in the host language plays an im-\nportant part in enhancing one ’s IC. He adds that language education should focus more\non intercultural aspects so that learners can develop “awareness, attitudes, skills, and\nknowledge that will make [them] better participants on a local and global level, able to\nunderstand and to empathize with others in new ways ” (Fantini, 1997, pp. 13 – 14). In\nanother aspect, Fantini ( 2000) explains that awareness which refers to self-awareness\nand reflection leads “deeper cognition, skills, and attitudes just as it is also enhanced by\ntheir development ” (p. 29). In other words, awareness helps to develop other compo-\nnents of IC while it simultaneously benefits from their development. Furthermore, he\npoints out that the development of IC is an on-going and lifelong process inasmuch as\none is always in the process of ‘becoming’and is never completely interculturally com-\npetent. He emphasizes that although one may develop and expand one ’s competencies,\nnew challenges always appear, and a good condition for one to develop one ’s IC is the\ncontact and experience with people of other languages and cultures in a positive\nsetting.\nRegarding the Deardorff ’s( 2006) pyramid model of IC which is a research-based one,\nthe pyramid model of IC has two other different elements of internal outcomes and ex-\nternal outcomes apart from the three elements of attitudes, knowledge, and skills as in\nByram’s( 1997) and Fantini ’s( 2000) models. All of these five elements are arranged in\nlevels of the pyramid lower levels of which are the basis to enhance the higher ones.\nHowever, Deardorff ( 2006) develops another way to organize and display the data in\nthe process model of IC, which contains the same elements as her pyramid model of\nIC. This process model of IC describes the complexity of acquiring IC from “attitudes\nand/or attitudes and skills/knowledge directly to the external outcome, but the degree\nof appropriateness and effectiveness of the outcome may not be nearly as high as when\nthe entire cycle is completed and begins again ” (ibid., p. 257).\nThere have been different studies which attempt to include intercultural content into\nlanguage education. It is noticed that the most common focus of study is the application\nof information and communications techno logy (ICT) such as computer, the Inter-\nnet, video and other technologies to pro mote the acquisition of IC/ICC (e.g.,\nGarretts-Rucks, 2010;O ' N e i l , 2008). Other three common focuses of study are the\nTran and Duong Asian-Pacific Journal of Second and Foreign Language Education  (2018) 3:6 Page 3 of 17\nuse of new approaches in IC/ICC development (e.g., Gómez, 2012;N a k a n oe ta l . ,2011), the\ncontexts of ICC promotion (e.g., Pierson, 2010; Ottoson, 2013), and the characteristics /\ndifficulties / challenges / factors in intercu ltural communication (e.g., Alexandru,\n2012;M o l o n e y ,2007). However, no research has been reported conducting an action\nresearch to develop EFL learners ’ ICC by applying a specific ICLT model in the\nVietnamese EFL context. This study is, therefore, hoped to fill up such a gap in the\ncontext of Vietnam.\nMethods\nIntercultural communicative language teaching (ICLT) model\nPrior to the experiment, an ICLT model was developed to facilitate EFL learners ’ ICC\ndevelopment.\nThe ICLT model is an on-going process of ICC acquisition. There are three parts\n(Fig. 1): Language-Culture, the main training process ( Input – Notice – Practice –\nOutput), and the ICC, which are systematically integrated. The second part is the\nmain part consisting of four teaching steps to facilitate learners ’ ICC development,\nand each step reflects a step of the knowledge scaffolding and constructing process to\nfacilitate learners ’ICC development.\nLanguage-culture\nThis reflects the view of language and culture which is closely intertwined, and it is the\nfoundation for the ICLT model.\nInput\nThis teaching step is aimed at providing learners with language knowledge and inter-\ncultural knowledge by exposing learners to a wide range of authentic texts and sources\n(oral, written, and visual) about language and different cultures. The theory of Krashen ’s\nComprehensible Input Hypothesis (Krashen, 1985)i se m b e d d e di nt h i st e a c h i n gs t e pt o\nincrease learners’learning motivation by exposing learners to comprehensible input that\nis understandable but one step beyond their understanding.\nFig. 1 ICLT model (Tran, 2016, p.124). This figure is reproduced under the permission of its author\nTran and Duong Asian-Pacific Journal of Second and Foreign Language Education  (2018) 3:6 Page 4 of 17\nNotice\nBased on their previous knowledge of language and interculture, learners are encour-\naged to notice and make comparisons between unfamiliar features with known ones. In\naddition, learners discuss the reasons for language and intercultural features as well as\ntheir personal response to those language and intercultural features. This teaching step,\nwhich is the next step of the knowledge scaffolding and constructing process, utilizes\nthe theory of Schmidt ’s Noticing Hypothesis (Schmidt, 1995, 2001) to help to raise\nlearners’ language awareness and intercultural awareness and adjust their intercultural\nattitudes by exposing learners to more authentic learning tasks / activities so that they\ncan attend to and notice unknown features of the input.\nPractice\nLearners have a variety of opportunities to practice short, supported and guided com-\nmunicative tasks about elements of the new knowledge in the two previous teaching\nsteps. Moreover, they have chances to practice using intercultural language strategies\nfor communication in accordance to their language and cultural needs. The theory of\nLong’s Interaction Hypothesis (Long, 1985, 1996)i se m p l o y e di nt h i st e a c h i n gs t e pf o s t e r\nlearners’ICC development by assisting learners to make use of their previous comprehen-\nsible input to enhance their language skills (e.g., speaking, listening, reading, and reading)\nand intercultural skills (e.g., abilities to interpret the meanings in the target culture and re-\nlate them to one ’s own and to interact with people from different cultures).\nOutput\nAt this stage, learners are able to produce the earlier input features and reflect on their\neffectiveness and appropriateness. Furthermore, learners are able to explore further in\nthe new language and intercultural features by trying out new forms, expressions, or\nstrategies derived from the earlier input in actual language use through language and\nintercultural tasks (e.g., project, drama, presentation, etc.). The underlying learning the-\nory is the theory of Swain ’s Output Hypothesis (Swain, 1995, 2000) which aims to raise\nlearners’awareness of a gap in his/her learning process. This may trigger a new input\nfor another process of the ICLT model as learners ’ output is a process rather than a\nproduct of their ICC learning.\nIntercultural communicative competence\nThe ultimate goal of ICLT is to help learners to become intercultural speakers with\nICC who can interact effectively and appropriately with others from different cultures.\nWithin this ICLT model, the arrows among the components indicate the sequence of\nthe process, and the dotted arrows depict the interrelationship between the main part\nand the foundation and the ultimate goal of the ICLT process.\nResearch setting\nThis project was carried out at SouthEast Asian Ministers of Education Organisation,\nRegional Training Center (SEAMEO RETRAC), a Foreign Language Center in Ho Chi\nMinh City, Vietnam, which provided a variety of language training programs. Each of\nwhich has many levels from elementary to advanced. This center had seventy-seven\nEnglish language teachers from not only English-speaking countries such as New Zealand,\nAustralia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America but also\nnon-English-speaking countries like Vietnam, the Philippines, and South Korea. All these\nTran and Duong Asian-Pacific Journal of Second and Foreign Language Education  (2018) 3:6 Page 5 of 17\nteachers held university and/or postgraduate degrees and internationally recognized\nTESOL qualifications. The Vietnamese teachers of English and foreign teachers of English\nwere scheduled to share the teaching time of each class in accordance to the level of the\nclass.\nCourse design\nThe course lasting over a period of thirteen weeks was instructed by a Vietnamese\nteacher of English (the researcher), who met the class twice a week, and a foreign\nteacher of English, who met the class once a week. Each session lasted two hours, so\nthe total number of teaching hours for the whole course was seventy-six including\nseventy-two in-class teaching hours and four end-of-course assessment hours. As the\npurpose of this study is to improve the effectiveness of an ICLT model, the intercultural\ncontent was included in the English language class. The distribution of teaching hours\n(Table 1) was that teacher one (the researcher) was responsible for teaching both regu-\nlar lessons (24 teaching hours) and ICC lessons (24 teaching hours); the foreign teacher\nwas responsible for twenty-four hours of teaching which consisted of language quizzes,\nIC quizzes and other extra activities; and the last four hours were for language compe-\ntence (LC) tests and IC tests administered by external teachers other than the teachers\nwho were responsible for teaching the class.\nParticipants\nThe participants were forty-seven EFL learners from three elementary classes who were\nlearning General English at SEAMEO RETRAC in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. As can\nbe seen from Table 2, there was Just over half (53.2%) of the participants were aged under\n20, i.e., the participants were quite young. Additionally, around three-fifths (61.6%) of the\nparticipants were university students. That is why nearly seven in ten (68.1%) of the par-\nticipants had other high level qualifications or certificates (e.g., high school baccalaureate)\nother than bachelor ’s, master ’s, or doctoral degrees. Furthermore, a very large majority\n(78.7%) of the participants had previously studied English for over five years. Just over a\nthird (34%) of the participants reported that they had been abroad, and only a very small\nnumber (4.3%) of the participants had taken an intercultural course before. Detailed infor-\nmation on the participants is as follows:\nTextbook\nThe Four Corners textbook level 2, which is part of Four Corners series by Cambridge\nUniversity Press (Richards & Bohlke, 2012), was used in this project. This English text-\nbook is comprised of twelve units, yet for the first stage of the two in the elementary\nlevel in the General English program, only six topics from Unit One to Unit Six were\nTable 1 Distribution of teaching hours\nDetails Teacher 1 (Vietnamese) Teacher 2\n(Foreigner)\nExternal Teachers\n(Both)Teaching hours Regular lessons ICC lessons\n24 24 24 4\nTeaching components - Student book\nFour Corners 2A\n(Units 1, 3, & 5)\n- Student book\nFour Corners 2A\n- Additional intercultural\nmaterial (Units: 2, 4, & 6)\n- Language quizzes\n- IC quizzes\n- Extra activities\n- LC tests\n- IC tests\nTran and Duong Asian-Pacific Journal of Second and Foreign Language Education  (2018) 3:6 Page 6 of 17\ncovered. Apart from the core elements in the course syllabus designed by SEAMEO\nRETRAC, additional intercultural content was integrated into the course. As the pur-\npose of this experiment was to test the effectiveness of the proposed ICLT model, only\nthree intercultural themes ( Concept of beauty in different countries for Unit 2, Food\nand drink in different countries for Unit 4, & Body language in different countries for\nUnit 6 ) were integrated into the language content.\nResearch instruments\nThis project utilized three research instruments: language test, IC test and semi-\nstructured group interview in order to collect the data. The language test used to col-\nlect data on learners ’ LC was extracted from the assessment package for Four Corners\nlevel 2 by Cambridge University Press (Richards & Bohlke, 2012). There were two types\nof test: summative and formative. The former, as an achievement test, included written\nand oral tests: the written test (76 items) involved listening, reading, grammar, func-\ntional languages, and vocabulary; the oral test contained two main activities for pair\nwork. The latter, as a quiz, was also comprised of two tests: written (32 items) and oral\ntests which were in a similar format of the achievement test. The IC test was utilized to\ngenerate data on learners ’ IC. Akin to the language test, the IC test also included two\ntypes of test: summative and formative. The former, as an achievement test, was com-\nposed of forty multiple choice items (each of IC elements, namely intercultural\nTable 2 Research participants ’ general information\nN =4 7\nF%\nGender Male 16 34.0\nFemale 31 66.0\nAge Under 20 25 53.2\n21–30 18 38.3\n31–40 4 8.5\nOver 40 0 0.0\nJob Office worker 10 21.4\nUniversity Student 29 61.6\nSchool student 5 10.6\nOther 3 6.4\nHigher degrees Bachelor ’s 14 29.8\nMaster’s 1 2.1\nDoctorate 0 0.0\nOthers 32 68.1\nNumber of years ’ learning English Under 1 1 2.1\n1 – under 3 1 2.1\n3–5 8 17.0\nOver 5 37 78.7\nHave been abroad Yes 16 34.0\nNo 31 66.0\nHave taken an intercultural course Yes 2 4.3\nNo 45 95.7\nTran and Duong Asian-Pacific Journal of Second and Foreign Language Education  (2018) 3:6 Page 7 of 17\nknowledge, attitudes, awareness, & skills has 10 items, respectively). The latter, as a\nquiz, consisted of twenty multiple-choic e items (each of IC elements, namely inter-\ncultural knowledge, attitudes, awareness, a nd skills has 5 items, respectively). The\nsemi-structured group interview with three questions was employed to get in-depth\ninformation on participants ’effectiveness of the ICLT model.\nProcedures\nIn order to garner data, before the course, summative tests including language test and\nIC test were administered to forty-seven participants in three classes. During the\ncourse, forty-seven participants were required to do the formative tests (both language\ntest and IC test) after three ICC units. After the course, the same forty-seven participants\nwere delivered the same summative tests (language test and IC test). Nevertheless, only\nfifteen participants (around 32% of the population) who were chosen based on their will-\ningness for the semi-structured group interview, which was conducted in participants ’L1\nso that they did not encounter any difficulty in answering interview questions.\nWith respect to the data analysis, the statistical methods (descriptive statistics: fre-\nquency, means, & standard deviation; inferential statistics: paired-sample t-test) were\nemployed to analyze the quantitative analysis generated from the summative and for-\nmative tests. Meanwhile, the content analysis was utilized to analyze the qualitative\ndata collected from interviews. Each interviewee was coded with a cardinal number\nterms of L1, L2, and so on.\nSo as to increase the validity and reliability, all the research instruments were piloted\nbefore the main study. Furthermore, double-coding was employed in order to check\nand increase the reliability of the content analysis. Two methods for double-coding are\nintra-coder and inter-coder. For the intra-coding, the researcher chose three pieces of\ntext from the interview items which had been already coded to recode them. The re-\nsearcher checked the reliability which was set over 65%. Concerning the inter-coding,\nthe researcher had two scholars as inter-coders to recode three pieces of text from the\nopen-ended items. Then, the researcher compared his three coded texts with those\nfrom two inter-coders. The two inter-coders and the researcher reached to an agree-\nment level (83%) of reliability. As the interview transcriptions were in participants ’\nmother tongue, the researcher had to translate all the transcriptions into English. The\nresearcher then asked one teacher of English to double-check the accuracy of the trans-\nlated version.\nResults\nEFL learners ’ language competence\nIt can be seen from Table 3 that the results from the summative test reveal a significant\ndifference ( t = − 10.916; p = .000) regarding the EFL learners ’ LC, which denotes that\nEFL learners ’LC improved significantly after the thirteen-week course. With respect to\nthe pre-test score, the average mean score was 5.37 (out of 10), in which the mean\nscore of the pre-written test was 4.82 (out of 10), and that of the pre-oral test was 5.91\n(out of 10). Concerning the post-test, it is seen that the average mean score was 8.04\n(out of 10), in which the mean scores of the post-written test and the post-oral test\nwere 8.29 and 7.80 (out of 10), respectively. This means that after the course the\nTran and Duong Asian-Pacific Journal of Second and Foreign Language Education  (2018) 3:6 Page 8 of 17\nlearners’ oral score (speaking skills) had generally improved less than their written\nscores (listening, reading, grammar, functional language, and vocabulary).\nTwo types of lessons were used in this course: ICC lessons and regular lessons. The\nformer was the one into which IC was integrated, while the latter was the one in which\nonly language content was taught. There was one quiz taken at the end of each unit, so\nlearners had to take six quizzes (formative tests) in total, half of which were taken after\nthree units of ICC. However, for the purpose of this study, only the results of the three\nquizzes taken after the ICC lessons were included in the analysis.\nAs shown in Table 4, it is worth pointing out that of the three quizzes, quiz 2 ( X = 8.42)\nhad the highest mean score, then quiz 3 ( X = 8.24), and quiz 1 ( X = 7.77) had the lowest\nmean score. Similarly, the results of the summative and formative tests show that the\nmean scores of the written test (quiz 1: X = 8.09; quiz 2: X = 8.73; quiz 3: XX = 8.64)\nwere slightly higher than those of the oral test (quiz 1: X = 7.46; quiz 2: X = 8.10; quiz 3:\nX =7.84). Nevertheless, the scores of both the written test and the oral test had a similar\npattern of increase.\nFurthermore, Table 5 shows that the mean score of quiz 1 was statistically different\nfrom that of quiz 2 ( t = − 6.044; p = .000) and that of quiz 3 ( t = − 4.931; p = .000), but\nthere was no statistically significant difference in terms of the mean score of quiz 2 and\nquiz 3 ( t = 1.588; p = .119). Therefore, learners developed their LC during the intercul-\ntural language course. In other words, the learners ’ language performance improved as\na result of the ICC course.\nEFL learners ’ intercultural competence\nSimilar to the language test, the IC test also consisted of two types of test: a summative\nand a formative test. The former was the pre-test and post-test taken at the beginning\nand at the end of the course, respectively. The latter included three quizzes taken after\nthe units of the ICC lessons. Both the summative and the formative tests each had four\nmain parts, namely knowledge, attitudes, awareness, and skills.\nThe results from the summative test, as shown in Table 6, indicated that there was a\nsignificant improvement in learners ’ IC ( t = − 24.4444; p = .000) after the thirteen-week\nTable 3 EFL learners ’ LC - Summative test (Paired samples t-test)\nX t Sig.

In particular, it is worth pointing out that the pre-test mean score was nearly at\nan average level ( X = 4.72 out of 10) although a very large majority (95.7%; see section\n4.2) of the learners reported that they had never taken any intercultural course before.\nMoreover, it was found that at the beginning of the course the four components of IC,\nnamely, intercultural skills ( X = 4.85), intercultural attitudes ( X = 4.79), intercultural\nawareness ( X = 4.64), and intercultural knowledge ( X = 4.60) were in descending order;\nyet, after the course, learners got the highest score in intercultural knowledge ( X = 7.91),\nfollowed by the intercultural skills ( X = 7.77), intercultural attitudes ( X = 7.66), and inter-\ncultural awareness (X = 7.45). Overall, learners made a significant improvement in IC over\nthe thirteen-week course, but their intercultural knowledge was the most component that\nimproved most ( X = 3.31), while their intercultural awareness improved least ( X = 2.81).\nTurning to the results from the formative tests (Table 7), it can be in particular that\nthere was a slight improvement in participants ’ IC (quiz 1: X = 7.00; quiz 2: X = 7.35;\nquiz 3: X = 7.19 out of 10). Similar to the summative tests, knowledge was the most\nsignificantly improved component (quiz 1: X = 7.48; quiz 2: X = 7.74; quiz 3: X = 7.58)\nof the four IC components, and awareness was the least improved (quiz 1: X = 6.24;\nquiz 2: X = 6.72; quiz 3: X = 6.68). Additionally, all four IC components had the same\npattern of improvement through the three quizzes, i.e., the result of quiz 1 was the low-\nest and quiz 2 had the highest result. These results reveal that learners found intercul-\ntural knowledge and skills easier to improve than intercultural attitudes and awareness.\nThe results in Table 8 indicate that there was no statistically significant difference\nin respect of the mean scores of the two paired quizzes: quiz 1 and quiz 3 ( t = − 1.282;\np = .206); quiz 2 and quiz 3 ( t = .898; p = . 3 7 4 ) ,b u tt h em e a ns c o r eo fq u i z1w a ss t a -\ntistically different from that of quiz 2 ( t = − 2.018; p = .049). This means that learners ’\nIC development was relatively steady during the intercultural language course.\nWhen LC and IC were combined for further analysis, it was noticed that both LC\nand IC had a similar pattern of increase over a period of three months. At the begin-\nning of the course, the pre-test results (both IC and LC) were relatively high in\nTable 5 EFL learners ’ LC - Formative test (Paired differences- Paired samples t-test)\nX t Sig.\nPair 1 Quiz 1 - Quiz 2 −.65 −6.044 .000\nPair 2 Quiz 1 - Quiz 3 −.47 −4.931 .000\nPair 3 Quiz 2 - Quiz 3 .18 −1.588 .119\np ≤ .05\nTable 6 EFL learners ’ IC – Pre-test and Post-test (Paired samples t-test)\nX t Sig.

After the three-month course, as\nshown in Fig. 2, the learners ’level of ICC had improved despite the limited number of\nhours of study for intercultural language. It can be further seen that there was a rapid\nincrease in terms of the mean scores (both IC and LC) between the pre-test and quiz 1,\nand then there was a gradual development in learners ’ ICC towards the end of the\ncourse.\nIn order to triangulate the findings as well as to obtain in-depth information from\nthe quantitative data analysis, the qualitative data from the interview were also taken\ninto account. The findings reveal that the EFL learners ’ ICC gradually changed posi-\ntively over the course.\nA number of interviewees (26.7%) confided that although they had spent years on\nlearning English before, their English was not really at a high level due to their dislike\nof this subject in high school. When they took this course, albeit their IC markedly im-\nproved, they felt that their English had not improved much. However, their improve-\nment in English met the level required by the course objectives.\nIn this course, I liked learning about other cultures, and it helps to me learn English\nas well as other cultures although my English is improved a little, but I know more\nabout English and other cultures (L3).\nWhen I was at high school, I did not want to study English much. Therefore, I was\nnot really good at English. Now my English is still weak, but I can feel my English is\nimproved, especially my knowledge of different cultures (L7).\nSome (20%) also said that their IC improved more than their LC because they paid\nmore attention to the cultural content while studying on the course.\nI prefer cultural content to English, so I know more about cultures. My English is\ndeveloped a little (L4).\nTable 7 EFL learners ’ IC - Formative test\nItems ( N = 47) Quiz 1 Quiz 2 Quiz 3\nX (SD) X (SD) X (SD)\nKnowledge 7.48 (1.03) 7.74 (.90) 7.58 (.75)\nAttitudes 6.98 (.66) 7.40 (.86) 7.24 (.53)\nAwareness 6.24 (.78) 6.72 (.67) 6.68 (.67)\nSkills 7.14 (.68) 7.53 (.76) 7.24 (.61)\nAverage 7.00 (.69) 7.35 (.90) 7.19 (.81)\nTable 8 EFL learners ’ IC - Formative test (Paired differences- Paired samples t-test)\nX t Sig.\nPair 1 Quiz 1 - Quiz 2 -.35 - 2.018 .049\nPair 2 Quiz 1 - Quiz 3 −.19 - 1.282 .206\nPair 3 Quiz 2 - Quiz 3 .16 .898 .374\np ≤ .05\nTran and Duong Asian-Pacific Journal of Second and Foreign Language Education  (2018) 3:6 Page 11 of 17\nFurther to this, one interviewee commented that when at high school, she was unaware\nwhether it was necessary to learn cultures when learning English. Nor was she in favor of\nlearning English. Nevertheless, when she came on this course, she realized that it helped\nto change her attitudes toward learning English as well as to improve her ICC.\nI used to learn English in order to pass English exams, so I did not pay attention\nmuch to language skills. Besides, I did not care whether I should learn cultures when\nlearning English or not. However, during this course I realized that it was interesting\nto learn cultures through learning English. Consequently, I feel that my ICC is\nimproved quite a lot (L5).\nMeanwhile, many others (40%) confirmed that they had developed both their LC and\nIC over the course. Moreover, they expressed their hope that they would be able to\nhave similar courses in the future as they thought that using English appropriately was\nimportant for their jobs. Just one of many examples is as follows:\nAfter this course, my English is better and I know more about other cultures. I hope\nthat there will be more similar courses because it is very important for me to know\nand use English in an appropriate way. English is important for my job (L14).\nRegarding the specific elements of IC, a considerable number (73.3%) of those inter-\nviewed reported that their intercultural knowledge improved a lot. Two of them said:\nI know different things about concepts of beauty, foods and drinks and body\nlanguages of different cultures (L7).\n… my understanding other cultures is better as I know more about other cultures\nand my own (L15).\nThey additionally commented that their intercultural attitudes and awareness were\npositively changed. One shared:\n… my attitudes toward other cultures have been adjusted because I understand more\nabout other cultures, especially cultural difference (L11).\nFig. 2 EFL learners ’ ICC. This figure belongs to the finding of this study\nTran and Duong Asian-Pacific Journal of Second and Foreign Language Education  (2018) 3:6 Page 12 of 17\nTheir intercultural skills were also remarkably developed. They reported that they\nknew how to avoid cultural misunderstanding and conflict as they had learned different\nstrategies for IC and knew how to use English more effectively and appropriately in in-\ntercultural situations.\n… I know how to use appropriate English in different situations … I know how to\navoid cultural misunderstanding (L5).\n… I know how to communicate well when I meet them. I know how to avoid conflict or\nat least I know some strategies when talking to foreigners when I first meet them (L8).\n… I know how to use English effectively and appropriately in intercultural situations.\nI know different strategies for IC (L9).\nOn the other hand, it was noticeable that quite a small number (13.3%) of those\ninterviewed stated that although this type of course was of interest, they would have\npreferred to learn English rather than culture since their English language skills were\nstill weak. They wanted to focus more on their grammar, and that is why their IC had\nnot improved much. The most obvious example of this view is:\nTo me, it is very interesting to learn both culture and English in English lessons, but\nI don ’t want to spend much time on learning different cultures because my English\nis not very good. I want to improve my English grammar and skills. Therefore, after\nthis course I do not feel much improvement in my IC (L10).\nDiscussion\nThe results from the LC summative tests reveal that there was a significant improve-\nment in EFL learners ’ LC after the thirteen-week ICC course. This means that the\nlearners were able to improve their LC while l earning intercultural content. It is likely\nthat learners were aware of the important roles of English language and English lan-\nguage learning in the context of globalizat ion. Furthermore, learners in this study\nwere those who had a strong will to improve their English language proficiency be-\ncause they took the English training course b y choice as an extra course at a language\ncenter.\nSpecifically, it was seen that learners ’ oral scores (speaking skill) did not improve as\nmuch as their written scores (listening, reading, grammar, functional languages, and vo-\ncabulary) by the end of the course. Nonetheless, the results also show that learners ’\nspeaking skills at the beginning of the course were relatively good in comparison with\nthe required level for the course. It may be understood from this that learners ’speaking\nskills which were at a high level did not develop much after the course because it takes\na long time for learners to improve their speaking skills. Also, some learners find speak-\ning skills the most difficult to be develop as pointed by many scholars (e.g., Pawlak,\nWaniek-Klimczak, & Majer, 2011; Waniek-Klimczak & Klimczak, 2008). It is generally\nTran and Duong Asian-Pacific Journal of Second and Foreign Language Education  (2018) 3:6 Page 13 of 17\nagreed that speaking skills are the most difficult to improve of the four macro skills (lis-\ntening, speaking, reading, and writing).\nAs for the results from the LC formative tests (quizzes) obtained after the ICC les-\nsons, it was found that learners ’ LC progressed gradually during the course, albeit the\nlearners’ pre-test scores ( X = 5.37) were at a high starting point. Yet, the results from\nthe three LC quizzes showed that progress fluctuated in terms of the mean scores (quiz 1:\nX = 7.77; quiz 2: X = 8.42; quiz 3: X = 8.24), and there was a similar pattern of increase in\nboth the oral and written tests of the three LC formative tests. Furthermore, there were\ndifferences in terms of mean scores between quiz 1 and quiz 2; quiz 1 and 3, but there\nwas no difference in terms of mean scores between quiz 2 and quiz 3. This indicates a\nconsiderable improvement in learners ’ LC at different times: from quiz 1 to quiz 2, and\nfrom quiz 1 to quiz 3. Possibly, the degree of difficulty of three quizzes was different from\none another, although the test items in each quiz reflected the language content of each\nunit.\nThe quantitative findings from the IC summative tests indicated that learners ’IC im-\nproved significantly, i.e., the ICC training course helped learners to improve their IC\nafter three months. One of the possible explanations is that learners had positive per-\nceptions of ICLT, so they were motivated to learn the intercultural content through\nlearning the language content. Furthermore, learners were aware that IC is becoming\npart of the necessary professional skills required for future jobs, and they understood\nthat IC had the “capacity to change one ’s knowledge, attitudes and behaviors so as to\nbe open and flexible to other cultures has become a critical issue for individuals to sur-\nvive in the globalized society of the twenty-first century ” (Davis, 2005, p. 4). As a result,\nthey became more aware of their learning needs during the course.\nWith respect to the IC formative tests (quizzes), the findings indicated that learners\ndeveloped relatively gradually. The mean scores of the three IC quizzes fluctuated\nslightly (quiz 1: X = 7.00; quiz 2: X = 7.35; quiz 3: X = 7.19), and there was only a dif-\nference in terms of the mean scores between quiz 1 and quiz 2. The reason for this\nmay be due to the degree of difficulty of each quiz. As three intercultural themes\n(Concept of Beauty in different countries for Unit 2, Food and Drink in different coun-\ntries for Unit 4, and Body Language in different countries for Unit 6) were integrated\ninto the English language units, the interc ultural themes for Units 1 and 3 were quite\nabstract and new to learners while the theme for Unit 2 was visual and more familiar\nto the learners. The four IC components (int ercultural knowledge, attitudes, aware-\nness, & skills) developed significantly in a similar pattern. Nevertheless, the order of\nimprovement of learners ’ IC components was intercultural knowledge, skills, atti-\ntudes, and awareness. This means that the most significantly improved IC component\nwas intercultural knowledge whilst the least significantly improved was intercultural\nawareness. This may be that intercultur al knowledge is easier to acquire than the\nother IC components. Therefore, learners developed their intercultural knowledge\nmost and their intercultural awareness least.\nThe findings from the qualitative data analysis showed that learners developed their\nICC (both LC and IC) significantly. In addition, learners were motivated to study on this\nintercultural language course, so that they could expand their worldviews. These re-\nsults match those of previous studies (e.g., O ’Neil, 2008;S h o m a n ,2011;G ó m e z ,2012;\nOttoson, 2013). A representative example of this is that Shoman ( 2011) conducted a\nTran and Duong Asian-Pacific Journal of Second and Foreign Language Education  (2018) 3:6 Page 14 of 17\nstudy using a framework to develop ICC and the proficiency of advanced learners of\nArabic. The findings revealed that the pro posed linguacultural framework not only\ndeveloped learners ’ abilities to recognize as well as produce Arabic varieties used in\nEgypt but also fostered their IC abilities (kno wledge, attitude, awareness, & skills). In\nanother context, O ’Neil ( 2008) conducted research on fostering learners ’ IC by imple-\nmenting an interactional virtual elementary classroom, and found that learners developed\ntheir LC, specifically their writing skills through the course, and that there were positive\nchanges in learners ’ IC. Therefore, the ICC training course not only improved learners ’\nLC, but also developed their IC significantly.\nNotwithstanding, it was also revealed that some learners who developed their ICC,\nalso improved their IC more than their LC and vice versa. It may be the case that these\nlearners focused more on either LC or IC of ICC during the ICC training course. For\nthose whose LC improved the most, although their English language proficiency was\nstill weak, they thought that it was more important to improve their LC than their IC.\nOn the contrary, for those whose IC was more developed, intercultural learning was\nnew to them as most (95.7%) of the learners had never taken an intercultural course\nbefore, and they were more interested in IC because of its important role in communi-\ncation. Consequently, their LC and IC were not developed simultaneously at a similarly\nhigh level.\nConclusion\nThe study showed that the ICLT model was seen an effective form of intercultural language\neducation to facilitate the achievement of learners ’ICC (both LC and IC). Generally, both\nthe learners’ LC and IC developed in a similar pattern, which indicates that learners can\nlearn intercultural content through language content and vice versa. This study might sug-\ngest that in a long term the ICLT model can equip learners with ICC in order to become\nintercultural speakers who can be fluent in a foreign language and function appropriately\nand effectively in the context of globalization. However, in order to make the ICLT happen\nin the Vietnamese context, there should be radical changes in teaching methodology which\nshifts its current approach to intercultura l language approach. The ICLT model should be\nexperimented at various educational levels in different contexts in order to further confirm\nthe effectiveness of this model. Additionally, different supportive factors on learners ’ ICC\ndevelopment should be scrutinized so as to facilitate the process of learners ’intercultural\nlanguage learning.\nAbbreviations\nEFL: English as a foreign language; ESL: English as a second language; IC: Intercultural competence; ICC: Intercultural\ncommunicative competence; ICLT: Intercultural communicative language teaching; LC: Language competence;\nSEAMEO RETRAC: SouthEast Asian Ministers of Education Organisation, Regional Training Center; TESOL: Teaching\nEnglish to speakers of other languages\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors ’ acknowledgements would go extensively to all anonymous participants for their willingness to participate\nin this study, reviewing experts for their constructive suggestions as well as comments, and the Board of directors of\nSEAMEO RETRAC for their consent to conduct the experiment at their language center.
