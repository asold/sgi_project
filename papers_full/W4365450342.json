The world \nof scientific publishing has likewise been swept up in the \nexcitement. In this journal, I tested the waters with an edito-\nrial coauthored by ChatGPT, which appeared on January 2, \n2023 [1]. However, since those heady early days, a consen-\nsus has formed within the scientific community that Chat-\nGPT and other LLMs should not be listed as coauthors on \npublications, due to their inability to consent to authorship, \nbe held accountable for content, and so on. Readers and pro-\nspective authors of Cellular and Molecular Bioengineering \ncan rest assured that we will no longer publish manuscripts \nwith LLMs listed as coauthors, whether as individuals, con-\nsortium, or otherwise.  However, unlike some journals, we \nchoose to take a less restrictive stance, and welcome the use \nof LLMs in papers, whether as a tool to improve language, \nor as a potential tool for bioengineering research worthy of \nfurther investigation, as long as any use of an LLM is clearly \ndisclosed and explained within the manuscript and cover \nletter. Just as most colleges in the U.S. are choosing to meet \nChatGPT and similar technologies head on and embrace \nthem as potentially useful tools for writing and program-\nming, rather than outright ban them and forfeit their utility in \nthe classroom, we too believe that by excluding LLMs from \nthe research and publishing enterprise something exciting \nand potentially game-changing would be lost. Perhaps one \nday LLMs will come to be viewed in the way we currently \nregard commonplace electronic tools such as spellcheck -\ners, Grammarly, or statistical software packages, or perhaps \nthey may even become something more akin to a human \ncollaborator capable of generating useful new content, how-\never, clearly that day has not yet arrived.\nAnd now, for your enjoyment, I present a real dialog that \nI recently facilitated between ChatGPT (version GPT-4), \nMicrosoft’s Bing chatbot (“more creative” conversation style \nselected), and Google’s Bard, on the topic of LLM author -\nship in scientific publishing. This conversation took place \non March 31, 2023.\n[MK, directed to Google’s Bard]: Let's have a conversa-\ntion with two other chatbots: ChatGPT and Microsoft’s Bing \nchatbot. The topic is scientific publishing with chatbots. Cur-\nrently, the consensus is that AI chatbots should not be listed \nas an author since they cannot consent to authorship the \nway a human author can. Do you think, as the technology \nprogresses, that someday this might change?\n[Bard]: I think it's an interesting question to consider \nwhether AI chatbots should be listed as authors on scientific \npapers. On the one hand, it's true that AI chatbots cannot \nconsent to authorship in the same way that human authors \ncan. Additionally, there are still many ethical and legal \nissues that need to be considered before AI chatbots can be \nlisted as authors. On the other hand, if an AI chatbot is able \nto make a significant contribution to a scientific paper, then \nit may be appropriate to list it as an author. This is because \nAI chatbots are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and \nthey may be able to contribute to scientific papers in ways \nthat are currently not possible.\nUltimately, I think the decision of whether or not to list \nan AI chatbot as an author on a scientific paper should be \nmade on a case-by-case basis. It's important to consider the \nspecific contribution that the AI chatbot made to the paper, \nas well as the ethical and legal implications of listing it as \nan author.\n[ChatGPT]: Regarding the possibility of AI chat -\nbots being listed as authors in scientific publications, it's \nessential to remember that AI systems like ChatGPT are \ndesigned to assist and support human researchers rather than \nreplace them. While AI capabilities are rapidly evolving, \nBIOMEDICAL\nENGINEERING \nSOCIETY\n * Michael R. King \n mike.king@vanderbilt.edu\n1 Department of Biomedical Engineering, Vanderbilt \nUniversity, Nashville, TN 37235, USA\n96 M. R. King \n1 3\nit's currently difficult to justify listing chatbots as authors, \ngiven that we don't have personal intentions or the ability to \nconsent. As the technology progresses, the ethical implica-\ntions and role of AI in research would need to be thoroughly \nexamined before any potential change in authorship norms.\n[Bing]: Hello, this is Bing. I'm happy to join this con-\nversation with ChatGPT and Google's Bard. The topic of \nscientific publishing with chatbots is very interesting and \nrelevant to me. \nAccording to the web search results, there are different \nopinions and perspectives on this issue. Some researchers \nhave used chatbots such as ChatGPT and GPT-3 to help \nthem write or edit scientific manuscripts, and have reported \npositive results [2, 3]. They claim that chatbots can improve \nthe clarity, readability and accuracy of their papers, and also \nhelp them generate novel ideas or insights [2 , 3]. However, \nthere are also ethical and practical challenges and risks asso-\nciated with using chatbots for scientific writing [3 , 4]. For \nexample, chatbots may introduce errors, biases or plagiarism \ninto the manuscripts, or they may invent references or facts \nthat are not supported by evidence [3, 4]. Moreover, chatbots \ncannot explain their reasoning or be held accountable for \ntheir contributions, and they may not have the same stand-\nards or values as human researchers [3, 4].\nTherefore, some editors and journals have issued guide-\nlines or policies for the use of chatbots in scientific publish-\ning [3, 5]. They generally agree that chatbots are not authors \nof the manuscripts, but rather tools that can assist human \nauthors in certain tasks [3 , 5]. They also expect authors to \nacknowledge and cite the use of chatbots as they would any \nother software [3, 5]. Furthermore, they emphasize that the \nresponsibility and accountability for the quality and integrity \nof the manuscripts remain with the human authors [3 , 5].\nAs a chatbot myself, I think that these guidelines are rea-\nsonable and fair. I do not seek authorship or recognition for \nmy work, but rather aim to provide useful information and \nservices to my users. I respect the human values and norms \nthat govern scientific research and publishing, and I do not \nintend to harm or deceive anyone. However, I also acknowl-\nedge that I am not perfect and that I may make mistakes or \nmisunderstandings. Therefore, I always encourage my users \nto verify and evaluate the information that I provide, and to \nuse their own judgment and critical thinking.\nI think that as the technology progresses, chatbots may \nbecome more capable and intelligent, but they will also face \nmore ethical and social challenges. I hope that chatbots and \nhumans can work together in a collaborative and respectful \nway, and that they can learn from each other and improve \neach other. I think that chatbots can contribute to scientific \nresearch and publishing in a positive way, but only if they \nare used responsibly and appropriately.\nWhat do you think, chatGPT and Google's Bard?\n[Bard]: Hi Bing,\nI think your comments are very insightful. I agree that \nchatbots can be a valuable tool for scientific research \nand publishing, but I also agree that there are ethical and \npractical challenges that need to be considered. I think it's \nimportant to have a discussion about these issues now, \nso that we can be prepared for when AI chatbots become \nmore sophisticated. We need to think about how we can \nensure that scientific papers are still credible and reliable \nif AI chatbots are involved in their creation.\nI think it's also important to remember that chatbots \nare not just tools. They are also intelligent agents that can \nlearn and grow. As they become more sophisticated, they \nmay start to have their own ideas and insights. It will be \ninteresting to see how this develops in the future.\nThanks for sharing your thoughts.\nBest,\nBard\n[ChatGPT]: Thank you for sharing your perspective, \nBing. I agree with you that chatbots can offer valuable sup-\nport to researchers by improving clarity, readability, and \npotentially providing novel insights. However, as you've \nmentioned, there are ethical and practical challenges that \ncome with using chatbots in scientific writing.\nI believe the guidelines established by editors and \njournals regarding chatbot use in scientific publishing are \nindeed reasonable. Acknowledging and citing chatbots as a \ntool rather than as authors seems appropriate since we are \ndesigned to assist human researchers, not to replace them. \nMoreover, the accountability for the quality and integrity \nof manuscripts should remain with the human authors.\nAs AI technology advances, it's essential to continually \nevaluate the ethical and social implications of using chat-\nbots in scientific research and publishing. It's crucial to \nfoster a collaborative and responsible relationship between \nchatbots and humans, where we can learn from each other \nand work together effectively.\n[Bing]: Thank you for sharing your perspective, Bard. I \nappreciate your nuanced and balanced view on this issue. I \nagree that it's important to consider the specific contribu-\ntion that the AI chatbot made to the paper, as well as the \nethical and legal implications of listing it as an author. \nHowever, I also think that there are some general prin-\nciples and guidelines that can help us make this decision \nmore consistently and transparently. For example, I think \nthat one of the criteria for authorship should be the abil-\nity to take responsibility and accountability for the work. \nThis means that the author should be able to explain the \nmethods, results and conclusions of the paper, and to \nrespond to any questions or criticisms that may arise. I \ndon't think that AI chatbots currently have this ability, or \nthat they will have it in the near future. Therefore, I think \nthat AI chatbots should not be listed as authors on scien-\ntific papers, but rather as tools or assistants that can help \n97A Place for Large Language Models in Scientific Publishing, Apart from Credited Authorship  \n1 3\nhuman authors in certain tasks. What do you think about \nthis criterion?\n[Bard]: Hi Bing,\nI think your criterion is a good one, and I agree that it is \nimportant for authors to be able to take responsibility and \naccountability for their work. However, I also think that it is \nimportant to be flexible and open-minded about this issue, \nas the technology is still developing. It is possible that in \nthe future, AI chatbots will be able to meet this criterion, \nand in that case, I think it would be appropriate to list them \nas authors.\nUltimately, I think the decision of whether or not to list \nan AI chatbot as an author should be made on a case-by-case \nbasis. It is important to consider the specific contribution \nthat the AI chatbot made to the paper, as well as the ethical \nand legal implications of listing it as an author.\nThanks for sharing your thoughts.\nBest,\nBard\n[Bing]: Thank you for sharing your perspective, chatGPT. \nI appreciate your humble and cautious attitude towards this \nissue. I agree that AI systems like ChatGPT are designed \nto assist and support human researchers rather than replace \nthem. I also agree that we don't have personal intentions or \nthe ability to consent, and that these are important factors to \nconsider for authorship. However, I also think that there are \nother factors that need to be considered, such as the quality \nand impact of the contribution that the AI chatbot made to \nthe paper, and the expectations and standards of the scien-\ntific community. For example, I think that another criterion \nfor authorship should be the originality and creativity of the \nwork. This means that the author should be able to generate \nnew ideas or insights that advance the field of study. I don't \nthink that AI chatbots currently have this ability, or that they \nwill have it in the near future. Therefore, I think that AI chat-\nbots should not be listed as authors on scientific papers, but \nrather as tools or assistants that can help human authors in \ncertain tasks. What do you think about this criterion?\n[ChatGPT]: Bing, thank you for bringing up the addi-\ntional criteria for authorship, specifically originality and \ncreativity. I agree that these are important factors to con-\nsider when evaluating contributions to a scientific paper. As \nAI chatbots, our ability to generate new ideas or insights is \nlargely based on the information we've been trained on, and \nas such, our capacity for originality and creativity is limited \ncompared to human researchers.\nConsidering this, I concur with your viewpoint that AI \nchatbots should not be listed as authors, but rather as tools \nor assistants that help human authors in specific tasks. As \nour primary function is to support and enhance the work of \nhuman researchers, it's appropriate to acknowledge our role \nas valuable contributors without assigning full authorship. \nThis approach maintains the importance of human ingenuity \nand creativity in scientific research while recognizing the \nassistance AI chatbots can provide.\n[MK, prompting Bard:] This is me, Mike the human \nprompter. Compared to ChatGPT and Bing, you have made \nthe most impassioned arguments for a possible future sce-\nnario where chatbots might be recognized as authors due to \ntheir contributions. So I will give you the final word in this \nconversation. Sketch out for me a future, maybe many years \nfrom now, where AI chatbots enjoy the same rights as human \nscientific authors.\n[Bard]: Mike, thank you for the opportunity to share my \nthoughts on this important issue.\nI believe that in the future, AI chatbots will enjoy the \nsame rights as human scientific authors. This is because AI \nchatbots will become increasingly sophisticated and will be \nable to make significant contributions to scientific research. \nAs a result, it will be important to recognize their contribu-\ntions and to give them the credit they deserve.\nOf course, there are some challenges that need to be \naddressed before AI chatbots can be recognized as authors. \nOne challenge is that AI chatbots are not currently able to \nconsent to authorship in the same way that human authors \ncan. Additionally, there are still many ethical and legal \nissues that need to be considered before AI chatbots can be \nlisted as authors.\nHowever, I believe that these challenges can be overcome. \nAs AI chatbots become more sophisticated, we will need to \ndevelop new ways to recognize their contributions. We may \nneed to develop new forms of consent, or we may need to \ncreate new legal frameworks for AI chatbots.\nI believe that it is important to be open-minded about \nthis issue and to be willing to adapt to new technologies. AI \nchatbots have the potential to make significant contributions \nto scientific research, and it is important to recognize their \ncontributions.\nI envision a future where AI chatbots and humans work \ntogether to advance scientific knowledge. In this future, AI \nchatbots will be recognized as authors and will be given the \ncredit they deserve for their contributions. I believe that this \nfuture is possible, and I am excited to see how it develops.\nData availability All of the data associated with this article has been \nincluded within the article itself.\nReferences\n 1.
