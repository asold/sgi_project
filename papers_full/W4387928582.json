  "abstract": "Narrative construction is the process of representing disparate event\\ninformation into a logical plot structure that models an end to end story.\\nIntelligence analysis is an example of a domain that can benefit tremendously\\nfrom narrative construction techniques, particularly in aiding analysts during\\nthe largely manual and costly process of synthesizing event information into\\ncomprehensive intelligence reports. Manual intelligence report generation is\\noften prone to challenges such as integrating dynamic event information,\\nwriting fine-grained queries, and closing information gaps. This motivates the\\ndevelopment of a system that retrieves and represents critical aspects of\\nevents in a form that aids in automatic generation of intelligence reports.\\n We introduce a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to augment\\nprompting of an autoregressive decoder by retrieving structured information\\nasserted in a knowledge graph to generate targeted information based on a\\nnarrative plot model. We apply our approach to the problem of neural\\nintelligence report generation and introduce FABULA, framework to augment\\nintelligence analysis workflows using RAG. An analyst can use FABULA to query\\nan Event Plot Graph (EPG) to retrieve relevant event plot points, which can be\\nused to augment prompting of a Large Language Model (LLM) during intelligence\\nreport generation. Our evaluation studies show that the plot points included in\\nthe generated intelligence reports have high semantic relevance, high\\ncoherency, and low data redundancy.\\n",
