Introduction \nElectrical energy is one of the most important factors for socio-economic growth [1]. Electrical energy \nis transmitted to consumers after the processes of generation, transmission, and distribution [ 2]. \nStability of the electrical power system mainly depends on the working of the transfo rmer. The \nefficiency of the distribution transformers is between 98 and 99 percent [3]. Even with the 98% of the \nefficiency, distribution transformers cause the major loss in the distribution system because \ntransformers work all the 24 hours of the day and even 2% of energy loss can cause significant financial \ndamage to the electric providers. There are two main types of losses in the transformer i.e. load losses \nand no-load losses. \nLoad losses are also known as copper losses. T hese losses are mainly due to the absorption of the \nactive power by the transformer while carrying rated current in the winding. These  losses are also \nknown as short circuit losses because, during the calculation of the load losses , secondary windings \nremain short-circuited. \nNo-load l osses are also known as iron or constant losses . No-load losses are initiated by the \nmagnetization current , which is required to energize the core of the transformer. Iron losses are \nindependent of the load losses. For no-load losses rated voltage is applied to the primary winding and \nthe secondary winding remains open circuit . The no -load losses include  the eddy current loss , the \nInternational Journal of Engineering & Applied Sciences (IJEAS) \nVol.9, Issue 3 (2017) 11-21 \nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.24107/ijeas.309933 \nInt J Eng Appl Sci 9(3) (2017) 11-21 \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n    \n \nK.Dawood, M.A.Cinar,B. Alboyacı, O. Sönmez \n12 \n \nhysteresis loss, and the dielectric loss  [4-6]. I2R losses are negligible for the no -load losses because \nduring the open circuit, current is very small as compared to the short-circuit current. \nPno-load = Pe+Ph+Pd      (1) \nEddy current and hysteresis losses contribute almost 99% of the iron losses. These two components \ncould be extracted as [7]; \nPh=khfBn       (2) \nPe=kef2B2       (3) \nNo-load losses also depend on the construction of the core. Magnetic induction is not constant on the \ndifferent parts of the core, thus power losses also vary locally depending on the Eq. (2) and Eq. (3), on \nthe transformer core. Therefore, accurate calculation and minimization of the no-load losses are one \nof the most difficult challenges for the transformer designers [8].  \nFinite element method is one of the most efficient numerical methods for the calculation of no-load \nand load losses of the transformers [7]. In [9] and [10], no-load losses were analyzed and compared \nwith different grade core materials. Due to the electromagnetic parameters of the materials, finite \nelement analysis provides easiness with high accuracy. Stray losses occurred in  the different parts of \nthe transformer, such as core clamps, walls , and top-plates of the tank, etc., can be calculated easily \nusing FEA [ 11, 12, 13]. Similarly, efficiencies of different shielding and shunting applications for \nlosses caused by leakage fl uxes were defined in [ 14, 15, 16]. In all these studies, one of the mai n \ndrawbacks is to model the studied transformer and its components accurately. While coarse modeling \nincreases the relative error of the results, but excessive details in modeling increases the solution time. \nThe main objective of this study is to compare the different numerical models for the calculation of \nthe no-load losses. 3-dimensional and 2-dimensional finite element analyses  models are used for the \ncalculation of the no -load losses. Simulation results are also compared with the experimental \nmeasurements. \n2.

FEM based no-load losses computation \nFinite element methods are versatile and most commonly used numerical method among researchers \nand practitioners to solve complex problems in engineering and science [ 18]. FEM is a numerical \ntechnique which commonly used for the simulation of differential and integral equations. FEM is \nmostly used to determine the electromagnetic, magnetostatic, and thermal character istics of the \nmaterials. In this study, no -load losses o f the transformer are calculated by using ANSYS Maxwell \nfinite element analysis software. \nFig. 5, Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 show the 3-D full model, 2-D full model and 2-D half model of the studied \ntransformer under mesh operation.

The percentage difference between the 3-D full model and experimental result is 2.6%. Fig. \n15 shows the no-load losses during the simulation of the 2-D full model of the transformer and relative \nerror between 2-D full model and experimental result is  11.88%. The percentage difference is higher \nin 2-D full model as compared to the 3-D full model. However 2-D full model consumes less time as \ncompared to the 3-D full model. Fig. 16 shows the no-load losses during the simulation of the 2-D half \nmodel and the percentage difference between the 2-D half model and experimental result is 12.22%. \nThe percentage difference between the analytical and experimental method is 4.29%. \n5.
