INTRODUCTION\nThe new technologies of mobile wireless communications, especially\nthe design of multi-frequency antenna arrays attracted much attention\nand interest in multi-frequency power dividers. In the case of three\nor more antenna elements, N-way multi-frequency power dividers are\nused to feed antenna elements. In this paper, a simple technique is\nused to design N-way multi-frequency unequal split Wilkinson power\ndividers (WPDs). The proposed technique is based on the equivalent\n2-way model [1, 2]. This model is analyzed using the even-odd mode\nanalysis [3]. The most important characteristics of the conventional\nWilkinson power dividers are achieved; high isolation between output\nports, and input/output ports matching at the desired frequencies.\nVery recently, a couple of papers have been published [4, 5] in\nwhich the analysis was carried to design N-way dual-frequency equal\nCorresponding author: N. I. Dib (nihad@just.edu.jo).\n116 Qaroot and Dib\nsplit WPD. It should be emphasized that the proposed WPDs in [4, 5]\nwere equal split and dual-frequency ones. In our paper, we consider\nthe general design of unequal split, multi-frequency (dual, triple, and\nquad) WPDs. Another interesting paper [6] discussed the design\nof dual-frequency unequal split N-way WPD with planar isolation\nresistors. Several structures have been also proposed to design three-\nway Wilkinson power dividers. Jui [7] proposed the use of coupled line\nimpedance transformers in the middle section of the divider to couple\nthe input signal and to provide impedance transformation function\nto the output signals. Equal power split was only achieved. Also,\nas the number of the output ports increases, the complexity of the\nanalysis increases, and multi-frequency operations were not considered.\nAnother planar dual-frequency three-way WPD was proposed in [8].\nThe structure was a modiﬁed version of Nagai hybrid power divider [9].\nEach transmission line section was replaced by two transmission line\nsections to account for dual-frequency operations. Unfortunately, the\nisolation performance between the output ports was not considered,\nand the output ports matching conditions were neglected. Based on\nthe same concept, Wang [10] proposed the use of an RLC circuit instead\nof using a single resistor to enhance the isolation performance between\nthe output ports. However, the problem of output ports matching was\nnot solved in [10]. In [11], Cheng presented the design of a planar\nsix-way power divider using folded and hybrid expanded coupled lines.\nMulti-frequency operation and unequal power split were not discussed.\nMoreover, many researchers investigated the design of 2-way dual-\nfrequency Wilkinson power divider with equal [12, 13] and unequal [14–\n18] output power split ratio. To our knowledge, none of these topologies\nhave been extended to N-way unequal split Wilkinson power dividers.\nThe simplicity of our proposed structure makes it applicable to\ndesign and implement N-way multi-frequency unequal split WPD. The\nproposed structure is similar to the original Wilkinson divider [19]. The\nmulti-frequency operation is accomplished by replacing the quarter-\nwave branches of the conventional N-way Wilkinson power divider by\ntransmission line transformers consisting of two sections (in the case of\ndual-frequency), three sections (in the case of triple-frequency divider)\nor four sections (in the case of quad-frequency divider).\n2. ANALYSIS OF CONVENTIONAL 2-WAY WPD\nThe even-odd mode analysis presented in this section is similar to that\npresented in [3] which was used to design and analyze 2-way unequal\nsplit Wilkinson power dividers. This analysis will be brieﬂy presented\nhere since it is widely used throughout this paper after reducing an\nProgress In Electromagnetics Research C, Vol. 14, 2010 117\nN-way WPD to its equivalent 2-way model. The 2-way unequal split\nWPD is shown in Figure 1, wherek2 = P3/P2 [3].\n0Z\n02Z\n03Z R''\nkZ /0\nkZ0\neV2 oV2\neV3 oV3\nR'\n4 /λ Port 2\nSymmetry\n   plane\nPort 1\nPort 3\nFigure 1. 2-way unequal split WPD.\neV2\neV3\nkZ /0\nkZ00kZR' =\nkZR'' = /0\n)1 ( 2\n002 kkZZ +=\n2\n0203 / kZZ =\n)1 ( 2\n0 kZ +\n)1( 2\n2\n0\nk\nkZ +\nFigure 2.

Odd mode excitation equivalent circuit.\n118 Qaroot and Dib\n2.1. Even Mode Excitation\nFor the even-mode excitation,V2e = V3e, and V2o = V3o = 0. Thus,\nthere is no current ﬂow through the resistors (R′, R′′) or the short\ncircuit between the inputs of the two transmission lines at port 1. So,\nthe network of Figure 1 can be bisected with open circuits at these\npoints to obtain the equivalent network shown in Figure 2.\n2.2. Odd Mode Excitation\nFor the odd-mode excitation,V3o = −V2o, and V2e = V3e = 0. This\nresults in a voltage null along the middle of Figure 1. Thus, this circuit\ncan be bisected by grounding it at two points on its midplane to give\nthe equivalent network shown in Figure 3.\nUsing the above analysis the design of conventional 2-way unequal\nsplit WPD is obtained. Furthermore, equal split can be obtained by\nsubstituting k2 = 1.\n3. DESIGN OF N-WAY SINGLE-FREQUENCY\nUNEQUAL SPLIT WPD\nFor an N-way WPD, the above even-odd mode analysis can be used\nafter reducing the N-way WPD to its equivalent 2-way model similar\nto the analysis of equal split N-way divider presented in [1, 2]. In this\nequivalent 2-way model, the ﬁrst branch represents thenth-branch and\nthe second branch represents the combination of the remainingN − 1\nbranches. The analysis of an N-way WPD starts by assigning the power\nsplit ratio to each output port, then applying the combining technique\nto ﬁnd the parameters of eachnth-branch. The equivalent 2-way WPD\nconsists of thenth-branch with its pre-assigned power split ratio, and\nanother branch, which is the sum of the power ratios of the restN −1\nbranches. The nth-branch parameters are the ones of interest, while\nthe combined branch parameters are not of interest. This process is\nrepeated until the parameters of all theN original branches are found.\nThe case is much easier for equal split WPD since the power split ratio\nbetween all the output ports are equal, and thus the equivalent 2-way\nmodel have to be done only once.\nTo clarify the above idea; a 3-way single frequency unequal split\nWPD shown in Figure 4 is designed and simulated. The design\nfrequency is assumed as f = 0.9 GHz, and the system impedance\nZo = 50 Ω. The input power is divided as follows: 50% goes to port 2,\n25% goes to port 3, and 25% goes to port 4.\nThe parameters of branch 1 (Z01 and l1) are found by combining\nports 3 and 4 (branch 2 and branch 3). The equivalent 2-way model\nProgress In Electromagnetics Research C, Vol. 14, 2010 119\nis shown in Figure 5. This 2-way model is equal split, i.e.,k2 = 1,\n(P% branch 2 + P% branch 3 = 50%). Using the analysis described in\nSection 2, branch 1 parameters are as follows:Z01 = Z0\n√\nk(1 +k2) =\n70.71 Ω, l1 = λ/4, and R1 = kZ0 = 50 Ω. Port 2 impedance is 50 Ω\ntoo.\n0Z\n101 , lZ\n202 , lZ\n303 , lZ\n1R\n2R\n3R\nPort 2\nPort 3\nPort 4\nFigure 4. 3-way single-frequency unequal split WPD.\n0Z\n101, lZ\n1R\nPort 2\nCombined ports\n3 and 4\nFigure 5.

Since ports 3 and 4 have the\nsame power ratio, the same results are achieved by combining ports 2\nand 3 to ﬁnd the parameters of branch 3 (Z03 and l3). In this case, the\nequivalent 2-way model is shown in Figure 6. The power split ratio in\nthis divider isk2 = 3, since the combined ports take 75% of the input\npower.\nThus, the parameters of branches 2 and 3 are given as follows:\nZ02 = Z03 = Z0\n√\nk(1 +k2) = 131.61 Ω,R2 = R3 = Z0k = 86.60 Ω,\nRL2 = RL3 = Z0k = 86.60 Ω andl2 = l3 = λ/4, where RL2 and\nRL3 represent ports 3 and 4 impedances, respectively. Using the\nabove parameters, a microstrip 3-way WPD is designed and simulated\nusing Ansoft Designer [2]. FR-4 substrate withεr = 4.4 and height\nh = 1.5 mm is used.\nFigure 7.3-way single-frequency\nWPD matchingS-parameters.\nFigure 8.3-way single-frequency\nWPD isolationS-parameters.\nFigure 9. 3-way single-frequency WPD transmissionS-parameters.\nProgress In Electromagnetics Research C, Vol. 14, 2010 121\nFigures 7, 8, and 9 show the simulated results of the designed 3-\nway single frequency WPD. It is observed that very good matching at\nall ports and very good isolation between the output ports are obtained\nat the design frequencyf = 0.9 GHz. The power dividing ratios of this\nWPD are ideally equal to 3 dB for port 2, and 6 dB for ports 3 and 4.\nSlight deviation is observed in Figure 9 due to conductor and dielectric\nlosses considered in the simulation.\n4. DESIGN OF N-WAY UNEQUAL SPLIT\nMULTI-FREQUENCY WPD\nAs stated earlier, to achieve multi-frequency operation, the quarter-\nwave branches of the conventional N-way Wilkinson power divider are\nreplaced by transmission line transformers (TLTs) consisting of two\nsections (in the case of dual-frequency divider) [21], three sections (in\nthe case of triple-frequency divider) [22], or four sections (in the case\nof quad-frequency divider) [23]. This gives very good input/output\nports matching at the design frequencies. Isolation resistors are placed\nat each end of the transmission line transformers to achieve good\nisolation performance between the output ports.

(b) Odd-mode\nexcitation. (c) Even-mode excitation.\n122 Qaroot and Dib\nthe general schematic of the proposed N-way multi-frequency (M-\nfrequency) unequal split WPD. The main steps in the design procedure\nof N-way dual-frequency, tri-frequency, and quad-frequency WPDs are\nbrieﬂy described below.\n4.1. Dual-Frequency Design\nIn the dual-frequency unequal split N-way WPD,M = 2 is used in\nFigure 10(a). Using the combining technique (Section 3) and even-\nodd mode analysis (Section 2), the branches parameters (Zn1, ln1,\nZn2, ln2), and isolation resistors (Rn1, Rn2) can be found, where\nn = 1, 2, 3, . . . , N. To get the parameters of the nth branch, a 2-\nway model is ﬁrst developed. One of the branches of this 2-way model\nis the nth branch itself, while the other one is the combinedN − 1\nbranches. The split ratio of this equivalent 2-way model is obtained as\ndescribed before.\nIn the even mode excitation of the equivalent 2-way model, the\nbranches can be thought of as two dual-frequency TLTs for which\nclosed form design equations were derived in [21]. The characteristic\nimpedances and line lengths for the two sections of branch “n” (shown\nin Figure 10(c) with M = 2) can be directly calculated using the\nequations presented in [21, 24]. In the odd mode excitation, the 2-\nway equivalent model is reduced to the circuit shown in Figure 10(b).\nBy imposing the matching condition at the output ports, the resistors\nvalues can be obtained using the closed form design equations presented\nin [12, 24]. It should be mentioned that to ensure that the values of\nthese resistors are real and positive, a condition on the ratio between\nthe two design frequencies (f2/f1) was derived in [4]. The same\ncondition applies here too.\n4.2. TRI-Frequency Design\nThe tri-frequency ( M = 3) unequal split WPD is obtained by\nusing three sections of transmission line transformers in the WPD of\nFigure 10(a). Similar to the dual-frequency WPD, the tri-frequency\ndivider can be designed and analyzed using the above techniques. In\nthe even mode excitation of the equivalent 2-way model, the branches\ncan be thought of as two tri-frequency TLTs for which closed form\ndesign equations were derived in [22]. The characteristic impedances\nand line lengths for the three sections of branch “ n” (shown in\nFigure 10(c) withM = 3) can be directly calculated using equations\npresented in [22, 24]. In the odd mode excitation, the 2-way equivalent\nmodel is reduced to the circuit shown in Figure 10(b). By imposing\nthe matching condition at the output ports at the three design\nProgress In Electromagnetics Research C, Vol. 14, 2010 123\nfrequencies, the isolation resistors can be found using an optimization\ntechnique [22, 24]. Here, the Particle Swarm Optimization method [25]\nis used to ﬁnd the values of the resistors.\n4.3. Quad-Frequency Design\nQuad-frequency unequal split WPD is obtained when M = 4 in\nFigure 10. Four isolation resistors are used in each branch to enhance\nthe isolation between the output ports. Four sections of transmission\nline transformer are used to match the output ports at 4 arbitrary\nfrequencies. In the even mode excitation of the equivalent 2-way model,\nthe branches can be thought of as two quad-frequency TLTs for which\nclosed form design equations were derived in [23]. The characteristic\nimpedances and line lengths for the four sections of branch “n” (shown\nin Figure 10(c) withM = 4) can be directly calculated using equations\npresented in [23, 24]. In the odd mode excitation, the 2-way equivalent\nmodel is reduced to the circuit shown in Figure 10(b). By imposing the\nmatching condition at the output ports at the four design frequencies,\nthe isolation resistors can be found using the PSO technique [24].\n5. NUMERICAL EXAMPLES\nIn this section, a 3-way dual-frequency unequal split WPD, a 3-way\ntri-frequency unequal split WPD, and a 4-way quad-frequency equal\nsplit WPD are designed and simulated to verify the proposed analysis.\nThe simulations were carried using Ansoft Designer software [20]. The\nsimulation is based on microstrip lines on FR-4 substrate including loss\neﬀects. The reference impedanceZ0 is chosen to be 50 Ω.\n5.1. Example 1: 3-Way Dual-Frequency Unequal Split WPD\nPower division is assumed as follows: 50% to port 2, and 25% to\neach of ports 3 and 4. The design frequencies are f1 = 0.9 GHz,\nand f2 = 1.8 GHz. The parameters of the WPD calculated using\nthe above dual-frequency analysis are as follows: Z11 = 79.29 Ω,\nZ12 = 63.06 Ω,Z21 = 151.04 Ω,Z22 = 114.68 Ω,Z31 = 151.04 Ω,\nZ32 = 114.68 Ω, ln1 = ln2 = λ/6 at f1 = 0.9 GHz (n = 1, 2, 3)\nR11 = 55 Ω,R12 = 101.5 Ω,R21 = 151 Ω,R22 = 170.5 Ω,R31 = 151 Ω,\nR32 = 170.5 Ω. Moreover, the impedances of the output ports are\nas follows: RL2 = 50 Ω,RL3 = 86.60 Ω, andRL4 = 86.60 Ω. The\nsimulation results of the S-parameters are presented in Figures 11,\n12, and 13. Figure 11 shows that very good matching is obtained\nat all ports at the design frequencies. The isolation parametersS23\n124 Qaroot and Dib\nFigure 11.3-way dual-frequency\nWPD matchingS-parameters.\nFigure 12.3-way dual-frequency\nWPD isolationS-parameters.\nFigure 13. 3-way dual-frequency WPD transmissionS-parameters.\nand S24 show the same performance (better than−45 dB), because\nthe power split ratio between these ports are the same, while the\nisolation parameter S43 is around −40 dB at the center frequencies.\nInsertion lossesS31 and S41 are around the ideal value of−6 dB at the\ncenter frequencies with deviation of−0.1 dB for the ﬁrst frequency and\n−0.27 dB for the second frequency. The insertion lossS21 is around\nthe ideal value of−3 dB, since 50% of the input power goes to port\n(2). Deviations of−0.35 dB atf1 and −0.54 dB atf2 are encountered\ndue to losses.\n5.2. Example 2: 3-Way Tri-Frequency Unequal Split WPD\nPower division is assumed as follows: 35% for each of ports 2 and\n3 and 30% to port 4. The operating frequencies are f1 = 1 GHz,\nf2 = 2 GHz, andf3 = 3 GHz. The parameters of this WPD calculated\nProgress In Electromagnetics Research C, Vol. 14, 2010 125\nusing the above tri-frequency analysis are as follows: for the ﬁrst two\nbranches (n = 1, 2): Zn1 = 118.64 Ω,Zn2 = 98.74 Ω,Zn3 = 82.18 Ω,\nln1 = ln2 = ln3 = λ/8 at f1 = 1 GHz,RLn = 68.19 Ω,Rn1 = 80.14 Ω,\nRn2 = 147.34 Ω,Rn3 = 208.41 Ω. Moreover, for the third branch:\nZ31 = 136.75 Ω,Z32 = 112.92 Ω,Z33 = 93.25 Ω,RL3 = 76.32 Ω,R31 =\n92.4 Ω,R32 = 164.92 Ω,R33 = 228.29 Ω, andl31 = l32 = l33 = λ/8 at\nf1 = 1 GHz. The simulation results of theS-parameters are presented\nin Figures 14, 15, and 16. From Figure 14, it can be seen that very\ngood matching is obtained at all ports at the four design frequencies.\nInsertion lossesS21 and S31 are around the ideal value of−4.55 dB with\ndeviations of−0.25 dB atf1, −0.45 dB atf2, and−0.65 dB atf3. The\ninsertion lossS41 is around the ideal value of−5.23 dB with deviations\nof −0.17 dB atf1, −0.36 dB atf2, and −0.56 dB atf3. Isolation\nparameters S23, S24, and S34 are very similar and show performance\nbetter than−40 dB at the design frequenciesf1, f2, andf3.\nFigure 14. 3-way tri-frequency WPD matchingS-parameters.\nFigure 15. 3-way tri-frequency\nWPD transmissionS-parameters.\nFigure 16. 3-way tri-frequency\nWPD isolationS-parameters.\n126 Qaroot and Dib\n5.3. Example 3: 4-Way Quad-Frequency Equal Split WPD\nIn this example, the input power is assumed to be equally divided\nbetween the output ports i.e., 25% goes to each output port. The\noperating frequencies are chosen asf1 = 1 GHz,f2 = 2 GHz,f3 =\n3 GHz, andf4 = 4 GHz. The parameters of the WPD are calculated\nusing the above quad-frequency analysis giving: Zn1 = 168.77 Ω,\nZn2 = 142.92 Ω, Zn3 = 121.18 Ω, Zn4 = 102.62 Ω, ln1 = ln2 =\nln3 = ln4 = λ/10 at f1 = 1 GHz,RLn = 86.60 Ω,Rn1 = 110.99 Ω,\nRn2 = 202.64 Ω,Rn3 = 277.13 Ω, andRn4 = 342.64 Ω (for all branches,\ni.e., n = 1, 2, 3, 4). The simulation results of the S-parameters are\npresented in Figures 17 and 18. Insertion lossesS21, S31, S41, and\nS51 are around the ideal value of−6 dB with deviations of−0.4 dB\nat f1, −0.5 dB atf2, −0.71 dB atf3, and −0.92 dB atf4. Isolation\nparameters S23, S24, S25, S34, S45, and S35 are all the same and less\nthan −40 dB at the design frequencies. Figure 18 shows that very good\nmatching is obtained at all ports. In fact, this WPD can be used in a\nwide band that extends from 0.5–5 GHz.\nFigure 17. 4-way quad-\nfrequency WPD isolation and\ntransmission S-paramete\nFigure 18. 4-way quad-\nfrequency WPD matching\nS-parameters.\n6. CONCLUSIONS AND FINAL REMARKS\nThis paper has presented the analysis and design of a general N-\nway multi-frequency equal/unequal split Wilkinson power divider\nwithout any signiﬁcant modiﬁcation to the original Wilkinson structure\n(without transmission line stubs or reactive components), which\nsimpliﬁes the mathematical analysis of the WPD. The proposed\nstructure and the analytical design method are veriﬁed through several\nProgress In Electromagnetics Research C, Vol. 14, 2010 127\nsimulated power dividers with diﬀerent design frequencies and diﬀerent\npower split ratios. The simulated results of the designed Wilkinson\npowers dividers showed the validity of the proposed design procedure\nand proved the multi-frequency nature of the proposed WPD.\nUnfortunately, we can not fabricate and measure such devices due\nto the lack of needed equipment. However, a dual-frequency equal split\n3-way WPD, having a structure similar to the one proposed here, was\nfabricated and measured in [4]. The experimental results were very\nclose to the theoretical ones, which makes us believe that our proposed\nunequal split WPDs are practically realizable. Indeed, one drawback\nof our proposed WPD is the fact that they are not planar. Having\nto connect the isolation resistors at a common node could make the\nimplementation of these WPDs with largeN somewhat diﬃcult. At\nthe present time, we are working on developing a similar theory to\ndesign planar N-way unequal split WPDs.\nREFERENCES\n1. Taub, J. J. and B.
