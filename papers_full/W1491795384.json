  "abstract": "The influence of arrangement, dimensions, and magnetic permeability of the magnetic flux shunts on the flux distribution and leakage reactance of the power transformers is studied in this paper by using a finite elements method and a simple modeling approach. By using magneto-static analysis and finite element method, first the flux distribution in the 2D model of a core-type three phase power transformer and then using the magnetic stored energy method the leakage reactance of the transformer windings is calculated. By studying the different models including magnetic flux shunts, the effect of the arrangement, geometric dimensions as well as the magnetic permeability of the magnetic flux shunt on the leakage reactance of the transformer are studied and some interesting results are obtained. It is shown that the variation of these parameters in the transformer model has significant effects on the leakage reactance of the transformer.",
