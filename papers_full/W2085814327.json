Such comparisons can help to\nidentify novel or rapidly evolving sequences, horizontal\nsequence transfer events, and interesting functional dif-\nferences or relationships. Tools that can be used to\nvisualize sequence conservation in conjunction with\nother sequence characteristics, such as functional classi-\nfications and nucleotide composition, are particularly\npopular [1-3]. Continual advances in sequencing tech-\nnology have contributed to the availability of numerous\nbacterial genome sequences— currently there are thou-\nsands of bacterial and archaeal genome sequences avail-\nable, and undoubtedly many more on the way. Given the\naccessibility of genome sequences there is an increasing\nneed for comparative genomics tools that can handle\n* Correspondence: stothard@ualberta.ca\nDepartment of Agricultural, Food and Nutritional Science, University of\nAlberta, Edmonton, AB T6G2P5, Canada\n© 2012 Grant et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

The CGView Comparison\nTool (CCT) is a software package designed for visually\ncomparing bacterial, plasmid, chloroplast, or mitochon-\ndrial genomes to thousands of other genomes or se-\nquence collections. CCT can also display sequence\nfeature information, COG classifications (which it deter-\nmines itself), sequence analysis results, and base com-\nposition plots. Maps are highly customizable, both in\nterms of how comparisons are conducted and how\nresults are presented, and can be generated in several\nsizes and file formats, suitable for publications, presenta-\ntions, and posters.\nImplementation\nCCT consists of several custom Bash and Perl scripts\nthat are used to create a local COG sequence database\n[4], download sequences of interest from NCBI [5],\nextract and translate ORFs, extract CDS feature transla-\ntions, perform BLAST searches [6], assign COG func-\ntional categories to proteins, generate CGView XML\nfiles [7] and create graphical maps. Additional scripts are\nincluded for redrawing maps and for drawing zoomed\nmaps showing regions of interest in more detail. Wrap-\nper scripts simplify the use of CCT by allowing a single\ncommand to run many of the CCT components in\nsuccession. The usage of these scripts is described in\nthe “commands” section of the CCT documentation\nand demonstrated in the CCT tutorials. Although a\ncommand-line interface can be intimidating, the avail-\nability of a Linux virtual machine and clear documenta-\ntion and tutorials should help users with little\ncommand-line experience take advantage of CCT. Fur-\nthermore, a few simple commands can be used to create\nseveral complex maps, thanks to the included wrapper\nscripts. Command-line tools are widespread and popular\nin bioinformatics, and offer important advantages related\nto reproducibility, automation, and remote execution.\nResults\nCreating maps using CCT\nCCT maps typically consist of several rings depicting a\nreference genome and its features (coding sequences and\nORFs for example), and the results of BLAST compari-\nsons between the reference sequence and one or more\ncomparison sequences. A separate BLAST ring is drawn\nfor each comparison genome. When there is similarity\nbetween a portion of the reference sequence and any\npart of a comparison sequence, a coloured arc is drawn\nbeneath the region of the reference sequence showing\nsimilarity, in the appropriate comparison ring. User\ndefined features, analysis results, and base composition\nplots may also be displayed.\nThere are three main approaches to drawing maps\nusing CCT. One is to run thecgview_comparison_tool.pl\nscript, supplying it with the name of a new map project\n(Additional file 1A). The script creates a directory tree\nnamed after the project, consisting of a few directories\nand a configuration file (Additional file 1B). The user\nthen places the sequence to be drawn and the compari-\nson sequences into the reference_genome and compari-\nson_genomes directories, respectively. Several sequence\nformats are supported, including GenBank, EMBL, and\nFASTA. Protein or DNA sequence collections in FASTA\nformat (sequence reads for example) can also be placed\nin the comparison_genomes directory. Additional fea-\ntures or analysis results (gene expression measurements\nfor example) can be placed in the appropriate directories\nat this time. The configuration file, which is a simple\ntext file consisting of options and values as well as expla-\nnations of the options can be edited to specify, for\nexample, the types of BLAST comparisons to be per-\nformed, the base composition plots to display, and the\nsize of the map to be generated. When thecgview_com-\nparison_tool.pl script is rerun on the same project, it\ndetects the sequence files and initiates the map creation\nprocess. All intermediate and output files, including the\nBLAST results, COG assignments, CGView XML files,\nand graphical maps, are written to directories located in-\nside the project directory. A sample map generated using\nthis script is given in Figure 1. Once the map has been com-\npleted the create_zoomed_maps.sh and redraw_maps.sh\nscripts can be used to draw additional maps showing\nregions of interest in more detail (Figure 2), or to\nmake changes to the appearance of the map. Both\nscripts make use of the existing BLAST results in the\nproject directory so that the BLAST searches are not\nrepeated.\nThe second and even simpler approach to using CCT\nis to run the build_blast_atlas.sh script (Additional file\n2), which accepts a GenBank file as input and creates\nseveral graphical maps comparing the input sequence to\nall sequences placed in the comparison_genomes direc-\ntory. The advantage of using this wrapper script is that it\nautomatically creates two map projects, one comparing\nthe sequences at the DNA level using blastn searches,\nand one comparing the CDS feature translations using\nblastp. The two map types are useful for different pur-\nposes: conserved non-transcribed or non-translated\nsequences can be identified using the blastn map, while\nsimilar protein coding regions are best visualized using\nthe blastp map. The CDS maps also display COG func-\ntional categories, which are assigned automatically by\nCCT (Figure 3). Both map types also use a modified\ncolour scheme for BLAST hits (hits are coloured based\non sequence identity as opposed to source genome). For\neach map type three images are generated showing\ndiffering levels of detail. The largest map includes fea-\nture labels for the reference genome. Expanded maps\nGrant et al. BMC Genomics2012, 13:202 Page 2 of 8\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/13/202\nshowing more detail can be created using the create_-\nzoomed_maps.sh script. Examples of larger maps com-\nparing thousands of genomes are available on the CCT\nweb site.\nThe third approach to using CCT is to run thebuild_-\nblast_atlas_all_vs_all.shscript. This script creates a separ-\nate map for every sequence in the comparison_genomes\ndirectory, depicting the results of BLAST comparisons with\nall the other sequences in the directory. The individual\nmaps are then combined into a single montage map\n(Figure 4). The montage allows more thorough compari-\nsons to be conducted among a group of closely related\ngenomes, by allowing every sequence to serve as the refer-\nence sequence. For example, sequences missing from a\nreference genome relative to the comparison genomes will\nnot be observed using a single map but can be detected\nusing this approach. The separate (and larger) map images\ncombined to create the montage are also available in the\noutput directory.\nAn important and potentially time-consuming step\nwhen creating maps, regardless of the mapping software\nused, is obtaining the reference and comparison genome\nsequence records to be visualized. To simplify this\nprocess CCT includes several scripts for downloading\nsequences of interest directly from NCBI. These scripts\nmake use of the NCBI Entrez Utilities Web Service API\nand can be used to download a single record based on\naccession number (fetch_genome_by_accession.sh), all the\nrecords corresponding to a particular species or genus\n(fetch_refseq_bacterial_genomes_by_name.sh), or all the\nrecords from a particular organelle or domain (e.g.\nfetch_all_refseq_mitochondrial_genomes.sh). Options are\nFigure 1CCT map comparing anE. colireference sequence to other E. coli genomes.This map was generated by commands 1 to 5 given\nin Additional file 1A. Starting from the outermost ring the feature rings depict: 1. COG functional categories for forward strand coding sequences;\n2. Forward strand sequence features; 3. Reverse strand sequence features; 4. COG functional categories for reverse strand coding sequences. The\nnext 30 rings show regions of sequence similarity detected by BLAST comparisons conducted between CDS translations from the reference\ngenome and 30E. coli comparison genomes. The last two rings display the GC content and GC skew.\nGrant et al. BMC Genomics2012, 13:202 Page 3 of 8\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/13/202\nincluded for further restricting sequence retrieval\naccording to sequence length. These options allow, for\nexample, plasmid sequences to be avoided when down-\nloading bacterial chromosomes. As with the other CCT\nscripts, the use of these utilities is demonstrated in the\ntutorials and all script options are described in the\n“commands” section of the CCT documentation.\nCCT visualization enhancements\nSeveral subtle but important enhancements have been\nmade to CCT during its development to increase its util-\nity as a genome visualization tool. For example, features\nparsed from reference sequence file are drawn with par-\ntial opacity by default, so that the boundaries of features\nare apparent even if they overlap. When CCT assigns\nFigure 2Zoomed CCT map showing enhanced detail.This 15X zoomed map was produced by command 6 given in Additional file 1A.\nStarting from the uppermost slot the feature slots depict: 1. COG functional categories for forward strand coding sequences; 2. Forward strand\nsequence features; 3. Reverse strand sequence features; 4. COG functional categories for reverse strand coding sequences. The next 30 slots show\nregions of sequence similarity detected by BLAST comparisons conducted between CDS translations from the reference genome and 30E. coli\ncomparison genomes. The last two slots show the GC content and GC skew.\nGrant et al. BMC Genomics2012, 13:202 Page 4 of 8\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/13/202\nCOG functional categories, it is able to appropriately\nhandle cases where a protein appears to fall into mul-\ntiple categories (based on sequence comparisons). In\nsuch situations the coloured arrow used to indicate\nCOG class is divided into the appropriate number of\nsmaller arrows, each coloured to represent a single COG\ncategory. This behaviour differs from that used to create\nvirtually all existing bacterial maps that colour proteins\naccording to functional class. When BLAST atlases\nare built by CCT (using the build_blast_atlas.sh or\nbuild_blast_atlas_all_vs_all.sh scripts), the reference\ngenome is included automatically as one of the com-\nparison genomes. The inclusion of the reference leads\nto a seemingly superfluous reference vs. reference\nBLAST analysis that actually serves an important pur-\npose— it reveals portions of the reference that are un-\nable to produce BLAST hits, due to ambiguous bases,\nBLAST filtering, or an absence of protein-coding\nsequences (in the case of protein or translated BLAST\nsearches). Without the reference vs. reference ring there\nis the potential for comparison rings to be interpreted\nincorrectly. Unlike the other BLAST atlas tools we have\nencountered, CCT adjusts the order of the comparison\ngenome rings automatically (when thebuild_blast_atlas.\nsh or build_blast_atlas_all_vs_all.sh scripts are used), so\nthat the most similar genomes tend to be placed closest\nto the reference sequence ring. Similarity is determined\nusing a heuristic that considers the total number of\ncomparison genome bases contributing to hits as well\nas the scores of the hits. In practice this sorting makes\nit much easier to visualize sequence divergence trends\nfor the genes or proteins in a reference sequence. For\nexample, the most labile or divergent portions of a\nreference genome standout as light-coloured regions\nFigure 3CCT map comparing the rat mitochondrial genome to itself and 99 other mitochondrial genomes.This map was generated by\ncommands given in Additional file 2A. Starting from the outermost ring the feature rings depict: 1. COG functional categories for forward strand\ncoding sequences; 2. Forward strand sequence features; 3. Reverse strand sequence features; 4. COG functional categories for reverse strand\ncoding sequences (the ring is empty because no COG categories were assigned). The remaining rings show regions of sequence similarity\ndetected by BLAST comparisons conducted between CDS translations from the reference genome and 100 comparison genomes.\nGrant et al. BMC Genomics2012, 13:202 Page 5 of 8\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/13/202\nadjacent to the reference ring, while well-conserved por-\ntions of the reference give rise to darkly-coloured arcs\nthat form “spikes” of conservation extending towards\nthe centre of the map. This sorting can also reveal gen-\nome segments whose similarity is inconsistent with the\ngeneral trends revealed by the map. For example, a\nhorizontally transferred segment can appear as a dark\nred or black arc in a portion of the map consisting of\notherwise weakly similar genomes. Multiple regions of a\ncomparison genome can be similar to a given region of\nthe reference genome. For this reason CCT arranges the\narcs within each BLAST ring so that low-similarity arcs\ndo not obscure higher-similarity arcs. Finally, CCT has\nthe ability to divide protein-search BLAST rings into six\nsub-rings corresponding to the six different reading\nframes of the reference sequence. This feature, when\nFigure 4Montage of CCT maps comparing nineRickettsia genomes. A montage of maps comparingRickettsia genomes at the protein level,\ncreated using thebuild_blast_atlas_all_vs_all.sh script. The montage is comprised of nine separate CCT maps, each depicting one of the genomes\nas the reference and the remaining eight as the comparison genomes. Starting from the outermost ring the four features rings depict: 1. COG\nfunctional categories for forward strand coding sequences; 2. Forward strand sequence features; 3. Reverse strand sequence features; 4. COG\nfunctional categories for reverse strand coding sequences. The remaining rings show regions of similarity detected using BLAST (blastp).\nGrant et al. BMC Genomics2012, 13:202 Page 6 of 8\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/13/202\nused with zoomed maps and CCT’s ORF drawing op-\ntion, can be used to distinguish which of the ORFs or\nCDS features in an overlapping set are conserved.\nBLAST comparison options\nCCT writes a configuration file to each project when it\nis initialized. This simple file can be edited to specify,\namong other things, which types of BLAST comparisons\nare performed. In total there are currently 16 compari-\nson scenarios available. These are described in detail in\nthe CCT documentation, and differ primarily in terms of\nwhich regions of the sequences are compared and\nwhether the comparisons are done at the DNA or pro-\ntein level. For example, CCT can compare the entire\nreference sequence to each comparison genome at the\nnucleotide level using blastn, or it can conduct the com-\nparisons using the 6-frame translations of the sequences,\nusing tblastx. Alternatively, CCT can identify and trans-\nlate ORFs in each sequence, and compare the transla-\ntions using blastp. Instead of determining ORFs, CCT\ncan simply extract the CDS feature translations from the\ninput files and compare them using blastp. Finally, in-\nstead of single genomes the comparison sequence files\ncan consist of multiple DNA sequences in FASTA for-\nmat (next-generation sequencing reads for example) or\nmultiple protein sequences in FASTA format (a custom\ncollection of bacteriophage proteins for example). There\nare options specific to such multi-FASTA files for con-\ntrolling how the comparisons with the reference are per-\nformed. CCT uses file extensions to determine which\nsequence files should be used for a given BLAST com-\nparison. When there are multiple files with the same\nextension, a separate BLAST comparison is conducted\nfor each, and the results are shown in separate rings on\nthe resulting map. Multiple comparison types can be\nshown on a single map. In this manner conserved non-\ntranslated sequences can be visualized along with con-\nserved coding regions.\nAdding custom features and analysis results to CCT maps\nThere are numerous data types users may wish to\nvisualize on CCT maps, such as gene expression mea-\nsurements, the positions of horizontally transferred seg-\nments revealed by specialized programs, the positions of\nSNPs identified by sequencing, and so on. To accommo-\ndate user-supplied information, all CCT projects include\na “features” and an “analysis” directory. Simple tab-\ndelimited or comma-delimited text files can be added to\nthese directories. Files describing the positions of genes\nand other regions of interest are generally placed in the\nfeatures directory, whereas files assigning numerical\nscores (positive or negative) to genome regions are\nplaced in the analysis directory. CCT parses the files and\ncreates a separate ring for each on the final map. The\nregions obtained from the features directory are drawn\nmuch like the features extracted from GenBank files,\nwhereas those parsed from analysis files are scaled\naccording to the accompanying score value.\nAdjusting the appearance of CCT maps\nThe maps generated by CCT are designed to be visually\nappealing and informative. Nonetheless the default\ncolours, font sizes, line widths, etc. may not always be\nappropriate. CCT includes functionality that allows\nmaps to be customized without the need to repeat the\ncomputationally intensive analysis steps used to assign\nCOG categories and identify sequence similarities.\nThis functionality is implemented using more than 70\n\"customization keys\", which can be passed to certain\nCCT commands along with their desired values. For\nexample, the \"backgroundColor = rgb(0,0,0)\" key-value\npair can be supplied to thebuild_blast_atlas.sh script, to\nspecify that maps should be drawn with a black back-\nground. The script can reuse existing BLAST results if\nthey are available in the relevant project directories\n(using the –start_at_xml option). A comprehensive list\nof the CCT customization keys is available on the CCT\nweb site, and commands that make use of these keys are\nincluded in the CCT tutorials.\nThe CCT map creation process generates an XML file\nfor input to the CGView program [7]. This intermediate\nXML file, which uses a simple syntax to fully describe\nthe features and appearance of the map, can be edited as\nanother way of adjusting CCT maps. Theredraw_maps.\nsh script can be used to quickly redraw maps directly\nfrom the modified XML file.\nA final option for customization is to edit the resulting\nimages themselves. CCT maps are drawn in PNG format\nby default but can instead be saved in a vector-based for-\nmat (SVG). Use of SVG format allows map elements to\nbe individually adjusted using a vector graphics editor.\nDiscussion\nThere are many visual comparative genomics tools avail-\nable, each with different advantages and disadvantages.\nFor bacterial genomes, we previously created the\nCGView Server [8], which can compare a reference gen-\nome to up to three comparison genomes, using nucleo-\ntide or translated nucleotide BLAST searches. CCT\ngreatly exceeds the capabilities of this server in all\nregards. For example, far more genomes can be com-\npared, comparisons can be conducted at the level of\nCDS features or ORFs, much larger maps can be drawn,\nmaps can be saved in vector or raster-based formats,\nCOG functional categories can be assigned and shown,\nmap appearance (colours, font sizes, feature widths etc.)\ncan be customized extensively, comparison genome sets\ncan be prepared much more easily, subsets of genes can\nGrant et al. BMC Genomics2012, 13:202 Page 7 of 8\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/13/202\nbe labeled, and multiple maps can be generated auto-\nmatically for a set of sequences. Users also have access\nto the raw BLAST results, CGView XML files, and pro-\ngram source code. Depending on the reasons for per-\nforming the sequence comparison, other tools may\nbe preferred. For example, ACT [1] and Circos [9] use\nlines to connect regions of sequence similarity between\nsequence ideograms, and can thus be used to visualize\nsequence rearrangements. Some users may prefer the\ndefault colour scheme and appearance of maps produced\nusing the BLASTAtlas service [3], over those generated\nby CCT. The MultiPipmaker server can compare larger\ngenomes and create linear figures [2]. The BLAST Ring\nImage Generator (BRIG) [10] uses CGView [7] to render\nmaps and is operated using a graphical user interface.\nThe graphical interface and included functionality for\ndraft genomes and next-generation sequencing data files\nmake BRIG an excellent alternative to CCT for some\nusers and data sets. It is worth noting however that CCT\nhas advantages over all of these tools related to its visual\nenhancements, diversity of included analyses, the num-\nber of genomes it can handle, its integrated scripts for\ndownloading genomes, support for map customization,\nand its command-line interface for rapid creation of\ncomplex maps and pipeline integration.\nConclusion\nIn summary, the CGView Comparison Tool (CCT) is a\npackage for visually comparing circular sequences of inter-\nest to existing genomes or sequence collections. The cap-\nacity and capabilities of CCT distinguish it from existing\nsequence visualization tools. The ease with which large and\ncomplex maps can be created should make CCT appealing\nto anyone who aims to learn more about bacterial, plasmid,\nchloroplast, or mitochondrial genome sequences.\nAvailability and requirements\nProject name: CGView Comparison Tool\nProject home Page:http://stothard.afns.ualberta.ca/\ndownloads/CCT/\nOperating system(s): Unix/Linux\nProgramming language: Perl\nLicense: GNU GPL\nAny restrictions to use by non-academics:none\nAdditional files\nAdditional file 1:Example CCT workflow using the\ncgview_comparison_tool.pl script.
