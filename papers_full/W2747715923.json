Moreover, the quick improvement of protective technology\nhas covered the way for the application of accurate and reliable methods\nin protective schemes. Presently, current differential relaying scheme is a\nproper protection for the single and multi-circuit protective means. However,\nthis protection scheme faces difﬁculty in several situations. CT saturation\nattributable to an external fault may cause undesired trip of differential\nprotection. In fact, this happen due to inequality in the burden of CTs or\nnon-matching magnetizing features or remnant ﬂux in one of the CTs at\nboth ends.\nIn recent years, many researcher works have been dedicated to the problem\nof CT saturation detection and compensation but somehow all methods have\nits own limitations and until today proper methodology are not accepted in\nreal ﬁeld. Some papers have presented methods based on derivation of CT\nsecondary current [1–6]. Ali Hooshyaret al.[1] presented nicely CT saturation\ndetection based on wave shape properties of current difference functions,\neven they uses wave shape properties of current derivatives methodology on\nmathematical solution with all kind of possible situation like power factor,\nburden, fault inception angle etc. The accurate operation of this method is\nunaffected by the saturation severity level, noise, harmonics, and other tran-\nsients even but practical implementation is remain left. Again Hooshyaret al.\n[2] developed a new derivative-based algorithm to detect current transformer\nsaturation although detection time is large up to 200 ms, it’s so high. Chothani\nand Bhalja [3] suggested algorithm for current transformer saturation detection\nand compensation based on derivatives of secondary currents and Newton’s\nbackward difference formulae. This method is presented on mathematical base\nand validated but comparison with different method is remain left. Y . C. Kang\net al.[4] explained design and evaluation of an algorithm for detecting current\ntransformer saturation with a ﬁrst order low-pass RC anti-aliasing ﬁlter. Sang-\nHee Kang et al. [5] presented a CT saturation detection algorithm based on\nwavelet transformation and a second order Butterworth high pass ﬁlter is used\nto extract the ﬁne peak feature from the output signal of the ﬁlter banks.\nFiltering process of the DWT is just same methodology. D. Baket al. [6]\nSupport V ector Machine based Classiﬁcation of Current Transformer27\nexplained new method of detection of current transformer saturation using\nEMTPsoftware analysis using ﬁrst order derivatives of signals only. Moreover,\nthere are papers which have proposed techniques based on decaying DC\noffset [7–9]. Ali Hooshyar and Majid Sanaye [7] elaborate CT saturation\ndetection based on decaying DC offset in fault currents. Ehsan Hajipour\net al. [8] explained CT saturation compensation for transformer differential\nrelays based on Deformed Signal Compensation (DSC) and DC Offset Current\nCompensation (DOCC). T. Y . Jiet al. [9] proposed a morphological scheme\nfor the correction of CT saturation waveforms using the estimation of the\nparameters of the DC offset with Genetic Algorithm (GA). Furthermore,\nLeast Estimation Square (LES) based methods [10, 11] are elaborated for\nCT saturation detection. F. B. Ajaeiet al. [10] explained compensation of\nthe current transformer saturation based on LES ﬁltering technology for\nthe current with Minimum Estimation Error Tracking (MEET) approach\nof the phasor estimation. D. Shiet al. [11] suggested fast compensation of\ncurrent transformer saturation with computational of the estimation based on\nSeparable Non Linear Least Squares (SNLLS) method. Meanwhile, phasor\nquantity based analysis are also carried out [12, 13] for CT saturation analysis.\nEhab M. Esmailet al. [12] presented detection and compensation of current\ntransformers by using Kalman ﬁltering phasor quantities of the unsaturated\ncurrent portion is extracted and basis of these phasor quantities, CT saturation\nis detected. N. Villamagna and P. Crossley [13] explained CT saturation\ndetection using symmetrical components of current, phasor value of sequence\ncomponent is estimated to detect the CT saturation. One another method for\ndetection of CT saturation based on distance between two consecutive points\n[14, 15]. E. M. dos Santoset al.[14] proposed current transformer saturation\ndetection based on the distance between consecutive points in the plans formed\nby the secondary current samples and their difference-functions. Chothani\nand Sharma [15] explained CT saturation detection using secondary current\nenvelope detector using ﬁrst order low pass ﬁlter.\nKrzysztof Solak [16] et al. suggested fuzzy adaptive relaying scheme\nimmune to CT saturation for avoiding maloperation of relaying scheme. How-\never real hardware based implementation is complicated issue. Ali Hooshyar\nand M. Sanaye-Pasand [17, 18] elaborated wave shape recognition technique\nand variable-length window to detect current transformer saturation which is\njust same as [1] to analyze the current waveform, a new window designated\nas the Symmetry Assessment Window (SAW) is deﬁned through hardware\nanalysis but still improvement is required. J. G . Kappenmanet al. [19]\nelaborated CT saturation based on Geomagnetically-Induced Currents (GIC)\n28 N. G . Chothani et al.\nwhich is also utilizing as an effective scheme. On the other hand, effectiveness\nis a main constrain in various types of saturation effect. Bruno M. Schettino\net al. [20] presented current-transformer saturation detection based on level\nof the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and compared with the 3rd difference\nfunction method. However, the feasibility of the entire scheme for CT satu-\nration mentioned above is not tested by considering variation in system and\nfault parameters.\nIn this paper, a new method for identiﬁcation of saturated condition of\ncurrent transformer using Support Vector Machine (SVM) is proposed by\nthe authors. The proposed scheme provides effective discrimination between\nunsaturated and saturated condition. Feasibility of the proposed algorithm has\nbeen experienced by simulating various test cases using PSCAD/EMTDC\nsoftware package [21]. The performance of the developed algorithm has\nbeen tested over a large data set (4320 simulation cases), generated using\nan automatic data generation model developed by the authors, considering\nwide variation in different system and fault conditions. The results show that\nthe proposed algorithm provides well-organized classiﬁcation for saturation\nof CT under various conditions.\n2 Problem Description\nCurrent transformer is the most important equipment in the power system\nprotection. Saturation of a current transformer is one of the most burning issues\nin all protective schemes. Different conventional and intelligent methods\nare available to solve the problems of CT saturation in current transformer.\nFollowing issues detailed in Section 2.1 to 2.4 are accountable for saturation\nof CT in power system.\n2.1 Core over Sizing Factor\nFor, well-organized design of core cross section of CT corresponds toφ\nmax\nac\nshould be near the knee point of B-H curve. To corresponding ﬂux density\n(B) below the knee-point, one logical way to avoid CT saturation on DC ﬂux\nis to oversize the core so, that ﬂux(φ\nmax\nac + φmax\ndc ) passed through minimum\nremanence. Therefore, core over sizing factor is given by:\nCore over sizing factor = 1 + φmax\ndc\nφmaxac\n=1+ X\nR (1)\nAs per Equation (1), the transmission line X/R ratio for a 220 KV line will be\nin the region of 7 to 10 and for 400 KV line value of X/R is approximately 20.\nSupport V ector Machine based Classiﬁcation of Current Transformer29\nThis would imply an over sizing required of about 21 times the usual design.\nClearly, this high quantity of over sizing is not practical. Thus, power engineers\nhave to overcome the saturation difﬁculty with constrain of CT size.\n2.2 Remnant Flux\nSecondly, the core saturation is a physical phenomenon. It happens when\nthe coupled magnetic ﬂux is so intense. That all magnetic domains on a\nferromagnetic material are already aligned and thus does not respond to\nany further increase in the ﬂux. The implications on the current transformer\nsecondary current may be diverse. Having a saturated core does not mean\nthe current on the CT secondary will be high or even constant as the ﬂux\nincreases. Once saturated, the inductance of the circuit drops dramatically.\nTaking account other phenomena like hysteresis, the resultant waveform on\nthe secondary circuit coupled by a saturated core is highly distorted and full\nof harmonics. Depending on the level of saturation and the capability of the\nmeasuring device to process the distorted waveform (harmonics) the measured\ncurrent on the secondary is much smaller than the corresponding RMS value\npresent in the primary.\n2.3 DC Offset\nBasic principle of electromechanical conversion states that the output on the\nsecondary is related to the variation of the coupled magnetic ﬂux. It explains\nwhy a regular CT and transformers can’t operate on DC. Although the DC\ncurrent is not converted into secondary current, it does generates magnetic ﬂux\nand thus contribute to core saturation. Theoretically a core fully saturated by a\nDC current has no output (DC current causes no variation of coupled magnetic\nﬂux through time). Asymmetrical faults (like phase-phase) may generate DC\ncomponents contributing to CT saturation (That’s where the 20x criteria on\nCT sizing came from Equation (1)). Although, resulting in non-linear output,\nthe saturation of a CT magnetic core has a different characteristic from other\nsaturation phenomena observed on systems like audio ampliﬁers. The bottom\nline is that the current waveform on the secondary of a saturated CT may be\ndiverse depending on what components are present on the primary current\nand also on the burden wired to the secondary circuit of the CT. CT saturation\nleads to protection devices maloperation as the measured current does not\ncorrespond to the actual current on the system.\n30 N. G . Chothani et al.\n2.4 Burden on CT Secondary\nAll other factors being equal, a CT with a higher total secondary burden of\nthe same power factor will have a shorter time-to-saturation. This is because\nthe higher burden demands a higher voltage at a given current and the ﬂux is\nproportional to the voltage. For two impedances of the same magnitude, the\none with the more inductive component (lower pF) will give a longer time-to-\nsaturation because the inductance has low impedance to the DC offset current,\nreducing the burden voltage drop and associated ﬂux. A second characteristic\nof inductive burdens is their tendency to saturate at high secondary currents.\nThe effect is to reduce the burden volt drop, which reduces the ﬂux and\nincreases the time-to-saturation. When an inductive burden is added to a\nCT circuit, the magnitude of the overall ohmic burden is not substantially\nincreased (even if saturation of the burden is ignored) because the impedances\nare added as vectors rather than as scalars.\n3 SVM Based Proposed Method\nThis article presents a saturation of current transformer and its classiﬁcation\nwith various aspects. Various level of CT saturation i.e. low, medium and\nheavy by considering different factors are analyzed for classiﬁcation of\nunsaturated and saturated cases. Authors have suggested SVM based method\nto discriminate saturation of current transformer and compared with ANN\ntechnique.\nFigure 1 shows the schematic block diagram of the proposed scheme.\nInitially, the SVM is conﬁgured using training data set; samples of current\nsignals of all the lines are acquired by data acquisition system. After conﬁgur-\ning the SVM, samples of post fault CT secondary current signals are utilized\nto formulate the feature vectors with the help of testing data set. Soon after,\nthese feature vectors are used as an input to SVM classiﬁer. The output of the\nSVM is used to identify the saturated and unsaturated case.\nSVM is a relatively new computational learning method based on the\nstatistical learning theory. It is used as a very powerful tool to solve the\nclassiﬁcation problems. It tries to ﬁnd out an ‘optimal hyper-plane’ to separate\nthe data points according to their classes such that the separation between the\nclasses is maximum. A fault classiﬁcation task usually involves training and\ntesting of some data instances. Each instance in the training set contains one\n“target value” (class labels) and several “attributes” (features). The goal of\nthe SVM is to produce a model that predicts the target value of data instances\nSupport V ector Machine based Classiﬁcation of Current Transformer31\nFigure 1 Proposed SVM based algorithm to detect CT saturation.\nin the testing set, which are given only the attributes [22]. The output of\nSVM, the value ‘1’ and ‘0’, denotes the saturated and unsaturated current\nsignal respectively. The SVM technique has been implemented in MATLAB\nenvironment using Lib-SVM toolbox [23].\nFor accurate and efﬁcient SVM classiﬁcation, it is essential to implicitly\nmap the input vector into a high dimensional feature space using a non-linear\ntransformation. In practice, this non-linear transformation is accomplished\nindirectly by using the so called kernel functions, which is deﬁned by,\nK(x\ni,xj )=Φ ( xi)T Φ(xj ) (2)\nThe most commonly used kernel functions are as under:\n1. Linear: K(xi,xj )=( xi)T (xj )\n2. Polynomial: K(xi,xj )= {y(xi)T (xj )+ r}d,y > 0\n3. Radial Basis Function (RBF):K(xi,xj ) = exp(−g|xi − xj |2),g > 0\n4. Sigmoid: K(xi,xj ) = tanh{y(xi)T (xj )+ r}\nWhere, y, r and d are kernel parameters.\nReferring to many literatures, it has been observed by the authors that\nRadial Basis Function (RBF) kernel is the ﬁrst choice for training as it\nnonlinearly maps samples into higher dimensional space most effectively\namong all types of kernels used [24].\n32 N.

A 220 kV transmission line (80 km) is originated from 220 kV\nbus and connected to inﬁnite bus, on which 1200/1 Ampere CT is connected\nto acquire the current signal during various abnormal situations. Various\nsaturated and unsaturated cases are simulated using PSCAD/EMTDC software\nand validated using SVM classiﬁer implemented in MATLAB. To validate the\nproposed algorithm, the CT located on transmission line (Figure 2) is analyzed\nwhich uses Jiles – Atherton model available in PSCAD/EMTDC software\npackage [25].\nTable 1 shows different parameter values which have been chosen in this\nwork to generate CT saturation conditions. Table 1 also shows breakup of total\n3600 saturated cases, among them 2000 data are consider as training data and\nremain 1600 data are taken for testing.\nSimilarly, as shown in Table 2, unsaturated CT secondary data are gener-\nated by system and fault parameter variations. Table 2 also shows bifurcation of\ntotal 720 unsaturated data, among them 480 data are considering as training\nand remaining 240 data are consider as testing of the proposed algorithm.\nAuthors have generated these data by simulating Figure 2 in PSCAD/EMTDC\nsoftware.

For this purpose, out of the total\nof 3600+720=4320 cases, 2000+480=2480 fault cases have been chosen\nfor training with different system parameters as given in Tables 1 and 2.\nRemaining cases (1600+240=1840) have been used for testing & validation\n34 N. G . Chothani et al.\nof the proposed technique. The fault classiﬁcation accuracy (η) is given by,\nη = Number of correct fault classification casess\nTotal Number of test cases (1840) × 100% (3)\nOnce the training cases have been identiﬁed among all the simulated cases,\nthe next step is to train SVM with the most optimal parametric settings. To\nachieve this, type of kernel function to be used for SVM with its associated\nparameters must be decided. It has been observed that with the optimized\nkernel parameters i.e. g = 0.0032 and C = 1000, the Gaussian RBF kernel gives\nthe highest accuracy of 99.67%. These regularization parameters are selected\nby trial and error method for which it gives highest classiﬁcation accuracy.\nIn order to test effectiveness of the proposed scheme under varying system\nconditions, a large numbers of simulation cases have been generated. Different\nparameter values which have been chosen to produce the transient response of\nCT are remanence ﬂux density, burden resistance and presence of DC offset &\nnoise. Considering these all parameter values, around 4320 simulations cases\nwere generated and the effectiveness of the proposed scheme was veriﬁed\nfor all these test cases (1840). Figure 3 shows waveform of saturated and\nunsaturated CT secondary current in presence of decaying DC component\nalong with higher value of burden resistance (10Ω). Conversely, Figure 4\nshows same waveforms without DC component and having moderate CT\nsaturation.\nThe amount of remanent ﬂux in the core depends on factors such as\nmagnitude of primary current, the burden on secondary circuit and the\nFigure 3 Waveform of CT secondary current with saturation and without saturation including\nDC component for burden resistance = 10Ω.\nSupport V ector Machine based Classiﬁcation of Current Transformer35\nFigure 4 Waveform of CT secondary current with light saturation and without DC component\nfor burden resistance = 5Ω.\namplitude & time constant of decaying DC component. Depending upon the\ndirection of ﬂux setup in the core during the energization of CT in presence\nof remanent ﬂux, a large part of secondary current of CT may saturate. In\nthis situation, the performance of protective class CT is inﬂuenced by this\nremanence or residual magnetism and may reach up to 90% of the saturation\nﬂux. Figure 5 show the CT secondary currents during fault applied at FIA =\n135 degree with 0.5Ω burden resistance with 50% remanent ﬂux density. This\nremanent ﬂux density was set in the core of CT prior to inception of fault.\nTo evaluate the proposed algorithm, acquired current signals from\nPSCAD/EMTDC software are polluted with white Gaussian noise by con-\nsidering different Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNR) in MATLAB environment.\nFigure 5 Waveform of CT secondary currents with 50% remanence ﬂux.\n36 N. G . Chothani et al.\nThe SNRs are set to 10 db to 40 dB to pollute the original current signals.\nFigure 6 show the saturated and unsaturated CT secondary signals with 0.5Ω\nburden resistance and SNR = 40 db.\nIn this study, the cases classiﬁed correctly and incorrectly are denoted as\nTrue Positive (TP) and True Negative (TN) respectively. The performance\nevaluation of the proposed scheme has been carried out for different types of\nCT secondary signals with varying system parameters over a total of 1840 test\ncases and is presented in Tables 3 and 4. The results have been analyzed for\nboth scenarios: (i) with saturation considered and (ii) without CT saturation\nconsidered. It has been observed from Table 3 that the proposed scheme is\ncapable to discriminate between saturated and unsaturated condition of CT\ngiving a classiﬁcation accuracy of 99.68% and 99.5%, respectively. Also, an\noverall fault classiﬁcation accuracy of 99.67% is obtained which shows the\neffectiveness of the proposed scheme in practical scenario.\nTable 4 demonstrate the performance of the proposed scheme for CT satu-\nration during different type of parameter variations. It has been observed from\nTable 4 that the proposed scheme correctly identiﬁes CT saturation conditions\nFigure 6 Waveform of CT secondary currents during SNR = 40 db.\nTable 3 Overall classiﬁcation accuracy with and without CT saturation\nSVM\nSr. CT Condition Total TP TN Efﬁciency (%)\n1 Saturated (1) 1600 1595 5 99.68\n2 Unsaturated (0) 240 239 1 99.5\nTotal 1840 1834 6 99.67\nSupport V ector Machine based Classiﬁcation of Current Transformer37\nTable 4 Case wise classiﬁcation accuracy for CT saturated data\nSVM\nSr. Different Cases Test Data TP (1) TN (0) Efﬁciency (%)\n1 Fault Inception Angle (FIA) 348 348 0 100\n2 Secondary Burden 348 347 1 99.71\n3 Remnant Flux 348 347 1 99.71\n4 Signal to Noise (SNR) 278 276 2 99.28\n5 X/R Ratio 278 277 1 99.64\nTotal 1600 1595 5 99.68\nwith very high overall fault classiﬁcation accuracy. The results conﬁrm the\neffectiveness of the proposed SVM based technique for discrimination of\nCT secondary current with & without saturation. Result demonstrated in\nTables 3 and 4 conﬁrm that a Statistical Learning Theory (SLT) based SVM\nprovides non-linear classiﬁcation which can be proved to be a more powerful\nmethod compare to neural network and fuzzy based methods. The same has\nbeen observed as an outcome of the result analysis presented in this section.\nAlso, it does not require any post processing of the signal (phasor computation,\nfrequency analysis etc.) hence, can be considered to be more accurate and\nfaster.\n6 Conclusions\nMaloperation in relaying schemes are generated due to CT saturation. So,\npower system protective schemes must be equipped with appropriate mean to\ncorrectly identify saturation condition of CT. In this article, a Support Vector\nMachine (SVM) based algorithm is proposed to distinguish CT saturation\nstate under its various operating conditions. The proposed scheme effectively\ndiscriminates between unsaturated and saturated current signal. Post fault\ncurrent signals of transmission line CT secondary are given as an input to\nSVM. It has been observed that the proposed scheme gives an overall fault\nclassiﬁcation accuracy of more than 99%. Around 1840 simulation cases\nhave been considered for validation of the suggested scheme among the total\nsimulated dataset consisting of 4320 cases with different fault and system\nparameters variations. These cases are generated by considering parameters\nsuch as remanence ﬂux, Fault Inception Angle (FIA), burden resistance and\npresence of DC offset & Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). The proposed technique\nperfectly categorizes different saturation cases with highest efﬁciency and\nhence, found to be superior to the existing schemes.\n38 N. G .
