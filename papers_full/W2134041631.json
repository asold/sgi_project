Pioneer\nstudies of language hemispheric lateralization using Wada test [1]\nhave revealed that about 80% of right-handers (RH) have left\nlanguage lateralization, a finding corroborated by recent investi-\ngations in healthy volunteers (Table 1). Such coincident high\nprevalence of two a priori unrelated phenotypes may indicate\ncommon underpinnings, but the relationship between manual\npreference (MP) and language lateralization must be weak and\ncomplex, because a large majority of healthy LH also has ‘‘typical’’\nleft language lateralization (about 75%, see Table 1). Actually, the\nmost consistent finding regarding this relationship is an increased\noccurrence of atypical language lateralization (whether symmet-\nrical or right-lateralized) in LH as compared to RH. This finding\nhas been reported in both patients using Wada testing and healthy\nvolunteers using either functional transcranial Doppler or func-\ntional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). It is worth noticing\nthat both techniques gave very similar findings despite differences\nin instrumentation and physiological underpinnings, in language\ntasks, and in methods for computing an index of asymmetry\n(Table 1). While functional transcranial Doppler studies and some\nfMRI investigations [2] measured hemispheric asymmetries,\nothers implemented a regional approach based on either one [3]\nor a combination of several regions of interest [4]. In addition, the\nterm ‘‘atypical’’ has different meanings in these studies, since\ndifferent thresholds for segregating typical from atypical subjects\nwere used. For example, the threshold is set to 0 for most\nfunctional transcranial Doppler studies [5–7] while it can be 20 in\nfMRI investigations [2,4]. In addition, atypical individuals can be\nconsidered as belonging to a single category [3,5,8,9] or segregated\nas having either no clear lateralization (also referred to as\nambilateral, or symmetrical) or strong right-hemisphere domi-\nnance (also named strongly-atypical) [4,9–14]. To our knowledge,\nno study has so far investigated whether ambilaterality and right-\nhemisphere dominance are two different language lateralization\nphenotypes or extreme expressions of a continuous atypical\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 June 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e101165\n\nTable 1.Review of some main contributions on the relationship between handedness and language lateralization in healthy volunteers assessed by either functional Magnetic\nResonance Imaging (fMRI) or functional Transcranial Doppler (fTCD).\nAuthor [reference] Task Reference Method Lateralization index MP (ES score) RH LH RH LH\nROI/threshold RH LH (N) (N) %typical %typical\nKnecht [5] covert verbal fluency none fCTD Hemisphere/0 .25 ,25 195 131 94 77\nRosch [6] covert verbal fluency none fCTD Hemisphere/0 ? 20 75\nStroobant [7] covert verbal fluency none fCTD Hemisphere/0 .70 30 90\nWhitehouse [13] covert verbal fluency none fCTD Hemisphere/3 cat .40 ,40 45 30 80 67\n290 161 90 75\nBadzakova [3] covert verbal fluency cross fixation fMRI Fr ROI/0 .0 ,0 107 48 95 81\nBerl [14] semantic decision reverse speech +tone fMRI Fr +Te ROI/9 cat .40 118 98\nBethmann [12] semantic decision letter string matching fMRI Fr +Te ROI/20, 3 cat .33 ,247 26 92\nHung-Georgiadis [11] semantic encoding word spacing fMRI Fr ROI/10 SR SR 17 17 94 53\nPujol [10] covert verbal fluency none fMRI Fr ROI/5 cat SR SR 50 50 96 76\nSpringer [2] semantic decision tone decision fMRI Hemisphere/20 .50 50 94\nSzaflarski [4] covert verbal fluency finger tapping fMRI Combined ROI/20 ,52 50 78\n368 175 96 76\nROI: region of interest used for lateralization index computation (Fr: Frontal, Te: Temporal). threshold: lateralization index value used to segregate typical from atypical language lateralization.

Assessing MP strength (MPS) with\nthe Edinburgh inventory for example, some authors reported a\nlinear relationship between MPS and either occurrence of atypical\nsubjects [5,8] or language lateralization index [4]. However, others\ndid not find such a correlation between such lateralization index\nand MPS [9,15], or found one that did not survive exclusion of LH\n[15]. Some of these discrepancies may be due to statistical power\nlimitations and it is noticeable that only one study in the literature\nexamined a sample of more than 50 LH [5] but did not report on\nthe relationship between actual values of the lateralization index\nand Edinburgh inventory.\nThe goal of the present study was thus to establish the\ndistribution of language lateralization in a large sample of LH in\norder to 1- investigate whether two groups of atypical subjects\ncould be identified, 2- compare this distribution to that of RH, and\n3- examine its relationship with the MP strength distribution.\nMaterials and Methods\nWe recruited 153 LH and 144 RH healthy volunteers, mea-\nsured their manual preference strength (MPS), and evaluated their\nhemispheric lateralization for language with fMRI during covert\nproduction of sentences and word lists. Note that the sample of\nparticipants of this study is not representative of the general\npopulation, as it was deliberately enriched in left-handers aiming\nat a 50/50 ratio.\n1. Participants\nParticipants were recruited within the framework of the\nBIL&GIN project, a multimodal imaging/psychometric/genetic\ndatabase specifically designed for studying the structural and\nfunctional neural correlates of brain lateralization [16]. The\nComite´ pour la Protection des Personnes dans la Recherche\nBiome´dicale de Basse-Normandie approved the study protocol. All\nthe 297 participants (152 men, 145 women) gave their informed,\nwritten consent, and received an allowance for their participation.\nAll participants were free of brain abnormality as assessed by an\ninspection of their structural T1-MRI scans by a trained\nradiologist. Sample mean age was 25.3 years (S.D. = 6.4 years,\nrange: [18, 57] years), and sample mean level of education was\n15.662.3 years (range: [11,20] years), corresponding to almost 5\nyears of education after the baccalaureate. Skull perimeter of each\nparticipant was measured, men having significantly larger SP than\nwomen (Men: 58.261.5 cm, Women: 55.661.4 cm, p,0.0001,\nStudent-t test).\n2. Participant manual lateralization\n2.1 Self-reported handedness. Participants were asked to\nreport whether they considered themselves as right- or left-handed:\n144 declared themselves RH (including 72 women), and 153 LH\n(including 73 women). Among the latter, 4 women declared\nthemselves as converted RH. Note that all individuals who\ndeclared themselves as RH used their right hand for writing. Note\nalso that during the fMRI tasks, LH subjects were free to choose\nthe hand they preferred for using the response pad, and that 135\nused their right hand and 18 their left-hand (including 5 women).\nSelf-reported LH were 2.6 years younger than RH (RH: 26.566.2\nyears, LH: 23.968.3 years, p,0.0005, Student-t test), and had 1\nyear of education less than RH (RH 16.162.2 years, LH 15.162.3\nyears, p = 0.0002, Student-t test).\n2.2 Manual preference strength.MPS was quantified using\nthe score at the Edinburgh inventory [17], a series of 10 items\ndealing with the subject-preferred hand for manipulating objects\nand tools. In the present study, we only used 9 of these 10 items,\ndropping the ‘‘broom’’ item since very few young people had\nenough familiarity with this tool. Sample distribution of MPS is\nshown in Figure 1. Values ranged from2100 (strong LH) to+100\n(strong RH), average MPS values being 93.1 (S.D. = 11.0) for RH,\n260.0 (S.D. = 41.0) for LH subjects who used their right hand for\nthe response pad, and 283.8 (S.D. = 22.0) for LH subjects\nresponding with left hand, the three subgroups being significantly\ndifferent from one another.\nIn order to compare our results with previous studies, MPS was\ntransformed as an ordinal variable having either 3 or 7 levels,\nnamed MPS3 and MPS7, respectively. For MPS3, we used\nthresholds as close as possible to the 1\nst and 2nd terciles of MPS\ndistribution. For MPS7, we used the same MPS category\nthresholds as previously defined by others (Knecht et al., 2000b).\nValues of thresholds and occurrences for each category and each\nvariable are shown in Table 2.\n3. FMRI of language production\nWe evaluated hemispheric dominance for language production\nusing an index of asymmetry derived from functional MR maps\ncontrasting covert production of sentences (SENT) with covert\nrecitation of a list of overlearned words, namely the months of the\nyear from January to December (LIST).\n3.1 Sentence and word list production tasks. Subjects\nwere presented white line drawing pictures on a black screen\nwhich were either cartoons depicting a scene involving characters,\nor a scrambled version of these pictures (Figure 2). Pictures\ncovered a 14u614u visual area and were presented for 1 sec. Right\nafter the presentation of a picture, subjects had to covertly\ngenerate either a sentence (SENT) when they saw a cartoon or to\nenunciate the ordered list of the months of the year (LIST) when\nthey saw a scrambled picture.\nFor SENT, subjects were instructed to generate sentences each\nhaving the same structure, starting with a subject (The little boy,\nThe gentleman…) and a complement (with his satchel… in\nshorts… with glasses…), followed by a verb describing the action\ntaking place, ending with another complement of place (in the\nstreet… in the playground… on the beach…) or of manner (with\nhappiness… nastily…). During this generation period, participants\nhad to fixate a white-cross displayed at the center of the screen and\nto press the pad with their index finger when they had finished\nenouncing the sentence covertly. For LIST, participants had to\ncovertly recite the ordered list of months of the year and to press\nthe pad when they had finished.\nNote that a low-level reference task followed each event (SENT\nor LIST), consisting in sustaining visual fixation on the central\ncross and pressing the pad when the fixation cross was switched to\na square (both stimulus covering a 0.8u60.8u visual area). This\nsecond part of the trial, that lasted at least half the total trial\nduration, aimed at refocusing the participant attention on a non-\nverbal stimulus and to control for the manual motor response.\nEach trial was 18 sec long, the time limit for response being\n9 sec including the 1-sec picture display. A 12-sec presentation of a\nfixation crosshair preceded and followed the first and last trial of\neach run. This slow-event related experimental paradigm\nrandomly alternated 10 trials of sentence generation with 10 trials\nof recitation of a list of months. Overall, the fMRI run lasted\nHandedness and Language Lateralization\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 June 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e101165\n6 min 24 sec, response time in reciting each list of words or\ngenerating each sentence being recorded using a fiber optic pad.\nIn order to ensure proper execution of both tasks, participants\nwere trained outside the scanner, in the hour preceding the fMRI\nsession. Training included both overt and covert generation of\nsentences and word lists, using sets of drawings that were different\nfrom those used during the fMRI session.\nRight after the session, participants were asked to rate the\ndifficulty of the task on a 5-level scale, and to recall each sentence\nthey covertly generated during the fMRI session with the support\nof the pictures they saw. This makes it possible to evaluate the\naverage number of words of covertly generated sentences for each\nparticipant. Note that the average time for sentence generation in\nthe magnet was positively correlated with the average sentence\nnumber of words measured during debriefing (r = 0.18, p ,\n0.0001).\n3.2 Anatomical and functional images\nacquisition. Imaging was performed on a Philips Achieva\n3Tesla MRI scanner. The structural MRI protocol consisted of a\nlocalizer scan, a high resolution 3D T 1-weighted volume\nacquisition (TR = 20 ms; TE = 4.6 ms; flip angle = 10u; inversion\ntime = 800 ms; turbo field echo factor = 65; sense factor = 2;\nmatrix size = 25662566180; 1 mm3 isotropic voxel size) and a\nT2\n*-weighted multi-slice acquisition (T 2*-FFE sequence,\nTR = 3,500 ms; TE = 35 ms; flip angle = 90u; sense factor = 2; 70\naxial slices; 2 mm3 isotropic voxel size). Functional volumes were\nacquired with a T2\n*-weighted echo planar imaging acquisition\n(192 volumes; TR = 2 s; TE = 35 ms; flip angle = 80u; 31 axial\nslices; 3.75 mm3 isotropic voxel size) covering the same field of\nview than the T2*-FFE acquisition.\n3.3 Functional volume processing: individual ‘‘SENT\nversus LIST’’ contrast and t-maps. Image analysis was\nperformed using the SPM5 software (www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/\n). The T\n1-weighted scans of the participants were normalized to\nour site-specific template (T1-80 TVS) matching the MNI space,\nusing the SPM5 ‘‘segment’’ procedure with default parameters\nallowing for segmentation of grey matter, white matter and\ncerebrospinal fluid components for each participant.\nIn order to correct for motion during the fMRI run, each of the\n192 EPI-BOLD scans was realigned to the first one using a rigid-\nbody registration. The participant EPI-BOLD scans were then\nrigidly registered to his structural T\n2\n*-weighted image, which was\nitself registered to his T1-weighted scan. The combination of all\nregistration matrices allowed each EPI-BOLD functional scan to\nbe warped into the standard MNI space using a tri-linear\ninterpolation, with subsequent smoothing using a 6-mm FWHM\nGaussian filtering.\nWe then computed for each participant the BOLD signal\ndifference map and associated t-map corresponding to the ‘‘SENT\nminus LIST’’ contrast.\n3.4 Probabilistic ‘‘SENT versus LIST’’ contrast-map in\nthe 144 RH. In the present study, we have used a language\nproduction task (SENT) and a reference task (LIST) somewhat\ndifferent from those used by previous investigators in the field (see\nTable 1). Accordingly, in order to document the pattern of\nactivation elicited by SENT as compared to LIST, and specifically\nto show that, as expected, a left-lateralized activation in the\nlanguage network was present in RH, we computed a within RH-\ngroup probability activation map using individual t-maps binar-\nized at a 1.96 threshold.\n3.5 Individual Hemispheric Functional lateralization\nIndex computation. For each individual, we computed a\nHemispheric Functional Lateralization Index (HFLI) for language\nproduction (HFLI) using the LI-toolbox applied to the ‘‘SENT\nminus LIST’’ individual t-map [18]. HFLI was computed with a\nbootstrap algorithm using a threshold set at t = 0 (positive t-map), a\nlower bootstrap sample of 5 voxels and higher sample size of 1,000\nvoxels, and a resample ratio of k = 0.25. HFLI was computed\nwithin the grey and white matter anatomical template masks used\nfor the fMRI data normalization, excluding the cerebellum. The\nweighted HFLI means were reported (see Table S1), values\nranging between2100 and+100, with2100 being a purely right\nand +100 a purely left activation.\nFigure 1.

Statistical analysis\nAll statistical procedures were conducted using the JMP11 Pro\nsoftware package, (www.jmp.com, SAS Institute Inc., 2012).\n4.1 Fitting HFLI sample distribution by Gaussian mixture\nmodels; definition of different types of language\nhemispheric lateralization. HFLI probability density func-\ntion was modeled separately for LH and RH. Because of its\nmultimodal aspect for either handedness group, a phenomenon\npreviously noticed by others [19], HFLI probability density\nfunction was modeled using a mixture ofn Gaussian components,\nnamely:\nX\ni~n\ni~1\npiN mi,siðÞ , i~1:::n\nwhere N mi,siðÞ denoted the probability density function of a\nGaussian distribution with meanmi and variances2\ni , pi being the\nweight of the ith Gaussian component in the HFLI distribution\n(Pi~n\ni~1\npi~1). For each handedness group, the optimal model was\nselected as having the lowest corrected Akaike’s information\ncriterion [20], an index that combines goodness of fit with a\npenalty increasing with the number of model parameters. All fits\nwere performed using the ‘‘Continuous fit’’ procedure of the\nJMP11 Pro software, that estimates Gaussian distribution param-\neters m\ni,si,piðÞ using a maximum likelihood criterion and a quasi-\nNewton optimization algorithm.\nFor both LH and RH, the optimal model, and corresponding\noptimal number of Gaussian functions (nopt), were then used for\ndefining types of language hemispheric lateralization, using lower\nand upper HFLI thresholds best segregating the n\nopt Gaussian\nfunctions from each other. These thresholds were then used for\nassigning each participant a language lateralization type based on\nhis individual HFLI value.\nIn order to compare our results, a Gaussian mixture model was\nalso fit to the HFLI distribution observed over the entire sample of\nsubjects.\nAlso, in order to compare with previous studies, we used the\nclassical 2-category language lateralization classification obtained\nusing a zero threshold on HFLI distribution, subjects having a\npositive (resp. negative) HFLI value being declared typical (resp.\natypical).\n4.2 Comparison of behavioral variables and cognitive\nabilities in groups having different handedness and\nlanguage lateralization types. Performances in the two tasks\ncompleted during the fMRI acquisitions were compared between\ngroups of different handedness and language hemispheric lateral-\nization types using an ANOVA of the response time for sentence\nand list generation, as well as of the mean number of words\ngenerated in sentences. Age, educational level, and sex were\nincluded as confounding factors. In order to ensure that the report\nmade by the subject was consistent, we computed the correlation\nbetween the mean number of words per sentence and the mean\ntime taken for their generation.\n4.3 Relationship between hemispheric lateralization for\nlanguage and self-reported handedness. As emphasized in\nthe Introduction section, various statistical approaches have been\nused for assessing the relationship between lateralization for\nlanguage and manual preference, depending on whether these\nvariables were considered as continuous, ordinal, or nominal. In\nthe present study, we have implemented these different statistical\nanalyses in order to be able to compare our findings with those of\nprevious investigators and to demonstrate their robustness.\nTable 2.Boundaries and occurrences (in number of subjects (N) or fraction of the total sample size (in %) of the different manual preference strength (MPS) categories using\neither a 3-level (MPS3) or a 7-level scale (MPS7, as in [5]).\nMPS3 [ 2100, 255] [ 254, 99] 100\nN 99 100 98\n% 33.3 33.7 33.0\nMPS7 2100 [ 299, 275] [ 275, 225] [ 225, 25] [25, 75] [75, 99] 100\nN 5 2 3 14 22 4 1 2 3 8 9 8\n% 17.5 9.1 15.5 7.7 4.4 12.8 33.0\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0101165.t002\nHandedness and Language Lateralization\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 5 June 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e101165\nAn ANOVA examined the effect of handedness on HFLI value,\nincluding sex, age, level of education and skull perimeter as\nconfounding variables. This analysis, similar to that performed by\nprevious investigators [4,10], aimed at testing whether there was a\nsignificant difference in the HFLI average values between RH and\nLH.\nUsing the categorical transformation of HFLI, we also\nexamined an association between language lateralization type\nand handedness (Fisher exact test). This analysis, also implemented\nby others [3,13,21,22], aimed at testing whether there was a\nsignificant difference in the proportions of language lateralization\ntypes between RH and LH.\nFinally, we implemented an original approach based on the\nkappa statistic [23] that is specially suited for measuring the degree\nof chance-corrected concordance between the hemisphere con-\ntralateral to the preferred hand (Left or non-Left) and the\nhemisphere dominant for language (Left or non-Left), pooling\nStrongly-atypicals and Ambilaterals in the same language lateral-\nization category (non-Left dominant). This analysis aimed at\ntesting whether there was a significant concordance in hemispheric\ndominance for language production and for the preferred hand in\nthe entire sample, taking into account the concordance that one\ncan expect by chance alone. In order to compare our results, we\nalso measured the kappa statistic when using a 2-category\nlanguage lateralization classification defined using a 0 threshold\non HFLI values, as done by others [3,9].\nIn order to assess the impact of Strongly-atypical subjects on the\nresults, all analyses were repeated after excluding this subgroup\nfrom the sample.\n4.4 Relationship between hemispheric lateralization for\nlanguage and manual preference strength. Here again,\ndifferent statistical analyses were implemented with the same\nmotivations as in the previous subsection 4.3.\n(a) First, we studied the correlation between MPS and HFLI\nvalues as was done by others [2,9,11,15]. However, because\nboth MPS and HFLI probability density function’s markedly\ndiffered from normality, correlation between HFLI and\nMPS values was investigated using a Spearman rank rather\nthan a Pearson’s correlation statistic, in each handedness\ngroup as well as in the entire sample.\n(b) Considering the MPS3 categorical version of MPS, an\nANOVA examined the effect of MPS3 on HFLI, including\nsex, age, level of education and skull perimeter as\nconfounding variables. Similar analyses have been reported\nby others [5,13].\n(c) Conversely, an ANOVA examined the effect of language\nlateralization types (defined using the 3-category version of\nHFLI) on MPS values, including the same confounding\nvariables as in b).\n(d) Then, considering categorical versions of both HFLI and\nMPS, we examined an association between language\nlateralization and MPS3, an approach similar to that of\nIsaacs et al. [8].\n(e) In addition, we also used the original approach of the kappa\nstatistic for measuring the degree of agreement between the\n3-level ordinal variables language lateralization and MPS3.\n(f) Finally, in order to compare our results, we also conducted\nthe same analysis than that of Knecht et al [5], searching for\na linear relationship between the occurrence of atypical\nindividuals (pooling again Ambilateral and Strongly-atypical\nindividuals) and the 7-level ordinal version of MPS (MPS7).\nAs before, all analyses, except c) and e), were performed either\nwith or without including Strongly-atypicals.\nResults\n1. SENT versus LIST contrast activation probability map in\nthe RH subgroup\nThe activation probability map (Figure 3) shows that more than\n80% of the RH participants presented activation in the lower part\nof the precentral gyrus and the inferior frontal gyrus of the left\nhemisphere. High probability activation sites were also observed in\nthe posterior part of the left superior temporal sulcus and its\ntermination, in the posterior part of the left middle temporal gyrus\nand within the vicinity of the inferior part of the left anterior\noccipital sulcus. In the right hemisphere, the regions activated by\nat least 80% of the participants were located in the occipital lobe at\nthe junction of the middle and inferior temporal gyri, and, to a\nlimited extent, in the inferior frontal gyrus and anterior part of the\nsuperior temporal sulcus.\n2. Fitting the HFLI sample distribution by Gaussian\nmixture models\nDistributions of HFLI values in LH and RH and corresponding\nmixture of Gaussian fits are shown in Figure 4. Both largely\ndeparted from normal, being both multimodal and skewed\ntowards negative values because of symmetrical or rightward-\nasymmetrical individuals.\nOptimal fits of the HFLI distributions were obtained with\nmixtures of 3 and 4 Gaussian functions for the RH and LH\ngroups, respectively (Table 3). Estimates of optimal model\nparameters are given in Table 4 and demonstrate that HFLI\ndistribution in RH and LH were quite similar, except for an\nFigure 2.

Right after presentation of a picture, the subject had to covertly generate either the list of the months of the year (right part) ora\nsentence describing the cartoon (left part). During this generation period, participants had to fixate a white-cross displayed at the center of the\nscreen and to press the pad with their index finger when they had finished. Note that a reference task followed each event, consisting in sustaining\nvisual fixation on the cross and pressing the pad when the fixation cross was switched to a square.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0101165.g002\nHandedness and Language Lateralization\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 6 June 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e101165\nadditional Gaussian function (G4) in the model of the LH group\nHFLI distribution. This additional Gaussian function accounted\nfor a small group of individuals (N = 10) having strongly negative\nHFLI values (average263, range [272, 255]). Such individuals\nshowed strong right hemisphere lateralization for language\nproduction. Based on our sample, such a strongly atypical\nlanguage lateralization seems very rare, occurring at a frequency\nof about 6.5% in LH only, meaning in less than 1% in the general\npopulation (assuming a 10% prevalence of LH).\nExcept for these 10 subjects and the associated G4 component,\nHFLI distribution was characterized by 3 components for either\nRH or LH. The first two components (G1 and G2) gathered\nsubjects with largely positive HFLI values, thus having a typical\nleft lateralization for language production. These two Gaussian\ncomponents, that accounted for 87.7% and 78.0% of the RH and\nLH probability density function, respectively, had moments that\ndiffered between the two groups. Indeed, G1 and G2 means were\nslightly but significantly larger in LH than in RH (71.5 versus 65.3,\nand 52.0 versus 43.9, respectively, p ,0.05 in both cases).\nMeanwhile, G1 accounted for a larger fraction of the whole\ndistribution in RH than in LH (67% versus 37%), the reverse\nbeing observed for G2 (20% for RH versus 41% in LH). As for the\nvariance of these components, they were comparable for G1, and\nlarger in LH than in RH for G2.\nThe third component (G3) appeared to have similar parameter\nvalues in both groups: a mean parameter close to 0 (4.4 in RH and\n28.2 in LH), and a standard deviation around 17. This\ncomponent concerned subjects with either weak or no lateraliza-\ntion for language production, who will be referred to as\nAmbilateral. Interestingly, this component represented similar\nfractions of the overall distribution in RH and LH (12.2% in RH\nand 15.4% in LH).\nFitting HFLI distribution of the entire sample of LH and RH\ngave results very consistent with those reported above: the optimal\nfit was obtained with a mixture of 4 Gaussian functions with\nestimated means, variance and proportions equal to (67, 46,24,\nand 263), (7.9, 8.4, 19.3, and 5.3) and (57.5%, 25.7%, 13.3%, and\n3.3%), respectively. Note, in particular, that, the fourth compo-\nnent was identical to the G4 component observed when fitting the\nHFLI distribution of the LH subsample (see Figure 4).\n3. Definition and characteristics of different types of\nlateralization for language production\nUsing local minima of the optimal Gaussian mixture model\nfunction, thresholds could be easily identified for segregating the\nGaussian components having the lowest HFLI means (G4 from\nG3 in LH, and G3 from G2 for both RH and LH, see Figure 4).\nOn the contrary, there was a considerable overlap between the 2\nGaussian components having the largest mean values (G1 and G2\nin Table 4) which led us to pool the latter two components ending\nwith 3 subgroups having different types of language hemispheric\nlateralization based on their HFLI values: individuals with an\nHFLI positive and larger than 18 were declared Typical (130 RH,\n120 LH), those with an HFLI value between250 and 18 were\ndeclared Ambilateral (14 RH, 23 LH), and those with HFLI\nvalues below 250 were declared Strongly-atypical (10 LH).\nCharacteristics of the three so defined language lateralization\nsubgroups are given in Table 5 for both LH and RH. Note that,\nidentical thresholds and classification would be observed if\nGaussian component parameters had been derived from mixture\nmodeling of the whole sample HFLI distribution for. In order to\ncompare our results, Table 5 also reports values obtained when\nusing the classical 2-category classification. Using the latter\napproach, occurrences of typical individuals reached 94.4% and\n83.7% in RH and LH, respectively.\n4. Comparison of behavioral variables and cognitive\nabilities in groups having different handedness and\nlanguage lateralization types\nTypical, Ambilateral and Strongly-atypical subjects did not\nsignificantly differ as regards their performances on tasks executed\nduring fMRI acquisition, whether considering the number of\nwords generated per sentence or the response time for sentence or\nfor word list generation (see Table 6). Note that no difference was\nobserved when classifying subjects in 2 groups, having either\npositive or negative HFLI during SENT. The same result was\nfound for task difficulty that did not differ between lateralization\ntypes and did not vary with handedness. Moreover, there was no\ndifference in performance between LH and RH, and no difference\nbetween LH using different response hands.\nFigure 3.

Relationship between hemispheric lateralization for\nlanguage and self-reported handedness\nAverage HFLI values were larger in RH (53.5622.7, mean 6\nS.D.) than in LH (43.2640.0), the difference being significant\n(p = 0.001, ANOVA). Note that HFLI variance was larger in LH\nthan in RH (p,10\n24). There was no effect of sex (p = 0.28), age\n(p = 0.08), educational level (p = 0.9) or skull perimeter (p = 0.12).\nAfter exclusion of the 10 Strongly-atypical subjects, average HFLI\nfor LH was 49.8 (S.D. = 29.4) and did not significantly differ from\nthat of RH (p = 0.11, ANOVA).\nTable 7 shows the contingency table between language\nlateralization and handedness. A significant association was found\nbetween these two variables (Fisher’s exact test p = 0.0065) due to\nthe fact that there was no Strongly-atypical RH. As a matter of\nfact, discarding the 10 Strongly-atypical subjects from the analysis,\nmade this association no longer significant (Fisher’s exact test\np = 0.11).\nThe kappa statistic was low but significantly different from 0\nwhen considering the entire sample (k = 0.11, p = 0.006), but not\nwhen excluding the 10 Strongly-atypicals (k = 0.063, p = 0.11),\nmeaning that agreement between hemispheric dominance for\nhand preference and for language was barely above the chance\nlevel. Using a 0-threshold for defining language lateralization\ncategories gave very similar results whether including Strongly-\natypicals or not (k = 0.105, p = 0.005, andk = 0.049, p = 0.13,\nrespectively).\n6. Relationship between hemispheric lateralization for\nlanguage production and manual preference strength\nFigure 5 shows the plot of HFLI versus MPS values.\na) Spearman rank correlation coefficient between MPS and\nHFLI did not significantly differ from 0, neither for RH\n(r = 20.069, p = 0.40), nor for LH (r = 0.059, p = 0.46), nor\nfor the entire sample (r = 0.057, p = 0.32). Discarding the 10\nStrongly-atypicals did not result in significant correlation\n(LH: r = 20.089, p = 0.91, RH+LH: r = 20.011, p = 0.84).\nb) A significant effect of MPS3 on HFLI values was found\n(p = 0.0015, ANOVA), strong LH having lower HFLI\naverage values than either strong RH (38.3 versus 51.9,\np = 0.0016) or individuals with moderate MPS (38.3 versus\n53.1, p = 0.0019). This effect vanished when discarding the\n10 Strongly-atypicals from the sample (p = 0.37, ANOVA).\nc) Conversely, a significant effect of language lateralization type\non MPS values was observed (p,10\n24, ANOVA), average\nMPS values of Strongly-atypicals (287.3) being significantly\ndifferent from that of either Typicals (20.0, p ,1024)o r\nAmbilaterals (29.6, p = 0.023), Typicals and Ambilaterals\nbeing also different (p = 0.01). Looking separately at RH and\nLH revealed that, Typical and Ambilateral RH subjects did\nnot differ as regards their MPS average values (p = 0.60, see\nTable 5). Meanwhile, a significant difference was present in\nLH subjects between the Typical, Strongly-atypical and\nAmbilateral subgroups (p = 0.045, ANOVA, Table 5), due to\na stronger left hand preference in Strongly-atypical LH than\nin Typical LH (p = 0.035, post-hoc Student’s t-test), while\nAmbilateral LH did not differ from either Typical LH\n(p = 0.12) or Strongly-atypical LH (p = 0.37).\nd) Consistent findings were observed when looking at the\nrelationships between language lateralization and MPS3\ncategorical variables. Table 8 shows the contingency between\nthese two variables that were found to be significantly\nassociated (Fisher’s exact test, p = 0.001) due to the absence of\nindividuals both strongly RH and Strongly-atypical. As a\nmatter of fact, removing the 10 Strongly-atypical individuals\nfrom the sample turned the association to be no longer\nsignificant (Fisher’s exact test, p = 0.11). This was further\nconfirmed when looking separately at the RH and LH\ngroups, since non-significant association was found between\nlanguage lateralization and MPS3 both for RH (Fisher’s exact\nFigure 4.

Summary of the results\nIn a large sample of healthy individuals, balanced for\nhandedness, Gaussian mixture modeling of the distribution of\nhemispheric functional asymmetries during sentence production\nidentified 3 types of lateralization, namely Typical (left-lateralized),\nAmbilateral (no lateralization) and Strongly-atypical (right-lateral-\nized), the last category being rare (less than 1% prevalence) and\nincluding only LH. Excluding these rare subjects, we measured a\nconcordance between dominant hemispheres for language and for\nthe preferred hand that was not above what could be expected to\noccur by chance only, this being true both for RH and for LH. In\nLH, a significant association was observed between the strength of\nlateralization for language and the strength of manual preference,\nbut this relationship was largely explained by the existence of the\nsmall group of Strongly-atypical individuals who had both strong\nleft hand preference and strong right hemisphere dominance for\nlanguage.\nDiscussion\n1. Methodological issues\nLanguage production has long been known as the most\nlateralized language task as compared to speech listening that\nelicits smaller leftward asymmetries [7,24,25]. Sentence produc-\ntion functional asymmetries have been demonstrated to be in\nstrong accordance with language lateralization as measured with\nWada procedure [26], language tasks involving sentence leading to\nTable 4.Comparison of HFLI optimal Gaussian mixture function model parameters for the RH and LH samples.\nG1 G2 G3 G4\nm1 [95% CI] m2 [95% CI] m3 [95% CI] m4 [95% CI]\nRH 65.3 [63.7, 66.9] 43.9 [42.0, 45.8] 4.4 [ 23.8, 12.7] –\nLH 71.5 [69.9, 73.0] 52.0 [49.4, 54.6] 28.2 [214.9, 21.6] 263.6 [267.0, 260.3]\ns1 [95% CI] s2 [95% CI] s3 [95% CI] s4 [95% CI]\nRH 8.1 [6.7, 9.8] 5.3 [3.8, 7.4] 17.7 [12.1, 26.0] –\nLH 6.0 [4.6, 7.7] 10.6 [8.4, 13.4] 16.4 [11.6, 23.2] 5.4 [2.7, 10.8]\np1 [95% CI] p2 [95% CI] p3 [95% CI] p4 [95% CI]\nRH 67.4 [52.9, 79.2] 20.3 [13.9, 28.7] 12.2 [7.5, 19.1] –\nLH 36.7 [27.7, 46.7] 41.3 [31.7, 51.7] 15.4 [10.1, 22.7] 6.5 [3.4, 11.9]\nEach Gaussian function is characterized by its mean (mi), standard deviation (si) and fractional contribution (pi) for i = 1…n.

The use of an active control task involving\noverlearned and automatic recitation of words in mother-tongue,\nand globally balanced with the sentence production task in terms\nof the number of words to be enounced, helped to subtract out\ncomponents common to both tasks, thereby enhancing the\ndetection of areas involved in lexico-semantic and syntactic\nprocessing.\nIn the present work we designed a language production\nparadigm that allowed for an investigation of inter-individual\nvariability of hemispheric asymmetries of sentence processing\nareas. We chose to rely on a very familiar and overlearned list of\nwords because it constitutes a high-level reference task in mother\ntongue that was balanced with the sentence task in terms of\namount of verbal stimuli to be processed.\nThis paradigm allowed for obtaining robust asymmetrical\ncontrast maps at the individual level, and its reliability is evidenced\nby the proportion of RH having a HFLI.0 (94.4%) strongly\nconcordant with existing literature, and independent of the\nmethod used or of the production paradigm applied. As a matter\nof fact, we observed a proportion of RH with positive HFLI\nidentical to that observed by others who used fCTD during a word\nfluency task (Table 1, [19]). In addition, the sentence minus list\nprobabilistic contrast map obtained in the 144 RH illustrates the\ninvolvement of the inferior frontal gyrus and posterior STS area by\nthis sentence production task, as well as their strong leftward\nasymmetry. This confirms the pertinence of the present paradigm\nfor the determination of individual hemispheric asymmetries of\nlanguage areas.\nDefinition of language lateralization categories in our study\ndiffers from previous works that were based on arbitrary thresholds\n(see Table 1). Using a large sample balanced for handedness and\nunsupervised Gaussian mixture modeling, we identified three non-\noverlapping lateralization types tailored to the multimodal nature\nof the HFLI distribution. This resulted in the inclusion of 19\nindividuals (9 RH and 10 LH) having a small but positive\nasymmetry index in the Ambilateral group, who would have\notherwise been considered as typical. Moreover, use of Gaussian\nmixture modeling was also important in segregating a subgroup of\nindividuals (Strongly-atypicals) having much lower mean HFLI\nthan Ambilaterals.\nBecause typical subjects represent 90% of the population, it is\nimportant to assess whether or not they constitute a homogeneous\ngroup with respect to hemispheric dominance. Gaussian mixture\nmodel suggests the existence two distinct subgroups of typical\nindividuals, having strong and moderate left language lateraliza-\ntion, respectively, this holding both for RH and for LH. However,\nbecause of the overlap between the two Gaussian distributions\nassociated to these two putative groups (G1 and G2), it was not\npossible to reliably assign Typical subjects to either group. As\nproposed by others, additional variables, including regional\npatterns of functional asymmetry, may be necessary for identifying\nthese subgroups and the factors that explain their differences [28].\nFinally, it is worth mentioning that in the present studies we\nused two measures of handedness, namely self-report and hand\npreference inventory, for investigating the relationship between\nhandedness and hemispheric dominance for language. Other\nmeasures could have been used, such as relative hand skill or\nperformance at a reaching task. However, a recent report indicates\nthat none of these different measures emerged as clearly superior\nTable 6.Comparison of fMRI session performances in groups varying in manual preference or lateralization type.\nBehavioral control during fMRI RH LH p Typical Ambilateral Strongly-atypical p\nSelf rating of task difficulty (/5) 2.79 (0.09) 2.67 (0.09) 0.57 2.71 (0.07) 2.71 (0.18) 3.20 (0.34) 0.36\nNumber of words per sentence 12.3 (0.17) 12.5 (0.17) 0.41 12.4 (0.12) 12.0 (0.32) 13.4 (0.94) 0.17\nRT sentence production (ms) 5597 (90) 5618 (77) 0.85 5608 (58) 5576 (167) 5676 (391) 0.94\nRT word list production (ms) 5228 (96) 5234 (93) 0.98 5219 (70) 5363 (198) 4974 (428) 0.69\np value corresponds to the results of an ANOVA entering sex, age, SP and educational level as covariates (RT: response time, N: number).

Occurrence of the different language lateralization\ntypes in RH and LH\nUsing Gaussian mixture modeling-based classification, we found\n90% of RH exhibiting typical language lateralization. This\nproportion increased to 94% with the usual binary classification\nbased on a zero-threshold on HFLI. Such proportions are in\nagreement (see Table 1) with previous imaging investigations of\nlanguage production dominance in RH healthy volunteers using\neither fMRI [2,10] or functional transcranial Doppler [19]. With\nsuch a binary classification, atypical language lateralization\noccurred in 6.5% of our RH sample, identical to the 6% reported\nby Springer using fMRI and word generation [2], and by Mateer\nand Dodrill in epileptic patients using Wada testing [22].\nRegarding LH, the 78% proportion of LH with typical language\nlateralization using the 3-group classification rose to 84% with the\nbinary approach, identical to figures reported by Szaflarski et al.\nwith fMRI during word production [4]. With that same binary\nclassification, the proportion of atypical LH (16%) in our study was\nidentical to that of Springer et al [2].\nTable 7.Contingency table of language hemispheric lateralization type by self-reported handedness.\nLanguage lateralization type\nHandedness Typical Ambilateral Strongly-atypical All\nRH 130 (0.44) 14 (0.047) 0 (0.00) 144 (0.49)\nLH 120 (0.40) 23 (0.077) 10 (0.033) 153 (0.51)\nAll 250 (0.84) 37 (0.12) 10 (0.033) 297 (1.00)\nLanguage lateralization types were derived from Gaussian mixture modeling of the probability density function of hemispheric functional lateralization index measured\nwith fMRI.

HFLI, an index of hemispheric\nfunctional lateralization for language measured with fMRI during covert generation of sentences compared to covert generation of list of words, was\nused for classifying subjects as « Typical » (HFLI.50, bright color symbols), « Ambilateral» (220,HFLI,50, pale color symbols), or « Strongly-atypical »\n(HFLI,220, open symbols).\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0101165.g005\nHandedness and Language Lateralization\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 12 June 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e101165\nOverall, atypical language lateralization was found more\nfrequent in LH than in RH, in agreement with pioneer\nneuropsychological studies conducted by He´caen [29]. However,\nthe difference in atypical language lateralization frequency was not\nsignificant because non-typical language lateralization frequency\nin RH was far from negligible, ranging in our study from 6% to\n10% depending on the threshold used for segregating typical from\nnon-typical language lateralization. Note that this result cannot be\nattributed to inter-individual variability in task difficulty, known to\ntrigger increased right hemisphere attentional resources, since\nthere was no difference in performance or in subjective task\ndifficulty between RH and LH.\n3. Right-hemisphere dominance for language is rare and\npresent in LH only\nAmong non left-dominant language lateralization individuals,\nGaussian mixture modeling segregated a subgroup of individuals\nwith right hemisphere language dominance, confirming the\nexistence of this rare but normal variant of language organization\n[5,10,21]. Based on the 6.5% proportion of Strongly-atypical LH\nobserved in this study, one can estimate a 0.6% prevalence for\nright-hemisphere language lateralization in the general population\n(assuming a 10% LH prevalence). This finding is in accordance\nwith the 8% of LH having an HFLI value below 220 in\nSzaflarski’s study (see Figure 2 of [4]) as well as with the 10% of\nLH having an HFLI value below225 in Pujol’s study (see Table\nof [10]). It also fits well with a recent review of 1,208 Wada testing\nof epileptic patients, in which right hemisphere language\ndominance has been observed in 7% of LH patients free from\nleft hemisphere damage [30].\nIn our sample, right-hemisphere dominance was observed only\nin LH, in agreement with previous studies that reported no case of\nrightward dominance in healthy RH subjects during verb\ngeneration [2,10,19]. In patients, there have been reports of\naphasia after a right-hemisphere lesion in LH [29], as well as of a\nlarge prevalence of left-handedness (8 among 9) in epileptic\npatients with right language dominance as assessed by the Wada\ntest [22]. Therefore, Strongly-atypical individuals appear to form a\nparticular group characterized by joint strong right hemisphere\ndominance both for language and for hand, as evidenced by their\n287 average Edinburgh score. Such an association between\nstrength of left-handedness and right hemisphere language\nlateralization is in agreement with previous studies using either\nWada test [8] or fMRI [4]. It raises the issue of a genetic origin of\nthis rare combination of phenotypes. So far, the search for genetic\nvariants at the origin of handedness has been unfruitful (see [31]\nfor review). Focusing on this subgroup of Strongly-atypical\nsubjects, using new generation sequencing techniques, might offer\nthe opportunity of uncovering some genetic variants involved in\nthe co-variance between handedness and language hemispheric\nlateralization.\n4. Hand lateralization and language dominance are\nassociated by chance, except in right-hemisphere\ndominant individuals\nAn important finding of our study is that, when ignoring this\ngroup of rare Strongly-atypical individuals, we found no significant\nchance-corrected agreement between hemispheric dominance for\nhand and hemispheric dominance for language production. Given\nthe 90% of right-handedness and 90% of left-hemisphere\ndominance in the general population, this result may at first sight\nseem counterintuitive. However, one should remember that, due\nto this joint high prevalence, a high level of agreement between\nthese two traits is expected due to chance only, namely in about\n81% of the subjects. Other studies have already pinpointed such a\nlack of agreement [9], which, together with the results of the\npresent studies appears to refute the dogma of the existence of a\ncorrelation between hemispheric dominance for language and\nhandedness, and should lead to revisit models, including genetic\nones [32], attempting to explain this association [33].\n5. Incidence of atypical individuals and manual\npreference strength\nAnother key result of the present study is that occurrence of\natypical individuals, as assessed by the 2-category classification,\nwas found significantly correlated with strength of handedness. In\na previous study, Knecht et al. [5] described a link between\nhandedness and the occurrence of atypical individuals (defined as\nhaving negative left-minus-right laterality index as measured with\nfCTD during verb generation). Specifically, these authors reported\nan inverse relationship between MPS ranked on the same 7-level\nscale, and the incidence of atypical individuals across their entire\nstudy sample of both RH and LH. Although we observed a very\nsimilar relationship in terms of slope and intercept values (see\nsection 3.5 above) when considering the whole sample of\nindividuals, we demonstrated that this correlation 1- was present\nin LH but not in RH, and 2- vanished when Strongly-atypical\nindividuals were discarded.\nIn order to exclude a possible dependence of this finding on the\ncategory boundaries of the MPS7 rating scale, we conducted the\nsame analysis using a 3-level scale with almost the same number of\nindividuals in each category (MPS3). Again, a significant\nrelationship was found that vanished when the 10 Strongly-\natypical individuals were disregarded, calling for a different\ninterpretation of Knecht et al findings. First, one should note that\nTable 8.Contingency table of language hemispheric lateralization type by manual preference strength.\nLanguage lateralization type\nMPS3 Typical Ambilateral Strongly-atypical All\nStrong R 87 (0.29) 11 (0.037) 0 (0.00) 98 (0.33)\nModerate 90 (0.30) 9 (0.030) 1 (0.003) 100 (0.33)\nStrong L 73 (0.25) 17 (0.057) 9 (0.030) 99 (0.33)\nAll 250 (0.84) 37 (0.12) 10 (0.033) 297 (1.00)\nLanguage lateralization types were derived from Gaussian mixture modeling of the probability density function of hemispheric functional lateralization index measured\nwith fMRI.

Each cell contains the number of subjects and corresponding fraction of the total sample size in parentheses.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0101165.t008\nHandedness and Language Lateralization\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 13 June 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e101165\nthe first four levels of the MP7 scale included only LH, the fifth\nincluded a majority of LH, and the last two classes included RH\nonly (see Figure 3 of [5]). Because individual lateralization index\nvalues were not available from Knecht et al. report, we could not\ndirectly test whether discarding right hemisphere dominant\nindividuals from their sample would render non significant the\nassociation they reported. However, based on the results of the\ndistribution of lateralization index by MPS they reported, it is clear\nthat strongly-atypical individuals are present in their sample, and\nthat they are all LH and have stronger manual preference\nstrength. Therefore, the claimed linear relationship between\nmanual preference strength and occurrence of atypical individuals\nmay just reflect two subgroup effects hitherto described, namely 1-\nlarger MPS and HFLI in Strongly-atypicals as compared to\nAmbilateral LH, and 2-larger HFLI and MPS values in RH as\ncompared to atypical LH. As a matter of fact, in the present study,\nthere was no difference in MP strength or manual ability between\ntypical and Ambilateral RH, the MP strength of Ambilateral RH\nbeing even stronger than that of typical RH.\nConclusion\nThis study demonstrates that, except in a small sample of strong\nLH with rightward asymmetry, concordance of hemispheric\ndominance for hand and for language production occurs by\nchance. The present result thus questions the existence of a link\nbetween control of the hand and of language by the same\nhemisphere, while indicating that a rightward representation of\nlanguage, although rare, is a normal variant of language\nlateralization.\nSupporting Information\nTable S1 Raw data of the study sample.\n(XLSX)\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors are indebted to Isabelle Hesling for very helpful comments in\npreparing the manuscript, and to Nicolas Delcroix and Marie-Rene´e\nBoudou-Turbelin for their help in acquiring and processing the BIL&GIN\ndatabase.\nAuthor Contributions\nConceived and designed the experiments: BM LZ GJ FC MJ EM LP\nNTM.
