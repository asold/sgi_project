    "abstract": "In view of the fact that the statistical feature quantity of traditional partial discharge (PD) pattern recognition relies on expert experience and lacks certain generalization, this paper develops PD pattern recognition based on the convolutional neural network (cnn) and long-term short-term memory network (lstm). Firstly, we constructed the cnn-lstm PD pattern recognition model, which combines the advantages of cnn in mining local spatial information of the PD spectrum and the advantages of lstm in mining the PD spectrum time series feature information. Then, the transformer PD UHF (Ultra High Frequency) experiment was carried out. The performance of the constructed cnn-lstm pattern recognition network was tested by using different types of typical PD spectrums. Experimental results show that: (1) for the floating potential defects, the recognition rates of cnn-lstm and cnn are both 100%; (2) cnn-lstm has better recognition ability than cnn for metal protrusion defects, oil paper void defects, and surface discharge defects; and (3) cnn-lstm has better overall recognition accuracy than cnn and lstm.",
