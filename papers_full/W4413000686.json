    "abstract": "Understanding how AI influences employee emotions is becoming critical as organizations prepare for widespread AI agent deployment. While existing research has explored human-AI interactions in corporate settings, little is known about how employees emotionally navigate relationships with AI agents exhibiting distinct personality traits. This empirical study examines white-collar employees' emotional responses while interacting with three generative AI agents in a virtual workspace, revealing novel social dynamics enabled by AI technologies. Using qualitative methods and inductive analysis, our findings show that anthropomorphic AI agents evoke a broad spectrum of emotions, from connection and contentment to amusement and frustration, extending beyond those typically triggered by web-based AI agents. Notably, participants experienced new emotional subsets, including unique manifestations of relational assurance and perceived worthlessness, which introduces new emotional subcategories within established frameworks.Moreover, the visual embodiment of AI agents in virtual workspaces significantly shapes user expectations and satisfaction. While a more human-like appearance can enhance engagement, it also introduces risks—a mismatch between an AI's visual representation and its actual behavior can heighten disappointment if the AI fails to meet human-like expectations. As organizations integrate AI agents into the workplace, our findings provide key insights for designing effective human-AI interactions. We emphasize the importance of human-centered design approaches that foster, rather than hinder, employee engagement, ensuring AI contributes positively to corporate environments.",
