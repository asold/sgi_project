    "abstract": "Ensuring compliance with complex industry standards and regulations during the design and implementation phases of construction projects is a significant challenge in the building information modeling (BIM) domain. Traditional manual compliance checking methods are inefficient and error-prone, failing to meet modern engineering demands. Natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning methods have improved efficiency and accuracy in rule interpretation and compliance checking. However, these methods still require extensive manual feature engineering, large, annotated datasets, and significant computational resources. Large language models (LLMs) provide robust language understanding with minimal labeled data due to their pre-training and few-shot learning capabilities. However, their application in the AEC field is still limited by the need for fine-tuning for specific tasks, handling complex texts with nested clauses and conditional statements. This study introduces an innovative automated compliance checking framework that integrates LLM, deep learning models, and ontology knowledge models. The use of LLM is motivated by its few-shot learning capability, which significantly reduces the need for large, annotated datasets required by previous methods. Deep learning is employed to preliminarily classify regulatory texts, which further enhances the accuracy of structured information extraction by the LLM compared to directly feeding raw data into the LLM. This novel combination of deep learning and LLM significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of compliance checks by automating the processing of regulatory texts and reducing manual intervention. This approach is crucial for architects, engineers, project managers, and regulators, providing a scalable and adaptable solution for automated compliance in the construction industry with broad application prospects.",
