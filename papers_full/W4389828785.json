An evolutionary perspective on \nplanning requires identification of the associated cognitive \nunderpinnings as well as comparative assessments of future-\noriented behavior across the animal kingdom (Osvath and \nMartin-Ordas 2014). While prospective behavior has been \ndocumented across a wide range of taxa, particularly cor -\nvids and primates (Raby and Clayton 2009), debate persists \nabout the extent, flexibility, and mechanisms of these plan-\nning abilities in nonhumans (Redshaw and Bulley 2018).\nThe cognitive underpinnings of planning likely vary rela-\ntive to how far in advance planning occurs, as well as the \nTwenty-five years of primate research in the Ndoki Forest\n * Stephanie Musgrave \n smusgrave@miami.edu\n1 Department of Anthropology, University of Miami, P.O. \nBox 248106, Coral Gables, FL 33124-2005, USA\n2 Wildlife Conservation Society, Congo Program, \nB.P. 14537 Brazzaville, Republic of Congo\n3 Fisher Center for the Study and Conservation of Apes, \nLincoln Park Zoo, 2001 N.

From one perspec-\ntive, planning ability emerges exclusively from the episodic \ncognitive system (Tulving 1972). Episodic memory involves \nmentally revisiting specific past experiences, which enables \nprojection of oneself into, and thus appropriate handling \nof, future scenarios (Krause and Sanz 2019). Behavioral \nand electrophysiological measures suggest a wide range \nof species may be able to act on the basis of episodic or \n“episodic-like” memory (Crystal 2018). According to the \nBischof–Köehler (1985) hypothesis, true planning also \ninvolves “episodic foresight,” the ability to project oneself \ninto a future state where one’s needs or desires differ with \nthose currently present. Suddendorf and Corballis (1997) \nhypothesize that this package of abilities, termed “mental \ntime travel,” is unique to humans.\nThe primacy of the episodic cognitive system in govern-\ning future-oriented behavior is debated, however, and this \nsystem may not impact future planning in the same way \nacross individuals. For example, experiments requiring par-\nticipants to disengage from a current state (e.g., satiation on \na particular food) in order to plan for the future suggest that \nepisodic memory abilities in humans may in some cases vary \nnegatively with the ability to project to a future state of need. \nIndividuals who were most successful remembering small \ndetails of past events showed greater difficulty disengaging \nfrom their current state when planning for the future (Cheke \nand Clayton 2019). Myriad other cognitive components—\ne.g., semantic and working memory, inhibitory control—are \nlikely also involved in future-oriented behavior (Osvath and \nMartin-Ordas 2014; Suddendorf and Corballis 2007). In \naddition, the ability to imagine feeling differently than one \ndoes at present is not necessarily synonymous with the abil-\nity to mentally simulate a future action (Byrne et al. 2013). \nIncreasing the breadth and depth of research on future-ori-\nented behavior in nonhumans is essential for illuminating the \ndiversity of related cognitive abilities and the evolutionary \nbasis of such skills (Krause and Sanz 2019), as well as the \nenvironmental interactions that support the development and \nexpression of cognitive abilities, including planning (Boesch \n2022).\nTool behavior can potentially render aspects of animals’ \nthought processes more “visible” by increasing the salience \nof relevant abilities, including planning. For example, the \npreparation of raw materials to achieve particular end goals \ncan serve as a visible manifestation of anticipatory thought \n(Byrne et al. 2013). Further, examining tool behavior in liv-\ning animals is invaluable for inferring the role of planning \nand other cognitive capacities in the technologies of human \nancestors. Evidence for planning abilities has been docu-\nmented in captive and experimental conditions, where great \napes both save (Dufour and Sterck 2008; Mulcahy and Call \n2006; Osvath and Karvonen 2012; Osvath and Osvath 2008) \nand produce tools for future use, including manufacture of \nmultiple functional tools (Bräuer and Call 2015). Critics of \na planning interpretation suggest that these actions could \nresult from merely learned associations between objects \nand past rewards rather than true planning, and they fur -\nther highlight ways in which apes do not seem sensitive to \nthe specific future conditions they will encounter (Redshaw \nand Bulley 2018). For example, apes in the Bräuer and Call \n(2015) experiment produced fewer (on average fewer than \ntwo) than the optimal number of tools (at least eight) that \nwould be needed for a future task. Thus, there is still ample \nwork required to elucidate flexible planning capacities in \ngreat apes and to replicate positive findings (Redshaw et al. \n2018).\nCognitive abilities develop in association with envi-\nronmental experience, and so to understand planning, it is \nessential to examine relevant behaviors across populations \nliving in different ecological conditions (Rosati et al. 2014, \nBoesch 2020). In wild populations, individuals must care-\nfully manage energetic investment in foraging while con-\nsidering a multitude of variables. In the context of foraging \ntool use, planning could confer adaptive benefits if it helps \nmaximize energetic gains, for example, by reducing effort \nrequired to procure tools and facilitating efficient alignment \nto sophisticated tool forms (Sanz et al. 2009). As an indi-\ncator of planning, tool transport is illuminating because it \nsuggests that animals potentially anticipate a forthcoming \ntask and the appropriate requirements for executing it (Byrne \net al. 2013).\nAmong wild nonhuman primates, chimpanzees (Boesch \nand Boesch 1984a; Goodall 1964; McGrew 1974; Nishida \n1973; Sanz et al. 2004) and capuchins (Visalberghi et al. \n2015) have been documented selecting and/or manufactur -\ning tools in advance and transporting them to a tool site. At \nTaï, chimpanzees take multiple variables into account when \nselecting which hammers to use for nut cracking (Sirianni \net al. 2015). The chimpanzees prefer heavier hammers when \nthey are closer to anvils (which are at fixed locations), but \nthey switch to a “prefer lighter” criterion as the distance to \nthe anvil increases (Boesch 2022). Given that they exhibit \nthis flexible, conditional selection of tools even when the \nanvil to be used is out of view (Boesch and Boesch 1984a), \nthey may use memories of nut-cracking sites when preparing \nfor tool use (Sirianni et al. 2015).\nChimpanzees also transport perishable tools. In the con-\ntext of ant fishing at Mahale, for example, chimpanzees have \nbeen documented manufacturing tools in advance and then \ncarrying these to an ant-infested tree (Nishida 1973). Typi-\ncally, transport distances are short, as tools are manufac-\ntured from plants within close proximity to anting locations, \noften from branches of the tree in which the nest is located. \nHowever, on some occasions, chimpanzees transported \ntools over 10 m, with one transport event of approximately \n527Primates (2024) 65:525–539 \n1 3\n70 m (Nishida 1973). Several species of grasses and vines \nwith particularly useful dimensions and material properties \nwere always transported in advance to nests (Nishida and \nHiraiwa 1982). In termite gathering, chimpanzees may also \ngather raw material sources that are out of view of a termite \nnest (Almeida-Warren et al. 2017 ; Goodall 1964 ; Pascual-\nGarrido 2018). In the Issa Valley, Tanzania, for example, \nchimpanzees gathered plants up to 33 m from termite \nmounds, and over half of plant sources were at a distance of \n10 m or further from the nest, often out of view of the nest \n(Almeida-Warren et al. 2017). However, it is not necessarily \nclear whether chimpanzees encounter a termite nest and then \ndepart to gather materials, or whether they arrive with tools \nalready in their possession.\nCentral chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) \nemploy multiple, perishable tool sets—which involve \ntwo different tool types used sequentially to achieve a \ngoal (Brewer and McGrew 1990 )—to gather invertebrate \nresources such as termites, honey, and ants (Bermejo and \nIllera 1999; Boesch et al. 2009 ; Estienne et al. 2017 ; Fay \nand Carroll 1994; Sanz et al. 2004, 2010; Sanz and Mor -\ngan 2007, 2009). In the Goualougo Triangle, Republic of \nCongo, chimpanzees have been observed manufacturing and \nusing two distinct tool sets to gather termites of the genus \nMacrotermes from epigeal (above-ground) and subterranean \nnests. At epigeal nests, chimpanzees use their fingers or a \nperforating twig to open termite exit holes on the nest sur -\nface before inserting an herbaceous probe into the nest to \ntermite fish. In the subterranean setting, chimpanzees use a \nwoody puncturing stick to create a tunnel into underground \nnest chambers before using a fishing probe to extract ter -\nmites (Fig.  1). In both contexts, the chimpanzees fray the \nends of the smooth, pliable fishing probes to a brush tip. \nRather than resulting from a byproduct of use, the brush tip \nis an intentional modification that improves the efficiency of \nthe tool at gathering insects (Sanz et al. 2009). Durability is \na key difference between these tool types: herbaceous fishing \nprobes are more fragile and typically used during a single \nvisit, while the woody puncturing sticks can withstand many \nuses and last for weeks or months.\nGoualougo chimpanzees are highly selective for plant \nspecies chosen to manufacture some tool types, including \nfishing probes and puncturing sticks. They do not show such \nselectivity in selecting leaves to sponge water or branches \nto manufacture beehive pounding clubs (Sanz and Mor -\ngan 2007). Ninety-eight percent of puncturing sticks are \ntypically manufactured from Thomandersia hensii, which \nhas straight, rigid, and durable branches. While prevalent, \nT. hensii is not always available immediately near the ter -\nmite nest, and chimpanzees do gather materials from this \nspecies tens of meters away and out of visibility of the nest \n(Sanz et al. 2004; Sanz and Morgan 2007). More than 96% \nof fishing probes are manufactured from just one or two spe-\ncies of herb within the Marantaceae family. While Maran-\ntaceae is the dominant undergrowth, the particular species \npreferred by chimpanzees are not the most abundant (Sanz \nFig. 1  Tool sets to gather termites at epigeal (left) and subterranean \n(right) nests. A subadult male clears a termite exit hole with a per -\nforating twig a before using a fishing probe b to extract termites. An \nadult female tunnels into the earth with a woody puncturing stick c; \nthe brush-tip fibers are visible on the end of the fishing probe d she \nholds in her mouth\n528 Primates (2024) 65:525–539\n1 3\nand Morgan 2007). Within a 20 m radius of termite nests, \nthe closest preferred fishing probe material is on average at a \ndistance of 6.35 ± 5.33 m (Sanz and Morgan 2013). The raw \nmaterial requirements and the obligate use of tool sets for \ntermite gathering in comparison to the flexibility in materi-\nals used for leaf sponging and honey gathering in this popu-\nlation make it an ideal context in which to examine planning \nin great apes, as tool users may have to mentally represent \nmultiple, temporally separated future steps, each involving \nuse of tools that adhere to a different template (Byrne et al. \n2013; Martin-Ordas 2020). Previous research described 45 \ncases of chimpanzees arriving at termite mounds with fish-\ning probes and/or puncturing sticks, with chimpanzees more \noften transporting fishing probes (Sanz et al. 2004). Procure-\nment of other tool types has not been reported. In this study, \nwe examined more broadly what strategies chimpanzees use \nto procure tools for termite gathering, leaf sponging, and \nhoney gathering for individuals across the lifespan, to better \nassess the scope and development of their flexible planning \nabilities.\nWe hypothesized that chimpanzees planned for current \nneeds (i.e., hunger or desire for termites). Thus, we antici-\npated differences in the transport and use of the different \ntool types with respect to whether tools were brought to the \ntool site (termite nest, beehive, water basin), manufactured \nor acquired at the site after arrival, or transferred from oth-\ners. We also expected that chimpanzees would anticipate \nthe need for tools at future times, which would be evidenced \nby transporting multiple tool types for a sequential task. \nSpecifically in the termite-gathering context, we predicted \nthat there would be significant differences in how often the \nmore fragile fishing probes would be transported to nests \nand that they would be more often transported in multiples \ncompared to other tool types. The more durable puncturing \nsticks, in contrast, are conserved at nests between visits, and \nso chimpanzees were expected to transport them less often \nand rarely in multiples. Given that both a puncturing stick \nand a fishing probe must be used to gain access to termites at \nsubterranean nests, we anticipated that chimpanzees would \nat least sometimes transport this tool set, demonstrating \npreparation for both the first and subsequent stages of this \ntask. Unlike fishing probes and puncturing sticks, perforat-\ning twigs are not manufactured from specific raw materials \nand are not required at epigeal nests, and so transport of \nthis tool type was not anticipated. For beehive pounding, \nwe predicted that mature individuals would more frequently \ntransport tools than immature chimpanzees. Other types of \ntools used for honey gathering are not obligate, and so, like \nperforating twigs, may be gathered at the site as needed. We \nalso did not expect leaf sponging tools to be transported, as \nchimpanzees typically use any leaves available at the water \nbasin.\nPast studies on a range of tool-using taxa have docu -\nmented ontogenetic changes as well as sex differences in \ntool behavior (for example with respect to skill or fre-\nquency of tool use), but the influence of these variables \non tool procurement strategies has not previously been \ninvestigated in this context. Particularly for complex \ntool tasks, mastery of tool use and manufacture can take \nmany years. In the Goualougo Triangle, for example, all \nchimpanzees termite fish successfully by 2.9 years, but \nthey do not manufacture brush-tipped fishing probes until \nlater infancy or juvenility, at an average age of 4.3 years. \nDevelopment of the use of tool sets extends even further, \ninto adolescence (Musgrave, Lonsdorf, Morgan, and \nSanz, 2020). We thus predicted that mature compared \nwith immature chimpanzees would be more likely to plan \ntheir tool use, evidenced by them more frequently arriving \nwith tools to the sites where the tools will be used. Sex \ndifferences in frequency of adult tool use and/or use of \nparticular tool types are reported for chimpanzees (e.g., \nBoesch and Boesch 1984b; Goodall 1986; Pruetz and Ber -\ntolani 2007), captive bonobos (Boose et al. 2013; Gruber \net al. 2010), macaques (Gumert et al. 2011), and capuchins \n(e.g., Falótico and Ottoni 2014; Spagnoletti et al. 2011). \nIt is unclear, however, whether such differences extend to \nthe cognitive underpinnings of tool behaviors and if so, \nat what age such differences appear. Thus, we assessed \nwhether females and males differed in procurement strat-\negy. We also specifically examined whether adult females \nwith offspring more often transported multiple tools, given \npast observations that adult females sometimes transfer \ntools to their offspring over the course of termite-gathering \nsessions (Musgrave et al. 2016; Musgrave et al. 2020a, b).\nMaterials and methods\nStudy site and subjects\nChimpanzee observations were conducted in the \nGoualougo Triangle, located in the Nouabalé-Ndoki \nNational Park (N 2°05−3°03; E 16°51−16°56) in the \nRepublic of Congo.\nThe study site encompasses 380  km2 of evergreen and \nsemi-deciduous lowland forest; the altitude ranges from \n330 m to 600 m. There is a primary rainy season from \nAugust to November and a short rainy season in May.\nChimpanzees were identified based on unique individ-\nual characteristics, and age/sex class of chimpanzees was \nscored based on known birthdates as well as physiological \nand developmental criteria (Boesch and Boesch-Acher -\nmann 2000; Estienne et al. 2019; Goodall 1968, 1986; \nPlooij 1984). Tool procurement by known individuals \n529Primates (2024) 65:525–539 \n1 3\nwas observed across age/sex classes for termite gathering, \nhoney gathering, and leaf sponging (Table  1).\nData collection and reliability\nRemote video recording devices have been employed for \nsurveillance of chimpanzee presence at termite nests in \nthe Goualougo Triangle since 2003 (Sanz et al. 2004). A \ncomplete year of chimpanzee termite-gathering behavior at \nsubterranean, epigeal, and subterranean-epigeal nests was \nscreened, comprising approximately 25 h of video footage \nrecorded between April 2005 and May 2006. Thirty-seven \ntermite nests were also surveyed to determine the location of \nthe closest available raw materials for fishing probe manu-\nfacture. To broaden the comparison of tool types used by \nthis population, we screened video recordings from daily fol-\nlows of chimpanzees for tool use in honey gathering and leaf \nsponging. All video was screened and scored with INTER -\nACT software (Mangold 2021).\nEvery occurrence of a chimpanzee possessing a tool was \nrecorded. For each unique tool possessed by a chimpanzee, \nscored variables included termite nest type, tool type, how \nthe chimpanzee came to possess the tool (the tool “origin”, \nTable 2 and Additional file 1: Video S1), as well as whether \nthe tool was transported in multiples and/or as part of a tool \nset. Cohen’s κ was calculated between two independent \nobservers to ensure adequate interobserver reliability for \nkey variables (Landis and Koch 1977) before proceeding \nwith coding. Interobserver reliability for termite nest type \nwas κ  = 1.00; tool type (fishing probe, perforating twig, \npuncturing stick, no tool, not visible) κ = 0.87; and for tool \norigin (arrived, acquired, gathered and manufactured, trans-\nferred, unknown origin, no tool present, or origin not visible) \nκ = 0.71. Observers consulted on the final dataset to ensure \nconsensus in how observations were assigned (sensu Humle \nand Matsuzawa 2002).\nTo investigate whether procurement strategy varied \naccording to tool type for termite harvesting, Fisher’s exact \ntest was used to assess the association between the vari-\nables tool type and tool origin category. The sample sizes \nassociated with the other tool types precluded their inclu-\nsion in this analysis, and so these findings are reported \nusing descriptive statistics. We also report descriptive sta-\ntistics regarding transport of multiple tools and tool sets. \nChi-square tests were conducted to compare procurement \nTable 1  Number of unique individuals observed by age/sex class and \ntool context\n*Adult male: 15+ years old; adult female: 15+ years old or first offspring; \nsubadult: 10–15 years old; juvenile: 5–10 years; infant: 0–5 years\nAge class Sex Tool context\nTermite \ngathering\nHoney \ngathering\nLeaf sponging\nAdult* Male 21 1\nFemale 21 2 3\nSubadult Male 2 2\nFemale 5 1 2\nJuvenile Male 4 2 1\nFemale 11 2\nUnknown 1\nInfant Male 1\nFemale 1\nTotal per category 66 9 8\nTable 2  Tool origin category definitions\na See Musgrave et al. 2016, and Musgrave et al. 2020a, b, for further details\nTool origin category Definition\nArrived Chimpanzee brings tool to site where it will be used (termite nest, beehive, water basin).

When considering all tool \ntypes together, arrivals comprised the largest proportion \nof events (60.5%), followed by gathering and manufac-\nturing on site (18.4%), acquisition after arrival (15.7%), \nand transfer (5.3%). For termite-gathering tools specifi-\ncally, the largest proportion of procurement events was \ncomposed of arrivals (66.2%), followed by acquisition \nafter arrival (17.4%), gathering and manufacturing on site \n(11.0%), and transfer (5.4%). Transport of fishing probes \nwas documented for 190 events, constituting the vast \nmajority (96%) of the arrival events.\nThere was a significant association between termite-\ngathering tool type and tool origin category (Fisher’s exact \ntest, p < 2.2 ×  10−16). Chimpanzees more often arrived at \ntermite nests with fishing probes as opposed to procuring \nthese tools via another method (gathering and manufacture \non site, acquiring, or transfer). In contrast, chimpanzees \nwere more likely to acquire puncturing sticks after arrival \nat the nest, rather than procuring these tools via another \nstrategy. Chimpanzees did not arrive at epigeal nests with \npuncturing sticks, only arriving with this tool type at sub-\nterranean nests. Chimpanzees never arrived transporting \nperforating twigs; after arrival at the nest, they typically \nmanufactured these or picked up a suitable nearby twig \nwhen necessary (Fig.  2). On three occasions, chimpanzees \nperforated a termite exit hole by reversing the orientation \nof their fishing probe to use the unmodified end of the \ntool to clear the tunnel; the fishing probe thus served as a \nmultifunction tool.\nTransport of multiple tools and tool sets\nOf the 190 fishing probes transported to termite nests, \n17 (8.9%) arrived as multiples. Six different individuals \ntransported multiple fishing probes, and multiple transport \noccurred during visits to both epigeal (n = 3 visits) and sub-\nterranean (n = 4) nests. The transport of multiple puncturing \nsticks was rare, documented on only one occasion. Chim-\npanzees were not observed to transport multiple beehive \npounding clubs, other honey gathering tools, or leaf sponges.\nAs predicted, chimpanzees occasionally transported a \npuncturing stick plus a fishing probe to subterranean nests \n(n = 7 events). There were no instances of tool sets being \ntransported to epigeal nests. These chimpanzees have been \nobserved to use tool sets in honey gathering (Sanz and Mor-\ngan 2009), but pounding clubs and other tools used in honey \ngathering were not transported simultaneously.\nVariation in procurement strategy according to age \nand sex\nTool origin category proportions varied by age (Table  3). \nMature chimpanzees (adults and subadults) transported a \ngreater proportion of their tools to tool sites than did other \nFig. 2  Tool origin varied \naccording to tool type. Chim-\npanzees usually transported \nfishing probes to nests, while \npuncturing sticks were most \noften acquired after arrival. \nPerforating twigs were never \ntransported in advance; instead, \nchimpanzees picked up or made \nthese tools once at the nest\n\n532 Primates (2024) 65:525–539\n1 3\nage classes. Juveniles arrived only with fishing probes and \n(on one occasion) a beehive pounding club and overall \nexhibited more diverse tool procurement strategies. Infants \nwere never observed arriving with any tool type.\nFor fishing probes specifically, there was a significant \ndifference between mature and immature chimpanzees \nwith respect to whether or not chimpanzees arrived with \nthis tool type (χ 2(1, n = 237) = 16.87, p < 0.0001). Arriv-\nals comprised 85.1% of events (n  = 160/188) for mature \nchimpanzees and 60.9% of events (n  = 28/46) for juvenile \nchimpanzees. Mature and juvenile chimpanzees gathered \nand manufactured probes in similar proportions, but mature \nchimpanzees acquired these tools via transfer for only 1.6% \nof events (n  = 3/188), compared with 17.4% (n  = 8/46) for \njuveniles (Fig.  3). Only mature chimpanzees were docu-\nmented transporting puncturing sticks to termite nests. \nAcquiring these tools at the nest after arrival was the most \ncommon strategy for both subadults and adults, with this cat-\negory comprising 60.5% of events (n  = 23/38). Most obser-\nvations (88.9%) of perforating tool use involved adults, who \neither gathered and manufactured (n = 7/16 events, 43.8%) or \npicked up (n = 9/16 events, 56.3%) a perforating twig. There \nwas one occurrence each of perforating twig manufacture \nby a juvenile and an older infant. Pounding of beehives was \nalso primarily an adult activity, whereas use of other tools \nin honey gathering was most common among juveniles who \ngathered and manufactured these tools at the hive. We most \noften observed leaf sponging among subadults and adults, \nwho gathered leaves that were within arm’s reach of the \nwater basin to manufacture a sponge.\nTool origin category proportions were similar between \nmature males and females across tool types, though females \narrived with the majority (n = 5/6 events) of beehive pound-\ning clubs (Table  4). No significant sex differences were \ndetected in the tendency to transport fishing probes to nests \n(χ2(1, n = 185) = 0.5, p = 0.48). Arriving with a fishing probe \nwas the most common procurement strategy for both mature \nfemales (n  = 93/107 events, 86.9%) and males (n  = 64/78 \nevents, 82.1%). Females and males also showed similar pat-\nterns for puncturing sticks and perforating twigs, with both \nsexes most often acquiring puncturing sticks on site and pro-\ncuring perforating twigs by a combination of acquiring after \narrival or manufacturing on site. For fishing probes, arrivals \nconstituted n = 14/27 events (51.9%) for immature females \nand n = 4/8 events (50%) for immature males. All uses of \npuncturing (n = 3 events) and perforating (n = 2 events) tools \namong immature chimpanzees of known sex were by juve-\nnile females. Both females and males exclusively gathered \nand manufactured leaf sponges on site.\nAs a group, adult females with dependent offspring \narrived with termite-gathering tools (70.1% of events) at a \nsimilar proportion as did subadult and adult females without \ndependent offspring (75.0% of events). Similarity remained \nbetween the two groups when examining only fishing probes \n(85.7% versus 93%). However, a seemingly practical dif-\nference was that adult females with multiple immature \noffspring always arrived with their fishing probes (n  = 10 \nevents), as opposed to procuring them via other means.\nAvailability of raw material for tool types \nthat reflect selectivity\nBotanical surveys at termite nests showed that the nearest \nstand of suitable herbs was > 20 m for 4/37 nests surveyed. \nFig. 3  Fishing probe origin \nvaried across age classes. While \nadults, subadults, and juveniles \nmost often arrived with fishing \nprobes, this strategy was signifi-\ncantly more likely for mature \n(adult and subadult) compared \nwith immature (juvenile and \ninfant) chimpanzees. Juveniles’ \nprocurement strategy was more \ndiverse, most notably with a \ngreater proportion of these tools \nprocured via transfer\n\n533Primates (2024) 65:525–539 \n1 3\nChimpanzees do not always use the closest available herbs, \nhowever. For example, for 21 of those 37 nests, the closest \nsuitable raw materials did not show evidence of being used \nby chimpanzees, despite clear evidence of recent termite-\ngathering at the nest.\nDiscussion\nThis research examined chimpanzee tool procurement \nbehavior in the context of termite gathering at subterra-\nnean and epigeal termite nests, honey gathering, and leaf \nsponging. In both termite-gathering contexts, chimpanzees \nmust solve a sequential challenge, but important differences \nbetween termite nest types and across tool types provide \ninsights into whether and how chimpanzees plan their tool \nuse. Tool procurement strategies varied depending on tool \ntype and sometimes involved transport of multiples and tool \nsets, suggesting that chimpanzees flexibly planned for com-\nplex, sequential tool tasks. In contrast to the termite-gath-\nering context, chimpanzees’ more flexible choice of materi-\nals for honey gathering and leaf sponging highlights links \nbetween raw material selectivity and procurement strategy, \nas chimpanzees did not often transport tools to these the \nsites where the tools will be used. We also documented that \nmature and immature chimpanzees exhibited differences in \ntool procurement strategies, indicating likely developmental \ncorrelates of tool use planning.\nConsistent with what would be expected if tool use is \nplanned, chimpanzees always arrived with tools specific to \nthe termite nest type visited. For both subterranean and epi-\ngeal nests, a fishing probe is required to extract termites, \nand chimpanzees transported these to both termite nest \ntypes. Subterranean nests further necessitate the use of a \npuncturing stick before a fishing probe, and chimpanzees \nsometimes transported a puncturing stick in addition to a \nfishing probe to this termite nest type. It is noteworthy that \nchimpanzees did not arrive to subterranean nests transport-\ning only a puncturing stick; this tool type on its own cannot \nfacilitate successful termite gathering (Sanz et al. 2004). Nor \ndid chimpanzees ever transport puncturing sticks to epigeal \nnests. These observations indicate that chimpanzees plan \nnot only to gather termites, but to visit a particular type of \ntermite nest (Byrne et al. 2013).\nChimpanzees also transported the different tool types in \nvarying relative frequencies. Individuals most often gath-\nered and manufactured fishing probes prior to arriving at \nthe nest, and they did so significantly more often for fish-\ning probes than for puncturing sticks. Given that chimpan-\nzees source particular materials from the landscape to make \nfishing probes (Sanz and Morgan 2007), gathering the raw \nmaterials for these tools en route is likely more efficient than \ntraveling to a termite nest and then leaving to search for \nTable 4  Number and proportion \nof events per tool origin \ncategory and sex for mature \nchimpanzees, by tool type\nTool origin\nArrived Gathered and \nmanufactured\nAcquired Transferred Total \nno. of \ntools\nFishing probe\n Females 93 (86.9%) 6 (5.6%) 7 (6.5%) 1 (0.9%) 107\n Males 64 (82.1%) 9 (11.5%) 3 (3.8%) 2 (2.6%) 78\nPuncturing stick\n Females 4 (22.2%) 1 (5.6%) 11 (61.1%) 2 (11.1%) 18\n Males 4 (20.0%) 1 (5.0%) 12 (60.0%) 3 (15.0%) 20\nPerforating twig\n Females 0 5 (50%) 5 (50%) 0 10\n Males 0 2 (33.3%) 4 (66.7%) 0 6\nBeehive pound\n Females 5 (83.3%) 1 (16.7%) 0 0 6\n Males 0 1 (100%) 0 0 1\nOther honey gathering tool\n Females 0 1 (100%) 0 0 1\n Males 0 1 (100%) 0 0 1\nLeaf sponge\n Females 0 6 (100%) 0 0 6\n Males 0 6 (100%) 0 0 6\nTotal per category 170 40 42 8 260\n534 Primates (2024) 65:525–539\n1 3\nthe desired materials if they are not found growing in the \nimmediate vicinity of the termite nest. Herb stems degrade \nquickly, so experienced termite fishers rarely pick up and \nreuse discarded fishing probes. The fragility of the brush tip \nmay also prompt chimpanzees to at least occasionally trans-\nport multiple probes, in anticipation that one herb stem will \nprove insufficient for the duration of a termite fishing bout. \nWhile chimpanzees are also selective for materials used to \nmake puncturing sticks, these woody tools are more durable \nthan fishing probes, and they are conserved at subterranean \nnests for weeks or months (Sanz et al. 2004). The larger pro-\nportion of these tools procured via acquisition after arrival \nsuggests that chimpanzees likely anticipate that that they can \nacquire and reuse puncturing sticks at subterranean nests. \nIn contrast to both of these tool types, perforating twigs are \nonly optionally used at termite nests, and various woody raw \nmaterials found in abundance are suitable for reopening the \nexit holes on the nest surface. Accordingly, chimpanzees \nnever arrived with perforating twigs. Future research could \nexplicitly quantify woody materials to further assess this \ninterpretation, but the ease and rapidity with which chimpan-\nzees source twigs suggest that source materials are consist-\nently plentiful (e.g., Additional file 2: Video S2).\nSuitable leaf-sponging materials also appear to be abun-\ndant, as chimpanzees gathered and manufactured these tools \nrather than transporting them in advance or acquiring them \non site (Fig.  4). The opportunistic nature of leaf sponging, \ngiven that a water basin is likely more ephemeral than a \ntermite nest, and the fragility of leaf sponges that precludes \nretaining them between visits, may also help account for dif-\nferences across tasks. In the honey gathering context (Fig. 5), \nthe balance of observations between the categories of arrival \nand gather and manufacture could reflect similar dynamics \nas well as the heterogeneous nature of beehives (Sanz and \nMorgan 2009), such that it is difficult for chimpanzees to \nanticipate precisely what form of tool will be best suited for \ngaining access to a hive. All of our observations of honey \ngathering and leaf sponging occurred in an arboreal environ-\nment, which likely also reduces opportunities for tools to be \nretained at tool sites and acquired after arrival. Increasing \nterrestriality during the Pliocene (Foley and Gamble 2009) is \nhypothesized to have facilitated acceleration of technologi-\ncal complexity among hominins, one reason for which could \nhave been the enhanced opportunity to encounter others’ \ndiscarded tools (Meulman et al. 2012). Future research could \ncompare how such constructed niches (Sanz et al. 2019) vary \nacross terrestrial and arboreal settings.\nIn combination with other supporting evidence, the pre-\nsent data suggest that rather than routinely collecting and \ntransporting tools in case an encounter with a termite nest \noccurs, or gathering tools only after encountering a termite \nnest, chimpanzees plan to visit a particular nest and thus \nprocure the relevant tools efficiently, when they intend to \nuse them. Planning for multiple tool use in this context could \nprovide several advantages, including more efficient produc-\ntion of tools in adherence to a mental template of tool form. \nWhile transporting perishable tools is not as energetically \ncostly as carrying nut-cracking hammers, for example, small \nimprovements in efficiency of termite gathering may be non-\ntrivial, especially given that termite-fishing sessions may be \nbrief—on average, sessions last 6.05 ± 2.55 min (Sanz and \nMorgan 2013). In addition, in a social group, arriving with \ntools or with multiple tools could prevent an individual from \nbeing displaced from a site after leaving to gather materials, \nand mothers may avoid having to leave or retrieve infants \nwhen coming and going to gather raw material.\nWhile in the present study we have classified our observa-\ntions as minimally representing a case of planning for cur -\nrent needs (e.g., hunger), we emphasize that this planning \nmay encompass anticipation of multiple future, sequential \nstages of a task. It is also possible that chimpanzees antici-\npate the need for tools at future times, even if they do not \nimmediately intend to termite fish (i.e., the “spoon test,” \nSuddendorf and Corballis 1997; Tulving 2005). For exam-\nple, chimpanzees at Goualougo have been observed to con-\nserve termite-gathering tools during rest periods (Krause \nand Sanz 2019). In captivity, apes can save tools for use \nat later times (e.g., > 14 h wait, Mulcahy and Call 2006). \nTogether, these findings suggest that chimpanzees can pre-\npare for tool use over flexible time scales. Such flexibility \nis likely adaptive, given that the choice to use tools and the \nassociated decisions regarding tool procurement may need \nto include dynamic evaluation of multiple ecological and \nsocial variables. For example, chimpanzees must efficiently \nlocate and track availability of ripe fruit, which is widely \nand heterogeneously distributed on the landscape (Ghiglieri \nFig. 4  A juvenile male uses a leaf sponge to gather water from a tree \nbasin. For this arboreal tool task, chimpanzees gather leaves from \nwithin arm’s reach of a water basin, without preference for specific \nplant species. Photo credit: Kyle de Nobrega, Goualougo Triangle \nApe Project, Wildlife Conservation Society\n535Primates (2024) 65:525–539 \n1 3\n1984); they must also monitor the location of conspecifics, \nincluding potentially hostile individuals from other commu-\nnities (Wilson et al. 2014).\nContinued research may help to illustrate aspects of \nthis decision making, for example, by quantifying how far \nchimpanzees typically travel between other resource types \n(e.g., fruit or leaves) and termite nests or how chimpanzee \nvisitation to specific locations in the forest relates to nearby \nresource availability (e.g., Janmaat et al. 2016) or to the \nranging of conspecifics or other species, including other apes \n(e.g., Sanz et al. 2022). A full understanding of potential \nplanning behavior requires consideration of these comple-\nmentary abilities. In addition to spatial knowledge of one’s \nhome range, understanding of tool functional properties \nlikely also supports efficient identification of tool material \nand manufacture of tools. In captive experiments, all great \nape species tested can differentiate functional and nonfunc-\ntional tools (Hermann et al. 2008), but continued examina-\ntion of both interspecific (e.g., Visalberghi et al. 2015) and \nintraspecific (e.g. Boesch 2022) variation in the ability to \nselect and transform raw materials is necessary to further \nclarify the flexibility underlying these behaviors, what spe-\ncific physical properties are prioritized by tool makers, and \nhow individuals acquire these skills (Musgrave and Sanz \n2019).\nAn important methodological limitation of the present \nstudy is that due to the limited field of view of camera traps \nused to record termite-gathering activity, the complete \nbehavioral sequence of gathering raw material, manufactur-\ning a tool, and transporting the tool in this context is often \nnot captured. As a result, it is not necessarily possible to \ninfer the distance over which the tool was transported or to \nconfirm whether the chimpanzee saw the termite nest prior \nto gathering raw materials. In some cases, however, cam-\nera traps do preserve such details, including instances of \ntransport where the termite nest is not visible through the \nunderstory from where the chimpanzee comes into view (see \nAdditional file 1: Video S1). Even when transport distance \ncannot be quantified, however, several lines of supporting \nevidence support the interpretation that tool manufacture \nand subsequent termite gathering are not simply prompted \nby seeing a termite nest. Observations of navigational behav-\nior and use of “shortcuts” suggest the ability to exploit spe-\ncific locations on the landscape (e.g., efficient deviations \nto arrive at ant-infested trees, Nishida and Hiraiwa 1982). \nIn addition, chimpanzees at Goualougo have been directly \nobserved procuring tool materials in several tool contexts \nFig. 5  An adult female with a clinging infant transports a beehive \npounding club to an arboreal beehive. In the present study, most \nobservations of beehive pounding club transport were documented \namong mature females.

Further, they routinely visit mul-\ntiple termite nests in close proximity (but out of view from \neach other) on the same day (unpublished data). Such per -\nsistence is a hallmark of intentionality (e.g., Leavens et al. \n2005), suggesting pursuit of an overarching goal. It is cer -\ntainly possible, that individuals sometimes decide to termite \ngather at the moment that they encounter a suitable location. \nAltogether, however, multiple lines of evidence support the \ninterpretation that chimpanzees routinely plan to gather ter-\nmites and that at least sometimes, they prepare accordingly \nen route to the nest.\nThe limitations of the present study nonetheless suggest \nimportant avenues forward. Using direct or remote video \nobservations in conjunction with measurements of retrieved \ntools could help to confirm the extent to which chimpan-\nzees plan or adapt tools for the unique demands of particular \nnests (Sanz et al. 2014). Combining behavioral observations \nwith insights from primate archaeology (Almeida-Warren \net al. 2017; Carvalho and Almeida-Warren 2019; Haslam \net al. 2017) will also provide expanded insights into tool \nprocurement strategies and planning (Musgrave and Sanz \n2021). For example, chimpanzees did occasionally arrive to \nsubterranean nests with the complete tool set, comprising a \npuncturing stick and fishing probe.\nNonhuman apes are sometimes considered unable to \ngauge the certainty of their own memories (Suddendorf and \nRedshaw 2017). However, one potential explanation for \noccasional preparation of multiple tools is that chimpanzees \naccount for their own uncertainty about the assemblage at a \ngiven location. Quantifying relevant variables such as time \nsince an individual last visited, existing count of puncturing \nsticks present, availability of nearby suitable raw materials, \nand number of individuals in visiting party could help to \nfurther illuminate what contingencies guide decisions about \ntransport of multiple tools and tool sets.\nIn addition to arriving with tool sets, chimpanzees some-\ntimes arrived with multiple fishing probes. Mothers with \nmultiple offspring always transported their tools in advance, \nand one adult female who arrived with her infant daughter \ntransported three fishing probes to the termite nest. This \nfemale has been documented transferring fishing probes and \npuncturing sticks to her offspring on numerous occasions \n(Musgrave et al. 2016; Musgrave et al. 2020a, b). Chim-\npanzees with dependents may further anticipate transfers \nof these tools. Indeed, mature compared with immature \nindividuals were more likely to transport tools in advance, \nwhile procuring tools via transfer occurred more often for \nimmature compared with mature chimpanzees.\nThere were no general sex differences detected among \nadults in tendency to transport tools or multiple fishing \nprobes, and experienced termite fishers of both sexes are \nlikely aware of the potential fragility of fishing probes. \nEspecially for lightweight termite-fishing tools, the mod-\nest sexual dimorphism in chimpanzee body size is unlikely \nto influence decisions regarding tool transport. Overall, we \nhave observed that adult and subadult females are more \nengaged in honey gathering than males in the Goualougo \nTriangle (Sanz and Morgan 2009). Thus, it was not surpris-\ning that most of our observations of the transport of beehive \npounding clubs were also by mature females. During daily \nfollows, we also noticed that females revisited particular bee-\nhives over both shorter (days) and longer time scales (years), \nwhich could have influenced their decision to transport tools. \nWhether sexual dimorphism affects chimpanzees’ tool pro-\ncurement strategies in this or other contexts, such as hammer \nselection during percussive tool use, is not yet known. In \nbearded capuchins (Sapajus libidinosus), a highly sexually \ndimorphic species, median distances of hammer transport \nto crack encased foods appear similar between sexes. Thus, \nboth males and females recognize and prefer heavier ham-\nmers despite the greater cost of transport for smaller-bodied \nindividuals (Visalberghi et al. 2015). Rather than resulting \nfrom a clear single factor such as sexual dimorphism or cog-\nnitive differences, sex differences in chimpanzee tool use, \nincluding differences in procurement and planning, likely \nreflect complex interactions of multiple factors (e.g., physi-\nological, socioecological, and developmental) depending on \ntool context, as well as individual differences.\nThe more limited evidence for planning behavior \nobserved in immature chimpanzees could reflect cogni-\ntive limitations; in human children, robust future think -\ning is posited to develop only after the age of 4–5 years \n(Martin-Ordas 2020). Another possibility is that growing \nspatial independence influences tool procurement among \nyounger chimpanzees. Infants, who travel on their mother, \nmay be unlikely to dismount to independently gather raw \nmaterial en route to a nest. That arrivals comprised 61% \nof procurement events for juvenile chimpanzees suggests \nthat older dependents, however, are taking a more active \nrole in preparing for tool use. Juvenile arrival events took \nseveral different forms, for example, juveniles locomoting \nindependently yet arriving with a mature chimpanzee(s), \nusually their mothers, with both chimpanzees transport-\ning fishing probes; juveniles, typically close to sub-\nadulthood, visiting a termite nest alone and transporting \na fishing probe; and juveniles arriving with their mother, \nwith only the juvenile transporting a fishing probe. These \nobservations suggest that older dependents may take cues \nfrom mothers or other older individuals who are gather -\ning raw materials but may also be influencing travel and \ntool use decisions. Future studies could further investigate \nmother–offspring communication and travel interactions in \nthese contexts as they intersect with planning for tool use \nand other activities.\n537Primates (2024) 65:525–539 \n1 3\nOngoing research on how primates prepare for tool use \nwill be essential for improving inferences regarding the \nscope and time depth of planning among human ancestors. \nEarly hominins likely gathered tool materials and manufac-\ntured tools in advance of use (e.g., Braun et al. 2008), which \nmay have enabled more efficient procurement and use of raw \nmaterials (Delagnes and Roche 2005). Planning could have \nconferred additional energy-saving benefits when tool mak-\ners sought specific raw materials. This selectivity is inferred \nwhen the prevalence of particular materials in archaeologi-\ncal assemblages exceeds their abundance on the landscape \nrelative to other possible materials (Harmand 2009; Stout \net al. 2005). Inferences based on this evidence, however, are \ncomplicated by time-averaging of the archaeological record \n(Luncz et al. 2016). Further study of flexible planning in liv-\ning taxa closely related to humans is thus essential for recon-\nstructing the evolutionary origins of these skills (Krause and \nSanz 2019).\nFlexibility is a key component of why future-oriented \ncognition is adaptive, with clear potential benefits in a \nrange of contexts (e.g., Janmaat et al. 2014; van Schaik \net al. 2013), including tool use and foraging. Increasing \nevidence suggests that planning capacities have likely con-\nvergently evolved across a range of distantly related taxa \n(Boeckle et al. 2020). Continued research will be essential \nfor illuminating how planning skills develop over the lifes-\npan and how planning behavior might vary between sexes \nor individuals or depend on specific task characteristics \n(e.g., energetic demands of tool transport, access to others \ntools in particular contexts, increased likelihood of success \nwith tool sources from particular materials). Integrating \nbehavioral, spatial, and archaeological data on tool use \nare important future steps for comparative study across \ntaxa and to improve inferences about the decision-making \nprocesses and time depth of planning associated with the \ntechnologies of human ancestors.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplemen-\ntary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s10329- 023- 01106-4.\nAcknowledgements This research would not have been possible with-\nout the continued support of the Ministère de l’Economie Forestière du \ngouvernement de la République du Congo and the Agence Congolaise \nde la Faune et des Aires Protégées (ACFAP).
