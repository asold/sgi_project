INTRODUCTION\nThe day-by-day increase in the global energy demand and\nthe constraints on fossil fuels-based generation have encour-\naged worldwide nations to adopt more renewable distributed\ngenerations (DGs) into the electricity grids. However, the\ndirect connection of DGs to the power grids may cause neg-\native power quality impacts [1] including harmonic injection\nand voltage ﬂuctuation. Microgrids are gaining more and\nmore attention because of their high reliability and ﬂex-\nibility, which can provide a more effective way for DGs\nconnection to distribution networks [2]. Based on the form\nof electric energy, microgrids can be categorized into DC,\nAC and AC/DC hybrid microgrids. DC and AC microgrids\ncan only provide single form of electricity. On the other hand,\nAC/DC hybrid microgrid can better satisfy the demand of\ndistributed renewable energy resources (DRER) access and\nthe continuous increase of the DC loads [3], [4]. Meanwhile,\nmultiform and high-reliable power grid has become essential\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Shihong Ding\n.\nto satisfy the demands of power consumers, which is difﬁ-\ncult to achieve through traditional distribution networks [5].\nIn order to tackle the above objectives, the concept of energy\nrouter (ER) is proposed in the recent literatures [6]–[8].\nSolid-state transformer (SST), also known as power elec-\ntronic transformer (PET), not only has the same functions\nof traditional power transformer, but also can perform the\nfollowing tasks:\n1. Realizing electrical isolation and power transmission;\n2. Providing a variety of power interface;\n3. Realizing ﬂexible operation of AC/DC hybrid system;\n4. Improving node autonomy in distribution networks.\nA comprehensive overview on SST is presented in [1], [2]\nincluding concepts, topologies, classiﬁcation, power convert-\ners, material selection, and key aspects for design criteria and\ncontrol schemes. Topology and control of household energy\nrouters based on direct AC/AC power electronic transformer\nis proposed in [3]. While this approach can increase the power\ndensity and reliability of the device to some extent, it does\nnot comprise a DC link, which calls for additional converters\nfor DC loads. An overview of control strategies and power\nVOLUME 10, 2022 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Quet al.: Energy Management Strategy of AC/DC Hybrid Microgrid Based on Solid-State Transformer\nmanagement schemes for hybrid AC/DC microgrid is pro-\nposed in [4]. A new method to control the power and DC bus\nvoltage is proposed in [5], but the control of AC bus is not\nconsidered. A DC bus voltage droop control strategy based on\nSST and energy storage unit is presented in [8]. Conventional\ndroop control, which mimics the behavior of a synchronous\ngenerator in the power systems to modulate active and reac-\ntive powers by respectively regulating the frequency and\nvoltage magnitude, is widely utilized to coordinate parallel\ninverters. The droop coefﬁcients are usually determined by\nthe maximum allowed frequency and voltage deviation along\nwith the rated power capacity of each DG. In conventional\ndroop control, the droop coefﬁcient is ﬁxed. Adaptive droop\ncontrol method is proposed in [9]–[12] to facilitate dynamic\nchange to the droop coefﬁcient based on the variations of\nsystem operation conditions such as DG power generation,\nstate of charge (SOC) of battery storage units or changes of\nadaptive proportion-integral (PI) control parameters. How-\never, the electricity price (EP), which is a key parameter,\nis neglected in the proposed adaptive droop control design\nin the above-mentioned references. To satisfy the power con-\nsumers in ER-based low-voltage distribution networks and to\nachieve maximum economic beneﬁts, EP should be consid-\nered. A novel active power control strategy for the converters\nbased on the bidirectional droop characteristic is proposed\nin [13]–[15] to realize power balance and independent power\nsharing. But the proposed converter to connect the DC and\nthe AC microgrids is a conventional AC/DC bidirectional\nconverter that does not comprise the multiple functions of the\nSST. For the energy management strategy of hybrid energy\nsystems, references [16], [17] propose the utilization of fuzzy\nlogic to achieve multi-control objectives. SST is the core\npiece of equipment for building future ER and ﬂexible dis-\ntribution power systems [10], [11].\nThe above discussion show that most of the existing\nresearch have focused on developing some speciﬁc micro-\ngrids and SST topologies [18] and new power devices and\nmodulation strategies [19]. However, not much attention has\nbeen given to energy management strategies for SST within\nAC/DC hybrid microgrids. Therefore, the main contribution\nof this paper can be summarized as follows:\n1. The structure of an AC/DC hybrid microgrid based on\nSST is presented, and the control coordination strategy of\neach part is developed.\n2. In contrary to the ﬁxed droop coefﬁcient in conven-\ntional droop control systems, a novel adaptive droop control\napproach is proposed in this paper.\n3. An energy management strategy is proposed to prolong\nthe life of supercapacitors and optimize economic beneﬁts for\npower consumers.\nThe remaining sections of the paper are organized as\nbelow:\nSection II introduces the structure of SST and the con-\ntrol method of its components. The structure and control\nof each sub-unit of the hybrid AC-DC microgrid are pre-\nsented in section III. Section IV presents the proposed energy\nmanagement strategy of the AC/DC hybrid microgrid based\non SST. Simulation results are presented in section V while\nthe key conclusions are drawn in section VI.\nII. SST STRUCTURE AND CONTROL\nThe SST consists of a cascaded H-bridge (CHB) AC/DC\nrectiﬁer, a dual active bridge (DAB) converter with a high\nfrequency transformer and a DC/AC inverter as shown in\nFig. 1.\nA. CONTROL OF THE RECTIFIER STAGE\nRectiﬁer stage, also known as the input stage, consists of three\ncascaded H-bridges with a DC bus reference voltage of 4kV .\nThe state equations of the rectiﬁer can be written as:\n\n\n\nLs\ndis\ndt =3Uhdcd −Us −Rsis\nC1\ndUhdc\ndt =−di s −Uhdc\nRL\n(1)\nwhere, is is the input side current, Us is the input voltage, Rs\nis the input line resistance, Ls is the input inductor, Uhdc is\nthe DC bus voltage, C1 is the rectiﬁer DC bus capacitor, d is\nthe rectiﬁer pulse width modulation (PWM) duty cycle. RL is\nequivalent load resistance of cascaded modules.\nThe single-phase d-q vector control is used in the rectiﬁer\ncontrol. First an imaginary phase which is 90 degree lagging\nthe original phase is hypothesized. There are various methods\nto obtain the imaginary phase, such as: delay method, all-pass\nﬁlter method (APF), and second-order generalized integrator\n(SOGI). Comparing the performance of APF, SOGI and the\ndelay method, the APF response is found to be faster, so the\nAPF method is adopted in this paper to obtain the imaginary\nphase. The transfer function G(s) of the APF in s-domain is\nas follows:\nG (s)=ω−s\nω+s (2)\nwhere, ω=2πf is the angular frequency in rad/sec.\nThe relationship between the imaginary phase and the\noriginal phase (current and voltage) in α-β reference frame\nis given by (3) and (4).\n{\niα =is =Is cos(ωt)\niβ =Is sin(ωt) (3)\n{\nUα =Us =\n√\n2U cos(ωt)\nUβ =\n√\n2U sin(ωt) (4)\nThe single-phase d-q transformation as given by (5) is\napplied to (3) and (4), to derive the d-q differential equations\nof the single-phase H-bridge rectiﬁer as given by (6).\n[x]dq =[T ] [x]αβ (5)\n20634 VOLUME 10, 2022\nZ.

The active current reference i∗\nsd\nis adjusted by the voltage loop PI controller according to\nthe voltage error between the input-stage DC-link capacitor\nvoltage reference Udc−ref and the average value Udc−ave of all\ninput-stage DC-link capacitor voltages. For DC-link voltage\nbalancing problem, a voltage equalization controller is used.\nDetailed modeling of this controller can be found in [8].\nB. CONTROL OF THE DAB\nThe dual active bridge consists of a high voltage H-Bridge,\na high frequency transformer (HFT) and a low voltage\nH-bridge.

CONTROL OF THE INVERTER STAGE\nIn the inverter stage, also known as the output stage, the DC\nlink voltage is regulated by the DAB converter while the\nPWM AC inverter controls the magnitude of the output side\nAC voltage. The inverter controller has an inner current loop\nand an outer voltage loop as shown in Fig. 5. A proportional-\nresonant (PR) controller is used to guarantee high tracking\nperformance.\nFIGURE 5.

Topology and control of the PV DC/DC converter.\nA maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control algorithm\nemploys the improved variable step perturb and observation\n(P&O) method [20]. The working principle is based on the\nslope of the P–V curve of the PV panel. The operating voltage\nis perturbed depending on the nature of the slope to track the\nmaximum power point.\nB. ENERGY STORAGE BIDIRECTIONAL DC/DC CONVERTER\nEnergy storage (ES) devices are used for balancing the power\nin grid-connected mode and can support the regular operation\nof the AC/DC hybrid microgrid in islanded mode. Due to the\nintermittency of renewable energy sources, ES has become\nessential for microgrids of DGs. In this paper, a bidirectional\nbuck-boost converter [21] is used as the charging and dis-\ncharging circuit for the ES device and the supercapacitor,\nwhich is a fast charging/discharging device. There are dif-\nferent control objectives for ES system in grid-connected and\nislanded modes, and the bidirectional power ﬂow is achieved\nby controlling the ES inductor voltage. Topology and control\nof the ES are shown in Fig. 7.\nFIGURE 7. Topology and control of ES.\n20636 VOLUME 10, 2022\nZ. Quet al.: Energy Management Strategy of AC/DC Hybrid Microgrid Based on Solid-State Transformer\nIn grid-connected mode, an adaptive droop control is\nproposed in this paper. The droop coefﬁcient is obtained\nthrough energy management strategy. Closed-loop control\nof the ES inductor current is employed, and the ES charg-\ning/discharging current reference value is obtained by the\ndroop control. The voltage-current droop characteristic of the\nES system is shown in Fig. 8.\nFIGURE 8. Voltage-current droop characteristic of the ES system.\nIn Fig. 8, mES is the initial droop coefﬁcient, IESmax\nand -I ESmax are the maximum values of the supercapacitor\ndischarge and charge currents, respectively; with a range of\n[−30A,30A]. UL1 and UH1 are action thresholds, which are\nset to reduce the frequency of supercapacitor charging and\ndischarging and to improve supercapacitor life and system\nefﬁciency. Usually, the DC bus voltage is 750V when the\nsupercapacitor has no output power. When the bus voltage\nreaches its minimum value, the supercapacitor generates a\nmaximum current, which is the 30A in this study. Based on\nthese two points, the droop slope can be determined.\nIn islanded mode, ES system replaces the grid-connected\npart to maintain the low voltage DC bus at rated value and\nthe controller includes the outer DC voltage loop and inner\nES inductor current loop as shown in Fig. 7.\nIV. ENERGY MANAGEMENT STRATEGY\nIn this section, the power ﬂows in the grid-connected mode is\ndiscussed, and an energy management strategy for the grid-\nconnected mode is proposed.\nFIGURE 9. Power flows in grid-connected mode.\nThe possible power ﬂows of SST in grid-connected mode\nare as shown in Fig. 9. Thus, the active power balance\nequation in grid-connected mode can be expressed as:\nPDG +PG +PES −Pload =0 (11)\nwhere, PG is the grid side power, PES is the ES power, Pload is\nthe DC and AC load power, PDG is the distributed generation,\nincluding PPV and PAC.\nTaking Pnet = PDG −Pload as the net output power\nof the hybrid AC/DC microgrid; If Pnet < 0, the ES and\ndistribution network are required to compensate the deﬁcient\npower. On the other hand, if Pnet > 0, there exists surplus\npower to charge the supercapacitor and inﬂow the distribution\nnetwork. Equation (11) can be simpliﬁed as:\nPnet +PG +PES =0 (12)\nIn islanding mode, PG =0, so the power balance equation\ncan then be expressed as:\nPnet +PES =0 (13)\nFrom the above power ﬂow situation, in the grid connected\nmode, the power ﬂow between the distribution network,\nES and hybrid AC/DC microgrid is required when Pnet ̸=0.\nPower distribution problems can occur, and if power distri-\nbution is not satisfactory, supercapacitor life and economy of\nconsumers can be affected. Therefore, it is necessary to set a\nreliable energy management strategy to distribute electricity\nrationally.\nAn energy management strategy is proposed in this paper,\nwhich considers the impact of SOC capacity for superca-\npacitor life and the impact of electricity price for economic\ncustomers. The strategy can smoothen the ﬂuctuations of\nrenewable energy output power and load demand.\nAccording to the above discussion, the regulation of the\ndroop coefﬁcient will depend on three factors: SOC, EP and\nPnet. It is suitable to use fuzzy control for the energy man-\nagement strategy with multiple control objectives that are\nmutually restrictive. A fuzzy logic control (FLC) is based\non fuzzy-logic thinking in the design of how a controller\nworks. The fuzzy logic is meant to establish a buffer zone\nbetween the traditional zero and one, with logic segments of\nnone-zero and none-one possibility. Therefore, a FLC is used\nto realize the novel adaptive droop control proposed in this\npaper. EP and Pnet can be expressed by unit-time electricity\ncharge ECunit. To ease the calculation, a normalized method\nis used to map EP and −PES −Pnet to the range [0, 1], then\nECunit can be expressed as:\nECunit = EP −EPmin\nEPmax −EPmin\n×PN −PES −Pnet\n2PN\n(14)\nwhere, EP is the real-time electricity price, EPmax and EPmin\nare the maximum and lowest values of electricity price,\nrespectively.\nIn the proposed FLC, SOC and ECunit are set as the two\ninput variables, while mES is set as the output variable. The\nVOLUME 10, 2022 20637\nZ. Quet al.: Energy Management Strategy of AC/DC Hybrid Microgrid Based on Solid-State Transformer\ncentroid method is utilized for defuzziﬁcation of fuzzy num-\nbers. The ranges of SOC, ECunit are set as in (15).\n{\nSOC ∈[40%,80%]\nECunit ∈[0,1] (15)\nIt should be noted that 40% is greater than the minimum\nallowable threshold of SOC to ensure sufﬁcient remaining\ncapacity of ES to maintain the regular operation of the AC/DC\nhybrid microgrid when switching to islanded mode. The input\nand output membership functions of the FLC contain ﬁve\ngrades as shown in Fig. 10. Five grades are employed to\ndescribe the input and output variables: L (low), SL (slightly\nlow), M (medium), SH (slightly high), H (high).\nFIGURE 10. Membership functions of the input and output variables.\nTABLE 1. Fuzzy rules of discharge.\nTables 1 and 2 show the fuzzy control rules, which are\ndesigned according to the following criteria:\n1) When SOC is high, the supercapacitor is charged with\nthe lowest current. When SOC is low, the supercapacitor is\ndischarged with the lowest current.\n2) When ECunit is high, the power transmission from the\nSST to the distribution grid is encouraged. When ECunit is\nlow, the power transmission from the distribution grid into\nthe SST is encouraged.\nTABLE 2. Fuzzy rules of charge.\n3) When Pnet >0, priority is given to deliver surplus power\nto the distribution grid for economic beneﬁt.\n4) When Pnet <0, the priority is given to supply power by\nES to reduce customers’ electricity bills.\nV. SIMULATION RESULTS\nIn this section, the performance of the proposed energy man-\nagement strategy is assessed through simulation analysis.\nThe main parameters of the simulation model are listed in\nTable 3. The simulation analysis assumed two scenarios for\nthe studied model: system with surplus power and system\nwith power deﬁciency.\nTABLE 3. Simulation parameters.\nIn case of surplus power, Table 4 shows the power varia-\ntions within each module. Figs. 11 and 12 show the voltage\nand power variations of each unit within the hybrid microgrid.\nIt can be seen that before t = 0.5s, the PV output power\nis 10kW, DC load power demand is 10kW, AC DG output\npower is 20kW, AC load power demand is 20kW. Initially,\nthe DC bus voltage rapidly rises and stabilizes at 750V and\n20638 VOLUME 10, 2022\nZ.

Voltage and power variation profile of each unit in the DC\nmicrogrid.\nthe AC frequency is set at 50Hz, because the load demand and\nthe power provided by the DGs are equal. Within the period\nt =0.5s and t =1s, the DC load is reduced to 5kW and\nthe AC load is reduced to 10kW. The power provided by the\nDGs is too much, and the distribution grid and energy storage\nsystem are needed to absorb the surplus energy. Within this\nperiod, the DC bus voltage raises rapidly and stabilizes at\n765V due to the reduced DC load.\nBetween t = 1s and t = 1.5s, the DG output power\nincreases to 30kW and the DC bus voltage rises to 775V .\nThe following conclusions can be obtained from the power\ndistribution after two-time changes of load power: with dif-\nferent Pnet, the power distribution ratios of energy storage and\ndistribution network are different. This is because the energy\nmanagement strategy proposed in this paper gets different\nFIGURE 12. Voltage and power variation profile of each unit in the AC\nmicrogrid.\ndroop coefﬁcients with different Pnet, which makes the power\ndistribution of both not set at a ﬁxed value to achieve optimal\npower distribution. At time t =1.5s, the EP changes from\n0.3 to 0.9. With the rise of EP, the power absorbed by the\nES is decreasing while the power delivered to the distribution\nnetwork is increasing. This indicates that when the electricity\nprice is getting high, the surplus power is delivered to the\ndistribution network as a priority to gain economic beneﬁts\nto the consumers.\nIn the case of Power deﬁciency, Table 5 shows the power\nvariations of each module. Figs. 13 and 14 show the voltage\nand power proﬁles of each unit within the hybrid microgrid.\nBefore t =0.5s, Balance is maintained within the AC/DC\nhybrid microgrid. Within the period t =0.5s and t =1s, the\nDC load is increased to 15kW and the AC load is increased\nto 30kW. Within this period, ES and distribution network\nare needed to provide the required power; Pnet =−15kW.\nThrough the energy management system, the energy provided\nVOLUME 10, 2022 20639\nZ.

Power variations in Case of deficiency power.\nWithin the period t = 1 −1.5s, the DC load is raised\nto 25kW while the AC load remains unchanged, Pnet =\n−25kW, the electricity price does not change at this time. The\npower provided by the two parts is: 14kW, 11kW. Since the\nelectricity price is very high, EP =0.9, the power provided\nby the ES has been greater than the power provided by the\ndistribution network in order to reduce the electricity costs\nfor customers. At time t = 1.5s, the EP changes from\n0.9 to 0.3. As such, the power provided by the distribution\ngrid and energy storage is changed because of the lower EP.\nThe power provided by the distribution network becomes\nhigher, 17kW, while the power provided by the ES becomes\nlower, 8kW. This is because lower EP allows more power to\nFIGURE 14. Voltage and power variation profile of each unit in the AC\nmicrogrid.\nbe obtained from the distribution grid, while avoiding over-\ndischarging the supercapacitor which causes severe impacts\nto its operational life.\nFig. 15 shows a comparison of the performance of the\nproposed novel adaptive droop control and the conventional\ndroop control in terms of the ES charge and discharge power.\nIt can be observed that before t =0.5s there is no power\nﬂow in the ES unit because the power is kept balance among\nall sub-units during this period. Within the period 0.5-1s,\ncompared with conventional control, the proposed control\napproach in this paper exhibits less power during charging\nand more power when discharging. During the period 1-1.5s,\nthe proposed adaptive droop control can better regulate the\npower variation and prolong supercapacitor life upon changes\nin Pnet. During the period t =1.5s and t =2s, with the\nchange of the EP, input or output power of the ES is reduced\nto improve economic beneﬁts of power consumers. On the\n20640 VOLUME 10, 2022\nZ.

Comparison of the proposed and traditional control\napproaches.\nother hand, the conventional droop control does not change\nwith the change of the EP. The simulation results shown in\nFig. 15 validate the effectiveness of the energy management\nstrategy and the adaptive droop control approach proposed in\nthis paper.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nThe structure of an AC/DC hybrid microgrid based on SST\nis presented in this paper. An energy management strategy is\nproposed to resolve the issues of the ﬁxed droop coefﬁcient\ncurrently adopted in the conventional droop control systems.\nWith such static coefﬁcient, the power distribution cannot\nchange with the change of the system operating conditions\nsuch as intermittency of renewable energy sources. A novel\nadaptive droop control method is proposed for the ES system\nto prolong supercapacitor operational life, and enhance the\neconomic beneﬁts of power consumers. The feasibility of the\nproposed energy management strategy is veriﬁed through in-\ndepth simulation analysis. Compared with the conventional\ndroop control system, simulation results reveal that the pro-\nposed controller comprises superior performance in power\ndistribution optimization.\nREFERENCES\n[1] M.
