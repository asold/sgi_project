    "abstract": "In this paper, a novel algorithm for PD localization in power transformers based on wavelet de-noising technique and energy criterion is proposed. Partial discharge is one of the main failures in power transformers. The localization of which could be very useful for maintenance systems. Acoustic signals due to a PD event are transient, irregular and non-repetitive. So wavelet transform is an efficient tool for this signal processing problem that gives a time-frequency demonstration. First, different wavelet based de-noising methods are analyzed. Then, a reasonable structure for threshold value determining and applying manner on signals is presented. Evaluated errors are good evidences for choices. Next, applying the elimination low energy frequency bands is discussed and developed as a de-noising method. Time differences between signals are used for PD localization. Different ways in time arrival detection are introduced and a novel approach in energy criterion method is presented. At the end, the quality of algorithm is verified through the different assays in lab.",
