  "abstract": "The research on the temperature field of the transformer winding under dynamic variable load is of great significance for ensuring the safe operation of power systems. This paper takes an SSP-360000/500 transformer as the research object, establishes a 2-D simulation model, and uses the finite volume method to analyze the high voltage winding and low voltage winding temperature distribution of the transformer under dynamic variable load. The simulation calculation results have been fully verified by the experimental data to make the successful prediction of the overall temperature and hot spot temperature position of forced oil circulation transformers with a guided structure. The results show that the most significant temperature raise occurs at the secondary end of the winding. In the case of dynamic variable load. The temperature raise of the winding becomes larger as the load increases, but before the rated load is in the stable temperature rise range, it can run safely for a long time. However, during overload operation, the average temperature raise of the high voltage winding may exceed its limit, the insulation material is damaged.",
