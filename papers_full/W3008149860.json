  "abstract": "In determining the severity of power transformer faults, several approaches have been previously proposed; however, most published studies do not accommodate gas level, gas rate, and Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) interpretation in a single approach. To increase the reliability of the faults’ severity assessment of power transformers, a novel approach in the form of fuzzy logic has been proposed as a new solution to determine faults’ severity using the combination of gas level, gas rate, and DGA interpretation from the Duval Pentagon Method (DPM). A four-level typical concentration and rate were established based on the local population. To simplify the assessment of hundreds of power transformer data, a Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based DPM with high agreements to the graphical DPM has been developed. The proposed approach has been implemented to 448 power transformers and further implementation was done to evaluate faults’ severity of power transformers from historical DGA data. This new approach yields in high agreement with the previous methods, but with better sensitivity due to the incorporation of gas level, gas rate, and DGA interpretation results in one approach.",
