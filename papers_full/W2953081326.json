These providers include physicians, nurses, and mostly\nprimary care centres and hospitals. Usually these payments depend on dimensions\nincluded in contracts celebrated between the payer (e.g. the State) and the payee (the\nprovider). Several schemes are available: (a) block budget, featured by a periodic\nprospective payment associated with the activity, (b) capitation, based on the\nnumber of enrolled patients, multiplied by a unitary price, (c) case-based payments,\nsuch that health care providers are paid a prospective/retrospective lump sum per\nepisode of care, and (d) fee for service, characterized by the payment of a price per\nmedical act in a retrospective way. Advantages and disadvantages of these schemes\ncan be found in the relevant literature (e.g. Marshall et al. 2014; Friesner and\nRosenman 2009; Street et al. 2011).\nIt is important to stress that resources, namely the ﬁnancial ones, are scarcer each\npassing day, motivating an optimization exercise to better allocate them. To the best\nof our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst attempt to optimize payments to the health care\nproviders. A common feature of all payment schemes is the paid price or tariff,\nwhich is usually set as the average cost per patient/medical act/episode of care. We\nremark that health care is a public interest service and, as such, resources allocation\nand payments should account not only for the efﬁciency of providers but also for\ntheir quality and access (Ferreira and Marques 2018b). Despite some contracts\ncontain a number of quality and access parameters to be fulﬁlled, in most of the\ncases penalties are not sufﬁcient to induce good practices. Instead of ﬁxing these\nparameters (quality, access) and hoping that providers do not adopt misconducts, we\nshould ﬁnd out a reference set of providers for each health care provider. Such a\nreference set should contain only those entities whose quality and access\nobservations are above a pre-deﬁned threshold that indicates a minimum accept-\nable level of social performance. This intends to avoid that poor quality providers\ncan be potential benchmarks. Additionally, optimal allocation of resources requires\nfair comparisons in terms of internal and external operational environment\n(Karagiannis and Velentzas 2012; Cordero et al. 2018). Efﬁciency of health care\nproviders is dependent on epidemiology and demographics as well as on their\nspecialization degree (Ferreira et al. 2017), hence disregarding these dimensions\nfrom the payment optimization is likely to produce biased results. Hence, we restrict\neven more the aforementioned reference set using operational environment\nvariables such that the reference set contains the entities with good quality and\naccess levels and, simultaneously, operate under similar conditions as the provider\nwhose payment we want to optimize. The construction of this reference set\nconstitutes a bridge between operational research and health economics/manage-\nment, which appears to be innovative in the ﬁeld.\nOnce the reference set has been constructed, we should use a benchmarking tool\nto derive an efﬁciency frontier, where benchmarks are placed. It is usual to construct\na common frontier by using the entire set of health care providers. But since we\nwant neither unfair comparisons nor potential benchmarks with poor quality, we use\n123\n2102 D. C. Ferreira et al.\nthe reference set to construct such a frontier. Because each provider has its own\ncomparability set, it is difﬁcult to parametrically deﬁne a frontier shape equal for all\nproviders and expect good outcomes, including ﬁtting parameters. Therefore, the\nfrontier should be empirically constructed, i.e. based only on inputs, outputs, and the\nreference set that is ﬁxed as the overall comparability set for each provider. Data\nEnvelopment Analysis (DEA) (Charnes et al. 1979; Banker et al. 1984) is probably\nthe most common method to reach this goal. Because of the frontier convexity,\nDEA-based efﬁciency levels can be sometimes underestimated, meaning that inputs\n(outputs) should be decreased (increased) beyond what they would if there was not\nthat bias. Indeed, nonconvexity is usually a more natural assumption for the frontier.\nThe extreme case corresponds to (FDH) (Deprins et al. 1984; Daraio and Simar\n2007), although it assumes that each provider can have one and only one\nbenchmark. Nevertheless, we believe that such an assumption is too restrictive but\nstill we should keep nonconvexity. In view of that, we extend the work of Banker\nand Maindiratta ( 1986) and construct a log-linear piecewise frontier with a\ndirectional nature. Properties of this model are studied, including the existence of\nmultiple solutions. By consequence, we propose an extension of that model that\nresults from the work of Sueyoshi and Sekitani ( 2009) and mitigates the\naforementioned problem. Moreover, in some circumstances, the log-linear program\nmay become infeasible; thus, we propose a slightly change on the model to cope\nwith this problem. Based on the optimized parameters resulting from the log-linear\nprogramming tool, we can derive optimal payments as well as potential cost savings\nrelated to the achieved tariffs. These are innovations in operational research.\nThe structure of the manuscript is as follows. Section 2 presents some useful\nconcepts and deﬁnitions. Section 3 details and explores the new best practice tariff-\nbased tool (the core of this study). Section 4 related efﬁciency, optimal payments,\nand cost savings for the commissioner. Section 5 applies the new tool to the\nPortuguese public hospitals. Section 6 provides some concluding remarks and\nexplains the economic impact of this tool to the Portuguese National Health Service.\n2 Useful concepts and definitions\n2.1 Overview\nDeﬁning optimal payments due to the health care providers depends on a number of\ndistinct features. 1 The ﬁrst one is the level of care, service, or Diagnostic Related\nGroups (DRG) under analysis. Each country or health care service pays for clinical\nacts on different levels, e.g. directly to the physician or to the nurse, per service\n(inpatients, outpatients, surgeries, ... ), per speciality, per diagnosis group, and per\nseverity level of each diagnosis group. The concept of DRG, for instance, has long\nbeen accepted by health care management researchers as a way of accounting for\nthe patient-mix, which is to say a measure of heterogeneity among the patients\n1 Henceforward, we will use the term ’hospital’ to denote the health care provider. Though, this does not\nmean that our approach cannot be used to optimize payments to other health care providers, such as\nphysicians. This is only a matter of simpliﬁcation.\n123\nPay for performance in health care: a new best practice... 2103\nadmitted to the hospital services. Researchers have analysed the efﬁciency and\nproductivity of hospitals based on such a concept. For instance, recently\nJohannessen et al. ( 2017) considered some DRG scores resulting from hospitaliza-\ntion, day-care, and outpatient consultations, so as to investigate the productivity\nimprovement following a Norwegian hospital reform. Some references cited therein\nalso considered DRG to homogenize the hospital activity.\nThe second feature is the set of variables used to establish such a payment (or\ntariff) and to avoid that it results from unfair comparisons and/or from benchmarks\nthat disregarded important dimensions for citizens, such as quality and access.\nHence, we need inputs (traditionally deﬁned as the operational expenses required to\ntreat patients), outputs (the quantity of treated patients), operational environment\n(which can be internal and/or external to the hospital), and quality (which also\nincludes access). It is important to point out that, in our framework, quality is\nassumed to positively contribute to the hospital overall performance. In other words,\nfrom two quality observations, the largest one presents a higher utility to the\nhospital. However, in some cases, quality is measured through undesirable\ndimensions (e.g. avoidable mortality in low severity levels), demanding for an\nappropriate rescaling. It is not the goal of our paper, although an example is given in\nthe next section.\nAlthough DEA and models alike have been extensively utilized with DRG\naltogether, to the best of our knowledge, no other study has previously employed\nthem to optimize payments in the health sector, particularly in DRG-based ﬁnancing\nsystems. This study can, then, be seen as a ﬁrst step in order to optimize those\npayments, making them fairer and more sustainable, with adjustments for quality\nand operational environment.\nThe idea underlying the use of quality and operational environment-based\ndimensions is to construct comparability sets for each health care provider. Such\nsets should contain only those observations that are close to the provider whose\ntariff (payment) we want to optimize. Closeness (or proximity) is ﬁxed by the so-\ncalled bandwidth. At this point, the comparability set associated with quality\ndimensions are formulated in a distinct way because, differently from size and\nenvironment, the higher the quality of potential benchmarks (best practices), the\nbetter. In fact, given a certain health care provider, if there is, at least, another entity\ndelivering better health care with fewer resources per patient, then it should be a\npotential benchmark for the former one. Health care is a public interest service with\nseveral stakeholders, including citizens, staff, and the Government (either central or\nnot). They usually have a minimum level of quality that is acceptable to a provider\nbe considered a good performer. Because in our framework poor performers cannot\nbe benchmarks, we impose a threshold that is deﬁned as that minimum\nacceptable level per quality dimension.\n2.2 Notation\nIn this paper, we have adopted the following notation:\n123\n2104 D.

Such measures are the so-called\nbandwidths. The larger the bandwidth, the broader the set of hospitals accepted\nas comparable with the hospital k, whose optimal payment we want to assess. In\nview of that, optimal bandwidths are paramount.\nThe choice of optimal bandwidths, b\nkð‘Þ\ny ; bkð‘Þ\nqr , and bkð‘Þ\nzc , can be debatable since\nthere is a number of ways to compute a bandwidth. All of those ways present\nadvantages but also shortcomings. Particularly, a bandwidth can be either global or\nlocal. A bandwidth is global if it is the same across the whole sample of hospitals;\notherwise, it is local.\nOn the one hand, global bandwidths can easily be computed by using, for\ninstance, the Silverman’s rule of thumb. Let f denote a probability density function.\nWe usually plug-in f by a kernel with order c [ 0. Hence, the global bandwidth\nrelated to a variable V, whose observations in X have standard deviation ^rV ,i s\n(Silverman 1986):\nbV ¼2^rV J/C01=ð2cþ1Þ\nﬃﬃﬃpp ðc!Þ3 Rþ1\n/C01 f 2ðuÞdu\n2cð2cÞ!\nRþ1\n/C01u2f ðuÞdu\n/C16/C17 2\n0\nB@\n1\nCA\n1=ð2cþ1Þ\n: ð1Þ\nAccording to Ferreira et al. ( 2017), we should use kernel functions with compact\nsupport, i.e., f ðuÞ[ 0i f juj6 1 and f ðuÞ¼ 0 otherwise, and symmetric around k,\ni.e. c should be equal to 2 to avoid negative parts on f. In that case, the bandwidth\nsimpliﬁes to bV ¼2^rV\nﬃﬃpp Rþ1\n/C01\nf 2ðuÞdu\n6J\nRþ1\n/C01\nu2f ðuÞdu\n/C16/C17 2\n0\nB@\n1\nCA\n1=5\n. For example, if the triweight kernel\nis used, we have bV /C253:62^rV J/C01=5. The smaller and the more heterogeneous the\nsample, the larger the bandwidth.\nOn the other hand, local bandwidths can be obtained e.g. through the so-called k-\nNearest Neighbor method (Daraio and Simar 2007). First, one deﬁnes a grid of N\nunits, say N 2½/C15 1J;/C15 2J/C138, with 0 \\/C15 1 6 /C15 2 6 1. Then, one ﬁnds the value of N within\nsuch range that minimises the score function CV(N). For the case of bandwidth bkð‘Þ\nqr ,\nthe CV function is as follows:\n123\nPay for performance in health care: a new best practice... 2107\nCVðNÞ¼ 1\nJ\nXJ\ni¼1\nlog 1\nðJ /C01Þbkð‘Þ\nqr\nXJ\nj¼1;j6¼i\nf qjð‘Þ\nrð‘Þ /C0qið‘Þ\nrð‘Þ\nbkð‘Þ\nqr\n ! !\n;‘ 2W; rð‘Þ2Cð‘Þ; ð2Þ\nwhere f denotes a univariate kernel function. Therefore, bkð‘Þ\nqr is the local bandwidth\nassociated with hospital k chosen such that there are N points verifying\njqjð‘Þ\nrð‘Þ /C0qið‘Þ\nrð‘Þj6 bkð‘Þ\nqr ; rð‘Þ2Cð‘Þ. Naturally, we can specify similar local bandwidths\nfor the case of the output and the operational environment data. There are other\nalternatives for the local bandwidths’ formulation, including the (data-driven) least\nsquares cross validation procedure to minimise the integrated squared error (Ba ˇdin\net al. 2010; Hall et al. 2004; Li and Racine 2007).\n2.4.2 Comparability sets\nThe idea underlying our approach is to restrict the original set of hospitals X based\non constraints related to size (because of potential economies of scale), quality,\naccess, and environment. To simplify the exposition, we will assume that access\ndimensions can be included into the group of quality variables and handled like\nthem. Therefore, we may introduce three comparability sets that are subsets of X.\nThe ﬁrst comparability set presented regards the size of the health care provider.\nIt is important to guarantee that best practices related to hospital k have similar\noperations’ scale as this one. For that reason, we constrain the set of admissible best\npractices for k by using the concept of bandwidth and centring the observations\nassociated with that comparability set on y\nkð‘Þ, which is assumed to be the proxy for\nthe size of k.\nDeﬁnition 1 (Size-related comparability set , Xkð‘Þ\ny ) Given a service or DRG ‘ 2W,\nthe size-related comparability set for hospital k 2X is deﬁned as the set of hospitals\nwhose sizes, as measured by the output level Yð‘Þ, are close to the dimension of\nhospital k, i.e., ykð‘Þ. Let the bandwidth bkð‘Þ\ny be the closeness measure. Hence, Xkð‘Þ\ny\nis as follows:\nXkð‘Þ\ny ¼\n[\nj2X\ns.t. ykð‘Þ/C0bkð‘Þ\ny 6 yjð‘Þ6 ykð‘Þþbkð‘Þ\ny\n()\n: ð3Þ\nIn the following deﬁnition, we introduce the so-called quality-related compara-\nbility set, which, as before, requires a bandwidth. However, it also needs a user\npredeﬁned threshold per quality measure so as to ensure that no unit with low levels\nof quality (including access to health care services) can be addressed as a potential\nbest practice for the hospital k whose optimal payment is being computed. In fact,\nwe could achieve lower levels of resources consumption at the cost of reducing the\nquality of supplied services, endangering the societal mission of health care\nproviders. In practice, we would be interested on best practices that would\n123\n2108 D. C. Ferreira et al.\noutperform k in terms of both quality and access, i.e. verifying qjð‘Þ\nrð‘Þ > qkð‘Þ\nrð‘Þ for any\nrð‘Þ¼1; ... ; Rð‘Þ. Nonetheless, we note that hospitals with very high quality levels\nmay sometimes be technically inefﬁcient on resources consumption for the quantity\nof services delivered. It means that, if hospital k reaches the maximum quality\nwithin the dataset, then, according to our previous two conditions, no other hospital\ncould be a benchmark for k even if it would be more technically efﬁcient than the\nlatter. This constitutes a problem because the optimal payment for k would not be\nPareto-efﬁcient, jeopardising the health system sustainability. In practice, usually\none can reduce a little the quality levels of k by using bandwidths, if it results on\nmeaningful cost savings and as long as the best practices found for k would present\nquality levels at least above the user-deﬁned threshold.\nDeﬁnition 2 (Quality-related comparability set , X\nkð‘Þ\nq ) Given a service or DRG\n‘ 2W, the quality-related comparability set for hospital k 2X is deﬁned as the set\nof hospitals whose quality dimensions Qð‘Þ are close to the quality observed for\nhospital k (or even above it), qkð‘Þ\nrð‘Þ , and simultaneously larger than the user-deﬁned\nthreshold tð‘Þ\nqr for all rð‘Þ2Cð‘Þ;‘ 2W. Let the bandwidth bkð‘Þ\nqr be the closeness\nmeasure. Hence, Xkð‘Þ\nq is as follows:\nXkð‘Þ\nq ¼\n[\nj2X\ns.t.\nðqkð‘Þ\nrð‘Þ /C0bkð‘Þ\nqr 6 qjð‘Þ\nrð‘Þ 6 qkð‘Þ\nrð‘Þ þbkð‘Þ\nqr Þ_ðqjð‘Þ\nrð‘Þ > qkð‘Þ\nrð‘Þ Þ; rð‘Þ¼1; ... ; Rð‘Þ\n^\nðqjð‘Þ\nrð‘Þ > tð‘Þ\nqr Þ; rð‘Þ¼1; ... ; Rð‘Þ\n8\n><\n>:\n9\n>=\n>;\n:\nð4Þ\nThe deﬁnition of an environment-related comparability set is similar to the one\nassociated with size (vide supra).\nDeﬁnition 3 (Environment-related comparability set , Xkð‘Þ\nz ) Given a service or\nDRG ‘ 2W, the environment-related comparability set for hospital k 2X is deﬁned\nas the set of hospitals whose environment Zð‘Þ are close to the conditions observed\nfor hospital k, zkð‘Þ\ncð‘Þ , for all cð‘Þ2Uð‘Þ;‘ 2W. Let the bandwidth bkð‘Þ\nzc be the\ncloseness measure. Hence, Xkð‘Þ\nz is as follows:\nXkð‘Þ\nz ¼\n[\nj2X\ns.t. zkð‘Þ\ncð‘Þ /C0bkð‘Þ\nzc 6 zjð‘Þ\ncð‘Þ 6 zkð‘Þ\ncð‘Þ þbkð‘Þ\nzc ; cð‘Þ¼1; ... ; Cð‘Þ\n()\n: ð5Þ\nUsing these three deﬁnitions, we can construct the overall comparability set,\nXkð‘Þ, which is a subset of X.\n123\nPay for performance in health care: a new best practice... 2109\nDeﬁnition 4 (Overall comparability set , Xkð‘Þ) The overall comparability set\nrelated to service/DRG ‘ 2W and the hospital k 2X, results from the intersection\nof the three previously deﬁned comparability sets:\nXkð‘Þ¼Xkð‘Þ\ny \\Xkð‘Þ\nq \\Xkð‘Þ\nz : ð6Þ\nFigure 1 exempliﬁes the achievement of the overall comparability set associated\nwith the hospital k ¼4 as well as the corresponding comparability sets. In this\nexample, there are ﬁfteen hospital in the dataset; they could be potential best\npractices for k if features like size, quality, and environment would be disregarded.\nHowever, we have considered one quality and another environment dimensions. Let\nthe blue and the green areas (left) deﬁne the the size- and the environment-related\ncomparability sets for k ¼4, respectively. The intersection between them will result\non a subset composed of the following hospitals: X\nkð‘Þ\ny \\Xkð‘Þ\nz ¼f3; 4; 7; 14; 15g.\nThe red line (right) identiﬁed the user-deﬁned threshold. Arrows explain that the\nquality of potential best practices should be larger than or equal to 30. However, the\nquality observed for hospital k is equal to 70 and the bandwidth is 22, meaning that\nthe quality of those best practices for hospital k should, in fact, be larger than 48.\nAccordingly, we have Xkð‘Þ\ny \\Xkð‘Þ\nq ¼f1; 4; 7; 15gand Xkð‘Þ¼f4; 7; 15g. There-\nfore, the set of potential best practices related to k is composed of itself and of two\nmore hospitals: 7 and 15. In the next subsection we will explain how the best\npractice tariff of k can be obtained from Xkð‘Þ. To do so, we have to introduce the\nfollowing notation:\nFig. 1 On deﬁning the overall comparability set and its subsets (color ﬁgure online)\n123\n2110 D. C. Ferreira et al.\n• Jk is the length of the list Xkð‘Þ;\n• Xkð‘Þ;‘ 2W; is the vector of total operational expenses associated with the Jk\nhospitals in Xkð‘Þ;\n• Ykð‘Þ;‘ 2W; is the vector of total in/outpatients handled by the Jk hospitals in\nXkð‘Þ.\nIn the previous example, Jk ¼3, Xkð‘Þ¼ðx4ð‘Þ; x7ð‘Þ; x15ð‘ÞÞ>, and\nYkð‘Þ¼ðy4ð‘Þ; y7ð‘Þ; y15ð‘ÞÞ>.\n2.4.3 Best practice tariffs\nThe best practice tariff of hospital k 2X and service/DRG ‘ 2W is, by deﬁnition,\nthe paid price per medical act which is assessed using the information of\nbenchmarks (best practices), which, in turn, are at least as good performer as\nhospital k in the provision of service/DRG ‘. Because hospitals present distinct\ntechnologies and face heterogeneous environments, they must be comparable using\ndata related to the inn- (size, complexity of inpatients) and the out-operational\nenvironment (demographics, epidemiology). Likewise, poor quality hospitals\nshould not be considered potential best practices for k. For that reason, we have\ncreated the concept of comparability sets associated with this hospital. Using it we\ncan formulate the optimal (best practice based) tariff paid to hospital k.\nDeﬁnition 5 (O-order best practice tariff paid to hospital k and service/DRG ‘,\nP\nkð‘;OÞ) Let k 2X be a hospital, ‘ 2W a service or a DRG, and Xkð‘Þ the overall\ncomparability related to the former two. The weighted Ho ¨ lder (or power/general-\nized) mean with order O of a vector V ¼ðV1; ... ; Vi; ... ; VnÞ> and weights\nl ¼ðl1; ... ; li; ... ; lnÞ>, verifying Pn\ni¼1 li ¼1, is\nHðV; l; OÞ¼ l; ðVÞO\nDE 1=O\n; ð7Þ\nwhere h/C1; /C1idenotes the inner-product of two vectors. The O-order best practice\ntariff that should be paid to hospital k is the relationship between the optimal costs\nand the number of in/outpatients for that hospital. We assume that optimal expenses\ncan be modelled as weighted Ho ¨ lder averages with order Oand weights lk:\nPkð‘;OÞ¼HðXkð‘Þ; lk; OÞ\nykð‘Þ : ð8Þ\nIn this case, we assume that the number of in/outpatients is out of control by the\nhospital managers. If this is not the case, we simply have to replace the denominator\nof Eq. ( 8)b y HðYkð‘Þ; lk; OÞ.\nThe O-order best practice tariff paid to hospital k for the service/DRG ‘ in the\nprevious example is, according to Eq. ( 8):\n123\nPay for performance in health care: a new best practice... 2111\nPkð‘;OÞ¼\nlk\n1 /C1ðx4ð‘ÞÞOþlk\n2 /C1ðx7ð‘ÞÞOþlk\n3 /C1ðx15ð‘ÞÞO\n/C16/C17 1=O\ny4ð‘Þ :\nThe problem associated with Eq. ( 8) is that, in general, we do not know the weights\nlk to use. Therefore, instead of imposing quantities with little or even no empirical\nsupport, these weights should be optimized, for instance, using linear programming\ntools. In the next subsections, we discuss how cost savings can arise.\n3 A new best practice tariff-based tool\nIn the last section, we have deﬁned the overall comparability set and explained how\nthe best practice tariffs can be expressed in terms of some coefﬁcients that should be\noptimized using benchmarking tools. In our case, we develop and explore a model\nsimilar to DEA that constructs a log-linear piecewise frontier and which is more\nﬂexible than DEA itself. This ﬂexible model is named multiplicative (or log-) DEA.\nThose coefﬁcients l\nk can be optimized using log-linear programming model, as\ndetailed in Sect. 3.3. This one extends the work of Banker and Maindiratta ( 1986).\nSome properties of the new model are studied in Sect. 3.4. The reader should be\naware of the problem of multiple/degenerate solutions associated with those\ncoefﬁcients, which can be critical to our optimal payments. Therefore, we extend\nour DEA model to solve the problem of multiple solutions (Sect. 3.5). In some\ncircumstances, this model may become infeasible; hence, we propose a strategy to\novercome this problem, vide Sect. 3.6. Finally, Sect. 3.7 presents a simple step-by-\nstep procedure to simplify the exposition and to sum up our approach to optimize\npayments.\n3.1 Past research on multiplicative DEA\nThe proposed way of optimizing tariffs imposes the achievement of Pareto-optimal\nweights l\nk. DEA can be very useful in such a situation. Since its foundation, it\nseems to be the widest employed model for efﬁciency assessment, especially in\nhealth care (Hollingsworth 2008). Because of the underlying convexity, the DEA\nformulation proposed by Banker et al. ( 1984) requires non-increasing marginal\nproducts. However, according to the classical production theory, there are three\nmain stages characterizing the consumption of resources and the associated quantity\nof produced outputs (vide Fig. 2). For input quantities smaller than a, the ﬁxed input\nis being utilized more effectively as the variable input increases (Kao 2017), which\nis to say that the marginal product increases accordingly (Henderson and Quandt\n1980). Before b, the production function (red line) is non-concave and the\nproduction possibility set cannot be convex (Banker and Maindiratta 1986). If the\nstandard DEA model is used to estimate this frontier (dashed line [ Ob]), then some\nefﬁcient observations exploiting gains from increasing specialization with larger\nscale sizes (i.e., close to a) would be rated as inefﬁcient.\n123\n2112 D. C. Ferreira et al.\nAn immediate conclusion is that the convexity assumption must be smoothed to\naccount for the case of increasing marginal products. An alternative is the so-called\nFDH (Deprins et al. 1984), which constructs a frontier with a staircase nature that,\nin turn, is discontinuous in some points and not differentiable (note that we do not\nrequire that the production function must be differentiable). Situations including\nnon-variable returns to scale and imposition of restrictions over multipliers through\nFDH (Ferreira and Marques 2017) require solving a mixed-integer linear program\n(Agrell and Tind 2001), which can be difﬁcult to implement in some solvers.\nAnother alternative is the multiplicative DEA, also named log-DEA or DEA-Cobb–\nDouglas (whose mathematical details will be detailed soon).\nBack nearly 40 years ago, Banker et al. ( 1984) constructed a log-linear model in\nwhich outputs are modelled following a Cobb–Douglas function. Under such a\nframework, outputs do not compete for the inputs, although they do in most of the\nempirical scenarios, including hospitals. Therefore, this model is not applicable in\nthese situations. Charnes et al. ( 1982) suggested a multiplicative efﬁciency measure,\nbut which is not consistent with the postulated underlying production of Banker and\nMaindiratta ( 1986). One year later, the same authors modiﬁed their model to\naccount for non-radial inefﬁciency sources. Nonetheless, they did not examine the\ncharacteristics of the production technology, ignoring concepts like returns to scale,\noptimal scale, and non-competing outputs. Later on, Banker and Maindiratta ( 1986)\nproposed a radial log-DEA that account for competing outputs. These authors have\nveriﬁed that their model outperforms the piecewise linear DEA model of Banker\net al. ( 1984) in terms of rates of substitution of inputs, and especially whenever the\nproduction technology frontier exhibits non-concavity in some regions. In the\npresent work, we follow the model of Banker and Maindiratta, which has not seen\nFig. 2 The three main stages characterizing the consumption of resources and the associated quantity of\nproduced outputs, according to the classical production theory (color ﬁgure online)\n123\nPay for performance in health care: a new best practice... 2113\nfurther meaningful developments and enhancements, despite its advantages (vide\ninfra).\nChang and Guh ( 1995) criticize the remedy of Suayoshi and Chang ( 1989)t o\ntransform the efﬁciency score associated with the multiplicative model of Charnes\net al. ( 1982) into unit invariant. They propose another model, which according to\nSeiford and Zhu ( 1998) reduces itself to the proposal of Charnes et al. This is\nbecause the model of Chang and Guh is for the case of constant output and linearly\nhomogeneous production technology. The authors fail to recognize that the\nconstraint associated with the convexity of the DEA model of Banker et al. is the\nbasis for units invariance. Therefore, according to Seiford and Zhu, the distance\nefﬁciency measure of Chang and Guh is of no value.\nMarginal products are usually related to returns to scale (Ferreira and Marques\n2018a). Since the standard DEA fails to identify the production regions of\nincreasing marginal products, multiplicative DEA models have been used to analyse\nreturns to scale and most productive scale size; vide the works of Zarepisheh et al.\n(2010) as well as Davoodi et al. ( 2015).\nOnly a few applications of the multiplicative DEA model have been published.\nWe point out three: Emrouznejad and Cabanda ( 2010), Tofallis ( 2014) and\nValadkhani et al. ( 2016). The former authors integrated the so-called Beneﬁt of\nDoubt (Cherchye et al. 2011) and the log-DEA to construct a composite indicator\nassociated with six ﬁnancial ratios and twenty-seven UK industries. They conﬁrm\nthat the multiplicative model is more robust than the standard DEA model. In the\nsame vein of Emrouznejad and Cabanda, Tofallis also constructed composite\nindicators with multiplicative aggregation and remarked that the log-DEA avoids\nthe zero weight problem of the standard DEA. Meanwhile, Valadkhani et al.\nproposed a multiplicative extension of environmental DEA models, accounting for\nweakly disposable undesirable outputs, and used it to measure efﬁciency changes in\nthe world’s major polluters. It is interesting to note that the adopted model is very\nclose to the one proposed by Mehdiloozad et al. ( 2014). These authors developed a\ngeneralized multiplicative directional distance function as a comprehensive measure\nof technical efﬁciency, accounting for all types of slacks and satisfying several\ndesirable properties.\nPrevious studies have considered that every observation is enveloped by the log-\nlinear frontier and, for that reason, no infeasibility may arise. If this is not the case,\nprojecting super-efﬁcient observations into the frontier can be infeasible, mostly\nbecause of the undertaken path (model direction) (Chen et al. 2013). Infeasibility\nmay, then, occur if the hospital whose tariff we are optimizing is not enveloped by\nthe frontier. However, should it belong to the reference set used to construct such a\nfrontier, and multiple solutions may be achieved, meaning that the optimal tariff\ncould be non-unique. Neither of these two problems has been properly addressed in\nthe literature with respect to either the multiplicative or log-DEA or the payments\noptimization.\n3.2 Advantages of using log-DEA instead of the standard DEA\nThe advantages of log-DEA can be summarized as follows:\n123\n2114 D. C. Ferreira et al.\n• log-DEA is more ﬂexible than DEA, allowing for increasing marginal products\n(Kao 2017);\n• log-DEA allows for outputs competing for inputs, as happens in most of\nempirical situations, including health care, (Banker and Maindiratta 1986);\n• log-DEA outperforms DEA in terms of rates of substitution of inputs (Banker\nand Maindiratta 1986);\n• log-DEA outperforms DEA when the (unknown) production technology frontier\nexhibits non-concavity regions, (Emrouznejad and Cabanda 2010);\n• log-DEA avoids the zero weight problem of the standard DEA (Tofallis 2014);\n• log-DEA keeps the production technology globally and geometrically convex (or\nnon-convex under the arithmetic deﬁnition), which is a more natural solution.\nIndeed, there is no reason to believe that the production technology must be\n(piecewise) linear and the associated set must be convex. Frontiers related to\nnon-convex sets are always consistent, even if the technology is convex (Daraio\nand Simar 2007). Because of this property, log-DEA can be used to estimate\neconomies of scope (vide a comprehensive discussion in Ferreira et al. 2017);\n• log-DEA mitigates the inefﬁciency overestimation resulting from infeasible\nregions constructed by two or more very distant efﬁcient observations\n(Tiedemann et al. 2011);\n• log-DEA classiﬁes all non-dominated observations as efﬁcient, unlikely DEA.\n3.3 Performance assessment through nonparametric log-linear\nbenchmarking tools\nA very important feature on deﬁning the optimal (best practice based) tariff is the\nvector l\nk ¼ðlk\n1; ... ; lk\ni ; ... ; lk\nJk Þ>. As previously mentioned, the components of this\nvector should be optimized in the Pareto sense. This subsection explains how this\ncan be done for those components. We will describe the construction of a log-linear\npiecewise frontier function from the Jk hospitals composing Xkð‘Þ. This frontier\ncontains the potential benchmarks related to hospital k and the service/DRG ‘.\nFirst of all, we have to deﬁne the concepts of target and target setting .\nDeﬁnition 6 (Targets of hospital k ) Targets are the optimal values associated with\nhospital k for inputs and outputs, ~xkð‘Þand ~ykð‘Þrespectively. Targets must verify the\nconditions:\n~xkð‘Þ6 xkð‘Þ;\n~ykð‘Þ> ykð‘Þ\n(\n: ð9Þ\nDeﬁnition 7 (Target setting for hospital k ) Targets are mathematically deﬁned by\nthe O-order Ho¨ lder average:\n123\nPay for performance in health care: a new best practice... 2115\n~xkð‘Þ¼ lk; Xkð‘Þ/C0/C1ODE 1=O\n;\n~ykð‘Þ¼ lk; Ykð‘Þ/C0/C1ODE 1=O\n8\n><\n>:\n: ð10Þ\nIn the case of O¼ 0 (Banker and Maindiratta 1986), Eq.

( 9) can be\nrewritten as:\nlog ~x\nkð‘Þ6 log xkð‘Þ^log ~ykð‘Þ> log ykð‘Þ;\nand, by Eq. ( 11), we have:\nX\nj2Xkð‘Þ\nlk\nj log xjð‘Þ6 log xkð‘Þ^\nX\nj2Xkð‘Þ\nlk\nj log 1\nyjð‘Þ6 log 1\nykð‘Þ: ð12Þ\nInequalities in ( 12) can be transformed into equations by using (nonnegative) slacks.\nThese slacks can be decomposed into controllable (vector Dk ¼ðdk\n1; dk\n2Þ with\ndk\n1; dk\n2 > 0) and uncontrollable quantities (coefﬁcients bk; sk\n1; and sk\n2). Hence,\nX\nj2Xkð‘Þ\nlk\nj log xjð‘Þþdk\n1bk þsk\n1 ¼log xkð‘Þ^\nX\nj2Xkð‘Þ\nlk\nj log 1\nyjð‘Þþdk\n2bk þsk\n2 ¼log 1\nykð‘Þ()\n() lk; log Xkð‘Þ\nDE\nþdk\n1bk þsk\n1 ¼log xkð‘Þ^ lk; log 1\nYkð‘Þ\n/C28/C29\nþdk\n2bk þsk\n2 ¼log 1\nykð‘Þ;\nð13Þ\nwhere 1=Ykð‘Þ is the Hadamard’s componentwise division between two vectors,\n1 ¼ð1; ... ; 1Þand Ykð‘Þ, and the logarithmic function applies to each component of\nvectors, i.e., log V ¼ðlog V1; ... ; log VJk Þ>.\nThese constraints create a log-linear piecewise frontier function assuming that\nh\nﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ\nlk\np\n;\nﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ\nlk\np\ni¼ 1 and all components of lk are nonnegative. Let us ﬁnd the\nmaximum value of the uncontrollable components using a linear program. In this\ncase, we ﬁrst optimize bk and, once its value has been achieved, we maximize both\nsk\n1 and sk\n2, which justiﬁes the adoption of a non-Archimedean, e. The linear program\nis as follows:\n123\n2116 D. C.

In fact, the efﬁciency of hospital k\nin service/DRG ‘ can be deﬁned as the relationship between optimal targets and\nobservations for both inputs and outputs.\nDeﬁnition 8 (Efﬁciency score , hkð‘Þ) Using the concept of targets, we deﬁne the\nefﬁciency score of hospital k in service/DRG ‘ as Portela and Thanassoulis ( 2006):\nhkð‘Þ¼~xkð‘Þ=xkð‘Þ\n~ykð‘Þ=ykð‘Þ: ð15Þ\nBecause of Deﬁnition 7 and the assumption O¼ 0, which returns a log-linear\npiecewise frontier, Eq.

Notwith-\nstanding, it is not translation invariant and it may exhibit multiple optima solutions.\nBecause of the latter, the optima of log-DEA primal are not sufﬁcient to compute\nthe optimal paid price, P\nkð‘;OÞ; O¼ 0; through the optimized weights lk. We will\nexplore an alternative to provide the unique solution for those weights—the so-\ncalled primal–dual approach for multiple optima.\nProposition 1 (Efﬁciency requirement) If either k 2Xkð‘Þ or\n9j 2Xkð‘Þ: ðxjð‘Þ; yjð‘ÞÞ/C31ðxkð‘Þ; ykð‘ÞÞ,2 then hkð‘Þis bounded by a non-Archimedean ,\ne /C240, and by 1, i.e., the log-DEA primal model veriﬁes the efﬁciency requirement\nproperty.\nProof Under the condition k 2Xkð‘Þ or the condition\n9j 2Xkð‘Þ: ðxjð‘Þ; yjð‘ÞÞ/C31ðxkð‘Þ; ykð‘ÞÞ, all slacks ( dkbk þsk) are nonnegative, and\nthe optimal objective is nonnegative as well. Hence,\nlog 1\nhkð‘Þ > 0 , 1\nhkð‘Þ > exp 0 ¼1 ,hkð‘Þ6 1. h\nProposition 2 (Maximum value of bk) Let Xkð‘Þ¼1\ndk\n1\nlog xkð‘Þ\nminj2Xkð‘Þ xjð‘Þ and\nYkð‘Þ¼1\ndk\n2\nlog 1\nykð‘Þminj2Xkð‘Þ\n1\nyjð‘Þ\n.

Consider the transformation\nof xkð‘Þusing a scalar n 2R: xkð‘Þ/C0!nxkð‘Þ. The ﬁrst constraint of log-DEA primal\nbecomes:\nlk; log nXkð‘Þ\nDE\nþdk\n1bk þsk\n1 ¼log nxkð‘Þ, lk; log n\n/C10/C11\nþ lk; log Xkð‘Þ\nDE\nþdk\n1bk\nþsk\n1 ¼log n þlog xkð‘Þ,\n,log n þ lk; log Xkð‘Þ\nDE\nþdk\n1bk þsk\n1 ¼log n þlog xkð‘Þ, lk; log Xkð‘Þ\nDE\nþdk\n1bk þsk\n1 ¼log xkð‘Þ;\nwhere lk; log nXkð‘Þ/C10/C11\n¼ lk; log n\n/C10/C11\nþ lk; log Xkð‘Þ/C10/C11\nresults from the distributive\nproperty of the inner product and lk; log n\n/C10/C11\n¼log n results from the condition\nh\nﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ\nlk\np\n;\nﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ\nlk\np\ni¼ 1. Thus, the ﬁrst constraint of log-DEA primal is recovered. How-\never, this is only true if Dk does not depend on data; otherwise, the equivalences\nabove do not necessarily hold. Since the same does apply for the output ykð‘Þ,w e\nconclude this proof. h\nProposition 4 (Convexity) The frontier constructed by log-DEA primal model is\nnot convex in the original space of variables. This is because log Tð‘Þ is (normal)\nconvex, meaning that Tð‘Þ is log-convex .\nProof It is not difﬁcult to conclude that, in the log-space, the frontier is convex.\nNow, let us consider a linear facet of the frontier in the log-space. Hence, we have\n123\nPay for performance in health care: a new best practice... 2119\nlog y ¼a log x þb or, equivalently, y ¼xa exp b, which is not linear. That is, in the\noriginal space of variables, the constructed frontier is not convex. h\nProposition 5 (Strict monotonicity) Log-DEA is strictly monotone . hkð‘Þ strictly\ndecreases with the increase of slacks .\nProof The objective function of log-DEA strictly increases with slacks, and so\ndoes log ð1=hkð‘ÞÞ. Because of the monotonicity property of logarithmic functions,\n1=hkð‘Þalso increases with slacks, which means that hkð‘Þdecreases with the increase\nof slacks. In fact, we have hkð‘Þ¼expð/C0bkðdk\n1 þdk\n2Þ/C0sk\n1 /C0sk\n2Þ. This is in line with\nthe efﬁciency requirement property. h\nProposition 6 (Directional nature) Log-DEA is a radial directional model .\nProof Log-DEA is a radial model because of the parameter bk that imposes the\nprojection of hospital k in the frontier constructed using Xkð‘Þ. It is directional\nbecause of the vector Dk, which controls for the path used to project k (Fukuyama\nand Weber 2017). h\nProposition 7 (Translation invariance) Log-DEA is not translation invariant .\nProof This proposition results from the fact that the logarithmic function does not\nverify the distributive property, i.e., log ða þbÞ6¼log a þlog b; 8a; b 2C. h\nProposition 8 (Log-translation invariance) Log-DEA is log-translation invariant .\nProof This is because the log-DEA model is scale invariant. Indeed, scale\ninvariance or log-translation invariance are tantamount. h\nTo introduce the next proposition, we need the dual version of log-DEA primal,\nwhich results from the duality in linear programming. We ﬁrst note that bk is an\nunrestricted variable of log-DEA, which means that it can be transformed into two\nnonnegative variables: bk ¼b\nk\n/C0bk. Additionally, each constraint of the primal\nmodel (except for the nonnegativity of some variables) is modelled by an equation,\nmeaning that two nonnegative variables are required to model each constraint:\nuþ; u/C0 for inputs, vþ; v/C0 for outputs, and wþ; w/C0 for the convexity constraint.\nHence, we get the following set of dual constraints:\nlog xjð‘Þðuþ/C0u/C0Þþlog 1\nyjð‘Þðvþ/C0v/C0Þþðwþ/C0w/C0Þ> 0; j 2Xkð‘Þ; ð18aÞ\nuþ/C0u/C0> e; ð18bÞ\nvþ/C0v/C0> e; ð18cÞ\ndk\n1ðuþ/C0u/C0Þþdk\n2ðvþ/C0v/C0Þ> 1; ð18dÞ\n/C0dk\n1ðuþ/C0u/C0Þ/C0dk\n2ðvþ/C0v/C0Þ> /C01; ð18eÞ\n123\n2120 D.

Indeed, when j ¼k,\nwe have gjv /C0w ¼gkv /C0w: the latter is, precisely, the objective function. h\n3.5 The case of multiple optima\nShould the dual have multiple optima (Proposition 9), then every optimal basic\nsolution to the primal is degenerate. This causes problems in the deﬁnition of\noptimal paid prices. In the absence of degeneracy, two different simplex tableaus in\ncanonical form give two different solutions. Otherwise, it is possible that there are\ntwo different sets of basic variables (coefﬁcients l\nk) giving the same solution\n(efﬁciency score). Since we need unique lk, we must develop a linear program that\nreturns these coefﬁcients verifying such a property.\nBased on proposition 9, if one desires/needs only the efﬁciency score, then there\nis no need for further model improvements. In general, restrictions over dual\nvariables are adopted to include managerial/policy preferences (cf. Shimshak et al.\n(2009), Podinovski ( 2016) and Podinovski and Bouzdine-Chameeva ( 2015, 2016)\nfor a further discussion), but they tend to inﬂuence the efﬁcient frontier shape. That\nis, efﬁciency scores change due to the inclusion of multiplier constraints.\nIntrinsically, these restrictions also minimize (but do not avoid) the multiple\nsolutions problem (Cooper et al. 2007), at the cost of both efﬁciency scores\nchanging and their meaning potential loss. To avoid this serious problem, we follow\nthe approach of Sueyoshi and Sekitani ( 2009) to develop a multiplicative log-DEA\nmodel, which does not violate the desired property of solutions uniqueness. The\nnext two deﬁnitions help us on this goal.\nDeﬁnition 9 (Complementary slackness condition ) The well-known complemen-\ntary slackness theorem of linear programming can be applied to both log-DEA\nprimal and log-DEA dual.

If a variable x veriﬁes x [ a, where a 2R, then there\n123\nPay for performance in health care: a new best practice... 2123\nis a nonnegative quantity a such that x /C0a > a. The objective of US-log-DEA is to\nmaximize the parameter a that transforms the strong complementary slackness\nconditions into feasible linear conditions ( 23h–23j). This means that the optimal\nsolution of US-log-DEA, ðlk/C3; bk/C3; sk/C3\n1 ; sk/C3\n2 ; v/C3; w/C3; a/C3Þ, veriﬁes the strong comple-\nmentary slackness conditions ( 9). US-log-DEA solves the problem of multiple\nprojections in log-DEA dual as it restricts multipliers so that the projection becomes\nunique (Sueyoshi and Sekitani 2009). That is, restricting multipliers v and w does\nnot solve the problem of multiple solutions. Furthermore, it results from the linear\nprogramming theory and from the duality theorem that optima of US-log-DEA are\nalso optima of both log-DEA dual and primal. Therefore, the efﬁciency score h\nkð‘Þ\nremains unchanged. But since we need coefﬁcients lk to deﬁne optimal prices, we\nmust save the outcomes of US-log-DEA for such a purpose. It is needless to say\nthat, by proposition 9,i f k does not belong to Xkð‘Þ, then it is not necessary the use of\nUS-log-DEA as the problem of multiple solutions vanishes in that case.\n3.6 The problem of infeasibility in linear programming models\nWe have developed a log-DEA model to assess the coefﬁcients related to the\noptimal price to be paid to hospital k. In some circumstances, the log-DEA primal\ncan be infeasible because of the choice of the directional vector Dk.I f k 2Xkð‘Þ,\nthen the linear model cannot be infeasible. This is because k is enveloped by the\nfrontier constructed using data associated with that subset of X. However, k may not\nbelong to Xkð‘Þ because of its quality levels. Two scenarios are then suitable: k is\nenveloped by the frontier related to Xkð‘Þ—and, in such a case, there is not an\ninfeasibility problem—or k is super-efﬁcient regarding such a frontier. Only in the\nlatter scenario infeasibility may occur. However, being super-efﬁcient is not a\nsufﬁcient condition to generate infeasibility, vide Proposition 10. We thus have to\nlook at the log-DEA primal and search for a vector Dk linear transformation to\nensure that the model becomes feasible. Naturally, if k belongs to Xkð‘Þ, then a\nmultiple solutions problem arise and the US-log-DEA is compulsory. Nevertheless,\nin such a case, the linear problem cannot be infeasible. If k 62Xkð‘Þ, then the multiple\nsolutions problem vanishes. Hence, it is enough to consider the log-DEA primal.\nProposition 10 (Infeasibility of log-DEA primal) Let Dk ¼ðlog xkð‘Þ; log ykð‘ÞÞ\n(Chambers et al. 1996, 1998). If y kð‘Þ[ 1, yjð‘Þ[ 1 for all j 2Xkð‘Þ; and\nhlk; log Xkð‘Þi[ 2 log xkð‘Þ; then log-DEA primal is infeasible .\nProof This proof follows Ray ( 2008). Under the assumption of Dk ¼\nðlog xkð‘Þ; log ykð‘ÞÞ (Chambers et al. 1996, 1998), we obtain\nhlk; log Xkð‘Þi6 ð1 /C0bkÞlog xkð‘Þ.I f hlk; log Xkð‘Þi[ 2l o gxkð‘Þ,t h e n\nð1 /C0bkÞlog xkð‘Þ[ 2l o gxkð‘Þ,1 /C0bk [ 2 ,bk\\ /C01.

However, given that ykð‘Þ\nis also larger than 1, the right hand side of the inequality associated with Ykð‘Þbecomes\n123\n2124 D. C. Ferreira et al.\nnegative because 1 þbk\\0.

However, hkð‘Þ is unique and can be achieved simply by using the\nlog-DEA primal and the relationship between the efﬁciency score and bk.\nProposition 13 If hospital k is efﬁcient regarding Xkð‘Þ in the Pareto sense\n(absence of slacks) , then Pkð‘;0Þ¼ ^Pkð‘Þ.\nProof If hospital k is efﬁcient regarding Xkð‘Þ in the Pareto sense (absence of\nslacks), then hkð‘Þ¼1 and lk contains one and only one entry that is different from\nzero, i.e., HðYkð‘Þ; lk; 0Þ¼ ykð‘Þ, which implies Pkð‘;0Þ¼ ^Pkð‘Þ from Eq. ( 25). h\nProposition 14 Pkð‘;0Þ\\ ^Pkð‘Þ()hkð‘Þ\\ykð‘Þ=HðYkð‘Þ; lk; 0Þ.\nProof The proposition results directly from ( 25). Let hospital k be inefﬁcient.\nThus, there may exist an inefﬁciency source in the side of outputs, say ~sk\n2. Should it\nbe zero, we have HðYkð‘Þ; lk; 0Þ¼ ykð‘Þ. Yet, because of inputs, k is inefﬁcient by\nhypothesis, and it is clear that hkð‘Þ\\1 and Pkð‘;0Þ\\ ^Pkð‘Þ. That is, the optimal\npayment is smaller than the current unitary cost incurred by k. Should ~sk\n2 be larger\nthan zero, we have HðYkð‘Þ; lk; 0Þ[ ykð‘Þ.

If\n^tð‘Þ\nqr \\~tð‘Þ\nqr (ceteris paribus ), then ^D\nkð‘;0Þ\n> ~D\nkð‘;0Þ\n.\nProof Thresholds are deﬁned as the minimum acceptable quality levels. Let us\ndecrease a threshold related to a given quality dimension, keeping all remaining\nparameters unchanged, i.e. from ~tð‘Þ\nqr to ^tð‘Þ\nqr . Let #A be the cardinality of a set A.I ti s\nclear that # ^X\nkð‘Þ\nq > # ~X\nkð‘Þ\nq , # ^X\nkð‘Þ\ny > # ~X\nkð‘Þ\ny , and # ^X\nkð‘Þ\nz > # ~X\nkð‘Þ\nz . By construc-\ntion, # ^X\nkð‘Þ\n> # ~X\nkð‘Þ\n. Note that we have to impose > instead of [ because a\ndecrease on thresholds does not necessarily increase the cardinality of a set. The\nprobability of k become dominated by the new comparability set increases as a\nconsequence of the broadening of X\nkð‘Þ.4 Therefore, the efﬁciency of hospital k does\nnot increase, and, by Proposition 15, cost savings do not decrease. h\nProposition 20 Let ^b\nkð‘Þ\nqr and ~b\nkð‘Þ\nqr be two bandwidths associated with the r ð‘Þth\nquality dimension .

The contracting process in Portuguese health care services\narises from the relationship between different stakeholders, including (1) public\nfunding sources (the Portuguese State, through taxes), (2) the regulator (an\nindependent Regulatory Agency for Health and the Ministry of Health), and (3) the\nhealth care providers (hospitals, either public or private, primary health care centres,\nand tertiary health care centres) (Sakellarides 2010). Figure 4 shows the ﬁnancial\nﬂow in the Portuguese (NHS). The analysis of this section is centred on public\nhospitals. Most of their ﬁnancing volume comes from taxes, collected from citizens\nand companies. Health care providers are public though autonomous entities,\nimplying that there must be a monitoring model holding them responsible for their\nweak performance and inducing the so-called transparency for the population those\nhospitals serve.\nContracting mechanisms try to allocate resources to health care providers in an\nefﬁcient and effective way, through a clear and well-designed strategy. However, in\nmost European countries there is nothing like a set of indicators allowing the\nevaluation of that strategy impact on the population health status which is a quite\ndifﬁcult task (Figueras et al. 2005; Lu et al. 2003). Accordingly, such a strategy\nrequires a previous ﬁeldwork (negotiation phase) that should be fulﬁlled by a\ncontracting-speciﬁc team from the Ministry of Health. This strategy must be in line\nwith some directions deﬁned by the Portuguese Central Administration of Health\n123\n2130 D. C. Ferreira et al.\nSystems. A robust knowledge on demographics, health policies, and health care\nservices production is compulsory to identify those population and service’s needs.\nStill, predictions of needs and allocated resources are usually constrained by the\nlimited State budget (Mckee and Healy 2002; Galizzi and Miraldo 2011). This\nnegotiation phase should neither be merely symbolic nor bureaucratic, but it must\nhave a relevant role on the budgetary allocation of health facilities, to avoid their\nindebtedness. This means that the process shall be managed with responsibility and\naccountability, and be followed/ monitored over time, which is not a common\npractice in Portugal, though.\nBudgetary constraints and some Government resistance to make some funds\navailable must neither overlap nor limit the health care provision ability/ capacity.\nOtherwise, one may observe the opposite effect, i.e., underfunding generates\noverindebtedness, given the arrears accumulation related to new acquisitions that\nhealth facilities had to do, to carry out their activity. This effect was observed in\nFig. 4 Financial ﬂow in the Portuguese NHS; Source: Barros et al. ( 2011). RHA regional health\nadministration, ACSS Portuguese Central Administration of Health Systems, OOP out-of-pocket payment\n123\nPay for performance in health care: a new best practice... 2131\nPortugal in the past few years, leading to capital injections with money from the\n2011 Memorandum of Understanding between the Portuguese Government and the\nEuropean Commission (on behalf of the Eurogroup), the European Central Bank\nand the International Monetary Fund (Nunes and Ferreira 2019a).\nIn Portugal, contracts between the (central) Government and each health care\nprovider encompass a set of dimensions including the provisions type, volume and\nduration, referencing networks, human resources and facilities, monitoring schemes,\nperformance prizes, and prices. Worth to mention, contracts should also contain\nquality-related terms, including penalties for poor quality. That is, contracting\nhealth care services is paramount to promote a user’s focused action and to improve\nquality and efﬁciency, not only in Portugal but also in any other country.\nPrices are perhaps one of the most important variables within a contract for\nhealth care provision. As a matter of fact, statutory payments to hospitals regard\ntheir production in terms of DRG and services (emergencies, medical appointments,\ninpatient services, ... ). These prices are usually deﬁned according to the smallest\nunitary costs (in the previous year) among providers. Some adjustments regarding\nthe average complexity of treated patients can also be included. Nonetheless, quality\nis clearly neglected in such a framework. We remark that health care services, like\nany other service (either public or not), may exhibit considerable levels of\ninefﬁciency, which means those unitary costs necessarily include an inefﬁciency\nparcel. Furthermore, providers also exhibit heterogeneous technologies (e.g.,\nassets). In a period featured by resources scarcity, ﬁnancing hospitals through an\ninefﬁciency-based mechanism that disregards their underlying technologies is\ntotally nonsense, requiring a considerable reformulation, justifying, in theory, the\nadoption of our approach.\n5.2 Contracting in the Portuguese NHS\nSeveral New Public Management-based health policies have been extensively\napplied to the Portuguese public hospitals. Particularly, their management model\n(legal status) has observed a few changes since the beginning of 2003, moving from\nthe Administrative Public Sector (under the public/administrative law) to the State\nBusiness Sector (under the commercial/private law) in 2005 (Ferreira and Marques\n2015). This was the so-called corporatisation reform . Currently, most of Portuguese\nhospitals belong to the State Business Sector. One of the most relevant issues\nunderlying this reform regards the hospitals ﬁnancing model. While in the past such\na ﬁnancing was based on a retrospective model and prices (or tariffs) derived from\neach hospital history, nowadays this ﬁnancing stems from the negotiation phase and\nthe resulting contract. There is a hospital-speciﬁc budget that is negotiated between\neach hospital’s Administrative Council and the Ministry of Health. Budget is\nnegotiated in terms of production and quality, in line with some other European\ncountries like Finland, Ireland, France, and England. In Portugal, paid unitary price\n(tariff) results from the national average of DRGs or services’ costs. Patients are\nassigned to a speciﬁc DRG and/or to a speciﬁc service. In any case, tariffs are\ntabled, which means they are the same for all hospitals, regardless their\nperformance. In other words, the current mechanism is basically a case-based\n123\n2132 D. C. Ferreira et al.\npayment, which encompasses several disadvantages: ﬁrst, it may prompt the\nsupplier-induced demand that, in turn, includes unwanted activity; second, more\ncomplex cases can be disregarded or treated negligently, which reduces the overall\nquality of care; third, providers are encouraged to up-code classiﬁcation of patients\ninto a more highly reimbursed group; fourth, the introduction of quality-raising\n(though cost-increasing) technologies is totally discouraged (Marshall et al. 2014).\nValente ( 2010) identiﬁes several contracting objectives: (1) to control health care\nprovision-related expenses that could jeopardise the system sustainability in the\nmedium to long term; (2) to promote providers’ efﬁciency, by simultaneously\nincreasing their production and quality, and decreasing their resources consumption;\n(3) to ensure high quality levels of care; and (4) to promote the hospital managers’\naccountability. As a matter of fact, besides production and quality that must be\nensured, there are several contract-speciﬁc objectives that must be fulﬁlled under\npain of penalties.\nThe contracting process in the Portuguese NHS has seen considerable changes\nover the past 13 years, as it must ﬁt to reality, available resources, needs, and\ntechnological developments. These dynamics and the usual process redeﬁnition and\nre-adaptation promote an adjustment mechanism of the hospitals’ performance\n(either ﬁnancial or not) program, encouraging the objectives for which the contract\nwas created. Currently, the contracting process between the Portuguese public\nhospitals and the Ministry of Health integrates a triennial strategic planning process\nmerging the existing forecasting documents, i.e., the Business Plan, the Performance\nPlan, and the Adjustment Plan and Financial Statements.\n5.3 Data, sample, hypotheses and methodological issues\nTo exemplify the new tool, we use monthly data of twenty nine hospitals and their\nactivity in 2016 and 2017, which results on 696 observations. Following Ferreira\nand Marques ( 2017), the sample does not include two out of the four public–private\npartnership hospitals (because of data gaps), three highly differentiated hospitals as\noncology centres (because of their production technology that signiﬁcantly differs\nfrom the one of general hospitals), and local health units (since they result from the\nvertical merging of a general hospital and several primary health care units). Data\nare available in the ofﬁcial source website ( http://benchmarking.acss.min-saude.pt/).\nAvailable (operational) expenditures refer to the whole activity of the hospital,\nhence we can assess the optimal payment by patient if our measure of output is the\nnumber of standard patients.\nSelected variables are exhibited in Fig. 5. Data are available on-line.\n5 Quality\nindicators refer to patients’ clinical safety, care appropriateness and timeliness, and\naccess to health care. In this case, we have followed the variables adopted by\nFerreira and Marques ( 2018b), taking into account the data availability for all the\n696 observations. There is a maximum legal time for a secondary health care\nresponse to the citizens searching for (nonurgent) medical appointments and for\nsurgeries. Overstepping such a time indicates poor access to the health care services.\n5 https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1I0qxCQcKp2SZRBkoF4zu1WxGRvjIZkXF?usp=sharing.\n123\nPay for performance in health care: a new best practice... 2133\nThis is a phenomenon revealed by small values of both Q1 and Q2. Minor surgeries\nshould be made in ambulatory services, otherwise the patient can be subject to more\ncomplex procedures and to hospital acquired severe infections. The costs of\nsurgeries undertaken in the operating theatre are, of course, larger than the others.\nMinor surgeries accomplished in ambulatory services reveal good care appropri-\nateness and efﬁciency levels. Hence, the larger Q\n3, the better. In opposition, high\nvalues of Q4 up to Q8 reveal poor levels of care appropriateness and clinical safety.\nAs we have noted before, our methodology assumes that the utility function\nrelated to each quality level should be monotonically increasing, i.e.,\n8qkð‘Þ\nrð‘Þ > qjð‘Þ\nrð‘Þ ¼)Urð‘ÞðkÞ> Urð‘ÞðjÞ; k; j 2X. This means that quality dimensions\nQ4 up to Q8 must be transformed. Additionally, the deﬁnition of thresholds can be\nfacilitated if all quality dimensions are rescaled to the interval [0,100]%. For\ninstance, rates of bloodstream infections resulting from central venous catheter are\nexpressed in cases per 100,000 surgeries. Rescaling quality dimensions also reduce\nthe odds of having empty comparability sets and, hence, reducing the number of\ninteractions with the decision maker(s). We use the following rescaling procedure:\n~q\nkð‘Þ\nrð‘Þ ¼\n100 qkð‘Þ\nrð‘Þ /C0min Qrð‘Þ\nmax Qrð‘Þ /C0min Qrð‘Þ\n; ifrð‘Þ¼1; 2; 3;\n100 max Qrð‘Þ /C0qkð‘Þ\nrð‘Þ\nmax Qrð‘Þ /C0min Qrð‘Þ\n; otherwise:\n8\n>>\n>\n><\n>>>\n>\n:\nð28Þ\nTherefore, the larger ~q\nkð‘Þ\nrð‘Þ , the better the utility and the performance of the hospital.\n⎧\n⎪⎪⎪⎪\n⎪⎪\n⎪\n⎪⎪\n⎪⎪⎪\n⎪⎪⎪⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪⎪\n⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪\n⎪⎪⎪\n⎪⎪\n⎪⎪⎪\n⎪\n⎪⎪\n⎪⎪\n⎪⎨\n⎪⎪\n⎪⎪\n⎪\n⎪⎪⎪\n⎪⎪\n⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪\n⎪⎪\n⎪⎪\n⎪\n⎪⎪⎪\n⎪⎪\n⎪⎪\n⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪\n⎪⎪⎪\n⎪⎪⎪⎩\nI\nNPUT\n{\nX : Total operating expenses\nOUTPUT\n{\nY : Number of standard patients\nQUALITY\n⎧\n⎪⎪⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪⎪⎪⎪\n⎪⎨\n⎪⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪\n⎪\n⎪⎪⎩\nQ\n1 : NU ﬁrst medical appointments within the MLGRT per 100 NU ﬁrst appointments\nQ2 : NU surgeries within the MLGRT per 100 NU surgeries\nQ3 : Minor surgeries per potential minor surgeries\nQ4 : Rate of readmissions within 30 days after discharge\nQ5 : Rate of bedridden cases\nQ6 : Rate of bloodstream infections resulting from CVC\nQ7 : Rate of postoperative pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis\nQ8 : Rate of postoperative septicaemia\nENVIRONMENT\n⎧\n⎪⎪⎪\n⎪⎪\n⎪⎪\n⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪\n⎨\n⎪⎪\n⎪⎪\n⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪\n⎪⎪⎪⎩\nZ\n1 : Population density\nZ2 : Elderly rate\nZ3 : Child mortality rate\nZ4 : Stillbirth rate\nZ5 : Illiteracy rate\nZ6 : Purchasing power\nZ7 : Case-mix index for inpatient services\nZ8 : Gini’s specialization index\nFig. 5 Input, output, quality, and environment.

Ferreira et al.\nThe hospital j 2X with ~qjð‘Þ\nrð‘Þ ¼100 is the best performer in the quality dimension\nrð‘Þ2Cð‘Þ. In opposition, ~qj0ð‘Þ\nrð‘Þ ¼0 identiﬁes the hospital j02X with the worst\nperformance in the very same quality dimension. Table 1 presents the basic\nstatistics associated with the rescaled quality variables. Hereinafter, we will con-\nsider the global bandwidths computed by using the triweight kernel, i.e., bjð‘Þ\nqr ¼\nbjþ1ð‘Þ\nqr ¼3:62^rqr J/C01=5 ¼0:9799^rqr ; 8j ¼1; ... ; J /C01; with J ¼696. We will also\nuse the average of the distributions to represent the user predeﬁned thresholds,\ntð‘Þ\n~qr\n¼1\nJ\nPJ\nj¼1 ~qkð‘Þ\nrð‘Þ . We observe that averages and medians are similar; thus, we have\nroughly half of the sample (348 observations) above each threshold. Of course, there\nis a correspondence between the rescaled and the original threshold. Indeed, take the\ncase of rð‘Þ¼1; if tð‘Þ\n~qr\n¼54:52, then tð‘Þ\nqr ¼tð‘Þ\n~qr\nmax Q1/C0min Q1\n100 þmin Q1 ¼\n54:52 99:99/C034:51\n100 þ34:51 ¼70:21, which is (hypothetically) the minimum accept-\nable number of nonurgent ﬁrst medical appointments within the maximum legal\nguaranteed response time per 100 ﬁrst appointments.\nEnvironment is also paramount to derive optimal payments to hospitals. We have\nselected six dimensions that intend to capture the population’s demography and two\nmore to explain the complexity and specialization degree of each hospital. The case-\nmix index relates the costs associated with each DRG and the quantity of patients of\nthe very same group. The larger the number of patients of higher complexity, the\nlarger the case-mix index. This one is usually rescaled such that the national average\nis set as 1; hence, hospitals with a case-mix larger than 1 usually handle with more\ncomplex cases. Meanwhile, the Gini’s specialization degree, as proposed by\nDaidone and D’Amico ( 2009) and Lindlbauer and Schreyo ¨ gg ( 2014), is related to\nthe hospital efﬁciency and ranges between 0 (low specialization) and 1 (high\nspecialization). Table 2 provides the basic statistics related to environmental\nvariables. As before, we have adopted the triweight kernel to compute global\nbandwidths. In the case of environment dimensions, no data transformations are\nrequired.\nTable 1 Statistics associated with the rescaled quality variables\nQ1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q5 Q6 Q7 Q8\nPercentile 25% 41.33 42.19 76.20 30.51 92.38 100.00 98.72 75.47\nMedian 52.61 57.73 80.89 38.84 100.00 100.00 100.00 89.78\nAverage ( /C22x) 54.52 59.25 80.10 39.34 94.87 96.29 99.16 85.87\nPercentile 75% 65.89 78.62 85.35 46.33 100.00 100.00 100.00 100.00\nStandard deviation ( ^r) 20.37 23.76 9.23 15.12 9.73 11.87 3.93 17.17\nGlobal bandwidth (Triweight\nkernel)\n19.96 23.28 9.05 14.82 9.53 11.63 3.85 16.82\nCoefﬁcient of variation ( ^r= /C22x) 37.36 40.10 11.53 38.44 10.25 12.33 3.97 19.99\nKurtosis 2.82 2.16 20.98 5.26 19.27 22.59 582.92 4.96\nSkewness 0.28 0.01 - 2.62 0.79 - 3.09 - 4.12 - 23.13 - 1.36\n123\nPay for performance in health care: a new best practice... 2135\nOptimization models were developed and solved through the integration of the\npackage IBM ILOG CPLEX /C210 Optimization Studio, v12.6.3, and the MATLAB /C210\nsoftware.

The algorithm can be delivered upon\nrequest.\n5.4 Results and discussion\nOnce the overall set has been deﬁned for each hospital, based on its corresponding\nsize-, quality-, and environment-based comparability sets, we can use the US-log-\nDEA to optimize operational expenses and, by construction, paid prices.\nLet us consider the case of observation k ¼100, for which we have\nX\nkð‘Þ\nz ¼f97; 98; ... ; 100; ... ; 119; 120; 385; 386; ... ; 407; 408g\nand\nXkð‘Þ\nq ¼f37; 126; 127; 128; 139; 143; 241; 575; 685; 689; 691g:\nSince k 62Xkð‘Þ\nq , we state that its quality levels are below the minimum required\nquality deﬁned by the stakeholder(s). It is clear that k 2Xkð‘Þ\nz because of the deﬁ-\nnition of the environment-related comparability set. As Xkð‘Þ\nz \\Xkð‘Þ\nq ¼;, no opti-\nmization procedure can be executed. Hence, we have to slightly change some\nparameters (bandwidths and/or thresholds) to get a nonempty overall comparability\nset. So, while that set remains empty, we iteratively increase the bandwidths by 5%\nand to reduce the thresholds by the same rate, until the emptiness problem vanishes.\nIn the case of k ¼100, with a single iteration, we got\nX\nkð‘Þ¼f126; 127; 128; 141; 142; 143g. These observations (hospitals) are still bet-\nter performers than k in terms of quality. Because k 62Xkð‘Þ we do not have to use\nthe US-log-DEA, as there is not a problem of multiple solutions.

Yet, being super-efﬁcient does not mean that the optimal paid price\nshould be larger than the current unitary cost. In fact, we get Pkð‘;0Þ¼2183, which\ncompares with ^Pkð‘Þ¼3336. Thus, the optimal payment is about 35% smaller than\nthe current unitary cost of k.\nBy executing the procedure proposed in Sect. 3.7, we obtained the optimal\npayments per standard patient. The optimal quantity of resources for the 2 years of\nstudy was ¤6,290,336,455, against ¤8,967,878,333 of consumed resources, which\nmeans that nearly 30% of them were wasted. The average payment was ¤1862 per\nstandard patient, whereas the average current unitary cost is about ¤3052 (1.64\ntimes the average optimal payment). Figure 6 exhibits the histogram and some\nparametric probability density functions associated with optimal payments. 6\nFigure 7 does the same for the current unitary costs related to standard patients.\nOptimal payments seem to be well ﬁtted by a generalized extreme value distribution\nwith n ¼0:58½0:46; 0:70/C138(shape parameter), r ¼322:90½292:73; 356:18/C138(scale\nparameter), and l ¼1460:60½1428:39; 1492:81/C138(location parameter).\n7 Meanwhile,\ncurrent unitary costs are modelled by the t location-scale probability distribution,\nwith n ¼3:61½2:71; 4:81/C138(shape), r ¼451:49½410:56; 496:50/C138(scale), and l ¼\n3012:15½2971:61; 3052:69/C138(location).\nOptimal payments Optimal payments are well modelled by a generalized extreme\nvalue distribution (GEV) with support p 2½903:88; þ1½ and c.d.f.\nProbðPjð‘;0Þ6 pÞ¼ expf/C0mðpÞg, with mðpÞ¼ 53; 987=ðp /C0901:98Þ1=0:58.\n6 Plots have been obtained through the program ‘allﬁtdist.m’ available for MATLAB: https://github.com/\ndcherian/tools/blob/master/misc/allﬁtdist.m.\n7 Because the shape parameter is positive, the distribution belongs to the Fre ´chet family of distributions.\n123\nPay for performance in health care: a new best practice... 2137\nAccordingly, the mean and the median of the distribution are, respectively, mean ¼\nEðPjð‘;0ÞÞ¼ l þr\nn ðCð1 /C0nÞ/C01Þ/C252079 and median ¼l þr\nn ð/C01 þðln 2Þ/C0nÞ/C25\n1593 ( ¤ per patient).

Figure 8 plots the c.d.f. of both optimal tariffs and current unitary costs.\nBecause of the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem and the monotonic nature of c.d.f., we\nknow that DðpÞ¼ Probð^Pjð‘Þ6 pÞ/C0ProbðPjð‘;0Þ6 pÞ¼ 0 has a solution in the\ninterval p 2½3500; 4500/C138¤. More precisely, the solution is close to ¤3993, asso-\nciated with Prob ðPjð‘;0Þ6 pÞ¼ 0:9485. This means that there is a small probability\nof 5% of observing hospitals whose optimal tariff is larger than their unitary costs.\nThis result clearly state the advantage of the proposed framework: in 95% of the\ncases, the model was capable of achieving a tariff lower than the current unitary cost\nat the same time that important dimensions like quality and operational environment\nare accounted for. This is an important issue as sustainability should ensure that\nquality is not hampered.\nWe also used the stepwise forward multiple regression method to relate optimal\npayments to environment dimensions:\nP\njð‘;0Þ¼236 zjð‘Þ\n1\nr1\nþ76 zjð‘Þ\n3\nr3\nþ92 zjð‘Þ\n5\nr5\nþ73 zjð‘Þ\n6\nr6\nþ367 zjð‘Þ\n7\nr7\nþ99 zjð‘Þ\n8\nr8\n; j 2X;\nwhere rcð‘Þ is the standard deviation of environment dimension cð‘Þ. This regression\nveriﬁes R2 /C2550%, meaning that half of the data variance remains unexplained by\nthe linear model. Note that including second-order terms into the linear model will\nonly improve the coefﬁcient of determination by 3%. Because explanatory variables\n123\nPay for performance in health care: a new best practice... 2139\nwere standardized, coefﬁcients help us on deﬁning the most important predictors for\noptimal payments and it becomes clear that these ones are the population density,\nthe illiteracy rate, the case-mix index (complexity), and the Gini’s specialization\ndegree. Illiteracy is negatively correlated with the remaining three dimensions.\nFurthermore, we may foresee that more differentiated facilities also handle with\nmore complex cases and are located in urban regions (mostly in the coastline),\nwhich, in turn, are more densely populated and whose citizens have higher literary\nlevels. Those providers are, according to our multiple linear model, the ones whose\npayment will be the largest.\nAs we have pointed out before, payments are currently set as the smallest unitary\ncost within the group in which the hospital is positioned. It takes into account\nneither quality nor the environment, a pitfall on deﬁning optimal payments. There\nare four groups of hospitals in Portugal (B, C, D, and E).\n8 Table 3 presents the\ncomparison between the current procedure to ﬁx payments and our approach. As we\ncan see, our approach allows substantial cost savings but these ones represent only\n54% of savings that could be achieved through the current procedure. We remark,\nhowever, that such a level of cost savings result from ignoring quality dimensions\n(which usually are costly as they require investments, Karagiannis and Velentzas\n2012) and from unfair comparisons (because environment and technology are not\nconsidered in the current procedure). Although hospitals are currently clustered\nbased on dimensions related to size, it is not sufﬁcient to make adequate\ncomparisons. It is also interesting to observe that, according to our approach, the\npotential cost savings decrease with the increase of both size and complexity of the\nFig. 8 Cumulative distributions of optimal tariffs and current unitary costs\n8 There is another one, F, which is composed of oncology centres.

Ferreira et al.\nhealth care providers (in opposition to the current approach). One could think that\nthe larger the hospital, the more resources it could save if it would be efﬁcient;\nhowever, this is not linear because these hospitals are also the ones receiving and\ntreating the most complex and resources consuming patients, meaning that the\nmargin for cost savings also decreases given their complex structures—this is,\nindeed, in line with our approach which adjusts the performance of health care\nproviders to their internal and external operational environment. That is, our\napproach still contributes to the Portuguese health care system’s sustainability,\nalthough with smaller cost saving levels when compared to the currently adopted\nmethodology (which, in turn, seems to induce misconducts within the ﬁeld as an\noutcome of absurd cost constraints).\nOf course, these results may strongly depend on parameters like the threshold and\nthe bandwidths. Thresholds can be understood as the minimum levels of quality to\nbe a potential benchmark. Such levels depend on the stakeholder(s) point of view.\nWe may expect that the smaller the threshold, the larger the cost savings because\nunderinvestments on quality are allowed, which is in line with Proposition 19.\nLikewise, the deﬁnition of bandwidths may play a relevant role on cost savings, see\nProposition 20. The extreme case of these two propositions occurs when thresholds\nare t\nð‘Þ\nqr ¼0 for all rð‘Þ2Cð‘Þand bkð‘Þ\ny ; bkð‘Þ\nqr ; bkð‘Þ\nzc /C0! þ1. In this case, Xkð‘Þ/C0!X,\nso it is sufﬁcient to apply US-log-DEA altogether the frontier constructed using the\nentire sample to obtain optimal payments which, in turn, disregard size,\nenvironment, and quality. In our empirical application, this results on cost savings\nof roughly ¤3145 million, a value that is obviously above the cost savings using our\napproach with thresholds set by the median of quality indicators, but still below the\ncost savings according to the current procedure adopted by the Portuguese Ministry\nof Health. We, then, suspect that the approach adopted by the Ministry is too\nconservative and induces the health care system’s underfunding. Probably because\nof that several authors have reported a considerable missing of resources in the\nPortuguese health system (Nunes et al. 2019; Nunes and Ferreira 2019b).\nAccordingly, our approach is more ﬂexible, contributing for the system’s\nsustainability at the same time that quality of delivered services is ensured and\ncomparisons for benchmarking purposes are fair, being based on both external and\ninternal conditions in which hospitals operate.\nTable 3 Comparison between the current procedure to ﬁx payments and our approach\nGroup Price (current\nprocedure)\nPrice (our approach),\naverage\nCost savings (current\nprocedure)/¤106\nCost savings (our\napproach)/¤106\nB 1338 1494 211 195\nC 1619 1678 864 832\nD 1136 1836 1482 833\nE 1843 2633 1674 447\nTotal 4231 2307\n123\nPay for performance in health care: a new best practice... 2141\n6 Concluding remarks and the economic impact to the NHS\nThis paper proposes and explores a new tool that achieves the best tariffs set for a\nhealth care provider. This achievement clearly encompasses both components of\nquality and ﬁnancial sustainability, and ﬁnances those providers based on their past\nperformance and on the existence of potential benchmarks, which in turn spend\nfewer resources to treat a comparable quantity of patients, show higher levels of\nquality, and act on similar environment (inner/outer). Our approach can optimize\npayments in several payment schemes extensively adopted worldwide.\nThe proposed tool has several advantages. As a matter of fact, it has a clear\nimpact on the health care ﬁnancial system, since costs are reduced as a function of\nproviders’ performance. Considerable potential cost savings arise as a result of the\napplication of the new tool. Additionally, potential benchmarks cannot show quality\nlevels below the stakeholder(s) expectations. It is not clear whether higher quality\nlevels do imply or not higher costs. Although high quality-based facilities are\nusually expensive, in the long-run it may contribute to the reduction of hospital\ndays, postoperative complications, inner-hospital infections, readmissions, and\ndeaths. Furthermore, high quality hospitals tend to attract more patients. Since\nmoney follows the patient , the competition between providers is expected to\nimprove their performance and to reduce wasted resources. Competition is\ncommonly associated with performance improvements. Due to the competition,\nactivity tends to increase; assuming that it is cost-effective and appropriate, it\nbecomes another advantage of the proposed strategy (Geissler et al. 2011). If scope\nand scale economies can be exploited, then the more patients treated, the lower the\nprovider cost per patient. If the provider is able to join both cost savings due to scale\neconomies and high quality standards, it becomes a potential benchmark in our\nframework. If an inefﬁcient hospital achieves a tariff lower than its current unitary\ncost, then it has room to improve its practices, once there is, at least, one unit\nproducing roughly the same amount of outputs, with fewer resources and better\nquality. That is, the inefﬁcient one should learn from its benchmarks’ practices. By\nreducing the payment for such a hospital, it can increase its income by increasing its\nproduction. But then again, the invisible hand of competition will impose that\nproduction increasing is possible if and only if quality is improved. In other words,\nthe reduction of payments for some hospitals will force their production increase on\nthe one hand, and reduce the total costs and wastefulness in the long-run if scale\neconomies are correctly explored, on the other hand.\nAdditionally, low-quality units may receive a tariff higher than their current cost\nper patient, which should be seen as an incentive to improve their quality by\nintroducing quality-raising through cost-increasing new technologies (Quentin et al.\n2011; Marshall et al. 2014). Even for very high quality thresholds, this scenario can\nhappen for most (if not all) units if the provider with the best quality standards also\nexhibits signiﬁcant signs of technical inefﬁciency. In such a case, the stake-\nholder(s) must decide whether the threshold is in fact too high, or an incentive to\nquality improvement across the entire sample shall be placed on the table . If the last\nscenario is adopted and both quality and efﬁciency are not positively related, the\n123\n2142 D. C. Ferreira et al.\nﬁnancial sustainability can be threatened. This means that the stakeholder(s) has a\nprominent role, by deﬁning a priori which criteria must be utilised to deﬁne quality\nand how to deﬁne an appropriate threshold. This one can be perhaps optimized to\nmaximise potential cost savings, which is left for a further research.\nAs in the case-based payment scheme, several disadvantages or difﬁculties can\nbe identiﬁed for the new ﬁnancing tool. Yet, one must be aware that there is not an\navailable ﬂawless reimbursement method. We can only try to minimize the\nshortcomings of available schemes. Most of those disadvantages identiﬁed for the\nnew scheme (our proposal) can be reduced by implementing strong contract\nmanagement tools. For instance, State’s ﬁnancial control can be improved if volume\nof care is speciﬁed in contract. Quality standards are also set. If they are not\naccomplished, pre-deﬁned penalties can be applied in further contracts, reducing the\nnew budget. Also, selecting the least complex and severe patients must also be\nprevented in contracts. However, some disadvantages still remain. Indeed, if\npayment is made according to DRGs, the incorrect patients’ registry is likely in\npractice and can be even promoted through the new tool. For instance, a patient\nfrom a speciﬁc DRG is assigned to a different DRG group (Vita 2001), simply\nbecause contracted volumes must be accomplished and/or the income must be\nincreased to overcome some mismanagement scenarios. It is not so simple to\nmitigate such a situation, especially because there is a resistance on medical group\nas well as a pre-deﬁned DRG quantity to be produced. Registry systems are\ndifferent among providers, thus they must be updated and uniformed, and an\nintegrated system should be created. It must cross and relate data from different\nlevels of care (primary, secondary, tertiary), and detect potential bias on expected\ntreatments for a speciﬁc patient. Another alternative would be increasing the\ncontracted production range, which would mitigate the aforementioned\nmisregistration.\nFinally, by creating a database with the production of all hospitals, costs and\nquality, for several years, it is possible to reﬁne the potential best practice search for\neach entity, as few years may ensure a larger range of possible optimal payments.\nFor instance, a hospital may present an optimal current unitary cost, which could be\nnon-optimal in the past. Thus, its corresponding tariff will be lower than its current\ncost per patient. Accordingly, we expect a convergence of health care providers’\nperformance in the long-run.\nAcknowledgements This research was generously supported by the project ‘hSNS: Portuguese public\nhospital performance assessment using a multi-criteria decision analysis framework’ (PTDC/EGE-OGE/\n30546/2017), funded by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT, from the\nPortuguese abbreviation of Fundac¸a˜o para a Cieˆncia e a Tecnologia) (Grant No. 02/SAICT/2017/30546).\nThe ﬁrst author also acknowledges the ﬁnancial support by FCT: Grant SFRH/BD/113038/2015.
