    "abstract": "The EuroQol is a simple method of deriving a single utility value for quality of life and is responsive to changes after lung transplantation. It is worth considering as a means of monitoring quality of life after transplantation and as an index of quality of survival in research studies in solid organ transplantation. These data suggest that quality of life after transplantation of one lung is inferior to that after transplantation of two lungs.",
