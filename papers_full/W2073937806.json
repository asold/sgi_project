    "abstract": "This paper presents a transformer model that is useful for lowfrequency applications. To describe the iron-core magnetic behavior, the Jiles Atherton hysteresis model is used, which is able to generate minor asymmetric loops and remanent flux. The obtained results are compared with those measured in the laboratory on a commercial resistance welding transformer.",
