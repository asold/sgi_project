    "abstract": "Agent teamwork has been widely studied in the fields of Distributed AI. Much success has been achieved in defining agent teamwork theory to explain how agents should act together as a team and in developing programming frameworks to simulate team coordination in software environment. With the advent of ubiquitous computing technology, agent teamwork research will be pushed to its limit, facing new challenges in an open environment with a higher degree of uncertainty. The objective of this paper is to raise some research issues that need to addressed in order to enable ubiquitous agents to engage in cooperative teamwork activities.",
