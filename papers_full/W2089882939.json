    "abstract": "The electrical circuit equivalents of magnetic device structures such as transformer require an exact knowledge of its parameters. Efficient parameter estimation technique is essential to obtain the equivalent circuit parameters of transformer because the parameters are used to manipulate parasitic elements and to obtain the enhanced circuit performance. In this paper, Bacterial Foraging Algorithm (BFA) has been applied to estimate the equivalent circuit parameters of single phase core type transformer. The information of open Circuit (OC) and Short Circuit (SC) tests has been utilized in BFA algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been tested with a sample transformer and the simulation results are compared against the conventional method. The numerical results show that the proposed approach outperforms the conventional method in the aspects of solution quality.",
