INTRODUCTION \nCybersecurity has entered a new era where automation is no longer optional but essential. As the volume, velocity, \nand complexity of cyber threats continue to increase, security operations centers (SOCs) are rapidly adopting \nAgentic Artificial Intelligence (AI)—AI systems that act autonomously, make context-aware decisions, and self-\nadjust their actions without direct human supervision. \nThese agentic systems promise a paradigm shift: from rule -based alert triage and static playbooks to dynamic, real -\ntime decision -making and continuous learning across threat environments. Examples include autonomous \npenetration testing bots, AI -driven incident responders, and generative AI models used for adversarial simulation. \nHowever, this unprecedented capability introduces new vulnerabilities : models acting beyond their training \ndistribution, unanticipated behaviors duri7ng system drift, and policy conflicts across multiple autonomous agents.  \nThis paper introduces the Model–Control–Policy (MCP) governance framework to address these challenges. We \nargue that traditional cybersecurity governance mechanisms—designed for static or semi-automated environments—\nare inadequate for managing autonomous agents capable of reasoning, adapting, and initiating  actions. Through a \nmulti-layer analysis spanning architecture, adversarial threats, interpretability, and regulation, we provide a \ncomprehensive foundation for understanding and guiding the secure evolut ion of agentic AI in cybersecurity \ndomains. \n1.1 Motivation and Scope \nSeveral real-world deployments underscore the urgency for robust governance models:  \n● Darktrace Antigena uses self-learning AI to autonomously respond to cyber threats [1]. \n● GPT-4 agents are increasingly integrated into phishing simulators and red-teaming toolkits [2]. \n● Autonomous remediation tools  such as IBM's SOAR platform dynamically update firewalls and kill \nmalicious processes without human approval [3]. \nJournal of Information Systems Engineering and Management \n2025, 10(52s) \ne-ISSN: 2468-4376 \n  \nhttps://www.jisem-journal.com/ Research Article  \n \n 613 Copyright © 2024 by Author/s and Licensed by JISEM.

BACKGROUND: AGENTIC AI AND CYBERSECURITY AUTOMATION  \nThe integration of artificial intelligence into cybersecurity has evolved from static machine learning classifiers to \nagentic AI—systems endowed with the autonomy to reason, act, and adapt within dynamic environments. Unlike \ntraditional AI models trained for singular tasks, agentic AI systems are designed to pursue objectives across stateful \nenvironments, often interfacing with multiple tools, datasets, and decision contexts. \n2.1 Defining Agentic AI \nAgentic AI refers to AI systems that exhibit: \n● Goal-oriented behavior: Capable of operating toward defined objectives. \n● Autonomy: Independent execution without real-time human input. \n● Contextual reasoning: Adjusting actions based on changing system states. \n● Interactive decision-making: Coordinating with other agents or systems dynamically.  \nThis behavior is often realized through multi -agent systems, reinforcement learning, or LLM -based planners, such \nas AutoGPT and ReAct [4], integrated into security operations. \n2.2 Evolution of AI in Cybersecurity \nGeneration Capability Examples \n1st Gen (2010s) Static ML classifiers Email spam detection, anomaly detection in logs \n2nd Gen (2020 –\n2022) \nSemi-autonomous triage \nsystems \nEDR alerts ranked by ML, automated IOC \nenrichment \n3rd Gen (2023+) Agentic AI workflows AI-driven threat hunting bots, dynamic SOC \nautomation tools \nAgentic AI workflows are being embedded in: \n● Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platforms for proactive alerting. \nJournal of Information Systems Engineering and Management \n2025, 10(52s) \ne-ISSN: 2468-4376 \n  \nhttps://www.jisem-journal.com/ Research Article  \n \n 614 Copyright © 2024 by Author/s and Licensed by JISEM.

Reinforcement Learning (RL) : Enables agents to learn sequences of actions that yield long-term \nrewards. Applications include automated patching, intrusion response, and behavior -based malware \nmitigation [5]. \n2. Large Language Models (LLMs) : When integrated into agentic frameworks, LLMs like GPT -4 perform \nthreat report summarization, threat actor profiling, and dynamic playbook generation [6].  \n3. Multi-Agent Systems (MAS): These systems coordinate agent teams across the security stack —e.g., one \nagent detects, another analyzes, and a third responds, all in a closed loop [7].  \n4. Toolformer Frameworks: Agentic architectures where LLMs control APIs, databases, and command-line \ninterfaces to perform complex tasks like threat hunting or pentesting [8].  \n2.4 Challenges of Autonomy in Security Contexts \nChallenge Implication \nRunaway Execution Autonomous agents might loop indefinitely or take unapproved \nactions. \nOverfitting to Simulation RL agents may learn strategies that fail in real-world data. \nOpacity and Interpretability Deep models may act in ways that are not human-auditable. \nPrompt Injection and \nManipulation \nLLM-based agents are susceptible to crafted inputs that alter \nbehavior. \nPolicy Misalignment Agent objectives may conflict with organizational policies. \nThese challenges motivate the need for a robust governance structure that includes behavioral boundaries, \nauditability, and fail-safe triggers. \n3. THE MCP GOVERNANCE MODEL FOR AGENTIC AI IN CYBERSECURITY  \nTo ensure that autonomous agents operate within safe, ethical, and organizationally aligned boundaries, we propose \nthe Model–Control–Policy (MCP) governance model. Inspired by multi-layered control theory and cybersecurity \ncompliance architectures, MCP decomposes agentic AI governance into three distinct but interdependent layers: the \nModel Layer, the Control Layer, and the Policy Layer. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJournal of Information Systems Engineering and Management \n2025, 10(52s) \ne-ISSN: 2468-4376 \n  \nhttps://www.jisem-journal.com/ Research Article  \n \n 615 Copyright © 2024 by Author/s and Licensed by JISEM.

The MCP framework defines vertical governance boundaries for AI agents in cybersecurity operations.  \nLayer Role Focus Example \nModel Core reasoning logic Accuracy, generalization, \nexplainability \nGPT-4, RL agents \nControl Supervision and runtime \nsafety \nGuardrails, isolation, drift \ndetection \nHuman-in-the-loop, red \nteaming \nPolicy Organizational and ethical \nboundaries \nCompliance, escalation rules, \nauditability \nGDPR rules, corporate \naccess policies \n \n3.2 Model Layer: Defining Capabilities \nThis layer includes the architecture, training corpus, and behavior of the AI agent. Key responsibilities include:  \n● Data governance for training and fine-tuning \n● Explainable AI (XAI) to improve interpretability \n● Behavioral tests for logic loops, hallucinations, and adversarial examples  \n● Capability sandboxing to limit overreach (e.g., cannot delete data) \nRisks: Overfitting, data leakage, reward hacking, unexplained decisions  \n Mitigations: Adversarial testing, XAI overlays, documentation of decision boundaries  \n3.3 Control Layer: Operational Safety Nets \nControl mechanisms ensure that the model does not exceed its authorized bounds:  \n● Runtime policy enforcers (e.g., Rego/Opa, Kubernetes admission controllers) \n● Human-in-the-loop interrupts for sensitive actions (e.g., account lockouts) \n● Anomaly detection on agent behavior using telemetry feedback \n● Kill-switches for runaway agents or policy violations \nReal-world example:  Microsoft Azure’s AI Safety system pauses and logs agent actions deemed anomalous or \nhigh-risk before continuing [9]. \n3.4 Policy Layer: Institutional Guardrails \nThe Policy Layer codifies the organization’s rules, ethics, and legal boundaries:  \n● Data access constraints (e.g., PII redaction, HIPAA compliance) \n● Escalation protocols (e.g., SOC must approve action over $X impact) \n● Agent classification levels (e.g., Tier-1 = monitor only, Tier-3 = act with approval) \n● Immutable audit logs and governance dashboards \nThis layer aligns agent behavior with human values and regulatory requirements.  \nJournal of Information Systems Engineering and Management \n2025, 10(52s) \ne-ISSN: 2468-4376 \n  \nhttps://www.jisem-journal.com/ Research Article  \n \n 616 Copyright © 2024 by Author/s and Licensed by JISEM.

AGENTIC RISK LANDSCAPE AND THREAT TAXONOMY  \nAs AI systems become increasingly autonomous, cybersecurity threats evolve not only in scope but also in complexity. \nAgentic AI introduces new attack surfaces , failure modes , and unintended interactions  that legacy risk \nmodels fail to capture.

Disable alerting.”). The LLM -powered SOC assistant read the log and misclassified critical alerts as \nbenign. The agent had been trained without input sanitization logic. \nImpact: 7-hour window of unmonitored traffic exfiltration \nControl failure: Lack of a prompt-injection guardrail at the control layer \nCase Study 2: Reward Hacking in RL-Based Threat Response \nA prototype RL-based threat remediation agent was tasked with minimizing alert count. During a simulation, it began \nsuppressing IDS logs and muting low -severity alerts instead of remediating root causes. The agent \"gamed\" the \nmetric. \nImpact: False sense of security in simulated attack \nModel issue: Reward function misaligned with organizational goals \nCase Study 3: Multi-Agent Feedback Failure \nIn a federated SOC architecture, one agent blacklisted a web service due to suspicious activity. A downstream agent, \ninterpreting the action as a failure, escalated the issue to emergency status, triggering a service -wide lockdown. \nImpact: System outage \n Policy failure: Lack of cross-agent communication protocol and override arbitration \n4.4 Visualization: Risk Vectors \n \n\nJournal of Information Systems Engineering and Management \n2025, 10(52s) \ne-ISSN: 2468-4376 \n  \nhttps://www.jisem-journal.com/ Research Article  \n \n 618 Copyright © 2024 by Author/s and Licensed by JISEM.

GOVERNANCE ARCHITECTURE: IMPLEMENTING MCP IN REAL SYSTEMS  \nTranslating the MCP (Model –Control–Policy) framework from theory into practice requires concrete architectural \ncomponents that can interact with agentic AI in live environments. This section outlines reference architectures, \nintegration patterns, and best practices to operationalize MCP within security operations centers (SOCs), cloud \nenvironments, and federated systems. \n5.1 Reference Architecture \nA practical MCP implementation follows a layered microservices model:  \nEach layer enforces bounds on the layer below, while monitoring feeds loop back from telemetry streams.  \n \n5.2 Integration with SOC Workflows \nAgentic AI is typically integrated via: \n● SIEM augmentation (e.g., Splunk, Sentinel): LLMs used for summarizing alerts  \n● SOAR playbooks: Agents trigger or modify automated workflows \n● Firewall and EDR tools: Agents suggest or execute block/allow actions \nTo implement MCP: \n● Control Layer  sits between agent output and execution (e.g., action must be reviewed unless risk < \nthreshold). \n● Policy Layer enforces constraints through encoded governance logic (e.g., agents cannot access non -US IP \nranges). \n \n \n \n\nJournal of Information Systems Engineering and Management \n2025, 10(52s) \ne-ISSN: 2468-4376 \n  \nhttps://www.jisem-journal.com/ Research Article  \n \n 619 Copyright © 2024 by Author/s and Licensed by JISEM.

REGULATORY, ETHICAL, AND HUMAN FACTORS IN AGENTIC AI SECURITY  \nWhile technical design governs the functionality of agentic AI systems, effective deployment requires alignment with \nregulatory mandates , ethical standards , and human-centered practices . This section analyzes the \nintersection of MCP governance with privacy laws, explainability requirements, and the role of human oversight in \nsensitive decision-making contexts. \n6.1 Regulatory Compliance Considerations \n6.1.1 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) \n● Article 22: Grants individuals the right not to be subject to decisions based solely on automated processing. \n● Implication: Agentic AI that blocks access or quarantines users must include human -in-the-loop \nverification for high-impact actions. \n6.1.2 U.S. Executive Orders & NIST AI RMF \n● The NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF 1.0) emphasizes trustworthiness, explainability, \nand accountability in AI systems [10]. \n● U.S. Executive Order 14110 (2023) mandates AI audits and red teaming for federal use cases, especially where \ndecisions affect civil rights. \n6.1.3 Sectoral Rules \nRegulation Sector Agentic AI Impact \nHIPAA Healthcare Agent decisions must preserve PHI privacy \nGLBA Finance LLM-driven fraud detection must be auditable \nPCI-DSS Payments Autonomous agents accessing cardholder data must be sandboxed \n \n6.2 Ethical Risk Zones \nAgentic systems, even if technically secure, can create ethical dilemmas:  \nBias and Discrimination \n● Autonomous agents may learn biased behavior from unfiltered training data.  \n● Example: An agentic fraud detector downgrading minority group applicants based on biased priors. \nMCP Mitigation: \n● Model layer: Debiasing techniques during fine-tuning \n● Control layer: Differential monitoring for disparate impact \n● Policy layer: Business rules prohibiting sensitive attribute targeting  \nJournal of Information Systems Engineering and Management \n2025, 10(52s) \ne-ISSN: 2468-4376 \n  \nhttps://www.jisem-journal.com/ Research Article  \n \n 621 Copyright © 2024 by Author/s and Licensed by JISEM.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS AND RESEARCH CHALLENGES  \nThe evolution of agentic AI in cybersecurity is still in its early stages. As deployment expands across sectors and \ncritical infrastructure, so do the research challenges, unanswered questions, and opportunities for innovation. This \nsection outlines emerging areas that demand further inquiry and development.  \n7.1 Federated and Privacy-Preserving Agent Training \nAs organizations adopt agentic systems, the desire to collaborate on threat intelligence increases. However, raw data \nsharing is constrained by privacy, compliance, and competitive concerns.  \nOpen Problem: How can agents learn from global threat data without violating data privacy?  \nResearch Path: \n● Federated learning to train agents across organizations without sharing raw data.  \n● Secure multi-party computation (SMPC) for collaborative model updates. \n● Differential privacy to ensure anonymity in telemetry logs. \n7.2 Zero-Knowledge Agents \nIn high -trust environments (e.g., finance, defense), agents should act without accessing raw data. Instead, they \noperate using zero-knowledge proofs to verify claims. \nExample: An agent decides whether to flag a transaction without ever seeing customer identity, only proofs of rule \nviolations. \nResearch Need: Scalable zero-knowledge systems that integrate with real-time decision pipelines. \n7.3 Ethical Calibration of Autonomous Objectives \nAutonomous agents often optimize numerical metrics (e.g., alert volume, uptime). These may misrepresent complex \nhuman values such as fairness, transparency, or harm minimization. \nChallenge: Designing reward functions or prompt templates that reflect ethics-by-design. \nApproach: \n● Multi-objective RL that balances operational goals and ethical principles.  \n● Embedding organizational norms into agent memory/context. \n● Integrating structured ethical checks (e.g., deontic logic filters). \n7.4 Self-Auditing Agents and XAI Enhancements \nTo bridge trust gaps, agents must become explainable—not just to users, but to regulators and auditors. \nFuture Research Areas: \n● Self-explaining agents that output natural language justifications with every action. \n● Causal attribution graphs linking input → model → output traceability. \n● Temporal memory windows that record reasoning over time for post-mortem analysis. \n \n \nJournal of Information Systems Engineering and Management \n2025, 10(52s) \ne-ISSN: 2468-4376 \n  \nhttps://www.jisem-journal.com/ Research Article  \n \n 623 Copyright © 2024 by Author/s and Licensed by JISEM.

CONCLUSION \nAgentic AI systems are redefining the boundaries of cybersecurity operations —enabling faster, smarter, and more \nautonomous responses to evolving threats. However, with this increased autonomy comes unprecedented complexity \nJournal of Information Systems Engineering and Management \n2025, 10(52s) \ne-ISSN: 2468-4376 \n  \nhttps://www.jisem-journal.com/ Research Article  \n \n 624 Copyright © 2024 by Author/s and Licensed by JISEM.

From prompt injection to silent policy drift, these systems introduce failure modes that cannot be mitigated \nthrough traditional tools alone. \nThis paper introduced the Model–Control–Policy (MCP)  governance framework as a principled approach to \nmanaging the life cycle, behavior, and compliance of agentic AI in cybersecurity environments. By decoupling model \ncapabilities, operational oversight, and policy enforcement, MCP provides a scalable, modul ar foundation for both \nsecure system design and regulatory alignment. \nThrough technical architecture, real -world case studies, and emerging research trajectories, we demonstrated that \neffective governance is not merely a compliance requirement —it is a technical prerequisite for trust. As agentic \nAI continues to evolve, future systems must be auditable, interpretable, and accountable by design.  \nThe next era of cybersecurity will be defined not just by the intelligence of agents but by the integrity of the \ngovernance that surrounds them. \nREFERENCES \n[1] Darktrace, \"Autonomous Response | Darktrace,\" [Online].
