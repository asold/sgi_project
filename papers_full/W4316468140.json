    "abstract": "Forest fires have continually endangered personal safety and social property. To reduce the occurrences of forest fires, it is essential to detect forest fire smoke accurately and quickly. Traditional forest fire smoke detection based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) needs many hand-designed components and shows poor ability to detect small and inconspicuous smoke in complex forest scenes. Therefore, we propose an improved early forest fire smoke detection model based on deformable transformer for end-to-end object detection (deformable DETR). We use deformable DETR as a baseline containing the best sparse spatial sampling for smoke with deformable convolution and relation modeling capability of the transformer. We integrate a Multi-scale Context Contrasted Local Feature module (MCCL) and a Dense Pyramid Pooling module (DPPM) into the feature extraction module for perceiving features of small or inconspicuous smoke. To improve detection accuracy and reduce false and missed detections, we propose an iterative bounding box combination method to generate precise bounding boxes which can cover the entire smoke object. In addition, we evaluate the proposed approach using a quantitative and qualitative self-made forest fire smoke dataset, which includes forest fire smoke images of different scales. Extensive experiments show that our improved model’s forest fire smoke detection accuracy is significantly higher than that of the mainstream models. Compared with deformable DETR, our model shows better performance with improvement of mAP (mean average precision) by 4.2%, APS (AP for small objects) by 5.1%, and other metrics by 2% to 3%. Our model is adequate for early forest fire smoke detection with high detection accuracy of different-scale smoke objects.",
