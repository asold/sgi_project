  "abstract": "The Bangla Language ranks seventh in the list of most spoken languages with 265 native and non-native speakers around the world and the second Indo-Aryan language after Hindi. However, the growth of research for tasks such as sentiment analysis (SA) in Bangla is relatively low compared to SA in the English language. It is because there are not enough high-quality publically available datasets for training language models for text classification tasks in Bangla. In this paper, we propose a Bangla annotated dataset for sentiment analysis on the ongoing Ukraine–Russia war. The dataset was developed by collecting Bangla comments from various videos of three prominent YouTube TV news channels of Bangladesh covering their report on the ongoing conflict. A total of 10,861 Bangla comments were collected and labeled with three polarity sentiments, namely Neutral, Pro-Ukraine (Positive), and Pro-Russia (Negative). A benchmark classifier was developed by experimenting with several transformer-based language models all pre-trained on unlabeled Bangla corpus. The models were fine-tuned using our procured dataset. Hyperparameter optimization was performed on all 5 transformer language models which include: BanglaBERT, XLM-RoBERTa-base, XLM-RoBERTa-large, Distil-mBERT and mBERT. Each model was evaluated and analyzed using several evaluation metrics which include: F1 score, accuracy, and AIC (Akaike Information Criterion). The best-performing model achieved the highest accuracy of 86% with 0.82 F1 score. Based on accuracy, F1 score and AIC, BanglaBERT outperforms baseline and all the other transformer-based classifiers.",
