INTRODUCTION \nOver time, power transformer s experience degradation in \ntheir insulation system which to a large extent causes tragic \nfailures which limit the proper operations of power networks \n[1], [2 ]. The degradation of solid insulation among other \ntransformer-insulating components remains the primary \ncause behind the ultimate failure of power transformers. As \na result, assessing the state of paper insulation has become \nan establish ed measure of the power transformer's health \ncondition [3]. Also, according to IEEE, the lifetime models \nof solid insulation can be used for reliability assessment and \nhealth monitoring for power transformers  [4]. The \ntransformer solid insulation which is known as the paper \ninsulation consists of extended chains of glucose rings \nforming the cellulose polymer molecule. The collective  \n \nlength of these chains is computed as the degree of \npolymerization [5]. Throughout the power transformer's \noperational life, the degree of polymerization diminishes due \nto some ageing mechanisms like oxidation, hydrolysis, and \npyrolysis [6]. Measuring the degree of polymerization \ndirectly from an insulating paper sample is a practicable \napproach. However, when it comes to a pow er transformer \nin active operation, adopting this practice involves \nundesirable disconnection and invasive handling of the unit  \n[7]. Hence, several techniques discussed later in this study \nhave been employed as an indirect measure due to the \nestablished correlations between degree of polymerization  \n(DP) and these parameters. \nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

Furthermor e, corrective and preventive \nmaintenance are the two predominant maintenance schemes \nused since the 1990s [8]. Corrective maintenance is only \nperformed after the equipment has experienced a breakdown, \nwhich results in prolonged repair durations and other \npenalties and expenses related to the equipment breakdown. \nThis type of maintenance is often referred to as failure-driven \nmaintenance. Preventive maintenance is performed on a \nroutine basis as experts make these maintenance decisions \nbased on their past kn owledge of the equipment \nmanufacturers and past breakdown and failure data. \nNevertheless, making an accurate maintenance schedule in \nadvance proves to be demanding. This makes preventive \nmaintenance to be inadequate and gradually becoming \noutdated. In rece nt times, predictive maintenance has made \nuse of predictive tools to ascertain the optimal timing when \nmaintenance actions are required. This maintenance \napproach also referred to as condition -based maintenance \ncan mitigate unexpected downtime, reduce main tenance \nexpenses, and increase the equipment's lifetime  [9], [10 ]. \nFurthermore, predictive maintenance utilizes non -invasive \ntesting methods like acoustics dissolved gas analysis (DGA), \nelectrical tests,  infrared analysis, thermodynamics, and \nvibration ana lysis to observe and estimate the trend in the \nperformance of the equipment. Data gath ering, fault \nidentification, diagnostics, and prognostics are the basic \nsteps to execute predictive maintenance. According to \nequipment degradation data, classification, regression, and \nsurvival models are three major modeling schemes for \npredictive maintenance. The classification model aims to \nforecast if a failure will take place within a specified time \nframe. The regression model aims to forecast when the \nequipment is e xpected to fail by modeling the trajectory of \nthe deterioration path. Finally, elemental concept of survival \nmodel is to address how the risk of failure evolves over time \n[9]. Figure 1 shows the classification of equipment failure \n[11] and the fault tree a nalysis of the transformer that \nconnects the system -level transformer fault with low -level \ntransformer failure is given in Figure 2 [12]. \n   Now, the emergence of machine learning (ML) presents a \npromising technique for monitoring and  assessing the \ncondition of transformer insulation degradation through its \ncapacity to understand the role of predictive maintenance  \n[13]. This learning has helped to mitigate the errors in \ncommunication and sensor malfunction by addressing the \nmissing dat a obtained from the sensor, which ensures a \nreliable predictive model  [14]. Furthermore, ML models \nprovide an effective technique for detecting, diagnosing and \npredicting transformer insulation status than the traditional \napproach [15]. Therefore, utilizin g ML techniques for \npredicting the DP correlated parameters will offer a more \ncost-effective and readily accessible method for monitoring \nthe health condition of transformers' paper insulation. \n   In this regard, this review seeks to provide researchers and \nengineers with insights into the vast potential, applications, \nand challenges associated with transformer insulation paper \nprognosis approaches. Furthermore, our goal is to aid \nresearchers in obtaining a comprehensive understanding of \nthe current and future applications, as well as the challenges, \nin the field of fault prognosis from a machine perspective. \nWe anticipate that the application of machine learning in \nfault prognosis will significantly transform maintenance \npractices of power transformer insul ation systems in the \ncoming years.  \n \nFIGURE 1.

PAPER INSULATION \nCellulose pulp served in the early days of electrical \nengineering as an insulating paper and according to [16], [17], \ncellulose insulation paper represents approximately 10% of \nthe weight of the transformer. It plays an important role as an \ninsulator used for wrapping around copper windings and as a \nmechanical/structural support in oil -immersed transformers \n[18]. Also, spacers or pressplates, and pressrings, which are \ncomponents of power transformers make use of pressboard or \npaper board [19]. Cellulose material is still utilized in power \ntransformers because of its availability, low price outstanding \ninsulation per formance when dried, and acceptable \nmechanical behaviour at high temperatures relative to \nsynthetic material, making the electrical power industry \nworldwide process several million tons of cellulose pulp into \ninsulating materials.

Bleaching of the paper is circumvented to \nincrease the content of lignin in the paper, which helps \nimprove its thermal strength and integrity  [20]. Figure 3 \nrepresents the molecular structure of cellulose  [7], [21]. \nTypically, solid insulation comprises two types of cellulose, \nwhich are thermally upgraded paper (TUP) and Kraft paper  \n[22]. TUP, which is either chemically modified or \nincorporated with additives, has been recently utilized in \npower transformers due to their excellent improvement of \nthermal stability of insulating paper. However, chemically \nmodified TUP requires extensive quantities of toxic and \nhazardous reactants, needs a distinct industrial process for the \npulping stage, and there is a decrease in the mechanical \nperformance of the insulating paper due to the replacement of \nthe hydroxyl groups. Furthermore, in addition to excellent \nthermal stability, additives incorporated in TUP are cheap and \nhave seamless integration into current industrial processes. \nHowever, it has the potential of discharging corrosive \nammonia [18]. \n   As per the GB/T29305‐2012 standard [23] for measuring \ninsulating cellulosic materials average DP for new and aged \npaper, the degree of polymerization of insulating paper is \nassessed through viscosity measurement. This involves \nutilizing positive hexane and copper ethylenediamine as the \nextractant and solvent respectively. The paper is then \nfragmented into small particles, dissolved in hexane, and \ncompletely defatted in a Sow extraction device. After drying \nin a vacuum oven, the mass of the sample is measured. \nSubsequently, the dried sample is introduced into the copper \nethylenediamine solvent, and stirred until fully dissolved \nusing a magnetic stirrer. The degree of polymerization is then \ndetermined by measuring the outflow time of the prepared \nsolution with a Ubbelohde viscometer at a temperatur e of \n20°C [7], [24]. The DP of new insulation paper is about 1000 \n– 1200 where its lifespan is approximately 180  000 h while \nthe insulation paper DP has its least value (200) at the hottest \nspot of the transformer, which is considered its end-of-useful \nlife [4], [25 ]. At this stage, the insulation paper becomes \nweak and brittle, which diminishes its insulation integrity \nand a loss of its capacity to sustain additional stresses  [26]. \nPaper with 200 DP is also considered to have lost 70% of its \ntensile streng th [27]. However, a fundamental prerequisite \nfor insulating paper pulp is to assume a concentration of \nextremely low ions of transition and primary group metals \nenabling them to possess low conductivity and ensure \nreliable performance when exposed to very high \ntemperatures [18]. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFIGURE 3. Cellulose molecular structure [7, 21]. \nA. MATHEMATICAL MODEL CONCEPT \nCellulose degradation kinetics have been developed for \nindirect evaluation of paper insulation, as the paper \ninsulation cannot be easily accessed like the insulating \nliquid. The DP of insulation paper in power transformers for \na given time can be estimated by employing the Arrhenius \nequation proposed by Emsley and Stephen model  [28], \nwhich is also known as the zero-order kinetic model [29].  \n1\n𝐷𝑃𝑡\n − 1\n𝐷𝑃0\n =𝐴𝑒− 𝐸𝑎\n𝑅𝑇  𝑡                                                   (1) \n   Where 𝐷𝑃0 and 𝐷𝑃𝑡 are the original DP for the new \ntransformer and DP value at time t, respectively, R is the gas \nconstant in J/mol/K, 𝐸𝑎 is the activation energy in Jmol−1, T \nis the hot -spot temperature in Kelvin, A in hr−1is the pre -\nexponential factor that depends on the chemical \nenvironment, and t is the time in hours  [27], [30]. A and 𝐸𝑎 \ncan be known from the plot of the logarithms of K against \nthe reciprocal of T. where K is the rate of reaction given as \n[28], [31] given as:  \n \n𝐾 = 𝐴𝑒− 𝐸𝑎\n𝑅𝑇                                                                       (2) \n  Also, a recursive form of equation (1) given as equation (3) \nwas employed in [25] to improve the accuracy of paper \ndeterioration estimation. \n1\n𝐷𝑃𝑛\n − 1\n𝐷𝑃(𝑛−1)\n =𝐴(𝑛−1)𝑒\n− \n𝐸𝑎(𝑛−1)\n𝑅𝑇(𝑛−1) .[𝑡𝑛 − 𝑡(𝑛−1)]  (3) \nWhere n is the iteration stage. \n   The author in [27] utilized the pseudo -zero-order kinetic \nequation in equation (1) to model the DP as given in equation \n(4) considering the temperature, moisture content and \noxygen level of the insulating paper. The DPn is DP after the \nageing period tn, DPn-1 is the paper DP at the end of the last \ninterval, Ea in J/mol is the activation energy, R in Jmol-1K-1 \nis the ideal gas constant, tn is time -period, and T is the \ntemperature in Kelvin. The value for A is obtained from the \noxygen level of the insulating liquid and the moisture content \nof the insulating paper as seen in [7]. \n𝐷𝑃𝑛 = \n1\n𝐴 × 𝑡𝑛 × 𝑒(−𝐸𝑎\n𝑅𝑇 )+ 1\n𝐷𝑃𝑛−1\n                                            (4)    \nFurthermore, the Arrhenius equation in equation (1) was \ndisintegrated in [32] to account for processes that involve \noxidation, pyrolysis, and hydrolysis. \n1\n𝐷𝑃(𝑡) − 1\n𝐷𝑃(𝑡𝑜) = ∑𝑘(𝑡)\n𝑡\n𝑡0\n,                                      (5) \nWhere,  \n𝑘(𝑡) \n= 𝐴𝑜𝑥𝑖(𝑡)𝑒\n− 𝐸𝑎,𝑜𝑥𝑖\n(𝜃𝐻𝑆(𝑡) +273)𝑅 + 𝐴𝑝𝑦𝑟(𝑡)𝑒\n− 𝐸𝑎,𝑝𝑦𝑟\n(𝜃𝐻𝑆(𝑡) +273)𝑅  \n+ 𝐴ℎ𝑦𝑑(𝑡)𝑒\n−\n𝐸𝑎,ℎ𝑦𝑑\n(𝜃𝐻𝑆(𝑡) +273)𝑅                                              (6) \n   The subscripts 𝑜𝑥𝑖, 𝑝𝑦𝑟, and ℎ𝑦𝑑 represent oxidation, \npyrolysis, and hydrolysis respective ly. 𝑘(𝑡) is the rate of \ndegradation.

In  [35], the authors estimated the degradation of \ninsulating paper by utilizing moisture content and \ntemperature as the ageing parameter. The influence of \noxygen was not considered as a larger number of oil -\nimmersed transformers concurrently manufactured are \nknown to be a system devoid of air (air free). \n   TUP (Nomex paper) for dry insulation also employs the \nfirst-order reaction law as seen in equation (7) to obtain its \ndegree of polymerization [36], [37]. \n1\n𝐷𝑃𝑡\n − 1\n𝐷𝑃0\n = 𝑘1\n𝑘2\n[1 − 𝑒−𝑘2𝑡]                                    (7) \n   Where 𝐷𝑃0 and 𝐷𝑃𝑡 are the Nomex paper DP at initial time \nand time t respectively, t is the ageing time, 𝑘1 and 𝑘2 are the \nrate of reaction constants. Furthermore, an improved second-\norder kinetic model i s proposed in [38] to investigate the \ninsulating paper ageing state under an axial temperature \ngradient. In [30], the authors estimate the effect of moisture, \noxygen, and hot -spot temperature on the lifespan of the \ntransformer with TUP and Kraft paper. The  result of the \nstudy considering hot-spot temperatures ranging from 50 ℃ \nto 140 ℃, and varying moisture content ranging from 0.5% \nto 5% shows that at low oxygen condition s, the paper \nlifespan is longer than at medium and high oxygen level s. \nAlso, both pape rs behave similarly with an increase in the \noxygen level. However, the result indicates that lifespan \nTUP doubles that of Kraft paper. \nIn addition, Calvini proposed the kinetics of cellulose \ndegradation as given in equation (8)  based on the inherent \nstructure of cellulose. This proposed equation suggests that \ncellulose degradation primarily involves the accumulation of \nbond scission of weak, amorphous, and crystalline links.  \n1\n𝐷𝑃𝑡\n− 1\n𝐷𝑃0\n=𝑛𝑤0(1−𝑒−𝑘𝑤𝑡)+𝑛𝑎0(1−𝑒−𝑘𝑎𝑡)+𝑛𝑐0(1−𝑒−𝑘𝑐𝑡)     (8) \nWhere 𝑛𝑡 is the number of bond scission at t, 𝑛0 is the initial \nnumber of links available for degradation, a, c, and w \nrepresent amorphous, c rystalline, and weak links \nrespectively, and all other parameters have their usual \nmeaning as earlier used [39, 40]. \nB. EXPERIMENTAL CONCEPT \nWhen estimating the DP of an insula ting paper, researchers \nhave incorporated new experimental techniques beyond \nassessing furanic compounds, oxides of carbon, ethanol, and \nmethanol levels, as discussed in our previous review paper \nin [7]. \n   The authors in [41] employed dispersion staining colours \n(DSC) as a marker to determine the ageing of insulating \npaper under accelerated thermal ageing. The cellulose fibres \nDSC was observed using dispersion staining techniques. It \nwas observed that the transition of DSCs from blue to purple \nand then to red or orange signifies an increase in the \nrefractive index of cellulose fibres obtained from the \ninsulating paper. Also, the ageing of insulating paper \nincreases with an increase in the refractive index of the \ncellulose fibre s. The proposed marker for the ageing of \ninsulating paper shows an advantage over the carbon oxides \nand 2-fulfural (2FAL) as a comparison was done with other \nworks in the study. The sugar concentration was utilized as \na marker for the degradation of cellulose-insulating paper in \n[42]. The study unveils a linear correlation between the DP \nof the paper and the logarithm of the total sugar \nconcentration. This correlation becomes particularly \npronounced during the initial stages of ageing as the total \nsugar con centration experiences a significant increase. A \nstudy in [43] reveals that the degree of polymerization of \ninsulation paper can be examined using an optical method. \nTheir experimental work and results show a significant \nenhancement over the ASTM D4243 viscometric method as \nmeasurement is said to be completed in a short duration. \nFurthermore, the ageing condition of insulation paper was \nidentified in [44] by utilizing the texture eigenvalues of the \ncaptured paper images. This was simply achieved by \ncollecting and pre -processing the images of the paper with \ndifferent thermal ageing states and subsequently estimating \nthe gray scale co -occurrence matrix for these images. The \nresulting texture eigenvalues then serve as input for the input \nlayer of the backpropagation neural network ( BPNN) used. \nIn [45], the authors estimated the ageing  condition of \ninsulating paper at the hot -spot of a transformer utilizing a \nmodified dielectric response model and reinforcement \nlearning-based optimized with genetic algorithms. Th is \nestimation is achieved by collecting the polarization and \ndepolarization currents (PDC) associated with the ageing \nstate of transformer insulation. Subsequently, the modified \ndielectric response model is introduced to express the PDC \ncharacteristics of the insulating paper. Then, the \nreinforcement learning -based genetic algorithm (RLGA) is \nused to explore optimal model parameters specified in the \nmodified dielectric model, aiming to effectively represent \nthe insulating paper ageing condition at the hot-spot. \nC. EOL ASSESSMENT \nModels for estimating insulating paper EOL in given in \nTable 1. where %LL is the percent of life lost,  𝐹𝐸𝑄𝐴 is the \nequivalent ageing factor, L is the loss of life, V is the paper \nrate of ageing, tn is the time between measurements, and LLn \nis the life lost after the time -period. The values of 𝐹𝐸𝑄𝐴, V \nand A can be computed as reported in [7]. \n \nIII. PROGNOSTICS AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT (PHM) \nPHM is a recent development that enables the tracking of the \nhealth condition of a system as a result of actual knowledge, \ndata, and information gathered from the systems and their \nelemental units to identify the onset of anomalies, isolate and \ndiagnose ongoing failures, and forecast the future health state \nof the system thereby estimating its remaining useful life \n(RUL), which enables dynamic support for maintenance  \ndecisions [51], [52 ]. PHM aids in implementing routine \nmaintenance as it enhances the system's reliability and \navailability as well as reducing the cost of maintenance [53]. \nHowever, the contemporary impediments to PHM are how \nto construct an absolute PHM system for a particular sector \nand how to convert raw signals into knowledge and \nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

Its \ncapacity to utilize the historical, current, and future data of \nequipment aids in estimating degradations, f ault \nidentification, and predictions to  effectively manage \nequipment failures. Also, it relies on sensor technologies to \ngather precise, long -term, in -situ data about health \nindicators. This information is essential for assessing \ndegradation levels and predicting RUL. The effectiveness of \nPHM deployment in enhancing system safety and \nminimizing maintenance costs is directly correlated with the \naccuracy of the collected information  [59], [60 ]. As \ndescribed in F igure 5, PHM generally consists of seven \nlayers, where the layers are further divided into three major \nstages (observe, analyse, and act) [61], [62]. Also, according \nto [63], PHM can take place in five processes, which are \npresented in Table 2. \n \n   FIGURE 4. Prognostics in PHM [56, 64]. \nTABLE 1.

PROGNOSTICS APPROACH \nIn the industrial sphere where reli ability, safety, and \nreduction in cost are highly prioritized, prognostics is a \ncrucial activity of condition -based maintenance. In this \nregard, the key prognostic objective is to provide the RUL of \ndegrading equipment, which is to forecast the time the \nequipment will no longer be competent to meet its \noperational demands and functions  [72]. The prognostic \napproach tends to examine the degree of deviation and \ndeterioration of the equipment from its anticipated normal \noperational state. The state of health o f any degrading \ncomponent is proportional to its operating time and usage. \nComprehensive degradation data of equipment as well as \nselecting an appropriate modeling method is required to \nprovide an accurate prognostic  [9]. The Prognostics \napproach as other advancing technology is faced with some \ndifficulties, which are addressed by the prognostics centre \nfor excellence. These challenges are highlighted in Table 4 \nand the questions for each of the challenges have been \njustified in  [56]. Furthermore, the progn ostics approach is \ngenerally classified into three major classes, which are the \nphysics-based, data -driven, and hybrid approaches  [73]. \nGenerally, prognostic approaches can be classified into three \nclasses and the choice for selecting any of the approaches  is \nshown in Figure 8 [56], [74]. \n \nTABLE 4. Challenges faced by the prognostics approach.  \n \nChallenges Question \nUncertainty \nmanagement \nHow can we effectively capture and \nprocess information from various \nsources of uncertainty? \nAutonomic \ncontrol \nconfiguration \nHow can local prognostic information \nbe converted into changes at the \ncontroller level to ensure long-term \nsatisfaction of the controller \nobjectives? \nIntegration How can we appropriately merge and \nprocess information from various \ninteracting subsystems? \nValidation and \nverification of \nprognostics \nHow can we validate the accurate \nfunctioning of prognostic algorithms, \nespecially when applied to new \nsystems? \nPost-prognostic \nreasoning \nHow can data from a prognostic \nreasoner be translated into actionable \nsteps, considering additional factors \nlike logistics, mission details, and \nfleet management? \n \n \n \nFIGURE 8. Selection decision for prognostics approach.  \nA. PHYSICS-BASED MODEL APPROACH \nThis approach sets up a mathematical model that directly \nlinks the physical processes that govern the equipment's \nhealth. It could be semi -empirical and mechanistic \nrepresenting the grey box model and white box model \nrespectively [75].  Dynamic systems like differential \nequations, nonlinear equations, and state space models are \nsolved appropriately to characterize the m odel. However, \nbuilding physics -based models for complex systems is \ndifficult as essential knowledge of the material \ncharacteristics, failure mechanisms, and operation \nconditions, and degradation of physical phenomena is \nusually unknown [68], [76], [77]. In addition, physics-based \napproaches cannot be generalized as they are specific to \ncertain applications [72], [78]. The physics-based approach \nrefers to high fidelity simulation, differential equations, and \nfinite element models [64]. \nB. DATA-DRIVEN APPROACH \nData-driven models also known as black box models are \nderived from condition monitoring data collected regularly, \nwhich aids in the learning of system behaviours rather than  \ndeveloping extensive human expertise and system physics \nmodels [75], [79 ], [80 ]. In data -driven approaches, a \npredictive model is created by training data and the \nvalidation of the model is achieved by testing data. This \napproach is effortlessly executed as it builds on historical \naccounts to predict output with regard to condition -\nmonitored data  [81]. Also, it employs interpolation, \nextrapolation, and ML for prediction  [81]. However, this \napproach offers less accurate outputs  compared to the \nphysics-based model [72]. Also, the potential for this \napproach to account for uncertainties is limited  [51], [60]. \nThe classification and methodology for a data -driven model \nare illustrated in Figures 9 and 10 respectively [9], [56], [58] \nand Table 5 highlights some o f the pros and cons of the \ndifferent classes of data-driven models. \nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

Classification of data-driven model. \n \n \nFIGURE 10. Methodology for data-driven model. \n \nC. HYBRID APPROACH \nThe hybrid approach integrat es physics-based models and \ndata-driven approaches. The former offers offline validation \nof the physical model while the latter is used to increase \naccuracy by updating the parameters of the model [72]. This \napproach provides understandable results as it utilizes the \nadvantages of the two approaches to accomplish finely tuned \nprognostics models that possess an excellent ability to handle \nuncertainties from many sources leading to accurate \nevaluation of RUL [134]. This is easily achievable as data is \nemployed to compensate for the absence of knowledge [64]. \nFurthermore, this approach can be modeled in three ways, \nwhich are the series approach, parallel approach and parallel-\nseries approach [61], [135]. Chao et al. [136] utilized hybrid \napproaches, leveraging the advantages of both physics-based \nand data -driven models for accurate prognostics. Physics -\nbased models, which entail deducing unobservable model \nparameters associated with the health of a system's \ncomponents through the resolution of a calibration problem \namalgamated with sensor readings generated by commercial \nmodular aero -propulsion system simulation (CMAPSS), \nwhich then serve as inputs for the deep neural network \n(feedforward neural network ( FNN), convolutional neural \nnetwork ( CNN), long short -term memory ( LSTM)) used. \nThe performance of the proposed hybrid method was \nassessed by comparing it with an alternative data -driven \nmethod where sensor data solely serves as input to three \ndistinct types of deep neural networks ( multilayer \nperceptron-feedforward neural network ( MLP-FNN), \nrecurrent neural network ( RNN), CNN). It was then \nobserved that the prediction horizon increased  by \napproximately 127%. Furthermore, the proposed hybrid \nmethod surpasses the data -driven approaches with an \noutstanding RUL estimation amidst highly varia ble \noperating conditions and an incomplete representation of the \ntraining dataset.

PROGNOSTICS DATA ANALYSIS \nPrognostic degradation models usually need a precise and \nextensive historical degradation signal database. These \nsignals help to identify degradation trends essential for \npredicting lifespan. However, for practical applications in \nreal-world scenarios, the se degradation signals often have \nmissing observations, making it challenging to identify a  \nsuitable degradation model when there is a significant \namount of missing data. Also, the data collected from several \nsensors may have different scale and numerical ranges which \ncould remarkably influence the convergence speed and \nprediction accuracy  [86].  Therefore, studies have been \nperformed in this line to manage these issues by developing \nsome approaches to mitigate these issues. Some ways of pre-\nprocessing data obtained from sensors are presented in Table \n8. \nA. ADDRESSING IMBALANCE DATA \nIn [139], the authors employed semi -parametric techniques \nto create a prognostic degradation model for data that are \ninsufficient and fragmented. In their techniques, functional  \nprincipal component analysis (FPCA), which is a non -\nparametric functional data analysis method that helps to \nidentify crucial patterns of variation in functional data was \nutilised to recognise the principal features of the insufficient \nsignal. FPCA can of fer a concise and low -dimensional \nrepresentation of each curve by condensing it into a set of \nscores known as functional principal components scores \n(FPC-scores), which are signal features. However, this \ntechnique cannot be applied for multiple failure mod es, as it \nis limited to a single failure mode application. Also, the \ntechnique can only utilize observation from a single sensor, \nwhich can limit the practical application of the techniques as \nmultiple sensors are employed in system monitoring. The \nauthors in [140] extract valuable and irrelevant information \nfrom sensor data utilizing the principal component analysis \n(PCA), which is then linked with an auto -associative neural \nnetwork (AANN) for classification. Furthermore, PCA \nrequires linear or non-linear dependency among the observed \nvariables. This makes it effective when there is the existence \nof either linear or non -linear correlation among sets of \nmeasurement vectors, unlike Pearson correlation coefficient \n(PCC) which only has linear dependency among the \nobserved variables [141]. \nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

MODEL EVALUATION METRICS \nSeveral researchers have proposed and developed different \nalgorithms and have utilized different assessment metrics for \ntheir proposed models. Among others, the most popular \nperformance assessment metrics used are mean square error \n(MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute \nerror (MAE), scoring function (SF), mean absolute \npercentage error (MAPE), relative absolute erro r (RAE), \nsymmetric mean absolute error (SMAPE), root mean \nsquared logarithmic error (RMSLE), and coefficient of \ndetermination (R2), which are expressed as follows. \n \n𝑀𝑆𝐸= 1\n𝑁∑(𝑦̂𝑖 − 𝑦𝑖)2\n𝑁\n𝑖=1\n                                               (10) \n𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸= √1\n𝑁∑(𝑦̂𝑖 − 𝑦𝑖)2\n𝑁\n𝑖=1\n                                        (11) \n𝑀𝐴𝐸= 1\n𝑁∑|𝑦̂𝑖 − 𝑦𝑖|\n𝑁\n𝑖=1\n                                                 (12) \n𝑅𝐴𝐸 =100 × \n∑ |𝑦̂𝑖 − 𝑦𝑖|𝑛\n𝑖=1\n∑ |𝑦̂𝑖 − 𝑦̅|𝑛\n𝑖=1\n                                    (13) \n𝑀𝐴𝑃𝐸= 1\n𝑁∑\n|𝑦̂𝑖 − 𝑦𝑖|\n|𝑦𝑖|\n𝑁\n𝑖=1\n                                             (14) \n𝑆𝑀𝐴𝑃𝐸 = 1\n𝑁 ∑2|𝑦̂𝑖 − 𝑦𝑖|\n|𝑦̂𝑖| + |𝑦𝑖|\n𝑁\n𝑖=1\n                                        (15) \n𝑅2 =1 − \n∑ (𝑦̂𝑖  − 𝑦𝑖)2𝑁\n𝑖=1\n∑ (𝑦̂𝑖  − 𝑦̅)2𝑁\n𝑖=1\n                                             (16) \n𝑆𝐹= \n{\n \n \n \n ∑(𝑒+ 𝑦̂𝑖 − 𝑦𝑖\n10   − 1), 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑦̂𝑖 − 𝑦𝑖 ≥0  \n𝑁\n𝑖=1\n∑(𝑒− 𝑦̂𝑖  − 𝑦𝑖\n13   − 1), 𝑓𝑜𝑟\n𝑁\n𝑖=1\n 𝑦̂𝑖 − 𝑦𝑖 <0\n   (17) \n𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐿𝐸 =√∑ [𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝑦̂𝑖 +1) − 𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝑦𝑖 +1)]2𝑁\n𝑖=1\n𝑁    (18) \nWhere N represents the number of samples or u nits used as \nthe input. 𝑦𝑖 is the real or actual value, 𝑦̂𝑖 is the predicted \nvalue, and 𝑦̅ =\n1\n𝑁∑ 𝑦𝑖\n𝑁\n𝑖=1  is the average value of 𝑦𝑖 [9], [86], \n[103], [107], [127], [145]- [148]  A smaller value of RMSE \nand MAPE signifies more accurate predictions with reduced \nerrors.

PAPER DEGRADATION PARAMETERS \nAgeing of the paper insulation is an irreversible rupturing of \ncovalent and hydrogen bonds within and between the \ncellulose polymer chains. This degradation results from the \ncombined influences of pyrolysis, oxidation and hydrolysis \nreactions, which are predominantly governed by \ntemperature, reactive oxygen species and moisture \nrespectively. \nA. TEMPERATURE AND AGEING \nPaper insulation's thermal stability has drawn numerous \nresearchers' attention as power transformers operate at high \ntemperatures while a lifetime of about 40 years is expected. \nPaper with a higher content of lignin exhibits thermal \nstability as it can produce highly condensed structures during \nthermal decomposition  [18]. Pyrolytic degradation arises \nsolely from elevated temperatures. Its activation energy is \nabout 1.4 to 2 times greater than that of hydrolysis. Above \n130 °C, pyrolysis becomes t he predominant degradation \nprocess and it transited into a self -accelerated reaction at a \ntemperature of 140  ℃ due to the generation of water and \noxygen [47]. Temperature increase can lead to increasing \noverheating and conductivity, which causes localized \ncarbonization of the insulating paper [151]. Furthermore, the \ninsulating paper extracted from the uppermost part of the \nwinding has the lowest DP values due to temperature \ndifference [152]. The primary factor governing the RUL of \nthe insulation p aper is the hot -spot temperature as it \ninfluences the acceleration production of furans, moisture, \nCO, and CO 2 that could lead to direful breakdown during \nhigh loading conditions  [47], [153 ]. However, \nunderestimation of the hot -spot temperature has been a \ncommon practice as the estimation of the hot -spot \ntemperature is complex, which could cause the power \nequipment to operate at a reduced cooling system  [154]. \nFollowing IEEE C57.91 guidelines, the evaluation of \ninsulating paper loss -of-life is based on the hot-spot \ntemperature experienced during a specific period of power \ntransformer operation. This methodology is predicated on \nthe understanding that heat predominantly drives the ageing \nprocess and presumes that the levels of acidity and humidity \nwithin the insulation system remain unchanged [155]. \n   The Arrhenius equation is broadly recognized as a standard \nmodel for describing the ageing process of insulating paper.  \nThe model given in equation (19 ) employs temperature as \nthe only parameter influencing insulating paper degradation. \n1\n𝐷𝑃(𝑡) − 1\n𝐷𝑃(𝑡𝑜) = 𝐴∆𝑡𝑒\n− 𝐸𝑎\n𝑅(𝜃𝐻𝑆(𝑡) +273)              (19) \nWhere 𝐸𝑎 in Jmol−1 is the ageing reaction activation energy, \n𝑅 in Jmol−1K−1 is the gas constant, 𝐴 is the pre-exponential \nfactor whose outcome is dependent upon the chemical \nenvironment, ∆𝑡 is the ageing period, 𝜃𝐻𝑆 in ℃ is the \ninsulating paper temperature (hot -spot temperature). 𝐷𝑃(𝑡) \nand 𝐷𝑃(𝑡𝑜) are the DP at the end 𝑡 and start 𝑡𝑜 respectively \n[47]. A post-mortem analysis was carried out in [156] which \nvalidated that the parameters  𝐸 and 𝐴 in equation (19 ) lack \nthe required precision for evaluating insulating paper DP as \nthey do not report for the influences of oxygen, moisture, and \nacidity. In [157], several values 𝐴 in hour−1 are presume in \nequation (19 ) to be either hydrolysis or oxidation pre -\nexponential factor values that depend on 𝜃𝐻𝑆 value. Also, in \nthis work, a steady state equation is proposed for hot -spot \ntemperature and it is expressed as: \n𝜃𝐻𝑆 = 𝜃𝐴 + 𝜃𝑇𝑂 + 𝐻𝑆𝐹×𝜃𝑂𝑊                       (20)   \nWhere 𝜃𝐻𝑆 is the hot -spot temperature, 𝜃𝐴 is the ambient \ntemperature, 𝜃𝑇𝑂 is the temperature of the top oil , and 𝜃𝑂𝑊 \nis the oil -to-winding temperature gradien t under rated load. \nThe HSF is the hot -spot factor. The transformer HSF value \ncharacterizes the additional temperature increase in the \nwindings above the top winding temperature, primarily due \nto the increased eddy current losses at the top of the winding. \nThe HSF-specific value depends on a variety of design and \nmanufacturing factors and can be determined accurately by \ndirectly measuring the winding 𝜃𝐻𝑆 using fibre optic sensors. \nHowever, this technique is typically feasible only in new \ntransformers. Consequently,  when no calculations or test \ndata are available,  an HSF value o f 1.3 for power \ntransformers is suggested by IEC loading guidelines [158]. \nThe increase in the ho t-spot temperature over the \ntemperature of the top -oil after a step load change has been \ndocumented as a time-dependent function influenced by the \nduration and the load of the transformer, which is referred to \nas an overshoot time -dependent function. The m odeling of \nthis overshoot phenomenon led to the introduction of a \nmathematical representation based on observed data in the \nIEC 600076-7 loading guide [49], and a graphical illustration \ncomparing this overshoot based on the IEC 600076-7 model \nwith the real transformer with forced and natural cooling can \nbe seen in  [159]. Also, this overshoot is reported to be \nunobservable with the IEEE Clause 7 loading guide model \nbut observed when employing the IEEE Annex G model as \nit utilizes the physics -based modeling t hat incorporates the \nimpact of viscosity and DC variation, stray and eddy losses \nwith temperature. Generally, the IEEE C57:91 Clause 7, IEC \n60354, and IEC 60076-7 loading guide for dynamic thermal \nmodels are accurately presented in [160] and are commonly \nutilized in several applications because their models \nnecessitate only fundamental input parameters that can be \nobtained from a standard transformer heat-run test report. \n     A dynamic model was proposed in [161] for evaluating \nthe hot-spot temperature 𝜃𝐻𝑆 as the temperature distribution \nwithin a power transformer is not uniform.

According to their study, it was reported \nthat standalone mechanical ageing has minimal impact on \nthe ageing of insulation paper compared to combined \nmechanical-thermal ageing, which has a significant effect on \nthe paper. Furthermore, the ageing process in combined \nmechanical-thermal ageing aligns with thermal ageing where \nthe insulation paper functional group remain constant as \nageing is initiated with the breakage of the paper glyc osidic \nbond. However, based on the degradation process of \ncellulose under various ageing conditions, it is evident that \nthermal stress remains the principal ageing factor, with \nelectrical and mechanical stresses acting as accelerating \nfactors for ageing [39].   \nB. MOISTURE AND AGEING \nThe presence of moisture in oil -immersed transformers is \nmajorly a result of the ageing of insulation paper and due to \nits high dielectric strength, it represents a crucial factor \naffecting insulation reliability  [167]. Therefore, paper \ninsulation is vulnerable when the moisture content exceeds 3 \n% and failure  is anticipated if it exceeds 4 % [151]. Studies \nindicate that the rate of degradation at stand ard service \ntemperatures, with 4 % moisture in the paper, is 20 times \nhigher than at 0.5 % [168]. Also, the mechanical strength of \nan insulating paper has been reported to diminish by halve \nwhen the level of moisture in the paper is doubled  [118]. \nGenerally, the process of degradation of insulating paper \noccurs in the presence of moisture at 70 ℃ – 130 ℃ [32].  To \nmaintain dielectric strength and prolong ageing, it is essential \nto keep the moisture content below 0.5 % and 20 ppm in the \npaper and oil respectively [16]. The potential cellulose \nhydrolysis degradation, reaction types, reactants, and \nproducts are presented in Table 9. The conventional \ntechniques utilized in detecting and measuring water content \nare the Karl Fisher titration, spectroscopic frequency-domain \ntechnique, spectroscopic time -domain techniques, electrical \ntechniques and paper adsorption isotherms for insulating \npaper [7], [169], [170]. The mentioned techniques often lead \nto the overestimation of paper water content. In addition, the \nadsorption and desorption of moisture in the insulating paper \noscillate around an equilibrium point or within a specific \nrange. However, [33] explores an improved approach for \nassessing the moisture content in transformer paper, which is \nbased on cellulose isotherms. This technique lies in its ability \nto circumvent the requirement for thermodynamic \nequilibrium between transformer oil and cellulosic \ninsulation. Instead, it employs cyclic temperature variations \nto ascertain shifts in the direction of water migration whether \ninto or out of the insulating liquid. These alterations in water \nmigration direction offer a means to determine the vapour \npressure of water absorbed by cellulose. Therefore, water \nactivity probes can be employed to measure the temperature \nand water activity of the insulating liquid around its tip \npoints, which reduces the uncertainties due to the condition \nof the liquid and non -equilibrium conditions  [171]. To \nestimate the water concentration on insulating paper, the hot-\nspot temperature of the winding insulation should be \nconsidered as the temperature of the winding insulating \npaper is usually higher than the temperature of the insulating \nliquid. Furthermore, the use of a water activity probe can \noverestimate the water concentration on th e paper as paper \nreleases moisture into the insulating liquid when it is being \nheated up. As such, the difference in the temperature of the \nhot-spot position and the water activity probe should be \nnoted. IEC 60076/7 thermal model [172], and the installation \nof an optical sensor close to the winding hot-spot can be used \nto determine this temperature difference. Also, the position \nof the water activity probes should be considered as the water \nactivity estimation is affected by the speed of the circulating \nliquid. In this regard, the water activity probe should be \nplaced at the region where the liquid has the highest speed  \n[173]. Also, the dielectric response techniques typically \nprovide data that aligns with online probe data but have the \ndrawback of requiring complete isolation of the transformer \nfrom the grid [171]. Furthermore, a capacitive sensor, which \nis more sensitive to water and has no response to other \ninsulating liquid molecules has been currently employed. \nHowever, for optimum data collection, the l ocation to place \nthis sensor remains a problem. Therefore, it is imperative that \nthe sensor is placed to avoid areas with stagnant oil as it \nexclusively sensitive to the insulating liquid at the surface  \n[22]. Furthermore, the authors in [170] proposed a sy stem \nutilizing high-frequency sensors to access the deterioration \nof transformer insulation by measuring water concentration, \nwhere an artificial neural network ( ANN) model is used to \noptimize the traditional coaxial probe technique used.  \nIn [47], an empirical expression that establishes the \nrelationship between paper moisture content, hot -spot \ntemperature, and insulating oil moisture content is given in \nequation (38 ) under the assumption of equilibrium \nconditions. This expression is known as ABB’s equation. \n𝐻𝑝 =2.06915𝑒−0.0297𝜃𝐻𝑆 × (𝐻0)0.4089𝜃𝐻𝑆\n0.09733\n        (38)  \nWhere 𝐻0 in ppm is the humidity of the insulating oil, and \n𝐻𝑝 in % is the insulating paper moisture content. In [174], a \nnovel and easily accessible technique was used to estimat e \nthe oil -immersed insulating paper moisture content. This \ntechnique involves the creation of an frequency domain \nspectroscopy (FDS) curve database that is being facilitated \nby employing an exponential decay model. The moisture \ncontent of insulating liquid -impregnated paper is measured \nin [175] by establishing a nonlinear coefficient α (feature \nparameter) of the U -I per -unit curve, which has a directly \nproportional relationship with moisture content and an \ninversely proportional relationship with the excita tion \nfrequency. In [117], the moisture content in an oil-immersed \npolymer paper insulation was predicted by employing \nsupport vector machine (SVM) with genetic algorithm (GA) \nto optimize SVM key parameters. The result shows that the \nmodel is a potential and robust tool for an oil -immersed \npolymer insulation moisture content prediction. BPNN \nenhanced with AdaBoost algorithms was proposed in [1] to \naddress the unreliable evaluat ion of moisture content. \nAdaBoost was used for optimization due to its ability to \nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

OXYGEN AND AGEING \nThe chemical reaction between oxygen and the hydrocarbons \nof any insulating liquid causes deterioration in terms of \noxidation and ageing of the liquid which leads to the \nformation of compounds like acids, sludge, water, and gases \nas presented in Table 10 with their corresponding effects  \n[182], [183 ]. Also, the DGA results involving about 1.5 \nmillion samples based on IEEE C57.104 -2019 standard \nrevealed that the O 2/N2 ratio is a prominent parameter that \nexerts a remarkable influence on the typical gas levels \ndetected irrespective of the insulating liquid volume, rating, \nand voltage class. Therefore, the ratio of O2/N2 was proposed \nfor assessment as an indicator to diff erentiate free-breathing \nfrom sealed units. Figure 11 shows transformer classification \nbased on O2/N2 ratio  [184]. Oxygen, being one of the factors \ncontributing to ageing, demands careful consideration as it \ndecreases the ageing by a factor of 16 when its content in the \ninsulating liquid is reduced from 30000 ppm to 300 ppm  \n[185]. Therefore, the nitrogen-sealed type, diaphragm-sealed \ntype conservators, and the use of oxidation inhibitors have \nbeen utilized by researchers to provide a solution as the \nremoval of dissolved oxygen from transformer -insulating \nliquid is not optional but imperative. \nOxidative degradation of cellulose paper is primarily \ninitiated by ions of transition metal rather than primary metal \ngroup ions. In the presence of water and oxygen, they \ncatalyze the formation of hydroxyl anions, hydroxyl radicals, \nand several other reactive oxygen species. Despite electrical \nengineers' preeminent endeavours to eliminate metal ions, \noxygen, and water within the system, these parameters \nremain in trace  quantities and are ready to instigate a \ndetrimental cycle of paper degradation  [8], [186 ]. \nFurthermore, the presence of oxygen accelerates the process \nof paper degradation by increasing its rate by a factor of 2.5  \n[185]. This was confirmed as an experimen t on accelerated \nageing at 130 ℃ with and without oxygen  was reported in  \n[182], which reveals the ageing of paper insulation was \ndecelerated by inhibiting access to oxygen. Oxidation of \npaper insulation results in an increase in acidity as a reaction \ntakes place between oxygenated insulating liquid and the \npaper. This process is most notable at temperatures below \n60 ℃ – 75 ℃, indicating that in an unloaded power \ntransformer, acidity is the primary degradation of insulating \npaper. As such, thermally upgraded  paper doesn’t offer any \nbenefit over non -thermally upgraded paper when \nconsidering oxidation as a degradation factor  [47]. Oxygen \nas one of the parameters for insulating paper degradation has \nbeen integrated and captured in other parameters such as \nmoisture and temperature. Nowadays, most of the new and \nwidely used transformers produced are air -free called the \nhermetically sealed unit, making it a less-prominent factor to \nbe considered by researchers among others.  \n \nFIGURE 11.

INSULATING LIQUID CONDITION AND AGEING \nDGA technology stands out as a crucial and efficient tool for \ndetecting early -stage faults in oil -immersed power \ntransformers.

This \ntechnology based on conventional diagnostics techniques \nsuch as the Rogers ratio, IEC three -ratio t echnique, and \nmodified three-ratio technique suffers some limitations like \nincomplete ratio coding and limited usage conditions  [188], \n[189]. The relationship between some ageing parameters and \nDP is presented in Figures 12 and 13 (a) to (g). [190]. Also, \nsome comparison models between 2FAL and DP and some \ntransformer ageing models have been highlighted in  [191]. \nFurthermore, a careful study of several researchers' work \nresults has shown different values of DP for the same ageing \nparameter and ins ulating liquid as seen in Fig ure 14. This \nmay be due to the inaccuracy and incapacity of the \nmathematical models to correlate the degree of \npolymerization with each individual dissolved gas. \nFurthermore, IEEE C5 7.104-2019 [184] and IEC 60599 -\n2015 [192] have pr oposed some DGA interpretation \ntechniques, which have been generally accepted by electrical \nindustries. However, accurate results from the analysis can \nonly be obtained if the observed gases relate closely to the \ncondition of the equipment as gas data alwa ys show a non -\nlinearity characteristic. Furthermore, DGA suffers some \nlimitations such as incorrect collection of samples, \nuncommon causes of gas generation, several phenomena \nhappening concurrently, accelerations and rate of gas \ngeneration which serves as  the most reliable basis requires \nmultiple measurements to be conducted over time, and the \ngas formation pattern and rate characterization is not always \nadequate to determine the gas generation source  [184]. \nGenerally, both offline and offline techniques f or DGA \nsuffer the limitations of inability to classify some fault \nespecially when the DGA results do not fall within the \nIEEE/IEC specifications, leading to ambiguity in the \nanalysis and it is not appropriate for an air -cooled \ntransformer [15], [193]. Therefore, to enhance the accuracy \nand efficiency of fault identification methods in oil -\nimmersed transformers using DGA, researchers globally \nhave explored the integration of various ML techniques, \nwhich have been investigated as a new solution for assessing \nfault conditions by amalgamating parameters like gas levels, \ngas rates, and DGA interpretations  [194]. Also, \nincorporating ML approaches with the DGA \nchromatographic method will help to overcome the \nimpediments in employing standalone DGA -based \ntechniques [195]- [197].  \nA self-learning technique was presented in [190] to evaluate \nthe DP of insulating paper according to multiple insulating \nliquid ageing parameters. The authors utilized the FCM -LR \nmethod to forecast the DP of insulating paper employing \nseveral ageing parameters. The report in this study confirms \nthat DP value prediction using multiple parameters is more \naccurate than a single parameter. Also, the better \nperformance exhibited by the fuzzy C mean-linear regression \n(FCM-LR) method positions it as a robust tool for accurately \nevaluating the DP value of insulation paper. The authors in \n[198] utilized some ageing parameters present in the \ninsulating liquid of 108 power transformers to determine the \nexpected life estimation and condition of insulating paper by \nbuilding an ANFIS for the DP of insulating paper. The input \nparameters considered are acidity, interfacial tension, CO, \nCO2, and colour. The result presented shows that the ANFIS \nmodel has 85.75% and 89.07% accuracy in test ing and \ntraining respectively. Also, the proposed model can be \nutilized to evaluate the paper condition when the 2FAL data \nof the power transformer is not obtainable. In  [102], a \ncombined model based on kernel principal component \nanalysis ( KPCA) and a generalized regression neural \nnetwork (GRNN) utilizing an enhanced fly fruit optimization \nalgorithm (FFOA) to select t he smoothing factor parameter \nin the GRNN network was used to predict the concentration \nof dissolved gases in an aged insulating liquid. The F FOA \noptimization techniques were employed to overcome the \nlimitation associated with the neural network approach by \naiding the adjustment of training parameters. The proposed \nmodel in this study demonstrates superior data fitting and \nmore accurate predicti on capabilities relative to the grey \nmodel (GM) and the SVM. The authors in [199] employ the \nSVM classifier model to assess the insulation condition of \ninsulation paper impregnated in insulating liquid. 149 \ntransformers were considered and some dielectric properties, \nfuranic and dissolved gas analysis compounds were used as \nmeasurement data. Also, 19 t ransformers whose furan data \nwere unreachable were considered. After feature extraction \nand selection were done, the model was observed to have an \naccuracy of 90.63%. This implies that the model was able to \nmake 29 correct classifications out of 32 based on healthy, \nmoderate, and extensive state categories. In  [200], ANN, \nGaussian process regression ( GPR), SVM, and least-square \nsupport vector regression (LSSVM) algorithms were used to \npredict the dissolved gas employing grey relational analysis \n(GRA) to estimate the grey relational coefficients for \ndissolved gas feature selection, coupled with GPR for \npredicting the dissolved gas values. The test was carried out  \nwith eight datasets of dissolved gases. Their results after \ncomparison show that the GRA technique is efficient in \nidentifying and eliminating extraneous and redundant \nfeatures from the original feature sets. The content of \ndissolved gases in insulating l iquid was forecasted using \nsupport vector regression ( SVR), which is an amplified \nedition of the SVM technique in [201]. SVR is considered in \nthis study due to its accuracy, simple structure, and good \ngeneralization performance as it is founded on the principle \nof reducing structural risk rather than empirical risk.

In  \n[202], the authors proposed a new asset management \ntechnique for power transformer insulating liquid by \nutilizing online DGA data. Their proposed model consists of \ntwo different submodules, which are fa ult diagnostics and \nlife management modules, these two modules were made to \nundergo a training process using the CNN machine learning \nframework. The former utilized the six main types of fault \nthat can be analysed using the DGA approach, while the \nlatter u tilized the RUL of the insulating paper as the life \nexpectancy of the power transformer principally depends on \npaper insulation. LSTM was considered in this work based \non its suitability to predict long -term non -linear sequence \nproblems through gating mech anisms. Also, to enhance the \nprediction accuracy, Bayesian optimization algorithm \n(BOA) was employed to optimize the model \nhyperparameters. The proposed LSTM prediction result \nshows superior prediction accuracy as it was compared with \nthe prediction of GM,  SVM, and BPNN. Three data -driven \nmodels, which are ANN, SVM, and Gaussian Bayesian \nnetwork (GBN) are used to diagnose the dissolved gases to \nmonitor the transformer health state in  [123]. The dataset \nclassifiers were trained and tested through Monte Carlo  \ncross-validation, which is to allow estimation for statistical \nclassifiers. The result indicates that ANN model emerges as \na more accurate diagnostic method than SVM and GBN, \nwhere GBN model is observed to have the lowest accuracy. \nHowever, information de rived from the results of  GBN \nmodels proves to be more valuable as it was able to generate \nthe probability density function ( PDF) with uncertain \ninformation. This helps to represent the initial and final \nhealth states, which delineate the uncertainty that is linked \nwith these states. Furthermore, the authors suggested that \nGBN model trained with dissolved gas samples should offer \nconfident predictions for known data and also should be able \nto express uncertainty when faced with unseen dissolved gas \nsample d ata. As such, the uncertainty formation can be \nemployed to refine and enhance the accuracy of the model in \nthe real-world applications. The authors in [203] integrated \nfuzzy logic and adaptive neuro -fuzzy inference system \n(ANFIS) to forecast the remnant li fe cycle of oil -immersed \ntransformer by utilizing the concentration of 2FAL and the \ndegree of polymerization of insulating cellulose paper. Three \nmodels (De Pablo, Chendong, and Vaurchex models) \nrelating DP was employed and ANFIS was considered  as it \nprovides remarkable good learning ability. The ANFIS \nmodel on the testing data was reported to have to offer a \n99.86% accuracy indicating the model prediction capability. \nThe summary of several machine learning models use for \nageing parameters prediction with t he evaluation metrics \nused is presented in Table 11. \n \n \nFIGURE 12.

DISCUSSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS \nAmong researchers and industries around the globe, the \noperation of ML technologies and their applications have \nbecome widespread as they provide solutions to numerous \nindustrial difficulties. In this regard, they can substitute \nclassical prognostic and diagnostic techniques leading to \nsmart monitoring systems  [211]. It is g enerally \nacknowledged that the effective selection of features \nsignificantly influences the performance of models as \nnearly all models invest a substantial amount of time and \ncomputational resources in the process of feature selection. \nTherefore, automatic  feature extraction should be looked \ninto as a scope for researchers. Furthermore, parameters, \nbeing the foundation of every ML algorithm should be \nconsidered as a penalty factor and the learning rate is the \nonly parameter tuned to achieve better results.  Following \nthis, other imperative parameters should be explored for \ntuning to enhance the model's performance.  \n   The sensor, which is a micro-electro-mechanical system \noperating within the same environment as the equipment, \nis anticipated to undergo degradation with time. Therefore, \nconsidering the critical role of precise information in \npredicting the health condition of power transformers \ninsulating paper and making informed decisions thereafter. \nIt is imperative to carefully account for the impact of \nsensor degradation and to actively manage and address the \ndegradation of these sensors as differentiating sensor \ndegradation from that of the main component will be \nnecessary to precisely assess the health condition of the \ncomponent at specific intervals.  \n   An attention -based model like the transformer model \nallows the model to identify, prioritize, and concentrate on \nthe most crucial features in the input by enabling them to \nassign importance to each input element while generating \nthe output, thereby elim inating the constraint of gradient \nvanishing when handling long-term sequences. Therefore, \nthis recent neural network architecture model can be \nemployed in transformer insulation paper health prognosis \nas it is rarely used in this field. Furthermore, data obtained \nfrom power transformers encounters consequential \nbackground noise that is not connected to faults, this could \npose some challenges in isolating fault -related features \nleading to inadequacy of accurate prediction. Therefore, \npriority should be placed on the identification of key fault \nsignals by utilizing the attention mechanisms. Also, a \nvariety of multiple kernel function types and employing \ndifferent optimization algorithms can be explored to \nenhance prediction performance.  \n   The intricate stru cture of power transformers may pose \nchallenges in identifying the most suitable locations for \nsensors to accurately capture degradation signals for \ninsulation systems. Therefore, a future study can focus on \nresearching the optimal sensor placement methods , which \ncould probably be achieved through simulation and some \nmodeling methods. Also, the new approach can be \nautomated and integrated into upcoming online condition \nmonitoring sensors for power equipment, providing real -\ntime insights into the status of paper insulation.  \n   Probabilistic operations warranted for energy reliability \nevaluation and diagnostics (POWERED), which is a \nmachine learning or hybrid artificial intelligence tool to \ndiagnose and predict the RUL of power transformers have \nbeen presente d in some studies. This system can be \nintegrated with physics -based machine learning to aid \naccurate prediction of the health and status of a transformer \ninsulation system. Also, t he authors proposed the \ndevelopment of software that will serve as a valuabl e \nresource for the transformer insulation condition \nmonitoring community, where a standardized platform \nwill be created for engineers and researchers to simulate \nthe behaviour and operation of the transformer insulation \nsystem. Furthermore, this will be ab le to provide \nresearchers with the platform to compare and benchmark \ntheir algorithms through the provision of datasets for \ntransformer insulation system health monitoring and \nprognostics. \n \nVIII. CONCLUSION \nIncorporating prognostics for power equipment holds the \npromise of substantially enhancing equipment \nmanagement within the power industry as the volume of \ndata obtained from power equipment increases with a \nreduced cost of sensors and storage. Online prog nostics \nhelp to predict the future health state of a given equipment \nand present distinct advantages relative to total \ndependence on the judgement of an expert. However, the \nprimary challenge in maintenance tasks for power \ntransformers is conducting failur e analysis for each \ncomponent. Therefore, in this study, from the perspective \nof machine learning, the prediction of power transformer \ninsulation paper is reviewed, challenged, and prospected. \nThe methods of estimation of the degree of polymerization \nof in sulating paper were introduced, and the prognostics \napproaches and how it is being done are summarized. Also, \nthe influencing parameters are elaborately discussed based \non mathematical models and machine learning models. \nFinally, potential directions for f uture research are \nprospected to further stimulate case studies, research, and \nindustrial utilization. \n \nAPPENDIX A \nLIST OF ABBREVIATIONS \nAcronyms Meaning Acronyms Meaning \n2FAL 2-Fulfural LR Linear regression \nAE Auto-encoder LSTM Long short-term memory \nAFS Asset fault signature LSSVR Least-square support vector regression \nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.
