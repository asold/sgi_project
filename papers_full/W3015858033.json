INTRODUCTION\nSolid state transformer (SST) is a novel prototype of power\ndistribution transformer based on power electronic converter\ntechnology. It can replace the conventional line frequency\ntransformer, and have ﬂexible controllability and a variety\nof AC and DC ports, which can easily and ﬂexibly access\nvarious distributed power sources, power storage equipment,\nand AC/DC hybrid microgrid [1]. Therefore, SST is taken\nas a fundamental element for the future energy networks,\nincluding energy internet [2]–[5], AC/DC hybrid micro-\ngrid [6]–[7], distributed generation [8], and electric vehicles\n(EVs) [9].\nAt present, the research on SST topology mainly focuses\non three-level [10], four-level [11], and ﬁve-level [12]–[13]\nstructures. Among them, the ﬁve-level SST has gained the\nmost extensive attention and research, with advantages such\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Jahangir Hossain\n.\nas simple ﬁltering circuit, variety of AC and DC ports, easy\nmodularization, etc. [14].\nDue to the limitation of the device voltage rating, it is\nusually necessary to use multiple units for series or paral-\nlel connection in high/low voltage bus and large capacity\napplications [15]. However, the unbalance between voltage\nand power is an inherent problem for the series or parallel\nconnection converter.\nFor the series or parallel connection SST, plenty of\nhigh/low voltage DC (HVDC/LVDC) bus voltage balance and\npower equalization techniques have been explored [16]–[19].\nIn [16], a simple single-phase d-q vector-based common-\nduty-ratio control strategy was proposed for the cascaded\nrectiﬁer stage, achieving excellent performance in the light\nof power factor and grid side current. Based on [16],\na novel voltage balance control strategy was proposed to\nsettle the voltage imbalance that could arise to the dc links\nof different HVDC bus [17]. In [18], a hybrid modulation\nmethod based on both low- and high-frequency modulation\nVOLUME 8, 2020 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Liet al.: Power Control of a Modular Three-Port SST With Three-Phase Unbalance Regulation Capabilities\ntechniques was proposed for Cascaded H-bridge converters\nto achieve DC voltage balance even if in irregular conditions.\nFor the predigesting modulation algorithm, a master-slave\ncontrol (MSC) strategy was scheduled for the cascaded\ndual active bridge (DAB) stage [19]. However, these strate-\ngies cannot effectively reduce the voltage deviation on the\nHVDC/LVDC bus when the load suddenly changes.\nIn order to reduce the voltage deviation on the\nHVDC/LVDC bus, the SST modulation strategy based on\nfeedforward control has been studied [20]. Meanwhile, direct\npower control is one of the most effective methods to improve\nthe dynamic response speed of power electronic converter.\nIn [21], a new simple virtual direct power control (VDPC)\nstrategy, which is ready to be performed as constant fre-\nquency control for the DAB converter to improve the dynamic\nresponse, was proposed. The proposed strategy can reach\nthe target output voltage rapidly and accurately under the\nunconventional environment. These strategies have only been\nveriﬁed in a single-phase SST, and its application in the series\nor parallel connection SST remains to be studied.\nIn brief, the literature mentioned above only consider the\ninternal characteristics of SST. When SST is connected to\nthe DC microgrid, it causes sharp ﬂuctuations in the LVDC\nbus voltage, which directly threatens the safe, and stable\noperation of the DC microgrid. Therefore, the low inertia DC\nmicrogrid will be a very fragile system. If the dc microgrid\nadopts virtual inertia control, the inertia of the dc microgrid\nand the ability to suppress the sudden change of dc bus\nvoltage can be enhanced. In [22], a new bus-signaling strat-\negy was proposed to realize the initiative coordinated prop-\nerty of the system based on different state of charge (SoC)\ncircumstances. Among this, the DC loads perform virtual\ninertia control and demand-side control, respectively. In [23],\nthe virtual synchronous generator (VSG) control strategy was\nproposed to restrain dc-side vibration and raise the inertia of\nthe whole system. In [24], a general virtual inertia control\nstrategy was proposed and implemented in the wind turbines,\nbatteries, and utility grid interfaced converters to avoid the\nbus voltage ﬂuctuations no matter when the DC microgrid\nis operating at the grid-connected mode or at the islanding\nmode. In [25], a dc bus voltage ﬂuctuation elimination strat-\negy was proposed by grid-connected converters equipped,\nwith an analogized virtual synchronous machine (VSM).\nHowever, few papers focus on the virtual inertia control for\nSST connected to the DC microgrid [26], [27]. Reference [26]\nonly discussed the single-phase SST combined with the DC\nmicrogrid. Reference [27] introduced the virtual inertia con-\ntrol for the output stage of the SST, which cannot be directly\napplied to the parallel connection SST. This research devised\nthe DC microgrid as DC link or subgrid of an AC microgrid,\nignoring the dynamic characteristics of the DC microgrid.\nBesides, unbalanced loading is quite common in the SST\nenabled grid with the growth of dynamically varying domes-\ntic loads. Reference [28] proposed a new unbalance compen-\nsation strategy based on reduced order generalized integrator\nto suppress the negative-sequence current. Reference [29]\nproposed a neutral current minimization control for SST\nwhich could save energy in the distribution cables and reduce\npower consumption in the load. However, the existing control\nstrategies are complicated, which affects the performance of\nthe SST.\nIn conclusion, previous control strategies only control the\ninput or output current to mitigate the three-phase unbal-\nance. In the SST-based AC/DC hybrid microgrid, the power\nof the whole system is more concerned than the current\nand is needed to be controlled directly. Moreover, previous\nthree-phase unbalance studies are carried out from the recti-\nﬁer stage or inverter stage. As a multi-stage coupling struc-\nture, the AC/DC hybrid microgrid based on SST should not\nonly mitigate the three-phase unbalance, but also consider the\ndynamic characteristics of other parts to maintain the normal\noperation of the system. Therefore, a three-phase unbalance\nmitigation algorithm based on the overall system should be\nstudied.\nThus, the idea of this paper is to mitigate the three-phase\nunbalance while transmitting the power required by the sys-\ntem from the perspective of power balance. The main contri-\nbutions of this paper are listed as follows:\n• Different from the previous idea that each DAB trans-\nmits the same power, this paper proposed an unbalanced\npower control algorithm for the cascaded DAB. With the\nhelp of the proposed algorithm for the cascaded DAB,\nthe transmission power of each DAB can be allocated\naccording to the three-phase unbalance degree of the\nthree-phase power grid. Thus, the idea of unequal power\nsharing in cascaded DAB can be applied to mitigate the\nthree-phase unbalance from the perspective of power\ncontrol.\n• In order to maintain the normal operation of the whole\nsystem, this paper proposed a three-phase unbalance\npower mitigation algorithm based on the unbalanced\npower control strategy for the cascaded DAB. The pro-\nposed strategy can help the SST realize the function\nof mitigating three-phase unbalance when it transmits\nenergy to the DC microgrid. Thus, the proposed control\nstrategy can mitigate the three-phase unbalance on the\npremise that the power demand of the system is met.\nThis paper is organized as follows: The modeling of the\nbasic topology and operation scheme of SST are discussed\nin Section II. Section III presents how the proposed con-\ntrol method to solve the problems of power and voltage\ndistribution strategy. Section IV demonstrates how the pro-\nposed method to alleviate the grid three-phase imbalance.\nSection V shows the simulation and experimental results\nof modular SST-based DC microgrid established in Mat-\nlab/Simulink instrument and experimental prototype, respec-\ntively. Section VI gives the conclusion.\nII. BASIC TOPOLOGY OF MODULAR SST\nThe demonstrated DC microgrid framework feasibility by\nmodular SST is shown in Fig. 1. This paper concentrates\nupon the power exchange and control issues between the\n72860 VOLUME 8, 2020\nY.

The off-grid type of\nthe system has something in common with the traditional\nDC microgrid, this paper only concentrates upon the modular\nSST-based type to better demonstrate the scheme. When the\nsystem is operational at the off-grid type, the DC microgrid is\ndisconnected from the main grid and SST. Thus, in islanded\nDC microgrid, the power generation and load consumption\nby dispersed units should not be conceived from SST, but\nin a coordinated way to achieve energy management. The\nislanded DC microgrid performs autonomous control accord-\ning to the mode of the DC bus voltage [22].\nFIGURE 2. The Rectifier and DAB module of a modular SST.\nThe parallel rectiﬁer and DAB module of a ﬁve-level SST\nis shown in Fig. 2. Each phase of the grid is connected\nby a rectiﬁer and a DAB converter. All DAB converters\nare connected to a common LVDC bus. The advantage of\nthis conﬁguration is that the power level of each phase is\nreduced, relative to the three-phase connection. Meanwhile,\nthe modular SST can provide AC bus and DC bus, which\nnot only offers an interface for grid-connected photovoltaic,\nwind power or other new energy equipment to generate\nelectricity, but also greatly facilitates bidirectional energy\nexchange between electric vehicles and the grid. Further-\nmore, when one of the three phases fails, the other two phases\ncan continue to work and maintain the normal operation of\nthe system. Besides, the output topology adopts output-\nparallel connection rectiﬁer, then a circulating current is\ngenerated. In the existing literature, there have been many\ndifferent methods developed in order to suppress the circu-\nlating current. For example, the study in [30] proposed a\nzero-sequence circulating-current control strategy by intro-\nducing a variable of the zero-vector duty cycle. The control\nstrategy in [31] was proposed to suppress the zero-sequence\ncirculating current based on common dc-link applications.\nSince the focus of this paper is not how to eliminate the\ncirculating current, this paper adopts the method of series\nresistance in the line to make the voltage consistent, so that\nthe circulation can be eliminated to the greatest extent.\nIn Fig. 2, Uini represents the ith output voltage of the paral-\nlel converter, Uo represents the output voltage of the DAB\nconverters. The DC-links provided in output by the DAB\nconverters can be connected to loads, storage, and DC sources\nseparately or can be connected in parallel based on the DC\nSmart Grid conﬁguration.\nIII. OVERALL CONTROL STRATEGY OF MODULAR\nSST-BASED DC MICROGRID\nThe proposed control strategy combines rectiﬁer level con-\ntrol, DAB level control, and DC microgrid control. The main\nobjective of rectiﬁer stage control is to maintain HVDC bus\nvoltage stability and unity power factor. The proposed DAB\nlevel control strategy can realize the transmission of different\npower of different DAB modules and simplify the modulation\nstrategy. Virtual inertial control is adopted for DC microgrid\ncontrol, which can not only maintain the stability of the\nLVDC bus but also reduce the ﬂuctuation range of LVDC bus\nvoltage.\nA. ANALYSIS OF THE PARALLEL RECTIFIER STAGE\nThrough application of the three-dimensional space vector\nmodulation (3-D SVPWM), each phase can be indepen-\ndently regulated through the fourth leg, thus control of the\nthree phase voltages are decoupled. AC/DC conversion stage\ncontrol adopts the double-closed control strategy which can\nensure that the grid voltage is in phase with the network side\ncurrent and the network side current is a sinusoidal wave. The\nrapid and stable adjustment of DC bus voltage ensures the\nstability of the power exchange between the AC/DC stage and\nthe DAB stage. However, due to the coupling in the rotating\ncoordinate system, decoupling control is required, so the\nblock diagram of AC/DC transformational control strategy\nadopted in this paper is shown in Figure. 3. Where Ri, Li,\nigi (i = a,b,c) are the grid side resistor, ﬁlter inductor,\ninductor current of each phase, respectively. Uiniref is the ith\nunit HVDC bus voltage command value. Ugid and Ugiq are\nthe DC components of grid voltage converted by dq transfor-\nmation in each phase. igid and igiq are the DC components\nof grid current converted by dq transformation in each phase.\ni∗\ngid and i∗\ngiq are the command current value converted by dq\ntransformation in each phase. ωis the synchronous rotation\nangular frequency.\nVOLUME 8, 2020 72861\nY. Liet al.: Power Control of a Modular Three-Port SST With Three-Phase Unbalance Regulation Capabilities\nFIGURE 3. The overall control block diagram of modular SST-based DC microgrid.\nThe parallel rectiﬁers control strategy uses double\nclosed-loop vector control: (1) The outer loop is a voltage\nloop and the PI regulator is used to control the HVDC bus\nvoltage of each phase, keeping it consistent with the voltage\ncommand value Uiniref . (2) The inner loop is a current loop,\nand the PI regulator is used to control the alternating current\nso that it can track the command current i∗\ngid without static\nerror. Finally, the parallel rectiﬁers unit drive pulse can be\nobtained through a certain modulation strategy.\nB. POWER CONTROL FOR MODULAR SST IN DAB STAGE\nThe premise application of the power control method is to\nobtain the instantaneous power value of one switching cycle\nof the converter. This section ﬁrst analyzes the power value\nof the DAB converter in one control cycle under any inductor\ncurrent.\nThe main circuit topology of the DAB converter is shown\nin Figure. 4. In Figure. 4, n is the ratio of the isolation\ntransformer; Uin is the voltage on the power supply side; Lk\nand il are the auxiliary inductor and the primary current of\nthe transformer; Uab and Ucd are the output voltages of the\nH-bridge at both ends of the converter; Ch and Cl are the\nsupport capacitors of power supply side and load side; Uo and\nio are the output voltage and load current respectively; R is the\nconverter equivalent load.\nFigure. 5 shows the steady-state waveform diagram of the\nsingle phase shift (SPS) control method of the DAB con-\nverter [32]. In the ﬁgure, S1 to S8 are the control signals of\ncorresponding switches, with the same frequency and duty\ncycle of 0.5. The upper and lower control signals of the\nFIGURE 4. Dual active bridge converter.\nsame bridge arm are complementary. D represents the phase\ndifference between the control signals of switch tube S1, S3,\nS5 and S7. Ts is the switching period.\nConsidering the symmetry of the converter waveform in\nsteady state, the SPS control waveform from t0 to t2 in\nFigure. 2 is taken as the research object. From Figure. 5,\nthe corresponding current at each point from t0 to t2 can be\nobtained as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ni0 =(1 −2D)TsUo −nTsUin\n4nLk\ni1 =TsUo +n(2D −1)TsUin\n4nLk\ni2 =nTsUin −(1 −2D)TsUo\n4nLk\n(1)\nIgnoring the system loss, from equation (1), it can be\nconcluded that the transient output power PDAB is:\nPDAB = 2\nTs\n∫ t2\nt0\nUab(t)iLk (t)dt =UinUoD(1 −D)Ts\n2nLk\n(2)\n72862 VOLUME 8, 2020\nY. Liet al.: Power Control of a Modular Three-Port SST With Three-Phase Unbalance Regulation Capabilities\nFIGURE 5. Schematic diagram of single-phase-shift control.\nIn the case where the input and output voltages remain\nconstant for one control period, the transmitted power PDAB\nis related to the phase shift control amount Di regardless of\nthe initial value io of the inductor current. In fact, when the\ninductor current is biased, (2) becomes\nPDAB = 1\nTs\n∫ t4\nt0\nUab(t)(iL (t) −I)dt\n= 1\nTs\nUab(t) · iL (t) −Uab(t)Idt (3)\nwhere, I is the bias of the inductor current relative to the\nsteady-state inductor current when it changes dynamically.\nBecause the value of Uabi in a control period is exactly half\nof the positive and negative Uini, the integral of Uabi and the\nbias current portion is zero, the power value is also zero.\nConsidering that during all module switching periods Ts,\ntransformer ratio n, equivalent inductance L are equal and\nremain the same. Besides, the HVDC bus is connected to the\ngrid through the parallel rectiﬁer, and the parallel rectiﬁer\noutput voltage is controlled by their voltage control. This\npaper considers that the output voltage of each phase rectiﬁer\nis the same. thus:\nUina =Uinb =Uinc (4)\nCombining (2) and (4), the simpliﬁcation amount transmis-\nsion power of DAB is given by (5).\nP∗\nDAB =2nLPi\nTsUini\n=UoDi(1 −Di) (5)\nThus, the transmitted power of each DAB module is only\nrelated to Uoi and Di.\nFrom (2) and (5), the transmission power range of each\nDAB module can be obtained by (6).\n0 ⩽ PDAB ⩽ PDAB,max =UiniUo\n4nL (6)\nwhere PDAB,max is the maximum transmission power of each\nDAB modular, when Di =0.5.\nAccording to Fig. 2, the power transmitted by all DAB\nmodules is equal to the sum of the required power of the\nDC microgrid and the power ﬂows through the capacitor Co,\nwhich can be expressed as (7).\nPDCM =PDAB −PCo\n=PDABa +PDABb +PDABc −PCo (7)\nwhere PDCM is the required power of the DC microgrid,\nPDABa, PDABb, PDABc are the power to be transmitted of each\nDAB module, PCo is the power through Co.\nIt is worth mentioning that if the total transmission\npower is greater than the sum of the maximum transmis-\nsion power of all modules, any control strategy cannot\nachieve the lossless transmission of power, which can be\nexpressed as (8).\nP∗\nDCM <PDABa,max +PDABb,max +PDABc,max (8)\nFrom (5) and (7), PDAB is only related to Uoi and Di. Since\nthe power of the DC microgrid is determined [22], the power\nrequired by the DC microgrid can be used to control Uoi.\nThus, the DC microgrid provides power refers for the DAB\nstage to directly control the phase shift angle.\nC. POWER VIRTUAL INERTIA CONTROL STRATEGY\nOF DC MICROGRID\nIn order to obtain and improve the dynamic performance of\nthe LVDC bus voltage, this paper introduces a power-based\nvirtual inertial control strategy for DC microgrid. Similar\nto the virtual inertial control strategy of the AC microgrid,\nthe inertia of the DC microgrid manifests the ability to prevent\nsudden changes of the LVDC bus voltage Uoi.\nAccording to [25], the mechanical equation of Vir-\ntual Synchronous Generator (VSG) in AC microgrid is\ngiven by (9).\nPset −Pe −DP(ω−ωn) =Jωdω\ndt ≈Jωn\ndω\ndt (9)\nwhere Pset , Pe, DP, ωand ωn are the active power reference,\nthe electromagnetic power, the damping coefﬁcient, the angu-\nlar frequency of the VSM, and the rated angular frequency of\nthe utility grid, respectively.\nOn the low voltage DC side, the Power-V oltage droop\ncontrol can be expressed as\nPDAB −PDCM =DDCM (Uo −Uon) (10)\nwhere Uoin is the rated voltage of the LVDC bus. Similar\nto the droop control of the AC microgrid, by combining (9)\nVOLUME 8, 2020 72863\nY. Liet al.: Power Control of a Modular Three-Port SST With Three-Phase Unbalance Regulation Capabilities\nand (10), the DC microgrid virtual inertia control strategy\nbased on P/V droop control can be obtained.\nPDAB −PDCM −DDCM (Uo −Uon) =CoUo\ndUo\ndt\n≈CoUon\ndUo\ndt (11)\nAccording to (2), (4), (10) and (11), Fig. 3 shows the block\ndiagram of the overall power-sharing virtual inertia control\nstrategy for DC microgrid analogized with modular SST. The\noverall control method mainly includes the virtual inertia\ncontrol of the DC microgrid, direct power ﬂow control of the\nDAB module and voltage control of the parallel rectiﬁer.\nCombined with the above analysis, the proposed power\ncontrol strategy can be performed through the following\nsteps:\nStep 1:According to the variation power of the DC micro-\ngrid, Uo can be obtained by using the virtual inertia and\nP/V droop control method in the DC Microgrid. Meanwhile,\nUini can be obtained through the double closed-loop control.\nStep 2:Since both Uini and Uo have been obtained, accord-\ning to the proposed power control strategy, each DAB module\ncan transmit power on the basis of the power required by the\nDC microgrid.\nStep 3: Through step 2, the duty ratios Da, Db, Dc are\ntransformed into the drive pulse acting on the DAB converter\nby the SPS control.\nD. THREE-PHASE UNBALANCE REGULATION\nAs is shown in Figure. 1, when the grid power ﬂows through\nthe modular SST, the proposed control strategy can control\nthe transmission power of each DAB converter in each phase\nseparately. Thus, each DAB converter in each phase con-\nsumes different power to improve the three-phase unbalance\nof the AC grid.\nUnbalanced grid voltage can be divided into positive\nsequence component, negative sequence component and zero\nsequence component [33].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nua(t)=U+sin(ωt) +U−sin (ωt +ϕ1)\n+U0 sin (ωt +ϕ2)\nub(t) =U+sin(ωt −2π/3) +U−sin (ωt +2π/3 +ϕ1)\n+U0 sin (ωt +ϕ2)\nuc(t) =U+sin(ωt −2π/3) +U−sin (ωt −2π/3 +ϕ1)\n+U0 sin (ωt +ϕ2)\n(12)\nwhere U+, U−and U0 are the amplitudes of positive, neg-\native and zero sequence components of the voltage respec-\ntively, ϕ1 and ϕ2 are the phase of negative sequence and zero\nsequence components of voltage.\nSince the input stage of the modular SST connects with\nthe power grid with a star conﬁguration, there is no active\npower ﬂows between positive sequence reactive current and\npositive sequence component of grid voltage.

However, some DAB converters may transmit more\npower than Pr due to the three-phase unbalance mitigation\nin this paper. According to the three-phase unbalance degree\nmentioned in [29], the maximum unbalance degree consid-\nered in this paper is 20%. Therefore, the rated power of each\nDAB converter in this paper is 1.2P r .\nSuppose a ≥ b ≥ c, that is, the a-phase unbalanced\npower is greater than or equal to the b-phase, and the b-phase\nunbalanced power is greater than or equal to the c-phase.\nAt this point, DABa needs to transmit the most power.\nWhen PDABa ≤1.2Pr , PDABb and PDABc will not exceed\nthe rated power, then the power required to be transmitted by\neach DAB is allocated according to (19). Thus, Da, Db, Dc\ncan be obtained by combining (5), (7) and (20).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDa =1\n2(1 ±\n√\n1 − 4abUo\nac +bc +ab\n(\nPDCM +PCo\n)\n)\nDb =1\n2(1 ±\n√\n1 − 4acUo\nac +bc +ab\n(\nPDCM +PCo\n)\n)\nDc =1\n2(1 ±\n√\n1 − 4bcUo\nac +bc +ab\n(\nPDCM +PCo\n)\n)\n(21)\nWhen PDABa > 1.2Pr , DABa transmits the rated\npower 1.2Pr .

If PDABb < 1.2Pr ,\nthe power transmission is performed according to (22).\nIf PDABb > 1.2Pr , the power is redistributed according to\nthe method of PDABa >1.2Pr . If the required power of the\nDC microgrid exceeds the sum of the rated transmission\npower (3.6P r ) of the three DAB converters, then the power\ndemand of the DC microgrid should be satisﬁed ﬁrst without\nconsidering mitigating the three-phase unbalance.\nIt is worth mentioning that the three-phase unbalance\ncontrol strategy proposed in this paper can only mitigate\nthe three-phase unbalance but can not completely eliminate\nthe three-phase unbalance. This is because the power con-\ntrol strategy proposed in this paper not only mitigates the\nthree-phase unbalance but also supplies power to the DC\nmicrogrid.\nFrom the above analysis, when three-phase unbalance\noccurs in the power grid, according to the current power\nrequired by the DC microgrid, the phase with higher voltage\nconsumes more power from the grid. Meanwhile, the phase\nwith lower voltage consumes less power from the grid. Thus,\nthe three-phase unbalanced power can be adjusted.\nIV. SIMULATION AND EXPERIMENT RESULTS\nIn order to verify the performance of the proposed method,\na three-phase 380-V/ 50-V modular SST simulation model\nis built in Matlab/Simulink platform. At the same time,\nthe experimental prototype is established. The main power\nstage parameters are shown in Table 1.\nTABLE 1. Power stage parameters.\nA. SIMULATION\nFig. 6 shows the simulation results of the SST-based\nDC microgrid under the traditional power balance control\nmethod. Fig. 6(a) shows the initial input source which has\na slight unbalance. At 0.3s, the power required by the\nDC microgrid has changed from 360w to 600w. At the\ntime, the traditional power equlization control is established.\nFig. 6(b) shows the output three-phase waves with traditional\npower balance control method. Fig. 6(c) shows the transmit\npower of each DAB module. As is shown by Fig. 6(c), each\nDAB module transmits the same power. From Fig. 6(a),\nFig. 6(b) and Fig. 6(c), When the power required by the\nDC microgrid has changed at 0.3s, the three-phase unbalance\nis not improved as each DAB module consumes the same\npower. Fig. 6(d) shows the output voltage of DAB module.\nSince the traditional method uses a DAB module to control\nthe low-voltage DC bus voltage, so when the DC microgrid\npower changes, its response speed is slow.\nVOLUME 8, 2020 72865\nY.

(d) DAB\noutput voltage.\nFig. 7 shows the simulation results of the SST-based DC\nmicrogrid under the proposed power control method. Fig. 7(a)\nshows the initial input source which has a slight unbalance.\nAt 0.3s, the power required by the DC microgrid has changed\nfrom 360w to 600w. Meanwhile, the proposed power control\nis established. Fig.7 (b) shows the output three-phase waves\nwith the proposed power control method. Fig.7 (c) shows the\ntransmit power of each DAB module. As can be seen from\nFig. 7(c), each DAB module transmit different power accord-\ning to the required power of the DC microgrid. From Fig. 7(a),\nFig. 7(b) and Fig. 7(c), When the power required by the DC\nmicrogrid has changed at 0.3s, the three-phase unbalance\nis well improved as each DAB module consumes different\npower. Besides, the phase with higher unbalance consumes\nmore power from the grid. Meanwhile, the phase with lower\nunbalance consumes less power from the grid. Fig. 7(d)\nshows the output voltage of DAB module. Since the proposed\nmethod uses DC microgrid to control the low-voltage DC\nbus voltage, so when the DC microgrid power changes, its\nresponse speed is fast.\nTo test the system under different unbalance conditions,\nthe input source is set in a large unbalance environment.\nFIGURE 7.

(d) DAB\noutput voltage.\nFig. 8(a) and Fig. 8(b) shows the voltage waveforms before\nand after 0.3s, respectively. As can be seen from the\nwaveforms, through the modular SST-based DC microgrid,\nthe imbalance degree of the output voltage can be restored to a\nrelatively balanced degree. Fig. 8(c) shows the transmit power\nof each DAB module. Fig. 8(d) shows the output voltage of\nthe DAB module. Through the operating waveforms it could\nbe seen that the cascaded DAB module can transmit different\npower according to the power transmission coefﬁcient while\nthe LVDC bus voltage is still maintained at the set value.\nB. EXPERIMENT RESULTS\nA small power experimental test prototype with DSP-\nTMS320F28335+FPGA-XC6SLX9 as the main controller\nwas designed and constructed, as is shown in Fig. 9. The\nmain circuit of the prototype is shown in Fig. 2. Further-\nmore, the communication circuit is RS232+RS485, and the\nmodel of the IGBTs in the AC-DC stage is 2MBI 75U4A −\n120, and the model of the IGBTs in the DAB stage is\nCM400DU −24NFH.\nAs is shown in Fig. 2, the modular SST consists of three\nH-bridge rectiﬁers with their inputs connected in parallel.\n72866 VOLUME 8, 2020\nY.

Fig. 12(c) illustrates the\ntransmit power of each DAB module. Fig. 12(d) illustrates\nthe LVDC bus voltage. The experimental results demonstrate\nthe performance of the proposed control method for the DAB\nstage of modular SST. It can be seen from Fig. 11 and\nFig. 12 that the three-phase unbalance of the grid is well\nimproved when the proposed strategy of absorbing unbal-\nanced power is adopted.\nV. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, a novel unbalance power control strategy for\ncascaded DAB in a modular SST is proposed. The proposed\npower control method allows different DAB modules to\ntransmit different power through the module DAB structure.\nThus, the idea of unequal power sharing in cascaded DAB\ncan be applied to mitigate the three-phase unbalance from\nthe perspective of power control. Furthermore, a three-phase\nunbalance mitigation method based on the DC microgrid\npower consumption and the three-phase unbalance degree\nis proposed. The proposed control strategy can mitigate the\nthree-phase unbalance and meet the power demand of the\nDC microgrid. The simulation and experiment results have\ndemonstrated that the proposed strategy can effectively deal\nwith the unbalance of modular SST-based AC/DC hybrid\nmicrogrid.\nREFERENCES\n[1] J. E.
