However, these methods cannot al-\nways include the phrase in the generated\nheadline. Inspired by previous RNN-based\nmethods generating token sequences in back-\nward and forward directions from the given\nphrase, we propose a simple Transformer-\nbased method that guarantees to include the\ngiven phrase in the high-quality generated\nheadline. We also consider a new headline\ngeneration strategy that takes advantage of the\ncontrollable generation order of Transformer.\nOur experiments with the Japanese News Cor-\npus demonstrate that our methods, which are\nguaranteed to include the phrase in the gener-\nated headline, achieve ROUGE scores compa-\nrable to previous Transformer-based methods.\nWe also show that our generation strategy per-\nforms better than previous strategies.\n1 Introduction\nFollowing the initial work of Rush et al. (2015),\nabstractive headline generation using the encoder-\ndecoder model has been studied extensively\n(Chopra et al., 2016; Nallapati et al., 2016; Paulus\net al., 2018). In the automatic headline generation\nfor advertising articles, there are requests to include\na given phrase such as a company or product name\nin the headline.\nGenerating a headline that includes a given\nphrase has been considered one of the lexically con-\nstrained sentence generation tasks. For these tasks,\n∗Work done during an internship at The Asahi Shimbun\nCompany\n†Work done at The Asahi Shimbun Company\nthere are two major approaches. One approach is\nto select a plausible sentence including the given\nphrase from several candidate sentences generated\nfrom left to right (Hokamp and Liu, 2017; Ander-\nson et al., 2017; Post and Vilar, 2018). Although\nthese methods can include multiple phrases in a\ngenerated sentence, they are computationally ex-\npensive due to the large search space of the decod-\ning process. In addition, since they try to force\ngiven phrases into sentences at every step of the\ngeneration process, these methods may harm the\nquality of the generated sentence (Liu et al., 2019).\nAnother approach proposed by Mou et al. (2015)\nis to generate token sequences in backward and\nforward directions from the given phrase. Mou\net al. (2016) proposed Sequence to Backward and\nForward Sequences (Seq2BF), which applies the\nmethod of Mou et al. (2015) to the sequence-to-\nsequence (seq2seq) framework. They use an RNN-\nbased model and adopt the best strategies proposed\nby Mou et al. (2015), generating the backward se-\nquence from the phrase and then generating the\nremaining forward sequence. Liu et al. (2019) intro-\nduced the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)\nto the model of Mou et al. (2015) to resolve the\nexposure bias problem (Bengio et al., 2015) caused\nby generating sequences individually, and used the\nattention mechanism (Bahdanau et al., 2015) to\nimprove the consistency between both sequences.\nHowever, their model does not support the seq2seq\nframework.\nRecently, He et al. (2020) used a Transformer-\nbased model (Vaswani et al., 2017), which is re-\nported to achieve high performance, to generate a\nheadline containing a given phrase. They proposed\nproviding an encoder with additional information\nrelated to the given phrase. However, their method\nmay not always include the given phrases in the\ngenerated headline.\nIn this study, we work on generating lexically\nconstrained headlines using Transformer-based\n4086\nSeq2BF. The RNN-based model used by Mou et al.\n(2016) executes a strategy of continuous generation\nin one direction, and thus cannot utilize the infor-\nmation of the forward sequence when generating\nthe backward sequence. However, Transformer can\nexecute a variety of generative strategies by devis-\ning attention masks, so it can solve the problem of\nthe RNN-based model. We propose a new strategy\nthat generates each token from a given phrase alter-\nnately in the backward and forward directions, in\naddition to adapting and extending the strategies of\nMou et al. (2016) to the Transformer architecture.\nOur experiments with a Japanese summarization\ncorpus show that our proposed method always in-\ncludes the given phrase in the generated headline\nand achieves performance comparable to previous\nTransformer-based methods. We also show that our\nproposed generating strategy performs better than\nthe extended strategy of the previous methods.\n2 Proposed Method\nWe propose a Transformer-based Seq2BF model\nthat applies Seq2BF proposed by Mou et al. (2016)\nto the Transformer model to generate headlines\nincluding a given phrase. The Seq2BF takes W(=\nw1, ..., wL; w1:L) as the given phrase consisting of\nL tokens and generates the headline y−M:−1 of M\ntokens backward from W, and the headline y1:N\nof N tokens forward from W. The Transformer-\nbased Seq2BF is the Transformer model with two\ngeneration components, consisting of a linear and\na softmax layer (see Figure 1).\nIn Transformer-based Seq2BF unlike Trans-\nformer generating tokens from left to right, the\ntoken position changes relatively depending on al-\nready generated tokens. We determine the token\nposition, inputting to the positional encoding layer\nof the decoder, ⌊L+1\n2 ⌋in W to be 0, and the posi-\ntion in the backward direction to be negative, and\nthe position in the forward direction to be positive.\nWe consider the following four generation strate-\ngies. In addition to two strategies (a) and (b), which\nextend those proposed by Mou et al. (2016), we\nproposfe new strategies (c) and (d) as step-wise al-\nternating generation to keep better contextual con-\nsistency in both backward and forward directions.\n(a) Generating a sequence backwardand then a\nsequence forward. (Seq-B)\n(b) Generating a sequence forwardand then a se-\nquence backward.

(Tok-B)\n(d) Generating each token forwardand then back-\nward alternately. (Tok-F)\nTransformer-based Seq2BF is formulated as\nP(Y |X, W) =\n∏\nj∈POS j\nP(yj|Yobs, X), (1)\nwhere X denotes tokens of the article, W\ndenotes tokens of the given phrase, Y (=\ny−M:−1, w1:L, y1:N ) denotes tokens of the ﬁnal\ngenerated headline, and Yobs denotes the already-\ngenerated partial headline including W. Also,\nPOS j denotes a list of token positions representing\nthe order of tokens to be generated corresponding\nto each generation strategy (see Figure 1), for ex-\nample [−1, −2, ...,−M, 1, 2, ..., N] in Seq-B. In\nTok-B/F which M and N are different, once the\ngeneration in one direction is completed, the gen-\neration will be continued only in the remaining\ndirections until M + N steps. For example in the\ncase of M > Nin Tok-B, our method completes\ngenerating tokens in the forward direction ﬁrst, so\nit generates them in both directions until the 2N\nstep, and then generates them only in the backward\ndirection from the 2N + 1step to the M + N step.\nTo train the model on these generative strate-\ngies, we have prepared an attention mask for the\n4087\n(b) Seq-F\n𝑦!\"𝑦!#𝑤#𝑦#𝑦\"\n(a) Seq-B (d) Tok-F(c) Tok-B\n𝑦!\"𝑦!#𝑤#𝑦#𝑦\"\nInput\nOutput\n𝑦!\"𝑦!#𝑤#𝑦#𝑦\" 𝑦!\"𝑦!#𝑤#𝑦#𝑦\" 𝑦!\"𝑦!#𝑤#𝑦#𝑦\"𝑦!\"𝑦!#𝑤#𝑦#𝑦\"\n𝑦!\"𝑦!#𝑤#𝑦#𝑦\"\n𝑦!\"𝑦!#𝑤#𝑦#𝑦\"\nFigure 2: Attention mask patterns on the decoder side during training, used for each generation strategy in\nTransformer-based Seq2BF.

Transformer can control the generation\norder of tokens by devising the attention mask used\nin the decoder’s self-attention mechanism. Trans-\nformer generates tokens from left to right, so it is\nsufﬁcient to disable the attention to tokens forward\nfrom the input tokens. However, the Transformer-\nbased Seq2BF needs to specify the areas where\ninput tokens disallow the attention in the backward\nand forward directions, depending on each genera-\ntion strategy (see Figure 2).\n3 Experiment\nWe conducted the experiment to verify the perfor-\nmance of our methods in the headline generation\ntask. The objective of our experiment is to com-\npare our method with previous Transformer-based\nmethods that generate tokens from left to right. We\nalso compare Seq-B/F, the generation orders pro-\nposed by Mou et al. (2016), with Tok-B/F, our new\ngeneration orders.\n3.1 Setting\nWe used the 2019 version of the Japanese News\nCorpus (JNC)1 (Hitomi et al., 2019) as the dataset.\nThe JNC contains 1,932,399 article-headline pairs,\nand we split them randomly at a ratio of 98:1:1\nfor use as training, validation, and test sets, respec-\ntively.2 We utilized MeCab (Kudo et al., 2004)\nwith the IPAdic3 and then applied the Byte Pair\nEncoding (BPE) algorithm4 (Gage, 1994) for to-\nkenization. We trained BPE with 10,000 merge\noperations and obtained the most frequent 32,000\n1https://cl.asahi.com/api_data/\njnc-jamul-en.html\n2We applied the preprocessing script at\nhttps://github.com/asahi-research/\nscript-for-transformer-based-seq2bf to\nthe original JNC to obtain the split dataset.\n3https://taku910.github.io/mecab/\n4https://github.com/rsennrich/\nsubword-nmt\ntokens from the articles and the headlines, respec-\ntively.\nWe used context word sequences extracted from\nthe reference headlines by GiNZA5 as the ‘given’\nphrase.6 An average of 4.99 phrases was ex-\ntracted from the reference headlines, and the ‘given’\nphrases consisted of an average of 2.32 tokens. We\nevaluated our methods using precision, recall, and\nF-score of ROUGE-1/2/L (Lin, 2004) and success\nrate (SR), which is the percentage of the headline\nthat includes the given phrase. We also calculated\nthe Average Length Difference (ALD) to analyze\nthe length of the generated headlines, as\nALD = 1\nn\nn∑\ni=1\nli −leni, (2)\nwhere n, li, and leni are the number of samples,\nthe length of the generated headline, and the length\nof the reference headline, respectively.\nAs a comparison method, we adopted the method\nproposed by He et al. (2020) with vanilla Trans-\nformer instead of BART (Lewis et al., 2020). This\nmethod controls the output by inserting the given\nphrase and the special token ‘|’ in front of the in-\nput articles and randomly drops the given phrase\nfrom the input articles during training to improve\nthe performance. The hyperparameters of both the\ncomparison and our models are determined as de-\nscribed in Vaswani et al. (2017). The training was\nterminated when the perplexity computed on the\nvalidation set did not update three times in a row,\nand we used the model with the minimum perplex-\nity on the validation set. The beam size during the\ninference was set to three.\n5https://github.com/megagonlabs/ginza\n6We used “ginza.bunsetu_phrase_spans”API.\n4088\nSR ROUGE-1 ROUGE-2 ROUGE-L ALD params\nP/R/F P/R/F P/R/F ×106\nTransformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) 36.3 57.1/48.9/51.4 29.8/25.2/26.5 47.1/40.9/42.8 –3.62 72\nTransformer version of He et al.

Blue and orange bars indicate the generated and reference headlines, respectively.\n3.2 Results\nTable 1 shows the experimental results. Note\nthat the proposed and compared methods achieved\nhigher ROUGE scores than Transformer because\nwe computed ROUGE scores between the reference\nand the system-generated headlines, including the\nphrase extracted from the reference headlines.\nOur methods always include the given phrase\nin the generated headlines, whereas the compar-\nison method had a success rate of around 90%.\nAlthough the recall of ROUGE scores tended\nto be higher in the comparison method than in\nthe proposed method, the precision and F-scores\nof ROUGE scores in the proposed method were\ncomparable or higher than in the comparison\nmethod. As we notice from ALD, we found that\nTransformer-based Seq2BF generated shorter head-\nlines than the Transformer models. It has been con-\nﬁrmed that the Transformer models with a single\noutput direction tend to generate shorter headlines\nthan the reference. Because Transformer-based\nSeq2BF has two output directions, the generated\nheadlines were considered to be even shorter. This\nis the reason why our methods had lower recall\nscores than the comparison methods. Compar-\ning the generation strategies of Transformer-based\nSeq2BF, we can see that Tok-B/F had a higher score\nthan Seq-B/F.\nTo analyze how the four generation strategies\nof Transformer-based Seq2BF affected the system-\ngenerated headlines, we showed the character-level\nposition of the given phrase in the headline us-\ning histograms in Figure 3. As we can see, all\ngeneration strategies had similar distributions in\nthe reference and system-generated headlines, and\nhence Transformer-based Seq2BF has also been\npresumed to learn the position of a given phrase\nin the headline. Focusing on the headlines that in-\nclude the given phrase in the head, the difference\nbetween the reference and the headline generated\nby Tok-B/F is smaller than that of the headline\ngenerated by Seq-B/F. Also, the headlines gener-\nated by Seq-B tend to place the given phrase in the\nbeginning, while this tendency is opposite for the\nheadlines generated by Seq-F.\nTable 2 shows examples of the headlines gen-\nerated by the Transformer-based Seq2BF (Tok-B).\nWhen a product name such as “桜とイワシのパ\nフェ” (“Cherry Blossom and Sardine Parfait”) was\ngiven, our methods could generate a natural head-\nline that includes the given phrase. Also, given the\nphrase “6月末” (“the End of June”), our methods\ngenerated a headline with the addition of “ 販売”\n(“on Sale”) that matched the given phrase. On the\nother hand, we found the problem of generating the\nsame words related to the given phrase in the back-\nward and forward directions, such as the headline\ngenerated given “群れ” (“Schools”). In addition,\ngiven the phrase “約1万匹” (“About 10,000”), our\nmethods generated the headline meaning that spe-\ncial sweets contain about 10,000 sardines. In this\nway, examples that were not faithful to the article\nwere conﬁrmed.\n4089\nArticle: 約1万匹のイワシが群れで泳ぐ様子を見られる京都水族館。この展示に合わせ、ちょっぴり変わった特\n別スイーツが6月末まで販売される。名前は「桜といわしのパフェ」で、...\nAt the Kyoto Aquarium, you can see about 10,000 sardines swimming in schools.

In gen-\neral, it is difﬁcult to control the diversity in headline\ngeneration, but our methods can generate diverse\nheadlines by giving a variety of phrases. However,\nit may be necessary to discuss whether our methods\ncould generate diverse headlines. The reason is that\nall examples are only partially diverse. Speciﬁcally,\nthey always include “ 特別スイーツ” (“Special\nSweets”) and “京都水族館” (“Kyoto Aquarium”)\nas important contents in the headline.\n4 Conclusion\nWe proposed Transformer-based Seq2BF that gen-\nerates the lexically constrained headline by devis-\ning the attention mask for the decoder and gener-\nating backward and forward sentences from the\nphrase. Our experiments using the JNC demon-\nstrated that Transformer-based Seq2BF always in-\ncludes the given phrase in the generated headline\nand obtains comparable performance compared\nto previous Transformer-based methods. We also\nshowed that strategies of generating each token\nalternately between backward and forward direc-\ntions are more effective than that of generating a\nsequence in one direction and then a sequence in\nanother direction.\nIn future work, we will investigate whether\nTransformer-based Seq2BF can generate natural\nheadlines even when given a variety of phrases,\nsuch as phrases not in the reference or the article,\nand examine if our methods can creatively generate\ndiverse headlines by giving a variety of phrases\nquantitatively. Also, we will explore methods for\ngenerating headlines that include multiple phrases.\nReferences\nPeter Anderson, Basura Fernando, Mark Johnson, and\nStephen Gould. 2017.
