This study involved the \nsynthesis of 33 published articles and a total of 3421 social media documents, including tweets, \nposts, expert opinions, and industry reports on utilizing LLMs in supply chain management. By \nemploying BERT models, four core themes were derived: Supply chain optimization, supply chain \nrisk and security management, supply chain knowledge management, and automated contract \nintelligence, which provides the present status of LLM in the supply chain. The results of this study \nwill empower managers to identify prospective applications and areas for improvement, affording \nthem a comprehensive understanding of the antecedents, decisions, and outcomes detailed in the \nframework. The insights garnered from this study are highly valuable to both researchers and managers, \nequipping them to harness the latest advancements in LLM technology and its role within supply \nchain management.\nKEywoRDS\nBERT, Large language model, Social Media, Supply chain management\nINTR oDUCTI oN\nA supply chain, integral to modern businesses, facilitates the exchange of materials, information, \nand resources among interconnected organizations, ensuring the delivery of valuable products and \nservices to consumers (Stadler, 2008). It operates within a complex web of suppliers, customers, and \nservice providers, which demands intricate decision-making (Bag et al., 2023). While technological \nJournal of Global Information Management\nVolume 32 • Issue 1\n2\nadvancements have automated and optimized supply chain operations, the challenge of conveying \noptimization outcomes to stakeholders persists.1\nFurthermore, the exponential growth of Internet data presents both opportunities and challenges \nfor organizations. Modern supply chain professionals must leverage big data analytics, including data \nscience and big data, to enhance the supply chain’s processes and performance (Chatterjee et al., 2023; \nWaller & Fawcett, 2013). However, data quality remains paramount for effective decision-making \nin supply chain management (SCM), which emphasizes the significance of functional capabilities, \ninformation sharing, and data proficiency (Hazen et al., 2014). The successful management of \noperations and the supply chain hinges on a data-centric approach, which has evolved from traditional \nreporting to advanced analytics that encompasses statistical analysis, forecasting, and real-time \noptimization (Jacobs et al., 2014). Nonetheless, integrating big data analytics into supply chains \nremains a huge scope for research (Kache and Seuring, 2017).\nSupply chain operations entail complex decision-making despite the automation and optimization \nachieved through advancements in computing (Oliveira & Pereira, 2023). Although optimization \ntools have enhanced the efficiency of supply chain decision-making, they frequently necessitate input \nfrom individuals lacking expertise, resulting in prolonged interactions with program managers and \ndata experts (Lambert & Cooper, 2000). The emergence of large language models (LLMs) such as \nChatGPT has spurred interest in the application of artificial intelligence (AI) within supply chains. \nThese LLMs, including various deep generative models (DGM), play a pivotal role in deciphering \nintricate probability distributions (Li et al., 2023a). Within the retail sector, ChatGPT is used to \nenhance inventory management and detect trends in customer inquiries, seamlessly integrating with \nsupply chain software and warehouse management systems (Kumar et al., 2023). Meanwhile, in the \nmilitary domain, AI is revolutionizing equipment acquisition and sustainment, predicting demand, \noptimizing transport routes, and automating inventory management to trim expenses and enhance \nsupply chain efficiency (Mikhailov, 2023).\nAnother critical aspect of the supply chain involves security breaches. Relying on software systems \nleads to increased vulnerability to supply chain breaches, resulting in significant financial and data \nlosses. Prioritizing cybersecurity is crucial, yet traditional methods for analyzing past failures involve \nmanual report reading and summarization. Automated support through natural language processing \n(NLP), including LLMs, can reduce costs and enhance the analysis of such incidents (Trappey et al., \n2022; Singla et al., 2023).\nThere are numerous examples of industries that have started to use NLP and AI to enhance \nsupply chain efficiency. For example, IBM Watson offers SCM solutions that incorporate NLP and \nAI capabilities. It can analyze unstructured data, such as news articles and social media, to provide \ninsights into supply chain risks and opportunities (Ganesh & Kalpana, 2022). Another firm named \nSAP Ariba leverages AI and NLP to improve procurement and supplier management. It can assist in \nsupplier discovery, risk assessment, and contract analysis, thereby enhancing supply chain efficiency.\n2 \nFurthermore, Llamasoft’s supply chain design software uses AI and machine learning, including NLP, \nto assist companies in optimizing their supply chain networks. It can process textual data to improve \ndecision-making in its supply chain design.\n3 Moreover, GEP SMART is a unified procurement \nplatform that uses AI and NLP to conduct spend analysis, sourcing, and contract management. They \ncan help companies to obtain an enhanced understanding of their supplier contracts and procurement \ndata.\n4 Some companies develop in-house or third-party text analysis tools that integrate LLMs, such \nas GPT-3, to process unstructured textual data from various sources, including news, social media, \nand email, to extract insights relevant to SCM (Yenduri et al., 2023).\nHowever, the application of LLMs in SCM is still in its infancy, with limited academic literature \navailable on the topic. However, discussions on social media, articles, and blogs have touched upon \nits potential benefits, particularly in enhancing the effectiveness of SCM (Shrivastav, 2023). For \nexample, effective supply chain talent management is crucial amid disruptions and turnover, with \nstandardization proving challenging due to context-specific operations (Li et al., 2023b). LLMs, trained \nJournal of Global Information Management\nVolume 32 • Issue 1\n3\non internal data, such as emails, bridge knowledge gaps. LLMs enhance processes, data interpretation, \nhistorical context, and decision understanding. Furthermore, combining in-house LLMs with process \nmining streamlines data analysis, thereby boosting productivity.\n5 LLMs also provide functions such \nas event triggering and task automation, which are valuable for tasks like product code management \nand dynamic planning in SCM (Li et al., 2023a).\nGenerative AI has the potential to rapidly respond to fluctuating demand, thus accelerating \nprocurement and boosting revenue (Gill et al., 2022). It enhances real-time decision-making in \npurchasing and markdowns while fostering team collaboration for actionable strategies. LLMs, \nincluding generative AI, excel in handling unstructured text data. Unlike rule-based methods and \nNLP, which struggle with contract variability, LLMs automate tasks like contract clause extraction \nand data structuring, thereby reducing the reliance on costly legal expertise and facilitating specialized \nknowledge expansion.\n6 LLMs also offer versatile applications in SCM, including inventory, \nprocurement, route optimization, delivery, document management, and contingency planning. 7 \nNoteworthily, ChatGPT is revolutionizing SCM, offering automation, data insights, and process \noptimization. Manufacturers can leverage it to monitor their inventory, understand supply-demand \ndynamics, and enhance communication with suppliers and logistics partners for efficient raw material \nand product deliveries.\n8\nThe motivation for conducting this study was twofold. First, the rapid advancement of LLMs, \nexemplified by ChatGPT, has revolutionized AI (Kumar et al., 2023; Tsai et al., 2023). These models \nexhibit exceptional capabilities in the processing and generation of human-like text, which can \npotentially transform supply chain operations (Just, 2024). Second, the COVID-19 pandemic and \nother disruptive factors have underscored the need for agile and data-driven SCM. LLMs can enhance \nreal-time decision-making, automate tasks, and optimize various aspects of the supply chain (Liu et \nal., 2023; Li et al., 2023b). This research study aimed to bridge the gap between the evolving potential \nof LLMs and their scarce utilization in addressing the challenges and complexities of modern SCM \n(Raiaan et al., 2023). The study sought to fill this critical void, offering valuable insights into the \npractical applications of LLMs in the supply chain and fostering efficiency, accuracy, and innovation \nin this crucial domain of business operations. It did so by systematically examining themes related \nto LLM utilization in SCM. A diverse range of sources were analyzed, including academic literature \nand social media discussions, to uncover trends, usage patterns, and insights into present and future \ndevelopments. By employing multiple data sources, this study aimed to enhance the reliability and \nvalidity of its findings. The following research questions guided the study:\nRQ1. What are the prevalent applications of LLM in the supply chain domain, and what are the key \nthematic areas of utilization?\nRQ2. What are the antecedents, decisions, and outcomes linked to each application theme of LLM \nin the supply chain? Additionally, what are the prospective research trajectories in this domain?\nThis paper is divided into seven sections, the remainder of which are organized as follows. The \nsecond section presents the research methodology that was employed to conduct this study. Then, \nthe third section presents a review of the relevant literature, while the fourth section discusses the \nproposed framework. Next, the fifth section summarizes the theoretical contributions to the literature \nand the implications for management, while the sixth section presents the conclusions of the study. \nLastly, the seventh section describes the study’s limitations and provides directions for future research.\nRESEARCH METH oDoLoGy\nThe researcher and industry practitioner uses academic databases such as SCOPUS and WoS to conduct \nsystematic literature reviews and keyword analysis to synthesis the current and past status of a particular \ntopic (Williamson and Johanson, 2017). These databases contain peer-reviewed literature to covering \nJournal of Global Information Management\nVolume 32 • Issue 1\n4\na wide range of disciplines. In this study, we have used multiple data sources (data triangulation) \nincluding social media such as Twitter, LinkedIn, blogs, forums and peer-reviewed articles published \nin various academic databases to examine and explore the current status, topic and themes of use \nof LLM in SCM. Since the social media information include the opinion and observation of both, \nacademic researcher and industry practitioners (Wang et al., 2021), it provides a more authentic and \nwider facet of a LLM and its use in SCM.\nThis study is overall divided into two phases. During the first phase of the study, we used \npublished literature in peer-reviewed journals to derive the topic and theme using the python package \n“BERTopic” which combines BERT embedding with non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). \nDuring the second phase of the study, we used the “BERTopic” package to extract topic and themes \nfrom social media data. The final list of distinct themes is derived by combining the themes derived \nfrom social media and published literature on the use of LLM in SCM. In the end, the Antecedent, \ndecision, and outcome (ADO) framework (Paul & Cariado, 2020) is proposed for each theme. Figure \n1 depicts the flow of the study as below:\nTopic Modelling: BERT Embedding with Non-Negative Matrix \nFactorization (NMF) and Class-Based TF-IDF Topic Modelling\nBERT embeddings with NMF and Class-Based TF-IDF is a popular machine learning unsupervised \ntechnique for topic modelling (Grootendorst, 2022). This method handles complex and large-sized data \nefficiently. Researchers prefer to use this technique often on social media data where the amount of \nredundancy and complexity is always high (Sayed et al., 2023). We have used the BERTopic python \npackage to implement BERT embeddings with NMF and the steps are explained below:\nThe python package “BERTopic” process multiple steps in data processing including BERT \nembeddings, NMF and topic modelling (Grootendorst, 2022). In first step of data processing, BERT \nembeddings are used to map the context of each word of a sentence in a document through pre-\ntrained language model. Next, NMF method is used on these documents to reduce the dimension of \neach document derived from the first step. After reducing the dimension of each document, we have \nused BERTopic, which implement the class-based TF-IDF procedure to derive the optimal number \nFigure 1. Flowchart of the study\n(Source: Authors’ own work)\n\nJournal of Global Information Management\nVolume 32 • Issue 1\n5\nof topics. In essence, BERTopic generates document embedding with pre-trained transformer-based \nlanguage models, clusters these embeddings, and finally, generates topic representations with the \nclass-based TF-IDF procedure. Based on the distribution of keywords in a topic, a suitable theme is \nproposed (Grootendorst, 2022).\nLITERATURE ANAL ySIS\nTopics and Themes from Published Literature in Peer-Reviewed Journals\nIn this section, we have used “BERTopic” to extract topics from published literature on the application \nof LLM in SCM. We have followed the systematic process proposed by Mohamed et al. (2021) to \ncollect articles on the use of LLM for SCM. We have selected the peer-reviewed articles from two \npopular academic databases (SCOPUS and WoS), using appropriate keywords (refer to Figure 2) \non the topic. Since the LLM is a new technology, we have found the published article on this topic \nranging from 2020-23. Through manual check, we have discarded those articles which were redundant, \npublished in non-peer reviewed journals and duplicated to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the \nresults (Mohamed et al., 2021). Finally, we have found 33 published articles appropriate for topic \nmodelling and data collection process are described in Figure 2.\nThe title, abstract, and author keywords of the selected articles were used for topic modeling as \nthey contained valuable information about the articles (Hu et al., 2020). The title briefly summarizes \nFigure 2. Data collection process\n(Source: Authors’ own work)\n\nJournal of Global Information Management\nVolume 32 • Issue 1\n6\nthe main topic addressed in the article, while the abstract provides more detailed information about the \nresearch methods, results, and conclusions. Author keywords were also used for topic modeling, as they \nare a set of terms chosen by the authors to describe the main topics and themes covered in their article. \nFigure 3 presents a word cloud of published literature on the use of LLM in SCM. It helped to identify \nthe topics discussed in the articles. The words that appear most frequently in the word cloud indicate \nthe dominance of topics within the text. LLMs, SCM, inventory optimization, AI, NLP, automation, \nrobotics, and predictive modeling were among the dominant keywords in the published literature.\nTable 1 provides the frequency of keywords in all collected documents, which helped us to identify \nthe main topics and themes (refer to Figure 4) as well as the most important terms and phrases used.\nFigure 3.

The presence of “risk” as a keyword suggests that \nmanaging and mitigating risks within the supply chain is a key concern (Hendriksen, 2023). This \ncould encompass various types of risks, such as financial, operational, or logistical risks. Another \nimportant keyword, found in this analysis is “cost” that emphasizes about the cost of infrastructure \nto develop LLM for supply chain operations. Making investment in hardware and software for LLM \ninfrastructure within SCM require prior research, weighing the profits against the associated cost \n(De Bock et al., 2023). “Automation” is another keyword that appears during analysis. Published \nliterature on the topic data provides insights how LLM can be used for automation purpose within \nSCM to make the supply chain efficient, risk free and minimizing the human intervention. The last \nkeyword is “artificial intelligence” which is somehow connected with previous one. This keyword \nsuggests that AI jointly with LLM can be used for various purposes such as forecasting, optimization \nand automation. Overall these keywords provide initial insights and benefits of using Chabot, AI \nparticularly LLM for automation, minimize risk and increasing efficiency of supply chain process. \nTable 2 presents some of the popular studies on the use of LLM in SCM.\nTopics and Themes (Published Literature)\nThe selected articles on the application of LLMs in SCM were used to gain insights into the prevalent \nsubjects and discussions. Recognizing that abstracts, titles, and keywords typically encapsulate the \nmost valuable information within articles, this study leveraged these components from each article to \nextract overarching topics and themes. Using perplexity and coherence scores (Wahid et al., 2022), \nwe distilled four optimal topics from the collective body of published literature. These identified \ntopics are visually presented in Figure 4.\nBased on the keywords in each topic, a theme was proposed for each topic. They are presented \nin Figure 5.\nFour themes were identified from the published literature – namely “LLM and supply chain \nforecasting,” “LLMs for supplier relationship management,” “supply chain risk aversion using LLMs,” \nand “LLMs and supply chain modeling.” The four identified themes from the published literature \nrepresent specific areas of focus and application of LLMs in SCM.\nThe first theme, “LLM and supply chain forecasting,” concerns the use of LLMs for enhancing the \naccuracy and effectiveness of supply chain forecasting. LLMs are used to improve demand forecasting, \nsales predictions, and inventory management through NLP and text analysis of various data sources. \nThe primary focus is on harnessing LLMs to enhance precision and data-driven predictions in supply \nchain operations.\nThe second theme, “LLMs for supplier relationship management,” delves into the application of \nLLMs for managing and enhancing relationships with suppliers within the supply chain. This includes \nemploying LLMs for sentiment analysis, contract assessment, and communication optimization. The \nobjective is to improve communication, collaboration, and overall efficiency in supplier relationships \nthrough language models.\nThe third theme, “supply chain risk mitigation using LLMs,” revolves around using LLMs to \nmitigate the risks inherent in the supply chain. It involves using NLP and text analysis to evaluate and \nmanage risks associated with disruptions, geopolitical events, and other uncertainties. LLMs play a \npivotal role in identifying potential risks and formulating strategies for preventing or reducing their \nimpact on the supply chain. The fourth theme, “LLMs and supply chain modeling,” focuses on the \nintegration of LLMs into supply chain modeling and optimization. This entails the application of \nLLMs in mathematical modeling, simulation, and decision support systems for enhancing the overall \nefficiency and performance of supply chains. LLMs contribute to the creation of more accurate \nmodels, the optimization of network designs, and the facilitation of data-driven decision-making.\nJournal of Global Information Management\nVolume 32 • Issue 1\n8\nTable 2.

This study, \nwhile acknowledging limited empirical evidence, investigated the effects, \nchallenges, and trends associated with generative AI/ChatGPT in OSCM \nbased on data from 154 UK and 161 U.S. OSCM practitioners. The results \nhighlight increased efficiency as a key benefit for both adopters and \nnonadopters in both regions, alongside concerns regarding security, risks, \nand ethics. Generative AI/ChatGPT integration enhances overall supply \nchain performance, facilitated by organizational learning.\nFrederico (2023)\nRoute optimization, predictive maintenance, \norder shipment, customer and supplier \nrelationships, data analysis, ordering \nprocess, invoice automation, waste \nreduction, and workforce training and \nguidance, among others\nThe study offers an introductory perspective on ChatGPT’s applications \nand challenges in supply chains, drawing from initial evidence found in \nspecialized magazines, blogs, and company websites. Due to a lack of \nresearch papers on this topic in databases, a systematic literature review was \nnot feasible. This viewpoint provides practitioners in supply chain activities \nwith foundational insights into ChatGPT’s impacts and applications, aiming \nto inspire further research in this field.\nChowdhury et al. \n(2023)\nConversational AI systems and SCM \nsecurity\nThe application NLP has seen exponential growth specially in \nconversational AI systems like ChatGPT.

In addition, social media platforms such as Twitter and LinkedIn \nprovide a networking forum for professionals to connect, disseminate information, and stay up to \ndate on the latest developments (Muninger et al., 2022).\nWe compiled data from a diverse range of online outlets, encompassing platforms such as \nLinkedIn, Twitter, blogs, and forums dedicated to the application of LLM in supply chains. This data \ncollection process spanned 6 months and was driven by the specific keywords illustrated in Figure 6.\nData From Twitter\nAmong social media platforms, Twitter is highly favored among researchers and industry professionals. \nFor data collection, we used the following keywords to extract tweets through the Twitter API: “LLM \nand SCM,” “Large Language Models and Supply Chain Management,” “LLM and Supply Chain \nManagement,” “LLM and Supply Chain Management,” “Large Language Models and Supply Chain \nManagement,” and “LLM and Supply Chains.” Due to Twitter’s limitation in providing a set number \nof daily tweets (Russell, 2011), we engaged in continuous data collection over 6 months. Our analysis \ninvolved 3,241 tweets, facilitated by the Twitter API and the Python package Twipy.\nData From LinkedIn\nWeb scraping is a widely employed technique for retrieving data from web pages, and one of the \ngo-to tools for this purpose is the highly popular Python library “BeautifulSoup” (Russel, 2011; \nCortez et al., 2023). Using the keywords depicted in Figure 6, we embarked on a quest to compile \nposts and discussions regarding the use of LLMs in SCM. Notably, information on LinkedIn pages \ntends to be static in nature. Through our efforts, we successfully extracted approximately 21 posts \nand discussions from LinkedIn.\nFigure 6.

This pattern underscores the areas of prime focus and interest within this particular domain, \nthus shedding light on the pivotal aspects that drive conversations and shape perspectives on the role \nof LLMs in optimizing supply chain processes.\nTopics and Themes (Social Media, Blogs, and Forums)\nWe derived five optimal topics using the BERTopic Python library (Mustak et al., 2021). They are \ndepicted in Figure 8, and their graphical representation follows in Figure 9.\nFinal Themes From Both Databases\nWe found three themes from the published literature, while five themes were derived from social \nmedia data, as shown in Figure 10. Finally, we found four different themes based on these two \ndatabases (see Figure 10).\nThe role of LLMs, such as GPT-3 or similar AI-powered systems, has become increasingly \nsignificant in various domains, including SCM (AlZu’bi et al., 2022).\nThe automation of contract intelligence using language models significantly improves contract \nmanagement efficiency and provides the first theme of “LLM-driven automated contract intelligence.” \nLLMs can extract, categorize, and analyze contract clauses, terms, and conditions. They identify \npotential risks, opportunities, and obligations. Furthermore, they facilitate contract creation, revision, \nand compliance monitoring. This automation streamlines the contract lifecycle, reducing errors and \nenhancing legal and financial security. LLMs are invaluable for knowledge management in supply \nchains and represent the second theme of “LLM-driven supply chain knowledge management.” They \nhelp to catalog and extract insights from extensive documentation, such as regulations, contracts, and \nhistorical reports. This knowledge can be used to enhance decision-making, compliance, and process \noptimization. Additionally, language models enable supply chain professionals to quickly find and \nshare expertise, fostering collaboration and efficient problem-solving (Belhadi et al., 2022). Managing \nrisk and ensuring the security of supply chains is critical. Language models help to deal with the \nFigure 8. Topics and themes\n(Source: Authors’ own work)\n\nJournal of Global Information Management\nVolume 32 • Issue 1\n14\nthird theme, namely “LLM-driven supply chain risk and security management,” by continuously \nmonitoring information sources for potential risks. They can assess geopolitical developments, \nweather patterns, and market shifts, providing early warnings for possible disruptions (Singla et al., \n2023). Through analyzing legal documents and contracts, these models also enhance compliance \nand security by identifying potential issues in agreements or tracking cybersecurity threats (Singla \net al., 2023). Moreover, LLMs play a pivotal role in the fourth theme, namely “LLM-driven supply \nchain optimization,” by analyzing vast amounts of textual and numerical data. They assist in demand \nforecasting, inventory management, route optimization, and supplier selection. These models can \nprocess historical data, market trends, and even unstructured information from sources such as social \nmedia to refine decision-making (Yang et al., 2023b). Additionally, they provide real-time insights \ninto potential disruptions, helping supply chains to adapt swiftly.\nLLMs are instrumental in supply chain optimization, risk and security management, knowledge \nmanagement, and automated contract intelligence (Kar et al., 2023). Their ability to process \nFigure 9. Graphical representation of topics and themes\n(Source: Authors’ own work)\n\nJournal of Global Information Management\nVolume 32 • Issue 1\n15\nand understand vast volumes of data, both structured and unstructured, empowers supply chain \nprofessionals to make more informed decisions, mitigate risks, and optimize operations (Xu et al., \n2023). As these models continue to evolve, they will play an increasingly critical role in reshaping \nSCM practices and strategies.\nPRoPoSED ADo FRAME woRK FoR EACH THEMES\nThe Antecedent, Decision, Outcome (ADO) framework as given by Paul & Benito (2018) defines \nthe relationship between antecedents, decisions and the outcomes in a particular business situation. \nThis is an analytical framework which is useful in explaining the cause and effect relationships and \nits impact on outcomes. Antecedents are the factors that precedes the specific decisions. These factors \nmay be internal or external environmental conditions that may trigger a certain decision. In any \ngiven situation decisions are made on the basis of the factors or the antecedent identified. Decision \nleads to outcome. The outcome may be positive or negative in a given situation thereby impacting \nthe business (Paul & Benito, 2018). Understanding the relationship between the antecedents that \nleads to the decision is highly significant. Because, based on the decisions strategies are formulated \nwhich leads to a specific outcome. By understanding the cause and effect relationship between the \nantecedents and the decisions leads to formulate appropriate strategy to deal with challenges and \nmake the most of the situation.\nThis framework finds its application in various domains. The ADO framework provides \nresearchers and practitioners with useful insights into the relationship between the antecedents and \nhow they trigger the decision making process reaching to a particular outcome (Paul & Benito, 2018). \nThis framework allows the organizations to gauge the cause and effect aspect in order to make a \nFigure 10. Final emergent themes from the two databases\n(Source: Authors’ own work)\n\nJournal of Global Information Management\nVolume 32 • Issue 1\n16\nmore informed decision. Further, it allows them to analyze and assess the outcomes and the strategies \nadopted and take necessary corrective actions wherever required. Thus, this analytical approach \nequips the organizations to make the most of the opportunities available and to handle the challenges.\nTheme one: LLM-Driven Automated Contract Intelligence\nThe traditional supply chain contract management system deals with various issues pertaining to \nmanual handling of contracts, lack of centralized repositories, ensuring compliance with changing \nregulations and industry standards, scaling up, lacks proper communication and collaboration \n(Dubey et al. 2018). The first theme in the context of SCM signifies the incorporation of advanced \nAI-powered LLMs, such as GPT-3, for automating and enhancing contract-related procedures within \nsupply chain operations. Within this theme, the primary focus revolves around the use of LLMs to \nstreamline the administration of contracts in supply chain processes. The theme encompasses various \nvital aspects, including contract extraction and analysis, compliance and risk management, contract \ncreation and revision, contract monitoring, security and cybersecurity, efficiency improvement, \nand error reduction. This theme highlights the vast opportunity LLM driven automated contract \nintelligence system possesses in automating and optimizing supply chain contract process. This will \nlead to reimagining the supply chain contract management system using AI’s LLM capabilities. It \nempowers organizations to more efficiently handle contracts, reduce risks, ensure compliance, and \nultimately elevate the management of their supply chain operations.\nThe ADO framework for this theme is depicted in Figure 11. Top of FormThe ADO framework’s \nantecedents for theme 1 encompasses the relevant components that will lead to a successful automated \ncontract intelligence system (Hadi et al., 2023). On the basis of analysis, the antecedents identified \nincludes organization policies, internal contract documents, external data, regulatory and compliance \ninformation among others. To build an efficient automated contract intelligence system these \nantecedents provide the required building blocks. The factors or the antecedents identified through \nanalysis includes internal contract documents. This will require inputs from various data sources \nincluding the past and current contract papers and legal databases. These may be collated and stored \nin a central repository. These datasets will provide information on legal requirements, compliance \nrequirements particular to the sector, and contractual duties (Hadi et al., 2023; Mökander et al., 2023).\nFigure 11. ADO framework for theme one\n(Source(s): Authors’ own work)\n\nJournal of Global Information Management\nVolume 32 • Issue 1\n17\nAnother important factor or antecedent captured in the framework is the external market data along \nwith the regulatory and compliance information which gives the understanding of the market trends, \neconomic conditions and the industry dynamics this is crucial aspect in decision making (Mökander \net al., 2023; Eloundou et al., 2023). Therefore, to develop an automated contract intelligence system, \nthese antecedents play a critical role which has also to be consistent with organization objective and \ntechnical capabilities (Mökander et al., 2023; Eloundou et al., 2023; Wong et al., 2023). Additionally, \nfinancial reductions in the area of legal and contract management procedures are achieved; improved \nturnaround times indicate increased contract management efficiency; strong user training and intuitive \nuser interfaces promote user happiness; and user input and performance evaluations drive the iterative \nprocess of continual improvement, which keeps the system honed and optimized. The final step \nin achieving strategy alignment is to ensure that contract intelligence activities are aligned with \norganizational priorities. The ADO framework, in its entirety, provides a methodical approach to the \ninstallation and assessment of automated contract intelligence systems that contain LLMs, assuring \nthe achievement of expected outcomes while fitting with organizational goals (Tian et al., 2023).\nTheme Two: LLM-Driven Supply Chain Knowledge Management\nThe second theme embodies the application of advanced LLMs, such as GPT-3, in the realm of \nknowledge management specific to supply chain and logistics. This theme predominantly centers \non harnessing the potential of LLMs to facilitate the acquisition, organization, and application \nof knowledge within the context of supply chain operations. Key facets of this theme encompass \nknowledge extraction, cataloguing, and storage; decision support and insights; collaboration and \nexpertise sharing; and data-driven optimization. The ADO framework for this theme is depicted \nin Figure 12.\nThis themes focuses on the significance of capturing data and knowledge from various sources \nincluding internal and external knowledge repositories. By collating the data and integrating the \nLLMs into the supply chain knowledge management system and building effective knowledge \nretrieval systems will result in organizations making informed decisions. This will also initiate \nefficient collaboration among various stakeholders which was earlier not feasible due to a lack of \ndata and information sharing. By capitalizing on the capabilities of LLMs, organizations can enhance \ntheir management of supply chain knowledge, retain competitiveness, and navigate the ever-evolving \nlandscape of SCM more adeptly.\n9\nFigure 12. ADO framework for theme two\n(Source: Authors’ own work)\n\nJournal of Global Information Management\nVolume 32 • Issue 1\n18\nThe ADO paradigm offers a guide for LLM-driven supply chain knowledge management. It \ninvolves thinking about things such as data sources, which include both internal and external data \nstreams, as well as market reports and communication channels, in the antecedent phase. To simplify \ninformation organization and satisfy various user demands, it is necessary to employ user profiles \nand organized knowledge categories. To protect sensitive supply chain data, it is also essential to \nhave strong security and compliance rules. The system must be customized to fit the organization’s \nparticular supply chain scenario. The path to a complete LLM-enabled supply chain knowledge \nmanagement system is paved by these fundamental components. Several important decisions are \nmade during the framework’s decision-making phase. The LLM’s selection and configuration are \ncrucial; they entail selecting the best LLM for understanding supply chain data and configuring it \nto meet certain organizational requirements (Mökander et al., 2023). Additionally, choices are made \nabout data collection and integration, such as the choice of data sources to be combined and the \nfrequency of data collection. How supply chain insights are categorized, tagged, and organized inside \nthe system is guided by the structure of knowledge categorization and taxonomies. An intuitive and \nuser-friendly interaction experience is what user interface design and the implementation of natural \nlanguage search capabilities strive to provide. Real-time information on crucial supply chain events \nis made possible by the installation of an alerting and notification system (Ivanov & Dolgui, 2022).\nDecisions on customization and tailoring determine how the system will change to satisfy the \nparticular supply chain requirements of the organization. Decisions address security issues and \nspecify how confidential information will be handled to guarantee data security and compliance. \nAdditionally, methods for ongoing learning and adaptation are developed, allowing the system to \nchange in response to user interactions and shifting supply chain conditions. There also needs to be \nseamless collaboration and communication between the various stakeholders in the supply chain for \nefficient teamwork and sharing of information. These are the important drivers in implementing an \nLLM-driven supply chain knowledge management system in an organization which is in tandem with \nthe organizational objectives (Mikhailov, 2023).\nLLM-enabled supply chain knowledge management has the potential to improve decision-making \nand provide useful insights as it captures and stores the relevant supply chain data thereby improving \nsupply chain knowledge accessibility (Ganesh & Kalpana, 2022). The insights drawn can aid in \ndeveloping effective strategies which will help produce significant outcomes for the organization\n10. \nThe data captured will also aid in preempting any possible hazard or risk thereby, taking proactive \nmeasures to mitigate the risk. This will result in a risk minimization outcome.\nAnother important result is compliance assurance, which guarantees constant adherence to \nsupply chain-related laws and compliance standards while reducing operational and legal risks. \nAdditionally, it results in cost savings through efficiency improvements and well-informed decision-\nmaking. Additionally, user-friendly interfaces and automatic report summaries foster effective \ncooperation and improve communication among supply chain workers. Based on feedback and \nperformance assessments, the system continually develops and improves itself to maintain relevance \nand effectiveness. Ultimately, it will advance the organization’s mission by coordinating supply chain \nactivities with organizational aims and objectives. The ADO framework provides the necessary \nstructure and guidance to ensure that LLM-enabled supply chain knowledge management is not only \nwell-implemented but also capable of delivering the desired outcomes, serving as a valuable roadmap \nfor organizations that aim to harness the potential of LLMs for improved decision-making, efficient \nrisk mitigation, and significant cost reductions in SCM.\nTheme Three: LLM-Driven Supply Chain Risk and Security Management\nThe third theme signifies the use of advanced LLMs, such as GPT-3, to enhance and fortify risk \nassessment and security measures within the realm of SCM. The antecedents in the supply chain risk \nand security management’s ADO framework will be the internal and external data sources comprising \nhistorical contract data, supplier performance records, past risk incidents, identified vulnerabilities, \nJournal of Global Information Management\nVolume 32 • Issue 1\n19\nindustry-specific risk assessments, and global market shifts among others. By integrating LLM into \nthe supply chain risk and security management system will help identify the potential risks and take \nnecessary corrective measures. Thus, LLM capabilities empower organizations to draw insights \nfrom the input data and handle supply chain risks, enhancing security policies adeptly. This will \nfacilitate effective decision-making and avert crises (Richey et al., 2023). This will revitalize the \nSCM resilience in the face of potential challenges and threats. The ADO framework for this theme \nis depicted in Figure 13.\nThe ADO framework provides a structured way to conduct and evaluate LLM-driven supply \nchain risk and security management. The antecedent phase, includes a wide range of internal and \nexternal data sources that allow the system to access historical data, market reports, news sources, \nand real-time data streams. The user profiles of the employees working with the LLM system will \ninclude the compliance officials, security teams and supply chain managers (Barrett et al., 2023). \nThis will lead to the implementation of a robust security and compliance policy which will ensure the \neffective handling of the sensitive data (Mikhailov, 2023). Further, customization may be provided \nin the supply chain and security environment as per the requirement of the organization enabling a \ncustomized solution (Mikhailov, 2023).\nDecision phase includes the availability of various informed choices based on the antecedents. \nThe decisions will center around risk mitigation and strategy formulation. The first and foremost \ndecision is to select and implement the right LLM solution for catering to the organizational needs \n(Bi et al., 2013). This phase also defines the policy for data collection frequency, identifying the \nrelevant data sources and the integration techniques. The defined risk identification methodologies, \nwhich use criteria to identify possible supply chain hazards and security threats using keywords, \npatterns, and contextual clues, are equally crucial. An alert and notification process is appended \nto the system to provide real time alerts and notifications to take effective decisions to avert risks. \nPredictive analytics based on the historical data will be able to proactively anticipate the risks thereby, \nallowing necessary actions to be taken to handle the situation. It also trains the system on response \nplanning which generates plans in case of any eventuality. Data visualization and reporting tools aid \nin effective decision-making about active monitoring and regulatory adaptation which are driven \nby compliance and regulatory concerns. Therefore, the LLM-driven supply chain risk and security \nmanagement system develops effective risk mitigation strategies along with appropriate security \nmeasures to guard against any possible supply chain threats.\nFigure 13. ADO framework for theme three\n(Source: Authors’ own work)\n\nJournal of Global Information Management\nVolume 32 • Issue 1\n20\nImplementing LLM-integrated supply chain risk and security management will lead to significant \nand positive results (Singla et al., 2023). Implementing an appropriate risk mitigation strategy \nresults in improved supply chain risk and threat detection. Also, adherence to regulatory standards \nreduces legal and operational risks (Singla et al., 2023). Through predictive analysis, predictive \nrisk mitigation assists in foreseeing and managing hazards before they reach critical levels (Singla \net al., 2023; Mikhailov, 2023). In the outcome phase, the assessment of the risk mitigation strategy \nis performed. This phase will give an insight into the strategies that worked and if there were any \ngaps in the strategy that need to be addressed. Further, the results of the real-time monitoring and \nresponse system will be analyzed to check the efficiency of the system. The ongoing learning and \nadaptation will lead to the system’s improvement over time. The ADO framework will help strengthen \nthe organization’s supply chain security and resilience by implementing a risk management strategy \nleading to compliance assurance, and cost reduction. It provides the necessary structure and guidance \nto ensure the successful implementation of LLM-enabled supply chain risk and security management.\nTheme Four: LLM-Driven Supply Chain optimization\nThe ADO paradigm offers a formal framework for LLM-enabled supply chain optimization including \nantecedents like data sources, which include internal repositories that contain inventory data, \norder records, and supplier information, as well as outside sources such as market reports, weather \npredictions, and traffic data (Wang et al., 2023a). Historical supply chain data aid in developing \nbenchmarks and promoting trends. The organization’s objective generally includes cost reduction, \nspeedy delivery and enhanced inventory management all of which aim to optimize the supply chain. \nAs discussed in the previous themes, people who will be assigned to interact with the system will be \nthe supply chain managers, logistics professionals, and procurement officers who will be included \nin the user profiles. LLM-enabled supply chain optimization system can increase the supply chain \nefficiency leading to cost reduction and enhancement of the overall performance. The system leads to \naccurate demand forecasting, inventory levels are optimized, carrying costs are decreased, and cost-\neffectiveness is increased (Wang et al., 2023a). The system allows customization to include specific \norganizational needs and preferences. The LLM enables streamlining of operations by optimizing the \ntransportation and logistics processes thereby, leading to faster delivery and decreased transportation \ncost. The system also facilitates preparation to deal with emergencies due to the availability of data \nresulting in efficient risk mitigation. Real-time decision support helps organizations to become \nmore resilient by enabling them to act quickly and wisely in the face of supply chain difficulties and \ninterruptions. The ADO framework for this theme is depicted in Figure 14.\nFigure 14. ADO framework for theme four\n(Source: Authors’ own work)\n\nJournal of Global Information Management\nVolume 32 • Issue 1\n21\nIn the decision-making phase of the ADO framework for LLM enabled supply chain optimization, \nchoosing the right LLM, its configuration and implementation plays a crucial role. This leads to \nefficient analysis of supply chain data pertaining to specific optimization goal. Further selecting the \nappropriate data sources, frequency of collection and consolidation are included in the decision-making \nprocess. The system provides efficient demand forecasting, optimized inventory management, and \ntransportation and logistics optimization which leads to improved cost effectiveness and delivery dates. \nThe external variables play a significant role in minimizing supply chain risks, the LLM-enabled system \naids in the process by collating both internal and external data. The adoption of real-time decision \nsupport systems leads to efficient decision making offering prompt solutions for handling supply \nchain difficulties. The integration of process automation improves overall efficiency by streamlining \nregular operations and workflows. Thus the above decision choices lead to an effective LLM-enabled \nsupply chain optimization system aligned to organizational goals and objectives.\nThe output phase of the ADO framework assesses the impact of the supply chain optimization \nsystem. This phase evaluates the efficiency of the various optimization processes such as the accuracy \nof the demand forecasting system, optimized transportation and logistics process, and real-time \ndecision support system. The assessment will lead to identifying the gaps and improving the overall \nsystem. Therefore, implementing an LLM-enabled supply chain optimization system prepares \norganizations to flourish in a dynamic and highly competitive market.\nDISCUSSI oN\nTheoretical Implications\nThe introductory section poses two research questions that seek to address potential input variables, \nexplain how these inputs contribute, and offer theoretical background for model formulations.\nThe research question RQ1: “What are the prevalent applications of LLM in the supply chain \ndomain, and what are the key thematic areas of utilization?” is intended to reveal the current status \nof LLM in the context of the supply chain domain. RQ1 extensively investigate the application of \nLLM within the supply chain from various perspective including users, developers and managers. \nUnderstanding the significance of various input factors such as LLM capabilities, financial concerns \nfor developing technical infrastructure to implement LLM within the supply chain and aligning the \nLLM capabilities within the supply chain is explored in this analysis. Making ethical judgments \nabout input components in the establishment of theoretical frameworks for the use of LLM within \nthe supply chain requires an understanding of the features of LLM and related advantages and \nhow these can be mapped with various stages of the supply chain. Through an extensive synopsis \nof users’ viewpoints, exploring the current status of LLM within the supply chain and the state of \nthe field’s research, RQ1 offers a theoretical basis. The second research question RQ2: “What are \nthe antecedents, decisions, and outcomes linked to each application theme of LLM in the supply \nchain? Additionally, what are the prospective research trajectories in this domain?” investigates \nthe emergence and role of LLM within supply chain processes, explores the important factors, \nand possible solutions connected to each themes found in the implementation of LLM within \nsupply chain. The ADO framework that we have derived helps to explore the factors that precede \nthe implementation of LLM within supply chain processes and some of the factors identified by \nthe analysis are technological readiness, organizational culture, and data availability. The decision \ncomponent of the ADO framework helps in selecting the features of LLM and mapping them within \nthe supply chain for specific tasks. The outcome factor helps to measure the impact of LLM within \nthe supply chain and improves the overall supply chain performance.\nOur approach to reviewing the literature on the use of LLMs in SCM served two crucial purposes. \nFirst, we used NLP tools to analyze the discussion on the use of LLMs in the SCM literature, \nextracting valuable themes and insights (Srivastava & Bag, 2023). These themes significantly \nenhanced our understanding of current research and the complexities of the topic. Second, unlike most \nJournal of Global Information Management\nVolume 32 • Issue 1\n22\nreviews, which have relied heavily on scholarly research, our study took a more inclusive approach \nby integrating data from social media platforms such as Twitter, LinkedIn, blogs, and forums. By \nincluding social media data, this study accessed the latest challenges, benefits, and perspectives in \nthe use of LLMs in the SCM domain, particularly those from industry experts. These findings not \nonly built on existing literature reviews but also provided frameworks essential for each theme. They \noffer possible opportunities and help to understand constraints in the integration of LLMs into supply \nchain processes. Additionally, our study advances the theoretical foundations of the literature review \nprocess by introducing an innovative approach to the use of data triangulation.\nManagerial Implications\nThis study used data triangulation methodology and based on the analysis provides useful insights \non LLMs integration in the SCM. The study identified four themes which are presented in Figure \n10. The themes have been presented using the ADO framework which gives a detailed understanding \nof the various themes. These themes can be used by managers to understand the opportunities and \nchallenges of implementing LLM in various supply chain activities.\nThe “LLM-driven automated contract intelligence” theme provides insights into the contract \nmanagement process in supply chain operations. This can be used by managers to optimize the process \nof contract management. The insights drawn from the study can aid the managers in the following \nways. Firstly, LLMs can automate and optimize contract-related processes in supply chain activities. \nThey aid in data mining, classification, and analysis of contract clauses and the associated guidelines. \nThis helps the managers to automate the contract creation process. It also facilitates the updating of the \nexisting contracts. This results in accurate contracts that meet the required compliances. Secondly, an \nLLM-based system enables managers to access real-time data and gain insights into contract-related \ninformation facilitating effective decisions about supply chain trends. This will enhance the contract \nmanagement activity thereby, optimizing supply chain operations. Finally, collaboration with legal \nexperts and contract management specialists is important for the optimized working of the contract \nmanagement system. This can be seamlessly integrated into LLM’s contract management system \nmaking the system more effective. This integration will streamline contract management activity. \nThis in turn improves the efficiency of the process and reduces the scope of errors. Thus, LLM \nintegration in the contract management process allows managers to draw insights from the data and \nidentify potential risks and opportunities in real-time (Wong et al., 2023).\n“LLM-driven supply chain knowledge management,” theme provides insights into knowledge \nmanagement aspects related to supply chain operations. This theme highlights the identification \nand capture of knowledge from various sources including contracts and regulations along with \nhistorical reports by integrating LLMs. Supply chain managers can draw insights from this knowledge \nextracted. This theme can help the managers in the following ways. Firstly, LLMs can mine a vast \namount of data including structured and unstructured data and provide useful actionable insights \nto the managers aiding informed decision-making (Fernandez et al., 2023). This will also support \nmanagers to develop effective strategies related to supply chain activities. Secondly, LLMs allow \neasy knowledge dissemination thereby, promoting knowledge sharing among various stakeholders \nin the supply chain domain and leading to strategic collaboration. LLM integration can further foster \na culture of knowledge sharing within the organization promoting the exchange of expertise and \nknowledge. The LLM-based supply chain knowledge management system enhances productivity by \nproviding fast and real-time access to the required information, thus streamlining workflows. Finally, \nintegrating LLMs promotes a culture of continuous learning and sharing, which results in optimizing \nthe supply chain leading to organizational growth.\nSupply chain operations are exposed to various risks and security threats that can bring \nabout supply chain disruption. The “LLM-driven supply chain risk and security management,” \ntheme provides managers with an opportunity to identify and mitigate the risk in real-time. LLM \nJournal of Global Information Management\nVolume 32 • Issue 1\n23\nintegration will help the managers in the following ways. Firstly, the vast amount of data allows \nLLM systems to predict and monitor potential risks and the insights drawn from the analysis of \ndata facilitate risk mitigation. Diverse data sources including internal and external data sources, \nenvironmental factors, and market trends can be analyzed by LLM based system. This allows \nthe system to preempt and notify possible disruptions allowing managers to take swift action. \nSecondly, LLM can do real-time tracking and monitoring of security threats thereby, providing \nmechanisms to mitigate the threats, protect the sensitive data and safeguard the supply chain \noperations. Real-time insights enable timely and informed decisions to be made, challenges to \nbe effectively addressed, and their impact to be minimized. The integration of LLMs into risk \nand security management provides supply chains resilience. Finally, These models offer valuable \ninsights into risk factors and vulnerabilities, thereby enabling organizations to establish more \nrobust and flexible supply chain networks. LLMs also facilitate the monitoring and enforcement \nof regulatory compliance, which is a pivotal aspect of risk and security management. Achieving \nthe effective implementation of LLMs necessitates close collaboration with data scientists and \ncybersecurity experts.\nThe “LLM-driven supply chain optimization,” theme enables managers to optimize supply chain \noperations. Firstly, LLMs can analyse the vast amount of structured and unstructured data along with \nthe past historical data to provide insights leading to effective demand forecasting (Yang et al., 2023b). \nSecondly, by enabling real time data LLM helps in accurate predictions thereby, leading to optimized \ninventory management. Finally, LLMs facilitate the real-time optimization of delivery routes. This \nhelps in minimizing transportation costs factoring various constraints such as traffic conditions and \nweather forecasts. Also, by evaluating supplier performance, costs, and reliability (Yang et al., 2023a) \nLLMs empower managers in supplier selection and contract negotiations.\nEarly Integration of LLMs into supply chain activities of any organization will provide a \ncompetitive advantage. The benefits in capturing and processing of vast amount of real time data \nwill enable responsive supply chain management system. This will make the organization agile and \neffective in supply chain operations. Further, investment in AI technology and hiring or collaborating \nwith data scientist is critical for the success of such an initiative.\nCoNCLUSI oN\nThis comprehensive study conducted an extensive literature analysis to investigate previous research \non LLM usage in SCM and to identify relevant topics and themes. The study employed a triangulation \napproach, incorporating data from diverse sources such as peer-reviewed articles as well as social media \nplatforms, including Twitter, LinkedIn, blogs, forums, and industry reports. The dataset comprised \n33 peer-reviewed articles and over 3,400 discussions, expert opinions, and articles shared by SCM \nspecialists across various social media platforms. Figure 10 visually presents the final themes derived \nfrom this amalgamated dataset.\nFurthermore, this study systematically addressed two research questions. RQ1 was as follows: \n“What are the prevalent applications of LLM in the supply chain domain, and what are the key \nthematic areas of utilization?”. This question was addressed by identifying themes using both published \nliterature and data from social media platforms, such as Twitter, LinkedIn, blogs, industry reports, \nand forums. RQ2 was as follows: “What are the antecedents, decisions, and outcomes linked to \neach application theme of LLM in the supply chain? Additionally, what are the prospective research \ntrajectories in this domain?”. To address this question, this study formulated an ADO framework for \neach theme in the fourth section and highlighted future research directions in the seventh section. A \nnoteworthy observation is the prevalent focus of social media discussions on LLMs’ role in creating a \nmore ethical, transparent, and trustworthy supply chain, while published literature has predominantly \ndelved into tools and algorithm-related issues.\nJournal of Global Information Management\nVolume 32 • Issue 1\n24\nLIMITATIoNS AND FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTI oNS\nThe themes of “LLM-driven automated contract intelligence,” “LLM-driven supply chain \nknowledge management,” “LLM-driven supply chain risk and security management,” and “LLM-\ndriven supply chain optimization” are closely interconnected, representing various aspects of \nSCM. These themes work like a orchestra to enhance the overall efficiency and effectiveness \nof supply chains.\nFor instance, LLM-driven automated contract intelligence (Theme 1) simplifies contract \nmanagement and contributes to improved supply chain optimization (Theme 4). Moreover, \nLLM-driven supply chain knowledge management (Theme 3) complements risk and security \nmanagement (Theme 3) by offering crucial insights and data for well-informed decision-\nmaking, particularly in the demesne of risk management. Furthermore, all of these themes \npivot on data and information. LLM-driven supply chain knowledge management (Theme 2) \nconcentrates on effective data and knowledge management, which is critical for risk assessment \nand mitigation (Theme 3) and the optimization of supply chain processes (Theme 4). These \ninterrelated themes explore the potential, threats, challenges, and technical requirements for \nthe successful implementation of LLMs in SCM. They can serve as input or output factors \nfor future research, enabling the exploration of linear or nonlinear relationships. Empirical \nvalidation through case studies is an avenue for future research. More explicitly, the future \nresearch directions based on each theme are provided in Table 5.\nAs the use of LLM in business are increasing specially from Gen-AI side, it offers both opportunity \nand challenges to supply chain managers (Buthelezi et al., 2021). Since this study has dealt with \nsecondary data only, to explore the issues of implementation, future research can collect primary \ndata also from various stakeholders to deepen their comprehension and opinion. Primary data would \nprovide a clearer perspective of stakeholders and may help in enhancing the generalizability of the \noutcome of this study.\nTable 5. Future research directions for each theme\nThemes Future Research Directions\nLLM-driven automated \ncontract intelligence\nThis theme paves the way for future research aimed at enhancing and broadening \nLLM potential in contract analysis and automation. Subsequent studies may delve \ninto methods for improving the precision and effectiveness of contract review, the \nidentification of potential risks, and the automation of everyday contract-related tasks. \nMoreover, research within this domain can explore the legal and practical consequences \nassociated with the growing reliance on automated contract intelligence.\nLLM-driven supply chain \nknowledge management\nThe future researcher may investigate and develop adoption models for LLM in \nknowledge management within the supply chain. Also, the researcher may work on tools \nand techniques which can effectively extend the essential knowledge of the supply chain \nprocess to each actor of the supply chain using LLM.\nLLM-driven supply \nchain risk and security \nmanagement\nThe future researcher may develop a model which can measure and mitigate \nsupply chain risks using LLM. Also using these models, research may also like to \ninvestigate significances of AI-informed decision-making on supply chain security. \nAnother important area where future researchers can delve into the legal and ethical \nconsiderations for LLM-driven risk management in supply chain processes.\nLLM-driven supply chain \noptimization\nFuture researchers could focus on leveraging the features of LLM to optimize supply \nchain operations. Also, researchers may investigate how business can use LLM with \nAI to enhance demand forecasting, inventory management, and logistics optimization. \nAnother important area is about managing the legal and compliance related issues in use \nof LLM within supply chain.\n(Source: Authors’ own compilation)\nJournal of Global Information Management\nVolume 32 • Issue 1\n25\nCoNFLICT oF INTEREST\nThe authors declare that they have no known financial or personal interests which can impact the \nwork presented in this study.\nFUNDING\nThis study did not receive any grant from a funding agency in the public, commercial, or not-for-\nprofit sectors.\nJournal of Global Information Management\nVolume 32 • Issue 1\n26\nREFERENCES\nAlZu’bi, S., Mughaid, A., Quiam, F., & Hendawi, S.
