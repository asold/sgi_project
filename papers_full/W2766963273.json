Our “behavior systems” approach will serve as a foundation for the future testing of the motivational basis \nof stone handling. Additionally, a comparison of 39 stone handling patterns performed by three macaq ue species (M. \nfascicularis, M. fuscata and M. mulatta) showed overlapping behavioral propensities to manipulate stones; however, \nthe differences suggest that long-tailed macaques might be more prone to use stones as percussive tools in a foraging \ncontext. This work could offer insights into the development and evolution of complex activities such as percussive \nstone tool use in early humans. \n \nKeywords – Object play, Percussive tool use, Behavior systems, Motivation, Foraging, Ethogram  \n \n \n  \n“What we need are more detailed observations of play from the viewpoint of the various systems \ninvolved within what seems to be a single kind of play …” (Burghardt, 2005, p. 137). Despite the lack of \na definitional and theoretical consensus, object-oriented play is known to occur in numerous mammal and \nbird species (Fagen, 1981; Power, 2000). For the purpose of this study, object play will be defined as the \nspontaneous, repeated, seemingly relaxed, incompletely functional, and usually solitary manipulation of \n                                                                        Pelletier et al.   456 \n \ninanimate objects, which differs structurally, sequentially, and contextually from more serious versions of \nobject handling (Bjorklund & Pellegrini, 2002; Burghardt, 2005; Hall, 1998). Research on object play \nbehavior in non -human primates has key implications for the development of foraging competence, the \nmotivation underlying tool use, and the evolution of material culture in humans (Parker & Gibson, 1977; \nRamsey & McGrew, 2005). The development of ethograms across a wider range of species is an \nimportant first step to better understanding object play. Because object play is rarely observed in adult \nanimals – with the exception of some domestic species and captive individuals (Hall, 1998) – more \ndetailed descriptions of adult animals playing with non -edible objects ar e also needed. Such data would \naid in determining what actions are specific to play and which actions arise from immaturity when \nperformed by young animals. \nStone handling (SH) is one of the few types of object play routinely performed throughout an \nindividual’s lifespan in both captive and free -ranging groups, and has been described in four closely \nrelated species of macaques: Japanese macaques ( Macaca fuscata), rhesus macaques ( M. mulatta), long-\ntailed macaques ( M. fascicularis), and Taiwanese macaques ( M. cyclopis, Nahallage, Leca, & Huffman, \n2016). SH consists of the non -instrumental manipulation of stones in various ways (e.g., clacking two \nstones together or rubbing stones on a substrate), and is structurally complex: the stones may be \nmanipulated in c ombination with other objects (including edible ones, like fruits and leaves) and may \ninvolve various other body parts than just the hands (e.g., feet, mouth; Leca, Gunst, & Huffman, 2008). In \nfree-ranging provisioned groups of Japanese macaques, SH has be en motivationally linked to foraging \ndue to the similarities in the actions performed and the temporal association between these two object -\noriented activities (Leca et al., 2008 a). Additionally, SH is probably the best -known example of non -\nadaptive and cu lturally-transmitted behavior in non -human primates (Leca, Gunst, & Huffman, 2012). \nOverall, SH is an ideal candidate behavior to examine the motivational processes underlying object play \nfrom a cross-species comparative perspective. \nThe first objective of  this study was to contribute to the limited descriptive database of object \nplay activities in both young and adult monkeys by providing a comprehensive written and video -\nillustrated SH ethogram in long -tailed macaques. The long -tailed macaque is an excell ent candidate \nspecies to make this contribution, as one of the subspecies (i.e., Burmese long -tailed macaque, Macaca \nfascicularis aurea) is known for its manual dexterity and routine stone tool use skills in an extractive \nforaging context (Gumert, Kluck, & Malaivijitnond, 2009).  \nOur second objective was to propose a “foraging substitute” hypothesis for the motivation \nunderlying the expression of SH in this species. In line with previous research on Japanese macaques \n(Leca et al., 2008 a), we suggest that SH  consists of performing foraging -like actions on non -edible \nobjects (i.e., stones) because this activity involves motivational processes typically associated with \nforaging. To explore this hypothesis, we used a “behavior systems” approach. This approach al lows for \nthe descriptive grouping of activity -specific behavioral patterns under multi -level, interrelated and \nhierarchically nested perceptual, central, and motor units, by inferring stimulus processing modules and \nmore integrated internal states or motiv ational modes, which originate from a few major functional \nbehavior systems (e.g., foraging, defense, sex/reproduction, parental care, socializing, and body care; \nTimberlake, 2001).  \nOur third objective was to compare the SH patterns performed by long -tailed macaques with the \nSH ethograms available for Japanese macaques (Leca, Gunst, & Huffman, 2007) and rhesus macaques \n(Nahallage & Huffman, 2008). Cross -species comparative analysis is one of the most powerful \nmethodological tools to explore the origins and  evolution of biological features (Martins, 1996). This \napproach is particularly useful to reconstruct scenarios for the evolutionary history of behavioral traits, \nwhich do not leave any direct fossil traces. It can be used to decide whether similar behavi oral patterns \nare due to common ancestry or the result of independent adaptations to similar environmental pressures \n(Martins, 1996). Such a comparative approach should be relevant to understanding the evolution of object \nplay behavior because it can disti nguish adaptive from non-adaptive traits by indicating which ones have \npredated, accompanied, or followed the modification of some of their structural and functional attributes. \nThe lack of functional constraints, and thus the flexibility and versatility o f SH activity, makes it a good \n                                                                        Pelletier et al.   457 \n \ncandidate for cross-species comparative analysis. If SH is most reliably assigned to the foraging behavior \nsystem in the long -tailed macaques, and the SH ethograms vary across these three macaque species, one \ncould test wheth er this variation in object play behavior reflect s inter-specific differences in foraging \nstrategies. We put a special emphasis on the cross -species comparison of percussive SH patterns. Indeed, \na higher diversity in percussive SH patterns and more frequen t percussive stone-tool using in long -tailed \nmacaques than in the other two macaque species could indicate differential adaptive foraging styles in \nrelation to the behavioral propensity to manipulate stones.  \n \nMethods \n \nStudy Site \n \nThe study site was locate d at the Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary, Ubud (central Bali, \nIndonesia). The study population was composed of five neighboring groups of Balinese long -tailed \nmacaques ( Macaca fascicularis fascicularis ), totaling approximately 600 individuals. In this study , we \nfocused on one group (called “Cemetery”), totaling 136 individuals. The monkeys were free -ranging \nwithin the temple grounds and provisioned with fruits and vegetables by the temple staff twice daily. \n This research was exclusively observational and no n-invasive, and followed all Indonesian laws \nfor foreign research. Our study was conducted in accordance with the Indonesian Ministry of Research \nand Technology, the Provincial Government of Bali, and the local district authorities, and approved by \nour federally mandated institutional animal welfare committee. \n \nData Collection Procedure \n \n  During three weeks in August 2008, between 09:00 hours and 18:00 hours, CADN, MAH and \nJBL used two main observational sampling methods: continuous focal -animal sampling a nd ad libitum \nsampling (Altmann, 1974). All focal and ad libitum samples were video -recorded with Sony digital video \ncameras (DCR-TRV22 and DCR-TRV33). Overall conditions of visibility were ideal for obtaining good \nquality video.  Whenever possible, the su bjects were filmed from the front or side, within 3  - 5 m, and \nabout 2 m square in  frame. A total of 62.7 hrs (i.e., 55.9 hrs of focal and 6.8 hrs of ad libitum samples) \nwere collected from a representative subset of the population including all age and se x classes (namely, \nmale and female infants, juveniles, and adults). Focal subjects were randomly selected, independently of \ntheir activities, and the age and sex class with least cumulative data was given priority. We followed \nHuffman’s (1996) protocol, wh ich previously determined that the optimal time period to record a \ncomplete SH bout of a randomly selected individual after feeding time was 15 min. If the focal individual \nperformed SH activity during the last 2 min of this 15  min period, the observation was extended for \nanother 5 minutes before ending, unless SH was still in progress. \n \nData Analysis \n \nIn 2016, ANP used The Observer XT 12 (by Noldus) software to score the start and end time of \neach SH pattern down to the second, from a total of 14.0 hrs of video-recorded SH activity. For the \nquantitative analyses of Balinese long -tailed macaques presented in this study, we used a sample of 7.3 \nhrs of SH performed by 75 individuals from all age/sex classes, which represented 205 SH bouts. The \nbasic unit of an alysis that we employed to establish the SH ethogram was the SH pattern: a single, non -\ninstrumental, stone -directed, and specifically defined manipulative action (see Appendix for a \ncomprehensive list of distinct SH patterns in Balinese long -tailed macaques). We used The Observer XT \n12 duration-sequence option to assess intra-scorer reliability for ANP when transcribing the same samples \nof SH video-records twice, involving a total of 15.6 min of video containing SH activity, with a total of \n78 SH patterns performed (k = 0.99; Martin & Bateson, 1993).  \n                                                                        Pelletier et al.   458 \n \nTo visually demonstrate the rate at which new SH patterns were identified over the course of \nobservation time, we generated two behavior discovery curves – one generated from our focal sample and \none from our ad libitum sample – by mapping the cumulative corresponding timecode (x -axis) at which \nall SH patterns first appeared (y-axis), using the order in which the videos were originally scored (Figures \n1 and 2). In order to assess the completeness of the behavior al repertoire of SH patterns, we created an \nasymptotic model describing the relationship between the sampling effort and the observation of new SH \npatterns via a derivation of the Clench equation: S(t) = at/(1 + bt) (Soberón & Llorente, 1993), where t is \na measure of effort, a is the rate of increase at the beginning of sampling, and b is the accumulation of \nbehavioral acts. After adjusting this equation to our data, we estimated the maximum theoretical number \nof SH patterns in our study group by calculatin g a/b and the proportion of observed SH patterns (Dias, \nRangel-Negrín, Covohua-Fuentes, & Canales-Espinosa, 2009). \n \n \nFigure 1. Behavior discovery curve representing the observed and predicted cumulative numbers of SH patterns obtained from \nfocal data as a function of observation time. \n \n \nFigure 2. Behavior discovery curve representing the observed and predicted cumulative numbers of SH patterns obtained from ad \nlibitum data, as a function of observation time. \n \n                                                                        Pelletier et al.   459 \n \nTo reduce the possible effect of behavioral id iosyncrasy on the SH behavior discovery curve, we \nsampled a large number of individuals performing SH, from all age and sex classes. Indeed, a previous \nstudy aiming to establish the ethogram of red pandas ( Ailurus fulgens fulgens) and using a similar model  \nshowed that, if the total number of observation hours exceeds the number of animals observed, and if the \ndegree of behavioral idiosyncrasy in the population is relatively low, the number of behaviors observed \nper hour increases at a more rapid rate when o bserving several animals within an observation time than \nwhen observing one single animal for the same length of time. In other words, it is better to observe more \nindividuals in any given observation period than one individual for a long period of time (J ule, Lea, & \nLeaver, 2009). Our study met these two requirements. First, 73 individuals (i.e., 97% of identified stone \nhandlers in the Cemetery group) were sampled over 55.9 hrs to generate the curve based on focal data, \nand 22 individuals (i.e., 29% of identified stone handlers) were sampled over 6.8 hrs to generate the curve \nbased on ad libitum data (Figure 2). Second, we aimed to establish the ethogram of SH, a cultural \nbehavior with relatively low levels of idiosyncrasy (cf. Leca et al., 2007). \nTo conduc t a cross -species comparison of SH with the genus Macaca, we used previously \npublished data on the SH behavior in Japanese macaques and rhesus macaques. The first data set was \ncollected in 2004, in the free -ranging provisioned group of Japanese macaques, t otaling 141 individuals \nliving at the Iwatayama Monkey Park, Arashiyama, Kyoto Prefecture, Japan ( cf. Leca et al., 2007). For \nthe quantitative analyses of Japanese macaques presented in this study, we used a sample of 7.1 hours of \nSH performed by 63 indivi duals from all age/sex classes, which represented 149 SH bouts. The second \ndata set was collected in 2004, in the captive group of rhesus macaques, totaling 29 individuals housed in \nan outside enclosure at the Kyoto University Primate Research Institute, Inuyama, Japan (cf. Nahallage & \nHuffman, 2008). For the quantitative analyses of rhesus macaques presented in this study, we used a \nsample of 5.2 hrs of SH performed by 29 individuals from all age/sex classes, which represented 103 SH \nbouts. \nTo investigate possible differences in the occurrence (i.e., presence/absence) of each of the 39 SH \npatterns (i.e., dichotomous nominal data) across three macaque species (namely, M. fascicularis , M. \nmulatta, and M. fuscata), we used a Cochran's Q test, followed by a ser ies of post-hoc paired McNemar’s \ntests. The qualitative comparison of percussive SH patterns (namely, Clack, Flint, Pound, Pound -Drag, \nSlap, Slap -Roll, Swipe, and Tap; Appendix) was based on the occurrence of these eight SH patterns \nacross the three macaqu e species. The quantitative comparison of percussive SH patterns could be done \nonly between M. fascicularis and M. fuscata. To compare the relative frequency of percussive SH patterns \n(i.e., how often percussive SH patterns were performed in a given SH bou t, relative to other SH patterns) \nand the relative duration of percussive SH patterns (i.e., how long percussive SH patterns were performed \nin a given SH bout, relative to other SH patterns) between the two species, we used Mann -Whitney U \ntests. To compare the prevalence of percussive SH (i.e., how many group members engaged in this form \nof object play) between the two species, we used a 2 x 2 contingency chi -square test. For statistical \nanalyses, we used IBM SPSS Statistics 24 ©. Because none of our predict ions were directional, we \nconducted two-tailed tests. Significance levels were set at α = 0.05. \n \nResults \n \nSH Ethogram \n \nThe SH ethogram of the Balinese long -tailed macaques of Ubud included 36 behavioral patterns \n(Appendix; Figure 3). Descriptions and comme nts were included for each SH pattern. For clarity and \nsimplicity, descriptions defined the actions as if they were performed using only one stone, even though \nmost SH patterns could be performed using more than one stone. Corresponding videos were included in \nsupplementary materials. The SH ethogram is available at:  https://youtu.be/oRDvBbywJus. Examples of \nSH sequences are available at: https://youtu.be/MvvSg5Jo3JE \n \n                                                                        Pelletier et al.   460 \n \n \n \nFigure 3.

(Photos by J.-B. Leca). \n \nTo assess the completeness of the SH ethogram, we fit the observed cumulative number of newly \nscored SH patterns over the course of observation time with the predi cted discovery curve for both focal \nsamples (Figure 1) and ad libitum samples (Figure 2). The fit of our data to the Clench equation was very \ngood for both the focal data ( r² ≥ 0.96) and the ad libitum  data ( r² ≥ 0.98). Most SH patterns were \ndiscovered within the first hour of video recording for both sampling methods and the number of new \nbehavioral patterns discovered decreased with more hours of observation. We found 35 behavioral \npatterns from the focal data, which closely matched (99.3%) the expected t heoretical number of 35.3 (a = \n49.448, b = 1.402). Likewise, we found 34 behavioral patterns from the ad libitum data , also closely \nmatching (96.8%) the expected theoretical number of 35.1 (a = 70.139, b = 1.997). These two curves \nrevealed a plateau at 22. 3 and 5.2 hrs of observation, respectively. Overall, we exceeded the minimum \nthreshold of completeness for the SH ethogram in this group (i.e., 90%; Dias et al., 2009). Thus, the \nbehavior discovery curves (Figure 1 and Figure 2) provide evidence that this comprehensive ethogram is \nrepresentative of the SH patterns performed in the Ubud population of long-tailed macaques in 2008. \n \n“Behavior Systems” Approach to SH \n \nIn order to explore the motivational processes underlying the SH activity, we utilized a “beha vior \nsystems” approach (Timberlake, 2001). We provided the best possible descriptive correspondence \nbetween each of the 36 SH behavioral patterns and upper-level perceptual and central units from the most \nlikely behavior system that has been previously ass ociated with SH in macaques, namely the foraging \nbehavior system (Huffman & Quiatt, 1986; Leca et al., 2008a; Figure 4). Based on the behavioral \nrepertoire of the long -tailed macaques (Brotcorne, 2014), we found that all 36 SH patterns could most \nreliably be categorized in a nested and hierarchically organized foraging behavior system, including all \nthe typical motivational modes characteristic of the chronological sequence of this activity, namely food \nsearch, food investigation, food processing, food extraction, and food consumption (Figure 4).  \n                                                                        Pelletier et al.   461 \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 4.

For this comprehensive SH ethogram in long -tailed macaques, SH patterns were \nspecifically examined in relation to the precise movement being performed by the body parts executing \nthe action (i.e., the hands or feet), rather than classifying SH patterns solely on the objects and body parts \ninvolved. Because long-tailed macaques often incorporate various objects and body parts into their SH \nactivities (e.g., “Tap” on foot, groin, leg, tail; Pelletier, Huffman, Nahallage, Gunst, & Leca, 2016), this \nmethod allowed us to create a smaller but more precise reper toire that labeled the behavioral patterns as \ngeneral categories rather than splitting them when the general action being performed was the same (e.g., \n“Rub” includes patterns that involve a stone being moved back and forth along a substrate, and contains \nthe previously labeled patterns: “Rub in mouth,” “Rub with mouth,” “Rub/put on fur,” and “Stone -\ngroom”). \nTable 1  shows how the previously labeled SH patterns ( cf. Leca et al., 2007; Nahallage & \nHuffman, 2008) not included in this ethogram have now been categorized. Previous patterns such as  \n“Insert into cavity,” “Wash,” “Combine with objects,” and “Flint in mouth,” were represented under \nbroader categories based on the specific actions being performed by the hands or feet. These SH patterns \nwere also prese nt in long -tailed macaques; however, because our study group lives in a highly \nanthropogenic environment (Brotcorne, 2014), these monkeys have been observed to perform numerous \nSH patterns in combination with a variety of objects other than stones, includi ng vegetal materials and \nhuman-made items (e.g., “Cover” with leaves, grass, cloth; “Pound” on leaf, nut, plastic; Pelletier et al., \n2016), the previous method of classification would have led to a long and potentially confusing ethogram \n(e.g., “Cover with  leaf,” “Cover with cloth,” “Cover with grass,” “Cover with plastic”). This systematic  \nmethod of classification prevented us from generating an ethogram that would have been either too \ngeneral (e.g., “Combine with object” which could contain different act ions such as “Cover” or “Wrap”), \ntoo specific (e.g., “Wrap with leaf,” “Wrap with plastic”), or based on environmental factors including the \nobjects or substrates involved (e.g., “Wash” and “Rub With Hands” were patterns in which the actions \nperformed are the same, only the presence of water distinguishes them from one another). Because \ninserting stones into a cavity could also be viewed as the previously categorized pattern, “Combine with \nobjects” (e.g., a bamboo stalk used as the cavity the stones are being inserted into and removed from), and \nbecause this action can be performed in a number of different ways by both the same individual, and \nbetween individuals, this previously identified category has now been categorized according to how the \naction is bei ng performed (i.e., “Insert into cavity” frequently resembles a combination of the actions \n“Pick and drop” when the stone is dropped into a bamboo stalk, and “Gather” when the stone is then \nretrieved).  \nFrom this new categorization, a list of 39 distinct S H patterns was generated. Of the 39 SH \npatterns, 36 were present in long -tailed macaques, 31 in Japanese macaques and 17 in rhesus macaques \n(Table 1). The occurrence of these 39 SH patterns significantly differed across the three macaque species \n(Cochran's Q (2) = 26.4, p < 0.001). Post -hoc paired comparisons showed significant differences in the \nSH repertoires of M. mulatta and M. fascicularis (McNemar’s test, p < 0.001), and that of M. mulatta and \nM. fuscata (p < 0.001). The size of the SH repertoire of M. mulatta was about half as large as that of M. \nfascicularis and M. fuscata, and there was no SH pattern that was present in M. mulatta and absent in M. \nfascicularis or M. fuscata . The SH repertoires of M. fascicularis  and M. fuscata did not differ \nsignificantly in profile (McNemar’s test, p = 0.227), nor in size (Table 1). \nLong-tailed macaques showed a higher diversity in percussive SH patterns than Japanese and \nrhesus macaques. Among the eight percussive SH patterns documented in the genus Macaca to date, M. \nfascicularis performed seven ( namely, Clack, Flint, Pound, Pound -Drag, Slap, Slap -Roll, and Tap), M. \nfuscata three ( Flint, Pound, and Swipe), and M. mulatta  one (Clack; Appendix). Even though M. \n                                                                        Pelletier et al.   463 \n \nfascicularis and M. fuscata did not differ significantly in the duration of SH bouts (mean ± SD, 2.2 ± 3.2 \nmin and 2.9 ± 3.7 min, respectively; Mann-Whitney U test, U = 13405, p = 0.050), percussive SH patterns \nwere significantly more frequent ( U = 7199, p < 0.001) and lasted significantly longer ( U = 7146, p < \n0.001) in M. fascicularis  than in M. fuscata . Although M. fascicularis  and M. fuscata  did not differ \nsignificantly in the prevalence of SH activity (55.1% and 44.7% of sampled individuals performed SH, \nrespectively; χ2(1)= 3.03, p = 0.082), the prevalence of percussive SH patterns was significantly higher in \nM. fascicularis than in M. fuscata (74.7% and 4.8% of sampled stone handlers performed percussive SH, \nrespectively; χ2\n (1)= 68.36, p < 0.001).  \n \nTable 1 \n \nPresence (X) or A bsence (-) of 39 SH Behavioral Patterns, Based on Previously Published and Slightly Modified Classifications \n(cf.

Of the 75 stone handlers sampled in this species , including 11 \nadult males, 23 a dult females, 21 juvenile males, and 20 juvenile females , 58 individuals performed \npercussive SH patterns, including 10 adult males, 21 adult females 15 juvenile males, and 10 juvenile \nfemales. By contrast, of the 63 stone handlers sampled in M. fuscata, including eight adults males, 44 \nadult females, five juvenile males, and six juvenile females, only three individuals performed percussive \nSH patterns, including two adult females and one juvenile male. \n \nDiscussion \n \nThis paper provides the first SH ethogram  in Balinese long -tailed macaques. Categorizing \nbehavior by using descriptive observations is a first step towards understanding these motivations, as it \nprovides a thorough foundation on which to base future sequential and kinematic analyses. We used a \ntheoretical model (i.e., the behavior systems approach) to propose structural connections between SH, an \nobject play activity in this primate species, and more functional behavioral categories. By doing so, we \ninferred potential motivations for this playful and thus, incompletely functional behavior. Understanding \nthe motivations underlying object play behavioral patterns, specifically SH actions that are performed \nthroughout the lifespan, can offer insight into the fitness consequences of playful activities. Because SH is \nroutinely performed by both young individuals and adults, health -related and welfare benefits of this \nbehavior have been suggested (see Nahallage & Huffman, 2007a; Nahallage et al., 2016). \nOur preliminary behavior systems approach suggested that, while showing most characteristics of \nobject play, SH might be considered a foraging -like activity that consists of pseudo -foraging behavioral \npatterns directed toward non -edible objects. First, Balinese long -tailed macaques were as much \nmanipulative with stones as with food items that are difficult to process . Of the 36 SH patterns exhibited \nby Balinese long -tailed macaques (i.e., all those listed in Table 1, except Rub Together, and Toss And \nCatch), 34 have also been observed being performed in an e xtractive foraging context: nut handling, a \nfood-processing activity aimed at weakening the hard shell of three types of local fruits and nuts (i.e., \nCocos nucifera, Aleurites moluccanus and Pangium edule) in order to crack them open and feed on the \nseeds inside (Pelletier  et al. , 2017) . Second, we argued that a given SH pattern (i.e., Grasp) could be \nascribed to the most relevant perceptual-motor modules (i.e., collection/accumulation/hoarding), which in \nturn, could be included in the most putative motivat ional modes (i.e., food search) within a specific \nbehavior system (i.e., foraging). Third, SH could be viewed as the appetitive phase of the foraging \nbehavior system, with obviously no consummatory phase, because the object being manipulated (i.e., a \nstone) is not edible. Fourth, in free -ranging groups of Japanese macaques, most SH activity occurred \nwithin 20 min following food provisioning time and while the monkeys were still chewing their food \n(Leca et al., 2008 a). As such, our findings were consistent w ith the view that the structure of play \nbehavior is amenable to a behavior systems approach (Pellegrini, 2009; Pellis & Pellis, 2009). Object play \nbehavior has also been motivationally linked to foraging activities in other mammals (oriental small -\nclawed otters: Pellis, 1991; domestic cats: Hall & Bradshaw, 1998). \nOf course, the involvement of other behavior systems is also possible. For example, we argued \nthat the SH pattern “Throw” should primarily be ascribed to the foraging behavior system because it wa s \nreminiscent of the underhand throwing motion of a hard -shelled food item (e.g., coconut) up in the air to \ncrack it open, an innovative foraging technique observed in several macaque species (e.g., rhesus \nmacaques: Comins, Russ, Humbert, & Hauser, 2011; B alinese long -tailed macaques: Gunst, personal \nobservation). However, we acknowledge that a similar stone -directed upward throwing action could also \nfit into a defense behavior system (e.g., Japanese macaques: Leca, Nahallage, Gunst, & Huffman, 2008). \nStill, we believe that our study provides a basis for the “foraging substitute” hypothesis that should be \ntested using a principal component analysis. If the SH patterns assigned to particular modules (e.g., Pick \nUp, Gather, Grasp) frequently co -occur within a given SH bout, it could suggest that their expression is \nindeed underlain by a unique and so -called “collection, accumulation, hoarding” motivational module \nunder the “foraging behavior system” (Figure 4).  \n                                                                        Pelletier et al.   465 \n \nAlternative functional hypotheses pertaining to the expression of SH have been tested in Japanese \nmacaques, two of which received some support. In line with the “surplus energy” hypothesis, proposing \nthat play behavior enables the adaptive expenditure of excess metabolic energy, SH bouts in juveniles \n(often not limited in energy) were more frequent, versatile, and vigorous, but shorter, than in adults (Leca \net al., 2007). Consistent with the “motor training” hypothesis, SH could have beneficial consequences \nboth in immature individuals by allowing a faste r development of manipulative skills (Nahallage & \nHuffman, 2007a) and in senescent individuals by maintaining neural pathways through the daily practice \nof fined -tuned manual activity, and potentially slowing down the deterioration of sensorimotor and \ncognitive abilities associated with advanced age (Nahallage et al., 2016). Additionally, even though the \n“misdirected foraging” hypothesis was not supported in a captive group of Japanese macaques (Nahallage \n& Huffman, 2007a), it was supported in all free -ranging provisioned groups of this species, where there \nwas a clear temporal connection between SH occurrence and the post -provisioning period (Leca et al., \n2008a). Despite sometimes conflicting results, these alternative hypotheses are not mutually exclusive;  \nthey suggest that SH could be underlain by various motivational, cognitive, and maturational processes \ndepending on the age class and the context in which this activity occurs. Future experimentally controlled \nstudies should also examine whether the foraging behavior system approach to SH is causal in the context \nof free -ranging provisioned macaques. More specifically, individuals more frequently performing SH \npatterns that we ascribed to the food extraction module (i.e., “Clack,” “Flint,” “Pound”) should be more \nlikely to engage in experimentally -induced percussive stone tool use in a foraging context, due to their \nfamiliarity with stone-striking actions in a playful context. \nA previous study of SH in Japanese and rhesus macaques showed some similarities i n the SH \npatterns performed, suggesting a common behavioral propensity for SH in these two macaque species \n(Nahallage & Huffman, 2008). Our SH ethogram in long -tailed macaques provides the basis for a \ncomparison with a third species within the same genus. Table 1 showed only the presence or absence of \nSH patterns in these three species, and though this comparison should be viewed as preliminary, it is \nnoteworthy that the SH profile of Balinese long -tailed macaques overlapped more with that of Japanese \nmacaques than with that of rhesus macaques. Our results also showed that SH was significantly more \ndiverse in Balinese long-tailed macaques and Japanese macaques than in rhesus macaques.  With regards \nto percussive SH, we found that percussive SH patterns were m ore diverse in Balinese long -tailed \nmacaques than in Japanese and rhesus macaques.  Percussive SH activity was also more prevalent, more \nfrequent, and more enduring in Balinese long-tailed macaques than in Japanese macaques.  \nEven if our cross -species compa rison is preliminary, these differences suggest that long -tailed \nmacaques of all age and sex classes are more prone to use a variety of combinatorial and percussive \nactions during stone play activity than Japanese and rhesus macaques. Our results are consi stent with a \ncomparative analysis of object manipulation within the genus Macaca, and show that, among all four \nclosely related macaque species exhibiting SH (i.e., M. fascicularis , M. fuscata , M. mulatta , and M. \ncyclopis; cf. Nahallage et al., 2016), long -tailed macaques displayed the greatest variety of finger use \nmanipulation patterns (Torigoe, 1987). They are also consistent with a recent comparative analysis of \nmanipulation complexity across 36 nonhuman primate species, using a scaling method with incr easing \ncomplexity levels from 1 to 8, based on the (a)synchronous (un)coordinated use of hands and digits with \nsame/different objects; this study showed that Japanese macaques reached complexity level 6, whereas \nlong-tailed macaques reached level 7 (Heldstab et al., 2016).  \nInterestingly, these findings on the playful manipulation of stones in Balinese long -tailed \nmacaques parallel other stone-directed behavioral data collected in a more functional context in a closely \nrelated subspecies: Burmese long -tailed macaques are more frequent stone tool users than Japanese and \nrhesus macaques, and the only macaques spontaneously exhibiting percussive stone tool use techniques to \ncrack shellfish in coastal environments (Gumert et al., 2009; Tan, 2016). Developmental evidence \nindicates that percussive stone tool use in Burmese long -tailed macaques may be facilitated by a \nbiological predisposition to handle stones at a very young age, via exploratory and non -instrumental \nactions that are gradually incorporated into fora ging routines (Tan, 2017). From an evolutionary \nviewpoint, our study suggests that cross -species variation in manual dexterity and the behavioral \n                                                                        Pelletier et al.   466 \n \npropensity to manipulate stones  in a playful context could reflect, and possibly explain, differential \nadaptive foraging styles, including stone tool use, within the genus Macaca.  \nTo further explore the behavior systems pertaining to SH, one should test whether percussive SH \nand percussive stone tool use are underlain by similar motivational and cognitive process es. F uture \nanalyses will compare the kinematic structure of pounding actions with different objects in different \ncontexts, as well as the temporal organization of different types of pounding sequences, in Balinese and \nBurmese long-tailed macaques. After co ntrolling for age, and thus physical maturity, we expect higher \nstructural complexity of pounding actions and more predictable behavioral sequences as the apparent \nfunctionality of the activity, the food -related interest in the objects being handled, and t he difficulty to \nmanipulate them increase. More specifically, we predict that among adults, the variability in the execution \nof arm/hand movements and the level of randomness in the behavioral sequences will decrease from non -\npercussive SH (i.e., bouts inc luding stone -gathering and stone -rubbing) to percussive SH (i.e., bouts \nincluding stone-pounding on the ground) to percussive food handling (i.e., bouts including nut -pounding \non the ground) to stone tool use (i.e., bouts including stone -hammering on shell fish). This work could \noffer insights into the emergence of complex foraging activities such as percussive stone tool use in early \nhumans. \nLike other behavioral traditions (Fragaszy & Perry, 2003), SH is socially learned, performed by \nmost members of the g roup, transmitted over generations, and can be viewed as developing through \nnumerous phases (Huffman, 1984; Huffman & Quiatt, 1986; Huffman, 1996; Leca et al., 2012; Nahallage \n& Huffman, 2007b). The beginning phase can be described as the innovation phase,  where an individual \nperforms a novel activity. The second phase, transmission, is the early part of the behavioral diffusion, \nand can be described as the diffusion of SH behavior from individuals through social means, typically \nhorizontally among individu als in a close social network, such as playmates. In the later period of \ndiffusion, when the behavior reaches the tradition phase, SH is passed down through generations, \nprimarily from mothers to their offspring, and is performed by most members of the gro up (Huffman & \nHirata, 2003). An additional phase, the transformation phase, occurs after the behavior has reached a \ncultural level, and new patterns and modifications are added, leading to an increase in both repertoire size \nand complexity, and expanding the contexts in which they are performed (Huffman & Quiatt, 1986; Leca \net al., 2012). From this perspective, patterns such as “Slap -roll” and “Pound -drag” could be viewed as \npart of the transformation phase of SH, as they may involve the combination of alre ady established SH \npatterns to create new and more complex ones. Table 1 shows a total of eight new SH patterns identified \nin long-tailed macaques that have not been observed previously in other species. Patterns  such as “Slap-\nroll” and “Toss a nd Catch” we re idiosyncratic, being very rare and performed by only one to three \nindividuals, much like the “Flip,” “Swipe,” and “Spin” patterns in Japanese macaques, potentially \nspeaking to the novelty or complexity of the patterns.  \nThe transformation phase could al so involve the combination of already established SH patterns \nwith a variety of objects other than stones, body parts, and substrates. Patterns such as “Roll With \nFingers,” and different variants of “Throw” (i.e., “Throw and run,” “Throw and jump,” and “Th row and \nsway” performed in a group of Japanese macaques) are consistent with this view, as they involve \npreviously established patterns being performed in a new way. Stone throwing in Japanese macaques is a \nperfect example of this. When a “Throw” is perfor med in combination with an agonistic display, it \nprovides an effective signal to other individuals within the group, and can be considered a form of \nspontaneous tool use (Leca et al., 2008 b). The “Tap” pattern in long -tailed macaques could also be \nviewed as part of the Transformation phase of SH as it also encompasses several different variants. This \npattern can be performed using numerous body parts including tapping a stone onto the hands, feet, leg, \ntail, and groin, and often involves the combination wit h non -stone objects. Still, the primary focus on \nstones during the SH activity could be due to the fact that they are small, graspable, hard, sound -\nproducing, multifunctional, and ubiquitous objects. As such, our research has implications for the \nevolution of combinatory object-directed actions, including stone tool use, in our primate ancestors. \n \n \n                                                                        Pelletier et al.   467 \n \nConclusion \n \nThe lack of definitional and theoretical agreement regarding object play activities suggests that \nmore detailed descriptions are needed. We presented  the first SH ethogram in Balinese long -tailed \nmacaques. The behavior systems approach provides a likely hypothesis for future research on the \nunderlying motivations of SH. A systematic comparison of SH across multiple macaque species utilizing \nthis framew ork could enhance our understanding of the development and evolution of complex \nmanipulative activities in hominins, such as percussive stone tool use in a foraging context.  \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThis study was funded by the following agencies: Japanese Mini stry of Education, Science, \nSports and Culture, Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), HOPE Project, Natural Sciences \nand Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), Japan Society for the Promotion of Science \n(JSPS), L.S.B.

Though most frequently performed by bringing a stone up to the mouth, this pattern may also occur when \nan individual brings their face down to a stone that is placed on a surface, though not when embedded in a \nsubstrate.  \nCarry (CAR): To hold or cradle a stone while moving from one place to another.  \n \nComments: This pattern can be performed by using either the hands or mouth to grasp the stone. Stones are either \nheld or cuddled against the body while the individual moves in a bipedal, tripedal, or quadrupedal manner.  \nClack (CLK): To strike two stones, or a stone and an object, together with both hands moving in a symmetrical clapping gesture.  \n \nComments: This pattern is performed utilizing either a precision or power grip, and always occurring while the \nstones are being held in front of the individual, away from the ground and other body parts. \nCover (COV): To lightly place an object upon or over a stone with the hands.  \n \nComments: This pattern often resembles a peek-a-boo type of activity, where the stone is fully covered, and then \nfrequently uncovered. Items regularly used to perform this activity are leaves, plastic, cloth, or dried grass. This \npattern was not distinguished from “wrap” (WRP) in previous papers on Japanese macaques (Leca et al., 2007). \nCuddle (CUD): To grab a stone with the hand and hold it against a body part.  \n \nComments: Body parts frequently utilized in this activity include the chest, abdomen, groin, and side of leg. This \npattern can be performed with stones of various sizes, however frequently occurs with one large stone, or a series \nof smaller stones. Can be performed either on the ground, or away from the ground while held against the upper \nbody. \nDislodge (DSL): To (potentially attempt to) remove a stone embedded in a substrate by scratching or rubbing it with the \nfingertips or mouth.  \n \nComments: Stones are not always extracted from the substrate, however when they are, individuals either \nincorporate the newly unearthed stone(s) into the SH activities, or discard them immediately after dislodging. This \npattern is most frequently performed on a dirt surface. When using the mouth to dislodge a stone, the teeth are \nused in place of the fingertips, moving in a similar motion. \nFlint (FLN): To strike a stone held in one hand against another stone or object, that is held stationary in another body part.  \n \nComments: Though this pattern is performed most frequently with the hands, utilizing either a power of precision \ngrip, it is sometimes performed by using the mouth to hold the stationary stone (i.e., Flint in mouth). This pattern \nis always performed away from the ground.  \nGather (GAT): To bring a stone to oneself, often collecting stones into a pile in front of oneself.  \n \nComments:  This pattern can be performed in a number of different ways, including picking motions, gathering \nlarge amounts of stones by sliding them towards oneself on the ground using the arms to guide them towards \noneself, or the stacking of stones on top of one another. Stones can be gathered using both the hands and the feet.  \n                                                                        Pelletier et al.   470 \n \nGrasp (GRP): To clutch a stone placed in front of or beside oneself, on the ground.  \n \nComments: This pattern can be performed by both the hands or the feet, with a power grip, either tightly or \nloosely. This pattern frequently occurs while the individual’s attention is elsewhere, or while another SH pattern is \nbeing performed. \nGrasp-Walk (GRW): To clutch a stone in the palm of the hand while walking.  \n \nComments: This pattern can be performed by either the hands or the feet, however it is most frequently held in the \npalm of the hand while the individual moves in a quadrupedal manner.  \nGroom (GRM): To pick at or scratch a stone with the fingertips. \n \nComments: Stones may be held or grasped in the hand or foot, or placed on the ground. This pattern resembles \nwhat would be observed during allo- or self-grooming sessions, however the actions are directed towards stones \nrather than a monkey’s fur. \nHold (HLD): To pick up a stone and hold onto or clutch it for some time, keeping it away from both the body and other surfaces.  \n \nComments: This pattern can be performed by both the hands and the feet, most frequently utilizing a power grip. \nLick (LIC): To bring a stone to the mouth and touch it with the tongue.  \n \nComments: This pattern is typically performed using one or both hands, occasionally accompanied by foot \nsupport. This pattern is most frequently performed by bringing a stone to the face, rather than bringing the face \ndown towards a stone that is placed on a substrate.  \nMove And Push/Pull (MAP): To clutch a stone that is placed on the ground with the arm(s) extended in front of oneself, and walk \neither forward or backward while the stone is rubbed against the ground.  \n \nComments: This pattern can be performed using either one or both hands, and is sometimes performed in \ncombination with a “bite” (BIT).  \nMove Inside Mouth (MIM): To insert a stone inside the mouth and move it with the tongue or the hands.  \n \nComments: During this activity, the stone fully disappears inside the mouth. Stones can often be seen moving \nthrough cheek when performed.  \nPick And Drop (PAD): To repeatedly take a hold of a stone with the hands and let it fall to the ground or into a cavity.  \n \nComments: This pattern may be performed by picking up a stone and dropping it straight onto the ground, or the \nindividual may let the stone roll down a body part, such as the arms, when the stone is being dropped. When using \nsmaller stones, individuals frequently utilize a precision grip, and the action may resemble picking up small food \nitems and quickly discarding them. \nPick Up (PUP): To take hold of a stone with one hand and place it into the other hand.  \n \nComments: This action requires that the stone picked up be completely let go of by the original hand once placed \ninto the open supporting hand. This action is performed most frequently when hands are placed in front of the \nbody, away from any surface or other body parts. \nPound (PND): To strike a stone on the ground or an object, using a power grip.  \n \nComments: Stones are typically pounded on a hard surface such as concrete or packed dirt. Most frequently \nutilized target objects are leaves, cloth, nuts or other stones.  \n                                                                        Pelletier et al.   471 \n \nPound-Drag (PDR): To strike a stone on the ground using a fluid motion and instantaneously drag the stone backwards once \ncontact with the ground is made. \n \nComments: This pattern may resemble a “Pound” (PND) that is combined with a “Rub” (RUB), however, the \npattern is performed without interruption as one fluid motion, and the latter rubbing portion of the pattern is \ninterrupted as it does not include both a forward and backwards motion, only a backwards dragging motion of the \nhand. \nRoll (ROL): To move a stone back and forth on a substrate in a rolling or rubbing motion, performed with a loose grip or open \npalms.  \n \nComments: Though this pattern is most frequently performed with the hands, it is sometimes performed with the \nfeet. This pattern resembles “Rub” (RUB), however the hand grip utilized for this activity is different.  \nRoll In Hands (RIH): To roll or rotate a stone back and forth in both hands, moving in an alternating sliding gesture, with a loose \ngrip.  \n \nComments: Stones are typically rolled along the length of the hand, utilizing the palms and fingers of both hands. \nThis action can be performed either slowly or quickly. Stones are always held away from the ground or body when \nthis pattern is performed. \nRoll With Fingers (RWF): To move a stone back and forth on a substrate in a rolling motion using only the fingertips.  \n \nComments: This pattern differs from “roll” (ROL) as only the fingertips are used to perform this pattern rather \nthan utilizing the palm. A traditional grip is not utilized, rather the fingertips are pressed onto the stone with \nenough pressure as to guide the stone a short distance back and forth. This pattern is most frequently performed \ndirectly in front of the individual, using both hands to presumably stabilize and guide the stone. Stones used for \nthis activity are very round. \nRub (RUB): To slide or move a stone back and forth on a substrate utilizing a power or precision grip.  \n \nComments: Though this pattern may resemble “Roll” (ROL) the hand grip utilized in this activity is different. This \npattern can be performed on the ground, or other substrates, such as on the fur of the individual performing the \naction (i.e., rub on fur). When a stone is rubbed on the individual performing the action, the duration is typically \nvery short, and the stone is most frequently rubbed along the lower arms. Stones may also be used to groom other \nindividuals. When used to groom other individuals, this pattern differs from “Groom” (GRM), as the focus is to \nrub the stone along the fur of an individual, potentially using it to assist in the grooming process, rather than to \ngroom the stone itself. \nRub Together (RBT): To touch and move (in a rubbing motion) the surface of two stones together in an alternating sliding \ngesture.  \n \nComments: This pattern is always performed with the hands placed in front of the individual, away from the \nground and other body parts, utilizing either a power or precision grip. \nRub With Hands (RWH): To hold or grasp a stone with one hand (or foot) and move the palm of the other hand along the surface \nof the stone while applying firm pressure.  \n \nComments: The hand performing the rubbing motion can either move back and forth along the surface of the \nstone(s), or perform the rubbing action in only one direction multiple times. Though this pattern most frequently \noccurs when stones are being held away from the ground or body, or in the water, it can also be performed when a \nstone is being grasped on the ground.  \n                                                                        Pelletier et al.   472 \n \nScatter (SCA): To disperse a stone with the hands in a scattering motion on a substrate, in front of oneself.  \n \nComments: This pattern utilizes an open hand moving in a sweeping gesture across a substrate. This pattern differs \nfrom “gather” (GAT) as it does not bring stones towards the performer, rather moves them away, sweeping them \nto the side. \nShake In Hands (SIH): To move a stone in an open palmed hand by moving the hand back and forth, up and down, or repeatedly \nflexing fingers towards palm and back out again.  \n \nComments: The placement of the hand in this activity may sometimes resemble “cuddle” (CUD) as the back of the \nhand can be held against or close to the body when performed. This pattern is always performed while the hand is \naway from the ground. \nShift In Hands (SFH): To completely transfer a stone from one hand to the other repeatedly, utilizing a cupping motion of the \nhands. \n \nComments: The entire hand is utilized in this activity as the curving of the fingers allows for the cupping motion \nrequired to completely pass the stone(s) off into the other hand each time. This pattern can be performed either \nslowly or quickly. Stones are always held away from the ground or body when this pattern is performed. \nSlap (SLA): To hit a stone in a slapping motion with the palm or fingertips of the hand. \n \nComments: This pattern may resemble “tap” (TAP); however, it typically occurs one to few times, and is not used \nto hit or move a stone towards another stone, object, or body part. This pattern can be performed while a stone is \nbeing held, grasped, or on the ground, and can be performed with one or both hands.  \nSlap-Roll (SLR): To hit a stone in a slapping motion with the palm or fingertips of one hand, immediately followed by the \nrotation or rolling of the stone back and forth between both hands, moving in an alternating sliding gesture. \n \nComments: This pattern resembles a combination of two other SH patterns, namely a “slap” (SLA), followed by a \n“roll in hands” (RIH); however, it is performed only on the ground, rather than being held away from the ground \nor body while performing. This pattern is idiosyncratic, performed by only one individual. \nSniff (SNF): To bring a stone to the nose and smell it by inhaling.  \n \nComments: This pattern is most frequently performed by bringing a stone to the nose using the hands, however it \ncan also occur when an individual brings their face down to a stone that is placed on a substrate. The duration of \nthis pattern is typically very short, however longer durations are sometimes achieved by performing repeatedly.  \nTap (TAP): To move or tap a stone in a repeated sweeping gesture using the fingertips, against a substrate, object, or body part.  \n \nComments: This pattern may resemble “slap” (SLA); however, it occurs multiple times, and the stone is tapped \nagainst another object, stone, or body part. Body parts most frequently involved include the hands, feet, tail, groin, \nand legs. This pattern can be performed in combination with objects and body parts (i.e., to tap a stone against a \nstone that is held by the foot) or just involving a body part (i.e., to tap a stone against the genital region, onto the \nside of the leg, or onto the other hand).  \nToss And Catch (TAC): To lightly throw a stone upwards and catch it with one or both hands.  \n \nComments: This pattern is idiosyncratic, only performed by one individual.  \nToss-Walk (TSW): To lightly throw a stone, underhand, ahead of oneself while walking, then take hold of and clutch it in the \npalm of the hand.  \n \nComments: This pattern differs from “throw” as it is not performed stationary, but while the individual is walking \nin a quadrupedal manner. The distance travelled by the stone is generally much shorter than with the pattern \n“throw,” allowing the stone to be retrieved again after the tossing action occurs.  \n                                                                        Pelletier et al.   473 \n \nThrow (THR): To toss a stone underhand, either in front of or behind the individual. \n \nComments: This pattern differs from the locomotive pattern “toss-walk” (TSW) as the individual generally \nperforms this action while remaining stationary. Stones are thrown with the hands only, utilizing either one or both \nhands to perform the action.  \nWrap (WRP): To encase or enclose a stone in an object, using the hands, either tightly or loosely, in what appears to be an \nattempt to bend or fold the object around the stone.  \n \nComments: Items frequently used to wrap stones include leaves, cloth, plastic, and bundles of dried grass. This \naction can be performed either while the stone is placed on the ground, or while the stone is being held. The \nunwrapping of a stone that was previously wrapped with an object is also classified under this pattern. \n \nNote. “Object” refers to a variety of objects other than stones, including vegetal materials and man-made items (e.g., wooden \nstick, leaves, grass, nuts, cloth, nylon rope, plastic bag, metallic rod; Pelletier et al., 2016). \n \n \n \n ",
