INTRODUCTION \nARASITIC parameters in power electronics devices play an \nimportant role in device performance and efficiency. Many \napplications in power electronics use magnetic components. \nBecause of advantages such as compactness, active/reactive \npower fl ow control, and protect ion, [1, 2], HF galvanic \nisolation-based topologies have been widely incorporated in \npower electronics applications.  \n     The leakage inductance in transformers results from \nimperfect coupling between the primary and the secondary of \ntransformer windings w hich leads  to voltage  spikes, higher \nrectification losses, and efficiency reduction [3]. Additionally, \nparasitic capacitances lead to the injection of high frequency \ncurrents which increase the electromagnetic interferences \n(EMI). Moreover, parasitic capacitances may form electrostatic \ncoupling to other parts of the circuit. Decreasing these two \nparameters not only improve switching waveforms , but also \nimprove systems’ efficiency.  \nEstimating the value of these parasitic parameters , can be very \nhelpful during the design process. In some applications such as \nsoft-switching converters, it is possible to use parasitic \nparameters of transformers as the additional inductors needed \nto form LC tanks. In [4], using leakage inductance of  \n                                                             \n \ntransformer as the inductance  of tank circuit has reduced the \ntotal volume of the system by 15%. \n    As the frequency increases , the size of passive components , \ndecreases. Hence, increasing the frequency can help the \nminiaturization of the converter. However, at higher \nfrequencies, the importance of the parasitic, intensifies.  For \ninstance, the utilization of resonant soft-switching converters at \nhigher frequencies rely o n an accurate estimation of the \nparasitic in the final product. But unwanted leakage inductances \nand parasitic capacitances may interrupt resonant modes and \nproduce unwanted resonant frequencies , which can distort \nvoltage and current waveforms and decrease  the efficiency.  \nAlso, this may lead to the interruption in control system [5].  \n    In the design process of DC -DC converters, high frequency \ntransformer design is an important step. Depending on the \napplication and the design method, designers should decide to \nchoose a suitable core shape and winding formation to deal with \nthe parasitic parameters. Different transformer core shapes and \nwinding arrangements , lead to different parasitic parameters. \nTherefore, it is necessary to understand the parasitic behavior \nof various transformer cores and ways of reducing and changing \nthose parameters. \n    In this paper, six different transformer structures are \ninvestigated for high frequency and high power applications. \nThe transformers are 1:1 and working at 400V for both primary \nand secondary at 10 kHz for power rating of  8 kVA. The \nwindings are wound with AWG 8 (with diameter of 3.2639 \nmm) By using FEM magnetic field, electric field, and voltage \ndistributions are computed for each structure then leakage \ninductance and parasitic capacitance for each of them are \nobtained. Then, by using interleaved windings and changing the \nvoltage distribution along the cores , the parasitic parameters \nchanged and the results compared with previous computations.   \nII. TRANSFORMER DESIGN AND CORE SELECTION \n    Selecting magnetic material is a main step in designing hi gh \nfrequency transformers for power electronics applications. \nCost, size , and performance are three major factors , which \ndetermine type of magnetic material in each design. These \nfactors are influenced by relative permeability, temperature \nstability, core loss, cost, etc. Many magnetic materials can be \nused for the power electronics devices ; and designers need to \nmake a trade-off in choosing material s for each specific \napplication. In TABLE I five magnetic materials are compared. \nIt  is  noted  that  each  feature  is  totally  dependent  to  specific  \nAnalysis of Various Transformer Structures for \nHigh Frequency Isolation Applications \nMohamad Saleh Sanjarinia, Sepehr Saadatmand, Pourya Shamsi, and Mehdi Ferdowsi  \nDepartment of Electrical and Computer Engineering \nMissouri University of Science and Technology \nRolla, Missouri, USA \nCorresponding Author: Mohamad Saleh Sanjarinia (mswvq@mst.edu)  \nP \n \nTABLE I \nMagnetic Materials key features \n \nmanufacturer. In this table ferrites are soft iron and the others \nare powder materials. \n    For the high frequency transformer in this paper, iron powder \nis chosen , mainly due to the lower frequency of application. \nIron powder has a very low cost which make it suitable for mass \nproduction and shows very good temperature stability.

The turn ratio and cross sectional for all transformer \nstructures set on the same values in order to make a better \ncomparison, between the structures and transformers parasitic \nbehavior. \n𝑃𝑎𝑝𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 = 𝐾𝑓𝐾𝑢𝐵𝑚𝐽𝑓𝐴𝑝            (1) \nIn (1), 𝑃𝑎𝑝𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡, 𝐾𝑓, 𝐾𝑢, 𝐵𝑚, 𝐽, 𝑓, and 𝐴𝑝 are apparent power, \nwaveform coefficient, window utilization factor, flux density, \ncurrent density, and area product respectively.  \n    To find core loss density the Steinmetz equat ion is widely \nused.

TRANSFORMERS STRUCTURES \n    Toroidal, UU, and EE cores are widely used , in the power \nelectronics applications for the following reasons. The \ngeometry of toroidal cores forces the magnetic field lines to \nform in closed circular loops and constrain the magnetic flux \ninside the core and reduce  the EMI. Also, toroidal cores offer \nless weight and volume, and since they have a lower length of \ncopper, the winding resistance decreases and  due to large \nsurface area of these core heat removal via convection and \nradiation is better in comparison. But winding copper wires on \ntoroidal cores is more expensive than bobbin-based cores. Also, \nplacing airgaps on the toroidal cores is quite  difficult [7]. UU \ncores are also popular because of their simplicity , and high \nwindow utilization factor [7]. In some applications by using CC \ncores, which have rounded corners, high density of electric field \ncan be removed. Lastly, EE cores are widely used in the power \nelectronics applications.  If airgaps are needed, EE cores allow \nforgapping of only the center leg which will reduce the EMI and \nfringing issues that arise when all legs are gapped [ 7]. Cooling \nof EE and UU cores are easier than toroidal cores due to their \nstructure, which allows for a flow of coolant through the \nwindings if winding spacers are used. Since, the windings in the \nEE cores are not  completely covered by magnetic material, \nthere is more EMI in these cores , which renders them not \nsuitable for higher frequency applications. In such scenarios, \npot cores can replace EE cores.  \n    Fig. 2 shows the 3D transformer cores used for the \nsimulations to obtain the parasitic parameters in this paper. Fig. \n3 and TABLE III show the toroidal cores dimensions. Two \ntoroidal cores types are investigated in this paper with different \ndimensions.  \n    As it is shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b) both UU and EE cores are \nmade with eight block sets. Fig. 4 and TABLE IV represent the \nblock set and front and side views of the UU and EE cores. \nMoreover, in fig. 5 the winding arrangements used for the cores \nare depicted.

But for the toroidal core \nof Fig. 5(b) there is just one layer of 80 turns for the primary \nand the same for the secondary.

Furthermore, for the UU and the EE cores, 80 turns \nof the primary and the same turns of the secondary are wound \nin four layers for each of them. \nIV. PARASITIC PARAMETERS CALCULATIONS \n    In this section magnetic field, electric field, and voltage \ndistributions for all the transformer cores , depicted in the \nsection III, are displayed. Then, leakage inductance and \nparasitic capacitance for each structure calculated. Leakage \ninductance in transformers calculated by measuring energy and \nmagneto motive force (MMF) stored in the space , while the \nsecondary is short circuited and the parasitic capacitance \ncalculated is between primary and secondary winding.  \n    In high frequency, skin effect is the tendency of currents in \nconductors to concentrate on surface and by considering this \nphenomenon the leakage inductance values decrease. For \naccuracy purpose the skin effect is observed in the FEM \nsimulations. \nA. Magnetic Field Distribution and Leakage Inductance \nCalculations  \n    Fig. 6 shows magnetic flux density distributions , for all the \ncores. The flux density in this figure are obtained when the \ntransformers work at the full load. As it is clear in this figure, \nthe maximum flux density, in case 2 with 3 layers and case 2 \nwith 1 layer are slightly greater than case 1 of both of 3 and 1 \nlayers as well as flux density distribution linearity. In toroidal \ncores there is no saturation but in both UU and EE cores some \npoints are in saturation. The winding arrangements of the layers \nfor the EE core here, is the same as Fig. 5(d) with arrangement \nof P-P-P-P-S-S-S-S (P for primary and S for secondary) from \nleft to right in the right window and a symmetry arrangement \nfor the left window. \n         \n                      (a)                                                                 (b) \n  \n \n               \n                            (c)                                                                  (d) \n\n \n           \n                (e)                                                                      (f) \nFig. 6.

Hence, Leakage inductance i s \ndirectly proportional to the energy stored in the space and with \nequations (4) and (5) magnetic energy in the space is related to \nthe magnetic field strength (H).   \n \n𝑀𝑀𝐹 = ∮ 𝐻. 𝑑ℓ              (3) \n𝐸𝑚𝑎𝑔𝑛𝑒𝑡𝑖𝑐 𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦 =\n1\n2 ∰ 𝐻.

It is noted \nthat besides the cores , the relative permeability of other parts \nsuch as insulations, copper of windings, and air are considered \n1. But the topology and structures of the transformers influence \nthe leakage inductance values.

It is important to attention \nthat the dielectric constants and strength for these materials can \nvary, because of different manufacturers and this may change \nthe capacitance. According to the with IEEE Std. C57.12.01 \ndry-type transformers standard , which used in [ 8], the \ninsulation designs of this study transformers, should be based \non 10kV. To examine if the insulation materials and dimensions \nsatisfy the standard or not ; electric field distribution for the \ntransformers computed with FEM. In this distribution , the \nprimary is connected to the high insulation test voltage of 10kV \nand both secondary and cores are grounded. As it is shown in \nFig. 8 maximum electric field in insulations is much lower than \nthe dielectric strength of the used materials. \n    In order to find capacitance between windings by following \nprocedure used in [9], 1V applied to the primary windings and \n0V to the other ones.

Additionally, by substituting a \nconductive core (Iron Powder) with a nonconductive core \n(Ferrite-NiZn with 10 5(Ω. 𝑐𝑚) resistivity) the capacitacne can \ndramatically change for some cases.  \nC. Interleaved Windings  \n    By using interleaved windings , instead of the winding \narrangements explained in the previous part, leakage \ninductance significantly decrease. For the EE core here, using \ninterleaved windings reduce leakage energy stored in t he \nwindow area and decrease MMF. Thus, without changing \nmagnetizing inductance, leakage inductance decreases. As well, \nby using interleaved windings, parasitic capacitance changes \ntoo. Fig. 10 shows magnetic field strength distribution for three \n\n \ninterleaved winding arrangements (while the secondary is short \ncircuited) for the EE core.

However, \nmagnetic field, leakage stored energy in the window area and \nconsequently leakage inductance for this transformer decreases \nsignificantly by interleaved windings, the parasitic capacitance \nincreases significantly. Additionally, in TABLE VII type a and \nb have almost the same leakage inductance but a completely \ndifferent capacitance.  \nV. CONCLUSION \n    By comparing the results of the structures and the winding \narrangements, it can be concluded that by changing design \nparameters a wide range of leakage inductance and parasitic \ncapacitance can be obtained. Depend on the application and \nutilization, all of the studied structures can be used for the high \nfrequency transformers. To change the leakage inductance \nchanging the magnet ic field strength distribution is necessary \nbecause it leads to changing magnetic stored energy. By this \nmethod or using different structures, the leakage inductance for \nhigh frequency transformers can change and by reduction of \nthat, the efficiency can increase. But this may lead to a different \nparasitic capacitance between primary and secondary windings \nwhich in some applications with fast switches  (SiC and GaN)  \nwith high \n𝑑𝑉\n𝑑𝑡  result to injecting high frequency current that may \ncreate many troubles for the system. In some structures like EE \ncores using interleaved windings , may be a good solution to \nreduce leakage inductance, although this lead s to a higher \nparasitic capacitance. Final ly, to choose a structure and a \nspecific design strategy, each application and system should be \nconsidered and analyzed separately , and between leakage \ninductance and parasitic capacitance a trade -off is vital. Also, \nmanufacturing factors in each application are important and \nmay impose some design compromises.  \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \nThis material is based upon work supported by the U.S. \nDepartment of Energy, \"Enabling Extreme Fast Charging with \nEnergy Storage\", DE-EE0008449.  \nREFERENCES \n[1]   H.
