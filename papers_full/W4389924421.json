  "abstract": "The Open AI language model is a powerful tool for generating AI content. A Large amount of text data is trained through the language model, which can generate new text that is similar in style and tone to the training data. This language model can assist writers in generating high-quality content by offering suggestions and insights for improving language usage, sentence structure, and overall readability. This study represents the development of a content generation tool based on the open AI language model by utilising GPT 3 in the backend as an API to generate the necessary information for the model. With the help of this tool, businesses and individuals can produce high-quality, engaging content more efficiently than ever before. This content generation tool uses a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture, which enables it to make more accurate predictions than rule-based chatbots. All the features, like Facebook ads, LinkedIn posts, Amazon product descriptions, blogs, company bios, chat bots, and so on, will be presented in the dashboard. This tool is powered by advanced machine learning algorithms that can analyse and understand natural language, allowing them to produce content that is grammatically correct, free of errors, and tailored to specific audiences. They can also help optimize content for search engines, ensuring that it reaches a wider audience and generates more traffic with fine-tuning templates.",
