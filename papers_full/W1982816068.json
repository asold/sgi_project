    "abstract": "A novel zero‐voltage switching (ZVS) DC/DC converter with series connected transformers for high input voltage application is presented. Two series half‐bridge legs and two split capacitors are adopted in order to limit the voltage stress of active switches at V in /2. Two resonant converter modules are used to reduce current stress on active switches and rectifier diodes. Based on the series resonant tank, the active switches are turned on at ZVS and rectifier diodes are turned off at zero‐current switching. Thus, the switching loss of active switches and reverse recovery problem of rectifier diodes are reduced. The secondary windings are connected in series to ensure that the primary winding currents are balanced. Finally, experiments are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed converter.",
