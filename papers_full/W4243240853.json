Previous research suggests that these \njays can learn a preference toward functional tools – objects allowing them to obtain a food reward placed inside an \napparatus – according to their density (Cheke et al., 2011). However, it is not yet known whether they can also select \nfunctional tools (tool selectivity) according to other physical properties such as size and shape  and use different \nkinds of tools to solve a similar task. Here we conducted three object-dropping experiments aimed at exploring these \nabilities in Eurasian jays. In Experiment 1, jays tended to select large stones as tools irrespective of the diameter of \nthe apparatus. However, jays  progressively developed a preference for the small tool, which was functional with \nboth the wide and the narrow apparatuses. In Experiment 2, only vertically oriented long stones could fit into the \nnarrow apparatus, whereas both long and round stones were  functional with the wide apparatus. Jays showed a \npreference for the long stone and, with the narrow apparatus, tended to achieve the correct manipulation after one or \nmore unsuccessful attempts. In Experiment 3, jays were able to use sticks and adopt a n ovel technique on the same \nobject-dropping apparatus, thus providing the first evidence that Eurasian jays can use sticks as tools. Taken \ntogether, these results do not support the notion that tool selectivity abilities can be found in Eurasian jays but \nnonetheless show that these corvids can use different kinds of tools to solve similar tasks.  \n \nKeywords – Corvids, Eurasian jay, Physical cognition, Tool selectivity, Tool use, Stick tool \n \n Corvids are a family of large brained birds thought to possess remarkable cognitive abilities (Emery \n& Clayton, 2004). One iconic expression of this sophisticated cognition is their skill in solving physical \nproblems by using tools. The most prominent example is the New Caledonian crow ( Corvus \nmoneduloides), a species cons idered to be among the most proficient tool users in the animal kingdom. \nThese birds are, together with Hawaiian crows ( Corvus hawaiiensis), the only corvid species currently \nknown to develop tool use behaviors in the absence of training (Kenward et al., 2005; Klump et al., 2018; \nRutz et al., 2016) . Individual practice and social input, however, appear to be essential for juvenile New \nCaledonian crows to acquire some of the more complex tool behaviors habitually performed in the wild, \nsuch as the manufactur e of hooked stick tools or stepped pandanus tools (Holzhaider et al., 2010; \nKenward et al., 2006) . Growing evidence indicates that, although relying on an inborn predisposition for \nmanipulating objects (for a review see Amodio et al., 2018), tool use behaviors in New Caledonian crows \nmay entail complex physical cognition.  For instance, tool manufacture in these crows varies across \npopulations and represents an example of behavioral tradition (Hunt & Gray, 2003) that, according to a \nrecent study, may be sust ained through a mechanism of mental template matching (Jelbert et al., 2018) . \n                                                                        Amodio et al. 271 \n \nFurthermore, New Caledonian crows have been observed to build composite tools (von Bayern et al., \n2018), solve sequential tool use tasks (Taylor et al., 2007; Wimpenny et al., 20 09), and – when presented \nwith a multi-access apparatus – acquire food rewards by using up to four alternative strategies involving \ntwo different tools (i.e., sticks and balls , Auersperg et al., 2011) . It has also been reported that New \nCaledonian crows ca n select or manufacture tools of appropriate length to acquire out -of-reach baits \n(Chappell & Kacelnik, 2002; Hunt et al., 2006; Knaebe et al., 2017) , choose the most suitable raw \nmaterials (e.g., plant species) to shape hook tools (Klump et al., 2019), and distinguish between light and \nheavy objects by observing the movement of objects in the breeze (Jelbert et al., 2019).  \nIn some of these studies (e.g., Chappell & Kacelnik, 2002) , no evidence was found that crows \nlearned to select the functional tools over trials. This finding suggests that New Caledonian crows may be \ncapable of tool selectivity, here defined as: the ability to flexibly select tools that are functional to obtain a \nreward without having previously learned the contingencies between the phys ical properties of the tools \nand the associated outcomes on the specific apparatus. In other cases , however, it is problematic to take \ncrows’ performance as evidence that they can infer whether a tool is appropriate to solve a task by \nevaluating the physica l properties of the objects. For instance, Hunt et al. (2006)  found that New \nCaledonian crows could not craft tools of appropriate length before the first attempt at extraction. Most \noften, birds initially tended to carve out tools that were too short to a cquire the reward, and after one \nfailed attempt, they built a longer tool that could be used to solve the task. Because crows failed to \nimmediately craft tools that were functional, it cannot be excluded that they may have learned specific \ncontingencies to solve the task. \nCorvid species not known to habitually use tools in the wild also exhibit impressive skills in \nsolving problems by using tools. Possibly the most famous case is that of rooks (Corvus frugilegus). Bird \nand Emery (2009) conducted a series of o bject-dropping experiments demonstrating that these birds are \ncapable of tool selectivity on the basis of size and shape. Rooks were presented with a set of tools \ndiffering in one feature (e.g., size) and with an object-dropping apparatus, a transparent box with a baited, \ncollapsible platform in the inside and a vertical tube on the top. To solve the task, birds were required to \nselect a functional tool (i.e., an object that could fit into the tube) and to drop it into the vertical tube of \nthe apparatus, an  action that would collapse the internal platform thus releasing the food reward. In the \nsize selectivity test, rooks could choose between three stones of different sizes and they were tested in two \nconditions. In the first half of trials, stones of all si zes were functional (Wide tube condition), whereas, in \nthe second half of trials, only the small stones could fit into the apparatus (Narrow tube condition). Rooks \nwere reported to have immediately switched their preference for large stones in the Wide tub e condition \nto small stones in the Narrow tube condition. In the shape selectivity test, rooks were provided with two \nstones of different shapes and they were again tested in the Wide and Narrow tube conditions. Rooks \nselected and correctly oriented long s tones (over non -functional round stones) in the Narrow tube \ncondition, when only vertically oriented long stones were functional (Bird & Emery, 2009) . The authors \nfound no evidence that rooks’ preference toward tools of appropriate size and shape emerged t hrough \nlearning, such that birds may have adjusted their selection by inferring whether the tools were functional \non the basis of the physical properties of the objects. In a follow -up test, Bird and Emery (2009) showed \nthat rooks can acquire food rewards from the same apparatus by using sticks, i.e., tools that differed from \nthe ones they have been trained with, and that required a different technique. Rooks dropped heavy sticks \nin the same way they had previously dropped the stones, but they adopted a distinct technique to solve the \ntask with light sticks: they held the tool with their beak and pushed it downward to collapse the baited \nplatform. In a further set of experiments, Bird and Emery (2009) found that rooks are also capable of \nsolving a sequential tool use task, as well as fashioning functional tools by removing side branches from \ntwigs or shaping hook-like tools from straight wire. Common ravens ( Corvus corax) are another example \nof corvids that can use tools in captivity, although they do not hab itually exhibit such behaviors in the \nwild. Kabadayi and Osvath (2017)  recently reported that one raven successfully solved an object -\ndropping task on the first training trial, and subsequently employed an alternative tactic when stones were \nunavailable: t he bi rd filled the apparatus with parts of the aviary floor, and thereafter pecked at the \nsubstrate when it came within reach. Although anecdotal, this observation suggests that ravens, like New \n                                                                        Amodio et al. 272 \n \nCaledonian crows and rooks, may be capable of using different  kinds of tools and devising alternative \nstrategies to acquire food from the same apparatus.  \nThe flexibility in tool -use behaviors reported in these studies appears to indicate that complex \nphysical cognition may be widespread within the Corvus genus, a s ubgroup of corvids that includes \nrooks, common ravens, New Caledonian crows and Hawaiian crows. Why tool use in the wild is \nexhibited only by New Caledonian crows and Hawaiian crows may be explained by a number of factors, \nincluding stronger inborn predisp ositions for manipulating tools (Amodio et al., 2018; Kenward et al., \n2005, 2006), as well as idiosyncratic features of their habitats (e.g., reduced risk of predation, lack of \nextractive foraging competitors; Rutz & St Clair, 2012) . However, the Corvidae is a large family \nencompassing more than 100 species, arranged in 25 genera (Ericson et al., 2005) . Given that physical \nproblem solving has been studied predominantly in the Corvus genus, it is not clear whether the \nsophisticated physical cognition reported in this subgroup is shared with more distantly related species of \ncorvids. Gaining insight into this issue will have fundamental implications with regard to our \nunderstanding of the evolution of physical cognition in corvids.  \nTo date, it has been shown that Eurasian jays ( Garrulus glandarius) and California scrub -jays \n(Aphelocoma californica) can be trained to solve object -dropping tasks (Cheke et al., 2011; Logan et al., \n2016; Miller et al., 2016) . In the case of Eurasian jays, a member of the Garrulus genus, e mpirical \nevidence also suggests that these birds may take into account causal clues to solve tool use tasks. Cheke et \nal. (2011) presented Eurasian jays with a series of water displacement tasks that required the insertion of \ntools into an apparatus (i.e., a vertical tube filled with liquid) to acquire a reward, which could be reached \nonly after the liquid had been progressively raised as a result of the insertion of the tools. In the study, the \navailability of causal cues was manipulated, such that , in some tasks, jays could choose between an \napparatus or a tool that was functional according to physical principles and one that was not, whereas, in \nother tasks, jays had to select a functional apparatus according to arbitrary features such as color, i n the \nabsence of available causal cues or when the available causal cues were counter -intuitive. Cheke et al. \n(2011) found that when causal cues were available, jays could learn to choose a functional liquid -filled \napparatus over a non -liquid-filled appara tus c ontaining only air or filled with a solid substrate, and \nfunctional sinking tools over ones that float and therefore fail to raise the water level. When the functional \napparatus could be identified on the basis of arbitrary features rather than causal  cues, jays could also \nlearn to select the functional apparatus, but only in tasks in which the insertion of tools was ‘artificially’ \n(i.e., caused by the action of a hidden experimenter) associated with a progressive movement of the food \nreward. In contrast, jays failed to learn a preference toward the functional apparatus in a counter -intuitive \ntask. When presented with a modified apparatus formed by one baited narrow tube and two non -baited \nwide tubes with different color marks, jays could not learn to d rop tools into the functional non -baited \ntube, an action that would raise the level of the liquid not only in the functional non -baited tube, but also \nin the adjacent baited tube because these tubes were invisibly connected. Thus, the overall performance of \nEurasian jays in this study suggests that these corvids may have acquired tool use behaviors through an \ninterplay between instrumental learning and causal understanding, with the latter fostering/constraining \nthe learning process according to whether tas ks fit or do not fit with physical principles (Cheke et al., \n2011). \nIt is important to note that, in the Cheke at al. (2011) study, there are two confounding variables \nthat may have affected jays’ performance in the task requiring jays to select functional  sinking objects \nover non -functional floating objects. First, the two kinds of objects differed not only in density, the \nphysical property that determined its functionality, but also in material (rubber or foam). Second, both \nindividual birds that were tes ted had previous experience in dropping rubber tools, but not foam tools, to \nsolve water displacement tasks. Specifically, both birds had taken part in a previous water displacement \nexperiment that involved the use of rubber tools and stone tools. Note  however that their amount of \nexperience was quite different: one bird, Hoy, had used rubber tools on 35 occasions, whereas the other \nbird, Romero, had used rubber tools only once, and yet Hoy’s performance was no better than Romero’s. \nNonetheless, it cannot be excluded that jays developed a preference toward the functional rubber tool on \nthe basis of trivial features (e.g., material) or due to a higher familiarity with these objects. Furthermore, \n                                                                        Amodio et al. 273 \n \nbecause the Eurasian jays in Cheke at al. (2011)’s experimen t a ppeared to have learned over trials to \nselect the tools that were functional, it remains an open question whether these jays are capable of tool \nselectivity, as seems to be the case in other corvids, such as the rook and New Caledonian crow (Bird & \nEmery, 2009; Chappell & Kacelnik, 2002) . To overcome the potential confounds and limitations of \nCheke at al. ’s (2011) experiment, here we conducted two tool selectivity tests in which functional and \nnon-functional tools differed only in one feature (i.e., size i n Experiment 1, and shape in Experiment 2), \nand were not familiar to the birds in the context of object-dropping tasks. We presented the birds with two \nobject-dropping tasks that were designed after Bird and Emery’s (2009) size and shape selectivity tests,  \nand which involved an apparatus closely resembling that used in rooks. Finally, in a third experiment we \nexplored jays’ capability of using different tools – sticks – to acquire food for the same apparatus. \n \nMethod \n \nSubjects \n \nFive hand-raised Eurasian jays of both sexes were tested (females: Chinook, Jaylo, Stuka; males: \nHomer, Poe). At the time of testing (October -December 2016), all birds were juveniles (1.5 years). Birds \nwere group-housed in a large outdoor aviary (20x10x3m) at the Sub -Department of An imal Behaviour, \nUniversity of Cambridge. The birds received a maintenance diet of vegetables, eggs, seeds and fruits and \nwater ad libitum. All birds took part in Experiment 1a. Chinook stopped interacting with the apparatus \nand the tools after completing this experiment; therefore, she was excluded from subsequent experiments. \nAll birds except Chinook were tested in the subsequent Experiments 1b, 2 and 3. \n \nApparatus \n \nAll tests were conducted using an object -dropping apparatus originally designed by Bird and  \nEmery (2009) and modified for Eurasian jays by Cheke et al. (2011) and Miller et al. (2016). It consisted \nof a transparent Perspex box (12x11x11 cm) with a baited but out -of-reach, collapsible platform with a \nvertical tube (11.5 cm) on top (Figure 1). Depending on the experimental condition, either a wide tube (Ø \n4.2 cm) or a narrow tube (Ø 1.6 cm) was used. To release the food, birds could drop a tool (e.g., a stone) \ninto the tube, which then caused the internal platform to collapse and food to fall out. \n \nFigure 1 \nDesign and Apparatus Used in Experiment 1  \n \n \n \nNote. Left panel) Scheme showing the tools (stones or novel objects) and conditions (Wide tube, W; Narrow tube, N) used in \neach block (20 consecutive trials) in Experiment 1a  and 1b; Right panel) Pict ure of the Wide tube apparatus (back) and Narrow \ntube (front). \n \n \n                                                                        Amodio et al. 274 \n \nGeneral procedure \n \nBirds were tested in visual isolation from other individuals inside an indoor compartment (2x1x3 \nm). The experimenter placed the apparatus and the tools into the birds’ co mpartment through an opening \nin the mesh wall. In all three experiments, the tools were placed on one side of the apparatus, \napproximately 10 cm away from it. The initial position of the bird was not standardized, so that the bird \ncould be in any location within the compartment at the onset of each trial, i.e., when the stimuli were \npresented. In experiments involving multiple tools (Experiments 1 and 2), the tools were equidistant from \nthe bird when the bird was facing the front side of the apparatus (i.e., the side of the apparatus from which \nthe food is released). In Experiments 1 and 2, the position of the tools in regards to the apparatus (i.e., \nclose, middle, far position) was pseudo -randomized across trials such that a given tool was not presented \nin the same position (e.g., middle) on more than two consecutive trials. Live larvae of the mealworm \nbeetle (Tenebrio molitor) were used as food rewards. The baiting of the apparatus occurred out of view.  \nIn all experiments the maximum duration of a trial wa s set to 2 min. However, in Experiment 3, \none additional minute was allowed if the bird was interacting with the tool by the cut -off time. The \nadditional minute could be added up to two times, such that the maximum duration of a trial was 4 min. \nThis procedural detail was set during the very first trial, when it was noticed that the jay being tested \nrequired substantially more efforts to achieve the correct manipulation of stick tools. Typically, birds \nwere given one session of 10 trials per day. However, i f a  bird did not interact with the tool(s) at all \nduring a trial, testing was interrupted and continued on the next session, with the no-interaction trial being \nrepeated. For example, if a bird completed trials 1 -8 in session 1 and subsequently it stopped interacting \nwith the stimuli on trial 9, then on the next session the bird received trial 9 again, and potentially 10 \nadditional trials, namely trial 10 (from session 1) and trials 11 -19 from session 2. Birds did not receive \nmore than 11 trials per session . F or the above example, this means that trial 20 from session 2 was \npresented on the subsequent session, together with trials 21-29 from session 3 and so on. Subjects did not \nhave access to their maintenance diet for 1  hr prior to testing to ensure that t hey were motivated to eat \nmultiple food rewards during testing. Water was accessible ad libitum  during testing. All experiments \nwere recorded using a GoPro® Hero 4 video-camera and subsequently analyzed.  \n \nSpecific Procedure and Materials \n \nRefresh Training \n \nAll birds had previously been trained to drop hollow metal balls (Ø 2 cm, 4 g) inside the \napparatus as part of a previous study (Miller et al., 2016) . All birds had also been further exposed to the \nwide tube apparatus and metal balls in a non -systematic manner. This occurred during January -April \n2016, as part of the training of one of us (PA) in working with the jays. Critically, h owever, the birds had \nno prior experience of dropping any of the specific tools used in this study (stones and sticks). We \nconducted a short refresher training to ensure that the birds were still familiar with the task and would \ninsert stones into the apparatus. During training, the birds were presented with the wide tube apparatus \nand a single tool placed approximately 10 cm away from it. In the first five trials, they were provided with \nthe metal ball (i.e., the tool with which they had previously been trained) and in the following five trials \nwith a medium stone (4.2 ± 0.5 g). All birds successfully solved these 10 trials before testing started. \n \nExperiment 1: Size Selectivity Test \n \nThe design of this experiment closely followed the ‘Stone Size Test’ conducted by Bird and \nEmery (2009) on rooks. We used both the wide and the narrow tube apparatuses in the test. In Experiment \n1a, stones of three sizes – large (7.8 ± 0.2 g), medium (4.2 ± 0.5 g), small (2.2 ± 0.1 g) – were provided as \ntools. With the wide tube, stones of all sizes were functional (i.e., all stones could fit inside the tube), \nwhereas with the narrow tube, only the sm all stone was functional because the two larger stones did not \n                                                                        Amodio et al. 275 \n \nfit inside the tube. The experiment w as composed of four blocks (Figure 1). In Block 1 (trials 1 -20), jays \nwere presented only with the wide tube apparatus to evaluate their potential preference for a specific tool, \nnamely the small versus the large stone. In Block 2 (trials 21 -40), both the narrow tube (10 trials in total) \nand the wide tube (10 trials in total) were used to investigate whether the jays would spontaneously select \nthe small stone when this was the only functional tool (Narrow tube condition), and if they would express \nthe same preference when all stones were functional (Wide tube condition). The two apparatuses were \npresented in a pseudo-randomized order such that the jays were no t presented with the same type of tube \non more than three consecutive trials. In Block 3 (trials 41 -60), only the narrow tube apparatus was used. \nThis block was designed to facilitate jays’ learning about the functional features of the small stone. \nFinally, i n Block 4 (trials 61 -80), birds received a further test with the narrow and wide tubes that \nfollowed the procedure of Block 2. This experiment differed from the ‘Stone Selectivity Test’ conducted \nby Bird and Emery (2009) in two respects. Rooks tested in  the latter study received a smaller number of \ntrials (i.e., 60 trials), and they experienced only the wide tube apparatus in the first 30 trials and only the \nnarrow tube apparatus in the remaining 30 trials. \nAfter noting that the jays appeared to have swi tched to using the small stone more often in Block \n4 than in Block 2, in Experiment 1b, we investigated whether jays may have learned to select the small \nstone based on its functional property, namely its size. To that end, Experiment 1b was a transfer tas k \nwith novel objects, which differed from the stones in irrelevant perceptual properties namely color, shape \nand material. In the same way that the stones previously differed in their functional property of size, the \nnovel objects were large (15 g), medium  (10.5 g) and small (5 g) bolts upholstered with red tape. Like \npreviously, the novel objects of all sizes were functional with the wide tube but only the small one could \nfit into the narrow tube. Given that jays had had two blocks of the two apparatuses in a counterbalanced \norder in Experiment 1a, they also received two blocks in Experiment 1b (Figure 1):  Block 5 (trials 81 -\n100) and Block 6 (trials 101-120). In each block, there were 10 trials with the narrow tube in total and 10 \ntrials with the wide tube, the order of which was pseudo-randomized such that the jays were not presented \nwith the same type of tube on more than three consecutive trials.  \n \nExperiment 2: Shape Selectivity Test \n \nThe design of this experiment closely followed the ‘Stone Orientation Test’ used by Bird and \nEmery (2009) for rooks. In Experiment 2, jays were provided with two shapes of stone tools: long stones \n(approximately 2.4x1.0 cm) and round stones (approximately 1.8x1.9 cm). Birds received a total of 20 \ntrials, 10 of which were wit h the narrow tube and 10 of which were with the wide tube. The order in \nwhich birds were presented with the narrow and wide tubes was pseudo -randomized such that the jays \nwere not presented with the same type of tube on more than three consecutive trials. To successfully solve \nthe task in the Narrow tube condition, birds had to select the long stone and orient it vertically to insert it \ninto the tube. In the wide tube condition, both stones were functional and no specific rotation of the tool \nwas required. This experiment and the equivalent test previously conducted on rooks (Bird & Emery, \n2009) differed in the number of trials (40 trials in rooks) and in the fact that the two apparatuses were not \ncounterbalanced within sessions of trials: rooks first receiv ed 20 trials with the wide tube apparatus, and \nsubsequently 20 trials with the narrow tube apparatus. \n \nExperiment 3: Stick Tool Test \n \nThe design of this experiment closely matched the ‘Stick Use Test’ conducted by Bird and Emery \n(2009). In Experiment 3, jays were provided with one of two types of sticks as a tool: a twig (11 cm long, \n3.0 g) or a wooden skewer (11 cm long, 0.4 g). When provided with the twig, jays could solve the task by \ndropping it, just like they previously did with stones ( No Push technique). Due to its lighter weight, the \nwooden skewer required jays to hold it in their beak and push it downwards to collapse the baited \nplatform (Push technique). A total of 10 trials with the wide tube were conducted. On each trial, jays were \nprovided with only one type of tool (the wooden skewer or the twig), the order of which was pseudo -\n                                                                        Amodio et al. 276 \n \nrandomized such that jays did not receive the same tool on more than two consecutive trials. In contrast to \nthis experiment, rooks tested by Bird and Emery (2009) received  more trials (20 trials) and they were \npresented consistently with the heavy stick in the first 10 trials, and then the light sticks in the final 10 \ntrials. \n \nData Analysis \n \nAll data were analyzed with R.3.5. using the RStudio 1.1.447 wrapper (RStudio Team, 2018). In \nExperiment 1, we scored the tool (small, medium or large) selected on each trial. Ordinal -logit models \n(package ordinal, Haubo & Christensen, 2018) were used to test whether jays adjusted their preference of \nselection i) according to the condition (Wide or Narrow tube), and ii) across blocks (e.g., due to learning). \nIn all models, the size of the tool (small, medium or large) selected in each trial was treated as ordinal \ndata and fitted as a response variable. In Experiment 2, we scored the tool (long or round stone) selected \non each trial. Additionally, we scored what kind of manipulation of the long stone was performed on each \ntrial. Specifically, three kinds of manipulation could be achieved. The long stone could: i) be oriented \nvertically prior to the first insertion attempt ( Immediate Rotation); ii) be oriented vertically after one or \nmore failed insertion attempts ( Eventual Rotation), or; iii) not be oriented vertically ( No Rotation). The \nscoring of these behaviors had been planned before the  experiment was conducted, based on the results \npreviously reported in rooks on this test (Bird & Emery, 2009). Before conducting the experiment, we had \nplanned to analyze the kind of rotation of the long stone as a three outcomes variable, i.e. Immediate \nRotation – Eventual Rotation – No Rotation . However, two out of four individuals performed only \nImmediate Rotation or Eventual Rotation, such that we decided to i) collapse the variable into a binary \none by merging Immediate Rotation and Eventual Rotation into a single outcome ( Rotation), and; ii) \nreport a descriptive analysis with regard to the two particular kinds of rotation that were observed. \nBinomial GLMM (package lme4, Bates et al., 2015)  and GLM (package stats, R Core Team and \ncontributors worldwide , 2 018) were used to test whether the kind of tool selected and the kind of \nmanipulation of the long tool – analyzed as Rotation vs No Rotation – varied i) according to the condition \nand, ii) across blocks (e.g., due to learning). Models were calculated at  maximum complexity but in case \nof overfitting we reduced the model by dropping the least important single terms. In Experiment 3, we \nscored: i) whether a trial was successful, ii) the technique utilized to solve the task with stick tools (i.e., \nPush technique, No Push technique), and iii) the number of insertion attempts until successfully inserting \nthe tool into the apparatus. The scoring of successful trials and the tool use technique had been planned \nbefore the experiment was conducted, based on the res ults previously reported in rooks on this test (Bird \n& Emery, 2009) . We decided to score the number of insertion attempts during the testing phase as it \nbecame clear that this variable was very informative  of inter-individual differences in performances. T he \ndata were analyzed descriptively. \nAll datasets and R scripts used to conduct the statistical analyses are available at \nhttps://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3669859. In addition, a previous version of the  statistical analyses can be \nfound at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3471706. The only difference between the two analyses is that, in \nthe final version, we have included the bird identity as a random  effect in Models 1 -3 and 5. This was \ndone during the revision of the manuscript, in response to a comment made by a reviewer. \n \nResults \n \nInter-observer Reliability \n \nPA coded all videos and Benjamin Farrar (BF) acted as a naïve coder, analyzing 20% of video s \nfor each experiment. Inter -observer reliability was excellent: for Experiment 1 (size of selected tools: \nCohen’s kappa k = .986, p < .0001) and Experiment 2 (shape of selected tools: Cohen’s kappa k = 1, p < \n.0001; kind of rotation of the tool: Cohen’s k appa k = 1, p <.0001), and for Experiment 3, PA and BF \nachieved 100% of agreement in scoring successful trials and insertion techniques. \n                                                                        Amodio et al. 277 \n \nExperiment 1: Size Selectivity Test \n \nIn Block 1, one bird (Stuka) received 15 instead of 20 trials due to an experimental error. Overall, \nthe proportion of trials on which jays selected each type of stone did not differ across the conditions \n(Model 1, Table 1, see also Figure 2);  for example the proportions of trials on which jays selected the \nsmall stone appeared to be s imilar when presented with the narrow tube apparatus and when presented \nwith the wide tube apparatus. Hence jays did not adjust the selection of tools according to the diameter of \nthe tube. We further tested whether the proportion of selection of the three  stones varied across blocks by \ncomparing jays’ performance in Block 1 with each of the three subsequent blocks. The performance in \nBlock 1 represents the spontaneous preference exhibited by the jays when all tools were functional; \ntherefore, this block wa s considered as a meaningful reference to analyze changes of preference through \ndyadic comparisons among blocks. Model 1 (Table  1) showed that the proportions of selection of the \nthree stones in Block 1 were comparable to those observed in the two subsequent blocks, but significantly \ndifferent from the proportions of selection in Block 4. This result is likely to be explained by the variation \nin preference for the large and the small stones throughout blocks (Figure 3). A stronger preference \ntowards the lar ge stone appeared in Block 1 and was retained across Block 2 and 3, but it became less \npronounced together with an increase in preference for the small stone in Block 4 (Figure 3). To \ninvestigate whether the slight shift in the jays’ preference for the sma ll tool may have been due to its \nfunctional feature represented by size, we compared the jays’ performance in the last block when tools \nwere stones (Experiment 1a; Block 4) with the first block when tools were novel objects (Experiment 1b: \nBlock 5). One su bject (Chinook) was excluded from this analysis because she did not participate in \nExperiment 1b. Consistent with the previous analysis, jays’ performance was comparable across \nconditions (Model 2, Table 1). Model 2 also indicated that the proportions of s election of the three stones \nin Block 4 were similar to the proportions of selection of the three novel objects in Block 5 (Table 1; \nFigure 3). This means that jays showed a similar pattern of behaviors with the stones and the novel \nobjects. Together , thes e r esults are consistent with the possibility that jays transferred their pattern of \npreference between tools of different appearances. However, because we did not test jays’ preference for \nthe three novel objects in a naïve group of birds, we cannot rule out the possibility that jays’ performance \nin Block 5 resulted from a difference in preference for the novel objects over stones that was not \ninfluenced by their experience in Experiment 1a.  \n \nTable 1 \n \nResults from Ordinal-logit Models Examining Whether th e Proportions of Selection of the Three Tools Differed: i) According to \nthe Condition (Wide or Narrow tube) and ii) Across Blocks of Trials \nModel Variable Estimate SE z p   \n1 \nNarrow Tube - Wide Tube  -0.14 0.27 -0.52 .60   \nBlock 1 - Block 2 0.30 0.31 0.94 .35   \nBlock 1 - Block 3 -0.04 0.39 -0.09 .92   \nBlock 1 - Block 4 -0.74 0.31 -2.37 .02 * \n2 Narrow Tube - Wide Tube  -0.37 0.33 -1.13 .26   \nBlock 4 (Exp. 1a) - Block 5 (Exp. 1b) -0.20 0.33 -0.61 .54   \n3 Narrow Tube - Wide Tube  -0.60 0.32 -1.83 .07   \nBlock 5 - Block 6 -0.72 0.33 -2.20 .03 * \nNote.

In trials with the narrow tube apparatus (blue dots), only the small tool was functional, whereas in trials with the wide tube \napparatus (yellow dots), all tools (i.e., small, medium and large tool) were functional.  \n \n \nFinally, we compared jays’ preference of selection of the three novel objects between the two \nblocks of Experiment 1b. Model 3 (Table 1) revealed that the proportions of selection of the three tools in \nBlock 5 and Block 6 were significantly different. This result could be explained by the concurrent \nstronger preference for the small tool and decreased preference for the large tool in Block 6 (Figure 3). \nThis pattern first appeared in Block 4, was then retained in Block 5, and finally increased in Block 6 \n(Figure 3). Supporting previous findings, Model 3 also  indicated that jays’ performance was again \nconsistent between conditions. \n \n \n \n \n                                                                        Amodio et al. 279 \n \nFigure 3 \n \nBox and Whisker Plot Showing the Proportions of Selection of the Small, Medium and Large Tool in Experiment 1a (Block 1 -4) \nand Experiment 1b (Block 5,6)  \n \n \nNote. In Block 1, all stones were functional because the wide tube apparatus was used in all trials. In Block 3, only the small \nstone was functional because the narrow tube apparatus was used in all trials. In each of the remaining blocks (i.e., Blocks 2, 4, 5, \nand 6), half of trials were conducted with the wide tube apparatus and the other half of trials were conducted with the narrow tube \napparatus. In the plot, the two conditions (Narrow and Wide tube) are grouped for Blocks 2, 4, 5, and 6, as jays’ performance was \ncomparable across conditions (Model 1, Table 1). \n \n \nExperiment 2: Shape Selectivity Test \n \nWhen pres ented with a choice of two stones of different shapes, jays showed a pronounced \npreference for the long stone in both conditions (Narrow tube: 77.5 ± 7.5% trials; Wide tube: 77.5 ± 4.8% \ntrials; Mean ± SE). The GLM analysis indicated that jays’ preference f or the long stone was stable across \nconditions and blocks (Model 4, Table 2). \nIn line with previous findings in rooks (Bird & Emery, 2009) , the jays performed three kinds of \nmanipulation when the Long stone was selected. The tool was oriented vertically (Figure 4) either prior to \nthe first insertion attempt ( Immediate Rotation ) or after one or more unsuccessful attempts ( Eventual \nRotation). Alternatively, the tool was oriented horizontally with respect to the tube ( No Rotation, Figure \n4). However, not all individuals performed the three kinds of manipulation of the long stone. In particular, \nHomer never performed Eventual Rotation, whereas Poe never performed Immediate Rotation (Figure 5). \nTo investigate whether the manipulation of the long stone differed between conditions we fitted a GLMM \nwith a binary outcome variable ( No Rotation -Rotation). The manipulation of the long stone differed \nbetween the conditions (Model 5, Table 2) with higher frequencies of rotation performed with the Narrow \ntube (Narrow tube: 79.1 ± 10.1% trials; Mean ± SE). However, the correct orientation of the long stone in \n                                                                        Amodio et al. 280 \n \nthe Narrow tube condition was often achieved after one or more incorrect attempts of insertion ( Eventual \nRotation: 55.3 ± 21.1% of trials with the narrow tube in which the long stone was rotated; Figure 5). \nTherefore, this finding cannot be taken as evidence that jays had a solid understanding of the affordance \nof the task, because, in this case, they would have correctly oriented the stone before the first insertion \nattempt (Immediate Rotation). Model 5 (Table 2) also  indicated that the manipulation of the long stone \nwas stable across blocks.  \n \nTable 2 \n \nResults from GLM (Model 4) and GLMM (Model 5) Examining Data of Experiment 2  \nModel Variable Estimate SE z p   \n4 \nIntercept -1.38 0.47 -2.94 .003 ** \nNarrow Tube - Wide Tube  -0.01 0.54 -0.03 .98   \nBlock 1 - Block 2 0.29 0.54 0.53 .60   \n5 \nIntercept 1.89 0.97 1.94 .053   \nNarrow Tube - Wide Tube  -2.84 0.79 -3.61 .0003 *** \nBlock 1 - Block 2 0.006 0.70 0.009 .99   \n \nNote.

However, the insertion rate was \nextremely variable: Homer 9/10 trials, Jaylo 8/10 trials, Poe 2/10 trials, Stuka 1/10 trials. Similarly, t he \nnumber of insertion attempts was also quite variable among subjects (Table 3). The success rate matched \nthe insertion rate for all subjects except for Jaylo, who did not collapse the platform in three trials in \nwhich the tool was inserted into the appar atus. In most of the successful trials (77%), jays collapsed the \nplatform of the apparatus by actively pushing downward on the stick (Push technique). The technique was \nadopted not only with light wooden skewers but also with twigs. In 23% of successful tr ials, the insertion \nof the twig into the apparatus was sufficient to collapse the platform in the absence of active pushing ( No \nPush Technique). The reason for the active pushing with the heavy stick can likely be explained by the \ninsertion technique used by the birds. Instead of dropping the stick as they did with stones, birds typically \nheld the stick near one end and appeared to carefully steer it inside the tube (Figure 4). As a result of these \nseemingly gentle movements, the heavy stick likely did not always hit the platform with enough force to \ncollapse it. All birds used the Push technique at least once. Two subjects (Homer and Poe) solved the task \nby using both techniques. \n                                                                        Amodio et al. 281 \n \nFigure 4 \n \nEurasian Jay Being Tested in Experiment 2 and Experiment 3  \n \nNote.

Jays showed no evidence of tool selectivit y, i.e., they \ncould not immediately adjust their choice according to the functionality of the tools  but were capable of \nusing sticks as tools. In the size selectivity test (Experiment 1), jays initially exhibited a preference for the \nlarge stone regardles s of whether this tool was functional . Thus, jays seem to have failed to encode the \nrelevant feature of objects and to adjust their selection of a tool according to the features of the apparatus. \nHowever, jays’ performance also suggests that they ma y be capable of altering their selection of tools \nthrough learning; across trials, jays reduced their initial preference in favor of the only tool that was \nfunctional in both conditions, namely the small stone. Subsequently, when presented with novel objec ts \n(Experiment 1b), jays initially expressed a pattern of selection that was comparable to that observed \ntoward stones in the final block of the previous test (Experiment 1a), but subsequently further increased \n                                                                        Amodio et al. 284 \n \ntheir preference for the small tool. This res ult is consistent with the possibility that jays transferred their \npreference of which tool to use based on size despite other perceptual differences between the objects \n(perhaps through a process of generalization, cf. Shettleworth, 2010) . In the shape se lectivity te st \n(Experiment 2) , jays exhibited a pronounced preference for the functional tool (long stone) in both \nconditions, but they tended to perform the correct manipulation of the tool only when needed (Narrow \ntube condition). However, the descriptive  analysis s howed that jays often achieved the correct \nmanipulation of the tool after one or more failed attempts of insertion ( Eventual Rotation) rather than \nbefore the first insertion attempt ( Immediate Rotation). Therefore, it is likely that jays correct ly oriented \nthe tools through trial -and-error, in the lack of a full understanding of the objects’ properties and \nfunctionality. In the stick tool test (Experiment 3), all birds were capable of using a novel tool and of \nacquiring food rewards from a famili ar apparatus through a novel strategy (i.e., Push technique). These \nresults also represent the first demonstration that Eurasian jays can use sticks as tools. \nThe overall pattern of our results supports previous reports of learning forming the basis of \nEurasian jay t ool use (Cheke et al. , 2011). The relatively fast learning of a preference for the functional \ntools in the latter study may have been facilitated by the fact that birds had already experienced the \nfunctional sinking objects as tools  before the study (Cheke et al., 2011) and that the functional and non -\nfunctional tools differed not only in the relevant characteristic (density) but also in another feature \n(material). Further, in line with Cheke et al. (2011), we found important individual differences in tool use \nskills in Eurasian jays. One bird, Homer, rapidly developed a clear preference for the functional small tool \nin Experiment 1 (Figure 2) compared with the other jays that were tested; Homer more frequently \noriented the tool correctly before the first insertion attempt (Immediate Rotation) in Experiment 2 (Figure \n5) and solved more trials (9/10) and by using both techniques in Experiment 3 (Table 3). A possible \nexplanation for the performance of this individual  may be linked to his experimenta l history. Homer was \nused as the demonstrator in a previous tool use study (Miller et al., 2016)  and thus has received a more \nextensive exposure to the object-dropping apparatus than the other individuals we tested. \nGiven that neither Eurasian jays nor roo ks habitually use tools in the wild, it is interesting to \ncompare the performance of the jays in this study with that of the rooks tested by Bird and Emery (2009). \nImportantly, however, one must exhibit caution in doing so given that these were two separat e \nexperiments, but tentative comparisons might yield fruit for further work in which the two groups of birds \ncould be directly compared. When tested in a similar size selectivity test, rooks immediately switched \ntheir preference from the large stone to the  small stone when the latter was the only functional tool (Bird \n& Emery, 2009) . In the shape selectivity test, rooks, like jays in this study, expressed a pronounced \npreference for the long stone regardless of the condition, and higher frequencies of rotation in presence of \nthe narrow tube (Bird & Emery, 2009) . Crucially however, rooks often performed Immediate Rotation \nrather than Eventual Rotation in the Narrow tube condition. Taken together, the performances of these \nspecies may indicate that Eurasian jays may have more limited tool selectivity abilities than rooks (Bird & \nEmery, 2009). However, this possibility should be considered with caution given the methodological and \nontogenetic differences between our experiments and those conducted by Bird and Em ery (2009). \nSpecifically, in Bird and Emery’s (2009) selectivity tests, rooks were systematically presented with the \nwide tube apparatus in the first half of trials, and subsequently with the narrow tube apparatus in the \nremaining trials. In contrast, the jays tested in this study did not experience such a clear sequence of \nexposure to the two apparatuses, as the presentation of the two apparatuses most often co -occurred within \nthe same block of trials. Although apparently minor, it cannot be excluded that this methodo logical \ndifference may have influenced the performances of the two species.  \nAnother potentially relevant difference between the studies is that jays tested in this study were \njuveniles (1.5 years old at test date) whereas the rooks tested by Bird and Emery (2009) were adults at the \ntime of testing. Thus, it cannot be excluded that developmental differences or limited experience in \nmanipulating objects may have influenced the comparison between the species. Note that the good \nperformance of juvenile New Caledonian crows in tool use tasks (Jelbert et al., 2014; Logan et al., 2014)  \nmay not be very indicative here, because this species exhibits a strong inclination to manipulate tools as \nearly in development as a few weeks post -fledging (Kenward et al., 2005) , which is absent in other \n                                                                        Amodio et al. 285 \n \nspecies of corvids that do not habitually use tools in the wild. Only future research, however, will allow \nus to reach firmer conclusions regarding the role played by ontogeny and previous experience in the \nacquisition of tool use proficiency among species of corvids that do not use tools in the wilds by \nsystematically testing the influence of these factors in a direct comparison between different species.  \nIn regard to the stick tool test, jays’ performance appears to b e similar to that reported in rooks \n(Bird & Emery, 2009) . Both species appear to exhibit good levels of flexibility in using novel tools to \nsolve a familiar task. Supporting previous findings in rooks (Bird & Emery, 2009) , jays’ use of sticks as \ntools also indicate that New Caledonian crow -like adaptations in beak morphology and vision (Martinho \net al., 2014; Matsui et al., 2016; Troscianko et al., 2012)  are not essential to achieve basic manipulations \nof stick tools. Ultimately, to directly assess the ques tion of whet her the sophisticated physical cognition \nreported in the Corvus genus is shared with more distantly related species of corvids, future work will \nhave to encompass large -scale comparative studies, where different species can be directly compared  \nusing the same or equivalent methodology.  \nIn summary, after being trained to use stones as tools, the Eurasian jays were able to generalize to \nusing sticks and to adopt a novel technique on the same apparatus, i.e., collapsing the internal platform by \nactively pushing a tool against it. What appears to be in contrast to the previously reported results for \nrooks and New Caledonian crows is that the Eurasian jays failed to immediately adjust their selection of \ntools according to their functionality. How ever, the jays’ performance indicates that these birds were \ncapable of learning to optimize their behavior, as they progressively developed a preference for the \nsmaller size tool, which was the only tool that was functional in both conditions, and performe d t he \nrequired manipulation of the functional long-shaped tool. \n \nAuthors’ Contribution \n \nSJ and PA designed the study with the help of NSC.
