  "abstract": "&lt;abstract&gt;&lt;p&gt;Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) plays a vital role in the development of computer vision applications. The depth neural network composed of U-shaped structures and jump connections is widely used in various medical image tasks. Recently, based on the self-attention mechanism, the Transformer structure has made great progress and tends to replace CNN, and it has great advantages in understanding global information. In this paper, the ConvWin Transformer structure is proposed, which refers to the W-MSA structure in Swin and combines with the convolution. It can not only accelerate the convergence speed, but also enrich the information exchange between patches and improve the understanding of local information. Then, it is integrated with UNet, a U-shaped architecture commonly used in medical image segmentation, to form a structure called ConvWin-UNet. Meanwhile, this paper improves the patch expanding layer to perform the upsampling operation. The experimental results on the Hubmap datasets and synapse multi-organ segmentation dataset indicate that the proposed ConvWin-UNet structure achieves excellent results.
