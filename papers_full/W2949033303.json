    "abstract": "In this work, an energetic composite fiber, in which 2,6-diamino-3,5-dinitropyrazine-1-oxide (LLM-105) nanoparticles intimately incorporated with a nitrocellulose/glycidyl azide polymer (NC/GAP) fiber, was prepared by the electrospinning method. The morphology and structure of the nanofiber was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-Ray (EDX), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET). The nanofibers possessed a three-dimensional (3D) net structure and a large specific surface area. Thermal analysis, energetic performance, and sensitivities were investigated, and they were compared with NC/GAP and LLM-105 nanoparticles. The NC/GAP/nano-LLM-105 nanofibers show higher decomposition rates and lower decomposition temperatures. The NC/GAP/nano-LLM-105 decomposed to CO2, CO, H2O, N2O, and a few NO, -CH2O-, and -CH- fragments, in the thermal-infrared spectrometry online (TG-IR) measurement. The NC/GAP/nano-LLM-105 nanofibers demonstrated a higher standard specific impulse (Isp), a higher combustion chamber temperature (Tc), and a higher specialty height (H50). The introduction of nano-LLM-105 in the NC/GAP matrix results in an improvement in energetic performance and safety.",
