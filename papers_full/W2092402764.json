Introduction\nRecent interest in the miniaturization of the SMPS, the\npower supply in the consumer electronics and the power con-\nverter in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) and Electric Vehi-\ncle (EV) has spurred a great deal of research into the multi-\nphase techniques for the buck and boost chopper system. It\nis well known that the multi-phase method has a couple of\neﬀectiveness for the miniaturization technique. One is the\nminiaturized cooling system. The other is the miniaturized\noutput capacitor in the buck and boost chopper. In addition\nto this, the transformer-linked method can achieve the minia-\nturization of the inductor volume in the multi-phase power\nconverter system\n(1)–(5). And the several design method for the\ncoupled inductor of the transformer-linked method has been\nproposed to achieve the high power density performance in\nthe power converter system\n(6)–(10). When the coupled inductor\nis designed on the basis of the method that is shown in refer-\nence\n(12), the coupled inductor can be miniaturized to approx-\nimately half size as compared with the non-coupled induc-\ntors. In fact, Fig. 1 shows the comparison result of the induc-\ntor size of the transformer-linked and non-coupled methods\nin multi-phase boost converter. The experiment was evalu-\nated under the condition of the same inductor ripple current\nand ﬂux density between the transformer-linked and the non-\ncoupled inductors.

Comparison result of the inductor size of the\ntransformer-linked and non-coupled methods in the\nmulti-phase boost converter\ntransformer-linked method boost converter is clear in terms\nof compact, lightweight and the lower cost points of view.\nHowever, there is little comparative discussion of the ca-\npacitor size in both the conventional multi-phase method\n(non-coupled method) and the transformer-linked method.\nIn this study, the capacitor size of the multi-phase non-\ncoupled method and the transformer-linked method has been\ndiscussed by using the voltage ripple analysis of the out-\nput capacitor in the boost chopper system. Furthermore,\nthe comparative data of the capacitor size between the non-\ncoupled method and the transformer-linked method are eval-\nuated from the experimental point of view.\n2. Characteristic Analysis Method\nMain factors which determine a capacitor size are capac-\nitance value and withstand voltage.

Therefore, the possibility of downsizing is dis-\ncussed with how much the capacitance value decreases in this\npaper. An equation (1) shows the relational equation among\ncapacitance value C, voltage V\nc which is generated on the\ncapacitor, and charge Qc.\nVc =Qc\nC ········································ (1)\nIt is understood from above equation that ripple voltage\nwhich is generated on a capacitor is determined by capaci-\ntance value C and charge Q\nc. Ripple voltage ΔVc is a pa-\nrameter which decides a circuit performance so that it is sup-\npressed until the standard value generally. Hence, the range\nof ripple voltage ΔVc is possible to evaluate the capacitance\nvalue C by the range of the charge ﬂuctuation ΔQc.T h e r e -\nfore, ﬁrst of all, it is required to analysis charge ﬂuctuation\nΔQ\nc of an output capacitor for discussing downsizing of a ca-\npacitor. Charge is calculated from time waveform’s density\nof capacitor current because of time integration of current.\nHowever, current waveforms of an output capacitor depend\non a condition such as inductor current or duty ratio d.I t\nmeans that a part of calculating density for charge di ﬀers.\nFor that reason, by adapting the change of waveform, it is\nneeded to change the equation to calculate the density.\n3. Characteristic Analysis of Single-phase Method\nA charge characteristic analysis of the output smoothing\ncapacitor of the single-phase method, which is shown in\nFig. 2, is carried out in this section. The charge quantity\nof when the capacitor current is positive is equal to the one\nof when the capacitor current is negative by discharge and\ncharge equilibrium condition of a capacitor. For that reason,\nthe quantity of the charge ﬂuctuation can be calculated by\nmeans of the calculating the charge quantity of the discharge\nor charge time in case of analyzing charge ﬂuctuation. As-\nsuming that the diode current is i\nd, the current waveform of\nthe output smoothing capacitor should be described as Fig. 3.\nThe current I\ndp and ILpp show the peak value of the diode cur-\nrent and ripple value of the inductor current respectively. In\nthis time, each peak value of the output smoothing capacitor\ncurrent is expressed as\nI\nc\n A\n sin =Idp −Io ······························· (2)\nIc\n B\n sin =Idp −ILpp −Io ························· (3)\nAnd also, the charge quantity of the discharge and charge\ntime can be calculated from these equations of the peak value.\nAt this point, the time integrated values of the current i\nd\nwhich is supplied from the diode and current which is out-\nputted to the load for one switching cycle became equal.\nThat’s why the following equation is derived.\n1\n2 ·\n(\nIdp +Idp −ILpp\n)\n·Toﬀ =Io ·Ts ··············· (4)\nOn the other hand, because the peak value of the diode cur-\nrent Idp and relational equation of the average inductor cur-\nrent IL,a n d ILpp is expressed as the equation (5), the output\ncurrent Io is described as equation (6) from (4) and (5).\nIdp =IL +1\n2 ·ILpp ······························ (5)\nFig. 2.

Characteristic Analysis of Multi-phase Method\nIn this section, a charge characteristic analysis of the out-\nput smoothing capacitor of a non-coupled multi-phase boost\nchopper circuit in Fig. 6 is carried out. In case of the multi-\nphase method, the characteristic of the output capacitor cur-\nrent i\nc changes on the border of the duty ratio 0.5 because\neach phase of the current overlaps each other in the output\nside. Accordingly, separating the cases of d < 0.5a n d d ≥\n0.5 is required on analysis. Furthermore, each phase of the\nvariation related to parasitic parameters doesn’t exist when\nanalyzing and also, each phase of the average current is as-\nsumed to be equal.\nFirst, the case of d < 0.5 is investigated.

As depicted in Fig. 7, it is under-\nstood that the output capacitor current which each phase of\nthe diode current overlaps is generated under the condition of\nd < 0.5.

In the range of equation (19) where\nthe waveform of Form1 is formed, the quantity of the charge\nﬂuctuation ΔQ\nc\n mul\n d<0.5\n 1 is expressed as\nΔQC\n mul\n d<0.5\n 1 =1\n4 ·\n(\n2 ·d +1\n2 ·1 −2 ·d\n1 −d ·ILpp\n mul\nIL\n mul\n)2\n·(1 −d) · I2\nL\n mul\nILpp\n mul\n·Ts ········ (22)\nFig. 9.

Each phase of the\ndiode current doesn’t overlap and ﬂows into the output ca-\npacitor under the condition of d ≥0.5. Thus, the generated\noutput capacitor current becomes such as Fig. 9. In this case,\nthe waveform pattern is equal to the one of the single-phase\nmethod. However, the current which ﬂows into the output\ncapacitor shows the double frequency of the switching fre-\nquency and then the cycle of the waveforms becomes half\nbecause the switching pattern cycle for the switches is shifted\nwith a 180\n◦.

In case of\nForm3, a range of the duty ratio,dmtl\n d<0.5\n 3 is as follows from\nIc\n C\n mtl ≥0\ndmtl\n d<0.5\n 3 ≥1\n2 −1\n4 ·ILpp\n mtl\nIL\n mtl\n··················· (36)\nA range of Form2 exists in the ﬁeld between Form2 and\nTable 3. Circuit parameters (transformer-linked multi-\nphase)\nFig. 15. Output voltage ripple of the transformer-linked\nmulti-phase boost chopper circuit\nForm3. Accordingly, a range of the duty ratio, dmtl\n d<0.5\n 2\nis given by\n1\n2 ·ILpp\n mtl\nIL\n mtl\n≤dmtl\n d<0.5\n 2 < 1\n2 −1\n4 ·ILpp\n mtl\nIL\n mtl\n····· (37)\nNext, the quantity of the charge ﬂuctuation ΔQc is derived\nwith these three ranges. In the range of equation (35) where\nthe waveform of Form1 is formed, the quantity of the charge\nﬂuctuation ΔQc\n mtl\n d<0.5\n 1 is expressed as\nΔQC\n mtl\n d<0.5\n 1 =1\n4 ·\n(\n2 ·d +ILpp\n mtl\nIL\n mtl\n)2\n·\n(1\n2 −d\n)\n·\nI2\nL\n mtl\nILpp\n mtl\n·Ts ········ (38)\nLikewise, in the range of equation (37) where waveform\nof Form2 is formed, the quantity of the charge ﬂuctuation\nΔQ\nc\n mtl\n d<0.5\n 2 is represented as\nΔQC\n mtl\n d<0.5\n 2 =ILpp\n mtl\nIL\n mtl\n·(1 −2 ·d) ·d ·\nI2\nL\n mtl\nILpp\n mtl\n·Ts\n··················· (39)\nAnd also, in the range of equation (36) where waveform\nof Form3 is formed, the quantity of the charge ﬂuctuation\nΔQ\nc\n mtl\n d<0.5\n 3 is described as\nΔQC\n mtl\n d<0.5\n 3 =1\n8 ·\n{\n2 ·(1 −2 ·d) +ILpp\n mtl\nIL\n mtl\n}2\n·d ·\nI2\nL\n mtl\nILpp\n mtl\n·Ts ··············· (40)\nEach phase of the diode current doesn’t overlap and ﬂows\ninto the output capacitor under the condition of d ≥ 0.5.\nThus, the current waveforms of transformer-linked method\nare also the same as a conventional multi-phase boost chop-\nper. The quantity of the charge ﬂuctuation and the ﬁeld di-\nvision related to the charge calculation is the same as a con-\nventional method as well. For that reason, it is understood\n257 IEEJ Journal IA, Vol.2, No.5, 2013\nAnalysis of Output V oltage Ripple in Multi-Phase ConverterʢJun Imaoka et al.ʣ\nTable 4. Relational equations of charge ﬂuctuation (In\ncase of ILpp/IL =1/2)\nthat the quantity ΔQc\n mtl\n d≥0.5\n 1 of the charge ﬂuctuation on\ntransformer-linked method shows the same calculation re-\nsults as the equation (29). In the same way, the equation for\nthe quantity ΔQc\n mtl\n d≥0.5\n 2 of the charge ﬂuctuation is equal\nto a conventional equation (30).\nThe output ripple voltage is measured from the experiment\nand the validity of the derived equation is now discussed.\nThe ripple voltage ΔV\nc is expressed as the equation (11), and\nthen the theoretical value is compared with the measurement\nvalue. In this experiment, using the current balance con-\ntrol\n(13) (14), each phase of the average current is balanced. The\ntheoretical value of the output ripple voltage from the duty\nratio 0.1 to 0.7 with the circuit parameters in Table 3 is de-\npicted in Fig. 15. On the other hand, the experimental result\nof the output voltage ripple with the same circuit parameters\nis plotted in Fig. 15. From this result, in case of multi-phase\nmethod, the output ripple voltage becomes lower up to the\nduty ratio 0.5 gradually, and then from the duty ratio 0.5, the\noutput ripple voltage becomes larger.\nMoreover, the theoretical value agrees with the experiment\nvalue closely. As a result, the validity of calculation equation\nconcerning the quantity ΔQ\nc of the charge ﬂuctuation for the\ntransformer-linked multi-phase boost chopper circuit is veri-\nﬁed.\n6. Comparison of Voltage Ripple Characteristic\nCharacteristic evaluation concerning downsizing of the\noutput capacitor is now discussed by comparing the voltage\nripple characteristic of three circuit topology which the valid-\nity is veriﬁed from the experiment. In this section, the relative\nevaluation between multi-phase method’s output capacitor\nfor downsizing is carried out. And meanwhile, the diﬀerence\nbetween conventional multi-phase method and transformer-\nlinked multi-phase method is investigated. The comparison\ncondition is that the ratio I\nLpp/IL of inductor current ripple\nis 1/2, switching frequency fs is 50 kHz (Ts =20 µs), out-\nput current Io is 10A, and output capacitance Co =10 µFf o r\nthree circuit topology. We have to go through three steps in\norder to compare the capacitor voltage ripple of each circuit\ntopology. Firstly, it is necessary to derive the range of the\nFig. 16. Comparison result for voltage ripple character-\nistic of the output capacitor (absolute evaluation)\nFig. 17. Comparison result for voltage ripple character-\nistic of the output capacitor (relative comparison)\nduty ratio corresponding to the charge ﬂuctuation of the ca-\npacitor. For instance, the boundary of Form1 and Form2 is\nd =0.25 when we substitute I\nLpp/IL =1/2 for equations (7),\n(8) of the single phase method.\nSecondly, the equations (9), (10) and (6) are applied on\nthe boundary of this duty ratio respectively in case of single-\nphase method, and the quantity ΔQc of the charge ﬂuctuation\nis calculated. (The equations of the charge ﬂuctuation corre-\nsponding to each duty ratio range in each method are shown\nin Table 4).\nFinally, the voltage ripple ΔV\nc is expressed from equation\n(11). Likewise, when this process is applied to the non-\ncoupled and transformer-linked methods respectively, we can\ncompare the voltage ripple ΔV\nc. Based on the above the\nprocedure, the result of absolute comparison for the voltage\nripple characteristics of output capacitor among three circuit\ntopology are shown in Fig. 16. From this ﬁgure, the ampli-\ntude of the output voltage ripples concerning the non-coupled\nand the transformer-linked methods are suppressed as com-\npared with single-phase method in the all duty range. And\nalso, to compare three methods relatively, the characteristic\nof ratio of the output voltage amplitude ΔV\no\n mul/ΔVo\n sinis\nshown in Fig. 17. This is the characteristic single-phase and\nconventional multi-phase methods to the duty ratio. Like-\nwise, the characteristic of the amplitude of the output voltage\nripple regarding single-phase and transformer-linked multi-\nphase methods to the duty ratio is plotted in Fig. 17. As seen\nin Fig. 17, the amplitude of the output voltage ripple con-\n258 IEEJ Journal IA, Vol.2, No.5, 2013\nAnalysis of Output V oltage Ripple in Multi-Phase ConverterʢJun Imaoka et al.ʣ\ncerning the non-coupled method and the transformer-linked\nmethod are suppressed less than half of single-phase method\nin the all duty range. Furthermore, it is conﬁrmed that the re-\nduction of the amplitude of the output voltage ripple less than\none-tenth around the duty ratio 0.5. And also, the character-\nistic which conventional method of the amplitude of the out-\nput voltage ripple becomes smaller than transformer-linked\nmethod is described in the portion of the range less than the\nduty ratio 0.5. This reason is the equations (22) and (38),\n(24) and (40) are di ﬀerent on the result of analysis concern-\ning the charge ﬂuctuation on the output capacitor. In the duty\nratio less than 0.5, the quantity of the charge ﬂuctuation on\nthe output capacitor depends on the ripple form of the ﬂow-\ning diode current because the each phase of the diode current\noverlaps. The diode current of transformer-linked method in\nFig. 13 is aﬀected by applying the coupled inductor and each\nphase of the switching operation. Owing to this reason, on\nthe non-coupled and the transformer-linked methods, the rip-\nple forms of the diode currents which ﬂow through the out-\nput capacitor are di ﬀerent even though their ripple ratio is\ncorresponded. Especially, this di ﬀerence of the ripple form\ninﬂuences to the peak value of the output capacitor’s cur-\nrent. The current I\nc\n A\n mul of the non-coupled method obtains\nlarger under the condition which the ripple ratio is the same\neven when comparing the current I\nc\n A\n mtl of the transformer-\nlinked method. Accordingly, the quantity of the charge ﬂuc-\ntuation of the Form1 of non-coupled and transformer-linked\nmethods derive from the current I\nc\n A\n mul and Ic\n A\n mtl so that\nthe disparity to the quantity of the charge ﬂuctuation occurs\nsuch as the equations (22) and (38) in the same multi-phase\nmethod. Likewise, the disparity of the current I\nc\n C\n mul of\nnon-coupled method and Ic\n C\n mtl of the transformer-linked\nmethod due to the di ﬀerence ripple form of the diode cur-\nrent between the non-coupled and transformer-linked meth-\nods. Consequently, it is considered that there is the di ﬀer-\nent quantity of the charge ﬂuctuation between Form3 of the\nnon-coupled and transformer-linked methods. These di ﬀer-\nent characteristic is not much bigger and a factor for denying\nusefulness of transformer-linked method.\n7. Conclusions\nThe miniaturization possibility of the output capacitor in\nthe transformer-linked method boost chopper system is eval-\nuated and discussed in this paper. From the comparative\nvoltage ripple analysis of the output capacitor for the con-\nventional non-coupled method and the transformer-linked\nmethod, it can be conclude that there is no di ﬀerence of the\noutput capacitor size in each type of converter from same ca-\npacitance value point of view. The experimental ratio data\nof the capacitor charge ripple suggest that the transformer-\nlinked method power converter can achieve higher power\ndensity because of the performance of the downsized capaci-\ntor as compared with the conventional non-coupled method.\nReferences\n( 1 ) M.
