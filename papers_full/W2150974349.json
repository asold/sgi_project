INTRODUCTION \nSpatial data of indoor environments , where we spend a \nconsiderable amount of our time , are important for a variety of \napplications. For most buildings the available spatial data are \neither 2D floor plans or design building information models \n(BIM), which do not represent the current stat e of the building. \nHowever, many applications such as crisis management, routing \nand navigation, energy efficiency analysis, structural health \nmonitoring and maintenance planning require u p-to-date 3D \nindoor models with rich semantics.  \n \nCurrently, 3D indoor modelling is mostly a manual procedure, \nwhich is time consuming and labour intensive. Several methods \nhave been developed to a utomatically generate indoor model s \nbased on imagery and/or point cloud data . These methods can \nbe divided into two main categories: surface -based and \nvolumetric reconstruction methods . Surface -based methods \nrecognize the structural elements of the indoor environment, i.e. \nwalls, floors and ceilings, to generate a boundary represe ntation \n(B-rep) model (Budroni and Boehm, 2010 ; Sanchez and \nZakhor, 2012 ; Valero et al., 2012 ; Díaz-Vilariño et al., 2013 ; \nXiong et al., 2013 ). While B-rep models are more suitable for \nvisualization, they are  less useful in applications that require \nknowledge of the interior spaces and their topological relations, \ne.g. routing and navigation. Volumetric approaches model the \nindoor environment  as a combinati on of volumetric spaces  \n(Jenke et al., 2009 ; Xiao and Furukawa, 2012 ; Oesau et al., \n2014), which are more suitable for performing complex spatial \nanalysis. However, methods for fitting volumetric primitives to \nthe data are usually  restricted to simple indoor architectures , \nand are susceptible to inaccuracy and incompleteness of  the \ndata.  \n \nThe challenge in recognizing interior spaces is to understand the \nprinciples of indoor architectural design  and translate them into \na modelling algorithm. Indoor architecture is characterized with \nthree elements: repetition, regularity and creativity. Regular \nstructures like cuboid spaces repeatedly appear in indoor \nenvironments but in very many different configurations \nreflecting the creativity of the architect. A design principle that \ncombines these elements and explains their working in \narchitecture is the shape grammar  (Stiny, 2008 ). It establishes \nthat different designs can be made by iteratively combining \nsimple shapes according to some rules, the same way a language \nis defined by words constructing sentences acc ording to \ngrammar rules. \n \nIn this paper we present a method for the modelling of indoor \nenvironments based on a simple shape grammar. Other types of \ngrammar have been used for modelling interior spaces by \nBecker et al. (2013 ). In our approach, w e derive our shape \ngrammar from an architectural indoor design concept known as \nthe Palladian grammar (Stiny and Mitchell, 1978 ). We also \npresent methods for learning the grammar rules and their \nparameters from a point cloud. \n \nThe rest of the paper is organ ized as follows. Section 2 \nintroduces the shape grammar for modelling indoor spaces.  \nSection 3 describes the methods for learning the grammar rules \nfrom a point cloud . In Section 4 experiments with a number of \nsimulated and real point clouds of indoor environments are \ndescribed and the results are discussed . A short discussion on \nthe representation of semantics in 3D indoor model s \nreconstructed by shape grammar is presented in Section 5. \n    \nThe International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences, Volume XL-5, 2014\nISPRS Technical Commission V Symposium, 23 – 25 June 2014, Riva del Garda, Italy\nThis contribution has been peer-reviewed.\ndoi:10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-5-321-2014\n321\n \n2. A SIMPLE SHAPE GRAMMAR FOR INDOOR \nMODELLING \nWe define a parametric shape grammar similar to the Palladian \ngrammar which has been used to describe Palladian style indoor \ndesigns (Stiny and Mitchell, 1978 ). Figure 1 shows examples of \nPalladian architectural designs generated by a simplified shape \ngrammar, consisting of a starting symbol (a grid of rectangular \nspaces - Figure 1a), and two production rules (first merging \nspaces by collapsing intermediate walls, and then inserting \naligned windows and doors). This method can be easily \nextended to 3D. For 3D modelling of interior spaces, we use a \nunit cube as the starting symbol (as it represents a 3D \nsubspace), and three production rules that generate non-terminal \nsymbols (intermediate cuboid spaces)  and terminal symbols \n(final interior spaces). The following are the rules: \n- R1\nplace_cuboid: S  H·S \nApplies a transformation H to the unit cube  S and places \nthe transformed cuboid. Currently , H consists of a \ntranslation vector with tx, ty, tz and three scale parameters \nsx, sy, sz. This would restrict the modelling to indoor \nenvironments with Manhattan-World structure. For non -\nManhattan-World buildi ngs H can be easily extended to \ninclude also a rotation around the z axis.  \n- R2\nconnect_cuboids: {N1, N2}  N3 \nConnects two neighbouring non-terminal cuboids, N1 and \nN2, which are not separated with a wall by making a new \nnon-terminal cuboid N3 in between them.  \n- R3\nmerge_cuboids: {N1, N2}  N3 (T) \n Merges two adjacent non-terminal cuboids, N1 and N2, by \ncalculating the  Boolean union of the two cuboids. The \nresulting solid can be a non -terminal (N3) or a terminal \n(T) depending on whether or not it can be merged further.  \n \nThese rules produce a 3D model of the interior spaces  in the \nform of volumetric solids . To add further details like doors and \nwindows the rule set can be extended with additional rules. \n \n3. LEARNING GRAMMAR RULES AND THEIR \nPARAMATERS \nThe grammar rules already facilitate interactive modelling of \ninterior spaces. Placing a cuboid by the first rule can be easily \ndone manually, or to generate a 3D grid of cuboids the user \nonly needs to specify the location of the floors and the walls. To \napply the other two rules the user only needs to select two \ncuboids. \n \nGiven a point cloud of the interior spaces, however, it is \npossible to learn the parameters and sequence of the rules \nautomatically. In an indoor environment which does not deviate \ntoo much from the  Manhattan-World assumptions, the \ndistribution of the points in the point cloud provides \ninformation on the position of the main structural elements, and \ncan be used to estimate the parameters of the grammar rules.  \n \nTo enable reasoning based on the point distribution the point \ncloud should be first rotated such that the main walls are \nparallel to the x- and y axes and the floor and ceiling are parallel \nto the x-y plane. The rotation parameters can be estimated from \nthe distribution of the normal vectors. As shown in Figure 2, the \nnormals form three clusters corresponding to the orientation of \nthe main walls and the floors/ceilings. We use a simple k-means \nclustering method to find the three cluster centres , and use these \nto estimate the three rotation parameters that align the point \ncloud. \nFigure 1. By applying grammar rules to a grid of rectangular \nspaces (a) various Palladian indoor designs can be generated (b \nto h). \n \nOnce the point cloud is aligned, the distribution of the z-\ncoordinate of the points provides information on the number of \nstoreys of the building. The peaks in the histogram of z-\ncoordinates correspond to the floors and ceilings in the point \ncloud. Each pair of adjacent peaks  with a difference larger than \n3 to 4 meters in z corresponds to a building storey. By \nautomatic extraction of the histogram peaks the locations of the \nfloors and ceilings are identified, and the point cloud can be \ndivided into subclouds corresponding to the individual storeys \nof the building. Each storey is then modelled separately by \napplying the grammar rules. \n \nThe first rule contains transformation parameters that determine \nthe location and size of a cuboid such that it corresponds to an \nactual sub space of the interior. In an aligned point cloud, the \nhistograms of the point coordinates in x, y and z are \ncharacterized with peaks that correspond to the location and \nsize of the sub spaces. Each pair of adjacent histogram peaks \nthat have a distance larger than the normal thickness of the \nwalls determines the location and size of a sub space, whereas \ncloser peaks correspond to walls and non-navigable spaces.  \n \nFigure 2. The normal vectors of an indoor point cloud (a)  form \nthree clusters corresponding to the direction of the walls and \nfloors/ceilings (b). The cluster centres are used to estimate the \nrotation parameters that align the point cloud (c). \n \n(a) \n \n(b) \n \n(c) \n \n(d) \n \n(e) \n \n(f) \n \n(g) \n \n(h) \n \n(a) \n \n(b) \n \n(c) \nThe International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences, Volume XL-5, 2014\nISPRS Technical Commission V Symposium, 23 – 25 June 2014, Riva del Garda, Italy\nThis contribution has been peer-reviewed.\ndoi:10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-5-321-2014\n322\n \nTo place each cuboid based on the parameters automatically \nderived from the histograms a points-on-ceiling constraint must \nbe satisfied. This means that the cuboid should have points on \nits top face ( the cuboid’s ceiling); otherwise, it is inconsistent \nwith the definition of an interior space. To decide whether or \nnot a cuboid has  points on its ceiling we define a points-on-\nceiling index:  \n \nceiling\nPoC\nA\nnI\n2\n (1) \n \nwhere n is the number of points that fall within a small buffer \naround the cuboid ’s ceiling, Aceiling is the area of the cuboid ’s \nceiling and δ is the average point spacing in the point cloud.  \nWhen the cuboid’s ceiling touches an actual surface in the point \ncloud the point-on-ceiling index will be close to one; otherwise, \nit will be close to zero.  \n \nWhen placing the cuboids , each cuboid is given a pair of grid \ncoordinates according to the location of its corresponding peaks  \nin the histograms of the point coordinates in  x and y. From the \ngrid coordinates neighbourhood relations between cuboids can \nbe derived, which is used by the second rule. \n \nThe second rule connects neighbouring cuboids that are not \nseparated by a n interior  wall. The location and size of the \nconnecting cuboid is derived from the coordinates of the \nvertices of the two cuboids that are closest to each other. To \ndetermine whether the connecting cuboid is on empty space or \non an interior wall we define a points-on-walls index: \n \nwall\nPoW\nA\nnI\n2\n (2) \n \nwhich is similar to equation (1) , except here n is calculated as \nthe number of points that fall within a small buffer around the \ncuboid’s lateral faces (cuboid’s walls), and Awall is the total area \nof the cuboid’s walls.  \n \nThe second rule is applied iteratively until no more two \nneighbouring cuboids  can be connected. In some cases all \ncuboids are already adjacent from the beginning, for example \nwhen modelling a single space without interior walls,  or when \nthe cuboids are placed manually such that there is no empty \nspace between them. In such a case the connecting cuboid will \nhave one scale parameter of zero, which indicates that the rule \nwill have no effect. \n \nThe third rule merges adjacent cuboids. This would simply \nrequire finding non -terminal cuboids that have a common face, \nand calculating their Boolean union . This rule is also applied \niteratively until no more two adjacent cuboids are found.  At the \nend of the iterations , all remaining cuboids are designated as  \nterminal spaces.  \n \n4. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS \nThe grammar and the methods for learning it from a point cloud \nwas implemented in Matlab ® environment. Whi le for spaces \nwith a Manhattan-World structure we perform the entire \nreconstruction process in Matlab, for more complex interiors we \nexport the grammar rules as a Python script to FreeCAD \nsoftware (www. freecadweb.org), which is better suited for  \noperations on solids, particularly the Boolean union operation. \nPreliminary experiments were carried out using a simulated \npoint cloud of a two -storey building and a real point cloud \nacquired by terrestrial laser scanning  of a large interior space.  \nFor the generation of the rules a number of parameters should \nbe predefined. Table 1 lists the settings used in the two \nexperiments. The average point spacing and the buffer size are \nset respectively based on the density and noise level of the point \ncloud. The maximum wall thickness is based on prior \nknowledge of the building. The choice of histogram bin size \ndoes not have a significant effect on the performance of the \nmethod, and a value between 5 and 20 cm is usually suitable. \n \nTable 1. Parameter settings used in the experiments. \nParameter \n \nDataset \nHistogram \nbin size \n(m) \nMax wall \nthickness \n(m) \nCeiling/wall \nbuffer  \n(m) \nAverage \npoint \nspacing \n(m) \nSimulated  0.05 0.50 0.05 0.05 \nReal data 0.05 0.10 0.05 0.10 \n \n4.1 Results for the simulated point cloud \nThe simulated point cloud of an imaginary two -storey building \nwas created with an average point spacing of 5 cm and a noise \nlevel of 5 cm. Figure 3 shows the simulated point cloud. \n \nFigure 4 shows the histogram of z coordinates of the  simulated \npoint cloud , which contains four distinct peaks . To extract the \npeaks we simply find the bins that have a greater count than \ntheir neighbours, with the constraint that if two peaks are found \nless than 5 bins apart the lower peak is eliminated.  More \nelaborate techniques such as the mean shift (Comaniciu and \nMeer, 2002) or fitting a spline curve to local maxima (Li et al., \n2004) can also be used, but we found that this simple technique \nyields satisfactory results. \n \nThe distance between the first two peaks and that between the  \nlast two peak s determine the heights of the two storeys of the \nbuilding. These are used a s an estimate of sz for the cuboid \nplacement in each storey. The bin between the two close peaks , \nwhich has the lowest count is used to di vide the point cloud to \ntwo sub clouds. The grammar ru les are then applied to the \nsubclouds corresponding to each storey separately.  \n \nFigure 5 shows the histograms of the x- and y coordinates of \neach storey, from which the location and size of the cuboids are \nderived. In essence, the peaks in the se histograms define a \npartitioning of the poin t cloud into a set of 3D cuboids. \nHowever, those peaks that are closer than the predefined wall \nthickness ( see Table 1 ) represent points on the two sides of a \nwall, and are therefore not used to instantiate the cuboid \nplacement rule. \n \n \n(a) \n \n(b) \nFigure 3.

The histogram of z coordinates showing distinct peaks \ncorresponding to the two storeys of the building. \n \nFigure 6 shows the cuboids generated by  iteratively applying \nthe cuboid placement rule parameterized based on the peaks in \nthe histograms of x-, y- and z coordinates. \n \nIn addition to the cuboid parameters, the neighbourhood \nrelation between the cuboids is also derived from the peaks in \nthe histograms. This facilitates the application of the second \nrule. Every pair of neighbouring cuboids are connected \nprovided that the connecting cuboid is not on a wall. Figure 7 \nshows the distribution of points-on-wall ind ices calculated for  \ncuboids placed in  empty spaces and for those placed on  walls. \nClearly, the indices for the two types of spaces are quite \ndistinct, even though most empty spaces are adjacent to a wall \nfrom one or two sides. Based  on Figure 7, a threshold of 0. 5 \nwas chosen to distinguish between empty spaces and walls.  \n \nFigure 8 shows the result of iteratively applying the second rule \nto connect the cuboids that are not separated with a wall.  The \nfinal spaces produced by iteratively applying the merge rule are \nshown in Figure 9. Overall, the final model of the first floor was \ncreated by 42 times application of the first rule (place cuboid), \n52 times application of the second rule (connect cuboids) and \n102 times application of the third rule (merge cuboids). For the \nmodel of the second floor, which has a simpler design, the \nnumber of rule applications were 16, 12 and 25, respectively for \nthe first, second and the third rule.  All rules were generated , \nparameterized and applied fully automatically. \nFigure 5.

Figure 10 shows a low-\ndensity version of the point cloud.  \n \nFigure 11 shows t he histograms of z-, x- and y coordinates and \nthe extracted peaks used for the placement of cuboids . In the \nhistogram of z coordinates only two peaks we re found , \nindicating that there is only one storey. The peaks in the \nhistogram of x- and y coordinates were used to apply the cuboid \nplacement rule. The result is shown in Figure 12(a). As it can be \nseen, two cuboids are missing in the middle of the interior \nspace. Examining Figure 10 reveals a gap in the  ceiling caused \nby an inner patio connecting the floors of the building. Because \nof this gap the points-on-ceiling constraint was not satisfied for \nthis part of the point cloud, and so no cuboids were placed \nthere. Those cuboids can be placed manually  by providing \nappropriate position and scale parameters to the first rule , or by \ndisabling the point -on-ceiling constraint temporarily. Figure  \n12(b) shows the result of cuboid placement with the two \ncuboids placed manually.   \n \nSince the interior space in this experiment did not contain any \ninterior walls there were no empty spaces left between the \ncuboids. Therefore, the second rule for connecti ng the cuboids \nhad no effect, and the adjacent cuboids could already be \n \n(a) \n \n(b) \nThe International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences, Volume XL-5, 2014\nISPRS Technical Commission V Symposium, 23 – 25 June 2014, Riva del Garda, Italy\nThis contribution has been peer-reviewed.\ndoi:10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-5-321-2014\n324\n \nmerged. Figure 13 shows the final model generated by merging \nadjacent cuboids through iterative application of the third rule.  \nOverall, the final model of the interior space was created by 16 \ntimes application of the first rule (place cuboid ) and 23 times \napplication of the third rule (merge cuboids).  The second rule \n(connect cuboids) was applied, but did not create any \nconnecting cuboids. \n \n \nFigure 10.

REPRESENTATION OF SEMANTICS \nUsing the shape grammar , an indoor environment is modelled \nas a confi guration of parameterized spaces. Such a model \ncontains semantics like height and volume  of the spaces  and \ntheir topological relation ships. Knowledge about the \nconfiguration of interior spaces and relations between them is \nthe basis for the representation of semantically rich 3D building \nmodels both in the world of Building Information Models \n(BIM) and in the world of 3D GIS. While topological \nrelationships between elements are inherent in both cases, the \ngeometric detail and the semantic content depend on the \napplication area for which models are created. \n \nIn the world of 3D GIS, the C ityGML standard represents \nbuilding interiors as navigable and non -navigable spaces in \nmodels at level of detail 4 (LoD-4). While presently our models \nconsist of navigable spaces, non-navigable spaces can be  easily \nmodelled by placing cuboids on walls using the points-on-walls \nindex (See Figure 7) . Also the grammar can be extended to \nmodel openings like doors and windows. In CityGML, openings \nthat connect spaces represent adjacency between them, since the \nsurface that represents t he opening is part of the boundaries of \nboth spaces. Th e adjacency relationship between spaces though \nopenings can be used to derive an  accessibility graph for indoor \nnavigation or for determining the spread of gas or smoke.  \n \nIn the world of BI M, the gbXML standard was exclusively \ndeveloped in order to support all the information necessary for \nenergy analysis applications. In terms of geometry, the \nstructural elements of a building (i.e. walls, ceilings and floors) \nare represented as planar surfaces each being adjacent to two \nspaces. These surfaces can be simply obtained from the \nvolumetric spaces ( See Figure 13 ). The adjacency  relations, \nwhich is  fundamental for heat transfer calculation between \nspaces, can also be passed from the spaces to the surfaces and \nstored as part of their semantic content. \n \n6. CONCLUSIONS \nIn this paper we presented an approach to 3D modelling of \nindoor environments based on a shape grammar. It was shown \nthat indoor environments can be modelled by iteratively \nplacing, connecting and merging cuboid shapes. We also \npresented methods for learni ng the parameters and sequence of \nthe rules from a point cloud.  \n \nThe shape grammar presented in this paper can be used to \nmodel a variety of indoor architectures.
