    "abstract": "Accurately recommending candidate news to users is a basic challenge of personalized news recommendation systems.Traditional methods are usually difficult to learn and acquire complex semantic information in news texts, resulting in unsatisfactory recommendation results.Besides, these traditional methods are more friendly to active users with rich historical behaviors.However, they can not effectively solve the long tail problem of inactive users.To address these issues, this research presents a novel general framework that combines Large Language Models (LLM) and Knowledge Graphs (KG) into traditional methods.To learn the contextual information of news text, we use LLMs' powerful text understanding ability to generate news representations with rich semantic information, and then, the generated news representations are used to enhance the news encoding in traditional methods.In addition, multi-hops relationship of news entities is mined and the structural information of news is encoded using KG, thus alleviating the challenge of long-tail distribution.Experimental results demonstrate that compared with various traditional models, on evaluation indicators such as AUC, MRR, nDCG@5 and nDCG@10, the framework significantly improves the recommendation performance.The successful integration of LLM and KG in our framework has established a feasible way for achieving more accurate personalized news recommendation.",
