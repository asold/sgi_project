    "abstract": "Mineral oil is the most popular insulating liquid for high voltage transformers due to its function as a cooling liquid and an electrical insulator. Kraft paper has been widely used as transformer solid insulation for a long time already. The degradation process of transformer paper due to thermal aging in mineral oil can change the physical and chemical structure of the cellulose paper. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analysis was used to identify changes in the chemical structure of transformer paper aged in mineral oil. FTIR results show that the intensity of the peak absorbance of the O–H functional group decreased with aging but the intensity of the peak absorbance of the C–H and C=O functional groups increased with aging. Changes in the chemical structure of the cellulose paper during thermal aging in mineral oil can be analyzed by an oxidation process of the cellulose paper and the reaction process between the carboxylic acids in the mineral oil and the hydroxyl groups on the cellulose. The correlation between the functional groups and the average number of chain scissions of transformer paper gives initial information that the transformer paper performance can be identified by using a spectroscopic technique as a non-destructive diagnostic technique.",
