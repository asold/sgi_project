INTRODUCTION \nSCADA is a system that can carry out the process of data acquisition, control, and monitoring of \nindustrial control systems [1] . The SCADA element consists of three parts, namely the field device, remote \nterminal unit (RTU), master terminal unit (MTU)  [2], [3] . Data from the field device is sent to the RTU \n(PLC), then sent to the MTU. Data communication between PLC and MTU uses RS232C serial \ncommunication. Data from MTU will be sent to the server  [4]-[6]. The reliability of the SCADA system \naffects the operation of the micro -network [7]. The effective design of the supervision and data acquisition \ncontrol system (SCADA) system for micro networks including front -end processing modules, \ncommunication gateway modules, and surveillance control modules is presented in this study and then  the \nSCADA micro -network system is built  [3], [8]. The actual micro -network operation test is done using the \nSCADA system. The experimental results sh ow that the design and method of implementing a micro -\nSCADA system is practical and feasible  [4], [9], [10]. Research studies with remote electricity monitoring \n\nInt J Artif Intell ISSN: 2252-8938 \n  \n \nFuzzy mamdani logic inference model in the loading of distribution substation… (Rahma Farah Ningrum) \n299 \nand control using a web browser using TCP/IP protocols that support cellular systems  [11]. It contains basic \nanalog input/output and basic digital input/output which can be applied to motor drivers and inverters for \nintegration with remote SCAD A systems based on IoT, and thus achieve efficient power management  [12]-\n[14]. The study was conducted using a model based on the fuzzy inference system (FIS) to evaluate the \nperformance of the bl ock cipher algorithm based on three current metrics  [15]-[17]. Two types of FIS \nmodels, the Mamdani FIS model, and the Sugeno FIS model were used for this evaluation. The fuzzy \ninference system was developed for the block cipher algorithm using two types of fuzzy mod els [18-20]. The \narena of the importance of performance in our online system compares the Mamdani model, which was used \nbefore, with the Sugeno formulation using four types of membership function methods (MF) [21]. The first \nmethod of the triangular membership function uses the avera ge, minimum and maximum values of the \nhistogram attribute. The second approach produces a triangular membership function using a peak and \nstandard deviation of attribute values. The third procedure produces a gaussian membership function using \nthe mean a nd standard deviation the histogram attribute values. The fourth approach produces a gaussian \nmembership function using the peak and standard deviations of the histogram attribute values [22], [23]. \n \n \n2. RESEARCH METHOD  \nComparison with other studies is the SCADA model with fuzzy Mamdani logic. Fuzzy logic method \nis a method that can be applied to data input in the form of linguistic variables, namely variables that are \nnatural or obtained from humans. Output obtained by the method of fuzzy set [24]-[26]. The system design \nthat will be made has several steps in its completion. The design that is designed is necessary so that the \nsystem to be implemented does not go out of its original destination [27], [28]. There are 3 transformers \nwhere each transformer has a current sensor and a voltage sensor. The transformer consists of a current \nsensor and a voltage sensor (current and voltage value detector), a DC Step Up to add voltage, an L sED \nindicator for each substation, a buzzer as an alarm, an LCD and a power supply. Whereas for human machine \ninterface (HMI) there is an interface on the PC with the vb.net application which will monitor the SCADA \nsystem on the transforme r or substation, this interface uses communication connected to a serial USB where \nto connect between the microcontroller and the PC  [4]. The system will be displayed in the form of \nmonitoring devices in real -time in terms of telemetering functions measuring current, voltage, and power \nregulation while functions in telecontrolling and telesignalling in turning off and turning on substations or \nperforming substation recovery systems with notific ation at the time of travel, while for data acquisition \nlocated monitoring history and SAIFI SAIDI reports on substation trips. \nIn the system in Figure 1, system input consists of: \n1. The transformer measurement input data is detected on the current and voltage sensors. \n2. DC step up CN6009 is used to raise the voltage to a voltage higher than the DC load input source \n3.

RESULTS AND ANALYSIS \nAfter performing an experiment or operation, the data is collected in a database. The data processing \ncollected will be displayed in this form as shown in Figure 3. The results of the data processing are called \nSAIDI and SAIFI. SAIDI is the result of a long blackout in a second, while SAIFI is how many feeders \nexperience problems in a day. Limits for SAIDI and SAIFI are per second and per day. This is taken because \nit follows the simulation that will be carried out in real-time.  \nIn this sensor system, as shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5, the method used is fuzzy m amdani logic, \nthere are two input variables, namely current and voltage.
