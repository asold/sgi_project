  "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title> Effective communication plays a pivotal role in mitigating health disparities. However, linguistic differences, such as African American Vernacular English (AAVE), can lead to communication gaps between patients and physicians, consequently impacting healthcare effectiveness and patient outcomes. This research delves into the potential of GPT-4, a large language model, to replicate AAVE in medical dialogues, with the aim of exploring its potential to address these communication barriers. We devised four prompt types: medical case-only prompts (BaseP), prompts containing demographic details (DemoP), prompts with AAVE-specific linguistic features (LingP), and prompts integrating DemoP and LingP (ComP). Through statistical analyses, including ANOVA and t-tests, applied to case simulations from the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE), we evaluated GPT-4's capacity to mirror AAVE linguistic attributes. The findings indicate that GPT-4 effectively emulated AAVE traits, with ComP producing the most AAVE linguistic features. Notably, DemoP elicited more phonological features than LingP, implying an intrinsic correlation between the African American demographic and specific linguistic markers in GPT-4. However, the model encountered challenges with certain AAVE constructs, such as question inversion and unique vocabulary. This study underscores GPT-4's potential to enhance culturally sensitive healthcare communication while emphasizing the necessity for further research to refine its precision in simulating diverse linguistic styles for practical medical training applications.",
