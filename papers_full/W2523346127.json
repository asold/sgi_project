    "abstract": "In this paper, our approach for building embedded applications is presented. The approach is based on the composition of reusable components with the addition of a contract principle for modelling non-functional constraints. Non-functional constraints are an important aspect of embedded systems, and are therefore modelled separately in contracts. As such, the component view presented here differs from traditional component based views, where focus is laid on the functional part. The ideas discussed in the paper have been implemented in a tool. This tool enables the construction of embedded software by means of components and contracts. Currently, the generation of runtime mechanisms - that enable runtime monitoring of the contracts - from the component model are being included.",
