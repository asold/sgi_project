    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Malaria remains a global health problem, with 247 million cases and 619,000 deaths in 2021. Diagnosis of Plasmodium species is important for administering the appropriate treatment. The gold-standard diagnosis for accurate species identification remains the thin blood smear. Nevertheless, this method is time-consuming and requires highly skilled and trained microscopists. To overcome these issues, new diagnostic tools based on deep learning are emerging. This study aimed to evaluate the performances of a real-time detection transformer (RT-DETR) object detection algorithm to discriminate Plasmodium species on thin blood smear images. The algorithm was trained and validated on a data set consisting in 24,720 images from 475 thin blood smears corresponding to 2,002,597 labels. Performances were calculated with a test data set of 4,508 images from 170 smears corresponding to 358,825 labels coming from six French university hospitals. At the patient level, the RT-DETR algorithm exhibited an overall accuracy of 79.4% (135/170) with a recall of 74% (40/54) and 81.9% (95/116) for negative and positive smears, respectively. Among Plasmodium- positive smears, the global accuracy was 82.7% (91/110) with a recall of 90% (38/42), 81.8% (18/22), and 76.1% (35/46) for P. falciparum , P. malariae, and P. ovale/vivax, respectively. The RT-DETR model achieved a World Health Organization (WHO) competence level 2 for species identification. Besides, the RT-DETR algorithm may be run in real-time on low-cost devices such as a smartphone and could be suitable for deployment in low-resource setting areas lacking microscopy experts.
