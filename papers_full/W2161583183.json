  "abstract": "In this paper, we present a language model based on clusters obtained by applying regular expressions to the training data and, thus, discriminating several different sentence types as, e.g. interrog- atives, imperatives or enumerations. The main motivation lies in the observation that different sentence types also underlie a different syntactic structure, and thus yield a varying distribution of n-grams reflect- ing their word order. We show that this assumption is valid by applying the models to English-Spanish bilingual corpora and obtaining good perplexity reductions of approximately 25%. In addition, we per- form an n-best rescoring experiment and show a relative improvement of 4-5% in word error rate. The models can be easily adapted to other translation tasks and do not need complicated training methods, thus being a valuable alternative for on-demand rescoring of sentence hypotheses such as they occur in the CAT framework.",
