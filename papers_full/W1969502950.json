Ressom*\nDepartment of Oncology, Georgetown University, Washington, DC, United States of America\nAbstract\nSearching metabolites against databases according to their masses is often the first step in metabolite identification for\na mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomics study. Major metabolite databases include Human Metabolome\nDataBase (HMDB), Madison Metabolomics Consortium Database (MMCD), Metlin, and LIPID MAPS. Since each one of these\ndatabases covers only a fraction of the metabolome, integration of the search results from these databases is expected to\nyield a more comprehensive coverage. However, the manual combination of multiple search results is generally difficult\nwhen identification of hundreds of metabolites is desired. We have implemented a web-based software tool that enables\nsimultaneous mass-based search against the four major databases, and the integration of the results. In addition, more\ncomplete chemical identifier information for the metabolites is retrieved by cross-referencing multiple databases. The\nsearch results are merged based on IUPAC International Chemical Identifier (InChI) keys. Besides a simple list of m/z values,\nthe software can accept the ion annotation information as input for enhanced metabolite identification. The performance of\nthe software is demonstrated on mass spectrometry data acquired in both positive and negative ionization modes.\nCompared with search results from individual databases, MetaboSearch provides better coverage of the metabolome and\nmore complete chemical identifier information.

At\npresent, metabolite identification is mainly achieved through mass-\nbased search followed by verification using authentic compounds.\nFirst, the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of a molecular ion of interest\nis searched against metabolite database(s). The molecules having\nmolecular weights within a specified tolerance to the query m/z\nvalue are retrieved from the databases as putative identifications.\nThen, authentic compounds of these putative identifications are\nsubjected to a tandem mass spectrometry experiment side-by-side\nwith the sample. By comparing the MS/MS spectra and retention\ntimes of the authentic compounds with the molecules of interest in\nthe sample, the identities of the molecules are confirmed.\nAlthough the mass-based search alone is inadequate to identify\na metabolite, it is an important step in the identification process\nsince it provides putative candidates for subsequent confirmation.\nMultiple metabolite databases have been assembled during the\npast years [1,2,3,4]. However, none of the existing databases\nguarantees a complete coverage of the metabolome. In addition,\ndata formats and retrieval methods are different among databases.\nAs a result, it is desirable to search against multiple databases to\nincrease the metabolome coverage. The search results from\nmultiple databases need to be combined into a non-redundant and\nuniform format for easy interpretation. Particularly, an efficient\nand automated computational solution is desired for the identi-\nfication of a large number of metabolites comparing with the\nmanual retrieval and combination from multiple databases.\nDue to the presence of multiple types of derived ions such as\nsodium/potassium adducts, isotopes, and in-source fragments, ion\nannotation is utilized to assist in metabolite identification [5]. For\nexample, the open source software CAMERA allows ion\nannotation based on the similarity between the extracted ion\nchromatograms of peaks from liquid chromatography-mass\nspectrometry (LC-MS) data and the m/z difference between these\npeaks [6]. A tool similar to CAMERA is described in [7]. Through\nion annotation, ions originating from the same compound can be\nrecognized and their adduct/isotope/in-source fragment forma-\ntions can be annotated. Appropriate accurate masses of these ions\nare calculated based on the annotation information, which in turn\nimproves the accuracy of mass-based search.\nIn this paper, we introduce a web-based software tool called\nMetaboSearch that can perform simultaneous search against four\nmetabolite databases: Human Metabolome DataBase (HMDB)\n[4], Madison Metabolomics Consortium Database (MMCD) [1],\nMetlin [2], and LIPID MAPS [3]. The search results are then\nintegrated into a non-redundant format. Various types of chemical\nidentifiers are provided by the software for effective reference of\nmetabolites, which consist of PubChem Compound ID (CID),\nPubChem Substance ID (SID), HMDB ID, KEGG ID, IUPAC\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 June 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 6 | e40096\nInternational Chemical Identifier (InChI) string, and InChI key. In\naddition to a simple list of m/z values, the output file from\nCAMERA can be uploaded into MetaboSearch, so that the ion\nannotation information on different product ion formations can be\nused for enhanced mass-based metabolite identification.\nMetaboSearch can be used to increase the coverage of\nmetabolome by leveraging the information from multiple\ndatabases. Previously, a similar database, MZedDB, was reported\nin [8]. However, three things distinguish MetaboSearch from\nMZedDB: (1) MetaboSearch directly retrieves the data from the\nonline databases at each time of mass-based identification. Thus\nthe results of MetaboSearch are derived from the most current\ninformation available at the databases, while MZedDB needs to\nupdate its database at the sever side every three months; (2)\nMetaboSearch is intended for batch search, where multiple m/z\nvalues can be directly uploaded and searched, while MZedDB\nneeds additional R-code for batch search of multiple m/z values of\ninterest; (3) whereas MZedDB considers different derived ions of\nmetabolites by allowing users to customize the adduct formations\nused, MetaboSearch can accept the ion annotation information\nfrom CAMERA to avoid guessing the possible adduct formations\nof an ion.\nMethods\nDesign\nMetaboSearch is designed to accept two types of inputs: a list of\nm/z values or m/z values along with annotation information from\nCAMERA. With both types of inputs, the putative identifications\nof each m/z value are retrieved according to the given mass\ntolerance. The databases from which the putative identifications\nare obtained can be selected by users tailoring to their specific\nneeds. For example, in human metabolomics research, the user\nhas the option to search in HMDB only, whose entries are known\nhuman metabolites. Alternatively, the user may choose to search\nin other databases besides HMDB, in which case more putative\nidentifications can be acquired but with the potential risk of getting\nidentifications from other organisms.\nWhen only a list of m/z values are provided for identification,\nevery m/z value is treated as a (de)protonated ion. First,\nmetabolites from each selected database are retrieved if their\nmasses fall within the mass tolerance range of the input m/z\nvalues. A list of chemical identifiers referring to these metabolites\nare acquired including PubChem CID, PubChem SID, KEGG\nID, HMDB ID, InChI string and InChI key. For databases which\nprovide only limited chemical identifier information, the missing\nidentifiers are filled by cross referencing from other databases. For\nexample, in Metlin, neither InChI string nor InChI key is\nprovided. In addition, a large fraction of PubChem CID\ninformation is missing. MetaboSearch fills out these missing\nidentifiers by retrieving the missing information from available\nhyperlinks directing to LIPID MAPS, KEGG or HMDB database.\nFinally, the search results from individual database are merged\nthrough InChI keys. The InChI key is a hashed version of InChI\nstring which describes the atoms and bond connectivity in-\nformation, tautomeric information, isotope information, stereo-\nchemistry information, and electronic charge information of\na molecule. It has been previously demonstrated that InChI and\nInChI key provide the best way to describe chemical compounds\nthrough structure codes [9]. InChI key generally consists of 25\ncharacters, where the first 14 characters contain the connectivity\ninformation of a molecule. Since the stereochemistry is generally\nless a concern in the initial identification of a metabolite, and the\nstereochemistry information from database is sometimes incom-\nplete or missing, we choose to merge the stereoisomers into the\nsame entry in the final search results. By combining compounds\nhaving identical first 14 characters of InChI keys, the same\nmetabolites and stereoisomers are merged while structural isomers\nare kept as different metabolites. The possible number of\nstereoisomers is presented in the search results by counting the\nInChI keys with the same first 14 characters but different\nremaining characters. The flowchart of mass-based search and\nresults integration is shown in Figure 1 as the computation module\nof the software.\nWhen the output annotation file from CAMERA is imported\ninto the software, the annotation file is first parsed to group ions\noriginating from the same metabolite together. If conflicting\nannotation is encountered with an ion having multiple possible\nannotations, the ion is included in multiple annotation groups and\nidentified separately. After parsing, the monoisotopic protonated\n(or deprotonated in negative ionization mode) m/z of each\nannotation group is calculated. These m/z values are then used to\nsearch against databases, as these m/z values are directly acquired\nfrom a list of m/z values only, which is described in the previous\nparagraph. Following the mass-based identification, the search\nresults are combined so that the ion with multiple annotations is\nrepresented as a single ion with putative identifications from\nmultiple annotation groups.\nImplementation\nTwo techniques can be used to integrate information from\nmultiple databases: a data warehouse or web-based techniques. A\ndata warehouse has a backend database combines the data from\nthe different sources, and provides a unified, reconciled view of\narchitected data environment that serves as the single integrated\nsource of data for information storage and retrieval. Compared\nwith data warehouse, web based techniques require no local\nstorage or management while are able to synchronize the results\nwith their source databases. Since the knowledge base of\nmetabolites is in constant expansion, web based implementation\nis used for MetaboSearch. Java language is often adopted for web\napplication due to its outstanding performance across platforms.\nMetaboSearch is implemented using Java and C coupled with web\nspidering and PHP techniques. The architecture of the software is\ncomposed of two parts: a Java engine and a Web engine, as shown\nin Figure 2. The function of each engine is described below.\nJava engine is responsible for importing data, database search,\nand exporting results. The computation module depicted in\nFigure 1 is the major module within the Java engine. In the\ncomputation module, each database is searched respectively\nthrough a sub-module. The retrieval results are dynamically\nfetched from online databases through web spidering. For HMDB,\nMMCD and Metlin, the batch query function from these\ndatabases is used. The webpage data of the metabolites are\nanalyzed for information extraction and cross referencing. For\nLIPID MAPS, open source software GNU Wget is used to query\nthe database. Wget iterates over the m/z value list. For each m/z\nvalue subjected to search, metabolite information is downloaded to\na local file. Then, the file is parsed to extract the relevant\ninformation. Finally, the metabolite lists from multiple databases\nare integrated to remove the redundant metabolites.\nThe web engine focuses on parsing the ion annotation\ninformation from the input file. The input file is first stored in\na temporary storage space on the server after it is imported. Then\na shell script calls a Matlab application to parse the file and\ncalculate the monoisotopic (de)protonated m/z values of each\npeak. During the execution of the web engine, the Java engine\nconstantly queries the status of the web engine. Once the\nMetaboSearch: Tool for Metabolite Identification\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 June 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 6 | e40096\nFigure 1.

The Java engine then conducts the mass-\nbased search for metabolites, but using the calculated mono-\nisotopic (de)protonated m/z values from the web engine. Besides\nthe integration of the database retrieval results, the Java engine is\nresponsible to put the previously split ions (due to conflicting ion\nannotation) back into a single ion and combine their putative\nidentifications.\nFigure 2.

There are four tabbed panels in the software.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0040096.g003\nMetaboSearch: Tool for Metabolite Identification\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 June 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 6 | e40096\nTo reduce the usage of internet bandwidth and computation\nload of the web server, MetaboSearch uses the Java Web Start\ntechnique, which enables most of the computational task to be\nexecuted locally on the users’ machines. Java Web Start resorts to\nJava Network Launching Protocol (JNLP), so that the web browser\ncan automatically download, cache and run Java software. Since\nJNLP is cross-platform, MetaboSearch can be run under\nWindows, Linux or Mac platform.\nSoftware Interface\nMetaboSearch has four tabbed panels as shown in Figure 3.\nPanel 1 enables the user to select databases to search against. Panel\n2 is used to import data, set the ionization mode of data and the\nmass tolerance for the search. The input data can be either directly\npasted on the panel (for m/z values only) or be imported from an\nExcel (.xls) file (for both m/z values and CAMERA output files).\nPanel 3 displays the search results from individual databases. The\nbottom ‘‘Export to Local’’ button outputs the integrated results in\nExcel (.xls) format. Panel 4 shows the program running status and\nprogress.\nResults and Discussion\nTwo datasets (Dataset 1 and Dataset 2) were analyzed to\nshowcase the efficacy of MetaboSearch in mass-based metabolite\nidentification. The datasets were acquired by analyzing human\nserum samples through an ultra performance liquid chromatog-\nraphy coupled with a hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass\nspectrometer (UPLC-QTOF MS) and by preprocessing the raw\nLC-MS data using the XCMS software [10]. Dataset 1 was first\nanalyzed by CAMERA for ion annotation. Then the output was\nsubjected to mass-based search to acquire putative identifications.\nDataset 2 consists of a list of m/z values that was directly imported\ninto MetaboSearch to acquire putative identifications.\nIn Dataset 1, 724 peaks previously acquired in the positive\nmode were annotated by CAMERA for four types of adducts\n([M+H]\n+,[ M+Na]+,[ M+K]+,[ M+H-H2O]+), isotopes up to 4th\norder and doubly charged ions. After importing into Metabo-\nSearch, the peaks were assigned to 497 annotation groups. The\nm/z values of these annotation groups were then used for mass-\nbased identification with a 10 ppm (parts-per-million) mass\ntolerance. If no ion annotation information is used during the\ndatabase search, all peaks would be assumed to be monoisotopic,\nprotonated ions. Out of 724 peaks, only 280 peaks would have at\nleast one putative identification compared with the 331 peaks\nhaving at least one putative identification when ion annotation is\nused.\nIn Dataset 2, a list of 423 m/z peaks previously acquired in the\nnegative mode was fed to MetaboSearch for putative identifica-\ntions. In this analysis, no annotation information associated with\nthe list was used. Therefore, all peaks were assumed to be\nmonoisotopic deprotonated ions. An m/z tolerance of 10 ppm was\nused.\nTable 1 summarizes the putative identification results obtained\nfor Dataset 1 and Dataset 2. As shown in the table, MetaboSearch\nretrieves more putative identifications than any single metabolite\ndatabase. This is expected as MetaboSearch combines the output\nfrom individual databases. It should be noted that there is no\nguarantee that the gained metabolites are correct identifications.\nAs outlined in [11], at least two independent and orthogonal data\n(retention time and mass spectrum, accurate mass and tandem\nmass spectrum, etc.) relative to an authentic compound analyzed\nunder identical experimental conditions are necessary to verify\na putative metabolite identification. However, MetaboSearch\nprovides a large candidate identification pool for MS-based\nmetabolomics studies, which reduces the possibility that a correct\nidentification is missed at an early stage from further verification\ndue to database limitations. Incorrect putative identifications can\nbe ruled out at a later stage through retention times or tandem\nmass spectra. On the other hand, if a correct putative identifica-\ntion is missed during the mass-based search, it will be much harder\nto recover it during the metabolite verification. MetaboSearch also\noffers information about the database from which a particular\nputative identification is from. This information may also help\nusers to prioritize the putative identifications as users may have\nparticular preference/confidence on some databases while other\ndatabases can be used as reference when the preferred databases\ndo not give satisfactory results.\nIn addition to a more complete coverage of possible metabolites,\nMetaboSearch also provides more comprehensive information\nconcerning chemical identifiers which are used to refer to a specific\nmetabolite. An example is shown in Table 2, where a negative ion\n[M-H]\n- with m/z value 624.3401 was subjected to mass-based\nidentification. Although the ion can be found in all four databases,\nMetaboSearch provides the most comprehensive chemical iden-\ntifier information about this metabolite.\nMetaboSearch took about 3 hours to acquire putative\nidentifications for Dataset 1 and about 3.5 hours for Dataset 2,\non a PC with Quad 2.83 GHz CPU and 8 GB memory running\na Windows XP 64-bit operating system. The running time\ngenerally depends on the number of peaks/metabolites to be\nidentified and the network condition while searching. Considering\nthe difficulty and the required effort to search and integrate\nputative identifications manually, we believe this running time is\nacceptable, especially when the identification of hundreds to a few\nthousand ions is desired.\nAvailability and Future Directions\nAs a web-based software tool, MetaboSearch is developed to\nsearch multiple metabolite databases simultaneously according to\nthe m/z values of observed peaks and output of CAMERA. The\nsearch results from individual databases are combined through\nInChI keys. More complete chemical identifier information is\nprovided by cross-referencing. Annotation information from\nCAMERA can be incorporated for enhanced metabolite identi-\nfication. MetaboSearch is shown to provide a more comprehensive\nlist of putative identification and better identification coverage of\nobserved peaks in a LC-MS-based metabolomics study. The\nsoftware and the datasets presented in this manuscript are\navailable at http://omics.georgetown.edu/MetaboSearch.html.\nFurther expansions of MetaboSearch include adapting the\nsoftware to more flexible ion annotation file format (for example,\nthe file format used in [7]). More databases can be added to the\nsoftware to expand the knowledge-base for mass-based metabolite\nsearch.
