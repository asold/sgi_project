    "abstract": "Abstract The issue in question relates to machine building, particularly to machining of metals. We used the approach and software environment allow comparison with other aforementioned approaches and software environments to more accurately simulate the stress state of the material of the tool and, thereby, to increase accuracy of the design parameters of the tool for specific operating conditions. Introduction of automated systems of metals is directly related to the device status monitoring process of metal cutting, work process and increase its efficiency in the conditions of limited use of staff. Tasks of further improvement of machine-building production are inextricably linked with the effective use of technological equipment. Improving the efficiency of CNC machine tools is limited “hard” daemon setting the specified modes of the metals, when not taken into account peculiarities of processing of a concrete detail and lays the modes for the most demanding conditions.",
