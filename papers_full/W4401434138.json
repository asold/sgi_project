    "abstract": "Introduction In recent years, numerous AI tools have been employed to equip learners with diverse technical skills such as coding, data analysis, and other competencies related to computational sciences. However, the desired outcomes have not been consistently achieved. This study aims to analyze the perspectives of students and professionals from non-computational fields on the use of generative AI tools, augmented with visualization support, to tackle data analytics projects. The focus is on promoting the development of coding skills and fostering a deep understanding of the solutions generated. Consequently, our research seeks to introduce innovative approaches for incorporating visualization and generative AI tools into educational practices. Methods This article examines how learners perform and their perspectives when using traditional tools vs. LLM-based tools to acquire data analytics skills. To explore this, we conducted a case study with a cohort of 59 participants among students and professionals without computational thinking skills. These participants developed a data analytics project in the context of a Data Analytics short session. Our case study focused on examining the participants' performance using traditional programming tools, ChatGPT, and LIDA with GPT as an advanced generative AI tool. Results The results shown the transformative potential of approaches based on integrating advanced generative AI tools like GPT with specialized frameworks such as LIDA. The higher levels of participant preference indicate the superiority of these approaches over traditional development methods. Additionally, our findings suggest that the learning curves for the different approaches vary significantly. Since learners encountered technical difficulties in developing the project and interpreting the results. Our findings suggest that the integration of LIDA with GPT can significantly enhance the learning of advanced skills, especially those related to data analytics. We aim to establish this study as a foundation for the methodical adoption of generative AI tools in educational settings, paving the way for more effective and comprehensive training in these critical areas. Discussion It is important to highlight that when using general-purpose generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, users must be aware of the data analytics process and take responsibility for filtering out potential errors or incompleteness in the requirements of a data analytics project. These deficiencies can be mitigated by using more advanced tools specialized in supporting data analytics tasks, such as LIDA with GPT. However, users still need advanced programming knowledge to properly configure this connection via API. There is a significant opportunity for generative AI tools to improve their performance, providing accurate, complete, and convincing results for data analytics projects, thereby increasing user confidence in adopting these technologies. We hope this work underscores the opportunities and needs for integrating advanced LLMs into educational practices, particularly in developing computational thinking skills.",
