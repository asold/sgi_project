    "abstract": "The paper is based on the experimental investigation of accelerated stresses on insulation of power transformer.The effects of individual thermal and electrical stresses have been graphically presented.The factors accelerated thermal aging factor (ATAF) and accelerated electrical aging factor (AEAF) have been introduced, it helps to understand the contribution of thermal and electrical stresses and degradation trends of insulating properties.The accelerated aging factors have been mathematically correlated with different properties of insulation such as moisture, breakdown voltage (BDV), tan delta and resistivity.These parameters were determined experimentally for fresh oil samples and for samples subjected to accelerated aging.",
