L2 grit and foreign language enjoyment (FLE) are a mong such variables. Grit refers to\nindividuals’ tendency to express perseverance and passion for l ong-term goals ( Duckworth et al.,\n2007) while FLE pertains to the degree of perceiving L2 learning plea sant in class by students\n(Dewaele and MacIntyre, 2014 ).\nIn the light of dynamic systems in classroom learning, sever al factors may interact to aﬀect FLE\nsuch as classroom environment ( Dewaele and MacIntyre, 2014; Dewaele et al., 2018; Elahi Shir van\nand Taherian, 2020) as well as teacher and learner variables ( Dewaele and MacIntyre, 2014; Dewaele\net al., 2018, 2019a; Jiang and Dewaele, 2019; Elahi Shirvan et a l., 2020 ). The existing literature has\nalso introduced grit as a predicting factor for educational s uccess (Datu et al., 2017 ), which can be\nElahi Shirvan et al. Foreign Language Enjoyment and L2 Grit\nrelated to positive emotions ( Datu et al., 2016, 2018 ), well-\nbeing criteria such as life satisfaction ( Datu et al., 2016; Vainio\nand Daukantaite, 2016 ), and mental well-being ( Vainio and\nDaukantaite, 2016 ). In fact, these previous studies indicated that\ngrit can predict optimal emotions which can provide insights in to\nthe association between L2 grit and FLE. More speciﬁcally, it h as\nbeen argued that there are more chances that grittier indivi duals\nmake positive attributions, have a more positive growth minds et\nwhich in turn results in developing further positive emotions\n(\nDuckworth et al., 2009; Hill et al., 2016 ).\nGiven the plausible association between L2 grit and FLE as\ntwo PP variables in SLA, the longitudinal dynamic associati on,\nconsistent with the CDST line of research, between these two\nvariables has not been investigated yet.\nWei et al. (2019)\ncontended that when individual diﬀerence (ID) variables are\nused alongside each other, they may grow together and have\nmediating eﬀects on one another, and by doing so, they can\naﬀect the quality of language learning. Furthermore, regard ing\nthe rational underlying the longitudinal examination of th e\ncovariance between L2 grit and FLE as two individual diﬀerenc e\n(ID) variables, it should be noted that (\nDörnyei and Ryan, 2015 ,\np. 6) raised serious issues concerning the classic four assum ptions\nof IDs, one of which is that (b) “IDs are relatively stable.”\nThey contended that “when we look more closely, individual\nlearner characteristics are not stable but show salient tem poral\nvariation. . . .” (p. 6). Quite similar to this argument,\nEllis and\nLarsen-Freeman (2006, p. 563) maintained that “To attribute\ncausality to any one variable (or even a constellation of vari ables)\nwithout taking time into account is misguided.”\nDörnyei and Ryan (2015) also maintained that:\nReframing individual diﬀerences as complex dynamic systems\nhas the potential to mitigate many of the failings associated\nwith the classic ID conceptualization. . . . . . . Arguably the most\nsigniﬁcant contribution of a complex dynamic systems approach\nis in its role as an overriding guiding principle that positions\nchange rather than stability as the norm, moving us away from\nstatic conceptualizations of learners toward embracing notions of\nchange and growth (p. 6)\nGiven the above explanations, examining the longitudinal\ninterplay between the L2 grit and FLE can provide us with\ndeeper conceptualization of their temporal covariance as well as\nthe occasional change and stability of these variables whic h is\nnot taken into account in single-shot data collection (\nLarsen-\nFreeman, 2016 ). Therefore, there is a need for CDST compatible\nmodels (see Hiver and Al-Hoorie, 2019; Hiver et al., in press )\nto take into account the interactive eﬀects of these variable s\nover time. To access more accurate and detailed information\nabout the relative changes between L2 grit and FLE over time, in\nthis study we used a longitudinal growth curve model (LGCM).\nThe ﬂexibility of a LGCM shifts the focus toward within-\nindividual changes and more accurate and precise interpretat ions\nconcerning the association between L2 grit and FLE.\nVia the use of LGCM as CDS compatible method, we followed\nthree main objectives in the present research. First, we inte nded\nto describe the change in grit and FLE through time for the\npresent participants. Conceptually, this was achieved by formi ng\na regression line (a growth curve) plotting both variables ov er\ntime for all participants of the study. Second, we aimed to achi eve\nan average intercept, as initial level, as well as an average sl ope,\nas rate of change, for all individuals of the study for two lat ent\nvariables of FLE and L2 grit. Finally, we examined the covari ance\nbetween two latent variables of L2 grit and FLE to understand the\nco-development of these two variables over time.\nREVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE\nInspired by\nFredrickson’s (2001) broaden-and-build theory,\nMacIntyre and Gregerse (2012) introduced PP in SLA. They\ncontended that positive aﬀective factors can help language\nlearners with absorbing further language input (\nDewaele et al.,\n2019b). Under the inﬂuence of Pekrun’s control-value theory\nof achievement emotion ( Pekrun, 2006 ) as a second inspiring\ntheory for researching emotions in SLA, positive emotions lik e\nenjoyment are seen emerging from the learning activities. Li\n(2021) maintained that the two inﬂuential theories of pp in SLA,\nnamely, Fredrickson (2001) and Pekrun (2006) acknowledge\nthe pivotal role of positive emotions in students’ well-being\nand performance.\nFOREIGN LANGUAGE ENJOYMENT\nApart from anxiety, little attention was paid to other emotion s\nin second language acquisition (SLA) until 2012. However, t he\nemergence of PP shifted the focus from anxiety to more divers e\nL2 learning emotions. Therefore, three phases of emotions ha ve\nbeen introduced in the ﬁeld of SLA, moving from the “Emotion\nAvoidance Phase” to “Anxiety-Prevailing Phase” to a ﬁnal pha se\ncalled “Positive and Negative Emotions Phase” which as its n ame\nimplies incorporates positive and negative emotions both and\ntheir complex dynamic interaction (\nDewaele and Chengchen,\n2020). This third phase was inﬂuenced by the introduction of PP\nin SLA in 2010 ( MacIntyre and Gregerse, 2012 ).\nPositive psychologists do not deny the existence or impact\nof negative emotions ( Dewaele and Li, 2018 ) but rather\nthan focusing on deﬁning problems and overcoming learner\ndeﬁciencies, they attempt to enhance the positive emotion\nby encouraging greater engagement as well as increasing the\nappreciation of meaning in life and its activities (\nMacIntyre\nand Mercer, 2014 ). This new perspective has been particularly\nwelcomed in SLA as the long-standing great focus on what\nhas wrongly led to the relative neglect of the eﬀect of\npositive emotions on language learning for years (\nDewaele and\nMacIntyre, 2014, 2016, 2019; Dewaele and Dewaele, 2017 ).\nOne major PP theory is the Broaden-and-Build theory\n(Fredrickson, 2001 ). In terms of the Broaden-and-Build Theory\n(Fredrickson, 1998, 2013 ), positive emotions help to expand a\nlearner’s thought-action repertoire and form the psychologi cal,\nphysical, intellectual, and social resources necessary for his/her\npresent and prospective development. Therefore, expressing\npositive emotions in learning a foreign language can enhance a\nlearner’s consciousness of language input as well as perceptions of\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 2 August 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 720326\nElahi Shirvan et al. Foreign Language Enjoyment and L2 Grit\nlinguistic features, and can increase their application of di ﬀerent\nproblem-solving techniques ( Piechurska-Kuciel, 2017; Boudreau\net al., 2018 ), which lead to an expansion of the students’ foreign\nlanguage knowledge-base. In addition, positive emotions ca n\nmoderate the inﬂuence of negative emotions associated with\nissues of learning foreign languages, enhance resilience f rom\ndiﬃculties, and form social links in class by creating activ e\napproaches to both teachers and peers (\nDewaele and Alfawzan,\n2018), which points to the additional value of the turn in SLA\ndomain to positive emotions.\nOne positive emotion worth investigation is FLE. So far, late nt\nfactors of FLE ( Dewaele and MacIntyre, 2016; Li et al., 2018 ) as\nwell as its antecedents and outcomes ( Dewaele and Alfawzan,\n2018) and its association with language anxiety ( Dewaele and\nMacIntyre, 2014, 2016; Elahi Shirvan and Taherian, 2021 ) have\nbeen explored. Dewaele and MacIntyre (2014) introduced a\nFLE scale with 21 items that deal with positive emotions about\nthe learning process, peers and teacher. Overall, they found\na small negative association ( r = − 0.34) between FLE and\nforeign language classroom anxiety (FLCA) among 1,740 fore ign\nlanguage students from all over the world. Such results sugg est\nthat the two emotions are not in a strong see-saw association ,\nbut appear to operate as two diﬀerent but correlated dimensions\nof experience. Further quantitative analysis revealed that higher\nFLE and lower FLCA were associated with age, a high level\nof multilingualism, mastery in the FL, matching the perceive d\ncompetence of peers in the FL class, and being in university rat her\nthan secondary school settings (\nDewaele and MacIntyre, 2014 ).\nWith a focus on continuous system change and\ninterconnectedness, several studies have shown that FLE is\ncomplex, dynamic, and multifaceted (\nDewaele and Dewaele,\n2017; Elahi Shirvan and Talebzadeh, 2018b; Pavelescu and Pe tri´c,\n2018; Elahi Shirvan et al., 2020; Elahi Shirvan and Taherian ,\n2021). Following this dynamic perspective, some studies have\ninvestigated FLE from a person-centered approach, called\nidiographic approach (\nElahi Shirvan and Talebzadeh, 2018a;\nElahi Shirvan and Taherian, 2020; Elahi Shirvan et al., 2020 )\nand from a variable-centered approach, also called nomotheti c\nperspective ( Dewaele and Dewaele, 2017; De Ruiter et al., 2019 )\nwhile some used a mixed methods approach ( Dewaele and\nMacIntyre, 2019).\nAs the ﬁrst attempt to investigate dynamics of FLE from a\nnomothetic perspective, Dewaele and Dewaele’s (2017) pseudo-\nlongitudinal study explored the FLE changes through time,\nfollowing a dynamic approach. They compared three groups\nof students categorized in terms of age and observed a\nmoderate increase in FLE through time. An additional regres sion\nanalysis showed that fewer learner-internal and teacher-c entered\nvariables managed to predict FLE at both the end and the\nbeginning of secondary education vs. the middle part. These\nﬁndings suggested that sources of FLE were dynamic and\nchangeable between the age of 12 and 18.\nAcknowledging the dynamic nature of emotions,\nDe Ruiter\net al. (2019) investigated intra-individual dynamics of FLE\nthat are embedded in the growing context of classroom.\nUsing the technique of Kohonen’s Self-Organizing Maps\n(SOM), they aimed to explore the intra-individual process of\nFLE and FLA along teachers’ emotional support during the\ninteractions between a teacher and his students in terms of\ntwo dyadic interactions. The results showed the emergence o f\nrepeated patterns of teacher support, student enjoyment and\nanxiety during these interactions which highlighted the se lf-\norganizing quality of these student-teacher dyadic interac tions,\nthe bidirectional form of this process, and, generally, the\nconception of students and teachers as dynamic systems. Besid es,\nthe particular quality of the emergent patterns shows that the\nconventional positive relationship between teacher support a nd\nstudent emotion might be generalized to processes of real-li fe.\nIn a recent study,\nElahi Shirvan et al. (2020) used a time-based\nsampling design of ecological momentary assessment in order\nto explore the dynamism of multiple aspects of FLE indiﬀerent\ntime scales in an intermediate EFL course. Applying open ended\ninterviews during months, journals during the weeks, enjoy\nmeters within minutes as well as the idio dynamic approach\nwithin seconds, their ﬁndings showed that enjoyment in fore ign\nlanguage changes in terms of a hierarchy of timescales, from\nmoment-to-moment shifts to those from month to month.\nAdditionally,\nDewaele and Dewaele (2020) explored the extent\nto which FLE varies at a unique point of time in the presence\nof two diﬀerent teachers for a single FL. Their participants wer e\na subgroup of 40 students with one primary teacher and a\nsecondary teacher for the same foreign language. Their ﬁndi ngs\nrevealed that the participants reported remarkable higher FLE\nwith the primary teacher. They discussed their ﬁndings in\nassociation with signiﬁcantly more positive perceptions of the\nprimary teacher and his frequent application of the foreign\nlanguage in class.\nAs an innovative method compatible with CDST (see\nHiver\nand Al-Hoorie, 2019 ), application of LGCM for investigating\nFLE has been recently used by Elahi Shirvan and Taherian\n(2020). They employed a LGCM method to trace the growth in\n367 undergraduates’ FLE along a semester in a general English\ncourse. This study revealed that although their participants ’ FLE\nincreased dramatically throughout the semester, the signi ﬁcance\nof the intercept and slope variances for FLE pointed to their\nheterogeneity in FLE along the research time. In addition,\nthe initial level of FLE did not show to predict its growth\nalong the course. Also, very recently,\nPan and Zhang (2021) ,\nvia a longitudinal study, explored the ﬂuctuations of FLE in\nduring a 14-week period and their association with learners’\nmotivation and personality traits. They found FLE quite\ndynamic over time under the inﬂuence of both motivational\n(ideal L2 self, ought-to self) and personality trait factors such\nas extroversion.\nL2 GRIT\nGrit, a recently-introduced personality trait which is a positi ve,\nnon-cognitive skill, is shown to be promising in life success\nas well as academic success (\nMcCain, 2017 ). It has been\ndeﬁned along two dimensions of perseverance of eﬀort\n(PE) and consistency of interest (CI) (\nDuckworth et al.,\n2007). Both dimensions of grit contribute signiﬁcantly to\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 3 August 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 720326\nElahi Shirvan et al. Foreign Language Enjoyment and L2 Grit\nsuccess as perseverance of eﬀort facilitates the achievement\nof mastery in spite of failure and consistency of interest is\na key to deliberate practice to gain mastery (\nCredé et al.,\n2016).\nMany investigations have attempted to reveal how grit\nrelates to academic and non-academic achievement. These\ninvestigations revealed that grit is positively correlated with non-\nacademic outcomes including retention in military programs as\nwell as achievement in the National Spelling Bee competition\n(e.g.,\nDuckworth et al., 2007; Duckworth and Quinn, 2009;\nEskreis-Winkler et al., 2014 ) and retention in career and married\nlife ( Eskreis-Winkler et al., 2014 ). Besides, grit has shown\nto be positively associated with academic achievement and\ncertain constructs including classroom management (\nBanse and\nPalacios, 2018), teacher’s support (Keegan, 2017; Lee and Drajati,\n2019; Lee and Hsieh, 2019; Lee, 2020; Yoon et al., 2020 ), academic\nachievement ( Akos and Kretchmar, 2017 ), self-eﬃcacy ( Usher\net al., 2019 ), engagement ( Von Culin et al., 2014; Wolters and\nHussain, 2015; Aparicio et al., 2017; Hodge et al., 2017; Fosn acht\net al., 2018; Wei et al., 2019 ), education motivation ( Piña-Watson\net al., 2015 ), and achievement goals ( Chen et al., 2018 ).\nIn the SLA domain, the early works of research used\nthe general grit scale to measure language learners’ grit. T o\nbegin with, Lake (2013) investigated the correlation between\ngrit and a number of PP variables. He surveyed 800 female\nJapanese university students who learned English language via\na new edition of\nDuckworth et al.’s (2007) general scale and\nshowed that grittier students enjoyed a stronger interest i n\nspending time and putting eﬀorts in L2 learning. Changlek and\nPalanukulwong (2015) recruited 183 Thai students to explore\ngritty students’ motivational features. They found that hi gh-\nachievers were grittier and grit was positively associated w ith\nstudents’ motivation and negatively with anxiety.\nIn a similar vein, Wei et al. (2019) observed a positive\nlow association between grit and English language scores of\n832 secondary school students in China.\nYamashita (2018)\nestimated no correlation between 78 Japanese learners’ grit and\nGPA. Interestingly, the PE dimension of grit showed a negati ve\ncorrelation with GPA for a sub-sample of the population. It is\nnoteworthy that these studies all employed the general grit s cales\nintroduced by Duckworth and colleagues (\nDuckworth et al.,\n2007; Duckworth and Quinn, 2009 ) and assessed learners’ grit\nglobally and not locally and not embedded in the context of\nL2 learning.\nThese inconclusive results raise the point that an L2-speciﬁc\ngrit scale was needed to act as a more accurate measurement of\nachievement in an L2 setting (\nSudina et al., 2020 ). Consequently,\nTeimouri et al. (2020) constructed the L2 grit scale to assess the\ndomain-speciﬁc grit in SLA. These results based on a sample of\n191 EFL learners, showed higher correlations between the L2 -grit\nscale and L2 learners’ outcome than the Grit–O, as evidenced by\nlarge attenuation-corrected correlations for the L2 grit.\nWhat is common among the existing literature is that the L2\ngrit works of research are not only limited in size, but they h ave\nscarcely addressed its dynamic nature and its relationship with\nother emotions experienced in the context of SLA.\nL2 GRIT AND L2 EMOTIONS\nAs mentioned before,\nTeimouri et al. (2020) constructed a\ndomain-speciﬁc grit scale to measure learners’ passion and\nperseverance in learning a second language. These researche rs\nexplored how the general grit scale and the domain-speciﬁc\ngrit scale dealt with various emotional, motivational, and\nlanguage-related eﬀects. Their results revealed a positive\ncorrelation between L2-speciﬁc grit and enjoyment, attenti on,\nintended eﬀort, growth mindset, willingness to communicate ,\nand other language achievement measures. Besides, a negati ve\ncorrelation was found with language anxiety. In this resear ch,\nthe correlations between L2-speciﬁc grit and L2 achievement\nvariables were negligible. Also, only PE showed to be correla ted\nwith L2 outcome measures for both L2 speciﬁc and general grit.\nLee (2020) looked into the role of classroom enjoyment and\ngrit in L2 willingness to communicate in primary school, high\nschool, and university students. The results showed that bo th\nvariables were signiﬁcant positive antecedents of L2 willing ness\nto communicate in the three groups. Recently,\nFeng and Papi\n(2020) reported that perseverance of eﬀort (POE), and not\nconsistency of interest (COI), should be regarded as a positiv e\npredictor of L2 persistence. Finally, Wei et al. (2019) observed\nthat grit is associated with foreign language performance ov ertly\nand covertly via foreign language enjoyment. They also found\na mediating role of enjoyment on grit. They concluded that\nthose who are grittier have better performances and exhibit b etter\nself-reactions and positive emotions including FLE. Moreove r,\nclassroom environment aﬀected the correlation of grit and\nenjoyment in such a way that in a positive environment,\nstudents increased their eﬀort and by doing so enjoyed the\nlearning. Despite the recent interest in the exploration of L2\ngrit and emotions, especially positive ones, in SLA, the dynamic\ninteraction of L2 grit and positive emotions like FLE still need s to\nbe explored from a longitudinal perspective via the use of suitable\nmethods. One of the methods is LGCM.\nLGCM\nResearchers in a variety of disciplines have used LGCM\nin a structural equation modeling (SEM) framework to\ndescribe and analyze changes in individual’s attributes, in cluding\npersonal characteristics, behaviors, and education outcom es over\ntime. LGCM addresses important methodological concerns for\nanalyzing panel data over the traditional regression methods\nand mean comparisons. Firstly, the dynamic quality of these\nmodels views the repeated measure as a process that unfolds\nover time not as a status at two distinct time points (\nCoyne\nand Downey, 1991 ). Secondly, when an individual change has a\nnon-linear trajectory, LGCM techniques are appropriate to show\ncomplexities of such change (\nWillett and Sayer, 1994 ). Thirdly,\nconcerning the growing quality of the change process, LGCM\ntechniques provide empirical researchers with a richer and wi der\nrange of research questions; those dealing with the nature o f\nindividual development (\nWillett, 1988 ). Fourthly, such analysis\nprovides a thorough understanding of the dynamic associatio n\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 4 August 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 720326\nElahi Shirvan et al. Foreign Language Enjoyment and L2 Grit\nbetween diﬀerent time-dependent cognitive and non-cognitiv e\nfactors than conventional analytical methods.\nConsidering the recent research on the dynamics of emotions\nin SLA (e.g., Gkonou et al., 2017; Boudreau et al., 2018 ), and\nthe link between positive emotions and grit ( Datu et al., 2018 ),\nit can be hypothesized that L2 learners’ growth in their L2 gri t\ncan be inﬂuenced by a change in their level of FLE during a\nforeign language course. Using a LGCM, we ﬁrstly aimed to trace\nthe variations of two time-varying non-cognitive factors, FLE\nand L2 grit through time for each subject in the study. As a\nsecond objective, the current study aimed at obtaining an av erage\nintercept, or initial level, as well as an average slope, or the rate\nof change, for all individuals, each with its own variance fo r\ntwo latent variables of FLE and L2 grit. Finally, we analyzed t he\ndynamic association or covariance between FLE and L2 grit to\nexplore the co-development of these two variables over time.\nTherefore, the present research was conducted to answer the\nfollowing questions:\n• In what direction and to what extent do English as a\nforeign language learners’ FLE and L2 grit change throughou t\nthe semester?\n• Do the initial levels of FLE and L2 grit predict their rate\nof change?\n• Is change over time in FLE related to change over time in\nL2 grit?\nParticipants and Setting\nThe target population was a sample of 437 English as a foreign\nlanguage (EFL)learners (278 females and 159 males) which we re\nselected from private language institutes of three big citie s\nin Iran. Their level of language proﬁciency ranged between\nlower-intermediate to upper-intermediate, according to Oxf ord\nPlacement Test, and their age ranged from 17 to 34 years. All\nparticipants’ ﬁrst language was Persian. They learned Englis h as a\nforeign language (EFL). The data collection occurred in sum mer\n2020. During this period all the English language courses wer e\nheld in-person.\nInstrumentation\nFLE Scale\nTo measure L2 learners’ FLE, we used the Persian version of\nthe original 21-itemscale of FLE (\nDewaele and MacIntyre, 2014 )\ndeveloped by Elahi Shirvan et al. (2021) . The items of the scale\nreﬂected the social dimension of FLE with 9 items (e.g., “We\nform a tight group, ” “There is a good atmosphere”) and the\nprivate dimension of FLE in class with 12 items (e.g., “I enjoy\nit”, “I’m a worthy member of the English class”). Answers to t he\nstatements were provided on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = strongly\ndisagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = undecided, 4 = agree, 5 = strongly\nagree) for the L2 classes. All items were positive statements .\nThe internal consistency of the original scale, as reported b y\nDewaele and MacIntyre (2014) , estimated via Cronbach’s alpha,\nwas interpreted as high ( r = 0.86). A one-sample Kolmogorov-\nSmirnov test attested to the normality of distribution (z =\n2.01, p = 0.09). Also, Resnik and Dewaele (2020) analyzed and\nreported the internal consistency of original FLE scale as hi gh\n(Cronbach’s alpha= 0.843, N = 12). To measure the reliability\nof the Persian version of FLE scale, Elahi Shirvan et al. (2021) ran\nCronbach’sα to examine its internal consistency and McDonald’s\nω (McDonald, 1985, 1999 ) to test the composite reliability, which\nwere reported to be 0.88 and 0.89, respectively. The longitudi nal\nconﬁrmatory factor analysis of the scale was also supported by\nElahi Shirvan et al. (2021) with partial strong invariance.\nL2 Grit Scale\nTo measure L2 grit, we used the scale developed by\nTeimouri\net al. (2020) with two interrelated sub-constructs: consistency\nof interest and perseverance of eﬀorts in learning a language.\nThe former assesses the changes of students’ interest durin g L2\nlearning and the latter measures the extent to which learner s are\npersistent in achieving their L2 goals. After a series of stati stical\nanalyses (i.e., item analysis, reliability analysis and princ ipal\ncomponent analysis),\nTeimouri et al. (2020) retained 12 items,\nsix for consistency of interest (e.g., “My interests in learn ing\nEnglish changes from year to year”) and six for perseverance o f\neﬀorts (e.g., “I will not give up learning English until I master\nit”). Further analysis showed that the item-total correlati ons of 3\nitems did not reach the minimum criterion of 0.40 and were, th us,\ndiscarded. The 9 remaining items were then used to constitute t he\nL2 grit scale. They also reported a higher reliability for lan guage-\ndomain-speciﬁc grit than domain-general grit (t[190] = 84.34, p\n< 0.001, Cohen’s d = 0.81). All the items of the scale were rated\non a ﬁve-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (not at all like\nme) to 5 (very much like me) via the Persian version of the scale\nprovided by\nTeimouri et al. (2020) . The reliability indices of the\nscale based on Cronbach’s α and McDonald’s ω were 0.87 and\n0.88, respectively.\nData Collection\nThe data collection method was questionnaire-based. Both t he\nL2 grit scale and the FLE scale were given to the participants\nin four measurement occasions with 2-week intervals at the\noutset of the EFL courses (to take into account the initial st atus\nfactor). Based on the ﬁndings of the previous studies, IDs are\nsusceptible to micro, day to day changes, and macro, weekly\nand monthly changes. Given the length of a language course, i t\nis contended that the 2-week intervals between the time point s\nin this study could reﬂect the underlying causal lags in a of\ncourse of language learning. This longitudinal data collec tion\nhelped to measure changes in the target variable through time .\nIt also allowed for estimating the rate of changes at each phas e\nand accounted for inter-individual diﬀerences. Questionna ire\ncompletion was done step by step in the classroom in the presence\nof one of the researchers. The participants were made sure of\nthe conﬁdentiality of the information they provided and they all\nagreed to participate in this research.\nData Analysis\nPrior to the statistical analysis of the collected data, a tes t of\nnormality was used for all variables. Therefore, via kurtosis and\nskewness estimates and Kolmogorov–Smirnov test of normali ty,\nwe double-checked the normality of the variables. Also, LGCM\nwas applied to examine the covariances between the initial and\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 5 August 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 720326\nElahi Shirvan et al.

To do so,\nthe paths from intercept factors to the observed variables of L 2\ngrit and FLE were set as 1. In other words, intercept values\nwere constant across the four measurement occasions for all\nparticipants (see\nByrne, 2016 ). Also, following the procedures\nsuggested by Byrne (2016) , we constrained the paths from slope\nfactors to the observed variables to 0, 1, 2, and 3. This means\nthat 1, 2, and 3 reﬂect the same time intervals (4th, 6th, and 8 th\nweeks), with 0 standing for the 2nd week as the starting point\nof growth of the two variables. For testing the model, we used\nLGCM in Mplus 7.4 software.\nRESULTS\nPreliminary Analyses\nThe successful estimation of growth curves relies on the\nconsistency of higher associations of repeated indicators\nat adjacent occasions than correlations at non-adjacent\nmeasurement occasions (\nLorenz et al., 2004 ). As observed\nin Tables 1, 2, correlation matrix indicated that correlation\ncoeﬃcients between two adjacent occasions (t and t + 1) for\neach factor were higher than correlations between non-adja cent\noccasions (FLErs ranged from 0.26 to 0.49; L2 grit rs ranged\nfrom 0.34 to 0.53). Moreover, oﬀ-diagonal correlations of the\nsame repeated measure over time ( Tables 1, 2) showed to be\nquite diﬀerent from each other. These correlations show that\na signiﬁcant slope variation might exist for each global fact or\ntrajectory model.\nMAIN ANALYSES\nDirection of Change in FLE and L2 Grit\nAs for the direction and extent of change in FLE and L2 grit\nthat the participants experienced in the target English course ,\nFIGURE 1 |Parallel process model (PPM).

The results indicated that FLE ( MIntercept = 3.213, p\n< 0.001; MSlope= 0.814, p < 0.001) and L2 grit ( MIntercept = 4.121,\np < 0.001; MSlope = 0.565, p < 0.001) increased across time.\nHeterogeneity in Learners’ FLE and L2 Grit\nBesides, about the variance of both variables, the ﬁndings s howed\na signiﬁcant variance in intercept factors of FLE ( σ 2 = 0. 174,\np < 0.001) as well as those of L2 grit ( σ 2 = 0.221, p < 0.001)\nwhich shows heterogeneity in the participants’ FLE and L2 grit\nin the 1st session of the data collection, the initial sessio n within\nthe model. Moreover, a look at the signiﬁcance of the slope\nvariances to ﬁnd the growth patterns of FLE and L2 grit over\nthe semester showed a statistically signiﬁcant slope varianc e for\nFLE (σ 2 = 0.004, p < 0.001) and L2 grit ( σ 2 = 0.006, p < 0.001).\nStatistically signiﬁcant variances for two global factors i ndicate\nthe presence of inter-individual diﬀerences in the FLE and L2\ngrit developmental patterns. In other words, some participants\nwent through a higher rate of change in FLE and L2 grit, yet\nsome others experienced lower rates of FLE and L2 grit during\nthe course.\nPredictive Power of the Initial States of FLE\nand L2 Grit\nFurthermore, as indicated in Table 3, the negative covariance\nbetween the intercept and slope of FLE ( r = − 0.563, p < 0.001)\nand between the intercept and slope of L2 grit ( r = − 0.493, p\n< 0.001) suggested that lower initial scores in learners’ FLE and\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 6 August 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 720326\nElahi Shirvan et al.

It means that tho se\nstudents who started oﬀ at a higher level of FLE and L2 grit\nexhibited less change in FLE and L2 grit over time and those\nparticipants who started oﬀ at a lower level of FLE and L2 grit\nexhibited more change in their FLE and L2 grit over the term.\nAssociation of Change in FLE and L2 Grit\nOver Time\nThe analysis of co-variations in the model showed that the\ncovariance between the intercept factors for the FLE and L2 gr it\nwas moderate but statistically signiﬁcant (0.481, p < 0.001). A\nsimilar pattern of signiﬁcant covariance was observed betwe en\nthe FLE and L2 grit slope factors (0.594, p < 0.001), which\nindicated the existence of a parallel process (co-development )\nbetween FLE and L2 grit at the global factor level. This resul t\nimplied that the rise of the participants’ FLE was strongly\ncorrelated with the rise of their L2 grit during the course\nthough the correlation between participants’ FLE and L2 grit w as\nmoderate at the beginning of the course.\nDISCUSSION\nAs the present ﬁndings indicated, an increase in enjoyment\nwas associated with the increase in grit over time. This mean s\nthat the direction of change from initial level to growth\nlevels of these two factors was increasing. Moreover, the mea n\nof growth in both FLE and L2 grit was higher than the\nmean of their intercepts. This suggests the increase in both\nvariables during the semester. The increase in the intercept s\nand growth factors of FLE and L2 grit along with the positive\nassociation of these two variables can be explained by consid ering\nsome contextual factors reported in the ﬁndings of previous\nstudies, such as teacher’s emotional support, teacher’s acad emic\nsupport, challenging instruction and assessment, classroom\nmanagement (e.g., teacher’s control, well-organized clas sroom,\nchallenging and interesting activities), learning engage ment, and\nclassroom environment.\nIn our study, we found a negative covariance of the intercept\nand slope of FLE ( r = − 0.563, p < 0.001) which meant that lower\ninitial scores in learners’ FLE demonstrated a steeper incre ase\nover time. On the other hand, those participants who started\noﬀ at a higher level of FLE experienced less change in FLE over\ntime while those learners whose initial level of FLE was very low\nexhibited more change in their FLE over time. This means that\nthe initial status of FLE (either high or low) does not necess arily\nguarantee the maintenance of a similarly high or low level of\nthe construct over time. This ﬁnding is in agreement with the\nworks of research by\nElahi Shirvan and Taherian (2021) and Elahi\nShirvan et al. (2021) who concluded that the initial states of FLE\ndid not predict students’ growth during the semester. Theref ore,\nwe postulate that the high growth of enjoyment in EFL learners\nwith lower initial FLE as well as the inter-individual varian ce of\nlearners in their initial stage and growth level of enjoymen t may\nbe associated with teacher-related factors like teacher’s support as\nspeculated in previous studies (e.g.,\nElahi Shirvan and Taherian,\n2021; Elahi Shirvan et al., 2021 ).\nAlso, inspired by Fredrickson’s Broad-and-Build Theory\n(2001, 2003) proclaiming that “positive emotions broaden an\nindividual’s momentary mindset, and by doing so help to build\nenduring personal resources’ (\nFredrickson, 2003 , p. 332) and\nsimilar to the ﬁndings of previous studies (e.g., De Ruiter et al.,\n2019; Lee, 2020; Elahi Shirvan and Taherian, 2021; Elahi Shi rvan\net al., 2021 ), we can conjecture that teachers’ emotional support,\nsuch as their warmth and friendliness, during the EFL course may\nincrease positive emotions like enjoyment in learners over t ime.\nTherefore, it is expected that teacher’s warmth and friendli ness\ncan create a safe, nurturing environment for students with\ninitially low enjoyment level so that they can experience mor e\nenjoyment during later sessions of the course.\nThe increase in EFL learners’ enjoyment during the course\nmight be also possibly supported by the classroom environment,\nas suggested by the previous studies (e.g.,\nElahi Shirvan and\nTaherian, 2020, 2021; Li et al., 2020 ) helping learners to overcome\ndiﬃculties in a friendly atmosphere. Also, as contended by Joe\net al. (2017) , within the safe, positive, and high-caring classroom\nenvironment, mutual respects and peer-interactions and soci al\nconnections among peers are highly encouraged. Within this\nclassroom environment, learning is combined with pleasure a nd\ninterpersonal relations (\nDewaele and MacIntyre, 2014 ).\nAccordingly, in line with the ﬁndings of prior works of\nresearch ( Dewaele and MacIntyre, 2014; Khajavy et al., 2018;\nDewaele et al., 2019a; Elahi Shirvan and Taherian, 2021 ), we\ncan hypothesize that another factor that may inﬂuence the\ngrowth level of EFL learners’ enjoyment can be classroom\nclimate especially social climate that teachers create in cla ssroom.\nA classroom environment in which students can feel safe to\nexpress their opinions might help learners develop a friendly\nrelationship and a social connection with their classmates. This\nmight lead to the increase in EFL learner’s conﬁdence and sen se of\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 7 August 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 720326\nElahi Shirvan et al. Foreign Language Enjoyment and L2 Grit\ncooperation which in turn might increase the level of enjoyme nt\nin the classroom.\nGiven the increasing pattern in the learners’ growth of L2\ngrit, inspired by the ﬁndings of the previous studies ( Banse\nand Palacios, 2018 ), we can conjecture that the increase in\nlearners’ grit during an EFL course may be related to some\ncontextual factors such as teacher’s classroom management ,\nwhich may consist of class control, challenging instructio n, tasks\nand assessment and a well-organized class, teacher’s support and\nclassroom engagement.\nBanse and Palacios (2018) reported that the level of grit\nincreased in those students who perceived their teacher’s hi gh\nlevel of care and class management (e.g., control and classr oom\norganization) as a factor to increase their eﬀort in class. Hi gh level\nof classroom management motivates students to be involved w ith\nmore on-task behaviors in classroom and accordingly increa sing\ntheir grit. According to Banse and Palacios (2018) , a teacher\nwith a well-organized classroom can create an environment\nfor students to divide their long-term goals into smaller on es\nand try to master the content more deeply. Thus, in terms of\nclassroom management, acceptable classroom management of\nteachers during an EFL course such as having good control of\nthe situation, creative methods of instruction, encouragi ng more\ncooperation among students and a well-organized lesson plan a s\nwell as reasonable challenging assessments can be hypothesi zed\nto contribute to the increase in EFL learner’s perseverance, which\nin turn may encourage them to make more eﬀorts to improve\ntheir performance.\nIn addition, we can postulate that another possible factor that\ncan increase EFL students’ grit may be related to the amount o f\nsupport that teachers give to their students. Therefore, we ca n\nconclude that just like enjoyment, grit can also be consider ed\na teacher-related factor. That is, consistently with the ﬁnd ings\nof the previous studies (e.g.,\nKeegan, 2017; Lee and Drajati,\n2019; Lee and Hsieh, 2019; Lee, 2020; Yoon et al., 2020 ) we\ncan attribute increase in the growth level of EFL learners’ g rit\nto teachers’ behavioral and cognitive or meta-cognitive su pports\nsuch as their encouragement of a sense of cooperation instead\nof competition, breaking down students’ long-term goals int o\nmore speciﬁc, immediate ones to provide a chance for giving\nfeedback and coaching them to achieve their goals in a more\nconsistent way.\nBesides, in alignment with the observations of the previous\nworks of research (e.g.,\nVon Culin et al., 2014; Wolters and\nHussain, 2015; Datu et al., 2016; Aparicio et al., 2017; Hodge\net al., 2017; Wei et al., 2019\n) which indicated that those students\nwho are grittier are proved to be more engaged in class activit ies,\nengagement can be regarded as another possible factor in the\ngrowth of EFL learners’ grit.\nThe present ﬁndings revealed that besides a moderate\ncorrelation between the participants’ FLE and L2 grit at the\nopening of the course, FLE and L2 grit were co-developed at\ngrowth level as well. This means that the increase in enjoyme nt\nwas signiﬁcantly associated with the increase in grit durin g\nsemester and vice versa. One possible reason for the covarian ce\nof both variables at the growth level can be related to teache r’s\nsupport and the contribution of classroom environment to the\nincrease in the growth of both grit and enjoyment. As mention ed\npreviously, in line with the ﬁndings of\nBanse and Palacios (2018) ,\nwe hypothesized that environmental features of class such as\nteacher’s warmth, care, positive feedback, friendly classmates, and\npositive class atmosphere can increase learners’ conﬁdence a nd\nconsequently, boost their eﬀort in classroom to improve their\nperformance while enjoying their class. Moreover,\nWei et al.\n(2019) also found the classroom environment as a mediating\nfactor inﬂuencing the association between grit and enjoyme nt.\nThey concluded that a positive classroom environment increas ed\nstudents’ grit, which in turn paved the way for an increase in\ntheir level of enjoyment. They also found that enjoyment had\na mediating role in increasing students’ eﬀort through foste ring\ntheir cognitive and mental resources, as the result of which\nthey were able to improve their foreign language achievement .\nTherefore, enjoyment and grit are supposed to have reciprocal\neﬀects on each other and as the ﬁndings of our study showed, thi s\nreciprocal inﬂuence grows during the semester. This means th at\nwhen students enjoy the class, they continue to learn and mak e\neﬀorts in learning even if the situation gets diﬃcult and in do ing\nso, their level of enjoyment may increase.\nThis co-development of grit and enjoyment during an EFL\ncourse can also be enhanced by teacher’s class management. As\nhighlighted in previous studies (\nCameron et al., 2005; Kang,\n2005; Elahi Shirvan and Taherian, 2020 ), we can conjecture\nthat designing well-organized activities with an optimal le vel\nof challenge and creating more pair-work and group-work\nactivities can facilitate positive emotions and increase the sense\nof cooperation and eﬀort among students to reach the desired\nresult (e.g.,\nDuckworth et al., 2009; Hill et al., 2016; Wei et al.,\n2019). This is consistent with studies which found a positive\nassociation between enjoyment and grit. They concluded tha t\ngrittier students who show better academic behaviors have m ore\noptimistic growth mindsets and, therefore, have higher leve ls\nof enjoyment.\nCONCLUSION\nWe explored the covariance of the initial and growth levels of\n437 EFL learners’ FLE and grit over four measurement occasio ns\nvia the innovative method of LGCM. The ﬁndings indicated\na signiﬁcant and large association between the growth level s\nof both variables over time. The ﬁndings imply that aﬀective\nengagement in terms of experiencing a positive emotion like\nenjoyment can be tightly associated with more perseverance\nand enjoyment for EFL learners during an EFL course. From\na pedagogical perspective, the ﬁndings indicate that during a\nlanguage course learners’ enjoyment can increase in associ ation\nwith their perseverance and eﬀort. Thus, the initial levels of\nlearners’ grit and enjoyment should be regarded by teachers\nas the benchmark for their evaluation of their learners’ sta tes\nof these variables in a foreign language course. Instead, via\nthe activation of contextual stimuli and their pivotal role i n\nthe class, as both variables are teacher-related, teachers can\ndirect their learners to the point that they make more eﬀorts\nand maintain higher level of interest for the long term goal\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 8 August 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 720326\nElahi Shirvan et al. Foreign Language Enjoyment and L2 Grit\nof language acquisition while experiencing more enjoyment\nduring the course than its prior sessions. In other words, wit h\nregard to the pedagogical implications of the ﬁndings, langua ge\nteachers should consider grit as a variable within the nomol ogical\nnetwork of their learners’ experience of enjoyment. Thus, gi ven\nthe teacher-dependent nature of enjoyment, any endeavors by\nlanguage teachers to improve their learners’ sense of enjoym ent\nover time can help their learners sustain their eﬀorts and int erests\nfor the achievement of English language. On the other hand,\ndue to the bidirectional association of FLE and L2 grit over\ntime, any stimulating behavior by language teachers to enco urage\nfurther perseverance and consistency of interest in their le arners\ncan help them feel more enjoyment in their language learning\nprocess. Regarding the limitations of the study, it should be n oted\nthat the longitudinal phase of this study was limited to 2-wee k\nintervals with the participants ﬁlling in the same scales in th ese\nintervals. Further research can focus on the temporal covari ance\nof L2 grit and FLE with longer intervals. Also, we should note\nthat the incorporation of qualitative stage could provide us w ith\nfurther explanations regarding our quantitative data analys is.\nFurther studies can consider conducting a mixed-methods st udy\nfor the interpretation of the ﬁndings. Also, the inclusion of the\nlearners’ achievement as the outcome as well the predictor in\nthe longitudinal model of this study can provide further deta ils\nregarding the factors contributing to the co-development of FLE\nand L2 grit during a foreign language course.\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be\nmade available by the authors, without undue reservation.\nETHICS STATEMENT\nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and\napproved by University of Bojnord.
