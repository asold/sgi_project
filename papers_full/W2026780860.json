  "full_text": "EDITORIAL\npublished: 06 October 2014\ndoi: 10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01107\nThe cognitive and neural bases of human tool use\nFrançois Osiurak1,2* and Cristina Massen3,4\n1\nLaboratoire d’Etude des Mécanismes Cognitifs, Université Lyon 2, Lyon, France\n2 Institut Universitaire de France, Paris, France\n3 Leibniz Research Centre for Working Environment and Human Factors, Dortmund, Germany\n4 Bonn-Rhein-Sieg University of Applied Sciences, Rheinbach, Germany\n*Correspondence: francois.osiurak@univ-lyon2.fr\nEdited and reviewed by:\nBernhard Hommel, Leiden University, Netherlands\nKeywords: tool use, action, motor control, neural bases, cognitive bases\nIt is a euphemism to say that humans use tools. Humans possess\na vast repertoire of tools they use every day. In fact, as language\nor bipedal locomotion, tool use is a hallmark of humans. T ool use\nhas also been often viewed as an important step during evolu-\ntion (van Schaik et al., 1999 )o re v e na sam a r k e ro ft h ee v o l u t i o n\nof human intelligence ( Wynn, 1985). So a fundamental issue is,\nwhat are the cognitive and neural bases of human tool use? The\npresent series of papers in this special topic represents the newest\nadditions to that research topic.\nCentral to that topic is the issue of the nature of the repre-\nsentations underlying tool use. Most of our understanding has\ncome from the study of brain-damaged patients with tool use\ndisorders, also called apraxia of tool use. When asked to light a\ncandle, for example, those patients can light the candle correctly\nbut then put it to the mouth in an attempt to smoke it. Such\nobservations have led traditional cognitive models of apraxia to\nassume that tool use is supported by sensorimotor knowledge\nabout tool manipulation (e.g., Rothi et al., 1991; Buxbaum, 2001 ).\nConsistent with this, Gainotti (2013) reviews a series of neuropsy-\nchological and neuroimaging studies indicating that perceptual,\nmotor, and encyclopedic sources of knowledge have different\nweights in the construction of the different object categories (i.e.,\nliving things, tools) that are stored within the brain. This sensory-\nmotor hypothesis assumes that manipulation knowledge stored\nwithin inferior fronto-parietal areas is critical to tool use skills.\nThis link is also suggested by van Elk (2014), who conducted an\nfMRI study wherein participants had to predict the subsequent\nuse of a presented tool. His results indicate that the left inferior\nparietal lobe might store hand-posture representations that can\nbe used for planning tool-directed actions as well as for predicting\nother’s actions.\nContrary to the traditional cognitive models of apraxia, a\ngrowing body of literature suggests that the left inferior parietal\nlobe might rather support technical reasoning, namely, the abil-\nity to reason about physical object properties ( Goldenberg and\nSpatt, 2009; Osiurak et al., 2009, 2010, 2013; Goldenberg, 2013;\nOsiurak, 2014). Support for the technical reasoning hypothesis\ncomes from ﬁndings demonstrating a strong association in left\nbrain-damaged patients between the ability to use familiar tools\nand the ability to use novel tools to solve mechanical problems\n(for reviews, see Goldenberg, 2013; Osiurak, 2014). Four review\narticles of this special issue also provide evidence in line with the\ntechnical reasoning hypothesis. Bienkiewicz et al. (2014) , Orban\nand Caruana (2014) ,a n d Vingerhoets (2014) emphasize that the\nability to understand mechanical actions might be the speciﬁcity\nof the anterior portions of the inferior parietal lobe (particu-\nlarly the supramarginal gyrus) while the posterior parietal cortex\nmight be involved in the planning of the grasping and reaching\ncomponents of both tool-use and non-tool-use actions. In the\nsame vein, by reviewing studies investigating tool use disorders\nin left brain-damaged patients over the last 30 years, Baumard\net al. (2014) suggest that the loss of mechanical knowledge might\nbe the core deﬁcit in left brain-damaged patients with apraxia of\ntool use.\nTwo experimental articles also address the issue of the involve-\nment of mechanical vs. manipulation knowledge in tool use. First,\nParry et al. (2014) examine both functional dynamics (i.e., the\nunderstanding of the mechanical actions involved in the task)\nand joint contribution proﬁles of participants with different lev-\nels of expertise in a primordial percussive task (i.e., production\nof stone ﬂakes using the Oldowan method). Their results show\nthat when people learn a tool use activity what they learn is\nthe functional dynamics rather than any particular movement\nper se. Second, Müsseler et al. (2014) asked participants to use\nlever tools or to imagine using them in order to explore the role\nplayed in response generation by the spatial compatibility rela-\ntionships between stimulus (S; at which the effect points of the\nlever aims at), responding hand (R) and effect point of the lever\n(E). They observed that the most prominent compatibility effects\nwere for RE compatibility, corroborating the idea that even in\ntool use planning is inﬂuenced not only by the spatial relation-\nship between stimulus and response, but also by the intended\naction effects. Similar results are reported by Rieger et al. (2014) ,\nwho had participants perform circling movements with a sty-\nlus (movement) and presented distorted visual feedback of the\nmovements on a screen (visual effect). When participants had to\nsynchronize the visual feedback dot with a second, rotating stimu-\nlus on the screen (stimulus), strong compatibility effects emerged\nfor the relationship between the hand movement (response) and\nthe visual effect of this movement on the screen.\nAs Fagard et al. (2014) state, the development of tool use\nin human infants has received little interest until recently. For\nexample, an unresolved issue is whether tool use appears through\nsudden insight or emerges progressively through familiarization\nwith experience. Fagard et al. (2014) address this issue by con-\nducting a longitudinal study on ﬁve infants from age 12 to 20\nwww.frontiersin.org October 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 1107| 1\n\nOsiurakand Massen Cognition and tool use\nmonths. Children have to use a rake-like tool to reach toys pre-\nsented out of reach. Their results indicate that it is only between\n16 and 20 months that the infants suddenly start to intentionally\ntry to bring the toy closer with the tool. For them, this sudden suc-\ncess at about 18 months might correspond to the coming together\nof a variety of capacities, such as the development of means-end\nbehavior.\nT ools are also speciﬁc because they modify our perception of\nthe world. For instance, it is known that using a tool can alter\nspace perception in that far stimuli become processed as if they\nwere nearer ( Maravita and Iriki, 2004; Witt et al., 2005; Osiurak\net al., 2012). Likewise, body representations can be modiﬁed when\nusing a tool so that the tool is incorporated and becomes part\nof our body ( Iriki et al., 1996; Cardinalli et al., 2009 ). An inter-\nesting issue, however, is whether these modiﬁcations only occur\nafter the real use of tools or can also appear in a tool-use imagery\ncondition. Baccarini et al. (2014) provide a positive answer to this\nissue by showing that tool-use imagery is sufﬁcient to affect the\nrepresentation of the user’s arm.\nIn line with the view of common representations for percep-\ntion, imagery, and action, Kelly and Wheaton (2013) investigate\nthe understanding of tool-use actions viewed from different per-\nspectives and conclude that perception and understanding is\nfacilitated when tool-use actions are viewed from an egocentric\n(as opposed to allocentric) perspective.\nFinally, two theoretical papers also contribute to this special\ntopic on broader issues. In line with the extended mind view,\nBorghi et al. (2013) suggest that words can be conceived as quasi-\nexternal devices (or tools) that extend our cognition. For example,\nwords function like tools because they also enlarge the bod-\nily space of action and, as a result, modify our sense of body.\nBaber et al. (2014) propose the notion of distributed cognition\nto account that tool use is not only based on internal representa-\ntions (e.g., manipulation knowledge or mechanical knowledge)\nbut also external representations such as the location of tools\nwithin the workspace.\nIn sum, this special issue includes a series of articles from neu-\nropsychology, neuroimaging, experimental psychology, develop-\nmental psychology, and ergonomics that provide very interesting\nﬁndings and open new issues for future research on the topic. Let’s\nhope that we possess the good tools to solve them!\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported by grants from ANR (Agence\nNationale pour la Recherche; Project “Dèmences et Utilisation\nd’Outils/Dementia and T ool Use,” N\n◦ANR 2011 MALZ 006\n03; François Osiurak; Project “Cognition et économie liée à\nl’outil/Cognition and tool-use economy” ECOTOOL, François\nOsiurak), and was performed within the framework of the LABEX\nCORTEX (ANR-11-LABX-0042) of Universitè de Lyon (François\nOsiurak), within the program “Investissements d’Avenir” (ANR-\n11- IDEX-0007) operated by the French National Research\nAgency (ANR).\nREFERENCES\nBaber, C., Parekh, M., and Cengiz, T.
