INTRODUCTION\nOil impregnated paper (OIP) is widely used as a solid insu-\nlating material in power equipment, such as power transform-\ners [1]. During the operation of the power equipment, OIP\ngradually degrades due to the multi-stresses it is subjected to.\nSince insulation condition is a key factor for reliable opera-\ntion of power equipment, evaluation of insulation condition\nhas received much attention by researchers and industry [2].\nThe useful remaining operational life of a power trans-\nformer is identiﬁed based on the condition of its solid insu-\nlation that is measured using the degree of polymerization\n(DP) [3]. According to [4], initial DP value of fresh paper\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Dusmanta Kumar Kumar Mohanta\n .\nis within the range 1000-1200 which drops to 200-300 when\nthe insulation paper reaches end-of-life. While DP is the\nmost accurate indicator to assess the decomposition of paper\ninsulation, it is rarely used by industry due to the complexity\nof collecting paper samples, especially from hotspot loca-\ntions. As such, much research efforts have been conducted\nto correlate the DP value with other measurable chemical\nindicators and oil characteristics [5]–[13]. These indicators\ninclude furan compound (2-Fal) [5], [6], carbon oxides (CO\nand CO 2) [7], [8], hydrocarbon gases (CH 4, C 2H6, C 2H4,\nC2H2) [9], methanol (MeOH) [10], ethanol (EtOH) [11],\nmoisture in oil [12] and oil interfacial tension [13].\nPaper insulation comprises approximately 90% of cellulose,\n6-7% hemi-cellulose and 3-4% of lignin [14]. Cellulose is\na linear polymer of glucose molecules connected through\nVOLUME 7, 2019 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Liet al.: New Technique to Estimate the DP of Insulation Paper Using Multiple Aging Parameters of Transformer Oil\nglycosidic bonds [15]. Due to high thermal stresses, hydrogen\nbonds tend to breakdown resulting in a shorter cellulose\nmolecular chain and chemical by-products are formed and\ndissolve in the oil. Furanic compounds and moisture are\nthe main hydrolysis by-products of cellulose degradation\n[5], [12]. Carbon oxides and hydrocarbon gases are used in\nthe Chinese standard DLT 722 to diagnose the transformer\nhealth condition [9]. According to [11], methanol is proved\nto measure the rupture of 1, 4- β-glycosidic bonds of cellu-\nlose, and ethanol is regarded as a high temperature thermal\ndecomposition by-product of insulating paper. Oil interfacial\ntension identiﬁes the insulation aging activity correlated with\nthe acidity of the oil [13]. Each of these 8 oil aging parameters\nhas a strong correlation with the DP of insulating paper.\nEstimating the DP based on one single indicator results\nin inconsistent DP values for the same oil-paper sample.\nThis is attributed to the lack of accuracy of the developed\nmathematical and artiﬁcial intelligence models correlating\nthese individual indicators with the DP value. Moreover, such\ncorrelations vary with the type of oil and paper, oil-paper\nratio and transformer operating conditions. Table 1 shows the\ncorrelation between the DP value and various individual oil\naging parameters as suggested in the literature [5]–[13].\nTABLE 1. Correlation of DP value and various oil aging parameters.\nThese various correlations do not necessarily lead to the\nsame DP value for the same oil-paper sample. Even for the\nsame aging parameter, various mathematical models can be\nfound. For instance the correlation between 2-Fal and DP\nvalue has been modeled using various mathematical equa-\ntions as summarized in Figure 1. From this ﬁgure, it can\nbe seen that the deviation of the DP values calculated using\nFIGURE 1. Comparison of different correlations of the DP and 2-Fal\ncompound.\nvarious mathematical models increases with the increase\nof 2-Fal concentration, especially when the DP value drops\nbelow 600. Such large deviation leads to inconsistent diag-\nnosis for the paper condition when these mathematical mod-\nels are employed for the same oil-paper sample. Therefore,\nan empirical equation with static coefﬁcients using single\naging parameter always fails to reveal accurate DP value\nof the insulation paper that is normally functioning under\ntransformer harsh and dynamic operating conditions. Thus,\nthe demand for a new self-learning model to estimate more\naccurate DP value based on multiple insulation aging param-\neters is essential.\nThe main contribution of this paper is the presentation of\na new self-learning method to estimate the DP value of paper\ninsulation based on multiple oil aging parameters that can be\neasily measured using transformer oil samples. In this con-\ntext, series of thermal aging experiments on oil-paper sam-\nples are conducted and the proposed indicators are measured\nand randomly split into training and testing datasets. The\nproposed method comprises data processing, fuzzy-c means\n(FCM) and linear regression (LR). After data processing and\ndetermination of hyper parameters, the FCM-LR method is\nconducted on the training dataset to develop the model. This\nmodel is then examined using the reserved testing dataset.\nFurthermore, the proposed FCM-LR method is applied on\nother thermal aging experimental conditions and different\ntypes of oil and paper to further validate the robustness of\nthe developed model when employed by different oil-paper\nmaterials.\nII. THERMAL AGING EXPERIMENTS AND TESTING\nRESULTS\nSeries of thermal aging experiments were performed on\noil-paper samples. In this regard, Weidmann T4 pressboard\nof 1 mm thickness and Karamay (KI 50X) transformer oil\nwere chosen as the solid and liquid insulating materials,\nrespectively. Several 2.5 mm ×4.7 mm paper samples were\nimmersed in 500 mL of the insulating oil. All oil-paper\nsamples were kept in glass bottles that were heated up in a\n157472 VOLUME 7, 2019\nS. Liet al.: New Technique to Estimate the DP of Insulation Paper Using Multiple Aging Parameters of Transformer Oil\nthermally controlled oven for 240 days. During this period,\nthe temperature within the oven was maintained at 90 ◦C and\naged oil-paper samples were extracted every 24 days to mea-\nsure the above-mentioned aging parameters. This process was\nrepeated under other oven temperatures; 110 ◦C and 130 ◦C.\nThus, after the three thermal aging experiments, a total\nof 30 aged samples were obtained.\nAll tests on aged oil-paper samples were conducted in\naccordance to the standards listed in Table 2. The paper DP\nmeasurement was conducted following the IEC 60450 in\nwhich the speciﬁc viscosity of cellulose solution is mea-\nsured to assess the DP value with the help of Mark\nHouwink equations [16]. DGA was conducted following\nthe IEC 60567 standards using gas chromatography [17].\nInterfacial tension of oil was measured following the ISO\n6295-1983 guides [18]. 2-Fal in oil was determined following\nIEC 61198 standards using high performance liquid chro-\nmatography [19]. The moisture measurement was conducted\nfollowing IEC 60814 guides using Karl Fisher titration [20].\nSince speciﬁc international standard for measurement of\nmethanol and ethanol in oil has not been set yet, test proce-\ndure is conducted by following the method in using headspace\ngas chromatography mass spectroscopy [21].\nTABLE 2. Tests for aged samples with related standards.\nIn the proposed method, the target parameter is the DP\nvalue while the 8 oil aging parameters shown in the ﬁrst\ncolumn of Table 1 are the input parameters to the model.\nTherefore, the dataset used in this method consists of 30 indi-\nviduals with 8 attributes and 1 label. The dataset is randomly\nsplit into training and testing datasets with a ratio of 4:1.\nIn order to examine the performance of the proposed\nmethod when applied to different oil-paper materials, other\nthermal aging experiments were performed on palm oil and\nanother type of mineral oil (mineral oil 2), respectively.\nSince these two types of transformer oil are still in research\nstage, the commercial names are protected due to conﬁden-\ntial policy. Various solid insulating materials as shown in\nTable 3 were used in this experiment. These solid and liquid\nmaterials were aged in a thermal aging chamber placed in\nthermal oven at 150 ◦C for a duration of 200, 500, 1000 hours\n(for mineral oil samples) and 500, 1000, 2000 hours (for\npalm oil samples). The above mentioned parameters were\nmeasured in accordance to the standards in Table 2. This\nprocess was repeated at temperature of 165 ◦C for durations\nof 50, 100, 200 hours for mineral oil samples and 100, 200,\nTABLE 3. Quantity and size of solid and liquid materials placed in the\nthermal aging chamber.\n500 hours for palm oil samples. It was also repeated at a\ntemperature of 180 ◦C for 20, 50, 100 hours for mineral oil\nsamples and 50, 100, 200 hours for palm oil samples. Hence\nnine aged samples for each oil type were tested and therefore,\n2 datasets consisting of 9 individuals with 8 attributes and\n1 label were obtained.\nThe correlations of the paper DP value and the eight indi-\nvidual aging parameters for the above thermal aging exper-\niments including the investigated three oil types are shown\nin Figure 2. As can be seen in these plots, each aging param-\neter exhibits inconsistent mathematical correlation with the\npaper DP value due to the different types of oil and paper\nas well as the thermal aging experimental conditions. Results\nshow that some oil aging parameters such as interfacial ten-\nsion and 2-Fal compound comprise similar correlation with\nFIGURE 2. Correlation between DP and each single aging parameter.\nVOLUME 7, 2019 157473\nS. Liet al.: New Technique to Estimate the DP of Insulation Paper Using Multiple Aging Parameters of Transformer Oil\nthe DP value for different thermal aging experimental results.\nHowever substantial difference on the range of DP value\ncan be observed among different thermal aging experimental\nresults. This validates the fact that a ﬁxed equation correlating\none oil aging parameter with the paper DP value is not very\naccurate which poses the demand for a more ﬂexible and\naccurate method to reveal the DP correlation with multiple\naging parameters.\nIII. ALGORITHM OF THE PROPOSED MODEL\nThe algorithm consists of several steps namely; data pro-\ncessing, fuzzy c-means (FCM), linear regression (LR) and\nevaluation. These steps are brieﬂy elaborated below.\nA. DATA PROCESSING BASED ON GREEDY ALGORITHM\nAs can be seen in the results of Figure 2, oil aging parameters\nexhibit various correlation patterns with the DP of paper\ninsulation. For example, while this correlation is almost linear\nin case of interfacial tension, it is exponential in case of 2-Fal.\nTherefore, a kind of adaptive data processing method based\non greedy algorithm as shown in Figure 3 is proposed in\nthis paper to estimate this correlation. In this method, data\nprocessing is initially performed on one of the eight attributes\nto form a new combination Ai,s with the original data of the\nother attributes. Comparison is then conducted between the\nnew data combination ( Ai,s) and the previous ones ( Ai−1,s).\nOnce the FCM-LR method on processed data reveal better\nperformance, the new processed data replace the previous one\nand continue to the next attribute until all attributes are being\nconsidered. This optimization process is repeated 3 times in\norder to determine the ultimate proper combination of data\nprocessing method for each attribute.\nFIGURE 3. Data processing method based on greedy algorithm\n(i represents ith attribute, s represents the iteration step,\nN represents the total number of individuals).\nAfter the data processing stage, normalization of input data\nas in (1) is conducted in order to limit the data into a standard\nscale. After normalization, the mean value of the normalized\ndata vector x∗\ni equals to 0, with a standard deviation equals\nto 1.\nx∗\ni =xi −E (xi)√D (xi) (1)\nwhere x∗\ni is the normalized vector data of ith attribute,\nE(xi) represents the mathematical expectation value of data\nvector xi and D(xi) represents the variance of data xi.\nB. FUZZY C-MEANS (FCM)\nClustering is a typical unsupervised training method to solve\nunlabeled data analysis problem. FCM is a typical fuzzy\nclustering model, which assigns a degree of membership to\nevery cluster center. FCM is built based on minimizing the\nbelow objective function Jm [22].\nJm =\nN∑\ni=1\nNc∑\nj=1\num\nij\nxi −cj\n2, 1 ≤m <∞ (2)\nwhere N represents the total number of attributes, Nc repre-\nsents the number of cluster centers, m is a real number greater\nthan 1, uij is the degree of membership of xi in the cluster j,\ncj is the jth cluster center, and ||∗||is the Euclidean norm that\nis revealing the similarity between any train input data and\nthe cluster center.\nIn FCM method, Nc and m are two key hyper parame-\nters which need to be determined before calculation. Fuzzy\nportioning is carried out using an iterative optimization of\nthe objective function Jm, with the update of the degree of\nmembership uij and the cluster centers cj as below.\nuij = 1\nC∑\nk=1\n(∥xi−cj∥\n∥xi−ck ∥\n) 2\nm−1\n(3)\ncj =\nN∑\ni=1\num\nij ·xi\nN∑\ni=1\num\nij\n(4)\nThis iteration process terminates when\nmaxij{|u(k+1)\nij −u(k)\nij |}<δ, where δis a value between 0 and\n1 and kis the iteration step.\nThis procedure converges to a local minimum or a sad-\ndle point of Jm. After iterative computation, the degree of\nmembership values, uij are obtained to form the input matrix\nfor the linear regression stage. For example, if FCM model\nof 10 cluster centers ( Nc =10) is trained and established on\ntraining dataset consisting of 24 individuals with 8 attributes,\nthe calculation will generate a 10 ×8 cluster center matrix C\nas well as a 24 ×10 degree of membership matrix U.\nC. LINEAR REGRESSION (LR)\nLR serves as a linear approach to model the relationship\nbetween dependent and independent variables. In the pro-\nposed FCM-LR method, the dependent variable is the DP\nvalue of the paper insulation while the independent variables\n157474 VOLUME 7, 2019\nS. Liet al.: New Technique to Estimate the DP of Insulation Paper Using Multiple Aging Parameters of Transformer Oil\ncomprise the degree of memberships obtained from the FCM.\nThe independent variable matrix Z given in (5) comprises\ndegree of membership matrix U together with a column\nvector of ones.\nZ =\n\n\n1 u11 u12 ··· u1j\n1 u21 u22 ··· u2j\n1 u31 u32 ··· u3j\n... ... ... ... ...\n1 ui1 ui2 ··· uij\n\n\n(5)\nLR algorithm can be presented in a matrix notation as\nin (6). The purpose of LR is to ﬁnd a proper parameter vector\nβ so as to minimize the error vector εwith the help of least\nsquares estimation technique. For example, if FCM transfers\na 24 ×10 degree of membership matrix U into LR, M will\nbe a 24 ×11 independent variable matrix, and parameter β\nis an 11 ×1 vector.\nDP =Z ·β+ε (6)\nD. EVALUATION\nThe coefﬁcient of determination ( R2) is a typical evaluation\nindicator of regression performance, which is calculated as\nin (7). In the proposed FCM-LR method, R2 is regarded as a\nsingle evaluation indicator of the FCM-LR model during the\ncalculation.\nR2 =1 −\n∑(DPestimated −DP)2\n∑(\nDP −DP\n)2 (7)\nwhere DPestimated represents the estimated DP value, which\nequals to Z ·βobtained from (6), and DP represents the mean\nof the DP values.\nAlso, the coefﬁcient of correlation ( CC) and mean square\nerror (MSE) given in (8) and (9) are applied to further evaluate\nthe performance of the proposed method.\nCC = Cov (DP,DPestimated )√Var (DP)Var (DPestimated ) (8)\nMSE = 1\nN\nN∑\ni=1\n(DPi −(DPestimated )i)2 (9)\nwhere Cov(DP, DPestimated ) represents the covariance\nbetween DP and DPestimated , Var(DP) represents the variance\nof DP, Var(DPestimated ) represents the variance of DPestimated\nIV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nA. INFLUENCE OF DATA PROCESSING\nIn order to show the inﬂuence of data processing, the value\nof R2 and its bias are obtained as a function of the num-\nber of attributes using the row original and the processed\ndata as shown in Figure 4. As can be seen in Figure 4,\nthe performance of the processed data becomes more accurate\nthan the original data. This accuracy is improved with the\nincrease of the number of attributes. These results reveal that\nmore attributes result in more accurate estimated value for\nthe dependent parameter. Furthermore, after data processing,\nFIGURE 4. R2 as a function of the number of attributes considered in the\nmodel based on original data and processed data (Nc = 15, m = 3).\nthe performance of the model gets further progress compared\nwith the model based on only original values, which indicates\nthe necessity of data processing.\nB. DETERMINATION OF HYPER PARAMETERS\nHyper parameters in FCM model need to be determined\nbefore computation, including Nc and m parameters. The\nnumber of cluster centers Nc describes the number of groups\nwhich the input data belong to. This parameter inﬂuences\nthe compactness of the fuzzy clustering model. Generally,\nmore clustering centers improve the accuracy of the FCM,\nbut increases the computation complexity from the other side,\nespecially if it deals with big dataset. Besides, increase of\nthe cluster number will probably face the risk of overﬁt-\nting on training dataset. It is of importance to pick up an\nappropriate value to reduce the computation complexity and\nrisk of overﬁtting in the case of high ﬁtting performance.\nThe other parameter m, which describes the fuzziness of\nthe FCM, corresponds to the compactness and separation of\nFCM model. High value of m reduces the fuzziness of FCM,\nmaking it closer to crispy clustering method. In the proposed\nFCM model, these two hyper parameters are determined\nusing grid search method. During the computation, the value\nof integrator Nc ranges from 2 to 15, while m ranges from\n1 to 5 with a step of 0.1. The heat map of R2 as a function\nof both Nc and m is shown in Figure 5(a) while Figure 5(b)\nshows the average of R2 for the range of m at different Nc\nvalues and Figure 5(c) shows the average of R2 for the range\nof Nc at different m values. This ﬁgure shows that despite\nof the same FCM method, the performance of each model\ndepends on the values of the hyper parameters. The proper\nvalue for Nc falls within the range of 8 to 15 while m falls\nwithin the range of 1.1 to 2.5.\nC. PERFORMANCE OF THE DEVELOPED MODEL ON\nTESTING DATASET\nIn order to examine the prediction accuracy of the devel-\noped FCM-LR model, proper data processing method of each\nattribute and position of cluster centers are obtained and\nthen tested using the testing dataset after sufﬁcient training.\nVOLUME 7, 2019 157475\nS.

(a) Heat map of theR2 of training dataset as a function of\nNc and m, (b)R2 as a function ofNc and (c)R2 as a function ofm.\nFIGURE 6. (a) Heat map of theR2 of testing dataset as a function of\nNc and m, (b)R2 as a function ofNc and (c)R2 as a function ofm.\nSimilar to the training dataset performance shown in Figure 5,\nthe heat map of R2 of the FCM-LR model using the testing\ndataset as a function of NC and m is shown in Figure 6.\nGenerally, R2 of FCM on testing dataset exhibits similar\ntrend as the one resulted from the training dataset shown\nin Figure 5, especially for the plot of R2 as a function of m\n(Figure 6 (c)). However, small difference appears on the plot\nof R2 as a function of Nc (Figure 6(b)), which reveals that the\nproper value for Nc falls within the range 6 to 12 while it was\nin the range 8 to 15 from training dataset. This phenomenon\nreveals that the increase of cluster center numbers Nc may\nlead to the risk of overﬁtting on training dataset. Therefore,\nNc should fall within the range 8 to 12 in order to obtain better\ncomputation results on both datasets.\nComparison of the performance of both training and testing\ndatasets is shown in Figure 7, which indicates that the method\nFIGURE 7. Performance of the proposed method (Nc = 12, m = 1.2).\nworks well on testing dataset.

GENERALIZATION PERFORMANCE OF THE\nPROPOSED METHOD\nThe main feature of FCM-LR is the self-learning nature that\nfacilitates its application for different thermal aging condi-\ntions and oil-paper types. The aging experimental results\nobtained using the other two oil samples (mineral oil-2 and\npalm oil) are used to assess this adaptive feature. The per-\nformance of the proposed FCM-LR model is compared with\nthe performance of the principal component analysis linear\nregression (PCA-LR) proposed in [2]. Results of this compar-\nison are listed in Tables 5 and 6 and are plotted in Figure 8.\nEvaluation indicators listed in Tables 5 and 6 attest the high\naccuracy of the proposed method in estimating the DP value\nbased on multiple aging parameters when compared with the\ncurrent methods.\nFigure 8 shows the DP value predicted using PCA-LR and\nFCM-LR models for the 9 investigated samples of the two\ntypes of oil. As can been seen from Figure 8, the FCM-LR\nmodel has a better performance than the PCA-LR in estimat-\ning the DP values for various samples with a high degree of\nVOLUME 7, 2019 157477\nS.

Detailed DP values of the other aged OIP samples\nare listed in Tables 8 and 9 in the Appendix to compare the\nperformance of the proposed method in this paper with the\ncurrent methods in estimating the DP value based on one\nsingle parameter such as De Pablo’s equation. Results in the\ntables reveal the high accuracy of the proposed method when\ncompared with PCA-LR and De Pablo’s equation. These\nresults also reveal the suitability of the proposed method to\nbe adopted by various oil-paper samples.\nV. CONCLUSION\nThis paper proposes an FCM-LR method to predict the DP of\ntransformer paper insulation using multiple aging parameters\nof the transformer oil. Results show that the proposed method\nis more accurate than calculating the DP value based on\none single aging parameter such as 2-Fal as per the current\npractice. The proposed method features generalization per-\nformance that is examined on various oil-paper materials at\ndifferent thermal aging conditions. The good performance of\nthe proposed FCM-LR method makes it a powerful tool to\nestimate the DP value of transformer paper insulation with\nhigh degree of accuracy. The proposed technique can be\nautomated and built within future power equipment online\ncondition monitoring sensors to revel the condition of the\nsolid insulation in real time.\nAPPENDIX\nSee Tables 7–9.\nTABLE 8.
