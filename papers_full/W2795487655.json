INTRODUCTION \n \nAn MV/LV transformer substation transforms the medium \nvoltage supplied by the distribution network (e.g. 20 kV), \ninto voltage values suitable for the power supply of the low \nvoltage lines (e.g. 400 V). A substation is usually made of \nprefabricated concrete , steel or glass -fiber reinforced \npolyester and contains the transformer, the MV and LV \nswitchgear, the interconnections and auxiliary equipment and \ncircuits. A prefabricated substation is usually preferred owing \nto its ease of transportation, rapid on -site installation, and \ncompliance with standards.   \nThe service temperatures of transformer substations are \nspecified in the service conditions of the IEC 62271 -202 \nstandard [1]. The maximum temperature is 40 °C over  24 \nhours, except for extreme climates, where the range is from -\n50°C/+40°C for cold climates and -5°C/+50°C for very hot \nclimates. Other ventilation and air conditioning design \nspecifications for indoor substations require that the \ntemperature in areas fo r human activities should not exceed \n40° C and indoor temperature should not exceed 45° C [2]. \nThese climatic conditions along with the waste heat given off \nas a byproduct of transformer operation cause temperature \nrise in the substation. Since the temperatu re inside the \ntransformer tank directly depends on the surrounding air \ntemperature, excessive temperature increase inside the \nsubstation can reduce the operating life of the transformer by \nadversely affecting its insulation properties. Given the fact \nthat the transformer is the most expensive component in a \nsubstation, it becomes of utmost importance that this heat be \ndissipated.  This is done by the radiation exchanges with the \nsurrounding walls of the substation and more importantly by \nthe air circulating  by natural convection through the \nventilation grills of the substation and. However, at high \noutdoor temperatures the buoyancy -driven free convection is \nnot sufficient to remove the waste heat, and mechanical \nventilation is often used.  \nAssessing the ther mal behavior of a certain substation \ndesign is essential before the substation is fabricated and put \ninto service, especially when strict design limitations exist.  \nThis is because obtaining a top -oil temperature that exceeds \nthe permissible limits set by International Standards [1,3] \nafter actually implementing the design invalidates the design. \nIn this case, another design would be required. To avoid such \na time consuming and wasteful approach, methods based on \nmathematical models of substation ventilation designs can be \nused to study the thermal behavior in the designing phase \nprior to implementation. They are generally characterized by \ntheir versatility to test designs tailored to specific conditions \nand try scenarios involving the variation of load conditions or \nexternal factors such as environment temperature. The \nliterature classifies these methods into thermal circuit \nmethods and finite element methods.   \nA simple ventilation model for transformer substations \nwas proposed in [4]. The model is based on  two equations: \none equation for the heat transferred to the ventilation air and \na second equation for the heat dissipated through the walls of \nthe substation. The model takes as input the main parameters \nassociated with the ventilation performance of a su bstation \nsuch the power loss in the transformer and the dimensions of \nthe substation and outputs the estimates of the outflow air \nand the transformer mean temperature rise over the ambient \ntemperature. A limitation of this model is that it does not give \nthe enclosure class of the substation, as required by IEC \nstandard [1]. \nThe transient equivalent thermal circuit model developed \nin [5] represents an alternative approach to the thermal \nmodeling of transformer substations.  This model requires \nmeasurements o f the local temperature values in the \nsubstation and configuration of the ventilation grills \nconsidered. In [6], the same approach was improved by \naccounting for the temporal variation of the thermal \nInternational Journal of Heat and Technology \nVol. 36, No. 1, March, 2018, pp. 88-94 \n \nJournal homepage: http://iieta.org/Journals/IJHT \n \n88\n \nresistances and capacitances of the top -oil, of the vent ilation \nair and of the different components of the substation \nenclosure. A limitation of the transient equivalent thermal \ncircuit model is that it cannot be used to optimize the thermal \nperformance in the designing phase since it is based on \ndiscrete temperature measurements of an existing system.  \nA more comprehensive approach to ventilation that can \nhandle design and optimization objectives is the numerical \napproach. Numerical methods were used to validate the \nperformance of a ventilation system installed  in a mine [7], \npredict ventilation in underground hydropower stations [8], \nvalidate a design for uniform airflow distribution in duct \nventilation [9], and predict fire characteristics under various \nventilation conditions in an aircraft cargo compartment [ 10]. \nNumerical methods have been also used to study the thermal \nbehavior of a transformer substation. In [11], the finite \nelement method was used to solve the energy and the Navier-\nStokes equations in a flow domain corresponding to the air \ninside a transfo rmer substation. This approach permitted to \nanalyze the effect of the aperture of the ventilation grills, the \ntransformer load and the ambient temperature in the air \ntemperature distribution inside the substation. In [12], a \ndifferential model of the air c irculation and heat transfer was \ndeveloped for a half-buried transformer substation and solved \nby means of the finite volume method. This model is more \nrealistic than the model in [11], as it assumes a turbulent flow. \nThe model allows the enclosure class o f the substation to be \ndetermined and for the analysis of the air velocity and \ntemperature distributions. \n The aim of this paper is to investigate by CFD modeling \nthe performance of the air distribution system of a multi-zone \ntransformer room of an indoor substation located in Beirut. \nSeven ventilation schemes with different exhaust outlet \narrangements are pro posed while the position of air inlets is \nfixed. The best ventilation scheme is determined based on the \nanalysis and comparison of the predicted airflow and thermal \nfields.  \n \n \n2. PHYSICAL MODEL \n \nThe transformer room is 16.15 m long, 10.90 m wide, and \n11.30 m high and is divided into four zones each containing a \ntransformer of heat output 55 kW (Figure 1). The wall \npartitions are of height 3.5 m and thickness 0.15 m. For \nsafety purposes, four fire dampers that close in case of fire \nare fitted in the partitio ns between Zone 1 and Zone 3, and \nbetween Zone 2 and Zone 4. \n \n \n \nFigure 1. Plan view of the transformer room \nTwo 6 m (W) ×  4 m (H) air intake louvers are installed in \none of the room walls. The slats of the louvers are tilted \ndownwards at an angle of 25°  to prevent rainwater from \nentering the electrical room. From the energy balance, the \nventilation rate is estimated to be 27.4 kg/s for a design \noutdoor temperature of 37° C and assuming adiabatic walls to \ndisregard heat losses t o the outdoor air through walls. This \nconservative approach is used to minimize any possible \nunderestimation of indoor thermal fields in the numerical \nsimulations and thus have more confidence in the design \nrecommendations drawn from the CFD results. Four identical \nexhaust fans are used for ventilating the room and the air \noutlets are 2 m ×  1.5 m.  Seven air outlet arrangement \nschemes are proposed with the same position of air inlets. \nThe ventilation schemes are shown in Figure 2, where the \nfour air outlets  are mounted in the ceiling for Scheme a and \nwall mounted at elevations 8 m for Schemes b, c, d, and e, 5 \nm for Scheme f, and 3.6 m for Scheme g. \n \n \n3. CFD MODEL \n \nCFD has proven to be a powerful tool for the prediction of \nfluid and heat flows in indoor environments and has \nnumerous successful applications in the literature [12-15]. \nA detailed steady -state three -dimensional CFD model is \ndeveloped using ANSYS Fluent 15.0 [16] to predict the \nairflow patterns and thermal fields inside the transformer \nroom.  \nFor simplification purposes and in order to reduce the \nmesh size, the transformers are represented by cuboids of \ndimensions 3.5 m (L) ×  2.9 (W) ×  3 m (H). A tetrahedral \nmesh is used for the computational geometry with inflation at \nthe walls. The quality of  the mesh is ensured with a \nmaximum skewness less than 0.9. For grid independence test, \nthe number of cells is varied from 275,820 to 2,112,752 for \nthe case of Scheme a. It is found that the values of predicted \nair temperatures at the exhausts cease to cha nge drastically \n(variation less than 5%) after the cell count of 902,076. \nTherefore, the mesh size to be used for all simulation cases \nwill be in the same order to obtain accurate results at \nminimum computational cost.  \nThe standard k -epsilon model with st andard wall function \nis used to simulate turbulence. Buoyancy is modeled using \nthe ideal gas law.  The surface-to-surface (S2S) model is used \nto account for radiation [15]. This model calculates the \nenergy exchange in an enclosure of gray -diffuse surfaces.  \nThe energy reflected from a surface is computed using the \nabsolute temperature, emissivity, and reflectivity of that \nsurface and the energy flux incident on it from the \nsurroundings. The radiation exchange between two surfaces \ndepends on their size, separ ation distance, and orientation. \nThese parameters are taken into account using view factors \ncomputed by the CFD solver.  \nThe STANDARD discretization is used for the pressure \nterm, whereas the second -order discretization is used for the \ngoverning equations.  The velocity and pressure terms are \ncoupled using the SIMPLE scheme. The solution is \nconsidered convergent when the volume -average air \ntemperature in the lower zone is stabilized, the scaled \nresiduals reach 5× 10-5, and the net heat and mass balances are \nless than 1% of the minimum flux in the computational \ndomain. \n89\n \nFigure 2. Schematics of the proposed ventilation schemes \n \n \n4. MATHEMATICAL MODEL \n \nThe solver of ANSYS Fluent uses the finite volume \nmethod to solve the conservation equations of mass, \nmomentum, and energy. This method converts the partial \ndifferential equation into separate algebraic equations over \nelements or cells called finite volumes. The values of the \nflow p roperties such as velocity, pressure, and temperature \nare computed at the node of each cell of the computational \ngrid. \n \n4.1 Continuity equation \n \nThe flow field in the simulated space is governed by the \nbasic incompressible continuity equation: \n \n                (1)\n  \nWhere \n is the gradient operator and U is the velocity vector. \n \n4.2 Momentum equation \n \nFor each cell of the computational grid, the flow field is \ngoverned by the following steady -state diffe rential \nmomentum equation (Navier -Stokes equation) for \nincompressible flow: \n \n             (2) \n \nwhere p is the pressure, \nm  is the dynamic viscosity, and \nD is \nthe Laplace operator. \n \n4.3 Energy equation \n \nFor any infinitesimal control volume in the flow field, the \ndifferential energy equation for incompressible flow is \nexpressed at steady state as follows: \n \n               (3) \n \nwhere T is the temperature, \na  is the thermal diffusion \ncoefficient, and q is the heat generated per unit volume. \n \n \n5. BOUNDARY CONDITIONS \n \n5.1 Walls \n \nNo-slip condition is applied to all walls. This condition \nassumes that the air has zero velocity relative to the solid \nboundaries. A heat flux of 1,132.85 W/m 2 is attributed to \ntransformers’ walls while zero -heat flux is defined at other \nwalls to ignore any heat loss to the outside through them. \n \n5.2 Inlets and outlets \n \nPressure inlet boundary condition is imposed to the inlet \nlouvers with temperature of 37° C and inflow direction \nmaking an angle of 25°  with the horizontal. The outlets are \ndefined using exhaust fan boundary condition each with \ntarget mass flow rate 6.85 kg/s. \nThe boundary conditions are detailed in Table 1. \n \n \n \n \n \n90\n \nTable 1.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS \n \nThe CFD predictions of the indoor airflow and thermal \nfields are used to evaluate the performance of the ventilation \nsystem in use. In general, the convective heat transfer \nenhanced by mixing and back and forth motion of the air \nresults in effective heat removal and cooling effects and, as a \nresult, favors one ventilation scheme over another.   \nThe proposed ventilation schemes are assessed and \ncompared based on the predicted volume -averaged air \ntemperatures in the operating zone and in the vicinity of each \ntransformer presented in Table 2. The operating zone extends \nfrom the floor to the height of 3.5 m and the vicinity of a \ntransformer is defined as the region surrounding the \ntransformer at a distance of 0.5 m (rectangular microclimate). \nTable 3 shows the p redicted average surface temperatures of \nthe transformers for each ventilation scheme.   \nThe air velocity distributions on horizontal sampling plane \n(z = 1.5 m) are shown in Figure 3. The thermal fields at z = \n1.5 m and at a cut plane (x = 4.45 m) are presented in Figures \n4 and 5, respectively. \nThree-dimensional air streamlines for each case are also \npresented in Figure 6 to analyze and better understand the \nadvantages and disadvantages of each proposed ventilation \nscheme. Results show that Scheme g exhibit s the best \nperformance yielding a volume -averaged air temperature of \n39.0° C in the operating zone and 41.1 – 41.6° C in the \nproximities of transformers. \n \nTable 2.

Top view of 3D streamline charts for all proposed schemes \n92\n6.1 Scheme a \n \nThe ventilation air jets strike the transformers in Area A, \nwhich cools down their surfaces and destroys the thermal \nplumes that they develop (Figures 5.a, 6.a). The surrounding \nair is carried by the ventilation air toward the ceiling where it \nis vented ou t. The significant cooling effects induced by the \nsubstantial air movement in Area A make the air temperature \nin the vicinity of Transformers 1 and 2 within the acceptable \nrange. In Area B, however, there is no direct contact of \nventilation air with the tr ansformers because of the partitions \nblocking the flow (Figure 3.a). Here, rising plumes are \nestablished above the transformers and they mix with the \nroom air at high elevations in the proximity of exhaust outlets. \nThis airflow pattern results in poor cool ing performance in \nArea B as shown in Figure 4.a since heat from transformers \ndisplaces mainly by radiation and unforced convection. \n \n6.2 Scheme b \n \nAs indicated in Figure 6.b and Figure 3.b, the ventilation \njets carry the surrounding air toward Area B pass ing by the \ntransformers in Area A and cooling them down. All exhaust \noutlets are in Area B and at a level lower than the ceiling \nlevel which results in better heat removal than in Scheme a. \nThe bulk of the airflow that reaches Area B is immediately \nvented out conveying the warm air that rises buoyantly from \nthe vicinity of the transformers in that area (Figure 5.b). This \nexplains the significant drop in predicted air temperatures \nwithin Area B when compared with those of Scheme a \n(Figure 4.b).  \n \n6.3 Scheme c  \n \nThe advantage of this scheme over Scheme b is that not all \nexhaust outlets are positioned in Area B. In fact, the \nexistence of two outlets in Area A allows the forth and back \nmotion of the air providing better cooling effect. This \nexplains the lower pr edictions of average air temperature in \nthe operating area for Scheme c as shown in Figure 4.c and \nFigure 5.c. \n \n6.3 Scheme d \n \nAs shown in Figure 6.d, a part of the airflow is \nimmediately exhausted from the space through the sidewall \noutlets without removin g much heat and the remainder is \ncarried to Area B. In this area, two vortices are developed \nbetween the sidewalls of the transformers and the wall \npartition forming two dead zones (Figure 3.d) that lead to \nhigher predicted values of air temperature in the  operating \narea when compared with Schemes b and c as shown in \nFigure 4.d and Figure 5.d. \n \n6.4 Scheme e \n \nAs indicated in Figure 4.e and Figure 5.e, Scheme e \nexhibits good cooling effects with acceptable predictions of \nair temperature in operating area. Figure 6.e shows that the \nventilation air reaches Area B and is either vented out \nthrough the outlets on the opposite side of the inlet louvers or \ncircles backwards and flows to the outlets mounted above the \nlouvers. This remarkable mixing pattern of the airflow \nfacilitates ventilation and hence ensures satisfactory ranges of \nair temperature in the operating area. \n \n6.5 Schemes f and g \n \nResults reveal that Scheme c has the best cooling effect \ncompared with Schemes a, b, c, d, and e. The same \nconfiguration of exhaust outlets used in Scheme c is proposed \nin Schemes f and g, except that the elevation of the outlets i s \nvaried. While the elevation was 8 m in Scheme c, it is \nchanged to be 5 m for Scheme f and 3.5 m for Scheme g. As \nshown in Figure 3.f and Figure 3.g, air velocity is greater in \nthe operating zone when the exhaust outlets are located at \nlower elevations, which enhances the convective heat transfer \nat the sides of transformers and then results in lower air \ntemperature levels in the operating zone. Moreover, when an \noutlet is located just above the transformer, the latter’s \nthermal plume is vented out before expanding and mixing \nwith the indoor air (Figure 6.g).  Scheme g is then the best -\nproposed scenario providing the best cooling effects in the \noperating zone as shown in Figure 4.g and Figure 5.g. \n \n \n7. CONCLUSIONS \n \nAn indoor multi -zone substation with four transformers \nwas simulated using ANSYS/Fluent 15.0 with different \nproposed ventilation schemes. The location of inlet louvers is \nfix, while the positions of four exhaust outlets were changed \nthroughout the CFD simu lations in order to determine the \nbest-case scenario providing the lowest levels of air \ntemperatures in the operating zone and in the vicinity of \ntransformers. The following conclusions were drawn from \nthe performed analysis: \n1. Scheme a with four ceiling -mounted exhaust fans \nwas the worst case as predicted air temperatures reached the \nhighest levels exceeding 60° C in the vicinity of transformers \nin Area B.  \n2. It is recommended to locate two exhaust fans on the \nwall facing the inlet louvers and the other two fan s on the \nadjacent walls within Area A.  This configuration provides \nsafe and acceptable ranges of air temperature in the operating \nzone and also in the neighborhood of all transformers. The \nanalysis showed that the cooling effect improves as the \nelevation of the exhaust fans decreases. \n \n \nREFERENCES  \n \n[1] IEC 62271 -202. ( 2006).
