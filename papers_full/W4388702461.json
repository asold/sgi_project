  "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have become prominent tools in various domains, such as natural language processing, machine translation, and the development of creative text. Nevertheless, in order to fully exploit the capabilities of Language Models, it is imperative to establish efficient communication channels between humans and machines. The discipline of engineering involves the creation of well-constructed and informative prompts, which act as a crucial link between human intention and the execution of tasks by machines. The present study examines the concept of rapid engineering, elucidating its underlying concepts, methodologies, and diverse range of practical applications.",
