Drought resistance is a complex quantitative trait controlled\nby many genes. Thus, introgression of drought resistance traits into high yielding\ngenotypes has been a challenge to plant breeders. Vegetable grafting using rootstocks\nhas emerged as a rapid tool in tailoring plants to better adapt to suboptimal growing\nconditions. This has induced changes in shoot physiology. Grafting applications have\nexpanded mainly in Solanaceous crops and cucurbits, which are commonly grown in\narid and semi-arid areas characterized by long drought periods. The current review gives\nan overview of the recent scientiﬁc literature on root-shoot interaction and rootstock-\ndriven alteration of growth, yield, and fruit quality in grafted vegetable plants under\ndrought stress. Further, we elucidate the drought resistance mechanisms of grafted\nvegetables at the morpho-physiological, biochemical, and molecular levels.\nKeywords: antioxidative defense system, Cucurbitaceae, molecular mechanism, root–shoot interaction,\nrootstock, Solanaceae, water stress\nINTRODUCTION\nGlobally, the demand for vegetables is increasing. Their cultivation has thus extended, especially\nin semi-arid and arid regions where recurrent drought and water shortages are quite common\n(Rouphael et al., 2012).\nDrought depresses plant growth due to decreased cellular water potential and stomatal\nconductance, inhibition of photosynthesis, and enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS)\naccumulation. This causes heavy and economically relevant yield losses (Altunlu and Gul, 2012; Liu\net al., 2014). Thus, it is a considerable challenge to develop scientiﬁc strategies for minimizing yield\nlosses under drought conditions (Cantero-Navarro et al., 2016), to increase water use eﬃciency\n(WUE) of crops. WUE is deﬁned as the ratio of the CO 2 assimilation rate and transpiration rate\n(instantaneous WUE), or the ratio of crop yield over the applied water (yield WUE). Grafting has\nemerged as a potential tool to quickly enhance the eﬃciency of modern vegetable cultivars for\nwider adaptability or resistance to diﬀerent stresses when these are grafted onto resistant rootstocks\nfor speciﬁc stresses (Colla et al., 2010b, 2011, 2012, 2013; Kumar et al., 2015a,b; Rouphael et al.,\n2016). In spite of widespread use of grafting in dealing with soil-borne diseases, recent research has\nFrontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org 1 June 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 1130\nfpls-08-01130 June 30, 2017 Time: 11:47 # 2\nKumar et al. Vegetable Grafting and Drought Resistance\ndemonstrated its potential in alleviating abiotic factors such as\ndrought stress in diﬀerent fruiting vegetables belonging to the\nSolanaceae and Cucurbitaceae families (Schwarz et al., 2010).\nUnderstanding how grafting minimizes the eﬀects of drought\nis a basic requirement for the continued success of this technique.\nThe present article provides an updated review of scientiﬁc\nadvances addressing grafting eﬀects under drought conditions\nof fruiting vegetables and discusses the mechanisms that may\nmediate these eﬀects.\nAGRONOMIC RESPONSES OF GRAFTED\nPLANTS TO DROUGHT STRESS\nDrought resistance can be categorized as constitutive (also\nexpressed under well-watered conditions) or drought-responsive\n(expressed only under pronounced water deﬁcit) (Boopathi,\n2012). Drought responsive traits aﬀect yield only under severe\nwater-stressed conditions while constitutive traits can inﬂuence\nyield at low and intermediate degrees of drought as well\n(Tuberosa, 2012). In a recent study, Liu et al. (2016) reported\nthat luﬀa ( Luﬀa cylindrica Roem. cv. Xiangfei No. 236)\nrootstock resulted in higher shoot growth (i.e., leaf area and\ndry weight) and instantaneous WUE, when grafted with its\nown scion or with cucumber ( Cucumis sativus L. cv. Jinyan\nNo. 4). Furthermore, it also showed delayed leaf wilting under\nwater deﬁcit conditions. Since no signiﬁcant diﬀerences were\nobserved on leaf area and plant dry weight between grafted and\nnon-grafted plants under well-watered conditions, rootstock-\ninduced drought resistance was probably the result of drought-\nadaptive response. Moreover, the use of reciprocal grafting\nbetween drought-tolerant luﬀa rootstock and sensitive cucumber\nindicated that plant resistance to drought was mainly dependent\non luﬀa rootstock. Using reciprocal grafting between the drought-\ntolerant “Zarina” and sensitive “Joseﬁna” tomato ( Solanum\nlycopersicum L.) genotypes, Sánchez-Rodríguez et al. (2012a,b,\n2013) reported that increased tolerance in grafted plants to\nmoderate water deﬁcit was a drought-adaptive response mainly\nrelated to tolerant rootstock, which provided better plant growth\nand yield. Moreover, Altunlu and Gul (2012) demonstrated\nthat when the interspeciﬁc hybrid “Beaufort” ( S. lycopersicum\nL. ×S. habrochaites S. Knapp and D. M. Spooner) was used\nas rootstock, it mitigated the growth depression of tomato\nplants induced by water stress, compared with tomato grafted\nonto weak root structure rootstock (“Resistar”) or self-grafted\nplants. Such ﬁndings indicate a drought-adaptive response\nof tomato grafted onto “Beaufort” rootstock. Comparing 144\ntomato lines as rootstocks for grafting tomato “Boludo F 1, ”\nAlbacete et al. (2015) found that 38% of lines exhibited\nhigher shoot fresh weight compared to self-grafted plants under\nwater deﬁcit conditions. This ﬁnding conﬁrmed that drought-\ninduced growth inhibition in tomato can be alleviated by\ngrafting. Similar to tomato, the marketable yield of greenhouse\npepper ( Capsicum annuum L. cv. Verset) was improved only\nunder water-stressed conditions (drought-adaptive response)\nwhen grafted onto the rootstocks “Atlante, ” “PI-15225, ” and\n“ECU-973.” This was aﬀected by their ability to maintain\nnet photosynthetic rate under deﬁcit irrigation (Penella et al.,\n2014a).\nRootstock-induced drought resistance can be the result of\na constitutive response, also expressed under well-watered\nconditions. Ibrahim et al. (2014) and Al-Harbi et al. (2016)\nreported an increase of yield and yield WUE in tomato cv.\nFaridah grafted onto the interspeciﬁc tomato hybrid “Unifort”\n(S. lycopersicum L. × S. pimpinellifolium L.), grown under\nboth full and deﬁcit irrigation regimes. A constitutive response\nof grafted plants (such as watermelon) to drought was also\nreported by Rouphael et al. (2008). They found higher\nmarketable fruit yield ( +60%) and yield WUE ( +10%) in\npumpkin rootstock ( Cucurbita maxima Duch. ×C. moschata\nDuch.; cv. PS1313) grafted mini-watermelon [ Citrullus lanatus\n(Thunb.) Matsum. and Nakai; cv. Ingrid] than non-grafted\ncontrol, under full and deﬁcit irrigation regimes. López-Marín\net al. (2017) studied the morpho-physiological responses of\ngreenhouse sweet pepper cv. Herminio non-grafted or grafted\nonto three hybrid rootstocks, “Atlante, ” “Creonte, ” and “Terrano, ”\nunder two irrigation regimes (100% or 50% of ETc). Pepper\nyield was higher in the three grafting combinations than\nin non-grafted plants, regardless of the irrigation regime\nused (constitutive response). Among the diﬀerent rootstocks,\n“Creonte” was the most eﬀective in improving yield and yield\nWUE of grafted plants. This experiment resulted in 25% higher\nmarketable yield than non-grafted plants and ∼10% higher\nyield than the other two rootstocks. “Creonte” signiﬁcantly\nincreased the harvest index at both irrigation regimes in\ncomparison with non-grafted plants without aﬀecting shoot\nbiomass. These ﬁndings indicated that “Creonte”-mediated\nincrease in the partition of biomass to reproductive organs of\ngrafted plants was the major trait associated with the improved\nperformance of these plants under both irrigation regimes.\nThe research ﬁndings of Penella et al. (2014a) and López-\nMarín et al. (2017), demonstrated that “Atlante” rootstock\nbehaved diﬀerently depending on the cultivar used as the\nscion: a drought-adaptive response in the Atlante/Verset grafting\ncombination and a constitutive response in the Atlante/Herminio\ngrafting combination. The authors concluded that each graft\ncombination has to be tested for drought tolerance, as both\nrootstocks as well as scion genotypes aﬀect growth and yield\nresponse.\nPetran (2013) reported that use of turkey berry rootstock\n(S. torvum Swartz) under water-stressed conditions induced\ndwarfness in tomato scions (“Celebrity” and “3212”) and delayed\nwilting, especially with “3212.” Similarly, grafting tomato cv.\n“BHN602” onto the tomato rootstock “Jjak Kkung” reduced the\nplant growth and leaf area under well-watered conditions in\ncomparison with non-grafted or grafted plants BHN602/Cheong\nGang (Nilsen et al., 2014). However, under drought conditions,\nthe decrease in plant biomass and leaf area in BHN602/Jjak\nKkung combination was less pronounced in comparison with\nnon-grafted or grafted plants BHN602/Cheong Gang. The above\nﬁndings indicate that the increase in drought resistance in\ntomato scions grafted onto turkey berry rootstock or tomato\nrootstock “Jjak Kkung” represents a drought-avoidance response.\nThis characteristics has limited agronomic value because\nFrontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org 2 June 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 1130\nfpls-08-01130 June 30, 2017 Time: 11:47 # 3\nKumar et al. Vegetable Grafting and Drought Resistance\ngrowth reduction (especially leaf area reduction), constitutively\ninduced by rootstock, is often associated with lower yield\npotential.\nThe above research ﬁndings demonstrate that vigor (greater\nproduction of above-ground biomass in a short time) and high\nbiomass partitioning in fruits (harvest index) are the major\ncrop constitutive traits associated with high yield potential\nof watermelon (Ingrid/PS1313; Supplementary Figure S1 )\nand pepper (Herminio/Creonte) grafted plants in both well-\nwatered and drought stress conditions. As these traits are\nalso expressed under well-watered conditions, it is possible\nto screen grafting combinations for vigor, harvest index, and\nyield in trials, where plants are grown only under a regular\nirrigation regime. Drought-adaptive response has been also\nreported in trials on cucumber, pepper, and tomato, and\nis often associated with a mitigation of yield decline only\nunder severe water-stressed conditions. However, as areas\nunder vegetable production are more likely to witness mild\nwater shortage rather than severe water stress, it seems more\npromising to increase the phenotyping traits that constitutively\nenhance yield per se rather than plant survival under extreme\ndrought.\nFruit quality of vegetable crops is also signiﬁcantly aﬀected by\ngrafting combinations and water availability. Sánchez-Rodríguez\net al. (2012a,b, 2013) reported that grafting sensitive “Joseﬁna”\ntomato genotype onto drought-tolerant “Zarina” rootstock\nimproved fruit quality, particularly with regard to sugars and\norganic acids, the ratio of sugar to acid, minerals (Ca, K,\nand Mg), lycopene, β-carotene, total ﬂavonoids and rutin,\nunder water-stressed conditions. However, other researchers\n(Turhan et al., 2011; Al-Harbi et al., 2016) have reported a\ndecrease in fruit quality traits (vitamin C, titratable acidity, and\ntotal soluble solids) of grafted tomato plants. The disparities\nin the results regarding the eﬀect of grafting on sweetness,\nacidity, and functional compounds may reﬂect the eﬀects of\ndiﬀerent grafting combinations and environmental conditions\non photosynthesis, source:sink ratio, water relationships, and\nfruit ripening time (Rouphael et al., 2010; Kyriacou et al.,\n2017).\nFor watermelon, Rouphael et al. (2008) reported an\nimprovement of some fruit quality parameters (titratable\nacidity, K, and Mg) in pumpkin rootstock ( Cucurbita\nmaxima Duch. × C. moschata Duch.; cv. PS1313) grafted\nmini-watermelon ( Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. and\nNakai; cv. Ingrid) than non-grafted control under full and\ndeﬁcit irrigation regimes. Moreover, antioxidant compounds\n(vitamin C and lycopene) in mini-watermelon were also higher\nin Ingrid/PS1313 grafting combination than in non-grafted\ncontrol, irrespective of the irrigation regime used (Proietti\net al., 2008). When averaged over irrigation regime, “Creonte”\nrootstock showed improved physical quality parameters\n(ﬁrmness) but reduced fruit nutritional value (vitamin C,\nantioxidant capacity, and total phenolic compounds) of pepper\ncultivar “Herminio, ” compared to non-grafted plants. The\nabove ﬁndings indicate that fruit quality attributes need to be\nconsidered during the selection process of drought resistance\ngrafting combinations. This is true especially for watermelon\nand melon, where quality attributes such as total soluble solids\ndetermine sensory quality, and thereby, consumer acceptance\n(i.e., marketability).\nA summary of the main agronomic eﬀects of grafted plants\nin comparison to non-grafted or self-grafted plants in vegetable\ncrops grown under full and deﬁcit irrigation regimes is reported\nin Table 1.\nMECHANISMS OF DROUGHT\nRESISTANCE IN GRAFTED PLANTS\nRoot System Characteristics\nA deep root system has shown beneﬁcial eﬀects on plant\nproduction and survival by acquiring water stored in deeper\nsoil layers, thus leading to more drought tolerance (Koevoets\net al., 2016). Plants often reallocate assimilates from shoot\ngrowth to root growth under water-stressed conditions, thereby\nenhancing root extension into deeper soil layers (Xu et al.,\n2015). A strong and an extensive deep root system of pumpkin\nrootstock was a major contributor of drought resistance in grafted\n“Charleston Gray” watermelon (Poor, 2015). Similarly, López-\nMarín et al. (2017) found higher root growth in the drought-\ntolerant grafted sweet pepper plant Atlante/Herminio than\nin non-grafted pepper plant “Herminio” under an irrigation-\ndeﬁcient regime, which was associated with a higher leaf water\ncontent. In tomato, the use of drought-tolerant cv. Zarina as\nrootstocks for cv. Joseﬁna increased root dry biomass and root\nmetabolic eﬃciency, in comparison to self-grafted plants when\nwater stress was imposed by reducing the irrigation to 50%\nof ﬁeld capacity (Sánchez-Rodríguez et al., 2014). Recently, an\nintrogression line (IL, “LA3957”) used as rootstock for grafting\ntomato resulted in a higher root dry matter and root to shoot\nratio, besides showing better resistance to drought stress than\nself-grafted plants (Poudyala et al., 2015). Hence, we emphasize\nthe importance of selecting grafting combinations that are able\nto develop a deep and vigorous root system, and of increasing\nthe root to shoot ratio. Moreover, root anatomical characteristics\n(e.g., vessel size and density) and rooting hydraulic conductance\nmay also play a pivotal role in increasing drought resistance of\ngrafted plants. However, the use of roots as selection criteria of\ndrought-resistance grafting combinations has a major limitation\ndue to the diﬃculty of phenotyping root traits under ﬁeld\nconditions.\nPhysiological and Biochemical\nMechanisms\nNutrient Uptake and Assimilation\nIt is well established that water stress decreases the plant\nionome by restricting uptake and translocation of mineral\nnutrients owing to restricted transpiration rate and reduced\nactive transport and membrane permeability (Sánchez-Rodríguez\net al., 2013, 2014). Many rootstocks are capable of increasing\nthe uptake and translocation of nutrients (Savvas et al., 2010).\nThe increased fruit yield and yield WUE in grafted mini-\nwatermelon plants under full and deﬁcit irrigation regimes\nFrontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org 3 June 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 1130\nfpls-08-01130 June 30, 2017 Time: 11:47 # 4\nKumar et al.

Vegetable Grafting and Drought Resistance\nwas partly due to the rootstock-mediated increased nutrient\nstatus of plants (i.e., N, K, and Mg; Rouphael et al., 2008).\nAccumulation of macro and micronutrients (N, P , K, Fe, and\nCu) in susceptible tomato scion “Joseﬁna” increased when\ngrafted onto drought-tolerant “Zarina” rootstocks (Sánchez-\nRodríguez et al., 2014). Working with similar plants, Sánchez-\nRodríguez et al. (2013) concluded that drought-tolerant rootstock\ncould improve absorption, upward transfer, and accumulation\nof NO 3− in tomato scion, thus stimulating nitrate reductase\n(NR) activity and NO 3−assimilation. Consequently, improved\ngrowth of grafted plants under moderate water stress was\nnoted. Penella et al. (2014b) also observed that the NR\nactivity in leaves of pepper plants increased when grafted\nonto tolerant rootstocks. The increase of nutrient uptake in\ndrought resistance grafting combinations can be related to\nthe considerable soil exploration resulting from the deep and\nvigorous root system, and the enhanced root exudation of\norganic acids into the soil, which contribute to the release of\nnutrients (e.g., P and Fe) more eﬃciently in the rhizosphere\n(Colla et al., 2010a). However, it may also be possible\nthat rootstocks enhance nutrient transporters in the plasma\nmembrane, thus increasing the capacity of grafted plants to take\nup nutrients.\nPhotosynthetic Efﬁciency and Water Relations\nIncreased WUE of grafted plants relative to non-grafted or\nself-grafted plants is often related to increases in net CO 2\nassimilation rate, or reduced transpiration rate, or both (Khah\net al., 2011). In luﬀa rootstock-grafted cucumber, increased\ninstantaneous WUE over self-grafted cucumber was due\nto a higher CO 2 assimilation rate and lower transpiration\nrate in comparison to self-grafted plants under drought\nstress (Liu et al., 2016). Apart from stomatal movement,\nrootstock-induced changes in stomatal development also\naﬀects water conservation in grafted cucumber, as reduced\ntranspiration relates to lower stomatal density in grafted\nplants (Liu et al., 2016). Compared to self-rooted mini-\nwatermelon, the higher yield and yield WUE in grafted plants\nwas due to their higher net CO 2 assimilation rate, along\nwith their eﬃciency in acquiring more water (high crop\nevapotranspiration) and nutrients from soil (Rouphael et al.,\n2008).\nDrought resistance of grafted tomato plants onto rootstock\n“Beaufort” was due to improved osmoregulation, partially\ninduced by higher proline content, and relative water content in\ntomato scion under water stress (Altunlu and Gul, 2012). Though\nnet CO 2 assimilation rate decreased in polyethylene glycol\n(PEG)-induced water stress, rootstock-grafted pepper seedlings\nmaintained the protective capacity of the photosynthetic\nmachinery mediated by osmotic adjustment (based on higher\nproline content; Penella et al., 2014b). Potassium plays a\ncrucial role in osmoregulation and confers drought tolerance\n(Kafkaﬁ and Xu, 1999). Sánchez-Rodríguez et al. (2014)\nobserved an increase in the K-concentration under water-stressed\nconditions only in drought-tolerant rootstock-grafted plants\n(Zarina/Joseﬁna) and non-grafted “Zarina, ” which might have\ncontributed to better osmotic adjustment under stress conditions.\nOther than osmotic adjustment, grafted plants can maintain\nhigh leaf water potential under water-stressed conditions through\ndrought avoidance mechanisms as reported by Nilsen et al. (2014)\nin tomato. In a former study, increased drought resistance in\nBHN602/Jjak Kkung grafting combination was observed to be the\nFIGURE 1 | Physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying drought resistance in grafted cucumber and tomato plants.\nFrontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org 6 June 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 1130\nfpls-08-01130 June 30, 2017 Time: 11:47 # 7\nKumar et al. Vegetable Grafting and Drought Resistance\nresult of a water conservation strategy, based on the combination\nof growth reduction (reducing leaf area) and the ability to\nmaintain net photosynthesis at lower water potentials. Similarly,\nan introgression line (IL, “LA3957”), used as rootstock for\ngrafting tomato, resulted in a decrease of stomatal conductance\nin response to drought stress, so as to maintain leaf turgor\n(Poudyala et al., 2015). Moreover, the same graft combination\nshowed higher stomatal conductance a few hours after the\ndrought stress cycle break, allowing a rapid recovery of net\nassimilation. Furthermore, tomato plants (cv. Known-You 301)\nmaintained higher leaf water potential and net photosynthesis\nwhen grafted onto Solanum mammosum, rather than self-grafted\nplants because of the higher hydraulic conductivity from roots to\nleaves (Weng, 2000). Overall drought resistance in some grafting\ncombinations is achieved through a variety of adaptive traits\ninvolving the minimization of water loss (i.e., better control\nof stomatal movement and reduction of stomatal density) and\noptimization of water uptake (i.e., greater osmotic adjustment).\nTherefore, drought resistance-grafting combinations are able to\ncarefully balance the ratio between uptake and loss of water in\norder to mitigate the detrimental eﬀects of drought on net CO 2\nassimilation rate.\nAntioxidative Defense System\nGrafting with drought-tolerant rootstock can improve scion\nperformance by regulating the antioxidant system under drought\nstress (Liu et al., 2014). The higher activity of antioxidant\nenzymes [superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT)]\nand lower oxidative stressors (hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2)\nand malondialdehyde (MDA) content) from drought-tolerant\ntomato genotype “Zarina” (either grafted or self-rooted),\nindicate its greater ability to maintain cellular homeostasis,\nconferring plant drought resistance. Apart from SOD and\nCAT, increased levels of polyamines also displayed improved\ndrought resistance mechanisms of grafted plants under\nwater-stressed conditions (Sánchez-Rodríguez et al., 2016).\nSuch mechanisms included acting as direct ROS scavenger,\nor scavenging free radicals through binding to antioxidant\nenzyme molecules (Groppa and Benavides, 2008). Luﬀa\nrootstock-grafted cucumber experienced lower stress than\nits self-grafted counterpart (Liu et al., 2016), possibly by\ninducing higher antioxidative enzymatic activities [e.g., SOD,\ndehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR) and guaiacol peroxidase\n(GPOD)] and ROS scavenging. Further, they presumed that\nresistance of luﬀa rootstock in grafted cucumber was also due to\na partial contribution of abscisic acid (ABA) in ROS scavenging\nactivity, possibly through ABA signaling and regulation of\nantioxidant reaction in response to drought. Nevertheless,\nincreased H 2O2 accumulation (in stomata) could possibly\nplay a signaling role in rapid stomatal closure (Liu et al.,\n2016).\nHormonal Signaling\nAbscisic acid is probably the most researched and crucial\nphytohormone inﬂicting shoot water relation via root-to-shoot\nsignaling under water stress. Upward ABA transfer from\nroots to shoots inﬂuences transpiration rate (Wilkinson and\nDavies, 2002). Rootstocks with enhanced capacity for ABA\nbiosynthesis or sensitivity can increase WUE and productivity\nof grafted scion under water stress (Liu et al., 2016).\nLuﬀa rootstock enhances instantaneous WUE of cucumber\nscion under drought stress. This was associated with the\nimproved ability of luﬀa roots to sense changes in root-\nzone moisture, leading to a modest level of upward ABA\ntransfer (Liu et al., 2016). Cantero-Navarro et al. (2016)\nobserved that rootstock-mediated ABA was positively correlated\nwith scion photosynthetic parameters and instantaneous WUE.\nHowever, ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic\nacid (ACC) was negatively correlated with leaf growth and water\nuse, but did not limit fruit yield. Hence, yield WUE in grafted\ntomato plants showed a marked increase. Reciprocal grafting\nstudy with ABA-deﬁcient mutants ( ﬂacca) demonstrated that\nincreased leaf area of scion/rootstock ( ﬂacca/wild-type parent;\nWT) over ﬂacca self-grafts was not related to increased leaf-\nwater relations. It was rather associated with the normalization\nof shoot ethylene relations, and possibly, direct promotion\nof growth by root-synthesized ABA (Dodd et al., 2009).\nMoreover, grafting experiments in tomato have postulated that\nrootstock-mediated regulation of stomatal conductance by ABA\nsignaling may have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on tomato production\nunder drought conditions (Nilsen et al., 2014). The role of\nother hormones classes (e.g., auxins, cytokinin, brassinosteroids,\njasmonic acid, and salicylic acid) in regulating WUE by\ninﬂuencing plant water relation (Acharya and Assmann, 2009)\nunder drought stress has yet to be clariﬁed in grafted fruiting\nvegetables.\nMolecular Mechanisms\nLiu et al. (2016) reported quantitative analyses of expression\nlevels of the ABA signaling-related gene in water-stressed\ngrafted and self-grafted cucumber plants. They observed a\nhigher up-regulation in transcripts of the ABA receptors\ngenes (PYL1, PYL2, PYL5, and PYL8), ABA transporter gene\n(ABCG22), ABA signaling-related genes (SnRK2.4 and SnRK2.5),\nand ABA-dependent genes (RAB18 and RD29B). Higher\ndown-regulation of a negative regulator gene of ABA signaling\n(PP2C1) was also observed in drought-tolerant cucumber, grafted\nonto luﬀa rootstock, than drought sensitive self-graft cucumber.\nThe above ﬁndings were in agreement with the increased ABA\naccumulation and cellular sensitivity to ABA in grafted plants\n(Liu et al., 2016). Therefore, it can be inferred that increased\nsensitivity of stomatal movement to ABA and water stress was\nassociated with increased ABA accumulation and induction of\nthe transcripts of ABA signaling genes. There is a need to study\nthe function and implication of some other genes involved in\naccumulation of osmolytes, detoxiﬁcation of ROS, and so on\n(Albacete et al., 2014), to decipher drought resistance in grafted\nplants.\nCONCLUSION\nThe scientiﬁc literature reviewed here suggests that grafting\ncan eﬃciently mitigate the adverse eﬀects of drought on shoots\nFrontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org 7 June 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 1130\nfpls-08-01130 June 30, 2017 Time: 11:47 # 8\nKumar et al. Vegetable Grafting and Drought Resistance\nof elite cultivar and increase WUE. Reported mechanisms for\ndrought resistance of grafted plants ( Figure 1) can bring about\nmodiﬁcations in: (1) root traits [a deeper and more extensive\nroot system, higher root hydraulic conductance, faster induction\nof hormone accumulation (like ABA)]; (2) scion-rootstock\ncommunication (water, nutrient, and hormonal ﬂow); (3) scion\nmorpho-physiological characteristics (increase in harvest index,\ndecrease in leaf growth, reduction in stomata density, better\nosmoregulation, higher antioxidant activity, etc.). Selection of\ngrafting combinations that constitutively increase morpho-\nphysiological traits (e.g., scion vigor, harvest index, root growth,\nroot hydraulic conductance, and nutrient uptake) associated with\nhigh yield potential, oﬀers the most promising strategy to increase\ndrought resistance in Solanaceous crops and Cucurbits under\nmild water-stressed conditions. Under extreme water-stressed\nconditions, a combination of constitutive and adaptive traits in\ngrafting combinations could be ideally considered for improving\ndrought resistance.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nPK wrote the ﬁrst draft of the manuscript; YR improved the\nmanuscript and especially the agronomic part, MC improved the\nmanuscript and especially the physiological part; GC supervised\nto the preparation of the manuscript and gave a substantial\ncontribution in improving the diﬀerent parts.\nSUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL\nThe Supplementary Material for this article can be found online\nat: http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpls.2017.01130/\nfull#supplementary-material\nFIGURE S1 | Early vigor of non-grafted (A; cv.
