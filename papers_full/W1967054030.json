Not only social planners, but also the\nmembers of society themselves care about the fairness and inequality of payoff distri-\nbutions. Fehr and Schmidt (1999, FS from now on) introduced a social utility function\nthat captures concerns about fairness in the sense of inequity aversion. Individuals\ndislike both being worse off than others, and others being worse off than themselves.\nNevertheless, the latter is not very extreme, so that when all others receive nothing an\nindividual does still want to maximize the own payoff. This paper gives a preference\nfoundation of (exactly) FS.\nThe author would like to thank Marc Fleurbaey, Itzhak Gilboa, Ingrid M. T. Rohde, Klaus M. Schmidt,\nPeter P .

Rohde\nVirtually every major utility theory in economics has received its own preference\nfoundation. One famous example is Koopmans (1960), who provided a preference\nfoundation for discounted utility in intertemporal choice. Other examples include\nArtzner et al. (1999) for coherent measures of risk, Gilboa and Schmeidler (1989)\nfor ambiguity and multiple priors, Harsanyi (1955) for utilitarianism, Savage (1954)\nfor expected utility and Bayesian statistics, Schmeidler (1989) for nonexpected\nutility, Tversky and Kahneman (1992) for (cumulative) prospect theory, and von\nNeumann and Morgenstern (1944) for expected utility. Preference foundations give\nbehavioral conditions that are necessary and sufﬁcient for a model to hold. These\nconditions state the empirical meaning of a model in terms of observables. In empir-\nical applications the model holds if and only if the behavioral conditions hold and\nit fails if and only if at least one of the behavioral conditions fails. Normatively,\nthe model can be justiﬁed if one agrees that behavior should follow the behav-\nioral conditions; it can be criticized otherwise. Thus, a preference foundation allows\nfor the veriﬁcation of the empirical validity and the normative appropriateness of a\nmodel.\nSome recent studies provided preference foundations for models more general than\nFS ( Neilson 2006 ; Sandbu 2008 ). From these preference foundations it does not fol-\nlow how we can verify whether preferences satisfy exactly the model of FS. Although\nthese papers provide necessary conditions for FS to hold, they do not provide sufﬁcient\nconditions and therefore do not exactly identify FS’s empirical content. In particular,\nthey do not achieve the exceptionally good balance between parsimony and ﬁt of FS’s\nmodel.\nNeilson (2006) considers general nonlinear utility of payoff differences between\none individual and the others. He allows for, but does not identify a key feature of\nFS: that disadvantageous inequity is treated differently from advantageous inequity.\nNeilson’s key condition is self-referent separability, which is similar to standard sepa-\nrability, but which treats one component, the payoff of the decision maker, differently.\nThis self-referent separability is not sufﬁcient to characterize FS, because it neither\ndifferentiates between advantageous and disadvantageous inequity, nor does it require\nadditivity. It provides a useful starting point for obtaining generalizations of FS that\nreckon, for instance, with nonlinear utility.\nSandbu (2008) comes close to obtaining a preference foundation of FS. He dis-\ntinguish between advantageous and disadvantageous inequity, by imposing a separa-\nbility condition on ‘rank-maintaining’ distributions only. His homotheticity condition\nimplies power utility. FS is the special case of Sandbu where the power of utility\nequals one. Sandbu does not give a preference condition that guarantees a power of\none. Thus, his conditions are not sufﬁcient to characterize exactly FS.\nInstead of adding some extra conditions to Sandbu’s foundation in order to pro-\nvide a preference foundation of exactly FS, this paper aims at minimizing the total\nnumber of preference conditions and at keeping them as simple as possible. Thus, we\nstart anew and focus entirely on FS. This is done to best reﬂect the empirical content\nof FS.\nThe key preference condition for obtaining FS, covalent additivity, suggests a gen-\neralization of FS that is different from Neilson’s and Sandbu’s models. We show that,\nremarkably, FS is a special case of the rank-dependent model of Gilboa (1987) and\n123\nA preference foundation for Fehr and Schmidt’s model 539\nSchmeidler (1986, 1989), a relation that had not been observed in the literature before. 1\nThe rank-dependent model was introduced to explain behavior for Knightean uncer-\ntainty that deviates from expected utility, and it spurred a whole stream of literature on\nambiguity.Tversky and Kahneman (1992) used it to correct a theoretical mistake in the\nmost inﬂuential theory of risk and uncertainty today: prospect theory ( Kahneman and\nTversky 1979 ). For this new version of prospect theory it was possible to establish a\npreference foundation ( Wakker and Tversky 1993 ), proving its theoretical soundness.\nSuch a preference foundation had been missing for the original prospect theory of\n1979. Our main axiom, covalent additivity, is a reﬁnement of Schmeidler’s comono-\ntonic additivity. We show in particular that FS is a special case of a nonmonotonic\nversion of Schmeidler (1986) model. This nonmonotonic version was axiomatized in\ngeneral by De Waegenaere and Wakker (2001). Thus, the latter axiomatization is more\ngeneral than FS and does not capture the particular balance of FS. It is remarkable that\nSchmeidler’s idea provides the basis of a very inﬂuential model not only in decision\nunder uncertainty, but also in interpersonal contexts.\n2 The model\nAssume n + 1 individuals 0 ,..., n. We model preferences ≽ of individual 0 over\ndistributions x = (x\n0,..., xn) yielding payoff xi ∈ R for all i. The notation ≻ ,≼ ,≺,\nand ∼ is as usual. Weak ordering holds if ≽ is complete (x ≽ y or y ≽ x for all\ndistributions x, y) and transitive.\nPreferences ≽ can be represented by a social utility function U when x ≽ y if and\nonly if U(x) ≥ U(y). FS holds if preferences ≽ can be represented by\nU(x) = x0 − α\nn∑\ni=1\nmax{xi − x0,0}− β\nn∑\ni=1\nmax{x0 − xi ,0} (1)\nwith α, β ≥ 0. For every unit by which another individual’s payoff exceeds indi-\nvidual 0’s payoff, individual 0’s utility is decreased by α. For every unit by which\nanother individual’s payoff is lower than individual 0’s payoff, individual 0’s utility\nis decreased by β. Thus, α and β give the prices of being worse off or better off than\nothers. We will next discuss the properties that preferences satisfy when FS holds. We\nﬁrst introduce some more notation.\nFor every distribution x and every individual i = 1,..., n we deﬁne the deviation\nd\ni (x) = xi − x0, i.e. the deviation of the payoff of individual i from the payoff of\nindividual 0. A distribution x is constant if xi = x0 for all i, i.e. if di (x) = 0 for all\ni. For all individuals i = 0,..., n and all distributions x the distribution µi x denotes\nthe distribution x with the payoff of individual i replaced by µ. Every payoff µ ∈ R is\nidentiﬁed with a constant distribution yielding payoff µ for every individual. That is,\ninstead of ( µ,...,µ ) we will often write µ to denote a constant distribution. From the\ncontext it will be clear whether µ denotes a single payoff or a constant distribution.\n1 Similarly, Ben Porath and Gilboa (1994) showed that the Gini-index in inequality measurement is a\nspecial case of rank-dependent utility.\n123\n540 K. I. M. Rohde\nConstant monotonicity holds if µ ≽ ν if and only if µ ≥ ν. Constant monotonicity\nrequires that, in the absence of inequality, higher payoffs are preferred to lower ones.\nIf for a distribution x and a payoff µ we have x ∼ µ, then µ is a constant equivalent\nof x. Under constant monotonicity and transitivity every distribution can have at most\none constant equivalent. Constant equivalence holds if every distribution has a con-\nstant equivalent. However unequal a distribution, under constant equivalence there\nis always a constant distribution that individual 0 ﬁnds equivalent. It can easily be\nveriﬁed that preferences satisfy constant monotonicity and constant equivalence if FS\nholds.\nTwo distributions x, y are covalent if for every individual i = 1,..., n the devia-\ntion has the same sign in both distributions: d\ni (x)di (y) ≥ 0. Thus, if two distributions\nx and y are covalent, then it cannot be the case that an individual i gets strictly more\nthan individual 0 in x and strictly less than individual 0 in y.\nDeﬁnition Covalent additivity holds if for all x, y, z that are pairwise covalent\nx ≽ y ⇐⇒ x + z ≽ y + z.\nConsider two distributions x, y where for every individual i the payoff-ranking of\nindividual i w.r.t individual 0 is the same in both distributions. Consider adding a\ncertain amount to the payoff of individual j in both distributions such that the ranking\nof individual j w.r.t. individual 0 is not changed. Under covalent additivity this addi-\ntion should not affect preference between the two distributions. By repeating such an\naddition for several individuals j, covalent additivity implies that adding a particular\ndistribution to distributions x and y, without affecting the ranking of any individual j\nw.r.t. individual 0, should not affect preferences between the two distributions. Cova-\nlent additivity entails that for every individual the marginal utility from an increase in\nhis payoff is constant as long as the ranking of his payoff w.r.t individual 0’s payoff\nis unaffected. In choice under uncertainty and intertemporal choice marginal utilities\nare commonly diminishing. Neilson (2006) and Sandbu (2008) allow for diminishing\nutility. Covalent additivity and its implied constant marginal utility under preserved\ncovalence is what makes FS a simple and thereby appealing model. FS’s social utility\ncan be calculated directly from payoffs without ﬁrst requiring a speciﬁcation of some\nnonlinear utility function. Yet, its predictions are consistent with the main empirical\nﬁndings in many games and other applications. Covalent additivity is a strong assump-\ntion, though. One could imagine that abandoning the linearity of FS and considering\nnonlinear generalizations, might result in models that can predict behavior even bet-\nter. Yet, abandoning linearity will come at the cost of more complicated models that\nwill be harder to estimate. Future research should show whether the costs of more\ncomplicated estimations are worth the beneﬁts of better predictions.\nTo show that FS implies covalent additivity, we ﬁrst observe that the utility of the\nsum of two covalent distributions equals the sum of the utilities of the two distributions\nif FS holds. This property of the utility function is similar to Schmeidler’s (1986)\ncomonotonic additivity.\nObservation 2.1 If FS holds, then U(x + y) = U(x)\n+ U(y) for all covalent x, y.\n123\nA preference foundation for Fehr and Schmidt’s model 541\nProof We have xi +yi ≥ x0 +y0 if xi ≥ x0 and yi ≥ y0. Similarly, xi +yi ≤ x0 +y0 if\nxi ≤ x0 and yi ≤ y0. Thus, for two covalent distributions x, y we have xi +yi ≥ x0+y0\nif xi > x0, and xi + yi ≤ x0 + y0 if xi < x0. It follows that\nU(x + y) = x0 + y0 − α\nn∑\ni=1\nmax{xi + yi − x0 − y0,0}\n−β\nn∑\ni=1\nmax{x0 + y0 − xi − yi ,0}\n= x0 − α\nn∑\ni=1\nmax{xi − x0,0}− β\nn∑\ni=1\nmax{x0 − xi ,0}\n+ y0 − α\nn∑\ni=1\nmax{yi − y0,0}− β\nn∑\ni=1\nmax{y0 − yi ,0}\n= U(x) + U(y).\n⊓⊔\nThe following observation now follows easily.\nObservation 2.2 If FS holds, then covalent additivity holds.\nAs will be shown later in Observation 2.4, covalent additivity is the most impor-\ntant characteristic of FS. It will be shown that weak ordering, constant monotonicity,\nconstant equivalence, and covalent additivity, together with a weak monotonicity con-\ndition to be deﬁned later, imply that preferences can be represented by\nx\n0 −\nn∑\ni=1\nαi max{xi − x0,0}−\nn∑\ni=1\nβi max{x0 − xi ,0}, (2)\nwith possibly negative coefﬁcients αi and βi . The next few conditions will be needed\nin addition to the previous ones in order to obtain FS.\nDeﬁnition Disadvantage aversion holds if µi 0 ≼ 0 for all payoffs µ ≥ 0 and all\ni = 1,..., n.\nDisadvantage aversion means that individual 0 does not like another individual\nreceiving a positive payoff µ when all other individuals, including himself, receive\nnothing. If FS holds, then preferences satisfy disadvantage aversion, because α ≥ 0:\nfor payoff µ ≥ 0 and for i = 1,..., n we have U(µi 0) =− αµ ≤ 0 = U(0).\nDeﬁnition Advantage aversion holds if µi 0 ≼ 0 for all payoffs µ ≤ 0 and all\ni = 1,..., n.\nAdvantage aversion means that individual 0 does not like another individual receiv-\ning a negative payoff µ when all other individuals, including himself, receive nothing.\nIf FS holds, then preferences satisfy advantage aversion, because β ≥ 0: for payoff\nµ ≤ 0 and for i = 1,..., n we have U(µi 0) = βµ ≤ 0 = U(0).\n123\n542 K. I. M. Rohde\nDeﬁnition Preferences ≽ satisfy inequity aversion if they satisfy disadvantage aver-\nsion and advantage aversion.\nDeﬁnition Preferences ≽ satisfy anonymity if ci 0 ∼ cj 0 for all c and all individuals\ni, j ∈{ 1,..., n}.\nAnonymity means that individual 0 does not favor one individual over the other.\nFS implies anonymity, because the coefﬁcients α and β are independent of the indi-\nviduals, i.e. they are independent of i.\nThe following theorem characterizes FS. As the proof is instructive, we provide it\nin the main text.\nTheorem 2.3 The following two statements are equivalent.\n(i) FS holds (Eq. 1).\n(ii) Preferences ≽ satisfy\n(a) Weak ordering;\n(b) Constant monotonicity;\n(c) Constant equivalence;\n(d) Covalent additivity;\n(e) Inequity aversion;\n(f) Anonymity.\nIn the following observation, we need a (minor) monotonicity condition. Inequity\nmonotonicity holds if for every i = 1,..., n it is impossible to ﬁnd µ,ν ∈ R with (1)\nµν ≥ 0 and (2) µi 0 ≺ 0 and νi 0 ≻ 0. Inequity monotonicity means that if individual\n0 dislikes being worse (better) off than others, then he dislikes this no matter how\nmuch worse (better) off he is.\nObservation 2.4 The following two statements are equivalent.\n(i′) Preferences can be represented by\nx0 −\nn∑\ni=1\nαi max{xi − x0,0}−\nn∑\ni=1\nβi max{x0 − xi ,0}\n(ii′) Preferences ≽ satisfy\n(a) Weak ordering;\n(b) Inequity monotonicity;\n(c) Constant monotonicity;\n(d) Constant equivalence;\n(e) Covalent additivity;\nProof of Theorem 2.3 and Observation 2.4 It was already shown that (i) implies (ii).\nWe will now show that (ii) implies (i). Assume (ii). Before starting the proof, note ﬁrst\nthat inequity aversion implies inequity monotonicity.\nLet e(x) denote the constant equivalent of distribution x. From constant monoto-\nnicity we know that e represents preferences. For all b,c ∈ R\n+ and all i = 1,..., n\n123\nA preference foundation for Fehr and Schmidt’s model 543\nwe have, by covalent additivity and pairwise covalence of bi 0,ci 0, and e(ci 0), the\nindifference bi 0 + ci 0 ∼ bi 0 + e(ci 0). Similarly, bi 0 + e(ci 0) ∼ e(bi 0) + e(ci 0). It\nfollows that\ne((b + c)i 0) ∼ (b + c)i 0\n= bi 0 + ci 0\n∼ bi 0 + e(ci 0)\n∼ e(bi 0) + e(ci 0).\nThus,\ne((b + c)i 0) = e(bi 0) + e(ci 0)\nfor i = 1,..., n.By inequity monotonicity e(bi 0)is either non-negative for all b ∈ R+\nor non-positive for all b ∈ R+. Thus, we can apply Theorem 1 of Section 2.1.1 in\nAczél (1966). It follows that there is an αi ∈ R such that\ne(bi 0) =− αi b\nfor all b ∈ R+ and all i = 1,..., n. By a similar argument we have a βi ∈ R such\nthat\ne(bi 0) = βi b\nfor all b ∈ R− and all i = 1,..., n.\nFor all a ∈ R, all distributions x, all constant distributions c, and all individu-\nals i we have that ai 0,( x0)i x, and c are pairwise covalent. Therefore, by repeated\napplication of covalent additivity we have\ne(x) ∼ x = x0 +\nn∑\ni=1\n(di (x))i 0\n∼ x0 + e((d1(x))10) +\nn∑\ni=2\n(di (x))i 0\n..\n.\n∼ x\n0 +\nn∑\ni=1\ne((di (x))i 0)\n= x0 −\nn∑\ni=1\nαi max{xi − x0,0}−\nn∑\ni=1\nβi max{x0 − xi ,0}.\n123\n544 K. I. M. Rohde\nIt follows that\ne(x) = x0 −\nn∑\ni=1\nαi max{xi − x0,0}−\nn∑\ni=1\nβi max{x0 − xi ,0},\nwhich proves Observation 2.4. Disadvantage aversion implies that αi ≥ 0 for all i.\nSimilarly, advantage aversion implies that βi ≥ 0 for all i. By anonymity we have\nαj = αi ≡ α and βj = βi ≡ β for all i, j, which proves the result. The Appendix\nshows that the preference conditions in Theorem 2.3 are independent. ⊓⊔\nIt is common to restrict α and β such that β< 1/n and α ≥ β. We will now give\nthe behavioral conditions underlying these restrictions.\nDeﬁnition Self-support holds if µ00 ≻ 0 for all payoffs µ> 0.2\nSelf-support means that even if individual 0 is advantage averse, he still prefers\nreceiving a positive payoff to receiving nothing if all other individuals receive noth-\ning. Thus, keeping the payoff of others ﬁxed, individual 0 will always want to maximize\nhis own payoff.\nDeﬁnition Individual 0 prefers advantages over disadvantages if (−µ)i 0 ≽ µi 0f o r\nall µ> 0 and all i = 1,..., n.\nCorollary 2.5 If FS holds, then\n(i) self support holds if and only if β< 1/n.\n(ii) individual 0 prefers advantages over disadvantages if and only if α ≥ β.\n3 Discussion\nThis paper has provided a preference foundation for the inﬂuential utility function\nintroduced by Fehr and Schmidt (1999). This utility function captures self-centered\ninequity aversion in the sense that individuals dislike both being worse off than others,\nand others being worse off than themselves. FS’s model has an exceptionally good\nbalance between parsimony and ﬁt. FS captures preferences in a linear way, which\nmakes it a model which is easy to use. Yet, despite the strong assumption of linearity,\nFS can explain a wide range of ﬁndings in many games and other applications. The\nlinearity of FS’s model is implied by covalent additivity, the most important preference\ncondition in this paper.\nCovalent additivity emphasizes the ranking of other individuals’ payoffs to the\ndecision maker’s payoff; as long as this ranking is unaffected, either increasing or\ndecreasing an individual’s payoff by a common amount in two distributions should\nnot affect preferences between these distributions. The emphasis on rank raises the\nquestion how FS is related to Schmeidler’s (1986, 1989) rank-dependent model.\n2 Note that, given FS, if the condition holds for one µ> 0 it holds for all µ> 0.\n123\nA preference foundation for Fehr and Schmidt’s model 545\nRemarkably, FS is a special case of rank-dependent utility with a non-monotonic\nweighting function.\nRank-dependent utility captures the fact that individuals are concerned about their\nrank in an income distribution ( Rablen 2008). Under rank-dependent utility the weight\nthat an individual attaches to the payoff of another individual depends on the rank of\nthis other individual’s payoff in the distribution of payoffs. It can, for instance, be\nthe case that an individual weights the payoff of another individual when the latter is\npoorest more than when he is richest. Under FS an individual weights the payoffs of\nother individuals who are better off differently from the payoffs of other individuals\nwho are worse off. The payoffs of all others who are worse off or all others who are\nbetter off are weighted equally.\nIt can be veriﬁed that FS is the special case of RDU ( Schmeidler 1986 ;\nDe Waegenaere and Wakker 2001 ) with utility u(x\ni ) = xi and a weighting func-\ntion given by W (I ) = 1 − (n −| I |+ 1)β if 0 ∈ I and W (I ) =− |I |α if 0 /∈ I ,\nwhere |I | gives the number of individuals in the set I .3 Since α, β ≥ 0 the weighting\nfunction is non-monotonic. De Waegenaere and Wakker (2001) provided a preference\nfoundation for RDU with a non-monotonic weighting function and linear utility. Thus,\nan alternative preference foundation of FS could be obtained by taking the conditions\nof De Waegenaere and Wakker (2001) as a point of departure and then adding the\nextra conditions needed to specify FS.\nIt is remarkable that such a famous model as FS turns out to be a special case of\nyet another famous model, without this having been observed in the literature before.\nRank-dependent utility may provide a promising direction for obtaining generaliza-\ntions of FS. Moreover, FS illustrates the importance of generalizing RDU models to\nallow for non-monotonic weighting functions.\nAppendix\nThis Appendix will show that the preference conditions used in the proof of\nTheorem 2.3 are independent. We will show that for each preference condition, drop-\nping it from the list makes it impossible to characterize exactly FS.\nFrom the proof of the theorem it follows that conditions (a)–(e), without anonymity,\nwould not yield exactly FS, as the coefﬁcient α\ni and βi w o u l db ea l l o w e dt od i f f e rf o r\ndifferent individuals i. Similarly, inequity aversion is also required to obtain FS, as\nwithout it the coefﬁcients would be allowed to be negative.\nNeilson’s model\nU(x) = u(x0) +\nn∑\ni=1\nv(xi − x0)\nwould satisfy all axioms (a)–(f) except for covalent additivity.\n3 Sandbu’s model is a special case of RDU with the same weighting function, but nonlinear utility.\n123\n546 K. I. M. Rohde\nThe model\nU(x) =− x0 − α\nn∑\ni=1\nmax{xi − x0,0}− β\nn∑\ni=1\nmax{x0 − xi ,0}\nwould satisfy all axioms (a)–(f) except for constant monotonicity.\nConsider preferences that are as follows. Every constant distribution is preferred to\nevery non-constant distribution. Non-constant distributions are compared using\nU(x) = x0 − α\nn∑\ni=1\nmax{xi − x0,0}− β\nn∑\ni=1\nmax{x0 − xi ,0}\nand constant distributions are compared using\nU(x) = x0 − α\nn∑\ni=1\nmax{xi − x0,0}− β\nn∑\ni=1\nmax{x0 − xi ,0},\nbut a non-constant distribution cannot be compared to a constant distribution using\nthe same functional. By definition every constant distribution is preferred to every\nnon-constant distribution. It can easily be veriﬁed that these preferences satisfy weak\nordering, constant monotonicity, inequity aversion, and anonymity. Clearly, constant\nequivalence is not satisﬁed. Covalent additivity is satisﬁed. The only way in which\ncovalent additivity could be violated is if adding the distribution z to two non-constant\ndistributions x ≽ y would make y + z constant. This would require y and z not to be\ncovalent, which is not allowed by covalent additivity.\nIt remains to be shown that condition (a) is required to obtain FS. Completeness is\nimplied by transitivity, constant equivalence, and constant monotonicity. By constant\nequivalence every distribution has an equivalent constant distribution. Constant mono-\ntonicity implies that all constant distributions can be compared. Transitivity implies\nthat all distributions can be compared through their constant equivalents. Thus, all\ndistributions can be compared and completeness is satisﬁed.\nConsider a setting with two individuals, i.e. n = 1. Let preferences be representable\nby\nU(x) = x\n0 − α\nn∑\ni=1\nmax{xi − x0,0}− β\nn∑\ni=1\nmax{x0 − xi ,0}\nwith β> 1, except when comparing two distributions that are not covalent. When\ntwo distributions are not covalent, they can be compared as follows:\n(x0, x1) ≻ (y0, y1) whenever x0 > x1 and y0 < y1, and\n(x0, x1) ≺ (y0, y1) whenever x0 < x1 and y0 > y1.\n123\nA preference foundation for Fehr and Schmidt’s model 547\nThis preference relation is complete, but not transitive. We can ﬁnd x, y > 0 such\nthat the constant equivalent of (x,0) is smaller than the one of (0, y), which, under\ntransitivity and constant monotonicity would imply that (x,0) ≺ (0, y). Note that,\nexcept for transitivity, all preference conditions are satisﬁed, as these conditions only\nconcern comparisons of covalent distributions.\nOpen Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Noncom-\nmercial License which permits any noncommercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium,\nprovided the original author(s) and source are credited.\nReferences\nAczél J (1966) Lectures on functional equations and their applications.
