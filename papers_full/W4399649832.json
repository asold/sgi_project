  "abstract": "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a mental health condition marked by recurrent intrusive thoughts or sensations that compel individuals to perform repetitive behaviors or mental acts. Obsessions and compulsions significantly disrupt daily life and cause considerable distress. Early identification and intervention improve long-term outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate the ability of four advanced artificial intelligence models (ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, Claude, and Bard) to accurately recognize OCD compared to human professionals and to assess recommended therapies and stigma attributions. This study was conducted during March 2024 utilizing 12 vi-gnettes. Each vignette depicted a client, either a young adult or a middle-aged male or female, attending an initial therapy session. Each vignette was evaluated ten times, resulting in 480 evaluations. The results were compared with those of a human sample of 514 psychotherapists, as reported by Canavan. Significant differences were found. AI models demonstrated higher OCD recognition rates and confidence levels than human professionals and showed 100% confidence in recognition, compared to 87% among psychotherapists. AI models also recommended evi-dence-based interventions more frequently, with ChatGPT-3.5 and Claude at 100%, ChatGPT-4 at 90%, and Bard at 60%, compared to 61.9% among psychotherapists. Additionally, AI models ex-hibited significantly lower stigma and danger estimations, though both AI and psychotherapists demonstrated high willingness to treat the described cases. The findings suggest that AI models surpass human professionals in recognizing OCD and recommending evidence-based treatments while also demonstrating lower stigma. These results highlight the potential of AI tools to enhance OCD diagnosis and treatment in clinical settings.",
