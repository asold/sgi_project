As such, they\nare of great importance for indexing, categorizing,\nand mining in many information retrieval and natu-\nral language processing tasks (Jones and Staveley,\n1999; Frank et al., 1999; Hulth and Megyesi, 2006;\nDave et al., 2003). Keyphrase generation is the\ntask of automatically predicting keyphrases given\n∗ Qingyu Yin and Zheng Li are corresponding authors.\nThis work was mainly done while Rui Meng was a Ph.D.\nstudent at University of Pittsburgh.\n1The datasets are released at https://github.\ncom/Yifan-Gao/multilingual_keyphrase_\ngeneration.\na piece of long text. Existing works on keyphrase\ngeneration mostly focus on English datasets (Gal-\nlina et al., 2019; Meng et al., 2017) while keyphrase\ngeneration for languages other than English is\nstill under-explored. Since search engines usu-\nally provide services to customers using different\nlanguages, multilingual keyphrase generation be-\ncomes a significant problem while it is still un-\nknown how well existing keyphrase generation ap-\nproaches perform in non-English languages.\nNevertheless, there are two challenges we will\nface regarding multilingual keyphrase generation.\nFirst, to the best of our knowledge, there is no large-\nscale dataset publicly available for training and\nbenchmarking multilingual keyphrase generation\nmodels. Building keyphrase datasets at a sufficient\nscale is difficult and costly. Second, compared with\nthe existing datasets in English, which can contain\nmillions of data examples and cover a wide diver-\nsity of topics, the data resources in non-English\nlanguages are inherently scarce. For example, in\nthe domain of e-commerce, marketplaces using En-\nglish have abundant customer queries to be used for\nkeyphrase mining, while queries in some languages\nare relatively less than in English, which is proba-\nbly because of a smaller size of user population or\na shorter operation time.\nWe start tackling these challenges by contribut-\ning two new datasets for multilingual keyphrase,\nwhich cover six languages and two domains. The\nfirst dataset EcommerceMKP is collected from a\nreal-world major e-commerce website. The prod-\nuct descriptions are used as the source text while\nthe target keyphrases are collected from user search\nqueries. This dataset contains a total of 73k data ex-\namples, covering four different languages (Spanish,\nGerman, Italian and French). The second multi-\nlingual keyphrase dataset AcademicMKP lies in\nthe academic domain, in which titles and abstracts\nare used as the source text and the author-provided\nkeyphrases are deemed targets. A total of 2,693 aca-\n1233\ndemic papers in Chinese and Korean are included\nin AcademicMKP.\nTo overcome the resource scarcity challenge\nin training multilingual models, we propose a\nretrieval-based method to leverage the keyphrase\nknowledge in large-scale English datasets. By in-\nvestigating multilingual keyphrase data, we ob-\nserve that data in different languages may talk\nabout similar topics. Therefore, we conjecture\nthat passage-keyphrases pairs in English can be\nof help as an external knowledge base for multilin-\ngual keyphrase generation. To be specific, given a\npassage in low-resource language XX, we propose\nto use a retrieval model to find multiple top-related\npassages in English. These retrieved English pas-\nsages provide high-quality English keyphrases that\ncan be used as hints for generating keyphrases in\nother languages. After that, the generator takes the\ncode-mixed inputs, including the passage in lan-\nguage XX and retrieved English keyphrases, and\npredicts keyphrases in language XX.\nIn the cross-lingual retrieval training, parallel\npassage-keyphrases pairs between English and\nother languages are extremely limited. For ex-\nample, in the e-commerce domain, only a small\nfraction of products have both English and non-\nEnglish descriptions (being sold in multiple coun-\ntries). Such a data scarcity issue weakens the abil-\nity of cross-lingual knowledge acquisition from\nhigh-resource English keyphrases as intermediary,\nand finally hinders the potential of the retrieval-\naugmented keyphrase generation. To mitigate the\nproblem, we propose a retriever-generator iterative\ntraining (RGIT) algorithm to automatically mine\npseudo training parallel pairs from unlabeled data.\nConcretely, the retriever can dynamically adjust in\nterms of the current variations of generation perfor-\nmance between the proposed retrieval-augmented\ngenerator and the base one without the aid of re-\ntrieved English keyphrases. Starting from insuf-\nficient seed parallel pairs, if the retrieved pseudo\npassage-keyphrases pairs in the current iteration\ncan bring in higher generation results as the gener-\nator’s feedback, those pseudo parallel data will be\nregarded as high quality and incorporated into the\nseed ones to further boost the retriever. Such cycle\nproviding positive effects can be repeated until the\nincreasing generation performance stopped.\nWe conduct extensive experiments on Ecom-\nmerceMKP and AcademicMKP and demonstrate\nthat large-scale English datasets do provide use-\nful knowledge for multilingual keyphrase genera-\ntion. The proposed retrieval-augmented method\noutperforms traditional extraction-based models,\nsequence-to-sequence neural models, and its vari-\nants. Moreover, the RGIT algorithm boosts the\nretrieval performance significantly by mining over\n20k pseudo-parallel passage pairs. We also conduct\ndetailed analyses to investigate the effectiveness of\nretriever-generator iterative training.\n2 Related Work\nKeyphrase Generation. The advance of neural\nlanguage generation enables models to freely gen-\nerate keyphrases according to the phrase impor-\ntance and semantics, rather than extracting a list of\nsub-strings from the text (Witten et al., 1999a; Liu\net al., 2011; Wang et al., 2016). Meng et al. (2017)\npropose the first keyphrase generation model Copy-\nRNN, which not only generates words based on a\nvocabulary but also points to words in the source\ntext — overcoming the barrier of predicting absent\nkeyphrases. Following this idea, Chen et al. (2018);\nZhao and Zhang (2019); Ahmad et al. (2021) lever-\nage the attention mechanism to reduce duplication\nand improve coverage. Chen et al. (2019b); Ye\nand Wang (2018); Wang et al. (2019); Liang et al.\n(2021) propose to leverage extra structure informa-\ntion (e.g., title, topic) to guide the generation. Chan\net al. (2019); Luo et al. (2021) propose a model\nusing reinforcement learning, and Swaminathan\net al. (2020) propose using GAN for KPG. Chen\net al. (2020) introduce hierarchical decoding and\nexclusion mechanism to prevent models from gen-\nerating duplicate phrases. Ye et al. (2021b) propose\nto dynamically align target phrases to eliminate the\ninfluence of order, as highlighted by Meng et al.\n(2021). Mu et al. (2020); Liu et al. (2020a); Park\nand Caragea (2020) use pre-trained language mod-\nels for better representations of documents.\nRetrieval Augmented Text Generation (RAG)\nrecently shows great power in knowledge-intensive\nNLP tasks such as open-domain question answer-\ning, fact checking and entity linking (Lewis et al.,\n2020; Petroni et al., 2021; Guu et al., 2020). In\nRAG, a retriever (either sparse (Lee et al., 2019) or\ndense (Karpukhin et al., 2020)) searches for use-\nful non-parametric knowledge from a knowledge\nbase, then a generator combines the non-parametric\nretrieved knowledge with its parametric knowl-\nedge, learned during pre-training, for solving the\ntask.

Similar approaches have been in-\nvestigated in neural machine translation (Gu et al.,\n2018; Cai et al., 2021), dialogue (Weston et al.,\n2018), and knowledge-base QA (Das et al., 2021).\nIn keyphrase generation, Chen et al. (2019a); Ye\net al. (2021a); Kim et al. (2021) retrieve similar\ndocuments from training data to produce more ac-\ncurate keyphrases. However, their retrieval module\nis a non-parametric model and cannot be gener-\nalized in the multilingual setting due to the large\nvocabulary gap between languages.\n3 Task Definition\nIn this paper, we aim to tackle the keyphrase genera-\ntion task in a multilingual setting, which means one\nmodel of desire is capable of generating keyphrases\nin any language that it has been trained with. The\nbenefits of having a single keyphrase generation\nmodel for multiple languages are threefold: (1)\nCollecting keyphrase annotation for individual lan-\nguage can be prohibitively expensive; (2) Training\nand deploying separate models for each language is\nlaborious; (3) Joint training of multiple languages\ncan alleviate the resource scarcity by utilizing rich\nmonolingual data.\nFormally, we define the multilingual keyphrase\ngeneration task as follows. Given a piece of text\npXX in language XX, our goal is to predict its\ncorresponding keyphrases kXX\n1 ,kXX\n2 ,...,k XX\nn in lan-\nguage XX, where n is the total number of target\nkeyphrases for this text pXX. In this study, XX\ncan be German ( DE), Spanish (ES), Italian (IT),\nFrench (FR), Korean (KO) or Chinese (ZH).\n4 Model\nScarcity of resources is one of the topmost chal-\nlenges for multilingual tasks, which is also the case\nfor multilingual keyphrase generation. One may\nfind it difficult to collect enough text data in lan-\nguages other than English, much less the annotation\nof keyphrases in specific domains. To overcome\nthis problem, we propose a retrieval-augmented\napproach to make use of the relatively rich re-\nsources in English. The motivation for our pro-\nposed retrieval-augmented approach comes from\nan observation from data: texts and keyphrases\nexpressed in different languages usually share com-\nmon topics or knowledge concepts. For exam-\nple, in e-commerce websites, it is often the case\nthat the same products are sold in different mar-\nketplaces/countries. Thus these products as well\nas their keyphrases, though exhibited in different\nlanguages, can share a high semantic similarity.\nIn other words, given a text in language pAA, if\nwe could find a similar text in language pBB, its\nassociated keyphrases kBB may serve as a good\nhint for the to-be-generated keyphrases kAA in lan-\nguage AA. Since English has the most abundant\ntext-keyphrases pairs in both e-commerce and aca-\ndemic papers domains, its resource can be treated\nas a non-parametric keyphrase knowledge base,\nwhich provides texts in English covering a wide\nrange of topics and concepts, as well as the associ-\nated high-quality keyphrases.\nAs shown in Fig. 1, our framework consists of a\nretrieval step and a generation step:\n1.

These retrieved\nEnglish keyphrases are taken as external knowl-\nedge for keyphrase generation in step 2.\n2. Generation Step: taking the source text pXX\nin language XX and all retrieved English\nkeyphrases { kEN\n1,1, ..., kEN\n1,n1 }, ..., { kEN\nm,1, ...,\nkEN\nm,nm} as inputs, the generation module con-\ncatenates them as a sequence and generates\nkeyphrases in target language XX.\n4.1 Cross-Lingual Dense Passage Retrieval\nThe cross-lingual retriever includes a passage en-\ncoder EP(·) and a query encoder EQ(·). The pas-\nsage encoder EP(·) maps millions of English pas-\nsages into d-dimensional vectors and builds indices\nfor all English passages using FAISS (Johnson\net al., 2021) offline. At inference time, the pas-\nsage in language XX goes through the query en-\ncoder EQ(·) and is converted into a d-dimensional\nvector. Then the cross-lingual retriever performs a\nKNN search to retrieve mEnglish passages whose\nvectors are closest to the query vector measured\nby the dot product similarity: sim(pXX,pENj ) =\nEQ(pXX)⊤EP(pEN\nj ).\nPassage Encoder. Since naive lexical similar-\nity can hardly handle text matching across lan-\nguages, we resort to a BERT-based dense pas-\nsage retriever (Karpukhin et al., 2020), expecting\nthe contextualized semantic matching can retrieve\nsimilar passages accurately and robustly. In or-\nder to meet the demand of multilingual represen-\ntation, we utilize multilingual pre-trained model\nmBERT (Devlin et al., 2019) to encode passages\ninto 768-dimensional vectors.\nTraining. Since the output vectors of mBERT are\nnot aligned across languages, we need extra align-\nment training to ensure that similar passages in dif-\nferent languages can be mapped into near regions\nin the high-dimensional space. Given a passage\npXX\ni in language XX, we take its corresponding En-\nglish passage pEN+\ni as the positive example and ran-\ndomly select nnegative passages pEN−\ni,1 ,...,p EN−\ni,n in\nthe English corpus. The dense retriever is trained\nby optimizing the negative log likelihood loss of\nthe positive English passage.\nIn the e-commerce domain, we select the\npositive passage according to product metadata.\nFor a product sold in both EN and XX market-\nplaces, we regard its bilingual product descrip-\ntions (pXX\ni ,pEN+\ni ) as a parallel passage pair, i.e.,\npositive training example. For the domain of aca-\ndemic paper, we notice that papers with parallel\ntext is very rare. Therefore, we develop an auto-\nmatic approach to mine parallel abstract pairs of\nEnglish and the target language. Specifically, we\nadopt an off-the-shelf bi-text mining tool named\nSentence Transformers (Reimers and Gurevych,\n2019) to mine pseudo parallel pairs. Given two\ndatasets in different languages, we encode passages\nusing LaBSE (Feng et al., 2020), the current best\nmethod for learning language-agnostic sentence\nembeddings for 109 languages, and then parallel\npassages can be extracted through nearest-neighbor\nretrieval and filtered by setting a fixed threshold\nover a margin-based similarity score, as proposed\nin (Artetxe and Schwenk, 2019).\n4.2 Multilingual Keyphrase Generation with\nCode-Mixed Inputs\nGiven the top m retrieved English passages pEN\n1 ,\n..., pEN\nm, we find their associated keyphrases in the\n1236\ndataset: {kEN\n1,1, ..., kEN\n1,n1 }, ..., {kEN\nm,1, ..., kEN\nm,nm}.\nWe utilize mBART (Liu et al., 2020b), a multilin-\ngual denoising pre-trained sequence-to-sequence\nlanguage model, to integrate information from mul-\ntiple languages. Different from machine transla-\ntion which maps a sentence a the source language\nto a target language, our multilingual keyphrase\ngeneration model takes code-mixed inputs – a com-\nbination of retrieved English keyphrases {kEN\n1,1, ...,\nkEN\n1,n1 }, ..., {kEN\nm,1, ..., kEN\nm,nm}from mretrieved En-\nglish passages and the source passage pXX in the\ntarget language XX.\nWe concatenate retrieved English keyphrases\nwith a delimiter token [SEP], and add special to-\nkens to separate different inputs: [ENKPS] for\nretrieved keyphrases and [CTX] for the source\npassage. Besides, we follow the fine-tuning setup\nof mBART by adding the language identifier[XX]\n(e.g. [DE] for German) at the end of the input\nsequence to denote the current input language:\n[ENKPS] kEN\n1,1 [SEP] ... [SEP] kEN\nm,nm [CTX] pXX [XX].\nThe training target is a sequence of concatenated\nkeyphrases kXX\n1 , ..., kXX\nn , separated by a special to-\nken [SEP]. [XX], the language identifier of the\ncurrent language, is also added at the beginning of\nthe target sequence to indicate the target language:\n[XX] kXX\n1 [SEP] kXX\n2 [SEP] ... [SEP] kXX\nn .\n4.3 Retriever-Generator Iterative Training\nIn spite of having utilized parallel passage pairs\nto align the multilingual representations of the re-\ntrieval module, it remains a concern because the\nparallel passage pairs between English and non-\nEnglish languages account for only a small por-\ntion of the whole multilingual dataset. For ex-\nample, in a popular e-commerce platform, only a\nsmall percentage of products (less than 10%) have\nboth English and non-English descriptions. With-\nout enough quality parallel pairs, the cross-lingual\ndense passage retriever may not work well to find\nrelevant English passages. Consequently, associ-\nated English keyphrases may provide little help for\nmultilingual keyphrase generation.\nTo make the multilingual keyphrase generation\ngeneralize better to any target languages or do-\nmains without reliance on numerous parallel pas-\nsage pairs, we propose an iterative training method\nto mine parallel passages which requires only a\nsmall number of initial parallel pairs of bootstrap\nthe process.

That said, we\nexpect the mined pseudo parallel passage pairs to\nbe of high quality according to the retrieval score,\nat the same time they can be directly helpful for\ntraining the generation module.\nThe proposed iterative training approach is\nsketched in Algo. 1 and Fig. 2. Given aLarge-Scale\nkeyphrase dataset in English DLS = {(pEN\nLS,kEN\nLS)}\nand a smaller one DXX = {(pXX,kXX)}in tar-\nget language XX, we denote the set of anno-\ntated parallel examples (bilingual passages in\nEnglish and other languages) as PARallel split\nDPAR = {(pEN\nPAR,pXX\nPAR,kEN\nPAR,kXX\nPAR)}, in which\n{(pXX\nPAR,kXX\nPAR)}comes from the XX dataset while\n{(pEN\nPAR,kEN\nPAR)}comes from the English dataset.\nThe remaining data examples in the target dataset\n1237\nLanguageTrainSize DevSize TestSizePassage Length(Avg/Std/Mid)#Keyphrases(Avg/Std/Mid)AbsentKps%\nAcademicMKP Dataset\nChinese (ZH)1,110 158 319 217/48/207 5/1/5 27.2%Korean (KO)774 110 222 115/31/111 4/1/4 37.7%Total 1,884 268 541 171/57/155 4/1/4 31.3%\nEcommerceMKP Dataset\nGerman (DE)23,997 1,411 2,825 157/79/141 10/5/8 57.1%Spanish (ES)12,222 718 1,440 159/84/139 9/5/7 54.6%French (FR)16,986 998 2,000 163/84/144 9/5/8 63.0%Italian (IT)9,163 538 1,081 167/84/152 8/3/7 42.6%Total 62,368 3,665 7,346 161/82/143 9/5/7 56.4%\nTable 1: AcademicMKP & EcommerceMKP Dataset\nDXX have no annotated corresponding English ex-\namples in DLS (the pairs may exist but are not\nknown yet), and we name this set as the Non-\nParallel split DNP = {(pXX\nNP,kXX\nNP)}. We firstly\nfine-tune a mBART using only keyphrases data\nof target language {(pXX\nPAR,kXX\nPAR)}in DPAR (Line\n4). Then we start a loop to mine pseudo paral-\nlel passage pairs for refining the passage retriever.\nEach iteration is expected to bring in a higher qual-\nity of pseudo passage pairs, resulting in a better\nperformance of retriever, with three steps:\n1. We train a retriever Rt using existing available\nEN-XX passage pairs {(pEN\nPAR,pXX\nPAR)}from both\nparallel passage data DPAR and most up-to-date\npseudo passage data Dt\nPSEUDO (Line 8).\n2. We train a retrieval-augmented model Gt us-\ning multilingual passages {(pXX\nPAR,kXX\nPAR)}from\nthe parallel data DPAR and retrieved English\nkeyphrases {ˆkEN\nLS}from the English dataset\nDLS (Line 14). To get the retrieved English\nkeyphrases for each passage pXX\nPAR, we take the\nretriever Rt trained in step (1) to do a KNN\nsearch for passages ˆpEN\nLS in EN DLS and find\ntheir associated keyphrases {ˆkEN\nLS}(Line 10-12).\n3. For each passage pXX\nNP in the non-aligned dataset\nDNP, we also retrieve English passages ˆpEN\nLS\nand keyphrases {ˆkEN\nLS}from DLS (Line 18-19).\nThen the retrieved English passage ˆpEN\nLS will\nbe taken as the parallel text to pXX\nNP if its as-\nsociated keyphrases {ˆkEN\nLS}provide useful in-\nformation. The usefulness is measured by the\nkeyphrase generation performance (F-score)\nbetween the retrieval-augmented generation\nmodel Gt and the base model G0 that does\nnot use EN keyphrases (Line 21-25).\nAfter T iterations, we train the retriever on the\npseudo data DT\nPSEUDO and fine-tune it on the parallel\ndata DPAR. Then we treat it as our final retriever\nand train the generation model in Sec. 4.2.\n5 Datasets\nEcommerceMKP Dataset is collected from a\npopular E-commerce shopping platform. There\nare four languages we consider for building Ecom-\nmerceMKP: German (DE), French (FR), Spanish\n(ES) and Italian (IT). The title, product descrip-\ntion, and bullet description provided by manufac-\nturers are concatenated and treated as source in-\nput. The keyphrases of each product are selected\nfrom search queries under the following protocol.\nFirst, given a product, we only keep search queries\nthat lead to purchases and treat them as effective\nqueries. Then phrases are chunked from these effec-\ntive queries using AutoPhrase (Shang et al., 2018)\nand further ranked by their frequency. Our assump-\ntion is: the more times a phrase appears in effective\nsearch queries of a product, the more important\na phrase is. Finally a threshold is set to filter out\nunimportant phrases. Under this protocol, we re-\nceive 73k examples over four languages. The statis-\ntics are shown in Table 1.\nWe collect the passages and keyphrases under\nthe same protocol for the English (EN) dataset and\nname it as EcommerceMKP-EN. In total the En-\nglish dataset contains 3 million passage-keyphrases\npairs. To obtain the parallel passage pairs for train-\ning the cross-lingual dense passage retriever, we\npair the product descriptions in different languages\naccording to the product identification information.\nWe select a total of 1,247 parallel passages from\nEcommerceMKP training set which include 480\npassages for DE-EN, 244 for ES-EN, 340 for FR-\nEN, and 183 for IT-EN. Besides, we keep 1,000\nparallel passage pairs in the DEV set of Ecom-\nmerceMKP to evaluate the performance of retrieval\nand bi-text mining.\nAcademicMKP Dataset is collected from the\nacademic domain. We take the title and abstract of\neach paper as the source text and author-provided\nkeywords as the target output. All papers are\nsampled from Microsoft Academic Graph (Sinha\net al., 2015), a web-scale academic entity graph\nthat contains multiple types of scholarly entities\nand relationships: field of study, author, institu-\ntion, abstract, venue, and keywords. We use Spacy\n(https://spacy.io/) to detect the language\nof abstracts and keyphrases, and choose two lan-\nguages Chinese (ZH) and Korean (KO) to construct\nthe AcademicMKP dataset.

For example, keyphrases might be miss-\ning or contain incorrect information such as titles,\nauthor names, and publication venues. Some of\nthe abstracts are incomplete. Therefore, we hire\nthree annotators to manually examine the samples\nfrom MAG dataset. Data examples with incomplete\nabstracts are removed. We further manually ver-\nify the metadata of all examples and correct their\nkeyphrase information if needed. Finally, 2,693\nhigh-quality data examples of scientific papers in\nthe computer science domain are collected to con-\nstitute AcademicMKP.\nBesides the multilingual AcademicMKP dataset,\nwe use KP20K (Meng et al., 2017) as the English\ndata for retrieval-augmented generation. KP20K\nhas 560k abstract-keyphrases pairs collected from\nvarious online digital libraries in computer science\ndomain. The threshold is set as 1.03 for passage\nmining and we receive 841 parallel passage pairs\nfrom AcademicMKP training set, in which 433\nZH-EN passage pairs and 384 for KO-EN.\n6 Experimental Setup\n6.1 Evaluation Metrics\nKeyphrase Generation. Let the ground truth\nkeyphrases be Y : k1,k2,...,k n and the pre-\ndicted keyphrases be ˜Y : ˜k1,˜k2,..., ˜kM, we com-\npute the precision (P@M), recall (R@M) and F-\nscore ( F1@M) between Y and ˜Y as P@M =\n|Y∩˜Y|\n|˜Y| ,R@M = |Y∩˜Y|\n|Y| ,F1@M = 2×P×R\nP+R , where\n|Y|denotes the number of keyphrases in the gold\nset Y. We only consider exact match of two\nkeyphrases (with some post-processing such as low-\nercase) for |Y∩˜Y|. Then the average are computed\nfor all languages in the test set.\nPassage Retrieval. The quantity of retrieved En-\nglish passages directly influences how much ex-\nternal knowledge could be utilized for keyphrase\ngeneration. Therefore, we evaluate the top-k re-\ncall (k=1,2,5,10,20) on the DEV set for evaluating\nretrieval performance.\n6.2 Baselines and Ablations\nWe consider following baselines and ablations:\n1) Unsupervised Statistical Keyphrase Extrac-\ntion: KP-Miner (El-Beltagy and Rafea, 2010),\nYAKE (Campos et al., 2020); 2) Unsuper-\nvised Graph-based Keyphrase Extraction: Tex-\ntRank (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004), TopicalPageR-\nank (Sterckx et al., 2015), PositionRank (Florescu\nand Caragea, 2017), MultipartiteRank (Boudin,\n2018); 3) Supervised Feature-based Keyphrase\nExtraction: KEA (Witten et al., 1999b); 4) Neural\n1239\nSupervised Keyphrase Generation: CopyRNN,\nTransformer; 5) mBART (monolingual) : sepa-\nrately trained 6 mBART models on each language;\n6) mBART (multilingual) : a single mBART\nmodel on all languages; 7) mBART + EN Joint\nTrain: a mBART model jointly trained on the\nmultilingual data and English data (KP20K (Meng\net al., 2017) for AcademicMKP; EcommerceMKP-\nEN for EcommerceMKP). 8) mBART + EN Pre-\ntrain: a mBART firstly pre-trained on the English\ndata and then fine-tuned on the multilingual data.9)\nRAMKG (Ours): The Retrieval-Augmented Mul-\ntilingual Keyphrase Generation model (Sec. 4.1 &\n4.2). 10) RAMKG + RGIT (Ours) : RAMKG\nimproved with retriever-generator iterative training\n(RGIT) (Sec. 4.3).\n7 Results and Analyses\n7.1 Main Results\nMain results are shown in Table 2 & 3 for Ecom-\nmerceMKP and AcademicMKP respectively, and\nwe make the following observations:\n• The unsupervised approaches, both statistical-\nbased and graph-based, have robust results\nacross all languages. PositionRank performs\nthe best among all unsupervised approaches.\n• The supervised approaches consistently outper-\nform unsupervised approaches. The feature-\nbased approach KEA receives a high recall by\npredicting more keyphrases while the Copy-\nRNN receives a high precision. Different from\nthe results on English keyphrase generation\nwhere Transformer and CopyRNN are compa-\nrable, the Transformer beats the CopyRNN by\na large margin in the multilingual scenario.\n• We observe that jointly training on all lan-\nguages (mBART multilingual) receives better\nresults than separately training on each lan-\nguage (mBART monolingual). This implies\nthe ability of locating and summarizing key in-\nformation is transferable across languages.\n• Comparing different approaches using external\nlarge-scale English data, we find that our pro-\nposed RAMKG outperforms both “EN Joint\nTrain” and “EN Pretrain”. This is because the\nretrieval-augmented approach provides auxil-\niary knowledge information as part of the input\nto the generation module, while the other two\nvariants have to “infuse” the knowledge learned\nfrom English data to model parameters. More-\nover, “EN Joint Train” and “EN Pretrain” have\nRecall @ Top K 1 2 5 10 20\nRAMKG 26.4% 36.8% 50.1% 59.2% 67.3%RAMKG + RGIT 45.8% 58.3% 72.4% 79.5% 85.2%\nTable 4: Retrieval recall on EcommerceMKP DEV set.\nIteration 1 2 3 4 5 6\n# Pseudo Passages 20,288 21,402 19,942 21,241 22,343 21,557Label Accuracy % 28.0% 37.9% 40.5% 44.2% 45.1% 47.0%\nTable 5: Number of pseudo parallel passages and their\naccuracy on EcommerceMKP DEV set in different iter-\nations of parallel passages mining.\nno positive effect on AcademicMKP dataset (Ta-\nble 3). Compared with multilingual and English\ndata are from the same website, there is still a\ndomain gap between papers (multilingual) in\nAcademicMKP and papers (English) in KP20K.\n• The retriever-generator self-training (RAMKG\n+ Iter) alleviates the data scarcity issue with the\nhelp of stronger retriever: since the retriever\ncan find more relevant English keyphrases, it\nleads to a general improvement on keyphrase\nperformance across languages.\n7.2 Effect of Iterative Training\nRetrieval Results We investigate the effect of\nretriever-generator iterative training by comparing\nthe retrieval recall for models trained w/o and w/\nthe mined pseudo parallel passage pairs. Results\non the DEV set of EcommerceMKP are shown in\nthe Table 4. With additional mined pseudo parallel\npassage pairs, the retriever improves the Recall@5\nfrom 50.1% to 72.4%. And therefore, the better\nretrieved English keyphrases lead to a better gener-\nation performance (44.50 vs. 45.73 in Table 2).\nQuantity and Quality of Pseudo Parallel Pas-\nsages We show the quantity and quality of mined\npseudo parallel pairs in Table 5. After each itera-\ntion of passage mining, our algorithm can consis-\ntently find around 20k passage pairs from Ecom-\nmerceMKP training set, which are nearly 20 times\nof the initial data. To assess the quality of mined\npassage pairs, we examine the label accuracy using\nthe 1,000 parallel passage pairs from the DEV set\nof EcommerceMKP. Results in Table 5 show that\nwhile the passage mining finds a similar number of\npseudo passage pairs, the labelling accuracy does\nincrease from 28.0% to 47.0%. This is because the\nbetter pseudo parallel data improves the retriever,\nand the stronger retriever results in a better genera-\ntor, which in turn leads to more relevant passages.\n1240\n50.0%55.0%60.0%65.0%70.0%75.0%80.0%\n1.2k1.8k3k6k\nRetrieval Recall @ 5\nR1RN44.444.644.845.045.245.445.645.8\n1.2k1.8k3k6k\nGenerationF1\nG1GN𝐑!𝐑\" 𝐆!𝐆\"\n#Initial Parallel Passage Pairs#Initial Parallel Passage Pairs\nFigure 3: Performance of passage retrieval and\nkeyphrase generation on EcommerceMKP, with differ-\nent number of initial parallel data for iterative training.\nProduct Description (German): Steiff 113437 Soft Cud-\ndly Friends Honey Teddybär, grau, 38 cm.

Correct predictions are in green while wrong\npredictions are in red.\nInitializing with Different Amount of Parallel\nData To investigate the impact of initial parallel\npassage on the training, we conduct experiments\nby varying the number of parallel passage pairs on\nEcommerceMKP, from 1.2k (default setting) to 6k\ninstances. We compare the single-round training\n(i.e., training with initial data) and iterative train-\ning after six rounds (in which round we generally\nobtain the best retrieval recall), on both passage\nretrieval (R1 & R6) and keyphrase generation (G1\n& G6). Results are shown in Fig. 3. We observe\nthat (1) the score of iterative training consistently\nincrease when more annotated parallel data is avail-\nable; (2) our iterative training demonstrates great\nrobustness with limited parallel data (e.g. 1.2k\npairs), while the benefit gradually diminishes while\nmore parallel data becomes available.\n7.3 Case Study\nFig. 4 exhibits an example of our model’s predic-\ntion. Given a product description in German, the\nmodel retrieves several English keyphrases and\ngenerates keyphrases in German accurately (trans-\nlations in English are also provided). Through\nthis example, we find that the retrieved English\nkeyphrases do provide certain useful information\nsuch as “steiff teddy bear”, “grey” and “soft”, while\nit also brings some noise such as “my first”, “sweet-\nheart” and “vintage”. Although there is a wrong\nprediction “jimmy” caused by the retrieved En-\nglish keyphrases, the improvement in results shows\nthat the benefits of retrieved knowledge outweigh\nthe noise it introduces. Moreover,the retrieved\nkeyphrases are only regarded as a supplement to\nthe original passage, and the generator can au-\ntomatically focus on the informative parts from\nboth inputs through self-attention. Our retrieval-\naugmented multilingual keyphrase generation can\ntolerate some noise from the retrieved English\nkeyphrases and predict better keyphrases based on\nthese external knowledge.\n8 Conclusion\nIn this study, we investigate a novel task setting\n– multilingual keyphrase generation – and con-\ntribute two new multilingual keyphrase generation\ndatasets covering multiple domains and languages.\nFurthermore, we propose a retrieval-augmented\nmultilingual keyphrase generation framework with\nretriever-generator iterative training. Results show\nthat the proposed approach outperforms a wide\nrange of baselines.\nReferences\nWasi Ahmad, Xiao Bai, Soomin Lee, and Kai-Wei\nChang. 2021.

In\nProceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Asso-\nciation for Computational Linguistics, pages 5224–\n5233.\n1244\nA Appendix\nA.1 Implementation Details\nIn the cross-lingual dense passage retriever, we use\n“bert-base-multilingual-cased” model (Wolf et al.,\n2020) to initialize the query and passage encoders\nand fine-tune it for 15 epochs with a batch size of\n32. We share the parameters between the query\nencoder EQ(·) and the passage encoder EP(·) and\nmap English and non-English passages into the\nsame embedding space. Empirical results show\nthe encoder with parameter sharing can perform\nslightly better. The positive examples are the corre-\nsponding English passages while we randomly sam-\nple 100 passages as negative examples in training.\nFor the retrieval-augmented keyphrase generator,\nwe fine-tune “mbart-large-cc25” (Wolf et al., 2020)\nfor 10 epochs with Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2015)\noptimizer with a learning rate of 1e-4, a batch size\nof 8, a warm-up rate of 50 training steps. Similar to\nmost Seq2Seq models, we train the mBART-based\ngeneration module by optimizing the negative log-\nlikelihood loss of the ground-truth keyphrase se-\nquence, and use beam search decoding with a beam\nsize of 5 during inference. The number of retrieved\nkeyphrases mfor retrieval-augmented generation\nis a hyperparameter and is tuned on the develop-\nment set. We use keyphrases from m= 1English\npassages for AcademicMKP dataset and m = 5\nfor EcommerceMKP dataset. During inference, we\nset the maximum target sequence length as 128\nand set the beam decoding size as 5. For parallel\npassage mining via iterative training, we continue\nthe iterative process until the retrieval recall does\nnot improve. The total number of iterations (T in\nAlgo. 1) are 6 and 3 on EcommerceMKP and Aca-\ndemicMKP respectively. The threshold τ in Line\n23 for Algo. 1 is set as 5.\nA.2 Variants of Retrieval Targets\nThere exists a misalignment between the retriever\nand the generator model. The retriever retrieves\nsimilar passages while the generator utilizes the\nassociated keyphrases of these passages (not the\nretrieved passages) as external knowledge for gen-\neration. Therefore, a good retriever does not neces-\nsarily guarantee the good quality and usefulness of\nthese keyphrases.\nWe tried two different retrieval targets which\nmight close the misalignment. Given a non-English\npassage, we tried to either directly retrieve En-\nglish keyphrases (RAMKG-P2K) or retrieve the\nModel Retrieval Results Generation Results\nRecall@1 Recall@2 Recall@5 P R F1\nP2P 26.00% 36.78% 50.05% 48.51 44.71 44.50\nP2K 2.86% 4.70% 9.09% 46.91 43.13 42.95\nP2PK 25.25% 35.45% 49.51% 48.50 44.39 44.34\nTable 6: Results of RAMKG variants with different\nretrieval targets.\nτ 0 5 10 15\nRecall 62.28% 64.01% 63.67% 62.97%\nTable 7: Influence of the threshold τ on the retriever-\ngenerator self-training algorithm.\nconcatenated sequences of passage-keyphrase pair\n(RAMKG-P2PK). We find that (1) RAMKG-P2K\nthat directly retrieves keyphrases has poor re-\ntrieval performance. This is because it is hard to\ncapture the similarity between non-English pas-\nsages and English keyphrases; (2) RAMKG-P2PK\nhas slightly worse results than only retrieval EN\npassages, which implies that additionally adding\nkeyphrases in the retrieval targets does not bring\nany benefit.\nResults are shown in Table 6. RAMKG (P2P)\nis our original model which retrieves English pas-\nsages given a non-english passage. Results tell us\nthat 1) directly retrieval of keyphrases have poor\nretrieval performance. This is because it is hard\nto capture the similarity between non-english pas-\nsages and english keyphrases; 2) RAMKG (P2PK)\nhas slightly worse results than the model , which\nimplies that additionally adding keyphrases in the\nretrieval targets does not bring any benefit.\nA.3 Discussion on Retriever-Generator\nIterative training (RGIT) Algorithm\nDifference between RGIT and Self-Training.\nOur approach shares some similarities with self-\ntraining (Lee, 2013; Pham et al., 2021) but there\nare some differences. In self-training, the teacher\nand student models are in the same architecture\nand focus on the same training objectives. In our\nproposed retriever-generator iterative training, the\nretriever and generator are two different models\nand optimized by different objectives.\nThreshold Tuning. In this section, we investi-\ngate the impact of the chosen threshold τ (line 24)\nin our proposed retriever-generator iterative train-\ning. We tune the threshold (tau) on AcademicMKP\nand results are shown in Table 7. Results show\n1245\nthat tau=5 receives the best retrieval performance.\nTau=0 brings more pseudo parallel passage pairs\nbut introduces more noise. Larger tau (10/15) re-\nduces the number of pseudo pairs, making the iter-\native training less effective.\n1246",
