Introduction \n \nCalibration of an instrument current transformer (CT) is commonly performed by \ncomparison with a reference current transformer by using a current transformer test set \n(CTTS). Basically, the ratio error ( ε) and phase displacement ( δ) of a CT against a reference \nCT with the same ratio is determined by direct comparison of their secondary currents. Since \nthe reference CT is assumed to be ideal and error-free, a CTTS directly gives ratio and phase \ndifferences of two secondary currents as in-phase and quadrature errors of the tested CT  \n(Fig. 1a). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a)                           (b) \n \nFig. 1. (a) Basic CT calibration circuit with CTTS, (b) Calibration of a CTTS with R-C circuit application \n \n\n \nHüseyin Çaycı: A COMPLEX CURRENT RATIO DEVICE FOR T HE CALIBRATION OF CURRENT TRANSFORMER TEST SETS \n160 \nSince the traceability of CT calibrations is directly dependent on the CTTS, several direct \nand indirect methods have been developed for their calibrations. Measuring individual \ncomponents of a CTTS or inserting an R-C circuit between two input terminals of a CTTS \n(Figure 1b) are common methods for the calibration of electromechanical CTTSs. However, \nthese methods are not applicable for some CTTSs, particularly for those having electronic \ncircuits instead of passive components. \nHowever, a calibration system [1] based on the generation of error values would be \nsuitable for any type of CTTS. In this paper, a relatively practical and highly accurate \ncalibration setup is discussed. \n \n2. Theory of Operation \n \n2.1. Generation of calibration values  \n \nTwo isolated current signals with known ratio and phase differences are generated and \nevaluated by a three-phase current source, a wattmeter and an Electronically Compensated \nCurrent Comparator (ECCC). A current signal which is used for simulating the secondary \ncurrent of a reference CT, is generated by first phase of the PC-controlled current source and \napplied both to N input of the CTTS and to the ECCC as main primary winding. An in-phase \ncurrent signal which differs from reference signal by 0º or 180º is applied to one of the \nauxiliary windings of the ECCC. This current is adjusted via a home-made electronically \ncompensated current divider. Finally, a quadrature-phase current signal which differs from the \nreference signal by +90º or -90º is generated by another phase of the source and applied to the \nsecond auxiliary winding of the ECCC. The secondary winding, which has the same number \nof turns as the primary winding, will then induce a complex total of the primary and two \nauxiliary currents proportional to their number of turns.  \nThe ECCC has full isolation between the primary and secondary since it is necessary to \nground the N and X current signals on the CTTS safely. Any error desired for a CTTS \ncalibration can be obtained with the combination of a PC-controlled three-phase current \nsource, an ECCC and an electronically-compensated current divider (ECCD). \n \n2.2. Electronically-compensated current comparator \n \nThe compensated current comparator is a well-known highly accurate ratio standard [2]. \nConstruction of a hollow toroid core prevents almost all external unwanted electromagnetic \nfields to reach the detector core so that the detector can sense the unbalanced currents almost \nwithout error. Because of this physical advantage, current comparator based ratio standards \nhave been used in a wide range of applications. \nSeveral techniques have been developed to achieve error-free current transformations. \nRecently, the introduction of electronic circuitry is preferred because of its simplicity and \nsuccess in compensation. Use of electronic circuitry within the current comparator structure \nshowed that one could design a current transformer with errors not more than a few ppm [3]. \nA special electronically-compensated current comparator (Fig. 2, Fig. 3) has been \ndeveloped to use in a CTTS calibration system [4]. Similar to others, it has a detector core C \n3, \na detection winding N D , a hollow toroid core C 1 surrounding the detector core, a primary \nwinding N P and a secondary winding N S. \n \n \nMetrol. Meas. Syst. , Vol. XVIII (2011), No. 1, pp. 159-164  \n161 \n \n \nFig. 2. Electronically-compensated current comparator \n \nThen, two additional windings N C1 , N C2  with the same number of windings are wound  \ninside and outside the hollow toroid core, and connected to each other in series but inversely. \nTheir number of windings should not be the same as the secondary winding. Here, the dashed \nline E 1 represents a thin electrostatic shield (copper foil) surrounding the detector core and \nwinding. C 2 represents a thick magnetic shield surrounding all. The dashed line E 2 shown in \nthe figure represents a thick copper shield to prevent N C1 , the external compensation winding, \nfrom the stray fields of primary and secondary currents. \n \n \n \nFig. 3. Structure of the current comparator and its windings \n \nThe electronic circuitry is designed as a transconductance amplifier which amplifies the \nvoltage obtained from the detector winding and converts it into a current. It forces this current \nto the inner and outer compensation windings not only for compensation of the secondary \ncurrent but also for automatically zeroing the detection voltage,. \n \n3. Performance tests and verification \n \nThe errors and linearity of the ECCC was measured in the unity ratio mode and with a \nmaximum burden of 0.5 \nΩ. First, a commercial CTTS, with the ratio error and phase \ndisplacement measurement resolution of 1ppm, was used. However, because of its instability \nbelow currents of 0.5A (10% of nominal current), an auxiliary CCC-based detector was used. \nThe sensitivity of the auxiliary detector is ten times higher than that of the ECCC detector and \n \nHüseyin Çaycı: A COMPLEX CURRENT RATIO DEVICE FOR T HE CALIBRATION OF CURRENT TRANSFORMER TEST SETS \n162 \nit gives more stable results than the commercial CTTS with lower excitation currents. The \nmeasurement results from both CTTS and auxiliary CCC, at currents between 1% and 200% \nof nominal current 5A, are given in Table 1. \nFurther tests on the ECCC showed that the errors given in the table are inherent errors of \nthe ECCC. And, these inherent errors are almost phase errors which arise because of \ncapacitive interactions between the primary, secondary and outer compensation windings. \nSeveral additional tests have been performed not only to check the self-performance of the \nECCC but also for verification of the calibration system including the three-phase current \nsource and the ECCC.  \nThe electronically-compensated current comparator has 200 turns (T) primary and \nsecondary windings in a 1:1 ratio configuration. An additional 1T to the primary or secondary \nwindings will mean ±0.5% ratio difference between primary and secondary currents. \nHowever, ratio errors obtained with an additional winding on the primary side can be \ncompensated perfectly with the same configuration on the secondary or vice versa. \n \nTable 1. Calibration results of ECCC in 1:1 ratio. \n \nMeasured Relative Error  \nLoad 0.5 Ω Applied \nCurrent \nwith CTTS with CCC \nDetector \nIP Ratio error Phase \ndisplacement \nComposite \nerror \n10 A 1.3 ppm \n5 A 1.4 ppm \n2 A 1.7 ppm \n1 A 1.6 ppm \n0.5 A 1.6 ppm \n0.2 A 1.6 ppm \n0.1 A 1.2 ppm \n0.05 A \nε ≤ -1 ppm δ ≤ 2 µrad \n0.5 ppm \n \nAdditional or inverse windings up to 10T on the primary and secondary showed no \nsignificant additional error from 1% up to 200% of nominal current.  \nThen, such ratio errors obtained with the primary or secondary winding configurations \nwere tried to be compensated with auxiliary windings and appropriate currents applied from \nthe second phase of the current source. Since the basic amplitude accuracy of the source \ntogether with the reference wattmeter is below 100 ppm, a 1T compensation results in a \nnegligible error (less than 1 ppm). Appropriate tests with different winding configurations \nresult with errors not greater than 5 ppm.  \nSimilar tests were performed by using two auxiliary windings and ignoring any additional \nprimary or secondary windings. Any ratio error generated by a current from the second phase \nof the current source and by using one of the auxiliary windings was compensated \nsuccessfully, with currents applied from the third phase to the other auxiliary winding.  \nFinally, similar tests were performed for the verification of the system in generating the \nphase displacements. Since the phase accuracy of each phase is not worse than 100µrad \n(0.005º), the final errors will also be very low. Both ratio- and phase-related test results \nshowed a good agreement with the theoretical considerations. \n \nMetrol. Meas. Syst. , Vol. XVIII (2011), No. 1, pp. 159-164  \n163 \n3.1. Uncertainty budget of the calibration system  \n \nThe model function of the calibration system is divided into two as for ratio error and \nphase displacement, respectively. \nRatio error, \nεx:: In the current transformer calibration, secondary currents of the reference \ncurrent transformer and the current transformer to be calibrated are compared on a current \ntransformer bridge. The calibration of the current transformer bridge is performed by applying \ntwo secondary currents with known ratio error and phase displacement related to each other. \nConsequently, the ratio error of the current transformer bridge is defined by the following \nformula  (in ppm): \n 610 , SX SN \nSN \nI I \nI\n\u0000X\nε? −= ⋅  (1) \nwhere, ISX  is the amplitude value of the current signal to be calibrated and ISN  is the amplitude \nvalue of the reference current signal. \nThe model function of the system is then,  \n εx = εxi  - δεxRcal  - δεxRd  - δεxConfig ,  (2) \nwhere δεxRcal  is the parameter for ratio uncertainties of current comparator and wattmeter, \nδεxRd  is the drift effect of those references, and δεxConfig  is the effect of measurement setup \nincluding temperature, electromagnetic field effects etc. \nPhase displacement, δX: Phase displacement in the current transformer bridge is the phase \ndifference between the vectors of two current signals. It is denoted in radians or minutes.  \n The model function of the system is then, \n δx = δxi  - δδxRcal  - δδxRd  - δδxConfig ,  (3)  \nwhere δδxRcal  is the parameter for phase displacement uncertainties of current comparator and \nwattmeter, δδxRd  is the drift effect of those references, and δδxConfig  is the effect of measurement \nsetup including temperature, electromagnetic field effects etc.  \nAll uncertainty contributions for the developed current transformer test set calibration \nsystem are given in the following table. \n \nTable 2. Uncertainty budget of the calibration system for current transformer test sets. \n \nSource of Uncertainty \n \nStandard Uncertainty Probability \nDistribution \nContribution to the \nStandard Uncertainty \n (µA/A) (µrad)  (µA/A) (µrad) \nGenerating error values \n(wattmeter & divider) 2 5 Normal 2 5 \nCurrent Comparator \n(1:1 ratio & summing) 1 1 Normal 1 1 \nMeasurement setup <1 <1 Rectangular <1 <1 \nStandard Uncertainty of \nMeasurement <1 <1 Normal <1 <1 \nStandard Uncertainty (k=1) 2,3 5,1 \nStandard Uncertainty (k=2) 5 10 \n \nHere, the improvement in the calibration system by using a divider could easily be seen. \nThe uncertainty in the generation of phase error is directly related with the phase uncertainty \nof the wattmeter which could be 5µrad in the worst case. However, the uncertainty in \n \nHüseyin Çaycı: A COMPLEX CURRENT RATIO DEVICE FOR T HE CALIBRATION OF CURRENT TRANSFORMER TEST SETS \n164 \ngeneration of the ratio error is independent of the wattmeter uncertainty, and it could be \nreduced down to 2ppm which is the uncertainty of the electronically compensated current \ndivider. \n \n3. Conclusions \n \nAn automatic calibration system for current transformer test sets has been described. With \nthis method, any ratio error and phase displacement value could be generated automatically \nand nominal and test currents could be safely grounded in the test set. Because of its highly \naccurate ratio and phase error generating capability, any type of test set regardless of its \noperating principle could be calibrated. It is obviously seen that the errors in generating the \ndesired values will never affect the overall uncertainty of the calibration system more than  \n5 ppm and 5 µrad for ratio and phase error measurements, respectively. The overall \nuncertainty of the system is not more than 5 ppm for ratio and 10µrad for phase, independent \nof the measured ratio and phase error values including dividers. \nIn the future, it is planned to design a similar electronically compensated current \ncomparator to use it in a new calibration system for the 1A current range. Additionally, to \neliminate the instabilities of the designed ECCC below a certain percentage (<10%) of the \nnominal current, two auxiliary ECCCs will be designed, one for the 5A range and the other \nfor 1A. The nominal currents of those ECCCs will be 0.5A and 0.1A, respectively. \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThe assistance of the Power & Energy Laboratory staff in the construction of the CCC, in \nthe design and the adoption of the electronic circuit and in the testing of the ECCC is greatly \nappreciated. \nThis work is part of a research project entitled \"Investigation of Magnetic and Capacitive \nError Components of Current Transformers Together With Burden Effects and Development \nof Compensation Methods” supported by the scientific and technological research projects \nsupport program (1001), sponsored by The Scientific and Technological Research Council of \nTurkey (TÜB \nİTAK) (grant # 109E097), and by National Metrology Institute of Turkey \n(UME) (grant # G1LV-E9-04-A). \n \nReferences \n \n[1] Ramm, G., Roeissle, G., Latzel, H.G.
