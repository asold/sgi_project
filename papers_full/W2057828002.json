However, to date, the variety of outcome measurement tools being used, and lack of\nknowledge about the measurement properties of some, compromise conclusions regarding the most effective\ninterventions.\nObjectives: This two-stage systematic review aimed to identify the tools used in studies evaluating interventions for anxiety\nfor high-functioning children with ASD in middle childhood, and then to evaluate the tools for their appropriateness and\nmeasurement properties.\nMethods: Electronic databases including Medline, PsychInfo, Embase, and the Cochrane database and registers were\nsearched for anxiety intervention studies for children with ASD in middle childhood. Articles examining the measurement\nproperties of the tools used were then searched for using a methodological filter in PubMed, and the quality of the papers\nevaluated using the COSMIN checklist.\nResults: Ten intervention studies were identified in which six tools measuring anxiety and one of overall symptom change\nwere used as primary outcomes. One further tool was included as it is recommended for standard use in UK children’s\nmental health services. Sixty three articles on the properties of the tools were evaluated for the quality of evidence, and the\nquality of the measurement properties of each tool was summarised.\nConclusions: Overall three questionnaires were found robust in their measurement properties, the Spence Children’s\nAnxiety Scale, its revised version – the Revised Children’s Anxiety and Depression Scale, and also the Screen for Child\nAnxiety Related Emotional Disorders. Crucially the articles on measurement properties provided almost no evidence on\nresponsiveness to change, nor on the validity of use of the tools for evaluation of interventions for children with ASD.\nPROSPERO Registration number:CRD42012002684.\nCitation: Wigham S, McConachie H (2014) Systematic Review of the Properties of Tools Used to Measure Outcomes in Anxiety Intervention Studies for Children\nwith Autism Spectrum Disorders.

Where tools are reliable and\nvalid, and outcomes important to children and families, the\nfindings can inform parents, clinicians, researchers, service\nproviders and policy makers about which interventions are most\neffective. However, to date the outcome measures used for\nintervention trials for children with autism spectrum disorder\n(ASD) are too varied to allow sensible decisions about what\ninterventions might be most effective [1;2].\nMeta-analyses can increase the power of findings by pooling\ndata from individual studies. For example, a meta-analysis of the\nRevised Children’s Manifest Anxiety Scale across 43 studies has\nfound evidence of validity and responsiveness to treatment [3].\nCross-study syntheses of outcome evidence such as this are much\nneeded in the field of ASD, because individual trials are in the\nmain very small and include broad age groups [4;5]. There have\nbeen discussions of these problems and suggestions of which\noutcome measures to use [6;7], but no widespread uptake in ASD\nstudies.\nThe focus of the current review is on how to choose appropriate\nand robust tools to measure outcomes of interventions for a\ncommon problem encountered by high-functioning children with\nASD – how to cope with symptoms of anxiety in the period of\nmiddle childhood. With around 40 per cent having symptoms at\nthe severity of an anxiety disorder [8], and the prevalence of ASD\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 January 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e85268\nbeing around 1 per cent [9], this is an important public health\nproblem. In the UK, a government initiative titled ‘Increasing\nAccess to Psychological Therapies’ (IAPT) [10] has since 2012\nbeen extended to children’s mental health services, with cognitive\nbehaviour therapy (CBT) for problems such as anxiety and\ndepression as one of the core strands. Outcome monitoring is\nembedded in the programme.\nIt is important to have a choice of reliable measurement tools\nfor a particular health condition in order to capture relevant\noutcomes, and different points of view including patient reported\noutcomes [11]. A choice of measurement tools also facilitates\nanswering a range of research questions, tailored to the objectives\nof the intervention, ideally meeting the needs of particular\ndevelopmental stages [12], and allowing different tools to be used\nfor study outcome evaluation and for selection criteria [13].\nWithout choice of appropriate tools the benefits of an intervention\nmay be missed or inflated [11;14].\nIn this systematic review, the tools used to measure outcomes\nin evaluations of clinical interventions for anxiety in children\nwith high-functioning ASD in middle childhood are identified\nand their quality assessed. Middle childhood is defined here as 8\nto 14 years of age during which time children will be entering\npuberty, beginning some level of personal independence from\ntheir parents, and experiencing transition between primary and\nsecondary school. We focus on high-functioning ASD as the\nchildren are likely to be able to participate in verbally-loaded\ninterventions such as CBT, even although the prevalence of\ncomorbid psychiatric conditions is similar across IQ and levels of\nadaptive behaviour [15]. This systematic review will facilitate\nrecommendations of robust tools for use in anxiety intervention\ntrials for children with high-functioning ASD in middle\nchildhood.\nThe review was conducted in two stages. In stage 1,\nidentification of tools was done by systematic search for literature\ndescribing studies of treatment interventions for anxiety in ASD in\nmiddle childhood. Then in stage 2, searches focused on the tools\nused to measure primary outcomes, and articles about these tools\nwere examined for evidence of appropriateness and measurement\nproperties.\nReview Methods: Stage 1\nThe review protocol was registered online with the International\nProspective Register of Systematic Reviews (Registration number:\nCRD42012002684) and can be accessed at (http://www.crd.york.\nac.uk/PROSPERO/prospero.asp). The protocol also pertains to\nsocial skills interventions, though only the anxiety interventions\nand outcome tools are reported here. Preferred Reporting Items\nfor Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) standards\nare followed in this report (see Checklist S1).\nSearch Strategy\nThe following electronic bibliographic databases were searched:\nMEDLINE, EMBASE, ERIC, PsycINFO, The Cochrane Library\n(Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central\nRegister of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Cochrane\nMethodology Register). The search strategy included the terms\nshown in Table 1 which were combined using database-specific\nfilters, where these were available. The search was restricted to\narticles in English, and those published between 1992 and\nFebruary 2013, the date when the last searches were run. The\nterm Asperger Syndrome was first included as a separate diagnosis\nin the WHO International Classification of Diseases in 1992 [16]\nso we expected separate identification of groups of children with\nability in the average range to be more frequent and consistent in\nstudies after this date.\nSelection Criteria\nAnxiety was clinically defined as in the International Classifi-\ncation of Diseases [16] and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual\nof Mental Disorders [17]. The interventions included cognitive\nand behavioural approaches, and excluded drug trials, physiolog-\nical interventions (e.g. biofeedback) and purely physical interven-\ntions (e.g. massage). Intervention studies where a broad range of\nskills were the target (e.g. social skills, or drama classes) were\nexcluded. The interventions included were ameliorative, preven-\ntative or educational, aimed at managing and regulating emotional\nreactions which may be precursors to anxiety disorder.\nStudies were included when over 50% of participants were aged\n8 to 14 years old, or the mean age of the ASD sample was within\nTable 1.Stage 1 review search terms.\n1.

Where child participants had a\nrange of differing diagnoses, the study was included if ASD\noutcome data were presented separately, and if half or more of\nparticipants have ASD.\nGroup studies with designs including before-and-after, con-\ntrolled trials, quasi-experimental, and randomised controlled trials\n(RCT) were included. Studies which used only observational\nmethods of recording outcomes (e.g. event recording) were\nexcluded. The review was restricted to articles published in English.\nOne reviewer (SW) screened the titles and abstracts of articles;\nwhere there was doubt whether an article met the inclusion criteria\nit was included. Full text sifting was by one reviewer (SW); any\nambiguous papers were discussed with the second reviewer (HM)\nto reach consensus. The references of the selected articles were\nsearched.\nData extraction\nData extraction was performed by one reviewer (SW) using a\npreviously tested data extraction form. The following information\nwas noted: participant characteristics, focus of intervention,\noutcome tools used, domains captured, and by whom the tool\nwas reported/measured.\nResults: Stage 1\nThe searches retrieved 750 articles from which 10 articles were\nretained [18–27]. See Figure 1 for search strategy flow diagram.\nNine articles report on seven RCTs of adapted CBT for anxiety\ndelivered to high-functioning children with ASD in middle\nchildhood. These studies varied in sample size from 22 to 71\nparticipants, used varied approaches and materials, and included\nfrom 6 group sessions [26] to 16 group [23] or individual sessions\n[19–21]. The before-and-after study included 6 participants in 16\ngroup sessions of CBT [25]. All but two [23;25] included training\nfor parents. Taken together the studies provide encouraging\nevidence that CBT can be efficacious for children with ASD and\nanxiety disorder.\nSeven different primary outcome tools were used in these\nstudies. The Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule (ADIS) [28] is\na clinician-administered interview. Five are parent and self-report\nchild anxiety questionnaires [29–33]. One further tool is a\nclinician or researcher rating of overall improvement, the Clinical\nGlobal Impressions – Improvement (CGI-I) [34]. No intervention\nstudies meeting our inclusion criteria used the Revised Children’s\nAnxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS) [35]; however as it is an\nIAPT recommended outcome tool it was also included in stage 2\n(Table 2). None of the tools was developed specifically for children\nwith ASD. All of the tools were developed in English (though at\nstage 2 some articles evaluating the measurement properties of the\nSCARED were on revised versions developed in Dutch).\nReview Methods: Stage 2\nIn order to assess the measurement properties of the tools, a\ncomprehensive search was conducted using a methodological\nFigure 1.

The checklist considers 9 properties of measure-\nment, each with multiple items rated on a 4 point scale: internal\nconsistency, reliability, measurement error, content validity,\nstructural validity, hypothesis testing, criterion validity, respon-\nsiveness to change (and cross-cultural validity, not considered in\nthe present review). For each article, the properties addressed are\ngiven an overall rating of excellent, good, fair, poor based on the\nlowest item rating awarded [37]. The checklists were completed by\none reviewer (SW) with frequent discussion of ratings with a\nsecond reviewer (HM) to reach consensus. To check reliability the\nsecond reviewer independently rated 10% of the articles using the\nchecklist. Agreement on final rating of each property was 71.5%.\nEvidence Synthesis\nThe quantitative findings in each study were then given a\nquality rating of positive, indeterminate or negative for each\nmeasurement property examined [38]. For example, internal\nconsistency is considered positive where Cronbach’s alpha is equal\nto or greater than 0.70; criterion validity is considered positive\nwhere there are convincing arguments that the gold standard is\n‘gold’ and correlation is equal to or greater than 0.70.\nFinally the quality ratings for the findings were considered in\nconjunction with the quality rating for the level of evidence in the\narticles about each tool [38]. This synthesis recordsstrong evidence\n(+++ or 222) where several methodologically good articles, or\none excellent article, find consistent evidence for or against a\nmeasurement property; moderate evidence (++ or 22) for several\nmethodologically fair, or one good study; a rating oflimited (+ or 2)\nfor one study of fair quality; and otherwise a rating ofconflicting\nevidence (+/2)o r unknown (?) evidence [38].\nResults: Stage 2\nThe search in PubMed produced 1096 articles from which 63\nwere retained for data extraction (Figure 2). The study population\ncharacteristics for these articles are shown in Table 3.\nOnly four articles assessing measurement properties included an\nASD sample, reporting on use of five of the tools (i.e. not RCADS,\nRCMAS or CGI). The majority of the studies were carried out in\nthe USA. The methodological quality of each article is presented\nin Table 4. None of the articles had looked at measurement error,\nso this property is not included in the table. Only one article\nreported responsiveness to change. The synthesised evidence on\nthe quality of the measurement properties of the individual tools is\nshown in Table 5. To aid interpretability [39], it is important to\nhave evidence on differences in scores between subgroups\n(including normative data) and this was available in many of the\narticles; however, no article reported on levels of minimal\nimportant change, nor on floor and ceiling effects.\nThe ADIS is a clinical interview, with entry-level questions\nwhich determine which areas of anxiety disorder are explored.\nThe recommended procedure is that parent and child are\ninterviewed separately, and then the interviewer determines the\ndisorder diagnoses and clinical severity rating. When the separate\ninterviews are compared, agreement is low both at the level of\nwhether a disorder is indicated and at symptom level (though one\nstudy [42] found the latter to be higher).

In many studies\nADIS is used as the ‘gold standard’ against which questionnaire\nmeasures are compared. Its strengths lie in inter-rater reliability,\nand evidence also of test-retest reliability.\nTurning to the questionnaire measures, evidence for internal\nconsistency of the parent and child versions of the SCAS was\nstrong for total and subscale scores, apart from the fear of physical\ninjuries subscale [33;40;94;95] and generalised anxiety disorder\n(GAD) subscale [40]. Test-retest reliability for child report was\nr = .60 [33] at 6 months, and r = .63 at 3 months [94] which seems\nacceptable (the COSMIN criterion of r$0.80 may be set unduly\nhigh for a subjective measure of feelings).\nEvidence for the structural validity of the six factor structure for\nthe SCAS child version was strong [33;91;94], though lower for\nthe parent version the confirmatory factor analysis finding only\nacceptable evidence of fit [98] (root mean square error of\napproximation (RMSEA) = .075) [92]. Criterion validity of the\nSCAS was supported by significantly higher scores in a clinical\nthan a non-clinical group [33;92;95], more than 80% of those with\nan anxiety disorder correctly classified, and discrimination\nbetween disorders good apart from GAD and panic-agoraphobia\n[92]. Convergent and divergent validity were demonstrated by\nsignificantly higher correlations between the child report SCAS\nand RCMAS than with the Child Depression Inventory (CDI)\n[33;94]; and furthermore by significantly higher correlations\nbetween SCAS parent and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL)\ninternalising than externalising scales [92], and higher between\nSCAS child and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire\nemotional subscale than with the conduct or hyperactivity\nsubscales [91].\nFindings for parent-child agreement for the SCAS depended on\nthe analysis conducted. Using ANOVA, it was found that parents\nrated significantly higher than children on all subscales apart from\nOCD and panic-agoraphobia [93]. In contrast, studies reporting\ncorrelations [40;95;96] consistently found r ..50 on total and\nsubscale scores, apart from on GAD [40].\nThe RCADS was developed as a revision of the SCAS, in order\nto correspond to dimensions of several DSM-IV anxiety disorders\nand also to include major depression. In particular, it was intended\nto refine the measurement of GAD to reflect core aspects of\n‘worry’. Internal consistency was found to be good for subscales,\nand also for the shortened Anxiety 15 item version. In the original\nstudy [35] one week test-retest reliability ranged from r = .65 to\n.80. The total variance explained by the factor analysis was less\nthan 50%; however, subsequent confirmatory factor analyses have\nreported good fit to the 6 factor solution [52;62;66] for the child\nscale, and acceptable for the parent scale [63;64]. Convergent and\ndivergent validity have been shown convincingly, as has criterion\nvalidity with diagnoses based on standardised clinical psychiatric\ninterview.\nThe MASC has well-established strengths in internal consisten-\ncy (except for the subscale Harm Avoidance in [55]) and in test-\nretest reliability. The latter has been shown at 3 weeks [56;57] and\nFigure 2.

The original factor analysis [56] for the\nMASC explained only 39.4% of the total variance; however,\nsubsequent confirmatory factor analyses have found good fit for\nthe four factor solution [51;52;54] though one study [59] found\nonly acceptable evidence of fit (e.g. RMSEA = 0.73) [98].\nCorrelations with other measures of anxiety are high, with\ndiscriminant validity established (usually by lower agreement with\nscales measuring depression). Findings for criterion validity have\nbeen variable, showing high levels of agreement with diagnostic\ngroupings (diagnostic interview or ADIS as ‘gold standard’) in\nsome community [50;54] and clinical studies [59;60;49– except for\ngeneralised anxiety disorder], but not in other clinical studies\n[55;58] and in the school-based study by Dierker and colleagues\n[53] where generalised anxiety disorder was well predicted in girls,\nbut social phobia and specific phobia were not. As for ADIS and\nSCARED (below), agreement between child and parent report was\nlow [51;60;61]; In the MASC source paper [56] mother-child\nagreement was only r = .39, and father-child and father-mother\nagreement were negligible.\nArticles generally report high internal consistency of the\nRCMAS but often do not give figures for the subscales. Only\none study reported test-retest reliability, which was high (one week\nr = .88; five week r = .77). One study hypothesised stability of\nscores for psychiatric inpatients over a 4 week period, but instead\nfound reduction in anxiety not substantiated by clinical rating\n[70]. Both content validity and structural validity appear strong.\nThe latter has been examined in a number of ways, with several\nstudies considering congruence of factors and their relationships\nacross parent/child or different ethnic groups. However, one small\nstudy of children with learning disability [72] reported a lower\nproportion of variance accounted for by the general anxiety factor\nthan was found in the normative sample. Some RCMAS articles\nsuggested convergent and divergent validity, but the better quality\nstudies found less convincing results. The one study to compare\nRCMAS child report with parent (parents completed the Revised\nBehavior Problem Checklist) found significant disagreement [69].\nThe two studies of criterion validity against diagnostic interview\nproduced conflicting results; the clinic study supported criterion\nvalidity [73] but the community study concluded that the RCMAS\nwas less successful than the MASC in identifying anxiety and\ndepression [53].\nThere are a number of versions of the SCARED. The original\n38 and 41 item tools have good content validity being derived\nfrom DSM [31], some evidence of test-retest reliability for total\nand subscale scores on both parent and child versions [31], plus\nconsistently good internal reliability. Good structural validity was\nfound [82] though evidence for measurement invariance was not\nas strong (RMSEA ..06) [81]. Criterion validity was good\n[78;81]: clinically anxious children scored significantly higher on\nthe child SCARED than non-anxious, depressed and disruptive\ngroups on total and subscale scores [79;83], and by examining\narea under the curve (AUC) against clinical interview [78;83].\nThe SCARED-Revised is a 66 item measure with nine\nsubscales. Internal consistency was found to be good though the\nquality of the articles varied. The total scores and most of the\nsubscales had good internal consistency, except OCD (parent and\nchild versions), blood/injection/injury (child) and environmental/\nsituational (parent) [85] and specific phobias [84]. Test-retest\nreliability of the child total score was positive (r..80) with the\nsubscales approaching this level apart from GAD, separation,\nOCD and traumatic stress (r,.70) [85]. Correlations across time\nwith the State Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children demonstrated\nresponsiveness to change though the quality of the evidence was\nlimited [87]. Significantly higher SCARED-R scores were\npredictive of those with anxiety disorders, demonstrating criterion\nvalidity, though the GAD, specific phobias and separation anxiety\nsubscales performed less well in the child version [86]. Correla-\ntions between parent and child were mixed with both high [86]\nand low [85] agreement found.\nThe SCARED-71 is a version adding five further social phobia\nitems to the SCARED-R. Internal consistency was positive in\nparent and child versions for total and all but one subscale scores\n(OCD, child report) [89]. Criterion validity in terms of predict-\nability of diagnosis by corresponding subscale was good except for\nTable 3.Cont.\nMeasure Article Ref No.\nStudy\nPopulation/sample\nMean age (SD)\nyears; range N\nMale %\n(child) Country\nSpence (2003) 94 General population 13.51 (0.51); 13–14 875 54 Australia\nWhiteside & Brown\n(2008)\n95 Community 12.74 (2.35); 9–18 85 55 USA\nAnxiety disorders 13.21 (2.81); 9–18 85 55\nWhiteside et al (2012) 96 Community 10.42 (1.5); 8–13 420 49 USA\nAnxiety disorders 12.81 (3.1); 7–18 196 52\nSWQ Bailey et al (2006) 78 Primary care 14.5 (1.27); 8–17 190 51 USA\nRussell & Sofronoff\n(2005)\n93 AS; clinically\nanxious and\nnormative data\nX (X); 10–13 65 (AS) 84.6 Australia\nCGI Lewin et al (2012) 97 OCD 12.2 (2.5); X 71 36.6 USA\nADIS: Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule.

However, correlations with ADIS parent report were\nlow, for both anxiety disorder and ASD groups [89].\nThe parent version of the Social Worries Questionnaire has\ngood evidence of criterion validity with agreement for social\nphobia (AUC..80) as measured by the ADIS [78]. Parent reports\non the SWQ also demonstrated that children with Asperger\nsyndrome were significantly more anxious than typically develop-\ning children, on a par with a clinically anxious sample. As\npredicted by Russell and Sofronoff, parent and child reports of\nanxiety differed [93].\nThe CGI-I showed inter-rater agreement for parent-child,\ntherapist-parent, therapist-child, and independent evaluator-\nparent though most of the correlations were,.70. Across time,\nimprovement was reported significantly sooner by parents and\nchildren than by therapists and the independent evaluator,\nthough judgements tended to converge by 14 weeks of treatment\nfor OCD.\nDiscussion\nPrincipal Findings\nIn this systematic review, eight tools were found which had been\nused to measure primary outcomes in anxiety intervention trials\nfor children with high-functioning ASD in middle childhood. A\nsecond systematic search of literature found sixty-three articles\nstudying children and examining the measurement properties of\nthe eight tools.\nThere was limited or no evidence for three of the eight\nproperties of measurement tools rated in this review using the\nCOSMIN checklist: measurement error, content validity and\nresponsiveness to change. In terms of the primary purpose of the\nreview – to inform the choice of tool to measure outcomes of\nintervention trials for anxiety in children with ASD – these are\nserious limitations in the evidence.\nOnly four articles included children with ASD, and none of\nthese considered content validity. Indeed, the field is hampered by\nlack of a definitive conceptualisation of anxiety in ASD, and the\nmeans to capture features of anxiety as a clinical disorder separate\nfrom ASD [15;99–102]. Anxiety interacts with core symptoms\n(such as poor social skills and repetitive thoughts) and so differs in\nseveral ways from anxiety seen in typically developing children.\nFor example, a child with ASD who is reluctant to go to school is\nmore likely to be experiencing social anxiety rather than\nseparation anxiety. However, until basic psychometric work\nincluding content analysis is carried out, outcome measures\ndeveloped with typically developing children will continue to be\nutilised with children with ASD [100;101].\nThe lack of evidence about responsiveness to change of tools is\nalso a limitation for the purpose of the review. The CGI\nImprovement rating explicitly focuses on change, and was\nutilised by three of the ASD intervention studies, indicating\ntreatment effects. It has been used widely in autism medication\ntrials [6], has comparable effect sizes to other rating scales in\nadult anxiety intervention trials [103], and has the advantage\nthat it can be rated blind to group and time point. Therefore it is\nlikely to continue to be used in intervention trials for children,\neven though evidence for its measurement properties was sparse\nin this review.\nOne further property included in the COSMIN checklist was\nnot included in the review, cross-cultural validity.

The weakness of the\nmeasurement of GAD by the SCAS appears to have been\nimproved in the RCADS. However, self-report and parent report\ngenerally have the limitation in RCTs of therapy that they are\nnot ‘blinded’. In the four ASD intervention trials which used\nADIS, participants were asked not to unblind the researcher as\nthey described current events and behaviours in the clinical\ninterview. Thus a combination of ways of measuring anxiety\n(feelings and behaviours) appears to be necessary to achieve\nrobust measurement.\nClinical Implications\nThe review found a mixed picture in terms of the level of\ncorrelation between parent and child report. Agreement is not\nnecessarily to be expected, with each individual reflecting different\nsymptoms captured (for example, more observable behaviours\nbeing identified by the parent), and the possible influence of factors\nsuch as the parent’s own experiences affecting sensitivity to the\nchild’s symptoms [105]. While the level of agreement between\nparents and their children with ASD may actually be higher than\nobserved for typically developing groups [106], a number of\nresearchers [e.g. 26;61;93] comment that children with high\nfunctioning ASD are likely to under-report anxiety symptoms, one\nreason being difficulty in identifying their own (and others’)\nemotions. Therefore a combination of perspectives is likely to give\na more rounded picture.\nOne further issue for the measurement of outcomes in\nintervention trials and clinical practice in ASD is a need to\nconsider further what constitutes a successful outcome [13].\nNecessarily, the tools reviewed here as primary outcomes focus\non clinical symptoms; however, the goals of intervention are\nlikely to include broader constructs such as participation and\nquality of life. The International Classification of Functioning,\nDisability and Health paradigm [107], which is the World\nHealth Organisation recommended conceptual model for mea-\nsuring health and disability and evaluating interventions,\nemphasizes that body functions, activity and participation may\nall be important indicators of intervention success. Children with\nASD may have hypersensitivity to visual and auditory stimuli,\nwhich in turn may result in activity limitations (e.g. social\nanxiety) and restricted social participation (e.g. reluctance to go\nto new places). Effective interventions for anxiety would also\nexpect to see change in socially valid outcomes for children such\nas new experiences and greater success in friendships, whatever\nthe nature of the baseline anxiety.\nLimitations\nThis systematic review had some limitations. Articles were\naccessed only in English as we lacked resources for translation.\nData extraction was done only in part by two independent\nreviewers. Although the COSMIN manual and checklist is\nvalidated and well structured, there is still an element of\nsubjectivity in the review process such that different decisions\nregarding ratings and synthesis might be made by other\nreviewers.\nThe focus was on children in middle childhood who are high-\nfunctioning, and anxiety measurement issues in other age and\nability groups have not been considered. Nevertheless, children\nTable 5.Cont.\nMeasurement properties Interpretability\nTool Version\nInternal\nConsistency Reliability\nContent\nValidity\nStructural\nValidity\nHypothesis\nTesting\nCriterion\nValidity Responsiveness\nDifferences in scores\nbetween subgroups\nPar/ch ** Conv/div ***\nClinical Global\nImpressions (CGI)\nCGI-I na + na na na na na na na\nC = child self report; P = parent report.

The\nreview has allowed some conclusions to be drawn on what may\nbe the psychometrically sound assessment tools. However, there\nrequires to be further consideration of how to achieve blinded\noutcome measurement in RCTs, and how to judge the\nappropriateness of tools developed to measure anxiety in typically\ndeveloping children when applied with children who have ASD.\nSupporting Information\nChecklist S1 PRISMA checklist.\n(DOC)\nAcknowledgments\nWe are grateful to Dr Caroline Terwee for training in the COSMIN\nmethodology, and to Denise Brett for formatting references.\nAuthor Contributions\nConceived and designed the experiments: SW HMcC.
