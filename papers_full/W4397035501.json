  "abstract": "The paper explores the transformative potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), in the pharmaceutical industry for drug discovery. It highlights the significant impact of AI in speeding up and reducing the costs of drug development, offering more precise and efficient methodologies for creating tailored therapies. The collaboration between healthcare providers and data scientists is emphasized as crucial for implementing LLMs in healthcare to improve patient outcomes. The document discusses various applications of AI in the drug discovery process, including open -source developments, the use of big data, and the creation of neural networks to predict drug target interactions and optimize lead compounds. It suggests that AI's integration into pharmaceutical research promises more effective treatment options and a revolution in patient care, despite potential challenges such as data privacy and ethical considerations.",
