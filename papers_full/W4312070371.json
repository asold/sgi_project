    "abstract": "The purpose of image dehazing is to remove the interference from weather factors in degraded images and enhance the clarity and color saturation of images to maximize the restoration of useful features. Single image dehazing is one of the most important tasks in the field of image restoration. In recent years, due to the progress of deep learning, single image dehazing has made great progress. With the success of Transformer in advanced computer vision tasks, some research studies also began to apply Transformer to image dehazing tasks and obtained surprising results. However, both the deconvolution-neural-network-based dehazing algorithm and Transformer based dehazing algorithm magnify their advantages and disadvantages separately. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel Transformer–Convolution fusion dehazing network (TCFDN), which uses Transformer’s global modeling ability and convolutional neural network’s local modeling ability to improve the dehazing ability. In the Transformer–Convolution fusion dehazing network, the classic self-encoder structure is used. This paper proposes a Transformer–Convolution hybrid layer, which uses an adaptive fusion strategy to make full use of the Swin-Transformer and convolutional neural network to extract and reconstruct image features. On the basis of previous research, this layer further improves the ability of the network to remove haze. A series of contrast experiments and ablation experiments not only proved that the Transformer–Convolution fusion dehazing network proposed in this paper exceeded the more advanced dehazing algorithm, but also provided solid and powerful evidence for the basic theory on which it depends.",
