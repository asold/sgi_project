    "abstract": "In this paper, a new approach to build a dual-band impedance transformer is presented. The transformer can handle impedances that are complex and vary with frequency. This transformer contains a Pi-section structure, which can be equivalent to having two difierent electrical lengths at the two operating frequencies. One of the electrical lengths serves as complementary angle of the other. In this way, the conjugate impedances obtained through previous process are transformed to real impedance concurrently. All parameters are derived from closed-form equations. In addition, several simulations as well as a fabricated power amplifler (PA) are presented to verify the proposed transformer. The measured result performs a good agreement with the simulated one in return loss and gain. This transformer may flnd use in difierent stages of a transceiver such as power ampliflers which operate at two independent frequencies.",
