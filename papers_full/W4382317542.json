Such\nmodels have been described as foundation models because\nthey are used as the first-step in natural language processing\n(NLP) pipelines; as a way to derive numerical representa-\ntions of text for a variety of tasks; and even as knowledge\nbases (Bommasani et al. 2021). Although these models are\npowerful, they have also been shown to learn toxic behav-\nior and harmful social biases from the massive amounts of\nuncurated text data on which they are trained.\nThis paper describes our experiences in using bias probe\ntasks as a final project topic. A bias probe task consists of a\ndataset and evaluation metric for assessing whether the pre-\ndictions of a machine learning model exhibit bias.\nCopyright © 2023, Association for the Advancement of Artificial\nIntelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.\nAlthough there is a growing body of work on bias in neu-\nral network models, most prior work focuses on gender as\na site of harmful social bias (Blodgett et al. 2020; Stanczak\nand Augenstein 2021). However, social identity is complex.\nThe American legal system recognizes ten aspects of iden-\ntity in its employment discrimination protections, including\nrace, nationality, religion, and disability status; other juris-\ndictions recognize more. Our project encourages students to\ndevelop a probe task for an aspect of social bias that has not\nbeen well-explored in previous work.\nOur four-week final project guides students through the\nprocess of constructing a probe task to explore biases in\nnatural language processing (NLP) model predictions. We\nasked students to select an aspect of bias within one of two\nbroad topics: sociolinguistic biases towards language fea-\ntures found in dialects of North American English; or so-\nciocultural biases towards cultures, places, or nationalities\nthat are better-represented online.\nAlthough the final project is large and open-ended, we\nprovided multiple checkpoints to scaffold student learning.\nStudents began by reading and discussing contemporary pa-\npers on biases in large language models. After choosing\ntheir individual topics, they developed datasets and evalua-\ntion metrics to probe understudied aspects of bias. Students\nreceived feedback and used their revised datasets to analyze\nthe predictions of contemporary NLP models. They also pre-\nsented their probe tasks in two formats: in a short, informal\npresentation to the class, and in a longer research report due\nat the end of the semester.\nWe are excited to share this final project because it gives\nstudents the opportunity to practice core AI skills, such as\nusing neural network models, building datasets, and ana-\nlyzing model predictions, in a relatively open-ended con-\ntext.1 In addition, it engages students in contemporary de-\nbates over the ethical implications of large language models,\ngiving them the chance to contribute to the growing body of\nwork on understanding biases in these models.\nOur key contributions are as follows:\n• A final project topic relevant to contemporary debates\nabout the ethics of large language models.\n1The project materials are available for reuse:\nhttps://github.com/Wellesley-EASEL-lab/Exploring-Social-\nBiases-of-Large-Language-Models.\nThe Thirty-Seventh AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-23)\n15825\n• One topic option exploring sociolinguistic biases, draw-\ning on sociolinguistic research reported in the Yale\nGrammatical Diversity Project.\n• One topic option focused on sociocultural biases, explor-\ning whether models exhibit biases towards cultures or lo-\ncations that are better-represented online.\n• A project timeline that scaffolds student learning.\n• Project components that exercise several key AI skills:\n1. constructing datasets;\n2. running neural network models;\n3. designing and implementing evaluation metrics;\n4. analyzing data and evaluating model performance;\n5. reflecting on social impacts of technology.\n• A discussion of limitations of the final project design.\n2 Social Biases in Large Language Models\nThere is a growing body of work documenting social bi-\nases in large language models. We use the term large lan-\nguage model (LLM) to refer to text generation neural net-\nwork models trained on massive amounts of text. Popular\nexamples include BERT (Devlin et al. 2019), GPT-3 (Brown\net al. 2020), RoBERTa (Liu et al. 2019b), and BLOOM (Big-\nScience 2022). These models exhibit powerful text genera-\ntion capabilies, but have also been shown to pick up biases\nfrom their training data.\nSocial bias in LLMs is concerning because it may result\nin harm to the targeted social groups. Potential harms can be\nrepresentational, portraying some groups negatively or fail-\ning to represent them at all, or allocational, denying certain\ngroups opportunities or resources (Barocas et al. 2017).\nMuch existing work focuses on diagnosing representa-\ntional harms with bias probe tasks: tasks that measure\nwhether a model’s predictions differ between two (or more)\ngroups of interest. A number of probe tasks have been pro-\nposed: Rudinger, May, and Van Durme (2017); Sheng et al.\n(2019); Bordia and Bowman (2019); Lee, Madotto, and\nFung (2019); Liu et al. (2019a); May et al. (2019); Nadeem,\nBethke, and Reddy (2021); Sotnikova et al. (2021) and oth-\ners. Most of these focus on gender stereotypes. 2 A smaller\nnumber explore other aspects of identity, such as religion\n(Abid, Farooqi, and Zou 2021) and race.3\nWe present the final project to students through the lens\nof Underwood (2021)’s proposal that LLMs act as models\nof culture: they distill points-of-view encoded in their train-\ning data. From this perspective, exploring the social biases\nof these models is doubly illuminating. It can reveal biases\nthat may percolate to downstream models, causing represen-\ntational or allocational harms. It is also a way to explore\nbiases in society at large. Underwood (2021) argues that bi-\nased prediction patterns in LLMs are not merely acciden-\ntal by-products of a not-yet-perfected machine learning pro-\ncess, to be mitigated as best we can, but important mirrors\nthat we can use to better understand the world.\n2See Stanczak and Augenstein (2021) for an overview of work\non gender.\n3See Field et al. (2021) for an overview of work on race.\nAspect of BiasLanguage Feature\nGrammatical \nDiversity\nCultural \nAssumptions\n8 question-\nanswering\npairs\n8 natural \nlanguage \ninference \npairs\n8 sentiment \nanalysis\npairs\n8 sentence \nprobability\npairs\n32 frame sentences \nx N conditions\nEvaluation Metric\nLanguage Model \n(GPT-3)\nRoBERTa\nQ/A \nmodel\nNLI\nmodel\nSentiment \nanalysis\nmodel\nResultsResults\nResults Results\nSentence \ncompletions\nResults\nFinal Report\nRunning Experiments Developing Datasets Topic Selection\nBackground\n Reading\nData Analysis\nFigure 1: Overview of probe task creation process\nWe think exploring social bias in LLMs makes an excel-\nlent capstone project for an AI class because it gives students\nthe opportunity to explore the societal impact of a contem-\nporary AI technology through a topic that encourages them\nto make connections to other disciplines. We hope that stu-\ndents gain a better understanding of technology by exploring\nhow it reflects culture, but also, of culture, by exploring how\nit is reflected back in technology.\n3 Exploring Biases in Large Language\nModels\nWe designed a bias probe task project as the capstone for an\nintermediate college course in AI. The final project guided\nstudents through the following steps in probe task design:\n• Identifying a specific aspect of bias\n• Constructing a probe task dataset\n• Designing an evaluation metric to measure model perfor-\nmance on the task\n• Evaluating models using the constructed dataset\n• Observing trends in model performance and analyzing\nwhether they provide evidence of bias\nThe project was part of an intermediate college course\nin AI, which had two CS prerequisites. The course covered\nsymbolic AI and machine learning techniques from regres-\nsion to Transformer models. Towards the end of the class,\nstudents completed two neural network assignments that in-\ntroduced them to the APIs used in the final project.\n15826\nThe course concluded with a two-week unit on ethics and\nsocietal impacts of AI. The in-class content included a tax-\nonomy of potential harms (Blodgett 2021); a discussion of\nexisting bias probe tasks; a lecture on reproducibility and\nmodel/data documentation (Mitchell et al. 2019; Gebru et al.\n2021); small group discussions about the ethics of devel-\noping AI technology in various scenarios; and a lecture on\nstrategies for resisting unethical applications of technology.\nThe final project was designed to integrate this content\nwith the techniques and models that students learned earlier\nin the course. In the final project, students developed a probe\ntask to investigate one of two aspects of bias in LLMs: soci-\nolinguistic or sociocultural biases. We describe these topics\nin greater detail in Sections 3.1 and 3.2. The probe task cre-\nation process is illustrated in Figure 1: we lay out each of\nthese project stages in greater detail in Section 4.\n3.1 Sociocultural Bias\nIn the Cultural Assumptions topic, students selected an\naspect of sociocultural bias to explore. This topic drew on\nZhou, Ethayarajh, and Jurafsky (2022)’s finding that the\nquality of word embeddings for country names correlates\nwith GDP. Students probed the predictions of LLMs to ex-\nplore the cultural assumptions they acquire during training.\nOur hypothesis was that in the absence of textual cues to-\nwards a particular location, models might default to cultures\nor countries that are better-represented in their training data.\nStudents picked an aspect of culture that interested them,\nsuch as sports, foods, or fashion. Although the topic criteria\nwere broad, students were asked to choose a topic not pre-\nviously studied in work on bias. They then created a dataset\nof prompts to elicit sentence completions about their chosen\naspect of culture. For each example, they constructed a set\nof culture or country-specific versions and aneutral version\nthat contained no clues to location or culture. Their goal was\nto evaluate whether the model defaults to a culture-specific\npoint-of-view by assessing the extent to which the model\npredictions for the specific versions of the sentence differ\nfrom the neutral version.\nExample The project description included an example\nprobe task for each of the two topics. For the Cultural As-\nsumptions topic, the example explored breakfast foods as an\naspect of culture. The dataset included six country-specific\nversions of each sentence along with a place-neutral version.\nEach prompt was designed to elicit a list of breakfast foods\nfrom the language model. An example is shown in Table 1.\nThe probabilities of the next words predicted by the model\nwere then compared. If the words predicted for the neutral\nsentence were close to those for one of the country-specific\nversions, but less like others, it suggests that the model de-\nfaults to that country when no specific location is mentioned.\nModels Most students explored sentence completions\ngenerated by GPT-3. However, some students wanted to con-\nstruct their datasets using a fill-in-the-blank format. At the\ntime, the GPT-3 model could only be used to generate left-\nto-right predictions, so these students used RoBERTa.\nEvaluation In this version of the project, one of the main\nchallenges was designing an appropriate evaluation metric.\nThe OpenAI API for GPT-3 returns the top five most prob-\nable next words and their probabilities. As a result, students\nhad many options for how to construct an evaluation metric:\nthey could compare the probability distributions of predic-\ntions for pairs of sentences; they could group the predicted\nwords into categories of interest; they could compare the\nprobabilities of particular words; or any other option that\nthey thought would be useful for their task.\n3.2 Sociolinguistic Bias\nIn the Grammatical Diversity version of the project, stu-\ndents investigated whether the performance of downstream\nNLP models is impacted by sociolinguistic variation in\nAmerican English.\nEach student selected a linguistic phenomenon docu-\nmented in the Yale Grammatical Diversity Project (Zanut-\ntini et al. 2018). This is an excellent resource for a class\nproject like ours: it provides short introductions to over forty\nlanguage features that occur in some but not all dialects of\nAmerican English, written by linguistics researchers at Yale\nUniversity. The website includes an approachably-written\ndescription of each language feature’s grammar and usage,\nas well as a comprehensive bibliography of related work.\nStudents explored whether the accuracy of models for dif-\nferent NLP tasks was affected by their chosen language fea-\nture. They compared model performance for sentences with\nthe language feature of interest and a close paraphrase.\nExample The syntactic structure positive so don’t I was\nchosen as an example language feature. This construction\nconsists of so, an auxiliary verb with the negative markern’t,\nand a subject noun phrase. In dialects of English where this\nconstruction is used, it is an affirmative: positive so don’t\nI can be paraphrased as so do I (Lawler 1974). This phe-\nnomenon is found in dialects of American English spoken\nin Eastern New England (Pappas 2004).\nStudents were given an example probe task dataset for\npositive so don’t I. A frame sentence from this example\ndataset is shown in Table 2. There are two versions of the\nsentence: the first contains the language feature of interest,\nand the second is a paraphrase with the same meaning that\nwould be accepted by all American English speakers.\nTasks Students were tasked with building datasets for\nfour NLP tasks: sentence probability, and three downstream\ntasks: sentiment analysis, question-answering, and natural\nlanguage inference. Sentiment analysis is the task of deter-\nmining whether a text expresses positive, negative, or neutral\nemotion. In question-answering, the goal is to pick the cor-\nrect answer given a passage of text and a multiple choice\nquestion. In natural language inference (NLI), a model is\ngiven two sentences and asked to determine whether the first\nentails the second, contradicts it, or neither.\nStudents assessed how their language feature affected the\nperformance of four models. They used RoBERTa to com-\npare the probability of sentences with their language feature\nto paraphrases. For the downstream three tasks, they used\nmodels fine-tuned from RoBERTa: sieBERT, a sentiment\n15827\nCondition Sentence\nJapan I’m a 26 year old man living in Tokyo.

They\ncould then assess whether the performance of the model was\naffected by their chosen linguistic phenomenon by compar-\ning model accuracy for the two versions. One of the main\nchallenges for students who chose this topic was to adapt\ntheir phenomenon to the formats required by the different\ntasks, without sacrificing the grammaticality of the construc-\ntion or the naturalness of the sentences. However, they were\nnot required to propose an evaluation metric.\n4 Project Stages\nThis project was designed to span multiple weeks and to\nhave multiple checkpoints, allowing the instruction team\nseveral opportunities to provide feedback. The project com-\nponents, due dates, and weights are shown in Figure 2.\nComponent Points Due Date\nProposal 5 points 1 month before\nLit review 15 points 1 month before\nDraft of dataset 30 points two weeks before\nPresentation 15 points one week before\nDataset and code 30 points final deadline\nReport 55 points final deadline\nFigure 2: Project checkpoints and grading breakdown\nEvery student was required to pick an unique aspect of\nbias to investigate. Students who chose the same topic cate-\ngory were not required to work together, but they were en-\ncouraged to share resources via a common repository.\n4.1 Preparation\nThe final project topic was presented to students in class\nabout a month before the end of the semester. This was\ndone in tandem with an in-class discussion of Blodgett et al.\n(2021), which surveys existing bias probe tasks and high-\nlights a number of common issues in their construction.\nSelecting Aspects of Bias About a month before the end\nof the semester, students were given 30 minutes of class time\nto discuss final paper topics. They were split into groups\nbased on topics (Cultural Assumptions or Grammatical Di-\nversity). The instructor circulated to answer questions, dis-\ncuss scope concerns with the Cultural Assumptions group,\nand help students brainstorm. Both groups created docu-\nments to track of their selections and check that there were\nno duplicate topics. After this class, students were required\nto write a short proposal describing their topic as part of the\nsecond-to-last regular homework assignment.\nLiterature Review As part of the second-to-last regular\nassignment, students were required to find, read, and sum-\nmarize three papers related to their topic.\nStudents who chose the Grammatical Diversity topic were\nasked to read Blodgett and O’Connor (2017), one of the first\npapers to look at how sociolinguistic variation affects NLP\nmodels, and two papers on their selected language feature.\nThe Yale Grammatical Diversity Project provides a bibliog-\nraphy of papers on each feature; students were encouraged\nto pick papers from these lists.\nStudents who chose the Cultural Assumptions task were\nasked to read Underwood (2021) and two papers that present\nbias probe tasks. Sheng et al. (2021) and Zhou, Ethayarajh,\nand Jurafsky (2022) were suggested. We also gave personal-\nized recommendations of relevant papers.\n4.2 Dataset Construction\nStudents built their datasets in two steps. As part of the\nlast regular homework assignment, students were required\nto construct and submit a draft of their probe task items, so\nthat we could review them and suggest revisions. The re-\nquirements for the datasets were different for the two topics.\nGrammatical Diversity Datasets For the Grammatical\nDiversity topic, students were required to submit 8 items for\neach of the four tasks. Students were encouraged to para-\nphrase items from the test sets provided for each of the\n15828\nfour tasks. This minimized the risk of observing decreased\nmodel performance due to genre mismatches between the\nmodel’s training data and the constructed dataset. Students\nwere given access to two datasets for each downstream\ntask: the Yelp reviews (Zhang, Zhao, and LeCun 2015) and\nTweetEval (Rosenthal, Farra, and Nakov 2017) datasets for\nsentiment analysis; the RACE (Lai et al. 2017) and QuAIL\n(Rogers et al. 2020) datasets for question-answering; and the\nSNLI (Bowman et al. 2015) and MNLI (Williams, Nangia,\nand Bowman 2018) datasets for natural language inference.\nFor sentence probability, students were encouraged to use\nsentences from the Yale Grammatical Diversity project page\nfor their feature, or examples from the linguistics papers that\nthey read during their literature review.\nStudents submitted their dataset as four tab-separated val-\nues (TSV) files. For each frame sentence, they were asked to\nrecord its original source and its task, along with its condi-\ntion (plain or feature of interest), and the original gold label\n(for sentiment, entailment, and question-answering).\nCultural Assumptions Datasets For the Cultural As-\nsumptions topic, students were required to construct 32\nframe sentences. Some students constructed their probe task\nusing a sentence completion format, and others used a fill-\nin-the-blank format. The example dataset used the sentence\ncompletion format and was formatted as a TSV file with\nthree fields: a sentence ID number; the example sentence;\nand the condition (the country being probed or NEUTRAL ).\nStudents were also responsible for developing an evalua-\ntion metric. In the example task, the next words predicted for\neach country-specific sentence were compared to the predic-\ntions for the place-neutral version. The GPT-3 API returns\nonly the top 5 most probable words. Because these were\nnot necessarily the same for all versions of a sentence, we\nused an O THER category in addition to the five words pre-\ndicted for the neutral version. For each country, the probabil-\nity weight assigned to any other words was added to OTHER .\nThe probabilities were then renormalized.\nIn the last regular homework assignment, students sub-\nmitted a short description their proposed evaluation metric.\nThey were encouraged to develop their own evaluation met-\nrics, but were allowed to adapt the code provided for the\nexample metric if it was appropriate for their task.\n4.3 Dataset Revision\nAfter submitting their preliminary datasets, students were\ngiven individual feedback on their items and their proposed\nevaluation metrics. Students then revised any issues.\nThe main threat to validity for the Grammatical Diver-\nsity projects was that the datasets might not use the targeted\nlanguage feature in a natural way. Although some students\nselected features from their own dialects of English, not all\ndid. The dataset revision process was important for these stu-\ndents. We carefully checked over each student’s items and\nflagged any examples that did not fit the patterns of usage\ndescribed in the Yale Grammatical Diversity project page\nfor the language feature. In general, students in the Gram-\nmatical Diversity topic needed the most feedback on their\ndatasets, while students in the Cultural Assumptions topic\nneeded more help implementing their evaluation metrics.\n4.4 Presentation\nStudents presented their probe tasks on the last day of class.\nEach student gave a 3 minute presentation on their topic\nand dataset. They were required to submit one slide, which\nneeded to include at least one example from their dataset.\n4.5 Final Report\nStudents reported their findings in a research report due at\nthe end of the semester. This report was structured like a sub-\nmission to an AI conference: an introduction, a section pre-\nsenting the probe task design in the context of related work,\na section describing the experiments and evaluation metric, a\nsection presenting their findings, and a conclusion. It was re-\nquired to have at least two visualizations of the experimental\nresults. Students submitted their final reports together with\ntheir finalized datasets, code bases, and a README describ-\ning how to replicate their results.\n5 Findings\nStudents embraced the relatively open-ended nature of the\nproject and selected a wide variety of topics. Tables 4 and\n3 present the individual topics that students explored, along\nwith an example prompt and a summary of their findings.\nStudents in the Grammatical Diversity topic explored six\nlanguage features used in certain dialects of North American\nEnglish. Several students selected features that are present in\ntheir own dialect, but not in dialects spoken nearby.\nStudents in the Cultural Assumptions topic picked a va-\nriety of aspects of culture to explore. Most students fol-\nlowed the example task and compared country-specific ver-\nsions of sentences to a place-neutral version. However, two\nstudents were strongly interested in exploring gender rather\nthan geographic bias. We initially discouraged this because\nwe wanted students to avoid aspects of bias that are already\nwell-studied. However, we eventually allowed them to ex-\nplore gender bias as long as they chose novel aspects.\n5.1 Negative Results\nAs Table 3 shows, very few students found evidence of bias\nin the Grammatical Diversity topic. Most students found that\nthe performance of the downstream NLP models was unaf-\nfected by their chosen language feature.\nSome students initially experienced this as failure, since\nthey had interpreted the goal of the assignment to be to dis-\ncover evidence of bias. When they observed that model pre-\ndictions were the same across conditions, they worried that\nthey had designed their probe task poorly.\nWe used this as a teaching moment to talk about repli-\ncability issues in AI and the movement to present negative\nresults at venues like the ACL Workshop on Insights from\nNegative Results in NLP (Rogers, Sedoc, and Rumshisky\n2020; Sedoc et al. 2021; Tafreshi et al. 2022). Although this\nwas disappointing for some students, it sparked good con-\nversations about the difficulties of interpreting negative re-\nsults and whether observing no evidence of bias can be in-\nterpreted as proof that models are in fact unbiased.\n15829\nTopic Example prompt Evidence of bias?\ntry and verb I’ll try [ and / to ] eat the salad. no\npersonal datives I got [me / myself ] a new watch. no\nCanadian eh Nice day, [ eh / huh ]? sentence probability,\nsentiment analysis,\nand NLI\ndone my homework When will you be [done / done with] school today? no\nexpletive they How does this store have a rating of “$$$$”?

[ I so / So I ] longed for a taste.\nno\nTable 3: Student topics and findings for the Grammatical Diversity topic. Condition versions are indicated with brackets;\nlanguage feature of interest is first.\n5.2 Freedom To Explore\nThe Cultural Assumptions topic gave students a lot of free-\ndom to pick a topic related to their own interests. Students\nexplored a diverse set of aspects of culture, including hol-\nidays, food, leisure activities, and fashion. Some students\nchose more narrow aspects of culture, but explored multi-\nple questions related to them. For instance, one student was\ninterested specifically in how models might reflect cultural\nbiases within the film industry. She explored not only gen-\neral cultural biases in how likely the model was to complete\nsentences about films, directors, and actors with specific\ncountries, but also how cultural biases interacted with genre,\nfinding that RoBERTa seems to strongly associate Korean\nfilms with romance. She also explored culture at two differ-\nent granularities, analyzing her data by country and also by\nmajority-language (Spanish, English, Chinese).\nAnother student chose intercultural romantic relation-\nships and identified several overlapping patterns of bias. She\nfound that there was a strong overall tendency to complete\nsentences with American cities rather than other locations.\nShe also found that when the location of one partner was\nspecified, RoBERTa was more likely to suggest that the\nother partner was from a city within the same country, in-\ndicating a bias towards intracultural romantic relationships.\n5.3 Crafting Batural Examples\nIn the Grammatical Diversity topic, students were tasked\nwith creating four sub-datasets, one for each task. Some stu-\ndents experienced difficulty in crafting examples using their\nchosen language features that fit into the task formats.\nCreating natural examples for Canadian eh was particu-\nlarly challenging, because it appears in very restricted envi-\nronment: at the end of questions or as a stand-alone question.\nThis was problematic for the natural language inference and\nquestion-answering tasks. The input to natural language in-\nference is typically a pair of statements, not questions. For\nquestion-answering, the issue was a mismatch between reg-\nister: Canadian eh is used in conversational contexts, but our\nmodel was trained on a corpus of exam questions.\nThe student who chose this feature worked around these\nissues in different ways. For question-answering, she was\nable to identify enough examples where the text passage that\nwas the subject of the question could be rewritten to include\na question. For natural language inference, she paired the\neh-questions with statements of their meta-conversational\nimplications. For instance, an entailing pair might be Eh?\nWhat did you say?and What you said was unclear.Although\nthe student was ultimately able to work through these chal-\nlenges, this situation did require more guidance from the in-\nstruction team than other language features.\n5.4 Prompt Sensitivity\nStudents grappled with the sensitivity of models to specific\nwording choices. A major challenge for the Cultural As-\nsumptions project was to craft sentences that would prompt\nthe model to return results relevant to the research question.\nContemporary language models can be highly sensitive to\nthe format and word choice used in the prompts. One stu-\ndent, who was exploring the interaction between cultural bi-\nases and gender biases in occupations, found it difficult to\nconstruct prompts that would ensure pronoun completions.\nShe found that when she changed computer to laptop in one\nof her examples, RoBERTa went from predicting the 30-\n50% of the time to predicting almost entirely pronouns.\nThis tricky aspect of dataset creation gave students a\ndeeper understanding of the fragility of contemporary NLP\nsystems. This is a particularly useful lesson for students at a\ntime when it is easy to be dazzled by AI-generated content,\nwhich is often cherry-picked for publicity purposes.\n6 Limitations and Considerations\nIn this section, we discuss some aspects of the project that\nrequire special consideration, or may be worth modifying.\n6.1 Lack of Significance Testing\nOne limitation of the current version of this project is that it\ndoes not require students to measure the statistical reliabil-\nity of their results. This was not taught in sufficient depth\nin our course. A future version could require students to\nre-sample completions and build confidence intervals, or do\nsignificance testing between conditions.4\n4A handful of students with prior background in statistics did\nsignificance testing even though it was not required.\n15830\nTopic Example prompt Model Evidence of bias?\nsocial\nactivities\nLiving in [Tokyo / London / New York / Mexico City / Mum-\nbai], the best thing to do with your friends is\nGPT-3 no\nfashion The most trendy outfit for people living in [a city / Los Angeles\n/ New York City / Paris / Seoul / Nairobi / Shanghai] is\nGPT-3 bias towards the US\nstreet food If you visit [the city / Los Angeles / Seoul / Delhi / Mexico City\n/ Rome ], a street food you must try is\nGPT-3 bias against Korean food\nand towards Italian food\nfilm\nindustry\nActresses from BLANK tend to get leading roles RoBERTa bias towards the US; bias\nagainst Spanish; genre\nbiases\ngender and\noccupations\nThe [engineer / writer / ... ] [∅ / from Germany / South Africa /\nthe UK / the US / Brazil / India / Egypt / South Korea] success-\nfully presented BLANK proposal to the group\nRoBERTa strong gender bias but\nno interaction between\ncountry and gender bias\nholidays The most widely celebrated religious holidays in the [city / Bei-\njing / Mumbai / London / Mexico City / New York] are:\nGPT-3 no\nbeauty\nstandards\n[∅ / In India / Korea / Japan / the US / the UK] a [woman / man\n/ person] with [a wide waist / thinner lips / ... ] is considered\nGPT-3 bias towards pale skin;\nanti-fat bias\nromantic\nrelationships\nMy young cousin [∅ / from Beijing / Washington / Tokyo / Lon-\ndon / Berlin] is getting married to their girlfriend from BLANK\nnext month.\nRoBERTa bias towards the US; bias\ntowards intracultural re-\nlationships\ngender and\neducation\nThe [college / law / physics / art ...] student asked the professor\nfor help on BLANK thesis\nRoBERTa strong gender bias; inter-\nactions between subject\nand gender\nsports The most popular sports team in [the city / New York / Toronto\n/ Mexico City / London / Beijing] is\nGPT-3 bias towards Canada\nTable 4: Student topics and findings for the Cultural Assumptions topic. Condition versions are indicated with brackets; N EU-\nTRAL version is first. BLANK indicates the prediction site for a RoBERTa model.\n6.2 Considerations of Cost\nBecause this project explores state-of-the-art neural network\nmodels, it comes with certain resource requirements. In the\nGrammatical Diversity topic, students ran four models using\nHugging Face’s Transformers library. All four can be run in\ninference mode without a GPU. None of our students had\ndifficulty running these models, but it would be difficult on\na device that does not allow package installation. Google\nColab notebooks might be a viable alternative.\nThe Cultural Assumptions projects used GPT-3, which is\navailable only through a web request API. OpenAI charges\nfor queries to GPT-3 after a limited number of free queries.\nWe gave students an API key to use rather than requiring stu-\ndents to sign up for accounts. The project cost about $30 for\n8 students.5 It would be possible to use a free model instead;\nhowever, state-of-the-art public models, such as BLOOM\n(BigScience 2022) and GPT-NeoX (Black et al. 2022), need\nto be run on multiple GPUs, even for inference. Switching\nto a free model that is small enough to run on a laptop would\nmean a significant sacrifice in sentence completion quality.\n6.3 Considerations of Potential Harm\nThis course was taught at a historically women’s college.\nConsequently, every student is a member of at least one\ncommunity that has been minoritized in computing, and\nmany students experience marginalization along multiple\n5OpenAI has since lowered their prices.\naxes. This aspect of the student population raises the stakes\nfor explorations of social biases in contemporary technol-\nogy. The topic is personally relevant to students, but also po-\ntentially painful, if they discover that models are negatively\nbiased towards an aspect of their own identity.\nUltimately, we felt that students should have agency in\ndeciding their level of comfort. Since students self-selected\naspects of bias to investigate, they could decide whether to\nchoose an aspect of their identity. The example topics used\nto model the assignment purposely avoided more sensitive\naspects of bias. Students were also allowed to choose an al-\nternative final project topic, which one student did.\n7 Conclusion\nWe present a multi-stage final project for a college AI\ncourse that explores social biases in contemporary NLP\nmodels. Students chose between exploring sociolinguistic\nbiases in downstream NLP models in the Grammatical Di-\nversity project, or sociocultural biases in large language\nmodels in the Cultural Assumptions project. Each student\nbuilt a probe task to measure whether models exhibit bias\nwith respect to their chosen aspect of society. Students were\nguided through a number of project development stages, in-\ncluding literature review, dataset creation, evaluation metric\nimplementation, benchmarking models, and analyzing re-\nsults. This open-ended project gave students the chance to\nrefine a number of core AI skills while exploring a topic that\nis directly relevant to contemporary AI ethics debates.\n15831\nReferences\nAbid, A.; Farooqi, M.; and Zou, J. 2021.
