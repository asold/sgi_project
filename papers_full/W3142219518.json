This has triggered increasing efforts\nto visualize and analyze these “black boxes”. Be-\nsides a direct visualization of the attention weights,\nmost of the current efforts to interpret transformer\nmodels involve “probing tasks”. They are achieved\nby attaching a light-weighted auxiliary classiﬁer at\nthe output of the target transformer layer. Then\nonly the auxiliary classiﬁer is trained for well-\nknown NLP tasks like part-of-speech (POS) Tag-\nging, Named-entity recognition (NER) Tagging,\n∗ equal contribution. Correspondence to: Zeyu\nYun <chobitstian@berkeley.edu>, Yubei Chen\n<yubeic@{fb.com, berkeley.edu}>\nSyntactic Dependency, etc. Tenney et al. (2019)\nand Liu et al. (2019) show transformer models\nhave excellent performance in those probing tasks.\nThese results indicate that transformer models have\nlearned the language representation related to the\nprobing tasks. Though the probing tasks are great\ntools for interpreting language models, their lim-\nitation is explained in Rogers et al. (2020). We\nsummarize the limitation into three major points:\n• Most probing tasks, like POS and NER tag-\nging, are too simple. A model that performs\nwell in those probing tasks does not reﬂect the\nmodel’s true capacity.\n• Probing tasks can only verify whether a cer-\ntain prior structure is learned in a language\nmodel. They can not reveal the structures be-\nyond our prior knowledge.\n• It’s hard to locate where exactly the related\nlinguistic representation is learned in the trans-\nformer.\nEfforts are made to remove those limitations and\nmake probing tasks more diverse. For instance,\nHewitt and Manning (2019) proposes “structural\nprobe”, which is a much more intricate probing\ntask. Jiang et al. (2020) proposes to generate spe-\nciﬁc probing tasks automatically. Non-probing\nmethods are also explored to relieve the last two\nlimitations. For example, Reif et al. (2019) visu-\nalizes embedding from BERT using UMAP and\nshows that the embeddings of the same word un-\nder different contexts are separated into different\nclusters. Ethayarajh (2019) analyzes the similarity\nbetween embeddings of the same word in different\ncontexts. Both of these works show transformers\nprovide a context-speciﬁc representation.\nFaruqui et al. (2015); Arora et al. (2018); Zhang\net al. (2019) demonstrate how to use dictionary\nlearning to explain, improve, and visualize the un-\ncontextualized word embedding representations. In\narXiv:2103.15949v2  [cs.CL]  4 Apr 2023\nthis work, we propose to use dictionary learning\nto alleviate the limitations of the other transformer\ninterpretation techniques. Our results show that dic-\ntionary learning provides a powerful visualization\ntool, leading to some surprising new knowledge.\n2 Method\nHypothesis: contextualized word embedding as\na sparse linear superposition of transformer\nfactors. It is shown that word embedding vectors\ncan be factorized into a sparse linear combination\nof word factors (Arora et al., 2018; Zhang et al.,\n2019), which correspond to elementary semantic\nmeanings. An example is:\napple =0.09“dessert” + 0.11“organism” + 0.16\n“fruit” + 0.22“mobile&IT” + 0.42“other”.\nWe view the latent representation of words in a\ntransformer as contextualized word embedding.\nSimilarly, we hypothesize that a contextualized\nword embedding vector can also be factorized as\na sparse linear superposition of a set of elemen-\ntary elements, which we call transformer factors.\nThe exact deﬁnition will be presented later in this\nsection.\nFigure 1: Building block (layer) of transformer\nDue to the skip connections in each of the trans-\nformer blocks, we hypothesize that the representa-\ntion in any layer would be a superposition of the hi-\nerarchical representations in all of the lower layers.\nAs a result, the output of a particular transformer\nblock would be the sum of all of the modiﬁcations\nalong the way. Indeed, we verify this intuition\nwith the experiments. Based on the above observa-\ntion, we propose to learn a single dictionary for the\ncontextualized word vectors from different layers’\noutput.\nTo learn a dictionary of transformer factors\nwith non-negative sparse coding.\nGiven a set of tokenized text sequences, we col-\nlect the contextualized embedding of every word\nusing a transformer model. We deﬁne the set of\nall word embedding vectors from lth layer of trans-\nformer model as X(l). Furthermore, we collect\nthe embeddings across all layers into a single set\nX = X(1) ∪X(2) ∪···∪ X(L).\nBy our hypothesis, we assume each embedding\nvector x ∈X is a sparse linear superposition of\ntransformer factors:\nx= Φα+ ϵ, s.t.α⪰0, (1)\nwhere Φ ∈ I Rd×m is a dictionary matrix with\ncolumns Φ:,c , α∈I Rm is a sparse vector of coef-\nﬁcients to be inferred and ϵis a vector containing\nindependent Gaussian noise samples, which are as-\nsumed to be small relative to x. Typically m>d\nso that the representation is overcomplete. This\ninverse problem can be efﬁciently solved by FISTA\nalgorithm (Beck and Teboulle, 2009). The dictio-\nnary matrix Φ can be learned in an iterative fashion\nby using non-negative sparse coding, which we\nleave to the appendix section C. Each column Φ:,c\nof Φ is a transformer factorand its corresponding\nsparse coefﬁcient αc is its activation level.\nVisualization by top activation and LIME inter-\npretation. An important empirical method to visu-\nalize a feature in deep learning is to use the input\nsamples, which trigger the top activation of the fea-\nture (Zeiler and Fergus, 2014). We adopt this con-\nvention. As a starting point, we try to visualize each\nof the dimensions of a particular layer, X(l). Un-\nfortunately, the hidden dimensions of transformers\nare not semantically meaningful, which is similar\nto the uncontextualized word embeddings (Zhang\net al., 2019).\nInstead, we can try to visualize the transformer\nfactors. For a transformer factor Φ:,c and for a\nlayer-l, we denote the 1000 contextualized word\nvectors with the largest sparse coefﬁcients α(l)\nc as\nX(l)\nc ⊂ X(l), which correspond to 1000 differ-\nent sequences. For example, Figure 3 shows the\ntop 5 words that activated transformer factor-17\nΦ:,17 at layer-0, layer-2, and layer-6 respectively.\nSince a contextualized word vector is generally af-\nfected by many tokens in the sequence, we can use\nLIME (Ribeiro et al., 2016) to assign a weight to\neach token in the sequence to identify their relative\nimportance to αc. The detailed method is left to\nSection 3.\nTo determine low-, mid-, and high-level trans-\nformer factors with importance score.As we\nbuild a single dictionary for all of the transformer\nlayers, the semantic meaning of the transformer fac-\ntors has different levels. While some of the factors\nappear in lower layers and continue to be used in\nthe later stages, the rest of the factors may only be\nactivated in the higher layers of the transformer net-\nwork. A central question in representation learning\nis: “where does the network learn certain informa-\ntion?” To answer this question, we can compute\nan “importance score” for each transformer factor\nΦ:,c at layer-l as I(l)\nc . I(l)\nc is the average of the\nlargest 1000 sparse coefﬁcients α(l)\nc ’s, which cor-\nrespond to X(l)\nc . We plot the importance scores\nfor each transformer factor as a curve is shown in\nFigure 2. We then use these importance score (IS)\ncurves to identify which layer a transformer factor\nemerges. Figure 2a shows an IS curve peak in the\nearlier layer. The corresponding transformer factor\nemerges in the earlier stage, which may capture\nlower-level semantic meanings. In contrast, Fig-\nure 2b shows a peak in the higher layers, which\nindicates the transformer factor emerges much later\nand may correspond to mid- or high-level seman-\ntic structures. More subtleties are involved when\ndistinguishing between mid-level and high-level\nfactors, which will be discussed later.\nAn important characteristic is that the IS curve\nfor each transformer factor is relatively smooth.\nThis indicates if a vital feature is learned in the\nbeginning layers, it won’t disappear in later stages.\nInstead, it will be carried all the way to the end\nwith gradually decayed weight since many more\nfeatures would join along the way. Similarly, ab-\nstract information learned in higher layers is slowly\ndeveloped from the early layers. Figure 3 and 5\nconﬁrm this idea, which will be explained in the\nnext section.\n3 Experiments and Discoveries\nWe use a 12-layer pre-trained BERT model (Pre;\nDevlin et al., 2018) and freeze the weights. Since\nwe learn a single dictionary of transformer factors\nfor all of the layers in the transformer, we show that\nthese transformer factors correspond to different\nlevels of semantic or syntactic patterns. The pat-\nterns can be roughly divided into three categories:\n(a)\n (b)\nFigure 2: Importance score (IS) across all layers for\ntwo different transformer factors. (a) This ﬁgure shows\na typical IS curve of a transformer factor correspond-\ning to low-level information. (b) This ﬁgure shows a\ntypical IS curve of a transformer factor corresponds to\nmid-level information.\nword-level disambiguation, sentence-level pattern\nformation, and long-range dependency. In the fol-\nlowing, we provide detailed visualization for each\npattern category. Due to the space limit, only a\nsmall amount of the factors are demonstrated in the\npaper. To alleviate the “cherry-picking” bias, we\nalso build a website for the interested readers to\nplay with these results.\nLow-level: word-level polysemy disambigua-\ntion. While the input embedding of a token con-\ntains polysemy, we ﬁnd transformer factors with\nearly IS curve peaks usually correspond to a spe-\nciﬁc word-level meaning. By visualizing the top\nactivation sequences, we can see how word-level\ndisambiguation is gradually developed in a trans-\nformer.\nWe show how the disambiguation effect devel-\nops progressively through each layer in Figure 3.\nIn Figure 3, the top 5 activated words and their\ncontexts for transformer factor Φ:,30 in different\nlayers are listed. The top activated words in layer\n0 contain the word “left” varying senses, which is\nbeing mostly disambiguated in layer 2 albeit not\ncompletely. In layer 4, the word “left” is fully\ndisambiguated since the top-activated word con-\ntains only “left” with the word sense “leaving, exit-\ning.” We also show more examples of those types\nof transformer factors in Table 1: for each trans-\nformer factor, we list out the top 3 activated words\nand their contexts in layer 4. As shown in the table,\nnearly all top-activated words are disambiguated\ninto a single sense.\nFurther, we can quantify the quality of the disam-\nbiguation ability of the transformer model. In the\nexample above, since the top 1000 activated words\n(a) layer 0\n (b) layer 2\n (c) layer 6\nFigure 3: Visualization of a low-level transformer factor, Φ:,30 at different layers. (a), (b) and (c) are the top-\nactivated words and contexts for Φ:,30 in layer-0, 2 and 4 respectively. We can see that at layer-0, this transformer\nfactor corresponds to word vectors that encode the word “left” with different senses. In layer-2, a majority of the\ntop activated words “left” correspond to a single sense, \"leaving, exiting.\" In layer 4, all of the top-activated words\n“left” have corresponded to the same sense, \"leaving, exiting.\" Due to space limitations, we invite the readers to\nuse our website to see more of those disambiguation effects.\nTop 3 activated words and their contexts Explanation\nΦ:,2\n• that snare shot sounded like somebody’ d kicked open the door to your\nmind\".\n• i became very frustrated with that and ﬁnally made up my mind to start\ngetting back into things.\"\n•when evita asked for more time so she could make up her mind, the crowd\ndemanded,\" ¡ ahora, evita,<\n• Word “mind”\n• Noun\n• Deﬁnition: the element of a\nperson that enables them to be\naware of the world and their ex-\nperiences.\nΦ:,16\n•nington joined the ﬁve members xero and the band was renamed to linkin\npark.\n•times about his feelings about gordon, and the price family even sat away\nfrom park’ s supporters during the trial itself.\n• on 25 january 2010, the morning of park’ s 66th birthday, he was found\nhanged and unconscious in his\n• Word “park”\n• Noun\n•Deﬁnition: a common ﬁrst and\nlast name\nΦ:,30\n• saying that he has left the outsiders, kovu asks simba to let him join his\npride\n•eventually, all boycott’ s employees left, forcing him to run the estate without\nhelp.\n•the story concerned the attempts of a scientist to photograph the soul as it\nleft the body.\n• Word “left\"\n• Verb\n• Deﬁnition: leaving, exiting\nΦ:,33\n• forced to visit the sarajevo television station at night and to ﬁlm with as\nlittle light as possible to avoid the attention of snipers and bombers.\n• by the modest, cream@-@ colored attire in the airy, light@-@ ﬁlled clip.\n•the man asked her to help him carry the case to his car, a light@-@ brown\nvolkswagen beetle.\n• Word “light”\n• Noun\n• Deﬁnition: the natural agent\nthat stimulates sight and makes\nthings visible\nTable 1: Several examples of low-level transformer factors. Their top-activated words in layer 4 are marked blue,\nand the corresponding contexts are shown as examples for each transformer factor. As shown in the table, nearly\nall of the top-activated words are disambiguated into a single sense. Please note the last example of Φ:,33 is a rare\nexception, the reader may check the appendix to see a more complete list. More examples, top-activated words\nand contexts are provided in Appendix.\nand contexts are “left” with only the word sense\n“leave, exiting”, we can assume “left” when used\nas a verb, triggers higher activation in Φ:,30 than\n“left” used as other sense of speech. We can verify\nthis hypothesis using a human-annotated corpus:\nBrown corpus (Francis and Kucera, 1979). In this\ncorpus, each word is annotated with its correspond-\ning part-of-speech. We collect all the sentences\ncontains the word “left” annotated as a verb in one\nset and sentences contains “left” annotated as other\npart-of-speech. As shown in Figure 4a, in layer 0,\nthe average activation of Φ:,30 for the word “left”\nmarked as a verb is no different from “left” as other\nsenses. However, at layer 2, “left” marked as a\nverb triggers a higher activation of Φ:,30. In layer\n4, this difference further increases, indicating dis-\nambiguation develops progressively across layers.\nIn fact, we plot the activation of “left” marked as\nverb and the activation of other “left” in Figure 4b.\nIn layer 4, they are nearly linearly separable by this\n(a)\n (b)\nFigure 4: (a) Average activation ofΦ:,30 for word vector “left” across different layers. (b) Instead of averaging, we\nplot the activation of all “left” with different contexts in layer-0, 2, and 4. Random noise is added to the y-axis to\nprevent overplotting. The activation of Φ:,30 for two different word senses of “left” is blended together in layer-0.\nThey disentangle to a great extent in layer-2 and nearly separable in layer-4 by this single dimension.\n(a) layer 4\n (b) layer 6\n (c) layer 8\nFigure 5: Visualization of a mid-level transformer factor. (a), (b), (c) are the top 5 activated words and contexts\nfor this transformer factor in layer-4, 6, and 8 respectively. Again, the position of the word vector is marked blue.\nPlease notice that sometimes only a part of a word is marked blue. This is due to that BERT uses word-piece\ntokenizer instead of whole word tokenizer. This transformer factor corresponds to the pattern of “consecutive\nadjective”. As shown in the ﬁgure, this feature starts to develop at layer-4 and fully develops at layer-8.\nPrecision\n(%)\nRecall\n(%)\nF1 score\n(%)\nAverage perceptron POS\ntagger 92.7 95.5 94.1\nFinetuned BERT base\nmodel for POS task 97.5 95.2 96.3\nLogistic regression clas-\nsiﬁer with activation of\nΦ:,30 at layer 4\n97.2 95.8 96.5\nTable 2: Evaluation of binary POS tagging task: predict\nwhether or not “left” in a given context is a verb.\nsingle feature. Since each word “left” corresponds\nto an activation value, we can perform a logistic\nregression classiﬁcation to differentiate those two\ntypes of “left”. From the result shown in Figure 4a,\nit is pretty fascinating to see that the disambigua-\ntion ability of just Φ:,30 is better than the other two\nclassiﬁers trained with supervised data. This result\nconﬁrms that disambiguation is indeed done in the\nearly part of pre-trained transformer model and we\nare able to detect it via dictionary learning.\nMid level: sentence-level pattern formation.We\nﬁnd most of the transformer factors, with an IS\ncurve peak after layer 6, capture mid-level or high-\nlevel semantic meanings. In particular, the mid-\nlevel ones correspond to semantic patterns like\nphrases and sentences pattern.\nWe ﬁrst show two detailed examples of mid-level\ntransformer factors. Figure 5 shows a transformer\nfactor that detects the pattern of consecutive usage\nof adjectives. This pattern starts to emerge at layer\n4, develops at layer 6, and becomes quite reliable at\nlayer 8. Figure 6 shows a transformer factor, which\ncorresponds to a pretty unexpected pattern: “unit\nexchange”, e.g., 56 inches (140 cm). Although this\nexact pattern only starts to appear at layer 8, the\nsub-structures that make this pattern, e.g., paren-\nthesis and numbers, appear to trigger this factor in\nlayers 4 and 6. Thus this transformer factor is also\n(a) layer 4\n (b) layer 6\n (c) layer 8\nFigure 6: Another example of a mid-level transformer factor visualized at layer- 4, 6, and 8. The pattern that cor-\nresponds to this transformer factor is “unit exchange”. Such a pattern is somewhat unexpected based on linguistic\nprior knowledge.\n2 example words and their contexts with high activation Patterns L4\n(%)\nL6\n(%)\nL8\n(%)\nL10\n(%)\nΦ:,13\n• the steel pipeline was about 20 ° f(- 7 ° c) degrees.\n•hand( 56 to 64 inches( 140 to 160 cm)) war horse is that\nit was a\nUnit exchange with paren-\ntheses 0 0 64.5 95.5\nΦ:,42\n• he died at the hospice of lancaster county from heart\n• holly’ s drummer carl bunch suffered frostbite to his\ntoes( while aboard the ailments on 23 june 2007.\nSomething unfortunate\nhappened 94.0 100 100 100\nΦ:,50\n•hurricane pack 1 was a revamped version of story mode;\n• in 1998, the categories were retitled best short form\nmusic video, and best\nDoing something again,\nor making something new\nagain\n74.5 100 100 100\nΦ:,86\n•he ﬁnished the 2005 – 06 season with 21 appearances\nand seven goals.\n•of an offensive game, ﬁnishing off the 2001 – 02 season\nwith 58 points in the 47 games\nConsecutive years, used\nin foodball season nam-\ning\n0 100 85.0 95.5\nΦ:,102\n•the most prominent of which was bishop abel muzorewa’\ns united african national council\n•ralambo’ s father, andriamanelo, had established rules of\nsuccession by\nAfrican names 99.0 100 100 100\nΦ:,125\n•music writer jeff weiss of pitchfork describes the\" endur-\ning image\"\n•club reviewer erik adams wrote that the episode was a\nperfect mix\nDescribing someone in a\nparaphrasing style.

In Table 4, we construct several text\nsequences that are similar to the patterns corre-\nsponding to a particular transformer factor but with\nsubtle differences. The result conﬁrms that the con-\ntext that strictly follows the pattern represented by\nthat transformer factor triggers a high activation.\nOn the other hand, the closer the adversarial exam-\nple to this pattern, the higher activation it receives\nat this transformer factor.\nHigh-level: long-range dependency.High-level\ntransformer factors correspond to those linguistic\npatterns that span an extended range in the text.\nSince the IS curves of mid-level and high-level\ntransformer factors are similar, it is difﬁcult to dis-\ntinguish those transformer factors based on their\nIS cures. Thus, we have to manually examine the\ntop-activation words and contexts for each trans-\nformer factor to differentiate between mid-level\nand high-level transformer factors. To ease the\nprocess, we choose to use the black-box interpreta-\ntion algorithm LIME (Ribeiro et al., 2016) to iden-\ntify the contribution of each token in a sequence.\nThere also exist interpretation tools that speciﬁcally\nleverage the transformer architecture (Chefer et al.,\n2021, 2020). In the future, one could adapt those\ninterpretation tools, which may potentially provide\nbetter visualization.\nGiven a sequence s∈S, we can treat α(l)\nc,i, the\nactivation of Φ:,c in layer-lat location i, as a scalar\nfunction of s, f(l)\nc,i(s). Assume a sequence strig-\ngers a high activation α(l)\nc,i, i.e. f(l)\nc,i(s) is large. We\nwant to know how much each token (or equivalently\neach position) in s contributes to f(l)\nc,i(s). To do\nso, we generated a sequence set S(s), where each\ns′∈S(s) is the same as sexcept for that several\nrandom positions in s′are masked by [‘UNK’] (the\nunknown token). Then we learns a linear model\ngw(s′) with weights w∈RT to approximate f(s′),\nwhere T is the length of sentence s. This can be\nsolved as a ridge regression:\nmin\nw∈RT\nL(f,w, S(s)) + σ∥w∥2\n2.\nThe learned weights wcan serve as a saliency\nmap that reﬂects the “contribution” of each token\nin the sequence s. Like in Figure 7, the color re-\nﬂects the weights wat each position. Red means\nthe given position has positive weight and green\nmeans negative weight. The magnitude of weight\nis represented by the intensity. The redder a token\nis, the more it contributions to the activation of\nthe transformer factor. We leave more implementa-\ntion and mathematical formulation details of LIME\nalgorithm in the appendix.\nWe provide detailed visualization for two differ-\nent transformer factors that show long-range depen-\ndency in Figure 7, 8. Since visualization of high-\nlevel information requires more extended context,\nwe only offer the top two activated words and their\ncontexts for each such transformer factor. Many\nmore will be provided in the appendix section G.\nWe name the pattern for transformer factorΦ:,297\nin Figure 7 as “repetitive pattern detector”. All top\nactivated contexts for Φ:,297 contain an obvious\nrepetitive structure. Speciﬁcally, the text snippet\n“can’t get you out of my head\" appears twice in the\nﬁrst example, and the text snippet “xxx class pas-\nsenger, star alliance” appears three times in the sec-\nond example. Compared to the patterns we found\nin the mid-level [6], the high-level patterns like\n“repetitive pattern detector” are much more abstract.\nIn some sense, the transformer detects if there are\ntwo (or multiple) almost identical embedding vec-\ntors at layer-10 without caring what they are. Such\nbehavior might be highly related to the concept\nproposed in the capsule networks (Sabour et al.,\n2017; Hinton, 2021). To further understand this be-\nhavior and study how the self-attention mechanism\nhelps model the relationships between the features\noutlines an interesting future research direction.\nFigure 8 shown another high-level factor, which\ndetects text snippets related to “the beginning of\na biography”. The necessary components, day of\nbirth as month and four-digit years, ﬁrst name and\nlast name, familial relation, and career, are all mid-\nlevel information. In Figure 8, we see that all the\ninformation relates to biography has a high weight\nin the saliency map. Thus, they are all together\ncombined to detect the high-level pattern.\nFigure 7: Two examples of the high activated words\nand their contexts for transformer factor Φ:,297. We\nalso provide the saliency map of the tokens generated\nusing LIME. This transformer factor corresponds to the\nconcept: “repetitive pattern detector”. In other words,\nrepetitive text sequences will trigger high activation of\nΦ:,297.\nFigure 8: Visualization of Φ:,322. This transformer fac-\ntor corresponds to the concept: “some born in some\nyear” in biography. All of the high-activation contexts\ncontain the beginning of a biography. As shown in the\nﬁgure, the attributes of someone, name, age, career, and\nfamilial relation all have high saliency weights.\n4 Discussion\nDictionary learning has been successfully used to\nvisualize the classical word embeddings (Arora\net al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019). In this paper,\nwe propose to use this simple method to visual-\nize the representation learned in transformer net-\nworks to supplement the implicit “probing-tasks”\nmethods. Our results show that the learned trans-\nformer factors are relatively reliable and can even\nprovide many surprising insights into the linguis-\ntic structures. This simple tool can open up the\ntransformer networks and show the hierarchical\nsemantic or syntactic representation learned at dif-\nferent stages. In short, we ﬁnd word-level disam-\nbiguation, sentence-level pattern formation, and\nlong-range dependency. The idea of a neural net-\nwork learns low-level features in early layers, and\nabstract concepts in the later stages are very simi-\nlar to the visualization in CNN (Zeiler and Fergus,\n2014). Dictionary learning can be a convenient\ntool to help visualize a broad category of neural\nnetworks with skip connections, like ResNet (He\net al., 2016), ViT models (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020),\netc. For more interested readers, we provide an\ninteractive website1 for the readers to gain some\nfurther insights.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank our reviewers for their detailed and in-\nsightful comments.

(b) Im-\nportance score of 16 transformer factors corresponds\nto mid level information respectively.\nThe importance score curve’s characteristic has\na strong correspondence to a transformer factor’s\ncategorization. Based on the location of the peak of\nan IS curve, we can classify a transformer factor as\nlow-level, mid-level or high-level. The importance\nscore for low-level transformer factors peak in early\nlayers and slowly decrease across the rest of the\nlayers. On the other hand, the importance score\nfor mid-level and high-level transformers slowly\nincreases and peaks at higher layers. In Figure 9,\nwe show two sets of the examples to demonstrate\nthe clear distinction between those two types of IS\ncurves.\nTaking a step back, we can also plot IS curve for\neach dimension of word vector (without sparse cod-\ning) at different layers. They do not show any spe-\nciﬁc patterns, as shown in Figure 10. This makes\nintuitive sense since we mentioned that each of the\nentries of a contextualized word embedding does\nnot correspond to any clear semantic meaning.\n(a)\n (b)\nFigure 10: (a) Importance score calculated using cer-\ntain dimension of word vectors without sparse coding.\n(b) Importance score calculated using sparse coding of\nword vectors.\nB LIME: Local Interpretable\nModel-Agnostic Explanations\nAfter we trained the dictionary Φ through non-\nnegative sparse coding, the inference of the sparse\ncode of a given input is\nα(x) = arg min\nα∈R\n||x−Φα||2\n2 + λ||α||1\nFor a given sentence and index pair(s,i), the em-\nbedding of word w= s[i] by layer lof transformer\nis x(l)(x,i). Then we can abstract the inference of\na speciﬁc entry of sparse code of the word vector\nas a black-box scalar-value function f:\nf((s,i)) = α(x(l)(s,i))\nLet RandomMask denotes the operation that\ngenerates perturbed version of our sentence sby\nmasking word at random location with “[UNK]”\n(unkown) tokens. For example, a masked sentence\ncould be\n[Today is a [‘UNK’],day]\nLet hdenote a encoder for perturbed sentences\ncompared to the unperturbed sentence s, such that\nh(s)t =\n{ 0 if s[t] = [‘UNK’]\n1 Otherwis\nThe LIME algorithm we used to generated\nsaliency map for each sentences is the following:\nAlgorithm 1Explaining Sparse Coding Activation\nusing LIME Algorithm\n1: S= {h(s)}\n2: Y = {f(s)}\n3: for each iin {1,2,...,N } do\n4: s′\ni ←RandomMask(s)\n5: S←S∪ h(s′\ni)\n6: Y ←Y ∪f(s′\ni)\n7: end for\n8: w←Ridgew(S,Y )\nWhere Ridgew is a weighted ridge regression\ndeﬁned as:\nw= arg min\nw∈Rt\n||SΩw−Y||2 + λ||w||2\n2\nΩ = diag(d(h(S1),⃗1),d(h(S2),⃗1),··· ,d(h(Sn),⃗1))\nd(·,·) can be any metric that measures how much\na perturbed sentence is different from the original\nsentence. If a sentence is perturbed such that every\ntoken is being masked, then the distanceh(h(s′),⃗1)\nshould be 0, if a sentence is not perturbed at all,\nthen h(h(s′),⃗1) should be 1. We choose d(·,·) to\nbe cosine similarity in our implementation.\nIn practice, we also uses feature selection. This\nis done by running LIME twice. After we obtain\nthe regression weight w1 for the time, we use it to\nﬁnd the ﬁrst kindices corresponds to the entry in\nw1 with highest absolute value. We use those k\nindex as location in the sentence and apply LIME\nfor the second time with only those selected indices\nfrom step 1.\nOverall, the regression weightwcan be regarded\nas a saliency map. The higher the weight wk is, the\nmore important the word s[k] in the sentence since\nit contributes more to the activation of a speciﬁc\ntransformer factor.\nWe could also have negative weight in w. In\ngeneral, negative weights are hard to interpret in the\ncontext of transformer factor. The activation will\nincrease if they are removed those word correspond\nto negative weights. Since a transformer factor\ncorresponds to a speciﬁc pattern, then word with\nnegative weights are those word in a context that\nbehaves “opposite\" of this pattern.\nC The Details of the Non-negative Sparse\nCoding Optimization\nLet Sbe the set of all sequences, recall how we de-\nﬁned word embedding using hidden state of trans-\nformer in the main section: X(l) = {x(l)(s,i)|s∈\nS,i ∈[0,len(s)]}as the set of all word embedding\nat layer l, then the set of word embedding across\nall layers is deﬁned as\nX = X(1) ∪X(2) ∪···∪ X(L)\nIn practice, we use BERT base model as our trans-\nformer model, each word embedding vector (hid-\nden state of BERT) is dimension 768. To learn the\ntransformer factors, we concatenate all word vector\nx∈X into a data matrix A. We also deﬁned f(x)\nto be the frequency of the token that is embedded\nin word vector x. For example, if xis the embed-\nding of the word “the”, it will have a much larger\nfrequency i.e. f(x) is high.\nUsing f(x), we deﬁne the Inverse Frequency\nMatrix Ω: Ω is a diagonal matrix where each entry\non the diagonal is the square inverse frequency of\neach word, i.e.\nΩ = diag( 1√\nf(x1)\n, 1√\nf(x2)\n,...)\nThen we use a typical iterative optimization pro-\ncedure to learn the dictionary Φ described in the\nmain section:\nmin\nA\n1\n2 ∥X−ΦA∥2\nF+λ\n∑\ni\n∥αi∥1, s.t. αi ⪰0, (2)\nmin\nΦ\n1\n2 ∥X−ΦΩA∥2\nF, ∥Φ:,j∥2 ≤1. (3)\nThese two optimizations are both convex, we\nsolve them iteratively to learn the transformer fac-\ntors: In practice, we use minibatches contains 200\nword vectors as X. The motivation of apply In-\nverse Frequency Matrix Ω is that we want to make\nsure all words in our vocabulary has the same con-\ntribution. When we sample our minibatch from A,\nfrequent words like “the” and “a” are much likely\nto appear, which should receive lower weight dur-\ning update.\nOptimization 2 can converge in 1000 steps using\nthe FISTA algorithm2. We experimented with dif-\nferent λvalues from 0.03 to 3, and chooseλ= 0.27\nto give results presented in this paper. Once the\nsparse coefﬁcients have been inferred, we update\nour dictionary Φ based on Optimization 3 by one\nstep using an approximate second-order method,\nwhere the Hessian is approximated by its diagonal\nto achieve an efﬁcient inverse (Duchi et al., 2011).\nThe second-order parameter update method usually\nleads to much faster convergence. Empirically, we\ntrain 200k steps and it takes roughly 2 days on a\nNvidia 1080 Ti GPU.\nD Hyperlinks for More Transformer\nVisualization\nIn the following three sections, we provide visu-\nalization of more example transformer factor in\nlow-level, mid-level, and high-level.
