    "abstract": "Ship target identification is of great significance in both military and civilian fields. Many methods have been proposed to identify the targets using tracks information. However, most of existing studies can only identify two or three types of targets, and the accuracy of identification needs to be further improved. Meanwhile, they do not provide a reliable probability of the identification result under a high-noise environment. To address these issues, a Bayesian-Transformer Neural Network (BTNN) is proposed to complete the ship target identification task using tracks information. The aim of the research is improving the ability of ship target identification to enhance the maritime situation awareness and strengthen the protection of maritime traffic safety. Firstly, a Bayesian-Transformer Encoder (BTE) module that contains four different Bayesian-Transformer Encoders is used to extract discriminate features of tracks. Then, a Bayesian fully connected layer and a SoftMax layer complete the classification. Benefiting from the superiority of the Bayesian neural network, BTNN can provide a reliable probability of the result, which captures both aleatoric uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty. The experiments show that the proposed method can successfully identify nine types of ship targets. Compared with traditional methods, the identification accuracy of BTNN increases by 3.8% from 90.16%. In addition, compared with non-Bayesian Transformer Neural Network, the BTNN can provide a more reliable probability of the identification result under a high-noise environment.",
