  "abstract": "The rapid adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) systems has made clinical data available in electronic format for research and for many downstream applications. Electronic screening of potentially eligible patients using these clinical databases for clinical trials is a critical need to improve trial recruitment efficiency. Nevertheless, manually translating free-text eligibility criteria into database queries is labor intensive and inefficient. To facilitate automated screening, free-text eligibility criteria must be structured and coded into a computable format using controlled vocabularies. Named entity recognition (NER) is thus an important first step. In this study, we evaluate 4 state-of-the-art transformer-based NER models on two publicly available annotated corpora of eligibility criteria released by Columbia University (i.e., the Chia data) and Facebook Research (i.e.the FRD data). Four transformer-based models (i.e., BERT, ALBERT, RoBERTa, and ELECTRA) pretrained with general English domain corpora vs. those pretrained with PubMed citations, clinical notes from the MIMIC-III dataset and eligibility criteria extracted from all the clinical trials on ClinicalTrials.gov were compared. Experimental results show that RoBERTa pretrained with MIMIC-III clinical notes and eligibility criteria yielded the highest strict and relaxed F-scores in both the Chia data (i.e., 0.658/0.798) and the FRD data (i.e., 0.785/0.916). With promising NER results, further investigations on building a reliable natural language processing (NLP)-assisted pipeline for automated electronic screening are needed.",
