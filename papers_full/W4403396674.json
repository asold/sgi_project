    "abstract": "Governments are facing the benefits and perils of recent developments in artificial intelligence. One key objective is using AI to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of their public service provision. While academic research has examined these advances, there is a lack of empirical evidence regarding user experiences. This paper explores the initial results of using a chatbot based on a Large Language Model (LLM) to address user queries about the Management and Performance Program (PGD). Survey analysis demonstrated that ChatPGD is likely to reduce program-related response time and increase effectiveness. However, the initial tests indicated a need to refine response algorithms to detect and mitigate potential biases and to strengthen the system infrastructure to support new enhancements. This paper examines the chatbot's application in harnessing government databases, highlighting the potential benefits, challenges, and perspectives of embedding AI and LLMs in public service delivery. The insights can support the development of other public service LLMs.",
