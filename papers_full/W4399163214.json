    "abstract": "Abstract This action research study focuses on the integration of “AI assistants” in two Agile software development meetings: the Daily Scrum and a feature refinement, a planning meeting that is part of an in-house Scaled Agile framework. We discuss the critical drivers of success, and establish a link between the use of AI and team collaboration dynamics. We conclude with a list of lessons learnt during the interventions in an industrial context, and provide a assessment checklist for companies and teams to reflect on their readiness level. This paper is thus a road-map to facilitate the integration of AI tools in Agile setups.",
