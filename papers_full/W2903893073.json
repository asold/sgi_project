Systems Thinking in Practice\nINTRODUCTION\nThe emergence of One Health (OH) and EcoHealth (EH)\napproaches over the past decade, recently complemented by\nthe Planetary Health (PH) movement (\n1), illustrates the\nconsolidation of a consensus in the veterinary and public-he alth\ndomains that there is a need for integrated, interdisciplina ry\nand inter-sectoral approaches to better understand health is sues,\nand to improve the sustainability and relevance of intervent ions\ntargeting individual and population health in various social ,\ncultural and environmental contexts. The recent publishing of\nthe One Health theme issue in the Philosophical Transactions\nof the Royal Society B (\n2) and the present issue embody\nthis consensus and highlight the need for a clariﬁcation of\nthe principles underlying these integrated approaches to healt h\n(IAH) (\n3, 4), the key methods and tools they rely on to collect\ndata, monitor processes and outcomes, and their eﬀectiveness\nand relevance for coping with veterinary and public health iss ues.\nThe Ecosystem approach, underpinning Ecohealth (and in\nprinciple One Health) (Wilcox et al., under review in this\nResearch Topic), has been developed over the last two decades\n(\n4–6) to address pressing social-ecological challenges. Howeve r,\nit remains sparsely used when it comes to public health related\ninterventions (Wilcox et al., under review in this Research\nTopic). Building on the conceptual foundation of the ecosyste m\napproach (\n6), we propose that IAH initiatives, whatever their\ndominant epistemological orientation (e.g., One Health and\nveterinary sciences, Ecohealth and disease ecology, etc.) , should\nroutinely take a comprehensive view of the complex interaction s\nbetween human and natural systems at multiple scales and leve ls\n(\n7). This would require taking a participatory approach to more\nwidely involve key stakeholders in:\n1. deﬁnition and description of relevant social-ecological\nsystems in terms of scale, extent, structure and functionin g;\n2. assessment of their state in terms of health, as deﬁned by w hat\nis acceptable to society;\n3. assessment of threats;\n4. maintenance, mitigation, and rehabilitation, and;\n5. using adaptive management strategies to ensure longer ter m\nsystems resilience (\n8).\nWe also argue for more attention within these participatory\napproaches to the use of modeling techniques which encourage\nthose involved to clarify what key variables aﬀect the underl ying\nsystem(s), the factors that will shape responses, uncertaint ies\ninvolved, and the likely outcomes of particular strategies (\n9).\nSuch integrated approaches (to health and other areas)\nrecognize that animals, humans and the environment are\ninterdependent, and the complex interactions between these\ncomponents not only challenges simplistic views of ecosystem\nfunctioning (\n10), but should change the way we manage them,\nmoving from the imposition of technocratic solutions target ed at\nsubsets of the system; to working directly with stakeholder s in\nthe decision process, and acknowledging local social-ecolo gical\nknowledge in practice ( 6, 11). This is, in eﬀect, social learning\nas a participatory process of social change in which people learn\nfrom each other in ways that can beneﬁt wider social-ecologi cal\nsystems (\n12), and in which modeling serves as a key tool, both\nfor this learning to happen and for supporting decision-making\nprocesses (\n13, 14).\nZinsstag et al. ( 3) argue that individual and population\nhealth can be seen as emerging properties of a system’s\ninteracting social and ecological factors. It follows that any\nIAH attempting to sustainably improve public-health and\npopulation well-being needs to help key stakeholders understa nd\nand adaptively manage social-ecological dynamics. We note\ntwo major impediments to the success of IAH projects in\nthis regard. Firstly, there is insuﬃcient representation and\nintegration of social sciences and disciplines related to ec ological\nthinking and environmental management (\n15–18). Secondly,\nmore participatory and integrated modeling is needed to help\nsystematically capture and integrate our understanding of h ow\nchanges in management, climate, demographics, and other\nfactors aﬀect selected indicators of system health (\n19). The\nfact that these ﬁelds are underrepresented in IAH reﬂects\nthe human and veterinary health sector foci on disease when\naddressing health issues. Disease management is not the same as\npromoting health, which requires a more salutogenic orienta tion\n(\n20, 21) grounded in resilience theory and practice, medical\nsociology and anthropology and participatory action-research .\nThis orientation more closely ﬁts what arguably should be\nOne Health’s primary concern to maintain the integrity of\nthe human-animal-environment complexes in face of stressor s.\nThis orientation is also better aligned with the United Natio ns\nSustainable Development Goals, which involve a more diverse\nrange of expertise as well as methodologies for their integrat ion\n(Wilcox et al., under review in this Research Topic).\nIn this perspective article, we highlight the importance of\nunderpinning IAH approaches with three key practice areas:\n(1) systems thinking—to help a wider range of stakeholders\ndevelop a shared agreement around problem structuring; (2)\nmodeling—to help people understand trends and see processes\nunfold that are either too big or too little to appreciate with\nthe naked eye; and (3) facilitation—to support the constructive\nparticipation of key stakeholders in the wider decision-makin g\nprocess. We also reinforce the importance of linking across th ese\nthree practice areas. We begin by discussing the converging\nattributes and underlying characteristics of OH, EH, and PH\n(all designated by “IAH”) [see also Lerner and Berg (\n22) for a\ncomplementary discussion] and brieﬂy clarify system thinking\norigins and epistemology. Finally, we highlight a rationale for\nthe design of more integrated and adaptive methodologies for\neﬀective implementation dealing with complexity in practice.\nTHE UNDERLYING CHARACTERISTICS OF\nIAH\nComplexity\nIAH recognizes that complexity is an inherent characteristic of\nnatural systems (\n10, 11). Since the mid 1980s, starting with the\npioneers of the Santa Fe Institute in the United States, complex\nsystems became a ﬁeld of investigation. Deﬁnitions of system s\nproperties that are commonly associated with complexity, such\nFrontiers in Veterinary Science | www.frontiersin.org 2 December 2018 | Volume 5 | Article 303\nDuboz et al. Systems Thinking in Practice\nas chaos, scales, emergence, bifurcation, auto-organizat ion,\nadaptation, and resilience can be found in the complex systems\nliterature. Here, we focus on some features of this ﬁeld that h ave\ndirect implications for IAH.\nWhile complexity and how to address it is still debated,\nthe synthesis by Deﬀuant et al. (\n23) oﬀers a good overview of\nthe origins, uses and operational implications of complexity–\nbased practices and oﬀers a roadmap for more integrative\nimplementation ( Table 1). The authors distinguish three main\nepistemological views pointing to the importance of clearly\nunderstanding and explicitly acknowledging which view(s) a re\nbeing considered, and perhaps integrated, when dealing with\ncomplexity on a project-basis. These viewpoints inﬂuence the\nkinds of questions we raise and the methods we develop to\naddress them ( Table 1).\nThe three views of complexity have diﬀerent implications\nrelated to how the principles and methodological attributes\nare implemented in the context of IAH. View 1 acknowledges\nthat the predictive power of models 1 is often intrinsically\nlimited because of the sensitivity to initial conditions, t hat\nuncertainty and surprise must be taken into account, and\nthat emerging properties should be identiﬁed—and so far\nas possible understood. From view 2, it is understood\nthat heterogeneous available knowledge and data can be\nintegrated into simulation models used to explore scenario-\nbased projections. Complementarily, view 3 recommends the\nuse of participatory processes to build iterative and adaptive\nmanagement strategies in which resilience thinking and the active\nengagement of stakeholders to insure relevant representati on\nof worldviews and perceptions, attributes that are inherently\nsubjective, are essential ingredients.\nParticipation and Transdisciplinarity\nWhen implementing IAH, the ultimate goal is to improve health\nof humans, animals and ecosystems conjointly. This stateme nt\nis highly subjective, and the third vision of complexity tells us\nthat to achieve such a goal, participation (active involvemen t and\nengagement of aﬀected interests and stakeholders in framing the\nproblem and the discovery of adaptive responses to meet IAH\nobjectives) is key. Attention should be paid to the participati on\nlabel. It hides a substantial diversity of inclusion criter ia and\npractices (\n24, 25). In participatory research, the diversity in\nimplementing and designing participatory processes relies on t he\nnecessity to adapt to local contexts and the classical questi ons\nregarding who to involve, how and where, and for whose beneﬁt\n(\n26, 27). The point here is to acknowledge that representatives\nof civil society, and decision makers at all relevant levels ,\nmust be involved in IAH, including in research design and\nimplementation. Accordingly, the mobilized knowledge is no t\nonly scientiﬁc and expert, but also practical and local (\n28, 29).\nConsequently, power relations (who knows, decides and acts)\nare decentralized, shared between heterogeneous actors, a nd\nmade dynamic throughout the participatory process (\n24, 30).\nWinter [( 31), p7] contends that “ policy [substituted here as\nIAH] brings to statement what is judged to be possible, desirable\n1A “model” is a representation of reality (e.g., diagram, map, mathematics, game).\nand meaningful. . . and is the nexus of facts, value and ultimat e\nmeaning in which scientiﬁc, ethical and theological-philo sophical\nreﬂections meet. ” Embracing the complexity of a situation with\nits heterogeneous set of actors, accounting for the diversi ty of\ntheir perspectives, perceptions and values, creating knowledg e\noriented toward solutions and transferable to both scienti ﬁc and\nsocietal practice, is fundamental to transdisciplinary rese arch\n(32–36). IAH practice should also encourage researchers to\nactively include a process of reﬂection about the transdiscipl inary\nprocess itself ( 25). Allen et al. ( 37) and Seidl ( 38) contend that\nthe majority of researchers in the “hard” sciences are unfam iliar\nwith such a reﬂexive approach and may consider it a challenge to\nexisting power relationships, but it is essential to the progre ss of\nthe ﬁeld.\nTransdisciplinary research bridges science and practice (\n39,\n40) and fosters the emergence of social learning and collectiv e\nintelligence via participation. Boulding ( 41) argues that eﬀective\napplications of general systems theory (and by extension\ntransdisciplinary research and participatory modeling) cata lyzes\nand coheres a “Republic of Learning” comprised of all aﬀected\ninterests and disciplines.\nThe extent to which the historical, cultural, environmenta l,\nsociological, and economical contexts are integrated depend s\non the deﬁnition of the problem and the formation of an\ninterdisciplinary, cross-sectoral team that will deﬁne it. Lerner\nand Berg (\n22) argue the deﬁnition of boundaries when adopting\nan integrated approach is an important step. The same can be\nsaid regarding the choices in the levels of organization, an d the\ntime and space scales, i.e., the characteristic physical dimen sions\nof the phenomenon under consideration (\n7). Therefore, the set\nof disciplines, and more generally the set of knowledge, we\nhave to mobilize to deal with a speciﬁc IAH problem cannot be\nentirely deﬁned a priori by a particular integrative framework.\nRather it should be negotiated and incrementally agreed. Do ing\notherwise would freeze the deﬁnition of the problem and the se t\nof perspectives to be involved in addressing it, limiting the s et\nof possible responses and decisions. Therefore, the participatory\nprocess must be iterative and adaptive, focusing on clear and\ncontextualized objectives. The participatory process enhanc es co-\nlearning, evolves, and should strive to manage any conﬂict a nd\npower strategies (\n24, 26, 30). As much as possible, we must aim\nto create “safe forums for articulating and debating issues where\nfacts are uncertain, values in dispute, stakes high and decisio ns\nurgent” (41–43).\nFrom these considerations, a practical methodology for IAH\nshould consider the three views of complexity, and should be\niterative, adaptive, and participative (\n6).\nSYSTEMS THINKING AS A FOUNDATION\nSystems Theory and Modeling\nSystems theory has a long history.

Forrester who\ninitiated the modern vision of the ﬁeld of system dynamics.\nForrester was a pioneer in applying systems engineering and\ncomputer simulations to analyze social systems and predict th eir\nbehavior (\n49). Since, systems theory has spread and developed\nin diﬀerent ﬁelds, such as business, management ( 50, 51) and\necology ( 52). We invite the reader to search the literature,\ne.g., Luhmann’s 2012 book Introduction to systems theory (53),\nto grasp the depth of the ﬁeld and explore its foundational\ndevelopments. Systems theory provides a common language\nto deal with reality, necessary for collaborators to unders tand\neach other in interdisciplinary research. Von Bertalanﬀy use d\nmathematics derived from the ﬁeld of dynamical systems\nto describe systems and predict their behavior. The ﬁeld of\ndynamical systems inherits insights from a long tradition i n\nmathematics and physics in its methods and principles, which\nstill widely support current modeling and simulation in biolog y,\necology, and epidemiology. Dynamical systems applications\nprovide a fundamental theoretical framework IAH can beneﬁt\nfrom, including, for example, perspectives derived from chaos\ntheory or resilience theory (\n54). Theory of modeling and\nsimulation ( 55) can be viewed as a foundation for more recent\nmodel variants developed in ecology, epidemiology and coupled\nsocial and ecological modeling, such as agent- or individua l-\nbased models (\n56–58). This has important implications for\nIAH development, which can beneﬁt from the conceptual and\nmethodological advances in these mathematical ﬁelds. Altho ugh\nmodeling has been highlighted recently for its potential to d eal\nwith IAH complexity (\n59, 60), its use in the context of IAH\nresearch and intervention remains minimal. We emphasize her e\nthat modeling is a process of applying systems theory.\nSystems Thinking\nThe term “systems thinking” has developed as an approach to\nreal-world problem solving through the Operational Research\nﬁeld (\n41, 61–63). P. M. Senge developed the concept in the\nﬁeld of organizational theory and management. He identiﬁed\nthe problems brought by fragmented knowledge and the lack\nof holistic learning in organizations (\n50). Ross and Wade\n(64) presented systems thinking as a set of skills used to\nimprove the capability of identifying and understanding syst ems,\npredicting their behaviors, and planning change to produce\ndesired eﬀects. Systems thinking is a practice based on system s\ntheory. It addresses concrete problems where the complexity o f\nthe system constrains understanding and explanation due to pr e-\nconceptions and the limitations of cognitive processing. Figure 1\ngives a synoptic view of systems thinking.\nRoss and Wade (\n64) summarize the following sequence of\ntasks when applying systems thinking:\n• Identify and understand the system structures considering\ndiﬀerent scales and levels.\n– Deﬁnition of the system boundaries, its closeness or\nopenness, the scales considered in time and space, the\norganization level (cells, individuals, societies, ecosys tems,\netc.), the set of components and the connectivity between\nthem.\n• Identify and understand the system dynamics at diﬀerent\nscales.\n– Description of the ﬂows of matter, energy and information\nbetween the components, the synergies and the context-\ndependent changes in system structure.\n• Reliably infer the impact of change to the system.\nTo these points we add elements of social context when applying\nsystems thinking:\n• Incorporate multiple perspectives and worldviews.\n• Consider the environmental, cultural, religious, economic , and\npolitical contexts.\n• Consider power relationships.\nWhile these tasks are often used to describe modeling and\nsimulation activities, they are increasingly used as a frame work\nfor complex participatory problem solving. Modeling activities\nare deﬁned broadly and include a wide range of tools and\nmethodologies (\n66). These include mind maps, charts, diagrams,\nFrontiers in Veterinary Science | www.frontiersin.org 4 December 2018 | Volume 5 | Article 303\nDuboz et al. Systems Thinking in Practice\nFIGURE 1 |Systems thinking—Adapted from ( 65).\nor equations, while simulation ranges from computation usin g\na computer to role playing games involving human actors.\nThese existing tools support practitioners to apply modeling and\nsimulation to implement systems thinking.\nThe knowledge we have about the context, the structure and\nthe dynamics of a system constrains the decisions we make on\nits management, and consequently the potential for sustaina ble\nhealth development. When implementing IAH, knowledge is\ndistributed and exchanged between diﬀerent actors. Therefo re,\ntheir participation and smooth communication is necessary if\nwe want to integrate the contexts and the diﬀerent perspectives\ninto the iterative process of identifying problem and solutio ns\n(\n67). Modeling and simulation should therefore be participative\nand integrated research teams should also include social sc ience\nexpertise in engagement and facilitation for designing, man aging\nand evaluating the participatory process ( 27, 68).\nParticipatory Modeling and Co-learning\nFrom the above, we argue that IAH should be iterative,\nadaptive and participatory to deal with complexity. Participator y\nmodeling demonstrates how these requirements can be met\nin practice. It mobilizes the implicit and explicit knowledge\nof diﬀerent actors to build a shared representation of reality\n(\n67, 69–72). Participatory modeling is a transdisciplinary process\nthat facilitates knowledge sharing and the generation of ne w\nknowledge to support negotiation and planning. As such, it\nsupports decision-making and adaptive management (\n73). The\nmodel is not presented as a singular deﬁnitive solution or ﬁna l\nproduct but an intermediary pedagogical device used to foster\ndialogue (\n74). Numerous participatory modeling methods exist,\nall derived from the ﬁeld of collaborative learning which appea red\nin the late 1960s ( 75). Co-learning is an approach that promotes\nmultiple forums where diverse participants can work together o n\nconcrete problems or to create a product ( 76, 77). Discussions\nare not just about technical solutions, but also center on iss ues\nof ethics and power ( 31, 68). When coupled with participatory\nsimulation (scenario analysis), this approach generates coll ective\ninnovations.\nGroup Model Building (GMB), initiated in the ﬁeld of system\ndynamics in the 1980s ( 67, 78, 79), was the ﬁrst participatory\nmodeling methodology studying stakeholder involvement and\nits eﬀects on model production and decision-making, and\nfostering ideas into concrete actions. GMB was ﬁrst applied\nin the business ﬁeld, and environmental modelers adopted\nit in more diverse, cross-sectoral and ill-deﬁned contexts\ncharacterizing environmental challenges (\n75). Methodologies,\nsuch as Community-Based System Dynamics modeling (CBSD)\ndeveloped in 2009 by P. Hovmand (\n80), and Mediated Modeling\n(MM) founded in the 2000s by M. van den Belt ( 81) are closely\nrelated to the GMB approach. MM involves a series of workshops\nproceeding through stages of problem deﬁnition, conceptual\nmodel of the system (in which scientists may help to quantify\nﬂows and gather data), then participants “test” the model\nthrough scenarios. A strength within the mediated modeling\nFrontiers in Veterinary Science | www.frontiersin.org 5 December 2018 | Volume 5 | Article 303\nDuboz et al. Systems Thinking in Practice\napproach developed by Thompson et al. ( 27) is that facilitators\ncreated a novel operating context for the modelers, using\nparticipatory techniques, such as historical and cultural ti melines\nto elicit participant knowledge about changes in the complex\nsystem under study. Whereas CBSD focuses on advancing\nsocial innovation and capacity building, MM promotes more\nthe creation of a shared understanding. These methodologie s\nare mainly associated with systems thinking and facilitatio n,\nbut ﬁt very well with the development of system dynamics\nmodels.\nSpatial group model building (\n28, 82) incorporates a\nspatial basis to participatory modeling, which can either\nbe computer-assisted (\n28), or use manual methods, such\nas transparent map overlays ( 82) depending on the\nnature of the participants and availability of technology\nin the study context. Maps help participants visualize the\ncontext of the complex system, elicit more contextualized\ninformation (\n28), locate components of the complex\nsystem, and allow tracing of movements, such as supply\nchains (\n82).\nAnother participatory modeling approach that appeared in\nthe 1990s, the Companion Modeling (ComMod) ( 72), shares\nmany characteristics with the methodologies cited above. I t\nuses multi-agents systems and role playing games to conduct\nparticipatory simulation sessions. ComMod systematically\nconsiders power relationships among stakeholders within\na social context. It was characterized in a review paper by\nSeidl as a “genuine participatory approach” [(\n38), p. 575],\nComMod is deeply adaptive; the model evolves as the problems\nchange during the research and implementation period. Even\nthe modeling tools can be diﬀerent all along the process.\nTherefore, ComMod qualiﬁes itself more as a research\nposture than a methodology attached to a particular set of\ntools.\nOn the basis of these diﬀerent methodologies and others,\na generic framework of participatory model development has\nbeen proposed (\n83). Binot et al. ( 59) and Duboz and Binot\n(84) contend that participatory modeling approaches are ideal to\naccompany adaptive management as well as to foster engagement\nand sharing of responsibilities. They should be used to implem ent\nIAH. However, Allen et al. (\n68) remind us that existing\nparticipatory initiatives in integrated science are better s een\nas islands of success, rather than evidence of a new sweeping\nparadigm.\nIn proposing participatory modeling as a potential\npathway for improved systems approaches that can deal\nwith the complexity of IAH we do not wish to under-\nstate the potential shift in ethos and practice required.\nParticipatory modeling itself needs to reside within an over all\nsystems problem-solving framework. This calls for greater\nappreciation of the social processes of building collective\nsystems knowledge, understanding choices and designing an d\nmonitoring interventions for change. This correspondingly\ncalls for a wider remit for social process specialists in IAH\ninitiatives (\n27) and, we would argue, an acknowledgment\nof the limitations of modeling approaches without this\npartnership.\nCONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we highlight systems thinking as a necessary\nfoundation for IAH. We do so by discussing the origins\nand epistemology of systems thinking, revealing its strong\nmathematical roots and arguing that modeling informed by bo th\ndynamical system theory and social participatory innovation s\ncan help ground IAH theoretically and advance the tools\nnecessary to deal with complexity in practice. Mathematical o r\ncomputational models, for instance, within the ﬁrst and secon d\nviews of complexity (see Table 1) help identify and understand\nglobal system properties, such as feedback loops, controls,\nviability, resilience and emergence, elements of complexit y that\nare usually ignored mostly because of the lack of tools to\nassess them. Combining mathematical models with innovativ e\nparticipatory approaches that encourage co-learning helps ensu re\nthat modeling is context-sensitive (i.e., culturally and soc ially\nrelevant), iterative and adaptive. These approaches also enabl e\na normative focus to ensure issues around ethics, equity, an d\npower are included in the decision-making process. The idea\nof a negotiated complexity (\n85) for decision support systems\nsimilarly supports more inclusion of social sciences in embrac ing\ncomplexity. We argue that participatory modeling should be a\nkey component of any IAH initiative, as it enables the practica l\noperationalization of an otherwise elusive holistic eﬀort.\nTo take a consistent and comprehensive approach, funding\nschemes supporting IAH would follow the same iterative and\nadaptive principles. It follows that funding agencies need to\nbe included in the design and development of IAH research\nand adaptive management strategies. Furthermore, and despit e\nthe critical role played by participatory innovations that are\ninherently grounded in social sciences theory and practice, m any\nkey social science disciplines remain under-represented in m ost\ncurrent IAH. Including social research expertise to manage\nappropriate participation, social engagement and facilitation is\nessential to address the ethical dimensions of systems, iden tify\npower relations, equity and gender issues, and therefore are\nkeys to adapt the modeling process to the social and cultural\ncontext.\nAccordingly, we argue that systems thinking and its attribu tes\nshould be part of veterinary health and public health curricul a\n(it is already well-accepted in ecology, the other dimension\nin One Health and EcoHealth). To achieve this, theory and\nmethods taught in systems engineering and ecology can be\nadapted to the particular issues addressed by these domains.\nThis instruction also needs to go further and provide student s\nsome expertise and familiarity in working comfortably in\ninter- and trans-disciplinary teams that also include system\nthinking specialists that can bring complementary skills in\nsystem dynamics modeling and in facilitation and problem\nstructuring.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nRD and PE are the main contributors.
