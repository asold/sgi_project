  "full_text": "Adapting Language Models for Zero-shot Learning by Meta-tuning on\nDataset and Prompt Collections\nRuiqi Zhong Kristy Lee ∗ Zheng Zhang∗ Dan Klein\nComputer Science Division, University of California, Berkeley\n{ruiqi-zhong, kristylee, zhengzhang1216, klein}@berkeley.edu\nAbstract\nLarge pre-trained language models (LMs)\nsuch as GPT-3 have acquired a surprising abil-\nity to perform zero-shot learning. For exam-\nple, to classify sentiment without any train-\ning examples, we can “prompt\" the LM with\nthe review and the label description “ Does\nthe user like this movie? \", and ask whether\nthe next word is “ Yes\" or “ No\". However,\nthe next word prediction training objective\nis still misaligned with the target zero-shot\nlearning objective. To address this weakness,\nwe propose meta-tuning, which directly opti-\nmizes the zero-shot learning objective by ﬁne-\ntuning pre-trained language models on a col-\nlection of datasets. We focus on classiﬁcation\ntasks, and construct the meta-dataset by ag-\ngregating 43 existing datasets and annotating\n441 label descriptions in a question-answering\n(QA) format. When evaluated on unseen\ntasks, meta-tuned models outperform a same-\nsized QA model and the previous SOTA zero-\nshot learning system based on natural lan-\nguage inference. Additionally, increasing pa-\nrameter count from 220M to 770M improves\nAUC-ROC scores by 6.3%, and we forecast\nthat even larger models would perform bet-\nter. Therefore, measuring zero-shot learning\nperformance on language models out-of-the-\nbox might underestimate their true potential,\nand community-wide efforts on aggregating\ndatasets and unifying their formats can help\nbuild models that answer prompts better.\n1 Introduction\nThe goal of zero-shot classiﬁcation (ZSC) is to\nclassify textual inputs using label descriptions\nwithout any examples (Yin et al., 2019). Large\nlanguage models - whose only training objective\nis to predict the next word given the context - have\nacquired a surprising ability to perform ZSC (Rad-\nford et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020; Le Scao and\nRush, 2021). For example, to classify whether the\nsentence “This movie is amazing!\" is positive, we\ncan prompt the language model with the context\n“Review: This movie is amazing! Positive Re-\nview? ___ \", and check whether the next word\nis more likely to be “ Yes\" or “ No\" (Zhao et al.,\n2021). To convert ZSC into a language modeling\n(LM) task that an LM model is likely to perform\nwell, many recent works focus on ﬁnding better\nprompts (Shin et al., 2020; Schick and Schütze,\n2020a,b; Gao et al., 2021).\nHowever, the LM training objective is corre-\nlated but still misaligned with the target objective\nto answer prompts. Our work addresses this weak-\nness by directly optimizing the zero-shot classi-\nﬁcation objective through ﬁne-tuning (Section 4).\nThis requires us to 1) unify different classiﬁcation\ntasks into the same format, and 2) gather a col-\nlection of classiﬁcation datasets and label descrip-\ntions (prompts) for training (Section 2). Since we\nﬁne-tune our model on a meta-dataset, we name\nour approach meta-tuning.\nWe focus on binary classiﬁcation tasks and\nunify them into a “ Yes\"/“No\" QA format (Clark\net al., 2019; McCann et al., 2018), where the input\nis provided as the context and the label informa-\ntion is provided in the question (Figure 1 (a)). Us-\ning this format, we gathered a diverse set of clas-\nsiﬁcation datasets from 43 different sources listed\non Kaggle, SemEval, HuggingFace, and other pa-\npers. These tasks range from hate speech detec-\ntion, question categorization, sentiment classiﬁ-\ncation to stance classiﬁcation, etc, and the genre\nranges from textbooks, social media, to academic\npapers, etc. In total, these datasets contain 204\nunique labels, and we manually annotated 441 la-\nbel descriptions (Figure 2).\nTo evaluate ZSC, we need to deﬁne what counts\nas a task that the model has not seen during train-\ning time. While prior work considers different\nnotions of “unseen\" by disallowing the same la-\nbel or the same dataset to appear during training,\nour work deﬁnes “unseen\" more harshly by dis-\narXiv:2104.04670v5  [cs.CL]  8 Sep 2021\nGreat movie, must see!\nA total waste of time. \nClassiﬁcation Format\nclassify 0\n1\n[Question] Is the review positive? \nQuestion Answering Format\n[Context] Great movie, must see!\n[Context] A total waste of time. answer “No”\n“Yes”\nConvert\nMeta-tune\nEvaluate on Unseen Tasks\n(a) Task Conversion (b) Meta-tuning and Evaluation (c) Results\nSentiment Classification\nTopic Classification\nQuestion Categorization\nHate Speech Detection\nStance Classification\nFigure 1: (a) We convert the format to question answering. We manually annotate label descriptions (questions)\nourselves (Section 2). (b) We ﬁnetune the UniﬁedQA (Khashabi et al., 2020) model (with 770 M parameters) on a\ndiverse set of tasks (Section 4), and evaluate its 0-shot classiﬁcation (ZSC) performance on an unseen task.(c) For\neach label description (question) we evaluate the AUC-ROC score for the “Yes\" answer, and each dot represents a\nlabel description (Section 3). The x-value is the ZSC performance of UniﬁedQA; the y-value is the performance\nafter meta-tuning. In most cases, the y-value improves over the x-value (above the red line) and is better than\nrandom guesses (above the black line) by a robust margin (Section 5).\nallowing similar datasets. For example, we con-\nsider AG News topic classiﬁcation dataset (Zhang\net al., 2015) and the topic classiﬁcation dataset\nfrom Yin et al. (2019) to be similar, even though\ntheir sources and label spaces are different.\nMeta-tuning improves ZSC over UniﬁedQA for\nmost labels (Figure 1 (c)). Moreover, larger mod-\nels are better, and hence we forecast that meta-\ntuning would work for even larger models. We\nalso ﬁnd that the performance can be slightly im-\nproved by training on datasets similar to the test\ndataset, ensembling different label descriptions, or\ninitializing with a QA model (Section 5.1). All of\nour ﬁndings reliably hold under different robust-\nness checks (Section 5.2), and our approach out-\nperforms the previous SOTA Yin et al. (2019) us-\ning the same pre-training method (Section 5.3).\nOur results suggest two promising future di-\nrections (Section 6). First, large language mod-\nels’ (e.g. GPT-3) potential for zero-shot learn-\ning, as currently measured by context-prompting,\nmight have been broadly underestimated; meta-\ntuning might signiﬁcantly improve their perfor-\nmance. Second, community-wide efforts on ag-\ngregating and unifying datasets can scale up train-\ning and evaluation for zero-shot learning models.\nOn the ﬂip side, however, the meta-tuning ap-\nproach might incentivize providers of LM infer-\nence APIs to collect prompts from users, hence\npotentially leading to security, privacy, and fair-\nness concerns at a greater scale (Section A).\nContributions To summarize, we 1) curate a\ndataset of classiﬁcation datasets with expert an-\nnotated label descriptions. 2) demonstrate a sim-\nple approach to train models to perform zero-shot\nlearning, and 3) identify several factors that im-\nprove performance; in particular, larger pretrained\nmodels are better. 1\n2 Data\nWe gather a wide range of classiﬁcation datasets\nand unify them into the “ Yes\"/“No\" question an-\nswering format for binary classiﬁcation. Then we\ngroup similar datasets together to determine what\ncounts as unseen tasks during evaluation.\nGathering classiﬁcation datasets We collect\nclassiﬁcation datasets from Kaggle2, Huggingface\n(Wolf et al., 2020), SemEval 3, and other papers.\nWe looked through these sources and only con-\nsidered English classiﬁcation datasets. We also\nskipped the tasks that we felt were already bet-\nter represented by other datasets in our collection.\nThen we manually examined a few examples in\neach remaining dataset to make sure it seemed\nplausibly clean.\nThe goals of these classiﬁcation datasets in-\nclude, but are not limited to sentiment classiﬁca-\ntion (IMDB Reviews, Maas et al. (2011a)), topic\nclassiﬁcation (AG News, Zhang et al. (2015)),\ngrammaticality judgement (CoLA, Warstadt et al.\n(2018)), paraphrase detection (QQP 4), deﬁnition\n1Code and data available here: https://github.\ncom/ruiqi-zhong/Meta-tuning.\n2https://www.kaggle.com\n3https://semeval.github.io\n4https://www.kaggle.com/c/\nIs the review positive?\nDoes the user like this movie?\nIs the review negative?\nDoes the user ﬁnd this movie bad?\nMovie Review Classification\nPositive\nNegative\nTagsDataset Name\nLabels Descriptions\nReview\nManually \nAnnotated\nGood vs. Bad\nFigure 2: For each dataset, we annotate 1-3 descrip-\ntions for each label in the form of questions, and asso-\nciate it with a set of property tags.

(2016)), etc. The genre in-\ncludes academic papers, reviews, tweets, posts,\nmessages, articles, and textbooks. The compre-\nhensive list of datasets is in Appendix B. Overall,\nwe aim for a high diversity of tasks and genres by\nbuilding upon what the broader research commu-\nnity has studied. Our approach is complementary\nto that of Weller et al. (2020), which asks turkers\nto generate tasks, and that of Mishra et al. (2021),\nwhich generates tasks by decomposing existing\ntemplates used to construct reading comprehen-\nsion datasets. The concurrent work of Bragg et al.\n(2021) uniﬁes the evaluation for few-shot learn-\ning; their zero-shot evaluation setup is the closest\nto ours, and they used templates and verbalizers\n(Schick and Schütze, 2020a) to specify the seman-\ntics of a task.\nSome of our datasets are noisy and not peer re-\nviewed, or contain tasks that are too complicated\n(e.g. Multi-NLI, Williams et al. (2018)) for ZSC.\nTo make our evaluation more informative, we only\ninclude them for training but not testing. We make\nthese decisions before running our experiments in\nSection 5 to prevent selection bias.\nUnifying the dataset format We convert each\nclassiﬁcation dataset into a “Yes\"/“No\" question\nanswering format and provide label information\nin the question. For each label, we annotate 1-\n3 questions. If the label is null (for example, a\ntext that does not express a particular emotion in\nan emotion classiﬁcation dataset), we skip this la-\nbel. Three of the authors5 manually annotated 441\nquestions for 204 unique labels, and each question\nquora-question-pairs\n5One of them is a graduate student and the other two are\nundergrads; all of them study Computer Science and have\ntaken an NLP class.\nAre these two questions asking for the same thing?\nDoes the tweet contain irony?\nIs this news about world events?\nDoes the text contain a definition?\nIs the tweet an offensive tweet?\nIs the text objective?\nDoes the question ask for a numerical answer?\nIs the tweet against environmentalist initiatives?\nIs this abstract about Physics?\nDoes the tweet express anger?\nDoes the user dislike this movie?\nIs the sentence ungrammatical?\nIs this text expressing a need for evacuation?\nIs this text about Society and Culture?\nIs this a spam?\nFigure 3: Some example manually annotated label de-\nscriptions (questions). Three of the authors manually\nwrote 441 questions in total, and each of them is proof-\nread by at least another author.\nis proofread by at least another author. See Figure\n2 for a concrete example, and Figure 3 for some\nrepresentative label descriptions.\nAdditionally, some datasets contain thousands\nof labels (Chalkidis et al., 2019; Allaway and\nMcKeown, 2020). In this case, we use templates\nto automatically synthesize label descriptions and\nexclude them from evaluation.\nGrouping similar datasets Our goal is to test\nthe models’ ability to generalize to tasks that are\ndifferent enough from the training tasks. There-\nfore, at test time, we need to exclude not only\nthe same dataset that appeared in the meta-tuning\nphase, but also ones that are similar.\nThis poses a challenge: whether two datasets\nperform the same task involves subjective opinion,\nand there is no universally agreed deﬁnition. On\none extreme, most datasets can be counted as dis-\nsimilar tasks, since they have different label spaces\nand input distributions. On the other extreme, all\ndatasets can be considered the same task, since\nthey can all be uniﬁed into the question answer-\ning format.\nTo tackle this challenge, we create a set of tags,\neach describing a dataset property. The set of\ntags includes domain classiﬁcation, article, emo-\ntion, social-media, etc, and the full set of them\ncan be seen in Appendix C. Then we deﬁne the\nMovie Review Classification \nHotel Review Classification \nAirline Review Classification\nQuestion Paraphrase Detection \nAnswer Type Classification\nStance Classification \nLiberal/Conservative Classification\nHate Speech Detection \nOffensive Speech Detection\nReview\nGood vs. Bad\nSocial Media\nSocietal\nQuestion Categorization\nSocial Media\nSocietal\nEmotion\nFigure 4: Example dataset groups based on tags. We\nnever train and test on datasets from the same group,\ne.g. train on hotel review and test on movie review.\ntwo datasets to be similar if they are associated\nwith the same set of tags, and prohibit the model to\nlearn from one and test on the other. For example,\nour work considers the topic classiﬁcation datasets\nfrom Zhang et al. (2015) (AG News) and Yin et al.\n(2019) to be similar since they both classify top-\nics for articles, even though their sources and label\nspaces are different. Some example dataset groups\ncan be seen in Figure 4.\nNevertheless, our procedure is not bullet-proof\nand one can argue that our notion of unseen\ntasks, though harsher than prior works (Yin et al.,\n2019; Pushp and Srivastava, 2017), is still lenient.\nTherefore, as additional robustness checks, for\neach dataset we evaluate, we manually identify\nand list the most relevant dataset that is allowed\nduring training in Appendix F . For example, the\nmost relevant dataset to the IMDB review senti-\nment classiﬁcation dataset is the emotion classiﬁ-\ncation dataset from Yin et al. (2019), which clas-\nsiﬁes the input text into 9 emotions, such as “joy\",\n“surprise\", “guilt\", etc. We consider the emotion\nclassiﬁcation dataset to be relevant, since senti-\nment classiﬁcation often involves identifying emo-\ntions. However, one can also argue that they are\ndifferent tasks: their input and label spaces are\ndifferent, and sadness can be caused by a great\ntragedy, or a bad movie that wastes the users’\ntime. The comprehensive list of label descriptions\ngrouped by dataset similarity is in Appendix D.\nIn total, we spend around 200 hours to collect\nthis dataset. This time estimate includes skim-\nming through the dataset repos and recent NLP\npapers, writing programs to download the datasets\nand unify their format, annotating label descrip-\ntions, performing quality controls, and document-\ning the collection process.\n3 Metrics\nTo reliably aggregate performance across differ-\nent datasets and present as much information as\npossible, we report a set of descriptive statistics\nand provide visualizations whenever we compare\ntwo models. We generally do not reduce a model’s\nperformances on different datasets into one scalar\nquantity and compare this number only.\nDescriptive statistics For each label description\n(question), we calculate the AUC-ROC score 6 by\ntreating the “Yes\" answer as the positive class. Af-\nter calculating the AUC-ROC score for each label,\nwe calculate the following set of descriptive statis-\ntics to compare two models. Suppose that model\nY is hypothetically better than X. Denoting ∆\nas the change of AUC-ROC of a label description\nfrom X to Y , we can summarize how ∆ is dis-\ntributed across the set of label descriptions with\nthe following statistics:\n• E[∆]: the average change in AUC-ROC.\n• P[∆ > t]: the fraction of label descriptions\nwhere the change is over the threshold t.\n• P[∆ < −t]: the fraction of label descriptions\nwhere the change is less than −t.\n• Std[∆]: the standard deviation of the change.\nIn the main paper, we weight each label descrip-\ntion equally in this distribution to calculate the\nabove statistics. We may also weight each label or\ndataset equally, and the corresponding results are\nin Appendix E. To make sure our conclusions are\nrobust, we consider one model to be better only\nwhen E[∆] > 0 and P[∆ > t] > P[∆ < −t]\nfor all t ∈{1%, 5%, 10%}, under all three types\nof weighting. In other words, we claim that one\nmodel is better than the other only when 12 condi-\ntions simultaneously hold.\nVisualizations We use scatter plots to visual-\nize and compare the performance of two models,\nwhere each dot represents a label description, its x-\nvalue represents the AUC-ROC score of the model\nX, and its y-value represents that of Y . If most\ndots are above the identity line y = x, the model\nY is better than X.\nThe descriptive statistics and the visualizations\nare explained in Figure 5.\n6We do not evaluate F-score or accuracy, since they are\nvery sensitive to the decision cutoff, and usually additional\ncalibration is needed (Zhao et al., 2021).\nFigure 5: Each dot represents a label description, and\nits x/y-value each represents the performance of model\nX/Y (measured by AUC-ROC score). For example, on\nlabel description D1, model X/Y has AUC-ROC score\n0.5/0.65. If the dot is above the black line ( y = 0.5),\nmodel Y is performing better than random guesses. If\nthe dot is above the red line (y = x), model Y is better\nthan model X. Since one out of two dots are above\ny = x + 0.05, we have P[∆ > 5%] = 0.5.\n4 Model\nArchitecture We format the inputs to the model\nin the same way as UniﬁedQA (Khashabi et al.,\n2020), which concatenates the context to the ques-\ntion and adds a “ [SEP]\" token in between. Then\nwe feed the concatenated input into the T5 en-\ncoder and produce the answer score by normal-\nizing the “ Yes\"/“No\" probability of the ﬁrst de-\ncoded token. Unless otherwise noted, we initial-\nize our model with T5-Large (770 Million pa-\nrameters). We sometimes compare to or initial-\nize with the UniﬁedQA model (Khashabi et al.,\n2020), which is trained on a wide range of ques-\ntion answering datasets. For a fair comparison,\nwe use the UniﬁedQA model initialized with T5-\nLarge as well. To meta-tune non-Seq2Seq pre-\ntrained models, such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019)\nor RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019), we add an MLP\nlayer on top of the pooled output/“ [CLS]\" token\nto classify between “Yes\"/“No\". We leave the im-\nprovement on model architectures (Ye and Ren,\n2021; Li and Liang, 2021; Lester et al., 2021) and\ntraining objectives (Murty et al., 2021; Yin et al.,\n2020) for future work.\nMeta-tuning We create a training distribution\nthat balances between datasets, label descriptions,\nand “ Yes\"/“No\" answers. To create the next\ntraining datapoint for meta-tuning, we select a\ndataset from the training split uniformly at random\n(u.a.r.); then we select a label description (ques-\ntion) u.a.r. and with 50% probability select a tex-\ntual input with the answer “Yes\"/“No\". To prevent\nover-ﬁtting, we do not train on any combination of\nlabel description and textual input twice. Unless\notherwise noted, we meta-tune the model for 5000\nsteps and use batch size 32. We did not tune any\nhyper-parameters or training conﬁgurations since\nthey work well during our ﬁrst attempt. To evalu-\nate ZSC performance on each dataset, we leave out\none group of similar datasets as the evaluation set\nand train on the rest. Altogether, the experiments\ntake around 250 GPU hours on Quadro 8000.\n5 Results\n5.1 Hypotheses and Conclusions\nWe investigate and validate the following hypothe-\nses, sorted by importance in descending order.\n• Meta-tuned models outperform general ques-\ntion answering models in zero-shot classiﬁ-\ncation.\n• Larger pre-trained models are better.\n• Pre-training does the heavy lifting.\n• Performance can be improved by training\non similar datasets, initializing with a QA\nmodel, or ensembling label descriptions.\n• Early stopping is crucial to performance.\nMeta-tuned models are better. We compare a\nmeta-tuned T5-Large model (770 M parameters) 7\nwith the same-sized UniﬁedQA model (Khashabi\net al., 2020) out of the box. Relevant descriptive\nstatistics can be seen in the ﬁrst row of Table 1\nand Figure 6 (a). Adapting the model for ZSC im-\nproves the average AUC-ROC by 3.3%.\nLarger pre-trained models are better. We\ncompare T5-Base (220 Million parameters)\nagainst T5-Large (770 M). The statistics can be\nseen in the second row of Table 1 and Figure 6\n(b). Increasing the model size from 220 M to\n770M improves the average AUC-ROC by 6.3%.\n7This model is initialized with T5, not UniﬁedQA.\nE[∆] P[∆ > 1%] P[∆ < −1%] Std(∆)\nMeta-tuned vs. UniﬁedQA 3.3% 59.5% 28.1% 9.5%\nLarger 6.3% 75.1% 15.1% 8.1%\nPre-trained vs. Random 23.8% 95.7% 3.2% 14.0%\nTrain on Similar 0.7% 43.8% 20.5% 3.2%\nEnsemble Descriptions 0.7% 28.9% 16.8% 3.1%\nInitialize with UniﬁedQA 1.1% 54.1% 24.3% 6.9%\nTable 1: The statistics used to compare two models, introduced in Section 3. The larger E[∆] and the difference\nbetween P[∆ > 1%] and P[∆ < −1%], the better. Row 1 ﬁnds that a meta-tuned model is better than UniﬁedQA;\nrow 2 ﬁnds that the larger model is better; row 3 ﬁnds that pre-training does the heavy lifting; row 4, 5, and 6\nﬁnds that the performance can be improved by training on similar datasets, ensembling label descriptions, and\ninitializing with a UniﬁedQA model. Note that Std(∆) is the standard deviation of individual descriptions, not the\nstandard deviation of the estimated mean. Due to space constraint we only show t = 1% in this table.\nPre-training does the heavy lifting. In Figure\n(c) and the third row of Table 1, we compare pre-\ntrained and random initializations, where the latter\ncannot beat the random baseline (average AUC-\nROC 0.503). Hence, meta-tuning alone is far from\nenabling the model to perform ZSC. An intuitive\ninterpretation is that the model already “knows\"\nhow to perform ZSC after pre-training under the\nLM objective, and learns how to use this knowl-\nedge during meta-tuning.\nTraining on similar datasets improves perfor-\nmance. Unlike before, we no longer avoid train-\ning on similar datasets from the same group. In-\nstead, we perform straightforward leave-one-out\ncross-validation. The statistics can be seen in the\nfourth row of Table 1 and Figure 6 (d), and it im-\nproves the average AUC-ROC by 0.7%. The per-\nformance gain is not as signiﬁcant as increasing\nthe model size or adapting for ZSC. We conjecture\nthat it is because we have not collected enough\ndatasets; otherwise, there might be more similar\ndatasets, hence improving ZSC performance.\nEnsembling label descriptions improves perfor-\nmance. Instead of asking the model a single\nquestion for each label and obtain the probabil-\nity of the answer being “Yes\", we can average the\nprobability obtained by asking multiple questions\nwith the same meaning. This approach is differ-\nent from traditional ensembling, which typically\nneeds to store/train multiple models to average\nacross them. The ﬁfth row of Table 1 and Figure 6\n(e) veriﬁes that ensembling descriptions improves\nperformance slightly (0.7% AUC-ROC score).\nInitializing with UniﬁedQA improves perfor-\nmance. Figure 6 (f) and the sixth row of Table 1\ncompare the UniﬁedQA against against the T5 ini-\ntialization. Initializing with UniﬁedQA improves\naverage AUC-ROC by 1.1%.\nEarly stopping is crucial to performance. If\nwe train the model for too long, the model might\nsimply “memorize\" that certain label descriptions\ncorrespond to certain training tasks, and the per-\nformance on unseen tasks may drop. To explore\nthis possibility, we meta-tune our models for 100K\nsteps, which is 20 times as long as our default set-\nting and encourages the model to memorize the\ntraining tasks. We then evaluate them on the three\nbenchmark zero-shot classiﬁcation datasets by Yin\net al. (2019) (which we describe in more details in\nthe next section). We calculate the average AUC-\nROC across all label descriptions for each of the 3\ndatasets, and plot them in Figure 7.\nThe performance decreases 8 as training con-\ntinues. On the other hand, however, the perfor-\nmance drop of 3% in AUC-ROC is not fatal and\nthe model’s performance is still much better than\nrandom guesses.\n5.2 Robustness Checks\nWe examine a series of additional results to make\nsure our conclusions are robust. The observed\nimprovements in Table 1 and Figure 6 might be\ncaused by the improvement of a small number of\nlabels that are annotated with more descriptions,\nor by the improvement on a dataset with more\ndistinct labels.

One concern, however,\nis that our models are initialized with T5 (Raffel\net al., 2019), which is trained on the open web and\nmight have seen the datasets we gathered. There-\nModel emotion situation topic\nYin et al. (2019) 25.2 38.0 52.1\nMeta-tuned 28.2 48.4 54.3\nTable 2: “Prior\" means the best performing system\nfrom Yin et al. (2019) for each dataset; “Meta-tuned\"\nmeans meta-tuning on RoBERTa. Our approach is bet-\nter on all three datasets.\nfore, larger models might be better simply because\nthey are better at memorization (Sagawa et al.,\n2020). Appendix E.3 addresses this by showing\nthat larger models are also better with BERT ini-\ntialization (Devlin et al., 2019), which is trained\non Wikipedia and Book Corpus (Zhu et al., 2015).\nWe also report the models’ performance on each\ndataset for readers’ reference in Appendix G.\n5.3 Comparison with Yin et al. (2019)\nThis section shows that our approach has higher\nperformance than the zero-shot classiﬁcation sys-\ntem built by Yin et al. (2019). Their system en-\nsembles several natural language inference models\nbased on RoBERTA-Large (355M parameters, Liu\net al. (2020)), and another model trained to catego-\nrize Wikipedia articles. It was evaluated on three\nclassiﬁcation datasets:\n• topic (10-way): classiﬁes article domains,\nsuch as family & relationship, education,\nsports, etc. The metric is accuracy.\n• emotion (10-way): classiﬁes emotion types,\nsuch as joy, anger, guilt, shame, etc. The met-\nric is label-weighted F1.\n• situation (12-way): classiﬁes disaster situa-\ntions, e.g. regime change, crime & violence,\nand the resource they need, e.g.search & res-\ncue. The metric is label-weighted F1.\nWe use the exact same evaluation metrics as in\nYin et al. (2019), and the same label resolution\nstrategy when the model answers “Yes\"9 for multi-\nlabel classiﬁcation. Concretely, when the model\npredicts “Yes\" on multiple labels, the one with the\nhighest probability is selected. For a fair compari-\nson, we meta-tune RoBERTa of the same size and\ncompare it with the highest performing model in\nYin et al. (2019) for each of the three datasets.\nThe results are in Table 2, and our model has\nhigher performance across all 3 datasets using the\nsame pre-training method.\n6 Discussion and Future Directions\nMain takeaways We construct a dataset of clas-\nsiﬁcation datasets to adapt the language model\nfor zero-shot classiﬁcation via meta-tuning. The\nadapted model outperforms a general-purpose\nquestion answering model and the prior state of\nthe art based on natural language inference. We\nforecast that meta-tuning would be more effective\non larger models, and the current engineering ceil-\ning for zero-shot learning might have been broadly\nunder-estimated.\nAggregating and unifying datasets The main\nbottleneck of our research is to manually gather a\nwide range of datasets and unify their format. The\ndifﬁculties are: 1) we need to brainstorm and re-\nview the NLP literature extensively to decide what\nnew tasks to look for; 2) different datasets en-\ncode their data in different formats, and we need to\nwrite programs manually for each of them to con-\nvert to the desired format; 3) it is hard to tell the\nquality of a dataset purely by its provenance, and\nsometimes we need to examine the dataset manu-\nally. If we as a community can aggregate and unify\ndatasets better, we could potentially train and eval-\nuate zero-shot learning models at a larger scale.\n9or “Entailment\" for natural language inference models.\nMeta-tuning as a probe There is a growing in-\nterest in measuring the intelligence (Hendrycks\net al., 2021a,b) or the few-shot learning ability\n(Brown et al., 2020) of large language models\nlike GPT-3. However, since these models are not\nadapted to answer those prompts (Holtzman et al.,\n2021), we suspect that its knowledge and true\npotential to perform few-shot learning is much\nhigher than reported. Since pre-training does the\nheavy lifting and meta-tuning is unlikely to pro-\nvide additional ZSC ability to the model, we can\npotentially ﬁrst use meta-tuning as a probe to make\nthem adapted to answering prompts before mea-\nsuring their performance.\nStill, to make this methodology rigorous, inter-\npreting and controlling the strength of the probes\nwill be an important future direction (Hewitt and\nLiang, 2019). For example, if the training set con-\ntains a prompt that is too similar to the prompt to\nbe tested, the probe will be meaningless.\nBeyond Shallow Correlations One possibility\nis that the model only learns shallow statistical\ncorrelations from meta-tuning rather than “more\nsophisticated reasoning skills\". For example, the\nword “exciting\" might occur in positive reviews\nmore. This is unlikely, given that larger models\nare consistently better than smaller or randomly\ninitialized ones. To explain this performance gap,\nlarger models must have learned to use more com-\nplicated features during meta-tuning.\nRelation to Meta/Multitask-Learning Our\nmethod is closely related to, but different from\nmeta-learning (Yin, 2020; Murty et al., 2021)\nand multi-task learning (Ye et al., 2021; Agha-\njanyan et al., 2021). Both meta-learning and\nmultitask-learning typically involve at least a\nfew examples from the target task; in our setup,\nhowever, the model does not learn from any target\ntask examples. The “meta” in our name does not\nmean “meta-learning”, but reﬂects the fact that\nour model learns from a meta-dataset of tasks.\nNevertheless, our framework can be easily\nadapted to a few-shot learning setup, which en-\nables the language model to learn to learn from in-\ncontext examples (see below). Since this approach\nmodels the learning process as a sequence classi-\nﬁcation problem, it can be seen as a form of meta-\nlearning similar to (Ravi and Larochelle, 2016).\nAnnotating Prompts Three of our authors an-\nnotated the label descriptions. Since they are all\nComputer Science major students who understand\nmachine learning and natural language processing,\nthey might not be representative of the ﬁnal user\npopulation of this ZSC application. Annotating\nprompts that match the target user distribution will\nbe an important research direction.\nAdditionally, shorter and more natural descrip-\ntions sometimes fail to capture the exact seman-\ntics of the label. For example, in Yin et al. (2019),\nthe description of the label “medical\" is “ people\nneed medical assistance \"; or alternatively, it can\nbe longer but more accurate: “ people need an al-\nlied health professional who supports the work of\nphysicians and other health professionals \". How\nto scalably generate more accurate and detailed la-\nbel descriptions without expert efforts will be an-\nother future direction.\nOptimizing Prompts Our work is complemen-\ntary to recent works that optimize the prompts\nto achieve better accuracy. Even if our meta-\ntuned model is specialized in answering prompts,\nit might still react very differently towards differ-\nent prompts. For example, in the stance classiﬁ-\ncation dataset (Barbieri et al., 2020), we annotated\ntwo label descriptions (prompts) for the same la-\nbel: “Does this post support atheism?\" and “Is the\npost against having religious beliefs?\". They have\nsimilar meanings, but the former has much lower\naccuracy than the later. We conjecture that this\nis because the model cannot ground abstract con-\ncepts like “atheism\".\nOther extensions We conjecture that meta-\ntuning can be extended to more diverse tasks be-\nyond zero-shot binary classiﬁcation. To extend\nto multi-label classiﬁcation, we need to develop\na procedure to resolve the labels when the model\npredicts positive for more than one labels. To ex-\ntend to few-shot learning, we need to increase the\ncontext length to ﬁt several training examples into\nthe input, which requires a larger context window\nand hence more computational resources. To ex-\ntend to other sequence generation tasks, we need\nto collect a wide range of diverse sequence genera-\ntion tasks to meta-tune the model, such as machine\ntranslation, summarization, free-form question an-\nswering, grammar correction, etc.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Eric Wallace for his feedbacks through-\nout the project.

In Proceedings of the IEEE\ninternational conference on computer vision , pages\n19–27.\nA Ethics\nData and incentives In the existing prompting\nframework, end users send the natural language\ndescriptions and a few training examples to the\nlarge language model inference API to perform\nfew-shot learning (Brown et al., 2020). This be-\ncomes a natural source of training data for meta-\ntuning. Hence, the success of meta-tuning pre-\nsented in this paper might incentivize for-proﬁt\norganizations who provide language model infer-\nence APIs to collect prompts from the users, and\ntrain on these data.\nPrivacy, security, and fairness If a model is\nmeta-tuned on user-provided data, certain secu-\nrity, privacy and fairness concerns can potentially\nemerge. For example, Carlini et al. (2020) shows\nthat it is possible to extract the training data from\nlarge language models, and hence meta-tuned sys-\ntems might expose some users’ prompts to other\nusers. Wallace et al. (2020) shows that it is possi-\nble to poison the model through training data and\ntrigger unwanted behaviors; the meta-tuning pro-\ncedure might be susceptible to these data poison-\ning attacks as well. Finally, meta-tuning might\nperpetuate existing societal biases hidden in the\nusers’ prompts (Bolukbasi et al., 2016).\nIf not addressed properly, these concerns might\nhave a broader negative societal impact through\nmeta-tuning. Compared to other domain-speciﬁc\nand task-speciﬁc machine learning applications,\nmeta-tuned models might be applied to a much\nwider range of tasks, deployed at a larger scale,\nand serving a more diverse set of user population.\nTherefore, biased or poisoned training data for one\ntask from one user population might compromise\nfairness and performance of another task and harm\nanother user population; additionally, malicious or\nbiased data might even tamper with the few-shot\nlearning capability (“meta-poisoning\").\nPotential abuse As shown in Figure 6, the\nAUC-ROC score for a lot of tasks are still well\nbelow 0.9, and hence our system is far from solv-\ning a signiﬁcant fraction of tasks. Therefore, even\nthough our system is ﬂexible and has the poten-\ntial to perform a wide range of tasks, it does not\npresent an elixir to all classiﬁcation tasks. Par-\nticularly, it should not be applied to higher stake\nscenarios (e.g. hate speech detection, fake news\ndetection, etc), since its efﬁcacy, robustness, and\nfairness properties remain unknown.\nB Datasets\nIMDB movie review sentiment classiﬁcation\n(Maas et al., 2011b).

Some examples in-\nclude stance classiﬁcation and hate speech detec-\ntion.\ntopic classiﬁcation: whether the task classiﬁes\nthe topics of the input.\n26https://www.kaggle.com/rmisra/\nimdb-spoiler-dataset?select=IMDB_\nreviews.json\n27https://www.kaggle.com/rmisra/\nnews-category-dataset\ngood vs. bad : whether the task classiﬁes\nwhether the text is judging something to be good\nor bad.\npaper: whether input text comes from a paper.\nreview: whether the input text is a review of a\nproduct (e.g. movie, hotel).\nquestions: whether the input texts are questions.\nSome examples include classifying whether the\nquestion asks for factual information or subjective\nopinion and detecting whether two questions have\nthe same meaning.\nemotion: whether the task classiﬁes certain\nemotion in the text, for example “hate\", “surprise\",\n“joy\", etc.\nBesides, we do not assign tags to datasets that\nwe are conﬁdent to be different enough from other\ntasks (e.g. extracting whether a text contains def-\ninition), and allow the model to be meta-tuned on\nall other datasets.\nD List of Label Descriptions\nThe comprehensive list of label descriptions and\ngrouping can be seen in Figure 8, 9, and 10.\nE Robustness Checks\nWe report all the descriptive statistics mentioned\nin Section 3 under 3 different types of descrip-\ntion weighting. We additionally compare T5-small\nvs. T5-base, BERT-medium vs. BERT-Base and\nBERT-Base vs. BERT Large. All the results can\nbe seen in Table 3, 4, and 5 Due to space con-\nstraint, we abbreviate P[∆ > t] as > tif t is pos-\nitive, and < t if t is negative. Notice that, since\nwe only have around 20 datasets to evaluate the\nmodel, most of the results presented here are not\nstatistically signiﬁcant at the dataset level; never-\ntheless,\nE.1 Different Description Weighting\nWe weight each label and dataset equally in Table\n4 and 5. We ﬁnd that, under almost all compar-\nisons across different weighting, the mean change\n¯∆ is positive, and the change above a certain\nthreshold t is more frequent than the change below\na certain threshold −t. The only single exception\nthe “Ensemble\" row in Table 5, where there are\nslightly more datasets where the change is lower\nthan -1%. Nevertheless, given that the trend is still\npositive under t = 5% and 10%, and two other\ndescription weightings, we may still conclude that\nensembling label descriptions is more likely to im-\nprove model performance.\nE.2 Larger T5 Models are Better\nIn addition to comparing T5-Base (220 Million\nparameters) vs. T5-Large (770M), we also com-\npare T5-small (60M) vs. T5-base (220M). Across\nall metrics, larger models are signiﬁcantly better.\nMost notably, there is a sudden jump in perfor-\nmance when increasing model size from T5-small\nto T5-base (sometimes 15% increase in ¯∆).\nE.3 Larger BERT Models are Better\nWe also compare different sizes of BERT (Turc\net al., 2019) (41, 110, and 330M) parameters.\nAcross all metrics, larger models are signiﬁcantly\nbetter.\nF Most Relevant Datasets\nTo ensure that we are testing the models’ ability\nto generalize to an unseen tasks, we disallow both\ntraining and testing on datasets that are too sim-\nilar, which is deﬁned as “having the same set of\ndataset property tags\" (Section 2). To help inter-\npret how we deﬁne unseen tasks, for each dataset\nthat we evaluate on, we try to ﬁnd the “most rel-\nevant\" dataset that the model has seen during the\nmeta-tuning phase, and list it in Table 6.\nG Performance Break Down\nFor each model, we average the AUC-ROC scores\nfor each label description for each dataset, and re-\nport the results in Table 7.\nH Accuracy\n========= GROUP 0
