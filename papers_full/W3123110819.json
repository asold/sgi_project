Although CTs use iron \ncore to maximize the flux linkage between primary and \nsecondary windings, they are prone to saturation due to \nthe non-linear magnetic characteristics of core.\nThe effective factors on the CT saturation are: short \ncircuit level, short circuit occurrence location, fault resis -\ntance and fault angle. Among the above mentioned fac -\ntors, the first three factors affect the severity of the fault \ncurrent and the fourth factor determines the polarity and \nthe magnitude of the exponential component of fault cur -\nrent. For operating conditions above the knee point of \nthe magnetization curve, magnetizing current increases \nsignificantly. Therefore, the ratio error increases and \nresults in distortion of the output signal. One way to \nlimit this effect is either using CT with higher nominal \ncharacteristics or to use special algorithms to compen -\nsate this phenomenon. Since using CT with higher nomi -\nnal characteristics is not cost-effective economically, soft \ncompensation of CT saturation phenomenon in power sys -\ntem is an appropriate solution, which results in cost reduc -\ntion and increase of the power system reliability [1].\nA compensation method is suggested in [1] in which \nafter estimating the magnetizing current, this current \nis added to the measured secondary current to correct \nthe distorted secondary current. This algorithm works \nwell for different fault conditions but the residual flux is \nconsidered zero before the fault occurrence. The proposed \nalgorithm in [2] calculates the core flux and detects the \nsaturation of CT under different conditions. However, in \nthis method the initial flux is considered zero in the begin -\nning of calculation, which is not appropriate assumption \nunder real conditions.\n54|Taghipour Gorji et al.\nPeriod. Polytech. Elec. Eng. Comp. Sci., 65(1), pp. 53–61, 2021\nThe different order of secondary current signal devia -\ntion is also applied to detect the saturation [3–8]. A com-\nbination of second-order derivation and zero-passing \ntechnique is also applied to improve the detection of satu -\nration time internal. In this method, only saturation cycles \nare detected and the start and the end points of satura -\ntion time intervals are not determined [5]. In [8], the sec-\nondary current and its derivatives are used in order to \ncompensate the saturation of current transformer. In [7] \nand [9], a method is presented to detect the saturation of \nCT based on third-order derivative of secondary current. \nIn these papers, the effect of the anti-aliasing low-pass \nfilter is also considered. A method for detection of sat -\nuration is suggested in [10] by calculating the mean and \nthe variance of the fault. In [11], a method is presented \nfor detection and compensation of the saturated second -\nary current by using the derivatives of secondary current \nand Newton backward differential formula. The proposed \nmethod is dependent on an index as the saturation detec -\ntion criterion. This index is consistently compared with an \nexpected value while the start point and the end point of \nsaturation area can be detected. A low-pass filter is used to \nremove the noise and harmonics contents of the secondary \ncurrent. This method is simulated by taking into account \nthe residual flux of core, burden of CT as well as the DC \ncomponent and the noise of the current signal. Regarding \nthe advantages of differential methods such as simplicity \nof calculations and the possibility of their implementation \nin on-time applications, these methods have suffered from \nsome difficulties such as very high dependency on sam-\npling frequency, high sensitivity to noise, high depen -\ndency of detected output signal to the strength and weak -\nness of the CT's core saturation [11].\nWavelet transform as a signal analysis tool within the \ndomain of time and frequency can determine the begin -\nning and the end points of saturation [12–14]. In wavelet \ntransform based methods, the current signals are decom -\nposed into two levels of approximation and detail in dif -\nferent stages by using some determined filters called \nmother wavelet [12]. Detail level including the contents \nof high frequency components, can be employed to rec -\nognize the saturation time interval. The main problem of \nwavelet transform and derivative based methods is noise \nsensitivity. Therefore, before applying these methods, the \nsignal should be passed through the low-pass filters [13].\nIn many articles, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) \nare utilized for detection and correction of CT satura -\ntion [15–17]. The current samples of CT secondary side \nare applied for training the neural network. In [18, 19], \na method is suggested to detect the saturation of CT using \nANN trained by Genetic Algorithm (GA). The main prob -\nlem of ANN based method is that a large number of train -\ning data is needed during learning process. This method \nrequires so many parameters, which should be set in order \nto achieve optimal and efficient structure [18].\nIn this paper, Support Vector Regression (SVR) method \nis presented for detection and correction of the CT second -\nary current in saturation conditions. SVRs have the capa -\nbility to learn training patterns and can be utilized as either \nclassifier or regression tool. Compared to ANN, SVRs \nhave less adjustable parameters and simpler structure [20]. \nIn this paper, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method \nis presented to optimize the SVR model parameters val -\nues. This new structure is presented as PSO-SVR method.\n2 Test study\nAs shown in Fig. 1, a part of a high voltage substation \nin Iran [21, 22], including a power transformer, ground -\ning transformer and CTs is modeled in PSCAD software. \nThe specification of the power transformer and CTs are \npresented by Tables 1 and 2, respectively. In order to \nmodel the residual flux, current sources are inserted in the \nprimary side. To examine a wide range of faults, various \nfaults were applied inside and outside the protected areas \nconsidering with different resistances.\nIt must be noted that the CTs are simulated based on \nthe Jiles-Atherton (JA) model [21]. This model is based \non the phenomenological model of a ferromagnetic core \nand the relationship between the magnetic moment and \nFig. 1 Power system modeled in PSCAD\nTable 1 Power Transformer Characteristics\nTechnical Data Value\nRated Power (MVA) 160\nRated Voltage Ratio (kV/kV) 230/63\nConnection Y/∆\nFrequency (Hz) 50\nLeakage Reactance (p.u.) 0.14\nNo-Load Losses (p.u.) 0.002\nCopper Losses (p.u.) 0.004\nTaghipour Gorji et al.\nPeriod.

Currently used mod -\nels, use mathematical techniques, which approximate the \nbehavior of the hysteresis loop for recoil loops and rena -\nscence effects [22, 23]. For many studies, these models are \nquite adequate except where accurate values of renascence \nare required following a circuit interruption with a subse -\nquent reclose into a live circuit. This feature is particularly \nimportant in relay studies where it is necessary to simu -\nlate successive faults due to reclosing of a permanent fault. \nDuring validation of the new model against recordings \nfrom a synthetic test plant, the shape of the loop in the \nshoulder area was also found to be critical in situations \nwhere the burden was small (as in digital relays) and the \ncore carried residual flux. In situations where the burden \nis large, which leads to severe saturation, the exact shape \nof the loop was not critical. The latter situation is the one \nthat most often used in simulation studies [23]. Jiles and \nAtherton used a soft magnetic material for their investi -\ngation and modeled the saturation characteristic using \na modified Langevin function. In JA model, by solving the \nbasic equations [21], model parameters can be determined \nby maximizing the accurate estimation of the curve of the \nmagnetic CT core. Since the magnetizing curve is avail -\nable, the above mentioned parameters can be determined \nby using random search methods. In this article, the PSO \nmethod is used to determine the JA parameters. CT core \nmagnetizing curve is shown in Fig. 2 and JA model param-\neters can be found in Table 3.\n3 Support Vector Regression (SVR)\nSVR method (Fig. 3) is one of the supervised learning \nmethods, which is widely used to solve complicated data \nclassification and regression problems [24]. The SVR algo-\nrithm can be easily implemented in other machine learn -\ning problems such as function fitting. Unlike other meth -\nods such as Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Adaptive \nNeuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) that try to min -\nimize the modeling error, in SVR method, operational \nrisk is considered as target function. In this method, using \nKernel core functions technique and by determining \nits parameters, indeed an intelligent Radial Basis Function \n(RBF) will be achieved, which all of the operational pro -\ncedure will be automatically optimized. In the regres -\nsion by SVR, the non-linear and complicated relation -\nship between input and output is estimated [20].

Polytech. Elec. Eng. Comp. Sci., 65(1), pp. 53–61, 2021\nof pattern recognition problems that have discrete output \n(0 and 1), regression problems outputs are real numbers.\nThe basis of SVR performance in non-linear regres -\nsion is to predict the target curve with the maximum con -\nfidence margin. To solve the equation and find the target \nregression curve, Quadratic Programming (QP) methods \nare used, which are well-known for solving the optimiza -\ntion problems. For solving non-linear problems with high \ndimensions, Lagrangean dual theorem is used to convert \nthe desired minimization problem into its dual form [25].\nThe first step in creation of SVR model is to select \na non-linear mapping algorithm as a kernel function \nthrough which the input vectors are mapped into a high \ndimensional space. In this space, simpler linear regres -\nsions can be replaced with complex non-linear regressions \nof the original input space [25]. To perform regression, \nit is assumed that l pair of training data for learning pro -\ncess is as follows: \nDx iy iR Ri ln= ()  () ∈× =…{} ,, ,, ,12  (1)\nyf xw wx b= () =× () +,. ϕ  (2)\nEquation (1) includes l pair of sample data \n( x1 , y1 ), …, ( xn , yn ), in which the inputs of n dimensional \nvectors of xR n∈  and the outputs of unidimensional vec -\ntor yR∈ , are in the form of real numbers. In Eq. (2), w is \nthe matrix of the regression weight vector, b is bias, ϕ(x) \nis a non-linear function by which x is mapped into a high \ndimensional space. In the mapping process, a kernel func -\ntion is constructed by Kx xx x, ′() = () × ′()()φφ . Kernel \nfunctions which can be implemented in SVR method are \nvery variant [26]. In this paper, Gaussian (RBF) kernel \nfunction is used to obtain optimal solution (i.e. Eq. (3)). \nThe RBF kernel is generally applied most frequently \nbecause it has few adjustment parameters as well as \na desired performance in high-volume data.\nKx x xx\ni\ni\n,e xp ,() =− −\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n22γ\n (3)\nwhere xi is the input vector and γ is the parameter of the \nRBF kernel function.\nThe obtained answer for the regression hyperplane of \nfx ww xb,() =× () +φ  will produce a non-linear regres -\nsion hyperplane in the main input space. Total risk value \nand the norm of w should simultaneously be minimized.\nTherefore, a linear regression hyperplane and risk \nminimization is obtained employing Lagrangian tech -\nniques as follows:\nminimize\nRw wCwb\nT\nii\ni\nl\n,, ,\n*\n*ξξ ξξ=+ +()\n\n\n\n=\n∑\n1\n2 1\n (4)\nsubject to\nyw xb\nwx by\niN\ni\nT\nii\nT\nii i\nii\n− () +() ≤+\n() +() −≤ +\n≥\n=…\nφε ξ\nφε ξ\nξξ\n*\n*,\n,, ,.\n0\n12\n (5)\nIn the above equations, C is penalty factor, which deter-\nmines the penalty value for the violation of samples from \nthe allowed error of regression. N i s  t h e  n u m b e r  o f  t h e  \nsamples. ε is the error tolerance parameter, which is con -\nsidered 0.001 in this paper. ξn  and ξn\n*  are positive aux -\niliary variables, which determine the violation level of \ntraining data from up and down limits of ε. ξn  represents \nthe upper training errors subject to ε and ξn\n*  represents \nthe lower training errors subject to ε.\nC and γ are two main parameters in SVR method \nby RBF kernel implementation, which should appro -\npriately be adjusted for desired performance of algo -\nrithm [27, 28]. Parameter C expresses the cost value of \nviolation penalty. The value C is effective on the regres -\nsion precision and the performance of SVR system. If C \nis selected very large, the accuracy of regression will be \nhigh in the training phase, but in testing phase the accu -\nracy will be very low. If C is selected very small, the accu -\nracy of training phase will be very low and the appropriate \nmodel will not be obtained. The parameter γ has an effect \nmore than that of C in SVR model. High value of γ causes \nover-fitting and very small value of it causes under-fitting. \nIn this paper, PSO method is employed to optimize the \nSVR parameters value [29].\n4 The presented CT saturation detection model\nIn this section, PSO-SVR hybrid model is presented \nfor regression in high-dimensional data. In this method, \nthe purpose is to enhance the precision of prediction and \nregression using determination of the appropriate struc -\nture of the input data and adjustment of RBF kernel and \nSVR parameters. This study employs the PSO technique \nfor proper setting of adjustable parameters. Two other \ndecision variables i.e. C and γ should also be determined. \nFirstly, the population of particles is initialized. Each parti-\ncle has a random position within the D-dimensional space \nand a random velocity for each dimension. At second step, \nfor each particle, the fitness i.e. the regression accuracy is \nTaghipour Gorji et al.\nPeriod. Polytech. Elec. Eng. Comp. Sci., 65(1), pp. 53–61, 2021 |57\ncalculated. If the fitness is better than the particle's best fit -\nness, then the position vector is saved for the particle. If the \nparticle›s fitness is better than the global best fitness, then \nthe position vector is saved for the global best. Finally, the \nparticle's velocity and position are updated until the ter -\nmination condition is satisfied [30–33]. Fig. 4 shows the \narchitecture of the developed PSO-based parameter deter -\nmination approach for SVR model.\nFor preparation of input data, we collect the necessary \ninformation from primary and secondary current in the \nevent of faults and the secondary current that has been \ndistorted by saturation. Sampling frequency in this project \nis 2.5 kHz. To cover a wide range of faults, different faults \nat different times within the protection area and outside \nof it are applied by different resistances. In order to cover \nall of the fault conditions, 20  SVR systems are considered \nfor CT saturation compensation.\nEach SVR system designed for a short range of time \nconstant value and each one includes different fault ampli -\ntude. For each SVR system, the input matrix P and the \ndesirable output T is created for training stage. In the first \nmoments after the fault occurrence, data are healthy in the \nsecondary current signal before the saturation. By taking \nthe first 8 healthy samples in secondary current, the  first 7 \nsamples is considered as the first column elements of \nP matrix and the 8 th sample is considered as the first ele -\nment of output matrix. Then, the second to eighth samples \ncreate the second column of the matrix P and ninth sample \ncreate the second element of matrix T and so on.\nP\nPP\nPP\nTT T\nN\nss N\nN\n=\n…\n…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=…[]\n11 1\n1\n11 1\n/vertellipsis/downslopeellipsis/vertellipsis\n (6)\nIn the next step, kernel function and its parame -\nters as well as SVR parameters should be determined. \nThe main advantage of this method is that there is a few \nadjustable parameters during training of the SVR system \nfor regression. By choosing the RBF kernel function, γ and \nC parameters are determined by PSO method.\nAfter determining the model coefficients and running \nthe program, the Lagrange coefficients α and α*\n will be \ncalculated. Support vectors are those that ( α − α*\n) is non-\nzero for them. In the next step bias coefficient b will be \ncalculated and finally, we have all the parameters of the \nmodel in Eq.

In order to analyze the per -\nformance of the model, five indicators are determined \nincluding the Absolute Error (AE), Relative Error (RE), \nFig. 4 The architecture of the proposed PSO-SVR method\n58|Taghipour Gorji et al.\nPeriod.

But selecting the structure of ANN and \nits parameters adjustment and the huge number of data \nthat are needed for training ANN, are serious challenges. \nHowever, this method is highly sensitive to changes in the \nstructure of the power system so that any changes can lead \nto a lack of efficiency and accuracy of this method in pre -\ndicting the target signal.\nSaturated current prediction using SVR that its param -\neters are determined by PSO algorithm, is shown in Fig. 7. \nFor the fault current with 5.711 kA amplitude and the time \nconstant 89.17 ms, the RMSE reached to 0.0182 that is \nvery small and acceptable for practical applications. \nAccording to the tolerance of error in Fig.  7 (c), predicted \nsignal has very small deviation from the target signal. \nBy PSO-SVR hybrid method and the performance of the \nsupport vectors, the deviation of the predicted signal is \nlimited to small quantities. The results of anticipated sat -\nurated current with PSO-SVR method provided in Table 5 \nfor different values of waveform amplitude and time con -\nstant (Fig.  8). As shown, the error indices have small and \ndesirable values.\n6 Conclusion\nIn this paper, a new hybrid algorithm is presented based on \nSVR for compensation of CT saturation. There are a few \nadjustable parameters in the structure of SVR model such \nas Non-sensitive area parameter ( ε), penalty factor (C) and \nparameters related to the kernel function. In this paper, \nPSO-SVR hybrid model is presented to determine the \noptimal values of adjustable parameters. The main advan -\ntages of the proposed intelligent method are low compu -\ntational burden and high stability and robustness in the \npresence of noise and sudden changes in current samples. \nBecause of few numbers of adjustable parameters and \nhigh training capabilities, the SVR method is an appro -\npriate tool to compensate the fault current of CTs in sat -\nuration mode in real time implementation. The obtained \nresults justify the applicability of the proposed method to \neffectively compensate the CT saturated secondary cur -\nrent for different operating conditions.\nAcknowledgement\nThe authors acknowledge the funding support of \"Babol \nNoshirvani University of Technology\" Grant program \nNumbers BNUT/390066/99 and BNUT/370199/99.\nTable 4 Prediction results by ANN method\nPrediction by ANN MethodFault \nCurrent Prediction Error Indexes (  × 10−3 )\nσμRMSEMSER (%)τ (ms)Im (KA)\n280345445.2198.299.889.175.711\n2039143.71.999.925.75.671\n10135169.528.799.915.075.553\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\nFig. 7  PSO-SVR prediction for the fault current with 5.711 kA \namplitude and the time constant 89.17 ms.
