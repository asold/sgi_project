For that reason, \nthere are several factors that negatively affect distribution \ntransformer operations and especially its electrical \ninsulation system. Traditionally mineral oil has been used \nas insulating material because of good performance, low \ncost and suitable viscosity, but its main problems are \nassociated with its low biodegradability. Hence, in the last \nyears there is a growing interest in using vegetable oils as \nenvironmentally friendly coolant and insulating system \ninstead of mineral oils. These fluids are currently being \nGomez et al.\n2293\nV ol. 22, No. 12, 2011\nused in the range of small to medium distribution power \ntransformers.2\nStructurally, vegetable oils are mixtures of natural \nfatty acid esters and are an ideal alternative to replace \nthe commonly used mineral oils due to their naturally \noccurring and renewable sources, their fast biodegradation \nrates (reducing environmental risks) and for reducing the \nburning risk due to their higher fire points than mineral \noils.3 Nevertheless, there are still some technical issues \nthat need to be answered before introducing definitively \nthis new dielectric insulating and coolant fluid for \ndistribution transformers, which encourage the scientific \ncommunity to continue searching for more information \nabout the performance and properties of insulating \nvegetable oils. The purpose of this work is to evaluate \nthe structural changes between an unused dielectric \nvegetable oil sample with respect to several used and \naccelerated aged samples of the same oil by comparing \ntheir corresponding UV-Vis, IR and NMR spectra. These \nfinding should afford useful structural information to \nsearch for an alternative spectroscopy-based monitoring \nprocedure for distribution transformers using vegetable \noils as their dielectric insulation systems.\nExperimental\nThe vegetable dielectric coolant sample (I) studied in this \nwork corresponded to Envirotemp® FR3® from COOPER \nPower Systems company. Also were studied three used \nFR3® oil samples corresponding to: (II) 4 months aged \nFR3® oil sample removed from an experimental distribution \ntransformer installed at EPM (Medellin, Colombia) \n(1000 kV A 3-phase padmount, 13200-214/123.6 V , average \ntop oil temperature < 65 oC, 80% of rated load), (III) 8 months \naged FR3 ® oil sample removed from an experimental \ndistribution transformer installed at GRALTA (Universidad \ndel Valle, Colombia) (5 kV A single phase, 76220-240/120 V , \naverage top oil temperature 110 oC, 200% of rated load) and \n(IV) 7 years aged FR3® oil sample removed from a distribution \ntransformer installed in (Brazil) (45 kV A, 11.9-0.22/0.127 kV ,  \naverage top oil temperature < 65 oC). The solvents and \nchemicals used (ethanol, ethyl acetate, dichloromethane, \nchloroform, sodium chloride, sodium hydroxide and \nanhydrous sodium sulfate) were purchased from Merck, \nAldrich, Fluka and Acros (analytical reagent grades) and \nwere used as provided. The UV-Vis spectra were recorded \non a Shimadzu UV-1700 spectrophotometer. The IR spectra \nwere recorded on Shimadzu IR Affinity-1 and Nicolet 6700  \nspectrophotometers. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra were \nrecorded on a Bruker UltraShield spectrophotometer \noperating at 400 MHz and 100 MHz respectively.\nPreparation of samples for UV-Vis analysis\nThe solutions for UV-Vis analysis were prepared by \ndissolving 3-5 mg of sample in 5 mL of n-hexane as solvent. \nMeasures were carried out adding 4 mL of solution in 5 mL \nquartz cuvettes.\nPreparation of samples for IR analysis\nThe samples for IR analysis were applied in form of \nfilms (neat) on NaCl cells.\nPreparation of samples for RMN analysis\nThe solutions for NMR analysis were prepared by \ndissolving 20-22 mg of sample in 0.4 mL of CDCl 3 as \nsolvent (in 1 mL NMR tubes), bearing tetramethylsilane \nas internal standard. The experiments were run at ambient \ntemperature.\nCatalytic hydrogenation (hardening) of a FR3® oil sample\nRaney-Nickel (0.52 g) was washed with water (2 mL), \nthen with methanol (2 mL) and placed into the reaction \nvessel of a Parr reactor. Then sample (I) (4.98 g), methanol \nas solvent (12 mL) and a magnetic stirring bar were added \nto the reaction vessel. The reactor was hermetically sealed, \nthe hydrogen pipe was opened and the reaction was left \nstand during 70 h at ambient temperature, at 140 rpm and \n2500 KPa. After finish (monitored by IR), the reactor was \nopened, dichloromethane (20 mL) was added to dissolve \nthe product and to remove the catalyst by filtration. Finally, \nthe solvent was removed by rotary evaporation affording \na white solid corresponding to the hydrogenated product \n(4.94 g, 98% yield respect to trilinoleylglycerol).\nHydrolysis of a FR3 ® oil sample. Synthesis of the \ncorresponding free fatty acids\nSaponification of a FR3® oil sample. Synthesis of the sodium \nsoap derivative\nTo a solution of NaOH (1.84 g) in H 2O (11 mL), a \nsample of (I) (10.01 g) and ethanol (3 mL) were added. \nThe mixture was stirred at 200 rpm for 0.5 h at ambient \ntemperature and for 2 h at 80 oC. Then additional water \n(10 mL) was added to the mixture and the heating was \ncontinued for 1 h. After cooling, the solid formed was \nfiltered under vacuum and washed with water (2 × 3 mL), \nthen with hexane (2 × 3 mL) and dried at ambient for 10 h, \naffording a white solid corresponding to the sodium salt \n(soap) (9.19 g, 89% yield respect to trilinoleyglycerol).\nChemical and Spectroscopic Characterization of a Vegetable Oil used as Dielectric Coolant J. Braz. Chem. Soc.\n2294\nNeutralization of a soap sample. Synthesis of free fatty \nacids from the oil (I)\nA sample of sodium soap (1.00 g) was dissolved \nin distilled water (10 mL), and then aqueous 18% HCl \n(8 mL) was added dropwise until pH 3-4. The solid formed \nwas filtered under vacuum, washed with distilled water \n(2 × 3 mL) and dried at ambient temperature affording a \nwhite solid corresponding to the free fatty acids mixture \n(0.88 g, 95% yield).\nTransesterification reaction of unused and used FR3® oil \nsamples. Preparation of biodiesel\nThe weight of the starting materials was calculated \ntaking as reference the trilinoleylglycerol as it is the main \ncomponent of the FR3® oil. A mixture of NaOH (6.85 g) \nand methanol (6.93 mL) was dissolved in a 250 mL Beaker. \nThen, sample (I) (49.97 g) was added and the solution \nwas stirred at ambient temperature for 7.5 h. After finish, \nthe reaction was left standing during 2 h until formation \nof two phases. The upper phase corresponding to the \nbiodiesel was isolated by means of a separatory funnel, \naffording 47.19 g of product (94% isolated yield respect \nto trilinoleyglycerol). The same procedure was followed \nfor the sample (IV) (30.25 g), yielding 27.96 g of biodiesel \n(92% isolated yield).\nAccelerated aging assays for unused FR3® samples\n To carry out this experiment three samples were \nprepared: (i) Sample A. Oil (I) (100 g) was placed into a \n250 mL Beaker and stoppered with a perforated paraffin \npaper. ( ii) Sample B. A mixture of oil (I) (100 g) and \nde-ionized water (5 g) was placed into a 250 mL Beaker and \ncovered lightly with a round clock glass. (iii) Sample C. A \nmixture of oil (I) (100 g), de-ionized water (5 g) and Kraft \npaper (5 g) was placed into a 250 mL Beaker and covered \nlightly with a round clock glass.\nThen, sample A was heated at 110 oC while samples B \nand C were heated at 90 oC. All samples were heated for \na period of 360 h and the progress of the processes was \nmonitored by physical changes and by IR.\nResults and Discussion\nIt is known that the natural source of the FR3® dielectric \ncoolant used in this work correspond to soybean seeds. 4 \nAccording to the literature,5 soybean oil, and hence FR3®, \nis composed by about 15.1% of saturated fatty acids \n(mainly palmitic and stearic acids), and about 83.5% of \nunsaturated fatty acids (mainly oleic, linoleic and linolenic \nacids), see Table 1. In this sense, it should be expected that \nthe spectroscopic and physicochemical properties and the \nperformance of this oil inside of the distribution transformer \nshould be tightly related to its chemical composition.\nIf FR3® oil is composed of mainly by unsaturated fatty \nacids, it is also reasonable that its performance depends \nbasically on the stability of such acids during the use \ninside of the distribution transformer. Figure 1, shows \nthe structure of the triacylglycerol derived from linoleic \nacid, being the main component of this oil (51%), Table 1, \nwhich will be used as reference to explain some further \nproperties observed for this oil. In this sense, and according \nto Figure 1, the main spectroscopic and physicochemical \nproperties of the FR3 ® oil will be related with the C -O, \nC=O and C=C functionalities, which should be key for \nthe design of a possible spectroscopic-based technique to \nmonitor the performance of the vegetable oil inside of the \ndistribution transformer. \nOur study started with the spectroscopic analysis of an \nunused oil sample (I) along with three used oil samples \n(II), (III) and (IV), extracted from several distribution \ntransformers installed in Colombia and Brazil.\nAnalysis of the UV-Vis spectra for the oil samples (I-IV)\nThe UV-Vis spectra were performed in n-hexane \nbecause its expected absorption bands are less than 200 nm, \nbeing a saturated hydrocarbon. Absorption bands over \nTable 1.

Structure of the trilinoleylglycerol.\nGomez et al.\n2295\nV ol. 22, No. 12, 2011\n200 nm should exclusively be generated by the samples \nof the FR3® oil. Particularly, sample (I) showed four main \nabsorption bands at 236.0 [2.140], 272.0 [0.729], 282.0 \n[0.619] and 320.0 [0.074] nm respectively, (see Figure S1 \nin Supplementary Information). The values in brackets are \nreferred to the absorbances. All absorption bands are in \nagreement with π-π* and n- π* electronic transitions due \nto C=C and C=O functionalities respectively.6 Taking into \naccount that the FR3® oil is a triacylglycerols mixture rich \nin unsaturated fatty acids, the UV-Vis absorption bands also \nagrees with its structure and composition.\nSimilarly, the UV-Vis spectra of samples (II-IV) showed \nfour absorption bands as well as sample (I), see Table 2. \n(See Figure S1 for UV-Vis spectra of samples (II-IV)). \nThis finding suggests that in spite of the use time ( i.e., \n4 months, 8 months or 7 years) inside of the distribution \ntransformers, the chromophoric groups of those oil samples \nhave not suffered significantly changes and therefore their \nchemical structures apparently remain unmodified. Table 2 \nshows and compare the main absorption bands of the four \noil samples (I-IV).\nAnalysis of the IR spectra for the four oil samples (I-IV)\nThe Figure 2 shows the IR spectrum of the oil sample (I), \nwhere the main absorption bands correspond to: 3009.08 cm-1 \nassigned to (=C -H) stretching of the carbon-carbon \ndouble bonds, 2926.14 cm-1 and 2854.77 cm-1 assigned to  \n(C-H) stretching of the saturated carbon-carbon bonds, \n1746.62 cm-1 assigned to (C=O) stretching of the carbonyl \nfunctionalities, 1650.0 cm-1 assigned to (C=C) stretching \nof the carbon-carbon double bonds, 1163.13 cm-1 assigned \nto (C -O-C) stretching of the ester functionalities and \n722.37 cm-1 assigned to (C-H) out of the plane stretching \nof the saturated carbon-carbon bonds. Consequently, \nall absorption bands observed in the IR spectrum are in \nagreement with the structure of a triacylglycerol bearing \nunsaturated fatty acids in its structure.\nIt can be observed that the IR spectra of the used oil \nsamples (II-IV) are very similar to the spectrum of sample \n(I) Figure 2 and Table 3, (see Figure S2 for IR spectra of (II-\nIII)). These findings confirm that no significant structural \nchanges have been produced during the use of the FR3® oil \ninside of the three distribution transformers.\nAnalysis of the NMR spectra for the four oil samples (I-IV)\nFor the oil sample (I) the 1H NMR, 13C NMR and \nDETP-135 spectra were obtained (Figures 3 and 4 \nrespectively). Although a vegetable oil is constituted by a \ncomplex mixture of triacylglycerols, surprisingly the FR3® \noil showed relatively well defined NMR spectra. In the \n1H NMR spectrum we observed signals for CH3, CH2 and \nallylic protons of the fatty acid fragments as multiplets in the \nTable 2.

Soc.\n2296\nregion of 0.87-2.78 ppm. In the range of 4.13-5.28 ppm we \nobserved two multiplets assigned to the CH2 and CH protons \nof the glyceryl moiety and in the range of 5.33-5.41 ppm we \nobserved a broad multiplet assigned to the vinylic (=CH) \nprotons of the double bonds of the fatty acid chains.\nAs expected, in the 13C NMR spectrum numerous signals \nare seen, most of them in the range of 13.99-34.00 ppm \ncorresponding to CH 3, CH 2 and allylic carbon atoms. \nSignals at 62.08 ppm and 68.91 ppm were assigned \nto the glyceryl CH 2 and CH carbon atoms. Signals at \n127.89-130.19 ppm were assigned to the vinylic (=CH) \ncarbon atoms, while the signals at 172.75-173.16 ppm \nwere assigned to the carbonyl (C=O) carbon atoms of the \ntriester functionality. The DEPT-135 experiment confirmed \nthat only signals around 13.99-14.03 ppm, corresponds to \nthe terminal CH3 carbon atoms of the fatty acid chains.\nThe other signals below of 34.00 ppm correspond \nto CH2 carbon atoms of the same chains. The signals at \n62.08 ppm and 68.91 ppm corresponded to the CH 2 and \nCH carbon atoms of the glyceryl moiety respectively. The \nabsence of signals at 172.75-173.16 ppm confirmed the \npresence of the carbonyl (C=O) carbon atoms.\nAll of the above NMR signals are in agreement with \nthe structure of a triacylglycerol bearing unsaturated fatty \nacid chains as expected for FR3® oil. Although the FR3® oil \nshould contain antioxidant or stabilizing agents, they should \nbe present in very low concentration because they do not \naffect the appearance of the entire spectra. Comparing the \nNMR spectrum of the oil sample (I) with the NMR spectra \nthe oil samples (II-IV) (see Figure S3), it is remarkable that \nthe appearances and number of signals are very similar in all \nspectra. These findings confirm that none of the oil samples \n(II), (III) or (IV) have suffered chemical changes during the \nuse inside of the distribution transformers, as was suggested \nby their UV-Vis and IR analysis. This means that all three \nused oil samples may continue being used as dielectric \ncoolant inside of the transformers for longer times.\nAnalysis of the catalytic hydrogenation (hardening) of a \nFR3® oil sample\nThe catalytic hydrogenation (hardening)7 of the FR3® \noil sample (Figure 5), was carried out in order to establish \nTable 3.

These findings should \nbe useful for a further spectroscopic-based monitoring \nprotocol to evaluate the performance of the vegetable oil \nif reductive processes could occur inside of the distribution \ntransformer. Disappearing or shifting of such signals in \na used FR3 ® oil sample may indicate the formation of \nsuch reduction products and hence, should give valuable \ninformation about the aging degree and performance of \nthe oil inside of the transformer. After the hydrogenation \nreaction, the change in appearance, physical state and color \nof the product (Figure 5 (b)) with respect to the original oil \n(I) (Figure 5 (a)), is notable.\nAt the same time, the IR spectrum (see Figure S4) \nchanged in both form and intensities of the absorption \nbands, especially at the fingerprints region (1500-700 cm-1), \nwith respect to Figure 2 for sample (I). It is notable also, the \ndifferences between the 1H NMR spectrum of the starting \noil sample (I), Figure 3, and the hydrogenated product, \nFigure 6. The signals around 5.3 ppm corresponding to \n(=CH) protons have almost disappeared. Also, allylic \nsignals around 1.8-2.3 ppm have reduced their intensities \nand conversely the intensity of the signal at 1.24 ppm \n(saturated protons), has increased.\nThe 13C NMR and DEPT-135 spectra also agree with \nchanges resulting from the hydrogenation process. In this \ncase, the olephinic carbon atoms at 127-130 ppm (Figure 4) \nhave disappeared in Figure 7. This finding confirmed \nthat almost all C=C double bonds were hydrogenated, \nbut the hydrogenation process did not affect the carbonyl \ncarbon atoms because the signals around 172-173 ppm \nremained unchanged in the hydrogenated product. All \nabove spectra are in agreement with the structure of the \nexpected hydrogenated triacylglycerol derived from the \nFR3® oil sample.\nHydrolysis of an oil sample (I)\nThe hydrolysis of the oil sample (I) was carried out in \norder to establish the spectroscopic profile of the free fatty \nacids formed from this oil. These findings should be useful \nfor a further spectroscopic-based monitoring protocol to \nevaluate the performance of the vegetable oil if hydrolytic \nprocesses occur inside of the distribution transformer. The \nappearance of spectroscopic signals belonging to the free \nfatty acids into a used FR3® oil sample should give valuable \ninformation about the aging degree and performance of the \noil inside of the transformer.\nFigure 5.

Synthesis of a sodium \nsoap derived from FR3® oil\nAfter the saponification of the oil sample (I) was \nperformed, a doughy white solid was obtained, Scheme 1.\nBecause FR3 ® oil is obtained from soybean oil; the \nsoap formed should consist of mainly by sodium salts of \nthe unsaturated oleic, linoleic and linolenic acids. The IR \nspectrum agrees with such composition (see Figure S5). As \nreference, Scheme 1 depicts the linoleic acid sodium salt \nas reaction product; as such acid is the major constituent of \nthe soybean oil. The main differences of the IR spectrum of \nthe soap (see Figure S5), with respect to the IR spectrum \nof the starting oil sample (I) (Figure 2), are found at the \nfingerprints region (1300-500 cm -1), confirming that the \nchemical transformation effectively proceeded.\nNeutralization of a soap sample.

Differences at the fingerprints region with respect \nto sample (I) and the presence of a carboxylic broad \nCOO-H absorption band at 3560-2500 cm-1 confirmed the \nformation of this product.\nThe most relevant NMR features for the free fatty \nacid corresponded to the disappearing of the (CH -O \nand CH2-O) signals at 4.0 and 4.5 ppm (in the 1H NMR, \nsee Figure S6) and the CH signal at 68.91 ppm (in the \nDEPT-135, Figure 9). Both signals referred to the removal \nof the glyceryl moiety from the starting oil sample (I) \n(Figures 3 and 4). These findings confirmed the formation \nof the expected free fatty acid.\nTransesterification reaction of unused and used FR3® oil \nsamples. Preparation of biodiesel\nThis experiment was carried out with the unused and used \noil samples (I) and (IV) respectively, in order to evaluate their \npotential for generating biodiesel. This reaction was planned \nas a future alternative to extend the usefulness of dielectric \nvegetable oils after finishing their useful lifes inside of the \ntransformers. In this sense, treatment of an oil sample (I) with \nmethanol in the presence of NaOH at ambient temperature \nproduced the expected methyl fatty acid ester (biodiesel), \nScheme 3. The same product was efficiently obtained from \nthe used oil sample (IV).\nThe structure of the methyl ester obtained was confirmed \nfrom their IR (see Figure S7) and NMR spectra, Figures 10 \nand 11. The main differences between IR spectrum of the \nbiodiesel and the starting oil sample (I) (Figure 2) were \nfound at the fingerprints region, indicating that the reaction \nproceeded effectively.\nFigure 8.

Preparation of the free fatty acid from a sample of soap derived from FR3® oil.\nFigure 9. DEPT-135 spectrum of the free fatty acid obtained from the oil \nsample (I) (100 MHz, CDCl3 as solvent).\nGomez et al.\n2299\nV ol. 22, No. 12, 2011\nThe main features of 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra \nof the obtained biodiesel corresponded to the presence of \na new singlet at 3.67 ppm and (51.38 ppm), respectively, \nassigned to the new CH3O of the methyl ester functionality, \nand the disappearing of the signals around 4.5 and \n4.0 ppm (68.91 and 62.08 ppm) associated with the CH \nand CH 2 groups of the glyceryl moiety. These findings \nunambiguously confirmed the formation of the biodiesel \nfrom the oil samples (I) and (IV).\nAccelerated aging tests for FR3® oil samples\nTo complement the chemical and spectroscopic studies \nperformed to the four oil samples (I-IV), we decided to \nevaluate the effect of the heating, humidity, the ambient \noxygen and the Kraft paper on the chemical stability of \nthe FR3® oil, based on experiments previously reported by \nWilhelm et al.8 As mentioned in the Experimental section \nthree samples A, B and C were prepared to carry out these \nexperiments (Table 4).\nThe three oil samples A, B and C were subjected \nto thermal stress at the temperatures and conditions \ndescribed in Table 4. These experiments were aimed to \nproduce structural changes in the oil samples detectable by \nspectroscopic techniques. These results should be useful \nfor a future development of a procedure to diagnostic the \nnatural aging of the FR3 ® oil associated with thermal, \nhydrolytic or oxidative processes inside of the distribution \ntransformers.\nThe monitoring of the aging processes was carried out \nby continuous observation of the physical changes suffered \nby the samples along with analysis by IR spectroscopy \nduring the periods of time and temperatures established in \nTable 4. Figure 12 shows how the physical properties (i.e., \nviscosity and color) of the three samples changed during \nthe heating. It is interesting that the sample with major \nincreasing of its intensity of color (darkness) and viscosity \ncorresponded to sample A where neither water nor Kraft \npaper was present. As it can be seen the final texture of this \nsample was a semi-solid (gelatinous) material, Figure 12.\nContrary to the UV-Vis spectrum of the original FR3® \noil sample (I), the UV-Vis spectra of the three accelerated \naged samples showed only two but not four absorption \nbands, as shown in Figure 13 and Table 5, (see Figure S8 \nfor UV-Vis spectra of samples B and C).\nThis is an important finding because suggest that the \nchromophoric system of the oil samples has changed \nTable 4.

Also, the appearance of a \nnew broad absorption band around 3500 cm-1 is observed in \nthe spectra of the three aged samples. It is worth mentioning \nthat these above differences are greater in sample A than \nFigure 14. IR spectra of the original oil sample (I) and the accelerated aged sample A (films on NaCl cells).\nTable 5. Comparison of the absorption bands of the three accelerated \naged oil samples A-C.\nsample band 1 (lmax/Abs) band 2 (lmax/Abs)\nA 239/3.436 272/1.561\nB 231/0.858 273/0.267\nC 232/1.126 274/0.310\nthe others B and C samples, Figure 14, (see Figure S9 for \nIR spectra of samples B and C).\nThe main differences between the 1H NMR, 13C NMR \nand DEPT-135 spectra of the original oil sample (I) and \nthose of the accelerated aged samples were found for the \nsample A. Figure 15 shows the relative diminishing of the \nintensity of the 1H NMR signals at the vinylic and allylic \nregions (i.e., 5.0-5.5 ppm and 1.5-2.8 ppm respectively) \nfor the same concentrations. Similarly, the relative \nintensities of the same 13C NMR signals also diminished \nwith respect to sample (I) (see Figure S10). The NMR \nspectra of the aged oil samples B and C, also exhibited \ndiminishing in the intensities of their signals, but to lesser \ndegree than sample A,  (see Figures S11, S12 for NMR \nspectra of samples B and C). Aged oil samples B and C \nstayed liquid after the heating while sample A turned into \na semi-solid material. According to these results it seems \nthat the presence of humidity in samples B and C reduced \nthe speed of the structural changing of such oil samples, \nGomez et al.\n2301\nV ol. 22, No. 12, 2011\nScheme 4. Possible hydroxylated degradation products derived from the FR3® oil samples during the aging experiments.\nalthough the products formed are of the same nature as \nthose of sample A.\nIn the case of the IR spectra of the accelerated aged \nFR3® oil samples A, B and C the small broad band around \n3400 cm-1 might be associated with hydrolytic processes by \nformation of the OH functionality or by generation of small \nfractions of free fatty acids during the aging, Scheme 4. \nThe first case would be associated with radical mediated \nprocesses involving addition of oxygen and migration of \nhydrogen atoms (species 1, Scheme 4),9 while the second \none should involve a typical hydrolysis of triacylglycerols.7 \nThe absence of water reduces the probability of this second \nprocess in sample A. Nevertheless, both processes should \naffect dramatically the physicochemical and dielectric \nproperties of the vegetable FR3® oil sample.\nAn additional process which should be responsible \nfor the increasing viscosity of the aged FR3 ® oil samples \n(mainly sample A), is associated with the formation of \nhigh molecular-weight oxidation products generated by \nthe presence of oxygen in the reaction media, Scheme 5. \nFormation of such products should be associated with the \ndrying oils concept. 7,10 The high content of unsaturated \nfatty acids in FR3 ® oil agrees with this concept. In these \nFigure 15. Comparison of the 1H NMR spectrum of the oil sample (I) (up) \nwith the spectrum of the accelerated aged oil sample A (down) (400 MHz, \nCDCl3 as solvent).\nprocesses oligomeric or even polymeric structures may \nbe formed through free radical species, Scheme 5. The \noxidation pathway starts by the abstraction of allylic or \nbis-allylic hydrogen atoms mediated by oxygen through \nperoxide radicals, (species 2, Scheme 5).11,12 Transformation \nof these peroxide radicals generally involves competitive \nreactions such as formation of cyclic peroxides (species 3, \nScheme 5), isomerization of the double bonds or even \nformation of dimers, oligomers and polymers (species 6, \nScheme 5). According to our experimental conditions, \nthis latter process should be the favored one, yielding the \nsemi-solid material in sample A. Such material should be \ngenerated by a high degree of crosslinking through the \nC=C double bonds with the formation of numerous C -C \nand C-O-C new bonds, as shown in Scheme 5. The profiles \nof the IR and NMR spectra of the aged samples A, B and \nC, are more likely with a triacylglycerol nature than a free \nfatty acid. This finding indicates that oxidation processes \n(conducting to crosslinked triacylglycerols, Schemes 5 \nand 6) prevailed over hydrolytic processes (conducting to \nfree fatty acids, Scheme 4), during the accelerated aging \nexperiments of the three oil samples (A-C).\nThe fact that sample A was the most affected by the air \nand the heating in the accelerated aging experiments is in \nagreement with an oxypolymerization type mechanism as \ndepicted in Scheme 5. Because this mechanism is mediated \nby oxygen- and carbon-based free radicals, the presence \nof water in the media (samples B and C), should decrease \nthe speed of formation of those species. 13 For that reason \nprocesses B and C proceeded slower than process A, where \nno water was present. Apparently the presence or absence \nof Kraft paper in the media did not affect significantly the \naging rate of the oil samples.\nThis mechanistic proposal also may explain the \nformation of the hydroxylated products 1 as suggested in \nScheme 4 and detected by the IR spectra. In this sense, \nformation of the di-radical species 4 may be accompanied \nby a hydrogen transfer process giving the hydroxylated \nChemical and Spectroscopic Characterization of a Vegetable Oil used as Dielectric Coolant J.

A complete UV-Vis, IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR \nand DEPT spectroscopic analysis was carried out to an \nunused vegetable FR3 ® dielectric coolant oil sample (I) \nin order to establish its structural properties. The same \nspectroscopic analysis was performed for three used FR3® \noil samples (i.e., 4 months old (II), 8 months old (III) and 7 \nyears old (IV)), obtained from several operating distribution \ntransformers. Comparison of the spectroscopic data of both \nunused and used oil samples indicated that no significant \nspectroscopic, and hence, no structural changes occurred \nafter months or years of use, indicating that the performance \nof the FR3 ® oil tested continues to be acceptable even \nafter 7 years of being in use inside of the transformers, \n(sample IV).\nChemical transformations like catalytic hydrogenation \n(hardening) and hydrolysis were also performed for \nsome oil samples and their products were analyzed by \nspectroscopic methods in order to collect additional \nstructural information about the vegetable FR3 ® oil. \nThermal and air exposed degradation through accelerated \naging tests in laboratory was also performed for three \nFR3® oil samples at 90  oC and 110 oC. The effect of the \npresence or absence of water and Kraft insulating paper was \nevaluated, showing that the sample with absence of water \nand Kraft paper had the higher increase of viscosity and \ndegradation. Spectroscopic analysis of that aged material \nsuggested the formation of highly crosslinked products \ninvolving the majority of C=C double bonds of the fatty \nacid chains mediated by free radicals oxypolymerization \ntype processes. The spectroscopic study of the oil samples \nalong with their transformation products gave valuable \ninformation to search for the aforementioned monitoring \nprocedure.\nTransesterification experiments were performed with \nthe unused and the 7 years of use oil samples (I) and \n(IV) respectively, in order to evaluate their suitability for \ngenerating biodiesel. In both cases the reactions proceeded \nGomez et al.\n2303\nV ol. 22, No. 12, 2011\nefficiently and products were obtained in good yields. \nThese findings are remarkable because they may become \nin the future a useful alternative to give added value to the \nvegetable dielectric oil residues.\nSupplementary Information\nSupplementary data are available free of charge at  \nhttp://jbcs.sbq.org.br as PDF file.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors wish to credit COLCIENCIAS, Empresas \nPúblicas de Medellín (EPM) and Universidad del Valle \nfor financial support.
