I NTRODUCTION\nG\nIVEN natural language queries, a visual grounding task\naims to localize objects or regions in images or videos,\nwhich is an important task in the vision-language research\nﬁeld. It was originated by localizing objects in an image\nbased on short descriptions or sentences [1], [2] (Fig. 1(a)).\nWith the progress on video understanding, recent efforts have\nbeen made on referring expression in videos, such as temporal\nvideo grounding. Taking Fig. 1(b) for an example, this video\ngrounding task aims to localize a video segment corresponding\nto the given language query.\nSeveral existing tasks are relevant to the newly proposed\nHC-STVG task from the task perspective, but they have a\ndifferent focus. Speciﬁcally, Referring Expression aims to\nspatially localize the target object in an image and outputs a\nbounding box.

Compared with these two\ntasks, the HC-STVG task aims to localize the spatio-temporal\ntube of the target person described in the textual query, which\nis more challenging as it requires localization both spatially\nand temporally. For example, the target person may appear in\nthe video for a long time, but the interval of the event matching\nthe description may be short. It is necessary to utilize both the\ntextual cues (such as actions and relations with other objects)\nindicated in the query sentence and the visual cues shown in\nthe video to determine the temporal boundaries. Furthermore,\ncompared to the STVG task, we only consider humans as\nour referent. This is out of two considerations. First, humans\nare speciﬁc and always the focus of all species in the videos.\nSecond, humans produce a wealth of action information and\ninteract with other people or things. Therefore, the HC-STVG\ntask requires a model to do ﬁne-grained reasoning, which is\nmore challenging but have more practical applications in the\nreal world.\nGrounding in both space and time domain is often required\nin real-world scenarios, especially for healthcare and security\nrelated applications, where the surveillance videos can be\nextremely long, but people only care about a speciﬁc person\nand his/her speciﬁc behaviors. For example, in a 24-hours\nmonitoring video, a healthcare doctor at the nursing home may\nwant to see how a particular older person was having his/her\nlunch, or a police ofﬁcer may need to search for a suspect\nfrom the crowded people and locate the process when the\nsuspect conducts a crime. In both cases, when the description\nis provided, the expected outputs are a sequence of bounding\nboxes related to the target person in the consecutive frames\ncorresponding to the described action, i.e., a spatio-temporal\ntube. Unfortunately, such a video grounding setting has not\nbeen explored yet. Hence the existing methods cannot well\nhandle this task.\nIn this work, we introduce a new task named Human-centric\nSpatio-Temporal Video Grounding (HC-STVG), which aims\nto localize a spatio-temporal tube of the target person in an\nuntrimmed video given a query description. As shown in Fig.\n1(c), based on the description ‘The woman in a white apron\ncomes to the table and puts the tray in her hands on the\ntable’, an HC-STVG model needs to answer: which person\nis the target and which frames correspond to the described\nactions. To the best of our knowledge, it is the ﬁrst video\ngrounding task centered on humans. There are three key\nchallenges in our HC-STVG task: 1) It requires grounding\narXiv:2011.05049v2  [cs.CV]  2 Jun 2021\nIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS FOR VIDEO TECHNOLOGY 2\nFig. 1. Comparison of different visual grounding tasks. (a) Referring expression in images (e.g., [1], [2]) is a task of localizing objects/regions in images\nbased on a given query. (b) Temporal video grounding aims at localizing the starting and ending frame corresponding to the described action(s) (e.g., [3], [4]).\n(c) Human-centric Spatio-temporal Video Grounding is our newly proposed task, which outputs both spatial and temporal localization. The example is from\nour newly collected HC-STVG dataset. Each example includes a video clip and a corresponding description (top), spatial annotation (i.e., the green boxes),\nand temporal annotations (i.e., the blue bottom line).\nreferring expressions both spatially and temporally at the same\ntime. 2) Multi-modality information, such as visual/textural\nattributes and actions, is often required for localizing a speciﬁc\nperson, especially in a complex multi-person scene. 3) It can\nbe difﬁcult to determine the starting and ending frame of an\naction due to its dynamic nature. This task is meaningful as it\ninvolves cross-modality modeling and ﬁne-grained reasoning.\nTo effectively deal with this task, we propose a new base-\nline method, termed Spatio-Temporal Grounding with Visual\nTransformers (STGVT), in which we jointly exploit multi-\nmodality information from videos and textural descriptions by\nusing a visual Transformer. Speciﬁcally, our STGVT method\nconsists of four steps: After generating tube proposals from a\nvideo by linking bounding boxes in consecutive frames, our\nmethod learns the cross-modality interaction between the tube\nproposals and the query sentence via a Visual Transformer,\nwhich is then followed by predicting the matching tube and\ntrimming the irrelevant frames. Although there are many\nvision-language datasets for the visual grounding tasks, none\ncan support this new task. To address the issue, we contribute\nan HC-STVG dataset. Precisely, it consists of 5,660 video-\nquery pairs, where 57.2% of scenes have more than three peo-\nple. Each query is a sentence with an average of 17.25 words,\nconsisting of rich expressions related to actions and human-\nobject interaction. Based on this new benchmark dataset, we\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our baseline method for the\nnewly proposed HC-STVG task.\nTo summary up, the contributions of this work are\nthree-fold: 1) We introduce a novel and challenging task,\ni.e., Human-centric Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding (HC-\nSTVG), which for the ﬁrst time, focuses on humans in spatio-\ntemporal video grounding. 2) We build the ﬁrst human-centric\nvideo-description dataset, which can be used as the benchmark\ndataset for the new task and inspires the subsequent research.\n3) We propose an effective baseline method for the new task\nand demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method\nthrough extensive experiments.\nII. RELATED WORK\nA. Referring Expression in Images/Videos\nReferring Expression aims to localize the visual object\ndescribed by any natural language expression [1], [2], [6]–\n[12]. The previous works [6] and [11] used a pretrained object\ndetection network or an unsupervised method to generate ob-\nject proposals and then match these regions with the textual de-\nscription to select the most relevant proposal. To better capture\nmulti-modality context information, MAttNet [11] proposed\nto decompose the referring expression into subject, location,\nand relation. Moreover, cross-modality correlation ﬁltering is\nadopted for the referring expression task in real-time [12].\nAs for referring expression in videos, the WSSTG [13] is\nproposed to localize the spatial-temporal tube of an object\nin a trimmed video where the target objects exist through the\nwhole clip.\nB. Visual Transformer\nIn recent years, Visual Transformer methods [14]–[20] have\nachieved impressive performance in many Vision-Language\nIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS FOR VIDEO TECHNOLOGY 3\nFig. 2. Examples of our newly collected HC-STVG dataset. (a) For a video clip, we collect its text description (top), bounding boxes (green boxes), and\ntemporal annotation (bottom). (b) An example of our semi-automatic annotation strategy. For each video clip, the volunteers are asked to annotate the yellow\nbounding boxes in three selected keyframes, while the green bounding boxes in the remaining frames are tracked by the method SiamPRN [5].\ntasks, including the Referring Expression tasks. These works\nusually employed a transformer-structure model to extract\nmulti-modal feature representation from image-text or video-\ntext pairs and then predict the regions of interest(ROI) based\non the cross-modal features. The existing transformer-based\nmethods proposed for vision-language tasks can be divided\ninto two categories, the single-stream models and the two-\nstream models. The single-stream models [14]–[18] employ\na single transformer to learn cross-modal features from the\nvisual and the textual modalities. In contrast, the two-stream\nmodels [19], [20] use different encoders to encode information\nof different modalities while using a co-attention module to\nlearn cross-modal feature representation.\nC. Temporal Video Grounding\nThe goal of temporal video grounding is localizing the most\nrelevant video segment given a query sentence. The previous\nworks [3], [4], [21]–[23] used a temporal sliding-window-\nbased approach over the video frames to generate temporal\ncandidates and choose the most relevant one as the output.\nChen et al. [24] proposed aggregating the ﬁne-grained frame-\nby-word interaction between videos and queries. Xu et al.\n[23] and Chen et al. [25] proposed to generate query-speciﬁc\nproposals as candidate segments by directly integrating sen-\ntence information with each ﬁne-grained video clip. Ge et\nal. [26] explored activity concepts in both videos and queries\nfor temporal localization. Zhang et al. [27] iteratively adjusted\nthe structured graph to deal with the semantic misalignment\nproblem. Yuan et al. [28] utilized the Graph Convolutional\nNetwork [29] to model the relations between different video\nclips and proposed a temporal conditioned pointer network\nto screen the answer. Unlike these previous video grounding\nworks, which only deal with temporal localization, the newly\nproposed HC-STVG tackles spatial localization and temporal\nlocalization simultaneously.\nIII. HC-STVG BENCHMARK\nThe newly proposed HC-STVG task aims to localize the\ntarget person spatio-temporally in an untrimmed video. For\nthis task, we collect a new benchmark dataset with spatio-\ntemporal annotations related to the target persons in complex\nmulti-person scenes, together with full interaction and rich\naction information.\nA. Task Formulation\nIn this work, the HC-STVG task is deﬁned as follows.\nGiven an untrimmed video vϵV and a natural language de-\nscription sϵS , which describes a sequence of actions related to\na speciﬁc person in v, we aim to generate the spatio-temporal\ntube T (i.e., a sequence of bounding boxes) corresponding to\nthe target person. Speciﬁcally, the system needs to locate the\nsegment by determining the starting and ending frames ( l, r)\nand also generates the bounding boxes of the target person in\nthe located segment.\nB. Overview of HC-STVG dataset\nThere are 5,660 video-sentence pairs in our newly collected\nHC-STVG dataset, including 4,500 training pairs and 1,160\ntesting pairs. The average temporal duration of the ground-\ntruth tubes is 5.37 seconds while each sentence has an average\nIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS FOR VIDEO TECHNOLOGY 4\nof 17.25 words. The duration of videos is further normalized\nto 20 seconds. We ensure that the test samples and the training\nsamples do not originate from the same raw video.\nThe key characteristics of our HC-STVG are summarized\nas follows: (1) human-centric. The dataset contains precise\nspatio-temporal annotations and textual description for the\nperson of interest in each video. (2) All videos are captured\nin complex multi-person scenes, along which 57.2% of the\nvideos have more than three people while the rest videos have\ntwo persons. (3) All sentences have rich descriptions related to\nthe interaction between human-human or human-objects and\n56.1% of the descriptions include both types of interaction.\nFigure 2(a) and Fig. 3 show several examples of our newly\ncollected dataset. As demonstrated in these two ﬁgures, the\nvideos in the new dataset are captured in multi-person scenes.\nBesides, the descriptions have rich expressions related to\nactions and relations.\nC. Dataset Construction\nThe whole process includes ﬁve modules: Raw Video Prepa-\nration, Video Span Selection, Video Description, Bounding\nbox annotation, and Video Span Extension. We explain these\nparts in detail.\nRaw Video Preparation We use raw video ﬁltered by\nA V A dataset [30]. These original videos have been collected\non Youtube and have been carefully selected to ensure the\ndiversity and high-quality of the videos. These videos contain\na lot of realistic scenes, character actions, and character\ninteractions. Therefore, we can produce more suitable video-\ndescription pairs from the videos.\nVideo Span Selection Annotators watch untrimmed videos\nsequentially and follow several rules to mark suitable describ-\nable spans. To be speciﬁc, the chosen spans must be multi-\nperson scenes, thus increasing the difﬁculty of grounding in\nour dataset. Shot switching is not allowed in the annotated\nclips because shot switching splits the video content into\ndiscrete paragraphs, bringing semantic incoherence. And We\nlimit the shortest video span time to 3s to avoid annotators\nonly tagging the instantaneous actions of the characters in-\nstead of continuous action sequences. Under these restrictions,\nannotators annotate the precise temporal segment of the target\nperson’s actions in the scenario.\nVideo Description The annotator who decides the speciﬁc\nvideo span is required to write down a description of the target\nperson. To collect more diversiﬁed and natural expressions,\nwe do not provide any templates and predeﬁned verb lists\nfor annotators to follow. But we still have some guidelines\nfor annotators to make an appropriate textual annotation. (1)\nThe description can spatio-temporally locate the target person\nuniquely, which means that there can not exist another person\nthat satisﬁes the description and the actions of the target person\nare traceable. (2) We encourage annotators to describe in terms\nof explicit visual attributes, human actions, and relations, as\nour goal is to contain a variety of reasoning information.\nAnd descriptions of other persons’ attributes in the sentence\nare also encouraged to increase diversity. (3) As for actions\ndescriptions, in addition to using some transitive verbs (e.g.\nwalk, turn) for target persons, workers are encouraged to write\nhuman-to-human and human-to-object interactions (e.g. hug,\nfollow) as much as possible, which urges the algorithm to pay\nclose attention to the identiﬁcation and alignment of dynamic\nvisual relation. (4) The annotators are encouraged to label\nsuccessive events that consist of the target character and related\nactions, which increases the number of verbs in the sentence\nand differs HC-STVG from the mere action localization task.\n(5) Since we only deal with the video images, the annotators\nare required to focus on the visual content rather than the\nsound content. At last, after the annotations, we manually\nreview the descriptions to ensure label quality.\nBounding Box Annotation Frame-level bounding box an-\nnotation is quite crucial for visual grounding tasks to assist\nin the judgment of location correctness. However, manually\nlabeling bounding boxes for each frame in the video may\nlead to enormous labor pressure. To trade off this problem,\nwe adopt the way of manually labeling keyframes and auto-\nmatically labeling other frames with the tracking algorithm.\nConcretely, we use SiamRPN [5] to track the target person.\nWe manually annotate three keyframes of a video span (i.e.,\nstarting, middle, ending frame) and track the other frames,\nwhich effectively outperforms using only one keyframe. We\ntrack the person in the annotated temporal clip from front to\nback and from back to front using keyframes, then we average\nthese two tracking results as an annotation. We conduct an\nadditional manual review to correct the tube for samples with\napparent differences in two direction tracking results.\nVideo Span Extension After the video spans are collected\nand the spatial-temporal annotations are complete, we extend\nthe video clips forward and backward on the temporal ground\ntruth randomly to achieve a ﬁxed total length of time for ﬁnal\nquery videos, and the extended time also serves as a negative\nsample for temporal localization. As localizing descriptions in\nquery videos may be ambiguous after time extension, in HC-\nSTVG, additional annotators review the total video span to\nguarantee there is no unambiguous referring.\nTABLE I\nSTATISTICS OF DIFFERENT DATASETS .\nALS STANDS FOR AVERAGE LENGTH OF SENTENCES .

Comparison with the Existing Datasets\nWe compare the existing video grounding datasets with our\nnewly collected HC-STVG dataset in Table I. The DiDeMo\ndataset [4] only provides temporal annotation for the tem-\nporal localization task. The TACoS dataset [34], ActivityNet\nCaptions dataset [32], and Charades-STA dataset [3] are all\nhuman-centric datasets as their videos capture human actions\nIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS FOR VIDEO TECHNOLOGY 5\nFig. 3. An example video-sentence pair in our newly collected dataset. In the example video clip, the target person performs a series of actions. Correspondingly,\nthese actions are described in the sentence, including ‘puts his glasses on the table’,‘pulls something out of his pocket’, and ‘puts it on the table’.\n(e.g., cooking). Similar to DiDeMo dataset, these datasets\nare collected for the temporal localization task, and they\ndo not have annotations at the bounding box level. The\nVID-sentence dataset [13] provides the bounding-box-level\nannotations. However, it only focuses on spatial localization.\nVideo clips in this dataset are all trimmed, hence it is not\nsuitable for temporal localization. Among all datasets, the most\nrelevant dataset is the VidSTG dataset [33]. It is extended\nfrom the dataset Vidor [35], which is a dataset originally\ncollected for detecting relations in videos. The VidSTG dataset\nprovides both bounding-box-level annotations and temporal\nannotations. However, this dataset focuses on the task of\nrelation referring between subjects and objects. In contrast,\nour HC-STVG dataset focuses on localizing the target person\nspatially and temporally from multi-person scenes based on the\nquery sentences. Furthermore, on average the length of each\nsentence in our dataset is the longest among these datasets,\nand the descriptions from this dataset contain rich expressions\nrelated to actions and human-object interaction. The details of\nall these datasets are summarized in Table I.\nIV. METHODOLOGY\nThe overall framework of our STGVT method is shown in\nFig. 4. Given a video v and a query sentence s depicting a\nperson performing a series of actions, our STGVT method\naims to output a spatio-temporal tube T corresponding to\nthe description. The method consists of four steps: 1) it ﬁrst\ngenerates the tube proposals (Sec. IV-A). 2) Then a visual\ntransformer takes a pair of the tube proposal and the query\nsentence as the input, and extracts the cross-modal features,\nincluding the global feature and the frame features (Sec. IV-B).\n3) A matching classiﬁer is adopted to predict a matching score\nfor each tube-sentence pair. The tube proposal with the highest\nmatching score will be proceeded in the ﬁnal step (Sec. IV-C).\n4) Based on the selected tube, a temporal trimming module is\nproposed to trim the irrelevant frames and produce the ﬁnal\nspatio-temporal localization results. (Sec. IV-D).\nIn this section, we ﬁrst describe each step of the proposed\nmethod and then introduce the loss functions (Sec. IV-E) and\nthe inference process (Sec. IV-F).\nA. Tube Proposals Generation\nGiven a video, we ﬁrst use the region proposal network [36]\nto detect the bounding boxes Bt,i in each frame, where Bt,i\nrepresents the i-th bounding box in the t-th frame. Basically,\nwe follow the ACT method [37] to link the bounding boxes in\nconsecutive frames to form spatio-temporal tube proposals Tp.\nThis process is essential to group the bounding boxes contain-\nIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS FOR VIDEO TECHNOLOGY 6\nSeg.\nSeg.\nSeg.\nSeg.\nSeg.\n1\n 2\n 3\n 14\n 15\n[CLS]\nThe\nman\nturns\naway\nSeg.\n16\n[SEP]+ + + + + +\n+ + + + + +\nQuery:The man in the vest puts the plate on thetable and turns away\nSegmentEmbedding\nPosition Embedding\n𝐵𝑜𝑥$\n 𝐵𝑜𝑥%\n 𝐵𝑜𝑥&\n 𝐵𝑜𝑥'\n1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n+ + + +\nROIFeature\nLocationEmbedding\nPositionEmbedding\n𝐵𝑜𝑥$(\n𝐵𝑜𝑥$$\n10\n 11+ +\n+ + + + + +\nVisual Transformer\nGlobal Feature\nDetection&Linking\nMatchingScore\n Classification ScoreTube OffsetsClassification ScoreTube Offsets\nFrame FeatureFrame Feature\n(768D) (1024D)\n(1024D)\n(1024D)(768D)\n(768D)\n(1024D) (1024D)(1024D)\nA.\tTubeProposalsGeneration\nB.\tCross-modal\tRepresentation\nC.\tTube-description\tMatchingD.\tTube\tTrimming\nTokenEmbedding\nFig. 4. The framework of our STGVT. The framework has four modules, which correspond to four steps explained in Methodology. Speciﬁcally, given a\nquery sentence and video, it ﬁrst generates tube proposals (A), and then each tube-description pair is fed into the visual transformer (B). The output feature\nof the visual transformer is used for predicting matching score, classiﬁcation score, tube offsets , which to be used for tube selection (C) and tube trimming\n(D).\ning similar visual content in adjacent frames. Different from\nthe method [37], we compute the similarity score between two\nbounding boxes (i.e., Bt,i and Bt+1,j) as follow:\nS(Bt,i,Bt+1,j) =λi ∗IoU(Bt,i,Bt+1,j)\n+λc ∗Dcosine(f(Bt,i),f(Bt+1,j))\n+φ(Bt,i) +φ(Bt+1,j),\n(1)\nwhere f(·) is a pretrained feature extractor, Dcosine(·,·) is\nthe cosine function, φis the conﬁdence score of the bounding\nboxes, and λi,λc are the weights of the IoU score and\nthe cosine score. In practice, we set them as 0.7 and 0.3\nrespectively.\nB. Cross-modal Representation\nThe next step is to extract cross-modal features for each\npair of the tube proposal Tp and the query description s.\nWe adopt Visual Transformer in this step due to its great\nsuccess for the cross-modal tasks [19]. The visual transformer\ntakes the visual and textual inputs separately and models\ntheir interaction through a set of transformer layers based on\nthe co-attention mechanism. Speciﬁcally, following [38], we\nuse the position information, token information, and segment\nembedding extracted from the query description s as the\ntextual inputs; while each temporal position, visual feature,\nand spatial location from tube proposal Tp are used as the\nvisual inputs for each tube proposal Tp. The temporal position\nrefers to the frame index, the visual features are extracted from\nthe bounding box in each frame ofTp, and the bounding boxes’\ncoordinates are encoded as the location embedding.\nThe visual transformer will output two cross-modal features\nfglobal and fframe . When using the textual inputs as the\nQuery and the visual inputs as the Key and Value, fglobal\np\n(p indicates the p-th tube-sentence pair) is the element-wise\nproduct of the visual feature and textual feature, which are\nextracted from the ﬁrst token position. When the visual inputs\nare used as Query and the textual inputs are used as Key\nand Value, the model generates the feature fframe\np,t for each\nbounding box in each frame of Tp (p and t refer to the t-th\nframe of the p-th tube). These two features are used to predict\nthe matching scores of Tp at the tube-level and the frame-level,\nwhich to be explained below.\nC. Tube-description Matching\nIn this step, our method will verify if the input tube proposal\nTp is matching with the query description s. As mentioned\nabove, the visual transformer extracts the global feature fglobal\np\nfor each pair of Tp and s. We feed fglobal\np into a binary\nclassiﬁer to predict its matching score M′\np ∈[0,1]. Tp with\nthe highest matching score will be selected and fed into the\nlast step.\nWhen training the classiﬁer, it is worth noting that the\npositive and negative samples can be imbalanced if we only\ntreat the ground-truth tube, TGT , as the positive sample. To\ntackle this problem, we relax the criteria for the positive\nsamples by introducing two scores, soverlap and sIoU . The\ntube proposals which simultaneously satisfy the following two\nconditions, soverlap >= 0.9 and sIoU >0.5, are treated as the\npositive samples. Speciﬁcally, (1) soverlap is deﬁned as follow:\nIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS FOR VIDEO TECHNOLOGY 7\nsoverlap = |Tp ∩TGT |\n|TGT | , (2)\n|TGT |refers to the total number of frames in the ground-truth\ntube. This score reﬂects the ratio of the total number of the\nintersected frames between Tp and TGT over all frames in\nTGT. 2) The average IoU score sIoU is deﬁned as follow:\nsIoU = 1\n|Tp ∩TGT |\n∑\nt∈Tp∩TGT\nIoU (B′\nt,Bt), (3)\nwhere B′\nt and Bt are the detected/ground-truth bounding boxes\nof Tp and TGT at frame t, respectively. A tube is treated as a\nnegative sample when its sIoU is lower than 0.2.\nD. Tube Trimming\nGiven the dynamic characteristics of actions, the selected\ntube proposal Tp may contain redundant transition frames.\nHence it is required to trim Tp to output the ﬁnal predicted\ntube T. We compute the relevance score of each frame in Tp to\nthe query s, and predict the regression offsets. Our trimming\nmodule consists of two subnets, a classiﬁcation subnet and a\nboundary regression subnet, which will be detailed below.\n1) Classiﬁcation Subnet\nThe classiﬁcation subset is used to predict if a video\nframe should be kept in the ﬁnal tube – the spatio-temporal\nlocalization result T, or not. As introduced in Sec. IV-B,\nthe transformer outputs fframe\np,t for each frame of Tp. The\nclassiﬁer takes fframe\np,t as the input to predict a relevance score\nC′\np,t indicating how relevant the t-th frame is to the query\nsentence s.\n2) Boundary Regression Subnet\nBesides the relevance score C′\np,t, we also adopt a network\nto predict the temporal offsets, which reﬂects how far away the\ncurrent frame is from the ground-truth temporal boundary. This\nsubset’s architecture is the same as the classiﬁcation subset\nexcept that it has two outputs. Speciﬁcally, for a positive frame\nat the t-th position, if the ground-truth tube spans from the l-\nth frame to the r-th frame (i.e., RGT = [l,r]), the regression\ntarget is Op,t = (δl,δr),\nδl = t−l\nN δr = r−t\nN , (4)\nwhere N is the number of frames in tube Tp. δl and δr refer\nto the temporal offset from the t-th frame to the left and the\nright boundary, respectively.\nE. Loss Functions\nGiven the tube-level matching prediction score M′\np, the\nframe-level relevance prediction score C′\np,t, and boundary\nregression prediction result O′\np,t, and their corresponding\nground-truth labels Mp, Cp,t, Op,t, the total loss is deﬁned\nas follows,\nL=\n∑\np\n{λ1 ∗Lmatch\n(\nM′\np,Mp\n)\n+λ2 ∗I{Mp=1}\n1\nN\n∑\nt\nLcls\n(\nC′\np,t,Cp,t\n)\n+λ3 ∗I{Mp=1,Ct=1}\n1\nNpos\n∑\nt\nLreg\n(\nO′\np,t,Op,t\n)\n}\n(5)\nwhere Lmatch is the cross-entropy loss for the tube-description\nmatching module, Lcls and Lreg is a cross-entropy loss and\nIoU loss (i.e., −ln(\nO′\np,t∩Op,t\nO′\np,t∪Op,t\n)) for the classiﬁcation subset\nand the boundary regression subset, respectively. N and Npos\ndenote the number of frames and the positive frames in the\ntube Tp. It is worth noting that, except for the tube proposals\ngeneration network, the rest of the proposed modules can be\ntrained in an end-to-end fashion. However, the loss Lcls and\nLreg in Eq. 5 are only computed for the positive tubes (i.e.,\nI(Mp=1)) and positive frames ( I(Mp=1,Cp,t=1)).\nF . Inference\nDuring the inference process, given a query sentence sand\na video v, our proposed method: (1) ﬁrst generates P tube\nproposals Tp (p = 1,2,...,P ). Each tube proposal Tp and\nthe query sentence s form a pair, which will be fed into the\nvisual transformer. (2) For each pair of Tp and s, the visual\ntransformer extracts cross-modal features, fglobal\np and fframe\np,t .\n(3) The tube-description matching module takes the global\nfeature fglobal\np as the input and predicts a matching score M′\np.\nThe tube with the highest matching score M′\np is selected and\nfurther trimmed. (4) For all frames in the selected tube Tp,\nthe classiﬁcation subnet and the regression subnet take the\nframe feature fframe\np,t as the input, and output the classiﬁcation\nscore C′\np,t and O′\np,t = (δl,δr) for each frame. We follow the\nmethod DEBUG [39] to determine the temporal boundary of\nthe selected tube. Speciﬁcally, we start from the frame with\nthe highest C′\np,t. Given its predicted regression offsets O′\np,t =\n(δl,δr), we can produce an initial range Rinit = (t−δl∗N,t+\nδr ∗N). Next, we compute Rt for the remaining N−1 frames.\nIf the predicted range of the t-th frame, Rt, has overlap with\nRinit, then Rt is merged with Rinit. This process is repeated\nfor all frames whose C′\np,t higher than a pre-deﬁned threshold\nϵ, which will produce the ﬁnal predicted tube.\nV. EXPERIMENTS\nA. Evaluation Metrics & Implementation Details\nThe main evaluation metric for HC-STVG is vIoU, and it\nis deﬁned as follow:\nvIoU = 1\n|Tunion|\n∑\nt∈Tinter\nIoU (B′\nt,Bt), (6)\nwhere Tinter = Tp ∩TGT refers to the intersected frames\nbetween the predicted tube Tp and the ground-truth (GT)\ntube TGT , Tunion = Tp ∪TGT represents the union set of\nthe predicted frames and the GT frames, B′\nt and Bt are\nthe predicted bounding box and the ground truth bounding\nbox at frame t. vIoU reﬂects the accuracy of the predicted\nspatio-temporal tubes. The vIoU@perc. score stands for the\nIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS FOR VIDEO TECHNOLOGY 8\npercentage of predicted tubes whose vIoU is larger than perc.\nand mvIoU is the average of vIoUs score over the whole test\nset.\nDuring the inference process, we sample one frame from\nevery six frames of the tube before feeding the sampled frames\ninto the visual transformer in order to reduce redundancy. The\nmaximum number of bounding boxes detected in each image\nis set as 101. We use Mask R-CNN pretrained on the Visual\nGenome dataset [40] to extract the visual features from each\nbounding box. Every query sentence s is truncated or ﬁlled\nto the maximum length of 40 words. The loss weights λ1,\nλ2, λ3 are empirically set as 1, 1 and 2, respectively. During\nthe training process, we use Adam optimizer [41]. The initial\nlearning rate and batch size are empirically set as 2e-5 and\n32, respectively.\nTABLE II\nPERFORMANCE (%) OVER m vIoU , vIoU @0.3 AND vIoU @0.5 ON THE\nVIDSTG D ATASET OF THE DECLARATIVE SENTENCE .\nMethod Declarative Sentence\nm vIoU vIoU@0.3 vIoU@0.5\nRandom 0.69% 0.04% 0.01%\nGroundeR [42] + TALL [3] 9.78% 11.04% 4.09%\nSTPR [43] + TALL [3] 10.40% 12.38% 4.27%\nWSSTG + TALL [3] 11.36% 14.63% 5.91%\nGroundeR [42] + L-Net [44] 11.89% 15.32% 5.45%\nSTPR [43] + L-Net [44] 12.93% 16.27% 5.68%\nWSSTG [13] + L-Net [44] 14.45% 18.00% 7.89%\nSTGRN [33] 19.75% 25.77% 14.60%\nSTGVT 21.62% 29.80% 18.94%\nTABLE III\nPERFORMANCE (%) OF DIFFERENT METHODS ON THE HC-STVG\nDATASET IN TERM OF m vIoU , vIoU @0.3 AND vIoU @0.5\nMethod m vIoU vIoU @0.3 vIoU @0.5\nRandom 0.71% 0.03% 0%\nTALL [3]+WSSTG [13] 13.37% 19.95% 7.33%\n2D-TAN [45]+WSSTG [13] 15.43% 19.83% 6.81%\nSTGVT (w/o trimming) 16.93% 21.29% 6.64%\nSTGVT (w/o pretraining) 17.46% 25.09% 7.76%\nSTGVT 18.15% 26.81% 9.48%\nB. Baseline Methods\nConsidering that the existing methods cannot be directly\napplied for the human-centric spatio-temporal video ground-\ning task, we form two baselines by combining the existing\nmethods on video grounding. Speciﬁcally, TALL [3] and 2D-\nTAN [45] are the two methods for temporal video localiza-\ntion, while WSSTG [13] method is proposed for localizing\nspatio-temporal tubes in trimmed videos. So we ﬁrst apply\nTALL or 2D-TAN to produce a temporary segment from each\nuntrimmed video based on each given sentence, and then\nutilize the WSSTG method to localize spatio-temporal tubes\nin the generated segment. The Random method localizes the\ntemporal segment and spatial regions randomly. It is worth\nnoting that we replaced the tube-description matching module\nwith the WSSTG method, while keeping the entire training\nprocess fully supervised. For a fair comparison, we the same\nstrategy for all these methods to generate the tube proposals,\nas introduced in Section IV-A.\nC. Experimental Results\nWe report the results of our STGVT method and the baseline\nmethods in Table III. One can observe that our STGVT method\noutperforms all baseline methods. Our method achieves the\nmvIou score of 18.15%, which outperforms baseline methods\nby a signiﬁcant margin. Our method also surpasses the base-\nlines in terms of vIoU@0.3 and vIoU@0.5.\nTo further verify the effectiveness of our method, we also\nconducted experiments on VidSTG [33] dataset. VidSTG is a\nsuitable dataset for Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding task,\nbut it is not human-centric. Thus we considered all the\ncategories in the library when generating tubes, and use the\nsame method to select the target tube and trim it. Experimental\nresults in Table II. show that our method is also effective on\ndifferent databases.\nD. Ablation Study\n1) Effectiveness of Tube-description Matching Module\nIn our proposed method, the tube-description matching\nmodule outputs a raw prediction of the spatio-temporal tube,\nwhich will further be trimmed by the tube trimming module.\nWe evaluate the quality of the raw predictions by comparing\nour method with the WSSTG [13] method in Table IV. It is\nworth noting that (1) we directly use the tube without any\ntemporal trimming as the ﬁnal prediction, (2) both ours and\nWSSTG use the same method for generating tube proposals.\nTABLE IV\nTUBE MATCHING ACCURACY RESULTS ON THE HC-STVG DATASET\nMethod m vIoU vIoU @0.3 vIoU @0.5\nRandom 2.40% 1.72% 0.44%\nWSSTG [13] 12.96% 16.23% 4.35%\nSTGVT 16.93% 21.29% 6.64%\n2) Effectiveness of Tube Trimming Module\nIn this section, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the\ntube trimming module in our proposed method. As shown in\nTable III, our full method ( STGVT) signiﬁcantly outperforms\nthe simpliﬁed version without the tube trimming module\n(termed as STGVT (w/o trimming)). The performance improve-\nment of our STGVT over STGVT (w/o trimming) indicates\nthe effectiveness of the tube trimming module. However, it\nis worth noting that, even without using the tube trimming\nmodule, our simpliﬁed version STGVT (w/o trimming) method\nstill achieves better performance compared with other baseline\nmethods. Besides, we compared the results of the trimmed\npositive tube, as shown in Table V, the result of tube selection\nwe chose signiﬁcantly outperforms the baseline method.\nTABLE V\nTEMPORAL GROUNDING PERFORMANCE (%) OVER m tIoU AND\nm vIoU\nMethod m vIoU m tIoU\nRandom 0.71% 10.50%\nTALL [3] +Tubepos 31.64% 44.31%\n2D-TAN [45]+Tubepos 32.89% 46.20%\nSTGVT+Tubepos 34.71% 48.64%\nIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS FOR VIDEO TECHNOLOGY 9\nFig. 5. Representative results produced by our method and the baseline method (WSSTG+TALL). In the 2nd and the 5th examples, our method achieves\nbetter temporal localization results when compared with the baseline method. While in the 1st, the 3rd, and the 5th examples, our method achieves more\naccurate spatial localization results.\nIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS FOR VIDEO TECHNOLOGY 10\n3) Effectiveness of the Pretraining Strategy\nSince we adopt the visual transformer pretrained based on\nthe Conceptual Captions dataset [46], we wonder whether the\nperformance improvement is due to the pretraining strategy.\nSo we perform another experiment by training the visual\ntransformer from scratch 2 (and our method is referred as\nSTGVT (w/o pretraining) . As shown in Table III, we observe\nthat: 1) our method STGVT (w/o pretraining) outperforms\nexisting baseline methods; 2) using the pretraining strategy\ncan improve the performance.\nE. Qualitative Analysis\nWe provide some visualization results in Fig. 5. These\nexamples show that our method outperforms the baseline\nmethod for video grounding both spatially and temporally.\nSpeciﬁcally, in most examples (except the 3rd one), there are\nmore overlap between our temporal tube prediction results\n(see the yellow line) and the ground-truth (see the green\nline) when compared with the baseline method TALL [3] +\nWSSTG [13](see the red line), which indicates our method\ncan localize the video segment more precisely. In the 3rd\nexample, both our method and the baseline method achieve\ngood performance in temporal grounding, but our method\ngenerates more accurate bounding boxes.\nVI. C ONCLUSION\nIn this work, we have introduced a novel task Human-\ncentric Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding (HC-STVG).\nFurthermore, we have contributed a new HC-STVG dataset\nwith rich spatio-temporal tube annotations for videos and the\ncorresponding descriptive sentences. We have also proposed\na baseline method named STGVT, which takes advantage\nof the Visual Transformers to tackle the HC-STVG task.\nComprehensive experiments have demonstrated that our\nmethod outperforms the existing grounding methods for the\nHC-STVG task.\nAcknowledgement: This research is supported in part by the\nNational Key Research and Development Project of China\n(No. 2018AAA0101900), the National Natural Science Foun-\ndation of China (Grant 61876177), Beijing Natural Science\nFoundation (4202034), the Guangdong Basic and Applied\nBasic Research Foundation (Grant No.2020B1515020048),\nFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities,\nZhejiang Lab (No. 2019KD0AB04).\nREFERENCES\n[1] L.
