    "abstract": "Abstract Science is a collaborative endeavor. Yet, unlike co-authorship, interactions within and across teams are seldom reported in a structured way, making them hard to study at scale. We show that Large Language Models (LLMs) can solve this problem, vastly improving the efficiency and quality of network data collection. Our approach iteratively applies filtering with few-shot learning, allowing us to identify and categorize different types of relationships from text. We compare this approach to manual annotation and fuzzy matching using a corpus of digital laboratory notebooks, examining inference quality at the level of edges (recovering a single link), labels (recovering the relationship context) and at the whole-network level (recovering local and global network properties). Large Language Models perform impressively well at each of these tasks, with edge recall rate ranging from 0.8 for the highly contextual case of recovering the task allocation structure of teams from their unstructured attribution page to 0.9 for the more explicit case of retrieving the collaboration with other teams from direct mentions, showing a 32% improvement over a fuzzy matching approach. Beyond science, the flexibility of LLMs means that our approach can be extended broadly through minor prompt revision.",
