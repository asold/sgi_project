  "abstract": "Power transformer bushings withstand great electrical and mechanical stress during high voltage and high current working conditions. Sealing failure poses a great threat to the long-term and reliable operation of the bushing and power transformer; however, the criterion to evaluate the sealing status of a bushing caused by mechanical problems is still lacking. In this paper, a transformer bushing model is established to gain theoretical insight into the relationship between temperature and pressure of a compact multilayer bushing. To evaluate the bushing mechanical status, different sealing conditions are tested based on the temperature and pressure monitoring within the physical 110 kV bushing. The results show that mechanical sealing failure can be diagnosed when the fluctuation of the oil pressure value exceeds the theoretical curve in steady state by 3 kPa. With different reliability coefficients, gas leakage and oil leakage are available to be further determined. The primary and auxiliary criteria based on oil pressure and its gradient are proposed to evaluate comprehensively the actual sealing condition of the bushing, and a wireless oil pressure module is developed at the bottom valve, which is quite beneficial to field online application. It is promising to extend the online mechanical monitoring and diagnosis to oil-immersed power equipment.",
