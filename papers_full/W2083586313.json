When PortCF underwent a change\nin vendor and an extensive redesign in\n2010, the CFF supported the development\ncosts for the platform and all customisations\nand activation fees. T o maintain the registry ,\nthe CFF pays for monthly hosting fees and\nproject management support along with the\nfees for all enhancements to the registry\nplatform.\nTimely and accurate completion of data\nentry by CF centres is incentivised by the\nprovision of monetary payments from the\nCFF that are proportional to the number\nand completeness of records entered into\nPortCF , as well as the CF team’s ability to\naccess and use the data for clinical care\nand QI work. Data reliability is also sup-\nported by automated checks at the time\nof data entry for in-range values. Manual\naudits of key variables have recently been\ninitiated as an additional quality check,\nand will be the subject of a future report.\nEVOLUTION OF THE CFFPR AND ITS\nCONTRIBUTIONS TO KNOWLEDGE OF\nTHE NATURAL HISTORY OF CF\nThe initial stated goal of the CFFPR was\nto describe the CF population in the USA\nSUPPLEMENT\nSchechter MS, et al.

Early reports of\nimproved patient mortality at centres using a compre-\nhensive treatment programme facilitated the spread of\nthis multidisciplinary and proactive approach.\n4 This\nbasic descriptive function, the documentation of the\ndistribution of basic demographic and disease\ncharacteristics such as age, gender, rates of infection\nand comorbidities, in addition to outcomes such as\nlung function, nutritional status and survival, continues\nto give the CF community a broad perspective of the\ndisease as well as ideas for new opportunities to\nimprove care for specific subgroups of patients with\nCF .\n5 An example of this type of descriptive data is\nshown in figure 1, showing the cross-sectional relation-\nship of lung function measurements with age in three\nseparate historical cohorts.3 This kind of descriptive\nreport represents the most basic use of a patient regis-\ntry, providing important insights into the characteristics\nof the overall population, and was the primary func-\ntion served by the registry in its earliest years.\nIn 1995 the collection capabilities of the CFFPR\nwere expanded and centres were asked to enter quar-\nterly measures of growth and lung function as well as\nmore detailed data on complications and treatment.\nSoon after, epidemiologists began to recognise that\nthe CFFPR offered a resource to better understand\nthe pathogenesis of CF and the opportunity to iden-\ntify risk factors that may be associated with patient-\nlevel variations in disease course and outcomes. The\nmajority of the 68 studies using CFFPR data pub-\nlished over the last 10 years have been risk factor ana-\nlyses such as the impact on disease severity of gender,\nsocioeconomic status, and acquisition of various\nmicrobial organisms in the airway .\n5–13\nTHE USE OF THE CFFPR REGISTRY AS A DRIVER\nFOR A NATIONAL QI INITIATIVE\nUnder the influence of Gerry O’Connor, PhD DSc, a\nhealth services researcher who had previously worked\nwith the Northern New England Cardiovascular\nDisease Study Group, the CFF began in the late 1990s\nto use the CFFPR to examine centre variations in prac-\ntice and outcomes. Reports to CF care providers and\neventually to the public began to showcase these varia-\ntions, and centre directors began to receive private\nreports showing their centre ’s position within the\nnational distribution (examples are given in figure 2).\n3\nThe recognition of this variation led to serious self-\nexamination by CF clinicians\n14 and was a vital stimulus\nto roll-out the CFF QI initiative (described in detail in\nanother paper in this supplement).15 The availability\nand open discussion of CFFPR data at local and\nnational meetings were needed for the culture change\nthat led the CF community to embrace QI. Initial con-\ncerns that CFFPR data was not sufficiently reliable to\nallow appropriate and valid centre comparisons led\ncare centre teams to work harder to ensure the accur-\nacy of data entry . In addition, comparisons of out-\ncomes are case-mix adjusted to account for differences\nin disease risk in populations attending different care\ncentres; this is made possible by past CFFPR analyses\nexploring the impact of sociodemographic and disease-\nspecific risk factors on disease outcome.\n11 16 17\nCase-mix adjustment also set the groundwork for\npublic transparency through reporting of CF centre\noutcomes at CF centre Family Education Days and on\nthe CFF public website, CFF .org. The public reporting\nof outcomes was a crucial step undertaken by the CFF\nin 2006, affirming its commitment to patient-centred\ncare and providing impetus to care centre teams to\nincorporate patient and family priorities into ongoing\nimprovement work. A sample of the public report is\nshown in figure 3.\nThe ability to use the CFFPR to make reliable com-\nparisons and ascertain care centres that attain the best\npatient outcomes also enabled efforts by the CFF to\nsend out benchmarking teams in order to identify\ncharacteristics of the most successful CF care centres\nand the approaches to care that lead to their success.\nA description of that programme may be found in\nanother paper in this supplement.\n18\nFigure 1 Median FEV1 per cent predicted by age for the cystic fibrosis (CF) population in 1992, 2002 and 2012.35 FEV1 decreases\nwith age, but there have been notable improvements in this metric for the registry population over the last 20 years. This is an\nexample of the initial basic function of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry, which is to provide important descriptive\ninformation regarding the CF population to stakeholders in annual reports.\nSupplement\ni10 Schechter MS, et al.

The CFFPR data also provides the ability\nto develop QI goals, to track the ongoing effect of QI\nefforts, and to provide progress reports internally to\ncare teams and externally to health system stakeholders\nand patients. This capability has facilitated presenta-\ntions at the annual North American CF conference and\nin professional journals,\n19–23 including several of those\nincluded in this supplement. As a specific example, the\nefforts at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta (CHOA) to\nimprove outcomes of hospitalisations for treatment of\npulmonary exacerbations used regular downloads of\nCFFPR data to track recovery of forced expiratory\nvolume in 1 s (FEV\n1) back to baseline,18 providing\nimportant feedback regarding the success of their\nefforts to the care teams.\nCLINIC END-USER FUNCTIONS OF THE REGISTRY:\nPORTCF\nResources that end-users can access to support the\ngoals of improving care and outcomes for CF patients\ninclude the following.\nIndividual patient reports\nOne of the most compelling benefits of the CFFPR to\nCF care providers is the value it brings during the clin-\nical encounter for both patients and providers.\n24 CF\ncentre staff can download patient reports from PortCF\nthat provide structured data on clinic visits, hospitalisa-\ntions, and longitudinal displays of microbiology , nutri-\ntional measures and lung function (figure 4). These\nreports are used by clinicians to prepare for patient\nvisits at preclinic meetings, and may also be shared with\npatients to help initiate discussions to promote disease\nself-management. They are of particular benefit to care\ncentres that are challenged by inadequate local institu-\ntional informational technology .\nCentre level reports\nPort CF has the capability to promptly and easily gen-\nerate population-based reports and aggregate data.\nThis allows the CF team to assess the consistency with\nFigure 2 Examples of annual Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry (CFFPR) reports provided to cystic fibrosis (CF) centre\ndirectors.

For more sophisti-\ncated data handling and analysis, care centres can\ndownload their dataset into data files that can be ana-\nlysed using standard statistical software packages.\nThese features allow unlimited customisation of data\ntracking and display so that the CF team may use the\nregistry to follow any process and outcome measures\nreported to CFFPR for QI efforts. As an example,\nprocess control charts showing return of FEV\n1 to\nbaseline following treatment of pulmonary exacerba-\ntions may be generated using this capability.\n18\nClinical tools\nAn additional section of the PortCF website, not dir-\nectly related to the CFFPR, provides a searchable\nrepository of over 800 documents including clinical\ntools, care guidelines, reports of all QI activities that\nhave been conducted within the care centre network,\npatient educational materials, information about the\nCFF clinician mentoring programme and ways to\naccess various CF listservs. Members of the care team\ncan access this resource and avail themselves of a host\nof materials, much of it generated and shared by clini-\ncians at other CF centres, that will help to enrich\npatient encounters and provide ideas to help generate\nnew initiatives.\nNEW AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS AND\nOPPORTUNITIES\nThe success of the CFFPR has led other countries\naround the world to develop their own CF Registries,\nleading to the possibility of international comparisons\nto be made as an extension of what are now predom-\ninantly US national benchmarking comparisons. A QI\nprogramme has been developed in Germany that uses\ntheir national registry to benchmark and then identify\neffective approaches to improve outcomes.\n25 The\npotential to discover novel approaches to optimal care\nis magnified considerably when the sharing of ideas\noccurs at an international level. An early example of\nthis, with historically significant ramifications, was a\ncomparison of nutritional outcomes and survival\nbetween the T oronto and Boston CF centres,\n26 which\nwas instrumental in convincing CF care providers\naround the world of the benefits of a more aggressive\nand proactive approach to nutrition. Comparisons\nbetween registries is complicated by differences that\nexist in data collection procedures, which must be\nidentified and reconciled in order to harmonise the\ndata. Current work with Australia and the UK\n27 28\nshows promise in allowing analysts to explore the\neffects of different care models and treatment\napproaches that are used in these countries.\nWith the recent and expected future expansion of\navailability of new medications to fight CF , there is an\nincreasing desire among clinicians and researchers to\nuse the CFFPR to document ‘real-world’ treatment\neffects,\n29–32 and for comparative effectiveness\nresearch. However, there are major potential pitfalls in\nattempting these analyses, most especially the problem\nof confounding by indication, whereby unmeasured\nindicators of disease severity influence treatment deci-\nsions; these threats to validity are an ongoing challenge\nto the use of any clinical registry, including the CFFPR,\nfor this purpose.\n32–34 Nonetheless, early attempts to\nuse the registry in this way appear to have been success-\nful.32 In the coming years as an increasing number of\ntherapies become available to treat CF , expectations are\nhigh that the CFFPR will be an important tool for\ndetermining the best treatment alternatives and combi-\nnations for clinical application.\nSUMMARY AND IMPLICATIONS\nThe CFFPR has played an essential role in the CFF\nefforts to improve quality of care and disease outcomes\nfor patients with CF . The creation of provocative dis-\nplays of centre-based variation served as an essential\nkick-start to the CFF QI programme and continues to\nprovide ongoing motivation for engaged CF clinicians\nand staff to strive towards the delivery of better care;\nfuture international comparisons promise a potential\nsharing of new ideas. With PortCF , end-user care provi-\nders and patients are provided with clinical tools to help\noptimise the function of the care team and ensure con-\nsistent delivery of evidence- and consensus-based care.\nThe CFFPR continues to fulfil its original intent, which\nwas to describe basic characteristics and survival of CF\npatients, and has also evolved into an important\nresearch tool for epidemiologists interested in the effect\nof risk factors and individual variations in CF outcomes.\nFinally , it shows great promise for future investigations\nof comparative effectiveness of established and newly\nintroduced CF treatments.\nThe experience of the CF community clearly\ndemonstrates that the study and care of a rare disease\ncan benefit from the availability of a robust disease\nregistry. In recognition of this, CF registries have been\nestablished in a number of other countries and\ndisease-specific registries have also been developed for\ntracking other rare conditions such as childhood\ncancers, complications of prematurity, inborn errors\nof metabolism, haemophilia and spina bifida.\nOverall, the CFFPR has shown itself to be a vital\nresource for understanding the clinical course and\noptimal treatment of CF , an invaluable data support\ntool assisting clinicians to deliver reliable CF care, and\nessential component of the infrastructure for promot-\ning systems-base improvement efforts across the CF\nnetwork of care centres. Its singular success is attribut-\nable to the iterative efforts of the CFF to ensure that\nthe CFFPR has evolved and grown in parallel with the\nSupplement\nSchechter MS, et al.
