  "abstract": "This article presents the original results of Polish language statistical analysis, based on the orthographic and phonemic language corpus. Phonemic language corpus for Polish was developed by using automatic grapheme-to-phoneme conversion of the source orthographic language corpus, obtained from the National Corpus of Polish (NCP). The corpus contains the most frequently used Polish words, written with the use of phonemic notation. Performed statistical analysis of Polish language based on phonemic language corpus, includes frequency of occurrence calculation of the orthographic and phonemic language components, as well as their sequence. Statistical language data, obtained as a result of performed statistical analysis, enable to develop statistical word-based and phoneme-based language models for Polish. Applying these language models can effectively contribute to efficiency improvement of automatic speech recognition for Polish.",

Both acoustic and lan-\nguagemodellingareimportantpartsofmodernstatistical\nspeech recognition approach [3, 4]. Statistical language\nmodelling enables to develop large vocabulary and effec-\ntive speech recognition systems [5]. Language modelling\ncan be used not only in speech recognition application,\nbut also in other areas of speech and language pro-\ncessing, e.g., language recognition, machine translation,\npart-of-speech tagging, parsing, handwriting recognition,\ninformationretrievalandotherapplications.\nThe main motivation of the research on speech recog-\nnition area, is to improve automatic speech recognition\nprocess,especiallyforPolishlanguage[6,7].Additionally,\nCorrespondence:pklosowski@polsl.pl\nDepartmentofElectronics,FacultyofAutomaticControl,Electronicsand\nComputerScience,SilesianUniversityofTechnology,Akademicka16,44-100\nGliwice,Poland\nresearchstudieshavebeenconductedinthefieldofprop-\nertiesofPolishphonemes[8,9],speechrecognitionbased\non it [10], speaker recognition [11, 12], speaker verifica-\ntion [13–15], and new applications of speech recognition,\ne.g.,automaticspeechtranslation[16].\nParticularly, a good performance of automatic speech\nrecognition is achieved with use of speech recognition\nby statistical methods [17]. Therefore, the main objective\nof the research presented in this paper, was to perform\nstatistical analysis of Polish language based on the ortho-\ngraphic and phonemic language corpus, for development\nof statistical word-based and phoneme-based language\nmodels, as well as applying them to improve speech\nrecognition for Polish. The developmentof statisticallan-\nguage models helps to predict a sequence of recognized\nspoken words and phonemes. The use of developed lan-\nguage models can effectively contribute to the improve-\nment of the automatic speech recognition effectiveness,\nbased on statistical methods.

It can be used particularly by linguists,\nbut also by computer scientists interested in natural lan-\nguageprocessing.\nThe NCP corpus contains over 1500 million of words.\nThe corpus is searchable by means of advanced tools,\ndeveloped by the Institute of Computer Science at the\nPolish Academy of Sciences, which analyse Polish inflec-\ntion and Polish sentence structure. The list of sources\nfor the NCP corpus, presented in Table 1, contains clas-\nsic literature, daily newspapers, specialist periodicals and\njournals, transcripts of conversations, and a variety of\nshort-livedandinternettexts[22].\nThe results of the statistical analyses, presented in this\npaper, can be considered as representative for Polish lan-\nguage as a whole which is justified to a certain extent,\nconsidering the corpus size. However, it is worth remem-\nbering that the NCP corpus is still primarily based on\nwritten texts. Spoken language transcripts constitute a\nsmaller percentage of the corpus contents which might\nbe still significant when it comes to certain specialized\ncontinuous or conversational speech recognition tasks.\nTable 2 presents the details of the orthographic language\ncorpuscontent,obtainedfromtheNCPcorpusresources.\nPhonemiclanguagecorpus\nGrapheme-to-phonemeconversion\nThe phonemic Polish language corpus contains words\nwritten with the use of phonemic notation, obtained on\nTable1 StructureoftheNCPcoprus[20]\nTypeofatextsource PercentageoftheNCPcorpussize\nDailynewspapers 50.0%\nClassicliterature 16.0%\nNon-fictionliterature 5.5%\nSpecializedperiodicalsandjournals 5.5%\nScientificandeducationaltexts 2.0%\nOtherwrittentexts 3.0%\nOtherbooks 1.0%\nTranscriptsofconversations 10.0%\nInternettexts 7.0%\nTable2 Detailsoftheorthographiclanguagecorpuscontent\nNo. Componenttype No.ofunique No.ofcomponents\ncomponents inthecorpus\n1 singlewords 1,943,462 230,301,313\n2 2-wordsequences 75,395,184 246,110,034\n3 3-wordsequences 170,180,746 246,066,692\n4 4-wordsequences 217,586,930 246,023,356\n5 5-wordsequences 232,439,967 245,980,021\nthe basis of automatic grapheme-to-phoneme conversion\nofanorthographictext.Automaticprocessingofanatural\nlanguage,veryoftenrequirestheimplementationofauto-\nmatic grapheme-to-phoneme conversion.

The rules usually are numerous with varying degrees\nof complexity. The size and complexity of grapheme-to-\nphoneme conversion rules depend on the number of let-\nters in the orthographical alphabet and the fact that each\nletter can be pronounced differently in various contexts.\nA set of grapheme-to-phoneme conversion rules for\nPolish was developed by Maria Steffen-Batóg and it\nwas presented in the monograph dedicated to the auto-\nmaticgrapheme-to-phonemeconversionoftextsinPolish\n[29, 30]. Knowledge included into these monographs was\nessential in developing implementation of the automatic\ngrapheme-to-phoneme conversion algorithm for Polish.\nAccording to Maria Steffen-Batóg, all grapheme-to-\nphoneme conversion rules, relating to one orthographic\nletter, can be stored in one table, called grapheme-to-\nphonemeconversionrulestableforoneletter.\nAccording to the grapheme-to-phoneme conversion\nrules for Polish, described in the literature [29–32],\nthe grapheme-to-phoneme conversion for Polish has\nbeen implemented in the Python programming lan-\nguage, as automatic grapheme-to-phoneme conversion\napplication namedTransFon [33]. The implementation\nincludes 975 grapheme-to-phoneme conversion rules for\n35 orthographic letters in Polish, additionally conversion\nrules for special characters and automatic grapheme-to-\nphonemeconversionalgorithm[33].Blockdiagramofthe\ngrapheme-to-phoneme conversion algorithm for a single\northographic word is presented in Fig. 1. Due to that,\nmanywordshavemultiplevariantsofthecorrectpronun-\nciation and the implementation includes only the most\ncommon basic variant of the pronunciation. Implemen-\ntation of additional pronunciation variants is planned in\nKłosowskiEURASIPJournalonAudio,Speech,andMusicProcessing  (2017) 2017:5 Page4of16\nFig.1 Blockdiagramofthegrapheme-to-phonemeconversion\nalgorithmforasingleorthographicword\nthe future. The problem of foreign words and acronyms\nphonemictranscriptionhavebeensolvedbyusingthedic-\ntionary where phonemic transcription of foreign words\nandacronymshavebeendefined.\nTransFon application was developed entirely, with-\nout adapting any existing similar tools. The developed\ngrapheme-to-phoneme conversion implementation is not\ntheonlyoneforPolishlanguage[34–38],butonlytheone\nof them is available for free use [38]. The implementation\nof grapheme-to-phoneme conversion allows to apply it\nto any task (e.g., phonemic language corpus development\nfor Polish).\nTable 4 presents the phonemic transcription examples\nin Polish, written with the use of the SPA, IPA, and\nSAMPAphoneticalphabets[25,26].\nTheTransFon applicationenablesto create the phone-\nmiclanguagecorpusonlyonthebasisoftheorthographic\nsource corpus. After automatic grapheme-to-phoneme\nconversion of the orthographic corpus with the use\nTransFon application, phonemic language corpus for\nPolish was obtained, in order to perform statistical\nanalysisofPolishlanguage.\nEvaluationofgrapheme-to-phonemeconversion\nimplementation\nThe evaluation of the automatic grapheme-to-phoneme\nconversion implementation is crucial. During implemen-\ntationofautomaticgrapheme-to-phonemeconversionfor\nPolish, it was necessary to check and to prove if it works\nproperly.\nThetestprocedureforautomaticgrapheme-to-phoneme\nconversionimplementationconsistedof:\n• Performingthetestautomaticgrapheme-to-phoneme\nconversionoforthographictextcorpusfilecontaining\nthemostfrequentlyused 1,943,462unique wordsin\nPolish,obtainedfromtheNationalCorpusofPolish\nresources[20].\n• Incaseofdoubt,validationandverificationof\nautomaticgrapheme-to-phonemeconversionresults\nforwordswiththeuseofPolish languagedictionary\navailableonline,withspecifyingcorrect\npronunciationofwordsinPolish[39].\n• Registeringcasesofincorrectautomaticgrapheme-to-\nphonemeconversion,conversionerrorsandother\nencounteredproblems.\nThe automatic phonemic transcription application was\nimplemented in such way, that the conversion algorithm\nwas stopped, if grapheme-to-phoneme conversion prob-\nlem occurred (e.g., when there was no rule allowing for\na correct phonemic transcription). This solution makes\nit easier to work on improving and developing the auto-\nmatic grapheme-to-phoneme conversion application. In\naddition, any doubts about the correct pronunciation was\nsolved with help of wiktionary.org service [39]. This solu-\ntion obviously has some serious limitations. The dictio-\nnary of wiktionary.org service contains only 61,141 Polish\nwords and only in their basic form. The verification was\nfurther complicated by other problems such as differ-\nent variants of the correct pronunciation of words or\npronunciationofforeignwordsinthecorpus.\nThe causes of problems and errors in automatic\ngrapheme-to-phoneme conversion operation were as fol-\nlows:\n• errorsintheimplementationofthe\ngrapheme-to-phonemeconversionalgorithmand\nconversionrules,\n• missinggrapheme-to-phonemeconversionrulesin\nthetables(i.e.,rulesnotincludedinthetables)for\nsomeorthographicletterscontexts,\n• grapheme-to-phonemeconversionissue offoreign\nwords,acronymsandwords,whicharenotpresentin\nPolishlanguagedictionary.\nTheaboveproblemsweresolvedinthefollowingway:\nKłosowskiEURASIPJournalonAudio,Speech,andMusicProcessing  (2017) 2017:5 Page5of16\nTable4 PhonemictranscriptionexamplesinPolish\nNo. Orthographictext Phonemictranscription Phonemictranscription Phonemictranscription\n[SPA] [IPA] [SAMPA]\n1z ˛ab [zomp] [zomp] [zomp]\n2 ´slub [´slup] [´slup] [s’lup]\n3 wkr˛ ety [fkrenty] [fkrEnty] [fkrentI]\n4b i e ˙znia [bi “ež´na] [bj EZña] [bjeZn’a]\n5 wszystkie [fšyst ´ke] [f S1stcE] [fSIstk’e]\n6 natomiast [natomi “ast] [natomjast] [natomjast]\n7 przypadku [pšypatku] [pS1patku] [pSIpatku]\n8 najbardziej [nai “bar´Zei“][ najbar>dýej] [najbardz’ej]\n9o c z y w i ´scie [o ˇcyvi´s´ce] [o >Ù1viC>tC E] [otSIvis’ts’e]\n10 powiedział [povi “e´Zau“][ povje>dýaw] [povjedz’aw]\n• Theerrorsintheimplementationofthe\ngrapheme-to-phonemeconversionalgorithmandin\nconversionrulestableshavebeencorrectedby\nmodifications,madewithinanapplicationsource\ncodeinPythonprogramminglanguage.\n• Theproblemofmissinggrapheme-to-phoneme\nconversionrulesintableshasbeensolvedbyadding\nnewconversionrulestotheexistingtables.Inorder\ntocompletethemissinggrapheme-to-phoneme\nconversionrules,newconversionruleswere\nsupplementedforthefollowingorthographicletters\n“i”,“n”,“d”,“z”,“z”,“c”,“f”,“s”,insomecontexts.\n• Theproblemsofforeignwordsandacronyms,have\nbeensolvedby usingthedictionary,wherephonemic\ntranscriptionofforeignwordsandacronymshave\nbeendefined.Asaresult,rule-basedautomatic\ngrapheme-to-phonemeconversionwas\ncomplementedbydictionary-basedautomatic\ngrapheme-to-phonemeconversionmethod.\nAnumberofimprovementsmadeitpossibletoincrease\neffectiveness of the grapheme-to-phoneme conversion\nimplementation.

Language is constantly chang-\ning, evolving, and adapting to the needs of its speakers.\nAll languages change continually, and do so in many and\nvaried ways (e.g., lexical changes, phonetic and phono-\nlogical changes, spelling changes, semantic and syntactic\nchanges) [47]. Therefore, a results of research performed\nusing different corpora may be very different from each\nother [48, 49]. The most similar results apply statisti-\ncal analysis of Polish phonemes occurrence presented in\nTable12[44,45].Theleastaccurateresultswereobtained\nwith much smaller language corpus a few decades ago\n[40–42]. Taking into account the results, available in the\nliterature, it can be concluded that performed statistical\nanalysis of Polish language, was extensive. No results of\na statistical analysis of then-phoneme sequences occur-\nrence in Polish forn > 3 were found in the literature.\nOnthebasisofthecomparisonresults,thefollowingcon-\nclusion can be drawn: The developed phonemic language\ncorpus in Polish, which was used to perform statistical\nanalysis of Polish language, was very huge, containing\n1263248497 phonemes, but not the biggest developed\nfor Polish language [44].

Alternatively, we can measure the\naverage number of possible words that follow any given\nword sequence in a language. This is the derivative mea-\nsure of entropy, known as perplexity (PP) [17].

But these\nresultscanbehelpfultodevelopadvanced(4and5-gram)\nword-based language models for Polish. As previously\nwritten, the language modelling may be based on mod-\nelling of words, as well as sub-words (e.g., phonemes).\nTherefore, the statistics of higher than three-phoneme\nsequence can be used for developing advanced (higher\nthan3-gram)phoneme-basedlanguagemodelsforPolish.\nThe advanced word-based and phoneme-based language\nmodelling, enables to develop a hybrid language mod-\nels for out-of-vocabulary (OOV) word detection in large\nvocabulary conversational speech recognition (LVCSR)\nsystems for the language [62, 63]. The language model\nin most state-of-the-art LVCSR systems is still theN-\ngram, which assigns probability to the next word based\non only theN − 1 preceding words [64]. But the use of\nan additional phoneme-based language models improves\nefficiency of LVCSR systems [65]. Another improvement\nin an LVCSR system development is the use of higher\nthan 4-gram language models, with particular emphasis\nonN-gramphoneme-basedlanguagemodels.\nConclusions\nThis paper presents the original results of statistical anal-\nysis of Polish language, performed by means of the ortho-\ngraphic language text corpus, obtained from the NCP\ncorpus and the phonemic language corpus, developed\nthrough automatic grapheme-to-phoneme conversion of\nthe orthographic language corpus. The results of statisti-\ncal analysis of Polish language, enable to develop statisti-\ncal word-based and phoneme-based language models, in\nordertobeusedforautomaticspeechrecognition.\nThe results of the research on statistical analysis of\nPolish language were compared and are consistent to\nother results available in the literature [40–46, 66, 67].\nTable18 Comparisonofperplexity PPN(Q) valuesforthe\ndevelopedphoneme-based N-gramlanguagemodelfor\nN = 1,... ,3\nN Perplexity Value Phoneme-basedlanguagemodel\n1 PP1(Q) 22.08 1-gramphoneme-basedlanguagemodel\n2 PP2(Q) 10.85 2-gramphoneme-basedlanguagemodel\n3 PP3(Q) 7.77 3-gramphoneme-basedlanguagemodel\nKłosowskiEURASIPJournalonAudio,Speech,andMusicProcessing  (2017) 2017:5 Page14of16\nTaking into account the results available in the literature,\nit can be concluded that performed statistical analysis\nof the language was extensive. No results of the statisti-\ncal analysis ofn-phoneme sequence occurrence in Polish\nfor n > 3 were found in the literature. On the basis of\nthe comparison results, the following conclusion can be\ndrawn: The phonemic language corpus in Polish which\nused to perform statistical analysis of the language, was\nvery huge (containing 1,263,248,497 phonemes) and the\nstatisticalanalysisresults,obtainedandbasedonit,allows\ntodevelopstatisticalmodelsofPolishlanguage.\nAdditionally, the validation and evaluation of the\nobtained statistical data were performed. The frequency\nof the word occurrence in a language is well described\nby Zipf’s law. The validation of statistical data for words\nwas performed by the fit of Zipf’s equation to the ranked\nfrequency distribution of Polish words. Similar regularity\nwas observed for frequency distribution of the phoneme\noccurrence for Polish language. The examination of fre-\nquency occurrence in 95 languages, presented in the lit-\nerature [51], shows that phoneme frequencies are best\ndescribed by Yule’s equation [54]. The validation of the\nstatistical data for phonemes was performed by the fit\nof Yule’s equations to the ranked frequency distribution\nof Polish phonemes and n-phoneme sequences. Accord-\ning to the results available in the literature [51], it can\nbe concluded that statistical data obtained as the result\nof performed statistical analysis of Polish language, based\non the orthographic and phonemic language corpora, are\ncorrect.\nRegularity presented in this paper, it is not an iso-\nlated case and similar regularity can be observed in other\nlanguages, so also for other language corpora, reflecting\nthe state of contemporary language [51]. It should also\nbe noted, that it seems to be valuable to provide simi-\nlar fits for existing Polish text corpora for allowing the\nreader to assess the quality of the created phonemic lan-\nguage corpus. Similarly, it seems to be very valuable to\nconfront word error rate and the perplexity of the lan-\nguage models, created by means of the existing Polish\ncorpora with respect to a common test set. However, it is\ndifficult to perform due to lack of access to other exist-\ning Polish text corpora of appropriate size and quality,\nexcept NCP corpus. Similarly, the author does not find\nanyavailablephonemiclanguagecorpusforPolish.There-\nfore, the author attempts to create his own phonemic\nlanguage corpus with the use of G2P conversion of the\nexistingavailableorthographiclanguagecorpusforPolish\n(NCP).Sincethisproblemseemstobeveryimportant,the\nauthor is planning to bring this subject up in the future\npublications.\nThe developed word-based and phoneme-based lan-\nguage models were also presented in this paper, as\nan example of practical applications of the obtained\nstatisticaldataofPolishlanguage.Theobtainedstatistical\ndata open up further opportunities to continue research\nonimprovingautomaticspeechrecognitioninPolish.The\nplan for future research includes the development of sta-\ntistical word-based and subword-based language models\nfor Polish. The word-based and subword-based language\nmodelling, enables to develop a hybrid language models\nfor out of vocabulary word detection in large vocabulary\nconversationalspeechrecognition[64,68–70].\nAcknowledgements\nThisworkwassupportedbythePolishMinistryofScienceandHigher\nEducationfundingforstatutoryactivities.\nCompetinginterests\nTheauthorsdeclarethattheyhavenocompetinginterests.\nReceived:15April2016 Accepted:8February2017\nReferences\n1.
