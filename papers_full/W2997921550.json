  "abstract": "A novel adsorbent containing chitosan (CS) and bentonite (BT) was developed by mixing, drying, and calcining, and used as an adsorbent for the efficient bleaching of deteriorating transformer oil. The effects of calcination temperature, dosage of CS, adsorbent content, adsorption temperature, and adsorption time on the bleaching capacity of transformer oil were investigated. The structure of the adsorbent was also investigated by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm techniques. The results showed that there was only physical interaction between CS and BT; CS did transform to carbon (C) and covered the surface of BT. The specific surface area and micropore volume of the adsorbent were affected by the calcination process. The composite adsorbent offered an excellent bleaching performance. When the calcination temperature was 300 °C and dosage of CS was 5%, the composite adsorbent had the optimum bleaching properties. When the composite adsorbent content was 4%, the adsorption temperature was 50 °C and the adsorption time was 75 min, the colour number and transmittance of the deteriorating transformer oil decreased from no. 10 to no. 1 and increased from 70.1% to 99.5%, respectively.",
