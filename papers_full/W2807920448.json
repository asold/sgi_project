INTRODUCTION  \nPower transformer is an important asset of utility companies \nand it directly affects the reliability, security and efficiency of \npower systems. The impact of distorted or harmonic currents \non transformers has been a concern to industry for many \nyears. For example, K-factor has been developed and widely \nused to characterize the impact [1]-[2]. Based on the \nfundamental frequency and harmonic currents passing \nthrough a location, a K-factor index can be calculated for that \nlocation. The value is then used to select a K-rated \ntransformer. This transformer is expected to operate properly \nunder the harmonic condition of that location.  \nThe K-factor index has been found useful for selecting K-\nrated transformers by owners of industrial and commercial \nfacilities. However, it cannot address at least two needs that \nare of high interest to utility companies, as explained below \n1)  K-rated transformers are not normally used by utility \ncompanies. These companies are interested in using an \noversized transformer to serve harmonic-rich feeders. On \nthe other hand, most of the available techniques other than \nK-factor are focused on de-rating a transformer to serve a \nnonlinear load, rather than providing a generic guide to \nchoose a regular but oversized transformer appropriate for \na harmonic-polluted situation. In fact, facility owners will \nalso benefit from a method that can recommend a larger \ntransformer as oppose to a K-rated transformer under \ngiven harmonic conditions. A larger but regular-designed \ntransformer could be a cheaper alternative to a K-rated \ntransformer. \n2)  Many utility transformers have been in operation for \nyears and they experience increased harmonic currents. \nUtility companies are interested in knowing if the \nharmonic currents are overloading the transformers and by \nhow much. Such information will be very useful for a \ncompany to make an informed decision on if harmonic \nmitigation measure must be taken. With the increased \npenetration of nonlinear loads in homes and residential \nfeeders [3]-[4], it has become important to utility \ncompanies to know how their distribution transformers are \naffected.   \nSeveral efforts have been made to analyze and quantify the \nharmonic effects on transformers. References [5]-[7] have \ntried to model the eddy current loss for a wide range \nincluding harmonic frequencies. The work of [8] has \nextended the loss studies to include the shell-type \ntransformers as well. Reference [9] presented a thorough \nstudy of excessive loading caused by harmonics on a \ntransformer performance for both of the dry and liquid-filled \ntypes. Moreover, works such as in [10]-[11] and [12] have \nconducted several experimental tests to measure the eddy \ncurrent loss in single phase and three phase transformers \nrespectively. In [13], the Finite Element Method (FEM) \nsimulations have also been employed to model the \ntransformer loading abilities under harmonic conditions. \nFinally, the IEEE std. C57.110 [2] can be considered as an \nultimate and comprehensive summary of all the developed \nloading assessment methods in the literature such as the K-\nfactor, harmonic loss factor (FHL) and etc. However, the \nresults are not sufficient to address the two needs explained \nearlier.  \n978-1-5386-0517-2/18/$31.00 ©2018 IEEE\n 2\nIn response to this situation, this paper introduces a new \nconcept, called equivalent lo ading, to characterize the \nharmonic impact on transformers. The basic idea is to convert \nthe impact of harmonic currents into the impact of an \nequivalent additional fundamen tal frequency current. With \nthe proposed approach, it becomes possible to quantify the \nimpact of harmonics as an increase in the 60Hz current. Thus, \nselecting a properly oversized transformer to handle harmonic \ncurrents becomes possible.  \nThe paper is organized as follows. Section II presents a \nbrief review on different types of transformer power loss and \nthe way they are influenced by harmonic currents. Section III \nintroduces new equivalent loading indices to quantify the \nimpact of distorted current on a transformer. Field \nmeasurement data are analyzed in Section IV as an example \napplication of the proposed methodology.    \nI.  B\nACKGROUND ON TRANSFORMER POWER LOSS \n The main effect of a nonlinear current on a transformer is \nthe increased power loss. The high frequency current \ncomponents cause extra power losses which may result in a \ntransformer overloading. Overheating of transformers is one \nof the main reasons for insulation ageing and consequently \ntheir loss of life [14]. Fig. 1 graphically classifies the \ndifferent power losses in a transformer. This categorization is \nbased on IEEE Std. C57.110 [2] which divides the total \ntransformer loss into no load loss (excitation loss) and load \nloss. In this section, a brief review on different types of \ntransformer loss is presented where the harmonic effect on \neach of them is discussed as well.  \nTotal \nTransformer \nLoss\nNo Load Loss\nLoad Loss\nOther Stray \nLosses\nWinding Stray \nLoss\nEddy Current Loss\nHysteresis Loss\nStray Loss\nOhmic Loss\n \nFig. 1 Classification diagram of different transformer losses \nA.  No-Load Loss \nNo-load losses can be subdivided into two main parts: the \ncore eddy current loss and hysteresis loss. The excitation \ncurrent loss also constitutes a small portion of no load losses. \nBasically, the amount of no-load loss is a function of \nlamination thickness, core mate rial and the applied voltage \nfrequency [15]. Indeed, this loss is mostly related to the \nvoltage (and its associated harmonics) applied to the \ntransformer. Harmonic currents can theoretically affect \nvoltage distortion by flowing through system impedance, but \nthe impact is generally negligible. Besides, the no-load loss \nmostly emerge at the less overheating-concerned parts of the \ntransformer such as  core and structural body rather than the \nwinding portion which involve the most concerned spots \nsubject to the risk of overloading. Consequently, the effect of \nharmonic currents on increasing the transformer no-load loss \ncan be neglected in this study [2]. \nB.  Load Loss \nLoad loss relates to the portion of power loss that is \nproduced due to the load current flowing through the \ntransformer windings. It can be divided into two main parts: \nohmic loss ( RI\n2 loss or resistive loss) and stray loss (eddy \ncurrent loss) [2]. \nOhmic part represents the well-known resistive power loss \nassociated with current flow in winding conductors and it is \nmainly affected by the conductor material, cross section and \nlength of wires in the transformer winding. Therefore, main \nfactors for determining the ohmic loss are the Root Mean \nSquare (RMS) value of current and total resistance of wires in \nthe windings. However, different frequency of each harmonic \ncomponent can slightly increase the ohmic loss by changing \nthe resistance value due to the skin effect. By neglecting the \nskin effect, ohmic power loss ( P\nC) becomes proportional to \nsquare of the total RMS current even in presence of harmonic \ndistortions:  \n∝\nh\nhC I P2  (1) \nWhere I h is the RMS of h th order harmonic current. In \nother words, the mere fact that a current is distorted does not \nitself increase ohmic loss in a transformer unless the \ndistortions have contributed to a higher current level. \nThe other part known as stray loss is due to parasitic \nelectromagnetic flux in the windings, core, core clamps, \nmagnetic shields, enclosure or tank wall of the transformer \n[2]. Therefore, it highly depends on the size and design of a \ntransformer. Stray loss, itself,  can be subdivided into two \ncomponents generally known as “winding stray loss” and \n“other stray losses”. The winding stray loss emerges from \nwinding conductor strand eddy currents as well as circulating \ncurrents between strands or parallel winding circuits [2]. The \n“other stray losses” portion, which essentially encompasses \nall the remaining parasitic losses, is mainly due to the stray \nelectromagnetic flux in transformer structural parts like core, \ncore clamp, magnetic shield enclosure and the tank walls. The \nstray flux induces eddy currents in those parts that eventually \nleads to this power loss. \nAmong different types of power loss, harmonic currents \naffect the stray loss portion the most. At each harmonic \nfrequency, the winding stray loss ( P\nEC) is approximately in \nproportion to square of harmonic frequency order ( h) and \nharmonic current (Ih) as expressed below [2]. \n∝\nh\nhEC hI P 22  (2) \nThe other stray loss (P OSL) portion is also proportional to \nsquare of harmonic current component. However its \nrelationship with harmonic order is more complicated. Based \non several experimental studies, IEEE standard suggests that \nit is relatively proportional to h\n0.8 for each harmonic \ncomponent [2]. \n 3\n∝\nh\nhOSL hI P 8 . 02  (3) \nII.  EQUIVALENT LOADING INDICES  \nIn this section, the concept of representing the impact of \nharmonic currents as the impact of an equivalent fundamental \nfrequency current is introduced. Two indices called \n‘equivalent loading index’ and ‘harmonic impact on \ntransformer loading’ are proposed. The indices are developed \nusing the same theories behind the K-factor and other \ntransformer derating methods of the IEEE Std. C57.110 [2]. \nA.  Index definition \nThe proposed concept can be explained as follows: a \ntransformer experiences X amperes of fundamental frequency \ncurrent and Y amperes of ha rmonic current. The resulting \npower loss is P\nloss. When the same transformer is supplied by \nX+ΔX amperes of fundamental frequency current only, the \npower loss also becomes Ploss. We can then consider that the \nimpact of the harmonic current is equivalent to increasing the \ntransformer fundamental frequency current from X to X+ ΔX. \nIn other words, X+ ΔX is the equivalent (60Hz) current \nexperienced by the transformer and ΔX represents the impact \nof harmonics. Since, in a sinusoidal condition, the \ntransformer power loss is proportional to the square of the \ntotal RMS current, the ratio of the transformer total load loss \nin the harmonic operation ( P\nTL) to the rated condition ( PTL-R) \ncan be employed as to derive the equivalent current index \n(I\neq): \nR TL\nTL\nR\neq\nP\nP\nI\nI\n−\n=2\n2\n (4) \nWhere IR is the transformer rated current. Consequently, the \nper-unit value of the proposed index can be determined \nthrough the following equation: \nR TL\nTL\neq\nR\neq\neq P\nPpu II\nI\npu I\n−\n== ⎯→⎯ ) () 1 () (  (5) \nAs discussed in the previous s ections, the total load loss of \na transformer consists of the ohmic power loss ( RI2), eddy \ncurrent loss (PEC) and other stray loss (POSL) as below: \nOSLEC C TLP P P P+ + =  (6) \nNow by considering the ohmic power loss at the rated \ncondition (RIR2) as the base value, PTL can be expressed in a \nper-unit form by following equations [2], \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n=\n−\n=\n=\n−\n=\n=\n=\n=\n==\n++ =\nmax\nmax\nmax\n1\n8 . 0 2\n1\n2 2\n1\n22\n) ( ) ( ) (\n) ( ) ( ) (\n) () ( ) (\n) ( ) ( ) ( ) (\nh h\nh\nhR OSLOSL\nh h\nh\nhR ECEC\nh h\nh\nhRMSC\nOSLECCTL\nh pu I pu P pu P\nh pu I pu P pu P\npu Ipu I pu P\npu P pu P pu P pu P\n (7) \nwhere Ih(pu) is the h th harmonic order of the transformer \ncurrent in per-unit form ( Ih(pu)=Ih/IR). PEC-R(pu) and P OSL-\nR(pu) are respectively the ratio of the eddy-current power loss \nand the other stray losses to the copper loss in the transformer \nrated condition (In fact, PEC-R(pu) and POSL-R(pu) are constant \ncoefficients different for each transformer, highly dependent \non transformer size and construction. They will be further \ndiscussed in the next sections). Applying (7) to the rated \nsinusoidal current operation, PTL-R can be obtained as below. \n) ( ) ( 1 ) (pu P pu P pu PR OSLR ECR TL −−− ++ =  (8) \nFinally, by substituting (7) and (8) in (5), the proposed \nindex can be derived as shown in (9). \n) ( ) ( 1\n) ( ) () ( ) ( ) (\n) (\nmaxmax\n1\n8 . 0 2\n1\n2 22\npu P pu P\nh pu I pu P h pu I pu P pu I\npu I\nR OSLR EC\nh h\nh\nhR OSL\nh h\nh\nhR ECRMS\neq\n−−\n=\n=\n−\n=\n=\n−\n++\n++\n=\n  (9) \nWhen the calculated Ieq(pu) exceeds one, the total \nproduced loss is more than the maximum permissible power \nloss and it indicates overloading of the transformer. Whereas, \nindex values less than one confirm that the transformer is \nsafely operating without being prone to overheating. To \nachieve a better understanding of the index application, an \nexample of a 100 kVA transformer supplying an 80kVA load \ncan be considered. For instance, a calculated equivalent index \nvalue of 1.1pu indicates that the transformer is 10% \noverloaded. Moreover, this in dex value reveals that the \nloading effect of this harmonic load is similar to that of a pure \nlinear load of size 1.1pu * 100kVA=110 kVA. \nBased on the above definition of equivalent loading, the \nsecond index can be directly defined as well to quantify exact \nincrease of transformer loading due to non-sinusoidal \ncharacteristic of the flowing current. We call the index \n“Harmonic Impact on Transformer Loading (HITL)” which is \ndefined as below, \n100) (\n) ( ) (\n(%) ×\n−\n= pu I\npu I pu I\nHITL\nRMS\nRMSeq\n (10) \nFor the 100kVA transformer example discussed above, \nHITL is thus 37.5% (=(110-80)/80). \nB.  Determining Transformer Parameters \nIn addition to per-unit harmonic distribution of \ntransformer current, the defined indices equivalent loading \nindices are also dependent on transformer parameters such as \nPEC-R(pu) and P OSL-R(pu). These parameters vary among \ntransformers of different size and structure. As a general \napproximate rule, they increase as the capacity of transformer \nincrease, however, two transformers of the same size can still \nhave different parameters due to dissimilar design types [2].  \nMost of the developed calculation methods for these \nparameters involve conducting complicated computation \ntasks for each individual transformer [2],[10]. Besides, such \nmethods usually require very detailed information about \ntransformer design that is generally not made available by \nmanufacturers. Most importantly, in the case of distribution \ntransformers owned by an electrical utility, the transformers \nare already installed and operated, thus, it will be even a more \n 4\ndifficult task to obtain required parameters of such \ntransformers.    \nBased on the data and analyses available in different \nreferences ([2],[5]-[13]),  an extended range of 0.01~0.3 can \nbe assumed for PEC-R(pu) to count  for almost every size and \ntype of different transformers. This paper adopts a \nconservative approach to use the maximum end of this range, \ni.e. to consider P\nEC-R(pu)=0.3 in loading assessment of any \ntransformer type and size. Then, the POSL-R(pu) parameter can \nbe derived accordingly based on the following approximate \nratios recommended by [2].    \n\n\n\n−≅\n≅\n=\n−\n−\nType filledLiquid For\nType Dry For\npu P\npu P\nR EC\nR OSL\n, 2% 33\n% 67\n, 5 . 0% 67\n% 33\n) (\n) (  (11) \nSince most of the common transformers are of liquid-filled \ntype, for the illustrative and application studies in this paper,  \nPOSL-R(pu) is assumed to be the twice value of  P EC-R(pu). \nApparently, all of the analyses can be performed in a similar \nfashion for dry type transformers by inversing such \nassumption (i.e. to estimate POSL-R(pu) as half of PEC-R(pu)).   \nC.  Summary of the Method \nBased on the above discussions, the overall proposed \nmethodology to quantify loading of a transformer serving \nharmonic loads can be summarized as below: \n1) Measure the transformer current. Then, derive the \nindividual harmonic current components and express them in \nthe per-unit format by using the transformer rated current as \nthe base value (I\nh(pu)=Ih/IR). \n2) For the transformer parameters, assume the P EC-R(pu) to \nbe 0.3  as a conservative approach and determine P OSL-R(pu) \nparameter of the transformer according to (11) (Unless exact \nvalue of P EC-R(pu) & POSL-R(pu) are available for the \ntransformer, which would be a rare scenario as discussed). \n3) Finally, calculate the equivalent loading by using (9). \nThe maximum permissible value of this index to avoid an \noverloading condition is 1pu. In order to quantify the \nincreased amount of loading due to the distorted nature of the \ncurrent, determine harmonic impact index as defined in (10).  \nD.  Illustrative Examples \nAs an illustrative example, the proposed indices are \nemployed in this section for loading assessment of a \ntransformer supplying a sample nonlinear load. The example \nload is a six-pulse converter (with THD of 21.46%, harmonic \nspectrum is per the sample data provided in [16]).  The \nequivalent loading index is calculated for the RMS load \ncurrent varying from 0 to 1 per-unit of the transformer rated \ncurrent.  The result is shown in Fig. 2(a). In addition, K-factor \nis also derived and presented in Fig. 2(b) to provide a \ncomparative analysis with the proposed index. The following \nstandard definition of K-factor is used [2]. \n\n=\n=\n= −\nmax\n1\n2) (\nh h\nh h\nh h pu Ifactor K  (12) \nAs intuitively expected, both K-factor and the equivalent \nloading indices become larger as the current increases. At the \n0.9pu current, the equivalent loading reaches the 1.0pu value. \nIt states that the transformer in this example can supply the \nsample six-pulse converter type of load up to 90% of its rated \ncapacity. The results also show that equivalent loading is \nlinearly correlated with the total RMS current. HITL index is \nalso observed to be a constant value of 11% for different \ncurrent levels. It suggests the interesting fact that impact of \nharmonics on transformer loading is merely dependent on \nharmonic current distribution rather than the amount of load. \nIn other words, the percentage increase in transformer loading \ndue to harmonics is influenced by the load nature rather than \nload size. Therefore, based on the proposed methodology, one \nhas to consider at least 11% capacity margin when choosing a \ntransformer size to serve this type of load.  \n Apparently, the K-factor plot (Fig. 2(b)) does not provide \nany basis for such observations. Besides, it appears as a \nnonlinear function of current. This is in contrast with the \nlinear relationship observed between equivalent loading and \nthe current. In this example, an evaluation based on K-factor \nmight lead to the inaccurate co nclusion that for the loads \nlarger than 60%, the transformer will be overloaded and \nrequire a “K-factor transformer”, which is not true according \nto the equivalent loading index. In general, such comparative \ncases clarify why traditional K-factor index is not sufficient \nto evaluate the equivalent loading of transformers under non-\nsinusoidal conditions.  \n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 10\n0.25\n0.5\n0.75\n1\n1.25\nTotal RMS Current(pu)\nEquivalent Loading Index (pu)\n \n \n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 110\n11\n12\n13\nH-Impact on Transformer Loading(%)\nEquivalent Loading Index(pu)\nHarmonic Impact\n \n(a)Equivalent Loading Index and HITL \n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 10\n1\n2\n3\nTotal RMS Current(pu)\nK-factor\n \n(b)K-factor \nFig. 2 Loading assessment of a transformer supplying a sample 6-pulse \nconverter at different load RMS current levels \n 5\nIII.  FIELD MEASUREMENTS \nIn this section, the proposed methodology is applied to real \nfield measured data associated with a number of transformers \nserving residential loads. The data belongs to 6 different \ntransformers located in Edmonton, Canada. The nominal size \nand voltage rating of the transformers are 37.5kVA and \n25kV:120V:120V (primary: secondary: secondary) \nrespectively. Current of each transformer is measured for \ndifferent period lengths varying from one to four days (the \nwhole set of data collectively includes the full-24 hour data \nfor 23 days).   \nA.  Method Application \nAs an application example, the introduced method is \ndeployed to obtain one-day equivalent loading profile for one \nof the measured transformers. Figures 4 and 5 show the \nharmonic content and average IDD & TDD (Based on [16] \ndefinition)  for the measured current of the chosen \ntransformer. The transformer nominal full-load current is \nselected as the base value for the per-unit quantities of Fig. 3.   \n \n0 6 12 18 240\n0.05\n0.1\n0.15\n0.2\nTime (hour)\nHarmonic current component (pu) \n \n7th Harmonic\n9th Harmonic \n5th Harmonic \n3rd Harmonic \nFundamental Component (divided by 5)\n \nFig. 3 Daily harmonic currents profile for the sample transformer (The \nfundamental component is presented by division on 5 to fit in the plot) \n3rd 5th 7th 9th 11th 13th 15th 17th 19th 21st 23rd 25th TDD0\n2\n4\n6\n8\nHarmonic Order\nDaily Average Current IDD(%)\n \nFig. 4 Daily average harmonic current spectrum of the sample measured \nservice transformer \nThe equivalent loading index calculated for different times \nof the day is shown in Fig. 5. As observed, the index is below \n1 for the whole day, indicating that there is no instance of \noverloading. \nEffect of harmonics is better observed in Fig. 7, where the \nHITL index is plotted besides the current THD. In this case, \nthe impact of harmonics on transformer loading is not \nsignificant by being less than 10% for most of the day. A \ncorrelation between current THD and the Harmonic impact \nindex is clearly observed in this figure. The more distorted \nthe current (higher THD value), the more the impact of \nharmonics is on transformer loading. Once again, it is worth \nto state that such observations would be absent if we limited \nour analysis to usage of a trad itional index such as K-factor \n(see Fig. 6). \n0 6 12 18 240\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nTime (hour)\nLoading(pu)\n \n \nTotal RMS Current\nEquivalent Loading Index\n \n \n \nFig. 5 Daily profile of total RMS current and equivalent loading index for the \nmeasured service transformer  \n0 6 12 18 240\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nTime (hour)\nK-factor\n \nFig. 6 Daily profile of K-factor for the measured service transformer \n0 6 12 18 240\n10\n20\nTime (hour)\nH-Impact on Transformer Loading(%)\n0 6 12 18 240\n20\n40\nCurrent THD(%)\nTHDH-Impact\n \nFig. 7 Daily profile of Harmonic Impact (HITL index) and current THD for \nthe measured service transformer \nB.

CONCLUSIONS \nThis paper presented a new concept and associated indices \nto quantify the impact of harmonics on transformers. The \nindices are developed based on well-established industry \nstandards. Different from existing indices such as the K-\nfactors, the application of the proposed indices is not limited \nto selection of specially designed transformers. The indices \ncan reveal the “true” loading of a transformer under harmonic \nconditions and they can be understood intuitively by people \nwith limited power quality knowledge. Potential use of the \nindices includes estimating transformer overloading level due \nto harmonics and determining the MVA size of a regular \ntransformer that can operate properly for given harmonic rich \nconditions. \nStudies on field measured data showed that the impact of \nharmonics generated by residential loads on a transformer is \napproximately proportional to square of transformer current \nTHD. For example, if a distorted current with THD of 8% is \ncurrently increasing power loss in a transformer by 5%, one \ncan predict that a twice value of current THD (i.e. 16%) will \nintroduce four times amount of extra equivalent loading (i.e. \n20%) in the same transformer. Such approximate relationship \ncan serve as a useful guideline for utilities to plan capacity \nmargin for new transformers serving residential loads.  \n     \nV.  R\nEFERENCES \n[1] J. M.
