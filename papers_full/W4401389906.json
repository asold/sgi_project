  "abstract": "The natural language capabilities demonstrated by large language models (LLMs) highlight an opportunity for new writing support tools that address the varied needs of people with dyslexia. We present LaMPost, a prototype email editor that draws upon our understanding of these needs to motivate AI-powered writing features, such as outlining main ideas, generating a subject line, suggesting changes, and rewriting a selection. We evaluated LaMPost with 19 adults with dyslexia, identifying promising routes for further exploration (such as the popular “rewrite” and “subject line” features), while also finding that the current generation of LLMs may not yet meet the accuracy and quality thresholds to be useful for writers with dyslexia. In addition, knowledge of the AI did not alter participants’ perception of the system nor their feelings of autonomy, expression, and self-efficacy when writing emails. Our findings provide insight into the benefits and drawbacks of LLMs as writing support for adults with dyslexia, and they offer a foundation to build upon in future research.",
