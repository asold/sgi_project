INTRODUCTION \nFuture substation design depends on finding a way to \nemploy the efficiency of the solid state switches of power \nelectronics in the LV network that dispels the drawbacks of \nthe traditional legacy system  [1]. Electronic approaches will \ninform the acceptable choice for future hardware \nimplementation of substation from a power electronics \nviewpoint, necessitating a tradeoff between flexibility, control \nfunction, efficiency and cost  [1]. In distribution transformers, \nthe ratio between the secondary and primary voltage is fixed \nand cannot be changed, where the use of the on -load tap \nchangers (used in transformers) is limited, especially in the \nUK [2]. Poor voltage regulation is a direct r eason for losses \nand shortening the life of several devices, whereas proper \nvoltage regulation improves the quality of the delivered \npower. In low voltage conditions, the equipment works with a \nlower power factor and draws more current with constant \npower consumption, which means more losses in the feeders \ndue to the relation=I2R [2]. \nThe designers  of conventional substation transformers \nmaintain the nominal voltage at the secondary side of the \ntransformer to compensate the voltage drop accrued by the \ntransformer and the impedance of the feeder s. The tolerated \nvoltage is usually 10% [2, 3], as shown in Fig. 1.  If the \nvoltage exceeds these limits, other devices and equipment \nmight be damaged . Although the voltage is not supposed to \nexceed this limit according  to regulations, increasing future \ndemand and changing load types can cause increases. The \nnature of low voltage circuits differs from HV circuits, as low \nvoltage circuits  have a resistive nature more than inductive \nnature, which means that these circuits are capacity \nconstrained by voltage regulation and not current flow [4]. \nFig. 1. Voltage drop behavior in LV networks \nThis paper proposes a voltage regulation approach for LV \nnetworks with a design based on the i nteraction between PE  \nswitches and the windings of the conventional transformer . \nThe design is introduced as a hybrid distribution transformer , \nwhich is a voltage compensation approach  that enhances the \ncontrol at the low voltage side of the transformer (or the high \nvoltage side in oth er configurations  as in Ref [3] ). The \napproach includes a distribution transformer with an attached \nfractionally rated PE converter, which contributes to \nsupplying the transformer with additional controllability , and \nwhich could be used to control either voltage or reactive \npower compensation, or both of these functionalities in some \ncontrol configurations as in [5].  \nII. VOLTAGE REGULATION TECHNIQUES  \nMechanical methods such as on load tap changers in \ndistribution networks are not commonly used in voltage \nregulation in the EU, especially the UK, for the following \nreasons [6]: \n Frequent maintenance requirements for mechanical \nparts. \n High amount of losses during the changing process. \n The distribution network demands frequent voltage \ncontrol actions during the day , which decrease s the \nlifespan of the mechanical taps significantly. \n In distribution network, the ARC of the tap changer \nis close to the load. \nGrid\nLV \nTransformer\nV\nP Q\nLine length\nΔV (±10%)\nAC\nDC\nDC\nAC\nV SE\nV Load\nV contV TE\nI PR\nI SE\nVoltage regulation is commonly understood and applied \n(e.g. in the UK) in terms of several fixed voltage boosts that \nare applied at different areas of the network ; this provides for \nconstant voltage decrease, which could be true these days but \nwhich will not be true for the different future scenarios of the \nnetwork [7] and [8] . Typical voltage drops in the UK and \ncompensations are illustrated in the following diagram.  \nMain 11KV feeder distributor is %6 11/.433Kv transformer is %3\n400V circuit is 7% Consumer circuit 1.5%\nThe total drops varies between 17.5% and 1.5% in very light load \nFig. 2. Typical voltage drops in the distribution in UK \nThe older specification of \"240V -10, +6%\" means that the \nvoltage has a limit of 216, 254.4V. The revised specification \n(EN50160) says \"230V -6 +10%\" , which equates to 216.2, \n253V [18]. T o compensate for this drop, several voltage \nboosts are applied in different areas of the network , as shown \nbelow. \nMain 11KV Transformer: %5 Distribution transformer: 4% plus \n2.5% through off load taps\nThe total boost is +11.5%\nConsumer voltage varies between (+11.5%, -17.5%) which is -%6\nAnd (+11.5%, 1.5%) which is +10%\nThese limits are allowed and occurs within the regulation limits\n \nFig. 3. The voltage level at the substation is installed high enough to \ncompensate the voltage drop in the line under maximum load conditions \nThe distribution system has the transformer on one side and \na large amount of customer s on the other , which \nfundamentally unbalances the system ; this is important and \nneeds to be taken into account by voltage regulation studies. \nPower converter design should help to meet the requirements \nof the current and the future substations by operating \ninteractively with other PE  and conventional devices in the \nLV network to sustain continuous voltage regulation, voltage \nbalance, and partial power factor correction with the aim of \nminimizing losses as much as possible [9].    \nIII. DESIGN AND APPROACH \nIf only a ±10% voltage limit for regulation  is taken into  \nconsideration by the regulator, the switches of the PE  \nconverter can be designed at fractional ratings  (around 10 -\n20%) of the total ratings of the LV transformer, which are the \nratings that are needed to control the voltage regulation \ninterval [3]. The following functionalities for the hybrid \ntransformer could be achieved and considered according to its \nconfigurations [5]: \n Voltage regulation of up to ±20%.  \n Reactive power control of up to ±20. \n A combination of both topologies may be achieved \nas long as the total rating of the PE part is not \nexceeded. \n The attached converter can be protected by being \nbypassed in case of a failure within the system. \nFig. 4. AC regulation by using basic hybrid transformer [3] \n \nThe fractional rating of the attached converter provides the \noverall system with the following advantages: \n Lower cost and higher reliability compared to the \nfull rated PE \n Lower switching losses due to reducing the overall \nswitches’ ratings. \n The transformer is one of the most reliable devices \nin the network , thus its latent advantages are \nexploited. \n The system tastes partially the PE functionalities that \ncould be bypassed in case of PE failure \nFractional power electronics are designed as a back -to-\nback converter to control three unbalanced phases, each of \nwhich supplies three feeders to form nine lines that emerge \nfrom the transformer. Most feede rs are made up of three \nphases and four wires , the latter of which is usually the \nneutral one . T he three -phased feeder can usually range in \nlength depending on load density , thus the introduced design \ntakes into consideration an unbalanced system that need s \nvoltage regulation for each phase separately  [9], by attaching \neither three single -phase converters with the transformer as \nseen in Ref [10], or using a three-phase converter. \nThe main function of the converter is to sustain a constant \noutput voltage , to minimis the voltage fluctuations in the \nevent of high or low demand.  \n \nV SE\nV contV TE\nPE \nConverter \nA\nV SE\nV cont\nPE \nConverter \nB\nV SE\nV cont\nPE \nConverter \nC\nV TE\nV TE\nPhase A\nPhase B\nPhase C\n N\n \nFig. 5. The proposed hybrid transformer is introduced as a normal \ntransformer that is attached partially with an AC/AC converter with a DC \nlink [10]. \nFuture scenarios require increasing attention to this \nfunction (e.g. increasing prevalence of electrical cars, \nwhereby users plug and unplug their cars to charge frequently \nduring the day), and it keeps the voltage and the current at the \nside of the transformer substantially in phase. \nIV.   TOPOLOGIES AND OPTIONS \nThe different position s and various configurations for PE \nconverters allow the transformer to perform various functions \nbeside different techniques in regulating the voltage. \nTABLE 1 \nDIFFERENT CONFIGURATIONS AND VARIOUS CAPABILITIES  \nConceptual schematics Capabilities \nAC\nDC\nV out\nV TE\nI PR\n[5] \nOption one has the ability to operate a \nPF corrector for both displacement and \ndistortion PF (harmonic filter). It also \nhas an isolated DC source that could \noperate through th e bidirectional DC -\nAC converter [5]. \nAC\nDC\nV out\nI PR\n[5] \nOption two is similar to option one but \nwith an output that includes the voltage \nof the capacitor. It has the ability to do \nphase shifting and inject voltage as \nneeded to maintain a constant level of \noperational voltage [5]. \nAC\nDC\nV out\nI PR\n[5] \nThis option could be used as flicker \ncontrol, whereby a bidirectional \nconverter contributes to correcting the \npower factor and charge/dischar ge \nvoltage in/from the secondary windings \n[5]. \nAC\nDC\nDC\nAC\nV primary\nV in\nV cont\n[3] \nThis approach deals with problems from \nthe HV side, regulating the voltage and \nundertaking phase shifting from the \nprimary side. The converter deals with \nlow current and high voltage ratings [3]. \nAC\nDC\nDC\nAC\n[3] \nThis approach does most of the \nmentioned functions and regulates the \nvoltage with a converter that deals low \nvoltage and high current ratings. It also \nhas the ability to provide a DC link to \nthe LV side. \nAC\nDC\nDC\nAC\nV out\nV contV TE\nThree windings \ntransformer\n \nAdding a series transformer would \ncontribute to decreasing the rating of the \ncurrent that the converter deals with. \nThis means that the converter has the \nability to deal with low ratings for the \ncurrent and the voltage  \n \nEvery configuration has its own operational mode that \nprovides the unit with different control abilities  [5]. Possible \nconceptual schematics for the hybrid transformer are shown \nin Table 1, where every configuration has its own scheme in \nattaching the po wer electronics to the hybrid distribution \ntransformer. The capability of each configuration is \nsummarised in Table 1. \nV. CONTROL TOPOLOGY  \nA resonant controller is taken into consideration to track a \nsinusoidal wave reference beside the need of controlling \nspecific harmonic orders  for a resistive load . Also , the dq \ntransformation technique is used to control the voltage at the \nDC link terminals [12], whereby the overall controller adds or \ndecrease voltage (10% - 20%) to/from the total output voltage \nin order to control the whole output voltage of the \ntransformer.  \nThe transformer ratios are [2]:  \n 𝑉 𝑠𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑎𝑟𝑦 =\n𝑁2\n𝑁1  × 𝑉𝑠 \n  Vtertiary =\nN3\nN1  × Vs \n VPE out = 𝐷 × 𝑉𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑟𝑦  \nWhere VPE out is the output voltage of the converter, so V out \ncan be expressed as [2]:    \n \n                              Vout = Vsecondary + VPE out   \n                             Vout  =  \n𝑁2+(𝐷×𝑁3)\n𝑁1  × 𝑉𝑠                 \nV secondary\nV secondary\nV secondary\nV tertiary\n Normal state\nVoltage increase \ncontrol\nVoltage decrease \ncontrol\n \nFig. 6. Voltage control is applied in case of over voltage or under -voltage \nincidents at the output of the transformer ; voltage control is chosen as a \nbalance between the output of the secondary windings and the ac -ac \nconverter [2]. \nThe transformer supports a par t of supplied voltage and the \nPE converter controls the other part of the voltage ( voltage \nvariations). If a voltage decrease occurs in the distribution \nline, the converter duty ratio correspondingly increases; \nconversely, when voltage increase occurs, the converter duty \nratio decreases  [11]. A v ector diagram of voltage control is \nshown in Fig. 6. \nA.

Control structure of the VSC in the DC side [13] \nVoltage and currents are described as vectors in the \nstationary αβ and transformed after that to  dq coordinates to \nbe controlled by two loops: inner loop for the current control \nand outer loop for the DC vol tage control. The controlled \ncoordinates are then transformed to feed the PWM generator \nin order to control the DC output of the converter. The inner \nloop transfer function and outer TF are stated in equations 6 \nand 7 respectively [13]. \n   𝐺𝑜.𝐿 =  𝐾𝑝.

By this control the fluctuation in the DC link is \nminimised to enable fast and stable control for the AC side of \nthe converter.  \nB. Resonant control for the AC output voltage  \nThe normal dq controller is appropriate for a balanced or \nslightly unbalanced system, whereby the transformation to dq \nframe can give an accepted performance, but in case of \ndealing with a severely unbalanced system the resonant \ncontroller (RC) is applied, as it is used in several approaches \nsuch as distribution generation and wind and solar energy.    \nIn this paper the RC is chosen to control the voltage of the \nthree phases separately by tracking a sinusoidal reference that \ntakes its angle from phase locked loop (PLL) measurements \nfrom the network [14]. The resonant controller could be used \nalso to eliminate specific harmonic orders beside controlling \nthe output voltage  as in Ref [15] . The proposed resonant \ncontrol design is shown in Fig. 8; each phase is controlled \nseparately due to the fact that each one is loaded differently.   \nResonant controller \nPhase A Z-1 ZOH PLANT\n+\n_\nV*\nPLL\nVa\nFig. 8.

FINDINGS AND RESULTS  \nThe DC link of the back -to-back converter is controlled by \nusing a dq transformation, as seen in Fig. 10. \nFig. 10. dq transformation technique \nThe control is used to maintain the DC voltage fixed at the \nterminal of the linked capacitor, in order to provid e the AC \npart of the converter with a stable source of power  [16]. The \nDC output responds to the reference of the controller and step \nup/down to the required value, as illustrated in Fig. 11. \nFig. 11. Control response for the DC link \nThe AC side of the converter is controlled where the output \nof the converter is operating under several loading conditions, \nincluding voltage variations such as sags and short transient \ntime [5]. LC filter is used to get a sinusoidal wave. Long time \n(sag) voltage regulation signal is illustrated below, before and \nafter using the AC side of the transformer. \nFig. 12: Long time (sag) voltage regulation \nThis approach also provides the possibility of regulating \nthe voltage over short transient time (second by second) , as \nseen below  in Fig. 1 3, where the reference of the voltage \ncontrol is fixed and controlled in this case at the nominal \nvoltage level, so the voltage regulation interval is decreased \nto be almost ±0% instead of ±10%. \nFig. 13 Short transient time regulation \nThe voltage output is controlled during short and long time \nvariations, which enhances the operation of sensitive voltage \nloads that require a firm and accurate voltage level , such as \napplications in medical equipment, where over -voltage can \ndamage some electronic devices and reduce their operational \nlife. On the other hand, decreasing the voltage can result in \ndisabling the operation of these sensitive devices. The control \nof switches tries to provide a stable a DC link as a first level \nof control in order to isolate the variations of the input from \nthe output, which ensures stable operation for the control at \nTime (seconds)\nDC voltage\nthe AC side (final o utput), The DC link has the ability to be \nimproved and used to provide a DC output source for a DC \nline or network in an enhanced form for the control, so it \ncould operate synchronously between providing stability for \nthe AC side and feeding a DC line (suc h as a DC network or \ncharging a battery to be used in case of system failure) as a \nUPS approach as in Ref [17].  \nVII. CONCLUSION \nOwing to the expectations of increased load growth in \nfuture, the design of the LV substations entails specific \nrequirements and imp rovements depending on the flexibility \nof PE in order to decrease the voltage variations and losses in \nLV network that increase by the time. The absence of tap \ncontrol in 11/0.4 kV transformer addresses a voltage \nregulation problem : the existence of high v oltage (HV) tap \nchangers cannot help in case of load rich feeders in the last \nmile of the network. Voltage regulation could be feasible in \nthe LV network by us ing PE functionality attached with the \nlast point in the network [1] (before the loads point). \nThe hybrid distribution transformer is introduced as an \napproach that has the potential to upgrade the operation of the \nnew LV substation to a new level that has the ability to meet \nthe demand of the future distribution grid from an efficiency, \ncontrollability and volume perspective. Different conceptual \nschematics for the design of hybrid distribution transformer \nwere introduced that have different abilities in serving several \nrequirements in the LV network according to expected \nincidents of voltage variatio n scenarios and Var control  [3]. \nBack-to-back converter was designed to represent the \nattached PE, which is controlled at two stages; the first stage \nuses dq transformation for the purpose of fixing the voltage of \nthe DC link, and the second stage aims to individually control \neach of the three phases at the AC output of the transformer \nusing a resonant controller that has a sinusoidal voltage wave \nas a reference. The result s of this have illustrated the \nconverter's ability to control the voltage over short and long \ntime voltage variations , which inform s the choice of future \nsubstation hardware implementations by initializ ing a \nreasonable percentage of PE switches that operate with \nconventional reliable equipment, such as transformers. \nVIII.
