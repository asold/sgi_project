    "abstract": "Importance Use of asynchronous text-based counseling is rapidly growing as an easy-to-access approach to behavioral health care. Similar to in-person treatment, it is challenging to reliably assess as measures of process and content do not scale. Objective To use machine learning to evaluate clinical content and client-reported outcomes in a large sample of text-based counseling episodes of care. Design, Setting, and Participants In this quality improvement study, participants received text-based counseling between 2014 and 2019; data analysis was conducted from September 22, 2022, to November 28, 2023. The deidentified content of messages was retained as a part of ongoing quality assurance. Treatment was asynchronous text-based counseling via an online and mobile therapy app (Talkspace). Therapists were licensed to provide mental health treatment and were either independent contractors or employees of the product company. Participants were self-referred via online sign-up and received services via their insurance or self-pay and were assigned a diagnosis from their health care professional. Exposure All clients received counseling services from a licensed mental health clinician. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcomes were client engagement in counseling (number of weeks), treatment satisfaction, and changes in client symptoms, measured via the 8-item version of Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8). A previously trained, transformer-based, deep learning model automatically categorized messages into types of therapist interventions and summaries of clinical content. Results The total sample included 166 644 clients treated by 4973 therapists (20 600 274 messages). Participating clients were predominantly female (75.23%), aged 26 to 35 years (55.4%), single (37.88%), earned a bachelor’s degree (59.13%), and were White (61.8%). There was substantial variability in intervention use and treatment content across therapists. A series of mixed-effects regressions indicated that collectively, interventions and clinical content were associated with key outcomes: engagement (multiple R = 0.43), satisfaction (multiple R = 0.46), and change in PHQ-8 score (multiple R = 0.13). Conclusions and Relevance This quality improvement study found associations between therapist interventions, clinical content, and client-reported outcomes. Consistent with traditional forms of counseling, higher amounts of supportive counseling were associated with improved outcomes. These findings suggest that machine learning–based evaluations of content may increase the scale and specificity of psychotherapy research.",
