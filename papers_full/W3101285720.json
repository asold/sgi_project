INTRODUCTION\nThe excitation characteristics and no-load loss of a trans-\nformer are important indicators to evaluate its performance.\nDue to the complicated magnetic material properties of the\ntransformer core, it is difﬁcult to build the core model and\ncalculate the core loss, thus making the core loss prediction\neven harder [1]–[3]. Currently, the methods for core loss\ncalculation of different silicon steel types in a wide magnetic\nﬂux density range still remain problematic, which makes\nthe calculation of the iron loss an important issue under\nstudy [4].\nIn the Jiles-Atherton model, the magnetic hysteresis phe-\nnomena was studied according to macroscopic energy cal-\nculation [5], while in the Preisach model, the theoretical\nanalysis on the model itself was made based on the statistics\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Feiqi Deng\n .\nof magnetic domain movement in time and space. But they\nboth relied on a large number of measurement data, which\nbrought certain limitations to the research [6]. Steinmetz\nsummarized an empirical formula for the per unit volume\nmagnetic loss in 1982 which is simple in form and has\nfew parameters [7] and is widely used in iron loss calcu-\nlation of electromagnetic equipment such as transformers.\nAs a matter of fact, it is also the basis of other iron loss\ncalculation models. The idea of loss separation was pro-\nposed by Bertotti in 1988 [8]. According to the mecha-\nnism of the loss generated by ferromagnetic materials under\nthe action of alternating magnetic ﬁeld, the iron loss can\nbe decomposed into three parts, named the hysteresis loss,\nthe energy loss caused by the friction between the domains;\neddy current loss, the joule loss caused by the induced cur-\nrent in ferromagnetic materials; abnormal loss respectively,\ncaused by eddy currents in alternating leakage magnetic\nﬁelds [9].\nVOLUME 8, 2020 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Liet al.: Improved Loss-Separation Method for Transformer Core Loss Calculation\nBased on the Bertotti model, scholars has been trying to\novercome the difﬁculty in separating the core loss [10]–[12].\nIn this article, multiple sets of commonly used silicon steels\nwere studied. The results of the variational magnetic ﬂux\ndensity method were in good agreement with the experimen-\ntal ones in the low-magnetic ﬂux density range. However,\nthe calculation results become unreliable as the magnetic ﬂux\ndensity increases gradually. Although by using frequency-\nvariation method, the inﬂuence of the frequency on the\nhysteresis loss is inevitable, it still has a large calculation\nerror [13]. At the same time, this method has higher require-\nments on the frequency data, and the selection of different\nfrequency data has a great impact on the calculation results,\nwhich affects its practicability.\nTherefore, the direct application of the Bertotti model\nor other improved method to certain types of silicon steels\nduring the loss separation, and it works well in the low\nmagnetic ﬂux density range. However, due to the typical\nnon-linear characteristics of the oriented silicon steel sheet,\nserious distortion emerges in the high magnetic ﬂux density\nrange (over 1.5 T) [14], resulting in a large calculation error\nof about 50%. Accordingly, the constant coefﬁcient model\ncannot accurately describe the loss changes of ferromag-\nnetic materials in various magnetic ﬂux density ranges, nor\ncan it take into account the inﬂuence of core oversatura-\ntion in high magnetic ﬂux density range on the loss [15],\nwhich leads to the poor practicability and separation accu-\nracy. In order to make up for the deﬁciency of the Bertotti\nmodel in describing the magnetic ﬂux density saturation of\nthe core, references [16] and [17] adopted the method by\nadding a compensation term to the original eddy current\nloss to solve the problem that the calculated value is smaller\nthan the total loss. In fact, the thickness of oriented silicon\nsteel used in transformers is much smaller than the skin\ndepth under the operating frequency [18], thus the magnetic\npermeability in silicon steel sheet is almost uniform and the\ncore eddy current loss can be directly obtained without any\ncompensation [19].\nIn addition, scholars at home and abroad have attached\ngreat importance to the measurement method of magnetiza-\ntion properties of magnetic materials. At present, there are\nthree kinds of measurement methods with high degree of\nrecognition: the monolithic measurement method, the ring\nsample method and the Epstein frame method [20]–[22].\nAmong them, the Epstein frame measurement method is\nmore traditional and is widely used as the main mea-\nsurement method of electrical ferromagnetic materials in\nChina. In standard IEC 60404-2:1996 and GB/T 3655-2088,\nthe measuring condition and procedure of transformer core\nloss are given.\nThe rest of this article is organized as follows. The\nmethod overview was presented in Section II. In section III,\nthe Epstein frame platform was introduced. Section IV gives\nthe veriﬁcation of improved loss separation method, followed\nby its application in Section V . In section VI, the conclusion\nis given.\nFIGURE 1. Comparison of calculated hysteresis loss and measured one\nfor B27R095 by variational magnetic flux density method.\nII. METHOD OVERVIEW\nA. TRADITIONAL LOSS SEPARATION METHODS BASED ON\nBERTOTTI MODEL\nThe trinomial core loss separation model proposed by Bertotti\nin 1988 is the most commonly used loss separation model at\npresent. The core loss can be expanded into the form shown\nin (1):\nPtot =Ph +Pe +Pex\n=khBα\nm f +keB2\nm f 2 +kexB1.5\nm f 1.5 (1)\nwhere Ptot is the total core speciﬁc loss per unit mass, W/kg;\nPh, Pe and Pex respectively represent the hysteresis loss per\nunit mass, eddy current loss per unit mass and abnormal\nloss per unit mass, W/kg; f is frequency, Hz; Bm is the\namplitude of magnetic ﬂux density, T; kh, ke, kexand α are\nthe coefﬁcients related to the microstructure of ferromagnetic\nmaterials.\nFor better illustration, two traditional loss separation meth-\nods were analyzed in this part.\n1) VARIATIONAL MAGNETIC FLUX DENSITY METHOD\nFor the method based on Bertotti model, the steps are as fol-\nlows: by changing the excitation voltage, the loss under dif-\nferent magnetic ﬂux density is obtained; then the regression\nequation is set up by a mathematical statistics method and\nthe measured Bm-Ptot data are used for regression calculation\naccording to the Bertotti model; after that, four coefﬁcient,\nkh, ke, kex and α, are obtained and the three kinds of loss\nis successfully separated. Figure 1 shows the comparison\nbetween the calculated hysteresis loss and the measured value\nof the electrical steel sheet with type of B27R095 under the\npower frequency sinusoidal excitation.\nAs in Fig. 1, although the calculated results were in good\nagreement with the experimental ones in a low magnetic ﬂux\ndensity range, they tended to deviate from the measured ones\nwhen the magnetic ﬂux density increases to 1.7 T and the\niron core approaches saturation. In fact, the calculated results\nare smaller, and the error increases with the increase of the\nmagnetic ﬂux density.\n2) FREQUENCY-VARIATION METHOD\nIn addition, the frequency-variation method was adopted [23].\nAccording to the fact that the hysteresis loss term is a linear\nfunction of f , equation (2) can be obtained by dividing both\n204848 VOLUME 8, 2020\nH. Liet al.: Improved Loss-Separation Method for Transformer Core Loss Calculation\nFIGURE 2. Comparisons between calculated hysteresis loss and\nmeasured one, and calculated specified total loss and measured one for\n27ZH95 by frequency-variation method.\nTABLE 1. Loss separation results of 27ZH95 by frequency-variation\nmethod.\nends of (1) by f .\nPtot\nf =Ph\nf +Pe\nf +Pex\nf\n=khBh\nm +keB2\nm f +kexB1.5\nm f 0.5 (2)\nAs be seen from above, when Bm is ﬁxed, the hysteresis\nloss in each cycle is a ﬁxed value. The value of core loss at\ndifferent frequencies can be obtained through experimental\nmeasurement and the f-Ptot/f curve can be plotted. In this way,\nthe hysteresis loss can be obtained through curve intercept.\nWhen using this method, a ﬁxed value of the magnetic ﬂux\ndensity Bm should be ensured. In this article, the high-quality\nsilicon steel sheet with the type of 27ZH95 is selected as\nexample. Six representative test points of the magnetic ﬂux\ndensity, namely 0.8 T, 1.0 T, 1.1 T, 1.3 T, 1.5 T, 1.7 T, 1.8 T\nand 1.9 T, were measured and analyzed by the above method\nfor loss separation. By calculating the loss coefﬁcients under\neach of the magnetic ﬂux density, the hysteresis loss, eddy\ncurrent loss and abnormal loss of the selected steel sheet can\nbe obtained.\nFigure 2 shows the comparison between the results of spe-\nciﬁc total loss and hysteresis loss calculated by the frequency-\nvariation method and the measured results of electrical steel\nsheet 27ZH95 under a sinusoidal power frequency excitation.\nAs shown in Fig. 2, although the error of speciﬁed total loss\nin calculated results was slight compared with the measured\none, the hysteresis loss calculated by frequency-variation\nmethod was smaller than the measured one, and the error\ntended to increase with the increase of magnetic ﬂux density.\nTable 1 shows the loss separation results of 27ZH95 silicon\nsteel sheet under sinusoidal excitation at the power frequency.\nGenerally, when the transformer works normally, the mag-\nnetic ﬂux density Bm of the core is about 1.7 T. It has been\npointed out in the transformer design principle that in high-\nquality silicon steel sheets, the hysteresis loss accounts for\nabout 20%-30% in the whole core loss, the eddy current\nloss accounts for about 20%-30%, and the abnormal loss\naccounts for about 40%-50%. In fact, for the loss separation\nresults of silicon steel sheet 27ZH95 obtained by frequency-\nvariation method, when Bm =1.7 T, the hysteresis loss was\n0.148 W/kg, accounting for 15.5% of the total loss; the eddy\ncurrent loss was 0.1508 W/kg, accounting for 15.8%; the\nabnormal loss was 0.653W/kg, accounting for 68.7%. Obvi-\nously, they did not conform the transformer design principle,\nwhich means that the obtained results are not accurate.\nB. IMPROVED LOSS SEPARATION METHOD\nAs analyzed above, the traditional Bertotti model performs\nwell in the low magnetic ﬂux density range of 0-1.5 T;\nhowever, it does not consider the non-linear characteristics of\nthe core, nor does it take into account the inﬂuence of the core\noversaturation on the loss in the high magnetic ﬂux density\nrange. As the magnetic ﬂux density exceeds 1.5 T, the error\nof the separation result increases signiﬁcantly. In the light\nof the limitation of traditional Bertotti core loss separation\nmodel, an improved loss separation method is proposed in\nthis article. First, the eddy current loss is separated from the\ntotal core loss for it is easy to calculate; then, taking 1.5 T as\nthe threshold, the value below 1.5 T named the low magnetic\nﬂux density range and the value above 1.5 T named the high\nmagnetic ﬂux density range. Then, according to the saturation\ndegree of the steel, the ﬁtting calculation and the correction\nof the coefﬁcients are performed. In the low magnetic ﬂux\ndensity range, the traditional separation loss calculation based\non Bertotti model is performed to obtain kh, kex, α and γ;\nwhile in the high magnetic ﬂux density range, the hysteresis\nloss and eddy current loss are calculated by using the loss data\nof oversaturated magnetic ﬂux density [24]. The details are as\nfollows.\n1) EDDY CURRENT LOSS OF SILICON STEEL\nAccording to the thickness of the currently used laminated\nsteel sheet (most of them is less than 0.3 mm or even 0.18 mm)\nwhich is far less than the skin depth, the magnetic ﬂux density\nbe assumed to uniform in the steel sheet [25]. Therefore,\nthe eddy current loss can be directly obtained by calculation.\nBy using (3) and (4), the eddy current loss of the steel sheet\nunder different magnetic ﬂux densities can be calculated,\nwhich directly reduces the number of terms to be separated\nin the traditional model.\nPe =ke(fBm)2 (3)\nwhere ke is the coefﬁcient of eddy current loss\nke = π2\n6ρρfe\n12\nfe (4)\nVOLUME 8, 2020 204849\nH. Liet al.: Improved Loss-Separation Method for Transformer Core Loss Calculation\nwhere ρ is the electrical conductivity of silicon steel sheet,\nρfeis the material density, and 1feis the sheet steel thickness.\n2) COEFFICIENT CALCULATION OF LOW MAGNETIC FLUX\nDENSITY RANGE\nBased on the Bertotti model, the coefﬁcients in the low\nmagnetic ﬂux density range of 0 T-1.5 T are calculated by\nutilizing the measured loss data, and the values of hysteresis\nloss and abnormal loss are obtained. In addition to the eddy\ncurrent loss, the hysteresis loss and abnormal loss in the low\nmagnetic ﬂux density range can be calculated by (5):\nPlow\ntot −Pe =Ph +Pex =khBα\nm f +kex (Bm f )1.5 (5)\nThe mathematical method of replacing the ﬁxed constants\n1.5 by variable coefﬁcient γ, is able to reduce the calculation\nerror. Usually in the traditional Bertotti model, the power\nexponent of the abnormal loss is a ﬁxed value, while in this\narticle, γ is used to replace it and its value range is speciﬁed\nin the calculation which will be illustrated in the following.\nThe values of kh, kex, α and γ are required for the coef-\nﬁcient calculation in the low magnetic ﬂux density range.\nThrough the calculation of multiple groups of experimental\ndata, it is found that the three loss coefﬁcients, kh, ke and kex,\nare all constants with the magnitude of about 10 −3, while the\nexponential coefﬁcients α and γ are the variables between\n1 and 2. Some attention should be paid to limiting the value\nrange of each coefﬁcient in calculation. The preliminary\ncalculation equation is shown as follows :\nPlow\ntot −Pe =Ph +Pex =khBα\nm f +kex (Bm f )γ (6)\n3) COEFFICIENT CORRECTION IN HIGH MAGNETIC FLUX\nDENSITY RANGE\nWhen the magnetic ﬂux density is within the range of 1.5\nT-2.0 T the transformer core approaches to saturation. It can\nbe seen from Fig. 1 that the hysteresis loss calculated by the\nBertotti model is far less than the measured one. Therefore,\nthe coefﬁcient correction for the hysteresis loss and eddy cur-\nrent loss calculation should be studied. Since it is necessary\nto keep the functional characteristics of the original loss with\nrespect to frequency unchanged, the compensation term is\ndesigned as a function of magnetic ﬂux density, as shown\nin (7):\nPhi\ntot =Ph\n(\n1 +k1Bα1\nm\n)\n+Pe\n(\n1 +k2Bβ1\nm\n)\n+Pex (7)\nAmong them, k1, k2, α1 and β1 are four variable correction\ncoefﬁcients whose values are basically stable in the same\nmaterial with different magnetic ﬂux density, but vary greatly\nin different materials.\nIn this article, the Marquardt method combined with the\ngeneral global optimization algorithm is adopted in the\ncoefﬁcient calculation and correction process [26]–[28].\nThe advantage of this algorithm is that it can reduce the\nrequirements for initial value, improve the self-adaptability of\ncorrection, and thus improve the accuracy of\nnonlinear calculation. The iteration process of the improved\nalgorithm is described in (8):\n{\nXs+1 =Xs +1\n1 =−(JT\nf Jf +λI)−1JT\nf f (8)\nwhere X represents the unknown coefﬁcient to be ﬁtted; J is\nthe Jacobian matrix; I is the unit matrix; 1 is the iterative\nincremental; f represents the speciﬁc total loss vector whose\ndimension depends on the number of collection points.\nThe calculational methods of the improved loss separation\nmodel under different magnetic ﬂux density range are given\nabove, and the suggested initial values of the coefﬁcients are\nalso given according to our practical experimental experi-\nences. In this way, the deﬁciency of the original model in\ndescribing the nonlinear characteristics of the core is made up\nfor and the calculation error is reduced signiﬁcantly. In order\nto verify the effectiveness and accuracy of the improved loss\nseparation method proposed in this article, the Epstein frame\nplatform for loss measurement was built according to the\ninternational standard to measure the speciﬁc total loss of\nsilicon steel sheet so as to verify the improved method.\nIII. EPSTEIN FRAME PLATFORM FOR\nCORE LOSS MEASUREMENT\nIn order to accurately obtain loss of the oriented sil-\nicon steel, according to the international standard IEC\n60404-2:1996 and the national standard GB/T 3655-2008,\na magnetic characteristic measurement platform based on a\n25 cm square frame was built to measure the speciﬁc total\nloss of the silicon steel sheet [29].\nA. MEASUREMENT PRINCIPLE\nIn terms of requirements for instruments in measuring cir-\ncuits, IEC 60404-2:1996 and GB/T 3655-2008 speciﬁes that\nthe measuring precision of voltmeters shall be 0.2% or bet-\nter; the precision of the actual power factor for the power\nmeter should be ±0.5% or better. The precision of frequency\nmeter should be ±0.1% or better; the power supply shall\nhave a low internal resistance, the voltage shall be highly\nstable, the frequency error shall be kept within ±0.2%, and\nthe waveform factor of the secondary voltage shall be kept\nwithin 1.111±1% when measuring the total loss. The circuit\ndiagram of measurement is shown in Fig. 3.\nIn the measurement process, the Pm measured by the power\nmeter also includes the instrument loss in the secondary loop,\nso the total loss power Pc of the silicon steel sheet should be\ncalculated according to (9). The speciﬁc total loss Ptotis the\nratio of the total loss Pc to the effective mass m of the sample.\nPc =N1\nN2\nPm −(1.111|U2|)2\nRi\n(9)\nB. CONSTRUCTION OF MEASUREMENT SYSTEM\nIn this article, the Epstein frame measurement system was\nbuilt according to the standard IEC 60404-2. A signal gen-\nerator was used instead of traditional voltage regulator to\n204850 VOLUME 8, 2020\nH. Liet al.: Improved Loss-Separation Method for Transformer Core Loss Calculation\nFIGURE 3. Circuit diagram of loss measurement.\nFIGURE 4. Epstein frame measurement system.\ngenerate excitation of any frequency within DC-20KHz. The\npower analyzer was used to implement the measurement of\nvoltage and current and calculate the power value directly.\nThe basic precision is up to ±0.02% of the reading, higher\nthan the measurement standard of 0.5%. Moreover, the appar-\nent power and active power of the tested sample can also be\nmeasured. A digital oscilloscope was used to directly observe\nand record the signal waveform of the measured parameters.\nIn this article, the measurement platform built based on the\nEpstein frame can be used to complete the measurement\nof the electrical quantity of the tested sample, such as the\nprimary side voltage of the coil, secondary side current, core\nloss, etc. The schematic diagram of the measurement system\nand models of equipment are shown in Fig. 4.\nUsing the above method to build the Epstein frame\nmeasurement platform for oriented silicon steel, this article\nmeasured 14 kinds of common industrial silicon steel sheets.\nFigure 5 shows the measured results of speciﬁc total loss\nof 30ZH105 and B27R095 silicon steel plates, and the mag-\nnetic ﬂux density range is 0 T to 2.0 T.\nAs shown in Fig. 5, the speciﬁc total loss increased with\nthe increase of magnetic ﬂux density. Under normal working\nconditions, the saturation magnetic ﬂux density of the trans-\nformer core is around 1.7 T, and the loss data measured by\nthis system can meet the requirements.\nIV. VERIFICATION OF IMPROVED SEPARATION METHOD\nTaking the steel sheet B27R095 and 27ZDKH95 as two\nexamples, the speciﬁc total loss of this kind of steel sheet\nFIGURE 5. Measured results of specific total loss for 30ZH105 and\nB27R095.\nTABLE 2. Calculated results of coefficients for B27R095 and 27ZDKH95.\nTABLE 3. Calculated results of the compensation coefficients for\nB27R095 and 27ZDKH95.\nunder sinusoidal alternating voltage of power frequency and\nmagnetic ﬂux density of 0T-2.0 T were analyzed.\nA. PRELIMINARY CALCULATION\nThe eddy current loss coefﬁcient ke and the eddy current loss\nPe were calculated by (4) and (5), and the relevant parameters\nof B27R095 and 27ZDKH95 are acquired, ke of B27R095 is\n3.27424 ×10−5 and ke of 27ZDKH95 is 3 .24474 ×10−5.\nAfter the total loss minus the eddy current loss Pe, the\nspeciﬁc total loss at 0 T-1.5 T were used to calculate kh, kex,\nα and γ according to (6). The numerical results are listed\nin Table 2.\nB. COEFFICIENT CORRECTION\nThe speciﬁc total loss data in the magnetic ﬂux density range\nof 1.5 T-2.0 T were used to modify the initial calculated\nhysteresis loss and eddy current loss. The values of the\nfour compensation coefﬁcients were calculated by using (7),\nas listed in Table 3.\nThe basic coefﬁcients in Table 2 and Table 3 can be sub-\nstituted into (7) to calculate the loss. Figure 6 shows the\ncalculation results of the hysteresis loss, eddy current loss\nand abnormal loss of B27R095 and 27ZDKH95 silicon steel\nplates by the improved method.\nC. HYSTERESIS LOSS MEASUREMENT\nIn order to verify the accuracy of the method in this article,\nthe hysteresis losses of two types of silicon steel plates,\nB27R095 and 27ZDKH95, were obtained by performing\nthe quasi-static magnetization process with low-frequency\nVOLUME 8, 2020 204851\nH.

Comparison of calculated hysteresis loss of B27R095 and\n27ZDKH95.\nexcitation voltage [30]–[33]. In this experiment, the excita-\ntion voltage frequency was 0.005 Hz, and the core loss of a\nsingle period can be expressed as (10).\nPts =Phs +kesB2\nmf +kcxsBλ\nm f λ−1 (10)\nwhere Pts represents the speciﬁc total loss per unit mass in a\nsingle period; Phs represents the hysteresis loss per unit mass\nin a single period; kesand kexs are the coefﬁcients related to\nthe material.\nAccording to (10), in the excitation process, the hystere-\nsis loss is independent of the frequency. Therefore, at this\nextremely low frequency, the eddy current loss and abnormal\nloss can be ignored compared with the hysteresis loss. That\nis, the hysteresis loop obtained in this way can exclude the\ninﬂuence of other loss terms, and the area of the hysteresis\nloop reﬂects the energy loss in one magnetization cycle.\nTherefore, the hysteresis loss at 50 Hz can be calculated by\nf multiplying the integral of hysteresis loop area, as shown\nin (11):\nPh =f\n∮\nHdB (11)\nwhere H represents the magnetic ﬁeld strength and B repre-\nsents the magnetic ﬂux density.\nFigure 7 shows the comparison of the calculated data of\nB27R095 and 27ZDKH95 silicon steel plates based on the\ntraditional Bertotti method and the improved method and the\nmeasured hysteresis loss data.\nAs can be seen from Fig. 7, although at the low Bm\n(below 1.5 T), the results of the traditional Bertotti model\nwere in good agreement with the experimental measurement\nones. The calculated results were signiﬁcantly smaller than\nthe measured ones when the magnetic ﬂux density reached\nsaturation, and the error expanded with the increase of the\nmagnetic ﬂux density. By contrast, the calculated hysteresis\nloss obtained by the improved method in this article was in\nFIGURE 8. Comparison of specified total loss of B27R095 and 27ZDKH95.\nTABLE 4.

RESULTS OF SPECIFIED TOTAL LOSS CALCULATION\nFigure 8 shows the speciﬁc total loss of B27R095 and\nZDKH95 silicon steel plates obtained by the improved\nmethod, traditional method and experimental measurement.\nIt can be seen that the calculated speciﬁed losses by the\nimproved method of the three items agreed well with the mea-\nsured ones. It effectively solves the problem that the Bertotti\nmodel cannot fully describe the nonlinear characteristics in\nthe high magnetic ﬂux density range. On the contrary, it can\nbe seen that the improved loss separation method proposed in\nthis article is more accurate than the traditional ones.\nIn addition, the basic parameters of 14 common industrial\nsilicon steel sheets were obtained, and the speciﬁc total loss\nwas measured according to the measurement platform set up\nin Section 2. The hysteresis loss was measured by performing\nthe process of quasi-static magnetization with low-frequency\nexcitation voltage.

Liet al.: Improved Loss-Separation Method for Transformer Core Loss Calculation\nFIGURE 10. Specified total loss for laminated core of 27ZDKH95 and\n27ZH95 when using different methods.\nindustrial silicon steel sheets in the calculation of hysteresis\nloss are presented in Table 4, which have reference value\nfor the selection of initial values of other types of industrial\nsilicon steel sheets. For the convenience of comparison, ﬁve\nsigniﬁcant digits are taken for the data. The reader can use the\nimproved loss separation method to obtain the approximate\nvalues of hysteresis loss, eddy current loss and speciﬁc loss\nof other types of silicon steel according to the veriﬁcation\nprocess in part IV .\nV. APPLICATION\nAt present, the transformer core is mainly composed of\noriented silicon steel sheet which is laminated by step\nlap. In this article, two industrial oriented silicon steel\nplates, 27ZDKH95 and 27ZH95, were selected to build a\nproduction-level transformer core model according to the\nactual industrial design standards, and the application and\nuniversality of the improved method proposed in this article\nwere veriﬁed on these two core models. It should be pointed\nout that the size of the production-level transformer core\nmodel is close to the ﬁrst-level size of an actual distribution\ntransformer core in the power system, so it is considered that\nthe main characteristics of actual transformer cores can be\neffectively reﬂected.\nAccording to the improved loss separation method, the loss\nseparation of the production-level laminated core model\nof 27ZDKH95 and 27ZH95 were studied. The calculated\nresults of the eddy current loss, hysteresis loss and abnormal\nloss of the two types of silicon steel plates are shown in Fig. 9.\nFigure 10 shows the comparison of the calculated results\nof speciﬁc total loss by the improved method and Bertotti\nmethod and the measured data of the laminated core model\nmade of 27ZDKH95 and 27ZH95 silicon steel under sinu-\nsoidal excitation of power frequency.\nAs shown in Fig. 10, when the loss separation calculation\nwas applied, the difference between the calculated value of\nspeciﬁc total loss obtained by the Bertotti method and the\nexperimental value became larger with the increase of mag-\nnetic ﬂux density, while the results obtained by the improved\nmethod proposed in this article were in good agreement with\nthe measured ones in the whole magnetic ﬂux density range.\nTherefore, through the calculation and veriﬁcation of the\nproduction-level laminated core model, the improved method\nis proved to have the ability of describing the nonlinear\ncharacteristics of the core better and maintaining high accu-\nracy in both low and high magnetic ﬂux density ranges.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nIn this article, two traditional loss separation methods based\non the Bertotti model were analyzed, and the calculated val-\nues of the traditional models had a large deviation from the\nexperimental ones. By comparison and analysis, it was found\nthat the inﬂuence of core oversaturation in high magnetic ﬂux\ndensity range on the loss should be taken into account. In view\nof this, we proposed an improved loss separation method for\ncore loss separation based on the traditional Bertotti model.\nIn addition, by using the Epstein frame experiment platform,\n14 types of commonly used industrial silicon steel plates were\nmeasured to obtain the experimental data of total loss and\nhysteresis loss. Through case veriﬁcation, the effectivity of\nthe improved method was proved which performed well in\na wide magnetic ﬂux density range for the core loss separa-\ntion. In addition, the superiority in precision over traditional\nmethods was conﬁrmed by result comparison. Furthermore,\nthe improved method was also applied on a product-level\nlaminated core, and the results further veriﬁed our method.\nMoreover, the suggested coefﬁcient values of 14 kinds of\ncommon industrial silicon steel as well as the value range of\nthe proposed initial ﬁtting value were given, which provides\na reference for the loss prediction of other types of steel\nsheet, and also provides reliable data support for the accurate\ncalculation of core loss for the transformer material selection.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to thank Tunkia Company Ltd.,\nChangsha, China, for the equipment support.\nREFERENCES\n[1] G.
