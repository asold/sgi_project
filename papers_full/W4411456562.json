    "abstract": "Existing approaches to the automatic annotation of classical Chinese poetry often fail to generate precise source citations and depend heavily on manual segmentation, limiting their scalability and accuracy. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel paradigm that integrates dictionary retrieval with retrieval-augmented large language model enhancements for automatic poetic annotation. Our method leverages the contextual understanding capabilities of large models to dynamically select appropriate lexical senses and employs an automated segmentation technique to minimize reliance on manual splitting. For poetic segments absent from standard dictionaries, the system retrieves pertinent information from a domain-specific knowledge base and generates definitions grounded in this auxiliary data, thereby substantially improving both annotation accuracy and coverage. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms general-purpose large language models and pre-trained classical Chinese language models on automatic annotation tasks; notably, it achieves a micro-averaged accuracy of 94.33% on key semantic segments. By delivering more precise and comprehensive annotations, this framework advances the computational analysis of classical Chinese poetry and offers significant potential for intelligent teaching applications and digital humanities research.",
