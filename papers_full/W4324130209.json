The Journal advises authors\nusing such LLMs to clearly mention their use either in the\n‘Methods’ section, or as an ‘Acknowledgement,’ inclu-ding\nthe name of the LLM and the version used.\nAdditional guidance will be developed and communi-\ncated, as this field expands. The day is not far when it\nbecomes the norm for journals to check for LLMs use for\nall manuscripts, as it is done for plagiarism/text-similarity\nnowadays.\nFunding: None; Competing interests: None.\nDEVENDRA MISHRA\nEditor-in-Chief,\nIndian Pediatrics.\n ip.editor@iapindia.org\nREFERENCES\n1.

Available from:\nhttps://www.zdnet.com/article/best-ai-chatbot/\nT\nhe effect of AI-enabled large language models\n(LLMs), most visibly ChatGPT ( https://\nopenai.com/blog/chatgpt/), on the scientific\nand educational world has been truly disrup-\ntive. Leading publishing groups like the Nature group [1]\nand JAMA group of journals [2] have come out with\nstatements on journal policies regarding their use. The\nWorld Association of Medical Editors has also come out\nwith its recommendations on chatbots in relation to scho-\nlarly publications [3]. The recent news of ChatGPT per-\nforming at or near the passing threshold for all three\nexams of the United States Medical Licensing Exami-\nnation (USMLE) will probably create another outcry [4].\nWith LLMs demonstrating their ability all the way from\nthe entrance to the medical profession (entrance exams)\nto the near peak of the academic achievement i.e., publi-\nshing in a respectable journal, academic clinicians may\nstart to feel threatened.\nNewer LLMs will continue to be developed [5], and\nwill continue to improve with more people using them,\nand that is a welcome development. The progress of\nscience and technology can neither be curtailed, nor\nshould it be. Experts have already pointed out multiple\nshort-comings of such programs [2], and other AI tools to\ndelete their clandestine use are also on the horizon\n(https://gptzero.me/), which is likely to lead to a more\nethical and regulated use of such technology.\nThe editors of Indian Pediatrics have discussed this\nissue. We feel that using ChatGPT or other LLMs for writing\nparts of a biomedical paper should not be prohi-bited,\nindeed it may even be advantageous to researchers from\nmany low and middle-income countries, for whom English is\na second language, and who wish to submit papers to\nFFFFF RRRRR OOOOO M M M M M TTTTT HHHHH E E E E E EEEEE DDDDD IIIII TTTTT OOOOO R'S R'S R'S R'S R'S DDDDD EEEEE SSSSS KKKKK",
