T he positive and n egative \nproperties of the esters were described on the basis of a comparison with the most popular insulating \nliquid like mineral oil.

Conclusions from the analysis \nindicate that the wide knowledge about ester properties is necessary to correct design process and to \nproper exploitation of the power transformers filled in esters. \n \nKey Words: Power transformers, insulating fluids, environmental protection, high voltages \n \nIntroduction \nPower t ransformers a re the one  of  the m ost i mportant c omponents of  e lectrical pow er system \nserving the transmission and distribution of electricity in the high voltage three-phase electrical power \ngrids a nd f rom t hese g rids t o t he l ow v oltage g rids. F rom t his r eason, t he transformers a re t he \nubiquitous in the human environment. Generally, the transformers are not the devices that generate \nparticularly t roublesome e nvironmental pr oblems. H owever, t aking i nto a ccount t he co ntemporary \ntransformation o f publ ic a wareness, f orcing t he pr o-ecological look o n t he ea ch t echnical d evice, \nespecially on it, that appears in large number of units in the human environment, it should be searched \nalso for power transformers some new solutions, which improve their ecological properties (Kycior K. \n2007, Mosinski F. 2009). A significant majority of the total number of transformers, produced in all \nranges o f v oltage an d power, a re the o il power transformers. The so -called d ry t ransformers ( with \nresin insulation) are the margin of exploited units. Therefore, in the assessment of environmental risks \nconnected with the transformer in service, the mineral oil is the most important element to be taken \ninto consideration. Of course, the aspects such as the risk of electric shock, noise and vibration as well \nas energy and power losses are also important, but taking into account the effects for the environment \nfrom these types of interactions, these, connected with mineral oil, seem t o be the most dangerous \n(Kucharska A. 2007, Mosinski F. 2009). \nMineral oil is a mixture of different kinds of hydrocarbon compounds (naphtenic CnH2n, such as \ncyclohexane C 6H12, pa raffin C nH2n+2, s uch a s he xane C 6H14, a nd a romatic C nHn, s uch a s be nzene \nC6H6). The proportions of the contents of the individual components depend on the composition of the \nstarting pe troleum a nd, f or e xample, most pr ized na phthenic transformer oi ls c an be  obt ained onl y \nwith the certain types of petroleum. Therefore, in the case of spillage of oil to the environment, the oil \nis not  a  ne utral f or it. A dditionally i ts a mount ( exemplary i n t he oi l pow er t ransformer ha ving t he \nnominal voltage 110 kV the mass of oil is about 7-8 thousand kilograms, while in the transformer 400 \nkV su ch m ass i s n early 8 0 thousand k ilograms) i ntensifies the h azard. C ommonly us ed mineral \ntransformer oil has an ecological threat index twice higher than water, but it concerns the fresh oil \nwithout a ny pol ychlorobiphenyls a dmixtures ( PCBs). T he a ged o ils (those derived f rom t he l ong-\noperated transformers) m ay, how ever, c ontain s ignificant qu antities of  p olycyclic a romatic \ncompounds (benzene, toluene, xylene), which have a carcinogenic properties. Ecological threat index \ncan t hen be increased up to the three times i n comparison with fresh oil. Generally, i n the case of \ntransformer failure, the mineral oil leaked to the soil may be the source of its contamination \n(degradation of oil-soaked layer), and in consequence also the contamination of water bodies and flora \n1st Annual International Interdisciplinary Conference, AIIC 2013, 24-26 April, Azores, Portugal               - Proceedings-  \n359 \nand fauna, which is in the area of contaminated space. Due to the relatively high solubility in water, \nthe hydrocarbon compounds can migrate with infiltrating rainwater by the aeration zone to the first \naquifer. For example, 1 kg of the waste oil that has leaked from the transformer to the water reservoir \nmakes i t un fits to dr ink i n t he v olume of  5 million l iters ( Kucharska A . 200 7, Mosinski F . 2009 ). \nNumerically, the measure of a potential contamination of the given fluid is determined by the level of \nits b iodegradability. F or m ineral oil, t his factor i s v ery l ow, a nd in a ccordance t o t he O ECD 301  \nstandard, is only 10%. It means that after 28 days from the entering the oil to the environment, only \nsuch s mall pa rt of  this f luid s urrenders t o s elf de gradation. T hus, t he f ailures c oncerning t he oi l \nleakage are undoubtly harmful to the environment (air, water, soil), and the costs of removing their \neffects ar e u sually v ery l arge. P revent t hem o r l imitation t heir effects, a lthough ex pensive, h as a n \nimportance meaning for the environment. It is believed that this role is fulfilled by the special place \nwith the pans for leaking oil, by the systems of oil and water separation, and by the monitoring of the \ntransformer and its equipment (Mosinski F. 2009, Rozga P., Skowron A., 2012). The example of the \noil pan installation is shown in Fig. 1. \n \nFig. 1. Example of the oil pan installation. \n \nThe volume of designed and built oil pans should be sufficient to bring all of the oil contained in \nthe transformer. In the cases where the transformers are equipped additionally with the water sprinkler \nsystems, the volume of the pan is increased by an additional 10-20%. \nMentioned on t he be ginning of  t his c hapter t he pr oblem of  P CBs i s now  ge nerally margin. \nCurrently u sed transformer o ils m eet t he c riteria f or the P CB co ntent, w hich, i n ac cordance t o t he \nspecified requirements, should be less than 50 ppm (Kaminska A. 2007). \nAnother problem of environmental nature is the combustibility of mineral oil due to its relatively \nlow flash point. Combustion products of mineral oil being the result of its ignition occurred because \nof transformer failure (e.g. short circuit), are considered to be dangerous and cause air pollution. 1000 \nkg of burnt, under unfavorable conditions, mineral oil emits circa 10 kg of harmful substances to the \natmosphere. Additionally, the side product accompanying the mineral oil combustion is the dense and \nvery black smoke (Fig. 2). \n \nFig. 2. Example of transformer failure with fire \n \nTherefore, one of the pro-ecological solution, which is connected directly with the use of mineral \noil in pow er transformers, i s to r eplace it by a  ne w e nvironmentally f riendly i nsulating l iquids \nproduced on the ba sis of  na tural and s ynthetic e sters, w hich importantly d ecrease t he n egative \ninfluence of the transformer on the environment (Oommen T. V., Clairborne C. C., Mullen J. T. 1997, \nBorsi H., Gockenbach E. 2005, M artins M. A. G. 2010). Such alternative is necessary, especially in \n\n1st Annual International Interdisciplinary Conference, AIIC 2013, 24-26 April, Azores, Portugal               - Proceedings-  \n360 \nthe areas having highly restricted regulations concerning the environmental protection and fire \nprevention. The pro-ecological l iquids, f rom the e nvironmental protection poi nt of view, a re \ncharacterized by the high level of biodegradability reaching even 95%, and from the fire prevention \npoint of view, have the significantly higher than mineral oil flash point (above 300 OC to circa 140 OC \ncharacterizing the mineral oil). \nIt is however important, that in spite of the good ecological properties of esters, they can bring \nmany pr oblems, esp ecially i n t he p hase o f d esign a nd m anufacture o f t ransformers, w hat r esulted \nfrom the short time of existing the esters on the transformer market, and incomplete knowledge in this \nfield. Therefore, the pr operties of  ne w, e nvironmentally f riendly electro-insulating liq uids w ill b e \npresented in comparison to the analogical properties of mineral oil. The comparison will be based on \nthe fundamental experimental studies (also author’s).The similarities (mainly in the field of electrical \nstrength) and the differences (in the behavior of liquids in the heating process, in the field of lightning \nstrength, in the field of chemical parameters) will be presented and critically discussed. \nThe problem of using biodegradable liquids in power transformers \nEnvironmentally f riendly in sulating f luids, w hich a re a n a lternative to  m ineral o ils, a re th e \nsynthetic es ters an d n atural es ters, f or w hich the b ase ar e v egetable o ils p roduced f rom can ola, \nsoybean, corn etc. In Fig. 3, the molecular structures of two commercial dielectric liquids - natural \nand synthetic ester are shown.  \n \nFig. 3. The chemical structures of synthetic ester (a) and natural ester (b); R, R’, R’’ – organic groups. \n \nBoth liquids have been more than ten years in the test phase, and prototype units filled by these \nfluids are with nominal voltages up to 238 k V and above 100 M VA in capacity. Natural ester is an \nester based on soybean oil. The major molecular component of this ester is mixed triglyceride built \nfrom t he g lycerol m olecule an d t hree m olecules o f l ong ch ain f atty aci ds l inked t ogether b y est er \nbonds. In a one triglyceride molecule may be a variety saturated and unsaturated fatty acids consisting \neven f rom t he 22 carbon atoms i n the c hain. The synthetic e ster is a n organic s ynthetic c hemical \ncompound - pentaerythritol ester, which consists of four ester groups -COOR which are at the end of \nthe cross structure of the compound, and in which the organic groups R may be either the same or \ndifferent. \nIn the Table 1, the basic physico-chemical and dielectric parameters for both esters and mineral \noil are summarized (FR3 Data Sheet 2008, Midel 7131 Data Sheet 2010). These parameters concern \nthe fresh fluids as received by the manufacturers, without the use of any treatment. \nTable 1.

For \nboth of esters, their biodegradability is significantly higher than mineral oil, what confirms the better \necological properties of these liquids. Taking into account that after 28 days both of esters decay in \nabove 60% , a ccording t o the O ECD 301 s tandard, they c an be  a dmitted as a  biodegradable. Thus, \nusing esters in the places having restricted environmental regulations is not a problem. It is important \nto notice, that in the case of esters it is not necessary to use the oil pans, what finally reduces the costs \nof installation of the transformers. \n      The s econd o f t he m entioned p arameters – flash poi nt – also sp ecifies t he es ters as t he \nenvironmentally friendly liquids. Performed for the all three insulating fluids the test of “open burner” \nindicates on the flash temperatures identical as determined by the manufacturers in the data sheets. \nFor the mineral oil the temperature, after delivered the open fire from the acetyl burner, rose violently \nand after 4 minutes the ignition of mineral oil took place in the temperature of about 130 OC. Then the \noil burned without the open fire and during the combustion process emitted the dense black smoke. \nWhereas in the case of ester fluids the temperature rose slower and after the 70 minutes the process \nwas stopped because the ignition did not occur and the temperature reached nearly 300 OC. The better \nproperties of esters are also visible looking at the intensity of the smoke emitted by the burned liquids. \nIn the case of mineral oil smoke is black and very dense while for the both esters smoke is emitted in \nthe sm aller am ounts an d i ts d ense i s al so m uch l ower. I n p ercentages, t he v olume o f w aste g ases \nemitted by the burned esters in relation to the gases emitted by burned mineral oil is only about 15%. \nFrom the insulating properties point of view the most important parameter is breakdown voltage. \nThis voltage, a ccording t o t he IEC 60156 s tandard, is de termined by t he i ntroduction of t he liquid \nsample t o the sp ecial apparatus w ith p rofiled m etal e lectrodes creating t he u niform el ectrical f ield \ndistribution a nd t hen subject to the rising e lectrical field resulting from t he A C voltage increasing. \nThe av erage v alue o f si x b reakdowns o ccurring i n t he sp ecified co nditions i s t aken as an  A C \nbreakdown voltage. Of course, the value of breakdown voltage depends on the quality of tested liquid \n(water and impurities content), so in order to compare the values of breakdown voltages of different \ndielectric liquids, they should have the similar quality (Li J., Grzybowski S., Sun Y., Chen X., 2007, \nDang Viet-Nung, Beroual A., Perrier C. 2011). In the Fig. 4, t he results of the measurements of AC \nbreakdown v oltage ar e p resented. These r esults co nfirm i dentical p roperties co nnected w ith t he \nelectrical strength of synthetic ester, natural ester and mineral oil. \n \nFig. 4. AC breakdown voltage for different types of insulating liquids measured according to  the IEC 60156 \nstandard. \n \nLooking at  t he i nfluence of moisture content on t he electrical strength, the esters b ehave more \nfavorable. It is because the esters are characterized by the constant value of breakdown voltage apart \nfrom t he moisture c ontent up t o 600 ppm  ( Martins 2010, D ang V iet-Nung, B eroual A ., P errier C . \n2011). For the mineral oil, its strength goes down even at the small increasing of moisture (at 20 ppm \nthe breakdown voltage is only 40 kV while for good conditioned oil this value is in the range of 65-75 \nkV). \n\n1st Annual International Interdisciplinary Conference, AIIC 2013, 24-26 April, Azores, Portugal               - Proceedings-  \n362 \nSimilarly other parameter characterizing the dielectric properties of the liquids, that is the \nelectrical p ermittivity, a lso in dicates o n the p ossibility o f b etter using th e e sters in  the insulating \nsystems o f p ower transformers. T he insulating sy stems o f t he t ransformer w indings ar e u sually a \ncombination of electro-insulating fluid and solid insulating materials like paper or transformerboard. \nThese systems are series, series-parallel or parallel. In the series systems, which are the most often \nsystems in the transformers, the distribution of the stresses is inversely proportional to the electrical \npermittivity of the materials created it. The system has a higher strength if the more uniform stress \ndistribution is. The higher value of electrical permittivity of the esters (3.1-3.2) than the mineral oil \n(2.2) t hus influences profitable on t he st ress d istribution in t he sy stem: electro-insulating fluid – \ncellulose (electrical permittivity of cellulose is 4). \nAlthough there are many positive properties of the biodegradable esters concerning the electrical \nstrength at AC voltage, their lightning strength, that is the strength for a short voltage pulses having \nsteep front (1.2 µs) and long back (50 µs), is not as good as in the case of mineral oil. The studies on \nthe m echanism of  i nitiation a nd pr opagation o f e lectrical di scharges de veloping unde r a bove \nmentioned lightning pulses indicated that only at inception voltage or at the 50% breakdown voltage, \nthe discharges developing in the same way independently on the type of dielectric liquids. When the \nvoltage increases, thus, when the voltage multiplicity in relation to the 50% breakdown voltage rises, \nthe discharges, both in the natural and synthetic esters stands more energetic and at the lower than in \nthe case of mineral oil overvoltages, the developing of discharges in esters is determined by liquid \nphase i onization. Mo re e nergetic d ischarges a re m ore dangerous f or the s olid i nsulation of t he \ntransformer ( paper a nd transformerboard) causing i ts da mage i n t he form of  l ocal c arbonization. \nTherefore, when the one of the esters is used as an insulating medium, it is indicated, for the sake of \nlightning strength, using the wider insulating gaps in the transformer. It is particularly important in the \ncase of big transformer units having the rated voltages equal or higher than 110 kV (Tran Duy C., \nLesaint O., Denat A., Bonifaci N. 2009, Liu Q., Wang Z. D. 2011). \nOne of the negative properties of the esters, but without any direct influence on the possibility of \nusing esters in power transformers, is the susceptibility on the action of concentrated heat flux (Rozga \nP., Skowron A. 2012). This property was observed during the process of preparing of the esters for the \nfilling the transformer, and then confirmed by the laboratory measurements. The experimental studies \nindicated t hat t he i nfluence o f t he h eating el ements, u sed i n t he h eating p rocess o f t he es ters, \ndetermined b y t he unitary su rface l oad ex pressed i n W/ cm2, cau ses the g rowth o f the d ielectric \ndissipation factor tgδ of the esters. This growth, at the value of unitary surface load identically as used \nduring t he heating pr ocess of  t he mineral oil ( 2 W/cm2), i s such meaningful, that tgδ of the esters \nexceeds the boundary values determined in the standards although the fluids were not exploited. The \nexemplary curve presenting the dependence of the tgδ versus unitary surface load for synthetic ester, \nperformed during experimental works, was shown in Fig. 4. \n \nFig. 5. Dependence of dielectric dissipation factor versus unitary surface load for a synthetic ester. \n \nThe described phenomena do not concern mineral oil. Its treatment does not change the dielectric \nproperties of mineral oil. The differences in the different behavior of esters and mineral oil result from \nthe di fferent phy sico-chemical pr operties, w hich d irectly i nfluence on  t he p henomena oc curring \nduring the heating. In the case of mineral oil, the laminar flow of the oil, because of its relative low \ndensity a nd f irst o f a ll l ow v iscosity, is  r elatively f ast. Thanks to  it,  the o il r eminds in  th e d irect \ncontact w ith the su rface of the h eater o nly b y t he sh ort t ime. I n t he c ase of e sters, w hich are \ncharacterized by the much higher density and viscosity, contact with the surface of the heater is much \nlonger. It causes that the layers of the liquids “stick” to the surface of the heater and their overheating \n\n1st Annual International Interdisciplinary Conference, AIIC 2013, 24-26 April, Azores, Portugal               - Proceedings-  \n363 \ntaking effect of disintegration and decomposition of molecular bonds. Finally, in the liquid volume \nthe polar particles appear and g rowth o f ab ove m entioned d ielectric d issipation f actor takes p lace. \nTaking into account the large experience in the filed of mineral oil treatment and lack of precisely \ndefined parameters of the heating process of the esters, the presented problem is quite significant from \nthe production phase point of view. For the esters the production process becomes lengthen because \nsimilar heating conditions as for mineral oil is not possible to keep. \nThe higher density and first of all the higher kinematic viscosity of the esters is also important at \nthe c onsideration o f t heir influence on the t ransformer c ooling c onditions. G enerally, t he w orking \ntransformer generates the energy losses. These losses are in the windings, in the magnetic core and in \nthe metal elements of the construction. The losses transform in the heat, what causes the heating of the \nindividual parts of transformer. The requirement for the good work of transformer is the effective heat \nabstraction outside it. The mechanism of the heat abstraction looks as following: the heat arising in \nthe individual internal parts o f t ransformer g ets o ut of its ( heat c onduction); from w here w ith the \nusage o f t he co oling m edium ( electro-insulating f luid) i s d irectly o r indirectly car ried away t o the \nsurroundings. The higher kinematic viscosity of the insulating fluids is, the better the cooling function \nis fulfilled. Additionally, the kinematic viscosity, both for esters and for mineral oil, depends on the \ntemperature, what was presented in Fig. 5. However, the mineral oil has a viscosity much lower and \nbecause of  i t, i t s eems t o not ice t hat m ineral oi l f ulfils be tter t he c ooling f unctions i n the pow er \ntransformer than biodegradable esters. \n \nFig. 5.

Flowing ester cannot reach all fragments of the insulating systems of transformer \nwindings. Thus, the construction of insulating system of power transformer filled by ester should take \ninto account its physico-chemical properties in order to provide the correct circulation of the cooling \nfluid both in the natural and forced circulation. Hence the systems forcing the liquid circulation in the \ntransformer filled by ester should be characterized by higher power, and the oil channels should be \nwider than in the case of transformer with mineral oil (Hulshorst W.T.J., Groeman J.F. 2002, Pukel G. \nJ. 2009, Martins M. A. G. 2010). \nConclusion \nBiodegradable synthetic and natural esters are the good alternative for mineral oil, especially in \nthe situations when the power transformer has to be installed in the places for which the restricted \nenvironmental r egulations ar e specified. N ext to t he m any p ositive asp ects like t he h igher \nbiodegradability, hi gh flash poi nt and good properties co ncerning t he A C electrical strength, esters \nhave also negative features, which should be taken into account in the design phase and during the \nexploitation of the transformer with esters. The parameters of the designed transformer must be based \non the knowledge about these negative features. Designer should know that the esters are susceptible \nto the action of a concentrated heat flux, have the worse cooling properties than mineral oil, and lower \nlightning strength. The final product – power transformer filled by ester – will be in effect the more \nexpensive de vice, but  t aking i nto c onsideration t he pr o-ecological t endencies r eigned on t he \n\n1st Annual International Interdisciplinary Conference, AIIC 2013, 24-26 April, Azores, Portugal               - Proceedings-  \n364 \ntransformer m arket a nd s till i ncreasing de mand f or new e nvironmentally f riendly pr oducts, i n t he \nfeature the cost will be certainly lower. \n \nReferences: \nBorsi H., Gockenbach E., Properties of ester liquid Midel 7131 as an alternative liquid to mineral oil \nfor transformers.
