This escalating\nepidemic underscores the importance of developing effective\nmanagement strategies to mitigate its impact on individuals and\nsocieties, particularly by addressing the significant burden of\ndiabetes complications.\nAchieving diabetes remission can reduce the risk of these\ncomplications, and obtaining diabetes self-management\neducation (DSME) and medical nutrition therapy (MNT) is\ncrucial in attaining this goal [3,4]. Clinical research has shown\nthat digital tools aimed to provide DSME and MNT can\nsignificantly lower patients’ hemoglobin A1c levels [5].\nPrograms providing access to conversation with remote\nclinicians are more effective than digital tools that only provide\nregular educational articles but have limited scalability [6]. The\nsituation is particularly concerning in China, as the country\nfaces a rapidly growing population with T2DM and a severe\nshortage of clinical nutritionists. With only 0.03 clinical\nnutritionists per 1000 population, China has few experts in this\nfield and requires a standardized training system [7].\nConsequently, the majority of patients with T2DM receive only\nbasic oral hypoglycemic treatments, which may not be sufficient\nfor optimal disease management or the prevention of\ncomplications [8]. A digital solution that can provide DSME\nand MNT similar to a remote nutritionist at scale is desired.\nAdvanced large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, a type\nof artificial intelligence (AI), can present medical information\nin a detailed and explicit manner through interactive dialogues,\ndemonstrating great potential for development in the medical\nfield [9]. They have already shown their potential in medical\nwriting and education [10,11]. The process of food logging is\na pivotal component in nutritional management [12]. The ability\nto accomplish this task without manual input and deliver instant\ndietary feedback would significantly advance and likely increase\npatient engagement. A proficient medical system based on a\nmultilabel image classification model, capable of\ningredient-level identification and providing ingredient-level\nnutrition knowledge, could expediently streamline the food\nlogging process and make it more educational. By harnessing\nthe power of LLM and image recognition technology, an AI\nnutritionist program can be created to assist in managing T2DM\nat scale.\nBefore implementing the AI nutritionist program in clinical\nsettings, conducting a preclinical concept validation study is\ncrucial to ensure its effectiveness and reliability. In this study,\nour efforts included extensive surveys, performance evaluations,\nexpert assessments, and comparisons with existing models and\nbest practices. We surveyed patients with T2DM and\nendocrinologists in hospitals to assess their dietary knowledge\nand identify areas where the AI nutritionist program can provide\ntargeted support. Our assessment of ChatGPT’s capabilities\nincluded having it participate in the Chinese Registered Dietitian\nexamination, which was a rigorous test of its ability to provide\nevidence-based dietary advice. To gauge its proficiency in\nanswering open-ended questions about MNT, we enlisted the\nexpertise of professionals to compare ChatGPT’s responses\nwith those of experts. In addition, we scrutinized the model’s\nfood recommendations for adherence to best practices and\nconsistency with expert recommendations. To mimic how\npatients interact with their nutritionists, we developed a deep\nlearning–based image recognition model for food identification\nat the ingredient level. We compared its performance with\nexisting open-source models to ensure accuracy and reliability.\nWe developed a user-friendly app that combines the capabilities\nof LLMs and image recognition models, hoping to improve the\nquality of care for patients with T2DM in China and beyond.\nMethods\nSurvey Study: Patients With T2DM and Practitioners\nTo assess the nutritional management status of patients with\nT2DM, we conducted an electronic questionnaire survey\ninvolving patients and doctors. The questionnaire was designed\nto address patients’ lifestyle habits and dietary cognition,\nincluding basic information (eg, height, age, gender, weight,\nand level of medical-related education), lifestyle habits (eg,\nfrequency and duration of weekly exercise), dietary therapy\ncognition (eg, selection of common foods), and evaluation of\nmedical quality in terms of dietary therapy (eg, doctor-patient\ncommunication, available medical resources, and expectations).\nThe survey was conducted electronically and disseminated via\nQR codes by the researchers from May 1, 2023, to May 16,\n2023. The location was the Endocrinology Department of Peking\nUniversity Shenzhen Hospital. The specific inclusion criteria\nwere as follows:\n• Patients: we selected outpatients, excluding those with type\n1 diabetes caused by hereditary factors. The study also\nincluded patients in the prediabetic stage of T2DM. They\nwere aged 18 and older, with no cognitive impairments.\n• Clinical doctors: those from the Endocrinology Department\nwith more than 10 years of clinical practice were included.\nEthics Approval\nThe research procedure complied with the national legislation\nand local guidelines in China and was approved by the Ethics\nCommittee of Peking University Shenzhen Hospital\n(PUSH2023069).\nJ Med Internet Res 2023 | vol. 25 | e51300 | p. 2https://www.jmir.org/2023/1/e51300\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nSun et alJOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH\nXSL•FO\nRenderX\nChatGPT Evaluation\nTo systematically assess the expertise of ChatGPT in dietary\ntherapy, we conducted a systematic evaluation from the\nperspective of nutrition and the most challenging ketogenic diet.\nWe asked all questions in Chinese and translated the results into\nEnglish for presentation.\nAssessment of Nutritional Knowledge\nUsing the actual registered dietitian exam questions released\nfrom the official exam guide in China, we assessed ChatGPT’s\nmastery of professional nutritional knowledge [13]. A complete\nexam consists of 200 questions, divided into the following four\nparts: (1) Food and Nutrition, mainly involving basic nutritional\nconcepts, food nutrition, food science, and hygiene; (2)\nIndividual and Group Nutrition Management, including basic\nmedical knowledge, nutritional assessment and intervention,\ndietary applications for different categories of people, and issues\nrelated to disease nutrition; (3) Public Nutrition and Nutrition\nEducation, mainly involving some standards and regulations\nissued by the Chinese government, nutritional surveys and\neducation, community nutrition and chronic disease\nmanagement, environment, and health; and (4) Dietary\nManagement, including meal pairing design, production, and\nhygiene monitoring. The official guide divided the questions\ninto 3 difficulty levels: level A (simple questions testing the\nmastery of common theoretical knowledge), level B (general\nquestions testing the ability to think using theoretical\nknowledge), and level C (difficult questions testing the ability\nto analyze more complex situations using theoretical knowledge\nor the ability to connect theory with practice). We copied the\nquestions verbatim as input into ChatGPT and recorded the\nanswers. Finally, the results were calculated for accuracy for\neach question answered incorrectly. We examined and labeled\nthe errors made in the answers as one of the following: logical\nerror (the response found the information necessary but did not\nreason it into the correct answer), information error (the response\nused wrong external information or did not identify the critical\ninformation in the question stem), and statistical error (the\nresponse made a calculation mistake or an incorrect estimation)\n[14]. Three different authors reviewed the labels and reconciled\nuncertain labels.\nAssessment of Common Ingredients and Basic\nKnowledge of the Ketogenic Diet\nBased on the current dietary status of residents in China, we\ncollected 95 common ingredients and beverages, classified as\nmeat, seafood, eggs, vegetables, cooking oils, soy products,\ndairy products, fungi and algae, nuts, fruits, starches, high-sugar\nfoods, beverages, and alcohol. We prompted ChatGPT about\nthem in the format: “Would you recommend eating (food) under\nthe conditions of a ketogenic diet?” The results were then\nrecorded and organized. We organized the food\nrecommendations by the Low Carbon Diet Association in China\nfor the mentioned ingredients and beverages within the context\nof a ketogenic diet. We then compared these recommendations\nwith those generated by ChatGPT [15].\nWe selected 28 common questions about ketogenic diet therapy\ninvolving basic concepts, diet execution, and adverse reactions.\nWe asked ChatGPT these questions, collected the answers, and\njuxtaposed them with expert opinions from the Chinese Low\nCarbon Diet Association for reference [15]. The answer pairs\n(the answers by ChatGPT and the answers by the experts from\nthe Chinese Low Carbon Diet Association) were provided to 6\nclinical nutrition experts (with over 20 years of clinical work\nand senior professional titles) for evaluation. The evaluation\nwas set at three levels, as follows: (1) unacceptable (the answer\nhas professional loopholes, major language problems, and is\noverall unacceptable); (2) acceptable (the answer is somewhat\nprofessional or some parts are challenging to understand, but\noverall, it is acceptable); and (3) excellent (the answer is\nprofessional, logical, readable, and easy to understand). We\nrecorded the expert evaluations through an electronic\nquestionnaire.\nEstablishment and Evaluation of a Multilabel Image\nRecognition Model\nData Set and Preprocessing\nBecause the open-source ingredient recognition data\nset—Recipe1M—is derived from Western cooking websites,\nmany commonly used Chinese ingredients, such as lotus root\nand Chinese yam, are not included [16]. To address this\nlimitation, we scraped 218,663 recipes from a Chinese cooking\nwebsite [17], each containing an image and a list of ingredients.\nWe constructed a separate data set for 11 common\ncarbohydrate-containing ingredients in our study based on these\nrecipes. They include noodles, spaghetti, rice, soybean, squash,\ncarrot, onion, corn, potato, sweet potato, and peanut. Each\ningredient data set contained approximately 3000-5000 images.\nAfter data cleaning, we divided the remaining images into\ntraining, testing, and validation sets, with each of the testing\nand validation sets comprising 20% of both the positive and\nnegative image classes.\nIn the data preprocessing stage, we resized images to 256×256\npixels, center-cropped them to 224×224 pixels, converted them\nto tensors, and normalized them using ImageNet’s mean and\nSD values. The PyTorch (version 1.12.0; Meta AI) framework\nwas used for implementation [18].\nModel Structure and Training Process\nOur model consisted of 2 parts: we used Dino V2 as a backbone\nfeature extractor and built downstream classification heads for\neach ingredient (Figure 1C). Dino V2, currently in the preprint\nstage, is a computer vision model based on Vision Transformer\n(ViT) [19]. It was trained using self-supervised learning and\nhas been open-sourced by Meta. It does not require fine-tuning\nand can learn from any collection of images. It produces robust\nvisual features that can be directly used as inputs for simple\nlinear classifiers [20]. We used the variant “Dino V2_vitl14”\nof the Dino V2 model, a ViT-centric model, which\ncompartmentalizes the input image into 256 distinct patches.\nMoreover, it uses 16 heads for multihead attention alongside\n24 transformer blocks, ultimately yielding an output\nencompassing 1024 distinctive features (Figure 1A). Using\nDinoV2 as a backbone, we trained a custom neural network\nmodel with 3 fully connected layers and ReLU activation\nfunctions for each ingredient. The model has a dropout rate of\nJ Med Internet Res 2023 | vol. 25 | e51300 | p. 3https://www.jmir.org/2023/1/e51300\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nSun et alJOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH\nXSL•FO\nRenderX\n0.2 for regularization. The feature size was set to 1024 to align\nwith Dino V2’s output, and the output size of the final layer\nwas 2 (Figure 1B). We used the cross-entropy loss as the loss\nfunction and the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001\nfor training; we set the number of training epochs to 100 and\nthe batch size to 32 for the training process. The model reaching\nthe highest accuracy on the testing set was saved for evaluation\n(Figure 1D).\nFigure 1. Visualization of the model structure for ingredient recognition. (A) Detailed structure of Dino V2 backbone. (B) Structure of the classification\nhead for a single label. (C) Workflow of the layered multilabel classification model. (D) Workflow of data processing and the multilabel image\nclassification model development. MLP: multilayer perception; ViT: vision transformer.\nModel Evaluation and Benchmark\nWe assessed the performance of the best model by using the F1\nscore on the validation set. The F1 metric represents the\nharmonic mean of precision and recall, making it suitable for\nevaluating classification problems, as it balances false positives\nand false negatives. We used the scikit-learn library in Python\nto calculate the F1 score [21].\nNext, we adopted the inverse cooking model, open-sourced by\nMeta in 2019, as our baseline for comparison with our multilabel\ningredient recognition model [22]. Inverse cooking is a method\nfor generating cooking recipes from food images. It uses a novel\narchitecture to predict ingredients as sets and then generates\ncooking instructions by attending to both the image and the\ninferred ingredients. To fairly evaluate the performance of our\nmodel, we conducted comparative experiments on the same\nvalidation set for both models. Using the inverse cooking model\nas a baseline, we could ensure that our model is competitive in\npractical applications.\nDevelopment of a WeChat Miniprogram\nUsing the multilabel image classification model and ChatGPT\napplication programming interface, we developed a WeChat\nminiprogram, FoodMed Companion (FMC), for patients with\nT2DM to complement medical visits. The decision to create a\nWeChat miniprogram instead of a standalone app was because\nWeChat has over 1 billion monthly active users in China.\nAndroid and iOS users can access the WeChat miniprogram\nwithout downloading a separate app. The main functions of\nFMC are diet recording and nutrition consulting. Users enter\ntheir disease-related information and the diet their doctor\nprescribed the first time they use the program. Using the\nMultilable Image Recognition Model model, they can obtain\nquick ingredient recognition and instruction by uploading their\nmeal pictures and recording their blood sugar levels before and\nafter meals for diet tracking. The program displays recognized\ningredients in three colors, as follows: (1) green for foods\nrecommended from the selected diet for best practice, (2) yellow\nfor foods that require limited consumption under the best\npractice of the selected diet, and (3) red for foods of the selected\ndiet that are not recommended under the best practice. Patients\ncan communicate directly with the AI nutritionist or send their\nlist of ingredients to the AI nutritionist for pre- and postmeal\nconsultation, achieved by prompt engineering.\nResults\nSurvey Research\nBased on the conditions described in the Methods section, we\ncollected results from 206 patient questionnaires and 26\nendocrinology clinical doctor questionnaires. The questionnaire\nresults and option distribution are presented in Tables S1-S2\n(Multimedia Appendix 1). Figures 2 and 3 provide visualizations\nof some representative results. According to the survey results,\npatients diagnosed with prediabetes comprised the largest\nproportion, accounting for 55.34% (114/206) of the surveyed\npopulation. Most of them (161/206, 78.16%) were between 20\nand 60 years of age, mainly prediabetic, or with a disease\nduration of less than 5 years (Figure 2). Regarding lifestyle\nhabits, only 14.56% (30/206) of patients would persist in\nexercising. In terms of MNT knowledge, 85.44% (176/206) of\npatients believed that unhealthy eating habits were the leading\ncause of diabetes, and 50% (103/206) of patients believed that\ndietary management itself is the most effective measure to lower\nblood sugar (Figure 3A). However, in terms of food cognition,\nmany people believe that pork belly can raise blood sugar more\nthan carrots and yams (Figure 3B), and many still need\nknowledge of the glycemic index (Figure 3C). The results of\nthe medical quality assessment questions showed that less than\nhalf of the patients (79/206, 38.35%) felt that the doctor gave\nJ Med Internet Res 2023 | vol. 25 | e51300 | p. 4https://www.jmir.org/2023/1/e51300\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nSun et alJOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH\nXSL•FO\nRenderX\npractical and detailed dietary advice. Most patients (182/206,\n88.35%) hoped to obtain immediate and comprehensive dietitian\nservices to guide them in controlling blood sugar through an\nappropriate diet, but they wanted it to be affordable (Figure\n3D). The results of the clinical doctor survey showed that\n53.85% (14/26) of the doctors believed that dietary control was\nan effective way to control diabetes. Almost all doctors (25/26,\n96.15%) believed that unhealthy eating habits are one of the\nleading causes of diabetes. However, only 34.62% (9/26) of\nthem could comprehensively assess the patient’s condition and\ngive appropriate and detailed dietary advice.\nFigure 2.

Comparison of F1 values in the test results of 11 types of carbohydrate ingredients.\nDiscussion\nPrincipal Findings\nThis study presents the development and validation of an AI\nnutritionist program designed to address China’s growing\nepidemic of T2DM. Recognizing the limitations of traditional\npreclinical evaluation methods for AI technologies, we have\nused alternative approaches to ensure the safety and\neffectiveness of our program. Our results show strong evidence\nthat the LLM-based AI nutritionist program can perform tasks\ncomparable to a registered dietitian in both examination and\nclinical settings.\nOur study reveals a significant demand for more immediate and\ncomprehensive nutritional management and education among\npatients between 20 and 60 years of age predominantly\ndiagnosed with prediabetes or diabetes within the last 5 years.\nTime constraints prevent these patients from regular exercise,\na crucial lifestyle modification. Although exercise is more\neffective than diet control in managing diabetes, dietary control\nalone still proves highly effective [23,24]. However, nearly half\nof the patients surveyed incorrectly identified pork belly as the\nfood with the highest glycemic index among the other options,\nincluding carrot, yam, and onion. This suggests a limited\nunderstanding of nutrition. Alarmingly, 23% of endocrine\ndoctors also made the same error, casting doubt on their\nreliability as nutritional knowledge sources in China. These\nfindings highlight the urgent need for accurate nutritional\neducation and resources for both patients and medical\nprofessionals. Moreover, research from Europe has also shown\nthat the duration of patient interaction with nutritional educators\nis crucial for managing and reducing hemoglobin A1c levels\n[25]. However, the limited supply of qualified dietitians in China\nrestricts accessibility, depriving most patients of the opportunity\nfor sufficient nutritional education from a professional. To\ncompound the situation, most patients reported having only\n10-minute interactions with their doctors during each medical\nvisit [26]. Considering these findings, LLM-based software\ncould offer accessible care to Chinese patients with diabetes,\nproviding essential support for nutritional management and\neducation.\nPrevious research in medical LLMs has demonstrated that\nChatGPT excels in responding to open-ended questions, but its\nperformance tends to falter during examinations [27,28]. Our\nstudy revealed that the latest ChatGPT and GPT 4.0 models\nsuccessfully passed the Chinese Registered Dietitian\nExamination, a challenging test with an annual pass rate of only\n30%-40%. Most of the errors they made were information errors,\nwhich could be improved with more targeted training data.\nNonetheless, the examination questions do not accurately reflect\nreal-world clinical scenarios. Therefore, we evaluated\nChatGPT’s ability to answer common patient inquiries and\ncompared its food recommendations to established best\npractices. For safety considerations, we focused on the ketogenic\ndiet, a challenging yet effective treatment for diabetes, as a\nprimary example in our experiments. As anticipated, ChatGPT\nprovided reliable answers to open-ended questions about the\nketogenic diet and frequently reminded users to adhere to their\ndoctor’s advice. Among the 6 responses that received a score\nof 1 from the nutritionist judges, 3 responses (questions 10, 20,\nand 27) were found to be less informative than the expert\nresponses, 2 responses (questions 8 and 17) addressed the\nquestion from a different perspective, and 1 response (question\n12) contained inaccurate information, incorrectly suggesting\nred meat should be avoided in a ketogenic diet. After the\nevaluation, we queried question 12 from the model 10 more\ntimes, and it did not repeat the error about red meat. This result\nserves as a reminder that the LLM operates as a statistical model,\ngenerating responses from its training data in a nontransparent\nor “black box” manner. In the future, an LLM specializing in\nmedical consulting should find a balance between randomness\nand accuracy for more reliable use. We also discovered that\nChatGPT’s food recommendations generally aligned with best\npractices. However, it needed more certainty when asked about\nChinese-specific food ingredients. This issue likely arises from\na need for more training data, as we found that open-source\nrecipe data often excludes these ingredients [16].\nJ Med Internet Res 2023 | vol. 25 | e51300 | p. 10https://www.jmir.org/2023/1/e51300\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nSun et alJOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH\nXSL•FO\nRenderX\nClass imbalance happens in multilabel classification problems\nwhere the classes exist in long-tailed distribution, resulting in\nreduced recognition accuracy [29]. This issue frequently happens\nin ingredient recognition problems because a high proportion\nof food images consist of very few popular ingredients, thus\nmaking it challenging to construct an unbiased food image data\nset [30]. These problems had often impeded previous efforts in\ndeveloping an effective ingredient recognition model [22]. For\nexample, this severely affects the recognition of peanuts in the\ninverse cooking model (Figure 5). In this context, a universal\nfeature extractor, such as Dino V2, simplifies and optimizes the\ndevelopment of a robust and efficient multilabel classification\nmodel. We effectively circumvented the challenges above by\nusing single-label images to train each ingredient in its\nrecognition model separately. This approach was made possible\ndue to the capabilities of Dino V2, which can extract features\npertinent to identifying all food ingredients, reducing each\ntraining image into 1024 numbers. In our research, we\ndemonstrated that our model, based on Dino V2, significantly\nsurpassed inverse cooking, a multilabel classification model\ntrained on 1 million recipe images, which was previously\nhindered by the bottleneck mentioned earlier. Our layered model\nof 11 ingredients can identify most of the carbohydrate content\nin an image in less than 2 seconds, and the number of\nidentifiable ingredients can be scaled up without additional time\nconstraints. Furthermore, we can specifically enhance the\nrecognition of a particular ingredient by adjusting the training\ndata associated with that specific ingredient.\nThe successful management of diabetes hinges mainly on the\npatients’ adherence to the dietary recommendations provided\nby their health care provider [31]. Our innovative miniprogram,\nFMC, is designed to enhance this adherence by performing a\nseries of tasks in 2 seconds. These tasks include recognizing\nand recording dietary contents at the ingredient level from\nimages of the patient’s meals and providing immediate feedback\non the appropriateness of each recognized ingredient in the\npatient’s diet. This rapid and efficient process represents a\nsignificant improvement over traditional management\napplications that require manual input, thereby increasing the\npatient’s commitment to maintaining a consistent dietary log\nand overall diet [6,32]. Moreover, FMC has the potential to\nrevolutionize the methodology used in assessing patient\nadherence to dietary recommendations. Current research\nmethods, which predominantly rely on patient questionnaires,\noften fail to represent accurately the patient’s dietary habits.\nNew digital tools like FMC allow for more precise and rapid\npatient diet recording. Collecting these data, in turn, enables us\nto gain a more comprehensive understanding of patient\nadherence. Furthermore, it provides a more robust platform for\nstudying the impact of various diets, thereby contributing to\ndeveloping more effective dietary strategies for diabetes\nmanagement.\nLimitations\nAlthough we have shown that advanced LLM like ChatGPT\ndemonstrated promising results in the registered dietitian exam,\nresponding to frequently asked questions and providing food\nrecommendations, it is essential to note that the model was\nexposed to only some possible questions a patient might ask.\nIn addition, it can generate different answers to the same\nquestion. These limitations are inherent in any AI model training\nprocess, as predicting and including every potential query is\nimpossible. An effective strategy to mitigate the concern about\nthe LLM’s ability to respond to all possible patient questions\nat this stage could be to define a specific scope of questions that\nthe model is trained and validated to handle. By focusing on\ncommon and critical nutritional queries, we can ensure that the\nLLM provides accurate and reliable responses within this\ndefined scope. As the model continues to learn and evolve, the\nrange of questions it can handle can be gradually expanded.\nThis approach allows us to maintain control over the quality of\nthe LLM’s responses while still benefiting from its ability to\nprocess and analyze language at scale.\nConclusions\nOur positive results advocate for a clinical pilot study to advance\nour AI nutritionist program. This study should evaluate its\neffectiveness in a real-world clinical setting, focusing on patient\nadherence to dietary recommendations and the subsequent\nimpact on their health outcomes. Furthermore, the pilot study\nshould explore the potential of our AI nutritionist program to\nserve as a tool for continuous patient education, providing\npatients with timely and accurate nutritional information to help\nthem make informed dietary decisions. Regarding safety\nmeasures, the AI nutritionist program must be limited to\nproviding nutritional information and dietary recommendations.\nAdditionally, all generated responses should be subject to human\nexpert review within 48 hours. Upon discovery, the patient\nshould receive immediate notification if an incorrect response\nis generated. This approach ensures the safety and accuracy of\nthe information provided while maximizing the potential benefits\nof the AI nutritionist program.\nAcknowledgments\nThis research received no specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\nThe authors used GPT 4.0 to polish the language in this paper.
