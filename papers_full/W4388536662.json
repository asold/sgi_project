The results of this quantitative analysis\nmake it clear that almost two-thirds of the students surveyed use or have used AI-based tools\nas part of their studies. In this context, almost half of the students explicitly mention ChatGPT\nor GPT-4 as a tool they use. Students of engineering sciences, mathematics and natural\nsciences use AI-based tools most frequently. A differentiated examination of the usage\nbehaviour makes it clear that students use AI-based tools in a variety of ways. Clarifying\nquestions of understanding and explaining subject-speciﬁc concepts are the most relevant\nreasons for use in this context.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02304-7 OPEN\n1 Darmstadt University of Applied Sciences (Hochschule Darmstadt, h_da), Schöfferstrasse 3, 64295 Darmstadt, Germany.✉email: joerg.vongarrel@h-da.de\nHUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS|          (2023) 10:799 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02304-7 1\n1234567890():,;\nIntroduction\nA\nrtiﬁcial intelligence (AI) is a key technology with the\npotential to fundamentally change entire markets,\nindustries, business activities and business models (von\nGarrel et al.,2022). Since November 2022, the topic has reached a\nnew level of attention when the US company Open AI published\nChatGPT, an AI-supported computer model for language pro-\ncessing, which reached millions of users worldwide after only a\nfew days (Janson,2023). This was followed on 14 May 2023 by\nthe launch of ChatGPT-4, which can process both text and image\ninput, including text documents, photos, diagrams, or screen-\nshots, and which, according to the manufacturer, performs on a\nhuman level in various professional and academic benchmarks\n(OpenAI, 2023a).\nThe possibilities for the use of such AI tools are manifold. In\nthe business context, such AI tools could be used, for example, in\ninteractions with customers, internal service organisation or in\nthe recruitment of new employees (Kohne et al.,2020). In the\nscientiﬁc context, such tools can support text analysis, translate\ntexts, or even write abstracts for research papers (Berdejo-Espi-\nnola and Amano,2023). In addition, theﬁrst publications already\nexist in which such tools are listed as co-authors (Stokel-Walker,\n2023). In theﬁeld of education, these tools could support pupils\nand students to reﬂect on scientiﬁc practices, to optimise their\ntexting, to have texts proofread or even to act as tutors for exam\npreparation (Marx, 2023). However, these opportunities are also\ncountered by risks— from security concerns to misinformation to\na lack of scientiﬁc rigour (Albrecht,2023). Open AI, for example,\nadmits that ChatGPT can sometimes generate plausible-sound-\ning, but erroneous and incorrect answers (OpenAI,2022). Fur-\nthermore, with regard to use, there are risks in the collection of\nusage data, the more dif ﬁcult assessment of the results, the\nunclear authorship, as well as the unreﬂective and abusive use of\nchatbots (Mohr et al., 2023). As a consequence, individual\ncountries have temporarily banned the use of the tool (e.g. Italy);\norganisations (including Samsung, JPMorgan) or schools and\neducational institutions have also restricted and continue to\nrestrict the use of AI-based tools by their employees or pupils or\nstudents (Hughes, 2023; Lukpat, 2023).\nEspecially against this background, initial empirical studies\nalready exist that analyse the use of AI-based tools in various\ncontexts, but there is no Germany-wide study of the use of such\nAI systems by students in the context of studying and teaching.\nThe aim of this report is therefore to analyse the use of AI-based\nsystems in studies. To this end, a survey of students enroled at a\nGerman university at that time was conducted between 15 May\n2023 and 5 June 2023.\nIn order to meet this objective, this report is divided intoﬁve\nsections. After the ﬁrst introductory section, the next section\nbrieﬂy presents the basic theoretical as well as empirical state-of-\nthe-art. The next section then presents the methodological\napproach and a brief overview of the limitations of this study. The\nnext section presents the descriptive results of the study. The\npenultimate section re\nﬂects on the entire procedure with regard\nto the quality criteria of objectivity, reliability and validity. The\nlast section concludes the documentation with a conclusion and\noutlook.\nState of the art\nThe term artiﬁcial intelligence is not universally deﬁned, not least\nbecause the understanding of AI evolves with technological\nprogress and the concept of intelligence itself is very complex and\ntherefore cannot be clearly delineated (e.g. Federal Government\nof the Federal Republic of Germany,2018). In addition, AI is a\nmulti- and interdisciplinary subject area and can therefore be\nstudied from different perspectives (Lu,2019). Although the term\nAI has its origins as early as the 1950s, the eminent advances in\nthe performance of computer systems, the quality of algorithms\nand the availability and storage of data in recent years have sig-\nniﬁcantly accelerated the further development and possible\napplications of AI in many areas. Artiﬁcial intelligence refers to\nmethods, processes and technologies that enable IT systems, such\nas machines, robots or software systems, to interpret large\namounts of data and to learn from this data in order to emulate\nor imitate certain human cognitive abilities (e.g. Di Vaio et al.,\n2020). In this way, tasks that require visual perception, language\nor strategic thinking and planning, for example, can be carried\nout independently and efﬁciently by IT systems.\nOverall, this makes it clear that the diversity of possible AI\nsystems is great. In order to do justice to this diversity of possible\nareas of application,ﬁelds of use and designs of AI-based tools,\nvarious approaches exist for reducing complexity and structuring.\nIn this report, the structuring of artiﬁcial intelligence according to\nvon Garrel et al. (2022) is followed and the following morpho-\nlogical box can therefore be used to approach the concept of AI-\nbased tools for teaching and learning (Table1).\nIn the context of studying and teaching, cognitive systems in\nparticular, which focus on informational work and thus also\ninformation as an object, seem to be highly suitable. Such AI-\nsupported computer models for language processing are often\nbased on artiﬁcial neural networks, which enable an efﬁcient\nconversion of language into mathematical parameters and thus\nallow a high level of complexity and large amounts of data to be\nprocessed (Albrecht, 2023). In the ﬁrst step, the system inde-\npendently processes large quantities of texts and forms para-\nmeters from them— the ChatGPT model, for example, comprises\n175 billion parameters (Albrecht,2023). The system can then use\nhuman feedback to ﬁne-tune a speciﬁc task and convincingly\nimitate a wide variety of text types at high speed (Albrecht,2023).\nThe impact of such AI-based tools in society, business and\nscience can be signiﬁcant. A recent study by OpenAI concludes\nthat for about 80% of the US workforce, at least 10% of their work\ntasks could be affected by the introduction of their AI-based tools.\nFor nearly one-ﬁfth of workers, at least 50% of tasks could be\nimpacted (Eloundou et al.,2023).\nEven though the above morphology clearly depicts possible\nfunctions of AI-based tools, a concrete list of possible uses of AI-\nbased tools in studies across disciplines and as complete as pos-\nsible cannot be found. An analysis reveals the following possible\nuses for students:\n\"Research and literature study\".\n\"Text analysis, text processing and/or text creation\".\n\"Programming and simulations\".\n\"Exam Preparation\".\n\"Language processing\".\n\"Clariﬁcation of comprehension questions and explanation of\nsubject-speciﬁc concepts\".\n\"Translations\".\n\"Research and literature study\".\n\"Concept development (including project designs) and/or\ndesign\".\n\"Problem solving and decision making\".\n\"Data analysis, visualisation and modelling\".\n\"Teacher training\".\nAs described, however, these tools have characteristics\n(including the generation of misinformation) that cast doubt on\ntheir uncritical use in the ﬁeld of teaching and learning. For\nexample, Open AI admitted at the initial launch of ChatGPT that\nthe chatbot sometimes generated plausible sounding but incorrect\nARTICLE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02304-7\n2 HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS|          (2023) 10:799 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02304-7\nand faulty answers (OpenAI,2022). The latest version, GPT-4, is\nsaid to be more reliable, more creative, and also able to process\nmore sophisticated instructions than the previous version\n(OpenAI, 2023b). Nevertheless, the new version has similar\nlimitations to previous models and is not yet completely reliable,\nas facts are“hallucinated” and errors in thinking are made (ibid.).\nOpen AI advises exercising great care when using the chatbot in\ncontexts where demands are high or the stakes are high, or to\nrefrain from using it altogether (OpenAI,2023a).\nSince such AI tools can thus produce false, misleading, une-\nthical, discriminatory, or socially unacceptable results, which can\nresult from existing prejudices during technical development,\npoor data quality or inadequate modelling, among other things\n(Strauß, 2021), an uncritical and unreﬂective use of AI tools in\nthe ﬁeld of study & teaching is risky. In this context, the following\ntable provides an overview of relevant properties of AI-based\ntools for use in teaching and learning from the perspective of\ncurrent publications from theory and practice (including Berger\nand von Garrel,2022; OpenAI,2023a; Kohne et al.,2020; Krüger,\n2021; Jahn, 2023; Neu et al.,2022) (Table 2).\nIn addition to this theoretical-conceptual approach to the topic,\nempirical studies have been conducted on the use of AI-based\ntools in general and ChatGPT and GPT-4 in particular. An\nanalysis that has been carried out since the launch of ChatGPT\nshows, among other things, the following empirical studies in an\ninternational context:\n● Ali et al. (2023)\n● Choudhury and Shamszare (2023)\n● Firaina and Sulisworo (2023)\n● Forman et al. (2023)\n● Hosseini et al. (2023)\n● Sakirin and Said (2023)\n● Skjuve et al. (2023)\n● Strzelecki (2023)\n● Zhang et al. (2023)\nAs a brief conclusion, it can be said that both in the theoretical\nand empirical context, usage behaviour with regard to AI-based\ntools (and ChatGPT in particular) is highly relevant as an object\nof observation. However, there is no national study on the\nTable 1 Morphology of AI-based systems (based on von Garrel et al.,2022).\nKey features Characteristics\nFunction Data aggregation &\nﬁltering\nOptimisation Planning Information enrichment\nand processing\nCommunicating\nForecast Argumentation/Conclusion/\nJustiﬁcation\nSearch Learning Awareness/Recognition\nData perception Audio Video Digital Smell IoT (sensory data) Statistical data, sample\nSubject Materials Goods Information Data carrier Other objects\nActivity type Energetic work informational work\nType of work Mechanically Motor Reactively Combinatory Creatively\nAutonomy level No support/human\ndecides\nAction support/assisted\ndecision-making\nDecision support/partial\ndecision-making\nMixed/reviewed decision Automated/delegated\ndecision making\nComplete automation/autonomous\ndecision-making\nForm of presentation and\ninteraction\nPhysical system available (hardware) (Pure) Cognitive System (software)\nClassical Collaborative Machine Conventional application Immersive application (MR, AR, VR)\nMobile Stationary\nSocial preference Computer-mediated communication Man –machine interaction\nExplainability/\ntransparency\nNone (decision of the algorithm is presented\nwithout explanation)\nLow (user receives data as a basis for decision-making) High (user receives an explanatory/(visual) conclusion of the\nalgorithm based on the underlying data)\nInteractivity Static, no adjustment of interaction AI can adapt to humans through interaction with the\nemployee\nCan autonomously adapt to individual users in a personalised way\nthrough interaction with humans\nTable 2 Relevant properties of AI-based tools for use in\nteaching and learning.\nCategory Characteristics\nInteraction Adaptation of the interaction to the user (e.g. personalised\nadaptation to previous chat history)\nError detection/correction during input (e.g. grammar)\nError prevention during output (e.g. misinformation)\nReasoning Degree of scienti ﬁcity (e.g. citation/source citation)\nExplainability of the decision (e.g. comprehensibility of the\nresults)\nLogical reasoning\nUsability Learning ability (e.g. AI learns from chat histories)\nCommunication with the system (e.g. colloquial vs.\ntechnical language)\nUser interface (e.g. clarity)\nPossibilities of interactive input (e.g. input in text, language,\nimage)\nPossibilities of interactive output (e.g. output in text,\nlanguage, image)\nSize of the output (e.g. 10, 20, 50, 80 pages output)\nExtent of input (e.g. 1, 2, 5, 10 pages of input)\nSafety Consideration of safety protocols (e.g. age restrictions)\nConsideration of ethical standards (e.g. no discrimination)\nDegree of data protection (e.g. handling of personal data)\nHUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02304-7 ARTICLE\nHUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS|          (2023) 10:799 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02304-7 3\nconcrete usage behaviour and relevant characteristics of the use of\nthese tools among students, as intended in this report.\nMethodical approach\nIn order to meet the objective of the study, a quantitative survey is\nconducted by means of an online questionnaire. The survey\nincludes a questionnaire on the general topic of the use and\nintensity of use of AI-based tools for studying, as well as a choice-\nbased conjoint experiment (CBC) (see Appendix). In the CBC,\nthe participants have to make 8ﬁctitious purchase decisions, each\nchoosing from two offers. A question is then asked explicitly\nabout the characteristic(s) that are most important to the students\nin their evaluation. For this purpose, the 15 characteristics pre-\nsented in the section“State of the art” were evaluated in terms of\nrelevance within the framework of a preliminary study with\n36 students from various disciplines. The self-explicated method\nwas used to identify theﬁve most relevant characteristics from the\nstudents’point of view. The results show that the most relevant\nfeatures for the use of AI-based language tools are error avoidance\nduring output (M = 85.86, SD= 19.10), the degree of scientiﬁcity\n(M = 85.11, SD = 22.31), logical reasoning ( M = 83.58,\nSD = 17.25), explainability of the decision ( M = 81.69,\nSD = 20.39) and error detection/correction during input\n(M = 71.00, SD= 32.69). The characteristic expressions that were\nidentiﬁed in the context of the self-explicated method have been\nrevised again to ensure the comprehensibility of the designations.\nA questionnaire on the general topic of the use of AI-based tools\nfor studying forms the second section. Before the survey was sent\nout, a pre-test was carried out. This survey is a self-selection sample\n(Döring and Bortz,2016,p .3 0 6 ) ,w h i c hi sa d d r e s s e di n d i r e c t l yt o\nstudents from different German universities. The general call for\nparticipation was sent to contact persons at the respective uni-\nversities, with the request that they forward it to the students.\nThere are currently a total of 423 universities in Germany\n(DESTATIS, 2023a; Hochschulkompass, n.d.), of which 395, or\n93%, could be contacted. For those universities that could not be\ncontacted, no contact address could be identiﬁed. Private higher\neducation institutions were primarily affected by this.\nThe contact persons were selected deliberately and system-\natically via the websites of the respective universities with the aim\nof identifying study programme coordinators for each study\nprogramme. In this way, a total of 3,849 programme coordinators\nfrom 395 different higher education institutions and universities\ncould be contacted. Among the persons contacted are 2739\nprofessors and 1110 other persons with an administrative func-\ntion (Table 3).\nOverall, the study has some limitations, which will be brieﬂy\ndiscussed:\n● Methodological procedure : Due to the methodological\nprocedure, this is a non-probabilistic sample, as the\nselection of the survey elements is not randomised. This\nis associated with limited representativeness compared to\nprobabilistic samples, but it is still possible to work with\nnon-probabilistic samples in the context of exploratory\nstudies, as the focus here is not on the precise estimation of\npopulation parameters. Rather, exploratory studies are\nconcerned with the formation of theories about cause-effect\nrelationships and their testing with regard to their degree of\nvalidity (Döring and Bortz,2016, p. 301ff.).\n● Titling of the study : The emails are sent with the title\n“ChatGPT use in studies: invitation to a short scientiﬁc\nstudy”. In this context, the“hype” around ChatGPT is thus\nalso deliberately included. Due to the double selection step\nin accessing the sample, bias may occur here, as this title\nmay particularly address colleagues at universities as well as\nstudents who have an afﬁnity with the topic.\n● Language of the questionnaire: The questionnaire is only\navailable in German, as it focuses on the target group of\nstudents who are enroled in Germany. Students (and\npossibly colleagues) who are not ﬂuent in German may\ntherefore be limited in their ability to participate in the\nsurvey.\n● Understanding of AI: The study focuses on an analysis of\nthe use of AI-based tools. ChatGPT” is mentioned in the\ntitle. The greeting also refers to “AI-based tools (e.g.\nChatGPT, DeepL, DALL-E)” and “AI-based language tools,\nsuch as ChatGPT”. Here, too, a bias may result from a\npossible dominance in favour of a high degree of use of the\ntool “ChatGPT/GPT-4”.\n● Self-assignment to a ﬁeld of study: The study deliberately\naims at the use of AI-based software among students who\nare enroled in Germany and claims to consider allﬁelds of\nstudy. The classiﬁcation of study areas according to the\nFederal Statistical Ofﬁce is followed (DESTATIS, 2023c).\nThe allocation in these statistics follows the information\nprovided by the higher education institutions. Within the\nscope of the study, an allocation of the degree programme\nis made by the students themselves. Here, too, a bias can\nresult such that certainﬁelds of study (e.g. humanities) are\nmisinterpreted or the allocation of certain study pro-\ngrammes (e.g. computer science to theﬁeld of engineering)\nis not clear to the students. In addition, interdisciplinary\ndegree programmes are becoming increasingly important,\nso that their allocation to aﬁeld of study (e.g. industrial\nengineering to the ﬁeld of study “engineering” or “law,\neconomics and social sciences”) is also uncertain.\n● Social desirability: Even if anonymity is guaranteed in the\nsurvey and this is also explicitly stated several times, social\ndesirability— i.e. the conscious or unconscious falsiﬁcation\nof answers in order to avoid rejection, criticism or social\nsanctions— can also lead to a distortion of the results.\n● Background of use: Since, as described, the topic has a high\npublic relevance and the use is discussed in particular in the\ncontext of studying and teaching from the perspective of\nboth students and teachers, the use of AI-based software\ncan also result from induction by the university itself and\nthus the use of AI-based software can be regarded as a\nmethodological-didactic instrument induced by the\nteachers.\nResults\nPopulation and Sample. The population of the survey includes\nall persons enroled at a German higher education institution or\nuniversity at the time of the survey.\nTable 3 Universities and persons addressed.\nAddressed Total Professorial Administrative\nUniversities addressed 395\nPersons addressed 3849 2739 1110\nDeans 546 425 121\nAssociate Deans 371 351 20\nDeans of Studies 764 706 58\nStudy programme directors 576 521 55\nCoordinators 233 66 167\nOther directors 365 223 142\nSecretariats 45 0 45\nOthers 949 447 502\nARTICLE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02304-7\n4 HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS|          (2023) 10:799 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02304-7\nAccording to preliminaryﬁgures, a total of 2,924,276 students\nwere enroled at German higher education institutions in the\nwinter semester 2022/2023 (DESTATIS,2023b). The number of\nstudents in Germany is thus currently around 2.9 million. Of\nthese, 12% study in Baden-Württemberg, 14% in Bavaria, seven\npercent in Berlin, 2% in Brandenburg, 1% in Bremen, 4% in\nHamburg, 9% in Hesse, 1% in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania,\n7% in Lower Saxony, 26% in North Rhine-Westphalia, 4% in\nRhineland-Palatinate, 1% in Saarland, 4% in Saxony, 2% in\nSaxony-Anhalt, 2% in Schleswig-Holstein and 5% in Thuringia\n(DESTATIS, 2023b). Eleven percent of students in Germany\nstudy humanities, 1% study sports, 39% study law, economics,\nand social sciences, 11% study mathematics and natural sciences,\n7% study human medicine and health sciences, 2% study\nagriculture, forestry and nutrition, 26% study engineering and\n3% study arts and art sciences (DESTATIS,2023c).\nThe characteristics of the federal state and subject group are\ncollected as part of the survey in order to be able to make\nstatements about the characteristic-speci ﬁc representativeness\n(Döring and Bortz,2016, p. 298) of the sample.\nA total of 8802 responses were recorded in the survey. 363\npersons did not consent to data protection, 115 persons stated\nthat they were not enroled at a German university and 1973\npersons did not complete the survey. Those cases areﬁltered out,\nleaving a sample size of 6311 cases.\nThere were 3807 females, 2132 males, and 82 miscellaneous\npersons who participated in the survey. 138 persons did not\nindicate their gender. The proportion of female persons (60.3%)\nthus deviates from the basic population. According to provisional\nﬁgures, 50.6% of students were female in the winter semester\n2022/2023 (DESTATIS,2022). The average age of the students in\nthe sample (M = 24.21, SD= 5.07) is slightly above the average\nage of the population. Thus, students in Germany were on\naverage 23.5 years old in the winter semester of 2021/2022\n(DESTATIS, 2023b) (Table 4).\nOf the respondents, 36% are studying subjects in theﬁelds of law,\neconomics, and social sciences. 20% of the respondents study\nhumanities, 17% engineering, 9% mathematics and natural sciences,\n8% human medicine or health sciences, 5% arts and art sciences, 1%\nagricultural, forestry and nutrition sciences or veterinary medicine\nand 1% sports. 4% of the respondents studied other subjects or\ncould not be clearly assigned to any of theﬁelds (Table5).\nThe majority of respondents study in Bavaria (17%), North\nRhine-Westphalia (17%), Hesse (15%), Bremen (13%) and\nBaden-Württemberg (12%). Another 7% study in Rhineland-\nPalatinate, 5% in Thuringia, 5% in Hamburg, 2% in\nMecklenburg-Western Pomerania, 2% in Saarland, 2% in\nSaxony-Anhalt, and 1% each in Schleswig-Holstein, Berlin,\nBrandenburg, Saxony and Lower Saxony (Table6).\nUse of AI-based tools as part of the study programme. The\ncentral issue of the study focuses on the use of AI-based tools by\nstudents. Overall, almost two-thirds (63.4%) of the students\nsurveyed state that they have used AI-based tools for their studies.\nA detailed analysis of the degree of use shows that every fourth\nstudent (25.2%) uses AI-based tools (very) frequently, while\nalmost half of the students (47.8%) use AI-based tools (very)\nrarely or occasionally. Slightly more than a third of the students\n(36.6%) do not use AI-based tools at all. With a mean value of\n2.93 (SD= 1.961), the overall picture of use is diffuse (Table7).\nIf we now look at the intensity of use subdivided according to\nthe ﬁelds of study, differences become clear. The highest usage\nvalues are found in the engineering sciences as well as in\nmathematics and the natural sciences. More than three-quarters\n(75.3%) in engineering, almost three-quarters in arts and\nhumanities (73.4%) and over 70% (71.9%) in mathematics and\nnatural sciences of the students surveyed use these tools. More\nthan half of the students also use AI-based tools for studies in the\nhumanities (61.0%), law, economics, and social sciences (58.4%)\nin human medicine and health sciences (52.7%).

With a response rate of n = 28,\nhowever, the question of the validity of this value should be noted\nhere. In the otherﬁelds of study, slightly more than half (56.8%)\nof the students use AI-based tools (Table8).\nAn analysis of usage behaviour according to the degree pursued\nmakes it clear that the proportion of students who use AI-based\ntools as part of their studies is higher in the Master’s programme\n(M = 3.30, SD = 1.972) than in the Bachelor ’s programme\n(M = 2.99, SD = 1.965) or as part of a doctoral programme\n(M = 2.65, SD= 1.990).

Female and diverse students show\npercentages of around 60% (59.6% for female respondents and\n62.2% for diverse students) (Table9).\nConcrete use of AI-based tools. The explicit (and open) query\nabout concrete tools results in the following order (top 5 AI tools\nin studies):\n1. ChatGPT\n2. DeepL\n3. DALL-E\n4. Midjourney\n5.

Almost a third\n(30.2%) of students in theﬁeld of art and art sciences\nalso use\nthese tools for concept development and design.\nPreferred characteristics of AI-based tools. In order to identify\nthe most important characteristics of an AI-based tool from the\nstudents’point of view, in addition to the degree of use and the\ncentral areas of use, the students surveyed were givenﬁve possible\ncharacteristics. The percentage agreement values result in the\nfollowing order of relevance: 1. degree of scientiﬁcity (e.g. cita-\ntion). 2. avoidance of errors in output (e.g. hallucination) 3.\nlogical argumentation (e.g. answers are comprehensible) 4. price\n5. explainability of the decision (e.g. white-box vs. black-box) 6.\nerror detection and correction during input (e.g. grammar)\n(Table 12).\nA dedicated evaluation according to the study areas conﬁrms in\nall study areas the relevance and order of scientiﬁcity as the most\nimportant criterion, error avoidance during output as well as\nlogical argumentation as criteria directly following in relevance.\nCritical reﬂection\nIn addition to the limitations of the methodology already men-\ntioned in the section“Methodological approach”, the procedure\ncan be further critically reﬂected based on the quality criteria of\nquantitative research, objectivity, reliability, and validity.\nObjectivity is assumed for the results. This is supported by the\nfact that the conduct of the survey is independent of the\nauthorship due to the online survey and that the questionnaire is\nstandardised.\nIt can be assumed that the results can be reproduced in a new\nsurvey with the same measurement instrument and an\nunchanged measurement object. This is supported by the fact\nthat students from all subject groups were surveyed throughout\nGermany. For this reason, it is assumed that the results are\nreliable. However, it should be mentioned here that the dis-\ntribution of students in the sample does not correspond exactly\nto the distribution in the population. A chi-square goodness-of-\nﬁt test shows that the observed frequencies in the distribution\nof ﬁelds of study deviate signiﬁcantly from the expected fre-\nquencies based on the distribution in the population ( χ2 (8,\nn = 6306) = 2940.258, p < 0.001).

There is also a signi ﬁcant difference between the\nobserved and expected frequencies (χ2 (1, n = 5939) = 461.755,\np < 0.001). No information can be given here on the number of\ndiverse students, as no ofﬁcial statistics are available on this.\nThe average age in the sample differs signi ﬁcantly from the\naverage age of students in Germany, T (5479) = 10.390,\np <0 . 0 0 1 ,d = 0.140. According to Cohen, this is a weak effect.\nThe content validity of the survey was ensured by oper-\nationalising as completely as possible the abilities of language-\nbased AI tools in the context of studies, using ChatGPT/GPT-4 as\nan example. Since there have been no comprehensive surveys to\ndate that take into account all areas of study and the relevant\napplication possibilities, it was decided to ask ChatGPT itself\nabout its possible uses. From the responses of the AIs, an over-\nview of the different possible uses emerged, divided into the\nvarious use categories. These were collected in the questionnaire\nin the context of the areas of use (ChatGPT, personal commu-\nnication, 03. & 04.05.2023, see appendix).\nSince no studies on concrete usage behaviour and relevant trait\ncharacteristics in the use of AI-based tools could be found on a\nnational level so far, construct validity cannot be conclusively\ncertiﬁed.\nIn summary, it can be said that although it is not completely\npossible to comply with the quality criteria in their entirety, this is\ndue to the subject of the study. Since AI-based tools such as\nChatGPT are a new development that has only become increas-\ningly popular in recent months, there have only been limited\nstudies on this subject of investigation so far. For this reason, the\nprocedure for the present study was very explorative.\nConclusion and prospects\nThe study makes it clear that AI-based tools have found their way\namong students in allﬁelds of study in Germany and are being used.\nAlmost two-thirds of the respondents have used or are using such\ntools. In this context, theﬁelds of engineering and mathematics and\nnatural sciences show the highest intensity. In addition to the already\ndescribed circumstance that the use of such tools could be actively\ndemanded in the study programmes of these areas, further reasons\nfor this high use could lie in a possible afﬁnity for technology on the\npart of the students in these areas and/or— considering that the\ndegrees of use show gender-speciﬁcd i f f e r e n c e s— also in a possible\nhigher proportion of male students in these study areas. If one\nconsiders the higher usageﬁgures of such AI-based tools in the\ncontext of private use in this context, a possible, higher use of AI-\nbased tools in the area of study & teaching can also be assumed here.\nIn this context, almost half of all students surveyed explicitly\nmention ChatGPT or GPT-4 as a tool they use. The diffusion of\nthis tool among students is well-advanced. A differentiated\nexamination of the usage behaviour according to the ﬁelds of\nstudy makes it clear that the students use AI-based tools in a\nvariety of ways. In addition, the results show that the relevant\ncharacteristics that AI-based systems should ideally possess from\nthe students’point of view are also of a different nature.\nWhat needs to be further investigated in this context is the\noccurrence of the gap between the importance of scientiﬁcity on\nthe one hand, which is named as the most relevant criterion by\nalmost three-quarters of the students, and the importance of\nlogical reasoning (e.g. answers are comprehensible) (~50%) and\nexplainability of the decision (e.g. white box vs. black box)\n(~35%) on the other hand. The fact that error avoidance in the\noutput (e.g. hallucination) is regarded as very relevant or not by\nabout half of the students will also have to be investigated further.\nThis documentation is a purely descriptive presentation of the\nresults. Therefore, future inferential statistical evaluations will\nfollow in order to obtain further analyses and thus also more\ndetailed insights into the use of AI-based tools in studying and\nteaching.\nData availability\nThe datasets generated during and/or analysed during the current\nstudy are available in the tudatalib-repository,https://doi.org/10.\n48328/tudatalib-1219.\nReceived: 2 August 2023; Accepted: 23 October 2023;\nReferences\nAlbrecht S (2023) ChatGPT und andere Computermodelle zur Sprachverarbeitung\n— Grundlagen, Anwendungspotenziale und mögliche Auswirkungen.

Since the authors’university does not have its own ethics committee, the\nguideline for the ethics vote of the German Research Foundation (DFG— Deutsche\nForschungsgemeinschaft) was followed. This guideline states that an ethics application\nmust be submitted if at least one of the following points applies: (1) The study involves\npersons who require special protection (“vulnerable groups”), such as persons with\nlimited capacity to consent. (2) The investigation and the material used in it are likely to\ntrigger strong emotions, strong psychological stress or traumatic experiences in the\nparticipants (interviewees, informants, project staff, researchers and research subjects)\nthat go beyond everyday experiences. (3) The research implies physical risks to parti-\ncipants or results in physical pain. (4) Potential participants should not be informed\nabout the investigation. (5) Potential participants should not be informed about the\npotential risks of participation and measures to prevent harm. (6) Participation in the\ninvestigation implies deception (e.g., in laboratory experiments). (7) The study exposes\nparticipants (interviewees, informants, project collaborators, researchers, and research\nsubjects) to special risks (such as social risks, risks of criminal or civil liability,ﬁnancial\nlosses, professional disadvantages or damage to reputation; risk due to the difﬁcult\nsecurity situation in the investigation area). Since none of these points apply, an ethics\napplication is not necessary in this case.\nInformed consent\nInformed consent was obtained from all participants and/or their legal guardians.\nAdditional information\nSupplementary information The online version contains supplementary material\navailable at https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02304-7.\nCorrespondence and requests for materials should be addressed to Jörg von Garrel.\nReprints and permission informationis available athttp://www.nature.com/reprints\nPublisher’s noteSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in\npublished maps and institutional afﬁliations.\nOpen Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons\nAttribution 4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing,\nadaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give\nappropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative\nCommons license, and indicate if changes were made.
