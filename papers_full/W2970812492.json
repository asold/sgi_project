  "abstract": "In this paper, the concept of active cell-balancing technique, by using a multiple-outputs double-forward converter for lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries, is investigated. It controls two times more cells than secondaries, and it equalizes eight cells in a series. In this method, four secondaries can reasonably be wound with the same back electromotive force (EMF). This means a low pin count on the transformer and a low bill of materials (BOM). The bridge uses four N-channel MOSFETs as switches, which means two times fewer transistors than cells, resulting in fewer switching losses. This scheme is applied for controlling the minimum voltage among the cells of the lithium-ion battery. It uses a multi-winding transformer based on a forward double converter structure. Conventional schemes using a multi-winding transformer for electric vehicles (EVs) require an equal number of secondaries per cell. This scheme requires one secondary for two adjacent cells, thus the number of secondaries is reduced by a factor of two. Also, the redistribution of charge from a high cell to a low cell does not require many switching components and little intelligence to determine low cell voltage detection. The basic principle of this method is to use the overall battery pack voltage as a reference to supply individual cells, using a forward converter containing a transformer with a well-chosen winding ratio. The experimental and simulation results are performed to verify the feasibility of the proposed system.",
