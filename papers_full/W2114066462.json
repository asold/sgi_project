Introduction\nSMS (Short Message Service) has achieved huge \nsuccess in the wireless world. It is a technology that \nenables  the  sending  and  receiving  of  messages \nbetween  mobile  phones.  As  suggested  by the  name \n\"Short Message Service\", the data that can be held by \nan SMS message is very limited. One SMS message \ncan contain at most 140 bytes (1,120 bits) of data, so \none SMS message can contain up to:\n- 160 characters if 7-bit character encoding is used. \n(7-bit  character  encoding  is  suitable  for  encoding \nLatin characters like English alphabets.)\n- 70 characters if 16-bit Unicode UCS2 character \nencoding is used. (SMS text messages containing non-\nLatin characters such as Chinese characters should use \n16-bit character encoding.)\nPerson-to-person  text  messaging  is  the  most \ncommonly used SMS application and it is what the \nSMS technology was originally designed for. In these \nkind  of text  messaging  applications,  a  mobile  user \ntypes an SMS text message using the keypad of his/her \nmobile phone,  then  he/she  enters the mobile phone \nnumber  of the  recipient  and  finally sends  the  text \nmessage out.\nHowever, the small phone keypad and the limited \nmessage lengths caused a number  of adaptations of \nspelling,  as  in  the  phrase  \"txt  msg\",  or  use  of \nCamelCase, such as in \"ThisIsVeryCool\". Users aim to \nuse the least  number of characters needed to transmit \na  comprehensible  message.  Hence,  punctuation  and \ngrammar are largely ignored [5].\nTo circumvent the bottleneck of the keyboard entry, \ntwo quite different strategies are encountered: one is to \nassist  the  user  with  optimized  predictive  text  entry \nsolutions ([1],  [2]), which consists in some form of \ndisambiguation to determine which letter, among the \nthree  or  four  letters  shared  by  the  same  key,  is \nintended  by  the  writer  (see  [1]  for  complete \nreferences).  Another  is  to  replace  the  keyboard  by \nhandwriting input, using either a stylus and a screen, \nor a digital pen and paper solution connected to the \nGSM phones. Our goal here is to improve recognition \nof handwritten message to allow them to be sent like \nnormal text SMS.\nIt has been proved that language models allow to \nincrease  significantly  the  recognition  rate  of \nhandwriting systems [3]. They allow minimizing the \nerror  recognition  rate  by  taking  into  account  the \ncontext in order to disambiguate poorly written texts. \nTwo approaches are likely to be implemented. One is \nbased  on  structural  models  specifically designed  by \nlinguistic experts, while the other approach relies on \nsome statistics computed on large written text corpora. \nOne example of the latter  being the well-known n-\ngram models, which work either at the character or at \nthe word levels.\nIn  this  paper,  we have  identified  three  different \nphenomena that alter SMS texts, and we propose for \neach of them a specific adaptation of the handwriting \nrecognition engine.\n2. SMS language\nFor both technical reasons   ̶̶ limited length of the \ntext  and  multiple  taps  of the  key,  and  sociological \nreasons   ̶̶  short  messages  are  particularly  popular \namongst teens, several phenomena affect SMS texts \nwhen compared to standard written productions. A few \nare listed below.\n2.1. Rebus style\nRebus  style  writing  is  characterized  by using  a \nsingle  letter  or digit  to replace a  whole syllable or \nword.  Examples are:\n−be → b ; you  → u ; are  →  r (single letter replace \nwhole word) ;\n−ate → 8 ; for → 4 ; to, too → 2 (single digit replace \na whole word) ;\n−skate → sk8 ; later → l8er ; before → b4 (letter or \ndigit replace a whole syllable within word) ;\nUsing only rebus style, one can easily construct a \nwhole phrase, for example “c u l8er!” (see you later!).\n2.2. Consonant Skeleton style\nConsonant  Skeleton  style is characterized by the \nwithdrawal of most of the vowels of a word, leaving \nonly the “consonant skeleton” of the word. Obvious \nexamples  are  “text  →  txt”,  “people  →  ppl”.  This \ntransformation can  keep some vowels and should not \nnecessarily  keep  all  consonants  (nasal  consonants, \nwhen combined to nasal vowels are removed most of \nthe time).\n2.3. Phonetic style\nThis phenomenon follows few morphological rules, \nexcept that transformed text, when read, should keep \nroughly the same pronunciation than the genuine one, \nfor  example:  “giv  me  som  luv”  (“give  me  some \nlove”).\nAlthough this phenomena is pretty rare in English, \nit is very common in French, since French word often \ncontains  mute  letters  that can  be  removed  without \nmodifying the pronunciation of the word.\n2.4. Mixed styles\nCombinations of the above can shorten a single or \nmultiple words. In addition, punctuation marks could \nbe removed ; only period and exclamation marks are \ngenerally used. The space and capital letter are often \nomitted after a period. Whole words may be omitted, \nespecially articles.\nOther transcriptions of slang or dialect terms can \nbe used if shorter than the original words, as in “cos” \n(standing for “because”).\nCombining  the  above  “techniques”  can  shorten \nwhole sentences. A few more examples are:\n−Are you going to the pub tonight?\n−ru goin pub 2nyt \n−Hi mate. Are you okay? I am sorry that I forgot to \ncall you last night. Why don't we go and see a film \ntomorrow? (120 characters)\n−hi m8 u k?-sry i 4gt 2 cal u lst nyt-y dnt we go c  \nfilm 2moz (60 characters) \nSimilar examples can be found in the SMS corpora \nprovided by [1]. Note that the transformation leads to \nnew  way  of  writing  known  words,  such  word  is \nsubsequently called a “neography”.\nThis field of research has not been to the best of our \nknowledge  yet  investigated  by  the  handwriting \nrecognition  community.  However,  it  is  a  very \nchallenging application where many problems have to \nbe solved. To begin with, there is no database available \nas  handwritten  samples,  although  it  exists  a  few \nstudies involving electronic corpora, such as in [1] in \nEnglish, and [4] in French.\n3. Handwritten Short Messages corpora\nTo  assess  the  performances  of  the  proposed \nalgorithm,  we  have  collected  a  database  of French \nHandwritten  Short  Messages  (HSM).  It  contains  a \ntotal  of 1,221 HSM,  representing  38,462  characters \nand 11,600 words. The number of writers is 150, each \nhaving written from 6 to 8 HSM. As a device to collect \nthe ink, we have used a digital pen and paper solution, \nwhich allows to communicate with phones using blue-\ntooth connection. Two handwriting styles have been \nasked: isolated characters HSM, with boxed form, and \nunconstrained HSM, with only a baseline. Concerning \nthe message itself, either it was imposed to the writer, \nor conversely, we asked the writer to propose his/her \nown HSM. Table 1 synthesizes information about this \ncorpora.\nBoxed Handwriting Cursive Handwriting\nGiven text 177 174\nFree text 493 477\nTotal 670 551\nTable 1: The HSM corpora\nFig.  1  shows  an  example  HSM.  Text  written  is \n“Bizoo a2m1”, translated in standard French: “Bisous, \nà demain” (“Kiss, see you tomorrow”). In addition to \nthe on-line information, for each sample, we know the \nlabel at the HSM level.\nFig. 1: a sample HSM – boxed handwriting\nIt is cautious to note that using an electronic pen \ninstead of a small cellular phone keypad is likely to \nmodify the  structure  of input  text.  Indeed,  as  it  is \neasier to write with a pen, there might be no more \nneeds for complex abbreviations. However, we can not \nasses  the  importance  of  this  evolution  since  this \nparticular  use  will  need time  to  get  installed  (who \ncould  have  predicted  the  emergence  of  SMS  style \nlanguage ?).\n4. Baseline recognition results\n4.1. Recognition engine\nWe have used a  high  quality industrial  Software \nDevelopment  Kit  (SDK)  for  on-line  handwriting \nrecognition. This product allows to use and combine \nseveral Language Models but also to build new one, \nusing stochastic Regular Expression or lexicons (see \npart  5).  The  contribution  of  this  paper  will  be  to \ninvestigate which kind of additional resources could \nbe  developed  to  extend  the  performances  of  the \nrecognizer to process HSM.\nTwo standard French language models (Linguistic \nKnowledge  –  LK)  are  provided  with  recognition \nengine [6], they are:\n−LK-text:  for  “correctly”  written  text,  it  contains  a \nvery large lexicon of common French words, a French \nlanguage model (mostly based on n-grams of words) \nand  however,  it  enables  to recognize  out-of-lexicon \nwords.\n−LK-free: for un-characterized French text. No lexicon \nis used, but a basic language model, which performs \nonly  at  the  letter  level  to  allow  recognition  of \nunknown words.\nFig. 2 illustrates the global recognition process. As \nshown,  multiple  resources  can  be  combined  for \nrecognition, but one can also choose not to use any \nlinguistic knowledge.\nCandidate  list  of results  provided  by recognition \nengine is sorted according to a recognition score. We \nhave always considered only the first candidate. It is \nalso  worth  to  note  that  the  recognition  engine  is \nalready trained, and that neither the HSM database, \nnor the writers of this database have been involved in \nthe training stage.\n4.2. Performance assessment\nAs  the  database  is  labeled  at  the  HSM  level, \nmeasurement  of  the  recognition  rate  is  not \nstraightforward. Indeed, having a recognition rate at \nthis level would not be very meaningful, it is more \nsignificant  to  work  at  the  character  level. \nConsequently,  we have used a recognition rate derived \nfrom the  Levenshtein distance (D) computed between \nthe two strings which are the first candidate produced \nby the recognition engine and the corresponding label \nof a given HSM. The edit costs have been set to 1 for \ndeletion and substitution, and to 0 for the insertion \noperation,  in  order  to  not  penalize  twice  an  over \nsegmentation problem, which most of the time lead to \na substitution and an insertion operation.\nThe recognition rate (RR) at the character level will \nbe computed as follows:\nRR =100× (#label – D)/#label\nIt turns out that if all characters of the HSM are \nrecognized, then  D = 0, and  RR = 100%. Conversely, \nwhen  none  are  recognized,  then  D = #label,  and \nRR = 0%.  This  formulation  allows  to  bound  the \nrecognition rate between  0  and  100, but it does not \npenalize  additional  characters  in  the  recognized \nstring.\nTable  2  illustrates  this  computation  on  a  basic \nexample.\nLabel bjr #label = 3\nRecognition result loj.tRR = (3-2)/3=0.33\nTable 2: example of bad recognition, with \ninsertion\n4.3. Baseline results\nTable 3 presents recognition results with different \nlinguistic  knowledges,  for  both  unconstrained-\nhandwritten and boxed-handwritten messages. \nUsing no additional LK\n(cursive / boxed)\nUsing optimal LK\n(cursive / boxed)\nNo LK 87% / 94% 96% / 96%\nlk-text 84% / 90% 95% / 96%\nlk-free 88% / 95% 88% / 95%\nTable 3: Recognition quality for \ncursive/boxed handwriting\nFig. 2: Recognition process\nFirst  column  corresponds  to  normal  use  of  the \nrecognition  system  with  either  no  language  model, \nLK-text or LK-free resources, while in second column \nan additional optimal lexicon, which consists of the \nexact list  of words contained  in  labels, is added to \ntheses  resources.  Thus,  these  later  results  give  an \nupper bound for the recognition rate.\nClearly,  with  such  kind  of  texts  using  LK-text, \nwhich is the standard model for French text, is not \nrecommended.  Conversely,  the  LK-free resource \noutperforms slightly a recognition system without any \nlanguage model.\nIn the next section, we would like to define specific \nlanguage resources to model the main phenomena that \nalter texts, so that they can be recognized more easily \nby the recognition system.\n5. Modeling specific SMS languages\nIn  this  part,  we  present  every  language  models \ndeveloped for each phenomena.\n5.1. Consonantal skeleton\nConsonantal skeletons, as described in section 2.2, \ncan be defined either extensively with an appropriate \nlexicon  generated  from  the  standard  lexicon  using \nappropriate rules or with a more formal model based \non a stochastic regular expression. We have used later \napproach, and based on an analysis of the observed \nphenomena, we come to the model proposed in Fig. 3.\nThis  Regular  Expression  describes  the  following \nconstraints,  resulting  from  observations  on  frequent \nFrench words:\n−Most  of skeletons  (80%)  are  made  of consonants, \nwhere  a  few  vowels  can  be  kept,  for  example \n“bonjour” → “bjour”.\n−Some skeletons (20%) begin (70%) or end (7%) with \na vowel (or both: 23%).\nWe also tried to build a lexicon using a few rules to \ntransformed a word into its consonant skeleton form. \nWe obtained 3,244 words in the lexicon, covering only \n22% of the skeleton sub-corpora, due to the nature of \nthe  initial  corpora  (we used French  newspaper  “Le \nMonde”, where words such as “salut” – “hello”, very \nfrequent  in  the  consonant  skeleton  corpora  are \nobviously rare).  Using  the  lexicon  introduces  noise \nand  in  no  way  helps   improving  the recognition \nquality. We therefore choose not to use it any further. \nThat does not mean that lexicon can not be used, but a \nmore adapted corpora needs to be chosen.\nRecognition  results  concerning  consonantal \nskeleton are synthesized in part 5.4.\n5.2. Rebus\nWe proceed with  the same kind  of approach  for \nmodeling  Rebuses.  Another  Stochastic  Regular \nExpression  has  been defined. It  follows the general \nconstraints:\n−Half of rebuses are singletons, and some singletons \nare  frequent  (such  as  “2”,  used  to  replace  most \nfrequent  French  bi-gram  “de”),  whereas  others  are \nreally rare (“4” – “quatre” alone can not replace any \nfrequently used syllable in French).\n−Half of rebuses mix letters and numbers (and few \nsymbols like “+” and “-”) ; and there is no sequence of \nnumbers.\nResults  for  recognition  using  this  Regular \nExpression are detailed in part 5.4.\n5.3. Phonetic writing\nPhonetic writing is the hardest transformation to \nmodel. Indeed, from a morphological point of view, \nphonetisation does not present any specific structure, \nconversely to rebus and consonant  skeleton writing. \nHowever the process of phonetisation is quite simple: \nmost mute letters can be easily identified (for example: \n“e” after a vowel at the end of a French word) and a \nlot of simplifications can be done automatically. Thus, \nit is possible to define a  set of rules that allows to \ngenerate homophonic words from a given word. Some \nof these rules are:\n−withdrawal of mute [e] and mute consonants (mostly \nat  the  end  of  words  –  typically  [s],  mark  of  the \nplural) ;\n−withdrawal of double consonant ([ll] → [l]) ;\n−withdrawal  of  [h],  when  not  combined  with \n<c, p, s> ;\n−miscellaneous transformations ([au] → [o] ; [qu,  c] \n→ [k] ; [ç] → [c] ; [ai, é, è, ais, ait] → [é, è]) ;\nEvery possible transformations are applied to each \nwords and  to the results  of the transformation.  For \nexample,  starting  with  the  word  “musique”  we \ngenerated the list “muzique,  musiqu,  musike,  musike, \nmuziqu, muzike, musik, muzik”\nFig 3: Stochastic Finite State Automata for \nConsonant Skeleton\nWe have selected the most frequent French words, \nfrom a corpora based on the newspaper “Le Monde”, \nand then have automatically applied the above rules to \nproduce  a  new  lexicon  that  contains  all  the \nhomophonic  words.  In  this  experiment,  3,171 \nhomophonic words from most frequent 1,200 French \nwords have been used.\n5.4. Results\nWe have manually classified each HSM in one of \nthe  four  categories:  consonant  skeleton,  rebus, \nphonetic style, and others. 54 consonant skeleton-style \n(151  char.)  ;  96  rebus-like  (222  char.)  ;  and  91 \nphonetic-style (327 char.) samples were extracted from \nBoxed-HSM corpora.  Then we applied the proposed \nadditional  resources  to  the  recognition  system  and \ncompare with the baseline results (lower bound: best \nresult  without  any  modification  of  the  initial  LK \nprovided),  and  with  the  optimal  lexicon  (upper \nbound).  Table  4  synthesizes  results  for  all  three \nphenomena.\nLower Bound Proposed LK Upper Bound\nConsonant \nSkeleton Style\n94.7% 98.0% 100%\nRebus Style 92.6% 92.6% 94.6%\nPhonetic Style 94.1% 94.1% 99.3%\nTable 4: Recognition Result using proposed \nlanguage models\nThose results require explanations. In the case of \nthe consonant skeleton style, the quality is improved \n(better said: nearly 38% of initial errors get corrected). \nIn  the  cases  of  Rebus  Style  and  Phonetic  Style, \nimprovement  is  not  directly  visible.  Nevertheless, \nmore detailed results (see table 5) show that proposed \nlanguage  models  greatly improved  initial  RR when \ncombined with standard French language models (LK-\ntext).\nLK-text LK-text + \nproposed LK\nLK-text + \noptimal\nConsonant \nSkeleton Style\n66.2% 98.0% 98.0%\nRebus Style 69.1% 92.1% 94.6%\nPhonetic Style 75.2% 90.5% 99.0%\nTable 5: Recognition results using lk-text and \nproposed LK\nTable  5  clearly  indicates  that  proposed  models \nbrings a lot of useful information to a poorly adapted \ninitial  LK.  Nevertheless,  those  result  are  yet  worst \nthan results found using proposed LK only. The  LK-\ntext LK is over constrainted and in all case inadequate \nfor  HSM  recognition.  Combining  LK-text with \nproposed LK helps correcting  nearly 62% of initial \nerrors in the case of Phonetic Style, and 75% of initial \nerrors in the case of rebus style.\n6. Conclusion\nAlthough SMS are now very common, only a few \nstudies has been conducted around this new way of \ncommunication. Our work, in the field of this study, \nwas first  to describe and  understand  precisely each \nphenomena to be able to characterize them within the \nrecognition engine. This is an arduous task since those \nphenomena  are  essentially  creative  and  un-\nconstrainted,  and  bringing  too  much  or  too  less \ninformation to the recognition engine would just lower \nthe quality of the recognition results. \nWe introduced here some successful propositions \nfor characterizing isolated, known transformations. A \nlot of work is still to be done: some transformation has \nnot been treated yet and proceeding combinations of \nthose transformations as shown in part 2.4. is far from \nbeing  an  easy task.  Finally,  to  be  able  to  perform \nhandwritten SMS recognition, some works need to be \ndone  to finely tune  and  combine  introduced  LK in \norder  to build a  global SMS Linguistic Knowledge. \nIndeed, we hereby worked on isolated phenomena, but \nwe  would  have  needed  more  control  onto  the \nrecognition engine. We could only use it as a black \nbox, with LK combinations, and were not able to tune \nit up finely enough to integrate efficiently our work.\n7.
