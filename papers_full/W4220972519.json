    "abstract": "Nanotechnology provides an effective way to upgrade the thermophysical characteristics of dielectric oils and creates optimal transformer design. The properties of insulation materials have a significant effect on the optimal transformer design. Ester-based nanofluids (NF) are introduced as an energy-efficient alternative to conventional mineral oils, prepared by dispersing nanoparticles in the base oil. This study presents the effect of nanoparticles on the thermophysical properties of pure natural ester (NE) and synthetic ester (SE) oils with temperature varied from ambient temperature up to 80 °C. A range of concentrations of graphene oxide (GO) and TiO2 nanoparticles were used in the study to upgrade the thermophysical properties of ester-based oils. The experiments for thermal conductivity and viscosity were performed using a TC-4 apparatus that follows Debby’s concept and a redwood viscometer apparatus that follows the ASTM-D445 experimental standard, respectively. The experimental results show that nanoparticles have a positive effect on the thermal conductivity and viscosity of oils which reduces with an increase in temperature.",
