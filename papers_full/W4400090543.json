    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives The surge in patient portal messages (PPMs) with increasing needs and workloads for efficient PPM triage in healthcare settings has spurred the exploration of AI-driven solutions to streamline the healthcare workflow processes, ensuring timely responses to patients to satisfy their healthcare needs. However, there has been less focus on isolating and understanding patient primary concerns in PPMs—a practice which holds the potential to yield more nuanced insights and enhances the quality of healthcare delivery and patient-centered care. Materials and Methods We propose a fusion framework to leverage pretrained language models (LMs) with different language advantages via a Convolution Neural Network for precise identification of patient primary concerns via multi-class classification. We examined 3 traditional machine learning models, 9 BERT-based language models, 6 fusion models, and 2 ensemble models. Results The outcomes of our experimentation underscore the superior performance achieved by BERT-based models in comparison to traditional machine learning models. Remarkably, our fusion model emerges as the top-performing solution, delivering a notably improved accuracy score of 77.67 ± 2.74% and an F1 score of 74.37 ± 3.70% in macro-average. Discussion This study highlights the feasibility and effectiveness of multi-class classification for patient primary concern detection and the proposed fusion framework for enhancing primary concern detection. Conclusions The use of multi-class classification enhanced by a fusion of multiple pretrained LMs not only improves the accuracy and efficiency of patient primary concern identification in PPMs but also aids in managing the rising volume of PPMs in healthcare, ensuring critical patient communications are addressed promptly and accurately.",
