However, high supply voltage and\nhigh cost limit the applications of these PAs. To lower the\ncost, watt-level CMOS analog PAs were developed in the past\ndecades. The cascode and stacked PAs are introduced to over-\ncome the limitation from low breakdown voltage of CMOS\ntransistors [5]–[11]. Such implementations allow the operation\nat higher supply voltage while keeping reliability. However,\nthe operating points have to be carefully selected so that the\ndevices operate optimally [12]. Moreover, these PAs still need\nhigh supply voltage and show relatively low efﬁciency. CMOS\ndigital PAs (DPAs) are developed with signiﬁcant merits\nof high efﬁciency and high integration level [13]–[25]. The\npolar architecture [26] and IQ cell sharing [27] are attractive\nfor high-power applications. Besides, to achieve watt-level\noutput power with limited supply voltage, the on-chip power-\ncombining technique is developed. Recently, the watt-level\nCMOS DPAs are developed with competitive efﬁciency and\nrelatively low supply voltage [28]–[35]. However, the match-\ning networks of these DPAs are normally ﬁxed, which limit\nthe operation bandwidth (BW).\nThe reconﬁgurable matching network is introduced for\nextended operation BW and enhanced efﬁciency in PA design.\nThe impedance of such a matching network can be adjusted\nto meet the design requirements of optimized load impedance\n(Z\nopt) for PA implementation in a wide frequency range. The\nswitched capacitor [36] and dynamic matching network [37]\nare proposed to improve the output power and efﬁciency\nfor enhanced operation BW. The dynamic load trajectory\nmanipulation with switch-controlled capacitors is reported\nin [38] to optimize the PA load impedance during power back-\noff. Besides, a programmable capacitor array is introduced in\nswitched capacitor PA (SCPA) for frequency tuning [39]. The\nreconﬁgurable matching network and programmable network\nused in these works can effectively enhance the operation\nBW and improve PA efﬁciency. However, the saturated output\npower of these works is lower than 25 dBm. For higher power\napplications, the circuit reliability and extra loss of switches\nare key challenges to design reconﬁgurable matching network.\nOnce the 2-W power is delivered into a 50-\u0002 load, a nearly\n28.3-V peak-to-peak voltage sw ing is generated, which is\nmuch higher than the supply voltage of advanced-scaling\nCMOS transistor.

Furthermore, large dynamic range and low LO\nleakage are demanded in DPA design to support high-order\nmodulation signals [40]. Therefore, it is still challenging\nto achieve watt-level DPA with wideband operation, high\nefﬁciency, and low LO leakage using CMOS technology.\nTo address these challenges, this article presents a wideband\nwatt-level 12-bit polar DPA with large dynamic range using\na reconﬁgurable power-combining transformer [41]. First, the\ntunable inductor is proposed with enhanced reliability. The\ntheory of tunable inductor is analyzed. Based on the tunable\ninductor, the reconﬁgurable power-combining transformer is\nproposed in the watt-level DPA to extend the operation BW\nwith improved reliability. Meanwhile, the harmonics are sup-\npressed by L–C circuits, which further improve the output\npower of the fundamental signal.In addition, the 12-bit power\ndigital-to-analog (power DAC) with isolation enhancement is\nused to achieve high-resolution amplitude control and LO leak-\nage suppression. Then, large dynamic range can be achieved\nto support high-order modulation, such as 1024-QAM and\n4096-QAM.\nThis article is organized as follows. Section II introduces the\narchitecture of the proposed wideband watt-level CMOS DPA.\nSection III discusses the matching network of the proposed\nDPA with a reconﬁgurable power-combining transformer,\nwhere the theory and impleme ntation are clearly analyzed\nand explained. The implementation of sub-DPA with harmonic\nsuppression is presented in Section IV. Section V shows the\nmeasurement results and comparisons with state-of-the-arts.\nFinally, the conclusion is given in Section VI.\nII. A\nRCHITECTURE OF WATT-LEVEL DPA\nThe architecture of the proposed wideband watt-level DPA\nis shown in Fig. 1. Such DPA consists of the output matching\nnetwork with a reconﬁgurable power-combining transformer,\nharmonic suppression circuit, and two identical differential\nsub-DPAs. The Class-E switching PA is chosen for the\nunit cell of sub-DPA. Two differential sub-DPAs are power-\ncombined to improve the output power, while a reconﬁgurable\npower-combining transformer is used to extend the operation\nBW. Each differential sub-DPA is constituted of the 6-bit\nMSB unit cells controlled by thermometer code and 6-bit\nFig. 2.

(b) Model of the single-ended\nClass-E PA with a reconﬁgurable power-combining matching network.\nLSB unit cells controlled by the binary code. The 12-bit unit\ncells lead to a high-resolution amplitude control for high-order\nmodulation. To obtain higher output voltage swing, the 2.5-V\nthick-oxide transistors are used to implement both the MSB\nand LSB unit cells. The LO leakage is also suppressed by the\n2.5-V thick-oxide transistors. Therefore, a large dynamic range\ncan be achieved. Meanwhile, considering the reliability, the\ncascode topology is introduced in unit cell design. TheL–C\nbased circuits are introduced to suppress the harmonics, which\ncould further improve the output power of the fundamental\nsignal. The 2.5-V digital\nAND gates with buffers combine the\nphase-modulated (PM) signal and thermometer/binary codes,\nwhich drive the MSB and LSB unit cells. Two parallel 1:6\ndeserializers are introduced in each sub-DPA to convert the\nserial input baseband signals BB\nH and BB L into parallel\nsignals H < 5 : 0 > and L < 5 : 0 >, respectively. Two\nsampling clocks CLKH and CLKL (CLKH = 6CLKL )a r e\nrequired in each deserializer . The encoders transform the\nH < 5 : 0 > and L < 5 : 0 > signals to thermometer and\nbinary control codes. The level shift circuits convert 1.1-V\nrail-to-rail output signals of encoders into 2.5-V signals,\nwhich drive the digital\nAND gates. Note that the baseband\nsignals and sampling clocks are shared for each sub-DPA.\nIII. R ECONFIGURABLE POWER -COMBINING\nMATCHING NETWORK\nTo discuss the matching network design of watt-level DPA,\nthe model of the single-ended Class-E PA with ﬁnite dc-feed\ninductance L\n1 and switch ON-resistance RON is shown in\nFig. 2(a). RX is the parasitic resistor. Considering the ideal\nimpedance transform network with a turn ratio of 1:n,t h e\noutput power on the effective loadR can be calculated by\nPout = VDD2 p(q,m)2\n2KL1 (q,m)2 × 1\nR2\nX\nR + R + 2RX\n.

Equivalent circuit and schematic of (a) proposed tunable inductor and\n(b) conventional directly connected tuning network using tunable capacitor.\nThe drain efﬁciency (DE) can be evaluated by\nη = R\nRX + R\n(\n1 −\n∫π\nω\n0\n(VCon(t)2)dt\nVDD\n∫π\nω\n0 VCon(t)dt\n)\n. (2)\nwhere VCON is the transient voltage across capacitor C1 in\nthe time interval 0 ≤ t ≤ ω/π. The design parameters\n(i.e., KL1 and p) of the model can be expressed by the free\ndesign variables q = 1/(ω√\nL1C1) and m = ωRON C1 [42].\nThe parasitic resistance RX should be much smaller than\nR = RL /n2 for higher DE. With limited supply voltage VDD\nin the conventional CMOS technology, a smaller impedance\nR = RL /n2 should be adopted to achieve watt-level output\npower. Therefore, the transformation network with larger turn\nratio n is needed to convert the smaller impedance R into\nRL . However, the loss of the transformation network usually\nincreases with larger turn ration, which would further decrease\nthe PA efﬁciency. Besides, toobtain wideband operation, the\nmatching network should be ﬁnely designed to meet the design\nrequirement of R in a wide frequency range.\nIn this work, the matching network with a reconﬁgurable\npower-combining transformer is introduced, as shown in\nFig. 2(b). The tunable inductor with enhanced reliability\nunder high voltage swing and high quality factor is intro-\nduced in reconﬁgurable transf ormer design. The matching\nnetwork with reconﬁgurable transformer can be reconﬁgured\nto meet the design requirement of Z\nopt in a wide frequency\nrange. Moreover, the voltage-mode power-combining tech-\nnique, which needs lower impedance turn ratio compared with\nthe current-mode combining technique [43], [44], is used to\nfurther improve the output power of the proposed DPA.\nA. Reconﬁgurable Transformer\nThe equivalent circuit of the tunable inductor is shown in\nFig. 3(a) (i.e., Type I). R\n1 is the parasitic resistor of the\ninductor L1. The extra inductor Lt connected to the tunable\ncapacitor Ct is coupled to L1 with a coupling factor of\nk1t . Rt is the parasitic resistance of the tuning network.L1e\nand Q1e are the equivalent inductance and qualify factor of\nFig. 4. (a) Calculated Q1e and Q2e when only Rt is changed (L1 = 1n H ,\nR1 = 1 \u0002, Lt = 500 pH, k1t = 0.5, and Ct = Ct2 = 1 pF). (b) Calculated\nQ1e and Q2e when L1e = L2e (L1 = 1n H ,R1 = 1 \u0002, Lt = 500 pH, k1t =\n0.5, and Rt = 0.5 \u0002).\nthe tunable inductor, respectively. The conventional directly\nconnected tuning network using tunable capacitorCt2 is shown\nin Fig. 3(b) (i.e., Type II). The tunable capacitor Ct2 with\nthe parasitic resistor Rt is connected to the inductorL1. L2e\nand Q2e are the equivalent inductance and qualify factor of\nType II, respectively.L1e, L2e, Q1e,a n dQ2e can be calculated\nand compared. The corresponding equations and derivations\nin detail are shown in Appendix A. The calculated Q1e\nand Q2e across Rt are shown in Fig. 4(a). The proposed\ntunable inductor (i.e., Type I) shows higherQ compared with\nType II. Meanwhile, when Rt increases, the quality factor\ndegradation of Type I is less than Type II. In addition, the\ntunable capacitors Ct and Ct2 are ﬁnely adjusted to tune\nL1e and L2e, respectively. The calculatedQ1e and Q2e under\nthe case of L1e = L2e are shown in Fig. 4(b). The directly\ntuning network introduces a critical effect onQ2e. Meanwhile,\nthe proposed tunable inductor shows a little Q degradation\nwhen L1e is tuned. Therefore, compared with the conventional\ntuning network using directly connected tunable capacitor,\nthe proposed tunable inductor indirectly affects the winding\nthrough EM coupling, which introduces less loss.\nBased on the tunable inductor, the equivalent circuit and\nschematic of two-port reconﬁgurable transformer are shown in\nFig. 5(a). L p is the primary inductor of the transformer with\nthe parasitic resistor Rp. The secondary inductorLs with the\nparasitic resistor Rs is coupled toL p with coupling factorkps .\nThe extra inductorLt with the parasitic resistorRt is coupled\nto Ls with coupling coefﬁcient kst . By tuning the capacitor\nCt , which is connected with Lt , the equivalent secondary\ninductance L′\nse can be adjusted. Note that the undesired weak\ncoupling kpt between L p and Lt is hard to be eliminated in\npractical implementation. Thus,kpt is considered in principle\nanalysis, which would slightly affect the equivalent primary\ninductance L′\npe and equivalent resistance R′\npe . R′\nse is the\nequivalent resistance of L′\nse . k′\npse represents the equivalent\ncoupling coefﬁcient of the transformer.\n[ZTA ] =\n⎡\n⎢⎢⎣\nRp + jωL p +\nω2k2\npt L p Lt\nRt + jωLt − j/(ωCt ) jωkps\n√\n L p Ls + ω2kst kpt Lt\n√\n L p Ls\nRt + jωLt − j/(ωCt )\njωkps\n√\n L p Ls + ω2kst kpt Lt\n√\n L p Ls\nRt + jωLt − j/(ωCt ) Rs + jωLs + ω2k2\nst Ls Lt\nRt + jωLt − j/(ωCt )\n⎤\n⎥⎥⎦ (3)\n360 IEEE JOURNAL OF SOLID-STATE CIRCUITS, VOL. 58, NO. 2, FEBRUARY 2023\nFig. 5.

(9)\nTo achieve higher output power, the power-combining\ntechnique using transformer is usually used in integrated\ncircuit design. The voltage-mode power-combining trans-\nformer, which requires lower impedance turn ratio com-\npared with the current-mode power-combining transformer\n[43], [44], is adopted in this work. The reconﬁgurable\nvoltage-mode power-combining transformer is proposed as\nshown in Fig. 5(b). The corresponding impedance matrix\n[Z\nTB ] of such a three-port network can be derived and\nexpressed by (10), shown at the bottom of the page. The weak\ncoupling between primary inductors is ignored. The equiv-\nalent inductances L\nse , L pe , equivalent resistances Rse , Rpe ,\nequivalent quality factors Q pe , Qse , and equivalent coupling\ncoefﬁcient kpse can be calculated by the following equations:\nL pe = imag([ZTB ]11)\nω = L p +\nωk2\npt L p Lt [1/(ωCt )−2ωLt ]\n4R2\nt +[ 2ωLt − 1/(ωCt )]2\n(11)\nLse = imag([ZTB ]33)\n2ω = Ls + 2ωk2\nst Ls Lt [1/(ωCt )−2ωLt ]\n4R2\nt +[ 2ωLt − 1/(ωCt )]2\n(12)\nRpe = real([ZTB ]11) = Rp +\n2ω2k2\npt L p Lt Rt\n4R2\nt +[ 2ωLt − 1/(ωCt )]2\n(13)\nRse = real([ZTB ]33)\n2 = Rs + 4ω2k2\nst Ls Lt Rt\n4R2\nt +[ 2ωLt − 1/(ωCt )]2\n(14)\nQ pe,se = ωL pe,se\nRpe,se\n(15)\nkpse = imag([ZTB ]31)/ω\n√\n Lse × L pe\n. (16)\nIt can be seen that the equivalent secondary inductance\nLse is affected by Ct , Lt , kpt ,a n d Rt . By tuning Ct , Lse\ncan be controlled to tune the input impedance of the net-\nwork. Therefore, it is possible to design the reconﬁgurable\nmatching network for enhanced BW based on the proposed\nreconﬁgurable power-combining transformer. Following the\naforementioned theories and equations, we can easily design\ntunable inductor and reconﬁgurable transformer for different\nrequirements.\nB. Implementation of Matching Network With Reconﬁgurable\nPower-Combining Transformer\nAs shown in Fig. 6, the proposed reconﬁgurable matching\nnetwork is implemented by a reconﬁgurable power-combining\ntransformer, four switched capacitorsC\nd at inputs, and ﬁxed\ncapacitor Co at output. Considering the reliability problem\nof CMOS switch under high voltage swing after power-\ncombining, the output capacitor C\no is set to be ﬁxed. The\nswitched capacitor banks Ct and Cd are used for the recon-\nﬁgurable matching network. Cd is composed of a switched\ncapacitor Cd2 of 3.5 pF and a ﬁxed capacitorCd1 of 2.7 pF.\nThe capacitance of Cd is 6.2 pF with Q of 31.5 when Cd2\n[ZTB ]=\n⎡\n⎢⎢\n⎢\n⎢\n⎢\n⎢\n⎢⎣\nR\np + jωL p +\nω2k2\npt L p Lt\n2Rt + j2ωLt − j/(ωCt ) 0 jωk ps\n√\n L p Ls + 2ω2kst k pt Lt\n√\n L p Ls\n2Rt + j2ωLt − j/(ωCt )\n0 Rp + jωL p +\nω2k2\npt L p Lt\n2Rt + j2ωLt − j/(ωCt ) jωk ps\n√\n L p Ls + 2ω2kst k pt Lt\n√\n L p Ls\n2Rt + j2ωLt − j/(ωCt )\njωk ps\n√\n L p Ls + 2ω2kst k pt Lt\n√\n L p Ls\n2Rt + j2ωLt − j/(ωCt ) jωk ps\n√\n L p Ls + 2ω2kst k pt Lt\n√\n L p Ls\n2Rt + j2ωLt − j/(ωCt ) 2Rs + j2ωLs + 4ω2k2\nst Ls Lt\n2Rt + j2ωLt − j/(ωCt )\n⎤\n⎥⎥\n⎥\n⎥\n⎥\n⎥\n⎥⎦\n(10)\nY ANGet al.: CMOS WIDEBAND W ATT-LEVEL 4096-QAM DPA 361\nFig. 6.

The switched-ON Ct is 2.5 pF\nwith Q of 40.1, while the switched-OFF Ct is 0.6 pF withQ\nof 31.7 at 2 GHz. The top three thick metal layers (i.e., ALPA,\nUTM, and TM) are used to implement the power-combining\ntransformer for higher quality factors and enough current\ncapability.\nL\np and Ls are the primary and secondary inductors of the\ntransformer, respectively. Lt connected with Ct is coupled to\nLs with coupling coefﬁcient ofkst . The equivalent secondary\ninductance Lse can be adjusted by tuning Ct . However, due\nto the undesired weak coupling kpt , L pe would be slightly\naffected when Ct is tuning. The calculated and EM-simulated\nLse , Qse , L pe, Q pe ,a n d kpse at 2.4 GHz are compared\nin Fig. 7. The calculated results are based on (11)–(16).\nThe parameters ( L p, Q p, Ls , Qs , kps , Lt , Qt , kst ,a n d\nkpt ) are extracted from the EM-simulated results. To avoid\nthe undesired inﬂuences introduced by parasitics of practical\ncapacitors and switches, the ideal model of tunable capacitors\nis used in the calculation and simulation. The calculated and\nEM-simulated results show good agreement. The equivalent\nsecondary inductance L\nse is adjusted in a relatively large\nrange whenCt is tuning. Meanwhile,L pe and kpse are slightly\naffected by Ct . In addition, the proposed transformer shows\nlittle degradation of Q pe and Qse when Ct is increased.\nThe impedance ZL of the matching network could be\ncontrolled by tuning Ct or Cd . ZL is simulated at different\nfrequencies, as shown in Fig. 8. When the capacitor Cd is\ntuned and Ct is switched OFF, the simulated tuning ranges of\nZL at different frequencies are expressed by the red curves.\nZL is only obtained in a small range, which could not meet the\ndesign requirement ofZopt in wideband. Meanwhile, by adjust-\ning both Ct and Cd , the tuning range of impedanceZL (the\nblue region) could be further extended, which ﬁnely meets\nthe optimum load impedanceZopt in a wide frequency range.\nTherefore, the proposed reconﬁgurable matching network can\nenhance the operation BW of the proposed DPA.\nTwo optimized operation modes (i.e., Modes I and II) are\nused to optimize the impedance matching at different frequen-\ncies for enhanced BW. To evaluate the passive efﬁciency of\nthe proposed matching network under two operation modes,\nFig. 7. Calculated and EM-simulated equivalent Lse , L pe , Qse , Q pe ,a n d\nk pse at 2.4 GHz based on (11)–(16) (L p = 267 pH, Q p = 16.59, Ls =\n960 pH, Qs = 13.59, k ps = 0.741, Lt = 245 pH, Qt = 8.69, kst = 0.513,\nand k pt = 0.29 at 2.4 GHz).\nthe single-ended equivalent circuit of the matching network\nbased on the reconﬁgurable power-combining transformer is\nshown in Fig. 9.

First, the input\nimpedance Zin 1 can be expressed by the following equation\nbased on (17) and (18):\nZin 1 = V1\nI1\n=[ ZTB ]11 −[ ZTB ]13\nI ′\n3\nI1\n=[ ZTB ]11 −[ ZTB ]13\n2[ZTB ]31\nRL 1\n2 j ωCo\nRL + 1\n2 j ωCo\n+[ ZTB ]33\n.

(20)\nThe input power of port 1 can be calculated using the following\nequation:\nPin = real(Iin × I ∗\nin × Zin 2) (21)\nwhere\nZin 2 =\nZin 1 1\njωCd\nZin 1 + 1\njωCd\n. (22)\nThe output power delivered to the loadRL should be calcu-\nlated. Considering the output capacitor 2Co, the output current\nIout of the load RL can be expressed by\nIout = 1\n2 jωCo(RL + 1\n2 jωCo ) I ′\n3. (23)\nThe output power delivered to the loadRL can be evaluated\nusing the following equation:\nPout = real(Iout × I ∗\nout × RL ). (24)\nThe input power of port 2 is identical to port 1. Therefore,\nthe passive efﬁciency of the proposed matching network can\nbe calculated by\neff. = P\nout\nPin + Pin\n× 100%. (25)\nTo obtain more accurate calculation result of passive efﬁ-\nciency in a wide frequency range, the frequency-dependent\nparameters of the reconﬁgurable power-combining transformer\n(i.e., L p, Ls , Lt , Q p, Qs , Qt , kps , kpt ,a n d kst )a r e\nconsidered in calculation. The simulation results of these\nfrequency-dependent parameters versus frequency are shown\nin Fig. 10. It can be seen thatL p and Ls show good quality\nfactors in a wide frequency range, which beneﬁts the passive\nefﬁciency. The calculated and simulated passive efﬁciencies\nof the proposed matching network under two operation modes\n(i.e., Modes I and II) are compared in Fig. 11, which show\ngood agreement. It can be seen that the passive efﬁciency\nof the proposed network is larger than 67% in the operation\nBW. The calculation results shown in Fig. 11 assume that all\nthe input impedances of the power combiner are identical.\nHowever, due to the asymmetric layout of the voltage-type\ncombiner when using a single-ended output, the imbalances of\nthis type of combiner exist. Such imbalances lead to unequal\nimpedances at each input port of the power-combining trans-\nformer [45]. Therefore, the mismatch between the simulation\nand calculation is mainly caused by the imbalance of the layout\nfor the proposed transformer.\nTo enhance the reliability of switch, the circuits of cascode\nthick-oxide MOSFETs are used to implement the switched\ncapacitor C\nd . As discussed in Appendix A, to improve the\nreliability of Ct after power-combining, the ratio of Lt /Ls\nshould be low, which limits the voltage swing across Ct ,\nas shown in Fig. 6(c).

Thus, the single 2.5-V thick-oxide transistor is used to\nimplement the switched capacitorCt with good reliability.\nIV . POWER DAC WITH LO LEAKAGE AND\nHARMONIC SUPPRESSION\nThe conﬁguration of the 12-bit power-DAC with the 6-bit\nMSB and 6-bit LSB unit cells is shown in Fig. 13. The\ndimensions of each transistor for the 6-bit MSB are set\nto 72.5 μm/270 nm. The sizes of the cascode devices for\nthe 6-bit LSB are 36.25, 18.13, 9.065, 4.54, 2.27, and\n1.135 μm/270 nm, respectively. The outputs of sub-DPAs\nare connected to the reconﬁgurable matching network. The\nFig. 12.

Cross section view and simulated LO leakage of Types A and B.\n2.5-V thick-oxide transistors are set to be minimized value\nof 40 and 270 nm, respectively. With identical ratio of\nwidth/length, the power DAC based on 2.5-V thick-oxide tran-\nsistors features lower LO leakage. In addition, the thick-oxide\ntransistors with 2.5-V supply shows higher output power.\nTherefore, the thick-oxide transistors are used to implement\nthe 12-bit power-DAC for watt-level output power and rela-\ntively low LO leakage in this work. In addition, considering\nthe reliability, the cascode structure is introduced in unit cell\ndesign, which handles higher voltage stress.\nMeanwhile, the EM coupling introduced by routings of\npower DAC further deteriorates the LO leakage. The cross\nsection views of two types of sub-PA routings are depicted in\nFig. 15. Type A and Type B are the proposed and conventional\nrouting schemes, respectively. The weak coupling between PM\ninput routing and output routing of the sub-PA further deterio-\nrates LO leakage. The GND implemented using stacked metal\nlayer is introduced in this work (i.e., Type A), which improves\nthe isolation between input–output and further decreases the\nLO leakage. The simulatedLO leakage of Types A and B is\ncompared in Fig. 15. Type A introduces more than 15-dB LO\nleakage suppression improvement compared with Type B.\nThe L–C circuit is introduced in each sub-DPA as shown\nin Fig. 13, which could generate a transmission zero at\nabout 4 GHz to suppress the third harmonic of the funda-\nmental signal at lower frequency. The inductorL\nn ,w h i c hi s\nimplemented using top thick metal layers, is 458 pH with a\nquality factor of 15.5. TheL–C-based harmonic suppression\ncircuit is controlled by the switchSW . The single thick-oxide\ntransistor is used to design the switchSW . The simulated peak-\nto-peak voltage swing across the switch SW is only about\n1.4 V at 2 GHz. As illustrated in Fig. 16, when the proposed\nDPA operates at lower frequencies,SW is switched ON.T h e\nthird harmonics of the fundamental signals are suppressed.\nMeanwhile, the impedance matching is further optimized by\nthe harmonic suppression circuit, which contributes to the\nimproved output power of the fundamental signals. The simu-\nlated transient drain voltage of the cascode unit cell with and\nwithout harmonic suppression at 2 GHz is shown in Fig. 17.\nFig. 16. Simulated effect of harmonic suppression circuit.\nFig. 17. Simulated transient drain v oltage of cascode unit cell with and\nwithout harmonic suppression at 2 GHz.\nFig. 18. Chip microphotograph.\nV. FABRICATION AND MEASUREMENT\nThe proposed watt-level DPA is fabricated using a conven-\ntional 40-nm CMOS technology occupying 2 mm× 1.3 mm\nincluding all I/O pads. The core circuit is only 1.46 mm×\n0.55 mm. The microphotograph of the fabricated DPA is\nshown in Fig. 18. The supply voltage is 1.1/2.5 V . The mea-\nsurement setup is shown in Fig. 19. The chip is wirebonded\non a PCB for measurement. For modulation measurement, the\nvector signal generator generates the PM signal. The wideband\nbalun converts the signal of the vector signal generator into\ndifferential, which feeds the proposed DPA through GSSG\nprobe.

Measurement setup.\nare generated by the arbitrary waveform generator (AWG).\nBesides, the output signal of the proposed DPA is attenuated\nby a 20-dB attenuator and measured by the spectrum analyzer.\nThe measured saturated output powerPsat, DE, and power-\nadded efﬁciency (PAE) versus frequency are depicted in\nFig. 20(a). The proposed DPA features a peak P\nsat of\n32.67 dBm with 45.1% DE and peak PAE of 35.5% at 2 GHz.\nThe power dissipation of core circuits, driving circuits, digital\ncircuits, and all the logic blocks is considered in PAE calcu-\nlation. Two optimized operation modes (i.e., Modes I and II)\nare adopted to optimize the output impedance of the DPA\nat different frequencies, which leads to BW enhancement.\nThe 1-dB BW of operation Mode I is about 1.45–2.4 GHz.\nMeanwhile, the 1-dB BW of operation Mode II is about\n1.7–2.85 GHz, which effectively extends the operation BW\nof the proposed DPA. The 3-dB BW of the proposed DPA\nis 1.2–3.6 GHz, i.e., 100% FBW. Besides, the proposed DPA\nexhibits the LO leakage of−82.97 dBm and dynamic range\nof 115.64 dB at 2 GHz, as shown in Fig. 20(b). The dynamic\nrange is deﬁned as the difference between the maximal and\nminimal output power of DPA [40].\nThe measured typical AM–AM and AM–PM distortions\nof the proposed DPA at 2.4 and 3.5 GHz are shown in\nFig. 20(c). The AM–PM distortion is mainly caused by the\nvarying output impedance of transistors versus code. Two 1-D\ndigital predistortions (DPDs) with lookup table are required to\nenhance both the amplitude and phase linearity of the DPA.\nThe AM–AM distortion is minimized by the DPD with AWG.\nMeanwhile, the AM–PM distortion of the DPA is improved\nby the DPD with a vector signal generator. As illustrated in\nFig. 21, the constellation and spectrum of the 256-QAM sig-\nnals are measured at differentfrequencies. Note that limited by\nthe 200-MHz sampling rate of the vector signal generator, the\nmaximal symbol rate is 50 MSym/s with 4 upsampling ratio.\n10 000 symbols are measured in the modulation measurement.\nAt 1.8 GHz, the 25-MSym/s 256-QAM modulation signals\nare measured, which exhibit the average output power (P\navg)\nof 24.85 dBm, average PAE of 16.94%, EVM of−31.37 dB,\nand adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR) of−32.05 dBc.\nAt 2.4 GHz, the 25-MSym/s 256-QAM modulation signals\nare measured. They featureP\navg of 25.48 dBm, average PAE\nof 18.82%, EVM of−32.11 dB, and ACLR of−32.83 dBc.\nMeanwhile, at 3.5 GHz, the 50-MSym/s 256-QAM modulation\nFig. 20.

To achieve higher\ndata rate, the higher order QAM signal (e.g., the 4096-QAM)\nshould be supported by the future wireless transmission sys-\ntem. The 4096-QAM is introduced in IEEE 802.11 be (i.e.,\nWi-Fi 7) for peak data rate improvement.

The mod-\nulation test further demonstrates that the proposed polar DPA\ncould support maximal 50-MHz 256-QAM signal and 5-MHz\n4096-QAM signal.\nVI. C\nONCLUSION\nIn this article, a wideband watt-level polar DPA is pro-\nposed. The reconﬁgurable power-combining transformer is\nintroduced to further enhance the operation BW and improve\nthe output power. The detailed theories and operation of the\nreconﬁgurable power-combining transformer based on tunable\ninductor are discussed. Meanwhile, the L–C circuit is used\nto suppress the harmonic. The 12-bit power-DAC featuring\nhigh resolution and dynamic range is introduced to support\nhigh-order modulation signals. The proposed DPA fabricated\nin the 40-nm CMOS technology shows the merits of wideband,\nhigh efﬁciency, watt-level output power, and low LO leakage,\nwhich are attractive for multi-standard wireless communica-\ntion applications.\nA\nPPENDIX A\nThe equivalent circuit of the tunable inductor is shown in\nFig. 3(a) (i.e., Type I).Z11 of such a one-port network can be\nexpressed by\nZ11 = R1 + jωL1 + ω2k2\n1t L1 Lt\nRt + jωLt − j/(ωCt ).

(27)\nIt can be seen thatL1e is affected byL1, Lt , Ct , k1t ,a n dRt .\nThe equivalent quality factorQ1e of the tunable inductor can\nbe expressed by (28), shown at the bottom of the next page.\nTo discuss the effect ofCt , Lt , k1t ,a n dRt , the calculatedL1e\nand Q1e at 2.4 GHz using (27) and (28) are shown in Fig. 27(a)\nand (b), respectively. The inductor withL1 = 1000 pH and\nR1 = 1 \u0002 at 2.4 GHz is adopted. Various values ofCt , Lt ,\nk1t ,a n dRt are analyzed when 1/(ωCt ) >ω Lt .A ss h o w n\nin Fig. 27(a), L1e can be adjusted in a relatively large range\nwhen Ct is tuning.

Equation (31) can be simpliﬁed as\nVt = k1t\n1 − ω2 Lt\n(\n1 − k2\n1t\n)\nCt\n√\nLt\nL1\nV1.

Therefore, it is\npossible to limitVt for enhanced reliability by decreasing the\nratio of Lt /L1 even when V1 is much higher thanVt .\nAPPENDIX B\nThe schematic of the two-port reconﬁgurable transformer\nis shown in Fig. 28.
