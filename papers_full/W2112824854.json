The second is to distinguish “affordance” from a schema of the\ntool; when we talk about anticipation, don’t we just mean the ability to call on a schema\nrepresenting a “recipe” for usingthat tool for that task? This question of representation,\nspeciﬁcally what knowledge needs to be represented in tool use, is central to this\npaper.\nKeywords: distributed cognition, tool use, affordances, representation, extended mind, systems dynamics\nINTRODUCTION\nThe central question for this paper is what representations are\nemployed when using tools? In this paper, the term “representa-\ntion” is taken to mean a set of parameters which describe an action\n(from goal to execution). In broad terms, one answer to this ques-\ntion might see the set of parameters as being speciﬁed prior to an\naction being performed, e.g., in the form of an action schema, or\nas being recruited in preparation of the action, e.g., in the form\nof activation of speciﬁc brain regions. In this case, the question\nbecomes one of identifying what the representation might contain\nand where it might be stored. This is what we refer to as an “inter-\nnal representation.” Alternatively, the parameters might arise from\nthe performance of the action in response to constraints imposed\nby the environment, e.g., in the dynamic behavior of a system.\nThis is what we refer to as an “external representation.” W e argue\nthat, while there is evidence to support the view that tool use can\nbe guided by “internal representation, ” this only provides a partial\nview of such activity and that the use of “external representation”\ncan provide a viable alternative account.\nThe position taken in this paper assumes that the physical\nbehavior of the person can be viewed as part and parcel of their\ncognitive activity, and that there is a close coupling between a\nperson’s action and their perception of features of objects in the\nworld. However, neither assumption fully captures human activ-\nity when using physical objects for goal-directed activity (which\nis the broad deﬁnition of tool-use employed in this paper). Thus,\nwe argue for a broader appreciation ofGibson’s (1979) notion of\ncomplimentarity as an explanation of affordance at a “system” level.\nThe notion of “system” here draws onMaravita and Iriki’s (2004)\nidea of the “hand-tool body schema” but we extend this to cover\nperson–environment–tool–object. For us, this requires the notion\nof Distributed Cognition to encompass not simply the manner\nin which artifacts represent concepts but also how they represent\npraxis. In other words, the design of the tool (as a human-made\nartifact) reﬂects not only the manufacturing process but also a set\nof assumptions about how that tool should be grasped and manip-\nulated, and how activities involving that tool can be performed\n“correctly.” This means that “tools” are distinct from other physi-\ncal objects in the human environment because their use is deﬁned\nnot only by their appearance or the user’s goals but also by cultural\nconstraints that have inﬂuenced their production ( Baber, 2003,\n2006; Burghardt et al., 2011). While there are instances in which\nother physical objects, such as sticks or stones, can fulﬁl tool func-\ntions, and while the neurological evidence suggests that images\nwww.frontiersin.org February 2014| Volume 5| Article 1 16| 1\nBaber et al. T ool use as distributed cognition\nof these objects activate similar regions in the brain to images of\ntools, there is accumulating evidence that the pattern of brain acti-\nvation for tools is somewhat different from that of physical objects\nper se.\n“Human beings, viewed as behaving systems, are quite simple. The appar-\nent complexity of our behaviour over time is largely a reﬂection of the\nenvironment in which we ﬁnd ourselves” [Simon, 1969]\nWhile Simon was not talking explicitly about Distributed Cog-\nnition, this quotation points to the need to understand human\nbehavior in the environment in which it occurs. For us this\nimplies a need to better understand how the environment makes\nan impact on our actions and decisions, and this suggests the ben-\neﬁt of an approach which studies human action as they occur\nin natural (or as near natural as possible) conditions. This raises\nchallenges for “ecological validity” (Neisser, 1967) which takes us\nout of the laboratory (or, for that matter, the brain scanner) and\ninto the settings in which activity is performed. A primary rea-\nson for this quest is the assumption that the relations between\nhuman, environment, tool, and object are fundamental to the\nstudy of perception and action ( Gibson, 1979; Beek and Bing-\nham, 1991; Newell, 1991). A study of the activities of tool use\naway from typical environments runs the risk of ignoring the con-\nstraints that the environment places on the performance of these\nactivities. Thus, it is vital to ensure that enough of the character-\nistics of the person–environment–tool–object system are reﬂected\nin the design of studies (even if these are conducted in labora-\ntories). W e are interested in ways in which we might be able\nto capture data from the tool using actions of people in work\nenvironments, through analyzing video of their activity (and dis-\ncussing these videos with them) or through putting sensors on\nthe tools that they use. For this paper, the focus will be on the\nuse of data collected from sensors on tools. T wo areas of activ-\nity will be used in this paper: using hand-tools in jewelery and\neating with cutlery. In both areas, the concern will be to com-\npare experienced and less experienced users of the tools. The\ncomparison will be qualitative rather than quantitative, i.e., exam-\nples of the data collected during our studies will be presented\nbut more detailed analyses of these data will be found in other\npapers.\nWHAT NEEDS TO BE REPRESENTED IN TOOL USE?\nBy way of a deﬁnition of the word “tool, ” we propose that a\ntool is a physical object which lends itself to manipulation by\na human (or animal) in order to solve a problem presented by\nobjects in the physical environment. This notion of tool-use as a\nform of problem-solving not only emphasizes the goal-directed\naspect of using tools but also the need to respond to, and over-\ncome, constraints. This deﬁnition allows us to combine both the\nphysical action of manipulating the toolwith the cognitive aspects\nof goal-directed, purposeful behavior. Following a similar line of\nargument (tool use as problem solving),Osiurak et al. (2010)sug-\ngest that the coordination of the physical actions involved in using\ntools represent a problem to be solved. They view cognition and\nphysical activity in a dialectic in which a particular goal encour-\nages the perception of particular affordances in the world and\nserves to inﬂuence the bodily action to perform, which, in turn,\nmoves the person towards their goal. This strikes us as an ele-\ngant reformulation of the notion of affordance as a goal-directed,\nphysical response to the environment. The difference between this\nview and the one presented in this paper is simply (we believe)\na matter of scale: rather than considering problem solving in the\nbroad terms that Osiurak et al. (2010) offer, our focus is on the\ninterface between tool and object (or, rather, we propose that the\n“problem” that concerns tool users is how to modify the object in\nways that satisﬁes a goal, given the constraints that the tool (and\nthe tool-users’ ability to wield that tool) might impose on their\naction).\nIn order to explore further the question of representation in\ntool use, it is important to considerwhat n e e d st ob er e p r e s e n t e d\nin order to use a tool. T ool use is not only a matter of recog-\nnizing that an object is a tool but also of knowing how to hold\nand manipulate that particular tool. It is also a matter of under-\nstanding the consequences of a particular way of using a particular\ntool. Knowing that a piercing saw (used by jewelers to cut metals)\nis held vertically for cutting (with the wrist more or less locked\nand most of the motion about the elbow), and has teeth which\ncut in one direction, leads to an understanding that the cut is\nmade on the downstroke (not the upstroke), and helps deﬁne a\nset of possible actions when using this tool. From this it might\nappear that we are arguing for (at least) some representations\nof the tool and the actions associated to be internal to the per-\nson. Does this mean that these representations are stored in the\nbrain?\nINTERNAL REPRESENTATION: NEURAL ACTIVATION IN TOOL\nUSE\nThe suggestion that the use of tools depends on “internal models”\nis nicely encapsulated in a recent paper byImamizu and Kawato\n(2012). They review literature and report studies which indicate\nthe existence of both a feed-forward model, taking efference copies\nof motor commands to enable motion dynamics, and inverse mod-\nels used to manage these dynamics. During learning, changes in\ncerebellar activity indicate the acquisition and reﬁnement of such\nmodels. As we argue in this paper, the notion that brain-based\n“internal models” are causal represents a particular view of tool\nuse, and we are proposing that it is possible to explain much of\nthe activity involved in tool use through a combination of Dis-\ntributed Cognition and dynamics which might not be represented\nin the brainper se. However, before exploring this proposal further,\nwe consider some of the neuropsychological evidence relating to\ntool use. Imamizu and Kawato (2012)review neuropsychological\nstudies of tool use and suggest that,“[A]lthough the brain regions\nrelated to each type of component cannot be uniquely determined... ”\n(p. 325) there are two distinct functional regions of the brain\nrelated to tool use: one related to the physical skills involved in\ndextrous tool manipulation, and one related to the semantic and\nconceptual knowledge relating to the functions of tools (see also\nLewis, 2006; Higuchi et al., 2007, 2009). These distinct regions are\ndiscussed in more detail in the rest of this section.\nIn their now classic study,Chao and Martin (2000)used func-\ntional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to show that viewing\nand naming of tools led to activation of the left ventral premotor\ncortex, suggesting a strong relationship between the physical\nFrontiers in Psychology | Cognition February 2014| Volume 5| Article 1 16| 2\nBaber et al. T ool use as distributed cognition\nappearance of objects and the fact these objects could be acted\nupon. Grafton et al. (1997) used positron emission tomography\n(PET) scanning of participants asked to observe or (silently) name\ntools and their use. Observation of tools resulted in strong acti-\nvation of the left dorsal premotor cortex, and (silent) naming of\nthese tools resulted in additional activation of Broca’s area. How-\never, naming theuse of the tools led to activation in Broca’s area,\ntogether with activation in left dorsal premotor cortex, left ven-\ntral premotor cortex, and left supplementary motor area. This\nimplies that naming the use of a tool (even when the action is\nnot performed with it) has motor valence which is additional to\nthat obtained when looking at the tool. It also suggests that the\nphysical appearance and name of a tool activates slightly different\nareas than the use of the tool. T aken together these, and related,\nstudies imply that brain activation relates to speciﬁc properties\nof the tool-as-form and tool-as-function, and that these proper-\nties are not solely related to a tool’s physical appearance but also\nt oh o wi tm o v e so rh o wi ti su s e d(Johnson-Frey, 2004; Martin,\n2007).\nOne suggestion is that representations of tools are held in spe-\nciﬁc regions of the brain and become activated during activities in\nwhich similar objects are used. According toGallivan et al. (2013)\nthe distributed coding of different actions associated with hand\nmovement and tool use imply that these actions are represented\nseparately and then integrated in the frontoparietal cortex. AsYe e\net al. (2013) show, in an ingenious experiment, asking people to\nthink about manipulable objects when they are performing man-\nual actions which are incompatible with those objects is difﬁcult\n(but it easy to think about non-manipulable objects during the\nperformance of such actions). This suggests that the meaning of\nobjects (speciﬁcally in terms of their properties which support\nmanipulation) is recruited during action, and that incompatible\naction interferes with this. Furthermore, work by Hoeren et al.\n(2013) points to the suggestion that the recognition of action\n(performed by other people) is processed using distinct streams:\nthe dorso-dorsal stream focusing on movement determined by\nthe properties of the objects being used, and the dorso-ventral\nstream focusing on functional appropriateness and dexterity of\ntask performance.\nKNOWLEDGE OF (FAMILIAR) TOOL USE\nThe discussion so far points to the need to draw on knowledge of\nthe appropriateness of a given tool for a given task and how to wield\nthat tool to achieve the most effective result.Riddoch et al. (2006)\npresented patients (manifesting visual extinction) with images of\npairs of objects. The pairs showed objects which people are likely\nto have experienced being used together (e.g., a bottle and a glass),\nor objects which could plausibly be used together, although might\nnot have been experienced as such (e.g., a bottle and a bucket),\nor were randomly paired in order to, as far as possible, produce\npairs which had no association. The results showed that com-\nmonly paired objects were identiﬁed more quickly than plausibly\npaired objects which, in turn, were identiﬁed more quickly than\nthe randomly paired objects (although this latter ﬁnding only held\nwhen the image showed the objects being used together rather\nthan having them presented side by side). One implication of this\nwork (which could be applied to normals as well as patients) is that\nthe common and plausible pairs activate familiar routines in tool\nuse. In contrast with this observation,Vingerhoets (2008) found\nthat presentation of images of “familiar” or “unfamiliar” tools acti-\nvated the same brain regions, with “unfamiliar” tools generating\nmore activation in the left hemispheric medial posterior occipi-\ntal and inferior posterior temporal areas (in comparison to images\nof “familiar” tools) and more activation around the supramarginal\ngyrus for the familiar tools. While these results showed strong indi-\nvidual differences, they also imply that the activation in response\nto “familiar” tools can be associated with knowledge of the appro-\npriate hand position for theuse of the tool (as opposed to simply\nwhether or not the toolcould be grasped).\nA similar line of argument comes from studies in which par-\nticipants are asked to pick up handled objects (such as cups)\nwhen the handle faces either towards or away from the hand\nthat they are instructed to use (T ucker and Ellis, 2001 ). For\nexample, Bub et al. (2012) presented images of everyday objects\ntogether with images of hands in different orientations. The\nobjects all had handles which were either oriented horizontally,\ne.g., pliers, frying pan, or vertically, e.g., beer mug, hairdryer.\nParticipants were asked to name the object. Reaction (naming)\ntime was signiﬁcantly faster when both hand and wrist orien-\ntation matched the type of handle, or when neither hand and\nwrist orientation matched the handle, but much slower when\neither hand or wrist orientation was incongruent. Relating this\nto the previous discussion of neural imaging, one can assume that\nthe photographs of the hands and the objects might have acti-\nvated different regions, with a combination occurring prior to\nresponse.\nThe suggestion that there might be preparative neural activ-\nity which corresponds to different types of action ( Rizzolatti\net al., 1988) could provide evidence for the recruitment of a\nset of representations determining task performance. Certainly\nthe movement-related cortical potential (MRCP) recorded from\nelectroencephalography (EEG) begins 2–3 s before the onset\nof movement ( T oma and Hallett, 2003; Wheaton et al., 2005).\nFurthermore, onset seems to be proportional to complexity of\nmovement, with more complex movements having longer onset\ntimes. Such activity, typically in the left posterior parietal cor-\ntex, is taken to indicate the need to manage complex motor\nactivity and, as Wheaton et al. (2005) propose may include\n“... imagining executing such movements; the goal of the move-\nment; determining the natural position and setting required for\nproper performance; sequence of motor acts and comprehension of\nthe task.” (p. 535). While we have every reason to accept that\ncomplex movements involve recruitment of appropriate muscle\ngroupings and speciﬁcation of appropriate control parameters,\nwe do not see why this necessarily involves the deﬁnition of\nspeciﬁc representations of the task context. Thus, our debate is\nnot with the neurological evidence per se but with the assump-\ntions that thesemust point to internal representations which drive\nbehavior.\nWhat is interesting in the Bub et al. (2012) study is less the\nreinforcing of activation of congruent images (or, indeed, the\neffect of incongruence) than the problems caused when one of\nthe hand images did not match the other image or the object.\nBub et al. (2012)suggest that this reﬂected disruption of the plan\nwww.frontiersin.org February 2014| Volume 5| Article 1 16| 3\nBaber et al. T ool use as distributed cognition\nbeing developed in working memory (with the images activat-\ning particular judgments about using tools). However, the images\npresented in these studies serve as the (external) representations\nabout which people are asked to make judgments. As such the\nidea that they would need to create corresponding internal rep-\nresentations in order to make such judgments seems a little odd.\nThe images that are presented provided sufﬁcient information to\nmake a judgment and the need is to determine whether these\nare “true” or “possible.” On the one hand, it seems plausible to\nassume that prior experience provides the “grounding” (Mizelle\nand Wheaton, 2010) of a tool in terms of its usage, but on the\nother hand, it is equally plausible that this could be part of the per-\nson’s action repertoire (e.g., in terms ofBernstein’s (1967)idea of\ncoordinative structures) as it is activation of speciﬁc regions of the\nbrain.\nFor an action in which participants had to use different tools\nto touch a target, precuing the target had no beneﬁt on per-\nformance, but precuing the tool to use had signiﬁcant beneﬁts\n(Massen and Prinz, 2007). W e take this to suggest that the pre-\ncuing of the tool enabled the recruitment of the appropriate\n“coordinative structure, ” to useBernstein’s (1967)phrase describ-\ning combinations of muscle enervation and limb movement, to\nperform the task with a given tool. What is interesting about\nthis interpretation of their ﬁndings is that “representation” need\nnot be same for different tasks (and, we would argue, shows\nhow it can shift to outside the brain per se). Hermsdörfer et al.\n(2006) compared performance of apraxic patients with a con-\ntrol group of normals on a sawing task. Participants were asked\nto demonstrate sawing under three conditions: when they were\nshown a photograph of a saw and asked to pantomime saw-\ning; when they were shown the photograph, given a piece of\nwood (the same size as the saw’s handle) to hold and asked\nto pantomime sawing; when they were given the actual saw to\nhold. While the controls showed fairly consistent performance\nacross the three conditions, apraxic patients showed motion\nerrors (deduced from 3D motion tracking) in the ﬁrst two con-\nditions. T ypically, these errors involved substituting mediolateral\nmotion for the anteposterial motion expected. Interestingly, these\nerrors were not apparent when the apraxic patients were given\nthe actual saw to use. On the one hand, this supports a com-\nmon ﬁnding in apraxic studies (that providing people with the\nphysical object seems to enable them to perform tasks more\neffectively and reliably than when they do not have the object\nto hand). On the other hand, we believe it tells us something\nabout the need for internal representation when using tools.\nHermsdörfer et al. (2006) conclude that “... pantomiming the\nuse of a tool and actually using the tool are facilitated by largely\ndifferent neural processes which differ in demands and goals.”\n[p. 1651]. W e would argue further that these differences arise\nbecause the use of the tool involves the control of the person–\nenvironment–tool–object system and neednot depend on internal\nrepresentation.\nCONCLUSION\nJust because the tool-using behaviors have neural correlates does\nnot mean that these are the only places in which representations\nfor the behaviors exist. Clearly, the type of grasp is likely to be\ninﬂuenced by the action which one intends to perform with the\ntool. W e have a repertoire of appropriate grasps for manipula-\nble objects, and we adapt these grasps according to contextual\ndemands. The adaptation often occurs with sufﬁcient ﬂuency and\nspeed to make it unlikely that we have simply retrieved a particular\npiece of “motor schema” from memory and applied this; indeed,\nthe very notion of a “motor schema” (with its attendant implica-\ntion of stored sequences of action) has been called into question\n(Sherwood and Lee, 2003; Shea and W ulf, 2005).Thus, we argue\nthe tool user is, partly, using the tool to make changes to objects in\nthe environment, but also partly using the tool to help create fur-\nther opportunities in the environment for using the tool. In other\nwords, tool use is an interplay between seeking a deﬁned goal and\nmanaging the affordances arising from changes in the object in the\nenvironment (resulting from the ongoing use of tools). Before dis-\ncussing the collection of data and their analysis, the next section\ndescribes the particular stance taken in this paper: Distributed\nCognition.\nEXTERNAL REPRESENTATION: DISTRIBUTED COGNITION\nAND THE EXTENDED MIND\nAs the phrase implies, Distributed Cognition addresses situa-\ntions in which the processing of information occurs outside the\nbrain. For some writers, this is the proposal that the environment\nand the objects it contains can shape the way in which cogni-\ntion is performed (Zhang and Norman, 1994;Hutchins, 1995a,b;\nScaife and Rogers, 1996). While this position could be seen as\nparaphrasing the well-known observation that the representation\nof a problem space inﬂuences the strategy that problem solvers\napply ( Chase and Simon, 1973; Larkin et al., 1980; Chi et al.,\n1981), e.g., changing the layout of a puzzle can make it easier\nor harder to solve, it also points to the importance of interactiv-\nity in behavior. For example, people playing T etris or Scrabble\ncan beneﬁt (in some situations) by being allowed to manipu-\nlate and rearrange the playing pieces (Kirsh and Maglio, 1994;\nMaglio et al., 1999). This points to the need to not simply focus\non the arrangement and design of the problem representation, but\nalso on the nature of the interaction between person and objects.\nFrom this point of view, “embodiment” becomes an essential fea-\nture of acting not only on the objects but also on the cognitive\ntasks involved in problem solving. In other words, rearranging\nthe pieces is not simply performed in order to assist thinking, it\nis thinking. This is taken to mean that the relationships within\nthe human–environment–tool–object system not only supports\n(or affords) different actions but also shapes cognition (Wilson,\n2002). The reason for this is that activity within this system is\noften time-limited, in that the actions are performed at speed, in\nreal-time and offer little opportunity for planning (what Clark,\n1997, has termed “mind on the hoof ”). From this, the main\npurpose of cognition (in tool use) is to support action in as\nsituation-appropriate manner as possible. It also suggests that,\nrather than needing to construct “internal representations” of\nthe environment, it is sufﬁcient to respond to the appearance\nof the environment. From his work with robots, Brooks (1990)\npointed out that robot performance could be more efﬁcient if they\nspent less time “planning” and creating representations, and more\nFrontiers in Psychology | Cognition February 2014| Volume 5| Article 1 16| 4\nBaber et al. T ool use as distributed cognition\ntime “acting” because “the world is its own best model” [Brooks,\n1990, 12].\nCONSIDERING AFFORDANCE\nOur reading ofGibson’s (1977, 1979) concept of affordance lies in\nhis notion of “complimentarity” in which the properties of objects\nin the environment are responded to by the animal.T urvey (1992)\noffers the term “effectivity” as a way of capturing these properties of\nthe animal. So, one way of seeing affordance lies in the complimen-\ntarity between the object’s properties and the animal’s effectivity.\nOne of the problems that the idea of “effectivity” and “properties”\nraises is the suggestion that these are separate aspects which are\nbrought together during the performance of a task, which implies\nthat they are independent, autonomous features which become\ncoupled during task performance. Indeed,Gibson (1979)suggests\nthat the “affordance” exists whether or not the observer perceives\nor attends to it. If this is the case, then it makes sense to assume\nthat one aspect of the “effectivity” of the task performer would be\nthe neural representations of the actions involved in performing\nthe task (as well as morphological features and motor skills).\nThere are many situations in which the observer cannot but\nattend to the affordance, e.g., perseveration in the behavior of\nstroke patients, or response to “fake” cues by animals. Rather than\nimplying (as Gibson seems to) that the “affordance” is an invariant\nproperty of the environment, the fact that perseveration is an\nunusual state of affairs suggests that humans (and some animals)\na r ea b l et ochooseto respond to affordances (and by implication,\nto see affordances in different situations). This implies that what\nis essential to “affordance” is this combination of the property of\nthe object in the environment and the effectivity of the speciﬁc\nindividual (with speciﬁc knowledge, skills, abilities, and goals)\nin that environment. While the properties of the object in the\nenvironment may well be invariant, the actual affordance arises\nfrom the complimentarity of environment and actor. Affordance is\npartly a matter of perception-action coupling and partly a matter\nof intention (goal) – action coupling. Perhaps a better way of\nputting this is that perception-action coupling is mediated by the\nintentionality of the actor. However, as Chemero (2009) points\nout, the idea of separable components that can be coupled runs\ncounter to the notion of complimentarity; taking affordance as the\nresult of the system created by person–environment–tool–object\n(as we do in this paper) leads to the conclusion that this is a\nsystem which is non-decomposable and which exists only during\nthe performance of the given task. From this, we suggest that the\ngoal, in the person–environment–tool–object system ispartly held\nby the person (in terms of the effect that they intend to produce\non the object) and partly situated (Suchman, 1987) in the ongoing\ninteractivity in the system. This assumption echoes the earlier\nassertion of van Leeuwen et al. (1994) that tool use can be “...\ndeﬁned as performing an action on a target by performing an action\non a tool. The action on the tool is embedded in the action on the\ntarget.” [van Leeuwen et al. (1994), p. 188–189]. Forvan Leeuwen\net al. (1994) this embedding reﬂected a “higher-order affordance\nstructure” of “mutually constraining complimentarities.”\nvan Leeuwen et al. (1994) argued that it was important to\nunderstand the role of context in task performance in terms of a\nsufﬁciency principle, i.e.,“if an affordance has already been realized,\nthere is no need to take it into account.”[van Leeuwen et al. (1994),\np. 190]. T o take this a little further,T urvey (1992)suggests that\naffordance might play a role in “predictive control” of activity and,\nwhile the analysis (and indeed use of the term), in this paper\nmight differ from his, the idea that affordance refers not only to\nimmediate action but to future actions is central to the ideas in\nthis paper. Additionally, Mizelle et al. (2013) discuss the notion\nof functional affordance, in which there is an optimal manner in\nwhich a given object can be used to achieve a desired goal. For\nexample, Mizelle et al. (2013)note that a hammer can be held a\nvariety of grasps (some involving the handle, some involving the\nhead, for instance) but that there is a grasp which“... best affords\nthe action of driving a nail... ” (p. 280). This can be seen as taking\nthe predictive control further, in that there is a goal state against\naction can be optimized. While these notions of affordancecould\nbe represented internally (in terms of speciﬁc neural correlates of\nfunctional affordance that can be adapted to contextual demands),\nthe notion of complimentarity followed in this paper offers a more\nparsimonious explanation. In other words, the Gibsonian notion\nof affordance is taken in this paper to describe a particular form of\ncomplimentarity in the person–environment–tool–object system,\nand it is the “system” as a whole which can be said to optimize the\ntool-using activity.\nTASKONOMY AND HOW THE ENVIRONMENT AFFORDS SKILLED\nACTION\nOne way in which the environment can be created to provide\naffordances for future action is in the ways in which experts lay\nout their workspace. In their discussion of blacksmiths,Keller and\nKeller (1996) use the term “taskonomy” to refer to the ways in\nwhich an expert’s knowledge of the tasks to be performed help\ncreate the arrangement (taxonomy) of tools in their space. This\narrangement is not simply a matter of having particular types of\ntools kept near each other, but arises through a combination of\ntools and actions. A similar pattern can be seen in the workspace\nof the jeweler (Figure 1).\nAs the jeweler performs a particular task, so a tool is picked\nup, used and then laid down in the workspace; as work progresses\nso tools are either reused or new ones introduced. However, the\nexpert is often able to describe what work had been completed\nin a particular workspace by looking at the collection of tools in\nthe immediate vicinity. In some cases, specialized tools will be\nbrought to the workspace with the intention of supporting a par-\nticular goal. Thus, the workspace becomes managed to provide\nparticular affordances (in terms of available tools and the posi-\ntion in which these tools are placed to support particular types\nof grasp). This suggests the anticipation of tasks and the arrange-\nment of the workspace in line with these anticipations. In these\nways, the movement of tools in the workspace (as the result of\ndeliberately selecting these in preparation of a speciﬁc job, or as\nthe result of picking up and putting down the tools during the\nperformance of the job, or as the result of moving tools which are\nno longer needed further away from the central point of reaching)\nbecomes part of the structuring of the workspace. Rather than\nsimply reﬂecting the ebb and ﬂow of actions in the workspace, we\nargue that this reﬂects the management of potential affordances\nand, as such, is a form of Distributed Cognition. The suggestion\nwww.frontiersin.org February 2014| Volume 5| Article 1 16| 5\nBaber et al. T ool use as distributed cognition\nFIGURE 1 | “T askonomy” in jewelers’ workspaces.\nthat moving tools around the workspace is a form of “cognition” is\nlogically the same as the suggestion that presentation of a problem\nwill “frame” the approach to the solution and that manipulating\npieces in a puzzle might be a form of thinking. In other words,\nlayout of the workspace will frame the actions which are most\nlikely to be performed and this framing is the result of deliber-\nate choices made to retain, discard or move a tool after it has\nbeen used (rather than merely a consequence of moving tools\naround).\nWORKING WITH TOOLS\nIn his discussion of craftwork, David Pye draws the useful dis-\ntinction between “certainty” and “risk” in craftwork. He argues\nthat in “the workmanship of certainty” there is an impetus to\ndesign work to ensure consistency, repeatability, and minimize\nvariation or ambiguity. Such work involves heavily proscribed\nprocedures and measures of quality and could be interpreted in\nterms of industrialized production processes. In this approach,\nthe artifact being produced will be tightly speciﬁed prior to pro-\nduction and the resulting artifact will be considered in terms of\nthis speciﬁcation. Anyone who has constructed ﬂat-pack or self-\nassembly furniture will have encountered a situation in which the\nmanufacturer has sought to encourage workmanship of certainty.\nHowever, anyone who has built self-assembly furniture will also\nrecognize the challenges that this poses. Misreading the instruc-\ntions or believing that you know what you are doing so don’t\nneed to read the instructions can lead to results which differ\nfrom the goal. This could be quite minor (a handful of left over\ncomponents) or quite major (the door which doesn’t open, the\nshelf which drops out when the unit is stood up). This varia-\ntion illustrates the workmanship of risk. This, in turn, reﬂects\nthe variability in outcome which can arise from decisions made\nby the worker during the performance of the tasks. The deci-\nsions could reﬂect a choice of tool, or knowledge/skill in the\nuse of the tool, but they could equally reﬂect responses to the\nopportunities presented (or constraints created) by the materials\nbeing used. For example, the knot in a piece of wood, or the ﬁn-\nish on one side of the self-assembly wardrobe, could constraint\nthe actions which are possible or could suggest an appropriate\naction to perform. In contrast, the “workmanship of risk” does\nnot involve such tight speciﬁcation, i.e., “... the quality of the\nresult is not predetermined, but depends on the judgment, dexter-\nity and care which the maker exercises as he works.” (Pye, 1968,\np. 20). Rather than the intent or purpose being predetermined, it\nis now something which crystalizes through the developing inter-\naction between craftworker, tools, and materials being worked.\nThis is something which we noted in our study of jewellery mak-\ning (Baber and Saini, 1995): the jeweler worked to very sketchy\n“plans” but adapted these plans to suit the resulting state of the\nmaterial, often modifying a particular ring or brooch to capital-\nize on a particular facet that they noticed as the metal was being\nworked.\n“First, the experienced worker usually employs “smoother ” and more\nconsistent movements…Secondly, the experienced worker operates more\nrhythmically, indicating that a higher degree of temporal organization\nhas been achieved. Thirdly, the experienced worker makes better use of the\nsensory data... Fourthly, the experienced worker reacts in an integrated\nway to groups of sensory signals, and makes organized grouped responses\nto them” [Seymour, 1972, 35–36]\nThe quotation fromSeymour (1972) indicates how the output\nof the human–environment–tool–object system is being opti-\nmized, but not necessarily how the dynamics of the system relate\nchanges in input to output. In order to consider this, we turn\nour attention to series of studies conducted by Bril and her col-\nleagues, focusing on tasks involving hammering (either stone\nhammers to knap ﬂint or metal hammers to shape stone or glass\nbeads).\nSYSTEM DYNAMICS: TRANSFORMATIONS IN TOOL USE\nOur actions, when using tools, involve the coordination of a set\nof transformations ( Biryukova and Bril, 2012). W e transform\nkinetic energy into tool motion – but need to appreciate how\nmuch energy to exert in order to produce the desired motion\nof the tool (and in order to produce the desired effect on the\nobject from the tool’s motion). W e manage dynamic transforma-\ntions, balancing the movement of the tool in the air and on the\nobject with our own motions and with the outcome of the tool’s\nactivity. W e anticipate what effect the tool’s motions will pro-\nduce and relate these to the outcomes that we desire. As Ingold\nFrontiers in Psychology | Cognition February 2014| Volume 5| Article 1 16| 6\nBaber et al. T ool use as distributed cognition\n(2000) points out, “Intentionality and functionality are... imma-\nnent in the activity itself, in the gestural synergy of human being,\ntool and environment.”(Ingold, 2000, p. 352.) The ability to both\nanticipate the outcome of the tool’s action and manage the func-\ntionality of the tool are an integral part of the use of the tool. The\ndynamics of using the tool thus becomes far more important than\nmight be implied by the neurological imaging work which concen-\ntrates on the form and function of the tool. Given that these (and\nrelated) transformations need to be managed during the use of\ntools, it is worth askingwhere these transformations might be rep-\nresented? If they are “represented” simply during the performance\nof an action, and arise from the moment-to-moment correction of\nthe action, then one might not expect to see anticipatory effects.\nOn the other hand, if there is evidence of anticipation (of the\nconsequences of any of these transformations) then this implies\na need to represent the consequence and the question remains,\nwhere does this representation reside and what form does it\ntake?\nBefore considering the questions of transformations, it is worth\nrepeating some of the observations from these studies regarding\nexpertise. For example, Roux et al. (1995) showed that expert\ncraftsmen (making stone or glass beads) showed signiﬁcantly\nless inter- and intra-individual variations in performance than\nless experienced workers. Similarly, Biryukova and Bril (2008)\nshowed that expert knappers used a larger repertoire of joint angle\ncombinations than their less qualiﬁed colleagues (who tended to\ndemonstrate more rigid behavior), and Bril et al. (2010)showed\nthat experts showed a lower variability in kinetic energy com-\npared to intermediates and novices. In related work, Ve r n o o i j\net al. (2012) explored learning in a task involving the use of a\n300-g hammer-stone. Analysis of motion tracked during the per-\nformance of this task showed inter-individual differences in the\nways in which joint angles were combined to strike a particu-\nlar type of blow and that these combinations changed during\nthe course of the study. The analysis of learning to use such\na hammer suggested that participants were only able to modify\none parameter (relating to joint angles or impact force) but not\nboth at the same time, until they had gained proﬁciency in the\ntask.\nIn a series of experiments comparing expert, intermediate and\nnovice users of stone hammers (in ﬂint-knapping tasks conducted\nin the laboratory),Bril et al. (2010)identify three primary param-\neters that seem to contribute to the dynamics of tool use in this\ncontext. The ﬁrst are Control Parameters, such as the velocity\nwith which the hammer stone approached the target. The study\nshowed that, in general, novices appreciated the need to control\nvelocity but were not able to control this efﬁciently (this ﬁnding is\nsupported by the work onV ernooij et al., 2012, discussed above).\nThus, we would expect greater variability in the novice perfor-\nmance on these control parameters; asSeymour (1972) put it, the\nexpert actions would be performed in a “smoother, ” “more consis-\ntent, ”“more rhythmical[ly]” manner. The second set of parameters\nconsidered by Bril et al. (2010)are regulatory parameters, such as\nthe trajectory followed by the hammer stone and the potential\nenergy applied. Experts tended to show shorter trajectories and\nsmaller ratios between parameters. In Seymour’s (1972) terms,\nthis shows how experts are able to use a “higher degree of temporal\norganization” and also to make “better use of the sensory data” in\nmanaging their actions. As Bril et al. (2010)note, “In the present\ntask, the velocity of the hammer had to be controlled to produce the\nrequired kinetic energy in relation to the mass of the hammer. This\nwas achieved by concurrently changing the trajectory, the amplitude\nof the movement, and the muscular force. In this perspective, the\nmovement became meaningful only in relation to the production of\nfunctional parameters at the level of the task, which allowed for move-\nment ﬂexibility as long as the task requirements were fulﬁlled.”(Bril\net al., 2010, p. 837). This quotation introduces the third parame-\nter, the Functional parameter, such as kinetic energy, which experts\nappear to hold constant and aim to apply the lowest kinetic energy\nthat is sufﬁcient for the task. As the experiments involved present-\ning participants with hammers of different weights and requiring\nthem to produce ﬂakes of different sizes, one can assume that all\nparticipants would be able to discern changes in hammer weight or\ntask demands (in terms of ﬂake size), but the results suggest that a\ncharacteristic of expertise (which was not available to the novices)\nwas the ability to respond to “nested relationships” (W agman and\nCarello, 2003) between weight of hammer and size of ﬂake to pro-\nduce. The ability to appreciate these “nested relationships” allowed\nthe experts to interpret the constraints placed on them by the\nperson–environment–tool–object relationships and respond to\nthese in ways that the novices could not. So, we return to the ques-\ntion of where these constraints might be represented? One possi-\nbility (implied bySeymour, 1972 and mooted byBril et al., 2010)\nis that the initial representations involve Functional parameters\nwhich are learned and then adapted to changes in context.\nIn his discussion of dexterity,Bernstein (1967)highlighted that\nthe main determinant was not bodily movement so much as the\ncapability to respond to changes in the conditions surrounding\nthe person. Bernstein’s (1967) notions of tool use, in terms of\ndexterity, relate to the quotation fromSimon (1969) at the start\nof this paper. The manipulation of tools is rarely an end in itself\nbut is performed with the intention of shaping objects in the envi-\nronment. The actions performed lead to changes in the objects\nbut also indicate the intentionality of the tool user (providing they\nhave sufﬁciently dexterity in their use of the tools). The expert tool\nuser thinks through the tools that are used because the actions per-\nformed with the tools shape the environment in such a way as to\nsolve the problems that it presents and in such a way as to produce\nthe results that the tool user desires. The action performed with\nthe tool also creates the opportunities for the next action; and this,\nin turn, reﬂects the type of grip and posture which the tool user\nadopts. In this way, grip and posture (in holding and using a tool)\nindicate the chosen solution to the problem that the tool user is\nsolving.\nIn much the same way that Rosenbaum et al. (2012) speaks\nof end-state comfort (and the ways in which a posture antici-\npates a particular end-state following the movement), so we can\nthink of the ways in which the tool user is continually seek-\ning to adapt their current motions in anticipation of subsequent\nmotions and states of the object. For this paper, we take this to\nmean that the skilled tool-user is better able to coordinate the\nperson–environment–tool–object system and to anticipate how\nchanges in this system require adaptation of activity. This real-\ntime adaptation need not imply internal representation of either\nwww.frontiersin.org February 2014| Volume 5| Article 1 16| 7\nBaber et al.

In a sense, expertise is the practiced adaptation of intrinsic\ndynamics to task dynamics (where task dynamics are deﬁned by\nthe person–environment–tool–object system) so that changes in\ntask constraints and affordances can be appropriately responded to\nthrough subtle tuning of actions. This implies that experts are able\nto modify the pattern of activity without necessarily impairing the\nfunctional impact of the activity. W e do not believe that experts\nneed to possess, or even represent, these various patterns of activ-\nity but rather these arise on-the-ﬂy during the coordinated control\nof limbs holding and controlling tools.\nSTUDIES USING SENSORS FITTED TO THE HANDLES OF\nTOOLS\nIn order to explore these questions of dynamics, we have been\nexploring ways in which to capture behavior in the ﬁeld (or, at\nFrontiers in Psychology | Cognition February 2014| Volume 5| Article 1 16| 8\nBaber et al. T ool use as distributed cognition\nFIGURE 4 | Spectrograms from three participants performing one of\nthe “paint removal” tasks. The spectrogram of frequencies 0–20 Hz over\ntime for y -movement (i.e., back and forth motion of the ﬁle across the\nwood), moving between the 1st and 3rd dots on the ﬁle with the goal of\nremoving two layers of paint.\nleast, in laboratory and workshop settings which are as close to\nthe ﬁeld as possible). This has involved designing and developing\nhandles which combine different types of sensor to capture the\nactions a person performs. Often such data are collected from\nusing camera systems with markers on the person. While these\ncan be very accurate, they are not easy to use in the ﬁeld. Thus,\nit makes more sense to instrument the person or their tools in\norder to collect datain situ. W e have taken the lead from Bril and\nher colleagues (discussed in the previous section) to instrument\nour tools (Figure 2). In our work, strain gages are used to capture\nforce applied to the handle and a three-axis accelerometer is used\nto capture motion (Parekh and Baber, 2010 for a description of\nthe design of these handles).\nIn order to appreciate how experience in using a given tool can\nshape activity, Figure 3 presents an extract of recordings (from\na three-axis accelerometer and strain gages integrated into the\nhandle of a jeweler’s ﬁle) of an experienced silversmith ﬁling the\nedge of a metal strip. Figure 3 shows three ﬁling strokes over\nthe course of 2.5 s. Each stroke (occurring at approximately 11.6,\n12, and 12.9 s) is indicated by an increase in they-velocity data.\nThere are two types of stroke here: rapid (at 11.6 and 12.9 s) in\nwhich the ﬁle in moved rapidly across the metal, and slow (12 s)\nin which the ﬁle is drawn more slowly over the metal. During\neach stroke, there is downward pressure on the ﬁle (indicated by\nthe decrease in z-velocity data and increase in “top grip” force\napplied to the top of the handle). Immediately following the\nstroke, the ﬁle is lifted up (increase in z-velocity) and brought\nback to the starting point. Prior to the next stroke the ﬁle is\nadjusted and aligned with the metal (which takes around 1 s),\nwhich involves little change in grip force applied and z-velocity.\nThe top grip loosens as the ﬁle position is reset for lifting the\nﬁle off the object (movement in the z direction); the expert\nuser only applies force on the forwards motion. This action is\npartly dictated by the ﬁle being used and partly by the results\nthat the tool user intends. As the expert said, you can remove\nmetal easily enough but you can’t put it back. So ﬁling is about\nremoving sufﬁcient (but not too much) of the metal. Further-\nmore, the metal being worked (copper in this instance) could\neasily be dulled if too much of the upper surface was removed,\nand so ﬁling was also a matter of retaining the luster of the metal.\nSuch knowledge can affect the way in which the tool is wielded\nand inﬂuence the outcomes that one might expect when using the\ntools.\nIn another study, we asked novice users of a ﬁle to remove paint\nfrom a piece of wood.Figure 2B shows the task being performed.\nThere are three dots painted on the top of the ﬁle and participant\nwas instructed to ensure that the ﬁle was kept between the ﬁrst and\nsecond, or the ﬁrst and third dots.\nContrasting three people performing the ﬁling task (Figure 4),\nwe can see that while the main activi ty (yellow on the spectro-\ngraphs) occurs at similar frequencies, the harmonics vary. These\nvariations might reﬂect differences in strategy. W e would expect\nto see harmonics from these data due to the periodicity of the\nrepetitive motions employed. This also suggests that differences\nin performance can be captured through a better appreciation\nof dynamics and, potentially, following the lead of Bernstein\n(1967), can be reﬂected in the conservation of energy of the tool\nusers.\nThe raw accelerometer data were integrated to produce veloc-\nity, on which we applied a Fourier transform to determine the\nfundamental frequency of the ﬁling motion.Ta b l e 1suggests that\nthe main determinant of this fundamental frequency is not the\ntool-speciﬁc goal to keep the two dots inside the wood, but the\ntask-speciﬁc goal to remove one or two layers of paint.\nCULTURAL AFFORDANCES\nIn this section, we turn our attention to the broader question of\ncultural effects in tool use. For the sake of the discussion, we restrict\nourselves to the simple assumption that cultural constraints can\nwww.frontiersin.org February 2014| Volume 5| Article 1 16| 9\nBaber et al.

Thus, one\nquestion that can be used to address the issue of “culture” in tool\nuse is to ask how should oneproperly use cutlery, such as a spoon,\nknife or fork?\nIn their study of eating (kale or water) with a spoon,van der\nKamp and Steenbergen (1999)used video-based motion tracking\nto record arm motion. The likelihood of spilling the contents of\nthe spoon (kale or water) when it was moved from bowl to mouth\nincreased the number of corrective sub-movements made during\nthe action which affected the kinematic proﬁle of the movement.\nThe contents of the spoon also affected head motion. Participants\nwere more likely to move their head towards the spoon when it\ncontained water which, in turn, shows how the coordination of the\nmotion system (i.e., contents–spoon–hand–arm–head) changes in\nresponse to task demands. Interestingly, the study also hinted at\nvariation in “eating styles” which reﬂected individual differences in\nperformance. W e are interested in how these “eating styles” might\nalso reﬂect cultural responses to cutlery and how culture deﬁnes\nthe “proper” way to use an item of cutlery. Of course, the use of the\nword “properly” is deliberately provocative and culturally loaded.\nAt one level, “proper” use could simply mean that food is moved\nfrom plate to mouth in a controlled manner, in sufﬁcient quantities\nto make it easy to eat. At another level, “proper” use could relate\nto various social mores and rules of etiquette in terms of how the\nknife and fork are held and moved, and how much food is held on\nthe fork or put into the mouth. For example, in her discussion of\nusing forks, Visser (1991) contrasts the “English” style (of eating\nfrom the back of the fork tines and holding the knife in the other\nhand) with the “ American” style (of eating from the bowl of the\nfork and swapping, or “zig-zagging” fork and knife).\nW e asked participants, using a knife and a fork (ﬁtted to our\ninstrumented handles), to perform a somewhat unusual version\nof “eating.” The task goal required participants to lift a forkful of\nsweet-corn to their chin. This breaks down into: “load fork’ , “lift\nfork’ , and “terminate” (e.g., most participants simply tipped the\nfork to drop the sweet-corn back onto the plate). The “English”\nor “ American” styles outlined above are illustrated byFigure 5.\nIn order to consider variation, we selected one participant who\nwas familiar with the “English” style (Figure 6) and one of the\nparticipants who had never used cutlery in this manner (Figure 7).\nFigures 6and 7 show that variability in the data from the inex-\nperienced user are consistently higher than the experienced user\nfor both grip and accelerometer data. This echoes the earlier ﬁnd-\nings relating the variability in “skilled” performance. Rather than\nthe “skill’ , in this case, being the result of instruction, training\nand practice (as one might expect in the use of hand-tools), these\nresults hint that enculturation and exposure to particular beliefs\nabout appropriate use of cutlery can have an impact on the ease\nwith which these artifacts are manipulated in different ways.\nDISCUSSION\nW e use tools to solve the problems that objects in the environ-\nment present to us. This is an obvious statement but hides a\ncouple of points which are worth noting. The ﬁrst is that inten-\ntion which underlies the use of the tool combines a task goal with\nthe affordances of the tool–object interface, and the constraints\nof the person–environment–tool–object system. This means that\n“cognition” becomes the active response to the affordances of the\ninteraction between tool and object in terms of the task goal that\nthe user is seeking to achieve. T aking Gibson’s notion of com-\nplimentarity, we can say that the dynamic aspect of this activity\ncontinually shapes the actions of the person as much as it shapes\nthe state of the object. In other words, the states of the object, envi-\nronment, tool, and person become combined to form the focus of\naction and, by implication, to help frame and reframe the task\ngoal. One might expect the task goal to be kept constant during\nthe performance of the task. However, our discussions with, and\nobservations of, expert jewelers suggests that this not entirely the\ncase. While the high-level objective might remain the same (e.g.,\nproduce a ring of a particular size set with a particular stone), the\ndevelopment of the “plan” to achieve this goal adapts to the state\nof the metal and the performance of the task. Thus, the task goal\nwould appear to follow the notion of “situated action” (Suchman,\n1987) which changes with context. This raises the second point,\nthat, the focus of action is context-dependent and the context\nis continually changing. So, tool use is enactive, embedded and\nembodied.\nThe comparisons of experienced and inexperienced users of\ntools (and cutlery) considered in this paper show that expertise\nnot only involves less variability in physical performance but also\nbetter control of energy expended in the performance of a given\ntask with a given tool. W e believe that this points to the well-known\nassertion that the expert develops a “feel” for the tool, and often\nprefer to use their own tools for particular tasks because these have\nbecome very familiar to them. Indeed, a potential problem that\nwe face with the instrumented handles that we use is that these\nfeel different from those that the experienced tool users prefer.\nAnecdotally, only the experienced tool users commented on the\nfeel (weight, balance, material) of these handles during the data\ncollection.\nThe skilled craft-worker will often speak of the tool becoming\npart of the body, and the feeling of manipulating the tool being\nakin to simply moving the hand in which the tool held. For some\nwriters, this implies that the tool can be considered as a physical\nFrontiers in Psychology | Cognition February 2014| Volume 5| Article 1 16| 10\nBaber et al.

The pattern of\ngrip force applied (particularly to the fork handle) and the\nsmoothness of the fork’s accelerometer trace show how the\nexperienced participant’s repetitions are consistent and reﬂect a\nwell-practiced motion.www.frontiersin.org February 2014| Volume 5| Article 1 16| 11\nBaber et al. T ool use as distributed cognition\nFIGURE 7 | Variable “English” use (over six separate attempts). The\ninexperienced participant shows large variation in grip force and\naccelerometer trace for the fork. During the task, his preferred approach was\nto tilt the fork on its side and move it towards the kernels, using the knife as a\nstop. He then held the fork at an angle and used the knife to keep the kernals\npressed to the tines as he lifted both knife and fork. There is less correlation\nshown between grip and activity from the knife, which is being pushed on to\nthe top of the fork, and, particularly towards the right of the graphs, the fork is\nheld with force primarily only on two sides of the handle as opposed to a full\ngrip.\nextension of the person and that, therefore, motor control becomes\na matter of adapting to the added potential of the “extended-limb.”\nHowever, rather than simply being a matter of planning movement\nwith the addition of the tool, it is plausible to suggest that the\ntool changes the perception of space around the tool user (Mar-\navita et al., 2002). “People who use tools... build an increasingly rich\nimplicit understanding of the world in which they use the tools...”\n[Cutler, 1994, p. 80]. In her discussion of representations in tool-\nuse, Massen (2013) emphasizes the need to appreciate how tools\nbecome part of the peripersonal space of the user, suchthat “there\nis no need to distinguish between external goal locations to which the\ntool has to be moved and the locations to which the bodily effector\nhas to be moved.”(p. 2). While this makes sense when considering\nmovements with tools, it overlooks an equally important aspect\nof the skilled craft-worker. The reason that the tool feels as if it is\npart of the person is because it “disappears” from attention which\nbecomes more and more focused on the object being worked on.\nThis suggests that, rather than the tool being an extension of the\nbody, it makes more sense that the tool creates a focus of atten-\ntion – with the sense that the tool’s movement becomes so central\nto attention that the control of the limb operating it becomes\nless important. This suggests that, rather than considering the\ntool-hand combination, it is more important to consider the tool-\nobject combination because this is where the skilled practitioner is\nattending.\nThe use of tools, by experts, seems to involve anticipatory, feed-\nforward control of movement (as well as rapid and efﬁcient use of\nfeed-back through all of their senses) in which subtle adjustments\nin the manipulation of the tool are performed in order to effect\ndesired changes in the object being worked on. Not only does\nthis explain the minimal variability but also highlights the central\nquestion of this paper; if so much of the activity of the expert tool\nuser is anticipatory, how are these anticipations represented? W e\npropose that it is not sufﬁcient to only look in the brain of the\nexpert tool user to discover these representations. Even if there are\nregions which are active under speciﬁc conditions, the skill of the\nexpert tool user comes from the ability to control their activity\nwith sufﬁcient spare capacity to cope with future demands and to\nrespond to the changing context in which they are using the tools\nto effect changes in the object being worked on. The idea that the\nenvironment (and the objects it contains) can be interpreted in\ndifferent ways, suggests that these become “external representa-\ntions” to which the person responds. Response is partly a matter\nof knowledge, skill and ability of the person, partly a matter of\nﬁt between action and environment and partly a matter of the\nnature of the environment and the objects it contains. As the per-\nson focuses on speciﬁc aspects, which are relevant to the task (of\nshaping a piece of metal or arranging tools in a workspace) so these\naspects become the cognitive space in which subsequent decisions\nare made. T ool use, as a form of problem solving, becomes a\nmatter of making these decisions as the cognitive space changes;\nand a means of acting upon the cognitive space to create new\nopportunities. This further suggests that much of the activity\nwhich is assumed to be “feed-forward” (in the sense that there\nneeds to be a model which guides behavior) could be explained by\nfast-acting, negative feedback loops (integrated across several sen-\nsory modalities) which support moment-by-moment correction\nthrough solving the inverse kinematics problems of positioning a\ngiven tool in a given position in order to effect change in the object\nbeing worked on.\nW e believe that much of the “representation” drawn upon in\nthe use of tools can be in the form of external representations (the\nFrontiers in Psychology | Cognition February 2014| Volume 5| Article 1 16| 12\nBaber et al. T ool use as distributed cognition\nobjects and tools in a given environment, particularly in support\nof the situated action of ongoing planning in tool use) and in the\nform of coordinative structures (the control and management of\nphysical activity, particularly in terms of feed-forward control of\nmovement and use of feed-back from the results of the move-\nment). In other words, following the lead of Riccio (1993) and\nthe more detailed arguments ofChemero (2009) an internal rep-\nresentation is not necessary for the control, coordination and (we\npropose) planning of tool use because it is sufﬁcient for the tool\nuser to have the ability to perceive the state of the object on which\nshe works and to manipulate the tool in order to produce a partic-\nular pattern of perceptions (and, in this case, we suggest that these\npatterns are equally as likely to be olfactory, haptic, and auditory\nas visual). This ability becomes manifest only during the per-\nformance of a person–environment–tool–object system (echoing\nButler’s claim that “strictly speaking, nothing is a tool except dur-\ning use”) and this system can be described using System Dynamics,\nin which the systems goal is the optimization of speciﬁc movement\nparameters in order to produce an effect on a given object. This\nreduces the need for there to be internal representationsper se(see\nalso Barrett, 2011). Furthermore, any “representation” that the tool\nuser employs is likely to spread across the entire nervous system\nrather than solely in regions of the brain. From this, the strong\nand compelling evidence accumulated from the activation of spe-\nciﬁc regions in the brain is taken to indicate the result rather than\nthe cause of tool using behavior (whether observed, imagined,\nor performed) which arises from the recruitment and activation\nof coordinative structures (Bernstein, 1967) through task-speciﬁc\ndevices ( Beek and Bingham, 1991 ). While our paper has not\nsought to present evidence in support of this claim, we believe\nthat this statement helps to bring together the ongoing work that\nwe have reviewed and raises the opportunity to develop testable\nhypotheses for future exploration of the ways in which people\nuse tools.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nAn early draft of this paper was much improved through com-\nments from Anthony Chemero and two anonymous reviewers.\nREFERENCES\nBaber, C.
