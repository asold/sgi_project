INTRODUCTION\nAt present, numerous radio frequency integrated cir-\ncuit (RFIC) designs are being implemented with transformers\nfor various purposes such as impedance matching, impedance\ntransformation, and signal conversion between single-ended\nand differential signals in various frequency bands ranging\nfrom the radio frequency (RF) to terahertz regimes. Trans-\nformers are used in many applications, including power\nampliﬁers, low-noise ampliﬁers, voltage-controlled oscilla-\ntors, mixers, and power-combining circuits [1]–[9]. There-\nfore, many studies have been published on modeling and\nanalyzing transformers, new transformer structures, and new\nmethods for enhancing transformer efﬁciency [10]–[15].\nHowever, most of these studies are not only complex but\nalso application-speciﬁc, making it difﬁcult to directly apply\nthe proposed techniques to the practical design of a highly\nefﬁcient transformer.\nIn particular, when we use a transformer for a speciﬁc pur-\npose such as impedance transformation or signal balancing,\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Bora Onat.\nthe transformer should be optimally designed to provide max-\nimum power transfer from the source to the load. It is well\nknown that the input and output ports of a transformer should\nbe simultaneously conjugate matched to the source and load\nimpedances [16]. The general solution of the load and the\nsource to the simultaneous conjugate match for a two-port\nnetwork using Z-parameters was presented originally in [17],\nor recently in [18]. However, little analytical details can be\nseen for speciﬁc structures used in RF circuit design such\nas the impedance matching network consisting of a lossy\ntransformer and a shunt tuning capacitor for calculating the\noptimum source and load impedances. Relevant work on syn-\nthesizing lossless impedance matching networks was given\nin [19] which gave the detailed analysis and synthesis of the\nlossless matching network based on the transmission phase\nshift from a given source to a load. Nevertheless, the work\ndid not cover the impedance matching network using a lossy\ntransformer.\nConsiderable effort has been devoted to optimizing the\nefﬁciency of transformers. In [20], the authors presented\nformulae for a series load (a resistor in series with a capacitor)\n140980 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

However, they can-\nnot be extended to a transformer-based matching network\nwith a resistive load in parallel with a capacitor, which is\nwidely used in RFICs [21]–[24]. In the wireless power trans-\nfer (WPT) ﬁeld, an inductive power link involves a load with a\nparallel tuning capacitor; the load resonates with the inductive\npart of the transformer [25]. Although optimum load equa-\ntions have been proposed, the assumptions made for deriv-\ning them render them impractical for a typical transformer.\nIn addition, these studies have not considered impedance\nmatching at the source, which is as important as impedance\nmatching at the load for power transfer from the source to the\nload. Based on the work in [17], a comprehensive solution\nof the load and the source for inductively coupled coils for\nthe wireless power transfer application was presented in [26].\nHowever, it did not cover the transformer-based impedance\nmatching network with a shunt tuning capacitor which has\nbeen widely used in RFIC design.\nIn this study, we developed a systematic approach to the\ndesign and analysis of a transformer-based impedance match-\ning network. We derived general conditions for the source\nand load from the characteristic parameters of the transformer\nfor optimal power transfer. For a simpliﬁed transformer\nmodel involving two magnetically coupled coils, analytical\nequations were derived for simultaneous conjugate match-\ning, and the transformer parameters were extracted from\nZ-parameters. On the basis of an analysis of the maximum\npower transfer condition, the product of the coupling coef-\nﬁcient k and the quality factors of the primary ( Q1) and\nsecondary ( Q2) windings k2Q1Q2 was used as a ﬁgure of\nmerit to evaluate the quality of the transformer.\nThis paper consists of ﬁve sections. We present a detailed\nanalysis of the impedance matching of the on-chip trans-\nformer based on two magnetically coupled coils in Section II.\nTo demonstrate the validity and applicability of the derived\nequations for various transformer parameters, a typical\n2:1 on-chip transformer designed in a 0.18 µm CMOS pro-\ncess was evaluated with the High Frequency Structure Simu-\nlator (HFSS). A comparison of the calculated values with the\nsimulation results is presented in Section III to demonstrate\nthe validity of the presented analysis. Next, in Section IV ,\nwe present a design for impedance matching with a trans-\nformer containing a parallel tuning capacitor at the load\nand source, along with an analysis of the impedance match-\ning. In Section V , the fabrication of the on-chip transformer\n(mentioned in Section III) in a 0.18 µm CMOS process is\ndiscussed, and our works are compared with measurement\nresults to verify the applicability of the proposed work on the\non-chip transformer to RFIC design in the gigahertz regime.\nFinally, conclusions are provided in Section VI.\nII. IMPEDANCE MATCHING FOR A GENERAL LOAD\nA. LOW-FREQUENCY TRANSFORMER MODEL WITH TWO\nMAGNETICALLY COUPLED COILS\nIn a passive transformer, an input signal or input power from\nthe source is transferred to the load by the magnetic coupling\nbetween two or more conductors, which are called windings.\nNotably, when we implement a winding transformer on a\nsilicon substrate, the series resistance of each winding is\nquite signiﬁcant because of the fabrication of the windings\non relatively thin metal layers within back-end-of-the-line\n(BEOL) dielectric layers, and the skin effect in the metal\nwindings in modern silicon technologies.\nSeveral secondary effects, such as capacitive coupling and\nmagnetic coupling to the substrate, lower the quality factor\nQ of each coil. For the accurate modeling of the on-chip\ntransformer, an enormously large number of lumped-element\nparameters should be considered [27]. Therefore, this type\nof sophisticated modeling might not be quite appealing in\nthe early stages of design optimization. Instead, we extracted\nthe effective transformer parameters for the two magnetically\ncoupled coils from Z-parameters, and the extracted param-\neters were then used in the derived analytical formulae to\ndesign a simultaneous conjugate matching network, which\ndemonstrated a promising accuracy of the maximum power\ntransfer by the frequency response up to 72 % of the self-\nresonant frequency (SRF) of the transformer within a percent-\nage error of 10 %.\nTypically, a transformer can be considered as two magnet-\nically coupled coils, as shown in Fig. 1. In this simpliﬁed\nmodel, the transformer is characterized by only ﬁve param-\neters: the series resistances ( R1 and R2), the inductances\n(L1 and L2) of the primary and secondary windings, and\nthe coupling coefﬁcient, which indicates the strength of the\nmagnetic coupling between the two windings [27]. The turn\nratio between the two windings is deﬁned as n =L1/L2. It\nis noteworthy that the parasitic coupling capacitance between\nthe two coils was neglected in this work since the complexity\nof the model and the analysis were considerably increased\nwhile the effect is marginal at the frequency of interest (below\nSRF) when it was considered. (Some of the effects of this\ncoupling capacitance can be found in [28].) The simple low-\nfrequency model has been widely used as a core circuit to\ncharacterize transformers in many studies (e.g., [10]–[15])\nsince the physical size of transformers is usually designed to\nbe noticeably less than the guided wavelength at the operating\nfrequency [27]. Therefore, it can reﬂect dominant physical\nphenomena occurring in a transformer with an inductance and\nmagnetic coupling of the windings at operating frequencies\nFIGURE 1. Low-frequency transformer model with two magnetically\ncoupled coils with load and source terminations.\nVOLUME 7, 2019 140981\nV.-S. Trinh, J.-D. Park: Theory and Design of Impedance Matching Network\nwell below the SRF of the transformer. The validity of a\nlow-frequency model is discussed in Section III.\nB. IMPEDANCE MATCHING WITH TWO MAGNETICALLY\nCOUPLED COILS\nAn important criterion that designers should consider when\nusing a transformer is the amount of power delivered from\nthe source to the load, especially in applications such as\nWPT [3], [25], and impedance transformation in power\nampliﬁers [1], [2], [4], [21], [22], [29]. We can assess the\nefﬁciency of the network with regard to the power from the\ntransducer power gain GT , which is deﬁned as the ratio of\nthe power delivered to load PL to the power available from\nsource Pavs [16]:\nGT = PL\nPavs\n=PL\nPin\nPin\nPavs\n=η(1 −|0s|2), (1)\nwhere Pin is the input power delivered from the source to\nthe network (including the transformer and load) and η =\nPL /Pin is the power efﬁciency (operating power gain) of the\nnetwork [20]. 0S is the source reﬂection coefﬁcient, and it is\ngiven by\n0S =Zin −Z∗\nS\nZin +ZS\n, (2)\nwhere ZS and Zin are the source and network impedances,\nrespectively. Thus, impedance matching is important to\nobtain an optimal transducer power gain for a given pas-\nsive network. On the source side, Zin should be the con-\njugate of the source impedance: Zin = Z∗\nS . Similarly,\nthe load impedance ZL should be the conjugate of the output\nimpedance Zout on the load side: ZL = Z∗\nout . The former\ncondition maximizes the power delivered from the source to\nthe network when the source is given, and the latter condition\nmaximizes the power delivered to the load when the source\nand transformer are given.\nWe can consider the transformer as a two-port network\ndriven by a source and terminated by a load, as shown\nin Fig. 1. The transformer is modeled using two magnetically\ncoupled inductors, and the load and the source impedances\nare given by\nZL =RL +jXL and ZS =RS +jXS , (3)\nwhere RL and XL are the equivalent series resistance and\nreactance of the load, respectively, while RS and XS are\nthe equivalent series resistance and reactance of the source,\nrespectively. The relationship between the input ( V1) and\noutput ( V2) voltages for the input and output currents, given\nby I1 and I2, respectively, can be written as\n[V1\nV2\n]\n=\n[(R1 +jωL1) −jωM\njωM −(R2 +jωL2)\n][I1\nI2\n]\n, (4)\nV2 =ZL I2, (5)\nwhere ωis the angular frequency, and M(=k(L1L2)1/2) is the\nmutual inductance between the primary inductor ( L1) and the\nFIGURE 2. Maximum transducer power efficiency (GTmax [%]) versus\nk2Q1Q2.\nsecondary inductor ( L2). The quality factors Q1 and Q2 of the\nprimary and secondary inductors are calculated as\nQ1 =ωL1\nR1\n; Q2 =ωL2\nR2\n. (6)\nAs shown in Appendix A, simultaneous conjugate match-\ning on both sides of the transformer can be achieved either\nwhen the transformer is ideal ( R1 =R2 =0) or when ZS and\nZL satisfy the following conditions:\n{ XL =−ωL2,XS =−ωL1 (7.1)\nRL =R2\n√\n1 +k2Q1Q2,RS =R1\n√\n1 +k2Q1Q2. (7.2)\nThe equations in (7) are the derivation of the general con-\njugate matching condition based on Z-parameters presented\nin [17] for the transformer model with the impedance matrix\nin (4).\nC. FIGURE OF MERIT FOR A TRANSFORMER, OBTAINED\nFROM THE TRANSDUCER POWER GAIN\nUnder the simultaneous conjugate matching conditions on\nboth sides of the transformer, the maximum of the transducer\npower gain GTmax is calculated in Appendix B as\nGT max =1 −2\n√\nk2Q1Q2 +1 −1\nk2Q1Q2\n. (8)\nIt is noteworthy that because the optimal transducer power\ngain in (8) is obtained under the condition 0s =0, it even-\ntually equals the optimal power efﬁciency derived in [20],\nwhich is presented in (1). Fig. 2 shows the maximum trans-\nducer power gain as a function of k2Q1Q2. (The simulation\nand measurement setups are described in Sections III and V ,\nrespectively.) Clearly, GTmax increases rapidly as k2Q1Q2\nincreases in the low-value region of the x-axis and saturates at\na sufﬁciently large value. Therefore, k2Q1Q2 is a reasonable\ncandidate for the ﬁgure of merit, which can be used to assess\nthe quality of the designed transformer.\nFor a given transformer, the load and source impedances\ncalculated from (7) can be used for performing simultaneous\nconjugate matching for both source and load ( 0L =0S =0),\nwhich would maximize the transducer power gain.\n140982 VOLUME 7, 2019\nV.-S.

VERIFICATION OF THE PROPOSED ANALYSIS WITH\nAN ON-CHIP TRANSFORMER IN A 3D EM SIMULATION\nIn this section, we discuss the examination of a typical on-\nchip winding transformer (presented in Fig. 3) that is widely\nused for interstage matching in millimeter-wave circuits in\nsilicon technologies [1], [2], [29]–[31]. In this study, an on-\nchip transformer was designed in a 0.18 µm CMOS pro-\ncess by using an 8.625 µm thick back-end-of-line (BEOL)\nstack and a 300 µm thick silicon substrate. The complex\ndielectric stacks from the BEOL process were simpliﬁed into\n14 equivalent dielectric layers, each of which was calculated\non the basis of a series capacitance approximation veriﬁed in\nprevious works [2], [4], [32], [33]. The conductivity of the\nsubstrate was set to 10 S/m. An on-chip winding transformer\nwith a side-coupled structure was implemented using a 2 µm\nultra-thick metal. The primary winding inductor had one turn,\nand its width was set to 8 µm, while the secondary inductor\nhad two turns and was 6 µm wide. The gap between two\nadjacent turns was set to 3 µm, and the inner diameter ( din)\nof the octagonal winding inductor was 90 µm. In microwave\ninductor and transformer design, a deﬁnite return path is\nnecessary to achieve good agreement between the HFSS\nsimulation and measurements. Therefore, we placed ground\ntiles all over the area, which was modeled as a square ring\naround the transformer, as shown in Fig. 3.\nWe performed 3-D electromagnetic (EM) simulations\nwith HFSS for the transformer design to attain its\ntwo-port Z-parameters. Subsequently, the parameters of the\nlow-frequency transformer model R1, R2, L1, L2, and k were\nextracted as below (depicted in Fig. 4)\nRi =Re {zii}; Li =Im {zii}\nω ;k =\n√Im {z12}×Im {z21}√Im {z11}×Im {z22}\n(9)\nwhere i ={1,2}; zij with i, j ={1,2}is the element of the\nextracted Z-matrix.\nThe simulated SRF was 51.8 GHz for the designed\n2:1 on-chip transformer. The effective inductance of the two\nwindings increased rapidly near the SRF because of the reso-\nnance between the winding inductor and the parasitic capac-\nitances seen from the winding inductor. When the operating\nfrequency exceeded the SRF, the effective reactance of each\ninductor became capacitive.\nFIGURE 4. Simulated (dashed line) and measured (solid line) values of\nthe effective parameters of the on-chip 2:1 transformer.\nFIGURE 5. Simulation results for several power gains of the 2:1\ntransformer as a function of the operating frequency.\nFig. 5 shows the simulation results for various power\ngains of the on-chip transformer when the source and load\nimpedances were conjugately matched at 10 GHz. The\nanalytical expressions given in (7) were used to achieve\nsimultaneous conjugate matching. Here, GTmax (or Gmax ) is\nthe maximum transducer power gain with 0S = S∗\n11 and\n0L = S∗\n22; GA(= Pavn/Pavs) is the available power gain,\nwhich is deﬁned as the ratio of the power available from\nthe transformer ( Pavn, or the maximum power that can be\ndelivered to the load) to the power available from the source;\nand GP (=PL /Pin) is the operating power gain (or the power\nefﬁciency η of the transformer in [20]) [16]. As evident,\nall the mentioned power gains had the same value when\nboth source and load were simultaneously conjugate matched\nat 10 GHz. Fig. 5 presents the simulation results of the\nVOLUME 7, 2019 140983\nV.-S. Trinh, J.-D. Park: Theory and Design of Impedance Matching Network\nFIGURE 6.

S11 on the source side and S22 on the load side\nwere less than −30 dB, while S21 reached its maximum value\nat 10 GHz.\nFig. 6 shows a comparison between GTmax calculated from\n(8) (which is also the maximum power efﬁciency ηmax ) and\nGTmax simulated with Spectre TM; both parameters are plotted\nagainst the normalized frequency ( fnor =fo/SRF) for SRF =\n51.8 GHz. We determined the percentage error, deﬁned as\nthe difference between the simulated and calculated values\ndivided by the simulated value, to quantify the limitation\nof the low-frequency model. At a relatively low frequency\n(fnor <0.72 or f <37.3 GHz) compared with the SRF of\nthe transformer, the calculated GTmax matched well with the\nsimulated GTmax within an error of 10%.\nIt is quite encouraging that such a simple low-frequency\nmodel can provide promising results in a frequency range\nof around 72% of the SRF of the transformer coil. As the\noperating frequency approaches the SRF of a transformer,\nthe parasitic coupling capacitances between the primary and\nthe secondary windings and between them and the substrate\nstart to play a vital role [27]. Furthermore, with an increase\nin the operating frequency, the mutual resistance associated\nwith the eddy currents induced by the coupled magnetic\nﬂux of another inductor increases the power loss [34]–[36].\nTherefore, the operating frequency of the on-chip transformer\nis typically chosen to be well below the SRF since the input\nand output impedances of the transformer change drastically\naround the SRF. Accordingly, the low-frequency model used\nin this study is acceptable for this typical case.\nIV. TRANSFORMER MATCHING CONFIGURATION WITH\nA PARALLEL TUNING CAPACITOR\nA. TRANSFORMER MATCHING NETWORK\nCONFIGURATIONS\nFig. 7(a) shows a compact lumped circuit model for a typ-\nical monolithic transformer derived from two magnetically\ncoupled coils and intended for operation at a relatively low\nfrequency compared with the SRF [27]. Aoki et al. trans-\nformed this low-frequency model into a T-model, and they\nused the T-model for investigating the power efﬁciency ( η=\nPL /Pin) as well as the power enhancement ratio (PER) of a\ntypical transformer for impedance transformation [20]; they\npresented conditions for the optimal power efﬁciency of a\nFIGURE 7. Impedance transformation in a transformer with a load, series\ntuning capacitors, and an extra tuning capacitor in parallel to the load.\nFIGURE 8. Configuration for impedance transformation in a transformer\nwith a tuning capacitor in parallel with the load, and the series equivalent\ncircuit of the configuration.\ntransformer network with three additional capacitors. Such\na network is shown in Fig. 7(b). The series capacitor CL in\nseries with the load is tuned to maximize the transformer’s\npower efﬁciency, and another capacitor COUT in parallel\nwith the load is used to reduce the turn ratio n, which\nmakes it possible to use a transformer with a reasonable turn\nratio while keeping the PER unchanged. On the source side,\na shunt capacitor CS is added to adjust the input reactance\nto the desired value. More recently, a conﬁguration with a\ntuning capacitor in parallel with the load has been widely\nused [21]–[24]; the conﬁguration is shown in Fig. 8. In this\nconﬁguration, the parallel capacitor can increase the efﬁ-\nciency of the transformer (if it is tuned to a proper value)\nas well as transform the equivalent series load resistance to\nReq<RL , which relaxes the requirement for the turn ratio n.\nMoreover, when an active device is used as the load, the tun-\ning capacitor can absorb uncalculated parasitic capacitances\nof the device.\nAlthough this conﬁguration with a parallel capaci-\ntor (Fig. 8) has been widely used in implementing a\ntransformer-matching network, to the best of the authors’\nknowledge, no analytical design equations have been reported\nso far. Such equations must be readily applicable in the hand\ncalculation at the early stage of design. It should be noted that\nthe conﬁguration in Fig. 8 is different from that in Fig. 7(b).\nWhen we transform the parallel network conﬁguration ( RL\nin parallel with CL or a tuning capacitor Ct ) in Fig. 7 to\n140984 VOLUME 7, 2019\nV.-S.

Park: Theory and Design of Impedance Matching Network\nthe series equivalent circuit ( Req in series with Ceq),\nit is easy to confuse the parallel conﬁguration (shown\nin Fig. 8) with its series counterpart (shown in Fig. 7b).\nThus, the optimization conditions of the load with a parallel\ncapacitor are different from those for the network presented\nin Fig. 8.\nIn the following, for a transformer network with a capacitor\nin parallel with a resistive load, we present design formulae\nthat can be used for achieving optimum power efﬁciency by\nchoosing the optimal parallel capacitor.\nB. CALCULATION OF OPTIMAL LOAD AND SOURCE\nIMPEDANCES FOR A GIVEN TRANSFORMER\nFor the load impedance, given by ZL = RL + jXL ,\nin Fig. 7(b) (excluding COUT ), the power efﬁciency (calcu-\nlated in Appendix C) is given by\nη= RL\n(RL +R2)+R1 (RL +R2)2+(ωL2+XL )2\n(ωM)2\n. (10)\nIf RL is independent of XL (=−1/ωCL ), η is maximized\nat XL =−ωL2, which is identical to the condition presented\nin [20].\nLet us consider the transformer with a load and a tuning\ncapacitor ( CL = Ct ) in parallel with the load, as shown\nin Fig. 8. The equivalent series reactance and resistance of\nthe load are given by\nReq = RL\n1 +(ωRL Ct )2 ; Xeq =− ωR2\nL Ct\n1 +(ωRL Ct )2 . (11)\nBy replacing the calculated values from (11) with the\ncorresponding quantities in (10), the power efﬁciency can be\nexpressed as a function of Req and Xeq. However, Req is a\nfunction of Xeq when Ct is tuned for ﬁxed RL . Therefore,\nwe should not substitute Xeq with the aforementioned opti-\nmum value ( −ωL2) of XL for maximizing η.\nIn order to calculate the value of Ct that maximizes η,\nwe express ηas follows:\nPloss\nPL\n=1\nη −1 =1 +(ωRL Ct )2\nRL\n×\n\n\n\nR2 + R1\n(ωM)2\n\n\n(\nR2 + RL\n1 +(ωRL Ct )2\n)2\n+\n(\nωL2 − ωR2\nL Ct\n1 +(ωRL Ct )2\n)2\n\n\n\n\n\n,\n(12)\nwhere Ploss is the power dissipated in the transformer. The\nratio Ploss/PL should be minimized to maximize η.\nBy denoting x =ωRL Ct , this ratio can be expressed as\nPloss\nPL\n=ax2 −2bx +c, (13)\nFIGURE 9. Plot of the power efficiency versus the value of the parallel\ntuning capacitor for the on-chip 2:1 transformer at 10 GHz.\nwhere\na =R2\nRL\n+R1\nRL\nR2\n2 +(ωL2)2\n(ωM)2 ; b =R1L2\nωM2 ;\nc =a +(2R2 +RL )R1\n(ωM)2 . (14)\nBecause a >0, the ratio Ploss/PL is minimized at x =b/a,\nwhere we can obtain the optimal parallel tuning capacitor\n(Ctopt ) as\nCtopt = L2\nR2\n2(1 +Q2\n2 +k2Q1Q2) ≈ 1(\nk2 +1\n)\nω2L2\n⏐⏐⏐⏐⏐\nQ1=Q2\nQ1Q2(1+k2)≫1\n(15)\nAt this point, the maximum power efﬁciency is given by\nη(Ctopt ) = 1\n1 +c −b2\na .\n(16)\nAs evident from (15), the optimum value of the parallel\ncapacitor Ctopt is less sensitive to the quality factors of the\ntransformer if Q1 is close to Q2 and the product Q1Q2 (k2+1)\nis sufﬁciently higher than unity. By applying Ctopt in (15)\nto (11), we obtain Xeqopt , which differs from −ωL2 used in\nFig. 7(b). Fig. 9 shows plots of the calculated and simulated\nefﬁciency versus Ct for two values of RL at 10 GHz. Except\nfor the tuning capacitor ( CL = Ctopt ) in parallel with the\ngiven load resistance RL , the simulation setup was the same as\nbefore. Owing to the parasitic capacitor of the two windings,\na peak discrepancy of around 2.5% was observed between\nthe efﬁciency calculated from (15) and the simulated value.\nInterestingly, Ctopt is not a function of RL .\nWe can also obtain the same design formulae by using a\ndifferent approach. When both source and load values are\nVOLUME 7, 2019 140985\nV.-S. Trinh, J.-D. Park: Theory and Design of Impedance Matching Network\nFIGURE 10. Plot of simulated power gains versus the value of the parallel\ntuning capacitor (Zs is calculated from (7) andRL is given by (18)).\nset, it is desirable to ﬁnd the impedance matching condi-\ntion on both sides of the transformer so that the maximum\ntransducer power gain, which is also the maximum power\nefﬁciency ( ηmax = GTmax ) is obtained. The source and\nload impedances are given by (7) to achieve this condition.\nTherefore, the equivalent series resistance Req and equivalent\nseries reactance Xeq should satisfy the conditions :\n\n\n\nReq = RL\n1 +(ωRL Ct )2 =R2\n√\n1 +k2Q1Q2\nXeq =− ωR2\nL Ct\n1 +(ωRL Ct )2 =−ωL2.\n(17)\nBy solving these two equations, RLopt and Ctopt are calcu-\nlated as\n\n\nRLopt =R2\n√\n1 +k2Q1Q2\n(\n1 + Q2\n2\n1 +k2Q1Q2\n)\nCtopt = L2\nR2\n2(1 +Q2\n2 +k2Q1Q2).\n(18)\nNaturally, the optimum value of Ctopt in (18) is the same\nas that in (15). Fig. 10 shows plots of the simulated power\ngains—GTmax , GT , and the operating power gain (or power\nefﬁciency η)—around Ct =Ctopt . In this veriﬁcation, ZS and\nRL are chosen so that 0S =0L =0 at the optimum value\nCtopt , which is calculated using (18); ZS is computed using\n(7) and (18) gives RL =RLopt .\nSimilarly, if the source has the same structure, which means\nthat the source consists of a resistor ( RSp) in parallel with\na tuning capacitor ( CSp), the optimum values of parameters\nRSp_opt and CSp_opt to maximize the transducer power gain\nare given by\n\n\n\nRSp_opt =R1\n√\n1 +k2Q1Q2\n(\n1 + Q2\n1\n1 +k2Q1Q2\n)\nCSp_opt = L1\nR2\n1(1 +Q2\n1 +k2Q1Q2).\n(19)\nV. EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION\nTo demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach,\nwe implemented various transformers with and without par-\nallel capacitors in a 0.18 µm CMOS process. A reference\ntransformer was also included to conﬁrm the validity of the\ntransformer model in HFSS, which is shown in Fig. 3 for\nFIGURE 11. Photographs of the on-chip transformers fabricated in\n0.18 µm CMOS technology: (a) the standalone 2:1 transformer, and\n(b) transformers with parallel tuning capacitors.\nFIGURE 12. Plots of optimum power efficiency versus frequency for the\non-chip 2:1 transformer.\ndin = 9µm. Fig. 11(a) presents a photograph of a fabri-\ncated transformer with two signal pads. The S-parameters\nof the transformer were measured and de-embedded from\nthe pads and transmission lines that did not belong to\nthe transformer. Parameters of the low-frequency model\ntransformer—k, L1, L2, Q1,and Q2—were then extracted and\ncompared with those extracted from the simulation, which\nare shown in Fig. 4. The maximum power gain ( GTmax ) was\nalso extracted from the measured S-parameters; it is depicted\nin Fig. 2 along with plots of calculated and simulated values.\nFig. 4 shows that the measured inductances and coupling\ncoefﬁcients ﬁt the simulation results quite well. By contrast,\nsimulation results in the high-frequency region ( f >7 GHz)\nshowed that the measured quality factors of the two coils were\ndegraded. The optimistic loss consideration in the model,\nwhich does not hold true in a real environment, may cause this\ndiscrepancy. Speciﬁcally, the loss tangents of the dielectric\nmaterials depend on the frequency in the real case while\nthey were assumed to be constants in HFSS which were\nextracted at low frequency region. In addition, the rough\nmetal surfaces in the fabricated transformer could cause more\nloss at high-frequency region [37].\nBecause the maximum power gain is suppressed quickly\nwhen the product k2Q1Q2 becomes large (as shown in Fig. 2),\nthe GTmax extracted from measurements was still comparable\nto the simulated value (as shown in Fig. 12), regardless of\nthe degradation of the measured quality factors Q1 and Q2\ncompared to those simulated (depicted in Fig. 4). In addition,\nin the high-frequency region (compared to the SRF), the par-\nasitic capacitor also plays a role in the increase in GTmax ,\nas shown in Fig. 6.\n140986 VOLUME 7, 2019\nV.-S. Trinh, J.-D. Park: Theory and Design of Impedance Matching Network\nTo verify the analysis proposed in section IV , we measured\nseveral fabricated transformers with parallel capacitors at the\nload; they are presented in Fig. 11(b). The S-parameters were\nde-embedded from the RF pads and extra transmission lines.\nSubsequently, power efﬁciencies for speciﬁc loads of 50 and\n100 were extracted (Fig. 9). The measured data indicated\nthat the optimum Ct was the same for the two loads and\nthat it deviated from the simulation value by around 20 fF\n(nearly 7%). The shift in the measured Ctopt is because of the\ndifference between the fabricated transformer and its model;\nthis is shown by the extracted parameters in Fig. 4. Another\nreason could be that the nominal capacitance speciﬁed by the\nmanufacturer was different from the actual value because of\nprocess variations. From the extracted parameters of the fab-\nricated transformer, the optimum parallel load resistor RLopt\nwas calculated to be 103 by using (18). Therefore, the case\nof RL =100still provided a higher power efﬁciency, which\nwas conﬁrmed by measurements when Ct was around its\noptimum value.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nWe present a systematic analysis of and design formulae for\nan impedance matching network with a two-winding trans-\nformer. To develop design guidelines for the optimization of\na transformer network, we investigated the role of the resistive\nand the reactive parts of the source and load in achieving the\nmaximum power transfer. We present the design formulae,\nobtained from the aforementioned analysis, for the optimum\nsource and load impedance of a given transformer for the case\nwhere a parallel tuning capacitor is used to achieve optimal\npower transfer in the transformer network. The validity of the\nproposed formulae was veriﬁed for a 2:1 on-chip transformer\nsimulated and measured in a 0.18 µm CMOS process with\na 3D EM simulator (HFSS). The results of the present study\nare widely applicable to various sectors in the ﬁelds of RFICs,\nWPT, and any transformer network operating below the trans-\nformer SRF.\nAPPENDIX A\nFrom (4) and (5), we can obtain the input impedance as\nZin =V1\nI1\n=\n{\nR1 + (ωM)2 (R2 +RL )\n(R2 +RL )2 +(ωL2 +XL )2\n}\n+j\n{\nωL1 − (ωM)2 (ωL2 +XL )\n(R2 +RL )2 +(ωL2 +XL )2\n}\n.

This shows that when a transformer is ideal,\na conjugate match on the source side leads to one on the load\nside.
