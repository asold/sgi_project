  "abstract": "Transformers in electric power systems are of great importance, with significant effects on the distribution of electric energy. The modeling of this machine, considering the various usable connections, requires a more detailed analysis for better results. Thus, the objective of this work is to propose a three-phase transformer model including the neutral in the admittance matrices, the ground impedance, taps settings and also the magnetizing branch.",
