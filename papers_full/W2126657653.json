It can involve the entire autonomic nervous system. Among the\nmost serious DAN is cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN), which encompasses\ndamage to the autonomic nerve fibers that innervate the heart, affecting heart rate and\nblood pressure control and vascular dynamics. Diabetes-related CAN occur in one-quarter\nof the subjects with Type 1 diabetes and in one-third of those with Type 2 diabetes. CAN is\nassociated with increased mortality, silent myocardial ischemia, and may even predict the\ndevelopment of stroke [2]. While DAN can be clinically evident, manifested by dysfunction\nof one or more organ systems ( e.g. cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, sudomo-\ntor, or ocular) [3], it is frequently subclinical and asymptomatic.\n* Correspondence: \nhumberto@utfpr.edu.br\n2 School of Electrical \nEngineering and Applied \nComputer Sciences-CPGEI, \nFederal University of \nTechnology-Paraná, Curitiba, PR \n- Brazil\nFull list of author information is \nFerrari et al. BioMedical Engineering OnLine 2010, 9:26\nhttp://www.biomedical-engineering-online.com/content/9/1/26\nPage 2 of 16\nA recent statement of the ADA [4] concerning diabetic neuropathies recommends that\nscreening should be instituted at diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes and 5 years after the diag-\nnosis of Type 1 diabetes. Screening might comprise a history and an examination for the\nsigns of autonomic dysfunction. Earlier iden tification of these high-risk individuals is\nclearly important, as it would allow for the deployment of management strategies to\nimprove long-term outcomes. If diagnosis is delayed until the development of symp-\ntoms, the outcome is extremely poor, with a 5-year survival rate of only 50% [5].\nAlthough several conventional autonomic function tests exist to aid clinicians in the\nevaluation of DAN, they require specific equipments and well-trained personnel, and are\ntime-consuming to perform [6]. Additionally, these tests typically require active patient\nparticipation and compliance, leading to their use in a minority of subjects, mainly those\nwith advanced autonomic neuropathy who have already developed symptoms. There-\nfore, the development of new approaches for the early identification of DAN, i.e., before\nthe onset of symptoms, is desired. This would allow for interventions and management\nthat may result in reduced long-term complications, as previously reported [7]. In this\ncontext, simple and inexpensive approach to screen large number of subjects with diabe-\ntes for autonomic neuropathy would be valuable to minimize the enormous social and\neconomic burden caused by DAN, especially for subjects at a much higher risk, such as\nthose with undiagnosed CAN. The pupil dynamics analysis, i.e., dynamic pupillometry,\nhas the potential for supporting such a screening approach.\nPupil size, shape, and reactivity to light have been used as indicators of neurological\nfunction in brain-injured patients, particularly in comatose patients. There are circular\nand radial muscles that control the size of the pupil. The former is innervated by para-\nsympathetic fibers, and the latter, by sympathetic fibers. Thus, the pupil radius is con-\ntrolled by both the sympathetic and parasympathetic autonomic nervous system in\nresponse to environmental light, a mechan ism called the pupil light reflex. Therefore,\nthe pupillary radius response to an external light stimulus might provide an indirect\nmeans to assess the integrity of neuronal pathways controlling pupil size [8] and an early\nindication of DAN [9].\nSympathetic stimulation of α-1 adrenergic receptors causes the contraction of the\nradial muscle, and subsequent dilatation of the pupil (mydriasis). Conversely, parasym-\npathetic stimulation causes contraction of the circular muscle and constriction of the\npupil (miosis). The pupillary reflex is mediated by acetylcholine and noradrenaline, caus-\ning miosis and mydriasis, respectively. Thus, change in pupil size in response to a light\nstimulus is based on a functional equilibrium between sympathetic and parasympathetic\nactivity [10].\nIt is therefore reasonable to expect that generalized conditions of the autonomic sys-\ntem will affect the pupil response to the light stimulus [11]. Parasympathetic dysfunction\nmight cause relative mydriasis of the pupil in light conditions and diminished constrictor\nreflexes with or without pupillotonia, which is thought to result from aberrant re-inner-\nvations. Sympathetic dysfunction might cause relative miosis of the pupil in the dark,\nincreased re-dilatation lag, and attenuation of the startle reflex, as observed in Horner's\nsyndrome [12]. Investigations in subjects  with diabetes have revealed abnormal\nresponses of the pupil-radius modulation in some subjects, especially in those with dia-\nbetic neuropathy [9,13-18], supporting the potential of pupillometry to be used as a\nscreening tool for autonomic neuropathy in the diabetic population [15-17].\nFerrari et al. BioMedical Engineering OnLine 2010, 9:26\nhttp://www.biomedical-engineering-online.com/content/9/1/26\nPage 3 of 16\nPrevious studies have described the restin g pupil radius as a sympathetic parameter,\nand the reflex amplitude as a parasympathetic parameter in healthy and diabetic subjects\n[9,13-18]. However, there is very little evidence with regard to the relationship between\nthe pupil-iris ratio and other time-related parameters with autonomic neuropathy in dia-\nbetes subjects with and without CAN. In this study, the results of an investigative study\nof the pupil responsiveness to light flashes in healthy and diabetic subjects with and\nwithout clinical evidence of CAN has been presented. The study was performed with a\ncustom-built dynamic pupillometer [19] that allows the computation of a larger number\nof parameters when compared with commercially available pupillometers.\nMethods\nSubjects\nThis study comprised three groups: Group 1 - 16 healthy volunteers (9 males and 7\nfemales); Group 2 - 16 diabetic subjects without CAN (15 males and 1 females); and\nGroup 3 - 8 diabetic subjects with CAN (7 males and 1 females). The study was con-\nducted in the Diabetes Centre, Royal Hallamshire Hospital, University of Sheffield, UK.\nInformed consent was obtained from all participants. Subjects were not receiving any\ndrugs affecting sympathetic or parasympathetic pupillary function, and those with past\nhistory of ocular operations, nonsymmetrical pupil, misshapen pupil, or conditions\naffecting pupillary reflexes were excluded [20]. All diabetic subjects underwent standard\nblood and biochemical laboratory tests.\nOwing to the experiment setup, only the ri ght side of each participant was accessible\nfor pupillometry. The pupil reaction was assessed twice: first with one flash, and 5 min\nlater with 25 flashes. Both tests were performed in the right eye, and all the subjects were\ntested between 9 and 12 am. For all patients, at least 8 h of sleep was required in the pre-\nceding night without any hypoglycemic episode.\nThe pupil stimulator and response recorder\nFigure 1 illustrates the setup of the instrument, named Pupil Stimulator and Response\nRecorder (PSRR), developed to stimulate and record the pupil response to flashes of\nwhite light [19]. It consisted of a commercial monochromatic CCD analog video camera\n(EIA-RS-170 standard) that captures an image frame every 1/30 seconds; four infrared\n(IR) light emitter diodes (LEDs) with a diameter of 5 mm; five high-intensity bright white\nFigure 1 Setup of the Pupil Stimulator and Response Recorder (PSRR) instrument developed to per-\nform in vivo experiments.\n\nFerrari et al. BioMedical Engineering OnLine 2010, 9:26\nhttp://www.biomedical-engineering-online.com/content/9/1/26\nPage 4 of 16\nLEDs with a diameter of 8 mm; a 17-cm height aluminum cone section with extremity\ndiameters of 14.5 and 5.6 cm; an electronic current supply to the LEDs; a built unit for\ntiming control based on the microcontrol ler PIC16F873 (Microchip Technology Inc.,\nArizona, USA); and a Pentium IV 3 GHz Notebook with a PCMCIA frame grabber to\nrecord and process the pupil images. The aluminum cone was fixed in a printed circuit\nboard (that hold the IR and white LEDs), which was then fixed in the CCD camera. The\nIR and the high-intensity bright white LEDs were symmetrically placed around the CCD\nlens, as illustrated in Figure 1. The IR LEDs promoted the illumination with a high pupil\nto iris contrast, but without producing any pupil response. The lens focus was manually\nadjusted by rotating the aluminum cone. The pupil and the aluminum cone wall acted as\na mirror, reflecting the IR LEDs light. The light reflection in the cone wall caused too\nmany artifacts in the pupil image, making th e pupil-iris edge detection difficult during\nthe image processing phase. To avoid these artifacts, the aluminum cone interior was\nblackened.\nThe PSRR can stimulate the pupil with one flash or a series of 25 flashes (1-Hz fre-\nquency), with fixed intensity (250 cd) and duration (10 ms). The changes in the radius of\nthe pupil were evaluated as a function of several time-dependent and pupil-iris radius\nratio parameters.\nThe pupil radius was automatically determined for each frame in the recorded video\nstream. The offline image processing algorithm was implemented using MATLAB (The\nMathWorks Inc., Massachusetts, USA) environment and was divided into three major\nsteps: elimination of the IR LEDs light reflex within the pupil; enhancement of the image\nborders; and pupil and iris edge detection.\nFigure 2 shows the images obtained in some of the major algorithms steps until the\nbest circle that fits the pupil is found. Figure 2(a) shows the region of interest (ROI) that\nis cropped from the original image. First, the IR LED light reflection was detected using\nthe Canny edge detector with a threshold set to 0.8. The detector returned one pixel line\nthat makes a frontier between the white reflected and the dark pupil regions. These con-\ntours were then filled, forming a reference mask to change the white pixel in the pupil by\na gray value of 35. It is important to note that owing to our image acquisition system cap-\nturing the eye images under the same illumination condition, the pupil darkness of every\nsubject has a gray value around 35. Figure 2(b) and 2(c) shows the mask and the eye\nimage with the IR LED light reflection removed. This image was then edge enhanced\nusing a high-boost filtering [21], followed by  an intensity transformation through a 0.6-\ngamma function. The result is shown in Figure 2(d). A Canny edge detector with a 0.5-\nthreshold was then applied to find the frontier pixels between the pupil and iris, as\nshown in Figure 2(e). To determine the pupil radius, it was found that the best solution\nwas by convolving the image shown in Figure 2(e) with contour circle masks with differ-\nent radius (20-90 pixels, with 0.2 pixels of re solution), and determining the circle radius\nthat gives the maximum correlation.\nThis algorithm was even able to determine the pupil radius in those cases where the\npupil was under the eyelid or eyelashes, as shown in Figure 3(a) and 3(b).\nThe iris radius was automatically determined for each frame in the recorded video\nstream using the Hough Transform, followed by a canny edge detector algorithm [21].\nFerrari et al. BioMedical Engineering OnLine 2010, 9:26\nhttp://www.biomedical-engineering-online.com/content/9/1/26\nPage 5 of 16\nExperiments\nAll the subjects underwent two experiments. In the first experiment, the subject dark-\nadapted for 2 min leaning on the cone before a single light flash was administered. The\npupil response was recorded for 3 s. During  this period, the subject was instructed to\navoid or minimize blinking.\nFigure 2 Pupil radius measurement sequence.

BioMedical Engineering OnLine 2010, 9:26\nhttp://www.biomedical-engineering-online.com/content/9/1/26\nPage 6 of 16\nIn the second experiment, the subject dark-adapted for 2 min before 25 flashes were\nadministered at 1-s interval. The pupil response was recorded for 30 s. In both the exper-\niments, the other eye was covered with a black fabric to avoid any external light interfer-\nence.\nSingle light flash parameters\nFigure 4 shows a typical pupil response obtained from a healthy volunteer. It shows the\nradius of the pupil in each captured frame in pixels as a function of time.\nThe pupil reflex evaluation parameters can be defined as follows [10]:\n• Pupil-iris radius ratio in the frame preceding the flash, #7 in Figure 4, divided by iris\nradius;\n• Latency from flash exposure to the start of constriction (when pupil radius\ndecreases to 90% of pre-flash value), #2 in Figure 4;\n• Pupil-iris radius ratio (#6 in Figure 4 divided by iris radius) and latency (#4 in Figure\n4) to the smallest size of the pupil;\n• During the recovery phase: pupil-iris radius ratio (#5 in Figure 4 divided by iris\nradius) and latency to plateau at 75% of pre-flash pupil radius (#1 in Figure 4);\n• Duration of constriction (#3 in Figure 4);\n• Reflex amplitude - resting pupil radius (#7 in Figure 4) minus minimum pupil\nradius after the light stimulus (#6 in Figure 4);\n• Velocity of constriction - changing rate in the pupil radius over the reflex amplitude\ntime interval: reflex amplitude divided by #3 in Figure 4.\nTwenty-five light flashes parameters\nFigure 5 shows a typical pupil response obtained from a healthy volunteer. It shows the\nradius of the pupil in pixels for each captured frame as a function of time and the main\nparameters measured.\nFigure 4 Typical pupil reflex of a healthy volunteer after a 10-ms light flash intensity of 250 cd was trig-\ngered at zero second. The indicated parameters are defined as follows: 1-Latency time to reach the plateau \nat 75% of pre-flash pupil radius; 2-Latency time to the beginning of constriction; 3-Duration of constriction; 4-\nLatency to the largest constriction; 5- Radius of pupil on reaching the plateau; 6-Radius of pupil at largest con-\nstriction; 7- Radius of pupil before flash.\n\nFerrari et al. BioMedical Engineering OnLine 2010, 9:26\nhttp://www.biomedical-engineering-online.com/content/9/1/26\nPage 7 of 16\nFor the 25-flashes experiment, the pupil reflex evaluation parameters can be defined as\nfollows [10]:\n• Pupil-iris ratio in the frame preceding the 10th (#3 in Figure 5 divided by iris radius)\nand 25th flash (#5 in Figure 5 divided by iris radius);\n• Pupil-iris ratio of the smallest size of the pupil after the 10 th (#4 in Figure 5 divided\nby iris radius) and 25th flash (#6 in Figure 5 divided by iris radius);\n• Latency from flash exposure to the start of constriction after the 10 th and 25th flash;\n• Latency to the smallest size of the pupil after the 10th and 25th flash;\n• During the recovery phase: pupil-iris ratio (#7 in Figure 5 divided by iris radius) and\nlatency to plateau when the pupil radius reaches 75% of the pre-flash value;\n• Duration of constriction.\nAssessment for CAN\nA standardized set of cardiovascular tests was used to assess the prevalence of CAN. The\ntests were performed after a resting period of  10 min to ensure that the heart rate was at\nits baseline values. The tests included recording the electrocardiogram (ECG) to deter-\nmine the heart rate variability (HRV), and measurements of systolic and diastolic blood\npressure (BP). Four tests of HRV and one test of BP control were performed and evalu-\nated according to standard criteria [22]. Recordings were carried out at rest (HRV and\nBP), deep breathing (HRV), Valsalva maneuver (HRV), and active standing up (HRV and\nBP). The total duration of these tests was approximately 30 min. Diabetic subjects were\nclassified as having CAN if the results of two or more of these five autonomic function\ntests were below age-adjusted normative values [22].\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis for all the variables included the calculation of mean and standard\ndeviation (SD). One-way ANOVA and post-hoc Bonferroni statistical tests were used to\nFigure 5 Typical pupil reflex of a healthy volunteer in the experiment with a series of 25 flashes at 1-s \nintervals. The indicated parameters are defined as follows: 1- Radius of pupil before the first flash; 2- Radius of \npupil at largest constriction after the first flash; 3- Radius of pupil before the 10th flash; 4- Radius of pupil at larg-\nest constriction after the 10th flash; 5- Radius of pupil before the 25th flash; 6- Radius of pupil at largest constric-\ntion after the 25th flash; 7-Radius of pupil on reaching the plateau at 75% of pupil radius preceding the 25th flash.\n\nFerrari et al.

BioMedical Engineering OnLine 2010, 9:26\nhttp://www.biomedical-engineering-online.com/content/9/1/26\nPage 14 of 16\nDiscussion\nThe results of the first experiment confirm the findings of previous studies [9,12-15] of a\nsmaller resting pupil size and smaller reflex amplitude in subjects with diabetes.\nAccording to Smith and Dewhirst [18], the resting pupil size is mainly under sympa-\nthetic control and radius reduction is a sign of diminished sympathetic outflow to the iris\nmuscles. During the constriction phase, radius and time parameters mainly reflect para-\nsympathetic function. However, both the systems are active during the recovery phase\n[15].\nSmith and Smith [13] concluded that decreased reflex amplitudes in diabetic subjects\ncannot be ascribed to small pupil radius at rest, but are owing to a parasympathetic dys-\nfunction. From our results in Table 1 comparing healthy volunteers and diabetic subjects\n(with and without CAN), a significant reduction in the pupil radius at baseline and\namplitude of the pupil reflexes was found in both the diabetic groups. This might indi-\ncate that both sympathetic and parasympathetic dysfunction is affecting the pupillary\nreflex in these groups.\nThe significantly smaller initial pupil size  seen in the diabetes group without CAN\nwhen compared with healthy subjects might be regarded as an early sign of involvement\nof the autonomic nerve system before cardiac manifestation of systemic autonomic neu-\nropathy [9].\nWith regard to the second experiment, no comparison with previous findings was pos-\nsible because no similar studies have been reported in the literature. The second experi-\nment was found to lead to a gradual increase in the parasympathetic tone as a result of\nrepeated light stimulation. This condition provides a different level of balance between\nparasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system, which is not linearly correlated to\nthose of the first experiment. Although the two components of the autonomic nervous\nsystem may have abnormal tones, their combination may produce normal results during\nthe first experiment. Moreover, the pupil muscles may perform well during a single flash\nadministration, but this may not be true for repeated stimulation. The second experi-\nmental condition provided data on the flexibility of the pupil and autonomic nervous\nsystem.\nOur results provide novel evidence of the increased prevalence of both parasympa-\nthetic and sympathetic autonomic dysfunction in diabetic subjects with and without\nCAN, as evidenced by a significant reduction in the pupil-iris ratios and longer latency to\nstart of constriction at the 10\nth flash when compared with healthy volunteers. This shows\nthat dynamic pupillometry may be a valuable tool for the early detection of these abnor-\nmalities. Failure to show a statistically significant difference between the diabetes groups\nin the second experiment may be accounted to the small number of subjects in the CAN\ngroup. There is a need for larger as well as prospective studies to better understand this\nrelationship.\nDynamic pupillometry is a simple, inexpensive, and quick technique that requires min-\nimal specialist training. It has the other added advantage over the battery of cardiovascu-\nlar tests currently in use, in that it is no t reliant on active subject participation and\ncompliance. This study also suggests that it  is a more sensitive measure of autonomic\ndysfunction than the conventional autonomic function tests. It also suggests that pupil-\nlary autonomic dysfunction occurs early, before a more generalized impairment of the\nautonomic nervous system, in diabetes.\nFerrari et al. BioMedical Engineering OnLine 2010, 9:26\nhttp://www.biomedical-engineering-online.com/content/9/1/26\nPage 15 of 16\nThe pupil-iris ratio in darkness and the pupil reflex amplitude seem to be the dynamic\npupillometry parameters most affected by al terations in the autonomic nervous system.\nThus, they might be useful in detecting early autonomic dysfunction in high-risk groups.\nConclusions\nIn summary, dynamic pupillometry results indicate that this simple and non inexpensive\napproach can be used as an aiding tool during the clinical examination carried out in the\ngeneral or specialized clinical settings. This method has the potential to significantly\nimprove the outcome in detecting the early onset of autonomic dysfunction in subjects\nwith diabetes mellitus.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nGLF, JLBM, HRG carried out the study, designed the study concept from a biomedical engineering perspective, designed\nthe instrumentation, carried out the numerical investigations and image processing of pupil images, analyzed the data,\nand prepared the manuscript.
