    "abstract": "Blaž Mesec, PhD, assoc. prof., emeritus, Faculty of Social Work, University of LjubljanaSummaryAn explorative test of the suitability of the language model of artificial intelligence (AI) ChatGPT for the qualitative analysis is presented. The data fed into the programe is a response from a social work student to an interview question about her study practice. ChatGPT was asked questions about identifying basic themes, concepts, typologies, and evaluations. The robot provided surprisingly appropriate answers, but it rejected self-critically the request for professional conceptualization. The conclusion of the informal experiment is that ChatGPT is a useful tool in qualitative analysis, provided that the researcher can ask appropriate questions (prompts). However, the output of the robot must be evaluated and supplemented by a human researcher before final report and publication. The issue of authorship and responsibility is raised.",
