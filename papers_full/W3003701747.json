To overcome limits on total acceleration achievable, specially\nshaped drive beams can be used in both linear and nonlinear plasma wakeﬁeld accelerators (PWFA),\nto increase the transformer ratio, implying that the drive beam deceleration is minimized relative to\nacceleration obtained in the wake. In this Letter, we report the results of a nonlinear PWFA, high\ntransformer ratio experiment using high-charge, longitudinally asymmetric drive beams in a plasma\ncell. An emittance exchange process is used to generate variable drive current proﬁles, in conjunction\nwith a long (multiple plasma wavelength) witness beam. The witness beam is energy-modulated\nby the wakeﬁeld, yielding a response that contains detailed spectral information in a single-shot\nmeasurement. Using these methods, we generate a variety of beam proﬁles and characterize the\nwakeﬁelds, directly observing beam-loaded transformer ratios up to R = 7 .8. Furthermore, a\nspectrally-based reconstruction technique, validated by 3D particle-in-cell simulations, is introduced\nto obtain the drive beam current proﬁle from the decelerating wake data.\nThe development of beam-based plasma wakeﬁeld ac-\nceleration (PWFA) schemes has provided a potential\npath to extremely compact high energy accelerators, due\nto its ability to sustain accelerating gradients well in ex-\ncess of 10 GeV/m [1]. PWFA uses a highly energetic,\nhigh charge bunched beam known as the drive, to ex-\ncite a nonlinear plasma density wave. The ﬁelds in this\nwave are used to accelerate a second bunch, known as the\nwitness, placed collinearly behind the drive. While this\nprovides a substantial enhancement in peak accelerating\nﬁeld over current state-of-the-art acceleration schemes,\nimprovements to energy transfer from the drive bunch\nto the witness, using bunch shaping, are necessary for\napplications.\nEnergy transfer from the drive beam to the witness is\nparameterized by the transformer ratio, which is deﬁned\nas R= |W+|/|W−|, the ratio between the maximum ac-\ncelerating ﬁeld experienced by the witness |W+|and the\nmaximum decelerating ﬁeld found inside the drive |W−|.\nIn the context of linear wakeﬁelds, it has been shown\n[2, 3] that the limit R< 2 exists for longitudinally sym-\nmetric beams, and that asymmetric beams, such as a\nlinear ramp proﬁle, can exceed this limit. Further work\n[4] showed that this idea can be extended by modifying\nthe linear ramp in the beam head region to reach even\nhigher transformer ratios.\nMethods of producing linearly ramped beam proﬁles\ninclude the use of: self-wakeﬁelds in dielectric structures\n[5]; anisochronous dogleg beamlines with nonlinear cor-\nrection elements [6]; laser pulse stacking at the photo-\ncathode; [7] and emittance exchange methods [8]. Emit-\ntance exchange (EEX) is a process [9] by which a trans-\nverse beam distribution is mapped onto the longitudinal\ncoordinate, a technique which allows ﬂexible longitudinal\nbunch shaping. EEX may also be used to provide a long,\ntemporally synchronized, witness bunch for single-shot,\nmulti-period wakeﬁeld measurements [10].\nRecent methods have been used to perform detailed\nstudy of wakeﬁelds with high transformer ratios in\ncollinear accelerator schemes including dielectric struc-\ntures [11] and plasmas [12]. In the latter, wakeﬁeld mea-\nsurements were made using shaped drive bunches and\na short witness bunch, showing high transformer ratios.\nHowever, the laser pulse stacking method of shape gen-\neration has an inherent limit in bunch charge achievable,\ndue to space-charge driven degradation of the proﬁle at\nlow energy. In this Letter we describe experimental mea-\nsurements that apply the EEX beam shaping technique\nat moderate energy, mitigating space-charge eﬀects, and\nproviding new tools for wakeﬁeld measurements. These\nbeams are employed to characterize plasma wakeﬁeld re-\nsponses from various high-charge, ramped drive bunches,\nusing a single-shot wakeﬁeld mapping technique [10] that\ncaptures essential elements of the PWFA process and\nprovides insight into the wakeﬁeld dependence on bunch\nshape.\nExperiments were conducted at the Argonne Wakeﬁeld\nAccelerator (AWA) at Argonne National Laboratory. A\ncesium telluride photcathode based, L-band electron gun\nproduced 15 nC bunches with a pulse length of 6 ps and\na near uniform transverse distribution [13]. Normal con-\nducting L-band accelerating cavities were then used to\naccelerate these bunches to 40 MeV. These beams were\ndelivered to the experimental beamline seen in Fig. 1. A\ntransverse mask was used to shape the horizontal projec-\ntion of the beam, which is subsequently mapped into the\narXiv:1910.08601v1  [physics.acc-ph]  18 Oct 2019\n2\nFigure 1. (Color online) Schematic of the beamline at the Argonne Wakeﬁeld Accelerator. (a) Beams are delivered to the\nexperimental section consisting of a mask, emittance exchange beamline, PWFA beamline and longitudinal phase space diag-\nnostic. Two transverse masks were used to shape the horizontal beam projection into a (b) linearly ramped or (c) linear ramp\nwith parabolic head, both with long witness bunches to sample the resulting wakeﬁeld. (d) The PWFA beamline is shown with\nmajor elements including YAG and optical transition radiation (OTR) screens to view the transverse beam proﬁle.\nlongitudinal coordinate with the EEX beamline.\nThe EEX beamline (Fig. 1a) consists of two dogleg\nsections separated by a transverse deﬂecting cavity, and\nis capable of generating a wide range of longitudinal cur-\nrent distributions [8]. In the EEX process, a beam parti-\ncle with a horizontal phase space coordinate of (x i,x′\ni) is\nmapped to a ﬁnal longitudinal position zf = (A+BSx)xi\nin the linear approximation [9], where coeﬃcients A, B\nare functions deﬁning the EEX beam optics, which in-\nclude transverse dispersion, longitudinal compression and\ntransverse deﬂection. The term Sx = dx′/dx represents\nthe slope of the x−x′ correlation, which can be tuned\nvia quadrupole settings before the EEX mask to opti-\nmize the longitudinal proﬁle [14]. Masks were used to\nshape the horizontal projection of the beam (Fig. 1 b,\nc), generating two drive proﬁles, a proﬁle ramped over\ntwo plasma wavelengths (Fig. 1b) and the same proﬁle\nbut with a parabolic head section added (Fig. 1c). Both\nmasks included a narrow slit used to create a long, low\ncharge witness bunch placed after the shaped drive. Af-\nter the EEX beamline, the longitudinal proﬁle still has\na strong correlation with the vertical dimension, which\nin turn smooths the current distribution after transport\nthrough the PWFA beamline (Fig. 1d) [15]. This corre-\nlation also prevents accurate measurement of the beam\ncurrent in the longitudinal phase space diagnostic, due\nto horizontal slitting.\nA hollow cathode arc (HCA) [16] plasma source was\nused to produce a 6 cm long plasma column with a di-\nameter of 8 mm and a averaged plasma density tunable\nover the range n0 = 0 .3 −1.3 x 10 14 cm−3 [17]. Ar-\ngon gas was injected between two concentric tantulum\ntubes which were heated to 2000 K, creating a thermal\nelectron current high enough to reach the discharge arc\nregime without the need for a kV class discharge starter.\nA 150 V, 200 µs pulse was used to discharge the plasma\nup to a current of 300 A. The plasma density is tuned\nusing this current as well as an external solenoid em-\nployed to conﬁne the plasma electrons. The longitudinal\nplasma density proﬁle on-axis was characterized using a\nLangmuir triple probe [18] which allows a simultaneous,\ntime resolved measurement of the plasma temperature\nand density. Beryllium vacuum windows with a thickness\nof 125 µm were used to isolate the plasma source from\nthe rest of the accelerator, which required an additional\nbeam waist location on either side of the plasma source\nto reduce emittance growth due to multiple scattering in\nthe windows [19].\nTo characterize the wakeﬁeld interaction a longitudinal\nphase space (LPS) diagnostic consisting of a transverse\ndeﬂecting cavity and a 20◦dipole spectrometer was used.\nThe transverse deﬂecting cavity streaks beam particles\nin the vertical direction according to their arrival time,\nwhile the spectrometer dipole maps the energy distri-\nbution onto the horizontal dimension. A horizontal slit,\nplaced directly upstream of the LPS diagnostic, was used\nto vertically collimate the beam to improve the temporal\nmeasurement resolution while reducing spurious energy\ngain signals from transverse electron motion.\nA simulation study informed by beam and plasma mea-\nsurements was performed using the 3D particle-in-cell\n(PIC) code WARP [20]. The beam size at the interaction\n3\npoint was constrained by optical transmission radiation\n(OTR) spot size measurements [21] and consideration of\nplasma focusing properties due to a non-adiabatic plasma\ndensity ramp [22, 23]. In the simulations, the estimated\nbeam emittance was obtained by using measurements of\nbeam size at the Be input window, along with a calcu-\nlation of rms divergence due to multiple scattering [19].\nA 40 MeV linearly-ramped drive beam with a length of\n5.4 mm, having short fall length, transverse sizeσx = 200\nµm, normalized emittance of 500 mm-mrad and charge of\n1.6 nC was injected into a n0 = 1.5 ×1014 cm−3 plasma.\nA 4 mm long witness with the same transverse charac-\nteristics as the drive and 0.18 nC of charge was injected\nafterwards to sample the multi-period wake.\nThe results of the simulation after the beam has trav-\neled 28 mm into the plasma are shown in Fig. 2. A clear\nrarefaction (blowout) region in the plasma is observed,\nwith a density spike occurring afterward ( np/n0 ≈147)\nin Fig. 2(a). The rarefaction boundary is notably oﬀ-axis\nfor some distance, collapsing only after the drive current\ndrops to near zero. The beam head expands freely, fol-\nlowed by a transverse pinch point where the ion column\nstarts to form and then a region where uniform focusing\nﬁelds from the ion column dominate [22]. Electrons in\nthe main body of the beam may escape the rarefaction\nregion due to an initial focusing mismatch.\nDue to the drives transverse proﬁle evolution, and the\nresulting change in the wakeﬁeld, it is appropriate to ex-\namine the time averaged wakeﬁelds’ contribution to the\nbeam energy change for each temporal slice of the beam\nrather than assuming an instantaneous quasi-static ap-\nproximation for the wakeﬁeld. In this interpretation, the\nlongitudinal phase space of near-axis particles seen in Fig.\n2(b) reveals the eﬀective transformer ratio over the entire\nbeam-plasma interaction. Only near-axis electrons are\nconsidered as those far oﬀ-axis do not take part in the\nusable interaction, and this condition closely matches the\nexperimental scenario, as these do not pass through the\nthin horizontal slit in the LPS diagnostic. Calculation\nof the time-slice energy centroid of the drive and witness\nyields an averaged wakeﬁeld proﬁle having a transformer\nratio of 7.3.\nDuring the experiment, the beam was transported\nthrough the plasma source while discharges were trig-\ngered at half the repetition rate of the accelerator to ac-\nquire alternating plasma-on/plasma-oﬀ shots, eliminat-\ning systematic variations in the LPS present before the\nplasma. The measured time-slice energy centroids of the\nplasma-oﬀ shots were averaged as a background, to ac-\ncount for beam jitter and charge ﬂuctuations. This back-\nground was then subtracted from single plasma-on mea-\nsurements, to give the wakeﬁeld proﬁle (Fig. 3). The\nunperturbed beam has a notable remaining longitudinal\nenergy chirp from the EEX shaping process. The beam\ntransported through plasma shows a high energy tail in\nthe drive and a periodic modulation of the witness.\nFigure 2.

(b) Calculated diﬀerence between background\nand plasma on beam slice energy.\nTo quantify the beam current proﬁle at the plasma in-\nteraction point, a reconstruction technique for calculat-\ning the longitudinal current density λb(ξ) was developed\nthat utilizes the longitudinal wakeﬁeld response E(ξ)\n4\n[24],\nλb(ξ) ∝ϵ0\ne\n(dE(ξ)\ndξ + k2\np\n∫ ξ\n−∞\nE(ξ′)dξ′\n)\n, (1)\nwhere ξ= z−ctand kp is the wave number correspond-\ning to the plasma density. This reconstruction assumes\na constant radial form factor, and considers the plasma\nwakeﬁeld response inside of the beam to be linear. Simu-\nlation studies have shown this to be an excellent approx-\nimation when the blowout region is small compared to\nthe plasma wavelength [25, 26]. This method is used to\nreconstruct the time averaged drive current proﬁle dur-\ning the wakeﬁeld interaction from the measured energy\nchanges.\nThe measured energy gain from the drive created from\nthe mask of Fig. 1b is shown in Fig. 4, along with a\nreconstruction of the drive current proﬁle. The recon-\nstructed drive proﬁle shows a nearly linear ramp over\ntwo plasma wavelengths as evidenced by the number of\nundulations in the decelerating wake - the separation be-\ntween neighboring minima of the wakeﬁeld in the drive\nis roughly equal to the plasma wavelength. In the case\nshown, a separation of 10 ps corresponds to a plasma\nwavelength of 3 mm and thus an average plasma density\nof 1.3 x 10 14 cm−3.\nFigure 4. (Color online) Reconstructed current proﬁle up to\nradial form factor showing linearly ramped driver (red) and\nassociated energy diﬀerence (blue) from the averaged wake-\nﬁeld showing R = 7.8+2.5\n−1.7.\nIn contrast to the drive region, the observed energy\nmodulation of the witness shows clear evidence of a non-\nlinear plasma wakeﬁeld response. As shown in simula-\ntion (Fig. 4) the nonlinear rarefaction and subsequent\ncollapse of plasma electrons to the beam axis produces a\ncharacteristic sawtooth longitudinal wakeﬁeld [27]. This\nwakeﬁeld form is evident in the witness bunch energy gain\nmeasurement. This observation also validates theoretical\npredictions that the maximum accelerating potential is\nasymmetric with respect to the maximum decelerating\npotential [28]. Furthermore, as the plasma wave in the\nnonlinear wake regime contains a number of harmonics\n[29] the transformer ratio may be substantially increased\ncompared to a single-mode wakeﬁeld. Indeed, the ob-\nserved transformer ratio of R = 7 .8+2.5\n−1.7 matches well\nwith this prediction, as it well-exceeds R< 6.3 for the\nsame proﬁle in the linear, single-mode regime [2]. This\nresult is supported by the 3D PIC simulations.\nFigure 5. (Color online) Reconstructed current proﬁle up\nto radial form factor showing linearly ramped driver with\nparabolic head (red), linear ﬁt of reconstruction (black), and\nenergy gain (blue) from the averaged wakeﬁeld showing a re-\ngion of uniform drive deceleration.\nWhile linearly ramped proﬁles provide a way to achieve\nhigh transformer ratios, perturbations to the head of the\ndriver may provide further beneﬁts in wakeﬁeld excita-\ntion. For example, the ramp can be modiﬁed through\nthe addition of a shaped head, which acts to ﬂatten the\ndecelerating ﬁeld inside the drive beam. This is desir-\nable, as it extends the beam-plasma interaction length\nby preventing partial depletion of the drive, while im-\nproving the overall transformer ratio. Figure 5 shows a\ndirect observation of this eﬀect, in a case where the head\nof the reconstructed drive bunch has a parabolic shape,\nresulting in a near uniform deceleration of electrons in\nthe linear region of the drive. The parabolic head has a\nlength of 6.7 ps which approaches one plasma period (8.9\nps). The plasma wavelength was calculated by measuring\nthe time between zero crossings in the witness ( n0 = 1.6\nx 1014 cm−3) in this case, as opposed to inside the drive,\ndue to the lack of distinct oscillations in the drive en-\nergy gain. This observation shows good agreement with\nanalytical calculations of the wakeﬁeld [4], as uniform\ndeceleration inside the drive occurs when the parabolic\nhead length approaches an integer wavelength long.\nIn summary, we demonstrate single-shot wakeﬁeld\nmeasurements of a PWFA in the nonlinear regime, with\ncontrol over drive beam shaping through use of the EEX\n5\nmethod. The two key ﬁndings from the experiment are\na recorded transformer ratio of 7 .8+2.8\n−1.8 from a linearly\nramped beam, and the observation of a near uniform de-\ncelerating ﬁeld for a drive beam with a parabolic head.\nThe former is signiﬁcant because enhancing the trans-\nformer ratio is a critical feature demanded in the design\nand deployment of next-generation wakeﬁeld accelerators\n[30]. The latter measurement complements and enhances\nthis ﬁnding, because the uniform energy loss condition\npermits a longer sustained interaction, as one expects in\nan optimized transformer ratio case. These aggregate re-\nsults validate the importance of experimental eﬀorts in\nlongitudinal beam shaping. Further, they open the door\nto accessing nonlinear PWFA conditions in a regime with\nless demanding requirements on the drive and plasma\ndensity than the use of an ultra-short bunch [31]. These\nadvantages must be weighed against possible enhance-\nment of beam breakup eﬀects in long beams, which is a\nsubject of future experimental investigations.\nThis work is supported by the Department of Energy,\nOﬃce of High Energy Physics , under contract No. DE-\nSC0017648.\n∗ roussel@ucla.edu\n[1] I.
