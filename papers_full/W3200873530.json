The more advanced tech-\nnology a person uses, the more vulnerable this technique\nis, and thus the threat of dangerous magnetic storms be-\ncomes relevant. In addition to various advanced techni-\ncal devices ( eg satellite of telecommunications networks,\nnavigation systems, etc.), magnetic storms can damage\nelectrical systems for the transmission of electricity, espe-\ncially power transformers, and cause large power outages.\n2 Geomagnetism and geomagnetic storms\nThe geomagnetic ﬁeld forms the Earth’s magneto-\nsphere [1-8]. The source of the geomagnetic ﬁeld are both\nphysical processes inside the Earth and physical processes\nin the ionosphere of the Sun. Thus, according to the\nsource, we distinguish between internal and external ge-\nomagnetic ﬁelds; both magnetic ﬁelds are superimposed.\n2.1 Internal geomagnetic ﬁeld\nThe idea of the Earth as a permanent magnetic dipole\n(William Gilbert, 1600) was abandoned after the dis-\ncovery that the Earth’s core had a temperature above\nCurie’s temperature. For example, at a depth of 100 km\nbelow the surface, the temperature is of the order of\n1000 ◦C, ie substantially higher than the Curie tempera-\nture. Since 1919, a model called geodynamo has physically\nexplained geomagnetism. According to this idea, the in-\nternal geomagnetic ﬁeld is induced by the rotational ﬂow\nof the Earth’s liquid core. Since it is a moving electri-\ncally conductive medium that is exposed to a magnetic\nﬁeld (very weak, such as the Sun’s magnetic ﬁeld), very\nstrong electric currents are induced in it, which gener-\nate a geomagnetic ﬁeld. This relatively simple model was\ninitially designed as stationary. However, he did not ex-\nplain the well-known fact that the internal geomagnetic\nﬁeld changes with time - there is talk of secular vari-\nations. Secular variations are very slow, being detected\non a scale of tens to thousands of years. Therefore, the\noriginal idea that the geomagnetic ﬁeld is induced by axi-\nally symmetrical, stationary ﬂow was abandoned and the\ngeodynamic model was gradually improved. Modern geo-\ndynamic theory envisages a very complex model, respect-\ning turbulent and non-stationary magnetohydrodynamic\nﬂow. This model has not yet been solved mathematically\neven with the help of powerful computers. However, an\napproximate solution was found, which well explains the\nsecular variations and the possibilities of polarity reversal\nof the Earth’s magnetic poles.\nThe intensity of the internal magnetic ﬁeld varies with\nplace on Earth. In our latitudes, the magnetic induction\nhas a value of about 44 nT, at the poles around 60 nT\nand at the magnetic equator around 30 nT. Due to the\nvery slow time course of secular variations, the inﬂuence\nof the internal geomagnetic ﬁeld on the electrical system\nis completely insigniﬁcant.\n1 Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Modelin g, University of West Bohemia, Plzen, Czech Republic, mayer @fel.zcu.cz\nhttps:/ /doi.org/10.2478/jee-2021-0034, Print (till 201 5) ISSN 1335-3632, On-line ISSN 1339-309X\nc⃝ This is an open access article licensed under the Creative Co mmons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License\n(http: / /creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/).\n250 D. Mayer : PROTECTION OF POWER TRANSFORMERS AGAINST THE EFFECT OF MAGNETIC STORMS\nFig. 1. Eruption at the edge of the solar disk observed by the\nSTEREO satellite [4]\n2.2 External magnetic ﬁeld\nThere are relatively fast variations of the geomagnetic\nﬁeld, which have their origin in solar activity [1-4]. One of\nthe manifestations of solar activity are solar ﬂares, Fig. 1.\nThese massive explosions produce intense electromag-\nnetic radiation in a wide range of spectra and create jets of\nsolar matter. Solar matter containing electrically charged\nparticles, especially electrons, protons and high-energy al-\npha particles, can be torn oﬀ. They spread at high speed\nthrough interplanetary space and are referred to as coro-\nnal mass ejection (CMA). Iheir ﬂow is called the solar\nwind. For the process of solar wind ﬂow through inter-\nplanetary space, the designation Space weather has been\nadopted. If a wave of the solar wind comes close to the\nEarth, its internal geomagnetic ﬁeld - the Earth’s magne-\ntosphere - prevents electrically charged particles from hit-\nting the Earth. Under the action of the Lorentz force, the\nelectrically charged particles of the solar wind move in the\ndirection of the magnetic ﬁeld lines of the magnetosphere,\nbypass the Earth, deform the original symmetrical shape\nof the internal geomagnetic ﬁeld and ﬂow further into in-\nterplanetary space. The Earth’s magnetic envelope thus\nshields the Earth from the solar wind, thus protecting the\nEarth’s biosphere. Without internal geomagnetism, there\nwould be no existing forms of life on our planet. Some of\nthe electrically charged particles of the solar wind pen-\netrate into the higher layers of the Earth’s atmosphere,\nionosphere, turn to the Earth’s magnetic poles and cause\nionization of the Earth’s atmosphere. With increased so-\nlar activity, the ionization is stronger and this process\nmanifests itself as aurora borealis. The movement of elec-\ntrically charged particles in the ionosphere represents an\nelectric current that induces an external magnetic ﬁeld\nin its vicinity. The waves of the solar wind then manifest\non the Earth by rapid variations of the external magnetic\nﬁeld.\nThe intensity of the external magnetic ﬁeld changes\nin the order of seconds or tens of seconds. Their ampli-\ntude varies: from small disturbances of 20 to 30 nT and\noccurring several times a day, to strong variations whose\namplitudes can reach up to hundreds of nT then there\nis talk of a geomagnetic storm. It usually takes two to\nfour days between a solar ﬂare and a magnetic storm on\nEarth. The frequency and intensity of magnetic storms\ndepends on the Earth’s position; they are higher near the\nearth’s magnetic poles, ie in the Nordic countries. A ge-\nomagnetic storms cannot be inﬂuenced or even averted\nby human possibilities, but a few hours before it aﬀects\nthe Earth, its intensity can be predicted and the area on\nEarth aﬀected by the storm can be determined approxi-\nmately. Next, we describe the device that can prevent the\ndestructive eﬀects of magnetic storms on power systems.\n2.3 Geomagnetic ﬁeld monitoring\nA worldwide network of geomagnetic observatories\nmonitors the geomagnetic ﬁeld [9]. In the Czech Repub-\nlic, the geophysical observatory is located in the village of\nBudkov near Prachatic and is one of the workplaces of the\nGeophysical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the\nCzech Republic. All three components of the geomagnetic\ninduction vector ( Bx, B y, B z) are measured continuously\nhere and the results are recorded, at 1 min intervals\nor at second intervals, respectively, with an accuracy of\n0. 1 nT. The results are then passed on to the World Data\nCenter in Boulder (USA) and the Edinbourgh Geomag-\nnetic Information Node (Scotland). The Space Weather\nPrediction Center (SWPC) publishes a three-day space\nweather forecast. The results are freely available on the\nInternet. In addition to continuous monitoring of the ge-\nomagnetic ﬁeld, solar activity is constantly monitored [3],\n[10]. In addition to observing solar ﬂares with solar tele-\nscopes, these phenomena are continuously monitored by\nsatellite (for example, SOHO and STEREO satellites) by\nthe US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administra-\ntion (NOAA), Boulder and the European Space Agency\n(ESA) Paris. At the moment of detection of coronary\nmatter heading to Earth, a mathematical calculation is\nperformed at the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSCF)\nto determine the density at which it will hit the Earth’s\nmagnetosphere and then predict the intensity and loca-\ntion of the magnetic storm on Earth. This information is\nthen passed on to the power system operators.\n3 Geomagnetic induced currents (GIC)\nThe geomagnetic ﬁeld B(t) acts on the earth’s crust\nand on metal structures placed above the earth’s surface,\neg on outdoor power lines. In this environment, an electric\nﬁeld E is induced, and because it is an electrically con-\nductive environment (with conductivity γ ), geomagneti-\ncally induced currents (GIC) of density J ﬂow through\nit. According to the law of electromagnetic induction and\nOhm’s law is valid\nrot E = − ∂B\n∂t , J = γE.

From (1) it fol-\nlows an important ﬁnding that the magnitude of GIC\ndepends on the derivation of the geomagnetic induction\nvector B(t), ie on the rate of variation of the external\ngeomagnetic ﬁeld, not on its magnitude, as is often mis-\ntakenly stated.\nThe magnetic induction B(t) and thus also the GIC\nhave a random time course, and although there is talk of\nrapid variations in the external magnetic ﬁeld, it changes\nrelatively slowly, compared to alternating electrical quan-\ntities of industrial frequency. Magnetic storms are changes\nin units of nT/min. Depending on the time, GICs es-\nsentially behave as direct current currents, we call them\nquasi-stationary. Only their ohmic resistances determine\nthe distribution of GIC in the conductors of the power\nsystem. Inductances and capacitances of the electrical\nnetwork do not aﬀect the GIC. In works [7,8] a method\nof determining the distribution of GIC in a general power\nsystem is formulated, which can be topologically arbitrar-\nily complex.\n4 Eﬀect of magnetic storm on\nunprotected power system\nThe essence of the destructive eﬀect of a magnetic\nstorm on the power system is explained using a simple\nsingle-phase model of the system according to Fig. 2. A\nsource of harmonic voltage (generator) u(t) of frequency\nf supplies electrical power to the system a long line of\nvhv to the place of consumption, where vhv/lv is trans-\nformed and supplies the distribution network, from which\nelectricity is taken by individual consumers. In Fig. 2, a\nload consisting of a resistor and an inductance represents\nthe distribution network. A magnetic storm character-\nized by magnetic induction B(t) acts on this electrical\nsystem. Vector B is a superposition of the internal mag-\nnetic ﬁeld (it does not change with time) and the external\nmagnetic ﬁeld (it changes ”slowly” with time, it is quasi-\nstationary). Only its vertical component Bz(t) is applied,\nie the component perpendicular to the drawing in Fig. 2.\nIn the loop formed by the high-voltage line, which is con-\nnected at its beginning and end to the high-voltage wind-\nings of the power transformers is induced (according to\nthe law of induction) a voltage\nV0(t) = dΦ\ndt = S dBz\ndt . (2)\nThis equation holds under the assumption that intensity\nof the geomagnetic ﬁeld Bz is equally distributed along\nthe high-voltage line. In (2), the magnetic induction ﬂux\nΦ is linked with a loop whose area is S = al , where l is\nthe length of the vhv line and a is the distance between\nthe conductors of the high voltage line.\n252 D. Mayer : PROTECTION OF POWER TRANSFORMERS AGAINST THE EFFECT OF MAGNETIC STORMS\n0\nB\ni1\ni1\nI1 I2\nL\nL1\nL2\n0\nFig. 4. The course of inductance of the power transformer winding\nduring supersaturation of its magnetic circuit\nThe induced voltage V0 in the loop results in an in-\nduced GIC I0 . The internal geomagnetic ﬁeld is station-\nary, ie according to (2) it does not contribute to the mag-\nnitude of the induced voltage V0 (ie not even to GIC I0 ).\nIn contrast, the external geomagnetic ﬁeld changes over\ntime, but ”slowly” (compared to the current supplied by\nthe generator i(t), whose frequency is 50 Hz), is quasi-\nstationary. Only the resistances in this loop limit the mag-\nnitude of the current I0 in the loop, formed by the vhv\nline and the high-voltage windings of both transformers.\nMeasurements on real power systems have shown that the\ninduced voltage V0 reaches in the order of up to hundreds\nof V during magnetic storms and the subsequent current\nI0 in the vhv line up to tens of A [11],[18].\nGeomagnetically induced current I0 is superimposed\nto the working current i(t) supplied by the source, the\ncurrent I0 + i(t) passes in the vhv line. Its rms value\nis a measure of dissipated thermal energy. (According to\nJoule’s law, the dissipated electrical energy per thermal\nenergy is proportional to the square of the rms current\nvalue.) This energy thermally endangers the conductors\nof the high-voltage line, but above all the high-voltage\nwindings of both transformers. The high-voltage line is\ndesigned as a bundle conductors and is dimensioned in\nsuch a way that there is no risk of thermal damage. It is\nmore complicated with transformers. Let us observe the\ncurrent i(t) in a high voltage line.\n• If there is no magnetic storm, GIC I0 = 0 and both\ntransformers operate in normal mode. The operating\npoint moves in the linear part of their magnetization\ncharacteristic, ie below the knee of this curve. The\npower system according to Fig. 2 is linear, all cur-\nrents and voltages in the circuit change harmoniously,\nFig. 3(a).\n• During a magnetic storm, a quasi-stationary voltage\nV0 is induced in the high-voltage line and a quasi-\nstationary GIC I0 passes through the line. Let us ob-\nserve the current ﬂowing through the vhv line. The op-\nerating point on the magnetization curve of the trans-\nformers is shifted by the value I0 , the zero position of\nthe operating point is 0, Fig. 3(b). In the half-period,\nwhen i(t) < I 0 the operating point moves in the linear\npart of the magnetization curve ( ie below the knee),\nthe system is linear and current overload of the trans-\nformers does not occur. However, in the half-period,\nwhen i(t) > I 0 the operating point passes to the non-\nlinear part of the magnetization curve ( ie at and above\nthe knee) and the current i(t) supersaturates the mag-\nnetic circuits of the transformers. The permeability of\nmagnetic circuits ( µ = B/H ) has decreased and thus\nthe inductance of the transformer windings will also\ndecrease, the system is nonlinear, Fig. (4). Due to the\nquasi-stationary current I0 , the magnetizing current\ncurve has changed its shape, its eﬀective value is con-\nsiderably higher than when the geomagnetic ﬁeld did\nnot aﬀect the system, ie when it was I0 = 0, the high-\nvoltage windings of both transformers become over-\nheated. This phenomenon is called semisaturation of\nmagnetic circuits. The theoretical solution [5,6] (and\nthe investigation of faults in practice [12] to [19] (show\nthat the current overload can range from 2.5 times to\nthree times the nominal value.\nV0\n=\nlv vhv lv\n2\n33\nu t( )\ni t + I( ) 0\n2\n1 1\nFig. 5.

Distribution of the quasi-direct current I0 into the current\nIf passing through the frequency ﬁlter 3 and into the current It in\nthe high-voltage winding of the transformer 2\n5 A new way of protecting transformer\nwindings from magnetic storms\nA new method of protecting the transformer windings\nconsists in connecting a frequency ﬁlter in parallel with\nthe high-voltage winding of both transformers during a\ngeomagnetic storm, Fig. 5. The frequency ﬁlter consists\nof a coil wound on a ferromagnetic core. It can be modeled\nby series connection of resistance Rf and inductance Lf ,\nFig. 6. The current I0 induced in the vhv line is divided\ninto the current If passing through the frequency ﬁlter\nand the current It in the high-voltage winding of the\ntransformer\nIf = Rt\nRf + Rt\n, I t = Rf\nRf + Rt\n, (3)\nAll three currents are quasi-stationary, so limited only\nby resistances.\n• A frequency ﬁlter with zero resistance ( Rf → 0) will\nprovide perfect protection for the transformer. Accord-\ning to (3), all current I0 then ﬂows through the fre-\nquency ﬁlter ( If = I0) , while no GIC passes through\nthe windings of the transformers ( It = 0). Such a fre-\nquency ﬁlter can be realized by a coil (with a ferro-\nmagnetic core), made of a high-temperature supercon-\nductor, brought into a superconducting state. It is a\nsuperconducting reactor, which includes a cryotechni-\ncal device that produces liquid nitrogen, which cools\nthe frequency ﬁlter coil to a critical temperature at\nwhich the coil resistance is Rf → 0. The advantage of\nthis frequency ﬁlter is perfect protection of the trans-\nformer winding, the disadvantage is the need cryotech-\nnical equipment.\nNote that superconducting coils are usually used to\ngenerate extremely strong magnetic ﬁelds, using ex-\ntremely high magnetizing currents. Thus, non-ferrous\n(”air”) superconducting coils are used for strong mag-\nnetic ﬁelds. In our case, however, the superconductor of\nthe frequency ﬁlter coil only serves to reach Rf = 0, so the\ncoil can have a magnetic circuit made of ferromagnetic\nmaterial, which is of course advantageous.\n• If the coil of the frequency ﬁlter is made of a common\n(not superconducting) material, for example from cop-\nper, Rf ̸= 0. The ﬁlter provides only partial protec-\ntion. (For example, when Rf = Rt , then It = 0 . 5I0. )\nFor partial protection of the transformers, a frequency\nﬁlter can be implemented with a conventional iron re-\nactor. The sharper the inequality Rf < R t , the more\neﬃcient the protection by the frequency ﬁlter, but the\ngreater the weight and dimensions of the reactor. The\nadvantage of this method of transformer protection\nis that it does not require cryotechnical equipment,\nthe disadvantage is only partial protection. As an ex-\nample, consider a frequency ﬁlter whose resistance is\nRf = Rt/ 4, ie the cross-section of its coil is four times\nlarger than the cross-section of the high voltage wind-\ning of the transformer. Then, according to (3), a quasi-\nstationary current in hv winding of the transformer is\nIt = 0 . 2I0 , ie only 20 percent of current I0 in the\nhv winding of the transformer in comparison with the\ncurrent in the unprotected winding. However, at the\ncost of the frequency ﬁlter having approximately four\ntimes the weight of the transformer’s hv winding.\nThe connection/disconnection of the frequency ﬁlter\nto the power system can be automated, Fig. 5. If a geo-\nmagnetic storm Bz(t) acts on the power system, a quasi-\nstationary voltage V0 and then a current I0 is induced\nin the vhv line. Its magnitude is monitored by sensor\n1. As soon as the current I0 reaches a preselected (ad-\njustable) value, it activates both switches 2 at the be-\nginning and end of the transmission path and connects\nfrequency ﬁlters in parallel to the high-voltage windings\nof both transformers. The current I0 , in whole or in part\n(depending on the type of frequency ﬁlter), does not ﬂow\nthrough the high-voltage windings of both transformers,\nbut through frequency ﬁlters. As soon as the geomagnetic\nstorm stops, the current I0 drops and the sensor acti-\nvates both switches 2, which disconnect both frequency\nﬁlters from the transformer windings. In addition to the\nquasi-stationary current I0 , an alternating current also\nﬂows through the frequency ﬁlters, which has an induc-\ntive character and the impedance of the ﬁlter coil deter-\nmines its magnitude. If this current increases the reactive\npower in the system and thus reduces the power factor\n(cos ϕ ) to undesirable values, it can be compensated in\nthe usual way, ie by connecting a compensator in parallel,\nwhich is most often a static capacitor.\nFigure 7 shows a three-phase network with transformer\nprotection by frequency ﬁlters at the point of connection\nto the distribution network. The three-phase supercon-\nducting reactor in connection Y is here connected to the\nhigh-voltage winding of a step-down power three-phase\ntransformer, connected between the high-voltage trans-\nmission line and the distribution network. The trans-\nformer winding is connected to the grounded Y-D node.\nSimilarly, at the point of connection of the generator\nto the step-up transformer, a superconducting reactor is\nconnected in parallel to the high-voltage winding of the\ntransformer.\n254 D.

However, frequency ﬁlters for complete or partial\nprotection of transformers can be used in cooperation\nwith power transformers that are part of any topologi-\ncally complex system.\n6 Older proposals on how to protect the\nenergy system from magnetic storms\nThe methods of protection of power transformers\nagainst magnetic storms proposed so far are generally\nimperfect. For completeness, we will remind them here.\n• Due to the predicted geomagnetic storm, a smaller\nor larger part of the system is switched oﬀ, which\nleads to a controlled collapse of the system. After the\nstorm subsides, the system is restored to its original\nstate. The disadvantage of this method of protection is\nthe breach of supplier-customer relations between the\nprovider and the consumer and, as a rule, the resulting\nneed to compensate for economic losses caused by a\npower outage.\n• The phenomenon of semisaturation, which is the cause\nof thermal overload and subsequent damage to trans-\nformers, develops only to a lesser extent in power\ntransformers whose magnetic circuit is strongly over-\nsized. In such robust transformers, the working area\nof the transformer lies in the linear part of its magne-\ntization characteristic during DC pre-magnetization.\nThe disadvantage is that the oversized, robust trans-\nformer is magnetically unused in normal operation.\nThe robust transformer has more weight and dimen-\nsions, more losses in iron and more noise. Due to the\nrare occurrence of magnetic storms, its positive prop-\nerties are used only sporadically and it is signiﬁcantly\nuneconomical in terms of investment and operation.\nWorks [20-23] describe a power electronic device that\nlimits a quasi-stationary GIC induced by a geomagnetic\nstorm to a three-phase vhv line by conducting it to ground\nand thereby limiting its input to the hv winding of the\npower transformer.\n7 Conclusion\nThe collapse of the electricity system is a serious tech-\nnical event, which, especially in densely populated areas,\ncan lead not only to huge economic losses, but also to\nthreats to the safety of the population. One of the com-\nmon causes of the collapse of the power system are rapid\nanomalies of the geomagnetic ﬁeld - magnetic storms. In-\ncreasing industrialization means that disturbances caused\nby magnetic storms are not uncommon, especially in the\nNordic countries, and have therefore recently received at-\ntention.\nThe presented work describes a new method of trans-\nformer protection, which uses frequency ﬁlters. Two types\nof frequency ﬁlters are described: ﬁlters with supercon-\nductor coils for complete protection, and ﬁlters with coils\nof common materials for partial protection. It is char-\nacterized by reliable exclusion, resp. limiting the occur-\nrence of current overload of transformers, low purchase\nprice, the possibility of easy adaptation to existing elec-\ntrical systems and then automatic, unattended operation.\nThe device is relatively simple and robust, which virtually\neliminates its failure rate.\nJournal of ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING 72(2021), NO4 255\nReferences\n[1] E.
