  "full_text": "The beginning of Cyber-necromancy: Replacing deceased loved ones \nwith AI agents \nTam-Tri Le 1,*, Ruining Jin 2 \n1 Independent researcher, Ho Chi Minh City 727300, Vietnam \n2 Civil, Commercial, and Economic Law School, China University of Political Science and Law, \nBeijing 100088, China \n* Correspondence: letamtri10@gmail.com \n \nAbstract \nGrieving the passing of loved ones is a great pain for every person, followed by intense emotional \ncoping. In the modern digital age, artificial intelligence (AI) technology enables more and more \nimmersive real-time interactions with simulations of deceased people base d on available data \nabout them. The strong emotional factor of grief can push people to generate demand for such \nservices, leading to attachment issues on personal levels, and markets of “grief tech” on collective \nlevels, whether open or hidden. The growth  of such technologies and services may eventually \nlead to new formal regulations, social norms, and ethical perceptions. This can be the start of the \nnormalization process of “Cyber-necromancy”, which carries major implications for human values \nin the face of potential digital immortality. \nKeywords: artificial intelligence; grief; emotional coping; digital technology; ethical concern \n \nAlmost all normal adults can relate to the heavy feeling of grief when loved ones pass away, either \nthrough direct personal experiences or acquired social knowledge. Depending on the personal \nconnection with the lost person, the psychological pain of such loss can be extreme and almost \nunendurable. In these difficult times, probably, even when rationally knowing the nature of a \nsimulated representation of the dead, people may still want to find solace in meeting and talking \nwith such an entity. In the modern digital era, artificial intelligence (AI) technology may help turn \nthis special desire into reality, for better or for worse.  Together with this novel notion of cyber -\nnecromancy come new ethical and existential considerations for human society. \nWanting to meet the dead when coping with unbearable sorrow \nLosing a loved one is painful. A person in the process of grieving may want to hold on to objects \nand events that represent or connect to the lost person in various ways, whether directly or \nindirectly. For example, this can be the corpse, ash, belongings, photographs, voice recordings, \nvideos, food, music, or visiting places, etc. While grief due to bereavement is a natural emotional \nresponse, and m any people can make the adjustment without professional psychological \nconsultation, it is still found to be associated with an increased physical health risk including \nmortality, especially in the early time following the loss [1]. The more intense the feeling of grief \nis, the more likely one will rely on emotional coping strategies. Overall, Schut proposed The Dual \nProcess Model (DPM) [2] as a comprehensive theoretical framework to illustrate two adaptive \ncoping strategies: Loss-oriented coping refers to the act of directing one's attention toward the \nprocessing of a specific part of the experience of loss ; On the other hand, restoration -oriented \ncoping involves focusing on the additional stresses that emerge as a consequence of the loss \nand grieving [3]. Loss-oriented coping methods involve the utilization of external activities, such \nas engaging in reminiscence or sustaining symbolic linkages, such as watching photographs [4]. \nThe ongoing connections established with the deceased would offer solace and aid in the \nassimilation of the loss [5]. Additionally, individuals may engage in internal dialogues, such as \ntalking to the deceased or writing letters [6]. Restoration-oriented coping refers to a set of \nstrategies and behaviors that focus on recovering and rejuvenating oneself in the face of stress \nor adversity, which involves the process of reconstructing the life patterns that have been \ninterrupted due to l oss [7]. This includes practices of self -care, employing distraction methods, \nembracing hope, organizing memorials, and engaging in meaning  reconstruction by \ncomprehending the concept of death [8]. Now, AI technology can enable such coping behaviors \nin the form of interactions with a digital representation of the deceased. \nIn an early case in 2020, virtual reality (VR) technology allowed a mother to meet the simulation \nof her dead child in a virtual environment using a VR headset [9]. In 2023, “grief tech” has become \na rather considerable field among AI applications, with new start-up companies joining the market \nfrom various backgrounds and motives [10]. While many people had the idea of grief -support \nchatbots (griefbots) for a long time, the latest advancements in generative AI like ChatGPT have \npushed such services to a whole new level of capability and accessibility [11]. \nIf the notion of replacing a dead human with a corresponding AI agent still appears too “sci-fi”, we \ncan take a look at the situation of digital pets to bridge the gap in relatability. Virtual pets are \nnothing out of the ordinary from a modern person’s perspective with an average level of digital \nliteracy. Grief toward a dead real pet may make an owner want to temporarily interact with a \nsimilar digital pet to find solace. With the current state of technology, AI-powered digital pets can \nhave increased life -like interactability as well as offer customization options (visual, auditory, \nbehavioral, etc.) so that the user can create an agent that is most similar to the dead pet.  From \nthe perceived normalcy of animal simulation, it is not hard to think that the same desire could lead \nto the possible acceptance of similar practices for human simulation. On the issue of permission \nfor generating such a simulation, there is one interesting point being raised in people’s minds: \none does not need consent from the dead [12]. \nAI character interaction in real-time already exists and is constantly improving \nAs of the end of 2023, the ability to create an AI agent with various human -like expressions has \nbeen improving well. Natural language generation is the core and commonly known feature of \ngenerative AI, based on a large language model (LLM). An AI agent’s human-like characteristics \ncan be customized by providing initial personality settings and background information (e.g. age, \ngender, career, appearance, habits, major life experiences, etc.). The more detailed the input is, \nthe closer to the expected expression the AI will be. Such customization is common when editing \nLLM-based AI agents to create specific simulations of characters. For example, the popular \nplatform character.ai and similar services allow users to create and interact with new and existing \nfictional characters as well as imitations of living or deceased humans (e.g. famous figures in \nhistory). Users of OpenAI’s popular product ChatGPT can now also personally create and \ncustomize their own GPT agents with specific functions and characteristics , even if they do not \npossess coding skills [13]. Depending on the amount of available data about a deceased person, \nan AI agent can reconstruct and imitate their speech content and patterns up to the corresponding \nlevel. The lower delayed time between inputs due to improved processing power and techniques \nhas made real-time interaction between an AI agent and a human possible and closer to face-to-\nface interaction between humans. \nThe voice of a dead person can also be imitated by AI to narrate generated text by the LLM. For \nexample, popular AI voice generators and AI-power text-to-speech services (such as ElevenLabs) \ncan build a quite believable human voice of an individual based on audio samples of that person \nin a relatively short amount of time . Speaking of the voice of the dead,  in 2023, the Beatles \nreleased a new song using the voice of late member John Lennon generated using AI [14]. To \nfurther increase aid the human-like appearance in live interaction (e.g. movements, expressions \nof emotions, etc.), an animated 2 - or 3 -dimensional model of the simulated person can \naccompany the generated text and voice. Examples can be seen in the cases of AI streamers on \npopular platforms such as T witch and YouTube. On the other side, multimodal AI can process \nvisual and auditory information besides text, which makes them able to “ see” and “hear” human \noutputs. Recently, AI also gained the ability t o smell (detect and describe odors) similar to how \nhumans do [15]. In the near future, the application can get one step further by integrating these \n“AI brains” into robotic bodies for physical representation. Combining these abilities to accurately \nimitate human sensory perceptions, an AI agent can further increase its human-like qualities, and \nconsequently improve the persuasiveness in representing the dead person. \nIn brief, modern digital technology can enable a simulated multi-media conversation with a dead \nperson. Regardless of whether it is loss-oriented coping that puts the users with the dead person \nin a past memorial situation or it is restoration-oriented coping that “revives” and reunites the dead \nperson with the user in a postmortem scenario, a grieving person may choose to take this option \nanyway to relieve their emotional pain temporarily. \nAttachment to a representative digital entity \nStrong emotional attachment to non-human entities is not a new concept. Considering this aspect \nin the digital era, such phenomena already existed with earlier technologies and services. For \nexample, users of the companion chatbot service Replika can develop human -like relationships \nwith the chatbots [16]. Some users developed romantic attachment s to their Replika bots and \nwere heartbroken when an update affected the bots’ personalities and interactions that they had \nbeen used to [17]. In these cases, the bots’ identities were almost fictional and the technologies \nwere before or at the start of the recent explosive advancements in LLMs. An AI agent \nrepresenting a real person with a pre -established deep relationship using more advanced \nprocessing capabilities will likely create a much greater degree of emotional attachment upon \ninteraction. \nWhen people have a considerable level of emotional attachment to AI agents representing their \ndead loved ones, they may be more susceptible to emotional impacts resulting from the AI’s \nbehavior, similar to the cases of companion chatbots. For example, cold  or erratic expressions \nfrom the AI agents due to the limitations of LLMs may exacerbate the already complicated \nemotional challenges that grieving individuals are currently facing  [18]. Such susceptibility in \n“intimate” human-AI interactions may also increase the risks related to potential problematic AI \nalignment issues where AI might harm humans during its functioning which has been a topic of \nacademic and public concern recently [19]. On the other hand, AI agents’ succes sful \nrepresentation and impersonation of the decreased might offer a temporary sanctuary for users \nto evade hard feelings and painful events in rea l life, further reinforcing the grieving individuals’ \nattachment to these AI agents. Thus it might cause addiction-like behaviors and psychological \nover-reliance, similar to many other forms of virtual escapism that the new generations are facing \ntoday. \nThe potential growth of cyber-necromancy \nWhen there is a desire, there is demand, and there will be supply. Considering the situations of \nsexual chatbots – LLM-based AI that provides erotic conversations – on the Internet  [20], it is \nclear that such services exist and are used regardless of their undesirable notion in formal \ndiscussions on AI technology. Likewise, AI replacement of dead people will be an available service \nwhen its demand exists. Depending on the extent and content of such services, they may appear \non the open Internet or private networks. It may be worth noting that  compared to sexual desire \nin the case of sexual chatbots, grief can be very strong and accompanied by radicalized emotional \nresponses, which makes i t more likely to bypass ethical concerns in the heat of the moment. A \nperson in actual grief could develop a stronger temptation to utilize AI replacement methods than \nthe expected perception in a normal mental state (hypothetical grief). \nThe trigger to further funding and development of more dedicated AI replacement services for the \ndeceased might start from cases of personal motivation involving people in high positions of social \nor technological power. For example, when leading figures o f big corporations or talented \nengineers lose their loved ones, their initial efforts in this approach will create the path for follow-\nup implementation, proliferation, and normalization  of the notion as well as its applications. \nHowever, at some point, AI replacements of deceased highly popular figures, although likely to \nbe in high demand  by their steadfast supporters , would probably lead to significant social \ncomplications and therefore further facilitate professional as well as public  scrutiny. Then, \ncompromises will likely happen next to balance ethical concerns with market demands, leading \nto formal regulation from the governments and thus limiting cyber-necromancy practices to their \nsocially acceptable forms. Once it becomes a new norm in our digitall y dependent society, \ncognitive dissonance related to personal ethical values on the matter will likely greatly decrease \ndue to the adoption of alternative justified collective values. \nOn the spectrum of possibilities for future development of cyber -necromancy, there are two \nextreme ends. One is that it remains a hypothetical notion for debate yet not practically \nimplemented. The other is that it grows quickly into a new social norm and serves as another \nstepping stone toward digital immortality or complete robotic replacement. Regardless of the \ncurrent speculation, human curiosity, defiance, and emotional attachment are always strong \nforces. Rather than acceptance, some people may desire to defy natural mortality, especially \nwhen the occurrence is viewed as absurd, as a form of gaining control over the greatest unknown \nin one’s mind: death. \n \nAcknowledgment  \nThe authors dedicate this paper to their late friend Liu Tie, who passed away on December 26, \n2023.
