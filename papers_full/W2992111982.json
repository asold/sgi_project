    "abstract": "The remanence (residual flux) in the core of power transformers needs to be determined in advance to eliminate the inrush current during the process of re-energization. In this paper, a novel method is proposed to determine the residual flux based on the relationship between residual flux and the measured magnetizing inductance. The paper shows physical, numerical, and analytical explanations on the phenomenon that the magnetizing inductance decreases with the increase of residual flux under low excitation. Numerical simulations are performed by EMTP (Electro-Magnetic Transient Program) on a 1 kVA power transformer under different amounts of residual flux. The inductance–remanence curves are nearly the same when testing current changes. Laboratory experiments conducted on the same transformer are in line with the numerical simulations. Furthermore, numerical simulation results on a 240 MVA are reported to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",
