In this study, these behaviours were related to \nrelative brain mass in a sample of Australian native birds. Despite suggestive research results so far \nbetween cognition and tool using, this study found no significant difference in relative brain mass or \nin lifespan between tool-using birds and non-tool users. By contrast, in play behaviour, subdivided \ninto social players and non-social players, the results showed statistically very clear differences in \nrelative brain mass between social, non-social and non-players. Social play was associated with both \nthe largest brain mass to body mass ratios and with the longest lifespans. The results show that play \nbehaviour is a crucial variable associated with brain enlargement, not tool using. Since many of the \ntool using species tested so far also play, this study suggests that false conclusions can be drawn about \nthe connection between tool using and cognitive ability when the silent variable (play behaviour) is \nnot taken into account.\nThis paper reports on an investigation of potential associations between relative brain mass and lifespan on one \nhand and two well-known and studied behaviours in birds, those of play behaviour and tool use, on the other. \nAs its data base this paper deals exclusively with Australian native birds as a first overall examination of play \nbehaviour of species native to this continent. In terms of the evolutionary base of modern songbirds and parrots \nthis is of some importance since we know that modern songbirds and cockatoos and possibly other parrots have \ntheir origin in East Gondwana, now called  Australia\n1–3. They either originated in the early Cretaceous period or \nfirst speciated within East Gondwana after the mass extinction event of 65 mya4. Play behaviour, particularly in \nmany species of Australian parrots and cockatoos, is well-known, widespread and was possibly an established \ntrait well before birds radiated to other continents about 30–20 million years ago, in the early  Miocene5. With \na few  exceptions6–9, play behaviour in vertebrates has been far less well-studied in Australia than elsewhere.\nPlay behaviour in animals generally has nonetheless a long history in scientific research. Much excellent \nresearch has been undertaken in the manifestations of play as well as in the neural basis for play—the latter \nlargely in  mammals\n10,11. However, opinions are divided as to answering any of Tinbergen’s four questions about \nultimate causes (adaptive value and evolution) as well as proximate causes (mechanism/causation and develop-\nment) related to play behaviour. This is partly so because play behaviour is not ubiquitous and therefore, as a \nbiological expression of a developing or adult organism, cannot be framed as a universal biological principle. It \nis possible, however, to reveal whether play behaviour is associated with other key biological and social criteria, \nsome of which may belong to the neuro-cognitive  domain\n12. The question emerging is in what way play behaviour \nmay be of some benefit to an organism or enhance its overall fitness.\nAccording to Burghardt’s definition of play  behaviour13, animals from very different phyla, including even \noctopuses, turtles and  cockroaches14, qualify for inclusion in play  behaviour15. Evidence of play behaviour in \nbirds is sprinkled unevenly across a number of avian orders but noticeably more concentrated in the order of \nPsittaciformes (parrots) and among Passeriformes (perching birds). The study here was undertaken to test play \nbehaviour against relative brain mass and longevity in extant native birds whose ancestors never left the Austral-\nian continent.\nAs a comparison to play behaviour the category of tool using behaviour, a well circumscribed behaviour \nwhich at times has been considered a sign of complex  cognition\n16, was also examined in relation to relative brain \nmass and to lifespan.\nPlay behaviour has been described and assessed in different ways and has led to many different hypotheses. \nIronically, the clearest expression of its crucial importance in species that play has been found in cases in which \nOPEN\nSchool of Science and Technology, University of New England, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia. email: gkaplan@\nune.edu.au\n2\nVol:.(1234567890)Scientific Reports |        (2020) 10:20437  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-76572-7\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nopportunities for its expression are absent . Socially and play-deprived rats, for instance, have been shown to \nproduce higher levels of stress hormones and to maintain these elevated levels for longer periods, exposing them \nto the detrimental effects of chronic stress, than do rats in socially and generally enriched  environments17,18. \nHence, it has always been tempting to hypothesise that animals that play are better prepared for adulthood. Play \nbehaviour may have benefits for an  organism\n19, be this in lowering  stress20 or honing skills useful for adult life. \nHoning skills may be  physical21,  perceptual22 or  social23,24. Alternatively, as has been argued, play behaviour may \nhave little or nothing to do with future  skills25–28. As Holekamp and Smale  argued29, young animals should not be \nviewed as merely “imperfect adults with incomplete behavioural repertoires but rather as displaying behaviour \nthat promotes their immediate competence and survival” and indeed, play behaviour is most often observed \nin young  birds\n30. In other words, play behaviour has rather remained an uncomfortable category in which its \npotential functions have never been entirely satisfactorily explained.\nPlay behaviour is not universal. Not all mammals or birds show play behaviour. Worldwide examples of \nplaying birds have been found in just 13 of the 40 orders and all published sources have been identified and \ndocumented in detail by Ortega and  Bekoff\n30: there are published papers on species of the orders of Galliformes \n(grouse, quail), Anseriformes (ducks, geese etc.), Cuculiformes (cuckoos), Charadriiformes (puffins,shorebirds \nand relatives)\n31, Sphenisciformes (penguins), Pelecaniformes (ibis, herons, pelicans etc.), Strigiformes (owls), \nBucerotiformes (hornbills, hoopoes etc.)31, Coraciiformes (kingfishers, bee-eaters etc.) and Falconiformes (fal -\ncons, caracaras). Among the most numerous and diverse number of families and species are the Psittaciformes \n(cockatoos, parrots, lorikeets)33–36 but outnumbering the parrots and all other orders by far are the Passeriformes \n(perching/songbirds)9,34, making up more than half of all extant birds. Diamond and Bond documented all known \npublications exclusively on social play, the most complex form of play and, worldwide, these have so far been \nfound only within three orders (the third are the Bucerotiformes)\n31 an order not occurring in Australia. There is \nsome overlap between Ortega &  Bekoff30and Diamond &  Bond34 references but both sources together provide \na rather complete list of known play behaviour in birds and these references are therefore not reproduced here.\nDefinition of what constitutes play behaviour and tool using. It is generally agreed that there are \nthree distinct categories of play: single (or locomotory) play, object play and social play, and these categorisa-\ntions have continued to be applied as meaningful categories in describing structure, and often context, of play \n behaviour\n30. Play fighting has quite often been treated and discussed separately, largely in small  mammals37,38 \nand  primates20,39. The descriptive play categories have been used for mammals and birds  alike40.\nIn the first category, called solo, solitary or locomotory play, a very wide range of behaviours is included, \nsuch as running, skipping, jumping, ducking, rolling, hanging, swinging, dancing and even sliding and snow-\nromping as has been observed in common  ravens\n41 and in keas, Nestor notabilis42, one of New Zealand’s parrots.\nIn the second category, object play, activities involve objects of any kind ranging from sticks, to stones and to \nsmall household  objects21,43–45. Such object play in birds can lead to social play as a chasing game for the object \nthat the first bird holds in its beak. That is, if such company of others is desired, the bird with the object might \nparade in front of others until they take the bait and join the  game\n46,47. Even solo play can be contagious and get \nother birds to join in by performing the same activity (not necessarily interactively)—particularly noticeable \nin any form of sliding activities, be these performed by ducks using rapids as slides or the well-known snow-\nromping by keas and  ravens\n42,48. Thus, both object and solitary play can turn into communal or social  play34,50.\nThe third category is social play and involves the playing together of any two or more individuals. Such \ninteractions have been documented in far fewer species than solo or object play. Published cases so far tend to \nbe largely limited to  psittacines\n8,35,49 and corvida, such as magpies,  ravens7,9,41,50,51, and very occasional even in \nraptors, such as Montagu’s  harrier52. Social play may include aggressive and play-fighting on the  ground37,38 and \nin the  air9. In muroid  rodents53, targeting for a fight might have grown out of amicable behaviour (e.g., social \ninvestigation, greeting, allo-grooming) rather than, as may be the case in other taxa, from agonistic behaviour \nand thus may have multiple  precursors\n53.\nTool using is known to be present and has been studied in a wider range of species than play  behaviour54. \nSome raptors have become well-known for their tool or proto-tool use, as it has in Lammergeiers, feeding on \nbone-marrow and taking large bones into the sky to drop them on rocky outcrops and thus splintering the bones \nto a size on which the birds can  feed\n55, or in many sea birds and crows dropping shelled invertebrates such as \nclams and shelled  molluscs56–58. True tool use is seen in the black-breasted buzzard, releasing rocks from their \nbeaks to crack emu  eggs59 or the black kite picking up burning ambers and twigs and transporting them to dry \ngrass areas, which promotes the burning of substrate and allows the bird to feast on fleeing or scolded insects \nand  vertebrates\n60. Among the most spectacular and well-documented cases of tool use in psittacines and corvids \nare the New Caledonian crow with its varied tool use and tool manufacture  behaviour61 and the very unusual \nbehaviour of drumming with a stick in palm  cockatoos62,63.\nRationale for this study. Graham and Burghardt (2010) reviewed the field of play  behaviour64 and sug-\ngested to biologists to be bold and to take seriously the challenges that play behaviour provides in terms of \nevolution and general applicability for survival. One can equally argue that it is premature to even consider play \nbehaviour in an overall cognitive framework and speak globally about the phenomenon of play behaviour in \nbirds given that only a miniscule fraction of species of the oriental, neotropical and Australo-Asian and oceanic \nbird regions of the world has been included in any assessment of play behaviour so far, with some very notable \n exceptions\n42,61,62,65,66. In fact, in those aforementioned regions, very few avian species have been studied in any \ndetail in their natural environment for their behavioural repertoires, let alone for play behaviour. Y et these barely \ndiscussed regions, are actually the bird-rich regions of the world and would likely produce a yet almost untapped \nwealth of new material. Even anecdotal but published evidence of play behaviour of wild birds in the Southern \n3\nVol.:(0123456789)Scientific Reports |        (2020) 10:20437  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-76572-7\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nhemisphere is still relatively rare and, with the exception of the parrots of New  Zealand35,42 and some birds in \n Australia9,66 and the very occasional nod in the direction of neotropic, tropical or oriental psittacines, often on \nproblem-solving tasks rather than play  behaviour67–70, what we know of the very playful behaviour of many psit-\ntacine species is often the result of observations of captive birds. Studies of captive birds may provide a glimpse \ninto the potential richness of the field of play behaviour but captivity creates its own rules for survival and some \nobserved behaviours may be artefacts of captivity.\nHowever, as we finally have details of brain weights of Australian psittacines and perching  birds\n71,72 there is \nnow an opportunity to bring play behaviour and tool using together with brain mass and investigate whether \nthere are trends emerging that may covary or even be causally related. It is of particular interest from an evolu-\ntionary point of view. To reiterate: East Gondwana (now Australia) is the cradle of modern  songbirds\n1,2 and some \nidentified extant psittacine species have an evolutionary history going back to the Cretaceous on this  continent3.\nThis study here tests the hypothesis that large-brained birds play more or, vice versa, those that play more \nhave larger brains, a question that has been asked for some  time73,74. This hypothesis has some support in the \nstudy of various mammals showing that brain sizes and life outcomes vary according to individual and social \n conditions\n75–77. It has been shown that play can have a substantial impact on brain size and  learning10 and that \ndomestication, in fact, can modulate rat behaviour of different strains in various ways, such as in play-fighting78.\nIwaniuk et al.73 who linked play behaviour and brain size used three orders—rodents, marsupials and pri-\nmates. They found conflicting evidence for the hypothesis that large-brained species could reliably predict play \nprevalence and complexity. However, their research also showed that orders with, on average, larger brains were \nmore likely to contain species that are more  playful\n73.\nAnother theme to which the Discussion below will refer is the link between length of maturation and the \nincidents of play behaviour and brain  size74, discoveries and suggestions that are now a good two decades old \nbut have so far rarely been followed up in species of the continent (Gondwana/Australia) in which modern pas-\nserines and some psittacines are known to have first evolved.\nThe hypothesis formulated here has built on existing data concerning brain mass, lifespan and play behaviour \non one  hand15,40 and brain mass and tool use on the  other16,54. Stated summarily, it is hypothesised that play \nbehaviour is associated with large brain mass relative to body mass and also with longevity. Since tool using is also \nthought to be associated with large brain size, as shown in well-documented studies of large-brained individual \n species\n79 and both, play behaviour and tool using have been linked with heightened cognition  generally80, in this \nstudy, tool using has been included as an additional parameter.\nResults\nPlay behaviour. Play behaviour and lifespan. First, a comparison was made between the lifespans of \nspecies known to perform play of any kind (N = 35) and lifespans of those species that do not play (N = 42). \nResults revealed that players have significantly longer lifespans than non-players (mean ± sem for play -\ners = 35.21 ± 3.68 years, and for non-players 17.24 ± 1.15 years; 2-tailed T test: t = 5.0138, df = 75, p = 0.0001; see \nFig. 1).\nNext, species that play were separated into those known to perform social play (N = 19) versus those that \nperform only other, non-social play (N  = 16), see Fig.  2. For reasons of sample size, solo and object play were \nput together as one category of ‘non-social’ play. A one-way ANOV A of these groups (social players, non-\nsocial players, non-players) was significant (F \n(2,75) = 30.474, p > 0.00001). Subsequent T-tests showed that the \nassociation between lifespan and play applies only to social playing (mean ± sem of lifespan of social players is \n47.47 ± 5.74 years, and of non-social players it is 19.69 ± 2.71 years: 2-tailed T test, t = 4.1201, df = 33, p = 0.0002; \nFig. 2). There is no significant difference in lifespan between non-social players and the group that performs no \nplay of any kind, non-players (2-tailed T test: t = 0.334, df = 56, p = 0.3304).\nPlay behaviour and relative brain mass. Brain mass relative to body weight  (log10 brain mass/log10 body mass) \nwas compared between the species that performed any type of play (players: N = 35) and the species that do not \nplay (N = 42). For players the mean size of this ratio ± sem was 0.28 ± 0.02 and for non-players it was 0.10 ± 0.03. \nThe difference is significant (2-tailed T test, t = 4.7854, df = 75,t = , p < 0.0001): players had significantly larger \nrelative brain mass compared to non-players (Fig. 3).\nThis effect of play on relative brain mass was examined further by analysing the data for parrots separately \nfrom that of other species. For parrots alone, the ratio of the log brain mass to log body mass was signifi-\ncantly greater in players (mean 0.328 ± 0.020) than in non-players (0.223 ± 0.043) (T = 2.2502, df = 25, 2-tailed \np = 0.0335). Similarly, for the other species (i.e., not parrots) the ratio was higher for players (1.219 ± 0.034) than \nfor non-players (1.085 ± 0.035) (T = 2.1368, df = 49, 2-tailed p = 0.0376).\nThe issue of relative brain size and absolute brain size was raised by Matějů et al.81, who found little support \nfor a link between sociality and relative brain size in an order of mammals but showed that sociality increased \nwith absolute brain size and also with body mass. Based on their result, absolute brain mass and body mass in \nplayers versus non-players in the avian sample were also compared. Although there was no difference between \nthese two groups in body mass (means and sems, players 380.9 ± 38.6 g, and non-players 403.2 ± 128.6 g; 2-tailed \nt test, df = 75, t = 0.1534, p = 0.87), absolute brain mass did differ significantly (players 7.26 ± 0.82 g, non-players \n3.58 ± 0.58 g; 2-tailed t test, df = 75, t = 3.4831, p = 0.0008). Hence, independent of body mass, brain mass is \nlarger in those avian species that play compared to those that do not play and this applies both to parrots (mean \nbrain mass with sem of players is 9.00  ± 1.24 g and for non-players it is 3.72 ± 1.09 g; T = 1.963, df = 25, 2-tailed \np = 0.006) and to species other than parrots (2.47 ± 0.11 g for players compared to 1.98 + 0.12 g for non-players; \nT = 2.327, df = 49, 2-tailed p = 0.024).\n4\nVol:.(1234567890)Scientific Reports |        (2020) 10:20437  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-76572-7\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nAfter separating the players into social players and non-social players, the full data set (i.e. including non-\nplayers) was analysed by one-way ANOV A and found to be significant  (F(2,76) = 13.101, p = 0.000013). Comparison \nof the ratio of the log brain mass to to log body mass ratio of those species that are known to play socially (N = 19) \nversus those known to play but do so only non-socially (N = 16) revealed that this ratio was significantly larger \nfor social players than for non-social players (2-tailed T  test: t = 3.4912, df = 33, p = 0.0014; Fig. 4). Social play \ngoes with having a larger brain to body weight ratio.\nFurthermore, the brain to body weight ratio of non-social players compared to non-players was also signifi-\ncant (2-tailed T test: t = 2.2335, df = 56, p = 0.0295), indicating that non-social playing also increases the mass of \nthe brain relative to body mass but to a lesser degree than does social play.\nFigure 1.

In this sample there was no significant difference between tool users \nand non-tool users in relative brain size. The log of brain mass/log of body mass is 0.198 ± 0.046 (mean ± sem) for \ntool users and 0.174 ± 0.027 for non-tool users (2-tailed T test: t = 0.4712, df = 74, p = 0.6389; Fig. 6).\nDiscussion\nThis study analysed data from 5 to 7 orders of birds indigenous to Australia for play behaviour, as against brain \nmass, lifespan and tool using. A significant association between lifespan and play behaviour (Fig. 1) was found but \nonly for social players and not for non-social players (Fig. 2). It also showed that players had larger brains than \nnon-players (Fig. 3). Surprisingly, even non-social players (solo or object play) were shown to have significantly \nlarger brains than non-players, but not as large as social players. The difference was also significant (Fig. 4).\nSince the strongest evidence of the association of play with large brains was found in species that play socially, \nit required further testing. Social play, as said before, has been identified in Australian species in just two orders, \nalbeit the most numerous, the Psittaciformes and the Passeriformes. To avoid a potential conclusion that this \nFigure 5.  Mean life span in years with standard errors is presented for tool users (N = 26) and non-tool users \n(N = 48). There is no significant difference between these two groups.\nFigure 6.  Tool using compared to brain size. Tool use has no bearing on relative brain mass. Means with \nstandard errors are plotted.\n7\nVol.:(0123456789)Scientific Reports |        (2020) 10:20437  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-76572-7\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nsignificant difference in brain mass between players and non-players in all categories could be biased in favour \nof parrots and cockatoos, known for their extensive play behaviour, the parrots were separated from non-parrots \nand both groups (Psittaciformes and Passeriformes) were analysed separately from the same data set. The results \nshowed that the differences in ratio of the log brain mass to log body mass remained significant for either group, \nstronger in parrots than in songbirds, but nevertheless significant in both orders. In other words, forms of play \nwere associated with a larger brain. The comparisons of lifespan and tool use, however, yielded no significant \nresults at all. Lifespan was comparable whether a species used tools or not (Fig. 5). Even more surprising was the \nfinding that tool using and non-tool using birds showed no differences in relative brain mass (Fig. 6).\nPlay behaviour may thus be a significant factor in juvenile development for large-brained birds while it raises \nquestions about the link between tool using and brain mass. The results here are exciting in that both types of \nengagement in play, be it social or non-social (solo or object) play, were found to have a direct association with \nrelative brain mass. Even non-social players showed greater brain mass than non-players. Most importantly, \nrelative brain mass was much larger in social players compared to brain mass in species that do not engage in \nplay behaviour.\nMost play behaviour occurs during adolescence and, in Australian species, is typically part of a long-drawn \nout maturational process. Indeed, this immature stage post-fledging generally takes up a fifth of the entire lifespan \nof large-brained birds and, as in other large-brained vertebrates, provides an extended period for brain develop-\nment. Importantly, periods to sexual maturity or readiness for establishing a pair relationship and breeding can \nbe delayed by 4–5 years\n82,83 as in white-winged  choughs84, in Australian  magpies9 and even in bowerbirds in \nwhich males have to wait for 7 years before being competitive and some cockatoo species take up to 7 years to \nreach sexual  maturity\n85,86.\nThe protracted development also means that parents have to take an active role of supervision and protection. \nIndeed, more than 60 percent of Australian birds receive a minimum of 50 days of close parental supervision \nand care post-fledging and often much longer, as compared to 18 percent of avian species in high  latitudes\n82,83. \nThis prolonged protection creates the conditions safe enough for self-involved play of youngsters as well as for \nbrain development.\nThe literature is clear about the benefits of play behaviour in terms of stress reduction as measured by levels \nof the stress hormone, be this in mammals (cortisol) or in birds (corticosterone) 87. This is one benefit that is \ninstantaneous and as Pellis and Pellis had argued, is ‘playing for the present’ 75. High levels of corticosterone \nimpede growth, also of the brain, cause cell and plumage damage and ultimately also shorten the  lifespan90,91. \nConversely, lifespan extensions and larger brain mass have been linked to the absence or reduction of stress. In \nbirds, Lendvai et al.\n92 found that those species with larger brains relative to their body size, at any stage in their \nlife history, had a lower baseline and lower peak levels of the stress hormone corticosterone than species with \nsmaller  brains\n92. Hence, reducing or eliminating stress in a juvenile bird by playing could thus have a direct effect \non life expectancy, success in breeding and a number of other life-history events.\nOddly, social play with its thrills and mock risks (as in hide-and-seek, chasing and play-fighting games) \nclearly also creates its own stress. A stimulus that is detected as a physical challenge or is perceived as threatening \nbecomes a stressor when the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis is  activated\n93. In early welfare studies \nin chickens, it was found that fear could be modulated and reduced by providing environmental  enrichment94. \nPlaying, especially play fighting, activates the same neuro-chemical  pathways12,95,96 but then somehow intercepts \nthese pathways. In other words, the individual brain learns to interpret the stressor as harmless and can bring \nstress levels down very swiftly. Learning to control stress levels and reducing levels of corticosterone quickly \nthus becomes a valuable adaptation when facing real risks and dangers. Playing leads to faster reaction time and \noverall stress reduction at the time of playing for which there is ample evidence in  rodents\n95.\nSocial play has so far been found in just three orders of birds worldwide (Psittaciformes, Passeriformes and \nBucerotiformes), as mentioned before, and in just two orders in Australia. Indeed, social players make a much \nsmaller group than that found if all solo and object playing species worldwide are considered. However, this \nstill represents taxonomically up to nine separate families in the Australian sample. One notices that species so \nfar shown to engage in social play behaviour with relative brain masses well above the mean of Australian land \nbirds, either belong to psittacines or to a specific and relatively large cluster of birds that can be described as the \nCorvoidea within the order of Passeriformes, a superfamily to which drongos, fantails, mud-nesters, birds of \nparadise, monarchs, flycatchers , shrikes, Australian magpies and butcherbirds, and all the many species of crows \nand ravens  belong\n40. The species within this super family are thus of special interest in a wider and specifically \nin an evolutionary sense.\nThis study reported here suggests that play behaviour is not at all marginal or a fringe benefit but part of an \nevolutionary development in a specific cluster of birds. As the results have shown, social play is clearly identifiable \nas being associated with overall brain mass and thus it seems to confirm the social brain  hypothesis\n97. Whether \nsocial play is a consequence of the social  brain98,99 or whether social play behaviour is causally related to growing \na larger brain cannot be decided on the basis of these results and will require much further research over a wider \ngroup of species observed and studied in the natural environment.\nThe question keeps being asked what constitutes social complexity and social intelligence in  birds\n100. It seems \nthat play behaviour offers very good and discrete sets of interactions to test specific cognitive abilities and under-\ntake neuroethological studies to test the relationship of brain activity and brain growth, memory and other factors \nagainst play activities. Such studies are still rather sparse even in human children and adolescents. A rare study \nby Peskin and  Ardino\n101 found that playing hide-and-seek is conceptually quite a difficult task: few 3-year-old , \nnot even all 4-year old children are able to play this game successfully, yet juvenile Australian magpies play this \ngame extensively. They also play-fight and play fight in  flight\n9 (Fig. 7).\nAn interesting paper by Smaldino et al. 102 examines how complexity in play behaviour (i.e. in social play) \ninteracts with behavioural variation and socio-cognitive demands. In their mathematical modelling the authors \n8\nVol:.(1234567890)Scientific Reports |        (2020) 10:20437  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-76572-7\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\narrived at the conclusion that the evolution of complex play is favoured when the maximum benefit of complex \nplay is high and when the additional investment needed to manifest that benefit is low. There is a problem, \nhowever: additional investment appears to be particularly high in cockatoos and some passerines in the sense \nthat prolonged/delayed maturation, an environment in which play behaviour can thrive and reach substantial \nsophistication, requires enormous additional investment by the parent birds. Perhaps it can be argued that high \nsurvival rates of offspring and longevity are substantial benefits that still outweigh such investments, a point that \nGonzález‐Lagos et al. conceded a decade  ago\n103. They found that, at least in mammals, there is support for the \nhypothesis that the costs of affording large brains have been counterbalanced with a longer reproductive  life103.\nFinally, the comparison group of tool-using birds showed perhaps the greatest surprise. It seems that within \nthe available sample of native birds no extra brain capacity (or, at least, brain mass) is needed at all in order to use \ntools! Intuitively, this runs counter to expectations. Evidence of tool using behaviour or proto-tool use, at least \nin cockatoos and parrots, in the natural environment is usually restricted to observations of twig manipulations \nand has not been well described other than anecdotally. Palm cockatoo tool use in the wild, as an exception, has \nbeen well-researched. Palm cockatoos may break twigs to the right length to furnish the bottom of the nest hole \nas an inserted platform (to avoid water logging of the nest) and the male uses sticks to drum in territorial and \ncourtship displays and may even carry a favourite stick to other roosting  sites\n63.\nTool use is typically tested in the laboratory, as it has in the Goffin’s cockatoo, also called Tanimbar corellas \n(Cacatua goffiana) at home on the island of Tanimbar north–north west of Australia and part of the Australian \nplate. In captivity, they have been shown to be able to deal with tools and they are very adept at opening com -\nplex locks on par with the performance of  chimpanzees104 and New Caledonian crows as well some cockatoos \nFigure 7.  Four different play contexts. (A) Solo play by little corella (Cacatua sanguinea)-holding on to small \nhanging branch with both feet, the bird swings from side to side as fast and as far as it can, as if on a swing. (B) \nSocial play-wild Australian magpies Gymnorhina tibicen; juveniles at play (identifiable as juveniles by scalloped \ngrey belly feathers) in mutual intimation and ramming attempts conducted close to the ground-can turn into \nvigorous play-fighting. (C) Aerial play fighting/chasing by juvenile magpies: the aim of the pursuer is to get hold \nof a tail feather and destabilise the bird in front. (D) Object play of one little corella turning into play-fighting: \nNote the small dark spot on the left leg of the dominant bird (a desiccated leaf). The other bird had ‘owned’ that \nleaf but the dominant one tried to snatch it and, in that attempt, subdued the original holder of the leaf. Note \nthat the bird lying on its back has clasped the right foot of the bird above, giving it a hold on the dominant bird. \nThey can wrestle by locking on to the opponent’s foot and then roll around for a wrestling match. Often, the \noriginal prize is entirely forgotten and a few seconds or minutes later they feed peacefully next to each other. \n(Credits: A, B, and C by author; D: Bobbi Marchini).\n9\nVol.:(0123456789)Scientific Reports |        (2020) 10:20437  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-76572-7\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\neven manufacture  them61,63,105. In the captive context, Goffin’s cockatoos have indeed performed exceptionally \n well105. There is a problem however. A recent study of the behaviour of wild Goffin’s cockatoos, possibly the first \ncomprehensive study of its kind in this species and undertaken by the same  laboratory106, found no evidence \nof tool use whatsoever in the wild. The birds obviously have little need to engage in this behaviour in the wild \n-they do not use tools in the wild.\nThe authors suggest that the tool-related capacities of Goffin’s cockatoos may “stem from domain general \nprocessing, which, in turn, could represent an adaptation to opportunistic extractive foraging” 106. It has long \nbeen recognised that play behaviour may lead to tool  use107 and that the origins of play behaviour (and indeed of \ncognitive complexity) can be associated with relative complexity of their social groups and/or  environment108,109. \nIn other words, tool use is a potential ability that may be an adaptation to a complex or, as the case may be, very \nrestrictive feeding niche while play behaviour might have an important function in development.\nTool using has been linked with complex cognition or a link has been implied in many studies, from mam-\nmals to birds. The problem lies partly in the modular research approach to behaviour that one distinct type of \nbehaviour is singled out and then tested against relative brain mass. Tool-using has tended to be investigated on \nits own and conclusions have been drawn from displayed scale and complexity of that one specific set of behav-\niour at the exclusion of other possible contributing cognitive candidates that could explain the link to brain size.\nHere it has been shown that, at least in the sample of Australian birds, there is no association between tool-\nusing and relative brain mass. The point here is to propose that those documented outstanding performances in \ntool use and even tool use manipulation and technical know-how in some avian or mammalian species might \nreveal that the species tested with the greatest abilities in tool use may also be shown to have well-established \npatterns of play behaviour. One key methodological problem may lie not in the nature of comparative studies \nbut in the exclusion of ‘silent’ variables such as play behaviour that may substantially distort results obtained for \ntool-using behaviour.\nTo test this assumption, one would need to compare more non-playing/tool-using birds with non-playing/\nnon-tool using birds. I am aware of only one study in which a non-playing tool-using species, the Galápagos \nwoodpecker finch, Camarhynchus pallidus, was compared in its performance with a non-tool-using (nonplaying) \nrelative, the small tree finch, Camarhynchus parvulus\n110, and this has shown that one species did not outperform \nthe other in cognitive tasks.\nThe results here do not underplay the importance and, at times, sophistication of tool using in birds but it \nis a matter of whether these are adaptations or predispositions and what dynamic interaction may be cause or \nconsequence or covariation. It has been argued that different cognitive abilities may belong to ‘different cognitive \nbuilding blocks’\n106. Likewise, specific abilities can be co-opted to serve new  purposes111. Showing no relation-\nship between tool use and relative brain mass as has been the case in this study, however, might well require \nsome further reflection. Innovative behaviour, problem solving and tool using may be indicative of exploratory \nbehaviour indeed and some of it may become very  sophisticated\n112 but this is likely not to be the lynch-pin.\nPlay behaviour, especially social play, ticks all the boxes as an evolutionary driver for brain size increase, \nbringing with it physiological, hormonal and metabolic changes as well as the ability for close social attention \nto others, be these companions, coalitions or opponents in play fights. As Pellis and Pellis argued so eloquently, \ncomplex play including play fighting, involves subtle signals between play partners that are tactical and thus \nsuggest a reliance on cognitive processes “involving attention, cue assessment and perhaps some planning”\n88,89. \nThe counter-argument has been at times that developing a large brain (presumably for increased cognitive func-\ntionality) is biologically very costly but has been counterbalanced by lengthening lifespans and reproduction. It \nis increasingly recognised that the same principle may apply to some avian species.\nRelative brain mass and play behaviour have been shown here to have a consistent and close association, both \nin the wild and in captivity, since different types of play, be this non-social play (solo, object) or social play, are \nreflected in relative brain size, and for social play, even in absolute brain  size\n81.\nRelative brain size as a measure of cognitive abilities is a hotly debated topic about mosaic (in parts) or \nconcerted (whole) evolution of the  brain112,113. We now have evidence that the number of neurons in the avian \nforebrain (pallium) correlates with measurements of  cognition114 and that the brains in large-brained birds so \nfar examined, such as parrots and songbirds, contain on average twice as many neurons as primate brains of the \nsame mass. Moreover, so Olkowicz et al. discovered, corvids and parrots have much higher proportions of brain \nneurons located in the pallial telencephalon compared with primates or other mammals and  birds\n115.\nThe emphasis in this paper, though, has been to examine the link between a number of behavioural variables \nand the dynamics of these variables that might contribute to brain mass and its likely presence of cognitive \nabilities, already in evidence for a number of large-brained birds such as cockatoos and  parrots\n116,  keas117 and \n corvids118. All of the species tested in great detail for their cognitive abilities, one might add, are either extant \nbirds of the southern hemisphere with Gondwanan origins or, as in corvids, have distant Gondwanan heritage.\nAncient Gondwanan lineages of extant modern songbirds show a high level of cooperative  breeding119 and \nof female  song120, two attributes that have almost been lost once species had radiated to other continents. By \ncontrast, play behaviour seems more than merely a superficial social behaviour but a biological adaptation \nfound amongst a wide variety of mammals including humans, with similar outcomes as described here for \nbirds. Another similar evolutionary trait that now seems confirmed is a causal link between large brain size and \n lifespan\n121,122, usually also meaning a slowing down of reproduction and a maturational delay for each genera -\ntion. These findings place the results on play behaviour here into a consistent and important biological pattern \nrather than among incidental and superficial behavioural traits. If this result is sustainable not just at the place \nof origin of modern birds, i.e. East Gondwana, but elsewhere in the world, it is very possible that in the birds \nexamined here, play behaviour is both a mechanism and an outcome a) of their foraging niche, b) of the way they \nare raised and c) an evolutionary progression that has seen those species adapt to coping with vastly changing \nclimate and feeding conditions over the millions of years on the Australian continent.\n10\nVol:.(1234567890)Scientific Reports |        (2020) 10:20437  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-76572-7\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nMethods\nInformation gathering: A data set was assembled that included relative brain sizes (brain mass), lifespan, and \nconfirmation or not of any play behaviour and tool use. A full list of all Australian land-birds with these and other \nmeasures and life history details can be found in the Appendix of Bird Minds\n40 which also includes data of relative \nbrain size of Australian land birds, i.e. of some 500 species, based on Franklin et al.72, used as a basis for the final \nsample size in this study. Franklin et al. data include native, non-vagrant species of the Australian mainland and \nits continental islands and their set comprises data on the brain mass and body mass of 504 species represent -\ning all Australian avian orders (encompassing 74.6% of the Australian avifauna.) and they sampled 96.2% of \nPsittaciformes and 71.1% (224 species) of Australian passerine species. Their brain volume measurements were \nconverted into mass and for the relevant species examined in this paper they had measured brain volume/mass \nfor more than one specimen, arriving at mean brain volumes/mass which are the measures used in this paper.\nThe actual orders, families and species used and referred to in this study are listed below and for each behav-\niour separately. Likewise, tool using behaviour and data for life spans were derived from published accounts (see \nunder source material below).\nSample size. The sample size was originally 145 but almost half had to be discarded because either lifes-\npan or type of play data were not complete or unavailable. Only those species for which lifespan data could be \nobtained were included in the samples that were analysed. This sample included 77 species. The full sample \nwas then subdivided into players (N = 35) versus non-players (N = 42). Of the species that play, it was possible \nto make a subdivision between those that play socially (N = 19) and those that play but not socially (N = 16). A \nsecond subdivision was made on the basis of reliable evidence of tool using (N = 26) versus non-tool using spe-\ncies (N = 48).\nIn summary, species were included of which lifespan data with relevant information exhibiting play and/or \ntool using behaviour and completely logged brain versus body mass data were available. Players included in the \nanalysis belonged to 5 orders and 9 families (see below). The non-players belong to 9 orders and 22 families. \nTool-users included in the analysis belonged to 5 orders and 9 families (see below). The non-tool users belong \nto 9 orders and 22 families. Amongst the players, 34.5% are also tool users and amongst non-players 24% are \nalso tool users. Details of species included in the analysis for both categories of play and tool use are listed below. \nNotably, there would have been plenty of choice to use a wide variety of non-players and non-tool users among \nthe entire range of Australian songbirds. The only constraint has been as to whether lifespan data were available. \nSpecies in which lifespan data were patchy or non-existent were excluded.\nThe data were collated and data points assessed (i.e. relative brain mass versus lifespan, play behaviour or tool \nuse). Tool using was used as a comparison a) because of its concrete delineations of physical interaction with a \ntool and b) because tool using has been associated with innovative behaviour, problem-solving and generally \nwith more complex cognitive abilities (16).\nThe data for three treatment groups (non-players, social players and non-social players) were analysed first by \nusing one-way ANOV As and then by using 2-tailed T test comparisons with Bonferroni correction for multiple \ncomparisons (α = 0.025 for lifespan and  log\n10 brain mass to  log10 body mass comparisons).\nFull bibliographical details of publications on Australian native avian players and tool users are listed below, \ncalled ‘Source material’ .\nBrain data and compilation of behavioural data. The main source for brain and body weight data is Franklin \net al.
