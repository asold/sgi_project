  "abstract": "Although the control of meaningful gestures is one of the most left-lateralized functions, the relative contribution of the two hemispheres to their processing is still debated.

These studies overwhelm-\ningly point to the left hemisphere as the seat of the control\nof gesture. Yet, in the majority of these projects the emphasis\nwas put primarily on manual performance, e.g., the planning\nand subsequent execution of conventionalized hand movements\nbased on verbal commands, or the quality of imitation of the\njust seen meaningful vs. meaningless actions. Therefore, substan-\ntially less is known about the laterality of neural mechanisms\ninvolved in recognition, or even a potentially easier process of\nthe categorization of skilled gestures (cf. Rumiati et al., 2010 ;p p .\n224–225).\nAmong the gestures whose speciﬁc representations have been\nextensively explored and debated are sequential hand movements\nand/or postures frequently used in everyday communication,\nwhich are referred to as intransitive gestures (e.g., waving good-\nbye, beckoning, or hitchhiking), and less frequently used object-\nrelated transitive actions often referred to as tool use pantomimes\n(e.g., simulated use of a hammer, scissors, or a key). Of course,\ncounter to transitive or tool use actions, the former gestures do\nnot require real or imagined objects to convey their meaning.\nYet despite these differences, empirical evidence in favor of inde-\npendent (dissociable) mechanisms for the two types of gestures\nis inconclusive. On the one hand, patients with apraxia have\nbeen found either less impaired during performance of famil-\niar intransitive gestures ( Roy et al., 1991; Foundas et al., 1999;\nHaaland et al., 2000;c f . Mozaz et al., 2002) or not affected at all\nfollowing left hemisphere lesions, despite showing considerable\nimpairments during tool use pantomime ( Rapcsak et al., 1993;\nDumont et al., 1999 ,s e ea l s o Stamenova et al., 2010 ). At ﬁrst\nglance, then, such neuropsychological data suggest that the neu-\nral representations of transitive skills are lateralized more to the\nleft hemisphere. Alternatively, the left hemisphere may support\nwww.frontiersin.org M a y2 0 1 4|V o l u m e5|A r t i c l e4 5 4| 1\n\nHelon and Króliczak Priming and gesture categorization\nindependent mechanisms for transitive and intransitive skills,\nwith a possible extension of the processing of the latter to the\nright hemisphere. On the other hand, recent neuroimaging and\nbehavioral evidence ( Carmo and Rumiati, 2009; Kroliczak and\nFrey, 2009 ;s e ea l s o Mozaz et al., 2009; Króliczak, 2013b )i n d i -\ncates that tool use pantomime and imitation may simply place\nhigher demands on a common representational system mediating\nboth intransitive and transitive manual skills, a system with close\nties to language functions ( Kroliczak et al., 2011 ;f o rar e v i e w ,s e e\nKróliczak, 2013a).\nWhether independent, for example differently lateralized, or\nrather common mechanisms are also involved in the visual\nprocessing (i.e., perception or recognition) of the two gesture cat-\negories is even more inconclusive. The reports from recent func-\ntional neuroimaging studies that d irectly addressed this question\n(Villarreal et al., 2008; Króliczak, 2013b ) indicate that bilateral\nnetworks of areas are engaged during watching of both intransi-\ntive and transitive actions. The most striking difference was such\nthat in the former project a greater involvement for perception of\nintransitive gestures was observe d in a left-hemisphere structure\nlocated within a common network, speciﬁcally in the left infe-\nrior frontal gyrus (which was also engaged by transitive gestures\nbut to a lesser degree). In the latter project, conversely, a greater\nand some bilateral involvement was observed for the perception\nof transitive actions, and only in areas that were outside of the\ncommon network of activation mediating both gesture categories\n(which may, arguably, reﬂect some dissociable mechanisms).\nFurthermore, whereas Villarreal et al. (2008) linked the greater\nleft inferior frontal activity to the recognition of semantic con-\ntent conveyed by their symbolic intransitive gestures, Króliczak\n(2013b) linked the observed increases of activity to the need for\ndeeper visual encoding and more complex visuo-spatial trans-\nformations required for the processing of transitive (tool use)\npantomimes. A preliminary conclusion that can be drawn from\nthese two studies is such that the mechanisms mediating gesture\ncategorization and/or recognition might be organized and/or lat-\neralized somewhat differently from the mechanisms underlying\ntheir skilled performance.\nIn order to shed some new light on the above-mentioned con-\ntroversies and arguments, in this study we tested (1) whether or\nnot the potential differences in the familiarity and/or complex-\nity between intransitive and transitive gestures are also evident in\naccuracy and response times accompanying their categorization,\n( 2 )w h e t h e ro rn o tt h er e p r e s e n t a t i o n so ft h et w og e s t u r ec a t e -\ngories show different sensitivity to lateralized visual and linguistic\ncues, and if there are no clear hints of dissociable mechanisms, (3)\nwhether or not the categorization of meaningful gestures differs\nfrom that of the processing of meaningless actions (that we used\nin this study as a control condition).\nIf intransitive gestures are indeed easier to categorize, this\nshould be reﬂected at least in shorter response times. Moreover,\nif representations of the two gesture categories show different\nsensitivity to visual and semantic cues, and/or they are differ-\nently organized in the brain, we should observe distinct effects\nof such cues on their categorization (e.g., facilitation or inhibi-\ntion of response times), possibly modulated by the side where the\ncues are presented. In particular, whereas congruent cues were\nexpected to facilitate categorization mainly when projected ﬁrst\nto the hemisphere specialized in processing of a particular gesture\ntype, incongruent cues were expected to interfere most when pro-\njected to this same hemisphere, and their inﬂuence could be much\nweaker—but perhaps comparable with congruent cues—when\nreaching the less specialized hemisphere ﬁrst. Finally, we also\nexpected that the pattern of response times for the categorization\nof meaningless hand movements, that have no prior representa-\ntion in the brain, would not resemble the patterns observed for\nmeaningful gestures.\nEXPERIMENTS\nAlthough the order of the two experiments described here—one\nwith pictures, and one with words as primes—was counterbal-\nanced across the whole sample of subjects, for simplicity we will\nnevertheless refer to the use of pictures as Experiment 1, and the\nuse of words as Experiment 2. The two experiments were car-\nried out in Action and Cognition Laboratory in the Institute of\nPsychology at Adam Mickiewicz University in Pozna ´n, Poland.\nParticipants took no longer than 22 min to complete the whole\nstudy. Approved by the local Ethics Committee, this research was\nperformed in accordance with principles of the Helsinki 1964\nDeclaration.\nSeventeen volunteers partook in this research after giving\ntheir informed consent. The results from two participants (two\nwomen) were excluded from further analyses because of low accu-\nracy (56.1%, with the average accuracy of 82% and SD = 8.5i n\nboth studies) or the low number of the recorded responses (2%)\ndue to an equipment malfunction.\nEXPERIMENT 1: CATEGORIZATION OF GESTURES PRIMED BY PICTURES\nMethods\nAll 15 healthy volunteers (eight women, mean age = 23.0; SD =\n1.5) who contributed to this research had normal or corrected-to-\nnormal visual acuity, and were native speakers of Polish. Although\nhandedness was not measured with a questionnaire, before the\nstudy participants explicitly declared which hand they typically\nuse in daily activities such as writing, throwing, and using a\nspoon. The vast majority of subjects (13) were right-handed. (The\nRT patterns of two left-handed individuals were indistinguishable\nfrom those of right-handers, most likely because similarly to the\nmajority of left-handers they had praxis and language typically\nlateralized; see Kroliczak et al., 2011 ).\nBefore the experiment proper, subjects participated in a short\npre-training phase composed of trials containing two movies\nfrom each of the to-be-tested category. Although the trial struc-\nture was the same, the videos used were recorded on a different\noccasion with a different background. It was during this intro-\nduction to the study that participants were asked for the ﬁrst time\nto ﬁxate the cross in the middle of the screen throughout the\nstudy. As conﬁrmed by the experimenter, they were indeed able to\nmaintain ﬁxation when the priming pictures were shown, which\nis critical for this paradigm.\nParticipants were seated 57 cm in front of the computer mon-\nitor, which subtended the visual angle of 30 × 18.5\n◦.T h i r t ys i x\ncentrally presented short videos showing gestures performed by\nan actor were used as target stimuli. Only the right arm and hand,\nFrontiers in Psychology| Cognition M a y2 0 1 4|V o l u m e5|A r t i c l e4 5 4| 2\nHelon and Króliczak Priming and gesture categorization\nchest and the right upper leg were visible on the screen, whereas\nthe face and most of the left side of the body remained outside\nof the frame. The recorded movements belonged to three cate-\ngories: intransitive (“conversational”), transitive (simulated tool\nuse) gestures, and meaningless hand movements, with 12 videos\nin each category. The list of all 24 meaningful gestures can be\nfound in the Appendix. The movies were recorded with BENQ\nDC C1060 camera located 1.6 meters in front of the actor.\nIn Experiment 1, the to-be-categorized hand movements\nshown in the videos were primed by: (1) pictures of hands in pos-\ntures that were most characteristic for intransitive gestures used\nin this study, (2) pictures of tools whose usage was pantomimed\nin the clips, or (3) by meaningless pictures (obtained with a\npolar-coordinate ﬁlter distorting the images from the intransitive\nand transitive categories to make them unrecognizable; e.g., in\nPhotoshop: go to Filter, choose Distort, then Polar Coordinates,\nthen Rectangular to Polar. For many objects the function had to\nbe used at least twice to make them beyond recognition.). Due to\ndifferences in typical orientations of hand postures and objects,\nand/or sizes of objects, the pictures projected either 4 × 4o r\n3 × 3.5\n◦ of visual angle (with the different sizes of priming stimuli\ndistributed equally across the three categories of trials, and their\ncenter of gravity kept in the same spot). The stimuli were shown\non a gray background (RGB 250/250/250), and were preceded by\na ﬁxation point, i.e., a black cross in the middle of the screen.\nThe trial structure was as follows: the ﬁxation cross alone was\nshown for a variable interval of 1000, 1500, or 2000 ms (thus\nintroducing some uncertainty about the timing of the following\nevents). Then, a prime stimulus appeared for 150 ms either on\nthe left or right side of the screen (ca. 7\n◦ of visual angle from\nthe ﬁxation point), and was immediately masked for 50 ms with a\ncheckerboard pattern, which always subtended the visual angle of\n4 × 4◦. (All the volunteers were explicitly instructed to maintain\nﬁxation on a central cross even if there is an additional stimu-\nlus brieﬂy shown to the right or left of the cross.) Subsequently\na movie was presented and it remained on the screen until a\nresponse was provided or for up to 4 s. Participants were asked for\ncategorization of the watched gestures as representing: “conver-\nsation” (intransitive), “tool” (transitive), or “nonsense” (mean-\ningless gesture). If the answer was not given (by pushing an\nappropriate button), the next trial started 1 s after the end of the\nvideo. The trial structure is depicted in Figure 1.\nThe target videos were preceded either by congruent or incon-\ngruent primes. In the former case, the prime belonged to the same\ncategory as the video (e.g., the characteristic hitch-hiking hand\nposture preceded the hitch-hiking gesture, a picture of a hammer\npreceded a movie showing a pounding gesture, or an unrecog-\nnizable image preceded a meaningless movement). In the case of\nincongruent primes, the stimuli belonged to a category different\nfrom the main stimulus (e.g., a picture of a hammer shown before\nthe hitch-hiking or a meaningless gesture). Each movie appeared\no n l yt h r e et i m e sd u r i n gt h ec o u r s eo fag i v e ne x p e r i m e n t ,a n d\nit was preceded by a prime belonging to each category. For that\nreason, half of the randomly selected movies in a given category\nwere preceded by congruent primes on the left, and the remaining\nhalf by congruent primes on the right. In the case of incongru-\nent primes—which now belonged to two different categories—for\nhalf of the randomly selected movies all the randomly assigned\nincongruent primes appeared on the left, and for the remaining\nhalf of the movies all the assigned primes appeared on the right.\nB yd o i n gt h i sw em a d es u r et h a tp r i m el o c a t i o nw a sa l s op r o p -\nerly counterbalanced in each participant (not for each movie, but\ndeﬁnitely for the whole category of movies). The order of trials\nwas randomized differently for each participant and it was divided\ninto three blocks, 36 trials each. There was an optional break after\nblock one, and a compulsory break (lasting at least 1 min) after\nblock two.\nThe design was implemented in SuperLab ver. 4.5.2 (Cedrus®,\nSan Pedro, CA), and carried out with the use of Dell Latitude\nD620 PC. “RB-530” response pad by Cedrus was used for mea-\nsuring accuracy and response times. The patterns of responses\nwere counterbalanced across hands and gesture types. Namely,\nwhen the left button of the pad was pressed with the left-hand ﬁn-\ngers for intransitive gestures, the button on the right was pressed\nwith the right-hand ﬁngers for transitive gestures, and vice versa.\nFor meaningless gestures partic ipants always pressed the middle\nbutton with either their right- or left-hand ﬁngers.\nAll the collected data were analyzed with two separate\nrepeated-measures Analyses of Variance (ANOVAs), one for accu-\nracy and one for response times to correctly categorized gestures.\nThe within-subject factors were gesture (intransitive, transitive,\nmeaningless), prime location (left, right), and prime type (congru-\nent, incongruent). The adopted level of signiﬁcance was p < 0.05.\nIf necessary, the required post-hoc tests were Bonferroni corrected\n(marked as Bf-p). For reaction times accompanying a correct\ncategorization of movies, outliers greater than two standard devi-\nations above or below the mean (calculated across conditions, less\nthan 1% of all trials) were removed.\nResults\nRecognition accuracy. Because none of the differences between\nthe categorization accuracy for intransitive and transitive gestures\nwas signiﬁcant (neither in the main effects nor the interactions,\noften even without the necessary Bonferroni correction), these\ndata will not be discussed at length here. Except for the main\neffect of gesture [ F\n(2, 28) = 8.1, p < 0.01; Partial Eta Squared\n(pη2) = 0.37; observed power (alpha) = 0.94] such that both\nintransitive and transitive gestures were categorized with sig-\nniﬁcantly greater accuracy than meaningless hand movements\n(Bf-p < 0.01, and Bf- p < 0.05, respectively), all the remaining\nsigniﬁcant main effects and interactions were driven by differ-\nences in the categorization of meaningless actions. (These are\nof no particular interest in the absence of signiﬁcant differences\nbetween the two meaningful gesture categories.) The average cat-\negorization accuracy for intransitive gestures was 83% ( SE =\n2%), for transitive gestures it was 85% ( SE = 2.8%), and for\nmeaningless hand movements it was only 73% ( SE = 1.7%).\nResponse Times (RTs) for correctly categorized gestures.There\nwas a main effect of gesture [F\n(2, 28) = 96.6, p < 0.001; pη2 =\n0.87; alpha = 1.0] such that intransitive gestures were cate-\ngorized signiﬁcantly faster than the other two types of hand\nmovements (mean RT for intransitive = 1479 ms, SE = 40 ms;\ntransitive = 1906 ms, SE = 50 ms; and meaningless = 1867 ms,\nwww.frontiersin.org M a y2 0 1 4|V o l u m e5|A r t i c l e4 5 4| 3\nHelon and Króliczak Priming and gesture categorization\nFIGURE 1 | T rial structure and timing.In (A) the priming stimulus was a\ncharacteristic hand posture, in(B) it was a picture of a tool, and in(C) an image\nof a distorted, unrecognizable object. After a ﬁxation point presented on a\nblank screen for a variable time interval (1000, 1500, or 2000 ms), the priming\nstimulus was shown either on the left or right (as shown by a grayed inset)\nfor 150 ms, followed by a 50-ms mask, and a centrally presented gesture.\nThe movie stayed on the screen until a participant responded or for up to 4 s.\nAdditional 1-s delay interval was introduced after a movie disappeared.\nSE = 63 ms; Bf- p < 0.001 in both cases). No signiﬁcant differ-\nence was observed between transitive and meaningless gestures\n(uncorrected p = 0.8). This effect is shown in Figure 2.T h e r ew a s\nalso a main effect of prime type [F(1, 14) = 16.1, p < 0.001; pη2 =\n0.53; alpha = 0.96] such that movies preceded by a congruent\nprime were categorized signiﬁcantly faster than on incongru-\nent trials (mean RT for congruent = 1727 ms, SE = 49 ms vs.\nincongruent = 1775 ms, SE = 47 ms). The effect of prime loca-\ntion was not signiﬁcant [ F\n(1, 14) = 0.23, p = 0.6; pη2 = 0.02;\nalpha = 0.07].\nImportantly, there was a signiﬁcant interaction between ges-\nture and prime location [F(2, 28) = 37.8, p < 0.001; pη2 = 0.73;\nalpha = 1.0], such that intransitive and transitive gestures were\ncategorized signiﬁcantly faster when they were primed by a stim-\nulus in the right visual half ﬁeld (VHF), as compared to the left\nVHF (Bf-p < 0.01 and Bf- p < 0.001, respectively). For meaning-\nless gestures the effect was reversed (Bf- p < 0.001). There was\nalso a signiﬁcant interaction between prime location and prime\ntype [F\n(1, 14) = 7.5, p < 0.01; pη2 = 0.35; alpha = 0.72], but\nthe effect of congruent primes leading to faster categorization\nonly when they were presented in the right VHF turned out to\nbe insigniﬁcant after the Bonferroni correction (Bf- p = 0.06).\nLeft-sided priming had an even weaker effect in this interac-\ntion (uncorrected p = 0.07). Nevertheless, all these results should\nbe interpreted with caution because there was also a very intu-\nitive and signiﬁcant three-way interaction [between gesture, prime\nside,a n d prime type ; F\n(2, 28) = 5.3, p < 0.01; pη2 = 0.28; alpha\n= 0.80].

A signiﬁcant facilitation of response times by congruent\nright VHF primes was observed for transitive gestures (Bf- p <\n0.001), but not for incongruent primes (uncorrected p = 0.44).\nA completely reversed effect of primes, i.e., response facilitation\nwhen they were presented in the left VHF, and more importantly,\nregardless of their congruency, was observed for meaningless ges-\ntures (Bf- p < 0.01, and Bf- p < 0.001, respectively, on congruent\nand incongruent trials). These effects are shown in Figure 3.T h e\nmean response times, as well as mean accuracy data, for all the\nconditions are listed in Ta b l e 1.\nDiscussion of Experiment 1\nIntransitive (“ conversational,” non-object related) gestures were\ncategorized signiﬁcantly faster than transitive (simulated tool use)\ngestures and meaningless hand movements, whose categoriza-\ntion efﬁcacy—in terms of response times—did not differ between\neach other. Such an outcome is consistent with an earlier obser-\nvation that, at least under time pressure, healthy individuals also\nperform poorer during imitation of transitive actions, irrespec-\ntive of whether they are meaningful or meaningless ( Carmo and\nRumiati, 2009 ). Slower performance with transitive, as well as\nslower and poorer categorization of meaningless gestures in our\nstudy, is therefore consistent with an idea that tool use pan-\ntomimes and nonsense hand movements, perhaps mainly due to\ngreater movement complexity, are harder to process than more\nfamiliar intransitive gestures ( Vingerhoets, 2008; Kroliczak and\nFrey, 2009; Króliczak, 2013b ;s e ea l s o Johnson-Frey et al., 2005\nand Villarreal et al., 2008 , where meaningless hand movements\nwere used in a control condition). It must be emphasized, though,\nthat the pattern of response times for correctly categorized ges-\ntures observed in our study is exactly the opposite of what was\nfound in an fMRI report by Villarreal et al. (2008) , where both the\nFIGURE 3 | Response times to correctly categorized intransitive\ngestures, tool use pantomimes, and meaningless hand movements\nprimed by congruent or incongruent pictorial cues presented in the right\nor left visual ﬁeld.Transitive gestures were greatly facilitated by congruent\npictorial cues on the right, and intransitive gestures showed a similar trend.\nThe effect for meaningless movements was reversed.

Yet, the\ntesting paradigm they used was substantially different from ours.\nOne can speculate that the categorization of such well-known\ngestures as “ waving hello ”o r“ hitchhiking”m a yb er a t h e ra u t o -\nmatic and less dependent on “contextual” pictorial cues, in con-\ntrast to meaningless movements, or even tool use gestures, which\ncan be more difﬁcult to decipher when seen unexpectedly. This\nhypothesis, combined with the issue of laterality of their repre-\nsentations (or processing) was tackled by analyzing the effects of\nprime side and prime type . Although the processing of transitive\n(tool use) gestures was slower, and comparable to meaningless\nmovements, their categorization proﬁted most from congruent\npictures presented brieﬂy on the right. Such an effect could either\nindicate that this gesture category is most strongly left lateral-\nized or that it is particularly sensitive to relevant pictorial cues\nwhen they are processed in the left hemisphere. (Of course, this\neffect could also indicate a combination of both left-sided rep-\nresentations of tool use skills and t heir particular responsiveness\nto pictorial cues). The most efﬁciently categorized intransitive\ngestures, on the other hand, were not facilitated as much by\ncongruent pictures on the right. This could be due to (1) a\nﬂoor effect, such that one cannot simply get much faster with\ntheir categorization; (2) the fact that even the most character-\nistic hand postures depicted in the priming stimuli are more\ndifﬁcult to process than pictures of tools (which do a very good\njob of priming the categorization of transitive gestures), or (3)\nweaker laterality of representations mediating intransitive skills\n(e.g., Rapcsak et al., 1993; Dumont et al., 1999 ). Indeed, the idea\nthat intransitive and transitive skills might be mediated by dif-\nferent mechanisms—with intransitive gestures being supported\nmore strongly by the right hemisphere, or more bilaterally, i.e.,\nby both hemispheres—ﬁgures rather prominently in most inﬂu-\nential theories of praxis and inspires research and discussions on\nrepresentations of praxis skills up until today (e.g., Rothi et al.,\n1991; Cubelli et al., 2000; Buxbaum, 2001; Króliczak, 2013b ;s e e\nalso Binkofski and Buxbaum, 2013 ).\nIncidentally, neither the categorization of intransitive nor tran-\nsitive gestures was inﬂuenced by incongruent primes, irrespective\nof their presentation side. Conversely, response times accompa-\nnying correct decisions on meaningless hand movements were\nfacilitated by priming stimuli on the left, whether congruent or\nincongruent. Because postulating their explicit representations in\none of the two hemispheres does not make much sense, it stands\nto reason that the categorization of such unskilled actions (i.e.,\nmovements which are not in a repertoire of our manual skills)\nmay depend more on visuo-spatial abilities, and more deliber-\nate processing, often associated with the right cerebral cortex\n(e.g., Kroliczak et al., 2007 ;c f . Kroliczak et al., 2008 ;s e ea l s o\nWhitehouse and Bishop, 2009; Rossit et al., 2011 ). For these\ntwo reasons alone, the categorization of meaningless movements\nwould be less affected by the meaning of the priming cues. In\nshort, the observed response facilitation might be due to an\nengagement of related right hemisphere processing before the\nmeaningless action is encountered.\nThe results so far are consistent with a long-standing idea\nthat tool use skills are represented in the left hemisphere (see\nalso Vingerhoets et al., 2009; Verma and Brysbaert, 2011; Garcea\net al., 2012; Vingerhoets et al., 2012 ), whereas meaningless actions\nmight be primarily or preferentially processed in the right hemi-\nsphere. (This is probably one of the reasons why meaningless\nactions make a good control condition in fMRI projects on ges-\ntures.) The status of intransitive or “communicative” gestures is\nless obvious because either they have more bilateral representa-\ntions or are simply less dependent on the context in which they\nare encountered. The latter two ideas can be explored by chang-\ning the primes from pictorial to linguistic cues, and this is exactly\nwhat has been done in Experiment 2.\nIf intransitive gestures are represented more bilaterally, there\nshould be no substantial facilitation from priming of these actions\nby closely related verbal cues presented in the right visual ﬁeld\n(i.e., processed immediately by the left hemisphere). Moreover,\none could even observe a signiﬁcant interference in the form of\nslowing down of their categorization by incongruent words pre-\nsented in the left visual ﬁeld (i.e., engaging initially the right\nhemisphere).\nEXPERIMENT 2: CATEGORIZATION OF GESTURES PRIMED BY WORDS\nMethods\nThese same 15 healthy volunteers [eight women, mean age = 23.0\n(SD = 1.5) years of age] were involved in this study. The methods\nused were very similar to Experiment 1, except for the primes.\nNamely, the videos were now preceded by brieﬂy presented\n(150-ms) linguistic cues, i.e., single words or brief two-word\nexpressions most often associated with intransitive and transitive\ngestures (including their names, and object names), or mean-\ningless strings of letters. Again, the priming stimuli were either\ncongruent (i.e., belonged to the same category) or incongruent\nFrontiers in Psychology| Cognition M a y2 0 1 4|V o l u m e5|A r t i c l e4 5 4| 6\nHelon and Króliczak Priming and gesture categorization\nwith the target gesture (i.e., represented the other two categories).\nAll these primes were also immediately masked (for 50 ms) with\na string of nine hashes (### ... ) which exceeded the longest of the\npriming cues by one symbol. The font size used both for words\nand non-words was 26 pt, whereas that for the mask was 28 pt.\nThus, given that our priming cues consisted of 2–8 characters,\nthey subtended the visual angle from 0.7 to 3\n◦.T h es t i m u l io f\nvarious sizes were distributed more or less equally across all the\nconditions.\nThe relevant words or expressions related to meaningful ges-\ntures that were shown in the videos were chosen from the most\nfrequent responses provided before the study by ﬁve student vol-\nunteers (two women) who did not participate, and were not\ninvolved in any way, in this research project.\nSimilarly to Experiment 1, the collected data were analyzed\nwith two separate repeated-measures ANOVAs, for accuracy and\nfor response times to correctly categorized gestures. Again, the\nwithin-subject factors were gesture (intransitive, transitive, mean-\ningless), prime location (left, right), and prime type (congruent,\nincongruent). The adopted level of signiﬁcance was p < 0.05 and,\nif necessary, post-hoc tests were Bonferroni corrected (Bf-p). For\nRTs to correctly categorized movies, outliers greater than two\nstandard deviations above or below the mean were removed (less\nthan 1% of all trials).\nResults\nRecognition accuracy. Similarly to Experiment 1, there was\nam a i ne f f e c to fg e s t u r e[ F(2, 28) = 4.8, p < 0.05; pη2 = 0.25;\nalpha = 0.75] but now it was such that only intransitive ges-\ntures were categorized with signiﬁcantly greater accuracy than\nmeaningless hand movements (Bf- p < 0.05), whereas the differ-\nence between transitive and meaningless actions did not reach\nsigniﬁcance level (Bf- p = 0.2). Intransitive and transitive ges-\nture categorization was comparable (Bf- p = 1.0). There was also\na counterintuitive main effect of prime location [F\n(1, 14) = 10.0,\np < 0.01; pη2 = 0.42; alpha = 0.84], such that gestures primed by\na word in the left visual ﬁeld were categorized with greater accu-\nracy than gestures primed by a word in the right visual ﬁeld, and\nthis effect mirrors the one observed for RTs (see below). Although\nthere was also a signiﬁcant interaction between gesture and prime\ntype [F\n(2, 28) = 7.6, p < 0.01; pη2 = 0.35; alpha = 0.92], none\nof the differences between categorization accuracy for any ges-\ntures was signiﬁcant when Bonferroni correction was applied.\nThere were no other signiﬁcant effects. The average categoriza-\ntion accuracy for intransitive gestures was 87% ( SE = 1.9%), for\ntransitive gestures it was 85% ( SE = 2.5%), and for meaningless\nhand movements it was only 76% ( SE = 3.1%).\nRTs for correctly categorized gestures.There was a main effect\nof gesture [F(2, 28) = 133.0, p < 0.001; pη2 = 0.91; alpha =\n1.0] such that similarly to Exper iment 1 intransitive gestures\nwere again categorized signiﬁcantly faster (mean RT = 1453 ms,\nSE = 42 ms) than transitive gestures (mean RT = 1985 ms, SE =\n47 ms; Bf- p < 0.001) and meaningless hand movements (mean\nRT = 1854 ms, SE = 49 ms; Bf- p < 0.001). Importantly, counter\nto Experiment 1, transitive gestures were categorized signiﬁcantly\nslower than meaningless movements (Bf- p < 0.05). This effect is\nshown in Figure 4. In sharp contrast to Experiment 1, a main\neffect of prime location was now signiﬁcant [ F(1, 14) = 27.6, p <\n0.001; pη2 = 0.66; alpha = 0.99], but it was also quite unexpected,\nsuch that the studied gestures were categorized signiﬁcantly faster\nwhen the priming stimuli were presented in the left VHF (mean\nRT = 1736 ms, SE = 41 ms) as compared to the right VHF (mean\nRT = 1793 ms, SE = 43 ms). Finally, there was also a counterin-\ntuitive main effect of prime type [F(1, 14) = 6.3, p < 0.05; pη2 =\n0.31; alpha = 0.64] with gesture categorization being signiﬁcantly\nfaster following incongruent primes (mean RT = 1743 ms, SE =\n44 ms) as compared to congruent primes (mean RT = 1785 ms,\nSE = 40 ms). The latter two main effects should not be overrated,\nthough, given the signiﬁcant interactions that were also obtained.\nThe ﬁrst signiﬁcant interaction was between gesture and prime\nlocation [F(2, 28) = 18.6, p < 0.001; pη2 = 0.57; alpha = 1.0].\nThis effect was such that intransitive gestures were categorized\nsigniﬁcantly faster following priming words on the right (Bf- p <\n0.01), whereas transitive gestures were categorized signiﬁcantly\nfaster following priming words on the left (Bf- p < 0.001). The\neffect of prime location for meaningless hand movements was\nsimilar to transitive gestures but turned out to be insigniﬁcant\nafter Bonferroni correction (uncorrected p = 0.04). There was\nalso a signiﬁcant interaction between prime location and prime\ntype [F\n(1, 14) = 12.9, p < 0.01; pη2 = 0.48; alpha = 0.92]. This\ninteraction, on the other hand, suggested that gesture categoriza-\ntion was signiﬁcantly slower when the right-sided priming words\nwere actually congruent (Bf- p < 0.01), whereas the left-sided\nwords had no effect whatsoever (uncorrected p = 0.37). As in\nFIGURE 4 | The main effect of gesture for correctly categorized movies\nwhen words were used as primes.Intransitive gestures were again\ncategorized signiﬁcantly faster than transitive and meaningless\nmovements.

Similarly to Experiment 1, tests\nof simple main effects were utilized to clarify the apparently com-\nplex relationships between these factors. The tests revealed that\nintransitive gestures were categorized signiﬁcantly faster when\nprimed by congruent words on the right (as compared to congru-\nent words on the left; Bf- p < 0.001), whereas their categorization\nwas signiﬁcantly slower when primed by incongruent words on\nthe right (as compared to incongruent words on the left; Bf- p <\n0.001). In sharp contrast, for both transitive gestures and mean-\ningless hand movements the effect of prime type was reversed\nbecause their categorization was signiﬁcantly slower when con-\ngruent cues appeared on the right (as compared to congruent\ncues on the left; Bf- p < 0.001 in both cases), whereas there was\nno impact of incongruent priming words on their categorization\nthat could be related to the presentation side (uncorrected p =\n0.19 for transitive, and p = 0.09 for nonsense movements). These\neffects are shown in Figure 5. The mean response times, as well as\nmean accuracy data, for all the conditions from Experiment 2 are\nlisted in Ta b l e 2.\nFinally, for clariﬁcation of the obtained interaction effects, two\nadditional post-hoc tests are described here to compare response\ntimes accompanying correct categorization of intransitive ges-\ntures following incongruent linguistic cues on the left with the\neffects of congruent cues on the right, and the impact of con-\ngruent cues on the left. Both of the observed differences were\nsigniﬁcant (Bf- p < 0.001 in both cases). Namely, although the\ncategorization of intransitive gestures following incongruent cues\non the left was signiﬁcantly slower as compared to the effects of\ncongruent cues on the right, it was at the same time signiﬁcantly\nfaster when compared to the effects of congruent cues on the left.\nThis effect is shown in Figure 6.I no t h e rw o r d s ,f o rt h ec a t e g o -\nrization of intransitive gestures, taking into account a valid cue\nfrom the left visual ﬁeld requires signiﬁcantly more time than a\nrejection of an invalid cue.

Asterisks\nindicate differences with Bonferroni-correctedp-values of at least 0.001 (∗∗∗).\nbeen described in the previous paragraph, with an emphasis on\nthe effect that incongruent cues on the right slowed participants’\nresponses.)\nDiscussion of Experiment 2\nBecause for categorization accuracy none of the differences\nbetween intransitive and transitive gestures was signiﬁcant, in the\ndiscussion we will again focus on ly on response time results. It\nshould be noted, though, that comparable accuracy in the two\nconditions indicates that both of the meaningful gesture cate-\ngories have ﬁne-grained representations in the brain, and the\nretrieval of these representations cannot be easily interfered with.\nIn healthy participants, the differences in access and/or interfer-\nence effects are only or primarily apparent when response times\nare analyzed, although in patients differences in accuracy follow-\ning left- or right-sided lesions are often quite clear ( Roy et al.,\n1991; Foundas et al., 1999; Haaland et al., 2000 ;c f . Rapcsak et al.,\n1993; Dumont et al., 1999; Mozaz et al., 2002 ,s e ea l s oStamenova\net al., 2010 ).\nSimilarly to Experiment 1, intransitive (“conversational”) ges-\ntures were again categorized signiﬁcantly faster than transitive\n(tool use) pantomimes and meaningless hand movements. Yet,\nthis time the categorization efﬁcacy also differed between the\nlatter two, with correct responses to transitive gestures being sig-\nniﬁcantly slower than to meaningless actions. As noted above, the\nbetter performance with intransitive gestures is quite consistent\nwith an earlier report on differences in accuracy observed dur-\ning imitation of the two gesture categories under time constraints\n(Carmo and Rumiati, 2009 ). Indeed, these and our current\nresults, as well as the outcomes of other behavioral (e.g., Mozaz\net al., 2009 ) and recent neuroimaging studies on intransitive\nand transitive gestures support a view that transitive actions, as\nbelonging to a less familiar category, rather than being differ-\nently represented—i.e., more left lateralized—are more difﬁcult\nto process and/or perform [ Kroliczak and Frey, 2009; Króliczak,\n2013b; but cf. behavioral and neuroimaging results of Villarreal\net al. (2008) ;s e ea l s oStamenova et al., 2010 ]. Interestingly, in the\ncontext of Experiment 2, this can be also said when their catego-\nrization is compared with that of actions deprived of meaning.\nNamely, meaningless actions were also categorized with greater\nease than transitive gestures. Alt hough meaningless actions were\nalso categorized with lowest accuracy, speed-accuracy trade-off\ncannot be the major factor involved and its effect must have been\ncombined with a greater adverse impact of linguistic cues on the\ncategorization of transitive gestures.\nAs to the impact of these laterally presented cues in the form\nof words or short phrases on categorization, all the three gesture\ntypes were affected by congruent primes presented on the right.\nYet it was only the categorization of intransitive gestures which—\ncounter to a hypothesis of their more bilateral representations—\nwas greatly facilitated, whereas the processing of transitive and\nmeaningless actions was substantially hindered (as compared to\nthe left-sided cues of the same ki nd). Conversely, the impact of\nincongruent linguistic cues was observed only for the intransi-\ntive gesture category, and it was actually the opposite of what\nwas found for congruent primes. Namely, whereas right-sided\ncongruent linguistic cues have facilitated performance, incongru-\nent primes presented on the right have now slowed down the\ncategorization of intransitive gestures.\nEven though the latter ﬁnding is consistent with a view that\nthe representations of intransitive gestures—similarly to language\nskills, with which they must be closely related ( Kroliczak et al.,\n2011)—are strongly left lateralized, this interpretation should be\nexercised with caution. After all, although the veriﬁcation of an\nincongruent linguistic cue from the left visual ﬁeld, i.e., processed\nﬁrst in the right hemisphere, takes signiﬁcantly longer than the\nevaluation of a congruent cue in the left hemisphere, neverthe-\nless, and quite surprisingly such ve riﬁcation takes signiﬁcantly less\ntime than the processing of a congruent cue in the right hemi-\nsphere. This is not what would be expected if the representations\nof intransitive gestures were exclusively left lateralized.\nThe above-mentioned counterintuitive sensitivity to right\nhemisphere processing further suggests that intransitive ges-\ntures are represented somewhat differently from transitive pan-\ntomimes. The latter, conversely to intransitive but similarly to\nmeaningless movements, were adversely affected by congruent\nlinguistic cues presented on the right (i.e., projected to the left\nhemisphere). This could be due to the fact that some of its\nprocessing is either incompatible with, or perhaps engages exces-\nsively, the mechanisms to be also involved in their categorization.\nA different kind of representation for tool use gestures is also\nsuggested by the lack of sensitivity to irrelevant linguistic cues (cf.\nKroliczak et al., 2006 ), irrespective of the presentation side.\nwww.frontiersin.org M a y2 0 1 4|V o l u m e5|A r t i c l e4 5 4| 9\nHelon and Króliczak Priming and gesture categorization\nGENERAL COMMENTS\nConsistently with earlier reports ( Carmo and Rumiati, 2009;\nKroliczak and Frey, 2009; Króliczak, 2013b ), this study provides\nfurther evidence supporting an idea that intransitive gestures as\nless complex, highly conventionalized, and for that reason more\noften seen and used in naturalistic settings, are also easier to\ncategorize as compared to rarely perceived and performed transi-\ntive gestures (tool use pantomimes), as well as meaningless hand\nmovements. This is the case regardless of the testing conditions.\nMoreover, in the context of additional pictorial cues (i.e., images\nof hand postures for intransitive, and tools for transitive gestures),\nthe response facilitation observed for both gesture categories was\nin the same direction, thus implying the involvement of some\ncommon mechanisms. Even though transitive gestures, perhaps\nas more difﬁcult to retrieve in the ﬁrst place, gained way more\nfrom these “prompts,” as such, our results from a study using\npictures as primes do not undermine a view that the two ges-\nture categories might be processed within a common network.\nAfter all, the ﬁnding that the categorization of both gesture types\n(though much less in the case of in transitive gestures) was more\nefﬁcient when the relevant pictorial cues were presented on the\nright—i.e., projected to the left hemisphere—is yet another piece\nof evidence that the understanding and control of meaningful ges-\nture depends to a high degree on left-lateralized representations\nof praxis skills. It should be emphasized still again, though, that\nintransitive gestures depend substantially less on their input. (Yet,\nthey are easier anyways.)\nConsistent with the observation that intransitive gestures\nmay be somewhat less lateralized—or rather more bilaterally\nrepresented—is our second major ﬁnding, namely that of their\nparticular sensitivity to linguistic cues processed in both hemi-\nspheres. On the one hand, a dramatic facilitation in cate-\ngorizing them as “conversational” following right-sided words\nor phrases supports the view of their dependence on left-\nlateralized mechanisms, which might be common with language\nfunctions (cf. Kroliczak et al., 2011; Vingerhoets et al., 2013 ;\nsee also Goldenberg, 2013b; Króliczak, 2013a ). On the other\nhand, although not surprisingly their categorization is substan-\ntially slower when relevant cues are ﬁrst processed in the right\nhemisphere, this processing is in fact more detrimental than\na veriﬁcation that a right-sided cue is irrelevant. These ﬁnd-\nings are in fact consistent with a very long-standing conviction\n(e.g., Morlass, 1928 ) that the ability to perform and under-\nstand conventionalized (intransitive) gestures, while relying on\ngeneral praxis representations, may also call for mechanisms\nand skills (e.g., social knowledge) implemented in different\nbrain areas, including the right hemisphere. As suggested in the\nIntroduction, this idea has indeed prominently ﬁgured in mod-\nern theories of praxis (cf. Gonzalez Rothi et al., 1991 )i m p l y i n g\nthat the mechanisms involved in retrieval of intransitive actions\n(including manual emblems) may be distributed across both\nhemispheres.\nFinally, and quite unexpectedly, transitive gestures do not show\nmuch afﬁnity to relevant linguistic cues, since their categorization\nwas much slower in their presence and resembled that of mean-\ningless actions. Yet, one cannot judge from such data that their\nrepresentations are not left lateralized.\nLIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY\nIt would be best if eye movements were monitored in such\na paradigm, although prime duration of only 150 ms and the\nimmediate mask make it less of a problem. It would be also better\nif primes appeared simultaneously in the right and left visual ﬁeld,\nand attention to these lateralized primes was directly controlled\nfor by an additional central cue. (For any further suggestions on\nand/or criticisms of visual half-ﬁeld paradigms, see Hunter and\nBrysbaert, 2008).\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn sum, this study shows evidence that the categorization of\nintransitive gestures may also draw on contributions from pro-\ncesses or mechanisms taking place outside of the left-lateralized\npraxis representation network. Indeed, it is justiﬁed to say that\nsome of these processes (or mechanisms) might be located in the\nright cerebral hemisphere. Furthermore, and quite surprisingly,\nthis seems to be particularly true when linguistic processing is\ninvolved. Yet, this conclusion would be much stronger were it not\nfor the fact that such linguistic cues also affect the processing of\ntool use gestures in a rather unexpected way.\nAPPENDIX: MEANINGFUL STIMULUS VIDEOS\nIntransitive gestures: Beckoning, Counting, Flicking, Hitchhiking,\nPointing, Scolding, Shooing, Snapping, Stopping, Talking,\nWavering, Waving.\nTransitive gestures : Dialing, Painting, Pounding, Pouring,\nReeling, Scrubbing, Sewing, Typing, Unlocking, Using a remote\ncontrol, Using a spoon, Writing.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nThis project was conceptualized by Honorata Helon and Gregory\nKróliczak.
