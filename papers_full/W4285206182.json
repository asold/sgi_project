Hence, we propose a task-free en-\nhancement module termed as Heterogeneous\nLinguistics Graph (HLG) to enhance Chinese\npre-trained language models by integrating\nlinguistics knowledge. Speciﬁcally, we con-\nstruct a hierarchical heterogeneous graph to\nmodel the characteristics linguistics structure\nof Chinese language, and conduct a graph-\nbased method to summarize and concretize\ninformation on different granularities of Chi-\nnese linguistics hierarchies. Experimental re-\nsults demonstrate our model has the ability\nto improve the performance of vanilla BERT,\nBERTwwm and ERNIE 1.0 on 6 natural lan-\nguage processing tasks with 10 benchmark\ndatasets. Further, the detailed experimental\nanalyses have proven that this kind of mod-\nelization achieves more improvements com-\npared with previous strong baseline MWA.\nMeanwhile, our model introduces far fewer\nparameters (about half of MWA) and the\ntraining/inference speed is about 7x faster\nthan MWA. Our code and processed datasets\nare available at https://github.com/\nlsvih/HLG.\n1 Introduction\nPre-trained Language Models (PLM) (Peters et al.,\n2018; Devlin et al., 2019; Radford et al., 2018;\nYang et al., 2019) have recently demonstrated the\neffectiveness on a variety of natural language pro-\ncessing (NLP) tasks, such as machine translation\nand text summarization. For a speciﬁc downstream\ntask, the parameters of PLMs can be ﬁne-tuned\n∗Both authors contributed equally to this work\n†Corresponding Author\nwith accurately labeled instances or weakly labeled\ninstances of the task to achieve better performance.\nIn recent, there are a series of studies on adapting\nPLMs for Chinese (Meng et al., 2019; Sun et al.,\n2019; Cui et al., 2019a; Sun et al., 2020; Wei et al.,\n2019; Diao et al., 2020; Lai et al., 2021). Many re-\nsearchers introduce the Chinese-speciﬁc linguistics\nknowledge such as word information into PLMs by\nconducting elaborate self-supervised tasks to pre-\ntrain Chinese PLMs from scratch. Nevertheless,\npre-training a PLM is computationally expensive\nand time-consuming since it needs large-scale Chi-\nnese corpus and heavy computational resources.\nThe high cost makes it difﬁcult for researchers to\npre-train a PLM from scratch.\nAn alternative way is to integrate the Chinese-\nspeciﬁc linguistics knowledge into pre-trained\nPLMs in the ﬁne-tuning stage in downstream tasks\ndirectly. Following this idea, the task-free enhance-\nment module is widely used in the ﬁne-tuning stage\nby adding an additional adapter in PLMs to in-\ntegrate external knowledge (Li et al., 2020). As\nshown in Figure 1, the enhancement module is in-\nserted between PLMs and task-speciﬁc module,\nand its inputs are the hidden representations of\nPLMs and embeddings of external knowledge. To\nachieve the goal of integrating external knowledge\ninto PLMs in the ﬁne-tuning stage, the enhance-\nment module should have the following character-\nistics. First, as a plug-in adapter module in ﬁne-\ntuning stage, it should maintain consistent output\nformulation with PLM. Second, it should not in-\ntroduce unacceptable time or space complexity for\ntraining and inference. Third, it should improve the\nperformance of downstream tasks universally.\nWith the core idea of the enhancement mod-\nule, Li et al. (2020) proposed a multi-source word-\naligned model (MWA) to enhance PLMs by inte-\ngrating Chinese Word Segmentation (CWS) bound-\n1986\n……\n……\nPre-trained \nLanguage Model\n……\nTask-Specific\nModel\nFine-tuning\n……\n……\nPre-trained \nLanguage Model\n……\nTask-Specific\nModel\nFine-tuning\nEnhancement Module\n…\nExternal\nKnowledge\nFigure 1: The diagram of Enhancement Module frame-\nwork. Left: Fine-tuning PLM ordinarily. Right: En-\nhancement for Fine-tuning PLM.\naries information implicitly. It ﬁrst exploits var-\nious CWS tools to generate multiple word se-\nquences and then utilizes word-aligned attention\nwith a mixed pooling to integrate the word infor-\nmation into characters. Experimental results show\nthat MWA has the ability to utilize CWS segmen-\ntation information to enhance Chinese PLMs to\nachieve SOTA performance in many downstream\nNLP tasks. However, MWA has two weaknesses:\n1) Efﬁciency Degradation: The model structure of\nMW A is naturally non-parallel and cannot beneﬁt\nfrom GPU acceleration (detailed in §4.3.3), which\nresults in time inefﬁciencies in both training and\ninference processes. 2) Linguistic Information\nLoss: MW A utilizes a pooling-based mechanism to\nperform interaction between characters and words.\nSuch a heuristic method could not make full use of\ninformation, resulting in sub-optimal results.\nTo tackle the aforementioned limitations, we pro-\npose Heterogeneous Linguistics Graph ( HLG),\nwhich is Graph Neural Network (GNN) based\nmethod to integrate CWS information to enhance\nPLMs. Speciﬁcally, the hierarchical CWS informa-\ntion is ﬁrst conducted by a heterogeneous graph,\nwhich contains character nodes, word nodes and\nsentence nodes. The edge between nodes indicates\nthe inclusion relationship of the grammatical struc-\nture between the linguistic hierarchies. Then, a\nsimple but effective multi-step information propa-\ngation (MSIP) is proposed to incorporate the lin-\nguistics knowledge of heterogeneous graph to en-\nhance Chinese PLMs inductively. In this way, we\ncan obtain adequate information interaction among\ncharacters, words and sentences. Furthermore, the\ninternal implementation of HLG is highly paral-\nlelized, which is conducive to GPU accelerate and\nraises the operating efﬁciency.\nIn summary, we abstract out an adapter com-\nponent named enhancement module for PLMs to\nintegrate external knowledge during the ﬁne-tuning\nstage. In this paradigm, we further introduce HLG\nto integrate CWS information delicately and model\nit via an effective MSIP. Extensive experiments\nconducted on 10 benchmark datasets of 6 NLP\ntasks demonstrate that our model outperforms the\nBERT, BERTwwm and ERNIE 1.0 signiﬁcantly\nand steadily. Comparing with MW A, a strong base-\nline that also incorporates CWS information to en-\nhance PLMs, our model achieves a steady improve-\nment with the same information. Meanwhile, com-\npared with previous work, MWA, our proposed\nHLG introduces only half additional parameters\nand the training/inference speed is about 7x faster.\n2 Preliminaries\n2.1 Pre-trained Language Model (PLM)\nAs mentioned in §1, the pre-trained language mod-\nels (PLMs) have achieved great success in many\nNLP applications with the 2-stage paradigm of pre-\ntraining and ﬁne-tuning. The PLMs usually per-\nform pre-training on large-scale unlabeled corpus\nin virtue of self-supervised reconstruction tasks.\nFor example, BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Repre-\nsentations from Transformers) (Devlin et al., 2019)\nis a typical well-known PLM, which conducts\nmasked language modeling and next sentence pre-\ndiction as pre-training tasks. After completing the\npre-training, the PLMs learn substantial contextual-\nized text representations, and then adapt ﬁne-tuning\non speciﬁc downstream tasks.\nIn Chinese NLP, PLMs are generally character-\nbased models (Li et al., 2019; Cui et al., 2019a).\nSpeciﬁcally, given a character sequence:\nS = [c1,c2,...,c n] (1)\nthe outputs of Chinese PLMs can be treated as the\ncharacter-level representations H ∈Rn×d, where\nthe dis the dimension of representation.\n2.2 Chinese Word Segmentation\nAs the same as most East-Asian languages, Chinese\nlanguage is written without explicit word delimiters\nand the character is the smallest morpheme unit in\nChinese linguistic (Cai and Zhao, 2016). Although\ncharacter-based models could achieve good per-\nformance (Li et al., 2019), Li et al. (2020) point\nout that introducing Chinese Word Segmentation\n1987\n北 京 西 山 森 林 公 园[CLS] [SEP]Characters\nWords\nSentences\n山mountain\n森林\nforest\n公园\npark\nS2\n西\nwest\nS3\n西山\nwestern mountain\n森林公园\nforestal park\n[SEP]北京\nBeijing[CLS]\nS1\nFigure 2: Overview of HLG structure. Different colored lines represent sentences formed by different CWS tools.\n(CWS) information to character-based models can\neffectively improve the model performance.\nWe give a formality deﬁnition of segmenter and\nits partition strategy π. Given a sentence consisting\nof a sequence of characters as Eq. 1, a segmenter\nis deﬁned as:\nSEGMENTER ≡π: S →S′\nwhere πis a partition strategy of sentence. Speciﬁ-\ncally, πpartition and group the character sequence\nSinto the word sequence S′:\nπ(S) = S′= [w1,w2,...,w m] (2)\nwhere m ≤ n and wi = [ cs,cs+1,...,c s+l−1]\nis the i-th segmented word with a length of l\nand s is the index of wi’s ﬁrst character in S.\nNamely, the word wi is a sequence of characters\n{cs,cs+1,...,c s+l−1}, and the sentence S′is a se-\nquence of words {w1,w2,...,w m}.\n2.3 MW A for Enhancing Chinese PLM\nLi et al. (2020) carried out researches on integrat-\ning CWS information into Chinese PLMs. The au-\nthors brought an architecture named Multi-source\nWord-aligned Attention (MWA) to incorporate\nmulti-granularity segmentation via pooling atten-\ntion weights among characters within the word.\nFormally, given a character sequence Sas Eq. 1\nand its partition strategy πas Eq. 2. The character-\nbased representation H could be gained via PLM,\nMW A conducted self-attention between characters:\nA = softmax\n((KWk)(QWq)T\n√\nd\n)\nwhere Q and K are both H, dis deﬁned in §2.1,\nand A represents the attention score matrix. We\ndecompose A over columns as [a1,a2,..., an],\nand then perform partition π on it: π(A) =\n[{a1,a2},{a3},...{as\nc,..., as+l−1\nc }...,{an−1,an}]\nwhere s and l are deﬁned in §2.2. Pooling each\ngroup of partitioned columns:\nai\nw = MixPooling({as\nc,..., as+l−1\nc })\nin which MixPooling is deﬁned in Yu et al.\n(2014). The gained Aw = [ a1\nw,a2\nw,..., am\nw ] ∈\nRn×m is the character-to-word attention weight\nmatrix. After performing alignment-wise multi-\nply (Li et al., 2020) between character-to-word at-\ntention weight matrix Aw and the character-based\nrepresentation H, the enhanced character-based rep-\nresentation which integrates CWS information can\nbe obtained.\nIn essence, the MWA conducts interaction be-\ntween characters and words via character-to-word\nattention weight matrix Aw, implicitly summary\nthe information from characters, and performs Mix-\nPooling to aggregate the word-based segmentation\ninformation and concrete the character-level repre-\nsentation.\n3 Heterogeneous Linguistics Graph\nThis section introduces the components of our\nmodel HLG which instantiates the enhancement\nmodule by exploiting the CWS information. We\nﬁrst brieﬂy explain the graph convolutional net-\nwork as our base encoder, and then describe the\ngraph construction of HLG. Finally, we give the\ndetails of the multi-step information propagation\n(MSIP) to integrate the CWS information into\nPLMs.\n3.1 Graph Convolutional Network\nGraph Convolutional Network (GCN) (Bruna et al.,\n2014; Kipf and Welling, 2017; Defferrard et al.,\n2016) is a powerful tool to extend the convolution\noperation from the grid data to irregular graph data.\n1988\nThe basic idea of GCN is to aggregate the represen-\ntations of neighbors to obtain better representation\nexpression of nodes in the graph. For instance, con-\nsider a homogeneous graphG= (V,E) constructed\nby nodes set Vand edges set E. A ∈R|V|×|V| is a\nbinary adjacency matrix where each element Aij\ndenotes whether node ihas an edge with node j\nin the edge set E. Formally, a standard GCN layer\ncan be abstracted as:\nHout = σ(ˆAHinW), ˆA = Norm(A) (3)\nwhere Hin denotes the input representation matrix,\nHout is the updated representation matrix, Norm(·)\nmeans row normalizing function, ˆA is the normal-\nized adjacency matrix, σ(·) is the ReLU function\nand W is a parameter matrix. After such convolu-\ntion operation, the representation Hin were aggre-\ngated rely on edge connections deﬁned by A, and\ntransformed into Hout by linear multiplication and\nactive function.\n3.2 Graph Construction\nWe build a heterogeneous graph G= (C,W,S,E)\nto model the structure of Chinese linguistic, where\nC, W, S, Edenote the character nodeset, word\nnodeset, sentence nodeset and edge set, respec-\ntively. Besides, different from homogeneous graph,\nHLG models relationship between three granulari-\nties of linguistic in a hierarchical way.\nAs presented in Figure 2, Gis composed of three\nhierarchies including characters, words and sen-\ntences. In this case, we employed three different\nCWS tools, and got three different segmentation re-\nsults, which resulted in three sentences with slightly\ndifferent semantics. Note that the same word seg-\nmentation results in the same position obtained\nby different CWS tools will be regarded as the\nsame word node to enhance the interaction (e.g.,\nBeijing and park in Figure 2). This purpose is to\ndenoise the mistake word nodes brought by seg-\nmenter error. If a word is segmented by multiple\nsegmenters at the same time, the corresponding\nword node will have a higher vertex degree. Such\nnodes with higher betweenness centrality will lead\nto a stronger inﬂuence on the followed information\npropagation and achieve the effect of denoising\nintuitively, like the vote-based multi-model ensem-\nble.\nIn HLG, only one adjacency matrix A is not\nenough to describe the hierarchical relationships be-\ntween characters, words and sentences. Hence, we\n𝐀\"\t\n\"#$\n𝐀\" \t\n$#% 𝐀\"\t\n%#$\n𝐀\"\t\n$#\"\n𝐇!

The green, orange and gray lines\ndescribe the summarization (Eq. 4), concretization (Eq.\n6) and skip connection (Eq. 7) operations, respectively.\nconduct two interaction matrices ¯Ac2w ∈R|W|×|C|\nand ¯Aw2s ∈R|S|×|W| to indicate aforementioned\nrelationships. To be speciﬁc, we take the ¯Ac2w as\nan example (the one for ¯Aw2s is analogous), the\nelement ¯Ac2w\nij denotes whether word ihas an edge\nwith character jin the edge set E. Similar to Eq.\n3, we also denote normalized interaction matrices\nas ˆA\nc2w\nand ˆA\nw2s\n.\n3.3 Multi-Step Information Propagation\nTo model the granularities hierarchical relation-\nships in G, we devise a multi-step information prop-\nagation to learn the linguistics knowledge. In CWS,\nthe partition and group processes could be consid-\nered as the partition of semantic representation and\nthe aggregation of separated semantic respectively\n(detailed in §2.2). Inspired by CWS processes, we\nintroduce two operations into MSIP to simulate\nsuch processes and named as summarization and\nconcretization. Figure 3 shows the information\npropagation procedure of MSIP.\nSummarization. The summarization operation\nfocuses on generalizing hierarchical word and sen-\ntence representations (e.g., from character-level to\nword-level). Speciﬁcally, given a heterogeneous\ngraph Gand corresponding character representa-\ntions Hc from PLM, the summarization operation\ncan be formulated as follows:\nHw = σ(ˆA\nc2w\nHcWc2w),\nHs = σ(ˆA\nw2s\nHwWw2s),\n(4)\nwhere the Wc2w, Ww2s are parameter matrices,\nHw, Hs are the interim representations of words\nand sentences.\n1989\nConcretization. Concretization is the inverse op-\neration of summarization, it is used to repartition\nthe semantics from high-level to low-level (e.g.\nfrom sentence-level to word-level). To do so, we\nﬁrst calculate the normalized interaction matrices\nˆA\ns2w\nand ˆA\nw2c\n, which can be simply obtained\nby ﬁrst transposed then normalized the predeﬁned\ninteraction matrices ¯Aw2s and ¯Ac2w, respectively.\nThus, we have:\nˆA\ns2w\n= Norm\n(\n(¯Aw2s)⊤)\n,\nˆA\nw2c\n= Norm\n(\n(¯Ac2w)⊤)\n,\n(5)\nwhere (·)⊤is the transpose function. Afterward,\nthe concretization operation is deﬁned as follows:\nH\nw′\n= σ(ˆA\ns2w\nHsWs2w),\nH\nc′\n= σ(ˆA\nw2c\nHw′\nWw2c),\n(6)\nwhere Ws2w and Ww2c are parameter matrices,\nH\nw′\nand H\nc′\nare also interim word and character\nrepresentations, Hw′\ndenote the ﬁnal word repre-\nsentations deﬁned in Eq. 7.\nSkip Connection. Intuitively, it is difﬁcult to gen-\nerate satisﬁed low-level representations from the\nhigh-level representations directly. For example,\nit is easy to learn a few sentence representations\nfrom dozens of word representations, but hard to\ngenerate dozens of word representations from a few\nsentence representations.\nTo mitigate this problem, in this paper, we in-\ntroduce the skip connection to enhance the MSIP,\nwhich is to simulate the self-loop in vanilla GCN.\nAs shown in Figure 3, we add skip connections\nbetween the summarization representations and the\nconcretization representations directly. Formally,\nthe skip connection can be simply expressed as:\nHw′\n= H\nw′\n+ σ(HwWw),\nHc′\n= H\nc′\n+ σ(HcWc),\n(7)\nwhere Ww and Wc are parameter matrices. Fur-\nthermore, Hc′\ndenote the ﬁnal representations for\ncharacters, which incorporates the ﬁne-grained lin-\nguistics knowledge in G.\n4 Experiments\n4.1 Experimental Setting\nFor a fair comparison with MW A, which also gives\nan enhancement module by incorporating CWS in-\nformation. We conduct the same experiments on\nﬁve NLP tasks with various benchmark datasets.\nThree frequently-used Chinese PLMs: BERT (De-\nvlin et al., 2019), ERNIE 1.0 (Sun et al., 2019) and\nBERTwwm (Cui et al., 2019a) are employed as\nthe basic PLM to enhance. Three CWS tools: thu-\nlac (Sun et al., 2016a), ictclas (Zhang et al., 2003)\nand hanlp (He, 2014) are employed to gain the seg-\nmentation information. The time of pre-processing\nincluding applying CWS tools is ignored in the ex-\nperimental report. In the production, preprocessing\nand inference can be asynchronously executed in\nparallel (while inference a batch of data, the subse-\nquence data can be preprocessed with multiprocess)\n(Cheng et al., 2019), all three of the CWS tools\nwe’ve introduced are fast enough to achieve this\neffect. According to rough estimates and technical\nreports, the processing speed of these tools are thu-\nlac 1221KB/s, ictclas 769KB/s, hanlp 1375KB/s,\nrespectively.\nSpeciﬁcally, we instantiate the enhancement\nmodule as HLG and incorporate with downstream\ntask-speciﬁc model. To verify the effectiveness of\nHLG, we execute 5 times ﬁne-tuning on 10 bench-\nmark datasets of 6 NLP tasks and report the aver-\nage score. The tasks include Sentiment Classiﬁca-\ntion (SC), Document Classiﬁcation (DC), Named\nEntity Recognition (NER), Sentence Pair Match-\ning (SPM), Natural Language Inference (NLI) and\nMachine Reading Comprehension (MRC). Speciﬁ-\ncally, the following benchmark datasets are chosen\nto evaluate the performance: 1) SC: ChnSenti1 and\nweibo100k2 sentiment datasets are used for eval-\nuating the capacity of short text classiﬁcation. 2)\nDC: THUCNews (Sun et al., 2016b) dataset con-\ntains 10 types of news for performing long text\nclassiﬁcation. 3) NER: Ontonotes 4.0 (Weischedel\net al., 2011) and MSRA-NER (Levow, 2006a) are\nused for testing model in sequence tagging task. 4)\nSPM: LCQMC (Liu et al., 2018) and BQ (Chen\net al., 2018) are used to evaluate the text match-\ning ability of model. 5) NLI: We conduct experi-\nments on the Chinese part of XNLI (Conneau et al.,\n2018) dataset, and adopt the same pre-processing\nstrategy as ERNIE (Sun et al., 2019). 6) MRC:\nCommonly used datasets DRCD (Shao et al., 2018)\nand CMRC2018 (Cui et al., 2019b) are tested.\nCMRC2018 is only evaluated on dev set as same\nas (Wei et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2020).\n1https://github.com/pengming617/bert_\nclassification\n2https://github.com/SophonPlus/\nChineseNlpCorpus/\n1990\nSC NER SPM\nCHNSENTI WEIBO 100 K MSRA-NER ONTONOTES LCQMC BQ\nBERT 94.72 97.31 93.62 79.18 86.50 84.73\n+MW A 95.34(+0.62) 98.14(+0.83) 93.86(+0.24) 79.86(+0.68) 86.92(+0.42) 84.87(+0.14)\n+HLG 95.83(+1.11) 98.17(+0.86) 93.82(+0.20) 80.42(+1.24) 87.79(+1.29) 85.01(+0.28)\nBERTwwm 94.38 97.36 93.83 79.28 86.11 84.75\n+MW A 95.01(+0.63) 98.13(+0.77) 93.84(+0.01) 80.32(+1.04) 86.28(+0.17) 85.02(+0.27)\n+HLG 95.25(+0.87) 98.11(+0.75) 93.96(+0.13) 80.46(+1.18) 88.13(+2.02) 84.98(+0.23)\nERNIE 1.0 95.17 97.30 93.97 77.74 87.27 84.78\n+MW A 95.52(+0.35) 98.18(+0.88) 94.04(+0.07) 78.78(+1.04) 87.58(+0.31) 85.06(+0.28)\n+HLG 95.83(+0.66) 98.22(+0.92) 94.04(+0.07) 79.16(+1.42) 87.80(+0.53) 85.04(+0.26)\nDC NLI MRC\nTHUN EWS XNLI DRCD[EM | F1] CMRC2018[EM | F1]\nBERT 96.78 78.19 85.57 91.16 66.36 85.88\n+MW A 97.13(+0.35) 78.42(+0.23) 86.86(+1.29) 92.22(+1.06) 67.21(+0.85) 86.22(+0.34)\n+HLG 97.20(+0.42) 78.68(+0.49) 86.96(+1.39) 92.28(+1.12) 67.30(+0.94) 86.27(+0.39)\nBERTwwm 97.01 77.92 84.11 90.46 66.20 85.85\n+MW A 97.28(+0.27) 78.68(+0.76) 87.00(+2.89) 92.21(+1.75) 67.43(+1.23) 86.49(+0.64)\n+HLG 97.32(+0.31) 79.01(+1.09) 86.92(+2.81) 92.15(+1.69) 67.51(+1.31) 86.53(+0.68)\nERNIE 1.0 97.04 78.04 87.85 92.85 65.74 85.78\n+MW A 97.34(+0.30) 78.71(+0.67) 88.61(+0.76) 93.72(+0.87) 67.12(+1.38) 86.30(+0.52)\n+HLG 97.35(+0.31) 78.80(+0.76) 88.58(+0.73) 93.60(+0.75) 67.03(+1.29) 86.26(+0.48)\nTable 1: The experimental results on various datasets. All of the experiments except CMRC2018 are conducted\non test set, the reported values are F1 unless speciﬁed (EM means exact match score). We run each experiment\nwith a random seed for ﬁve times and report the average score. Numbers in brackets indicate the relative increment\nbrought by enhancement module. The bold numbers mark the highest value within the same base-model.\nWe implement the presented approach in Py-\nTorch and ﬁne-tune the downstream tasks on multi-\nple Nvidia Tesla V100 GPUs. The basic architec-\nture of PLMs and pre-trained parameters are pro-\nvided by Huggingface (Wolf et al., 2020). The ini-\ntial learning rate and other hyper-parameters refer\nto the previous works reported (Cui et al., 2019a;\nLi et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020). Since the pa-\nrameters of PLMs have been optimized, while the\nparameters of HLG and the downstream tasks are\nuntrained. Hence, the learning rate of HLG part\nis larger than PLM part, we manually tuned the\nlearning rates of PLM and HLG separately.\n4.2 Experimental Results\nThe experimental results are shown in Table 1.\nOverall, we can observe that both HLG and MW A\noutperform baseline models (BERT, BERTwwm\nand ERNIE 1.0). Comparing with WMA, HLG\nachieves further improvement and signiﬁcantly out-\nperforms baseline models on 10 tasks. In detail,\nHLG outperforms MW A on ChnSent, weibo100k,\nMSRA-NER, ontonotes, LCQMC, BQ, THUC-\nNews and XNLI tasks, and obtains comparable\nresults on DRCD and CMRC2018 datasets.\nFor the text classiﬁcation tasks, namely SC\nand DC, HLG respectively achieves 0.88% and\n0.84% average improvement on ChnSenti and\nweibo100k dataset, while MWA gains 0.53% and\n0.82%. Meanwhile, HLG obtains 0.35% improve-\nment on the long text multi-classiﬁcation bench-\nmark THUCNews, and MW A gets 0.31% points.\nComparing with text classiﬁcation tasks, the\nimprovements over NER tasks are more obvious.\nThe main reason may be that CWS explicitly pro-\nvides the word boundaries, which are important\nto recognize entities accurately. On the ontonotes\ndataset, the promotion of HLG (1.28% averagely)\nis distinctly higher than that of MWA (0.92% av-\neragely). Compared to the strong baseline models,\nthe F1 scores of MSRA-NER have improved aver-\nage 0.13% and 0.10% by HLG and MW A, respec-\ntively.\nHLG achieves the best results on the text match-\ning tasks (SPM) and its variant NLI, which brings\n1.28% average improvement to LCQMC, 0.26%\naverage improvement to BQ, and 0.78% average\nimprovement to XNLI. The improvements of HLG\nare much higher than that of MWA (0.3%, 0.23%\nand 0.55%). As described in Chen et al.

(2021), text matching tasks can beneﬁt\nfrom the interaction between the paired sentences.\nHLG follows them to construct graphs over sen-\ntence pairs collectively, which naturally obtains\nadvantages in text matching tasks.\nFor MRC task, HLG and MWA achieve com-\nparable results on those datasets. HLG gets an\naverage improvement of 1.41 in EM and 0.85 in F1\nscore, while MW A gets 1.4 EM and 0.86 F1 score.\nHowever, HLG has dominant advantage in training\nspeed and inference speed. Detail analysis of time\nefﬁciency is in §4.3.3.\n4.3 Analyses\n4.3.1 Ablation Study\nWe conduct ablation experiments to explore the\neffectiveness of the number of CWS tools. The\nablation experiments are organized on sentiment\nclassiﬁcation task, ChnSenti and weibo100k dev\nset. As shown in Table 2, 5 popular CWS tools\nare added into our model successively according\nto the order, and we also show the total number\nof word nodes in our HLG. Meanwhile, the infor-\nmation from multiple word segmentation tools can\nbe integrated at the same time without increasing\nparameter size in HLG (only the A is changed).\nFigure 4 shows the performance of BERT+HLG\nwith different numbers of CWS tools on ChnSenti\nand weibo100k dev sets. Experimental results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of introducing word\nsegmentation information. We can observe that\nwhen the number of CWS tools is larger, the num-\nber of generated word nodes gradually increasing\nto converge, and the performance of the model\nslightly is not always increasing as the word count.\nThe more CWS tools introduced will bring more\ndiversity but also bring noise caused by segmenter\nerror. In practice, we ﬁnd using 4 or more CWS\ntools can slightly increase the performance but take\nmuch longer preprocessing time, hence we select\nthe elbow of the curve as the number of CWS tools.\nWeibo 100k\nWord Node Count Word Node Count\nF1 score (%) F1 score (%)\nChnSenti\nFigure 4: The histogram chart is the cumulative number\nof word nodes obtained by CWS tools, and the line\nchart is the performance of the model (BERT+HLG) in\ndev-set with the corresponding number of CWS tools.\nModel Params.

This number also\ncoincides with the conﬁguration in MW A.\n4.3.2 Parameter-Efﬁcient Analysis\nIn general, the enhancement module should be able\nto bring performance improvements without unac-\nceptable space complexity. Therefore, we conduct\na comparative experiment on XNLI dev set to ex-\nplore the performance improvement and the space\noverhead between MW A and HLG.\nTo be speciﬁc, the number of parameters in\nMWA depends on the dimension of PLM’s rep-\nresentation and the number of CWS tools K. Con-\ncretely, MWA containsK transformer layers and\n1 aggregation layer. Nevertheless, our HLG only\ndepends on the dimension of PLM’s representation\nand simply contains 4 basic GCN layers and 2 skip\nconnections. Thus, the number of parameters of\n1992\nModel Params.

Table 3 reports the per-\nformance of BERT, BERTwwm, and ERNIE 1.0\non the XNLI dev set. Obviously, HLG can get a\ngreater performance improvement with only half\nadditional parameters. It shows that as an enhance-\nment module, HLG is superior to MWA in terms\nof parameter utilization efﬁciency.\nIn addition, to verify the impact of the addi-\ntional parameters, we also conduct an ablation\nexperiment on XNLI dev set that utilizes the ran-\ndom tokenizer, the single-character tokenizer, and\nsole segmenter to obtain the different word seg-\nmentation results, and send those results to HLG to\neliminate the additional beneﬁt from the change of\nneural network structure and the increase of param-\neters. The results are shown in Table 4, which indi-\ncates that the increment of parameters can slightly\naffect character-based model performance, and the\nCWS information is signiﬁcantly useful to promote\nthe performance of character-based PLM.\n4.3.3 Time Efﬁciency Analysis\nTime efﬁciency is an important indicator in the\nreal-world production. Less training time and infer-\nence time means lower costs. In order to analyze\nthe additional time cost of different enhancement\nmodules, we conduct comparative experiments\namong BERT, BERT+MW A, and BERT+HLG on\nChnSenti, LCQMC and XNLI datasets. For the\nfair comparison, we remain other hyper-parameters\nconsistent for the three models.\nAs shown in Figure 5, we compare time cost\nduring training and inference between vanilla\nBERT, BERT+MWA and BERT+HLG. We can\nobserve that the training time and inference time of\nFigure 5: The training time, inference time of vanilla\nBERT, BERT+MWA and BERT+HLG on ChnSenti,\nLCQMC and XNLI benchmarks. All of these time dose\nnot include CWS process.\nBERT+HLG are basically consistent with vanilla\nBERT. However, when MWA is introduced, the\naverage training time increases by 7 times, and\nthe average inference time increases by 7.6 times.\nThis is because MW A must calculate aligned atten-\ntion weights token by token, and it cannot beneﬁt\nfrom CUDNN parallelization, resulting in terrible\noperating efﬁciency. On the contrary, HLG is com-\nposed of GCNs, and its internal implementation\nis basically the simplest non-linear transformation.\nTherefore, HLG could be maximally accelerated\nthrough the optimized matrix operation of CUDNN\nprimitive, which only produces a negligible impact\non time efﬁciency.\n5 Related Works\nPre-training language models, such as ELMo (Pe-\nters et al., 2018), BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), XL-\nNET (Yang et al., 2019) and GPT (Radford et al.,\n2018), have shown their powerful performances on\nvarious natural language processing tasks and have\nbeen applied in many applications.\nIn recent past, there are studies adapting PLMs\nfor Chinese with Chinese-speciﬁc features such as\nword information. Glyce (Meng et al., 2019) pro-\nposed to use the glyph information of Chinese char-\nacters to enhance PLMs. ERNIE 1.0/2.0 (Sun et al.,\n2019, 2020) and BERTwwm (Cui et al., 2019a)\nused the whole word mask to learn the structure\nof words or entities in the pre-training stage and\nconducted more and better pre-training tasks to per-\nceive large-scale data. NEZHA (Wei et al., 2019)\nused a series of methods such as functional relative\n1993\npositional encoding and whole word masking to\nimprove the pre-training tasks, which had brought\nimprovement. ZEN (Diao et al., 2020) adopted\nn-gram masking to enhance pre-trained encoder\nand obtained outstanding performance. Lattice-\nBERT (Lai et al., 2021) introduced word lattice in-\nformation (Zhang and Yang, 2018) into pre-training\nframework via lattice position attention.\nAs a fundamental feature of Chinese, word seg-\nmentation information is ﬂexibility, granularity,\nand easy-to-get (Sproat and Emerson, 2003; Levow,\n2006b). Further, Zhang et al. (2018); Li et al. (2019,\n2020) conducted detailed research and experiments\non the application of CWS in deep learning, and\nfound that CWS information can effectively im-\nprove the performance of Chinese character-based\nPLMs.\nRecently, a lot of works have been proposed to\nprompt NLP applications by constructing graph on\ntext and modeling with graph neural networks. Yao\net al. (2019) ﬁrst constructed word co-occurrence\ngraph between documents and introduced GCN to\nmodeling and aggregating document representa-\ntion for text classiﬁcation. Chen et al. (2020); Lyu\net al. (2021) constructed lattice graph to maintain\nmulti-granularity information and external knowl-\nedge in Chinese short text matching task. Nguyen\nand Grishman (2018) proposed performing GCN\nover dependency trees to extract event trigger. Sui\net al. (2019) conducted a character-word interaction\ngraph and performed graph attention network on\nit to recognize Chinese named entities. Shu et al.\n(2020) introduced a bipartite-graph based trans-\nformer PLM for integrating hierarchical semantic\ninformation.\n6 Conclusion\nIn this paper, we propose HLG which acts as the en-\nhancement module to enhance Chinese PLMs with\nCWS information. The HLG ﬁrstly constructs het-\nerogeneous graph based on multiple word segmen-\ntations to model the hierarchy of Chinese. Then,\nthe MSIP is proposed to model the ﬁne-grained\nlinguistics knowledge of the heterogeneous graph.\nExperimental results on 6 NLP tasks with 10 bench-\nmark datasets demonstrate that the performance of\nour model outperforms previous work, MW A. Be-\nsides the performance improvements, HLG intro-\nduces only half the additional parameters of MW A\nand its training/inference speed is 7x faster than\nMW A. At present, the experimental results of HLG\nare lagging behind SOTA, and we will try to mi-\ngrate it to some of the latest PLMs. Besides, HLG\nhas the expansibility to introduce the representation\nlayer of the CWS model directly, or introduce some\nother information sources such as the knowledge\ngraph, etc. We leave these further improvements to\nthe future.\nAcknowledgement\nThis work is supported by the National Key Re-\nsearch and Development Program of China (grant\nNo.2021YFB3100600 and 2020YFB2103803), the\nStrategic Priority Research Program of Chinese\nAcademy of Sciences (grant No.XDC02040400),\nthe Youth Innovation Promotion Association of\nCAS (Grant No. 2021153) and National Natural\nScience Foundation of China (Grant No.61902394).\nThis work performed while the ﬁrst author was at\nIIE, CAS.\nReferences\nJoan Bruna, Wojciech Zaremba, Arthur Szlam, and\nYann LeCun. 2014.
