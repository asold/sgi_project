In many transformer substations \nfrom 110 to 500  kV used for years, some silicone rub -\nber composite insulators of current transformer (CT), \npotential transformer (PT), circuit breaker, and surge \narrester have showed different levels of ageing and crack -\ning phenomena. It seriously affected safe operation of the \npower transmission and transformation equipments and \nelectrical power system.\nWe have examined the composite insulators of CT \n(SAS550, MWB Shanghai Transformer Co., Ltd.) with \n8  years service time from a 500  kV alternating cur -\nrent (AC) substation in Sichuan Power Grid of China. \nThey were out of service now and the picture was given \nin Fig.  1. Cracking and chalking phenomena were \nobserved on the surface of the insulation bushing of \nCT, while the inner parts remained intact, as shown in \nFig.  2. This series of CT composite insulator was con -\nsisting of a silicone rubber bushing and a fiber-rein -\nforced plastic (FRP) core. Although several researchers \nhave paid attention to the composite insulator age -\ning, limited knowledge of the long-term performance \nof composite insulators at high voltage is yet avail -\nable (Gubanski et  al. 2007; Guo et  al. 2010; Fernando \nand Gubanski 2010; Lutz et  al. 2012; Jiang 2014). It is \nessential to investigate long-term ageing performance \nOpen Access\n*Correspondence:  wzg33@163.com \nState Grid Sichuan Electric Power Research Institute, Chengdu 610072, \nChina\nPage 2 of 6Wang et al. SpringerPlus  (2016) 5:790 \nand ageing state assessment of the external insulation \nmaterials of silicone rubber  with the help of chemical \ncharacterization methods. \nIn this paper, SAS550 CT insulation bushing (MWB \nShanghai Transformer Co., Ltd.) used for 8 years from a \n500 kV AC substation was investigated by means of sev\n-\neral different test methods on the basis of previous work \nin our group (Wang et al. 2011a, b; Tan et al. 2013). Char\n-\nacteristics including Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) \nspectroscopy, mechanical property analysis, hardness, \nand thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) have been car\n-\nried out on the external surface and internal samples of \nthe silicone rubber CT insulation bushing in different \nparts to study the change of molecular structure and age\n-\ning state.\nExperimental\nMaterials\nAll the samples involved in this paper were collected \nfrom a SAS550 current transformer (MWB Shanghai \nTransformer Co., Ltd.) from a 500  kV AC substation \nwhich was manufactured in Dec. 2004 and have been \nin service for 8  years. The samples were collected from \nsurface and inner of the silicone rubber insulation bush\n-\ning, including the top part, middle part and bottom part, \n6 types of samples were obtained: external surface of the \nbottom part, inner of the bottom part, external surface of \nthe middle part, inner of the middle part, external surface \nof the top part, inner of the top part, they were named as \nS1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, respectively. All the samples were \ncut from on-site CT insulation bushings with the size of \n30 mm × 30 mm × 2 mm. They were cleaned with anhy\n-\ndrous alcohol and deionized water to remove dust and \nwere dried for 24  h at 50  °C in a vacuum oven. All the \nsamples were collected in Aug. 2014 when these CTs had \nalready been out of service.\nATR‑FTIR spectroscopy\nAttenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared \n(ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy was utilized to analyze the \nchange of the molecular structure and functional groups \nin surface and inner parts of the silicone rubber insula\n-\ntion bushing. Each specimen (2  mm in thickness) was \npressed against the KBr plate directly. ATR-FTIR spec\n-\ntra of the silicone rubber CT insulation bushing samples \nwere obtained on a Nicolet 560 FTIR spectrophotometer \n(Nicolet, USA) equipped with an attenuated total reflec\n-\ntance (ATR) attachment between 4000 and 500  cm −1 \nwith a resolution of 2 cm−1.\nFig. 1 Picture of 500 kV CT composite insulators out of service\nFig. 2 Cracking on the surface part (left) and intact inner part (right) of the CT insulation bushing\nPage 3 of 6\nWang et al. SpringerPlus  (2016) 5:790 \nMechanical properties\nMechanical properties were measured with an \nInstron 5567 (Instron, USA) universal electronic ten -\nsile machine. Dumbbell samples with dimensions of \n25  mm ×  6  mm ×  2  mm were prepared for the tensile \ntests at a tensile rate of 500 mm/min according to GB/T \n528-2009 (similar to ISO 37:2005) standard. The average \nresult of five highest readings at peak load was reported \nas tensile strength. The strain values at the breaking point \nwere used to obtain elongation at break (%). All mechani\n-\ncal values were taken from an average of five samples.\nHardness\nThe Shore A hardness of all the samples were determined \nwith a Shore Hardness Tester (Liuling LX-A, Shanghai, \nChina) according to GB/T 531-2008 (similar to ASTM \nD2240).\nThermo gravimetric analysis (TGA)\nThermal analysis of all the samples was performed with \na TG 209F1 Iris (Netzsch, Germany) thermo gravimetric \nanalyzer. 5–10 mg of test samples were cut from surface \nand inner parts of the silicone rubber insulation bush\n-\ning in different locations. The samples were heated from \n50 to 800 °C at a heat rate of 10 °C/min under a nitrogen \natmosphere with a gas flow rate of 60 mL/min. The rela\n-\ntive mass loss of the samples was recorded.\nResults and discussion\nATR‑FTIR\nBy the aid of attenuated total reflectance Fourier trans -\nform infrared (ATR-FTIR) characterization analysis of \nsilicone rubber insulation bushing samples at differ\n-\nent locations, the change of the molecular structure and \nfunctional groups can be analyzed, especially for the \ncontrast between surface and inner of the material, thus \nthe ageing extent can be judged. FTIR spectra of the sili\n-\ncone rubber CT insulation bushing samples are shown in \nFig.  3. Seen from the spectra, the characteristic absorp\n-\ntion peaks and the corresponding functional groups are \nas follows. The absorption peaks at 3000  cm\n−1 are cor -\nresponded to the stretching vibration of methyl (–CH 3). \nThe peaks at 1255 cm −1 are attributed to Si–CH 3 bond. \nThe strong absorption peaks at 1000–1100  cm −1 are \nascribed to the presence of Si–O–Si. The strong stretch -\ning vibration peaks at 800  cm −1 demonstrate the exist -\nence of Si–(CH 3)2. All these peaks are the characteristic \npeaks of silicone rubber.\nIn Fig.  3, all the absorption peaks at 3000  cm −1 (–\nCH3), 1255  cm −1 (Si–CH 3), 1000–1100  cm −1 (Si–O–\nSi), and 800 cm −1 (Si–(CH 3)2) of the external surface of \nthe silicone rubber insulation bushing are much lower \nthan those of internal ones, proving the reduction of \nSi–O and Si–C bond. In addition, the results reflect \nan important characteristic of the degradation of the \nsilicone rubber insulation bushing: absorption peaks of \nSi–C bond decline much faster than absorption peaks of \nSi–O bond, which demonstrates that the fracture on the \nside-chain groups (mainly Si–(CH\n3)2) are much more \nthan the backbone of the silicone rubber (Chen et  al. \n2015).\nFig. 3 FTIR spectra of the silicone rubber CT insulation bushing \nsamples: a S1 and S2, b S3 and S4, c S5 and S6\nPage 4 of 6Wang et al. SpringerPlus  (2016) 5:790 \nMechanical properties\nChange in mechanical property is one of the most impor-\ntant performances on the material ageing behavior. As a \nkind of organic material, silicone rubber CT insulation \nbushings were exposed to the oxygen, sunlight, UV radia\n-\ntion, high temperature, rain, salt fog, corona discharge, \nand high leakage current, all the factors can accelerate \nthe ageing process of the silicone rubber materials. Their \nmechanical performances will gradually decrease with \nthe service time increasing, and the influence to the sur\n-\nface material is more significant. So tensile strength and \nelongation at break tests are required. The mechanical \nproperties of the silicone rubber CT insulation bushing \nsamples at different parts are listed in Table 1.\nAs shown in Table  1, the tensile strength on the sur\n-\nface parts of the silicone rubber CT insulation bushing \nare significantly lower than those of internal parts. The \nchange in the bottom part is the most obvious. In the \ncase of the bottom part of the silicone rubber CT insu\n-\nlation bushing, the tensile strength decreases remark -\nably from 2.88 to 1.87  MPa when S2 (internal sample) \ncompared with S1 (surface sample). Similarly, the tensile \nstrength decreases from 2.55 to 2.08 MPa when S4 com\n-\npared with S3, and the tensile strength decreases from \n2.66 to 2.60 MPa when S6 compared with S5. The elonga\n-\ntion at break of the silicone rubber CT insulation bushing \nsharply decreases from 267 to 217 % when the compari\n-\nson is made between the internal sample (S2) and surface \nsample (S1). Whereas for S3 compared with S4, and S5 \ncompared with S6, elongation at break values almost do \nnot change. During the ageing course of polymer mate\n-\nrials, chain scission, degradation, and cross-linking reac -\ntions may occur. In general case, tensile strength and \nelongation at break of polymer materials could decline \nafter ageing. In this article, fracture and degradation of \nthe side-chain groups and backbone of the silicone rub\n-\nber result in reduction in tensile strength. When poly -\nmer materials are cross-linked, elongation at break will \nincrease with the improvement of cross-linkage degree. If \nthe degree of cross-linking continues to improve, exces\n-\nsive cross-linking will result in a decline in the elongation \nat break. The elongation at break of S1 is greatly reduced \ncompared with S2, whereas S3 between S4 and S5 \nbetween S6 show little change, which illustrate that the \ndegree of cross-linking of S1 is the maximum. Mechani\n-\ncal test results show that the surface parts of the silicone \nrubber CT insulation bushing have undergone serious \nageing, ageing extent of S1 is the most severe. These \nresults are in accordance with the FTIR results.\nHardness\nShore hardness of the surface and inner of the silicone \nrubber CT insulation bushing were tested, the results are \nshown in Table 2. The hardness of the surface samples have \na certain increase from the internal samples. Especially, \nthe performance of external surface of the bottom part \nis very obvious. Comparison between S1 and S2 results \nshows that the degradation level of Sample S1 is much \nmore serious than that of Sample S2, the Shore A hardness \nof S1 is about 33HA, much higher than that of S2 (25HA), \nwhich demonstrates that the cross-linking degree of S1 is \nrelatively high. The hardness results have proven that the \nsilicone rubber ageing phenomenon occurred mainly on \nthe surface, the cross-linking degrees of the surface parts \nincreased after ageing, along with hardness increased.\nThermo gravimetric analysis\nThermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) approach can effec -\ntively determine the thermal stability of the polymer \nmaterials. One of the most significant performances is \nthe change in thermal decomposition temperature when \nthe molecular structure changes. For the aged material, \nwhose initial decomposition temperature tends to drop, \nthe thermal stability is weakened. TG curves and data of \nthe silicone rubber CT insulation bushing samples are \nshown in Fig. 4 and Table 3.\nAs can be seen from the TG curves of the silicone rub\n-\nber CT insulation bushing samples in Fig.  4, the thermal \ndegradation of silicone rubber system takes two mass \nloss steps. The first step during the temperature range \nfrom 370 to 650  °C is attributed to the thermal decom\n-\nposition of the side-chain groups of the silicone rubber. \nThe other might be ascribed to the thermal degradation \nof the backbone during 650–800 °C. The decomposition \nprocess is characterized by the initial and maximum deg\n-\nradation temperatures, as summarized in Table  3. Tonset \nis the initial decomposition temperature, Tmax is the tem-\nperature of the  maximum  rate  of  decomposition. Below \n420 °C, inner parts of the silicone rubber have not exhib\n-\nited weight loss, indicating that the molecular struc -\nture has not changed and ageing has not happened. For \nthe surface parts of the silicone rubber, decomposition \nbegins from 370 °C, it might be attributed to the thermal \ndegradation of small molecules derived  from side-chain \nTable 1 Mechanical properties test results of  the silicone \nrubber CT insulation bushing samples\nSample Tensile strength (MPa) Elongation \nat break (%)\nS1 1.87 217\nS2 2.88 267\nS3 2.08 261\nS4 2.55 256\nS5 2.60 243\nS6 2.66 236\nPage 5 of 6\nWang et al. SpringerPlus  (2016) 5:790 \ngroups. For instance, Tonset (375.1 °C) and Tmax (425.2 °C) \nof S1 is lower than that of S2 (427.2, 665.2  °C respec -\ntively), indicating that surface parts of the silicone rubber \nhave suffered to ageing worse than the internal samples. \nTable 3 also lists the residues at 800 °C, the values of the \nsurface parts are higher than those of the inner parts. \nThis is because surface parts of the silicone rubber CT \ninsulation bushing have suffered to ageing due to sun \nexposure, ultraviolet radiation, corona discharge, and \nhigh leakage current in 8 years’ service duration. For the \nsurface parts of the silicone rubber CT insulation bush\n-\ning, a certain amount of organic materials had already \nbeen decomposed in long service time, they were lost \nas CO\n2 and H 2O, remaining a large amount of inorganic \nfiller materials in solid state and unchanged on heating. \nSo the weight loss of surface parts in TG analysis should \nbe smaller. Also TGA results are consistent with the \nresults of mechanical properties and FTIR analysis.\nConclusion\nIn this paper, the aging performances of the silicone rub -\nber CT insulation bushing which has been in service for \n8  years from a 500  kV AC substation were analyzed by \nFTIR, mechanical experiments, hardness, and TGA. \nThe results show that the external surface of the silicone \nrubber CT insulation bushing has seriously aged, the \nmolecular structure changed, strength declined, surface \nhardness increased, and thermo stability declined. This \nstudy can provide valuable basis for evaluating aging \nmechanism and aging degree of the silicone rubber insu\n-\nlation bushing in electric power field.\nTable 2 Shore A hardness of the silicone rubber CT insulation bushing samples\nSample S1 S2 S3 S4 S5 S6\nShore hardness (HA) 33 25 26 26 27 26\nFig. 4 TG curves of the silicone rubber CT insulation bushing sam-\nples: a S1 and S2, b S3 and S4, c S5 and S6\nTable 3 Thermo gravimetric analysis data of  the silicone \nrubber CT insulation bushing samples\nSample Tonset (°C) Tmax (°C) Residue \nat 800 °C (%)\nS1 375.1 425.2 83.80\nS2 427.2 665.2 72.70\nS3 375.3 438.1 83.40\nS4 427.6 664.1 73.47\nS5 375.6 436.1 84.85\nS6 428.1 664.4 77.89\nPage 6 of 6Wang et al.
