  "abstract": "Accurate seismic ground response analysis is crucial for the design and safety of civil infrastructure and establishing effective mitigation measures against seismic risks and hazards. This is a complex process due to the nonlinear soil properties and complicated underground geometries. As a simplified approach, the one-dimensional wave propagation model, which assumes that seismic waves travel vertically through a horizontally layered medium, is widely adopted for its reasonable performance in many practical applications. This study explores the potential of sequence deep learning models, specifically 1D convolutional neural networks (1D-CNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and transformers, as an alternative for seismic ground response modeling. Utilizing ground motion data from the Kiban Kyoshin Network (KiK-net), we train these models to predict ground surface acceleration response spectra based on bedrock motions. The performance of the data-driven models is compared with the conventional equivalent-linear analysis model, SHAKE2000. The results demonstrate that the deep learning models outperform the physics-based model across various sites, with the transformer model exhibiting the smallest average prediction error due to its ability to capture long-range dependencies. The 1D-CNN model also shows a promising performance, albeit with occasional higher errors than the other models. All the data-driven models exhibit efficient computation times of less than 0.4 s for estimation. These findings highlight the potential of sequence deep learning approaches for seismic ground response modeling.",
