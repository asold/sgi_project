We live in data-driven societies. According to Turner et al. \n(2014) the digital data generated worldwide is now growing and will continue to grow by \n40% each year and into the next decade. This will expand to in clude not only the \nincreasing number of persons connected to the internet, but also the number of connected \ndevices. For instance, from 2013 to 2020, this accumulation of data will grow by a factor \nof 10; that is, from 4.4 trillion gigabytes to 44 trillion. The authors also estimated that \naround 22% of all accumulated data in 2013 wa s suitable for analysis through the use of \nanalytical tools. This is in contrast with the 35% which is expected to be reached by \n2020, mostly due to the growth of data generated from embedded systems that are \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   Influence of personal values and the adoption of analytical tools 39    \n \n    \n \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n       \n \nfocused on managing real time applications. We find it interesting that the owners of \nnearly 80% of this ‘digital universe’ will be private companies, like Google, Twitter and \nFacebook. In this respect, the countries’ governments will be required to introduce \nregulations, in order to successfully cope w ith such issues as privacy, security and \ncopyrights. \nFrom this perspective, it is clear that traditional decision-making approaches, which \nare fundamentally based on subjective informa tion, are becoming insufficient for dealing \nwith this increasing complexity. Senior mana gers should dip into different analytical \napproaches to make the most of the data available. The greatest challenge during the next \n10 years will be to find new approaches on how to extract relevant information from the \ndata available in order to make better decisions. Competitive advantages will be given to \norganisations that are capable of extracting information from the data available and that \nwill make better decisions based on this quantitative evidence. Several factors could \ninfluence managers on whether or not to adopt new analytical tools. The degree of access \nto financial, technical and human resources are critical variables when deciding whether \nto adopt new analytical tools. The extent of support received by senior managers is \nanother critical variable. Personal values might also be considered as drivers for \nexpanding the use of analytical tools. \nIn terms of literature about the adoption of analytical tools, it is a fact that most \nresearch is focused on investigating its quantitative and structured aspects; that is, the \nquantitative dimensions of the analytical t ools as the amount of access to financial, \ntechnological and financial resources are widely discussed by Hoerl and Snee (2010), \nAnderson-Cook et al. (2012), Deming (2000), Steinberg et al. (2008), Davenport and \nHarris (2007), Gardner (2004), CMMI (2013), Davenport, Harris and Morrison (2010) \nand others. The impact of such qualitative variables as the type of leadership, managerial \nfunctions or personal values has received le ss attention from resear chers. Consequently, \nthe investigation of how personal values impact the adoption of new analytical tools \nrepresents a novel contribution to the field of business analytics. Given this, the main \nobjective of this paper is to quantify how personal values (or managerial functions) \ninfluence the adoption of new anal ytical tools. To answer this, our article is structured in \nsix sections. First, we present a review of the literature regarding values and analytical \ntools, followed by the methodology and our re search objectives. The results, which were \nobtained through our laddering analysis are explained in section four; and then a set of \npractical guidelines is presented for stakeholders who are interested in expanding the use \nof analytical tools. And finally, the last section presents a discussion. \n2 Personal values and the adoption of analytical tools \nPersonal values have been investigated since ancient times. Raz et al. (2003) documents \nthe teachings of Socrates and Aristotle which included some basic definitions of personal \nvalues and their relation to human behaviour. Rokeach (1973) widely discusses the role \nof personal values as a critical factor of the human being, influencing ones decisions, \nchoices and evaluations. Rokeach defines personal values in the following way: \n \n \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   40 I.B. Torres et al.    \n \n    \n \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n       \n \n“To say that a person has a value is to say that he has an enduring prescriptive \nor proscriptive belief that a specific mode of behaviour or end-state of \nexistence is preferred to an opposite m ode of behaviour or end-state. This \nbelief transcends attitudes toward objects and toward situations; it is a \nstandard that guides and determines action, attitudes toward objects and \nsituations, ideology, presentations of self to others, evaluations, judgments, \njustifications, comparisons of self with others, and attempts to influence others. \nValues serve as adjustive, ego-defe nsive, knowledge, and self-actualising \nfunctions” (Rokeach, 1973, p. 25). \nEngland (1967), on the other hand, investigates connections amongst personal values, \nsocial norms and emotions for the purpose of revealing the impact of values on decision \nmaking. Personal values are a priority and the first option when a decision is made by the \nindividual. Consider the following example: if a decision has to be made regarding the \nuse of analytical tools, a particular senior manager will review his or her personal values \nas the first option. Later, she or he will gath er all the information required for reaching a \n‘well-matched’ decision with his or her person al values. Hemingway and Maclagan \n(2004) states that personal values are a sort of heuristic  device for making decisions. \nPersonal values may function as a determin ant factor when deci ding about corporate \nstrategy, the vision statement or even the adoptio n of new analytical tools. In this case, if \nthe values of a particular senior manager include honesty, integrity and commitment, then \nthe essence of those personal values will influence the corporate strategy and the mission \nstatement at the organisational level. \nAs for the empirical research which inve stigates the role of personal values on \nbusiness management, Johnson, Melin and Whittington (2003) conducted a study to find \nout how daily operations and personal values impact a company’s strategic planning \nprocess. von Krogh, Ichijo and Nonaka (2000) described the relationship between the \nknowledge-creation process and senior manager values. Hoerl and Snee (2010) affirm \nthat there is a direct tie between the level of adoption of an analytical tool and the \nperceived degree of its usefulness. Senior managers first perceive that analytical tools add \nvalue to the organisation, and then they decide to adopt them. The higher the perception \nof an analytical tool as useful, the greater the probability that it will be adopted. From this \nperspective, the question then is: What type of managerial functions have a positive \ninfluence on a manager’s perception of the usefulness of analytical tools? To answer this \nwe must use quantitative research methods that can uncover hidden and unstructured \naspects of personal values. In addition to this, research on how personal values may \ninfluence the level of adoption of analytical tools for better decision making is also \nrequired. Our research methods are explained in detail in the following sections. \n3 The methodology \n3.1 The laddering technique \nApplication of laddering methodology to the field of business management was first \nproposed by Reynolds and Gutman (1988). From the very beginning, it proved to be a \npowerful tool for eliciting personal values in different areas such as marketing, \nmanagement and research surveys, among others. This methodology offers several \nbenefits such as, for example, it allows anal ysing relations between the values of two or \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   Influence of personal values and the adoption of analytical tools 41    \n \n    \n \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n       \n \nmore individuals and the variable of interest, which in our case is the level of adoption of \nanalytical tools. Three specific objectives were formulated for this research, as follows: \n• conduct 10 in-depth interviews with senior managers, consultants and academics, in \norder to obtain information about their personal values and the level of adoption of \nanalytical tools \n• apply the laddering methodology to identify those personal values (or managerial \nfunctions) that influence managers in their adoption of new analytical tools \n• provide practical guidelines to stakeholders who are interested in expanding the use \nof analytical tools. \nHerrmann, Huber and Braunstein (2000) reported that the laddering technique was first \ndeveloped by psychologists during the 1960s, as a tool to investigate patients’ values. \nThe technique offered several advantages in comparison with other interviewing \ntechniques; such as, it is relatively simple to implement and understand, and its capacity \nto generate ‘ easy to read ’ results. Consequently, the laddering technique was rapidly \nadapted to other areas, such as marketing, human resources and business management. \nThe laddering technique was incorporated in the discipline of marketing by Reynolds and \nGutman (1984). During this adaptation, the means-end theory, which describes the \nlinkages between personal values and behaviour, was also incorporated. According to \nReynolds and Gutman (1988), the term ‘laddering’ within the context of market research \nrefers to an in-depth, one-on-one interview technique, which is applied to understand how \ncustomers transform attributes of any given product or service into meaningful \nassociations with respect to self by following the means-end theory. \nThat is to say, information about products or services is given within a certain \ncontext, then the individual forms a conception on the degree of suitability (the means) \nwhich is able to complete that product or se rvice, in order to satisfy a specific personal \nneed (the end). Basically, it is possible to apply the means-end theory to describe the way \nthe customers give consequences and assign importance to any given product or service. \nAs stated by Reynolds and Gutman (1988), the context generally affects the importance \nassigned by the customer. For example, in times of economic crisis, customers who see \ntheir incomes reduced may consider avoiding going to clubs and casinos or buying luxury \ngoods. Figure 1 offers a visual representation of the means-end model. \nGutman (1982) states that values related to enjoyment, social recognition and good \nhealth play a decisive role in attaching im portance to their respective consequences. For \ninstance, the value ‘ social recognition’ is related to ‘financial independence’; thus, the \nlatter will have attached a consequence rated as important. But how can personal values \nand their consequences be uncovered? A novel contribution of this research is use of the \nladdering technique to find values that are relevant to the adoption of new analytical tools \nby an organisation. This research is also pertinent given the dearth of documented cases \nin literature regarding use of the laddering technique in the field of business analytics. \nThe operationalisation of laddering proposed by Reynolds and Gutman (1988) \nincludes a format that uses a series of directed questions such as ‘Why is that important to \nyou?’, where the ultimate objective is to uncover the connections between the key \nperceptual elements of attributes (A), consequences (C) and values (V). In this way, \ndifferent levels of abstraction, represented by the assembled ladders, provide a deeper \nunderstanding of how the manager’s perception of the adoption of new analytical tools is \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   42 I.B. Torres et al.    \n \n    \n \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n       \n \nprocessed from what could be called an emotional perspective. Figure 2 illustrates three \nlevels of abstraction with the form attributes (A), consequences (C) and values (V). \nFigure 1 The means-end model (see online version for colours) \n \nSource: Adapted from Herrmann and Braunstein (2000) \nFigure 2 Example of ladder constructed with data collected during our in-depth interviews  \n(see online version for colours) \n \n \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   Influence of personal values and the adoption of analytical tools 43    \n \n    \n \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n       \n \nAn important feature of the laddering technique  is the capacity to cause the responder to \nthink critically about his or her personal motivations, by gradually moving him or her \nforward to higher levels of abstractions; begi nning with the attributes and finishing with \nthe personal values. Once the eliciting process is finished, data collected from multiple \nresponders can be summarised in what is calle d the implication matrix (IM). This matrix \nis relevant because it allows us to identify the most dominant connections with the form \n(A)Æ(C)Æ(V). It is also an input for other anal ysis instruments. The hierarchical value \nmap (HVM), which is assembled based on the implication matrix, is a type of cognitive \nmap with all the connections graphically represented. In this research, the HVM \ninterpretation allows us to understand which personal values are relevant when deciding \nto adopt new analytical tools. Another HVM contribution to this research is its ability to \ndifferentiate the most relevant managerial functions for the adoption of new analytical \ntools, not only by attributes but also by disclosing how the adoption of these new \nanalytical tools in itself delivers higher cons equences, and finally, its relevance in terms \nof personal values. This understanding of personal values might be used as the foundation \nfor developing strategies to adapt data-driven strategies. \n3.2 In-depth interviews through the laddering technique \nAccording to Reynolds and Gutman (1988), some conditions are indispensable in the \ninterview environment in order to obtain valuable data. First, a friendly atmosphere must \nbe created to make the responder feel confid ent and willing to be introspective, to look \ninside and search for feelings and motivations. It is advisable that the interviewer provide \nsome introductory comments, stating that ther e are no right or wron g answers. This will \nmake the responder feel relaxed. The interviewer should insist that the main purpose of \nthe in-depth interview is to talk about perceptions, feelings and notions, completely free \nof judgments. The responder should be viewed as an expert on the topic in discussion. \nThe interviewer should always keep in mind that the ultimate objective of the interview is \nto understand the way in which the responder, based on his feelings and motivations, \nperceives the use of analytical tools. It is also important that the interviewer act merely as \nfacilitator of this self-discovery process and all personal opinions and judgments must be \navoided. The strategy suggested by Reynolds and Gutman (1988) is to begin with the \nquestions that may seem obvious, very simple or even stupid so that the respondent \nhopefully feels more confident and more willing to talk. It is also advisable that the \nrespondent speak most of the time and the interviewer remain silent. \nTable 1 presents six methods for eliciting th e responder’s emotions and feelings. The \nreader may find it difficult to distinguish one from another, since they are pretty similar. \nAccording to Herrmann, Huber and Braunstein (2000), an effective and in-depth \nladdering interview should include the combination of all the methods presented. Plenty \nof experience and knowledge from the interv iewer is required in order to intelligently \napply any specific method to any specific individual. For Reynolds and Gutman (1988), \nthe key is: the more familiar the interviewer is with the methods presented in Table 1, the \nbetter he or she will be able to manage, combine and integrate them. The main topic \nthroughout the interview must be the person (not the service, the idea, the concept or the \nproduct). \n \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   44 I.B. Torres et al.    \n \n    \n \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n       \n \nTable 1 Common interview techniques used in laddering \nLaddering method Descriptio n Example questions \n1. Evoking any \ngiven situational \ncontext \nIt is feasible to reach a ladder when \nthe respondent thinks about one past \nmoment when he/she interacted with \nthe service, product or concept. \nWhen was the last time you \napplied an analytical tool? \nWhy it was important to you? \n2. Supposing the \nabsence \nAnother method to reach a ladder is \nby asking for feelings and sensations, \nbut given the hypothetical situation \nwhen there is a lack of the service, \nproduct or concept. \nHow do you make a decision if \nyou could not access to \ncomputers and analytical tools? \nWhy this (absence or presence) \nis important to you? \n3. Negative – \ninverse laddering \nSometimes the responder is unable \nto articulate his/her feelings. If this \nis the case, a negative question may \nhelp to clarify responder’s mind \nGiven that situation. What would \nhappen if you don’t use an \nanalytical tool? \n4. Back in time Invite responder to go backward in \ntime is another method to elicit \nfeelings and motivations. \nDo you know how your former \nboss used to apply analytical \ntools to reach a decision? Can \nbriefly explain? \n5. Third person \nexperience \nSometimes the responder will find it \ndifficult to talk about her/his \nexperience. In this case, evoking a \nthird person will stimulate the \nresponder to speak about his/her \nown experience. \nWhat problems are your \ncolleagues struggling due to the \nlack of use in analytical tools? \nWhy do you think that is \nimportant for your colleague? \n6. Redirecting \nmethods: silence, \nrapport and check \nSilence on one part of the interview \nwill be helpful to maintain the \nresponder thinking about feelings \nand motivations. Likewise all the \ntypes of interviews the checking and \nrapport are important. \nRapport in the interviews occurs \nwhen both (respondent and \ninterviewer) feel they are in sync \nand relate each other. Interview \nrapport should include mutual \nattention, positivity and \ncoordination. \nSource: Adapted from Reynolds and Gutman (1988) \nAccording to Reynolds and Gutman (1988), the typical in-depth interview should last \nbetween 60 to 75 minutes. Approximately five to ten ladders can be assembled from each \none. In this research, a total of ten in-depth  interviews were carried out and 84 different \nladders assembled. \n4 Results \nThree types of professionals were intervie wed: consultants, academics and businessmen. \nAll were asked if the interview could be recorded and no one refused. Consequently, the \nsame number of digital records is available for anyone who requests them. After \nreviewing the records carefully, the first anal ysis consisted of classifying all the ideas \npresented in groups according to its closest meaning. For example, the concept “ data \nshould support more accurate decision making” is close in meaning to “data accessibility \nsupports better decision making ” and they were classified in the same group. Similarly \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   Influence of personal values and the adoption of analytical tools 45    \n \n    \n \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n       \n \n“online data facilitates communication ” was found to be related to “ sharing information \nis easier when data is online ”; consequently they were cl assified in the same group \nentitled ‘online data ’. By listening to our digital reco rds six times each, a total of 34 \ngroups were created. The next step was to classify them into the three basic groups:  \n(A)Æ(C)Æ(V). Figure 3 shows the 34 groups of attributes, consequences and values. In \naddition, the frequency for each group is shown in the right column. \nFigure 3 Summary of contents of the in-depth interviews \n \nData from the in-depth interviews was processed and analysed, but always from the \nperspective of how it relates to the main objective of the study: to understand the \nrelationships between the elements. Grunert and Grunert (1995) stat e that a distinctive \nfeature that separates the laddering methodology from other in-depth interview \ntechniques is its capacity for ‘ crossing over ’ the qualitative nature of the in-depth \ninterview by generating quantitative and structured data as the final output. By creating a \nscoring matrix from the ladders it is possible to quantitatively identify dominant \npathways and connections among the key elements. As we will show later, the \nimplication matrix displays the number of times that one concept leads to another. This is \na square matrix which shows size by the number of concepts that we are representing. If \nthe relationship among 34 concepts is analysed , then the matrix will be on the order of \n34 × 34. Based on Reynolds and Gutman (1988), the implication matrix may include two \ntypes of relationships: direct and indirect. Consider the following case as a better \nexplanation of direct relationships. \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   46 I.B. Torres et al.    \n \n    \n \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n       \n \nIn Figure 4 you will note that A →B (autonomy for using data leads to→ stimulate \ncreativity and innovation) is a direct relationship. In the same way, B →C (stimulate \ncreativity and innovation leads to  → use more data for decision making), C →D (use \nmore data for decision making leads to  → achieve goals and objectives), and D →E \n(achieve goals and objectives leads to  → being recognized for society), are all direct \nrelationships. Consequently, direct relationships from the attributes to values are elicited, \nand finally a typical ladder is completed. On the other hand, continuing with the example \nof Figure 4, you will notice that A→C, A→E and C→E are indirect relationships. \nFigure 4 Direct relationships in a typical ladder (see online version for colours) \n \nTable 2 presents the implication matrix. For each row-column presented, the frequency \nindicates the number of times that a row-element directly and indirectly leads to a \ncolumn-element. Numbers are separated by the symbol ‘–’, which is used to differentiate \ndirect from indirect relationships. While the numbers on the left represent direct \nrelationships, those on the right are indirect relationships. For instance, the first attribute \n“data is accessible and support decisions ” (row 1) directly leads to “ improve data \nanalysis” (row 21) 17 times, and only once indirectly (17:01). Similarly, “ staff efficiency \nand motivation” (row 28) leads directly to “ communication and trust ” (row 31) eleven \ntimes and zero indirectly (11:00). \nAfter computing the elements in the implication matrix, now we have to calculate the \ntotals for both direct and indirect relationships in order to identify the most dominant \nrelationships. The consequence ‘improve data analysis’ (row 21) has the biggest number \nof direct connections with the row ‘ add value to stakeholders ’, (29) equal to 18 \nrelationships. The next step is to represent all the identified connections in one ‘ easy-to-\nread’ visual diagram. Reynolds and Gutman (1988) define the HVM as  “A way to \ngraphically represent the most dominant connections. It is a visualisation of the linkages \nacross levels of abstraction, starting with  attributes and finishing with values ”. Based on \nHenneberg et al. (2009), a common approach would be to include all the connections \nwhich are comprised of at least four or more direct relations. Thus, 84 ladders that meet \nthis requirement are represented on the HVM. \n \n \n \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   Influence of personal values and the adoption of analytical tools 47    \n \n    \n \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n       \n \nTable 2 Implication matrix for the adoption of new analytical tools (see online version for \ncolours) \n \n\n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   48 I.B.

Element a ttributes, consequences and values (AÆCÆC) are \nassigned as follows: the lowest levels of abst raction or attributes are presented at the \nbottom of the HVM. In contrast, the highest levels of abstraction or values are found at \nthe top of the map. Note that  black arrows connect elements and indicate the direction of \neach relationship. The numbers in red represent how many times a given element leads to \nanother. \nFigure 5 Hierarchical value map for the adoption of new analytical tools (see online  \nversion for colours) \n \nAs shown in Figure 5, the attribute “ data is accessible and supports decisions ” (1) leads \n17 times to the consequence ‘ improve data analysis ’ (21); likewise it leads 18 times to \nthe value ‘add value to stakeholders’ (29). It also leads 6 times to the value ‘honesty and \ncredibility’ (32), and finally, this leads 14 times to ‘ service to the society ’ (34). Other \nelements are noteworthy for their high frequency in laddering to other elements. Namely, \nthe attribute ‘ standardised procedures ’ (4) leads 11 times to ‘ staff efficiency and \nmotivation’ (28), and 18 times to the element ‘ passion, quality and excellence ’ (33). It \nalso leads 9 times to the value ‘honesty and credibility’ (32) which finally leads 14 times \nto the element ‘serving the society’ (34). \nIt is clear that the value which receives the highest number of relationships is also the \nmost relevant. The attribute ‘ goal setting ’ (3) leads 13 times to the consequence \n‘knowledge of data ’ (24), as well as 7 times to ‘ improving results’ (23), which leads 14 \ntimes to ‘ continuous learning ’ (17), and this 4 times to ‘ distinctive competence ’ (18), \nwhich also leads six times to ‘ lower cost’ (26). This leads five times to ‘ more money’ \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   Influence of personal values and the adoption of analytical tools 49    \n \n    \n \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n       \n \n(27), which also leads 13 times to the value ‘ add value to stakeholders ’ (29), as well as \nsix times to ‘honesty and credibility’ (32), and finally, 14 times to ‘service to the society’ \n(34). The cumulative frequency for this ladder is equal to 82. Therefore, there is \nquantitative evidence to show that there is a relationship between the attribute ‘ goal \nsetting’ and the value ‘serving the society ’ which is equal to 82 direct connections (see \nFigure 6). \nAs mentioned before, our main goal is to disclose quantitative relationships  \nbetween attributes and values, which at first glance may be hidden. Our starting point is \nthe 10 attributes which have the largest number of relationships. These ten attributes \nrepresent more than 90% of the total relationships. A cumulative frequency following the \norder of (A) Æ(C)Æ(V) was calculated for each of them. Table 3 shows the results \nobtained. \nFigure 6 Frequency summary for the ladder starting with the attribute ‘goal setting’  \n(see online version for colours) \n \nThe attributes presented in Table 3 are divided into two groups. The first group  \ngathers values related to personal achievement and individual effort; the second  \ngroup shows values related to social skills and social interaction. The attribute  \n‘goal setting ’ had the biggest cumulative frequency, equal to 212, followed by  \n‘creativity to propose new ideas ’. In the third position was ‘ information outside the \norganisation’. \n \n \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   50 I.B. Torres et al.    \n \n    \n \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n       \n \nTable 3 Table of frequencies for relations among attributes and values (see online  \nversion for colours) \n \n\n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   Influence of personal values and the adoption of analytical tools 51    \n \n    \n \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n       \n \nGiven these results, social values are more  influential when expanding the use of \nanalytical tools than personal achievement values. While around 80% of the relationships \nended with social values, 20% finished wi th personal achievement values. The social \nvalue ‘service to the society ’ had the highest cumulative frequency, equal to 587 or 33% \nof all relationships ending with this value. ‘ Honesty and credibility’ was in second place \nwith a cumulative frequency equal to 465, representing 26% of the total relationships. In \nthird place was ‘added value to the stakeholders ’, with a cumulative frequency of 364, \nrepresenting 21% of total relationships. Note that these three social values concentrate \n80% of total relationships. In fourth place we found the value ‘ being a leader’, with 292 \ndirect relationships, representing 17% of all relationships. These four values concentrate \n97% of the total connections. \nWith regard to attributes, ‘goal setting’ got the highest number of connections, equal \nto 212 or 12% of the total. The ‘creativity to propose new ideas’ was in second place with \n197 connections, representing 11% of the total. In third position is the attribute \n‘information outside the organisation ’ with 191 connections, representing 11% of the \ntotal. The attribute ‘ responding more quickly ’ was ranked in fourth position with 191 \nconnections. These four attributes concentrate 45% of the total outgoing relationships. \n5 Practical guidelines to stakeholders \nThree attributes draw our attention: ‘ goal setting’, ‘creativity to propose new ideas ’ and \n‘getting information from outside ’. On the other hand, we find that another three \nmanagerial functions (or personal values) represent 97% of the total relationships; these \nare: ‘service to the society ’, ‘honesty’ and ‘adding value to the stakeholders ’. At this \npoint, we find that the initial question of how values influence the adoption of new \nanalytical tools is partially answered. In order to fully answer it, the discussion now \ncentres on providing gu idelines to stakeholders who are interested in expanding the use \nof analytical tools. \nWith respect to the attribute ‘ goal setting ’, which is the most influential attribute, \nThompson and McEwen (1958) stated that it is almost impossible for an organisation to \nlast indefinitely if goals are not formulated and deployed. The first suggestion provided \nhere is to formulate and deploy pertinent goals by following well-proven processes. \nShalley (1995) documents best practices to formulate ‘ high impact’ goals. Some of the \nimportant features of ‘high-impact’ goals are also discussed by this author; among them, \nthe capacity to guarantee the long term surviv al of the company and respond properly to \nchanges in the environment. Locke et al. (1990)  suggest that there is a direct relationship \nbetween goal setting and productivity. Goal setting increases productivity when \nindividuals accept and commit to specific challenging goals and receive appropriate \nfeedback. The famous article written by Locke et al. (1981) offers plenty of help to \nstrengthen the goal-setting process. This resource is widely suggested for all our readers. \nAmabile et al. (1996) defines creativity, the second most influential attribute, as the \nproduction of novel and useful ideas on any domain. Creativity is the starting point for \ninnovation and thus for experimentation, which is strategic to expand the use of analytical \ntools. Creative and critical thinking are indispensable in order to generate helpful new \nideas. However, critical thinking might also act as a killer of creativity by discouraging \nthose who propose new ways to solve problems  or to create things. For instance, phrases \nsuch as ‘ Yes, we tried this ’, “No, it won’t work ’ and ‘This doesn’t make any sense ’ \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   52 I.B. Torres et al.    \n \n    \n \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n       \n \ndiscourage the generation of new ideas. That is: “ Before criticising the idea of another, \nyou must first find two valid reasons to support it .” This ratio of two supportive versus \none critical view will reinforce the growth of creative thinking. \nThe last discussed attribute refers to the capacity of ‘ getting information from \noutside’. According to Roome (1992), the ex ternal environment includes all actors \noutside the organisation, such as suppliers, customers, society, governments and \neconomic conditions, etc. It is extremely important to constantly monitor the  \nexternal environment for signals of change in the markets which may require the \nmodification of assumptions used in the models, metrics or methodologies. In this case, \nwe suggest the monitoring process proposed by Ruff (2006) as this classifies efforts to \nmonitor products and services first, and later, the macro-environment formed by markets, \nindustries, and economic and political factors.  Management tools such as FODA, Hoshin \nKanri, the external perspectives of the balanced scorecard, and the five competitive forces \nof Porter, among others, are strongly advised to successfully monitor the external \nenvironment. \nBased on the frequencies found in Table 3, the most influential value (or managerial \nfunction) is ‘serving the society ’. Managers should, in this respect, make sure that the \nfour dimensions proposed by Carroll and Buchholtz (2011) are present in their \norganisations. The first dimension embraces the financial returns that an organisation is \nsupposed to achieve. In the second place, the organisation should be able to follow all \nlaws and regulations. Ethical aspects refer to compliance with moral codes and proper \nconduct, which are expected to be fully respected. Finally, philanthropic responsibility is \nunderstood as the expected behaviour which society finds positive as it promotes and \nreinforces healthy habits. The more an organisation grows in these four dimensions, the \nmore it serves society. \nThe second value discussed here is ‘ honesty’. Becker (1998) defines this as “ the \nrefusal to pretend that facts of reality are other than what they are ”. In other words, \nhonesty is the appreciation of reality as it is. It is clear that honesty has a strategic \nimportance for satisfying customer expectations and thereby achieves a competitive \nadvantage. Levels of honesty are in direct proportion to the morals of the workforce and \ntheir commitment to the goal-setting process. A set of practical guidelines is provided to \nassist the manager with improving honesty. The first suggestion is to lead by example. By \nsetting a moral and ethical standard, senior managers provide a solid reference of what is \nexpected from everyone. Leaders should stress the importance of honesty to suppliers and \ncustomers by stating it clearly in the missi on statement. Open and honest communication \nmust be fomented at all levels of the organi sation. This is an effective way to clear up \nrumours, negativity, or even dishonesty. All stakeholders should be encouraged to voice \ntheir concerns, ideas and even complaints w ithout fear of defensive reactions. As for \n‘adding value to stakeholders’, Porter (2008) widely discusses the role of the customers, \nemployees, shareholders and society in order to create competitive advantages. In this \nrespect, you must explicitly specify what benefits each stakeholder is receiving. \nFigure 7 shows a double effect on the adoption of analytical tools. At the bottom of \nthe organisational structure, the attributes ‘goal setting’, ‘creativity to propose new ideas’ \nand ‘getting information from outside’ influence daily operations, methods and operating \nprocesses of the organisation. At the middle level we find statistical engineering which \nestablishes a link between attributes-&-methods and values-&-strategy. At the top of the \nstructure the values ‘serving the society’, ‘honesty’ and ‘adding value to the stakeholders’ \ninfluence the mission and vision statements (analytical thinking). \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   Influence of personal values and the adoption of analytical tools 53    \n \n    \n \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n       \n \nFigure 7 The influence of values and attributes on the adoption of new analytical tools  \n(see online version for colours) \n \nSource: Adapted from Hoerl and Snee (2010) \nIn short, initiatives to expand the adoption of analytical tools can be divided in two \ngroups. The first focuses on influencing daily operations through an expanded use of \nanalytical tools, namely: \n• improve the goal-setting process \n• stimulate creativity \n• improve the quality and relevance of information from outside. \nOn the other hand, mission and vision statements should be based on solid values. Senior \nmanagers must be the main promoters of managerial functions such as: \n• demonstrate by facts that the organization is adding value to the society \n• ensure that honesty is a big concern in the organisation \n• ensure that expectations of the stakeholders are satisfied. \n6 Discussion \nIn this research, the laddering technique is applied to investigate analytical tools and \nmanagerial functions. First, a general perspective of the contemporary business analytics \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   54 I.B. Torres et al.    \n \n    \n \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n       \n \nenvironment is given. Then, formal definitions for personal values are provided from \nliterature, within the context of management. A broad explanation of the laddering \nmethodology is provided in section three, followed by the results obtained. Considering \nthat we conducted only ten in-depth interviews, our results are intended as more \nillustrative than convincing. In other words, our contribution is more to demonstrate the \nversatility of the laddering technique and its capacity to cross over different disciplines \nrather than to throw compelling evidence on the adoption of analytical tools. Although \nresults are limited in scope and relevance, a set of practical guidelines is provided to \nstakeholders interested in expanding the use of analytical tools in their organisations. Our \nguidelines are complemented by insights from other authors in order to make them more \nhelpful and robust. \nTo this point, it is clear that additional re search is needed to complement our results. \nA follow-up paper will be prepared, in which a second (and larger) set of managers will \nbe asked for their ‘ managerial functions’ and the adoption of new analytical tools. We \nwill propose that a quantitative model be prep ared to test whether we can predict if \nanalytical tools will be adopted or not. In this way, the complete framework will consider \ncontributions in two ways: one methodological, implying a novel use of laddering to \nexamine groups rather than consumers in order to solicit higher order beliefs of other \nkinds; and the second to reveal managerial perceptions of their own multidimensional \nroles and functions. While the first is provided here, the second will be the subject of a \nfollow-up paper. \nHere, we adopted the definition of standard operating procedure proposed by Walsh \nand Ungson (1991) in order to describe our attributes. It is evident that complementary \nresearch is pertinent to investigate what type of managerial functions (or personal values) \nwould derive from different definitions of attributes; such as communication devices, \nassembly lines or office assistants. The point is to identify to what extent managerial \nfunctions are altered when a change is made to  the concept of attributes. Similarly, more \ninvestigation is required on changes in the response variable as a consequence of \ninterviewing different groups. For instance, how do the perceptions of academics, \nmanagers and consultants differ? This may produce other interesting results. \nSince this longstanding technique has been widely applied to derive higher-order \nattributes for brands, its replication in the fi eld of business analytics represents a novel \ncontribution. At the time that this resear ch was conducted, no documented cases of the \nuse of this technique in the field of business analytics were found. \nReferences \nAmabile, T.M., Conti, R., Coon, H., Lazenby, J.  and Herron, M.
