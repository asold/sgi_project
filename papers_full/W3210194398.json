    "abstract": "In this paper, efficient and accurate linear and nonlinear models are proposed for indicating comprehensive health requirements of the transformer using health index (HI) concept. The models are established with 336 experimental datasets including oil characteristics and dissolved gas analysis (DGA) of various types of transformers placed in different areas. The significance of DGA parameters in transformer health condition is considered with the inclusive DGA factor (<italic>DGAF</italic>) parameter, which considers the weighting importance of seven dissolved gases. Nonlinear models used in this paper are artificial neural network (ANN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), which represent the behavior of transformer insulation parameters. The nonlinear models are compared with multiple linear regression (MLR) which is a linear statistical model. The models are established with 80 percent of the experimental dataset. The other 20 percent of data are utilized for the efficiency assessment of the models. The results demonstrate that the models provide an assessment of the health condition of the transformers comparable to existing models with high accuracy. The contributions of this paper are: 1) Evaluating the overall HI of the transformer employing a complete set of 15 input parameters of transformer oil-paper insulation system. 2) Adding <italic>DGAF</italic>, <italic>&#x0025;WaterPaper</italic>, <italic>IFT</italic> parameters and showing the importance of these parameters. 3) Regarding the condition of solid insulation of the transformer particularly. 4) Applying a diverse and large practical dataset composed of 336 different transformers located in different country areas. 5) Using the MLR method for three purposes. 6) Providing linear (MLR) and nonlinear (ANN, ANFIS) models for HI calculation of the dataset, simultaneously. 7) Verifying the applicability and efficiency of the ANFIS model for simulating HI value.",
