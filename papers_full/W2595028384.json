Cronin3 & Daniel B. M. Haun4\nFor the first time, chimpanzees have been observed using tools to clean the corpse of a deceased group \nmember. A female chimpanzee sat down at the dead body of a young male, selected a firm stem of \ngrass, and started to intently remove debris from his teeth. This report contributes novel behaviour to \nthe chimpanzee’s ethogram, and highlights how crucial information for reconstructing the evolutionary \norigins of human mortuary practices may be missed by refraining from developing adequate \nobservation techniques to capture non-human animals’ death responses.\nResults\nSocial tool use is virtually absent in the animal kingdom. Apart from an early report by McGrew & Tutin 1,2, all \naccounts of non-human animal tool use are in the context of individual activities (e.g. refs 3–5). Here, we report \na new case of social tool use in chimpanzees in a very unusual context: grass tool use for dental corpse cleaning.\nNoel, a wild-born female chimpanzee living at the Chimfunshi Wildlife Orphanage Trust in Zambia, attended \nthe dead body of Thomas, a nine-year-old male whom she adopted (sensu 6) when his mother died four years \nearlier. At the time of the reported observations, Noel was 33 years old. She was brought to Chimfunshi when she \nwas 14 years old, after spending most of her life at a private home in former Zaïre. Autopsy revealed that Thomas \nhad most likely died from a combination of a viral and bacterial lung infection (for more details, see ref. 7). The \nmajority of the group visited Thomas’ body at least once\n7, but when most chimpanzees were lured away with \nhighly attractive food, Noel remained at his body and cleaned his teeth with a grass tool. Nina, her adolescent \ndaughter, stayed at her side and observed the cleaning efforts of her mother. In more detail, this unique event \nconsisted of the following actions.\nNoel approached Thomas’ body, sat down close to his head, turned her upper body sideways to select a hard \npiece of grass, put the grass in her mouth, and opened Thomas’ mouth with both of her hands. Then she wrapped \nher fingers around Thomas’ chin and jaw, and used her thumbs to explore his teeth. After 3 sec, she took the grass \nout of her mouth with her right hand, while maintaining focused grip on Thomas’ mouth with her left hand, \nand started to meticulously poke the grass in the same dental area as where her thumbs had been. During this \ntime, Noel kept her face within 10 cm of Thomas’ face, never deflecting her gaze from his mouth. After 26 sec \nof teeth cleaning with the grass, Noel brought the grass to her mouth and inspected the grass orally, seemingly \ntasting debris removed from Thomas’ mouth. Soon thereafter, Noel engaged in cleaning Thomas’ teeth with the \nsame piece of grass a second time (at least for 5 sec, until the caretakers requested for the recording to end – see \nMethods), tasting the debris once more (see Figs 1 and 2, and Supplementary Videos 1 and 2).\nDiscussion\nWe consider the cleaning of a corpse’s teeth by Noel noteworthy for several reasons. First and foremost, to date, \nthis behaviour has never been reported in chimpanzees or any other non-human animal species. The records of \nsocial tool use in animals are limited to McGrew & Tutin’s\n1,2 descriptions of dental cleaning in live chimpanzees. \nMcGrew & Tutin reported how chimpanzees cleaned and even extracted their own and each other’s teeth – an \nunprecedented behavioural phenomenon in non-human animals that the authors related to the chimpanzees’ \nexperience with object manipulation and their intimate social relationships\n2. The current report extends these \nobservations to dental cleaning of a dead conspecific and corroborates McGrew & Tutin’s perspective on the pre-\nconditions of this unusual social behaviour in the form of Noel’s intimate relationship with Thomas.

In fact, \nwhereas the limited documentations of chimpanzees’ responses in death-related situations range from passive \nbehaviours like resting, to active behaviours like dragging and slapping the dead body9, gentle corpse handling in \nform of tool-assisted dental cleaning (see Supplementary Videos 1 and 2) has never been reported and warrants \nscientific interest both from an intraspecific and comparative point of view 8. In particular, the reported corpse \nhandling in chimpanzees may suggest that chimpanzees have evolved in complex social organizations condu -\ncive to the emergence of post-mortem affiliation 10. In other words, chimpanzees may form long-lasting social \nbonds (e.g. see refs 11 and 12) that continue to influence their behaviour once the bonding partner has died. Like \nhumans, chimpanzees may not treat deceased conspecifics carelessly, but instead handle corpses in a socially \nFigure 1. Tool use for corpse cleaning in chimpanzees. A female chimpanzee named Noel (a) approached \nThomas’ body, (b) turned sideways to select a hard piece of grass, (c) held the grass in her mouth while opening \nThomas’ mouth with both of her hands, and (d) cleaned Thomas’ teeth using the grass.\nFigure 2. Hand-tool dexterity. Depicted is the way by which Noel held her hands and the grass tool in relation \nto Thomas’ mouth while cleaning his teeth.\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n3\nScientific  REPORTs  | 7:44091 | DOI: 10.1038/srep44091\nmeaningful way – i.e. as social beings instead of inanimate objects – especially when this group member is a close \nassociate, as in the reported case13. An alternative, non-mutually exclusive explanation for the reported behaviour \nmay be that it emerged from a motivation to learn about death, perhaps fuelled by a curiosity about the unique \ncircumstances\n14. Second, in over 8000 hours of observing the chimpanzees at Chimfunshi, including Noel, we \nhave not observed a single bout of a chimpanzee engaging in tool-assisted teeth cleaning. Notwithstanding the \nreports by McGrew & Tutin\n1,2, this indicates that Noel engaged in a rather unique and meaningful social activity, \nall the more given that she forfeited abundant high quality food by doing so (i.e. the caretakers tried to lure the \nchimpanzees away from the body so it could be removed from the enclosure). The fact that Noel preferred to stay \nclose to Thomas over traveling to the high-quality food being offered by the caretakers furthermore casts doubt \non the interpretation that Noel cleaned Thomas’ teeth merely to obtain food.\nAnecdotal evidence needs to be treated cautiously\n15. However, given the availability of high-quality video \nfootage, we present a valid case of unique non-human animal behaviour which could shed light on the evolution \nof behaviours that are believed to be typically human. Death responses represent core features of human civiliza-\ntion, with great diversity in mortuary rites found across cultures\n16. In general, for animals critically depending on \ngroup living17, like humans and chimpanzees, responding to death may be a means to reorganize the social unit, \nespecially when so-called “brokers” die: individuals who play an important role in maintaining group cohesion by \nconnecting sub-groups\n18,19. Unfortunately, accounts of dying animals and the responses of their dependents and \nother group members to their (impending) death are virtually absent from scientific records due to lack of close \nobservation and lack of interest in publishing case studies. The current report on dental corpse cleaning in chim-\npanzees warrants focused efforts in developing more sophisticated observation techniques to critically capture \nnon-human animals’ (social) behaviour in death-related situations and contributes new behaviour to consider \nwhen investigating the evolutionary origins of human death responses.\nMethods\nThe responses of group members to finding the dead body of Thomas were recorded with two video cameras from \nthe moment that Thomas’ body was discovered until the caretakers requested for the recording to end so that they \ncould make an attempt to climb the fence and retrieve the body from the enclosure. The recording comprised \n20 min of uninterrupted filming and was previously used to investigate the group’s responses to the dead body \nin terms of proximity and individual differences based on association history with the deceased\n7. In the current \nreport, we focused on one peculiar behaviour during the group’s response to Thomas’ dead body – tool use for \ncorpse cleaning – in order to significantly expand the chimpanzee’s ethogram\n20, and highlight how we may miss \nout on crucial information for reconstructing the evolutionary origins of human mortuary practices by refraining \nfrom developing adequate observation techniques to capture non-human animals’ death responses\n21. We inferred \nfrom independent interviews with local caregivers (> 4 years working with the same chimpanzees) and personal \nobservations by the lead author during a 4-mon period in 2007 that Noel had adopted Thomas by measures of \nclose association, co-feeding (especially during competitive feeding sessions, i.e. the distribution of small portions \nof high quality food) and co-traveling to nesting sites. All methods were carried out in accordance with the Pan \nAfrican Sanctuary Alliance guidelines and Chimfunshi Wildlife Orphanage Trust regulations. The research was \nnon-invasive and complied with the ethical guidelines of the Chimfunshi Wildlife Orphanage Trust.\nReferences\n1. McGrew, W . C. & Tutin, C. E. G. Chimpanzee dentistry.
