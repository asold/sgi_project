INTRODUCTION\nNowadays, the requirement of dual-band operation for RF system\nis obviously increased with the trend of multiband applications in\nnew technologies of wireless communication systems. For composing\ncompact and low-cost multiband systems, multiband components and\ncircuits are needed. The power ampliﬁers are the key part in the\ntransmitter for mobile communication systems.\nTo achieve practical structures for this kind of circuits, a number\nof dual-band matching methods have been published [1–14]. Orfanidis\nReceived 20 July 2012, Accepted 29 August 2012, Scheduled 9 September 2012\n* Corresponding author: Shun Li (libukun@gmail.com).\n196 Li et al.\npresented dual-band transformers with Chebysheve response in [1].\nMonzon proposed a small two-section transformer to deal with any\ntwo uncorrelated frequencies [2]. Wu et al. extended a two-section\ntransformer to deal with a load of equal complex impedance at\ntwo frequencies [3]. Liu et al. presented a dual-band transformer\nusing a three-section transmission line [4]. A compact Pi-structure\ntransformer operating at arbitrary dual band is proposed in [5] by Wu.\nIn [6], a modiﬁed shunt-stub dual-band impedance transformer was\nused to achieve matching a load with diﬀerent complex impedances\nat two frequencies to a real impedance source by Chuang. Wu et\nal. discusses the situation where both source and load impedances\nare complex and frequency dependent in [7]. Recently, many novel\nmatching techniques have been proposed to improve the performance\nof the dual-band matching [8–14]. However, these existing dual-band\nmatching techniques in [1–14] can not realize dual-band matching at\ntwo relatively closed operating frequencies (n = f2/f1 ≤ 1.2) in a\nsmall circuit area because of their complex structure. Besides, The\napplication of coupled-line was extensively investigated recently [15–\n21].\nIn the light of these issues, this paper presents a new dual-\nband matching technique, which uses the dual-band coupled-line\ntransformer approach. The proposed dual-band matching technique\ncan realize matching arbitrary complex impedance to arbitrary\ncomplex impedance at any two arbitrary frequencies, as well as at two\nrelatively closed operating frequencies (n = f2/f1 ≤ 1.2), and occupy a\nvery small circuit area. The proposed design methodology requires the\nuse of a novel dual-band impedance transformer, which has diﬀerent\nelectronic length at two operating frequencies. This transformer\ningenious uses the characteristics of coupled-line in a unique way to\nrealize dual-band complex impedance matching. To the best of the\nauthors’ knowledge, this circuit has never been used explicitly to\nrealize a dual-band impedance transformer with two diﬀerent complex\nimpedances at two diﬀerent operating frequencies.\nIt is very interesting that this novel dual-band transformer can also\nbe used in dual-band passive circuit design. This paper focuses on using\nthe proposed transformer to transform 50 Ω impedance to the ideal load\nimpedances of the transistor at two frequency bands. To validate the\nproposed methodology, the matching circuits are designed to match\n50 Ω to the ideal load impedances obtained from source-pull and load-\npull data of a 30 W gallium nitride (GaN)-based device (CGH27030\nin Cree [22]) using Agilent’s Advanced Design System at two designed\nfrequency simultaneously. These matching circuits are further used in\nthe design of 30 W dual-band class-AB PA for Global System for Mobile\nProgress In Electromagnetics Research, Vol. 131, 2012 197\nCommunications (GSM) and Wideband Code Division Multiple Access\n(WCDMA) at 1800 and 2140 MHz, respectively.\n2. DESIGN METHODOLOGY\nAs shown in Figure 1, this matching network conﬁguration is\nfundamentally based on extending the single-band coupled-line\ntransformer, which is an arbitrary complex impedance transformer\nfrom [23], to dual-band application.\nIn this design, the key element of this network is a coupled-\nline attached with two dual-band/dual-susceptance parts at its across\nterminals. The coupled-line has even- and odd-mode characteristic\nimpedances Z0e, Z0o and electrical lengthθ1 at the ﬁrst band center\nfrequency, f1. Then, it has corresponding even- and odd-mode\ncharacteristic impedances Z0e and Z0o, and electrical lengθ2 at the\nsecond band center frequencyf2. The two dual-band/dual-susceptance\nparts present two diﬀerent susceptances jXT11, jXT12 and jXT21,\njXT22 at f1 and f2, respectively. Due to these dual-band operating\ncharacteristic, the proposed dual-band matching network can realize\nan impedance transformation from ZL to two arbitrary complex\nimpedances, Zin1 and Zin2 at f1 and f2, respectively. The methodology\nwill be explained in the following section.\n1\n2 3\n4\nI\nO\nZ0e ,Z0o , 1 @ f1\nZ0e ,Z0o , 2 @ f2\njXT11 @ f1\njXT12 @ f2\njXT21 @ f1\njXT22 @ f2\nZin1 @ f1\nZin2 @ f2\nZ L\nZS\nθ\nθ\nFigure 1. The circuit model of the proposed dual-band matching\nnetwork.\n198 Li et al.\n2.1. Coupled-line Transformer\nAt each operate frequency, the proposed dual-band coupled-line\nimpedance transformer can be equivalent to a single-band coupled-\nline impedance transformer. The single-band coupled-line impedance\ntransformer has been analyzed in [23]. Figure 2 shows the\ngeneralized circuit conﬁguration of the proposed single-band coupled-\nline impedance transformer. It consists of an arbitrary-length coupled-\nline section (Z0e, Z0o, θ) and two reactive elements (jXT1, jXT2). Five\ndesign parameters (Z0e, Z0o, θ, jXT1, jXT2) exist in this proposed\nmatching structure, resulting in the wide range of matched source and\nload impedances (ZS = RS + jXS, ZL = RL + jXL), various available\nsolutions, and a compact size.\nIf the values ofZ0e, Z0o, θ are manually determined, other two\nparameters jXT1, jXT2 can be calculated by closed-form equations.\nThe analytical design expressions, and the achieved results are\n\n\n\nXT1 = C1 + C3 + √2C2\nC4\n,\nXT2 = C5 + C6 + √2C2\nC7\n,\n(1a)\n\n\n\nXT1 = C1 + C3 − √2C2\nC4\n,\nXT2 = C5 + C6 − √2C2\nC7\n,\n(1b)\nwhere C1–C7 were interim parameters calculated fromZ0e, Z0o, θ, ZS,\nZL [23]. The values ofZ0e, Z0o, θ can be freely chosen whenC2 ≥ 0 is\nsatisﬁed.\n1\n2 3\n4\nI\nO\nZ0e , Z0o , jXT2Zin\nZL\nZS\njXT1\nθ\nFigure 2.The circuit model of the single-band coupled-line impedance\ntransformer from [23].\nProgress In Electromagnetics Research, Vol. 131, 2012 199\nTo make this coupled-line transformer satisfy dual-band applica-\ntion requirements, these parameters should be considered in two fre-\nquency bands. When the parametersZ0e, Z0o, θ1 are determined at\nthe ﬁrst frequency f1, these parameters are turned to beZ0e, Z0o,\nθ2 = nθ1(n = f2/f1) at the second frequencyf2. After that, the param-\neters XT1, XT2 can also be calculated by closed-form Equations (1a)\nand (1b) atf1 and f2 when the design equations in [23] are considered.\nIn respect to that the total calculation is based on analytical formu-\nlas, and the design theory of the proposed coupled-line transformer is\ndirect and accurate.\n2.2. Dual-band/Dual-susceptance Stub\nThe next step in the matching network design is to obtain the\ncalculated parametersXT1, XT2 by using dual-band/dual-susceptance\nstubs, as shown in Figure 3.\nThe dual-band/dual-susceptance stub is realized by open-circuit\ntransmission lineT1 or short-circuit transmission lineT2. Each of them\nhas its own electronic length at two diﬀerent operating frequencies, so\nthat they can present diﬀerent susceptances at two diﬀerent operating\nfrequencies seen into from pointA. The choice of using either open-\ncircuit line or short-circuit line in order to realize dual-band/dual-\nsusceptance stub depends on the realization of it with a minimum\nstub length.\nTo satisfy the demand of the dual-band coupled-line impedance\ntransformer, the result of the ﬁrst dual-band/dual-susceptance stub\nshould be as follows:{ZT1(f1) =jX1 = jXT11 @f1\nZT1(f2) =jX2 = jXT12 @f2\n, (2a)\n()\n11\n1\n22\n@\n@\nT\njX fZf jX f\n     =      \n()\n11\n2\n22\n@\n@\nT\njXfZf jXf\n     =      \n1T Z f1 1,θ1@ 2T Z f2 2,θ2@\n(a) (b)\nFigure 3. Proposed dual-band/dual-susceptance stub. (a) Open-\ncircuit, (b) short-circuit.\n200 Li et al.\nAnd the second dual-band/dual-susceptance stub should be as follows:{ZT2(f1) =jX1 = jXT21 @f1\nZT2(f2) =jX2 = jXT22 @f2\n. (2b)\nwhere X1, X2 can be positive or negative, depending on the required\nsusceptance value calculated from (1a) and (1b).XT11, XT12, XT21,\nXT22 are the calculated parameters shown in Figure 1. In the following\nsubsection, the use of the open-circuit transmission line and short-\ncircuit transmission line for the design of such a dual-band/dual-\nsusceptance stub are discussed.\nT1 is an open-circuit transmission line which has characteristic\nimpedance Z1 and electrical length θ1 at the ﬁrst frequency. The\nimpedance of the open-circuit transmission line seen into from pointA\ncan be obtained by transmission line impedance equation as follow [24]:\nZT1(f1) =−jZ1 cot θ1 @f1. (3)\nwhen it works at the second operating frequencyf2, it has the same\ncharacteristic impedanceZ1 and physical length with the situation of\nit works at the ﬁrst operating frequencyf1. Thus, the impedance of\nthe open-circuit transmission line seen into from pointA at the second\noperating frequency turned to be:\nZT1(f2) =−jZ1 cot nθ1 @f2, (4)\nwhere n is the frequency ration = f2/f1 greater than 1. Thus, the\nmain goal is to obtain the design parametersZ1 and θ1 as illustrated in\nFigure 3(a). Equations (3) and (4) can be solved simultaneously using\ngraphical methods or numerical techniques to obtain the values ofZ1\nand θ1. The obtained value ofθ1 is assumed atf1, furthermore we can\nuse it to calculate the physical length of the open-circuit transmission\nline. Once these parameters for the open-circuit transmission line are\nknown, the design parameters for the dual-band/dual-susceptance stub\ncan be easily determined.\nIn the same way, the design parameters for the short-circuit\ntransmission lineT2 can be determined from the following equations:\nZT2(f1) = jZ2 tan θ2 @f1, (5)\nZT2(f2) = jZ2 tan nθ2 @f2. (6)\nThe last step of the dual-band coupled-line impedance transformer\ndesign is attaching two dual-band/dual-susceptance stubs to the two\nacross ports of coupled-line, as shown in Figure 4. When the two\ncross-ports of coupled-line have corresponding reactive load at the\ntwo operating frequencies, the remaining two ports will realize the\nrequired impedance transformation fromZL to Zin1 @f1 and Zin2 @f2.\nAfter that, the required dual-band impedance matching network can\nbe implemented ﬁnally.\nProgress In Electromagnetics Research, Vol. 131, 2012 201\nZS\nZ0e, Z0o, 1 @ f1\nZ0e, Z0o, 2 @ f2\njXT11 @ f1\njXT12 @ f2\njXT 21 @ f1\njXT22 @ f2\nZin1 @ f1\nZin2 @ f2\nZL\nZload 1 @ f1\nZload 2 @ f2\nθ\nθ\nFigure 4.

EXPERIMENT\nBased on the proposed methodology, a dual-band matching circuit is\nrealized for matching speciﬁc complex impedances to a 50 Ω load. The\nvalues of the complex impedances to be matched are obtained from\nthe source-pull and load-pull analysis of a stabilized GaN based device\n(CGH27030 from Cree), which is biased at a drain voltage and current\nof 28 V and 150 mA, respectively, as listed in Table 1. The source-\npull and load-pull data are based on obtaining optimal PAE at the\ntwo frequencies of 1800 MHz and 2140 MHz. The design methodology\nof dual-band matching network is validated by designing input and\noutput matching networks for a class-AB power ampliﬁer.\n3.1. Matching Network Design\nFor presenting the ideal source and load impedance to the transistor,\nthe coupled-line impedance transformers need to match 50 Ω load to\nthe desired impedances listed in Table 1. The input and output\nmatching circuits are designed on a Rogers’ RO4350B substrate which\nhas a dielectric constant of 3.48, a substrate thickness of 0.76 mm and\na tangent of dielectric loss angle of 0.003.\n202 Li et al.\nPort 1\nPort 2\nFigure 5.

It can additionally provide a convenient bias insertion\npoint, if the RF short is made using a suitable bypass capacitor [25].\nSo a short-circuit quarter-wave transmission line which is calculated\nat the middle frequency off1 and f2 has been used in the present\napplication as DC feed. The characteristic impedance of this quarter-\nwave transmission line is chosen as 50 Ω and the short-circuit is realized\nby two capacitances which resonates atf1 and f2, respectively. The\ntransistor is stabilized using paralleled resistance and capacitance at\nits input and a resistance at its gate DC feed circuit.\nWhen use the dual-band coupled-line transformer to match the\nload-pull impedance to 50 Ω directly, output matching network results\nin high-impedance lines which is diﬃcult to realize accurately with the\nauthors’ fabrication facility. As a result, we add an L-type transformer\nto transform the load-pull impedance to intermediate impedance which\nis easy to realize accurately with the authors’ fabrication facility, as\nlisted in Table 1.\nThe corresponding physical design parameters of the ampliﬁer are\nlisted in Table 4. Make the appropriate adjustments of the direction\nof these transmission lines in the circuit to avoid unwanted coupling\nbetween them and obtain a smaller circuit size. The size of the input-\nand output-matching networks are 26 mm×30 mm and 26 mm×24 mm,\nrespectively. Matching circuit is the largest part of the power ampliﬁer\nmodule, so the miniaturization of the matching circuit can greatly\nreduce the size of the power ampliﬁer module. The overall size of the\ndesigned class-AB PA is 63 mm× 57 mm. If the DC feed transmission\nProgress In Electromagnetics Research, Vol. 131, 2012 205\nFigure 7.

The photograph of the fabricated dual-band power\nampliﬁer is shown in Figure 7.\n4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nTo validate the matching capability of the designed matching network,\nwe terminate it with a 50 Ω impedance load and measure another port’s\nreturn loss and test the performance of the dual-band PA which is\nmatched by the proposed matching network. The calibrated vector\nnetwork analyzer Agilent E5071C PNA-L Network Analyzer was used\nto test the frequency responses of them.\n4.1. Matching Network\nFigure 8 shows the calculated results of the proposed dual-band\ncoupled-line impedance transformer’s reﬂection coeﬃcient magnitudes\nat Port 2 when Port 1 terminated with a ﬁctitious load which\nhas diﬀerent impedance at the two frequency bands. As shown\nin Figure 8, the proposed impedance transformer can accurately\nmatch two diﬀerent complex impedances at two designed frequency\nsimultaneously and has 20% and 15% bandwidth for which the\nreﬂection coeﬃcient magnitudes are less than 0.1, respectively.\nFigure 9(a) shows the simulated and measured results of the\nfabricated matching networks which is shown in Figure 5 at the\nﬁrst frequency 1800 MHz. To demonstrate the performance of the\nfabricated matching network, thes-parameters data plotted in Figure 9\nhave been equivalent to terminate the Port 1 with (12.878 −j∗5.190) Ω\nload which is the conjugate of the complex impedance as the network\ndesigned to present at the ﬁrst frequency 1800 MHz.

As shown in Figure 9(a), the\nproposed impedance transformer can accurately match the complex\nimpedance at the designed frequency and has 20% bandwidth for which\nthe reﬂection coeﬃcient magnitudes are less than 0.1. Because the\ntransformer is not designed to transform the load to (12.878+j∗5.190) Ω\nat 2140 MHz, the reﬂection coeﬃcient magnitude is not small at\n2140 MHz. In the same way, Figure 9(b) shows the simulated and\nmeasured results of the fabricated matching networks which is shown\nin Figure 5 at the second frequency 2140 MHz. One can also ﬁnd the\ndeviation between the measured and simulated results is small and\nthat approved the validity of the proposed matching technique. This\nmatching circuit is then used in designing a class-AB Power Ampliﬁer.\n4.2. Dual-band Class-AB Power Ampliﬁer Design\nThe bias point of the power ampliﬁer isVDS = 28 V andIDS = 150 mA\nat a Class-AB operation. Figure 10 shows the simulated and measured\n208 Li et al.\nfrequency responses of the fabricated dual-band PA based on small\nsignal S-parameters. As shown in Figure 10, the dual-band PA\nachieves a power gain exceeding 13.5 dB and 12.5 dB in the 1800 MHz\nand 2140 MHz operation bands, respectively. The PA has a 1-dB\ntransmission bandwidth of 420 MHz and 70 MHz in the 1800 MHz and\n2140 MHz operation bands, respectively. These bandwidths of the PA\ncan satisfy the requirement of base stations in the GSM 1800 and\nWCDMA concurrent communication systems. Finally, they indicated\nthat the matching conditions of the input and output terminals are\ngood for both of the desired bands.\nThe comparative perspective of the present work in light with the\nexisting state of the art is presented in Table 5.\n5. CONCLUSION\nA miniaturized and novel dual-band impedance transformer based on\nsingle coupled-line section has been proposed. The rigorous analysis of\nthe corresponding closed-form design equations are given in this paper.\nFurthermore, fabricated transformer examples with good simulated\nand measured results verify the proposed structure and its design\nmethod. Finally, a novel miniaturized dual-band power ampliﬁer by\nusing this new dual-band impedance matching technique is designed,\nfabricated and demonstrated. As a result, this proposed dual-band\nmatching technique with an analytical design approach provides a\nminiaturized matching method with inherent DC-block function for\nthe design of dual-band components and systems.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis work was supported in part by the National Natural Science\nFoundation of China (No. 61001060, No. 61201025, and No. 61201027),\nthe Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities\n(No. 2012RC0301), and Important National Science & Technology\nSpeciﬁc Projects (No. 2010ZX03007-003-04).\nREFERENCES\n1.
