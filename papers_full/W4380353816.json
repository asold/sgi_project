  "abstract": "Background and Context: Over the past year, large language models (LLMs) have\\ntaken the world by storm. In computing education, like in other walks of life,\\nmany opportunities and threats have emerged as a consequence.\\n Objectives: In this article, we explore such opportunities and threats in a\\nspecific area: responding to student programmers' help requests. More\\nspecifically, we assess how good LLMs are at identifying issues in problematic\\ncode that students request help on.\\n Method: We collected a sample of help requests and code from an online\\nprogramming course. We then prompted two different LLMs (OpenAI Codex and\\nGPT-3.5) to identify and explain the issues in the students' code and assessed\\nthe LLM-generated answers both quantitatively and qualitatively.\\n Findings: GPT-3.5 outperforms Codex in most respects. Both LLMs frequently\\nfind at least one actual issue in each student program (GPT-3.5 in 90% of the\\ncases). Neither LLM excels at finding all the issues (GPT-3.5 finding them 57%\\nof the time). False positives are common (40% chance for GPT-3.5). The advice\\nthat the LLMs provide on the issues is often sensible. The LLMs perform better\\non issues involving program logic rather than on output formatting. Model\\nsolutions are frequently provided even when the LLM is prompted not to. LLM\\nresponses to prompts in a non-English language are only slightly worse than\\nresponses to English prompts.\\n Implications: Our results continue to highlight the utility of LLMs in\\nprogramming education. At the same time, the results highlight the\\nunreliability of LLMs: LLMs make some of the same mistakes that students do,\\nperhaps especially when formatting output as required by automated assessment\\nsystems. Our study informs teachers interested in using LLMs as well as future\\nefforts to customize LLMs for the needs of programming education.\\n",
