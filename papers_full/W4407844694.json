  "abstract": "This editorial presents an optimistic yet cautious perspective on the development, deployment, and regulation of large language models (LLMs) in the field of medicine. It is essential to strike a balance between embracing the benefits of artificial intelligence-driven solutions and preserving the human touch that is vital for providing compassionate care. The exponential growth of medical data has paved the way for the integration of LLMs into healthcare, offering unprecedented opportunities to enhance clinical decision-making and alleviate physicians' workloads. Recently, LLMs have exhibited remarkable potential across various clinical scenarios, including streamlining diagnostic processes, optimizing radiology reports, and providing personalized treatment recommendations. However, the implementation of LLMs in healthcare is not without its challenges. Issues such as the scarcity of high-quality annotated data, privacy concerns, and the risk of generating misleading or overconfident information are significant hurdles that must be addressed. Moreover, while LLMs can replace certain basic tasks traditionally performed by humans, it is crucial to recognize that senior clinicians play an irreplaceable role in complex decision-making and providing emotional support to patients. By harnessing the power of LLMs to augment human capabilities while maintaining essential human elements within healthcare, we might shape a future where artificial intelligence and human intelligence coexist harmoniously. Prioritizing ethical development and deployment for artificial intelligence, empowering healthcare professionals, and safeguarding patient privacy will be key to realizing the full potential of LLMs in revolutionizing healthcare delivery. Through ongoing research, collaboration, and adaptation, responsible integration of LLMs holds promise for elevating both quality and accessibility globally, ultimately creating a more efficient, personalized, and patient-centric healthcare system.",
