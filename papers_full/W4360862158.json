  "abstract": "The article presents in detail the construction of a low-cost, portable online PD monitoring system based on the acoustic emission (AE) technique. A highly sensitive piezoelectric transducer was used as the PD detector, whose frequency response characteristics were optimized to the frequency of AE waves generated by discharges in oil–paper insulation. The popular and inexpensive Teensy 3.2 development board featuring a 32-bit MK20DX256 microcontroller with the ARM Cortex-M4 core was used to count the AE pulses. The advantage of the system is its small dimensions and weight, easy and quick installation on the transformer tank, storage of measurement data on a memory card, battery power supply, and immediate readiness for operation without the need to configure. This system may contribute to promoting the idea of short-term (several days or weeks) PD monitoring, especially in developing countries where, with the dynamically growing demand for electricity, the need for inexpensive transformer diagnostics systems is also increasing. Another area of application is medium-power transformers (up to 100 MVA), where temporary PD monitoring using complex measurement systems requiring additional infrastructure (e.g., control cabinet, cable ducts for power supply, and data transmission) and qualified staff is economically unjustified.",
