  "abstract": "This research focuses on problem identification due to faults in power transformers during operation by using dissolved gas analysis such as key gas, IEC ratio, Duval triangle techniques, and fuzzy logic approaches. Then, the condition of the power transformer is evaluated in terms of the percentage of failure index and internal fault determination. Fuzzy logic with the key gas approach was used to calculate the failure index and identify problems inside the power transformer. At the same time, the IEC three-gas ratio and Duval triangle are subsequently applied to confirm the problems in different failure types covering all possibilities inside the power transformer. After that, the fuzzy logic system was applied and validated with DGA results of 244 transformers as reference cases with satisfactory accuracy. Two transformers were evaluated and practically confirmed by the investigation results of an un-tanked power transformer. Finally, the DGA results of a total of 224 transformers were further evaluated by the fuzzy logic system. This fuzzy logic is a smart, accurate tool for automatically identifying faults occurring within transformers. Finally, the recommendation of maintenance strategy and time interval is proposed for effective planning to minimize the catastrophic damage, which could occur with the power transformer and its network.",
