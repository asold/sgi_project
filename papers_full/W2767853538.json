  "abstract": "The paper presents the results of developing a method for assessing the quality of a coated abrasive (CA) with the use of the suggested technological parameter of emery cloth elasticity figure. The authors have created an analytical model of emery cloth elasticity figure which reflects its ability to operate in the conditions of tension and bending under the relevant load. The method for determining elasticity consists in measuring the strength and resilience of the emery cloth by calculating the forces which cause the extension and deflection of the cloth. The values of the developed figure have been set experimentally by running tests on coated abrasive made from emery cloth with various characteristics: fabric-based with natural and synthetic bonds and manufacturing range grains. The authors have developed recommendations for both CA producing companies and CA using companies. They include grading the tools on the base of their actual use operations and reasonable assignment of the instrument characteristics and operation modes with the purpose of using coated abrasive rationally for maximum efficiency of workpiece processing operations.",
