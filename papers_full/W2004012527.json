Each aims at capitalizing on the FOXP2 discovery to build a neurobiological bridge between\nmolecule and phenotype. Below, we describe genetic through behavioral techniques used currently to investigate FoxP2 in birds, rodents,\nand humans for discovery of the neural bases of vocal learning and language.\nKey words:basal ganglia; birdsong; brain development; chromatin immunoprecipitation; Forkhead; FOXP2; language; motor learning;\nsong; speech; zebra finch\nLanguage is unique to humans, so how can neuroscientists study\nits molecular basis? The discovery that mutations in the human\ngene encoding forkhead box P2 (FOXP2), a transcription factor,\nresult in speech and language deficits (Lai et al., 2001; MacDer-\nmot et al., 2005) provides a molecular toehold into exploration of\nthe neural mechanisms for language. However, whose nervous\nsystem should be traversed? Humans must be explored, especially\nfor understanding how human brains uniquely recombine a fi-\nnite set of sounds to generate infinite meaning (Hauser et al.,\n2002). Another component of language, vocal learning, is also\nrare but not unique to humans. Vocal learners are animals with a\ntalent for modifying innate vocalizations to imitate or create new\nsounds. Human speech and birdsong are the best characterized\nexemplars of vocal learning, and the experimentally tractable\nsongbird has provided molecular and physiological insights. In\ncontrast, transgenically tractable rodents are not thought to learn\ntheir vocalizations; however, the recent discovery that male mice\nproduce ultrasonic sounds that are song like (Holy and Guo,\n2005) reopens the question of whether such songs are learned.\nGiven the complexity of language and the variety of speech\nand language disorders (which affect up to 1 in 20 children), no\nsingle tissue or animal model is likely adequate for discovery of\nthe neural bases. Fortunately, a model system need not capture\nevery aspect of a behavior or disorder to be useful. Below, scien-\ntists, whose interests range from basic brain– behavior relation-\nships to human cognitive specializations, apply their expertise\nand model systems to gain understanding of the neural basis of\nvocal learning and language. Given the firm association between\nFOXP2 mutations and language deficits, these scientists aim to\nidentify the gene targets of this transcriptional regulator and to\ninvestigate the evolutionary, developmental, and real-time roles\nof FoxP2 in bona fide vocal learners, with a prospective of devel-\noping additional models.\nInvestigating FOXP2 mutations: humans, cell lines, and\nmutant mice (S. E. Fisher)\nGenetic mapping in an unusual multigenerational family exhib-\niting a monogenic communication disorder (Fisher et al., 1998)\nprovided the first link betweenFOXP2 and language (Lai et al.,\n2001). Affected members of the “KE” family carry a heterozygous\npoint mutation, yielding an amino acid substitution (R553H) in\nthe DNA-binding domain of the FOXP2 protein. This tiny\nchange correlates with a multifaceted phenotype (Marcus and\nFisher, 2003; Vargha-Khadem et al., 2005) that includes pro-\nfound deficits in learning and production of complex sequences\nof mouth movements, impairing speech (verbal dyspraxia), as\nwell as wide-ranging problems with language, extending beyond\nexpressive domains (Watkins et al., 2002a). Despite knowing the\nprimary cause of this disorder, we have little understanding of\nhow FOXP2 exerts its influence(s) on the brain. The Fisher labo-\nratory and collaborators are using three complementary strate-\ngies to bridge this gene– brain gap.\nAdditional studies in humans\nTo date, insights into theFOXP2-associated disorder come pre-\ndominantly from behavioral and neuroimaging studies of a single\nmutation, R553H, on one background, that of the KE family.\nThese early efforts identified anomalies in subcortical structures\n(including caudate and cerebellum) (Watkins et al., 2002b) and\nReceived Aug. 4, 2006; revised Aug. 17, 2006; accepted Aug. 21, 2006.\nThis work was supported by National Institutes of Health (NIH) Grant MH070712 (S.A.W.), The Royal Society,\nWellcome Trust, and United Kingdom Medical Research Council (S.E.F.), NIH Grant MH075028 (D.H.G.), The German\nScience Foundation Sonderforschungsbereich 515, 665 (C.S.), and NIH Grant DC005964 and the Pew Scholars Pro-\ngram (T.E.H.).\nCorrespondence should be addressed to Stephanie A.

To more fully reveal complex geno-\ntype–phenotype relationships, we screened the entire coding re-\ngion ofFOXP2 in 49 probands diagnosed with verbal dyspraxia.\nWe found a novel nonsense mutation (R328X) that truncates the\nprotein and segregates with disorder in relatives of the proband\n(MacDermot et al., 2005). Detailed phenotypic studies of the\nfamily are underway. We and others are also studying cases of\nchromosomal rearrangement involving theFOXP2 locus. These\ninclude translocations (Lai et al., 2001; Shriberg et al., 2006) as\nwell as deletions that involve multiple genes (Liegeois et al., 2001;\nZeesman et al., 2006).\nCell lines\nGiven the ethical and practical limitations to human studies,\nanalyses of FOXP2 function using human neuron-like cells\ngrown in the laboratory, although potentially “reductionist,” can\nbe highly informative. Such systems enabled us to assess distur-\nbances in subcellular localization, DNA binding, and transactiva-\ntion properties associated with the R553H and R328X mutations\n(Vernes et al., 2006). Moreover,in vitromodels can be used to\nidentify other elements in FOXP2-related pathways. For exam-\nple, the Fisher laboratory and that of D. H. Geschwind have each\nused chromatin immunoprecipitation to isolate fragments of\nDNA that are directly bound by FOXP2 protein in living neurons,\nallowing us to successfully isolate downstream targets (see below,\nsection by D. H. Geschwind).\nMouse models\nOrthologs of FOXP2 are highly conserved across distant verte-\nbrates in both coding sequence and CNS expression (Lai et al.,\n2003; Haesler et al., 2004; Teramitsu et al., 2004; Bonkowsky and\nChien, 2005). Expression patterns suggest that FOXP2 in a com-\nmon vertebrate ancestor may have influenced the emergence of\ncircuits involved in sensory processing, sensorimotor integra-\ntion, and control of skilled coordinated movements (Scharff and\nHaesler, 2005; Fisher and Marcus, 2006). Mice are highly effective\nsystems for genetic manipulation, and we produced an allelic\nseries of mice that carryFoxp2 point mutations identical to those\nproducing language disorders in humans. These models are im-\nportant for studying etiological pathways at multiple levels (mo-\nlecular, cellular, morphological, developmental, electrophysio-\nlogical, and behavioral). Furthermore, although songbirds\npresently represent the model of choice for uncovering mecha-\nnisms involved in vocal learning (see below, sections by S. A.\nWhite and C. Scharff), mice still offer perspectives about the roles\nof genes in vocalizations. For example, a recent study by another\ngroup (Shu et al., 2005) reported that ablation ofFoxp2 in their\ntargeted knock-out correlated with a reduction in the number of\nisolation calls made by mouse pups when removed from their\nmother, although no abnormalities in call structure were noted.\nAccordingly, we are in the midst of performing detailed analyses\nof the vocalizations in ourFoxp2 mutant lines. Intriguingly, Holy\nand Guo (2005) have discovered that vocalizations of adult male\nmice are more complex than previously appreciated and share\ncharacteristics of birdsong (see below, section by T. E. Holy).\nWhether or not such vocalizations are learned, it will be interest-\ning to determine whether/howFoxp2 mutations affect the prop-\nerties of these “mouse songs.”\nInvestigating FOXP2 function in cognition: genomic\nscreening for FOXP2 targets in humans (D. H. Geschwind)\nEvidence from many sources demonstrates a strong but complex\ngenetic component for language that consists of many loci and\ninteracts with environmental factors (Fisher et al., 2003). Al-\nthough rare, monogenic disorders of speech and language, such\nas those caused by FOXP2 mutation, provide a unique window\nthrough which to study the biological basis of speech and lan-\nguage in health and disease. Thus, one of the goals of the\nGeschwind laboratory is to identify downstream targets of\nFOXP2 that may be relevant to human brain development, so as\nto learn more about the molecular events driving this complex\nprocess. Development of regional identity in the mammalian tel-\nencephalon occurs over a protracted period and is modifiable\nuntil the middle to late stages of neurogenesis and migration (in\nhumans, 10 –25 weeks gestation) (Barbe and Levitt, 1995; McCo-\nnnell, 1995; Rakic, 1995; Fishell, 1997; Nothias et al., 1998; Rakic\nand Lombroso, 1998; Rubenstein and Beachy, 1998). This is thus\na critical time to identify and study gene products involved in the\ndevelopment of human higher functions such as speech and lan-\nguage (Geschwind and Miller, 2001; Geschwind et al., 2002; Sun\net al., 2005), including the effects of FOXP2 on the basal ganglia\nand cortex.\nThe Geschwind laboratory has developed a staged genomic\nscreening approach using chromatin immunoprecipitation cou-\npled to microarray analysis (ChIP–Chip) to identify potential\nneural targets of human FOXP2, bothin vitroand in vivo. ChIP–\nChip enables the genome-wide study of direct interactions be-\ntween a protein and the chromosomal sites to which it binds, in\nthe context of the normal chromatin structure of living tissue\n(Ren et al., 2000; Ren and Dynlacht, 2004). Briefly, cells or tissues\nare treated with a crosslinking agent, and then an antibody rec-\nognizing the protein of interest is used to selectively immunopre-\ncipitate protein–DNA complexes. After reversing crosslinks, the\nrecovered DNA is hybridized to arrays containing DNA from\nthousands of human genes, allowing systematic identification of\ntranscription factor binding sites. For these experiments, we\nmade high-affinity, specific polyclonal antibodies based on\nunique C-terminal regions of FOXP2.In vitro, ChIP exploited\nSH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells, after induction of FOXP2\nexpression via BDNF/retinoic acid treatment, whereasin vivo,\nChIP involved material from human basal ganglia and inferior\nfrontal cortex at midgestation. In each case, experiments were\nperformed in triplicate, and the DNA that was pulled down was\nhybridized to microarrays containing/H11011700 bp of the promoter\nregions and 300 bp from the intronic regions of/H110116000 human\ngenes (Aviva Systems Biology Corporation, San Diego, CA). Tar-\nget sequences are found in genes from a variety of gene ontology\ncategories, including those involved in neural development.\nChIP–Chip can identify regions of transcription factor bind-\ning at high specificity (Ren et al., 2000; Ren and Dynlacht, 2004;\nKim et al., 2005). However, it does not determine whether bind-\ning has a functional effect on the putative target gene or whether\nbinding results in transcriptional repression or activation. In the\nlast stage of this genomic screening experiment, we used small\ninterfering RNA and overexpression in vitro to demonstrate\nfunctional effects of FOXP2 binding on target genes suggested by\nChIP–Chip. The function and expression of these genes vis-a`-vis\nthe development of circuits involved in speech and language and\ndisorders disrupting them (e.g., autism; specific language impair-\nment) are now important avenues of our research.\nDynamic regulation ofFoxP2 during singing (S. A. White)\nThe corticostriatal abnormalities that accompany verbal dys-\npraxia in humans bearingFOXP2 mutations implicate FOXP2 in\nthe ontogenesis of neural circuitry involved in speech and lan-\nguage. Accordingly, the powerful strategies outlined above use\nWhite et al.• Models for FOXP2 in Human Speech J. Neurosci., October 11, 2006 • 26(41):10376 –10379 • 10377\nFOXP2 as a molecular entry point toward understanding how the\nbrain develops this capacity. The White laboratory and that of C.\nScharff (see below, section by C. Scharff) have used songbirds as\nbehaviorally relevant and physiologically accessible models to de-\ntermine whether FOXP2 additionally functions during vocal\nlearning and in adulthood (Scharff and White, 2004). To address\nthe question of a real-time role during vocalization, the White\nlaboratory has examined FoxP2 mRNA expression in zebra\nfinches, a songbird species in which males sing stable, unchang-\ning songs to court females. Any alteration inFoxP2 within the\nsong control regions of adult singers would thus reflect real-time\nchanges rather than the developmental or seasonal ones, dis-\ncussed below.\nMale zebra finches offer another potential insight to a behav-\nioral role of FoxP2 because they display two basic types of singing:\n“directed” singing is when a male performs to a female; “undi-\nrected” singing is when a male practices alone or sings in the\npresence of, but not toward, conspecifics (Zann, 1996). These\nacoustically similar yet socially distinct vocal behaviors allowed\nus to address whether any mature function of FoxP2 is purely\nmotor or also contingent on social context (Jarvis et al., 1998).\nWe found thatFoxP2 mRNA declines rapidly and specifically\nwithin the striatal song control region Area X when males sing\nbut is stable in nonsinging birds. Furthermore, this decline occurs\nwhen males practice alone but not when they perform to females\n(Teramitsu and White, 2006). This real-time regulation ofFoxP2\nduring vocalization, dependent on social context, suggests that\nFoxP2 functions beyond development and beyond pure motor\ncontrol. Obtained from a humble grass finch, these data nonethe-\nless support the conclusion that humanFOXP2 mutations entail\nmore than motor deficits (Watkins et al., 2002a) and suggest, by\nanalogy, postdevelopmental roles for FOXP2 in human speech.\nFoxP2 in brain evolution, development, and vocal learning:\nmore perspectives from the birds (C. Scharff)\nFOXP2 has undergone recent positive selection in human history\n(Enard et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2002). Given the established\nfinding thatFOXP2 mutations lead to speech and language dis-\norders, it is tempting to speculate that the adaptive evolution of\nhuman FOXP2 may have related to the emergence of modern\nspeech capacities (Enard et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2002). Among\nbirds, however, there is no evidence that Darwinian selection of\nchanges in the FoxP2 protein sequence contributed to vocal\nlearning in some, but not other, avian species (Webb and Zhang,\n2005). Given this evolutionary difference, can findings from\nsongbirds really be relevant to the role of FOXP2 in human\nspeech? Perhaps. To begin, despite some differences, the FoxP2\nprotein of songbirds is astonishingly similar to mammalian\nFoxP2: for example, the zebra finch and human sequences share\n100% identity within the DNA-binding domain (Haesler et al.,\n2004; Teramitsu et al., 2004). A strong conservation like this often\nindicates shared function. Furthermore, the FoxP2 expression\npattern in the brain of many birds that learn their songs by imi-\ntation is very similar to that of rodents and humans, including\nexpression within the same cell types, such as striatal medium\nspiny neurons (Scharff and Haesler, 2005). FoxP2 is expressed\nearly in the embryo and remains “on” in some regions into adult-\nhood. What does this have to do with speech? It suggests that\nFoxP2 is necessary to allow brain regions involved in vocal be-\nhavior to develop properly during embryonic life (see above, sec-\ntions by S. E. Fisher and D. H. Geschwind). If so, does it fulfill a\nrelated, or a different, role later in life, after the brain has finished\nits “construction phase”?\nTo address the latter question, the Scharff laboratory exam-\nined FoxP2 mRNA expression in young male zebra finches. We\nfound that, when the birds are in full swing of learning to sing,\nthere is moreFoxP2, bilaterally in Area X (Haesler et al., 2004),\nthe striatal region known to be vital for song learning (Sohrabji et\nal., 1990; Scharff and Nottebohm, 1991). This finding suggests\nthat FoxP2 might be directly involved in the learning, but perhaps\nthis is just coincidence. However, adult canaries also have higher\nFoxP2 expression in Area X exactly during those months of the\nyear when they remodel their song after having previously sung\nvery stable song to woo females (Haesler et al., 2004). Coinci-\ndence again? To find out whether FoxP2 is required for song\nbehavior, we need to get rid of it, at the right time, in the right\nplace. Because knock-out technology is not yet available for song-\nbirds, we use RNA interference to downregulateFoxP2 in Area X.\nThese studies, still ongoing, should soon provide answers to the\nfollowing questions. Can zebra finches still sing normal song after\ngrowing up with less FoxP2 in Area X than normally present?\nEven more interestingly, will they still copy the song of an adult\nmale tutor? By selecting an animal model (here, a songbird) that\nexhibits key aspects of the behaviors affected in humans with\nFOXP2 mutations (here, vocal learning), the potential for observ-\ning the effects of functional intervention can be realized.\nAnalyzing the ultrasonic songs of male mice (T. E. Holy)\nAlthough the most widely appreciated vocalizations of mice are\naudible, it has been known for several decades that mice and\nother rodents also vocalize at ultrasonic frequencies. In the Holy\nlaboratory, we recorded and analyzed the vocalizations of a siz-\nable population of adult males. When the recordings were com-\nputationally shifted into the range of human hearing, these vo-\ncalizations were found to be subjectively reminiscent of bird\nsongs.\nTo objectively determine the extent of similarity with bird\nsongs, individual syllables were analyzed quantitatively (Holy\nand Guo, 2005). Mouse syllables can be classified into distinct\ntypes, with several different approaches yielding consistent clas-\nsifications. These vocalizations are also structured in time. Dur-\ning a bout of vocalization, syllable types are arranged in nonran-\ndom order, with the most obvious characteristic being that\nparticular types tend to be repeated several times before a new\nsyllable type is uttered. Finally, individual mice show reproduc-\nible biases in terms of their syllable type usage and degree of\nrepetitiveness, traits that reliably distinguish them from other\nmales. Consequently, these vocalizations have many of the char-\nacteristics that have been described for birdsong.\nRecently, we further examined the stimulus triggers for these\nsongs. Previous work has shown that males vocalize in the pres-\nence of females and also when they encounter mouse phero-\nmones, chemosensory cues detected by the olfactory system. We\nexamined whether the songs uttered in the presence of male cues\nare different from those triggered by female cues. We find that the\nsongs differ greatly in terms of degree (with far more singing\ntriggered by female than by male cues) but do not find any con-\nsistent difference in the character of the songs. Together, these\ndiscoveries increase the attractiveness of mice as model systems\nfor study of vocalizations (see above, section by S. E. Fisher).\nConclusion\nThe first report ofFOXP2 as a monogenetic locus of a speech and\nlanguage disorder has enabled great strides in the design and\nexecution of experiments that bring us closer to understanding\nthe biological basis of vocal learning and language.
