    "abstract": "This paper conducts a correlation review of classification algorithm using some free available data mining and knowledge discovery tools such as WEKA, Rapid miner, Tanagra, Orange and Knime. The accuracy of classification algorithm like Decision tree, Decision Stump, K-Nearest Neighbor and Naïve Bayes algorithm have been compared using all five tools. Indian Liver Patient DataSet is used for testing the Classification algorithm in order to classify the people with and without Liver disorder.",
