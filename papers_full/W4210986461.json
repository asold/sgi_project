Introduction     \n \nImpedance matching is an important aspect in the des ign of microwave and millimeter \nwave circuitry since impedance mismatches may severely d eteriorate the overall \nperformance of electronic systems. \nIn high-power applications, the standing electromagnetic wave res ulting from mismatch in \na transmission line is highly undesirable as it leads to amplitudes of voltage and current \nwhich might be several times higher than those in a  matched line. This can lead to \ndisruption or even damage of the dielectric in the transmission line . A reflected \nelectromagnetic wave can also result in frequency p ulling of signal generators connected to \nthe mismatched transmission line, thereby shifting the oscillation frequency fro m the \ndesired. \nIn transceiver applications, antenna mismatch leads to signal power loss and lower signal-\nto-noise ratio, thereby deteriorating the overall transmit or receive performance. \nWhen designing low-noise amplifiers, it is often required to  control the input network \nmismatch. Generally, it is not possible to design a n amplifier which has the optimum input \nimpedance for minimum noise figure equal in value to  the optimum impedance for \nmaximum gain. The input network is then should be m ismatched in order to provide a low-\nnoise operation. \nImpedance transformers can also be effectively used  to improve selectivity of resonant \ncircuits and are very useful in filter design. Low values of source and load impedance \ndecrease the loaded quality factor Q and increase the bandwidth of a given resonant circuit. \nThis makes it very difficult to design even a basic LC high-Q resonant circuit for use \nbetween two very low values of source and load resi stances. A common method to \novercome this problem is to use impedance transforming circ uits to present the resonant \ncircuit with a source or load resistance that is mu ch larger than what is actually present. \nConsequently, by utilizing impedance transformers, both the Q of the resonator and its \nselectivity can be increased. \nMatching a complex impedance in a wide frequency ra nge is most commonly achieved by \nusing one of the following techniques: \n- passive two-port networks consisting of reactive components; \n- passive two-port networks consisting of resistive components; \n14\nwww.intechopen.com\nPassive Microwave Components and Antennas304\n \nWideband matching can also be achieved by means of ferrite circu lators in which the \nreflected wave is guided to an absorbing load, and ferrite isolators in which the transmission \nlosses are different for the incident and reflected waves. \nFor a wideband matching, it is preferable to place the matching network as close as po ssible \nto the load, as it is illustrated in Fig. 1. \n \nFig. 1. Voltage standing wave patterns. Placing of the matching network with regard to the \ngenerator for wideband (a), and narrowband (b) matching. \n \nThis concept will be demonstrated in the later sect ion 3.1 by considering an example of \nmatching a complex load using shunt stubs. \nIn this chapter, different techniques for wideband matching are presented. Sections 2 thru 4 \nbriefly present some of the well-known matching techniques while the use of coupled \ntransmission lines for wideband matching is treated in depth in Section 5. The first part of \nthe chapter includes a discussion of resistive and reac tive lumped elements in Section 2, \ndifferent types of stub matching in Section 3, and t he use of series of transmission lines in \nSection 4. Since these techniques are all thoroughl y treated in the literature, only the design-\nconsiderations relevant for applying the techniques for wideband matching are treated here \nwhile the reader is referred to the literature for specifics, such as the relevant form ulas for \ncalculating the values of the different components.  \nThe use of coupled transmission lines for wideband impedance matching is not as widely \nused as the techniques described in sections 2 thru 4. Hence, in Section 5, a detailed \npresentation of this technique is given. \n \nZL \nMatching \nnetwork\nZL \nMatching \nnetwork\n… \n… \n… \n… \nLoad \nLoad \nGenerator \nGenerator \nZ0\nZ0\nZ0\nZ0\n|V| |V|\n|V| |V|\n(a) \n(b)\n \n2.

For moderate bandwidths, the component \nvalues of two-element matching networks can be found relatively easy by f irst choosing a \npair of initial values on the basis of the Smith Ch art and then applying computational \noptimization. To increase the bandwidth, more than two reactive elements are required. The \nsynthesis and optimization of multi-element wideband matc hing circuits can be \naccomplished by means of software tools, which are currently available in a wide variety. \nThe implementation of this type of transformers in microwave and millimeter wave range is \nlimited due to the low Q-factor of lumped components . Therefore, lumped element \nmatching is usually employed only at low frequencies,  or in applications where compact \nsize is a major requirement, e.g., in monolithic mi crowave integrated circuits design \n(Kinayman & Aksun, 2005). \n \n3. Stub matching \n \nThis section is dedicated to matching circuits that us e open-circuited or short-circuited \ntransmission line sections, connected in parallel with the load or transmission feed line. This \nis a well developed matching technique which is ofte n used in microwave and millimeter \nwave circuits.  In this section, some of the important operational principles and properties of \nshunt stub matching circuits are discussed. More det ailed analysis of this type of matching \ntechnique is available in the literature (Pozar, 1998), (Kinayman & Aksun, 2005). \n \n3.1 Single-Stub Matching \nThis is one of the most simple and convenient ways o f matching a transmission line with a \nload which has real or complex impedance. This meth od was developed by Tatarinov V. V. \nin 1931 and is widely used for narrow-band matching in microwave and millimeter wave \napplications. It consists of  a short circuited or open circuited stub and a piece of \ntransmission line between the load and the stub. An example of the sing le-stub matching \ncircuit is shown in Fig. 2.   \nThere are several choices of electric distance θd from the load to the matching stub. In the \nfirst case (Fig. 2 (a)), the distance between the l oad and matching stub is chosen as short as \npossible while this distance is chosen to be several  times longer in the second case \n(Fig. 2 (b)). The responses of these two matching circuits are shown in Fig. 3. The 10 dB  \nreflection loss bandwidth of the circuit in Fig. 2 (a) is 10.3 % while the same parameter for \nthe circuit in Fig. 2 (b) is equal to 1.9 %. Thus, by using θd = 56.85° instead of θd = 282.05°, the \nbandwidth is increased by more than a factor of 5. \nThere is also a difference in the wideband response of the matching circuits. The circuit with \nlong distance between the load and the matching stub demonstrates more passbands in the \nsame frequency range. \n \nwww.intechopen.com\nImpedance Transformers 305\n \nWideband matching can also be achieved by means of ferrite circu lators in which the \nreflected wave is guided to an absorbing load, and ferrite isolators in which the transmission \nlosses are different for the incident and reflected waves. \nFor a wideband matching, it is preferable to place the matching network as close as po ssible \nto the load, as it is illustrated in Fig. 1. \n \nFig. 1.

In practice, stub spacings are usually cho sen as odd number of λg/8, for \nexample λg/8, 3λg/8 or 5λg/8. \n \n3.3 Triple-Stub Matching \nThe double-stub matching circuit can not match all load impedanc es. For a specified \ndistance between two stubs, the matching is possible  only for limited values of loads, which \ndepend on amplitude and phase of the standing wave. This limitation ari ses from the fact, \nthat the stub itself can not change the real part of the impedance at the point of connection to \nthe transmission line. \n This limitation can be overcomed by using a triple-stub matching as the one shown in \nFig. 5.  \n \nFig. 5.

Series Transmission Line Matching \n \nThis section is dedicated to matching circuits that  use series transmission lines, such as \nsingle section quarter-wave transformer, multisection transformers, and tapered \ntransmission lines. \n \n4.1 The Quarter-Wave Transformer \nThe quarter-wave transformer is one of the most simple and practical circu its for impedance \nmatching, especially for matching of real load impedances. It is also poss ible to match a \ncomplex load using the quarter-wave transformer, but  this requires an additional length of \ntransmission line between the load and the quarter-wave transformer to transform the \ncomplex load impedance into a real impedance. A cir cuit employing a quarter-wave \ntransformer is shown in Fig. 6. \n \nFig. 6. A single section quarter-wave matching transformer. \n \nOne of the main drawbacks of this transformer is the requirement to have available a \ntransmission line with an impedance of \n2 0 1 01 ZZZ  . In some cases, e.g., matching with \ncoaxial cable, the required quarter wave transmissi on line calls for a nonstandard value of \nthe characteristic impedance.  \n \n4.2. Transformers with Fixed Values of Characteristic Impedance \nAnother useful type of series transformers are those which are based on tr ansmission lines \nwith the same characteristic impedances as the lines which should be mat ched. Such \ntransformers are convenient for interconnection of standard lines as well as transmission \nlines with different geometry, where realization of transmission lines of arbitrary \ncharacteristic impedance involve difficulties. \nThe simplest realization of such transformer is shown in Fig. 7 (a) and  described in detail by \n(Aizenberg et al., 1985).  \nZ01 \nλg/4 \n2 0 1 01 ZZZ  Z02 \n \n \nFig. 7.

For increasing n, the value of l approaches 0. \nThe operating frequency band of the described trans former is about 5 % narrower in \ncomparison to the quarter-wave transformer, and its length for practical values of n is 1.5 - 2 \ntimes shorter. \nThe response of the transformer in Fig. 7 (a) is shown in Fig. 8 (curve (a)) and compared to \nthe response of the conventional quarter-wave transformer (Fig. 8 curve (b)). For \ntransformation ratio 2:1 the electrical length of the section in Fig. 7 (a) is equal to 28.1°.

Comparison of matching characteristic of quarter-wave transformer (Fig. 6) and \ntransformers with fixed values of characteristic impedance (Fig. 7). The transformation ratio \nis 2:1. Here, f0 is the center frequency of operation. \n \nA more broadband stepped impedance transformer is s hown in Fig. 7 (b)). It consists of four \nsections with the length of the outermost sections being shorter than the length of sections in \nthe middle. Fig. 8 (curve (c)) shows the magnitude of S 11 for a transformer with the \nfallowing parameters: the transformation ratio is 2:1; θ1/θ2= l1/l2 = 0.35. \nHere  \n \nθ1 = 2π l1/ λg ,   and    θ1 = 2π l1/ λg     (2) \n \nare the electrical lengths of the sections in  Fig. 7 (b). \nThe total length of the transformer is 2 l1 + 2l2 = 0.346λg. The achieved bandwidth at 20 dB  \nreturn loss level is 71 %. The bandwidth and inband  reflection level of this type of \ntransformer depend on length of the sections (Aizenberg et al., 1985).  \n \n4.3 Tapered Transmission Lines \nAs described above, the bandwidth of the quarter-wave transformer is limited. In order t o \nextend its operating frequency band, multisection t ransformers, with different characteristic \nimpedance in each section, may be used. In contrast to the transformers described in the \nprevious section, the lengths of the sections used in the multisection transformer can be \nchosen equal to each other. The desired reflection coefficient response as a function of \nfrequency can be achieved by properly choosing the characteristic impedance of the \ntransmission line sections. In the limit of an infi nite number of sections, the multisection \ntransformer becomes a continuously tapered line.  There are many ways to choose the ta per \nprofile. By changing the type of taper, one can obtain different pass band characteristics.  \nSeveral taper profiles may be considered: linear, exponential, triangular, and so on. \n(a) λg/6 transformer in Fig. 7 (a);\n-40 -20 0 20 40-60 60\n-40\n-30\n-20\n-10\n-50\n0\n(f-fo)/fo (%)\nMagnitude of S11 (dB)\n(a)\n(b)\n(c) \n(b) quarter-wave transformer;\n(c)transformer in Fig. 7(b).\n \nFor a given taper length, the Klopfenstein taper has been shown to be op timum in the sense \nthat the reflection coefficient is minimum over the passband (Pozar, 1998). Alternatively, for \na specified level of reflection coefficient, the Klo pfenstein taper yields the shortest matching \nsection. However, it should be noted that the response of this taper has equal level of ripples \nin its passband. \nIn many cases, the relation between the physical dimensions and the characteristic \nimpedance of a guiding structure is complicated and t he generation of an optimal tapering \nconfiguration is thus not a trivial task. This implies  that a linear or exponential tapering of \nthe physical dimensions of the transmission line is  often chosen for practical \nimplementations. \n \n5. Coupled Line Transformers \n \nIn recent years, coupled transmission lines have been s uggested as a matching element due \nto greater flexibility and compactness in comparison to  quarter wavelength transmission \nlines (Jensen et al., 2007). It has been demonstrated that matching real and complex loads \nwith coupled lines leads to more compact realizatio ns and could therefore become \nimportant at millimeter-wave frequencies for on-chip matching solutions. Another area \nwhere coupled line structures are useful is matching of antenna array structures, as \nsuccessfully demonstrated by (Jaworski & Krozer, 2004). \nAs it was shown above, the quarter-wave transformer is simple and easy t o use, but it has \nno flexibility beyond the ability to provide a perfect  match at the center frequency for a real-\nvalued load, although a complex load of course can be matched by increasing the overall \nlength of the transformer. The coupled line section pro vides a number of variables which \ncan be utilized for matching purposes. These variables are the even and odd mode \nimpedances and loads of the through and coupled por ts. This loading can be done in form \nof a feedback connection which provides additional zeros for broadband matching. \nThese variables can be chosen to provide a perfect match or any desired value of the \nreflection coefficient at the operating frequency. The bandwidth of the coupled line \ntransformer can be further increased in case of mismatch. In addition, it is also possible to \nmatch a complex load. \nIn the lower GHz range the loading of the through and coupled ports can b e done with \nlumped elements which allows for easy matching of bo th real and imaginary impedance \nvalues. At higher frequencies it is not possible to us e lumped elements, but the difference \nbetween the even and odd mode impedances is a parameter which makes it  possible to turn \na mixed real and imaginary control load at the through port into a purely imaginary one, \nwhich can be implemented with a transmission line stub. \n \n5.1 Symmetric Coupled Line Section \nCoupled line impedance transformers are very useful at millimetre wave frequencies where \nthey successfully perform direct current blocking a nd can handle large impedance \ntransformation avoiding transverse resonances which occur in a conventional low \nimpedance quarter-wave transformer.  The most common configuration of the transformer \nis shown in Fig. 9. \nwww.intechopen.com\nImpedance Transformers 311\n \n \nFig. 8. Comparison of matching characteristic of quarter-wave transformer (Fig. 6) and \ntransformers with fixed values of characteristic impedance (Fig. 7). The transformation ratio \nis 2:1. Here, f0 is the center frequency of operation. \n \nA more broadband stepped impedance transformer is s hown in Fig. 7 (b)). It consists of four \nsections with the length of the outermost sections being shorter than the length of sections in \nthe middle. Fig. 8 (curve (c)) shows the magnitude of S 11 for a transformer with the \nfallowing parameters: the transformation ratio is 2:1; θ1/θ2= l1/l2 = 0.35. \nHere  \n \nθ1 = 2π l1/ λg ,   and    θ1 = 2π l1/ λg     (2) \n \nare the electrical lengths of the sections in  Fig. 7 (b). \nThe total length of the transformer is 2 l1 + 2l2 = 0.346λg. The achieved bandwidth at 20 dB  \nreturn loss level is 71 %. The bandwidth and inband  reflection level of this type of \ntransformer depend on length of the sections (Aizenberg et al., 1985).  \n \n4.3 Tapered Transmission Lines \nAs described above, the bandwidth of the quarter-wave transformer is limited. In order t o \nextend its operating frequency band, multisection t ransformers, with different characteristic \nimpedance in each section, may be used. In contrast to the transformers described in the \nprevious section, the lengths of the sections used in the multisection transformer can be \nchosen equal to each other. The desired reflection coefficient response as a function of \nfrequency can be achieved by properly choosing the characteristic impedance of the \ntransmission line sections. In the limit of an infi nite number of sections, the multisection \ntransformer becomes a continuously tapered line.  There are many ways to choose the ta per \nprofile. By changing the type of taper, one can obtain different pass band characteristics.  \nSeveral taper profiles may be considered: linear, exponential, triangular, and so on. \n(a) λg/6 transformer in Fig. 7 (a);\n-40 -20 0 20 40-60 60\n-40\n-30\n-20\n-10\n-50\n0\n(f-fo)/fo (%)\nMagnitude of S11 (dB)\n(a)\n(b)\n(c) \n(b) quarter-wave transformer;\n(c)transformer in Fig. 7(b).\n \nFor a given taper length, the Klopfenstein taper has been shown to be op timum in the sense \nthat the reflection coefficient is minimum over the passband (Pozar, 1998).

The response (3) for the transformer of Fig. 12 is \nshown in Fig. 13. \n \nFig. 13. Response of transformer shown in Fig. 12. The transformation ratio is 1:2. \n \nAs it can be seen in Fig. 13, this transformer configuratio n exhibits an additional minimum \nin the magnitude of S 11 in comparison to the traditional impedance transformer based on  \ncoupled line section with open-circuited terminals (Kajfez, 1981). These minima are non-\nuniformly distributed in the frequency domain.

The first part of this bo ok is devoted to the advances in the analysis techn iques\nsuch as method of moments, finite-difference time- domain method, boundary perturbation theory, Fourie r\nanalysis, mode-matching method, and analysis based on circuit theory. These techniques are considered with\nregard to several challenging technological applica tions such as those related to electrically large d evices,\nscattering in layered structures, photonic crystals , and artificial materials. The second part of the book deals\nwith waveguides, transmission lines and transitions . This includes microstrip lines (MSL), slot wavegu ides,\nsubstrate integrated waveguides (SIW), vertical tra nsmission lines in multilayer media as well as MSL to SIW\nand MSL to slot line transitions.\nHow to reference\nIn order to correctly reference this scholarly work , feel free to copy and paste the following:\nVitaliy Zhurbenko, Viktor Krozer and Tonny Rubaek ( 2010).
