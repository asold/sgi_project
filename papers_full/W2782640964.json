Moreover, in philosophy of technology little attention has been paid to\nthe relation between language and philosophy (Coeckelbergh 2015, 2017). One\nexception is Winner ( 1986), who uses a cultural-hermeneutic interpretation of\nWittgenstein to emphasize how technologies are always embedded in forms of life.\nAnother exception is Nordmann ( 2002), who has used the Tractatus to link\nWittgenstein with thinking about technology. Furthermore, Hans Poser has\ndiscussed forms of life in context of technical design research, but without a\nconcrete Wittgenstein exegesis (Poser 2004). There are also some references to\nWittgenstein in the context of AI research (Birnbacher 1995; Friesen and Berr 2004:\n237–239). Bernhard Irrgang cites Thomas Rentsch’s interpretation of Wittgenstein\nand Heidegger (Rentsch 2003) as one conceptual fundamental of technical practice\n(Irrgang 2007: 89–98). Kogge ( 2015) proposes a ‘‘grammatical’’ investigation of\ntechnology, which aims at clarifying concepts used in philosophy of technology in a\nway that reveals distinctions relevant to our life-reality as they structure our actions\nand experience. For instance, Wittgenstein’s concept of ‘‘family resemblances’’ can\nbe used in this way. However, this approach is still mainly linguistic/conceptually\noriented, whereas we—in line with the empirical turn—emphasize also the\nmateriality of tools and concrete embodied techniques and add a transcendental\nargument. We agree with Peter Keicher, who claims that Wittgenstein’s works can\nbe interpreted both as a philosophical approach of technology and as technical\npraxis of philosophy itself ( 2008: 193). These are all interesting suggestions, but\nthere is much more work to be done. The exceptions conﬁrm the rule: there is very\nlittle attention to Wittgenstein in contemporary philosophy of technology, and a\nsystematic interpretation and use of Wittgenstein for philosophy of technology is\nlacking.\nAt the same time, in Wittgenstein scholarship there has been little attention to\ntechnology. While it is often acknowledged that Wittgenstein was also working as\nengineer and architect, links between these biographical elements and his work\nremain undertheorized and are discussed in a way that does not render them\ninteresting for philosophers of technology. An exception is Sterrett ( 2005), who\nlinks Wittgenstein’s thinking to aeronautical research, in particular the building of\nexperimental models. This is interesting, since a connection is made between\n166 M. Coeckelbergh, M. Funk\n123\ntechnology and Wittgenstein’s thinking. More generally, if we take a closer look at\nWittgenstein’s work we see that several conceptual traces of engineering can be\nfound: the Tractatus, but especially his later works after 1930, bear explicit\nreferences to tool use and techniques, also in relation to his method (Nordmann\n2002: 358–368; Keicher 2008: 191; Kogge: 95). One example can be found\nimmediately at the beginning of the Philosophical Investigations :\nA is building with building stones: there are blocks, pillars, slabs and beams. B\nhas to pass him the stones and to do so in the order in which A needs them. For\nthis purpose they make use of a language consisting of the words ‘‘block,’’\n‘‘pillar,’’ ‘‘slab,’’ ‘‘beam’’. A calls them out; B brings the stone which he has\nlearnt to bring at such-and-such a call.—Conceive of this as a complete\nprimitive language. (Wittgenstein 2009: § 2/6e)\nThis reference to building and technology is not an incidental hint. Wittgenstein\nuses it as a paradigmatic case for his further elaborations, for example explicitly in §\n6 (2009: §6/7e), § 19 (2009: §19/11e) or § 48 (2009: §48/27e) and in On Certainty §\n566 (Wittgenstein 1969: §566/74e). Our paper addresses these gaps and this twofold\n‘‘forgetting’’ (philosophers of technology forgetting Wittgenstein and Wittgenstein\nscholars forgetting technology) by taking signiﬁcant steps towards constructing a\nsystematic framework for a Wittgensteinian philosophy of technology.\nWhile we acknowledge that there is continuity between the Tractatus and his\nlater writings (Rentsch 2003: 340ff.), in this paper we are focusing primarily the\nlater work, especially the Investigations. We choose the Investigations because this\nwork is highly traversed by many explicit examples of technical practice, but also\nby a lot of methodological claims that are not only relevant to philosophy of\ntechnology but have also broader implications. In addition, we will also refer to On\nCertainty when we use Wittgenstein’s epistemology. This should serve as a starting\npoint for further more detailed research on Wittgenstein as a philosopher of\ntechnology. Our paper itself can be seen as performance and use. This is why we\ninclude the dramatic indications ‘‘Act’’ and ‘‘Scene’’ to label the headlines and sub\nheadlines. In our philosophical ‘‘performance’’ we use Wittgenstein’s philosophy of\nlanguage and his epistemology, and twist and interpret them in a way that delivers\nan interesting understanding of technology. This reﬂects Wittgenstein’s own\nunderstanding of doing philosophy: he did not so much present ‘‘arguments’’ but\nwas rather performing philosophy. The aphoristic form of his Investigations and\nother writings illustrates that philosophy cannot be put in a theoretical form; instead\nit is a reﬂexive performance—not amounting to postmodern relativism, but rather\nrelational rehearsals motivated by critical rational thinking and aware of the limits\nof rational thinking. As Friedrich Kambartel argued, these exercises should lead to\nphilosophical changes of perspectives, which show a way the reader practically\nneeds to go, but are not replaceable by a looking at a map only ( 1989: 158).\nIn our ﬁrst act we perform a perspective on Wittgenstein’s philosophy of language\nas articulated with the terms language use, language games, philosophical grammar\nand forms of life in the Investigations, and read into them a ﬁrst set of building blocks\nfor a philosophy of technology. In particular, we draw on the analogy Wittgenstein\nmakes between language use and tool use. We further develop and extend this analogy\nWittgenstein as a Philosopher of Technology: Tool Use … 167\n123\nto arrive at a view of technology use (technique) that is performative and that is\nembedded in games and forms of life. This interpretation, which is more systematic\nthan that of Winner and integrates in an original way the language use/tool use\nanalogy, is then connected to the cultural and hermeneutic interpretations of\nWittgenstein that have been made in relation to his philosophy of language.\nWe follow a similar procedure when we turn to Wittgenstein’s methodology in\nthe Philosophical Investigations and On Certainty in order to ﬁrst articulate his\nepistemology and discuss how we can use it to better understand technology. We\nshow that Wittgenstein responds to Cartesian dualistic thinking by developing a\ndeep critique of modern philosophy. Here we emphasize embodiment, know-how,\nand implicit knowledge, and then apply this to knowledge in technology use and\ntechnology performance, which, so we argue, is always part of a technological\npractice, takes place in concrete situations, involved implicit knowledge and know-\nhow, is holistic, and is embodied.\nIn the last part of the paper we take a transcendental turn: based on a conception of\nphilosophical grammar (in contrast to grammar as syntax), we interpret games, forms\nof life, and grammar as transcendental conditions that make possible and structure\nembodied use, technique, and performance. We place our use of the concept of the\ntranscendental in a Kantian trajectory, but give it a different and more radical and\npractical meaning than Kant by including ordinary language, philosophical grammar\nand forms of life. In addition (and this makes up the radicality of our paper with regard\nto Wittgenstein scholarship), we argue that if we understand language as a technology,\nWittgenstein’s theory of language use can be integrated within a larger theory of\ntechnology use and performance, interpreted in a transcendental way. This move turns\nWittgenstein into a (use and performance oriented) philosopher of technology, albeit\none who focused on language. In our conclusion, we indicate some avenues for further\nresearch in this direction and point to other aspects that need further attention such as\nthe issue of time/ﬁnitude and technology.\nUse, Games, and Forms of Life: Wittgenstein’s Philosophy of Language\nand the Performative View of Technology Use as Tool Use that Emerges\nfrom it (Act 2)\nWittgenstein’s Concepts of Language Use, Language Games, and Forms\nof Life Applied to Technology (Act 2, Scene 1)\nWittgenstein’s view of language use in the Investigations can be summarized as\nfollows. For Wittgenstein meaning is not tied to a particular word, but instead depends\non use. It is not ‘‘an aura the word brings along with it and retains in every kind of use’’\n(2009: §117/53e) but it is use that gives a sign its meaning, it’s ‘‘life’’ (2009: §432/\n135e). Moreover, this use is not stand-alone but depends on a larger social and cultural\ncontext of use, which Wittgenstein calls ‘‘language games’’ and ‘‘forms of life’’:\nI shall also call the whole, consisting of language and the activities into which\nit is woven, a ‘‘language-game’’. (2009: §7/8e)\n168 M. Coeckelbergh, M. Funk\n123\nWhen we use language, we follow certain rules. We play a game. When we learn to\nuse language, we learn these rules. But they are often not explicit. We learn by\nwatching and by participating in a game, as when we learn a board game\n(2009: §31/18e–19e). Learning a language, then, is like learning a skill and hence it\nalso involves implicit knowledge (see also the next part of the paper). But there are\nalready rules and skills that are given, and there are others who have played the\ngame before. When we speak, there is already a language, which has been used by\nothers before us, and which is linked to a broader context. Learning of particular\ngames always has a social and cultural context, of which language games are part.\nWittgenstein calls this a ‘form of life’: ‘‘to imagine a language means to imagine a\nform of life.’’ (2009: §19/11e) This view implies that meaning depends on language\nuse, and this language use is an activity and a game, which is part of a larger cultural\nwhole—a form of life. To show that ‘the speaking of language is part of an activity,\nor of a form of life’, Wittgenstein mentions a number of activities such as giving\norders, drawing, reporting, etc. (2009: §24/15e). The point is that meaning is tied to\nthese (social) activities; it is not attached to a particular sign. There is a larger\nwhole, a form of life—later in this paper these will be discussed as transcendental\ngrammars.\nWittgenstein’s primary view is a view of language. Yet indirectly, Wittgenstein\nalso says something about technology. In the Investigations, he makes an interesting\nanalogy between use of language and use of tools. To make his central point about\nmeaning being tied to language use, Wittgenstein compares the use of language to\nthe use of devices and instruments. He writes: ‘‘to invent a language could mean to\ninvent a device for a particular purpose’’ (2009: §492/145e) and ‘‘Language is an\ninstrument. Its concepts are instruments’’. (2009: §569/159e). He even explicitly\nmentions tools:\nThink of the tools in a toolbox: there is a hammer, pliers, a saw, a screwdriver,\na rule, a glue-pot, glue, nails and screws.—The functions of words are as\ndiverse as the functions of these objects. (And in both cases there are\nsimilarities.) (2009: §11/9e)\nThis analogy is usually overlooked by interpreters of Wittgenstein and philosophers\nof technology, but gives us an interesting link to thinking about technology. It\nsuggests that language is a technology, and—if we apply Wittgenstein’s view of\nlanguage use to technology—that the use of tools is also part of language games and\npart of a form of life. In other words, we can turn the metaphor around : the use of\ntools resembles the use of words.\nOur interpretation of Wittgenstein’s view of language is in line with more\n‘‘cultural’’ interpretations of Wittgenstein (e.g., Winch 1958), which stress that our\nuse of language is embedded in social behaviour, rules, and cultures. Moreover, our\nreading of Wittgenstein in terms of technology is also compatible with Langdon\nWinner’s, who already suggested that technologies are part of a form of life in the\nsense that they are ‘‘woven into the texture of everyday existence’’ (Winner 1986:\n12) and that life would be unthinkable without them. Our world becomes one with\nthat of technology. Technology cannot be ‘‘turned off’’ (1986: 12). Moreover,\nWinner stresses that there is a given. Current technological changes are variations of\nWittgenstein as a Philosopher of Technology: Tool Use … 169\n123\nolder patterns (1986: 12f.) and hence ‘‘Wittgenstein’s philosophically conservative\nmaxim ‘What has to be accepted, the given, is–so one could say–forms of life’ could\nwell be the guiding rule of a phenomenology of technical practice’’ (1986: 13). For\ninstance, the language games we play between humans such as meeting someone or\nasking a question and awaiting an answer (saying ‘‘Hello,’’ etc.) also shape our use\nof computers (1986: 13f.). Winner writes about the computers of the 1980s but what\nhe says could also be applicable to contemporary social robots:\nForms of life that we mastered before the coming of the computer shape our\nexpectations as we begin to use the instrument. ( …) We carry with us highly\nstructured anticipations about entities that appear to participate, if only\nminimally, in forms of life and associated language games that are parts of\nhuman culture. (1986: 14)\nThus, when we use technologies, this use is always embedded in activities and\npatterns that were there before the technology enters our lives. We endorse this\nview, but in our reading ﬁrmly anchor it in the analogy Wittgenstein makes between\nlanguage use and technology use (understood as tool use): the relation between\ntechnology use and forms of life is structurally similar to the relation Wittgenstein\nsees between language use and forms of life. When we use language and\ntechnology, there is already a language and there are already technologies, and there\nare already activities and cultural forms available that shape and structure these uses\nof language and technologies.\nTechnology Use, Games, and Forms of Life: A Performative View\nof Technology Use as Tool Use (Act 2, Scene 2)\nAnother way of making this point and apply Wittgenstein’s remarks on language\nand tool use to thinking about technology in general is to use the concept of\n‘performance’. Both Wittgenstein’s substantial points about language and his very\nmethodology in the Investigations and other writings can be interpreted as centring\non performance, understood as meaningful and successful practice—whether\nlinguistic or technological. Even philosophy, understood as language use, becomes a\nperformance: ‘‘We go towards the thing we mean’’ (Wittgenstein 2009: §455/140e).\nHistory of language, and hence history of thinking, is then a history of\nperformances, which have left material traces. Wittgenstein used the example of\nan old city:\nOur language can be regarded as an ancient city: a maze of little streets and\nsquares, of old and new houses, of houses with extensions from various\nperiods, and all this surrounded by a multitude of new suburbs with straight\nand regular streets and uniform houses. (Wittgenstein 2009: § 18/11e)\nIn his later work, Wittgenstein was interested in understanding why some actions\nend successful and include meaning while others lack any sense at all. His use of the\nconcepts language games and form of life, but also his epistemology focused on\ntechnique (see below), can be seen as an answer to that question: performances are\nmeaningful and successful if they are forms of skilled engagement and if these\n170 M. Coeckelbergh, M. Funk\n123\nforms are embedded in larger wholes, grammars, which constitute a kind of ‘‘given’’\nthat is usually not doubted. Performance therefore includes a pragmatic meaning\ncriterion; grasping the meaning is a matter of trial and error.\nOne cannot guess how a word functions. One has to look at its application and\nlearn from that. (Wittgenstein 2009: § 340/116e)\nNow the metaphor of performance can also be used to highlight the social and\ncultural aspects of technology use. If ‘‘individual’’ technology use and technology\nperformances are always embedded in games and a form of life, then a\nphenomenology and hermeneutics of technology should not only focus on how\nindividual subjects relate to the world via technology, but should also take into\naccount how this very relation and this use of technology is structured by games and\na form of life. Success and meaningfulness of use is socially deﬁned. When we\nperform, the success of this performance crucially depends on others, in particular\non the meaning others (spectators and co-performers) give to what we do. And those\nothers can only give meaning to our performance, if this performance is embedded\nin known activities, games, and other, larger social-cultural structures—a form of\nlife. The meaning and success of the performance, then, depends on this link with\npatterns we already know. An alien observer, so to speak, could not make sense of\nwhat we do. Our actions would not even count as a performance. For meaning to\narise and for the performance to be successful, observer (and co-performer) and\nperformer must have a shared understanding about what the activity and the game\nare about; ultimately, they it must be presupposed that they share a form of life,\nwhich makes possible that the performance can be meaningful and successful.\nThis is also applicable to performance with technology . Our performance with\ntechnology only makes sense if we already know activities and games, and a form of\nlife. This knowledge must be presupposed for the technological-performative and\ntechnological-communicative act to make sense at all, and is also a necessary\ncondition for its success. One may object that technologies have functions, which\nare rooted in their materiality. This is correct. But the function itself would not make\nsense, indeed would not count as a function at all, in isolation from a social and\ncultural context. For instance, the function of a word processor is to produce a text.\nWe perform with it in order to produce a text. Another way of saying this, is that to\nproduce a text is the word processor’s function. But the production of a text is only\nmeaningful if it is related to known activities such as writing and reading, rules such\nas grammatical rules, games such as writing an academic article, and a form of life\nthat is pervaded by a written culture and a (particular) language, which shape and\nmake possible our writing. In a culture that knew no writing (but has a culture of\norality, for instance), our word processing performance (as an activity of writing, as\na writing performance) would not make sense, and would not be successful; the\ndevice and our use of it would hence be dysfunctional. And if we were to write in\nEnglish in a social environment in which no-one understood English, then our\nperformance would also lose at least some of its functionality, if not all. Of course\none could observe the behavior of, say, a foreign tribe one does not know, and use\nthis to make sense of the language they use. But in order to give meaning to the\nbehavior, there needs to be shared behavior and, related to that, shared meaning and\nWittgenstein as a Philosopher of Technology: Tool Use … 171\n123\nshared culture. Wittgenstein writes: ‘‘Shared human behaviour is the system of\nreference by means of which we interpret an unknown language’’ (Wittgenstein\n2009, § 206: 88e). Thus, using a technology, understood as performance,\npresupposes a lot of knowledge, which is social knowledge in the sense that it is\nshared, and which may often be implicit, but which must be presupposed in order to\nguarantee success. Use of technologies thus depends on all kinds of knowledge.\nBut what does this ‘‘knowing’’ consist in? The previous argument shows that we\ndo not only need ‘‘operating’’ knowledge (knowing how to ‘‘technically’’ operate\nthe device in a narrow sense, as in ‘‘knowing how’’ to produce letters on a screen)\nbut performative knowledge in a broader sense, encompassing a lot of other\nknowledge we usually do not think about when we use a device, but which must be\npresupposed (e.g., knowing how to write, which presupposes language). But how is\nthis wider knowledge related to operating skill? And where is the material and the\nbody so far in what may seem a ‘‘cultural’’ interpretation (falsely understood as\nopposed to the material and the bodily)? In order to arrive at a more complete view\nof use of technology understood as performance, we need to pay more attention to\nembodiment and skill, and more generally to technology as technique and skill—\nrather than as artefact we use. This can be done by again using Wittgenstein, in\nparticular by interpreting his epistemology.\nEmbodied Know-How in Technology as Technique: Wittgenstein’s\nEpistemology and Its Implications for Technology Use and Performance\n(Act 3)\nEmbodiment, Situated Knowledge, Implicit Knowledge and Know-How\nin Technology Use as Technique: Wittgenstein’s Epistemology (Act 3, Scene\n1)\nLet us connect the view of technology as tool use to thinking about technique and\nskill. In philosophy in general and also in philosophy of technology there has been\nsome work on skill. For instance, Polanyi ( 1958) has famously argued that implicit\nknowledge serves as basis for scientiﬁc research in contrast to explicit knowledge.\nCapabilities which we are not able to tell (make explicit) play major roles in\nepistemic human-world relations and include perceptions as well as the usage of\nprobes and laboratory tools. In the context of critical controversies about AI\ntechnologies, Dreyfus ( 1972) emphasized the epistemic role and signiﬁcance of\nhuman bodies and skills: bodily skills serve as a basis for human cognition.\nIntelligence is not only a matter of formal calculation; it includes also tacit\ncompetences, which serve as general conceptual features of a philosophical\napproach to technology (Coeckelbergh 2012: 135f.; Irrgang 2001). Ihde ( 1979) also\ninterprets technology as practice, not as static artefact. In his understanding of\ntechnological practice, competences in using tools also play a role. In current\ncognitive sciences the enactive approach became an inﬂuential research paradigm,\nincluding bodily capacities, skills and body extensions by tools as well (Varela et al.\n1997; Noe ¨ 2004). There are also many other views in phenomenology/\n172 M. Coeckelbergh, M. Funk\n123\nhermeneutics, pragmatism or cognitive science that focus on embodiment and\nskilled engagement in cognition. Now this approach is applicable to technology use.\nMusic is a concrete example (Funk and Coeckelbergh 2013; Funk 2015) and we will\nsoon say more about music as a technological practice. Let us ﬁrst turn again to\nWittgenstein’s later work in order to link the Wittgensteinian view of technology\ndeveloped in the previous section to Wittgenstein’s epistemology, in a way that tells\nus more about technique and skill.\nIn the Investigations, Wittgenstein already says that using and learning a\nlanguage is about mastery, and suggests that this involves implicit knowledge (see\nalso Funk 2010). Consider again what Wittgenstein says about board-games:\none can also imagine someone’s having learnt the game without ever learning\nor formulating rules. He might have learned quite simple board-games ﬁrst, by\nwatching, and have progressed to more and more complicated ones. [ …]h e\nhas already mastered the game. (Wittgenstein 2009: § 31/18e, 19e)\nThis remark is entirely in line with the previously cited works on skill, tacit\nknowledge, technique, and performative knowledge. Mastery of a game can only be\nreached if one has this kind of knowledge. Moreover, in Wittgenstein we also ﬁnd\nexplicit references to mastery as technique:\nThe grammar of the word ‘‘know’’ is evidently closely related to the grammar\nof the words ‘‘can,’’ ‘‘is able to’’. But also closely related to that of the word\n‘‘understand’’ (To have ‘mastered’ a technique.). (Wittgenstein 2009:§\n150/65e)\nAnd:\nTo understand a sentence means to understand a language. To understand a\nlanguage means to have mastered a technique. (Wittgenstein 2009: § 199/87e)\nIf we apply this view to technology, then one could re-conceptualize technology use\nnot only as performance but also as technique, which requires the adequate know-\nhow and skill. We agree with Werner Kogge’s claim that Wittgenstein talks about\ntechnology in the context of procedures and (also intellectual) competences ( 2015:\n101–103). But the tacit dimension of knowledge is also emphasized by Wittgen-\nstein, who distinguishes between several forms of knowledge:\nCompare knowing and saying:\nhow many metres high Mont Blanc is\nhow the word ‘‘game’’ is used\nhow a clarinet sounds.\nSomeone who is surprised that one can know something and not be able to say\nit is perhaps thinking of a case like the ﬁrst. Certainly not of one like the third.\n(Wittgenstein 2009: § 78/41e)\nHere Wittgenstein’s view is very close to Michael Polanyi’s, in particular his\nfamous slogan: ‘‘we can know more than we can tell’’ (Polanyi 2009: 4). In On\nCertainty, a mix of Wittgenstein’s very last writings, Wittgenstein also compares\nlearning language to the learning of a skill: ‘‘We say: if a child has mastered\nWittgenstein as a Philosopher of Technology: Tool Use … 173\n123\nlanguage—and hence its application—it must know the meaning of words’’\n(Wittgenstein 1969: § 522/68e). He stresses practical knowledge:\nIf, however, there are several ways of ﬁnding something out for sure, like\ncounting, weighing, measuring the stack, then the statement ‘‘I know’’ can\ntake the place of mentioning how I know. [ …] But here there isn’t yet any\nquestion of any ‘knowledge’ that this is called ‘‘a slab,’’ this ‘‘a pillar,’’ etc.\n(Wittgenstein 1969: § 565, § 566/74e)\nInstead of certain knowledge, in the sense of something that has been measured, we\nhave tacit knowledge about concrete sounds and how to sensory perform it. We\ninfer that using words presupposes some explicit knowledge (explicit rules) but also\nimplicit knowledge: knowledge acquired by watching (listening) and participating\nin language games, by growing up in a particular form of life. But we also acquire\nknowledge by means of material performances. Applied to technology, Wittgen-\nstein’s view implies that using technology is embedded in a game in a sense that for\nusing the technology one has to perform with it, learn a particular game (e.g.,\nplaying a musical instrument etc.), and grow up in a particular cultural context (e.g.,\na musical family).\nOn Certainty is also relevant here since it includes an intellectually deep\ncontention about skepticism and the possibilities of knowledge as such, which we\ncan use to elaborate the epistemology of technology as technique. Wittgenstein\ncriticized the static ontology of Cartesian dualism and indeed its dualism itself. He\nwanted to understand knowledge not as an inner mental state but as practical\nprocess, which is immune against skeptical intervention. His point about the impact\nof tacit knowledge and his counterargument against skepticism goes beyond the\ncogito-argument (I think therefore I am) as found in Descartes. Instead it focuses on\nthe success of practice, which is also a social matter. I can have success or failure\nwhen playing with tools, language, values or ideologies—and this is a matter of\nwhat we are and do. The concrete person is always socially embedded. (Subjectivity\nis hence understood as intersubjectivity and trans subjectivity.) For technology this\nmeans that technology use is also about success in a social sense, not only in a\n‘‘technical’’ sense in the usual, narrow sense of the word. Technology is not only\nabout how we relate to the world as individuals, but has consequences for the social\nand intersubjective. This point can also be put in the language of ‘‘games’’ and\n‘‘form of life’’: a game and a form of life gives us a certain ‘‘grammar’’ for the\nsuccessful use of technology. (We will return to this point in the fourth section.)\nTo this social approach we can add the aspect of development. Consider again\nWittgenstein’s view of language, which can be interpreted in a developmental way.\nPerhaps in the beginning children or other new language users need instruction—\nthey need to hear a particular word and connect this with a particular meaning—but\nas they get better language users, and indeed if they want to become better language\nusers, they need to learn in a more implicit way and get themselves embedded in an\nentire form of life (By the way, this Wittgensteinian point also shows why it is so\ndifﬁcult for computers to translate language; algorithms and databases work with\nexplicit knowledge, whereas human language involves an implicit knowledge that\ncan only be learned as one learns language games within a speciﬁc cultural context).\n174 M. Coeckelbergh, M. Funk\n123\nSimilarly, technology can be conceptualized as technique and performance that\nrequires the development of implicit knowledge.\nMoreover, we must add the dimension of embodiment, which can be further\ndeveloped by elaborating Wittgenstein’s critique of Cartesian premises. His later\nworks are not only traversed by critical thoughts that reject a naive Cartesian\ndualism (Gier 1981: 13; Rentsch 2003, thesis 3 & 4: 15, 287ff.) in favor of a more\nsocial and cultural approach; we can also read Wittgenstein as replacing the\npostulate of Cartesian res cogitans —the process of non-physical and pure inner\ncognition—by a critical proposal of bodily and socially embedded practice.\nLinguistic meaning is no matter of isolated inner cognition, but of sensory practice:\nMisleading parallel: a cry, an expression of a pain—a sentence, an expression\nof a thought. As if the purpose of a sentence were to convey to one person how\nit is with another: only, so to speak, in his thinking apparatus, and not in his\nstomach. (Wittgenstein 2009: § 317/111e)\nCognition and thinking do not belong to an ontologically separated substance, as\nDescartes at least suggested with his argument in the Meditations; instead, in\nperformance, body and mind are together. This also means that language and\nthinking are innately linked to the body, are deeply embodied, at the level of\nperformance:\nThinking is not an incorporeal process which lends life and sense to speaking,\nand which it would be possible to detach from speaking [ …]. (Wittgenstein\n2009: § 339/116e, see also § 454/140e et passim)\nIndeed, in the Investigations, Wittgenstein constantly questions the inner-outer\ndistinction. For example, he writes that ‘‘The arrow points only in the application\nthat a living creature makes of it. This pointing is not a hocus-pocus that can be\nperformed only by the mind’’ (Wittgenstein 2009: § 454/140e) and that ‘‘An ‘inner\nprocess’ stands in need of outward criteria’’ (Wittgenstein 2009: §580/161e).\nMoreover, concrete performances depend on concrete situations, both in everyday\nlife and in methodological reconstructions: ‘‘An expectation is embedded in a\nsituation, from which it arises’’ (Wittgenstein 2009: §581/161e). Now this thought\ncan be connected with technique and embodiment. Techniques can be seen as the\nconcrete bodily skills (which we may call ‘‘innate technique’’) of using tools, which\nenable successful handling of contingent situations. Tool use plays a crucial role\nhere: not only as external physical artifact, but also in another sense: tool use\nalready starts with usage of the own human body and its capacities.\nThus, one could say that Wittgenstein raises the same question as Rene ´ Descartes\ndid three hundred years earlier: How to ﬁnd a solid ground of reasoning in\ncontention with skepticism and the possibility of radical disbelief? Descartes’\nanswer— I think, therefore I am —was to postulate two separated ontological\nsubstances: pure cognition ( res cogitans ) and physical bodies with spatial extension\n(res extensa ). Wittgenstein’s answer differs. In what we take to be a somewhat\nFeuerbachian manner (Feuerbach 1983: e.g., § 36/91), Wittgenstein’s solution can\nbe translated into the slogan: we perform, therefore we are . This also means that\nWittgenstein as a Philosopher of Technology: Tool Use … 175\n123\nthere is an epistemological basis, not in an abstract ‘‘I’’, but in a shared language,\nand in technique and performance. In On Certainty he writes:\nThat is to say, the question that we raise and our doubts depend on the fact that\nsome propositions are exempt from doubt, are as it were like hinges on which\nthose turn. (Wittgenstein 1969: § 341/44e)\nSome propositions or sentences (‘‘Sa¨ tze’’) ‘‘are exempt from doubt’’. The technical\nmetaphor Wittgenstein uses (‘‘are as it were like hinges on which those turn’’)\nillustrates the sensory postulate behind his contra skeptical argument.\nIf I want the door to turn, the hinges must stay put. (Wittgenstein 1969:§\n343/44e)\nWe can interpret this hinges example as saying something about technology use: for\nWittgenstein the use of an artefact is not an isolated inner cognition, but a ﬁnite\nbodily practice, which can succeed or fail in concrete socially shared situations.\nThese practices, performances, and techniques are thus revealed as a solid ground of\nreasoning, as something that is presupposed when we reason and which we accept\nand trust, without having explicit knowledge of it and without having certainty.\nWith pragmatic modesty Wittgenstein says:\nMy life consists in my being content to accept many things. (Wittgenstein\n1969: § 344/44e)\nAnd:\nAnd substantiation comes to an end. (Wittgenstein 1969: § 563/74e)\nOne could say that Wittgenstein re-pragmatises the Cartesian argument. Both agree\nthat something like a transcendental process (see below) serves as condition of\npossibility of skepticism and radical doubts. Our acceptance of many things makes\npossible our doubt in the ﬁrst place. But in contrast to Descartes, Wittgenstein\nlocates this transcendental ground and process not in an ontologically separated\nsphere of pure cognition, but in praxis. Everyday life practice and performance in all\nits manifold bodily and sensory potentials serves (a) as condition of possibility of\nskepticism as such, and (b) as axiom or transcendental ground (or condition of\npossibility) of any form of knowledge and scientiﬁc research:\nThat is to say, it belongs to the logic of our scientiﬁc investigations that certain\nthings are in deed not doubted. (Wittgenstein 1969: § 342/44e)\nCertain things (‘‘Gewisses’’) are not doubted in deed (‘‘in der Tat’’). ‘‘In deed’’\nmeans in concrete practice and performance. Having doubts is itself a process or\npractice. Descartes attends to this doubting. But in contrast to Descartes,\nWittgenstein has a sensory and bodily technical understanding of this process.\nFor scientiﬁc research, for instance, this means that there is also trust in the\ntechnology used:\nIf I make an experiment I do not doubt the existence of the apparatus before\nmy eyes. (Wittgenstein 1969: § 337/43e)\n176 M. Coeckelbergh, M. Funk\n123\nThe apparatus—the technology as tool and device, or as the assemblage of tools and\ndevices—here points to science as a technological practice which enables\nexperimentation. In a modern understanding of experimental sciences, which today\nalso include performances in high tech laboratories and computer models, this\ntechnological embedding of succeeding or failing experiments serves as a solid\nground and process for methodological reasoning. It is not the logical sentence or\nnatural law as such.\nOur talk gets its meaning from the rest of our proceedings. (Wittgenstein 1969:\n§ 229/30e)\nIt is precisely this counter-skeptical movement in combination with the classical\nWittgensteinian argument about language (linguistic meaning is generated in\npractice) that enables not only conceptual links between philosophy of language and\nphilosophy of technology, but also bears methodological potentials for philosophy\nof technology as discipline. We already used the term ‘‘conditions of possibility’’\nhere; in the last part of this paper, we will further develop this argument as a\ntranscendental argument . But let us ﬁrst further show the implications of this\nepistemological analysis for thinking about technology.\nEmbodiment, Situated Knowledge, Implicit Knowledge and Know-How\nin Technology Use/Performance as Technique: Implications for Thinking\nabout Technology (Act 3, Scene 2)\nWhat does it mean to say that technology, understood as technique and\ntechnological practice (and not only as artefact or ‘‘thing’’), involves the kind of\nimplicit, embodied knowledge and skill Wittgenstein wrote about? Learning to use\ntechnology requires learning a skill. Perhaps we need instruction in the beginning,\nbut as we gain mastery, we have more implicit knowledge, know-how, which is in\nturn embedded in games and forms of life. The latter cannot be made entirely\nexplicit but ‘‘live’’ in the socially shared know-how and performance.\nLet us offer the example of music to explain this. Music is a form of life and\ninvolves more than only adding some isolated techniques or handbook knowledge to\nan already existing game of life. Learning music includes a broad range of trainings:\nbody movements, harmonic theories, scores, very material perceptions, ﬁnger styles\nor aural training. Social aspects also play a crucial role. Often music is embedded in\ncommon, transsubjective performances in rehearsal rooms, studios, stages etc. Skills\nare shared and succeeding ways of talking about those skills are shared as well.\nMusic is always more than scores and it is embedded in a grammar which is more\nthan harmonic theory. Aural training changes sensory skills such as ﬁnger training.\nAt the same time perceptions changes, we feel, hear or see more things or at least in\na different way. And this can succeed or fail. Not the score serves as a truth and\nmeaning criterion here, but the performance and the way of life which includes\nadoptions of how to interpret the score in a succeeding performance. Succeeding\nrepetition, for instance in many training sessions, is the basis of implicit knowledge.\nNo-one can become a musician without practice and rehearsal (And beginners need\ninstruction). Moreover, even if music is not literally performed with others, music as\nWittgenstein as a Philosopher of Technology: Tool Use … 177\n123\ntechnique is embedded within a larger form of life, which includes patterns and\nculture that shape the practice, for instance rock music-culture.\nSome references to Wittgenstein and technology can be found in philosophy and\nsocial sciences 1 of music, especially when musical instruments are analyzed and not\nonly scores with a theoretical or historical interest. For example, Trevor Pinch uses\nWittgenstein in order explain how applicability in several user situations challenged\nthe design process of early Moog synthesizers and their transformation into\nkeyboards: ‘‘Just as Wittgenstein famously argued that the meaning of language\ncomes from use—so too the meaning of musical instruments is to be found in their\nuse’’ (Pinch2006: 58). In another study Pinch and Trocco argue:\nWittgenstein famously argued that the way to understand language is from its\nuse. Similarly, the way to understand musical instruments is not from their\nessences—what their theoretical possibilities are—but from the way people\nwho actually make the music put them into practice. (Pinch and Trocco 2004:\n10)\nWe propose to generalize this claim to technology use in general: we can only\nunderstand technologies in and from their use, that is, in technological practice,\nwhich is also culture-in-practice.\nThis use orientation also enables us to point to the link between the materiality of\ntechnologies and cultures of use. Artefacts in use are material carriers of forms of\nlife. If they do not ﬁt into or further develop an already existing set of practices,\ntechnological innovations will fail. Innovation, technological use and success, and\nmaterial embedding of cultural habits belong together. Again Moog synthesizers are\nexamples for that. They have been successful partly because of their material\nembodiment: their materiel representation/embodiment of Classical music as the\nkeyboard follows exactly the geometry of black and white keys as it can also be\nfound in usual pianos. Similar to typewriters and computer keyboards (David 1985)\nsynthesizers and pianos are linked by a material developmental path: the keyboard\nas constant user interface that enables successful innovations ﬁtting into already\nestablished forms of life.\nIn his study of Listening and Voice , Don Ihde also sees musical technologies as\npractice in concrete cultural situations. He refers to Wittgenstein when he describes\n1 There is a diverse and multifaceted discussion about Wittgenstein in more empirical contexts of\nsociology and STS studies. Our paper follows a primary philosophical interest. But at this point we also\nwant to acknowledge that our claims regarding technologies and forms of life, social aspects of\nknowledge, tool use and tacit knowledge are compatible to several other approaches in the social sciences\nthat use Wittgenstein to understand scientiﬁc practices and knowledge production. Consider for example\nSteven Shapins and Simon Schaffers’s inﬂuential Leviathan and the Air -Pump: Hobbes, Boyle, and the\nExperimental Life (1985, e.g.,: 15, 51) which uses the notion of ‘form of life’ to talk about the technology\nof the airpump, or David Bloor’s Wittgenstein: A Social Theory of Knowledge (1983) and Wittgenstein,\nRules and Institutions (1997). And for instance Collins ( 1974) has done work on how tacit knowledge\nplays a role in science (see also the special issue by Soler and Zwart 2013). Michael Lynch has also used\nand discussed Wittgenstein in his work, for instance the use of rules in Scientiﬁc Practice and Ordinary\nAction (1993; see also 1997). Due to reasons of space we cannot go into the details at this point. But it\ncould be a fruitful future work to combine our philosophical claims about Wittgenstein and technologies\nwith those more empirically oriented works.\n178 M. Coeckelbergh, M. Funk\n123\nthe ways in which philosophers and artists discern different possibilities and\nvariations in relation to the phenomena:\nThere is a sense in which Wittgenstein in particular was sensitive to such\nnuances of differences in a very ‘‘phenomenological’’ way. The notion of\nfamily resemblances [ …] is an attempt to recognize the noncommon\nrelatedness of many phenomena in the mesh of ordinary language that does\nnot display simply some clear ‘‘logical’’ structure. (Ihde 2007: 33f.)\nThis remark on language takes us back to the insights of the ﬁrst part of this paper.\nFor philosophy of technology, this Wittgensteinian approach means that part of its\ncentral tasks must be the hermeneutic work of relating particular uses of technology\nto activities, games, and larger social-cultural wholes, forms of life—which include\nmaterial aspects as well. If we must put this in dualistic terms at all: the ‘‘material’’\nmust be related to the ‘‘cultural’’. This approach does not mean that we must give up\nan interest in the material aspects of technologies, in ‘things’, but rather that we\nmust relate the particular use of particular things, including their material aspects, to\nactivities and games, and more generally to a social and cultural context.\nUnderstanding technology, then, means understanding a form of life, and this\nincludes technique and the use of all kinds of tools—linguistic, material, and others.\nThen the main question for a Wittgensteinian philosophy of technology applied to\ntechnology development and innovation is: what will the future forms of life,\nincluding new technological developments, look like, and how might this form of\nlife be related to historical and contemporary forms of live? Moreover, we can\nmerge this Wittgensteinian question and approach with a more pro-active approach,\nwhich is increasingly popular in contemporary philosophy of technology and largely\nconstructed in response to Heidegger rather than Wittgenstein (starting, e.g., with\nDreyfus 1972; Ihde 1979): can we re-design, develop new, technologies that lead to\na kind of form of life we think is valuable and meaningful for humans? This\ndevelopment includes trial and error: we can perform more sentences and perform\nmore technical actions, than those, which we would call ‘‘meaningful’’ or associate\nwith a succeeding technical move. Furthermore, others also perform, make moves,\nuse words, and so on. The interesting question is then how to respond to others, for\ninstance: how do we learn to enfold/bear out of ourselves a point of view, which\nlinks our personal linguistic and technical potentials to the many sometimes strange\nand interesting, sometimes trivial things performed by other persons? The question\nhow to relate to technology then means: how do we relate to the games and form of\nlife in which we perform and live? How is success in human life possible? What are\nthe conditions of possibility? This question leads us to a transcendental argument,\nwhich recognizes that we are always carried by a form of life, which makes possible\ntechnological and other uses and performances, and which cannot easily be\nchanged.\nWittgenstein as a Philosopher of Technology: Tool Use … 179\n123\nA Transcendental Interpretation (Act 4)\nLet us now further support and re-formulate our interpretations and arguments in the\npreceding parts of the paper by taking an explicit transcendental turn, albeit giving\n‘‘transcendental’’ a speciﬁc meaning which differs from, say, Kant or Husserl. This\nmove will also enable us to further elaborate what we take to be Wittgenstein’s\napproach to philosophy and its implications for doing philosophy of technology.\nA Transcendental Turn (Act 4, Scene 1)\nIn the preceding part, we have been focusing shared social and bodily processes in\nsucceeding situations as a pragmatic ground against skepticism. We also linked this\nback to the ﬁrst part of the paper, stressing that our performances with technology\nare always embedded and constrained by a form of life. In these performances, we\nalready touched upon the transcendental argument (we mentioned conditions of\npossibility), but this needs to be further elaborated in this section. In order to make\nthis transcendental turn, let us begin with the concept of ‘‘process’’. What does\nprocess mean? Process is a matter of practice and has something to do with time.\nAnd it is the question of time in Augustine’s Confessions that gets Wittgensteins\nstarted in the Investigations:\nAugustine: ‘‘What, then, is time? If no one asks me, I know what it is. If I wish\nto explain it to him who asks me, I do not know’’ (Augustine 1955: 162 [Conf.\nXI 14]).\nWittgenstein’s response to this is not only to point to the use of words, as we already\nindicated earlier in this paper, but also to stress implicit knowledge again and to\nsuggest a paradox:\nNot, however, as if to this end we had to hunt out new facts; it is, rather,\nessential to our investigation that we do not seek to learn anything new by it.\nWe want to understand something that is already in plain view. For this is\nwhat we seem in some sense not to understand. Augustine says in Confessions\nXI. 14, ‘‘quid est ergo tempus? si nemo ex me quaerat scio; si quaerenti\nexplicare velim, nescio’’.—This could not be said about a question of natural\nscience (‘‘What is the speciﬁc gravity of hydrogen?’’, for instance). Something\nthat one knows when nobody asks one, but no longer knows when one is asked\nto explain it, is something that has to be called to mind . (And it is obviously\nsomething which, for some reason, it is difﬁcult to call to mind.) (Wittgenstein\n2009: § 89/47e)\nIt is hard to call this ‘something that one knows when nobody asks one, but no\nlonger knows when one is asked to explain it’ into mind, because it is not the\nopposite of the mind. Any opposite or strong difference can turn more easily into\nepistemic focus, because of a strong distinction (contrast). But here we are not\nconfronted with a strong distinction. What we ﬁnd in this investigation is a\ntranscendental condition of possibility of the process: we try to call to mind, but we\n180 M. Coeckelbergh, M. Funk\n123\ncan only relate what is already related (Rentsch 2003, thesis 6: 16; Coeckelbergh\n2012: 138). The paradox is: we do not know but we already know .\nIn order to systematically elaborate a philosophical solution of this paradox, we\npropose to interpret Wittgenstein and our own interpretations and argument offered\nin this paper in a transcendental way. In the process, we further develop existing\ninterpretations of Wittgenstein that focus a transcendental argument (Gier 1980:\n257; Gier 1990: 280, 285; Rentsch 2003: 291ff., 340ff.; Benton 2002: 155;\nCoeckelbergh 2012: 133–138) but use, enhance and elaborate them in order to offer\nnew methodological impulses for the philosophy of technology.\nOne of Wittgensteins statements directly suggests a transcendental interpretation\nof his views:\nyet our investigation is directed not towards phenomena, but rather, as one\nmight say, towards the ‘possibilities’ of phenomena. [ …] Our inquiry is\ntherefore a grammatical one. (Wittgenstein 2009: § 90/47e)\nThe crucial words here are not only ‘‘possibilities’’ (transcendental approaches\nfocus on conditions of possibility) but also ‘‘grammar’’. Let us try to understand\nWittgenstein’s concept of a philosophical grammar—also called existential\ngrammar (Rentsch 2003: 417ff.)—in order to understand how Wittgenstein\ntransforms the Kantian notion of transcendental.\nWittgenstein is not a postmodern philosopher. He is deeply rooted in modern\nthinking by radically emphasizing scientiﬁc enlightenment and critique of reason\n(‘‘Vernunftkritik’’) in the tradition of Immanuel Kant (Kambartel 1989: 148–150).\nIn a Kantian manner, Wittgenstein argues for a categorical difference between\nsituation invariant and situation variant sentences. But more than Kant, Wittgenstein\nwas focusing on language practice. Language practice of sciences—natural but also\nsocial science or engineering sciences—are shaped by situation invariant ways of\nusing language. Sentences, hypotheses or natural laws are intended to be valid at\nany time in any place. Therefore, those practices of talking are independent from the\nconcrete situation in which the sentence is practically performed. On the other hand,\neveryday life language is—to put it into 21st century terms—multistable. Words are\nmultistable, for example the word ‘‘mouse’’. It could refer to a computer input\ndevice or to a speciﬁc mammal. The same happens with the tool computer mouse.\nIts application is open to abuse many variations: for gaming, design, social\ninteraction in social media, or as weapon in cyberwar. In the philosophy of\ntechnology, Ihde often refers to this concept. In his very few Wittgenstein\nreferences, he mentions Thomas Kuhn and the duck-rabbit picture (gestalt shifts),\nwhich looks like a duck and a rabbit at the same time (Ihde 1991: 14–16; Ihde 2006:\n288). For our purposes, it is important to highlight the conceptual parallel between\nthe multistability of technologies and language, and its innate links: the word\n‘‘mouse’’ received an additional meaning after personal computers and pursuant\nsoftware became aspects of new situations of performances. Apparently different\nmeanings (gestalts) are possible, and technology makes possible different meanings.\nThis insight brings us back to Wittgensteins claim about grammar. The innate\ngrammar of ordinary language is specialized to practically handle manifold\ncontingent circumstances. Whereas scientiﬁc language enfolds its meaning in very\nWittgenstein as a Philosopher of Technology: Tool Use … 181\n123\npeculiar scientiﬁc situations, everyday life language is embedded in multiple\npossibilities of genuine human actions (Kambartel 1989: 155–158). Linguistic\nactions shape practical forms of human life, and our use of language is made\npossible by a form of life. Whereas Kant used the more legal term ‘‘constitution,’’\nWittgenstein introduced the linguistic term ‘‘grammar’’ in order to conceptualize\nthis (Kambartel 1989: 149, 156). There is a transcendental grammar that makes\npossible and shapes concrete uses of language. Now we add that technology, and not\nonly language, can be part of such a transcendental grammar . Moreover, grammar\nmust also be understood in a process way. Let us unpack this view by further\nanalyzing the notion of ‘‘grammar’’.\nTranscendental Grammar (Act 4, Scene 2)\nSurface Grammar Versus Depth Grammar\nWhen Wittgenstein uses the term ‘‘grammar,’’ he does not mean a linguistic set of\nrules of how to create sentences in a certain language formally correct. He is\nintending a philosophical grammar, which emphasizes meaning. A formally wrong\nsentence can still include meaning when it is successfully applied in a\ncommunicative situation. On the other hand, even formally correct sentences could\nbe used in an incorrect way—without a genuine meaning and sense (Kambartel\n1989: 61). For example could a computer program or a bot in a social media account\ncreate a set of correct sentences without any appropriate sense of meaning.\nPhilosophical grammar is thus more than rules of correct syntax. Wittgenstein\ndifferentiates between surface grammar and depth grammar:\nIn the use of words, one might distinguish ‘surface grammar’ from ‘depth\ngrammar’. What immediately impresses itself upon us about the use of a word\nis the way it is used in the sentence structure, the part of its use—one might\nsay—that can be taken in by the ear.—And now compare the depth grammar,\nsay of the verb ‘‘to mean’’, with what its surface grammar would lead us to\npresume. No wonder one ﬁnds it difﬁcult to know one’s way about.\n(Wittgenstein 2009: § 664/176e-177e)\nThe meaningful use of the word ‘‘meaning’’ is on the level of depth grammar more\nthan its appearance in an acoustic surface or a formal rule that regulates its adequate\nposition in a sentence. What Wittgenstein calls depth grammar is a transcendental\ngrammar:\nThis ﬁnds expression in the question of the essence of language, of\npropositions, of thought.—For although we, in our investigations, are trying\nto understand the nature of language—its function, its structure—yet this is\nnot what that question has in view. For it sees the essence of things not as\nsomething that already lies open to view, and that becomes surveyable through\na process of ordering, but as something that lies beneath the surface.\nSomething that lies within, which we perceive when we see right into the\nthing, and which an analysis is supposed to unearth. ‘The essence is hidden\n182 M. Coeckelbergh, M. Funk\n123\nfrom us’: this is the form our problem now assumes. We ask: ‘‘What is\nlanguage?,’’ ‘‘What is a proposition?’’ And the answer to these questions is to\nbe given once for all, and independently of any future experience.\n(Wittgenstein 2009: § 92/48e)\nThe questions what language, proposition or sentence (‘‘German: Satz’’) are, is not\nan empirical question. Trying to answer these questions leads to insights in depth\ngrammar, and therefore in conditions of possibilities of ‘‘any future experience’’.\nKeeping in mind our previous interpretations in terms of performance and our\nemphasis on process, we propose to interpret transcendental depth grammar as the\ngrammar of human performances—performances that are more than language and\nenable meaningful usage of words (remember, e.g., the situation in §2 of the\nInvestigations).\nFurthermore, in response to Wittgenstein, we now propose to expand the\nmeaning of ‘‘transcendental’’ conditions of possibilities and ‘‘grammar’’ beyond\nlanguage, thereby including technology. There is a body grammar as well as a\ngrammar of colors or of technological artifacts. Technology, understood as tool use\nand as technique, is also a condition of possibility, also constitutes a depth grammar.\nTool use understood as involving innate technique is a bodily sensory grammar of\nsuccessful, meaningful and socially shared practice and performance. This implies\nthat on a grammatical level, skill, understanding and knowledge belong together.\nPerformance is about skilled use of words, body, and tools, and this is only possible\nin a meaningful way and in a successful way if and since there is already a socially\nand culturally shared whole of largely implicit know-how that forms the linguistic,\nbodily, and technological ‘‘grammar’’ which shapes and makes possible a particular\nuse-performance. It is only possible since there is this grammar we know, but when\nasked about it we cannot (fully) make explicit. We knowhow, we have solutions. As\nindividuals, we do not describe or prescribe, we do not create meaning; the grammar\ndescribes and prescribes our uses-performances, and the giving meaning and the\nmaking of meaning is always already embedded in a know-how and meaning that is\ngiven.\nDescriptive and Normative Performances: Wittgenstein’s Philosophy and Beyond\nDoes this mean that this grammar is unchangeable? Wittgenstein tends to follow a\ndescriptive understanding of philosophy and thereby also a descriptive claim about\nphilosophical grammar:\nGrammar does not tell us how language must be constructed in order to fulﬁl\nits purpose, in order to have such-and-such an effect on human beings. It only\ndescribes, and in no way explains, the use of signs. (Wittgenstein 2009:§\n496/146e)\nAnd:\nPhilosophy must not interfere in any way with the actual use of language, so it\ncan in the end only describe it. For it cannot justify it either. It leaves\neverything as it is. (Wittgenstein 2009: § 124/55e)\nWittgenstein as a Philosopher of Technology: Tool Use … 183\n123\nFrom an ethical and political point of view, this seems to amount to fatalism. On the\none hand, we can agree with Wittgenstein’s therapeutic point that philosophers\nshould not overestimate their syntactic power, i.e., not create formal pseudo\nproblems, and instead stay more on the ground of real life—even if the syntax of\nreal life is sometimes not logical. Philosophy should also not explain: ‘‘Philosophy\njust puts everything before us, and neither explains nor deduces anything. ( …) The\nname ‘philosophy’ might also be given to what is possible before all new\ndiscoveries and inventions’’ (Wittgenstein 2009: § 126/55e). In this ‘‘before’’ we\nmeet Wittgenstein’s interest in the transcendental again: philosophy, it seems, is\nthen a performance, a way to go, which focuses on the conditions of possibility of\ndiscoveries, inventions and theories.\nNow one could try to describe the shared grammar, the form of life, by means of\ntheses. But then what is the point, since everyone would agree?\nIf someone were to advance theses in philosophy, it would never be possible to\ndebate them, because everyone would agree to them. (Wittgenstein 2009:§\n128/56e)\nWhen philosophy proclaims a thesis, the real important work already has been done:\nnot by philosophers, but in practice and performance. This work might result in a\nthesis, but cannot be replaced by the thesis as such: the thesis is made possible by a\ntranscendental performance of understanding a new perspective after several\nprocesses of socially shared ways of trial and error. At this point the thesis is already\nestablished and not controversial; there is already a transcendental basis of\nculturally and socially shared knowledge, a common ground and process (or indeed\na common sense). In this sense, Wittgenstein is right to say that:\nIn philosophy no inferences are drawn. ‘‘But it must be like this!’’ is not a\nphilosophical proposition. Philosophy only states what everyone concedes to\nit. (Wittgenstein 2009: § 599/165e)\nThis does not mean that everyone agrees about everything; rather, it is agreement\n‘‘not in opinions, but rather in form of life’’ (Wittgenstein 2009: § 241/94e). That is,\nit is not an explicit agreement; Wittgenstein’s claim is not about explicit but implicit\nknowledge. The transcendental base and process as a form of life is given and\nusually not doubted or debated—if it can be made explicit at all.\nOn the other hand, Wittgenstein does not create much room for normative\nperformances, it seems, and at the very least we need to do work of interpretation to\nbring out this normative dimension. An objection to what seems Wittgenstein’s\nfatalism can be found in Winner (1989: 16f.), who stresses the normative dimension\nof Wittgenstein’s description:\nWhatever their shortcomings, however, the philosophies of Marx and\nWittgenstein share a fruitful insight: the observation that social activity is\nan ongoing process of world-making. [ …] From this point of view, the\nimportant question about technology becomes, As we ‘‘make things work,’’\nwhat kind of world are we making? (Winner 1989: 17)\n184 M. Coeckelbergh, M. Funk\n123\nIf technology can be described as world making, then we can ask the normative\nquestion about what world we should be making and thus ask about the political and\nethical aspects of technological performances and practices. This takes us beyond\nWittgenstein. Consider for instance the ethical and societal challenges raised by\ntalking robots and other talking machines. As they enter our everyday forms of life,\nwhat kind of world are we making? Wittgenstein discusses handcraft tools (2009: §\n11/9e, 10e) or industrialized technologies like steam boilers (2009: § 466/141e,\n142e), mostly in analogies to language use, but always as technologies that do not\ntalk to the users. But what about talking machines? Social robots are designed as\nsocially interacting systems with manifold capabilities for linguistic interactions\n(Breazeal 2002). These social robots become active systems for verbal communi-\ncation and therefore inﬂuence human linguistic habits more than non-talking tools.\nEngineers started designing social interaction and language. This means that values\nare also designed—at least very subtly—and they become, through our uses and\nperformances, ‘‘injected’’ in our human language games and forms of life. Perhaps\nsome meanings and values are ampliﬁed, whereas others are downplayed.\nMoreover, based on our analysis of grammar we can ask: engineers design syntax\nfor verbal communication, but it is questionable if social robots can play language\ngames in a richer, Wittgensteinian depth-grammatical sense. It may seem that their\nuse of language rests mainly on a syntactical knowledge base which is\nepistemologically not the same as existential depth grammar or a form of life.\nCan those systems really play language games or follow a grammar in the non-\nsyntactical meaning, or are they restricted to explicit knowledge and syntactical\ngrammar, leaving out a crucial part of transcendental grammar, of the games and the\nform of life? One might reply that by connecting robots to the internet and thus\nbringing in human meanings, engineers try to embed them in a form of life and in\ngames, and that through use they become more embedded in such games and form\nof life. Moreover, social robots will inﬂuence the ways we play and maybe the rules\nwe follow; the form of life is not entirely unchangeable, and technology plays a role\nin this changing. We thus acknowledge that this issue is not an either/or question.\nNevertheless, in so far as robots lack a lot of implicit knowledge and do not\nsufﬁciently ‘‘hinge’’ on a form of life, there is still a discrepancy between the talking\nof the robot and the talking of humans—the latter is much richer since better\nanchored in a broader transcendental base, in concrete skilled human performances\nand in a full form of life. More generally, if there are indeed these kinds of\nproblems, then the slogan that philosophy ‘‘leaves everything as it is’’ becomes\nethically dangerous. As talking robots become part of everyday situations in which\nwe (including children) play and learn language games, philosophers of technology\nshould ask what games we should play and what world we are making; we should\nethically evaluate what is happening. This happening affects the grammars forms of\nlife, which also have a transcendental status.\nWittgenstein as a Philosopher of Technology: Tool Use … 185\n123\nForms of Life as Transcendental Conditions and Performances (Act 4,\nScene 3)\nLet us say more about the term ‘‘form of life’’ and the relation between language\nand technology. As we have shown, Winner adapts the Wittgensteinian term form of\nlife (see also Nordmann 2015: 62–64). Technologies alter patterns of human actions\nand institutions, and enable variations of social roles. At the same time, technologies\nare embedded in, and shaped by, forms of life. But in contrast to Winner, we have\nanchored our use of the term in the analogy between language use and technology\nuse (as tool use) drawn by Wittgenstein, and we propose to interpret Wittgenstein’s\nand Winner’s claim about forms of life as a transcendental one. Technology use and\nperformance is made possible by forms of life, and these forms of life are\nconstituted by performances—performance which, like language, have hence also a\ntranscendental role. Thus, there is already a grammar, and this grammar is linguistic\nand technological—with technology understood as technique and performance.\nMusic is again a good example since it involves these different kinds of grammar:\nthe syntactical grammar of musical language/logic, for example, but also the\ngrammar and games of styles, and indeed the depth grammar of an entire music\nculture, such as the rock culture, which constitutes a form of life. In the context of\nmusic technologies, Ihde also refers to Wittgenstein and the culturally embedded\ngrammar of music:\nInversely, there is an analogous sense in which music also has a ‘‘grammar’’\nand a style. No one mistakes the Rolling Stones for Mozart, neither do the\nmore learned mistake Handel for Haydn. Yet all of these musical ‘‘grammars’’\nare closer together than the strange ‘‘grammar’’ of gliding, complex, and\nstylized pieces of Indian music which to the beginner ﬁrst often appear as not\neven ‘‘music’’. (Ihde2007: 157)\nStyle and grammar in turn depend on techniques and games like playing distorted\ne-guitar (Rolling Stones) and classical orchestra (Mozart) or different tonal systems\nand instruments like sitars (Indian Raga music). Grammar and technique, social\nsharing and language, characterize the embodiment of musical cultures. More\ngenerally, we can conclude that there is already a grammar which shapes our use of\ntechnologies, in music and elsewhere. But, interestingly, this also holds vice versa:\ntechnology also alters our language (use) and hence our thinking. This is how\nWinner summarizes the value of Wittgensteins thoughts for philosophy of\ntechnology:\nWittgenstein points to a vast multiplicity of cultural practices that comprise\nour common world. Asking us to notice ‘‘what we say when,’’ his approach\ncan help us recognize the way language reﬂects the content of technical\npractice. It makes sense to ask, for example, how the adoption of digital\ncomputers might alter the way people think of their own faculties and\nactivities. If Wittgenstein is correct, we would expect that changes of this kind\nwould appear, sooner or later, in the language people use to talk about\nthemselves. (Winner 1989: 15)\n186 M. Coeckelbergh, M. Funk\n123\nAnother way of saying this, is that technologies—understood as tool use, technique,\nand performance—shape the grammar of thinking. Hence, considered from the\nperspective of transcendental grammar, there are deep parallels and connections\nbetween language and technology. In line with Wittgenstein, we must reject\ndualistic thinking in this matter. Language and technology, bound together in\nperformance and in transcendental processes, should not be separated. This is also\napplicable to the relation between music and language (or logic). As Ihde puts it:\nThere is a sense in which, phenomenologically, spoken language is at least as\n‘‘musical’’ as it is ‘‘logical,’’ and if we have separated sound from meaning,\nthen two distinct directions of inquiry are opened and opposed. But in voiced\nword music and logic are incarnate. No ‘‘pure’’ music nor ‘‘pure’’ meaning\nmay be found. (Ihde 2007: 157)\nIn contrast to Ihde, however, we argue in a more conﬁdently Wittgensteinian vein\nthat musical grammars and cultural embodiments in music, but also music\ntechnologies, constitute transcendental forms of life. For example, the e-guitar\nbecomes a condition of possibility of how to talk with and about music. Of course\nthere is a concrete artifact, such as a Stratocaster guitar or tube ampliﬁer. But there\nare also concrete skills that are enabled by these instruments and at the same time\nshape the possibilities of how to use it—what we called ‘‘innate technique’’—and on\nthe link between these skills and techniques and the form of life as a transcendental\ncondition. Before a musician starts playing and performing, there is already a form\nof life which provides grammars that make possible the playing and shape particular\nperformances, techniques, and styles. These grammars can change. Consider the\nhistory of rock music, understood as a history of technology—the history of the\nelectric guitar. For instance, initially the transcendental forms of life of classical\nmusicians shaped the performances of many early e-guitarists. But as more the\nelectric guitar became an established everyday life instrument, the more younger\nguitarists developed and adopted own ways of playing these instruments—mostly in\nrock’n roll like styles. These styles became step by step new conditions of\npossibilities, both in performing music and in performing the own life. With the\ndifferent technology, different skills and techniques, musical styles, and language,\nthere was not only new music; a new form of life emerged. The 1960th hippie\nmovements or later punk were examples of this; as (sub)cultures they can be seen as\ntranscendental conditions: a holistic socially shared grammar of how to make music,\ntalk to each other, and lead one’s life, which itself has the character of process and\nperformance. Transcendental performances and form(s) of life holistically condi-\ntioned technological practices, games, and activities like eating, wearing clothes,\nhair styles or body languages, in which people became enmeshed. The form of life\nbecame varied and changed. Wittgenstein also points to diversity:\nThere are countless kinds; countless different kinds of use of all the things we\ncall ‘‘signs,’’ ‘‘words,’’ ‘‘sentences’’. And this diversity is not something ﬁxed,\ngiven once for all; but new types of language, new language-games, as we\nmay say, come into existence, and others become obsolete and get forgotten.\n[…] The word ‘‘language-game’’ is used here to emphasize the fact that the\nWittgenstein as a Philosopher of Technology: Tool Use … 187\n123\nspeaking of language is part of an activity, or of a form of life. (Wittgenstein\n2009: § 23/14e,15e)\nIn this paper, we emphasized that technology, understood as tool use and as\ntechnique and skill, plays a crucial performative and transcendental role in this kind\nof change. The mentioned activities depend on settings, circumstances and concrete\nsituations that are shaped by technology as a transcendental condition of possibility.\nConsider what Wittgenstein writes about chess:\nAn intention is embedded in a setting, in human customs and institutions. If\nthe technique of the game of chess did not exist, I could not intend to play a\ngame of chess. (Wittgenstein 2009: § 337/115e)\nThis can be generalized to all technological practices. Technology plays a\ntranscendental role here: there is already a form of life, there is already a grammar,\nwhich is at the same time linguistic-cultural and technological-cultural, and which\nmakes possible and shapes particular moves, performances, and games.\nConclusion: Wittgenstein as a Philosopher of Technology (Act 5\nand Final Act)\nWe used Wittgensteinian terms such as games and form of life, but we also\nintroduced new terms such as innate technique and transcendental technology and\nperformance to reﬂect on how technologies are more than artefacts or functions. As\ntechnologies are used, as we perform with technologies, as we learn skills and\ntechnique in the process of using technologies, technologies are shaped and made\npossible by larger grammars, by a form of life, and are in turn also constitutive of\nthis transcendental conditions and transcendental whole, understood as process and\nperformance. This means that technology, as tool and technique, is always more\nthan a mere instrument. Deeply linked to our shared meanings and shared\nperformances, it shapes our activities, our thinking, and our existence, and cannot be\nisolated from our form of life. Neither can we isolate it from use of language and\nfrom logic—if a distinction is meaningful at all. Language and technology are\nstrongly entangled: in use and technique, and in their role as transcendental\nconditions.\nBased on the previous arguments and interpretations, we therefore propose to\nrevise current approaches to phenomenology and hermeneutics of technology,\nincluding postphenomenology, in a way that takes more into account the\nWittgensteinian insight that technology is not just about ‘things’ but also about\nuse of things and performance with things. We believe that this approach opens up\nan approach to understanding technologies that (1) relates particular technologies to\nthe activities, games, and form of life they are part of and on which their use and\nperformance depends, (2) pays more attention to, and acknowledges, the importance\nof skill, technique and implicit knowledge in the use of tools, and (3) can be\nhelpfully connected to a transcendental interpretation of Wittgenstein’s concepts\ngames and forms of life.\n188 M. Coeckelbergh, M. Funk\n123\nWith our example of talking robots, we have also suggested that this approach\ncan inform an ethics and politics of technology, but more research is needed to\ndevelop this point. Further work is also needed to elaborate a Wittgensteinian\nepistemology of technology. Research that further develops and applies the\ninterpretations and arguments in this essay may include topics such as time, ﬁnitude\nand technology, technology and games, technology skills and implicit knowledge,\ntechnology and language, artistic performance, epistemology of music, ethics of\ntechnologies, relations between ethical, philosophical and technological grammar,\nrelations between Wittgenstein and other philosophers (Heidegger, Husserl,\nMerleau-Ponty, Plessner, etc.), engagement with thinkers from the social sciences\nsuch as Latour, and so on. For example, one may compare Heidegger’s notion of\nenframing (Heidegger 1977) to Wittgenstein’s notion ‘form of life’. We suggest that\nthe concept ‘form of life’ could serve to capture two kinds of approaches: one that\nemploys the notion of ‘enframing,’ which refers to a more general meaning of\ntechnology and technological culture, and one that zooms in on the uses and\nmeanings of speciﬁc technologies. We can try to understand our modern form of life\nand we can study the link between a speciﬁc technology-in-use and larger\ntechnological-cultural wholes. The term ‘form of life’ can thus help to render both\napproaches compatible.\nAs these examples suggest, our interpretations and arguments are not only\nrelevant to philosophy of technology; the topic of Wittgenstein and technology\ndeserves wider attention in the philosophical community. In the course of our paper,\nwe have engaged with Wittgenstein and with important epistemological questions\nconcerning knowledge and doubt, and we have highlighted how Wittgenstein and\nour interpretations of Wittgenstein stand in the philosophical tradition. With a\nradical intention and gesture, we have been presenting a transcendental interpre-\ntation which constructed Wittgenstein as a continuator of Kant’s critical project, and\nplaced our response to Wittgenstein within that history of thinking. In these and\nother ways, the question of technology as use and technique (and its relation to\nlanguage) turns out to be a fundamental philosophical question that is not only\nowned by a specialized subdiscipline, but that is central to philosophy as such.\nAcknowledgements Open access funding provided by University of Vienna.\nOpen Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0\nInternational License ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, dis-\ntribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original\nauthor(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were\nmade.\nReferences\nAugustine.
