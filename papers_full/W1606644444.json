    "abstract": "Space-mapping optimization techniques allow to allign low-fidelity and high-fidelity models in order to reduce the computational time and increase the accuracy of the solution. The main idea is to build an approximate model from the difference of response between both models. Therefore the optimization process is computed on the surrogate model. In this paper, some recent approaches of space-mapping techniques such as agressive-space-mapping, output-mapping and manifold-mapping algorithms are applied to optimize a safety insulating transformer. The electric, magnetic and thermal phenomena of the device are modeled by an analytical model and a 3D finite element model. It is considered as a benchmark for multi-level optimization to test different algorithms.",
