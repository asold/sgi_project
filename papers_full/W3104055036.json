How to\n∗Qingyu Tan is under the Joint PhD Program between\nAlibaba and National University of Singapore.\nadapt PrLMs to new domains is important. Unlike\nthe most recent work that ﬁne-tunes PrLMs on the\nunlabeled data from the new domains (Han and\nEisenstein, 2019; Gururangan et al., 2020), we are\ninterested in how to adapt the PrLM features with-\nout ﬁne-tuning. To investigate this, we speciﬁcally\nstudy unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) of\nPrLMs, in which we adapt the models trained with\nsource labeled data to the unlabeled target domain\nbased on the features from PrLMs.\nSelf-training has been proven to be effective in\nUDA (Saito et al., 2017), which uses the model\ntrained with source labeled data to predict pseudo\nlabels on the unlabeled target set for model training.\nUnlike the methods of adversarial learning (Ganin\net al., 2016; Chen et al., 2018) and Maximum Mean\nDiscrepancy (MMD) (Gretton et al., 2012) that\nlearn domain-invariant features for domain align-\nment, self-training aims to learn discriminative fea-\ntures over the target domain, since simply matching\ndomain distributions cannot make accurate predic-\ntions on the target after adaptation (Lee et al., 2019;\nSaito et al., 2017). To learn discriminative features\nfor the target, self-training needs to retain a model’s\nhigh-conﬁdence predictions on the target domain\nwhich are considered correct for training. Meth-\nods like ensemble learning (Zou et al., 2019; Ge\net al., 2020; Saito et al., 2017) which adopt mul-\ntiple models to jointly make decisions on pseudo-\nlabel selections have been introduced to achieve\nthis goal. Though these methods can substantially\nreduce wrong predictions on the target, there will\nstill be noisy labels in the pseudo-label set, with\nnegative effects on training a robust model, since\ndeep neural networks with their high capacity can\neasily ﬁt to corrupted labels (Arpit et al., 2017).\nIn our work, to improve the robustness of self-\ntraining, we propose to jointly learn discrimina-\ntive features from the PrLM on the target do-\nmain to alleviate the negative effects caused by\n7387\nnoisy labels. We introduce class-aware feature self-\ndistillation (CFd) to achieve this goal (§4.2). The\nfeatures from PrLMs have been proven to be highly\ndiscriminative for downstream tasks, so we propose\nto distill this kind of features to a feature adaptation\nmodule (FAM) to make FAM capable of extract-\ning discriminative features ( §4.2.1). Inspired by\nrecent work on representation learning (van den\nOord et al., 2018; Hjelm et al., 2019), we introduce\nmutual information (MI) maximization for feature\nself-distillation (Fd). We maximize the MI between\nthe features from the PrLM and the FAM to make\nthe two kinds of features more dependent. Since Fd\ncan only distill features from the PrLM, it ignores\nthe cluster information of data points which can\nalso improve feature discriminativeness (Chapelle\nand Zien, 2005; Lee et al., 2019). Hence, for the\nfeatures output by FAM, if the corresponding data\npoints belong to the same class, we further mini-\nmize their feature distance to make the cluster more\ncohesive, so that different classes will be more sep-\narable. To retain high-conﬁdence predictions, we\nre-rank the predicted candidates and balance the\nnumbers of samples in different classes (§4.1).\nWe use XLM-R (Conneau et al., 2019) as the\nPrLM which is trained on over 100 languages. We\nalso extend our method to cross-language, as well\nas cross-language and cross-domain settings us-\ning XLM-R, since it has already mapped different\nlanguages into a common feature space. We experi-\nment with two monolingual and multilingual Ama-\nzon review datasets for sentiment classiﬁcation:\nMonoAmazon for cross-domain and MultiAmazon\nfor cross-language experiments. We demonstrate\nthat self-training can be consistently improved by\nCFd in all settings (§5.3). Further empirical results\nindicate that the improvements come from learning\nlower errors of ideal joint hypothesis (§4.3,5.4).\n2 Related Work\nAdaptation of PrLMs. Recently, signiﬁcant im-\nprovements on multiple NLP tasks have been en-\nabled by pre-trained language models (PrLMs) (De-\nvlin et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019c;\nHoward and Ruder, 2018; Peters et al., 2018). To\nenhance their performance on new domains, much\nwork has been done to adapt PrLMs. Two main\nadaptation settings have been studied. The ﬁrst\nis the same as what we study in this work: the\nPrLM provides the features based on which do-\nmain adaptation is conducted (Han and Eisenstein,\n2019; Cao et al., 2019; Logeswaran et al., 2019; Ma\net al., 2019; Li et al., 2020). In the second setting,\nthe corpus for pre-training a language model has\nlarge domain discrepancy with the target domain,\nso in this scenario, we need the target unlabeled\ndata to ﬁne-tune the PrLM after which we train\na task-speciﬁc model (Gururangan et al., 2020).\nFor example, Lee et al. (2020) and Alsentzer et al.\n(2019) transfer PrLMs into biomedical and clinical\ndomains. Instead of ﬁne-tuning PrLMs with unla-\nbeled data from the new domain as in most previ-\nous work (Rietzler et al., 2019; Han and Eisenstein,\n2019; Gururangan et al., 2020), we are interested\nin the feature-based approach (Devlin et al., 2019;\nPeters et al., 2019) to adapt PrLMs, which does not\nﬁne-tune PrLMs. The feature-based approach is\nmuch faster, easier, and more memory-efﬁcient for\ntraining than the ﬁne-tuning-based method, since\nit does not have to update the parameters of the\nPrLMs which are usually massive especially the\nnewly released GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020).\nDomain Adaptation. To perform domain adap-\ntation, previous work mainly focuses on how to\nminimize the domain discrepancy and how to learn\ndiscriminative features on the target domain (Ben-\nDavid et al., 2010). Kernelized methods, e.g.,\nMMD (Gretton et al., 2012; Long et al., 2015),\nand adversarial learning (Ganin et al., 2016; Chen\net al., 2018) are commonly used to learn domain-\ninvariant features. To learn discriminative features\nfor DA, self-training is widely explored (Saito et al.,\n2017; Ge et al., 2020; Zou et al., 2019, 2018; He\net al., 2018). To retain high-conﬁdence predictions\nfor self-training, ensemble methods like tri-training\n(Saito et al., 2017), mutual learning (Ge et al., 2020)\nand dual information maximization (Ye et al., 2019)\nhave been introduced. However, the pseudo-label\nset will still have noisy labels which will nega-\ntively affect model training (Arpit et al., 2017;\nZhang et al., 2017). Other methods on learning\ndiscriminative features include feature reconstruc-\ntion (Ghifary et al., 2016), semi-supervised learn-\ning (Laine and Aila, 2017), and virtual adversar-\nial training (Lee et al., 2019). Based on cluster\nassumption (Chapelle and Zien, 2005) and the re-\nlationship between decision boundary and feature\nrepresentations, Lee et al. (2019) explore class in-\nformation to learn discriminative features. Class\ninformation is also studied in distant supervision\nlearning for relation extraction (Ye et al., 2017).\nIn NLP, early work explores domain-invariant and\n7388\n𝑥Embedding layer 0Transformer\nTransformer\nTransformerTransformer𝑓𝑓\n𝑓\n𝐴𝑡𝑡\n\"ℎ!\n𝑧! 𝑧𝑐𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑒𝑟\n𝐿𝑎𝑠𝑡𝑁𝑙𝑎𝑦𝑒𝑟𝑠\n𝐹𝐴𝑀𝑃𝑟𝐿𝑀\nFigure 1: Illustration of our model architecture which\nincludes a pre-trained language model, a feature adap-\ntation module, and a classiﬁer.\ndomain-speciﬁc words to reduce domain discrep-\nancy (Blitzer et al., 2007; Pan et al., 2010; He et al.,\n2011).\n3 Preliminary\nIn this section, we introduce the problem deﬁnition\nand the model architecture based on which we build\nour domain adaptation algorithm presented in the\nnext section.\n3.1 Unsupervised Domain Adaptation\nIn order to improve the feature adaptability of pre-\ntrained transformers cross domains, we study unsu-\npervised domain adaptation of pre-trained language\nmodels where we train models with labeled data\nand unlabeled data from the source and target do-\nmain respectively. We use the features from PrLMs\nto perform domain adaptation. Labeled data from\nthe source domain are deﬁned as S = {Xs,Ys}, in\nwhich every sample xs ∈Xs has a label ys ∈Ys.\nThe unlabeled data from the target domain are\nT = {Xt}. In this work, we comprehensively\nstudy domain adaptation in cross-domain and cross-\nlanguage settings, based on the features from the\nmulti-lingual PrLM where we adopt XLM-R (Con-\nneau et al., 2019) for evaluation. By using XLM-R,\ndifferent languages can be mapped into a common\nfeature space. In this work, we evaluate our method\non the task of sentiment classiﬁcation using two\ndatasets.\n3.2 Model Architecture\nAs presented in Figure 1, our model consists of\na pre-trained language model (PrLM), a feature\nadaptation module (FAM), and a classiﬁer.\n3.2.1 Pre-trained Language Model\nFollowing BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), most PrLMs\nconsist of an embedding layer and several trans-\nformer layers. Suppose a PrLM has L+ 1 lay-\ners, layer 0 is the embedding layer, and layer\nL is the last layer. Given an input sentence\nx = [ w1,w2,··· ,w|x|], the embedding layer of\nthe PrLM will encode x as:\nh0 = Embedding(x) (1)\nwhere h0 = [ h1\n0,h2\n0,··· ,h|x|\n0 ]. After obtaining\nthe embeddings of the input sentence, we compute\nthe features of the sentence from the transformer\nblocks of PrLM. In layer l, we compute the trans-\nformer feature as:\nhl = Transformerl(hl−1) (2)\nwhere hl = [ h1\nl,h2\nl,··· ,h|x|\nl ] and l ∈ {1,2,\n··· ,L}. Using all the |x|features will incur much\nmemory space. After experiments, we take the\naverage of hl as:\n¯hl = 1\n|x|\n|x|∑\ni=1\nhi\nl (3)\nand ¯hl will be fed into the FAM.\n3.2.2 Feature Adaptation Module\nTo transfer the knowledge from the source to the\ntarget domain, the features from PrLMs should be\nmore transferable. Previous work points out that\nthe PrLM features from the intermediate layers are\nmore transferable than the upper-layer features, and\nthe upper-layer features are more discriminative for\nclassiﬁcation (Hao et al., 2019; Peters et al., 2018;\nLiu et al., 2019b). By making a trade-off between\nspeed and model performance, we combine the last\nN-layer features from the PrLM for domain adapta-\ntion, which is called the multi-layer representation\nof the PrLM.\nOur FAM consists of a feed-forward neural net-\nwork (followed by a tanh activation function) and\nan attention mechanism. We map ¯hl from layer l\ninto zl with the feed-forward neural network:\nzl = f(¯hl) (4)\nMulti-layer Representation. Since feature effec-\ntiveness differs from layer to layer, we use an at-\ntention mechanism (Luong et al., 2015) to learn to\nweight the features from the last N layers. We get\n7389\nthe multi-layer representation z of the PrLM as:\nz = E(x; θ) =\nL∑\ni=L−N+1\nαizi\nαi = etanh(Wattzi)\n∑L\nj=L−N+1 etanh(Wattzj)\n(5)\nin which Watt is a matrix of trainable parameters.\nInspired by Berthelot et al. (2019), we want the\nmodel to focus more on the higher-weighted layers,\nso we further calculate the attention weight as:\nαi = α1/τ\ni\n∑L\nj=L−N+1 α1/τ\nj\n(6)\nwhere θ is a set of learnable parameters that in-\ncludes the parameters from the feed-forward neural\nnetwork and the attention mechanism.\n3.2.3 Classiﬁer\nAfter obtaining the multi-layer representationz, we\ntrain a classiﬁer with the source domain labeled set\nS. We deﬁne the loss function for the task-speciﬁc\nclassiﬁer as:\nLS\npred = 1\n|S|\n∑\n⟨x,y⟩∈S\nl\n(\ng(E(x; θ); φ),y\n)\n(7)\nwhere gis a classiﬁer that takes in the features out\nof E, and g is parameterized by φ. l is the loss\nfunction which is cross-entropy loss in our work.\n4 Class-aware Feature Self-distillation\nfor Domain Adaptation\nIn this section, we introduce our method for domain\nadaptation. Our domain adaptation loss function\ntakes the form of:\nL= LS\npred + LT′\npred + LCFd (8)\nin which LS\npred is for learning a task-speciﬁc clas-\nsiﬁer with the source labeled set S(Eq. 7), LT′\npred\nis the self-training loss trained with the pseudo-\nlabel set T′ (§4.1), and LCFd is to enhance the\nrobustness of self-training by learning discrimina-\ntive features from the PrLM ( §4.2), which is the\nmain algorithm for domain adaptation in this work.\n4.1 Self-training for Adaptation\nWe build our adaptation model based on self-\ntraining, which predicts pseudo labels on unlabeled\ntarget data. The predicted pseudo labels will be\nused for model training. In the training process, we\npredict pseudo labels on all the target samples in T.\nTo retain high-conﬁdence predictions from T, we\n𝑥Embedding layer\nTransformer\nTransformerTransformer\nFAM\n\"ℎ!\nAve\n\"ℎ!\n̅𝑥 𝑧𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑙𝑙\n𝐿𝑎𝑠𝑡𝑁𝑙𝑎𝑦𝑒𝑟𝑠\nFigure 2: Illustration of feature self-distillation. We\ntake the sum of the lastN-layer features for distillation.\nintroduce a simple but effective method calledrank-\ndiversify to build the pseudo-label set T′, which is\na subset of T:\nRank. We calculate the entropy loss for every\nsample in T, speciﬁcally:\ng(z) = Softmax\n(\ng(z)\n)\nLe(z) = −\n∑\ng(z)T log g(z)\n(9)\nin which z is the multi-layer feature and g is the\nclassiﬁer in Eq. 7. A lower entropy loss indicates\na higher conﬁdence of the model for the pseudo\nlabel. Then we use the entropy loss to re-rank\nT. However, after re-ranking, some classes may\nhave too many samples in the top K candidates,\nwhich will bias model training, so we also need to\ndiversify the pseudo labels in the top Klist.\nDiversify. We classify the samples into differ-\nent classes with pseudo labels, and re-rank them\nwith entropy loss in ascending order in every class.\nSamples are selected following the order from ev-\nery class in turn until Ksamples are selected.\nWith the retained pseudo-label set T′, we have\nthe loss function for training as:\nLT′\npred = α 1\n|T′|\n∑\n⟨x,y⟩∈T′\nl\n(\ng(E(x; θ); φ),y\n)\n(10)\nin which αis a hyper-parameter which will increase\ngradually in the training process.\n4.2 Robust Self-training by Discriminative\nFeature Learning\nTo alleviate the negative effects caused by the noisy\nlabels in the pseudo-label set T′, we propose to\nlearn discriminative features from the PrLM.\n4.2.1 Feature Self-distillation\nTo maintain the discriminative power of PrLM\nfeatures, we propose to self-distill the PrLM fea-\ntures into the newly added feature adaptation mod-\nule (FAM). Similar to traditional knowledge distil-\n7390\nlation (Hinton et al., 2015), feature distillation in\nour work is to make the FAM (student) also capable\nof generating discriminative features for adaptation\nas the PrLM (teacher) does. Since the source do-\nmain already has the labeled data, there is no need\nfor self-distillation on the source domain, and we\napply feature self-distillation (Fd) to the target do-\nmain. Inspired by recent work on representation\nlearning (van den Oord et al., 2018; Hjelm et al.,\n2019; Tian et al., 2020), we propose to use mutual\ninformation (MI) maximization for Fd.\nMI for Feature Self-distillation. MI measures\nhow different two random variables are. Maximiz-\ning the MI between them can reduce their differ-\nence. By maximizing the MI between the features\nfrom PrLM and FAM, we can make the two fea-\ntures more similar. We are interested in distilling\nthe PrLM features into the multi-layer represen-\ntation z. We can distill the feature ¯hl from any\nlayer linto z. However, only distilling one-layer\nfeature of the PrLM may neglect the information\nfrom other layers, so we use the sum of the last\nN-layer features for distillation1:\n¯x =\nL∑\ni=L−N+1\n¯hi (11)\nThe distillation process is illustrated in Figure 2.\nThen we maximize the MI I(z,¯x). We need to ﬁnd\nits lower bound for maximization, since it is hard\nto directly estimate mutual information. Follow-\ning van den Oord et al. (2018), we also use Noise\nContrastive Estimation (NCE) to infer the lower\nbound as:\nI(z,¯x) ≥Jfeat\nNCE(z,¯x) (12)\nTo estimate the NCE loss, we need a negative sam-\nple set in which the PrLM features are randomly\nsampled for the current z. Given a negative sample\nset ¯Xneg = {¯xneg\ni }|¯Xneg|\ni=1 , we estimate Jfeat\nNCE as:\nJfeat\nNCE = f(z,¯x) − 1\n|¯Xneg|\n∑\n¯xneg\ni ∈¯Xneg\nf(z,¯xneg\ni )\n(13)\nf(z,¯x∗) is the similarity function, deﬁned as:\nf(z,¯x∗) = cos\n(\ninf(z),¯x∗)\n(14)\nwhere ¯x∗∈{¯x}∪ ¯Xneg; inf(·) is a trainable feed-\nforward neural network followed by the tanh ac-\ntivation, which is to resize the dimension of z to\nbe equal to ¯x∗. To obtain the negative sample set,\n1Based on Eq.14, taking the sum or average of the last\nN-layer features will have the same effect.\nwe select one negative ¯x by randomly shufﬂing the\nbatch of features which the negative ¯x is in, and\nthis process is repeated |¯Xneg|times.\n4.2.2 Class Information\nFeature distillation can only maintain the discrimi-\nnative power of PrLM features but ignores the class\ninformation present in class labels. To explore the\nclass information, when performing feature self-\ndistillation, we further introduce an intra-class loss\nto minimize the feature distance under the same\nclass. By giving the pseudo-label set T′and the\nsource labeled set S, we group the multi-layer fea-\ntures out of the FAM into different classes. For\nevery class c, we calculate the center feature as zc.\nWe deﬁne the intra-class loss as follows:\nLintra class =\n∑\nc∈C\n∑\nzi∈Sc∪T′c\n∥zi −zc∥2 (15)\nwhere Cis the set of classes. The center feature zc\nfor class c∈Cis calculated as:\nzc = 1\n|Sc ∪T′c|\n∑\nzj∈Sc∪T′c\nzj (16)\nBefore training for an epoch, the center features\nwill be calculated and ﬁxed during training. After\none epoch of training, the center features will be\nupdated. After the above analysis, our ﬁnal CFd\nloss becomes:\nLCFd = LT\nFd + LS,T′\nC = −\n∑\nx∈T\nJfeat\nNCE\n(\nE(x; θ),¯x\n)\n+ λ\n∑\n⟨x,y⟩∈S∪T′\nLintra class\n(17)\nwhere λis a hyper-parameter which controls the\ncontribution of LS,T′\nC .\n4.3 Analysis\nWe provide a theoretical understanding for why\nCFd can enhance self-training based on the domain\nadaptation theory from Ben-David et al. (2010).\nTheorem 1. (Ben-David et al., 2010) Let Hbe the\nhypothesis space.

Self-\ntraining aims to learn a low joint error by learning\ndiscriminative features on the target domain, so that\nthe adaptation performance can be improved (Saito\net al., 2017). Our proposed CFd enhances the ro-\nbustness of self-training by self-distilling the PrLM\nfeatures and exploring the class information. In\nthis way, the joint error can be further reduced\ncompared to self-training (Fig. 3). Besides, by op-\ntimizing the intra-class loss, dH∆Hin Ineq. 18 can\nbe reduced since under the same class, the feature\ndistance of samples from both the source and target\ndomain is minimized (Fig. 4).\n5 Experiments\n5.1 Datasets\nWe use two Amazon review datasets for evaluation.\nOne is monolingual and the other is multilingual.\nMonoAmazon. This dataset consists of English re-\nviews from He et al. (2018) and has four domains:\nBook (BK), Electronics (E), Beauty (BT), and Mu-\nsic (M). Each domain has 2,000 positive, 2,000\nnegative, and 2,000 neutral reviews.\nMultiAmazon. This is a multilingual review\ndataset (Prettenhofer and Stein, 2010) in English,\nGerman, French, and Japanese. For every language,\nthere are three domains: Book, Dvd, and Music.\nEach domain has 2,000 reviews for training and\n2,000 for test, with 1,000 positive and 1,000 nega-\ntive reviews in each set. 6,000 additional reviews\nform the unlabeled set for each domain. The source\ndomains are only selected from the English corpus.\nTable 2 shows the data split. To construct the\nunlabeled set for the target domain, we use reviews\nfrom the test set as the unlabeled data in MonoAma-\nzon following He et al. (2018). For MultiAmazon,\nreviews from the training set and original unlabeled\nset both from the target domain are combined.\nWe also evaluate our model on the benchmark\ndataset of (Blitzer et al., 2007). The results are\npresented in Appendix B.\n5.2 Experimental Setup\nModel Settings. To enable cross-language trans-\nfer, we use XLM-R2 (Conneau et al., 2019) which\nhas 25 layers as the pre-trained language model.\nThe dimension of its token embeddings is 1024\nwhich is mapped into 256 by the FAM. Based on\none transfer result, the last 10-layer features are\nused in FAM. λfor intra-class loss is set as 1 and 2\nfor MonoAmazon and MultiAmazon respectively.\nWe set the size of negative sample set as 10 and we\nperform Fd training only in the target domain.τfor\nattention mechanism in Eq. 6 is set as 0.3. In the\ntraining process, we gradually increase the num-\nber of retained pseudo labels for self-training, in\nwhich we increase the number by 100 for MonoA-\nmazon and 300 for MultiAmazon every epoch. α\nfor LT′\npred is the linear and quadratic function of\nepoch for MonoAmazon and MultiAmazon respec-\ntively.

More detailed transfer results are included in Appendix D.\nBaselines. Since we are interested in adapting fea-\ntures of PrLMs without tuning, we mainly set up\nthe baselines that use the features from XLM-R\nby freezing XLM-R. Trained on the source do-\nmain, xlmr-1 directly tests on the target without\ndomain adaptation and it only uses the last-layer\nfeatures of XLM-R. xlmr-10 is the same as xlmr-1,\nexcept that it uses the multi-layer representation of\nXLM-R with last 10-layer features. KL (Zhuang\net al., 2015) uses the balanced Kullback-Leibler\ndivergence loss to decrease the domain discrep-\nancy for domain adaptation. MMD adopts the\nMaximum Mean Discrepancy loss (Gretton et al.,\n2012) in which Gaussian Kernel is implemented.\nAdv (Ganin et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2018) adver-\nsarially trains a domain classiﬁer to learn domain-\ninvariant features by reversing the gradients from\nthe domain classiﬁer following Ganin et al. (2016).\np is our self-training method introduced in §4.1.\np+CFd is our full model that uses CFd to enhance\nthe robustness of self-training. DAS (He et al.,\n2018) uses semi-supervised learning. CLDFA (Xu\nand Yang, 2017) is a cross-lingual baseline which\nuses cross-lingual resources. MAN-MoE (Chen\net al., 2019) studies multi-lingual transfer which\nhas multiple languages in the source domain. MoE\nlearns to focus on more transferable source do-\nmains for adaptation. xlmr-10, KL, MMD, Adv,\np, and p+CFd are all based on the multi-layer rep-\nresentations with last 10-layer features. For KL,\nMMD, and Adv, to minimize domain discrepancy,\nwe use an unlabeled set of the same size in the\nsource domain as the target domain.\nxlmr-tuning3 ﬁrst ﬁne-tunes XLM-R with\nsource labeled data using the representation from\nthe ﬁnal layer [CLS] and being fed to the classi-\nﬁer (Devlin et al., 2019), then tests on the target.\nBy setting up this baseline, we want to see how\nwell the feature-based approach works.\nMore detailed baseline settings can be found in\nAppendix A.3.\n5.3 Main Results\nWe conduct experiments in cross-domain (CD),\ncross-language (CL), and both cross-language and\ncross-domain (CLCD) settings. Results of CD are\nevaluated on MonoAmazon (Table 1) and results\nof CL and CLCD are on MultiAmazon (Table 3).\nFor CL, English is set as the source language. The\ndomains in the source and target languages are\nthe same, i.e., When German&book is the target,\nthe source will be English&book. For CLCD, the\nsources are also only from English. For example,\nwhen the target is German&book, the source lan-\nguage is English and the source domain is dvd\nor music, in which two sources are set up: En-\nglish&dvd and English&music, and the two adap-\ntation results are averaged for German&book.\n3Because of the limited computing resources, we cannot\nﬁne-tune XLM-R with unlabeled target data using LM loss.\n7393\nMETHOD E→BK BT→BK M→BK BK→E BT→E M→E BK→BT E→BT M→BT BK→M E→M BT→M Ave.\nxlmr-10 70.41 67.80 70.83 56.47 70.65 64.74 61.30 71.57 65.38 63.33 67.69 64.47 65.16\np 70.90 71.38 72.18 64.00 70.41 67.01 67.48 71.67 70.71 67.16 67.92 69.77 69.21\np+CFd 75.25 74.70 75.08 70.19 72.00 68.96 71.63 73.73 70.05 70.86 69.80 70.46 71.89\np+C (w/o Fd) 73.16 73.59 74.80 68.72 71.11 68.15 69.80 74.02 71.03 66.78 69.22 68.93 70.78\np+Fd (w/o C) 71.61 71.10 72.39 67.14 71.23 67.38 69.41 73.04 70.80 68.84 68.14 68.97 70.00\nCFd (w/o p) 70.08 72.37 71.30 66.72 70.57 64.21 68.32 72.38 69.27 68.23 66.12 68.37 69.00\nFd (w/o p+C) 68.16 69.55 70.18 66.59 71.02 63.92 69.18 72.10 67.77 69.73 65.71 66.13 68.34\nTable 4: The classiﬁcation accuracy (%) results of p+CFd and its ablations on MonoAmazon.\nWe have the following ﬁndings from Table 1 and\n3 based on the overall average scores. xlmr-10\nvs. xlmr-tuning: xlmr-10 is slightly better than\nxlmr-tuning which demonstrates the effectiveness\nof the feature-based approach. xlmr-1 vs. xlmr-10:\nxlmr-10 is much better than xlmr-1 which means\nour multi-layer representation of XLM-R is much\nmore transferable than the last-layer feature. xlmr-\n10 vs. p: p is consistently better than xlmr-10\nwhich shows our self-training method is effective.\np vs. p+CFd: After using CFd, p can be con-\nsistently improved and p+CFd achieves the best\nperformance among all the methods, which shows\nthe effectiveness of CFd.\n5.4 Further Analysis\nAblation Study. We conduct the ablation exper-\niments to see the contributions of feature self-\ndistillation (Fd) and class information (C), which\nare evaluated on MonoAmazon based on last 10-\nlayer features. By ablating p+CFd, we have four\nbaselines of p+C (w/o Fd), p+Fd (w/o C), CFd (w/o\np) and Fd (w/o p+C). From the results in Table 4,\np+Fd and p+C perform worse than p+CFd but still\nbetter than p, so feature self-distillation and class\ninformation both contribute to the improvements\nof p. Also, by removing the effects of p, CFd and\nFd substantially outperform xlmr-10, which means\nCFd and Fd are both effective for domain adapta-\ntion, independent of the self-training method.\nJoint errors. Here we study why CFd can en-\nhance self-training and provide empirical results to\ndemonstrate the theoretical understanding in §4.3.\nBy testing on MonoAmazon based on last 10-layer\nfeatures, Figure 3 presents the joint error results.\nFor example, to ﬁnd h∗in Eq. 20 for baseline p,\nfollowing Liu et al. (2019a), we train a classiﬁer\nusing the combined source and target labeled data\nbased on the ﬁxed FAM trained by p. We note that\np+Fd and p+C can achieve lower joint errors com-\npared to p, and p+CFd has the best performance,\nwhich is consistent with our analysis in §4.3.\nBK->M BK->BT BK->E\n48\n50\n52\n54\n56\n58\n60Joint error (%)\np\np+Fd\np+C\np+CFd\nFigure 3: The errors of ideal joint hypothesis tested on\nMonoAmazon.\nMETHODM→BKBK→EM→EBK→BTM→BTBK→M Ave.\nSuper 77.54 74.56 74.08 75.66 75.48 72.88 75.03\nFd 76.34 72.44 72.44 74.35 73.15 74.12 73.81\nTable 5: The classiﬁcation accuracy (%) results of in-\ndomain test evaluated on MonoAmazon.\nEffects of Feature Self-distillation. We conduct\nan in-domain test to verify that Fd learns discrim-\ninative features from the PrLM. We build a sen-\ntiment classiﬁcation model with in-domain data\nbased on the last 10-layer features. From the same\ndomain in MonoAmazon, we select 4,000 labeled\npairs for training, 1,000 for validation, and 1,000\nfor test. We ﬁrst pre-train the FAM by Fd using\nthe entire 6,000 raw texts, then we freeze FAM\nand train a classiﬁer with the training data with\nfeatures out of FAM. We compare the results with\nthe baseline that directly trains the FAM and classi-\nﬁer with training set (Super). From the results in\nTable 5, the performances of Fd are very close to\nSuper, showing that the features out of FAM after\nFd training are discriminative.\nEffects of Class Information. Table 6 presents\nthe average intra-class loss in the training process.\nBy exploring class information, the intra-class loss\ncan be dramatically minimized and accordingly the\ntransfer performances are improved.\nA-distance.

From Figure 4, p+C and p+CFd\nhave much smaller A-distance, which means that\nthe intra-class loss reduces the domain discrepancy.\np+Fd has larger A-distance, probably because Fd\nlearns domain-speciﬁc information from the target\nso the domain distance becomes larger.\nEffects of Attention Mechanism. We further\nshow whether combining the intermediate-layer\nfeatures can enhance adaptation. In Table 7, one\nlayer means only using one-layer features for trans-\nfer and the results are obtained by using the fea-\nture from the most transferable layer. We intro-\nduce the attention mechanism to combine the last\nN-layer features. We demonstrate that using last\n10-layer features with attention can achieve better\nperformances. A VE that averages the lastN-layer\nfeatures cannot improve the performance, since it\nlacks the ability to focus more on effective features.\nWe also study how the size of negative sample\nset affects feature distillation and the effects of\nsharpen on attention mechanism. The analysis is\nincluded in Appendix C.\n6 Conclusion\nIn this paper, we study how to adapt the features\nfrom the pre-trained language models without tun-\ning. We speciﬁcally study unsupervised domain\nadaptation of PrLMs, where we transfer the models\ntrained in labeled source domain to the unlabeled\ntarget domain based on PrLM features. We build\nour adaptation method based on self-training. To\nenhance the robustness of self-training, we present\nthe method of class-aware feature self-distillation\nto learn discriminative features. Experiments on\nsentiment analysis in cross-language and cross-\ndomain settings demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour method.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by Alibaba Group\nthrough the Alibaba Innovative Research (AIR)\nProgram.\nReferences\nEmily Alsentzer, John R.

(2018) which\ncan be downloaded online 4. Then we follow He\net al. (2018) to pre-process the datasets which only\ninvolves splitting the data into training, validation,\nand test sets.\nA.2 Model Conﬁguration\nFor MonoAmazon, the learning rate is 0.0001, and\nthe batch size is 50 for classiﬁer training and MI\nlearning. We run 35 times for each baseline except\nxlmr-1 and xlmr-10 which are run 20 times and\nthe batch size is 100. In epoch 0, we set to retain\nthe top 950 high-conﬁdence predictions for self-\ntraining and we increase the number of retained\ndata by 100 every epoch. λfor Fd training is 1.\nFor MultiAmazon and Benchmark, the learning\nrate is 0.0005. The batch size for classiﬁer learn-\ning is 50 and for MI training is 200. The training\nepoch is 20. λfor MultiAmazon and Benchmark\nis 2. In epoch 0, we set to retain the top 1000\nhigh-conﬁdence predictions for self-training. We\nincrease by 150 retained samples every epoch for\nBenchmark, and by 300 for MultiAmazon.\nαfor LT′\npred is the linear function of epoch for\nMonoAmazon, and the quadratic function for Mul-\ntiAmazon and Benchmark. Adam (Kingma and Ba,\n2015) is used for model training. In the training\nprocess, if the validation performance does not im-\nprove after 10 consecutive epochs, the learning rate\nwill be halved.\nFor all the datasets, the size of negative sample\nset is set as 10. τ for attention mechanism is set as\n0.3, tuned from {0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0}.\n4https://github.com/ruidan/DAS\n7397\nparameter MonoAmazon MultiAmazon Benchmark\nlearning rate 0.0001 0.0005 0.0005\nλ 1 2 2\nα linear function of epoch quadratic function of epoch quadratic function of epoch\nMax epoch 35 20 20\nSize of negative sample set 10 10 10\nTable 8: Hyper-parameter settings for main experiments.\nDATA train (S) valid (S) test (T) unlabeled (T) |C|\nBenchmark 1,600 400 400 6,000 2\nTable 9: The data split for training, validation, test,\nand unlabeled set on Benchmark. |C|is the number\nof classes.\nA.3 Settings for Baselines\nKL. The KL-divergence loss (Zhuang et al., 2015)\nis deﬁned as:\nKL = DKL(ξs||ξt) + DKL(ξt||ξs) (21)\nwhere\nξ′\ns = 1\nn\nn∑\ni=1\nzi\ns ξs = softmax(ξ′\ns)\nξ′\nt = 1\nn\nn∑\ni=1\nzi\nt ξt = softmax(ξ′\nt)\n(22)\nin which n is the batch size. We set the weight\nof KL loss as 500, tuned from {100, 500, 1000,\n5000}.\nMMD. We use the Gaussian kernel to implement\nthe MMD loss (Gretton et al., 2012). The kernel\nnumber is 5. The weight for MMD loss is set to 1,\ntuned from {1, 0.1, 0.5}\nAdv. We follow Ganin et al. (2016) to reverse\nthe gradients from the domain classiﬁer. We set\nthe learning rate for Adv to be the same as the\nbaselines, but set the weight for domain classiﬁer\nas 0.01, tuned from {1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001}.\nxlmr-tuning. The ﬁne-tuning baseline uses the\nﬁrst [CLS] token as the document representation.\nThe learning rate is 1e-5 and the batch size for\ngradient update is 32. The ﬁne-tuning models gen-\nerally overﬁt the training data in 5 epochs.\nB Results on Benchmark\nBenchmark. This is a benchmark dataset for do-\nmain adaptation (Blitzer et al., 2007), whose re-\nviews are also in English. Four domains are in-\ncluded: Book (B), DVDs (D), Electronics (E), and\nKitchen (K). Each domain has 1,000 positive and\n1,000 negative reviews. Following He et al. (2018),\nthere are 4,000 unlabeled reviews for each domain.\nTable 9 summarizes the data split when training on\nBenchmark. The unlabeled set is the combination\nof the training set and the original unlabeled set.\nTable 10 shows the results on Benchmark.\nC Further Analysis\nSize of Negative Sample Set. We study how the\nsize of negative sample set will affect Fd training.\nThe results are shown in Fig. 5. The method used\nis xlmr-10+Fd. We ﬁnd that using a size that is too\nsmall or too big is not a good strategy for Fd learn-\ning. Size of 10 is a good option for Fd learning.\nEffects of Sharpen on Attention Mechanism. In\nFig. 6, we show the effects of sharpen mechanism\nin our attention method which demonstrates that\nwhen not using sharpen (τ is ∞), the performance\nwill drop and τ set as 0.3 is a good option for our\nattention method.\nD Full Results on MultiAmazon\nTable 11 shows the full results on MultiAmazon.\n7398\nBenchmarkD→B K →B E →B B →D K →D E →D B →K D →K E →K B →E D →E K →E Ave.\nAsyTri 73.20 72.50 73.20 80.70 74.90 72.90 82.50 82.50 86.90 79.80 77.00 84.60 78.39\nDAS 82.05 80.05 80.00 82.75 81.40 80.15 82.25 81.50 84.85 81.15 81.55 85.80 81.96\nxlmr-1 88.50 78.45 82.50 85.25 80.55 81.80 84.50 81.15 88.45 81.25 79.35 90.05 83.48\nxlmr-10 91.30 1.0 87.951.0 87.950.3 87.900.5 87.050.6 86.850.4 90.451.0 87.551.5 92.300.7 88.900.5 89.051.7 91.600.3 89.07\nKL 91.500.8 88.950.6 88.050.5 87.200.6 87.850.5 87.300.6 90.001.0 91.150.3 92.700.4 89.700.6 90.650.2 91.351.0 89.70\nMMD 91.75 0.5 88.651.1 87.550.9 87.050.7 86.450.3 86.500.6 90.050.3 90.700.5 92.300.3 90.150.3 91.500.6 91.650.7 89.53\nAdv 91.40 0.8 88.100.4 88.150.4 87.701.0 87.350.8 86.650.3 90.650.5 87.551.5 92.250.2 89.250.5 89.801.3 91.600.6 89.20\np 91.40 0.3 89.500.4 88.200.6 87.400.3 87.150.3 87.050.9 90.000.6 87.551.7 92.600.3 88.850.2 89.651.9 91.850.4 89.27\np+CFd 91.50 0.4 89.750.8 88.650.4 87.650.1 87.800.4 88.200.4 92.450.6 92.450.2 93.600.5 91.300.2 91.550.3 92.600.5 90.63\nTable 10: The cross-domain classiﬁcation accuracy (%) results on Benchmark.
