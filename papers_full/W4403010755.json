  "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT, BART, and Gemini stand at the forefront of Generative Artificial Intelligence, showcasing remarkable prowess in natural language comprehension and task execution. This paper proposes a novel framework developed on the foundation of Llama 2, aiming to bridge the gap between natural language queries and executable code for geospatial analyses within the PyQGIS environment. It empowers non-expert users to leverage GIS technology without requiring deep knowledge of geospatial programming or tools. Through cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including tailored entity recognition and ontology mapping, the framework accurately interprets user intents and translates them into specific GIS operations. Integration of geospatial ontologies enriches semantic comprehension, ensuring precise alignment between user descriptions, geospatial datasets, and geospatial analysis tasks. A code generation module empowered by Llama 2 converts these interpretations into PyQGIS scripts, enabling the execution of geospatial analysis and results visualization. Rigorous testing across a spectrum of geospatial analysis tasks, with incremental complexity, evaluates the framework and the performance of such a system, with LLM at its core. The proposed system demonstrates proficiency in handling various geometries, spatial relationships, and attribute queries, enabling accurate and efficient analysis of spatial datasets. Moreover, it offers robust error-handling mechanisms and supports tasks related to map styling, visualization, and data manipulation. However, it has some limitations, such as occasional struggles with ambiguous attribute names and aliases, which leads to potential inaccuracies in the filtering and retrieval of features. Despite these limitations, the system presents a promising solution for applications integrating LLMs into GIS and offers a flexible and user-friendly approach to geospatial analysis.",
