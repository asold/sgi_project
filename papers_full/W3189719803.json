INTRODUCTION \nhe Hilbert transform is  a fundamental mathematical \nfunction for signal processing systems. It has found wide \napplications in radar system s, signal sideband modulators, \nmeasurement systems, speech processing, signal sampling, and \nmany other s [1-3]. Fractional Hilbert transforms can meet \nspecific requirements for secure single sideband \ncommunications [2] as well as hardware keys [3] since they \nprovide an additional degree of freedom in terms of a variable \nphase shift. In practical applications such as multiplexing and \ndemultiplexing signals, analyzing individual sub -channel \nspectral components, etc., Hilbert transformers are typically \nrealized as a truncated or windowed version of the ideal Hilbert \ntransform impulse response [ 4-6]. Thus, Hilbert transfo rmers \nthat cover a wide range of different bandpass regions are in high \ndemand. While electronic approaches to Hilbert transformers \nare subject to the well-known electronic bandwidth bottleneck \n[7], photonic RF techniques have attracted wide interest due to \ntheir numerous advantages, including optical bandwidths that \ncan reach 10’s of THz, a strong immunity to electromagnetic \ninterference, and low transmission loss. \n                                                        \nM. Tan and D. J. Moss are with the Optical Science s Centre, Swinburne \nUniversity of Technology, Hawthorn, VIC 3122, Australia. (Corresponding e -\nmail: dmoss@swin.edu.au).  \nA significant amount of research has been devoted to \ndeveloping and extending the capability of photonic RF Hilbert \ntransformers, including the use of  free-space optics [3], \nalthough many approaches suffer from a tradeoff between \nperformance and system complexity. Photonic approaches for \nboth standard and fractional Hilbert transform s offer broad \noperational bandwidths, through the use of novel approaches \nsuch as fibre Bragg gratings [ 8-14], macroing  / microdisk \nresonators [15, 16], and integrated reconfigurable microwave \nprocessors [17]. However, most of these approaches focus only \non generating the Hilbert transform of the complex optical field, \nand not t he actual RF signal . To implement highly \nreconfigurable RF photonic  Hilbert transformers, transversal \nschemes have been investigated. Fractional Hilbert \ntransformers based on transver sal structures have been \ndemonstrated [18, 19] that  offer high reconfigurability . \nHowever, methods that employ multiple discrete laser sources \npresent limitations in the overall system footprint, processing \nperformance, and the potential for full monolithic integration.  \nRecently, [ 20-39] microcombs have attracted significant \ninterest as a fundamentally powerful tool for microwave \nprocessing, due to their ability to offer a large number of \ncoherent wavelengths from one device, thereby increasing the \ncapacity of communications systems [ 40-42], for example. \nFurther, they have enabled the processing of RF spectra for a \nwide range of advanced signal processing functions [43-68] as \nwell as neural networks [69-71]. Previously, [43] we reported a \nHilbert transformer based on a 200 GHz spaced microcomb \ngenerating 20 wavelengths in the C -band that achieved record \nperformance in terms of its RF bandwidth (5 octaves). \nSubsequently, [63] we demonstrated a fractional Hilbert \ntransformer with a performance in RF bandwidth ranging from \n5 to 9 octaves, depending on the fractional order. This was \nbased on a soliton crystal microcomb with an FSR comb \nspacing of 48.9 GHz, with 17 taps selected on a 200GHz grid \nfrom the 75 generated wavelengths across the C-band.72  \nHere, we report a highly reconfigurable and versatile \nfractional Hilbert transformer based on the same soliton crystal \nKerr microcomb source with a 48.9 GHz comb spacing. The \ndevice has the ability to  switch both its bandwidth and center \nfrequency simultaneously and independently. This versatility \ntogether with its high performance is enabled by the use of up \nto 40 of the 75 comb lines generated by the microcomb over C-\nX.

This represents twice the number of wavelengths, or taps, \nused in our previous work [63]. We experimentally demonstrate \na Hilbert transformer with an RF amplitude and phase response \nat bandwidths ranging from 1.2 to 15.3 GHz , together with  \ncentre frequencies varying from baseband to 9 .5 GHz. The \nexperimental results agree well with the theory, confirming the \nfeasibility of our approach towards the realization of high-speed \nreconfigurable Hilbert transformers with reduced footprint, \nlower complexity, and potentially reduced cost.  \nII. PRINCIPAL OF OPERATION \nThe spectral transfer function of a general fractional Hilbert \ntransformer is given by [62, 71]: \n \n𝐻𝑃(𝜔) = { 𝑒−𝑗𝜑 , 𝑖𝑓 0 ≤ 𝜔 < 𝜋\n𝑒𝑗𝜑, 𝑖𝑓 − 𝜋 ≤ 𝜔 < 0  (1) \n \nwhere j = √-1, φ = P × π / 2 denotes the phase shift , P is the \nfractional order (when P = 1, it becomes a standard Hilbert \ntransformer). The corresponding impulse response is given by \na continuous hyperbolic function:  \n \nℎ𝑃 (𝑡) = {\n1\n𝜋𝑡 , 𝑡 ≠ 0\ncot(𝜑) , 𝑡 = 0\n   (2) \n \nThis hyperbolic function is truncated and sampled in time with \ndiscrete taps for digital implementation. The null frequency is \ngiven by: \n \n𝑓𝑐 = 1/∆𝑡    (3) \n \nwhere ∆t denotes the sample spacing. The coefficient of the \ntap at t = 0 can be adjusted to achieve a tunable fractional \norder [3]. The normalized power of each comb line is: \n \n 𝑃𝑛 =\n1\n𝜋|𝑛−𝑁\n2 +0.5|\n    (4) \n \nwhere N is the number of comb lines, or taps, and n = 0, 1, 2, … , \nN-1 is the comb index.  \nIn order to scale the bandwidth of the standard and fractional \nHilbert transformer, we multiplied the corresponding impulse \nresponse of the spectral transfer function of the Hilbert \ntransformer with a cosine function to vary the operation \nbandwidth (designed by the Remez algorithm [73]). Hence, the \nresulting discrete impulse response becomes: \n   \n ℎ𝑇𝐵𝑊𝐻𝑇 (𝑛) = 𝑃𝑛 ∙ cos(2𝜋𝑛 ∙ 𝑓𝐵𝑊)  (5) \n \nwhere fBW is the scalable bandwidth. To further switch the \ncentre frequency of the Hilbert transformer, the tap coefficients \nwere multiplied by a sine function to shift the RF transmission \nspectrum. The corresponding discrete impulse response is given \nby  \n \n ℎ𝑇𝐶𝐹𝐻𝑇 (𝑛) = 𝑃𝑛 ∙ sin(2𝜋𝑛 ∙ 𝑓𝐵𝑊)  (6) \n \nHere, we use this  transversal approach to achieve Hilbert \ntransformers with both variable bandwidths as well as RF centre \nfrequencies. The transfer function of the transversal structure \n[75-85] can be described as: \n \n𝐹(𝜔) = ∑ ℎ(𝑛)𝑒−𝑗𝜔𝑛𝑇𝑀−1\n𝑛−0                           (7) \n \nwhere M is the number of taps, ω is the RF angular frequency, \nT is the time delay between adjacent taps, and h(n) is the tap \ncoefficient of the nth tap.  \nFigure 1 illustrates the schematic diagram of the microcomb-\nbased RF pho tonic Hilbert transformer. The microcomb was \ngenerated by pumping a nonlinear high-Q MRR, fabricated on \na high -index doped silica glass platform , with a CW laser, \namplified with an erbium-doped fibre amplifier (EDFA), with \nthe polarization state aligned to the TE mode of the MRR. When \nthe pump wavelength was swept manually across one of the \nMRR’s resonances and the pump power was high enough to \ngenerate sufficient parametric gain, optical parametric \noscillation occurred, ultimately generating Kerr microcomb  \nwith a spacing equal to the free spectral range of the MRR. The \ngenerated microcomb was then spectrally flattened and \n \nFig. 1. Schematic diagram of fractional Hilbert transformer  based on an \nintegrated Kerr microcomb source.

The weigh ted and delayed \nsignals were summed together upon photodetection and \nconverted back into the RF domain.  \nIII. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS \nThe MRRs used here were fabricated on a platform based on \nHydex glass [ 30, 33, 34, 38, 39] with CMOS compatible \nfabrication processes. First, Hydex films (n = ~1.7 at 1550 nm) \nwere deposited using PECVD, then patterned by deep \nultraviolet (UV) photolithography and etched via reactive ion \netching [ 29] to achieve waveguides with very low surface \nroughness. Finally, an upper cladding layer composed of silica \n(n = ~1.44 at 1550 nm) was deposited. We often employ a \nvertical coupling scheme between the ring resonator  and bus, \nwhere the gap (approximately 200 nm ) can be controlled by \nfilm growth, much more a ccurate than  using lithographic \ntechniques. The advantages of our platform, particularly in \nrelation to optical microcombs,  include ultra -low linear loss \n(~0.06 dB · cm-1), a moderate ly high optical  nonlinear \nparameter (~233 W -1 · km-1), and in particular , a negligible \nnonlinear loss - even up to extremely high intensities of about \n25 GW · cm2. As a result of the ultra-low loss of the platform, \nour MRR features narrow resonance linewidths corresponding \nto Q factors of up to ~1.5 million for the 48.9 GHz MRR. The \ninsertion loss of the through-port was as low as 0.5 to 1 dB/facet \n– a result of very efficient on-chip mode converters that allowed \npackaging the device with fibre pigtails. The radius of the MRR \nwas ~592 µm, corresponding to an optical FSR of 0.393 nm or \n48.9 GHz. Th is small FSR greatly increased the number of \nwavelengths (channels) available over the C band to as many as \n \nFig. 2. Schematic illustration of the integrated MRR for generating the Kerr frequency comb and the optical spectrum of the generated  soliton crystal combs with a \n100-nm span.  \n \nFig. 3. Designed and measured optical spectra for (a)~(e) Tunable bandpass Hilbert transformer with 90 -degree phase shift. (f)~(j) Tunable lowpass Hilbert \ntransformer with 90-degree phase shift. (k)~(o) Tunable bandpass fractional Hilbert transformer with 45 -degree phase shift. Note that all taps are on a ~ 100GHz \ngrid (or 2 x 48.9 = 97.8 GHz) except for the central 3 taps of the fractional transformer (right, (k)~(o)) that a re spaced by 48.9GHz.  \n\n> REPLACE THIS LINE WITH YOUR PAPER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (DOUBLE-CLICK HERE TO EDIT) < \n \n4 \n \n4 \n75 wavelengths to be used for the RF device. This is more than \na factor of two higher than our previous work [63].  \nTo generate microcombs with the 48.9 GHz device, the CW \npump power was amplified to ~30.5 dBm, and the wavelength \nswept from blue to red near one of the TE resonances of the \nMRR at ~1553.2 nm [ 51]. When the d etuning between the \npump wavelength and cold resonance of the MRR became \nsmall enough, such that the intra -cavity power reached a \nthreshold, modulation instability (MI) driven oscillation \noccurred [22]. Primary combs were then generated with the \nspacing determined by the MI gain peak – mainly a function of \nthe dispersion and intra -cavity power. As the detuning was \nchanged further, distinctive ‘fingerprint’ optical spectra \neventually appeared (Fig. 2). The spectra are similar to what has \nbeen reported from spectral interference between tightly packed \nsolitons in the cavity – so-called “soliton crystals” [26-28]. The \nsoliton crystal states provided the lowest RF noise states of all \nour microcombs and have been used as the basis for  an RF \noscillator with low phase-noise [57]. \nThe soliton crystal micr ocomb was first flattened via an \noptical spectral shaper (Finisar, WaveShaper 4000S)  and then \nmodulated with the RF input signal to multicast the RF \nwaveform onto all wavelength channels simultaneously, \nyielding 75 replicas, although only 38 or 39 taps were actually \nused, on a 98 GHz spacing (2 x 48.9 GHz) for the device. These \nwere then passed through ~3.84 km of standard single mode \nfibre (SMF) to provide the progressive time delays  between \nwavelengths. The fibre was approximately twice as long as that \nused in [63] in order to yield comparable RF bandwidths. The \ndispersion of the SMF was ~17.4 ps/nm/km, corresponding to \na time delay ∆t = 26.25 ps between adjacent wavelengths. Next, \nthe se cond WaveShaper  accurately shaped the comb power \naccording to the designed tap coefficients, with the shaped  \ncomb spectrum shown in Fig. 3, for the integral order (90 \ndegree phaseshift) tunable bandpass (a)~(e), integral order (90 \ndegree phaseshift) tunable lowpass (f)~(j), and tunable \nfractional order (45 degree phaseshift) bandpass filter (k)~(o). \nNote that all devices used a ~100GHz tap spacing  (or more \nprecisely 48.9 x 2 = 97.8 GHz), yielding 39 tap lines across the \nC-band. Note the fractional order device us ed an extra single \ntap line at the centre wavelength, yielding 40 wavelengths \noverall, with the centre 3 wavelengths then being spaced at 48.9 \nGHz. The result was that the Nyquist zone for the fractional \ndevice was 24.5 GHz rather than 48.9 GHz for the integral order \ndevices. For standard Hilbert transformer, this extra specific tap \ncoefficient is not  needed and so in principle the full 48.9 GHz \ncomb (75 lines over the C-band) could have been used although \nthese results are not shown here. \nThe wavelength channels for both positive (solid red line) \nand negative (solid gray line) taps were separately measured by \nan optical spectrum analyser (OSA) , achieving good \nperformance that agreed well with the theory (blue dot). Finally, \nthe weighted and del ayed replicas were combined and \nconverted back into the RF domain via a balanced \nphotodetector (Finisar BPDV2150R).  \nThe system RF frequency response was characterized with a \ncalibrated vector network analyser (VNA, Agilent MS4644B) \nto measure the RF transmission and phase response.

The centre \nfrequency of the Hilbert transformer was set into half of the \nFSRRF, which was 19/2 = 9.5 GHz in our case.  \nFigure 5 shows the measured results for the RF amplitude and \nphase response of the lowpass Hilbert transformer , showing  \ntunable bandwidths ranging from 1.2 to 7.1 GHz that match \nclosely with the simulated results. We also perform ed a \ndemonstration of a fractional Hilbert transformer with \nswitchable RF bandwidths ranging from 3.5 to 15.2 GHz. The \nsimulated and measured RF amplitude and phase responses are \nshown in Fig. 6. We achieved a fractional order of 0.5, which \ncorresponds to a 45-degree phase shift , using up to 39 \nwavelengths or taps. This increase of a factor of two from our \nprevious work resulted in a significant reduction in the overall \nroot-mean-square error (RMSE) as well as a modest increase in \nthe potential operational bandwidth, as was predicted [63]. The \nincreased number of taps used here compared with our previous \nwork (3 9 here versus 17 taps in [63]) only resulted in an \nincrease in overall bandwidth of about 0.6 GHz, although the \nperformance in octaves was improved a bit more than this ( 5 \noctaves for 17 taps versus 6.3 octaves achieved here, although \nthe results from [63] are experimental – see Table I). \n \nIV. CONCLUSION \nWe demonstrate a broadband RF photonic Hilbert \ntransformer with variable bandwidths as well as RF  centre \nfrequency, based on a Kerr soliton crystal microcomb. Up to 39 \nwavelengths, or taps were used , resulting in a tu nable \nbandwidth ranging from 1.2 to 15.3 GHz as well as a switchable \ncentre frequency from baseband to 9.5 GHz. Dynamic tuning of \nthe bandwidth, as well as the centre frequency, was achieved by \nprogramming and adjusting the tap weights.  This microcomb \nbased approach represents a solid step towards achieving a fully \nintegrated photonic signal processor for future ultra-high-speed \nRF systems.  \n \nTable.
