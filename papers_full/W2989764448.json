  "abstract": "Large-scale battery cells are connected in series, which inevitably leads to a phenomenon that the cell voltage is unbalanced. With a conventional equalizer, it is challenging to maintain excellent characteristics in terms of its size, design cost, and equalization efficiency. In order to improve the defects in the above equalization circuit, a novel voltage equalization circuit is designed, which can work in two modes. A bidirectional direct current–direct current (DC–DC) equalization structure is adopted, which can quickly equalize two high or low-power batteries without using an external energy buffer. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed circuit, a 12-cell battery 2800-MAh battery string was applied for experimental verification. Computer monitoring (LabVIEW) was adopted in the whole system to intelligently adjust the energy imbalance of the battery pack. The experimental results showed excellent overall performance in terms of equalization was achieved through the newly proposed method. That is, the circuit equalization speed, design cost, and volume have a good balance performance.",
