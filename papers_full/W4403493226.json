    "abstract": "This study explores the application of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to improve the accuracy and reliability of large language models (LLMs) in the context of financial report analysis. The focus is on enabling private investors to make informed decisions by enhancing the question-and-answering capabilities regarding the half-yearly or quarterly financial reports of banks. The study adopts a Design Science Research (DSR) methodology to develop and evaluate an RAG system tailored for this use case. The study conducts a series of experiments to explore models in which different RAG components are used. The aim is to enhance context relevance, answer faithfulness, and answer relevance. The results indicate that model one (OpenAI ADA and OpenAI GPT-4) achieved the highest performance, showing robust accuracy and relevance in response. Model three (MiniLM Embedder and OpenAI GPT-4) scored significantly lower, indicating the importance of high-quality components. The evaluation also revealed that well-structured reports result in better RAG performance than less coherent reports. Qualitative questions received higher scores than the quantitative ones, demonstrating the RAG’s proficiency in handling descriptive data. In conclusion, a tailored RAG can aid investors in providing accurate and contextually relevant information from financial reports, thereby enhancing decision making.",
