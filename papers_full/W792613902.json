  "abstract": "This contribution is devoted to study of dielectric and magnetodielectric properties in transformer oil based magnetic uid.The dielectric permittivity and their anisotropy at various mutual orientation electric (50 Hz) and magnetic eld were shown at the dierent volume concentrations of nanoparticles at room temperature.The linear increase of dielectric constant with volume concentration was conrmed which is in good agreement with the theoretical Maxwell prediction.The dielectric anisotropy factor g(B, ω) is very close to g = 1.The values of permittivity increased with the increase of volume fraction of magnetite nanoparticles.The highest value of anisotropy characterized by deviation of permittivity ∆ε = ε ∥ -ε ⊥ was found for the highest volume concentration which could mean that no aggregation of magnetite nanoparticles had appeared.",
