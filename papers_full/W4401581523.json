    "abstract": "This study addresses the challenges of elaeagnus angustifolia disease detection in smart agriculture by developing a detection system that integrates advanced deep learning technologies, including Large Language Models (LLMs), Agricultural Knowledge Graphs (KGs), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), representation learning, and neural-symbolic reasoning techniques. The system significantly enhances the accuracy and efficiency of disease detection through an innovative graph attention mechanism and optimized loss functions. Experimental results demonstrate that this system significantly outperforms traditional methods across key metrics such as precision, recall, and accuracy, with the graph attention mechanism excelling in all aspects, particularly achieving a precision of 0.94, a recall of 0.92, and an accuracy of 0.93. Furthermore, comparative experiments with various loss functions further validate the effectiveness of the graph attention loss mechanism in enhancing model performance. This research not only advances the application of deep learning in agricultural disease detection theoretically but also provides robust technological tools for disease management and decision support in actual agricultural production, showcasing broad application prospects and profound practical value.",
