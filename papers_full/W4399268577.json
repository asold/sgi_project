    "abstract": "Abstract The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) is expected to impact the job market significantly, accelerating automation trends and posing a risk to traditionally creative-oriented jobs. LLMs can automate tasks in various fields, including design, journalism, and creative writing. Companies and public institutions can leverage generative models to enhance productivity and reduce workforce requirements through machine-assisted workflows and natural language interactions. While technical skills like programming may become less important in certain roles, generative models are unlikely to fully replace programmers due to the need for expertise in code validation and niche development. The enterprise landscape of LLMs comprises providers (organizations training proprietary models), integrators (technology companies fine-tuning LLMs for specific applications), and users (companies and individuals adopting LLM-powered solutions). The applications of the models include conversational search, customer service chatbots, content creation, personalized marketing, data analysis, and basic workflow automation. The regulatory landscape is rapidly evolving, with key considerations including copyright, data security, and liability. Government involvement and informed expertise are recommended to guide governance and decision-making processes in this domain.",
