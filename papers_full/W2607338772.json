    "abstract": "Switching operations in gas-insulated switchgear (GIS) substations generate transient electromagnetic fields in the GIS pipes. These fields leak out discontinuities of the GIS and induce electromagnetic disturbance voltages on the cables and ports of secondary circuits. In smart GIS substations, secondary devices especially, such as the intelligent component of electronic instrument transformer, are vulnerable to electromagnetic interference. In this paper, the disturbance voltages induced on the ports of intelligent component of electronic instrument transformer had been measured in three 500-kV GIS substations, respectively. The disturbance was generated either during disconnector (DS) switching operations or circuit breaker (CB) operations. Then, the time-domain and frequency-domain characteristics of the disturbance waveforms have been analyzed. The micro-pulses of disturbance voltages have been extracted from the raw data. The waveform parameters, including peak voltage, rise-time, dominated frequency, and duration, have been calculated by the statistical analysis. The comparison between disturbance during DS switching operations and that of CB operations has been made. Also, the differences and similarities of disturbances between the three GIS substations have been displayed. Furthermore, the differences between measured waveforms and the IEC 61000-4-18 immunity test standard waveform have been discussed.",
