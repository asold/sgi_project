  "abstract": "Abstract Over the last decade, several regulatory bodies have started requiring the disclosure of non-financial information from publicly listed companies, in light of the investors’ increasing attention to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) issues. Publicly released information on sustainability practices is often disclosed in diverse, unstructured, and multi-modal documentation. This poses a challenge in efficiently gathering and aligning the data into a unified framework to derive insights related to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). Thus, using Information Extraction (IE) methods becomes an intuitive choice for delivering insightful and actionable data to stakeholders. In this study, we employ Large Language Models (LLMs), In-Context Learning, and the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigm to extract structured insights related to ESG aspects from companies’ sustainability reports. We then leverage graph-based representations to conduct statistical analyses concerning the extracted insights. These analyses revealed that ESG criteria cover a wide range of topics, exceeding 500, often beyond those considered in existing categorizations, and are addressed by companies through a variety of initiatives. Moreover, disclosure similarities emerged among companies from the same region or sector, validating ongoing hypotheses in the ESG literature. Lastly, by incorporating additional company attributes into our analyses, we investigated which factors impact the most on companies’ ESG ratings, showing that ESG disclosure affects the obtained ratings more than other financial or company data.",

These extracted\ntriples are then used to build a Knowledge Graph (KG), following the same research di-\nrection of recent studies based on OpenAI’s commercial LLMs [25–28].

Lastly, we present\nongoingdiscussions withinthesustainableﬁnanceliteratureinSect. 2.3.\n2.1 Knowledgegraphsgeneration\nKnowledge Graphs (KGs, [30, 31]) oﬀer a versatile method of representing knowledge\nthat can be leveraged in various use cases and domains [37, 38]. They can be applied to\nquestion-answering [39], recommendation systems [40], and information retrieval [29].\nThe task of KG generation, also known as knowledge acquisition, aims to create KGs by\nextracting information from unstructured, semi-structured or structured sources as well\nas augmenting existing graphs [38, 41, 42]. Traditional approaches for knowledge acqui-\nsition involve several NLP tasks which are generally disjointly learned, a process that is\nprone to error accumulation. To overcome this problem, new one-stage NLP pipelines\nhave been proposed to jointly extract both entities and relations [43,44].\nInthiscontext,OpenInformationExtraction(OIE,[ 45])emergedasthetaskofextract-\ningstructuredinformation,typicallyintheformofsubject-predicate-object(SPO)triples,\nwithoutrelyingonapredeﬁnedtemplateoraspeciﬁcdomain.TheseSPOtriplescanthen\nbe leveraged to generate knowledge graphs based on the subjects, predicates and objects\nextracted from textual documents. This approach can mitigate the impact of depending\non external knowledge, such as patterns and domain-speciﬁc heuristic rules present in\nthe training data. Recently, OIE models (e.g., Multi\n2OIE [46]a n dD e e p E x[47]) have em-\nployed transformer-based LLMs (e.g., BERT [48]) to extract both syntactic and semantic\ninformation[49].\nLLMstrainedonlarge-scalecorporahavedemonstratedsigniﬁcantpotentialacrossdi-\nverse NLP tasks thanks to the technique of prompt engineering [50]. Many researchers\n[25–28] have demonstrated the ability of LLMs (i.e., OpenAI’s GPT models) to extract\nstructured data from texts, accomplishing the KG generation task. Furthermore, LLMs\ncanenhanceKGsthroughseveralotherperspectives:(1)enrichentityandrelationrepre-\nsentationsusingembeddings,(2)generatenewfacts(i.e.,KGcompletion[ 51]),(3)produce\nnatural-language descriptions of KG facts (i.e., KG-to-text [52]) and (4) answer natural-\nlanguagequestions(i.e.,question-answering[ 50]).\nWe follow this promising research direction by exploiting the semantic understand-\ning, generative abilities and ﬂexibility of LLMs to extract ESG-related structured infor-\nmation. Our methodology adopts a Large Language Model, alongside the Retrieval Aug-\nmented Generation (RAG) paradigm [18] and the In-Context Learning (ICL) technique,\nto overcome the main limitation of conventional OIE methods in achieving our goal of\nextracting ESG-related structured insights: OIE methods traditionally extract structured\ninformation by relying only on the syntactical structure of a sentence, without any pre-\ndeﬁnedtemplate,whichposesimportantlimitationsinthetypeofinformationextracted.\nBronzinietal. EPJDataScience           (2024) 13:41 Page5of41\nThey may fail to extract, for example, information related to speciﬁc domains or activi-\nties that are not the direct subject of the sentence. An information extraction approach\nbased on generative LLMs allows us, instead, to generate semantically-aware and ESG-\noriented triples instead of traditional SPO triples, enabling the creation of a full-ﬂedged\nESG-orientedKG.\n2.2 TextanalyticsonESG-relatedinformation\nSeveral works have explored the use of NLP technology to process companies’ non-\nﬁnancialtextualinformationandextractmeaningfulinsightsconcerningstatements,facts\nand actions disclosed by companies. For example, Chouet al.[53] applied distributional\nsemantics on 10-K ﬁlings (i.e., annual ﬁnancial reports required by the U.S. Securities\nand Exchange Commission) for extracting topics related to climate change that are dis-\nclosedbycompanies,aimingtomonitorenvironmentalpolicycompliance.Raghupathi et\nal.

The authors also released a conversational\nagent [59] based on their proposed approach. Niet al.[60], developedChatReport,a n\nLLM-based tool that evaluates companies’ sustainability reports according to the eleven\nrecommendations [61] provided by the Task Force for Climate-Related Financial Disclo-\nsures (TCFD).

For instance, Baldiniet\nal. [33] found that a country’s labour union density positively impacts social and gover-\nnancedisclosure,whereasYu etal. [32]unveiledthatthelackofpoliticalrightshasanega-\ntiveinﬂuenceonESGdisclosure.Ontheotherhand,CSRmightalsobeinﬂuencedbyreg-\nulatoryagencies[ 62].Forexample,Europeancompaniesmightprioritiseenvironmental-\nrelated issues due to more stringent climate regulations in Europe, such as the European\nBronzinietal. EPJDataScience           (2024) 13:41 Page6of41\nUnion’s Emissions Trading System [64] or the ambitious “Fit for 55” plan [65]r e c e n t l y\nproposedbytheEuropeanUniontoachieve climate-neutralityby2050.\nThis greater European commitment towards environmental aspects might also cause\nbiases in benchmarking companies’ environmental performance. For example, the study\nof LaBellaet al.[66] unveiled the important role of ESG rating agencies and their biases\ntowards European companies. The authors [66] discovered a bias among rating agen-\ncies when evaluating ESG performance, showing a preference for European companies\novertheirNorthAmerican,EmergingMarkets,andDevelopedAsiancounterparts.They\nproposed that this bias could stem from variations in formal reporting requirements\nacross diﬀerent jurisdictions, contributing to diﬀerences in the quality of companies’\nnon-ﬁnancial disclosures [66]. This indirectly spotlights the pioneering and benchmark\nrole of European companies concerning non-ﬁnancial disclosures and CSR. Addition-\nally, there are other studies [63, 66, 67] that suggest non-ﬁnancial disclosures, and indi-\nrectly,companies’ESGassessments,mightalsosuﬀerfrombiasesbasedoncompanysize.\nThis is because generating non-ﬁnancial disclosures can be both ﬁnancially and labour-\nintensive [66]. As a result, larger companies could invest more economic and human re-\nsources in improving their non-ﬁnancial transparency, positively inﬂuencing their ESG\nevaluation.\nOntheotherhand,thecompany’sESGperformanceistraditionallyassessedrelativeto\nindustry peers due to industry-speciﬁc ESG concerns. This allows rating agencies (e.g.,\nReﬁnitiv)toassessacompany’ sESGperformancebyoutweighingtheESGtopicsrelevant\ntothecompany’sindustry.Forinstance,packagingcouldbemorerelevantforcompanies\nproducingconsumerstaples(e.g.,thebeverageindustry),whilematerialscompanies(e.g.,\nthe chemicals industry) might be aﬀected by physical-related topics such as Employee\nSafety. This factor has already emerged in the ESG literature [34–36] and is named ESG\nIndustry Materiality. In the ESG-related debate [68, 69], materiality generally identiﬁes\ntwotypesofsustainability issuesin anindustry: ﬁnancial materialityrefers to issues that\nmust be disclosed due to their potential signiﬁcant eﬀects on ﬁnancial performance, and\nimpactmateriality pertainstoinformationontheimpactofacompany’sactivitiesonthe\nsurrounding ecosystems and social systems. Whereas, reporting standard organizations,\nsuchastheSustainabilityAccountingStandardsBoard(SASB),\n2 identifyenvironmentally,\nsociallyorﬁnanciallyrelevantissuesforaspeciﬁcindustry(knownasmaterialitymatrix)\nthat necessitate disclosure, such as Water Management within the Non-Alcoholic Bev-\nerages industry. This aids companies in enhancing their disclosure of pertinent subjects\nwithin their industry. Our data-driven methodology enriches these ongoing discussions\nin the literature by providing structured insights on ESG topics directly extracted from\ncompanies’ non-ﬁnancial textual disclosures (Sect.4).

However, ESG reporting can be subjective and\nopaque due to the complexity of reporting qualitative aspects, particularly those related\nto social and governance issues [70]. Furthermore, the lack of a standardised framework\nforESGreportingmakesquantitative/comparativeanalysesdiﬃcult[ 71,72].\nWe initially collected 6456 sustainability reports from 4222 diﬀerent companies using\nthe report URLs available on two public websites [73, 74]. Although these sustainability\nreportsaremainlywritteninEnglish(94%ofalltheavailabledocuments),thenationality\nofthecompaniesisfairlydiversiﬁed,covering74diﬀerentcountries.However,themajor-\nity of the available reports (56%) come from North American companies. For our study,\nweconsideronlythereportswritteninEnglishbecauseofitsbroadcoverageandthewide\nrangeofpre-trainedlanguagemodelsavailableforthislanguage(manythousandsoflan-\nguagemodelsontheHuggingFaceplatform[ 75]).\nConcerning the period covered, we gather reports up to ﬁscal year 2022 (9.6% of the\navailabledocuments),eventhoughthemajorityofthedocuments(54%)refertotheﬁscal\nyear 2021 (i.e. a ﬁscal year is a twelve-month period that is generally equal to a calendar\nyear).

The two most\nwell-known ﬁltering methods for information retrieval are keyword-based and vector-\nbased search [81]. We adopt the approach of neural semantic search [82–85], a vector-\nbased search method, that exploits text embeddings to represent both documents and\nqueriesinthesamevectorspace.Relyingontextembeddingsallowsustomovetowardsa\nsemantic-oriented ﬁltering approach, reducing the dependency on single keywords, and\nthus on the ESG categorization adopted. This representation allows one to measure the\nsemantic similarity between a document and a query by simply computing the distance,\nandcontrarilythesimilarity,between theircorrespondingembeddedvectors[ 82].\nOur retrieval task involves discovering sentences related to each of the ESG categories\n(Sect. 3.1.2) within each sentence-segmented sustainability report. This implies working\nin asetting ofasymmetric semantic search in which queries (ESG categories) and corpus\ndocuments (company sentences) are not interchangeable as they represent diﬀerent se-\nmanticobjecttypesandhavediﬀerentlengths;similarlytothequestionansweringframe-\nwork[83,84].Incontrast,symmetricsemanticsearchisadoptedwhenqueriesandcorpus\ndocuments are interchangeable such as in similar document retrieval systems [86–88].\nAfterextensivetesting,wedeterminethat“INSTRUCTOR-xl”[ 89],aninstruction-tuned\nembedding model [90], is the most suitable choice for our speciﬁc tasks. The authors of\nthemodel[ 90]oﬀerauniversalinstructiontemplate(“Representthe[domain][texttype]\nfor[taskobjective]:”)alongwithanexamplelist.Sincewedealwithasymmetricsemantic\nsearch, the instructions provided to the model vary depending on the type of input.

We deﬁne an action (act) as the concatenation between the\nESGcategory( cat) andthepredicate (pred)ofa cat-pred-objtriple.\nConsequently, our goal requires knowing the semantic meaning of words as well as\ndeﬁningasemantictemplatetogenerateESG-orientedtriples.ThelatestOIEtechniques\n(Sect. 2.1) incorporate semantic information for extracting structured information, yet\ntheyrelyonlyonthesyntacticalstructureofthesentence.Forexample,giventhesentence:\n“Microsoft has invested 125 million in cutting-edge recycling technologies”,\n7 conventional\nOIEtechniques[ 91]wouldidentifyandgenerateatraditionalSPOtripleasthefollowing:\n(Microsoft, Invested, 125 million).AlthoughtheaboveSPOtriplecanwell\nrepresent the semantic meaning conveyed, it would not be suitable for our goal.

Accordingly, in this work, we employ\ninstruction-tuned LLMs, the In-Context Learning technique and the prominent RAG\nparadigm[18]toaddressthischallenge.Ourworkexploitsthesetechniquestoprovidean\nLLM with an input (ESG-related sentence) and an external context (input-output exam-\nplesandasemantic schema)toextractstructuredinformationfromthesentence.\nWe choose theKorlibrary [92] to create in-context instructions for LLMs.Korallows\nto programmatically construct prompts by specifying the semantic data schema for the\nideal triples (cat-pred-obj) as well as including labelled examples. A labelled example\nconnects an input sentence with the desired output, an ESG-oriented triple.

We integrated\nthe sixty-four ESG categories of the ESG categorization (Sect.3.1.2) in the description of\nthe attributecat. The LLM leverages this list of ESG topics as semantic guidance, aid-\ningitselfinthegenerationoftheESGcategoryforagiveninputsentence.Itachievesthis\nby mimicking the results of a supervised text classiﬁer, whose labels are those of the ESG\ncategorization, and extrapolating those labels with semantic generalization.

The redundancy in the KG\ncomesfromnodesandedgesrepresentingsimilarconceptsandtheirrelationshipsmulti-\npletimes.\nTo achieve this goal, we perform semantic clustering on all the ESG categories (cat)\nand predicates (pred) included in the generated triples. Firstly, we generate text embed-\ndings using the “INSTRUCTOR-xl” embedding model [90] with the model instruction\n“Represent the title”. Secondly, semantic clusters are discovered as high-density\nregions in the embedded vector space using cosine similarity as a metric. We conducted\nseveral empirical experiments to evaluate the cluster goodness using diﬀerent similarity\ncut-oﬀ thresholds, ranging from 0.5 to 0.9. Eventually, we adopt a similarity cut-oﬀ point\nof0.8,asitstrikesagoodbalancebetweenthesemanticcoherenceoftheclusterelements\n(clusterquality)andtheclustersizes.\nFinally, we label each cluster with its centroid and use cluster labels to replace the\noriginal ESG categories and predicates of the original triples.

(1)\nIn our context, the eventsX are the predicates disclosed by all companies for a given\nESG topic, whilep(x) represents their relative occurrences. High entropy denotes high\nvariabilityinthepredicateoccurrences,indicatinganESGtopicaddressedthroughmany\nactions (predicates) with an almost uniform probability of predicate occurrence. On the\nother hand, low entropy indicates the predominance of a limited set of predicates for an\nESGtopic.\n3.5.3 Similarityanalysis\nWeestimatecompanysimilaritiesbasedonjointlydisclosedESG-relatedactionsthrough\ntheJaccardsimilaritycoeﬃcient[ 104],whichmeasuresthesimilaritybetweentwosetsas\nthecardinalityoftheirintersection overthecardinalityoftheirunion:\nJ(\nAc1,Ac2)= |Ac1 ∩ Ac2|\n|Ac1 ∪ Ac2|,( 2 )\nwhere Aci is the set of ESG-related actions disclosed by companyci. To mitigate the in-\nﬂuenceofstochasticﬂuctuationsonthesimilarityscore,wegeneratedanullmodel[ 105]\nwith a bootstrapping technique by computing company similarities on the randomised\naction sets through 1000 simulations, and substracted this null model from the observed\ncompanysimilarities.\n3.5.4 Correlationanalysis\nWe evaluate whether company similarities in terms of jointly disclosed ESG-related ac-\ntions (Sect.3.5.3) are correlated to similarities in ESG scores or other company charac-\nteristics such as market capitalization or geographical location.

For example, if a company has ten percent of its generated\ntriplesconcerningtheESGcategory Waste, and that is within its top ten most disclosed\ntopics, the featureCategory:Waste for this observation has a value of 0.1. We also\nconsidertheproportionoftheE/S/Gpillarsbasedonallthedisclosedcategoriesforeach\ncompany. In addition, we compute the category and action entropy for each company,\nindirectly representing the cardinality of the ESG categories and actions disclosed in its\nsustainability report (Sect.3.5.2). Lastly, we consider nine company-related features as\nfurther predictors encompassing ﬁve company characteristics and four annual ﬁnancial\nattributes. Speciﬁcally, we include in our predictors the company sector, the country, re-\ngion and continent of its headquarters, and its incorporation year. On the other hand,\nwe also include ﬁnancial features concerning the ﬁscal year of the analysed sustainability\nreport:EBITDA(EarningsBeforeInterest,Taxes,DepreciationandAmortisation),liabil-\nities, marketcapitalizationandthenumberofemployees.\nThe descriptive statistics of these report-based and company-based predictors are ex-\nhibitedinFig. 5andTable 4.Categoricalvariables,suchasthecompanysector,areturned\ninto binary indicator variables (i.e., dummy variables [110]), generating a total of 97 fea-\ntureswhereasstandardisationisappliedtothosenumericalsuchasmarketcapitalization.\nAn example of an observation, encompassing a complete list of features, is exhibited in\nSect.SM2.5.1oftheSupplementaryMaterial(SM)document.\nBronzinietal.

We choose this regularisation method as\nit improves performance when the number of predictors (|features| =9 7)i sh i g h e rt h a n\nthe observations (|companies| =89) as well as in the presence of strong pairwise correla-\ntions[112].WetraintheOLSmodelusingtheElasticNetcostfunctionandaneight-fold\ncross-validation approach [114] (see Sect. SM2.5.3). The performance of the OLS model\nisdiscussedinAppendix E.\nSubsequently,weemploytheSHAPframework[ 13]toinvestigatewhichpredictorsim-\npact the inference of ESG scores most. SHAP is a model-agnostic and additive feature\nimportance measure which is based on cooperative game theory. It provides local inter-\npretations of model predictions as additive sums of the directed eﬀects of each predictor\nusing a conditional expectation function. SHAP starts from the prior knowledge of the\nexpected model outputE[f(X)], and then evaluates, for each model prediction, the mag-\nnitude and direction changes in this expected value (SHAP values) when conditioned on\neach predictor. It thus quantiﬁes the magnitude and direction of the observed eﬀects of\neachpredictor.\nPredictors with positive SHAP values aﬀect the expected model output with additive\nincrements,conversely, thosewithnegative valueshaveadditive decrementimpacts.\nBronzinietal.

Disclosing several ESG top-\nics (category entropy) positively aﬀects ESG scores, whereas fewer disclosed ESG\ntopics hurt scores. This data-driven insight accordingly conﬁrms that transparency on\nnon-ﬁnancial information rewards companies’ ESG assessment [63, 66]. The analysis\nof Sect. 4.5 also conﬁrms the negligible impact of governance-related topics towards\nESG scores in comparison to social- and environmental-related topics such asHuman\nRights, EnergyandWaste.TheﬁndingsofSect. 4.5alsounveilthatdisclosingmany\nactionsrelatedtotheESGtopics Employee DevelopmentandEnergynegativelyim-\npact ESG scores. One hypothesis is that their high presence in a company’s sustainability\nreport might reveal a poor coverage of other important ESG topics [76].

Further validation of the positive impact of being a European can be found by\ndelving into the environmental performance of European companies in our sample: they\ndemonstrate the highest average environmental score of 81.8, surpassing Asian compa-\nnies with an average score of 69 and American companies with the lowest average score\nof65.6(seeSect.SM1.5intheSupplementaryMaterialdocument).\nOn the otherhand, other studies suggest that companies’ ESG assessments might indi-\nrectly suﬀer from biases based on company size (Sect.2.3).

EPJDataScience           (2024) 13:41 Page29of41\n5.2 Methodologicalimplications\nAsmentioned in Sect.3.3, generative LLMs provide us with the semantic understanding\nand ﬂexibility needed to overcome the limitation of traditional OIE approaches which\nrely only on the syntactical sentence structure. However, employing a 7-billion LLM [16]\nfor information extraction (see Retrieval-Augmented Triple Generator in Fig.1)l e a d st o\na higher computational load. Nonetheless, this allows us to generate semantically aware\nand ESG-focused triples instead of traditional SPO ones. This is pivotal in generating all\nthemeaningfulESG-relatedinsightsofourwork.\nUtilising generative LLMs and the ESGcategorization for semantic guidance enhances re-\ntrievingmorecomprehensivedata-driveninsights Theﬂexibilityandgenerativeabilities\nof these generative language models also allow us to highlight, and overcome some lim-\nitations in the data sources such as those of the ESG categorization used in our work\n(Sect. 3.1.2). This categorization extrapolates a concise set of ESG topics by categorising\nseveralESG-relatedindicatorssharedamongESGratingproviders.Itaccordinglyderives\nthe scope of the ESG phenomenon from the perspective of rating agencies, a diﬀerent\nviewpointcomparedtocompanies’disclosuresanalysedinourwork.However,thesedif-\nferent points of view, and the methodology based on generative LLMs, help us to unveil\ndiﬀerencesamongtheESGtopicsconsideredbyratingagenciesanddisclosedbycompa-\nnies.WeindeedextractasetofESGtopics/categoriesdisclosedincompanies’sustainabil-\nityreportsthatiseighttimeslargerthantheoriginallistofcategoriesofthisclassiﬁcation\n(542 versus 64, Sect.5.1). For instance, our methodology unveils “Education”a sap i v -\notal ESG topic disclosed by more than two-thirds of the selected companies. This topic\nis not explicitly included in the categorization, although it could be framed within three\nof its categories: Access to Basic Services, Human rights (Art. 26) or Philanthropy. Addi-\ntional examples encompass the extracted ESG category “Circular Economy”w h i c h\nmightfallunderthecategorizationcategoriesof“Waste”or“ResourceEﬃciency” aswell\nas the ESG category “Air Quality” which could be framed within “Green Buildings”\nor“HealthandSafety”.\nAccordingly, the aforementioned ESG categorization encompasses critical topics hid-\nden within vague categories or potentially overlooks them altogether, resulting in a re-\nduction of substantial signiﬁcance in subsequent analyses. Our approach addresses this\nlimitationbyleveragingagenerativeLLMinconjunctionwiththeICLtechniqueandthe\nRAG paradigm. This allows us to jointly simulate the outputs of a supervised text classi-\nﬁer,whoselabelsarethecategoriesoftheESGcategorization,andsemanticallygeneralize\nthose labels. The ESG categorization is consequently leveraged as semantic guidance by\nthe LLM, helping itself to extract more suitable topics while keeping the domain and se-\nmantics of the original ESG categorization. This semantic generalization can also dimin-\nishtherelianceonspeciﬁcESGcategorizationswhenclassifyingsentencessincetheESG\ncategoriesareexploitedassemanticreferencesratherthanﬁxedlabels.Nevertheless,this\ncould also lead to the undesirable phenomenon of over-specialization which was tackled\nusing semantic clustering (Sect.3.4). We also used this ESG categorization, in the data\npreparation phase, to ﬁlter the report sentences using the text embeddings (Sect.3.2.1).\nThissemantic-orientedﬁlteringapproachallowsustofurthermovetowardsataxonomy-\nagnosticmethodologyasﬁlteringisbasedonsemanticsratherthansinglekeywords.\nBronzinietal. EPJDataScience           (2024) 13:41 Page30of41\nExtracting insights from companies’ sustainability reports using generative LLMs, and\ngraph representations Lastly, our methodology diﬀers from other recent ESG-focused\nand LLM-based tools (Sect.2)s u c ha sC h a t C l i m a t e[58]a n dC h a t R e p o r t[60]b ye m -\nploying the paradigm of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), alongside In-Context\nLearning, for Knowledge Graph generation. This methodology, in combination with bi-\npartite graph representation, allows us to report meaningful insights concerning the ac-\ntions disclosed in companies’ sustainability reports.

Although an end-to-end approach might\nbe desired, discarding such meaningless sentences beforehand could help avoid an un-\nnecessary computational workload. For instance, future works could tackle this issue by\nenhancing document parsing (e.g., by preserving the original layout) or adding a further,\nyet lightweight, ﬁltering component. The latter might ﬁlter sentences according to their\nsyntactical correctnessormeaningfulness.\nAnother potential limitation concerns the interpretability of ESG scores using SHAP\nvalues.TheSHAPframeworkisusedtoroughlyinterprettheimpactofpredictorsonin-\ndividual predictions. Global interpretability is derived using simple aggregating statistics\nsuch as mean/median SHAP values. Nevertheless, this aggregating approach for global\ninterpretability might result in a mixed global interpretation in the presence of high di-\nversity in the observations as can be a set of companies from worldwide nations cover-\ning eleven distinct sectors. The global impact of some predictors could still be accurate,\nyet some might be a mix of sector-dependent relationships or caused by the diversity of\ncause-eﬀectconnections.Indeed,theregion-basedinterpretabilityanalysis(Sect. 4.5)un-\nveilsmoreimpactingfactorsorrelationshipsforaspeciﬁccompanyclusterincomparison\nto the global interpretability (Sect.5.1).

EPJDataScience           (2024) 13:41 Page31of41\nLastly, the data provider for ESG scores used for our work might be a limitation worth\nhighlighting. We rely on the ESG scores from the Reﬁnitiv platform (Sect.3.1.3), but, as\nhighlighted in the Introduction Section, rating agencies have their assessment method-\nologies which could result in divergences in companies’ ESG scores. Consequently, the\nﬁndingsrelyingonESGscores(Sect. 4.4and4.5)mightvaryusingESGscoresfromother\nratingagenciessuchasSustainalyticswhichadoptsarisk-basedassessment[ 116].Inaddi-\ntion, future works could integrate further ESG-related attributes from these rating agen-\ncies such as quantifying companies’ water withdrawal, hazardous waste, gender pay gap\nandemployeeturnover.\n6C o n c l u s i o n s\nIn this work, we proposed a data-driven methodology based on generative LLMs to sys-\ntematically evaluate the context in which ESG topics are disclosed by companies in their\nsustainabilityreports.Theobjectiveofthisworkwastocontributetotheemergingﬁeldof\nautomatic information extraction from companies’ sustainability reports by implement-\ning the best NLP pipeline to extract structured insights from lengthy and visually rich\nPDF documents.
