  "abstract": "Hand gestures used in Indian Sign Language (ISL) are static and dynamic in the time domain. The Indian Sign Language is available as a standard but is still not very common among peoples. In this paper, we have used a 3-dimensional convolutional based Convolution Neural Network to model the most utilized gestures of the Indian community. The trained model can provide a natural language output corresponding to the signs of the ISL. This in turn will help in reducing the problems faced while communicating with deaf and dumb peoples. Moreover, these dynamic gestures can be used in medical, industrial and various other fields. We took 20 gestures from standard Indian Sign Language (ISL) and trained our model on the dataset made by replicating the actions of those gestures. Ten subjects volunteered to make the dataset in distinct backgrounds, light conditions and orientations. Network model used produced good results in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and f1-scores.",
