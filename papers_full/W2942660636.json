Case management services have been scaled \nup at community level with rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) providing antigen‑based detection of falciparum malaria \nonly. Key to national malaria elimination goals is the ability to identify, treat and eliminate all Plasmodium species. This \nstudy sought to determine the distribution of non‑falciparum malaria and assess the performance of diagnostic tests \nfor Plasmodium falciparum in Western and Southern Provinces of Zambia, two provinces planned for early malaria \nelimination.\nMethods: A sub‑set of individuals’ data and samples from a cross‑sectional household survey, conducted during \npeak malaria transmission season in April and May 2017, was used. The survey collected socio‑demographic informa‑\ntion on household members and coverage of malaria interventions. Malaria testing was done on respondents of all \nages using blood smears and RDTs while dried blood spots were collected on filter papers for analysis using photo‑\ninduced electron transfer polymerase chain reaction (PET‑PCR). Slides were stained using Giemsa stain and examined \nby microscopy for malaria parasites.\nResults: From the 1567 individuals included, the overall prevalence of malaria was 19.4% (CI 17.5–21.4) by PCR, 19.3% \n(CI 17.4–21.4) by RDT and 12.9% (CI 11.3–14.7) by microscopy. Using PET‑PCR as the gold standard, RDTs showed \na sensitivity of 75.7% (CI 70.4–80.4) and specificity of 94.2% (CI 92.8–95.4). The positive predictive value (PPV) was \n75.9% (CI 70.7–80.6) and negative predictive value (NPV) was 94.1% (CI 92.1–95.4). In contrast, microscopy for sensi‑\ntivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV values were 56.9% (CI 51.1–62.5), 97.7% (CI 96.7–98.5), 85.6% (CI 80.0–90.2), 90.4% (CI \n88.7–91.9), respectively. Non‑falciparum infections were found only in Western Province, where 11.6% of P . falciparum \ninfections were co‑infections with Plasmodium ovale or Plasmodium malariae.\nConclusion: From the sub‑set of survey data analysed, non‑falciparum species are present and occurred as mixed \ninfections. As expected, PET‑PCR was slightly more sensitive than both malaria RDTs and microscopy to detecting \nmalaria infections.\nKeywords: Malaria, Mixed infections, Non‑falciparum infection, Rapid diagnostic tests, Zambia\n© The Author(s) 2019.

Malar J          (2019) 18:130 \nBackground\nPlasmodium falciparum  is the major cause of malaria \nin Africa, while P. vivax is the most widely distributed \nspecies outside Africa [1], and in a few African coun -\ntries, such as Ethiopia [2] and Uganda [3]. Compared \nwith these two dominant species, Plasmodium malar\n-\niae and Plasmodium ovale are significantly rarer and to \na large extent are under-studied. Plasmodium ovale has \nbeen reported to be primarily distributed throughout \nsub-Saharan Africa [4]. Plasmodium malariae is found \nin tropical Africa where co-infections are sometimes \nencountered with P. falciparum [5].\nMalaria remains a major public health problem in \n91 countries worldwide, despite being preventable and \ntreatable. It was linked to 216 million cases and 445,000 \ndeaths in 2016, of which 90% were in sub-Saharan \nAfrica [6]. Zambia has recorded a drop in malaria inci\n-\ndence from 407 cases per 1000 population in 2014 to \n335 cases per 1000 population in 2015 [7] and it contin\n-\nues to make strides in reducing malaria cases through \nthe use of proven and effective malaria interventions. It \nrecently pledged to eliminate malaria altogether, through \nsustained universal coverage of vector control interven\n-\ntions, which include indoor residual spraying (IRS), dis -\ntribution of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs) \nand larval source management (LSM). Other important \nstrategies include case management, health promotion, \nsurveillance, and research [8]. Case management ser\n-\nvices are increasingly occurring at community level with \nstandard rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) providing antigen-\nbased detection of falciparum malaria only and treatment \nwith artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) for \nuncomplicated malaria coupled with injectable artesu\n-\nnate for severe cases. In addition, mass drug administra -\ntion (MDA) has been included as an potential accelerator \nof the malaria elimination process [8].\nPrompt and accurate case management of malaria \ninfections is dependent on the performance of diag\n-\nnostic tools. Readily available diagnostic tools include \nlight microscopy of blood smears, RDTs, and molecular \napproaches such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and \nloop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) [9, 10], \nalthough PCR is mostly used for research and not routine \nclinical diagnosis. Expert malaria microscopy remains an \nideal diagnostic for malaria but due to a number of fac\n-\ntors it cannot be used in all health facilities, hence the use \nof RDTs. RDTs are immunochromatographic tests that \ndetect one or more of a range of antigens, namely histi\n-\ndine-rich protein 2 (HRP2), Plasmodium  lactate dehy -\ndrogenase (pLDH) and aldolase [11]. Aldolase and pLDH \nare enzymes in the glycolytic pathway, while HRP2 is a \nwater-soluble protein that is produced by asexual tropho\n-\nzoites and young gametocytes [12]. As HRP2 is produced \nexclusively during the asexual stages of the life cycle of P. \nfalciparum, RDTs based on HRP2 detection are specific \nfor P. falciparum [13], and are the only RDTs used in gov\n-\nernment health facilities in Zambia. RDTs are easy to use, \ndo not require specialized training, can be performed in \na clinic, health centre and hospital in the absence of elec\n-\ntricity, and give results rapidly [14]. For these reasons, \nthey have been widely adopted even at the lowest level in \nservice delivery, the community level [15].\nAs with any diagnostic, there are limits to their util\n-\nity and in some settings have shown poor sensitivity \nand specificity. For example, in a holo-endemic area of \nnorthern Tanzania, the sensitivity of the ParaHIT test \nwas found to be 10.7% [16], while the sensitivity of the \nSD-Bioline test assessed in South Kivu Province of the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo was found to be \n82.1% with a specificity of 92.0%, using microscopy as the \nstandard [17]. The World Health Organization (WHO) \nrecommended a threshold for sensitivity of > 95% and a \nthreshold for specificity of > 90 [18].\nAs a country moves toward malaria elimination, it is \ncrucial to ensure that all malaria cases irrespective of the \ninfecting species are diagnosed and treated promptly. In \nZambia, the distribution of Plasmodium  species is not \nwell defined. Despite this, HRP2-based RDTs are used for \ndiagnosis in all facilities where microscopy is not avail\n-\nable. This decision was based on information suggest -\ning that 98% of malaria in Zambia was P. falciparum, 2% \nwere P. malariae, while P. vivax is a rare infection [19], \nwhich may not have changed over the years. For example, \na cross-sectional study conducted in high transmission \nareas in Eastern and Luapula Provinces revealed approxi\n-\nmately 10.6% of all P. falciparum infections were co-\ninfections with one or more other Plasmodium  species. \nIt is possible that in low transmission settings, the species \ndistribution is different again, as species characterised \nby chronic infections (P. malariae) or dormant lifecycle \nstages (P. vivax and P. ovale) may constitute an increasing \nproportion of infections because of the chronic nature \nof P. malariae and the presence of the hypnozoite stages \nP. ovale and P. vivax [20]. These non-falciparum species \npotentially require additional interventions such as an \nanti-hypnozoite drug, e.g., primaquine.\nMethods\nStudy design\nA group of individuals were enrolled in across-sectional \nhousehold survey conducted during peak malaria trans\n-\nmission season in April and May 2017, as part of ongo -\ning efforts by the Zambia Ministry of Health, the PATH \nMalaria Control and Elimination Partnership in Africa \n(MACEPA) and other partners to evaluate malaria elimi\n-\nnation efforts across Southern and Western Provinces.\nPage 3 of 9\nSitali et al. Malar J          (2019) 18:130 \nThe survey collected socio-demographic information \non household members, coverage of malaria interven -\ntions, and additional social and behavioural information \nrelated to use of malaria interventions. As well as testing \nfor malaria in the field with an RDT (SD Bioline malaria \nAg pf, Standard Diagnostics Inc., Republic of Korea), a \nthick blood smear and a dried blood spot (DBS) was col\n-\nlected for analysis at the National Malaria Elimination \nCentre (NMEC) laboratory.\nThe sampling methods for each province were dif\n-\nferent due to historical studies and enumeration in \nthe two provinces. In Southern Province, there was a \npre-existing sampling frame used during a previously \nimplemented MDA trial. In the trial sampling from the \n10 districts along Lake Kariba, 52 households were ran\n-\ndomly selected from each of the 60 health facility catch -\nment areas. In Western Province, where there was no \npre-existing household sampling frame, a two-stage \ncluster sampling with clusters selected using probability \nproportional to size (a standardized method from the \ncountry’s Malaria Indicator Survey) was used to select 25 \nhouseholds from 24 census-derived standard enumera\n-\ntion areas [21, 22]. All consenting or assenting individu -\nals above 1 month of age (n = 6977) were enrolled in the \ntwo surveys. Those that were severely sick, were taken to \nclinic by survey staff, but information about them would \nbe collected from the household respondent and no fin\n-\nger stick data would be collected.\nWith the help of OpenEpi software (Emory University, \nRollins School of Public Health, USA) [23], ~ 300 samples \nwere calculated using the prevalence of different spe\n-\ncies at 10.6% [34] rounding up to 11% for high transmis -\nsion areas, and estimating 2% in low transmission areas, \naccuracy could be determined with 80% power and 95% \nconfidence.\nAfter excluding 41 clusters that were outliers by RDT \nprevalence, a total of 13 clusters were then randomly \nselected: 6 from Western (high RDT prevalence) and 7 \nfrom Southern (low RDT prevalence). All individuals \nfrom these clusters with complete survey data, includ\n-\ning RDT and microscopy results, together with an iden -\ntifiable DBS were selected for PCR speciation analysis \n(n = 1567), while those with insufficient blood and miss\n-\ning data were excluded. Due to time and cost of doing \nPCRs, all 6977 samples could not be analysed.\nStudy area\nThe two provinces, Western and Southern, cover approx-\nimately 126,386  km2 (17% Western) and 85,823 km2 (11% \nSouthern) of the total Zambia landmass, and are home \nto 902,974 (Western) and 1,589,926 (Southern) people, \naccording to the 2010 population census. The Zambezi \nRiver flows through both provinces and the plains cover \nabout 10% of the total area of Western Province. Tonga-\nspeaking people in Southern and Lozi-speaking people \nin Western are the predominant ethnic groups [24, 25]. \nA map of Zambia in Fig.  1 shows the location of these \ntwo provinces. Malaria transmission varies greatly across \nthese two provinces, with traditionally higher transmis\n-\nsion intensity in Southern Province along Lake Kariba \nand in areas of Western Province around the swamps and \nwetlands in Luampa, Kaoma and Nkeyema districts and \nalong the Zambezi River basin [21, 22, 26]. The rest of the \nareas away from water bodies have low transmission.\nLaboratory methods\nMicroscopy\nBlood smears for microscopy were prepared in the field \nby trained biomedical scientists, air dried in a dust-free \nenvironment and stored in slide boxes. They were then \ntransported to the NMEC where they were stained using \n3% Giemsa for 45  min. The slides were examined inde\n-\npendently by two experienced biomedical scientists.\nDNA extraction\nDNA was extracted from 6 mm (~ 13.8 µl whole blood) \nDBS punch(es)using a Qiagen DNA mini kit (Qiagen, \nGermany) and eluted in 100  µl. All RDT-positive sam\n-\nples were extracted alone, while RDT-negatives were \nextracted in pools of 10, and deconvoluted if positive.\nPCR analysis\nPET-PCR (real-time PCR technique), as previously \ndescribed in 2013 by Lucchi et  al. [27] was used to \namplify Plasmodium 18S ribosomal RNA (see Table  1 \nmaterials for sequences). Briefly, 5  µl of DNA template \n(~ 0.7 µl whole blood) was amplified in a 20-µl reaction as \nfollows: 95 °C for 15 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95 °C \nfor 20  s and 60  °C for 40  s. Samples were analysed in \nduplicate and scored positive if both duplicates had a CT \nvalue < 40. The amplicon sizes were 109 bp P. falciparum, \n137 bp P. malariae, 74 bp P. ovale, and 82 bp P. vivax [28, \n29].\nStatistical analysis\nDemographic and laboratory data of participants’ records \nwere analysed using Stata version 13 (College Station, \nTexas, USA). Fisher’s exact test for proportions was used \nto assess the association between variables and mixed \nand non-falciparum infection.\nDiagnostic method performance was assessed against \nPCR as the gold standard as sensitivity [true posi\n-\ntive (TP)/(TP + false negative (FN))], specificity [(TN)/\n(TN + false positive (FP))], positive predictive value \n(PPV) [TP/(TP + FP)]and negative predictive value \n(NPV) [TN/(TN + FN)]. The results were interpreted \nPage 4 of 9Sitali et al. Malar J          (2019) 18:130 \nFig. 1 Map of Zambia showing location of Southern and Western Provinces.

Age, \ngender, reported travel history, LLIN ownership were \nsimilar across both provinces, while IRS coverage was \nmarkedly higher in Southern (67.2%) compared to West\n-\nern Province (31.6%).\nMalaria prevalence determined by RDT or PCR was \nbroadly similar across both provinces, while microscopy \nwas significantly lower. In contrast, Western Province \nhad a significantly higher prevalence of malaria as com\n-\npared to Southern, 55 versus 4% by PCR (Fig.  2). The \nmajority of all PCR-positive infections were P. falcipa -\nrum mono-infections with 85.7 and 97.8% in Western \nand Southern, respectively. No mixed/co-infections were \nfound in Southern Province, but 11.6% of all positives \nin Western had more than one species present (Fig.  3). \nA total of 8 non-falciparum mono-infections were also \nidentified.

Interestingly, the diversity of para -\nsite species found in a province broadly correlated to the \nmalaria prevalence, i.e., the higher the prevalence the \ngreater the number of species found. From these data \nalone, it seems clear that non-falciparum infections are \nunder-reported due to the use of P. falciparum-specific \nRDTs and challenges in achieving high quality micros\n-\ncopy [31, 32].\nOverall, 97% of all malaria infections contained P. \nfalciparum , of which 89% were mono-infections and \n11.6% co-infections and very few mono non-falciparum \ninfections were identified (< 3% of all infections). These \nfindings are in agreement with previous studies which \nreported 10.6% mixed infections and 88% P. falciparum  \n[33], and are also close to 98% P. falciparum reported \nby Wolfe [34].

Malar J          (2019) 18:130 \nthat transmission of each species is occurring in the \nsame geography/human population. It is well known \nthat some mosquito species are capable of transmit\n-\nting multiple parasite species, e.g. Anopheles gambiae  \nis able to transmit all Plasmodium  species [35] and is \nfound throughout Southern and Western Provinces. \nWhile the vectorial capacity for transmission is present \nin both provinces, it is unclear how much non-P. falci\n-\nparum transmission is local and how much is imported \nthrough travel [35]. Considering the numbers, it is \nentirely plausible that P. malariae in Southern Province \nis maintained through importation, while there is more \nrobust local non-P. falciparum transmission in West\n-\nern Province. No association was found between travel \nhistory and presence of non-falciparum infections \nhowever, only travel in the last month was recorded. \nConsidering non-falciparum malaria infections may be \nchronic or dormant for long periods of time, it is not \npossible to determine the source of infections in this \nstudy. Genotyping of the parasite population may help \ndissect this relationship by defining the parasite popu\n-\nlation diversity and relatedness of different infections.\nOften the non-falciparum species are under-reported \nor not identified due to a number of factors: the use of P. \nfalciparum -specific RDTs as observed in approximately \n63% of health facilities in Zambia [36] and microscopy-\nrelated challenges, such as inadequate experience and \ntraining of microscopists to identify parasites other \nthan P. falciparum [ 31, 32]. Other factors include mor\n-\nphological changes induced by haemolysis hampering \nthe identification of the species [31].\nWhile evidence for P. vivax transmission exists [37], \nthe majority of the Zambian population are expected to \nbe resistant to P. vivax infections due to carrying the \nDuffy FyFy genotype [38]. It was, therefore, surprising \nto find P. vivax, albeit in only one person. There is evi\n-\ndence of low-level P. vivax endemicity in sub-Saharan \nAfrica [39, 40]. Evidence from the Malaria Atlas Project \n(MAP) shows that Zambia’s neighbours, Democratic \nRepublic of Congo, Namibia, Botswana and Angola, \nhave cases of P. vivax [ 39].\nThe sensitivity value was below the 95% threshold for \nboth RDTs and microscopy when compared to PCR, \nwhile specificity was above the recommended 90%. The \nfindings of RDT sensitivity of 75.5% using PCR as gold \nstandard is consistent with other publications on RDT \nsensitivity e.g., 88.6% in mainland Tanzania [41], 76.5% \nin Zanzibar [42] and 75.4% in Kisumu, Kenya [43].\nIn this study RDTs and microscopy had a relatively \nlow PPV (< 90%), meaning that many positives were not \ninfected, which in turn affects malaria morbidity, preva\n-\nlence and incidence estimates [43]. Furthermore, treat -\nment given to false positives is potentially costly and \nmay lead to inaccurate perceptions of therapeutic fail\n-\nures [43]. A proportion of false positive individuals may \nreflect a recent resolved past infection due to HRP2 per\n-\nsistence. Conversely, a proportion of false negatives could \nbe due to the functional loss of HRP2 expression, e.g., \nthrough a gene deletion as has been reported in neigh\n-\nbouring DRC [44]. Finally, the prozone effect in hyper-\nparasitaemic infections could also account for some of \nthe false negatives [45, 46], although in this study the cor\n-\nrelation between parasite density and false negatives was \nnot assessed.\nStudy limitations and strengths\nResults of this study should be interpreted keeping some \nlimitations in mind. Firstly, there was no similar pre-\n2017 analysis of species in Southern Province to indicate \nwhether there was previously a higher level of mixed and \nnon-falciparum species present. This makes it difficult \nto be certain if the elimination activities in the province \nare responsible for the low positivity rate. Secondly, these \ndata cannot be generalized to the whole country, as this \nanalysis is for two provinces, despite representing lower \nand higher transmission zones (low meaning an area with \nparasitaemia less than 5% and high meaning an area with \nparasitaemia above 15%), and the moderate transmission \nzone is not represented. Thirdly, an element of selection \nbias cannot be excluded as clusters with zero RDT preva\n-\nlence were excluded. It is possible that the clusters may \nhave had non-falciparum species leading to underestima\n-\ntion of the species. Finally, the study used secondary data \nand the authors have little or no control of RDT results, \nwhich may have affected the sensitivity and specificity \nresults. Four samples from participants that were RDT-\npositive and PCR-negative, who were given treatment \nwithin 14 days, were included in the analysis. It is possi\n-\nble that the positive RDTs could have been due to lagging \nantigenaemia. Although on recalculation of sensitivity \nand specificity, new figures were within the same range as \nthose previously calculated.\nTable 5 Performance of  RDTs compared with  microscopy \nresults\nRDT Microscopy\nPositive Negative Total\nPositive 164 139 303 Se = 81.2% (75.1, 86.3), \nSp = 89.8% (88.1, 91.4), \nPpv = 54.1% (48.3, \n59.8), Npv = 97.0% \n(95.9, 97.8)\nNegative 38 1226 1264\nTotal 202 1365 1567\nPage 8 of 9Sitali et al. Malar J          (2019) 18:130 \nConclusion\nThere is a concern that other species could continue to \ndrive transmission but remain undetected, as the RDTs \ncurrently used in Zambia detect only P. falciparum. \nWhile this study confirms that P. falciparum dominates, \na not-insignificant 9.9% of these infections were mixed \nwith another species. Encouragingly, where malaria is \nclosest to elimination (i.e., in Southern Province), non-\nfalciparum infections identified in this study were mini\n-\nmal (1 case). This may suggest that interventions that \nreduce P. falciparum transmission also impact non-fal\n-\nciparum species. It is important to expand surveillance \nactivities to monitor non-falciparum infections and \nensure this remains the case.\nFrom the finding, recommendation made include: the \nnational malaria programme consider increasing capac\n-\nity to diagnose and detect non-falciparum species. This \ncan be done through strengthening diagnosis quality \nassurance, increase access to functional microscopy, and \nprovide refresher training in malaria microscopy for all \nlaboratory staff, and in addition, introduce Pan RDTs \n(RDTs able to diagnose P. falciparum and non-falciparum \nspecies).\nAbbreviations\nAL: artemether–lumefantrine; HRP2: histidine‑rich protein 2; DBS: dried blood \nspot; DNA: deoxyribonucleic acid; ITN: insecticide‑treated net; IRS: indoor \nresidual spraying; LLINs: long‑lasting insecticide‑treated nets; LSM: larval \nsource management; NPV: negative predictive value; NMEC: National Malaria \nElimination Centre; NMCP: National Malaria Control Programme; MACEPA: \nMalaria Control and Elimination Partnership in Africa; MDA: mass drug \nadministration; MIS: Malaria Indicator Survey; PCR: polymerase chain reaction; \nPET‑PCR: photo‑induced electronic transfer‑polymerase chain reaction; pLDH: \nparasite lactate dehydrogenase; PPV: positive predictive value; RDTs: rapid \ndiagnostic tests.\nAuthors’ contributions\nLS conceived the idea, run the samples and drafted the manuscript, MCM \nassisted in the running of the samples and writing the methods and correct‑\ning the manuscript.
