Low dose computed tomography (LDCT) has attracted more\nand more attention in routine clinical diagnosis assessment, therapy plan-\nning, etc., which can reduce the dose of X-ray radiation to patients.\nHowever, the noise caused by low X-ray exposure degrades the CT im-\nage quality and then aﬀects clinical diagnosis accuracy.

Then,\nwe extract content features (XLc ) and latent texture features (XLt ) from\nthe LF part, as well as HF embeddings (XHf ) from the HF part.

Extensive experiments on Mayo\nLDCT dataset show that our method produces superior results and out-\nperforms other methods.\n1 Introduction\nComputed tomography (CT) system, as noninvasive imaging equipment, has\nbeen widely used for medical diagnosis and treatment [18,16]. However, concerns\nabout the increase of X-ray radiation risk have become an unavoidable problem\nfor all CT vendors and medical institutions [2]. Since x-ray imaging is mainly\nbased on a photon-noise-dominated process [27], lowering the X-ray dose will\nresult in degraded CT images. Therefore, on the premise of ensuring CT image\nquality, how to reduce the X-ray radiation dose as far as possible becomes a\npromising and signiﬁcant research topic [2].\nCompared to sparse or limited-view CT [33] and other hardware-based strate-\ngies [34], lowering single X-ray exposure dose [11,22] is the most convenient and\naﬀordable method. To obtain high-quality LDCT images, previous works can\nbe mainly classiﬁed into two categories: model-based and data-driven methods.\nThe key to model-based methods is to use a mathematical model for the de-\nscription of each process of CT imaging: noise characteristics in the sinogram\ndomain [15,30], image prior information in the image domain, such as sparsity\narXiv:2103.00634v4  [eess.IV]  5 Jul 2021\n2 Z. Zhang et al.\nin gradient domain [13] and low rank [3], as well as defects in CT hardware\nsystems [32]. This kind of methods are independent of a large training dataset,\nwhile the accuracy of the model depiction limits its performance.\nWith the development of deep learning in medical image reconstruction and\nanalysis [29], many data-driven works have been proposed to reconstruct LDCT\nimages with convolution neural network (CNN) [25]. Kang et al. proposed a\nCNN-based neural network with the assistance of directional wavelets, suggest-\ning the potential of deep learning technique in LDCT. Similarly, Chen et al.\nemployed residual learning to extract noise in the LDCT images and obtain su-\nperior performance [5]. However, these methods need FBP-reconstructed LDCT\nimages as the inputs, which belong to image post-processing. To get rid of the\ninﬂuence of traditional analytic algorithms (e.g. FBP), Zhu et al.suggested that\n‘AUTOMAP’ was a direct reconstruction method from the measurement data to\nthe ﬁnal image [35]. Then again, the ﬁrst fully-connected layer as domain trans-\nform has a huge memory requirement, which makes AUTOMAP unavailable for\nlarge-scale CT reconstruction [24]. Besides, many works with the combination of\niterative reconstruction and deep learning have been proposed as deep unrolled\napproaches. This kind of method used CNNs as special regularizations plugged\ninto conventional iterative reconstruction. They not only inherit the advantages\nof the convenient calculation of system matrix in conventional algorithms but\nalso get rid of the complicated manual design regularization [10,7,11].\nDespite the success of CNNs in LDCT reconstruction, CNN-based methods\nheavily rely on cascaded convolution layers to extract high-level features since\nthe convolution operation has its disadvantage of a limited receptive ﬁeld that\nonly perceives local areas. Moreover, this disadvantage makes it diﬃcult for\nCNN-based methods to make full of the similarity across large regions [26,31],\nwhich makes CNN-based methods less eﬃcient in modeling various structural\ninformation in CT images [14]. To overcome this limitation, Transformers [23],\nwhich solely depend on attention mechanisms instead, have emerged as a power-\nful architectures in many ﬁelds, such as natural language processing (NLP) [8],\nimage segmentation [6],image recognition [9], etc. In addition to these high-level\ntasks, Transformer has also been tentatively investigated for some lower-level\ntasks [28,4], which can model all pairwise interactions between image regions\nand capture long-range dependencies by computing interactions between any\ntwo positions, regardless of their positional distance.\nFor image denoising, noise is mainly contained in the high-frequency sub-\nband. Moreover, the remaining low-frequency sub-band not only contains the\nmain image content, but also contains the weakened image textures, which are\nnoise-free. These weakened image textures can be used to help noise removal\nin the high-frequency sub-band. Inspired by this observation, in this paper,\nwe present the ﬁrst work, TransCT, to explore the potential of transformers\nin LDCT imaging. Firstly, we decompose the noisy LDCT image into high-\nfrequency (HF) and low-frequency (LF) parts. To remove the image noise on the\npremise of retaining the image content, we extract the corresponding content\nfeatures (XLc ) and latent texture features ( XLt ) from the LF part.

Sub-Pixel layer is the upsampling layer [21].\nously, we extract the corresponding embeddings (XHf ) from the HF part. Since\ntransformers can only use sequences as input, we then convert XLt and XHf\ninto separated sequences as the input of transformer encoder and decoder, re-\nspectively. To preserve the ﬁne details of the ﬁnal LDCT images, we integrate\nthe output of the transformer decoder and some speciﬁc features from the LF\npart and then piecewise reconstruct high-quality and high-resolution LDCT im-\nages by stages. Extensive experiments on Mayo LDCT dataset demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our method over other methods.\n2 Method\nFig 1 illustrates the overview of our proposed framework. For image denoising,\nan intuitive solution is to decompose the noisy image into HF and LF parts, and\nthen the noise is mainly left in the HF part, which also contains plenty of image\ntextures. However, noise removal only in the HF part breaks the relationship\nbetween the HF and LF parts since there are also weakened latent textures in\nthe LF part with reduced noise. Therefore, we can remove the noise in the HF\npart with the assistance of the latent textures from the LF part. In this work,\ngiven the noisy LDCT image X with the size of H×W, we ﬁrst use a Gaussian\nﬁlter with a standard deviation of 1 .5 to decompose the LDCT image into two\ncompositions: HF part XH and LF part XL.\nX = XH + XL (1)\nTo use the latent textures in XL, we ﬁrstly extract the corresponding con-\ntent fetatures XLc and texture features XLt from XL using shallow two CNNs.\nFurther, we use these texture features and embeddings fromXH to train a trans-\nformer and get high-level features of XH, combined with content features from\nXL to reconstruct the ﬁnal high-quality LDCT image.\n4 Z. Zhang et al.\n2.1 TransCT\nSequence Similar with what other works have done [6], we ﬁrstly employ two\nconvolution layers with stride 2 to obtain low-resolution features from XL, and\nthen set two paths to extract content features XLc1 (H\n8 ×W\n8 ×64), XLc2 ( H\n16 ×\nW\n16 ×256) and latent texture feature XLt ( H\n32 ×W\n32 ×256), respectively. For XH,\nwe employ sub-pixel layer to make XH to be low-resolution images ( H\n16 ×W\n16 ×\n256), and ﬁnal high-level features XHf can be obtained with three convolution\nlayers. The goal is to get a sequence of moderate dimensions eventually. To take\nadvantage of the characteristic of long-range dependencies of transformers, we\nperform tokenization by reshaping XLt and XHf into two sequences SL, SH,\nrespectively.\nTransformer In this work, we employ a modiﬁed transformer with three en-\ncoders and three decoders, each encoder includes a multi-head attention module\n(MHSA) and a feed-forward layer (MLP) and each decoder consists of two multi-\nhead attention modules and a feed-forward layer, as can be seen in Fig 1. For\ntransformer encoder, we use SL (WH\n1024 ×256) as the input token, followed by a\nmulti-head attention module to seek the global relationship across large regions,\nand then we use two fully-connected layers (whose number of the node are 8 c\nand c, respectively. c is the dimension of the input sequence) to increase the\nexpressive power of the entire network.\nZ = MHSA(Si−1\nL ) + Si−1\nL\nSi\nL = MLP(Z) + Z\ns.t. i ∈{1,2,3}\n(2)\nAfter acquiring the latent texture features S3\nL from XL, we feed SH (WH\n256 ×\n256) into the ﬁrst multi-head attention module and treatS3\nL as the key and value\nof each transformer decoder in the second multi-head attention module.\nZ = MHSA(Si−1\nH ) + Si−1\nH\nZ = MHSA(Z,S3\nL,S3\nL) + Z\nSi\nH = MLP(Z) + Z\ns.t. i ∈{1,2,3}\n(3)\nPiecewise Reconstruction Since the transformer only output features Y, we\ncombine Y with XLc1 , XLc2 to piecewise reconstruct the ﬁnal high-quality LDCT\nimages. In our work, the output of the transformer has the size of H\n16 ×W\n16 ×256.\nHere, we reconstruct the high-resolution LDCT image piecewise. In the ﬁrst\nstep, we add Y and XLc2 and then feed the output into a ResNet with two\n‘Conv2d + Leaky-ReLU(lrelu)’ layers, followed by a sub-pixel layer which results\nin higher-resolution features with size of H\n8 ×W\n8 ×64. Similarly, we add these\nhigher-resolution features and XLc1 . After another ResNet with two ‘Conv2d\nTransCT 5\n+ lrelu’ layers and sub-pixel layer, we can get the ﬁnal output with the size of\nH×W\n2.2 Loss Function\nThe MSE measures the diﬀerence between the output and normal dose CT\nimages (NDCT), which reduces the noise in the input LDCT images. Formally,\nthe MSE is deﬁned as follows:\nmin\nθ\nL= ||IND −Fθ(ILD)||2\n2 (4)\nWhere IND is the NDCT image and ILD is the LDCT image, F is the\nproposed model and θ denotes the network parameters.\n2.3 Implementation\nIn this work, the proposed framework was implemented in python based on\nTensorﬂow [1] library. We used the Adam [12] optimizer to optimize all the pa-\nrameters of the framework. We totally trained 300 epochs with a mini-batch\nsize of 8. The learning rate was set as 0.0001 in the ﬁrst 180 epochs and then\nreduced to 0.00001 for the next 120 epochs. The conﬁguration of our com-\nputational platform is Intel(R) Core(Tm) i7-7700K CPU @4.20GHZ, 32 GB\nRAM, and a GeForce GTX TITAN X GPU with 12 GB RAM. We initialized\nall the variations with xavier initialization. Our code is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/zzc623/TransCT\n3 Experiments\nDatasets In this work, we used a publicly released dataset for the 2016 NIH-\nAAPM-Mayo Clinic Low-Dose CT Grand Challenge3 [17]. In this dataset, normal-\ndose abdominal CT images of 1 mm slice thickness were taken from 10 anony-\nmous patients and the corresponding quarter-dose CT images were simulated by\ninserting Poisson noise into the projection data. To better train the proposed\nTransCT, we divided the original 10 training patient cases into 7/1/2 cases,\nrelated to the training/validation/testing datasets, respectively. Before network\ntraining, we converted CT value of each pixel into its corresponding attenuation\nvalue under the assumption that the x-ray source was monochromatic at 60 keV.\nComparison with other methods We compared our method with baseline\nmethods: Non-local Mean (NLM), RED-CNN [5], MAP-NN [19], which are the\nhigh-performance LDCT methods. NLM can be found in the scikit-image li-\nbrary4. Since there is no public well-trained model for RED-CNN and MAP-NN,\nwe re-train these methods with the same dataset.\n3 https://www.aapm.org/GrandChallenge/LowDoseCT/\n4 https://scikit-image.org/\n6 Z.

The display window is [-160, 240]\nHU .\nFig 2 shows the results randomly selected from the testing dataset. As com-\npared to LDCT (Fig 2 (B)), NLM and all the DL-based methods can remove\nnoise to a certain extent, while our proposed TransCT is more close to NDCT.\nBy investigating the local region in Fig 3, we can see that the blood vessels (red\narrows) are not obvious with NLM in (Fig 3 (C)). RED-CNN and MAP-NN gen-\nerate, more or less, some additional light tissues (yellow arrow in (Fig 3 (D)))\nand shadows (green arrow in (Fig 3 (E))), respectively.\nQuantitative Analysis To quantitatively compare all the related methods,\nwe conducted 5-fold cross-validation for all methods on Mayo dataset and em-\nployed Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Structural Similarity (SSIM), and\nVisual Information Fidelity (VIF) [20] as image quality metrics. Among the\nthree metrics, RMSE and SSIM mainly focus on pixel-wise similarity, and VIF\nuses natural statistics models to evaluate psychovisual features of the human\nvisual system. From table 1, we can see that all the related methods improve\nthe image quality on all three metrics. To be speciﬁc, Red-CNN is superior to\nMAP-NN at the pixel-wise level while inferior to MAP-NN in terms of VIF. As\ncompared to LDCT, our TransCT can decrease RMSE by 40.5%, improve SSIM\nby 12.3%, and VIF by 93.7%. For clinical evaluation, limited by clinical ethics,\nwe evaluated all the methods on clinical CBCT images from a real pig head.\nTransCT 7\n(A) (B) (C)\n(D) (E) (F)\nFig. 3.The zoomed regions marked by the red box in Fig. 2 (A).

To evaluate the inﬂuence of\npiecewise reconstruction, we modiﬁed the proposed TransCT and removed the\npiecewise reconstruction. After the output of the third transformer decoder, we\nused a sub-pixel layer to directly reconstruct the noise-free high-resolution HF\ntexture, and then we added this HF texture and XL to obtain the ﬁnal LDCT\nimage. Speciﬁcally, we have removed six convolution layers, including the path of\ncontent extraction (XLc1 and XLc2 ) and four convolution layers in the ﬁnal two\nTable 1.Quantitative results (MEAN ±SDs) associated with diﬀerent methods.

Fig 4 (a) shows the RMSE value on the validation dataset at each\nepoch. We can see that in about the ﬁrst 20 epochs, the RMSE from modiﬁed\nTransCT decreases faster since its model scale is smaller than our TransCT, while\nthe convergence was inferior to our TransCT with piecewise reconstruction.\nOn the Inﬂuence of Model Size Generally, larger network size will lead to\nstronger neural network learning ability. In terms of each transformer encoder\nand decoder, which includes a two-layer feed-forward network, respectively, when\nthe dimension of the input sequence is ﬁxed, the dimension of the hidden layer\nin the feed-forward network will determine the network size. Here, we adjusted\nthe dimension of the hidden layer {c,2c,4c}to investigate the inﬂuence of model\nsize. From Fig 4 (b), we can see that the smaller the dimension of the hidden\nlayer is, the larger the ﬂuctuation of the convergence curve is, the larger the ﬁnal\nconvergent value will be. Therefore, we conclude that larger model results in a\nbetter performance. In this work, we set the dimension of the hidden layer in\nthe feed-forward network at 8c.\nAblation studies on Transformer Module and Dual-path Module To\ninvestigate the eﬀectiveness of the transformer module and dual-path mod-\nule, we conducted two additional experiments. First, we used a revised module\n(”Conv+3×ResNet blocks”) to replace the transformer module. We concate-\nnated XHf and the output from the fourth Conv layer (n128s2, before XLt ) and\nthen inputted it into the revised module. As for the dual-path module, we dis-\ncarded the HF path and inputted the XLc2 into 3 transformer encoders, whose\noutput will be combined with XLc1 and XLc2 in the piecewise reconstruction\nstage. The results on the validation dataset were shown in table 2, we can see\nthat our TransCT with transformer module and dual-path module can obtain\nbetter performance.\n4 Conclusion\nInspired by the internal similarity of the LDCT image, we present the ﬁrst\ntransformer-based neural network for LDCT, which can explore large-range de-\npendencies between LDCT pixels. To ease the impact of noise on high-frequency\nTransCT 9\nTable 2.Ablation studies on transformer module and dual-path module conducted on\nthe validation dataset.\nRMSE SSIM VIF\nw/o transformer module 22.62 ±2.068 0.927±0.013 0.13 ±0.023\nw/o dual-path module 21.711 ±1.997 0.931±0.012 0.14 ±0.025\nTransCT 21.199 ±2.054 0.933±0.012 0.144±0.025\ntexture recovery, we employ a transformer encoder to further excavate the low-\nfrequency part of the latent texture features and then use these texture features\nto restore the high-frequency features from noisy high-frequency parts of LDCT\nimage. The ﬁnal high-quality LDCT image can be piecewise reconstructed with\nthe combination of low-frequency content and high-frequency features. In the\nfuture, we will further explore the learning ability of TransCT and introduce\nself-supervised learning to lower the need for the training dataset.\nAcknowledgements.
