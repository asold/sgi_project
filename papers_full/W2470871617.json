  "abstract": "Fe3O4 nanoparticles with an average diameter of 10 nm were prepared and used to modify streamer characteristic of transformer oil. It was found that positive streamer propagation velocity in transformer oil-based Fe3O4 nanofluid is greatly reduced by 51% in comparison with that in pure oil. The evolution of streamer shape is also dramatically affected by the presence of nanoparticles, changing from a tree-like shape with sharp branches in pure oil to a bush-like structure with thicker and denser branches in nanofluid. The TSC results reveal that the modification of Fe3O4 nanoparticle can greatly increase the density of shallow trap and change space charge distribution in nanofluid by converting fast electrons into slow electrons via trapping and de-trapping process in shallow traps. These negative space charges induced by nanoparticles greatly alleviate the electric field distortion in front of the positive streamer tip and significantly hinder the propagation of positive streamer.",
