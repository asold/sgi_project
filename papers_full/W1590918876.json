Integration of video clips in teaching \nmaterials has recently attracted more attention in academic research.  \nThe outcomes of using supplementary videos are increasing student activity and \nefficiency of the teaching process. An i mportant issue is establishing a methodology of \nembedding video clips in multimedia teaching material in order to improv e the learning \nprocess (Kay, 2012). D istance learning and college course s where the students are \nworking individually on their projects after class are especially suitable for testing of \nnew methods aimed at improvement of students’ work. \nThe main motivation for testing the effects of video clip integration into multimedia \npresentation is that visual stimulation with a media application familiar to the student \npopulation can increase their eng agement. It is well known that Internet video traffic is \nconstantly increas ing its share of consumer Internet traffic. Social media application s \nsuch as Facebook, YouTube, blogs, and w ikis can be used as supplement al materials in \nthe teaching process (Burke, Snyder, & Rager, 2009). \nThe selection of appropriate video clips and methodology for their display within the \nteaching materials represents an  important issue for curriculum design, leading  to \npositive learning outcomes (McConville & Lane, 2006). The co gnitive theory of \nmultimedia learning shows that it is necessary to select relevant information and \norganize it into a verbal and pictorial model (Mayer, 2001). Using appropriate teaching \nmedia and methods to organize and present only relevant information may also increase \nthe efficiency of the self-learning process (Ruiji, 2012). Evaluating the effectiveness of \nthe use of teaching materials in video format in distance learning environments and the \nmeasuring of “viewer engagement” is important for improveme nt of the learning \nprocess (Stiubiener et al., 2012).  \nAn important aspect of the learning process is students’ satisfaction, especially in the \ncase of online learning (Roach & Lemasters, 2006). Considering this theory, students ’ \nsatisfaction, as an important outcome of a multimedia learning process, should be \nanalyzed more closely. The quality of student satisfaction and experience depend s on \nthe method of usage of video clips in designing linear educational video materials. \nTherefore, the quality of the learning process may be described  also with quality of \nexperience (QoE). \n     \nUsing Supplementary Video in Multimedia Instruction as a Teaching Tool to Increase Efficiency of Learning \nand Quality of Experience \nLjubojevic, Vaskovic, Stankovic, and Vaskovic \n \nVol 15 | No 3  July/14 \n  \n      277 \nIn this paper, the efficiency of learning and quality of e xperience for different types of \nvideo clips and methods for integration in multimedia lecture presentation s are \nanalyzed. \nVideo as a Factor of Influence in Motivation, Satisfaction, and \nSuccessful Learning \nModern teaching process es are based on the use of multimedia teaching materials and \nthe Internet. The cognitive theory of multimedia learning represents a foundation for \nthe implementation of multimedia educational content presentation. This theory \nexplains the significance of the modality principle in the learning process, as shown in \nFigure 1. \nIn order to efficiently process multimedia information it is necessary to select relevant \ninformation and organize it into a verbal and pictorial model. Processing the \ninformation is performed in two channels after receiving the auditory and visual \ninformation that appears  in the working memory as verbal and pictorial information \nmodels. A r ational use of resources i s very important, so design of multimedia \npresentation is a crucial factor for the learning process outcome (Mayer, 2001 ; Moreno \n& Mayer, 1999). \n \nFigure 1. The cognitive theory of multimedia learning (Mayer, 2001). \n \nCognitive load theory, educational research, and instructional design are closely related , \nthus they should be analyzed together to achieve  the best learning results (De Jong, \n2010). Previous research also shows that the efficiency of the learning process is closel y \nrelated to interaction between motivational and cognitive variables (Valle et al ., 2003). \nMultimedia technology has been exploited often for improving teaching and learning. \nVideos are a tool for engaging the verbal (linguistic), visual (spatial) , and mu sical \n(rhythmic) intelligenc e of the student in  the learning process, especially in  the self-\nlearning process (Gardner, 2000). Positive effects of features of video clips (multi -\nsensory, dynamic and capable of engaging the viewer's attention) were often us ed in \nengineering education (Marques , 2012). \n     \nUsing Supplementary Video in Multimedia Instruction as a Teaching Tool to Increase Efficiency of Learning \nand Quality of Experience \nLjubojevic, Vaskovic, Stankovic, and Vaskovic \n \nVol 15 | No 3  July/14 \n  \n      278 \nDifferent methods of embedding and different context s of supplementary video content \ncan be used in the teaching process. Teachers are using multimedia presentation \nprepared for the course as well as additional, supplementary videos. S upplementary \nvideos may have different contexts. Two of them are important for this research: The \nfirst is that they are closely related to the presented lecture topic and the second context \nis entertainment used for capturing the attention and interest of the students. Methods \nfor integration and use of different context s of supplementary videos in multimedia \neducation materials are important task s for research aiming to improve the learning \nprocess. \nIn this research, the purpose o f supplementary video material use is to increase \nstudent’s attention on the topic of the lecture. In order to increase learning quality, two \nimportant goals should be achieved : reducing cognitive load and increasing student's \nattention. Beside s educational and entertainment content , it is possible to use \ncommercial content as supplementary video . Although the commercial content may \ncontribute to reducing the cognitive load of the student, this type of context potentially \nmay take away students’  attention f rom the topic of the lecture and focus it on the \ncommercial content. Due to that, supplementary videos with commercial content ha ve \nbeen less relevant to this research than educational and entertainment content. In \nfuture research, the influence of supplem entary videos with commercial content on  \nstudents’ attention should be investigated. \nPrevious research explored the results of the use of videos as an educational tool (Bravo \net al ., 2011). In this study the authors used educational videos with a  duration of \napproximately four minutes. They used a teaching platform based on Moodle and \nYouTube channels for reproduction. The study showed that streaming videos used as \nsupporting material for learning had a positive effect upon students’ perception \nregarding t he enhancement of their learning motivation. The study emphasized that \nproper definition of content and amount of information delivered through supplement al \nvideo is an important task to solve. Durations of videos and  methodologies of displaying \nthem influence the effectiveness of learning and student satisfaction. An i mportant \nresult of this research is that streaming supplement al videos improve students’ ability to \nlearn in an autonomous way.  \nHsin and Cigas (2013) used short videos to enhance student sat isfaction and motivation \nfor an online introductory course in computer science/mathematics. They achieved a \nsignificantly higher percentage of involved students and their average grades increased. \nAnother method to engage and to motivate students is showin g entertainment videos \n(Steffes & Duverger, 2012). As Steffes and Duverger reported, showing supplementary \nvideos within an  entertainment context at the beginning of the class can be used to \nincrease the positive mood of the students. Both previous studies , Bravo et al. (2011)  \nand Steffes and Duverger (2012), emphasize the importance of the proper design of \nsupplementary video content and the methodology of displaying video to students.  \n     \nUsing Supplementary Video in Multimedia Instruction as a Teaching Tool to Increase Efficiency of Learning \nand Quality of Experience \nLjubojevic, Vaskovic, Stankovic, and Vaskovic \n \nVol 15 | No 3  July/14 \n  \n      279 \nDonkor (2011) showed that use of video -based instructional materials fo r teaching \npractical skills at a distance also appears promising. \nOne of the key questions is the q uality of experience (QoE) achieved with the presented \nmultimedia materials. This problem is more interesting if the different contexts of the \nvideo content are merged. In the research presented in Le Callet et al . (2012), the \nauthors defined experience as an individual’s stream of perception and interpretation of \none or multiple events. On the other hand, quality is defined as an outcome of an \nindividual’s comparison and judgment process, which includes perception, reflection \nabout the perception, and description of the outcome.  \nFinally, a working definition of quality of experience is:  \nQuality of Experience (QoE) is the degree of delight or \nannoyance of the  user of an application or service. It \nresults from the fulfillment of his or her expectations \nwith respect to the utility and/or enjoyment of the \napplication or service in the light of the user’ s \npersonality and current state. (Le Callet et al., 2012)  \nThe definition of quality of e xperience gives a framework for analyzing the efficiency of \ndelivery of video content using the Internet. Ljubojevic et al.  (2013) analyzed l inear \ninternet video advertising efficiency using QoE m ethods. Another important task i s the \ninfluence of the delivery of supplementary video used in the  teaching process on \nstudents’ quality of experience. \nTherefore, students’ quality of experience and learning outcome may depend on the \ncontext of inserted supplementary videos and the meth od for embedding video into \nteaching material. \n \nMethod \nPrevious research findings show ed that segmentation of multimedia teaching materials \nenables easier processing of complex information by reducing high cognitive load. \nStudents with a low level of prior  knowledge learn ed more efficiently if segmented \nmaterial was presented instead of continuous material (Spanjers et al ., 2011). This \nfinding is especially important for novices in the learning process.  \nIn our study, the participants in the experiment were students who attended  the class \nfor the first time and had  a lower level of prior knowledge. Therefore, the efficiency of \ndifferent methods of segmentation of multimedia teaching material in learning for \nnovices was analyzed. Due to the fact that video wi th different video content type s is \ninserted in multimedia learning materials, supplementary videos have a different \n     \nUsing Supplementary Video in Multimedia Instruction as a Teaching Tool to Increase Efficiency of Learning \nand Quality of Experience \nLjubojevic, Vaskovic, Stankovic, and Vaskovic \n \nVol 15 | No 3  July/14 \n  \n      280 \ninfluence on students’ motivation and QoE. The e fficiency of different methods for \nintegrating those videos should be investigated in detail. \nThe teacher has to decide how he wants to use video clips, where and when to embed \nthem into multimedia learning material (Berk, 2009). Previous research described the \neffectiveness of videos embedded in multimedia teaching materials and their influence \non the improvement of teaching (Pryor & Bitter, 2008 ; Borko et al. , 2008). This choice \nhas a strong influence on  the students’ QoE and the efficiency of the learning process. \nThe instructional design model is also important in developing teaching skills  (Isman et \nal., 2012). In order to analyze the multimedia learning quality process and level of \nstudent motivation for learning, especially if supplementary video streaming was used \nwithin the  lecture, the quality of experience assessment should be used. \nTesting Methodology \nImportant aspects of this study are principles for designing multimedia teaching content \nand present ing supplementary videos. A m ethod for assessment of the efficiency of \nlearning and student’s QoE was also proposed. \nIn this study two inf luence factors in motivation and efficiency of learning were tested: \nthe context of inserted supplementary video and position of the embedded  videos into \nteaching material.  \nTwo contexts of videos were used: the entertainment context of the video and the \neducational context similar to a  lecture. Methods for embedding the videos we re \nanalyzed in the sense of the position of the supplementary video regarding the main \nmultimedia teaching material. Three possible methods were tested: displaying \nsupplementary videos before, in the middle, and after the lecture.  \nIn order to simulate spatial and temporal separation between the students and the \nprofessor (main characteristic of distance learning and the self-learning process), \nmultimedia materials created for the experiment were presented to the student s in a \nmultimedia classroom. Two assistant s also assisted as technical support during the \nlecture presentation.  \nEach of the applied methods for embedding supplementary videos was separately \ntested. After the lecture presentation, using one of the  methods, participants had a 60 \nminute break and then the testing was performed. Students answered 20 questions \nrelated to the lesson that was presented. By analyzing the given testing results, the \nefficiency of different methods for inserting supplementary video may be compared. \nA subjective assessment of the user’s quality of experience was also conducted. The \ntesting was performed according to the subjective video quality assessment methods for \nmultimedia applications descri bed by Recommendation ITU -T P.910 (ITU -T, 1999). \nDuring the testing, a single test condition (one multimedia education content with \n     \nUsing Supplementary Video in Multimedia Instruction as a Teaching Tool to Increase Efficiency of Learning \nand Quality of Experience \nLjubojevic, Vaskovic, Stankovic, and Vaskovic \n \nVol 15 | No 3  July/14 \n  \n      281 \nsupplementary video) was presented to students once  only. Then t hey gave a  quality \nrating on an Absolute Category Rating (AC R) scale. By use of the previously described \nmethodology, the subjective assessment of the quality of experience (QoE) was \nconducted immediately after the presentation of the teaching materials.  \nIn order to assess the subjective perception of the method for the presentation of lecture \ncontent, participants answered carefully chosen questions, listed in Table 1. \nTable 1 \nAssessment Questions \nNo. Question \n1 Were the directions for participating in experiment sufficient?  \n2 Did you find the quality of presenting a lecture sufficient? \n3 Did you think video and audio quality of supplementary video \nstream was good? \n4 Were you able to maintain the attention level during the session?  \n5 Do you think that you correctly answered the questions? \n6 Was it easy to answer the questions? \n \nAccording to Recommendation ITU -T P.910 and assessment  and rating of the quality of \nexperience, a five level mean opinion s core (MOS) scale was  used as presented in Table \n2. \nTable 2 \nScale for Quality of Experience Rating and Gradation \nMean opinion score (MOS) Explanation \n5 Excellent \n4 Good \n3 Fair \n2 Poor \n1 Bad \n \nThis research has several limitations, which are related to deeper analysis that need s a \nlonger period of testing. The performed experiment should be applied for a whole \nsemester with the participation of a number of different classes of students. Several \ndifferent curriculums should be used in research for a deeper analysis and  an efficient \ncomparison of results. Those limitations should be overcome in future research.  \n \n \n \n     \nUsing Supplementary Video in Multimedia Instruction as a Teaching Tool to Increase Efficiency of Learning \nand Quality of Experience \nLjubojevic, Vaskovic, Stankovic, and Vaskovic \n \nVol 15 | No 3  July/14 \n  \n      282 \nParticipants and Testing Environment \nThe research was performed at a university located in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The \nmultimedia classroom is well- equipped for advanced multimedia presentations and \nhigh speed internet access. \nThe participants were 46 undergraduate students who attended  the same academic \ncourse. During the preparation of the experiment students were informed about the \ntesting procedure. In order to motivate students for serious participation they were \ninformed that they would receive extra cre dits for their course grade based on their \nindividual performance. Participants filled in questionnaires regarding personal data, \nprior experience relat ed to multimedia learning methods , and prior knowledge about  \nthe topics covered in the multimedia testing materials. \nAnalysis of collected data showed that participants had a  similar level of prior \nknowledge about the multimedia learning and topics that were  presented in the \nmultimedia teaching materials. Therefore, it may be assumed that there was \nhomogeneity in learners ’ prior knowledge and skills related to the teaching process. \nDemographic data showed that out of 46 participants, 28 were male and 18 were female \nwith the average age under 22 (93%). \nDesign of the Testing of Multimedia Learning Material \nThe multimedia teaching material was designed for the purpose of this research using \ntopics defined in the course curriculum. T he t eaching material consist ed of two parts: \nthe main multimedia educational material and the supplementary videos. The main \nmultimedia education material was created using video lectures recorded by using a \nprofessional video camera and PowerPoint presentations. Video lectures and \nPowerPoint presentations were merged so the text of the P owerPoint presentation, \naudio information and eff ect of occasional appearance of the instructor on the screen \nwere used to achieve better knowledge transfer.  \nSupplementary videos that were used were downloaded from YouTube keeping in mind \nusers’ interests and the number of views. Video clips were insert ed and presented \nbefore, in the middle , and after the main multimedia educational material. The method \nof integrating two videos by displaying only one of them on the screen, if the user has no \ncontrol over the presented video, may be described as a linear method of multimedia \npresentation. The supplementary videos have two contexts. The f irst context is \nentertainment and the second one is closely related to the lecture.  \nFor designing one dataset of teaching material one main multimedia educational \nmaterial content and two videos with previously described contexts (entertainment and \neducational) were used. From the aspect of usage of supplementary video, three types of \nmultimedia test material were created: \n     \nUsing Supplementary Video in Multimedia Instruction as a Teaching Tool to Increase Efficiency of Learning \nand Quality of Experience \nLjubojevic, Vaskovic, Stankovic, and Vaskovic \n \nVol 15 | No 3  July/14 \n  \n      283 \n• Supplementary videos were not used at all and the lecture was presented \ncontinuously;  \n• Supplementary video with the entertainment context was used;  \n• Supplementary video with the educational context closely related to the lecture \ntopic was used. \nIn order to test the influence of the position of supplementa ry video within the \nmultimedia presentation, the video was displayed at the beginning, in the middle , and at \nthe end of the main multimedia educational material , as shown in Figure 2. Therefore, \nfor each type of multimedia materials three different subtypes were created. \n \nFigure 2. Principle of inserting the supplementary video in lecture presentation.  \n \nAccording to the proposed methodology the following types of multimedia teaching \nmaterials were created: \n• main multimedia without supplementary video and ap plication of  continual \npresentation of lecture (M_nv); \n• main multimedia with educational supplementary video inserted at the \nbeginning (M_ed 1), middle (M_ed 2) , and at the end of the presentation \n(M_ed 3); \n• main multimedia with entertainment supplementary v ideo inserted at the \nbeginning (M_ent 1), middle (M_ent 2) , and at the end of the presentation \n(M_ent 3). \nThe influence of the segmentation method by inserting supplementary video within the \npresentation of the lecture content was analyzed comparing the previously described \nmethods of lecture presentation. \n     \nUsing Supplementary Video in Multimedia Instruction as a Teaching Tool to Increase Efficiency of Learning \nand Quality of Experience \nLjubojevic, Vaskovic, Stankovic, and Vaskovic \n \nVol 15 | No 3  July/14 \n  \n      284 \nResults \nFor every type of multimedia education material which was created for this research , the \nlevel of acquired knowledge and student's quality of experience were tested. In order to \ndescribe key research variables, two research instruments were used. Test questions and \nresults illustrated with average number of correct answers, median value , and standard \ndeviation were used to measure the level of the acquired knowledge and to describe the \ntesting proc edure. The assessment of students ’ quality of experience was performed \nusing a MOS scale with the five levels. \nIf the presentation of the lecture is continuous, without inserting supplementary videos, \nwhich is considered as a method that provides acquiring  a reference level of knowledge, \ntwo remaining methods may describe possible improvements achieved by inserting \ndifferent videos.  \nTested methods of embedding the supplementary videos were: \n• main multimedia without supplementary video using continual lectur e \npresentation (M_nv); \n• main multimedia with educational supplementary video inserted at the \nbeginning (M_ed 1); \n• main multimedia with educational supplementary video inserted in the middle \n(M_ed 2); \n• main multimedia with educational supplementary video inser ted at the end of \nthe presentation (M_ed 3); \n• main multimedia with entertainment supplementary video inserted at the \nbeginning (M_ent 1); \n• main multimedia with entertainment supplementary video inserted in the \nmiddle (M_ent 2); \n• main multimedia with entertain ment supplementary video inserted at the end \nof the presentation (M_ent 3). \nThe results of testing the acquired knowledge and student's quality of experience are \nanalyzed and presented in Table 3 and Table 4, respectively.  In Table 3, the average \nnumber of  correct answers for every tested method of embedding and displaying \nsupplementary videos is presented. \n \n \n     \nUsing Supplementary Video in Multimedia Instruction as a Teaching Tool to Increase Efficiency of Learning \nand Quality of Experience \nLjubojevic, Vaskovic, Stankovic, and Vaskovic \n \nVol 15 | No 3  July/14 \n  \n      285 \nTable 3 \nResults of Testing of Acquired Knowledge \n  Methods of embedding and displaying supplementary video \nStatistical \nmeasure  M_nv M_ed 1 M_ed 2 M_ed 3 M_ent 1 M_ent 2 M_ent 3 \nAV 12.22 13.78 15.50 12.85 13.13 13.76 12.33 \nMed 12.00 14.00 15.00 12.00 13.00 14.00 12.00 \nStd 3.11 2.51 2.29 2.52 2.00 2.06 2.44 \nAV - Average number of correct answers, Med - Median value, Std - Standard deviation \n \nThe least number of correct answers was in the case of continual presentation of lecture \ncontent. It illustrates that segmentation by inserting video clips may increase memory \nand better understanding in the learning process. Therefore, the results showed that  \nmethods based on the insertion of videos in multimedia teaching materials gave a \nhigher number of correct answers regardless of the position or the context of \nsupplementary videos.  \nThe presented results indicate that a more efficient method for increasin g the students ’ \nparticipation and deeper learning is to display the educational context of supplementary \nvideo clips instead of inserting entertainment videos.  \nThe experimental results also showed that the biggest influence on efficiency of learning \nis the method that is based on inserting videos in the middle of the lecture presentation. \nThe results were the same for both contexts of the supplementary videos. In the case of \ninserting the videos in the middle, the data were closest to the mean and the standard \ndeviation was smallest, so the answers were  fairly uniform. It confirmed the superiority \nof inserting video clips in the middle of the lecture.  \nThe results of knowledge testing (average number of correct answers) for different \nmethods of inserting supplementary video clips are illustrated in Figure 3. \n \n     \nUsing Supplementary Video in Multimedia Instruction as a Teaching Tool to Increase Efficiency of Learning \nand Quality of Experience \nLjubojevic, Vaskovic, Stankovic, and Vaskovic \n \nVol 15 | No 3  July/14 \n  \n      286 \n \nFigure 3.

Female students \nwere a little more satisfied if sup plementary video material was used within the lecture \npresentation. \n \nConclusion \nThis research aims to present the positive effects of the use of videos as a supplementary \nteaching tool. S tudents’ motivation and efficiency of learning may be increased if \nsupplementary videos are used.  \nThe analysis of methods for inserting video clips regarding different positions and the \ncontext of supplementary content shows that the methodology of inserting the \nsupplementary videos is very important for improvement of teaching. \nThe positive effects of segmentation as an instructional method of teaching was \nconfirmed with experimental results. Students acquired a higher level of knowledge if \nthe lecture was presented in segments separated with videos, regardless of the cont ext of \nthe video content. \nResearch also demonstrated the importance of adequate design and presentation of \nmultimedia teaching materials. Different context s of use of supplementary video \ncontent in teaching showed that better efficiency is achieved if the educational content \ncongruent with the lecture has been displayed. Entertainment video was not as efficient \nas educational, but it can be used to engage and motivate students ’ learning. \n     \nUsing Supplementary Video in Multimedia Instruction as a Teaching Tool to Increase Efficiency of Learning \nand Quality of Experience \nLjubojevic, Vaskovic, Stankovic, and Vaskovic \n \nVol 15 | No 3  July/14 \n  \n      288 \nThe position of inserted video has an important role in increasing efficiency of learning. \nThe entertainment video at the beginning of the lecture motivated  students towards \nlearning, so testing results were  better for that  method than if a lecture without videos \nwas used. A b etter effect was achieved when educational video content was used. This \nresearch showed that the most efficient method of use of supplementary video is \nintegration of educational video content in the middle of the lecture.  \nPositive feedback from students about enhancement of their learning motivation an d \nresults of performed testing confirmed positive effects of the use of videos in teaching. \nSubjective assessment of quality of experience achieved by the use of supplementary \nvideo in teaching confirmed that the educational video inserted in the middle of  the \nlecture may increase efficiency of learning. The results indicate that female students are \nmore interested than male students to use  learning material enriched by supplementary \nvideos. \nIn further research we are planning to investigate different aspec ts of integrati ng video \ncontent into a presentation (duration of video, usage of video streaming, interactive \nvideo content, etc.). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \nUsing Supplementary Video in Multimedia Instruction as a Teaching Tool to Increase Efficiency of Learning \nand Quality of Experience \nLjubojevic, Vaskovic, Stankovic, and Vaskovic \n \nVol 15 | No 3  July/14 \n  \n      289 \nReferences \nBerk, R.
