  "abstract": "In recent years, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) automatic target recognition (ATR) has been widely used in both military and civilian fields. Due to the sensitivity of SAR images to the observation azimuth, the multi-aspect SAR image sequence contains more information for recognition than a single-aspect one. Nowadays, multi-aspect SAR target recognition methods mainly use recurrent neural networks (RNN), which rely on the order between images and thus suffer from information loss. At the same time, the training of the deep learning model also requires a lot of training data, but multi-aspect SAR images are expensive to obtain. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-aspect SAR recognition method based on self-attention, which is used to find the correlation between the semantic information of images. Simultaneously, in order to improve the anti-noise ability of the proposed method and reduce the dependence on a large amount of data, the convolutional autoencoder (CAE) used to pretrain the feature extraction part of the method is designed. The experimental results using the MSTAR dataset show that the proposed multi-aspect SAR target recognition method is superior in various working conditions, performs well with few samples and also has a strong ability of anti-noise.",
