INTRODUCTION\nGrafting materials are widely used for pre and peri-implant\nbone augmentation procedures from more than 35 years [ 1, 2].\nThe  most  commonly  used  graft  materials  are  from  animal\norigin, synthetic or human. In these cases, bone regeneration\nstimulation derives from the host organism and never from the\ndonor,  slowing  or  decreasing  the  regenerative  potential.\nAutogenous bone graft is considered the gold standard for the\n*  Address  correspondence  to  this  author  at  the  Biomaterial  Clinical  and\nHistological Research Association; Private Practice, Via Galilei 8, 65122 Pescara,\nItaly; Tel: +390857933050; Fax: +390857933050;\nE-mail: dottmarcoberardini@gmail.com\nrepair of alveolar bone defects, but it is associated with donor\ncomplications and morbidity and also suffers from a limited\nsupply.\nPermanent teeth graft has been proposed since 1967, when\nYeomans and Urist [ 3] and Bang and Urist [ 4] demonstrated\nosteoinduction properties of autogenous demineralized dentin\nmatrix;  some  years  later,  Kawai  and  Urist  partially  purified\nbone morphogenetic proteins of bovine dentin matrix [5].\nThe  idea  to  use  autogenous  tooth  as  bone  substitute  in\ngrafting procedure started from similar chemical composition\nbetween bone and dentin. Both of them consist, in fact, of 18%\ncollagen, 2% proteins, 70% inorganic portion (hydroxyapatite),\nThe Tooth Transformer The Open Dentistry Journal, 2019, Volume 13   7\nand 10% of fluids. Both tooth and alveolar bone are derived\nfrom  neural  crest  cells  and  are  made  up  of  the  same  type  I\ncollagen.\nIn 1991, Bessho et al . [ 6], demonstrated the presence of\nBone  Morphogenetic  Proteins  (BMPs)  from  human  dentin\nmatrix. Therefore, both bone and dentin matrix is a repository\nfor  growth  factors,  such  as  Bone  Morphogenetic  Proteins\n(BMPs) and basic fibroblast growth factor. It was also reported\nthat the demineralized human dentin matrix was able to induce\nbone  and  cartilage  formation  in  mouse  muscles  with  the\nconcomitant presence of bone-forming cells (osteoblasts) [ 7].\nThe consistent number of recent studies [ 8, 9] existing in this\ntopic  testifies  the  scientific  increasing  interest  about  this\npossibility  for  grafting  procedures.\nThe demineralized dentin matrix may represent an efficient\nreserve of BMPs because highly soluble BMPs do not exert\nosteoinductive  effects  when  used  alone.  Bioactive  Growth\nFactors (GFs), such as Transforming Growth Factor-B (TGF-\nB) and bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs), which are known\nto be present in and released from dentin, are involved in bone\nrepairing processes [10].\nThe preparation technique to transform autologous teeth in\nsuitable grafting material represents the key step of the whole\nprocedure. It is fundamental to preserve the organic autologous\ncomponents  to  stimulate  bone  progenitor  cells,  remove  any\ncontaminants to avoid inflammatory or infective reactions, and\nprepare the inorganic part to be easily colonized by osteoblasts.\nThe demineralization process is required for freeing the various\ngrowth  factors  and  proteins,  since  the  release  of  the  growth\nfactors is sometimes blocked by the presence of hydroxyapatite\ncrystals  [11].  Through  the  reduction  of  the  mineral  phase,\ndemineralization supports the release of such growth factors\nfrom the tooth matrix [12].\nAt present, demineralized autogenous dentin is available in\ntwo  forms,  granules  and  block  [ 13].  Some  authors  [ 14]\ntheorized  that  the  geometry  and  granules  size  assume  a\nfundamental  importance  in  terms  of  bone  regeneration  pro-\nperties. Recently, Koga et al . [ 15], recommended the use of\n1000  μm  particles  and  a  partial  demineralization  with  2%\nHNO3.\nThere are some devices, on the market, that allow to grind\nthe  tooth  of  the  patient  to  produce  dentin  granules.  These\ndevices  need  a  manual  control  by  the  clinicians  in  grinding\nprocess without any control in particles size. Furthermore, also\nthe  chemical  treatment  to  obtain  tooth  decontamination  and\ndemineralization  is  entrusted  to  the  operator's  manual  skills\n[16].\nRecently,  an  innovative  medical  device  (TT  TOOTH\nTRANSFORMER SRL, Via Washington, 59 - Milan, Italy) to\nobtain  suitable  tooth  graft  materials  starting  from  the  whole\ntooth of the patient was introduced to the market. All grinding\nand  demineralizing  processes  are  completely  automated\nwithout  any  human  possibility  of  error.  According  to  the\nmanufacturer, this new device represents an advanced system\nin the area of tissue engineering that can process and transform\nextracted tooth into useful bone graft material in a short time.\nThe  autogenous  genetic  content  guarantees  absolute  com-\npatibility  with  the  recipient  site  and  most  importantly,  the\ncontent of BMP-2 (Bone Morphogenic Proteins that stimulate\nbone growth), found by some authors in a previously published\nin  vitro  investigation  [ 17],  could  guarantees  high  oste-\noinduction.\nThis  autologous  tooth  graft  should  be  able  to  stimulate\nadhesion,  proliferation  and  cellular  differentiation  and  to\npromote the bone regeneration. The high wettability allows the\nease of handling. The tooth like a bone, is made of collagen\ntype 1 and minerals of Hydroxyapatite (HA). The tooth trans-\nformer  reduces  the  crystallinity  of  the  HA,  eliminates  the\nbacteria  and  transforms  the  dentin  into  an  autologous  graft\nmaterial. In  vitro  studies  demonstrated  the  presence  and  the\nfreeing  of  BMP-2  from  tooth  and  the  elevated  biocompa-\ntibility  of  the  dentin  after  treatment  [18].\nThe present paper aims to present clinical and histological\noutcomes of 11 consecutive case of socket preservation and 4\ncases of sinus lift using innovative autologous tooth grafting\nprocedure.\n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS\nThe present case series included 15 patients (7 male and 8\nfemale), age ranged between 22 to 64 years old. All patients\nwere in good health conditions and were nonsmokers. In 11\ncases, the patients needed guided bone regeneration procedures\nwhile  in  other  4  cases,  patients  asked  for  maxillary  sinus\nelevation.  An  informed  and  written  consent  to  the  surgical\ntreatment was obtained from each subject. The approval of the\nethical committee was not needed because it is a case series\nanalysis without any experimental material or procedures (the\ndevice is present in the market). The patients were advised that\nthe  bone  regeneration  procedures  would  be  made  using\nautologous  tooth  as  regenerative  material  and  each  patient\ndeclared to understand the benefits of using an autologous bone\nregeneration material.\nIn  each  case,  the  patient  underwent  3D  radiological\nanalysis (Fig. 1) before proceeding to tooth extraction and/or\nregeneration  procedures.  Three  to  four  days  before  surgery,\npatients  were  prepared  with  an  oral  hygiene  session  and\nreceived  a  reinforcing  oral  hygiene  instruction  to  have  an\nappropriate  cleanliness  by  means  of  electric-toothbrush.\nTwenty-four hours before surgery, antibiotic prophylaxis was\nstarted (amoxicillin 1g twice a day for 6 days).\nIn cases in which also tooth extractions were planned (9\npatients out 11), patients underwent hopeless tooth extraction\nsome  minutes  before  starting  bone  regenerative  procedures\nwhile in the remaining two cases deciduous or wisdom teeth,\nconserved by the patient over the years, were used.\nIn all cases, extracted teeth were carefully cleaned and any\nforeign materials were removed including calculus, restorations\nand  endodontic  filling  materials  before  its  insertion  in  the\ndevice  (Fig.  2).  Cementum  was  not  removed.\nIn particular, the tooth of the patient was treated for:\nCleaning  of  residual  calculus  using  piezoelectric\ninstrument;\n8   The Open Dentistry Journal, 2019, Volume 13 Minetti et al.\nCleaning the root surface using diamond burs;\nRemoving\n any filling materials (guttapercha, compo-\nsite, etc.)\nFinally,\n it  was  cut  in  small  pieces  to  facilitate  the\nmilling process.\nSubsequently,\n the tooth was placed inside the mill. A small\nbox containing disposable liquids was inserted in the device in\nits  correct  position  (indicated  by  arrows).  According  to  the\nmanufacturer, these solutions guarantee maximum release of\nBMP-2 and collagen as well as a decontamination of the root.\nWhen all the components were inserted and the cover of the\nmachine was closed, the device was started using the general\nswitch  button.  Demineralized  dentin  graft  was  ready  in  25\nminutes  to  be  placed  in  the  patient’s  mouth  (TT  TOOTH\nTRANSFORMER SRL, Via Washington, 59 - Milan, Italy).\nIn all cases, the graft was covered by a resorbable porcine\npericardium membrane (BEGO Implant Systems GmbH & Co.\nKG, Wilhelm-Herbst-Straße, Bremen, Germany) (Fig. 3). An\nimmediate  post-operative  radiological  check  was  performed\n(Fig. 4). Each patient underwent clinical examination after 10\nand  30  days  (Fig.  5)  and  (Fig.  6)  in  order  to  evaluate  the\nhealing process.\nCBCT  scans  were  performed  before  grafting  procedures\nand after 6 months of healing (Fig. 7) in order to evaluate the\nquality and quantity of the newly formed bone that filled the\ndefect. A clinical examination was performed during the re-\nentry  surgery  after  6  months  (Fig.  8)  for  implant  insertion\nprocedures (Fig. 9). Implants follow-up included a radiological\nexaminations\n after 4 months (Fig. 10), at final crown delivery\nand every 6 months.\nA total of 19 titanium dental implants were inserted during\nthe  surgical  re-entry  (6  months).The  mean  follow  up  period\nwas 12 months.\n3. RESULTS\nIn  all  cases,  after  6  months  of  healing,  the  defects  were\ncompletely  filled  by  newly  formed  bone.  All  cases  showed\ncomplete bone filling by clinical and radiographs observation.\nSurgical data and radiological measurements for each patient\nare summarized in Table 1. The newly formed tissue, observed\nduring the surgical re-entry, had a compactness similar to the\nmedium-density bone. The presence of graft particles or grains\nin sub mucous connective tissues was not recorded. No graft\nparticles  or  grains  were  visible  in  the  regenerated  bone\nstructure that appeared homogeneous and uniform. A D2-D3\nbone density was detected during implant drilling procedures.\nAll inserted implants reached high values of primary stability.\nIn all cases, after 18 of 19 implants were inserted, complete\nosseointegration after proper healing period was achieved. 1\nimplant failed, and non osseointegration was detected during\nthe second implant stage surgery. After the follow-up period of\n12 months, hard and soft tissues were stable. The healing of\nsoft tissues after grafting procedures was particularly free of\ncomplications. Even in cases where the surgical wound had not\nbeen closed by first intention, complete defect coverage was\nobserved within 10-15 days without complications or painful\nsymptoms.\nFig. (1). Hopeless first lower left molar (left side). The cone bean scans clearly showed the loss of vestibular cortex due to radicular fracture (right\nside).\nFig. (2). Atraumatic extraction of first left lower molar (left side). Any filling materials was removed using diamond and steel burs. The tooth was\ncleaned from residual calculus using piezoelectric instruments. Finally, it was cut in small pieces to facilitate the milling process. Tooth pieces were\ninserted in the machine and the device was started using the general switch button. Demineralized dentin graft was ready in 30-45 minutes to be\nplaced in the patient’s mouth (right side). The particles size ranged between 0,4 and 0,8 mm.\n\nThe Tooth Transformer The Open Dentistry Journal, 2019, Volume 13   9\nFig. (3).

DISCUSSION\nThe\n ideal  grafting  material  should  provide  scaffolds  for\nbone  regeneration  (osteoconduction)  and,  at  the  same  time,\nshould promote the recruitment of bone forming cells (such as\npreosteoblasts)  and  induce  new  bone  formation\n(osteoinduction)  [19].\nAutologous  bone  graft  has  been  considered  the  gold\nstandard  in  bone  regeneration  procedures  but  donor  site\nmorbidity, pain, and prolonged hospitalization (in case of extra\noral  donor  sites)  have  prompted  the  search  for  bone  graft\nsubstitutes  [20].  Too  fast  reabsorption  rate  has  also  been\nreported  for  autologous  bone  graft.\nXenograft materials have been used for many years with\nsuccess  [ 21],  in  various  fields  of  oral  bone  regeneration\nprocedures,  often  in  association  with  dental  implants.  Many\nstudies [22, 23] demonstrated that these regeneration materials\nare  space  maintaining  and  efficient  scaffolds  [ 24]  for\nosteogenetic cells migration but they did not offer any osteo-\ninduction  properties.  The  chemical  or  physical  processes  to\neliminate any organic residuals, which all xenograft materials\nare used, destroyed all proteins that are fundamental in bone\nregeneration  promotion.  Other  authors  reported  [ 25]  that\nallografts  show  faster  turnover  and  a  quicker  decrease  in\nbiological  action  than  xenografts.\nOn  the  other  hand,  many  studies  demonstrated  that\ndemineralized tooth graft is able to maintain the autogenous\ngrowth  factors  (such  as  osteopontin,  dentin  sialoprotein  and\nBMP)  and,  for  this  reason,  could  induce  bone  formation\n(osteoinduction).\nIn fact, dentoalveolar ankylosis with osseous replacement\nis often seen after replantation of avulsed teeth and this exact\nmechanism  could  explain  the  osteoinductive  properties  of\ndemineralized  dentin  matrixare  that  acts  as  a  slow-releasing\ncarrier of Bone Morphogenic Proteins (BMP) [ 26] and it was\nobserved that tooth graft material produced a similar amount of\nnew bone compared to autogenous bone graft (iliac crest) [27].\nGrowth factors, such as Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF),\nBone  Morphogenetic  Protein-2  (BMP-2)  and  Transforming\nGrowth Factor (TGF-β) are preserved over the time; in fact,\nthey were extracted from archaeological compact human bone\nand  tooth  dentin  dating  from  the  late  pre-ceramic  pottery\nNeolithic  and  the  early  Middle  Ages  [28].\nPrevious  authors  [ 29]  used  autogenous  demineralized\ndentin  matrix  on  dental  socket  wound  healing  process  in\nhumans  and  they  reported  that  dentin  matrix  gradually\ndisappeared  from  the  dental  socket  during  the  course  of  the\nrepair  process,  suggesting  its  resorption  during  the  bone\nremodeling  process.\nIn the 2014 [30] tooth bone graft was considered as a good\nalternative\n to  a  heterologous  bone  graft  when  extraction  is\nnecessary prior to the surgery and two years later, in 2016, a\ncase series was published showing successful subsistence of\nthe  cortico-cancellous  bone  volume  using  with  an  average\nfollow-up  of  5  years  .\nA recent literature review [ 31] identified 108 studies about\nautogenous teeth used for bone grafting and selected 6 among\nthem. The authors reported an implant survival rate of 97.7%\nand  found  that  the  dehiscence  of  the  wound  was  a  frequent\ncomplication. Another animal study [32] showed accelerated\nbone healing in defects treated by autogenous demineralized\ndentin  matrix  and  PTFE  membrane  in  respect  with  PTFE\nmembrane  alone.\nClinical studies [33] on Guided Bone Regeneration (GBR),\nsocket preservation, and ridge augmentation showed new bone\nformation and the crestal bone resorption during the follow-up\nperiod was very low.\nPang et al . [ 34], compared clinical and histological per-\nformances  of  autogenous  demineralized  dentin  matrix  from\nextracted tooth versus anorganic bovine bone in 33 cases of\nsocket  preservation  after  tooth  extraction.  They  found  new\nbone  formation  and  vertical  bone  increase  in  both  groups\nwithout  any  significant  difference.\nThe results showed by the present study confirmed those\nshowed by Kim YK et al.,  that found favorable bony healing\nby osteoconduction in a GBR case series study with 15 patients\nand a 31-month follow-up period [35].\nThis paper shows clinical and radiological observations of\na limited number of cases in which tooth graft was used for\nbone  regeneration  procedures.  Standardized  and  controlled\nstudies with large sample size are needed, in the next future, to\nvalidate the findings of the present case series analysis.\nCONCLUSION\nThis innovative device allowed to process and use, as bone\ngraft,  any  patient’s  tooth  in  a  very  short  time.  All\ndecontamination, disinfection and demineralization processes\nare totally electronically managed by the machine itself without\nany possibility of human error or injury.\nFuture studies with long follow up period are needed in\norder to better evaluate the potential of demineralized dentin\nautografts.\nETHICS  APPROVAL  AND  CONSENT  TO  PART-\nICIPATE\nNot applicable.\nHUMAN AND ANIMAL RIGHTS\nNo animals/humans were used for studies that are the basis\n(Table 1) contd.....\nThe Tooth Transformer The Open Dentistry Journal, 2019, Volume 13   13\nof this study.\nCONSENT FOR PUBLICATION\nAn informed and written consent to the surgical treatment\nwas obtained from each patient.\nFUNDING\nNone.\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST\nThe  authors  declare  no  conflict  of  interest,  financial  or\notherwise.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nMarco Berardini and Paolo Trisi claim to have no financial\ninterest,  either  directly  or  indirectly,  in  the  products  or\ninformation listed in the article.
