  "abstract": "Power transformers are designed to supply linear loads at nominal frequency; however, the development of power electronic devices and controllable loads that is generally called non-linear loads is promotion. Non-linear loads lead to temperature rise of transformers significantly and causes decrease their lifespan dramatically. In addition harmonics causes reduced power factor, which causes to reduce active power delivered to consumers. One of the methods to prevent and reduce harmonics is to use C-type passive filters regarding their advantages over other types of filters. Determining the relevant parameters is prerequisite to the application of such filters. In this paper, model of distribution transformer considering the effects of harmonic and saturation with C-type passive filters is optimized. Performance of different optimizing methods is compared with each other in optimization of model's parameters. Simulation results shown the invasive weed optimization method is an intelligent optimization method with appropriate performance compared with other methods.",
