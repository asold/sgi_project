In current \nclinical dosimetry practice, MIRD formalisms are widely employed. However, with the rapid advancement of deep learn-\ning (DL) algorithms, there has been an increasing interest in leveraging the calculation speed and automation capabilities \nfor different tasks. We aimed to develop a hybrid transformer-based deep learning (DL) model that incorporates a multiple \nvoxel S-value (MSV) approach for voxel-level dosimetry in  [177Lu]Lu-DOTATATE therapy. The goal was to enhance the \nperformance of the model to achieve accuracy levels closely aligned with Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, considered as \nthe standard of reference. We extended our analysis to include MIRD formalisms (SSV and MSV), thereby conducting a \ncomprehensive dosimetry study.\nMethods We used a dataset consisting of 22 patients undergoing up to 4 cycles of  [177Lu]Lu-DOTATATE therapy. MC \nsimulations were used to generate reference absorbed dose maps. In addition, MIRD formalism approaches, namely, single \nS-value (SSV) and MSV techniques, were performed. A UNEt TRansformer (UNETR) DL architecture was trained using \nfive-fold cross-validation to generate MC-based dose maps. Co-registered CT images were fed into the network as input, \nwhereas the difference between MC and MSV (MC-MSV) was set as output. DL results are then integrated to MSV to revive \nthe MC dose maps. Finally, the dose maps generated by MSV, SSV, and DL were quantitatively compared to the MC refer-\nence at both voxel level and organ level (organs at risk and lesions).\nResults The DL approach showed slightly better performance (voxel relative absolute error (RAE) = 5.28 ± 1.32) compared \nto MSV (voxel RAE = 5.54 ± 1.4) and outperformed SSV (voxel RAE = 7.8 ± 3.02). Gamma analysis pass rates were 99.0 \n± 1.2%, 98.8 ± 1.3%, and 98.7 ± 1.52% for DL, MSV, and SSV approaches, respectively. The computational time for MC \nwas the highest (~2 days for a single-bed SPECT study) compared to MSV, SSV, and DL, whereas the DL-based approach \noutperformed the other approaches in terms of time efficiency (3 s for a single-bed SPECT). Organ-wise analysis showed \nabsolute percent errors of 1.44 ± 3.05%, 1.18 ± 2.65%, and 1.15 ± 2.5% for SSV, MSV, and DL approaches, respectively, \nin lesion-absorbed doses.\nConclusion A hybrid transformer-based deep learning model was developed for fast and accurate dose map generation, \noutperforming the MIRD approaches, specifically in heterogenous regions. The model achieved accuracy close to MC gold \nstandard and has potential for clinical implementation for use on large-scale datasets.\nKeywords Radiation dosimetry · Radionuclide therapy · Deep learning · Monte Carlo simulation · [177Lu]Lu-DOTATATE\nIntroduction\nRadiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT) has emerged as a prom-\nising approach for managing various cancers, thus enabling \nselective delivery of high radiation dose to the target while \nminimizing toxicity to normal tissues [1 , 2]. Among RPT \ntechniques, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) \nZahra Mansouri and Yazdan Salimi contributed equally to this \nmanuscript.\nExtended author information available on the last page of the article\n1517European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2024) 51:1516–1529 \nwith  [177Lu]Lu-DOTATATE has demonstrated efficacy \nin palliative treatment of patients diagnosed with non-\nresectable metastatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) with \nsignificant improvement in their overall survival and pro-\ngression-free survival [3 , 4]. The commonly used standard \npractice of this treatment employs “one-size-fits-all” empiri-\ncal protocol, consisting of the delivery of four cycles of 7.4 \nGBq at 8-week intervals [5, 6]. However, this regimen may \nnot be optimal for individual variations in tumor burden, \npatient physiology, body size, and overall health condition. \nTherefore, a personalized dosimetry and treatment planning \napproach is indispensable to ensure a balance between thera-\npeutic efficacy and patient safety [7].\nImplementing personalized dosimetry as a prerequisite \nfor treatment planning in routine clinical setting poses chal-\nlenges owing to (i) the lack of standardized image quanti-\nfication and dosimetry protocols [8 , 9], (ii) lack or weak \ndose-effect relationship information [10], (iii) lack of suit-\nable radiobiological models [11], (iv) inherent low-quality \nand incomplete imaging data at different time points [12], \n(v) the heterogeneity of tumors and organs at risk (OARs), \nand (vi) the variability of patients’ physiology. Besides, time \nand labor resource requirements [11, 13] further complicate \nthe process.\nOn the other hand, traditional image-based organ-level \ndosimetry approaches based on MIRD formalism may not \nsuffice for patient-specific purposes as they rely on using \ntabulated organ-level S-values derived from standard phan-\ntoms [14]. These S -values can neither reflect activity het-\nerogeneities within a region of interest nor do they account \nfor inter-patient anatomical differences [15]. Voxel-level \nimage-based dosimetry approaches have gained popularity \nas an alternative to overcome this limitation. Direct Monte \nCarlo (MC) is the consensual gold standard approach for \nvoxel-level dose calculations which provides accurate and \nreliable dose estimation by considering the individual non-\nhomogeneity of both anatomical and activity distribution \ninto account. However, its extensive computational require-\nments make it impractical for routine clinical use [16–19].\nTo address the challenges associated with MC, vari-\nous voxel-level dosimetry methods have been developed \n[20–22]. This includes the single S -value (SSV) approach \nusing the MIRD scheme pre-tabulated S -values, which \nlacks consideration of anatomical heterogeneities as in these \napproaches dose calculations occurs within homogenous \nwater medium [21]. Another approach is the multiple voxel \nS-value (MSV) technique in which instead of using a single-\ndose kernel calculated in soft tissue, multiple-dose kernels \nare used according to different tissue densities [22].\nDeep learning (DL) has been successfully employed for \ndifferent computational medical imaging tasks [23– 29]. \nThere have been some attempts to use DL-based voxel-wise \ninternal dosimetry in previous studies [15, 30–33]. Lee et al. \nemployed a U-net trained by PET and CT image patches as \ninput to generate 3D voxel-level dose rate maps [30]. Kim \net al. [33] developed a modified U-net model for voxel-\nwise  [177Lu]Lu-DOTATATE dosimetry, incorporating CT \nand time-integrated activity (TIA) patch images as an input \nfollowed by a summation of MSV dose map for residual \nlearning and validated their model through comparison with \ndirect MC calculation at both organ and voxel levels. In the \nstudy by Li et al. [32], a residual deep convolutional neu-\nral network (CNN) trained with virtual patients obtained \nfrom PET images instead of SPECT/CT images was used to \nestimate the dose-rate maps compensated for blurring due \nto the poor spatial resolution of SPECT images. While the \nabovementioned studies benefited from utilizing CNNs, the \napplication of transformer architectures remains limited in \ndosimetry tasks [34]. Transformers benefit from self-atten-\ntion and can process the input data in parallel which leads \nto increased efficacy. In addition, they can achieve adequate \nperformance with very limited training data [35– 38].\nThe main objective of the present work is to evaluate a \nhybrid transformer-based deep learning network for voxel-\nlevel dosimetry of  [177Lu]Lu-DOTATATE RPT in terms of \ncomputational costs and accuracy of absorbed dose calcu-\nlations. To this end, we trained an MSV/DL hybrid model \nto predict the necessary corrections on MSV dose maps to \ngenerate MC dose maps as the ground-truth. Subsequently, \nDL-based absorbed dose distributions were validated by \ncomparing the results with MC-based absorbed dose distri-\nbutions. SSV and MSV dose maps were also calculated for \nfurther comparison.\nMaterial and methods\nPatient characteristics and data acquisition\nThis retrospective study included SPECT/CT images from \n50 sessions of 22 patients with NETs who underwent  [177Lu]\nLu-DOTATATE therapy for up to 4 cycles. The injected \nactivity was personalized for each cycle (median: 7363 \nMBq, range 1017–9657 MBq) based on kidney function, \nbody habitus, and dosimetry results [39]. Patient character -\nistics are summarized in Table 1. The images were acquired \non a Symbia T16 SPECT/CT camera (Siemens Healthineers, \nGermany) equipped with a medium-energy low-penetration \ncollimator (MELP). The images at multiple time points were \nacquired at ~4 h (range 3.6–5.3), 24 h (range 19.6–25.0), 69 \nh (range 67.2–74.1), and 120 h post-injection. The recon -\nstructed CT images had a matrix size of 512 × 512, acquired \nat 110 kVp and 126.48 ± 37.2 mAs with a voxel size of \n0.9766 × 0.9766 × 5  mm3. SPECT images had a 128 × \n128 matrix size, zoom factor of 1, and voxel size of 4.795 \n× 4.795 × 4.795  mm3. SPECT projections were obtained \n1518 European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2024) 51:1516–1529\nin 96 views (48 camera spots) with a duration of 15 s for \nthe two first time points and 20 s for the last time points. \nSPECT images were reconstructed using a 3-dimensional \nordered-subset expectation maximization (3D-OSEM) algo-\nrithm with 4 iterations and 8 subsets with resolution recov -\nery, including CT-based attenuation correction, dual-energy \nwindow (DEW) scatter correction using [187.2–228.8] and \n[166.4–187.2] keV for photopeak and scatter windows, \nrespectively [40]. The activity calibration, i.e., translating \nthe reconstructed counts (count/s) into absolute activity (Bq/\nml), was performed using a cylindrical phantom (Jaszczak) \nfilled with known uniform activity concentration [41].\n[177Lu]Lu‑DOTATATE dosimetry workflow\nMonte Carlo simulations\nThe dose maps generated through direct Monte Carlo served \nas standard of reference and were used as the target for train-\ning our network. For this purpose, patient-specific density \nmaps (g/cm 3) were derived from CT images (Hounsfield \nunits) as described by Schneider et al. [42]. These density \nmaps, along with time-integrated activities (TIAs) (fur -\nther elaborated below), were input into a previously vali -\ndated [15] MCNP MC simulator (version 2.3, Los Alamos \nNational Laboratory) [43] generate the voxel-level absorbed \ndose map. About  108 histories were simulated wherein the \nstatistical uncertainty was considered negligible [44 ]. All \ncalculations were performed using a 12th Gen Intel ®  core™ \ni7-12700K CPU at 3.6 GHz.\nTime‑integrated activities\nTIAs were obtained from multiple time points of post-treat-\nment SPECT images through the following steps:\n1. A previously trained RESUNET deep learning model \nwas used to automatically delineate organs at risk \n(OARs) on the CT images of hybrid SPECT/CT acquired \nafter  [177Lu]Lu-DOTATATE administration followed by \nmanual adjustment of the contours. The Dice coefficients \n(%) for the liver, kidneys, spleen, bones, lung, and blad-\nder were 97, 94, 95, 94, 98, and 84, respectively [45].\n2. Malignant tumors were delineated on SPECT images \nmanually by an experienced nuclear medicine specialist.\n3. An intensity-based SPECT-SPECT registration with \na mutual information-based cost function was applied \nto multiple-time-point post-treatment serial SPECT \nimages followed by visual inspection. The registration \nwas automated using an in-house MATLAB code based \non Elastix1.\n4. Time activity curves (TACs) were generated at the voxel \nlevel for tumors and OARs based on 177Lu-kinetics from \nmulti-time-point registered SPECT images. In this \nregard, a trapezoid function was fitted to the TAC at \neach voxel for data points with time <24 h, followed by \na mono-exponential function C /parenleft.s1e−/u1D706t/parenright.s1 , where C scales the \ncurve and λ is the biological clearance/elimination rate \nfor data points (if available) with t > 24 h.\n5. The TIA was calculated by estimating the area under the \ntime-activity curve, using a combination of trapezoidal \nand exponential integrations, depending on the number \nof available time points, as proposed in Ref. [41]. To \nmitigate potential errors caused by reconstruction noise \nor registration issues, the effective half-lives (Teff) were \ndetermined based on the mean value of normal distri-\nbution of voxel-level /u1D706 in the volume of interest (VOI). \nFigure 1 illustrates the steps taken for TIA calculation.\nSingle and multiple voxel S‑value (SSV and MSV) \napproaches\nThe MIRD scheme SSV and MSV dose maps were calcu-\nlated for further comparisons. The voxel S -value kernels \nwere generated using MCNP transport code (version 2.3, \nLos Alamos National Laboratory) [43]. The simulation code \nhas been previously validated [15] and the kernels bench-\nmarked against the database from Ref. [46]. The MSV \napproach involves the utilization of 8 pre-calculated voxel \nS-value kernels. These kernels are computed using the MC \nmethod within various types of tissues, including lung, adi-\npose, soft tissue, and five different densities corresponding \nto bones. Subsequently, MSV dose map was calculated by \nthe convolution of the multiple kernels into TIA according \nto the method proposed by Lee et al. [22].\nNetwork training\nBefore training, the CT images underwent normalization \nusing an empirical factor of  103 to reduce the dynamic range \nTable 1  Summary of patient demographics and treatment character -\nistics\nNumber of patients/total therapy cycles 21/55\nGender (F:M) 8 (38%):13 (62%)\nAge, median (range) 62 (26–78)\nHeight (m), median (range) 1.69 (1.5–1.84)\nWeight (kg), median (range) 76.8 (61.8–122.2)\nNumber of therapy cycles (1:2:3:4) (5:5:4:7)\nInjected activity (MBq), median (range) 7215 (1017–9657)\n1 https:// elast ix. lumc. nl/\n1519European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2024) 51:1516–1529 \nof voxel intensities and scale the Hounsfield units between \n0 and 1. Similarly, the TIA images were normalized using a \nfixed factor of 1.5 ×  1010 without clipping the data.\nA modified UNEt TRansformer (UNETR) architecture \nproposed by Hatamizadeh et al. [47] was implemented in \nPytorch, and trained on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 \nGPU. The dataset was split into 5 sets for 5-fold cross vali-\ndation ensuring each set had the same size of data, while \nwe ensured that the multiple cycles from the same patient \nare never in the test and train at the same time. Training \nwas performed using 2D axial slices. The network was fed \nby co-registered CT images as input with a total of 1000 \nepochs, initial learning rate of 0.001, and a weight decay of \n0.0001. The batch size was set to 128. The mean squared \nerror (MSE) loss function and Adam optimizer were utilized. \nThe target of the network was the difference between MC-\nsimulated dose maps and MSV dose maps (MC − MSV). \nInstead of directly generating MC dose maps, the DL output \nwas set to be the difference between MC and MSV. Finally, \nMSV was added to the DL output for further evaluation \n(i.e., DL = MC − MSV; subsequently, MC = DL + MSV). \nFigure 2 displays the network architecture. We adopted this \napproach by hypothesizing that MSV closely approximates \nMC, with errors primarily limited to small heterogeneous \nand boundary regions. Training a model capable of correct-\ning these errors was anticipated to contribute to performance \nenhancement.\nWe also tried multiple approaches and strategies prior to \nselecting the transformer-based method. First, we investi-\ngated configurations of modified UNet by using versions of \nMONAI DynUNet class [48, 49]. Following unsatisfactory \nperformance, we employed U2-Net architecture [50] by \nusing two inputs of CT + TIA to skip the need for MSV \ncalculations in MC dose map prediction. As the results were \nnot conclusive, another strategy was adopted in which CT \n+ MSV was alternatively used as inputs to predict the MC \ndose map. The initial settings (learning rate, decay, number \nof epochs, etc.) were the same as those utilized in the current \nmodel. Moreover, we attempted multiple configurations of \n2D axial slices and 3D boxes as inputs to the model. How -\never, these strategies did not yield the expected outcomes.\nEvaluation strategy\nThe DL-generated and calculated dose maps using the two \nMIRD formalisms, namely, SSV and MSV, were quantita-\ntively compared to the reference MC dose maps using vari-\nous metrics. These include voxel-wise root mean square error \n(RMSE), mean square error (MSE), mean absolute error \n(MAE), mean error (ME), structural similarity index (SSIM), \npeak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), relative error (RE), and \nrelative absolute error (RAE). Additionally, Gamma index \nevaluation was performed with the criteria of 4.795-mm dis-\ntance to agreement (DTA) and 1% dose difference (DD). The \nGamma pass rates and Gamma maps were calculated to assess \nthe dose distribution agreement between DL, MSV, and SSV \nand the MC reference. The pass rates were calculated accord-\ning to Eq.

These TIA maps, along \nwith density maps, served as input for various dosimetry calculation \napproaches\n1520 European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2024) 51:1516–1529\nMoreover, organ-wise absorbed doses were compared \namong all the mentioned strategies in terms of organ error \n(%) and organ absolute error (%).

Voxel-wise quantitative metrics \nfor three dosimetry approaches with respect to MC are \ntabulated in Table  2. Our DL approach achieved the low -\nest errors (e.g., RMSE, ME, MAE, MSE, RE, RAE) and \nmaximum resemblance representatives (e.g., SSIM, PSNR, \nGamma pass rates). The distribution of these quantitative \nmetrics is visualized using violin plots in Fig.  4. Addition-\nally, as a result of employing the 5-fold cross-validation \napproach, these quantitative metrics and their distribution \nare reported separately for each fold in Supplementary \nTable 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1, respectively.\nWe conducted a 3D Gamma evaluation considering \nMC dose maps as standard of reference. Figure  5 presents \nan example of Gamma maps with the highest number of \nrejected voxels (Gamma value >1) in the SSV approach. \nOur hybrid DL approach, on the other hand, generated \ndose maps with reduced number of rejected points in this \nevaluation. Furthermore, we performed the Gamma evalu -\nation within the lesion volumes, and the pass rates were \nfound to be 96.8 ± 6%, 97.2 ± 5.3%, and 97.35 ± 5.1% \nfor SSV, MSV, and hybrid DL approaches, respectively.\nAdditionally, we reported the organ-level errors for \nlesions and OARs in Table  3. Our hybrid DL approach \nshowed a reduction in error values for most organs, except \nfor the left kidney. Organ-wise errors for each fold are also \nreported in Supplementary Table 3.

While for the whole inference on CPU \nfor desktops not equipped with dedicated GPU, the whole \ncomputational time was 4 min. On the other hand, the dose \nmap calculation based on SSV and MSV took ~1.2 h each \non CPU. However, MC calculation was the most time-con-\nsuming technique, taking about 2 days on CPU to simulate \n100 million histories. \nDiscussion\nFast and accurate generation of dose maps may help the \nimplementation and adoption of personalized dosimetry \nin RPT in the clinic. A modified UNETR model com-\nbined with MSV was developed to achieve efficient and \naccurate voxel-wise dosimetry for  [177Lu]Lu-DOTATATE \ntherapy. This study evaluated organ- and voxel-wise errors \nin comparison to MC dose calculation, considered as \nstandard of reference. While this study does not aim to \nconduct a direct head-to-head comparison of independent \napproaches, we included the analysis of the voxel S -value \nMIRD formalisms to ensure a comprehensive dosimetry \ninvestigation. Additionally, our objective is to highlight \nand demonstrate the potential limitations associated with \nthese approaches. One of the motivations behind employ -\ning a DL network for  [177Lu]Lu-DOTATATE voxel-wise \ndosimetry was the limitation of current voxel-level MIRD \nformalisms. In the SSV approach, the dose map from a \nradiopharmaceutical is constructed through the convo -\nlution of only one voxel S-value kernel (water) with the \nTIA calculated from emission tomography images (PET \nor SPECT). This approach does not account for organ het-\nerogeneities [21]. The alternative MIRD-based dosimetry \napproach, referred to as multiple S -value (MSV), utilizes \nmultiple kernels, overcoming the limitations of the SSV \ntechnique. However, it still presents visible errors in tissue \nboundaries and interfaces [22].\nMonte Carlo simulations were used as the gold standard. \nHowever, MC itself is prone to statistical errors and differ -\nences with real-world occurrences that may lead to missing \ndose heterogeneities. We had access to limited computa-\ntional resources, and hence, only 100 million tracked parti-\ncles were simulated which means the MC itself is prone to \nsampling statistical errors even negligible [44]. Besides, the \ninherent approximations within MC calculations and geom-\netry simplifications may not accurately capture the complex-\nity of clinical scenarios.\nIn a broader point of view, the distinctions among SSV, \nMSV, and MC techniques lie in the extent of approxima-\ntions and assumptions made. SSV assumes uniform radi-\nation absorption across all tissues (assumed as water), \nwhereas MSV introduces tissue-specific kernels, reducing \nassumptions but increasing the descriptive parameters and \ncalculations. In contrast, MC makes the fewest assumptions \nbut requires more parameters to be defined. This explains \nthe superior performance of MSV over SSV and even better \nperformance of MC over MSV.\nNoteworthy, absorbed dose heterogeneity in the context of \nRPT includes both spatial and temporal heterogeneities. The \nfirst refers to uneven distribution of absorbed doses within \na VOI, while the second refers to the variation of absorbed \ndose rates over time due to pharmacokinetics and radioactive \ndecay. Although dynamic imaging or imaging in multiple time \npoints is performed to address the temporal heterogeneity, \nradiopharmaceutical kinetics is oversimplified in TAC fitting \nprocess [51]. The accuracy of TAC derivation depends on the \nspatial resolution of the imaging modality as well as the fre-\nquency of the time points. Low spatial resolution or infrequent \ntime points lead to inadequate capturing of rapid changes in \nradiotracer distributions, affecting the accuracy of TACs and, \nconsequently, the calculated absorbed doses. However, the \ninitial steps including time-point registration, curve fitting, \nand TIA calculations were similar for all four dose calculation \nmethods (SSV, MSV, MC, and DL) evaluated in this work.\nMost of the errors in voxel-wise dose calculations occur \nwhen using the SSV approach, which is evident in Fig.  3. \nThe SSV method overestimates the absorbed dose values \ninside the low-density tissues, such as the lungs, and under-\nestimates the absorbed dose values in tissues with high den-\nsity, such as bones. While MSV mitigated these errors, it still \nshowed limitations in high-gradient tissue density regions, \ni.e., the tissue boundaries (lung/soft tissue and bone/soft tis-\nsue). However, our proposed hybrid DL model effectively \nreduced errors in these areas as confirmed by Gamma maps \n(Fig. 5). Our method improves the MSV dose map accuracy \nboth in voxel-level and organ-level evaluations as presented \nin Figs.  4 and 6 . Although Gamma evaluation pass rates \nwere reported, displaying Gamma maps allowed observ -\ning regions of failure. In addition, lesion-wise Gamma \nevaluation indicated a slightly higher pass rate for the DL \napproach. To the best of our knowledge, there is no guide-\nline indicating a specific criterion for Gamma evaluation in \ntargeted radiotherapy. However, the chosen criteria (DTA = \n4.79 mm and DD = 1%) were based on the spatial resolu-\ntion of SPECT images as a determinative factor and external \nbeam radiation therapy standards.\nDVHs are shown in supplementary Figure 2, where we \ncan compare the dose distributions visually. The rationale \nbehind using DVHs relies on their ability to provide a com-\nprehensive and quantitative summary of dose distribution. \nThis involves representing the percentage volume of a vol-\nume of interest (VOI) that receives a specific dose or higher \n(Vx (%)) or a specific absorbed dose received by a percent-\nage of volume (Dx (Gy)). This quantitative data is crucial to \nevaluate the delivered absorbed doses to lesions and OARs, \nespecially for heterogenous dose distributions. DVHs visually \n1526 European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2024) 51:1516–1529\ndepict dose distribution, facilitating straightforward compari-\nsons between different dose distributions. Although DVHs \nare well-studied for handling heterogeneous dose distribu-\ntions, they are not able to provide spatial information on \nwhere dose inhomogeneities occur within the volume. Fur -\nthermore, by simplifying the complex 3D dose distribution \ninto a single metric for each dose level, DVHs may overlook \nspecific geometric patterns or gradients that hold clinical sig-\nnificance. Additionally, the granularity of a DVH depends \non the selected dose-volume bin size, and slight changes in \nbin size can alter the shape of the DVH curve, potentially \ninfluencing interpretations [52]. One of the reasons that pre-\nvented us from distinguishing the differences among vari-\nous dosimetry approaches using DVHs is attributed to the \nabsence of spatial information. To address this limitation, we \nhave employed Gamma analysis and visualized the results to \nidentify specific regions showing observed differences.\nIn this study, a transformer-based UNET-shaped model \nwas utilized. To our knowledge, in dosimetry-related stud-\nies, CNNs have been mostly utilized, while the applica -\ntion of transformers in this specific task remains limited \n[34, 5 4]. Transformer-based models are generally used in \nNatural Language Processing (NLP) with the capability of \nhighlighting the important features of word sequences due \nto self-attention mechanism [47, 54]. The computational \nefficiency and superiority of our model in image domain-\nrelated tasks, such as organ segmentation, has been demon-\nstrated compared to state-of-the-art CNNs [34, 47]. While \nthe optimal performance of complex transformers often \nrelies on the availability of a large-scale dataset, our model \nas a less-complex transformer model does not necessarily \nperform better using larger-scale dataset. It should be men-\ntioned that the true value of a large-scale dataset lies in its \ncapacity to inject diversity into the training process. The \nabsence of diversity in a large-scale dataset may result in \nsuboptimal performance when applied on external datasets. \nIn our study, despite the limited size of our dataset, we \npaid attention to diversity by including various patients with \npersonalized injected activities ranging from 1017 to 9657 \nMBq. While transformer-based models may not consistently \noutperform other networks in terms of performance met-\nrics, their adaptability to small-size datasets, proficiency in \nmanaging diversity, and ability to capture complicated rela-\ntionships make them well-suited for personalized dosimetry \ntasks. Nevertheless, to cope with the inherent black-box \nnature of deep learning methods, including transformers, \nthe development of explainable AI models to enhance the \ninterpretability and trustworthiness of the predicted results \nis suggested [55].\nIt is worth mentioning that before opting for the current \napproach, we tried other strategies involving the use of other \nnetworks, such as UNET and U2-NET. However, the results \nwere not as favorable as using the adopted network. The best \nresults we could achieve through other networks or strategies \nare summarized in Supplementary Table 4.\nNoteworthy, the size, shape, and texture variations of \norgans/lesions, as well as SPECT and CT images, in different \nregions of interest, can influence the performance of the DL \nmethod, justifying distinct errors in various regions of interest.\nDespite using limited training data, our hybrid model \nprovided fast and accurate voxel-wise dose estimations. \nDose map generation time for an image size of 128 × 128 \n× 80 voxels is approximately 1 min, which is an impressive \nimprovement compared to MC running time. The model per-\nformance was consistent among folds showing robustness. \nMoreover, the DL approach exhibited a slight advantage \nover MIRD-based dose calculations, consistent with recent \nstudies on  [177Lu]Lu-DOTATATE dosimetry calculated by \nDL [33, 53]. In this study, rather than directly generating \nMC dose maps, we calculated the difference between MC \nand MSV which resulted in further error reduction. Since \nMSV provides a good approximation of MC dose maps, \nand errors only occur in small heterogeneous and boundary \nregions, therefore, training a model that focuses on correct-\ning these errors helped in performance improvement. The \nnetwork predicts the difference map based on anatomical \ninformation in the CT image. Although generating the dif-\nference dose map between MC and MSV requires the MSV \ndose map calculations to perform the DL-based dosimetry \ncalculation, once the model has been trained, the infer -\nence time (~1 min including pre- and post-processing) is \nnegligible compared to the MSV calculation time (~1.2 h). \nNevertheless, it is important to highlight the dependence of \nthe proposed approach on the MSV map post-inferencing \nto reconstruct the MC dose map, as outlined in the “Mate-\nrial and methods ” section (predicted MC = DL + MSV). \nTherefore, the DL model is presented as a hybrid MSV/DL \nmodel, and the inference time should be added to MSV cal-\nculation time (1.2 h on CPU + 1 min). As described in the \n“Material and methods” section, the MSV calculations were \nperformed on CPU. We implemented the MSV calculation \npart on GPU to accelerate the procedure. Indeed, GPU-based \ncomputations for MSV would further reduce the calculation \ntime (14 s for each voxel S-value kernel of MSV for a 2-bed \nSPECT image with a resolution of ~4.8 mm traceable on P#6 \nof SNMMI dosimetry challenge dataset [13]). Therefore, \nconducting our hybrid DL approach on GPU would take ~3 \nmin for a two-bed SPECT (MSV with 8 kernels ~2 min, and \ninference time ~1 min).\nAutomated tools, such as OAR segmentation, which is the \nmost time-consuming step in the dosimetry workflow, and \nSPECT-SPECT registration facilitated and accelerated our \nstudy. The OAR segmentation model demonstrated a high \ndegree of reliability as reflected by the performance metrics \n(high Dice coefficients) [45]. This model can be employed in \ndosimetry workflow of other radionuclides and embedded in \n1527European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2024) 51:1516–1529 \ntreatment planning systems. It should be mentioned that organ \nsegmentation on CT images is a more practical approach, yet \nsusceptible to potential errors arising from the different reso-\nlutions of CT and SPECT images, the spill-in/out phenomena \nin SPECT images, and the likely mismatch between SPECT \nand CT images. Lesion segmentation was manually carried \nout by a physician, considering both SPECT and CT images, \nalong with the fused image at all three time points.\nThe SPECT-SPECT registration for the generation of \nTIA has an advantage over transformation methods based \non the CT of hybrid SPECT/CT, avoiding issues with mis-\nalignment errors in SPECT-CT co-registered images origi-\nnating from patient movement and respiratory motion [44, \n56]. However, given the time intervals between different \nacquisitions, several factors introduce challenges to achiev-\ning precise alignment even with SPECT-SPECT registra-\ntion approach. These factors include patient motion, fluctua-\ntions in radiopharmaceutical distribution, radioactive decay, \ninherent image noise and poor spatial resolution, lack of \nanatomic information, and anatomical-related variables, \nsuch as nutritional and voiding status of the patient. The \ncomplicated interplay of these dynamic elements necessi-\ntates a comprehensive appraisal to ensure accurate and reli-\nable image registration [56]. The incorporation of trapezoi-\ndal and mono-exponential TAC fitting in this study allowed \nmodeling both the uptake and washout of the tracer, which is \nnot achievable by using mono-exponential TAC fitting alone \n[13], particularly in organs at risk, such as the kidneys [41].\nThis study bears inherently a number of limitations, \nincluding the small sample size. Yet, the results demon-\nstrated the effectiveness of the network with a 5-fold cross-\nvalidation strategy. Furthermore, the unavailability of diag-\nnostic images for accurate tumor delineation may lead to \nunderestimation of absorbed dose values [13]. Manual lesion \nsegmentation on SPECT/CT images introduces inherent \nsources of error, particularly in cases where the lesions are \ndistributed across various anatomical regions. The reliance \non visually selected image windowing (window width and \nwindow level) poses challenges in accurately defining lesion \nborders. Such misalignments adversely impact the accuracy \nof TAC calculation, as the delineated lesion may include \nvoxels from surrounding tissues. Conversely, there is a possi-\nbility of missing part of the lesion when using this approach.\nAnother limitation of our study is that users are required to \ncompute the MSV dose maps for reconstructing MC estimate \nfrom DL results. Nevertheless, the MSV dose map can serve \nas a conventional method with a known extent of error, aid-\ning in identifying cases where the DL dose map prediction \nmay be unreliable in an external dataset. The time required \nfor MSV calculation contributes to the safety of our method-\nology in identifying outliers in an external, unseen dataset. \nAnother limitation of this work is the use of mono-centric \ninstead of multi-institutional datasets to ensure the robustness \nand generalizability of trained hybrid DL model, and as such, \nfurther evaluation on larger multi-centric datasets is still \nrequired.\nConclusion\nThis work aimed at developing a hybrid transformer-based \ndeep learning model incorporating the MSV approach, \ntrained for fast and accurate generation of absorbed dose \nmaps. The results demonstrated superiority of this hybrid \nnetwork over the MIRD SSV approach, and a slight improve-\nment compared to the MSV approach while significantly \noutperforming MC in terms of computational efficiency. \nIt can be concluded that our method achieved an accuracy \nclose to the gold standard and surpassed it in terms of time \nand computational effort, making it more readily applicable \nin clinical setting once trained using a large-scale and multi-\ncentric dataset. In summary, according to our results, using \nthe MSV method is recommended for organ-level dosim-\netry, whereas MC or hybrid DL method is suggested for \nvoxel-wise dosimetry, especially for small lesions/organs in \nregions with high gradient of density.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplemen-\ntary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s00259- 024- 06618-9.\nFunding Open access funding provided by University of Geneva This \nwork was supported by the Euratom Research and Training Programme \n2019–2020 Sinfonia Project under grant agreement no. 945196 and \nthe Swiss National Foundation under grant No: P500PT_211066.\nDeclarations \nEthical approval All procedures performed in studies involving human \nparticipants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the insti-\ntutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki \ndeclaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.\nInformed consent Informed consent was obtained from all individual \nparticipants included in the study.\nConflict of interest The authors declare no competing interests.\nOpen Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attri-\nbution 4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing, adapta-\ntion, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long \nas you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, \nprovide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if changes \nwere made.
