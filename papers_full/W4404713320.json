    "abstract": "In the emerging field of computational gastronomy, aligning culinary practices with scientifically supported nutritional goals is increasingly important. This study explores how large language models (LLMs) can be applied to optimize ingredient substitutions in recipes, specifically to enhance the phytochemical content of meals. Phytochemicals are bioactive compounds found in plants, which, based on preclinical studies, may offer potential health benefits. We fine-tuned models, including OpenAI’s GPT-3.5-Turbo, DaVinci-002, and Meta’s TinyLlama-1.1B, using an ingredient substitution dataset. These models were used to predict substitutions that enhance the phytochemical content and to create a corresponding enriched recipe dataset. Our approach improved the top ingredient prediction accuracy on substitution tasks, from the baseline 34.53 ± 0.10% to 38.03 ± 0.28% on the original substitution dataset and from 40.24 ± 0.36% to 54.46 ± 0.29% on a refined version of the same dataset. These substitutions led to the creation of 1951 phytochemically enriched ingredient pairings and 1639 unique recipes. While this approach demonstrates potential in optimizing ingredient substitutions, caution must be taken when drawing conclusions about health benefits, as the claims are based on preclinical evidence. This research represents a step forward in using AI to promote healthier eating practices, providing potential pathways for integrating computational methods with nutritional science.",
