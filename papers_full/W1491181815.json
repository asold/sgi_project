  "full_text": "Chapter 8\nReview of Tools Used for Assessing Teachers’ Level of\nKnowledge with Regards Attention Deficit\nHyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)\nMarian Soroa, Arantxa Gorostiaga and\nNekane Balluerka\nAdditional information is available at the end of the chapter\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/54277\n1. Introduction\nADHD  is  currently  one  of  most  widely  studied  neuro-developmental  disorders in  chil‐\ndren and adolescents. It is a severe disorder that can cause grave problems for sufferers\nand those around them. The interest in the study of ADHD in the scientific community\nis undeniable, as proved by the multitude of articles and books on the subject published\nannually. As indicated by Lavigne and Romero [1], interest in this condition is such that\nit has breached the boundaries of academic research and study and has become a social\nphenomenon  in  itself,  to  such  an  extent  that  any  child  who  shows  a  certain  degree  of\nactivity,  who  does  not  remain  seated  and  quiet  for  hours  and  does  not  instantly  obey\neach  and  every  instruction  he  or  she  receives  is  immediately  suspected  of  having\nADHD. The readiness with which children are labeled as having ADHD is surely due,\nin  part,  to  the  lack  of  information  about  the  various  factors  apart  from  ADHD,  that\ncause lack of attention, hyperactivity and/or impulsiveness.\nNeither are teachers free from the tendency to attribute ADHD to too many children in spite\nof having greater possibilities of obtaining more reliable information about ADHD either\nthrough professional articles and books, training courses or other professionals at their\nschools that work with pupils with ADHD, etc. Despite this greater ease of access to infor‐\nmation, various studies have shown that teachers’ knowledge of ADHD could be improved\n[2-7]. Furthermore the knowledge teachers have about ADHD is also the source of ever\ngreater interest among scientists as they are actors with a key role in the development of the\ncondition. The training of educators in this area is of direct benefit to students with ADHD\n© 2013 Soroa et al.; licensee InTech.

For this reason, in order to find out exactly what level of knowledge\nteachers have about this problem it is crucial to have assessment tools with appropriate psy‐\nchometric properties, that are reliable and valid and that provide accurate data about teach‐\ners’ knowledge of ADHD.\nIn this chapter, the fundamental reasons for which teachers have to have a basic level of\nknowledge of ADHD are examined, an exhaustive analysis is carried out of the main instru‐\nments which have been developed to assess teachers’ knowledge of ADHD, and the chapter\nends with the main conclusions drawn from this study.\n2. ADHD and teachers\nADHD is currently one of the disorders that has generated the largest number of research\nstudies among the scientific community but despite this, in the words of Barkley [ 8], a lot\nremains unknown or misunderstood about it. Teachers, along with the family, are one of the\nmost important agents of socialization during infancy, so they are one of the most suitable\ngroups to receive information and training with regard to ADHD. A significant percentage\nof teachers have false ideas or gaps in their knowledge of ADHD, which causes them to be‐\nhave inappropriately in the classroom. In this regard, it has been observed that specific\ntraining of teachers in the field and positive attitudes on their part have positive consequen‐\nces for children with ADHD.\nSoroa, Balluerka and Gorostiaga [ 9] hold that infant and primary school teachers should\nhave general and specific knowledge about ADHD for six fundamental reasons. Firstly, be‐\ncause ADHD is one of the most common psychological disorders among children. The\nAmerican Psychiatric Association [ 10] indicates that between 3% and 5% of school children\nsuffer from ADHD, that is to say that on average there is one pupil with ADHD in every\nclassroom of 25 [11-13].\nSecondly, teachers are in a uniquely advantageous position for detecting possible cases of\nADHD. They can pretty accurately distinguish normal development from what is not.\nTherefore, increasing teachers’ knowledge about ADHD can facilitate, among other factors,\nearly detection of the disorder and the application of the appropriate treatment [4, 14].\nThirdly, it should be noted that the role of the teacher is also essential in establishing the\ndiagnosis. The assessments made of the behavior of the students, along with those of the pa‐\nrents and the results of other tests to which children are subjected, are part of the data that\nallow the diagnosis to be established [4-6].\nFourthly, it should be noted that teachers play a very important role in the implementation,\nevaluation and support of the treatment received by children with ADHD [ 14]. Their coop‐\neration is necessary for the results of the treatment received by the child to be successful,\nand their evaluation of and opinions about the treatment of ADHD have a profound effect\non its efficacy [15].\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in Children and Adolescents152\nA fifth reason for teachers to be trained about ADHD lies in direct contact they have with\nthe parents of the children. Several authors have argued that teachers make recommenda‐\ntions, appropriate or inappropriate, about ADHD to the parents, who tend to follow such\nrecommendations [14, 16].\nThe sixth and final reason is that the knowledge that teachers have about ADHD affects\ntheir behavior and attitudes towards children with this condition [ 17]. Teachers with more\nknowledge about ADHD have a more favorable conduct and attitudes towards students\nwith this disorder [3, 16, 18].\nIn  spite  of  the  existence  of  many  reasons  why  teachers  should  have  knowledge  on\nADHD,  various  studies  have  shown  that,  in  general,  teachers  show  only  moderate\nknowledge  of  ADHD  and  that  it  is  necessary  to  improve  this  level  of  knowledge  [3-6,\n19, 20]. Also it must be noted that many teachers present a general lack of knowledge\nand/or false ideas on the nature, course, consequences, causes and treatment of ADHD\n[21]. In some research programmes the average percentage of correct answers by teach‐\ners  to  questionnaires  prepared  in  order  to  measure  their  knowledge  on  ADHD  was\naround 80% [14, 18, 22-24], while in other studies the average percentage of correct an‐\nswers did not exceed 53% [4-6, 20, 25]. At world level there is much research in prog‐\nress  on  the  knowledge  that  teachers  have  on  ADHD;  however,  there  is  a  scarcity  of\ninstruments to measure this knowledge precisely [9].\nIt has been found that teachers who consider that their level of knowledge about ADHD is\noptimum do not seek additional information; in contrast, those who consider that they do\nnot understand many aspects referring to this topic, do look for it. For this reason, it is im‐\nportant that the teachers should be aware of their actual knowledge about ADHD and the\npossible repercussions of a lack of knowledge or erroneous knowledge. For this purpose, it\nis essential to use evaluation instruments which have appropriate psychometric properties\nfor measuring such knowledge.\n3. Instruments for assessing the level of knowledge of teachers regarding\nADHD\nOver recent decades, many instruments have been developed in order to assess the level of\nknowledge of teachers regarding ADHD. Given that the school setting is probably the place\nwhere children and young people spend most of the day, it is important to have a range of\ninstruments to measure teacher knowledge about ADHD throughout the different stages of\nchild development. These instruments, in addition to identifying gaps that teachers may\nhave in their knowledge of the disorder, can be useful to educate the teachers about the\nneed for more training in this area.\nIn this section a review is carried out of each of the main instruments developed for the eval‐\nuation of teachers’ knowledge about ADHD. In the course of the description of each instru‐\nment their general characteristics are set out (the construct evaluated, items, response\nReview of Tools Used for Assessing Teachers’ Level of Knowledge with Regards Attention Deficit Hyperactivity\nDisorder (ADHD)\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/54277\n153\nformat, dimensionality, etc.), as well as their scoring rules and psychometric properties.\nTheir strengths and weaknesses are also evaluated. The instruments are presented in chro‐\nnological order.\n3.1. ADHD Knowledge Scale (Jerome, Gordon & Hustler, 1994) [23]\n3.1.1. Description and development\nThis instrument was developed by American and Canadian researchers, in the English lan‐\nguage, in order to assess the general knowledge of teachers regarding ADHD. It consists of\ntwo sections, the first includes 20 items that are socio-demographic in nature (age, sex, train‐\ning about ADHD, etc.) in a multiple choice format, and a second section with 20 items, 13\npositive and 7 negative, with a dichotomous (True/False) response format.\nIn the preparation of the questionnaire, the authors contacted several teachers and directors\nof special education to review the instrument. The authors do not provide more information\nabout the process.\nThe instrument was applied to a sample of 1289 elementary school teachers, 439 in the Unit‐\ned States and 850 in Canada. No information is given about the sampling procedure. 46% of\nthe sample in the United States was made up of teachers from the state of New York school\ndistrict, and 54% by teachers from Broward County in Florida. The majority were women\n(86%), aged between 31 and 50 (67%) and had been teachers for 9 or more years. 79% taught\nthe general school population in ordinary classes while 21% were special education teachers.\nThe Canadian sample consisted of teachers from a wide area of south west Ontario and no\nfurther information is given by the authors about it.\n3.1.2. Scoring rules\nCorrect answers receive 1 point and incorrect ones 0 points. So the range of possible scores\ngoes from 0, the lowest level of knowledge, to 20, for the highest.\n3.1.3. Psychometric properties\nNo publications have been found which provide validity evidences or reliability indices.\n3.1.4. Strengths and weaknesses\nThis is believed to be the first study designed to test the knowledge of elementary school\nteachers about ADHD. A great number of subsequent studies have used this questionnaire\nor been inspired by it due to its simplicity and that the fact that it was a pioneer in the field\nthat concerns us here. Furthermore, the sample used is very broad and heterogeneous. How‐\never, the response format is dichotomous, so does not provide detailed information about\nthe real knowledge the teachers have about ADHD. Furthermore, the psychometric proper‐\nties of the questionnaire are not provided.\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in Children and Adolescents154\n3.2. Knowledge of Attention Deficit Disorder Questionnaire (Riley, 1994) [26]\n3.2.1. Description and development\nThis is an instrument drawn up in the United States and in the English language to investi‐\ngate teachers’, counselors’ and principals’ knowledge of ADHD in school age children. The\ninstrument has two sections. The first is made up of six items that gather information of a\nsocio-demographic character (sex, training, education experience, etc.) and a second made\nup of 35 items which evaluates participants’ knowledge of ADHD. The 35 items were taken\nfrom the DSM-III: 15 related to Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD), 11 related to diagnostic\ncriteria for Conduct Disorder (CD) and 9 that deal with Oppositional Defiant Disorder\n(ODD). Participants are asked to identify the 15 statements that best characterize children\nwith ADHD with an X marking the space before each statement.\nThe instrument was applied to a stratified sample of 303 participants in the Kansas School\ndistrict: 160 teachers, 61 principals and 82 counselors. 91 were male and 212 female. Hardly\nany other information is given about the sample.\n3.2.2. Scoring standards\nCorrect answers to the items received 1 point, while the rest of the answers received 0\npoints. Thus, the possible scores ranged from 0, for the lowest level of knowledge, to 15, for\nthe highest.\n3.2.3. Psychometric properties\nNo publications have been found which provide validity evidences or reliability indices.\n3.2.4. Strengths and weaknesses\nThis is a simple and easy instrument to apply. The problem is that the response format is\nsimilar to the dichotomous one and respondents can try to guess the right answer. Further‐\nmore, the psychometric properties of the instrument are not known.\n3.3. ADHD Knowledge Questionnaire (Barbaresi & Olsen, 1998) [21]\n3.3.1. Description and development\nThis is an instrument developed in the United States and in the English language in order to\nexamine the effectiveness of a training program on ADHD given to infant and primary\nschool teachers. The questionnaire is based on the items produced by Jerome et al. [ 23] and\nconsists of two sections: A first socio-demographic section and a second section consisting of\n27 items that assess teachers’ knowledge regarding ADHD. The response format of the in‐\nstrument is dichotomous (True, False), and includes positive and negative items (the au‐\nthors do not specify the number of positive and negative items).\nReview of Tools Used for Assessing Teachers’ Level of Knowledge with Regards Attention Deficit Hyperactivity\nDisorder (ADHD)\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/54277\n155\nThe questionnaire was administered to 44 teachers, of whom 33 were women and 11 men.\nThe mean age of participants was 42 years, and they had an average of 15 years of teaching\nexperience. 66% were ordinary classroom teachers while the remaining 34% were specialists\n(art, music, physical education, etc.). They had an average of 24 students per teacher. 77%\nhad not received any training on ADHD while being trained as teachers and 27% had re‐\nceived no training in the subject after completion of their studies.\n3.3.2. Scoring standards\nCorrect answers received a score of 1 and incorrect ones 0. Thus, the possible scores ranged\nfrom 0, for the lowest level of knowledge, to 27, for the highest.\n3.3.3. Psychometric properties\nNo publications have been found which provide validity evidences or reliability indices.\n3.3.4. Strengths and weaknesses\nThis is a simple and easy instrument to apply. However, the sample is very small and the\ndichotomous response format (True/False) places limits on the possibility of assessing the\nreal level of knowledge of the teachers as the absence of a third (Don’t Know) option invites\nrespondents to guess the right answer. Furthermore, the psychometric properties of the in‐\nstrument are not known.\n3.4. The Knowledge of Attention Deficit Disorders Scale (KADDS)\n3.4.1. Original version of The Knowledge of Attention Deficit Disorders Scale (KADDS) (Sciutto,\nTerjesen & Bender, 2000) [5]\n3.4.1.1. Description and development\nIt was developed in the United States and in the English language. This is one of the most\nwidely used instruments to assess the level of knowledge of teachers regarding ADHD, and\nis the first instrument whose indices of reliability and validity were published in this field. It\nconsists of 36 items, 18 positive and 18 negative, and measures three areas of knowledge re‐\nlated to ADHD: 1) Symptoms/Diagnosis of ADHD (9 items), 2) General information on the\nnature, causes and impact of ADHD (15 items), and 3) Treatment of ADHD (12 items). It has\na three option response format (True, False, Don’t Know), which allows it to overcome the\nlimits of previously used dichotomous formats (True, False) and collect more detailed infor‐\nmation about the knowledge of teachers with respect to ADHD. The use of the three option\nresponse format allows the authors to discern those areas in which teachers have more\nknowledge, areas where they have the least knowledge and the areas in which they commit\nthe greatest number of errors.\nIn the drawing up of the items the authors strove to include only those with the support of\nthe scientific literature, citing references for each item in the manual accompanying the in‐\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in Children and Adolescents156\nstrument. They also sought to include positive and negative aspects relating to ADHD, and\npositive and negative statements in nature.\nOnce they had drawn up the items the authors contacted a group of 40 students working for\ndoctorates in clinical and child psychology. The participants, based on the three sub-scales\nprovided by the authors, had to assign each item to one of the sub-scales provided. An item\nwas considered as belonging to a particular sub-scale if at least 75% of the group was in\nagreement with the decision.\nThe authors then conducted a series of preliminary investigations to explore the reliabili‐\nty coefficients of the instrument. They administered an instrument of 27 items with a di‐\nchotomous response format (True, False) to 73 teachers of kindergartens and elementary\nschools [27] and obtained a Cronbach’s alpha  of 0.38 for the total scale. In a subsequent\nstudy they modified the items that had an inadequate item-total correlation and incorpo‐\nrated the three option (True, False, Don’t Know) response format. The resulting scale was\nadministered to 46 undergraduate and graduate education students and the overall alpha\ncoefficient obtained for this version was 0.71 [27]. Several items were reformulated and 9\nnew items were included in the final version of the instrument which now had 36 items\nand which Bender [28] administered to 63 prospective elementary teachers, obtaining a\ncoefficient alpha of 0.81.\nFinally, Sciutto et al. [ 5] administered the resulting 36 item scale along with a socio-demo‐\ngraphic questionnaire (age, sex, teaching experience, teaching speciality, etc.) and a scale of\nseven points dealing with respondents’ self-perception of their effectiveness as teachers of\nchildren with ADHD to a broader sample. 149 primary school teachers from six public\nschools participated in the validation of the instrument. The sampling procedure is not ex‐\nplained. There were 134 female and 9 male participants; the sex of six participants was not\ngiven. Their average age was 41 years ( SD=11.43) and they had an average of 12.57 years of\nexperience as teachers ( SD=8.06). 19% of the sample were special needs teachers and 37%\nsaid they had done special needs teaching at some point. 79% of participants had a Master’s\ndegree, whereas the other 21% reported having a Bachelor’s degree. With regard to ADHD,\n52% of the teachers said that had taught at least one pupil who had been diagnosed with\nthis condition.\nIt is worth pointing out that Sciutto and Terjesen [29] carried out an additional study on\nprimary school teachers and university students in the state of Ohio to expand the relia‐\nbility and the evidence of validity of KADDS. This study has not been published and no\nmore data is available about the sample. However, the authors refer to this study along\nwith the study Sciutto, Nolfi & Bluhm [30] carried out on primary school teachers with\nthe KADDS manual.\n3.4.1.2. Scoring standards\n1 point was given for correct answers and 0 for incorrect ones and gaps in knowledge. Thus,\nthe possible scores ranged from 0, for the lowest level of knowledge, to 36, for the highest.\nReview of Tools Used for Assessing Teachers’ Level of Knowledge with Regards Attention Deficit Hyperactivity\nDisorder (ADHD)\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/54277\n157\n3.4.1.3. Psychometric properties\nFor reliability analysis, internal consistency was first calculated, producing a Cronbach’s al‐\npha of 0.71 for each sub-scale and 0.86 for the scale as a whole. Furthermore, it was also seen\nthat each KADDS sub-scale had a high correlation with the total KADDS score (range r=0.85\nto r=0.91) and that there was a correlation between the three sub-scales (range r=0.63 to\nr=0.69). In order to analyze the stability of the scale, Sciutto and Terjesen [ 29] administered\nthe KADDS in two occasions to a group of 185 university students (what they were students\nof is not stated) leaving an interval of two weeks between one application and the other. The\ntest-retest correlations for the KADDS scores range between r=0.59 and r=0.70 for the three\nsub-scales and were r=0.76 for the scale as a whole.\nNo test was carried out on the factorial structure of the instrument. In order to find evidence\nof validity, the correlations between the scale scores and a series of variable related to the\nconstruct to be measured were examined. With regard to the previous exposure of teachers\nin their classrooms to pupils diagnosed with ADHD, statistically significant differences were\nfound in the KADDS scores obtained (p<0.01), as well as in various sub-scales (p<0.01 for the\nGeneral information and Symptoms/Diagnosis sub-scales). The same occurred with the uni‐\nversity students who knew a person with ADHD. In the KADDS and the Treatment sub-\nscale they achieved significantly higher scores ( p<0.01) than those that had no contact\nwhatever with people with ADHD [ 29]. Furthermore the authors of the KADDS have point‐\ned out that the scores obtained by the teachers on the scale correlated in a statistically signif‐\nicant and positive way with the number of ADHD students that had in their classes ( r=0.23,\np<0.01 for the New York sample and r=0.31, p<0.01 for the Ohio sample in the KADDS total)\n[5, 30]. In this case, the same phenomenon also occurred with the university students that\nhad some kind of contact with people with ADHD ( r=0.18, p<0.01 for the KADDS total) [ 29].\nFinally, they found that people with more information about ADHD had higher KADDS\nscores, both in the case of teachers ( r=0.40, p<0.001 for the KADDS total) [ 30] and in the case\nof university students (r=0.36, p<0.001 for the total KADDS score) [29].\n3.4.1.4. Strengths and weaknesses\nConsidering that the validation of the KADDS was carried out mainly based on the study of\nSciutto et al. [5], it should be emphasized that the sample used is fairly small in size and geo‐\ngraphically homogenous. Furthermore, the specific data from the Ohio sample are not\nknown [29].\nThe reliability of the KADDS was analyzed satisfactorily. As to evidence of validity, we be‐\nlieve that it could be improved but this is understandable considering it was the first instru‐\nment constructed to assess knowledge of teachers regarding ADHD whose psychometric\nproperties have been published. The authors provide information on content validity,\nthanks to which it is known that they tried to be careful in their selection of test items but\nthey do not provide detailed information about the construction of the instrument (number\nof items initially created, etc.), and the panel of experts consulted in the process for getting\ncontent validity was fairly homogeneous (students in the same doctoral program). Further‐\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in Children and Adolescents158\nmore, there is no factorial analysis which would justify the sub-scales defended by the au‐\nthors of the KADDS.\nIn any case we regard the instrument developed by Sciutto et al. [ 5] to be a significant refer‐\nence point for any researcher trying to create one with a similar purpose because it was a\npioneering effort in the field with good reliability and sufficient external validity. As well as\nthat, it is an instrument that is easy to answer due to its brief and precise instructions, its\nsmall size and its three option response format. It is also worth mentioning that it has a sim‐\nple scoring system and thanks to the aforementioned response format, it provides informa‐\ntion regarding the knowledge, false beliefs and areas of lack of knowledge of the teachers,\ninformation which the previous instruments, with their dichotomous response format, could\nnot provide.\n3.4.2. The Spanish version of The Knowledge of Attention Deficit Disorders Scale (KADDS) (Jarque,\nTárraga & Miranda, 2007) [4]\n3.4.2.1. Description and development\nThis is the Spanish adaptation of the KADDS [ 5]. Like the original instrument it has 36\nitems, 18 positive and 18 negative, and it measures three areas of knowledge related to\nADHD: 1) Symptoms/Diagnosis of ADHD (9 items), 2) General information on the nature,\ncauses and impact of ADHD (15 items), and 3) Treatment of ADHD (12 items). The three\noption response format (True, False, Don’t Know) is the same as that of the original instru‐\nment and it has a more extensive socio-demographic section than the original instrument\n(age, sex, years of experience as a teacher, teaching speciality, etc.).\nIn the first phase of the adaptation process of the instrument, two doctoral students in devel‐\nopmental and educational psychology translated KADDS into Spanish making the adjust‐\nments required for the new socio-cultural context. After that, native speakers of English\ntranslated the text back into English to test the validity of the original translation. In this sec‐\nond phase the authors found 18 words different from the original version and agreed on a\nfinal version of the translation of those words and drew up initial version of the instrument.\nThe initial version was sent to 15 experts in ADHD (ADHD researchers and educational\npsychologists) who were asked to place each of the items on one of the three sub-scales that\nmake up the instrument. The level of agreement on the assignment of items to the sub-scales\nwas 94%. Finally, a pilot study was conducted on a sample of 35 primary school teachers\nwho were asked to reply to the scale and indicate errata, difficulties to understand expres‐\nsions or doubts that may have arisen during completion of the questionnaire. Corrections\nwere made and the final version was thus produced.\nFor the analysis of reliability and validity of the final version of the instrument, the authors\ncontacted various public and subsidized schools in the province of Valencia. The sampling\nwas not random. The Spanish version of the KADDS was administered to 193 teachers, 68\nfrom infant education and 125 from primary education, of whom 130 were women and 43\nmen (20 teachers did not specify their sex). They had a mean age of 42 years ( SD=11.40), and\nan average of 17 years of teaching experience ( SD=12.03). 13.8% were special education\nReview of Tools Used for Assessing Teachers’ Level of Knowledge with Regards Attention Deficit Hyperactivity\nDisorder (ADHD)\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/54277\n159\nteachers. 51.6% had received specific training on ADHD, with an average of 7.80 hours\n(SD=17) training. In addition, 59.1% of the teachers had had some experience teaching chil‐\ndren with ADHD, and the average number of children with ADHD that they had in their\nclassrooms during the previous two school years was 1.39 (SD=1.89).\n3.4.2.2. Scoring standards\nIdentical to KADDS [5].\n3.4.2.3. Psychometric properties\nThe reliability of the scale, measured by the Cronbach’s alpha coefficient showed adequate in‐\nternal consistency. The alpha coefficient ranged between 0.74 and 0.77 for the three sub-\nscales and was 0.89 for the total scale. These rates were higher than those obtained by\nSciutto et al. [5] in the original instrument. In addition, each of the sub-scales showed a high\ncorrelation with the total scale score (range r=0.85 to r=0.90), and there also was correlation\nbetween the three sub-scales (range r=0.62 to r=0.69). These data are also consistent with\nthose provided by Sciutto et al. [5]. There was no test-retest reliability check conducted.\nThe validity of the scale was studied using a series of Pearson correlations between teacher\nknowledge of ADHD and various socio-demographic variables, specifically, teachers’\nknowledge of ADHD correlated in a statistically significant way with the number of hours\nof training they had received, r(152)=0.17, p=0.036; with the number of children with ADHD\nthey had taught, r(180)=0.29, p=0.001; with the number of courses during which they had\nchildren with ADHD in their classes, r(172)=0.23, p=0.002; and their self-perceived level of\neffectiveness as teachers of children with ADHD, r(179)=0.50, p=0.001.\n3.4.2.4. Strengths and weaknesses\nThe sample used for the KADDS adaptation was quite small and geographically homogene‐\nous. Also, test-retest reliability was not checked and the factorial structure of the scale was\nnot analyzed. Apart from these weaknesses and those mentioned in the original version of\nKADDS, it should be noted that the instrument has adequate internal consistency and some\nevidence of external validity.\n3.5. Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Knowledge and Opinion Survey (AKOS-\nIV) – Knowledge Scale (Power & Rostain, 2003) [31]\n3.5.1. Description and development\nThis instrument was developed in the United States in the English language and consists of\n21 items, 8 positive and 13 negative with a dichotomous response format (True, False). The\nlead author of AKOS-IV participated in the development of different versions of the instru‐\nment. The first version was designed to analyze the level of knowledge among parents re‐\ngarding ADHD [see 32]. There is a lack of published information about the second version.\nThe third version was used to assess the level of knowledge that teachers of primary and\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in Children and Adolescents160\nsecondary education have regarding ADHD [ 33], and the fourth and final version [ 31] has\nnot been published, so its target population is unknown.\n3.5.2. Scoring standards\n1 point was given for correct answers and 0 for incorrect ones and gaps in knowledge. Thus,\nthe possible scores ranged from 0, for the lowest level of knowledge, to 21, for the highest.\n3.5.3. Psychometric properties\nNo publications have been found which provide validity evidences or reliability indices.\n3.5.4. Strengths and weaknesses\nOn the positive side, it should be noted that the questionnaire is short and simple to com‐\nplete, but it uses a response format with two options (True, False) which can lead to a bias in\nthe collection of information as those subjects who did not know what to answer are re‐\nquired to choose one of the two alternatives provided. In addition, there is a lack of publish‐\ned information relating to the development of the instrument and its psychometric\nproperties.\n3.6. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Stimulant Medication Survey (Snider,\nBusch & Arrowood, 2003) [34].\n3.6.1. Description and development\nThis is an instrument developed in the United States in the English language and it is aimed\nat primary school and special education teachers. Its aim is to test their knowledge of the\nnature of ADHD and its treatment through stimulant medication. The questionnaire is div‐\nided into six sections. The first consists of 8 socio-demographic items: The number of stu‐\ndents the teacher has, the number of students diagnosed with ADHD, years of teaching\nexperience, etc. The second section is made up of 47 Likert scale items with 5 options\n(1=Strongly Disagree, 2=Disagree; 3=Neutral/Don’t know, 4=Agree, 5=Strongly Agree) divid‐\ned into three blocks: A first block of 13 items to assess factual knowledge about ADHD and\nthe use of stimulant medication, a second block of 23 items that asked participants to indi‐\ncate their views about the effects of stimulant medication on classroom behavior, and a third\nblock of 11 items assessing teachers’ experience and involvement with students who have\nADHD. In the third section the subjects have to state which sources they regard as most reli‐\nable for obtaining information about ADHD. In the fourth section they had to state which\npeople usually recommend that children suspected of having ADHD be evaluated by. In the\nfifth section the teachers are asked about what teaching techniques they have most frequent‐\nly used for dealing with children with ADHD. In the sixth and final section, there is an open\nquestion which enquires about teachers’ opinions regarding the use of stimulant medication\nfor the treatment of students with ADHD.\nReview of Tools Used for Assessing Teachers’ Level of Knowledge with Regards Attention Deficit Hyperactivity\nDisorder (ADHD)\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/54277\n161\nThe pilot version was administered to 15 teachers participating in a graduate clinical experi‐\nence at the University of Wisconsin. Small changes were made in the wording of the items\nand it was confirmed that the time required to respond to the questionnaire was about 10 to\n15 minutes.\nThe definitive version of the questionnaire was administered to 145 teachers in Wisconsin,\n29 women and 116 men. The subjects were randomly chosen from the Department of Public\nInstruction. Among the participants 43% were special education teachers and 30% general\neducation teachers. The teachers had an average of 16.5 years of teaching experience\n(SD=9.46).\n3.6.2. Scoring standards\nNot provided.\n3.6.3. Psychometric properties\nNo publications have been found which provide validity evidences or reliability indices.\n3.6.4. Strengths and weaknesses\nOn the positive side, it should be noted that this is a questionnaire with clear instructions\nand is easy to fill out. However, the response format used by the authors (Likert 5 options)\nmay complicate the interpretation of the results, since it offers the option to partially agree\nor disagree with the questionnaire items. Moreover, the sample used for the application of\nthe instrument was small and geographically homogeneous, and the psychometric proper‐\nties of the instrument are not known. Finally, it should be noted that one of the main objec‐\ntives of the questionnaire was to analyze teachers' knowledge of stimulant medication, a\nvery specific purpose and one distinct from the object of study of the other questionnaires\nthat have been examined in this chapter.\n3.7. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Questionnaire (Kos, Richdale &\nJackson, 2004) [20]\n3.7.1. Description and development\nThis instrument was drawn up in Australia in the English language to test the perceived and\nreal knowledge of primary teachers and trainee teachers of ADHD. Section b) of the ques‐\ntionnaire was drawn up to examine this main point and contains some items from Jerome et\nal. [23], Sciutto et al. [ 5] and another series of items taken from the scientific literature relat‐\ned to ADHD. The instrument was made up of 131 items divided into six sections. Section a)\ncollects information on socio-demographic aspects of the sample and included an analog\nscale of 10 cm on which respondents had to indicate what they thought they knew about\nADHD. The bottom end of this scale indicates the minimum level of knowledge (Very Lit‐\ntle), while the upper level indicates the maximum level (A Lot). Section b) includes 27 items,\n11 positive and 16 negative, with a three option response format (True, False, Don’t know)\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in Children and Adolescents162\ndrawn up to assess respondents real knowledge of ADHD. Section c) has a focus on identi‐\nfying the teaching strategies which subjects might use with pupils with ADHD. For this pur‐\npose they were given a brief description of a practical case and a series of multiple choice\nand open questions. Section d) collects information about participants’ beliefs about ADHD\nand the possibility of having pupils with it in their classes. For this purpose it had 31 items\nwhich required a response on an analog scale of 10 cm the bottom of which indicated com‐\nplete agreement with the statement (Strongly Agree) and the top of which indicated com‐\nplete disagreement (Strongly Disagree). Section e) was designed to evaluate beliefs\nregarding the different strategies for action possible in classes with pupils with ADHD. It\nhas 56 items divided into various sub-sections to which respondents had to respond on 10\ncm analogical scales the bottom ends of which indicated complete agreement (Strongly\nAgree) and the upper ends of which indicated complete disagreement (Strongly Disagree).\nFinally, section f) includes two multiple choice items to which subjects have to respond re‐\ngarding whether or not they want more training on ADHD and to specify the way they be‐\nlieve most appropriate to find out more about ADHD.\nThe questionnaire was revised by two educational and developmental psychologists not as‐\nsociated with the study. It was later piloted on a sample of 9 primary school teachers from\nVictoria (Australia), arising from which no change was made. The questionnaire was finally\nadministered to 120 primary school teachers in Victoria, 91 women and 29 men with an\naverage age of 39.2 years ( SD=10.2), and 45 students in the last year of their education de‐\ngree, all women and with an average age of 23.6 years ( SD=5.6). The sampling procedure\nwas not explained.\n3.7.2. Scoring standards\nSection b) of the questionnaire had 27 items. Correct responses received a score of 1 and incor‐\nrect ones, 0. Thus, the possible scores ranged from 0, for the minimum level of knowledge, to\n27, for the maximum level. The scoring standards for the other sections were not given.\n3.7.3. Psychometric properties\nNo publications have been found which provide validity evidences or reliability indices.\n3.7.4. Strengths and weaknesses\nOn the positive side, it should be noted that the authors have attempted to develop an in‐\nstrument that collects a variety of information relating to ADHD. However, the instrument\nhas many weaknesses: The sample used is quite small and geographically homogeneous, the\ninformation given relating to the development of the instrument is scant, the presentation of\nthe items and response formats vary from one section to another, and there are questions\nwith 34 possible answers and analog scales of 10 cm which make it difficult to interpret the\nresponse provided by the subject. In short, it is a long and complex questionnaire for the\nsubject. Additionally, the psychometric properties are not known.\nReview of Tools Used for Assessing Teachers’ Level of Knowledge with Regards Attention Deficit Hyperactivity\nDisorder (ADHD)\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/54277\n163\n3.8. Knowledge of ADHD Rating Evaluation (KARE) (Vereb & DiPerna, 2004) [35]\n3.8.1. Description and development\nThis instrument was developed in the United States and in the English language. Its pur‐\npose is to analyze the knowledge that elementary school teachers have about ADHD and\nassess their level of acceptance with respect to the medication and behaviorist treatments\nthat are used with children with ADHD. The instrument is divided into three sections.\nThe first section collects socio-demographic data. The second section consists of 43 items,\npositive and negative in nature (the authors do not specify the number of each), and is\ndivided into two sub-scales: A first sub-scale assesses knowledge of the etiology, symp‐\ntoms  and  prognosis  of  ADHD  (31  items),  and  a  second  sub-scale  assesses  knowledge\nabout treatments that are used most frequently in ADHD cases (12 items). The third and\nfinal section consists of 10 items divided into two sub-scales: The first sub-scale assesses\nthe level of acceptance that subjects presented with respect to medication (5 items), and\nthe second sub-scale assesses the level of acceptance of the behavioral intervention guide‐\nlines used with children with ADHD (5 items). The second section of the instrument has\na response format of three options (True, False, Don’t Know) and the third section, being\nan opinion section, has a Likert-type response format of 4 options (1=Not at all Likely,\n2=Somewhat Likely, 3=Moderately Likely, 4=Very Likely).\nThe preliminary version of the instrument was made up of 59 items. 20 experts, members\nof  the  International  Society  for  Research  in  Child  and  Adolescent  Psychopatology  who\nhad conducted research in the area of ADHD and/or treatment acceptability were called\nupon to revise it. The items that received a negative evaluation from these experts were\nmodified or removed.\nFinally, the study was carried out on 47 elementary school teachers in five different districts\nof Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The sampling procedure was not specified. 94% of the\nsample was female and had an average of 13 years of teaching experience ( SD=8.76). 85% of\nthe teachers were general teachers, while 4.35% worked in special education and 10.6%\nworked in both areas.\n3.8.2. Scoring standards\nIn the second section of the instrument 1 point was given for correct answers and 0 for in‐\ncorrect ones and gaps in knowledge. Thus, the possible scores ranged from 0, for the lowest\nlevel of knowledge, to 43, for the highest. The scoring standards for the third section of the\nquestionnaire are unknown.\n3.8.3. Psychometric properties\nFor the reliability analysis, the internal consistency was first calculated, obtaining a Cron‐\nbach’s alpha  coefficient that ranged from 0.58 (Knowledge of treatments sub-scale) to 0.81\n(Behavioral management acceptability sub-scale) for the four sub-scales in the questionnaire.\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in Children and Adolescents164\nIn order to analyze the stability of the instrument, the authors administered the KARE a sec‐\nond time to a sample of 24 subjects (without further details being given of the sample) with\na time interval of four weeks between the first and the second administration. The test-retest\nreliability ranged from 0.76 (Behavioral management acceptability sub-scale) to 0.80 (Medi‐\ncation acceptability and Knowledge of treatment sub-scales).\nNo publications have been found which provide validity evidences.\n3.8.4. Strengths and weaknesses\nOn the positive side, it should be noted that this is a not too long instrument with response\nformats that are easy to fill out. It also has an acceptable internal consistency for three of the\nfour subs-scales that compose it, and has good test-retest stability. However, the sample\nused for obtaining the reliability indices is small, and no published validity evidences of the\ninstrument have been found.\n3.9. Educator ADHD knowledge (Niznik, 2004) [36]\n3.9.1. Description and development\nThis instrument was drawn up in the United States in the English language. The main pur‐\npose of it is to assess the level of knowledge of elementary school teachers regarding ADHD\nbefore and after they received a specific training program on the subject. The instrument\nconsists of 23 items and has a multiple choice format: Each item is followed by five possible\nanswers, one correct and four distractors.\nIn the course of its development process, the instrument was administered to 10 doctors\nworking as psychologists in the Cypress-Fairbanks school district (Texas) to receive their\nfeedback. Adjustments have been made for a better understanding of the items and re‐\nsponse options (the authors did not provide further details). The test authors also conducted\na pilot study with 133 participants (no further description were given of the sample), as a\nresult of which a number of items were removed.\nThe resulting instrument was administered to 47 elementary school teachers in the Cypress-\nFairbanks school district. 91.5% of the participants were female and 8.5% male. 55.3% of\nthem were general teachers while 44.7% were special education teachers. The age of the\nteachers ranged from 18 upwards, and they had an average of 11 years teaching experience.\n30% of the sample had never received training about ADHD, and 95.7% had a child in their\nclassroom with the disorder diagnosed in recent years.\n3.9.2. Scoring standards\n1 point was given for each correct answer so the possible scores ranged from 0, for the low‐\nest level of knowledge, to 23, for the highest level.\nReview of Tools Used for Assessing Teachers’ Level of Knowledge with Regards Attention Deficit Hyperactivity\nDisorder (ADHD)\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/54277\n165\n3.9.3. Psychometric properties\nThe reliability of the instrument was calculated using the Kuder-Richardson formula 20, and a\nreliability of 0.65 was obtained. No publications have been found that provide validity evi‐\ndences.\n3.9.4. Strengths and weaknesses\nOn the positive side, it should be noted that this is a not too long instrument with a novel\nresponse format in the field that concerns us. However, the authors provide few details\nabout the construction process of the test, the sample that has been used with the final in‐\nstrument is quite small and homogeneous, and has a low reliability index. Furthermore, the\nvalidity evidences of the instrument were not provided.\n3.10. The knowledge about Attention Deficit Disorder Questionnaire (KADD-Q) (West,\nTaylor, Houghton & Hudyma, 2005) [6]\n3.10.1. Description and development\nThis is an instrument that was drawn up in Australia in the English language in order to\nassess the knowledge about ADHD of primary and secondary teachers and parents of chil‐\ndren with the same condition. It consists of a scale of 67 items, constructed on the basis of 20\nitems from the KADDS [ 5]. It has a three option response format (True, False, Don’t Know)\nand measures three areas of knowledge connected to ADHD: 1) Causes of ADHD, 2) Char‐\nacteristics of ADHD, and 3) Treatment of ADHD. Like the KADDS scale it has positive and\nnegative items, and for the drawing up of which the authors made efforts to use only those\nitems with support in the scientific literature.\nThe KADD-Q authors obtained the sample needed for the analysis of reliability and validity\nof the scale by making a random selection of schools in metropolitan Perth (Western Aus‐\ntralia) and by way of the Centre for Attention and Related Disorders of The University of\nWestern Australia. The sample consisted of 348 participants: 256 teachers (51% primary and\n43% secondary) and 92 parents. Of the teachers involved in the sample, 22% were male and\n78% female. 180 teachers were recruited in their workplaces and had an average of 20.2\nyears ( SD=10.3) of teaching experience, the remaining 76 teachers were recruited through\nthe Centre for Attention and Related Disorders, and had an average amount of teaching ex‐\nperience of 15.8 years ( SD=10). 96% of teachers said they had a student with ADHD in the\nclassroom at some point and 20% were qualified in special education. As for the group of 92\nparents participating in the study, it should be noted that 8% were male and 92% female. In\naddition, the average age at which their child had been diagnosed with ADHD was 10.3\nyears (SD=3.1). 23% of the parents were attending a support group for parents of children\nwith ADHD and 31% had attended informational seminars about ADHD in the preceding\n12 months.\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in Children and Adolescents166\n3.10.2. Scoring standards\nIn the SPSS statistical package correct answers were coded with a 1, incorrect ones with a 0,\nand the gaps as a missing value. Possible answers ranged from 0, for the minimum level of\nknowledge, to 67, for the maximum level.\n3.10.3. Psychometric properties\nThe reliability of the KADD-Q and its sub-scales was estimated using Cronbach’s alpha coeffi‐\ncient. The results suggest that the internal consistency of the KADD-Q is high for the sample\nof teachers ( alpha=0.91) and parents ( alpha=0.93). For the sub-scales Causes, Characteristics\nand Treatment, alphas obtained were of 0.86, 0.80 and 0.79 for teachers and 0.85, 0.84 and\n0.84 for the parents, respectively. In addition, each of the sub-scales of the KADD-Q had a\nhigh correlation with the total scale score (range r=0.73 to 0.92) in both the sample of teach‐\ners and parents. There were moderate correlations between the three sub-scales of teachers\nin the sample (range r=0.34 to 0.56), and somewhat ones higher in the sample of parents\n(range r=0.56 to 0.77). There was no test test-retest reliability conducted.\nConvergent validity was not evaluated, nor was any test of the factorial structure of the in‐\nstrument made. The scale authors present data on a series of relationships that exist between\nthe scale scores and several variables related to the construct they purport to measure,\nwhich provide certain information concerning the external validity. The level of teachers’\nknowledge about ADHD was significantly higher depending on the stage of their profession\nthey were at. Primary school teachers obtained higher scores than their secondary education\ncolleagues ( p=0.001). Teachers who had attended to professional development sessions\nabout ADHD in the previous 12 months and those who had specific training in special edu‐\ncation had higher scores on the scale (p<0.001 and p=0.024, respectively).\n3.10.4. Strengths and weaknesses\nOn the positive side, it is noteworthy that the authors of KADD-Q have tried to create a sin‐\ngle instrument to assess the knowledge of teachers in primary and secondary education and\nthe parents of children with ADHD. This instrument has an easily completed response for‐\nmat and has good internal consistency. However, the teachers and parents samples used for\nthe study were small and geographically homogeneous, the information relating to the de‐\nvelopment of the instrument is scant, the instrument lacks test-retest reliability indices, evi‐\ndence of convergent validity is not provided, and nor is there any factorial analysis to\nconfirm the presence of the three sub-scales of the instrument. To all this must be added the\nfact that data concerning the external validity of the instrument are scarce.\n3.11. Teacher knowledge about ADHD (Jones & Chronis-Tuscano, 2008) [24]\n3.11.1. Description and development\nThis instrument was drawn up in the United States and in the English language for the pur‐\npose of assessing teachers’ knowledge of ADHD after they have receiving training related to\nReview of Tools Used for Assessing Teachers’ Level of Knowledge with Regards Attention Deficit Hyperactivity\nDisorder (ADHD)\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/54277\n167\nit. It consists of 25 items with a dichotomous response format (True, False). The items were\ndesigned to cover six areas of content: 1) Causes of ADHD, 2) Assessment of ADHD, 3)\nADHD sub-types, 4) Associated problems of ADHD, 5) Treatment of ADHD, and 6) Specific\nschool-based behavioral strategies for children with ADHD.\nThe questionnaire was administered to a non-random sample of 142 elementary school\nteachers in the Washington DC metropolitan area, of whom 74 belonged to the experimental\ngroup receiving training in ADHD and the remaining 68 to a control group that did not re‐\nceive such training. The average age of all participants in the sample was about 37 years\n(SD=12.45) and they had an average amount of teaching experience of 11.34 years\n(SD=10.40). 92% were women and only 17% were special education teachers. Approximately\n34% of the sample had had experience of a child with ADHD in their classroom.\n3.11.2. Scoring standards\n1 point was given for correct answers and 0 for incorrect ones, so the range of possible\nscores went from 0, for the lowest possible level, to 25, for the highest possible level.\n3.11.3. Psychometric properties\nInternal consistency scores were 0.68 and 0.97 before and after training, respectively. No\npublications have been found which provide validity evidences of the instrument.\n3.11.4. Strengths and weaknesses\nOn the positive side, it should be noted that the questionnaire is short and easy to fill out.\nHowever, it uses a dichotomous response format which prevents information being collect‐\ned about the areas where the teachers’ lack of knowledge is concentrated. Furthermore, in‐\nformation about the validity of the instrument is not available.\n3.12. Questionnaire to Assess Teachers' Knowledge about ADHD\n3.12.1. Basque language version of the Questionnaire to Assess Teachers’ Knowledge about ADHD\n(Irakasleek AGHNari buruz duten ezagutza ebaluatzeko galdera-sorta – IRA-AGHN) (Soroa,\nBalluerka & Gorostiaga, unpublished)\n3.12.1.1. Description and development\nThis is a newly developed questionnaire produced in Spain in the Basque language and\nwhich has yet to be published. Its purpose is to assess the knowledge of infant and primary\nschool teachers about ADHD. It is divided into two sections. The first collects socio-demo‐\ngraphic data (age, sex, teaching speciality, teaching experience, etc.) as well as data on the\nperceived knowledge of teachers of ADHD and their perceived capacity to teach children\nsuffering from this condition. The second section assesses their real knowledge of these mat‐\nters with 26 items that use a three option response format (True, False, Don’t Know). The\nquestionnaire items, 21 positive and 5 negative, assessed four areas of knowledge related to\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in Children and Adolescents168\nADHD: 1) General information about ADHD (4 items), 2) Symptoms/Diagnosis of ADHD\n(11 items), 3) Etiology of ADHD (4 items), and 4) Treatment of ADHD (7 items). The ques‐\ntionnaire items were developed from an extensive review of the literature on ADHD.\nTo obtain data on content validity, the authors of the instrument sought the cooperation of 8\nexperts in ADHD (university lecturers from different fields of knowledge and clinical or ed‐\nucational psychologists). Thanks to their participation the initial questionnaire of 105 items\nwas reduced to 76 which were distributed into their corresponding sub-scales of the ques‐\ntionnaire when there was an agreement level of 70% among the experts. Subsequently, a pi‐\nlot study was conducted on 98 infant and primary school teachers in the Autonomous\nCommunity of the Basque Country and Navarre. 83 participants were women and 15 men,\nwith a mean age of 40 years ( SD=9.8). They had an average of 15 years ( SD=10) in the teach‐\ning profession, 50.5% had never received training about ADHD, and 47% said they had ex‐\nperience of having a child with ADHD in their classroom. 86% were infant education\nspecialists or primary teachers and 8% were special education teachers. Thanks to the partic‐\nipation of these teachers, the authors of the questionnaire selected those items with high dis‐\ncrimination power and revised the wording of 6 statements, obtaining a preliminary\ninstrument of 51 items.\nThe draft instrument was finally applied to a sample of 752 infant and primary education\nteachers in 84 schools in the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country and Navarre.\nThe schools were randomly selected. 86% of participants were female and 14% male, with a\nmean age of 42 years ( SD=9.68). They had an average of 17 years ( SD=10.55) experience as\nteachers, 80% were infant and primary teachers and 12% special education teachers. 59%\nsaid they never received training about ADHD, and 54% stated that they had had experi‐\nence of children with ADHD during their careers. The final instrument of 26 items as descri‐\nbed earlier in this section was thus obtained.\n3.12.1.2. Scoring standards\n1 point was given for each correct answer and 0 for incorrect ones and gaps in knowledge.\nThus, the possible scores ranged from 0, for the minimum level of knowledge, to 26, for the\nhighest level.\n3.12.1.3. Psychometric properties\nWith the purpose of selecting the final items for the IRA-AGHN, a factor analysis with obli‐\nque rotation was carried out. Items with a factor loading equal to or greater than .35, and\nwhich adequately reflected the underlying construct, were selected. Using the 26 selected\nitems, the dimensionality of the instrument was examined by means of an exploratory factor\nanalysis based on polychoric correlations. The Unweighted Least Squares (ULS) estimation\nmethod was used. Kaiser procedure was used to decide the number of factors, and the Di‐\nrect Oblimin rotation method was selected in order to simplify the factor structure. The re‐\nsulting structure confirmed the multi-dimensional character of the construct. Four factors\nwere obtained which explained 53.2% of the variance: The first factor, Etiology of ADHD,\nReview of Tools Used for Assessing Teachers’ Level of Knowledge with Regards Attention Deficit Hyperactivity\nDisorder (ADHD)\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/54277\n169\nexplained 29.15% of the variance; the second factor, Symptoms/Diagnosis of ADHD, ex‐\nplained 9.8% of the variance; the third factor, General information about ADHD, explained\n7.8% of the variance; and the fourth and final factor, Treatment of ADHD, explained 6.4% of\nthe variance.\nFor the reliability analysis, the internal consistency was first calculated, with an Omega coef‐\nficient which ranged from 0.76 to 0.90 being obtained for the four sub-scales. For the pur‐\npose of analyzing the stability of the instrument the authors administered the IRA-AGHN a\nsecond time to a sample of 123 teachers with a period of four weeks between the first and\nsecond administration. The Spearman’s Rho test-retest correlations for the IRA-AGHN scores\nranged from r=0.49 to r=0.77 (p<0.01) for the four sub-scales.\nConvergent validity was tested by comparing the results obtained by the subjects in the\nIRA-AGHN with the results obtained in the Spanish version of the KADDS [ 4]. The correla‐\ntion between the scores obtained by the subjects in the dimensions shared by both question‐\nnaires was r=0.54 for the General information sub-scale, r=0.45 for the Symptoms/Diagnosis\nsub-scale and r=0.33 for the Treatment sub-scale (p<0.01 in all cases).\nFinally, to obtain evidence of external validity, the relationships between the scores obtained\nby the participants in the IRA-AGHN sub-scales and a series of variables related to the con‐\nstruct that it was sought to measure were examined. The data showed that the scores ob‐\ntained by the teachers in the Symptoms/Diagnosis sub-scale had a moderate correlation with\nvariables such as the number of children diagnosed with ADHD the teachers had taught in\nthe course of their careers ( r = .29, p = .001), the teachers’ perceived knowledge of ADHD ( r\n= .37, p = .001), and the teachers’ perceived capacity to teach effectively children with ADHD\n(r = 0.30, p = 0.001). Meanwhile, it was observed that the scores obtained by the teachers in\nthe General information sub-scale showed a moderate correlation with the teachers’ per‐\nceived knowledge of ADHD variable (r = .30, p = .001). In addition, using the Mann-Whitney\nU test a comparison was drawn between the average score ranges obtained by teachers who\nhad taught children diagnosed with ADHD in the course of their careers and those who\nhadn’t. Results showed that there were statistically significant differences between the\ngroups’ mean score ranges in the Symptoms/Diagnosis sub-scale ( Mann-Whitney U test  =\n44503; p = .0001; r = .29).\n3.12.1.4. Strengths and weaknesses\nOn the positive side, it should be noted that this is a short questionnaire and easy to com‐\nplete with a three option response format (True, False, Don’t Know), and that it success‐\nfully  evaluates  teachers’  knowledge,  false  beliefs  and  areas  of  lack  of  knowledge\nregarding ADHD. The sample used for the validation of the instrument is geographically\ndiverse and extensive, being representative of the target population for the questionnaire.\nThe  instrument  development  process  was  thorough  and  rigorous,  and  has  appropriate\npsychometric properties, although evidence of external validity is not supported by high\nlevels of correlation.\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in Children and Adolescents170\n3.12.2. Spanish version of the Questionnaire to Assess Teachers’ Knowledge about ADHD\n(Cuestionario para evaluar el conocimiento de los maestros acerca del TDAH – MAE-TDAH) (Soroa,\nBalluerka & Gorostiaga, unpublished)\n3.12.2.1. Description and development\nThis is a questionnaire recently produced in Spain in the Spanish language and which has\nyet to be published. The description is the same as that for the above mentioned version of\nthe instrument in the Basque language.\nTo obtain evidence of content validity, the authors of the instrument sought the cooperation\nof 8 experts in ADHD (university lecturers from different fields of knowledge, child and\nyouth psychiatrists, pediatricians, one educational psychologist and one education expert\nwho are members of various associations of families of children with ADHD). Thanks to\ntheir participation, the initial questionnaire of 105 items was reduced to 76 items that were\ndistributed in the corresponding sub-scales of the questionnaire with the agreement of at\nleast 70% of the judges. Subsequently, a pilot study was conducted on 68 infant and primary\nschool teachers in the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country and Navarre. 53 par‐\nticipants were women and 15 men, with a mean age of 43 years ( SD=10.87). They had an\naverage of 18 years ( SD=11.67) in the teaching profession, 47% had never received training\nregarding ADHD, and 73% said they had a child diagnosed with ADHD in their classroom\nat some point in their career. 73% were infant or primary school teachers, and 15% were spe‐\ncial education teachers. Thanks to the participation of these teachers, the authors of the\nquestionnaire selected those items with high discrimination power and revised the wording\nof two of the statements, obtaining a preliminary instrument of 51 items.\nFinally, the draft instrument was applied to a sample of 526 infant and primary school\nteachers in 57 schools in the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country and Navarre.\nThe schools were randomly selected. 85% of participants were female and 15% male, with a\nmean age of 43 years ( SD=10.89). They had an average of 17 years ( SD=11.31) experience as\nteachers, 77% were infant or primary teachers and 11% were special education teachers. 56%\nsaid they had never received training regarding ADHD, and 67% stated that they had a\nchild diagnosed with ADHD in their classroom at some point in their career. From this\nstudy the final 26 items instrument was obtained.\n3.12.2.2. Scoring standards\nIdentical to those in the Basque language version of the questionnaire.\n3.12.2.3. Psychometric properties\nWith the aim of selecting the final items for the MAE-TDAH, a factor analysis with oblique\nrotation was carried out. Items with a factor loading equal to or greater than .35, and which\nadequately reflected the underlying construct, were selected. Using the 26 selected items,\nthe dimensionality of the instrument was examined by means of an exploratory factor analy‐\nsis based on polychoric correlations. The Unweighted Least Squares (ULS) estimation meth‐\nReview of Tools Used for Assessing Teachers’ Level of Knowledge with Regards Attention Deficit Hyperactivity\nDisorder (ADHD)\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/54277\n171\nod was used. Kaiser procedure was used to decide the number of factors, and the Direct\nOblimin rotation method was selected in order to simplify the factor structure. The resulting\nstructure confirmed the multi-dimensional character of the construct. Four factors were ob‐\ntained which explained 60.73% of the variance: Etiology of ADHD explained 34.04% of the\nvariance, General information about ADHD explained 12.14% of the variance, Treatment of\nADHD explained 8.92% of the variance, and the fourth and final factor, Symptoms/Diagno‐\nsis of ADHD, explained 5.6% of the variance.\nFor reliability analysis, the internal consistency was first calculated and an Omega coefficient\nwhich ranged from 0.83 to 0.91 for four sub-scales was obtained. In order to analyze the sta‐\nbility of the instrument, the authors administered the MAE-TDAH a second time to a group\nof 112 teachers four weeks after the first application. The Spearman’s Rho test-retest correla‐\ntions for the MAE-TDAH scores ranged from r=0.62 to r=0.79 (p<0.01) for the four sub-scales.\nConvergent validity was tested by comparing the results obtained by the subjects in the\nMAE-TDAH with the results obtained in the Spanish version of KADDS [ 4]. The correla‐\ntions observed between the scores obtained by the subjects in the dimensions shared by both\nquestionnaires were r=0.58 for the General information sub-scale, r=0.43 for the Symptoms/\nDiagnosis sub-scale, r=0.30 for the Etiology and r=0.39 for the Treatment sub-scale ( p<0.01 in\nall cases).\nIn order to find evidence of external validity the authors of the MAE-TDAH examined the\ncorrelations between the questionnaire scores and a series of variables related to the con‐\nstruct it was sought to measure. Significant statistical differences were found between the\nteachers’ perceived knowledge of ADHD and the scores they obtained for all the sub-scales\nof the questionnaire ( r=0.38 for General information, r=0.37 for Symptoms/Diagnosis, r=0.30\nfor Etiology and r=0.31 for Treatment; p=0.001 for all cases), as well between the teachers\nperceived capacity to effectively teach children with ADHD and the scores obtained in the\nsub-scales General information and Symptoms/Diagnosis of ADHD ( r=0.29, p=0.001 and\nr=0.30, p=0.001, respectively).\n3.12.2.4. Strengths and weaknesses\nThese are similar to those set out regarding the Basque language version of the question‐\nnaire. The main difference is that in this case the sample used for the validation of the ques‐\ntionnaire was quite homogenous as it was confined to two autonomous communities of the\nSpanish state.\n4. Conclusions\nIn the review that has been carried out in this chapter, it has been observed that there exist a\ngreat number of tools that have been developed to assess the level of knowledge of teachers\nregarding ADHD. However, most of them do not have good psychometric properties. The\nauthors of this chapter consider necessary to develop and validate instruments with psycho‐\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in Children and Adolescents172\nmetric properties to measure teachers’ knowledge of ADHD with rigor. These instruments,\nin addition to identifying gaps in teachers’ knowledge of the disorder, can be useful in rais‐\ning the awareness of teachers about the need for more training in this area, help in the de‐\nsign of training tailored to the needs of teachers, and ultimately, promote the welfare of\nchildren and young people with ADHD.\nThis lack of methodological rigor in these measurement instruments may cause the obtain‐\ning of erratic and false results. With regard to the measurement instruments used to assess\nteachers’ knowledge of ADHD it can be seen that this knowledge varies among the studies\nexamined here. This variability may, in part, be due to an increase in teachers’ knowledge of\nADHD over recent decades but it might also be due to methodological reasons such as the\nfollowing: The number and content of the items in the various instruments varies; the re‐\nsponse formats also differ and this affects the results; the size of the samples also varies con‐\nsiderably, in some cases being very big and in others quite small; different studies have\ncollected different socio-demographic data from their sample, which affects the description\nmade of it and the interpretations which might be made of the reasons for the knowledge\nteachers have about ADHD. All these aspects should be taken into account when it comes to\ninterpreting, comparing and generalizing the results obtained from these instruments.\nRegarding the dimensionality of the instruments analyzed here, it should be noted that five\nof the twelve (KADDS [ 4, 5], KARE [ 35], KADD-Q [ 6], Teacher Knowledge About ADHD\n[24], and IRA-AGHN/MAE-TDAH) used a number of dimensions ranging from 2 to 6 for\nthe assessment of teachers knowledge of ADHD. It can be seen that Treatment is the only\ncommon to all the instruments. In general, the various dimensions proposed by the authors\ndeal with the symptoms, sub-types, associated problems, evaluation, prognosis and etiology\nof ADHD. However, it should be noted that only one of the instruments reviewed, the IRA-\nAGHN/MAE-TDAH conducted a factor analysis to confirm the multidimensional nature of\nthe construct.\nFurthermore, the external validity of the instruments analyzed provides information about\nthe variables that can influence the knowledge that teachers have regarding ADHD. Three\nof the twelve instruments reviewed (KADDS [ 4, 5], KADD-Q [ 6], and IRA-AGHN/MAE-\nTDAH) provide evidence of external validity. If we focus on those variables that have rela‐\ntionships with knowledge about ADHD with effect size equal to or greater than 0.30 in any\nof the instruments, it can be concluded that the variables that correlated with teachers’\nknowledge about ADHD are: Prior exposure of teachers to children diagnosed with ADHD\nin the classroom, the number of children with ADHD teachers have had in their classrooms,\nhaving had specific training about ADHD, the degree of teachers’ self-perceived efficacy in\nteaching children with ADHD and teachers’ self-perceived knowledge of ADHD.\nFinally, it should be pointed out that we consider the present chapter to be of interest be‐\ncause it provides an exhaustive review of the main instruments identified in the scientific\nliterature to assess teachers’ knowledge of ADHD. The identification of instruments with\noptimal psychometric properties is fundamental because it allows for the obtaining of valid\nand reliable data about the construct being studied. With regard to teachers’ knowledge of\nADHD it has been shown that there exist a significant percentage of teachers with gaps in\nReview of Tools Used for Assessing Teachers’ Level of Knowledge with Regards Attention Deficit Hyperactivity\nDisorder (ADHD)\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/54277\n173\nthis area [3-7, 19, 20]. For this reason, we believe that the use of instruments which measure\nthis knowledge with rigor could contribute to devising of training materials and courses ap‐\npropriate for the needs of teachers. And this would, of course, result in benefits for the chil‐\ndren who suffer from this condition.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors appreciate the cooperation of all those authors who provided additional infor‐\nmation about the assessment instruments examined in this chapter.\nThis work was partially funded by a grant from the Research Bureau of the University of the\nBasque Country UPV/EHU (General Funding for Research Groups, GIU11/29).\nAuthor details\nMarian Soroa1, Arantxa Gorostiaga2 and Nekane Balluerka2\n*Address all correspondence to: marian.soroa@ehu.es\n1 Developmental and Educational Psychology Department, University Teacher Training\nCollege of Donostia of the UPV/EHU, Donostia-San Sebastián, Spain\n2 Social Psychology and Methodology of the Behavioral Sciences Department, Psychology\nFaculty of the UPV/EHU, Donostia-San Sebastián, Spain\nReferences\n[1] Lavigne, R. & Romero, J.
