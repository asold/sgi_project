  "abstract": "Power transformer is the most important and expensive equipment used in the electric power industry. Fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors has stood out as a flexible and particularly suitable tool for power transformer monitoring being a passive and dielectric sensor element. In this work we evaluated the performance of FBG pressure sensors developed to monitor the static and dynamic pressure in high voltage winding transformers during events such as short-circuit and inrush current. Two types of sensors packaging materials were evaluated in laboratory: polyether ether ketone (PEEK) and transformerboard (TB). The sensors have been tested for high intensity and short duration impacts similar to those occurring in short circuits. In addition, we evaluated the time response of sensors using an interrogation system with a 5 kHz sweep in order to analyze the short circuit response time properly. The results pointed that FBG pressure sensors using PEEK and TB are suitable for transformer winding monitoring. The static sensitivity obtained to PEEK based sensors was 0.911 pm/N, in the range of 800 N to 1500 N. This sensitivity is 4.47 higher than TB based sensors sensitivity. Dynamical tests performance showed an excellent repeatability for both sensors, in agreement with static observation.",
