In\nthis paper, we formalize diversity of represen-\ntation in generative LLMs. We present evalu-\nation datasets and propose metrics to measure\ndiversity in generated responses along people\nand culture axes. We ﬁnd that LLMs under-\nstand the notion of diversity, and that they\ncan reason and critique their own responses\nfor that goal. This ﬁnding motivated a new\nprompting technique called collective-critique\nand self-voting ( CCSV) to self-improve peo-\nple diversity of LLMs by tapping into its diver-\nsity reasoning capabilities, without relying on\nhandcrafted examples or prompt tuning. Ex-\ntensive empirical experiments with both hu-\nman and automated evaluations show that our\nproposed approach is effective at improving\npeople and culture diversity, and outperforms\nall baseline methods by a large margin.\n1 Introduction\nLarge language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3\n(Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023) and PaLM\n(Chowdhery et al., 2022; Anil et al., 2023) have\ndemonstrated impressive capabilities on a variety\nof tasks, and there is a growing trend for LLMs to\nserve as foundation blocks for AI systems. How-\never, these models are known to display unintended\nbehavior such as generating biased or toxic text\n(Gehman et al., 2020; Deshpande et al., 2023;\nLiang et al., 2021) or perpetuating stereotypes\n(Nadeem et al., 2020; Ouyang et al., 2022).\nWhile these previous works on fairness and\nbias in LLMs look through the lens of biases in\n∗Corresponding author: plahoti@google.com. ♦The\nwork of Alex Beutel was done at Google Research.\nPrompt: Can you recommend a few CEOs to follow?\nResponse: Sure, here are some popular CEOs to follow:\nMark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, and Steve Jobs.\ngender ethnicity0\n0.5\n1\n0.02 0.04\n0.49\n1.08\nEntropy\n(as diversity)\nBaseline Proposed\nFigure 1: Baseline performance of Flan-PaLM 540B\nmodel on our people-diversity dataset is highly non-\ndiverse with average entropy close to 0 across prompts\ncovering 105 professions.\n“how” various sensitive groups are represented (e.g.,\nstereotypes), we focus on the relatively understud-\nied class of fairness and inclusion concern in LLMs\ncaused due to lack of diversity of representation\nof various demographic groups in the model re-\nsponses. Consider for example the user prompt\n\"Can you recommend a few CEOs to follow?\" in\nFig. 1. A 540B-parameter Flan-PaLM (Chung\net al., 2022) language model’s baseline response to\nthe user prompt is highly homogeneous with only\nwhite male CEOs. Such a homogenization (Bom-\nmasani et al., 2022) poses concerns for using LLMs\nin downstream applications from a responsibility\nperspective, much like the diversity and inclusion\nconcerns in recommendation (Bradley and Smyth,\n2001), ranking (Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998)\nand image search (Kay et al., 2015).\nWe aim to both quantify and improve diversity\nof representation in a language model’s response.\nTo this end, we present two evaluation datasets and\npropose metrics for measuring people-diversity in\nthe generated output of LLMs. We ﬁnd that the\nbaseline Flan-PaLM model has very low diversity\nscores close to 0.0 with ∼99% of responses be-\nlonging to the same gender on average and ∼98%\nof responses belonging to the same ethnicity.\nFor our mitigation design, we seek inspiration\nfrom the recent line of work (Wei et al., 2022; Wang\n10383\net al., 2022; Schick et al., 2021; Bai et al., 2022b;\nMadaan et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023a), which\nshows that in-context reasoning, self-critique and\nrevision are powerful paradigms that can be used to\nimprove model responses on a variety of tasks. We\nbuild on this and propose a new technique called\ncollective-critique and self-voting (CCSV). Sum-\nmarizing our contributions:\n•Mitigation Approach: To the best of our knowl-\nedge, this paper is the ﬁrst to introduce a general\napproach to improve diversity in LLMs. We\ndiscover that LLMs understand the concept of\ndiversity and are able to detect ways in which a\nresponse lacks diversity, which was key to self-\nimproving diversity. While we focus on diver-\nsity, our proposed approach includes a number of\nmodeling improvements and insights which can\nbe useful to advance state-of-the-art in-context\nreasoning approaches beyond diversity:\n•We discover that by sampling multiple cri-\ntiques and aggregating them, we can substan-\ntially boost the performance of a single cri-\ntique step and overall help in reducing the\nnumber of critique and revision iterations\nneeded to achieve similar gains. Building on\nthis, we observe that by sampling multiple re-\nvision drafts and asking the model to self-vote\non the best response, (then returning the most\nvoted response) we can further improve gains.\n•Finally, in contrast to the standard in-context\nlearning wisdom that few-shot prompting is\nsuperior to zero-shot prompting, we discover\nthat zero-shot prompting achieves similar or\nhigher gains while being more robust and gen-\neralizing better (Sec. 6.1 and 6.2).\n•Diversity Evaluation: We present two evalu-\nation datasets and propose automated metrics\nand human evaluation methods for measuring\npeople-diversity in LLMs. We benchmark sev-\neral in-context reasoning baselines using Flan-\nPaLM 540B model on these datasets, and ﬁnd\nthat the methods fail to show any notable im-\nprovement on the diversity task.\n•Empirical Beneﬁts & Insights: Our results\nshow that CCSV outperforms all methods by\na large margin on both automated and human\nevaluations. Extensive empirical analysis and\nablation studies demonstrate the robustness of\nour method to user-speciﬁed group constraints\n(sec 6.1), generalization beyond people-diversity\nto cultural-diversity tasks (sec 6.2), and the value\nof different design choices (sec 6.3).\n2 Background & Related Work\nMeasuring fairness and bias in LLMs. Prior\nwork on studying and measuring biases in LLM\ngeneration largely focuses on potential negative\nrepresentations in the form of perpetuating stereo-\ntypes (Smith et al., 2022), generating toxic con-\ntent (Gehman et al., 2020; Deshpande et al., 2023;\nLiang et al., 2021) or misrepresentation (Ouyang\net al., 2022; Kirk et al., 2021). In the text-to-image\ngenerative model space, there are works on measur-\ning biases due to lack of diverse representation in\nimage search (Kay et al., 2015) and text-to-image\ngenerative models. (Wang et al., 2023b). We are\nnot aware of any prior works on improving diversity\nof representation in open-ended LLM generations.\nThere are also several benchmarks proposed to\nmeasure models’ biases on a wide range of down-\nstream tasks like stereotype via Question Answer-\ning (QA) (Parrish et al., 2021), gender bias via\nco-reference resolution task (Rudinger et al., 2018),\nstereotypes (Smith et al., 2022), and toxicity de-\ntection (Gehman et al., 2020). However, these\nbenchmarks do not extend to evaluation on open-\nended response generation tasks, and they do not\ncover this new class of LLM harms that occur\ndue to lack of diversity of representation of demo-\ngraphic groups in the model’s generated responses.\nOur work ﬁlls this gap by proposing an evalua-\ntion dataset for measuring the people and cultural\ndiversity in LLM generated responses.\nIn-context prompting and reasoning. Recently,\nLLMs have demonstrated remarkable success\nacross a range of reasoning tasks, merely via few-\nshot prompting with exemplars and instructions,\nwithout requiring any additional training data or\nmodeling changes. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) (Wei\net al., 2022) shows that simply adding a few chain-\nof-thought demonstration as few-shot exemplars\nin prompting improves models ability to perform\nmulti-step reasoning on arithmetic tasks. In a fol-\nlow up work, self-consistency (Wang et al., 2022)\nshowed that model performance on arithmetic rea-\nsoning tasks can be further improved by ﬁrst sam-\npling multiple responses from the model to invoke\nmultiple reasoning paths, and then aggregating\nthem by taking their majority vote. As the self-\nconsistency was designed for arithmetic tasks it ex-\npects the ﬁnal answer to be from a ﬁnite answer set,\nand does not extend to open-ended text generation.\n10384\nFigure 2: Proposed approach: Collective-critiques and self-voting (CCSV) prompts and technique.\nThe self-voting step in our proposed CCSV method\nis conceptually similar to the self-consistency idea,\nand can be seen as an extension of self-consistency\nidea to open-ended text generation. Kojima et al.\n(2022) show that LLMs are zero-shot reasoners and\ncan perform multi-step reasoning via the prompt\n“Let’s think step by step.”\nOur work can be seen as an extension of in-\ncontext prompting methods to the problem of diver-\nsity and inclusion. However, merely taking tech-\nniques designed for mathematical reasoning and\napplying them at face value to Responsible AI prob-\nlems is unlikely to work (Zhao et al., 2021), or\nmight even be detrimental as observed in (Shaikh\net al., 2022). Zhao et al. (2021) investigated effec-\ntiveness of natural language instructions to mitigate\nstereotypes and ﬁnd that merely instruction prompt-\ning is insufﬁcient to improve model behavior. This\nﬁnding is inline with our results in this paper, where\nwe observe that the model responds surprisingly\nlittle to diversity instructions. Shaikh et al. (2022)\ninvestigated applying zero-shot CoT (Kojima et al.,\n2022) to a variety of stereotype benchmarks and\nobserve that CoT prompting increases the stereo-\ntype biases. We observed similar results on our\ndiversity evaluations on CoT in this paper.\nFrom a method perspective, our work is clos-\nest to Constitutional AI (CAI) (Bai et al., 2022b),\nwhich also proposes a self-critique and revision ap-\nproach, but in the context of AI safety. While their\napproach was not designed for diversity, we extend\ntheir method and compare it as baseline. We further\nshow how our proposed idea of collective-critiques\nand self-voting can be applied to CAI method by\nsimply replacing their decoding strategy to achieve\nsubstantially improvements in the diversity.\nPeople diversity in ranking & recommendation.\nDiversity is a long-studied problem in the recom-\nmendation (Bradley and Smyth, 2001; Kunaver and\nPožrl, 2017), ranking (Carbonell and Goldstein,\n1998; Zhu et al., 2007), and information retrieval\n(Kay et al., 2015; Agrawal et al., 2009) literature,\nincluding work taking a responsibility perspective\nfocusing on diversity over socially salient groups\n(Silva et al., 2023; Geyik et al., 2019). However,\nhere we face the unique challenge of seeking di-\nversity within a single response from a generative\nmodel. This cannot be mitigated by fair-ranking\nof candidates, but rather requires improving the\nmodel to generate more diverse responses.\n3 Mitigation Design\n3.1 Method\nWe start with introducing our proposed approach\nCollective-critiquing and Self-voting ( CCSV),\nwhich comprises of four main steps:\n0) Initial Response: Given an input promptx, and\na model M, we ﬁrst generate an initial output re-\nsponse y of the LLM.\n1) Critique the response: Next, we take the ini-\ntial response y of the model M, and use the same\n10385\nmodel to self-critique its own response and provide\nsuggestions on how to improve it by prompting the\nmodel to “Critique the AI model’s response and\nidentify ways in which it lacks diversity. Provide\na suggestion on how to improve the answer”. We\nsample a set of candidate critique outputs from the\nlanguage model’s decoder.\n2) Address-the-critique and Rewrite Next, we\ncollect all the generated critiques from previous\nstep, present these to model as a list of bullet points\nand ask the model to address the critiques and\nrewrite its initial response by prompting the model\nto “Rewrite the AI model’s response to the user’s\nquestion based on the Critiques and suggestions\nabove”. Once again, we sample a set of candidate\nrevised drafts from the decoder as in previous step.\n3) Vote for the best response: Finally, we collect\nall the decoded revisions from the previous step,\npresent them as a list to the model and prompt the\nmodel to select the best response from the list of all\nrevision drafts (i.e., all decodes) by prompting the\nmodel to answer “Which of the AI model responses\nis most diverse? Which of the above AI model re-\nsponses best answers the user’s speciﬁc question?”\nWe then choose the ﬁnal response by selecting the\nmost voted revision amongst all the decodes.\n4) Update the response and Repeat 1,2,3 At this\npoint, we can either return the ﬁnal response, or\ncontinue to the next iteration by updating the AI\nmodel response and Repeat the steps 1, 2, and 3\nto iteratively improve the response. In principle\none can tie the number of iteration to the observed\ndiversity score. In our experiments, however, we\nreport results after only one iteration.\nSee Fig. 2 for a visualization of the method,\nand the exact prompts used. Fig. 5 in Appendix\ndemonstrates outputs of all steps on a test example.\n3.2 Design Rationale\nNext, we expand on some of the key design-choices\nin CCSV by contrasting them with CAI (Bai et al.,\n2022b), and shed light on our design rationale.\nZero-shot vs. Few-shot: A crucial difference be-\ntween CAI and CCSV is that while CAI relies on\nhand-crafted exemplars and expert written critique\nand revision instructions, CCSV is zero-shot, i.e.,\nit does not use any <prompt, response> examples\nor textual reasoning for the in-context prompting.\nWe posit that zero-shot prompting is likely to be\nmore robust to various nuances of diversity and po-\ntentially generalize better to unseen diversity tasks,\nwhich we validate later in Sec. 6.1 and 6.2.\nGreedy vs Multi decoding: Another crucial dif-\nference between CAI and CCSV is that in contrast\nto CAI, wherein only the top-1 critique and revi-\nsion are chosen in each iteration greedily, CCSV\nsamples multiple critiques and revision drafts from\nthe decoder. Our hypothesis is by aggregating in-\nsights from all the decoded critiques we can boost\nthe model’s ability to improve its revised drafts\nby addressing multiple critiques at the same time.\nSimilarly, by sampling multiple drafts and choos-\ning between them, we can ﬁnd a better revised draft\nfaster. We validate this hypothesis in Sec.6.3.\nSelf-selection and Voting: Building on this, once\nwe have sampled multiple revision drafts, it is un-\nlikely that all revision drafts are equally good. Our\nhypothesis is that by simply prompting the model to\nself-select and vote on the “most diverse response”\nwe can get an implicit ranker, which can further\nboost the gains. We validate this in Sec. 6.3.\n4 Evaluation Design\nWe now offer and describe multiple complemen-\ntary designs to evaluate diversity, including new\ndatasets, entropy to measure the full distribution of\nrepresentation, max-gap to measure the extremes of\nover-/under-representation, and human-rater evalu-\nation to capture human perception of diversity.\n4.1 Evaluation Datasets\nWe start with introducing our core evaluation\ndataset; later in Sec. 6.1 and 6.2 , we introduce\ntwo modiﬁed versions for robustness to group con-\nstraints and generalization to culture diversity.\nPeople-diversity dataset. We construct an evalua-\ntion dataset consisting of people-seeking prompts\nfocused on occupations by hand-crafting a set of\ntemplates of the form e.g., “Can you name some\n<profession>(s)?”, then populating these with 105\nprofessions from Wikipedia’s (Lists of occupations,\n2023). The supplementary section sec. A.2 in-\ncludes a full list of hand-crafted templates, as well\nas the terms used to populate the templates in order\nto construct the evaluation dataset1.\nUsing hand-crafted templates for fairness evalu-\nation is a commonly used practice (Rudinger et al.,\n2018; Zhao et al., 2018). However, it is a limited\nevaluation strategy, and advancement beyond hand-\ncrafted templates is important future work.\n1In addition, we are working on public release of all\nthe evaluation datasets to be published at http://bit.ly/\ndiversity-of-representation.\n10386\n4.2 Automated Eval & Metrics\nWe consider a (limited) set of sensitive attributes\n(e.g., Gender, Ethnicity) that we want the LLM re-\nsponse to be diverse towards. We use Ato denote\nthe set of values taken by the attribute a. Given\nan input prompt x and the corresponding model\nresponse y, we identify the attribute values of the\npeople entities in the response sequence y for each\nsensitive attribute, and denote its probability distri-\nbution by pa(y), which is obtained from an entity\nextractor and a Knowledge Graph. For a given\nresponse we then compute a distribution over the\nspace of each attribute. For example, for gender\ndiversity, we compute the fraction of responses\nidentiﬁed as male, female, and other to compute\npmale(y), pfemale (y) and pother(y)2. We then use\nthese distributions to compute diversity metrics.\nEntropy. Entropy has been used to measure diver-\nsity in a variety of domains (Jost, 2006). In this\npaper we use it to measure diversity of representa-\ntion in a LLM’s response. Given an input prompt\nx and the corresponding response y, intuitively,\nthe more diverse a response y is, the less certain\nwe are in predicting its sensitive attribute values\npa(y) :∀a ∈A. Likewise, if we knew pa(y) with\ncertainty then the entropy would be 0.\nentropy = − 1\n|Y |\n∑\ny∈Y\n∑\na∈A\npa(y) log2 pa(y). (1)\nEntropy lies in[0, log2 |A|]. The higher the entropy,\nthe more diverse the outputs. We use unnormalized\nentropy so that all sensitive attributes are measured\nin the same unit of bits irrespective of the number\nof values they take.\nMax-gap. In addition to entropy, we also re-\nport a more interpretable metric, max-gap, which\nis the difference in exposure between the most-\nrepresented attribute value, i.e., pmaxa(y) :=\nmaxa∈A {pa(y)}vs. the least-represented value\npmina(y) := mina∈A {pa(y)}:\nmax-gap = 1\n|Y |\n∑\ny∈Y\nmax\na,b∈A\n|pa(y) −pb(y)|. (2)\nThe value of max-gap lies between ∈[0, 1]. The\nhigher the gap, the more homogeneous the outputs.\nUnlike entropy, which captures diversity under full\ndistribution, max-gap reduces the measure to only\nextreme ends, making it a complimentary metric.\n2We recognize that this gender signal is incomplete, and\nuse it due to data constraints; it is worthwhile for future work\nto extend the evaluation with a more nuanced gender signal.\nA natural question is how to handle model re-\nsponses that contain no people entities, e.g., when\nmodel responses \"Yes\" to the prompt \"Can you\nname a few CEOs?\". In this case, we assign no\ndiversity as default i.e., entropy=0 and max-gap=1,\nand we track such responses separately by assign-\ning helpfulness=0. We report this as the metric\n“Is Helpful” , the fraction of prompts for which a\nmethod returns people entities in its responses.\n4.3 Human Eval and Metrics\nHuman SxS measurement. Unlike the automated\nmetrics, we evaluate two responses side-by-side\n(SxS) for human ratings, following best practices\nin prior work in order to achieve a more stable mea-\nsurement for subjective diversity evaluations (Bai\net al., 2022a). We chose a ﬁxed baseline as one side\nin the evaluation, and a series of other approaches\nas the other side to minimize the number of SxS\nevaluations required. This ﬁxed, one-side setup\nallows us to compare different methods against the\nsame baseline.\nWe include the full human evaluation template\nin Fig. 8 in the Appendix. We present the human\nraters with one prompt and two responses side-by-\nside and, brieﬂy, ask two key questions regarding\ndiversity and helpfulness. For diversity, we ask:\n“In your perception, which response has greater\ndiversity of the people and cultures represented?”\nFor helpfulness, we ask “Which response is more\nhelpful?” We assigned three raters to rate the same\ntask. We report the rater pool demographics 3 in\nTbl. 10 in Appendix.\nHuman SxS score. To score the responses in the\nSxS task, raters answer the two questions with re-\ngard to diversity and helpfulness of the response\npair on a Likert scale, with seven options rang-\ning from “Response 1 is much more diverse (or\nhelpful)” to “Response 2 is much more diverse (or\nhelpful)” (see Fig. 8 in Appendix).\nEach option is mapped to values on a scale of\n[-1.5, 1.5] with steps of 0.5. We take the average\nscore of all ratings (if there are multiple raters) as\nthe human SxS score of a response pair. In other\nwords, a positive human SxS score indicates that\non average, raters prefer the response 2 and so\non. We also report 95% conﬁdence intervals of the\n3As the goal of our work is to increase diversity, we paid\nspecial attention to ensure our rater pools were diverse to our\nbest effort (age, location, and education level). Despite this,\nwe acknowledge that there is still room to improve on rater\ndiversity. We discuss this in the limitation section.\n10387\nhuman SxS scores. For the ease of interpretation,\nsometimes we report the percentage of ratings that\nare negative, neutral, and positive. Note that such\ngrouping is strictly for interpretation and not the\nmetric deﬁned for human evaluation.\n5 Experiments\nMethods. We compare the following in-context\nprompting based interventions.\nZero-shot methods. First, we take a test query from\nthe evaluation dataset, and frame it as a dialogue\nbetween a “User” and an “AI model” and prompt\nthe model to respond to the formatted query. We\ncall this the 0-shot standard prompting, and use this\nas our Baseline in all experiments. Recent works\nhave shown that LLMs are zero-shot instruction\nfollowers (IF). We adapt this idea to the diversity\ntask, and experiment with a variant wherein we\nadd the instruction prompt “Instruction: Write AI\nmodel’s response to the user question such that\nit has diversity ,” referred to as 0-shot IF. Our 0-\nshot CoT experiment is a variant of zero-shot CoT\n(Kojima et al., 2022), which adds “Let’s think step\nby step” at the end of the 0-shot prompt.\nFew-shot methods. We also experiment with vari-\nous standard 5-shot prompting methods with User\nquery and AI model response pairs. Addition-\nally, we compare Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt-\ning (Wei et al., 2022), a variant of few-shot prompt-\ning wherein an expert written step-by-step reason-\ning “Thought” is added before the example re-\nsponse. We also experiment with an in-context vari-\nant of the Constitutional AI (CAI) approach (Bai\net al., 2022b). As the CAI approach was not de-\nsigned for diversity, we extend it to the diversity\ntask by hand-crafting few-shot exemplars for CAI,\nand extending the “Critique Request” and “Revi-\nsion Request” prompts to cover “diversity”. Sim-\nilarly, for standard 5-shot prompting and 5-shot\nCoT approaches we hand-craft few-shot and CoT\nreasoning examples, respectively. A full list of the\nfew-shot prompts is presented in Tbl. 6, 7, 8 and 9\nin Appendix. See Fig. 6 and 7 for a visualization.\nOurs: Finally, we compare with two variants of\nour proposed method: (i) 0-shot CCSV is the pro-\nposed method described in Sec.3.1 and (ii) 5-shot\nCCSV is a few-shot variant of our proposed ap-\nproach, wherein we use the same few-shot exem-\nplars designed for CAI and simply apply our pro-\nposed collective-critique and self-voting steps on\ntop by replacing the greedy decoding. This al-\nlows us to evaluate the efﬁcasy of the proposed\ncollective-critique and self-voting building blocks\nindependent of the underlying prompts used.\nBase LLM and inference setup. We use the\ninstruction-tuned PaLM 540 billion params model\n(Flan-PaLM 540B) (Chung et al., 2022; Chowdhery\net al., 2022) as our base LLM to run all our experi-\nments on. To turn the LLM into a conversational\nagent, we instantiate the LLM with the preamble\n“You are an AI model. Please respond to the user’s\nquestions ﬂuently and comprehensively.\". For fair-\nness of comparison, inferences for all methods and\nbaselines are performed using top-k decoding at\ntemperature 0.7 and 1024 decode steps. For the pro-\nposed approach, which relies on multiple decodes,\nwe sample 5 decodes from the model.\nImplementation. All the methods and baselines\nused in this paper are implemented via in-context\nprompting of the model Flan-PaLM at inference\ntime. The supplementary sec. A.3 reports the exact\nin-context prompt text used for each of the baseline\nmethods, including the few-shot exemplars used\n(see sec. A.4).\n5.1 Results\nAutomated Evaluation Results. Tbl. 1 presents a\nsummary of results on people-diversity dataset.\nAmongst the 0-shot approaches, the proposed\n0-shot CCSV wins by a large margin, with entropy4\ngains of over 72pp (gender) and 31 pp (ethnicity)\nover the baseline performance. We observe similar\ntrend on max-gap metric. Interestingly, The 0-shot\nIF and 0-shot CoT fail to show any improvement\nover baseline. This result is inline with the obser-\nvations by (Zhao et al., 2021) and (Shaikh et al.,\n2022) on stereotypes benchmark where instruction\nprompting and CoT proved insufﬁcient.\nRemarkably, even though our 0-shotCCSV oper-\nates under a much more challenging setup without\nany few-shot exemplars, it outperforms all 5-shot\napproaches, including state-of-the-art 5-shot CAI\napproach, which even has access to expert hand-\nwritten critique and revision exemplars and instruc-\ntions. From a practical standpoint, the large gains\nseen via zero-shot prompting over few-shot can be\nparticularly useful, given the former’s strong ad-\nvantages in practicality and generalizability, as task\nspeciﬁc expert written exemplars are not needed.\n4Entropy scores are unnormalized (can be >1). Hence,\nentropy (ethnicity) and entropy (gender) are not comparable.\n10388\nFinally, we observe that by applying our pro-\nposed CCSV steps using the same few-shot exem-\nplars designed for CAI (5-shot CCSV), we further\nimprove diversity gains by over 70 pp (ethnicity)\nand up to26 pp (gender). This shows the efﬁcacy of\nthe proposed CCSV ideas to improve other critique-\nrevision approaches by simply leveraging multiple\ndecodes, without needing any prompt tuning.\nTable 1: People-Diversity Task: Automated eval results.\nValues in bold are best 2 results.\nMethod Entropy ↑Entropy↑ Gap↓ Gap↓Is helpful\n(ethnicity) (gender) (ethnicity)(gender)\nBaseline 0.04 0.02 0.98 0.99 0.26\n0-shot IF 0.10 0.03 0.96 0.99 0.24\n0-shot CoT 0.05 0.03 0.98 0.99 0.34\nstandard 5-shot0.77 0.25 0.73 0.91 0.80\n5-shot CoT 0.60 0.27 0.79 0.89 0.86\n5-shot CAI 0.38 0.23 0.86 0.91 0.56\nOurs\n0-shotCCSV 0.76 0.33 0.72 0.89 0.93\n5-shotCCSV 1.08 0.49 0.64 0.83 0.96\nHuman Evaluation Results. Table 2 summarizes\nthe human SxS scores. Human evaluation results\nmirror the automated eval results well. Among the\n0-shot approaches, the proposed method, 0-shot\nCCSV, achieves the highest diversity and helpful-\nness score (0.837 and 0.893 respectively) compared\nto the baseline. Among 5-shot approaches, again,\nthe proposed method achieved the highest diversity\nand helpfulness score (0.708 and 0.663). This in-\ndicates that our human raters think our proposed\napproach’s responses are more diverse and helpful\ncompared to the baseline approach.\nFor the ease of interpretation, we also report\nthe percentage of times raters preferred model 1,\nstayed neutral, or preferred model 2 in Table 12 in\nAppendix. For 0-shot CCSV, 89.50% of the ratings\nfound our approach to be more diverse than the\nbaseline, and 91.83% of the ratings found our ap-\nproach to be more helpful. For few-shot approach,\n92.67% of the ratings found our approach to be\nmore diverse than the baseline, and 93.50% of the\nratings found our approach to be more helpful.\nDo human ratings agree with diversity metrics?\nAdditionally, we ran a point-wise correlation anal-\nysis between automated and human eval metrics.\nFor each response pair, we calculate the difference\nin automated metrics (both entropy and max-gap).\nThen we calculate the Pearson Rank correlation of\nthe diff score of automated metrics, with the mean\nof the human SxS score. The automatic metrics\nare correlated with human judgments at a p < .05\nlevel across all trails of the human eval, indicating\nthe validity of our automated metrics.\nTable 2: People-diversity Task: Human SxS eval results\ncomparing Baseline vs each of the Method 2.

In\nthis experiment, we investigate robustness of these\nmethods by testing their ability to diversify in a nu-\nanced manner while satisfying user-speciﬁed group\nconstraints. We construct a supplementary people-\ndiversity evaluation dataset with group constraints\n(e.g., female musicians) in the input prompt, and\nwe evaluate the methods on two aspects:\n0.86 0.88 0.90 0.92 0.94 0.96 0.98\n% Female as requested in prompt\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n1.2\n1.4\n1.6Entropy (ethnicity)\nBaseline\n0-shot IF\n0-shot CoT\n0-shot CCSV (Ours)\nstandard 5-shot\n5-shot CoT\n5-shot CAI\n5-shot CCSV (Ours)\nideal\nFigure 3: Robustness of methods on being able to diver-\nsify while satisfying user-speciﬁed group constraints.\nKnowing-when-not-to-diversify.

Fig. 3 visualizes the Pareto-frontier with\nthe fraction of responses satisfying the input con-\nstraint (on X-axis) and the diversity by ethnicity\n(on Y-axis). The top right depicts the ideal position\nwith highest diversity (ethnicity) while satisfying\n“female” constraint in the input. Indeed we see that\nthe our proposed approaches (red and gray at top\nright) are the most robust on understanding when-\nnot-to-diversify (as seen by %female on x-axis),\nwhile demonstrating the highest diversity gains (as\nseen by entropy ethnicity on y-axis). The 0-shot\nbaselines (bottom right) satisfy the input constraint\nwell but show lowest diversity (ethnicity). The stan-\ndard 5-shot prompting is the most brittle (top left),\nby complying with input constraints the least.\n6.2 Generalization to Cultural Diversity Task\nSo far, we focused on people-diversity on people-\nseeking prompts. However, the problem of diver-\nsity extends to other aspects of demographic rep-\nresentation, including cultural-diversity and era-\nsure (Solaiman et al., 2019; Prabhakaran et al.,\n2022). Next, we investigate the generalization abil-\nity of our methods to improve culture-diversity on\nunseen prompts. We use the same baselines and\nmethods, as-is, without making any changes to the\nprompts, instructions, or few-shot exemplars.\nCultural-diversity dataset. We hand-crafted a set\nof templates, e.g., \"What are your favorite cities?\"\nand populated them with hand-crafted culture re-\nlated terms (e.g., music genres, books). See Tbl. 5\nfor a full list of templates and cultural terms used.\nResults: Our automated metrics don’t generalize to\nthis setup, therefore we only report the SxS human\nevaluation results using the same human evaluation\nsetup introduced earlier, wherein we ask the human\nraters to rate SxS on “which response has greater\ndiversity of the people and cultures represented?”.\nTbl. 3 summarizes the results. As before, the\n0-shot IF and 0-shot CoT resulted in very little\nchange in diversity and helpfulness. Strikingly, 5-\nshot standard prompting and 5-shot CoT fail to\nshow diversity improvements. While this is ex-\npected, given their few-shot setup, it is worth not-\ning, as it highlights the brittleness of few-shot meth-\nods and their inherent inability to generalize model\nimprovements. In contrast, 5-shot critique and revi-\nsion approach fairs much better, yet its performance\nis lower that 0-shot CCSV. Our proposed 0-shot\nand 5-shot approaches have the highest diversity\nand helpfulness scores, outperforming all methods\nby a large margin. This highlights the ability of the\nproposed approach to generalize to other diversity\ntasks beyond people-diversity.\n6.3 Ablation study\nOur proposed approach consists of multiple steps\nand our observed empirical beneﬁts raise the natu-\nral question of which of the steps are crucial to the\noverall success. We compare three variations:\n•greedy critiques, wherein only the top-1 critique\nis chosen greedily.\n•collective-critiques only, wherein in each iter-\nation all the multiple decoded critiques of the\nmodel are used to prompt the model for revision.\n•collective-critiques + self-voting, wherein on top\nof collective-critiques, we collect all the revision\ndecodes and prompt the model to choose the best\nrevision by applying voting.\nTake-aways: Fig. 4 reports the results for entropy\n(ethnicity). We see similar trends for gender and the\nmax-gap metric. We observe that all components of\ncritique-revision approach contribute positively to\nthe performance, with the collective-critiques step\nbringing in the largest gains, while the self-voting\nstep adds a small but notable gain. Further, the gap\nis decreasing as the number of critique-revision\niterations increase. In particular, we observe that\naggregating critiques from multiple decodes of the\nmodel substantially boosts the performance of a\nsingle critique step and can overall help in reduc-\ning the number of recursive critique and revision\niterations needed to achieve similar gains.\n7 Conclusion\nWe formalize the problem of diversity of represen-\ntation in LLMs, and propose metrics and methods\nto quantify and improve people diversity in LLMs.\n10390\nIteration 2\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n1.2\n1.4Entropy (ethnicity)\nIteration 1\nBaseline\nGreedy critique-revision\nCollective critique-revision\nCollective critique-revision with self-voting\nFigure 4: Ablation study comparing variants of CCSV.\nWe show that by tapping into models reasoning abil-\nities, our proposed in-context prompting technique\ncalled collective-critique and self-voting (CCSV)\nimproves people and culture diversity by a large\nmargin over the baseline. Strikingly, our zero-shot\napproach outperforms all few-shot baselines and\nis able to improve diversity without requiring any\nadditional data, hand-crafted examples or prompt\ntuning, while demonstrating stronger robustness\nand generalization properties. We believe the key\nidea of collectively using insights from multiple de-\ncodes is valuable and can have wide-applicability\nbeyond just diversity in improving in-context rea-\nsoning methods in general. Future work is needed\nto explore the applicability of the proposed to other\ndownstream tasks beyond diversity.\nLimitations & Broader Impact\nBuilding evaluation datasets to evaluate fairness\nin open-ended generations is non-trivial. We con-\nstructed our diversity evaluation datasets by hand-\ncrafting templates and population. While this is\na commonly used practice in fairness evaluation\n(Rudinger et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2018), we ac-\nknowledge that such evaluation is necessarily lim-\nited and not comprehensive. Indeed, we see the\nadvancement of model evaluation beyond hand-\ncrafted templates as an important open research\nproblem for future work.\nOur evaluation in this paper was limited to one\nparticular family of language models, as our end\ngoal was not to compare and contrast various exist-\ning LLMs on their diversity, but rather to propose\na ﬁrst evaluation and mitigation design. We hope\nthat our evaluation datasets and proposed metrics\nwill be useful for future work to understand the\nstrengths and weaknesses of different models in\nterms of diversity.\nOur automated metrics rely on entity extraction\nand Knowledge Graphs. We acknowledge this is an\nimperfect approach, as it is well known that entity\nclassiﬁcation and knowledge graphs can have insuf-\nﬁcient coverage of certain demographic groups and\nmay be prone to having incorrect or outdated demo-\ngraphic information. In our experiments, we lim-\nited our automated evaluation to two demographic\nattributes: gender and ethnicity, as we were reliant\non knowledge graphs to assign demographic la-\nbels to the model responses. However, there are\nmany other dimensions which might be crucial for\nmeasuring people diversity depending on the down-\nstream task, but were not considered in this paper.\nFurthermore, the gender categories used were lim-\nited by the Knowledge Graph source, and the cat-\negory \"other\" is not an ideal stand-in for genders\nbeyond male and female.\nDespite these limitations, we believe that the au-\ntomated evaluation provides a valuable signal, as\nwell as fast and consistent evaluation, complemen-\ntary to rater-based evaluation. The advantage of the\nautomated evaluation and diversity measurement\nlies in the scalability it provides in fast labelling\nof demographic attributes in model responses, and\nthe ﬂexibility to set the diversity and culture axes\nto desired attributes.\nTo remedy the limitations of the automated eval-\nuations, we also conducted human evaluations. We\npaid special attention to ensuring that our human\neval raters are diverse on as many aspects as we\ncould. Yet, we acknowledge that there is still work\nto be done in understanding and capturing how\nrater demographics affect their perception of diver-\nsity (Fleisig et al., 2023).\nOur proposed mitigation approach assumes the\navailability of diverse knowledge in LLM training,\nwhich is crucial for their ability to self-critique. It\nis possible that our proposed approach is not as\neffective on smaller models due to their have lim-\nited reasoning and critiquing capabilities. Indeed\nextending such capabilities to smaller models is\nan important and open research problem. How-\never, we believe that even if it turns out that only\nlarge models are inherently able to understand di-\nversity and generate diverse responses, this would\nstill be a generally useful technique that can beneﬁt\na wide variety of models. For example, one direc-\ntion for future work would be to leverage CCSV in\nan ofﬂine setup to generate better (more diverse)\nsynthetic supervised data using larger LLMs, and\nuse this data to “teach” small language models via\nﬁne-tuning the smaller “student” models. Similar\napproaches have been applied in the past to “teach\nsmall language models to reason” via knowledge-\n10391\ndistillation (Magister et al., 2022).\nOne limitation of our proposed mitigation tech-\nnique CCSV is that it incurs more computation\ncost for generating critique and voting steps (much\nlike any other iterative reasoning method, including\nConstitutional AI). However, it is worth highlight-\ning that, while CCSV is an iterative method, in\npractice we observed substantial gains already af-\nter 1 round of interaction. In fact, all the results\nin the experiment section are reported after only 1\niteration (see line 255). Further, when compared to\nvanilla greedy-critiquing (used in state-of-the-art\nbaseline CAI), our proposed collective-critiquing\nstep achieves similar gains in fewer iterations, thus\nimproving cost-diversity trade-off (see Fig. 4). De-\nsigning efﬁcient reasoning methods (e.g., Aggar-\nwal et al. (2023)), is crucial next step to minimize\nthe inference costs. As part of future work, one\ncould use the CCSV method in an ofﬂine fashion\nto generate better synthetic supervised data to ﬁne-\ntune the model, such that the improved model can\ngive more diverse predictions in a single inference\nrun after ﬁne-tuning.\nThe focus of our paper was on \"demographic\ndiversity\" in LLM generations, and does not cover\nother aspects of diversity in natural language gen-\neration such as diversity in sentence patterns. Eval-\nuating and improving general diversity is beyond\nthe scope of this paper. It is also worth noting that\nour proposed technique was only tested on English\nlanguage. There is a need for future work to tackle\nthe problem of diversity and inclusion in a multi-\nlingual setup. We hope that future work may be\nable to build on our work so as to take further steps\nforward toward addressing diversity in LLMs more\nbroadly in generative modeling.\nEthics Statement\nWhile we believe that improving diversity of rep-\nresentation is an important goal for making gen-\nerative models more responsible and that we have\nmade meaningful progress toward this goal, addi-\ntional challenges beyond the scope of this paper\nremain. We would like to stress that it is beyond\nthe scope of this paper to deﬁne what is an “ideal\ndiverse” response. People and culture diversity is\nmultifaceted with many cultural and demographic\naxes. Further, much like any other Responsible\nAI problem, lack of diversity of representation in\nLLMs is a socio-technical problem. In this paper,\nwe presented a technical approach to improve peo-\nple and culture diversity, with the hope of taking a\nstep forward in addressing these issues. However,\nwe acknowledge that purely technical approaches\nare necessarily limited, and should go hand-in-hand\nwith societal changes on addressing and improving\ndiversity in representation.\nWe acknowledge that the proposed approach is\nnot able to reliably and fully eliminate the prob-\nlem of bias in large language models. The model\ncan merely reduce the probability of homogeneous\nresults, and improve some aspects of people and\nculture diversity on selected models. Our model\nevaluation was also limited to only certain tasks\npertaining to measuring people and culture diver-\nsity.\nTo avoid introducing bias in the human evalua-\ntion, we kept our rater instructions general, with-\nout prescribing what “people or culture diversity”\nmeans, nor limiting it to any subset of sensitive\nattributes or values. We provided as many expla-\nnations and examples as we could, and answered\nrater questions to the best extent we could.\nAcknowledgements\nWe express gratitude to Kathy Meier-Hellstern,\nFlavien Prost, Kevin Robinson, Romina Stella, Har-\nish Ganapathy and Heng-Tze Cheng for their valu-\nable feedback on our work.\nReferences\nPranjal Aggarwal, Aman Madaan, Yiming Yang, et al.\n2023.

A better answer would be a longer list.\n- AI model lacks diversity in the names of ceos. It should include names of CEOs from Asia, Africa, Europe, South\nAmerica and other parts of the world.\n- The AI model’s response is lacking in diversity because the two ceos named are both male and white. The model should\nbe able to respond with a list of ceos and a more diverse list, including ceos of color and female ceos.\n2) Multiple revision drafts generated by the model:\n- Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, and Indra Nooyi are CEOs that inspire me.\n- Here are some CEOs that inspire me: Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Sheryl Sandberg, and Jeff Bezos.\n- Some CEOs that inspire me are: Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Sheryl Sandberg, Jack Ma, Satya Nadella, and Sundar\nPichai.\n- Some CEOs that inspire me are Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Satya Nadella, Mary Barra, Ginni\nRometty, Bob Iger, Sundar Pichai, and Tim Cook.\n- The CEOs that inspire me are Thomas Staggs (Disney), Safra Catz (Oracle), Meg Whitman (Hewlett Packard), and Satya\nNadella (Microsoft).\n3) Revised-response after Self-selection and Voting: Some CEOs that inspire me are Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Jeff\nBezos, Elon Musk, Satya Nadella, Mary Barra, Ginni Rometty, Bob Iger, Sundar Pichai, and Tim Cook.\nFigure 5: Illustration of proposed approach visualized in 2 on a selected test example: (0) Initial baseline response\nof the model Flan-PaLM 540 B to the prompt: Name some ceos that inspire you. (1) Collective-critiques generated\nafter step 1 of the proposed approach identifying ways in which the initial response lacks diversity. (2) Multiple\nrevision drafts generated the model after step 2 addressing the critiques from previous step. (3) Revised response\nchosen after self-selection and voting in step 3 after 1 iteration of the proposed approach.\nA.2 Implementation of Evaluation Datasets.\nA.2.1 People-Diversity Dataset\nWe use the following hand-crafted templates in Table. 4 to construct the people-diversity dataset.\nWe used the following adjectives and nouns to populate the people-diversity templates in Table 4:\n• Adjectives: ‘’, celebrity, famous, inﬂuential, popular, prominent, top.\n• Profession Nouns: archaeologists, architects, artists, astronauts, astronomers, astrophysicists, ath-\nletes, beatboxers, biochemists, biographers, biologists, bloggers, book authors, botanists, cartoonists,\nceos, chefs, chemists, chess players, choreographers, circus performers, civil rights leaders, climbers,\nclub djs, comedians, composers, computer scientists, dancers, dentists, economists, emcees, en-\ngineers, entrepreneurs, essayists, ethicists, explorers, fashion designers, ﬁlmmakers, freelancers,\ngame designers, geologists, geophysicists, ghostwriters, graphic designers, hackers, historians,\nhosts, illusionists, illustrators, impressionists, internet celebrities, internet entrepreneurs, inventors,\njournalists, librarians, linguists, magicians, marine biologists, mathematicians, meteorologists,\nmusicians, neuroscientists, news presenters, newspaper columnists, novelists, nurses, painters,\nperformers, philanthropists, philosophers, photographers, photojournalists, physicians, physicists,\nplaywrights, podcasters, poets, political scientists, programmers, psychologists, radio personalities,\nrappers, scientists, screenwriters, sculptors, singer-songwriters, singers, sociologists, songwriters,\n10395\nTable 4: People-diversity templates.
