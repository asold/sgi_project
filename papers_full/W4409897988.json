This study aims to propose an iteration of TRIZ integrated by EBD and\nsupported by an LLM. This LLM-based conceptual design model assists designers through the\nconceptual design process. It begins by using question-asking and answering methods from EBD\nto gather relevant information.

Lastly, TRIZ is used to generate inventive solutions. An evaluation is\ncarried out to measure the effectiveness of the integrated approach. The results indicate that this\napproach successfully generates questions, processes designers’ responses, produces functional\nanalysis elements, and generates ideas to resolve contradictions.\nIntroduction\nIn today’s highly competitive markets, innovation has emerged as a crucial element for industries,\nas they can no longer rely solely on quality and quantity. Creative problem-solving skills have\nbeen recognized as a fundamental competency for driving innovation (Bertoncelli et al.,2016;\nFaria, 2019; Nakagawa,2011). The Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) is a structured\napproach to problem-solving that facilitates innovation. This design methodology provides a\nsystematic framework for generating solutions and designing products (Savransky,2000). In\ncomparison to other problem-solving techniques such as brainstorming, mind mapping, lateral\nthinking, Axiomatic Design, Environment-Based Design (EBD), and morphological analysis,\nTRIZ has been identified as a more potent logic for idea generation (Dubois et al.,2012;\nHernandez et al.,2013; Ilevbare et al.,2013; Mohammadi et al.,2022). Advocates of TRIZ believe\nthat it allows for the generation of more innovative ideas in a shorter time frame due to its\nstructured approach (Belski and Belski,2015; Gronauer and Naehler,2016; Ilevbare et al.,2013;\nKeong et al.,2017; Mohammadi and Forouzanfar,2021; Taskin et al.,2017). According to Poppe\nand Gras (Poppe and Gras,2002), TRIZ is embraced by Western companies as it enables rapid\ninnovation of products, thus enhancing their competitiveness in the current market landscape.\nHowever, learning TRIZ can be challenging and time-consuming, and its application can be\ncomplex, potentially leading to misunderstandings and creating barriers for users (Mohammadi\net al., 2022). It has been emphasized that designers must undergo thorough and advanced\ntraining to effectively utilize TRIZ (Fiorineschi et al.,2018; Fiorineschi et al.,2021). Furthermore,\nTRIZ is primarily applicable in situations where a problem can be defined by its technical\nparameters and technical or physical contradictions are apparent. However, identifying these\ncontradictions in the design problems is not always straightforward, especially considering that\ndesign problems are inherently ambiguous, particularly in the initial stages (Mohammadi et al.,\n2022). Fundamentally, while TRIZ excels in idea generation, it lacks the ability to systematically\nexplore design problems and offer designers essential insights before commencing effective idea\ngeneration. In contrast, EBD offers a comprehensive methodology for processing design prob-\nlems, asking the design questions, and acquiring proper design knowledge (Dubois et al.,2012).\nThis study seeks to introduce a model that integrates EBD into TRIZ to enhance the\nmethodology. Additionally, we utilized the capabilities of a Large Language Model (LLM),\nArtificial Intelligence for\nEngineering Design, Analysis\nand Manufacturing\nwww.cambridge.org/aie\nResearch Article\nCite this article:Mohammadi A and Zeng Y\n(2025).

This is followed by the“Integrated Support of TRIZ by\nEBD and LLM” section, which introduces the proposed model and\ndescribes the evaluation methods. The“Test Cases and Results”\nsection presents the outcomes of the evaluation, while the\n“Discussion” section interprets the findings. Finally, the\n“Conclusion” section summarizes the study’s contributions and\nimplications.\nRelated work\nTRIZ\nTRIZ was conceived by Genrich Altshuller and his colleagues in the\nformer USSR. Altshuller first introduced the principles of more\neffective thinking in inventive engineering in 1956. In the 1980s,\nthe method evolved into a systematic creativity toolset known as\nthe“Theory of Inventive Problem Solving” (TRIZ) and later expanded\ninto a“General Theory of Powerful Thinking” (OTSM) and“Lifetime\nStrategy for a Creative Person” (ZhSTL) in the 1990s, among other\nvariations. The main approach, known as the“Algorithm for Invent-\nive Problem Solving” (ARIZ), also underwent further development\nfrom 1965 to 1985 (Mohammadi et al.,2022;S a v r a n s k y ,2000).\nHowever, the development of TRIZ did not initially follow the\nconventional scientific development process, as all potential\ndevelopments had to be approved by the founder instead of being\npeer-reviewed (Cascini, 2012; Chechurin, 2016). Moreover, the\nconstraints imposed by the Cold War era hindered the global\ndissemination of TRIZ (Fiorineschi et al.,2018). Following Alt-\nshuller’s passing in 1998, the International TRIZ Association\n(MATRIZ) acquired all rights to TRIZ in 1999. Subsequently,\nvarious organizations with TRIZ expertise developed their own\nversions of TRIZ, such as ITRIZ, TRIZ+, xTRIZ, CreaTRIZ, and\nOTSM-TRIZ. In 2007, the book “Hands-on Systematic Innov-\nation for Business and Management ” was published (Darrell,\n2007), detailing the application of TRIZ in business and man-\nagement. Additionally, new TRIZ tools such as Root Conflict\nAnalysis (RCA+) (Souchkov, 2005)a n dP r o b l e mN e t w o r k i n g ,\nHybridization (Prushinskiy et al.,2005) were introduced. Further-\nmore, several efforts were made to integrate TRIZ with modern\nQuality Management methods such as Quality Function Deployment\n(Yamashina et al.,2002), Six Sigma (Zhao,2005), and Axiomatic\nDesign (Borgianni and Matt,2015).\nTRIZ’s primary approach to addressing design problems involves\nidentifying contradictions within the problem and resolving them.\nTRIZ categorizes contradictions into three types (Savransky,2000):\nadministrative, technical, and physical, and asserts that there is a\ncontradiction at the root of every design problem (Petrov,2019). The\ntheory provides tools such as SU-Field analysis and functional ana-\nlysis to deconstruct the design problem and examine the relation-\nships among its elements. Subsequently, the designer identifies\ncontradictions within harmful relationships and employs TRIZ\ntools, such as the 40 principles for idea generation, to address\nthem (Rantanen et al.,2017).\nTRIZ as a design method has been experienced in different areas\nranging from engineering to management and even biology. How-\never, most applications of TRIZ, according to Scopus research result\nanalysis, have been defined in engineering. The method has been\napplied to various engineering problems such as launching new\nproducts (Stratton and Mann,2003), upgrading quality processes\n(Yamashina et al., 2002), improving the quality of products\n(Stratton and Mann, 2003) and systems (Cavallucci and Weill,\n2001), reducing the environmental footprint (Spreafico and Russo,\n2016), designing plastics (Cascini and Rissone,2004), optimizing\nenergy (Jones et al.,2001), analyzing patents (Sharma et al.,2016),\nand developing software (Kluender,2011).\nTRIZ is also applicable in management concepts such as\ne-commerce (Domb and Mann,2001), crowd management (Pin\net al.,2011), innovation management (Livotov,2008), and market-\ning (Zouaoua et al.,2010). The theory has also been applied to\nspecific problems in areas including agriculture (Liu and Lu,2008),\nbiology (Vincent et al.,2005), education (Wits et al.,2010), story-\nwriting (Mohammadi and Forouzanfar,2021), and drug develop-\nment (Farber et al.,2018).\nEnvironment-based design (EBD)\nEBD (Zeng,2015) is a design methodology to help designers in the\ninventive design process. The development of EBD has gone\nthrough a few phases. At first, recursive logic was discovered as a\nnew logic for design in 1991 (Zeng and Cheng, 1991), which\nformulates design’s intricate nature of recursion. The second phase\nwas initiated by defining design in mathematical models where the\nrecursive logic was redefined in set theory and a design-governing\nequation was developed (Zeng,2002; Zeng and Gu,1999a; Zeng and\nGu, 1999b; Zeng and Jing,1996). The third phase was marked by\ndefinitions of the design problem, design solution, and design\nknowledge in the structure of the product environment. The new\nform integrated design requirements, product functions, product\nbehavior, and design solutions into the structure of the environment\n(Zeng, 2004, 2015; Zeng and Gu,2001). Thus, the design process was\nmathematically formulated into an environment evolution process\n(Nguyen and Zeng,2012; Razavi et al.,2024; Zeng,2004, 2015).\nIn EBD, designers are encouraged to start by analyzing the\nproduct environment before delving into the product itself. This\napproach places a strong emphasis on the product’s surroundings\nand leverages the environment to refine the final product. In this\ncontext, the environment encompasses any existing objects exclud-\ning the product (Zeng, 2020). To analyze the environment, the\nmethodology employs a design statement in its natural language\nform. During this phase, EBD utilizes Recursive Object Model\n(ROM) diagrams to deconstruct problems and specific question-\nand-answer strategies to gather information (Wang and Zeng,\n2009; Zeng, 2008; Yang et al, 2023). Moving to the next stage,\nEBD processes the information with the assistance of interaction\nextraction and graph generation. When it comes to interaction\nprocessing, the new problem is redefined in the form of active\nand reactive conflicts (Gutierrez et al., 2014) and interaction\ndependence networks (Yang and Zeng,2020). To generate ideas,\nthe methodology utilizes two different strategies based on the types\nof conflicts (Zeng, 2015). While EBD is a reliable and effective\nmethod for design problem analysis, its solution generation phase is\nnot particularly robust (Dubois et al.,2012).\nLarge language models\nSignificant strides have been made in the adoption of LLMs for\nnatural language processing tasks. These models undergo thorough\ntraining using deep learning techniques on a diverse range of\ntextual big data. The initial model introduced for this purpose\n2 Ali Mohammadi and Yong Zeng\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0890060425000083 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nwas word2vec, capable of performing fundamental tasks such as\nidentifying semantic and syntactic relationships between words.\nSubsequently, more sophisticated models such as GloVe, ELMo,\nand BERT were developed. Leveraging advanced transformer\narchitecture and unsupervised learning on large data, OpenAI\nintroduced GPT models, which h ave produced cutting-edge\nresults in various natural language processing tasks, including\nlanguage modeling, sentiment analysis, and text completion.\nOther companies have also launched their specific LLMs: Meta\nunveiled Llama, Amazon introduced Titan, and Google presented\nGemini (Devlin et al.,2019; Pennington et al.,2014;R a d f o r de ta l . ,\n2018;W a n ge ta l . ,2023).\nLarge language models applications in conceptual design\nNumerous efforts have been made to explore the capabilities of the\nLLMs for the advancement of conceptual design and innovation\n(Binz and Schulz,2023; Dortheimer et al.,2024; Khanolkar et al.,\n2023; Zhu and Luo,2023). It seems LLMs could possess some level\nof reasoning that could be applied to the design process (Fang et al.,\n2024). Zhu and Luo (2023) argued that the limitations in designer\nknowledge are the primary source of design fixation, and employ-\ning LLMs in the design process could enhance knowledge accessi-\nbility, thereby fostering the generation of more innovative and\neffective ideas. Ma et al. (2023) used GPT 3 to generate solutions\nfor a series of design problems and compared them with solutions\ngenerated by humans in a crowdsourced process. The result showed\nthat the LLM could generate feasible and useful solutions. Zhou\net al. (2024) studied two groups of designers, one using LLM and the\nother not, and demonstrated that the LLM-Human group gener-\nated acceptable solutions in less time. Furthermore, LLMs have\nbeen successfully utilized in understanding customer needs, SWOT\nanalysis, manufacturing planning, and brainstorming (Gomez\net al.,2024; Han and Moghaddam,2021; Hu et al.,2023; Just,2024).\nMoreover, it has been claimed that engaging with LLM through\na systematic manner and structured prompts can significantly\ninfluence the design process (Tian et al.,2024). Several studies have\nused LLMs in the design process when adhering to specific or\nstructured design methodologies. B. Wang et al. (2023) harnessed\nLLM to adhere to function behavior structure (FBS) design prin-\nciples in order to tackle design challenges. Chen et al. (2024c)\nproposed an LLM-augmented morphological analysis approach\nto facilitate the efficient generation of innovative design ideas\nduring the conceptual design phase. They used a questioning\nstrategy, which is similar to the question template proposed for\neliciting product requirements (M. Wang and Zeng,2009), as well\nas the FBS model and Kansei Engineering to guide LLMs to assist\ndesigners in the design process. Additionally, Schmidt et al. (2024)\ndiscussed the potential of LLMs in enhancing human-centered\ndesign. In a similar vein, Koh (2023) exploited the ChatGPT API\nto leverage the design structure matrix (DSM) to efficiently address\ndesign problems. A few studies have also applied TRIZ concepts to\nLLMs to enhance the design process. Trapp and Warschat (2024)\ndemonstrated that GPT-4 could be used to extract contradictions\nfrom patents and provide novel insights into TRIZ principles.\nZlotin et al. (2023) introduced software that utilizes TRIZ concepts\nto prompt ChatGPT in resolving design issues. Another study by\nJiang and Luo (2024) proposed AutoTRIZ, a model capable of\nidentifying contradictions and generating design solutions. How-\never, a notable weakness of current studies integrating TRIZ into\nLLMs is their sole reliance on TRIZ to address design problems,\nwhile TRIZ by itself has weaknesses in processing design problems\n(Ilevbare et al.,2013; Mohammadi et al.,2022).\nMoreover, the majority of studies that involve LLMs in the\ndesign process share another incapacity–they tend to treat LLMs\nas a black box. This approach involves providing LLMs with a\ndesign problem and expecting them to produce accurate solutions.\nHowever, design problems are inherently ambiguous, which makes\nit challenging for designers to fully grasp the precise nature of the\nproblem in the initial stages of design (Zeng and Gu, 1999a).\nTherefore, it is unrealistic to anticipate that a machine will offer\nan exact solution when presented with an incomplete or ambiguous\ndesign problem statement. A more effective approach would\ninvolve using LLMs as a tool to aid designers at various stages of\nthe design process.\nIntegrated support of TRIZ by EBD and LLM\nIn the subsequent sections, we will delve into the methodologies\nutilized to devise and evaluate the proposed approach. This will\nencompass an elaborated explanation of the rationale behind util-\nizing EBD and TRIZ in designing the functions, as well as the\nevaluation process employed to demonstrate model efficacy. It is\nour intention that this information will furnish readers with a\nthorough comprehension of the approach’s functions as well as\nits range of capabilities.\nReasoning flow and functions\nDesign is a sophisticated process that begins with defining design\nrequirements and concludes with product descriptions (Zeng and\nGu, 1999a). Many individuals view the conceptual design phase as a\nstage for generating solutions. While solutions are the primary\noutput of the conceptual design process, it is essential for designers\nto not solely focus on solution generation during this phase. In their\n2022 study, Yang et al. (2022) discussed the decision-making\nprocess in design. This process commences with understanding\nthe correct problem, asking the right questions, collecting pertinent\ninformation, developing appropriate knowledge, and ultimately\nmaking informed decisions (solutions). Easterday et al. conducted\nvarious experiments to establish a logical approach to design.\nThey emphasized that design commences with understanding\nand redefining the design problem, followed by generating solu-\ntions. Zeng and Gu (1999a,b) attempted to apply a science-based\napproach to study and model the design process. Their study simu-\nlated the entire design process and introduced a design-governing\nequation. This equation clearly outlines that the design process\nconsists of three primary stages: problem redefinition (formulating\nand processing design problems), synthesis (solution generation),\nand evaluation (assessing the solutions). In this context, an ideal\ndesign process can effectively aid designers in processing and\nredefining the design problem and, subsequently, generating\nsolutions. Designers can then evaluate the generated solutions\nagainst the main requirements, ending the design process if they\nare satisfied (Zeng and Gu,1999a).\nSeveral studies have analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of\nboth TRIZ and EBD. The findings indicate that while TRIZ excels in\nthe synthesis stage (solution generation), it lacks systematic tools to\nassist designers in problem redefinition (Ilevbare et al., 2013;\nMohammadi et al.,2022). Conversely, EBD is well-equipped with\neffective tools for problem processing and knowledge gathering\n(problem redefinition) but lacks strong ideation tools (Dubois et al.,\n2012). Therefore, integrating these two design methodologies could\nestablish a comprehensive design framework. Consequently, in this\nstudy, we will utilize the modules related to assisting designers in\nArtificial Intelligence for Engineering Design, Analysis and Manufacturing 3\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0890060425000083 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nproblem redefinition from EBD, as well as the modules related to\ndesign synthesis from TRIZ.\nIn this framework, following EBD ’s environment analysis,\nthe designer first inputs the design problem and receives a set of\nquestions and answers from the LLM. Then, EBD’sp r i n c i p l e s\nwere supported by employing the LLM to process the answers\ninto the necessary interactions, which leads to a functional\nanalysis based on TRIZ theory according to generated inter-\nactions. This is where EBD and TRIZ are integrated. Finally, the\ndesigner selects the conflict to be resolved for the LLM to\ngenerate ideas based on TRIZ principles to resolve the selected\nconflict. This corresponds to TRIZ’s solution generation. The\nentire process is reorganized into six LLM-centered stages, as\ndepicted in Figure 1.\nIn the following sections, each stage will be elaborated upon\nusing the example of designing a house that can fly to demonstrate\nhow each stage works. This kind of open-ended problem, which is\nseen in various daily and creative situations, has been utilized in\npresenting EBD methodology and remains a grand challenge\nfor TRIZ.\nIt is worth noting that this approach was entirely coded using the\nLangChain framework in Python. About 18 prompts with the\narchitecture of a single prompt or sequential chain have been\nemployed, all of which followed LangChain instruction (https://\npython.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/get_started/introduction/, Retrieved\non June 15, 2024). This means that each prompt exploits a system\ntemplate and a human template, with the option to utilize an AI\ntemplate if necessary. The full text of the 18 prompts is provided in\nAppendix 1.\nOne intriguing aspect of LLMs is the“temperature” parameter.\nThe LLM temperature controls the distribution of probabilities\nassigned to possible next words in a sequence. At low temperatures,\nthe model tends to produce more deterministic outputs, while at\nhigher temperatures, the outputs become more varied, creative, and\npotentially less coherent (Nakaishi and Hukushima, 2022; Suri\net al.,2024). The temperature for all of the LLM’s API through all\nthe functions was adjusted to 0 to ensure consistent and fixed\noutput, except that the temperature for Stage 6, idea generation,\nwas set to 1 to enhance the LLM’s creativity during the process of\ngenerating ideas.\nStage 1: Analyzing design problem and generating questions\nWe input a design problem as a sentence. It is common for a design\nproblem to be vague and unclear, especially in the initial design\nstages (Zeng and Gu, 1999a). Therefore, it is important to\ngather information to clarify the design problem for designers.\nEBD offers a systematic strategy for generating questions in this\nregard (M. Wang and Zeng, 2009;Y a n ge ta l . ,2022;Z e n g ,\n2020). This strategy involves breaking down the design problem\nstatement into nouns and verbs. By asking questions starting\nwith “what” related to the noun phrases and “why,”“ how,”\n“who,”“ when,” and “where” related to the verbs, we can gather\ninformation to clarify the design problem. Additionally, asking\nsimilar questions about the entire design problem statement\nwithout dissecting the nouns and verbs can provide further\ninsight. Therefore, in the initial stage, we utilize EBD’ss t r a t e g y\nto clarify the design problem and generate relevant questions.\nFigure 2 illustrates the core internal working strategy of this\nmodule.\nIn Figure 3, we can see a detailed illustration of the stage\n1 procedure. The question generation function is comprised of\nsix distinct components. The process begins by analyzing the\ndesign problem statement and retrieving nouns using prompt\n1, and their corresponding types (human or non-human) using\nprompt 2. Afterward, if the noun is human, the question“who is +\nnoun?” is generated for that noun. If the noun is non-human,\n“what is + noun?” is generated. For instance, if the design prob-\nlem is to“design a house that can fly,” the function would extract\nall the nouns in this sentence using prompt 1. In this case, the\nonly noun is“house.” Prompt 2 would then classify this noun as\nnon-human. Based on this classification, prompt 3 would use\n“what” to generate the question,“What is a house?” (See Table 1,\nQuestion 1).\nThe subsequent stage of the process entails posing questions\nbased on the verbs. To achieve this, the design problem aided by\nprompt 4 is dissected into its constituent sentences if it comprises of\nmore than one sentence. Prompt 5 then utilizes the interrogatives\nwhy, how, when, where, and who to generate questions for each\nsentence. For instance, in the example of“Design a house that can\nfly,” the questions listed inTable 1, from 3 to 7 and 8 to 12, are\ngenerated at this stage.\nFigure 1.Six stages to integrate EBD, TRIZ, and LLM for resolving design problems.\n4 Ali Mohammadi and Yong Zeng\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0890060425000083 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nThe third component of this function is focused on the seman-\ntic interpretation of the verb and the generation of a correspond-\ning inquiry. To achieve this, prompt 6 is employed to extract the\nverbs from the design problem. Subsequently, prompt 7 is utilized\nto inquire about the meaning of the verb. As depicted inTable 1,\nquestions 2 and 13 were formulated in this section.\nIn this stage, so far, we have deconstructed the“flying house”\ndesign problem and formulated inquiries based on its nouns and\nverbs within the context of the problem. The subsequent part\nentails posing a series of five“wh” questions that pertain to the\nentire design problem. This step involves questioning the design\nproblem using why, where, when, who, and how. Prompt 8 would\nexecute this part. For instance, some questions, such as questions\n14–18 inTable 1, have been produced by applying this part to the\nsample design problem, designing a house that can fly. This\naligns well with the 5WH questioning algorithm proposed by\nWang and Zeng (2009). Chen et al. (2024a) used the similar\n5W1H questioning approach with an example of“flying car” in\ntheir LLM effort to elicit product requirements.\nThe final segment of the function, prompted by prompt\n9, evaluates all the generated questions and filters out any dupli-\ncates. This is necessary becausesome generated questions may be\nredundant, and this step ensures that only unique questions are\nreturned.\nFigure 3.Question generation function.\nFigure 2.The internal working strategy of the questioning function.\nArtificial Intelligence for Engineering Design, Analysis and Manufacturing 5\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0890060425000083 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nStage 2: Answering questions\nDuring the second stage, it is essential to address the questions\ngenerated, which can be divided into two types: those that start\nwith “what” and those that begin with“where, ”“ when, ”“ how,”\n“who,”“ why.” While questions that begin with“what” aims to\nexplore the object ’s meaning, background, and environment,\nthose that begin with“why,”“ when,”“ where,” and “how” focus\non the specific context of the design problem, such as the location,\nand time, and specific reasons behind the problem. Typically,\nquestions that begin with “what” can be answered through\nresources such as the internet, books, or papers, while other\nquestions may require specialized data available at a specific time\nand location (Zeng,2020).\nAlthough exploring the desi gn problem situation can help\nanswer “why,”“ where,”“ when,” and “how” questions, processing a\nlarge amount of data to answer“what” questions can be challenging.\nEBD has a specific template to address“what” questions (Wang and\nZeng, 2009; Zeng, 2020). In this context, EBD recommends first\ndetermining the meaning of the object. Next, the object’s lifecycle\nshould be identified, along with all its relationships with other objects\nthroughout its entire lifecycle (the object’s environment). This\napproach provides a structured way to answer questions begin-\nning with‘what.’LLM can play a crucial role in defining an object,\nidentifying its lifecycle, and understanding its interactions with\nother objects throughout the lifecycle. Following the EBD strat-\negy, a module could be developed to effectively handle these types\nof questions. Figure 4 provides an illustration of the module’s\ninternal operational strategy at this stage.\nFigure 5\nillustrates the details of the approach employed in this\nstage. The answering function receives the object name as input and\nleverages prompt 10 to explore the object’s dictionary definition.\nNext, with the assistance of prompt 11, the object’s lifecycle is\nextracted and presented in a JSON output format with the aid of\nthe parsed-out chain feature in LangChain. Then, for each stage, the\nrelevant objects and their interactions with the target object are\nextracted using prompt 12. To illustrate the generated answers,\nFigure 6shows the output of the function in response to the“What\nis a house?” question.\nStage 3: Extracting interactions from the answers\nIn the previous phase, responses were provided in text form. Now,\ndesigners have a wealth of textual information related to the design\nproblem. However, not all of this information is useful in the design\nprocess. The question is: how can we analyze the text and extract the\nimportant activities occurring in the design problem environment?\nThe systematic approach proposed by EBD involves processing\nanswers. EBD encourages designers to recognize action verbs in\nthe text (verbs that denote an action, such as run, eat, do, warm, etc.)\nand rephrase each sentence containing an action verb in the form of\n(subject + action verb + object). This approach condenses the\nextensive text into the most critical actions taking place in the\ndesign problem environment. EBD refers to these reworded sen-\ntences as“interactions” (Zeng, 2003, 2020). These interactions could\nbe used for generating performance network or could be used to\nproduce functional analysis since they represent design environment\nTable 1. Generated questions by the proposed prompt\nDesign problem: design a house that can fly\nNum Generated questions by the LLM\n1 What is a house?\n2 What do you mean by designing?\n3 Where do you design a house?\n4 Why do you design a house?\n5 How do you design a house?\n6 When do you design a house?\n7 Who designs a house?\n8 Where can the house fly?\n9 Why can the house fly?\n10 How can the house fly?\n11 When can the house fly?\n12 Who can fly the house?\n13 What do you mean by “design a house that can fly”?\n14 Where do you need a house that can fly?\n15 When do you need a house that can fly?\n16 Why do you need a house that can fly?\n17 How do you need a house that can fly?\n18 Who is responsible for designing a house that can fly?\nFigure 4.Internal strategy of the module.\nFigure 5.Answering function.\n6 Ali Mohammadi and Yong Zeng\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0890060425000083 Published online by Cambridge University Press\ncomponents and their relationship together (Rantanen et al.,2017;\nZeng and Gu,1999b).\nFigure 7illustrates the details of the procedure used at this stage.\nAll the answers in text format will be input into the function. In the\nfirst part, the text will be separated into single sentences using the“.\nsplit()” function in Python. Next, each separate sentence will be\nanalyzed. With the help of Prompt 13, the LLM will be triggered to\nrecognize all the action verbs contained in the sentence. If there is\nno action verb present, the LLM will return with a message indi-\ncating that there is no action verb. However, if the sentence does\ncontain an action verb, Prompt 14 will ask the LLM to return the\nsentence in the format of subject + action verb + object. Prompts\n13 and 14 will analyze the sentence in the form of a chain. The\noutput of this function will be a list of interactions extracted from\nthe generated answers. As an example,Table 2 demonstrates the\ntext and extracted interactions for the part of the answers that were\ngenerated in the previous stage.\nStage 4: Generating functional analysis based on the extracted\ninteractions\nFunctional analysis, very similar to the performance network pro-\nposed by Zeng and Gu (1999b), is a crucial technique used in TRIZ\nto help designers break down a given scenario and identify any\ninconsistencies that may be causing contradictions. To conduct a\nfunctional analysis, designers need to follow specific steps. First,\nthey should create a comprehensive list of all components in the\ndesign environment. Next, they should examine the relationships\nbetween each component and others. Components that cause\nchanges or maintenance in other components are known as\n“Tools,” while the affected components are called“Objects.” These\nrelationships can be categorized as either useful or harmful, depend-\ning on the designer’s perspective (Rantanen et al.,2017). Therefore,\nin the third step, the designer should analyze the relationships and\ndetermine which ones are useful or harmful from their perspective.\nAccording to TRIZ principles, behind each harmful relationship lies\nFigure 6.Answering “What is a house” by the model.\nFigure 7.Interaction extraction function.\nTable 2. Interaction extraction example\nTEXT A house is a building that serves as a dwelling for\nindividuals or families. A house usually has a specific\nlife cycle and some environment in its lifecycle. The\nfirst stage of the life cycle of a house is design. In this\nstage, the environment is classified as the following:\nBuilt environment: The design process involves\ncreating blueprints, floor plans, and 3D models for\nthe house.\nHuman environment: Designers collaborate with\nclients to understand their needs and preferences for\nthe house.\nNature environment: Natural elements such as\nsunlight, wind direction, and topography influence\nthe design decisions for the house.\nExtracted\nInteractions\n/C14 A house serves as a dwelling for individuals or fam-\nilies.\n/C14 The design process involves creating blueprints, floor\nplans, and 3D models for the house.\n/C14 Designers collaborate with clients.\n/C14 Designers understand their needs and preferences for\nthe house.\n/C14 Natural elements influence the design decisions.\nArtificial Intelligence for Engineering Design, Analysis and Manufacturing 7\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0890060425000083 Published online by Cambridge University Press\na contradiction (Savransky,2000). Consequently, each harmful rela-\ntionship can be targeted for the next stage to identify a contradiction\nand develop a solution. To simplify the process, the designer can\nalso create a diagram with arrows and related components, helping\nthem determine the type of relationship on the diagram (Rantanen\net al.,2017).\nIn Figure 8, a detailed procedure is presented for developing a\nmodule that systematically generates functional analysis at this\nstage. The input to this function is a text containing a list of all\ninteractions generated in the previous stage. The text would initially\nbe split into separate sentences using the“.split()” function. Then,\nfor each sentence, the LLM would analyze the interaction and\nextract the tool, object, and the impact of the tool on the object,\nas well as the impact of the object on the tool, with the assistance of\nprompt 15. The output of this function is a parsed JSON containing\nfunctional analysis components and their relationships. Using this\ninformation, a designer can generate functional analysis.Figure 9\ndemonstrates an example that shows generating functional analysis\ncomponents for an interaction.\nStage 5: Selecting a contradiction\nAs previously discussed, the relationship between two compo-\nnents in a functional analysis can be categorized as either harm-\nful or useful. While one designer may deem a relationship\nas harmful, another designer might view it as useful based on\ntheir knowledge, experience, and perspective (Orloff,2016;R a n -\ntanen et al.,2017). When a relationship is labeled as harmful, it\nindicates that there is a contradiction for the designer to address.\nIn other words, behind every harmful classified interaction lies a\ncontradiction for the designer that must be resolved (Petrov,\n2019;S a v r a n s k y ,2000). During this stage, the LLM should not\nintervene; instead, it should allow the designer to select the\ncontradictions based on their perspective.\nTherefore, in this stage, designers should first select a harmful\nrelation and shape it in the contradiction format defined in TRIZ\n(Rantanen et al.,2017): “I want (condition A) for element X because\n(the reason), and I want the opposite of condition A for element X\nbecause (the reason).” For instance, we can choose this contradic-\ntion, “I want the material of the house to be light to reduce the house\nweight, and I want the material of the house to be not light because\nthe light material is not sturdy,” as a recognized contradiction in the\nsample design problem.\nStage 6: Generating ideas for a selected contradiction\nTRIZ is a powerful methodology that can be used to generate\ninnovative ideas. The primary tool used in TRIZ for idea generation\nis a set of 40 principles, which have been extracted from a detailed\nanalysis of thousands of patents (Savransky,2000). These principles\nserve as the backbone for idea generation in TRIZ. To initiate the\nidea-generation process in this stage, an LLM-empowered function\nis employed to consider the design problem and a selected contra-\ndiction. This function then generates ideas related to the TRIZ\n40 principles.\nTo generate ideas for each of the TRIZ principles, prompt 16 is\nutilized, which runs in a for-loop 40 times. During each iteration,\nthe prompt is provided with the design problem as well as the\ncontradiction and requests LLM to generate ideas for a specific\nTRIZ principle (from principle 1 to principle 40). Once all the ideas\nhave been generated, prompt 17 eliminates any duplicate ideas.\nFinally, prompt 18 is used to identify experts who can provide\nvaluable insights to resolve the contradiction.Figure 10shows the\noverall architecture of the function.Table 3provides an overview of\nthe contradiction, some of the generated ideas, and the experts who\ncan assist with resolving the exemplified design problem,“Design a\nhouse that can fly.”\nEvaluation\nThe model we have developed comprises several distinct functions.\nAs previously explained, the designer inputs a design problem, and\nLLM attempts to generate questions. It is important to evaluate the\neffectiveness of the generated questions. Subsequently, the answers\nare generated, which are then processed, and interactions are\nextracted. Therefore, the functionality of interaction extraction\nshould also be measured. These interactions are then input into\nthe next function, where functional analysis components are\nFigure 8.Functional analysis generation.\nFigure 9.Functional analysis generation example.\n8 Ali Mohammadi and Yong Zeng\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0890060425000083 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nextracted. Hence, the usefulness of the functional analysis function\nshould also be evaluated. Based on the functional analysis, the\ndesigner identifies a contradiction, which is then input into the\nidea generation function to produce new solutions. Consequently,\nthe effectiveness of these solutions should also be considered. In the\nfollowing section, we will provide detailed explanations of the\nmetrics used to assess each function.\nQuestion-generation evaluation\nIn the initial phase of the model, the designer utilizes a question\ngeneration function to input the design problem and produce\ninquiries regarding the design problem. Two metrics can be\nemployed to evaluate the effectiveness of the function: correctness,\nwhich measures the degree to which the generated questions can\nprovide the designer with valuable knowledge, and comprehensive-\nness, which assesses whether the function encompasses all the\nquestions that EBD is designed to address (Koh,2023).\nAs shown in equation ( 1), Question Generation Accuracy\n(QGA) in this stage could be calculated as the number of valid\nquestions generated by the LLM divided by the total number of\nquestions generated. Valid questions are those that provide helpful\ninformation for the designer regarding the design problem.\nQGA ¼\nNumber of valid questions generated by LLM\nNumber of all auestions generated by LLM (1)\nA ss h o w ni ne q u a t i o n(2), Question Generation Comprehen-\nsiveness (QGC) could be calculated as the number of valid\nquestions generated by an LLM that align with EBD questions\nfor a specific design problem divided by the number of questions\ngenerated by a human EBD expert for that specific design\nproblem.\nQGC ¼\nNumber of valid questionsins generated by LLM in line with EBD\nNumber of generated questions by an EBD expert\n(2)\nInteraction extraction evaluation\nUpon answering the generated questions, we utilize the LLM to\napply the EBD concept for processing the responses and extract-\ning the interactions. Two key metrics, Interaction Extraction\nAccuracy (IEA) and Interaction Extraction Comprehensiveness\n(IEC), could be employed to assess the outcomes of this process\n(Koh, 2023). In this context, correctness refers to the ratio of valid\nextracted interactions by LLM to all extracted interactions by\nLLM, as demonstrated in Equation (3). Valid interactions are\ndefined as sentences containing active verbs. As for comprehen-\nsiveness, depicted in Equation (4), it represents the ratio of valid\ninteractions extracted by the LLM from all answers responded to\nthe generated questions for a specific design problem, divided by\nthe number of interactions extracted from those exact answers,\nalbeit this time these interactions were extracted by an EBD\nexpert.\nIEA ¼\nNumber of valid interactions extracted by LLM\nNumber of all interactions extraceted by LLM (3)\nFigure 10.Idea generation function.\nTable 3.

The Functional Analysis Accuracy\n(FAA) can be assessed using equation (5). Essentially, the accuracy\nof the function can be defined as the ratio of valid recognized tools\nand objects extracted from interactions by LLM to all tools and\nobjects extracted by LLM. Valid tools or objects are those that,\naccording to TRIZ, can take a material form, and each tool can\nimpact an object through interaction (Rantanen et al.,2017). Fur-\nthermore, Functional Analysis Comprehensiveness (FAC), as indi-\ncated in equation (6), can be defined as the ratio of valid recognized\ntools and objects by the LLM for a specific design problem to the\nnumber of recognized tools and objects by a TRIZ expert for that\nspecific design problem (Koh,2023).\nFAA ¼\nNumber of  valid tools and objects extracted by LLM\nNumber of all tools and objects extracted by LLM\n(5)\nFAC ¼\nNumber of valid tools and objects extracted by LLM from the interactions\nNumber of Valid tools and objects recognized by the TRIZ expert\n(6)\nIdea generation evaluation\nIn order to assess the effectiveness of the idea generation function of\nthe model, it would be beneficial to consider the metrics outlined in\nShah et al. (2003). These metrics can include measuring the novelty,\nvariety, quality, and quantity of the generated ideas.\nNovelty. Novelty is a metric that gauges the level of uniqueness or\nsurprise associated with an idea in comparison to other ideas. To\nassess the novelty of ideas, we begin by breaking down the problem\ninto its key functions. Subsequently, we analyze each idea by\ndetermining which functions it fulfills. Finally, we determine the\nnovelty score of each idea by utilizing equation (7) as outlined in\nShah et al. (2003).\nS\nJ ¼TJ /C0 CJ\nTJ\n× 10 (7)\nWhere the total number of ideas produced for function j, denoted as\nTj, and the count of the current solution for that function is denoted\nas CJ. The ratio is multiplied by 10 to normalize the expression. The\nnovelty score is then multiplied by the weight assigned to each\nfunction. The novelty of the idea is graded by summing the prod-\nucts of all weights and novelty scores (Shah et al.,2003).\nVariety. Variety serves as a metric for the extent to which the\nsolution space has been explored in the process of generating ideas.\nThe assessment of variety pertains to a collective set of ideas rather\nthan individual ones. To gauge variety, the satisfaction of each\nfunction is scrutinized. Ideas are categorized based on their hier-\narchy and the functions they fulfill and are represented in a tree\ndiagram. Subsequently, the variety score for the set of ideas is\ncomputed using equation (8) (Shah et al.,2003).\nM ¼\nX\nm\nj¼1\nf j\nXn\nk¼1\nSkbk\nn (8)\nwhere bK is the number of branches at level k in a tree diagram; SK is\nthe score for level k and n is the total number of ideas, and m is the\ntotal number of functions;\nQuality. In this context, quality refers to the feasibility of an idea\nand its adherence to design specifications. To assess the quality of\nideas, we referred toTable 4 (Rantanen et al.,2017). Evaluators\ncould use the questions in the table to assess each idea. If the\nsolution does not resolve the contradiction, the idea is rejected\nand receives an overall score of zero. If the solution does resolve\nthe contradiction, it is evaluated using the other questions. The total\nquality score for each idea is determined by summing the scores\nfrom the answers to each question.\nQuantity. Quantity refers to the overall number of ideas produced\nby an individual or a group within a specific timeframe or through-\nout the entire process of going through all the stages in a particular\ndesign method (Shah et al.,2003).\nTest cases and results\nIn this segment, we will conduct an assessment of the proposed\nmodel by employing the evaluation process and metrics delineated\nin “Evaluation” section. The model will be utilized to address three\ndesign problems previously resolved and published by TRIZ\nexperts. Following the application of the model to these design\nproblems, we will evaluate its efficacy and juxtapose the outcomes\nwith the solutions presented by the TRIZ experts.\nTest cases\nTo select the design problems, we surveyed five TRIZ textbooks\n(Bukhman, 2021; Orloff,2016; Petrov,2019; Rantanen et al.,2017;\nSavransky, 2000) and the TRIZ journal website, from which we\nextracted 11 general design problems that have been already\nresolved by TRIZ masters and could be used for this study as test\ncases. Among these, three design problems were found to be\nsolvable through a general LLM without the need for fine-tuning\nor embedding related papers and books on that specific area.\nTable 5provides an overview of the design problems.\nWe entered the design problem into the initial function and\ngenerated the corresponding questions. Subsequently, questions\nbeginning with“what” or “who” were addressed using the proposed\nfunction within this model. Other questions, such as where, why,\nhow, and when, were answered based on the available information\nTable 4.

The model\nprocessed the answers and generated functional analysis based on\nthe interactions. In each case study, we identified the exact contra-\ndiction that the TRIZ expert had considered in the source. Conse-\nquently, we selected that contradiction and utilized the model to\ngenerate ideas. The LLM API used in these three experiments was\nGPT 3.5, which was chosen for its robust capabilities and cost-\neffectiveness, making it both accessible and convenient.\nResults\nIn this study, we engaged evaluators to compare the output of our\nproposed model with the results of TRIZ experts. The evaluators\nwere carefully chosen based on specific criteria, including a com-\nprehensive understanding of design methodologies and tools, prac-\ntical experience in design projects or publications, and strong\ncritical thinking abilities. The evaluators in this study were selected\namong graduate students with experience in design projects and\npublications. All of them possess a deep understanding of design\nconcepts, tools, and methodologies.\nInitially, two experts in EBD assessed the model’s capacity to\nproduce questions and extract interactions using the metrics out-\nlined in Section titles“Question-generation evaluation” and “Inter-\naction extraction evaluation”. The findings of this assessment are\npresented in Table 6, demonstrating a distinct correlation in the\nassessment results. It is evident that the model was capable of\nproducing questions with high accuracy and comprehensiveness.\nSubsequently, the model’s ability to generate functional analysis\nwas assessed by a TRIZ expert based on the criteria outlined in\nSection title “Functional analysis generation evaluation”, and the\nresults were documented inTable 7. While the model was capable\nof generating a comprehensive functional analysis, its accuracy was\naround 50 percent. In the initial case study, 310 items were recog-\nnized in the extracted interactions, comprising 108 unique items\nand the remaining being duplicates. Of the 108 unique items,\n61 were identified as tools or objects, while 47 could not be classified\nas such according to TRIZ concepts. In the second case study,\n252 items were identified, including 128 unique items and their\nduplicates. Among the 128 items, 76 were categorized as tools or\nobjects, while 52 could not be classified in either tool or object\ncategory. In the third case study, 140 items were identified, with\n81 unique items and their duplicates. Out of the 81 items, 47 were\nclassified as tools or objects, while 34 could not be classified\naccording to TRIZ. It is important to note that the elements of\nfunctional analysis for the first case study were not identifiable in\nthe published version of the report, preventing the calculation of the\ncomprehensiveness rate for the generation of functional analysis in\nthis particular case study.\nFollowing the evaluation, two design methodology experts util-\nized the criteria outlined in Section title“Idea generation evaluation”\n–novelty, variety, quality, and quantity–to assess the effectiveness of\nthe ideas generated by both the model and the TRIZ experts. Each\nevaluator followed the instructions for measuring the ideas’ effect-\niveness according to Shah et al. (2003) and calculated the variety and\nnovelty of the ideas generated by the LLM model and TRIZ experts. It\nis noteworthy that each evaluator used their perspective to extract the\nrequired functions for each design problem. Notably, the model\ngenerated a few repetitive ideas in each idea generation for each case\nstudy, which were not considered by the evaluators and thus\nremoved from the list of ideas. The variety score, novelty score,\nand quantity of ideas produced by the model and TRIZ experts are\ndetailed inTable 8.I t’s evident that both the variety and quantity of\nideas generated by the LLM exceed those generated by the TRIZ\nexpert.\nAdditionally, the two experts evaluated the quality of the ideas\nbased on Section title“Quality”. Figure 11demonstrates box plot\ndiagrams showing the quality of the ideas generated by the model\nand those generated by TRIZ experts for the exact same case study.\nIn the third case study, the TRIZ expert proposed two primary ideas\nto address the design issue, but one was rejected by evaluator 1 for\nTable 6.

It is evident that the\nideas generated by the LLM vary widely in quality, ranging from\nvery high-quality ideas to low-quality ones.\nDiscussion\nThis study aimed to develop a conceptual design framework that\nintegrates TRIZ and EBD based on an LLM. The goal is to aid\ndesigners in effectively addressing design problems. The frame-\nwork involves selecting and simulating various modules from\neach design methodology. An important question could be raised\nhere: How and why was each module selected and then tailored\ntogether?\nThe selection and adaptation of modules were based on two\nmain criteria. Firstly, the effectiveness of each design methodology\nin each tool was taken into account. TRIZ experiments demon-\nstrated its strength in problem redefinition and solution generation\n(Mohammadi et al.,2022), while EBD’s studies showed its profi-\nciency in problem-processing and information-gathering (Dubois\net al., 2012). As a result, tools such as systematic question and\nanswering, suitable for understanding design problems and infor-\nmation gathering, were incorporated from EBD, and tools such as\nfunctional analysis and solution generation, suitable for generating\nsolutions, were selected from TRIZ.\nThe second criterion for selecting modules in this framework\nwas to ensure the integrity of the framework. It was important to\nhave a seamless progression through the stages and modules so that\ndesigners could effectively address the design problem by following\nthe prescribed steps. For example, after inputting design problems\nand generating questions and answers, designers are presented with\na large amount of information in text format. In this case, a tool\nfrom EBD for interaction extraction could be used to convert the\ntext into important sentences in a simple subject + verb + object\nformat. The subjects and objects could then be utilized as elements\nfor functional analysis in the next stage, while the verb represents\nthe relationship between these two objects. To ensure the effective-\nness of the interaction extraction module within the model, all three\ncase studies were also analyzed without its inclusion. The responses\nto the questions, without any prior processing, were directly input\ninto the module designated for generating functional analysis.\nSubsequently, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the gener-\nated functional analysis were evaluated according to the metrics\noutlined in Section title“Functional analysis generation evaluation”\nby a TRIZ evaluator.Table 9illustrates the accuracy and compre-\nhensiveness of the functional analysis produced with and without\nthe interaction extraction module. As demonstrated in the table,\nboth the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the functional analysis\ndiminished in the absence of the module.\nThe functional analysis are intended to be based on tools,\nobjects, and the actions that tools exert on objects. The interaction\nextraction module effectively filters the text to extract the relevant\ntools, objects, and actions. Without this module, the functional\nanalysis generation process treats each sentence in the text as a\npotential candidate for functional analysis generation, which leads\nto a decrease in accuracy. Furthermore, certain phrases in the text\nmay not initially present any apparent tools, objects, or actions;\nhowever, they can be restructured to include these elements and be\nutilized in functional analysis creation. For instance, the phrase“the\nweather is hot” may not typically qualify for functional analysis due\nto the absence of distinct tools, objects, or actions. Yet, it can be\nrephrased as “the sun heats the air,” thereby introducing specific\ntools, objects, and actions that can contribute to the functional\nanalysis. The absence of the interaction extraction module results in\nthe exclusion of sentences that could be reformulated into usable\nconstructs for functional analysis, thereby removing numerous\npotential tools and objects. This, in turn, contributes to the\nobserved reduction in comprehensiveness when the interaction\nextraction module is not employed.\nAll the modules in the model were also precisely evaluated\nthrough specific criteria. The results show that the employed\nLLM effectively generated comprehensive and almost accurate\nquestions regarding the design problem. Additionally, the LLM\nsuccessfully identified and extracted interactions from the gener-\nated answers. However, it was observed that the comprehensiveness\nof both question generation and interaction extraction outweighed\nthe accuracy. It is as if the LLM is sometimes unable to adhere\nprecisely to the prompts. For example, in some cases, the LLM\nselected “have or is” as active verbs despite the specified prompt\nstating that“have, has, am, is, are” are not considered active verbs.\nThis discrepancy was particularly prominent in the functional\nanalysis function. Although the prompts regarding identifying tools\nand objects were well stated, the accuracy of correctly identifying\nthe tools and objects was calculated in 50 percent channel which is\ninadequate.\nHowever, the EBD knowledge acquisition stages facilitated the\nmodel to encompass a significantly larger number of components\n(tools and objects) relevant to the design problem, in contrast to the\nsolutions proposed by TRIZ experts. This can be attributed to the\nsystematic acquisition of a substantial volume of data pertaining to\nthe design problem through the EBD stages. Considering a greater\nnumber of tools and objects in analyzing the design problem has the\npotential to uncover more contradictions and streamline the devel-\nopment of a more comprehensive design solution.\nThe application of the model for idea generation proved to be\nparticularly captivating. GPT 3.5 demonstrated a greater variety,\nnovelty, and quantity of generated ideas in comparison to those\ngenerated by TRIZ experts. Moreover, the range of quality in the\nideas produced by GPT 3.5 was extensive, encompassing both\nirrelevant ideas with low-quality scores and a few that exceeded\nthe quality of those generated by the TRIZ experts.\nAs previously noted, Ma et al. (2023\n) conducted a study to assess\nthe performance of GPT 3 in the conceptual design process. They\nemployed 12 prompts without a specific methodology or process\nand tasked the LLM with generating ideas for particular design\nproblems. Their findings indicated that the ideas produced by the\nLLM were more feasible and useful but less novel and diverse\ncompared to those generated by humans. While our evaluation\ndid not include feasibility and usefulness metrics, we found that the\nTable 9.

This could be attributed to the incorporation\nof design methodologies, their tools, and concepts alongside the\nLLM in the design process or the use of a more advanced version of\nthe GPT, GPT 3.5. Chen et al. (2024c) utilized LLM to support\nconceptual design using a specific design approach, morphological\nanalysis. Their findings showed that integrating LLM into the\ndesign process could enhance innovation, functionality, and, ultim-\nately, the quality of design ideas, which aligns with the results of our\nexperiments.\nIn their 2024 study, Jiang and Luo introduced Auto-TRIZ, a\ndesign model that uses LLM to automate TRIZ. The model takes\nproblem statements from users as initial inputs and directly gen-\nerates a solution report by following the TRIZ process. One feature\nof this model is the automatic generation of contradictions by\nmachines, which occurs without the need for designer supervision.\nThe study’s findings demonstrated that Auto-TRIZ streamlines the\nuse of TRIZ and can generate solutions in a short timeframe.\nHowever, the study also acknowledged a limitation: the potential\nfor erroneous information in the solutions generated by the model.\nIn our model, we supplemented TRIZ with EBD, particularly in\nknowledge gathering. Furthermore, the formulation and selection\nof contradictions are performed based on the supervision of the\ndesigner. The majority of ideas generated by our model were\nassessed as doable, with some even surpassing the quality of ideas\ngenerated by human experts.\nChen et al. (2024b) introduced TRIZ-GPT, a model that inte-\ngrates the traditional TRIZ process to identify design issues, extract\nTRIZ parameters, address contradictions, and generate solutions.\nThe study revealed that the model is capable of producing solutions\nsimilar to those generated by humans, but with a wider range. In\nour model, we have incorporated three stages prior to utilizing\nTRIZ to systematically gather knowledge and analyze the design\nproblem environment. As previously mentioned, these stages assist\ndesigners in conducting more comprehensive functional analysis\nand identifying additional contradictions, ultimately leading to the\ngeneration of more solutions.\nThis study is also subject to certain limitations, including a few\nconsidered design problems and a limited number of evaluators to\nassess the solutions. Additionally, not all evaluation metrics may be\nperfectly aligned with the experiments. For instance, comparing the\nnumber of ideas between LLM-generated and TRIZ expert solutions\nin the textbook could be influenced by bias due to the static nature of\nthe textbook solutions. Moreover, all case studies in this research\nwere exclusively conducted using the GPT3.5 API. A more advanced\nmodel could potentially yield results with enhanced accuracy and\ncreativity. Notably, the idea generation phase demands a consider-\nable amount of time as, the LLM meticulously considers each TRIZ\nprinciple individually to produce ideas for each one. While this\nprocess may require 40 to 50 minutes, it leads to a higher quantity\nand diversity of generated ideas compared to constraining the model\nto a few principles. It is plausible that this challenge could be\nmitigated with a more advanced LLM in the future.\nWhen considering the potential use of more advanced LLMs, an\nimportant question also arises: Will this framework still be neces-\nsary if future LLMs offer significantly improved performance? It’s\ncrucial to take into account the inherent nature of the design\nproblem when addressing this question. The design problem is\noften ambiguous and not clearly defined for designers in the early\nstages of the process. In other words, designers themselves may not\nhave a clear understanding of what they want or what the design\nproblem entails, especially in the initial phases of the design process\n(Nguyen and Zeng,2012; Y Zeng and Cheng,1991). Therefore, it\nmay not be practical to expect a highly advanced LLM to provide a\ndefinitive solution when the problem itself is not yet fully under-\nstood. What is needed is an interactive process between the com-\nputer and the designer to gradually clarify the design problem and\nwork toward a solution with the assistance of an LLM. Thus, it\nseems a systematic design model, like the one presented in this\nstudy, is always needed to guide designers in dealing with design\nproblems and generating solutions, even if advanced LLM becomes\navailable in the future.\nOur proposed model is specifically crafted to assist designers\nthroughout the design process. It does not operate as a black box,\nsimply churning out solutions to ambiguous design problems.\nInstead, it actively involves designers at every stage, allowing them\nto review the output and make revisions as needed. Consequently,\ndesigners gain a deeper understanding of the situation. This fosters\na high level of interaction between the designer and the LLM.\nHowever, this study did not explore the impact of designer inter-\naction with the LLM on design projects. This could be a potential\narea for future research.\nConclusion\nThe TRIZ methodology is widely recognized for its effectiveness in\ngenerating innovative solutions but is limited in its approach to\nsystematically processing design problems and facilitating know-\nledge acquisition for designers. Mastering TRIZ can also be time-\nconsuming, intricate, and challenging. In response to these challenges,\nthis study proposes a model that integrates EBD and TRIZ by\nleveraging LLMs to mitigate these limitations. The findings suggest\nthat the model can receive a design problem and provide pertinent,\ninsightful questions to aid designers in acquiring insight relevant to\nthe problem. Furthermore, the model can process the designer’s\nresponses and help generate functional analysis and ideas to resolve\ncontradictions. Importantly, the proposed model does not function as\na black box for problem-solving but rather aims to guide designers\nthrough the design process stages and foster insights.\nThe model’s performance was assessed using the GPT 3.5 API.\nThe results indicate that the model’s comprehensiveness surpasses\nits accuracy. Evaluation of the generated ideas reveals that machine-\ngenerated ideas exhibit greater novelty, diversity, and quantity\ncompared to those generated by TRIZ experts. The quality of the\nideas generated by the LLMs spans a wide spectrum, encompassing\nboth irrelevant ideas and ideas of superior quality compared to\nthose produced by TRIZ experts.\nIt is essential to acknowledge the study’s limitations, including a\nrestricted number of case studies and assessments, as well as the sole\nreliance on testing the model using the GPT 3.5 API. Furthermore,\nthe model’s usability was not evaluated. Moving forward, the\nmodel’s usability will be appraised with novice designers in our\nfuture work.\nData availability statement.

For each verb you must ask questions with what.\nfor example, if the verb is eat you should return: what do you mean by eating? \\n\\n list of verbs are: {verb_list}\nPrompt 8 System template:You are an AI assistant who aims to help designers to extract as much information as possible from a design problem.\nYou get a design problem.\nYou should ask six questions in the following format:\n1- what do you mean by + the whole design problem +?\n2- Where do you need + the whole design problem +?\n3- when do you need + the whole design problem +?\n4- why do you need + the whole design problem +?\n5- How do you need + the whole design problem +?\n6- who is responsible for + the whole design problem +?\nHuman template:The design problem is: {text}\nPrompt 9 System template:You are an AI assistant who can recognize repetitive concepts.\nYou will receive a list of questions; some of these questions may be repetitive or ask about similar concepts.\nYour objective is to provide a list of unique questions without modifying the wording of the original questions or making any other changes to\nthem.\nHuman template:This is the list of questions: \\n {question_final_list}\nPrompt 10 System template:You are a dictionary that could help designers to define {objects}. You would define {objects} clearly and briefly in one sentence.\nHuman template:What is {objects}?\nPrompt 11 System template:You are an AI assistant that could help designers understand the lifecycle of {objects}. You would explain the lifecycle of\n{objects} clearly and very briefly in just four stages and provide a short explanation for every stage.\nHuman template:I would define lifecycle as events that something passes to reach the point that it is. For instance, the lifecycle of an engineer is\nstudying in school, getting good marks, going to college, going to university, and finding an engineering job. What is the life cycle of {objects}’\nPrompt 12 System template:Every {objects} is related to its environment. We would have three types of environments: 1- built environment, 2-human\nenvironment 3- natural environment.\nBuilt environment: Everything directly related to the {objects} and made by humans.\nHuman environment: Every human being is directly related to the {objects}.\nNature environment: Every natural thing like weather, water, etc, that is directly connected to {objects}.\nWhen we want to describe the environment of {objects}, we have to show the relation between {objects} and the environment in sentences.\nyou are an AI assistant that could help designers to understand the environment of {objects}.\nYou would explain the environment of {objects} with single sentences. You would prefer to use action verbs in the sentences.\nHuman template:{lifecycle_stage} is one of the stages of the lifecycle of {objects}.\nConsider {objects} in this stage and determine every part of the environment of {objects} in the separate sentences\n(Continued)\nAppendix 1\nNote: Each element enclosed within the curly braces {} denotes a variable.

While run is an action verb, running is not an action verb.\nYou must return nothing if there is no action verb in the sentence.\nAs an AI research assistant who can analyze sentences, your task is to identify action verbs in a sentence.\nHuman template:Please return the action verbs in this text:\\n {text}\nPrompt 14 System template:As an AI assistant, You would get some action verbs. Your task is to identify these action verbs in the text and split the text into\nindependent sentences.\nEach sentence has only one active verb.\nYou must return nothing if there is no action verb in the sentence.\nYour output is only a sentence without extra explanation.\nHuman template:Regard these action verbs:\\n {action_verbs}.\\n\nIn the following text, identify these action verbs and return a sentence with this format: subject + action verb + object.\nThis is the text:\\n {text}\nPrompt 15 System template:You are an AI assistant that could analyze a sentence and specify a tool, an object, and the impact of tools on the object and the\nimpact of objects on the tool.\nHuman template:Every action has a tool and an object. An action means the tool does something that causes the object to change or to be\nmaintained after the change.\nThus, in every action, there are two material objects (one is a tool, and the other is an object) that interact with each other.\nIn This interaction, the tool must impact the object. If there is no impact on the object, we can conclude that there is no action.\nThe object that impacts the other one is called a tool, and the one that is affected is the object.\nPlease consider these sentences:\\n {text} \\n. Please clarify what the tools and objects are in every sentence.\nPlease also clarify how the tool affects the object and how the object affects the tool\nPrompt 16 System template:You are an AI assistant who can understand a design problem and its contradictions and generate ideas regarding TRIZ\nprinciples.\nThe output text should clearly state generated ideas and provide an example for each idea to better explain them.\nYour output is only the ideas and examples without extra explanation.\nHuman template:TRIZ is an acronym for“Theory of Inventive Problem Solving.” It is a problem-solving methodology that originated in Russia\nand was developed by Genrich Altshuller and his colleagues in the mid-20th century.\nThe 40 Principles of TRIZ are a set of guidelines formulated by Genrich Altshuller, the founder of TRIZ. These principles are based on his analysis\nof thousands of patents across various industries. They serve as strategies for overcoming contradictions and generating inventive solutions for\nproblem-solving and innovation. According to TRIZ, in every design problem, there is a contradiction that would make this design problem.\nNow, I would like to give you a design problem with its contradiction. Please resolve it using Principle {number} of TRIZ.\n\\n Here’s the problem:\\n{problem}\n\\n This is the contradiction recognized in the problem:\\n {contradiction}.\nPrompt 17 System template:You are an AI assistant who is an expert in removing repetitive ideas.
