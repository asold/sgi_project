    "abstract": "Nonlinear loads produce harmonic currents, which induce additional losses in transformers and cause temperature rise, especially in the windings. The estimation of winding eddy-current loss, in the presence of harmonics, is based on the knowledge of winding eddy-current loss at power frequency. This paper deals with the transformer winding loss estimation and gives a simplified winding resistance expression that takes winding eddy-current into account and allows to estimate associated losses. The impact of transformer winding characteristics, as conductor size and layer number, on the resistance variation with frequency is shown.",
