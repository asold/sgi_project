  "abstract": "Abstract Natural language processing (NLP), a subclass of artificial intelligence, large language models (LLMs), and its latest applications, such as Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT), ChatGPT, or LLAMA, have recently become one of the most discussed topics. Up to now, artificial intelligence and NLP ultimately impacted several areas, such as finance, economics and diagnostic/scoring systems in healthcare. Another area that artificial intelligence has affected and will continue to affect increasingly is academic life. This narrative review will define NLP, LLMs and their applications, discuss the opportunities and challenges that components of academic society will experience in rheumatology, and discuss the impact of NLP and LLMs in rheumatology healthcare.",
