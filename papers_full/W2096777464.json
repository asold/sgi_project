We discuss here a DCCT calibration method and\nits implementation with commercial instruments typicallyemployed in low resistance calibration lab-\noratories. The primary current ranges up to2 kA; in the current range below100 A the calibration\nuncertainty is better than3 × 10−7. An example of calibration of a high-performance DCCT speci-\nﬁed for primary currents measurement up to900 A is discussed in detail.\n1. INTRODUCTION\nDirect-current current transformers (DCCT) are the most accurate dc high-current sensors commer-\ncially available [1], reaching speciﬁed relative accuracies in the10−5 range and integral nonlinearities\nbelow 10−6. The veriﬁcation of such high performances and the calibration of the DCCT ratio require\nmetrological facilities capable of handling high currents, with high accuracy and automated operabil-\nity [2–5].\nUltimate current ratio accuracy is achieved in cryogenic current comparators (CCC) [6]. In a CCC, ratio\naccuracy is obtained by constraining the magnetic ﬂux (generated by the current being compared) within\nsuperconducting shields. An extremely high sensitivity isachieved with a superconducting quantum\ninterference device (SQUID) ﬂux sensor. Even though CCCs capable of handling currents up to100 A\nhave been realized [7], these devices are research instruments not available in calibration laboratories.\nFerromagnetic-core, room-temperature current comparators (CC) are current ratio devices which can\nachieve ratio errors lower than10−7 [8], and can be self-calibrated through step-up procedures[9,\n10] with similar levels of uncertainty. Thus, a CC can be employed as current ratio standard in a\nDCCT calibration setup. Although complex and expensive instruments, high-current CC are common\nin electrical calibration laboratories, since they are part of commercial resistance ratio bridges employed\nfor the measurement of low-value resistors. These instruments include also current sources, detectors,\nand ﬁrmware for automated operation.\nThe calibration of the DCCT ratio with a reference current ratio standard (possibly having a different\nnominal ratio) can be performed by different methods. Recent papers [11, 12] describe a method based\non the comparison of the voltages developed by the secondarycurrents of the devices being compared\non calibrated resistance standards.\nHere we present a simple method that allows the calibration of the ratio of a DCCT by using commercial\ncomponents, originally designed for the calibration of low-value resistors. This method does not require\ncalibrated resistance standards; the accuracy, dependenton the primary current, is better than3 × 10−7\nfor currents below100 A. An example of calibration of a DCCT having a1500 : 1 nominal ratio for\ncurrents up to900 A is reported.\nThe implementation is being employed in the EURAMET.EM-S35High DC current ratio supplemen-\ntary comparison [13], in which INRIM acts as co-pilot laboratory.\n2. CALIBRATION METHOD\nFig. 1 shows the schematic diagram of the calibration setup which includes three current ratio devices:\nthe DCCT under calibration, an automated current range extender EXT and a current comparator ratio\nbridge CC.\n∗ Luca Callegaro, Cristina Cassiago and Enrico Gasparotto are with the Electromagnetism Division of the Istituto Nazionale di\nRicerca Metrologica (INRIM), Strada delle Cacce 91, 10135 Torino, Italy, e-mail:l.callegaro@inrim.it\n† In press on IEEE Trans.

Theammeter A D monitors the DCCT outputID , while\nA C measures the currentIC which is the input quantity of the measurement model(2).\n2.1. OPERATION OF CURRENT RATIO DEVICES\nThe operation of the three current ratio devices, sketched in Fig. 2, is based on the same principle.\nm + 1 windings are wound around a ferromagnetic core. Each winding k hasNk (k = 0 . . . m ) turns,\nand a currentIk ﬂows through it. The magnetic ﬂuxΦ in the core is given byRΦ = ∑ m\nk=0 NkIk,\nwhere R is the core magnetic reluctance.Φ is measured by a ﬂuxgate detector [1, 14, 15] whose output\nconstitutes the error signal of a feedback control. The output of the control drives current sourceI0,\nconnected to winding0, to null the ﬂux. The conditionΦ = 0 yields the ampere-turns balance equation∑ m\nk=0 NkIk = 0 .\nIn normal operating conditions, DCCT and EXT have only two (m = 1 ) active windings. The output\nI0 of the controlled current source constitutes the device output current; hence, the currentI1 is scaled\ndown with the turns ration1,0 = N1/N 0 asI0 = n1,0I1.\nIn the CC, instead, more windings (m ≥ 2) are simultaneously active; the currentsIk (k = 0 . . . m ) are\ncompared, weighted by their respective turn numbersNk; the measurement ofI0 gives the CC reading,\nthat is, the residual unbalance between the currentsI1 . . . I m to be compared.\n2.2. CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION\nThe input windings of both DCCT and EXT are connected in series and driven by the primary current\nIP generated by the high-current dc source S. The DCCT and EXT output currents are respectively\nID = GD IP and IE = GE IP, whereGD is the DCCT current gain (that is, the measurand) andGE is the\nI1 Ik\nI0\nN1 Nk\nΦ\nRB\nN0\nFigure 2: The operating principle of the instruments employed in the calibration setup.m + 1 windings, withNk\n(k = 0 . . . m ) turns each, are wound around a ferromagnetic core (black thick line). The ﬂux detectorΦ , through\nan automatic control (not shown), steers the current sourceI0 untilΦ = 0 ; a generic loadRL can be connected to\nthe source.\nEXT current gain.\nID and IE are connected to two input windings of CC, each havingND and NE turns.ID is also\nmeasured by a high-accuracy ammeter AD .\nThe CC compensation currentIC , linked to the CC winding withNC turns, is measured by the ammeter\nA C ; when operating properly, the CC balance equation is\nNE IE + ND ID + NC IC = 0 . (1)\nIn (1), the sign of turn numbersNx can be either positive or negative and is set by the winding direction.\nWhen in all current ratio devices each core ﬂux is drawn to zero by the corresponding automated control,\nthe balance equation of the whole circuit becomes\nGD = IC\nIP\nNC\nND\n− GE\nNE\nND\n. (2)\n2.3. MEASUREMENT MODEL\nTo derive an accurate measurement model, two major nonidealities of the devices employed should be\nconsidered:\nOFFSET\nAll instruments based on the ﬂuxgate technique suffer from acertain degree of dc offset, caused by the\nmagnetization hysteresis and relaxation of the ferromagnetic core. This offset, of the order of10 µA per\nunit input turn [14], depends on temperature, measurement history and time drifts. To compensate this\noffset, the readingIC in (2) is substituted with∆ IC = IC − IC0 , whereIC is the reading taken at the\nnominal primary currentI(n)\nP of interest, andIC0 is the reading with null primary current,IP = 0 .\nRATIO ERRORS\nThe actual current ratios of CC can differ from the corresponding turn ratios. We callnCD and nED the\ncurrent ratios of whichNC /N D and NE /N D are the corresponding nominal turn ratios.\nFigure 3: A photo of the implementation of the calibration method. See Sec. 3. and Fig. 1 for the identiﬁcation of\nthe labels.\nTaking into account the above nonidealities, (2) can be rewritten as\nGD = ∆ IC\nIP\nnCD − GE nED , (3)\nThe relative gain errorδGD with respect to the nominal gainG(n)\nD is\nδGD = GD − G(n)\nD\nG(n)\nD\n. (4)\n3. IMPLEMENTATION\nFig. 3 shows an implementation of the schematic diagram of Fig. 1. It employs the following instru-\nmentation:\nDCCT The device under test, for which the results reported in Sec.4. were obtained, is a LEM\nmod. ITN 900-S ULTRASTAB high-performance current transducer [16]. It handles primary\ncurrents|IP | ≤ 900 A with a nominal current ratioGD = 1 / 1500. The speciﬁed accuracy\nis better than2 × 10−5 (including offset), the linearity better than1 × 10−6, maximum load\nresistance2. 5 Ω . Fig. 4 shows the DCCT mounted on the primary busbar.\nCC Guildline mod. 9920 direct current comparator [14]. This instrument is particularly versatile since\nit provides several ﬁxed windings having decadic (1 to1000) number of turns and one winding\nwith an adjustable number of turns through decade rotary switches; moreover, it allows a full\nreconﬁguration of the connections between the windings andthe internal electronics. The settings\nused in the calibration of the particular DCCT under test are: ND = − 100 (ﬁxed winding),\nNE = 150 (decade winding), andNC = 1 in order to achieve the highest sensitivity in the\nmeasurement ofIC .\nEXT Two different extenders were employed, depending onIP :\n• Measurement International mod. MI 6011B range extender. Primary current|IP | ≤ 100 A,\nnominal ratio1/ 1000, relative accuracy< 1 × 10−7.\n• Measurement International mod. MI 6012M range extender.|IP | ≤ 2 kA, nominal ratio\n1/ 1000, relative accuracy< 2 × 10−6.\nThe above speciﬁcations were validated in the standard operating setup for low-valued resistor\nmeasurements [17].\nS Two different sources were employed, depending on the primary currentIP:\nFigure 4: The DCCT under calibration mounted on the primary current busbar. The aluminum block in foreground\nembeds a Pt100 sensor to monitor the temperature of the primary current busbar.\n• Measurement International MI 6100A linear dc power supply,for|IP | < 100 A.

Current reversal is achieved\nwith a Measurement International mod. 6025 pneumatic switch.\nA D Agilent mod. 3458A multimeter in dc voltage mode, measuringthe voltage drop on a Tinsley\nmod. 16591 Ω standard resistor.\nA C Agilent mod. 3458A multimeter in dc current mode,100 mA range.\nThe DCCT and busbar temperatures are monitored with two Pt100 platinum temperature sensors (see\nFig. 4) read by a Fluke mod. 1529 CHUB E-4 thermometer.\n4. RESULTS\nAfter a warming-up period of about1 h atIP = + I(n)\nP ,IP is repeatedly cycled between values0,+I(n)\nP ,\n0,− I(n)\nP (ending the whole cycle sequence withIP = 0 ).1 The readingIC is continuously recorded.\nFig. 5 shows a time series ofIC readings corresponding to anIP cycle. For each value ofIP , after\ntransients have died out, a time average\nIC (IP) is computed (see gray bands in Fig. 5).\nThe quantity∆ IC to be employed in Eq. (2) is computed as∆ IC (I(n)\nP ) = IC (I(n)\nP ) − (I′\nC (0) + I′′\nC (0))/ 2,\nwhere I′\nC (0) and I′′\nC (0) are the zero readings respectively preceding and succeeding IC (I(n)\nP ) in the time\nseries.\n1It has been found that, for the particular DCCT being tested and forIP near fullscale, the current must be ramped up smoothly\nto allow the DCCT automatic shutdown.\nFigure 5: Time recording of the compensation currentIC for different primary currentsIP .\nTable 1: DCCT gainGD for different primary currentsIP .

CONCLUSIONS\nThe proposed setup allows the calibration of the ratio of a DCCT with accuracies in the10−6 range\nor better. The proposed implementation, suitable for primary currents up to2 kA, is based on com-\nmercial instruments typically employed for the calibration of low-valued resistors, and therefore often\navailable in calibration laboratories. The implementation is being employed for the participation to the\nEURAMET.EM-S35 comparison, which is co-piloted by INRIM and the Federal Institute of Metrol-\nogy (METAS), Switzerland. The travelling standard of comparison is based on a LEM mod. IT 600-S\nULTRASTAB transducer; the participants measureGD at primary currentsIP =± 90 A, ± 300 A and\n± 600 A. The preliminary characterizations of the travelling standard performed by INRIM and METAS\ngive results which are in agreement within a compound relative uncertainty better than5 × 10−6. At\nthe present time the results of the comparison are conﬁdential; a full validation of the INRIM method\nFigure 6: The relative gain errorδGD of the DCCT under calibration, for different nominal primary current values\nI(n)\nP .
