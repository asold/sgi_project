  "abstract": "Augmented Reality(AR) is growing as an acme of the cutting edge developments in the field of human computer interaction. There is a great potential in AR environments to serve as teaching aids in complementing and improving communication as not everyone is gifted to share their thoughts vocally(deaf-mute) due to physical in capacities.Keeping a pace with advent of technology there is a desperate need of cost-effective devices which could convert Hindi (one of the widely-used languages in India) Varnamala to sign gestures using 3D animated hand movements, to establish an independent learning as well communication facility for deaf/mute. The objective of this study was to create an AR application which could present 3D animated sign gesture on mobile system. When the camera is focused on a media-card, the letter marked on card will be spotted by the application and an animated 3D hand movement for the respective letter will be displayed in real-time.A quasi experimental design was used to assess the efficacy of the system and its resultant learning outcome. Evocative statistics were amended to investigate the data from the deployment of prototype. Experimental outcomes demonstrated a substantial improvement in sign language learning of the deaf-mute students. The initial hypothesis of augmented sign learning is effectually attained in this work and it can be further prolonged to cater to a wider assortment of teaching-learning scenarios.",
