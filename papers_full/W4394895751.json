    "abstract": "This article explores the impact of large language models (LLMs) on social media communication, with a focus on the spread of misinformation and cyberbullying. As social media becomes an integral part of modern life, challenges such as the rapid spread of misinformation and unethical online behavior continue to escalate. In this paper, the lab's main research delves into how large language models can improve the accuracy of information dissemination on platforms such as Twitter with their advanced capabilities and larger parameters. It also highlights the application of LLMs in identifying and filtering misinformation, as well as potential ethical and privacy considerations associated with their use. The studies mentioned here also explore the impact of LLMs in shaping social media communications, addressing technological advancements, and attendant social responsibilities.",
