    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose To study the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in developing diabetic macular edema (DME) management recommendations by creating and comparing responses to clinicians in hypothetical AI-generated case scenarios. The study also examined whether its joint recommendations followed national DME management guidelines. Methods The AI hypothetically generated 50 ocular case scenarios from 25 patients using keywords like age, gender, type, duration and control of diabetes, visual acuity, lens status, retinopathy stage, coexisting ocular and systemic co-morbidities, and DME-related retinal imaging findings. For DME and ocular co-morbidity management, we calculated inter-rater agreements (kappa analysis) separately for clinician responses, AI-platforms, and the “majority clinician response” (the maximum number of identical clinician responses) and “majority AI-platform” (the maximum number of identical AI responses). Treatment recommendations for various situations were compared to the Indian national guidelines. Results For DME management, clinicians (ĸ=0.6), AI platforms (ĸ=0.58), and the ‘majority clinician response’ and ‘majority AI response’ (ĸ=0.69) had moderate to substantial inter-rate agreement. The study showed fair to substantial agreement for ocular co-morbidity management between clinicians (ĸ=0.8), AI platforms (ĸ=0.36), and the ‘majority clinician response’ and ‘majority AI response’ (ĸ=0.49). Many of the current study’s recommendations and national clinical guidelines agreed and disagreed. When treating center-involving DME with very good visual acuity, lattice degeneration, renal disease, anaemia, and a recent history of cardiovascular disease, there were clear disagreements. Conclusion For the first time, this study recommends DME management using large language model-based generative AI. The study’s findings could guide in revising the global DME management guidelines.",

International Journal of Retina and Vitreous            (2024) 10:22 \nIntroduction\nDiabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the many serious eye \ncomplications associated with diabetes mellitus [ 1, 2]. \nDiabetic macular edema (DME) is one of two reasons \nfor sight-threatening DR, the other being proliferative \nDR. In India, the prevalence of DME is less than 10% \n(range: 2.4 − 8.9%) [3–6]. The absolute number of people \nwith DME in India is significant due to the rising num -\nber of diabetics. Various treatment modalities exist for \nthe management of DME, and the selection of treatment \ndepends primarily on the availability of retinal specialists \nand treatment facilities, as well as the patient’s economic \nstatus and underlying ocular and systemic conditions [ 7]. \nBecause the prevalence of diabetes mellitus, and thus DR \nand DME, varies across the globe, several countries and \nregions have developed their own independent guide -\nlines for the screening and management of DR and DME \n[8–12]. Similarly, the All-India Ophthalmology Society \n(AIOS) and the Vitreo-Retinal Society of India (VRSI) \n[national guidelines] have collaborated to develop a con -\nsensus statement on the practice points of DME man -\nagement in India, with the objective of describing the \npreferred practice patterns for DME management in dif -\nferent clinical situations [13]. \nSeveral discussions have centered on the potential \nadvantages and disadvantages of incorporating artificial \nintelligence (AI) into medicine, including ophthalmol -\nogy. To date, several papers have been published using \ndeep machine learning-based algorithms to identify and \nguide DME treatment using color fundus photographs \nand optical coherence tomography (OCT) images [ 14–\n17]. Concerns have been raised about data acquisition, \ndata bias, identifying ground truth, comparing different \nalgorithms, machine learning challenges, its applica -\ntion to different groups of people, and human barriers to \nAI adoption in health care [ 18]. A large language model \n(LLM) or natural language processing is a form of gen -\nerative AI algorithm that understands, summarizes, gen -\nerates, and predicts new text-based content using deep \nlearning techniques and massively large data sets [ 19]. \nMany such open source LLM-based generative AI algo -\nrithms are currently freely and easily available, including \nOpenAI’s ChatGPT3.5v and ChatGPT4.0v, BARD from \nGoogle, Bing AI from Microsoft, and others [ 20]. Most \nresearchers and clinicians believe that AIs based on LLM, \nwhen integrated into the electronic health record, could \naid in the development of the best DME treatment strat -\negy [21]. To the best of our knowledge, we could not find \nany literature that explored the role of LLM-based AI in \nDME management.\nThus, the primary objective of this study was to inves -\ntigate the role of AI in formulating treatment recom -\nmendations for DME management by generating and \ncomparing its responses to those of clinicians in differ -\nent AI-generated clinical case situations. The authors also \nintended to compare the recommendations obtained col-\nlectively by clinicians and different AI platforms to the \nnational guidelines for DME management for the case \nsituations described in this study.\nMethods\nThis was a prospectively conducted questionnaire-based \nstudy. The first stage of the study began by asking Chat -\nGPT 3.5v (OpenAI, San Francisco, CA, USA) to generate \n25 hypothetical clinical cases involving diabetes mellitus \nand providing information about the DR and DME sta -\ntus for each eye separately. This was accomplished by \ninstructing the ChatGPT to use the pointers listed below \nwhile creating the clinical case. The following pointers \nwere included: (1) patient demographics - age and gen -\nder; (2) diabetes type, duration, and control; (3) recent \nonset visual symptoms; (4) visual acuity (VA) of both \neyes in Snellen’s format; (5) lens status - whether clear \nlens, cataractous lens, pseudophakia, or aphakia; (6) clin -\nical fundus findings description - include cases of both \nnon-proliferative and proliferative disease; (7) presence \nof systemic co-morbidities such as renal disease, hyper -\ntension, anemia, cardiovascular disease, and a deranged \nlipid profile; (8) co-existing pregnancy for female cases; \n(9) OCT findings on macular edema location i.e., center-\ninvolving DME (CIDME) or non-center-involving DME \n(NCIDME) and central macular thickness of both eyes, \nand (10) fundus fluorescein angiography findings on focal \nor diffuse leakage or macular ischemia, particularly in \nNCIDME cases.\nThe AI generated 25 hypothetical clinical patients and \n50 clinical ocular case situations. They were then pre -\nsented in a text format without any clinical images to a \ngroup of three experts (NR, NKY, SB) from various insti -\ntutions to validate the clinical details and imaging find -\nings in the case scenarios in order to make them appear \nas close to an actual clinical situation as possible. The \nexperts’ recommendations were taken into account. The \nfinal version of the questionnaire identified 13 patients \nwith identical ocular findings in both eyes. Thus, a total \nof 50 hypothetical case scenarios having 37 different \nocular situations in 25 virtual patients was available for \nevaluation and analysis (Supplement 1). The final version \nof the clinical scenarios was then presented to a second \ngroup of five (VP , JC, RKR, PRK, DB) retina specialists/\nclinicians with at least five years of clinical experience in \nKeywords Diabetic macular edema, Management, Guidelines, Diabetic retinopathy, Artificial intelligence\nPage 3 of 12\nChoudhary et al. International Journal of Retina and Vitreous            (2024) 10:22 \nthe field of retina, DR screening, and DME management. \nThese retina specialists worked in a variety of settings, \nincluding government hospitals, independent private \npractices, tertiary eye care hospitals serving both free and \npaying patients, and tertiary eye care corporate hospitals \nserving only paying patients. Clinicians were asked to \nprovide the single best treatment option for each eye in \nthe case scenario, while keeping in mind that the patient \nwas visiting the clinician for the first time for treatment \nand that the focus was on DME and ocular co-morbidity \nmanagement. Any additional treatment for co-existing \nocular co-morbidities like cataract, glaucoma, prolifera -\ntive DR, etc., had to be mentioned separately as well. The \nmaximum number of identical clinician responses in \neach category was used to determine the ‘majority DME \nmanagement response’ and ‘majority ocular co-morbidity \nmanagement response’ for the clinicians. Following that, \nthe same set of clinical case scenarios was presented to \nthree important AI platforms, which included ChatGPT \n3.5v, ChatGPT 4.0v, and Bing AI. The text was fed into \nvarious AI platforms in such a way that the ophthal -\nmologist appeared to be asking the AI for the best rec -\nommended treatment option based on the most recent \navailable guidelines, with separate answers for each eye. \nAfter each case scenario, the AI received no feedback, \nand the case descriptions were entered sequentially with -\nout starting a new chat session. The formal responses for \neach case scenario were documented separately for DME \nmanagement and co-existing ocular co-morbidity man -\nagement based on the results generated by various AI \nplatforms. For each specific case scenario, the ‘majority \nDME management response’ and ‘majority ocular co-\nmorbidity management response’ were determined by \nidentifying the most identical responses among the three \ndistinct AI platforms in each category separately.\nBased on clinician and AI platform responses, a con -\nsensus was reached on the most common response for \neach individual case scenario in order to determine the \noptimal treatment to be followed by a retina special -\nist in specific clinical situations. For each specific case \nscenario, the ‘majority’ DME management and ocular \nco-morbidity management responses were determined \nby identifying the response with the highest frequency \namong clinicians and AI platforms. A total of eight \nresponses were considered, with five coming from clini -\ncians and three from AI platforms (Fig. 1).\nThe AIOS-DR Task Force and the VRSI collectively \npublished a consensus paper on the management of \nDME. The paper suggested treatment guidelines for DME \nmanagement in a variety of clinical situations involv -\ning ocular and systemic co-morbidities. We looked at \nthe treatment practices recommended by our group of \nclinicians and different AI platforms for similar clinical \nsituations described in that paper. For that, the clinical \nsituations from our current case list were divided into 4 \ncategories: (a) DME management in cases with NCIDME; \n(b) DME management in cases with treatment-naïve \nand previously treated CIDME; (c) DME management \nin cases with co-existing ocular co-morbidities and (d) \nDME management in cases with co-existing systemic \nco-morbidities. The purpose of this exercise was to see \nif recommendations suggested collectively by the clini -\ncians and different AI platforms were consistent with the \nNational guidelines for DME management.\nGiven the nature of the study, this research was \nexempted from further approvals by the institutional \nreview board.\nStatistical analysis\nThe inter-rater reliability agreements among vari -\nous clinicians, different AI platforms, and the ‘majority \nresponse’ for AI and clinician, separately for DME man -\nagement and co-existing ocular co-morbidity manage -\nment, were determined using Fleiss Kappa and Cohen’s \nKappa (ĸ values) analysis.

Treatment with an intravit -\nreal antiVEGF agent was the only preferred treatment of \nchoice in eyes with significant cataract for the manage -\nment of DME. Cataract surgery was not considered in \nany of the ten eyes at the same time as intravitreal injec -\ntion. None of the eyes with CIDME in the current case \nlist had co-existing glaucoma. In the current case list, \nthere was only one eye (5%) with CIDME that had pre -\nviously undergone pars plana vitrectomy surgery. There \nwere 2 (9%) eyes in the current study who had CIDME \nand co-existing peripheral lattice degeneration. Prophy -\nlactic barrage laser was not advised in both these cases \nprior to treatment with intravitreal injections.\n4. Management of CIDME with co-existing systemic \nabnormalities:\nThere were 15 (68%) eyes with CIDME in the current \nlist of case scenarios that had poor diabetes control, \ni.e., HbA1c > 6.5%. In none of the clinical situations was \nDME management withheld in order to achieve meta -\nbolic control of diabetes. There were eleven (50%) eyes \nthat had CIDME as well as renal disease and anemia. In \nsuch eyes, the most preferred treatment for CIDME was \nintravitreal antiVEGF agents in 8 eyes (73%) and intravit -\nreal steroids in 3 (27%) eyes. In no case was DME treat -\nment postponed to allow for renal status control. There \nwere 18 (82%) eyes of CIDME with co-existing hyperten -\nsion on the current list of cases. According to the clini -\ncians’ and AI’s joint recommendations, treatment for \nCIDME with hypertension in the form of macular laser \nor intravitreal injections was considered immediately. \nThere were five (23%) eyes with CIDME and a pregnancy. \nIn these eyes, DME was treated with either a macular \nlaser in four (80%) of them or intravitreal steroids in one \n(20%). In eyes with CIDME and concurrent pregnancy, \nan intravitreal antiVEGF agent was not considered the \nbest treatment option. Thirteen (43%) of the current \ncases had DME and a history of cardiovascular disease. \nEleven (50%) of these eyes had CIDME, and three (27%) \nof them had a history of cardiovascular disease within the \nprevious three months. In patients with cardiovascular \ndisease, regardless of its recent history, intravitreal anti -\nVEGF injections were the preferred treatment option.\nDiscussion\nIn summary, this one-of-a-kind study involved noting \ntreatment suggestions for DME and ocular co-morbidity \nmanagement separately to a set of ocular case scenarios \ngenerated by the AI, comparing the responses provided \nby clinicians and different AI platforms to different clini -\ncal situations, and finally match the collective responses \nprovided by the different AI platforms and clinicians to \ndifferent clinical situations with the previously published \nrecommendations by the AIOS-DR Task Force and the \nVRSI.\nThe prevalence of DME, as well as the availability of \ntrained medical personnel, retinal imaging tools, and \nmanagement options, varies by geographic region [ 4, \n23, 24]. Furthermore, treatment practices differ signifi -\ncantly within a defined region based on a variety of fac -\ntors such as the type of patient (urban versus rural), the \npatient’s economic status and countries resource settings, \nand the availability of treatment options such as intravit -\nreal injections or lasers. As a result, different parts of the \nworld establish their own treatment guidelines for DME \nmanagement [8–13]. The International Council of Oph -\nthalmology Guidelines for Diabetic Eye Care 2017 sum -\nmarised and provided a comprehensive guide for DR \nscreening, referral and follow-up schedules, and appro -\npriate management of vision-threatening DR, including \nDME and proliferative DR, for countries with high, low, \nor intermediate resource levels [ 25]. We found varying \nlevels of agreement among clinicians in this study for the \nmanagement of DME as well as the management of ocu -\nlar co-morbidities. The clinicians who participated in this \nstudy provided responses from different regions of the \ncountry, treating different groups of patients with vary -\ning social and economic backgrounds, which explains the \nvarying levels of agreement among the clinicians.\nThe current role of AI in DME management is primar -\nily limited to identifying and classifying DME using color \nfundus photographs and/or optical coherence tomogra -\nphy images, as well as predicting the response to anti -\nVEGF therapy using machine learning or deep learning \nmodels [ 14, 15, 26]. Several chatbots developed using \nLLM-based generative AI applications have shown prom-\nising results in generalizing to previously unseen tasks, \nsuch as medical question-answering requiring scientific \nexpert knowledge [27–29]. LLM understands the medical \ncontext, recalls and interprets relevant medical informa -\ntion, and produces a response in a text-based format in \norder to formulate an answer. Despite mixed results in \nophthalmology, LLM appears to have potential for use \nin eye health care applications. LLM-based generative AI \nwith ChatGPT3.5v and ChatGPT 4.0v has been used in \nretina for a variety of indications, including ICD for vari -\nous case encounters [30, 31]. The use of LLM-based gen -\nerative AI for DME management recommendations in \nthe presence of other ocular co-morbidities has yet to be \ninvestigated. Furthermore, different chatbot applications \nreact differently to the same situations [ 32]. Even in this \nstudy, the different AI platforms demonstrated varying \nlevels of agreement for the same clinical case scenario. \nThere was moderate agreement among the different AI \nplatforms for the management of DME and fair agree -\nment for the management of co-existing ocular morbidi -\nties. To address this issue, the ‘majority AI response’ was \nPage 8 of 12\nChoudhary et al. International Journal of Retina and Vitreous            (2024) 10:22 \nchosen as the preferred method for managing the DME \nusing AI. To improve both the precision and speed of \nresponses, the AI platform must have real-time access \nto the internet and receive the most up-to-date infor -\nmation. In this study, we discovered that ChatGPT 4.0v \nperformed better and had closer agreements with clini -\ncian responses than the other two AI platforms for DME \nmanagement, while ChatGPT3.5v performed better for \nco-existing ocular comorbidities management.\nA complete ophthalmic examination, as well as a \nthorough ocular and systemic history, are required for \nDME management. Most globally accepted treatment \nguidelines for DME management available in the lit -\nerature, including protocols developed by the Diabetic \nRetinopathy Clinical Research Network (DRCR.net), use \nlimited criteria for guiding DME treatment, such as met -\nabolic control status, VA, treatment-naive status, and the \ninvolvement of a 1-mm central subfield region on OCT \nby retinal thickening [ 8–13, 33, 34]. The AIOS-DR Task \nForce and the VRSI recently published consensus guide -\nlines in 2021 that looked at some additional criteria such \nas the presence of co-existing ocular and systemic co-\nmorbidities in addition to the above-mentioned criteria \nwhen planning DME management [ 13]. As a result, we \ncompared the recommendations made by the clinicians \nand AI in this study for various clinical case scenarios to \nthe consensus recommendations made by the AIOS-DR \nTask Force and the VRSI.\nAccording to the current study recommendations, \nmost eyes with NCIDME and good VA (i.e., 20/30) were \nonly observed or rarely treated with topical non-steroidal \nanti-inflammatory drugs. According to the recommen -\ndations of the AIOS-DR Task Force and the VRSI, eyes \nwith good VA should be observed and followed up on \nat monthly intervals to look for conversion to CIDME \nor deterioration in VA [ 13]. According to protocol R of \nthe DRCR.net, topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory \ndrugs have no noticeable effect in eyes with NCIDME \nand good VA [35]. \nIntravitreal antiVEGF injections are the first line of \ntreatment for naive CIDME [ 36, 37]. VA is the most \nimportant criterion for deciding to initiate treatment, \nselecting the right intravitreal pharmacotherapeutic \nantiVEGF agent for its management, and for prognosis \npurposes, according to most well-established DME treat -\nment guidelines [ 8–13, 33, 34]. According to DRCR.net \nprotocol V, eyes with treatment-naive CIDME and very \ngood VA, i.e., ≥ 20/30, can be observed and followed up \non a monthly basis instead of being treated with intravit -\nreal antiVEGF injections [38]. In practice, however, treat-\nment of naive CIDME eyes with very good VA is typically \ninitiated with intravitreal antiVEGF injections only if the \npatient complains of visual symptoms. Intravitreal anti -\nVEGF agents are typically used to treat naive CIDME \neyes with VA below 20/30. The presenting VA also influ -\nences the choice of antiVEGF agents; for example, in eyes \nwith acuity ≤ 20/50, intravitreal aflibercept injection is the \npreferred treatment option [ 39]. Regardless of present -\ning VA or patient visual symptoms, intravitreal antiVEGF \ninjection was the only preferred treatment option in the \ncurrent study recommendations for naive CIDME eyes. \nIn the current study, intravitreal injections, either with \nantiVEGF agents or steroids, remained the mainstay of \nDME management for previously treated CIDME eyes. \nIntravitreal steroids are typically reserved for eyes that \nhave persistent DME or do not respond to monthly anti -\nVEGF injections [40, 41]. \nProliferative DR and DME are both distinct patterns \nof retinal microvascular features indicative of small-ves -\nsel disease. Treatment-naive proliferative DR should be \ntreated with pan-retinal photocoagulation, according to \nthe AIOS-DR Task Force and the VRSI guidelines [ 13]. \nThe presence or absence of vision-threatening traction \ndetermines the management regime of CIDME treat -\nment in proliferative DR eyes. Traction that threatens or \ninvolves the fovea is an indication for vitrectomy surgery. \nIntravitreal injections, however, remain the mainstay of \nDME treatment in the presence of extramacular traction \n[42]. Intravitreal steroids are usually preferred in prolif -\nerative DR and DME eyes with extensive extramacular \nproliferations because intravitreal antiVEGF injections \ncan worsen traction due to the crunch phenomenon \n[43]. The current study suggests that eyes with DME and \nproliferative DR without advanced fibrovascular prolif -\neration be treated with intravitreal antiVEGF injections, \nwhereas intravitreal steroid injections are preferred in \nDME eyes with proliferative DR and extensive fibrovas -\ncular proliferation.\nThe current study included a high proportion of cases \nwith clear lenses, cataractous lenses, and pseudophakia, \nall of which co-existed with CIDME. In the absence of a \nvisually disabling cataract, the AIOS-DR Task Force and \nthe VRSI recommend that DME be stabilized first with \nintravitreal injections. However, in the presence of clini -\ncally significant cataracts with a poor view of the fundus, \nand preexisting DME, surgery along with intravitreal \nantiVEGF or steroid injections can be planned. In some \ncases, treatment can be scheduled two weeks after sur -\ngery and the subsequent protocol be followed [ 13]. The \ncurrent study considered treating DME with intravitreal \nantiVEGF injections prior to cataract surgery. Vision in \nthe study’s case scenarios ranged from 20/25 to 20/80, \nindicating moderate vision loss and visually insignificant \ncataract. This could be the reason why these eyes were \ntreated for DME prior to cataract surgery rather than \nconcurrently with cataract surgery. In the current study, \nintravitreal steroids were the preferred choice for DME \nmanagement in pseudophakic eyes in two-thirds of the \nPage 9 of 12\nChoudhary et al. International Journal of Retina and Vitreous            (2024) 10:22 \ncases. According to national guidelines, the first step is \nto determine whether the macular edema in pseudopha -\nkic eyes is caused by DME or by Irvine-Gass syndrome. \nIn the presence of DME without the presence of Irvine-\nGass syndrome, treatment with antiVEGF injections can \nbe initiated for CIDME, whereas topical or sub tenon’s \nsteroids are recommended as first-line therapy for pseu -\ndophakic edema. Topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory \ndrugs should be used first, followed by antiVEGF, in the \npresence of both DME and Irvine-Gass syndrome. It \nis reasonable to switch to steroids in eyes that have not \nresponded to previous antiVEGF injections (after 3–6 \ninjections) [ 13]. Many international experts around the \nworld believe that intravitreal steroids injection with \ndexamethasone implant is a viable alternative first-line \ntreatment option, particularly in pseudophakic eyes [44]. \nNational guidelines recommend treating DME in eyes \nwith established glaucoma, ocular hypertension, or ste -\nroid responders with either macular laser or antiVEGF \ninjections. In these patients, steroids should be avoided \n[13]. There were no cases of CIDME and co-existing glau-\ncoma in the current study’s case scenarios. As a result, \ncomparisons with the National guidelines were not pos -\nsible in this study. According to experts affiliated with the \nNational guidelines, careful examination of the retinal \nperiphery for identifying lesions that may predispose to \nretinal detachment, as well as prophylactic barrage laser \ntreatment of those lesions, is recommended. In addition, \nthe time between laser prophylaxis and antiVEGF injec -\ntions should ideally be three weeks [ 13]. However, the \ncurrent study’s joint experts (AI and clinicians) did not \nrecommend prophylactic laser barrage to lattice degen -\nerations prior to beginning DME treatment with intravit-\nreal injections.\nDME treatment in a vitrectomised eye is difficult. \nThere is limited data on the preferred agent for treatment \nin these eyes. Furthermore, as the environment of the vit-\nreous cavity changes, the pharmacokinetic parameters of \nantiVEGF may be affected. A recent study comparing the \nefficacy of ranibizumab injections for the treatment of \nDME in eyes with and without previous vitrectomy over \na two-year period found similar results [ 45]. In a similar \nstudy, Koyanagi et al. found no significant differences in \nthe mean changes in VA and central macular thickness \nbetween the two groups after 6 months [ 46]. However, \nsome studies show that intravitreal antiVEGF injections \nhave a lower efficacy in vitrectomised eyes [ 47]. Intravit-\nreal dexamethasone implant has also been shown to be \neffective in both vitrectomised and non-vitrectomised \neyes [ 48, 49]. Thus, current evidence suggests that both \nantiVEGF and steroids have a role in the treatment of \nDME in vitrectomised eyes.\nPoor glycemic control is a risk factor for the progres -\nsion of DR and DME. Strict glycemic control is beneficial \nat any stage of diabetes. Poor or fluctuating glycemic con-\ntrol can affect adherence to monthly intravitreal injec -\ntions. However, in order to achieve good glycemic \ncontrol, DME management should not be delayed. In the \ncurrent study, DME management was not postponed in \ncases of poor diabetes control.\nLittle is known about the treatment of DME during \npregnancy [ 50]. According to experts, watchful waiting \nmay be used in cases of mild to moderate DME because \nthe outcomes are similar in patients who receive prompt \nversus delayed DME treatment [ 51]. Because of poten -\ntial adverse effects on developing embryos or foetuses, \nintravitreal antiVEGF injections are not recommended \nduring pregnancy. Women should therefore wait at least \nthree months after their last intravitreal injection before \nconceiving. Ranibizumab is usually preferred over other \nantiVEGF agents because of its shorter half-life and faster \nplasma clearance [52]. When the disease permits it, focal \nlaser or intravitreal steroids are the preferred treatment \noptions for DME in pregnancy [50, 51]. \nThe current study’s clinicians and AI jointly proposed \nthe use of intravitreal antiVEGF or steroid injection in \neyes with CIDME and deranged renal status. Diabetic \nnephropathy is often associated with other systemic \nco-morbidities that affect DME. Secondary hyperten -\nsion, anemia, patients on or after dialysis, and renal \ntransplantation, for example, may all have an impact \non the presence of DME and its management [ 53–55]. \nVEGF inhibitors may have nephrotoxic effects, accord -\ning to emerging evidence [ 56]. However, a recent study \npublished by Ku et al. found no correlation between the \nuse of intravitreal antiVEGF injections and a decrease in \nestimated glomerular filtration rate [ 57]. Several DME \ntreatment guidelines recommend identifying the cause \nof hypertension and controlling it before beginning treat-\nment with intravitreal antiVEGF injections [ 8, 9, 12, 13]. \nAntiVEGF injections are effective in eyes with DME and \nwell-controlled hypertension [ 58]. According to studies, \npatients with DME or proliferative DR are more likely to \nhave incident or fatal cardiovascular disease than those \nwho do not have DME or PDR [ 59]. If a patient has had \na stroke or myocardial infarction within the previous \n3 months, the AIOS-DR Task Force and the VRSI rec -\nommend that antiVEGF treatment be avoided; instead, \nPRP or steroid treatments should be considered in these \npatients [ 13]. However, a recent systematic review and \nmeta-analysis published by Ngo Ntjam et al. examined \nthe incidence of major cardiovascular adverse events in \npatients receiving intravitreal administration of anti-vas -\ncular endothelial growth factor drugs. They confirmed \nthat intravitreal antiVEGF injections did not cause seri -\nous cardiovascular events [ 60]. Even in this study, intra -\nvitreal antiVEGF injections were the preferred treatment \noption in DME patients with a history of cardiovascular \nPage 10 of 12\nChoudhary et al.

Table  3 summarizes study’s joint recommenda -\ntions for managing DME and provides comparisons with \nthe national recommendations for DME management.\nThere are a few weaknesses with this study. Regarding \nthe clinical case scenarios generated by the AI, the num -\nber of case scenarios provided could have been greater, \ntaking into account all possible permutations and com -\nbinations involving the DME status, as well as the ocu -\nlar and systemic co-morbidity status. The clinical case \nscenarios could have been presented to a larger group of \nclinicians on a national and international scale, as well \nas to multiple AI applications. The term ‘majority’ cli -\nnician and AI responses used in this study may mislead \nreaders and be misinterpreted as the best response from \nthe entire fraternity of retina specialists and different \nAI platforms. In the current study, the AI and clinician \nresponses were only compared to the National guide -\nlines proposed by a group of experts affiliated with the \nAIOS-DR Task Force and the VRSI. The current study’s \nrecommendations could have been compared to interna -\ntional DME management guidelines, making the study’s \nfindings more globally acceptable. Nonetheless, the study \nhas the advantage of adding a completely new dimen -\nsion to the formulation of DME treatment guidelines \nby incorporating the role of LLM-based generative AI. \nThe study also emphasizes the importance of consider -\ning the patient’s eye and body as a whole when planning \nDME management. It is possible to make these recom -\nmendations globally acceptable by addressing the afore -\nmentioned flaws in future DME and AI-related studies. \nFurthermore, in the future, these globally acceptable \nDME management recommendations could be integrated \nwith the hospital’s electronic medical record system, \nalerting ophthalmologists to the best possible treatment \noption after considering the various factors that may \ninfluence DME developments and management. The AI \nhas the capability to analyse and assess its recommen -\ndations based on the specific approaches used by differ -\nent clinicians for managing DME by setting up prompts \non the electronic medical record. In the future, AI will \nincorporate self-learning algorithms tailored to each cli -\nnician’s practices, allowing the algorithm to learn from \na clinician’s recommendations for a particular patient. \nThis adaptive learning process will help enhance the algo-\nrithm’s performance.\nIn conclusion, this study highlights the significance of \nAI in aiding experts in revising the existing treatment \nguidelines for managing DME. An optimal approach \nfor the future would involve merging these treatment \nguidelines with the hospital’s electronic medical record \nsoftware, enabling clinicians to promptly select the most \neffective treatment option for managing DME.\nAbbreviations\nDME  diabetic macular edema\nDR  diabetic retinopathy\nAI  artificial intelligence\nLLM  large language model\nAIOS  All-India Ophthalmological Society\nVRSI  Vitreo-Retina Society of India\nOCT  optical coherence tomography\nVA  visual acuity\nCIDME  center-involving diabetic macular edema\nNCIDME  non-center involving diabetic macular edema\nVEGF  vascular endothelial growth factor\nDRCR.net  Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at https://doi.\norg/10.1186/s40942-024-00544-6.\nSupplementary Material 1\nAcknowledgements\nNone.\nAuthors contributions\nRV, RS– conceptualising the study, data acquisition, analysing the data, \nstatistics and results, interpreting the findings, writing & reviewing the \nmanuscript.
