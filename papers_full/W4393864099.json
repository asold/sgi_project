This progression \nadheres to a systematic process encompassing power generation, transmission, and distribution. \nThe sequence initiates at the power plant, where electricity is generated and subsequently \ntransferred through a series of components: from th e Power Plant to the Transmission Sub -\nStation then to Distribution Sub-Station, and ultimately reaching Homes, Offices, and Industries \n(Sa'ad, 2018).  \nWithout the transmission link, the sequential movement of electricity from generating plants to \nthe final users can not be achieved as it provides a platform for the evacuation of electricity \nfrom the generating companies (Gencos) to the distribution netwo rk for onward transmission \nto final users. \nThe operational and maintenance responsibilities for Nigeria's transmission network lie with \nthe Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN), a government-owned corporation established in \n2004 (Sa'ad, 2018). This transmission network is intricately linked to diverse regional networks, \nfacilitating the seamless exchange of electricity between states and regions. This interconnected \nstructure plays a pivotal role in guaranteeing a dependable power supply across different parts \nof the country and Rivers state in par ticular, while optimizing the utilization of generated \nelectricity. Comprising high -voltage transmission lines and substations, the Nigerian \ntransmission network is a critical component of the nation's electrical infrastructure (Sa'ad, \n2018). The transmission lines have a voltage rating of 132kV and 330kV, which allow for the \nlong-distance transmission of electricity. These lines are made of conductors and supported by \ntransmission towers to ensure their stability and reliability. The substat ions are integral part of \nEngineering Science & Technology Journal, Volume 5, Issue 4, April 2024 \n \nOkeke, Ibokette, Ijiga, Anebi, Ebiega, & Olumubo,  P.No. 1149-1172 Page 1151 \nthe transmission network as they facilitate the transformation and control of electricity at \ndifferent voltage levels. Electricity from power plants or other substations are received by these \nsubstations and step up the voltage to transmit it over long distances. Substations also regulate \nthe voltage, provide protection mechanisms, and enable the transfer of electricity to different \ndistribution networks. To ensure the efficient and reliable operation of the transmission \nnetwork, TCN employs various technol ogies and control systems. These include Supervisory \nControl and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, which monitor and control the network in \nreal-time. SCADA systems provide important information about the status of transmission \nlines, substations, and transformers, allowing for timely response to faults or disruptions. They \nalso help in load balancing, optimizing network performance, and preventing grid instability \n(NERC, https://www.nercng.org/). \nIn order to achieve efficient transmission, a number of equipment (Transformers, circuit \nbreakers, isolators, Isolators, shunt reactors, earthing switches etc) are needed and must be \nreliable, one of which is the Power transformers which are undoubtedly th e most important \nequipment in the transmission stations (Sa’ad, 2018 et al). \nA Power transformer, an electrical apparatus utilizing electromagnetic induction, facilitates the \ntransfer of electrical energy between multiple circuits. Commonly employed in alternating \ncurrent (AC) electrical power systems, it serves the purpose of eith er stepping up or stepping \ndown voltage levels (Wikipedia, 2021)  as shown in the schematic diagram of types of \ntransformers in Fig. 1 . The reliability of powe r transformers is crucial to ensuring an \nuninterrupted power supply from the transmission network to consumers. They consist of a \ncomponent consisting of a core with magnetic permeability and a series of windings, which are \ninsulated conductors with low resistance wrapped around the core, a cooling and insulation \narrangement that includes insulation paper and mineral oil surrounding the active portion and a \ntransformer tank, connection terminals, and related accessories (Adewuyi et al 2016 ).  \n \nFigure. 1: Schematic Diagram of Types of Transformers. \nSource: https://www.researchgate.net  \n\nEngineering Science & Technology Journal, Volume 5, Issue 4, April 2024 \n \nOkeke, Ibokette, Ijiga, Anebi, Ebiega, & Olumubo,  P.No. 1149-1172 Page 1152 \nAs shown in the schematic diagram of types of transformers in Fig. 1., Power transformers stand \nout as the predominant category of transformers employed in electrical power systems. \nSpecifically engineered for the transfer of electrical energy, they operate at high voltages, \nfacilitating the transmission of power from generat ing facilities to distribution substations. At \nthese substations, the voltage undergoes a reduction to facilitate subsequent distribution to end \nconsumers. Renowned for their substantial size and capacity to manage formidable loads, power \ntransformers play an indispensable role in the efficient transmission and distribution of \nelectricity. Primarily designed for transmission applications, these transformers find application \nin power generation stations, substations, and the interconnection of grids. Power transformers \ncan handle voltages ranging from 110 kV to 765 kV and are responsible for transmitting large \namounts of electricity over long distances. They are usually oil -filled and have higher power \ncapacities compared to distribution transformer. The reliabilities of these power transformers \nare instrumental in improving the quality of power supply in Nigeria and in Rivers state in \nparticular.  \nReliability, defined as the ability of a system to fulfill its intended function without failure over \na specified period, underscores the critical importance of power transformer performance \n(Wikipedia, 2021). In the case of power transformer, this refers to its ability to operate \ncontinuously and reliably under normal operating conditions, without breakdowns or failures. \nTransformers are designed to have a long service life, often exceeding 30 years, and therefore, \ntheir reliability is of paramount importa nce (Oliveira, L. H., 2020). The reliability of a power \ntransformer is influenced by various factors, including design, manufacturing quality, \nmaintenance, and external conditions. A well-designed transformer should be able to withstand \nelectrical, mechani cal, and thermal stresses, while maintaining its integrity and optimal \nperformance. The use of high-quality materials and advanced manufacturing processes helps to \nensure reliability and durability (Adewuyi, Abodunrin, & Aderonmu, 2016). By and large, the \nreliability assessment is basically concerned with the evaluations, estimations or opinions \nformed regarding the attribute (reliability) of an equipment (Power transformers).  \nThe location scope of this study is focused on Rivers State, Nigeria. This particular geographical \narea is chosen because it represents a specific region within Nigeria's Transmission industry. \nInvestigating the reliability of power transformers in Rivers State allows for a more localized \nand context -specific analysis. Factors such as the local climate, infrastructure, maintenance \npractices, and consumer demographics in Rivers State may have unique characteristics and can \nsignificantly impact the reliabilit y of power transformers. By narrowing the study to this \nspecific location, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the challenges and \nopportunities for improving power transformer reliability in Rivers State. The State is located \nin the southern reg ion of Nigeria, along the coastline of the Niger Delta. It lies between \nlongitude 6° 20' east and 8° 50' east, and latitude 4° 20' north and 7° 30' north. The state shares \nboundaries with Imo, Abia, and Akwa Ibom states to the north, Bayelsa State to the w est, and \nthe Atlantic Ocean to the south. It also shares an international boundary with Equatorial Guinea \nto the east. \nIn terms of occupation, Rivers State is an economic powerhouse in Nigeria. It is home to several \nmultinational oil and gas companies, making it the hub of Nigeria's petroleum industry. Other \nsectors such as agriculture, manufacturing, trade, and services a lso contribute to the state's \neconomy. \nEngineering Science & Technology Journal, Volume 5, Issue 4, April 2024 \n \nOkeke, Ibokette, Ijiga, Anebi, Ebiega, & Olumubo,  P.No. 1149-1172 Page 1153 \nThe reliability of power transformers in Rivers state has been a significant concern for \nconsumers in the country. Like many other states, Rivers state faces numerous challenges \nregarding its electricity infrastructure, resulting in frequent power outages and inconsistent \nsupply, affecting economic activities and over all wellbeing of the citizens. \nConsumer expectations have shifted from merely seeking access to electricity to demanding \nhigh-quality, reliable power supply. Thus, the reliability of power transformers has gained \nsignificant attention in recent years, as it directly impacts the welfare and satisfaction of \nconsumers. \nThis research was conducted to understand the Perception and Satisfaction of Electricity \nCustomers on the Reliability of Power Transformers within Rivers State, the Dominant Factors \nAffecting the Reliability of Power Transformers, their Impacts on Customer  Experiences and \nBusinesses and Possible Recommendations on how to improve the existing situation based on \ncustomer feedbacks as well as to develop techniques for assessing and monitoring their \nconditions.  \nSignificance of Power Transformer Reliability in Rivers State. \nThe importance of this investigation concerning the dependability of power transformers within \nthe Rivers State Transmission Network is multifaceted; they find their usefulness among \nelectricity companies, consumers (households, firms, industries and gover nment), policy \nmakers and contribution to literature. \nElectricity Companies:  This study holds significance for electricity providers as it offers \ninsights into consumer perceptions and satisfaction levels regarding power transformer \nreliability. The outcomes can help companies in pinpointing areas for improvement and \ndevising stra tegies to bolster power transformer reliability. Ultimately, this could lead to \nheightened customer satisfaction and loyalty. \nConsumers (Households, Firms, Industries, and Government): Consumers directly feel the \nimpact of power transformer reliability. This research helps consumers grasp the factors \ninfluencing power transformer reliability and evaluate their experiences within the Rivers state \ntransmission network. By articulating the ir viewpoints, consumers can contribute to the \nformulation of effective policies and initiatives aimed at enhancing power transformer \nreliability. \nPolicy Makers: Policy makers wield significant influence in shaping the electricity sector. The \ninsights derived from this study can guide policy makers in crafting regulations and policies \nconducive to promoting power transformer reliability. It also underscores the im portance of \ninvesting in infrastructure and maintenance to ensure a dependable power supply for consumers. \nContribution to Literature: This study enriches the existing literature on power transformer \nreliability within the Nigerian transmission industry by focusing on consumer perspectives. It \noffers a comprehensive analysis of the factors influencing reliability, shedding light on their  \nimpact on consumer experiences and industry performance as a whole. Moreover, the study \nproposes practical recommendations based on consumer feedback, thereby contributing \nvaluable insights to the realm of power system reliability and addressing a gap in understanding \nconsumer perceptions within the Nigerian transmission industry. \nLITERATURE REVIEW \nIn the context of power transformers, reliability is of utmost importance as electricity \ntransmission primarily relies on a stable and efficient power transformer. Power transformers \nEngineering Science & Technology Journal, Volume 5, Issue 4, April 2024 \n \nOkeke, Ibokette, Ijiga, Anebi, Ebiega, & Olumubo,  P.No. 1149-1172 Page 1154 \nare responsible for converting electricity to the desired voltage levels, allowing for transmission \nand distribution across the grid. Therefore, any failures or breakdowns in these transformers \ncan lead to power outages, affecting industries, households, and critical infrastructures. \nReliability Theory  \nThe Reliability Theory offers a systematic approach to evaluate the reliability of power \ntransformers by considering various factors such as design, manufacturing quality, maintenance \npractices, and environmental conditions. It provides tools and technique s to assess the \nprobability of failure, mean time between failures, and overall performance of power \ntransformers. The concept of this theory help power companies to identify weak points in their \ntransformer systems, implement better maintenance practices,  and make informed decisions \nregarding investments in infrastructure improvement (Emmanuel, 2017 ).  \nBy improving the reliability of power transformers, Nigeria can enhance the stability and quality \nof its electricity supply, thereby boosting industrial productivity, attracting investments, and \nimproving the overall living standards of its population. \nElectricity Transmission in Nigeria  \nThe radial transmission grid, incorporating 330kV and 132kV networks, is under the \nmanagement of the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN). TCN is responsible for both \nsystem operation and market settlement functions (Folorunso and Olowu, 2014). This \nextensive network, covering 5523.8km of 330kV and 6801.49km of 132kV transmission lines, \nincludes 32 number 330/132kV substations and 105 132/33/11kV substations as shown in the \nElectricity Transmission Line in Fig. 2 . The total installed transformation  capacity is \n7688MVA for 330/132kV and 9130MVA for 132/33/11kV, with an average available capacity \nof 7364MVA for 330/132kV and 8448MVA for 132/33kV (Folorunso and Olowu, 2014, Labo, \n2010). \nThe Nigerian 330kV transmission grid encounters challenges, primarily notable power losses \nattributed to lengthy transmission lines. These losses diminish power availability to consumers, \nresulting in insufficient power for operating appliances. The escala ting power demand strains \nthe network, potentially reducing its lifespan or leading to a complete collapse (Folorunso and \nOlowu, 2014). The major issues identified in the Nigerian transmission system include \ninsufficient funding, incomplete coverage, limit ed electricity wheeling capacity, outdated \nsections with inadequate redundancies, financial constraints for expansion and maintenance, \nfrequent vandalism, poor voltage stability, inadequate tools and vehicles, lack of modern \ncommunication and monitoring technologies, overloaded transformers, inadequate spare parts, \nand insufficient technical staff recruitment and training (Johnson, B. 2017 ). \nIn an effort to address these challenges, the Power Holding Company of Nigeria underwent \nunbundling, leading to the establishment of the Transmission Company of Nigeria.  \nThe Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) \nThe Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) oversees the electricity transmission network \nwithin the nation and by extension, in Rivers state. It is made up of three operational \ndepartments namely the Transmission Service Provider (TSP), the System Operations (SO) and \nthe Market Operators (MO). \n1. Transmission Service Provider (TSP):  The TSP is responsible for the development and \nmaintenance of the national inter-connected transmission system, managing substations, power \nEngineering Science & Technology Journal, Volume 5, Issue 4, April 2024 \n \nOkeke, Ibokette, Ijiga, Anebi, Ebiega, & Olumubo,  P.No. 1149-1172 Page 1155 \nlines, and providing open access transmission services. Its focus includes the maintenance and \nexpansion of the physical infrastructure constituting the transmission grid. \n2. System Operations (SO): The SO oversees the flow of electricity from generation to \ndistribution companies, operating under the Grid Code for the Nigerian Electricity Supply \nIndustry (NESI). Its key responsibilities involve ensuring the reliability of transmission grid \nlines and m aintaining technical stability through planning, dispatch, and control operations. \nSpecific duties of the SO include: Controlling grid frequency and voltage, allocating power \nloads during insufficient generation, designing, installing, and maintaining Supervisory Control \nand Data Acquisition (SCADA) and  communication facilities, economic dispatch of generating \nunits, procuring and managing ancillary services, enforcing the grid code and operational \nprocedures, coordinating planned outages for system equipment maintenance, conducting post-\nfault analysis of major grid disturbances. \n3. Market Operations (MO): The MO plays a pivotal role in administering the market rules \nwithin the Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry (NESI). Its primary responsibility is to oversee \nthe Electricity Market, ensuring efficiency and adherence to market regulations. The specific \nfunctions of MO include: Implementation and administration of the Nigerian Electricity Market \nRules, drafting and execution of Market Procedures, oversight of the commercial metering \nsystem, ensuring each trading point has appropria te metering systems, management of the \nmarket settlement system, administration of the payment system and commercial arrangements \nwithin the energy market, including ancillary services, supervision of electricity market \nparticipants' compliance with and en forcement of the market rules and the grid code, periodic \nreporting on the implementation of the market rules, capacity building for market participants \non the market rules, procedures, and trading arrangements (Folorunso and Olowu, 2014). \nThe TCN infrastructure is mainly radial, lacking redundancies, leading to inherent reliability \nissues. With transmission losses averaging around 7.4%, these figures are notably high \ncompared to benchmarks set by emerging countries, ranging from 2 -6%. While the number of \nsystem collapses has decreased in recent years, dropping from a peak of 42 in 2010 to a few in \nrecent years, these trends highlight the significant infrastructure and operational challenges \nwithin the transmission subsector of the industry. \n \nFigure 2: Electricity Transmission Line.  \nSource: https://www.researchgate.net  \n\nEngineering Science & Technology Journal, Volume 5, Issue 4, April 2024 \n \nOkeke, Ibokette, Ijiga, Anebi, Ebiega, & Olumubo,  P.No. 1149-1172 Page 1156 \nPower Transformers \nPower transformers represent stationary devices designed for the transfer of electrical energy \nbetween various voltage levels while maintaining a consistent frequency. Comprising multiple \nwindings, namely primary and secondary, these windings remain electr ically isolated but are \nmagnetically interconnected through a shared magnetic core. The primary winding establishes \na connection with the input power source, while the secondary winding delivers power to either \nthe load or another transformer (Oliveira, L.  H. et al 2020 ). \nIn terms of operating principle, the functionality of power transformers hinges on the principle \nof electromagnetic induction. As alternating current (AC) courses through the primary winding, \nit generates a dynamic magnetic field within the iron core. This magnetic field, in accordance \nwith Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction, induces an electromotive force (EMF) in the \nsecondary winding. The voltage transformation ratio of the transformer is determined by the \nratio of turns between the primary and secondary windings (Oliveira, L. H. et al 2020 ). \nTransformer Efficiency, Losses and Factors Contributing to Failure  \nTransformer efficiency pertains to the transformer's capability to convert electrical energy from \none voltage level to another with minimal energy losses. It is a crucial parameter influencing \nthe overall performance and operational expenses of the transfo rmer, essential in various \napplications like power generation, transmission, and distribution systems. \nOperated on electromagnetic induction principles, transformers employ a primary winding \nenergized by alternating current, inducing a voltage in the secondary winding for energy \ntransfer. However, energy losses occur in this process, categorized into copper losses and core \nlosses (Redaelli & De Mello, 2019). \n1. Copper Losses: They occur within the windings and are due to electrical resistance of the \nconductor. They include I²R Losses and eddy current losses. \n(a). I²R Losses:  Arising from winding resistance during load current flow, these losses are \nproportional to the square of the current. Mitigation involves using thicker wires with materials \nfeaturing lower resistivity. \n(b). Eddy Current Losses:  Induced in the winding's laminated structure, these currents \ncirculate within, dissipating energy. Laminated cores made of thin metal sheets reduce eddy \ncurrent losses. \n2. Core Losses: They occur as a result of hysteresis and eddy current losses. \n(a). Hysteresis Losses: Resulting from changes in the core's magnetic field direction, magnetic \ndomains realign, causing energy dissipation. Utilizing materials with lower hysteresis losses, \nlike silicon steel or amorphous alloys, reduces this loss. \n(b). Eddy Current Losses:  Induced by a changing magnetic field, these currents circulate \nwithin the core, causing energy dissipation. Laminated cores effectively minimize these losses. \nThe transformer's overall efficiency is determined by the ratio of output power (Pout) to input \npower (Pin) (Redaelli & De Mello, 2019). Understanding these losses is vital for effective \ntransformer design, operation, and maintenance. \nThe efficiency (η) and the losses (Ph) can be expressed as: η = Pout / Pin = 1 - (Ph / Pin). \nTo achieve high efficiency, transformer design takes into account various factors such as \noptimal sizing of conductors, selecting core materials with low losses, minimizing air gaps, and \nefficient cooling mechanisms. \n \nEngineering Science & Technology Journal, Volume 5, Issue 4, April 2024 \n \nOkeke, Ibokette, Ijiga, Anebi, Ebiega, & Olumubo,  P.No. 1149-1172 Page 1157 \nPower Transformer Failure in Electricity Transmission Networks \nFailures of power transformers within electricity transmission networks pose substantial threats \nto the reliability and stability of the electrical grid. The repercussions of such failures encompass \npower outages, equipment impairment, and economic downtur ns. A comprehensive \ncomprehension of the root causes of these failures is imperative for the efficient operation and \nmaintenance of power transformers in transmission networks. Numerous factors contribute to \npower transformer failures in electricity transm ission networks, broadly classified into two \nmain categories: external and internal factors. External factors are related to the environment in \nwhich the transformer operates, while internal factors are related to the design, manufacturing, \nand maintenance of the transformer itself. \nExternal factors that can cause power transformer Failure \n1. Lightning and surge voltages:  Lightning strikes or other high -voltage surges can cause \nvoltage spikes in the transmission network, which can lead to insulation breakdown and \ntransformer failure. Surge arresters are installed to protect transformers from these high \nvoltages. \n2. Overloading: Power transformers are designed to handle a specific load capacity. If they are \nconsistently operated beyond their rated load capacity, the excessive heat generated can degrade \nthe insulation and cooling systems, leading to failure. Excessive loading of power transformers \ncan cause overheating, insulation breakdown, and winding failures. Overloading can occur due \nto system imbalances, voltage fluctuations, or improper planning and design of the network. \n3. Temperature variations: Extreme temperature variations, both hot and cold, can affect the \nperformance and lifespan of power transformers. High ambient temperatures can increase the \noperating temperature of the transformer, causing accelerated insulation ageing and reducing \nits lifespan. Conversely, extremely low temperatures can cause issues with the transformer's oil \nand cooling systems. \n4. Environmental factors:  Harsh environmental conditions, such as high temperatures, \nhumidity, corrosive gases, and salt -laden air, can accelerate the ageing and deterioration of \ntransformer components, leading to premature failures. \n5. Contamination: Pollution and contamination from dust, moisture, and chemical substances \ncan accumulate on the transformer's insulation, reducing its dielectric strength and thus \nincreasing the risk of failure. \nInternal factors that can cause power transformer failures include: \n1. Thermal Aging:  Transformers have a limited lifespan due to the ageing of insulation \nmaterials and other components. Over time, the insulation's dielectric strength and mechanical \nproperties degrade, making the transformer more prone to failure. Power transformers are \nsubjected to constant heating and cooling cycles due to normal load variations. Over time, these \ncycles can cause degradation of the insulation materials, resulting in reduced insulation strength \nand increased risk of failures. \n2. Poor design or manufacturing: Inadequate design or manufacturing processes can result in \ntransformers with inherent weaknesses or faults, such as improper core clamping, inadequate \ninsulation, or substandard materials. These issues can lead to premature failures. Poor \nworkmanship, sub standard materials, or design flaws during the manufacturing process can \nsignificantly increase the risk of transformer failures. These defects may not be immediately \nevident, and failures can occur after years of operation. \nEngineering Science & Technology Journal, Volume 5, Issue 4, April 2024 \n \nOkeke, Ibokette, Ijiga, Anebi, Ebiega, & Olumubo,  P.No. 1149-1172 Page 1158 \n3. Internal faults:  Electrical faults within the transformer, such as short circuits or winding \ninsulation breakdown, can cause localized heating, arcing, and thermal runaway, resulting in \nfailure.  \n4. Lack of maintenance: Inadequate or irregular maintenance of power transformers can lead \nto failures. Maintenance tasks such as oil analysis, inspection of cooling systems, and regular \ntesting can detect and prevent potential troubles before they escalate. \nRESEARCH METHODS AND MATERIALS. \nThis section centers on outlining the methods and techniques employed in conducting the study. \nThe various aspects related to the methods are discussed under the following sub -headings: \nResearch design, population of the study, sample and sampling techniqu e, nature and sources \nof data, validity and reliability of the instrument, method of data collection, method of data \nanalysis, ethical approval, and research methodology. \nResearch Design \nThe study employed a descriptive survey design, a research method aimed at collecting \ninformation about a population in an unbiased manner. Before implementing the survey, the \nresearcher conducted a pilot test of the questionnaire to ensure it is clear and  can effectively \ncollect the desired data. This involve administering the survey to a small group and refining the \nquestionnaire based on the feedback received. Overall, the process carried out in the descriptive \nsurvey design for this study involved careful planning, structured data collection, and rigorous \nanalysis to assess the view of respondents concerning reliability of power transformers in the \nNigerian transmission network in Rivers State. \nPopulation for the Study  \nThe population of this study comprised all the 725,372 consumers (households, firms and \nIndustries) of electricity supply in Rivers State (Source: Nigeria Electricity Report: Energy \nBilled, Revenue Generated and Customers, DISCOS, 2023). \nThe population of the study encompasses the complete set of individuals, cases, or entities that \nthe researcher aims to investigate or comprehend. It constitutes the specific group of interest \nfrom which a sample is selected to represent the broader entity. The researcher took meticulous \nsteps to clearly define the study's population, ensuring that the outcomes could be accurately \ngeneralized and applied. \nSample and Sampling Techniques \nThe study sampled 390 respondents using the Convenience Sampling Technique (CST). The \nsize of the sample pertains to the quantity of individuals or observations encompassed within a \nsample for a particular study or research endeavor. \nIn this study, the Convenience Sampling Technique (CST) was employed. Convenience \nsampling is a non-probability sampling method wherein participants are chosen based on their \nconvenient availability and accessibility to the researcher. The researcher selec ts on selected \nrespondents who were readily available, rather than randomly sampling from the entire \npopulation. \nNature/Sources of Data  \nData was collected from both the primary and secondary sources through, the use of \nQuestionnaire, Archival, and Structured Interview methods. The researcher used a \npredetermined set of questions to interviewed consumers of electricity in Rivers State.  \nEngineering Science & Technology Journal, Volume 5, Issue 4, April 2024 \n \nOkeke, Ibokette, Ijiga, Anebi, Ebiega, & Olumubo,  P.No. 1149-1172 Page 1159 \nThe researcher titled the questionnaire used for the study as Consumers Perception of Electricity \nPower Transformer Reliability (COPEPT) questionnaire. The questionnaire was crafted \nutilizing the Likert 5 -point rating scale, assigning values as follows: St rongly Agree (SA) \nrepresented 5 points, Agree (A) denoted 4 points, Undecided (U) was assigned 3 points, \nDisagree (D) equated to 2 points, and Strongly Disagree (SD) held a value of 1 point. The \nquestionnaire comprised two distinct sections, labeled Section A and Section B. Section A was \nformulated to extract demographic details from the respondents, while Section B was tailored \nto gather information pertaining to the problem under investigation. \nValidity/Reliability of Instrument  \nTo test the validity and reliability of the test instrument, the Structured Interview Questions and \nthe questionnaire were designed by the researcher and inputs were received from other sources \nto improve and validate the test instrument.  \nMethod of Data Collection  \nThe Direct Delivery Technique (DDT) was adopted to collect data from the respondents. The \nresearcher personally administered the questionnaires to the respondents and conduct the \ninterviews with electricity consumers.  \nMethod of Data Analysis  \nThe data was analyzed using the Weighted Mean Score (WMS). In this approach, the number \nof respondents for each question under investigation is multiplied by the scale rating and the \ntotal sum is divided by the number of respondents to arrive at a mean value which is judged as \naccepted or rejected based on the criterion mean value. \nEthical Approval  \nThe researcher adhered to ethical considerations throughout the study. Initially, a clearance \nletter of permission was acquired from the department to conduct the research. Subsequently, \nthe researcher obtained the voluntary consent of the participants to willingly engage and share \ninformation for the study. Furthermore, the researcher respected the respondents' right to \nprivacy and confidentiality concerning the information provided, safeguarding both personal \nidentities and the disclosed information. \nResearch Methodology \n1. Clearly define the objectives of the survey and the scope of assessment as well as the overall \ngoals of the reliability assessment. \n2. Determine the suitable sample size and selection method for the survey. In this case, the \nConvenience Sampling Technique (CST) was used. \n3. Develop a structured questionnaire to gather information relating to the reliability and \nperformance of power transformers. The questionnaire includes question on maintenance \npractices, historical performance, etc. \n4. Data Collection Process: Administer survey to the selected respondent which include network \noperators, maintenance personnel, etc. The responses were collected and compiled to form a \ndata set for analysis. \n5 Data Analysis Procedure: The data underwent an analysis to discern patterns, trends, and \npotential areas of concern associated with power transformer reliability in the transmission \nnetwork. This encompassed the statistical analysis of quantitative data. \n6. Initiate a Plan of Action (PoA) to address/prevent future failure occurrences and provide \nrecommendations for future research endeavors. \nEngineering Science & Technology Journal, Volume 5, Issue 4, April 2024 \n \nOkeke, Ibokette, Ijiga, Anebi, Ebiega, & Olumubo,  P.No. 1149-1172 Page 1160 \nRESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS \nThis chapter analyzed the results generated from the data.

Statement 1 states that Electricity Power supply in your area is consistent and uninterrupted. \nThe responses to the item indicated that 263 respondents with commutating rating scale of 263 \npoints strongly disagree with the opinion, 127 respondents with c ommutating rating scale of \n254 disagree to the opinion. The above quantitative assessment cumulated to mean of 1.3 for \nstatement 1. The mean of 1.3 is relatively lower than the criterion mean of 3.0 used for value \njudgment in this research work. Based on t he response from the respondents, it is concluded \nthat Electricity Power supply in the various areas is not consistent and uninterrupted. Thus, the \nstatement in item 1 which states that Electricity Power supply in your area is consistent and \nuninterrupted is rejected. \n2. Statement two states that the cost of electricity supply in your area is reasonable and within \nyour means. The distribution on the table shows that 379 respondents with commutating rating \nscale of 379 strongly disagree and 11 respondents with commutating rating scale of 22 disagree \nto the opinion. The above indications resulted to a mean of 1.0. Judging with the Likert 5 points \nrating scale, the above mean of 1.0 is less or lower than the criterion mean of 3.0 used for \njudgment in this study. The lower m ean of 1.0 is an indication that greater number of \nrespondents strongly disagree to the opinion in statement 2. Base on the above responses, the \nstatement in item 2 that the cost of electricity supply in your area is reasonable and within your \nmeans is rejected. \nEngineering Science & Technology Journal, Volume 5, Issue 4, April 2024 \n \nOkeke, Ibokette, Ijiga, Anebi, Ebiega, & Olumubo,  P.No. 1149-1172 Page 1166 \n3.The table reveals that the entire 390 respondents with commutating rating scale of 390 \nstrongly disagree to the opinion in statement 3 which states that the capacity of Power \nTransformer in your area is sufficient and adequate for the needs of the people.  The above \nresponses cumulated to a low mean of 1.0. Since the above mean of 1.0 is less than the criterion \nmean of 3.0, it is therefore rejected that the capacity of Power Transformer in your area is \nsufficient and adequate for the needs of the people. T his implies that the capacity of the \nelectricity power transformers in the various areas is not sufficient and adequate for the needs \nof the people. \n4. Statement 4 on the table reveals a mean of 5.0. This is an indication that the entire respondents \nstrongly agree to the opinion that there is always transparency and accountability in the meter \nreading and billing from the Electricity Power providers. Ba se on this response, item 4 is \naccepted. This implies that there is transparency and accountability in the meter reading and \nbilling from the Electricity Power providers in the areas under study. \n5. Statement 5 on the table regarding customer efficiency on issues resolutions and timeliness \nshowed 375 respondents disagreed with a commutating rating scale of 750 and 15 respondents \nstrongly disagreed with a rating scale of 15. The responses cumulated to a mean of 1.96 which \nis lower than 3.0, hence, the customer service delivery in terms of timeliness and efficiency of \nissues resolution is rejected. \n6. The statement on high level innovation and cutting -edge technology introduced to foster \nexpansion and future readiness is rejected as a mean of 2.92 was obtained which is lower than \nthe criterion mean. \nThe above findings support the work of Suraksha, (2020) who observed that for consumers to \nbe satisfied with the electricity supply in their domain, they expect a continuous and \nuninterrupted supply of electricity for their daily activities, both at home a nd in businesses at \naffordable cost for energy consumed with a strong conviction of future improvement, however, \nthis is not the case in this study.  \nCommon Factors Affecting the Reliability of Power Transformer in the Rivers \nTransmission Network Based on Customer Feedback. \nTable 3 shows the statistical presentation of the common factors affecting the reliability of \npower transformers in the Rivers State Transmission Network.  Seven (7) statements were \nraised to assess the opinions of the 390 respondents and the following findings were made: \n1. Statement 1 states that the age and overall condition of the power transformers have \nsignificant impacts on their reliabilities, the entire respondents demonstrated strong agreement \nto this statement just like they did to statement 6 that the impact of vandalism and theft on power \ntransformer accessories can bring about unreliability in electricity service delivery. The \nobtained mean values for the two different statements were 5.0 which is higher than the criterion \nmean, hence, both statements are accepted. \n2. Statements 2 and 3 produced individual mean values of 4.80 each which in either case is \nhigher than the criterion mean of 3.0, hence, the statements that power transformers may fail to \nfunction effectively when overloaded uncontrollably and harsh weather  conditions like heavy \nrain, lightning and extreme temperatures can cause transformer failures hold true. \n3. Statement 4 on inadequate maintenance as one of the major factors affecting the reliability \nof power transformers and electricity supply in Nigeria showed the entire respondents strongly \nopposing that view. With a low mean score of 1.0, the statement is rejected. \nEngineering Science & Technology Journal, Volume 5, Issue 4, April 2024 \n \nOkeke, Ibokette, Ijiga, Anebi, Ebiega, & Olumubo,  P.No. 1149-1172 Page 1167 \n4. The statements electrical and mechanical stresses such as power surges, vibrations affect \npower transformer reliability and poor investment in capacity building and training of Engineers \nand Technicians can affect power transformer operations showed mean values of 4.60 and 4.98 \nrespectively, which means they are accepted based on customer feedbacks. \nThe Impact of Unreliable Power Transformers on the Consumer Experience and Business \nOperations in the Rivers Transmission Network. \nThe results on the table reveal the opinions of respondents on the impact of unreliable power \ntransformers on the Consumer Experience and Business Operations in the Rivers State \nTransmission Network.  \n1. Statements 1 and 2 on the table show Mean of 5.0 for each of the statement respectively. The \nmean of 5.0 is higher than the criterion mean of 3.0 used in this study for judgment. The above \nmean of 5.0 for each of the items show that the entire respondent s strongly agree that when a \npower transformer fails, it can have significant adverse effects on the economy, resulting in \nfinancial and economic losses and transformer failures can lead to prolonged power outages, \nresulting in production halts and decreased productivity. \n2. Statements 3, 4 and 5 show mean values of 4.80, 4.90 and 4.77 respectively.

Here are several strategies that utilities \nand stakeholders can employ to enhance power reliability: \n1. Establish a Comprehensive Maintenance Program:  Implementing a comprehensive \nmaintenance program is vital to enhance the reliability of power transformers. This program \nshould include regular inspections, testing, and Proactive maintenance activities such as oil \nsampling and analysis, thermographic ima ging, and insulation resistance testing. Proper \nmaintenance ensures that potential issues are identified and addressed before they escalate to \nlarger problems. Establishing a comprehensive maintenance program for electricity power \ntransformers is crucial t o ensure their reliable and efficient operation, prolong their lifespan, \nand minimize the risk of failures and costly downtime (Olatunji, et.al., 2019). \n2. Load management: Ensuring that transformers are not overloaded and operated within their \nrated limits is essential to prevent overheating and insulation breakdown. Effective load \nforecasting, proper network planning, and real-time monitoring of load profiles can help in load \nmanagement \n3. Regular Inspections: Regular inspections are the foundation of any maintenance program \nfor power transformers. These inspections should be scheduled at specific intervals to identify \nearly signs of potential issues and make necessary repairs or replacements. Inspections shoul d \ninclude visual checks of external components, such as bushings, tap changers, fans, cooling \nsystems, and protective devices. \n4. Condition Monitoring:  Implementing condition monitoring techniques can improve the \nreliability of power transformers. Condition monitoring involves the use of advanced \ntechnologies, such as vibration analysis, infrared scanning, and partial discharge testing. These \ntechniques can detect abnormalities in the transformer's operation and provide valuable data for \nmaking maintenance decisions. \n5. Invest in Upgrading Aging Infrastructure:  The Nigerian power grid consists of aging \ninfrastructure, including transformers past their design life. Upgrading these transformers or \nEngineering Science & Technology Journal, Volume 5, Issue 4, April 2024 \n \nOkeke, Ibokette, Ijiga, Anebi, Ebiega, & Olumubo,  P.No. 1149-1172 Page 1169 \nreplacing them with newer, more efficient ones can significantly enhance reliability. Investing \nin modern transformer technologies that offer better insulation materials, cooling systems, and \nfault detection systems can contribute to improved reliability and reduced downtime (Ogurinde, \net.al, 2014l; Okunota, 2018). \n6. Enhance Transformer Design Practices: \nOptimizing transformer design practices can contribute to improved reliability. This includes \nadopting proper insulation, selecting appropriate cooling methods, and ensuring adequate fault \ndetection and protection mechanisms. Furthermore, implementing desi gn practices that \nconsider the harsh climate and environmental factors specific to Nigeria can help increase \ntransformer resilience and longevity (Adeitiba, 2018). \n7. Strengthen Training and Capacity Building : To ensure the efficient operation and \nmaintenance of power transformers, it is crucial to invest in training programs for engineers and \ntechnicians involved in transformer operations. Continuous professional development, capacity \nbuilding workshops, and certification programs can equip personnel with the necessary skills \nand knowledge to identify and address potential transformer issues promptly (Ali & Samuel, \n2018) \n8. Improved Security: To mitigate the issue of transformer vandalism, security measures such \nas installing surveillance cameras, fencing substations, and engaging local communities in the \nprotection of transformers should be implemented. Furthermore, stringent penalties and la w \nenforcement should be enforced to deter potential vandalism and theft activities.  \n9. Consumer Education:  Consumer education and awareness programs should be \nimplemented to improve consumer perspectives on transformer reliability. This can involve \nproviding regular updates to consumers on maintenance schedules, outage notifications, and \nresponding promptly to  consumer complaints. Building trust between electricity distribution \ncompanies and consumers help manage expectations and enhance consumer satisfaction with \nthe overall reliability of power transformers. \n10. Good Earthing System:  The earthing system in transformer installations plays a critical \nrole in ensuring both the safety and reliability of the electrical system by providing a low -\nresistance path for fault currents to flow to the ground, ensuring that in the event of a fault,  \nexcessive current is safely dissipated. This helps prevent electric shocks to personnel and \nminimizes the risk of electrical fires or equipment damage. \nCONCLUSIONS \nThe reliability of power transformers is of paramount importance in maintaining a stable and \nresilient electrical grid. Power transformers serve as critical components in the transmission of \nelectricity, facilitating the efficient delivery of power from ge neration sources to distribution \nnetworks to end -users. A reliable power transformer infrastructure ensures uninterrupted \nelectricity supply, supports economic activities, and enhances the quality of life for consumers. \nBy investing in modernization, proactive maintenance, and advanced monitoring technologies, \nutilities can mitigate the dominant causes of transformer failure, minimize downtime, and \nimprove overall reliability thereby leading improved satisfaction on the part of users of \nelectricity. In addition, strategies such as having a comprehensive maintenance schedule, proper \nload management, regular inspection, condition monitoring, upgrade of ageing transformer can \nenhance the resilience of the power system to withstand various challenges, including extreme \nEngineering Science & Technology Journal, Volume 5, Issue 4, April 2024 \n \nOkeke, Ibokette, Ijiga, Anebi, Ebiega, & Olumubo,  P.No. 1149-1172 Page 1170 \nweather events as well as electrical and mechanical stress thereby improving the reliability of \nthe power transformers. \n  \nReferences  \nAbodunrin, T.
