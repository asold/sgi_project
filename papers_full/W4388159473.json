  "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to show that the developed inductive current transformer may ensure the required wideband transformation accuracy and it may be applied, as the reference source, in the measuring system for the evaluation of the transformation accuracy of inductive current transformers for harmonics of distorted current. This device ensures 5 A and 1 A RMS secondary currents to provide the opportunity to use the differential measuring setup. Such solutions are characterized by the significantly reduced measurement uncertainty in relation to the comparative measurements made between two current/voltage channels. The problems required to ensure the high wideband transformation accuracy, including the self-generation phenomenon of the low order higher harmonics to the secondary current and a too-low frequency range of operation, were overcome in the design process. The values of its ratio error and the phase displacement of the developed reference wideband inductive current transformer did not exceed ±0.2%/° up to 1 kHz, ±0.4%/° from 1 kHz up to 1.5 kHz and ±0.5%/° from 1.5 kHz up to 3 kHz, as is required to perform the test procedure in accordance with the optional requirements for the inductive current transformers defined in the new edition of the standard IEC 61869-1.",
