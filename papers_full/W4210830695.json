They have contrib-\nuted substantially to the success of our species: our capacities for using, making and innovating tools\nhave opened up new ecological niches (and are still doing so) and contributed to the coevolution of\ncumulative culture, social learning and teaching (Henrich,2015; van Schaik et al.,1999). Today, the\nuse and making of many tools has become so complex and/or opaque that they rely on copying of\nsufficient fidelity, often over extended periods (Gurven et al., 2006; Kaplan & Robson, 2002).\nOwing to this special role of social learning for the acquisition of many forms of tool use, researchers\nhave investigated when, how and from whom humans, and especially children and adolescents, learn\n(Bjorklund & Gardiner, 2012; Esseily et al., 2016; Greif & Needham, 2011; Lancy, 2016, 2017;\nLew-Levy et al., 2017, 2020; Nagell et al., 1993; Nielsen et al., 2012; Somogyi et al., 2015). These\nsocially learned behaviours add to a phylogenetic baseline of tool use, i.e. a range of behaviours\nwhich members of the species in question can acquirewithout the need for copying– if they are at\nthe right environmental, developmental and motivational stage.

However, in contrast to much of human tool\nculture, there is little evidence that the behaviours of non-human great apes (henceforth apes) require\ncopying know-how (Bandini & Tennie,2020;B u s k e l l&T e n n i e ,accepted; Motes-Rodrigo & Tennie,\n2021; Reindl et al.,2018). Instead, they appear to besocially mediated reinnovations(Bandini & Tennie,\n2017): while non-copying types of social learning (e.g. local or stimulus enhancement) can guide the indi-\nvidual’s attention towards relevant materials and/or locations, each individual re-innovates the form of the\nbehaviour – the know-how– on their own from their ZLS. Owing to their limited engagement in form\ncopying, apes have been suggested to be restricted to ZLS-only cultures. If true, all behavioural forms\nobserved in wild apes are latent solutions (Reindl et al.,2018), and strong evidence for this was provided\nrecently (Motes-Rodrigo & Tennie,2021). Modern humans– through their capacity for copying know-\nhow – have managed to go beyond their ZLS, i.e. are able to learn and produce culture-dependent\nforms (i.e. forms which are too complex or arbitrary to be re-innovated from scratch).\nBy definition, cumulative culture does not arise from zero. The seemingly unbounded landscape of\ntools and technology modern humans have explored because of their cumulative cultural abilities rests\non a second landscape which can be explored by individual learning alone: the ZLS. This second‘base’\nlandscape is less well understood (Neldner et al.,2020; Reindl et al.,2016), but can give us important\ninsights – via cognitive cladistics– into the tool-using abilities of our ancestors before the emergence\nof cumulative culture (Tennie et al.,2016). One way to investigate this landscape is throughlatent solu-\ntion (or baseline) tests. These are experimental studies in which individuals naive to a cultural behav-\niour in question are provided with the raw materials necessary to produce the behaviour to study\nwhether they spontaneously re-innovate the behaviour (Bandini & Tennie, 2017; Tennie et al.,\n2009). While Luria and Vygotsky (1930) thought that all of children’s tool use stems from copying\nand teaching, with children’s spontaneous tool use being‘practically zero’ (p. 114), we now know\nthat infants from 18 months of age can spontaneously use a tool to obtain an out-of-reach object\n(Fagard et al.,2014; Rat-Fischer et al.,\n2012) and that from at least 3 years of age children have the\ncapacity to invent the correct solution to simple, but novel, stick tool-use problems on their own, with-\nout any immediate help from others (Neldner et al.,2020; Reindl et al.,2016). This might not be sur-\nprising, given that the ingredients for successful tool use– increasing motor skills, knowledge about\nobject affordances, refined perception–action routines, causal cognition– are built up gradually from\nearly infancy through social and asocial object exploration and play (Bjorklund & Gardiner,2012;\nChen et al.,2000; Greif & Needham,2011; Kahrs et al.,2013; Lockman, 2000; Somogyi et al.,2015).\nThe current study aimed to add to the exploration of the contents of the human ZLS (here by\nstudying a WEIRD (Westernized, Educated, Industrialised, Rich, Democratic) population (Henrich\net al., 2010), but cross-cultural work is to follow) by asking whether a more complex type of tool\nuse also lies within the human ZLS: namelyAssociative Tool Use(ATU) – the use of two or more\ntools in combination to achieve a goal (Shumaker et al.,2011). ATU is arguably cognitively more\ndemanding than ‘simple’ tool use (i.e. the use of a single tool; Boesch,2013): by definition, ATU\ninvolves a larger number of objects, and often consists of an increased temporal and/or spatial prob-\nlem–solution distance, resulting in an increase in the processing complexity of the task and subse-\nquently its cognitive load on working memory and other executive functions such as planning,\ninhibition, behavioural sequencing and decision making (Haidle,2010; Halford et al., 1998; Hunt\net al.,2013; Read,2008). Note, however, that the adjective‘associative’in ATU should only be under-\nstood in its literal meaning (‘relating to, connecting’, from Latinassociatus (= joined with)), used to\ndescribe a type of tool use in which two or more tools are used in combination. It should not be under-\nstood to imply a relationship to associative learning (nor any other learning mechanism). In the ter-\nminology by Shumaker et al. (2011), simple tool use refers to the use of a single tool, while ATU refers\nto the use of two or more tools in combination. The question of underlying learning mechanisms is a\nseparate one and not alluded to by using these terms. While simple tool use is assumed to be\n2 E. Reindl et al.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/ehs.2022.4 Published online by Cambridge University Press\ncognitively less demanding than ATU, this does not imply that simple tool use behaviours can always\nbe acquired by associative learning only.\nATU can be split into several categories, according to the different ways in which tools can be used\nin combination. To date, there is no uniform nomenclature to describe these different forms (compare\ne.g. Colbourne et al.,2021; Shumaker et al.,2011; Taylor et al.,2007; Wimpenny et al.,2009). We do\nnot aim to add to the potentially confusing terminology by introducing yet another set of definitions,\nand therefore refer to the nomenclature used by Shumaker et al. (2011)( Figure 1, Table 1), who have\nbecome a widely cited source in the field. We do acknowledge the potentially confusing use of the\nword ‘associative’, which many comparative psychologists are more familiar with in the context of\nassociative learning, but hope that the above has made clear that the two concepts are not related.\nWe focused on three out of the four ATU types by Shumaker et al. (2011; for definitions and exam-\nples seeTable 1): Tool set use, Sequential tool use, and a special case of using tool composites,Metatool\nuse. We did not include Secondary tool use as previous research had shown that tool making and innov-\nation per se are difficult for children (Beck et al.,2011; Nielsen et al.,2014; but see Voigt et al.,2019).\nATU has been reported in many species in which flexible (i.e. non-stereotyped) tool use has been\nobserved (for a review, see Table S1 in the OSF repository, which is based on Shumaker et al.,2011,\nbut also comprises research published since then). For example, Tool sets are used by wild chimpan-\nzees and capuchin monkeys: chimpanzees use sets of two or more sticks to get access to beehives, ter-\nmite mounds or ant nests– stout branches are used as pounding tools and levers to make and widen\nholes, and finer twigs are used on these holes as dipping sticks (Bernstein-Kurtycz et al., 2020;\nShumaker et al.,2011). Capuchin monkeys use stones to pound on beehives or next to cavities, and\nthen use sticks in these holes to probe for honey or small animals (Mannu & Ottoni, 2009).\nEvidence from latent solution tests with captive chimpanzees (Bernstein-Kurtycz et al.,2020), capu-\nchin monkeys (Westergaard et al.,1997) and Goffin’s cockatoos (O’Hara et al., 2021) shows that\nTool set use falls into the ZLS of these species.\nMetatool use is shown by wild chimpanzees in the context of nut-cracking: when stones are used as\nhammers and anvils, some individuals at Bossou (Republic of Guinea) use smaller stones as wedges to\nstabilise the anvils (Carvalho et al.,2008; Matsuzawa,1991). In addition, wild chimpanzees and captive\norangutans have been observed to use a stick to push a leaf/paper into a tree-hole or a puddle of liquid\nto retrieve water/juice more efficiently (Matsuzawa,1991, cited in Sugiyama,1997; Lehner et al.,2011;\nFigure 1.

Captive capuchin monkeys pounded chisel stones with hammer stones to break open\nlids, thus being more effective than when using the chisel stones alone (Westergaard et al.,1996;\nWestergaard & Suomi,1994a, b). Again, the studies on captive, target behaviour naive individuals sug-\ngest that Metatool use is within the ZLS of chimpanzees and capuchin monkeys, i.e. does not need to\nbe copied by others to be acquired.\nThere are no reports of Sequential tool use in wild non-human animals. Instead, Sequential tool use\nproblems have been created as novel laboratory tasks to investigate problem-solving and causal cog-\nnition in various species and date back to Köhler’s( 1921) work with chimpanzees. Research has\nshown that New Caledonian crows, all four species of great ape, capuchin monkeys and baboons\nare able to spontaneously and unaidedly solve Sequential tool use tasks, in which short sticks need\nto be used to retrieve longer sticks, which in turn can be used to access a reward (Anderson &\nHenneman, 1994; Bolwig, 1963; Martin-Ordas et al.,2012; Mulcahy et al.,2005; Taylor et al.,2007,\n2010; Wimpenny et al.,2009).\nIn contrast to the non-human animal literature, the low number of studies on ATU in humans is\nstriking. Köhler (1921) remarked that researchers were still facing terra incognita regarding under-\nstanding children’s flexible tool behaviors, and 90 years later, researchers still pointed out the only pat-\nchy understanding of the development of tool use in children (Greif & Needham,2011). While in the\nmeantime a number of studies on the origins and development of simple tool use, tool making and\ntool innovation in children have been conducted (Barrett et al.,2007; E. Bates et al.,1980; Bechtel\net al., 2013; S. R. Beck et al.,2016; Breyel & Pauen,2021; Brown, 1990; Chappell et al.,2013; Chen\net al., 2000; Deák, 2014; Gönül et al.,2018; Keen, 2010; Lew-Levy et al.,2021; McCarty et al.,1999,\n2001; Neldner et al., 2020; Pauen & Bechtel-Kuehne, 2016; Piaget, 1952; Rat-Fischer et al., 2012;\nRawlings et al.,2021; Reindl et al.,2016; Voigt et al.,2019; Willatts,1984), there are only few studies\non associative tool use in children, and all of them focus on only one type: Sequential tool use (Alpert,\n1928; Matheson, 1931; Metevier,\n2006). Köhler (1921) remarked that most tool-use behaviours in\nadults have become‘mechanised’, i.e. are carried out with ease and so questions about their ontogen-\netic and phylogenetic origins might not present themselves as very salient. Yet research on ATU allows\nus to (a) further illuminate the extent of the human ZLS, (b) improve our understanding of the evo-\nlution and development of tool-using and innovative skills and their underlying cognitive processes\n(using cognitive cladistics) and (c) provide insightful comparisons to the existing studies involving\nATU in non-humans.\nAlpert (1928) and Matheson (1931) adapted Köhler’s( 1921) tool-use tasks for use with preschool\nchildren. In their studies, children were separated from a reward by a railing set up in the testing room.\nTo obtain the reward, children had to use a stick lying on their side of the railing to rake in a longer\nout-of-reach stick beyond the railing, which they could then use to fetch the reward. Children below\n2.5 years of age did not solve this task; only 10 out of the 28 tested 2.5- to 4.5-year-olds (36%) spon-\ntaneously solved it (Matheson,1931). In a more recent study, 3-year-olds completed two tasks involv-\ning the use of a single tool before attempting an ATU task (Metevier,2006): In the ‘tube task’,\nparticipants had to use a stick to push a toy out of a tube. In the‘rake task’, they had to use a rake\nto obtain an out-of-reach toy on the table. Children found these tasks rather easy, indicated by success\nrates above 75%. In the‘combination task’ (ATU), children first had to use the rake to obtain an\nout-of-reach stick on the table, and subsequently use this stick to push a toy out of the tube.\nSuccess rates were low (25–37%), indicating that 3-year-olds struggled with Sequential tool use\neven though they readily solved the individual components beforehand. These studies suggest that\nSequential tool use is challenging for children up to at least the age of 4 years, both when having\nto solve such tasks spontaneously and given previous experience with individual elements of the\ntasks. However, no research seems to have been carried out yet on Metatool and Tool set use abilities\nin children.\nThe current study aimed to investigate whether young children would be able to solve three types of\nATU tasks (Tool set use, Sequential tool use and Metatool use) on their own in a latent solution test,\ni.e. without immediate social learning (Experiment 1). In Experiment 2 we further compared the\nEvolutionary Human Sciences 5\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/ehs.2022.4 Published online by Cambridge University Press\ndifficulty of Tool set and Sequential Tool use using apparatuses that were more comparable between\nthese ATU types. The age range of our samples was slightly higher than in a previous latent solution\ntest on simple tool use (Reindl et al.,2016) as it was assumed that ATU would pose greater demands\non executive functions, such as working memory, which are still developing during childhood (Garon\net al.,2008). However, note that increasing the age range also increases the amount of previous cultural\nknowledge that children bring to the experiment and thus the probability that successful children can\nuse previously acquired cultural knowledge to solve the tasks.\nExperiment 1\nWe investigated whether 3.5- to 4-year-old children would be able to spontaneously solve three types\nof ATU tasks: Tool set use, Metatool use and Sequential tool use. We created six tasks (two tasks per\nATU type); four were based on ATU behaviours observed in wild or captive animals (one Tool set use\ntask, both Metatool use tasks, one Sequential tool use task; see below) and two were new creations.\nEach child was administered three tasks in a single session, with one task from each ATU category\n(task order counterbalanced). During data collection, we noticed that one of our Metatool use tasks\n(Anvil prop) had a design flaw as most children (eventually 71%) were able to solve the task in a\nway not intended by the task design, i.e., without ATU. This task is described in the\nSupplementary Material but is not included in the analysis.\nMethods\nParticipants\nWe tested 66 children (31 boys) between 3 years 6 months and 4 years 9 months (dates of birth were\nknown for 64 children: mean ± SD, 4 years 1 month ± 3.88 months) in seven nurseries and a Science\nmuseum in Birmingham, UK, between March and July 2014. Noa priorisample size calculation was\ncarried out for either Experiment 1 or 2; instead, the goal was to test as many children as possible\nduring the time window available for this project. The ethnic composition of the sample was 65.2%\nWhite, 21.2% Black and 13.6% Asian. Participants were recruited through letters sent to parents\n(for children tested in nurseries) and via advertisements on the museum website and social media\n(for children tested at the museum). Ethical approval for both experiments was granted by the\nUniversity of Birmingham, UK, STEM Ethical Review Committee.\nMaterials\nDrawings of the tasks are displayed inFigure 2(for photos of the tasks, see Figure S1). For space rea-\nsons, tasks are only briefly described here; a full description including animations on how each task\ncould be solved can be found in the Supplementary Material. For each task, the apparatus(es) were\npositioned in front of the child and all freely accessible tools were placed between the task and the\nchild. Rewards were either stickers placed in containers or other target objects which could be\nexchanged for a sticker after completion of the task.\nTool set use– Open and probe. This task was based on the use of Tool sets by chimpanzees to open\nbeehives, ant nests or termite mounds (see above). The goal was to insert a short, sturdy stick into\na tube and pierce a tin foil barrier, and then to use a long pipecleaner with hook and loop fastener\nwrapped around both ends to reach through the hole in the barrier and retrieve a target object\nfrom the back end of the tube.\nTool set use– Push and hook.This task was novel. The goal was to insert a short, sturdy stick into the\nside or top openings of a T-shaped apparatus to move a barrier inside the apparatus, and then to insert\na rope with a hook at its end through the top of the apparatus to fish for a bucket containing a reward\n(this second step was similar to the hook task in Chappell et al.,2013).\n6 E. Reindl et al.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/ehs.2022.4 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nFigure 2.

Figure drawn by Nuria Melisa Morales\nGarcía.\nEvolutionary Human Sciences 7\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/ehs.2022.4 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nMetatool use– Sponge push–pull. This task was based on observations of chimpanzees and orangutans\nusing a stick (metatool) to push a leaf/paper towel into a tree-hole or puddle of liquid to retrieve water/\njuice more efficiently (Matsuzawa,1991, cited in Sugiyama,1997; Lehner et al.,2011; Lethmate,1982).\nChildren were presented with a transparent tube filled with 500 ml of water and a smaller container\nplaced next to it. The goal was to fill the small container with water. Available tools were a wooden\nstick and a ball of cotton wool. While the stick could be used on its own to solve the task– by dipping\nit into the tube repeatedly to extract water, this method was inefficient. Instead, the stick use could be\nimproved by the wool as a metatool: children could first drop the wool into the tube so that it could\nabsorb water, after which they could use the stick to retrieve the wool. Note that because of this\nretrieval action (stick used to retrieve wool from the bottle), the Sponge push–pull task might resemble\na Sequential tool use task, which by definition involves the use of a tool to retrieve another tool.\nHowever, the retrieval action is just a feature of this particular task. In Metatool use, a tool (here\nthe stick) is used to carry out a target action (here to retrieve the water from the bottle) and the meta-\ntool (here the wool) enhances the efficiency of the target action. In contrast, the defining feature of\nSequential tool use is that a tool is used to retrieve a second tool in a first step, and then this second\ntool can be used in a second step to carry out the target action. More information about this differ-\nentiation can be found in the Supplementary Material.\nSequential tool use– Stick stick. This task was based on an apparatus used for studying Sequential tool\nuse in New Caledonian crows (seefigure 1in Taylor et al.,2007). The goal was to insert a short stick\ninto a box to rake in a longer stick, which could then be used on another box to obtain an-out-of-reach\nsticker.\nSequential tool use– Stick stone. At the time we designed this experiment, this task was novel. Note,\nhowever, that a similar design has subsequently been used with New Caledonian crows (Gruber et al.,\n2019). Metevier (2006) remarked that in most Sequential tool use studies the tools were of the same\ntype (usually sticks of different sizes) and used in a similar fashion (e.g. raking). Therefore, we created\na task in which two different kinds of tools (a stick and a stone) had to be used in different ways\n(pushing, dropping). The goal was to insert a short stick into an apparatus to push out a small\nstone. The stone could then be dropped into the top of a second apparatus where it would activate\na trapdoor and release a target object.\nDesign and procedure\nFor reasons of practicability, we tested children only once and thus only administered a subset of the\ntasks (a warm-up game and three tasks) to each child. The combination and order of the tasks were\ncounterbalanced. Across children, every task was presented 24 times, occurring eight times in each of\nthe three positions. Participants were tested individually by the same female experimenter (E.R.) and\nwere sitting at a table or on the floor, perpendicular to the experimenter. A warm-up game was used to\nfamiliarise children with breaking and modifying material within the experimental session. This was\nimportant as the Anvil prop task required children to apply physical force and break the plastic nut.\nFor the test phase, children were presented with three semi-randomly chosen tasks, one from each\nATU category. Tasks were presented as a game to the children in which they could win stickers.\nMaterials were placed in front of the participant, with the tools lying between the apparatus(es)\nand the child. Children were told the goal of the task, e.g.‘to get this orange ball out of the bottle’\n(Open and probe) and that they could‘use anything here on the table/floor’ to solve the task, but\nthey were never told that they had to use the tools to solve the tasks and they only received general\nencouragement. Children had 3 min to solve each game. Trials ended when children obtained the tar-\nget, when time was over or if children refused to play. When one trial ended, the experimenter cleared\nthe table/floor and fetched the next task. Children were rewarded with stickers regardless of success.\nChildren were never shown the correct solution of a task if they were unsuccessful. Total testing time\nwas ∼15 min.\n8 E. Reindl et al.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/ehs.2022.4 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nScoring and analysis\nChildren’s behaviour was live-coded and coding was double-checked offline by E.R. using videos from\nnine children (14% of the sample; note that videos were not available for all participants). For each\ntask, we scored whether children picked up the tool(s), used the tool(s) in the manner intended by\nthe experimenter, engaged in ATU (i.e. whether children used both tools to solve the task in a manner\nthat was intended by us) and whether they solved the task following ATU (Correct success; i.e. whether\nchildren succeeded after having used both tools in the way intended by us). We scoredIncorrect success\nwhenever children solved the task in a way that was not intended by us. To obtain inter-observer reli-\nability, 31% of the valid trials (i.e. 50 trials) were live-coded by a second rater who was present during\nthe experiment and asked to code our two main variables, ATU and Correct success. Inter-rater agree-\nment for both variables was perfect (Cohen’s k = 1.000).\nEach of the 66 children participated in three tasks, resulting in 198 trials. From these, we excluded\nall of the Anvil prop trials (n = 33) and a further three trials owing to experimenter error (Tube task,\nn = 2) or because the child became upset (Tube task,n = 1), resulting in a final number of 162 valid\ntrials across five tasks.\nAnalyses were carried out in R version 4.0.3 (R Core Team,2020). To address our main question–\nwhether children were able to spontaneously engage in ATU to solve novel problems– we carried out\ndescriptive analyses for each task, investigating success rates. In exploratory analyses, we examined\nwhether the two tasks within the Tool set and Sequential tool use types were of comparable difficulty\nby conducting chi-square analyses of children’s rates of ATU and Correct success. We also examined\nwhether ATU type affected children’s ATU and Correct success using two Generalised Linear Mixed\nModels (GLMMs; Baayen,2008) with binomial error structure and logit link function (McCullagh &\nNelder, 1989) implemented by theglmer function of the R packagelme4 (D. M. Bates et al.,2013). In\nboth models, age in months (z-transformed to a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1) was\nentered as control variable and ATU type as the predictor variable. Participant ID was included as\na random effect to account for the fact that each child contributed several datapoints. Model stability\nwas assessed by comparing the estimates obtained from the model based on all data with those\nobtained from models with the levels of the random effects excluded one at a time (Nieuwenhuis\net al., 2012). There were no issues with model stability (Tables S7 and S8). As an overall test of the\neffect of ATU type we compared each full model with a null model lacking the test predictor but keep-\ning age and the same random effects structure as the full model (Forstmeier & Schielzeth,2011) using\na likelihood ratio test (Dobson,2002). The data and script for Experiments 1 and 2 can be found on\nthe OSF website:https://osf.io/d3pz5/?view_only=ba368e675f324a56a7cad600d6c39581.\nResults\nTable 2 provides an overview of the ATU and Success scores of the tasks. For a detailed\nbreakdown of how children attempted to solve the tasks and at which points in the process children\ngot ‘stuck’, see the Supplementary Material. For each task, two or more children were able to spontan-\neously, i.e. unaidedly and within a very short time span of 3 min, engage in ATU and solve the task.\nThe double-case ZLS standard requires that for relatively less complex behaviours, which have some\n(low) probability of occurring by chance, two independent, naive individuals must demonstrate the\nbehaviour. According to this standard, this allows ZLS researchers to be confident enough to\nconclude that the behaviour was re-innovated from the species’ ZLS, rather than being a chance\noccurrence (Bandini & Tennie,2017; see also Supplementary Material for more details). This is the\ncase here. In addition, the materials and problems in our tasks were rather unfamiliar to the partici-\npants. Together, these results support the view that simple ATU behaviours as presented here are\nwithin the human ZLS and do not rely on social learning to be acquired.\nWe examined whether the two tasks within the Tool set use type were of comparable difficulty.\nWe found that the Open and Probe task had higher rates of ATU than the Tube task (χ\n2(1) = 9.98,\np = 0.001) as well as higher Correct success rates (χ2(1) = 12.10,p < 0.001), indicating that the Tool\nEvolutionary Human Sciences 9\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/ehs.2022.4 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTable 2.

Reindl et al.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/ehs.2022.4 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nset use tasks were not of equal difficulty. We also compared the two tasks within the Sequential tool\nuse type and found them to be of equal difficulty regarding the ATU and Correct success rates\n(Fisher’s exact tests, bothp = 1.000). As we noticed during data collection that there was a design\nflaw with the Anvil prop task (the majority of children solved the task in a way not intended by us\nand not involving ATU), we excluded Anvil prop from all analyses. Therefore, Metatool use was\nnot included in this analysis.\nWe examined whether ATU type affected children’s ATU and Correct success rates. The models\ncomprised 144 trials from 63 children (cases of Incorrect success were removed from the analysis).\nATU type had a significant positive effect on ATU rates (χ\n2(2) = 30.70,p < 0.001). Specifically, Tool\nset use yielded significantly higher ATU rates than Sequential tool use (p < 0.001) and Metatool use\n(p = 0.030; note that Metatool use only consisted of the Sponge push–pull task). The odds for children\nin the Tool set use condition engaging in ATU over the odds of children in the Sequential tool use\ncondition were 15.01 (95% CI [6.16; 100.38]). The odds for children in the Tool set use condition scor-\ning ATU over the odds of children in the Metatool use condition were 4.05 (95% CI [1.57; 14.79]).\nPerformance in the Sequential tool use and Metatool use tasks was equally low (p = .135; Table S7).\nATU type also had a significant positive effect on Correct success rates (χ\n2(2) = 15.08,p< 0.001).\nSpecifically, Tool set use yielded significantly higher Correct success rates than Sequential tool use\n(p = 0.003). The odds for children in the Tool set use condition scoring Correct success over the\nodds of children in the Sequential tool use condition were 8.98 (95% CI [2.86; 35667.67]– but\nnote the large uncertainty). No other comparisons were statistically significant (Table S8).\nDiscussion\nExperiment 1 investigated whether 3.5- to 4-year-old children were able to independently re-innovate\nhow to use two tools in different combinations to solve several problem-solving tasks. To our knowl-\nedge, this is the first time several ATU types have been investigated in children in a single study. We\nfound that children succeeded in all three tested types of ATU individually, without the need for social\nlearning immediate to the experimental context (note that past social learning could still matter).\nHowever, success rates were low, with only one task (Open and probe (Tool set use)) having a success\nrate of more than 50%, suggesting that the individual invention of these behaviours is– while not\nimpossible – quite challenging for 3- to 4-year-old children. Sequential tool use was especially chal-\nlenging (∼6% Correct success rate). This might be due the fact that the Sequential tool use tasks\ninvolved two apparatuses, which might have increased general task difficulty compared with the\nother ATU types. However, despite this, our tasks were still relatively easy versions of Sequential\ntool use: we presented only one initial tool (rather than a choice of tools), with which only one\nother tool could be retrieved. The cost of retrieving the second tool was relatively small and the\ntwo apparatuses were in proximity (in contrast, in some studies involving New Caledonian crows,\napparatuses are positioned opposite each other (Wimpenny et al.,2009) or completely out of the\nsight of the others (Gruber et al.,2019) so that subjects have to keep the necessary information in\ntheir short-term memory, providing strong evidence of New Caledonian crows mentally representing\nstages of the problem). The different types of ATU were not equally easy, with Tool set use being the\neasiest type of ATU, and Sequential tool use possibly the hardest. This could be interpreted as a first\nhint at a potential‘cognition-based hierarchical organization’(Shumaker et al.,2011, p. 21) of ATU.\nYet, our results should be treated with caution until future research has been carried out.\nExperiment 2 followed up on the question whether Sequential tool use actually posed more cogni-\ntive demands than Tool set use tasks or whether the finding from Experiment 1 was caused by task-\nspecific effects. In Experiment 2, we used thesame apparatus to investigate children’s spontaneous\nengagement in Tool set and Sequential tool use behaviours, removing the confound of task-specific\ninfluences on performance. To also investigate potential age effects on performance, we tested a\nslightly wider age range (3–6 years). Experiment 2 also involved a condition requiring Multifunctional\ntool use (i.e. using a single tool in different functions) to contrast against Tool set and Sequential tool use.\nEvolutionary Human Sciences 11\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/ehs.2022.4 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nExperiment 2\nWe used two apparatuses (box apparatusand tube apparatus; Figure 3), which could be presented in two\nATU types (Tool set use, Sequential tool use). Presenting the ATU versions on two apparatuses and\ncomparing children’s performance across them was a first step towards disentangling effects based on\nthe cognitive demands of the respective ATU type from more task-specific demands (e.g. differences\nin transparency of the apparatuses, or how easily alternative solutions could be found). A third presen-\ntation mode was Multifunctional tool use (described below, but not a major focus of this paper).\nChildren were randomly assigned to one of these three tool-use types (Tool set use, Sequential tool\nuse, Multifunctional tool use). Participants completed two trials within their tool-use type, one with\nthe box and one with the tube apparatus (order counterbalanced).\nMethods\nParticipants\nThe final sample included 119 children (53 boys) between 3 years 0 months and 6 years 10 months\n(Mean ± sd: 5 years 0 month ± 12.38 months) tested in nurseries, schools and a Science Museum in\nBirmingham, UK (n = 95) and a nursery in Jena, Germany (n = 24) between January and March\n2015. The ethnic background of the sample was mainly White (n = 109; 91%), nine children (7%)\nwere Black, and one (2%) was Asian. Three additional children were tested but removed from the sam-\nple because they were below the age of 3 (n = 2) or because of interference from nursery staff (n = 1).\nMaterial\nWe used two apparatuses which could be administered in each of the three tool-use versions (Tool set,\nSequential, Multifunctional tool use; Figures 3 and S7). For space reasons, tasks are only briefly\ndescribed here; a full description including animations can be found in the Supplementary Material.\nBox apparatus– Tool set use.This task was similar to the Open and Probe task of Experiment 1. The\ngoal was to insert a short, sturdy stick into the box to make a hole in a tin foil barrier and to then use a\npipecleaner to reach through the hole to retrieve a reward.\nBox apparatus– Sequential tool use.In this version, there was no barrier inside the box. The tools were\nthe same as in Tool set use (short stick, pipecleaner). The pipecleaner was placed inside the box at the\nplace where the barrier was positioned in Tool set use. The task required using the stick to retrieve the\npipecleaner from the box, followed by using the pipecleaner to retrieve the container with the reward.\nBox apparatus– Multifunctional tool use.As in Tool set use, the interior of the box was divided by a tin\nfoil barrier. However, only one tool was available, combining the functions of the tools in the Tool set\nuse version: a wooden stick covered with hook and loop fastener at both ends, which could both pierce\nthe tin foil barrier and reach and retrieve the container.\nTube apparatus– Tool set use. The task was similar to the Push and hook task of Experiment 1. The\ngoal was to insert a stick into the apparatus to remove a cloth barrier by pushing or pulling it via the\ntop or side openings, followed by inserting a rope into the top to hook a bucket with a sticker.\nTube apparatus– Sequential tool use.The tools were the same as in Tool set use, but there was no cloth\nbarrier inside the apparatus. The rope was placed inside the box, close to the side facing the partici-\npant. The task required using the stick to retrieve the rope via the side openings, after which the rope\ncould be inserted into the top to hook the bucket.\n12 E. Reindl et al.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/ehs.2022.4 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nFigure 3. Materials used in Experiment 2. Figure drawn by Nuria Melisa Morales García.\nEvolutionary Human Sciences 13\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/ehs.2022.4 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTube apparatus– Multifunctional tool. The setup was as in Tool set use, but there was only one tool\navailable combining the functions of the two tools in Tool set use: a plastic stick with two hooks facing\nin opposite directions which could both remove the barrier and hook the bucket.\nDesign and procedure\nThe procedure was similar to Experiment 1, with the difference that here participants were given 4 min\nto solve the task (for a full description of the procedure, see Supplementary Material).\nScoring and analysis\nChildren’s behavior was live-coded. We recorded whether the tool(s) associated with each task were\npicked up and used in the manner intended by the experimenter. For Sequential tool use and Tool\nset use we again scored ATU and Correct success. In the Multifunctional tool use task, we scored\nwhether the tool was used in both its intended functions (equivalent to ATU) and Correct success.\nWe also scored instances of Incorrect success for all tasks. To obtain inter-observer reliability, 84%\nof the valid trials were coded by a second rater (68% of these trials were coded live, the rest from\nvideo). Interrater agreement for Correct success was very good (Cohen’s k = 0.988).\nAll 119 children participated in two tasks, resulting in 238 trials. Three trials had to be removed\nfrom the analysis: in the Tool set use version of the Tube task, one trial had to be excluded as the\ncloth did not fully cover the hole and another trial had to be excluded because the child cried. In\nthe Sequential tool use version of the Box task, one trial had to be excluded because the child tipped\nthe box. We first carried out descriptive analyses. Then we examined whether the two versions within\neach tool use type were of comparable difficulty regarding ATU and Correct success by conducting\nMcNemar tests (with continuity correction). To investigate the effects of condition and age on\nATU and Correct success, we ran two GLMMs with binomial error structure and logit link function.\nAge in months (z-transformed) and condition were entered as predictor variables, and participant ID\nwas included as a random effect.\nResults\nTable 2provides an overview of the ATU and Success scores of the tasks (Table S9 provides the same\noverview split by age groups). Out of the 116 participants who completed two valid trials, 60 children\n(52%) were unsuccessful in both tasks, 44 children (38%) had one of the tasks correct and only 12\nchildren (10%) were able to succeed in both tasks, suggesting that the tasks were challenging for\nthe children. Despite the low success rates, especially in the youngest age group (Table S9), children\nas young as 3 years of age were able to independently re-innovate Tool set and Sequential tool use. The\nlow success rates could not be explained by a lack of motivation as children were generally found to be\ninterested in the tasks and interact with the tools: In each condition, at least 82% of the children picked\na tool up (see Tables S10–S15). A more detailed overview of how children attempted to solve the tasks\ncan be found in the Supplementary Material.\nIn the Tool set use condition, there was no significant difference between the box and tube versions\nfor either ATU (p = 0.579) or Correct success (p = 0.505). Both versions were very challenging, partly\nowing to task-specific reasons that are not necessarily tied to the ATU nature of the tasks: in the box\nversion, while most children correctly inserted the stick into the box, many did not pierce the tin foil\nbarrier – either because they tried to reach the reward by pushing the stick over the barrier or because\nthey failed to pierce the foil despite trying (Figure S6). Note that this difficulty in piercing the tin foil\ndid not occur in the Open and probe task of Experiment 1. This was possibly because (a) it was not\npossible to bypass the tin foil barrier in the Open and probe task and (b) in Experiment 2 we used a\nlarger piece of tin foil, which might have resulted in the foil being held in the cardboard frame more\nloosely, making it harder to break it. Similarly, in the tube version, many children accidentally dropped\nthe stick into the tube or failed to remove the cloth barrier despite trying (Figure S7). If these design\n14 E. Reindl et al.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/ehs.2022.4 Published online by Cambridge University Press\naspects made the successful use of the first tool of the tool set (i.e. the stick) difficult, it means that\nExperiment 2 could potentially underreport children’s ATU capacities in a Tool set use context.\nIn the Sequential tool use condition, the box version yielded significantly higher rates of ATU\n( p = 0.027) and Correct success (p = 0.016) than the tube version. This was possibly because many\nchildren did not notice the rope inside the tube apparatus and/or accidentally dropped the stick\ninto the tube, which posed additional challenges to the tube version (see the Supplementary\nMaterial for a longer discussion).\nIn the Multifunctional tool use condition, the tube version revealed significantly higher rates of‘ATU’\n(i.e. using the tool correctly in both functions) and Correct success than the box version (bothp <0 . 0 0 1 ) .\nIn the box version, the challenges were similar to the box version of the Tool set use condition: many\nchildren either failed to break the tin foil barrier despite attempting and/or tried to reach the reward by\npushing the tool over the barrier. The tube version, however, was easier in the Multifunctional tool use\ncondition as it was not possible to drop and lose the tool in the tube (owing to its length) and because it\nseemed to be easier to remove the cloth barrier. In sum, the challenges the children faced were not only\ndetermined by the tool use condition, but also in large part by task-specific aspects.\nThe GLMMs consisted of 235 observations from 119 children. Regarding the model with ATU as a\ndependent variable, age and condition together explained the data significantly better than a null\nmodel only consisting of the intercept (χ\n2(3) = 47.14,p< 0.001). Condition had a significant positive\neffect on ATU rates (χ2(2) = 33.98,p< 0.001; Table S16). While Tool set and Sequential tool use did\nnot differ in their ATU rates ( p = 0.998), they were both significantly more difficult than\nMultifunctional tool use (bothp < 0.001). The odds for children in the Tool set use condition scoring\nATU over the odds of children in the Multifunctional tool use were 0.16 (95% CI [0.06; 0.32]), i.e. the\nodds of scoring ATU in the Tool set use condition were decreased by 84% compared with the\nMultifunctional tool use condition. The odds for children in the Sequential tool use condition scoring\nATU over the odds of children in the Multifunctional tool use were also 0.16 (95% CI [0.05; 0.34]), i.e.\nalso decreased by 84%. Age had a significant, positive effect on ATU rates (χ\n2(1) = 14.68,p< 0.001).\nWith each month increase, there was an increase in the odds of scoring ATU of 1.85 (95% CI [1.37; 2.77]).\nThis pattern of results was similar when using Correct success as dependent variable. Age and con-\ndition together explained the data significantly better than a null model only consisting of the intercept\n(χ\n2(3) = 55.51,p< 0.001). Condition had a significant positive effect on Correct success rates (χ2(2) =\n37.52, p< 0.001; Table S17). As with ATU, the Correct success rates in the Tool set and Sequential tool\nuse conditions did not differ (p = 0.635) but were significantly lower than in Multifunctional tool use\n(both p < 0.001). The odds for children in the Tool set use condition scoring Correct success over the\nodds of children in the Multifunctional tool use were 0.11 (95% CI [0.03; 0.23]), i.e. the odds of scoring\nCorrect success in the Tool set use condition were decreased by 89% compared with the\nMultifunctional tool use condition. The odds for children in the Sequential tool use condition scoring\nCorrect success over the odds of children in the Multifunctional tool use were 0.17 (95% CI [0.06;\n0.33]), i.e. they were decreased by 87%. Age had a significant, positive effect on Correct success\nrates (χ\n2(1) = 21.11,p< 0.001). With each month increase, there was an increase in the odds of scoring\nCorrect success of 2.20 (95% CI [1.58; 3.51]).\nDiscussion\nExperiment 2 investigated children’s performance in Tool set and Sequential tool use tasks and com-\npared it with their performance in Multifunctional tool use tasks. In contrast to Experiment 1, in\nwhich the tasks of different ATU types differed in both ATU type and in the apparatus and task\ndesign, in Experiment 2 the different conditions were more comparable as they were administered\nusing the same kinds of apparatuses (a box and a tube apparatus, each of which could be presented\nin each of the three tool use versions).\nSupporting the findings from Experiment 1, the results showed that children from 3 years of age\nwere able to independently invent how to use two tools in different combinations to solve these\nEvolutionary Human Sciences 15\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/ehs.2022.4 Published online by Cambridge University Press\ntasks, even when given no familiarisation phase, only 4 min per task and no opportunity for social\nlearning. Despite this, the results again showed that spontaneously re-innovating ATU in novel tasks\nis difficult for preschoolers, at least under testing situations as used here. We found no evidence that\nTool set and Sequential tool use differed in difficulty. However, both tasks were significantly more difficult\nthan the Multifunctional tool use tasks, i.e. tasks which had the same setup as the Tool set use versions\nbut differed in the number of tools provided (a single tool that could be used in two modes). Success rates\nincreased with age over the tested range from 3 to 6 years. A more fine-grained analysis of solution\napproaches showed that performance was not only affected by the specific tool-use demands of a task\n(i.e. whether Sequential tool use or the use of a Tool set was required), but also to a large part by the\nidiosyncratic features of each task, despite the use of the same apparatus across ATU versions.\nGeneral discussion\nThe aim of the current study was to address the gap in the developmental literature on the emergence\nand spontaneous invention of ATU behaviours in human children. This study investigated children’s\nperformance in tasks involving Sequential tool use (using a tool to get a tool), Metatool use (using one\ntool to improve a second tool) and Tool set use (using two tools to achieve a single outcome) and\nshowed in two experiments that children from 3 years of age can spontaneously invent solutions to\nall three of these ATU types individually, i.e. without the need for immediate social learning. These find-\nings suggest that ATU behaviours lie within the human ZLS, as they have also been shown to do for all\nspecies of great apes and some other non-human primate and bird species (Table 1and Table S1 in the\nOSF repository). The presence of spontaneous ATU in humans and non-human great apes suggests that\nthe last common ancestor of humans and apes, living∼13 million years ago (Stewart & Disotell,1998),\nwas probably also able to engage in ATU without the need for copying know-how.\nWe minimised the possibility that children could draw on directly relevant cultural knowledge by\nusing novel tasks that children were unlikely to have encountered before. This does not mean that chil-\ndren did not draw on more general knowledge, e.g. about affordances and the physical properties of\nthe materials involved (e.g. ropes, hooks, pipecleaners). Assuming that the novelty of the tasks and the\nparticipants’relatively young age were effective in minimising children’s ability to use specific cultural\nknowledge, the results suggest that all of the tested ATU types potentially lie within the human ZLS,\ni.e. at least some types of ATU can be invented without social learning.\nOur experiments still need to be replicated in other, non-Westernised cultures to allow for a stron-\nger conclusion about the human ZLS. In addition, future studies could attempt to test even younger\nchildren. The age range tested in the current study was slightly higher than what was used in a pre-\nvious study on simple tool use (Reindl et al.,2016) as it was assumed that ATU would demand greater\nexecutive function skills (especially working memory), which are still developing in children (Garon\net al., 2008; Reindl et al.,2021).\nAcross both experiments, success rates were low, supporting previous findings that ATU is challeng-\ning for preschoolers (Alpert,1928; Matheson,1931; Metevier, 2006). Experiment 2 showed that chil-\ndren’s performance still increased with age. Our tasks were purposefully created to be challenging.\nChildren were given only a short time to explore and attempt the tasks, which might have decreased\nthe ecological validity of the task and artificially limited children’s tool-using skills. In recent years\nevidence has accumulated that longer testing times will result in higher success rates in children\n(Breyel & Pauen, 2021; Voigt et al., 2019). Thus, it is possible that when administering our tasks\nwith a longer time window, more children will find solutions. To increase the ecological validity of\nsuch studies, future projects should provide longer testing times and more possible solutions, and\narguably also administer tasks to pairs of participants instead to individuals only (see Gönül,\nHohenberger, Corballis, & Henderson,2019; Reindl & Wronski,2022).\nHow do children’s low success rates compare with the success rates reported so far for non-human\nanimals? Based on the data available to us (Table S1 in the OSF repository), we calculated the percent-\nage of successful participants for all previous ATU experiments for which both the number of tested\n16 E. Reindl et al.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/ehs.2022.4 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nindividuals and the number of successful individuals were reported (note that we did not include stud-\nies listed in the‘questionable cases’sheet, e.g. those in which individuals received training or had con-\nsiderable prior experience with parts of the task), resulting in 55 entries across species and ATU types\nwith which we could compare our results (Table S1 in the OSF repository, sheet‘Success rates’).\nSuccess rates vary greatly, even within a single species and ATU type. This is not surprising as studies\ndiffered in tasks used, testing time, and in whether alternative solutions to the task were available.\nHowever, it seems that the highest success rates were produced in Sequential tool use studies– for\nall four great ape species, capuchin monkeys, rhesus macaques, baboons and rooks the percentage\nof successful individuals was substantially greater than 50% (but note that the sample sizes were\nextremely small)– with the exception of New Caledonian crows, whose success rate (14%) is similar\nto children’s average success rate in the current study (12%). However, it should be noted that these\nnumbers could misrepresent animals’abilities owing to publication bias and selective testing (i.e. in\nsome studies only those individuals who had solved simple tool use problems were able to advance\nto ATU tasks, e.g. Metevier,2006). The task which resembles most closely an already existing task\nis our Stick stick task (Sequential tool use, Experiment 1), as it was based on Taylor et al.’s( 2007)\ntask for New Caledonian crows (see also Taylor et al.,2011; Wimpenny et al.,2009). While the success\nrate in these three bird studies is at 100% and thus in stark contrast to the results reported here for\nchildren, one has to note that the crows had prior experience with one or more parts of the tasks.\nTherefore, before we can draw firm conclusions about the ATU abilities within and especially between\nspecies, further studies need to be conducted that allow more direct comparisons. Future research\ncould adapt tasks that have been used with non-human animals to humans (and other species),\nand tasks used in the current study could be adapted for use with non-human animals.\nEvidence for whether there was a cognitive hierarchy of the three examined ATU types was inconclu-\nsive. Experiment 1 showed that Tool set use yielded higher ATU and Correct success rates than Sequential\ntool use, as well as higher ATU rates than Metatool use, suggesting tentative evidence for the existence of\nsuch a hierarchy. However, there might be an alternative hypothesis explaining the differences between\nTool set and Sequential tool use: the low ATU and Correct success rates in the Sequential tool use\nrates could be explained by the fact that both tasks consisted of two separate apparatuses, which might\nhave been an additional source of difficulty for the children. Yet there is no evidence in the literature\nthat the use of (spatially separate) apparatuses or platforms poses an additional cognitive demand in\ntool use tasks for non-human animals or children (Gruber et al.,2019;J a c k s o n ,1942; Martin-Ordas\net al.,2012;M i l l e re ta l . ,2020; Mulcahy et al.,2005; Warden et al.,1940). Experiment 2 controlled for\nthe number of apparatuses (using a single apparatus for both ATU versions) and found that Tool set\nand Sequential tool use did not differ in either ATU nor Correct success rates. However, performance\nin Experiment 2 was found to be substantially affected by task-specific features unrelated to ATU type.\nFor example, in the Tool set use task of the box apparatus, some children failed to engage in ATU because\nthey did not use enough force to pierce the barrier or tried to circumvent it– which might have appeared\nas a potentially successful strategy as the distance between the tool and the reward was reduced and this\nmight have made it difficult for children to recognise this as a wrong attempt. Similarly, in the Tool set use\ntask of thetube apparatus (i.e. same ATU type but different apparatus) many children failed as they acci-\ndentally dropped the stick into the apparatus and were unable to retrieve it. These inadvertent design fea-\ntures might have artificially decreased children’s Tool set use abilities, and thus hindered the detection of a\npotential cognitive hierarchy. This emphasises the importance of investigating tool use with a multitude of\ntasks sharing the cognitive demand in question to be able to describe the emergence and development of\nthese skills abstracted from task idiosyncrasies (Völter et al.,2018).\nWhile the question whether there is a cognitive hierarchy among the three investigated ATU types\nrequires further research, attempts have been made to create a hierarchy on a broader level, sorting\ntool use and other tool-related behaviours by their suggested cognitive complexity (Neldner,2020;P u t t\net al., 2022; Visalberghi & Fragaszy,2012). While ATU was not explicitly included in Neldner (2020),\nwe suggest that it could be added at the upper end of the‘simple tool use’category to represent an intri-\nguing link to more cognitively challenging tool-related behaviours such as tool innovation (Figure 4).\nEvolutionary Human Sciences 17\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/ehs.2022.4 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nLike simple tool use, ATU‘requires goal-directed, relational action between multiple objects’(Neldner,\n2020, p. 16), but involves a greater number of objects, posing greater demands on working memory,\ninhibitory control, causal reasoning and imagination. In contrast to tool innovation, ATU requires no\nnew tools to be imagined; however, it requires imagining the correct sequence of actions and how the\nobjects involved relate to each other. Lastly, ATU is an intriguing addition to such a hierarchy, as it\nconsists of one sub-group of behaviours which links the tooluse and tool making categories, namely\nSecondary tool use.\nIn Secondary tool use, a tool is used to manufacture (or structurally modify) another tool\n(Shumaker et al.,2011). It seems to be unique to humans as it has not been reported in any wild non-\nhuman animals, and unenculturated, captive chimpanzees have shown no evidence for spontaneous\nSecondary tool use (Bandini et al.,2021). Although two bonobos and one orangutan were able to\nmake and subsequently use stone tools, this was only after extensive periods of teaching, training\nand sometimes moulding by humans (Roffman et al.,2012; Schick et al., 1999; Toth et al., 1993;\nToth & Schick, 2009; Wright, 1972; for a review see Bandini et al., 2021). Moreover, even after\nyears of practice, the apes did not overcome certain cognitive (and morphological) restrictions to pro-\nduce tools similar to the earliest hominin stone tools (Toth & Schick,2009). Secondary tool use is\nregarded as a major cognitive and technological breakthrough in human evolution which has itself\nshaped human cognition and culture substantially owing to the coevolution of technological advances\nand cognitive capacities, such as working memory, planning and technical reasoning (Haidle,2010;\nLombard & Haidle, 2012; Osiurak, 2020; Read, 2008). Future studies could create Secondary tool\nuse latent solution tests for children to find out more about the development of this ATU type.\nTool set and Sequential tool use were more difficult than Multifunctional tool use. This could be\nbecause of the larger relational complexity of ATU as, by definition, more objects are involved. This\nwould imply a greater demand on executive function. As inhibitory control, working memory and\nattention shifting are themselves still developing during childhood and beyond (Best et al.,2009,\n2011; Garon et al.,2008), executive function could indeed be a critical developmental bottleneck con-\ntributing to the difficulty of ATU for children (for a similar discussion of the importance of working\nmemory for the evolution of ATU see e.g. Haidle, 2010; Read, 2017; Read et al., 2021; Wynn &\nCoolidge, 2014). Indeed, there is evidence suggesting that toddlers’ performance in a tool selection\ntask is correlated with their performance in an inhibition and a short-term memory task (Pauen &\nBechtel-Kuehne, 2016) and that preschoolers’ ability to make tools after observing a demonstrator\nFigure 4. Adapted from Neldner’s( 2020; Figure 1.1) proposed hierarchy of tool-related behaviours. Here, we explicitly added\nAssociative tool use at the upper end of the Simple tool use category.\n18 E. Reindl et al.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/ehs.2022.4 Published online by Cambridge University Press\ncan be predicted by their score on a response inhibition task (S. R. Beck et al.,2016; Gönül et al.,2018).\nMore studies are needed to compare children’s performance in ATU and executive function tasks to\nbetter understand the cognitive demands involved in ATU and problem-solving in general.\nIn non-humans, ATU tasks have been used in latent solution tests as well as to study\nproblem-solving and causal cognition more generally. We hope that the tasks introduced here will\nbe a valuable addition to the pool of tests for investigating these and other topics in children and\nthat they will be used and amended in future research.\nAcknowledgements.
