  "abstract": "Background Biomedical research requires large, diverse samples to produce unbiased results. Retrospective data harmonization is often used to integrate existing datasets to create these samples, but the process is labor-intensive. Automated methods for matching variables across datasets can accelerate this process, particularly when harmonizing datasets with numerous variables and varied naming conventions. Research in this area has been limited, primarily focusing on lexical matching and ontology-based semantic matching. We aimed to develop new methods, leveraging large language models (LLMs) and ensemble learning, to automate variable matching. Methods This study utilized data from two GERAS cohort studies (European [EU] and Japan [JP]) obtained through the Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) Data Initiative’s AD workbench. We first manually created a dataset by matching 347 EU variables with 1322 candidate JP variables and treated matched variable pairs as positive instances and unmatched pairs as negative instances. We then developed four natural language processing (NLP) methods using state-of-the-art LLMs (E5, MPNet, MiniLM, and BioLORD-2023) to estimate variable similarity based on variable labels and derivation rules. A lexical matching method using fuzzy matching was included as a baseline model. In addition, we developed an ensemble-learning method, using the Random Forest (RF) model, to integrate individual NLP methods. RF was trained and evaluated on 50 trials. Each trial had a random split (4:1) of training and test sets, with the model’s hyperparameters optimized through cross-validation on the training set. For each EU variable, 1322 candidate JP variables were ranked based on NLP-derived similarity scores or RF’s probability scores, denoting their likelihood to match the EU variable. Ranking performance was measured by top- n hit ratio (HR- n ) and mean reciprocal rank (MRR). Results E5 performed best among individual methods, achieving 0.898 HR-30 and 0.700 MRR. RF performed better than E5 on all metrics over 50 trials ( P &lt; 0.001) and achieved an average HR-30 of 0.986 and MRR of 0.744. LLM-derived features contributed most to RF’s performance. One major cause of errors in automatic variable matching was ambiguous variable definitions. Conclusion NLP techniques (especially LLMs), combined with ensemble learning, hold great potential in automating variable matching and accelerating biomedical data harmonization.",
