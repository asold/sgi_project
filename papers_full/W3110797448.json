Over generations, this proclivity has led to considerably modify the surface of\nthe Earth, a phenomenon known as cumulative technological cu lture (\nOsiurak and Reynaud, 2020 ).\nThis is a fact: we are nowadays surrounded by artifacts (deﬁn ed here as tools made for a speciﬁc\npurpose). In this context, the epistemological belief can emer ge that humans have become mere\nmanipulators, much more concerned with how to manipulate arti facts to make them work than\nto understand how they work ( Osiurak et al., 2020 ). At a neurocognitive level, this belief has led\nto the hypothesis that the human brain has developed adaptive me chanisms enabling the selection\nand planning of the appropriate motor actions 1 to manipulate artifacts ( Heilman et al., 1982;\nRothi et al., 1991; Buxbaum, 2001; van Elk et al., 2014 ). Thus, when we see an artifact, we might\nautomatically activate not only the motor representation of how to grasp it (so-called structural\naﬀordance; e.g., a power grip to grasp and move a hammer from one location to another) but also\nthe motor representation of how to use it in a functional way 2 (so-called functional aﬀordance;\ne.g., a power grip and a broad oscillation of the elbow joint to g rasp and use a hammer to pound\na nail; Buxbaum and Kalénine, 2010; Thill et al., 2013 ; see also Bach et al., 2014; Kourtis and\nVingerhoets, 2015; Kourtis et al., 2018 ). This is the automatic activation hypothesis of functional\naﬀordances3. In this Opinion article, we question the theoretical and empi rical validity of the strong\n1When someone uses a tool with an object, two kinds of relationshi ps can be described, namely, tool-hand relationships and\ntool-object relationships ( Goldenberg, 2013). We will use the term “motor action” to refer to the bodily action pe rformed by\nthe user that involves a tool-hand relationship. Motor actions co ncern preferentially the manipulative part of the tool/artifact.\nNote that motor actions are not limited to the use of tools but can als o concern non-tool use actions (e.g., grasping, reaching).\nIn addition, we will use the term “mechanical action” to refer to t he physical action performed by the tool with the object (i.e.,\ntool-object relationships). Mechanical actions concern preferent ially the active part of the tool/artifact.\n2The term “functional way” refers to the use associated with the usual function of the artifact, that is, the purpose for which\nthe artifact was made (e.g., pounding a nail for a hammer, driving a s crew for a screwdriver).\n3The terms “gesture engram” ( Buxbaum, 2001 ), “visuokinesthetic motor engram” ( Heilman et al., 1982 ), “spatial-temporal\nmovement representation” (Heilman and Watson, 2008 ), “manipulation knowledge” (Bach et al., 2014; van Elk et al., 2014 ) or\n“representation of motor programs for acquired tool use skills” ( Johnson-Frey et al., 2005 ), among others, have also been used\nas synonyms of functional aﬀordance. Nevertheless, even if the t erminology varies, the concept remains similar and diﬀers\nfrom the initial deﬁnition of aﬀordance proposed by Gibson (1986; for a review about the multitude of meanings of the term\naﬀordance, see Osiurak et al., 2017 ).\nOsiurak et al. On the Temporal Dynamics of Tool Use\nFIGURE 1 |Cognitive approaches to tool use. As shown in(A,B) the initial project of the embodied cognition approach was to propose an alternative to the classical\namodal approach in assuming that tool use is not based on a cascade mechanism “conceptual system⇒ sensorimotor system” but on the automatic activation of\nfunctional affordances within a unique conceptual/sensorimotor system. As explained in the present article,(C) the cascade mechanism through which technical\nreasoning and motor control interact is one of the key assumptions of the technical reasoning hypothesis, which also posits that this mechanism is reiterative, if\nnecessary.\nform of this hypothesis and propose an alternative view\nderived from the technical reasoning hypothesis and based\non the idea that technical reasoning and motor control\ninteract together via a cascade mechanism. Understanding\nhow individuals are able to use tools necessarily requires\ndiscussing ﬁndings from both behavioral and brain-related\nstudies (e.g., neurophysiology, neuroimaging). In this art icle, we\nwill focus on behavioral ﬁndings, suggesting that the discu ssion\ninitiated here is incomplete and would need to be extended to\nbrain-related ﬁndings.\nTHE STRONG FORM OF THE AUTOMATIC\nACTIVATION HYPOTHESIS OF\nFUNCTIONAL AFFORDANCES\nThe automatic activation hypothesis of functional aﬀordance s\ncan be viewed as a strong form of the embodied cognition\napproach to tool use 4. The embodied cognition approach has\n4Here, we mean by “embodied cognition approach” any embodied cognitio n\napproach assuming that humans possess knowledge that is distributed in the\ndiﬀerent sensorimotor systems (e.g., Barsalou, 2008, 2009; Thill et al., 2013; van Elk\net al., 2014; Buxbaum, 2017 ). In other words, this does not concern the ecological\nemerged in contradiction to the classical amodal approach,\nwhich considers that our understanding of the physical world\nis conceived in an abstract way (\nFodor, 1975 ; see also Mahon\nand Caramazza, 2008; Mahon, 2015 ). In this classical amodal\napproach, the conceptual level is distinguished from the\nsensorimotor level: we conceive our actions ﬁrst, and then w e\ndecide which motor actions to perform ( Figure 1A). By contrast,\nthe embodied cognition approach assumes that the conceptual\nlevel is grounded in our sensorimotor systems ( Figure 1B). Thus,\nconceiving an action with an artifact consists of simulating\nthe interactions we have had with it at the sensorimotor level\n(\nBarsalou, 2008, 2009; Mizelle and Wheaton, 2010; Thill et al. ,\n2013). This approach in its strong form inevitably leads to\nconsidering that seeing an artifact automatically activat es the\nmotor representations associated with its usual function , namely\nfunctional aﬀordances (e.g., Rothi et al., 1991; Buxbaum, 2001;\nBach et al., 2014; van Elk et al., 2014 ). We emphasize the word\n“inevitably” because this automatic activation hypothesis is the\nonly way of making a clear diﬀerence between the classical\namodal approach and the embodied cognition approach. Indeed,\napproach to perception initiated by Gibson (1986) , that is, a nonrepresentational\napproach, which is sometimes assimilated to the embodied cognition a pproach.\nFrontiers in Human Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 2 December 2020 | Volume 14 | Article 579378\nOsiurak et al. On the Temporal Dynamics of Tool Use\nif these motor representations can be activated via a kind of\ncascade mechanism involving non-sensorimotor representat ions\nat earlier stages, then this amounts to proposing the same\nframework as that of the classical amodal approach (i.e.,\nconceptual level ⇒ sensorimotor level). Therefore, these motor\nrepresentations must be activated without requiring additi onal\ncognitive processes, hence the automatic activation hypothe sis.\nWe emphasize the phrase “its usual function” because the\nembodied cognition approach aims to propose an alternative\nway of considering the conceptual level (i.e., sensorimotor , not\nabstract). In this respect, this approach does not aim to explain\nhow our motor-control system can perform non-tool-related\nmotor actions, such as grasping or reaching because otherwis e\nthis would not be an alternative but rather a complementary\napproach to the classical amodal approach. In other words,\nthe interest of the embodied cognition approach precisely lies\nin assuming that motor representations are involved at the\nconceptual level in order to specify how to use artifacts accor ding\nto their usual function 5.\nTHE ORIENTATION EFFECT\nThe idea that functional aﬀordances are automatically activ ated\nby the sight of artifacts is more an assumption than a hypothesi s\nfor embodied cognition models of tool use. Put diﬀerently,\nthis assumption has generated a great number of interesting\nﬁndings. However, much less empirical eﬀort has been spent\non investigating its validity. Key evidence may come from th e\norientation eﬀect initially reported by\nTucker and Ellis (1998) .\nIn their seminal article, they presented participants with pict ures\nof artifacts with the handle oriented toward either the righ t\nor the left. The orientation of the handle was not relevant to\nthe task, which consisted in judging the vertical orientati on\n(upright/inverted). Yet, participants were faster to respond w ith\na right-hand keypress when the handle was oriented to the\nright and vice versa.\nTucker and Ellis (1998) did not interpret\nthis orientation eﬀect as evidence for an automatic activati on\nof functional aﬀordances, but of motor aﬀordances, without\nspecifying clearly whether it may concern structural aﬀordan ce,\nfunctional aﬀordances, or both. Later, they stated that the\norientation eﬀect (i.e., the mere presence of faster keypress\nresponses when the handle is oriented to the same side) was\nfar more consistent with a structural rather than a function al\naﬀordance interpretation (\nSymes et al., 2007 ; see also Vingerhoets\net al., 2009 ). Hence, there appears to be a gap between reporting\n5Some hybrid amodal-embodied attempts have been proposed on the grounds t hat\nextreme views have little empirical support (e.g., Chatterjee, 2010; Dove, 2011;\nBorghi et al., 2017 ; see also Meteyard et al., 2012; Matheson et al., 2015; Michel,\nin press). These hybrid attempts have been made in the ﬁeld of linguistic/se mantic\nprocessing (i.e., when applied to tools, naming a tool, or knowing its usual function\nor context of use). However, in the ﬁeld of “tool use” (i.e., act ual tool use or\npantomime of use), most of the models have adopted a more extreme version\nof the embodied cognition approach, in suggesting that tool use i s based on the\nactivation of sensorimotor representations about manipulation, th at is, functional\naﬀordances (e.g.,\nBuxbaum and Kalénine, 2010; Thill et al., 2013; van Elk et al.,\n2014). This is also true for early models, even if they were not labeled as embo died\n(Heilman et al., 1982; Rothi et al., 1991; Cubelli et al., 2000; Buxbaum, 2001).\nthis so-called orientation eﬀect and demonstrating that seei ng\nan artifact automatically activates the motor representati on of\nhow to use it for its usual function (i.e., functional aﬀordan ces).\nHowever, as discussed above, the main problem is that, if this\norientation eﬀect only concerns structural aﬀordances and, a s\na result, is not speciﬁc to tool-use actions, then it does not\nprovide any support for the embodied cognition approach. In\naddition, the generalization and robustness of this orientat ion\neﬀect have been subject to an intense debate (e.g., for conﬂic ting\nresults,\nAnderson et al., 2002; Cho and Proctor, 2010, 2011,\n2013; Matheson and Thompson-Schill, 2019; Pellicano et al.,\n2019; Kostov and Janyan, in press; Pellicano and Binkofski,\nin press\n; for a review, see Osiurak and Badets, 2016; Azaad\net al., 2019 ). To sum up, this orientation eﬀect at best reﬂects\nthe automatic activation of structural aﬀordances but not of\nfunctional aﬀordances. Yet, many studies have capitalized on it\nto develop a strong form of the embodied cognition approach to\ntool use, organized around the automatic activation of func tional\naﬀordances (e.g.,\nCreem and Proﬃtt, 2001; Grèzes et al., 2003;\nBuxbaum and Kalénine, 2010; Bach et al., 2014; van Elk et al.,\n2014; Kourtis and Vingerhoets, 2015; Kourtis et al., 2018\n).\nFROM THEORETICAL ISSUES\nThe automatic activation hypothesis of functional aﬀordance s\nalso presents other limitations. We have also emphasized that\nthis hypothesis is not economic at a motor level or that it\ndoes not explain what happens when the tool-use action is not\nunimanual but bimanual (\nOsiurak et al., 2011; Osiurak and\nBadets, 2016 ). Here, we will limit our discussion to another\ntheoretical limitation, which concerns the temporal dynami cs\nof the so-called automatic activation, namely, an aspect that is\nrarely addressed by the proponents of the embodied cognition\napproach (but see\nBub et al., 2018 ; see also Trumpp et al., 2014 ).\nThe outstanding question is how these functional aﬀordances\nactivate. Let’s elaborate on it to answer this question.\nA ﬁrst possibility is that looking at the manipulative part of\nan artifact (e.g., a handle) is suﬃcient to activate the asso ciated\nfunctional aﬀordance. This possibility is unlikely. Indeed, looking\nat the manipulative part, say the handle, is not enough to\ndetermine what is the usual function of the artifact. At best , we\nmight automatically activate some structural aﬀordances (e .g.,\ngrasping or reaching actions) based on the physical properties\nof the handle. In addition, it is impossible to activate the\nappropriate functional aﬀordances by merely looking at the\nhandle of the artifact because the same handle can be associat ed\nwith a multitude of diﬀerent artifacts with diﬀerent uses. To\nsolve this issue, a second possibility is that functional aﬀor dances\nare automatically activated by the sight of the active part of\nthe artifact (e.g., the head of the hammer). However, this ra ises\nanother theoretical issue. Functional aﬀordances are thoug ht to\nspecify the kinematic and postural parameters associated with\nthe motor action useful to use the artifact for its usual functi on\n(e.g.,\nvan Elk et al., 2014 ). These parameters are derived from\nthe experience we have with artifacts and directly targets th e\nmanipulative part, namely, the contact zone between the user\nFrontiers in Human Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 3 December 2020 | Volume 14 | Article 579378\nOsiurak et al. On the Temporal Dynamics of Tool Use\nand the artifact. Therefore, it appears impossible to envisage\nthat functional aﬀordances are automatically activated onl y by\nlooking at the functional part. They must also be activated\nafter looking at the manipulative part. In other words, the\nautomatic activation of this functional aﬀordances necessa rily\nrequires an exploratory gaze pattern consisting in looking at the\nfunctional part, ﬁrst, and at the manipulative part, second. Th is is\nnevertheless not predicted by the automatic activation hypot hesis\nof functional aﬀordances. This also raises the theoretical q uestion\nof when the functional aﬀordances are activated. For instanc e, are\nthey activated just after looking at the functional part or ra ther\nafter looking at the manipulative part? What if the functional\npart does not seem appropriate for the current purpose? Do we\nnevertheless pursue the procedure of activating the function al\naﬀordances associated with the artifact?\nTO EMPIRICAL COUNTERARGUMENTS\nThe idea that people focus ﬁrst on the active part of a tool/artif act\nhas been supported by a signiﬁcant body of evidence. For\ninstance,\nvan Elk et al. (2008) presented participants with\npictures of a model using artifacts and asked them to detect\nwhether the goal location was correct (i.e., whether the act ive\npart was oriented toward the correct part of the model) or\nwhether the grip was correct (i.e., whether the manipulative\npart was correctly grasped) They found that the detection\nof the correctness of the goal location was faster than the\ndetection of the correctness of the grip. Other studies have\ncorroborated this pattern of results in an observational con text\n(e.g.,\nMassen and Prinz, 2007; Naish et al., 2013; Nicholson\net al., 2017; Decroix and Kalénine, 2018, 2019 ) or in a motor\nintention paradigm ( Osiurak and Badets, 2014; Badets et al.,\n2017). This pattern was also found in another study in which\nparticipants were asked to decide whether word or picture\nstimuli of artifacts shared the same manipulation or the same\nfunction (\nGarcea and Mahon, 2012 ). Again, responses were\nfaster for function judgments than for manipulation judgmen ts.\nMore direct evidence for the aforementioned exploratory patte rn\nalso comes from two recent eye-tracking studies, which have\ndemonstrated that participants look ﬁrst at the active part\nof artifacts and then at the manipulative part (\nFederico and\nBrandimonte, 2019, 2020 ). However, such a manipulative pattern\ndoes not suggest a motoric automatism generated by the mere\nobservation of artifacts (i.e., the automatic activation h ypothesis).\nIndeed, when the artifact shown is thematically inconsiste nt with\nthe object presented (e.g., a bottle and a peaked cap), ﬁxations are\nlonger on the active part, indicating that people need to generat e\na potential mechanical action with the artifact and the objec t\nbefore engaging on the manipulative aspect. Crucially, the sa me\nnon-manipulative visual-attentional pattern can be obtaine d by\nusing an explicit non-motoric task (\nFederico and Brandimonte,\n2020). Speciﬁcally, when people look at object-artifact pairs\nwith the aim of recognizing them (i.e., a yes-no recognition\nparadigm), the artifact’s active part receives more ﬁxations ,\nirrespective of thematic consistency. Taken together, thes e results\nhighlight how people tend to use ﬁrst the information needed to\nunderstand the mechanical action (involving the active part of\nthe artifact), and then, when they are going to use an artifact , the\ninformation needed to select/plan the motor action involvin g the\nmanipulative part.\nTwo other studies deserve mention (\nKourtis and Vingerhoets,\n2015; Kourtis et al., 2018 ). In both studies, participants were\npresented with pictures of an artifact for 1,000 s ( Kourtis and\nVingerhoets, 2015 ) or for 500–1,500 s ( Kourtis et al., 2018 ),\nafter which an arrow was overlaid on the artifact. Participan ts\nwere asked to respond to make a left-hand response to a left-\npointing arrow and vice versa. The artifact was tilted at an\nangle of 45 ◦ with its manipulative part pointing downward. In\nhalf the trials the active part was oriented toward the left (a nd\nthe manipulative part toward the right) and vice versa for the\nother half. In both studies, they found that responses were fa ster\nwhen the arrow pointed to the active part of the artifact than\nto the manipulative part. This ﬁnding, which is the opposite\nof the orientation eﬀect initially reported by\nTucker and Ellis\n(1998), is consistent with many studies that have reported this\nopposite result, conﬁrming its lack of robustness (see above).\nKourtis et al. (2018) also observed that the congruency eﬀect\nbetween the orientation of the active part of the artifact and the\norientation of the arrow preferentially activated the left i nferior\nparietal lobe (Talairach coordinates: x = − 60, y = − 34, z =\n34). A potential interpretation of these ﬁndings is that they\nreﬂect the activation of speciﬁc motor representations of how\nto manipulate the artifact (i.e., functional aﬀordances). Ho wever,\nanother interpretation of these ﬁndings can be provided from\nrecent advances.\nThe coordinates found by\nKourtis et al. (2018) are very close\nto the ones reported by the meta-analysis conducted by Reynaud\net al. (2016; i.e., x = −56, y = −31, z = 36) and corresponds to the\nbrain area PF. In this meta-analysis, the activation of this br ain\narea was associated with studies in which participants had to\nfocus on the mechanical action between the active part of the t ool\nand the object presented (see also\nReynaud et al., 2019 ). Damage\nto this brain area is known to induce tool-use disorders (i.e. ,\napraxia of tool use) in left brain-damaged patients not only wh en\nthey have to use and select appropriate familiar tools/artifact s but\nalso novel tools to solve mechanical problems (e.g., Goldenberg\nand Spatt, 2009 ; for review, see Osiurak et al., 2020 ). There\nis a consensus to consider that functional aﬀordances cannot\nbe useful to select or use novel tools because they are not\nassociated with a speciﬁc function and, as a result, a speciﬁc\nmanipulation (e.g.,\nBuxbaum, 2017; Caruana and Cuccio, 2017 ).\nIn other words, the brain area PF could be involved not in\nthe selection/planning of motor actions associated withwit h the\nmanipulation of artifacts (i.e., functional aﬀordances) but rather\nin the understanding of the mechanical actions that involve s\nthe artifact/tool—particularly, its active part—with an obje ct,\nirrespective of the familiarity of the artifact/tool or the o bject.\nThese ﬁndings question a potential functional-aﬀordance-ba sed\ninterpretation about the activation of the brain area PF foun d\nin\nKourtis et al. (2018) . An alternative interpretation is that this\nactivation reﬂects the involvement of a speciﬁc cognitive pro cess\nconcerned by the mechanical action that can be performed\nbetween the active part of the artifact and a potential object. In the\nFrontiers in Human Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 4 December 2020 | Volume 14 | Article 579378\nOsiurak et al. On the Temporal Dynamics of Tool Use\nnext section, we will elaborate on this “speciﬁc cognitive pro cess, ”\nthat is, technical reasoning.\nTHE TECHNICAL REASONING\nHYPOTHESIS\nThe automatic activation hypothesis of functional aﬀordance s\nis appealing and is fully consistent with the current widesprea d\nembodied cognition approach. This hypothesis is nevertheless\nsubject to some theoretical and empirical limitations, whic h\nquestion its validity. More speciﬁcally, it does not predict\nthe existence of a cascade mechanism (First, functional part\n⇒ conceptual level; then, manipulative part ⇒ sensorimotor\nlevel.) Interestingly, this cascade mechanism is a key aspec t\nof the technical reasoning hypothesis, which is akin to the\nclassical amodal approach ( Figure 1C;\nOsiurak et al., 2010 ;\nfor a similar view, see also Goldenberg, 2013; Osiurak and\nBadets, 2016; Osiurak and Heinke, 2018 ). Technical reasoning\ncan be broadly deﬁned as the ability to reason about physical\nobject properties. This nonverbal reasoning is both causal (i .e.,\npredicting the eﬀects on the environment of tool-use/making\nor construction actions) and analogical (i.e., transfer of what\nis understood from one situation to another). The technical -\nreasoning hypothesis assumes that people use tools—but also\nmake them or build constructions—to solve physical problems\nin their everyday life (e.g, how to hang a picture on a wall; how\nto cut bread). In this respect, it diverges from most approaches\nto tool use in considering that tool use and the underlying\ncognitive processes are driven by the need to solve physical\nproblems. To solve these problems, individuals ﬁrst generate\nappropriate mechanical actions (e.g., cutting, lever) throug h\ntechnical reasoning. Then, they select the appropriate motor\nactions via the motor-control system in order to realize the\nmechanical action generated through technical reasoning. This\ncascade mechanism can be reiterated if necessary, for insta nce,\nwhen the mechanical action generated does not work, which\ncan require the generation of another mechanical action or t he\nselection of most appropriate tools.\nThe technical reasoning hypothesis has been mainly\ndeveloped from studies in which participants are asked to\nactually use tools with objects contrary to most of the studi es\ndiscussed here. According to this hypothesis, technical rea soning\nis not viewed as involved in semantic processing, such as when\nsomeone has to categorize an object as natural or manmade or\nto name it. Nevertheless, this hypothesis does not assume tha t\npeople need to be in the presence of tools and objects to reason\nabout the potential mechanical actions that can be performed\nwith them. This reasoning can be done oﬄine, for instance,\nwhen someone reasons about which nail of the workshop can be\nuseful to hang a paint a picture on the wall of the living room.\nIn this respect, it can be considered that the presentation of\npictures of artifacts on a computer screen can lead participants\nto initiate such reasoning. Even if this hypothesis assumes a\ncascade mechanism that seems to be consistent with the ﬁndings\ndiscussed here, it is noteworthy that a signiﬁcant theoreti cal\neﬀort is needed to explain how technical reasoning can interfe re\nin recognition tasks (for discussion of this limitation, se e\nBuxbaum, 2017 ). The fact remains that the technical reasoning\nhypothesis oﬀers a viable alternative to the automatic activa tion\nhypothesis of functional aﬀordances to explain how humans\nconceive the diﬀerent objects of the environment as potential\ntools. Having said this, we believe it is noteworthy that a\ntheoretical eﬀort remains to be made to reconcile the technic al\nreasoning hypothesis with the automatic activation hypothes is\nof functional aﬀordances. Indeed, whereas the initial goal o f the\nformer is to explain how humans select and use tools to solve\nphysical problems (i.e., focus on the mechanical action betwe en\nthe tool and object in a context of problem solving), the latte r has\nbeen developed to account for how humans acquire knowledge\nabout tools based on their sensorimotor interactions with th em\n(i.e., focus on the motor action between the tool and the hand in\na context of knowledge acquisition).\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nFO developed the article concept and drafted the manuscript.\nGF, MB, ER, and ML provided critical revisions.
