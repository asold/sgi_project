  "full_text": "Interpretable tourism demand forecasting with temporal fusion\ntransformers amid COVID-19\nBinrong Wu 1 & Lin Wang 1 & Yu-Rong Zeng 2\nAccepted: 9 October 2022\n# The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2022\nAbstract\nAn innovative ADE-TFT interpretable tourism demand forecasting model was proposed to address the issue of the insufficient\ninterpretability of existing tourism demand forecasting. This model effectively optimizes the parameters of the Temporal Fusion\nTransformer (TFT) using an adaptive differential evolution algorithm (ADE). TFT is a brand-new attention-based deep learning\nmodel that excels in prediction research by fusing high-performance prediction with time-dynamic interpretable analysis. The\nTFT model can produce explicable predictions of tourism demand, including attention analysis of time steps and the ranking of\ninput factors’ relevance. While doing so, this study adds something unique to the literature on tourism by using historical tourism\nvolume, monthly new confirmed cases of travel destinations, and big data from travel forums and search engines to increase the\nprecision of forecasting tourist volume during the COVID-19 pandemic. The mood of travelers and the many subjects they spoke\nabout throughout off-season and peak travel periods were examined using a convolutional neural network model. In addition, a\nnovel technique for choosing keywords from Google Trends was suggested. In other words, the Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic\nmodel was used to categorize the major travel-related subjects of forum postings, after which the most relevant search terms for\neach topic were determined. According to the findings, it is possible to estimate tourism demand during the COVID-19 pandemic\nby combining quantitative and emotion-based characteristics.\nKeywords Interpretable tourism demand forecasting . Deep learning . Text mining . COVID-19\n1 Introduction\nIn many countries, the tourism industry is a pillar industry\nowing to its increasing contribution to the gross domestic\nproduct [1]. However, as the tourism industry is characterized\nby the “spatial mobility of people, ” it is one of the industries\nmost affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [ 2].\nThe World Health Organiza tion (WHO) has declared\nCOVID-19 a global threat [ 3]. More than 560 million cases\nof infection and more than 6 million fatalities had been\npublished globally as of July 2022. The rapid global expan-\nsion of COVID-19 is substantially impairing human life as\nwell as international trade [ 4, 5]. Research on the effects of\nCOVID-19 on the world is currently in high demand [ 6, 7].\nDuring the outbreak, most countries implemented strict inter-\nnational and domestic travel restrictions to contain the spread\nof infection [ 8]. With the pandemic under control and many\ncountries relaxing travel restrictions, the tourism industry has\nbeen slowly recovering. To move forward, accurate tourism\ndemand forecasting following the COVID-19 pandemic is\nimportant to the strategic planning of tourism destinations\nand tourism-related enterprises [ 9]. However, the uncertainty\nresulting from COVID-19 leads to major challenges in fore-\ncasting tourism demand.\nSome previous tourism volume forecasting studies have\nbeen based on large amounts of historical data. However,\nhistorical data for tourism demand forecasting cannot reflect\nthe impact of sudden and unexpected events such as diseases,\ndisasters, or crises. Therefore, explanatory variables that can\nreflect the impact of uncertain events and monitor visitor be-\nhavior and satisfaction on time are necessary when predicting\ntourism demand during the COVID-19 period. Big data\n* Yu-Rong Zeng\nzyrhbue@gmail.com; zyr@hbue.edu.cn\nBinrong Wu\nbinronghust@foxmail.com\nLin Wang\nwanglin982@gmail.com\n1 School of Management, Huazhong University of Science and\nTechnology, Wuhan 430074, China\n2 Hubei University of Economics, 430205 Wuhan, China\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/s10489-022-04254-0\n/ Published online: 27 October 2022\nApplied Intelligence (2023) 53:14493–14514\nsatisfies these characteristics; hence, it can provide the possi-\nbility for accurate and timely tourism demand prediction [ 10,\n11]. In addition, to provide high-frequency information, big\ndata can show visitors ’ preferences and changes in their pref-\nerences in real-time.\nWebsite traffic data and search engine data have been use-\nful in improving the accuracy of tourism demand, tourist at-\ntraction demand, and hotel room demand [ 12, 13]. Besides,\ntravelers prefer to trust other travelers ’ information or com-\nments on social media platforms, rather than information from\nservice providers [ 14]. As a result, online reviews and user-\ngenerated content have gained immense importance [ 15, 16],\nthus proving the usefulness of well-known sites such as\nTripAdvisor in forecasting travel demand success [ 17, 18].\nBig data shared on online social media can help predict rapid\nchanges in tourist preferences and popular trends in destina-\ntions by analyzing the topics discussed in online discourse\n[19].\nVolume-based data like Google Trends and online media\ndata have their pros and cons in predicting tourism volume\n[20]. For example, a high search volume about a travel desti-\nnation on Google Trends does not necessarily reflect the great\ninterest of travelers, and positive media messages can indicate\nan increase but not the exact amount. In forecasting tourism\ndemand, integrating quantitative and emotion-based comple-\nmentary variables are valuable and meaningful [ 21]. Poor\ntourism volume prediction may result from insufficient diver-\nsity of data, particularly during the COVID-19 period. Li et al.\n[22] emphasized that the locations where policymakers can\nquickly plan may be significantly impacted by the application\nof multi-source data. Therefore, by merging data from other\ncomplementing sources, this issue may be solved.\nThe coupling relationship between influencing factors and\ntourism volume data in the current tourism demand forecast-\ning models is rarely examined and explained [ 23]. Although\ndeep learning models have been used by some researchers to\nanticipate time series with excellent accuracy [24], experimen-\ntal models are unable to describe how deep learning models\nfunction. The research ’s findings cannot persuade those em-\nployed in the tourism industry due to a lack of explanatory\npower. Therefore, further research needs to be done to deter-\nmine how tourism demand forecasts may be understood ef-\nfectively. Given the limitations of previous research, this work\nimproved the Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFT) using an\nadaptive differential evolution algorithm (ADE) and then cre-\nated a high-level, understandable forecasting model for tour-\nism demand. There are four primary contributions to this\nwork.\n(a) This study’ s main contribution was the new and\nthoughtful strategy which is choosing keywords from\nGoogle Trends. The primary subjects in the travel\nforum content were examined using the LDA topic\nmodel, and then the most pertinent search terms were\nchosen based on each topic.\n(b) This is one of the initial attempts to develop a temporal\nfusion transformed explanatory monthly tourism de-\nmand forecasting model. The TFT ’s parameters were\noptimized using an adaptive differential evolution algo-\nrithm, which boosts prediction stability and accuracy.\nThis work added to the knowledge in the academic com-\nmunity about the interpretability of input variables used\nin tourism forecasting and offered a fresh perspective on\nexplicable time series forecasting.\n(c) Text from travel forum threads was automatically ex-\ntracted using a deep learning algorithm. The goal of this\nwork is to show how travel forum posts may be used to\nforecast tourism volume. The CNN model was used to\nexamine the attitudes of passengers and the various sub-\njects that they discussed both during low- and high-\nseason travel.\n(d) Using\nhistorical tourism volume, monthly new con-\nfirmed cases of travel destinations, travel forum data,\nand search engine data, it is possible to project tourism\nvolume for the COVID-19 period with satisfactory fore-\ncasting performance. The outcomes show that emotion-\nbased and quantitative variables work together to esti-\nmate tourism demand.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2\nprovides a detailed literature review of the common methods\nof tourism volume forecasting, tourism forecasting with on-\nline community dynamics, and tourism forecasting with\nsearch engine data. Section 3 discusses the text mining tech-\nnique and the proposed ADE-TFT model. Section 4 presents\nthe data retrieval, experiment process, results, and managerial\nimplications. The last section concludes the study and states\ncurrent limitations and potential future directions.\n2 Literature review\n2.1 Common methods of tourism volume forecasting\nVarious pieces of literature discuss methods of tourism de-\nmand forecasting. For example, Song et al. [ 25] reviewed\n211 papers published between 1968 and 2018. Their study\nshed light on the evolution of tourism demand forecasting\nmethods. Tourism volume forecasting models that have been\napplied are time series analysis approaches, econometric ap-\nproaches, and emerging artificial intelligence (AI) techniques\n[26–30]. Popular time series analysis approaches include the\nautoregressive moving average model, exponential smoothing\nmodel, and structural time series model, which perform well\nin linear forecasting [ 31]. According to recent systematic re-\nviews, examples of widely used econometric approaches\n14494 B. Wu et al.\nmodels in tourism demand forecasting are error correction\nmodels, autoregressive distributed lag models, VAR, and\ntime-varying parameters [ 32]. Owing to the strong nonlinear\nfitting ability of several AI-based techniques, an increasing\nnumber of scholars have paid attention to the application of\nAI in tourism demand prediction, such as artificial neural net-\nworks and support vector regression [ 33, 34]. For example,\nBi, Li, and Fan [ 35] proposed a deep learning model to fore-\ncast tourism demand with time-series imaging. Although there\nare a number of new strategies for estimating tourism demand,\nnone of them is necessarily superior to the others, according to\nthe no free lunch theorems [ 36].\nMost of the existing tourism demand forecasting models\nare limited to the research on the selection and processing of\ninput variables while ignoring the analysis and interpretation\nof the coupling relationship between influencing factors and\ntourism demand [37]. The more important decision-making is\nin the work of tourism practitioners, the higher the explanatory\npower required by the model. The interpretability methods\ncommonly used in deep learning are not suitable for time\nseries forecasting. Different from previous studies, this study\nintroduced a TFT model to resolve the heterogeneity of data in\ntourism demand forecasting to obtain high performance, and\nalso makes time series forecasting interpretable and satisfies\nthe needs of tourism decision-makers.\n2.2 Tourism forecasting with online community\ndynamics\nOnline travel communities can influence the choices of poten-\ntial visitors. Measuring potential visitors ’ dynamics and emo-\ntions is necessary to see if predictive information can be ex-\ntracted to make meaningful tourism demand predictions [ 38].\nOnline community dynamics are divided into two categories,\nnamely online reviews and travel forum text. Many studies\nexplore the effects of reviews on tourist behavior [ 39].\nHowever, only a few studies used online travel community\ndynamics to conduct tourism forecasting. Colladon et al. [ 40]\nanalyzed online community dynamics and provided new pre-\ndictors for tourism demand forecasting. As online reviews\nsometimes include deceptive content, which is generated by\npeople who share false experiences and judgments to promote\nbusinesses, travel forum text appears more authentic and\nreliable.\nThe use of travel forum text in tourism forecasting is\nonly emerging [ 41]. In this study, the performance of\ntravel forum text in tourism demand forecasting is further\nanalyzed. The LDA topic model was used to identify the\nmain topics of travel forum posts, and the CNN model\nwas employed to analyze the mood of travelers and dif-\nferent topics that travelers talked about during travel off-\nseason and peak season.\n2.3 Tourism forecasting with search engine data\nAs the Internet develops, tourists become increasingly\nempowered to obtain informat ion about their tourism des-\ntinations anytime and anywhere. Travelers search the\nInternet for tourism information to make decisions about\ntheir future behavior. Ther efore, as search engine data\nhave distinct advantages of high frequency and potential\nto sensitively capture the behavior of travelers, scholars\nhave focused on using popular Internet search data (e.g.,\nGoogle Trends and Baidu Index) to make tourism predic-\ntions [ 42]. In most cases, search engine data can signifi-\ncantly develop the forecasting performance of tourism de-\nmand [ 43, 44]. For example, Li and Law [ 45]p r o p o s e da\ndecomposition-based perspective to forecast tourist vol-\numes to Hong Kong using Google Trends and obtained\nsatisfactory forecasting performances. Li et al. [ 46]u s e d\nprincipal component analysis to decorrelate the selected\nBaidu Index to enhance the forecasting performance of\ntourism demand. Yang et al. [ 47] compared Baidu data\nwith Google Trends in tourism demand forecasting for\nHainan Province. As Baidu Index has a larger market\nshare in China, using Baidu Index can obtain better fore-\ncasting performance. Google Trends is selected as the\nsource of search data to forecast tourism demand in the\nthree main European capitals because Google has the big-\ngest market share in Europe.\nKeyword selection is a critical step in search engine\ndata modeling [ 48]. Li et al. [ 49] summarized two main\nmethods of keyword selection. The first method is to\nemploy Google-related categories provided by Google\nTrends to make tourism demand forecasts [ 50]. The sec-\nond method is to reduce the dimension of search engine\ndata by a few keywords or composite index. The method\nof choosing appropriate keywords needs to be further\nexplored. Compared with previous studies, this study\nproposed an innovative method by using LDA to analyze\ntravel forum posts and to select the most predictive\nsearch keywords.\n3M e t h o d o l o g y\nWith a focus on enhancing newly confirmed cases,\nGoogle Trends, and online media data ’s forecasting effec-\ntiveness, this study offered a unique data-driven strategy\nfor interpretable tourism volume forecasting for the\nCOVID-19 period. The suggested forecasting method is\ndisplayed in Fig. 1. The three European capitals of Paris,\nA m s t e r d a m ,a n dL i s b o nw e r es e l e c t e da se x a m p l e si nt h i s\nstudy since they are the most visited cities and because\nthe COVID-19 epidemic has a significant impact on their\ntourism industries. Data from travel forums were gathered\n14495Interpretable tourism demand forecasting with temporal fusion transformers amid COVID-19\nfrom TripAdvisor. The most foretelling search terms from\nGoogle Trends were chosen for the unique analysis of\ntravel forum posts using the La tent Dirichlet Allocation\n(LDA) topic model. A convolutional neural network\n(CNN), a deep learning model, was used to extract textual\nfeatures from travel forum entries. Data on newly con-\nfirmed cases were gathered each month to reflect the ep-\nidemic scenario in popular tourist areas. The ADE-TFT\nmodel was then updated with information on textual fea-\ntures, historical tourism volume, monthly new confirmed\ncases of tourism destinations, Google Trends, and the\nnumber of postings.\n3.1 Text-convolutional neural network\nFigure 2 shows the model architecture of the convolutional\nneural network, which is similar to that of Wu et al. [ 51]. CNN\ncan learn the interaction between the constituent semantic\nfragments to make full use of the semantic relations between\nthe modes of the travel forum text [ 52, 53].\nThe preprocessing of text data has three steps: the first step\nis the tokenization and filtering of stop words and punctuation\n(e.g., “in,”“ the,”“ is”). Second, we convert each sentence into\nthe same length by the padded sequence. Specifically, a fixed\nsentence length is determined, then any words that exceed the\nFig. 1 Forecasting framework of this study\n14496 B. Wu et al.\nspecified length will be removed, and any sentences that do\nnot reach the specified length will be filled in with zeros.\nThird, each word is converted into a unique vector by a word\nembedding model (word2vec).\nIn convolutional layers with different convolution kernel\nsizes, vectors of different dimensions are obtained. In the\npooling layer, 1-Max-pooling is implemented to extract the\nmaximum feature. Thereafter, the first full connection em-\nploys “ReLU” as an activation function, and the second full\nconnection layer uses “Softmax” as an activation function.\nFinally, the CNN outputs the probability of each class. Note\nthat the probability of each class is the final text features ex-\ntracted from travel forum posts. The output represents the\nfluctuation of monthly tourism volume. Tourism volume\nmovement v\nt is described as follows:\nvt ¼ 0; cm /C20 cm/C0 1\n1; cm > cm/C0 1;\n/C26\nð1Þ\nwhere cm represents the tourism volume at month m.W h e n\ntourism volume increases from the previous month, vt is 1;\notherwise, vt is 0.\n3.2 Prediction models\n3.2.1 Temporal Fusion Transformers\nThe Google Cloud AI team ’s TFT model is a multi-horizon\ntime series prediction deep learning model that is naturally\ninterpretable [54] and has greater explanatory power than the\nstandard black-box model. TFT combines high-performance\nmultilevel forecasting with interpretable insights because mul-\ntilevel forecasting problems frequently have complicated in-\nputs, such as static covariates, known future inputs, and other\nexogenous time series that are only observed historically. Use\nsequence-to-sequence layers for local processing of known\nand observed inputs, a static covariate encoder to encode con-\ntext vectors, sample-dependent variable selection to reduce\nirrelevant inputs, and temporal self-attention that uses a de-\ncoder to understand any long-term dependencies in the\ndataset. Figure 3 depicts the model architecture of the TFT.\nTFT can effectively create feature representations for each\ninput type using canonical components, which enhances pre-\ndiction performance for a variety of prediction tasks.\nThe gating mechanism, variable selection network, static\ncovariate encoder, temporal processing, and multilevel predic-\ntion interval prediction are the five basic parts of the TFT.\na)Gating mechanism, which has the purpose of skipping over\nall architectural elements that are not in use while supplying\nadjustable depth and network complexity to adapt to various\ndatasets and circumstances; b)The variable selection network\nchooses the corresponding input variable at each time step; c)\nthe static covariate encoder integrates static features into the\nnetwork and constraints temporal dynamics by encoding con-\ntext vectors; d) Temporal processing, which involves the ac-\nquisition of long-term or short-term temporal associations\nfrom observations or known time-varying inputs. Sequence-\nto-sequence layers are utilized for local processing, whilst\nlong-term terms rely on a new interpretable multi-head atten-\ntion block capture; e) Multi-level prediction interval predic-\ntion utilizing quantile prediction to establish the range of prob-\nable target values inside each prediction interval. The com-\nplete details of TFT are provided in the reference [ 54].\n3.2.2 The proposed ADE-TFT model\nThe performance and accuracy of the TFT are significantly\ninfluenced by its characteristics. The task of choosing the ideal\nset of six hyperparameters is quite challenging. Thus, to fulfill\nthis work, a trustworthy and effective algorithm should be\nFig. 2 The model architecture of\nthe text CNN.\n14497Interpretable tourism demand forecasting with temporal fusion transformers amid COVID-19\napplied. Due to its effectiveness and simplicity, adaptive dif-\nferential evolution (ADE) is one of the best evolutionary op-\ntimization methods [ 55, 56]. Evolutionary optimization algo-\nrithms can search for a larger range of parameters than the\ncurrent neural network parameter tuning method, such as op-\ntimizing the input step size, which is not available in many\nparameters tuning methods. Therefore, in this work, the ideal\nTFT combination for the six hyperparameters is chosen using\nADE. The parameters that have been chosen include the num-\nber of time steps, learning rates, batch sizes, hidden layer\ncounts, consecutive hidden layer counts, and attention head\ncounts. Figure 4 depicts ADE-TFT. The following lists the\nspecifics of the optimization processes.\nStep 1: Data preparation, validation, and testing data make\nup the dataset.\nStep 2: Initializing ADE’s parameters and population. The\nfollowing parameters are set: population size ( NP),\nmaximum iteration number of ADE ( T), mutation\nfactor range ( F), crossover factor range ( CR), and\ngene range. According to the gene range, a random\npopulation is created.\nStep 3: Following the mutation, crossover, and selection op-\nerations, the population of the following generation\nis created.

All input variables (historical tourism volume\ndata, newly confirmed cases, Google Trends, number of posts,\nand CNN values) are linearly scaled to fit within the range\n[0.1, 0.9] to enhance forecasting performance and avoid po-\ntential numerical problems [ 57]. The ADE-TFT model and\nFig. 3 The model architecture of TFT\n14498 B. Wu et al.\nother comparable models were coded in Python 3.8. The com-\nputation was evaluated on an effective computer with an Intel\n(R) Core (TM) i7-10700 K CPU, 3.80 GHz, 32 GB RAM, and\nWindows 10 system. The CNN models and ADE-TFT models\nare available on GitHub ( https://github.com/wubinrong-hub/\nCNN-and-ADE-TFT-model).\n4.1 Data retrieval and preprocessing\nThe collection and preprocessing processes of tourism volume\ndata, newly confirmed cases, travel forum data, and Google\nTrends data are given as follows.\n(1) Tourism volume data\nBased on the number of international arrivals for the\nyear 2020 according to EUROSTAT ( https://ec.europa.\neu/eurostat/data/database), the top 3 European capitals\nare Paris, Amsterdam, and Lisbon. As shown in\nTable 1, the number of international arrivals in Paris is\nmeasured by arrivals in PARIS-CHARLES DE\nGAULLE airport and PARIS-ORLY airport. The num-\nber of international arrivals in Amsterdam and Lisbon is\nmeasured by arrivals in AMSTERDAM/SCHIPHOL\nairport and LISBOA airport, respectively. Figure 5\nshows the monthly international airport arrivals from\nJanuary 2012–to March 2022. In this graphic represen-\ntation, the tourism volume of the three European cities\npresents a cyclic pattern and an increasing trend before\n2020. However, since 2020, the tourism volume has\nchanged dramatically, esp ecially in March 2020 and\nApril 2020.\n(2) Monthly new confirmed cases\nThis study gathered information on new confirmed\ncases every month in France, Portugal, and the\nFig. 4 Flowchart of the ADE-\nTFT model\n14499Interpretable tourism demand forecasting with temporal fusion transformers amid COVID-19\nNetherlands from the World Health Organization ’so f f i -\ncial website ( https://covid19.who.int/), as the severity of\nthe COVID-19 outbreak in a tourist area influences the\ntraveler’s plans. The temporal series of foreign arrivals in\nParis, Amsterdam, and Lisbon as well as newly con-\nfirmed cases in France, the Netherlands, and Portugal\nare displayed in Fig. 6. These datasets are linearly scaled\nto match the range [0.1, 0.9] in order to clearly demon-\nstrate the association between these data. From Fig. 6,i t\nis intuitively clear that when the COVID-19 outbreak in\nthe area is severe, visitor numbers will fall sharply, and\nwhen the number of confirmed cases falls, visitor num-\nbers will sharply increase. Based on this, this analysis\nforecasts tourism demand while taking into account the\nnumber of new confirmed cases in the neighborhood to\nreflect the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic there.\n(3) Travel forum data\nInternet data could facilitate forecasting tourism vol-\nume to tourist destinations. TripAdvisor ( www.\ntripadvisor.com ), which is a leading travel guidance\nplatform, is a suitable candidate for analyzing traveler\nthoughts and interactions. With more than 884 million\nreviews and opinions about nearly 8 million businesses,\nTripAdvisor allows travelers to find accommodations,\nbook experiences, book a table at restaurants, and\ndiscover key attractions. The platform features an\nonline forum where people can exchange travel tips\nand opinions and share personal experiences that can\ninfluence the travel decisions of future travelers. As a\nwell-established travel recommendation platform with a\nsteady stream of posts, TripAdvisor can provide mass\nand high-quality data for our study.\nWe extracted two main types of data from the\nplatform, namely the number of posts and travel fo-\nrum text. The number of posts could reflect the pop-\nularity of a tourist destina tion. This number of posts\nis calculated by the sum of questions and responses\nin a specific forum, such as the Paris Travel Forum,\nAmsterdam Travel Forum, and Lisbon Travel Forum.\nThe travel forum text consists of the topic headline\nof a forum. As the headline states the core informa-\ntion of the post and the full post contains irrelevant\ninformation, we chose to analyze post headlines in\nthis research.\nTable 1 Top 3 European capital\ncities with the highest number of\ninternational arrivals in 2020\nCity Airport Period\nParis PARIS-CHARLES DE GAULLE airport\nPARIS-ORLY airport\nJan 2012- Mar 2022\nAmsterdam AMSTERDAM/SCHIPHOL airport Jan 2012- Mar 2022\nLisbon LISBOA airport Jan 2012- Mar 2022\nFig. 5 International airport\narrivals in Paris, Amsterdam, and\nLisbon\n14500 B. Wu et al.\nA total of 122,807 posts published from January\n2012 to March 2022 were collected from Paris\nForum, Amsterdam Forum, and Lisbon Forum. To\nfacilitate the measurement of semantic analysis, we\nonly collected posts writte ni nt h eE n g l i s hl a n g u a g e .\nAlthough the cities discussed in the study speaks\nFrench, Dutch, and Portuguese, more than 90% of\nthe posts on the three forums were in English. All\ntravel forum posts were combined according to\nmonth into a sample consisting of 123 observations.\n(4) Google Trends data\nGoogle Trends data were gathered from Google ’s\nsearch engine (Google Trends, http://www.google.com/\ntrends). The search behaviors of tourists when they look\nfor information about travel destinations to organize their\ntrips are recorded and constitute Google Trends. Search\nkeywords are designed according to the following steps:\na. LDA model was used to analyze the text in forum\ntravel posts (e.g., Paris Forum) and to divide these\nposts into several topics. These topics generally refer\nto major aspects of traveling such as lodging, shop-\nping, traffic, dining, recreation, and tour.\nb. We chose several topic words from each topic, which\ncan reflect the main characteristic of each topic, to\nform search keywords. The topic words, which are\nobtained by using LDA, reflect hot topics or tourist\ndestinations on the travel forum.\nc. Given those low-heat keywords are not reflected on\nGoogle Trends, the considered keywords were used to\nselect Google Trends and to check whether the corre-\nsponding search query volume data exist.\nd. Pearson correlation was employed to refine the data\nfrom Google Trends. Three Google Trends with the\nhighest Pearson correlation were determined as inputs\nto the prediction model.\n4.2 Forecasting procedure\nAll input variables were collected on a monthly basis.\nFigure 7 illustrates the training, validation, and testing pe-\nriods of the tourism volume forecasting model. The time\nspan of the CNN model covered the period from 2012:1 to\n2022:3. In the CNN model, the time span of the training\nperiod was from 2012:1 to 2017:8, including 68 monthly\nobservations. The test period was from 2017:9 to 2022:3,\nincluding 55 monthly observations. The output of the CNN\nmodel in the test period is employed as the input variables\nof the tourism volume forecasting model. In the tourism\nvolume forecasting model, the time span of training, vali-\ndation, and testing covered the periods 2017:9 to 2021:1,\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\nJan 2020 - Mar 2022\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nInternational arrivals of Paris\nNew confirmed cases in France\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\nJan 2020 - Mar 2022\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nInternational arrivals of Amsterdam\nNew confirmed cases in Netherland\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\nJan 2020 - Mar 2022\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nInternational arrivals of Lisbon\nNew confirmed cases in Portugal\nFig. 6 Time series of international arrivals and new confirmed cases\n14501Interpretable tourism demand forecasting with temporal fusion transformers amid COVID-19\n2021:2 to 2021:7, and 2021:8 to 2022:3, respectively. A\nrolling window was employed to estimate the tourism vol-\nume forecasting model.\n4.3 Text mining using the LDA topic model\nThe topic of travel-related forum postings was examined\nusing the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model\n[58]. Tables 2 and 3 show, respectively, the fuzziness and\ncoherence of subject numbers ranging from 3 to 8. The\nLDA model ’s prediction accuracy is measured by the per-\nplexity evaluation metric, and topic quality is gauged by\nthe coherence evaluation metric. So confusion and coher-\nence are combined to determine the topic numbers. Both\nperplexity and coherence suggest that the ideal number of\ntopics for the Paris dataset should be 5, whereas the ideal\nnumber for the Lisbon dataset should be 3. In contrast, the\nperplexity and coherence suggest different topic counts\nfor the Amsterdam datasets. The optimal number of topics\nin the Amsterdam dataset is 3, as there is little difference\nin perplexity between the number of topics of 3, 4, and 5,\nbut there is a significant difference in coherence; there-\nfore, we choose the smallest coherence. As shown above,\nthe findings imply that 5, 3, and 4 are the ideal topic\nnumbers for Paris, Amsterdam, and Lisbon. As a result,\nthere are primarily 5, 3, and 4 subjects in each post in the\nParis, Amsterdam, and Lisbon forums, respectively.\nBased on the statistical inferences obtained by using\nLDA, Table 4 depicts their topic and word distributions.\nThe 20 topic words in each topic are identified by the\nlargest weightings (i.e., term frequency-inverse document\nfrequency, TF– IDF). These topic words reflect hot topics\nin the forum and impact factors of tourism arrivals. The\nfollowing analysis takes the Paris dataset as an example.\nTopic 1 mainly represents words related to transportation,\nfor example, “cdg,”“ train,”“ metro, ”“ airport, ” and\n“gare.” The words “restaurant,”“ location,”“ apartment,”\n“hotel,” and “credit” in topic 2 may suggest questions\nabout Paris lodging and dining. Furthermore, Topic 3\nmay reflect family trips according to specific words such\nas “Disneyland, ”“ kid,” and “honeymoon. ” In addition,\n“transfer, ”“ cdg,” and “flying” in topic 4 may suggest\ndiscussions about tourist flight connections. Topic 5 may\nreflect discussions about tourist attractions ( “Eiffel,”“ itin-\nerary,”“ museum”,a n d“ Louvre”) and recreation ( “itiner-\nary” and “cru\n ise”). These topics are extracted by using\nLDA models and contain qualitative information that is\ndifficult to reflect using statistical indicators. Analyzing\ntopics discussed in travel forums in different periods\nmay facilitate tourism volume forecasting.\n4.4 Extracting text features with CNN classification\nThe CNN classification was used to extract text features\nfrom travel forum posts. The hyperparameter combination\nof CNN was selected by the grid search method. After\nseveral parameter experiments, Table 5 depicts the final\nCNN parameters of the Paris, Amsterdam, and Lisbon\ndatasets, respectively. Table 6 shows the results of the\nCNN model. CNN classification has achieved satisfactory\nperformance in all three data sets.\nFigure 8 shows the time series of international arrivals,\nthe number of posts, and CNN classifications. The\nFig. 7 Training, validation, and\ntesting periods of tourism volume\nforecasting model\nTable 2 The perplexity of different topic numbers\nNumber of topics Paris Amsterdam Lisbon\n3 856.12 743.62 589.53\n48 5 5 . 8 4 740.69 585.98\n5 850.39 743.93 589.90\n6 856.33 746.75 586.72\n7 860.11 749.42 588.85\n8 858.67 751.77 595.80\nThe lower the perplexity, the higher the LDA model prediction accuracy\nTable 3 The coherence of different topic numbers\nNumber of topics Paris Amsterdam Lisbon\n3 -6.51 -8.24 -11.96\n4 -7.41 -10.19 -11.03\n5 -6.09 -9.88 -11.32\n6 -8.90 -11.40 -12.47\n7 -9.03 -11.35 -12.85\n8 -9.98 -12.65 -12.64\nThe higher the consistency, the higher the topic quality obtained by the\nLDA model\n14502 B. Wu et al.\nnumber of posts and CNN values show similar trends in\nterms of tourism volume, either contemporarily or with a\nslight lag. The fluctuation of CNN values can be used as\nan indicator of the increase or decline of tourist volume.\nMoreover, the number of posts and Google Trends can\nsuggest the amplitude of tourism demand fluctuation, ei-\nther increase or decline. Thus, combining CNN values,\nthe number of posts, and Google Trends is a scientific\napproach when forecasting precise tourism volume.\n4.5 Google Trends selection by topic words\nAs shown in Table 7, the topic words in bold are selected to\ndetermine Google Trends. These topic words, which can re-\nflect the main characteristic of each topic, are used to form\nsearch keywords. For example, the words “train,”“ metro,”\nand “airport” from topic 1 in the Paris Forum reflect discus-\nsions about transportation, similar to the theme of topic 1.\nHowever, the words “stay,”“ recommendation,” and “advice”\nTable 4 Topic words in forum posts\nCity Type Number of posts Top 20 topic words\nParis (A total of 80,720 posts) Topic 1 17,396 (21.55%) Hotel, stay, cdg, train, metro, Paris, airport, gare, advice, Nord, recommendation,\nApril, Orly, car, transportation, Lyon, Easter, lunch, shop,n i g h t l i f e\nTopic 2 7676 (9.51%) Apartment, restaurant, rental, travel, location, Paris, visit, June, hotel,G e r m a n ,\nbirthday, September, company, experience, centre, finding, credit, refund, tax\nTopic 3 6710 (8.31%) Tour, France, dinner, Montparnasse,a i r ,n i c e ,P a r i s ,Disneyland, private, view,\nwalking, tourist, free, fare, parking, honeymoon, visitor, hotel, guided, kid\nTopic 4 21,037 (26.06%) Paris, trip, day, taxi, Marais, station, transfer, 1st, flying, French, cdg, card, report,\nquick, central, food, buying, hotel, Halle, dining\nTopic 5 27,900 (34.56%) Question, Eiffel, tower, itinerary, ticket, pas, bus, museum, louvre,b u y ,Chales,\nGaulle, Paris, book, cruise, flight, Moulin, airport, Saint, hotel\nAmsterdam (A total of 27,444 posts) Topic 1 5421 (19.75%) Hotel, restaurant, Amsterdam, bus,l a y o v e r ,travel,t r a m ,Paris,h o u r ,airport,\nday, recommendation, shop, walking, family, food, train, coffee, Indonesian,\ntour\nTopic 2 9329 (33.99%) Amsterdam, trip, Keukenhof, tour, stay, canal, city, central, cruise,c a r d , tulip,\nSchipol, visit, Brussels, bar, accommodation, rental, car, bike, Easter\nTopic 3 12,694 (46.25%) Train, question, airport, ticket, Schipol, night, Amsterdam, museum, station,\ntransfer, house, hotel, suggestion, location, frank, Anne, Bruges, April, day,\nwindmill\nLisbon (A total of 14,643 posts) Topic 1 1525 (10.41%) Train, Portugal, travel, station, weather, ticket, Lisbon, cost, June, local, luggage,\nprice, purchase, advance, activity, passport, dining,b i k e ,E n g l i s h ,C O V I D - 1 9\nTopic 2 2625 (17.93%) Trip, stay, restaurant, question, Lisbon, Sintra, fado, apartment, beach,a d v i c e ,\ncruise, traveling, flight, family, football, connection, July, Portugal, report,\nairport\nTopic 3 4927 (33.65%) Lisbon, car, day, Porto, rental, transport,n i g h t ,tour, Cascais, faro, train, airport,\npublic, visit, Benfica, weekend, stay, food, bar, Easter\nTopic 4 5566 (38.01%) Hotel, airport, taxi, bus, Lisbon, card, metro, hour, suggestion, recommendation,\ntransfer, layover, transportation, Lagos, free, Oriente, market, stopover, map,\nbreakfast\nThe words in bold are selected to determine Google Trends.

The keywords of each topic are selected and\nshown in Table 7. Given that a topic word is a single word, we\nhave supplemented it with the name of the travel destination\nor the special meaning of tourism. For example, “tour” from\nthe Paris Forum denotes the keywords of the Paris tour, and\n“Eiffel” clearly suggests the keywords of The Eiffel Tower.\nTable 8 summarizes the Pearson correlation of the selected\nGoogle Trends with the tourism volumes of Paris,\nAmsterdam, and Lisbon. Three Google Trends with the\nhighest Pearson correlation for each dataset are determined.\nThus, the keywords “Paris museum,”“ Paris flight,” and “Paris\nairport” are determined as the final Google Trends of the Paris\ndataset. The keywords “Amsterdam station, ”“ Amsterdam\ntour, ” and “Amsterdam food, ” are selected as the final\nGoogle Trends of the Amsterdam dataset. The keywords\n“Lisbon restaurant,”“ Lisbon airport,” and “Lisbon,” are se-\nlected as the inputs of the Lisbon tourism volume forecasting.\nFigure 9 shows the time series of international arrivals and\nthese Google Trends. Google Trends show very similar trends\nin international arrivals, either contemporarily or with a slight\nlag. This finding suggests that Google Trends could be a sat-\nisfactory predictor of tourist arrivals.\n4.6 Tourism volume forecasting\n(a) Performance measures\nA percentage error and two scale-dependent errors,\nnamely MAPE, RMSE, and MAE, are employed to eval-\nuate the accuracy of tourism volume forecasting.

Wu et al.\nutilized in this work to forecast tourism volume as com-\nparative models [59–64]. These forecasting models used\nmonthly tourist volume as an output variable and histor-\nical tourism volume data, newly confirmed cases, and\nbig data indices (such as Google Trends and travel forum\ndata) as input variables. One-step-ahead prediction is\nused by all prediction models.\n(iii) Parameter set\nThe grid search method was applied to select the\nparameters of ADE. The parameters of the ADE-\nTFT model in the three data sets are listed in\nTable 9. The search range of TFT parameters is as\nfollows: the range of the number of batch sizes is set\nwithin [5,20]; the number of attention heads, [1,4];\nthe number of hidden layers, [2,8]; the number of\nconsecutive hidden layers [2,8]; the number of time\nsteps, [2,12]; learning rates, [0.001,0.1]. The final\nparameters of ADE-TFT are shown in Table 9.W i t h\nParis dataset as an example, Table 10 shows the\ninput variables of the TFT model.\nThe grid search method is applied to determine\nthe parameters of the comparable models.\nAccording to the results of a series of experiments,\nTable 11 presents the final parameter values of com-\nparable models in all examples.\n(iv) Results and discussion\nThe prediction performance of ADE-TFT\nis superior to that of BPNN, ARIMAX,\nSARIMAX, SVM, and LSTM, according to\nthe results of the predictions provided in\nTable 12. This is because ADE-TFT has a\ngood capacity to fit data with complicated\nfluctuations. Additionally, this study\ncontrasted the ADE-TFT model with the fun-\ndamental genetic algorithm (GA) and the dif-\nferential evolution algorithm (DE) to improve\nthe TFT model in order to assess the ADE\nalgorithm’s capacity for optimization. The\nfindings demonstrate that the ADE algorithm\nis a superior way for determining appropriate\nparameters for the TFT model, as the ADE-\nTFT model predicts outcomes better than the\nDE-TFT model and the GA-TFT model do in\nthe majority of circumstances. The prediction\nperformances of various models are displayed\nin Fig. 10. The expected tourism volume in\nthe graphic was forecasted using ADE-TFT\nmodels, which is closer to the actual tourism\nvolume than it was predicted using other com-\nparable models. This result implies that the\nADF-TFT model is a reliable forecasting\nmodel for tourism demand.\nThe predicting performances of various\nforecasting models using various predictors\nare shown in Table 13. Due to the impact of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, tourism volume\nhas fluctuated sharply in recent years, so only\nusing historical tourism volume to forecast\ntourism has achieved poor results as shown\nin Table 13. Whereas, when new confirmed\ncases are considered in the tourism volume\nprediction, the results will be significantly im-\nproved. In the majority of situations, combin-\ning historical tourism volume, fresh evidence\nof popular tourist destinations, Google\nTrends, the volume of posts, and CNN text\ncharacteristics can improve prediction perfor-\nmance compared to utilizing fewer factors in\nprojecting tourism volume in Paris,\nAmsterdam, and Lisbon. Utilizing the Paris\ndatasets as an example, the MAPE of the sug-\ngested model increased from 7.37 to 3.10%\nwhen compared to using only historical tour-\nism volume, new confirmed cases of tourist\nTable 9 Parameters of the ADE-\nTFT in the three data sets Parameter Paris Amsterdam Lisbon\nADE Population size ( M )1 5 20 2 0\nMaximum number of iterations ( T )3 0 3 0 3 5\nCrossover probability (CR) 0.2 0.3 0.2\nMutation operator (F) [0,1] [0,1] [0,1]\nTFT Number of time steps 5 5 4\nNumber of batch sizes 16 18 15\nLearning rates 0.072 0.048 0.069\nNumber of hidden layers 8 6 8\nNumber of attention heads 1 1 1\nNumber of consecutive hidden layers 4 4 4\n14507Interpretable tourism demand forecasting with temporal fusion transformers amid COVID-19\ndestinations, and Google Trends. The out-\ncomes show that multisource big data is pref-\nerable for predicting tourism volume over the\nCOVID-19 period.\n(c) Interpretable results and analysis\nThe interpretable outcomes of the ADE-TFT model\nare shown in Figs. 11, 12 and 13. The following expla-\nnation is broken up into three sections: the attention of\nvarious lag orders, the importance order of previous in-\nputs, and the importance order of future variables. The\nfollowing is a thorough study of the results that can be\nunderstood:\n& When evaluating the significance of historical in-\nputs, it was discovered that Google Trends, CNN\nfeatures, the number of postings, and monthly\nnew confirmed instances were the most beneficial\nfor travel forecasts. The higher contribution of the\nmonthly new confirmed cases to the tourism pre-\ndiction suggests that the epidemic condition and\nthe policies of tourist destinations for preventing\nepidemics have emerged as the primary concerns\nand barriers to travel. As seen in Figs. 11, 12 and\n13, the interpretable results indicate that CNN\nvalues and the number of posts have significant\nexplanatory power for estimating tourism volume\nin the majority of situations. In other words, in-\nformation from travel forums can contribute to\nprojecting tourism volume in additional ways.\n& According to the relevance of known variables, the\nyear is more useful to the forecast of tourism demand\nthan the month, showing that the COVID-19 pandem-\nic has significantly affected travel demand since 2020.\n& The overall tendency of attention shifts is that the\ninput variables contribute more to the forecast of\nTable 11 Parameters of the\ndifferent comparable models Model and Variable Adopted parameters\nBPNN(Paris) hidden neurons=4; learning rate=0.005; epochs=200\nBPNN(Amsterdam) hidden neurons=4; learning rate=0.005; epochs=250\nBPNN(Lisbon) hidden neurons=5; learning rate=0.005; epochs=300\nARIMAX(Paris) p, d, q= (2,0,1)\nARIMAX(Amsterdam) p, d, q= (1,0,1)\nARIMAX(Lisbon) p, d, q= (1,0,0)\nSARIMAX(Paris) p, d, q= (1,0,1); P, D, Q = (0,0,1)\nSARIMAX(Amsterdam) p, d, q= (0,0,1); P, D, Q = (1,0,1)\nSARIMAX(Lisbon) p, d, q= (2,0,1); P, D, Q = (1,0,1)\nSVM(Paris) kernel = “rbf”; gamma=0.1.; C=3.1\nSVM(Amsterdam) kernel = “rbf”; gamma=0.24; C=2.2\nSVM(Lisbon) kernel = “rbf”; gamma=0.03; C=3.2\nLSTM(Paris) batch size=22; hidden neurons=15; epochs=300\nLSTM(Amsterdam) batch size=23; hidden neurons=20; epochs=350\nLSTM (Lisbon) batch size=25; hidden neurons=25; epochs=300\nTable 10 Inputs of the ADE-TFT\nin the Paris dataset Static covariates Past inputs Known future inputs\nID (name of tourism volume series) GT of Paris airport Year\n- GT of Paris museum Month\n- GT of Paris flight Time index\n- CNN values Relative time index\n- Number of posts -\n- Historical tourism arrivals data -\n- Monthly new confirmed cases -\n-Y e a r -\n- Month -\nTime index\nRelative time index\n14508 B.

For in-\nstance, the attention value with a lag order of five\nin the Paris sample is 23.5%, occupying a greater\ncomponent. Determining the optimal lag sequence\nis crucial since this necessitates that the predictive\nmodel has the memory capacity to retrieve long-\nterm inputs, which also supports the need for\nemploying ADE to optimize the TFT parameters\nsuggested in this study.\n4.7 Managerial implications\nFrom February 2020 to April 2020, several major airports\nworldwide were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and\ntravel bans in most countries. For example, international air-\nport arrivals in Paris, Amsterdam, and Lisbon represent a total\nreduction of 97.86%, 96.98%, and 98.78%, respectively. With\nthe reopening policy released in the middle of 2020, the tour-\nism volume in Europe slightly recovered. Since then, forecast-\ning tourism demand has become challenging.

In particular, Google Trends and the\nquantity of postings might indicate how popular a desti-\nnation is for tourists, and travel forums ’ content often\nincludes evaluations of the relevant restrictions or\nreopening rules as well as discussions of tourist interests\nat various times. In the meanwhile, the recently verified\ncases can provide insight into the epidemic situation in\npopular tourist areas, which is particularly useful for\npredicting visitation in the post-epidemic future.\n(b) Managers in the tourism business will benefit from the\ninterpretable result of the tourism volume prediction.\nStakeholders can have a deeper knowledge of the con-\nnections between Google Trends, travel forum posts, and\ntourism volume volumes. The subjects and attitudes of\nvisitors toward popular tourist sites are reflected in travel\nforum data, which can be utilized to determine whether\nor not tourists have future trip plans. The number of\nsearches for a particular destination is shown by\nGoogle Trends.

In addition,\nthey can further develop revenue management objectives\nby appropriate staff scheduling and applying dynamic\npricing strategies. Moreover, authorities can use tourism\nvolume forecasts to support crowd management and bet-\nter guard against COVID-19.\n5 Conclusion and future research\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, tourism demand in well-\nknown tourist cities exhibits violently fluctuating trends, mak-\ning it difficult to predict with accuracy. This research forecasts\ntourist demand by combining historical travel volume, month-\nly new confirmed cases of travel destinations, Google Trends,\nand travel forum data from TripAdvisor. Google Trends and\ntravel forum data complement one another; Google Trends\nshows the popularity of tourist destinations, while travel fo-\nrum data reveals the many themes that travelers are interested\nin at various times. As a result, this approach to projecting\ntourism volume may produce adequate results. LDA, deep\nlearning techniques and an interpretable forecasting model\nare combined to propose a comprehensive framework for an-\nticipating tourism demand. In particular, Google Trends are\nchosen for each topic after LDA analyzes the topics in the\ntravel forum text. From the travel forum posts, CNN is used\nto automatically extract text features. In the meantime, the\nrevolutionary deep model ADE-TFT is suggested to forecast\nthe volume of tourism.\nThe study makes a variety of contributions. To start, this\nstudy suggests a brand-new interpretable forecasting model,\ncalled ADE-TFT, that can better estimate tourism demand\nand explain the function of in put variables. The TFT model’ s\nperformance is enhanced by using the ADE algorithm to opti-\nmize the parameter combination. Decision-makers involved in\nthe tourism industry can benefit from interpretable analysis of\nforecasted tourist demand since it can help them create more\nreliable predictions and plans. Second, this study provides a\nnovel approach to choose keywords from search engine data\nand introduces two new predictive elements, namely text qual-\nities of travel forum content and the number of posts. This study\nrepresents the first attempt t o choose Google Trends based on\nthe generated themes using the LDA model. These results con-\ntribute to a broader understanding of the theoretical underpin-\nnings of method prediction, which may make it easier to predict\nthe fluctuating demand for tr avel during the COVID-19 pan-\ndemic using data from Google Trends and travel forums.\nHowever, there are gaps in this study that demand more\nresearch. In the first place, usin g complete posts and complete\nanswers to postings rather than just post titles could have more\nmanagement consequences. Second, the number of languages\nand sources can increase the size of the travel forum material\n(e.g., Twitter, blogs, and news) [65]. Third, choosing keywords\nis entirely manual. Fourth, the study’ st i m ef r a m ew a sb r o a d ,\nspanning from January 2012 through March 2022. To make it\nsimpler for textual categorization algorithms to understand what\npassengers have been interested in since the COVID-19 out-\nbreak, periods can be cut down and daily or weekly data can\nbe used. For the purpose of reaching a more significant and\napplicable conclusion, additional research is required.\nAcknowledgements The authors are very grateful for the constructive\ncomments of editors and referees.
