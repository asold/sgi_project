    "abstract": "The paper presents developed measuring system for evaluation of the transformation accuracy of harmonics of distorted voltage by medium voltage instrument transformers. Manual feedback loop is successfully used for control of the RMS values and phases of harmonics of the distorted input voltage of the step-up voltage transformer. It ensures required waveform of the output voltage and safe operation of the measuring system. Analyzed sources of the resonance phenomenon in the supplying transformer include the influence of its load. It has been shown that this does not cause limitation of the frequency range of operation of the measuring system. The measurement uncertainty of values of voltage ratio error and phase displacement by developed measuring system is discussed in detail. Its decrease may be obtained by usage of the measurement of the differential voltage.",
