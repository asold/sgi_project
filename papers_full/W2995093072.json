INTRODUCTION\nTransformers are among the most important equipment in an\nelectrical power network. Their performance has a noticeable\neffect on the reliability of the power network. Operating in\nvariable temperatures and loading conditions, transformers\nare expected to serve successfully for the full theoretical\ndesigned life. Oil/paper insulation plays a vital role in deter-\nmining transformers’ performance and life. The insulation\nsystem in a transformer is a composite insulating medium\ncomposed of oil and paper. Insulating oil is expected to serve\nas an insulant, coolant, protective barrier for the core, and\ndiagnostic medium for the transformer.\nA wide range of liquid dielectrics are available nat-\nurally or synthesized chemically and then pre-processed\nfor application in transformer insulation technology [1].\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Boxue Du\n.\nLiquid dielectrics are classiﬁed into organic and inorganic\nchemical compounds [2]. Organic compounds may be natural\nor agricultural oils such as soybean oils, coconut oils, etc.,\nwhich are fatty acids generated in seeds and ﬂowers [3, 4].\nThese agricultural oils are ester compounds and are generally\nreferred to as natural esters. Inorganic compounds are chemi-\ncally developed or synthesized; these include mineral oils, sil-\nicone oils, synthetic liquids, nanoﬂuids, and mixed insulating\nﬂuids. Mineral insulating oils are hydrocarbons derived from\ncrude petroleum while silicone oils are halogen-free synthetic\ncompounds that are products of polymerization [5]. Syn-\nthetic liquids are chemically formed substitutes for hydrocar-\nbons such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and synthetic\nesters. To date, research on insulating oils for transformers\nhas gone through several critical stages and the shortfalls and\nadvantages of various insulating ﬂuids have been reported.\nA detailed report on the progress of insulating oils over\n50 years was published in 2013 in [1].\n184552 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Mohan Raoet al.: Alternative Dielectric Fluids for Transformer Insulation System: Progress, Challenges, and Future Scope\nFIGURE 1. Timeline: Development of transformer insulating fluids.\nIn the recent past, ester-based dielectric ﬂuids, both nat-\nural and synthetic, have gained considerable popularity\namong global research communities and industries interested\nin liquid dielectrics. In particular, the biodegradability of\nester-based dielectric ﬂuids is an important characteristic.\nHence, there is real scope and demand to improve the exist-\ning knowledge and literature on these new insulating ﬂuids.\nThis article seeks to summarize potential and contemporary\nissues concerning ester dielectric ﬂuids. It will emphasize the\naspects that are of key concern to researchers and industry.\nAfter a critical survey, the authors identiﬁed the aspects of\nthe usage of ester ﬂuids in transformers listed below, which\nshould be further investigated.\n• The miscibility and retroﬁlling aspects of the new insu-\nlating oils.\n• The workability of ester ﬂuids in regions with cold\nclimates.\n• The application of ester ﬂuids in on-load tap changers\n(OLTCs).\n• Pre-breakdown phenomena of ester ﬂuids and the effect\nof insulation age on streamer behavior.\n• Environmental performance and ﬁre-related aspects.\nThe citations considered in this study provide technical data\nrelevant in testing the hypothesis that ester ﬂuids can be\napplied in transformers. The above-mentioned factors were\nfound to have signiﬁcant potential for future research and\nshould help improve knowledge of the application of ester\nﬂuids. This study provides information on the performance of\nvarious insulation oils in the development of oil-ﬁlled trans-\nformers since their inception. The disadvantages of tradi-\ntional mineral oils that highlight the need for alternatives are\ndiscussed. The contemporary research scenarios pertaining to\nester dielectric ﬂuids and challenges in using them to replace\nmineral oils are also addressed. Recent research progress on\nmixed insulating ﬂuids versus mineral oils and ester ﬂuids\nis reported. In addition, a detailed state-of-the-art review and\npotential future scope for all the individual issues identiﬁed\nabove are provided.\nII. EVOLUTION OF TRANSFORMER INSULATION OILS\nOver the years, various kinds of insulating ﬂuids have been\nused in transformers to cater to regular industry needs and\nrespect environmental regulations. The evolution of liquid\ndielectrics from the beginning of transformer technology to\nthe present state is summarized in Figure 1.\nFrom the inception of oil-ﬁlled transformers, mineral insu-\nlating oils (derivatives of crude petroleum) were adopted for\ninsulation and cooling purposes. Mineral oils are extracted\nfrom either parafﬁn or naphthenic-based crude oils. Until\n1925, parafﬁn-based mineral insulating oils were used; they\nwere replaced by naphthenic-based ones because of the\nhigh pour point of the parafﬁn-based oils [6]. Although\nmineral oils were used predominantly, their low ﬁre resis-\ntance caused problems and led the industry to search for an\nalternative.\nIn 1930, PCBs were found to have high ﬁre resistance and\nbetter dielectric properties than mineral oil. Until the 1960s,\nPCB was used as a transformer insulating ﬂuid. However,\nenvironmental issues were raised [7], and in the 1970s, the\npublic started to oppose their use, as new discoveries led to\nclaims that PCBs were extremely toxic organic environmental\npollutants [8]. It was then revealed that PCBs have dangerous\nemission proﬁles in certain combustion conditions. In 1978,\nthe regulatory commissions outlawed the use of PCBs due\nto their toxicity [9]. This increased industry’s desire for\neco-friendly insulating ﬂuids. In the 1980s, industry started\nto search for new alternative insulating ﬂuids. Furthermore,\nin 2009, equipment containing PCBs higher than a set value\nwas incinerated in some parts of Europe [1].\nMeanwhile, high-temperature hydrocarbons (HTH) were\nfound to have good thermal performance but their high vis-\ncosity called for major changes in cooling system design,\nwhich reduced industry’s interest [5]. In 1970, silicon oils\nVOLUME 7, 2019 184553\nU. Mohan Raoet al.: Alternative Dielectric Fluids for Transformer Insulation System: Progress, Challenges, and Future Scope\nwere introduced to replace PCBs due to their good thermal\nperformance and nontoxicity, but their high cost limited use\nto some special transformer applications [10].\nSynthetic esters, which are synthesized from alcohols and\nacids, were introduced by researchers during the 1990s [11].\nSynthetic esters were found to have high dielectric strength;\nthey are biodegradable, less viscous, and have a higher ﬁre\npoint [8]. At the same time, due to strict environmental regu-\nlations and the global interest in green technologies and sus-\ntainable fuels, researchers started studying vegetable oils and\nnatural esters in the 1990s [11]. In 1999 and 2001, three com-\nmercial products were patented for use in transformers based\non different vegetable oils (sunﬂower oil, canola oil, soybean\noil) [12]–[14]. It was reported that natural esters’ oxidation\nstability is low and their application was initially restricted to\nsealed transformers. Later, efforts were made to improve their\noxidation stability by using suitable nanoparticles [15]. Inves-\ntigations of the characteristics and performance of blended\ninsulating ﬂuids are reported in [16], [17]. In 2006, it was\nconﬁrmed that a mixture of 80% mineral oil and 20% syn-\nthetic ester improves insulating systems’ operating perfor-\nmance [18]. In 2008 and 2012, palm fatty acid ester (PFAE)\noils were proposed because of their low viscosity and high\nrelative permittivity. Further, ester oil’s physical properties\nand loading/cooling capabilities were modiﬁed by dispersing\nnanoparticles [19], [20]. At the same time, several agricultural\noils were investigated worldwide to study their feasibility\nfor application in transformers. It was recently reported that\nan 80:20 mixture ratio of mineral oil and synthetic esters is\noptimal for application in transformers [21], [22].\nIII. NEED FOR ALTERNATIVE INSULATING FLUIDS\nConventionally, cooling and insulation for transformer tech-\nnology have been done by mineral oil originating in crude\noil. In view of the expected future oil crisis, the cost of crude\noil is increasing, and thus the availability of crude oil stocks\nwill be questionable [1]. Although the dielectric properties\nof mineral oils are widely accepted, the demand for high\ninsulating levels requires higher dielectric performance, par-\nticularly dielectric breakdown strength [5]. The typical value\nof breakdown voltage for fresh mineral oil is around 50 kV\n(according to manufacturers). The demand for higher voltage\nlevels is increasing daily; eventually it becomes problematic\nfor the insulating medium to provide effective insulation and\ncope with higher temperatures. Also, in the event of arcing or\nshort circuits, the rise in temperatures must be withstood by\nthe insulating oil. This particular situation creates a need for\nhigh ﬂash points and ﬁre points in insulating oils. The typical\nvalue of the ﬂash point for new mineral oil is in the range\nof 180 ◦C to 220 ◦C, according to the manufacturers [21].\nTransformer insulation systems should not be allowed to\ninteract with moisture and environmental air, but moisture is\nunavoidable. For sealed transformers, moisture is created by\ncellulose insulation paper; for non-sealed units, it is emitted\nby cellulose and also enters from the external environment\nthe through breather conﬁguration. The rate of hydrolysis\nis higher in mineral oil than in ester ﬂuids, leading to the\ngeneration of acids, furanic compounds and carbon dioxide in\noil. Similarly, oxygen ingress works with gases liberated from\ninsulation paper due to temperature and expedites oxidation.\nOxidation involves the generation of acids and water in oil.\nThis water expedites hydrolysis and hampers the polymer-\nization of cellulose papers [23]. The severity of oxidation\nand hydrolysis in mineral oils tends to increase sludging and\ninduce catastrophic failures and premature aging of trans-\nformers if the oil is not properly maintained by reclaiming it\nwhen required. If oil spills or is disposed of in water bodies,\nthe chemistry of mineral oils affects the environment more\npermanently than biodegradable liquids.\nHigh operational temperatures in transformers may lead\nto ﬁres, creating an element of risk for the operating per-\nsonnel and surrounding equipment. This may also result in\nlarge ﬁnancial loss and poor asset management and risk\nassessment. Considering these disadvantages of mineral oils,\nindustries should plan for high budgets and invest in good\ninsurance plans to cover any loss incurred. These issues\nwith mineral oils have compelled industry to seek an alter-\nnative for use in oil-ﬁlled transformers. The challenge is\nto identify appropriate alternatives that have good dielectric\nand thermal properties and are biodegradable and nontoxic\nwith good chemical stability. The new insulating oils must\nalso prove their compatibility with other materials that are\nused in transformers and satisfy environmental and safety\nregulations. Importantly, the alternatives must also exhibit an\noptimal balance between initial investments and maintenance\ncosts. In several experimental studies around the world, one\npossible alternative for mineral oils has been found to be\nester-based oils. The properties of mineral oil and ester ﬂuids\nare presented in Table 1.\nIV. RESEARCH PROGRESS ON ESTER DIELECTRIC FLUIDS\nSince the 1990s, numerous studies have reported on the per-\nformance of the new insulating ﬂuids in comparison to min-\neral oils. Most researchers support the use of these new oils\nas potential replacements for mineral oil. The research out-\ncomes and performance of these new oils have been reviewed.\nSigniﬁcant review reports surveying the use of natural and\nsynthetic esters in comparison to mineral oils are summarized\nin Table 2.\nA. PERFORMANCE OF ESTER FLUIDS: RECENT PROGRESS\nMost research into alternative dielectric ﬂuids has focused\non investigating aging performance, degradation aspects, and\naging markers in comparison to mineral oil. It is established\nin the literature that esters are potential candidates for appli-\ncations in oil-ﬁlled transformers. However, industry hesitates\nto use these new insulating ﬂuids, because of the unavailabil-\nity of dedicated condition-monitoring methodologies and a\nlack of information on pre-discharge events and breakdown\nphenomena, and retroﬁlling and miscibility of these new\noils. Furthermore, the performance of these new oils in cold\nclimates has not yet been examined in the literature.\n184554 VOLUME 7, 2019\nU.

Vegetable oils have proven to have high break-\ndown voltage and good dielectric properties. The higher rate\nof oxidation in ester ﬂuids is a major concern, which is\nquantiﬁed using the area under the absorbance spectral curves\nof ultraviolet-visible infrared spectroscopy. In the recent past,\nvarious researchers emphasized different plant-based natu-\nral esters, while some authors continued the investigation\nof natural esters in comparison to mineral and synthetic\nesters. PFAEs have become one of the popular plant-based\noils in the ﬁeld of alternative oils [28]. The feasibility of\npalm-based neopentyl glycol diester for use in a transformer\nwas investigated and reported in [29]. Properties such as\nﬂash point, pour point, viscosity, dielectric strength, acid-\nity and moisture were analyzed in comparison to mineral\noil and natural esters. It was reported that high-molecular-\nweight aging products, produced with aging in esters, are\nresponsible for increased viscosity. The acidity of palm-based\nneopentyl glycol diester is lower than that of natural esters,\nwhich also proves the potential hydrolytic stability of this new\noil.\nTokunaga et al. investigated the performance and esti-\nmated service life of solid insulation in PFAE-ﬁlled trans-\nformers [30]–[32]. They claimed that the lifetime of solid\ninsulation in PFAE is 7.3 times higher than in mineral oil. The\ndeterioration rate of paper impregnated and aged in mineral\noil was observed to be almost 4 times higher than that of paper\nin PFAE. Research on natural-ester-ﬁlled transformers indi-\ncates that evidence of carbon dioxide is the potential aging\nmarker for solid insulation in nitrogen-sealed natural-ester-\nﬁlled transformers. Investigations of the key properties of Jat-\nropha curcas oil as a dielectric liquid are reported in [33]. The\nimpact of esteriﬁcation on the properties of Jatropha curcas\noil is also discussed and it was observed that, after esteriﬁca-\ntion (alkali base catalyzed), this oil could also be a substitute\nfor mineral oils. Similarly, performance analyses of Karanja\noil [34], edible oils [35], [36], camellia and rapeseed oils [37],\nand waste vegetable oil [38] have been reported recently, and\nthe superiority of vegetable oils over mineral oils and their\nfeasibility for use in transformers were highlighted. Condi-\ntion monitoring information of in-service vegetable oils is\nimportant information to industry and a real-time monitoring\nhistory for a service period of 10 years with vegetable-oil-\nﬁlled transformers is documented in [39]. These condition\nmonitoring data include signiﬁcant parameters such as dis-\nsipation factor, interfacial tension, acid number, water in oil,\ndielectric strength, and dissolved gas analysis. It was found\nthat natural esters generate similar traces of dissolved gas\nto mineral oils but with a higher concentration of ethane.\n184556 VOLUME 7, 2019\nU. Mohan Raoet al.: Alternative Dielectric Fluids for Transformer Insulation System: Progress, Challenges, and Future Scope\nIn addition, the sealing of a natural-ester-ﬁlled transformer\nmust be maintained effectively in order to sustain longer\nservice periods.\nNatural esters are attracting attention across the industry,\nand several utilities have started using natural esters for\nsealed transformers due to their characteristics (renewability,\nbiodegradability, availability and safety) [40]. The perfor-\nmance of natural esters in sealed transformers is good; it\nis questionable in breather transformers because of the high\noxidation rate. However, researchers have worked to under-\nstand and improve the oxidation stability of natural esters.\nVarious antioxidants were considered in different proportions\nand the effects on aging markers were reported. Different\noil properties have been correlated with different particle\nvolume fractions of antioxidants to track the properties of\noils with various proportions of antioxidants. The addition\nof more antioxidants to natural esters appears to reduce the\ndielectric properties of the oil [41]. Propyl gallate and citric\nacid were also investigated for use as oxidation inhibitors\nin natural esters and the inﬂuence of these inhibitors on oil\nperformance is reported in [42]. Oil oxidation induction time\nand discharge inception voltage have been studied to evaluate\nthe impact of oxidation stability and breakdown voltage on\npartial discharge. In [42], the authors also demonstrated math-\nematical methods to determine the optimal concentration of\ninhibitors required for the natural-ester-ﬁlled transformers to\nimprove the oil’s oxidation stability and dielectric strength.\nBandara et al. evaluated the performance of natural-ester-\nbased oil paper/pressboard insulation; their studies aimed to\nunderstand the aging aspects of natural-ester-ﬁlled transform-\ners in high-moisture environments and the dielectric response\nof insulation [43]–[45]. They found that at ﬁrst the rate of\ndegradation of pressboard in natural esters is higher than\nthat in mineral oil, but later it is controlled. The hydrolytic\ndegradation of pressboard in mineral oil becomes prominent\nafter midlife, whereas degradation rates slow down with\naging in natural esters. This is because esters consume more\nmoisture during hydrolysis and maintain the dryness of solid\ninsulation, thus slowing the aging of cellulose. They also\nmentioned that hydrolytic deterioration of natural-ester-based\noil/paper insulation has no major impact on oil viscosity.\nDegradation of oil/paper insulation is mainly attributed to col-\nloidal particles and soluble particles. These decay products,\nalong with moisture, play an important role in hampering the\noil’s dielectric strength. The effects of cellulose particles [46],\nwater bubbles [47], and metal particles [40] on oil perfor-\nmance were investigated in different proportions with natural-\nester-based oil/paper insulation. Those studies focused on\nthe conductivity aspects of cellulose decay content, metal\nparticles, and moisture generated with respect to the insu-\nlation degradation and corresponding effect on breakdown\nvoltage. It is already established that the rate of degradation\nfor cellulose insulation paper is lower in ester ﬂuids than\nin mineral oils. This has been explicitly veriﬁed through\ndirect paper characterizations by subjecting ester-based\noil/paper insulation to vigorous thermal aging [48]–[54].\nDirect measurements such as degree of polymerization, mois-\nture on paper, cellulose crystal size, relative crystallinity of\ncellulose, expansion/shrinkage properties of cellulose press-\nboard, tensile strength, furan analysis and molecular proper-\nties have been reported. Esters seem to arrest the deterioration\nrate of cellulose insulants and thus prove superior to mineral\noils in terms of cellulose degradation index under the studied\nlaboratory conditions.\nB. RETROFILLING AND MISCIBILITY\nMineral oils and ester dielectric ﬂuids have the property\nof miscibility: they may be mixed to any proportions. The\nchallenge is to study the behavior of mixed oil and investigate\nthe optimal proportion of mixing for use in transformers.\nMixed oil is expected to have better electrical, dielectric and\noperational properties than mineral oil while being cheaper\nthan ester ﬂuids. In 2002, the dielectric properties, moisture\nbehavior and performance of insulation paper were investi-\ngated and reported for various proportions of mineral oil and\nester oil [16], [17]. It was also reported that the addition of\nesters to mineral oil improves the mineral oil’s performance\nwhile indicating the unavailability of standard procedures for\nmixing oils [55]. The properties of mineral oil and the perfor-\nmance of insulation paper are found to be improved with the\naddition of esters to mineral oil, but determining the propor-\ntion that would lead to optimal performance is a challenge.\nDielectric strength is considerably improved, thus reducing\nthe risk of malfunction due to insulation failure [56]. The\ncritical parameters, including kinematic viscosity, dielectric\nstrength and electrostatic charge tendency, were investigated\nin [18], [57]. The results indicated that 20% of mineral oil\nreplaced with synthetic esters is an optimal mixture for use\nin transformers. The interesting behavior and properties of\nmixed oils attracted the attention of researchers interested\nin mixed insulating ﬂuids, and research progressed toward\nlong-term aging studies. The aging behavior of mixed oil is\ninvestigated by subjecting it to accelerated thermal stresses;\nthe results supported the use of mixed oil [58]. Oxidative\naging studies of a blend of synthetic ester and mineral oil\n(20:80) investigated absorbance, dissolved decay products,\nand interfacial tension, and proved that the addition of esters\nslows the rate of degradation of mineral oil signiﬁcantly [21].\nLong-term degradation-monitoring curves based on interfa-\ncial tension and absorbance have been investigated for mixed\noil in comparison to mineral oil, synthetic esters and natural\nesters [59]. Degradation-monitoring curves are investigated\nthrough an explicit thermal aging process. The rate of deteri-\noration of esters is slower than for mineral oil and the addition\nof ester ﬂuids to mineral ﬂuids retards degradation. The\nthermal properties of oil with different proportions of syn-\nthetic esters and mineral oil were reported in [60], including\nmeasurements of thermal expansion, thermal conductivity,\nviscosity, density, and speciﬁc heat. Micro-level degrada-\ntion aspects of cellulosic insulation paper aged in 80%\nmineral oil and 20% synthetic esters have been reported\nusing Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, ﬂash point\nVOLUME 7, 2019 184557\nU. Mohan Raoet al.: Alternative Dielectric Fluids for Transformer Insulation System: Progress, Challenges, and Future Scope\nmeasurement, X-ray diffraction analysis, and dilatome-\ntry [61], [62]. It was reported that the reduction in cellulose\ncrystal size and shrinkage of cellulose ﬁbers can be prevented\nby introducing ester compounds into mineral oil. It was also\nreported that the environmental and ﬁre properties of mineral\noil could be improved by the addition of esters. Stability\nanalyses of mixed oil by thermal, electrical and breakdown\nstressing are presented in [22]. Oil absorbance and pressure\nvaried proportionally with the addition of esters.\nGassing tendency is reported to increase with the addition\nof ester compounds to mineral oil. Some authors recom-\nmend blended oil (80:20) for applications in transformers\nto achieve an effective techno-economical balance. Recently,\nthe performance of mixtures of olive oil and Jatropha oil\nwith mineral oil in different proportions has been investi-\ngated [63], [64]. The physicochemical, dielectric, and electric\nproperties were reported for different ratios of mineral oil\nand olive oil. It appears probable that the performance of\nmineral oil can be improved by adding vegetable oils. The\naddition of olive oil up to 15% and of Jatropha oil up to\n20% to mineral oil improves the mineral oil’s performance.\nRecently, the dielectric properties and heat-dissipating ability\nof blends of mineral oil with olive oil and sunﬂower oil were\ninvestigated and the study conﬁrmed the use of mixed oil for\nnon-cold-climate regions [65].\nC. PRE-BREAKDOWN PHENOMENA\nThe dielectric strength of insulating materials is generally\ncharacterized by withstanding voltages before application in\nelectrical equipment. This characterization is classiﬁed based\non the type of voltage used for testing: impulse waves and\npower frequency waves. Impulse voltage testing also serves\nfor basic insulation level (BIL) testing and is normally used to\ntest the insulation systems of large power transformers. Insu-\nlation engineers designing a transformer insulation system\nnormally use BIL with an additional safety margin. Break-\ndown and pre-breakdown phenomena are signiﬁcant topics\nthat must be researched to understand the breakdown process.\nResearch on these topics pertaining to mineral oils has contin-\nued for years, and critical reviews of studies are documented\nin [66], [67]. It is known that the pre-breakdown process\nand characteristics of breakdown events are attributable to\nthe chemical composition of the insulation liquid. Hence,\nthere is a real need to understand the breakdown phenomena\nassociated with new insulating liquids in comparison to min-\neral oils. Although several researchers have investigated these\naspects of ester-based insulating ﬂuids, there is still scope for\nresearch on the pre-breakdown and breakdown phenomena of\nnew insulating ﬂuids. This section summarizes work done on\nthese phenomena with ester ﬂuids.\nBreakdown for synthetic esters and natural esters is eval-\nuated at different electrode gap distances, and a relationship\nbetween breakdown voltage and gap distance has been estab-\nlished [68]. It is reported that streamer inception voltages\nare comparable to those found with mineral oil, but streamer\npropagation is faster in ester-based oils. The stopping lengths\nof streamers in esters and mineral oil are compared at various\nelectrode geometries in [69] for positive and negative stream-\ners. The authors observed that conductivity and stopping\nlengths of positive streamers are greater than for negative\nstreamers. The stopping lengths in natural esters are found to\nbe longer than those in mineral oils, especially with negative\npolarity. Discharge velocity and discharge spectra for mineral\noil and ester ﬂuids are studied and reported in [70]–[72]. The\nslow and fast discharges have been explained based on incep-\ntion voltage and applied voltage, and that slow discharges are\nreported to develop below acceleration voltages while fast\ndischarges develop above acceleration voltages.\nGenerally, slow or fast streamers accompany breakdown\nin dielectric liquids. Slow streamers are seen in 1st and 2nd\nmodes, while fast streamers are observed in 3rd and 4th\nmodes. The mode of streamer propagation depends on the\nmagnitude of test voltage and ﬁeld stress. Breakdowns in\ndielectric ﬂuids are usually noticed with slow (2nd mode) and\nfast (3rd mode) streamers; the 1st mode is difﬁcult to trace\nand the 4th mode requires high local ﬁeld stress. Although\nseveral streamer characteristics have been described in the\nliterature, streamer acceleration voltage is the most signiﬁ-\ncant parameter associated with streamer propagation. Accel-\neration voltage is deﬁned as the voltage at which propa-\ngation mode switches from 2nd to 3rd mode (or slow to\nfast). An increase in voltage beyond the acceleration voltage\nincreases streamer propagation velocity to several times the\nexisting velocity.\nWith an increase in propagation velocity, streamers’ shape\nand light also change. The spatial shapes and oscillography of\nstreamers have been investigated and analyzed in accordance\nwith propagation velocities, electrode gaps, and acceleration\nvoltages in mineral oil and synthetic esters [73], [74]. Syn-\nthetic esters were found to be inferior to mineral oils in resist-\ning the growth of a streamer. Researchers also investigated the\nlight emission properties and shape of streamers [75], [76]\nand reported that, for small electrode gaps, some streamer\ncharacteristics such as spatial shape, emission (light), and\naverage propagation velocities are similar in mineral and ester\nﬂuids.\nHowever, oscillography revealed minor differences in the\nintensities of light emitted for streamers generated in min-\neral oil, natural esters, and synthetic esters. This may be\nattributable to the fact that different oils have different chem-\nical bonds (composition), which lead to changes in the\nabsorbance and transmittance of light. Several researchers\nfound that ester ﬂuids are inferior to mineral oils at retarding\nstreamer propagation. Hence, there is a need to further inves-\ntigate the development and propagation aspects of streamers\nin ester-ﬁlled transformers. Streamer propagation in small\ngaps has been investigated for natural and synthetic esters in\ncomparison to mineral oil in [77]–[80], and it is reported that\nesters have less resistance to the propagation of fast energetic\nstreamers (3rd mode) than mineral oils due to the difference\nin the number of impulses supplied to the electrode setup.\nIt is also reported that the frequency of occurrence of the\n184558 VOLUME 7, 2019\nU. Mohan Raoet al.: Alternative Dielectric Fluids for Transformer Insulation System: Progress, Challenges, and Future Scope\nTABLE 3. Summary of research progress on pre-breakdown phenomena in esters.\nlight waves associated with the streamers produced in ester\nﬂuids is higher than the frequency of the pulses produced in\nthe case of mineral oil. The high number of pulses in ester\nﬂuids is due to the esters’ high moisture absorption, which\nresults in more water bubbles at high electric stress and thus\nmore weak points (water bubbles) [81]. The quick inception\nand fast propagation of streamers in esters must also be\ntaken into consideration in designing ester-ﬁlled transform-\ners. The main parameters affecting the inception and propa-\ngation of streamers in oil-ﬁlled transformers include streamer\nshape, stopping length, streamer velocity, streamer current,\nand light emission. Electrode geometry, internal temperature,\nhydrostatic pressure, chemical composition of the liquid,\nadditives in oil, aging products in oil, and aging of oil/paper\ninsulation also inﬂuence streamer parameters. These issues\nconcerning effects on streamer development, including the\nanalysis and modeling of streamers, which will be useful\nfor researchers and designers, are documented in [82], [83].\nRecently, rapeseed oil, soybean oil and modiﬁed palm oil\nhave been investigated for streamer characteristics in com-\nparison to mineral oils [84]–[89]. The emphasis was on\nstreamer shape (horizontal and vertical) for point plane elec-\ntrode conﬁguration under positive and negative polarities.\nParameters including stopping length, streamer velocity, and\nbreakdown voltage were investigated under different exper-\nimental conditions. Stopping lengths appear to be shorter\nVOLUME 7, 2019 184559\nU. Mohan Raoet al.: Alternative Dielectric Fluids for Transformer Insulation System: Progress, Challenges, and Future Scope\nfor pressboard/natural ester interfaces than with mineral oil.\nIt was also observed that streamer patterns for negative polar-\nity are thicker than for positive polarity in natural ester and\nmineral oil. In [90], inhomogeneity differences in breakdown\nvoltage between natural ester and mineral oils with differ-\nent electrode arrangements representing different ﬁelds in\nhomogeneity factors and different gap distances are reported.\nVarious electrode and conductor arrangements reported in\nthe literature on oil breakdown voltage studies were also\ndocumented. The effect of impurities on breakdown phenom-\nena of ester/cellulose-based oil/paper insulation is reported\nin [91] and [92] to examine the inﬂuence of wet/dry cellulose\nparticles and of copper during surface discharge activity. The\nimpact of moisture in oil and pressboard, with dry and wet oil\ncellulose insulants was investigated. It was found that ester\nﬂuids provide good resistance to impurities in bridging the\ngap between insulation and electrode compared to mineral\noil. The higher hydrolysis rate in ester ﬂuids than in mineral\noil reduces the degradation of cellulose and the possibility\nof decay products with aging. A summary of the research\nprogress on dielectric and pre-discharge phenomena in ester-\nbased ﬂuids is presented in Table 3.\nD. APPLICATION IN ON-LOAD TAP CHANGERS\nOn-load tap changers (OLTCs) are mechanical devices that\nhandle voltage and current between taps. The combined oper-\nation of movable contacts while constituting active terminals\nhas made transformer tap changers an important element of\npower transformers. Insulating ﬂuid is used in OLTCs for\ninsulation and immediate arc quenching during switching\noperations. The performance of alternative insulating ﬂuids\nin OLTC tanks should be studied. Like oil in the main tank,\nthe oil in OLTCs is in contact with cellulose, metal and\nsealing material. The degradation of insulating liquid in con-\nventional oil-switching OLTCs is mainly attributable to char-\nacteristic spark discharges and gassing. The consequences of\nthese sparks and gases are similar to those in the transformer\nmain tank. Nevertheless, the tendency to ﬁnd prolonged arcs,\nacids, and other toxic by-products of the degradation of oil in\nOLTC tanks is higher than in the main tank. The conventional\nnon-vacuum OLTC ﬁlled with ester ﬂuids is found to be\ninferior in terms of degradation rate [93]–[96]. Fast switching\narcs also lead to the production of excess concentrations of\nfree gases with ester ﬂuids. However, managing two different\ninsulating ﬂuids is a challenge for engineers and involves an\nelement of risk with the use of mineral oils. It is reported that\nvacuum switching tap changers are suitable for ester-ﬁlled\nOLTCs to avoid fast oil degradation. In vacuum switching\ntechnology, the switching mechanism is encapsulated in a\nvacuum medium within the diverter, which buffers the impact\nof arcing on oil degradation. Other than arcing, factors such\nas the physicochemical parameters of oil, pyrolysis of paper,\nand degradation of oil/paper insulation remain the same as\nin conventional tap changers. However, some special factors\nconcerning the use of esters in OLTC should be investigated:\n1) Discharge behavior (arc breaking)\nFIGURE 2. Schematic solution for transformers with common household\nof OLTC and main tank oil.\n2) Switching potential (arc breaking limits)\n3) Material compatibility (gaskets, metals)\n4) Mechanical and thermal limits (lubrication, heat-\ning/cooling)\n5) Gassing tendency (free gases)\nDespite the above-mentioned factors, electrical insulation is\nthe fundamental factor. The details of voltage and thermal\nlimits for OLTCs with ester ﬂuids and mineral oils have been\ninvestigated and the limiting values are reported in [97]. The\nperformance of ester ﬂuids in tap changers accommodated\nin the main tank (common household) is reported in [98].\nThe dissolved gases generated in vacuum switching tap-\nchanger units are much lower than in the main expansion tank.\nConsidering the high ﬂash point, high breakdown voltage,\nand low dissolved gases, OLTC units may be accommodated\nwithin the main tank [98]. Such a common household tank\ndesign reduces the cost of OLTC units and facilitates reduced\nmaintenance activities. This is because the costs of pipes,\nbreather, protection relay, and level indicator of oil of the\nOLTC are avoided in a common household design. The opti-\nmal schematic solution for a common household design of\ntap changers in the main tank is sketched in Figure 2. Note\nthat, for the OLTC conﬁguration to be accommodated in\nthe transformer main tank, a pressure relief device must be\nmounted on top of the OLTC to regulate and detect excess\npressure. This pressure relief device must be coordinated with\nthe breather conﬁguration through a Buchholz relay. Seal-\ning solutions, various design solutions, limiting values and\nspeciﬁcations, material compatibility, retroﬁlling aspects and\ncommon household options for OLTCs with ester ﬂuids were\n184560 VOLUME 7, 2019\nU.

Some observations on the application of ester fluids in OLTCs.\nrecently documented in [98]. The compatibility of materials\nwas researched and reported in [97], [99], and gaskets made\nof nitrile rubber were found not to be suitable while several\nother rubber mixtures tend to become brittle and hard with\nsynthetic esters. Gaskets made of ﬂour polymer rubber have\nbeen found to be compatible with ester ﬂuids. Materials used\nfor OLTCs must be capable of withstanding high thermal,\nelectrical and mechanical stresses simultaneously. Various\nfactors affecting the workability of ester ﬂuids in OLTCs are\nsummarized in Table 4.\nThe gassing tendency of ester oils in tap changers has also\nbeen analyzed, and it is reported that acetylene and hydrogen\nare key gases for partial discharges and the concentration of\nhydrogen increases with the increase in energy density. Also,\nethane is traceable in signiﬁcant concentrations even under\nnon-faulty conditions. Ethane is the key gas responsible for\nthermal aging/oxidative decomposition of esters [100], [101].\nA performance analysis considering the workability of ester\nﬂuids in OLTCs is reported in [102].\nE. APPLICATION IN COLD CLIMATES\nThe performance of the new insulating oils at low tempera-\nture is one of the important aspects that must be taken into\nconsideration. Low temperatures in cold countries alter the\ncooling performance, which is greatly affected by the viscos-\nity and pour point of the insulating oil. In countries where the\ntemperature regularly drops to less than 0 ◦C, the following\nabnormalities are likely to be encountered.\nDecrease in oil ﬂuidity: The viscosity of the oil increases\n(or the oil freezes, in some cases), reducing the longitudi-\nnal gradient and hampering the free circulation of oil. This\ngreatly affects the oil’s heat transfer behavior. V oids are not\nexpected during solid/liquid phase transition.\nIncrease in internal temperature: As the oil circulation\nslows down or ceases, the internal heat generated within the\nwinding-core assembly is locally arrested, impairing the solid\ninsulation system. This local heat accumulation leads to high\ninternal temperature gradients and severe hot spots.\nFailure of cooling systems: Because the external temper-\nature is much lower than the ambient temperature (excess\nsnowfall and freezing in some cases), the effective cool-\ning surface varies signiﬁcantly. This contributes to the\nreduced heat dissipation scenarios discussed above and fur-\nther impairs the cooling mechanism.\nIncrease in internal operating pressure: Local freezing\nand thawing of oil with reduced longitudinal gradients and\nsimultaneous local heating introduce variations in internal\npressure. Furthermore, the gases generated during operation\nincrease the internal pressure. This high pressure can cause\ndeformations of the tank or cooling tubes. This effect is\ngenerally particularly strong for sealed transformers. In the\ncase of breather transformers, the operational efﬁciency of the\nbreather conﬁguration may also be reduced due to external\nfreezing.\nImpact on useful life: High internal temperature accelerates\nthe deterioration of solid insulation and thus of insulation\nVOLUME 7, 2019 184561\nU. Mohan Raoet al.: Alternative Dielectric Fluids for Transformer Insulation System: Progress, Challenges, and Future Scope\noil. These situations cause hot spots and local discharges and\nreduce the effectiveness of the insulation system.\nReduction in the relative moisture content: Moisture in\nliquids, under fast-decreasing temperature transients, results\nin free water that may lead to electrical breakdown [103]. For\nexample, at room temperature, an absolute moisture content\nof about 30 ppm is considered safe for mineral oils. At a\ntemperature of about −20 ◦C, the absolute moisture content\nshould be less than 3 ppm [104]. These factors have led\nengineers and researchers to investigate two interesting trans-\nformer operating modes in studying freezing and thawing\naspects: (i) below-normal temperatures (less than 20 ◦C to\n25 ◦C); and (ii) above-normal temperatures (more than 20 ◦C\nto 25 ◦C). However, these modes can be investigated under\ndifferent loading conditions (0% to 100%) and durations\nbased on the objectives of the study. The former condition is\ncommonly known as a ‘‘cold start’’ of a transformer. A cold\nstart happens when a transformer is removed from service at a\nlow ambient temperature and then is returned to service some\ntime later. After the transformer is removed from service, its\ninternal temperature decreases exponentially until it reaches\nthe ambient temperature, which is expected to be very low.\nHere, oil ﬂuidity in the cooling system will be reduced and\noil may or may not ﬂow throughout the operating time. The\nlatter condition is also known as a ‘‘steady state.’’ It involves\noperating the transformer with a temperature and oil ﬂuidity\ndifferent from those at the ambient temperature (20 ◦C to\n25 ◦C). The oil temperature will be higher and ﬂuidity is\nexpected to increase with operating time. Few investigations\nof this kind have been reported and there is scope for further\nresearch on ester-based dielectric ﬂuids. Rapp et al. [105]\nevaluated the dielectric performance of natural esters veriﬁed\nafter 120 hours of freeze-thaw cycles at 0 ◦C, −30 ◦C, and\n−40 ◦C, compared with that of control samples at 25 ◦C. The\nrise in temperature at various locations (core steel, winding,\nand top oil) for a transformer energized with a full load\nat −30 ◦C was also investigated. It is reported that pour\npoint is not an effective indicator of the ﬂuidity of natural\nesters; instead, solidiﬁcation temperatures should be adopted.\nThe results proved that a transformer can be energized at\nthe solidifying temperature without experiencing any adverse\neffects. Natural-ester-based dielectric ﬂuids have relatively\nhigher solidiﬁcation temperatures than petroleum-based ﬂu-\nids. Moore et al. reported on comparative cold start proce-\ndures with mineral oils and natural esters [106]. They found\nthat the cold start procedure for natural-ester-ﬁlled trans-\nformers is the same as for mineral-oil-ﬁlled transformers.\nNo issues related to the oil’s physical or dielectric character-\nistics were noticed during the excitation or start-up process.\nExperimental investigations on the cold start and cold stor-\nage of synthetic-ester-ﬁlled transformers while simulating\ncooling sequences to extreme low temperatures are reported\nin [107]. The conclusion was that synthetic esters are capable\nof withstanding operations at extremely low temperatures and\ncope even under sudden load fall conditions in cold climates.\nStorage produced no abnormal conditions with ester-ﬁlled\ntransformers. The authors investigated the cooling aspects of\ncold start and steady state conditions for ester-ﬁlled trans-\nformers under different loads for temperatures ranging from\n−50 ◦C to −30 ◦C. Temperature rises at different loads\nare reported in [108]. The properties of some commercially\navailable ester ﬂuids with pour points lower than −30 ◦C are\nsummarized in Table 5.\nWith an emphasis on a complete cold start of the trans-\nformer [109], two different test conditions were investigated:\n(i) with a 40% load at −50 ◦C; and (ii) with a full load at\n−40 ◦C. The time required for complete activation of the\nradiators was reported to be approximately 14 hours in test\ncondition (ii) for the transformer in question. The oil heat\ndissipation process with a cold start is presented in [110],\nin which the authors reported thermal calculations for a tem-\nperature range of from −40 ◦C to 40 ◦C. However, one of the\nmost important questions in case of a cold start is the time\nrequired to activate radiators for various insulating ﬂuids.\nF. ENVIRONMENTAL AND FIRE PROPERTIES\nAmong the major concerns with insulating ﬂuids are their\nrenewability and biodegradability and their respect of envi-\nronmental regulations in case of accidental ﬁres or spillage.\nMineral oils are not biodegradable and have a poor emis-\nsion proﬁle, which means they are hazardous to humans\nand aquatic life (in the event of spills). Hence, alternative\noils must respect environmental regulations and should not\nbe hazardous. Along these lines, several researchers have\ninvestigated the environmental and ﬁre-related performance\nof ester-based dielectric ﬂuids. This section covers studies\nof these factors in ester dielectric ﬂuids compared with min-\neral insulating oils. The environmental aspects include major\nparameters such as biodegradability, toxicity, and sustainabil-\nity while the ﬁre properties include ﬂash point, ﬁre point, and\nemission proﬁle of the insulating ﬂuid. Oommen et al. [117]\nhighlighted the biodegradability of ester-based insulating liq-\nuids for safe transformer insulation. McShane [118] dis-\ncussed the environmental performance of ester ﬂuids and\npresented an attempt to enhance the oxidation stability\nof these ﬂuids in order to increase the biological oxygen\ndemand. When the ﬂuid is disposed of after complete usage or\nduring a spill, oil should not pollute the environment; rather,\nit should be completely biodegradable. Biodegradability is\nthe measure of biological oxygen demand (BOD), which is\nthe amount of oxygen available for micro-organisms to utilize\nin their food chains, as a result of which the oil’s struc-\nture is damaged and it is biodegraded. Hence, higher BOD\nindicates good biodegradability of the ﬂuid. Thomas [119]\nand Boss et al. [120] evaluated the environmental perfor-\nmance of ester dielectrics in comparison with mineral oils\nand found ester dielectrics to be environmentally friendly; the\nbiodegradability of esters makes green transformer technol-\nogy possible. Bertrand and Hoang [121] demonstrated esters’\nnontoxicity, low oxidation stability, and biodegradability, and\nshowed that the by-products of thermal aging present accept-\nably low risk. They also suggested that more research on\n184562 VOLUME 7, 2019\nU. Mohan Raoet al.: Alternative Dielectric Fluids for Transformer Insulation System: Progress, Challenges, and Future Scope\nTABLE 5.

Generally, antioxidants/inhibitors are\nadded to transformer ﬂuids to restrict the rate of oxidation.\nThe types of inhibitors and their effects on ester aging have\nbeen less studied.\nEmission proﬁle is an important marker related to the envi-\nronmental performance of any insulating ﬂuid. It indicates the\nnature and type of gases released and the behavior of ﬂames\nwhen the ﬂuid is subjected to combustion. Insulating ﬂuids’\nﬁre point and ﬂash point refer to the maximum temperature\nat which an insulating ﬂuid may be safely used without\nsigniﬁcant risk of ﬁre. Ideally, ﬂuids should only ignite at\nhigh temperatures and the gases liberated should not damage\nhealth and safety. Mineral insulating oils are combinations\nof hydrocarbons and release hazardous gases when ignited,\nunlike ester oils. Conversely, ester oils are combinations of\nacids and alcohols obtained from a biological process and are\nnot environmentally harmful. Arazoe et al. [122] investigated\nthe burning/ﬁre characteristics of various insulating ﬂuids\nand found that esters are more difﬁcult to ignite than mineral\noils. A summary of ﬁre/burning characteristics is presented\nin Table 6.\nAmin et al. [123] and Redond et al. [124] tested the\nenvironmental performance and behavior of esters and min-\neral oils in contact with soil and water according to the\nOrganization for Economic Co-operation and Develop-\nment (OECD) testing standards and found that ester\ndielectrics outperformed mineral insulating oils in terms\nof environmental standards. The safety, non-toxicity, eco-\nfriendliness, and sustainability of ester-based insulating oils\nproved that esters are a better alternative for a safer and\ngreener transformer insulating technology. Ester ﬂuids are\na better choice of liquid insulation in places where envi-\nronmental regulations are restrictive. Recently, changes in\nthe ﬂash point of various insulating ﬂuids with respect to\ndegradation of oils have been reported [62]. Changes in the\nﬂash point of mineral oil (MO), natural ester (NE), and syn-\nthetic ester (SE) as a function of thermal aging are illustrated\nin Figure 3.\nThe superior ﬁre performance of ester-based oils has been\nveriﬁed for different mixtures of mineral oil, synthetic esters\nand natural esters [62]. Their dielectric properties, caloriﬁc\nvalues, ﬁre point, and ﬂash point have been reported as\na function of different mixture ratios [125]. Flash point is\nveriﬁed by open cup and closed cup methods for different\noil proportions with synthetic esters, natural esters, and min-\neral oils. It is reported that the difference in the open cup\nand closed cup ﬂash points increases with greater synthetic\nester content. Moreover, the addition of esters to mineral oil\nimproves the dielectric and ﬁre properties. Flash points and\nﬁre points are reported to be improved with the addition of\n184564 VOLUME 7, 2019\nU.

Environmental properties of ester fluids and mineral oil [1], [5], [24].\nFIGURE 3. Variation of flash point with thermal aging [62].\nesters. Recently, different cooling modes for mineral oil and\nsynthetic-ester-ﬁlled transformers were investigated for dif-\nferent winding models, as reported in [126]. Natural esters\nand synthetic esters are known for their ﬁre-resistant prop-\nerties, and the potential of natural ester ﬂuids to protect\nagainst ﬁres has been investigated by researchers and is\nreported in [127], with the details of thermal properties,\nheat radiation, and internal pressure. A natural-ester-ﬁlled\ntransformer is able to withstand an external ﬁre without\nburning for 30 minutes, which is ample time to extinguish the\nﬁre.\nThe environmental properties of mineral oil, synthetic\nesters and natural esters are tabulated in Table 7.\nV. FUTURE RESEARCH: CHALLENGES AND PROSPECTS\nThe majority of the research on ester dielectric ﬂuids has\nfocused on understanding their degradation behavior and\ncompatibility with cellulose insulation. Although research\nstudies support the use of these ﬂuids as alternatives to\nmineral oils, there are several challenges that should be\ninvestigated. These challenges that should be addressed to\nimprove our knowledge of ester ﬂuids are listed below.\nSome utilities around the world are already using ester\nﬂuids in oil-ﬁlled apparatus. Long-term in-service experi-\nence data concerning the condition monitoring of ester-ﬁlled\ntransformers may be useful. This real-time information on\ninsulation behavior will be helpful in establishing the limits\nof potential aging markers. Such information will also be\nhelpful in understanding and developing diagnostic tools for\nester-ﬁlled apparatus. The miscibility of esters with mineral\noils has been proven, and the addition of esters improves the\ndielectric performance of mineral oil: the blend thus formed is\nbetter than mineral insulating oils. Hence, more investigation\non retroﬁlling of ester ﬂuids would be informative if utilities\nwish to retroﬁll existing units with mineral oils. The behavior\nof mineral-oil-ﬁlled (impregnated and aged) solid insulation\nsystems when retroﬁlled with ester ﬂuids must be reported.\nReal-time condition monitoring information and retroﬁlling\nstudies could lead to increased use of ester ﬂuids for oil-ﬁlled\napparatus.\nFailure rates in tap changers are higher than in trans-\nformers, albeit with less serious consequences. The appli-\ncation of ester ﬂuids in OLTCs is an interesting challenge\nfor future research. However, very few studies have reported\non this topic. Detailed dissolved gas analyses of ester-ﬁlled\ntap changers have been reported. With the rapid change in\npotential of the active terminals in tap changers, the degra-\ndation of insulating ﬂuids differs from that of oil in the tank.\nHence, the degradation behavior of oil in the tap changers\nshould be studied. The diagnostic parameters and dielectric\nproperties of alternative oils in OLTCs should be examined.\nWith frequent unwanted discharges and arcs in tap changers,\nVOLUME 7, 2019 184565\nU. Mohan Raoet al.: Alternative Dielectric Fluids for Transformer Insulation System: Progress, Challenges, and Future Scope\nthe deterioration of oil is expedited due to regular electrical\nstressing. Note that the role of cellulose insulants in the\ndegradation of tap changer oil is not signiﬁcant. The inﬂuence\nof low-energy and high-energy discharges on the functional\nbehavior of ester ﬂuids in the absence of cellulose insulants\nshould also be investigated. Carbon deposits usually build\nup on tap changer terminals, leading to increased contact\nresistance, which in turn leads to further heating and carbon\nbuildup in the active parts. This issue must be better under-\nstood to ensure the effective functionality of ester ﬂuids in tap\nchangers.\nThe majority of research on pre-breakdown phenomena\nhas been carried out on point plane electrodes, while little\nwork has been done on sphere plane electrodes. Most such\nresearch sought to understand streamer behavior and prop-\nerties including streamer velocity, streamer length, streamer\nshape, charge and current. The inﬂuence of aging factors and\nother diagnostic/operational parameters on streamer prop-\nagation has not yet been investigated. Several researchers\nhave reported on the impact of moisture and metal particles\non breakdown phenomena. However, cellulose particles and\nother decay particles also have a major impact in real-time\nconditions. The effect of electrode geometry (gap length,\nshape, tip radius) has been reported by several authors, but\nwithout considering the aging of the oil and cellulose insu-\nlants.\nThe workability of synthetic and natural esters compared\nwith mineral insulating oils is another area of research. Some\nsigniﬁcant observations that are related to the workability of\nester ﬂuids have been summarized in Table 8.\nIn [4], methods for improving the workability of natu-\nral esters are reported, including dispersion of pour point\nusing Poly(methyl methacrylate). Natural esters suffer from\nlow lightning impulse resistance, so several researchers have\nattempted to improve the resistance of natural esters by using\nazobenzene and dimethylaniline as additives [4], [130]. Addi-\ntives designed to address speciﬁc concerns require detailed\ninvestigation to understand their compatibility with dielectric\nﬂuids in operating environments. Therefore, there is scope\nfor research on additives and chemical scavengers to improve\nthe performance of dielectric ﬂuids. Moreover, resistance to\noxidation and high viscosity are major concerns related to\nnatural esters that should be further investigated. However,\nthe change in viscosity with aging of an alternative ﬂuid with\na very low pour point in comparison to natural ester, synthetic\nester and mineral oil is presented in [131].\nEnd-of-life criteria for alternative insulating ﬂuids is\nanother important concern for the industry. The degradation\nof ester ﬂuids presents an absence of colloidal particles at\nlow and moderate aging [132]; however, soluble particles are\nseen with aging of ester ﬂuids. The application of fuller’s\nearth for ester ﬂuids is still questionable, and several authors\nhave reported on the use of different adsorbents for treatment\nof ester dielectric ﬂuids. Still there is a lot of scope for\nresearch on additives and adsorbents that are compatible with\nalternative dielectric ﬂuids.\nTABLE 8. Workability observations of various insulating oils in\ntransformers [1], [4], [5], [24].\nEnhancement of the dielectric, thermal, and physical prop-\nerties of the new alternative ﬂuids by adding nanoparti-\ncles is another fruitful new topic of research [133]. It has\nbeen reported that the smart liquids developed with some\nspeciﬁc nanoparticles can be customized according to the\nchoice of applications in oil-ﬁlled apparatus [1], [24]. Sev-\neral researchers have investigated dielectric strength, vis-\ncosity, pour point, oxidation, dielectric properties, thermal\nproperties, and streamer propagation in nano-based ester\nﬂuids [134]–[136]. A signiﬁcant improvement is noticed\nwith the addition of different nanoparticles. Nevertheless,\nfurther research should emphasize the aging behavior of\nthese nanoﬂuids and their compatibility with other trans-\nformer materials. Recently, a laboratory-based synthesis of\ntrimethylolpropane ester-based dielectric ﬂuids aimed to\nimproving their properties while maintaining an equilibrium\n184566 VOLUME 7, 2019\nU. Mohan Raoet al.: Alternative Dielectric Fluids for Transformer Insulation System: Progress, Challenges, and Future Scope\nbetween ﬂash point, oxidation stability, pour point, and vis-\ncosity [137]. However, the service behavior of these oils\nand the effect of various additives on oil must still be\nexamined.\nImportantly, with the increase in demand for green energy,\nbulk power is being integrated into the electrical grid via dis-\ntributed generation. Distributed generation involves concepts\nlike various renewable sources, vehicle to grid, hybrid and\nplugin electric vehicles, etc. Power from distributed genera-\ntion is involved in non-linear fast switching actions that affect\ngrid parameters. Hence, the reliability of future insulation\nsystems must be improved to deal with frequent switching\ntransients.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nIn this article, progress in research and the state of the art\nof key aspects that must be addressed concerning the pos-\nsible usage of ester dielectric ﬂuids are presented, followed\nby proposals for future research. A critical emphasis on\nrecent progress, miscibility, and retroﬁlling of ester ﬂuids\nwas noted. In addition, a review of pre-breakdown behavior,\nthe use of esters in on-load tap changers, environmental and\nﬁre properties, and use of ester dielectric ﬂuids in cold cli-\nmates was presented. Future challenges related to alternative\ndielectric ﬂuids were described. This survey will be useful for\nresearchers and practitioners interested in alternative dielec-\ntric ﬂuids for possible applications in high-voltage oil-ﬁlled\napparatus.\nREFERENCES\n[1] I.
