Introduction \n \n To analyze the operating conditions of a pulse transformer thoroughly, a mathematical \nmodel taking into account all phenomena which are essential to describe its behavior is \nneeded. Among other things, an accurate re presentation of the phenomenon of magnetic \nhysteresis as well as the calculation of power losses in the core connected therewith present \nmany problems. Usually the phenomenon of magnetic hysteresis is omitted during the field \nanalysis of electromagnetic converters, and the magnetic properties of a ferromagnetic \nmaterial are described by mean s of a unique magnetization curve. Such a simplification can \nnot be applied when the hysteresis loss in the core is determined. The influence of the \ntemperature of sub-assemblies of the converter on the course of transient phenomena is rarely \ntaken into consideration [1]. \n In the paper, a field model taking into account the influence of magnetic hysteresis and \ntemperature on the course of  transient electromagnetic phenom ena has been proposed to \nanalyze a pulse transformer operating at high fre quency. The Jiles-Atherton model has been \napplied to represent the hysteresis. The equa tions describing the electromagnetic and thermal \n                                          W. Łyskawiński, P.

The elaborated algorithm and software for the analysis \nof the coupled phenomena in a pulse transformer was used to determine hysteresis loss. \n \n2. Jiles-Atherton hysteresis model \n In the Jiles-Atherton model [2, 10], it is assumed that the magnetization M of a material is \ncaused by the factors representing reversible processes Mrev and irreversible processes Mirr \noccurring during the magnetization of the core \n  rrirev MMM +=  (1) \nin the above equation, the irreversible processes occurring in the course of magnetization are \ndescribed by a differential equation \n  ,)(d\nd\nrrian\nrrianirr\nMMk\nMM\nH\nM\n−−\n−= αδ  (2) \nwhere ,ddsgn tH=δ  Man is a non-hysteresis magnetization curve  \n  .coth ⎟⎟\n⎠\n⎞\n⎜⎜\n⎝\n⎛\n+−+= MH\na\na\nMHMM satan\nα\nα  (3) \n In the above relations, k and α are the factors depending on material parameters, a is the \nshape factor, and the saturation magnetization is denoted by Msat. \n In the model, it is assumed that the reversible processes inside a material are described by \nthe equation \n  \n,)( irranrev MMcM −=  (4) \nwhere c is the factor depending on the type of material. \n By substituting (4) into (1) and then differe ntiating the achieved expression it is obtained \nas follows \n  ( )( ) .d\nd\n)(\n1\nd\nd\nH\nMcMMk\nMMc\nH\nM an\nirran\nrrian\n+−−\n−−= αδ  (5) \n When modeling the voltage-excited magnetic field, it is necessary to calculate the mag-\nnetic field strength intensity on the basis of magnetic flux density.

It was assumed that \nthe heat flux \nq penetrating through the external surf ace is proportional to the temperature \ndifference between this surface and the environment, i.e., q = k (∂ϑ  / ∂n) = cp(ϑ ot – ϑ ), \nwhere cp is the equivalent coefficient of giving up the heat. \n The density of power losses p in the equation (9) is determined on the basis of the time and \nspatial distribution of the current density j from the relation \n  .\n2\nγ\nJp =  (10) \n The equations (7), (8), (9) are coupled by the conductivity γ (ϑ ) and permeability : (B, \nϑ ) of materials as well as the density of power losses p. For this reason they should be solved \nsimultaneously. To solve these equations, the method of finite elements and the method „step-\nby-step” were used [7, 3].

In order to solve the system \nof non-linear coupled equations (11) and (12), the block relaxation method and the Newton-\nRaphson algorithm were used. \n The hysteresis power loss in the core is determined by the following expression \n  ,Δ\n1\n∑\n=\n=\nlr\ni\nihih VwfP  (13) \nwhere lr is the number of the finite elements digitizing the core, f is the frequency, Vi is the \nvolume of the i-th element in which the density of energy being lost during one magnetization \ncycle \n  () ,21\n1\n1\n∑\n=\n−\n−\n−+=\nnt\nn\nnn\nnn\nhi BBHHw  (14) \nwhere Bn, Bn – 1, Hn, Hn – 1 are the magnetic flux density and intensity, respectively, in the i-th \nelement obtained for the n-th and ( n – 1)-th time step, and tn is the number of time steps \nwithin one magnetization period of the core. \n \n \n4. Calculation results \n \n On the basis of the presented algorithm of solving the equations of the discrete model, the \nsoftware to simulate and visualize transient electromagnetic and heat phenomena in a pulse \ntransformer, taking into account magnetic hysteresis, has been elaborated. This software was \nused to analyze hysteresis loss. A considered pulse transformer ETD 44 type is shown in Fig. 2.  \n \nFig. 2. Pulse transformer \n                                          W.

In or der to take into account the influence of the \ntemperature on magnetic properties of ferrite F867, the hysteresis loops family was determi-\nned. The selected results of measurements are sh own in Fig. 3. The parameters required in the \nJiles-Atherton model for a few temperatures were determined on the basis of the measured \nhysteresis loops. The parameters of the Jile s-Atherton model for these temperatures were \nestimated by minimizing the error described by equation  \n  \n() ,1\n1\n2\nmeassim∑\n=\n−=\nN\nj\njj BBNε  (15) \nwhere N is the number of measuring points, Bj meas and Bj sim are respectively measured and cal-\nculated magnetic flux densities.  \n In Figure 3, the loops of the hysteresis ob tained from the Jiles-Atherton model are also \nshown. A considerable agreement between re sults of measurements and calculations was \nobtained. For the purpose of determining magnetic properties of the core for any temperature, \na linear approximation was used.  \n \n \nFig. 3. Measured and modelled hysteresis loops for (a) 30°C and (b) 90°C \n \n A work of the transformer has been analyzed at different shapes of the course and the fre-\nquency of supply voltage. During the simulations, the ratio of voltage amplitude to frequency \nwas constant. The initial instant of connecting supply voltage was selected so that the steady \nstate could be obtained as soon as possible. Therefore the duration of calculations has been \nshortened considerably. Exemplary hysteresis loops obtained as a result of the calculations are \nshown in Fig. 4. They present the relationships \nB(H) determined at the point P of the middle \ncolumn of the core (Fig. 2) at the nominal load of the transformer supplied with pulse and \nsinusoidal voltage with a frequency of 100 kHz as well as pulse voltage with a frequency of \n200 kHz.  \n It was assumed that the transformer was supplied with rectangular voltage pulses of nega-\ntive and positive polarization. In order to obtain the constant value of rectified voltage at the \nsystem output was achieved by modulating the pulse width in the range of 5 to 45%.  \n The influence of frequency on hysteresis losses at pulse and sinusoidal supply was exa-\nmined. The selected results are shown in Fig. 5. \nVol.  60(2011)                     Numerical analysis of hysteresis loss in pulse transformer 193 \n \nFig. 4. Hysteresis loops determined for: a) sinusoidal supply voltage (f = 100 kHz, C8.56 o=ϑ ), \nb) impulse supply voltage (f = 100 kHz, C5.60 o=ϑ ), c) impulse supply voltage (f = 200 kHz, \nC.1.53 o=ϑ ) \n \nFig. 5. Relative hysteresis loss in the core \nwith respect to frequency \n \n It follows from them that in the examined range of pulse supply, the losses increase \nslightly with an increase in frequency at the beginning, and then they decrease quickly. The \nhysteresis losses have a maximal value when the pulse-duty factor is equal to 45%. From the \nperformed analysis, it results that the pulse-duty factor \nki needed to obtain the set voltage \nvalue at the transformer output decreases with an increase in  frequency (Fig. 6). For this \nreason, the current in the windings, and so also the magnetic field intensity in the core, \nincreases to a more and more little value with an increase in frequency. The effect was that the \nhysteresis loop and also hysteresis losses d ecrease with an increase in frequency and the \n                                          W. Łyskawiński, P. Sujka, W.

But for a frequency less than 65 kHz, after the pulse-duty factor \nhas achieved the boundary value of 45% (Fig. 6), the losses in the core decrease because of the \nfrequency decreases with a slight increase of the surface area of hysteresis loop.  \n \nFig. 6. PWM factor frequency characteristics \n \n \n5. Conclusions \n \n In the paper, the field model of a pulse transformer taking into account the influence of \nmagnetic hysteresis on the course of coupled electromagnetic and heat phenomena have been \npresented. The Jiles-Atherton model was used to represent hysteresis. The elaborated algo-\nrithm and software for the analysis of coupled electromagnetic and heat phenomena, taking \ninto account magnetic hysteresis, were used among other things, to examine the influence of \nthe course shape and frequency of  supply voltage on the hysteresis losses of a transformer. In \nthe authors’ opinion, the elabor ated software can be useful fo r designing pulse transformers \nand the analysis of hysteresis power losses.  \n \n \nReferences \n \n [1] Driesen J., Coupled electromagnetic-thermal problems in electrical energy transducers.
