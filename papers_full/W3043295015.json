    "abstract": "Medium-frequency transformer (MFT) dc bias is critical for the safe operation of dual-active-bridge (DAB) converters. To analyze the dc bias, expressions of dc bias are derived for SiC MOSFET DAB converters. It shows that the dc bias is a current source in steady state; thus, a dc bias current capacity is defined and used as a design constraint in the optimization of MFT. The dc bias current capacity is related to core materials, geometric parameters, and flux density, which is analyzed with analytical expression. Optimization equations with geometric variables are derived, which can be solved theoretically or numerically for both interleaved winding (IW) and separated winding (SW) MFT without and/or with leakage inductance design. Based on the optimization equations, different MFT designs for a 150-kW SiC MOSFET DAB converter are compared on the aspects of core materials, winding structures, and without/with leakage inductance design. The combination of IW structure MFT with auxiliary phase shift inductors is chosen, and the assembled prototype is tested with the 150-kW DAB converter. Here, the designed dc bias capacity, temperature rise, and efficiency are verified.",
