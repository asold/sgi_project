  "abstract": "Abstract Background The quality and accessibility of menstrual health education in developing nations, including India, remain inadequate due to challenges such as poverty, social stigma, and gender inequality. While community-driven initiatives aim to raise awareness, artificial intelligence (AI) offers a scalable solution for disseminating accurate information. However, existing general-purpose large language models (LLMs) are ill-suited for this task, suffering from low accuracy, cultural insensitivity, and overly complex responses. To address these limitations, we developed MenstLLaMA, a specialized LLM tailored to the Indian context, designed to deliver menstrual health education empathetically, supportively, and accessible. Objective To develop and evaluate MenstLLaMA, a specialized LLM tailored to deliver accurate, culturally sensitive menstrual health education, and to assess its effectiveness compared to existing general-purpose models. Methods We curated MENST, a novel domain-specific dataset comprising 23,820 question-answer pairs, aggregated from medical websites, government portals, and health education resources. This dataset was systematically annotated with metadata capturing age groups, regions, topics, and socio-cultural contexts. MenstLLaMA was developed by fine-tuning Meta-LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct using Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) techniques to achieve domain alignment with reduced computational overhead. We benchmarked MenstLLaMA against nine state-of-the-art general-purpose LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude-3, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Mistral, and others. The evaluation followed a multi-layered framework: (1) automatic evaluation using BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE-L, and BERTScore metrics (2) expert evaluation by clinical experts (N=18) rating 200 expert-curated queries (3) medical practitioner interaction using an interactive chatbot (ISHA) for qualitative assessment across Relevance, Understandability, Preciseness, Correctness and Context sensitivity and (4) a user study with volunteer participants (N=200) evaluating MenstLLaMA in 15–20 minute randomized sessions for user satisfaction assessment on performance across seven qualitative metrics. Results MenstLLaMA achieved the highest BLEU (0.059) and BERTScore (0.911), outperforming GPT-4o (BLEU: 0.052, BERTScore: 0.896) and Claude-3 (BERTScore: 0.888). Clinical experts preferred MenstLLaMA’s responses over gold-standard answers in several culturally sensitive cases. In evaluation by medical practitioners ISHA, the chat interface of MenstLLaMA, it scored 3.5 in Relevance, 3.6 in Understandability , 3.1/5 in Preciseness , 3.5/5 in Correctness , and 4.0/5 in Context Sensitivity . User evaluations indicated strong ratings for Understandability (4.7/5), Relevance (4.3/5), Preciseness (4.28/5), Correctness (4.1/5), Tone (4.6/5), Flow (4.2/5), and Context Sensitivity (3.9/5). Conclusions MenstLLaMA demonstrates exceptional accuracy, empathy, and user satisfaction in menstrual health education, bridging critical gaps left by general-purpose LLMs. Its potential for integration into broader health education platforms positions it as a transformative tool for menstrual well-being. Future research may explore its long-term impact on public perception, menstrual hygiene practices, expanding demographic representation, enhancing context sensitivity, and integrating multi-modal and voice-based interactions for broader accessibility.",
