    "abstract": "The increased integration of Electric Vehicles (EVs) into the distribution network can create severe issues—especially when demand response programs and time-varying electricity prices are applied, EVs tend to charge during the off-peak time to minimize the electricity cost. Hence, another peak demand might be created, and other solutions are required. Many researchers tried to solve the problem; however, limitations exist because of the decentralized topology of the network. The system operator is not allowed to control the end-users’ load due to security and privacy issues. To overcome this situation, we propose a novel data-energy management algorithm on the transformer’s level that controls the power demand profiles of the householders and exchange energy between them without violating their privacy and security. Our method is compared to an existing one in the literature based on a decentralized control strategy. Simulations show that our approach has reduced the electricity cost of the end-users by 3%, increased the revenue of the system operator, and reduced techno-economic losses by 50% and 42%, respectively. Our strategy shows better performance even with a 100% penetration level of EVs on the network, in which it respects the network’s constraints and maintains the voltage within the recommended limits.",
