FV is\ngrateful to MAECI (Ministero degli Affari Esteri e\ndella Cooperazione Internaziona le) and Sapienza\nUniversity Internation al Agreements for their\nas early as 2.6 Ma in Africa and persist until 500–300 ka in Asia and Europe [1–11], predating\nthe canonical Lower Paleolithic handaxes [see 12 for an overview].\nGiven their widespread distribution through time and space, choppers and chopping tools\nhave been discussed in several studies concerning Lower Paleolithic assemblages [e.g., 13–18].\nDespite of that, a lack of sufficient criteria has hindered their secure classification either as\ncores or formal tools and many scholars preferred to classify them as both core and tool [14].\nAccording to Leakey [19], a chopper is a core-tool with a flaked edge on one or two inter-\nsected faces. It is unifacial if the edge was formed by flaking only on one face of the item, and\nbifacial if both faces were flaked. Bifacially flaked core-forms (namely a worked nodule/pebble\nas opposed to a worked flake/blade) were classified by Movius [20] as chopping tools. Keeley\n[21] and Singer [18] defined chopping tools as “chopper-cores” while Semenov [22] coined the\nterm “core-like chopping tool”, a term used at that time in the Western and Soviet archeologi-\ncal literature.\nThe characterization of a core form as either core or core tool is very subtle and is still\ndebated among scholars [for an overview on this topic, see 23 and contributions therein].\nM. Leakey was the first to typologically characterize core-tool forms (pebbles and angular\nrock fragments from which flakes were removed) such as choppers and heavy-duty scrapers as\n“heavy-duty tools” [19, 24, 25]. She, however, classified Oldowan core-tools on the basis of\nmorphology alone, with no data regarding their function, notwithstanding her assumption\nthat most of the core-forms were deliberately produced to be used as designated tools. Advo-\ncating a different approach, Isaac [26] and Toth [13, 27] argued that “core-forms” in Oldowan\nassemblages were by-products (namely cores) resulting from the production of sharp usable\ncutting flakes rather than being the target forms. Although Toth does not deny the possibility\nthat some “core-forms” were used as tools, he also remarks that heavy-duty tasks are easily per-\nformed with unshaped cobbles [13].\nKeeley and Toth argued that core-tools can be the result of flaking stone cobbles or chunks\nmainly to produce sharp stone flakes. This assumption was supported, to some extent, by a\nstudy of 54 fine-grained flakes and flake fragments from Koobi Fora, Kenya (1.9–1.4 million\nyears ago), which showed the presence of diagnostic polishes on 9 flakes [28]. Moreover,\nexperiments performed by Toth [13], demonstrated that all varieties of core-forms, long\nassumed to be deliberately shaped \"tools\", can result from flaking stone cobbles or chunks to\nproduce sharp flakes.\nThe idea that items classified as choppers and chopping tools are in fact cores used for flake\nproduction is not new and has been advocated for several decades [13, 23, 26–27, 29]. It is fur-\nther supported by the little evidence of use-wear related to chopping activities using chopping\ntools [14].\nThe first detailed microwear analysis of core-chopping tool was Keeley’s study of flaked\nstone artifacts from Clacton and Hoxne [21]. He analyzed 22 chopper-cores from Clacton and\nfound reliable wear on only 2 artefacts which were interpreted as having been used to chop\nwood [21:116]. Two other chopper-cores from Hoxne displayed traces of bone and were inter-\npreted as having been used to open up bone for marrow extraction [21:140, 146].\nChopping tools have been frequently associated with bone breaking and heavy duty-wood\nworking [13, 21, 30, 31], but no extensive functional microscopic examination for this class of\nartefacts has been conducted in recent years.\nWith the aim of filling this gap, this work discusses the technology and function of these\nubiquitous early lithic artifacts presenting an integrated techno-functional and residue analysis\non 53 chopping tools and 50 pebble cores. The analyzed material was recovered from Area C\nLayer 3 at the Late Acheulean site of Revadim (Israel). We explore the role of chopping tools\nwithin the lithic assemblage and interpret them in light of results from a sample of flake cores\nPLOS ONE\nChopping tools from Revadim were used to chop hard and medium materials such as bone\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02455 95 January 19, 2021 2 / 37\nfinancial support of this research.

Our integrated approach com-\nbines flint type characterization, typo-technological classification, experimental observations,\nuse-wear analysis and morphological observations combined with elemental and chemical\nanalysis of residues. The results show that a great percentage of chopping tools were used for\npounding activities on hard and medium materials with direct correspondence between use-\nwear and residues related to bone processing activities. It is therefore suggested that in the case\nof Revadim, chopping tools were mostly used as designated tools aimed at marrow extraction.\nA few of the tools also served for activities of scraping and cutting, thus highlighting the poten-\ntial versatility of these artefacts.\nArchaeological context\nRevadim is an open-air site located on the southern Coastal Plain of Israel, ~40 km southeast\nof Tel-Aviv, 71–73 m above sea level [32] (Fig 1A). Several excavation seasons were carried out\nbetween 1996 and 2004 on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority and the Hebrew Univer-\nsity of Jerusalem, under the direction of O. Marder and I. Milevski [32, 33].\nThe site was preliminarily dated using paleomagnetic analyses of the geological sequence.\nThe results demonstrated normal polarity, showing that the entire sequence is younger than\n780,000 years [33]. Uranium series dating of carbonates covering flint items was also con-\nducted, providing a minimum age of between 300,000 and 500,000 years [34]. The lithic\nassemblages are dominated by flakes and flake-tools, along with bifaces, chopping tools and\nflake-cores [35–37] (Fig 1B and 1C).\nThe faunal assemblage of Revadim has yielded thousands of animal bones. Faunal analysis\nwas performed mainly on the Area B assemblage and was focused on the elephant bones, while\nArea C was investigated to a lesser extent [36, 38, 39]. The faunal assemblage consists mainly\nof bone splinters and the represented animal taxa include Palaeoloxodon antiquus, Bos primi-\ngenius, Dama cf. mesopotamica, Cervus elaphus, Capreolus cf. capreolus in addition to other\nmammals such as wild boar (Sus scrofa), equids and micro-vertebrates. The major accumula-\ntion of elephant bones was retrieved from Area B, where at least three individuals were identi-\nfied, while an elephant skull fragment, a part of a rib, and fragmented elephant teeth belonging\nto at least two individuals were uncovered in Area C East, Layer 3. Most bones were very frag-\nmented when exposed, thus requiring restoration [36].\nRabinovich and colleagues [36] hypothesized that the great number of large, unidentifiable,\nelephant bone chunks at the site might have resulted from two processes: breakage of long\nbones for marrow extraction [e.g., 40] and/or the production of tools [e.g., 41]. However, bone\ndecomposition might have also occurred due to post-depositional processes.\nCut marks were observed on two ribs and a scapula of a straight-tusked elephant from Area\nB, suggesting that elephants were butchered at the site. Elephant bones shaped as tools were\nalso found, including an elongated wedge-like tool and two bifaces [36]. Based on the lithic\nand faunal assemblages, and supported by the available relative and absolute chronology, the\nentire anthropogenic sequence was assigned to the Late Acheulean of the Levant [33, 36, 42].\nArea C was divided into two sub-areas: C East and C West, located 8 m apart [43] (Fig 1D).\nIn Area C West, covering 33 m\n2\n, five superimposed archaeological layers were exposed, labeled\nC1 to C5, from top to bottom [34]. Layer C3 in Area C West, the layer from which the items\nused in this study were retrieved, is the densest layer at the site, both in terms of flint items and\nanimal bones [42] (Fig 1E).\nFunctional and residue analyses of flint items from Revadim have already provided excep-\ntional results for the reconstruction of the activities performed at the site. Use-wear traces cou-\npled with residues of fat, bone, and collagen fibers found on a conspicuous number of small\nPLOS ONE\nChopping tools from Revadim were used to chop hard and medium materials such as bone\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02455 95 January 19, 2021 3 / 37\nFig 1.

These results provide one of the earliest\ndirect evidences for meat carcass processing and consumption by early humans in the Levant.\nMoreover, fat residues and use-wear traces were also found on a biface and a scraper, found in\nassociation with the remains of a butchered elephant at Layer B2 in Area B [37]. A study\nincluding 176 items from two different areas at the site (B and C) showed that flakes and tools\nwere used equally in both areas, mostly to process soft animal materials, while evidence for the\nprocessing of wood and vegetal resources was also found [46].\nMaterials and methods\nThe archeological context of Layer C3 was chosen due to the excellent preservation of residue\nand good potential for use-wear, as indicated in previous studies [44]. Moreover, we assumed\nthat it would be best to focus our efforts on different lithic components from a specific archae-\nological context in order to reach a better understanding of the different human activities per-\nformed in Layer C3, rather than jumping from one context to another.\nThe methodology applied to the two samples analyzed in this study (chopping tools and\nflake cores) includes several different independent techniques: (1) use-wear analysis, (2)\nmicro-residue analysis by means of optical microscopy, electron microscopy coupled with\nenergy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) microspectro-\nscopy and (3) a typo-technological analysis. Cross-checking the use-wear data with the residue\nresults (conducted and double-checked through two independent spectroscopic techniques,\nFTIR and EDX) greatly increases the reliability of the functional interpretations. Previous use-\nwear and residue for lithic materials from Revadim and the Acheulo-Yabrudian Qesem Cave\n(Israel) have demonstrated the usefulness of the applied methodology and the likelihood of\nfinding informative data in the context discussed here [44, 45, 47].\nMaterials\nOut of the great number of lithic artifacts found in the lithic assemblage of Layer C3 West at\nRevadim, a total of 53 chopping tools and 1,323 cores relevant for this study were classified [48].\nWhile for the purpose of this study we analyzed the entire set of chopping tools retrieved\nfrom Layer C3 (S1 and S2 Figs in S1 File), we performed functional analyses for only a sample\nof flake cores (S3 Fig in S1 File). To select the core sample for this study, we randomly exam-\nined Layer C3 West cores and collected those made on pebbles until we obtained 50 such\nitems. No permits were required for the described study, which complied with all relevant\nregulations.\nChopping tools are defined here as blanks with a central bifacially shaped ridge, often pro-\nduced on pebbles [e.g., 3, 49, 50], following the original definition set by Leakey [19]. It is\nworth mentioning that unifacial chopping tools were not encountered in this assemblage.\nCores are differentiated here from chopping tools mainly by their morphology. Cores lack\nthe central ridge, either bifacial or unifacial, characterizing copping tools. They do have one or\nmore distinctive striking platforms. There is also a clear difference in terms of weight between\nthe groups, with chopping tools being notably heavier, with an average of 100.3 grams for the\nchopping tools (median: 40 grams), compared to an average of 40.6 grams for the cores\n(median: 19.1 grams). A raw materials analysis comparing the flint types used for the produc-\ntion of the two types of artifacts is currently underway.\nWe selected 50 flake cores made on pebbles with one or two platforms. These are consid-\nered as flake cores, bearing at least one striking platform and one production surface, ubiqui-\ntous in the lithic assemblages of Revadim (S3 Fig in S1 File). We focused on cores made on\nPLOS ONE\nChopping tools from Revadim were used to chop hard and medium materials such as bone\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02455 95 January 19, 2021 5 / 37\nflint pebbles, resembling the pebbles used for the shaping of chopping tools. It should be kept\nin mind that in contrast to the volumetric construction of a chopping tool with a bifacial ridge\nrunning at the midline cross-section of the pebble, and no distinct striking platforms or pro-\nduction surfaces, single platform cores are characterized by a clear distinction between these\ntwo surfaces, while their intersection is not located at the midline cross-section of the pebble.\nHowever, one-platform cores might resemble chopping tools in cases in which an acute angle\nis created by the intersection between the striking platform and the production surface. Two-\nplatform cores differ significantly in shape and the use of volume from chopping tools.\nTo the naked eye, the samples appear to be in relatively good condition, with complete out-\nlines and relatively sharp ridges. At low magnification we see that the edges might have been\ndamaged during excavation or by post-depositional weathering [33, 34]. Artifact surfaces\nappear with no particular pronounced smoothness or edge-scarring, suggesting that the items\ndid not suffer strong mechanical stress due to post-depositional processes (except for one\nchopping tool). A geomorphological analysis in Area C showed that the burial of artefacts in\nLayer 3 was relatively rapid and caused by low energy water action [33, 34]. However, the pres-\nence of mostly alkaline water favored the chemical reaction responsible for patina formation.\nIndeed, artefact surfaces exhibited a change in their flint coloration towards brownish/yellow-\nish shading (Fig 2A), while at the microscopic level, chopping tools exhibited a certain degree\nof alteration, resulting in highly reflective surfaces which mostly hampered polish microwear\ncharacterization (Fig 2B).\nDespite of that, sedimentological and micromorphological analyses carried out at Revadim\nrevealed that specific taphonomical conditions including the presence of mostly alkaline water,\nsoil composition, the presence of heavy metal and carbonate, and soil pH, allowed the preserva-\ntion of organic and inorganic residues, notably hydroxyapatite and adipocere [for more details\non taphonomic processes affecting use-wear and residue preservation at Revadim see 44].\nMethods\nTechnological analysis. Chopping tools were divided into four types, as detailed below.\nScars were counted, types of blank were indicated, and the presence of patina differences was\nrecorded. The chopping tools were also measured (length, width and thickness) and were\nFig 2.

In addition, indications concerning the degree of homogeneity, texture and degree of\ntranslucency of the flint were provided. The cores from Revadim were classified by the number\nof striking platforms (1 platform, two platforms, or more than two striking platforms), as well\nas by the applied technological trajectory (prepared cores, flake cores, blade cores). In addition,\nindications were also provided in cases of cores with isolated removals, and for tested cores.\nFor this study we used only flake cores, with one or two striking platforms.\nUse-wear analysis. Use-wear analysis of the archeological and experimental tools was per-\nformed applying low- and high-power approaches [21, 22, 51–56]. Integrating the two meth-\nods allows the identification of use-wear traces at different magnifications. Macro and micro\ntraces were described according to their morphological features. Edge damage was defined by\nthe morphology of the edge scars along with their direction, location and distribution. Edge\nrounding was defined by its degree (low, medium, high).\nPolishes were described according to their texture and topography along with their orienta-\ntion, distribution and degree of rounding, while striations were defined by their morphology,\norientation and location.\nThe archeological samples were first examined by the naked eye and with a Zeiss Discovery\nstereomicroscope with a zoom up to 8x, objective 1x, oculars 10x, and equipped with a LED\nring-light at the Laboratory of Prehistoric Archaeology at Tel Aviv University. During this pre-\nliminary step, the artifacts were fully examined to assess the state of preservation and to iden-\ntify and characterize edge damage and residues associated with use.\nSubsequently, the artifacts were inspected with a Hirox RH-2000 digital microscope cover-\ning a magnification range of 35x-2500x at the Laboratory of Technological and Functional\nAnalyses of Prehistoric Artefacts (LTFAPA) at Sapienza, University of Rome. At this stage the\npresence of morphological residues was noted, recorded, and later double-checked using spec-\ntroscopic techniques. After performing the residue analysis, the archaeological chopping tools\nand cores were observed under high magnification optical light microscopy (OLM) at the Tel\nAviv laboratory using a Zeiss Axio Scope A1 with magnification ranging from 50x to 500x.\nResidue analysis. Residues were first investigated morphologically. Residues identified on\nthe archeological and experimental specimens were characterized and described at low and\nhigh magnification with the Hirox RH-2000 digital microscope and a Hitachi TM3000 scan-\nning electronic microscope according to their appearance, consistency, color, inclusions, bire-\nfringence, and spatial pattern of distribution. The characterized residues were then subjected\nto two-step spectroscopic analysis using the micro-FTIR and SEM-EDX techniques.\nThe micro-FTIR technique was applied using a Bruker Optic Alpha-R portable interferom-\neter with an external reflectance head covering a circular area of about 5 mm in diameter. The\nsamples were placed directly in front of the objective, without preliminary treatments, and dif-\nferent spots were selected for analysis. The investigated spectral range was 7000–375 cm\n−1\nwith\na resolution of 4 cm\n−1\n, and at least 250 scans were performed. Infrared measures were taken\nfrom at least three points from each specimen (proximal, medial, and distal) along the dorsal\nand ventral surfaces according to the used edge, and from at least two points on the inner dor-\nsal and ventral surfaces of each item.\nFourier transform infrared spectroscopy proved to be an effective and reliable technique for\nin-situ residues characterization on archeological and experimental stone tools [57–60].\nDespite of that, caution is needed when ancient residues on lithic tools are analyzed through\nFTIR. Infrared spectra of in-situ archeological residues generally suffer the low intensity of the\nbands of interest and the superimposition of signals produced by the stone reflection (Rest-\nstralhen bands) [57, 59, 61].\nThe energy dispersive X-ray analysis was performed on the chopping tools with a FEG--\nTESCAN-MIRA 3 scanning electron microscope coupled with an EDAX probe at the\nPLOS ONE\nChopping tools from Revadim were used to chop hard and medium materials such as bone\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02455 95 January 19, 2021 7 / 37\nDepartment of Chemical Engineering Materials Environment, Sapienza, University of Rome.\nThe X-ray analysis on one core was performed with a Hitachi TM3000 scanning electron\nmicroscope equipped with a SwiftED3000 probe at the LTFAPA Laboratory, Sapienza, Univer-\nsity of Rome.\nVarious types of signals were used during the analysis of residues: secondary electrons (SE)\nat 5Kv mode were used to characterize topographic and textural traits while the back-scattered\nelectrons (BSE) at 15 Kv mode provided elemental information through grey-scale images\naccording to the atomic number. The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy was performed on\neach identified residue with two or three measurements taken on different spots of the same\nresidue at 15 kV accelerating voltage in BSE mode with a magnification from 100x to 1500x\nand an acquisition time of 400 s.\nThe use of the two techniques allowed to strengthen the integrity of the residues while\nallowing the performance of the measurements directly on the artefact surfaces, without the\nneed of any mechanical or chemical pretreatment of the sample. Moreover, the combined use\nof the two techniques, coupled with the morphological characterization of the residues,\nimproves the reliability of the interpretation, which can be confirmed by cross checking the\nobservations.\nCleaning procedures. Both the archaeological and the experimental specimens were\nobserved before and after the cleaning procedures. The experimental specimens were quickly\nwashed under water after experimental activity and before residue observation. Patches of resi-\ndues were still firmly attached to the lithic surface after this procedure and were morphologi-\ncally and chemically analyzed and recorded. In order to observe the microscopic use-wear, the\nreplicas were placed in a chemical bath starting with diluted 3% acetic acid (CH3COOH) for\n12 min, followed by diluted 3% sodium hydroxide (NaOH) for another 12 min. Finally, the\nobjects were washed with deionized water in an ultrasonic tank for 5 minutes.\nThe archaeological specimens were first observed at low and high magnifications and later\ngently washed in deionized water prior to the use-wear and residue investigation. It should be\nmentioned that the finds were washed in water for cleaning purposes during fieldwork.\nThe specimens that underwent spectroscopic (micro-FTIR) and elemental analyses\n(SEM-EDX) were washed in deionized water in an ultrasonic tank for 5 minutes, allowed to\ndry, and then were sprayed with compressed air just before the analysis. For those specimens\nwith fragile morphological organic residues such as fibers, chemical analyses were performed\nafter a light wash by immersion in deionized water.\nThe artifacts were manually handled when excavated and sorted and were kept in plastic\nbags. After the limited manipulation following the excavation and the sorting procedures, the\nmaterial was stored in separate plastic bags at the storehouse of the Israel Antiquities Authority\nand then at the Prehistoric Archaeology Laboratory at the Institute of Archaeology, Tel Aviv\nUniversity. As previous studies indicated a good likelihood of identifying organic and inor-\nganic residues on the lithic surfaces of artifacts from Area C, Layer 3 of Revadim [see 44], the\ntypo-technological and morphometric analyses of the archaeological materials were performed\nonly after the use-wear and residue analyses were completed. This was to prevent insofar as\npossible any modern contamination of the artifacts during the different stages of the analysis.\nAccording to our methodological protocol, the artifacts were always manipulated with pow-\nder-free sterile gloves during each analytical phase, and a plastic paraffin laboratory film (Par-\nafilm\n1\nM) was used to wrap the modeling clay (Blu-Tack\n1\n), supporting the pieces during the\nobservations. We do wish to stress, however, that contamination from laboratory handling\nduring the analysis cannot be avoided completely [see 62, 63]. Even with the use of latex gloves,\ninvisible particles of dirt stay attached to the rubber glove and be transferred to on the artefact\nsurfaces during laboratory manipulation. Thus, the importance of distinguishing non-use\nPLOS ONE\nChopping tools from Revadim were used to chop hard and medium materials such as bone\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02455 95 January 19, 2021 8 / 37\ncontaminant residues (such as micro skin flakes or micro modern dirty particles) [64] on the\narchaeological artifacts is paramount. Additionally, the integrated approach of different inde-\npendent techniques presented here constitutes a valid and reliable method to successfully over-\ncome the problem, providing reliable functional interpretations.\nThe experimental reference collection. Use-wear evidence and residues found on the\narchaeological specimens were compared to wear traces and residues observed on the replicas\nused during the chopping experiments. A comparison between archaeological and experimen-\ntal use-wear and residue was also conducted [21–22, 44, 47, 58, 60, 62, 65–68].\nThe use-wear and residues results observed on the experimental replica are discussed in the\nS1 File, while a reference collection for chemical measurements using micro-FTIR and\nSEM-EDX of bone and other animal residues was prepared prior to this study. The results are\navailable in 44, 47, while other comparisons can be found in the available literature [57–58, 62,\n68, 69–74].\nReplica of chopping tools were produced from unmodified pebbles, resembling the archeo-\nlogical chopping tools in size, shape and texture. These pebbles were collected at the vicinity of\nRevadim. Following the results obtained from the archaeological specimens (see below), the\nexperimental items were used for bone processing, and specifically for chopping activities\naimed at opening bones for marrow acquisition.\nThe experimental replicas were observed at the LTFAPA Laboratory with a Nikon Eclipse met-\nallurgical microscope with magnification up to 500x. The replicas were examined on molds made\nwith Provil Novo Light Fast Heraeus\n1\n[see 75], while for the SEM analysis resin casts were made\nfrom these molds using the epoxy adhesive Araldite\n1\nLY 554 plus hardener HY 956 [see 76].\nExperimental trials\nAfter a preliminary observation of the archeological chopping tools, we noticed that most of\nthe items exhibit a specific type of edge damage, along with some edge rounding, both associ-\nated with chopping activities. The animal residues observed are also associated with these\nactivities. Thus, a series of experiments was conducted in order to test the hypothesis that the\nRevadim chopping tools were used to chop bone for marrow extraction, as proposed by Kee-\nley, Semenov, Toth and others based on their replication experiments and the results of their\nmicrowear analyses of Lower Paleolithic chopper-cores [13, 21, 22, 27, 28, 30, 31, 77, 78].\nThe goal of the experiments was to test the efficiency of the chopping tool replicas in break-\ning open bones while creating microwear traces and residues that could be compared with the\nwear traces and residues observed on archeological chopping tools from Revadim.\nSince the archeological chopping tools vary greatly in size, we replicated and tested small\n(weight < 50gr), medium (weigh < 120gr), and large tools (weight > 150gr). These were\nknapped from flint pebbles recovered from the site of Revadim and its vicinity by direct per-\ncussion, using a hard hammerstone (S3 and S4 Figs in the S1 File).\nWe performed seven experiments testing different combinations of variables: bones from\ndifferent animals, different bone sizes, and different states of bone preservation to test the\nworkability of the bones in different degrees of freshness. One chopping tool was also buried\nafter use in order to record the morphological modification of residues after two months of\ninterment (Table 1). We want to stress here that our experiments should not be regarded as a\nreconstruction of bone breakage activities conducted on-site but rather as an investigation\ninto the applicability of chopping tools in breaking open bones. The inclusion of bones in dif-\nferent states of freshness and different sizes in the experimental reference collection allowed us\nto test and better understand the efficiency of chopping tools under different situations and\nconditions.\nPLOS ONE\nChopping tools from Revadim were used to chop hard and medium materials such as bone\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02455 95 January 19, 2021 9 / 37\nThe experiments included chopping activities on fore and hind leg bones of small, medium\nand large animals (a roe deer, a pig, and a cow), since the marrow adipose tissue (MAT) is pre-\ndominant in these skeleton parts [79]. Bones were processed in two conditions: 1) still covered\nby fat, muscular tissues, cartilage and tendons, and 2) after a cleaning procedure for removing\nmeat, cartilage, and the periosteum membrane (S6 Fig in S1 File).\nWe tested fresh bones, processed soon after butchery, dehydrated bones (retrieved from a\nraw ham, the Italian prosciutto crudo) that underwent an air-drying process assisted by venti-\nlation under moisture-controlled conditions, and a completely desiccated bone (Fig 3C and\n3I). A flat stone and a wooden support were chosen as an anvil in order to maintain the bones\nin balance during all the experiments; however, the chopping tools themselves did not come in\ncontact with these supports during the activities.\nBone is generally considered a hard animal material, but hardness may vary depending on the\nstate of preservation and the size of the individual bone. We noticed that fresh bones of large ani-\nmals, such as femurs and tibias of bovine are thick, dense, elastic and hard to break. In contrast,\nthe dehydrated pig bones were easier to break because of the aging process, mandatory for the\nproduction of raw ham. This process causes consistent water loss within the tissues (bone and\nmeat lose up to 8% of their weight). This results in a thinner, softer, and less elastic bony matrix,\nbut allows, at the same time, the preservation of edible marrow and a semi-dry and frayed consis-\ntency of the attached fleshy and connective tissues [see 80 for an overview of marrow preservation\nin bones; S5 and S6 Figs in S1 File]. This experiment provided us with a glimpse into similar situa-\ntions of partial dehydration of animal tissues, which may occur under particular conditions of\ntemperature, moisture, and ventilation in butchery localities (for example, when carcasses exposed\nto the open air are exploited only several days after the animal’s death).\nConcerning the workability of the bones, at least 60 strokes were needed to affect the dehy-\ndrated medium-sized pig bones, and more than 300 strokes all around the bone shaft circum-\nference were required to break the bones in half to access the marrow (S5C Fig in S1 File).\nMarrow was collected from several small, fresh bones of a roe deer after performing a few\nblows (S5A Fig in S1 File). Large fresh bovine bones were, in contrast, hard to break, and the\nmarrow was accessed through a large, deep groove (S5B Fig in S1 File).\nThe complete dry bone could not be broken with our experimental tools (Fig 3D).\nClearly, successful bone breakage and the number of strokes required are influenced by sev-\neral variables, including: 1) the applied force and pressure during the hit, and 2) the\nTable 1.

The data reported here refer to experiments performed by a young female adult (F.V.)\nand an adult male, while for each experiment the most appropriate chopping tools for the type\nand size of the bones were chosen.\nDuring the experiments, we noticed that it is difficult to chop through thick cylindrical\nbone shafts with tools that have steep and sharp cutting edges. It is easier in this case to cut it\nalong its transverse axis. A series of several cuts are adequate to split bones of small to medium\ndimension but insufficient to open large and heavy bones in order to collect the marrow. In\nthat case, tools such as shaped stone balls (polyhedrons/spheroids, usually much heavier than\nthe chopping tools, often made of limestone and bearing massive ridges), which make contact\nwith a large area of the bone, allow the force to spread over a large extent of the surface. This\nmakes it possible to split large bones and extract the bone marrow in perfect condition [81].\nAs a rule, we noticed that it is preferable to remove fat, cartilage and periosteum membrane\nfrom the bone prior to the breakage attempt, especially if these materials are found in abun-\ndance. This facilitates bone breakage, as the adhesion between the stone cutting edge and the\nbone surface is optimal. As a general impression, we found the chopping tools efficient for\nchopping bone as long as their morphometric traits (weight, size, shape, and edge morphol-\nogy) are suited to the physical characteristics of the worked materials.\nOur observations and the results obtained from the microscopic examination of the chop-\nping tools replica match the pioneering experimental works made by Keeley, Semenov and\nToth [21, 22, 30, 31].\nResults\nTechnological analysis of the chopping tools\nAll chopping tools included in this study bear a bifacial central ridge. Most of the chopping\ntools (n = 48; 90.6%) are characterized by an unmodified base, still completely covered with\ncortex. The chopping tools were sub-divided into four types:\n• Type 1 –chopping tools made on flat and thin pebbles, with partial bifacial knapping, only\non the two sides of the ridge, with an unmodified base. Most of the cortex is still preserved.\nThis group comprises almost half of the tools in the chopping category (n = 25; 47.2%) (Fig\n4A).\n• Type 2 –chopping tools made on thick rounded pebbles, with partial, more invasive bifacial\nknapping, mainly along the bifacial ridge. The bases are unmodified. Most of the cortex is\nstill preserved (n = 16; 30.2%) (Fig 4B).\n• Type 3 –chopping tools made on thick amorphous pebbles/nodules, with invasive bifacial\nknapping. Their bases are unmodified. Most of the cortex is still preserved (n = 9; 17.0%)\n(Fig 4C).\n• Type 4 –Irregular chopping tools, which do not meet the criteria for any of the other types\n(n = 3; 5.7%) (Fig 4D).\nFig 3.

Type 1 is dominated by homogenous fine-textured\nflint types (n = 16; 60.9%), while the flint types used in Types 2, 3 and 4 tends to be more\nheterogenous and coarser. Chopping tools from Type 1 are significantly lighter (47.4 grams on\naverage; median: 32 grams) than those in the other types (146.25 grams on average, excluding\nType 1; median: 60 grams). Chopping tools of Type 1 are also shorter (4.14 cm on average)\n(Fig 5).\nChopping tools are characterized by an average of 6.9 flake scars forming the bifacial ridge.\nType 4 presents the highest average of scars (8.66 scars). The three other types are more consis-\ntent, with an average of between 6.38 and 6.67 scars per chopper (S1 Table in S1 File).\nUse wear analysis of chopping tools\nOf the chopping tools, 41% (22 out of 53 specimens) have visible diagnostic microwear traces,\nwhile 19 (36%) do not. The 12 other tools (23%) had only weak generic unreliable use wear\ntraces and were considered as non-diagnostic (Table 2)\nOut of the 22 items with use-wear, 17 specimens were interpreted as having been used in\nchopping activities on medium to hard materials. Specific areas of the outer edges of these\ntools were worn, rounded, and scarred. Edge damage is represented by: 1) fracturing of the\nedge (Fig 6A and 6B); 2) micro-crushing and rounding of the edge and/or edge asperities (Fig\n6D and 6F); 3) micro-compressions of the outer edge appearing at high magnifications with\npronounced rounding (Fig 6C); 4) overlapped deep hinge or step scars (Fig 6E).

Edge dam-\nage is characterized mostly by step and hinge transversal scars (occasionally overlapped) dis-\ntributed along the active edge. Edge rounding is always pronounced.\nOnly one chopping tool (CT#42 AR15b 71.16–06) in the entire sample was used to cut or\ngrave medium material while a large fracture on the active edge of item CT#18 AR18 71.12–00\nwhich probably occurred during use, may have removed the use wear traces.\nA detailed microscopic observation including polish characterization were possible on item\nCT#10 AR15d 71.18–17 showing better preserved lithic surfaces. A bright, domed, rough to\nsmooth bone microwear was identified (Fig 7C).\nOur experiments showed that it is hard to reproduce and identify prehension traces on the\nparts of the chopper-cores that are covered with cortex. These are the areas that probably were\nheld in hand when the tools were used. Prehension traces were only visible on item CT#3\nAS15c 71.14–12, a borderline case that could be classified as a chopping tool or a core (Fig\n8A). The almost complete absence of cortex allowed the identification of a series of overlapped\ntiny feather and hinge scars with a close regular distribution, that were interpreted as prehen-\nsion traces (Fig 8D).\nFig 6.

These residues exhibited, in\nsome cases, yellowish amorphous or rounded structures embedded inside, with a glossy and\ngreasy appearance (Fig 9A–9D). Crystalline white masses interpreted as bony tissues were also\nobserved on one specimen along with a smeared mass of birefringent bluish fat droplets on the\nactive edge of the same artefact (Fig 9E–9F). These residues fill the deep micro-depressions\nand the use-edge scars or they are smeared on the lithic surface just below the edge or several\nmillimeters from it.\nFig 8.

The whitish/yellowish patches of resi-\ndues appeared at the scanning electron microscope with light and bright tonalities, standing\nout from the darker grey color of the flint substrate. They are compact/dense with a flat and\nregular topography (Fig 10B), but they also appear in powdery consistency. Residues are\nsmeared in the micro-cavities of the lithic surfaces or embedded in tool’s scars (Fig 10E). The\nEDX measurement showed that residues are composed of major concentration of Ca, P and\nminor concentration of Al and Si (related to flint substrate) along with the stable C and O (Fig\n10C and 10F).\nBy comparing the proportion between the detected elements, Ca and P always occurred at a\nstable ratio approximately equal to 2:1.\nMicro-FTIR analysis was performed on 11 tools. All the micro-FTIR spectra show the very\nintense band at 1157 cm\n−1\n(Si-O stretching mode) and less intense bands at 469 and 798 cm\n−1\nTable 3.

Two tools displayed the presence of a doublet at the frequency of 1575/1536 cm\n-1\nattributable to the stretching mode of fatty acid salts along with the C-H stretching vibrations\nof organic components detected in the range of 3000–2800 cm\n-1\n(Fig 12 blue spectrum).

The integration of three different levels of analysis\nfor the investigation of residues (morphological, elemental and chemical) allowed to confi-\ndently interpret the residues as micro-remains of bone.\nBone consists in an organic component called collagen and an inorganic mineral compo-\nnent called hydroxyapatite with a chemical formula Ca\n5\n(PO\n4\n)\n3\n(OH). The major minerals in\nbone tissues are calcium and phosphorous and the most characteristic elemental signature of\nbone is the calcium-phosphorus (Ca/P) ratio. Stoichiometric hydroxyapatite has been reported\nwith a Ca/P ratio of 2.15 while modern powdered cortical bone has a mean of 1.88 with a\nFig 10.

The variation in the Ca/P ratio also depends on the bone types and the\nanimal species analyzed [89].\nFew archeological studies dealing with EDX measurements on residue characterization dis-\ncuss the Ca/P atomic ratio of bone. Hayes and Rots [62] reported this ratio as Ca:P = 3:1 while\nChristensen [90] described the values equal to Ca:P = 2:1. In our EDX measurements, bone\nmineral Ca/P ratio always lies between 1.8 and 2.0 according to the weight percentage values.\nAlthough bone residues show, in some cases, similarity with calcite accumulation when\nobserved at the optical light microscopes (smeared patches of whitish accumulation, with an\nopaque aspect and transparent at high magnification), the two residues cannot be confused\nwhen a SEM-EDX analysis is performed. Calcite residues, which are also observed on Revadim\nsamples and can be clearly interpreted as calcium accumulation, displayed a grainy topography\nunder the SEM and their elemental composition is characterized by an overrepresentation of\ncalcium in comparison to the other elements. Although less concentration of phosphorus\nmight be found in calcite residues, the Ca/P was never recorded at the proper ratio (S7 Fig in\nS1 File).\nThe proposed interpretation for bone residues was further supported by FTIR analysis.\nIn the bone in-situ residues, the most intense peak of hydroxyapatite unfortunately lies\naround 1030 cm\n-1\n, overlapping the Si-O stretching mode of silica. However, the presence of\nbone produces a broadening at the lower frequency side of this mode and, in addition, a shoul-\nder around 913 cm\n-1\n. The peak at 913 cm\n-1\nis also observed on the spectrum of pure bone (Fig\n11, brown spectrum).\nOrganic components of bone such as collagen and spectroscopically assigned to amide I,\namide II, C-H scissoring vibration of CH\n2\nand CH\n3\n, and Amide III [58, 71–73, 91] were\nobserved only in the 1700–1300 cm\n-1\nrange of the bone sample spectrum. The presence of cal-\ncium and phosphorus in a proper ratio (~2:1) in all the specimens that also showed the IR\npeak at 913 cm\n-1\nmakes the spectroscopic assignments fully reliable.\nFor the two chopping tools showing the doublet 1573/1537 cm\n-1\n, we propose their assign-\nment to adipocere, whose formation is due to the hydrolysis and hydrogenation of fatty tissues\ninto a mixture of predominantly fatty acids as myristic, palmitic and stearic acids [92, 93]. The\nrelative amount of these acids depends on the nature of the soil in which adipocere has formed\n[94]. Adipocere is a soap-like product containing the salts of mentioned acids, not soluble in\nwater and able to invisibly fill the micro-holes of the microcrystalline of flint stone surviving\nfor centuries. It should be noted that the doublet is present in the spectra of the mentioned\nacids and their salts along with other peaks [Fig 12 red spectrum, i.e. around 1740 cm\n-1\nand in\nthe 1500–1400 cm\n-1\ninterval, see 95], whose intensity decreases until disappearance when the\namount of salts increase, leaving the doublet at 1573/1537 cm\n-1\nas the most intense IR spectro-\nscopic feature (Fig 12 blue spectrum) [96]. While for bone residues it was possible to cross-\nchecking the FTIR results with their morphological and elemental characterization, the inter-\npretation of adipocere only relies on the results of the infra-red analysis. Thus, more caution is\nneeded in regards to its assignation, notwithstanding the good match between the experimen-\ntal and the archeological results.\nThe case of CT#2 AP14c 71.13–08, deserves a separate discussion. Yellow-brownish micro-\nparticles, with a glossy and greasy appearance were found with micro-residues detected\nthrough both SEM-EDX and FTIR and interpreted as bone in a central edge scar (Fig 13B area\n2 and Fig 13F).\nResidues are embedded in the lithic surface and look dense and opaque but with a translu-\ncent aspect if imaged at high magnifications (Fig 10A–10D). Some of these particles appear\nwhitish and gradually change their shades into yellowish coloration. Morphologically (i.e., in\nterms of appearance, consistency, color, opacity, and transparency), these micro residues show\nPLOS ONE\nChopping tools from Revadim were used to chop hard and medium materials such as bone\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02455 95 January 19, 2021 24 / 37\nFig 13.

The topo-\ngraphical and elemental characterization by SEM-EDX analysis suggests an organic fatty origin\nfor those residues, which was confirmed by the lack of additional compositional elements\nother than C, O, Si, Al. (Fig 10B, area 1). Fat tissues are basically composed of carbon and oxy-\ngen (the stable compound common in all organic and inorganic matters), along with hydro-\ngen, where hydrogen is invisible to X-ray because of its atomic number (<5) [97]. As a\nconsequence, the spectrum shows the compositional elements of fat (C, O) and of the rock\nsubstrate (C, O, Si, Al).\nWe exclude the possibility of interpreting the residues as modern contamination or sedi-\nment accumulation because they did no show the topographical traits of modern contami-\nnants and because, if that had been the case, we would expect the residues to be composed of\nadditional elements such as S, Na, Cl, Ka and Ca [64].\nUse wear and residue analysis of cores\nOnly four out of the 50 selected cores (8%) displayed traces related to use, mainly chopping\nand scraping activities on medium and hard materials. Edge damage is consistent with edge\nscarring and edge rounding found on the chopping tools samples (Table 4).\nMorphological micro-residues were only observed on one core (#23 AQ15b 71.14–71.10),\nwhich resembles a chopping tool but without a clear central bifacial ridge at the intersection\nbetween the two faces of the pebble (Fig 14A). The used edge corresponds to the linear portion\nof its ridge, which displays overlapped step scars with a medium degree of rounding (Fig 14B).\nAlong the used edge (Fig 14C, red square) and to a distance of few millimeters from it (Fig\n14D, green square), we observed several groups of thin, long, round and flat fibers, transparent\nand birefringent, perpendicularly oriented, clumped together and firmly stuck on the lithic\nsurface inside the micro-depression of the flint surface. Particularly noteworthy is a well-\ndefined, twisted, long fiber, appearing flat and light brown in color, blended in a whitish mass\nof residue (grainy in texture), along with other groups of fibers with a clear transversal direc-\ntionality (Fig 14D and 14E).

The\nstronger absorption at ~1521 cm\n-1\nmade it possible to classify the residue as sparitic calcite.\nDue to its large dimensions, the specimen could not be placed in the SEM chamber to double-\ncheck the presence of bone micro-residue. We therefore decided to mechanically extract a sample\nof fibers and mount them on an aluminum stab covered by carbon film in order to observe their\ntopographical characteristics. Fibers appeared at 5Kv mode both round and flat in shape and\nlargely scattered by a veil of substance formed by geometrical small grains (Fig 14F). The fibers\nappeared dark grey in color while the grains are white; the color assignments were obtained in\naccordance with the atomic number using the secondary electron detector. The elemental analysis\n(EDX) of the fiber itself showed that it is composed of high concentrations of Si and Al along with\nlow presence of Mg, P, S, Cl, Fe and Ca with the stable carbon-oxygen compound (Fig 14F). In\ncontrast, measurements taken on the substance on top of them revealed high concentrations of\nCa and Al and Si and a low percentage of P and Fe along with C and O (Fig 14F).\nBased on these observations, we interpret the residue as ancient. Abundant concentrations\nof Si and Al were already noted as a constant in other measurements taken on residues from\nRevadim and were also recorded in measurements performed on a sample of bones retrieved\nfrom Layer C3. Thus, we believe that these two chemical elements—along with the high con-\ncentrations of calcium in this specific case—are associated with the taphonomical processes\nthat affected the site during the burial period, although some small percentage of these three\nelements might be part of the fibers themselves.\nThat said, the information available so far does not allow us to specifically characterize the\norigin of the fibers. In the absence of reliable results from the spectroscopic analyses, the mor-\nphological characterization alone is not sufficient to confidently determine whether the fibers\nare of animal or vegetal origin. However, given the presence of bone detected by FTIR analysis,\nwe prefer to interpret the core as having been used for chopping activity on a medium-to-hard\nmaterial of animal origin as the more likely explanation.\nDiscussion\nThe majority of the Revadim chopping tools follow the formal definition of these items (Types\n1 and 2 in this study) as described by Movius [20] and Leakey [19]. These are usually oval in\ngeneral shape, characterized by an unmodified base, with most of the cortex still preserved and\na partial or invasive bifacially flaked single ridge resulting in a pointed or sinuous cutting-edge.\nA few other chopping tools, produced on thick amorphous nodules or flint blocks, were\nassigned to Type 3. Finally, Type 4 includes three artifacts that were produced on irregular\nnodules and do not correspond to any of the three other types.\nOur view that these were designated, pre-planned tools rather than cores is supported by\nthe partial exploitation of the pebble, as indicated by the average of seven scars per chopping\ntool along with the extensive cortical coverage. The low degree of reduction and exploitation\nsupports a scenario in which the main goal was not flake production but rather the shaping of\na sharp and solid bifacial ridge on a cortical pebble. The cortex cover might have been inten-\ntionally left intact to allow a firm grip while working with the tool [98–104]. The fact that\nmany of these chopping tools were minimally flaked on one end of the pebble only, leaving\nmost of the mass and volume of the pebble untouched, might further contradict the identifica-\ntion of these artifacts as cores. If flake production was the primary goal of removing flakes\non the whitish residues (red) and micro-re sidue of bone detected along the edge and close to the area of fibers (blue and green). Black spectru m shows a spot without\nresidues. Red and green dots show the location of fibers, dotted line indicates the functio nal area.\nhttps://doi.org/10 .1371/journal.p one.0245595. g014\nPLOS ONE\nChopping tools from Revadim were used to chop hard and medium materials such as bone\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02455 95 January 19, 2021 28 / 37\nfrom a pebble, we would have expected more flakes to have been detached, as in the case of the\npebble cores. What we see instead is only minimal modification of one end of the pebble,\nwhich was then discarded as such. Moreover, the bifacial shaping of the pebble is aimed at pro-\nducing a robust and regular sharp edge in the case of the chopping tools, which is lacking in\nthe group of the pebble cores. Notwithstanding the role of technological needs, the knapper’s\npersonal skills, and the availability of flint around the site which might have played a role in\nthe intensity of the reduction, it is our contention that the morphology of these artifacts and\ntheir volume, combined with the use-wear results presented here and the small number of\nflakes removed from these chopping tools, all further demonstrate that most of these artifacts\nare in fact the intended tool, rather than cores.\nThe use-wear analysis coupled with the residue examination proved that the majority of\nchopping tools at Revadim Layer C3 were used in chopping activities involving the processing\nof medium and hard materials with direct evidence of bone processing (Table 5; S8 and S9\nFigs in S1 File).\nPercussion damage and residue patterns demonstrate a direct and clear correspondence of\nmost of the chopping tools with this type of activity. Although pounding activities on bone\nmight also be performed using other types of tools, Layer C3 lacks other core-tool forms such\nas polyhedrons or spheroids useful for this type of activity [81], notwithstanding the fact that\nsimple unmodified cobbles or hammerstones could have also been used as complementary\nitems for this kind of task, as shown in our experimental trials (S10 Fig in S1 File). Chopping\ntools might have served as one component of a tool-kit oriented towards the extraction of\nbone marrow, used primarily as sharp-edged chopping tools aimed at fracturing the bone in\norder to facilitate and guide subsequent blows, conducted by a more massive percussor. In the\ncase of the chopping tools, it seems that the bifacial ridge was the major element enabling effi-\ncient bone fracturing for marrow extraction. Unmodified stones lack such an element and\nthus do not enable an efficient and accurate execution of blows aimed at the breakage of\nbones. However, chopping tools, massive cobbles and hammerstones could have all been used\nin tandem to break long bones and expose marrow at Revadim.\nBy cross-checking the typo-technological data with the use-wear and residue interpretation,\nwe observed that most of the chopping tools used to perform bone-smashing activities in\nLayer C3 are of medium dimension, measuring 5 cm in width on average and 50 grams in\nweight (n = 8), except for three larger and more massive items. The general morphology of\ntheir used-edge portions ranges from straight to semi-pointed, with steep or obtuse edge-\nangles ranging between 60 to 90 degrees. Our experiments showed that pointed extremities of\nthe edge are preferable for percussive activities, while straight edges allow better control over\nthe motion. The results of our experiments suggest a link between the morphometric features\nof the chopping tools and the physical characteristics of the worked material, which must have\nplayed a fundamental role in the successful outcome of the bone-chopping activity.\nTable 5.

According to ergonomic\nstudies applied to archeological lithic artifacts, the size of the worked material is directly pro-\nportional to the size of the tool and, therefore, to the load/force applied by the tool [105–107].\nAs proof of this, longitudinal and transversal motions, which do not require a heavy loading\nforce, were performed with the smallest (3 cm in length on average) and lightest (20 grams on\naverage) chopping tools, among all those exhibiting use-wear traces. These data provide indi-\nrect evidence of the size of the animals processed using the chopping tools from Layer C3, in\nthe absence of direct faunal analysis in this specific layer. The faunal assemblage unearthed in\nRevadim in different areas includes bovids, cervids, wild boar, equids, and elephants, among\nother species [33, 36]. Since chopping tools at Layer C3 range in size and weight, we can specu-\nlate that the more massive chopping tools were used to process medium to large bones of\nbovids or cervids (which are present at Revadim), but it seems rather unlikely that large bones\nsuch as those of elephants found in Layer C3 could have been processed with the chopping\ntools unearthed in this area.\nExcluding one very large and heavy (600 grams) specimen interpreted as having been used\nin chopping a medium to hard material (possibly bone), the remaining specimens are of\nmedium to small dimensions with rather short and limited cutting edges. Thus, they might\nhave been used to break the bones of medium to small animals and/or used to treat parts or\nfragments of bones of large mammals, such as elephants. The very fragmented character of the\nbones in Layer C3 might support this interpretation, although taphonomical processes may\nhave contributed to this fragmentation [36].\nMoreover, the state of freshness of the worked material might have also affected the success-\nful chopping of large bones. We verified that bones in a semi-fresh/dehydrate d state of preser-\nvation are easier to break also when using tools lighter and smaller than the bone itself. That\nmeans that larger bones in a semi-fresh state could have been processed with chopping tools\nwhich do not necessarily exhibit suitable morphological characteristics.\nUnfortunately, no specific patterns of residue and edge damage morphology or distribution\nwere identified as a proxy to infer the timing of access to the carcass, discriminating between\nfresh and semi-fresh carcass processing. However, we cannot rule out the hypothesis that the\nRevadim hominins might have implemented both immediate- and delayed-return strategies\non animal carcasses such as consumption on-site and drying meat and bone for later con-\nsumption, as suggested by Rabinovich and colleagues [36]. This can be explained by the need\nto cope with the consumption of large quantities of meat, hide, bone, and fats, as in the case of\nlarge animals such as elephants. Unbroken bone marrow can indeed persist in a fresh state for\nseveral days in medium to large bones without being subjected to microbial attack [108]. Sup-\nporting this scenario, to some extent, is the seemingly absence of upper and lower elephant\nlimb bones at Revadim, which are the richest in terms of fat and nutrients (one should keep in\nmind, however, that these limb bones might have been the first to be fractured and thus are\nunderrepresented as complete items but rather by the ubiquitous bone-chunks). Also, limb\nbones might have been removed and consumed elsewhere [36]. Moreover, the co-occurrence\nof cut marks and carnivore gnawing marks in Area B may indicate a complex scenario in\nwhich groups of early humans processed and consumed meat and fat at different times, while\nat other times some of the animal parts were also available for carnivores.\nDelayed-return activities aimed at preserving bones for future marrow extraction is another\nfeasible possibility, in light of the recently presented evidence from Qesem cave [80].\nWe would like to stress that, while further delayed butchery experiments coupled with cut-\nmark analysis in Layer C3 are required to shed light on the ongoing debate concerning hunting\nPLOS ONE\nChopping tools from Revadim were used to chop hard and medium materials such as bone\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02455 95 January 19, 2021 30 / 37\nversus scavenging in the Acheulean, recent studies repeatedly support a scenario of active\nhunting performed by Paleolithic groups [109–111].\nOur data also contribute to the discussion regarding another hotly debated yet unresolved\ntopic: the function of chopping tools in Lower Paleolithic assemblages. Were these expressly\nproduced to be used as tools, are they exploited cores aimed at the production of flakes or they\nshould be considered as core-tools? Our results demonstrate that many of the chopping tools\nwere used for targeted tasks, namely chopping hard materials, and specifically bone. In most\ncases, chopping tools exhibit minimal flaking (less than seven scars); the flake production\npotential of each pebble was clearly not fully exploited. We therefore believe that chopping\ntools were the desired end-products of this line of production, designed to fulfill a specific\nfunction. We cannot, however, exclude a scenario in which used and unused chopping tools\nalso served as a source for flakes to be produced in times of need. As an example, item #52\nAQ17c 71.03–70.01 exhibits patina differentiation in scar color and texture, testifying to its\nlater exploitation as a core. Similar suggestions were also made by Zupancich and colleagues\nconcerning a chopper found in Area B in Revadim [46]. Following the same reasoning, cores\nwere also used, albeit rarely, for heavy-duty tasks when their morphology suited for the task at\nhand, thus emphasizing the grey zone between the two categories and the flexibility of core-\ntools form during the late Acheulean. Based on these findings we prefer to define the Revadim\nitems as chopping tools instead of chopper-cores, notwithstanding their potential double func-\ntion of being tools and cores at the same time.\nConclusions\nCombining different approaches and techniques, we present the first comprehensive set of\nresults concerning the role of chopping tools in Late Acheulean Revadim. The rich lithic\nassemblage and the exceptional preservation of residues at Layer C3 provide important\ninsights for the reconstruction of the activities carried out by the Revadim hominins. We have\ndemonstrated that chopping tools were used to perform heavy-duty chopping/breaking tasks\nthrough percussion activities with direct evidence for bone processing, most probably for mar-\nrow acquisition. The fact that few such items were also used to cut and scrape animal matters\nreveals the probable multi-purpose potential of this category of tools, also reflected by their\nbeing a potential source for usable flakes (S11 Fig in S1 File). This also demonstrates the flexi-\nbility of the Revadim hominins in functional decision-making.\nThis study adds yet another piece to the puzzle of activities performed at Revadim, contrib-\nuting to our knowledge of the different phases of animal carcass exploitation at the site. Thus\nfar, the functional analysis of several lithic artifacts at the site proves that Revadim hominins\nwere able to conceive a wide range of tools with distinct morphological characteristics (heavy-\nand light-duty tools) and employ them to obtain food (e.g., meat, fat, brain, marrow) and, per-\nhaps, other useful materials from animal prey [37, 44–46].\nThese findings indicate that Revadim hominins could produce and use varied tool-types\nwith appropriate functional characteristics, highlighting their resourcefulness in functional\ndecision-making [37, 44, 46]. Moreover, the co-occurrence of simple forms such as chopping\ntools, along with more complex items in Layer C3 (i.e., bifaces), demonstrates the cultural vari-\nability and behavioral flexibility expressed by the Revadim toolmakers in conceiving their\nheavy-duty tool-kit. These findings shed new light on the cognitive adaptability and technolog-\nical realm of Late Acheulean hominins in the Levant at the end of the Lower Paleolithic.\nIn a more general perspective, our results show the potential of studying the function of\nsuch ancient tools, also assisting researchers in reconstructing the role of chopping tools/chop-\npers in Lower Paleolithic human adaptation strategies.\nPLOS ONE\nChopping tools from Revadim were used to chop hard and medium materials such as bone\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02455 95 January 19, 2021 31 / 37\nSupporting information\nS1 File.\n(DOCX)\nAcknowledgmen ts\nFV is grateful to Cristina Lemorini for her availability to discuss the results of this study and to\nRuth Shahack-Gross for providing information on the IR analysis of layer C3.
