Among these errors, misspelling a character\nfrequently occurs due to the similarity between\ncharacters. In Chinese, many characters are phono-\nlogically and visually similar, but semantically very\ndifferent. According to Liu et al. (2010), about\n83% of errors are related to phonological similarity\nand 48% are related to visual similarity. The Chi-\nnese Spelling Check (CSC) task aims to detect and\ncorrect such misuse of the Chinese language. De-\nspite recent development, CSC remains a challeng-\ning task. Notably, the spelling checking on Chinese\nis very different from English, due to its language\n∗Equal contribution.\n1The dataset and all code for this paper is available at\nhttps://github.com/ACL2020SpellGCN/SpellGCN\nInput 餐厅的换经费产适合约会\n(phonics) c¯an t¯ing d¯e hu`an j¯ing f`ei ch´an sh`ı h´e yu¯e hu`ı\nBERT 餐厅的月消费最适合约会\n(phonics) c¯an t¯ing d¯e yu`e xi¯ao f`ei zu`ı sh`ı h´e yu¯e hu`ı\n+SpellGCN 餐厅的环境非常适合约会\n(phonics) c¯an t¯ing d¯e hu´an j`ıng f¯ei ch´ang sh`ı h´e yu¯e hu`ı\nTable 1: A CSC data sample from SIGHAN 2014 (Yu\net al., 2014) with ID B1-3440-2, the incorrect/correct\ncharacters are in orange/blue.

The sentence output from SpellGCN means\n“this restaurant is very suitable for dating”.\nnature. Chinese is a language consisting of many\npictographic characters without word delimiters.\nAnd the meaning of each character changes dramat-\nically when the context changes. Therefore, a CSC\nsystem needs to recognize the semantics and ag-\ngregate the surrounding information for necessary\nmodiﬁcations.\nPrevious methods followed the line of generative\nmodels. They used either language models (Liu\net al., 2013, 2010; Yu and Li, 2014) or sequence-\nto-sequence models (Wang et al., 2019). To fuse\nthe external knowledge of the similarity between\ncharacters, some of them leveraged a confusion set,\nwhich contains a set of similar character pairs. For\ninstance, Yu and Li (2014) proposed to produce\nseveral candidates by retrieving the confusion set\nand then ﬁlter them via language models. Wang\net al. (2019) used a pointer network to copy a simi-\nlar character from the confusion set. These meth-\nods attempted to utilize the similarity information\nto conﬁne the candidates, rather than modeling the\nrelationship between characters explicitly.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel spelling check\narXiv:2004.14166v2  [cs.CL]  13 May 2020\nconvolutional graph network (SpellGCN) that cap-\ntures the pronunciation/shape similarity and ex-\nplore the prior dependencies between characters.\nSpeciﬁcally, two similarity graphs are constructed\nfor the pronunciation and shape relationship cor-\nrespondingly. SpellGCN takes the graphs as input\nand generates for each character a vector represen-\ntation after the interaction between similar charac-\nters. These representations are then constructed\ninto a character classiﬁer for the semantic repre-\nsentation extracted from another backbone module.\nWe use BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) due to its pow-\nerful semantic capacity. Combining the graph rep-\nresentations with BERT, SpellGCN can leverage\nthe similarity knowledge and generate the right cor-\nrections accordingly. Regarding the example as in\nTable 1, SpellGCN is able to modify the sentence\ncorrectly within the pronunciation constraint.\nExperiments were conducted on three open\nbenchmarks. The results demonstrate that Spell-\nGCN improves BERT evidently, outperforming all\ncompetitor models by a large margin.\nIn summary, our contributions are as follows:\n•We propose a novel end-to-end trainable Spell-\nGCN to integrate the pronunciation and shape\nsimilarities into the semantic space. Its essen-\ntial components such as the specialized graph\nconvolution and attentive combination opera-\ntions are carefully investigated.\n•We investigate the performance of SpellGCN\nboth quantitatively and qualitatively. Ex-\nperimental results indicate that our method\nachieves the best results on three benchmark\ndatasets.\n2 Related Work\nThe CSC task is a long-standing problem and has\nattracted much attention from the community. The\nresearch emerges in recent years (Jia et al., 2013;\nXin et al., 2014; Yu and Li, 2014; Tseng et al.,\n2015; Fung et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019; Hong\net al., 2019), together with other topics, e.g., gram-\nmar error correction (GEC) (Rao et al., 2018; Ji\net al., 2017; Chollampatt et al., 2016; Ge et al.,\n2018). CSC focuses on detecting and correcting\ncharacter errors, while GEC also includes errors\nthat need deletion and insertion. Previous work\nhandles CSC using unsupervised language mod-\nels (Liu et al., 2013; Yu and Li, 2014). The errors\nare detected/corrected by evaluating the perplexity\nof sentences/phrases. However, these models were\nunable to condition the correction on the input sen-\ntence. To circumvent this problem, several discrim-\ninative sequence tagging methods were adopted for\nCSC (Wang et al., 2018). For more ﬂexibility and\nbetter performance, several sequence-to-sequence\nmodels were also employed (Wang et al., 2019;\nJi et al., 2017; Chollampatt et al., 2016; Ge et al.,\n2018), as well as BERT (Hong et al., 2019).\nRecent attention was paid to utilizing the exter-\nnal knowledge of character similarity. The simi-\nlarity knowledge can be gathered into a dictionary,\ni.e., confusion set, where similar pairs are stored.\nYu and Li (2014) ﬁrst used the dictionary to retrieve\nsimilar candidates for potential errors. Wang et al.\n(2019) incorporated a copy mechanism into a recur-\nrent neural model. When given similar characters\nas input, their model uses the copy mechanism to\ndirectly copy the character to the target sentence.\nIn a sense, these models face difﬁculty in model-\ning the relationship between similar characters as\nthe similarity information is solely used for candi-\ndate selection. To capture the pronunciation/shape\nsimilarity and explore the prior dependencies be-\ntween characters, we propose to use graph convo-\nlution network (GCN) (Kipf and Welling, 2017) to\nmodel character inter-dependence, which is com-\nbined with the pre-training of BERT (Devlin et al.,\n2019; Cheng et al., 2019) for the CSC task.\nGCN has been applied to model the relationship\non several tasks. Yan et al. (2019) equipped it into\nthe relation extraction task where relations con-\nstruct a hierarchical tree. Li et al. (2018); Cheng\net al. (2018) use it to model spatial-temporal to\npredict trafﬁc ﬂow. GCN was also used to model\nthe relationship between labels in a multi-label\ntask (Chen et al., 2019). In this paper, it is the\nﬁrst time that GCN is applied successfully into the\nCSC task. The relationship in CSC is much differ-\nent from those tasks where objects in the graph are\nsemantically related. By contrast, the similar char-\nacters are semantically distinct in CSC. Therefore,\nwe deeply investigate the effect of our SpellGCN\nand propose several essential techniques.\n3 Approach\nIn this section, we elaborate on our method for\nCSC. Firstly, the problem formulation is presented.\nThen, we introduce the motivations for SpellGCN,\nfollowed by its detailed description. At last, we\npresent its application in the CSC task.\n3.1 Problem Formulation\nThe Chinese Spelling Check task aims to detect\nand correct the errors in the Chinese language.\nWhen given a text sequence X = {x1,x2,...,x n}\nconsisting of n characters, the model takes X\nas input and output a target character sequence\nY = {y1,y2,...,y n}. We formulate the task as a\nconditional generation problem by modeling and\nmaximizing the conditional probability p(Y|X).\n3.2 Motivations\nThe framework of the proposed method is depicted\nin Figure 1. It consists of two components, i.e., a\ncharacter representation extractor and a SpellGCN.\nThe extractor derives a representation vector for\neach character. Above the extractor, SpellGCN is\nused to model the inter-dependence between char-\nacters. It outputs target vectors containing the in-\nformation of similar characters after interactions.\nAs illustrated in Table 1, a vanilla language\nmodel is able to provide feasible corrections in\nsemantic meaning but faces the difﬁculty in meet-\ning the pronunciation constraint. Although the cor-\nrection “月消费最” is semantically plausible, its\nphonics differs much from “ 换经费产” and “环\n境非常”. This indicates that the similarity infor-\nmation between characters is necessary so that the\nmodel can learn to generate related answers. Previ-\nous methods have taken the similarity into consid-\neration. However, they typically regarded similar\ncharacters as potential candidates, neglecting their\ninter-relationship in terms of pronunciation and\nshape. This work makes a preliminary attempt to\nhandle this issue, trying to fuse both the symbolic\nspace (phonological and visual similarity knowl-\nedge) and the semantic space (language semantic\nknowledge) into one model. To achieve this, we\nleverage the power of graph neural network (GNN)\nto infuse the similarity knowledge directly. The\nessential idea is to update the representations by ag-\ngregating the information between similar charac-\nters. Intuitively, a model is likely to have a sense of\nsimilar symbols when equipped with our method.\nAmong various GNN models, we use GCN in\nour implementation. Since there are up to 5K Chi-\nnese characters in the graph, the light-weight GCN\nis more suitable for our problem. The proposed\nSpellGCN is depicted as follows in detail.\n3.3 Structure of SpellGCN\nSpellGCN requires two similarity graphs Ap,As\nfor pronunciation and shape similarities corre-\nspondingly, which are derived from an open-\nsourced confusion set (Wu et al., 2013). For sim-\nplicity, the superscript will be omitted if unnec-\nessary and A denotes one of these two similarity\ngraphs. Each similarity graph is a binary adjacent\nmatrix of size RN×N , constructed from N charac-\nters in the confusion set. The edge Ai,j ∈{0,1}\nbetween i-th character and j-th character denotes\nwhether the (i,j) pair exists in the confusion set.\nThe goal of SpellGCN is to learn a map function\nto map the input node embedding Hl ∈RN×D\nof l-th layer (where D is the dimensionality of\ncharacter embedding) to a new representationHl+1\nvia convolutional operation deﬁned by A. This\nmap function has two main sub-components: a\ngraph convolution operation and an attentive graph\ncombination operation.\nGraph Convolution Operation The graph con-\nvolution operation is to absorb the information\nfrom neighboring characters in the graph. In\neach layer, the light-weight convolution layer in\nGCN (Kipf and Welling, 2017) is adopted:\nf(A,Hl) = ˆAHlWl\ng , (1)\nwhere Wl\ng ∈ RD×D is a trainable matrix and\nˆA ∈RN×N is the normalized version of the ad-\njacent matrix A. For the deﬁnition of ˆA, we di-\nrect you to the original paper (Kipf and Welling,\n2017). Note that we use the character embedding of\nBERT as the initial node features H0, and we omit\nthe non-linearity function after convolution. Since\nwe adopted BERT as our extractor, which has its\nown learned semantic space, we remove the activa-\ntion function from the equation to keep the derived\nrepresentation identical with original space, rather\nthan a completely different space. During our ex-\nperiments, using non-linearity activation such as\nReLU is ineffective, resulting in a performance\ndrop.\nAttentive Graph Combination Operation The\ngraph convolution operation handles the similarity\nof a single graph. To combine the pronunciation\nand shape similarity graphs, the attention mecha-\nnism (Bahdanau et al., 2015) is adopted. For each\ncharacter, we represent the combination operation\nSpellGCN\nBERT Extractor\n… \t\t\t𝐯𝒊$𝟐 \t\t\t𝐯𝒊$𝟏 …\t\t\t𝐯𝒊\t\t𝐯𝒊$𝟑\n… 到 逆 …竟遇\n𝐄: Word Embedding\n\t\nLayer-1\nLayer-2\nPronunciation SimilarityGraph ShapeSimilarity Graph\nAttentiveCombination\n… 境 金 井镜亰 静 寄 竟 …\n𝐖: Generated Classifier\n…\nLayer-3\n… 到 逆 …境遇\n… … …\n…\n寄井\n静 境\n金\n…\n… …\n竟\n… … …\n…\n景竞\n镜 境\n亰\n…\n… …\n竟\nDot Product\nOutoftheConfusionSet\nFigure 1: The framework of the proposed SpellGCN. Left: The characters in the input sentence are processed by\nthe extractor to obtain the semantic representation vectors.Right: The phonological or visual similarity knowledge\nof characters is learned by our SpellGCN. Two similarity graphs are used to model the pronunciation and shape\nsimilarities respectively, and they are combined via an attentive combination operation. Middle: The character\nembedding vectors derived from SpellGCN are used as the target character classiﬁers .\nas follows:\nCl\ni =\n∑\nk∈{s,p}\nαl\ni,kfk(Ak,Hl)i , (2)\nwhere Cl ∈RN×D and fk(Ak,Hl)i is the i-th\nrow of convolved representation of graph k, αi,k is\na scalar for i-th character denoting the weight of\ngraph k. The weight αi,k is computed by\nαi,k = exp(wafk(Ak,Hl)i/β)∑\nk′exp(wafk′(Ak′\n,Hl)i/β), (3)\nwhere wa ∈RD is a learnable vector shared across\nthe layers and β is a hyper-parameter which con-\ntrols the smoothness of attention weights. We\nfound βessential for the attention mechanism.\nAccumulated Output After graph convolution\nand attentive combination operations, we obtain a\nrepresentation Cl for l-th layer. To maintain the\noriginal semantic of the extractor, all outputs of\nprevious layers are accumulated as the output:\nHl+1 = Cl +\nl∑\ni=0\nHi . (4)\nIn this way, SpellGCN is able to focus on capturing\nthe knowledge of character similarity, leaving the\nresponsibility of semantic reasoning to the extrac-\ntor. Hopefully, each layer can learn to aggregate\nthe information for the speciﬁc hop. During the\nexperiments, the model failed when excluding H0.\n3.4 SpellGCN for Chinese Spelling Check\nHere, we introduce how to apply SpellGCN to the\nCSC task. Motivated by recent applications of\nGCN in relationship modeling (Chen et al., 2019;\nYan et al., 2019), we use the ﬁnal output of Spell-\nGCN to be classiﬁers of the target characters.\nSimilarity Graphs from Confusion Set The\nsimilarity graphs used in SpellGCN are constructed\nfrom the confusion set provided in (Wu et al.,\n2013). It is a pre-deﬁned set consisting of similar\ncharacters for most of (∼95%) the Chinese charac-\nters and these characters are categorized into ﬁve\ncategories, i.e., (1) similar shape, (2) same pro-\nnunciation and same tone, (3) same pronunciation\nand different tone, (4) similar pronunciation and\nsame tone, (5) similar pronunciation and different\ntone. Since the pronunciation similarity is more\nﬁne-grained compared with the shape similarity cat-\negory, we combine the pronunciation similarities\ninto one graph. Consequently, we construct two\ngraphs corresponding to pronunciation and shape\nsimilarities.\nCharacter Representation by Extractor The\nrepresentation of characters used for ﬁnal classi-\nﬁcation is given by an extractor. We can use any\nmodel that is able to output representation vectors\nV = {v1,v2,..., vn}(where vi ∈RD) for nchar-\nacters X = {x1,x2,...,x n}. In our experiment,\nwe adopt BERT as the backbone model. It takes X\nas input and uses the output of the last layer as V.\nWe conduct the experiment using the base version,\nwhich has 12 layers, 12 self-attention heads with a\nhidden size of 768 2.\n2This means D=768 in our experiment.\nSpellGCN as Character Classiﬁer When given\nthe representation vector vi of a character xi, the\nmodel needs to predict a target character through a\nfully-connected layer whose weight W ∈RM×D\nis conﬁgured by the output of SpellGCN (M is the\nsize of the extractor vocabulary):\np(ˆyi|X) =softmax(Wvi) . (5)\nConcretely, the output vectors of SpellGCN plays\nthe role of the classiﬁer in our task. We use the\noutput of the last layer of SpellGCN HL (where L\nis the number of layers) to classify the characters\nin the confusion set. And since the confusion set\nonly covers a subset of vocabulary, we use the\nword embedding of the extractor as the classiﬁer\nfor those excluded by the confusion set. In this way,\ndenoting ui ∈{1,...,N }is the index of confusion\nset for the i-th character in the extractor vocabulary,\nW is presented by:\nWi =\n{\nHL\nui , if i-th character ∈confusion set\nEi, otherwise ,\n(6)\nwhere E ∈RM×D is the embedding matrix of ex-\ntractor. In brief, we use the embedding from Spell-\nGCN if the character is in the confusion set. Other-\nwise, the embedding vectors are used as in BERT.\nInstead of modeling a large compact graph con-\ntaining all characters in the extractor vocabulary,\nwe chose this implementation for computational\nefﬁciency, since there are around 5K characters in\nthe confusion set and more than 20K characters in\nthe extractor vocabulary.\nOverall, the objective is to maximize the log\nlikelihood of target characters:\nL=\n∑\nX,Y\n∑\ni\nlog p(ˆyi = yi|X) . (7)\n3.5 Prediction Inference\nThe CSC task consists of two sub-tasks in evalua-\ntion, i.e., detection and correction. Some previous\nwork (Yu and Li, 2014; Liu et al., 2013) used two\nmodels for these sub-tasks separately. In this work,\nwe simply use the character with the highest proba-\nbility arg maxˆyi p(ˆyi|X) as the prediction for the\ncorrection task. And the detection is achieved by\nchecking whether the prediction matches the target\ncharacter yi.\n4 Experiments\nIn this section, we describe our experiment in de-\ntail. We ﬁrst present the training data and test data,\nTraining Data # Line Avg.

After that, the\nablation studies are made to analyze the effect of\nthe proposed components, followed by a case study.\nFinally, quantitative results are provided.\n4.1 Datasets\nTraining Data The training data is composed of\nthree training datasets (Wu et al., 2013; Yu et al.,\n2014; Tseng et al., 2015), which has 10K data\nsamples in total. Following (Wang et al., 2019),\nwe also include additional 271K samples as the\ntraining data, which are generated by an automatic\nmethod (Wang et al., 2018) 3.\nTest Data To evaluate the performance of the\nproposed method, we used three test datasets from\nthe SIGHAN 2013, SIGHAN 2014, SIGHAN 2015\nbenchmarks (Wu et al., 2013; Yu et al., 2014; Tseng\net al., 2015) as in (Wang et al., 2019).

We trained this model\nusing the same setting, i.e., the comparable\nmodel w/o SpellGCN.\nEvaluation Metrics The precision, recall and F1\nscores are reported as the evaluation metrics, which\nare commonly used in the CSC tasks. These met-\nrics are provided for the detection and correction\nsub-tasks. Besides the evaluation on the charac-\nter level, we also report the sentence-level metrics\non the detection and correction sub-tasks, which\nis more appealing for real-world applications. On\nthe sentence level, we consider a sentence to be\ncorrectly annotated only if all errors in the sentence\nare corrected as in (Hong et al., 2019) 5. On the\ncharacter level, we calculate the metrics using the\nevaluation script from (Wang et al., 2019) 6. We\nalso evaluated BERT and SpellGCN by the ofﬁcial\nevaluation metrics tools7, which gives False Posi-\ntive Rate (FTR), Accuracy and Precision/Recall/F1.\n4.2 Hyper-parameters\nOur code is based on the repository of BERT 8. We\nﬁne-tune the models using AdamW (Loshchilov\nand Hutter, 2018) optimizer for 6 epochs with a\nbatch size of 32 and a learning rate of 5e-5. The\nnumber of the layer in SpellGCN is 2, and the at-\ntentive combination operation with factor 3 is used.\nAll experiments were conducted for 4 runs and the\naveraged metric is reported. The code and trained\nmodels will be released publicly after review (cur-\nrently, the code is attached in the supplementary\nﬁles).\n5https://github.com/iqiyi/FASPell\n6https://github.com/wdimmy/Confusionset-guided-\nPointer-Networks-for-Chinese-Spelling-Check\n7http://nlp.ee.ncu.edu.tw/resource/csc.html\n8https://github.com/google-research/bert\nSIGHAN 2014FPR D-A C-A D-P D-R D-F C-P C-R C-F\nBERT 15.3 76.8 75.7 81.9 68.9 74.9 81.4 66.7 73.3\nSpellGCN 14.1 77.7 76.9 83.1 69.5 75.7 82.8 67.8 74.5\nSIGHAN 2015FPR D-A C-A D-P D-R D-F C-P C-R C-F\nBERT 13.6 83.0 81.5 85.9 78.9 82.3 85.5 75.8 80.5\nSpellGCN 13.2 83.7 82.2 85.9 80.6 83.1 85.4 77.6 81.3\nTable 4: The performance of BERT and SpellGCN evaluated by ofﬁcial tools on SIGHAN 2014 and SIGHAN\n2015.

When using SpellGCN,\nthe model achieves better results in all test sets\nagainst vanilla BERT, which veriﬁes its effective-\nness. The improvement is considerable with such a\nlarge amount of training data (cf. the comparison in\nFigure 2). This indicates the similarity knowledge\nis essential for CSC and it can hardly be learned\nby simply increasing the data amount. In terms of\nsentence-level F1score metric in the correction sub-\ntask, i.e., C-F score in the last column, the improve-\nments against previous best results (FASPell) are\n9.2%, 9.7% and 13.3% respectively. Nevertheless,\nit should be noted that FASpell was trained on dif-\nferent training data while this paper follows the set-\nting mentioned in the PN paper (Wang et al., 2019).\nIdeally, our method is compatible with FASpell\nand better results can be achieved when FASpell is\nemployed.\nFASpell used their own metrics, which are differ-\nent from the sentence-level false postive and false\nnegtivate counting strategy of the ofﬁcial evalua-\ntion toolkit. We used the scripts by PGNet and\nFASpell to compute their metrics for fair compari-\nson. We further add the ofﬁcial evaluation results\nof BERT and SpellGCN in Table 4. Actually, Spell-\nGCN consistently improves the performance when\nevaluated by the PGNet/FASpell scripts and the\nofﬁcial evaluation toolkit. We will add the FPR\nresults in our revision. The FPR scores are 14.1%\n(SpellGCN) v.s. 15.3% (BERT) on SIGHAN 14,\nand 13.2% (SpellGCN) v.s. 13.6% (BERT) on\nSIGHAN 15. FPR on SIGHAN 13 is statistically\nmeaningless since almost all the tested sentences\nhave the spelling errors.\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6\nepochs\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\nBERT F1score\nSpellGCN F1score\nBERT Precision\nSpellGCN Precision\nBERT Recall\nSpellGCN Recall\nFigure 2: The test curves for sentence-level correction\nmetrics with and without SpellGCN w.r.t. the number\nof training epochs on SIGHAN 2015.\n4.4 Ablation Studies\nIn this subsection, we analyze the effect of several\ncomponents, including the number of layers and\nthe attention mechanism. The ablation experiments\nwere performed using 10K training data.\nEffect of the Number of Layers Generally, the\nperformance of a GCN varies with the number of\nlayers. We investigate how the number of Spell-\nGCN layers inﬂuence the performance in CSC. In\nthis comparison, the number of layers changes from\n1 to 4, and the results are illustrated in Figure 3.\nFor clarity, we report the character-level C-F on\nthe three test datasets. The results indicate that\nSpellGCN is able to make use of multiple layers.\nWith multiple layers, SpellGCN can aggregate the\ninformation in more hops and therefore, achieve\nbetter performance. However, the F1score drops\nwhen the number of layers is larger than 3. This is\nreasonable due to the over-smooth problem noted\nin (Yan et al., 2019). When the number of GCN\nlayers increases, the representations of neighboring\ncharacters in the similarity graph will get more and\nmore similar since they all are calculated via those\nof their neighbors in the similarity graph.\nSIGHAN13 SIGHAN14 SIGHAN15\n60\n62\n64\n66\n68\n1 2 3 4\nFigure 3: The character-level C-F results (%) w.r.t. the\ndepth of SpellGCN.

The averaged character-level C-F scores\nof 4 runs on the SIGHAN 2013 are reported. The mod-\nels were trained with 10K training samples. Mean pool-\ning denotes that the output representation Cl of each\nlayer is the average of fk∈{P,S}(Ak,Hl), while sum\npooling summarizes fk∈{P,S}(Ak,Hl).\nEffect of Attention Mechanism We investigate\nhow to better combine the graphs in the SpellGCN\nlayer. Here, we compare the attention mechanism\nagainst sum-pooling and mean-pooling, with dif-\nferent hyper-parameter βmentioned in Section 3.3.\nThe experiments are conducted based on the 2-layer\nSpellGCN on SIGHAN 2013 test set. The results\npresented in Table 5 show that the sum pooling\nfails in the CSC task. We suggest that the sum\npooling is inconsistent with the normalization of\nGCN and fails to combine the information from\ndifferent channels (i.e., graphs). The mean pool-\ning is feasible but is surpassed by the attention\nmechanism. This indicates that the adaptive com-\nbination for each character node is beneﬁcial. We\nincorporate a hyper-parameter βinto the attention\noperation since the dot products may grow large in\nmagnitude, pushing the softmax function into re-\ngions where it has extremely small gradients. With\nthese results, we chose the attention mechanism\nwith a βof 3 in SpellGCN.\nPronunciation: f˘ang→f´an, w`ang→w`ang\n...走路真的麻坊，我也没有喝的东西，在家汪了...\n...走路真的麻木，我也没有喝的东西，在家呆了...\n...走路真的麻烦，我也没有喝的东西，在家忘了...\nPronunciation: y¯in→y˘ing\n...因为妈妈或爸爸在看录音机...帮小孩子解决问题...\n...因为妈妈或爸爸在看录音机...帮小孩子解决问题...\n...因为妈妈或爸爸在看录影机...帮小孩子解决问题...\nShape:向→尚\n...不过在许多传统文化的国家，女人向未得到平等...\n...不过在许多传统文化的国家，女人从未得到平等...\n...不过在许多传统文化的国家，女人尚未得到平等...\nTable 6: Several prediction results on the test set. The\nﬁrst line in the block is the input sentence. The second\nline is corrected by BERT without SpellGCN. And the\nlast line is the result from SpellGCN. We highlight the\nincorrect/correct characters by orange/blue color.\n4.5 Case Study\nWe show several correction results to demonstrate\nthe properties of SpellGCN. In addition to the sam-\nple illustrated in Table 1, several prediction results\nare given in Table 6. From these cases, we can\ntell that our SpellGCN is capable of revising the\nincorrect characters into correct ones with the pro-\nnunciation and shape constraint. For instance, in\nthe ﬁrst case, “ 麻坊(f˘ang)” is detected as errors\nand modiﬁed into “麻烦(f´an)”. Without pronuncia-\ntion similarity constraint, “麻木(m`u)” becomes the\nmost probable answer. And surprisingly, in the sec-\nond case, our SpellGCN successfully modiﬁes the\ncharacter reasonable in the context. The meaning\nof input sentence “看录音机” is “watch the audio\nrecorder”, and our method corrects it into “看录影\n机” which means “watch the video recorder”. We\nsuggest that SpellGCN injects a prior similarity be-\ntween “音” and “影” in the representation space so\nthat the model derives a higher posterior probabil-\nity of “影”. In the last case, we show a correction\nresult under the shape constraint. In the confusion\nset, “向” is similar to “ 尚” and therefore, using\nSpellGCN is able to retrieve the correct result.\n4.6 Character Embedding Visualization\nPrevious experiments have explored the perfor-\nmance of SpellGCN quantitatively in detail. To\nqualitatively study whether SpellGCN learns mean-\ningful representations, we dive into the target em-\nbedding space W derived from SpellGCN.\nIn Figure 4, the embedding of characters with\nphonics “ch ´ang” and “s `ı” is presented using t-\nSNE (Maaten and Hinton, 2008).

This is reasonable as\nthis similarity knowledge is absent in the model-\ning. In contrast, our SpellGCN successfully infuses\nthis prior knowledge into the embedding and the\nresulting embedding exhibits cluster patterns. The\nembedding of characters with these two different\npronunciations forms two clusters, corresponding\nto “ch´ang” and “s`ı” respectively. Due to this prop-\nerty, the model tends to recognize similar charac-\nters and hence is able to retrieve the answers under\npronunciation constraint. Figure 5 shows the same\nsituation for the shape similarity, where two sets of\ncharacters with the shape similar to “长” and “祀”\nare scattered. This veriﬁes the ability of SpellGCN\nin modeling shape similarity.\n5 Conclusions\nWe proposed SpellGCN for CSC to incorporate\nboth phonological and visual similarities into lan-\nguage models. The empirical comparison and the\nresults of analytical experiments verify its effective-\nness. Beyond CSC, SpellGCN can be generalized\nto other situations where speciﬁc prior knowledge\nis available, and to other languages by leveraging\nspeciﬁc similarity graphs analogously. Our method\ncan also be adapted to grammar error correction,\nwhich needs insertion and deletion, by utilizing\nmore ﬂexible extractors such as Levenshtein Trans-\nformer (Gu et al., 2019). We leave this direction to\nfuture work.\nReferences\nDzmitry Bahdanau, Kyunghyun Cho, and Yoshua Ben-\ngio. 2015. Neural machine translation by jointly\nlearning to align and translate.
