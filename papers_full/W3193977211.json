These\nscenarios can be considered as the temporal equivalent of\nspatial multi-layered media [39] with the difference that in\nthe former case time-varying media with stepped permit-\ntivity proﬁles are implemented for the whole spatially un-\nbounded medium where the wave travels. Within this\nframework, by translating to the temporal case the well-\nknown quarter-wave impedance-matching scheme in mi-\ncrowave engineering [40], the idea of antireﬂection tempo-\nral coatings [41] was also put forward in order to attain\nreﬂectionless frequency conversion and to achieve imped-\nance matching in spatiotemporal scenarios. More recently,\nthis idea was further expanded to more general temporal\nmultisteps in order to attain higher-order transfer functions\n[42], and several design examples inspired by spatial-\nmultilayer counterparts were discussed. However, the sys-\ntematic synthesis of the desired transfer function remains an\nopen problem.\nHere, we exploit the space-time duality that exists\nbetween spatial and temporal boundaries to introduce a\nrigorous and systematic framework for the synthesis of\ntemporal media having temporal multistep permittivity\nfunctions. First, we prove analytically that, under carefully\nengineered conditions, there exists a remarkably simple,\nand yet nonintuitive, mathematical relationship that con-\nnects the reflectivity of a temporal multistep and the\ninsertion loss of a conventional spatial multilayer. This\nresult bears important practical implications since it en-\nables the direct exploitation of the vast arsenal of synthesis\napproaches that have been developed in microwave engi-\nneering for the design of spatial quarter-wave multilayered\nimpedance transformers [40]. As a proof of concept, here\nwe show that the general synthesis approach developed by\nRiblet in the 1950s [43] for the spatial case can be seam-\nlessly applied to the synthesis of broadband temporal\nimpedance-matching transformers. As it will be shown, for\na temporal boundary between lossless dielectrics, this\napproach allows the synthesis of arbitrary, real-valued\npolynomial transfer functions by resorting to temporal\nsections featuring real-valued positive refractive indices.\nAccordingly, the rest of the manuscript is structured as\nfollows. In Section 2, we outline the problem formulation,\nhighlight the formal analogies between the responses of\nspatial and temporal multisteps, and illustrate the syn-\nthesis approach. In Section 3, we demonstrate some\nrepresentative syntheses featuring maximally ﬂat (bino-\nmial) and equi-ripple (Chebyshev) responses. Moreover,\nwe validate the approach by comparison with full-wave\nnumerical simulations in the presence of narrowband and\nbroadband input signals, and for unbounded and bounded\nregions. Finally, in Section 4, we provide some brief con-\nclusions and discuss possible perspectives. Some ancillary\ndetails on the analytical and computational aspects are\nprovided in Section 5. Our results, which include the tem-\nporal quarter-wave design [41] as a special case, provide\nnew insights and deeper understanding of the role and\npossible applications of temporal boundaries by exploiting\nthe space-time duality in the study of wave propagation in\ntemporal metamaterials and pave the way to novel exciting\ndevelopments in this emergingﬁeld.\n2 Analytical formulation and\nresults\n2.1 Spatial multilayered impedance\ntransformers\nReferring to Figure 1(A) for schematic illustration, we start\nconsidering a simple conﬁguration of a spatial impedance\ntransformer, featuring a multilayered structure made ofM\ndielectric layers (with refractive indexnm and thicknessdm,\nm = 1, …, M) stacked along thex-direction and sandwiched\nbetween semi-inﬁnite regions with refractive index ni\n(input, x < 0) andne (exterior, x > xM = d1 + d2 + ⋯ + dM).\nThroughout this study, we assume a time-harmonic\nexp (−iωt) time-dependence, and nonmagnetic, lossless\nmedia (i.e., real-valued refractive indices). Moreover, we\nassume that the operating frequencies are much smaller\nthan any material resonance frequencies. In so doing, the\nmaterials can approximately be considered as being\nnondispersive [1, 29, 41, 42, 44]. As detailed in the Methods\nSection 5.1, for normally incident plane-wave illumination,\nthe ﬁeld propagation inside the multilayer can be rigor-\nously described via the transfer-matrix formalism [39], with\nthe (dimensionless, unimodular) matrix\nSm(θ) =\n⎡\n⎢⎢⎣\ncos θ i\nνm\n sin θ\niνm sin θ cos θ\n⎤\n⎥⎥⎦ (1)\nrelating the transverse electric and magnetic field compo-\nnents (suitably normalized) at the two interfaces of the\ngeneric mth layer. In Equation (1),νm = nm/ni indicates the\nnormalized refractive index (with respect to that of the\ninput section), and θ = knmdm the electrical thickness,\nwhich we assume is identical for all layers; here,k = ω/c =\n2π/λ denotes the wavenumber in a vacuum, andc and λ the\n3688 G. Castaldi et al.: Exploiting space-time duality in impedance synthesis\ncorresponding speed of light and wavelength, respectively.\nBy chain multiplication, we can straightforwardly relate\nthe transverseﬁelds at the input (x = 0) and output (x = xM)\ninterfaces via the total transfer matrix [39]\nS = ∏\n1\nm=M\nSm = [ s11 is12\nis21 s22\n] , (2)\nwhere s11, s12, s21, and s22 are real-valued and satisfy the\n(unimodular) condition s11s22 + s12s21 = 1. From there, the\nreﬂection coefﬁcient can be obtained as (see the Methods\nSection 5.1 for further details)\nρ = s22 + is21 − νe(s11 + is12)\ns22 − is21 + νe(s11 − is12)  , (3)\nwith νe = ne/ni. In a typical impedance-matching scenario,\nfor a given index mismatch between the input and exterior\nregions, the general problem entails synthesizing the\nmultilayer in such a way that reﬂections are minimized over\na broad frequency range [40]. Within this framework, for\nmoderately small index mismatches, the small-reﬂection\napproximation (which essentially neglects multiple re-\nﬂections inside the multilayer) provides a very simple and\neffective parameterization that enables systematic Fourier-\nbased synthesis strategies [40]. However, such approxima-\ntion does not provide any major advantage when applied to\nthe temporal counterpart of interest in this study and\ntherefore is not pursued here.\nFigure 1: Problem schematic.\n(A) Spatial multilayer (with refractive indicesnm and thicknessesdm, n = 1, …, M) sandwiched between two semi-inﬁnite regions with\nrefractive indicesni (input) andne (exterior), under normally incident, plane-wave illumination. (B) Temporal transition (in a spatially\nunbounded medium) of the refractive index between the valuesni (initial) andne (end) via a multistep proﬁle (temporal multistep, with\nrefractive indicesnm and durationsδm, n = 1, …, M).\nG. Castaldi et al.: Exploiting space-time duality in impedance synthesis 3689\n2.2 Temporal multistep impedance\ntransformers\nLet us now consider the temporal counterpart schemati-\ncally illustrated in Figure 1(B). As in Section 2.1, here we\nagain start considering a monochromatic electromagnetic\nwave as the incident signal. In the temporal case, however,\nthis wave travels within a homogeneous and spatially\nunbounded medium having an initial refractive indexn\ni for\ntimes t < t0. Starting at a time instantt = t0, we assume a\ntemporal modulation of the refractive index characterized\nby M intervals (each of durationδ\nm, featuring an ideal step\ntransition to a refractive indexnm), reaching an end value\nne at time tM = δ1 + δ2 + ⋯ + δM. Speciﬁcally, we only\nconsider changes of the refractive index produced by\nnonmagnetic media with time-varying permittivity.\nClearly, the assumption of step temporal transitions is\nhighly idealized, as it implies that the medium response to\nmodulation is inﬁnitely fast. In reality, a rise/fall time\nshould be considered when changing the permittivity of\nthe medium. In this context, as long as such fall/rise time is\nmuch smaller than the period of the incident wave, our\napproach will continue to be valid. Indeed, in our numer-\nical simulations (see the Methods Section 5.3) we do as-\nsume fast but still smooth transitions with short rise/fall\ntimes, in order to obtain accurate results and for the\nsimulator to converge.\nNote that, in order to better highlight the formal analo-\ng i e sw i t ht h es p a t i a ls c e n a r i o ,w eh a v eu t i l i z e dt h es a m e\nsymbolsM, n\ni, ne,a n dnm, although their physical meaning is\nnow evidently different. As detailed in the Methods Section\n5.1, also for this temporal multistep, it is possible to study the\nwave propagation via a rigorous transfer-matrix approach.\nSpeciﬁcally, by suitably normalizing the relevant electric and\nmagnetic inductionﬁelds, we can obtain a transfer matrix\nformally analogous to that in Equation (1), viz. [37],\nSm(φ) =\n⎡\n⎢⎢⎣\ncos φ i\nνm\n sin φ\niνm sin φ cos φ\n⎤\n⎥⎥⎦ , (4)\nwith φ = ωδm/νm now denoting the normalized travel time,\nonce again assumed identical for all intervals. Accord-\ningly, by chain multiplication, we can obtain the transfer\nmatrix connecting the (normalized) electric and magnetic\ninduction ﬁelds at the initial (t = t0) and ﬁnal (t = tM)\ntemporal boundaries, which is formally identical to the\nexpression in Equation (2) (but with argumentφ instead of\nθ). From there, the backward (BW) wave coefﬁcient, which\nis the temporal analog of the reﬂection coefﬁcient, can be\nderived as (see the Methods Section 5.1 for more details)\nR = s22 + is21\n2ν2\ne\n− s11 + is12\n2νe\n . (5)\nWe highlight that, in spite of the aforementioned\nformal analogies, the above expression differs from that in\nEquation (3) since, in view of causality, the reﬂection co-\nefﬁcient assumes different meanings in the spatial and\ntemporal cases. Nevertheless, as discussed hereafter, the\nspace-time duality can be directly exploited by resorting to\ndifferent observables.\n2.3 Formal analogies\nIn microwave engineering, rigorous approaches to the\nsynthesis of spatial multilayered impedance transformers\ntypically consider as a meaningful parameter theinsertion\nloss (or power loss ratio) [40]\nPL = 1\n1 − |ρ|2 = 1\n2 + νe(s2\n11 + s2\n12)\n4 + s2\n22 + s2\n21\n4νe\n , (6)\nwhere the second equality follows from Equation (3) taking\ninto account the unimodular condition. On the other hand,\nfrom Equation (5) and similar arguments, we obtain for the\ntemporal case\n|R|2 = ν−3\ne [ − 1\n2 + νe(s2\n11 + s2\n12)\n4 + s2\n22 + s2\n21\n4νe\n] , (7)\nfrom which the formal analogy with the insertion loss in\nEquation (6) becomes apparent. Speciﬁcally, by suitably\nmapping the arguments (θ ↔φ, i.e.,knmdm ↔ωδm/νm), we\nobtain\nPL − 1 = ν3\ne|R|2 , (8)\nwhich represents the key result in our study, and the\ncornerstone of our proposed synthesis approach. We stress\nthat, in spite of its remarkably simple form, this result is\nneither trivial nor intuitive, as it connects two different\nobservables (spatial insertion loss and temporal reflectiv-\nity). By recalling the well-known expressions for the spatial\nreflection coefficient [39] and temporal BW coefﬁcient [34]\nin the absence of the multilayer and multistep, respectively\n(i.e., θ = φ = 0, corresponding to a single spatial/temporal\nboundary between media with refractive indicesn\ni and ne),\nρ(0) = ni − ne\nni + ne\n= 1 − νe\n1 + νe\n, (9)\nR(0) = ni(ni − ne)\n2n2\ne\n= 1 − νe\n2ν2\ne\n, (10)\nit can be readily verified that Equation (8) consistently\nholds in this especially simple case. However, our theory\n3690 G. Castaldi et al.: Exploiting space-time duality in impedance synthesis\nensures that this result also holds in the presence ofgeneric\nspatial and temporal multisteps, under the argument\nmapping θ ↔φ.\nIn what follows, we show how this formal analogy can\nbe leveraged to exploit the wealth of synthesis tools and\napproaches developed in microwave engineering for\nimpedance transformers using time-varying media.\n2.4 Synthesis strategy\nAs described in the introduction, a well-known synthesis\napproach for broadband spatial quarter-wave multilayered\nimpedance transformers is based on a theory put forward\nby Riblet in the 1950s [43], which systematizes and gener-\nalizes some previous results by Collin [45]. This approach\nallows the physically feasible synthesis of insertion-loss\nfunctions belonging to the general family\nP\nL(θ) = 1 + Q2\nM (cos θ) , (11)\nwhere QM is a real-valued,Mth degree polynomial. When\nparticularized to our spatial multilayered scenario in\nFigure 1(A), the above theory prescribes spatial quarter-\nwave thickness for the layers\nnmdm = λ0\n4 ,  m = 1, …, M , (12)\nwith λ0 = 2πc/ω0 denoting the vacuum wavelength at the\ndesired center angular frequencyω0. Moreover, forni and\nne real and positive, it guarantees that the resulting\nrefractive indicesnm of theM layers are likewise real and\npositive, and provides a constructive procedure for their\ncalculation; for the sake of completeness, the salient steps\nof the approach are summarized in the Methods Section 5.2.\nIn view of the formal analogy in Equation (8), the same\napproach enables the rigorous, systematic synthesis of\ntemporal multisteps (as in Figure 1(B)) with rather general\nreﬂectivity functions of polynomial type,\n|R(φ)|\n2 = ν−3\ne Q2\nM (cosφ) , (13)\nby exploitingthe same(real, positive) refractive indices as\nfor the spatial case above. In this case, the travel times of\nthe steps are chosen as\nδm\nνm\n= T0\n4 ,  m = 1, …, M , (14)\nwith T0 = 2π/ω0 denoting the period (in vacuum) at the\ndesired center frequency. We note that, in both spatial and\ntemporal cases, the polynomial functionQM must satisfy\nthe self-consistency relationship (in the limitθ, φ →0, i.e.,\nin the absence of the multilayer/multistep)\nQ2\nM (1) = PL(0) − 1 = ν3\ne|R(0)|2 = (1 − νe)2\n4νe\n . (15)\nIn what follows, we focus on two traditional designs\nknown for broadband spatial antireflection coatings,\nnamely, the maximally ﬂat and equi-ripple responses,\nwhich we then implement with temporal metamaterials to\nachieve their temporal analog. Interestingly, for these de-\nsigns, it can be shown [43] that the (normalized) refractive\nindices also satisfy the symmetry conditions\nν\nmνM+1−m = νe,  m = 1, …, M . (16)\nWe note that, for the special caseM = 1, the result in\nEquation (16) consistently reproduces the quarter-wave\ndesign n1 = ̅̅̅̅nine\n√ that was previously extended to the\ntemporal case [41].\n3 Broadband temporal impedance\ntransformers\n3.1 Spatially unbounded medium\nWe start considering the spatially unbounded-medium\nscenario in Figure 1(B), assuming as initial and end values\nfor the refractive indicesni = 1 andne = 2, respectively, and\nM = 4 intervals.\nAs a first synthesis example, we consider the so-called\nbinomial design [40],\n|R(φ)| = |1 − νe|\n2ν2\ne\n |cosφ|M  , (17)\nwhich ensures a maximally flat frequency response. Note\nthat the multiplicative constant in Equation (17) is\nselected so as to fulﬁll the self-consistency condition in\nEquation (10).\nBy applying the previously described synthesis strategy,\nwe obtain for the four temporal intervals: n1 = 1.044,\nn2 = 1.242, n3 = 1.610, and n4 = 1.915 [which satisfy the\nsymmetry conditions in Equation (16)], with the correspond-\ning durations obtained via Equation (14): δ1 = 0.261T0,\nδ2 = 0.311T0, δ3 = 0.403T0,a n dδ4 = 0.479T0.\nFigure 2 shows some representative results for this\ndesign. Speciﬁcally, Figure 2(A) shows a ﬁnite-element\ncomputed (see Section 5.3 for details) space-timeﬁeld map\npertaining to a narrowband modulated ( ∼12 cycle)\nGaussian pulse with center angular frequency chosen as\nthe design valueω0, from which we observe the expected\nfrequency conversion [1, 3] in the forward (FW) propa-\ngating waves at the temporal boundaries, but without\nvisible BW re ﬂected components, as an effect of the\nG. Castaldi et al.: Exploiting space-time duality in impedance synthesis 3691\nimpedance matching. As shown in Figure 2(B), these BW\nwaves become clearly visible if the center angular fre-\nquency of the pulse differ substantially (0.2ω0) from the\ndesign value, thereby indicating that the impedance\nmatching is less effective. For a more quantitative assess-\nment, we carry out multiple numerical simulations by\nvarying the center frequency of the narrowband pulse, so\nas to cover the spectral range of interest, and estimate the\nBW wave coef ﬁcient from the amplitude of the BW\ncomponent (normalized by the incident one). As shown in\nFigure 2(C), these results are in excellent agreement with\nthe theoretical design in Equation (17), yielding the desired\nmaximally ﬂat behavior; note that the response is centered\nat ω\n0/2 in view of the frequency conversion (ωe = niωi/ne)\nimparted by theﬁnal temporal boundary (withne = 2). We\nalso observe the expected broader bandwidth by compar-\nison with the reference quarter-wave design (i.e.,M = 1)\nthat was previously studied [41]. Within this framework,\nparalleling the spatial case [40], it is rather straightforward\nto estimate analytically the bilateral fractional bandwidth\nfor a given maximum tolerable BW wave coef ﬁcient\nR\nmax = |R(φmax)|, viz.,\nΔω\nω0\n= 2 − 4φmax\nπ  , (18)\nwhere φmax follows by inverting Equation (17) as\nφmax = arc cos [(2ν2\neRmax\n|1 − νe| )\n1\nM\n] . (19)\nNext, for the same design, we considerbroadband-\nmodulated (∼1 cycle) Gaussian pulsed excitation. Figure\n3(A) and (B) show two numerically computed instanta-\nneous ﬁeld maps at time instants before the initial temporal\nboundary (t < t0) and after theﬁnal onet > tM, respectively.\nThe BW wave is hardly visible on the scale of the plots and\nis better visualized in the saturated scale of Figure 3(C).\nFigure 3(D) shows instead a space-timeﬁeld map, which\nbetter illustrates the evolution of the FW and BW\nwavefronts.\nFrom a quantitative viewpoint, Figure 4(A) shows the\n(normalized) incident, FW, and BW waveforms atﬁxed\npositions, with the hardly visible BW component magniﬁed\nin Figure 4(B). The corresponding (normalized) spectra are\ndisplayed in Figure 4(C), once again with the BW compo-\nnent magniﬁed in Figure 4(D). As could be expected, with\nthe exception of the edges of the Gaussian spectrum, the\nBW spectrum is in very good agreement with the theoretical\ndesign in Equation (17). To sum up, our proposed design\nenables a nearly reﬂectionless frequency conversion of a\nbroadband pulse. It is also worth highlighting that,\nalthough the reﬂections are negligible, the FW transmitted\nﬁeld exhibits reduced amplitude; this is fully consistent\nwith the general theory of transmission of electromagnetic\nwaves at temporal boundaries [34].\nAs a second representative example, we consider the\nwell-known Chebyshev-type design,\n|R(φ)| =\n|1 − νe|\n2ν2\ne\n⃒⃒⃒⃒\n⃒⃒⃒⃒\nTM (sec φmaxcos φ)\nTM (sec φmax)\n⃒⃒⃒⃒\n⃒⃒⃒⃒ , (20)\nwith T\nM denoting anMth degree Chebyshev polynomial [46],\nwhich yields an equi-ripple response that maximizes the\ntradeoff between bandwidth and maximum reﬂection [40].\nAlso, in this case, the multiplicative constant is chosen so as\nto satisfy the self-consistency condition in Equation (10),\nwhereas the band-edge φmax is related to the maximum\nt o l e r a b l eB Ww a v ec o e fﬁcient (magnitude)Rmax via\nFigure 2: Binomial design:ni = 1, ne = 2, M = 4, n1 = 1.044, n2 = 1.242, n3 = 1.610, n4 = 1.915, δ1 = 0.261T0, δ2 = 0.311T 0, δ3 = 0.403T0, and\nδ4 = 0.479T 0.\n(A), (B) Numerically computed space-time maps (normalized electric field) for narrowband modulated Gaussian pulses with center angular\nfrequency ω0 and 0.2ω0, respectively.

Once φmax is known, the fractional\nbandwidth follows immediately from Equation (18).\nFor the Chebyshev design above, Figures 5–7 mirror the\nresults shown in Figures 2–4, respectively, following the\nsame layout and organization. The synthesized refractive\nindices and interval durations are given in the caption of\nFigure 5.\nT h es a m eq u a l i t a t i v eo b s e r vations as for the binomial\ndesign essentially hold in this case too, with the obvious\ndifferences in the spectral BW response (see Figures 5(C) and\n7(D)). Also, in this case, the agreement between numerical\nsimulations and theoretical design is very good. We also\nobserve that, although for different temporal multisteps the\nFW responses may differ even in the presence of very small\nreﬂections, in our example here the FW response is hardly\ndistinguishable from the one in Figure 4 (binomial design).\n3.2 Spatial discontinuity: toward\nbroadband spatiotemporal impedance\nmatching and frequency conversion\nAs a final example, we apply the temporal-impedance-\ntransformer concept to a scenario featuring a spatial\ndiscontinuity between two stationary media. In this case,\nsimilar to what was proposed in Ref. [41] for the spatio-\ntemporal quarter-wave antire ﬂection temporal coating\ncase, we introduce an intermediate spatial region where we\napply the temporal modulation. More speci ﬁcally, we\nassume an input region x < −2.5λ0 with (stationary)\nrefractive indexni, an exterior regionx > λ0 with (station-\nary) refractive indexne, and a central region−2.5λ0 < x <\n2.5λ0 where we apply the temporal modulation according\nto the previously considered binomial and Chebyshev de-\nsigns. The size of the central region as well as the initial\n(t0 = 15T0) and ﬁnal (tM = 16.453T0 for the binomial, and\ntM = 16.436T0 for the Chebyshev case) temporal bound-\naries is chosen so as the temporal modulation is active\nwhile the incident pulse is propagating through this region.\nFor the same parameters and designs as in the previous\nexamples (given in the captions of Figures 2 and 5) and\nbroadband (∼1 cycle) pulsed excitation, Figure 8 shows the\nnumerically computed results in this scenario. Speciﬁcally,\nFigure 8(A)–(C) show two representative instantaneous\nﬁeld maps and the space-timeﬁeld map pertaining to the\nbinomial design, whereas Figure 8(D)–(F) show the corre-\nsponding results for the Chebyshev design. In both cases,\nwe observe very weak BW (reﬂected) waves, which in-\ndicates that the temporal-impedance-transformer concept\ncan be applied to spatial discontinuities as well via\nspatiotemporal modulations of the refractive index.\nAs a reference, Figure 8(G)–(I) show the results for the\ncase of asingle-step modulation, where the refractive index\nin the central region is changed abruptly fromni to ne at\nt = t0 and then maintained constant. In this case, both\nspatial and temporal reﬂections are noticeably visible.\n4 Conclusions\nV i as p a c e - t i m ed u a l i t y ,w eh a v er i g o r o u s l ye s t a b l i s h e da\nformal analogy between the reflectivity of a temporal\nmultistep and the insertion loss of a conventional spatial\nFigure 5: Chebyshev design:ni = 1, ne = 2, M = 4, n1 = 1.120, n2 = 1.298, n3 = 1.541, n4 = 1.786. δ1 = 0.280T0, δ2 = 0.324T0, δ3 = 0.385T0,\nand δ4 = 0.446T0.\n(A), (B) Numerically computed space-time maps (normalized electric field) for narrowband modulated Gaussian pulses with center angular\nfrequency ω\n0 and 0.2ω0, respectively.

Castaldi et al.: Exploiting space-time duality in impedance synthesis\n5 Methods\n5.1 Analytical modeling\nFor the spatial multilayers in Section 2.1 (see Figure 1(A)), our transfer-\nmatrix formalism relies on effective voltages and currents related to\nthe electric and magnetic (transverse)ﬁeld components\nV ↔Ey,  I ↔ η\nni\nHz  , (22)\nwith η = ̅̅̅̅ ̅μ0/ϵ0\n√ denoting the vacuum intrinsic impedance. Accord-\ningly, the transfer matrix in Equation (1) relates the input and output\nvalues of these quantities for a generic layer, viz.,\n[ V\nm\nIm\n] = Sm ⋅ [ Vm−1\nIm−1\n],  m = 1, …, M . (23)\nAssuming a unit-amplitude incident electric field, the total\nelectric and magnetic fields outside the multilayer can be written as\nEy(x, t) = exp (−iωt){ exp (iknix) + ρexp (−iknix),  x <0 ,\nτexp [ikne(x − xM )],      x > xM  , (24)\nHz (x, t) = exp (−iωt)\n⎧⎪⎪\n⎪\n⎨\n⎪⎪\n⎪\n⎩\nni\nη [exp (iknix) − ρexp (−iknix)],  x <0 ,\nneτ\nη exp [ikne(x − xM )],        x > xM  ,\n(25)\nwith ρ and τ denoting the conventional reﬂection and transmission\ncoefﬁcients, respectively. From Equations (24) and (25), we can\nstraightforwardly obtain the effective voltage and current at the input\ninterface (x = 0) asV0 = 1 + ρ,  I0 = 1 − ρ, and at the output interface\n(x = xM )a sVM = τ,  IM = νeτ, which are connected by multilayer the\ntransfer matrix in Equation (2),\n[ VM\nIM\n] = [ s11 is12\nis21 s22\n] ⋅ [ V0\nI0\n]. (26)\nBy solving the above linear system with respect toρ and τ,w e\nobtain the expression in Equation (3) and\nτ = 2\ns22 − is21 + νe(s11 − is12) . (27)\nFor the temporal multisteps in Section 2.2 (see Figure 1(B)), our\ntransfer-matrix model relies instead on effective voltages and currents\nthat are related to the (normalized) magnetic and electric induction,\nrespectively,\nV ↔\ncBz\nni\n,  I ↔− Dy\nn2\ni ϵ0\n , (28)\nwhere\nBz = μ0Hz ,  Dy = ϵ0n2Ey. (29)\nWe highlight that the specific expressions and normalizations in\nEquation (28) are instrumental to obtain the transfer matrix in Equa-\ntion (4), which is formally analogous to that for the spatial case in\nEquation (1); this is crucial to reveal the space-time duality. Once\nagain, assuming a unit-amplitude electricﬁeld, the total electric and\nmagnetic ﬁelds before theﬁrst temporal boundary and after theﬁnal\none can be written as\nE\ny(x, t) =\nexp(iknix)\n⎧⎪⎪⎨\n⎪⎪\n⎩\nexp [ − iω(t − t\n0)],                t < t0,\nTexp [ − iω\nνe\n(t − tM )] + Rexp [iω\nνe\n(t − tM )],  t > tM  ,\n(30)\nHz (x, t)=\nexp(iknix)\n⎧⎪⎪⎪\n⎪\n⎨\n⎪⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎩\nni\nη exp [−iω(t−t0)],               t<t0,\nne\nη {Texp [−iω\nνe\n(t−tM )]−Rexp [iω\nνe\n(t−tM )]}, t>tM  ,\n(31)\nwith R and T denoting the BW and FW wave coefﬁcients, respec-\ntively [34]. By comparison with the spatial case in Equations (24)\nand (25), we note the conservation of the wavenumber (instead of\nfrequency), and the different role played by the reﬂection coefﬁ-\ncient, which does not appear before theﬁrst temporal boundary in\nview of causality. By proceeding as in the spatial case, we can write\nthe effective voltage and current at the initial temporal boundary\n(t = t\n0)a s V0 = 1,  I0 =− 1, and those at the ﬁnal one (t = tM )a s\nVM = νe(T − R), IM =− ν2\ne(T + R), and we can solve the resulting\nlinear system, analogous to that in Equation (26), in terms ofR and\nT. This yields the expression in Equation (5) and\nT = s22 + is21\n2ν2\ne\n+ s11 + is12\n2νe\n. (32)\n5.2 Riblet-type synthesis\nFor completeness, we summarize the salient steps of the synthesis\nprocedure, referring the reader to Ref. [43] for its theoretical founda-\ntions and more details. In essence, starting from the insertion-loss\nfunction in Equation (11), thecomplex-valued reﬂection coefﬁcient is\nreconstructed as\nρ(θ) =\nαQM (cos θ)\ncosM  θ + cosM−2 θ + ⋯ + isin θ(cosM−1 θ + cosM−3 + ⋯)  , (33)\nwhere the multiplicative constantα must be chosen so as to satisfy the\nself-consistency relationship in Equation (9), and the denominator has\nbeen constructed by retaining only the poles in the upper half of the\ncomplex ω-plane [i.e., Im(ω) ≥ 0], so as to ensure unconditional\nstability.\nFrom Equation (33), the normalized impedance at the input\ninterface x = 0 can be derived as\nZ0 = V0\nI0\n= 1 + ρ(θ)\n1 − ρ(θ) . (34)\nThen, recalling the transport formula of the normalized imped-\nance through a layer,\nZm = Vm\nIm\n=\ncos θZm−1 + isin θ\nνm\ncos θ + iνmsin θZm−1\n , (35)\nit is possible to iteratively solve for the unknown normalized refractive\nindices νm, m = 1, ..., M. Speciﬁcally, starting from the ﬁrst layer\n(m = 1), we obtain\nG.

Speciﬁcally, we utilize the time-domain solver, and consider a\ntwo-dimensional computational domain truncated by top and bottom\nperfectly electric conducting walls and left and right scattering\nboundary conditions to excite the incident ﬁeld and prevent re-\nﬂections, respectively. The computational domain is discretized via a\ntriangular mesh with size ranging from 10\n−4λ0 to 0.15λ0.\nFor the narrowband excitation in Figures 2 and 5, a number of\nseparate simulations are carried out, with Gaussian pulses featuring\ndifferent modulation frequencies (ωmod ranging from 0.2ω0 to ω0) and\nstandard deviations 2Tmod = 4π/ωmod; these pulses include approxi-\nmately 12 cycles.\nFor the broadband excitation in Figures 3, 4, 6–8 we consider\ninstead a modulated Gaussian pulse withωmod = ω0 and standard\ndeviation 0.3Tmod = 0.6π/ω0, which includes approximately one cy-\ncle. The spectra in Figures 4(C) and 7(C) are obtained via fast Fourier\ntransform of the corresponding waveforms, implemented via thefft\nroutine available in Matlab® [52].\nThe abrupt refractive index changes are implemented via rect-\nangular analytical functions with smooth transitions. The duration of\nthe transitions is much smaller than the modulation period\n(∼0.01T\nmod) in order to induce the temporal boundary, and two\ncontinuous derivatives are applied to the smooth transitions to ensure\nthe convergence of the simulations.\nAuthor contributions: All the authors have accepted\nresponsibility for the entire content of this submitted\nmanuscript and approved submission.\nResearch funding: G.C. and V.G. acknowledge partial\nsupport from the University of Sannio via the FRA 2019\nProgram.
