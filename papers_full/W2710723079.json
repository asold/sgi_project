  "abstract": "Passive components are indispensable in the design and development of microchips for high-frequency applications. Inductors in particular are used frequently in radio frequency (RF) IC's such as low-noise amplifiers and oscillators. High performance inductor has become one of the critical components for voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) design, for its quality factor (Q) value directly affects the VCO phase noise. The optimization of inductor layout can improve its performance, but the improvement is limited by selected technology. Inductor performance is bounded by the thin routing metal and small distance from lossy substrate. On the other hand, the in-accurate inductor modeling further limits the optimization process. The on-chip inductor has been an important research topic since it was first proposed in early 1990's. Significant amount of study has been accomplished and reported in literature; whereas some methods have been used in industry, but not released to public. It is of no doubt that a comprehensive solution is not exist yet. A comprehensive study of previous will be first address. Later author will point out the in-adequacy of skin effect and proximity effect as cause of current crowding in the inductor metal. A model method embedded with new explanation of current crowding is proposed and its applicability in differential inductor and balun is validated. This study leads to a robust optimization routine to improve inductor performance without any addition technology cost and development.",
