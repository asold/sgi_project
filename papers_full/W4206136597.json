    "abstract": "In this study, we present design guidelines (DGs) for the development and improvement of a virtual collaborator (VC) for Design Thinking (DT). Based on interviews in an ex ante study, we designed a first prototype of a VC. From an ex post evaluation using focus group discussions, we derive strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the VC. Strengths of the VC are good structure, giving inspiration as well as pace and accuracy. Opportunities are to set level of detail, give a more humane representation, and linking search with other DT phases. Weaknesses are not always suitable content and the VC being rather suitable for research phases as well as one-sided communication and no empathy. Threats are questionable search parameters and too narrow focus of search. We then derived DGs for further improvement of the VC, addressing the weaknesses, threats and ideas from participants.",
