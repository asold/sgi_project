Wheeler, PhD1, Karynne Patterson, BS1, Sean McGee, PhD1,\nRachel Dalton, PharmD2, Erica L. Woodahl, PhD2, Andrea Gaedigk, PhD3,\nKenneth E. Thummel, PhD4 and Deborah A. Nickerson, PhD1,5\nPurpose: Genotyping CYP2D6 is important for precision drug\ntherapy because the enzyme it encodes metabolizes approximately\n25% of drugs, and its activity varies considerably among\nindividuals. Genotype analysis of CYP2D6 is challenging due to\nits highly polymorphic nature. Over 100 haplotypes (star alleles)\nhave been defined forCYP2D6, some involving a gene conversion\nwith its nearby nonfunctional but highly homologous paralog\nCYP2D7. We present Stargazer, a new bioinformatics tool that uses\nnext-generation sequencing (NGS) data to call star alleles for\nCYP2D6 (https://stargazer.gs.washington.edu/stargazerweb/). Star-\ngazer is currently being extended for other pharmacogenes.\nMethods: Stargazer identifies star alleles from NGS data by\ndetecting single nucleotide variants, insertion-deletion variants, and\nstructural variants. Stargazer detects structural variation, including\ngene deletions, duplications, and conversions, by calculating\nparalog-specific copy numbers from read depths.\nResults: We applied Stargazer to the NGS data of 32 ethnically\ndiverse HapMap trios that were genotyped by TaqMan assays, long-\nrange polymerase chain reaction, quantitative multiplex polymerase\nchain reaction, high-resolution melting analysis, and/or Sanger\nsequencing. CYP2D6 genotyping by Stargazer was 99.0% concordant\nwith the data obtained by these methods, and showed that 28.1% of the\nsamples had structural variation includingCYP2D6/CYP2D7hybrids.\nConclusion:Accurate genotyping of pharmacogenes with NGS and\nsubsequent allele calling with Stargazer will aid the implementation of\nprecision drug therapy.\nGenetics in Medicine(2019) 21:361–372; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41436-\n018-0054-0\nKeywords: CYP2D6 genotyping; next-generation sequencing;\npharmacogenomics; star alleles; structural variation\nINTRODUCTION\nMany cytochrome P450 enzymes play a role in pharmacolo-\ngical responses by contributing to the metabolism of\nnumerous drugs. Among these, cytochrome P450 2D6\n(CYP2D6) is considered one of the most important because\nit contributes to the metabolism of about 25% of drugs.\n1\nDrugs metabolized by CYP2D6 include opioids, chemother-\napeutic agents, antidepressants, and antipsychotics, among\nothers.\n2\nThe activity of CYP2D6 varies considerably between\nindividuals due to the high level of polymorphisms observed\nin the CYP2D6 gene. There are more than 100 haplotypes\ndefined for CYP2D6 by the Pharmacogene Variation Con-\nsortium.3 These are called star alleles (e.g.,CYP2D6*1, *2, etc.)\nand are characterized by single nucleotide variants (SNVs),\ninsertion-deletion variants (indels), structural variants (SVs),\nor a combination of these. They include fully functional,\ndecreased-function, and nonfunctional alleles, which provide\na wide spectrum of CYP2D6 enzymatic activity ranging from\nultrarapid to poor metabolism. Different ethnic groups have\ndistinct frequencies of star alleles and metabolic phenotypes;\n4\nhowever, further studies are warranted for individuals of\nAfrican or Asian ancestry because these populations are\nunderrepresented in the estimation of CYP2D6 genetic\ndiversity.\n5\nDrug therapy without preemptive knowledge of a patient’s\nCYP2D6 phenotype status can lead to severe adverse reactions\nor a loss of efficacy due to inappropriate drug choice and/or\ndosing. For example, codeine is one of the most common and\nwidely used opioids whose analgesic effect is elicited by\nCYP2D6 through the formation of morphine. Patients who\nare CYP2D6 poor metabolizers exhibit very low plasma\nconcentrations of morphine following codeine administration,\nwhich can complicate their pain management because the\naffinity of morphine to the μ-opioid receptor is 200-fold\nstronger compared with that of codeine.\n6 Conversely, a\npatient can experience life-threatening morphine intoxication\nafter receiving a small dose of codeine if they are a CYP2D6\nultrarapid metabolizer.\n7 Similarly, a breastfed infant died\nfrom morphine poisoning because the mother was prescribed\na normal dose of codeine for childbirth-related pain. In this\ncase, the mother was a CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolizer\nSubmitted 12 January 2018; accepted: 23 April 2018\nPublished online: 6 June 2018\n1Department of Genome Sciences, School of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA;2Department of Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of\nMontana, Missoula, Montana, USA;3Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Toxicology and Therapeutic Innovation, Children’s Mercy Kansas City, Kansas City, Missouri, USA;\n4Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmacy, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA;5Brotman Baty Institute for Precision Medicine, Seattle, Washington,\nUSA.

When theCYP2D6 haplotype calls of Stargazer were compared with those determined by the orthogonal methods, the concordance rate\nwas 99.0% (190 out of 192 haplotypes). The two discordant haplotypes were found in samples NA19200 and NA19202 of the Y045 trio (indicated by parentheses). Predicted phenotypes were assigned based on the\nactivity score and Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium guidelines.\nARTICLE LEE et al.\n364 Volume 21 | Number 2 | February 2019 | GENETICS in MEDICINE\npassing a toxic amount of morphine to her newborn through\nher breast milk.8\nFor these reasons, there is considerable interest in\ngenotyping CYP2D6. However, genotype analysis ofCYP2D6\nis complex because a large fraction of its existing variation\ncannot be accurately assessed with a single approach. SVs in\nCYP2D6, such as gene deletions, duplications, and conver-\nsions, are particularly challenging to detect due to high\nsequence homology (>95%) with a nonfunctional paralog,\nCYP2D7, located upstream ofCYP2D6.\n9 Therefore, CYP2D6\nis prone to genotype misclassification and incorrect pheno-\ntype prediction.\n10 In laboratory settings, several orthogonal\ngenotyping methods, such as TaqMan assays, long-range\npolymerase chain reaction (PCR), quantitative multiplex PCR,\nhigh-resolution melting analysis, and Sanger sequencing, are\nemployed to call star alleles. However, many of these methods\nare time consuming and heavily biased toward the detection\nof known variants. In clinical settings, due to practical\nlimitations, only a handful of major star alleles, if any, are\ntested. Hence, a new approach for genotyping CYP2D6 is\nneeded that is more robust and capable of higher throughput.\nIn this study, we developed Stargazer, a new bioinformatics\ntool for calling star alleles inCYP2D6 from next-generation\nsequencing (NGS) data. NGS is a powerful platform for\nvariant detection because of its high-throughput data\ngeneration, comprehensive genotyping capabilities, and\never-decreasing cost. Additionally, NGS does not require\nprevious knowledge about the variants of interest, and can\nuncover novel functional variants, which is not possible for\nmany of the aforementioned genotyping methods. Further-\nmore, its cost-effectiveness can be increased for variant\ndiscovery by applying custom capture panels. To assess the\naccuracy of Stargazer, we applied it to the NGS data of 32\nethnically diverse HapMap trios. We report a correlation of\n99.0% between CYP2D6 genotype calls determined with\nStargazer and by orthogonal methods. We are now extending\nStargazer to call star alleles for other clinically important\npharmacogenes. Accurate diplotype calls from NGS data\nusing Stargazer provide a promising approach for precision\nmedicine to maximize drug efficacy and minimize toxicity for\nindividual patients. Stargazer is publicly accessible through\nhttps://stargazer.gs.washington.edu/stargazerweb/.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nSamples\nWe built Stargazer using NGS data from 32 ethnically diverse\ntrios. These trios were selected from the International\nHapMap Project, and they are comprised of 13 European, 5\nYoruban, 4 African American, 3 Han Chinese, 3 Mexican\nAmerican, 2 Peruvian, and 2 Puerto Rican families (Table1).\nThese trios were originally sequenced to assess the perfor-\nmance of PGRNseq, a recently developed custom capture\npanel of key pharmacogenes includingCYP2D6.\n11 They were\nspecifically chosen for this study because they are a genetically\ndiverse set of samples in which we would likely encounter a\nwide range of CYP2D6 variants, including SVs, to test\nStargazer’s genotyping abilities and limitations. In addition,\nthese trios allow for the analysis of Mendelian inheritance\npatterns to further the validation of Stargazer’s star allele calls.\nThese trios were also previously genotyped forCYP2D6 by a\nvariety of orthogonal methods (see below), allowing us to\nassess the accuracy of Stargazer’s diplotype calls.\nOrthogonal genotyping methods\nHapMap trios were genotyped for CYP2D6 according to\nprocedures described elsewhere.12–15 Briefly, SNVs and indels\nwere detected using TaqMan assays. Gene deletions, duplica-\ntions, and multiplications were assessed by long-range PCR\nand quantitative multiplex PCR. CYP2D6/CYP2D7 hybrids\nwere identified using quantitative multiplex PCR, high-\nresolution melting analysis, and/or Sanger sequencing.\nCustom capture panel and NGS\nHapMap trios were sequenced twice— once with PGRNseq\nv1.1 and once with PGRNseq v2.0— to a mean coverage of\n~400× and ~160×, respectively. Both sequencing runs were\nperformed with Illumina HiSeq 2500 machines using 100-\nbase pair (pb) paired-end reads. Three samples failed during\none of the two sequencing runs: NA19835 in PGRNseq v1.1,\nStructural variants\nRaw sequence reads \nDiplotypes\nStar alleles\nCopy numberPhased haplotypes\nRead depthSNVs/indels\nBAM files \nBWA-MEM \nVCF file Target/control GDF files\nGATK-Haplotype caller\nBeagle\nChange point\nStargazer \nGATK-Depth of coverage \nActivity scores\nPredicted phenotypes\nFig. 1 Schematic diagram of the Stargazer CYP2D6 genotyping\npipeline.

Note that the\nprobes designed to captureCYP2D6 and CYP2D7 were more\nspecific and extensive in PGRNseq v2.0 compared with\nPGRNseq v1.1; however, both versions generated reads that\nmapped to all the exons, introns, untranslated regions, and\npromoters ofCYP2D6 and CYP2D7 (Supplementary Figure S1\nonline). Two samples, NA12878 and NA19238, were also\npreviously sequenced by genome sequencing (WGS) to a\nmean coverage of ~30× with Illumina HiSeq X instruments\nusing 150-bp paired-end reads. These data were used to test\nStargazer’s generalizability to WGS data.\nInput and output data of Stargazer\nThe Stargazer CYP2D6 genotyping pipeline is outlined in\nFigure 1. The pipeline uses BAM files comprising sequence\nreads aligned with BWA-MEM to human reference genome\nassembly GRCh37.16 BAM files are then used to generate a\nVCF file with GATK-HaplotypeCaller (v3.4),17 from which\nStargazer extracts all SNVs and indels located within 3\nkilobases (kb) from either end ofCYP2D6. More specifically,\nStargazer stores the genomic position of each variant,\nreference allele, alternate allele(s), genotype status (homo-\nzygous or heterozygous), and allelic depth for each sample.\nStargazer uses the variant information from the VCF file to\ncall star alleles based on SNVs and indels.\nBAM files are also used to calculate read depth forCYP2D6\nand CYP2D7 with GATK-DepthOfCoverage (v3.4).\n17 For\nconvenience, we will refer to this output as a target GDF\n(GATK-DepthOfCoverage format) file. Since the high homol-\nogy betweenCYP2D6 and CYP2D7 can cause reads to align to\nerroneous or multiple locations, only uniquely mapping reads\nwith a mapping quality≥20 are counted. Similarly, a control\nGDF file is produced from a user-chosen locus, which serves\nas a read depth normalization factor.

These genes\nare covered by PGRNseq and are 63, 154, and 188 kb in size,\nrespectively. They are also reported to exhibit low rates of\nwhole gene deletion and/or duplication according to the\nDatabase of Genomic Variants.\n18 All three genes produced the\nsame copy number results for CYP2D6 and CYP2D7. The\nanalyses shown in the results section were all performed using\nRYR1 as the control locus.\nThe output data of Stargazer include each sample’s CYP2D6\ndiplotype, predicted phenotype, and plots to visually inspect\ncopy number forCYP2D6 and CYP2D7 (Figure 2). Note that\nwhen calling diplotypes, Stargazer only considers those\nvariants that are currently used by the Pharmacogene\nVariation Consortium. Stargazer also returns all detected\nSNVs and indels, including those that are novel and those that\nare known but not currently used to define any star allele. As\nfollow-up, these variants can be functionally annotated using\nvariant annotation tools such as SeattleSeq Annotation\n(http://snp.gs.washington.edu/SeattleSeqAnnotation).\nPrediction of star alleles\nFrom a VCF file, Stargazer uses Beagle (v4.1)19 to haplotype\nphase heterozygous variants for CYP2D6 with over 2,500\nreference samples from the 1000 Genomes Project. Stargazer\nthen matches phased haplotypes to star alleles using a\ntranslation table built from publicly available data (https://\nwww.pharmvar.org). The table contains information on more\nthan 90 star alleles and 185 SNVs and indels, including\nvariant positions and nucleotide changes in relation to the\nreference CYP2D6*1 allele and human reference genome\nassembly GRCh37.\nDetection of SVs\nFrom a target GDF file, Stargazer converts read depths for\nCYP2D6 and CYP2D7 to copy numbers by performing intra-\n42534000 42538000\nCoordinate\n6\nab\n4\n2\n0\nCopy number\n6\n4\n2\n0\nCopy number\n6\n4\n2\n0\nCopy number\n6\n4\n2\n0\nCopy number\n4254200042520000 42524000\nCoordinate\n4252800042534000 42538000\nCoordinate\n4254200042520000 42524000\nCoordinate\n42528000\n42534000 42538000\nCoordinate\n4254200042520000 42524000\nCoordinate\n4252800042534000 42538000\nCoordinate\n4254200042520000 42524000\nCoordinate\n42528000\n42534000 42538000\nCoordinate\n4254200042520000 42524000\nCoordinate\n4252800042534000 42538000\nCoordinate\n4254200042520000 42524000\nCoordinate\n42528000\n6\n4\n2\n0\nCopy number\n6\n4\n2\n0\nCopy number\n6\n4\n2\n0\nCopy number\n6\n4\n2\n0\nCopy number\n6\n4\n2\n0\nCopy number\n6\n4\n2\n0\nCopy number\n6\n4\n2\n0\nCopy number\n6\n4\n2\n0\nCopy number\nFig. 3 Segregation of complex structural variations detected by Stargazer in two HapMap trios. aSegregation of CYP2D6*78 + *2 in the\nMexican American M037 family.b Segregation ofCYP2D6*68 + *4 in the European 1463 family.

ARTICLE\nGENETICS in MEDICINE| Volume 21 | Number 2 | February 2019 367\nand intersample normalizations. Intrasample normalization\naccounts for individual variation in the sequencing efficiency\nusing read depth from a control GDF file, while the\nintersample normalization considers the heterogeneity in\ncoverage across all samples. Stargazer then automates the\ndetection of SVs with changepoint (v2.2.2) — an R\npackage that approximates one or more points at which the\nstatistical properties of a sequence of observations change.\n20\nHere, the sequence is DNA, the observation is per-\nbase copy number, and the statistical property is the mean\ncopy number. If there is a significant shift in the mean copy\nnumber (e.g., from two to one), the algorithm returns the\nchange point location and the two mean values (e.g., two and\none).\nIdentification of diplotypes\nFor samples without SVs, Stargazer determines CYP2D6\ndiplotypes by combining the star allele used to assign each\nphased haplotype. For samples with a whole gene deletion, the\naffected haplotype is assigned theCYP2D6*5 deletion allele,\nwhich is then combined with the star allele assigned to the\nother haplotype to form a diplotype. For samples with a whole\ngene duplication, the affected haplotype is assigned“×2” (e.g.,\nCYP2D6*1 ×2 ,*2 × 2, etc.) because it has two gene copies of\nCYP2D6. For samples with more complex SVs, such as\nCYP2D6/CYP2D7 hybrids, individual algorithms have been\ndeveloped to determine diplotypes. The identification of\ndiplotypes is discussed in more detail, in the context of\nHapMap trios, in the results section.\nAssignment of predicted phenotypes\nThere are four CYP2D6 metabolizer classes: poor, inter-\nmediate, normal, and ultrarapid. To predict these phenotypes,\nStargazer first translates CYP2D6 diplotypes into a standard\nunit of enzyme activity known as an activity score.\n21 The fully\nfunctional reference CYP2D6*1 allele is assigned a value of 1,\ndecreased-function alleles such asCYP2D6*10 and *17 receive\na value of 0.5, and nonfunctional alleles includingCYP2D6*4\nand *5 have a value of 0. The sum of values assigned to both\nalleles constitutes the activity score of a diplotype. Conse-\nquently, subjects with CYP2D6*1/*1, *1/*4, and *4/*5\ndiplotypes have an activity score of 2, 1, and 0, respectively.\nThese activity scores are used to predict the four metabolizer\nclasses as follows: poor, 0; intermediate, 0.5; normal, 1–2; and\nultrarapid, >2.\nRESULTS\nIdentification of diplotypes by Stargazer for HapMap trios\nWe used Stargazer (v1.0.0) to call CYP2D6 diplotypes\nfor 32 HapMap trios sequenced with PGRNseq (Table 1).\nData from PGRNseq v1.1 and PGRNseq v2.0 served\nas technical validation and produced the same diplotype\ncalls for all samples. Moreover, all diplotype calls\nwere inherited in a predictable manner, as exemplified in\nFigure 3. Diplotypes were identified using the following\nalgorithms.\nFor samples without SVs, diplotypes were determined by\ncombining the star allele assigned to each of the two\nhaplotypes. For example, phasing algorithms estimated from\nsubject NA12805 two haplotypes — of which one matched\nCYP2D6*2 and the other *4— to form a CYP2D6*2/*4\ndiplotype (Figure 2a).\nFor samples with a whole gene deletion, diplotypes were\ndetermined such that one haplotype contained theCYP2D6*5\ndeletion allele while the other was assigned a star allele based\non detected SNVs and indels. For example, subject NA18508\nhad only oneCYP2D6 gene copy, and all detected SNVs were\nhemizygous and matched CYP2D6*2. Stargazer called this\nsample as having aCYP2D6*2/*5 diplotype (Figure 2b).\nFor samples with a whole gene duplication, Stargazer\nresolved the identity of the extraCYP2D6 gene copy in the\naffected haplotypes. For example, Stargazer detected three\ngene copies in subject NA19685 with a CYP2D6*1/*2\ndiplotype (Figure 2c). This sample could tentatively have a\nduplication on theCYP2D6*1 or *2 allele, or in other words\ncould have a CYP2D6*1 ×2 /*2 or *1/*2 × 2 diplotype.\nStargazer used the allelic depth ratios of the SNVs defining\nthe CYP2D6*2 allele to determine which allele carried the\nduplication. If theCYP2D6*2 allele carried the extra copy, the\nsample would have a read ratio of 2:1 reads for the respective\nSNVs. Indeed, most samples that were heterozygous for these\nSNVs had read ratios close to 1, whereas NA19685 was a\nsignificant outlier with an average ratio of 2.4 from the\nPGRNseq 1.1 data. Stargazer called the sample as having a\nCYP2D6*1/*2 × 2. The read ratio approach can also be used to\ndistinguish between diplotypes having duplications on both\nalleles and those having multiple copies on one allele (e.g.,\nCYP2D6*1 ×2 /*2 × 2 vs.*1/*2 × 3).\nFor samples with complex structural variation, diplotypes\nwere called using individual algorithms. For example,\nCYP2D6*68 + *4 is a tandem duplication where the\nCYP2D6*4 gene copy is defined by only one SNV while\nCYP2D6*68 is a hybrid gene featuring aCYP2D7 sequence\nfrom intron 1 onward and four CYP2D6 SNVs before the\nbreakpoint. Stargazer called one of the two haplotypes of\nHG01979 as having this tandem structure because all five\nSNVs were detected, they were haplotype phased together,\nand the conversion toCYP2D7 was also observed (Figure2d).\nThe other haplotype was matched to\nCYP2D6*2 and Stargazer\ncalled this sample as having aCYP2D6*2/*68 + *4 diplotype.\nSimilar approaches were employed to determine diplotypes\ninvolving other tandem duplications, such asCYP2D6*36 +\n*10 (Figure 2e) and *78 + *2 (Figure 2f), where the\nCYP2D6*36 and *78 alleles each contain a gene conversion\nto CYP2D7.\nFor samples with more than one SV, Stargazer tested all\npossible pairwise combinations of SVs to determine diplo-\ntypes. More specifically, Stargazer first fit every combination\nof SVs against a sample’s observed CYP2D6 and CYP2D7\ncopy number profiles and then selected the combination that\nproduced the least deviance. For example, HG00463 and\nHG00465 (family SH021) carry both a gene duplication and a\nARTICLE LEE et al.\n368 Volume 21 | Number 2 | February 2019 | GENETICS in MEDICINE\ngene conversion on each of their chromosomes, and their\nprofiles are best explained as having a CYP2D6*36 + *10\ntandem arrangement on each chromosome (Supplementary\nFigure S2a,b online). There was one additional sample with\nmultiple SVs— HG01190— whose profile was best explained by\nthe combination of aCYP2D6*5 deletion andCYP2D6*68+*4\n(Supplementary Figure S2c).\nSummary of genotype and phenotype calls by Stargazer for\nHapMap trios\nStargazer called 20 unique haplotypes from the 32 HapMap\ntrios. The frequencies of these haplotypes in the 64 unrelated\nparents are shown in Supplementary Table S1 online. As\nexpected, fully functional CYP2D6*1 and *2 alleles had the\nhighest frequencies (31.3 and 18.8%, respectively) among the\nparents, followed by the nonfunctional CYP2D6*4 allele\n(8.6%). Stargazer also detectedCYP2D6*17 (7.0%), which is\ncommonly found in subjects of African ancestry including\nAfrican Americans, and CYP2D6*10 (2.3%), which occurs\nmost frequently in East Asians. BothCYP2D6*17 and *10 are\ndecreased-function alleles. In addition, Stargazer identified\nmany haplotypes with structural variation in the parents: 4.7%\nwith a gene deletion ( CYP2D6*5), 11.7% with a gene\nduplication (CYP2D6*2 ×2 ,*4 ×2 ,*4 N+ *4, *10 ×2 ,*36 +\n*10, *68 + *4, and*78 + *2), and 8.6% with a gene conversion\n(CYP2D6*4 N, *36, *68,a n d*78). This translates to 9.4, 21.9,\nand 15.6% of the parents having at least one gene deletion,\nduplication, or conversion, respectively. Based on the\ndiplotype calls, 4.7, 10.9, 82.8, and 1.6% of the parents were\npredicted to be poor, intermediate, normal, and ultrarapid\nmetabolizers, respectively.\nComparison between Stargazer and orthogonal\ngenotyping methods\nWhen the CYP2D6 haplotype calls of Stargazer were\ncompared with those determined by orthogonal methods,\n42534000 42538000\nCoordinate\n4254200042520000 42524000\nCoordinate\n4252800042534000 42538000\nCoordinate\n42542000\n6\na\nb\nc\n4\n2\n0\nCopy number\n6\n4\n2\n0\nCopy number\n6\n4\n2\n0\nCopy number\n6\n4\n2\n0\nCopy number\n42520000 42524000\nCoordinate\n42528000\n42534000 42538000\nCoordinate\n4254200042520000 42524000\nCoordinate\n4252800042534000 42538000\nCoordinate\n4254200042520000 42524000\nCoordinate\n42528000\n42534000 42538000\nCoordinate\n4254200042520000 42524000\nCoordinate\n4252800042534000 42538000\nCoordinate\n4254200042520000 42524000\nCoordinate\n42528000\n6\n4\n2\n0\nCopy number\n6\n4\n2\n0\nCopy number\n6\n4\n2\n0\nCopy number\n6\n4\n2\n0\nCopy number\n6\n4\n2\n0\nCopy number\n6\n4\n2\n0\nCopy number\n6\n4\n2\n0\nCopy number\n6\n4\n2\n0\nCopy number\nFig. 4 Comparison of custom capture and genome sequencing. a– c Two subjects, NA19238 and NA12878, were sequenced witha PGRNseq v1.1 at\n~400× coverage with 100-base pair (bp) paired-end reads,b PGRNseq v2.0 at ~160× coverage with 100-bp paired-end reads, andc genome sequencing at\n~30× coverage with 150-bp paired-end reads.

In all three cases, Stargazer called the correct\ndiplotypes: CYP2D6*1/*17 and *3/*68 + *4, respectively\nLEE et al. ARTICLE\nGENETICS in MEDICINE| Volume 21 | Number 2 | February 2019 369\nthe concordance rate was 99.0% (190 out of 192 haplotypes;\nTable 1). The two discordant haplotypes were found in\nNA19200 and NA19202 from the Y045 trio. For these\nsamples, the orthogonal methods calledCYP2D6*5/*76 + *1\nand CYP2D6*1/*76 + *1 diplotypes, respectively, while Star-\ngazer called CYP2D6*1/*5 and CYP2D6*1/*1 diplotypes. The\nnonfunctional CYP2D6*76 allele— a CYP2D6/CYP2D7 hybrid\n— was identified using long-range PCR and Sanger sequen-\ncing. The allele is essentially a CYP2D7 gene that has a\nCYP2D6 downstream sequence with a switch region to\nCYP2D6 past exon 9, and lacks aCYP2D7-specific sequence\nalso referred to as‘spacer.’\n22 Since this allele has aCYP2D6-\nspecific sequence, it may produce positive results with some\nlong-range PCR reactions that are deemed diagnostic for the\npresence of a gene duplication. Nonetheless, Stargazer did not\ndetect any significant change in copy number either at the\nswitch region or in the spacer, so the program did not call\nCYP2D6*76 (Supplementary Figure S3 online). Note that the\nphenotype prediction is the same whether the allele is\ndetected or not.\nStargazer calls using WGS data\nTo assess the performance of Stargazer on WGS data, we\nevaluated two samples (NA19238 and NA12878) that were\nsequenced with PGRNseq v1.1, PGRNseq v2.0, and WGS.\nAlthough NA12878 carried a CYP2D6*68 + *4 tandem\nduplication, Stargazer called the same diplotypes regardless\nof the sequencing platform (Figure4).\nTesting Stargazer at various sequencing coverages\nWe applied Stargazer to simulated datasets generated by\nrandomly downsampling sequence reads from PGRNseq v2.0\ndata (Supplementary Table S2 online). When 15% of reads\nwere used (corresponding to 23.7× coverage), 186 out of 188\nhaplotypes were correctly called; the two misclassified\nhaplotypes carried an SV. However, the misclassifications\ndid not affect the phenotype prediction. Based on these\nresults, our recommendation is to use Stargazer for datasets\nwith a mean read coverage greater than 20×.\nSNVs and indels detected by NGS\nFrom the PGRNseq v1.1 and PGRNseq v2.0 data, 142 SNVs\nand indels were detected at 138 loci within 3 kb from either\nend ofCYP2D6, 86 of which are not currently used to define\nstar alleles (Supplementary Table S3 online). Among these—\naccording to SeattleSeq Annotation — five are missense\npathogenic variants while the remaining ones are either\nsynonymous or within the 3 ′ or 5′ untranslated region,\ndownstream or upstream of the gene, or within an intron. We\ndid not find any novel variants that are obviously detrimental\nto CYP2D6 function, such as nonsense, frameshift, or splice\nsite pathogenic variants.\nDISCUSSION\nWe developed Stargazer— a new software tool for calling star\nalleles in various polymorphic pharmacogenes from NGS\ndata. When building Stargazer, we usedCYP2D6 as a model\nfor the detection and interpretation of SVs in the context of\nother observed SNVs and indels. We purposefully chose\nCYP2D6 as a starting point because it is one of the most\ncomplex genetic loci to genotype in the human genome. Two\nother programs— Cypiripi and Astrolabe— have been pub-\nlished to genotype CYP2D6 from NGS data.\n23, 24 Although\nboth tools can reliably call simple diplotypes, they have\ndifficulties with the detection of complex SVs, such as\nCYP2D6/CYP2D7 hybrids. We show that Stargazer can\nreliably detect those hybrids from targeted or WGS data.\nMore specifically, we show that Stargazer correctly\ngenotyped CYP2D6 for 32 ethnically diverse HapMap trios.\nThese trios were previously validated by a variety of\northogonal methods, and comparisons show that Stargazer\nis 99.0% concordant with these methods. In the future, we will\ntest additional verified samples in order to further validate\nStargazer’s performance. All diplotype calls by Stargazer were\ninherited according to expectations including population-\nspecific star alleles such asCYP2D6*10 and *17. Stargazer also\nproduced the same diplotype calls for all samples from the\ntwo independent PGRNseq v1.1 and PGRNseq v2.0 datasets.\nWe plan to extend Stargazer toCYP2A6— another highly\npolymorphic pharmacogene displaying many SNVs and\nindels as well as SVs. CYP2A6 metabolizes nicotine, and\nsequence variation in CYP2A6 has been linked to nicotine\ndependence and withdrawal symptoms upon smoking cessa-\ntion.\n25 Similar to CYP2D6, CYP2A6 has several star alleles\nwith a gene conversion to its nearby paralogCYP2A7.26 We\nalso plan to develop Stargazer for other cytochrome P450\ngenes.\nAs larger genomic datasets become available, several aspects\nof Stargazer will improve. These include the statistical\nestimation of phased haplotypes, primarily haplotypes based\non rare variants. In the current version of Stargazer, we\nincorporated a large panel of reference samples from the 1000\nGenomes Project. This approach performed well for our\ndataset, but we are aware that in further applications, rare\nvariants may have frequencies that are too low to be phased\nreliably. To ameliorate this issue, we plan to merge multiple\nlarge reference panels to obtain additional haplotype informa-\ntion. Novel variants will require physical phasing backed by\nsequence reads. When short reads cannot provide adequate\nphasing, long-read sequencing from Oxford Nanopore\nTechnologies or Pacific Biosciences can be used to generate\nreference haplotype information. Recently, both technologies\nhave been successfully applied to sequenceCYP2D6.\n27, 28\nCertain features of Stargazer are specific for targeted\nsequencing such as PGRNseq. For example, for the purpose\nof normalization, Stargazer requires multiple samples to be\nanalyzed at a time. This is because sequencing with custom\ncapture typically yields uneven coverage across the genes of\ninterest, and Stargazer’s copy number estimation is based on\npopulation statistics. If the sample size is too small or a large\nfraction of samples share the same type of structural variation,\npopulation statistics can be shifted dramatically, generating\nARTICLE LEE et al.\n370 Volume 21 | Number 2 | February 2019 | GENETICS in MEDICINE\nbiased copy number data. However, this problem can be\naddressed by including reference samples with known copy\nnumbers. For WGS data, where coverage is usually distributed\nmore evenly, the intersample normalization may be skipped,\nallowing Stargazer to analyze a single sample.\nWe reported five missense variants that are not currently\nused to define any star allele. However, interpretation of these\nvariants is difficult without functional characterization. In\nfact, the same is true for many variants in existing star alleles\n(e.g., CYP2D6*22 is defined by a nonsynonymous SNV in\nexon 9 with unknown effect). Therefore, there is clearly a need\nto more rigorously characterize the function of the rapidly\nincreasing number of haplotypes to facilitate phenotype\nprediction. In the future, it is possible that data from deep\nmutational scanning for the CYP2D6 enzyme could be\nincorporated into Stargazer to aid the characterization of\nthe functional consequences of all possible single pathogenic\nvariants of this protein.\n29\nThe HapMap trios used in this study consist of seven\ndistinct ethnic groups and therefore represent a sampling of\nthe global distribution of CYP2D6 genotypes. Characterized\nby multiple genotyping platforms including NGS, these trios\ncan serve as a reference resource for other CYP2D6\ngenotyping projects.\nThere is growing awareness of individual variation in drug\nresponse. For example, in March 2013, the Food and Drug\nAdministration cautioned against the use of codeine in\nchildren of any age to treat pain after surgery to remove the\ntonsils or adenoids.\n30 Shortly after, a prospective study\nshowed that children who were CYP2D6 ultrarapid meta-\nbolizers and taking codeine after those surgeries were at a\nhigher risk for toxicity and death.\n31 In April 2017, the Food\nand Drug Administration issued the agency ’s strongest\nwarning against codeine, alerting that the medication should\nnot be used to treat pain or cough in children younger than\n12 years. While limiting the therapeutic use of codeine\naddresses the concern for patient safety, tailoring codeine or\nother drug treatments based on an individual ’s CYP2D6\ngenotype could achieve the same goal. There may also be\ntherapeutic settings where alternative treatments are not fully\ninterchangeable and health outcomes could suffer from\nrestrictions in drug choice. For example, national guidelines\nrecommend codeine as a front-line drug for the treatment of\npain in patients with sickle cell disease, and many hematol-\nogists prefer codeine to other analgesics that have comparable\nefficacy but higher potential for abuse and physical depen-\ndence.\n32 With additional validation, Stargazer may offer an\nalternative approach for optimizing treatment response in all\npatients.\nELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL\nThe online version of this article (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41436-\n018-0054-0) contains supplementary material, which is available\nto authorized users.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors acknowledge the Pharmacogenomics Research\nNetwork for supporting the development of PGRNseq.
