  "abstract": "Background Prevention of suicide is a global health priority. Approximately 800,000 individuals die by suicide yearly, and for every suicide death, there are another 20 estimated suicide attempts. Large language models (LLMs) hold the potential to enhance scalable, accessible, and affordable digital services for suicide prevention and self-harm interventions. However, their use also raises clinical and ethical questions that require careful consideration. Objective This scoping review aims to identify emergent trends in LLM applications in the field of suicide prevention and self-harm research. In addition, it summarizes key clinical and ethical considerations relevant to this nascent area of research. Methods Searches were conducted in 4 databases (PsycINFO, Embase, PubMed, and IEEE Xplore) in February 2024. Eligible studies described the application of LLMs for suicide or self-harm prevention, detection, or management. English-language peer-reviewed articles and conference proceedings were included, without date restrictions. Narrative synthesis was used to synthesize study characteristics, objectives, models, data sources, proposed clinical applications, and ethical considerations. This review adhered to the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) standards. Results Of the 533 studies identified, 36 (6.8%) met the inclusion criteria. An additional 7 studies were identified through citation chaining, resulting in 43 studies for review. The studies showed a bifurcation of publication fields, with varying publication norms between computer science and mental health. While most of the studies (33/43, 77%) focused on identifying suicide risk, newer applications leveraging generative functions (eg, support, education, and training) are emerging. Social media was the most common source of LLM training data. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) was the predominant model used, although generative pretrained transformers (GPTs) featured prominently in generative applications. Clinical LLM applications were reported in 60% (26/43) of the studies, often for suicide risk detection or as clinical assistance tools. Ethical considerations were reported in 33% (14/43) of the studies, with privacy, confidentiality, and consent strongly represented. Conclusions This evolving research area, bridging computer science and mental health, demands a multidisciplinary approach. While open access models and datasets will likely shape the field of suicide prevention, documenting their limitations and potential biases is crucial. High-quality training data are essential for refining these models and mitigating unwanted biases. Policies that address ethical concerns—particularly those related to privacy and security when using social media data—are imperative. Limitations include high variability across disciplines in how LLMs and study methodology are reported. The emergence of generative artificial intelligence signals a shift in approach, particularly in applications related to care, support, and education, such as improved crisis care and gatekeeper training methods, clinician copilot models, and improved educational practices. Ongoing human oversight—through human-in-the-loop testing or expert external validation—is essential for responsible development and use.
