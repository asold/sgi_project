INTRODUCTION\nThe ﬁfth generation (5G) of wireless networks is under\nadvanced development and extensive research activities and\ntrials are ongoing to achieve its targeted expectations.\nSmall-cell base-stations are widely adopted to implement\nultra-dense networks (UDNs) to meet the requirements of\nexplosive data trafﬁc in 5G. The energy efﬁciency of these\ndevices is of paramount importance, which is primarily deter-\nmined by the efﬁciency of RF power ampliﬁers (PAs) in the\ntransmitter. The GaN technology with large power density\nand high efﬁciency is promising for such applications [1].\nIt also offers a potential for a higher-scale monolithic\nintegration.\nSpectrally efﬁcient modulation schemes with large peak-\nto-average power ratio (PAPR) and wide bandwidth are\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this article and approving\nit for publication was Yuhao Liu.\nemployed to accommodate the 5G network speeds approach-\ning tens of gigabits per second (Gb/s). The Doherty power\nampliﬁer (DPA) is an effective architecture to achieve high\naverage efﬁciency in dealing with such signals [2], [3].\nThe conventional DPAs suffer limited bandwidth mainly\narising from the load modulation network. Most notable\nbandwidth enhancement techniques developed for DPAs\ninclude modiﬁed characteristic impedance of transmission\nlines in the load modulation network, modiﬁed network\nfor the peaking transistor, parasitic capacitance compensa-\ntion, frequency response optimization, and dual-input DPA\narchitecture [3]. However, most of these solutions are only\napplicable to discrete circuits. In monolithic microwave\nintegrated circuit (MMIC) implementations, loss of passive\ncomponents, limited characteristic impedance of transmis-\nsion lines, and chip area limitations make most of these\nmethods rather ineffective, and call for special techniques for\nMMIC DPAs.\n119844 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Nikandishet al.: Bandwidth Enhancement of GaN MMIC Doherty Power Amplifiers\nSeveral GaN MMIC DPAs are reported in the literature\n[4]–[17], but most of them are narrow-band. A few broad-\nband design approaches were developed for MMIC DPAs\n[12]–[14]. In [12], output networks of the carrier and peak-\ning transistors are modiﬁed to maintain a low impedance-\ntransformation ratio and hence the DPA could achieve a\nbroad bandwidth. A drain efﬁciency (DE) of 48–62% is\nobtained at 7.6-dB back-off over 2.1–2.7 GHz (25%) band-\nwidth. However, the DPA is not fully integrated since the\ndrain bias inductors are realized using bond wires. This con-\ntributes to wider bandwidth and higher efﬁciency of the DPA.\nIn [13], a three-element network of transmission lines is pro-\nposed for integrated DPA implementations. A power-added\nefﬁciency (PAE) of 24–37% at 9-dB back-off is achieved\nover 6.8–8.5 GHz (22%) bandwidth. A power combining\noutput network with asymmetric drain biases is presented\nin [14] to help with extending the DPA bandwidth. At 9-dB\nback-off, 31–39% PAE is measured over 5.8–8.8 GHz (42%)\nbandwidth.\nIn this paper, we propose a bandwidth enhancement tech-\nnique for MMIC DPAs using a transformer-based load modu-\nlation network. We show that transformers can be effectively\nused in MMIC broadband ampliﬁer design [18]–[20] and\nthey can be realized as edge-coupled microstrip transmission\nlines in GaN process with beneﬁts of broad bandwidth and\nlow-loss. The transformer-based power combiners have been\nused for back-off efﬁciency enhancement [21] and in Doherty\nPA [22]. In those PA architectures, the transformer operates\nas a series voltage combiner that adds output voltages of the\nactive PA cells. Here, we propose a load-modulation network\nusing two transformers that improve frequency response of\nthe impedance presented to the carrier transistor at back-\noff to extend the DPA bandwidth. In the proposed network,\nthe circuit is transformed such that it can be realized using\ntransformers with unity turn ratio and therefore can be imple-\nmented using the edge-coupled microstrip transmission lines.\nThis paper is structured as follows. In Section II, we\ndescribe the bandwidth enhancement technique for MMIC\nDPAs and present a circuit composed of transformers and\noutput-referred parasitic capacitance of the transistors to\nprovide the load modulation. The circuit design details are\npresented in Section III. The DPA’s output network is realized\nusing the proposed broadband load modulation circuit, while\na meandered Lange coupler with broad bandwidth and com-\npact chip area is adopted as its input network. Measurement\nresults using continuous-wave (CW) and modulated signals\nare given in Section IV. Finally, conclusions are presented in\nSection V.\nII. BANDWIDTH ENHANCEMENT OF MMIC\nDOHERTY PAS\nA. BROADBAND LOAD MODULATION NETWORK\nARCHITECTURE\nA general DPA architecture is shown in Fig. 1, where the\ntwo two-port networks at the outputs of peaking and carrier\nFIGURE 1. General DPA architecture.\nampliﬁers provide optimum impedances at the peak power\nand back-off. The carrier network is realized to operate as\nan impedance inverter, while the peaking network is mainly\nused to compensate output parasitic impedance of the peaking\ntransistor. The output-referred parasitic capacitances of the\ntransistors are usually absorbed into these networks. In the\nconventional DPA architecture, the carrier network is realized\nas a quarter-wavelength transmission line (θ c =90◦), while\nno explicit two-port network is used at the output of peaking\nampliﬁer (θp =0). Bandwidth of the DPA is usually limited\nby the narrow-band response of the load modulation network,\ne.g., the impedance inverter, especially at the output power\nback-off where the impedance transformation ratio is large.\nA broadband DPA architecture can be developed by using\nthe phase shift provided by the peaking network θp (at center\nof the band) as a design parameter. Assuming that the two\nnetworks are realized as transmission lines with a charac-\nteristic impedance of Ropt and the load impedance is given\nby RL =Ropt /2, frequency response of the load impedance\npresented to the carrier network would be dependent on θp.\nIt is shown that θp = 180◦ extends the bandwidth of the\nDPA [23].\nThis DPA architecture can be realized by using a cascade\nof two quarter-wavelength transmission lines as the peaking\nampliﬁer network (Fig. 2) [24], which can also be imple-\nmented by using lumped elements [25]. Moreover, it was\nshown that, to achieve broadband efﬁciency at both back-\noff and peak power, the characteristic impedance of the\nFIGURE 2. Broadband DPA architecture with half-wavelength peaking\nnetwork.\nVOLUME 7, 2019 119845\nG. Nikandishet al.: Bandwidth Enhancement of GaN MMIC Doherty Power Amplifiers\ntransmission lines should be chosen as\nZ01 =Ropt\nm (1)\nZ02 = Ropt\nm√m (2)\nZ03 =Ropt√m (3)\nwhere m = √Ropt /2RL [26]. It is assumed that the car-\nrier and peaking transistors have the same optimum load\nresistance Ropt . The impedance transformation ratio for TL 1\nis derived as m2 at peak power and 4m 2 at 6-dB back-off,\nwhile for TL 2,3 it is given by m at peak power. Assuming\nthat the impedance transformers are lossless, output power\ndelivered to the load impedance at back-off would be the\nsame as the available power from the carrier transistor. The\ncarrier transistor can be fairly modeled as a current source\nin back-off (assuming that its output parasitic capacitance is\nincluded in the load modulation network), which delivers the\noutput power of Pout =Re[Zc,BO]I2\nm/2, where Zc,BO is the\nimpedance presented to the carrier transistor at back-off and\nIm denotes magnitude of the fundamental component of the\ndrain current waveform. Bandwidth of the load modulation\nnetwork at back-off can be deﬁned based on 20% reduction\nin real part of the impedance, roughly corresponding to 1 dB\ndrop in output power.\nBW =\n(\nf | Re[Zc,BO(f )]\n2Ropt\n>0.8\n)\n. (4)\nIn Fig. 3, real part of the impedance presented to the carrier\nampliﬁer at peak power and back-off is depicted for the\nconventional and broadband DPA architectures (assuming\nm =1). The fractional bandwidth for a 20% reduction in\nreal part of the impedance is included in the ﬁgure. The\nconventional DPA has a theoretically inﬁnite bandwidth at\npeak power but a limited 38% bandwidth at back-off. Using\nthe broadband DPA architecture, bandwidth at back-off is\nimproved to 72% (i.e., by the factor of 1.89).\nB. TRANSFORMER-BASED IMPEDANCE INVERTER\nConventionally, low-pass and high-pass equivalents of a\ntransmission line, shown in Fig. 4, are used as impedance\ninverters in integrated-circuit DPAs. The circuit components\nshould be selected as L =Z0/ω0 and C =1/ω0Z0 to approx-\nimate a quarter-wavelength transmission line of characteristic\nimpedance Z0. These circuits suffer from the following major\nlimitations.\n1) The required inductance can become very large, espe-\ncially for GaN processes with high Z0 (e.g., on the order\nof 100 ). Parasitic capacitances and losses of such\nlarge on-chip inductors can limit the DPA’s bandwidth\nand efﬁciency.\n2) The required capacitance is determined independently\nof the transistors’ output-referred capacitances, Co1,o2.\nThese circuits can only be used when Co1,o2 ≤C, and\nso an extra capacitance maybe needed for balancing.\nFIGURE 3. Comparison of real part of the impedance presented to the\ncarrier amplifier at (a) peak power and (b) back-off in the conventional\nand broadband DPA architectures.\nFIGURE 4. (a) Low-pass and (b) high-pass equivalent circuits of a\nquarter-wavelength transmission line conventionally used in DPAs.\n3) The circuit of Fig. 4(a) does not include an element\nfor the drain bias feed, while the circuit of Fig. 4(b)\nmay need large inductances with wide metal width.\nTherefore, the drain bias feed is usually implemented\nusing off-chip inductors or bond wires [10], [12].\n4) These circuits can only be used in symmetric DPAs\nwith equal Co1 and Co2. In asymmetric DPAs, extra\ncapacitors or inductors are needed to make the circuits\nsymmetric. However, this limits the DPA bandwidth.\n119846 VOLUME 7, 2019\nG. Nikandishet al.: Bandwidth Enhancement of GaN MMIC Doherty Power Amplifiers\nFIGURE 5. (a) General impedance inverter network including parasitic\ncapacitances. (b) Transformer-based impedance inverter circuit.\nA general impedance inverter network including the\noutput-referred parasitic capacitances can be considered as\nin Fig. 5(a), where the two-port network is represented by its\nimpedance parameters. This network is realized using linear\nand time-invariant passive components, thus it is reciprocal,\nand Z12 =Z21. The impedance parameters of the network\nshould be derived such that (along with C1 and C2) they\nconstitute an impedance inverter. The transfer matrix of the\nimpedance inverter network shown in Fig. 1 can be derived\nas\n[T ] =\n[ 1 0\njω0C1 1\n][ A B\nC D\n][ 1 0\njω0C2 1\n]\n, (5)\nwhere ABCD denote the transfer parameters of the two-port\nnetwork [27]. By equating this matrix with a transfer matrix\nof the quarter-wavelength transmission line given by\n[T ]λ/4 =\n\n\n0 jZ0\nj 1\nZ0\n0\n\n, (6)\nthe ABCD parameters are derived as follows\n[A B\nC D\n]\n=\n\n\nω0C2Z0 jZ0\nj( 1\nZ0\n−ω2\n0C1C2Z0) ω0C1Z0\n\n. (7)\nUsing this representation, it can be shown that the impedance\nparameters of the two-port network are\nZ11(ω0) = (ω0C2Z0)jZ0\nω2\n0C1C2Z2\n0 −1 (8)\nZ22(ω0) = (ω0C1Z0)jZ0\nω2\n0C1C2Z2\n0 −1 (9)\nZ12(ω0) =Z21(ω0) = jZ0\nω2\n0C1C2Z2\n0 −1. (10)\nThis description is useful to synthesize a variety of circuit\nstructures that can operate as the impedance inverter\nnetwork.1\n1This formulation can be used to analyze other circuits proposed in the\nliterature as the impedance inverter [10], [13], [14].\nUsing (8)–(10), some important insights can be derived\nabout the conditions that the two-port network of Fig. 5(a)\nshould meet. First, we note that Z11(ω0)/Z22(ω0) =C2/C1,\nindicating that the two-port network should exhibit input\nand output impedances with the same frequency dependency,\nscaled by the ratio of the two parasitic capacitances. Further-\nmore, all impedance parameters have the same sign, which\nis dependent on ω2\n0C1C2Z2\n0 . Assuming ω2\n0C1C2Z2\n0 > 1,\nall impedance parameters should be inductive. Based on\nthese observations, we propose the transformer-based cir-\ncuit shown in Fig. 5(b) as the impedance inverter. Using\nZ11(ω0) = jω0L1, Z22(ω0) = jω0L2, and Z12(ω0) =\nZ21(ω0) =jω0 km\n√\nL1 L2, the transformer’s parameters are\nderived as\nL1 = C2Z2\n0\nω2\n0C1C2Z2\n0 −1 (11)\nL2 = C1Z2\n0\nω2\n0C1C2Z2\n0 −1 (12)\nkm = 1\nω0\n√C1C2Z0\n. (13)\nThe transformer’s turn ratio, ntr =√L1/L2 =√C2/C1,\nis dependent on ratio of the two parasitic capacitances. In the\nDPA, the width ratio of the peaking to carrier transistor is\ndetermined based on the desired output power back-off level\nfor the efﬁciency peak, i.e., Wp/Wc =N, where the back-off\nlevel is 10log 10(1 +N) dB. As the parasitic capacitances are\nproportional to the widths of transistors, 2 the transformer’s\nturn ratio is derived as ntr =\n√\nN. For the case of symmetric\nDPA with a 6-dB back-off level, the transformer would have\na unity turns ratio. Using (11)–(13), L1,2 can be derived as\nL1 =km\n√\nC2/C1\n1 −k2m\nZ0\nω0\n(14)\nL2 =km\n√C1/C2\n1 −k2m\nZ0\nω0\n. (15)\nAssuming that C2 =Co and C1 =Co/N (i.e., the output par-\nasitic capacitance of the peaking transistor is denoted by Co,\nwhich is N times larger than that of the carrier transistor),\nthe total (summed) inductance is derived as\nLT ,TR =\n(√\nN + 1√\nN\n) km\n1 −k2m\nZ0\nω0\n. (16)\nThere is only one inductor in the low-pass impedance inverter\nnetwork that is given by\nLT ,LP =Z0\nω0\n. (17)\nIn order to make a fair comparison, it is assumed that in the\ncase of high-pass circuit, the output parasitic capacitances\n2Considering different biasing conditions of the peaking and carrier tran-\nsistor, the ratio of their parasitic capacitances is not exactly equal to ratio of\ntheir widths. However, this is a minor effect, especially for the drain-source\nparasitic capacitances, and will be neglected in theoretical derivations.\nVOLUME 7, 2019 119847\nG. Nikandishet al.: Bandwidth Enhancement of GaN MMIC Doherty Power Amplifiers\nof the transistors are compensated by extra parallel induc-\ntors Lp1 = N/ω2\n0Co and Lp2 = 1/ω2\n0Co, which can be\nabsorbed into the circuit inductance L =Z0/ω0. Therefore,\nthe total inductance is given by L||Lp1 +L||Lp2, which can be\nexpressed as\nLT ,HP =\n( 1\n1 +Co/C + N\nN +Co/C\n)Z0\nω0\n. (18)\nThe total inductance is dependent on the output parasitic\ncapacitance Co/C = ω0 CoZ0, and for 0 ≤ Co/C ≤ 1\nit varies within 1–2× of Z0/ω0. Here, Co/C = 0.5 is\nused in the simulations. In Fig. 6, the total inductance of the\ntransformer-based impedance inverter is depicted versus the\ntransformer’s coupling coefﬁcient. The results are shown for\na symmetric DPA with N =1. It is noted that for low coupling\ncoefﬁcients, the total inductance can be smaller than that of\nthe conventional low-pass and high-pass circuits. This leads\nto a more compact chip area, which is important in MMIC\nimplementations.\nFIGURE 6. Comparison of the total inductance of the transformer-based\nimpedance inverter [Fig. 5(b)] with conventional low-pass and high-pass\ncircuits (Fig. 4).\nGenerally, the advantages of this circuit can be summarized\nas follows.\n1) The required inductances can be smaller than in the\nconventional circuits.\n2) Thanks to the three design parameters, L1, L2, and\nkm, the required capacitances can be selected indepen-\ndently from the inductances. This allows the circuit to\nbe realized without the need for extra capacitors.\n3) The inductors can be used to provide a drain bias feed\nfor the transistors.\n4) The circuit can be used in asymmetric DPAs without\nthe need for extra elements to balance the circuit.\nC. LOAD MODULATION NETWORK FOR MMIC\nIMPLEMENTATION\nFor a MMIC implementation, the quarter-wavelength trans-\nmission lines of the broadband DPA architecture are replaced\nwith their lumped-element equivalent circuits. By replac-\ning TL 1,3 with the proposed transformer-based impedance\ninverter circuit of Fig. 5(b) and TL 2 with the high-pass circuit\nof Fig. 4, the load modulation network of the broadband DPA\nis obtained as shown in Fig. 7. The high-pass circuit is chosen\nso that the inductors L3 can be absorbed into the transformers,\nleading to an even more compact circuit implementation. The\ndrain bias voltage can be applied through the primary winding\nof the transformers.\nFIGURE 7. Transformer-based implementation of the load modulation\nnetwork in the DPA with two-section peaking network.\nWe remap this circuit further such that it constrains the\ntransformers to have only a 1:1 transformation ratio. These\ntransformers can be implemented as edge-coupled microstrip\ntransmission lines in MMIC processes, which usually feature\nwide bandwidth. As shown in Fig. 8, a transformer with a\nparallel inductor at its secondary winding can be transformed\ninto a transformer with a unity transformation ratio and a\nseries inductor at the primary. It can be shown that the ele-\nments of the two circuits can be related as\nL = L2Lpar\nL2 +Lpar\n(19)\nLser =(1 −k2)L1L2 +(L1 −L2)Lpar\nL2 +Lpar\n(20)\nk′=\n√\nL1\nL2\nk. (21)\nFIGURE 8. Circuit transformation used to simplify the transformer-based\nnetwork.\nUsing this transformation, the load modulation network\ncircuit is simpliﬁed as shown in Fig. 9, which is now more\nappropriate for a MMIC implementation. The circuit ele-\nments are calculated using (1)–(3), (11)–(13), and (19)–(21).\nThere are two degrees of freedom in this system of equa-\ntions which can be considered as the design parameters to\nmaximize the bandwidth. We choose the coupling coefﬁ-\ncients of the transformers k1,2 as such design parameters.\n119848 VOLUME 7, 2019\nG.

(23)\nThe impedance parameters of the networks N1 and N2 can be\nderived as (i =1,2)\nZ11,Ni (ω) = x −x3\nk2\ni /(1 −k2\ni )x4 −2x2 +1 −k2\ni\nj\nω0Coi\n(24)\nZ12,Ni (ω) = 1/x\nk2\ni /(1 −k2\ni )x4 −2x2 +1 −k2\ni\n−j\nω0Coi\n(25)\nZ22,Ni (ω) = k2\ni (x −x3)\nk2\ni /(1 −k2\ni )x4 −2x2 +1 −k2\ni\njω0CoiZ2\n0i, (26)\nand Z21,Ni (ω) =Z12,Ni (ω), while for the network N3\nZ11,N3 (ω) =Z22,N3 (ω) = x −x3\n1 −2x2 jZ03 (27)\nZ12,N3 (ω) =Z21,N3 (ω) = x3\n1 −2x2 jZ03, (28)\nwhere x = ω/ω0 denotes the normalized frequency. Fre-\nquency response of the normalized impedance Zc,BO/Ropt\nis dependent on the transformers coupling coefﬁcients and\nprocess-dependent parameters ω0Ropt Coi.\nIn Fig. 10, the real part of Zc,BO in the conventional and\nbroadband DPA architectures is shown for different trans-\nformer coupling coefﬁcients (k 1,2 =k). The circuit parame-\nters are assumed as ω0 =2π ×5 GHz, Co1 =Co2 =0.4 pF,\nRopt =100 , and m =1 (i.e., Z01,02,03 =Ropt =2RL ).\nIn the broadband DPA, increasing the coupling coefﬁcient k\nFIGURE 10.

Therefore,\nthe maximum bandwidth is achieved for moderate coupling\ncoefﬁcients (e.g., 0.6). In Fig. 11, fractional bandwidth of\nthe conventional and broadband DPAs is plotted versus the\nFIGURE 11.

For k = 0.7, fractional\nbandwidth of the broadband DPA is achieved as 44%.\nInsertion loss of the load modulation network degrades\nefﬁciency of the DPA, especially at back-off where the\nimpedance transformation ratio is larger. Assuming that all\ninductors have the same quality factor, Q, insertion loss of\nthe conventional and broadband load modulation networks at\nback-off and center of the frequency band versus transformer\ncoupling coefﬁcient is shown in Fig. 12. The insertion loss\nis decreased with increasing the coupling coefﬁcient. The\nbroadband load modulation network exhibits much lower\ninsertion loss for small coupling coefﬁcients (e.g., k ≤0.5),\nwhile its insertion loss is slightly higher for large coupling\ncoefﬁcients (e.g., k ≥0.7).\nFIGURE 12. Insertion loss of the conventional and broadband load\nmodulation networks at back-off versus transformer coupling coefficient,\nfor different Q of inductors.\nIt should be noted that choosing a high coupling coefﬁcient\nwould lead to large total inductance (Fig. 6). Moreover, para-\nsitic capacitive coupling between the primary and secondary\nof the transformer can degrade the bandwidth. Therefore,\na moderate coupling coefﬁcient (e.g., 0.6 ≤k ≤0.8) should\nbe chosen to achieve wide bandwidth and low insertion loss\nwhile saving the chip area.\nThe two transformers have different roles in the load mod-\nulation network. The transformer of the carrier ampliﬁer\npath transforms the load impedance into the optimum load\nimpedance of the carrier ampliﬁer at back-off, while the\ntransformer in the peaking ampliﬁer path mitigates effects\nof the parasitic capacitance of the peaking transistor on the\nDPA bandwidth. Therefore, their optimal coupling coefﬁ-\ncients can be different. In Fig. 13, contours of the fractional\nbandwidth are shown versus the coupling coefﬁcients (k 1, k2).\nThe maximum bandwidth is achieved for 0.6 ≤k1 ≤0.7 and\n0.7 ≤k2 ≤0.8. In Fig. 14, contours of the insertion loss are\nshown versus (k1,k2). The insertion loss is mainly determined\nby k1 and is almost independent of k2. This is consistent with\nthe fact that output power at back-off is delivered through the\ncarrier path’s transformer to the load resistance.\nFIGURE 13. Fractional bandwidth of the broadband DPA at back-off\nversus coupling coefficients of the transformers.\nFIGURE 14. Insertion loss of the broadband load modulation network at\nback-off versus coupling coefficients of the transformers (for inductors’ Q\nof 10 and 20).\nIn practice, the coupling coefﬁcients should be optimized\nin the layout design where effects of the parasitic capacitances\nand resistances of the transformers are considered.\nIII. CIRCUIT DESIGN\nIn this section, we present circuit design of a broadband DPA\nusing the proposed load modulation network. A symmetric\nDPA architecture with peak efﬁciency at 6-dB back-off is\ndesigned for a target frequency band of 4.5–6.0 GHz. The\nDPA circuit schematic is shown in Fig. 15.\nA. OUTPUT NETWORK\nThe width of transistors in this 0.25-µm GaN MMIC process\ncan be chosen to achieve an optimum load resistance of 100 \nin order to simplify the output network of the DPA. The gate\nwidth of 8×75 µm leads to Ropt ≈100 . The drain-source\nparasitic capacitance is estimated as 0.4 pF. The process\noffers stacked double-metal transmission lines with total\nthickness of 5 µm over a 100-µm substrate. The coupling\n119850 VOLUME 7, 2019\nG.

The DPA circuit schematic.\ncoefﬁcient of two edge-coupled microstrip transmission lines\nversus their spacing is plotted in Fig. 16. The maximum\ncoupling coefﬁcient that can be achieved in this process is\n0.7, which is limited by the 5 µm minimum spacing rule of\nmetal layers.\nFIGURE 16. Coupling coefficient of the edge-coupled microstrip\ntransmission lines versus their spacing in the GaN MMIC process.\nThe circuit of Fig. 9 is designed using the developed proce-\ndure and is optimized based on EM simulations. The coupling\ncoefﬁcient of the transformers is 0.64 (6-µm line spacing).\nThe inductance values are extracted as Ls1,s2 =0.52 nH and\nL1,2 =1.12 nH, while their quality factor is estimated as\nQs1,s2 =26 and Q1,2 =20.\nB. INPUT NETWORK\nThe input network of the broadband DPA architecture\nin Fig. 2 is composed of a power splitter and a quarter-\nwavelength transmission line providing a 90 ◦ phase shift.\nThe input impedance of the ampliﬁers should be matched\nto 50 . The power division and phase shift functions can be\nmerged by using a quadrature hybrid circuit, e.g., a branch\nline coupler or Lange coupler. We use a Lange coupler\nfor its broadband response and compatibility with MMIC.\nStandard Lange coupler includes quarter-wavelength trans-\nmission lines which in the targeted frequencies are too\nlong to ﬁt within the chip. We use a meandered structure,\nshown in Fig. 17, for a compact implementation. The physical\ndimensions w, s, d, and l1,2 are tuned based on EM simula-\ntions to achieve the desired broadband performance. In this\ndesign, l1 =1600 µm, l2 =1400 µm, d =150 µm, and\nw =s =10 µm. Simulation results indicate that the Lange\ncoupler provides 91 ◦–93◦phase shift with <0.9 dB insertion\nFIGURE 17.

Input matching networks of the transistors are\nrealized using lumped and distributed circuit elements.\nC. DPA SIMULATION RESULTS\nThe two drain bias pads of the DPA circuit in Fig. 15 are inter-\nnally connected so that the DPA would need only one supply\nvoltage, VD =28 V. The DPA is biased at VG1 =−2.5 V,\nVG2 = −4.5 V. Large-signal simulation results are shown\nin Fig. 18, where power gain and DE are plotted versus output\npower in the frequency band of 4.5–6.0 GHz. The efﬁciency\nbehaves similarly as in the ideal DPA at the center of band,\nbut it deviates at the edges of the band. At 5.5 GHz, DE is\n50.6% at peak output power of 36.5 dBm, while degrading\nto 36.5% at 6-dB power back-off. The back-off efﬁciency\nenhancement over the class-B is 1.44, which is lower than\nthat of the ideal DPA (i.e., 2). This is usual in integrated\ncircuit implementations mainly due the limited bandwidth\nof the load modulation network, higher losses of the load\nmodulation network at back-off, and nonzero current of the\npeaking transistor. The power gain is 7.5 dB at peak power\nand 9.0 dB at back-off.\nFIGURE 18. Simulated power gain and DE versus output power in the\nfrequency band 4.5–6.0 GHz.\nIV. MEASUREMENT RESULTS\nThe DPA is fabricated using the 0.25-µm GaN-on-SiC pro-\ncess from WIN Semiconductors. The chip shown in Fig. 19\noccupies 3.0 ×2.8 mm 2 area. The chip is wire-bonded to a\ntest printed circuit board (PCB). The transistors are biased at\nthe 28-V drain voltage, while their gate voltages are adjusted\nbased on the efﬁciency and linearity requirements.\nFIGURE 19. Chip micrograph (3.0 mm × 2.8 mm).\nA. CW MEASUREMENTS\nFor CW measurements, the DPA is biased at VG1 =−2.4 V,\nVG2 =−4.0 V, and VD =28 V. The gate biases are tuned such\nthat the DPA achieves the best back-off efﬁciency improve-\nment. A driver ampliﬁer is used at the input of the DPA to\nprovide the required input power level. The measurements are\nperformed up to 6 GHz due to the limited bandwidth of the\ndriver stage.\nIn Figs. 20–22, the measured and simulated gain, DE,\nand PAE are shown versus output power. The measured\nmaximum gain ranges from 7.6 dB to 11.6 dB. The peak\noutput power measured at 2–3 dB gain compression is\n35–36 dBm. DE is within the range of 42.8–48.7% at peak\npower and 24.4–31.6% at 6-dB back-off. PAE is measured\nat 31.8–40.7% at peak power and 22.5–27.6% at 6-dB back-\noff. The back-off efﬁciency enhancement over the class-B is\nwithin 1.22–1.62 (compared to 2 for an ideal DPA). In Fig. 23,\nmeasured DE and PAE are shown versus frequency at peak\npower and 6-dB back-off.\nFIGURE 20. Measured and simulated gain versus output power.\nB. MODULATED-SIGNAL MEASUREMENTS\nIn the modulated-signal measurements, a 64-QAM input sig-\nnal with 100-MHz modulation bandwidth and 8.06 dB PAPR\nis applied to the DPA. In Fig. 24, the measured error vector\n119852 VOLUME 7, 2019\nG. Nikandishet al.: Bandwidth Enhancement of GaN MMIC Doherty Power Amplifiers\nFIGURE 21.

Here,\nACLR is reported as average of the relative power leakage\ninto the lower and upper adjacent channels. The peaking\ntransistor is biased at −4.0 V. It is observed that by choosing\nan appropriate gate bias voltage for the carrier transistor,\nFIGURE 24. Measured EVM, average PAE, and ACLR versus average output\npower for different gate bias voltages of the carrier transistor. A 64-QAM\nsignal with 100-MHz modulation bandwidth and 8.06 dB PAPR at 5.0 GHz\nis used in the test.\ni.e., −2.0 V, EVM and ACLR can be improved by 4.6 dB\nand 5.7 dB, respectively. This has a negligible effect on the\naverage efﬁciency. This feature is a result of the nonlinearity\ncancellation of the peaking and carrier transistors which are\nbiased in the class-C and class-AB modes [28]. Using the gate\nbias of −2.0 V for the carrier transistor, EVM of −28.6 dB\n(3.7%), average PAE of 31.1 dBm, and −34 dBc ACLR can\nbe achieved at 31 dBm average output power.\nIn Fig. 25, the measured output constellation and spectrum\nare shown for the 64-QAM input signal. The gate biases of\nthe carrier and peaking transistors are respectively chosen as\n−2.0 V and −4.0 V. An EVM of −30.5 dB (3%) is achieved\nat 29.3 dBm average output power and 25.7% average PAE. 3\nC. PERFORMANCE COMPARISON\nIn Table 1, the performance of the designed DPA is compared\nwith broadband GaN MMIC DPAs reported in the literature.\n3It is noted that the EVM and ACLR are measured without using any\npredistortion. Further linearity improvements can be achieved by adopting\ndigital predistortion (DPD).\nVOLUME 7, 2019 119853\nG. Nikandishet al.: Bandwidth Enhancement of GaN MMIC Doherty Power Amplifiers\nTABLE 1. Comparison of broadband GaN MMIC Doherty power amplifiers.\nFIGURE 25. Measured output constellation and spectrum for a\n64-QAM signal with 100-MHz modulation bandwidth and\n8.06 dB PAPR at 5.0 GHz.\nThe bandwidth is deﬁned based on the 1 dB drop in output\npower in cases where enough measured data is available.\nOur DPA reaches a wide fractional bandwidth of 28.9%\nthanks to the developed load modulation network. A wider\nbandwidth (42%) was only reported in [14], which was real-\nized in TriQuint 0.25-µm GaN MMIC process, although it\nwas tested with a maximum modulation bandwidth of only\n20 MHz. The DPA efﬁciency is comparable with that in\nother designs. However, a low EVM of −30 dB has been\nachieved for a 64-QAM signal with wide modulation band-\nwidth of 100 MHz and PAPR of 8 dB. This can be compared\nwith −28 dB EVM at center of the bandwidth reported in [15]\nfor an 80-MHz 64-QAM signal. However, its average efﬁ-\nciency was not reported to make a comparison.\nV. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we presented a bandwidth enhancement tech-\nnique for monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC)\nDoherty power ampliﬁers (DPAs). It was shown that a\nquarter-wavelength impedance inverter can be realized using\ntwo transformer-coupled microstrip transmission lines and\noutput parasitic capacitance of transistors. The circuit was\nused to realize a broadband load modulation network for\nDPAs. This network includes two transformers that are used\nto improve frequency response of the load impedance pre-\nsented to the carrier transistor at back-off and extend the\nDPA bandwidth. A proof-of-concept DPA, designed and\nimplemented using a GaN MMIC process, achieved drain\nefﬁciency of 42.8–48.7% at peak power and 24.4–31.6% at\n6-dB back-off, over the frequency band of 4.5–6.0 GHz\n(28.9% fractional bandwidth).\nREFERENCES\n[1] R.
