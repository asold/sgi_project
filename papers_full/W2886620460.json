The short -circuits in operation \nare commonly caused by different faults such as: \nmechanical damage of insulation, electric insulation \nbreakdown (caused by voltage), over heating fault, or open \ncircuit fault [1]. \nThe short -circuit is a serious fault for the transformer. \nHigh electric currents can damage the device easily. Electric \ncurrents cause high temperature of windings therefore their \nisolation is damaged. However, high electro-magnetic forces \nare much more dangerous. Electro -magnetic forces  can \ndamage the transformer permanently. \nIt is necessary to pay attention to higher reliability of \npower transformers, due to possible failures of an  electric \nsystem and because of their cost. \nWindings of the power transformer should be designed to \navoid mechanical and thermal faults caused by short -circuit \ncurrents. Permanent deformations and gradual aging process \nof the electrical device are often ca used by short -circuit \ncurrent. Gradual aging process can worsen its mechanical \nproperties. Heat shocks often cause decrease of mechanical \nproperties of the transformer. Next it can cause unexpected \ndamage of transformer during its operation.  \nVibration bas ed fault diagnosis of transformer winding \nwas presented in the literature [2 ]. Fault diagnosis of power \ntransformers using dissolved gas analysis was presented in \nthe literature [3 ]-[7]. Electrical parameters of transformers \nwere analyzed [8]-[10]. Signal processing and classification \nmethods were also used for proper fau lt diagnosis of \ntransformers [11 ]-[14] and other types of machines [15] -\n[18]. \n \n \n \nMEASUREMENT SCIENCE REVIEW, 18, (2018), No. 4, 162-167 \n \n163 \n \nTo prevent the faulty state of transformers, the authors \nperformed different types of diagnostic measurements. The \nmeasurements should illustrate a current state of the \nmeasured power transformer. It is essential to select a proper \ndiagnostic method for the recognition of faulty state.  \nIn the analysis a new technique for analyzing the effects of \nshort-circuit curr ents is introduced. This technique  is \ndeveloped for high-voltage transformers (different types of \npower). \nThe authors  focused on short-circuit of  the transformer \nwindings. The effect of magnetic field on conductor current \ncauses the creation of forces . Mentioned forces have effect \non coils of windings.  \nThe electric currents of the transformer do not exceed \nrated values for normal operation. The electromagnetic \nforces effecting on transformer winding are low. The \ncurrents of short -circuits can reach the mul tiple of rated \nvalues of the transformer. \nThen the forces can become dangerous for transformer \ncoils of windings, electric and magnetic circuits, taps and \nthe whole construction. \nThe short -circuit forces affecting on windings can be \ndivided into two groups [19]: \n• radial (cross), \n• axial (longitude). \nRadial forces are caused by el ectromagnetic lengthwise \nfields. They act in the radial direction . Radial forces  are \ngenerated by leakage flux density and the current.  They are \nparalleled with the axis of transformer  winding. R adial \nforces extend external high -voltage windings. They also \ncompress internal low-voltage windings. For this reason, the \nair interspaces are bigger. \nAxial forces act in the axial direction.  Similar to radial \nforces, axial forces are generated by leakage flux density \nand the current. They  are dangerous from the center to \nborder of coil. In this area of transformer the magnetic field \nhas the high value in up  and down edge of winding. A xial \nforces can reach dangerous values of short -circuits forces. \nThey can also deform the outer high-voltage coil [19]. \n \n \n \nFig.1.  Simulation deformation of coil of the high-voltage \nwinding (22 kV). \n \nAccording to the literature [19] it is required to pay more \nattention to catching the outer high -voltage coil of winding. \nIn case of a loose coil, the short-circuit axial forces Fd result \nin a vertical shift of outer coils of winding. The excessive \npressure on spacers can press on the coil insulation and shift \nthe winding. It can also cause serious damage to the \ntransformer windings.  \nFig.1. shows the simulation deformation of coil of the \nhigh-voltage winding (22  kV). It is influenced by radial \nforces (permanent shift of winding). \nFig.2. shows the simulation of pressure stress and \npermanent deformation of outer coil of wi nding. It was \ncaused by short -circuit of the transformer.  Axial forces are \nalso proportional to the maximum current of the short-\ncircuit. Even with a little imbalance between the windings, \nthis force can be increased. \n \n \n \nFig.2.  Permanent deformation of outer coil of winding. It was \ninfluenced by pressure  stress from axial force ( 5 % per unit \nimbalance of the windings).  \n \nBased on theoretical and simulating analysis  it can be \nnoticed that the analysis of dangerous short -circuit forces is \nessential. It is necessary to determine the possible effects of \nshort-circuit. It can  also change the insulating state and the \nmechanical state of transformer. \n \n2.  EXPERIMENTAL DIAGNOSTIC  METHODS OF TRANSFORMERS \nThe main problem of current energy transmission and \ndistribution is that the measured data from the diagnostic \nmeasurements are not analyzed  so much . There are \nproblems to find scientific  databases of such signals. \nTherefore, it is problem to assess the technical state of \npower transformers depending on their residu al lifetime. A \nfault can occur in an unpredictable time of operation. The \nresult of this can be the power failure for a short or  a long \ntime. It is needed to analyze the measured and computed \nvalues of parameters. It is based on knowledge of exposure \nto adverse effects of specific electrical equipment.  \nAchieving objectives by using the measurements can help \nto explain the adverse effects of short -circuit and p ropose \nnew diagnostic techniques. Moreover, it is possible to detect \nan approaching fault of the e lectric device. Some steps may \nbe also proposed in advance (e.g. re pair of transformer) \n[20], [21]. \nThe authors consider the influence of overvoltage, \nswitching currents, short -circuit forces. Following \nmeasurements can be carried out for analyzed  power \ntransformers: \n \n \n \nMEASUREMENT SCIENCE REVIEW, 18, (2018), No. 4, 162-167 \n \n164 \n \n• measurements of transformer impedance depending on \nthe frequency characteristics. It can be carried out using \nthe SFRA method, \n• time measurements  of transformer coils. It can be \ncarried out using impact test - high-voltage pulse \nsource, \n• measurements of impedance, resistivity of power \ntransformer windings, \n• analysis of the transformer oil, \n• measurements of electric currents, voltages, insulation \nresistances using methods: RVM - Relevance Vector \nMachine, PDC  - Polarization and Depolarization \nCurrent, \n• measurements of loss factor and capacity, \n• measurements of isolation parameters of the power \ntransformer with application of dielectric spectroscopy, \n• measurements of temperature of the transformer \nwinding using FBG - Fiber Bragg Grating [22], \n• selected variant of measuring methods. \nDifferent measuring methods and diagnostic techniques \ncan be used for fault diagnosis of transformers  such as: \nanalysis of acoustic emission, thermal images, \nelectromagnetic radiation, analysis of temperature and \nmoisture of trans formers. The mentioned techniques can be \nused for detect ion of the effects of overvoltages and short -\ncircuits. Effects of overvoltages and short -circuits can \ndamage coils of the transformer. Repair of power \ntransformer costs time and money. Mentioned techn iques \ncan be applied for disconnected power transformer [23]. \n \n \n \n \nFig.3.  Analysed power transformer with defect  \nof the coil of phase A. \n \n3.  EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS OF THE POWER TRANSFORMER \n22 / 0.4 KV \nOn the basis of theoretical analyses of effects of s hort \ncircuit, there were selected individual diagnostic and \nmeasurement methods for measurements on a power \ntransformer 22 kV / 0.4 kV with defect on the high -voltage \nphase – coil A (Fig.3.).  \nImportant task was to compare measured curves of single \ntransformer winding  and the sensitivity of the two \ndiagnostic methods – high-frequency method SFRA (Sweep \nFrequency Response Analysis) and the method of the time \nanalysis of high voltage impulse by impact test. Frequency \nand time method (SFRA and impact test) can  determine the \nfrequency or time response of characteristic quantities of \naffected by impedance and phase of transformer.  \nThere is no need of changing of construction of the \nmeasured machine for both diagnostic techniques. They are \nalso analyzed for disconnected transformer [24]. \n \n4.\n  MEASUREMENT OF THE TRANSFORMER USING FREQUENCY \nMETHOD \nThe power transformer diagnostics set up uses the \nfrequency  scale from 20  Hz to 10  MHz at source voltage \n0.2 – 20 Vpp, and output impedance 50 Ω using the Megger \nFRAX 150, (Fig.4.). \n \n \nFig.4.  SFRA measurement connection using the Megger FRAX. \n \nMentioned analyzer can be used for magnetic core defects \nand detecting winding shifts of power transformers. The \nparameters of device are following: sampling rate 100 MS/s, \nabsolute accuracy ± 0.5  dB for dynamic range -130 to \n+20 dB. The analyses were carried out for no -load and \nshort-circuit states. \n \n \n \nFig.5.  Block diagram of measurements of power transformer. \n \nFor low frequencies (up to 1  kHz) measured curves were \ngood visible. F or frequencies (1 kHz to 100  kHz) problems \nrelated to shift of windings turn -to-turn fault occurred [25]. \n \n \n \nMEASUREMENT SCIENCE REVIEW, 18, (2018), No. 4, 162-167 \n \n165 \n \nFor higher frequencies (>100  kHz) the faults related to \nshort-circuit forces may appear. \nThe process of fault analysis on the transformer by \nmeasurement of the SFRA method with impact test is shown \nin Fig.5. Differences between measured frequency curves \nare analyzed by value of relative factor Rxy. This analysis is \nbased on calculation of normalization factor covariance \nusing equations (1), (2) and (3). \nThe short -circuit test detected winding state of the \ntransformer. It showed deformation of internal winding. It \nalso showed its shift as an activity of short-circuit. The \nimpedance depending on frequency for short-circuit and no-\nload states was presented in Fig.6. \n \n \n \nFig.6.  Impedance depending on frequency for short-circuit  \nand no-load states. \n \nImpedance depending on frequency of three windings of \nthe power transformer of no-load test is depicted in Fig.7. In \nthe Fig.7. we can see deformation of the coi l A. This \ndeformation occurr ed in the range of 1-10 kHz. Different \nvalues of B -C impedance mean  damage of coil A for star \nconnected transformer. \n \n \n \nFig.7.  Impedance depending on frequency of the power \ntransformer of no-load state. \n \nRelative factor R xy was used for analyses of differences \nbetween analyzed states. \nFor the analysis the authors used the equations (1), (2) and \n(3): Computation of the two compared standard variances is \nfollowing: \n21\n0\n1\n0\n)(1)(∑ ∑\n−\n=\n−\n=\n\n\n\n −=\nN\nK\nN\nK\nx kXNkXD    \n21\n0\n1\n0\n)(1)(1\n∑ ∑\n−\n=\n−\n=\n\n\n\n −=\nN\nK\nN\nK\nY kYNkYND    (1) \n \nwhere X(k) and Y(k) are values of curves of analysed phase \nconnection A-C and B-C, N is the number points. \nComputation of the two compared covariances: \n \n21\n0\n21\n0\n1\n0\n)(1)()(1)(1\n\n\n\n −⋅\n\n\n −= ∑∑ ∑\n−\n=\n−\n=\n−\n=\nN\nK\nN\nK\nN\nK\nXY kYNkYkXNkXNC        (2) \n \nFor computation of two analyzed  states the authors used \nNormalization factor of covariance. \n \nYX\nXY\nXY\nDD\nCR =                             (3) \n \nIn the frequency range from 1  kHz to 100  kHz, the value \nof Rxy was equal to 0.35  for no -load state . Magnitude \ndepending on frequency for winding -phase A -C and B -C \nwas depicted (Fig.8.). \n \n \n \nFig.8.  Magnitude depending on frequency  \nfor winding-phase A-C and B-C. \n \nAnalysis (Fig.8 .) showed deformation anomaly due to \nshort-circuit of the transformer. Damage to the power \ntransformer is the result of damage of the phase coil A \n(visual damage in the Fig.3.). \n \n5.\n  TIME ANALYSIS OF THE TRANSFORMER  \nTime method using  the impact test is often used for \nanalysis of the insulation between coil s. It is also used for \ndetection of the attenuated winding sections of electrical \nmachines (also transformers) . T his method allows us to \nverify early states of the coil faults. Short-time voltage \npulses are used fo r the winding in order to form  a voltage \ngradient across the coil of the winding. The coil dampens  \noscillations through transient sinus form at the time intervals \namong pulses.  Each transformer winding has unique \ncharacter of response. It can be analyzed by oscilloscope. \nWave form is influenced by transient circuit depending  on \nthe winding inductance and inside capacity of the pulse \ngenerator. A diagram for the impact test method of three-\nwinding power transformer is presented in Fig.9.  \n \n \n \nMEASUREMENT SCIENCE REVIEW, 18, (2018), No. 4, 162-167 \n \n166 \n \n \n \nFig.9.  A diagram for the impact test method of three-winding \npower transformer. \n \nVoltage of coils A and B depending on time was shown in \nFig.10. It compares time curves o f pulse test measurement \nof the transformer. \n \n \n \nFig.10.  Analysis and comparison of transformer coils  \nA and B using impact test. \n \nThe differences between voltage of two coils can be \nnoticed in the range of 0 -350 ms. Measurement was carried \nout using test of two coils. Phase of coil A is influenced by \nshort-circuit. Phase of coil B is well visibly. The decrease of \namplitude at the  interval 2  (151-350 ms) is caused  by \nchange of the resistance and capacitance . It was caused by \ndamaged insulation of coil A.  State of the transformer \nwindings can be detected if we know single curves overlap \n(with similar fault-free curve).  Mutually shifted dependents \nindicate the permanent damage of one coil. Next it analys es \ntime and amplitude differences between states. Two \nimpulses were analyzed for two  intervals. The values of \namplitude coefficien t related to respective ratio at  time \nintervals were showed in Fig.11. For pa irs of coils A -B and \nA-C at interval 0 -150 ms, the maximum val ue of ratio is \nequal to 5.47. At time interval 150-350 ms, the maximum of \nratio is equal to 8.11. The lower value of amplitude was for \npair of fault -free coils B -C. The short -circuit as well as \npermanent deformation of coil s A-C had higher value of \namplitude. \n \n \n \nFig.11.  Ratio of amplitude of analyzed coils A-C, \nB-C of the transformer. \n \n6.\n  CONCLUSIONS \nIn the paper the authors showed the importance of \nknowledge about theoretical and experimental analysis of \nthe effect of short-circuit forces. Measurements of \ntransformer were carried out in high-voltage laboratory. The \nanalyzed short-circuit forces caused non -reversible \ndeformation of the winding of the power transformer. The \nproposed analyses showed that the effects of short -circuit \ncurrent need proper diagn ostic and measuring method s. \nAnalyzed state of the transformer was dangerous for  \noperation. Coils of transformer windings were diagnosed by \nmeans of the SFRA method and time impact test. The \nanalyzed methods had a significant sensitivity for small \ndeformation of coil. The proposed methods allowed us to \nanalyze short-circuit of the coil of the transformer winding. \nThe advantage of analyzed methods is that they can also \ndetect the fault area in the transformer or its winding. \nFault diagnosis measuring methods should be developed to \nincrease the reliability of electrical equipment. The proposed \napproach can be used for other types of transformers. \nMoreover, the presented techniques have potential \napplication for fault diagnosis of electrical equipment such \nas: transformers and electrical machines. \nIn the future, the authors  will analyze the effects of other \nshort-circuit currents. The authors  will also measure \ndielectric parameters of transformers. It would be also a \ngood idea to analyze moisture of the insulating paper and \nthe conductivity of the oil transformer. \n \nA\nCKNOWLEDGMENT \nArticle was financed by the Ministry of Education of \nSlovak Republic, the Grant Agency VEGA under contract \nNo. 1/0602/17. \n \nR\nEFERENCES \n[1] Hrabovcova, V., Rafajdus, P., Franko, M., Hudák, M. \n(2009).
