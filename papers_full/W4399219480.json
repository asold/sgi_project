  "abstract": "To avoid the overfitting problem of the network model and improve the facial expression recognition effect of partially occluded facial images, an improved facial expression recognition algorithm based on MobileViT has been proposed. Firstly, in order to obtain features that are useful and richer for experiments, deep convolution operations are added to the inverted residual blocks of this network, thus improving the facial expression recognition rate. Then, in the process of dimension reduction, the activation function can significantly improve the convergence speed of the model, and then quickly reduce the loss error in the training process, as well as to preserve the effective facial expression features as much as possible and reduce the overfitting problem. Experimental results on RaFD, FER2013, and FER2013Plus show that this method has significant advantages over mainstream networks and the network achieves the highest recognition rate.",
