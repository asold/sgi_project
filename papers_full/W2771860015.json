Introduction \nAn accurate estimation of vehicle densities is considered as a significant factor for managing traffic operations in \nurban zones. Traffic information includes vehicle counting, speed measurements, determination of peak hours, number \nof pedestrians, etc. [1]. Large cities usually do not have problems acquiring such information, because they have an \nadequate infrastructure to obtain it such as surveillance cameras throughout the city, speed check points and continuous \nvehicle counting. However, in smaller cities, without such infrastructure or even an assigned budget, traffic data should \nbe attained in a manual manner or by adapting available technology. \nTypically, vehicle counting is achieved by using different techniques, such as manual counts, pneumatic tubes, \nmagnetic sensors, inductive loops, piezoelectric sensors, acoustic detectors, passive infrared, dop pler and radar \nmicrowave sensors [2, 3]. However, sensor measurements exhibit estimation errors, and sometimes, present difficulties \nto install and/or remain fixed. For optimizing vehicle counting, automatic video -based tracking systems are \n                                                        \n* Corresponding author: despejel@uach.mx \n http://dx.doi.org/10.28991/cej-030935 \n This is an open access article under the CC-BY license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). \n© Authors retain all copyrights. \n\nCivil Engineering Journal         Vol. 3, No. 11, November, 2017 \n1030 \n \nrecommended [4]. The system detects and tracks vehicles while they pass through the camera, providing information \nsuch as vehicle count, average speed, or traffic congestions [5 -7]. To achieve it, an algorithm must be created that \nsegments and tracks the vehicle movements within the video [6, 8, 9].  \nAlthough automatic vehicle counting software already exist, and some of them use the Kalman filter [7, 10-14], their \nprice is elevated, and in some cases, may be prohibitive. An alternative vehicle counting tool for low budget conditions \nis proposed, which involves video -image processing with the Kalman filter in Matlab. Users will only need a fixed \ncamera on a high point (e.g. pedestrian bridge, light pole) and a computer with a powerful processor. The video is \nprocessed automatically through a Matlab code. \n2. Background \nThe developed vehicle counting tool was tested in an express way, called Periferico de la Juventud (PDJ), considered \nthe most important traffic road of Chihuahua City, which is the capital of the state of Chihuah ua, located in northern \nMexico (Fig. 1). In 2010, the city had a population of 809,232 inhabitants, with a ratio of one vehicle for every two \ninhabitants [15], and nowadays, approximately 500,000 vehicles are registered in the city [16]. Chihuahua City is \nconsidered a metropolitan zone, and its road infrastructure occupies about the 42% of urban area, and contains a dozen \nmain roads, with traffic jam issues during peak hours [17]. PDJ is located west of Chihuahua City; its length is ca. 20 \nkm and has a N-S direction (Fig. 1). According to Chihuahua city’s planning department, PDJ was not properly designed, \nresulting in a series of bottlenecks appearing due to incorrect location of in/out ramps [17]. PDJ does not have traffic \nlights, and communicates both residential and business zones along its way.  \nCurrently, Chihuahua City faces public transportation problems [18]; the number of automobiles has augmented, \nrequiring a larger circulation space within the city [17]. Therefore, it is vital to obtain vehicle counting data to be able to \nsimulate traffic scenarios, and thus to propose answers integrating displacements of pedestrians, drivers, cyclists, and \npublic transportation users. \n \nFigure 1. Location map of the case study, where C1 and C2 are the two points of video and manual data acquisition [19]. \n3. Methodology  \n3.1. The First Test Case: Ideal Dam Break Over Movable Bed  \nCurrently, image processing is considered as a suitable tool to improve image quality or to look for information \namongst them. Analyzing images in real time involves several processes, such as the study of iconographies’ flux \ncaptured by a camera, and the system control based on the results [20]. One of the major problems to be considered, is \nworking with image sequences is degradation due to presence of noise, which appears while acquiring the images [11, \n\nCivil Engineering Journal         Vol. 3, No. 11, November, 2017 \n1031 \n \n21-23]. It is imperative then to remove the noise a nd process the images in real time [24] by applying a filter, such as \nKalman, which can separate random signals from noise [25]. \nThe Kalman filter is an algorithm designed to function as an estimator, that minimizes the estimated error [26 -28]. \nThe filter predicts random signals, separates signals from random noise or detects signals with the presence of noise. \nThe filter uses a sequence of measurements detected over time, and produces more accurate variable estimates [25]. \nNowadays, the Kalman filter is wi dely used in navigation and guidance technology [29], vehicle control (air - and \nspacecraft) [30], signal processing and econometrics [29]. Traffic engineering has embraced this method in image \nprocessing.  \nFor traffic data, the Kalman filter was first used  to predict vehicle volumes that circulated at a certain point and in \nshort term [31, 32]. Subsequently, vehicle tracking algorithms have been created using the Kalman filter to obtain \nimproved estimates of traffic densities and to facilitate the data acqu irement [4, 7, 10, 33 -35]. There are also new \nalgorithms for vehicle detection that combine the Kalman filter with other methods, such as the hybrid median filter \n[13], but require a more complex programming language. \n3.2. Data Acquisition \nThe processed images were recorded by a fixed camera positioned in two pedestrian bridges (points C1 and C2, \nFigure 1) located in the middle (C1) and in the northern part (C2) of PDJ, facing north. Along with the video images \nprocurement, manual vehicle counting was completed to validate the automated counting tool. \nThe camera used was a 9.2 megapixels video HD handycam, installed in a tripod over two different pedestrian \nbridges. The algorithm was performed in Matlab 2013b, on a laptop with 1 TB Rom, 12 GB Ram and icore 7 processor \nunder Windows 10 OS. The speed of processing images was 4 fps. \n3.3. Video Analysis for Vehicle Counting \nMatlab was the selected software to process the images for its accessibility and for containing the Kalman filter \nfunction. The Kalman filter code for Matlab already exists, but it needs modifications to focus it for vehicle counting. \nTo generate the video analysis, several adjustments were applied, which consisted in: (a) configuring the vehicle \ndetection and tracking by adding a corner box with the total count, (b) delimiting geometrically and manually the lanes \nto analyze, and (c) eliminating the noise that increases the total sum, such as shades and other objects (e.g. pedestrians, \nsidewalk edges). \nFor circumstances where cities lack surveillance videos or have budget issues, videos can be obtained placing a fixed \ncamera on a high point, such as a pedestrian bridge or any light or electricity pole. For analysis purpose and a better \nperformance in Matlab, images should be in black and white, and the videos must be converted to .AVI or .MP4 format. \n3.4. Vehicle Detection in MATLAB \nDetection and vehicle tracking within Matlab, using the Kalman filter, is a practical method to evaluate the traffic \ndensity at a given point (Figure 2).  \n \n \nFigure 2. Vehicle counting in Matlab. Camera was stationary over a pedestrian bridge (C2) at Periferico de la Juventud. \n \nTo make the code work, a flow chart (Figure 3) and the following steps should be followed: \n\nCivil Engineering Journal         Vol. 3, No. 11, November, 2017 \n1032 \n \n1) To accelerate image processing and to obtain the vehicle total count quicker, it is recommended to cut the video every \nfour images. \n2) Matlab’s “Built-in” function “ginput()” allows the user to move and click the mouse to get coordinates in 2D, in this \ncase, to delimitate the lane width that defines the counting area. \n3) The large shades or the headlights are usually counted as a vehicle and cause error. The shades’ RGB range tends to \nbe low (the closest to [0,0,0], the darker the image). Depending of the time the video was taken, the shades’ colo rs are \nmatched with the asphalt color using a cycle, skipping the code block tolerance that added vehicles to the counting. It is \nnecessary to analyze all the frame and to know its size, by assigning a size “X” to a variable “nz” to create the cycle. \n4) Once the area is delimited and the shades eliminated, the Kalman estimation is performed. The program displays a \nrectangle that identifies the vehicle movement and size, reporting it as one count. A tolerance range must be established \nfor the result. With a variable flag, the program decides if the movement detected is a vehicle and if it has been already \ncounted. Pixels in the background are not altered by the vehicle detection. \n5) A corner box can be added to be displaying the vehicle counting. \nThe variables employed in the Kalman filter algorithm are declared as the following matrixes: \nR – Noise measurement matrix  \nH - Transform from measure to state matrix \nQ - System noise matrix  \nP - The status covariance matrix  \nA - State transform matrix \nX - Current frame. \nFrom this point the Kalman algorithm is applied to reduce the possible noise present in the coordinates enclosing the \nrectangular space where the detected vehicle is located. This is basically the prediction and correction stages, inherent \nto the Kalman filter. During the prediction phase, an a priori estimate of a given state at a time k is given, and an error \ncovariance associated with the a priori estimate. In the correction phase, a measurement update needs to be calculated, \nas well as the Kalman gain, a posteriori estimation, and its error covariance associated with a posteriori estimation.  \nThe initial variable values were first, as an input the actual frame with the background already subtracted, so it could \nbe used in the correction phase and to be able obtain the updated value of the matrix Xk, as well as with the value of the \nKalman gain (the closer it is to 0, the reliability of the prediction is greater) an updated value is obtained. And each time \nthe cycle progresses, the pixels containing the input change, and therefore, the prediction variable. \n \nFigure 3. Proposed procedure of applying the Kalman filter to images \n\nCivil Engineering Journal         Vol. 3, No. 11, November, 2017 \n1033 \n \n4. Results \nThe Matlab code effectiveness was measured in distinct video recordings, at different city points. In Table 1, the \nMatlab analyses (automated) for one lane are presented along with the manual counting, to measure the efficiency of \nthe suggested code. C1 and C2 are recording videos from two different points, facing the same direction. The best \nperformance was attained w hile using time periods of 90 seconds, avoiding the program cycling. By using a more \npowerful processor, analyzed time periods can be increased. The difference in the total count is attributed to the variable \nspeed in the vehicles. The slowest detected mov ement sometimes is counted as two vehicles. Errors can also be \naccounted for extreme weather conditions (heavy rain, snow, hail) that may change the asphalt color, thus the shade \ndoes not match with it. \nTable 1.

If this is the case, the manual count \nis recommended. The presented program can be improved to add speed detection. \n5. Conclusions \nThe result of adjusting Kalman filter function within Matlab to create a vehicle counting tool, can be considered as \nan economical alternative for obtaining traffic data. The algorithm can be adapted to fit the users’ necessities and/or to \nthe camera’s position. At this stage, it is recommended to process videos with a length smaller than 90 seconds to avoid \nthe failing of the processor. Likewise, it is suggested to analyze one, or maximum three lanes at a time to optimize the \nprogram performance, which can also be valuable to obtain the traffic occupancy rate. This code is useful at peak hours, \nwhen a manual count is programmed, because only one person is needed to complete it. In this case, Matlab was the \nselected software to achieve the goals in this paper, but the Kalman filter can be used to process images in any other \nplatform of your choice. \n6.
