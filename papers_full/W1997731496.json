In terms of asset management,\ntransformer units are speciﬁcally managed at both individual\nand population levels [1]–[3].\nFor each individual unit, the condition of the unit has to be\nregularly checked and often quantiﬁed/categorized based on the\nunderstanding of physics of aging and the degradation process;\nthe concept of condition indicators, or referred to as an asset\nhealth index, is becoming widely adopted; together with the\nunit’s criticality, the asset health index can act as the main base\nfor the decision-making in termsof whether to run, repair, refur-\nbish, or replace (RRRR) that speciﬁc unit [2]–[4]. On the other\nhand, a large proportion of the transformers was installed in the\n1960s and early 1970s and are approaching or have already ex-\nceeded their designed lifetime of 40 years [5]–[8]. Their perfor-\nmance is expected to deteriorate and the consequential increase\nof aging-related failures is therefore of great concern for util-\nities. A long-term plan for the replacement of the aging trans-\nformer population before itreaches an unacceptable stateh a st o\nbe made.\nAn accurate projection of expenditure into the future—to re-\nplace a large quantity of power transformers—is required due to\nthe fact that transformers are high capital cost assets with a long\nacquisition lead time [9]–[11]. In this respect, historical average\nfailure rates would no longer be applicable for the prediction\nof failures in the wear-out/aging state [12]. Efﬁcient lifetime\nmodels have to be developed so that transformers’ failure char-\nacteristics throughout their life cycle can be modeled accurately.\nIn this paper, deﬁnitions of early-life random failures and\naging-related failures are given speciﬁcally for transformer\nfailure statistics, and the requisites toward data quality are\nsystematically studied through sensitivity analysis of censoring\nrates and failure numbers. A case study, which simulates the\ntransformer ﬂeet data of National Grid, is then given to demon-\nstrate the data quality issue. Finally, the effectiveness of the\nproposed postmortem approach, of which the sole purpose is to\nhelp distinguish random and aging-related failures, is demon-\nstrated in terms of improving the accuracy of transformer\nstatistical life modeling.\nII. T\nRANSFORMER FAILURE STATISTICS\nA. Conceptual Failure Model\nTransformer failure occurs, when the withstand strength of\na transformer, with respect to one of its key properties, is ex-\nceeded by the relevant operational stress [13].\n0885-8977 © 2013 IEEE. Personal use is permitted, but republication/redistribution requires IEEE permission.\nSee http://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/rights/index.html for more information.\nZHOU et al.: DATA REQUISITES FOR TRANSFORMER STATISTICAL LIFETIME MODELLING—PART II 155\nFig. 1. Conceptual transformer failure model.\nThe key properties refer to electromagnetic ability, integrity\nto carry current, dielectric wit hstand strength (to earth/be-\ntween phases/between windings), and mechanical withstand\nstrength (to short-circuit cur rent and resulting mechanical\nforce) [13], [14]. The operational stresses include normal and\ntransient loading conditions as well as some disturbances,\nsuch as lighting overvoltages, switching operations, or system\nshort-circuit faults [13].\nAlthough the actual origins or causes of failure may be\ndifferent from transformer to transformer, a conceptual failure\nmodel (Fig. 1) can still be adopted to illustrate the general\nmodes of transformer failures, representing their statistical\ncharacteristics [15]. In the ﬁgure, “strength” and “stress”\nare generic terms used to cover any of the aforementioned\nproperties and stresses. Failures occurred at time\n,a n d\nrepresent two types of failure modes (i.e., aging-related failure\nand random failure, respectively) and they will be separately\ndiscussed in 1) and 2).\n1) Deﬁnition of Aging-Related Failures:During the course\nof its life, a transformer will experience irreversible deleterious\nchanges to its serviceability and this is deﬁn e da st h ea g i n gp r o -\ncesses in [16]. Due to the existence of these aging processes,\nthe withstand strengths of the transformer gradually decrease\nand may deteriorate faster than normal if some abnormal or de-\nstructive deterioration process occurs [13].\nA ss h o w ni nF i g .1 ,a tt i m e\n, the strength of a transformer\ndeteriorates to such a level that it is no longer enough to cope\nwith the normal operational stress, resulting in a failure at\nthis speciﬁc moment. This type of failure is mainly caused\nby the deterioration of strength with regard to the normal\noperational stress and is hereafter categorized as aging-related\nfailure. Aging-related failures, as revealed in Fig. 1, are mostly\nconcentrated in older ages of transformers’ life cycles.\n2) Deﬁnition of Random Failures:The other types of failures\noccurring at time\n, as shown in Fig. 1, are the ones caused\nby the random stresses that accidentally exceed the strengths\nof a transformer. This type of failure is hereafter referred to as\nrandom failure.\nAlthough it may happen throughout the lifetime of a trans-\nformer, for a transformerﬂeet, random failures, however, are\nthe most prominent ones observed at younger ages.\nAs pointed out in [17], the report published by CIGRE\nSC 12 [18] is still considered as the most up-to-date interna-\ntional survey of transformer reliability. The study analyzes\nFig. 2. Proportions of transformer failures related to components [18].\nFig. 3. Proportions of assumed causes of random failures [18].\ntransformer failure data collected from 13 countries on three\ndifferent continents, covering transformers up to the age of\n20 years but unfortunately not beyond. It is revealed in the\nreport that the origins of randomfailures are mostly related\nto transformer accessories rather than the main tank itself,\nwhere tap-changer failures take up 41% of the total failures.\nThe proportions of transformer failures related to components\nare presented in Fig. 2. Various causes can contribute to the\nrandom failures of transformers as shown in Fig. 3.\nThe survey also pointed out that failures related to aging tend\nnot to be obvious at younger ages. This corresponds to Doble\nEngineering Company’s experiences, which is that, so far, most\ntransformer failures are not due to old age, but due to some limi-\ntations in the design and manufacturing process, or due to some\nlocalized damages caused during operations and maintenance\n[14].\nHowever, aging transformers are inevitable and it is expected\nthat aging-related failure will become the dominating mode of\ntransformer failures in the future, when considering the oper-\nating transformers’ age proﬁle.\nB. Mathematical Models for Transformer Failures\nMathematically, random failures are characterized by the\ninstantaneous failure rate remaining relatively constant over\ntime, corresponding to the ﬂat region of the bathtub curve,\nwhereas the aging-related fa ilures are characterized by an\nincreasing instantaneous failure rate with age, corresponding\nto the back-end phase of the bathtub curve. Both failure modes\ncan be represented by the two-parameter Weibull distribution\nfunctions since this type of distribution, with different pa-\nrameters, is ﬂexible in representing different relationships of\ninstantaneous failure rate versus age [19], [20].\nThe cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the two-pa-\nrameter Weibull distribution is given as\n(1)\n156 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER DELIVERY, VOL. 29, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2014\nwhere\nfailure time, expressed as a variable;\nscale parameter;\nshape parameter.\nThe instantaneous failure rate versus age relationship of the\nWeibull distribution is shown\n(2)\nis determined by the value of the shape parameter so\nthat:\n• represents the “random failures” where the instan-\ntaneous failure rate remains constant over time;\n• represents the “aging-related failures” where the\ninstantaneous failure rate increases with age.\nAs for the scale parameter,, it represents the age by which\n63.2% of the transformer units are expected to have failed. For\nt h ee x t r e m ec a s eo f\n1, where random failures are concerned,\nthe mean lifetime of the distribution is equal to the value of.\nIn this paper, random and aging-related failure models\nare mathematically represented by Weibull distribution func-\ntions, and the parameters are chosen as and\n, representing a utility’s current understanding\non the level of random failure rate and aging-related failure\nrate, respectively. Detailed explanations will be provided in\nSection IV. Moreover, all of the exemplar discussions on\ndata-quality issues will be based on these parameters, that\nis,\nand , and so is the combined\ntransformer failure model.\nIII. DATA REQUISITES FOR WEIBULL LIFETIME MODELS\nIn this section, data requisit es for accurately modelling\nthe random failure are analyzed when comparing the case of\naging-related failure modelling. The same modeling procedures\nfor the aging-related failures as discussed in [21] are adopted.\nIn order to make consistent comparisons between these two\nfailure modes, multiple trials of Monte-Carlo simulations are\nconducted to simulate 10 000 sets of random and aging-related\nfailures, respectively, in vari ous sampling scenarios. Each\nsampling scenario represents a combination of sample size\n(i.e., total number of lifetime data) and the censoring rate (i.e.,\nproportion of surviving units). The sample size is chosen to be\nin the range from 40 to 1000, and the censoring rate is chosen\nto be in the range from 0% to 95%. The maximum-likelihood\nmethod [22] is then adopted to estimate the parameters of the\ntwo-parameter Weibull distribution for each set of lifetime data.\nAdopted as the evaluation criteria for the estimated results,\nthe relative root mean square error (RRMSE), as deﬁn e di n( 3 ) ,\nand the relative difference between the estimated median value\nand the true value (RD), as deﬁned in (4), are both calculated\nfor estimated Weibull parameters\nBias (3)\nwhere\nFig. 4. RDs of the estimated shape parameter in various censoring rates (upper\nﬁgure) and various sample sizes (lowerﬁgure).\nBias\nvalue of the parameter;\nestimated value of the parameter\nMedian (4)\nwhere Median is the median value of the estimated parame-\nters.\nAs speciﬁed in [23], in order to evaluate the modelling ac-\ncuracy effectively, two aspects of the test results as trueness\nand precision are considered, respectively, and they can be com-\nputed as bias and standard deviation (SD). RRMSE hence serves\nthe purpose for an overall evaluation criterion as bias and stan-\ndard deviation are computed into this combined value, as shown\nin (3). RRMSE, however, bears a disadvantage, which could be\naffected by any single extreme value that can either too high or\ntoo low compared with the rest of the results. In such a case,\nRRMSE, on its own, cannot reﬂect the true accuracy level of\nthe estimated results; therefore, RD, as it is immune to extreme\nvalues, is then adopted to provide additional information on the\ncentral tendency of the results.\nThe two values, that is, RRMSE and RD, complement each\nother for an effective evaluation.It is expected that the closer the\nRRMSE and the RD are to zero, the higher the accuracy level of\nthe estimated parameters will be. Consequently, the inﬂuence of\ndifferent combinations of sample size and censoring rate on the\naccuracy of the estimated Weibull parameters can be revealed\nthrough the comparison of changes of RRMSE and RD with\nchanges in sampling size and censoring rate. As a result, these\nare the differences between the modelling random and aging-\nrelated failures under the same sampling scenario.\nThe RDs and RRMSEs of the estimated\nvalues in various\ncensoring rates and sample sizes are presented in Figs. 4 and\n5, respectively. The black lines indicate the estimated results\nin the case of random failure, and the blue lines indicate the\nestimated results in the case of aging-related failure; the same\ngraphic format is maintained for all of the followingﬁgures in\nthis section.\nAs seen in Fig. 4, RDs of the estimated\nvalues are the\nsame in the case of random failure and the case of aging-related\nZHOU et al.: DATA REQUISITES FOR TRANSFORMER STATISTICAL LIFETIME MODELLING—PART II 157\nFig. 5. RRMSEs of estimated shape parameter in various censoring rates\n(upper ﬁgure) and various sample sizes (lowerﬁgure).\nFig. 6. RDs of the estimated scale parameter in various censoring rates (upper\nﬁgure) and various sample sizes (lowerﬁgure).\nfailure as black lines overlap blue lines. The same observation\nfor RRMSEs of the estimated values can be also made as in\nFig. 5. This implies that the same level of accuracy for the esti-\nmated\nvalues can be achieved for the same sampling scenario\nirrespective of the true underlying distribution, that is, whether\nit is in the random failure mode or aging-related failure mode.\nThe RDs and RRMSEs of the estimated\nvalues in various\nsampling scenarios are presented in Figs. 6 and 7, respectively.\nRRMSEs are presented in log scale in order to differentiate\nthe values in the two cases of random failure and aging-related\nfailure.\nAs shown in Fig. 6, RDs of the estimated\nvalues in the case\no fa g i n g - r e l a t e df a i l u r ea r ec l o s e rt oz e r ow h e nc o m p a r e dt ot h e\nresults in the case of random failure. The RRMSEs of the esti-\nmated\nvalues in the case of aging-related failure are generally\nlower than the results in the case of random failure, as revealed\nin Fig. 7. These imply that the accuracy of the estimated\nvalues\nis dependent on the true underlying distribution of the lifetime\ndata; to be precise, in the same sampling scenario, a higher level\nof accuracy for the estimated\nvalues is expected for modelling\naging-related failures than random failures. This means that in\norder to reach the same level of accuracy as the aging-related\nfailure model, a larger sample size with a lower censoring rate\nis of necessity for the random failure model.\nFig. 7. RRMSEs of the estimated scale parameter in various censoring rates\n(upper ﬁgure) and various sample sizes (lowerﬁgure).\nTABLE I\nREQUIREMENT OF THEMINIMUM SAMPLE SIZE AND NUMBER OF FAILURES\nSELECTED AT THECENSORING RATE UNDER AN EXPECTED ACCURACY LEVEL\nAs discussed in [21], the value of RRMSE can be directly\ntaken as a measure of accuracy level for an estimated parameter,\nthat is, shape parameter or scale parameter, and an expected\naccuracy level of RRMSE\nis found to be appropriate\nto determine the requirement of minimum sample size for each\nspeciﬁed censoring rate.\nBy choosing\nas the expected accuracy of\nestimated and for the cases of random failure and aging-\nrelated failure, their corresponding minimum sample sizes are\nobtained as listed in Table I.\nAs shown in Table I, the accuracy of the lifetime model in the\ncase of random failure is controlled by the accuracy level of the\nestimated\nvalue, as a larger sample size is required to reach\nthe expected accuracy level of. The accuracy of the lifetime\nmodel in the case of aging-related failure, however, is controlled\nby the accuracy level of the estimated\nvalue.\nTaking the censoring rate of 90% as an example, to reach\nan accuracy level of RRMSE 0.25 for estimated or ,t h e\nrandom failure model would require a sample size of 900 or\n200, respectively, whereas the aging-related failure requires 40\nor 200 samples. Therefore, to obtain RRMSE\n0.25 for and\nparameters, a sample size of 900 with 90 failures is of necessity\nfor the random failure mode, whereas only a sample size of 200\nwith 20 failures is required for the aging-related failure.\n158 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER DELIVERY, VOL. 29, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2014\nFig. 8. Age proﬁle of a group of operating transformers in a utility company.\nThrough the comparison of these two cases, it is clear that a\nlarger sample size or a lower censoring rate is expected for ac-\ncurately modelling random failures than aging-related failures.\nIV. C\nASE STUDY TO SIMULATE AUTILITY’S TRANSFORMER\nFLEET DATA AND THEIMPORTANCE OFPOSTMORTEM ANALYSIS\nLifetime models for the cases of random and aging-related\nfailures can be used through the competing risk model [24],\nto form a database which represents the failure characteristics\nof a transformerﬂeet. In this case study, a lifetime database,\nwhose composition is similar to a utility’s transformer survival\nand failure data collected since the 1960s, is simulated.\nFirst, the random failure is represented by the Weibull distri-\nbution with the two parameters\n500 (the scale parameter)\nand 1 (the shape parameter). This reﬂects the utility’s cur-\nrent understanding on the level of random failure rate, which\nis around 0.2% per transformer per year. This is equal to a\nmean time to failure (MTTF) of\n% 500 years. Then,\nthe aging-related failure is assumed to follow the Weibull dis-\ntribution of\n100 and 5 ,w h i c ha l s or eﬂects the utility’s\ncurrent understanding on the transformer aging-related failures.\nFinally a set of 800 lifetime data, whose age proﬁle is provided\nin Fig. 8, is generated to mimic the real-life situation for the\nutility’s transformerﬂeet.\nAmong the 800 lifetime data, 44 transformers failed at var-\nious ages and the failure dataare generated. The number of\nfailed transformers at each age is presented in Fig. 9. It is known\nthrough postmortem analysis that 43 are random failures and\nonly 1 belongs to the type of aging-related failure.\nPostmortem analysis plays an important role in helping dis-\ntinguish different failure modes so that the lifetime model for\neach failure mode can be estimated separately. By separating\nthe failure modes, the scale parameter and shape parameter of\nthe two-parameter Weibull distributions for both random failure\nand aging-related failure are estimated separately using survival\nand failure data through the maximum-likelihood method. The\nestimated Weibull parameters are listed in Table II.\nAs presented in Table II, both random failure and aging-re-\nlated failure models can be successfully derived. The shape pa-\nrameter of the random failure model and aging-related model\nare estimated as 1.28\nand 7.91 1, respectively.\nFor the random failure model, the relative bias of the esti-\nmated scale parameter, 37.2%, is larger than the relative bias\nFig. 9. Age proﬁle of historically failed units in the group of transformers.\nTABLE II\nCOMPARISON OF ESTIMATED WEIBULL PARAMETERS OF BOTH RANDOM AND\nAGING-RELATED FAILURE MODES\nof the estimated shape parameter, 28%. For the aging-related\nfailure model, the relative bias of the estimated shape parameter,\n58.6%, is much higher than the relative bias of the estimated\nscale parameter of 4%. These correspond well to the simulation\nresults presented in Table I, that is, that the accuracy level of\nthe estimated\nis generally higher than the estimatedfor the\nrandom failure model; whereas the accuracy level of estimated\nis generally lower than the estimatedfor the aging-related\nfailure model.\nThe very large bias of estimatedin the aging-related failure\nmodel can be attributed to the limited number of failures. The\nextremely high censoring rate of 99.875% results with only 1\naging-related failure in 800 samples. By looking up Table I, it\nis known that 20 or more aging-related failures are expected for\nthe estimated\nvalue to reach the desired accuracy level.\nWhen postmortem analysis results are not available, which\nis common for most utilities, failure modes cannot be distin-\nguished and all of the data are used to estimate the parame-\nters of one Weibull distribution. The estimated parameters, here-\nafter referred to as conventionally estimated results, are also pre-\nsented in Table II and this means that the mode of aging-related\nfailure is concealed underthe random failures.\nV. P\nROPOSED APPROACH THAT COMBINES THE RANDOM AND\nAGING-RELATED FAILURE MODELS\nA combined lifetime model, representing the failure charac-\nteristics of a transformerﬂeet in the entire lifetime cycle, can be\nbuilt up with the competing risk model once the distributions of\nrandom and aging-related failure models are derived.\nThe competing risk model holds due to the fact that power\ntransformers are replaceable units having two main failure\nmodes, that is, random failure and aging-related failure. As\nZHOU et al.: DATA REQUISITES FOR TRANSFORMER STATISTICAL LIFETIME MODELLING—PART II 159\nFig. 10. Comparison of estimated distributions and the assumed ones.\ndeﬁned in Section II, the two failure modes are independent\nof each other. A transformer will fail whenever one of the two\nfailure modesﬁrst occurs to the transformer. The same concept\nis applied by Schijndel in formulating an integral transformer\nreliability model [25], in which a transformer is considered as\na series system consisting of separate subcomponents, and the\nsystem fails when either of the subcomponents fails.\nTherefore, the reliability, the CDF, and the instantaneous\nfailure rate of transformers (i.e., the combined lifetime model)\nare denoted as\n,a n d , respectively, and\nhold the following relationships as:\n(5)\n(6)\n(7)\nwhere\nfailure time, expressed as a\nvariable;\nand reliability, the CDF, and the\ninstantaneous failure rate for\nrandom failure, respectively;\nand reliability, the CDF, and the\ninstantaneous failure rate\nfor aging-related failure,\nrespectively.\nWith (5)–(7), the combined lifetime model can therefore be\nderived based on the random and aging-related failure models.\nThe CDF for each failure mode andits corresponding originally\nassumed distributions are presented in Fig. 10, along with the\nderived combined lifetime model.\nIt is observed from Fig. 10 that the actual transformer lifetime\nmodel, that is, the combined lifetime model, can be easily de-\nrived by combining the separate lifetime models of each failure\nmode. The accuracy of the lifetime model is greatly improved\nwith the correct identiﬁcation of the failure modes through post-\nmortem analysis.\nThe mean lifetime and the median lifetime of the combined\nlifetime model and the conventionally estimated lifetime model\nare listed together with the two values of the originally assumed\nlifetime model in Table III.\nTABLE III\nCOMPARISON OF THECOMBINED LIFETIME MODELS\nIn the present case, the median lifetime is found to be around\n88 years instead of the unreliable conventionally estimated re-\nsult of 258 as listed in Table III. The derived mean lifetime of\nthe combined lifetime model is found to be around 82 years\ninstead of the value of 321 years when the failure modes are\nunidentiﬁed. The mean lifetime of 82 years then provides asset\nmanagers some conﬁdence to say that it might be reasonable to\nallow transformers to be operated beyond the original assumed\ndesign lifetime of 40 years, although more failure data are still\nneeded for further veriﬁcation.\nVI. C\nONCLUSION\nAccurate lifetime modelling for power transformers is crucial\nfor planning the future replacement of aging transformer popu-\nlations. Since most of the transformerﬂeets have not yet com-\npleted theirﬁrst life cycle, there is a lack of transformer failure\ndata, and survival data are therefore as important as failure data\nin developing lifetime models.\nThrough a series of Monte Carlosimulations, the data requi-\nsites for lifetime modelling have been analyzed for both random\nfailure and aging-related failure models. It is shown that cen-\nsoring rate and the sample size of the collected lifetime data will\nunavoidably affect the modelling accuracy; the random failure\nmodel tends to require a larger sample size with a lower cen-\nsoring rate than the aging-related failure model.\nThe transformer life-cycle failure model can be represented\nby the combination of the random and aging-related failure\nmodels. Postmortem analysis, as the proposed approach to\ndistinguish the two failure modes, helps improve the accuracy\nof transformer statistical life modelling; the case study which\nmimics a utility’s transformer lifetime data indicates that\nthrough distinguishing the failure modes, the lifetime model-\nling gives the mean lifetime of 82 years which provides asset\nmanagers some conﬁdence to allow transformers to be operated\nbeyond the original assumed design lifetime of 40 years.\nR\nEFERENCES\n[1] E.
