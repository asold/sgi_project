In order to handle\nthis problem, we propose a hierarchical inter-\nactive Transformer (Hi-Transformer) for efﬁ-\ncient and effective long document modeling.\nHi-Transformer models documents in a hierar-\nchical way, i.e., ﬁrst learns sentence represen-\ntations and then learns document representa-\ntions. It can effectively reduce the complexity\nand meanwhile capture global document con-\ntext in the modeling of each sentence. More\nspeciﬁcally, we ﬁrst use a sentence Trans-\nformer to learn the representations of each\nsentence. Then we use a document Trans-\nformer to model the global document context\nfrom these sentence representations. Next, we\nuse another sentence Transformer to enhance\nsentence modeling using the global document\ncontext. Finally, we use hierarchical pooling\nmethod to obtain document embedding. Exten-\nsive experiments on three benchmark datasets\nvalidate the efﬁciency and effectiveness of Hi-\nTransformer in long document modeling.\n1 Introduction\nTransformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) is an effective\narchitecture for text modeling, and has been an es-\nsential component in many state-of-the-art NLP\nmodels like BERT (Devlin et al., 2019; Radford\net al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2021). The\nstandard Transformer needs to compute a dense\nself-attention matrix based on the interactions be-\ntween each pair of tokens in text, where the compu-\ntational complexity is proportional to the square of\ntext length (Vaswani et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2020b).\nThus, it is difﬁcult for Transformer to model long\ndocuments efﬁciently (Child et al., 2019).\nThere are several methods to accelerate Trans-\nformer for long document modeling (Wu et al.,\n2019; Kitaev et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020; Qiu\net al., 2020). One direction is using Transformer\nin a hierarchical manner to reduce sequence length,\ne.g., ﬁrst learn sentence representations and then\nlearn document representations from sentence rep-\nresentations (Zhang et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2020).\nHowever, the modeling of sentences is agnostic to\nthe global document context, which may be subop-\ntimal because the local context within sentence is\nusually insufﬁcient. Another direction is using a\nsparse self-attention matrix instead of a dense one.\nFor example, Beltagy et al. (2020) proposed to\ncombine local self-attention with a dilated sliding\nwindow and sparse global attention. Zaheer et al.\n(2020) proposed to incorporate a random sparse\nattention mechanism to model the interactions be-\ntween a random set of tokens. However, these\nmethods cannot fully model the global context of\ndocument (Tay et al., 2020).\nIn this paper, we propose a hierarchical interac-\ntive Transformer (Hi-Transformer)1 for efﬁcient\nand effective long document modeling, which mod-\nels documents in a hierarchical way to effectively\nreduce the complexity and at the same time can\ncapture the global document context for sentence\nmodeling. In Hi-Transformer, we ﬁrst use a sen-\ntence Transformer to learn the representation of\neach sentence within a document. Next, we use a\ndocument Transformer to model the global docu-\nment context from these sentence representations.\nThen, we use another sentence Transformer to fur-\nther improve the modeling of each sentence with\nthe help of the global document context. Finally,\nwe use hierarchical pooling method to obtain the\ndocument representation. Extensive experiments\nare conducted on three benchmark datasets. The\nresults show that Hi-Transformer is both efﬁcient\nand effective in long document modeling.\n1https://github.com/wuch15/HiTransformer.\n849\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\nHi-Transformer\nShop   the …  without [CLS] The  royals   …     is   [CLS] Prince Philip   …      )   [CLS]\nSentence 1 Sentence 2 Sentence M\nDocument\n𝒆𝒆1,1 𝒆𝒆1,2 𝒆𝒆1,𝐾𝐾 𝒆𝒆𝑠𝑠\n𝒉𝒉1,1 𝒉𝒉1,2 𝒉𝒉1,𝐾𝐾 𝒉𝒉1\n𝑠𝑠\n…\n…\n…\n𝒆𝒆2,1 𝒆𝒆2,2 𝒆𝒆2,𝐾𝐾 𝒆𝒆𝑠𝑠\n𝒉𝒉2,1 𝒉𝒉2,2 𝒉𝒉2,𝐾𝐾 𝒉𝒉2\n𝑠𝑠\n…\n…\n…\n𝒆𝒆𝑀𝑀,1 𝒆𝒆𝑀𝑀,2 𝒆𝒆𝑀𝑀,𝐾𝐾 𝒆𝒆𝑠𝑠\n𝒉𝒉𝑀𝑀,1 𝒉𝒉𝑀𝑀,2 𝒉𝒉𝑀𝑀,𝐾𝐾 𝒉𝒉𝑀𝑀\n𝑠𝑠\nWord & Position Embedding\n Word & Position Embedding\n Word & Position Embedding\n+\n𝒑𝒑1\n+\n𝒑𝒑2\n+\n𝒑𝒑𝑀𝑀\n𝒓𝒓1\n𝑠𝑠 𝒓𝒓2\n𝑠𝑠 𝒓𝒓𝑀𝑀\n𝑠𝑠\n𝒅𝒅1,1 𝒅𝒅1,2 𝒅𝒅1,𝐾𝐾 𝒅𝒅1\n𝑠𝑠 𝒅𝒅2,1 𝒅𝒅2,2 𝒅𝒅2,𝐾𝐾 𝒅𝒅2\n𝑠𝑠 𝒅𝒅𝑀𝑀,1 𝒅𝒅𝑀𝑀,2 𝒅𝒅𝑀𝑀,𝐾𝐾 𝒅𝒅𝑀𝑀\n𝑠𝑠\nPooling\n Pooling\n Pooling\n…𝒔𝒔1 𝒔𝒔2 𝒔𝒔𝑀𝑀\nPooling\nN×\nPosition\nEmbedding\nDocument Context-\naware Sentence\nRepresentations\n𝒅𝒅 Document \nEmbedding\nGlobal Context-aware \nSentence Embedding\nDocument Transformer\nSentence Transformer\nSentence Transformer\nSentence Transformer\nSentence Transformer\nSentence Transformer\nSentence Transformer\nFigure 1: The architecture of Hi-Transformer.\n2 Hi-Transformer\nIn this section, we introduce our hierarchical in-\nteractive Transformer (Hi-Transformer) approach\nfor efﬁcient and effective long document model-\ning. Its framework is shown in Fig. 1. It uses a\nhierarchical architecture that ﬁrst models the con-\ntexts within a sentence, next models the document\ncontexts by capturing the interactions between sen-\ntences, then employs the global document contexts\nto enhance sentence modeling, and ﬁnally uses hi-\nerarchical pooling techniques to obtain document\nembeddings. In this way, the input sequence length\nof each Transformer is much shorter than directly\ntaking the word sequence in document as input, and\nthe global contexts can be fully modeled. The de-\ntails of Hi-Transformer are introduced as follows.\n2.1 Model Architecture\nHi-Transformer mainly contains three modules, i.e.,\nsentence context modeling, document context mod-\neling and global document context-enhanced sen-\ntence modeling. The sentence-level context is ﬁrst\nmodeled by a sentence Transformer. Assume a doc-\nument contains M sentences, and the words in the\ni-th sentence are denoted as [wi,1, wi,2, ..., wi,K]\n(K is the sentence length). We insert a “[CLS]” to-\nken (denoted as ws) after the end of each sentence.\nThis token is used to convey the contextual informa-\ntion within this sentence. The sequence of words in\neach sentence is ﬁrst converted into a word embed-\nding sequence via a word and position embedding\nlayer. Denote the word embedding sequence for the\ni-th sentence as [ei,1, ei,2, ...,ei,K, es]. Since sen-\ntence length is usually short, we apply a sentence\nTransformer to each sentence to fully model the in-\nteractions between the words within this sentence.\nIt takes the word embedding sequence as the input,\nand outputs the contextual representations of words,\nwhich are denoted as [hi,1, hi,2, ...,hi,K, hs\ni ]. Spe-\ncially, the representation hs\ni of the “[CLS]” token\nis regarded as the sentence representation.\nNext, the document-level context is modeled by\na document Transformer from the representations\nof the sentences within this document. Denote the\n850\nembedding sequence of sentences in this document\nas [hs\n1, hs\n2, ...,hs\nM ]. We add a sentence position\nembedding (denoted as pi for the i-th sentence)\nto the sentence representations to capture sentence\norders. We then apply a document Transformer to\nthese sentence representations to capture the global\ncontext of document, and further learn document\ncontext-aware sentence representations, which are\ndenoted as [rs\n1, rs\n2, ...,rs\nM ].\nThen, we use the document context-aware sen-\ntence representations to further improve the sen-\ntence context modeling by propagating the global\ndocument context to each sentence. Motivated\nby (Guo et al., 2019), we apply another sentence\nTransformer to the hidden word representations\nand the document-aware sentence representation\nfor each sentence. It outputs a document context-\naware word representation sequence for each sen-\ntence, which is denoted as [di,1, di,2, ...,di,K, ds\ni ].\nIn this way, the contextual representations of words\ncan beneﬁt from both local sentence context and\nglobal document context.\nBy stacking multiple layers of Hi-Transformer,\nthe contexts within a document can be fully mod-\neled. Finally, we use hierarchical pooling (Wu\net al., 2020a) techniques to obtain the document em-\nbedding. We ﬁrst aggregate the document context-\naware word representations in each sentence into a\nglobal context-aware sentence embedding si, and\nthen aggregate the global context-aware embed-\ndings of sentence within a document into a uniﬁed\ndocument embedding d, which is further used for\ndownstream tasks.\n2.2 Efﬁciency Analysis\nIn this section, we provide some discussions on the\ncomputational complexity of Hi-Transformer. In\nsentence context modeling and document context\npropagation, the total computational complexity is\nO(M ·K2 ·d), where M is sentence number with a\ndocument, K is sentence length, andd is the hidden\ndimension. In document context modeling, the\ncomputational complexity is O(M2 ·d). Thus, the\ntotal computational cost is O(M ·K2 ·d+M2 ·d).2\nCompared with the standard Transformer whose\ncomputational complexity is O(M2 ·K2 ·d), Hi-\nTransformer is much more efﬁcient.\n2Note that Hi-Transformer can be combined with other\nexisting techniques of efﬁcient Transformer to further improve\nthe efﬁciency for long document modeling.\n3 Experiments\n3.1 Datasets and Experimental Settings\nOur experiments are conducted on three bench-\nmark document modeling datasets. The ﬁrst one\nis Amazon Electronics (He and McAuley, 2016)\n(denoted as Amazon), which is for product review\nrating prediction.3 The second one is IMDB (Diao\net al., 2014), a widely used dataset for movie re-\nview rating prediction.4 The third one is the MIND\ndataset (Wu et al., 2020c), which is a large-scale\ndataset for news intelligence.5 We use the content\nbased news topic classiﬁcation task on this dataset.\nThe detailed dataset statistics are shown in Table 1.\nIn our experiments, we use the 300-dimensional\npre-trained Glove (Pennington et al., 2014) embed-\ndings for initializing word embeddings. We use\ntwo Hi-Transformers layers in our approach and\ntwo Transformer layers in other baseline methods.6\nWe use attentive pooling (Yang et al., 2016) to\nimplement the hierarchical pooling module. The\nhidden dimension is set to 256, i.e., 8 self-attention\nheads in total and the output dimension of each\nhead is 32. Due to the limitation of GPU memory,\nthe input sequence lengths of vanilla Transformer\nand its variants for long documents are 512 and\n2048, respectively. The dropout (Srivastava et al.,\n2014) ratio is 0.2. The optimizer is Adam (Bengio\nand LeCun, 2015), and the learning rate is 1e-4.\nThe maximum training epoch is 3. The models\nare implemented using the Keras library with Ten-\nsorﬂow backend. The GPU we used is GeForce\nGTX 1080 Ti with a memory of 11 GB. We use\naccuracy and macro-F scores as the performance\nmetrics. We repeat each experiment 5 times and\nreport both average results and standard deviations.\n3.2 Performance Evaluation\nWe compare Hi-Transformer with several base-\nlines, including: (1) Transformer (Vaswani et al.,\n2017), the vanilla Transformer architecture; (2)\nLongformer (Beltagy et al., 2020), a variant of\nTransformer with local and global attention for\nlong documents; (3) BigBird (Zaheer et al., 2020),\nextending Longformer with random attention; (4)\nHI-BERT (Zhang et al., 2019), using Transformers\n3https://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/\n4https://github.com/nihalb/JMARS\n5https://msnews.github.io/\n6We also tried more Transformer layers for baseline meth-\nods but do not observe signiﬁcant performance improvement\nin our experiments.\n851\nDataset #Train #Val #Test Avg. #word Avg. #sent #Class\nAmazon 40.0k 5.0k 5.0k 133.38 6.17 5\nIMDB 108.5k 13.6k 13.6k 385.70 15.29 10\nMIND 128.8k 16.1k 16.1k 505.46 25.14 18\nTable 1: Statistics of datasets.\nMethods Amazon IMDB MIND\nAccuracy Macro-F Accuracy Macro-F Accuracy Macro-F\nTransformer 65.23 ±0.38 42.23 ±0.37 51.98 ±0.48 42.76 ±0.49 80.96 ±0.22 59.97 ±0.24\nLongformer 65.35 ±0.44 42.45 ±0.41 52.33 ±0.40 43.51 ±0.42 81.42 ±0.25 62.68 ±0.26\nBigBird 66.05 ±0.48 42.89 ±0.46 52.87 ±0.51 43.79 ±0.50 81.81 ±0.29 63.44 ±0.31\nHI-BERT 66.56 ±0.32 42.65 ±0.34 52.96 ±0.46 43.84 ±0.46 81.89 ±0.23 63.63 ±0.20\nHi-Transformer 67.24 ±0.35 43.69 ±0.32 53.78 ±0.49 44.54 ±0.47 82.51 ±0.25 64.22 ±0.22\nTable 2: The results of different methods on different datasets.\nMethod Complexity\nTransformer O(M2 ·K2 ·d)\nLongformer O(T ·M ·K ·d)\nBigBird O(T ·M ·K ·d)\nHI-BERT O(M ·K2 ·d + M2 ·d)\nHi-Transformer O(M ·K2 ·d + M2 ·d)\nTable 3: Complexity of different methods.

The results of\nthese methods on the three datasets are shown in Ta-\nble 2. We ﬁnd that Transformers designed for long\ndocuments like Hi-Transformer and BigBird out-\nperform the vanilla Transformer. This is because\nvanilla Transformer cannot handle long sequence\ndue to the restriction of computation resources, and\ntruncating the input sequence leads to the loss of\nmuch useful contextual information. In addition,\nHi-Transformer and HI-BERT outperform Long-\nformer and BigBird. This is because the sparse\nattention mechanism used in Longformer and Big-\nBird cannot fully model the global contexts within\na document. Besides, Hi-Transformer achieves the\nbest performance, and the t-test results show the\nimprovements over baselines are signiﬁcant. This\nis because Hi-Transformer can incorporate global\ndocument contexts to enhance sentence modeling.\nWe also compare the computational complexity\nof these methods in Table 3. The complexity of\nHi-Transformer is much less than the vanilla Trans-\nformer and is comparable with other Transformer\nvariants designed for long documents. These re-\nsults indicate the efﬁciency and effectiveness of\nHi-Transformer.\n3.3 Model Effectiveness\nNest, we verify the effectiveness of the global doc-\nument contexts for enhancing sentence modeling\nin Hi-Transformer. We compare Hi-Transformer\nand its variants without global document contexts\nin Fig. 2. We ﬁnd the performance consistently\ndeclines when the global document contexts are\nnot encoded into sentence representations. This is\nbecause the local contexts within a single sentence\nmay be insufﬁcient for accurate sentence model-\ning, and global contexts in the entire document\ncan provide rich complementary information for\nsentence understanding. Thus, propagating the doc-\nument contexts to enhance sentence modeling can\nimprove long document modeling.\n3.4 Inﬂuence of Text Length\nThen, we study the inﬂuence of text length on the\nmodel performance and computational cost. Since\nthe documents in the MIND dataset are longest,\nwe conduct experiments on MIND to compare the\nmodel performance as well as the training time\nper layer of Transformer and Hi-Transformer un-\nder different input text length7, and the results are\nshown in Fig. 3. We ﬁnd the performance of both\nmethods improves when longer text sequences are\nused. This is intuitive because more information\ncan be incorporated when longer text is input to\nthe model for document modeling. However, the\ncomputational cost of Transformer grows very fast,\n7The maximum length of Transformer is 512 due to GPU\nmemory limitation.\n852\nAccuracy Macro-F65.0\n65.5\n66.0\n66.5\n67.0\n67.5\n68.0Accuracy\n66.61\n67.24\n41.0\n41.5\n42.0\n42.5\n43.0\n43.5\n44.0\nMacro-F\n42.70\n43.69\nHi-Transformer\n- Global document context\n(a) Amazon.\nAccuracy Macro-F51.5\n52.0\n52.5\n53.0\n53.5\n54.0\n54.5Accuracy\n53.13\n53.78\n42.0\n42.5\n43.0\n43.5\n44.0\n44.5\n45.0\nMacro-F\n43.92\n44.54\nHi-Transformer\n- Global document context\n(b) IMDB.\nAccuracy Macro-F80.0\n80.5\n81.0\n81.5\n82.0\n82.5\n83.0Accuracy\n81.92\n82.51\n62.0\n62.5\n63.0\n63.5\n64.0\n64.5\n65.0\nMacro-F\n63.56\n64.22\nHi-Transformer\n- Global document context\n(c) MIND.\nFigure 2: Effectiveness of global document context\npropagation in Hi-Transformer .\nwhich limits its maximal input text length.
