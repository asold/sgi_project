INTRODUCTION\nAs the heart of a substation, a power transformer functions\nas the signiﬁcant link for voltage conversion and energy\ndelivery. Survey results show that most power transformers\nworldwide were installed in the 1980s, and many of them\nare reaching the end of their life [1]. The failure rate of\nthese transformers has been persistently increasing in recent\nyears, particularly in utilities with poor maintenance and asset\nmanagement regimes. One of the key factors that induce\ntransformer failure is winding deformation. The typical types\nof winding deformation are tilting, forced bulking, free buck-\nling, forced buckling, hoop tension, and telescoping. These\nwinding deformations are typically due to large electro-\nmagnetic forces induced by the short circuit currents [2].\nNormally, the initial stage of winding deformation is char-\nacterized by winding minor deformation. Winding minor\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Boxue Du.\ndeformation will have limited impact on the normal opera-\ntion of a power transformer, and it is difﬁcult to detect and\ndiagnose these faults. However, the minor deformation can\ndevelop into catastrophic failure if no steps are taken. Thus,\nit is of signiﬁcance to detect winding deformation faults when\nthey are at the early stage.\nSeveral winding deformation fault detection methods\nhave been successively proposed in recent years. To date,\nmajor detection methods consist of vibration method [3],\nultra-wideband (UWB) antenna method [4], short circuit\nimpedance (SCI) method [5], [6], low voltage impulse\n(LVI) method [7] and frequency response analysis (FRA)\nmethod [8]. Of all these methods, FRA is now widely\naccepted as the most superior method for winding move-\nment related fault detection in transformers. According to\nthe nature of the FRA input signal, FRA can be divided into\nsweep FRA (SFRA) and impulse FRA (IFRA) [9]. In both\nFRA methods, the frequency response signatures of the trans-\nformer are obtained by injecting the excitation signal to the\nVOLUME 7, 2019\n2169-3536 \n 2019 IEEE.

Zhaoet al.: Diagnosing Transformer Winding Deformation Faults\nwinding and measuring the response signal. The difference is\nthat the SFRA uses a sinusoidal sweep signal for excitation,\nwhile IFRA uses an impulse signal for excitation.\nAmong the above methods, FRA is a reliable, simple,\nfast, economic and non-destructive diagnostic tool [10].\nIFRA has reached potential for online application; however,\nit is currently at the rapid developmental phase [9], [11].\nSFRA is discussed the most in the literature, and is frequently\nreferred to FRA. FRA has been under development for years.\nChinese power industry standard [12] and IEC standard [13]\nhave been successively proposed to standardize the tech-\nnique. This method is widely accepted by power equipment\nowners, operators, producers and testing companies. How-\never, there still exist some problems when FRA is applied in\nthe ﬁeld.\n• The FRA signatures of a power transformer measured\nby an FRA analyzer normally include the amplitude–\nfrequency and phase–frequency characteristic signature.\nOnly the variation of amplitude–frequency signature\nis analyzed in the existing diagnostic method, and the\ninformation of phase–frequency signature is mostly\nneglected [14].\n• The FRA interpretation relies on graphical comparison,\nnamely, analyzing the variation between the FRA signa-\ntures and the reference. The current comparison process\ncalls for experienced personnel, as there is no standard\nand automatic interpretation code to date. When the\nFRA amplitude–frequency signature is used for diag-\nnosing a winding minor deformation fault, the variation\nof signature is not remarkable, and as a result, it is\nhard to detect using visual inspection, which makes the\ndiagnostic result obtained by conventional FRA tech-\nnique inaccurate. Although the detection sensitivity can\nbe improved by extending FRA frequency ranges [15],\nthe FRA frequency band beyond 1 MHz is easily\naffected by the external factors, for instance the FRA\nequipment wiring, parasitic impedance, noise, etc [16].\nThus, improving FRA sensitivity by extending the upper\nlimit of frequency is not an optimum method.\nTo solve above problems, researchers have recently\nintroduced some novel and improved methods.\nM. H. Samimi et al. have proposed improved numeri-\ncal indices for the FRA interpretation by including phase\nresponse, in which a new diagnostic index, complex dis-\ntance, was introduced in addition to a method to include\nthe phase information [17]. It was demonstrated that using\nthe phase data increases the sensitivity of the indices versus\nmechanical displacements. O. Aljohani et al.have introduced\na novel FRA interpretation approach to detect transformer\nwinding short-circuit fault, radial deformation and bushing\nfaults by using polar plot and digital image processing, in\nwhich the various image unique features of a polar plot are\nextracted using geometric dimensions, invariant moments\nand texture analysis to construct diagnostic metrics [18]–[20].\nIt was found that the polar plot exhibits more features than\nthe magnitude of the FRA signature, and the investigated\nmetrics are consistently increasing with the increase in fault\nlevel. The above outcomes are signiﬁcant contributions for\nimproving the performance of FRA diagnostics. However,\nin complex distance index, the FRA phase information is\nincluded in a speciﬁc equation, not intuitively presented in a\nwaveform or image. Nevertheless, the practical validation of a\nsmall dry–type transformer is performed in the latter ﬁnding,\nbut most FRA data of winding faults are acquired by a\n3-D ﬁnite-element analysis (FEA) of transformers, and are\nnot veriﬁed in a large oil-immersed power transformer.\nIn view of the above background, this study investigates a\nwinding deformation diagnostic method based on the analy-\nsis of binary image obtained from the FRA signature. The\nFRA amplitude–frequency and phase–frequency signatures\nare used to construct plane polar plots. The digital image\nprocessing technique is used to process polar plots to out-\ncome binary images, which can be analyzed to diagnose and\nidentify the winding deformation faults. In this study, all\nFRA raw data are obtained from actual transformer mea-\nsurements, including a specially manufactured transformer\nthat can emulate variable winding faults and two large oil-\nimmersed power transformers.\nII. THEORETICAL ANALYSIS\nA. BASIC PRINCIPLE\nThe FRA signature is obtained by a sweep frequency\napproach. The sinusoidal sweep frequency excitation voltage\nwith an amplitude of <20 V is applied to one terminal of\ntransformer winding and the response voltage at the other\nterminal is measured. The excitation signal and response\nsignal under the same frequency point are used to plot an\namplitude–frequency and a phase–frequency characteristic\nsignature, as shown in Equation (1)-(2) [10], [16],\nHf =20 log10\n|U2 (f )|\n|U1 (f )| (1)\nϕf =ϕ(U2 (f )) −ϕ(U1 (f )) (2)\nwhere U1(f ) and U2(f ) are the excitation voltage and\nresponse voltage of tested winding; Hf is the amplitude–\nfrequency characteristic signature; ϕ() is the angle of signal;\nϕf is the phase–frequency characteristic signature; and f rep-\nresents different frequency.\nPlane polar plot consists of polar radius coordinate and\npolar angle coordinate, represented by (ρ , θ). The method\nof constructing polar a plot of frequency response is that the\npolar radius and polar angle are equivalent to the amplitude\nand phase of frequency response, respectively. Thus, the ver-\ntical projection of the polar plot along X axis and Y axis under\nfrequency f can be deﬁned as Equation (3)-(4),\nxf =|Hf|·cos(ϕf) (3)\nyf =|Hf|·sin(ϕf) (4)\nwhere xf is the vertical projection of the polar plot along\nX axis under speciﬁc frequency f ; yf is the vertical projection\nof the polar plot along Y axis under speciﬁc frequency f .\n40464 VOLUME 7, 2019\nZ. Zhaoet al.: Diagnosing Transformer Winding Deformation Faults\nFIGURE 1. FRA amplitude-frequency characteristic and phase-frequency\ncharacteristic signature of a transformer winding.\nIt can be demonstrated that Equation (3) and (4) are ﬁt\nfor various values of ϕf, namely, ϕf lies in four different\nquadrants.\nAs the information of amplitude and phase of fre-\nquency response are included in the plane polar plot [18],\nthe sensitivity of using polar plot to diagnose winding fault\nmay be higher than the current traditional FRA method,\nwhich only considers the amplitude–frequency characteristic\nsignature [17]–[18].\nThe typical amplitude–frequency characteristic and phase–\nfrequency characteristic signature of a power transformer is\nshown in Fig. 1. There exist multiple resonances and anti-\nresonances between 1 and 1000 kHz. According to Chinese\npower industry standard [12], the frequency band of FRA\ncould be divided into low frequency band (1 ∼100 kHz),\nmiddle frequency band (100 ∼600 kHz) and high frequency\nband (600 ∼ 1000 kHz) for interpretation. The FRA low\nfrequency band is characterized by the transformer inductive\ncomponents because ﬂux penetration to the core is signiﬁcant\nwithin this frequency range, the FRA high frequency band is\ndominated by the transformer distributed capacitive compo-\nnents, while the FRA middle frequency band is characterized\nby inductive, as well as capacitive, components [9], [12], [16].\nAccording to above standard, the polar plot that corresponds\nto this FRA signature is presented in Fig. 2. The upper two\nsub-ﬁgures are the polar plot of an entire frequency band\nand the polar plot of 1 to 100 kHz, and the lower two sub-\nﬁgures are the polar plot of 100 to 600 kHz and the polar plot\nof high frequency band 600 to 1000 kHz.\nB. DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURE OF WINDING\nDEFORMATION FAULT\nThe proposed procedure of diagnosing transformer winding\ndeformation fault is shown in Fig. 3. The procedure also\nrelies on graphical comparison of winding healthy and faulty\ntransformer binary images.\nStep 1:The FRA data of power transformer under healthy\nand faulty status are accurately measured by an FRA analyzer,\nincluding amplitude–frequency and phase–frequency signa-\ntures. The frequency range is selected as 1 ∼1000 kHz, and\nFIGURE 2. Polar plot of variable frequency bands which corresponds to\ntransformer frequency response signature.\nFIGURE 3. Flow chart for diagnosis of proposed method.\nfrequency interval is no less than 2 kHz [12]. A linear ﬁtting\nmoving average method can be adopted to preprocess the\nFRA raw data, and the large burrs are smoothed to decrease\nthe effect of external disturbance [21].\nStep 2:The frequency response data of healthy and faulty\ntransformer are imported to MATLAB software.\nStep 3:The polar plots that correspond to 1 ∼100 kHz,\n100 ∼600 kHz and 600 ∼1000 kHz frequency ranges are\nplotted, respectively.\nStep 4:Image extraction. The polar plots can be transferred\ninto plane Cartesian coordinate system. The background of\nthe MATLAB ﬁgure is set as white color, and the coordi-\nnate axes are removed. The three primary colors (red, green,\nblue, RGB) pattern diagram of frequency response polar plot\nis then obtained. Considering that there may be signiﬁcant\ndifferences between images of healthy and faulty winding\nunder the individual sub-frequency range, it is meaningful to\ncompare two images under the same image scale. The image\nscale factor k is deﬁned. The extents of RGB image under the\nVOLUME 7, 2019 40465\nZ.

The test demonstrates\nthat the performance is good when image scale factor k is\nbetween 8 and 15, and the value of k is selected as 10 in this\nstudy.\nStep 5:Image gray and binary transformation is performed.\nThe RGB image obtained by step 4 is ﬁrst processed by gray\ntransformation, and the gray image of frequency response is\nobtained. The gray image is then transformed into a binary\nimage. The data matrix which corresponds to the binary\nimage consists of ‘‘1’’ and ‘‘0’’, ‘‘1’’ represents background\npixels of the image, while ‘‘0’’ represents the corresponding\npixels of the frequency response. Fig. 4 shows the binary\nimage obtained from polar plot of Fig. 2, the frequency band\nis 100 ∼600 kHz, the dash line of Fig. 4 is the border of the\nscaled image.\nStep 6: Fault diagnosis. Fault diagnosis is realized by\ncomparison of the binary image with its referenced image.\nTo quantify and standardize the diagnosis process, the binary\nimages of different frequency ranges are further analyzed\nby introducing a correlation indicator (ci). Speciﬁcally,\nthe matrix similarity is used to process the data matrix of\nbinary images, and the formula is given as,\nci =\n∑\nm\n∑\nn\n(\nAmn −¯A\n)(\nBmn −¯B\n)\n√(∑\nm\n∑\nn\n(\nAmn −¯A\n)2\n)(∑\nm\n∑\nn\n(\nBmn −¯B\n)2\n) (6)\nwhere ci represents the matrix similarity; m and n are the row\nand column of the matrix; Amn and Bmn are the elements of the\nmatrix A and B, respectively; ¯A and ¯B are the average values\nof all elements of matrix A and B, respectively.\nThe distribution of ci of healthy and faulty binary images\nunder individual frequency ranges can then be analyzed to\ndiagnose winding deformation fault.\nIn the current conventional FRA technique, variable sta-\ntistical indicators are proposed to interpret FRA signatures,\nfor instance, the correlation coefﬁcient, standard deviation,\nvariance, standard error of mean, root mean square, et.al [22].\nFIGURE 4. Binary image obtained from polar plot of Fig. 2 in middle\nfrequency band.\nFIGURE 5. Difference between the distributions of data corresponding to\nci and Rxy indicators.\nOf all these indices, the Chinese standard DL/T 911 suggests\nrelative factor (R xy) as the diagnostic indicator [12].\nFor the two FRA amplitude–frequency traces Xi and Yi,\nthe Rxy is deﬁned as follows [23],\nRxy =\n{\n10 1 −Pxy <10−10\n−log10(1 −Pxy) otherwise (7)\nwhere Pxy is given by,\nPxy =\n1\nN\nN∑\ni=1\n(Xi −1\nN\nN∑\ni=1\nXi) ·(Yi −1\nN\nN∑\ni=1\nYi)\n√DxDy\n(8)\nand Dx and Dy are deﬁned as,\nDx = 1\nN\nN∑\ni=1\n(Xi −1\nN\nN∑\ni=1\nXi)2 (9)\nDy = 1\nN\nN∑\ni=1\n(Yi −1\nN\nN∑\ni=1\nYi)2 (10)\nci is an indicator that computes the 2-D ‘‘0-1’’ data matrix\nof binary image, while Rxy is an indicator that computes the\n1-D vector data of FRA amplitude–frequency signature. The\ndifference between the distributions of data corresponding\nto two indicators is visually presented in Fig. 5. In Fig. 5,\n‘‘x’’ is the data of binary image with values of 0 and 1,\nwhich represent the frequency response and background,\nrespectively. ‘‘O’’ represents the amplitude data of the\n40466 VOLUME 7, 2019\nZ.

Obviously, 2-D ‘‘0-1’’ data matrix comprises\nthe amplitude as well as phase information of frequency\nresponse.\nIn addition, it can be concluded from Fig. 5 and Eq. (6)\nthat the proposed binary image method analyzes the FRA\ndata and background from a mathematical point of view. The\ncalculation of proposed binary image method is easy and fast,\nwhich may be suitable for ﬁeld application.\nIII. TEST PLATFORM OF EMULATING POWER\nTRANSFORMER WINDING DEFORMATION FAULT AND\nFRA SIGNATURES OF TYPICAL WINDING FAULTS\nIt is possible to precisely analyze the behavior of trans-\nformer windings by emulating the winding faults in actual\ntransformers. A test platform was built to perform groups\nof winding deformation fault experiments in [21] and [24].\nThe tested transformer is a specially manufactured core-type\nmodel transformer with a voltage ratio of 10/0.4 kV . Some\nnameplate parameters can be found in Tab. 1. The internal\nconﬁguration of the model transformer is designed as that\nof a 110 kV power transformer, as shown in Fig. 6. The\nHV winding is a disk type winding with a total of 30 disks,\nwhere the upper and lower 10 disks are interleaved twist and\nthe middle 10 disks are sequential twist. The LV winding\nis designed as a layer type with 6 layers. Variable windings\nwere also manufactured, which can be used to replace the\nmiddle 10 disks winding to emulate diverse winding radial\ndeformation faults.\nTypical winding radial deformation (RD) fault, inter-disk\nshort circuit (SC) fault and disk space variation (DSV) fault\nwere simulated, respectively.\nFIGURE 6. Tested model transformer with its tank uncovered.\nFIGURE 7. Images of actual RD winding. (a) 10% RD fault degree with\nfault happened in one direction. (b) 5% RD fault degree with fault\nhappened in 3 directions.\nIn winding RD fault, the middle twisted windings are\nreplaced by other manufactured deformed windings, includ-\ning different fault degrees and fault directions. Fig. 7 shows\nsome images of actual RD winding, where the size and posi-\ntion of radial deformed part is variable to emulate different\nfault degree and direction. More detailed information about\nwinding RD fault setup can be found in [21]. Winding inter-\ndisk SC fault is simulated by simply shortening the con-\nnectors of the middle sequential twist windings; the greater\nthe number of connectors that are shortened, the closer the\nseverity of inter-disk SC fault. Shortening winding disks for\nemulating the inter-disk SC fault changes the turns of winding\nand the distribution of leakage magnetic ﬁeld. Thus, the\nself-inductance and mutual-inductance are changed, which\ncontributes to the variation of winding FRA signature.\nReference [25] indicates that winding DSV fault is nor-\nmally characterized by the reduction of disk space distance,\nthe inter-disk capacitance and mutual inductance of winding\nequivalent electrical model increase. Thus, for simulating this\ntype of fault, a capacitor is connected to the connectors of two\ncontinuous disks. The connected capacitor mainly increases\nthe inter-disk capacitance. There also exists a new path for\nthe current that ﬂows through the winding, and the distribu-\ntion of leakage magnetic ﬁeld is changed. Thus, indirectly,\nthe mutual inductance parameter of the winding equivalent\nelectrical model is changed. The inter-disk capacitance of\nhealthy sequential twist windings is calculated as approx-\nimately 2 nF based on the ﬁnite element method (FEM),\nVOLUME 7, 2019 40467\nZ. Zhaoet al.: Diagnosing Transformer Winding Deformation Faults\nFIGURE 8. FEM model for calculating inter-disk capacitance of healthy\nwindings.\nFIGURE 9. Some cases of FRA amplitude-frequency signatures under\nsimulated winding inter-disk SC fault.\nFIGURE 10. Some cases of FRA amplitude-frequency signatures under\nsimulated winding DSV fault.\nthe FEM model is shown in Fig. 8. Otherwise, the degree\nof DSV fault is emulated by increasing and decreasing the\ncapacitance value, and the fault location is emulated by\nchanging the sequence numbers of the two connectors.\nEnd-to-end open circuit measurements were performed in\nthe HV winding of phase A with various fault statuses of\nthe model transformer, and a sample database was obtained.\nVarious FRA signatures of simulated winding deformation\nare shown in Figs. 9-11.\nFig. 9 shows some cases of FRA amplitude–frequency\nsignatures under simulated inter-disk SC fault, in which\n‘‘1-2 connectors’’ means that the ﬁrst and second connectors\nFIGURE 11. Some cases of FRA amplitude-frequency signatures under\nsimulated winding RD fault.\nof the middle sequential twist windings are short circuited,\nseen from top to bottom. Fig. 9 shows that FRA signatures of\ninter-disk SC fault are entirely different throughout the entire\nfrequency band compared to a healthy signature. Moreover,\nthe FRA signatures of the ‘‘1-2 connectors’’ and ‘‘5-6 connec-\ntors’’ are similar because these two fault cases are artiﬁcially\nmanufactured in the symmetrical position of the HV winding.\nFig. 10 shows some cases of FRA amplitude–frequency\nsignatures under simulated DSV faults. The fault simulated\ncapacitor is paralleled with the third and fourth connectors\nof the middle sequential twist disks of HV phase A winding.\n10% indicates the percentage of the paralleled capacitance\n(200 pF) to the capacitance of the adjacent healthy disk (2 nF),\nwith similar meanings for 20% ∼40%. In Fig. 10, the faulty\nsignature changes notably in the middle and high frequency\nbands, compared to the healthy FRA signature. The variations\nin the faulty signature become more noticeable as the fault\nlevel increases. Furthermore, the faulty FRA signature shifts\ntoward the low frequency band. The changing trend of above\nFRA signatures is consistent with the trend described in [25],\nwhich also demonstrates the feasibility of emulating\nDSV fault.\nFig. 11 shows some cases of FRA amplitude–frequency\nsignatures under simulated RD faults, in which the middle\n10 disks healthy windings of HV phase A are replaced by\nRD fault windings with degrees of 5%, 7% and 10%, all in\none direction. Fig. 11 illustrates that the faulty FRA signature\nchanges in the middle and high frequency bands, and the\ndifference is particularly remarkable beyond 700 kHz; both\nthe frequency and gain of resonant points shift for a certain\nextent. The changing trend of above FRA signatures is con-\nsistent with the trend described in [12], [26], and [27], which\nalso demonstrates the feasibility of emulating RD fault.\nIV. ANALYSIS OF WINDING TYPICAL FAULT\nEXPERIMENTS\nA. TYPICAL CASE\nThe polar binary images obtained from FRA signature of\nwinding RD fault (5%) is shown in Fig. 12, this ﬁgure also\npresents the binary images corresponding to the FRA signa-\nture of a healthy winding. In Fig. 12(a) and (b), the binary\n40468 VOLUME 7, 2019\nZ. Zhaoet al.: Diagnosing Transformer Winding Deformation Faults\nFIGURE 12.

The reason is that there is a\nsmall quantity (100 groups) of frequency response data points\nwithin the low frequency range, and the number of resonant\npoints is limited. In contrast, in Fig. 12(c) ∼(f), the binary\nimages are relatively intensive, and there exist more inﬂection\npoints on the trace of the image. Correspondingly, more\nfrequency response data points (600 and 500 groups) and\nnumbers of resonant points within middle and high frequency\nbands contribute to this particular phenomenon. Additionally,\nin Fig. 12, binary images of healthy and faulty windings in\nlow and middle frequency bands are very similar, while the\ndifference between two binary images in high frequency band\nis signiﬁcant.\nThe Rxy of healthy and faulty FRA amplitude–frequency\nsignature, which corresponds to Fig. 12, has been evaluated\nwithin various frequency bands, which is shown in Tab. 2.\nAlthough the Rxy of high frequency band is much less than\nthose of the middle and low frequency bands, according to the\nChinese standard [12], the status of winding is still diagnosed\nas healthy. The diagnostic result is not consistent with the\nactual experimental setup of winding RD fault. This case indi-\ncates that there might be false positives and false negatives in\nthe diagnostic result when traditional FRA method is used to\ndetect winding faults.\nThe ci of two binary images, which correspond to the\nhealthy and faulty winding of Fig. 12, has also been evaluated\nwithin three frequency bands, as also presented in Tab. 2.\nClearly, the ci of two binary images in high frequency band is\nTABLE 2. Relative factor of frequency response and correlation indicator\nof binary image corresponding to figure 12.\nFIGURE 13. Distribution of correlation indicators of healthy and faulty\nfrequency response binary images in all experimental setup.\nconsiderably less than those of the middle and low frequency\nbands, which indicates there could exist some abnormalities\nin the tested winding. However, the threshold value that is\nrequired for evaluating the winding status needs to be con-\ncluded from extensive tests, yet it can still be derived that\nthe variance of ci in high frequency band to ci of middle\nand low frequency band is closed to one order of magnitude.\nApparently, the proposed method is more sensitive to the\nwinding fault than the traditional FRA method.\nB. ANALYSIS OF EXPERIMENTAL RESULT\nFor the simulated winding fault experiments performed in\nsection III. A total of 42 groups of experiments were con-\nducted. The groups of inter-disk SC faults is 15, including\nvariable fault extent and fault locations setup. The combina-\ntion of simulated RD status is extensive; however, to match\nthe numbers of inter-disk SC fault, the groups of RD fault\nis set as 13, and the groups of DSV fault is 14, including\nvariable fault extent and fault locations setup as well. In each\nfault experimental setup, the FRA amplitude–frequency as\nwell as phase–frequency signatures are measured, the binary\nimage is plotted based on the proposed procedure, and the ci\nof healthy and faulty binary images under low, middle and\nhigh frequency band are obtained, respectively.\nThe ci of sub-frequency binary images obtained from all\nthe above experimental FRA signatures are plotted in Fig. 13,\nin which X axis varies from 1 to 100 kHz, Y axis varies from\n100 to 600 kHz, and Z axis varies from 600 to 1000 kHz.\nIt can be concluded that the distribution of ci corresponding\nto each type of fault is not consistent in 3-dimensional spaces,\nwhich is due to a certain span in simulating winding fault.\nVOLUME 7, 2019 40469\nZ. Zhaoet al.: Diagnosing Transformer Winding Deformation Faults\nTABLE 3. Effect of various faults on correlation indicator corresponding\nto figure 13.\nIn other words, there exists a certain interval between fault\nextents. In addition, the distribution of ci, which corresponds\nto each winding fault, is gathered. For instance, all ci of inter-\ndisk SC fault in sub-frequency bands are relatively small. The\nci of DSV fault is larger (>0.2) in low frequency band, while\nit is smaller (<0.2) in the middle and high frequency band.\nFor ci of winding RD fault, it is larger (>0.2) in the low\nand middle frequency band, while it is smaller in the high\nfrequency band. The changing trends of FRA signatures cor-\nresponding to three types of faults are totally diverse in each\nsub-frequency band; thus, there exist signiﬁcant differences\nbetween the distributions of ci of binary images. The effect\nof various faults on correlation indicator corresponding to\nFig. 13 is presented in Tab. 3, which shows obvious difference\nbetween three types of fault. This characteristic can be used\nto distinguish and recognize the types of winding inter-disk\nSC, DSV and RD faults by analyzing the distribution of ci in\nindividual frequency range.\nAdvanced machine learning technique such as support\nvector machine (SVM) can be used to differentiate three fault\ntypes. SVM is suitable for processing the classiﬁcation prob-\nlem of small-scale samples. In this study, the performance of\nSVM has been initially tested. 42 groups of experimental data\nare divided into two categories, the training set and testing set.\nThe training set is randomly selected, including 10 groups of\ninter-disk SC fault, 10 groups of DSV fault and 10 groups\nof RD fault. The rest of data consist of testing set, including\n5 groups of inter-disk SC fault, 4 groups of DSV fault and\n3 groups of RD fault. The basic element of training and testing\nset is the ci of binary images in three sub-frequency bands.\nThus, the training set is a matrix of 30 ×3 and the testing set\nis a matrix of 12 ×3, a row of the matrix is expressed in (11),\nwhich is the input of SVM algorithm.\n[ciLow ciMid ciHigh\n]\n(11)\nThe most frequently used radial basis function (RBF) has\nbeen chosen as the kernel function [28]. The parameter g of\nRBF and the penalty coefﬁcient C are optimized by the grid\nsearching and cross validation algorithm. Due to the test data\nis not massive, we construct 5 groups of different training\nand testing sets by randomly selecting from the data [24].\nThus, the optimal parameter g and C are different from each\nother in each speciﬁcally selected training and testing set.\nFig. 14 shows the parameter optimization of g and C for a\ngroup of typical training and testing set, in which the opti-\nmal g and C are 0.125 and 4, respectively. The classiﬁcation\naccuracies for 5 groups of testing sets are 100%, 91.7%,\nFIGURE 14. Parameter optimization of g and C for a group of typical\ntraining and testing set.\nTABLE 4. Classification result of winding deformation fault types\ncorresponding to one group of testing test (91.7%).\n91.7%, 100% and 100%. The classiﬁcation result of winding\ndeformation fault types corresponding to one group of testing\nset (91.7%) is shown in Tab. 4. The averaged classiﬁcation\naccuracy of 5 groups is 96.7%, which initially demonstrates\nthe SVM is capable of differentiating three fault types.\nMoreover, a criterion for judging whether fault exists or not\ncan be roughly derived from the above sample data. As the\nfault degree is smaller, the coincidence of two binary images\nin a certain sub-frequency band is higher, and the value\nof ci in this certain sub-frequency band is then larger. Thus,\na threshold value of judging criterion can be derived from the\nboundaries of Fig. 13 in three axes, in which the ci around\nthe boundaries corresponds to the winding minor deforma-\ntion fault. If the ci of binary images in low frequency band\nci <0.45, the ci in middle frequency band ci <0.4 or the ci\nin high frequency band ci <0.2, it can be preliminary deter-\nmined that there exists a certain fault in the tested winding.\nV.

The difference between two FRA sig-\nnatures is signiﬁcant, which indicates that there may be\nwinding deformation fault in one phase winding. The relative\nfactor Rxy of two FRA amplitude–frequency signatures in\nlow, middle and high frequency band are calculated and listed\nin Tab. 5. According to the Chinese standard [12], the tested\nwinding was diagnosed as a minor deformation.\nMoreover, the FRA data are converted into binary images\nbased on the proposed procedure, as shown in Fig. 16. It can\nbe seen that the difference between two binary images of\nthe middle frequency band is signiﬁcant. The correlation\nindicators ci of two binary images in the low, middle and high\nfrequency band are calculated and listed in Tab. 5. According\nto the criterion proposed in section IV , the tested winding\nwas also diagnosed as deformed, which indicates that the\ndiagnostic result obtained by the proposed method is similar\nto that obtained by the traditional FRA method when the\ndifference of two FRA signatures is signiﬁcant.\nB. ANALYSIS OF A 220 kV OIL-IMMERSED POWER\nTRANSFORMER\nA 220 kV oil-immersed power transformer was out of service.\nFRA amplitude–frequency and phase–frequency signatures\nof phase a winding were measured in 10 kV sides, as shown\nin Fig. 17 (marked in after fault). Fig. 17 also presents the\nreference FRA signature of the tested phase winding (marked\nin before fault). It is found that the difference between two\nFRA signatures is not signiﬁcant.

However, according to the Chinese standard, this\ntested winding was diagnosed as healthy.\nMoreover, the above FRA data are converted into binary\nimages, as shown in Fig. 18. The correlation indicators of two\nbinary images in the low, middle and high frequency band are\ncalculated and presented in Tab. 6, respectively. According to\nthe criterion proposed in section IV , the tested winding was\ndiagnosed as deformed. The transformer was disassembled\nafterwards, and it was found that there exist some minor\ndeformed parts on the exterior of tested phase a winding.\nThe above analysis implies that the winding minor deforma-\ntion fault sometimes cannot be detected by the traditional\nFRA method, while the proposed method shows a higher\nsensitivity to the winding minor fault.\nVOLUME 7, 2019 40471\nZ.

DISCUSSION\nThis study successfully applied the digital image processing\ntechnique to analyze transformer winding deformation faults\nvia several winding fault emulating experiments.\n1) Although a criterion for judging whether faults\nexist or not has been proposed, given the limitations of current\nexperimental conditions, the experimental sample data set is\nnot massive. More experimental data and ﬁeld cases are still\nneeded to obtain a precise and accurate judging criterion.\nNevertheless, the effectiveness of the method is demonstrated\nsuccessfully. In addition, although the FRA data of two oil-\nimmersed power transformers have been analyzed and eval-\nuated, further research is still needed to include more data\nrelated to large power transformers to verify the reliability,\nrepeatability and robustness of the binary image method.\n2) There exist clear boundaries between the distributions of\ncorrelation indicator of binary images corresponding to three\ncommon fault types, and SVM has been successively demon-\nstrated to differentiate these winding fault types. However,\nthe winding deformation fault emulating experiments are\nconﬁned to the inter-disk SC, DSV and RD fault, the actual\nwinding deformation fault is not limited to these 3 categories.\nThe distribution of correlation indicator corresponding to\nother winding fault types such as axial deformation may\nbe overlapped with the distribution area that corresponds\nto the above 3 categories. Nevertheless, the classifying and\nclustering characteristic of Fig. 13 can still be used to identify\nthese main fault types.\n3) The fault types and extent of winding deformation\ncannot be totally distinguished by the binary image method,\nbut information of FRA amplitude–frequency and phase–\nfrequency characteristic signatures are simultaneously uti-\nlized to improve the diagnostics of faults. Compared with the\ntraditional FRA method, the binary image method is more\nsensitive to the winding fault.\n4) In addition, Yousof et al.[29] discussed the possibility\nof FRA to detect transformer insulation aging, and found that\nthe insulation aging will induce small variation of FRA curve\nin most frequency range, which is caused by the variation\nof winding capacitive component and dielectric permittivity.\nAt present, frequency domain dielectric spectroscopy (FDS)\nmeasurement is the main technique to detect transformer\ninsulation aging. The main frequency range of FDS is 1 mHz\nto 1 kHz, which is different from that of FRA (1 kHz to\n1 MHz). Due to FRA is more sensitive to the transformer\nwinding deformation in frequency range of 1 kHz to 1 MHz,\nthe shift of FRA curve caused by insulation aging is signiﬁ-\ncantly minor. Thus, it is possible to distinguish the winding\ndeformation and insulation aging failure by simply analyzing\nthe variation pattern of FRA curve. Nevertheless, the effect of\ninsulation aging on the performance of the proposed method\nand the new threshold value can still be further studied in the\nnext step.\nVII. CONCLUSIONS\nThe FRA amplitude–frequency and phase–frequency infor-\nmation are combined and utilized in transformer winding\ndeformation fault diagnostic method based on the frequency\nresponse binary image.\nIn the winding fault emulating experiments conducted on a\nspecially designed and manufactured lego style transformer,\nthe variations of FRA signatures of winding inter-disk SC,\nDSV and RD fault are shown to exhibit certain regularities.\nThe distribution of correlation indicators of binary images\nin sub-frequency bands corresponding to 3 types of winding\nfaults present classifying and clustering characteristics in\na 3-dimensional space, which can be used to distinguish sev-\neral common winding fault types. Advanced machine learn-\ning technique SVM has been successfully applied to classify\nthese fault types.\nThe analyses of two actual large oil-immersed power trans-\nformer test cases demonstrate that the binary image method\ncan be used to diagnose winding deformation faults in actual\npower transformers. Although the extents and locations of\nwinding deformation fault cannot be totally determined at the\npresent stage, this method can still be used to identify the\nfault types, similar to the traditional FRA method. Moreover,\nthe higher sensitivity of the method can contribute to the accu-\nrate diagnosis of some minor winding deformation faults.\n40472 VOLUME 7, 2019\nZ.
