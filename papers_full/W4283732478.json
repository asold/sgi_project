    "abstract": "This paper explores a methodology for bias quantification in transformer-based deep neural network language models for Chinese, English, and French. When queried with health-related mythbusters on COVID-19, we observe a bias that is not of a semantic/encyclopaedical knowledge nature, but rather a syntactic one, as predicted by theoretical insights of structural complexity. Our results highlight the need for the creation of health-communication corpora as training sets for deep learning.",
