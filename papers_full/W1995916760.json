INTRODUCTION\nThe Quantum Hall Eﬀect (QHE), a novel phenomenon of 2d electron gas in a strong\ntransversal magnetic ﬁeld, has been shown to have intriguing relat ionship with string/M-\ntheory. In the early days, the realization of the quantum Hall syst ems in terms of solitonic\nsystems in string/M theory (M-branes or D-branes plus strings et c.) is the major focus [1, 2,\n3]. Recently this issue has attracted new interests in the context o f AdS/CFT correspondence\ndue to the progress in understanding of the 1/2 BPS sector on bot h string theory and gauge\ntheory sides.\nIn a remarkable work [4], Lin, Lunin and Maldacena (LLM) found a gen eral class of static,\nnon-singular solutions of IIB supergravity; these solutions prese rve at least 16 supercharges\ntogether with a SO(4) × SO(4) × R global symmetry, where R is the time translation\nsymmetry. The maximally supersymmetric solution AdS5 × S5 is a special case of the\nLLM solutions. For an observer at inﬁnity, the solutions have total energy equal to angular\nmomentum, which is just the 1/2 BPS condition in N = 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills\ntheory (SYM) in 4 dimensions. Therefore, the LLM geometries as se mi-classical gravitational\nexcitations in Type IIB string theory on AdS5 × S5 background correspond to the 1/2 BPS\nsector in the dual CFT, i.e. the N = 4 SYM in 4d.\nLLM’s interest in ﬁnding the gravitational dual of the 1/2 BPS secto r in N = 4 SYM\nwas inspired by [5, 6]. In [6], Berenstein made the following observation : certain limiting\nprocedure produces a decoupled 1/2 BPS sector in AdS/CFT corre spondence and the self\nconsistency of this decoupling procedure roots in the fact that all other degrees of freedom\ncost too much energy and can be integrated out. Accordingly, the study of the 1/2 BPS\nsector as LLM conducted provides a new testing\nground for AdS/CFT correspondence, which is more controllable on both sides than the\nentire theories. Also it was noted in [6] that the 1/2 BPS sector in N = 4 SYM can\nbe mapped to a system of 1d free fermions, which in turn can be mapp ed to quantum\nHall droplets with ﬁlling factor ν = 1 in 2d phase space. (This observation was further\nsubstantiated in refs. [8, 9, 10, 11].)\nLLM geometries provide us with an ideal setting for studying the AdS /QH/SYM con-\nnection on the string theory side. This is because the LLM solutions a re completely deter-\nmined by the boundary value of a single function z of three non-compact spatial coordinates\n2\n(x1,x2,y) with y≥ 0. When the boundary value of z on the two dimensional plane at y= 0\nis taken to be ±1/2, the corresponding geometries are non-singular. This boundary value\ncan be interpreted as the distributions for two types of point char ge sources on the two\ndimensional boundary plane. R-R ﬁve-ﬂux quantization infers that the areas of connected\nregions for z = ±1/2 on the boundary plane to be quantized in appropriate unit. Theref ore,\none may view the either regions with z = 1 /2 or z = −1/2 on y= 0 plane as droplets of an\nincompressible ﬂuid, like the quantum Hall ﬂuid. The special case AdS5 × S5 corresponds a\nuniform distribution of point sources in a circular disk with z = −1/2 on the y= 0 plane so\nit corresponds to a circular quantum Hall droplet on the plane. In th is way, it is convenient\nto describe the AdS5 × S5 geometry and its small deformations (the so-called bubbling AdS\ngeometries) in terms of quantum Hall droplets [4, 7].\nSince Integer Quantum Hall Eﬀect (IQHE) ( ν = 1 for ﬁlling fraction) emerges naturally\nin the LLM geometries, one can’t help but wonder whether this is mere ly an accidental\nanalogy or this signals any profound physics? More precisely, one ma y wonder whether the\nknowledge of QHE in condensed matter physics can provide any insigh ts into the dynamics\nof the LLM geometries. In this paper, we make progress in this direc tion by examining\nwhether Fractional Quantum Hall Eﬀect (FQHE) can make its way into the dynamics of\nthe LLM geometries. In condensed matter physics, it is well-known t hat the quasi-particles\nor quasi-holes in the ν = 1 quantum Hall system can condense to form new quantum Hall\nliquid states as an eﬀect of interactions. For example, the simplest c ase of ν = 2 /3 FQH\nstate can be viewed as the condensation of the quasi-holes in the ν = 1 IQH ﬂuid.\nAs we just mentioned, AdS5 × S5 background is treated as a circular QH droplet in the\nLLM/IQH analogy. Adding a giant graviton in S5 which is a D3-brane wrapping on a 3-\nsphere in S5 [12] corresponds to a quasi-hole excitation [4] while adding a giant gra viton in\nAdS5 [13, 14] corresponds to a quasi-particle excitation. For simplicity an d deﬁnitude, we\nwill only examine the dynamics of quasi-hole type of giant gravitons, a nd treat these giant\ngravitons as probes to the AdS5 × S5 background (as a special LLM geometry). Recall that\nthe ﬁve-form ﬂux of AdS5 × S5 background plays the role of the constant magnetic ﬁeld on\nthe y= 0 plane. We will show that the low-energy eﬀective action for the gia nt gravitons of\nquasi-hole type, when truncated by 1/2 BPS condition, exhibits all o f the essential features\nof a QH system. In other words, the giant gravitons in the 1/2 BPS s ector behave just like\nthe charged particles in a strong magnetic ﬁeld.\n3\nFor one single giant graviton, the dynamics of the Landau problem fo r a single quasi-\nhole is exactly reproduces. This result is just a self-consistent che ck that the AdS5 × S5\nbackground\nbehaves as an unexcited ν = 1 QH droplet. For many giant gravitons, if their number\nis much smaller than the background ﬂux, we can ignore their back-r eaction. Then the\nnon-abelian low-energy dynamics (world-volume theory) of the gian t graviton probes leads\nto a Chern-Simons matrix model; this matrix model is exactly the matr ix description of\nthe ﬂuid dynamics of a system of non-relativistic charged particles m oving in a constant\nmagnetic ﬁeld, i.e. the inﬁnite-matrix model in ref. [3] for the bulk QH state, or the ﬁnite-\nmatrix model in ref. [18] that incorporates edge excitations. Her e the matrix description\nfor the QH ﬂuid is remarkably suitable for our purpose in the context of giant graviton\ndynamics: The expectation values of the diagonal elements are the positions of giant gravi-\ntons in the transverse space, while the oﬀ-diagonal elements desc ribe open strings stretching\nbetween diﬀerent giant gravitons, giving rise to the interaction bet ween giant gravitons (as\nquasi-holes). Ignoring the oﬀ-diagonal elements and following the a rguments in ref. [6], we\nwill show that this matrix model in the eigenvalue basis reduces to a fr ee fermion system,\nprovided all of the eigenvalues are non-degenerate. It implies that the world-volume gauge\nsymmetry of M giant gravitons is broken from U(M) down to U(1)M , and each giant gravi-\nton ﬁlls a state with diﬀerent angular momentum j. Including oﬀ-diagonal elements will\nlead to repulsive interactions between giant gravitons, in favor of forming new incom press-\nible ﬂuids with fractional ﬁlling factors (FQH ﬂuid). This is consistent w ith the fact that the\nlevel of the resulting Chern-Simons matrix model takes only integer values, whose inverses\ncorrespond to the fractional ﬁlling factors. In this manner, we ar e able to demonstrate that\nthe 1/2 BPS dynamics of the giant gravitons wrapping on the three- sphere in S5, which\nbehave like quasi-holes in an IQH droplet with ν = 1, allows the formation of a ground\nstate corresponding to a FQH liquid due to quasi-hole condensation. Moreover, when the\nnumber M of the giant gravitons is ﬁnite but large, the resulting ﬁnite-matrix m odel allows\ngapless edge excitations, in a manner similar to that pointed out by Po lychronakos [18]. Some\nof the novel properties of the new states can be understood by r eferring to the knowledge\nof the FQH ﬂuid in condensed matter physics. We speculate that, up on including back-\nreactions of the giant gravitons, the FQH state would accordingly g ive rise to new geometries\nwith singularities in IIB string theory, and that the novel propertie s associated with the FQH\n4\nstate may help us understand how quantum eﬀects resolve the sing ularities.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section II we brieﬂy review the L LM’s 1/2 BPS\nsolutions in IIB supergravity, in particular the AdS5 × S5 geometry from LLM solutions.\nWe also review giant gravitons in AdS5 × S5. Part of the purpose of this review is to set\nup the notations. In Section III we derive the eﬀective theory whic h describes low energy\ndynamics in a special LLM geometry, the AdS5 × S5 background, of giant gravitons moving\nin S5. We shall show how this model reproduces the Landau problem for a single giant\ngraviton. Then in Section IV, it is shown how to pass from the eﬀectiv e ﬁeld theory for\ngiant gravitons to a Chern-Simon ﬁnite-matrix model, which turns ou t to be essentially the\nsame model proposed in ref. [18]. In Section V we shall demonstrate that the resulting\nmatrix model for giant gravitons accommodates all essential feat ures of FQHE, including\nthe repulsive interaction\nthat favors the formation of the FQH state. And we speculate tha t novel properties of\nthe FQH state may help us understand how quantum eﬀects resolve the singularities in the\nnew geometry that emerges when back-reactions are included. Fin ally, Section VI is devoted\nto a brief summary.\nII. 1/2 BPS GEOMETRIES IN IIB THEORY AND GIANT GRA VITON PROBES\nThe class of 1/2 BPS states is known to play an important role in testin g AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence. On the CFT side these states are associated to chiral primary operators\nwith conformal weight ∆ = J, where J is a certain U(1) charge in R-symmetry group.\nFor small excitation energy J ≪ N (N being the rank of the gauge group), these BPS\nstates on the AdS side correspond to graviton modes propagating in the bulk. When the\nexcitation energy increases to J ∼ N, some of these states are described by giant gravitons,\ni.e. spherical D3-branes either in the internal sphere[12] or in AdS [13, 14]. As excitation\nenergy increases further the back-reaction cannot be ignored, and new geometries which\npreserve 16 supercharges are expected to emerge in IIB superg ravity.\n5\nA. LLM’s IIB solutions\nIn a seminal paper[4], LLM explicitly derived the most general, smooth 1/2 BPS solutions\nof IIB supergravity, that are invariant under SO(4) × SO(4) × R global symmetry. They\ncontain the non-vanishing R-R 5-form ﬂux of the form\nF(5) = Fµν dxµ ∧ dxν ∧ dΩ 3 + ˜Fµν dxµ ∧ dxν ∧ d˜Ω 3, (1)\nwhere µ,ν = 0 ,1,2,3, and dΩ 3 and d˜Ω 3 denote the volume forms of two three-spheres.\nThe two SO(4)s are the rotational symmetries of these two three-spheres respectively. The\ndilaton-axion moduli is constant and the 3-form ﬁeld strengths are set to be zero. Ac-\ncordingly, LLM geometry is determined explicitly by the following metric and R-R 5-form\nmeasured in the unit ls = 1,\nds2 = −h−2(dt+ Vidxi)2 + h2(dy2 + dxidxi) + yeGdΩ 2\n3 + ye−Gd˜Ω 2\n3,\nh−2 = 2 ycosh G, z = 1\n2 tanh G, (2)\ny∂yVi = ǫij ∂j z, y (∂iVj − ∂j Vi) = ǫij ∂yz,\nF(2) = Fµν dxµ ∧ dxν = dBt ∧ dt+ dA(1) = d(Btdt+ BtV + ˆB),\n˜F(2) = ˜Fµν dxµ ∧ dxν = d˜Bt ∧ dt+ d˜A(1) = d( ˜Btdt+ ˜BtV + ˆ˜B),\nBt = −1\n4y2e2G, ˜Bt = −1\n4y2e−2G,\ndˆB = −1\n4y3 ∗3 dz+ 1/2\ny2 dˆ˜B = −1\n4y3 ∗3 dz− 1/2\ny2 ,\nwhere i = 1 ,2, t = x0, y = x3. ∗3 is the ﬂat space epsilon symbol in the three dimensions\nparameterized by x1,x2,y. The full solution is determined by a single function z(x1,x2,y),\nwhich obeys the Laplace equation in six dimensions\n∂i∂i\nz\ny2 + 1\ny3 ∂y(y3∂y\nz\ny2 ) = 0 , (3)\nwith y acting like the radial coordinate in four dimensions. This solution is non -singular as\nlong as z = ±1\n2 on the two dimensional plane spanned by ( x1,x2) at y= 0.\nAs long as y >0, there are two 3-spheres S3 and ˜S3, corresponding to the two SO(4)\nisometries. At the y = 0 plane S3 shrinks to a point in the region with z = −1\n2 , while ˜S3\nshrinks in the region with z = 1\n2 . Following the setup in Section 2.4 of ref.[4], we may choose\na surface ˜Σ 2 in the ( y,x1,x2) space that ends at y = 0 on a closed non-intersecting curve\n6\nlying in a region with z = 1\n2 . A smooth ﬁve-manifold ˜Σ 5 can be constructed by the ﬁbration\nof ˜S3 over ˜Σ 2. The ﬁve-form ﬂux measured on this ﬁve-manifold is given by\n˜N = −µ3\n∫\n˜Σ 5\nF(5) = (Area)z=−1/2\n2π , (4)\nwhere here the normalization µ3 = T3 = (2 π)−3 in string units is used and (Area) z=−1/2 is\nthe area of the region with z = −1/2 inside ˜Σ on y = 0 plane. We can as well construct\nanother ﬁve-manifold Σ 5 by the ﬁbration of S3 over a surface Σ 2; Σ 2 ends in the region with\nz = −1\n2 of the y= 0 plane. The ﬁve-form ﬂux measured on Σ 5 is\nN = µ3\n∫\nΣ 5\nF(5) = (Area)z=1/2\n2π . (5)\nEquations (4) and (5) indicate that the area of each connected re gion with either z = 1\n2\nor z = −1\n2 on the y = 0 plane is quantized. This is because the total 5-ﬂux through any\nﬁve-sphere is quantized by Dirac quantization condition.\nThe LLM solutions (1) and (2) have been shown to have the energy e qual to the angular\nmomentum and to preserve 16 supersymmetries, so they are indee d geometries satisfying\nthe 1/2 BPS condition. They provide us a new theoretical setting to test the AdS/CFT\nduality at a new level.\nB. AdS5 × S5 from LLM\nThe LLM geometries are completely determined by the distribution of the sources for\nthe function z on the boundary y = 0 plane. AdS5 × S5 as the maximal BPS geometry is\na special case of the LLM geometries, with the sources uniformly dis tributed in a disk with\nz = −1/2 on the y = 0 plane. Then the solution of the six dimensional Laplace equation\n(3) is given by\nz(r,y; r0) = r2 − r2\n0 + y2\n2\n√\n(r2 + r2\n0 + y2)2 − 4r2r2\n0\n,\nVφ(r,y; r0) = 1\n2 − r2 + r2\n0 + y2\n2\n√\n(r2 + r2\n0 + y2)2 − 4r2r2\n0\n, (6)\nwhere ( r,φ) are the polar coordinates on the ( x1,x2) plane, and r0 is the radius of the disk.\nFor this isotropic solution, ˆB and ˆ˜B deﬁned in (2) can be expressed as\nˆB = K(r,y; r0)dφ, ˆ˜B = ˜K(r,y; r0)dφ, (7)\n7\nwhere K and ˜K are determined by the following diﬀerential equations\n∂rK = −ry\n4 ∂yz+ r\n2(z+ 1\n2), ∂ yK = ry\n4 ∂rz,\n∂r ˜K = −ry\n4 ∂yz+ r\n2(z− 1\n2), ∂ y ˜K = ry\n4 ∂rz. (8)\nIt is easy to check that the above equations are compatible with the Laplace equation (3).\nInserting (6) in the LLM solution (2) and performing the change of c oordinate\ny = r0 sinh ρsin θ,\nr = r0 cosh ρcos θ, (9)\nφ = ˜φ− t,\nwe obtain the standard AdS5 × S5 metric in the global coordinates\nds2 = r0[− cosh2 ρdt2 + dρ2 + sinh2 ρdΩ 2\n3 + dθ2 + cos2 θd˜φ2 + sin2 θd˜Ω 2\n3]. (10)\nMatching it with AdS5 × S5 geometry from the near-horizon limit of D3-branes, we have\nr0 = R2\nAdS = R2\nS =\n√\n4πgs ˜N. Meanwhile, from eq. (9) we see that the interior of the disk\non the y = 0 plane corresponds to ρ= 0, i.e., the center of AdS5, while the exterior of the\ndisk on the y= 0 plane corresponds to θ= 0, i.e., the north-pole of S5.\nThe last equation in (9) is linear in time. This implies that the LLM coordina tes and\nthe global coordinates of AdS5 × S5 diﬀer from each other by a relative frame rotation in\nthe ( x1,x2) plane. In the LLM frame, the AdS5 × S5 metric (10) is seen by an observer\nwho co-moves with a rotating frame in the ( x1,x2) plane. Conversely, in the global frame\nfor AdS5 × S5, an observer who moves along the ˜φ-circle in S5 will see the LLM metric (6)\ndetermined by a disk source. So the double scaling limit of large angular momentum and\nlarge radius of ˜φ-circle is just the PP-wave limit of AdS5 × S5 [15].\nFor convenience for the following discussions, we will evaluate the y→ 0 limit of various\nfunctions. For the interior of the disk, ( r2 <r2\n0), we have\nz → − 1/2, V φ → r2\nr2 − r2\n0\n, (11)\n\n\n\nBt → 0,\n˜Bt → − (r2−r2\n0)2\n4r2\n0\n,\n\n\n\nK → 0,\n˜K → − r2/4\n8\nwhile for the exterior of disk ( r2 >r2\n0),\nz → 1/2, V φ → − r2\n0\nr2 − r2\n0\n, (12)\n\n\n\nBt → − (r2−r2\n0)2\n4r2\n0\n,\n˜Bt → 0,\n\n\n\nK → r2/4,\n˜K → 0.\nWe see that the radii of the two three-spheres, S3 inside AdS5 and ˜S3 inside S5, are propor-\ntional to\n√\n|Bt| and\n√\n| ˜Bt|, respectively. Thus in the interior (exterior) of the disk at y= 0,\nS3 ( ˜S3) shrinks to zero size.\nC. Giant graviton revisited\nIn this subsection, we will revisit the giant graviton in AdS5 × S5[12], but use the LLM’s\nexpressions in which the R− R ﬁeld strength is slightly diﬀerent from that given in refs.\n[12, 13]. This re-formulation will be helpful for the discussions in sect ion V.\nA giant graviton is a spherical D3-brane, which has the same quantu m numbers as a\ngraviton. So the D3-brane wraps a 3-sphere either in AdS5 or in S5. Its dynamics is\ngoverned by the world-volume action\nS = −T3\n∫\nd4ξ\n√\n−det(P[G]ab) + T3\n∫\nP[C(4)]. (13)\nwhere Gµν and C(n) are the background metric and R-R n-form potential, respectively. P[· · ·]\ndenotes the pullback of the enclosed spacetime tensor to the bran e world-volume. For our\npurpose, we only consider D3-branes wrapping on a 3-sphere ˜S3 in S5. Then we may take\nthe static gauge:\nξ0 = t, ξm = ωm (m= 1 ,2,3), (14)\nwith ωm being the coordinates of ˜S3, and consider a trial solution of the form, in the polar\ncoordinates on the ( x1,x2) plane,\nr= ˜rr0 (0 < ˜r= const .≤ 1), y = 0 , φ = ˜φ(t) − t. (15)\nSubstituting the background metric (10), the R-R potential (1) a nd the ansatz (15) into the\nworld-volume action (13) and integrating over the angular coordina tes yield the following\nLagrangian\nL(t)/r2\n0 = −(1 − ˜r2)3/2\n√\n1 − ˜r2 ˙˜φ\n2\n+ ˜r4 ˙˜φ+ (1 − 2˜r2). (16)\n9\nThe corresponding Hamiltonian and the angular momentum J conjugate to ˜φ read\nH/r2\n0 =\n√\n(1 − ˜r2)3 + 1\n˜r2 (j− ˜r4)2 − (1 − 2˜r2),\nj = J\nr2\n0\n= (1 − ˜r2)3/2 ˜r2 ˙˜φ√\n1 − ˜r2 ˙˜φ\n2\n− ˜r4. (17)\nThe above Hamiltonian possesses two local minima. One of them is at ˜ r= 1, the boundary\nof the disk, where the D3-brane shrinks to point and behaves like an ordinary graviton.\nAnother minimum locates at ˜ r = √j for ﬁxed j ∈ [0,1). D3-branes at this minimum\npreserve non-vanishing size, and are called “giant gravitons” in the literature. The energy\nof those classical stable “giant gravitons” is given by\nEg = J = ˜r2r2\n0 = r2. (18)\nThis is precisely the 1 /2 BPS condition.\nIt is interesting to note that one always has ˙˜φ= 1 at these minima, independent of J. For\nan observer co-moving with the giant graviton, he/she sees that t he world-volume dynamics\nalong the circle is labeled by the variable ϕ = ˜φ− t. In other words, the Lagrangian (16)\nshould be rewritten as\nL(t) = 1\n2r2 ˙ϕ2 + r2 ˙ϕ+ · · · . (19)\nIt is obvious that a non-zero ˙ ϕ implies quantum ﬂuctuations of a giant graviton around its\nclassical stationary points.\nIII. 1/2 BPS DYNAMICS OF GIANT GRA VITONS IN LLM GEOMETRY\nNow let us add a few giant gravitons in the LLM geometry. Suppose th e number of\ngiant gravitons, M, is much less than the number of background ﬁve-form ﬂux ˜N, so that\nthe back-reaction of the giant gravitons on background geometr y can be ignored. They are\nassumed to be located at ρ = 0 (hence inside the z = −1/2 disk on the y = 0 plane) and\nto wrap ˜S3 in S5. We shall show that the background R-R ﬂux provides a homogeneo us\nmagnetic ﬁeld perpendicular to the y = 0 plane and the dynamics of giant graviton in the\n(x1,x2) plane at y= 0 is the same as that of electrons moving in a 2d plane with a constant\ntransversal magnetic ﬁeld.\n10\nThe low energy dynamics of giant gravitons in a ﬁxed background (wit hout NS B-ﬁeld)\nis known [16] to be described by the following non-Abelian generalizatio n of the DBI action\n(13)\nSDBI = −T3\n∫\nd4ξ STr\n√\n−det(P[Gab + Gai(Q−1 − δ)ijGjb ] + 2 πFab)det(Qi\nj), (20)\nwith1\nQi\nj = δi\nj + i[Xi,Xk]Gkj , (21)\nplus the Chern-Simons action [17], with the bosonic part\nSCS = T3\n∫\nSTr\n(\nP[eiiX iX (\n∑\nn\nC(n))]e2πF\n)\n, (22)\nsupplemented by proper fermionic terms . Here the transverse co ordinates Xi, as world-\nvolume scalar ﬁelds, are M × M matrices in the adjoint representation of the U(M) gauge\ngroup. STr( · · ·) denotes a symmetrical trace in gauge\ngroup. The operator i X is the contraction with Xi:\niX iX C(n) = 1\n(n− 2)!Xi1 Xi2 C(n)\ni1i2i3···in dxi3 ∧ · · · ∧ dxin . (23)\nNow we consider the giant gravitons locating at the center of AdS ( ρ = 0 ⇒ y = 0)\nand, as D3-branes, all wrapping on the same ˜S3 in S5. We take the static gauge (14) again\nfor the world-volume coordinates. Recall that our purpose is to st udy the 1/2 BPS sector\nin AdS/CFT duality, treated as a closed sector in view of the argumen ts given in ref. [6].\nThus we are allowed to truncate the degrees of freedom of the gian t gravitons to those in\nthe 1/2 BPS sector: Namely the world-volume gauge ﬁeld is taken to b e zero, and we turn\non the transverse scalar ﬁelds along x1,x2 directions only. (According to the arguments in\nref. [6], there exists a limit in which all other degrees of freedom are d ecoupled, i.e. they\ncost too much energy and therefore can be integrated out at low e nergy.) Thus by inserting\nthe background metric and ﬁve-form ﬁeld strength given by (1), ( 2) and (6) into (20) and\n(22), we obtain\nSBI = −2π2T3\n∫\ndtTr{4| ˜Bt| + 4| ˜Bt|Vi ˙Xi − 1\n2\n˙X2\ni + 1\n2[X1,X2]2} + · · · , (24)\n[1] We use i, j, k to denote the directions transverse to the branes, and a, b, c those along the branes.\n11\nand\nSCS = −8π2T3\n∫\ndtTr{ ˜Bt + ( ˜BtVi + ˆ˜Bi) ˙Xi} + · · · . (25)\nHere Xi’s have been restricted to the lowest order modes in the expansion o f spheric har-\nmonics on ˜S3, because we focus on the 1/2 BPS states. The dots “ · · ·” denotes higher order\nterms in powers of M/N that are suppressed in our probe approximation.\nThe quartic term plays no role in the 1/2 BPS sector. Using eqs. (11) and (12) in (24)\nand (25), we get a matrix model with the following Lagrangian:\nL(t) = 1\n2ls\nTr ˙X2\ni + 1\nl2\ns\nǫij TrXi ˙Xj, (26)\nwhere we have restored the ls-dependence and rescaled Xi by Xi →\n√\n4πXi.\nFor a single giant graviton, with M = 1, X1 and X2 become real numbers; then in polar\ncoordinates and with ρ= 0, the above Lagrangian is reduced to eq. (19). This consistency\nimplies that the Lagrangian (26) describes the quantum ﬂuctuation s of the giant graviton\naround their classical stationary point in the 1/2 BPS sector. On th e other hand, the\nLagrangian (26) with M = 1 precisely describes the Landau problem, for a non-relativistic\ncharged particle with mass m= 1 /ls moving in a constant magnetic ﬁeld B = 2 /l2\ns .\nFor the number of giant gravitons M >1, Xi’s are M × M matrices. Their diagonal\nelements describe the positions of the giant gravitons, while the oﬀ- diagonal elements de-\nscribe the interactions between the giant gravitons. At low energy , one may take the limit\nls → 0. This is equivalent to take the limit B/m → ∞ , i.e. the cyclotron frequency in the\nLandau problem tends to inﬁnity. However, for a large number of gia nt gravitons the clas-\nsical Lagrangian (26) does not provide a proper description for th e quantum giant-graviton\nﬂuid, since the 2-plane should become a non-commutative 2-plane wh en all giant gravitons\nare projected down to the lowest Landau levels (LLL). In the next section, we shall show\nthat the matrix model (26) has to be supplemented by a non-commu tativity constraint in\nan incompressible ﬂuid phase, so that the quantum behavior of the m any giant graviton\nsystem is that of a quantum Hall ﬂuid, described by a Chern-Simons m atrix model.\nTo conclude this section, we note that the Lagrangian (26) can be r ecast into a manifestly\nU(M) gauge invariant form:\nL(t) = m\n2 Tr(DXi)2 + B\n2 ǫij Tr(XiDXj), (27)\nwhere DXi = ˙Xi + i[A0,Xi] with A0 the electric potential.\n12\nIV. CHERN-SIMONS FINITE-MATRIX MODEL FOR GIANT GRA VITONS\nSince the essential non-commutativity condition is absent, the mat rix model (27) is not\nsuﬃcient to describe a QH ﬂuid. We shall show that this condition natu rally emerges as\nsoon as the quantum physics of giant gravitons is considered.\nA. Symmetry breaking\nSince the Lagrangian (27) is invariant under U(M) gauge symmetry, one of the Xs, e.g.\nX1, can be diagonalized by a gauge transformation 2. In this eigenvalue basis, with notation\n(X1)mn = δmnx1m,(X2)mn = ymn,ynn = x2n, a typical classical Lagrangian of the matrix\nmodel reads\nL= m\n2\n∑\ni,n\n˙x2\nin + m\n2\n∑\nm̸=n\n˙¯ymn ˙ymn + B\n2\n∑\ni,n\nǫij xi\nn ˙xj\nn − U(x,y). (28)\nHowever, quantum mechanically there is a non-trivial change of mea sure in path integral\nfrom the matrix-element basis to the eigenvalue basis. So the Hamilto nian in the quantum\ntheory is given by\nHq = − 1\n2m\n∑\ni,n\n1\n∆ 2 ( ∂\n∂xin\n− iBǫij xj )∆ 2( ∂\n∂xin\n− iBǫij xj ) − 1\n2m\n∑\nm,n\n∂\n∂¯ymn\n∂\n∂ymn\n+ U(x,y)\n= 1\n∆( x1)\n˜H∆( x1), (29)\nwhere ∆( x) = ∏\nn<m(xn −xm) is the Van der Monde determinant, and ˜H is the Hamiltonian\ncorresponding to the Lagrangian (28).\nThe eigenfunction ˜ψof ˜His related to an eigenfunction ψof Hq by ˜ψ(x,y) = ∆( x1)ψ(x,y).\nIt implies that the Hamiltonian (28) in the eigenvalue basis describes a q uantum system of\nparticles obeying Fermi statistics 3 from the requirement that any pair of x1n are diﬀerent. In\nother words, we may have two perspectives on the physics of giant gravitons at the quantum\nlevel. One is to use the Hamiltonian (29) of U(M) gauge symmetry to describe the quantum\nphysics, with M giant gravitons understood semiclassically coinciding. Another pers pective\n[2] Here we do not adopt the argument of using a complexiﬁed gauge group to diagonalize X1 and X2\nsimultaneously.\n[3] This is a 1-d fermion system instead of 2-d one, unlike that extrac ted from N = 4 SYM[6]. It indeed\nmakes sense at m/B → 0 because the phase space is two dimensional at this limit.\n13\nis to just use the Hamiltonian obtained from the classical Lagrangian (28) to describe the\nquantum ﬂuctuations of giant gravitons, leaving M giant gravitons separated from each other\non the ( x1,x2)-plane. In the latter case the world-volume gauge symmetry is bro ken from\nU(M) to U(1)M . So the degrees of freedom corresponding to the oﬀ-diagonal ele ments of\nX2, which give excitation modes of open string stretched between diﬀe rent giant gravitons,\nbecome heavy and are frozen out at the low energy limit ls → 0. In continuous ﬂuid\ndescription, two diﬀerent perspectives were referred as two diﬀe rent ﬂuids, the string ﬂuid\nand brane ﬂuid[19]. They should be related to each other, like the cor respondence between\nmatrix basis and eigenvalue basis in the toy matrix model discussed by Berenstein[6]. For\nour purpose, the latter perspective is more convenient. Thus we e nd up with the following\nLagrangian from Eq. (27):\nL=\n∑\nn\n[ m\n2 ˙x2\nin + B\n2 ǫij xi\nn ˙xj\nn − V(xin)\n]\n, (30)\nsupplemented with Fermi statistics condition. Here we have included a potential V(xin),\nwhich is assumed to arise from short-range interactions and will be s hown in the next section\nto naturally emerge when we choose a correct vacuum. The Lagran gian (30) describes a\ncollection of non-relativistic charged fermions moving in a plane subje ct to a perpendicular\nmagnetic ﬁeld. In the m/B → 0 limit, all particles are projected into the LLL, which is\ninﬁnitely degenerated. The degenerated states in the LLL are dist inguished by the quantum\nnumber of angular momentum j. Due to Fermi statistics, diﬀerent giant gravitons occupy\nstates with diﬀerent j.\nB. Incompressible Fluid description and non-commutative Chern-Simons theory 4\nFollowing refs. [3, 20], we treat the long distance behavior of the abo ve system as a\ndissipationelss ﬂuid. The discrete label n is replaced by a pair of continuous coordinates\n(y1,y2); these coordinates are co-moving coordinates subject to the c ondition that the density\nof particle number, ρ0, is constant. Accordingly, the Lagrangian (30) can be rewritten a s\nL(t) =\n∫\nd2y ρ0\n[ m\n2 ˙x2\ni (y) + B\n2 ǫij xi(y) ˙xj(y) − V(ρ0|∂y\n∂x|)\n]\n. (31)\n[4] This subsection does not contain new results. It just follows the treatment in [3, 20], to show how non-\ncommutativity comes about in our matrix model. The readers familiar w ith this issue may skip this\nsubsection.\n14\nThe potential V plays a role when distances among giant gravitons are small, i.e., it arise s\nout of short-range forces. It leads to an equilibrium when the real space density is ρ0. The\nfact that such an equilibrium state reaches the minimal energy is ess entially an assumption,\nwhich may not be true if the giant gravitons are in, say, a Wigner crys tal state. In the\nfollowing we shall always make this assumption as a working hypothesis . Thus, the Jacobian\n|∂y/∂x| equals to 1 in equilibrium.\nThe Lagrangian (31) is invariant under the area preserving diﬀeomo rphisms (APD) of\ny-plane, generated by the inﬁnitesimal transformations\nδyi = ǫij\n∂α(y)\n∂yj\n, ⇒ δxi = ǫjk\n∂xi\n∂yj\n∂α(y)\n∂yk\n. (32)\nSmall deviations from the equilibrium can be parameterized by a vecto r ﬁeld Ai, deﬁned by\nxi = yi + ǫij θAj , (33)\nwhere θ ≪ 1 is a convenient parameter to control the expansion. The APD (32 ) leads to\nthe following transformation for A:\nδAi = ∂˜α\n∂yi\n+ ǫlmθ∂Ai\n∂yl\n∂˜α\n∂ym\n, (34)\nwhere ˜α= α/θ. The ﬁrst term is in the standard form of an Abelian gauge transfor mation.\nMoreover, the APD invariance implies that there exists a conserved charge, given by\n∫\nd2yΠ iδxi. (35)\nIn the limit m/B → 0, the conjugate momentum density Π i ∝ ǫij xj . Then the conserved\ncurrent is the Jacobian from xto y. Thus, the equation of motion is supplemented with the\nconstraint\n|∂x\n∂y| = 1\n2ǫij ǫmn\n∂xm\n∂yi\n∂xn\n∂yj\n= 1 . (36)\nNamely the ﬂuid density in x-space is constant, or the ﬂuid is incompressible, since by\ndeﬁnition the ﬂuid density is constant in y-coordinates. This constraint can be viewed as\na Gauss law constraint and can be added into the action via a Lagrang ian multiplier A0 .\nThen in the limit m/B → 0, the Lagrangian reads\nL(t) =\n∫\nd2y ρ0\n[ B\n2 ǫij ( ˙xi − θ{xi,A0})xj + θA0 − V(ρ0|∂y\n∂x|)\n]\n, (37)\n15\nwhere the Poisson bracket is deﬁned by\n{F(y),G(y)} = ǫij ∂iF∂j G. (38)\nEqs. (34) and (38) exhibit the structure of non-commutative U(1) gauge theory with\nspatial-spatial non-commutativity: To the ﬁrst order in θexpansion, eq. (34) is nothing but\nnon-commutative gauge transformation, while eq. (38) is the non- commutative commutator.\nThis observation led Susskind to propose [3] that, beyond the linear order, the APD invari-\nance requires the action to be the non-commutative Chern-Simons (NCCS) theory (with\nν = 1 /Bθ)\nLNCCS = 1\n4πνǫµνρ\n(\nAµ ⋆∂ν Aρ + 2i\n3 Aµ ⋆Aν ⋆Aρ\n)\n, (39)\nand that (39) provides the correct framework for the quantum H all system with ν being\nthe ﬁlling fraction. The NCCS action (39) can be obtained from a non- commutative matrix\nmechanics. The NC matrix mechanics is given by\nL= B\n2 ǫij Tr( ˙Xi + i[A0,Xi])Xj + BθTrA0, (40)\nwith Xi = yi + ǫij θAj . Here the constant matrices yi are chosen to satisfy [ yi,yj] = iθǫij .\nCollecting the above ingredients together, we conclude that one sh ould add a term\nBθTrA0 into our matrix model (27) in the large B limit. This term yields a non-\ncommutativity constraint, and compensates the anomaly arising fr om the change of measure\nin the large B limit. The matrix Lagrangian (27) plus the additional term BθTrA0 will be\nshown to describe a quantum Hall system of giant gravitons. In this way, we have demon-\nstrated that the 1/2 BPS dynamics of giant gravitons in the LLM geo metry background is\nessentially that of a quantum Hall system.\nC. Edge excitations and a ﬁnite-matrix model for QHE\nThe Gauss law constraint that follows from the Lagrangian (40) implie s the non-\ncommutativity\n[X1,X2] = iθ, (41)\nwhich can be solved only with inﬁnite matrices. For ﬁnite matrices of or der M, this con-\nstraint can be satisﬁed only up to order 1 /M. To obtain a ﬁnite-matrix model with the\n16\nGauss law exactly satisﬁed, one needs to add extra degrees of fre edom. In our case, we ar-\ngue this necessity as follows. Since diﬀerent giant gravitons occupy diﬀerent states labelled\nby angular momentum j of the LLL, the distance between two nearest giant gravitons is\nof order\n√\nj/B −\n√\n(j− 1)/B ∼ ls/√j. When j is large enough, open string excitations\nstretched between the nearest giant gravitons may become very light and can be excited at\nlow energy. Obviously, these almost gapless excitations prefer j as large as possible, namely\nin the region close to the boundary of the quantum Hall droplet. In t he ﬂuid description,\nwe may introduce a boundary Lagrangian to describe these excitat ions:\nLb =\n∫\nd2yρ0δ(Γ(y1,y2))\n[ mb\n2\n˙φ∗(y) ˙φ(y) + i\n2B( ˙φ∗φ− φ∗ ˙φ) − Bµb\n2 φ∗(y)φ(y)\n]\n, (42)\nwhere Γ( y1,y2) = 0 deﬁnes the boundary, φ(y) is a complex ﬁeld deﬁned on the boundary\nonly and µb ∼ 1/(Mls). In fact, there are apparently two boundary ﬁelds and, later, w e will\nshow that they correspond to the continuum limit of the oﬀ-diagona l elements ( Xi)1n and\n(Xi)n1 or their complex combination\nΨ n1 = ( X1)n1 + i(X2)n1, Ψ 1n = ( X1)1n + i(X2)1n. (43)\n(Here the convention is that the giant graviton with the largest j is labelled by index “1”).\nHowever, half of them can always be gauged away by the residual U(1)M gauge symmetry,\nand only one boundary ﬁeld is physical. (This corresponds to the well- known fact that the\nedge states of a quantum Hall droplet are chiral, in the sense that e dge wave propagates\nalong the boundary only in one direction, not in the opposite direction .)\nUnder an inﬁnitesimal APD, φ(y) transforms as (32). But the conserved charge now is\ngiven by\n∫\nd2y ρ0Π iδxi +\n∫\nd2yρ0δ(Γ(y1,y2))(Π φδφ+ Π φ∗ δφ∗). (44)\nFor small B, it implies a vortex-like excitation at the boundary. In the large- B limit, it\nchanges the constraint (36) to\n1\n2ǫab{xa,xb} − 2i{φ∗,φ}δ(Γ) = 1 . (45)\nThus, with a large B, we get a Lagrangian to describe this ﬂuid with edge excitations:\nL(t) =\n∫\nd2y ρ0\n[ B\n2 ǫij( ˙xi − θ{xi,A0})xj + θA0 − V(ρ0|∂y\n∂x|)\n]\n−\n∫\nd2y ρ0δ(Γ)\n[\niBφ∗( ˙φ− θ{A0,φ}) + Bµb\n2 φ∗φ\n]\n. (46)\n17\nIt has been mentioned in the previous subsection that {A,B} is the ﬁrst order truncation\nof the non-commutative commutator [ A,B]⋆ = A ⋆ B− B ⋆ Adeﬁned by star product,\nand the full expression is assumed to be the result of the substitut ion of Poisson brackets\nby the non-commutative commutators. Following the same logic, we p ass from the above\nLagrangian to the matrix description by the replacements\n∫\nd2y ρ0 → Tr, θ {A,B} → [A,B],\n∫\nd2y ρ0δ(Γ)A→ A11, (47)\nwhere again the index “1” is referred to the giant graviton with the m aximal angular mo-\nmentum j in LLL. In particular, one has\nθ\n∫\nd2y ρ0δ(Γ)φ∗{A0,φ} → Ψ †\n1m(A0)mnΨ n1 − Ψ 1m(A0)mnΨ †\nn1. (48)\nWe have mentioned that half of degrees of freedom in Ψ 1m and Ψ m1 may be gauged away.\nFinally we obtain a matrix model described by the following U(M) invariant Lagrangian:\nL= B\n2 Tr(ǫij XiDXj + θA0) + BΨ †(iDΨ − µbΨ) , (49)\nwhere Ψ transforms as fundamental representation under U(M). In the above Lagrangian\nwe have taken the limit m/B → 0.\nThe matrix model presented in (49) is slightly diﬀerent from Polychro nakos’s ﬁnite matrix\nmodel[18] by the absence of a conﬁning X2 potential. However, eq. (18) indicates that the\ngiant gravitons are actually conﬁned around the origin to minimalize th eir energy. It means\nthat the matrix Lagrangian (49), though capturing the most impor tant features of the\ngiant graviton system, does not accommodate all information of th e system. To be precise,\nthe Hamiltonian, H′, obtained from the matrix Lagrangian (49) describes only the quan tum\nﬂuctuations of giant gravitons around the classical stationary po int or the corresponding 1/2\nBPS geometries/states. In other words, we should identify H′ = H− H0, where H0 = J is\nthe energy of 1/2 BPS states. Because the angular momentum J should be treated quantum\nmechanically, the system must be quantized with the full Hamiltonian H, instead of merely\nH′. Recalling that H′ = HΨ = BµbΨ †Ψ, supplemented with the Gauss law constraint, the\nfull Hamiltonian is of the following form:\nH = J + HΨ = B\n2mTr(X1\n∂L\n∂ ˙X2\n− X2\n∂L\n∂ ˙X1\n) + HΨ = B2\n4mTr(X2\n1 + X2\n2 ) + HΨ . (50)\n18\nThe X-part of the above Hamiltonian behaves as M2 harmonic oscillators in the matrix\nbasis, since X1 and X2 are conjugated each other.\nV. GIANT GRA VITON FLUID AS FRACTIONAL QUANTUM HALL FLUID\nIn this section we shall quantize the ﬁnite-matrix Hamiltonian (50) su pplemented with\nGauss law constraints derived from from the Lagrangian (49), to s how that indeed the 1/2\nBPS dynamics of giant gravitons in AdS5 × S5 allows the formation of fractional quantum\nHall (FQH) ﬂuids with ﬁlling factor ν = 1 /k, with k a positive odd number. There are\nseveral approaches to quantize this model: (1) Canonical approa ch with Gauss’ constraint;\n(2) Path integral approach; (3) Reduced canonical approach (ﬁ rst to solve the classical\nconstraints and then to quantize). Though they all lead to essent ially the same physics,\neach approach has its own advantages in revealing some aspects of the underlying physics.\nA. “Classical” quantum Hall droplet\nThe Gauss law constraint derived from the Lagrangian (49),\nG= −i[X1,X2] + ΨΨ † − θ= 1\n2[A,A†] + ΨΨ † − θ= 0 , (51)\nimplies that the energy is discrete, even at the classical level, with an energy gap of order\nθ. To reveal this, we need to solve the above constraint as well as th e classical equations of\nmotion. Classically, inserting the solution of equation of motion,\nX1 + iX2 = A, Ψ = e−iµbt√\nMθ|v⟩, (52)\nwith A a constant M × M matrix and |v⟩ a constant vector of unit length, into the Hamil-\ntonian (50), we obtain\nH = B2\n4mTrA†A+ MBθµb. (53)\nIn the oscillator basis, we may choose |v⟩ = |M − 1⟩. The traceless part of the con-\nstraint (51) has many solutions for A. Each of these solutions corresponds to a diﬀerent\ndistribution of the giant gravitons on the 2-plane. For example, the solution corresponding\nto the ground state is\nA=\n√\n2θ\nM−1∑\nn=1\n√n|n− 1⟩⟨n|. (54)\n19\nIt yields the radius squared matrix:\nR2 = X2\n1 + X2\n2 = 1\n2(A†A+ AA†)\n=\nM−2∑\nn=0\nθ(2n+ 1)|n⟩⟨n| + θ(M − 1)|M− 1⟩⟨M− 1|. (55)\nSemi-classically the M giant gravitons in this case are uniformly distributed in the ( x1,x2)\nplane on a disk with radius\n√\n2Mθ, (see Fig. 1a), with density ρgg = 1 /(2πθ) and the inverse\nﬁlling factor ν−1 = B/(2πρgg ) = Bθ in the analogy to the QH “droplet”. Later we will show\nthat this droplet can generally be in a FQH liquid phase when the density is at the right\nvalue. The total classical energy of this system is\nE = B2\n4mθM(M − 1) + MBθµb.\nThe classical energy contributed by the edge states is order Mµb ∼ 1/ls, and can be ignored\ncompared with the energy contributed by Xi. This is consistent with the known fact that\nthe edge excitations are essentially gapless.\na) b) c)\nFIG. 1: The giant gravitons in AdS5 × S5 and its analogy to the QH\n“droplet”. The gray region denotes the AdS5 × S5 background. The giant\ngravitons are uniformly distributed on the black region and the quasi-hole\nexcitations in this giant graviton background are denoted b y the white re-\ngion. a) The (fractional) QH ‘droplet” formed from the conde nsation of the\ngiant gravitons. b) A quasi-hole excitation at origin. c) Se veral quasi-hole\nexcitations.\nAnother interesting special solution is\nA=\n√\n2θ\n(\n√q|M − 1⟩⟨0| +\nM−1∑\nn=1\n√n+ q|n− 1⟩⟨n|\n)\n, (56)\n20\nwhere q >0. It is known to be a quasi-hole excitation with charge −q(a defect) at the origin\nin the FQH background (Fig. 1b). It increases the radius of the sta te |m⟩ from\n√\n(2m+ 1)θ\nto\n√\n(2m+ 2q+ 1)θ. This corresponds to the excitation of the giant graviton at the j = 0\nstate (with j the angular momentum in LLL) to the j = 1 state, while the giant graviton\nat the j = ℓstate is excited to the j = ℓ+ 1 state, etc. The total number of giant gravitons\nis unchanged. Finally, a rather general solution can be constructe d as follows:\nA=\n√\n2θ\nm∑\ni=1\n\n√\nqi|ni⟩⟨ni−1| +\nni∑\nn=ni− 1+1\n√n+ qi|n− 1⟩⟨n|\n\n, (57)\nwhere |n0⟩ = |0⟩, |nm⟩ = |M − 1⟩ and m ≪ M. This solution can interpreted as several\nquasi-hole excitations with charges −qi, at diﬀerent radii in the QH background (Fig.1c).\nEach of these solutions corresponds to a classical, stable conﬁgur ation of the giant gravitons.\nFinally, we remark that both the classical Hamiltonian and the angular momentum de-\npend on the trace of the radius-squared matrix only. Therefore, both the energy and angular\nmomentum are quantized, even at the classical level.\nB. Gauss’ law in the canonical approach\nTo quantize the matrix model (49), we treat the matrix elements of X1 and X2 as oper-\nators, and impose the canonical commutation relations\n[(X1)mn,(X2)rs] = i\nBδmrδns, (58)\nbecause the Lagrangian is ﬁrst order in time derivative. Hereafter we shall use the boldface\nletters to denote operators in the quantum theory. The Hamiltonia n for the X’s is so ordered\nas to be given by ( Z = X1 + iX2)\nHX = B2\n4m\n∑\nmn\n(Z†\nmnZmn + 1\nB), (59)\ncorresponding to M2 harmonic oscillators. The components of the column vector Ψ corre-\nspond to M oscillators and are quantized to be bosons with the commutation rela tions\n[Ψ m,Ψ †\nn] = 1\nBδmn. (60)\nFurther the operator ordering ambiguity in the quantum version of the classical Gauss’\nlaw constraint (51) is ﬁxed by requiring that as quantum generator s of unitary rotations\n21\nof both X1, X2 and Ψ , the operator G should satisfy the commutation relations of the\nU(M) algebra. Therefore, the traceless ( SU(M)) part of the Gauss’ law operator G can\nbe constructed as the sum of two terms, GX and GΨ , which are the well-known bilinear\nrealization of the SU(M) algebra in the Fock basis of bosonic oscillators in the adjoint and\nfundamental representations, respectively.\nG ≡ GX + GΨ\n= −i\n(\nZ†\nmkZnk − Z†\nnkZmk\n)\nEmn + Ψ †\nmTa\nmnΨ nTa (61)\nwhere Emn is the matrix with only the element at the m-th row and n-th column being one\nand all other elements zero; Ta is the matrix for the generator of SU(M) in the fundamental\nrepresentation. Then the traceless part of the quantum Gauss’s law is given by\n(Ga\nX + Ga\nΨ )|phys>= 0 . (62)\nThe U(1) part of the quantum Gauss’s law, similar to that in quantum electr odynamics,\njust requires the total U(1) charge of the model to vanish:\n(Ψ †\nmΨ m − Mθ)|phys> = 0 . (63)\nThe two constraints (62) and (63) together require the physical states to be U(M) singlets.\nC. Quantization of the inverse ﬁlling factor\nBecause of purely group-theoretical reasons, Gauss’ law const raints (62) and (63) impose\na severe restriction on the possible value for the parameter Bθ, which is closely related to\nthe inverse ﬁlling factor ν−1 for giant gravitons. Eq. (62) requires that the physical states\nare invariant under SU(M). Consequently, the representation of GX and that of GΨ must\nbe conjugate to each other, so that it is possible to form an SU(M) singlet. The X-part\nis known to be formed by the tensor product of the adjoint repres entations, so it contains\nonly the irreducible representations with Young tableau having an int egral multiple of M\nboxes. The same must be true for the conjugate representation s for the Ψ-part. Moreover,\nsince eq. (63) is realized on bosonic oscillators, it contains all the sym metric irreducible\nrepresentations of SU(M), whose Young tableau consists of a single row. Therefore, the\nnumber of boxes equals the eigenvalue of the total number operat or for Ψ-oscillators. In this\n22\nway [18], the Gauss’ law plus group theory require that MBθ be an integral multiple of M,\nor simply\nBθ = ℓ= 0 ,1,2,.... (64)\nThis quantization in the Chern-Simons ﬁnite-matrix model can also be viewed from sev-\neral diﬀerent angles. For example, it can be understood as anomaly cancellation a la Callan\nand Harvey [21]. The anomaly here is referred as the Gauss law anoma ly, i.e. [ X1,X2] = iθ,\ncan not be satisﬁed by any ﬁnite matrices. Then one introduces the boundary degrees of\nfreedom and the anomaly is cancelled or “compensated” by the boun dary contributions when\nBθ is quantized. On the other hand, one may also consider this as the ﬁn ite-matrix model\nversion of the level quantization for the non-commutative Chern- Simons (NCCS) term. This\nis because the second term of the Lagrangian (49) is of the form fo r the NCCS density:\nL = 4πκ\n3 θ\n∫\nǫµνρ TrDµDν Dρ (65)\nwith the coeﬃcient κ = Bθ/4π. Here we have viewed the coordinates Xi as the covariant\nderivative operators: Xi ∼ θDi and D0 = −i∂t + A0, a trick often used in the matrix model\nof D0-branes [24]. The level quantization [22, 23] requires the level 4πκ = ℓ be integers,\nwhich is nothing but eq. (65). Finally, the same quantization has a top ological origin in\npath integral, by requiring the complex density exp {i\n∫\ndtL(t)} in path integral measure to\nbe invariant under large U(M) Gauge transformations along a path with nonzero winding in\nthe compactiﬁed temporal direction. The 1d Chern-Simons term tr A0 changes under large\nU(1) transformations, so its invariance leads to the quantization (6 4).\nThe quantization condition (64) immediately indicates the quantizatio n of the inverse\nﬁlling factor, ν−1. Classically ν−1 = Bθ. However, there is a quantum correction to this\nidentiﬁcation: namely, quantum mechanically we have\nν−1 = k= ℓ+ 1 = 1 ,2,3,... . (66)\nCertainly this is consistent with the known fact that there is a level s hift, ℓ → ℓ+ 1, in\nquantum U(1) NCCS theory [22, 23]. For our ﬁnite-matrix model, the quantum correction\nis due to the operator reordering eﬀects in the radius squared mat rix, R2, which semiclas-\nsically determines the “area” occupied by the giant gravitons. Name ly upon quantization,\nthe expression of Tr R2 acquires an additional “zero-point energy” term, M2/B, according\n23\nto the quantization condition (58). This additional contribution to T rR2 increases the ra-\ndius of each “semi-classical orbit” from the classical value\n√\n(2n− 1)θ, (n = 1 ,2,...,M )\nto\n√\n(2n− 1)(θ+ 1/B). Thus, the area of the giant graviton droplet is increased due to\nquantum eﬀects: Area ≃ 2πM(θ+ 1 /B) for M ≫ 1. Since the ﬁlling factor is deﬁned by\nν = 2 πM/(B× Area), we obtain ν−1 = ℓ+ 1 ≡ k by using the quantization condition (64).\nSo much for the mathematical derivation of the quantization condit ion (66). Here some\nremarks on its physical meaning are in order. The quantization cond ition (66) for the ﬁlling\nfactor ν, on one hand, is similar in nature to the Dirac quantization of the mono pole charge,\nin that the allowed values are special, directly related to the consiste ncy of the quantum\ndynamics. On the other hand, it is diﬀerent from the Dirac condition in that it deals with\nthe behavior of a quantum many-body system as a whole. Eq. (4) together with (11) tell us\nthat Br2\nm/2 = ˜n= integer, where ˜nis the number of the background ﬂuxes in the area with\nradius rm. Then using previous discussions one has\n˜n= Br2\nM /2 = kM. (67)\nThis result together eq. (4) yield the density of the giant gravitons on ( x1,x2)-plane:\nρgg = 1\n2πk. (68)\nFor k = 1, the giant graviton density is the same as that of LLM fermions in t he original\nIQH droplet for AdS5 × S5. However, for k >1 the quantization condition (66) tells us\nthat something special happens at the particular values (68) of th e giant graviton ﬂuid\ndensity. A monopole charge that does not satisfy the Dirac quantiz ation condition simply\ncan not exist. However, a system of giant gravitons with a density w hich does not satisfy the\nquantization condition (66) still exists, but they can not be in the pa rticular states described\nby the ground state of the Chern-Simons matrix model. Namely self o rganization of giant\ngravitons into a new incompressible quantum ﬂuid may happen only at t he special densities\ngiven by eq. (68).\nThe above condition indicates that θ∼ l2\ns . No further condition exists to require ν must\nbe equal to 1, so in general the ﬁlling factor is allowed to be a fraction ν = 1 /k, with k an\ninteger. Hence giant gravitons probing AdS5 × S5 can be in a QH state with either integer\nor fractional ﬁlling factor, depending on the density of giant gravit ons on the ( x1,x2) plane\nat y= 0.\n24\nD. Interactions between giant gravitons\nTo determine the interaction between giant gravitons, we had bett er adopt the reduced\ncanonical approach. At the classical level, the Gauss law constrain t (51) can be solved [18]\nin the eigenvalue basis of X1 by\nΨ = e−iµbt√\nMθ|v⟩, |v⟩ = 1√\nM\n(1,1,..., 1)T ,\n(X1)mn = xnδmn, (X2)mn = ynδmn + iθ\nxm − xn\n(1 − δmn). (69)\nThis solution implies that xm ̸= xn for m̸= n. It is consistent with our previous argument\nthat the world-volume gauge symmetry of the giant gravitons brea ks from U(M) to U(1)M .\nSubstituting the solution (69) into the classical Hamiltonian (53), on e obtains the classical\nHamiltonian in terms of the variables xm [18]:\nHca = 1\nm\nM∑\nm=1\n(p2\nm + B2\n4 x2\nm) + 1\n4m\n∑\nn̸=m\n(Bθ)2\n(xm − xn)2 . (70)\nHca is nothing but the integrable one-dimensional Calogero model [25] f or non-relativistic\nparticles on a line.\nThen we want to quantize the system. The correct way is not to impo se the canonical\ncommutation relations directly to the variables xn and pn in eq. (70). We should solve the\nquantum version of Gauss law constraint in the eigenvalue basis of X1, and then substitute\nthe solution into the Hamiltonian (53). Non-commutativity of the qua ntum operators shifts\nthe strength of the two-body inverse square potential from ℓ2 to ℓ(ℓ+ 1) [18], or in terms of\nthe inverse ﬁlling factor k:\nHca = 1\nm\nM∑\nm=1\n(− ∂2\n∂x2\nm\n+ B2\n4 x2\nm) + 1\n4m\n∑\nn̸=m\nk(k− 1)\n(xm − xn)2 . (71)\nThe shift in the strength of the two-body inverse square potentia l is apparently related to\nthe level shift, ℓ→ ℓ+ 1, in U(1) non-commutative Chern-Simons theory [22, 23].\nIt is well-known that with k = 1 this model describes a free fermion system [26], which\ncorresponds to the ν = 1 IQH droplet in phase space and agrees with the observations mad e\nin the LLM geometry[4] and in the matrix model for AdS/CFT[6] for 1/ 2 BPS geometries.\nThe essential information we obtain from the Hamiltonian (70) in the p resent context is that\nthe two-body interactions between giant gravitons due to quantu m ﬂuctuations of stretched\n25\nopen strings are repulsive for k >1. In condensed matter physics, the repulsive nature of the\ninteractions is considered to be a crucial condition for the formatio n of new incompressible\nQH ﬂuid states. Indeed, the ground-state wave function of the C alogero model\nΨ 0(x1,x2,· · ·) =\n∏\nm<n\n(xm − xn)k exp{−B\n2\n∑\nn\nx2\nn}, (72)\nis nothing but the 1d representation (in the Landau gauge) of the L aughlin wave function\nin the LLL with ν = 1 /k on a disk geometry. Similar correspondence exists for excited\nstates. (For more discussions on the explicit relationship between t he Calogero model and\nthe FQHE, see ref. [27].) Thus, from the quantum Calogero model ob tained in our present\ncontext, we have demonstrated that the ground state of the QH system of giant gravitons at\nthe right value of density, ν = 1 /k with k >1 integer, is in a strongly correlated quantum\nﬂuid phase, an incompressible FQH ﬂuid of giant gravitons! (Actually k should be an odd\ninteger; see next subsection.)\nE. New Area Quantization and Stringy Exclusion Principle\nTo gain more insight into the FQH state of giant gravitons with k >1, we note that\n⟨n|R2|n⟩ − ⟨n− 1|R2|n− 1⟩ = 2 θ. (73)\nThus a giant graviton in the FQH droplet with k >1 occupies a k times bigger area than\nthe k= 1 case. This predicts a new area quantization for the FQH state of giant gravitons.\nPreviously in the ﬂuid description we have already seen that the dens ity of giant gravitons\nin the FQH droplet is ktimes bigger than that of LLM fermions in the original IQH droplet.\nBut that is only a coarse-grained description on average. The resu lt (73) in the matrix\nmodel is a property at the microscopic level. This microscopic proper ty is a compelling\nevidence that the ground state of the Chern-Simons matrix model (49) corresponds to a new\nincompressible quantum ﬂuid state, a FQH ﬂuid state. This makes the FQH state distinct\nfrom other possible states of the system with the same fractional ﬁlling factor, say from a\ndilute gas phase which is compressible. We expect that the stability of the FQH state may\nsurvive from the back-reactions of the giant gravitons. Namely th e new area quantization\n(73), which is k times bigger than that in the smooth 1/2 BPS LLM’s geometries, shou ld\nemerge in the new geometry that arises due to the back-reactions of giant gravitons.\n26\nThis is a new aspect of the giant graviton physics. It implies a stringy exclusion principle\nat work. This stringy exclusion principle diﬀers from the one discusse d previously [12, 28], in\nthat it deals with a strong correlation eﬀect of many giant gravitons , rather than a property\nof a single giant graviton. This stringy exclusion principle is actually an a nalogy of the\ngeneralized exclusion principle in condensed matter physics [29, 30] t hat is at work in the\nFQH state.\nWe may also examine the state (56) with quasi-hole excitations. The v alue of the quasi-\nhole charge −q is arbitrary in the classical theory. It can be shown [18] that, to ac company\nthe quantization of the ﬁlling factor ν, there is also a quantization of q, with the minimal\nvalue q = 1 /k. By the standard treatment of the Calogero model (71), we expe ct that\nin addition to the fractional charge q = 1 /k, the quasi-holes in the FQH liquid state of\ngiant gravitons should have both fractional exchange (anyon) st atistics with θstat = π/k\n[31, 32], and fractional exclusion statistics with λqh = 1 /k. This value of exclusion statistics\nparameter for quasi-holes is just dual to the exclusion statistics p arameter of the giant\ngravitons in the FQH state, λgg = k [33, 34].\nThe possible values of the inverse ﬁlling factor k can be further constrained by consid-\neration of quantum statistics. From the exchange statistics in one dimension in the sense\nof ref. [31] in terms of the scattering phase shift, exp( −iπk), k should be odd because the\nconstituent LLM particles are fermions. The same restriction can b e obtained by considering\nanyon statistics for quasi-hole in two dimensions, which is the same as that in the Calogero\nmodel [27]. The argument goes as follows [35]: Consider a cluster of co incident kquasi-holes.\nIt has a charge just opposite to that of the constituent giant gra viton, so it is the same as the\ncharge of the original LLM particle. If in the spectrum the only stat es that carry the same\ncharge are those of the hole of constituent giant gravitons, or th e LLM particle, the cluster\nof coinciding quasi-holes should be identiﬁed to be an original LLM part icle, including their\nstatistical behavior. The statistics of a cluster of k anyons is known [36] to be k2θstat, which\nis just kπ. It should be the same as that of the original LLM particle which is kno wn to be\na fermion. So we should choose\nk= odd= 1 ,3,5,· · · (74)\nfor the giant graviton FQH ﬂuids.\n27\nF. Back-reaction of giant gravitons: speculations\nIn above study of 1/2 BPS dynamics of giant gravitons in the AdS5 × S5 background,\nthe back-reaction of giant gravitons is neglected. This approximat ion is valid if the number\nM of the giant gravitons satisfy M ≪ ˜N; ˜N is the number of the R-R 5-ﬂux in AdS5 × S5\nbackground. This implies that the size of the giant graviton droplet, of the order of √\ngsMls\nwhen all fundamental constants are restored, is much smaller tha n that of the IQH droplet,√\ngs ˜Nls. Due to the extraordinary stability of the FQH state, one expects that the emergence\nof the FQH state and many of their properties, such as new area qu antization and stringy\nexclusion principle for quasi-holes etc, may survive from the back-r eactions of giant gravitons.\nIn this subsection we speculate on this possibility.\nIn subsection V.A and V.C, we have seen that M giant gravitons are distributed semi-\nclassically in a disk on the ( x1,x2) plane with uniform density 1 /(2πk). This semi-classical\nresult is expected to survive in the full quantum theory. When k = 1, this QH droplet\nvacuum corresponds to a quasi-hole disk as a z = 1 /2 region in the center of the ν = 1 IQH\ndroplet in the LLM geometry [4]. This recovers the known result that the back-reactions of\ngiant gravitons in the IQH state with k= 1 give rise to new smooth 1/2 BPS geometries [4].\nFor k >1 case, the droplet of giant gravitons has a k times larger area than the k = 1\ncase in the center of the LLM’s IQH background on the ( x1,x2) plane. Accordingly, the\ndroplet of giant gravitons has a smaller density so it is a fractional quantum Hall ﬂuid with\ngiant graviton ﬁlling factor νgg = 1 /k. In the region of the giant graviton FQH droplet, we\nhave actually a two-component ﬂuid, with the second component be ing the original IQH\nbackground ﬂuid, so that the total density of the original fermion s in the region of the FQH\ndroplet of the giant gravitons is ρ = ( k− 1)/(2πk). Suppose that the back-reaction of the\ngiant gravitons in such a FQH state can be, at least in a certain decou pling limit, restricted\nto the 1/2 BPS sector of geometries then a new 1/2 BPS geometry in IIB supergravity\nwill appear due to the back-reactions. Since the FQH state with k >1 corresponds to a\nQH droplet with a region in which the density of original fermions is betw een 0 and 1, the\ncorresponding LLM solutions will have a null singularity, according to refs. [4, 37, 38]. This\nnull singularity is believed to be resolved by possible local quantum eﬀe cts [39, 40, 41] and has\nwell-deﬁned description in dual CFT[14]. If the back-reactions in the full IIB supergravity\ncan not be restricted semi-classically to the 1/2 BPS sector, then o rbifold singularities are\n28\npossible to arise in the less-than-half BPS cases. So in general we ex pect that back-reactions\nof giant gravitons in a FQH state would lead to the emergence of geom etries with (naked)\nsingularities.\nSince a FQH state is a well-behaved quantum state, which maintains lon g-distance quan-\ntum coherence (more precisely, algebraic oﬀ-diagonal long-range order) [42, 43], we believe\nquantum eﬀects in IIB string theory on the corresponding geomet ry should resolve the singu-\nlarity. The properties of the FQH state may help us understand the underlying mechanism\nin quantum gravity for the resolution of singularity.\nVI. SUMMARY\nIn this paper, we re-examined the dynamics of giant gravitons prob ing AdS5 × S5 ge-\nometry, inspired by LLM’s 1/2 BPS geometry in IIB supergravity. Th e giant gravitons we\nexamined are D3-branes wrapping on a three-sphere inside S5 and, in the spirit of mini-\nsuperspace approximation for the moduli space of the 1/2 BPS geo metries, their dynamics\nis restricted to that on a two dimensional plane in AdS5 × S5. The non-abelian low-energy\ndynamics of the giant graviton probes is shown to lead to a Chern-Sim ons matrix model,\nwhich describes the ﬂuid dynamics of a QH system, i.e. a system of non -relativistic charged\nparticles moving in a strong constant magnetic ﬁeld. In terms of inco mpressible giant gravi-\nton ﬂuid, the gauge symmetry of the matrix model is broken from U(M) down to U(1)M ,\nand an additional non-commutative constraint is supplemented to t he matrix model action.\nThe D-brane nature of the giant gravitons dictates that edge sta tes are excited when the\nboundary of the giant graviton droplet ﬂuctuates. Indeed, the lo w energy world-volume\ntheory for a giant graviton ﬂuid reduces to a Chern-Simons ﬁnite-m atrix model, which is\nknown to incorporate the edge excitations of a QH droplet of ﬁnite s ize, with either the\ninteger or the fractional ﬁlling factor. We discussed various physic al analogies between the\ngiant graviton ﬂuid and the FQH liquid, and speculated the possibility th at the FQH nature\nof the giant graviton ﬂuid may survive beyond the probe approximat ion and give rise to new\ngeometry with singularity in IIB supergravity. In short, our result s demonstrate that the\ngiant gravitons, as quasi-hole excitations in AdS5 × S5 droplet background, can condense\ninto a new quantum Hall ﬂuid with ﬁlling factor ν = 1 /k for k an odd integer.\nIt is interesting to ask whether there is a QH analogy in the open strin g ﬂuid (mentioned\n29\nin sect. IV.A), in which the U(M) gauge symmetry is unbroken. The experience with\nthe SYM matrix model[6] indicates that the answer should be “YES”, b ecause there is\na one-to-one correspondence between the matrix basis ( M2 uncoupled bosonic oscillators)\nand the eigenvalue basis ( M free fermions) in the matrix model. To show the QH analogy\nexplicitly, we note that each of M2 uncoupled identical oscillators behaves exactly the same\nas a charged particle in a magnetic ﬁeld. Then we may introduce the no n-commutativity\nconstraint again by assuming the system is in an incompressible ﬂuid st ate. (This assumption\nis self-consistent if the interactions are repulsive.) The bosonic sta tistics will not interfere\nwith the formation of an incompressible ﬂuid provided interactions ar e repulsive, which make\nthe multi-occupied single particle states unfavorable energetically. So the system can be in\nan incompressible quantum ﬂuid, analogous to bosonic Laughlin state s with ﬁlling fraction\nν = 1 /k for even k.\nOne may also consider D3-brane probes wrapping on S3 inside AdS5. These giant gravi-\ntons are located in the exterior of the circle r2 = r2\n0, and are viewed as quasi-particle\nexcitations of the AdS5 × S5 droplet. As charged particles, they also couple to a constant\nbackground magnetic ﬁeld, but now the number of the magnetic ﬂux is N instead of ˜N\n(see (4) and (5)). This is a system dual to the one considered in this paper. It would be\ninteresting to study the condensation of these giant gravitons an d ask whether there is a\nQH analogy for this system.\nWe conclude this paper with a short comment on the emergent QHE fr om the N = 4\nSYM side in AdS/CFT correspondence. Ref. [9] made a remarkable ins piring attempt in\nthis direction. The 1/2 BPS sector for a single chiral scalar in N = 4 SYM compactiﬁed\non S3 is a matrix model. A Chern-Simons term emerges in this matrix model if a n internal\ncircle is boosted in the bulk theory as that shown by the last equation in (9). So it is an\neducated guess that, following the procedures presented in this p aper, we will end up with\nFQH systems with ﬁlling fractions of the form 1 /k for odd k [44].\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors thank Li-Sheng Tseng and Eric Sharpe for helpful disc ussions.
