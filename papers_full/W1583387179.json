    "abstract": "Piezoelectric transformer (PZT) is a device which transforms voltage by piezoelectric effect and converse piezoelectric effect of ceramic material. Compared with electromagnetic transformer, it has favorable characteristics of miniaturization, electromagnetic-noise free and the variable voltage gain with frequency and impedance. The modeling of piezoelectric transformer is the base of control and optimize. The principle of transforming voltage is presented in this paper. In addition, different modeling methods were brought into comparisons. Merits, shortcomings and the future work in modeling of PZT were given.",
