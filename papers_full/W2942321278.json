INTRODUCTION\nMineral oil has been widely used in power transformers\nto serve as the coolant and the dielectric, especially for\nhigh-voltage and high-power transformers. According to the\ncooling mechanism, oil-immersed transformers can be clas-\nsiﬁed either as natural oil cooling (ON), oil forced cool-\ning (OF), or oil directed cooling (OD). ON transformers have\na simple structure and high stability. The lift force of ﬂow is\ngenerated by the density discrepancy of oil at different tem-\nperatures. OF transformers acquire an improvement on the\nconvection coefﬁcients of cooling equipment by increasing\nthe velocity of ﬂow with the help of pumps, while the oil ﬂow\nin the windings is still a thermosiphon ﬂow. To reduce the hot-\nspot temperature, oil is pumped and forced to ﬂow through\nthe horizontal cooling ducts in the windings, and this type of\ntransformer is named OD transformer. However, the increase\nin ﬂow velocity exacerbates the electriﬁcation of oil.\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Fuhui Zhou.\nThe accumulated charges may discharge onto the insula-\ntion board and shorten the transformer service life [1].\nAnother approach to enhance the heat transfer performance\nof oil-immersed transformers is to improve the inherently\nlow thermal conductivity of transformer oil by dispers-\ning solid particles of high thermal conductivity into the\noil. This concept was proposed by Maxwell and realized\nby Eastman et al. [2] for the ﬁrst time using nanoparti-\ncles. The mixture, prepared with base ﬂuids and nanoparti-\ncles, is named nanoﬂuid. Properties of transformer oil-based\nnanoﬂuids with different nanoparticles and concentrations\nhave been measured, which show signiﬁcant improve-\nment in terms of thermal conductivity [3]–[5]. The DC/AC\ndielectric strength of transformer oil-based nanoﬂuids with\nspeciﬁc nanoparticles and volume fractions is enhanced\nsimultaneously [4]–[6].\nAccurate prediction of the hot-spot temperature-rise in\ntransformer windings is crucial for an appropriate ther-\nmal design. The thermal-hydraulic networks are proposed\nto determine the temperature and the ﬂow distribution\nVOLUME 7, 2019\n2169-3536 \n 2019 IEEE.

Zhanget al.: Numerical Study on Natural Convective Heat Transfer of Nanofluids in Disc-Type Transformer Windings\nin oil-immersed transformer windings, in which the heat\nconduction sub-model and the hydraulic sub-model are\ncoupled by the boundary conditions on the solid-liquid inter-\nfaces [7], [8]. Numerical methods, which have the abil-\nity to handle irregular geometry, complex ﬂow ﬁeld and\nmaterial nonlinearity, have also been applied in the thermal\nperformance analysis of oil-immersed transformer wind-\nings [9]–[14]. In order to evaluate the hot-spot temperature-\nrise of windings accurately, both solid parts and coolants\nare considered in the computational domain. This is espe-\ncially critical for ON transformers, in which the heat trans-\nfer is strongly coupled with the oil ﬂow [15]. In numerical\nmethods, such as ﬁnite volume method (FVM), the heat\ntransfer between windings and coolants are solved with-\nout any boundary conditions imposed on the interface.\nTemperature-dependent parameters, such as material prop-\nerties and boundary conditions, are readily embedded in the\nnumerical model [12]. In a word, more detailed and accurate\nsolutions could be derived using numerical methods.\nAccording to the literatures [3], [4], [6], several cate-\ngories of transformer oil-based nanoﬂuids have been pre-\npared and measured. However, there is no numerical analysis\nor experimental study on the temperature and ﬂow distribu-\ntion in nanoﬂuid cooled transformer windings. In the liter-\natures [16]–[19], which numerically analyze the nanoﬂuid\nﬂow in simple containers, two types of models are used to\ncharacterize the nanoﬂuid, and they are, namely, the single-\nphase model and the multi-phase model. As nanoﬂuid con-\nsists of two phases, the solid phase and the liquid phase,\nthe use of multi-phase model is straightforward, and multi-\nphase models, such as the mixture model and the Eulerian\nmodel, are reported to be more precise than the single-phase\nmodel [17]–[19]. In the single-phase model, the nanoﬂuid\nis regarded as a homogenous mixture with equivalent prop-\nerties [20], [21]. In the multi-phase models, interactions\nbetween phases are considered, and the volume fraction dis-\ntribution of phases can be derived along with the ﬁelds. The\nmajor drawback of multi-phase models is more equations are\ninvolved in the governing equations.\nIn this paper, the disc-type windings of a natural nanoﬂuid\n(oil/SiC) cooling transformer are modelled and analyzed\nnumerically. It is the ﬁrst time to implement the mix-\nture model to study such a nanoﬂuid ﬂow ﬁeld, and the\nsingle-phase model is also used for comparison and mutual\nauthentication. The existing results of the referenced wind-\nings cooled by transformer oil [9] are treated as the references\nfor the validation of the numerical model. The evaluation\nfocuses on the changes in temperature proﬁle, mass ﬂow\nrate distribution and pressure drop after using the nanoﬂuid.\nIn order to give a rounded analysis, the effect of volume\nfraction of nanoparticles is taken into consideration.\nII. MATHEMATICAL MODELLING\nOwing to the axisymmetric structure of the windings, two–\ndimensional (2D) model [22] instead of three–dimensional\n(3D) model [10] is employed in the following analysis.\nThe governing equations used to represent the ﬁelds depend\non the pattern of ﬂuid motion and the nanoﬂuid model. In the\nsingle-phase model, the nanoﬂuid is regarded as conventional\nsingle-phase ﬂuid. Nanoﬂuid is modelled integrally using\nthe equivalent properties, and no more additional terms or\nequations are required for the dispersed nanoparticles. These\nmulti-phase models, such as the mixture model, take these\nterms and equations into account. Moreover, the nanoﬂuid\nﬂow in the ON transformer windings is laminar, since the\nvelocities are quite low. Hence no turbulence model is needed.\nThe problem of continuous ﬁelds is then discretized and\nsolved with numerical methods and the mesh ﬁle of the\ncomputational domain. In this paper, the FVM based software\npackage Ansys-FLUENT is adopted to solve the convective\nheat transfer problem.\nFIGURE 1. The configuration of one pass of the low-voltage windings.\nA. GEOMETRY AND BOUNDARY CONDITIONS\nThe low-voltage windings of an ON power transformer rated\nat 66MV A [9], in which the regular transformer oil is replaced\nby nanoﬂuid (oil/SiC), are modiﬁed and modelled to evaluate\nthe performance of nanoﬂuid. An axisymmetric 2D model\nis built for one pass of the low-voltage windings, as shown\nin Fig. 1. This pass contains two vertical ducts, twenty hor-\nizontal ducts and nineteen discs, and the horizontal ducts\nand the discs are sequentially numbered according to the\nX-axis direction, respectively. The insulation paper around\nthe conductors is also taken into consideration in the model.\nThe notations in Fig. 1 have the following dimensions:\nLdisc =0.0522(m)\nRw =0.3162(m)\n51268 VOLUME 7, 2019\nY. Zhanget al.: Numerical Study on Natural Convective Heat Transfer of Nanofluids in Disc-Type Transformer Windings\nHduct =0.0051(m)\nHdisc =0.015(m)\nLo =0.0064(m)\nLi =0.0089(m)\nHip =0.0004(m)\nLip =0.0008(m)\nLc =0.0021(m)\nHc =0.0143(m)\nAs Fig. 1 shows, oil ﬂows into this pass from the outer vertical\nduct, through the horizontal ducts and out of this pass from the\ninner vertical duct. The oil that ﬂows in the horizontal ducts\nof the subsequent pass is exactly in the opposite direction of\nthat in this pass. These two types of passes with opposite inlet\npositions constitute the zig-zag cooling system of windings.\nTherefore, the pass with inlet on the inner vertical duct is also\nincluded in the following analysis.\nThe conductors are imposed on homogeneous heat sources\n(676.9W /disc), which are conducted to the solid-liquid inter-\nface and dissipated to the coolants through convection. These\ntwo oil washers and the surrounding cylinders with low\nthermal conductivity are considered as adiabatic. The inlet\nboundary condition derived by heat run test is an isothermal\nﬂow (Tinlet =319.85K) with the velocity of 0.0592 m/s, and\nthe outlet is set with a pressure boundary condition (0 Pa).\nThis inlet boundary condition applies to the transformer\noil cooling and the nanoﬂuid cooling, and the inﬂuence of\nnanoﬂuid on the inlet ﬂow is neglected to isolate the effect\nthat nanoﬂuid has on the convective heat transfer inside the\nwindings.\nTABLE 1. Material properties.\nB. MATERIAL PROPERTIES\nThe properties of SiC nanoparticle with the diameter\nof 100nm are listed in Table 1 along with the properties of\ncopper and insulation paper. All these properties are con-\nsidered as temperature independent, while the properties of\ntransformer oil vary with temperature as follows [12]:\nρf =1098.72 −0.712T (1)\nCf =807.163 +3.58T (2)\nµf =0.08467 −4.0×10−4T +5.0×10−7T 2 (3)\nkf =0.1509 −7.101×10−5T (4)\nwhere; ρ, C, µ, and k are density, speciﬁc heat, viscosity\nand thermal conductivity, respectively; the transformer oil is\nindexed by the subscript f .\nC. THE SINGLE-PHASE MODEL\nIn the single-phase model of nanoﬂuid [16]–[21], it is\nassumed that the nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed in\nthe base ﬂuid. Moreover, the velocity discrepancy and inter-\nactions between phases are neglected. The properties of\nnanoﬂuid are represented by equivalent models which are\naffected by multiple variables, such as the species, the dimen-\nsion and the volume fraction of nanoparticles. The formulas\nfor the density and the speciﬁc heat of nanoﬂuid is relatively\nstraightforward, as given by\nρnf =(1 −∅)ρf +∅ρp (5)\nCnf ρnf =(1 −∅)Cf ρf +∅C pρp (6)\nwhere; ∅ is the volume fraction of nanoparticles; the\nnanoﬂuid and the nanoparticle are noted by the subscript\nnf and p, respectively. However, for the viscosity and the\nthermal conductivity, a uniform model working for all types\nof nanoﬂuids does not exist. In this paper, the Einstein viscos-\nity formula based model [23] which considers the dimension\nof the nanoparticle is used to predict the nanoﬂuid viscosity\nand the thermal conductivity model [24] derived by ﬁtting\nexperimental data is adopted\nµnf =µf\n[\n1 +2.5∅\n(\n1 +8.868\nr\n)]\n(7)\nknf =kf\n[\n1 +4.4Re0.4\np Pr0.66\nf\n( T\nTfr\n)10 (kp\nkf\n)0.03\n∅0.66\n]\n(8)\nwhere; r is the average radius of the nanoparticle; Pr is the\nPrandtl number; Tfr is the freezing point of the base liquid;\nthe Reynolds number of nanoparticle is deﬁned as\nRep =2ρf kbT\nπµ2\nf dp\n(9)\nwhere; kb is the Boltzmann constant (1.38066×10 −23JK−1);\ndp is the diameter of the nanoparticle. It is worth noting\nthat the viscosity and the thermal conductivity of nanoﬂu-\nids increase with the rising volume fraction. It can be seen\nfrom (8) and (9) that the inﬂuence of temperature on the\nthermal conductivity is considered in the model, while the\ninteraction between phases is assumed to be temperature\nindependent in other three models.\nThe Reynolds number for the nanoﬂuid ﬂow in the wind-\nings is calculated to determine the ﬂow pattern. The average\nvelocity is replaced by the inlet velocity which is relatively\nlarge, and the calculated Reynolds numbers (<1000) for all\nthe ﬂows in this study are much smaller than the critical\nReynolds number of turbulence (2100). Therefore, the stud-\nied nanoﬂuid ﬂows are all laminar. The governing equations\nfor laminar nanoﬂuid ﬂow represented by the single-phase\nmodel are identical to that of conventional single-phase ﬂow,\nas given by\nContinuity,\n∇·\n(\nρnf V\n)\n=0 (10)\nVOLUME 7, 2019 51269\nY.

THE MIXTURE MODEL\nLike the single-phase model, the governing equations of\ncontinuity, momentum and energy in the mixture model are\nformulated for the mixture rather than for each phase, while\nthe velocity difference and the interaction between phases are\nconsidered in the momentum and energy equations [18], [19].\nMoreover, one more equation for the volume fraction of\nnanoparticles is included in the governing equations, which\nare given by\nContinuity,\n∇·\n(\nρnf Vm\n)\n=0 (13)\nMomentum,\n∇·\n(\nρnf VmVm\n)\n=−∇P +∇· τ+ρnf g\n+∇·\n(∑2\nk=1 ∅k ρk Vdr,k Vdr,k\n)\n(14)\nEnergy and,\n∇·\n(∑2\nk=1 ∅k Vk (ρk Ek +P)\n)\n=∇·\n(\nknf ∇T\n)\n+Se (15)\nV olume fraction,\n∇·\n(\n∅ρpVm\n)\n=∇·\n(\n∅ρpVdr,p\n)\n(16)\nVm is the mass-averaged velocity of the nanoﬂuid\nVm =\n∑2\nk=1 ∅k ρk Vk\nρnf\n(17)\nThe stress tensor τ is deﬁned as:\nτ =µnf ∇Vm (18)\nThe drift velocity Vdr,p is connected to the relative velocity\nVpf by the following formula:\nVdr,p =Vpf −\n∑2\nk=1\n∅k ρk\nρnf\nVfk (19)\nAn algebraic formulation for the relative velocity [25], which\nis based on the assumption of a local equilibrium between\nphases over a short length scale, is adopted\nVpf =\nρpd2\np\n18µf fdrag\n(\nρp −ρeff\n)\nρp\na (20)\nwhere a is the acceleration,\na =g −(Vm ·∇)Vm (21)\nand the drag force function fdrag is proposed by [26]\nfdrag =\n{\n1 +0.15Re0.687\np Rep ≤1000\n0.0183Rep Rep >1000 (22)\nIn the mixture model, the governing equations, which\ninclude the continuity equation of the mixture, the momentum\nequation of the mixture, the energy equation of the mixture,\nthe volume fraction equation of the secondary phase, and the\nalgebraic expressions of the relative velocities, are solved.\nAs a consequence, the number of variables in the mixture\nmodel is larger than the single-phase model and smaller than\nthe full multiphase model.\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nA. MODEL VALIDATION AND GRID-INDEPENDENCE\nSTUDY\nBoth the transformer oil ﬂow and the nanoﬂuid ﬂow are\nsolved with the pressure-based steady-state solver in a cou-\npled manner. To validate the accuracy of the numerical model\nand the solver, the referenced wingding [9] is recalculated\nﬁrstly, solutions of which are compared with the existing\nresults in [9]. As shown in Fig. 2(a), the same hot-spot loca-\ntion (disc 16) with the temperature of 365.04K is derived, and\nthe error of this maximum temperature is about 0.9% (3.5K).\nIn addition, the results of mass ﬂow rate fraction obtained in\nthis paper, which are given in Fig. 2(b), are in good agreement\nwith those given in [9]. Consistent with the reference, the ﬁrst\nduct has the largest mass ﬂow rate fraction, which is located in\nthe interval (18%, 19%), and the mass ﬂow rate fraction of the\nlast duct is relatively small, about 3%. Hence the correctness\nof the numerical model and the solver is validated.\nFIGURE 2. (a) The temperature contours and (b) the flow distribution of\nthe referenced winding.\nThese two modiﬁed passes with transformer oil cooling are\nsolved with the validated solver, and the results are treated\nas the references for the nanoﬂuid cooling to estimate the\nheat transfer performance. The contours of the temperature\nof these two passes with opposite inlet positions are given\nin Fig. 3. With more coolant ﬂowing into the later pass shown\nin Fig. 3(b), its hot-spot temperature is much lower than\nthat of the former pass. There are approximately 1.2 million\n51270 VOLUME 7, 2019\nY.

The mass ﬂow rate distribution in the\nhorizontal ducts is obtained and shown in Fig. 4. It is worth\nnoting that the pass with inlet on the inner vertical duct has\na relatively uniform mass ﬂow rate distribution, leading to a\nsmaller temperature discrepancy among the discs. Discs sur-\nrounded by ducts with the smallest mass ﬂow rate distribution\n(MFRD), which is deﬁned as\nMFRDi = Mi\n(∑20\nk=1 Mk\n)\n/20\n= Mi\nMmean\n(23)\nrather than the top discs, have the highest temperature-rise\n(see Fig. 4). The hot-spot locations of these two passes are\ndisc fourteen and disc ﬁfteen, respectively.\nMesh generated in the analysis of transformer oil cooling\nis used in the study of oil/SiC nanoﬂuid (1% volume fraction\nof nanoparticles) cooling, and reﬁned meshes with more ele-\nments are introduced to ensure the grid-independence of the\nresults. For ﬂows in simple geometries, a general reference\nfor the grid-independence is the variation in the average Nus-\nselt number [27]. Since the pass geometry is complicated, it is\ndifﬁcult to determine the characteristic length, the heat ﬂux\nand the temperature difference for the whole system. Another\nalternative for grid-independence validation is to compare the\nmaximum and mean temperature variation [9]. Two reﬁned\nmeshes with about 8% and 16% more elements are generated\nby constraining the element sizing globally. The maximum\ntemperature and average temperature changes are less than\n0.2% (0.59K) and 0.3% (0.97K) when using the single-phase\nmodel, and the corresponding changes for the mixture model\nare 0.4% (1.39K) and 0.3% (0.85K), respectively. Then the\ninitial mesh is feasible for this speciﬁc problem.\nB. COMPARISON BETWEEN THE NANOFLUID COOLING\nAND THE TRANSFORMER OIL COOLING\nFor a convection ﬂow, the heat transfer coefﬁcient on the\nsolid-liquid interface increases with the improvement of the\nthermal conductivity of coolants. Hence the same amount of\nheat could be dissipated to the ambient coolants with a rela-\ntively small temperature difference. In addition to the thermal\nconductivity, the viscosity of transformer oil is increased by\nadding nanoparticles. In the following analysis, the trans-\nformer oil is replaced by the oil/SiC nanoﬂuid (1% volume\nfraction of nanoparticles), and the numerical results of trans-\nformer oil cooling are used as the references for nanoﬂuid\ncooling.\nThe mixture model is implemented to study the nanoﬂuid\nﬂow in the windings, and the single-phase model is also used\nfor comparison and mutual authentication. The pass with inlet\non the outer vertical duct is calculated ﬁrstly, and an overall\nreduction in temperature is observed through comparing the\nresults with the references, as shown in Fig. 5(a) and Fig. 6(b).\nThe maximum temperature-rise reduction in Fig. 5(a), which\nis calculated for each disc, is deﬁned as follows:\np1 =T max\nf −T max\nnf (24)\nIt can be found that the peak locations in Fig. 5(a) are almost\ncoincident with the peak location of the transformer oil cool-\ning temperature proﬁle, which is shown in Fig. 4. The results\nof relative mass ﬂow rate increment, which is calculated for\neach duct and deﬁned by\np2 =\nMFRDnf −MFRDf\nMFRDf\n(25)\nexplain and conﬁrm the variation on maximum temperature-\nrise of each disc (see Fig. 5(b)). Moreover, the heat transfer\ncoefﬁcient of disc is increased in a similar manner to the\ncurve given in Fig. 5(a). It is worth noting that these two\nmodels give quite close results for the thermal and ﬂuidic\nﬁeld in the windings, which strengthens the effectiveness of\nthe numerical analysis by mutual authentication.\nThe detailed results of the mass ﬂow rate distribution of\nthis pass are listed in Table 2 for a clear illustration.

Mass flow rate distribution.\nof the higher relative mass ﬂow rate increment as shown\nin Fig. 5(b). There is a maximum difference of 1.7% in\nthe heat transfer coefﬁcient of disc between these two mod-\nels. Owing to the great density of dispersed nanoparticles,\nthe density of nanoﬂuid is higher than that of transformer\noil. The velocity of ﬂow, which is another variable involved\nin the drag equation, decreases slightly after the addition\nof nanoparticles. Under the combined effect of increasing\ndensity and decreasing velocity, the pressure drop in this pass,\nwhich is deﬁned as the difference between the mass ﬂow\naveraged pressures at the inlet and outlet, is reduced slightly\nwhen using this nanoﬂuid, as shown in Fig. 7.\nFIGURE 7. Pressure drop as a function of volume fraction.\nAs introduced before, the equation for the volume fraction\nof nanoparticles is included in the mixture model, and the\nresults for the pass with inlet on the outer vertical duct is\n51272 VOLUME 7, 2019\nY. Zhanget al.: Numerical Study on Natural Convective Heat Transfer of Nanofluids in Disc-Type Transformer Windings\nshown in Fig. 6(a). Overall, the concentration of nanoparticle\nis inversely proportional to the temperature of nanoﬂuid. For\nnanoﬂuid in the horizontal ducts, the inside temperature is\nmuch higher than the outside temperature. Hence these hori-\nzontal ducts witness an upward trend in the volume fraction\nfrom the inside of ducts to the outside of ducts, which is\nopposite to the trend in temperature change.\nThe nanoﬂuid ﬂow in the pass with inlet on the inner\nvertical duct is calculated and compared to the reference. It is\nfound that the inﬂuence of nanoﬂuid on the mass ﬂow rate\ndistribution is relatively small, as shown in Fig. 8(b). Even\nso, a more pronounced effect is derived with the single-phase\nmodel. The improvement on heat transfer is mainly achieved\nby the increased thermal conductivity, hence the thermal\nﬁeld results obtained by these two models, which are given\nin Fig. 8(a), are roughly consistent. Comparing the results of\nthese two models, the maximum difference in the heat transfer\ncoefﬁcient of disc is less than 0.2%. With a weak effect\non the ﬂow ﬁeld and a signiﬁcant increase in the density,\nthe pressure drop in this pass increases slightly after using\nthe nanoﬂuid, as shown in Fig. 7.\nFIGURE 8. (a) Maximum temperature-rise reduction and (b) relative mass\nflow rate increment for the pass with inlet on the inner vertical duct and\nnanofluid cooling.\nDespite the varying effects that nanoﬂuids have on the ﬂow\nﬁelds, the improvement in thermal conductivity produces\ndistinct temperature drops over the entire pass. Moreover,\nit is concluded from the results of these two passes that the\nheat transfer performance can be further improved by the\nadjusted mass ﬂow rate distribution. The effectiveness of the\nnumerical analysis is strengthened by the mutual authentica-\ntion of these two models. Since the mixture model is reported\nto be more precise than the single-phase model [18], [19],\nthe mixture model is adopted in the following analysis of\nvolume fraction.\nC. EFFECT OF THE VOLUME FRACTION\nThe impact that the volume fraction of nanoparticles has on\nthe heat transfer in the windings is measured by considering\nfour more nanoﬂuids with the volume fraction of 1.5%, 2%,\n2.5%, and 3%. The calculated results for these two passes\nare given in Fig. 9 and Fig. 10, respectively. The numerical\nresults obtained in the former section are also included in\nthese ﬁgures for comparison. It is worth noting that the\noverall tendency of these two parameters (p 1 and p2) along\nthe ﬂow direction is maintained, while the effect of nanoﬂuid\nis enhanced with the rising volume fraction. Hence there is a\npositive correlation between the volume fraction and the heat\ntransfer performance. However, the pressure drops in these\ntwo passes grow as well, as shown in Fig. 7, especially for\nthe pass with inlet on the inner vertical duct. More powerful\npumps are required to compensate the increasing pressure\nFIGURE 9. (a) Maximum temperature-rise reduction and (b) relative mass\nflow rate increment as a function of volume fraction for the pass with\ninlet on the outer vertical duct.\nVOLUME 7, 2019 51273\nY. Zhanget al.: Numerical Study on Natural Convective Heat Transfer of Nanofluids in Disc-Type Transformer Windings\nFIGURE 10.

All these observed variations are\ncorrelated with the properties of nanoﬂuids, which are deter-\nmined by the volume fraction of the nanoparticles. To cope\nwith these mentioned factors and the cost, optimization algo-\nrithms may be used to ﬁnd the Pareto front for practical\napplication, and the ﬂexibility of nanoﬂuids makes it possible\nto prepare the coolants as required.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, the heat transfer in disc-type transformer\nwindings cooled by natural oil/SiC nanoﬂuid is investigated\nnumerically. Although nanoﬂuids have different effects on\nthe ﬂow ﬁelds, distinct temperature drops can be observed\nin these two passes after using the nanoﬂuid. The pass with\ninlet on the outer vertical duct also witnesses a signiﬁcant\nimprovement in the mass ﬂow rate distribution, which further\nimproves the heat transfer performance of the nanoﬂuid. Both\nthe mixture model and the single-phase model are adopted in\nthe analysis, and the effectiveness of the numerical analysis is\nstrengthened by the mutual authentication of these two mod-\nels. When increasing the volume fraction of nanoparticles, the\nnanoﬂuids produce enhanced effects on the heat transfer and\nthe ﬂow ﬁeld, which is accompanied by an increase in the\npressure drop.\nREFERENCES\n[1] R.
