Sin embargo, se considera la nece-\nsidad de crear o validar otros instrumentos internacionales \npara suplir las necesidades existentes.\nPalabras clave: calidad de vida; niño; cuestionarios.\nIntroduction\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) defined quality of \nlife as “the individual’s perception of his/her position in life in \nthe context of culture and value systems in which he/she lives \nand in relation to his/her goals, expectations, standards, and \nconcerns”(1). This definition emphasizes the multidimensional \nnature of quality of life that encompasses different aspects, \nincluding physical, functional, besides psychological and \nsocial well-being(2,3). There is a growing recognition that the \nquality of life refers to something much broader than health(4). \nThe evaluation of quality of life requires that health profession-\nals not only evaluate biological issues related to the disease, but \nalso consider a psychosocial approach. Consequently, in 1990, \nit was consolidated the idea that instruments measuring qual-\nity of life should consider the perspective of the people and \nnot be restricted to the perspective of health professionals and \nresearchers(5). Previous studies aimed at evaluating quality of \nlife were mostly focused on adults or the elderly(6,7), stressing, \nhowever, the need for assessing the quality of life in children(8,9).\nThe evaluation of quality of life in children was initially \nheld through the perception of parents, considering that \nchildren were unable to perform this task. However, further \nclarification allowed verifying the ability of this population \nto assess and understand issues related to their lives(10), even \nthough parents may have a different perception of their chil-\ndren(11). Therefore, the inclusion of children as subjects of \nresearch depends on their ability, respecting their limits in the \ncomplex process related to quality of life and health. It should \nalso be taken into consideration the skill and creativity of the \nresearcher to adapt instruments that become interesting and \nmobilize children to socialize their experiences(12). Thus, some \ninstruments have been developed with the purpose and pos-\nsibility of being used to assess quality of life in children(13-15).\nIn this context, the aim of this study was to review the lit-\nerature about instruments validated to Portuguese and to the \nBrazilian culture in order to assess quality of life in children. \nWe researched scientific articles on the Medline, Lilacs, and \nSciELO databases, using the combination of descriptors \n“quality of life,” “child,” and “questionnaires,” in English and \nPortuguese. After the combination of the descriptors and the \napplication of existing filters in databases, such as studies on \nchildren, validation studies, and studies conducted in Brazil, \n637 scientific studies were found. From reading the abstracts, \nwe excluded studies that did not address the validation of \ninstruments and that aimed to evaluate the quality of life \nrelated to a specific health condition or disease. Therefore, \nwe included four studies that validated generic quality of life \ninstruments in children for the Portuguese and Brazilian cul-\nture. The literature search was not limited to a specific period. \nQuality of life Instruments\nQuestionnaires are instruments that are widely used for \nscientific research and may be useful, among other things, to \nestimate the need for treatment, investigate the determinants \nof the health-disease process, evaluate health service(16), and \nquality of life. The creation of instruments to assess quality \nof life that are psychometrically valid presents consider -\nable difficulty due to their subjective characteristics, being \ninfluenced by cultural and temporal aspects. Furthermore, \nit should be considered the multidimensional characteristic \nof quality of life, that relates to the environment on aspects \nsuch as physical, psychological, social relations, and personal \nbeliefs, taking into account that the object of evaluation is \nthe perception of the respondent/patient(17).\n274\nTools used for evaluation of Brazilian children’s quality of life\nRev Paul Pediatr 2014;32(2):272-8.\nIn general, indicators of quality of life are associated with health \nconditions, being mostly built as questionnaires made of items that \nseek to measure - through organized response in the form of numeri-\ncal scales - how aspects of people’s lives are affected by poor health. \nHowever, it is emphasized that the quality of life is a construct, \nwhich cannot be fully operationalized and directly measured, i.e., \nthe numerical measures are considered imperfect indexes(5).\nThe interest in the use, creation, and validation of tools for \nquality of life in the field of child health has gradually developed \nin the Brazilian scientific community. This may result from \ndiscussions about the importance of the inclusion of instru-\nments dealing with the assessment of quality of life in routine \nhealth care services. Nevertheless, we observed a shortage of \nnational instruments, which appears to reflect the difficulty of \nthe scientific community to develop tools for assessing quality \nof life that apply to the socio-cultural diversity of the country(12).\nOver the years, instruments were created to assess quality of life, \nsuch as the WHO Instrument for Assessment of Quality of Life \n(WHOQOL-100)(18) and the 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey \n(SF-12)(19). To further specify the assessment of quality of life, in-\nstruments were developed for specific population groups such as \nchildren. Among the instruments specifically designed to assess \nthe quality of life of children, validated for the Brazilian language \nand culture, we highlight the Autoquestionnaire Qualité de Vie En-\nfant Imagé (AUQEI)(13), the Child Health Questionnaire – Parent \nForm 50 (CHQ–PF50)(14), the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory \n(PedsQL™) version 4.0(15) and the Kidscreen-52(20), which are the \ninstruments considered in the present review (Chart 1).\n*Gratuity depends on the purpose for which the instrument is used.

Souza et al\nRev Paul Pediatr 2014;32(2):272-8.\nAutoquestionnaire Qualité de Vie Enfant Imagé\nThe AUQEI instrument is a quality of life scale developed \nby Manificat et al(21), translated and validated into Brazilian \nculture and language in children from 4 to 12 years old(13). \nThis instrument is intended to assess the subjective feeling of \nwell-being, assuming that the individuals under development \nare and have always been able to express themselves about \ntheir subjectivity. The questionnaire contains 26 questions \ncovering the domains: autonomy, leisure, and family roles. \nTo facilitate the application and understanding, the question-\nnaire uses pictures of faces expressing different emotional \nstates (very unhappy, unhappy, happy, very happy), and the \nchild himself/herself answers each question by choosing one \nof four answer options. Therefore, without a time limit, the \nchild indicates the answer (face) that best matches his/her feel-\ning against the proposed domain. Prior to the application of \nthe questions, the child is asked to express his/her feelings to \neach of the response options. For example, for the answer that \nrepresents “very happy,” the child is induced to remember a \nprevious situation in which he/she had such feeling, in order \nto better understand the response options(13).\nTo validate this tool for Brazilian language, we assessed \n353 schoolchildren aged 4-12 years in the municipality of \nSão Paulo, state of São Paulo, establishing a cutoff of 48 \nfor the general population; values below this score were \nconsidered unsatisfactory quality of life. The study had in-\nternal validity, with Cronbach coefficient of 0.71, indicating \nadequate reliability of the instrument(13).\nThe AUQEI has been widely used in studies that seek to \nevaluate the quality of life in healthy children and in children \nwith some illness. One study showed similar quality-of-life \nindexes in 20 children aged 4-12 years old with autism, \ncompared to 20 normal children matched for sex and age(22).\nBarreire et al(23) evaluated the quality of life of 20 ostomized \nchildren attending a public reference service in São Paulo. In this \nstudy, we used the AUQEI questionnaire translated and adapted \nto Brazilian culture, applied to children and their mothers, \nobtaining, respectively, total mean scores of 51.95±7.90 and \n49.60±5.60, which corresponded to the satisfactory quality of \nlife in the perception of mothers and children(23).\nThe AUQEI is easy to administer, has a relatively low \nnumber of questions, is self-administered, and without time \nlimit, since children need to reflect on their feelings for each \ndomain(13). This questionnaire has low complexity because \nit uses faces that express feelings, being, therefore, easy to \nunderstand for children. \nTo purchase the instrument in its entirety, one should \naccess the study of Assumpção et al(13), who conducted its \nvalidation for Brazil and presented the complete instrument \nin their study. We emphasize the importance of respecting \nthe copyrights of the work, properly citing the authors who \ndeveloped and validated the instrument.\nChild Health Questionnaire – Parent Form 50\nThe CHQ–PF50 is a generic instrument that assesses \nhealth-related quality of life in children(24), which was adapt-\ned for the Brazilian culture by Machado et al(14) in children \nwith juvenile idiopathic arthritis and in healthy children, \nobtaining a Cronbach’s coefficient of 0.7.\nThe CHQ–PF50 questionnaire consists of 50 questions \ndesigned to assess the physical and psychosocial well-being \nof children and adolescents aged from 5 to 18 years, and \nwas responded by parents or guardians. The construct has \n15 fields, each with a score on a scale of zero to 100; the \nhigher the score, the better the state of health, satisfaction, \nand well-being. Among these domains, ten are aggregated \ninto two indexes, the physical and psychosocial scores with \na score from zero to 50 for each score. The ten aggregated \ndomains are: physical functioning, social role of the limi -\ntation of daily activities due to emotional and behavioral \naspects, social role of the limitation of daily activities due to \nphysical capacity, body pain or discomfort, behavior, mental \nhealth, self-esteem, perceptions of health, emotional impact \non the family, and impact on parents’ time. The other five \ndomains are: overall health assessment, global assessment \nof behavior, change in health status, family activities, and \nfamily cohesion(25,26).\nThe questionnaire is self-administered to parents or \nguardians, who were instructed to base their information \non the experiences lived by the child in the past four weeks, \nexcept in the scale on the overall health status, which refers \nto the last 12 months. To calculate each score, at least 50% \nof items answered in each scale are required(26).\nFaleiros and Machado (25), in a study to assess health-\nrelated quality of life in 100 children with functional \ndefecation disorders, used the CHQ-PF50, comparing \ntheir results with those of healthy children from a previous \nstudy that validated the instrument for Brazilian culture. \nIn this study, the authors showed that the values   of the \nphysical and psychosocial scores, as well as other areas \nof the instrument, were lower in children with disorders \ncompared to healthy children.\n276\nTools used for evaluation of Brazilian children’s quality of life\nRev Paul Pediatr 2014;32(2):272-8.\nA study used the CHQ–PF50 to assess the impact of al-\nlergic rhinitis on health-related quality of life in children and \nadolescents. The questionnaire was completed by parents or \ncaregivers of 23 children and adolescents and showed that \nthe scores obtained by the patients were lower ( p<0.05) \nthan those from the healthy control group in physical and \npsychosocial indexes and in most areas, showing that allergic \nrhinitis appears to negatively impact on quality of life(27). \nThe CHQ–PF50 has a relatively large number of questions \n(50 questions), which may require a long time for applica-\ntion. On the other hand, it is a self-administered instrument \nto parents, facilitating its use. A previous study highlighted \nthe ease in implementation, considering the clarity of the \nversion translated into Portuguese(25). \nMore information about the instrument and which lan -\nguages   it has been translated to, as well as one of its ver -\nsions in full can be obtained on the website HealthActCHQ \n(http://www.healthact.com/chq.php). It is noteworthy that \nsome studies, such as the one by Morales(26), present the full \nversion of the instrument in Portuguese, as well as guidelines \nfor its application and analysis.\nPediatric Quality of Life Inventory version 4.0\nThe PedsQL™ was developed to measure the health-related \nquality of life in children and adolescents from 5 to 18 years and \na questionnaire for parents of children and adolescents between \n2 and 18 years old, and it can be used in patients with chronic \nhealth disorders or in healthy children and adolescents(28). \nThis instrument was translated and validated for the Bra-\nzilian culture(15) and has 23 items that address the following \ndimensions: physical (eight items), emotional (five items), \nsocial (five items), and school (five items), which are developed \nfrom discussion groups, cognitive interviews, and pretests(29). \nThe assessment of children includes the following age groups: \n5–7, 8–12, and 13–18 years. The questionnaire of the parents \nincludes age groups from 2–4 years (preschooler), 5–7 (young \nchild), 8–12 (child), and 13–18 years (adolescent). The items \nfor each of the questionnaires are similar, differing in language, \nthat is appropriate to the level of development and the use \nof first or third person(15). For its application, approximately \nfive minutes are needed(29). The questions ask the individual \nhow much each item represented a problem in the last month, \nwith a range of responses from five options (0 – it is never a \nproblem; 1 – it is hardly ever a problem; 2 – it is occasionally \na problem; 3 – it is often a problem; 4 – it is almost always a \nproblem). Negative questions are scored inversely in a scale \nfrom 0–100 to (0–100; 1–75; 2–50; 3–25; 4–0); thus, the \nhigher the score, the better the quality of life. The scores of \nthe dimensions can be computed as the sum of the items \ndivided by the number of items answered and, if more than \n50% of the items of the dimensions are missing, the score is \nnot computed(15).\nThe use of the PedsQL was demonstrated in a previous \nstudy that aimed to evaluate the quality of life of 50 obese \nchildren compared to 81 normal weight, aged 8–12 years, \nshowing that obese children had lower quality of life in \nall four areas compared to normal weight children, with \na significant difference in the physical, emotional, social, \npsychosocial, and general quality of life domains. The me -\ndian overall quality of life of obese children was 69.9, while \nthat of normal weight was 82.2 on a scale of 100 points(30).\nKlatchoian et al (31) investigated the impact of demo -\ngraphic, social, economic, and family quality of life of 240 \nschool children between 2 and 18 years old from São Paulo, \nwith the PedsQL applied orally. The authors found satisfac-\ntory quality-of-life scores between the investigated schools \ncompared to other populations of urban children. Further-\nmore, there was significant difference in emotional, social, \nand psychosocial aspects, and in the total score, with higher \nscores in children from social classes A + B, followed by the \nclass C and the D + E, in all situations.\nAn advantage of the PedsQL is presenting two versions, \none for parents and one for children and adolescents (15), \nwhich allows greater use according to the characteristics of \nthe study to be performed. Originally, the tool was proposed \nto be self-administered(28), but the validation study for the \nBrazilian culture demonstrated the ability to be administered \nby the interviewer(15). We also emphasize that the application \nof the instrument was considered fast and easy as well as the \ncalculation of summary scores and scales(15). \nMore information about the PedsQL, such as versions in \nfull and copyrights may be obtained from the PedsQL™ \nwebsite – Measurement Model for the Pediatric Quality \nof Life Inventory™ (http://www.pedsql.org/about_pedsql.\nhtml). Versions of the instrument and permission for use \nmay be requested from the Mapi Research Trust (http://\nwww.mapi-trust.org/). \nKidscreen-52\nKidscreen-52 was developed in Europe(32) and validated in \nBrazil(20) to assess and monitor the quality of life in children \nand adolescents.w\n277\nJoão Gabriel S. Souza et al\nRev Paul Pediatr 2014;32(2):272-8.\nThe instrument has 52 questions divided in the fol -\nlowing dimensions: health and physical activity, feelings, \nemotional state, self-awareness, autonomy and free time, \nfamily/home environment, financial aspect, friends and \nsocial support, school environment, and teasing/bullying. \nThis questionnaire provides practical steps for clinicians \nand researchers to assess the well-being and the subjective \nhealth of both healthy children and adolescents and indi -\nviduals with chronic disease. The answers of the questions \nare distributed on a Likert scale of one to five points and \nrefer to events that occurred in the week previous to the \ninterview. It is also noteworthy the possibility of estimating \nthe overall quality of life of the instrument. It is notable \nthat the questionnaire has a version for parents/guardians, \nevaluating the same components of the version for children/\nteenagers(20). Translation and validation of this instrument \nto Brazil occurred in a sample of 758 students of both sexes \nand 653 parents/guardians, obtaining satisfactory Cronbach \nvalues   between 0.725 and 0.894(20).\nThis instrument is self-administered and can take \n30 minutes on average(20). The full version can be found in \nthe study by Guedes and Guedes (20), who conducted their \nvalidation in Brazil.\nGeneral Comments\nThe questionnaires developed to measure the quality of \nlife of children should be answered by themselves, because \nthey have the right to express their opinions and to have them \nrespected(5). However, when very young, children may have \ntrouble understanding the instrument. Furthermore, some \nmay be disabled, presenting difficulty to provide information \non their quality of life, being necessary that the questionnaire \nbe answered by parents or guardians(5). It is noteworthy that \nthe PedsQL and the Kidscreen-52 have versions for children \nand another for parents or guardians, allowing the choice \naccording to the design and the sample to be investigated.\nAs for the time spent to administer the questionnaire, \nit is believed that the smaller the number of questions, the \nshorter time may be required. However, the low number \nof questions does not mean that the instrument is easy to \nunderstand. Among those presented in this study, PedsQL \nand AUQEI have fewer questions. It is noteworthy that the \nAUQEI has a response system in the form of drawings that \nexpress feelings(13), which may facilitate their understanding. \nThe four instruments are self-administered, but the PedsQL \ncan be administered by the interviewer(15).\nThe validation process of some of the presented instru -\nments was performed on specific samples chosen by re -\nsearchers. However, due to the multicultural characteristics \nof Brazil, it is likely that specific cultural traits influence \nthe understanding of some item of the questionnaire (20). \nIt is noteworthy that due to the low socioeconomic status \nof specific groups, the instruments may require adjustment \nin its application(15).\nThe health-related indicators of quality of life assess the \nquality of life related to health conditions, emphasizing \nfunctional disorders and disabilities that can affect people(33). \nIn this context, instruments were also created to evaluate \nthe quality of life related to the specific conditions of health \nand disease, such as, for instance, oral health (34), asthma(35) \nand HIV(36), which were not presented because they were \noutside the scope of this review.\nIt becomes evident that the use of the instruments dis -\ncussed in this study should be done cautiously, respecting \nthe copyrights. In general, validation studies, as well as \nthose that originated the instruments do not have clear \ninformation regarding copyrights. However, it is extremely \nimportant to reference and cite properly the people respon-\nsible for the creation and validation of instruments. We also \nemphasize that some instruments do not include all child-\nhood age groups; Furthermore, due to the cultural diversity \nof Brazil, some adjustments to the instruments or even the \nvalidation of new instruments on these cultural specificities \nseem to be necessary. We also highlight the importance of \nsome extremely important domains in the current context \nof childhood, such as bullying, which was present only in \nthe Kidscreen- 52(20).\nConclusions\nThe evaluation of quality of life is essential due to its mul-\ntidimensional character, encompassing social, psychological, \nand health issues of individuals. Therefore, among the age \ngroups to be evaluated, the children stand out. The instru-\nments described in this study assess the child’s own percep-\ntion of his/her quality of life, although some are also applied \nto parents. There have been a growing number of studies \nthat seek to assess children’s quality of life. Nevertheless, \ndue to the cultural diversity of Brazil, besides the fact that \nsome instruments do not include all childhood age groups \nor do not have the domains that are currently relevant, such \nas bullying, we recommend the creation or validation of new \ninstruments to be widely used in the country. \n278\nTools used for evaluation of Brazilian children’s quality of life\nRev Paul Pediatr 2014;32(2):272-8.\nReferences\n1.
