    "abstract": "This study explores the integration and application of Design Thinking and Large Language Models (LLMs) in fintech product innovation design from the perspective of requirements management. Design thinking is human-centered, focusing on discovering and solving problems, integrating innovative solutions, and enhancing product value. By understanding and generating natural language, LLMs provide “on-demand” intelligent services through information retrieval, content creation, and human-like dialogue, meeting individualized needs. Through literature review and analysis, this paper reveals that the combination of the two can promote the full intelligence and continuous improvement of the innovation design process, enhancing the R&amp;D efficiency and user experience of fintech products. This research aims to provide innovation design methods for the fintech field and promote its continuous innovation and development.",
