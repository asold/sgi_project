  "full_text": "Innumerable studies have compared humans’ and chim-\npanzees’ genetics, physiology, tool use, social behavior, \nlanguage, and understanding of various facets of their \nworlds. One area that has garnered attention recently \nis chimpanzees’ and people’ s folk physics , defined as a \ncommonsense understanding of the physical world that \ndevelops naturally during the course of a subject’ s life \nand forms his or her conception of how the world works \n(Povinelli, 2000). Differences in folk physics (such as the \nrelationship between rigidity and transfer of force) might \nbe evident if a chimpanzee persistently tried to retrieve an \nout-of-reach banana with a flimsy rope, whereas a person \nsought the same goal using a rigid rake. The rope leads to \nfailure; the rake leads to success. Researchers who study \nchimpanzees’ folk physics have concluded that these ani-\nmals, unlike humans, know little if anything about unob-\nservable physical phenomena (e.g., gravity and transfer of \nforce) and thus cannot invoke abstract causal concepts to \nsolve problems (Povinelli, 2000). \nOne task commonly used to study chimpanzees’ and \nhumans’ folk physics involves the use of a trap table. In \na trap-table problem, two rake tools can be used to drag \na reward along either a flat solid surface (successful re-\ntrieval) or a flat surface with a trapping hole (unsuccessful \nretrieval). Pulling the rake on the side with the trap causes \nthe reward to drop into the hole (see Figure 1A). In other \nvariations, one side of the table has a hole in a position that \nis unlikely to trap a reward (see Figures 1B and 1C). For \nthese two configurations, a bias to pull a rake is evidence \nthat the subject did not invoke the abstract concept “grav-\nity” (Povinelli & Reaux, 2000).\nMost chimpanzees do not easily solve trap-table prob-\nlems, and those that do require considerable trial-and-error \nlearning and/or display unnecessary behavioral biases. In \ncontrast, when people are presented with the schematics \nshown in Figure 1, they avoid choosing the rake on the side \nof the table with a hole, even if the hole is unlikely to trap the \nreward (Silva, Page, & Silva, 2005). Thus, a bias to avoid an \nunlikely trap is not necessarily evidence that a subject cannot \ninvoke the appropriate hypothetical physical constructs.\nIn the experiments reported here, adult humans solved \nreal trap-table problems. The use of adults and simple prob-\nlems allowed us to manipulate features of a problem and \nobserve the effect on people’ s choices—all the while know-\ning that they understood “gravity,” “transfer of force,” and \nthe like (see, e.g., Silva et al., 2005). In other words, this \napproach allowed us to determine environment–behavior \nrelationships in a context in which the participants’ knowl-\nedge of folk physics was transparent. We can then use \nthis information to (1) develop a taxonomy of how differ-\nent environmental variables affect people’ s choices on folk \nphysics tasks, (2) suggest future studies with chimpanzees, \nand (3) provide a context for interpreting chimpanzees’ \n behavior.\nEXPERIMENT 1\nThe goal of Experiment 1 was to use trap-table prob-\nlems to evaluate the influence on people’ s choices of a \nreward’ s distance from a potential trap. We examined \nthe distance between the trap and the reward because the \nparticipants in Silva et al.’ s (2005) study remarked that a \nhole—even one that was unlikely to trap a reward—had a \ngreater chance of trapping a reward than no hole at all. If \nthis concern is the basis for people’ s choices in trap-table \nproblems, then it should be possible to mitigate this worry \nand lessen people’ s avoidance of the side with the trap \nby increasing the distance between a reward and a trap. \nHowever, if the distance between a reward and a poten-\n 689 Copyright 2006 Psychonomic Society, Inc.\nWe gratefully acknowledge a discussion with Bill Timberlake that \nsparked the idea for this study, and the helpful comments of three anony-\nmous reviewers.

SILVA and KATHLEEN M. SILVA\nUniversity of Redlands, Redlands, California\nTwo experiments examined adult humans’ folk physics (i.e., their naturally occurring and spontane-\nous understanding of the physical world) using variations of trap-table problems used to study chim-\npanzees’ folk physics. When presented with these problems, people unnecessarily avoided retrieving a \nreward by pulling a rake on the side of a table with a trapping hole—even though it was highly unlikely \nthat the hole would trap the reward. However, when the distance between the reward and the trap was \nsufficiently large and the distance that the reward had to travel to be retrieved was sufficiently short, \npeople preferred to retrieve a reward by pulling the rake on the side of the table with the trap. These \nresults underscore that behavior during tool-use tasks has many possible causes, only one of which \nmight be a subject’s folk physics.\nPsychonomic Bulletin & Review\n2006, 13 (4), 689-693\n690    SIL V A AND SIL V A\ntial trap is large enough that the trap is not perceived as a \nthreat and the distance over which the rake could access \nthe reward is shorter than the distance on the side with-\nout a trap, then people should choose to use the rake on \nthe side with the trap. Stated another way, if the reward \nis sufficiently safe from the potential trap, people should \nchoose to use the rake that minimizes the distance a re-\nward must travel to be retrieved. This variable is an im-\nportant determinant of people’ s behavior on another task \nused to study folk physics, which involves a trap tube. In \nthis task, people (and probably chimpanzees and capu-\nchin monkeys) choose an alternative that minimizes the \ndistance a reward must travel to be retrieved (see Silva \net al., 2005, and their analysis of studies by Limongelli, \nBoysen, & Visalberghi, 1995; Reaux & Povinelli, 2000; \nVisalberghi & Limongelli, 1994).\nMethod\nParticipants. Thirty-five undergraduate students volunteered for \nthe study and received extra credit for their involvement.\nSetting and Apparatus. The trap tables were constructed of \n0.48-cm-thick white foam board supported 5 cm above the surface \nof a desk. The seven configurations presented to the participants are \nshown in Figures 1A and 2A through 2F . The tables measured 70 \u0013 \n70 cm. For Configuration A in Figure 1 and Configurations A, B, and \nC in Figure 2, a 10 \u0013 30 cm rectangular hole equidistant from the \noutside edge and the center of the table and 15 cm from its top was \ncut into one side of the table. The other side of the table had a painted \n(gray) rectangle of the same size and in the same relative position as \nthe hole on the opposite side. For Configurations D, E, and F in Fig-\nure 2, a 10 \u0013 10 cm square hole whose left edge was 5 cm from the \noutside edge of the table and 30 cm from its top was cut into one side \nof the table. The other side of the table had a gray square of the same \nsize and at the same relative location. The tables were constructed so \nthat the left and right sides were interchangeable.\nThe rakes were constructed from a wood dowel (67 cm long; \n0.63-cm diameter) attached to the center of a 5 \u0013 35 cm piece of \nthe same poster board used for the trap tables. M&Ms served as the \nrewards; in their farthest and nearest positions, they were placed \n38 cm and 19 cm, respectively, from the bottom edge of the table. \nThe order in which the configurations were presented varied ran-\ndomly across trials, as did the left–right positions of the traps.\nProcedure. All of the participants were tested individually. The \nexperimenter set up a trap table before a participant entered the test-\ning room. After the participant had been asked to enter the room, the \nexperimenter told the participant that the experiment was designed \nto examine how people use tools to solve problems, and then in-\nstructed the participant to choose one of the rakes to drag the reward \nto the bottom edge of the table. The participants were explicitly in-\nstructed to drag the reward slowly and to use whichever hand they \npreferred in order to pull the rake. Finally, the participants were told \nA\nB\nC\nFigure 1.

After a partici-\npant made a choice, he or she was asked to step outside of the testing \nroom while the experimenter set up another trap table. After this had \nbeen done, the participant was asked to re-enter the room and make \nanother choice. This cycle repeated itself until each of the seven \nconfigurations shown in Figures 1A and 2A–2F had been presented \nto a participant. Unless otherwise noted, two-tailed binomial tests \nwere used to analyze the results.\nResults and Discussion\nAll 35 participants obtained the reward from all seven \nconfigurations. When the choice was between a rake that \ncould be used to retrieve the reward successfully and a rake \nthat could not (Figure 1A), every person pulled the rake \non the side of the table without the trap (35/35, p \f .001). \nWhen the choice was between pulling a rake on the side of \nthe table with or without a trap—and the distance between \nthe rewards on each side of the table and their correspond-\ning traps or painted “traps” was the same (Figures 2A, \n2B, 2D, and 2E)—most people pulled the rake on the side \nwithout the hole (25/35, 26/35, 24/35, 25/35 [ ps \f .05] \nfor Configurations A, B, D, and E, respectively). How-\never, when the distance between the reward and the trap \nwas greater than the distance between the reward and a \npainted “trap” (Figures 2C and 2F), the participants were \nindifferent about which rake they pulled (19/35 and 21/35 \n[ ps \u000e .31] chose the rake on the side without the hole in \nConfigurations C and F , respectively).\nThese results show that people, unlike chimpanzees, \nreadily choose the rake that allows a reward to be retrieved \nwithout it falling into a trap (Figure 1A). Given the simple \ntasks used and that everyone successfully solved every \ntrap-table problem, we can be certain that all of the par-\nticipants understood the abstract causal features embed-\nded in the problems. The results also indicate that, all else \nbeing equal, people prefer to retrieve a reward on the side \nof the table without a hole, even if the hole is unlikely \nto trap the reward (Figures 2A and 2D). Moreover, and \ncontrary to our prediction, the participants did not lessen \ntheir avoidance of the side with the trap when the risk of \nthe hole trapping the reward decreased (Figures 2B and \n2E). However, it was possible to weaken the bias to avoid \nthis side. When the distance between the reward and the \ntrap was large enough and the distance over which the \nrake could access the reward was shorter than the distance \non the side without a trap, people were indifferent about \nwhich rake they pulled. Had it been only a matter of the \ndistance that the rewards had to travel to be retrieved, the \nparticipants should have been indifferent about which \nrake they pulled in Configurations B and E in Figure 2. \nThat the participants avoided the side of the table with the \nhole (Configurations B and E) means that they were still \nconcerned about the ability of the hole to trap the reward. \nGiven that the distances between the reward and the trap \nin Configurations C and F of Figure 2 were identical to \nthose in Configurations B and E of the same figure, any \nconcerns about the potential trap should have been the \nsame. That the bias for avoiding the side with the hole was \nweakened when the alternative response involved drag-\nging the reward a greater distance suggests that people \nconsider both the distance of the reward from a potential \ntrap and how far the reward must travel to be retrieved. \nThese results are similar to those obtained with trap tubes. \nWith this apparatus, people insert a stick tool into the end \nof the tube to push out a reward that minimizes the dis-\ntance the reward travels (Silva et al., 2005).\nEXPERIMENT 2\nIn Experiment 1, increasing the distance between a \nreward and a trap caused people to become indifferent \nabout which rake they pulled when the reward on the other \n(solid) side had to travel a greater distance to be retrieved \n(Figures 2C and 2F). This effect suggests that, if the dis-\ntance between a reward and a trap was further increased, \nthe side with the hole should be sufficiently “safe” that \npeople would not avoid this side. However, to produce a \nbias for the side with the hole, the distance that the reward \nmust travel on this side might have to be much less than \nthe distance that the reward on the solid side must travel. \nWe evaluated this possibility in Experiment 2.\nMethod\nParticipants. T wenty-seven undergraduates volunteered for the \nstudy and received extra credit for their involvement.\nSetting, Apparatus, and Procedure. The same trap-table appa-\nratus, procedure, and data analyses used in Experiment 1 were used \nin Experiment 2. The only difference was that the location of the \nnearest rewards was 7.5 cm from the bottom edge of the table.\nResults and Discussion\nAll 27 participants obtained the reward from all seven \nconfigurations. When the choice was between a rake that \ncould be used to retrieve the reward successfully and a \nrake that could not (Figure 1A), every person pulled the \nrake on the side of the table without the trap (27/27, p \f \n.001). When the choice was between pulling a rake on the \nside of the table with or without a trap—and the distance \nbetween the rewards on each side of the table and their \ncorresponding traps or painted “traps” was the same (Fig-\nures 3A, 3B, 3D, and 3E)—most people pulled the rake \non the side without the hole when the reward was near a \npotential trap (21/27 and 20/27 [ps \f .01] for Configura-\ntions A and D, respectively). However, when the reward \nwas very far from a trap or painted “trap,” people were \nindifferent about which rake they pulled (15/27 and 16/27 \n[ ps \u000e .44] for Configurations B and E, respectively).\nWhen the distance between the reward and the trap was \nlarge enough and the distance that the reward had to travel \non this side was much less than the distance the reward on \nthe solid side had to travel (Figures 3C and 3F), the par-\nticipants preferred to retrieve the reward on the side with \nthe hole (25/27 and 23/27 [ps \f .001] for Configurations \nC and F , respectively).\nThese results replicate and add to the results of Ex-\nperiment 1. The bias to avoid the side with the trap can \nbe changed to indifference about which rake is pulled by \ngreatly increasing the distance between a reward and a trap \nor painted “trap” (Figures 3B and 3E). In addition, this in-\ndifference can be changed to a bias in favor of the side with \n692    SIL V A AND SIL V A\nthe hole by greatly reducing the relative distance that the \nreward on this side must travel (Figures 3C and 3F).\nGENERAL DISCUSSION\nThis study showed that people’ s choices in the trap-table \ntask were controlled by (1) the presence of a highly effec-\ntive trap (these were avoided), (2) the presence of a potential \nbut unlikely trap (these were avoided under some circum-\nstances), (3) the distance between a reward and a trap (the \ngreater the distance, the fewer people avoided the side with \nthe trap), and (4) the distance a reward had to travel to be \nretrieved (if the distance between the reward and the trap \nwas large enough, people preferred to retrieve the reward on \nthis side). Thus, this study identified four variables that con-\ntrol people’ s responses during trap-table problems and also \nsuggests future experiments that could be conducted with \nchimpanzees. Also, the results of people’ s choices on the \nreal trap-table problems presented in Figure 1 replicated the \nresults obtained when schematics of these problems were \nused (see, e.g., Silva et al., 2005). Thus, whether real or \nschematic trap tables of similar proportions are used, people \nseem to focus on the same critical variables. (For a similar \nresult obtained with trap tubes, see Silva et al., 2005.)\nThat people’ s behavior changed systematically as a func-\ntion of the concrete physical characteristics of the task, but \nnot the abstract causal features of the task, shows the im-\nportance of obtaining more information about the variables \ncontrolling people’ s and nonhuman animals’ behavior in \ntool-use tasks. Knowledge of humans’ folk physics was not \nenough to predict and explain their tool-using behavior. The \nparticipants’ behavior seemed to follow a rule (i.e., avoid \nholes that can trap an object) until another variable (e.g., \nthe distance that the reward had to travel to be retrieved) \nmediated the influence of the rule. Without more informa-\ntion about the many variables that affect behavior during \ntool-use tasks, only the most tentative conclusions can be \ndrawn about the nature of a subject’ s folk physics.\nBefore more definitive conclusions can be reached about \nchimpanzees’ understanding of physical causality, addi-\ntional experiments that vary several physical features of \nthe task will be necessary. The present study highlights the \ninteractive effect of a reward’ s distance from a trap and the \ndistance that a reward must be dragged in trap-table prob-\nlems. Similar experiments with chimpanzees and monkeys \nmight be informative, as might experiments that vary the \ninitial distance of the reward from the tool, the type of re-\nward used (e.g., a primary reward vs. a token), and whether \none or two rakes are available to retrieve the rewards.\nIt should be possible to extend the methodology used \nhere to the study of the folk physics of chimpanzees (see, \ne.g., Povinelli, 2000), monkeys (Visalberghi & Limon-\ngelli, 1994), or birds (Chappell & Kacelnik, 2004). Al-\nthough the purpose of studying these animals is often to \ndiscover what they understand, it should be possible to \nteach them to understand abstract physical concepts and \nthen conduct experiments to determine how different  \nenvironment–behavior relationships affect the expression \nof this understanding (as was done in the present study). \nPovinelli (2000) tried but did not succeed in training most \nof his chimpanzees to learn abstract physical concepts; \nhowever, his methods were very different from those nor-\nmally used to teach concepts (e.g., Herrnstein, 1979; see \nMachado & Silva, 2003). Concept learning requires many \nstimulus–response–consequence pairings, in which irrel-\nevant stimulus dimensions are uncorrelated. But Povinelli \n(2000) avoided using traditional concept learning tech-\nniques because, in his view, this would invalidate the goal \nof studying chimpanzees’ folk physics—that is, their natu-\nrally occurring understanding of physical causality. Al-\nthough explicitly trained understanding (i.e., understanding \nprovided by training in an experiment) seems incompatible \nwith naturally occurring understanding, it is questionable \nwhether there is a meaningful distinction between the two \n(Machado & Silva, 2003). If there is no meaningful dis-\ntinction, then folk physics could be redefined as a subject’ s \nunderstanding of physical causality—without any restric-\ntions about how this understanding comes about. With this \ndefinition, researchers have the flexibility to train animals \nwhose understanding of folk physics is more transparent \nand then to study which variables produce different be-\nhavioral manifestations of their folk physics. This may \nultimately be a better approach than pitting representa-\ntional views against each other (see, e.g., Povinelli, 2000) \nor representational views against ecological views (see, \ne.g., Cummins-Sebree & Fragaszy, 2005).\nTo illustrate, imagine that we had compared two repre-\nsentational models with each other, such as a low level of \nFigure 3. V arious configurations of the trap-table apparatus \npresented to the participants (not drawn to scale). Details are the \nsame as for Figure 2.\nC F\nB\nA\nE\nD21/27\n15/27, n.s.\n20/27\n16/27, n.s.\n25/27 23/27\nHUMANS’ FOLK PHYSICS IS NOT ENOUGH TO EXPLAIN BEHA VIOR     693\nunderstanding with a high level of understanding. A low \nlevel of understanding occurs when subjects learn only a \n“procedural rule, with no accompanying appreciation of \none or more of the causal relations involved” (Povinelli \n& Giambrone, 2000, p. 116). The subject’ s behavior is \nexplained by basic learning principles (e.g., stimulus con-\ntrol or consequent learning). In the absence of stimulus \ngeneralization training and concept learning, behavior is \noften context specific. In contrast, a subject who under-\nstands the abstract causal relations in a “physics problem” \nis showing high-level understanding. The knowledge of \nabstract relations should allow behavior to transfer easily \nto novel contexts.\nHad we followed this approach, our results would have \nsuggested that the participants did not understand the ab-\nstract causal principles embedded in the trap table—but \nonly if we based our conclusions on the configurations \nin Figures 2A/3A, 2B, 2D/3D, and 2E. With these con-\nfigurations, people displayed a low level of understand-\ning. However, when presented with the configurations in \nFigures 3B and 3E, people displayed a high level of under-\nstanding. Given that it is inconceivable that the people in \nthe study did not understand the concept “gravity,” these \nseemingly contradictory results underscore the fact that \nbehavior during tool-use tasks has many possible causes, \nonly one of which may be a subject’ s folk physics.\nREFERENCES\nChappell, J., & Kacelnik, A.
