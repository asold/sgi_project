The most\ncelebrated example is the equivalence between IIB string theory onAdS5 ×S5 and N= 4\nSYM theory [1].\nThe free strings propagating on theAdS5 ×S5 background are believed to be integrable\nfor all values of the t’Hooft coupling. A review of the main results in this direction can\nbe found in [2]. On the ﬁeld theory side, the integrability takes the form of a spin chain\nHamiltonian [3, 4]. The spin chain acts on the list of gauge invariant local operators,\nthe states being generated by traces of words of local ﬁelds ofN = 4 SYM and their\nderivatives. Finding the energy spectrum on the spin chain side corresponds to computing\nthe eigenvalues of the matrix of anomalous dimension of the operators inN= 4 SYM.\nIntegrability, combinedwithsupersymmetryisverypowerful. Aparticularlyimportant\nresult that combines the two is the dispersion relation for magnons on the gauge theory spin\nchain [5]. It follows from a central extension in the symmetry algebra of the spin chain and\nfrom the fact that magnons are in short representations of the centrally extended symmetry\nalgebra. This shortness condition ﬁxes the kinematics.\n– 1 –\nJHEP01(2021)080\nWhen the magnons carry a lot of momentum on the spin chain, they become geomet-\nrically large string solutions in the AdS dual. These are called giant magnons [6]. These\nalso carry central charge on the spin chain. The total central charge of a closed string state\nvanishes because of the level-matching constraint. In the spin chain side this arises from\nthe cyclic property of the trace [7].\nThe central charge on the gauge theory spin chain can also be sourced by open bound-\nary conditions. These can be realized by supersymmetric D-branes in the AdS side, with\nopen strings attached to them. These D-brane states provide a very tractable connection\nbetween the gauge theory dynamics and the AdS geometry. This connection to the cen-\ntral charge extension on the spin chain and gravity dual side has been analyzed in the\nworks [8–14]. Particularly, it has been suggested in [11] that the central charge extension\non the spin chain side is very closely related to the central charge extension of the Coulomb\nbranch ofN= 4 SYM. Our recent work [14] showed how this works on the sigma model\nside for open string states suspended between D-brane states made of AdS giant gravitons.\nA complete picture in the analysis of the spin chain side is still missing.\nAs a reminder, giant gravitons are D-brane states that preserve half the supersym-\nmetry of theN = 4 SYM theory. They can grow into the sphere [15], or into the AdS\ndirections [16, 17]. The ones that grow in the AdS directions are related to (classical)\nspontaneous symmetry breaking fromU(N) → U(N−1) ×U(1) via the Higgs mechanism,\nwhich generates expectation values for the scalars [17] (see also [18]). All of these D-brane\nstates can be understood in terms of the classiﬁcation of half-BPS states inN= 4 SYM\nin terms of Young tableaux [19]. Sphere giant gravitons are represented by long single\ncolumns [20], while AdS giant gravitons are long single rows.\nVery importantly, the AdS giant gravitons explore the radial direction of theAdS5\ngeometry. This has always been the most mysterious emergent dimension in the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence. It has been related to a UV-IR relation [21], where the position in AdS\nis related to the UV scale of physics on the boundary. The radial direction has also been\nrelated to the Renormalization group ﬂow [22] and via the AdS D-branes, it is also related\nto the Higgs mechanism.\nThe radial direction on the spin chain side is much less well understood. Some states\nthat explore the radial direction appear when rotating strings in AdS are studied [23],\nsee also [24, 25]. They are characterized by logarithmic contributions in the spin quan-\ntum number to their anomalous dimension. An argument for their logarithmic scaling of\nanomalous dimension is given in [26]. The open strings strecthing between AdS giants\nthat have been studied previously by us [14] do not have such logarithmic contributions to\ntheir anomalous dimension. Instead, their anomalous dimensions are governed by super-\nsymmetry, and in particular, by the amount of central charge they carry. Their dispersion\nrelation is\n∆ −J =\n√\nQ2 + λ\n4π2 |Z|2, (1.1)\nwhere Q is the angular momentum onS3 ⊂AdS5 and Zis the central charge of the open\nstring, ingeometricunits. Atverylargeangularmomentumonthesphere( Q→∞ ), forthe\n– 2 –\nJHEP01(2021)080\ngiant magnons suspended between D-branes, their anomalous dimension can be arbitrarily\nclose to zero, even at strong coupling. This follows because the square root can be expanded\nin powers ofZ/Q. This is a power series in the t’Hooft couplingλ, and therefore one can in\nprinciple match coeﬃcients order by order in perturbation theory on the CFT side. Other\nsets of works suggest that the giant magnon dispersion relation also plays a role in more\ngeneral geometries. In particular, it has been argued that the central charge extension\ncontrols magnon dispersion relations in concentric LLM geometries [27, 28]. The LLM\ngeometries are solutions of type IIB supergravity onAdS5 ×S5 that preserve exactly half of\nthe supersymmetries [29]. They can be thought of as condensates of sphere giant gravitons\nand/or AdS giant gravitons. In the ﬁeld theory dual, these condensates are expected to\ndescribe the quantum corrected half-BPS Coulomb branch of the ﬁeld theory, where the\ncorrections are induced by the boundary sphere curvature. Because they describe part of\nthe Coulomb branch, one would expect that the central charge extension of the Coulomb\nbranch has a role to play in the dynamics.\nThe LLM geometries depend on a two coloring of a degeneration plane (the LLM\nplane). If the coloring is made out of concentric circles, the background geometry has a\nwell deﬁned additional circular symmetry generated by aU(1) R-charge J. This is the\nsame J that appears in (1.1). For a general LLM background, only∆ −J is well deﬁned.\nThe backgrounds break the J,∆ symmetries independently, leaving ∆ −J = 0 for the\nbackground conﬁguration. The concentric geometries are eigenstates ofJ,∆ in the dual\nﬁeld theory.\nThe purpose of the current work is to address this idea on the sigma model side. In\nparticular, we want to understand exact solutions of the sigma model for open strings\nstretching between sphere giant gravitons or AdS giant gravitons in general LLM geome-\ntries. Thesearemorecomplicatedgeometriesthan AdS5×S5. Togetasimpleﬁniteanswer,\nthere must be interesting cancellations taking place in the gravity calculation. One of our\ngoals to see how this analytic behavior arises in the string sigma model computation.\nIn particular, we will ﬁnd exact expansions in the t’Hooft coupling for∆ −J as above,\nthat can in principle be matched to perturbative computations in ﬁeld theory. It turns\nout, that even though the sigma model in these geometries is not expected to be integrable\n(for example, a naive Bethe ansatz is expected to have inelastic boundary conditions [30]),\nit is under enough analytic control so that these BPS strings are analytically solvable and\nthe dispersion relations for the open strings will look identical to equation (1.1). We pay\nextra attention to geometries that correspond to concentric circles, because they allow us\nto explore the amount of chargeJ that the string carries. It will turn out that the quantity\nJ contains additional information that is not carried by either the angular momentumQ\nor the central charge. It depends on more details of the precise position of the string in\nthe background geometry. Nevertheless, after some manipulations, we will show that it\nalso gives rise to an expansion in the t’Hooft coupling that can be matched between the\nspin chain and the geometry, at least to leading order. These seem to be non-protected\nquantities associated to the symmetries that are spontaneously broken by the D-brane\nbackground for these states. These determine in the end if a putative string state belongs\nto the Hilbert space or if it does not. If theJ charge diverges, the string state is not allowed.\n– 3 –\nJHEP01(2021)080\nSuch phenomena already arise in the spin chain computations [11], so it is important to\nunderstand their behavior in the gravity dual setup as well.\nAnother interesting aspect of the open strings between sphere giant gravitons is that\nthere is a relation of the geometric sigma model solution and the Bethe ansatz on the\nspin chain [10]. When one studies open strings attached to these giant gravitons, sites can\n“jump in” and “jump out” of the spin chain [31]. To have a more standard description,\none realizes the spin chain in a bosonized language. One writes the states in terms of the\nnumber of sites between defects on the spin chain, rather than in terms of spin up and\nspin down state. Now, the number of sites in the spin chain is ﬁxed, and the boundary\nconditions allow number non-conservation for the bosonic excitations instead. If one writes\ncoherent states for these generalized bosons, one ﬁnds that the equations that lead to the\nground state of the spin chain can be understood as a bound state condition on the S-\nmatrix of the magnons, subject to corresponding boundary conditions. Similar results are\nnot known in the dualSL(2) sector. An approximation for theSL(2) sector at very large\nvevs of the central charge for strings stretching between a dual giant graviton and itself can\nbe found in [32], where the “jumping in” and “jumping out” of letters is self-consistently\nignored in the limit of large spin/central charge. A similar connection to the Bethe ansatz\nis not known.\nWe provide evidence in this paper that the open strings stretching between dual giant\ngravitons also have an interpretation in terms of zeros of an S-matrix for theSL(2) sector.\nIn particular, we get a better understanding of the analytic continuation of theSU(2)\nspin chain to theSL(2) sector. We will also show that our interpretation of the analytic\ncontinuation is compatible with the sigma model calculations.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we review the form of all half BPS\nsolutions to type IIB supergravity, and we re-express them in form that makes certain\ncancellationsclearer. Insection3weprovideanexplicitexampleoftheopenstringsolutions\nin question by considering the case ofAdS5 ×S5. In section 4 we solve for open strings\nstretching between both sphere and AdS giants in a general half BPS geometry, ﬁnding\nvery similar expressions to those in the case ofAdS5 ×S5. In section 5 we concentrate\non concentric half-BPS geometries, for which we study the form of the R-chargeJ and its\nrelation to the metric of the half-BPS geometry. In the case ofAdS5 ×S5, we study various\nlimits for which this expression simpliﬁes, and match the leading sigma model answer on\nR ×S3 to a computation on the dual one-loopSU(2) spin chain. We are able to interpret\nthe equations that lead to the sigma model solution as a continuum version of the condition\nfor having a pole of the magnon S-matrix for theSU(2) and SL(2) sectors. The answers on\nboth sectors are related to each other by an analytic continuation of the radial parameter\nof the LLM plane.\n2 Review of LLM geometries\nThe most general1\n2 -BPS solution to IIB 10d supergravity is given by the ansatz [29]:\nds2 = − y√\n1\n4 −z2\n(dt+V)2+\n√\n1\n4 −z2\ny (dy2+dx2\n1+dx2\n2)+y\n√\n1\n2 −z\n√\n1\n2 + z\ndΩ 2\n3+y\n√\n1\n2 + z\n√\n1\n2 −z\nd˜Ω 2\n3 .(2.1)\n– 4 –\nJHEP01(2021)080\nThe only free parameter of this metric is an auxiliary function z of the coordinates\ny,x1,x2, which satisﬁes a six dimensional Laplace equation with rotational symmetry along\nfour directions:\nd\n(\n⋆3\ndz\ny\n)\n= 0\nydV = ⋆3dz.\n(2.2)\nWhere ⋆3 is the Hodge star operation on the coordinates x1,x2,y. In order to ensure\nthe regularity of (2.1), we must have that the quantityH−2 = y√1\n4 −z2 remains ﬁnite as\ny approaches zero. This means that z = ±1\n2 on the y = 0 plane which we will call the\nLLM plane. Because of this, the metric is completely determined by a coloring of the LLM\nplane into regions wherez= ±1\n2 . It will also be convenient to rewrite the metric in a more\ncompact form:\nds2 = H−2\n(\n−(dt+ V)2 +\n(1\n2 −z\n)\ndΩ 2\n3 +\n(1\n2 + z\n)\nd˜Ω 2\n3\n)\n+ H2\n(\ndy2 + δijdxidxj\n)\n. (2.3)\nThis is convenient since the parametrization (2.3) makes the metric explicitly regular at\ny= 0 inside the colored regions. Generically, at the boundary of a droplet the one formV\nbecomes singular, but such singularities can be eliminated via coordinate transformations.\nAn explicit form ofV is:\nVi(x1,x2,y) = ϵij\n2π\n∮\n∂D\ndx′\nj\n(x −x′)2 + y2 . (2.4)\nHere the integration is taken along the boundaries of the droplets. This guarantees that\nVi → 0 as |x|,|y|→∞ . Finally, the regionsz = ±1\n2 are the degeneration loci of the either\none of the two three-spheres, which is clear from equation (2.3).\n3 Open strings on AdS3 × S1\nNow we wish to review the solutions of the Nambu-Goto sigma model corresponding to\nrigidly rotating strings on aAdS3 ×S1 subspace ofAdS5 ×S5 that appeared in [14], but\nstudying the solution directly in the LLM cordinates instead. The corresponding metric\nin the coordinates (2.1) is described by a single droplet conﬁguration on the LLM plane of\nradius r0:\nz(r,y; r0) = r2 −r2\n0 + y2\n2\n√\n(r2 + r2\n0 + y2)2 −4r2r2\n0\nVφ = −1\n2\n\n r2 + r2\n0 + y2\n√\n(r2 + r2\n0 + y2)2 −4r2r2\n0\n−1\n\n .\n(3.1)\nWe will be interested in solutions that reside at they= 0 locus, with a D3 brane wrapping\nthe non-vanishing three-sphere and with the string rotating along a circle of the non-\nvanishing sphere. The eﬀective metric for the space on which the strings move can be\n– 5 –\nJHEP01(2021)080\nwritten in the form:\nds2 = −s\n(\n1 −r2\nr2\n0\n)\n(dt+ Vφdφ)2 + s\n(\ndr2 + r2dφ2)\n(\n1 −r2\nr2\n0\n)\n+ s\n(\n1 −r2\nr2\n0\n)(1\n2(1 −s)dψ2 + 1\n2(1 + s)d˜θ2\n)\n(3.2)\nwith s= sgn(r0 −r). The eﬀective geometry forr > r0 corresponds to AdS5 ×S1, while\nr < r0 corresponds to Rt ×S5. One should also note that the behavior ofVφ at y = 0 is\nnon-trivial asr crosses r0:\nVφ(r<r 0,y = 0) = r2\nr2\n0 −r2\nVφ(r>r 0,y = 0) = r2\n0\nr2 −r2\n0\n.\n(3.3)\nFor r>r 0, the metric is\nds2\nr0\n= −\n(\nr2 −1\n)\ndt2 + 2dtdφ+ dr2\n(r2 −1) + dφ2 + (r2 −1)dψ2 . (3.4)\nWhere the variabler has been re-scaled to be unitless. Now we can consider the string\nsigma model on this geometry, concentrating on rigid open string solutions that end on\ntwo static dual giant gravitons. The boundary conditions allow for the endpoints of the\nstring to move freely along theψ direction, so we restrict to conﬁgurations where the string\nendpoints co-rotate at the same angular velocityβ. A convenient ansatz for the embedding\ncoordinates is of the form:\nt= τ\nr= r(σ)\nφ= φ(σ)\nψ = βτ+ g(σ) .\n(3.5)\nThen, the string action in these coordinates is given by:\nS = −\n√\nλ\n2π\n∫\ndτdσ\n√\n(r2 −1)2g′2 + 2β(r2 −1)φ′g′+ φ′2(β2(1 −r2) + r2) + (1−β2)r′2) .\n(3.6)\nFor the coordinategone has to impose Neumann boundary conditions, which is equivalent\nto saying that the worldsheet current density∂L\n∂g′vanishes at the end points of the string.\nIn addition to this, since the action is independent ofgthis current must vanish identically\nalong the string. This leads to the condition:\ng′= − βφ′\nr2 −1 (3.7)\nwhich can be used to eliminateg in the action. This reduces the problem to a geodesic\nequation on a ﬂat plane, as long asr̸= 1 where equation (3.7) degenerates:\nS = −\n√\nλ\n2π\n√\n(1 −β2)\n∫\ndτdσ\n√\nr2φ′2 + r′2 . (3.8)\n– 6 –\nJHEP01(2021)080\nDuetotherotationalsymmetryofthedroplet, ageneralsolutioncanalwaysbetransformed\nto one determined by a pair of anglesφ1,φ2 from thex1 axis and the closest approach to\nthe origina. These are the same solutions studied in [14] in slightly diﬀerent coordinates.\nIn particular, the conserved charge associated to time translations of the coordinates (3.4)\nfollows a relativistic dispersion relation\nϵ=\n√\nQ2 + λ\n4π2 |Z|2\nQ=\n√\nλ\n2π\nβ|Z|√\n1 −β2\n|Z|=\n∫φf\nφi\ndφ\n√\nr2 +\n(dr\ndφ\n)2\n(3.9)\nwhere Q is the angular momentum associated to rotations alongψ and Zis the central\ncharge associated to the separation of the branes. It is also important to notice that the\ndensity of central charge and angular momentum per unit length are constant along the\nstring. One can also check that the angular momentum densityJ associated to rotations\nalong the LLM plane diverges if the string solution touches boundary of the droplet. We\nwill make this more explicit in section 5.\n4 Open strings on LLM geometries\nWe can now discuss more general solutions corresponding to open strings on general1\n2 -BPS\ngeometries. As we will see these share many similarities to the solutions discussed in the\nprevious section.\n4.1 Strings outside a droplet\nFirst we consider the case for a string inside a connected region withz= −1\n2 . Within each\nof these regions we have a non-vanishing three-sphere on which we can wrap D3 branes.\nIn the end, we will be interested in rotating string solutions, so we will also single out a\ncircle within this three-sphere with coordinateψ on which the string endpoints rotate. The\nbranes will sit aty= 0, but it is convenient to keep the value ofy unﬁxed along the string\nas this makes the various cancellations clear. The appropriate ansatz for the embedding\ncoordinates is the similar to the one before,\nt= ωτ\nxi = xi(σ)\ny= y(σ)\nψ = βτ+ g(σ)\n(4.1)\nexcept that the eﬀective metric is now of the general form:\nds2 = H−2\n(\n−(dt+ V)2 +\n(1\n2 −z\n)\ndψ2\n)\n+ H2\n(\ndy2 + δijdxidxj\n)\n. (4.2)\n– 7 –\nJHEP01(2021)080\nThe Nambu-Goto action in these coordinates is:\nS =\n√\nλ\n2π\n∫\ndτdσ\n√\nG\nG= H−4\n((1\n2 −z\n)\ng′2 + 2\n(\nz−1\n2\n)\ng′Vix′\ni + β2\n(\nz−1\n2\n)\n(Vix′\ni)2\n)\n+\n(\n1 −β2\n(1\n2 −z\n))\n(x′2\n1 + x′2\n2 + y′2) .\n(4.3)\nWhere we have setω = 1 for simplicity. The coordinateg′can be eliminated by a com-\nbination of its equation of motion and boundary conditions as before. This leads to the\nsimple relation which generalizes (3.7):\ng′= βVix′\ni. (4.4)\nOnce again, the relation (4.4) shows that the variableg′becomes ill-deﬁned whenever the\nstring touches the boundary of a droplet (2.4) aty= 0. One can also express this relation\nin a way that is independent of the parametrization,\ndg= βV (4.5)\nso thatdg is well deﬁned in regions wherez is locally constant. Substituting this relation\ninto the action (4.3) will cancel the terms inGwhich are multiplied by the warp factorH,\nwhich simpliﬁes the action to the form:\nS = −\n√\nλ\n2π\n∫\ndτdσ\n√(\n1 −β2\n(1\n2 −z\n))\n(x′2\n1 + x′2\n2 + y′2) . (4.6)\nOne can also ﬁnd a similar expression for the energy of the string by varying with respect\nto ω:\nϵ=\n√\nλ\n2π\n∫\ndτdσ\n√\n1\n(1 −β2(1\n2 −z))(x′2\n1 + x′2\n2 + y′2) . (4.7)\nIn general, having the string extend in they direction makes the equations non-linear, but\nsuch conﬁgurations happen to not have minimal energies. The minimal energy conﬁgura-\ntions are those for whichy= 0 along the string, for which the action reduces to a geodesic\nproblem on the LLM plane.\nS = −\n√\nλ\n2π\n∫\ndτ\n√\n(1 −β2)(dx2\n1 + dx2\n2) (4.8)\nThis is the same result as for open strings between D-branes inAdS5 ×S5, so the kinematic\nfeatures are the same. As a result, this class of solutions also admit a giant magnon\ndispersion relation:\nϵ=\n√\nQ2 + λ\n4π2 |Z|2\n|Z|=\n∫√\ndx2\n1 + dx2\n2 .\n(4.9)\n– 8 –\nJHEP01(2021)080\nGenerically, an LLM geometry will not have rotational invariance along the LLM plane\ndue to the placement of sources forz. This means the chargeJ associated to this rotation\nis no longer a good quantum number in the dual description. However, there is always an\napproximate translational symmetry in the limit that one zooms into the boundary of a\ndroplet. The eﬀective geometry in this limit is always a plane-wave, and the density of the\nmomentum associated to the approximate translational symmetry will generically diverge.\nThis is because such quantities are always proportional to the gauge potentialV which is\nnot well deﬁned at the interfaces between the diﬀerent values ofz.\n4.2 Inside a droplet\nThe analysis for connected regions withz = 1\n2 is completely analogous to the one in the\nprevious section. In this case there is a diﬀerent non-vanishing three-sphere˜S3, from which\nwe single out a circle˜θ. The eﬀective metric is a simple variation of (4.2)\nds2 = H−2\n(\n−(dt+ V)2 +\n(1\n2 + z\n)\nd˜θ2\n)\n+ H2\n(\ndy2 + δijdxidxj\n)\n. (4.10)\nThe appropriate ansatz in this case is the same as before (3.5), but we replace the variable\nψ by:\n˜θ= ˜βτ+ h(σ) . (4.11)\nThe computation of the action is entirely analogous as to the discussion in the previous\nsection. The analogous condition (4.4) that arises from the boundary conditions forh is:\nh′= ˜βVix′\ni (4.12)\nwhich tells us thath′is the pullback ofV on the worldsheet inside the droplet regions.\nThis means thath′has the same singularities along interfaces asg′did, so that continuing\nthe variableg to regions inside a droplet becomes problematic. After eliminatingh, the\naction takes the same form as before with the appropriate change in kinematic factors:\nS = −\n√\nλ\n2π\n∫\ndτ\n√\n(1 −˜β2)(dx2\n1 + dx2\n2) . (4.13)\nSimilarly, the energy can be easily shown to satisfy a similar relativistic dispersion relation\nϵ=\n√\n˜Q2 + λ\n4π2 |Z|2 . (4.14)\nWhere ˜Q is the angular momentum along the circle˜θ.\n5 On-shell charges\nFor this section we will concentrate on1\n2 -BPS geometries that correspond to concentric\ndroplets and rings on the LLM plane. This is useful since we will want to study the\nbehavior of the chargeJ associated to rotations around the origin of the LLM plane. One\nimportant point that should be noted is that the coordinates (2.1) are implicitly rotating\n– 9 –\nJHEP01(2021)080\nwith respect to an observer that is far away from the sources to whom the geometry looks\nlike AdS5 ×S5. So solutions that are static in these coordinates correspond to strings that\nrotate along a cycle that asymptotically looks like the equator ofS5. As such the charge\nϵassociated to time translation symmetry in the LLM coordinates actually corresponds\nto ∆ −J in the global AdS coordinates. One can ﬁnd the expression forJ for a general\nconcentric geometry by modifying the ansatz for the coordinateφ (3.5) to include time\ndependence,\nφ= ϕ(σ) + γτ (5.1)\nand in the end substituting the on-shell valueγ = 0. Unlike the charges ϵ,Z,Q( ˜Q) the\nangular momentum J turns out to be sensitive to the details of the geometry. This is\nbecause the general form ofϵis ﬁxed by supersymmetry [5], and the other charges assemble\ninto a relativistic dispersion relation. As discussed in [11], the shortening condition is\nessential to get the right multiplicities for light open strings between nearby giants. This\nis what guarantees that the local physics looks likeN= 4 SYM on the Coulomb branch.\nFor concreteness we ﬁrst concentrate on the case where the strings live in a region outside\na single circular droplet on the LLM plane, and then we show that the analysis extends\nto solutions sitting inside the droplet. The resulting expression forJ and its density along\nthe string are:\nJ =\n√\nλ\n2π\n∫\ndσJ\nJ=\nVφ\n(\n(φ′)2\n(\nr2\n(\n(H2+1)(1−β2)\n2H2 + 1\n)\n+\n(1\nH4 + 1\nH2 +2\n)\nV2\nφ(β2−1)\n2H2\n)\n+ (r′)2\n)\n√\n(1 −β2)\n(\nr2 (φ′)2 + (r′)2) .\n(5.2)\nFrom this we can see that the densityJ is proportional to Vφ, so that it becomes\ninﬁnite at the boundaries of the droplets as claimed. Since the central charge density is\nconstant on-shell we can also express this as:\nJ = ϵ\n∫\ndσVφ +\n( λ\n4π2\n)1\nϵ\n∫\ndσφ′2\n(\nr2(1 + H−2) −V2\nφ\n(\nH−2 + H−6 + H−4\n2\n))\nϵ=\n√\nQ2 + λ\n4π2 Z2 .\n(5.3)\nOne can also express the densityJin terms of the quantum numbersQ, Z, the t’Hooft cou-\npling λand r. For completeness we will carry this out for the simplest droplet conﬁguration\nstudied in section 3, in the regime that the strings are far away from the droplet.\n5.1 Strings near the boundary\nWe would like to evaluate (5.2) for a string solution that sits very far away from a single\ndroplet, while the size of the string remains ﬁnite but large. These correspond to strings\nthat sit near the boundary ofAdS5. As it turns out, the expression (5.2) is not the same\nas the angular momentum measured by an asymptotic observer in global AdS, since the\n– 10 –\nJHEP01(2021)080\ncoordinates (3.4) describe a rotating frame˜φ= φ−t, so that the expression forJ is actually\na linear combination of the scaling dimension∆ and the spin ˜J seen by a static observer\nnear the boundary. The two quantitiesJ, ˜J are related by a simple change of coordinates,\nbut it is more convenient to work with the expressions in [14] which have a clearer physical\ninterpretation. More concretely, this is the choice of coordinates for which the scaling\ndimension ∆ grows with the distance from the origin, while the spin˜J becomes smaller:\n˜J =\n√\nλ\n2π\n∫\nd˜φ\n( dr\nd˜φ)2 + β2 −1 + r2\n(r2 −1)\n√\n(1 −β2)(r2 + (dr\nd˜φ)2)\n. (5.4)\nHere ˜φ= φ−tcorresponds to the coordinate for the equator of theS5. We should also note\nthat this expression for ˜J is not gauge invariant, as it will turn out that this expression\nis related to the one formV that appears in the metric. On the one hand these gauge\ntransformations can be always absorbed into a redeﬁnition of the string coordinatesg and\nh (4.4). However, one should also keep in mind that gauge transformations that vanish\nat inﬁnity do not change the asymptotics of˜J, so that the coordinate choices for which\n˜J vanishes at inﬁnity are well-deﬁned. In order to ﬁx the residual gauge symmetry one\nhas to choose coordinates that look asymptotically like static global AdS rather than the\nrotating LLM coordinates. It will also be convenient to make the choiceVr = 0 in order to\nkeep the rotational symmetry explicit.\nWe wish to ﬁnd an expression for (5.4) in terms of the angular momentumQ, the string end\npoints ξ1,ξ2, and the t’Hooft couplingλ. For this, it is best to re-express the integral using\nan aﬃne parametrization for the complex coordinate on the LLM planez= ξ1(1−s)+ ξ2s.\nIn order to eliminate the angular velocityβ, we have to impose a double scaling limit based\non (3.9). The particular double scaling limit we will be interested in comes from ﬁxing the\nangular momentumQ and the positions of the end points of the string:\nQ\nZ=\n√\nλ\n2π\nβ√\n1 −β2 <∞. (5.5)\nThis is a physical choice of scaling, since the strings become tensionless in the relativitic\nlimit β → 1. This leaves us with two independent parameters to tune which we can\nchoose to be the ratioQ\nZ and the t’Hooft coupling, since changing the value ofβ has to be\ncompensated by a change ofλin order to keepQand Zﬁxed. This means that the angular\nvelocity and the t’Hooft coupling can’t be changed independently from each other. The\nfull expression for˜J in terms of these parameters can be expressed as a sum of two terms:\n˜J =\n√\nQ2 + λ\n4π2 |ξ1 −ξ2|2\n∫1\n0\nds\nz¯z−1 +\n( λ\n4π2\n) 1√\nQ2 + λ\n4π2 |ξ1 −ξ2|2\nIm\n∫1\n0\nds zd¯z\nds\nz¯z(z¯z−1) .\n(5.6)\nThis expression is interesting as it is a series expansion inλaround zero, while also showing\na scale separation given at small and large energiesϵ.\nIn particular, one can expect that this quantity can be recovered via a perturbative\ncalculation in the dual ﬁeld theory since we have a series expansion in the t’Hooft coupling.\n– 11 –\nJHEP01(2021)080\nThis is diﬀerent from in the other giant magnon solutions studied in the literature which\nalways have inﬁnite spin ˜J and correspond to closed strings [6, 33]. Alternatively, one\ncan expand inκ = λ/Q2, which can be done even at strong coupling. This is similar to\nhow in the plane wave limit the eﬀective perturbation parameter depends on the quantum\nnumbers of an excitation [7].\nWe will reproduce the leading term of the expansion in thesu(2) sector by an explicit\ncomputation from the one-loop spin chain Hamiltonian with boundary conditions. Moti-\nvated by an analytic continuation of the Bethe ansatz, we will obtain an expression for the\nsl(2) spin chain with open boundary conditions, even when we do not know the form of\nthe precise computation on the dual ﬁeld theory for this sector. In general, these boundary\nconditions are expected to break integrability, but the existence of a Bethe-like ansatz for\nthe su(2) in terms of Cuntz oscillator coherent states suggests that a similar story exists\nfor the sl(2) spin chain. One should also note that even though the leading term is in-\ndependent of λ, the computation requires knowing the one-loop mixing Hamiltonian for\nthe su(2) sector, and higher order corrections arise from higher loop contributions to the\nmixing of operators.\n5.1.1 Rapidly rotating strings\nAn interesting limit to consider is when the strings rotate with a large angular velocity\nβ → 1 with ﬁxed angular momentumQ. This is the limit where the t’Hooft coupling\nbecomes small, so that the second term in (5.6) can be ignored.\n˜J = |Q|\n∫1\n0\nds\n|ξ1(1 −s) + ξ2s|2 −1 + ... (5.7)\nThe integral in (5.7) is somewhat reminiscent of a Feynman parametrization, and can\nbe evaluated explicitly:\n˜J = |Q|\narctan\n(\n|ξ2|2−|ξ1|2+|ξ1−ξ2|2\n2\n√\n|ξ1×ξ2|2−|ξ1−ξ2|2\n)\n−arctan\n(\n|ξ2|2−|ξ1|2−|ξ1−ξ2|2\n2\n√\n|ξ1×ξ2|2−|ξ1−ξ2|2\n)\n√\n|ξ1 ×ξ2|2 −|ξ1 −ξ2|2 + ...\nξ1 ×ξ2 = Im\n(\nξ1 ¯ξ2\n)\n= |ξ1||ξ2|sin θ12 .\n(5.8)\nIn the limit that the string end points are very far away from the origin we can ignore the\n1 in the denominator of (5.7):\n˜J = θ12|Q|\n|ξ1||ξ2|sin θ12\n+ ... (5.9)\nAlthough the expression (5.9) is regular atθ12 = 0 where the string end points are colinear,\nthere is a divergence atθ12 = πcoming from the fact that the string has to cross the droplet.\nIn the strictξ→∞ limit, the leading order contribution for˜J vanishes. Generically, in\nthe strict β → 1 limit the divergent contributions to the LLM angular momentum will\ndecouple so that the expressions for˜J and J match. More explicitly, the expression (5.2)\nbecomes much simpler in this limit.\nJ =\n√\nλZ√\n1 −β2\n∫1\n0\ndsVφ(r(s),y = 0) + ... (5.10)\n– 12 –\nJHEP01(2021)080\nWhere r(s) is an aﬃne parametrization for the string in the LLM plane. It also turns\nout that the expression (5.10) is valid inside and outside the droplet regions as long as\none chooses the correct branch forVφ(y = 0). Another thing to note is that value ofVφ\ninside of the droplet is related to its value outside the droplet by a change of sign and a\ntransformation r → r2\n0\nr , wherer0 is related to the AdS radiusr2\nAdS = r0. By restoring the\ndependance onr0, the expression (5.9) should be understood as the leading order expansion\nin r0/m2, wherem2 is a large mass parameter compared tor0. This can be done by either\nsending the string end points to inﬁnity, or by considering a small droplet. This is also the\nregime where the contribution to masses of the conformally coupled scalars coming from\nthe curvature ofR×S3 is negligible in the ﬁeld theory, which is a decompactiﬁcation limit\nof the S3. This suggests that the leading non-vanishing term inJ at large β should be\nreproducible from a Coulomb branch computation, while the higher order terms in powers\nr0 should come from taking into account correctly the mixing between the higgsinos and\ngauginos, since a priori the massive vectors do not couple to the curvatureRS3 ∼RAdS. A\ncalculation with background ﬁelds properly included would look similar to [34], where the\nlocalization in the geometry is provided directly by the D-brane background ﬁelds, rather\nthan a saddle point.\nFor more general concentric droplet geometries the expression forVφ outside the largest\ndroplet is given by a linear combination of droplets [29]:\nVφ(r,y = 0) =\nk∑\ni=0\n(−1)ir2\ni\nr2 −r2\ni\n(5.11)\nThe leading expression for ˜J in this case can be easily seen to come from adding the\ncontributions coming from all the droplets and holes:\n˜J = |Q|\nk∑\ni=0\n(−1)i˜Ji\n˜Ji = r2\ni\n\n\narctan\n(\n|ξ2|2−|ξ1|2+|ξ1−ξ2|2\n2\n√\n|ξ1×ξ2|2−r2\ni|ξ1−ξ2|2\n)\n−arctan\n(\n|ξ2|2−|ξ1|2−|ξ1−ξ2|2\n2\n√\n|ξ1×ξ2|2−r2\ni|ξ1−ξ2|2\n)\n√\n|ξ1 ×ξ2|2 −r2\ni|ξ1 −ξ2|2\n\n+ ...\n(5.12)\nThis suggests that the leading order computation on the dual ﬁeld theory side also\ncomes from summing simple contributions and at leading order the droplets don’t aﬀect\neach other.\n5.2 Strings inside a droplet\nWe can also do the analogous computation for string solutions sitting inside a circular\ndroplet region. In this case the motion of the string is restricted to anS3 ×R subspace of\nAdS5 ×S5. It is well known that the giant magnons onS3 ×R have a dual description in\nterms of asu(2) integrable spin chain whose Hamiltonian computes the mixing of operators.\n– 13 –\nJHEP01(2021)080\n5.2.1 Dual spin chain picture\nThe one loop Hamiltonian for theSU(2) sector with open boundary conditions is of the\nform [11, 31]:\nH1 = λ\nk∑\ni=0\n(a†\ni −a†\ni+1)(ai −ai+1) (5.13)\nHere a0 and ak+1 are complex numbers describing the collective coordinates of the giant\ngravitons, and theai are Cuntz oscillators satisfying the algebra:\naia†\nj = δij\na†\niai = 1 −|0⟩i⟨0|i\n(5.14)\nThe integerk+ 1 is associated to the angular momentum˜Q which counts the number of\nsites of the oscillator chain, which has a length corresponding to the central chargeZ. In\nthe gauge theory variablesk counts the number ofY insertions betweenZ in the operator:\nO∼ ...ZZZYL1 Z...ZY Ln ...\n∑\ni\nLi = k+ 1 (5.15)\nA complete combinatoric picture of how the strings are attached to the giants and how\nthe boundary conditions emerge is found in the works [35–38]. To ﬁx the angular position\nof the brane one needs to add a coherent state description of the D-branes [8]. These\ndiscussions usually only pertain to theSU(2) sector. For he SL(2) sector, an incomplete\ndescription in the Cuntz oscillator language is found in [32], which was derived from [39].\nThis description of theSL(2) sector is not that of a spin chain with local nearest neigh-\nbor terms only. This makes a direct analysis very cumbersome. When we discuss such\ncalculations, we will sidestep this direct route of computation by utilizing ideas from the\nBethe ansatz.\nWe then proceed by considering an unnormalized coherent state for each oscillator:\n|zi⟩=\n∞∑\nn=0\nzn\ni |n⟩ (5.16)\nSubstituting this into the Hamiltonian and minizing the energy one obtains the condition\nzi −zi+1 = δZfor every adjacent pair of sites, whereδZis a constant which acts as a\nlattice spacing for the string. The quantityδZis generically complex, but we can always\nalign the coordinates so that it is real.\nThis means that the central charge density along the chainZ\n˜Q is a ﬁxed constant. It\ncan also be checked that this is in fact an eigenstate of the one-loop Hamiltonian with\nminimal energy.\nOne can easily check that,\n⟨¯z|z∂z|z⟩=\n∞∑\nn=0\nnzn|n⟩= z¯z\n(1 −z¯z)2\n⟨¯z|z⟩= 1\n1 −z¯z.\n(5.17)\n– 14 –\nJHEP01(2021)080\nSo that the average occupation number for each site is given by:\n⟨¯z|z∂z|z⟩\n⟨¯z|z⟩ = z¯z\n1 −z¯z (5.18)\nThis occupation number also computes the R-chargeJ for each oscillator, so that in total\nwe have:\nJ =\nk∑\ni=1\nzi¯zi\n1 −zi¯zi\n. (5.19)\nSince the central charge density along the string is constant, we can multiply each term by\nthe central charge density|δZ|= |zi −zi−1|= Z\nk\nJ = |˜Q−1|\nZ\nk∑\ni=1\nzi¯zi\n1 −zi¯zi\nδZ−→ δZ→0 |˜Q|\n∫1\n0\nds z¯z\n1 −z¯z. (5.20)\nThe sum can then be approximated by an integral as we take the eﬀective lattice spacing\nδZto zero, by which one expects to recover the continuum string description.\n5.2.2 Sigma model computation\nThe computation of the spinJ for the sigma model is straightforward. In this case we\nshould take the metric withr <1 where the string motion occurs onS3 ×R as opposed\nto AdS3 ×S1. As before we will be interested in the double scaling limit that arises from\ntaking ˜β → 1 while holding the angular momentum˜Q and central charge constant. The\ncharge ˜Q and angular frequency ˜β should not be confused withQ and β although their\nroles are very similar. The leading order expression is simply:\nJ = |˜Q|\n∫1\n0\ndsVφ(r(s),y = 0) . (5.21)\nAgain, we can introduce an aﬃne parametrization for the complex variable on the LLM\nplane z= η1(1 −s) + η2s and re-express (3.3) in complex coordinatesr2 = z¯z:\nJ = |˜Q|\n∫1\n0\nds z¯z\n1 −z¯z. (5.22)\nWhich matches the spin chain computation precisely. We can evaluate the integral explic-\nitly by noting that there is a simple relation between the angular momentum density inside\nand outside the droplet,\nz¯z\n1 −z¯z = 1\n1 −z¯z −1 . (5.23)\nWhich reduces to the same integral (5.8) as before:\nJ+ |Q|= −|Q|\narctan\n(\n|η2|2−|η1|2+|η1−η2|2\n2\n√\n|η1×η2|2−|η1−η2|2\n)\n−arctan\n(\n|η2|2−|η1|2−|η1−η2|2\n2\n√\n|η1×η2|2−|η1−η2|2\n)\n√\n|η1 ×η2|2 −|η1 −η2|2 + ... (5.24)\n– 15 –\nJHEP01(2021)080\n5.3 Magnon S-matrix and Bethe Ansatz\nAn interesting property of the coherent state ansatz for the one-loop Hamiltonian is that\nit leads to solutions to the Bethe equations. To see this more explicitly, substituting the\ncoherent state ansatz into the Hamiltonian and minimizing over the complex parameters\nzi one ﬁnds that their second diﬀerence vanishes:\nzi+1 −2zi + zi−1 = 0 . (5.25)\nWe can always choose to parametrize the complex variableszi = eρi, which leads to the\nrelation:\neρi+1−ρi−1 −2eρi−ρi−1 + 1 = 0. (5.26)\nTo make the connection to the Bethe ansatz more explicit it is convenient to make a change\nof variables:\nipl+1 + ipl = ρl+1 −ρl−1\nipl = ρl −ρl−1 .\n(5.27)\nSolving these relations leads to an expression purely in terms ofp1,2,\neip2+ip1 −2eip1 + 1 = 0 (5.28)\nwhich can be recognized as a pole for the 2-magnon S-matrix for theSU(2) sector:\nSsu(2)\n12 = −eip2+ip1 −2eip2 + 1\neip2+ip1 −2eip1 + 1 = u1 −u2 −i\nu1 −u2 + i\neipl = ul −i/2\nul + i/2 .\n(5.29)\nThe interpretation of this pole is that we have formed a bound state of the magnons. Such\nmagnon bound states have the same dispersion relation of (3.9), as they are also in short\nrepresentations of the centrally extended spin chain [40]. In this sense, the Bethe ansatz\ncomputation and the sigma model are fully consistent with each other.\n5.3.1 Analytic continuation to SL(2)\nAnother important fact is that the 2-magnon S-matrix for theSL(2) sector is related up\nto a phase factor to the inverse of theSU(2) S-matrix (we follow [41]):\nSsl(2)\n12 ∝− eip2+ip1 −2eip1 + 1\neip2+ip1 −2eip2 + 1 = u1 −u2 + i\nu1 −u2 −i\neipl = ul + i/2\nul −i/2 .\n(5.30)\nIn the formula above, the right hand side of the S-matrix looks the same, but the identi-\nﬁcation of momentum with theu variable diﬀers, and is clearly the inverse of the one of\nSU(2) above.\nIn particular, the role of poles and zeros is exchanged with respect to theSU(2) sector.\nNaively one would expect that the Cuntz oscillator representation of theSU(2) Hamiltonian\n– 16 –\nJHEP01(2021)080\ncan be analytically continued by allowing the complex parameterszi to lie outside the unit\ndisk, but this is not the case because then the ground state is no longer normalizable and\nthe S-matrix would not have the correct pole structure. In particular the relation (5.25)\nwould lead to a zero of the 2 magnon S-matrix rather than a pole. If instead one exchanges\nzi ↔ 1\nzi\n= ˜zi, one ﬁnds that the zeros of (5.29) are exchanged with poles, while having\n|˜zi|>1. Substituting this directly in (5.19) leads to the expression:\nJ =\nk∑\ni=1\n1\nzi¯zi −1 (5.31)\nwhere k now counts the number of derivatives between theZ operators as opposed to\ncounting the number of Y insertions between Z’s. When we take the continuum limit\nof this expression one obtains the same integral that appears in the string sigma model\ncomputation forAdS3 ×S1.\nThis analytic continuation also appears naturally in the LLM coordinates as the trans-\nformation that maps the inside and outside of a droplet to each other. It now also appears\nas a consistency condition for the analytically continued S-matrix. The fact that the string\nsolutions are straight lines on the LLM plane would translate to having a pole on the\nmagnon S-matrix for theSL(2) sector.\n6 Discussion\nIn this work we studied a class of open string solutions ending on (dual) giant gravitons\nin 1\n2 -BPS geometries of type IIB string theory. We showed that important simpliﬁcations\nhappen when one takes into consideration the appropriate boundary conditions for the end\npoints of the string. The solutions found have a relativistic dispersion relation so that\nthey generalize the giant magnon solutions to open strings in more general backgrounds.\nThis dispersion relation is related to a shortening condition of the central charge extension\nsymmetry on the worldsheet. In the solutions we studied, the strings are allowed to extend\ninto the non-compact dimensions of the spacetime, and they have well-deﬁned ﬁnite charges\ninside droplet regions in the LLM plane. We also found that the solutions cannot be\nextended between regions of diﬀerent colors in the LLM plane without having divergences\nin the approximate charges that generate translations parallel to the droplets, or in the\ncase of concentric geometries the angular momentumJ associated to rotations in the LLM\nplane. Additionally, the coordinates of the string along the non-vanishing three-sphere ﬁber\ndirections are related to the pull-back of a one formV of the geometry, so that the string\ncharge density on the ﬁber (and the analytic solution itself) diverges at the boundaries of\nthe droplets. As a consequence, one can expect that the operators corresponding to such\ncrossing string solutions do not exist within the class considered. These divergences are\nalso suggestive of possible instabilities for the states corresponding to the solutions where\nthe strings grace a droplet, like when one crosses a wall of marginal stability ( see also [11]).\nLess supersymmetric solutions are allowed if the strings leave the LLM plane.\nFinally, although one can explictly match the sigma model answer forJ to a simple\ncomputation in theSU(2) sector of the dual spin chain description, the analogous com-\n– 17 –\nJHEP01(2021)080\nputation for theSL(2) has not been carried out and seems quite diﬃcult. The fact that\nthe sigma model predicts that the central charge is a constant per unit worldsheet angular\nmomentum (charge) appears in the dualSU(2) spin chain description as a condition on the\ncoherent state ansatz for the excited states. These conditions on the parameterszl = eρl\ncan be related to a Bethe ansatz solution to the Heisenberg spin chain, where the ratios\nzl/zl+1 behave like Bethe roots.\nIt is natural for us to expect that a similar condition should arise in theSL(2) sector, as\nthe sigma model descriptions of both sectors are analytic continuations of each other. This\nBethe ansatz analysis was carried out by us in this paper and gives rise to a consistency\ncheck with the sigma model computation. The analysis is interesting in that the variables\nthat would naturally play the role ofzi, which are required to satisfy|zi|<1 on the sphere\nneed to be transformed tozi → 1/zi so that now they are lying outside the LLM plane.\nThis is exactly what is required to exchange the poles and zeros in the S-matrix, which is\na natural relation between theSL(2) and SL(2) Bethe ansatz S-matrices.\nSimilar bubbling solutions exist for six dimensional supergravity [42, 43] but the details\nof the geometries are more complicated. Our results seem to apply to an isolated class of\nthese geometries, at least when the torus ﬁbration of the geometries is a product of circles.\nThe analysis for general 6d1\n2 BPS bubbling geometries is complicated by the appearance\nof an axion corresponding to the oﬀ-diagonal component of the metric for the torus ﬁber,\nwhich introduces additional singularities where non-trivial sectional circles of the torus\nvanish. Similarly, when we try to work with1\n4 and 1\n8 BPS geometries in ten dimensions,\nthe ﬂat LLM plane is replaced by a four or six dimensional Kähler base with three or\nﬁve dimensional droplets [44], and constructing explicit metrics is a very non-trivial task.\nIn all these situations the backgrounds preserve only8 or 4 supersymmetries rather than\n16 and this seems to be the main reason the analysis is more complicated. Even open\nstrings suspended between AdS giants inAdS5 ×S5 that together only preserve1\n4 of the\nsupersymmetries seem to have additional corrections. We are currently investigating these\nissues. These might be more tractable in the limit that the AdS giant gravitons carry very\nlarge charge, as in this limit the analysis also simpliﬁed for the1\n2 BPS case.\nAcknowledgments\nThe work of D.B. is supported in part by the Department of Energy under grant DE-\nSC 0011702.\nOpen Access.
