Protection and overloading protection in \na particular, is one of the measurement strategies to \nimprove power system’s reliability status.\nIn Ethiopia, many customers were suffering from elec\n-\ntric power interruptions. There were many malfunctions \ndistribution transformers in Dangila town. Major causes \nof this malfunction of the distribution transformer was \noverloading conditions which can be easily prevented \nthrough overloading protection [3–5]. Currently, the \npractice of overloading protection in Ethiopia is low [3, \n6, 7].\nEven though the government of Ethiopia developed \nstrategies for energy supply, there is the varying level of \nintervention were being given both at the community \nlevel and energy centres [8]. The efforts were not organ\n-\nized at the level of practice and this is due low number of \nresearches to explore overloading protection in Ethiopia \n[9–11]. Therefore, the aim of this study was to protect the \ndistribution transformers in Dangila town, Ethiopia.\nMain text\nMethods\nStudy setting and period\nA Failure Modes and Effects Analysis were conducted in \nDangila town from April 1 to June 3, 2019. Dangila is the \ncapital city of Dangila woreda in Amhara regional state. \nIt is 78 km away from Bahir Dar which is the capital city \nof Amhara regional state. The city has five sub towns, one \nsubstation, which gives serves to the town and the sur\n-\nrounding people.\nQuestionnaires were distributed to Ethiopia Electric \nUtility maintenance staffs. The questionnaire assesses the \nconsequences of failures in terms of electric power inter\n-\nruption, damage of the components or further damage of \nsubsequent sub systems.\nMeasurement\nData were collected using interview and direct meas -\nurement. The questionnaire was prepared to collect \nOpen Access\nBMC Research Notes\n*Correspondence:  hizkielabraham@yahoo.com\nBahir Dar University Institute of Technology, P .O.Box 26, Bahir Dar, Ethiopia\nPage 2 of 6Nebey  BMC Res Notes           (2020) 13:17 \nthe relevant data [3 , 12]. Two weeks were given for data \ncollectors and supervisors for 3  days on methods of \nextracting the information through interviewing, and \ndirect measurement.\nMathematical modelling for determining KVA ratings\nThere were a mathematical equation for determining \nKVA rating of transformer, one and two.\nFrom the collected data following parameters were \ncalculated.\nFor load assessment area of A\nReal power\n From this the load current can be calculated\nThen to find the KVA rating of the transformer A,\nFrom this the transformer rating was selected. For safety \npurposes and expansion, in case more loads were added \nat a later date. Therefore, transformer rating was approxi\n-\nmately 315 KVA.\nFor load assessment area of B\nIn similar way:\nRated power were the sum of the entire total load that \ndelivered to the consumer.\nFrom these load currents was calculated as;\nThen to find the KVA rating of the transformer B\nP = (175020+ 14700+ 34000+ 4050) W\n= 227770 W\n= 227.770 kW\n.\n(1)\nIL = real power√\n3 ∗Vs ∗pf\n= 227770 W\n1.73∗380 ∗0.8= 227770 W\n526 V = 433 A\n.\n(2)\nKVA A = real power\nPF\n= 227.770\n0.8 kW = 285 KVA.\n.\nReal power= (18340 + 187285+ 34000) W\n= 239625 W\n= 23.9625 KW\n.\n(3)\nIL = real power√3 ∗vs∗pf\n= 23.9625 KW\n1.73∗380v ∗0.8 V = 23.9625 KW\n526 V = 455.5 A.\n.\nFrom this the transformer rating was selected above this \nvalue because the transformer rating was greater than the \nactual load. This was done for safety purposes and expan\n-\nsion, in case more loads were added at a later date. There-\nfore, the transformer rating was approximately 315 KVA.\nMathematical modelling of two load sharing of transformers\nTwo transformers of equal voltage ratios were selected for \nworking in parallel. This can avoid a circulating current \nbetween the transformers [13–16].\nFrom the above (Fig. 1) circuit the following parameters \nwere calculated.\nHere, \nAnd  Z\nequ is the equivalent impedance of the two trans -\nformers given by,\nFrom Eqs. (5), (6) and (7)\n(4)\nKVA B = Real power\nPF\n= 242.245 KW\n0.8 = 303 KVA.\n(5)IA ZA = IBZB = ILZL = V\n(\nsay\n)\n(6)ZA = RA + XA\n(7)ZB = RB + XB\n(8)IL = IA + IB\n(9)Zequ = ZA ZB\nZA + ZB\n(10)IA = V\nZA\n= ILZL\nZA\n= IL\nZB\nZA + ZB\nFig. 1 Equivalent circuits of parallel transformers\nPage 3 of 6\nNebey  BMC Res Notes           (2020) 13:17 \nFrom the above it has seen that the transformer with \nhigher impedance supplies lesser load current and vice \nversa. If transformers of dissimilar ratings were paralleled \nthe transformer with a larger rating shall have a smaller \nimpedance as it has to produce the same drop as the \nother transformer, on a larger current. Thus the ohmic \nvalues of the impedances must be in the inverse ratio of \nthe ratings of the transformers.\nModelling of fuzzy logic base protective relay\nThe Fuzzy logic interface (Additional file  1: Figure S1) \nwas used to make decisions [17–19]. Thus it is more pre -\ncise than conventional relaying techniques. The Fuzzy \nlogic controller was an intelligent tool to manage the \nloading condition, so as to protect transformers from \noverload conditions.\nThe proposed fuzzy logic based input was defined as:\nT\n1L, represents the load of transformer one.\nT2L, represents the load of transformer two.\nMembership function for proposed control\nThe membership function defined how the input is \nmapped to member values [20–23].\nT\n1L, represents the membership function load of \ntransformer one (Additional file 2: Figure S2). It con-\nsists small, medium and large.\nT\n2L, represents the membership function load of \ntransformer Two (Additional file 3: Figure S3). It con-\nsists small, medium and large.\nThe output power was membership functions of the pro -\nposed control system (Additional file  4: Figure S4). The \noutput linguistic values were not shared, share, and trip \n(Table 1).\nProposed control rule\nThe control rule content was linguistic variables [24–27]. \nThese linguistic descriptions take from if then rule. The \nproposed control had nine rules for transformer over\n-\nloading protection that consist input antecedents and \nconsequences of output (Additional file 5: Figure S5). The \nrules are shown in (Fig. 2).\n(11)IB = V\nZB\n= ILZL\nZB\n= IL\nZA\nZB + ZA\nIA Z A = IB Z B , therefore IA\nIB\n= Z B\nZA\nOverall controller system\nTransformer load one and transformer load two were the \ninput parameters of the controller.  T\n1L and  T2L indicates \nthe load of transformer one and load of transformer two \nrespectively. The load for each transformer was assumed \nto the Gaussian random signal generator. The multiport \nconditional switch (Additional file  6: Figure S6) will take \nan action according to the rules written and loaded in the \nfuzzy logic controller.\nOperational definition\nOverloading protection: If power system protection were \nused to protect the distribution transformer from over\n-\nloading conditions [20, 28–31].\nResult and discussion\nSimulation result\nThe controller looks the load on transformer first and made \ndecisions (not share, share and trip) to protect transform\n-\ners. Therefore, there was no equipment failure and power \ninterruption due overloading conditions.\nIn order to evaluate the performance of rule based load \nsharing system, three various types of loads were applied at \nthe output of the distribution transformer\nCase (I): The two transformers were at normal state.\nWhen the two transformers were at normal state, \nduring this time the sharing relay was not energized \nbecause it feeds its load at normal state.\nCase (II): when one of the transformers was over\n-\nloaded.\nWhen one transformer was at normal state and \nanother was overloaded, at this condition the sharing \nrelay was energized to share the load.\nCase (III): The two transformers were overloaded for \neach phase.\nWhen two transformers were overloaded, at this condi\n-\ntion the relay will trip to protect transformers.\nTable 1 Rule base of transformer load\nT2L T1L\nSmall Medium Large\nSmall Not share Not share Share\nMedium Not share Not share Share\nLarge Share Share Trip\nPage 4 of 6Nebey  BMC Res Notes           (2020) 13:17 \nConclusion\nThe work was all about how to supply power intelli -\ngently manage an overload condition. The system auto -\nmatically connects and disconnects switch to share the \ntransformer loads. Most of the villages were suffering \nwith electric instructions. This was due to transformer \nfailure. A recommendation to decrease power interrup\n-\ntion in the town was: Load sharing of transformer to \nprotect from failures. This load sharing was modelled \nto the town; therefore, this transformer load sharing \nsystem was the best solution to protect equipment fail\n-\nure and electric instructions.\nIntelligent controller was used to make intelligent \ndecisions by sensing amount of the load on the trans -\nformer. Rule base fuzzy logic controller manages the \nload and transformers were protected from overload \ncondition.\nLimitations\n1. Possible demand growth rate with population and \neconomic growth rate (load forecasting).\n2. Further study can be carried out for sensing fault \ncurrent, surge voltage (consider more parameters).\nSupplementary information\nSupplementary information accompanies this paper at https ://doi.\norg/10.1186/s1310 4-019-4880-1.\nAdditional file 1: Figure S1.
