  "abstract": "In this work fuzzy logic is applied to Roger’s IEC-599; as it is the most popular method, which dissolved gases in the insulating oil are analyses through gas chromatography and ratios (Rl=CH4/H2, R2=C2H2/C2H4, R3 =C2H2/CH4, R4=C2H6/ C2H2, and R5=C2H4/C2H6) are calculated for the purpose of detecting of two different kinds of incipient faults: electrical and -thermal faults, whereby each type of failure can be subdivided into different categories , So in this work construct an expert system that measures the level of dissolved gases and suggests weather the power transformer is normal or faulty, and if it was faulty what might be responsible for the accumulation of these gases. The system developed show that the obtained results are satisfactory.",
