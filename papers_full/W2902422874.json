  "abstract": "The influence of the thermal field of a transformer during operation on the thermal stability of meta-aramid insulation paper was studied through molecular dynamics simulations. Models of the crystalline and amorphous regions of meta-aramid fibers were constructed using known parameters. The model of the crystalline area was verified by comparing X-ray diffraction results with experimental data. The reasonableness of the simulation results was judged by the variation of energy, temperature, density, and cell size in relation to the dynamic time. The molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the modulus values in the crystalline regions were two to three times higher than those in the amorphous regions at various temperatures. In addition, the incompressibility, rigidity, deformation resistance, plasticity, and toughness of the crystalline regions were obviously higher than those of amorphous regions, whereas the toughness of the amorphous regions was better than that of the crystalline regions. The mechanical parameters of both the crystalline and amorphous regions of meta-aramid fibers were affected by temperature, although the amorphous regions were more sensitive to temperature than the crystalline regions. The molecular chain motion in the crystalline regions of meta-aramid fibers increased slightly with temperature, whereas that of the amorphous regions was more sensitive to temperature. Analyzing hydrogen bonding revealed that long-term operation at high temperature may destroy the structure of the crystalline regions of meta-aramid fibers, degrading the performance of meta-aramid insulation paper. Therefore, increasing the crystallinity and lowering the transformer operating temperature may improve the thermal stability of meta-aramid insulation paper. However, it should be noted that increasing the crystallinity of insulation paper may lower its toughness. These study results lay a good foundation for further exploration of the ways to improve the performance of meta-aramid insulation paper.",
