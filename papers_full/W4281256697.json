    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been prominent in most hyperspectral image (HSI) processing applications due to their advantages in extracting local information. Despite their success, the locality of the convolutional layers within CNNs results in heavyweight models and time-consuming defects. In this study, inspired by the excellent performance of transformers that are used for long-range representation learning in computer vision tasks, we built a lightweight vision transformer for HSI classification that can extract local and global information simultaneously, thereby facilitating accurate classification. Moreover, as traditional dimensionality reduction methods are limited in their linear representation ability, a three-dimensional convolutional autoencoder was adopted to capture the nonlinear characteristics between spectral bands. Based on the aforementioned three-dimensional convolutional autoencoder and lightweight vision transformer, we designed an HSI classification network, namely the “convolutional autoencoder meets lightweight vision transformer” (CAEVT). Finally, we validated the performance of the proposed CAEVT network using four widely used hyperspectral datasets. Our approach showed superiority, especially in the absence of sufficient labeled samples, which demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of the CAEVT network.",
