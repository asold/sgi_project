INTRODUCTION\nTopological transformer models for low-frequency transients\nhave been a subject of extensive studies over the last few\ndecades. The state of art in this ﬁeld was presented in [1] and,\nmore recently, in [2] and [3]. Despite the obvious progress\nin their development, the topological models may still be\ninaccurate when the core approaches saturation [4]. This is\nprimarily related to the commonly used three-legged core\ntype transformers. As these transformers have no return limb\nto pass the zero-sequence (ZS) ﬂux, the core saturation and\ndifferent unbalanced conditions result in a signiﬁcant off-\ncore ﬂux. An appreciable part of this ﬂux penetrates into\nthe transformer tank that makes the tank representation an\nimportant element of the whole transformer model.\nCurrently available tank models have been reviewed in [3]\nwhere no consensus was found among their authors. As far as\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Bora Onat.\nwe know, the only model demonstrated to accurately repro-\nduce nonlinear nature of all ZS impedances of a three-legged\ntransformer is that proposed in [5]. Although the model in [5]\nwas extended to the transformer with vertical shunts [6], there\nare still unresolved issues in the tank representation. It was\npointed in [3] that the tank model [5] needs to be tested for\n(i) zero-sequence power loss, (ii) global saturation of the tank\nunder balanced over-excitation, for example in the presence\nof geomagnetically-induced current (GIC), and (iii) local\nsaturation of the tank for unbalanced over-excitations, for\ninstance during inrush current events or a single-phase to\nground fault.\nIt should be noted that the above mentioned regimes are\nquite different in nature, and it is impossible to ﬁnd a trans-\nformer tested in all these speciﬁc cases. Even conﬁning\nthe study to ZS characteristics, it is difﬁcult to ﬁnd trans-\nformer ZS impedances measured simultaneously with ZS\npower losses. To our knowledge, the only such study was\nreported in [7] and then by the same authors in [8] and [9]\nVOLUME 7, 2019 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License. For more information, see http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ 102519\nJ. zhaoet al.: Topological Transient Models of Three-Phase, Three-Legged Transformer\nwhere linear steady-state transformer models have been\nproposed.\nIn such a situation, it is advisable to concentrate ﬁrst on\nthe model’s ability to replicate all eight ZS characteristics of a\n45/16.05/10 kV 25 MV A three-winding transformer provided\nin [7]. It will be shown that the ZS impedances and corre-\nsponding losses can be reproduced accurately using different\nsets of model parameters. So, having ﬁtted the model using\nseveral parameter sets, we then examine their inﬂuence on the\ntransformer behaviors during inrush current, single-phase to\nground fault, and under GIC.\nThe models considered in Sections II to V can be classiﬁed\nas lumped-distributed circuits. In Section VI we also evaluate\npossibilities of the conventional topological model [10] in\nwhich ZS paths and associated losses are represented by per\nphase circuits L0R0.\nII. TRANSFORMER MODELING IN ZS TEST\nA simple experiment in which all magnetic ﬂux leaves the\ncore is the ZS test. In accordance with standards, the ZS\nimpedance Z0 is measured at the rated frequency between the\nline terminals of wye-connected windings connected together\nand their neutral. It is also noted in standards that the ZS\nimpedance may have several values because it depends on\nhow the other windings are connected. All possible ZS tests\nfor a YNyn0d transformer are listed in Table 1 [7].\nTABLE 1. Zero sequence test codes.\nThe ZS impedances and the three-phase active power\nlosses for the tests in Table 1 measured on the 25 MV A\ntransformer in [7] are represented by separate dots in\nFigs. 1 and 2, respectively.\nFrom the modeling perspective, the most challenging ZS\ntests are those designated as HOO and LOO in Table 1.\nThe ZS magnetizing impedances measured in these tests are\nshown by upper points in Fig. 1.\nIn these tests, magnetic ﬂuxes within the transformer tank\nare roughly sketched in Fig. 3 which depicts, for simplicity,\nonly excited windings which are either high voltage (HV)\nor low voltage (LV) coils. All other windings are not shown\nin Fig. 3 because they are left open-circuited or unloaded.\nA fundamental characteristic of the ZS test is that the ZS\nﬂuxes 80A, 80B, and 80C in the legs are nearly equal in\namplitude and phase, so there are no ﬂuxes in the yokes.\nAt the same time, the off-core paths of the ZS ﬂuxes can be\nFIGURE 1. ZS transformer impedances measured in [7] (separate dots),\nand those calculated with the proposed transformer model (lines). Solid\nand dashed curves are for hysteresis and non-hysteresis tank\nrepresentations, respectively.\nFIGURE 2. ZS power losses measured in [7] (dots) and those calculated\nwith the transformer model proposed (lines).\nquite different due to the asymmetrical position of the core in\nrelation to all four tank walls.\nThis makes the transformer +tank arrangement a three-\ndimensional (3D) structure, which is quite complex and\ntime-consuming to analyze with ﬁnite-element solvers [11].\nTo build a tractable circuital model, it is convenient to\ndivide the off-core ﬂuxes into the ﬂuxes 8T entering the tank\nand the ﬂuxes 8YY returning from yoke to yoke through non-\nmagnetic paths between the tank walls and core legs. In turn,\nﬂuxes 8T can be subdivided into the ﬂuxes 8TC entering the\ntank cover and those, 8TW, penetrating the walls. Somewhere\nin the upper part of the walls, ﬂuxes 8TC and 8TW recombine\ninto the ﬂux 8T.\n102520 VOLUME 7, 2019\nJ. zhaoet al.: Topological Transient Models of Three-Phase, Three-Legged Transformer\nFIGURE 3. Magnetic fluxes and eddy currents in the tank walls of a\nthree-legged transformer excited with the ZS single-phase voltage. The\narrows show the reference directions of the alternative fluxes.\nIf the tank cover is farther from the core than the walls\nthen it can be assumed, without the loss of generality, that\nno appreciable ZS ﬂux enters the cover.\nIn the lower part of the walls, ﬂux 8T passes to the tank\nbottom where it changes direction to ﬁnd the shortest path to\nthe lower core yokes.\nThe 3D nature of the transformer +tank arrangement\nin Fig. 3 is also caused by the fact that eddy currents,\ninduced by the vertical time-varying ﬂux 8T in the walls,\nﬂow horizontally, making the tank walls a closed single-\nturn winding, which encloses all three core legs and their\nwindings [12], [13]. The outlined 3D ﬂux pattern makes it\ndifﬁcult to evaluate ZS impedances and losses in acceptable\ntime (the latter is important for transient modeling). Existing\nFEM solvers take hours or days to analyze even quarter\ntransformer models [11], which are not suitable to simulate\ntank walls as a ﬁctitious winding. Besides, as in the case of the\ntransformer in [7], not all of its design parameters are often\navailable.\nIn this situation, it is reasonable to develop further the\nsimple transformer model proposed in [5]. The need for\nimproving the model is caused by its 30 percent underesti-\nmate in predicting ZS power losses. This underestimate is\ndue to the assumption that the ZS losses are only due to eddy\ncurrents (EC) designated in Fig. 3, which ﬂow horizontally\nin the TWB along all four walls.\nIn the model described in Section III, we propose a simple\nmeans, which allows one to take into account the losses\nbeyond the TWB. They may be caused by ﬂuxes 8TW,\nwhich enter the walls normally or obliquely to their surface\nand induce eddy currents ﬂowing in the planeof the walls.\nBesides, the losses in the tank bottom and cover are also\naccounted for indirectly in the updated electric model.\nIII. TOPOLOGICAL TRANSFORMER MODEL\nThe electric model of the three-winding transformer in Fig. 4\nwas obtained by applying the well-known duality transforma-\ntion to the magnetic transformer model in Fig. 2 of [5]. The\n1:1 turns ratio of three ideal transformers (ITs) at terminals\nof the middle winding 2 points out that the model parameters\nare referred to N2 turns in this LV winding. Turn ratios n of\nITs at terminals of the inner (delta-connected) winding 3 and\nthe outer (HV) winding 1 are determined by corresponding\nvoltage ratios.\nIn its main features, the model in Fig. 4 coincides with\nthe model in Fig. 16 of [5], in which the processes in the\nlegs and yokes are reproduced by DHM-inductors, which\nare ATP implementations of the dynamic hysteresis model\n(DHM) [14], [15].\nIf LS12, LS23, and LS13 are leakage inductances between\nwindings 1-2, 2-3, and 1-3, respectively, then\nLp =(LS13 −LS12 −LS23)/2, (1)\nL12 = LS12 +Lp and L23 = LS23 +Lp. The negative\ninductances in the vertical branches (-L p) are to satisfy all\nthree leakage inductances of the transformer [5].\nThe paths of the yoke-to-yoke ﬂux 8YY are characterized\nby three linear inductances LYY, and the paths of ﬂux 8T are\ndetermined by three inductances LT.\nThe TWB of the height hT and thickness d is represented\nby a ladder Cauer circuit consisting of n pi-cells (n = 15\nin Fig. 4). Each of the SHM-inductors characterizes a vertical\nﬂux tube with length hT and cross section pT ×δ where\npT is the tank perimeter and δ = d/n is the thickness of\nthe tank wall ‘‘layer’’. When using EMTP-ATP, the SHM-\ninductors [16] can be employed. Eddy-current resistances R\nof the layers are calculated as N2\n2 pTρ/(hTδ) where ρ is the\nresistivity of the tank steel. If necessary, resistances R can be\nmade temperature-dependent, as suggested in [17].\nIt was found in numerical experiments that all ZS tests are\nreproduced accurately using the Cauer circuit with n =15.\nWhen modeling other abnormal regimes, the circuit with n =\n25 was found to be acceptable.\nA simple but important improvement to the model is a\ntank loss resistor Rloss. Its parallel connection with the wall\nCauer circuit in the duality-derived model of Fig. 4 means\nthat in the parent magnetic model, this element is in series\nwith the TWB. This means that Rloss allows one to cover\nthe losses in the tank parts, which are above and below the\nTWB. These include tank bottom and cover, as well as the\nmagnetic structural parts. As the detailed loss evaluation in\nthese non-homogeneous elements is hardly possible within\nthe electric model, the use of the effective Rloss is an appropri-\nate method to reproduce unaccounted ZS losses. It is impor-\ntant that the value of Rloss meeting one of the ZS tests provides\nnecessary increases in ZS losses in all the other ZS tests.\nBefore studying transformer behavior under overexcitation\nconditions, the model was ﬁtted to measured no-load losses.\nWhen using the ATP model in Fig. 4, the ﬁtting can be carried\nout by selecting a core material from the DHM library [15]\nand choosing its loss coefﬁcient Kloss [14]. As seen in Fig. 5,\nthe use of steel 27ZDKH85 provides sufﬁcient approximation\nof the measured losses in the whole voltage range.\nFig. 5 also shows that at the voltages normally used in ZS\ntests, i.e. at V <10-12%, the core losses can be neglected.\nVOLUME 7, 2019 102521\nJ. zhaoet al.: Topological Transient Models of Three-Phase, Three-Legged Transformer\nFIGURE 4.

Switch S opens the inner tertiary winding.\nFIGURE 5. Positive sequence no-load power losses measured (solid line)\nand calculated (dashed line) with the model of the core type transformer.\nThis means that the ZS impedances are almost not sensitive\nto the core material.\nIV. MODEL FITTING TO ZS TEST REPORT\nIrrespective of the model version considered in this study,\nthe model is always ﬁtted so that the Z 0-curve HOO in\nFig. 1 passes through points 1 to 4. This is achieved by\nvarying only inductances LYY and LT. A useful observation\nis that increasing LYY moves the Z 0 curve upward, whereas\nincreasing LT makes it steeper near the mentioned points\n1−4. The per unit (pu) values of iteratively found inductances\nLYY and LT are listed in Table 2 where the ZS loss error is the\naverage error in predicting the total transformer losses for the\npoints 1 to 4.\nTABLE 2. Model characteristics and parameters.\nThe model 1 (M1) in Table 2 is the model in [5], in which\nthe height of the TWB is equal to the height of the core\nwindow, as suggested in [18], or nearly 60% of the tank wall\nheight as pointed out in the table. The ZS loss error (-33.4%)\nof model 1 points out that the losses in the TWB reproduce\nabout 67% of the total ZS loss.\nThe model 2 (M2) in Table 2 illustrates the important fact\nthat no substantial change in the ZS loss occurs if the height\nof the TWB is increased to the core height, becoming 95% of\nthe wall height. As pointed out in Table 2, no resistor Rloss is\nused in models 1 and 2.\nThe models 3 (M3) and 4 (M4) in Table 2 contain Rloss and\ntheir TWB height is again equal either to 60% or 95% of the\nwall height, respectively.\nFor any given Rloss, a pair LYY – LT is found as\ndescribed above in this Section, and the loss discrepancies at\npoints 1 to 4 (in Fig. 2) are evaluated. So, starting at Rloss =0,\nthe value of this resistor is increased in steps until the loss\nvalues at points 1 to 4 are approximated accurately. Corre-\nsponding values of Rloss, LYY, and LT are given in Table 2.\nAfter ﬁtting the models to the values determined by\npoints 1 – 4 in Figs. 1 and 2, the zero sequence impedances\n102522 VOLUME 7, 2019\nJ. zhaoet al.: Topological Transient Models of Three-Phase, Three-Legged Transformer\nand the corresponding losses were checked against all other\nmeasured values without any further ﬁtting of the model.\nThe fairly accurate prediction of transformer behavior at any\nother voltage and winding connection conﬁrms the under-\nlying physics of the model. In particular, the model with\nhysteretic steel of the tank reproduces the peaked curves HOO\nand LOO in Fig. 1 and even a subtle peak in curve HOC near\npoint 5.\nIt should be pointed out that all these peaks disappear if the\nmodeling is carried out using a middle (anhysteretic) curve\nof the tank material. In this case, the hysteretic inductors\nSHM in the model of Fig. 4(a) are replaced by nonlinear\ninductances shown in Fig. 4(b). It is shown in Fig. 1 that at low\nvoltages, the dashed curves LOO and HOO, calculated with\nsuch an anhysteretic model, deviate from the corresponding\nsolid curves. At the same time, the ZS losses provided by\nanhysteretic models are only some three percent less than\nthose predicted by the models with ‘‘hysteretic tank’’. This\nis in accordance with the estimation in [19] that ‘‘hysteresis\nlosses tend to be small relative to eddy current losses in\nthe tank’’. It was also recently shown in [17] that dynamic\nlosses dominate over hysteresis losses at all induction levels\nand frequencies in 4- and 6-mm thick tank steels studied\nin [17].\nThis allows one to make practical calculations using the\nsimple non-hysteretic tank model, whilst utilizing the hys-\nteresis tank representation to illustrate the underlying physics\nof the model.\nIt should be said that the curves in Figs. 1 and 2 are\ncalculated for model 4 of Table 2. However, the model 3 gives\nalmost the same ZS characteristics. This means that from\nthe viewpoint of the ZS behavior, the height of the TWB\n(with corresponding LYY, LT, and Rloss) is a free parameter\nof the model. This allows one to use the TWB height as an\nadditional variable, which can control the model behavior in\nregimes different from those in ZS tests.\nIn concluding this section, it is useful to consider the\ncommonly-used concept of the skin effect and its applica-\nbility to the tank walls during Z0 tests, for example in the\ntest HOO. As the skin depth is evaluated through a constant\npermeability µ (the tank material is thus supposed to be\nmagnetically linear), it is instructive to compare processes\ninside tank walls calculated for a hypothetical linear and the\nreal (saturable) tank materials.\nIn the linear case, the straight B-H line of the tank steel\ncan be aligned with the initial (linear) part of the middle\ncurve of the steel. The calculations carried out with a linear\nCauer circuit yield an unrealistically high induction (8 Tesla)\nat the inner wall surface (see Fig. 6) and near exponen-\ntial decrease in the induction peaks along the tank wall\nthickness d.\nQuite different ﬂux density envelope (solid curve in Fig. 6)\nis obtained for the real tank steel in which the rise of the\nsurface ﬂux density in Fig. 7 is limited by the saturation. This\ncompels the next wall layers to reach higher ﬂux densities\nthan those in the linear material.\nFIGURE 6. Envelopes of maximum flux densities over the wall thickness\nd calculated in the HOO test.\nFIGURE 7. Flux densities in the 1, 3, 5, and 7 layers of the 15-layer tank\nwall during HOO test.\nV. MODEL BEHAVIOR UNDER OVEREXITATION\nCONDITIONS\nFrom a variety of possible cases in which the tank model is\nconsidered to be important, we conﬁne ourselves to analysis\nof inrush currents, a single-phase to ground fault, and trans-\nformer behavior under GIC conditions. These regimes are\nchosen to show their qualitative and quantitative difference\nregarding the processes in the tank walls and different impacts\nof the tank representation on the modeled results.\nIn accordance with [7], the 45 kV HV network has\n2500-MV A short-circuit (SC) power, and thus SC per phase\nimpedance Z1 =452/2500 =0.81 . For the 45 kV network\nconsidered, resistance R1 and reactance X1 of impedance Z1\ncan be deduced from the typical ratio R1/X1 = 0.2. So,\nin this Section, the network is represented by positive and zero\nsequence inductances 2.526 mH and resistances 0.162 .\nFor comparison, the leakage inductance between HV and LV\ntransformer windings referred to the HV side is 27.74 mH.\nTo make transformer characterization more complete,\ninrush currents and one-phase ground faults on the yn\nside are modeled for the four winding connections listed\nin Table 3. Among them, the Yyn connection (the one with\nthe ungrounded HV neutral and without delta) is not often\nused in practice, but was found to be most inﬂuenced by\nthe tank representation. Each cell of Table 1 also contains\na mean characteristic calculated with models 1 to 4 deﬁned\nin Table 2. The bracketed percentages indicate maximum\nVOLUME 7, 2019 102523\nJ. zhaoet al.: Topological Transient Models of Three-Phase, Three-Legged Transformer\nTABLE 3. Inrush and SC currents found with models 1 to 4.\ndeviations of the values found with models 1 - 4 from the\ngiven means.\nTo explain the small difference between the models 1 to 4\n(small deviations in Table 3), inrush current events and fault\ncurrents are considered in Sections V-A and V-B.\nA. TANK BEHAVIOR DURING INRUSH\nCURRENT TRANSIENTS\nWhen modeling inrush currents, we assume a demagnetized\nand unloaded transformer model in Fig. 4, which is connected\nto the voltage sources at the instant (t =0) when the voltage\nof phase A crosses zero. The current waveforms in Fig. 8 are\ncalculated with model 4 in Table 2, but similar processes are\npeculiar to all other models of the table, as can be seen in\nsmall percentages provided in the brackets of Table 3.\nThe largest is the current peak in phase A found for\nYNyn transformer, for which phase currents B and C are\nalso depicted in Fig. 8. To avoid overloading the ﬁgure, only\ncurrents A are shown for YNynd and Yyn connections.\nFig. 9 shows ﬂux densities in the legs of the YNyn trans-\nformer. The rounded peaks of the waveforms indicate leg\nsaturation beyond ±2 T. (Recall that 2 T is the saturation\ninduction of grain-oriented steels). The curve ZS in Fig. 9 is\nthe sum of the shown ﬂux densities, which can be recalculated\ninto the ZS ﬂux.\nThe shape of curve ZS in Fig. 9 is reﬂected in the shape of\nthe ﬂux density in the inner wall layer shown by the curve\nInner (YNyn) in Fig. 10. As the ZS ﬂux is comparatively\nsmall in the YNyn transformer, it does not reach the middle\nof the wall (the curve Middle (YNyn) looks like a horizontal\nline).\nFIGURE 8. Inrush currents calculated on the HV terminals.\nFIGURE 9. Flux densities in the legs of YNyn transformer and their sum\n(curve ZS).\nIt is noted in Fig. 8 that current peaks predicted at the closed\ndelta winding, i.e. in the YNynd transformer, are some 10%\nless than those calculated in the YNyn unit. The ﬂuxes in\nthe tank become negligibly small in the presence of delta\nthat makes YNynd transformer less informative from the\nviewpoint of the tank modeling. So, YNynd transformer is\nnot considered in more detail in this Section.\nSomewhat unusual, in Fig. 8, are smaller two-humped\npeaks calculated for Yyn transformer. Their shape and height\n(923 A in Table 3) can be explained by the ﬂoating neutral\npoint N and the neutral-to-ground voltage oscillating within\n±12 kV during the inrush transient.\nIn this case, there is a large ﬂux density in the tank wall\nlayers (see curves Yyn in Fig. 10) showing that the walls\nplay the role of an external, closed delta winding. Model 1\nwas tested experimentally in [20] where the predicted inrush\ncurrent peak on the HV side of a 300 kV A Yyn transformer\nwas only 3% lower than the measured one.\nThe neutral shift is substantially decreased if the actual\ninner delta winding is closed. The ﬂuxes in the walls of Yynd\ntransformer are also decreased and inrush current peaks are\n102524 VOLUME 7, 2019\nJ. zhaoet al.: Topological Transient Models of Three-Phase, Three-Legged Transformer\nFIGURE 10.

TRANSFORMER MODELING AT SINGLE-PHASE FAULT\nBecause fault currents are typically much larger than load\ncurrents, it is assumed that there are no loads on the LV side\nwhen the transformer is supplied from the HV side. At the\ninstant when C-phase voltage on the HV side crosses zero,\nthe LV side phase C is solidly grounded.\nAs shown in the two last columns of Table 3, maxi-\nmum fault current (in phase C on the HV side) was found,\nas expected, in YNynd transformer. Its waveform calculated\nwith model 4 can be seen in Fig. 11, in which phase cur-\nrents A and B practically coincide after the fault instant due\nto the balancing effect of, primarily, the actual, closed delta\nwinding, as well as the tank walls that act as a virtual closed\ndelta winding. Flux densities in the core legs and in the tank\nwall layers are shown in Figs. 12 and 13, respectively.\nDetailed study of single-phase faults for different winding\nconnections deserves a separate dedicated paper. The only\nconclusion to be drawn from the summary Table 3 is that\nFIGURE 12. Flux densities in the legs of YNynd transformer during SC\nfault.\nFIGURE 13. Flux densities in the tank wall layers of YNynd transformer\nduring SC fault.\nSC fault currents calculated with models 1 to 4 for a given\nwinding connection have very close peak and rms values\nin steady-state. (The deviations from the mean values never\nexceed 2.3 percent).\nC. MODEL BEHAVIOR UNDER GIC CONDITIONS\nTo analyze the behavior of the transformer considered in the\npresence of GIC, it is supposed that a source of dc step voltage\nis introduced (at t =0.5 s) between the HV neutral and the\nearth of the modeled circuit.\nThe transient and steady-state phase currents calculated for\nmodel 1 of Table 2 are similar to those in Figs. 10 and 11\nof [3], which correspond to open and closed delta winding\nrespectively. As in [3], the transients under GIC are predicted\nfor the case when the dc voltage provides a 300 A dc current\nin the HV neutral (in steady state) and thus 100 A dc current\nin each of the phase windings.\nThe main indicator of transformer operation under GIC\nis the reactive power Q consumed from the network [21].\nThe values of Q predicted by models 1 to 4 are summarized\nVOLUME 7, 2019 102525\nJ. zhaoet al.: Topological Transient Models of Three-Phase, Three-Legged Transformer\nTABLE 4. Reactive power and maximum flux density in the legs.\nFIGURE 14. Flux densities in the 1, 5, and 13 layers of the 25-layer tank\nwall of YNyn transformer under GIC.\nin Table 4, which also contains the Q value calculated with\nmodel [10] considered in Section VI.\nThe main thing to note in Table 4 is that different models\nwith the same Z0 predict quite different reactive powers. This\nsuggests that Z0 itself has no direct relation to transformer\nbehavior under GIC. The reason may be in that the tank\nbehavior during the ZS test employed for the model ﬁtting\nis qualitatively different from that in the presence of GIC.\nThis is because the ZS test is essentially a power frequency\nac test, whereas the steady-state ﬂux densities in all the tank\nwall layers under a large GIC seem almost constant on the\nscale of Fig. 14. (In the calculations with model 1, the wall\nthickness (8 mm) was divided into 25 layers).\nSmall oscillations seen in the magniﬁed inset of\nFig. 14 completely disappear in YNynd transformer.\nModels 3 and 4, which provide realistic ZS losses due to the\nintroduced resistor Rloss, predict much higher reactive powers\n(1.007 and 1.573 Mvar) than models 1 and 2 (with Q =0.386\nand 0.653 Mvar), which have the same TWB heights.\nIt is remarkable, however, that no changes occur in the\nresults predicted by models 3 and 4 (in the presence of GIC) if\nresistor Rloss is omitted from these models, with other param-\neters kept unchanged. This is in accordance with eddy-current\nnature of Rloss and the fact that all eddy-currents disappear\nunder almost dc conditions taking place in the tank at large\nGIC.\nAs models 1 and 2 differ in the height of the TWB, this\nvalue, as suggested above, can be used as a model variable.\nThis conclusion is supported by the fact that inductance L0T\n(it characterizes the space beyond the tank) has no visible\ninﬂuence on the model behavior under GIC considered.\nAlthough no GIC test was carried out on this particular\ntransformer that could be used to verify the differences in its\nreactive power consumption as predicted by models 1-4 (they\nare listed in Table 4), it can be recalled that the GIC inﬂuence\nis not a critical issue for three-legged (3L) transformers. This\nis because 3L transformers are far less sensitive to GIC than\nanalogous ﬁve-legged (5L) counterparts.\nTo demonstrate this fact, starting from the model consid-\nered, we should insert the DHM inductors into conductors\na-b and c-d of the circuit in Fig. 4 to reproduce the end\nlimbs of 5L transformer. The transformer’s wound legs and\nwindings are kept equal to those in the 3L unit, but the cross\nsections of the yokes and the end limbs are taken equal to\n60 and 50 percent of the main leg area. The core geometry\nis completed by assuming the widths of the lateral windows\nequal to half the main window width. Our calculations carried\nout with thus obtained 5L model predict some 20 times\ngreater reactive power consumption and twice less ﬂux in the\ntank compared to those in the 3L transformer.\nVI. TRANSFORMER MODEL WITH LUMPED ELEMENTS\nFrom a practical viewpoint, it is desirable to use a sim-\nple transformer model capable of simulating zero sequence\nimpedances and losses. A useful topological model, in this\nregard, is the one described in [10], which should be extended\nto a three-winding transformer and supplemented by induc-\ntances L01 lost in [10] when passing from the magnetic\ncircuit in Fig. 11(b) to its electric equivalent in Fig. 11(c).\nSuch a model can be obtained by short-circuiting inductances\nLT in Fig. 4 and shunting inductances LYY (inductances L0\nin [10]) by suitable resistances R0.\nThis cuts off the Cauer circuit and reduces the model\nin Fig. 4 to the form shown in Fig. 15. The thus obtained L0R0\nmodel is a compact equivalent of the model [10] in which L0\nand R0 are split into two equal halves.\nThe values L0 and R0 of the model can be calculated with\nformulae in [10] or easily found iteratively by numerical\nsimulations. It should be noted that the pair L0 −R0 depends\non the measured Z0 and P0 to which the model is adjusted\nat a given V 0. The almost horizontal lines HOO and LOO\nin Fig. 16 illustrate the case when the model is ﬁtted so as\nto meet ZS impedance (Z 0 =75.1%) and three-phase power\nloss (P0 =71.9 kW) measured in the test HOO at V 0 =7.7%\n(these P0 and Z0 are represented by points 4 in Figs. 2 and 16,\nrespectively).\nAlthough the solid lines in Fig. 16 obviously deviate from\nthe dashed Z0 curves calculated with the lumped-distributed\nmodels 1 - 4, it is remarkable that model [10] reproduces\naccurately power losses P0 for all the voltages V0 and tests\nlisted in Table 1. (The calculated P0 curves are close to those\nshown in Fig. 2).\nIn connection with modeling ZS losses above and due to\nthe fact that losses P0 are often not measured in ZS tests,\n102526 VOLUME 7, 2019\nJ. zhaoet al.: Topological Transient Models of Three-Phase, Three-Legged Transformer\nFIGURE 15. Lumped parameters model [10] extended to three-winding\ntransformer.\nFIGURE 16. ZS impedances calculated with model [10] fitted to point 4.\nit was also interesting to simplify the L0R0 model [10] by\nomitting resistances R0. (This model will be referred to as\nthe L0 model). To keep the same ZS impedance, inductance\nL0 of such a model should be taken approximately 6% less\nthan that in the original L0R0 model. A detail comparison of\nL0 and L0R0 models has not revealed any visible difference\nin their SC and inrush currents for YNyn, YNynd, and Yynd\nwinding connections. The difference of 5% was found only\nfor Yyn transformer.\nA maximum difference of 12% was found between inrush\ncurrent results predicted by models L0R0 and L0, on the one\nhand, and corresponding currents in Table 3 calculated with\nthe lumped-distributed models 1 - 4. An even smaller, three\npercent difference between current peaks predicted by these\nmodels was observed on a 300 kV A Yyn distribution trans-\nformer studied experimentally in [22] and modeled in [20].\nSimilar maximum difference (9%) was found in SC cur-\nrents. Taking into account associated uncertainties in the\nnetwork parameters, these differences should be considered\nacceptable in these regimes.\nThe large difference between the reactive power Q pre-\ndicted by model [10] and models 1 – 4 (see Table 4) can be\nexplained by the fact that in the lumped parameter model [10],\nthere is no subdivision of the ZS ﬂux between the ﬂux\nreturning through the tank and the one closing in air/oil.\nBesides, in contrast to models 1 to 4, no parameters of the\ntank wall (its thickness, height, material properties) is used in\nmodel [10]. As a result, the maximum ﬂux density in the legs\n(Bm), reached at GIC condition, is lower than that predicted\nwith models 1 – 4.\nAs can be seen in Table 4, there is a correlation between\nBm and the value of Q. Whereas the value of Bm reached in\nthis 3L transformer does not exceed 2.044 T, its value in the\nequivalent 5L transformer reaches 2.111 T at the same GIC.\nIn the oversaturated region, this difference is very large and\ndetermines the difference between 3L and 5L transformers\nunder GIC conditions.\nVII. CONCLUDING REMARKS\nWe have studied transient topological models of a\nthree-legged core type transformer, which take into account\nthe tank walls considered as a distributed parameter struc-\nture. Processes in the walls are described by Cauer circuits\n(hysteretic and anhysteretic), which represent a tank wall\nbelt (TWB) that is a zone of maximum circumferential eddy-\ncurrents encircling simultaneously all three wound legs. The\nlatter distinguishes the models developed from other simu-\nlation tools, in which each core leg has individual ﬁctitious\ntank with no possibility of studying processes in the tank wall\ndepth.\nModel 1 studied in the paper is that in [5], in which the\nheight of the TWB was taken equal to the height of the\ncore window or 60% of the tank wall height. Although this\nmodel replicates accurately all possible zero-sequence (ZS)\nimpedances of the three-winding transformer, it was found\nthat it yields about 2/3 of the power loss P0 measured in the\nZS tests HOO and LOO speciﬁed in Table 1.\nIt is remarkable that almost the same underestimate in P0\nwas observed in model 2, in which the TWB height was\nincreased to 95% of the tank height.\nTo explore whether it is necessary to reproduce accurately\nthe ZS loss P0 obtained in the measurement of ZS magne-\ntizing impedances, i.e. in the HOO and LOO tests, we have\nimproved the models 1 and 2 by introducing eddy-current\nresistors Rloss into each of them. The thus obtained mod-\nels 3 and 4 have eliminated the 30-35 percent underesti-\nmates of the ZS loss P0, while keeping the accuracy in ZS\nimpedances.\nIt was shown that the introduction of Rloss does not lead to\nnoticeable changes in the model behavior during inrush and\nVOLUME 7, 2019 102527\nJ. zhaoet al.: Topological Transient Models of Three-Phase, Three-Legged Transformer\nshort circuit events, but requires an increase in inductance LT\nof the models (see Table 2) that changes the model behavior\nunder GIC. On the other hand, as could be expected from\nalmost dc ﬂux in the tank under a large GIC, the presence of\nthe eddy-current Rloss has no effecton modeling GIC inﬂu-\nence. So, resistor Rloss can be omitted under GIC conditions\nin models 3 and 4 while keeping remaining model parameters.\nThis leads to the conclusion that models 1 and 2, which\nhave no Rloss, may be used irrespective of the transformer\noperation, despite their underestimate of ZS losses P0.\nSimilar to current peaks, the absence of Rloss and hence\nunderstated ZS losses shown by models 1 and 2 have no\nnoticeable inﬂuence on the decay of the inrush current when\ncomparing these models with models 3 and 4 and with the\nconventional lumped parameters model in [10]. The latter can\nbe used in its original L0R0 form or in the form with only\ninductances L0 employed in many models.\nThe only marked difference between the models 1 to 4 and\nmodel in [10] was found in modeling GIC inﬂuence. The\nreason is that no tank parameters can be accounted in [10].\nOn the contrary, the height of the TWB can be used as a ﬁtting\nparameter in the models 1 to 4 in the presence of GIC.\nTo pre-empt possible questions about ﬁnding Rloss from\nMaxwell equations, it should be emphasized that the models\nconsidered are essentially circuital. So the detailed evaluation\nof Rloss as well as resistors R0 in [10] (see Fig. 15 above)\nis hardly possible within any circuital modeling. These ele-\nments can only be found using the measured data. On the\nother hand, we have shown a negligible role of Rloss and R0\nin modeling inrush currents and short circuit faults. The eval-\nuation of the models under GIC conditions requires reliable\nexperimental data.\nTherefore, it can be concluded that the models proposed\nin the paper are topological models that reproduce accurately\ntransformer behavior under both positive- and zero-sequence\nexcitations. They can be used to explain transformer opera-\ntion details under abnormal conditions and evaluate applica-\nbility of simpliﬁed low-frequency transformer models.\nREFERENCES\n[1] F. de León, P.
