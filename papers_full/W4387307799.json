  "abstract": "Since its release at the end of 2022, the social response to ChatGPT, a large language model (LLM), has been huge, as it has revolutionized the way we communicate with computers. This review was performed to describe the technical background of LLMs and to provide a review of the current literature on LLMs in the field of oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMS). The PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched for LLMs and OMS. Adjacent surgical disciplines were included to cover the entire literature, and records from Google Scholar and medRxiv were added. Out of the 57 records identified, 37 were included; 31 (84%) were related to GPT-3.5, four (11%) to GPT-4, and two (5%) to both. Current research on LLMs is mainly limited to research and scientific writing, patient information/communication, and medical education. Classic OMS diseases are underrepresented. The current literature related to LLMs in OMS has a limited evidence level. There is a need to investigate the use of LLMs scientifically and systematically in the core areas of OMS. Although LLMs are likely to add value outside the operating room, the use of LLMs raises ethical and medical regulatory issues that must first be addressed.",
