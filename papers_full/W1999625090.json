Observing\nindividual particles can be very informative by capturing rare\nevents and returning the distribution of a given variable rather\nthan the ensemble average. All SPT experiments require data\ncollection, particle detection and linking of their positions in\nsubsequent frames. Connecting corresponding particle images in\nsuccessive frames is no trivial task, and consequently numerous\nstudies have focused on developing tracking algorithms which can\ndeal with situations such as fluorophore blinking, focal drift, and\nthe merging or splitting of trajectories [7–9].\nOnce trajectories are identified, the number of mobile\npopulations present in the experimental data and the distribution\nof a suitable quantity describing the motion, such as the diffusion\ncoefficient needs to be determined. Although the theory under-\nlying Brownian motion and thus the diffusion of membrane\nproteins is well-established mathematically [10], in practice the\ninterpretation and extraction of biological information is often\nchallenging [11,12]. In particular, trajectory lengths can be limited\ndue to photobleaching when minimally-invasive labels such as dye-\nconjugated Fab fragments of an antibody or ligands are used.\nWhile there are many analysis strategies for long trajectories, there\nis currently a need for a robust analysis of short trajectories\nobtained from these experiments.\nDiffusion coefficients are typically obtained by plotting the\nmean-square displacement (MSD) for a given time lagDt as a\nfunction ofDt [13–16]. In the case of simple Brownian motion the\ngradient of the curve is proportional to the diffusion coefficientD.\nTo reduce statistical scatter the MSD is best calculated as the\naverage over all points separated byDt within a trajectory (Fig. 1,\nb) [10]. The advantage of the MSD analysis it that individual\ndiffusion coefficients are obtained for each trajectory of a given\nensemble. However, averaging over an entire trajectory can\nobscure transitions between different types of motion [11]. An\nMSD analysis is particularly inaccurate if the length of individual\ntrajectories is short because the time lag becomes a substantial\nfraction of the trajectory. Saxton showed that if a short range\ndiffusion coefficient is calculated from short trajectories (,32 steps)\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 May 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e64287\nthe distribution of D is so wide that measurements of D can\nbecome useless [17,18].\nFor systems for which short trajectories and motion changes are\nexpected an alternative way to analyze the particles’ motion has\nbeen employed, referred to as jump-distance (JD) analysis [19–25].\nHere, the probability of a particle traveling a specific distance\nwithin a set time interval is evaluated and fitted by a theoretically-\nderived probability distribution (Fig. 1,c). The main benefit of this\napproach is that subpopulations of particles with a different\nprobability distribution for their jumps can be easily accounted for\nby extending the analytical expression used to fit the distribution to\nmultiple populations with distinct values ofD and fractions. The\ndrawback of this analysis is the loss of single-trajectory informa-\ntion; instead, a singleD for an ensemble of trajectories with the\nsame mobility is obtained.\nIn this work we have compared both commonly-used method-\nologies to test their performance under realistic experimental\nconditions. We first used simulations to test for which particle\ndensities a local nearest-neighbor based tracking algorithm gives\nsatisfactory results. We then went on to compare MSD and JD\nanalysis, and found that for one diffusing population both return\naccurate D-values if the mean displacement is large compared to\nthe localization precision (relative errors between 3% and 5%). In\ncontrast to the MSD analysis, the JD analysis also yields accurate\ndiffusion coefficients with small relative errors (6% and 5%\nrespectively) for heterogeneous population of diffusing species and\ntrajectory-inherent motion changes. Finally, we apply the JD\nanalysis to the trajectories of endogenous lipopolysaccharide (LPS)\nreceptors in the plasma membrane of mouse macrophages.\nPrevious studies have found these receptors to be partially\nimmobile. Our results demonstrate that the JD analysis is able\nto dissect two diffusing populations. Furthermore, this analysis\nenables us to detect that the motion of the mobile fraction is\nslowed down by Methyl-b-cyclodextrin (MbCD) and is unaffected\nby the disruption of the actin cytoskeleton.\nFigure 1. Principle of the mean-square displacement (MSD) and jump distance (JD) analyses.(a) A typical single trajectory of receptor-\nbound LPS recorded in live macrophages (Dt = 33 ms). Trajectory data can be analyzed either by MSD or JD analysis. For MSD analysis, an average of\nthe mean-square displacement is calculated over all points of the individual trajectory for multiples of the smallest resolved time intervals (Dt, 2Dt,\n3Dt etc). The MSD plot overnDt is linear and the gradient is directly proportional to the diffusion coefficient.(b) Diffusion coefficients are obtained for\nall single trajectories and typically presented in histograms. For a random walk with a single diffusion coefficient and long trajectories this distribution\nis centered around the diffusion coefficient. Multiple mobility populations can be resolved in principle, however a reliable dissection requires afairly\nlarge data set (Note S3 in File S1). The JD analysis plots a histogram of all particle displacements within a fixed time intervalDt for all trajectories.(c)\nFitting Eq. 7 to the distribution of the displacements yields the minimum number of diffusion coefficients needed to describe the motion of the\nparticles in the system.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0064287.g001\nA Comparison of Single-Dye Tracking Analysis Tools\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 May 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e64287\nMaterials and Methods\nMonte Carlo Simulations\nCode written in MATLAB (R 2011b, The MathWorks, Natick,\nMA) was used to generate simulated data. First, we created a high\nresolution matrix containing the initial, noise-free particle start\npositions to generate well separated spots with a given minimum\nnearest neighbor distance. Then, particle positions in subsequent\nframes were simulated according to a full continuum model as\ndescribed in [26]. Briefly, the step size or jump distancer a particle\nwas moved in the subsequent frame was a random variable chosen\nfrom the two-dimensional Brownian probability distribution [25],\n[27]\npr\n2,Dt\n/C0/C1\ndr2~ 1\n4DDt e{ r2\n4DDt dr2, ð1Þ\nwith D being the diffusion coefficient and Dt the time interval\nbetween frames. The angle of jump h was another random\nvariable between 0 and 2p, and the particle was moved dx = r\ncos(h)i n x- and dy = r sin(h)i n y-direction, respectively. The\ntrajectory lengthl was set to 30 image frames similar to the typical\nl obtained from experimental data (Table 1). Since objects viewed\nthrough a microscope are distorted by the point spread function of\nthe objective, we convolved the high-resolution matrix with a\nGaussian point spread function of a 1.5-pixel radius resembling\nreal data. Next, typical background and Poissonian and Gaussian\nnoise was added to mimic typical EM-CCD signals. For the\nsimulation of two populations, two probability functions with\ndifferent D-values ( D\nm(Ground Truth, GT) = 0.1 mm2/s,\nDim(GT) = 0.02mm2/s) were used. If trajectories with an internal\nmotion change were simulated, a motion change would occur\neither once or twice within a trajectory, and the new motion would\nlast for at least 5 frames.\nSingle Particle Tracking and Trajectory Analysis\nCustom-written MATLAB code was used to detect simulated or\nreal particles in each image frame, determine their positions with\nsub-pixel accuracy, and subsequently link the extracted particle\npositions using an implementation based on the work by Crocker\nand Grier [28]. For a detailed description see Note S1 and Fig. S5\nin File S1. Obtained trajectories were analyzed using either an\nMSD or a JD analysis: For the MSD analysis, the mean-square\ndisplacement over the first 5 time intervals was calculated and\nindividual diffusion coefficients obtained, using the linear rela-\ntionship between MSD andDt. For the JD analysis, the distances\nbetween subsequent frames, the so-called jump distances, were\nanalyzed and diffusion coefficients of particle ensembles were\nobtained by curve fitting [20,21].\nMean-square displacement (MSD) analysis. MSD-values\nwere calculated for each individual track xiðÞ ,y(i)fg using the\nmethod described by Qian et al. [10] and Saxton [17] where\nMSD(nDt) for a given time lagnDt is defined as the average over all\npoints with that time lag\nMSD(nDt)~ 1\nl{n\nPl{n\ni~1\nxi znðÞ {xiðÞ½/C138 2z yi znðÞ {yiðÞ½/C138 2, ð2Þ\nwith l denoting the trajectory length andDt the time step between\nframes.

The gradient\nof the linear fit is proportional to D. A histogram of individual D-\nvalues is obtained and the mean value,D. used to characterize\nthe motion of the ensemble.\nJump Distance (JD) Analysis. The probability p(r2,Dt)dr2\nthat a particle starting atr1 = 0 will be encountered within a shell\nof radius r and a widthdr at time Dt is given for two-dimensional\nBrownian motion by [25], [27]:\npr 2,Dt\n/C0/C1\ndr2~ 1\n4DDt e{ r2\n4DDt dr2: ð4Þ\nThis probability distribution can be obtained experimentally by\ncounting the jump distances within intervals [r,r+dr] traveled by\nsingle particles in Dt.

If a systematic deviation is\nobserved m should be increased and a more complex model fitted\nto the data, and the simplest model whose fit result shows no\nsystematic deviation should be chosen [25,30,31].\nCell Culture Procedures\nThe mouse macrophage cell lineRAW 264.7 (ATCC TIB-71,\nEuropean Tissue Culture Collection) was cultured and maintained\nin RPMI (Invitrogen) containing 1% penicillin/streptomycin (100\ntimes, Invitrogen), 1% L-Glutamine (200 mM, Invitrogen) and\n10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Thermo-\nScientific) in an incubator at 5% CO\n2 and 37uC. Cells were grown\nto 60–70% confluence before splitting. Mechanical force was used\nfor their detachment, and after every fourth passage the cells were\ntransferred to a fresh culture flask (BioGreiner).\nSample Preparation for Microscopy\nLPS purified from E. coli and labeled with AlexaFluor 488\n(Invitrogen) was stored at 220uC at a stock concentration of\n1 mg/ml. The labeled LPS was tested with respect to TLR4\nactivation in HEK cells transfected with human TLR4, MD-2 and\nCD14, and found to activate cells to a similar extent to unlabeled\nLPS (Note S5 and Fig. S9 in File S1). RAW 264.7 cells were\nseeded on 48-well plates (UpCell plates, NUNC) at a density of\n6610\n5 cells per well in culture medium and stimulated 24 hours\nlater. Prior to cell stimulation, LPS aliquots were sonicated in two\n30-second bursts separated by a 1-minute pause. Cells were then\nincubated on the plate in medium containing LPS at 1.8\nmg/ml for\n15 minutes on ice. For some experiments the cells were pretreated\nwith 10 mM Methyl-b-cyclodextrin in RPMI supplemented with\n0.5% FCS and 1% L-Glutamine for 2 hours, or with 2.5\nmM\nlatrunculin B (Biomol International, Exeter, UK) in serum free\nmedium for 20 minutes.\nFollowing incubation with LPS, cells were then taken off the\nplate by aspiration, and washed 3 times with ice cold RPMI and\nthe cells recovered by centrifugation (600 g, 2 min, 4uC). The cell\npellet was resuspended in RPMI supplemented with 1% FCS, and\ndropped onto a cover slip housed in a home-made chamber (total\nvolume of medium: 1 mL RPMI/1% FCS), pre-warmed to 37uC\nfor imaging. The microscope coverslips had been cleaned for 10\nminutes with Argon plasma (PDC-002, Harrick Plasma, Ithaca\nN.Y.). A stage incubator was used to maintain temperature and\nCO\n2 content (37uC, 5% CO2) throughout the entire measure-\nments and all data were taken within the first 20 minutes.\nTIRFM Experimental Setup\nImaging was performed using total internal reflection fluores-\ncence microscopy (TIRFM). A diode laser operating at 488 nm\n(PC13589, Spectra Physics) was directed into a TIRF objective\n(606 Plan Apo TIRF, NA 1.45, Nikon) mounted on a Nikon\nEclipse TE2000-U microscope off the optical axis so that it\nimpinged on the sample above the critical angle. Fluorescence\ncollected by the same objective was separated from the returning\nTIR beam by a dichroic (FF500/646-Di1, Semrock), and filtered\nusing Dual-View\nTM (Photometrics) mounted filters. The images\nwere recorded on an EMCCD camera (Cascade II: 512,\nPhotometrics) operating at 270uC. Data were acquired at the\nrate of 28.6 frames s\n21 using Micromanager [32], and the pixel\nsize of the camera was 106 nm. For each treatment, we collected\napprox. 1300 trajectories in three independent experiments which\nlasted an average length of 23 frames.\nResults and Discussion\nTesting of Nearest-neighbor Tracking Function\nOne key step in SPT - connecting particle images in a sequence\nof frames - is complicated by high particle density. If the particle\ndensity is sufficiently low, frame-to-frame particle correspondence\nis almost unambiguous. At these low densities, tracking functions\nbased on a local nearest-neighbor approach have been used\nextensively [15,28,33,34], yet to date there has been no systematic\ntest of the performance of such an algorithm as a function of\nparticle density under realistic conditions. The density of a sample\ncan be characterized by the average nearest neighbor distancea\nbetween particles. Linking particles into trajectories over time is\nfeasible if the average particle displacement d within the time\ninterval Dt is sufficiently smaller thana (d,,a). In that case, a\ntracking function based on a nearest-neighbor approach is\nexpected to perform well. Ford < a, particle assignment becomes\nambiguous because the distance between some nearest-neighbors\nis smaller than their average displacement between frames. The\nratio a/d of a data set can thus be used to test whether a nearest\nneighbor approach is applicable.\nTherefore, in order to test the performance of the nearest-\nneighbor approach implemented by Crocker and Grier [28] with\nvarying a/d, we simulated data with a signal/noise ratio (SNR) and\na trajectory length l matching experimental data (l = 30 steps,\nSNR = 6). In the first image frame particles were located at a\ndefined distance and moved a distanced according to equation (1).\nSince the detection efficiency for isolated particles is 100% for\nSNR-values .3 (Note S2 and Fig. S6 in File S1), the fraction of\ndetected particles only slightly depends ona/d (Fig. 2, black curve).\nThe slight drop towards low a/d values (large d) is due to the\nprobability that two particles get close together ifd is large. Then\ntheir point spread functions overlap and both particles cannot be\nresolved. The fraction of fully reconstructed trajectories (Fig. 2,\nblue curve), however, is affected more strongly; the reconstruction\nrequires every single particle position to be detected and linked\ncorrectly.

Fora/d ,10, computation-\nally more expensive algorithms should be used instead [7,9].\nA Comparison of Single-Dye Tracking Analysis Tools\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 May 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e64287\nComputer Simulations Determine the Accuracy of JD and\nMSD Analysis Under Real Experimental Conditions\nIn order to compare the JD to the MSD analysis, we tested the\nperformance of both methods depending on b, with b being\ndefined as the ratio of two experimentally accessible parameters:\nthe average particle displacementd and the particle’s localization\nprecision s (b =d /s). The measurement of the distanced a particle\nhas traveled within a given time intervalDt( Dt = Dt\nexposure+Dtdelay)\nbecomes inaccurate if s is a substantial fraction of this distance\n(Fig. 3). It is expected that the JD approach is sensitive to b,\nbecause for the JD approach the localization precision directly\naffects the jump distance measurement. Furthermore, the JD\napproach is not sensitive to the trajectory length, because its\nperformance depends on- the overall number of correctly linked\nparticles. The MSD analysis, on the other hand, is less dependent\non b and the trajectory length is expected to be a critical\nparameter, since the MSD(Dt) is obtained as an average of all\nMSD(Dt) over the entire trajectory [10]. As short trajectories are\ntypically obtained in single-dye tracking experiments, we were\ninterested to investigate in which regime of b the JD analysis\nprovides equivalent results to the MSD analysis. To this end,\nimage stacks with particles undergoing Brownian motion were\nsimulated with an SNR, a particle density and a short trajectory\nlength close to experimentally obtained values (Movies S1 and S2).\nWe started with the most trivial case in which only one mobility\npopulation with a diffusion coefficient D\nm(ground truth,\nGT) = 0.1mm2/s was simulated. We variedDtdelay to cover values\nof b ranging from 3 to 12. Trajectories were obtained from the\nsimulated data using the described spot detection and tracking\nfunction, and the diffusion coefficient D\nm(output) extracted using\neither the JD or MSD approach. Then, the relative error\nDDm\nDm\n~ Dm,output{Dm,GT\n/C0/C1\nDm,GT\nof the output diffusion coefficient was compared for both methods.\nFig. 4 a shows that for the case of one mobile population, the JD\nanalysis reconstructs the diffusion coefficient as accurately as the\nMSD analysis if b exceeds a value of 6 (relative errorsDDm/Dm\nbetween 3% and 5%, Fig. S7 b,c and Note S3 in File S1 for\nrepresentative data and fits).\nDifferent Mobility Modes and Motion Changes can be\nReliably Dissected by JD Analysis\nIn the case of one mobility population, the JD is as accurate as\nthe MSD analysis if b.6. However, real receptor motion is\nexpected to be less homogenous due to the organization of the\nplasma membrane: in a mosaic-like membrane receptors are\nexpected to move in a heterogeneous fashion, sub-populations\nwith varying diffusion coefficients may exist and transitions\nbetween different types of motion may occur on the time scales\nof the particle tracking [36,37]. To test the performance of both\ntrajectory analyses under more realistic conditions, two mobility\npopulations undergoing Brownian motion were simulated as\nabove. 50% of the particles belonged to a mobile species\n(Dm(GT) = 0.1mm2/s) and 50% to an immobile species\n(Dim(GT) = 0.02mm2/s). For b.6 the JD analysis yields a relative\nerror inDm of approximately 6% whereas the MSD analysis fails to\nreconstruct Dm reliably (DDm/Dm < 40% for all b, Fig. 4 b).\nAdditionally, the JD analysis reliably extracts the fractions\nfm(GT) = 0.5 of the mobile population, with relative errors offm\nbetween 4% and 8% (Fig. 4c). We also tested how a change in the\nmobile fraction fm (constant b) affected both the JD and MSD\nanalysis (Fig. S1 in File S1). Not surprisingly, the relative error in\nDm for the MSD analysis increased drastically for an increasingly\nsmaller mobile fraction fm whereas the JD analysis still returns\nreliable values forDm. We would like to add that theoretically two\npopulations are resolvable by the MSD approach since the\nhistograms of the diffusion coefficients (Fig. 1b) should show two\npeaks representing two different D-values. However, under the\nconditions examined mimicking typical diffusion data properties,\nthe obtained histograms show that the distributions of D-values are\ntoo wide (due to short trajectories) to resolve the peaks for a typical\ndata set of 750 trajectories (Fig. S7d and Note S3 in File S1). The\nJD analysis, however, already performs well for a data set of this\nsize.\nNext, simulations were used to compare the performance of\nboth approaches with half of the particles undergoing motion\nFigure 2.

The dependence ofDDm/\nDm on b shows the same tendency as for the case of two discrete\nmobile and immobile populations discussed above. For b.5, the\nJD approach recovered Dm with a relative error of approx. 5%,\nwhereas the MSD approach gave a higher relative error (DDm/\nDm.18%, Fig. 4 d). Changing the fraction of the particles\nundergoing a motion change (constantb) affected both the JD and\nMSD analysis. We found that if more than 30% of the particles\nundergo a motion change, the JD analysis outperforms the MSD\nanalysis (Fig. S2 in File S1).\nPerformance for Experimental Data: Native CD14 and\nTLR4 Organization\nInvestigating the motion of endogenous cell surface receptors is\nchallenging but also rewarding as the receptors can be studied in a\nminimally-perturbed and thus more relevant environment. Two\nreceptors of particular interest are CD14 and Toll-like Receptor 4\n(TLR4). Both play a fundamental role in generating an immune\nresponse against infection by recognizing LPS, a component of the\nGram-negative bacterial cell wall [38]. Over-activation of TLR4\nby Gram-negative bacteria can lead to sepsis, making antagonism\nof this receptor an important therapeutic goal [39]. TLR4\ndimerization is known to be required for activation of signaling\npathways; however how LPS-bound CD14 and TLR4 behave\nwithin the cell membrane is unclear.\nTherefore we decided to visualize endogenous CD14 and TLR4\nreceptor motion by using fluorescently labeled LPS (AlexaFluor\n488, see Movies S3 and S4 for representative data). Since LPS did\nnot bind to CD142/2 macrophages (Fig. S3 in File S1), we\nassume that the detected LPS molecules are either bound to CD14\nor TLR4 after transfer via CD14. First we characterized all data\nsets to be confident that our tracking and JD analysis algorithms\nwould be applicable (measuring the SNR, localization precision,\naverage nearest neighbor distance andb, Table 1). Furthermore,\nvisual inspection of the data revealed motion changes (a\nrepresentative trajectory is shown in Fig. S4 in File S1), indicating\nthat an MSD analysis would not be appropriate. This is in\nagreement with a previous study [40] of TLR4 receptor diffusion\nusing FRAP which have also found that a fraction of TLR4\nreceptors is immobile.\nThe JD distribution revealed that there are at least two\npopulations with different mobility modes present (Fig. 5 a, b,\nTable 1), as fitting the data assuming one population fails. These\ntwo populations are unlikely to correspond directly to the two\nFigure 4. Comparison of JD analysis and MSD analysis on simulated data.Simulations with varying mobile and immobile populations were\nused to compare the performance of the JD analysis(black curves) to the standard MSD approach(red curves).

The faster-moving particles\n(two-thirds of the receptors) moved with a diffusion coefficient of\nD\nm = (0.1460.02) mm2/s, all other particles were immobile within\nour localization precision (Note S4, Fig. S8 in File S1).\nIn previous work it was found that treatment with the\ncompound MbCD used to extract the cholesterol from the plasma\nmembrane slows down the motion of glycophosphatidylinositol-\n(GPI-)anchored receptors by a factor of two [42]. We thus probed\nwhether MbCD had a similar effect on LPS receptor motion since\nCD14 is also a GPI-anchored protein [43]. For macrophages\npretreated with MbCD two populations with different mobility\nmodes were recovered, and the immobile fraction measured for\ncholesterol depleted cells was similar to the control sample, see\nFig. 5 c and Table 1. The diffusion coefficient of the faster\npopulation dropped by 50% for treated cells to a value of\nD\nm = (0.0760.02) mm2/s which is in excellent agreement with the\nstudy by Vrljic et al. [42]. However, this result is seemingly in\ndisagreement with the expected change in membrane fluidity upon\ntreatment with MbCD, as the membrane should be more fluid in\nthe absence of cholesterol and thus the receptor motion should be\nfaster. Therefore we assume that the observed reduction in\nreceptor mobility after MbCD treatment is due to a previously\nreported side effect of the drug: MbCD was found to strengthen\nthe adhesion of the cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane [44]\nwhich explains the reduced receptor mobility. Thus, the effect of\nMbCD on cytoskeletal organization dominates the effect of\ncholesterol depletion, and hence it should not be used to\ninvestigate whether the lipid composition is of importance for\nreceptor organization and signaling. Instead, membrane choles-\nterol levels could be manipulated by metabolic inhibition using\ncompounds such as compactin [45].\nFinally we also investigated the effect of the underlying\ncytoskeleton on receptor motion by treating the cells with\nlatrunculin B, a drug which is commonly used to depolymerise\nthe actin cytoskeleton. Interestingly, receptor diffusion was found\nto be unaffected by this treatment (D\nm = 0.1460.01 mm2/s, Fig. 5d\nand Table 1). As CD14 is a GPI-anchored protein, this fits\nprevious observations that some actin disruption agents such as\nCytochalasin D do not influence the motion of GPI-anchored\nproteins [42].\nConclusion\nIn this study we have investigated how information on particle\ndiffusion can be reliably extracted from short single-dye trajecto-\nries. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we have shown that a\nnearest-neighbor approach leads to a successful reconstruction of\nthe trajectories if the average nearest neighbor distancea is $10\ntimes the average displacementd.I fa/d ,10, a different tracking\napproach should be chosen [46], and its suitability tested by\nsimulations or the plateau region criterion suggested by Wieser\net al [47]. Ensuring reliable trajectory formation is particularly\nimportant if the density of the molecule of interest cannot be\nvaried experimentally, for instance if the diffusional behavior of\nendogenous receptors is investigated.\nIf short trajectories of one diffusing population are analyzed,\nand if the localization precision is not a substantial fraction of the\nparticles’ mean displacement (b.6), we have demonstrated that\nboth MSD and JD analysis yield accurate D-values (DD/D =3 –\n5%). For two populations with different D-values, or a population\nswitching between two D-values, the MSD analysis fails to\nreconstruct the D-values reliably whereas the JD analysis yields\naccurate D-values (DD/D < 6% for b.6). In both latter cases, a\ncomplete reconstruction of trajectories is crucial for the accuracy\nof a MSD analysis whereas the accuracy of a JD analysis is less\naffected by failures in particle linking (falsely linked particles\ncontribute one false step size to the histogram as opposed to a false\nD-value of an entire trajectory). A JD analysis can therefore be\nadvantageous in an experimental situation for which false particle\nlinks cannot be completely avoided due to high receptor densities.\nWe suggest that the JD analysis should be used for an initial\nanalysis of experimental data if the underlying number of diffusion\npopulations is unknown. Even if receptor diffusion can be\ndescribed using a single D-value, the labeling method, e.g. using\nfluorophore-tagged antibodies or ligands, can introduce artificial\nmotion changes if the off-rate of the antibody or ligand cannot be\nneglected during the experiment.\nWe have chosen a sample size and mean trajectory length\ntypically obtained for single dye tracking studies. In general, a JD\nanalysis improves with the number of correctly linked particles\nwhich could be achieved either by longer trajectories or a larger\nsample size. For a single population, JD and MSD approach are\nexpected to yield similar results forb.6 even if the sample size\nand trajectory length is increased. For trajectory length longer\nthan 100 frames (which is hard to achieve for single-dye tracking),\nwe would recommend a MSD approach as it has the potential to\nextract additional information [11]. For two populations a\nsignificant increase of the sample size is required to distinguish\nmotion modes reliably with an MSD analysis forb.6. An approx.\nFigure 5.

The residual shows no systematic\ndeviation of the fit from the data. Note that the deviation of the fit from\nthe histogram towards larger displacements is also found in our\nsimulated data (Fig. S7 and Note S3 in File S1) and thus does not\nindicate a deviation of the data from Brownian motion.

In the case of\nmotion changes within a particle trajectory, a JD approach is\nbeneficial for b.6, independent of trajectory length and sample\nsize, as MSD analysis obscures motion changes.\nFinally we applied the JD analysis to analyze the motion of\nsingle-dye labeled endogenous LPS receptors and found that these\nreceptors are partially immobile. While the motion of the mobile\nfraction is slowed down by M bCD, it is unaffected by the\ndisruption of the actin cytoskeleton.\nIt is our hope that the principles established in this work will\nhelp to guide other researchers in their choice of analysis method\nfor single-dye tracking data and thereby ultimately contribute to a\nmore detailed understanding of membrane protein organization.\nThe MATLAB code for simulations and analysis software is\navailable upon request, contact L.W.
