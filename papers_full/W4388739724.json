  "abstract": "&lt;abstract&gt; &lt;p&gt;The field of neuroscience has been significantly impacted by the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly language models like ChatGPT. ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, is a powerful conversational AI tool with the ability to communicate in multiple languages and process vast amounts of data. The commentary explores the significant impact of ChatGPT on the field of neuroscience, emphasizing its potential contributions, challenges, and ethical considerations. ChatGPT has shown promise in various aspects of neuroscience research, including hypothesis generation, data analysis, literature review, collaboration, and education. However, it is not without limitations, particularly in terms of accuracy, potential bias, and ethical concerns. The commentary highlights the potential applications of ChatGPT in the context of child and adolescent mental health, where it could revolutionize assessment and treatment processes. By analyzing text from young patients, ChatGPT can identify patterns related to mental health issues, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning. It can also improve communication between patients and healthcare professionals, offering real-time insights and educational resources. While ChatGPT presents exciting opportunities, the commentary acknowledges the need for careful oversight and control to address privacy concerns, biases, and potential misuse. Ethical considerations surrounding the model's impact on emotions, behavior, and biases require ongoing scrutiny and safeguards. In conclusion, ChatGPT offers transformative potential in neuroscience and mental health, but it must be harnessed responsibly, with a focus on ethical considerations and scientific rigor to ensure its positive impact on research and clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/abstract&gt;",
