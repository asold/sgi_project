INTRODUCTION\nSince Tretyakov et al. and Pendry predicted theoretically that a chiral route can be used in order to\nobtain negative refraction [1, 2], the chirality concept in metamaterials (MMs) has attracted signiﬁcant\nattention. Chiral metamaterials (CMMs) is a subset of MMs, which have no symmetric planes and are\nnot identical to their mirror images, and also neither violates reciprocity nor time-reversal symmetry,\nleading to cross-coupling between the electric and magnetic ﬁelds [3]. CMMs are of great current interest\nboth for customized functionalities and for potential applications not found in natural medium arise\nfrom the magneto-electric cross coupling of chiral structures due to their lack of any mirror symmetry.\nAs a fact, besides negative refractive index, CMMs can also achieve other exotic EM characteristics,\nsuch as giant gyrotropy [4], strong polarization rotation (giant optical activity) [5–11], circular polarizer\n(circular dichroism, CD eﬀect) [12–15], asymmetric transmission (AT) eﬀect [16–21], linear or/to circular\npolarization conversion [22–32], and even the prospect of a repulsive Casimir force [33, 34] by special\nenantiomeric forms or similar chiral structure design. The cross-coupling is original physics of these\nspecial electromagnetic (EM) properties [35, 36].\nManipulating polarization state of EM waves or light is critical for a wide range of applications,\nsuch as liquid crystal display, wireless communications, optical data storage and so on [36, 37]. Thus,\nthe eﬀective manipulation of EM wave polarization is highly desirable [21]. Compared with conventional\nmedia or method [38, 39], CMMs has some advantages to realize the manipulating polarization, such as\nhigh polarization conversion eﬃciency and operation frequency can be scaled to diﬀerent EM spectrum\ndue to the geometry scalability. Based on this, there have been many eﬀorts tending toward the\nrealization of the CMMs in manipulating the polarization states of EM wave [12–31] with high eﬃciency.\nReceived 5 February 2014, Accepted 4 March 2014, Scheduled 1 April 2014\n* Corresponding author: Yan Nie (nieyan@hust.edu.cn).\n1 School of Optical and Electronic Information, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430074, China.2 School of\nElectronic and Information Engineering, Hubei University of Science and Technology, Xianning 437100, China.\n264 Cheng et al.\nRecently, a set of circular polarizers (giant CD eﬀect) [12–15, 22–32] and pure linear polarization rotators\nor transformers with AT eﬀect [16–21] using helix structure, asymmetric U-shaped SRR pair, planar\nspiral structure, and twisted split ring resonators (SRRs), more concentric rings and other asymmetric\nchiral structures have been intensively reported. Among them, all these chiral structures could be\navailable to tailor the cross coupling between electric and magnetic ﬁelds, which can achieve a giant\nCD eﬀect or optical activity or circular conversion dichroism. It means that the conversion of diﬀerent\npolarization states of EM waves can be realized by these CMMs, such as linear to linear [16–21, 27, 31, 32],\nlinear to circular [22–28, 31, 32], and circular to circular [30]. However, only a single-polarization state\ncan be obtained for the above mentioned CMMs with the same unit-cell structure.\nMore recently, Ma et al. [32] proposed a double-layer twisted Y shape structure that achieves\nobvious CD eﬀect and giant optical rotation at diﬀerent frequencies simultaneously. However, only one\nkind of circularly polarized waves can be transformed by such CMM with the realization of 90◦ linear\npolarization rotation. In this work, we designed a simple asymmetric CMM using bi-layer twisted split-\nring structure. The experimental results are in good agreement with the numerical simulation. When\na y-polarized EM wave is incident on the proposed sample propagating along backward (−z) direction,\nit is found that nearly pure left and right circularly and cross-polarized wave with AT eﬀect can be\nobtained in transmission simultaneously at diﬀerent resonance frequencies. Induced surface current and\nelectrical ﬁeld distributions are investigated to clarify the mechanism of the polarization transformation.\nThe proposed CMM has simple geometry but more functionality in diﬀerent operating frequency bands\nthan the previous designs [12–32], and can be used in applications such as antenna radome, remote\nsensors and radiometer, polarization spectral ﬁlter [40–42].\n2. PHYSICAL MODEL, SIMULATION AND EXPERIMENT\nFigures 1(a) and (b) show the photograph of a portion of a fabricated CMM sample and schematics of\nunit-cell structure, which consists of double-layered copper structure patterned on opposite sides of an\nFR-4 board. With the purpose of giant chirality and AT eﬀect, the mirror symmetry breaking along the\npropagation direction is the unique route, which enables the lack of structural mirror symmetry [27].\nThe single-layer planar structure design proposed here is similar to those in [43, 44]; however, it is\ndistinguished in that double split and bi-layer asymmetry are introduced to tailor the cross-coupling\n(a) (b)\n(c)\nFigure 1. (a) Photograph of a portion of the fabricated sample, (b) perspective view of the unit cell\nstructure, (c) schematic of the transmission coeﬃcients measurement.\nProgress In Electromagnetics Research, Vol. 145, 2014 265\nbetween electric and magnetic ﬁelds, which can modify the transmission for they-polarization normal\nincident wave. As shown in Figure 1(b), for the unit cell structure, the front SRR is rotated 90◦\nwith respect to the back one. This unit cell can be repeated to create a layer that can function as\na polarizer. Moreover, for a perfect or nearly diodelike AT eﬀect of linearly polarized waves, the one\ntransmission of the two oﬀ-diagonal (cross-polarized) components of the Jones matrix (txy or tyx) should\nbe enhanced, and all the others (tyx or txy, txx, tyy) should be suppressed signiﬁcantly. As a result,\ndiodelike transmission with strong asymmetry takes place for the incident waves which are linearly\npolarized in thex or y directions [19].\nWe will demonstrate numerically and experimentally our proposed CMMs for the dual-band circular\npolarizer and linear polarization transformation with strong AT eﬀect. For the proposed asymmetric\nCMMs as shown in Figures 1(a) and (b), the relative dielectric constant of the FR-4 board is 4.2\nwith a dielectric loss tangent of 0.015, and the metallic structure layers in both sides were modeled\nas a 0.035 mm copper ﬁlm with an electric conductivityσ = 5.8 × 107 S/m. The optimal geometry\nparameters are as follow:p = 10 mm,a = 8 mm,w = 1 mm,g = 1.5 mm,t = 1.5 mm. The numerical\nsimulations were performed based on the standard ﬁnite diﬀerence time domain (FDTD) method by\nusing the frequency domain solver of the CST Microwave Studio. In the process of simulation, the\nperiodic boundary conditions were applied to thex and y directions, while perfectly matched layers\nwere applied to thez direction.\nFor experiments, the designed structures are fabricated into a 20× 20 unit cell sample (10 mm×\n10 mm× 1.57 mm) by the conventional printed circuit board (PCB) process, and the photograph of a\nportion of a fabricated CMM sample is shown in Figure 1(a). The sample was measured through free-\nspace EM transmission measurement in a microwave anechoic chamber. Agilent PNA-X N5244A vector\nnetwork analyzer connected to the two standard gain broadband linearly polarized horn antennae was\nemployed to measure the CMM sample in an EM anechoic chamber. The schematic of the transmission\ncoeﬃcients measurement is shown in Figure 1(c). Both antennas own VSWR< 2, and they face each\nother with a distance of 1 m over a wide frequency range of 4 to 16 GHz to eliminate the near-ﬁeld\neﬀect. In the measurements, the time-domain gating strategy was used to eliminate the undesirable\nrepetitively reﬂected EM waves [27]. A linearly polarized EM wave (E ﬁeld in thex or y) direction\nis incident on the CMM structure sample propagating along−z(+z) direction. Four diﬀerent linear\ntransmission coeﬃcients could be obtained by rotating the received antennae. Then the linear-to-circular\nand circular-to-circular transmission coeﬃcients can be calculated from the transformation equations\ndescribed in [25, 27, 28] in detail.\n3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nFigures 2(a) and (b) show the simulated and measured linear transmission coeﬃcients and phase\ndiﬀerence ϕy between co- and cross-polarizations for the backward propagation iny polarization. A\ngood agreement between simulation and measurement can be observed across the entire frequency\nrange. The electric response for the normally incidentx-polarized wave distinguishes from that for\nthe y-polarized wave due to the structure’s lack of C4 symmetry [27]. In this particular design, the\ngiant CD eﬀect and good performances for the circular polarizer are only valid for the (x)y polarization\nincident ﬁeld propagating along +z(−z) direction. From Figure 2(a), three simulation (measurement)\nresonant peaks (dips) are obviously observed aroundf1 = 5.36(5.32) GHz,f2 = 6.65(6.6) GHz and\nf3 = 10.47(10.52) GHz from the co- and cross-polarization transmission coeﬃcientstyy and txy. Note\nthat there are a slight frequency shift between simulation and measurement curves, and the possible\nreasons for this shift can include: (1) the diﬀerence of the EM parameters (e.g., permittivity) of the\ndielectric substrate, (2) the small diﬀerences in substrate and metal thicknesses, and (3) the ﬁnite size\neﬀects also should be considered. Numerical and experimental results both indicate that the peak\nvalues of cross-polarization transmission coeﬃcientstxy reach at least 0.5 for three resonant bands.\nThus, the high transformation eﬃciency can be unambiguously demonstrated. The amplitudes oftyy\nand txy are nearly the same, and the ratio (|txy|/|tyy|) nearly achieve unity around resonances (f1 and\nf2), respectively. At the third resonant frequency (f3), the simulation (measurement) amplitude of\nco-polarization transmission coeﬃcientstyy decreases to the minimum value of 0.032(0.074), while the\ntxy is up to the maximum value of 0.878(0.917). In addition, as shown in Figure 2(b), phase diﬀerence\n266 Cheng et al.\n(a) (b)\nFigure 2. Simulated and measured results for the designed CMM: (a) linear transmission coeﬃcients\nfor the backward propagation iny polarization, (b) phase diﬀerenceϕy between txy and tyy.\n(a) (b)\nFigure 3. Simulated and measured (a) linear to circular transmission coeﬃcients, (b) polarization\nextinction ration (PER).\nϕy is about 90◦, −90◦, and 180◦ around above three resonant frequency points. These results suggest\nthat nearly pure circular polarization waves with diﬀerent handedness are emitted around two lower\nresonances (f1 and f2), and most of the incidenty-polarized wave is transformed into thex-polarized\nor experienced nearly 90◦ polarization rotation around higher frequency (f3) after they-polarized wave\npassing through the designed CMMs slab propagating along backward (−z) direction. It should be\nnoted that three resonances could also be obtained around the same frequencies for incidentx-polarized\nwave propagation−z direction, but its cross-polarization transmissiontyx is much lower than the co-\npolarization txx (not shown), thus the transmitted waves are elliptical polarization.\nFigures 3(a) and (b) show the numerical and experimental RCP and LCP emitted wave transmission\ncoeﬃcients calculated from the two linear wave transmission coeﬃcients using the transformation\nequations described in detail in [25]. There are signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the transmission of RCP\nand LCP waves around the resonances (f1 and f2) due to the asymmetric chiral structure along the\npropagating direction. From Figure 3(a), numerical (experimental) results indicate that the transmitted\nLCP wave reaches a minimum value of−23.1(−22.5) dB at 5.36(5.32) GHz while the RCP wave reaches\na minimum value of −25.3(−26.9) dB at 6.65(6.61) GHz. At two lower frequencies (f1 and f2), it\ncan also be seen that the transmission coeﬃcients of the RCP and LCP wave are−5.8(−5.6) dB and\n−2.5(−2.5) dB, respectively. As shown in Figure 3(b), the large polarization extinction ratios (PER) of\n16.1(16.8) dB and−21.1(−23.8) dB can be observed, which indicates the pronounced CD eﬀect at the\nabove two frequencies. It means that the incidenty-polarized (x-polarized) along the−z(+z) directions\nwave can be converted well to the transmitted nearly pure RCP and LCP waves around the resonances\nProgress In Electromagnetics Research, Vol. 145, 2014 267\n(a) (b)\nFigure 4. Simulated and measured (a) ellipticity (η) and (b) polarization azimuth rotation angle (θ)\nfor the backward (−z) propagation iny polarization.\n(f1 and f2) after passing through the CMMs slab.\nThe functionality of dual-band circular polarizer (giant CD eﬀect) and linear polarization\ntransformer (giant optical rotation) of the proposed asymmetric CMMs can be clearly demonstrated\nthrough the analysis of ellipticity (η) and the polarization rotation angle (θ) described in detail in [3, 25].\nFigures 4(a) and (b) display the ellipticity (η) and polarization azimuth rotation angle (θ) for they\npolarization incidence propagating along backward (−z) direction. From Figure 4(a), one can see\nthat the simulation (experiment) peak value ofηy is about 35.1◦(36.2◦) and −41.9◦(−44.2◦) at lower\nfrequency resonances (f1 and f2), respectively, for they-polarized incident wave, further conﬁrming\na near pure RCP wave and LCP wave emissions. Moreover, the polarization azimuth rotation angles\ncan be observed asθy = −43.7◦(−43.4◦) and −93.2◦(−93.7◦) with respect to the incident linearlyy-\npolarized wave whenηy = 0◦ at 6.0 GHz andf3 = 10.47(10.52) GHz, revealing a huge optical activity.\nIt can be imagined that the major polarization axis of the emitted wave fory polarization incidence\nundergoes clockwise rotation rapidly towardx axis (−90◦), then reaches a negative maximum value\nof −93.2◦(−93.7◦) at 10.47(10.52) GHz, and ﬁnally rotates counterclockwise rapidly back toy axis,\nwhich is similar to the results of [18, 20, 27]. These results conﬁrm that nearly pure circularly polarized\nwaves with diﬀerent handedness and near 90◦ rotation linearly polarized wave are realized at two lower\nfrequencies (f1 and f2) and higher frequency (f3) for the designed CMM slab, respectively. Thus, this\nCMMs slab can be functioned as a simultaneous circular and linear polarizer at diﬀerent resonances.\nIn recent years, the AT eﬀect for linear polarization is unusual and appealing polarization\nfunctionalities studied due to their potential application, such as optical isolator and circulators [16–21].\nAccording to above results, we can conjecture that the designed structure also function as AT eﬀect for\nlinear polarization only around the third resonance (f3). In the next section, we will focus on AT eﬀect\nof the third resonance of the designed structure. To validate this point, the AT parameters for linear\nand circular polarization bases were calculated [20, 21], and the corresponding results are depicted in\nFigures 5(a) and (b). It can be clearly seen that the parameter ∆y(x)\nlin for linear polarization reaches a\npositive maximum value of 0.742(0.807) while it has a negative minimum value of−0.742(−0.807) at\nthe third frequency of 10.47(10.52) GHz, which is very comparable with previous results [16, 18, 20, 21].\nHowever, due to the speciﬁc asymmetry in the structure, there is almost zero asymmetric transmission\nfor either the RCP or LCP waves across the whole frequency range.\nDue to the large AT parameter for the linear polarization of the proposed structure, the total\ntransmission of each linearly polarized wave for bothx- andy-polarized incidence waves is quite diﬀerent\nalong opposite directions [18, 27]. To verify this point, total transmissionTx of emitted x-polarized\nwave for both x- and y-polarized incidences along the forward (+z) and backward (−z) directions\nthrough the structure are shown in Figure 6(a), where the simulation is in reasonable agreement with\nmeasurement. It can be observed that the backward total transmissionTx reaches peak values of\n0.773(0.851) at 10.51(10.68) GHz while the forward total transmission approaches a minimum values\nof 0.018(0.023) at 10.65(10.72) GHz. Thus, the substantially diﬀerent total transmissions along the\n268 Cheng et al.\n(a) (b)\nFigure 5.(a) Simulated and (b) measured AT parameter ∆ for linear and circular polarization bases.\n(a) (b)\nFigure 6. Simulated and experimental results of (a) total transmission of emittedx-polarized wave\nfor both x-polarized and y-polarized incidence along the forward (+z) and backward (−z) directions\nthrough the structure, and (b) asymmetry factor (∆Tlin).\ntwo opposite directions indicate a strong asymmetric factor ∆Tlin of linear polarization transmission\nwave, as shown in Figure 6(b). It can also be seen that the asymmetric factor ∆Tlin reaches peak\nvalues of 0.724(0.814) at 10.68(10.72) GHz, which reveals a nearly diodelike AT eﬀect. However, for the\nachievement of perfect diodelike AT eﬀect, thetxx ≈ 0, tyx ≈ 0, tyy ≈ 0, andtxy ≈ 1 must be achieved\nfor backward propagation, which will lead to ∆Tlin ≈ 1. Note that the asymmetry factor is strongly\ndependent on the incident polarization and has its maximum for thex- andy-polarized waves [19].\nIntrinsically, the giant CD eﬀect and asymmetric optical activity for diﬀerent polarizations mainly\noriginate from the interlayer near-ﬁeld coupling between two twisted layers [35, 36]. Thus, the resonant\npolarization conversion can be tailored by the EM coupling. Around these resonant frequencies, all the\nﬁeld patterns will be twisted inside the slab as a consequence of interlayer coupling [20, 21]. Surface\ncurrent distributions are studied in the unit-cell of CMMs to observe the coupling between the electric\nand magnetic ﬁelds, as shown in Figures 7(a), (b) and (c). From Figures 7(a) and (b), similar to the\nresults of [15, 28], the currents on the front and back SRRs are in the same direction at the ﬁrst frequency\n(5.36 GHz), and the antiparallel current exists on the top and bottom layers of the structure at the second\nfrequency (6.65 GHz), which are symmetric resonance mode as coupled electric dipoles resonance and\nasymmetric resonance mode as coupled magnetic dipoles, respectively. Thus, the fundamental electric\nresonance mode of the ﬁrst SRR can be excited eﬃciently, and the near-ﬁeld coupling between the ﬁrst\nand second SRRs results in a emitted RCP and LCP wave at resonances, respectively. From Figure 7(c),\nat 10.47 GHz, the case is complex and complete, and stronger antiparallel current only exists on the\nProgress In Electromagnetics Research, Vol. 145, 2014 269\nup, down and left branches of the chiral structure, which will cause the induced magnetic ﬁelds mainly\nparallel toy-direction. Then the electric ﬁeld alongx-direction would be excited by the magnetic ﬁeld,\nresulting in the cross-polarization transmission for they-polarized incident wave propagating along−z\ndirection.\nTaking a further step, the evolution of electric ﬁelds in they-z plane of the middle of unit-cell\nstructure including incoming regime, substrate and the outgoing regime is also investigated to provide\na direct, intuitionistic witness and understanding of the resonant polarization conversion, as shown\nin Figures 7(d), (e) and (f). From Figures 7(d) and (e), at 5.36 GHz and 6.65 GHz, after the same\ny-polarized incident wave passing through the structure propagating along−z direction, the electric\nﬁelds of outgoing wave will twist to right and left directions, respectively. As shown in Figure 7(f), at\n10.47 GHz, it can be seen clearly that the electric ﬁeld of outgoing wave is along−x direction. It can\nalso be conjectured that the 90% of ﬁeld strength of incoming wave withy-polarization is transformed\nto the outgoing wave withx-polarization, coinciding well with the observed cross-coupled transmitted\ncoeﬃcients. These electric ﬁeld evolution pictures are excellently consistent with the calculated results\nof the polarization azimuth rotation angle and ellipticity.\n(a) (b) (c)\n(d) (e) (f)\nFigure 7.The simulation results of the surface currents distributions and electric ﬁelds for the proposed\nCMMs in the case ofy-polarized incident wave propagating along−z direction: (a) and (d) RCP wave\nat f1 = 5.36 GHz, (b) and (e) LCP wave atf2 = 6.65 GHz, (c) and (f) 90◦ linear polarization rotation\nwave at f3 = 10.47 GHz. The solid (dashed) line arrows represent the front (back) surface current\ndirection.\n4. CONCLUSION\nIn summary, an asymmetric CMMs composed of bi-layer twisted SRR structure was proposed and\ncomprehensively characterized by simulation and experiment. The numerical simulation is in good\nagreement with the measured results, which reveals that the giant CD eﬀect for circular polarized wave\nemissions with dual bands and linear polarization transformation with near diodelike AT eﬀect can be\nobtained simultaneously from linearly polarized incident wave at microwave frequencies. The interlayer\nnear-ﬁeld coupling between two twisted layers of this design has been further illustrated by simulated\nsurface current distributions and electric ﬁelds. In addition, if the dimensions are reduced to micro-,\nnano- and even lower scale, the operation frequency of the proposed CMM can also be scaled to other\nEM spectrums, such as millimeter wave, terahertz, or even optical range. The proposed CMM structure\ncould also be beneﬁcial in designing optical functional materials, such as polarization spectral ﬁlter,\ncircular polarizer, optical isolator and circulators.\n270 Cheng et al.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThis work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant\nNo. 51207060, and in part by the foundation for Chinese Scholarship Council (CSC, No. 201306160039).\nREFERENCES\n1.
