So, it may be difﬁcult\nfor students and researchers to obtain a comprehensive overview\nof tool use impairments after left brain damage. The major aim\nof this paper is to ﬁll this gap by providing a synthesis of experi-\nmental results over the last 30 years. This will lead us to address\ntwo crucial issues: (1) The role of mechanical knowledge in tool\nuse, which has received growing attention in recent years; (2) The\ncognitive processes supporting the most widely employed task,\nnamely, pantomime of tool use.\nBefore discussing these issues directly, let us specify which\nstudies are eligible for inclusion in the present review. Apraxia\ncovers a wide range of disorders (e.g., constructive apraxia, gait\napraxia, apraxia of speech, dressing apraxia) as well as sev-\neral types of gestures (tool use, symbolic and meaningless ges-\ntures). However, we will only emphasize tool use impairment.\nBesides, the historical ideomotor/ideational apraxia dichotomy\nhas been argued to be confusing, reﬂecting either a task-based\nor a process-based distinction (e.g., Hermsdörfer et al., 2006;\nOsiurak et al., 2011; Lesourd et al., 2013a ). Therefore, for the\nsake of clarity, we decided not to use this dissociation to select\nstudies.\nTOOL USE ASSESSMENT\nApraxia of tool use can be assessed in at least four ways depending\non the amount of information given to patients.\nPANTOMIME OF TOOL USE\nCritical to this task is that patients are asked to demonstrate the\nuse of tools without holding them in hand. The input modal-\nity may vary (visual presentation of the tool, verbal command,\nimitation) and the examiner may provide more or less infor-\nmation as to the name of the tool, its function, its usual cor-\nresponding object\n1 or the necessity of imagining holding the\ntool in hand. Imitation tasks can be performed without refer-\nring to tool knowledge, as in imitation of meaningless pos-\ntures ( Della Sala et al., 2006 ;s e ea l s oGoldenberg, 1995, 1999;\nGoldenberg and Hagmann, 1997). Therefore, we did not con-\nsider results about imitation and we only included studies on\npantomime of tool use on visual presentation and/or to verbal\ncommand.\n1We shall use the terms tool and object to refer to the implement perform-\ning the action (e.g., screwdriver) and the recipient of the action (e.g., screw),\nrespectively.\nwww.frontiersin.org M a y2 0 1 4|V o l u m e5|A r t i c l e4 7 3| 1\n\nBaumard et al. T ool use after brain damage\nSINGLE TOOL USE\nSingle tool use consists in demonstrating the use of a tool while\nholding it in hand but without the usual, corresponding object.\nContrary to pantomimes, the tactile input is present, suggesting\nthat patients do not need to form a mental representation of the\ntool. Additional information may be provided (name of the tool,\nthe action or the goal of the action) but, for our purpose, we did\nnot take these criteria into account.\nREAL TOOL USE\nIn this task, patients are asked to actually use tools with the\nusual, corresponding object. We distinguished between two con-\nditions (no-choice versus choice). In the no-choice condition,\npatients are presented with only the tool and its corresponding\nobject. In the choice condition, several tools and objects are given.\nTwo criteria can be found in the literature, namely, the pres-\nence/absence of tools/objects not useful for the action to be done\n(i.e., distractors) or the presence/absence of a sequence of at least\ntwo actions involving more than two tools/objects (i.e., multiple\nobject task). This latter condition can be viewed as a choice condi-\ntion since each time an action is performed with two tools/objects\n(e.g., striking the match on the matchbox), the remaining\ntools/objects (e.g., the candle) become distractors for this speciﬁc\naction.\nMECHANICAL PROBLEM SOLVING\nThese tasks require using novel tools in order to solve an unfa-\nmiliar tool use situation (e.g., extracting a target from a box or\nlifting a cylinder). The solution can be found out from the mere\nobservation of the device, perhaps without adopting trial-and-\nerror strategy. This covers situations wherein familiar tools have\nto be used in a non-conventional way (e.g., screwing a screw with\na knife). As for real tool use, two conditions exist: choice (i.e.,\nselection of the correct tools among an array of novel tools) and\nno-choice (i.e., only the correct, novel tool is present).\nTHEORETICAL BACKGROUND\nIt is commonly assumed that tool use is supported by two sys-\ntems: The conceptual and the production system. The role of the\nconceptual system is to form a mental, tool action representation.\nT h r e ek i n d so fk n o w l e d g eh a v eb e e np r o p o s e di nt h el i t e r a t u r e .\nThe ﬁrst one corresponds to semantic knowledge about tool func-\ntion, which contains information about the usual relationship\nbetween a familiar tool and its corresponding object or the con-\ntext wherein it can be used (e.g., a hammer is commonly used\nwith a nail and can be found in a workshop; Roy and Square,\n1985; Rothi et al., 1991; Buxbaum, 2001 ) .I no t h e rw o r d s ,i tr e f e r s\nto allocentric relationships (i.e., tool-object), and is associated\nwith left anterior, temporal lobe lesions ( Hodges et al., 2000;\nGoldenberg and Spatt, 2009; Goldenberg, 2013a ).\nSecond, sensorimotor knowledge about tool manipulation\ncomprises information about the movements associated with the\nusual manipulation of a speciﬁc tool (e.g., the use of a hammer\nrequires ample elbow oscillations; Rothi et al., 1991; Buxbaum,\n2001). So, contrary to semantic knowledge, sensorimotor knowl-\nedge is supposed to encode egocentric relationships (i.e., tool-\nuser). Damage to the left inferior parietal lobe might impair this\nkind of knowledge (e.g., Buxbaum and Saffran, 2002; Buxbaum\nand Kalénine, 2010; Kalénine et al., 2013 ).\nThird, mechanical knowledge provides information about\nrelationships between the physical properties of tools and objects\n(e.g., hammering requires that the hammer is heavier than the\nnail; Goldenberg and Hagmann, 1998b; Goldenberg and Spatt,\n2009; Osiurak et al., 2010, 2011, 2013; Osiurak, 2014 ). This kind\nof knowledge refers to allocentric relationships (i.e., tool-object)\nand might be also supported by the left inferior parietal lobe\n(Goldenberg and Spatt, 2009 ).\nThe role of the production system is to generate a speciﬁc\nmovement pattern by taking into account both the environmen-\ntal constraints and the tool action representation built by the\nconceptual system (for discussion, see Osiurak, 2013a,b ). The\ndorsal stream would be the neural basis of this production system\n(Heilman et al., 1986; Buxbaum, 2001; Binkofski and Buxbaum,\n2013).\nThe aforementioned kinds of knowledge have been suggested\nto be differentially involved depending on the given task (pan-\ntomime of tool use, single tool use, real tool use, mechanical\nproblem solving). Special attention has to be paid to pantomime\nof tool use given that it might be grounded on processes that\nare not tool-speciﬁc. Indeed, the most widespread interpretation\nof impaired performance in this task stresses damage to sensori-\nmotor knowledge (i.e., the sensorimotor knowledge hypothesis;\nHeilman et al., 1982; Buxbaum et al., 2005 ). However, it has also\nbeen hypothesized that it is a non-routine, creative task requiring\nworking memory in order to temporarily maintain information\nabout how the tool has to be held in hand and should be used\nwith the corresponding, absent object (i.e., the working memory\nhypothesis; Roy and Hall, 1992; Bartolo et al., 2003 ). At last, pan-\ntomime of tool use has been assumed to be nothing else but a kind\nof symbolic gesture (i.e., the symbolic hypothesis; Goldenberg\net al., 2003 ). In this view, the demonstration by pantomime would\naim to communicate the idea of the action rather than to attempt\nto reproduce the gesture strictly speaking. We shall return to these\nthree hypotheses in more detail below.\nMETHODS\nThe purpose of the present paper was to review the experimen-\ntal data published on pantomime of tool use, single tool use, real\ntool use and mechanical problem solving since 1985 (i.e., the year\nRoy and Square published the conception-production model).\nT o this end, several databases (i.e., PubMed, ScienceDirect, Eric,\nFrancis, PBSC, Psycarticles, Web of Knowledge) were searched in\n2013–2014 for the following keywords: “tool use,” “object use,”\n“apraxia,” “limb apraxia,” “ideational apraxia,” “apraxia of tool\nuse,” and “stroke,” “left brain damage,” “left hemisphere.”\nSELECTION OF PAPERS\nOnly English language experimental studies were included. They\nhad to meet the following criteria:\n(1) Presence of right-handed patients with lesions conﬁned to the\nleft hemisphere. Studies were not included if they involved\nhealthy subjects only or if they investigated disconnection\nsyndromes.\nFrontiers in Psychology| Cognition M a y2 0 1 4|V o l u m e5|A r t i c l e4 7 3| 2\nBaumard et al. T ool use after brain damage\n(2) Presence of a control groupconsisting of healthy subjects or at\nleast non-neurological patients.\n(3) Administration of at least one of the four critical tasks(i.e.,\npantomime of tool use, single tool use, real tool use, mechan-\nical problem solving). Pantomime tasks had to be made of\n“pure” pantomime items, without other types of items such\nas symbolic gestures (e.g., waving goodbye). Besides, tasks\nwere considered as mechanical problem solving tasks only if\npatients had to hold a tool to use with an object, and only if\nit could be achieved through inference rather than trial and\nerror, so as to be comparable with other tool use tasks.\n(4) Administration on verbal command, visual presentation or tac-\ntile input. Even though the aforementioned tasks can be\nadministered on imitation, we did not consider this modal-\nity because imitation is not supposed to be accounted for\nby semantic knowledge about tool function, sensorimotor\nknowledge about tool manipulation or mechanical knowl-\nedge (see Roy and Square, 1985; Rothi et al., 1991 ). Moreover,\nthere is no consistent correlation between production of sym-\nbolic gestures on verbal command and on imitation ( Heath\net al., 2001 ). Therefore, we focused on verbal, visual and tac-\ntile presentation of tools or objects. It is noteworthy that\nwe could have studied modality effects, but we did not do\nso. Because of methodological heterogeneity in the ﬁeld of\napraxia, this would have led us to generate too many cate-\ngories with very few studies for each modality, preventing us\nfrom drawing ﬁrm conclusions.\n(5) Availability of quantitative behavioral datafor both patients\nand controls, allowing us to convert mean performance lev-\nels into percentages, and to contrast them. Frequency of\nimpairment among patients, z-scores, number of errors, and\nkinematic data were not taken into account. Finally, we\nexcluded “redundant” studies (i.e., studies whose data had\nalready been published) for it would have exaggerated some\nresults.\nOur keywords led us to create a corpus of 176 studies. Only 36\nout of 176 studies ﬁtted our criteria (see Figure 1). In this pool\nwe counted 59 different tasks, considering that several studies\nincluded more than one relevant task. Regarding our criteria,\ntool use is frequently assessed through pantomime of tool use\n(25/36, 69%) whereas single tool use (12/36, 33%), real tool use\n(14/36, 39%) and especially mechanical problem solving (8/36,\n22%) were only occasionally investigated over the last 30 years.\nThis can be explained by a lack of consensus in this ﬁeld (see\nDovern et al., 2012 ).\nDATA EXTRACTION\nIn many papers only apraxic left-brain damaged (LBD) patients\nare included, most often on the basis of imitation or pantomime\ntasks. However, although some manifestations of apraxia are\nmore prevalent following left rather than right hemisphere lesions\n(Goldenberg, 2009 ), this is not the case for real tool use and nat-\nuralistic actions ( Schwartz et al., 1999; Hartmann et al., 2005;\nRumiati, 2005). We did not select these studies because our pur-\npose was to analyze the consequences of left-brain-damage, rather\nthan apraxia, on tool use. Indeed, if we did so, this would have\nled us to follow a pointless, circular reasoning, namely, apraxic\npatients are apraxic. Nevertheless, we reviewed these studies if\nthey secondarily included non-apraxic LBD patients. In this case,\nwe calculated the mean performance of apraxic and non-apraxic\nLBD patients (by taking into consideration, of course, the num-\nber of patients in each category). We acknowledge that this may\nbe a bias since it does not display the performances of consecutive\npatients. However we believe it reﬂects the state of literature, and\nit prevented us from eliminating too many relevant studies.\nDATA ANALYSIS\nIn order to make data from these 36 studies comparable, we\nconverted mean performances and standard deviations into per-\ncentages. Then, we calculated the mean performance level for\neach task, weighted by sample sizes. Furthermore, for each study,\nwe computed the difference between controls’ scores minus LBD\npatients’ scores (for a similar method, see Lesourd et al., 2013a,b ).\nThis procedure appears suitable for several reasons. First, given\nthe low number of studies available and methodological hetero-\ngeneity, it was not relevant to conduct a meta-analysis. Second,\nthe performances of control subjects can vary between studies,\ntherefore focusing on differences rather than raw scores avoids\na bias when comparing papers. At last, this procedure expresses\nthe severity of the impairment in each task, which is a good way\nto determine whether different tasks call upon similar or differ-\nent cognitive mechanisms (e.g., a difference of 50% in one task\nand 10% in another may lead us to infer divergent cognitive\nFIGURE 1 | Repartition of the 36 studies included in the present review over time.\nwww.frontiersin.org M a y2 0 1 4|V o l u m e5|A r t i c l e4 7 3| 3\nBaumard et al. T ool use after brain damage\ndemands). However, results from this procedure have to be taken\nwith caution in light of the high frequency of ceiling effects in\ncontrol groups, which can artiﬁcially reduce the difference to\npatients.\nRESULTS\nCOMPARISONS BASED ON WEIGHTED MEANS\nAs can be seen in Ta b l e 1, performance of LBD patients is lower\nfor pantomime of tool use than for single and real tool use (mean\nscores 66, 78, 84%, respectively; range 34–88, 68–100, 72–100),\nwith the two latter producing similar results at ﬁrst sight.

Circles in bold are non-signiﬁcant differ-\nences. Circle surfaces express sample sizes and curves were drawn\nfor the only two studies that investigated all of the four tasks\n(Heilman et al., 1997; Jarry et al., 2013 ).\nAt ﬁrst sight, there is more discrepancy between studies con-\ncerning pantomime of tool use, and there is a gradient from\npantomime of tool use (mean difference 25%, range 6–52) to\nreal tool use (mean 13%, range 0–28) with single tool use being\nintermediary (mean 17%, range 0–28). Actually, the ﬁrst is sys-\ntematically more difﬁcult than the two latter if we focus on studies\nin which at least two tasks were administered (i.e., colored circles\nin Figure 2).\nSecond, this gradient is less obvious between single and real\ntool use. Although previous studies found no signiﬁcant asso-\nciation between these tasks ( Butler, 2002; Bickerton et al., 2012 ;\nsee also Riddoch et al., 1989 ), only two studies investigated both\nof these tasks in respect of our criteria: According to Jarry et al.\n(2013), both of them are equally difﬁcult whereas Randerath et al.\n(2011) found real tool use to be much easier. This gap is most\nlikely due to methodological variations since the latter authors\nemployed a very structured task (i.e., patients were assessed with\nonly two items, they did not have to select tools in real tool use\nand they were provided with verbal information about the action\nto be done).\nFinally mechanical problem solving appears to be the most\ndifﬁcult task after pantomime of tool use (mean difference\n18%, range 6–34). More speciﬁcally, the control-patient differ-\nence is almost always greater than in single and/or real tool\nuse. Only one out of eight studies reported the opposite ﬁnding\nin LBD patients with posterior lesions only ( Goldenberg et al.,\n2007). Nevertheless, real tool use and mechanical problem solv-\ning are assessed with a wide array of tasks. In light of these\nresults, it appeared necessary to control for this methodological\ndiscrepancy.\nEFFECT OF CHOICE AND DISTRACTORS IN REAL TOOL USE AND\nMECHANICAL PROBLEM SOLVING\nWe divided data from real tool use and mechanical problem solv-\ning into two categories: In the no-choice condition, patients are\npresented with only one tool and its corresponding object (e.g.,\na match and a matchbox) whereas in the choice condition, they\nare presented with three or more tools/objects (e.g., a match, a\nmatchbox and a candle; also referred as to multiple object tasks).\nWithin this latter condition, studies were also distinguished by\nthe presence/absence of distractors, deﬁned as tools/objects not\nuseful for the task to be done (e.g., a match, a matchbox and\na hammer). Situations in which at least two tasks are presented\nwww.frontiersin.org M a y2 0 1 4|V o l u m e5|A r t i c l e4 7 3| 5\nBaumard et al. T ool use after brain damage\nsimultaneously (e.g., making coffee, ﬁxing a tape recorder) were\njudged to include distractors since tools that are useful for one\ntask are useless for the other.\nAs can be seen in Ta b l e 2and Figure 3, only two studies inves-\ntigated both choice and no choice in both real tool use and\nmechanical problem solving ( Heilman et al., 1997; Jarry et al.,\n2013). Overall, although mechanical problem solving is more dif-\nﬁcult than real tool use, these tasks produce similar results in that\nreducing the number of tools/objects enhances performances in\nboth conditions. The only study that investigated real tool use\n(choice) without distractors ( Neiman et al., 2000 ) found similar\nresults.\nFinally, as shown in Ta b l e 3, pantomime of tool use is more\ndifﬁcult than single tool use, which is more difﬁcult than real\ntool use (no choice), with choice conditions being intermediary\nbetween pantomime of tool use and single tool use. Nevertheless,\nit is noteworthy that even in no choice condition, LBD patients’\nperformance is signiﬁcantly impaired as compared to controls.\nASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN TASKS\nWe intended to determine whether associations can be found\nbetween the tasks of interest. However, given that too few studies\nexplored more than one condition, we only described association\ntendencies. T o this end, we displayed control-patient differences\nfrom each study in which at least two tasks where investigated,\namong pantomime of tool use, single tool use, real tool use and\nmechanical problem solving (see Figure 4).\nAs can be seen, stronger positive associations were found\nbetween pantomime of tool use, real tool use and mechanical\nproblem solving than between single tool use, real tool use and\nmechanical problem solving. A negative association was observed\nbetween single tool use and mechanical problem solving, but this\nobservation has to be taken with caution given that it concerned\nonly two studies. Interestingly, a slight impairment in mechanical\nproblem solving coincides with more substantial impairment in\npantomime of tool use than in real tool use. Furthermore, there\nis a positive association between mechanical problem solving and\npantomime of tool use.\nDISCUSSION\nThe aim of the present paper was to provide an overview of tool\nuse impairments after left brain damage. More precisely, we shall\ndiscuss the role of mechanical knowledge in tool use as well as the\ncognitive mechanisms supporting pantomime of tool use.\nTHE ROLE OF MECHANICAL KNOWLEDGE IN TOOL USE\nThree kinds of conceptual knowledge have been proposed to sup-\nport real tool use: Semantic knowledge about tool function ( Roy\nand Square, 1985; Rothi et al., 1991; Buxbaum, 2001 ), sensori-\nmotor knowledge about tool manipulation ( Rothi et al., 1991;\nBuxbaum, 2001 ) and mechanical knowledge about the physi-\ncal properties of tools and objects ( Goldenberg and Hagmann,\n1998b; Goldenberg and Spatt, 2009; Osiurak et al., 2010, 2011 ).\nWe shall address these hypotheses in turn.\nSemantic knowledge provides individuals with information\nabout the usual relationship between familiar tools and objects\n(e.g., a hammer is usually used with a nail). Therefore, it might\nbe required in at least four situations: When matching pictures of\ntools with the corresponding, usual object (e.g., hammer/nail) or\nthe context in which they can be used (e.g., hammer/workshop);\nwhen it is necessary to select tools/objects to be used together;\nwhen pantomiming the use of tools; and when performing single\ntool use. Indeed, given that objects are not present in the two latter\nsituations, access to semantic knowledge is necessary to produce\nthe right conventional action (e.g., hammering is relevant with\na nail but not with a shoe). Interestingly, patients with semantic\ndementia, who have lost semantic knowledge about tools, have\nbeen demonstrated to perform better in no-choice situations and\nmechanical problem solving, suggesting that these tasks put less\ndemands on functional knowledge ( Hodges et al., 2000; Bozeat\net al., 2002; Silveri and Ciccarelli, 2009 ).\nIn our data, LBD patients perform better in real tool use (no\nchoice; mean control-patient difference 8%, range 0–16) than in\npantomime of tool use (25%, 6–52) and single tool use (17%, 0–\n2 8 ) .I no t h e rw o r d s ,t h em o r ec o n t e x t u a li n f o r m a t i o np a t i e n t s\nreceive, the better they perform. Presumably, this contextual\nadvantage may be a semantic advantage in that the presence of\nobjects in real tool use provides sufﬁcient information and makes\nretrieval from semantic memory unnecessary. Furthermore, the\nchoice condition of real tool use (18%, 9–28) is more difﬁcult\nthan the no-choice condition of real tool use. These results are\nconsistent with the semantic hypothesis. Nevertheless, patients\nstill perform worse than controls in real tool use (no choice) and\nmechanical problem solving (18%, 6–34). As a consequence, dis-\nruption of semantic knowledge accounts for some, but not all, of\ntool use impairments. In other words, this kind of knowledge is\nnot sufﬁcient to support tool use (see also Buxbaum et al., 1997 ).\nSensorimotor knowledge links speciﬁc movements to speciﬁc\ntools (e.g., using a hammer requires ample elbow oscillations).\nThree predictions can be derived from this hypothesis. First, this\nkind of knowledge should be necessary in any task involving the\nproduction of tool-related movements, among which are pan-\ntomime of tool use, single tool use and real tool use. Second,\nchoice situations should not be more difﬁcult than no-choice situ-\nations because the same movement is required in both cases (e.g.,\nhammering does not vary depending on the number of tools on\nthe desk). Third, the loss of sensorimotor knowledge should not\ninterfere in the use of novel tools, such as in mechanical problem\nsolving.\nOur results do not conﬁrm these predictions. Indeed, LBD\npatients are not impaired to a similar extent in pantomime of tool\nuse (25%), single tool use (17%), and real tool use (no-choice,\n8%). Moreover, the choice condition of real tool use is more difﬁ-\ncult than the no-choice condition of real tool use even though this\ndissociation has been assessed in only two studies ( Heilman et al.,\n1997; Jarry et al., 2013 ) and remains to be conﬁrmed. At last, the\nsensorimotor hypothesis does not account for impaired perfor-\nmance of LBD patients in mechanical problem solving. On these\naccounts, experimental data did not prove that apraxia of tool use\nin LBD patients is due to the loss of sensorimotor knowledge.\nFinally, mechanical knowledge about the physical properties\nof tools and objects (e.g., hammering requires that the hammer is\nheavier than the nail) may be necessary to use both familiar and\nnovel tools, and might be supported by the left inferior parietal\nFrontiers in Psychology| Cognition M a y2 0 1 4|V o l u m e5|A r t i c l e4 7 3| 6\nBaumard et al.

So, LBD patients are supposed\nto be concurrently impaired in both of these tasks.\nOverall, our results conﬁrmed this prediction (real tool use,\nmean control-patient difference 13%; mechanical problem solv-\ning: 18%). Moreover, LBD patients are constantly impaired in\nmechanical problem solving and, in studies that investigated both\nconditions, failure to solve mechanical problems was systemati-\ncally associated with failure to use familiar tools ( Heilman et al.,\n1997; Goldenberg and Hagmann, 1998b; Hartmann et al., 2005;\nBartolo et al., 2007; Goldenberg et al., 2007; Osiurak et al., 2009;\nJarry et al., 2013 ). Additionally, as shown in Figure 4,t h e r ei s\na clear positive association between the two tasks. These results\nlead us to suggest that mechanical knowledge is necessary to use\nfamiliar tools and objects.\nT o conclude, experimental data obtained over the last 30 years\nindicate that real tool use might be supported by at least two kinds\nof knowledge, both of them referring to allocentric relationships:\nSemantic knowledge about tool function and mechanical knowl-\nedge. These two types of knowledge might partially compensate\nfor each other, in that studies on semantic dementia already\ndescribed impaired use of familiar tools in the context of pre-\nserved mechanical problem solving ( Hodges et al., 2000; Bozeat\net al., 2002; Silveri and Ciccarelli, 2009 ). However, to our knowl-\nedge, this pattern has never been found in LBD patients. On the\nother hand, the reverse pattern (i.e., impaired, but better perfor-\nmance in real tool use than in mechanical problem solving; see\nTa b l e 1) was frequently observed, suggesting that loss of mechan-\nical knowledge can be partially compensated by intact semantic\nknowledge although it is critical to account for tool use disor-\nders in LBD patients. We shall now discuss the cognitive processes\nunderlying pantomime of tool use.\nTHE COGNITIVE PROCESSES SUPPORTING PANTOMIME OF TOOL USE\nT h r e eh y p o t h e s e sh a v eb e e np r o p o s e dt oe x p l a i nt h ec o g n i t i v e\nbasis of pantomime of tool use: The sensorimotor knowledge\nhypothesis ( Heilman et al., 1982; Buxbaum et al., 2005 ), the\nsymbolic hypothesis ( Goldenberg et al., 2003 ) and the working\nmemory hypothesis ( Roy and Hall, 1992; Bartolo et al., 2003 ).\nAccording to the sensorimotor knowledge hypothesis, pan-\ntomime of tool use requires individuals to implicitly recover\ngesture representations that contain invariant, egocentric rela-\ntionships, and that are speciﬁc to particular tools. Therefore,\nas suggested above, there should be no difference between\nFrontiers in Psychology| Cognition M a y2 0 1 4|V o l u m e5|A r t i c l e4 7 3| 8\nBaumard et al.

Each point\ncorresponds to control-patient differences. Slopes illustrate the degree\nof association.\npantomime of tool use, single tool use and real tool use. Indeed,\nbecause these representations are egocentric and invariant, the\npresence/absence of tools and objects should not modify control-\npatient differences. However, the present review conﬁrmed that\npantomime of tool use is much more difﬁcult than real tool use\n(see also Riddoch et al., 1989; Roy and Hall, 1992; Butler, 2002;\nBartolo et al., 2003; Bickerton et al., 2012 ). Moreover, pantomime\nof tool use seems to be poorly associated with single tool use com-\npared with real tool use and even mechanical problem solving\n(see Figure 4). These results thus do not favor the sensorimotor\nknowledge hypothesis.\nThe symbolic hypothesis assumes that defective pantomime\nof tool use is due to asymbolia, that is, a “general inability to\nexpress concepts by means of learned signs” ( Goldenberg et al.,\n2003). As an example, drawing from memory implies to select\ntypical features of the object to be drawn (e.g., the shape of\nboth the handle and head of a hammer). Presumably, asymbolia\nshould impair any activity that requires access to semantic mem-\nory, such as language, drawing from memory and pantomime of\ntool use (see Goldenberg, 2013b ). Indeed, this hypothesis also\npresumes that pantomimes are part of communicative gestures\nin that they require patients to select distinctive features of the\nsensory appearance of absent tools/objects (e.g., the shape of the\nhandle of a hammer) and to abstract properties that do not con-\ntribute to recognizability (e.g., the color or the material of the\nhandle) in order to produce a canonical, recognizable gesture.\nSo, pantomime of tool use should be more difﬁcult than single\ntool use since in the latter, patients do not need to communi-\ncate the idea of the tool because they already handle it. Our data\nare consistent with this hypothesis: Pantomime of tool use (mean\ncontrol-patient difference 25%) and single tool use (17%) appear\nto be weakly associated and the ﬁrst is consistently more difﬁcult\nthan the latter over studies. Nevertheless, pantomime of tool use is\ncloser to mechanical problem solving than to single tool use (see\nTa b l e 3, Figures 3, 4) and in previous studies, asymbolia alone\ncould not account for pantomime disturbances in LBD patients\n(Goldenberg et al., 2003 ). Further research is thus required on\nthis point.\nIn line with the working memory hypothesis, pantomiming\nthe use of tools leads individuals to form a mental representa-\nt i o no ft h et o o li nh a n d ,t h eo b j e c to nt h ed e s ka n dt h ea c t i o n\nto be performed. Once this layout has been imagined, it has to\nbe maintained in working memory until the gesture is ﬁnished.\nThis implies that holding a tool in hand and/or seeing the object\nprovides cues, hence reducing the degrees of freedom and so the\nnumber of possible errors ( Roy and Hall, 1992; Bartolo et al.,\n2003). As a consequence, the presence of actual tools reduces\nthe load on working memory and enhances performance. The\ngradient we already described is consistent with this hypothesis.\nTo sum up, the present review found the working memory\nhypothesis and, to a lesser extent, the symbolic hypothesis, to\nbe most relevant as regards pantomime of tool use. On the\nother hand, the sensorimotor knowledge hypothesis remains to\nbe demonstrated. Another key ﬁnding is the similar difﬁculty level\nand the relationship between mechanical problem solving and\npantomime of tool use (see Ta b l e 3and Figure 4). Previous stud-\nies reported signiﬁcant correlations between these tasks ( Heilman\net al., 1997; Goldenberg and Hagmann, 1998b; Jarry et al., 2013 ).\nThis ﬁnding is not compatible with cognitive models of apraxia\n(Roy and Square, 1985; Rothi et al., 1991; Buxbaum, 2001 )b u t\nrather suggests that pantomime of tool use is a composite task\nthat may call for mechanical knowledge, in addition with seman-\ntic knowledge and working memory. In fact, this task can be\nviewed as a kind of problem solving for it may require forming\na mental representation through identiﬁcation and combination\nof distinctive features of tools and actions (see Goldenberg et al.,\n2003; Goldenberg, 2009 ) or, put differently, technical means and\ntechnical ends ( Osiurak et al., 2010, 2011 ).\nwww.frontiersin.org M a y2 0 1 4|V o l u m e5|A r t i c l e4 7 3| 9\nBaumard et al.

On the whole, the pres-\nence of numerous tools seems to be a major obstacle to LBD\npatients but not to control subjects. Note that although this ﬁnd-\ning is intuitive, the cognitive models of apraxia ( Roy and Square,\n1985; Rothi et al., 1991; Buxbaum, 2001 ) do not address the issue\nof how humans choose tools and objects. Interestingly, the choice\neffect is true for familiar as well as novel tools and, as a result,\nquestions the relationship between mechanical knowledge and\ntool substitutions. Unfortunately, only one of the selected stud-\nies investigated real tool use (choice) without distractors ( Neiman\net al., 2000 ). Consequently, it remains unknown whether LBD\npatients fail multiple object tasks because of a planning impair-\nment, interference from distractors or inability to select and\ncombine useful/useless tools. Nevertheless, these results remain to\nbe conﬁrmed because ceiling effects prevented us from comput-\ning the real difference between choice and no-choice conditions in\ncontrol group. Therefore, such a difference among patients could\nbe accounted for by the intrinsic difﬁculty of choice conditions.\nFuture research is needed to disentangle the origin of the choice\neffect in LBD patients.\nCONCLUSION\nT o conclude, pantomime of tool use, single tool use, real tool use\nand mechanical problem solving seem to have at least one cogni-\ntive mechanism in common, which may be the ability to retrieve\nmechanical knowledge on the basis of identiﬁcation and combi-\nnation of distinctive features of tools and objects. Nevertheless,\neach task calls for differential demands depending on pres-\nence/absence, familiarity/novelty and number of tools/objects\n(see Ta b l e 4). This theoretical distribution challenges the idea that\ntool use in general, and pantomime of tool use in particular call\nfor sensorimotor knowledge. Note also that data reported here\nfocus on left brain damage but do not exclude a role of the right\nhemisphere in tool use ( Schwartz et al., 1999; Hartmann et al.,\n2005; Rumiati, 2005 ). In sum, although apraxia of tool use is clas-\nsically viewed as a disorder of movement representations/motor\ncontrol, the present review emphasizes that apraxia of tool use\nin LBD patients may be ﬁrst and foremost a cognitive disorder\ninvolving the understanding of how tools and objects have to be\nused together ( Osiurak et al., 2010, 2011; Goldenberg, 2013a ).\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported by grants from ANR (Agence\nNationale pour la Recherche; Project Démences et Utilization\nd’Outils/Dementia and T ool Use, N\n◦ANR 2011 MALZ 006 03),\nand was performed within the framework of the LABEX CORTEX\n(ANR-11-LABX-0042) of Université de Lyon, within the program\n“Investissements d’Avenir” (ANR-11- IDEX-0007) operated by\nthe French National Research Agency (ANR).\nSUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL\nThe Supplementary Material for this article can be found online\nat: http://www .frontiersin.org/journal/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.\n00473/abstract\nREFERENCES\n∗Barbieri, C., and De Renzi, E.
