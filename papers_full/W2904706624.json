The pro-\nposed technique can achieve a smaller cell capacitor size without in-\ncreasing the total device rating (TDR) and degrading the dc current\ncontrol capability. The operation principle of the proposed method\nis presented on an isolated modular multilevel dc–dc converter,\nwhich consists of an MMC stage and applied as a dc transformer\nfor medium-voltage dc grid. The TDR and passive components siz-\ning are derived and compared with those using other modulation\nmethods. Finally a downscaled hardware prototype has been built\nand tested to verify the proposed modulation method.\nIndex T erms —Cell capacitor, dc transformer, modular multi-\nlevel converter (MMC), MVDC, phase-shifted (PS) modulation.\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nT\nHE modular multilevel converter (MMC) has been applied\nto high/medium voltage direct current (HVDC/MVDC)\ngrids [1], [2], medium voltage (MV) motor drive [3], [4], and\ndc transformers for an MVDC system [5], [6]. A phase-shifted\nsinusoidal modulation method is usually adopted for MMC. The\nMMC has many advantages including superior current control\ncapability and no dc link capacitors; however, one demerit of\nMMC is the large cell capacitor size and high total device rat-\ning (TDR). Wang et al. has proposed a method to reduce the\ncell capacitor of MMC by applying a small arm inductance to\nachieve a capacitor charge balance in a switching cycle; how-\never, this method may require a dc link capacitor to decouple the\ngrid impedance effect to maintain a small arm inductance [7].\nAnother method can reduce the MMC cell capacitor size by in-\njecting a second-harmonic component but leads to an increased\nTDR since circulation current becomes larger [8]. In addition,\nthe methods proposed to reduce the MMC cell capacitors may\nnot be the best choice for a dc transformer consisting of an\nMMC stage since a higher ac frequency and more modulation\nfreedoms exist in a dc transformer.\nManuscript received October 22, 2018; accepted November 21, 2018.

In addition, this method can\nachieve a small arm inductance but without requiring a dc link\ncapacitor to decouple the grid impedance effect. This method\nhas been applied to an isolated modular multilevel dc–dc\nconverter (iM2DC) for an MVDC system application, which\nconsists of an MMC stage and a medium frequency (MF)\nac transformer. V arious modulation methodologies have been\nproposed for the MV iM2DC including phase-shifted sinusoidal\nmodulation [9]–[11], two-level (2L) and a quasi-two-level\n(Q2L) modulation [12]–[14], as well as triangular modulation\n[15]. Among these modulation methods, large cell capacitors\nare needed for sinusoidal modulation; triangular modulation, on\nthe other hand, results in a large arm root mean square current\nleading to a higher TDR and conduction loss; a 2L and Q2L\nmodulation can achieve smaller capacitors and TDR but at the\ncost of dc current control capability. With proposed PS-SWM,\nthe MV iM2DC can achieve low passive component size without\nincreasing TDR and degrading dc current control capability.\nThe letter is organized in the following way. In Section II,\nan iM2DC applied for the MVDC system is ﬁrst introduced.\nThe operation principle of the proposed PS-SWM modulation\nis, then, presented on the MMC stage of this MV iM2DC. The\nTDR and the sizing of cell capacitors as well as arm induc-\ntance are also derived in Section II and compared with those\nusing PS sinusoidal and Q2L modulation methods. A down-\nscaled hardware prototype has been built in the laboratory. The\nexperimental waveforms of an MMC stage and an iM2DC are\nprovided in Section III to verify the validity of the proposed\nmodulation method. Finally, the proposed PS-SWM is summa-\nrized in Section IV.\nII. O PERA TIONPRINCIPLES OF PS-SWM\nThe topology of an iM2DC applied as a dc transformer for\nan MVDC system is shown in Fig. 1. It consists of two sides\nintegrating through an MF transformer. One side is connected\nto an MVDC bus. Multiple full-bridge cells or half-bridge cells\nare cascaded within each arm. Distributed cell capacitors are\ninstalled at the dc link of each cell and coupled arm inductors\nare adopted to achieve decoupled dc and ac inductance. Based\non the application requirement, the other side can be connected\n0885-8993 © 2018 IEEE. Translations and content mining are permitted for academic research only.

Topology of an iM2DC consisting of an MMC stage at MVS connected to an MVDC bus.\nto either an HVDC/MVDC bus with similar MMC structure, or a\nlow-voltage dc bus with a 2L converter. The operation principle\nof the proposed PS-SWM will be illustrated on the MMC stage\nof the medium-voltage side (MVS), which is shown in Fig. 1.\nThe modulation waveforms of the proposed PS-SWM strat-\negy as well as the corresponding arm voltages and transformer\nvoltage are shown in Fig. 2. As shown in Fig. 2(a), a square\nwaveform with 0.5 duty cycle is adopted as the modulation\nwaveform, where magnitude M and dc offset d are controllable.\nma(b)p and ma(b)n are the modulation waveforms of phase a\n(b) upper arm and lower arm, respectively. map is the same\nas mbn , which is 180 ° phase-shifted with the man and mbp .\nN is the cell number in one arm, C1 ∼ CN are carrier wave-\nforms with the frequency, which can be as low as twice of the\nmodulation frequency. A phase-shifted angle 2 π/N is applied\namong carriers, which increases the equivalent switching fre-\nquency. Consequently, the square arm voltage and transformer\nvoltage waveforms will be formed with small high-frequency\nwaveforms as shown in the zoomed-in view in Fig. 2(b). A large\nmodulation index, i.e., a large M is desired, since vab can be\nas high as dc bus voltage Vdc , which achieves lowest converter\nTDR. In addition, the highest voltage ripple frequency and low-\nest ripple magnitude occur at the same time on the arm inductor\nvoltage vLa and vLb in this mode, which indicates the smallest\ninductor size can be achieved.\nA staircase or trapezoidal modulation waveform instead of\na square wave can be utilized to reduce the ac voltage dv/dt.\nWhen the staircase level increases, vab has more levels and\nsmaller dv/dt. Fig. 3 depicts the key waveforms of an iM2DC\nwith the proposed modulation method. A 6L staircase wave\nmodulation is applied, which already attains the same ac voltage\nlevel with that of the trapezoidal wave modulation and adequate\nfor a reduced dv/dt performance. The operation principle of a\nsecondary side is similar to that of the primary side, but with\na phase shift angle ϕ to transfer the power. Although the mag-\nnitude of modulation waveform can vary in the secondary side\nas well, usually it equals to that of the primary side modulation\nwaveform to ensure high efﬁciency. Both dc bus current idc and\ntransformer current iac ﬂow though the cells, therefore, the arm\ncurrent contains both dc and ac components as shown in Fig. 3\nusing the primary side phase a arm current iap and ian as ex-\namples. Moreover, the small stair step angle α with acceptable\ndv/dt are preferred, otherwise the dc voltage utilization will be\nsacriﬁced. In this letter, this angle is assumed to be very small,\nsuch that they can be neglected in the following steady state\nanalysis.\nThe TDR and the passive component size of proposed mod-\nulation method can be derived as follows. The arm voltage and\narm current of an MMC stage in Fig. 1 can be written as\n{\nvap = vbn = Vdc\n2 − vab\n2 ,vbp = van = Vdc\n2 + vab\n2\niap = ibn = idc\n2 + iab\n2 ,ibp = ian = idc\n2 − iab\n2 .\n(1)\nIf ignoring the stair step angle and the high- frequency ripples,\nthe ac voltage of an MMC stage can be considered as a pure\nsquare wave as\nvab = Vab · S [θ] ,S [θ]=\n{\n1,θ ∈ [0,π ]\n−1,θ ∈ [π, 2π] (2)\nwhere the magnitude of the ac voltage, Vab , is adjustable with\nthe proposed PS-SWM, which can be deﬁned as\nVab = k · Vdc (3)\nwhere k is the voltage ratio of ac- to- dc. The voltage and current\nstress of each device on an MMC stage is\nvs = Vdc\n2N + Vab\nN ,i s = idc\n2 + iac\n2 . (4)\n6006 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS, VOL. 34, NO. 7, JULY 2019\nFig. 2.

(a) Transformer voltage, current, and arm current.\n(b) Zoomed view of the shaded range in (a).\nBased on (5), the minimal TDR can be accomplished when\nk = 1, i.e, the ac voltage magnitude equals to dc bus voltage.\nThe cell capacitors in an MMC with the proposed PS-SWM\ncan be much smaller since they can be designed to smooth the\nhigh switching frequency ripples only because of a square wave\nat an ac terminal. With k = 1, the size of cell capacitor with the\nproposed modulation is derived in (6) by applying a capacitor\ncharge-balance in a switching cycle as\nC =\n( Idc\n2 + Iac\n2\n)\n· 1\nσ · VC\n[ π (d − M +1 )\nω + |ϕ|\n2ωtr\n]\n≈ Idc\nσ · VC\n[ π |d|\nω + |ϕ|\n2ωtr\n]\n(6)\nwhere ω and ωtr are the angular cell switching frequency and\ntransformer frequency, respectively, Idc is the nominal dc cur-\nrent, σ is the peak–peak capacitor voltage ripple percentage.\nSince M /22481 is desired in the application, the capacitance can\nbe simpliﬁed as shown in (6).\nThe arm inductance of an iM2DC in Fig. 1, Ldc ,i sa l s o\nsmall considering the equivalent dc current ripple frequency is\n2·N times of the cell switching frequency with the proposed\nmodulation. Ldc can be calculated in (7), where γ is the peak–\npeak dc current ripple percentage. Since d is usually very small,\nthe inductance can be simpliﬁed as\nLdc = 2π · Vdc\nω · γ · Idc\n·| d|·\n(\n1 − N − 1\n(1 + d) N\n)\n≈ 2π · Vdc\nω · N · γ · Idc\n·| d| . (7)\nThe TDR and passive components of the iM2DC consisting\ntwo symmetrical MMC stages can be derived similarly and com-\npared with those using a Q2L [13] and PS sinusoidal modulation\nmethod in Table I. The TDR of PS-SWM and Q2L is 18% less\nthan that of PS sinusoidal modulation due to the higher efﬁcient\nIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS, VOL. 34, NO. 7, JULY 2019 6007\nTABLE I\nCOMPARISON OF AN I M2DC W ITH DIFFERENT MODULA TIONMETHODS\npower transfer capability of square wave. The per unit of total\ncapacitor energy, deﬁned as total capacitor energy × fundamen-\ntal frequency /rated power is adopted to evaluate the capacitor\nsize in Table I, where ftr and f are the transformer frequency\nand cell switching frequency, respectively. With PS sinusoidal\nmodulation, the cell capacitors have to withstand both the funda-\nmental and double frequency energy variations [16]. Although\nthe fundamental frequency voltage ripple can be eliminated by\nsome methods to achieve smaller capacitors, those methods will\nresult in higher TDR. On the other hand, the cell capacitor with\nQ2L [13] and the proposed PS-SWM can be much smaller since\nonly higher switching frequency ripple exists when k = 1. Con-\nsidering the voltage ripple, current ripple, and thermal stress, the\ncell capacitors using a Q2L and PS-SWM will have similar size.\nTable I also compares the coupled arm inductors ( Ldc )u s i n ga\nQ2L [13] and PS-SWM when k = 1, which are both designed to\nlimit the dc current switching ripple. Since 1–2 D of the Q2L ( D\nis duty cycle) and | d| of the proposed PS-SWM will have similar\nvalues under same converter ratings, Ldc with PS-SWM will be\napproximately N times smaller than that with Q2L. The Ldc of\nPS sinusoidal modulation will be similar to that of PS-SWM due\nto the voltage applied on Ldc is one cell voltage in the former\nmodulation and the inductor voltage is the difference between\ndc grid voltage and the total capacitor voltage of a leg in the\nlatter modulation method. In addition, the equivalent dc current\nripple frequency of both modulation methods is 2 ·N times of\nthe cell switching frequency because of a phase-shifted carrier\nwave nature.\nIII. E XPERIMENTAL VERIFICA TION\nA downscaled prototype has been built in the laboratory to\nverify the proposed modulation method. The hardware is shown\nin Fig. 4 with the circuit parameters presented in Table II. The\nhardware can be conﬁgured as a single MMC stage or a dc\ntransformer consisting of two MMC stages connected back-to-\nback through a 40-kHz ac transformer. The experiments were\nﬁrst conducted on a single MMC stage connected to an resistor-\ninductor load with four cells in each arm to demonstrate the\nproposed PS-SWM modulation. The fundamental frequency or\ntransformer frequency is selected as 10 kHz and the switching\nfrequency is designed at 40 kHz to ensure the quality of ac\nterminal voltage since this downscaled hardware has a limited\ncell number on each arm.\nWhen the hardware is conﬁgured as a single MMC stage,\nthe converter is operated at 2 kW power rating and 250 V dc\nFig. 4.

Fig. 5(a) demonstrates the key waveforms of a\nsingle MMC stage. The arm voltages va(b)p(n) and ac terminal\nvoltage vab exhibits the square wave with equivalent switching\nfrequency ripples at 160 kHz in the given experimental condi-\ntion. Fig. 5(b) shows the key waveforms at 1 kW/150 V operating\nconditions when this hardware is conﬁgured as an iM2DC con-\nsisting two MMC stages with a 1:1 transformer at 10 kHz. In this\noperation condition, each arm has two cells and the maximum\npower is 1 kW. A ﬁxed phase-shift angle is applied between the\nmodulation waveforms of two sides. It shows that the power can\nbe transferred to the other side and the secondary dc bus voltage\ncan be established. The cell capacitor voltages are stablized as\nwell.\nThe ac terminal voltage vab of Fig. 5(a) and (b) is consistent\nwith theoretical analysis of Fig. 2(b). When cell number N is 2,\nthree voltage steps of vab (NVC , (N–1)VC , (N–2)VC )a r e 2VC ,\nVC , and 0, respectively; when cell number is 4, three voltage\nsteps of vab are 4VC , 3VC , and 2VC , respectively .

The transformer current\niac of Fig. 5(b) should be a square wave but demonstrates some\ndistortions due to the open loop control leading to a not well\nbalanced capacitor volatge, which can be solved by a closed-\nloop control.\nIV . C ONCLUSION\nIn this letter, a PS-SWM technique has been proposed. This\nmodulation method can be applied for an MMC to reduce the\ncell capacitor size without a TDR penalty. In addition, an iso-\nlated dc–dc converter applied as a dc transformer for an MVDC\nsystem can also beneﬁt from the proposed modulation method\nto achieve superior current control capability with a low passive\ncomponent size while in the past an MV iM2DC cannot achieve\nboth low passive component size and superior current control\ncapability at the same time. The detailed operation principles\nare presented and the sizing of passive components are derived.\nThe comparison shows the proposed modulation method can\nachieve overall low TDR and low passive components.\nREFERENCES\n[1] S.
