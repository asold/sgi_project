Changes in BIA \nand CPET prove the metabolic impact of lifestyle modification treatment.\nPOLISH ARCHIVES OF INTERNAL MEDICINE 2019; 129 (4)\n226\nUniversity of Gdańsk, patients were consulted \nby a physician and dietitian, as well as underwent \nBIA and CPET. In the first phase of the study, \nwhich lasted 6 weeks, the patients had 3 dietary \nconsultations and medical rehabilitation 3 times \na week in a daily ward of the Department of Reha‑\nbilitation Medicine at the Medical University of \nGdańsk. Patients were instructed on how to con‑\ntinue the exercise and diet treatments at home. \nAfter 6 weeks, a follow  ‑up medical consultation \nwas performed, and the dietary treatment and ex‑\nercise were modified according to the initial treat‑\nment outcomes. In the second phase, which lasted \n6 weeks, patients visited a dietitian 3 times and \nperformed exercise at home according to the pro‑\ntocol. At the final visit, the last medical consulta‑\ntion, BIA and CPET were done. The subsequent \ntreatment was continued in an outpatient clinic \nof the Department of Clinical Nutrition.\nThe BIA was done using a MaltronBioScan \n920–2 (Maltron International, Rayleigh, Essex, \nUK). Patients were asked to remove jewellery \nand to urinate before the examination. They \nwere also asked to refrain from eating for 4 to \n5 hours before the test, exercising for 12 hours \nbefore the test, and consuming caffeine (tea, cof‑\nfee, or energy drinks) or alcohol 24 hours before \nthe test. The CPET was performed with a Lo ‑\ndeCorival (Lode B.V ., Groningen, the Nether ‑\nlands). Patients had to report about 3 hours after \na light meal, in comfortable, loose clothing and \nsports footwear that allows walking on a tread ‑\nmill or riding a bicycle. They were asked to avoid \na considerable physical effort up to 6 hours be ‑\nfore the examination; strong coffee, tea, or oth ‑\ner energizing beverages; and cigarette smoking. \nMoreover, they were instructed to take their reg‑\nular medications on the day of the test. The data \nwere analyzed using Metasoft 3.9 CortexBio ‑\nphisik (CortexBiophisik GmbH, Leipzig, Ger ‑\nmany). Fat burning was assessed by an indirect \ncalorimetry method and estimated on the ba ‑\nsis of measured O 2 consumption, CO 2 produc‑\ntion, and the amount of external work (energy) \ngenerated during the incremental stress test on \na cycloergometer. The algorithm used for calcu ‑\nlations was provided by Cortex GMBH Germa ‑\nny. A SunTech Tango (Sun Tech Medical, Mor ‑\nrisville, North Carolina,  United States) was used \nto monitor blood pressure and a  CardioDirect \n12 (Spacelabs Healthcare, Snoqualmie, Wash ‑\nington, United States) to analyze electrocar ‑\ndiogram results.\nTreatment The dietary treatment was based on \nindividual diets formulated during the first visit. \nThe daily intake of protein was 15% to 25%; fat, \n20% to 40%, including less than 10% of saturat‑\ned fatty acids; and carbohydrates, 35% to 65%. \nThe energy value was individualized. The hypoca‑\nloric balanced diet supplied 1200 to 1500 kcal/d \nfor women and 1500 to 1800 kcal/d for men. If \nthe treatment was ineffective, the low calorie diet \nwas used with the supply of 800 to 1200 kcal/d \nof the patient’s eligibility  for treatment is based \non the body mass index (BMI). However, a more \ndetailed insight into the pathophysiology of obe‑\nsity is becoming more popular nowadays. The Ed‑\nmonton Obesity Staging System is a new tool \nthat can stratify patients into groups depending \non the type of treatment they require (noninva‑\nsive methods, bariatric surgery, or palliative treat‑\nment).9 We hypothesized that the use of bioelec‑\ntrical impedance analysis (BIA) and a cardiopul‑\nmonary exercise test (CPET) may help improve \nthe therapy, adjust the treatment with diet or ex‑\nercise in patients treated with lifestyle modifica‑\ntion, and also increase the safety of treatment.\nThe aims of the study were to compare the re‑\nsults of BIA and CPET in obese and lean pa ‑\ntients, to analyze changes in BIA and CPET dur‑\ning the treatment of obesity with a lifestyle modi‑\nfication program, and to identify parameters that \ncould be used to develop personalized treatment. \nHowever, the overriding aim of the study was to \ninvestigate obesity treatment based on BIA, CPET, \nand lifestyle modification.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS  A total of 200 consecu‑\ntive adult obese patients were invited to the study, \nof whom 45 individuals decided to participate. All \npatients gave their informed consent to under ‑\ngo a lifestyle modification treatment for obesi ‑\nty. Contraindications to the treatment included \nheart, lung, liver, and kidney deficiency, neoplas‑\ntic disease, active autoimmune diseases, mental \nretardation, pregnancy, lactation, drug and alco‑\nhol abuse, and lack of compliance.\nThe size of the study group was assessed based \non a pilot study that showed that peak oxygen up‑\ntake (VO2peak) results were lower than predicted in \n60% of obese patients regardless of age and sex. \nAdditionally, a body mass reduction greater than \n5% was found in 60% of participants who com ‑\npleted the treatment. On the other hand, in pa ‑\ntients who did not finish the study, such a body \nmass reduction was not observed. 10 Based on \nthe method by Altman et al,11,12 with an assump‑\ntion that the power of test is 0.9 and a P value is \nlower than 0.05, the minimal number of patients \nwas assessed as 30. Due to the dropout rate of \n30% in the pilot study, a group of 45 patients was \nincluded in the study. The study was approved by \nthe Ethical Committee of the Medical University \nof Gdańsk (Gdańsk, Poland) (NKEB/41/2010) and \nperformed in the years 2011 to 2014.\nThe study protocol was based on an intense \nlifestyle modification by a dietary intervention, \nmedical rehabilitation with patient education, \nand behavioral therapy. The diet treatment was \nbased on the body composition results assessed \nby BIA, fat metabolism (FAT) assessed by CPET, \nand the patients’ preferences. The intensity of ex‑\nercise in rehabilitation was based on the CPET re‑\nsults, mainly VO2peak, FAT, and fat heart rate (FAT \nHR). The protocol duration was 12 weeks. During \nthe baseline visit in an outpatient ward of the De‑\npartment of Clinical Nutrition at the Medical \nORIGINAL ARTICLE BIA and CPET in obesity treatment prediction 227\nchanges in the results observed during the obesi‑\nty treatment between patients and healthy con‑\ntrols. Detailed characteristics of the study and \ncontrol groups are provided in TABLE 1 .\nThe severity of nutrition disorders was as ‑\nsessed according to the World Health Organiza‑\ntion guidelines2 as obesity grade I (16 patients \n[36%]), II (20 patients [44%]), III (9 patients \n[20%]).\nThe coexisting diseases are described in Sup ‑\nplementary material, Table S1. Participation in \nthe lifestyle modification program did not require \ntreatment modification. The intensity of exercise \nwas corrected in patients with coronary artery \ndisease, hypertension, or asthma.\nNo coexisting diseases were found in 4 pa ‑\ntients (10.5%), while 8 patients (21%) had 1 co ‑\nexisting disease; 4 patients (10.5%), 2 diseases; \n9 patients (25%), 3 diseases; 4 patients (10.5%), \n4 diseases; 2 patients (5%), 5 diseases; 4 patients \n(10.5%), 6 diseases; and 3 patients (8%), 7 diseas‑\nes. The prevalence of metabolic disturbances (in‑\ncluding hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, di‑\nabetes, and impaired glucose tolerance) was as ‑\nsessed. None of the diseases were found in 19 pa‑\ntients (42%); 1 disease was observed in 12 pa ‑\ntients (27%); 2, in 9 patients (20%); and 3, in \n5 patients (11%).\nComparison of bioelectrical impedance analysis and \ncardiopulmonary exercise test results  The follow ‑\ning CPET results were lower for obese patients in \ncomparison with controls: peak oxygen uptake \nVO2peak (P <0.0001), oxygen uptake at the anaer‑\nobic threshold (VO 2AT) (P <0.0002), respirato‑\nry exchange ratio (RER) ( P <0.014), oxygen up‑\ntake to work rate (VO 2/WR) slope (P <0.0004), \nFAT (P <0.001), FAT HR (P <0.0008), and anaer‑\nobic threshold heart rate (AT HR) ( P <0.0003). \nThe results are shown in FIGURE 1  and Supplemen‑\ntary material, Table S2.\nThe  results of BIA showed differences in \nthe body composition between lean and obese \npatients in fat mass (P = 0.01), fat ‑free mass (P = \n0.007), resting metabolic rate (RMR) (P = 0.007), \nwith a daily intake below 30% of fat and less than \n10% of saturated fatty acids. The nutritional hab‑\nits were discussed during the 6 dietary consulta‑\ntions. The cognitive behavioral therapy was de ‑\nlivered at this step, including a nutritional diary \nwritten by the patient. It helped patients to as ‑\nsess the influence of the diet on their emotions \nand improved their awareness of cognition and \nnutritional habits.\nMedical rehabilitation was performed in \n2 steps: 1) in the daily medical rehabilitation \nward, and 2) at patients’ homes. The first step \nincluded exercise on a cycloergometer and gen ‑\neral training. The intensity of the exercise was es‑\ntablished based on the CPET result and FAT val‑\nue. The second step done by the patient at home \nincluded a warm ‑up (15 minutes) and proper ex‑\nercises (4 cycles of 3–5 ‑minute walking, 3 cycles \nof 3–5 ‑minute running) interspersed by breath‑\ning exercises. The last part consisted of rest and \nbreathing exercises for up to 3 minutes. The whole \ntraining lasted 30 minutes. Patients were instruct‑\ned on how to control their heart rate (HR) and \nblood pressure.\nStatistical analysis  Data were analyzed using \nStatistica 12.0 (StatSoft, Palo Alto, California, \nUnited States) using the Mann–Whitney test, \nχ2 test, and receiver operating characteristic \ncurve. The prediction model was constructed us‑\ning the Mann–Whitney test. The results were pre‑\nsented as means (range). The siginficant test re‑\nsult was set at a P value of less than 0.05.\nRESULTS  Study participants were selected from \na group of 200 naive patients who were able to \nchoose between the standard diet treatment, \na lifestyle modification program, and obesity \ntreatment. Lifestyle modification treatment was \ninitiated in 45 patients at a mean age of 45 years \n(range, 24–65 years), including 31 women (70%) \nand 14 men (30%). The majority of patients (90%) \nhad previously tried other treatment options. \nThe control group consisted of 32 healthy lean \nemployees of the university. We aimed to compare \nTABLE 1 Clinical characteristics of the study group\nParameter Study group Women Men\nObese patients\nNo. (%) of patients 45 (100) 31 (70) 14 (30)\nAge, y 43 (24–65) 41.3 (24–65) 48.9 (35–63)\nInitial BMI, kg/m2 37 (30.1–50.9) 36 (30.1–49.7) 39.5 (30.3–50.9)\nInitial body mass, kg 107 (70–167) 99 (70–128) 126 (92–167)\nControls\nNo. (%) of patients 32 (100) 14 (44%) 18 (56%)\nAge 30 (20–55) 32 (20–51) 29 (21–55)\nBMI, kg/m2 22.3 (18.3–24.7) 22.5 (20–24.7) 20 (18.3–24.5)\nBody mass, kg 75 (48–90) 57 (48–66) 80 (58–90)\nThe results are presented as mean (range) unless otherwise indicated.\nAbbreviations: BMI, body mass index\nPOLISH ARCHIVES OF INTERNAL MEDICINE 2019; 129 (4)\n228\nare shown in Supplementary material, Tables \nS6 and S7.\nAt the end of the 12 ‑week treatment, we com‑\npared the results of BIA and CPET (Supplemen ‑\ntary material, Tables S8 and S9) observed before \nand after the treatment in the group of 33 pa ‑\ntients who completed the treatment. An increase \nin RMR ( P <0.02) and a decrease in fat tissue \n(P <0.006) were found. There was also an increase \nin VO2peak (P <0.002) and a decrease in resting \nHR (P <0.017).\nThe results of BIA and CPET done before \nthe treatment were assessed with regards to \nthe effect of therapy. Patients who achieved \na reduction in body mass of 5% or higher were \nyounger in comparison with patients who did \nnot achieve this result (mean [SD] age, 41.1 [7.9] \nyears vs 52.7 [9.5] years; P = 0.001). A similar dif‑\nference was found when analyzing the 10% re ‑\nduction of body mass. Patients who lost 10% of \ntheir weight were younger in comparison with \nthose who did not (mean [SD] age, 40.2 [8.7] \nvs 47.6 [9.6]; P = 0.03). No differences related \nto any coexisting diseases or metabolic distur ‑\nbances were observed.\nThe  results of BIA and CPET done before \nthe treatment were compared in patients who \nachieved a weight reduction of 5% or higher and \nof more than 10% ( TABLES 3  and 4). Patients who \ndid not benefit from the treatment presented \nmaximal FAT at a lower FAT HR ( P = 0.02) and \nthe anaerobic metabolism of fat was initiated \nat a lower HR (AT HR, P = 0.005) (FIGURE 2 ), which \nseems consistent considering that FAT HR is al‑\nways followed by AT HR.\nThe  next step of the  analysis focused on \nthe most promising parameters described above: \nFAT, TBW, and body volume measured by BIA, \nas well as resting HR, FAT HR, and AT HR mea ‑\nsured by CPET at the baseline visit. A receiver op‑\nerating characteristic curve analysis was done to \nassess the sensitivity and specificity in the pre ‑\ndiction of achieving the 5% or higher body mass \nreduction (Supplementary material, Table S10). \nThe analyses which showed the highest sensitivity \nand specificity were FAT HR (with a cutoff value \ntotal body water (TBW) (P = 0.01), and extracel‑\nlular water (P = 0.004) (Supplementary materi ‑\nal, Table S3). The results may be in part casused \nby a higher percentage of women among obese \npatients.\nThe results of BIA and CPET were compared \nbetween obese men and women (Supplementa ‑\nry material, Tables S4 and S5). The results sug ‑\ngest typical sex differences related to physiolog‑\nically higher muscle mass in men and fat tissue \nin women. The CPET showed higher HR and FAT \nHR in women, and VO2peak, VO2/WR slope, VO2AT, \nthe rate of elimination of carbon dioxide (VCO2), \nmaximal ventilation, and ventilation in anaero ‑\nbic threshold in men.\nResults of obesity treatment  A total of 45 pa ‑\ntients underwent treatment, of whom 33 (73%) \nfinished the protocol. There were 12 dropouts \n(27%), who stopped the treatment mainly due \nto lack of time for medical rehabilitation. A de ‑\ncrease in body mass of 5% or higher was achieved \nin 23 patients (70%) who completed the study. \nAmong them, 13 (43%) achieved a weight loss \ngreater than 10%.

Treatment with diet and med ‑\nical rehabilitation prevents a reduction in fat ‑\n‑free mass, especially cell mass and muscle mass \n(80% of the fat ‑free mass).6 Muscle mass decreas‑\nes with age21,22 ; however, the effect is more rapid \nin obese patients23  and can be prevented by med‑\nical rehabilitation.6\nThe surprising result of the study is a high ‑\ner RMR in obese people. It may be related to \nthe higher body mass and metabolically active \ntissues, which require energy supply at rest. \nThe result of RER did not differ in patients who \nachieved body mass reduction. Data from similar \nstudies on obesity treatment support this find ‑\ning.24 ,25  Interestingly, we observed the increase \nof RMR at the end of the study. The RMR is re ‑\nlated to the energy consumed with food and fat‑\n‑free mass.26 The increase of fat ‑free mass increas‑\nes RMR and consumed energy. The fat tissue is \nresponsible for the opposite mechanism caused \nby adiponectin, which decreases appetite as well \nas insulin and leptin resistance. 26  This may ex ‑\nplain the differences in body composition found \nin the study. The fat tissue decreased, while RMR \nincreased. It could be caused by the diminished \neffect of fat tissue and intense physical train ‑\ning. The TBW was higher in patients who did not \nachieve body mass reduction. A higher TBW was \nalso observed in obese patients, which could re ‑\nsult from heart insufficiency, caused by obesity in \nthe form of concentric hypertrophy. 27,28  The re‑\nsults of the Framingham study proved that a rise \nof BMI of 1 kg/m2 increases the risk of heart in ‑\nsufficiency, which decreases the effectiveness of \ntreatment.28 ,29  However, patients with more se‑\nvere class II and III obesity, who were more moti‑\nvated to participate in the study, had been treat‑\ned ineffectively in the past.\nCardiopulmonary exercise testing  The compari ‑\nson of obese patients and controls showed signif‑\nicant differences in maximal oxygen uptake mea‑\nsured as a whole and calculated per kilogram. Ad‑\nditionally, obese patients showed a lower anaero‑\nbic threshold, lower RER, maximal HR, and breath \nfrequency. Significant differences in FAT and HR \nwith maximal FAT were also observed. Addition‑\nally, their maximal breath frequency per minute \nFigure S2 ). Patients with a resting HR above \n81 bpm showed a greater probability of a body \nmass reduction of 5% or higher (odds ratio [OR], \n19.5; 95% CI, 1.5–245; P = 0.003), with a similar \nresult observed for a FAT HR above 103 bpm (OR, \n19.5; 95% CI, 1.5–245; P = 0.003). Additionally, \nthe probability of a body mass reduction of more \nthan 10% was higher for a FAT HR above 103 bpm \n(OR, 12; 95% CI, 1.02–139; P = 0.01).\nDISCUSSION  Noninvasive obesity treatment us‑\ning lifestyle modification including diet, medical \nrehabilitation, behavioral therapy as assessed by \nCPET and BIA can result in a body mass reduc ‑\ntion of 5% or higher in 70% of patients, and a re‑\nduction of 10% in 43% of patients. Moreover, \nthe treatment outcome can be predicted in 92% \nof cases using a prediction model based on age, \nthe results of CPET such as FAT HR and resting \nHR, as well as fat tissue measured by BIA.\nThe extent of the obesity pandemic requires \nthe development of effective methods that can \nbe used across large groups of patients. The body \nmass reduction and percentage of dropouts re ‑\nported in our study are similar to the results of \nother studies, including those by Goodpaster \net al,13 Christiansen et al, 14 Share et al, 15,16 and, \nfinally, a large multicenter Look AHEAD study \n(Action For Health in Diabetes).17\nBioimpedance  The results of BIA indicate a high‑\ner RMR, a higher fat tissue mass, a lower fat ‑free \nmass, and a higher percentage of water, espe ‑\ncially extracellular water, in obese patients be ‑\nfore treatment in comparison with lean controls. \nThe treatment resulted in an increase in RMR \nand a decrease in fat tissue. No change in fat ‑\n‑free mass or extracellular water was observed, \nconsidering that the analysis of body composi ‑\ntion is difficult in obese patients.18,19 This may be \nthe reason why Diabetes Prevention Program,20 \nTRAMOMTANA,21  and a study by Share et al 15 \npresented limited data on BIA results. The Look \nAHEAD trial presented the results of dual ‑energy \nX ‑ray absorptiometry evaluated in 1019 patients \nat baseline, 6 months, and at 1, 4, and 8 years. \nLifestyle modification resulted in a decrease in fat \ntissue and an increase of fat ‑free mass in the first \nTABLE 5 Prediction models assessing the result of the treatment with intensive lifestyle modification\nComponents of the prediction \nmodel\nAccuracy, % Results predicting the lack of \ntreatment efficacy in patients \nwho achieved the treatment \noutcome\nResults predicting \ntreatment efficacy in \npatients who did not \nachieve the treatment \noutcome\nAge, FAT HR, resting HR, FAT, kg 92 1 1\nAge, FAT HR, resting HR, FAT, kg, \nTBW, %, AT HR\n88 1 2\nAge, FAT, kg 88 0 4\nAge, FAT HR, resting HR 83 2 2\nFAT HR, resting HR, FAT, kg 83 3 1\nAbbreviations: see TABLES 3  and 4\nORIGINAL ARTICLE BIA and CPET in obesity treatment prediction 231\nintensity below 45% of VO2max, which is approxi‑\nmately 57% of HRmax, while in normal ‑weight pa‑\ntients, it equals 45% VO2max, which correlates to \n61% of HRmax.33  Additionally, we did not observe \na difference in these results related to body mass \nreduction. This issue needs further studies as \nthe literature data are conflicting, showing an in‑\ncrease, no change, and a decrease of FAT.24 It may \nbe related to the method of treatment. Diet alone \nmay decrease the metabolism while medical re ‑\nhabilitation may improve it, or at least reverse \nthis trend.25  The data of optimal HR for FAT is \nuseful for patients and may be monitored in dai‑\nly activity using simple pulsometers.24 The anal‑\nysis of the effectiveness of treatment according \nto the results of FAT enabled the identification of \npatients who may benefit from lifestyle modifica‑\ntion. These patients were 10 years younger; sec ‑\nondly, their initial results of FAT HR were similar \nto those in controls. Last but not least, a higher \nAT HR indicated better physical fitness.\nWe also performed a gene expression study,38 \nwhich compared the whole genome expression \nin obese patients and controls regarding CPET. \nThe differences observed indicated abnormal ‑\nities in fat oxidation and maximal oxygen up ‑\ntake. The genes with major differences in ex ‑\npression were CLEC12A, HLADRB1, HLADRB4, \nHLA‑A29.1, IFIT1, and LOC100133662. Interest‑\ningly, the IFIT1 gene expression was different in \nobese patients with asthma.39\nPrediction of treatment effectiveness  The results \nof our study prove that it is possible to predict \nthe results of obesity treatment. The crucial val‑\nues are patient age (optimal <45 years), and rest‑\ning HR (>81 bpm). The results of CPET enable \nfinding the HR with optimal FAT during exer ‑\ncise (optimal >103). The BIA measures fat tis ‑\nsue, which if above 36 kg, predicts a good treat ‑\nment outcome. The analysis based on the above \nfactors enables the proper prediction of the re ‑\nsult in 92% of patients.\nCurrent studies indicate several factors that \nshould be considered, such as physical activity, \ncompliance, and time of treatment. 14,15 A low ‑\ner initial BMI predicts the worst treatment out ‑\ncome,15 which was confirmed in our group. The re‑\nsults of the Look AHEAD study indicate that op‑\ntimal assessment of the treatment should be \ndone after 2 months with initial assessment af ‑\nter 6 weeks.17,40 ,41 Treatment modification may \nbe based on additional patient visits or phone \ncalls, which increases the success rate by 8%.42 -44  \nThe results of BIA indicate the muscle tissue as \nthe important factor responsible for the treat ‑\nment outcome.6 The age ‑dependent decrease of \nmuscle tissue may be increased by a restrictive \ndiet6,37; however, it can be prevented by addition‑\nal medical rehabilitation.6,37 An interesting factor \ndescribed recently is FAT HR. It differs in obese \nand normal weight teenagers33  and women.24 Pa‑\ntients with low FAT HR may benefit from exer ‑\ncise of a long duration rather than more intense \nwas lower, probably due to the impairment of \nthe chest movement caused by obesity. Obese pa‑\ntients were able to exchange 2.3 l of air per min‑\nute, while controls exchanged 3.3 l. Additional ‑\nly, the results of the VO2/WR slope were lower in \nobese patients, which may indicate an impaired \ncapability of the muscles to perform aerobic ef ‑\nfort.30 ,31 The lower VCO2 levels in obese patients \nmay be caused by the lower amount of fat me ‑\ntabolized during exercise and impaired anaero ‑\nbic metabolism during exercise.30 ,31 These results \nprove the significant negative effect of obesity on \nall systems analyzed in CPET.\nThe sex differences found in our study (VO2peak, \nVO2/WR slope, FAT HR, ventilation, ventilation \nin anaerobic threshold, normal maximal venti ‑\nlation) were typical and described before in all \nage groups.32 ,33\nWe also identified the parameter that did not \ndiffer in obese patients, namely, the VO 2/HR \nslope, which proves proper heart metabolism.31,34 \nNo differences in blood pressure, maximal HR, \nbreath frequency, or VE/VCO2 slope, which proves \neffective CO2 elimination, were seen. Further ‑\nmore, it indicates that lifestyle modification, in‑\ncluding medical rehabilitation, is safe in obese \npatients.\nA comparison of the results, which significantly \nchanged during the treatment, proves increased \noxygen consumption related to increased aero ‑\nbic muscle effort.31 The lower resting HR may be \ncaused by the adaptation of patients to physical \nexercise. The results of Share et al15 were similar: \nthe increase of VO2peak and the lower resting HR. \nData from the Look AHEAD study showed a grad‑\nual impairment of the maximal exercise achieved \nby the patient, measured in metabolic equivalent \nof task (1 MET = 3.5 ml/min/kg of O2 consump‑\ntion), which correlates with obesity.17,35 Addition‑\nally, obese patients present fear of exercise relat‑\ned to the lack of self ‑assessment of exercise which \nis safe. The common error is related to short and \nintense exercise leading to tiredness. Controlled \nmedical rehabilitation performed in our study \nprovided the necessary education and ability for \nobjective self ‑assessment.\nThe valuable part of CPET is the ability to as ‑\nsess the amount of metabolized fat in g/h, and HR \nat which the FAT is optimal. Both values were low‑\ner in obese patients. It may be related to the im‑\npaired function of the muscles and the ability \nto perform exercise.36  Lower AT HR values lead \nto anaerobic, less effective FAT. 25 ,31,33  The use \nof CPET in our patients enabled the modifica ‑\ntion of exercise to optimal FAT HR related to bet‑\nter FAT.30 ,31 The value of maximal VCO2 elimina‑\ntion was shown to be lower in obese patients, \nwhich is caused by impaired oxygen debt dur ‑\ning exercise.30 ,31 The difference in FAT in obese \npeople is related to the phase of exercise when \nit is maximal.33 ,37 In our study, FAT HR in obese \npatients was 106.96, while in lean patients, it \nwas 141.2. The literature data show that in obese \npeople, the optimal FAT is related to an exercise \nPOLISH ARCHIVES OF INTERNAL MEDICINE 2019; 129 (4)\n232\nmediators of the effects of body ‑mass index, overweight, and obesity on \ncoronary heart disease and stroke: a pooled analysis of 97 prospective co‑\nhorts with 1·8 million participants.

The combination of BIA and CPET in addition \nto simple clinical parameters may predict the out‑\ncome of obesity treatment.

The results of the treatment \ncould be compared with matched obese controls \nand bariatric patients. The phase of diet and exer‑\ncise treatment at home could be monitored using \nmore objective methods than a nutritional diary.\nConclusions  The differences found in obese pa‑\ntients in the comparison of the BIA results such \nas fat mass and fat ‑free mass, as well as CPET re‑\nsults such as VO2peak, VO2AT, RER, VO2/WR, FAT, \nFAT HR, and AT HR, may be related to patholog‑\nical FAT and impaired exercise tolerance.\nThe significant improvement of BIA and CPET \nresults (an increase of RMR, VO2peak, and decrease \nof fat tissue and resting HR) found in patients \nwho reduced their body mass proves that a com‑\nbination of diet, medical rehabilitation, and be ‑\nhavioral therapy have a positive metabolic im ‑\npact on the cardiopulmonary system and muscles.\nThe results led to the development of the pre‑\ndiction model that can predict the outcome of \nobesity treatment based on lifestyle modifica ‑\ntion in 92% of patients.\nSUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL\nSupplementary material is available at www.mp.pl/paim.\nARTICLE INFORMATION\nCONTRIBUTION STATEMENT  MGN and PN conceived the concept of \nthe study and contributed to the design of the research and data analysis. \nAll authors were involved in data collection.
