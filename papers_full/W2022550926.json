This approach was a mandatory step for the parame-\nter optimizations before taking into account the material removing. The optimization of inner canalization\ngeometries to a milling tool was performed to transfer the oil mist. The Reynolds Average Navier Stokes\n(RANS) and Lagrangian equations were used to simulate the oil mist ﬂow inside the canalizations by\nintegrating the standard k-ε turbulence model with the STAR CCM+ commercial software. The dynamic\nnumerical calculation was used to optimize the inner canalizations of a milling tool. Because of the partic-\nular external tool shape, the micro spray cooling is not guaranteed to reach the cutting edge. The external\ntool geometry, the inlet pressure, the shape and the orientation of the inner canalization geometries in the\ntool body and the rotation speed have signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the lubrication eﬃciency. The main goal of\nthis study was to improve this eﬃciency as function of these parameters. Thus, parameter sets giving good\nlubrication were determinate for a type of tool.\nKey words: Minimum quantity lubricant / CFD / multiphase ﬂow / milling tools / inner canalization\ngeometries\n1 Introduction\nMQL (Minimum Quantity Lubrication) has been used\nextensively in various mechanical industries (automotive,\naeronautic, etc.). The MQL process oﬀered very small oil\nconsumption and beneﬁc eﬀects on machining (surface\nstate, increased tool life time... )[ 1–3]. Moreover the MQL\ncoolant technique is used to machine hardened steel and\noﬀered very good cutting performances (cutting tempera-\nture and surface roughness), regardless wet and dry lubri-\ncation techniques. MQL parameters were then optimized\nas function of the cutting parameters: i.e. higher the pres-\nsure at the exit of nozzle, better the ﬂank wears [4].\nThe two-phase air + oil mixture which made up MQL\nwas created either outside or inside the spindle [5]. In the\nﬁrst case, the two-phase ﬂuid may be ejected by external\nnozzles directly and wisely oriented on the cutting edge.\nHowever, the position of the outside nozzles and their ori-\nentation require careful attention, as shown by Lopez de\nLacalle [3]. On the other hand, the two-phase mixture\na Corresponding author: arnaud.duchosal@enise.fr\nmay go through the inside of the spindle and the tool\nbody by an inner channel. The inner canalizations net-\nwork has to be study to ensure the lubricant eﬃciency.\nTurning tools did not require particular study. The oil\nmist was easily sprayed on the cutting edge. Eventual\naerodynamic eﬀects did not have to be considered [ 6,7].\nIn grooving machining, the position of the external noz-\nzle has been also studied. The grooving tool produces air\nlayer around the wheel periphery, which aﬀects grinding\nlubrication eﬃciency. Thus, nozzle position and distance\nand the lubricant and gas ﬂow rate have signiﬁcant eﬀects\non lubrication eﬃciency and also on cutting forces and\nsurface roughness. In this study the author highlighted\nthe inﬂuence of the gas ﬂow with high speed camera. By\nincreasing the gas ﬂow rate, the particle sizes were re-\nduced and increased the misting eﬃciency. High gas ﬂow\nrate made easier the oil mist spray into the chip-workpiece\ncontact area [8,9].\nRotating tools, as used for drilling [1,11], can be even\nmore susceptible to the aerodynamic phenomenon, since\nthe distance between the outlet of the pipe and the cutting\nArticle published by EDP Sciences\n436 A. Duchosal et al.: Mech anics & Industry 15, 435–442 (2014)\nedge was very small. Material removal took place in a\nconﬁned space (drill hole), facilitating optimal lubrica-\ntion. But in certain cases, machining ductile material as\n303, 304 or 316 L stainless steels with MQL coolant tech-\nnique is poor. The pressurized air of the micro pulveriza-\ntion does not reach the air ﬂow rate to blow out chips\nfrom holes. The studies of Lopez de Lacalle et al. show\nthe signiﬁcant eﬀect to have high pressure outside of the\ninternal canalizations, regardless the roughness and the\nnumber of holes produced [ 10]. There were few studies\non milling machining with minimal ﬂuid coolant by inter-\nnal channels. All studies to date have focused on external\nMQL [3,12]. Aoyama’s study dealt with the inﬂuence of\nspindle rotation and inlet pressure on particle sizes in nu-\nmerical simulation [ 1]. His results showed the inﬂuence\nof pressure and the eﬀect of rotation of the channel on\nparticle size with STAR CD numerical simulation soft-\nware. It was clear that small particle sizes (Ø < 1 μm)\nwere much less subject to the eﬀects of rotation, and there\nwere more small particles than particles in the range of\nØ10 μm (Ratio of 1:5).\nNumerical simulation was required to observe and ex-\nplore the oil mist behavior with canalization geometries\nand diﬀerent inlet (Inlet pressure) and outlet (Machining\nconﬁgurations) conditions.\nLi et al. gave an overview of the RANS ﬂow patterns\n(Reynolds-Average Navier-Stokes) which was largely used\nfor simulating the continuous ﬂow [ 13]. The developed\nmultiphase models have given very good results regarding\nparticle behaviors. The Euler-Lagrange model was largely\nused for the diphasic ﬂow study [ 14–16]. Moreover, the\nstandard k-ε turbulence model was easily integrated to\nE-L model. The oil mist was constituted of very small\nparticles of about 0 .1 μm < Ø < 100 μm. The inertia\nwas thus neglected in the continuous phase ﬂow, as the\nparticle interactions. Therefore, the dispersed phase has\nno inﬂuence on the continuous phase behavior [ 17]. The\nparticle tracks were studied with the Lagrangian model\nby analyzing their velocities [18].\nThe study consisted in optimizing the inner canaliza-\ntion geometries of a rotating tool used in a surfacing pro-\ncess, with a no removal material approach.\nSeveral inlet (three inlet pressures) and outlet (three\nrotation speeds) conditions were considered scanning a\nlarge range of machining conditions. These conditions cre-\nated aerodynamic eﬀects due to the particular geometry\nof the rotating tool.\nThe ﬁrst part was devoted to the motion equations\nused in the commercial STAR CCM+ software. The very\ngood experiment versus numerical outlet velocities en-\nabled to consider in the second part, the rotation of the\nmilling tool. The oil mist sprayed on the cutting edge was\nthus analyzed to ﬁnd the optimal canalization geometries.\n2 Governing equations\nThe simulations treated in this paper were a three-\ndimensional steady ﬂow which involved particles in an\nTable 1.Constants for the k-ε turbulence model.\nCμ Cε1 Cε2 σk σε\n0.09 1.44 1.92 1.0 1.3\nincompressible gaz. The ﬂow ﬁeld was isothermal. Fluid\nmotion was described by the continuity equation (Eq. (1))\ngiven by [19]:\n∂\n∂t (ρf αf )+ ∂\n∂xj\n(ρf αf ufi )=0 ( 1 )\nwhere ρf is the constant density of the gas, αf is the gas\nvolume fraction and uf is the average velocity of the gas.\nThe momentum equation (Eq. (2)) for the ﬂuid phase was\ngiven by:\n∂\n∂t (ρf αf )+ ∂\n∂xj\n(ρf αf ufi )= − ∂P\n∂xj\n+ ∂\n∂xj\n[\nαf μf\n(∂ufi\n∂xj\n+∂ufj\n∂xi\n)]\n− 2\n3\n[\nαf μf\n∂ufm\n∂xm\n]\n− F + ρf αf gi (2)\nwhere P is the pressure in the ﬂuid, μf is the viscosity of\nthe ﬂuid phase and F is the rate of momentum exchange\nper unit volume between the ﬂuid and particle phases.\nThe standard k-ε model was one of the most popular\nturbulence models used in computational ﬂuid dynamics\n(CFD). This model of turbulence appears to perform sat-\nisfactorily [16] and was composed of two transport equa-\ntions for the turbulent kinetics k (Eq. (3)) and its dissi-\npation rate ε (Eq. (4)) deﬁned as follows:\n∂\n∂t (ρk)+ ∂\n∂xj\n(ρujk)= ∂\n∂xj\n[(\nμ + μt\nσk\n) ∂k\n∂xj\n]\n− ρε + τij\n∂uij\n∂xj\n(3)\n∂\n∂t (ρε)+ ∂\n∂xj\n(ρujε)= ∂\n∂xj\n[(\nμ + μt\nσε\n) ∂ε\n∂xj\n]\n+ ε\nk\n(\nCε1τij\n∂uij\n∂xj\n− ρCε2ε\n)\n(4)\nwith\nk = 3\n2 (Iuj)2 and ε = C3/4\nμ\nL k3/2, (5)\nwhere I is the turbulence intensity set to 0.1 andL is the\nlength scale set to 0.001 m in (Eq. (5))\nThe standard coeﬃcients are given in Table1,f o rt h e\nk-ε model.\nParticle phase equations were given by Andrew and\nO’Rourke [20]. The evolution of the particle phase was\ngoverned by a Liouville equation (Eq. (6)) for the parti-\ncle distribution function f(xp, up, ρp, Vp, t), where xp is\nthe particle position, up is the particle velocity, ρp is the\nparticle mass and Vp is the particle volume:\n∂f\n∂t + ∂\n∂xp\n(fup)+ ∂\n∂up\n(fA)=0 ( 6 )\nA.

Equation ( 7)\nmodels acceleration due to hydrodynamic drag, dynamic\npressure gradient, net buoyant force and gradients in the\ninterparticles stress τ. Dp is the drag function.\nThe previous Eulerian/Lagrangian formulations ig-\nnored the interparticle stress term which was model ap-\nproach. It can be shown by deriving the average mo-\nmentum equation (2) that this formulation accounted for\nthe kinetic stress that arise from local particle velocity\nﬂuctuations about the mean velocity. Moreover, particle-\nparticle interactions were neglected, so the interparticle\nstress was set to zero.\n3 Tool rotation simulation\nA previous study highlighted the oil rate parameter\nsetting as functions of input sets [ 21]. This step consid-\nered the simulation of a tool rotation used for the surfac-\ning process, with these parameters. Figure 1 showed the\nstudy tool. It was consisted of seven carbide inserts with\na diameter of Ø80 mm with HSK attachment type.\nThe main goal of this prototype was to be used in a\nMQL production line. A main canalization was drilled in\nthe centre of the tool as well as small canalizations (ram-\niﬁcations) in the sides to ensure the oil mist spray on the\ncutting edge on each insert (red arrow in Fig. 1). The\nramiﬁcations were oriented at 45\n◦ relative to the verti-\ncal axis. For further calculations in simulation, diﬀerent\norientations were considered in this study.\n3.1 Initial conditions – Boundary conditions\nDue to their large range of use, three rotation speeds\nwere considered: 5000, 10000 and 20000 rpm. Three\nTable 2.Air and oil ﬂow rates as function of inlet pressure.\nPInlet (bar) 0.3 0.77 1\nAir ﬂow rate (l.min−1) 512 784 904\nOil ﬂow rate (ml.h−1)1 0\ninlet pressures from experiments were considered: 0.3 bar,\n0.77 bar and 1 bar. In previous studies, it has been shown\nthat the most viscous oil retains small particles. The\nPX 5130 oil is considered here with 0.074 Pa.s dynamic\nviscosity. Thus, a 10 ml.h\n−1 oil mist rate with Ø1 μm\nparticle size was used for all the simulations [ 22]. Out-\nlet conditions were taken as ambient air (1bar absolute\npressure) in milling conditions (with workpiece nearby).\nThe following Table 2 summarizes the air ﬂow rate with\nthe constant oil ﬂow rate regardless to the diﬀerent inlet\npressures.\nThe commercial STAR CCM+ software cannot simu-\nlate rotation with deforming mesh. The solution was to\nconsider the rotation with a MRF model (Moving Ref-\nerence Frame). A constant angular velocity “ω\np”i sc o n -\nsidered with a position vector from the origin “ r”o ft h e\nmoving reference frame to the center of a control volume\n(parcels of particles). This relative velocity formula is in-\ntegrated in the momentum equation (Eq. (2)) in terms of\nvelocity and inertial ﬂuid forces. The rotation of the tool\nthus considered a moving reference frame model in an\nambient air (outlet condition). Diﬀerent rotation speeds\nwere then attributed to the geometric model by changing\nthe value of the angular velocity.\nFigure 2 showed the geometric model to simulate the\ntool rotation. The moving frame was composed of the tool\ncanalizations and the tool (blue contours in Fig. 2).The\nambient air modeled by the OUTLET (black contours) in-\ncluded the MRF. The static part simulated also the work-\npiece nearby with the wall condition above the meshing\nmodel. The MRF modeled the oil mist spray in a steady\nstate condition. The oil mist rate and the rotation speeds\nwere then in a steady state condition. The particle tracks\nobtained with the Lagrangian model outside the canal-\nization deﬁned what happened onto the reality.\nThe rotation speed and the particular shape of the\ntool created aerodynamic phenomena. These eﬀects have\na signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the behavior of the sprayed oil\nparticles (particle tracks). The spray optimization con-\nsisted in the capability of the dispersed phase to reach\nthe cutting edge (zero-based on Fig. 3). Thus, the opti-\nmal spray consisted in the capability of the spray projec-\ntion center on the carbide inserts should be closest to the\nzero-based.\nFigures 3aa n d 3b showed the two extreme cases of\nthe distance from the spread center in the plan section of\nthe insert relative to the cutting edge. The horizontal axis\nwas indicated by “−x” and the vertical axis was indicated\nby “x” from the zero-based.\nThis optimization developed here depended on diﬀer-\nent parameters:\n– canalization diameters to avoid pressure lost;\n– inlet conditions (P\ninlet);\n438 A.

The choice of the\nbifurcation diameters was in relation to the diameter of\nthe main channel. The majority of these studies was con-\nducted within the medical community. The analysis of\nthe air ﬂow into the lungs for the diﬀusion of drugs was\nlargely modeled [ 23]. The “lungs canalization” resulted\nin a succession of branches (ramiﬁcations). Those studies\nhave shown that the ﬂuid velocity was kept for deﬁned\ndiameters of lung canalizations [24]. The pressure lost co-\neﬃcient which depended on the ﬂow speeds and on canal-\nization sections reduced the pressure lost [25]. It is there-\nfore important to have a constant ﬂow rate between the\nmain canalization inlet and of each ramiﬁcation outlet.\nA.

(8)):\nSP =\n∑ n\nr=1\nSr (8)\nWith:\nSP : the main section of the main canalization,\nSr: the section of each ramiﬁcation.\n3.3 Inlet pressure eﬀect as function of the rotation\nspeed\nTwo inlet pressures (0.3 and 1 bar) as function of two\nrotation speeds (5000 and 20000 rpm) were considered in\nthis section. The 0.77 inlet pressure and the 10 000 rpm\nrotation speed were not considered for illustration. This\nparameter set was equivalent to an average phenomenon\nwhich was not relevant to explore in this section. But\nsome values will be presente d to observe the tendency.\nFigures 4aa n d4b illustrated the ﬂow of the particles at\n5000 rpm rotation speed for 0.3 and 1 bar, respectively.\nFor a 0.3 bar inlet pressure (Fig.4a), the oil mist went\nout the canalization and sprayed on the carbide inserts\nhalfway of the cutting tool (as shown the black arrow\nin Fig. 4a). The strong inlet pressure of 1 bar ensured\na better oil mist spray on inserts, but did not reach the\ncutting tool.\nFigures 5aa n d5b illustrated the ﬂow of the particles\nwith the same conditions as above (0.3 and 1 bar, respec-\ntively) for 20000 rpm rotation speed. Because of the high\nrotation speed and the small inlet pressure (Fig. 5a) the\noil mist had not enough velocity to be sprayed on the cut-\nting edge. A high pressure in front of the inserts had a\nsigniﬁcant eﬀect on the oil particles. These latter particles\nwere stuck in the tool body and were never reached the\ncutting edge. For a strong inlet pressure of 1 bar, the oil\nparticles were sprayed onto the carbide inserts, halfway of\nthe cutting edge (as shown the black arrow on Fig. 5b).\nThe simulations showed for low rotation speeds, the\ninlet conditions did not have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the\nexternal oil mist behavior. For high rotation speeds, a\nhigher inlet pressure was required to ensure the spraying\non the carbide inserts. Whatever the conditions, the oil\nmist did not reach the cutting edge. It was therefore es-\nsential to see the inﬂuence of another parameter which\nwas the inner canalization geometries (orientation). The\nfollowing Table 3 shows the outlet average velocities for\ndiﬀerent inlet pressures and rotation speeds.\nRotation speed has an eﬀect on the average veloc-\nity. Due to the centrifugal forces, the droplet velocities\n440 A. Duchosal et al.: Mech anics & Industry 15, 435–442 (2014)\nTable 3.

Droplet inertia\nis not neglected despite the small particle size considered.\n3.4 Orientation eﬀect of the canalizations\nThis part was devoted to the inﬂuence of the inner\norientation of the canalization of the tool. Diﬀerent ori-\nentations of the ramiﬁcations (45 ◦,6 0◦ and 75◦ relative\nto the vertical axis) were taken into consideration in or-\nder to study their inﬂuence on the oil mist behavior. Nu-\nmerical simulations were carried out for diﬀerent rota-\ntion speeds (5000, 10000 and 20000 rpm) and diﬀerent\ninlet pressures (0.3 bar, 0.77 bar and 1 bar), from ex-\nperimental data [23]. The goal of the simulations was to\nﬁnd favourable conditions where the oil mist reached the\ncutting edge. The reference was the zero-based deﬁned\nin Figure 3. More spraying reached the zero-based, the\nbetter the conﬁguration.\nFigures 6a−6c illustrated the spread of the oil mist\nand its center positions relative to the zero-based for 45\n◦,\n60◦ and 75◦, respectively. Inlet pressures relative to the\nrotation speeds were considered for each illustration. Er-\nror bars showed the average spread of the oil mist on the\nseven inserts. The dots represent the center of the average\nspread of the particles on inserts.\nFor 45\n◦ orientated canalization (Fig. 6a), the spread\nwas regular and uniform at low rotation speed (5000 rpm),\nregardless the inlet pressure. Increasing the input pressure\ntended to reach the center of the oil mist spread to the\nzero-based, but still far away (about 4 mm). The spread\nwas less homogeneous for 10000 rpm. The rotation speed\nincrease took the spread center of the oil mist away from\nthe zero-based. For 20 000 rpm the oil particles were stuck\nbetween the tool body and inserts for 0.3 bar and 0.77 bar,\nbecause of the tool shape and the high rotation speed.\nWith a higher pressure (1 bar) the particles moved away\nfrom the tool body and were sprayed at approximately\n7 mm from the cutting edge (Fig. 6a).\nIncreasing the inclination of the canalizations at 60\n◦\n(Fig. 6b) put the oil mist particles impingement closer to\nthe cutting edge of about 1 mm at 5000 rpm. Greater\nspreading of the particles was observed to 10000 rpm\nat 0.77 bar inlet pressure. The spray of the particles at\n20000 rpm became homogeneous. The higher the inlet\npressure the more the spray put closer to the cutting edge.\nThe impingement of the spray was about 3 mm nearest\nto the cutting edge, relative to 45\n◦.\nFor 75◦ canalizations, the oil mist spray was consider-\nably close to the cutting edge.

Duchosal et al.: Mechanics & Industry 15, 435–442 (2014) 441\nTable 4. Summary of the distances (mm) of the spray relative to the cutting edge zero-based on various input pressures,\nrotation speeds and inclinations of the canalizations.\nRotation speeds 5000 10 000 20 000\n```````````Orientations\nPressure (bars) 0.3 0.77 1 0.3 0.77 1 0.3 0.77 1\n45◦ 4.7 4 3.9 6.7 5.4 4.5 9.3 9.3 7.1\n60◦ 3 2.6 2.7 4.2 3.2 3.1 6.3 5.2 4.9\n75◦ 0.8 1.2 1.6 0.4 0.95 1.1 4.4 0.6 0.05\nThis tendency was enhanced with the increase of the ro-\ntation speed.\n4C o n c l u s i o n\nThis study aimed to optimize numerically the inner\ncanalization geometries of a surfacing tool, by spraying\nmicro quantity lubrication on carbide inserts.\nFirst, the ﬂuid behavior (air + oil) was provided by\nthe transport and continuity Navier- Stokes equations.\nThe multiphase Lagrangian model was used to simulate\nthe particle track velocities in the ﬂow.\nSecondly, the inlet pressure, the rotation speed and\nthe inclination of the canalizations were considered to\nsimulate the rotation of a tool. This numerical study al-\nlowed the following conclusions:\n– The ﬂow rate conservation must be respected in or-\nder to reduce pressure losses. The ﬂow rate conserva-\ntion was provided by keeping the equality between the\nmain canalization section and the sum of the sections\nof the ramiﬁcations.\n– The inlet pressure must be high enough to spray the\noil particles onto the carbide inserts. Due to the rota-\ntion, an aerodynamic phenomenon was noticed. With\na workpiece nearby (machining condition) a high pres-\nsure was generated in fron t of the inserts. The ﬂuid\nwas deﬂected and therefore never reached the cutting\nedge.\n– A7 5\n◦ orientation canalization was recommended to\nbring the oil mist on the cutting edge regardless of\nthe rotation speed and the inlet pressure.\n– The use of low inlet pressures was not recommended\nfor high rotation speeds.\nReferences\n[1] T.
