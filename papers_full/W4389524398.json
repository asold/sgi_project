To handle\nAQs, several approaches have been proposed, such\nas providing individual answers to disambiguated\nquestions (DQs) for all plausible interpretations of\nthe given AQ (Min et al., 2020) or asking a clarifi-\ncation question (Guo et al., 2021). Among them,\nwe adopt that of Stelmakh et al. (2022), which pro-\nvides a comprehensive response without bothering\nthe user for clarification: The task is to identify\nall DQs of the given AQ and generate a long-form\nanswer addressing all the DQs (See Figure 1).\nThere are two main challenges to this task: (1)\nthe AQ may need to be clarified by considering mul-\n†Corresponding author\n𝑫𝑸𝟐𝑫𝑸𝟏 𝑫𝑸𝟑\nQuestion \nClarification\nQuestion \nClarification\n𝑫𝑸𝟐𝟐𝑫𝑸𝟐𝟏 𝑫𝑸𝟐𝟑 𝑫𝑸𝟐𝟒𝑫𝑸𝟏𝟐 𝑫𝑸𝟏𝟑𝑫𝑸𝟏𝟏\n𝑨𝒎𝒃𝒊𝒈𝒖𝒐𝒖𝒔 𝑸𝒖𝒆𝒔𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏 (𝑨𝑸)\n𝑷𝒂𝒔𝒔𝒂𝒈𝒆𝒔\nAnswer\nGeneration\n“The United States has the \nmost total medals . . . \nNorway has won most \nmedals  in winter Olympic.”\n𝑳𝒐𝒏𝒈 𝑭𝒐𝒓𝒎 𝑨𝒏𝒔𝒘𝒆𝒓\nPruned\n…\n“What country has the most medals \nin Olympic history?”\n“What country has \nthe most gold medals\nin Olympic history?”\nQuestion \nClarification\nInformation\nRetrieval\n“What country has the \nmost  medals in winter \nOlympic history?”\n“What  country has \nthe most total medals\nin Olympic history?” \n𝑻𝒓𝒆𝒆 𝒐𝒇 𝑪𝒍𝒂𝒓𝒊𝒇𝒊𝒄𝒂𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏𝒔\n𝑫𝑸𝟐𝟒\nFigure 1: Overview of TREE OF CLARIFICATIONS .

For example, the\nAQ “what country has the most medals in Olympic\nhistory” in Figure 1 can be clarified with respect\nto the type of medals—gold, silver, or bronze—or\nOlympics—summer or winter; and (2) substantial\nknowledge is required to identify DQs and respec-\ntive answers. For example, it requires knowledge\nto be aware of the existence of different types of\nmedals and the exact counts for each country.\nTo address the challenges and provide a long-\nform answer to AQ, we propose a novel framework,\nTREE OF CLARIFICATIONS (TOC): It recursively\nconstructs a tree of DQs for the AQ—via few-shot\n996\nprompting leveraging external knowledge—and\nuses it to generate a long-form answer. More specif-\nically, first, relevant passages for the AQ are re-\ntrieved. Then, leveraging the passages, DQs for the\nAQ are recursively generated via few-shot prompt-\ning and pruned as necessary. Lastly, a long-form\nanswer addressing all DQs is generated. The tree\nstructure promotes exploring DQs in targeting par-\nticular dimensions of clarification, addressing the\nfirst challenge, and the external sources offer ad-\nditional knowledge to cope with the second chal-\nlenge.\nExperiments demonstrate that our proposed use\nof LLMs with retrieval-augmentation and guid-\nance to pursue diverse paths of clarification results\nin the new state-of-the-art on ASQA (Stelmakh\net al., 2022)—a long-form QA benchmark for AQs.\nTOC outperforms existing baselines on ASQA in\na few-shot setup across all metrics. In addition,\nthis 5-shot performance surpasses that of the fully-\nsupervised baselines trained on the whole training\nset by 7.3 and 2.9 in terms of Disambig-F1 and\nDisambig-ROUGE, respectively.\nThe main contribution of this work is proposing\na novel framework, TREE OF CLARIFICATIONS\n(TOC), for generating long-form answers to AQs\nin ODQA, advancing the state-of-the-art on the\nASQA benchmark. TOC introduces two main in-\nnovations:\n• It guides LLMs to explore diverse paths of\nclarification of the given AQ in a tree structure\nwith the ability to prune unhelpful DQs.\n• To the best of our knowledge, it is the first\nto combine retrieval systems with LLM for\ngenerating long-form answers to AQs.\n2 Related Work\nA line of studies (Min et al., 2020, 2021; Gao et al.,\n2021; Shao and Huang, 2022) extends retrieve-and-\nread frameworks dominant in ODQA task (Chen\net al., 2017; Karpukhin et al., 2020; Lewis et al.,\n2020; Izacard and Grave, 2021) to clarify AQ and\ngenerate DQs with corresponding answers to them.\nHowever, their approaches require fine-tuning mod-\nels on the large-scale train set. On the other hand,\nour framework enables LLM to generate a compre-\nhensive response addressing all DQs via few-shot\nprompting.\nRecent studies introduce LLM-based methods to\ngenerate a long-form answer to the AQ. Amplayo\net al. (2023) suggest optimal prompts specifically\nengineered for the task. Kuhn et al. (2022) prompt\nLLMs to clarify ambiguous questions selectively.\nHowever, the studies do not utilize external infor-\nmation to ensure the factual correctness of the dis-\nambiguations, thereby potentially increasing the\nrisk of hallucinations from LLMs. Moreover, the\nresults could be bounded by inherent parametric\nknowledge of LLM. Concurrently, Lee et al. (2023)\nautomatically generate clarifying questions to re-\nsolve ambiguity.\nOur framework involves the recursive tree archi-\ntecture, inspired by several prior studies. Min et al.\n(2021) propose the tree-decoding algorithm to au-\ntoregressively rerank passages in ambiguous QA.\nGao et al. (2021) iteratively explore additional inter-\npretations and verify them in a round-trip manner.\nConcurrently, extending chain of thoughts (Wei\net al., 2022) prompting, Yao et al. (2023) apply\nthe tree architecture to reasoning tasks for deduc-\ntive or mathematical problems. On the contrary,\nTOC recursively clarifies questions and introduces\na self-verification method to prune unhelpful DQs.\n3 Tree of Clarifications\nWe introduce a novel framework,TREE OF CLARI -\nFICATIONS (TOC), as illustrated in Figure 1. We\nfirst devise retrieval-augmented clarification (RAC;\nSec. 3.1), a basic component that clarifies AQ and\ngenerates DQs based on relevant passages. TOC\nexplores various fine-grained interpretations, rep-\nresented as a tree structure (TS; Sec. 3.2) by re-\ncursively performing RAC and pruning unhelpful\nDQs. Lastly, it aggregates the tree and generates\na long-form answer addressing all valid interpreta-\ntions.\n3.1 Retrieval-Augmented Clarification (RAC)\nWe first retrieve relevant Wikipedia documents\nfor the AQ by using two retrieval systems, Col-\nBERT (Khattab and Zaharia, 2020) and Bing search\nengine1. ColBERT is a recent dense retriever that\nhas effective and efficient zero-shot search qual-\nity. Following Khattab et al. (2022), we use the\noff-the-shelf model pre-trained on MS-Marco (Ba-\njaj et al., 2016). We additionally include the Bing\nsearch engine to promote the diversity of retrieved\nWikipedia passages. Finally, we obtain over 200\npassages by combining passages retrieved by each\nsystem.\n1https://www.microsoft.com/bing\n997\nAfter collecting a passage set for the AQ, we\nrerank and choose top- k passages and augment\nthem to a prompt. We use SentenceBERT (Reimers\nand Gurevych, 2019) pre-trained on MS-Marco\nas the reranker backbone. For in-context learn-\ning setup, we dynamically choose k-shot examples\nwith the nearest neighbor search2 and add them to\nthe prompt. We initiate with the instruction of Am-\nplayo et al. (2023) and revise it for our setup. Given\nthe prompt with relevant passages and AQs, LLM\ngenerates all possible DQs and their corresponding\nanswers3.\n3.2 Tree Structure (TS)\nTo effectively explore the diverse dimensions of\nambiguity, we introduce a recursive tree structure\nof clarifications. Starting from the root node with\nAQ, it progressively inserts child nodes by recur-\nsively performing RAC, each of which contains a\ndisambiguated question-answer pair. In each ex-\npansion step, passages are reranked again regarding\nthe current query. It allows each step to focus on its\nown DQ, encouraging TOC to comprehend a wider\nrange of knowledge. Exploration of a tree ends\nwhen it satisfies termination conditions; it reaches\nthe maximum number of valid nodes or the max-\nimum depth. We choose the breadth-first search\n(BFS) by default, hence the resulting tree could\ncover the broader interpretations4.\nPruning with Self-Verification To remove un-\nhelpful nodes, we design a pruning method, in-\nspired by current studies for self-verification (Ka-\ndavath et al., 2022; Cole et al., 2023). Specifically,\nwe check the factual coherency between the an-\nswers in a target node and the AQ in the root node.\nBy doing so, we discard the generated DQs that\nask different or irrelevant facts from the original\none. For example, given an AQ “Who will host the\nnext world cup 2022?”, a generated disambiguation\n“DQ: Who hosted the world cup 2018? A: Russia”\nis a factually consistent question-answer pair but it\nchanges the original scope of the AQ5. We perform\nself-verification by prompting LLMs to determine\nwhether the current node would be pruned or not.\nPrompted with AQ, the answer to the target DQ,\nand the answer-containing passage, LLM identifies\n2See Appendix A.3 for detailed implementation\n3See Appendix C.2 for example prompts\n4It is suboptimal to adopt the depth-first search since it\nwould encounter unambiguous questions more frequently.

Note, TOC framework consists of\nretrieval-augmented clarification (RAC) and tree struc-\nture (TS).\nif the given answer could be a correct answer to\nAQ.\nAnswer Generation Once constructing the tree\nof clarifications, TOC aggregates all valid nodes\nand generates a comprehensive long-form answer\nto AQ. It selects the disambiguations in retained\nnodes of the resulting tree with the relevant pas-\nsages. If the number of nodes is insufficient, we\nundo the pruning steps from closer nodes to the\nroot node in BFS order. Passages that contain the\nanswers of valid nodes are prioritized. It finally\ngenerates a long-form answer, encoding AQ, se-\nlected disambiguations, and relevant passages6.\n4 Experiment\n4.1 Experimental Setup\nDatasets All baselines and our framework are\nevaluated on ASQA (Stelmakh et al., 2022). It is a\nlong-form QA dataset built upon the 6K ambiguous\nquestions identified from AmbigNQ (Min et al.,\n2020). More details are in Appendix A.1\nEvaluation Metrics We use three evaluation\nmetrics, following Stelmakh et al. (2022). (1)\nDisambig-F1 (D-F1) measures the factual correct-\nness of generated predictions. It extracts short an-\nswers to each DQ and computes their F1 accuracy.\n(2) ROUGE-L (R-L) measures the lexical overlap\nbetween long-form answers from references and\npredictions. (3) DR score is the geometric mean of\n6See Appendix C.4 for an example prompt\n998\nModel D-F1 R-L DR\nGPT-3 (Baseline) 24.2 36.0 29.5\nGPT-3 w/ RAC 31.1 39.6 35.1\n− Disambiguations 30.5 37.3 33.7\n− Bing Search Engine 28.5 37.4 32.7\n− Retrieval Systems 25.6 35.1 30.0\nTable 2: Ablation study on all components of retrieval-\naugmented clarification (RAC).\ntwo scores, which assesses the overall performance.\nFor validating intermediate nodes, we additionally\nuse Answer-F1 that measures the accuracy of gen-\nerated short answers in disambiguation. Further\ndetails are in Appendix A.2.\nBaselines Stelmakh et al. (2022) propose fine-\ntuned baselines. They fine-tune T5-large (Raf-\nfel et al., 2020) to generate long-form answers\non the whole train set. Models are evaluated in\nthe closed-book setup or combined with JPR (Min\net al., 2021), task-specific dense retriever for am-\nbiguous QA by enhancing DPR (Karpukhin et al.,\n2020). On the other hand, Amplayo et al. (2023)\npropose a prompt engineering method to adapt\nLLMs to the ASQA benchmark. They employ\nPaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022) and Instruct-\nGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022) that learn the soft\nprompts or adopt in-context learning with few-shot\nexamples. They conduct experiments in the closed-\nbook setup. Note that they share the same back-\nbone with our models, GPT-3 with 175B parame-\nters (text-davinci-002).\n4.2 Experimental Results\nTOC outperforms fully-supervised and few-shot\nprompting baselines. Table 1 shows the long-form\nQA performance of baselines and TOC on the de-\nvelopment set of ASQA. Among baselines, using\nthe whole training set (Fully-supervised) achieves\ngreater performances than Few-shot Prompting\nin all metrics. It implies that long-form QA\ntask is challenging in the few-shot setup. In the\nclosed-book setup, GPT-3 shows competitive per-\nformances with T5-large with JPR in D-F1 score,\nshowing LLM’s strong reasoning ability over its\ninherent knowledge.\nAmong our models, LLM with RAC outper-\nforms all other baselines in D-F1 and DR scores.\nIt indicates the importance of leveraging external\nknowledge in clarifying AQs. Employing the tree\nstructure (TS) helps the model to explore diverse\ninterpretations, improving D-F1 and DR scores by\nFiltration #(DQs) Answer-F1\nw/o Pruning (None) 12,838 40.9\nw Pruning\n+ Deduplication 10,598 40.1\n+ Self-Verification 4,239 59.3\nTable 3: Ablated results with and without pruning meth-\nods.

When pruning the tree with our pro-\nposed self-verification (TS w/ Pruning), the model\nachieves state-of-the-art performance in D-F1 and\nDR score, surpassing the previous few-shot base-\nline by 8.4 and 7.0. Notably, it outperforms the best\nmodel in a fully-supervised setup (T5-large with\nJPR) by 7.3 and 2.9. In the experiment, T5-Large\nin a closed-book setup achieves comparable per-\nformance with LLM baselines in ROUGE-L score\ndespite its poor D-F1 scores. It reconfirms the ob-\nservation from Krishna et al. (2021) that shows the\nlimitations of the ROUGE-L metric.\nIntegrating retrieval systems largely con-\ntributes to accurate and diverse disambigua-\ntions. Table 2 displays the ablation study for mea-\nsuring the contributions of each proposed compo-\nnent. When removing disambiguations from few-\nshot training examples, the ROUGE-L score is sig-\nnificantly degraded, which shows the importance\nof the intermediate step to provide the complete\nanswer. Integrating retrieval systems (i.e., Bing\nsearch engine and ColBERT) largely improves the\nmodel performance, especially in the D-F1 score.\nIt indicates using external knowledge is key to en-\nhancing the factual correctness of clarification. We\nreport intrinsic evaluation for each retrieval system\nin Appendix B.\nOur pruning method precisely identifies help-\nful disambiguations from the tree. Table 3 shows\nintrinsic evaluation for generated disambiguations,\nwhere all baselines are evaluated with Answer-F1\nscore that measures the F1 accuracy of the answer\nto the target DQ. Compared to the baseline, the\nvalid nodes that pass self-verification contain more\naccurate disambiguations, achieving much higher\nAnswer-F1 score ( +18.4). On the other hand,\nsolely using deduplication does not advance the\naccuracy, indicating the efficacy of our proposed\nself-verification method.\n999\n5 Discussion\nAmbiguity Detection TOC is designed to clar-\nify AQs without bothering users; hence does not\nexplicitly identify whether the given question is am-\nbiguous or not. It tries to perform clarification even\nif the question cannot be disambiguated anymore,\noften resulting in generating duplicate or irrele-\nvant DQs7. However, we could presume a question\nto be unambiguous if it can no longer be disam-\nbiguated8. In TOC, when it fails to disambiguate\nthe given question or all generated disambiguations\nare pruned, the question could be regarded as un-\nambiguous.\nComputational Complexity Although TOC re-\nquires multiple LLM calls, its maximum number\nis less than 20 times per question. Exploration of\nthe tree ends when it obtains the pre-defined num-\nber of valid nodes (10 in our experiments). Since\nthe clarification process generates from two to five\ndisambiguations for each question, it satisfies the\ntermination condition in a few steps without the\npruning method. Failing to expand three times in a\nrow also terminates the exploration. Pruning steps\nconsume a smaller amount of tokens since they\nencode a single passage without few-shot exem-\nplars. Compared to the existing ensemble methods\nsuch as self-consistency (Wei et al., 2022) which\ncannot be directly adopted to the generative task,\nToC achieves a state-of-the-art performance with a\ncomparable number of LLM calls.\nGeneralizability The key idea of ToC could be\npotentially generalized to other tasks and model\narchitectures. It has a model-agnostic structure that\ncould effectively explore diverse paths of recursive\nreasoning, which would be helpful for tasks that re-\nquire multi-step reasoning, such as multi-hop QA.\nFuture work might investigate the generalizability\nof TOC to diverse tasks, datasets, and LM architec-\ntures.\n6 Conclusion\nIn this work, we propose a novel framework, TREE\nOF CLARIFICATIONS . It recursively builds a tree of\ndisambiguations for the AQ via few-shot prompting\nwith external knowledge and utilizes it to generate a\n7See Appendix 7 for failure cases\n8The idea is aligned with the annotation process of Am-\nbigQA (Min et al., 2020), in which the target question is\nclassified as ambiguous if multiple distinct answers to it were\nobserved.\nlong-form answer. Our framework explores diverse\ndimensions of interpretations of ambiguity. Experi-\nmental results demonstrate TOC successfully guide\nLLMs to traverse diverse paths of clarification for\na given AQ within tree structure and generate com-\nprehensive answers. We hope this work could shed\nlight on building robust clarification models, which\ncan be generalized toward real-world scenarios.\nLimitations\nAlthough TOC is a model-agnostic framework that\ncould be combined with other components, our\nstudy is limited in demonstrating the generalizabil-\nity of different kinds or sizes of LLMs. In addition,\nthe experiments are only conducted on a bench-\nmark, ASQA (Stelmakh et al., 2022). Although\nTOC enables LLM to explore diverse reasoning\npaths by iteratively prompting LLM, the cost of\nmultiple prompting is not negligible.\nWe tried the recent prompting method, chain\nof thoughts (Wei et al., 2022), but failed to en-\nhance the performance in our pilot experiments. It\nmight indicate the disambiguation process requires\nexternal knowledge, which shows the importance\nof document-grounded or retrieval-augmented sys-\ntems. Future work could suggest other pruning\nmethods that identify unhelpful DQs more effec-\ntively. The performance could be further enhanced\nby using the state-of-the-art reranker in the an-\nswer sentence selection task, as proposed by recent\nworks (Garg et al., 2020; Lauriola and Moschitti,\n2021).\nAcknowledgements\nThe first author, Gangwoo Kim, has been sup-\nported by the Hyundai Motor Chung Mong-Koo\nFoundation.

Tree of thoughts: Deliberate\nproblem solving with large language models. arXiv\npreprint arXiv:2305.10601.\n1002\nA Experimental Setup Details\nA.1 Ambiguous QA Datasets\nAll baselines and our framework are evaluated\non ASQA benchmark (Stelmakh et al., 2022).\nIt is a long-form QA dataset built on the sub-\nset of ambiguous questions identified from Am-\nbigNQ dataset (Min et al., 2020). It contains open-\ndomain questions collected from Natural Ques-\ntions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). ASQA consists of\n6,316 ambiguous questions and their long-form an-\nswers with disambiguations, split into 4,353, 948,\nand 1,015 train, development, and test set, respec-\ntively.\nA.2 Evaluation Metrics\nFollowing Stelmakh et al. (2022), we use three eval-\nuation metrics on ASQA. First, ROUGE-L (R-L)\nmeasures the lexical overlap between long-form an-\nswers from references and system-generated predic-\ntions. Since the benchmark provides two ground-\ntruth answers, we report the maximum ROUGE-L\nscore. Disambig-F1 (D-F1) measures the factual\ncorrectness of generated predictions. A reading\ncomprehension model, RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019)\ntrained on SQuADv2 (Rajpurkar et al., 2018), finds\nshort answers to the ground-truth DQs from the\ngenerated long-form response. Then, F1 accuracy\nof the detected answer is calculated to check if the\nlong-form answer contains accurate information.\nDisambiguation-ROUGE (DR) score is computed\nas the geometric mean of ROUGE-L and Disambig-\nF1 to measure the overall performance. We addi-\ntionally use Answer-F1 to validate the disambigua-\ntions. It computes the maximum F1 accuracy of\nanswers to a single DQ. We use ground-truth dis-\nambiguations provided by AmbigNQ (Min et al.,\n2020).\nA.3 Implementation Details\nA large portion of our implementation is based on\nthe DSP library (Khattab et al., 2022). To dynami-\ncally find few-shot examples with the nearest neigh-\nbor search, we use pre-trained MiniLM (Wang\net al., 2020) to obtain hidden representations of\nquestions and compute similarity scores with Faiss\nlibrary (Johnson et al., 2019). We add 5-shot train-\ning examples to the prompt, following Amplayo\net al. (2023). It was the optimal number in our pilot\nexperiment.\nFor prompting LLM to perform RAC, we use\ntop-5 relevant passages. To determine whether to\nRetrieval System AC@10 AC@30 AC@100\nColBERTv2 56.4 68.4 73.4\nw/ Reranker 56.8 69.0 73.4\nBing Search Engine 43.3 58.3 73.5\nw/ Reranker 62.7 68.0 72.8\nCombined w/ Reranker 64.2 77.4 80.1\nTable 4: Intrinsic evaluation of retrieval systems. An-\nswer coverage at k (AC@k) measures the proportion\nof disambiguated answers that are covered by top-k re-\ntrieved passages.\nprune the target node or not, we rerank and pick the\nmost relevant passage among those containing the\nanswer in the target node. In the answer generation\nprocess, we took ten valid disambiguations in BFS\norder and five answer-containing passages. We use\nAPI served by OpenAI9 to employ GPT-3 as our\nbackbone. We set max tokens as 300 and top-p as\n1.0.\nB Additional Experiment\nB.1 Intrinsic Evaluation for Retrieval Systems\nWe randomly sample 100 examples from ASQA\ndataset and report intrinsic evaluation results for\nretrieval systems. Since a single AQ has multi-\nple ground-truth DQs and their answers, it is not\ntrivial to check how many answers are covered by\nretrieved passages. Inspired by Min et al. (2021),\nwe devise an evaluation proxy, answer coverage,\nfor measuring the quality of retrieved passages in\nambiguous QA tasks. We consider the retrieval\nas successful if the retrieved passages contain one\nof the answers to the target DQ. We calculate the\nproportion of success among DQs for a single AQ\nto check overall answer coverage.\nTable 4 compares retrieval systems in answer\ncoverage (AC@k) of top-k passages. Bing search\nengine without reranker performs worst among\nbaselines in AC@10 and @30. However, with\nreranker, its performances are greatly enhanced,\noutperforming ColBERT baselines. When combin-\ning two retrieval systems, it shows the best perfor-\nmances across all evaluation metrics; hence two\nresults are complementary. It achieves 80.1 in\nAC@100 scores, which indicates the passage set\nhas sufficient information if properly explored.\n9https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference\n1003\nC Qualitative Analysis\nC.1 Prompt Format\nWe add format descriptions to our prompt follow-\ning Khattab et al. (2022). Table 5 displays the for-\nmat specifically designed to generate disambigua-\ntions for a given question based on external doc-\numents. The format description is augmented to\nprompts of both RAC and the answer generation.\nBy using it, we encouarge LLM to comply with the\nformat.\nC.2 Question Clarification\nTable 6 shows an example of RAC for the AQ.\nRetrieval systems provide the external knowl-\nedge. Leveraging it, LLM generates disambiguated\nquestion-answer pairs. In RAC, long-form answers\nare also generated to follow the format but we do\nnot use them in the later steps.\nIn Table 7, we observe the cases where TOC en-\ncounters unambiguous questions and fails to clarify\nthem. It often asks different or irrelevant facts from\nthem of original AQ.\nC.3 Self Verification\nTable 8, 9 show examples of self-verification\nprompt. We prompt LLM to verify the current\nanswer is factually coherent with AQ based on the\nrelevant passage. It generates ‘True’ or ‘False’ to\ndetermine whether the node would be discarded or\nnot. We do not provide few-shot training examples\nor formats.\nC.4 Answer Generation\nTable 10 depicts an example of answer generation\nprompt. We use a similar prompt to that of RAC\nexcept disambiguations are given as inputs. It en-\ncodes up to ten disambiguations and five relevant\npassages.\n1004\nFollow the following format.\nContext:\n${sources that may contain relevant content}\nQuestion: ${ambiguous question to be disambiguated}\nDisambiguations: ${the disambiguated pairs of questions and answers, each is separated by a new\nline.}\nDQ i: ${(i)-th disambiguated question that clarifies the ambiguous question}\nDA i: ${short factoid answers separated by semi-colon (;) to (i)-th disambiguated question, often\nbetween 1 and 5 words}\nAnswer: ${a thorough, detailed answer that explains the multiple interpretations of the original\nquestion and includes the appropriate disambiguations, at least three sentences.}\nTable 5: Format description for both RAC and the answer generation.\nI will provide ambiguous questions that can have multiple answers based on their different possible\ninterpretations.
