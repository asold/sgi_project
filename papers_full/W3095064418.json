INTRODUCTION \nAs the Government of India has stated about the outbreak of \nCovid-19 in India, as of 25 March 2020, all education \ninstitutions must remain closed for 21 days, which later on \nextended to till date [1]. Soon after this announcement, \nseveral educational institutions apprized to plan-out their \nstrateg\nies for teaching students remotely. The Information \nand Communication Technolo gy (ICT) tools p lay an \nessential role in structuring teaching frameworks for students \nremotely. The paradigm shift from the face - to - face \ninteraction to the adoption o f virtual training was a \nchallenging task for educators and students also. Several ICT \n- based teaching tools explored by the various educators of \ndifferent institutions. The present IT infrastructure offers \nboth synchronous and asynchronous modes of teachin g to \nstudents. The term synchronous means real-time teaching, \nwhere an educator is actively involved in teaching students \nremotely using webinars and audio-video conferencing way. \nWhereas the term asynchronous refers to teaching anywhere, \nanytime, and anyplace. This method also offers flexibility in \nplanning time-table and set the pace of learning as per the \nlearning ability of an individual. It inclu des online learning\n© IEEE 2020. This article is free to access and \ndownload, along with rights for full text and data mining, \nre-use and analysis\nDOI: 10.1109/CICN.2020.60\nor e-learning through massive open online courses (MOOC), \nYou-tube channels, NPTEL, Swayam Courses, and recorded \nwebinar lecture series [2].  \n From the literature review, it observed that webinars are \nrarely utilized resource for teaching before Covid-19 [3]. But \neducators explored the real potential of webinars as teaching \ntools during this hard time. Webinars are live lectures \nbroadcast through the internet. Sometimes they are also \nreferred to as web-based con tent delivery mechanisms or \ntools. They are the multime dia resources for delivering \neducation and training. The critical characteristic of webinars \nis interactivity, the ability to view, send, receive, and discuss \ninformation [3][4][5]. Webinars may be available not only for \ne-learning classes, but also as part of a mixed course wherein\nfull participation is challenging. Webinars are not, however,\na suitable replacement for the classroom environment.\nTechnology can have drawbacks in some circumstances and\ntopics. It can be an exemplary addition to e-learning or mixed\nlearning [6]. Compared to other forms of education, webinars\nare unique in terms of providing opportunities for teachers\nand students to access and use many online interaction levels\n[2] and learning through technology already become an\nimportant part of the educational cycle at the higher education \nlevel. It enables students to discover educational content at\ntheir own pace and following their interests. This gives\nfreedom to students to take care of themselves rather than\nmerely being a teacher-led training [7]. The significant\ncomponent of teaching through webinar lies in the\nengagement of students throughout the live session and their\nassessment. Several researchers have argued on these\ncomponents. Sharon et al. argued over the authenticity of\nassessment taken through online mode.  It is a challenging\ntask for every educator to validate the assessment taken by\nthem for their respective cour ses through online media [8].\nSelf-disciplined and internally motivated students tend to\nengage themselves positively while learning through\nwebinars and online media more as compared to other\nstudents [7]. Despite all these factors, other issues need to\ncater during online teaching-learning by the educators:\ninstructional design, digital content prepared for live\nwebinars, length of webinar set for a particular topic by the\nteacher, and content delivery speed of teacher [9].\n This paper presents a case study on the faculty members \nof Chitkara University, Rajpura Punjab, India. The study \n328 \n \naims to learn their views and know-how of using webinars \nfor teaching Covid-19 to graduates in engineering. Faculty \nmembers of the university voluntarily participated in this \nstudy. They gave their feedback and concerns through the \ngoogle feedback form and telephonic interviews conducted. \nThe other sections of the pa per explain the background of \nwebinar technology, case study on webinar technology, \nconclusion, and future scope and references.  \nII. B\nACKGROUND OF WEBINAR TECHNOLOGY \nAlmost 95% of institutions of higher education use some \nform of e-learning. It have three basic criteria : 1) networked \nand capable of instantly apprising, storing / retrieving, \ndelivering and sharing direc tions and information; 2) \nProvided to end users via a device with regular Internet \ntechnology; and 3) focused on the most comprehensive view \nof learning solutions that go beyond conventional training \nparadigms [10]. The effective use of computers in classrooms \ndepends on teachers' computer attitudes. Recent research \nfound that teachers' attitudes, awareness and skills in \ncomputer usage were main factors that influenced their initial \ncomputer technology acceptance and subsequent computer \nusage behaviour. Also it was observed that teachers and \nstudents are often hesitant to consciously or sustainably \nparticipate in information technology practices. A well-\ndefined context is therefore important to predict and \nunderstand the use of teacher technology and acceptance \n[11]. There is clear and most obvious drive towards \ntechnological convergence. The new aim now seems to be the \ncreation of a university professor in the literacy of \ninformation and literacy. Therefore, the way technology \ntraining is carried out can be absolutely essential. Technology \nalone does nothing to improve educational practices; \nsuccessful integration involves the application and \nintegration of technological instruments into education. That \nmeans that the faculty should have not only access to \nsoftware integration tools, but also training in the use of tools. \nTech infrastructure's main task is to promote both learning \nand education technology for students. Technology to \nenhance and promote student - teacher interaction. The \nconnectivity (network capacity) and safety networks are key \nissues that need to be taken into account as most universities \nare provided with technical infrastructure to support Internet \nand database technologies (online registration, Students ' \nfinancial assistance, Online Di rectory, etc.). The technology \nrequired in pedagogy focuses on Web - based educational \nplatforms and incorporates interactive learning objects. The \ngoals of funding for technological learning involve building \nsociety. The creation of an online community that encourages \nknowledge self-acquisition and enables students to share \ncommon values, expertise and understanding may be an \nexample of this technology.[12]. The implementation of a \nwebinar platform for teaching - learning is also sponsored by \nthe information technology. The purpose and application of \nthis tool are very limited. However, the true potential of these \ntools was explored a few days after the Covid-19 pandemic. \nTable 1 shows the comparison of various webinars used by \neducators and industry staff. \n \nTable 1: Comparison of different webinar delivery platforms features \nFeatures/Platform’s ZOOM \n[13] \nGoToMeeting \n[14] \nGoToWebinar \n[15] \nGoogle \nMEET[16] \nCISCO \nWEBEX[17] \nMicrosoft \nTEAMS[18] \nFree version available Yes Yes(14-day trial) Yes Yes Yes Yes (limited \ntime \nMeeting participants \n(default) 100 150 100 100 200 250 \nScreen-sharing Yes  Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes \nWhiteboard Yes  Yes Yes No Yes Yes \nMeeting recording Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes \nE2E encryption No No (AES \nencryption) No No Yes(optional) No \nPlans from (p/m) $14.99 $12 $12 $6.00  $13.50 $5.00 \nMobile app Yes  Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes \nCustomer rating 09-oct 7.9/10 8.1/10 4.5/5  4.2/10 8.4/10 \n329 \n \nRoom Moderation Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes \nNo latency  Variable Good Good Good  Good Variable  \nMulti-languages Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes \nJoin webinars via \nphone (dial-in) Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes \nFile Transfer Yes  Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes \nCollaborative \nWorkspace Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes \nIII.  CASE STUDY ON WEBINAR TECHNOLOGY \nThe case study on the use of webinars as a teaching tool \nconducted on faculty members of the Chitkara University, \nRajpura Punjab, India. A total of thirty-eight faculty members \nfrom different engineering departments participated in this \nstudy. The participants get initial training to use the platforms \nfor their course work. Fig 1 shows that 82% of the \nparticipants have gone through initial training on the use of \nwebinar platforms for their online-classes, and 18% did not \nparticipate in the training proce ss. Further, they completed \ntheir courses by taking an average time for webinar delivery \nof 15hrs. After completion, of course, they provided with \ngoogle form to give their feedback response on the use of \nwebinar technology. The link for the same is as \nhttps://forms.gle/qnYFu25CdboTGM6VA . Their responses \nwere recorded in Ms-Excel and analyzed for further \ninterpretation.  \n \n \nFig 1: Faculty training on the use of webinar platforms \n \na.

The average age of  the participant is 34.3 \nyears, and the average teachi ng experience in years \nof the research participants is 9.74 years, which \ninfers that faculty members in this study have a fair \namount of teaching experience and a decent level of \nunderstanding things. Fig3 represents the \nknowledge of participants about using webinars for \nteaching before Covid-19. It is very much clear from \nthe data that the majority of participants, i.e., 63% \nof faculty members, have no experience of using \nwebinar technology for teaching purposes before \nthis.  \n \n82%\n18%\nDid you get the proper training to\nuse the webinar platform before\nits actual usage?\nYES\n NO\n68%\n32%\nGender distribution of participants\nFemale Male\n330 \n \n \n \nFig 3: Knowledge about the use of webinar technology \n \n \nb. Webinars as a System for teaching \nAfter the successful training session on how to use \nwebinar tools for online teaching, all the participants \ncompleted their course using these tools. Fig 4 \nshows the awareness gathered about the webinar \nplatform from a different source of information like \nfriends, print media, social media, and their \norganization information system. \n  \n \nFig 4: Knowledge about webinar technology \n \nIn the next step, participants share their experience \nwith the use of webinar tools for teaching through a \nsystem usability survey (SUS) questionnaire \ndesigned by John Brooke in 1996 [19]. It is a ten \nitems questionnaire that covers the usability factor \nof any developed system by the user. The participant \nhas to show their level of confidence for the usage \nof webinar systems in teaching defined on a Liker \nscale of 1 to 5, where 1 stands for “strongly \ndisagree” and 5 stands for “strongly agree.”  \n \nSteps to Calculate System Usability Score \n/g120 Calculate the data by taking average of \ncollected responses to each question asked \nas represented in table 2. \n/g120 Subtract one from average user response \nfor the question asked at serial numbers 1, \n3, 5, 7, and 9 of table 2. \n/g120 Subtract average user response from five \nfor the questions asked at serial number 2, \n4, 6, 8, and 10. \n/g120 Calculate the sum of all modified scores \nobtained for questions 1 to 10. \n/g120 Multiply the total by 2.5 and receive a \npercentage of the SU score. \n/g120 The usability score for the system would \nnow falls between 0 and 100. \n \nTable 2: system usability questionnaire \nS.No Item Average \nScore \n1 I think I would like to make \nfrequent use of this webinar \nsystem \n3.68 \n(2.68) \n2 I found the webinar system to \nbe unavoidably dynamic \n1.89 \n(3.11) \n3 I believed it to be an easy to \nuse webinar program. \n3.42 \n(2.42) \n4 In order to use the webinar \nprogram, I believe I need the \nassistance of a technical \nperson. \n2.34 \n(2.66) \n5 I found that different \nfunctions were well \nincorporated into this \nwebinar framework. \n3.66 \n(2.66) \n6 I found the webinar program \nwas somewhat inconsistent. \n2.00 \n(3.00) \n7 I'd imagine the majority of \npeople would learn to use this \nwebinar system very fast. \n3.42 \n(2.42) \n8 I found the webinar system to \nbe very complicated to use. \n1.84 \n(3.16) \n9 I was very confident in using \nthe webinar system. \n3.68 \n(2.68) \n10 Before I could start this \nwebinar system I would learn \nmany things. \n2.50 \n(2.50) \nTotal SUS Score 27.29\nSUS Score in %age (2729 * 2.5) 68.22% \n37%\n63%\nDo you have prior knowledge of\nusing webinars for teaching\nbefore covid-19?\nYES\n NO\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\nFriends Print Social\nmedia\nYour\norganization\nHow do you get to know about the \nwebinar technology?\n331 \n \nAccording to John Brooke method to calculate system \nusability, the overall score higher than 58% is acceptable for \nany system to be used on a large scale by the consumers. For \nthis case study, the overall score obtained is 68.22%, which \nmeans that the webinar system for teaching students remotely \nis acceptable by the faculty members of the university \nsignificantly[19][20].  \n \nc. Additional reviews \nFurther, participants asked to give their review on webinar \ntechnology as per the questions asked and represented below: \nFirstly, based on their exper ience of usage of webinar \ntechnology, their recommendation for future use and to other \ncolleagues is represented by fig 5. Accordingly, 86% of \nfaculty members are in favour of recommending webinar \ntechnology to other faculty members for their courses. \n \n \nFig 5: Faculty recommendation for the use of webinar technology. \n \nSecondly, another important aspect regarding the teaching-\nlearning process is the achievement of course learning \noutcomes. As teaching through webinars is a new experience \nfor the majority of the faculty members in the research study. \n68.4% of the faculty members have the views of achieving \nthe course learning outcomes of their respective courses by \nteaching online using webinar technology. Rest 26.3% have \nmarginally achieved, and 5.3% of faculty members have not \nachieved the learning outcomes of their course through the \nwebinar teaching method. The detailed description is as \nshown in fig 6 below. \n \n \nFig 6: Faculty perception about course learning outcome achieved \n \nThirdly, after using different types of the webinar platform, \ntheir preference about using the platform amongst widely \nused ones are as shown in fig 7.  According to the choice of \nplatform, 68.4% of the participant likes Go-To-Webinar \nplatform, 7.80% like Microsoft Teams, 13.15% likes Google \nMeet, and 10.52% like Zoom platform to conduct live \nwebinars. It is evident from the data that Go-To-Webinar is \nthe most preferred software platform by the majority of the \nfaculty members to take their courses using webinar \ntechnology. \n \nFig 7: Preference of webinar software for future use \n \nFinally, the participants shared the challenges faced by them \nwhile conducting live webinars using the platforms \nmentioned above. Some of these challenges are mentioned \nbelow as: \n \n“Audio connection problem faced by me, when the receiver \nexactly does not about \"how to connect audio.\" \n \n“Writing with the pen tool.” \n \n“Unable to chat and teach at the same time. Also, the audio \nwas not working well sometimes.” \n  \n“If you are mute n you forget to  unmute yourself; there is no \none to tell you this unless you have a co-organizer.” \n0 1\n4\n18\n15\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n12345\nHow likely would you like to recommend\nthe use of a webinar tool for teaching to\nyour colleagues\n11\n10\n18\n8\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n12345\nDid you feel that learning objectives of\nyour course achieved through using\nwebinar as a teaching tool?\nWhich software tool you prefer most to\ndeliver webinars for your course?\nGotoWebinar Microsoft Teams\nGoogle Meet Zoom\n332 \n \n \nWhile the other challenges are internet connectivity, the large \nsize of video recording, screen  sharing, making an attendee \nas presenter, student-teacher interaction and resource \nmaterial sharing, etc.   \nIV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE SCOPE \nThe webinar is an online digital content delivery platform that \nwas not in use before the Covid-19 pandemic outbreak. A \nsudden shift in the teaching-learning process had explored the \ntrue potential of the information technology infrastructure of \nevery country throughout the world. In order to curb the \nnegative effect or loss of educational time, webinars or online \nlearning platforms emerged as true saviours. Shifting from \noffline to online mode of teaching requires well-planned \nexecution of the administrative authorities. Hence, \nexploration of different platfo rms, training to the faculty \nmembers and students, conducting demo sessions, and \nintroducing online assessment platforms becomes useful in \nthis need of the hour. To examine the acceptance and \nfeedback of the faculty members who had experienced this \nchange in a higher educational institute, a case study so \nconducted. From the study, it observed that the acceptance \nrate of this technology by the faculty member of a particular \nuniversity is 68.22%. Their organization provides full \nsupport in providing them training and other relevant \nresources, which result in ac hieving the course learning \noutcomes for many of the courses successfully. In the end, as \nthis webinar technology is an outcome of information \ntechnology, whose backbone is internet connectivity. Many \ntimes faculty members faced difficulty in conducting their \nsession due to this only reason. Other challenges include \nwriting with a pen, audien ce interaction, audience \nengagement, and assessments. Futu re work in this regard is \nto prepare faculty members to make their session more \nengaging and improve the rate of achieving the learning \noutcome of the course. Also, efforts in making the assessment \nmore and more authentic so that students prepare well and \nlearn more sincerely. \nREFERENCES \n[1] “Press information Bureau,” 2020. \nhttps://www.mha.gov.in/sites/default/files/PR_NationalLock\ndown_26032020_0.pdf. \n[2] I.
