  "abstract": "Acronyms, abbreviations, and symbols play a significant role in clinical notes. Acronym and symbol sense disambiguation are crucial natural language processing (NLP) tasks that ensure the clarity and consistency of clinical notes and downstream NLP processing. Previous studies using traditional machine learning methods have been relatively successful in tackling this issue. In our research, we conducted an evaluation of large language models (LLMs), including ChatGPT 3.5 and 4, as well as other open LLMs, and BERT-based models, across three NLP tasks: acronym and symbol sense disambiguation, semantic similarity, and relatedness. Our findings emphasize ChatGPT's remarkable ability to distinguish between senses with minimal or zero-shot training. Additionally, open source LLM Mixtrial-8x7B exhibited high accuracy for acronyms with fewer senses, and moderate accuracy for symbol sense accuracy. BERT-based models outperformed previous machine learning approaches, achieving an impressive accuracy rate of over 95%, showcasing their effectiveness in addressing the challenge of acronym and symbol sense disambiguation. Furthermore, ChatGPT exhibited a strong correlation, surpassing 70%, with human gold standards when evaluating similarity and relatedness.",
