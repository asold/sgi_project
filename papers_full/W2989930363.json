INTRODUCTION  \nThe quality of load matching of Photovoltaic (PV) and AC load types has considered one of  \nthe urging problems. The key solution of such a problem has been characterized by the inverter configuration \nand its capability of supplying pure sine wave and contr olled voltage limit for AC loads. The line frequency \ntransformers (LFT) employed in the grid side of transformer -type PV inverters are large and heavyweight, \ntherefore, such inverter systems are bulky and tough to install, while high -frequency transformers  (HFT) \nutilized on the dc -dc stage are much smaller than the line frequency transformer. Nevertheless, they have \nmany power stages that  raise the system complexity and decrease both the overall effic iency and system \nreliability [1-5]. Now, the focus has be come to get the extreme energy from the PV system and step up PV \noutput voltage from 24 V to 100 V then to 312 V, because of the high cost of the photovoltaic modules. \nHence, the 312 VDC is inverted to AC 220 V (RMS value) successfully by means of single -phase inverter. \nThe requirement of the power rating inverter is increased to run the electrical and digital home equipment \nefficiently. The majority of the available commercially uninterruptible power. Supplies (UPSs) are quasi-sine \nwave inverters or square  wave inverters. If an electronic device operated by these inverters, it will be \ndamaged because of t he contents of the harmonics [ 6, 7]. The generation of a pure wave is significance in \nInt J Elec & Comp Eng  ISSN: 2088-8708  \n \nDevelopment and implementation of two-stage boost converter for single-phase inve … (Basem E. Elnaghi) \n661 \nelectronics energy but, the majority of the existing sinusoidal wave inverters are costly and the production is \nstraight. The switching technique of SPWM is described as a powerful technique so it was used in a pure sine \nwave inverter. The PV output DC voltage is raised by a DC -DC con verter to a suitable level then  \nit is co nverted to an AC voltage by the applying SPWM strategy to the inverter  using a PIC  \nmicrocontroller [8, 9]. The SPWM is used in the applications of electronics energy such as UPS, renewable \nenergy system, and motor driver [ 10]. SPWM techniques are described  by fixed amplitude pulses with \nvarious duty cycles for each period. The generation of this signal is carried  out traditionally by comparing  \na triangular wave (carrier signal) with a sinusoidal wave (reference signal) that has th e required  \nfrequency [11-13]. Because of the module of the PWM structure, Microcontroller is able to keep orders to \nproduce the required waveform of the implication of pulse width.  The obj ective of this process is using  \na peripheral interface controller (PIC) microcontroller instead  of t he conventional method. Through  \nthe system of PIC16f877A, variable frequency pulse width implication signal is supplied by Microcontroller \nwhich dominates the gate drive voltage. Microcontroller accomplished control circuit if it is used for grid \nconnection or stand-alone, but this inverter implementation is from a direct supply of photovoltaic cells has \ncompleted control circuit in dead time. A Microcontroller is enough easy and adaptable to change the control \nalgorithms with low cost in a real -time a nd without additional chang es in hardware and it decreases  \nthe complication of the control circuit of the single-phase inverter bridge [14]. The paper aims to \na. Introduce hardware design for a two -stage boost converter in which each stage is controlled separ ately \nby PWM signal for controlling voltage to boost the PV low voltage (15 -45 V DC) to a high DC link \nvoltage (312 VDC) required for single-phase inverter to produce 220 VAC for integrating with the utility \ngrid without using niegher LFT nor HFT to avoid their drawbacks mentioned above. \nb. Develop a simple control circuit for single -phase inverter interfaced by simple flexible controller PIC \nmicrocontroller to produce a pure sinusoidal AC voltage according to the grid voltage and frequency \n(220 VAC, 50 Hz). \n \n \n2. THE PROBLEM \nAn output voltage of photovoltaic arrays is very low while ac applications need high voltage level, \nso a single stage boost converter cannot accomplish such a high transformation ratio that implies large input \ncurrent that would increase the co nduction losses in the switching MOSFET. Therefore, the converter \nefficiency is reduced. Additionally, there is a dangerous reverse re covery problem in the diode [1 5, 16].  \nThe duty ratio (D) of the converter . Has an inverse relation with the adequacy (Ƞ) of the converter  \ncircuit [17] as given in (1): \n \n \n2\n1\n1\n1\nL\nload\nR\nDR\n \n\n\n \n(1) \n \nRL is the self -resistance of the inductor. Therefore, in the consideration for the equation, the duty \nratio cannot be increased above a certain maximum limit (D >  0.9) as the feedback loop is difficult to \nstabilize, moreover, the changes in the transistor state require a finite amount of time. Thus, the two -stage \nboost converter in cascaded was suggested with a high step -up voltage ratio and maximum efficiency.  \nThe main power switch of each stage is supplied with a PWM signal at the same time with little different \nduty ratio depending on the level of the voltage step-up at each stage. The inverter is used to convert its input \nDC voltage (converter output) to an AC output voltage. Although the ideal inverter has output voltage \nwaveform that is sinusoidal, the practical inverter has a waveform which is non -sinusoidal and includes \nharmonics, therefore, the electronic devices driven by this inverter will be damaged as a  result of these \nharmonic contents [18, 19]. The inverter output harmonics content depends on the number of pulses per cycle \nin inverter output [1 9-23]. Some pulses are affected by the circuit and some of the pulses are affected by \ncircuit power losses problem during. \nSwitching, as well. The high technique of switching will give a share of the high energy losses. \nThese factors should be considered to meet the following requirements: equipment cost, filter size, and power \nloss in the switching element. The m ain problem is the dead time control. It is necessary that the dead time \nperiod is appropriate to prevent switch damage and harmonic problem. When the dead time is short enough, \nit will be the reason for damaging to the switches and when it is long, it wil l be the reason for an increase in \nthe whole harmonic distortion percentage [10, 11]. The key goals of the paper: \na. It presents a solution of a high quality of load matching between PV and AC loads through enhancing \nperformance of the hardware design elements and supporting them by software package. \n      ISSN: 2088-8708 \nInt J Elec & Comp Eng, Vol. 10, No. 1, February 2020 : 660 - 669 \n662 \nb. The paper has implemented a  hardware design for a two -stage boost converter, each stage is controlled \nseparately by PWM signal for controlling the voltage.  \nc. The paper has also developed another hardware des ign for a model of inverter interfaced by simple \nflexible controller PIC microcontroller capable of generating PWM to improve the output voltage \nwaveform. \nd. Software package simulation has been developed in Proteus and PSIM to support and validate  \nthe proposed hard ware design tools. \n \n \n3. PROPOSED TWO-STAGE BOOST CONVERTER CONFIGURATION \nFigure 1 illustrates the main circuit of the proposed converter. It is supposed that the switches are \nideal.

When we concentrate on the input \nvoltage range and output voltage for a special application the duty ratio of both stages can be derived. \n \n \n4. THE PROPOSED TWO-STAGE BOOST CONVERTER DIMENSIONING \nThe converter input voltage from PV panel is 24 volts and the desired output voltage ranges from \n312 to 320 volts, so the duty cycle D varies between 0.923 to 0.925 and one- stage only will not be capable to \nboost the input voltage to the desired output level as discussed above. \n \n4.1.

For the control circuit of the two -stage boost \nconverter, a simple PI controller has been employed. Each stage was planned by its isolated PI controller. \nEach stage output voltage is measured and compared with the reference voltage and the error is entered to  \nthe PI controller to amplify the error signal which compared with a triangular signal to generate the pulse \nwidth modulated signal.

THE PROPOSED OVERALL SYSTEM DESCRIPTION AND PRACTICAL REALIZATION \nThe block diagram of the suggested overa ll system is illustrated in Figure  6. The utilization of full \nH-bridge inverter circuit is to convert the output DC voltage of the proposed converter to a sinusoidal AC \nvoltage at a required level output voltage and frequency. Producing a sin wave aligned around zero voltage \nneeds both positive and negative voltage across the load. This can be done from a single source by the use of \nthe H bridge inverter circuit as shown in Figure 7. Switches Q1, Q3, Q2, and Q4 are arranged in sequence in \nthis configuration in standard H -bridge circuit. Bot h gating signals GQ1 and GQ4 are switched together at \npositive half cycle while gating signals GQ2 and GQ3 are switched toget her at the other half cycle [2 4-28]. \nThe switching signals GQ1 and GQ4 lead the switching signals GQ2 and GQ3 by 180 degrees (half cycle) of \nthe switching control signal. The circuit output has a frequent waveform and it is not sinusoidal [25].  \n \n \n \n \nFigure 6. Block diagram of the proposed overall system \n \n \nFigure 7. H-bridge single-phase Inverter \n \n \nThe aim of utilization PIC microcontroller is generating the des ired signals of SPWM to control  \nthe H-bridge MOSFETs. A PIC microcontroller is the core of this system which is evolved to produce an \nSPWM with the control of dead time. The control of dead time is hel pful for decreasin g the cost of  \nthe capacitor filter. The dead time control is a highly important problem. There were probability interfering \nsignals between ON period switches pair (Q1, Q4) and OFF period switches pair (Q2, Q3) in the inverter of \nfull-bridge and the reason  for the short -term circuit of DC bus [ 10]. It is necessary for the duration of dead \ntime to be convenient for preventing switch damage and the harmonic content problem also. Dead time is \ndominated by using the PIC microcontroller. \n \n \n \n+\n-\nDc-DC \nBoost \nConverter\n1-phase \ninverter\nFiltering\n AC \nOUTPUT\nMicrocontroller (PIC)\nPV Array\n \nQ1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\nLoadVa Vb\nVdc\nInt J Elec & Comp Eng  ISSN: 2088-8708  \n \nDevelopment and implementation of two-stage boost converter for single-phase inve … (Basem E.

Moreover, development and improvement of the control circuit for a single -phase inverter using PIC \nmicrocontroller to implement it. The technique of SPWM is used to control the switches of the inver ter.  \nThe method of SPWM is outstanding to other methods because of making the quality of waveform results \nbetter where the THD is 0.84%.
