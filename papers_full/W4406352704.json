Prompts were used to identify \nmethods for optimizing navigational structure for usability, highlight library-specific information students need additional \nhelp with, and write summaries of page content. Post-revision, LibGuide access increased, and students provided \nanecdotal feedback that they perceive the changes positively. LLMs may enhance LibGuide discoverability and usability \nwithout adding significant time and resource burdens for librarians. \nKeywords: Generative AI; Artificial Intelligence (AI); LibGuides; Large Language Models \n \nBACKGROUND \nLarge language models (LLMs) like Chat-GPT [1] and \nClaude.ai [2] are useful tools for summarizing, predicting, \nand generating text. These tools have potential to increase \nproductivity and decrease the time burden of common, \ntext-based tasks for librarians like LibGuide content \ncreation. \nVIRTUAL PROJECT DESCRIPTION \nIn June 2024, a librarian used an LLM, Claude.ai, to \nfacilitate a major redesign of a dentistry LibGuide. \nThrough a series of prompts, the librarian consulted the \nLLM to generate introductions summarizing content of \nspecific pages and to restructure the LibGuide, formerly \norganized by resource format. Screenshots of the LibGuide \npre- and post-revision, as well as examples of prompts \nprovided to, and responses received from, Claude.ai are \naccessible via the author’s institutional repository.  \nThere was a 131% increase in LibGuide access from June - \nSeptember 2024 (n = 2,288) compared to the same period \nthe year before (n = 989). To the author’s knowledge, no \nother changes were made that would significantly impact \nusage like new outreach or instruction. In addition to the \nincrease in usage statistics, students have provided \nanecdotal feedback that they perceive the LibGuide to be \nmore user-friendly and useful after the revision.  \nDISCUSSION \nLLMs are cost-effective, as most are free, low-cost, or \ninstitutionally provided, and time-saving. Large amounts \nof text can be generated in a matter of seconds, whereas \ncomparable output by a librarian may take hours. \nAdditionally, LLMs can be used across various aspects of \nmedical librarianship across any discipline and can be \nused to generate or clarify text about complex research \ntopics like systematic reviews and data management.  \nWhile there are advantages to using LLMs like increasing \nefficiency and productivity, there are challenges as well. \nConcerns have been raised about accuracy of responses, \nprivacy, and algorithm bias [3]. While LLMs are skilled at \ntext-based tasks, they may not be able to adequately \nproduce responses that require nuance, context, or \ncomplexity of thought. Therefore, it is best practice to \nreview LLM responses for clarity and accuracy before \nusing them. Additionally, LLM responses are highly \ndependent upon prompts received. Responses also change \neach time they’re provided, even if the same prompt is \nprovided, whether by the same or different individuals. \nCONCLUSION \nThis project demonstrates a practical example of how \nlibrarians can apply generative artificial intelligence (AI) \ntechnologies to routine tasks like LibGuide revision and \ncontent creation. Using LLMs to develop page \nVirtual Projects are published on an annual basis in the Journal of the Medical Library Association (JMLA) following an annual call for virtual \nprojects in MLAConnect and announcements to encourage submissions from all types of libraries. An advisory committee of recognized \ntechnology experts selects project entries based on their currency, innovation, and contribution to health sciences librarianship. \nVirtual projects  97  \nDOI: dx.doi.org/10.5195/jmla.2025.2084  \n \njmla.mlanet.org  113 (1) January 2025 Journal of the Medical Library Association  \n \nintroductions and to reorganize content resulted in a \nusage increase. While not causative, while not causative, \nthis increase may be correlated to increased \ndiscoverability and usability from using generative AI \ndeveloped text and suggestions. LLMs can enhance the \ninstructional component of LibGuides without adding a \nsignificant time burden for the creator. \nREFERENCES \n1. OpenAI.
