    "abstract": "To identify the four typical faults of dry-type transformer winding insulations, looseness, deformation and eccentricity, this study establishes the electric magnetic force multi-physical field simulation model of a dry-type transformer winding under the four typical faults with COMSOL software, based on the vibration mechanism of an SCB10-1000/10 dry-type transformer. Through the multi-physical field coupling calculation, the comparative relationship between the vibration acceleration of the winding under the four kinds of faults and the normal working state is obtained. The results show that the amplitude growth rate of the fundamental frequency or harmonic frequency of the acceleration signal under four kinds of faults is different from that under normal conditions. Therefore, the threshold value of the fundamental frequency or harmonic increment of the acceleration signal is introduced to describe the growth rate of the acceleration signal relative to normal conditions. Finally, four typical faults are identified with different threshold ranges of acceleration increment under faults, laying a foundation for the fault diagnosis of transformer winding vibrations.",
