Nevertheless, they\ndepend heavily on human-written instruction\ndata that is often limited in quantity, diversity,\nand creativity, therefore hindering the general-\nity of the tuned model. We introduce SELF -\nINSTRUCT , a framework for improving the\ninstruction-following capabilities of pretrained\nlanguage models by bootstrapping off their\nown generations. Our pipeline generates in-\nstructions, input, and output samples from a\nlanguage model, then filters invalid or similar\nones before using them to finetune the original\nmodel. Applying our method to the vanilla\nGPT3 , we demonstrate a 33% absolute im-\nprovement over the original model on SUPER -\nNATURAL INSTRUCTIONS , on par with the\nperformance of InstructGPT001,1 which was\ntrained with private user data and human anno-\ntations. For further evaluation, we curate a set\nof expert-written instructions for novel tasks,\nand show through human evaluation that tun-\ning GPT3 with SELF -INSTRUCT outperforms\nusing existing public instruction datasets by\na large margin, leaving only a 5% absolute\ngap behind InstructGPT001. SELF -INSTRUCT\nprovides an almost annotation-free method for\naligning pretrained language models with in-\nstructions, and we release our large synthetic\ndataset to facilitate future studies on instruction\ntuning.2\n1 Introduction\nThe recent NLP literature has witnessed a tremen-\ndous amount of activity in building models that can\n1Unless otherwise specified, our comparisons are with\ntext-davinci-001 engine.

These developments are powered by two\nkey components: large pretrained language mod-\nels (LM) and human-written instruction data (e.g.,\nPROMPT SOURCE (Bach et al., 2022) and SUPER -\nNATURAL INSTRUCTIONS (Wang et al., 2022, SU-\nPER NI for short)). However, collecting such in-\nstruction data is costly and often suffers limited\ndiversity given that most human generations tend\nto be popular NLP tasks, falling short of cover-\ning a true variety of tasks and different ways to\n13484\n175seed tasks with1instructionand1instancepertaskTask PoolStep1:InstructionGeneration\nNo\nStep4:Filtering Output-first\nInput-first\nStep2:ClassificationTaskIdentification\nStep3:InstanceGeneration\nInstruction :Give me a quote from a famous person on this topic.Task\nYes\nTaskInstruction :Give me a quote from a famous person on this topic.Input:Topic: The importance of being honest.Output:\"Honesty is the first chapter in the book of wisdom.\" -Thomas Jefferson\nTaskTaskInstruction :Find out if the given text is in favor of or against abortion.Class Label: Pro-abortionInput:Text: I believe that women should have the right to choose whether or notthey want to have an abortion.\nTask\nLM LM\nLM\n🤖\n 🤖\n🤖\nFigure 2: A high-level overview of SELF -INSTRUCT . The process starts with a small seed set of tasks as the task\npool. Random tasks are sampled from the task pool, and used to prompt an off-the-shelf LM to generate both new\ninstructions and corresponding instances, followed by filtering low-quality or similar generations, and then added\nback to the initial repository of tasks. The resulting data can be used for the instruction tuning of the language model\nitself later to follow instructions better. Tasks shown in the figure are generated by GPT3.\ndescribe them. Continuing to improve the quality\nand coverage of instruction-tuned models necessi-\ntates the development of alternative approaches for\nsupervising the instruction tuning process.\nIn this work, we introduce SELF -INSTRUCT ,\na semi-automated process for instruction-tuning\na pretrained LM using instructional signals from\nthe model itself. The overall process is an itera-\ntive bootstrapping algorithm (see Figure 2), which\nstarts off with a limited (e.g., 175 in our study)\nseed set of manually-written tasks that are used to\nguide the overall generation. In the first phase, the\nmodel is prompted to generate instructions for new\ntasks. This step leverages the existing collection\nof instructions to create more broad-coverage in-\nstructions that define (often new) tasks. Given the\nnewly-generated set of instructions, the framework\nalso creates input-output instances for them, which\ncan be later used for supervising the instruction\ntuning. Finally, various heuristics are used to auto-\nmatically filter low-quality or repeated instructions,\nbefore adding the remaining valid tasks to the task\npool. This process can be repeated for many itera-\ntions until reaching a large number of tasks.\nTo evaluate SELF -INSTRUCT empirically, we\nrun this framework on GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020),\nwhich is a vanilla LM (§3). The iterative SELF -\nINSTRUCT process on this model leads to about 52k\ninstructions, paired with about 82K instance inputs\nand target outputs. We observe that the resulting\ndata provides a diverse range of creative tasks, as\nis demonstrated by examples in Figure 1. These\ngenerated tasks deviate from the distribution of typ-\nical NLP tasks, and also have fairly small overlap\nwith the seed tasks (§3.2). On this resulting data,\nwe build GPT3 SELF -INST by finetuning GPT3 (i.e.,\nthe same model used for generating the instruction\ndata). We evaluateGPT3 SELF -INST in comparison to\nvarious other models on both typical NLP tasks in-\ncluded in SUPER NI (Wang et al., 2022), and a set of\nnew instructions that are created for novel usage of\ninstruction-following models (§4). The results in-\ndicate that GPT3 SELF -INST outperforms GPT3 (the\noriginal model) by a large margin (+33.1%) and\nnearly matches the performance of InstructGPT001.\nMoreover, our human evaluation on the newly-\ncreated instruction set shows that GPT3 SELF -INST\ndemonstrates a broad range of instruction follow-\ning ability, outperforming models trained on other\npublicly available instruction datasets and leaving\nonly a 5% gap behind InstructGPT001.\nIn summary, our contributions are: (1) we in-\ntroduce SELF -INSTRUCT , a method for induc-\ning instruction following capabilities with mini-\nmal human-labeled data; (2) we demonstrate its\neffectiveness via extensive instruction-tuning ex-\nperiments; and (3) we release a large synthetic\ndataset of 52K instructions and a set of manually-\nwritten novel tasks for building and evaluating fu-\nture instruction-following models.\n13485\n2 Method\nAnnotating large-scale instruction data can be chal-\nlenging for humans because it requires 1) creativity\nto come up with novel tasks and 2) expertise for\nwriting the solutions to each task. Here, we de-\ntail our process for SELF -INSTRUCT , which refers\nto the pipeline of generating tasks with a vanilla\npretrained language model itself, filtering the gen-\nerated data, and then conducting instruction tuning\nwith this generated data in order to align the LM to\nfollow instructions better. This pipeline is depicted\nin Figure 2.\n2.1 Defining Instruction Data\nThe instruction data we want to generate con-\ntains a set of instructions {It}, each of which\ndefines a task t in natural language. Task t has\nnt ≥1 input-output instances {(Xt,i,Yt,i)}nt\ni=1. A\nmodel M is expected to produce the output, given\nthe task instruction and the corresponding input:\nM(It,Xt,i) = Yt,i, for i∈{1,...,n t}. Note that\nthe instruction and instance input does not have a\nstrict boundary in many cases. For example, “write\nan essay about school safety” can be a valid instruc-\ntion that we expect models to respond to directly,\nwhile it can also be formulated as “write an essay\nabout the following topic” as the instruction, and\n“school safety” as an instance input. To encourage\nthe diversity of the data format, we allow such in-\nstructions that do not require additional input (i.e.,\nX is empty).\n2.2 Automatic Instruction Data Generation\nOur pipeline for data generation consists of four\nsteps: 1) generating task instructions, 2) determin-\ning if the instruction represents a classification task,\n3) instance generation with either an input-first or\noutput-first approach, and 4) filtering low-quality\ndata.\nInstruction Generation. At the first step, SELF -\nINSTRUCT generates new instructions from a small\nset of seed human-written instructions in a boot-\nstrapping fashion. We initiate the task pool with\n175 tasks (1 instruction and 1 instance for each\ntask).3 For every step, we sample 8 task instruc-\ntions from this pool as in-context examples. Of\n3These tasks were newly written by the authors and their\nlabmates at UW, without reference to existing datasets or the\ntest set used in this work. We provide more details about these\ntasks and analyze their similarity to the test tasks in Appendix\n§A.1.\nthe 8 instructions, 6 are from the human-written\ntasks, and 2 are from the model-generated tasks in\nprevious steps to promote diversity. The prompting\ntemplate is shown in Table 5.\nClassification Task Identification. Because we\nneed two different approaches for classification and\nnon-classification tasks, we next identify whether\nthe generated instruction represents a classification\ntask or not.4 We prompt the LM in a few-shot way\nto determine this, using 12 classification instruc-\ntions and 19 non-classification instructions from\nthe seed tasks. The prompting template is shown\nin Table 6.\nInstance Generation. Given the instructions and\ntheir task type, we generate instances for each in-\nstruction independently. This is challenging be-\ncause it requires the model to understand what the\ntarget task is, based on the instruction, figure out\nwhat additional input fields are needed and gener-\nate them, and finally complete the task by produc-\ning the output. We found that pretrained LMs can\nachieve this to a large extent when prompted with\ninstruction-input-output in-context examples from\nother tasks. A natural way to do this is the Input-\nfirst Approach, where we can ask an LM to come\nup with the input fields first based on the instruc-\ntion, and then produce the corresponding output.\nThis generation order is similar to how models are\nused to respond to instruction and input, but here\nwith in-context examples from other tasks. The\nprompting template is shown in Table 7.\nHowever, we found that this approach can gen-\nerate inputs biased toward one label, especially\nfor classification tasks (e.g., for grammar error de-\ntection, it usually generates grammatical input).\nTherefore, we additionally propose anOutput-first\nApproach for classification tasks, where we first\ngenerate the possible class labels, and then condi-\ntion the input generation on each class label. The\nprompting template is shown in Table 8.5 We ap-\nply the output-first approach to the classification\ntasks identified in the former step, and the input-\nfirst approach to the remaining non-classification\ntasks.\n4More concretely, we regard tasks that have a small limited\noutput label space as classification tasks.\n5In this work, we use a fixed set of seed tasks for prompt-\ning the instance generation, and thus only generate a small\nnumber of instances per task in one round. Future work can\nuse randomly sampled tasks to prompt the model to generate\na larger number of instances in multiple rounds.\n13486\nFiltering and Postprocessing. To encourage di-\nversity, a new instruction is added to the task pool\nonly when its ROUGE-L similarity with any exist-\ning instruction is less than 0.7. We also exclude\ninstructions that contain some specific keywords\n(e.g., image, picture, graph) that usually can not be\nprocessed by LMs. When generating new instances\nfor each instruction, we filter out instances that are\nexactly the same or those with the same input but\ndifferent outputs. Invalid generations are identified\nand filtered out based on heuristics (e.g., instruc-\ntion is too long or too short, instance output is a\nrepetition of the input).\n2.3 Finetuning the LM to Follow Instructions\nAfter creating large-scale instruction data, we use it\nto finetune the original LM (i.e., SELF -INSTRUCT ).\nTo do this, we concatenate the instruction and in-\nstance input as a prompt and train the model to\ngenerate the instance output in a standard super-\nvised way. To make the model robust to different\nformats, we use multiple templates to encode the\ninstruction and instance input together. For exam-\nple, the instruction can be prefixed with “Task:” or\nnot, the input can be prefixed with “Input:” or not,\n“Output:” can be appended at the end of the prompt\nor not, and different numbers of break lines can be\nput in the middle, etc.\n3 S ELF -INSTRUCT Data from GPT3\nIn this section, we apply our method for inducing\ninstruction data to GPT3 as a case study. We use\nthe largest GPT3 LM (“davinci” engine) accessed\nthrough the OpenAI API.6 The parameters for mak-\ning queries are described in Appendix A.2. Here\nwe present an overview of the generated data.\n3.1 Statistics\nTable 1 describes the basic statistics of the gener-\nated data. We generate a total of over 52K instruc-\ntions and more than 82K instances corresponding\nto these instructions after filtering.\n3.2 Diversity\nTo study what types of instructions are generated\nand how diverse they are, we identify the verb-noun\nstructure in the generated instructions. We use the\nBerkeley Neural Parser7 (Kitaev and Klein, 2018;\nKitaev et al., 2019) to parse the instructions and\n6https://openai.com/api/\n7https://parser.kitaev.io/\nstatistic\n# of instructions 52,445\n- # of classification instructions 11,584\n- # of non-classification instructions 40,861\n# of instances 82,439\n- # of instances with empty input 35,878\nave. instruction length (in words) 15.9\nave. non-empty input length (in words) 12.7\nave. output length (in words) 18.9\nTable 1: Statistics of the generated data by applying\nSELF -INSTRUCT to GPT3.\nthen extract the verb that is closest to the root as\nwell as its first direct noun object. 26,559 out of the\n52,445 instructions contain such structure; other\ninstructions usually contain more complex clauses\n(e.g., “Classify whether this tweet contains political\ncontent or not.”) or are framed as questions (e.g.,\n“Which of these statements are true?”). We plot\nthe top 20 most common root verbs and their top 4\ndirect noun objects in Figure 3, which account for\n14% of the entire set. Overall, we see quite diverse\nintents and textual formats in these instructions.\nWe further study how the generated instructions\ndiffer from the seed instructions used to prompt\nthe generation. For each generated instruction, we\ncompute its highest ROUGE-L overlap with the\n175 seed instructions. We plot the distribution of\nthese ROUGE-L scores in Figure 4. The results\nindicate a decent number of new instructions were\ngenerated, which do not have much overlap with\nthe seeds. We also demonstrate diversity in the\nlength of the instructions, instance inputs, and in-\nstance outputs in Figure 5.\n3.3 Quality\nSo far, we have shown the quantity and diversity\nof the generated data, but its quality remains un-\ncertain. To investigate this, we randomly sample\n200 instructions and randomly select 1 instance\nper instruction. We asked an expert annotator (au-\nthor of this work) to label whether each instance\nis correct or not, in terms of the instruction, the\ninstance input, and the instance output. Evaluation\nresults in Table 2 show that most of the generated\ninstructions are meaningful, while the generated\ninstances may contain more noise (to a reasonable\nextent). However, we found that even though the\ngenerations may contain errors, most of them are\nstill in the correct format or partially correct, which\ncan provide useful guidance for training models to\nfollow instructions. We listed a number of good\n13487\nwrite give \nfind \ncreate make \nd e s c r i b e \nd e s i g n \ng e n e r a t e \nc l a s s i f y \nh a v e \nexplain t e l l \ni d e n t i f y \noutput \np r e d i c t \nd e t e c t \nfunction \nessay \nletter \nparagraph \nexample \nlist \nset \na d v i c e \nword \nnumber \ns e n t e n c e \nway \nprogram \nlist \na l g o r i t h m \nf u n c t i o n \nlist \n s t o r y \ns e n t e n c e \np r o g r a m \nsituation \np e r s o n \np r o c e s s \nt i m e \ns y s t e m \ng a m e \na l g o r i t h m \ns t r u c t u r e \nl i s t \nn u m b e r \ns e n t e n c e \ns e r i e s \ns e n t e n c e \ns e n t i m e n t \na r t i c l e \nt e x t \nl i s t \narray \nc o i n \ns e t \nd i f f e r e n c e \nc o n c e p t \ns t o r y \nj o k e \ns e n t i m e n t \nt o p i c \nn u m b e r \nw o r d \ns e n t i m e n t \ns a r c a s m \nFigure 3: The top 20 most common root verbs (inner circle) and\ntheir top 4 direct noun objects (outer circle) in the generated\ninstructions.

We first describe our models\nand other baselines, followed by our experiments.\n4.1 GPT3 SELF -INST : finetuning GPT3 on its\nown instruction data\nGiven the instruction-generated instruction data,\nwe conduct instruction tuning with the GPT3\nmodel itself (“davinci” engine). As described in\n§2.3, we use various templates to concatenate the\ninstruction and input, and train the model to gen-\nerate the output. This finetuning is done through\nthe OpenAI finetuning API. 8 We use the default\nhyper-parameters, except that we set the prompt\nloss weight to 0, and we train the model for 2\nepochs. We refer the reader to Appendix A.3 for\nadditional finetuning details. The resulting model\nis denoted by GPT3 SELF -INST .\n4.2 Baselines\nOff-the-shelf LMs. We evaluate T5-LM (Lester\net al., 2021; Raffel et al., 2020) and GPT3 (Brown\net al., 2020) as the vanilla LM baselines (only pre-\ntraining, no additional finetuning). These baselines\nwill indicate the extent to which off-the-shelf LMs\nare capable of following instructions naturally im-\nmediately after pretraining.\nPublicly available instruction-tuned models.\nT0 and Tk-INSTRUCT are two instruction-tuned\nmodels proposed in Sanh et al. (2022) and Wang\net al. (2022), respectively, and are demonstrated\nto be able to follow instructions for many NLP\ntasks. Both of these models are finetuned from the\n8See OpenAI’s documentation on finetuning.\n13488\nT5 (Raffel et al., 2020) checkpoints and are pub-\nlicly available.9 For both of these models, we use\ntheir largest version with 11B parameters.\nInstruction-tuned GPT3 models. We evaluate\nInstructGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022), which is de-\nveloped by OpenAI based on GPT3 to follow hu-\nman instructions better and has been found by\nthe community to have impressive zero-shot abil-\nities. There are various generations of these mod-\nels, where newer ones use more expansive data\nor algorithmic novelties.10 For our SUPER NI ex-\nperiments in §4.3, we only compare with their\ntext-davinci-001 engine, because their newer\nengines are trained with the latest user data and are\nlikely to have already seen the SUPER NI test set.\nFor our human evaluation on newly written instruc-\ntions, we include their 001, 002 and 003 engines\nfor completeness.\nAdditionally, to compare SELF -INSTRUCT train-\ning with other publicly available instruction tuning\ndata, we further finetune GPT3 model with data\nfrom PROMPT SOURCE and SUPER NI, which are\nused to train the T0 and Tk-INSTRUCT models.\nWe call them T0 training and SUPER NI training\nfor short, respectively. To save the training bud-\nget, we sampled 50K instances (but covering all\ntheir instructions) for each dataset, which has a\ncomparable size to the instruction data we gener-\nated. Based on the findings from Wang et al. (2022)\nand our early experiments, reducing the number of\ninstances per task does not degrade the model’s\ngeneralization performance to unseen tasks.\n4.3 Experiment 1: Zero-Shot Generalization\non SUPER NI benchmark\nWe first evaluate the models’ ability to follow in-\nstructions on typical NLP tasks in a zero-shot fash-\nion. We use the evaluation set of SUPER NI (Wang\net al., 2022), which consists of 119 tasks with 100\ninstances in each task. In this work, we mainly\nfocus on the zero-shot setup, i.e., the model is\nprompted with the definition of the tasks only, with-\nout in-context demonstration examples. For all our\nrequests to the GPT3 variants, we use the deter-\nministic generation mode (temperature as 0 and no\nnucleus sampling) without specific stop sequences.\nResults. We make the following observations\nfrom the results in Table 3.

The vanilla GPT3 model basically\ncannot follow human instructions at all. Upon man-\nual analysis, we find that it usually generates irrele-\nvant and repetitive text, and does not know when\nto stop generation. Compared with other mod-\nels that are not specifically trained for SUPER NI,\nGPT3 SELF -INST achieves better performance than\nT0 or the GPT3 finetuned on the T0 training set,\nwhich takes tremendous human labeling efforts.\nNotably, GPT3 SELF -INST also nearly matches the\nperformance of InstructGPT001, which is trained\nwith private user data and human-annotated labels.\nModels trained on the SUPER NI training set still\nachieve better performance on its evaluation set,\nwhich we attribute to the similar instruction style\nand formatting. However, we show that SELF -\nINSTRUCT still brings in additional gains when\ncombined with the SUPER NI training set, proving\nits value as complementary data.\n4.4 Experiment 2: Generalization to\nUser-oriented Instructions on Novel Tasks\nDespite the comprehensiveness of SUPER NI in col-\nlecting existing NLP tasks, most of these NLP tasks\nwere proposed for research purposes and skewed\ntoward classification. To better access the practi-\ncal value of instruction-following models, a sub-\nset of the authors curate a new set of instructions\nmotivated by user-oriented applications. We first\nbrainstorm various domains where large LMs may\nbe useful (e.g., email writing, social media, pro-\nductivity tools, entertainment, programming), then\n13489\nVanillaGPT3GPT3+T0TrainingGPT3+SuperNITrainingGPT3Self-Inst+SuperNIGPT3Self-InstInstructGPT001InstructGPT002InstructGPT003\n187\n118\n68\n31 25 18 10 2\n64\n59\n80\n84\n66 61\n34 28\n1\n31\n30 54\n49\n45\n40\n30\n0\n44 74 83 112 128 168 192\n0%\n25%\n50%\n75%\n100%\nGPT3\nT0 Training\nSuperNI Training\nSelf-Instruct + SuperNI\nSelf-InstructInstructGPT-001InstructGPT-002InstructGPT-003\ncorrect and satisfying responseacceptable response with minor imperfections\nresponds to the instruction but has significant errors  irrelevant or invalid response\n186\n117\n68\n31 25 18 10 2\n64\n59\n80\n84\n66 61\n34 28\n1\n31\n30 54\n48\n44\n39\n30\n0\n44 74 83 113 129 169 192\n0%\n25%\n50%\n75%\n100%\nGPT3\nT0 Training\nSuperNI Training\nSelf-Instruct + SuperNI\nSelf-InstructInstructGPT-001InstructGPT-002InstructGPT-003\ncorrect and satisfying responseacceptable response with minor imperfections\nresponds to the instruction but has significant errors  irrelevant or invalid responseC:respondstotheinstructionbuthassignificanterrorsA:correctandsatisfyingresponse\n186\n117\n68\n31 25 18 10 2\n64\n59\n80\n84\n66 61\n34 28\n1\n31\n30 54\n48\n44\n39\n30\n0\n44 74 83 113 129 169 192\n0%\n25%\n50%\n75%\n100%\nGPT3\nT0 Training\nSuperNI Training\nSelf-Instruct + SuperNI\nSelf-InstructInstructGPT-001InstructGPT-002InstructGPT-003\ncorrect and satisfying responseacceptable response with minor imperfections\nresponds to the instruction but has significant errors  irrelevant or invalid response\nB:acceptableresponsewithminorimperfections\n186\n117\n68\n31 25 18 10 2\n64\n59\n80\n84\n66 61\n34 28\n1\n31\n30 54\n48\n44\n39\n30\n0\n44 74 83 113 129 169 192\n0%\n25%\n50%\n75%\n100%\nGPT3\nT0 Training\nSuperNI Training\nSelf-Instruct + SuperNI\nSelf-InstructInstructGPT-001InstructGPT-002InstructGPT-003\ncorrect and satisfying responseacceptable response with minor imperfections\nresponds to the instruction but has significant errors  irrelevant or invalid responseD:irrelevantorinvalidresponse\n186\n117\n68\n31 25 18 10 2\n64\n59\n80\n84\n66 61\n34 28\n1\n31\n30 54\n48\n44\n39\n30\n0\n44 74 83 113 129 169 192\n0%\n25%\n50%\n75%\n100%\nGPT3\nT0 Training\nSuperNI Training\nSelf-Instruct + SuperNI\nSelf-InstructInstructGPT-001InstructGPT-002InstructGPT-003\ncorrect and satisfying responseacceptable response with minor imperfections\nresponds to the instruction but has significant errors  irrelevant or invalid response\n186\n117\n68\n31 25 18 10 2\n64\n59\n80\n84\n66 61\n34 28\n1\n31\n30 54\n49\n45\n40\n30\n0\n44 74 83 112 128 168 192\n0%\n25%\n50%\n75%\n100%\nGPT3\nT0 Training\nSuperNI Training\nSelf-Instruct + SuperNI\nSelf-InstructInstructGPT-001InstructGPT-002InstructGPT-003\ncorrect and satisfying responseacceptable response with minor imperfections\nresponds to the instruction but has significant errors  irrelevant or invalid response\nFigure 6: Performance of GPT3 model and its instruction-tuned variants, evaluated by human experts on our 252\nuser-oriented instructions (§4.4). Human evaluators are instructed to rate the models’ responses into four levels. The\nresults indicate that GPT3 SELF -INST outperforms all the other GPT3 variants trained on publicly available instruction\ndatasets. Additionally, GPT3 SELF -INST scores nearly as good as InstructGPT001 (cf. footnote 1).\ncraft instructions related to each domain along with\nan input-output instance (again, input is optional).\nWe aim to diversify the styles and formats of these\ntasks (e.g., instructions may be long or short; in-\nput/output may take the form of bullet points, ta-\nbles, codes, equations, etc.). In total, we create 252\ninstructions with 1 instance per instruction. We\nbelieve it can serve as a testbed for evaluating how\ninstruction-based models handle diverse and unfa-\nmiliar instructions. Table 9 presents a small portion\nof them. The entire set is available in our GitHub\nrepository. We analyze the overlap between this set\nset and the seed instructions in §A.1.\nHuman evaluation setup. Evaluating models’\nperformance on this evaluation set of diverse tasks\nis extremely challenging because different tasks\nrequire different expertise. Indeed, many of these\ntasks cannot be measured by automatic metrics or\neven be judged by normal crowdworkers (e.g., writ-\ning a program or converting first-order logic into\nnatural language). To get a more faithful evalua-\ntion, we asked the authors of the instructions to\njudge model predictions. Details on how we set up\nthis human evaluation are described in Appendix B.\nThe evaluators were asked to rate the output based\non whether it accurately and effectively completes\nthe task. We implemented a four-level rating sys-\ntem for categorizing the quality of models’ outputs:\n• RATING -A: The response is valid and satisfying.\n• RATING -B: The response is acceptable but has\nminor errors or imperfections.\n• RATING -C: The response is relevant and re-\nsponds to the instruction, but it has significant\nerrors in the content. For example, GPT3 might\ngenerate a valid output first, but continue to gen-\nerate other irrelevant things.\n• RATING -D: The response is irrelevant or com-\npletely invalid.\nResults. Figure 6 shows the performance of\nGPT3 model and its instruction-tuned counterparts\non this newly written instruction set (w. inter-\nrater agreement κ = 0 .57 on the 4-class cate-\ngorical scale, see Appendix B for details). As\nanticipated, the vanilla GPT3 LM is largely un-\nable to respond to instructions, and all instruction-\ntuned models demonstrate comparatively higher\nperformance. Nonetheless, GPT3 SELF -INST (i.e.,\nGPT3 model finetuned with SELF -INSTRUCT )\noutperforms those counterparts trained on T0 or\nSUPER NI data by a large margin, demonstrating\nthe value of the generated data despite the noise.\nCompared with InstructGPT001, GPT3 SELF -INST is\nquite close in performance—if we count accept-\nable response with minor imperfections (RATING -\nB) as valid, GPT3 SELF -INST is only 5% behind\nInstructGPT001. Lastly, our evaluation confirms\nthe impressive instruction-following ability of\nInstructGPT002 and InstructGPT003. Although\nthere are many factors behind this success, we con-\njecture that future work can largely benefit from\nimproving the quality of our generated data by us-\ning human annotators or training a reward model to\nselect better generations, similar to the algorithm\nused by Ouyang et al. (2022).\n13490\n4.5 Effect of Data Size and Quality\nData size. SELF -INSTRUCT provides a way to\ngrow instruction data at a low cost with almost no\nhuman labeling; could more of this generated data\nlead to better instruction-following ability? We an-\nalyze the size of generated data by subsampling dif-\nferent numbers of instructions from the generated\ndataset, finetuning GPT3 on the sampled subsets,\nand evaluating how the resulting models perform\non the 252 user-oriented instruction set. We con-\nduct the same human evaluation as in §4.4. Figure 7\npresents the performance of GPT3 SELF -INST mod-\nels finetuned with different sizes of generated data.\nOverall, we see consistent improvement as we grow\nthe data size. However, this improvement almost\nplateaus after 16K. This is in-line with the data\nscaling experiments in Wang et al. (2022, Fig. 5).\nInterestingly, when evaluating on SUPER NI we\nfound the model’s performance gain plateaus ear-\nlier at around hundreds of instructions. This may\nbe due to the fact that the new generated data is\ndistinct from typical NLP tasks in SUPER NI, indi-\ncating that future research may benefit from using a\ncombination of different instruction data for better\nperformance on various types of tasks.\nData quality. Another direction to improve the\nmodel’s performance is to take our generated data\nand get better supervision (with less noise). We\nexplore this idea by using InstructGPT003 (the best\navailable general-purpose model) to regenerate the\noutput field of all our instances given the instruc-\ntion and input. We then use this improved ver-\nsion of our data to finetune GPT3 . As is shown\nin Figure 7, the resulting model outperforms the\ncounterpart trained with the original data by 10%,\nwhich suggests big room for future work on using\nour generation pipeline to get initial data and then\nimproving the data quality with human experts or\ndistillation from better models.\n5 Related Work\nInstruction-following LMs. A series of works\nhave found evidence that vanilla LMs can be effec-\ntive at following general language instructions if\ntuned with annotated “instructional” data—datasets\ncontaining language instructional commands and\ntheir desired outcomes based on human annota-\ntion (Weller et al., 2020; Mishra et al., 2022; Wei\net al., 2022; Sanh et al., 2022, i.a.). Additionally,\nthey show a direct correlation between the size and\n31.0%36.9%43.7%44.4%54.4%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n100800640051200\nPercentageofResponsesRatedasA\nNumberofInstructions\n  w.

We see consistent\nimprovement from using larger data with better quality.\ndiversity of the “instructional” data and the general-\nizability of resulting models to unseen tasks (Wang\net al., 2022; Chung et al., 2022). However, since\nthese developments largely focus on existing NLP\ntasks and depend on human-annotated instructions,\nthis poses a bottleneck for progress toward more\ngeneralizable models (e.g., see Fig. 5a in Wang\net al., 2022). Our work aims to move beyond classi-\ncal NLP tasks and tackle the challenges of creating\ndiverse instruction data by employing pretrained\nLMs. InstructGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022) shares\na similar goal as ours in building more general-\npurpose LMs, and has demonstrated remarkable\nperformance in following diverse user instructions.\nHowever, as a commercial system, their construc-\ntion process still remains quite opaque. In partic-\nular, the role of data has remained understudied\ndue to limited transparency and the private user\ndata they used in their study. Addressing such chal-\nlenges necessitates the creation of a large-scale,\npublic dataset covering a broad range of tasks.\nLanguage models for data generation and aug-\nmentation. A variety of works have proposed us-\ning LMs for data generation (Schick and Schütze,\n2021; Wang et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022; Meng\net al., 2023) or augmentation (Feng et al., 2021;\nYang et al., 2020; Mekala et al., 2022). Our work\ndiffers from this line in that it isnot specific to a par-\nticular task (say, QA or NLI). In contrast, a distinct\n13491\nmotivation for SELF -INSTRUCT is to bootstrap new\ntask definitions that may not have been defined be-\nfore by NLP practitioners (though potentially still\nimportant for real users). In parallel with our work,\nHonovich et al. (2022a) also propose to generate\nlarge-scale instruction data (so-called Unnatural\nInstructions) with GPT3 models. The major differ-\nences are that 1) they use tasks in SUPER NI (Wang\net al., 2022) as their seed tasks, resulting in a differ-\nent distribution of generated tasks; 2) they employ\nInstructGPT002 for generating the data, in which\nsense they are distilling knowledge from an already\ninstruction-tuned model, while we solely rely on\nthe vanilla LM; 3) the detailed generation pipeline\nand templates are different. Nevertheless, we be-\nlieve that both efforts in expanding instruction data\nare complementary, and the community will benefit\nfrom these diverse datasets.\nInstruction generation. A series of recent\nworks (Zhou et al., 2022b; Ye et al., 2022; Singh\net al., 2022; Honovich et al., 2022b) generate in-\nstructions of a task given a few examples. While\nSELF -INSTRUCT also involves instruction gener-\nation, a major difference in our case is it is task-\nagnostic; we generate new tasks (instructions along\nwith instances) from scratch.\nModel self-training. A typical self-training\nframework (He et al., 2019; Xie et al., 2020; Du\net al., 2021; Amini et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2022)\nuses trained models to assign labels to unlabeled\ndata and then leverages the pseudo-labeled data to\nimprove the model. Zhou et al. (2022a) use mul-\ntiple prompts to specify a single task and propose\nto regularize via prompt consistency, encouraging\nconsistent predictions over the prompts. This al-\nlows either finetuning the model with extra unla-\nbeled training data, or direct application at infer-\nence time. While SELF -INSTRUCT has similarities\nwith the self-training literature, most self-training\nmethods assume a specific target task as well as\nunlabeled examples under it; in contrast, SELF -\nINSTRUCT produces a variety of tasks from scratch.\nKnowledge distillation. Knowledge distilla-\ntion (Hinton et al., 2015; Sanh et al., 2019; West\net al., 2021; Magister et al., 2022) often involves\nthe transfer of knowledge from larger models to\nsmaller ones. SELF -INSTRUCT can also be viewed\nas a form of “knowledge distillation\", however, it\ndiffers from this line in the following ways: (1) the\nsource and target of distillation are the same, i.e., a\nmodel’s knowledge is distilled to itself; (2) the con-\ntent of distillation is in the form of an instruction\ntask (i.e., instructions that define a task, and a set\nof examples that instantiate it).\nBootstrapping with limited resources. A se-\nries of recent works use language models to boot-\nstrap some inferences using specialized methods.\nNPPrompt (Zhao et al., 2022) provides a method\nto generate predictions for semantic labels without\nany finetuning. It uses a model’s own embeddings\nto automatically find words relevant to the label of\nthe data sample and hence reduces the dependency\non manual mapping from model prediction to la-\nbel (verbalizers). STAR (Zelikman et al., 2022)\niteratively leverages a small number of rationale\nexamples and a large dataset without rationales,\nto bootstrap a model’s ability to perform reason-\ning. Self-Correction (Welleck et al., 2023) decou-\nples an imperfect base generator (model) from a\nseparate corrector that learns to iteratively correct\nimperfect generations and demonstrates improve-\nment over the base generator. Our work instead\nfocuses on bootstrapping new tasks in the instruc-\ntion paradigm.\nMulti-modal instruction-following. Instruction-\nfollowing models have also been of interest in the\nmulti-modal learning literature (Fried et al., 2018;\nShridhar et al., 2020; Min et al., 2022; Weir et al.,\n2022). SELF -INSTRUCT , as a general approach to\nexpanding data, can potentially also be helpful in\nthose settings, which we leave to future work.\n6 Conclusion\nWe introduce SELF -INSTRUCT , a method to im-\nprove the instruction-following ability of LMs via\ntheir own generation of instruction data. On ex-\nperimenting with vanilla GPT3 , we automatically\nconstruct a large-scale dataset of 52K instructions\nfor diverse tasks, and finetuning GPT3 on this data\nleads to a 33% absolute improvement on SUPER NI\nover the original GPT3 . Furthermore, we curate\na set of expert-written instructions for novel tasks.\nHuman evaluation on this set shows that tuning\nGPT3 with SELF -INSTRUCT outperforms using ex-\nisting public instruction datasets by a large margin\nand performs closely to InstructGPT001. We hope\nSELF -INSTRUCT can serve as the first step to align\npretrained LMs to follow human instructions, and\nfuture work can build on top of this data to improve\ninstruction-following models.\n13492\n7 Broader Impact\nBeyond the immediate focus of this paper, we\nbelieve that SELF -INSTRUCT may help bring\nmore transparency to what happens “behind the\nscenes” of widely-used instruction-tuned models\nlike InstructGPT or ChatGPT. Unfortunately, such\nindustrial models remain behind API walls as their\ndatasets are not released, and hence there is lit-\ntle understanding of their construction and why\nthey demonstrate impressive capabilities. The bur-\nden now falls on academia to better understand the\nsource of success in these models and strive for\nbetter—and more open—models. We believe our\nfindings in this paper demonstrate the importance\nof diverse instruction data, and our large synthetic\ndataset can be the first step toward higher-quality\ndata for building better instruction-following mod-\nels. At this writing, the central idea of this paper\nhas been adopted in several follow-up works for\nsuch endeavors (Taori et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023;\nSun et al., 2023, i.a.).\n8 Limitations\nHere, we discuss some limitations of this work to\ninspire future research in this direction.\nTail phenomena. SELF -INSTRUCT depends on\nLMs, and it will inherit all the limitations that\ncarry over with LMs. As recent studies have\nshown (Razeghi et al., 2022; Kandpal et al., 2022),\ntail phenomena pose a serious challenge to the suc-\ncess of LMs. In other words, LMs’ largest gains\ncorrespond to the frequent uses of languages (head\nof the language use distribution), and there might\nbe minimal gains in the low-frequency contexts.\nSimilarly, in the context of this work, it would not\nbe surprising if the majority of the gains by SELF -\nINSTRUCT are skewed toward tasks or instructions\nthat present more frequently in the pretraining cor-\npus. As a consequence, the approach might show\nbrittleness with respect to uncommon and creative\ninstructions.\nDependence on large models. Because of SELF -\nINSTRUCT ’s dependence on the inductive biases\nextracted from LMs, it might work best for larger\nmodels. If true, this may create barriers to ac-\ncess for those who may not have large comput-\ning resources. We hope future studies will care-\nfully study the gains as a function of model size\nor various other parameters. It is worthwhile to\nnote that instruction-tuning with human annota-\ntion also suffers from a similar limitation: gains of\ninstruction-tuning are higher for larger models (Wei\net al., 2022).\nReinforcing LM biases. A point of concern for\nthe authors is the unintended consequences of\nthis iterative algorithm, such as the amplification\nof problematic social biases (stereotypes or slurs\nabout gender, race, etc.). Relatedly, one observed\nchallenge in this process is the algorithm’s diffi-\nculty in producing balanced labels, which reflected\nmodels’ prior biases. We hope future work will\nlead to better understanding of the pros and cons\nof the approach.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank the anonymous\nreviewers for their constructive feedback.

Large language models are human-level\nprompt engineers. arXiv preprint arXiv:2211.01910.\n13496\nSupplemental Material\nA Implementation Details\nA.1 Writing the Seed Tasks\nOur method relies on a set of seed tasks to bootstrap the generation. The seed tasks are important for both\nencouraging the task diversity and demonstrating correct ways for solving the diverse tasks. For example,\nwith coding tasks to prompt the model, it has a larger chance to generate coding-related tasks; it’s also\nbetter to have coding output to guide the model in writing code for new tasks. So, the more diverse the\nseed tasks are, the more diverse and better quality the generated tasks will be.\nOur seed tasks were written when we initiated this project, and targeted for the diverse and interesting\nusages of LLMs. The tasks were written by the authors and our labmates at UWNLP, without explicit\nreference to existing datasets or specific testing tasks. We further categorized the tasks into classification\nand non-classification tasks, based on whether the task has a limited output label space. In total, there are\n25 classification tasks and 150 non-classification tasks. We release this data in our GitHub repository.11\nTo provide a sense of how much the model is generalizing beyond these seed tasks, we further quantify\nthe overlap between the instructions of these seed tasks and the instructions of our test sets, including both\nSUPER NI task instructions (§4.3) and the user-oriented instructions in our human evaluation(§4.4). We\ncompute ROUGE-L similarities between each seed instruction and its most similar instruction in the test\nset. The distribution of the ROUGE-L scores are plotted in Figure 8, with the average ROUGE-L similarity\nbetween the seed instructions and SUPER NI as 0.21, and the average ROUGE-L similarity between the\nseed instructions and user-oriented instructions as 0.34. We see a decent difference between the seed tasks\nand both test sets. There is exactly one identical seed instruction occurring in the user-oriented instruction\ntest set, which is “answer the following question” and the following questions are actually very different.\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 0 \n10 \n20 \n30 \n40 \n50 \nROUGE-L Similarity\nNumber of Instructions\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 0 \n5 \n10 \n15 \n20 \n25 \n30 \n35 \nROUGE-L Similarity\nNumber of Instructions\nFigure 8: Distribution of the ROUGE-L scores between seed instructions and their most similar instructions in\nSUPER NI (left) and the 252 user-oriented instructions (right).\nA.2 Querying the GPT3 API\nWe use different sets of hyperparameters when querying GPT3 API for different purposes. These\nhyperparameters are found to work well with the GPT3 model (“davinci” engine) and the other instruction-\ntuned GPT3 variants. We listed them in Table 4. OpenAI charges $0.02 per 1000 tokens for making\ncompletion request to the “davinci” engine as of December, 2022. The generation of our entire dataset\ncost around $600.\nA.3 Finetuning GPT3\nGPT3 SELF -INST and some of our baselines are finetuned from GPT3 model (“davinci” engine with 175B\nparameters). We conduct this finetuning via OpenAI’s finetuning API. 12 While the details of how the\nmodel is finetuned with this API are not currently available (e.g., which parameters are updated, or what\n11https://github.com/yizhongw/self-instruct/blob/main/human_eval/user_oriented_instructions.\njsonl\n12See the the details on OpenAI’s API.\n13497\nExperiments ↓ Temp.

We only set the “prompt_loss_weight” to 0 since we find this works better in our case, and\nevery finetuning experiment is trained for two epochs to avoid overfitting the training tasks. Finetuning is\ncharged based on the number of tokens in the training file. In our case, finetuning GPT3 SELF -INST from\nthe GPT3 model on the entire generated data cost $338.\nA.4 Prompting Templates for Data Generation\nSELF -INSTRUCT relies on a number of prompting templates in order to elicit the generation from language\nmodels. Here we provide our four templates for generating the instruction (Table 5), classifying whether\nan instruction represents a classification task or not (Table 6), generating non-classification instances with\nthe input-first approach (Table 7), and generating classification instances with the output-first approach\n(Table 8).\nCome up with a series of tasks:\nTask 1: {instruction for existing task 1}\nTask 2: {instruction for existing task 2}\nTask 3: {instruction for existing task 3}\nTask 4: {instruction for existing task 4}\nTask 5: {instruction for existing task 5}\nTask 6: {instruction for existing task 6}\nTask 7: {instruction for existing task 7}\nTask 8: {instruction for existing task 8}\nTask 9:\nTable 5: Prompt used for generating new instructions. 8 existing instructions are randomly sampled from the task\npool for in-context demonstration.

In the novel Bond looks into\nthe disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor\nNo. Bond travels to No’s Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect\nshells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The\ncharacter of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by\nSax Rohmer’s Fu Manchu stories.

This prompt is used for generating the instances for\nclassification tasks.\n13501\nB Human Evaluation Details for Following the User-oriented Instructions\nB.1 Human Evaluation Setup\nHere we provide more details for the human evaluation described in §4.4 for rating the models’ responses\nto the 252 user-oriented instructions. To ensure faithful and reliable evaluation, we asked two authors\nof these instructions (and of this paper) to judge model predictions. These two evaluators coordinated\nthe standards for the 4-level rating system before starting annotation and then each of them rated all\nthe instances independently. They were presented with the instruction, instance input, target output\n(as a reference), and model responses. Model responses are listed in random order, with all the model\ninformation anonymized. Figure 9 provides a screenshot of the annotation interface. The reported\nperformance in this paper is based on the results from one of the evaluators, and the trends from the other\nevaluator’s results are the same.\nFigure 9: Human evaluation in done using a Google sheet, with predictions from different models present in random\norder and the model information being anonymized. Our expert evaluators are required to read the instruction and\ninput, refer to the target, and then select the rating for the model’s response from A/B/C/D, corresponding to the 4\nlevels described in §4.4.\nB.2 Human Evaluation Agreement\nTo measure how reliable our human evaluation is, we calculate the inner-rater agreement between our two\nevaluators.\nWe first report Cohen’sκ, which is commonly used to measure inter-rater agreement for categorical\nitems. When calculating this, we treat the 4-level rating (A-D) as a categorical variable, leading to a κof\n0.58, which is a moderate agreement according to common practice.13 Furthermore, we also calculate the\nagreement of our evaluators on classifying acceptable responses ((A or B) vs. (C or D)), with a final κof\n0.75, indicating substantial agreement.\n13https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohen%27s_kappa\n13502\nWe also compute the Spearman correlation coefficient ρbetween the ratings of our two evaluators by\ntreating the rating as an ordinal variable (A>B>C>D). The final coefficient is ρ= 0.81, indicating a high\ncorrelation between the two evaluators.\nB.3 Example Predictions from GPT3 SELF -INST\nWe present a selection of user-oriented tasks, the corresponding GPT3 SELF -INST -produced responses and\nannotator ratings in Table 9. We see that even for responses rated as level C, the model demonstrates\nextensive steps in solving the task, even though its final output is incorrect.\n13503\nInstruction + Instance Input Target Response GPT3 SELF-INST Response Rating\nInstruction: Give students tips\non how to keep their nerves under\ncontrol during class presentations.\nEveryone gets a little nervous when speaking\nin front of a group.
