  "abstract": "This study presents an experimental seismic investigation of a 1000 kVA cast resin-type hybrid mold transformer through tri-axial shaking table tests. The input acceleration time histories were generated in accordance with the specifications recommended by the International Code Council Evaluation Services Acceptance Criteria ICC-ES AC156 code, with scaling factors in the range of 25–300%. The damage and the dynamic characteristics of the mold transformer were evaluated in terms of the fundamental frequency, damping ratio, acceleration time history responses, dynamic amplification factors, and relative displacement. The shaking table test results showed that the damage of the mold transformer was mainly governed by the severe slippage of the spacers and the loosening of the linked bolts between the bottom beam and the bed beam. In addition, the maximum relative displacement at the top beam in Y and Z-directions exceeded the boundary limit recommended by the Korean National Radio Research Agency. Moreover, the operational test of the specimen was performed based on the IEC 60076-11 Standard before and after the shaking table test series to ensure the operational capacity of the transformer.",
