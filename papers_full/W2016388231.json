  "abstract": "UV-Spectrophotometer response is a nonintrusive test used to determine the transformer integrity. Information about the health of the power transformer that can be use to plan cost, maintenance, relocation and operational criteria can be accurately interpreted using UV-Spectrophotometer. As UV scan can only show the pictorial information of the age of the oil hence it is not advantageous in all aspects. In the presented paper a Fuzzy logic method to determine the health assessment of the transformer oil introduced. The Fuzzy logic uses the UV/VIS spectroscopy absorbance values of the transformer oil which are in service at several locations. The Fuzzy logic method is designed so that the results of transformer oil can be examined quickly and automatically. The results obtained are interesting and accurate.",
