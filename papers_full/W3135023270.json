An exhaustive overview of the typical con-\nnection schemes utilized to interface the SST to the grid is\nprovided in [8] and [10].\nOne of the components essential for fulﬁlling the voltage\nconversion and the galvanic insulation of the SST is the\nmedium-frequency transformer (MFT). The MFT is a trans-\nformer operated with pulsewidth modulation (PWM) voltage\nwaveforms in the kilohertz range and the MV level. The\nmost common alternatives toconnect the MFT to the power\nelectronics are presented in [11]. The operating voltage level of\nthe MFTs typically results in similar insulation requirements\nas LFTs, to guarantee the same operational safety within the\nMV grid. The insulation level considered for the design of\nrecent MFTs is shown in Fig. 1 [12]–[14]; designs from\n[21]–[23] and [25] are operated with SiC semiconductor\ndevices. A positive trend is observed both in the number of\nMV prototypes realized in recent years and in the insulation\nlevel being considered. However, the declared insulation rating\ndoes not always align with the testing procedures prescribed\nby the international standards [26], [27], i.e., partial discharge\n(PD) and lightning impulse (LI) test. Therefore, the effective\ninsulation performance of these prototypes cannot be easily\ncompared.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License. Formore information, see https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n3588 IEEE JOURNAL OF EMERGING AND SELECTED TOPICS IN POWER ELECTRONICS, VOL. 10, NO. 4, AUGUST 2022\nDue to their much higher operating frequency, MFTs are\nsigniﬁcantly more compact than LFTs for the same transferred\npower. Nonetheless, since the required insulation rating is\nindependent of the speciﬁc transformer technology, the insu-\nlation thickness between the primary and secondary sides\nwould be equal for both the MFT and the LFT. This leads\nto the situation that the galvanic insulation system of an\nMFT occupies a much larger portion of the transformer’s\nvolume compared to an LFT, or in other words, the room\nfor additional design margins is drastically reduced for MFTs.\nTherefore, during the design stage, it is highly important to\nknow the electric ﬁeld stresses inside the insulation system\nto guarantee safe operation under all expected conditions\nwhile achieving the highest possible transformer performance,\ni.e., high efﬁciency and power density.\nDuring its lifetime, the MFT has to withstand the electric\nﬁeld stresses resulting from the PWM voltage applied by the\nconverter during normal operation [28], [29] and those coming\nfrom the very fast and short-term overvoltages, e.g., when\nan MV overhead line is hit by a lightning strike [20], [21].\nTherefore, the design is aimed to limit the maximum electric\nﬁeld below the dielectric strength of the insulating materials.\nThis limit can be characterized experimentally for the long-\nterm stability, e.g., by voltage endurance test and breakdown\ntest with impulse voltage [30]–[34]. The assessment of the\nstresses in the insulation is performed by evaluating the\nelectric ﬁeld distribution and the dielectric losses [35], [36],\nwhich both require to determine the voltage in the active\nparts.\nIn contrast to LFTs, MFTs are permanently exposed to fast\ntransients, both during normal operation, especially when they\nare operated with wide bandgap (WBG) devices, and in the\ncase of a lightning strike. Furthermore, the rise time of a PWM\nvoltage generated by WBG semiconductor devices can be\nsigniﬁcantly faster than an LI due to their superior switching\ncharacteristics compared to silicon-based devices [26], [37],\n[38]. These fast transients lead to a nonuniform voltage distrib-\nution along the windings caused by voltage propagation delays\nand/or the excitation of resonances between the distributed\ncapacitances and inductances of the winding. Nevertheless,\nthe design for continuous PWM operation and long-term stress\nis performed assuming a uniform distribution, as it is con-\nsidered in LFTs; hence, high-frequency effects are normally\nneglected [39]–[41]. However, if the design of an MFT does\nnot account for these effects, the high-frequency harmonic\nof the PWM can excite the internal resonances of the MFT\nwindings, resulting in repetitive ringing overvoltages during\nnormal operation. These overvoltages can intensify the electric\nﬁeld beyond the dielectric strength of the insulation, leading\nto the inception of PD and, therefore, reducing the lifetime of\nthe transformer [28], [30], [42], [43].\nTo quantify the frequency and the amplitude of these\nresonant overvoltages, a model of the MFT has to be set up.\nThe high-frequency effects of surge voltages on the voltage\ndistribution in the windings of transformers are historically\nknown [44], and they can be computed by solving 3-D full-\nMaxwell equations [45]. Network models based on fully\ncoupled multiconductor transmission lines (MTLs) are often\nadopted in the literature [46]–[52] due to the reduced compu-\ntational cost compared to [45].\nAn MFT with multiple windings is considered in [53],\nwhere a purely capacitive network model is used to compute\nthe voltage distribution of an LI. In the case of a PWM\nwaveform, this model could predict only the initial voltage\ndistribution in correspondence to the transition instant, but\nit cannot reproduce the subsequent oscillations due to the\ndischarge of the parasitic capacitances through the inductive\nnetwork [44]. The voltage distribution in the inductors of an\nSST is computed in [51]. However, the measurement of the\nvoltage distribution inside the winding is not performed, and\na detailed description of a suitable modeling procedure, espe-\ncially for litz wire, is not provided since windings consisting\nof foil and round conductors are analyzed.\nOne of the main challenges for the MTL method is the\nestimation of the frequency-dependent parameters, describing\nthe dissipative effects due to ohmic and core losses. These\nparameters need to be computed as accurately as possible\nsince they affect both the amplitude and the decay time of\nthe oscillating overvoltages. The dissipative phenomena in\nthe winding of a transformer are represented by a diagonal\nresistance matrix in [49]. This representation is effective in\nthe case of a standard two-winding transformer, but it is not\nsuitable for describing the dissipative effects in multiwind-\ning transformers [54], which are often used for multiport\nSSTs [11], [19], [54]. A full resistance matrix is introduced\nin [52], but the nondiagonal terms account only for eddy\ncurrent losses in the core since a standard two-winding LFT\nis considered. In [48], the skin effect is considered, whereas\nproximity losses are neglected. An efﬁcient method for foil and\nwire conductors is introduced in [50], but it does not apply\nto the litz of MFTs. Ohmic losses in litz wires are accurately\ncomputed by electromagnetic ﬁeld analysis by homogenization\nand complex magnetic permeability [55], [56].\nThe computation of the voltage distribution inside the wind-\nings of MFTs during continuous operation requires further\ninvestigations, and to the best of our knowledge, no experi-\nmental proof is provided in the literature. Therefore, this article\npresents a modeling procedure to include these effects in the\ndesign process of MFTs to prevent unexpected overvoltages\ndue to the unprecedented rise time of WBG devices. The out-\ncomes of this work are proposed to overcoming the challenges\nin increasing the insulation levels of SSTs operated with WBG\ntechnologies.\nIn Section II, the correlation between the rise time and\nthe harmonic content of a PWM waveform is recalled. The\nmethod of MTL is extended to cover litz wire conductors.\nA full frequency-dependent resistance matrix is computed\nby the ﬁnite element method (FEM) and homogenization\nof the litz bundle. The computation of the inductance and\ncapacitance matrices by FEM is discussed in the same section.\nIn Section III, the MFT used in the experimental setup and\nthe veriﬁcation of the model are presented. Results indicate\nsigniﬁcant overvoltages that have been measured at individual\nwinding turns. The effect of these overvoltages on the electric\nﬁeld in the interturn and interlayer insulation of the MFT is\ndiscussed. Finally, Section IV presents guidelines to mitigate\nCREMASCO et al.: VOLTAGE DISTRIBUTION IN THE WINDINGS OF MFTs OPERATED WITH WBG DEVICES 3589\nFig. 2.

H IGH -FREQUENCY MODEL OF THE MFT\nTo formulate the high-frequency model of the MFT, it is\nnecessary to identify the frequency spectrum of a PWM\nvoltage waveform, which is the input of the MTL model. The\nparameters of the MTL model are deﬁned and computed by\nthe FEM model of the MFT.\nA. Frequency Spectrum of a PWM Waveform\nThe ﬁrst step in the analysis of the high-frequency effects\noccurring in an MFT is the evaluation of the harmonic\nspectrum of the PWM voltage being applied. The bandwidth of\na nonstationary signal strongly depends on how fast its transi-\ntions occur. Usually, the fastest voltage transitions experienced\nby a conventional LFT are due to the occurrence of a lightning\nstrike, for which a rise time of 1.2 µs is considered [26]. As a\nconsequence, the design of the insulation of an LFT subject\nto an LI requires analyzing high-frequency phenomena, such\nas impulse propagation delays or the excitation of transformer\nresonances [49], [50]. These effects are normally neglected\nduring the design of the insulation of an MFT operated with\nPWM voltage waveforms [39]–[41]. Nevertheless, the rise\ntime of a PWM voltage generated by WBG semiconductor\ndevices can be even shorter than 1.2 µs [37], [38].\nIn the case of a symmetric PWM voltage with fundamental\nfrequency f\n1 and equal rise time ( tr) and fall time ( tf ),\nthe amplitude of each harmonic ˆ vh scaled by the PWM\namplitude ˆv is expressed analytically as [57]\nˆvh\nˆv = 2 sin(hπ/2)\nhπ/2\nsin(hπtr f1)\nhπtr f1\n, h = 1, 2, 3,… (1)\nIt is crucial to clarify that, for a given fundamental fre-\nquency, it is not the d v/dt but the rise time tr,w h i c h\nallows characterizing the high-frequency content of a PWM\nwaveform. In this respect, it is useful to describe the band-\nwidth of the spectrum by its corner frequency fc = 1/πtr;\nbeyond this frequency, a stronger decrease in the magnitude\nof the spectrum envelope occurs. This concept is exempliﬁed\nconsidering three PWM waveforms with equal fundamental\nfrequency f1 = 20 kHz, (namely, Wa,W b,a n dWc), as shown\nin Fig. 2. The normalized spectrum of Wa with ˆva = 1k V ,\ntr,a = 100 ns, and dv/dta = 20 kV/µs is taken as reference. The\nnormalized spectrum of Wb with equal rise timetr,b = tr,a but\nreduced amplitude ˆvb = 10 V overlaps the reference normal-\nized spectrum. Conversely, the spectrum of the waveform Wc\nwith dv/dtc = dv/dta but higher amplitude ˆvc = 10 kV has a\nfaster decay. This is caused by the lowerfc,c resulting from\nthe higher tr,c = 1 µs.\nFinally, from these considerations, it is possible to simplify\nthe measurements presented in Section III by using an LV\nsetup: during the tests performed at reduced voltage amplitude,\nthe normalized harmonic content of a reference MV PWM\nwaveform is preserved by keeping the samef1 and tr.\nB. Fully Coupled MTL Model of the MFT\nThe effects of the high-frequency harmonics on the voltage\ndistribution in the MFT during continuous operation are com-\nputed in the frequency domain by the MTL model described\nin [48], [49]. This approach is based on the discretization of the\nelectromagnetic ﬁeld equations by a fully coupled multicon-\nductor transmission line network, in which the mutual coupling\nbetween all the turns in the windings is considered [46],\n[47]. It is a reasonable assumption to model each turn as\nelectrically small [57] since the shortest wavelength in the\nharmonic spectrum of the PWM voltages being considered is\nsigniﬁcantly longer than the turn in the MFT. As a result,\nthe elementary entities constituting the network model of the\ntransformer are the single turns of the winding system. With\nthis representation, both the currents and the voltages are\nassumed uniform within their respective turn. To exemplify,\nFig. 3 represents the cross section and the corresponding\nnetwork model of a simpliﬁed MFT with 3 : 3 turns ratio\nbetween its primary (HV) and secondary (LV) windings. This\nmodel consists of the following:\n1) self and mutual resistances that are used to model the\nlosses in the MFT, i.e., the ohmic losses due to the skin\nand the proximity effects and the losses in the core [54];\n2) self and mutual inductances that represent the energy\nstored in the magnetic ﬁeld and the magnetic coupling\nbetween the turns;\n3) capacitors that describe the energy stored in the electric\nﬁeld in the interturn, interwinding, and turn-to-ground\ninsulation.\nAs shown in Fig. 3, the voltages applied to the windings\nof the MFT are represented by ideal voltage sources. This\napproximation is reasonable if the voltage waveforms applied\nto the MFT during operation are known. Otherwise, these\nvoltage sources should be substituted by an equivalent model\nof the converter to determine the waveforms resulting from\nthe coupling effect between the converter and the MFT. In\nthis work, the voltage waveforms applied to the terminals of\n3590 IEEE JOURNAL OF EMERGING AND SELECTED TOPICS IN POWER ELECTRONICS, VOL. 10, NO. 4, AUGUST 2022\nFig. 3. High-frequency model of a simpliﬁed 3 : 3 turns ratio MFT. The\nmutual inductances and the mutual resistances are omitted in the ﬁgure.\nthe MFT in the real application are assumed to be known.\nAs explained in Section III-C, these waveforms are experimen-\ntally measured and applied in the model to the MFT terminals\nby the corresponding voltage sources.\nThe MTL is described in the frequency domain; for each\nfrequency ω being evaluated, the vectors of the unknown\nvoltages v and currents i and the vector of the source voltages\nvg are considered. With reference to the exemplifying network\nin Fig. 3, they are deﬁned as\nv ∈ Rnv×1 =\n[v1 v2 v4 v5\n]T\n(2)\ni ∈ Rni×1 =\n[i1 i2 i3 i4 i5 i6\n]T\n(3)\nvg ∈ Rng×1 =\n[vHV,1 vHV,2 vLV,1 vLV,2\n]T\n. (4)\nThe equations of the MTL model are obtained by Kirch-\nhoff’s laws of voltages and currents solved in the frequency\ndomain by the mesh and the nodal analysis, respectively. The\nresulting system of equations is expressed in the matrix form\n[ KR + jωL\njωC −KT\n][v\ni\n]\n=\n[v0\ni0\n]\n. (5)\nThe matricesR ∈ Rni×ni , L ∈ Rni×ni ,a n dC ∈ Rnv×nv are the\nresistance, inductance, and capacitance matrices, respectively.\nThe nondiagonal terms of L, i.e., the mutual inductances,\ndescribe the magnetic coupling between the turns, whereas\nthe capacitive coupling is represented by both the diagonal\nand the nondiagonal terms ofC [58]. The computation ofR,\nL,a n dC is discussed in the next part of this section. The\nmatrix K ∈ R\nni×nv is the incidence matrix of the MTL model,\nand it depends on the winding turn conﬁguration. This matrix\nis dimensionless and block-diagonal. The vectors of the known\nvoltages and currentsv\n0 and i0, respectively, are deﬁned as\nv0 ∈ Rni×1 = Hvg (6)\ni0 ∈ Rnv ×1 = Tvg (7)\nwhere the matrices H ∈ Rni×ng and T ∈ Rnv×ng depend on\nthe connection of the input voltages to the MTL model. The\ndeﬁnition of the matricesK, H,a n dT for the MTL illustrated\nin Fig. 3 is expressed in (A.5), (A.6), and (A.7), respectively.\nIt is worth mentioning that (5)can be formulated also in the\ntime domain by other canonical forms. For example, the state-\nspace equations are derived in Appendix A, whereas other\nstandard representations are referred to [59].\nThe saturation of the core is not included in the model since\nthe MFT is normally designed to be operated in the linear\nregion of the B–H curve.\nThe effect of dielectric dissipation in the insulation is\nnot considered in the model since MV MFTs are normally\ndesigned with insulating materials characterized by low dielec-\ntric loss tangent tanδ [36], [41]. This design choice is aimed to\nprevent the thermal runaway of the MFT insulation stressed\nby MV PWM waveforms in the kilohertz range [36], [60].\nTherefore, as measured in [36], the dissipative phenomena\nin the MFT during normal load operation are dominated by\nelectromagnetic losses in the winding and in the core. This\napproximation leads to only minor overestimations of the volt-\nage amplitudes predicted by the MTL model, even if materials\nwith conservatively high dielectric losses are considered. This\nis conﬁrmed by the analysis in Appendix B, where the voltage\ndistribution in an MFT is predicted by including also the\neffects of the dielectric losses. Therefore, the conductance of\nthe insulation of the MFT can be reasonably neglected in the\nmodel.\nTo recapitulate, the voltage distribution inside the windings\nof the MFT is analyzed according to the steps illustrated in the\nﬂowchart in Fig. 4. These steps can be summarized as follows.\n1) The harmonic spectrum of the source voltages applied\nto the MFT is obtained by the Fourier transform.\n2) The MTL model of the MFT is deﬁned by computing\nits parameters:\na) the matrices K, H,a n dT;\nb) the matrices R and L for every frequencyω of the\nsource voltage spectrum;\nc) the matrix C.\n3) The harmonic spectrum of the turn voltagesv is obtained\nfrom (5).\n4) The waveform of each turn voltage is synthesized in\nthe time domain by the inverse Fourier transform of the\ncorresponding spectrum.\nC. RLC Parameters of the Model\nThe RLC parameters of the model are obtained by FEM,\nwhich is used to solve the magneto quasi-static (MQS) and\nthe electrostatic (ES) ﬁeld equations. The MQS ﬁeld equation\nis used to compute theRL parameters, whereas the ES ﬁeld\nequation is solved for obtaining the C parameters. The 3-D\nFEM analysis needs to be applied when no 2-D equivalent sim-\npliﬁcation is possible, e.g., when additional conductive or fer-\nromagnetic elements are located in the vicinity of the MFT,\nsuch as enclosures and electromagnetic shields. The impact\nof these structures on the RLC parameters of the MFT can\nbe signiﬁcant, so it has to be included in the FEM model.\nHowever, this is not the case for the MFT prototype considered\nin this work, where no enclosures or electromagnetic shields\nare present.\nCREMASCO et al.: VOLTAGE DISTRIBUTION IN THE WINDINGS OF MFTs OPERATED WITH WBG DEVICES 3591\nFig. 4. Flowchart of the modeling steps followed for the computation of the\nvoltage distribution in the MFT.\nSeveral methods are proposed in the literature to circumvent\ncomputationally expensive 3-D FEM simulations, by com-\nbining the results obtained by equivalent 2-D models. The\nsimpliﬁcation approach has to be chosen considering the\ngeometry of the windings and the core of the MFT. As\ndiscussed in Section III, an MFT prototype with E-core and\nrectangular winding is built in this work for measuring the\nvoltage distribution in the winding and verifying experimen-\ntally the MTL model. For this case, the “Double 2-D” method\ndescribed in [61] can be adopted for computing the MQS\nand ES ﬁeld equations by combining 2-D planar models. This\nmethod is veriﬁed in [61] only for the equivalent parameters\nof transformers without air gaps in the core, considering leak-\nage excitation, i.e., when equal and opposite magnetomotive\nforces (MMFs) are generatedby its windings. This method is\ncharacterized by possibly limited accuracy in the computation\nof the equivalentRL parameters during magnetizing excitation,\nespecially in the case of cores with large air gaps and,\ntherefore, high magnetizing currents. However, no large air\ngaps are present in the core of the MFT prototype considered\nin this work, so the magnetizing currents are limited, as well\nas their impact on the voltage distribution inside the winding.\nThe “Double 2-D” method presented in [61] and adopted\nin this work for computing theRLC parameters of the MTL\nmodel is recalled.\n1) Double 2-D Method:The MQS and the ES ﬁeld equa-\ntions used to compute the RLC parameters are solved by\nFEM using the “Double 2-D” technique presented in [61].\nThis method is based on the solution of two 2-D problems\n(Double 2-D) to analyze 3-D structures. The results of the\ntwo 2-D problems are obtained considering the cross sections\nFig. 5. (a) Top view of the MFT and crosssections considered in the “Double\n2-D” technique: (b) inside (section A-A’) and (c) outside (section B-B’) the\ncore window.\ninside and outside the core window of the MFT, as shown in\nFig. 5.\nAccording to this method, the matrixR is deﬁned as\nR = Rint + Rext (8)\nwhere Rint and Rext are the resistance matrices computed from\nthe FEM models of the cross sections internal and external to\nthe core, which are depicted in Fig. 5(b) and (c), respectively.\nThe depths considered for these models are deﬁned based on\nthe mean turn length of the coill\nm, which is equal to\nlm = 2(dlimb + wlimb) +\n+ π\n(\nwins,LV + wLV + wins,HV + wHV\n)\n(9)\nwhere the geometrical dimensions are indicated in Fig. 5. The\ndepth of the model representing the internal cross sectiondint\ncorresponds to the mean turn length of the coil inside the core\ndint = 2 dlimb. (10)\nThe depth of the model representing the external cross\nsection dext is deﬁned as\ndext = lm − dint. (11)\nThe procedure to compute the matricesL and C is analo-\ngous. As demonstrated in [61], this approach is less computa-\ntionally intensive than a full 3-D FEM model, but it does not\ncompromise the desired accuracy.\n2) RL Parameters: The matrices R and L are frequency-\ndependent due to the skin and the proximity effect in the\nlitz wire and the magnetic relaxation in the ferrite, which\nintroduces a phase lag between the magnetic ﬁeld intensity\nand the magnetic ﬂux density in the 1–10 MHz frequency\nrange [62]. This affects both the magnetic coupling in the\nwinding and the power dissipated in the core. Both matrices\nare computed at each angular frequencyω solving Maxwell’s\nequation for MQS ﬁelds\n∇·\n( 1\nμ∇A\n)\n+ jωσ A = J0 (12)\nwhere A is the magnetic vector potential, J0 is the applied\ncurrent density, andμ and σ are the magnetic permeability and\nelectric conductivity, respectively. The MQS ﬁeld equation and\n3592 IEEE JOURNAL OF EMERGING AND SELECTED TOPICS IN POWER ELECTRONICS, VOL. 10, NO. 4, AUGUST 2022\nthe matrices R and L are computed by the Double 2-D FEM\nmodeling approach described in Section II-C1. As described\nin [63], the elements of the resistance and inductance matrices\nare calculated by integrating the electromagnetic loss and the\nmagnetic ﬁeld energy densities computed by the FEM model,\nrespectively.\nThe frequency-dependent complex permeability of the core\nμ\nFe = μ′\nFe − jμ′′\nFe is used to include the dissipative effect of\nthe electromagnetic losses in the ferrite. This representation\nexcludes the necessity to model the eddy current in the core\nmaterial, which is assigned zero conductivity. The complex\npermeability is estimated in this work by using the character-\nistic curves available from the datasheet of the corresponding\nmaterial [62]. As discussed in [64], [65], a portion of the\nelectromagnetic losses described by the complex permeability\nis caused by eddy current, displacement current, and the\neffect of dimensional resonances in ferrite. These phenomena\nare affected by the size of the core. Therefore, the accurate\ncharacteristic curve of complex permeability has to be deﬁned,\nfor example, according to measurements on the core being\nused. As observed in the experimental veriﬁcation presented in\nSection III, using the characteristic curves from the datasheet\ncan lead to reasonably accurate voltage distributions, but the\nlimited validity of this approach is recognized.\nThe litz bundle is homogenized in the FEM model. Homog-\nenization allows computing skin and proximity losses in the\nlitz wire without representing explicitly the eddy currents in\neach individual strand [56]. This approach reduces drastically\nthe computational effort since the skin depth of the litz strands\ndoes not need to be discretized. The litz strands are assumed\nperfectly twisted, so the current sharing between them is equal.\nTherefore, a uniform current density is applied [55], [56],\n[66]. The equivalent conductivity and complex permeability\nof the homogenized litz are discussed in [56]. Alternative\nmethods to compute the equivalent properties representing\nohmic losses due to skin and proximity effect are described in\nthe literature [55], [56], [66]–[69]. The formulation proposed\nin [56] is chosen for its proven accuracy.\nFor each frequency, the entries of the full matrix R are\ncomputed as described in [54], and the resulting matrix R\nis a full-matrix whose nondiagonal terms are called mutual\nresistances. As demonstrated in [54], the mutual resistances\nin (5) provide a more generalized description of the proximity\nlosses in the model of the transformer.\n3) C Parameters:The matrix C is obtained by the Laplace\nequation for ES ﬁelds\n−∇ · (ε∇V ) = 0 (13)\nwhere ε is the permittivity. The insulation permittivity can\nbe reasonably assumed as constant in the frequency range of\ninterest [36]. In the model, the core is considered grounded,\nand the effect of displacement current and dielectric losses\nis not included. The ES ﬁeld equation and the matrix C\nare computed by the Double 2-D FEM modeling approach\ndescribed in Section II-C1. The elements of the capacitance\nmatrix are deﬁned according to [58]; as described in [63],\nthe capacitances are calcula ted by integrating the energy\nFig. 6. (a) MFT prototype . (b) Stratiﬁcation of the HV and LV windings.\n(c) Measurement points made accessible by soldering a 71µmw i r et ot h e\nwinding turns of the HV and LV windings.\ndensity stored in the electric ﬁeld, which is computed by the\nFEM model.\nIII. M EASUREMENTS AND VERIFICATION\nThe voltage distribution in the winding of the MFT and\nthe accuracy of the MTL model are analyzed in this Section.\nAn MFT prototype is built for experimental veriﬁcation. First,\na sweep frequency response analysis (SFRA) is performed\nto measure the transfer functions of the turn voltages and\nevaluate the accuracy of the model for individual frequencies.\nSeveral peaks in the voltage transfer functions are observed.\nThe origin of these overvoltages is investigated by measuring\nthe impedance of the HV and LV windings. Next, the MFT is\noperated with a symmetric PWM waveform to verify the MTL\nmodel. The occurrence of internal overvoltages is analyzed for\ndifferent rise times in the PWM waveform. Finally, the impact\nof these overvoltages on the electric ﬁeld stresses in the\ninsulation is discussed.\nA. MFT Prototype for the Experimental Setup\nThe MFT considered for this analysis is shown in Fig. 6(a).\nThe coil consists of an inner secondary winding (LV) and an\nouter primary winding (HV), radially stacked to the LV wind-\ning, as shown in Fig. 6(b). The turns ratio isN = 2:1 ,a n d\nthe design parameters relevant for the analysis are summarized\nin Table I . The HV winding is split into two equal layers,\ninsulated by two 0.5 mm Nomex foils.\nThe cross section of the 3C94 ferrite core allows operating\nthe MFT in the linear region of the B–H curve, at 20 kHz,\nfor voltages up to at least 1 kV. The effect of the magnetic\nrelaxation on the permeability of the core is taken into account\nby the frequency-dependent characteristic of the complex\npermeability of the material [62].\nThe voltage distribution inside both the HV and the LV\nwindings is monitored by measuring the voltage to ground\nof several winding turns. The notation adopted to indicate a\nturn consists of two capital letters and a number referring to\nthe winding and the position of the turn, respectively, e.g.,\nthe ﬁrst turn of the HV winding is indicated as HV1. The\ninternal voltage of the windingis made accessible by soldering\nCREMASCO et al.: VOLTAGE DISTRIBUTION IN THE WINDINGS OF MFTs OPERATED WITH WBG DEVICES 3593\nTABLE I\nDESIGN PARAMETERS OF THE MFT PROTOTYPE\nTABLE II\nPARASITIC CAPACITANCE BETWEEN THE MEASUREMENT WIRE AND A\nWINDING TURN ,C OMPARED WITH THE INTERTURN CAPACITANCES\n71 µm wires to the litz in correspondence to the turns of\ninterest, as shown in Fig. 6(c). This small size is chosen to\nlimit the parasitic capacitance C\np between the wire and the\nwinding turns in the vicinity: this capacitance has to be much\nsmaller than the interturn capacitances of the winding, so as\nnot to alter the frequency response of the MFT. To ensure\nthat the measurement is not compromised by these wires,\nthe capacitance C\np is compared with the interturn capacitance\nbetween two turns in the HV and LV windings Ct,HV and\nCt,LV, respectively. The interturn capacitance is computed by\nthe equation for parallel wires [57]\nC1,2 = 2πεl\ncosh−1\n(\ns2 −r2\n1 −r2\n2\n2r1r2\n) (14)\nwhere r1 and r2 are the radii of the wires being considered,\ns = r1 + r2 + dins is the distance between the axes of the\nwires, and dins is the thickness separating them. The interturn\ncapacitances Ct,HV and Ct,LV are computed considering l\nequal to the mean-turn length of the HV and LV windings,\nrespectively. The parasitic capacitanceCp is estimated by the\nsame equation, assuming that the measurement wire remains\nparallel and in contact to the turn for a lengthl = 20 mm.\nThis assumption is very conservative since the measurement\nwire is in contact with the winding for only a few millimeters,\nbut it allows to easily estimateC\np by (14).\nAs shown in Table II , Cp is approximately 1% of the\ninterturn capacitancesCt,LV and Ct,HV. Therefore, the presence\nof these additional measurement wires and the typical 10 pF\ninput capacitance of an oscilloscope probe does not affect\nthe capacitive coupling of the turns and the high-frequency\nresponse of the MFT.\nFig. 7.

Frequency Response of the Winding\nThe frequency response of the voltage in the winding turns\nis analyzed by a SFRA. The transfer functions Ti being\nanalyzed are deﬁned as the ratio between the ith turn-to-\nground voltagevi and the sinusoidal voltagevHV applied across\nthe HV winding, in correspondence to HV28 (the notation is\ndeﬁned in Section III-A)\nTi( f ) = vi( f )\nvHV\n(15)\nbeing the LV winding short-circuited and connected to the\ngrounded terminal of HV , in correspondence to HV1.\nThe measurements are performed by theAgilent/HP 4395A\nNetwork Analyzer. During this test, the LV winding is short-\ncircuited and connected to the grounded terminal of HV . The\nturns considered in this veriﬁcation are HV22, HV15, HV7,\nand LV7. As shown in Fig. 6(b), HV15 is positioned at the\ntop of the external layer in the HV winding, whereas HV22,\nHV7, and LV7 are located in the middle of their respective\nlayers. The magnitude and the phase of the transfer functions\nT\nHV22, THV15, THV7,a n dTLV7 are shown in Fig. 7.\n3594 IEEE JOURNAL OF EMERGING AND SELECTED TOPICS IN POWER ELECTRONICS, VOL. 10, NO. 4, AUGUST 2022\nAt lower frequencies, the magnitude|Ti| of the turns in the\nHV winding results from the purely inductive behavior of the\ntransformer, so it depends exclusively on the ﬂux linkage of the\nturn, and it is linear with the turn number, e.g., for HV7, it is\napproximately 7/28 = 0.25. At higher frequencies, the mag-\nnitude of the transfer functionsis frequency-dependent, and a\npeak in correspondence to f\ns = 3.6 MHz is measured. The\namplitude of the peak ranges between 2 .4a n d3.6f o ra l l\nthe turns positioned in the middle of each layer, i.e., HV22,\nHV7, and LV7, whereas it is 0.9 for HV15. Consequently, if a\ncertain voltage vHV with frequency fs is applied across the\nHV winding, the same voltage to ground appears at HV15,\nwhereas the voltage of HV22 andHV7 is ampliﬁed. Besides,\neven though the turn LV7 belongs to a grounded winding,\nits voltage to the ground would be raised to 2.4v\nHV at the\nsame frequency. As a further remark, at fs, the difference\nbetween the phases of the transfer functionsTHV22 and THV7\nis approximately 180◦. Consequently, the voltage difference\nbetween these two opposite turns can reach up to 6.8 times\nthe voltage applied externally, increasing the electric ﬁeld in\nthe insulation separating them. This scenario may not look\ncritical since the fundamental frequency at which the MFT\noperates is well belowf\ns. However, the harmonic content of a\nPWM voltage with a very short rise time may be large enough\nat this frequency to cause dangerous overvoltages inside the\nwinding. As shown in the same plots, the MTL model follows\nthis phenomenon with good agreement, for all the turns being\nconsidered, both for amplitudes and phases.\nTo investigate the origin of this voltage ampliﬁcation,\nthe short-circuit impedance of the MFT seen from the HV\nside ZHV,sc is measured by the Agilent/HP 4294A Precision\nImpedance Analyzer, to observe if any resonance is visible.\nThe measured impedance and the connection diagram illus-\ntrating the free terminals of the MFT at which the impedance\nis measured are shown in Fig. 8. The parallel resonance at\n3.2 MHz does not cause overvoltages, so it is out of the scope\nof this analysis. The ﬁrst series resonance frequency occurs\nin correspondence to fs; therefore, this resonance causes\nthe voltage ampliﬁcation observed in Fig. 6. To understand\nwhere the resonance occurs, the self-impedances of the HV\nwinding Z\nHV,0 and the LV windingZLV,0 are measured. The\nLV winding impedance ZLV,0 does not exhibit any series\nresonance near 3.6 MHz, whereas the ﬁrst series resonance\nof ZHV,0 coincides with fs. This indicates that the resonance\nobserved in the transfer functions is internal to the HV winding\nand that the frequency of this resonance is not sensitive to the\npresence of the LV winding. Besides, the voltage ampliﬁcation\nobserved in T\nLV7 is not caused by a resonance internal to the\nLV winding but is due to the electromagnetic coupling with\nthe HV winding.\nC. Voltage Distribution in the Winding During Continuous\nOperation\nThe voltage distribution in the MFT is analyzed with the\nLV winding short-circuited and connected to the grounded\nterminal of the HV winding, in correspondence to HV1. The\nvoltage vHV is generated by a bipolar half-bridge converter\nFig. 8. Measured short-circuit impedance of the MFT ZHV,sc and self-\nimpedance of the HV windingZHV,0 and the LV windingZLV,0: (a) magnitude\nand (b) phase. The connection diagram for each impedance is schematized in\nthe corresponding inset.\nequipped with GaN switches [70], providing a symmetric\nPWM waveform. The switch node of the converter is con-\nnected to HV28; therefore, the voltage waveforms applied\nacross the windings of the MFT are known. Since the ampli-\ntude of each voltage harmonic is distributed among the turns as\nin a voltage divider, the model for computing the turn voltages\ndoes not include the junction capacitance of the switches.\nIn the small-signal model of the converter connected to the\nMFT, these capacitances are located between the switch node\nand the ground; therefore, they do not inﬂuence the voltage\ndistribution inside the windings. To evaluate the impact of the\nPWM rise timet\nr on the voltage distribution, three waveforms\nare considered, namely, W1, W2, and W3, with the same\namplitude ˆv = ˆvHV = 10 V and the fundamental frequency\nf1 = 20 kHz but differenttr: tr,1 = 927 ns,tr,2 = 194 ns, and\ntr,3 = 54 ns. The fundamental frequencyf1 is chosen to be in\nthe rated frequency range of recent MV MFT prototypes [12],\n[18]–[20], [22], [23]. The rise timetr,1 is comparable to the one\nreached in [71] and is also representative of electronic circuits\nimplementing driver techniques that allow optimization of the\nswitching speed [72], [73]. The rise timestr,2 and tr,3 are in\nthe range normally reached by WBG devices [37], [38]. The\nfrequency spectra of the reference waveforms normalized by\nthe pulse amplitude ˆv are shown in Fig. 9: the waveforms\nwith shorter tr have a stronger harmonic content at higher\nfrequencies. As demonstrated in Section II-A and illustrated\nin Fig. 2, the frequency spectrum of a reference LV waveform\nnormalized by the pulse amplitude ˆv overlaps the normalized\nspectrum of a waveform with equal f\n1 and tr and higher\nCREMASCO et al.: VOLTAGE DISTRIBUTION IN THE WINDINGS OF MFTs OPERATED WITH WBG DEVICES 3595\nFig. 9.

Therefore, the following results can be scaled up\nto higher voltages, as long as the linearity of the magnetic\ncore is guaranteed, i.e., at least 1 kV. During the operation,\nthe voltage waveforms are measured with aLecroy HDO6034A\n12-bit oscilloscope and Lecroy PP017 passive probes with a\nbandwidth of 250 MHz and a 12 pF input capacitance.\nThe measured and computed voltages to the ground of\nHV28, HV22, HV15, and HV7 when the MFT is operated\nwith W3 are shown in Fig. 10(a)–(e). The voltage amplitudes\nmeasured inside the HV winding are normalized by ˆ v\nHV.\nThe measured voltage generated by the converter is shown\nin Fig. 10(a). The same waveform is considered in the MTL\nmodel to deﬁne the voltage applied externally to the MFT\nv\nHV = vHV,2, as shown in the exemplifying network in\nFig. 3, assuming the voltage of the other grounded terminals\nvHV,1 = vLV,1 = vLV,2 = 0 V. The voltagevHV,2 is applied in\nthe model in correspondence to HV28, and the commutation\ninstant is shown in Fig. 10(b), wheret\nr = 54 ns is indicated.\nAs expected from the SFRA, HV22 and HV7 exhibit an\noscillating overvoltage, whereas the voltage to the ground of\nHV15 does not indicate signiﬁcant overshoots, as shown in\nFig. 10(c)–(e). The MTL model reproduces the ringing effect\nobserved in these winding turns with a maximum discrepancy\nof 6.0% at the voltage peaks in the HV winding. The frequency\nof the computed oscillations, which coincide to f\ns,i s5 .6%\nhigher than the measured.\nThe voltage to the ground of LV7 is shown in Fig. 10(f); it\nis normalized by the voltage of LV during normal operation,\ni.e., when it is not short-circuited, ˆv\nLV = ˆvHV/N. The mea-\nsured overvoltage occurring in correspondence to the switch\ncommutations is approximately 0.74 times ˆvLV. During the\nnormal operation, this overvoltage would be superimposed to\nthe ideal waveform. As a result, the voltage to the ground\nof LV7 would exhibit a peak value equal to approximately\n1.5 times the voltage across LV . The MTL model reproduces\nthe observed ringing effect with a maximum discrepancy of\n19% in correspondence to the negative overshoot.\nThe effect of the overvoltages on the interturn insulation\nis investigated by analyzing the peak value of the voltage to\nFig. 10.

The proﬁles for both the\nHV and the LV windings are shown in Fig. 11. When the MFT\nis operated with W1, the overvoltages are not signiﬁcant, and\nthe voltage distribution in the winding is almost linear with the\nturn number. Conversely, with W2 and W3, the proﬁles exhibit\ntwo local maxima in correspondence to the turns HV22 and\nHV7 in the middle of each layer, caused by the ringing\novervoltages observed previously. These maxima increase the\nvoltage distributed along with the turns of the winding, e.g.,\nthe voltage distributed along the ﬁrst seven turns of HV raises\nfrom 0.3ˆv\nHV to 0.75 ˆvHV when tr decreases from tr,1 to tr,3.\nThis effect is neglected during design if a uniform voltage\ndistribution is assumed in the winding. This assumption is\nreasonable with the rise time of W1, which is representative\nof a scenario with conventional silicon switches. Nevertheless,\nin the case of WBG devices, it leads to an underestimation\nof the maximum interturn voltage, as well as the electric\nﬁeld stress in the interturn insulation during normal operation.\n3596 IEEE JOURNAL OF EMERGING AND SELECTED TOPICS IN POWER ELECTRONICS, VOL. 10, NO. 4, AUGUST 2022\nFig. 11.

Measured and computed interlayer voltagevlayer in correspondence\nto HV22 and HV7, considering (a) W1, (b) W2, and (c) W3.\nThe model predicts the overvoltage peak ˆv with acceptable\naccuracy for all the waveforms applied during the tests.\nThe effect of the ringing overvoltages on the interlayer insu-\nlation in HV is analyzed by considering the turns HV22 and\nHV7. Since these turns are positioned in front of each other,\ntheir voltage difference determines the interlayer voltagevlayer\nand the electric ﬁeld in the insulation in-between. The wave-\nforms of vlayer for the three reference waveforms are shown\nin Fig. 12. The overvoltage peak of vlayer results from the\nphase shift between the ringing overvoltages in HV22 and\nHV7, which is approximately 180\n◦. It increases for decreasing\ntr, and when the waveform W3 is considered,vlayer exceeds\nthe externally applied voltage vHV, as shown in Fig. 12(c).\nThis overvoltage intensiﬁes the electric ﬁeld between the\ntwo turns, increasing the electric ﬁeld stress in the interlayer\ninsulation. This effect has been predicted in Section III-B\nwhen comparing the transfer functions of these turns at f\ns.\nThe waveforms computed by the MTL model reproduce the\nmeasured ones in terms of frequency, amplitude, and phase:\nthe deviation of the peak amplitudes is always lower than 10%.\nIV . D\nESIGN GUIDELINES\nThe following guidelines recall possible strategies to mit-\nigate the internal overvoltages observed in Section III and\nprovide a simpliﬁed modeling approach for the veriﬁcation\nof routine designs.\nA. Prevention of Ringing Overvoltages During Continuous\nPWM Operation\nThe detrimental effects of the ringing overvoltages observed\nin Section III can be prevented by ensuring that the harmonic\ncontent of the PWM is low enough in correspondence to the\nseries resonance frequency of the MFT. In this way, the ampli-\nﬁcation of the harmonics in the turn voltage caused by the\nwinding resonance does not introduce critical overvoltages. In\nother words, enough margin must be guaranteed between the\ncorner frequency of the PWM spectrumf\nc and fs.\nRegarding the design of the power electronics, fc can be\nvaried modifying tr and, therefore, dv/dt of the switches:\n1) in the case of soft-switching operation, d v/dt can\nbe decreased by reducing the current being switched,\ne.g., by increasing the magnetizing inductance of the\nMFT or by adding a capacitor in parallel to every\nconverter switch;\n2) in the case of hard-switching operation, active gate\ncontrol techniques are proposed in [72] and [73].\nConcerning the MFT, the series resonance f\ns can be\nincreased by limiting the parasitic capacitance of the winding.\n1) The simplest way to reduce the parasitic capacitances\nis by increasing the insulation distances. Even though\nthis design choice can be easily implemented, it has the\ndrawback of limiting both the heat dissipation and the\ncompactness of the winding.\n2) A comparison between the standard winding stratiﬁca-\ntion used in the prototype shown in Fig. 6 and other\nconﬁgurations is performed in [74]. Although the para-\nsitic capacitance of the s-winding is approximately 10%\nlower than the standard winding, this conﬁguration is\nmore complex from the manufacturing perspective.\n3) An inductor featuring a chambered arrangement of the\nwinding turns is considered in [23]. It is characterized\nby approximately 40% lower parasitic capacitance than\na standard winding construction.\nThe last option seems an optimal solution since the manufac-\nturing complexity of a chambered winding is not signiﬁcantly\nhigher than the standard one.\nB. High-Frequency Model of the MFT for Routine Design\nThe main challenge for this design veriﬁcation remains the\nestimation of f\ns of the series resonance under investigation\nand, possibly, the ampliﬁcation factor of the PWM harmon-\nics causing ringing overvoltages. Although this task can be\nperformed very accurately by the MTL model, this method\nmight be too demanding for routine analyses since it requires\nthe calculation of large matrices for different frequencies in\nthe bandwidth of interest. Existing high-frequency models for\ntransformer design are normally developed focusing the atten-\ntion on the parallel resonances of the coil and their detrimental\neffects on current waveforms, both for the converter and the\npassive components [75], [76]. Therefore, a simpliﬁed model\nCREMASCO et al.: VOLTAGE DISTRIBUTION IN THE WINDINGS OF MFTs OPERATED WITH WBG DEVICES 3597\nFig. 13. (a) HV winding stratiﬁcati on. (b) Lumped element model of the\nHV winding with two layers. (c) Energy of the electric ﬁeld in the insulation\nof the HV winding.\nable to compute the series resonances in the winding of the\nMFT and to predict possible resonance overvoltages needs to\nbe formulated and to assess the electric ﬁeld stresses during\nroutine design.\nThe topology of the simpliﬁed network of the MFT proto-\ntype under exam is intended to model the resonance in the HV\nwinding, which originates from the interaction between the\ninductive terms in series and the capacitances in derivation,\nas illustrated in Fig. 13(a). The LV winding is not considered\nsince it does not inﬂuence the series resonance frequency,\nas observed in Fig. 8. To reduce the complexity of the model\nand the number of parameters to compute, the resonance is\nanalyzed only in correspondence to the turns in the middle\nof the two layers in the HV winding, HV22 and HV7, where\na maximum peak voltage to ground is observed, as shown\nin Fig. 11(a). Therefore, the winding turns are grouped as\nindicated by the dashed rectangles in Fig. 13(a), and each\ngroup is modeled as a lumped element in the simpliﬁed\nnetwork shown in Fig. 13(b).\nThe self-inductance of the four groups of turns and their\ncoupling factors are computed by the same “Double 2-D”\nmethod described in Section II-C, grouping the turns also in\nthe FEM model. The magnetic permeability of the core is\nextracted from the datasheet of the ferrite at 20 kHz [62], and\nthe wire is modeled as perfectly stranded.\nThe capacitances C\n1 and C2 represent the energy stored\nin the electric ﬁeld in the winding WE,tot: C2 is computed\nanalytically by the equation of the capacitance of a layer\nwinding [77], considering only the bottom half of the full\nwinding. The capacitance C\n1 is obtained by the energy dif-\nference between WE,tot and WE,2, as illustrated in Fig. 13(c),\nassuming V2 = V1/2\nWE,tot = 1\n2 CtotV 2\n1 (16)\nWE,2 = 1\n2 C2V 2\n2 (17)\nC1 = 2 WE,tot − WE,2\nV 2\n1\n(18)\nwhere the capacitanceCtot is computed from the same equation\nused forC2, considering the full height of the HV windinghw\nindicated in Fig.6(b).\nFig. 14.

To estimate\nthe correct ampliﬁcation of the PWM voltage harmonics in\ncorrespondence to the resonance, the resistance R of each\ngroup of turns is introduced and deﬁned considering the\nfrequency-dependent lossesPt caused by a currentI in a single\nturn [67], [69], [78]\nPt = Rt ˆI2\n2 =\n= Rt,dc\n[\nFr ˆI2 + n2\ns Gr\n(\nˆH 2\nm +\nˆI2\n4π2d2\na\n)]\n(19)\nRt,dc = 4\nσsπd2s\nlmkl\nns\n(20)\nwhere σs, ds,a n d ns denote the electrical conductivity,\nthe diameter, and the number of strands in the litz bundle,\nrespectively, da is the diameter of the noninsulated litz wire,\nlm is the mean-length of the turn, andkl is the ratio between\nthe length of a strand and the length of the litz wire, which\ndepends on the litz wire construction. The resistance coefﬁ-\ncients Gr and Fr are deﬁned according to [67] and [78] and\nrecalled in Appendix C. The average magnetic ﬁeld intensity\nin the HV winding ˆH\nm is computed as\nˆHm = 1\n2\nNt,HV ˆI\nhw\n(21)\nwith Nt,HV being the number of turns of the HV winding. The\nresistance of a turn Rt is obtained substituting (20) and (21)\nin (19) and dividing by ˆI2. Finally, the total resistanceR is\ncomputed multiplying Rt by the number of turns represented\n3598 IEEE JOURNAL OF EMERGING AND SELECTED TOPICS IN POWER ELECTRONICS, VOL. 10, NO. 4, AUGUST 2022\nby each lumped elementNt,l\nR = Nt,l Rt,dc\n[\nFr + n2\ns Gr\n(\nN2\nt,HV\n4h2w\n+ 1\n4π2d2a\n)]\n. (22)\nThe transfer functions THV22 and THV7 are shown in\nFig. 14(a) and (b), and the discrepancy between the frequency\nof the oscillations measured and computed by the simpliﬁed\nmodel is 20%. The normalized voltage waveforms of the\ncorresponding turn during operation with W3 are shown in\nFig. 14(c) and (d), and the overvoltage peaks computed in\nHV22 and HV7 are 15% and 16% lower than measurements,\nrespectively. Although this simpliﬁed model is less accurate\nthan the MTL, it has the advantage of an extremely less\ncomputationally intensive. On the other hand, the topology\nof the simpliﬁed network can be deﬁned only by knowing in\nadvance the critical resonances to reproduce, which are char-\nacteristic for every winding construction type, e.g., standard,\nchambered, or s-winding. In this respect, the MTL model can\nbe used as a reference for the development of the simpliﬁed\nmodels to use during routine design.\nV. C\nONCLUSION\nThis article highlights the implications of using WBG\ndevices on the electric stress in the insulation of MFTs by\nanalyzing the occurrence of overvoltages inside the windings\nresulting from the fast rise time in the PWM voltage. The\nvoltage distribution inside the winding of the transformer is\nmodeled by a multiconductor fully coupled transmission line\nmodel.\nThe model is extended by thefrequency-dependent induc-\ntance and resistance matrices. Both matrices are computed by\nthe FEM, modeling the litz wire with an equivalent complex\npermeability and electrical conductivity to include proximity\nand skin effect losses, respectively. The method is veriﬁed\nexperimentally by measuring the transfer functions of the\nvoltage to the ground of single turns by the SFRA and the\nvoltage to the ground during continuous operation with a\nconverter. The maximum deviation between the measured and\nthe computed ringing overvoltage peaks is 5.0% and 19.0%\nin the HV and LV winding turns, respectively.\nThe results indicate repetitive overvoltages in the interturn\ninsulation of both the HV and LV windings during normal\noperation. When the rise time of the PWM voltage is reduced\nto 54 ns, the overvoltage occurring inside the interlayer insu-\nlation of the HV winding reaches 1.6 times the amplitude of\nthe PWM voltage applied at the terminals of the transformer.\nThese overvoltages can increase the electric ﬁeld beyond the\ndielectric strength of the insulation, leading to the inception\nof PD and, therefore, reducing the lifetime of the transformer.\nTo prevent this scenario, several guidelines are proposed,\ntogether with a simpliﬁed modeling approach that can be\napplied for speeding up the design veriﬁcation process. The\noutcomes of this work can contribute to overcome the design\nchallenges in integrating WBG devices with MFTs and meet\nthe MV insulation requirements of SSTs interfacing the ac/dc\ndistribution grid of the future.\nFig. 15.

This\nappendix presents the evaluation of the sensitivity between the\npeak of the voltage waveforms computed by the MTL model\nof an MFT and the dielectric losses in the insulation.\nThe dissipative effect of dielectric losses can be included in\nthe MTL model by introducing in (5) a conductance matrixG\n[ KR + jωL\nG + jωC −K\nT\n][v\ni\n]\n=\n[v0\ni0\n]\n. (B.16)\nThe matrix G is frequency-dependent. It can be computed\nby electro-quasi-static ﬁeld (EQS) analyses, including the\nfrequency-dependent properties of the insulating materials.\nAlternatively, it can be approximated by the relationship\nbetween the insulation conductanceG, the capacitanceC,a n d\nthe dielectric loss factor of the insulation tanδ [30], [48]\nG = ωC tan δ. (B.17)\nTABLE III\nDIELECTRIC LOSS FACTOR OF MATERIALS TYPICALLY\nUSED IN MV MFTS\nFig. 16. Normalized peak voltage to ground ˆv of individual turns, showing\nthe impact of dielectric losses for different square waves.\nThe method to compute C is described in Section II,\nwhereas tan δ can be extracted from the datasheet of the\ninsulating material or by measurements [36].\nThe analysis is performed considering theRLC parameters\nof the MFT prototype described in Section III. The effect of\ndielectric losses is evaluated by analyzing the proﬁles of the\npeak values of the voltage to the ground ˆv of individual turns\nin the HV winding during continuous operation. The peak volt-\nages are compared when the MTL model is computed without\nincluding dielectric losses (tan δ = 0) and when dielectric\nlosses are considered up to a tanδ = 0.05. tanδ is assumed\nconstant in the whole frequency spectrum. tanδ covered by the\nsensitivity analysis is representative of the insulating materials\nnormally considered for MV MFTs, as discussed in [36] and\n[41] and recalled in Table III.\nThe voltage distribution in the HV winding is illustrated\nin Fig. 16; the turn numbering and voltage normalization\nare explained in Section III. The reference PWM voltage\nwaveforms W2 and W3 are considered since W1 does not\noriginate critical overvoltages. As observed, even a relatively\nhigh amount of dielectric losses cause only minor deviations in\nthe voltage distributions predicted by the model. The highest\n3600 IEEE JOURNAL OF EMERGING AND SELECTED TOPICS IN POWER ELECTRONICS, VOL. 10, NO. 4, AUGUST 2022\ndeviation is 3.0% when tanδ = 0.05 and waveform W3 is con-\nsidered (tr = 54 ns), whereas no signiﬁcant impact is observed\nfor waveform W2 (tr = 194 ns). It is worth remarking that\ntan δ = 0.05 is a quite high value for MFT insulation; hence,\nit is a conservative limit for this analysis. As shown in [36],\na thermal runaway in the MFT insulation can already occur\nin an insulating material with lower tanδ = 0.01 − 0.02 and\nstressed with PWM waveforms having rise times longer than\nW2. Therefore, the conductance matrix G representing the\ndielectric losses in the insulation can be reasonably neglected\nin (B.16). This assumption does not lead to unsafe design\nchoices, e.g., underdimensioning of the insulation, with the\nadvantage of reducing the parameters to determine in the MTL\nmodel, i.e., avoid frequency-dependent EQS ﬁeld analyses.\nA\nPPENDIX C\nRESISTANCE FACTORS FOR LITZ WIRE HOMOGENIZATION\nThe resistance factor Fr and Gr are used in the analytical\ncomputation of the ohmic losses in the litz wire, which is used\nin (19).
