The 3-stage conﬁguration, with a high\nfrequency transformer and 2 DC links, allows the electrical sepa-\nration of the LV and MV grids. This leads to the independence of\nthe two grids: any disturbance downstream and upstream can be\ncompensated and mitigated by the ST action, which is the case of\nthe unbalanced load condition of the LV grids. The unbalanced\ncurrents demanded by the loads could create unbalanced voltages\nat the LV side and also unbalanced currents at the MV side of\na traditional transformer. This paper presents the improvements\nachieved by ST implementation in terms of voltage and current\nbalancing: with a proper control of the ST, it provides balanced\nvoltage in the LV grid, demanding a balanced current from the\nMV grid. This feature increases the power quality in both grids\nand provides an improved service to the customers.\nIndex Terms—Voltage Unbalance - Current Unbalance - Smart\nTransformer - Solid State Transformer\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nST represents an enabling technology in the future distribu-\ntion grids. The ST purpose is not just a simple substitution\nof the traditional transformer in the LV and MV voltage\nsubstations but it aims also to upgrade the distribution grid\nproviding new services. The ST must prove to be efﬁcient\nand reliable like the traditional transformer and at the same\ntime ﬂexible to adapt to fast grid changes. The ST allows\nmore degrees of freedom for new control actions. Being\na 3 stage converter based on power electronics, it allows\nelectrical separation of the LV and MV grids [1]: they can act\nindependently and they are connected physically by means of\naverage active power exchange. This creates a ”ﬁltering effect”\nfor the disturbances affecting the two grids: any disturbance\n(ﬂicker, voltage sag, harmonics pollution) can be mitigated\nby the ST by means of a proper control and not transmitted\nto the other side. The traditional transformer does not have\nthis enabling characteristic and also this represents a limiting\nfactor for the grid improvement and hosting capabilities. At\nthis regard, the unbalanced voltage conditions of the LV grids\nare source of problems to the Distribution System Operators\n(DSOs). An analytical way to measure the voltage unbalance\nwith rms measurements is indicated in [2] and give as:\nVunbalance% =100∗max {|Vi,rms −Vavg|}\nVavg\nwith i = a, b, c (1)\nwhere Vunbalance% is the voltage unbalance index in per-\ncent, Vi,rms is the rms single-phase voltage, and Vavg is the\naverage among the three single-phase voltages. This method is\nalso recommended by [3] in the case of availability of voltage\nrms measurements and its values must be within the range\nof [0%-2%]. The unbalanced voltage conditions are coming\nfrom the presence of Distributed Generation (DG), new loads,\nlike Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs), or not balanced load\ndistribution in the grid. The unbalanced voltage problem raised\nby the integration of small single-phase Photovoltaic (PV)\npower plants in the LV grid is e.g. presented in [4]. Depending\non the installation distance of the PVs from the substation, the\nimpact on the voltage unbalance can vary signiﬁcantly. The\nscenario in [5] describes a case where the integration of BEVs\nhas already reached high level in the LV grid. Investigating the\nvoltage unbalance level during a long period, many violations\nof the limit imposed by the [3] have been found, mostly if the\nBEVs charging is not coordinated by any control algorithm.\nA detailed assessment on the impact of asymmetrical line\ngeometry and unbalanced load on the voltage proﬁles is\ndeveloped in [6]: it proposes a new load transposition method\nfor mitigating the voltage unbalance. As explained in [7]–\n[9], the unbalanced voltage conditions impacts heavily on\nthe motors (heating increase, torque pulsation, and reduction\nof lifespan). Wind turbines result be affected by unbalanced\nvoltage conditions as well. In [10] has been explained how\nthe Doubly Fed Induction Generators (DFIGs) are heavily\naffected from the voltage unbalances on the DC capacitors:\nthe presence of the inverse sequence creates a 2nd harmonic\noscillation on the DC link, impacting on the capacitor lifespan\nan reliability.\nThe traditional transformer cannot achieve improvement in\ncase of unbalanced grids: the ﬁxed winding ratio imposes\nunbalanced currents at the MV side if the LV side load\ndistribution is unbalanced too. Consequently, the voltages\nbecomes unbalanced due to the non-uniform voltage drop in\nthe grid. In this work the current unbalance is evaluated using\nthe following formulation:\nIunbalance% = 100∗|I−|\n|I+| (2)\nwhere Iunbalance% is the current unbalance index in per-\ncent, |I−|is the inverse sequence current magnitude, and |I+|\nis the direct sequence current magnitude. In normal operating\nconditions, this ratio must be within the range [0%-30%], as\nsuggested by [3].\nThis paper describes the improvements achieved with the\nST implementation in the LV/MV grid substations in terms of\nbalancing of voltage and current. Indeed the ST can provide\nbalanced voltage when the grid is unbalanced and demands\nbalanced current at the MV side. Section II depicts the control\nmethod adopted in this work; Section III describes brieﬂy\nthe Cigr ´e 12-bus feeder grid [11] used for simulations and\nprovides simulations using a traditional transformer; Section\nIV shows the simulation results when the ST has been imple-\nmented in the grid to demonstrate the improved performance.\nFinally, Section V is dedicated to the conclusions.\nII. ST C ONCEPT AND CONTROL\nThe major feature of the ST is a power electronics interface\nwith the grids [1]. The ST concept lies on the creation of a\nnew control point between the LV and MV grids, enabling\nnew possibilities in terms of grid optimization. The ST is\ncomposed of two grid connected inverters at the LV and MV\nsides and a Dual Active Bridge (DAB) converter, which is\nable to transform the voltage by means of an High Frequency\n(HF) transformer. The presence of the two DC link at the two\ndifferent DAB converter sides enables the electrical separation\nof the grids, as anticipated in the previous section. Fig. 1 shows\nthe ST concept by means of a single-line diagram:\nloadv\nMV\ngridv\nloadZ\nMV\nabcv\nLV\nabcv\nMV\ngridi\nHF\nDC\nAC DC\nAC\nLV\nDCv\nMV\nDCvDC\nAC DC\nAC\nFig. 1. ST 3-stage topology\nIn this paper an abc control method has been proposed\nfor synthesizing the balanced voltage at the LV side, and\ndemanding a balanced current at the MV side. The control\nis described in Fig. 2. The LV side controller is composed\nby a double loop: the inner one that imposes the voltage\nwaveform following a voltage reference, created by an external\none. Here a Proportional-Integral (PI) controller compensates\nthe error between the rms voltage on the LV grid side and\nthe reference value (i.e., here it is 230V rms). The output\nfrom the PI controller is multiplied by a sinusoidal waveform\npulsating at 50 Hz, compared with the grid voltage and sent\nResonant\nController\nPI\nController\nLV\nabcv\nRMS\nsin\nLV\ngridv\n*\nRMSgridv \n*\ngridv\nResonant\nController\nMV\nabcv\nsin\nMV\ngridv\nMV\ngridi\nMV\nDCV\n*MV\nDCVLPF\nPI\nController\n*MV\ngridi\n)a\n)b\nFig. 2. ST a) voltage and b) current controller\nto a Proportional-Resonant (PR) controller tuned at 50 Hz.\nThe output is the corrective action to be added to the feed-\nforwarded grid voltage in order to have the voltage waveform\nthat respects the voltage balancing requirements. The MV side\ncontroller works as a voltage-current loop: the ST measures\nthe DC voltage at the MV capacitor and compares it with the\nrated voltage value. Here, a PI controller minimizes the error\nand sends the reference value to the AC side controller, ﬁltered\nby a Low Pass Filter (LPF) in order to mitigate the quick set\npoint variations. The new reference value obtained represents\nthe reference current that must be applied at the MV side in\norder to keep constant the voltage in the MV DC link. This\nvalue is compared with the grid current and the error is sent\nto the resonant controller. As at the LV side, a voltage feed-\nforward signal is added to the compensated error. The voltage\nvalue calculated is the needed one in order to give the correct\ncurrent amount from the MV grid.\nIII. B ENCHMARK GRID\nThe benchmark grid used for showing the improvements\nachieved with the ST in the LV and MV grids is the LV\nCigr´e 12-bus feeder [11] as shown in the single-line diagram\nin Fig. 3.\nThe grid has been simulated in PSCAD/EMTC and the\nsimulation time window has been chosen of 100 seconds. This\ngrid is composed by unbalanced passive loads, modeled as\nconstant impedance; two photovoltaic power plants placed in\nnodes C and D; a ﬁxed speed wind turbine, placed in node\nE; and two Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs) placed\nin nodes A and B. This grid represents a good benchmark\nfor testing the unbalanced conditions of LV grid: the load is\nheavily unbalanced as it can be noticed by the current rms\nproﬁles in Fig. 4. The current unbalance leads to an unbalanced\nvoltage drop, as shown in Fig. 5. The unbalanced conditions\nfrom the LV grid are transferred to the MV grid. Fig. 6 shows\nthe unbalanced conditions in a time framework of 100 ms.\nThe unbalance trends are more evident if evaluated taking\ninto account equations (1) for the LV grid voltages and (2) for\nthe MV grid currents. Fig. 7 shows the characteristic of the\naforementioned voltage index: although the values are still in\nthe suggested range, they are high considering the small load\n20 kV\n0.4 kV\nSA = 1 kVA\nSB = 2 kVA\nSC = 2.7 kVA\npf = 0.85\nPV\n4 kW\nSA = 4.8 kVA\nSB = 6.4 kVA\nSC = 8 kVA\npf = 0.85\nWT\n5.5 kW\nSA = 4.8 kVA\nSB = 6.4 kVA\nSC = 8 kVA\npf = 0.85\nBESS\nSmax = 35 kVA\npf = 0.85\nPV\n3 kW\nSA = 1.6 kVA\nSB = 3.2 kVA\nSC = 4 kVA\npf = 0.85\nBESS\nSmax = 25 kVA\npf = 0.85\nSC = 2.7 kVA\npf = 0.85\nC B\nD E\nA\nMV\nLV\nFig. 3.

LV line currents simulated in the Cigr ´e model with traditional\ntransformer: Phase A (blue line), Phase B (green line), Phase C (red line)\ndemanded in the studied grid. If the load tends to increase\nproportionally, the limit of 2% can easily be exceeded. Fig. 8\ndescribes the MV current ratio values which are referred in\neq.(2): the limit of 30% is exceeded for one third of the time,\ndeteriorating the power quality in the MV grid.\nIn respect to the grid described above, to study the per-\nformance of the ST, several hypothesis have been done for\nthe DG and the BESSs: 1) the photovoltaics are working\nwith a power factor equal to unity and without any droop\ncontrol; 2) a V-Q droop control has been implemented in\nthe BESSs; 3) the active power proﬁles of the BESSs have\nbeen set independently from the grid state and they do not\nchange varying the grid parameters. The DG and BESSs power\nproﬁles are shown in Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 respectively. Fig. 9\ndepicts the instantaneous active power of the photovoltaic\nplants and wind turbine. The DG power plants are small in\nsize, so the contribution in terms of active power results be\nmarginal. A greater power contribution is given by the BESSs,\nwhere Fig. 10 shows their active and reactive instantaneous\npower proﬁles.\nThe batteries are performing a charging-discharging power\nFig. 5.

DG active power using a traditional transformer: Photovoltaic in node\nC (blue line), Photovoltaic in node D (green line), Wind Turbine in node E\n(red line)\nFig. 10. Active and reactive power of BESSs in nodes A and B using a\ntraditional transformer\nvalue, depends on the active power set points: it must be in\nagreement with the batteries apparent power size. As it can be\nnoticed in Fig. 10, the reactive power is not always available:\nworking at maximum power as a load (within the range [ 55 s-\n65 s]), the BESS B limits the reactive power injection to zero.\nIt results in a further reduction of the voltage magnitude in\nall of the phases. The active and reactive instantaneous power\nmeasured at the transformer level are represented in Fig. 11.\nThe reactive power injected by the transformer is small, due\nto the V-Q droop controller operation in the grid.\nFig. 11. Active and reactive power provided to the LV grid using a traditional\ntransformer\nIV. S IMULATION RESULTS OF ST\nThis Section describes the simulation results obtained by the\nST implementation in the LV/MV substation and applying the\ncontrol as described in Section II. With respect to the case of\nthe traditional transformer, it compared the same load demand\nfor a fair comparison and the same active power production\nby the DG and BESSs. The reactive power injection of BESSs\nchanges accordingly with the V-Q droop controller operation,\nas depicted in Fig. 12. In this case, less reactive power has been\ninjected with respect to the traditional transformer case. This is\ndue to the improved ST voltage control, that ﬁxes the voltage at\nsubstation level to 230 V . Fig. 12 shows how the BESS placed\nin node A injects only a limited amount of reactive power in\nthe time window considered. Instead, the BESS taking place in\nnode B, results be limited in the reactive power injection when\nthe BESS maximum capability is reached. The lower request\nof reactive power at BESS level must be compensated by the\nST. Indeed Fig. 13 shows how the reactive power injected in\nthe grid at substation level is increased on average. Instead,\nthe active power supplied by ST is practically unchanged.\nFig. 12. Active and reactive power of BESSs in nodes A and B using a ST\nFig. 13. Active and reactive power provided to the LV grid using a ST\nUnder the aforementioned considerations, the controller\nperforms the control action for balancing the ST voltages: it\ncan be noticed in Fig. 14 how the voltage is perfectly balanced\nfor the whole simulation time, independently of the active and\nreactive power load request. Indeed, the demand of current at\nST level is still unbalanced, as demonstrated in Fig. 15, but\nthe voltage controller forces the ST to synthesize balanced\nvoltages and thus the voltage unbalance index results to be near\nzero. It is worth to highlight the current proﬁles changing with\nrespect to the traditional transformer case due to the different\nreactive power injection proﬁle of the ST.\nApplying the control proposed in Section II, the ST achieves\nbalancing improvements also at the MV side. The proposed\nFig. 14. LV line-to-ground voltages using a ST: Phase A (blue line), Phase\nB (green line), Phase C (red line)\nFig. 15. LV line currents using a ST: Phase A (blue line), Phase B (green\nline), Phase C (red line)\ncontroller shown in Fig. 2 enables the compensation of the un-\nbalanced currents requested by the loads. The current proﬁles,\nas depicted in Fig. 16, are now perfectly balanced.\nFig. 16. MV line currents using a ST: Phase A (blue line), Phase B (green\nline), Phase C (red line)\nThis effect is better demonstrated considering the current\nunbalance index in Fig. 17: by using the ST the current\nunbalance ratio in MV grid is always below 4% for the whole\nconsidered period, instead of the peak over 60% achieved in\nthe traditional transformer case as shown in Fig. 8.\nV. C ONCLUSION\nThis paper has studied one of the main services that the ST\ncan provide to the distribution grid which is current and volt-\nage balancing. The ST implemented in the LV/MV substations\nhas ﬁltering capabilities in respect to these grid disturbances. If\nan unbalanced condition is present in the LV grid, the ST can\nFig. 17. Current Unbalance Ratio as given in eq.(2) using a ST\nstill provide perfectly balanced voltage proﬁles and demand\nbalanced currents to the MV grid. Compared to the traditional\ntransformer, the ST has demonstrated to increase signiﬁcantly\nthe power quality, both in LV and MV grids which increases\nthe service quality to the customers.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe research leading to these results has received funding\nfrom the European Research Council under the European\nUnions Seventh Framework Programme (FP/2007-2013) /\nERC Grant Agreement n.
