Though there is no \nconsensus about definition for frequent \nusers, thresholds in the literature range from \ntwo to more than 10 ED visits per year,\n1 2 while \nthe most common one is more than four ED \nvisits per year.\n1 2  Frequent users represent a \nsmall proportion of ED users but account \nfor a large number of visits.\n3–5 They often \ndisplay complex characteristics such as low \nsocioeconomic status combined with phys-\nical and mental health issues.\n6 As such, their \nED use is considered suboptimal,7 as the best \nstrategy would be to identify those patients at \nan earlier stage in their health problem trajec-\ntory, in order to treat them more efficiently.\n8 \nFurthermore, frequent users’ visits may lead \nto overcrowding in EDs and decreased quality \nof care.\n2 Identifying factors that best describe \nthose users and predict their ED use is there-\nfore an essential task to improve ED care \nas well as frequent users’ health problems. \nAdequate statistical tools are needed to that \nend. Although they are numerous, no liter -\nature review has been published yet about \nstatistical tools used for analysing ED frequent \nusers. Therefore, the aim of our study was to \ndraw up a list of statistical tools used in iden-\ntifying variables associated with frequent use \nor predicting the risk of becoming a frequent \nuser.\nMeth\nO\nds\nIn order to list the statistical tools used in \ndescribing variables associated with and \nprediction of frequent ED use, we conducted a \nscoping review. We followed the 5-stage meth-\nodology of Arksey and O'Malley\n9 adapted by \nLevac et al.10 The methodological framework \nof a scoping review allows ‘mapping rapidly \nthe key concepts underpinning a research \narea and the main sources and types of \nstrengths and limitations of this study\n ► First overview of statistical tools used in frequent \nusers analysis.\n ► Follows a well-defined methodological framework in \nan extensive body of literature.\n ► Quality assessment is not performed in a scoping \nreview.\n ► Studies in other languages than English or French \nmight have been missed.\nProtected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies.\n . by guest on November 5, 2025 http://bmjopen.bmj.com/Downloaded from 24 May 2019. 10.1136/bmjopen-2018-027750 on BMJ Open: first published as \n2\nChiu Y, et al.

Of \nthose, 32 were duplicates and 4344 were excluded by an \ninvestigator (YC) after reading the title and the abstract. \nAt this stage, studies were discarded if it was explicit \nfrom the title and the abstract that they were unfit for \nthe scoping review (for instance studies about frequent \nuse of inpatient services, systematic reviews, etc). In case \nof uncertainty, studies were kept for complete reading. \nThen, YC and FRH or ID independently evaluated the \nremaining 158 full text articles, of which 109 matched the \nabove criteria. A third evaluator was consulted in case of \ndiscrepancy. Reasons for exclusion were: not in French \nor English (1), duplicate (3), systematic review (4), no \ninferential statistics (5), no explicit definition of frequent \nusers (5), focus not on ED (14), no description or predic-\ntion of frequent users (17). A reference search among \nthe references of the 109 included articles yielded five \nrelevant articles. Thus, 114 articles were included in this \nstudy, of which YC, ID and MB examined the full texts.\ns\ntage 4: Charting the data\nYC, MB and ID independently extracted the corre-\nsponding data. Reported characteristics were the \nfirst (two) author(s), the publication year, the study \nlocation, the population, the frequent users’ definition, \nthe objectives, the sample size and the statistical tools \nused concerning the research question.\ns\ntage 5: Collating, summarising and reporting the results\nThe results are reported via a content analysis.13\nPatient and public involvement\nPatients or public were not involved in this study.\nr\nesults\nThe studies’ main characteristics are presented in table\n \n1. \nOut of 114 studies, 65 were conducted in the USA, 17 in \nCanada and 8 in Australia (figure\n \n2).

BMJ Open 2019;9:e027750. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2018-027750\nOpen access  \ndIsCussIOn\nThe most \nexploited statistical tools arguably came from \nregression analysis. This may be because regression is \nwell established in medical statistics or also because it \nis the most natural tool when trying to find significant \nvariables to explain a dependent variable (in this case, \nto be a frequent user). Moreover, it allows predicting \neasily the risk of a new user becoming a frequent user, \ndepending on its covariates. Other tools from hypothesis \ntesting or machine learning also proved to be popular, \nalthough to a much lesser extent. Combining these statis-\ntical techniques may help in discovering significant and \ncomplementary patterns, compared with using tools from \none class only. In our scoping review, two studies mixed \nstatistical tools from regression, hypothesis testing and \nmachine learning.\n31 36 In those studies, the author eval-\nuated various performance criteria. While logistic regres-\nsion performed well, other techniques such as random \nforests or LASSO regression were also competitive. \nBesides the fact that logistic regression can display modest \nperformances,\n128 random forests and LASSO regression \ncan complete logistic regression. The first technique can \nbe used to assess the importance of each independent \nvariable in the model, while the second technique can \nbe useful for automatic selection of features. Likewise, \nusing a variety of statistical tools can help complete or \nconfirm results obtained with established methodologies. \nDifferent tools from one class can also be mixed in order \nto achieve different stages of the analysis (for instance, \ndifferent types of regression\n82).\nThe analysis of frequent ED users could benefit from \nusing more machine learning techniques. Those were \nfound to be not as common as regression or hypothesis \ntesting, although they are especially appropriate when \ndealing with classification, prediction or big data. Tools \nsuch as support vector machines (which were used by \ntwo studies in this scoping review\n31 36 ), artificial neural \nnetworks or Bayesian networks are common classifiers \nand predictors in the artificial intelligence community.\n129 \nThey are popular for instance in cancer diagnostic and \nprognosis, which strongly rely on classification and \nprediction.\n130–132 In particular, support vector machines, \ndecision trees or self-organising maps can deal with \nbinary outcomes, which is usually the case for frequent \nuse outcomes. They usually require large datasets in order \nto overcome overfitting, but this is becoming less and less \nof an issue in health sciences.\n133 Nevertheless, machine \nlearning tools often use a black box approach as there \nare many intermediary steps leading to the final solution. \nWhile each step usually consists of simple arithmetic oper-\nations, their multiple interactions can be more difficult to \ninterpret. In spite of this opacity, they still display good \nperformances in classifying and predicting. In some cases, \nthey may be more accurate than the widely used logistic \nregression.\n134 Those methods would thus turn out to be \nless useful in data exploration.135 Machine learning tools \nare getting popular in other fields in health sciences, such \nas critical care,\n136 cardiology137 or emergency medicine.138 \nThe authors state that their fields would benefit from this \ngrowing popularity, though results need to be analysed \nand interpreted in collaboration with clinicians.\nOther tools exist that may also be suitable for describing \nthe associated variables or the prediction of frequent ED \nusers but were not reported in the literature. Among \nthose, principal component analysis (PCA) is a dimen-\nsional reduction and visualisation technique, sometimes \nused with cluster or discriminant analysis.\n139 Based on all \nthe original explanatory variables, PCA constructs new \nones by summing and weighing them differently. More \nweight is given to relevant variables so that those latter \nbecome dominant in the new constructions while still \nincluding all variables. For instance, Burgel et al\n140 built \nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease clinical pheno-\ntypes by constructing new relevant variables with PCA and \nby grouping similar subjects in this new space with cluster \nanalysis.\n140 Moreover, PCA has already been used for the \nconstruction of questionnaires and diagnosis tools in a \nmedical context,\n141 142 both of which can prove useful in \nthe identification of frequent users.\nAs mentioned, regression techniques were common in \nthe selected studies. Yet, quantile regression (QR) 143 was \nnot mentioned. QR is a generalisation of mean regres-\nsion in the sense that its focus is not only the mean of the \ndependent variable distribution (such as in classical linear \nregression) but any quantile of it. QR thus represents an \nalternative to define frequent users by the high quantiles \nof ED visit distribution (eg, the 90th quantile). Eight \nstudies\n25 27 46 48 51 54 62 121 defined frequent users with quan-\ntiles, but they did not use QR. QR would allow for finer \ninvestigations in the different quantiles of ED users in \nrelationship to the explanatory variables. For instance, \nthe association between age and the number of ED visits \nmay be significantly different across the 10th (low users) \nand 90th (frequent users) quantiles. Such a heteroge-\nneous association would be uncovered by QR, while \nusually unseen with a classical mean regression. Ding et \nal\n144 used QR to characterise waiting room and treatment \ntimes in EDs. 144 They explored the lowest, median and \nhighest of those times and highlighted predictors that \nwere significant only in particular quantiles. Usually, QR \nrequires a continuous dependent variable as opposed to a \nlogistic regression, though it is possible to combine these \ntwo regressions.\n145 Furthermore, defining frequent users \nby quantiles would allow for better comparison between \nstudies as there is no common definition for frequent \nusers.\ns\ntrengths and limitations\nTo the best of our knowledge, this scoping review is the \nfirst to list statistical tools that are used in the identifica-\ntion of variables associated with frequent ED use and the \nprediction of frequent users. Besides, it was conducted \nfollowing a well-defined methodological framework. \nThe search strategies were designed with an information \nspecialist in three different databases. Two independent \nevaluators selected the articles and extracted the data \nProtected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies.\n . by guest on November 5, 2025 http://bmjopen.bmj.com/Downloaded from 24 May 2019. 10.1136/bmjopen-2018-027750 on BMJ Open: first published as \n13\nChiu Y, et al.

However, this should \nnot alter the results, since the aim was to list which statis-\ntical tools have been applied in the literature. Moreover, \nthe majority of articles were in English which may intro-\nduce a selection bias (for instance, one excluded article \nwas in Spanish). More than half of the reviewed studies \nwere indeed conducted in the USA, making the results \ndifficult to compare to other countries.\nC\nO\nn\nC\nlus\nIO\nns\nFrequent ED users represent a complex issue, and their \nanalysis require adequate statistical tools. In this context, \nthis scoping review shows that some tools are well estab-\nlished, such as logistic regression and χ\n2 test, while others \nsuch as support vector machines are less so, though they \nwould deserve to get more attention. It also outlines some \nresearch opportunities with other tools not yet explored.\nAcknowledgements W e would like to thank information specialist Josée Toulouse \nfor her help in defining the search strategies and Tina Wey (PhD) for revising the \ntext.\nContributors\n YC and CH designed the stud\ny with FR-H, ID and AV.
