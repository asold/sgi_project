Drivenbyapplicationrequirementsandusingwell-understood\ntheoretical results, we describe a novel methodology and a tool for modular\nontology design. We support the user in thesafe use of imported symbols\na n di nt h eeconomic import of the relevant part of the imported ontology.\nBoth features are supported in a well-understood way: safety guarantees\nthat the semantics of imported concepts is not changed, and economic im-\nport guarantees that no diﬀerence can be observed between importing the\nwhole ontology and importing the relevant part.\n1 Motivation\nOntology design and maintenance require an expertise in both the domain of ap-\nplication and the ontology language. Realistic ontologies typically model diﬀerent\naspects of an application domain at various levels of granularity; prominent ex-\namples are the National Cancer Institute Ontology (NCI)1 [1], which describes\ndiseases, drugs, proteins, etc., and GALEN2, which represents knowledge mainly\nabout the human anatomy, but also about other domains such as drugs.\nOntologies such as NCI and GALEN are used in bio-medical applications as\nreference ontologies, i.e., ontology developers reuse these ontologies and customise\nthem for their speciﬁc needs. For example, ontology designers use concepts3 from\nNCI or GALEN and reﬁne them (e.g., add n ew sub-concepts), generalise them\n(e.g., add new super-concepts), or refer to them when expressing a property of\nsome other concept (e.g., deﬁne the conceptPolyarticular\n JRA by referring to the\nconcept Joint from GALEN).\nOne of such use cases is the development within the Health-e-Child project of\nan ontology, called JRAO, to describe a kind of arthritis called JRA (Juvenile\n1 Online browser:http://nciterms.nci.nih.gov/NCIBrowser/Dictionary.do,l a t e s t\nversion: ftp://ftp1.nci.nih.gov/pub/cacore/EVS/NCI\n Thesaurus\n2 http://www.co-ode.org/galen\n3 We use the Description Logic terms “concept” and “role” instead of the OWL terms\n“class” and “property”.\nS.

Constructing the ontology JRAO reusing fragments of GALEN and NCI\nRheumatoid Arthritis).4 Following the ILAR5, JRAO describes the kinds of JRA.\nThose are distinguished by several factors such as the joints aﬀected or the oc-\ncurrence of fever, and each type of JRA requires a diﬀerent treatment. GALEN\nand NCI contain information that is relevant to JRA, such as detailed descrip-\ntions of the human joints as well as diseases and their symptoms. Figure 1 gives\na fragment of NCI that deﬁnes JRA. It also shows our reuse scenario, where\nC1,...,C 7 refer to the kinds of JRA to be deﬁned in JRAO.\nThe JRAO developers want to reuse knowledge from NCI and GALEN for\nthree reasons: (a) they want to save time through reusing existing ontologies\nrather than writing their own; (b) they value knowledge that is commonly ac-\ncepted by the community and used in similar applications; (c) they are not\nexperts in all areas covered by NCI and GALEN.\nC u r r e n t l y ,G A L E N ,N C I ,a n dJ R A Oa r ew r i t t e ni nO W LD L[ 2 ] ,a n dt h u st h e y\ncome with a logic-based semantics, which allows for powerful reasoning services\nfor classiﬁcation and consistency checking. Thus, ontology reuse should take\ninto account the semantics and, more precisely, should provide the following two\nguarantees. First, when reusing knowledge from NCI and GALEN, the developers\nof JRAO do not want to change the original meaning of the reused concepts.\nFor example, due to (b) and (c) above, if it follows from the union of JRAO\nand NCI that JRA is a genetic disorder, then it also follows from NCI alone.\nSecond, only small parts of large ontologies like NCI and GALEN are relevant\n4 See http://www.health-e-child.org. This project aims at creating a repository of\nontologies that can be used by clinicians in various applications.\n5 Int. League of Associations for Rheumatology http://www.ilarportal.org/\nSafe and Economic Re-Use of Ontologies 187\nto the sub-types of JRA. For eﬃciency and succinctness, the JRAO developers\nwant to import only those axioms from NCI and GALEN that are relevant for\nJRAO. By importing only fragments of NCI and GALEN, one should not lose\nimportant information; for example, if it follows from the union of the JRAO\nand NCI that JRA is a genetic disorder, then this also follows from the union of\nJRAO and the chosen fragment of NCI.\nOur scenario has two main points in common with other ontology design\nscenarios: the ontology developer wants to reuse knowledge without damaging\nit, and also to import only the relevant parts of an existing ontology. To support\nthese scenarios whilst providing the two above guarantees, a logic-based approach\nto reuse is required. Current tools that support reuse, however, do not implement\na logic-based solution and thus do not provide the above guarantees—and neither\ndo existing guidelines and “best practices” for ontology design.\nIn this paper, we propose a methodology for ontology design in scenarios\ninvolving reuse which is based on a well-understood logic-based framework [3].\nWe describe a tool that implements this methodology and report on experiments.\n2 Preliminaries on Modularity\nBased on the application scenario in Section 1, we deﬁne the notions of a con-\nservative extension, safety,a n dmodule [4, 3]. For simplicity of the presentation,\nwe restrict ourselves to the description logicSHIQ,w h i c hc o v e r sm o s to fO W L\nDL [2]. Therefore the ontologies, entailments and signatures we consider are\nrelative to SHIQ. The results mentioned in this section, however, can be ex-\ntended to SHOIQ and therefore OWL DL [3]. In this and the following section,\nwe have omitted a few technical details, for instance proofs of the propositions.\nThey can be found in a technical report available athttp://www.cs.man.ac.uk/\n~schneidt/publ/safe-eco-reuse-report.pdf.\n2.1 The Notions of Conservative Extension and Safety\nAs mentioned in Section 1, when reusing knowledge from NCI and GALEN,\nthe developer of JRAO should not change the original meaning of the reused\nconcepts. This requirement can be formalised using the notion of a conservative\nextension [4, 5]. In the following, we use Sig() to denote the signature of an\nontology or an axiom.\nDeﬁnition 1 (Conservative Extension). Let T1 ⊆T be ontologies, and S a\nsignature. We say thatT is an S-conservative extensionof T1 if, for every axiom\nα with Sig(α) ⊆ S, we have T| = α iﬀ T1 |= α; T is a conservative extension of\nT1 if T is an S-conservative extension of T1 for S = Sig(T1).\nDeﬁnition 1 applies to our example as follows: T1 = NCI is the ontology to be\nreused, T is the union of JRAO and NCI,S represents the symbols reused from\nNCI, such as JRA and Rheumatologic\n Disorder,a n dα stands for any axiom over\nthe reused symbols only, e.g., JRA ⊑ Rheumatologic\n Disorder.\n188 E. Jim´ enez-Ruiz et al.\nDeﬁnition 1 assumes that the ontology to be reused (e.g. NCI) is static. In\npractice, however, ontologies such as NCI are under development and may evolve\nbeyond the control of the JRAO developers. Thus, it is convenient to keep NCI\nseparate from the JRAO and make its axioms available on demand via a reference\nsuch that the developers of the JRAO need not commit to a particular version\nof NCI. The notion ofsafety [3] can be seen as a stronger version of conservative\nextension that abstracts from the particular ontology to be reused and focuses\nonly on the reused symbols.\nDeﬁnition 2 (Safety for a Signature). Let T be an ontology and S as i g n a -\nture. We say thatT is safe forS if, for every ontologyT ′with Sig(T )∩Sig(T ′) ⊆\nS, we have that T∪ T ′ is a conservative extension of T ′.\n2.2 The Notion of Module\nAs mentioned in Section 1, by importing only a fragment of NCI and GALEN,\none should not lose important information. This idea can be formalised using\nthe notion of a module [3]. Intuitively, when checking an arbitrary entailment\nover the signature of the JRAO, importing a module of NCI should give exactly\nthe same answers as if the whole NCI had been imported.\nDeﬁnition 3 (Module for a Signature). Let T ′\n1 ⊆T ′ be ontologies and S\na signature. We say that T ′\n1 is a module for S in T ′ (or an S-module in T ′)\nif, for every ontology T with Sig(T ) ∩ Sig(T ′) ⊆ S, we have that T∪ T ′ is a\nconservative extension of T∪ T ′\n1 for Sig(T ).\nThe notions of safety and module are related as follows:\nProposition 4 ([3], Safety vs. Modules). If T ′\\T ′\n1 is safe for S ∪ Sig(T ′\n1 ),\nthen T ′\n1 is an S-module in T ′.\n2.3 Locality Conditions\nThe decision problems associated with conservative extensions, safety and mod-\nules—i.e., whether T is an S-conservative extension of T1,w h e t h e rT is safe\nfor S,o rw h e t h e rT ′\n1 is an S-module in T —are undecidable for SHOIQ [6, 3].\nSuﬃcient conditions for safety have been proposed: if an ontology satisﬁes such\nconditions, then we can guarantee that it is safe, but the converse does not\nnecessarily hold [3]. By means of Proposition 4, such conditions could be used\nfor extracting modules. A particularly useful condition islocality [3]: it is widely\napplicable in practice and it can be checked syntactically.\nA sm e n t i o n e di nS e c t i o n1 ,w h e nu s i n gas y m b o lf r o mN C Io rG A L E N ,t h e\nJRAO developers may reﬁne it, extend it, or refer to it for expressing a property\nof another symbol. The simultaneous reﬁnement and generalisation of a given\n“external” symbol, however, may compromise safety. For example, JRAO cannot\nsimultaneously contain the following axioms:\nPolyarticular\n JRA ⊑ JRA\n (⊥-local) (1)\nJuvenile\n Chronic\n Polyarthritis\n ⊑ Polyarticular\n JRA (⊤ -local) (2)\nSafe and Economic Re-Use of Ontologies 189\nwhere the underlined concepts are reused from NCI, see Figure 1. These axioms\nimply Juvenile\n Chronic\n Polyarthritis ⊑ JRA, and therefore an ontology containing\naxioms (1) and (2) is not safe w.r.t. S = {JRA, Juvenile\n Chronic\n Polyarthritis}.\nThus, when designing suﬃcient conditions for safety, we are faced with a fun-\ndamental choice depending on whether the ontology designer wants to reuse or\ngeneralise the reused concepts. Each choice leads to a diﬀerent locality condition.\nThe following deﬁnition introduces these conditions and refers to Figure 2. In\nthis ﬁgure, A† and R† stand for concept and role names not in S. The letters C\nand R denote arbitrary concepts and roles.\nDeﬁnition 5 (Syntactic ⊥-Locality and ⊤ -Locality). Let S be a signature.\nAn axiom α is ⊥-local w.r.t.

S = {Juvenile\n Chronic\n Polyarthritis},a n dA x i o m( 1 )\nis ⊥-local w.r.t. S = {JRA}. Note that the locality conditions allow us to refer to\na reused concept for expressing a property of some other concept; for example,\nthe axiom Polyarticular\n JRA ⊑ ⩾ 5 aﬀects.Joint\n is ⊥-local w.r.t. S = {Joint}.\nBoth ⊤ -locality and ⊥-locality are suﬃcient for safety:\nProposition 6 ([3], Locality Implies Safety). If an ontology T is ⊥-local\nor ⊤ -local w.r.t. S,t h e nT is safe for S.\nPropositions 4 and 6 suggest the following deﬁnition of modules in terms of\nlocality.\nDeﬁnition 7. Let T1 ⊆T be ontologies, andS a signature. We say thatT1 is a\n⊥-module (⊤ -module) for S in T if T\\ T 1 is ⊥-local (⊤ -local) w.r.t. S∪Sig(T1).\nWe illustrate these notions by an example. Figure 3 (a) shows an example ontol-\nogy (TBox).

The ⊤ -module is ob-\ntained analogously and consists of S′\n5 = {A, A1,C1,D 1,F1,r1,t 1,t 2} and all\naxioms α ∈T with Sig(α) ⊆ S′\n5.\nIt is clear that ⊥-modules and ⊤ -modules are modules as in Deﬁnition 3:\nProposition 8 ([3], Locality-based Modules are Modules). Let T1 be ei-\nther a ⊥-module or a ⊤ -module for S in T and let S′= S ∪ Sig(T1).T h e nT1 is\nan S′-module in T .\nThese modules enjoy an important property which determines their scope: sup-\npose that T1 (T2)i sa ⊥-module (⊤ -module) for S in T ,t h e nT1 (T2) will contain\nall super-concepts (sub-concepts) in T of all concepts in S:\nProposition 9 ([3], Module Scope). Let T be an ontology, X,Y be concept\nnames in T ∪ {⊤} ∪ {⊥} , α := (X ⊑ Y ), β := (Y ⊑ X),a n dTX ⊆T with\nX ∈ S. Then the following statements hold.\n(i) If TX is a ⊥-module in T for S,t h e nTX |= α iﬀ T| = α.\n(ii) If TX is a ⊤ -module in T for S,t h e nTX |= β iﬀ T| = β.\nFor example, if we were to reuse the conceptJRA from NCI as shown in Figure 1\nby extracting a ⊥-module for a signature that contains JRA, such a module\nwould contain all the super-concepts ofJRA in NCI, namelyRheumatoid\n Arthritis,\nAutoimmune\n Disease, Rheumatologic\n Disorder, Arthritis,a n d Arthropathy.S i n c e\nsuch a fragment is a module, it will contain the axioms necessary for entailing\nthose subsumption relations between the listed concepts that hold in NCI.\nSafe and Economic Re-Use of Ontologies 191\nFinally, given T and S, there is a unique minimal ⊥-module and a unique\nminimal ⊤ -module for S in T [3]. We denote these modules byUpMod(T , S)a n d\nLoMod(T , S). This is motivated by the alternative terms “upper/lower module”\nthat refer to the property from Proposition 9. Following a similar approach as\nexempliﬁed in Figure 3 (b), the modules can be computed eﬃciently [3].\n3 A Novel Methodology for Ontology Reuse\nBased on our scenario in Section 1 and the theory of modularity summarised\nin Section 2, we propose a novel methodology for designing an ontology when\nknowledge is to be borrowed from several external ontologies. This methodology\nprovides precise guidelines for ontology developers to follow, and ensures that a\nset of logical guarantees will hold at certain stages of the design process.\n3.1 The Methodology\nWe propose the working cycle given in Figure 4. This cycle consists of an oﬀ-\nline phase—which is performed independently from the current contents of the\nexternal ontologies—and an online phase—where knowledge from the external\nontologies is extracted and transferred into the current ontology. Note that this\nseparation is not strict: The ﬁrst phase is called “oﬄine” simply because it does\nnot need to be performed online. However, the user may still choose to do so.\nThe Oﬄine Phase starts with the ontology T being developed, e.g., JRAO.\nThe ontology engineer speciﬁes the set S of symbols to be reused from external\nontologies, and associates to each symbol the external ontology from which it\nwill be borrowed. In Figure 4 this signature selection is represented in theRepeat\nloop: each Si ⊆ S represents the external symbols to be borrowed from a partic-\nular ontology T ′\ni ; in our example, we have S = S1 ⊎ S2,w h e r eS1 is associated\nwith NCI and contains JRA, and S2 is associated with GALEN and contains\nsymbols related to joints and drugs. This part of the oﬄine phase may involve\nan “online” component since the develop er may browse through the external\nontologies to choose the symbols she wants to import.\nNext, the ontology developer decides, for eachSi, whether she wants to reﬁne\nor generalise the symbols from this set. For instance, in the reuse example shown\nin Figure 1, the concept JRA from NCI is reﬁned by the sub-concepts abbreviated\nC1,...,C 7. In both cases, the user may also reference the external symbols via\nroles; in our example, certain types of JRA are deﬁned by referencing concepts in\nGALEN (e.g., joints) via the roles aﬀects and isTreatedBy. As argued in Section\n1, reﬁnement and generalisation, combined with reference, constitute the main\npossible intentions when reusing external knowledge. Therefore it is reasonable\nfor the user, both from the modelling and tool design perspectives, to declare\nher intention. This step is represented by the For loop in Figure 4.\nAt this stage, we want to ensure that the designer of T does not change the\noriginal meaning of the reused concepts, independently of what their particular\nmeaning is in the external ontologies. This requirement can be formalised using\nthe notion of safety introduced in Section 2:\n192 E.

Given an ontology T and signatures\nS1,..., Sn, T guarantees safety if T is safe for Si for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.\nIn the next subsection, we will show how to guarantee safety.\nIn the Online Phase, the ontology engineer imports the relevant knowledge\nfrom each of the external ontologies. As argued in Section 1 and 2, we aim at\nextracting only those fragments from the external ontologies that are relevant\nto the reused symbols, and therefore the extracted fragments should be modules\nin the sense of Deﬁnition 3.\nAs shown in Figure 4, the import for each external ontology T ′\ni is performed\nin four steps. First,T ′\ni is loaded; by doing so, the ontology engineer commits to a\nparticular version of it. Second, the scope of the module to be extracted fromT ′\ni\nis customised; in practice, this means that the ontology engineer is given a view\nof T ′\ni and enabled to extendSi by specifying requirements such as: “The module\nhas to contain the concept ‘joint’, all its direct super-concepts and two levels of\nits sub-concepts”. In the third step, the actual fragment of T ′\ni is extracted. At\nthis stage, we should ensure that the extracted fragment is a module for the cus-\ntomised signature according to Deﬁnition 3. Therefore, the following guarantee\nshould be provided for each external ontology and customised signature:\nSafe and Economic Re-Use of Ontologies 193\nDeﬁnition 11 (Module Coverage Guarantee). Let S be a signature and\nT ′\nS, T ′ be ontologies with T ′\nS ⊆T ′ such that S ⊆ Sig(T ′\nS).T h e n ,T ′\nS guarantees\ncoverage of S if T ′\nS is a module for S in T ′.\nFinally, the actual module TSi is imported. The eﬀect of this import is that the\nontology T being developed evolves toT∪ TSi ; as a consequence, the safety guar-\nantee with respect to the remaining external ontologies might be compromised.\nSuch an eﬀect is obviously undesirable and hence the following guarantee should\nbe provided after the import:\nDeﬁnition 12 (Module Independence Guarantee). Given an ontology T\nand signatures S1, S2, we say that T guarantees module independence if, for all\nT1 with Sig(T ) ∩ Sig(T1) ⊆ S1, it holds that T∪ T 1 is safe for S2.\n3.2 Achieving the Logical Guarantees\nIn order to provide the necessary guarantees of our methodology, we will now\nmake use of the locality conditions introduced in Section 2.3 and some general\nproperties of conservative extensions, safety and modules.\nThe Safety Guarantee. In Section 2.3, we argue that the simultaneous re-\nﬁnement and generalisation of an exter nal concept may compromise safety. To\npreserve safety, we propose to use two locality conditions: ⊥-locality, suitable\nfor reﬁnement, and ⊤ -locality, suitable for generalisation. These conditions can\nbe checked syntactically using the grammars deﬁned in Figure 2, and therefore\nthey can be easily implemented in a tool. In order to achieve the safety guaran-\ntee at the end of the oﬄine phase, we propose to follow the procedure sketched\nin Figure 5, where “locality of T for Si according to the choice for Si”m e a n s\n⊥-locality if Si is to be reﬁned and ⊤ -locality if Si is to be generalised.\nInput:\nT : Ontology\nS1,..., Sn: disjoint signatures\na choice among reﬁnement and generalisation for each Si\nOutput:\nontology T1 that guarantees safety\n1: T1 := T\n2: while exists Si such that T not local according to the selection for Si do\n3: check locality of T1 w.r.t.

Jim´ enez-Ruiz et al.\nIt is immediate to see that the following holds upon completion of the proce-\ndure: for each Si, if the user selected the reﬁnement (generalisation) view, then\nT is ⊥-local (⊤ -local) w.r.t. Si. This is suﬃcient to guarantee safety, as given\nby the following proposition:\nProposition 13. Let T be an ontology and S = S1 ⊎ ... ⊎ Sn be the union of\ndisjoint signatures. If, for each Si,e i t h e rT is ⊥-local or ⊤ -local w.r.t. Si,t h e n\nT guarantees safety.\nThe Module Coverage Guarantee. The fragment extracted for each cus-\ntomised signature in the online phase must satisfy the module coverage guar-\nantee. As seen in Section 2.3, ⊥-locality and ⊤ -locality can also be used for\nextracting modules in the sense of Deﬁnition 3. Given an external ontology T ′\na n dc u s t o m i s e ds i g n a t u r eSi, the scope of the ⊥-module and ⊤ -module is deter-\nmined by Proposition 9: as shown in Figure 3, the⊥-module will contain all the\nsuper-concepts in T ′ of the concepts in Si,w h e r e a st h e⊤ -module will contain\nall the sub-concepts.\nThe construction in Figure 3 also shows that the extraction of ⊥-modules or\n⊤ -modules may introduce symbols not in Si, and potentially unnecessary. To\nmake the module as small as possible, we proceed as follows, given T ′\ni and Si:\nﬁrst, extract the minimal ⊥-module M for S in T ′\ni ; then, extract the minimal\n⊤ -module for S in M. The fragment obtained at the end of this process satisﬁes\nthe module coverage guarantee as given in the following proposition:\nProposition 14. Let T ′\n2 = LoMod(UpMod(T ′, S), S).T h e nT ′\n2 guarantees cov-\nerage of S in T ′.\nThe Module Independence Guarantee. When a module is imported in the\nonline phase (see Figure 4), module independence should be guaranteed—that\nis, importing a module for a signature Si from an external ontology T ′\ni into T\nshould not aﬀect the safety of T w.r.t. to the other external ontologies. The\nfollowing proposition establishes that this guarantee always holds provided that\nthe imported module in T ′\ni does not share symbols with the remaining external\nontologies T ′\nj . In practice, this is always the default situation since diﬀerent\nreference ontologies have diﬀerent namespaces and therefore their signatures are\ndisjoint. The following proposition is an immediate consequence of the syntactic\ndeﬁnition of ⊥-locality and ⊤ -locality.\nProposition 15. Let T be an ontology andS1, S2 disjoint signatures. If, for each\ni =1 , 2, T is ⊥-local or⊤ -local w.r.t.Si,t h e nT guarantees module independence.\n4 The Ontology Reuse Tool\nWe have developed a Prot´eg´e4 6 plugin that supports the methodology pre-\nsented in Section 3. The plugin and user manual can be downloaded from\nhttp://krono.act.uji.es/people/Ernesto/safety-ontology-reuse.\n6 Ontology Editor Prot´eg´e4 : http://www.co-ode.org/downloads/protege-x/\nSafe and Economic Re-Use of Ontologies 195\nFig. 6.Prot´eg´e Safe Manager Interface\nThe OﬄinePhase. The ﬁrst step of the oﬄine phase involves the selection of the\nexternal entities. Our plugin provides functionality for declaring entities as exter-\nnal as well as for deﬁning the external ontology URI (or signature subgroup) for the\nselected entities; this information is stored in the ontology using OWL 1.1 annota-\ntions [7] as follows: we use an ontology annotation axiom per external ontology, an\nentity annotation axiom to declare an entity external, and an entity annotation ax-\niom per external entity to indicate its external ontology.The set of external entities\nwith the same external ontology URI can be viewed as one of theSi. Finally, the UI\nof the plugin also allows for the speciﬁcation, for each external ontology, whether\nit will be reﬁned or generalised. Once the external entities have been declared and\ndivided into groups, the tool allows for safety checking of the ontology under de-\nvelopment w.r.t. each group of external symbols separately. The safety check uses\n⊥-locality (⊤ -locality) for signature groups that adopt the reﬁnement (generalisa-\ntion) view. The non-local axioms to be repaired are appropriately displayed.\nFigure 6 shows theSafe Prot´eg´e Manager component with the set of signature\nsubgroups in the top left corner, and the non-local axioms in the bottom left\ncorner. Note that, in this phase, our tool does allow the user to work completely\noﬀline, without the need of extracting and importing external knowledge, and\neven without knowing exactly from whichontology the reused entities will come\nfrom. Indeed, the speciﬁcation of the URI of the external ontologies is optional\nat this stage, and, even if indicated, such URI may not refer to a real ontology,\nbut it may simply act as a temporary name.\nThe Online Phase. In the online phase, the user chooses external ontologies\nand imports axioms from them. At this stage, the groups of external symbols to\n196 E. Jim´ enez-Ruiz et al.\nFig. 7. Module information obtained from Galen. (left) Module average size against\nmax size. (right) Frequency distributions for module sizes.\nbe imported should refer to the location of a “real” external ontology. Once an\nexternal signature group Si has been selected for import, the selected signature\ncan be customised by adding super-con cepts and sub-concepts of the selected\nsymbols. The tool provides the functionality for previewing the concept hierar-\nchy of the corresponding external ontology for this purpose. Once the speciﬁc\nsignature group under consideration has been customised, a module for it can\nbe extracted. The module is computed using the procedure in Proposition 14;\nthe user can compute the module, preview it in a separate frame, and either\nimport it or cancel the process and come back to the signature customisation\nstage. The user is also given the option to import the whole external ontology\ninstead of importing a module. Note that currently the import of a module is\ndone “by value”, in the sense that the module becomes independent from the\noriginal ontology: if the external ontology on the Web evolves, the previously\nextracted module will not change.\nThe right hand side of the Safe Prot´eg´e Manager component (see Figure 6)\nincludes the set of necessary components to support the proposed steps for the\nonline phase.\n5 Evaluation\nSo far, we have demonstrated our tool to various ontology developers7 who have\nexpressed great interest, and we are currently working on a proper user study.\nI nt h ef o l l o w i n g ,w ed e s c r i b et h ee x p e r iments we have performed to prove that\nlocality-based modules are reasonably sized compared to the whole ontology.\n7 Thanks to Elena Beißwanger, Sebastian Brandt, Alan Rector, and Holger Stenzhorn\nfor valuable comments and feedback.\nSafe and Economic Re-Use of Ontologies 197\nFor each concept name A in NCI or Galen 8, we have proceeded as follows.\n(i) For each pair (u, ℓ) between (0, 0) and (3, 3), construct the signatureS(A, u, ℓ)\nby taking A, its super-concepts in the next u levels and its sub-concepts in the\nnext ℓ levels. (ii) Extract T ′\n1 = UpMod(T ′, SA)a n dT ′\n2 = LoMod(T ′\n1 , SA), see\nProposition 14. From now on, we will refer to the modulesT ′\n1 and T ′\n2 mentioned\nabove as “Upper Module (UM)” and “Lower of Upper Module (LUM)”.\nWe have grouped the extracted modules according to the size of the input\nsignature in order to evaluate its impact on the size of the modules. Figure 7\nshows the obtained results for Galen (3161 entities and 4170 axioms), where\nthe size of a module is the number of its axioms. The following conclusions\ncan be drawn from the empirical results: ﬁrst, the modules obtained are small\non average since 99% of UMs have at most 487 axioms ( ∼ 12% of the size\nof Galen), and 99% of the LUMs contain at most and 386 axioms ( ∼ 9% of\nthe size of Galen) for initial signatures S(A, u, ℓ) containing between 1 and 330\nentities; second, the growth in the size of the modules w.r.t. the size of the initial\nsignature is smooth and linear up to initial signatures containing 100 entities.\nWe have similar ﬁndings for NCI v3 (27,722 entities and 395,124 axioms, most\nof them annotations), NCI v7 (63,754 entities and 867,374 axioms, most of them\nannotations) and SNOMED (entities and 389,541 axioms and 389,544 entities).\nIn addition to the “synthetic” experiments, we have undertaken some real\nexperiments in the context of the Health -e-Child project’s user scenario, see\nSection 1. The experiments focus on JRA and Cardiomyopathies (CMP)—a\ngroup of diseases that are central to th e project. Using our tool, members of\nthe project have manually selected si gnatures that are relevant to JRA and\nCardiomyopathies from both Galen and NCI, expanded these signatures as in\nthe case of the synthetic tests, and extracted the corresponding modules. For\nexample, in the case of JRA in Galen, the initial signature and expanded signa-\nture consisted of 40 and 131 entities. The following tables show the sizes of all\nsignatures and modules extracted from (a) Galen and (b) NCI.\n(a) Disease\n JRA JRA CMP (b) Disease\n JRA JRA CMP\nSignature size\n 40 131 77 Signature size\n 48 356 124\n#a x i o m s\n 490 1151 614 # axioms\n 300 1258 537\n#c o n c e p t s\n 296 663 334 # concepts\n 193 613 283\n#r o l e s\n 69 116 56 # roles\n 17 21 10\n6 Related Work\nOntology Engineering Methodologies:Severalontologyengineeringmethod-\nologies can be found in the literature; prominent examples are Methontology [8],\nOn-To-Knowledge (OTK) [9], and ONTOCLEAN [10]. These methodologies, how-\never,do not addressontologydevelopment scenariosinvolving reuse.Our proposed\nmethodology is complementary and can be used in combination with them.\n8 We have used a fragment of GALEN expressible in OWL:\nhttp://krono.act.uji.es/Links/ontologies/galen.owl/view\n198 E. Jim´ enez-Ruiz et al.\nOntology Segmentation and Ontology Integration Techniques: In the\nlast few years, a growing body of work has been developed addressing Ontology\nModularisation, Ontology Mapping and Alignment, Ontology Merging, Ontology\nIntegration and Ontology Segmentation, see [11, 12, 13] for surveys. This ﬁeld\nis diverse and has originated from diﬀerent communities.\nIn particular, numerous techniques for extracting fragments of ontologies.\nMost of them, such as [14, 15, 16], rely on syntactic heuristics for detecting\nrelevant axioms. These techniques do not attempt to formally specify the in-\ntended outputs and do not provide any guarantees.\nOntology Reuse techniques: There are various proposals for “safely” com-\nbining modules; most of these proposals, such as E-connections, Distributed\nDescription Logics and Package-based Description Logics propose a specialised\nsemantics for controlling the interaction between the importing and the imported\nmodules to avoid side-eﬀects, for an overview see [17]. In contrast, in our paper\nwe assume that reuse is performed by simply building the logical union of the\naxioms in the modules under the standard semantics; instead, we provide the\nuser with a collection of rea soning services, such as safety testing, to check for\nside-eﬀects. Our paper is based on other work on modular reuse of ontologies\n[18, 19, 6, 5] which enables us to provide the necessary guarantees. We extend\nthis work with a methodology and tool support.\n7 Lessons Learned and Future Work\nWe have described a logic-based approach to the reuse of ontologies that is both\nsafe (i.e., we guarantee that the meaning of the imported symbols is not changed)\nand economic (i.e., we import only the module relevant for a given set of symbol\nand we guarantee that we do not lose any entailments compared to the import\nof the whole ontology). We have described a methodology that makes use of\nthis approach, have implemented tool support for it in Prot´eg´e, and report on\nexperiments that indicate that our modules are indeed of acceptable size.\nIn the future, we will extend the tool support so that the user can “shop” for\nsymbols to reuse: it will allow to browse an ontology for symbols to reuse and\nprovide a simple mechanism to pick them and, on “check-out”, will compute the\nrelevant module. Moreover, we are working on more eﬃcient ways of module\nextraction that make use of already ex isting computations. Next, we plan to\ncarry out a user study to learn more about the usefulness of the interface and\nhow to further improve it. Finally, our current tool support implements a “by\nvalue” mechanism: modules are extract ed and added at the user’s request. In\naddition, we would like to support import “by reference”: a feature that checks\nwhether the imported ontology has changed and thus a new import is necessary.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was partially supported by the PhD Fellowship Program of the Ge-\nneralitat Valenciana,b yt h eFundaci´o Caixa Castell´o-Bancaixa,a n db yt h eU K\nEPSRC grant no.
