In this paper, a declarative foundation for process models is \nproposed. Three issues in process management and modeling are identified: \nbusiness orientation, traceability, and flex ibility. It is shown how these issues \ncan be addressed by basing process models on business models, where a \nbusiness model focuses on the transfer of  value between agents. As a bridge \nbetween business models and process models, the notion of activity dependency \nmodel is introduced, which identifies, classifies, and relates activities needed \nfor executing and coordinating value transfers. \n1   Introduction \nFor information processing systems, it is possible to identify a number of functional \naspects, [16]. The basic aspect is the servic es the system provides to its environment. \nBy providing services, the system delivers value to its environment, which is the \nraison d’etre of the system. The behaviour, or process, aspect has to do with the \nordering and control flow of services and activities. The communication aspect \nconcerns interactions with other entities, like people, hardware, and software. Finally, \nthe meaning aspect addresses the interpretation of symbols used in services. The \nprocess aspect is attracting ev er more attention, as witnessed by the advent of new \nworkflow and process management systems, new process modeling languages, and \ndedicated journals and conferences. Despite their success, process technologies and in \nparticular process modeling techniques face a number of shortcomings and challenges \nthat need to be addressed. In this paper, we will address three of these: \n- Business Orientation. Process models are typically expressed through low \nlevel c\\setlength{oncepts like control flow structures and message passing. \nSuch concepts are not easily understood by business experts and users, who \ninstead prefer to understand processes through business oriented notions like \nvalue exchanges and resource flows. \n- Traceability. Constructing a process model includes taking a number of \ndesign decisions that affect the structure of the model. It should be possible \nto trace these design decisions back to explanations and motivations \nexpressed in business terms. \n234 B. Andersson et al. \n \n- Flexibility. In most processes, the main structure is stable over time, while \ndetails may vary from case to case. Process models and systems should, \ntherefore, allow for flexibility at design time as well as runtime. \nOne way to address these issues is to base process models on business models. By \nbusiness model we mean a model which focuses on providing a high level view of the \nactivities taking place by identifying agents, resources and the exchange of resources \nbetween the agents [12]. A process model, on the other hand, deals with operational \nand procedural aspects of business communication by focusing on the activities \ncarried out by agents [1]. As the process m odel concentrates on technical details like \nhow these activities will be carried out on the operational level, it becomes difficult \nfor business users to understand it. Because of this it is hard for business experts and \nusers to understand the connection between the high level view of the business model \nand the technical view of the process model.  \nThe purpose of this paper is to propose a declarative foundation of process models \nbased on business models. In order to bridge the gap between business models and \nprocess models, we introduce the notion of activity dependency model, which identifies, \nclassifies, and relates activities needed for executing and coordinating value transfers. \nHaving a declarative foundation will make it easier for designers to justify their design \ndecisions at the technical level and trace them back to a business model. The paper \nbuilds upon and extends previous work, [1], by taking into account not only value \ntransfer activities but also complimentary activities needed for their execution.  \nThe paper is structured as follows. Section 2 gives an overview of related research. \nSection 3 gives an overview of business models. Section 4 introduces activity \ndependency models and shows how they are related to business models. Section 5 \ngives an overview of process models in a specific notation (BPMN [4]) and shows \nhow they can be derived from activity dependency models. Finally, Section 6 \nconcludes the paper and gives suggestions for further research. \n2   Related Research \nThere exist several approaches to provide interfaces between technical concepts of \nsoftware and systems design and business oriented requirements engineering. One of \nthe most widely accepted approaches is the Unified Modeling Language, UML, with \nassociated methodologies like RUP [13], where various types of design models \nrepresent static information in class diagrams as well as behavioral aspects modeled \nin interaction and activity diagrams. The UN/CEFACT Modeling Methodology \n(UMM) [15] uses UML as a base for specifying business processes involving \ninformation exchange in a technology-neutral and implementation-independent \nmanner.  A weak point in utilizing methodologies such as these, is still how to go \nfrom a business model to a process model in a systematic way. The DEMO \nmethodology [5] was developed for the purpose of modeling essential business \nprocesses, abstracting completely from thei r realization. DEMO particularly stresses \nthe distinction between information processes (generally modeled through low level \nmessage protocols) and the actual business processes, e.g. production acts where the \nagents fulfill the mission of the organization and coordination acts where agents enter \ninto and comply with commitments. Dietz divides the collaboration between agents \n A Declarative Foundation of Process Models 235 \n \ninto three distinct phases. The Ordering phase , in which an Agent requests some \nResource from another Agent who, in turn, promises to fulfill the request. The \nExecution phase , in which the Agents perform Activities in order to fulfill their \npromises. The Result phase, in which an Agent declares a transfer of Resource control \nto be finished, followed by the acceptance or rejection by the other Agent. The ISO \nOPEN-EDI initiative [8] identifies five phases: Planning, Identification, Negotiation, \nActualization and Post-Actualization. In this paper, we use only two phases: a \nNegotiation phase  in which commitments are proposed and accepted, and an \nExecution phase  in which transfers of Resources between Agents occur and are \nacknowledged.  \nThe approach proposed in this paper resembles DEMO since we also utilize the \ndistinction between production processes and coordination processes. In our work this \ndivision among processes (or activities) is systematically derived from a business \nmodel through a set of activity dependencies, all expressed in business terms such as \ntrust, commitments and transfer of value be tween agents [7] [11]. A similar approach \nmay be found in the i* framework [17],  which has been explored for modeling trust \nrelationships among strategic actors .The activity dependency models of this paper \nmay be used as a modeling means to reason about design decisions, just as the models \nare in i*. However, the specific aim of the activity dependency models here is to automate the \nprocess of going from business to process model. \nIn building process models, both an internal and external perspective on \ninteractions between agents must be observed. In the Agent-Object-Relationship \n(AOR) approach [14], organizations and organizational behavior are modeled in two \nbasic types of models: external and internal ones. An external AOR model adopts the \nperspective of an external observer who is observing agents and their interactions in \nthe problem domain under consideration. In an internal AOR model, the internal \n(first-person) view of a particular agent to be modeled is taken. This notion is \nmirrored in our work, i.e. the activity dependency models introduced always take the \nview of one particular agent. Moreover, any interaction from one agent with respect to \nanother agent has its counterpart in that other agent’s activity model, i.e. one agent’s \ninternal activity is modeled as the other agent’s external ditto. PayInvoice as an \nactivity in one model has a reciprocal relationship with a ReceivePayment activity in \nthe model of the corresponding agent. While AOR uses the internal business models \nas a point of departure to define so called interaction frames to describe the \ncollaboration between agents, the work reported on in this paper suggests a way to \nautomatically derive process models from business models. The proposed approach \nyields a process model that contains the main procedural logic. To get additional \nprocedural details for sub-processes the notion of generic process patterns is used. \nThe hypothesis is that most process models for organizational domains may be \nexpressed as a combination of well documented design patterns [6] [9]. \n3   Business Models \nThe purpose of a business model is to describe and visualise the transfer of value \nbetween agents. A business model consists of three components: agents, value \ntransfer offerings, and dualities. An agent is a person or (part of) an organisation that \n236 B. Andersson et al. \n \nis capable of controlling, acquiring, and providing resources. Examples of agents are \nconsumers, companies, and government authorities. An agent may transfer resources \nto another agent in a value transfer, e.g. the delivery of a product or a payment. A \nvalue transfer offering represents the willingness of an agent to perform value \ntransfers with other agents. In a business setting, it never happens that one agent \nsimply transfers a resource to another ag ent - she always expects to get another \nresource back as compensation. As the saying goes, “one good turn deserves another”. \nTo represent this reciprocity between value transfer offerings, we introduce the notion \nof duality. A duality associates two or more reciprocal value transfer offerings, e.g. \nthe willingness to deliver a product and to pay for it. \n \nProgram Committee\nConference\nSteering Committee\nReviewers\nAuthors\nSubmission\nAcknowledgement\nReview Report\nPayment\nConference\nProgram\nEvaluation\n \nFig. 1. A Business Model \nAn example of a simple business model for the well-known scientific conference \ncase is shown in Fig. 1. For space restrictions, we only consider the submission and \nacceptance part of the case. Authors (agent) can submit papers (value transfer \noffering) to the program committee (agent), who in return (duality) provides the \nauthors with evaluations and decisions for acceptance (value transfer offering). In \norder to make the decisions, the program committee obtains review reports (value \ntransfer offering) from reviewers (agents), who in return (duality) will get \nacknowledgements in the conference documentation (value transfer offering). The \nprogram committee will based on submitted papers and reviews deliver a conference \nprogram (value transfer offering) to the conference steering committee (agent), who \nin return (duality) provides financial reimbursement (value transfer offering). In Fig. \n3.1, individual agents are represented by pl ain ovals, classes of agents by shadowed \novals, dualities by shadowed small rectangles, and value transfer offerings by arrows \nbetween dualities and agents (either individual agents or classes of agents). More \nprecisely, a business model is defined as follows. \nDefinition 3.1:  A business model is a directed graph with three types of nodes \nIndAgt, ClassAgt, Dual  and directed edges called VTO from Dual to ( IndAgt ∪ \nClassAgt). IndAgt, ClassAgt  and VTO are sets representing Individual Agents, Class \nAgents and Value Transfer Offering between these Agents, respectively. Dual is a set \n A Declarative Foundation of Process Models 237 \n \nof dualities where a duality d is a relation over ( IndAgt ∪ ClassAgt) x VTO x (IndAgt \n∪ ClassAgt) with the following property: if (x, y, z) ∈ d then ∃ w ∈ VTO such that (z, \nw, x) ∈ d                ■ \n4   Activity Dependency Models \n4.1   Concepts and Notation for Activity Dependency Models \nThe purpose of an activity dependency model is to describe, on a high level, the \nactivities needed for carrying out the value transfers specified in a business model. An \nactivity dependency model provides more detail than a business model by identifying, \nclassifying, and relating activities needed for executing and coordinating value \ntransfers. On the other hand, an activity dependency model is less detailed than a \nprocess model, as it abstracts from ordering and control flow aspects. In this way, \nactivity dependency models occupy a middle ground between business models and \nprocess models where they provide business-oriented information on activity \ncoordination without going into procedural details. An activity dependency model is \nalways constructed from a particular agent’s perspective, called the base actor, i.e. the \nmodel takes the internal view as discussed in Section 2. This means that an activity \ndependency model focuses on one agent in a business model and the dualities \ninvolving this agent. \nStructurally, an activity dependency model can be seen as a graph with four kinds \nof nodes, representing activities, and four kinds of directed edges, representing \nrelationships between activities. The four kinds of activities are: \n-  Value transfer activities.  A value transfer activity transfers resources from one \nagent to another and corresponds directly to the value transfer offerings in a \nbusiness model. \n-  Assignment activities.  An assignment activity relates a specific agent from a \nclass of agents to the value transfer activities of one duality. An example is the \nassignment of a reviewer for reviewing a particular paper. \n-  Production activities.  In a production activity, the base actor produces a \nresource required for a value transfer activity.  \n-  Coordination activities.  A coordination activity coordinates the value transfer \nactivities within one duality as well as additional assignment and production \nactivities. \nThe four kinds of relationships between activities are: \n-  Duality dependencies.  A duality dependency from a coordination activity to a \nvalue transfer activity expresses that the latter is included in the duality of the \nformer; recall that each coordination activity corresponds to one duality.  \n-  Flow dependencies.  A flow dependency, [10], from one activity to another \nexpresses that the resource obtained by the first activity is needed as input to the \nsecond activity. An example is a retailer who has to obtain a product from an \nimporter before delivering it to a customer. \n238 B. Andersson et al. \n \n-  Trust dependencies.  A trust dependency [1], between two value transfer \nactivities within the same duality expresses that the first activity has to be \ncarried out before the second one as a consequence of low trust between the \ninvolved agents. Informally, a trust dependency states that one agent wants to see \nthe other agent do her work before doing his own work. An example could be a \ncar dealer requiring a down payment from a customer before delivering a car. \n-  Trigger dependencies. A trigger dependency from a coordination activity to an \nassignment or production activity expresses that the latter is to be initiated and \nmanaged by the coordination activity. \nThe components of an activity dependency model have a clear business motivation, \ni.e. they can be explained and motivated in business terms. This makes the activity \ndependency model a useful instrument for eliciting and communicating business \nknowledge. At the same time, an activity dependency model provides an adequate basis \nfor constructing more detailed process models, as will be discussed in the next section. \n \nFig. 2. An Activity Dependency Model \nAn example of an activity dependency model is shown in Fig. 2, which is based on \nthe business model from the previous section. The base actor is the program \ncommittee, and the diagram shows three columns of coordination and value transfer \nactivities corresponding to the dualities of this actor. There is one assignment activity \nAssignReviewer (for assigning a reviewer to a paper), one production activity \nDecideOnAcceptance (for deciding whether to select a paper), and a number of flow, \n A Declarative Foundation of Process Models 239 \n \ntrust, and trigger dependencies. For example, there is a flow dependency from \nAssignReviewer to AcquireReview meaning that an assignment of a reviewer to a \npaper must exist before a review of that paper can be obtained. Furthermore, \ncardinalities (as in UML) have been attached to some of the dependencies. For \nexample, the star on the flow dependency from AcquireSubmission to AssignReviewer \nmeans that for each submitted paper, several assignments of reviewers may exist. \nDefinition 4.1: An activity dependency model is a directed graph with four types of \nnodes VTA, Coord, Ass, Prod and four types of directed edges Dual, Flow, Trust, and \nTrigger; where VTA, Coord, Ass,  and Prod are sets representing value transfer \nactivities, coordination activities, assignme nt activities, and production activities, \nrespectively and Dual, Flow, Trust and Trigger are relations such that: \n• Dual is an injective relation over Coord x VTA. \n• Flow is a relation over (VTA ∪ Ass ∪ Prod)  x (VTA ∪ Ass ∪ Prod) x {1, *} \nx {1, *} such that,  if  (x, y, z, w) ∈ Flow  then (x, y) ∈ {(VTA ∪ Ass ∪ Prod) \nx (VTA ∪ Ass ∪ Prod) \\ (Ass x (Ass ∪ Prod))} and (z, w) ∈ ({1,*} x {1,*}) \n• Trust is a relation over VTA x VTA within the same duality \n• Trigger is a relation over Coord x (Ass ∪ Prod            ■ \n4.2   From Business Model to Activity Dependency Model \nAn activity dependency model can partially be derived from the business model it is \nbased on. Each duality in the business model gives rise to one coordination activity, \nand each value transfer in the business model gives rise to one value transfer activity. \nThe value transfer activities within one duality are related to the corresponding \ncoordination activity by duality dependencies. Furthermore, for dua lities where the \nbase actor may choose between several agents in a class of agents (for example \nchoosing a reviewer for a paper), an assignment activity is added. For each duality, \none production activity may also be added when the base actor has to produce some \nresource needed for a value transfer activ ity. These components of the activity \ndependency model are directly derived from the business model, but the activity \ndependency model will also contain a number of additional components not derivable \nfrom the business model, namely the flow, trust, and trigger dependencies. \nDefinition 4.2: Let BM = < IndAgt, ClassAgt, Dual, VTO > be a business model. Let \nAM = < VTA, Coord, Ass, Prod, Dual, Flow, Trust, Trigger > be an activity \ndependency model. AM conforms to BM if  \n• for each duality in Dual there is one coordination activity in Coord \n• for each value transfer in VTO there is one value transfer activity in VTA \n• for each element d = <x, y, z> in a duality in BM- Dual there is a pair <c, v> \nin AM-Dual, where c is the coordination activity corresponding to d and v is \nthe value transfer activity corresponding to y, and a pair <c, w> where c is \nthe same coordination activity and w is a value transfer activity \ncorresponding to z. \n \n \n240 B. Andersson et al. \n \n• for each d in Dual, there is optionally one production activity in Prod \n• for each d in Dual related to an element in ClassAgt, there is one assignment \nactivity in As               ■ \n5   Process Models \n5.1   Concepts and Notation for Process Models \nThe notation we will use for process models is BPMN [4], a standard developed by \nthe Business Process Management Initiative (BPMI) [3]. The goal of BPMN is to be \nan easily comprehensible notation for a wide spectrum of stakeholders ranging from \nbusiness domain experts to technical developers. A feature of BPMN is that BPMN \nspecifications can be readily mapped to executable XML languages for process \nspecifications such as BPEL4WS [2]. \nIn this paper, we will use only a selected set of core elements from BPMN. These \nelements are Activities, Events, Gateways, Sequence Flows, Message Flows, Pools \nand Lanes. Activity is a generic term for work that an Agent can perform. In a BPMN \ndiagram, an Activity is represented by a rounded rectangle. An Activity can be atomic \nor compound. A Compound Activity is composed of other Activities and will be \nmarked by a ‘+’ sign inside the rounded rectangle. An Activity may also be repeated, \nwhich is graphically shown by a circular arrow inside the rounded rectangle. Events, \nrepresented as circles, are something that “happens” during the course of a business \nprocess. There exist three types of Events: Start, End and Intermediate Events.  \nActivities and Events are connected by Sequence Flows, shown as arrows, indicating \nthe order in which Activities will be performed in a business process. Gateways are \nused to control the Sequence Flows by determining branching, forking, merging, and \njoining of paths. In this paper we will restrict our attention to XOR and AND \nbranching, graphically shown as a diamond with an ‘X’ or ‘+’, respectively. Pools are \ngraphical constructs, in the form of oblong rectangles enclosing other BPMN \nelements, for separating different sets of activities from each other. Message flows, \nshown as dotted arrows, are used for communication between Activities in different \nPools. An example of a BPMN process diagram is given in Fig. 3.  \n5.2   From Activity Dependency Model to Process Model \nMoving from an activity dependency model to a process model is essentially about \nspecifying the detailed control flow between activities. The starting point is to let each \ncoordination activity in the activity dependency model become a process defined \nwithin one pool. This means that each pool models the exchange of resources between \nthe base actor and one other actor as well as the assignment and production activities \nneeded for this exchange. The entire proce ss model will consist of a number of such \nprocesses within pools that communicate with each other.  \nA single pool essentially describes a binary collaboration between two partners. \nSuch a collaboration may consist of several phases as discussed in Section 2, \nincluding planning, identification, negotiation, actualisation, and post-actualisation. In \n A Declarative Foundation of Process Models 241 \n \nthis paper, we consider only two phases: one Negotiation phase in which \ncommitments for resource exchanges are proposed and accepted, and one Execution \nphase in which resource transfers occur and are acknowledged. Typically, a process \nwill contain both a Negotiation phase and an Execution phase, but in some cases only \nthe Execution phase is included. If the Negotiation phase is included, one sub-process \nfor this phase is added to the pool. Thereafter, for each value transfer activity \nassociated to the coordination activity, one sub-process is added. Furthermore, if there \nare any trigger dependencies from the coordination activity to assignment or \nproduction activities, one sub-process is added for each related assignment or \nproduction activity. There are also additional sub-processes for acquiring relevant \nresources, as specified through flow dependencies. Some of the sub-processes within \na pool will be repeating. This occurs when there is a multi-valued flow dependency to \nthe activity corresponding to the sub-process. The sub-processes are related by adding \nsequence flows between pairs of sub-processes if there is a flow or trust dependency \nbetween the corresponding activities. Finally, the negotiation sub-process is related to \nthe other sub-processes by an AND-gateway. \nAs each coordination activity gives rise to its own pool, we will end up with a \nnumber of processes in pools that have to be connected to each other via message \nflows. Two pools need to be connected if one of the pools requires a resource \nprovided by the other. There will be one message flow from the resource providing \npool to the resource requesting pool, which informs about the delivery of the resource. \nFurthermore, there will be one message flow from the resource requesting pool to the \nresource providing if the latter contains a negotiation phase; this message flow is the \nrequest for the resource.  \nAn example of a process based on the coordination activity Coordinate \nConferenceProgram in Fig. 2 is shown in Fig. 3. It is assumed that this process does \nnot contain a Negotiation phase but only an Execution phase  (for reasons of \ncompleteness we also include the processes based on the other two coordination \nactivities from Fig. 2 Coordinate Review and Coordinate Submission in Fig. 3, where \nCoordinate Review is assumed to contain a Negotiation phase) . The two value \ntransfer activities associated to CoordinateConferenceProgram give rise to two sub-\nprocesses ProvideConferenceProgramme and AcquirePayment. These and other sub-\nprocesses may have a more or less complex internal structure, and we will return to \nthis issue in Section 5.3. Two more sub-processes are added, AssignReviewer and \nDecideOnAcceptance, based on the trigger dependencies in the activity dependency \nmodel. Furthermore, sub-processes that acqui re relevant resources need to be added, \nin this case ReceiveSubmission and GetReview. ReceiveSubmission is added as there \nis a flow dependency from AcquireSubmission to ProvideConferenceProgram in the \nactivity dependency model. GetReview is added as there is a flow dependency from \nAcquireReview to DecideOnAcceptance. Finally, a sub-process DeliverEvaluation is \nadded due to the flow dependency from DecideOnAcceptance to ProvideEvaluation. \nThe sequence flows in the diagram are all derived from flow dependencies, except the \none from AcquirePayment to ProvideConferenceProgram, which is based on a trust \ndependency. Fig. 3 shows the entire process model for the conference case with \nmessage flows included. \n242 B. Andersson et al. \n \n \nFig. 3. A Process Model in BPMN \nDefinition 5.1: Let P be a pool containing an activity A. We will denote that activity \nby P.A.                       ■ \nDefinition 5.2: Let AM = < VTA, Coord, Ass, Prod,  Dual, Flow, Trust, Trigger>  be \nan activity dependency model. A coordination activity C in Coord will be related \nthrough duality dependencies to one or several value transfer activities in which the \nbase actor provides resources to another actor. These value transfer activities will be \ndenoted Out1, … ,Out n. Analogously, the value transfer activities where the base actor \nacquires resources from another actor will be denoted In1, … ,In n.                        ■ \nDefinition 5.3: Let AM = < VTA, Coord, Ass, Prod,  Dual, Flow, Trust, Trigger>  be \nan activity dependency model. Let PM be a BPMN diagram. PM conforms to AM if \nfor each coordination activity C in Coord there is one pool PC in PM fulfilling the \nfollowing conditions: \n-  PC contains optionally one sub-process entitled Negotiation \n-  For each value transfer activity Ini, there is one sub-process Ini \n-  For each value transfer activity Outi, there is one sub-process Outi \n-  For each flow dependency from an activity D.Ini (where D is a coordination \nactivity ≠ C) to a value transfer activity Outj, there is one subprocess get(D. Ini). \n A Declarative Foundation of Process Models 243 \n \nThe sub-process is repeating if the flow dependency is not injective. There is \none message flow from PD. In i to get(D. In i). If PD contains a sub-process \nNegotiation, then there is also one message flow from get(D.Ini) to \nPD.Negotiation. \n-  For each trigger dependency from C to an assignment or production activity Act, \nthere is one sub-process do(Act). The sub-process is repeating if there is a flow \ndependency from a value transfer activity D.Ini to Act and get(D. Ini) is included \nin PC and repeating, or if there is a flow dependency from Act to C.Outithat is \nmulti-valued. \n-  For each flow dependency from an activity Act to a production activity Prod \nsuch that the corresponding sub-process do(Prod) is included in PC, there is one \nsub-process do(Act). The sub-process is repeating if do(Prod) is repeating, or if \nthe flow dependency is not injective. \n-  If there is a production activity Prod with a flow dependency to a value transfer \nactivity D. Outi and the sub-process do(Prod) corresponding to Prod is included \nin PC, then there is a message flow from do(Prod) to D. Outi. \nThere is a sequence flow between two sub-processes if there is a flow dependency \nor trust dependency between the corresponding activities. When all sub-processes \nhave been linked in this way, there will be a number of leftmost sub-processes, L1, … \n,Lm , i.e. sub-processes with no incoming sequence flow. There will be a gateway G in \nPC with a sequence flow from Negotiation to G. There will be sequence flows from G \nto each of L1, … ,L m. \nFinally, if a process model PM conforms to an activity dependency model AM and \nPM´ is derived from PM as specified below, then PM´ conforms to AM. PM should \ncontain two repeating sub-processes S and T joined by a sequence flow. PM´ is \nderived from PM by replacing the repeating sub-processes and their joining sequence \nflow by one repeating sub-process containing S and T joined by a sequence flow.      ■ \nThe reason for the last paragraph of the definition is to allow for more flexibility in \nthe process design. Without it, there would be an unwanted restriction, namely how \nrepeating activities are treated. It would be assumed that if there are two subsequent \nrepeating activities then there must be a repetition over the first activity followed by a \nrepetition over the second. For example, in Fig. 3 all submissions have to be received \nbefore any assignment is made. However, this assumption is too restrictive in many \n \n \nFig. 4. An alternative Process Model in BPMN \n244 B. Andersson et al. \n \ncases, as an alternative is to have a single repetition over a sequence of the two \nactivities. For example, in Fig. 4 a received submission may be directly followed by \nan assignment. \nDue to space limitations we have only considered the success path, or “happy \npath”, of a process, i.e. we have not included exceptions, failed negotiations, etc. \nExtensions for these possibilities are obviously needed, but they are standard and do \nnot affect the basic relationships between activity dependency models and process \nmodels. \n5.3   Process Patterns \nA process model derived from an activity dependency model, as described above, \ncontains only the main procedural logic. Additional procedural details for the sub-\nprocesses of the process model are needed. On e approach is to treat sub-models as the \nmain model, i.e. detailed views of the main business model is provided and sub-\nactivities and sub-processes derived according to the transformation described in the \nprevious section. We believe, however, that a more flexible way to provide the \nprocedural details is to use the notion of process patterns. The idea is that each sub-\nprocess is based upon a generic process pattern. \nGeneric Process Patterns  \nUN/CEFACT has defined a number of business transaction patterns as part of UMM \nwith the intention of providing an established semantics of frequently occurring \nbusiness interactions. Individual sub processes such as, for example, negotiations and \nfulfillments of earlier commitments to perform value transfers are easily  expressed or \nassembled on an arbitrary level of granularity through the usage of generic transaction \npatterns. Below we list a number of patterns from [15] and [1].  \nNegotiation Phase Patterns \nThe Contract proposal [11] transaction pattern models the non-legally binding \nnegotiation phase in a contract formation, whereas the Commercial (Offer-Accept)  \n[1515] tra nsaction pattern  expresses the formal creation phase of a contract.  These \npatterns may be assembled into more complex patterns of collaborations between \npartners. An example of the latter is the UMM “simple negotiation pattern”, which \ncombines variants of proposals and offers for contracts of transfer of value resources. \nThe assembling of patterns is based on a layered approach where each base pattern \nconstitute a sub-process in the assembled pattern, and where the “happy path” \nsequence flow of each pattern serves as connector between the pattern. \n \nFig. 5. Simple Negotiation pattern [15] \n A Declarative Foundation of Process Models 245 \n \nExecution Phase Patterns \nThe fulfillment pattern specifies the completion of a Value transfer between two \npartners. The Bi- and Unilateral Cancellation transaction patterns refer to the \nunilateral or bilateral cancellation of a contract or to commitment(s) within a contract \nfor value transfers.  \n \nFig. 6. Fulfillment, Fulfillment Accept/Reject, bilateral and unilateral cancellation transaction \npatterns [1] \n \nFig. 7. Fulfillment collaboration pattern [1] \n \nFig. 8. Instantiation of Fulfillment collaboration pattern \nThe fulfillment collaboration pattern specifies relevant transaction patterns (Fig. 7) \nand the rules for transitioning among these within the completion of a value transfer. \nThe pattern is assembled from the Fulfillment and Unilateral Cancellation transaction \npatterns defined in the previous section. \nFinally, as an example of an instantiation of a generic collaboration pattern, \nconsider the case of sub-process “Get-payment” from the Conference case, where the \nprocedural details may be defined in a flexible way through combinations of generic \ntransactions patterns. In fig 8 the “Get-payment” sub-process is modeled through the \n246 B. Andersson et al. \n \nFulfillment collaboration pattern, which specifies relevant transaction patterns and the \nrules (variants of the rules for when an how to break a contract of value transfer \namounts to choosing the right combination of patterns) for transitioning among these \nwithin the completion of a value transfer. \n6   Conclusions and Further Work \nIn this paper, we have proposed a declarative foundation of process models based on \nbusiness models. A key element of the approach is the activity dependency model, \nwhich works as a bridge between a business and a process model. We believe that this \napproach effectively addresses the issues introduced in Section 1: \n- Business Orientation. Instead of going directly into procedural details, an \nactivity dependency model allows business experts and users to describe the \nunderlying business reasons that govern the flow of processes. In particular, \nrelations between activities can be specified in terms of notions like resource \nflow, trust, coordination, and reciprocity. \n- Traceability. A process model is based on an activity dependency model, \nwhich in turn is based on a business model. This means that components in a \nprocess model can be explained by and tracked back to business oriented \nnotions and motivations. \n- Flexibility. The transformations from business model to activity dependency \nmodel to process model give the main structure of a process. However, the \napproach allows for flexibility by letting sub-processes be based on patterns. \nThis means that the lower-level details of a process model can be tailored to \nthe situation at hand by selecting appropriate patterns from a repository. \nWe have introduced the notion of activity dependencies for capturing relationships \nbetween the activities within a process. Four kinds of dependencies have been \nidentified, flow, trust, trigger, and duality dependencies. These can be stated \ndeclaratively, have a clear business motiva tion, and are used for the construction of \nthe process model. A topic for further work is to investigate whether additional kinds \nof activity dependencies are required. Anothe r topic for further research is to study \nhow to include more phases in the process models, in addition to the negotiation and \nexecution phases. \nReferences \n1.
