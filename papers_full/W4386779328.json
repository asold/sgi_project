  "abstract": "As the number of modalities in biomedical data continues to increase, the significance of multi-modal data becomes evident in capturing complex relationships between biological processes, thereby complementing disease classification. However, the current multi-modal fusion methods for biomedical data require more effective exploitation of intra- and inter-modal interactions, and the application of powerful fusion methods to biomedical data is relatively rare. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal data fusion method that addresses these limitations. Our proposed method utilizes a graph neural network and a 3D convolutional network to identify intra-modal relationships. By doing so, we can extract meaningful features from each modality, preserving crucial information. To fuse information from different modalities, we employ the Low-rank Multi-modal Fusion method, which effectively integrates multiple modalities while reducing noise and redundancy. Additionally, our method incorporates the Cross-modal Transformer to automatically learn relationships between different modalities, facilitating enhanced information exchange and representation. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed method using lung CT imaging data and physiological and biochemical data obtained from patients diagnosed with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Our method demonstrates superior performance compared to various fusion methods and their variants in terms of disease classification accuracy.",
