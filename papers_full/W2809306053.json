  "abstract": "A new type of electronic voltage transformer is proposed in this study for big data background. By using the conventional inverted SF_6 transformer insulation structure, a coaxial capacitor sensor was constructed by designing a middle coaxial electrode between the high-voltage electrode and the ground electrode. The measurement of the voltage signal could be obtained by detecting the capacitance current i of the SF_6 coaxial capacitor. To improve the accuracy of the integrator, a high-precision digital integrator based on the Romberg algorithm is proposed in this study. This can not only guarantee the accuracy of computation, but also reduce the consumption time; in addition, the sampling point can be reused. By adopting the double shielding effect of the high-voltage shell and the grounding metal shield, the ability and stability of the coaxial capacitor divide could be effectively improved to resist the interference of stray electric fields. The factors that affect the coaxial capacitor were studied, such as position, temperature, and pressure, which will influence the value of the coaxial capacitor. Tests were carried out to verify the performance. The results showed that the voltage transformer based on the SF_6 coaxial capacitor satisfies the requirements of the 0.2 accuracy class. This study can promote the use of new high-performance products for data transmission in the era of big data and specific test analyses.",
