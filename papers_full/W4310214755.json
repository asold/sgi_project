Search terms used were “Omicron \nepidemiology”, “Omicron emergence”, “Omicron  \nbooster”, “Omicron third dose”, “Omicron fourth \ndose”, “Omicron targeting vaccine”, “Omicron bivalent  \nvaccine”, and “Omicron multivalent vaccine”. Priority  \nwas given to published peer-reviewed articles over  \npre-prints.\nRESULTS\nEpidemiology of Omicron and subvariants\nAfter its detection in November 2021, 5,6 Omicron \nrapidly replaced Delta as the dominant circulating \nvariant worldwide. 5,7 The first Omicron outbreaks were \nby subvariant BA.1, which in various countries peaked  \naround December 2021 to February 2022. 7-9 By March \n2022, the BA.2 subvariant had displaced BA.1, 10,11 and \nwithin different regions, divergent sublineages such as \nBA2.1.1 and BA2.12.1 established themselves in France \nand the US, respectively.12,13\nIn April 2022, hybrid recombinant variants were  \ndetected. There were concerns these could become the \nnext dominant variants and combine the severity of  \nDelta infection with the transmissibility of Omicron. 14-16 \nHowever, that did not come to pass; by June 2022, new \nBA.4 and BA.5 subvariants had emerged and became \nincreasingly prevalent.17 BA.5 is presently the dominant \nsubvariant worldwide. 17 More recently, BA.2.75.2 \nand BA.4.6 have emerged and there are concerns of a  \nnew wave of infections due to their immune evasion \ncapability (Figs. 1 and 2).18,19 Also recently in Singapore, \nthere has been a sharp uptick in new cases due to the  \nOmicron hybrid subvariant XBB (Fig. 3). Such rapid \nemergence and establishment of different Omicron \nsubvariants complicate the development of variant-  \nspecific vaccines, as vaccine candidates may be  \noutdated by the time they enter clinical trials, let alone \nclinical use. \nPathological characteristics of Omicron compared  \nto Delta\nThere is currently good evidence that Omicron causes \nsignificantly less severe disease than Delta. For example,  \nin a study involving patients admitted from Paris  \nemergency departments, Omicron was independently \nassociated with better hospital outcomes compared \nto Delta, with a decrease in intensive care unit (ICU)  \nadmission by 11.4%, mechanical ventilation by 3.6%,  \nand mortality by 4.2% (differences were adjusted for the \nnumber of vaccine doses). 20 Overall, the rates of severe \ndisease with Omicron among vaccinated individuals \nare comparable to seasonal influenza, though the public  \nhealth impact has remained significant due to the \nextraordinarily high number of cases. The lower virulence \nhas been partially attributed to changes in virus receptor \nbinding that reduced Omicron’s efficiency at infecting  \ncells in the lungs and gut, but not the upper airways.21  \nThe higher number of Omicron cases can be attributed \nto the higher transmissibility and infectivity compared to \nprevious variants, with an effective reproduction number  \nof 4.20 (BA.1/2), which is triple that of Delta. 22 Viral  \nfactors such as increased angiotensin-converting  \nenzyme-2 receptor affinity might contribute to this  \nincreased transmissibility. 21 Furthermore, Omicron \nis effective at evading host immunity and can infect  \nvaccinated individuals (vaccine escape) or recovered \nindividuals infected with non-Omicron variant (re-\ninfection). 3,23 As the average healthcare burden per  \ninfected individual is reduced, many countries in the  \nmidst of re-opening borders and stepping down public  \nhealth measures continued to do so. 24 These policy shifts  \nalso facilitated rapid transmission of the Omicron \nsubvariants.\nAnn Acad Med Singap V ol 51 No 11 November 2022 | annals.edu.sg\nThe Omicron-transformer—Travis Ren Teen Chia et al.\n713\nFig. 1. Variation in receptor-binding domain of COVID-19 spike glycoprotein.\nReceptor-binding domains (residues 331 to 524) of COVID-19 spike glycoprotein sequences from the National Center for  \nBiotechnology Information, US data package (accessed 4 August 2022) were separated into non-Omicron (A) and Omicron (B) for  \nanalysis (extracted by searching for the variant name and Pango lineage). Sequences without a complete receptor-binding domain \nwere excluded from the analysis. Black letters represent original wildtype sequence while red letters represent mutations. (A) Inter-\nvariant variation in receptor-binding domain across wildtype, Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta are highlighted in red (total positions \nwith inter-variant variation: 5). (B) Intra-variant variation in receptor-binding domain across Omicron subvariants are highlighted \nin red (total positions with intra-variant variation: 10). In total, 31 wildtype, 37 Alpha, 5 Beta, 6 Gamma and 10 Delta sequences  \nwere analysed for non-Omicron (total 89) while 3 BA.1, 1 BA.4 and 2 BA.5 sequences were analysed for Omicron (total 6). Y-axis represents \nthe percentage of sequences analysed that possessed a particular amino acid residue at that position. There is greater intra-variant variation \nin the receptor-binding domain of the spike glycoprotein of Omicron than inter-variant variation in non-Omicron variants despite analysing \nfar fewer Omicron sequences than non-Omicron.\nThe Omicron-transformer—Travis Ren Teen Chia et al.\nAnn Acad Med Singap V ol 51 No 11 November 2022 | annals.edu.sg\n714\nFig. 3.

Phylogeny of the spike glycoprotein of COVID-19 variants of concern. How the various COVID-19 variants of concern are  \nrelated to each other based on data from NextStrain.\nImmune evasion potential of more recent Omicron \nsubvariants\nCurrent epidemiological evidence indicates that BA.4  \nand BA.5 exhibit higher transmissibility compared  \nto BA.1 and BA.2. 6,8,25 This may be due to BA.4 and \nBA.5 evading neutralising antibodies induced by \nBA.1 infection, resulting in an increased risk of re-\ninfection.26-28 Vaccinated persons with previous SARS-\nCoV-1 infection (the causative agent of the 2002–2004 \nsevere acute respiratory syndrome epidemic) possess \nprotective antibodies against BA.1, but these same \nantibodies conferred markedly reduced protection  \nagainst BA.2.12.1, BA.4 and BA.5. 26,27 BA.2.12.1, BA.4  \nand BA.5 also display stronger neutralisation evasion  \nof 3-dose vaccination regimens than BA.1 and BA.2. 26,27 \nSimilar to how the initial Omicron subvariants (BA.1 \nand BA.2) had increased immune escape compared to \nDelta, the new Omicron subvariants have superseded \nAnn Acad Med Singap V ol 51 No 11 November 2022 | annals.edu.sg\nThe Omicron-transformer—Travis Ren Teen Chia et al.\n715\ntheir predecessors. Given the increase in vaccination  \nand infection rates over time and thus increase in  \npositive selection pressure, it is unsurprising that new \n“successful” COVID-19 variants have stronger immune \nescape ability.\nBenefits of primary mRNA vaccine series in the  \ncontext of Omicron immune evasion\nDespite the lower severity of Omicron infection and \nits propensity to evade vaccine- and infection-induced \nimmunity, vaccination remains a cornerstone of the \nCOVID-19 public health response. For unvaccinated \nindividuals with infection-derived immunity, cellular \nimmune responses are comparable to vaccinated \nindividuals, even though humoral immunity is lower. 29-31 \nThis robust T-cell response may provide protection  \nagainst severe illness in the event of re-infection.  \nThe breadth of the immune response in unvaccinated \nindividuals infected with Omicron BA.1 is however \nnarrower than in vaccinated individuals, particularly \nagainst non-Omicron variants. 32 Unvaccinated BA.1 \nconvalescent individuals, compared to vaccinated \nindividuals, also demonstrated a greater decrease in \nneutralisation against BA.4 and BA.5 (both of which  \nare capable of evading BA.1 induced immunity). 28 As \nsuch, vaccination of Omicron-convalescent individuals \nremains beneficial.\nVaccinations are also important to minimise symptoms \nand reduce the risk of severe disease, critical illness \nand death, especially for older adults. 33,34 Long-term \nsymptoms of COVID-19 (long COVID) are also a  \nmajor public health concern. A UK study found that \nvaccination sharply reduces the probability of long  \nCOVID even after 6 months post-second dose (0.24  \nto 0.5 time as likely to get long COVID) 35 in spite of  \na likely significant antibody titre decay. 36-39 \nDecay in circulating antibody titres after vaccination \nor infection is inevitable. However, it is important \nto consider other facets of the immune system. \nFirstly, cellular immunity is likely to be important for  \nprotection against severe disease (but is more complex \nto measure than antibody levels). Secondly, mucosal \nimmune response following infection may offer  \nadditional protection against re-infection but may not \ncorrelate with systemic measures of immunity. 40-42   \nFinally, both humoral and cellular immune memory are \nlikely to be long-lasting. Studies have demonstrated  \nthat the 2-dose primary series of mRNA vaccines  \ncontinue to offer >70% protection against hospitalisa-\ntion, severe illness and death even if the last dose was \nadministered more than 6 months prior to breakthrough \ninfection. 43,44 Protection against severe disease lasts \nsignificantly longer and decays at a slower rate compared  \nto protection against infection. 36,45,46  Collectively, \ncompleting the primary vaccination series provides \nsignificant benefits despite Omicron’s lower mortality \nand higher immune evasion ability. \nRole of the first booster\nRepeated antigen exposures through vaccination \nand infection result in immune response maturation. \nSeven months after the second dose, Omicron variant  \nneutralising antibodies were only detected at significant \nlevels in 55% of patients, and were markedly lower  \namong older adults and men. 37,39 The first booster after  \na 2-dose primary mRNA series significantly boosts \ncirculating antibody levels, and induces a more \neffective response against Omicron, when compared to \nno booster. 37,47-51 In a clinical trial of mRNA boosters,  \nOmicron neutralisation (measured by a multiplex  \nsurrogate virus neutralisation test) increased from  \n26.2% to 82.5% 28 days after homologous boosting \n(28.6% to 84.2% for heterologous boosting), 39 even  \nthough neutralisation activity elicited against Omicron is \nstill comparatively lower than that against the ancestral  \nand Delta variants. 48,52-54  Whether boosting with a \nheterologous vaccine to the primary series offers  \nsignificant additional benefits remains unclear.38,39,49,50\nThe mRNA vaccines are effective at inducing cellular \nimmunity, and mRNA boosters significantly increase \nthe number of virus-specific memory B- and T-cells. 38  \nThis increase in both humoral and cellular immunity  \nby the first booster may account for the 90% lower \nmortality rate in people who received the booster. 55  \nAs such, the evidence for the benefits of the first booster \nis highly compelling for all individuals.\nEvidence for the second booster\nThe role of second boosters on the other hand is more \ncomplicated. An in vitro study showed that the second \nmRNA booster dose induces broadly neutralising \nantibodies (bNAbs) that are effective against BA.1,  \nBA.1.1, BA.2 and BA.3 Omicron subvariants. 56 A \nUK clinical trial, COV-BOOST, demonstrated similar \nfindings; the second mRNA booster significantly  \nincreases both cellular and humoral immunity to a level \nthat is equal to or exceeds the first mRNA booster and \nis well-tolerated. 57 However, there was also evidence  \nof limited additional boost from the second booster  \nwhen pre-booster immunity is already high. This was \nparticularly evident among individuals with prior  \ninfection. Crucially, this is not “immune exhaustion” \nThe Omicron-transformer—Travis Ren Teen Chia et al.\nAnn Acad Med Singap V ol 51 No 11 November 2022 | annals.edu.sg\n716\n(where pre-existing low immunity cannot be increased \ndue to prior vaccinations) but rather an “immune  \nceiling” (a maximum limit to the extent humoral and  \ncellular immunity can be boosted). Such ceiling \neffects have also been observed in influenza wherein \nsubjects with high pre-vaccination antibody titres do \nnot experience significant increase in protection. 58 This \nalso has to be distinguished from immune tolerance \nwhere there is modulation in the immune response \nto minimise damage to the host and is also observed \nfor influenza vaccines. 59-61 Since significant boosting  \ncan still be induced in subjects with low levels of  \nprotection and no significant improvement is seen  \nwhen pre-booster immunity is already high, this is \nmore likely to be due to the ceiling effect. 57 Therefore,  \nrepeated boosters can offer significant improvement in \nprotection if timed when existing immunity has waned. \nA recent observational study in Israel showed that  \nwhile a second mRNA booster provided significant  \nincreased protection against infection by the Omicron \nvariant, this protection peaked at fourth week post-\nvaccination and waned thereafter. 45,62 Protection against \nsevere illness however, is expected to wane more  \nslowly, similar to previous studies on the first mRNA \nbooster.45 \nAnother recently published study showed that a  \nsecond booster dose of BNT162b2 vaccine offers strong \nprotection against hospitalisation (64%) and deaths \n(72%), 63 and a mild-to-moderate protection (34%)  \nagainst infection (Table 1). While this vaccine  \neffectiveness is apparently lower than previous reported \neffectiveness for the primary vaccines series (e.g. \n90% for BNT162b2 against hospitalisation or death), 64  \nchange in comparator groups should be recognised, \nwhere current comparator groups likely have background \nimmunity from prior vaccination or infection and are not \nimmunologically naive. In addition, with the extremely \nhigh community prevalence of COVID-19 during  \nOmicron waves, a substantial proportion of infected \nindividuals are hospitalised with Omicron infection  \nrather than because of it (“incidental COVID”). Finally, \nestimates of the effectiveness of boosters have to date \nrelied on observational studies, rather than randomised \nclinical trials powered to determine vaccine efficacy. \nTherefore, one must be cautious when comparing  \nvaccine efficacy/effectiveness across different studies. \nIt would also be prudent to differentiate laboratory  \nendpoints, such as neutralisation titres, from clinical \noutcomes that are arguably more meaningful.\nRepeated boosters however may incur socioeconomic \ncosts that need to be weighed against potential benefits \nwhen deciding the frequency of boosters. For young \nand healthy individuals, the benefits of a second booster  \nmay be marginal as demonstrated by a healthcare worker \nstudy in Israel where vaccine effectiveness against \nsymptomatic diseases was only 31–43%.65\nFor older adults, vaccination and boosters consistently \nprovide significant protection. 33,34 Data from the US  \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention currently \nindicate that in June 2022, a second booster for people  \nover 50 years old decreases risk of COVID-19 mortality  \nby a factor of 3 compared to those with a single booster.66  \nThis is corroborated by a study from Arbel et al., \ndemonstrating a substantial reduction in hospitalisation \nand deaths among people aged 60 and older who have \nreceived 2 boosters compared to those who have only \nreceived one. 67 One possible reason why older adults  \ngain more from repeated boosters is the “immune  \nceiling” effect as previously discussed, coupled with the \nobserved trend that protection in older adults tends to  \nwane faster.68 As such, the evidence for second boosters  \nfor older adults is stronger compared to the younger \npopulation.\nOverall, current evidence for vaccination including \nboosters of the vulnerable population is strong.  \nNonetheless, any public health policy on vaccination \nshould factor in predicted levels of community cases, \ngiven that such protection wanes over time, and monitor \nclosely changes in pathogenicity and virulence of  \ndominant circulating strains. Given the lower virulence \nof circulating Omicron subvariants, mandatory repeated \nvaccinations of non-vulnerable populations are not  \nsupported by currently available evidence. \nOmicron-targeting vaccine strategies\nMuch work is currently being conducted to develop \nan Omicron-targeting vaccine. A booster matched to \nOmicron spike protein successfully boosted rhesus \nmacaques after completion of the 2-dose primary  \nvaccine regimen (Table 2). 69 However, other Omicron-\ntargeted vaccine strategies have been less successful;  \nthese vaccines induced neutralising antibodies in mice \nspecific to Omicron but few-to-none against other \nvariants. 70-73 This corresponds with another study of \nunvaccinated BA.1 convalescent individuals, wherein  \nthe neutralising antibodies demonstrated lower cross-\nreactivity against non-Omicron variants and Omicron  \nBA.2, when compared to vaccinated individuals. 32 \nInterestingly, vaccines targeting Delta-induced neutralising \nantibodies were active against all variants tested in mice70,71 \n(Table 2). Collectively, these studies suggest Omicron-\ntargeting vaccine strategies may be challenging. \nAnn Acad Med Singap V ol 51 No 11 November 2022 | annals.edu.sg\nThe Omicron-transformer—Travis Ren Teen Chia et al.\n717\nTable 1.

For example,  \na trivalent vaccine developed by combining the  \nSinopharm HB02 antigen, and Delta- and Omicron-\ntargeting antigens, could induce bNABs in mice against \nall variants tested including HB02, Beta, Delta and \nOmicron.74 Likewise, another trivalent vaccine targeting \nancestral, Beta and Delta spike proteins induced the \nproduction of bNABs in mice against all COVID-19 \nvariants tested.75 The vaccine candidates most advanced  \nin the development pathway are from Moderna and \nPfizer-BioNTech.\nAs part of the ongoing COVE clinical trial  \n(NCT04927065), Moderna has been developing bivalent \nvaccines targeting various COVID-19 variants. Their \nbivalent vaccine combining the currently approved \nmRNA-1273 vaccine antigen with an Omicron BA.1-\ntargeting antigen induced high titres of bNABs against  \nall COVID-19 variants and Omicron subvariants tested \n(BA.4/BA.5). 76 Interestingly, their bivalent vaccine \nutilising Beta-targeting antigen instead of Omicron \nalso showed similar effectiveness. 77 Both vaccines  \nhave similar safety profiles as the currently approved \nModerna vaccine. 76,77 \nPfizer/BioNTech has also been able to develop their \nversion of a bivalent vaccine that targets the ancestral  \nvariant and BA.4/BA.5; 78 it was reported to successfully \nneutralise all strains including various Omicron  \nsubvariants (BA.1, BA.2, BA.2.12.1, and BA.4/5).  \nAnother bivalent vaccine targeting the ancestral strain  \nand BA.1, administered as a 2-dose primary series in  \nmice, also successfully neutralised all strains tested. \nHowever, when used as a first booster, the neutralisation \nactivity was reduced against BA.4 and BA.5. Given \ntheir success in animal models, it is unsurprising that \nboth Moderna and Pfizer’s bivalent vaccines have been  \napproved in some countries under emergency use. As  \nmore countries around the world authorise the use of  \nthese next-generation vaccines, it is hoped that  \nsubsequent broader protection can reduce the pool \nThe Omicron-transformer—Travis Ren Teen Chia et al.\nAnn Acad Med Singap V ol 51 No 11 November 2022 | annals.edu.sg\n718\nTable 2.

The following statements reflect the  \nauthors’ opinion and are in line with the Singapore  \nMinistry of Health guidance:\n1. Unvaccinated individuals should be vaccinated with \nany of the available licensed COVID-19 vaccines, \nregardless of COVID-19 infection history.\n2. For individuals fully vaccinated with the primary  \nseries and first booster, who have no history of \nCOVID-19, a second booster should be offered \nbased on the individual’s risk of severe illness.  \nRisk factors include older age or comorbid  \nconditions including diabetes, hypertension,  \nchronic heart or lung disease, and active cancer. In  \nthis uninfected group, administration of bivalent \nvaccines that include an Omicron component (of \nwhichever subvariant) is preferable. For individuals \nassessed to be at low risk, there is likely to be \nlimited benefit from an early second booster.  \nAnnual vaccination (similar to influenza) may \nbe optimal to re-boost the immune system after  \nantibody waning.\n3. For fully vaccinated individuals (both the primary  \nseries and first booster) who have a history of  \nCOVID-19 in the past year, protection against \nsevere illness due to Omicron is likely to be high. \nIn this population, early booster doses are unlikely \nto offer significant benefit, except in high-risk \nindividuals, including older adults and those with \nimmunocompromising conditions. The frequency of \nrepeated boosters that will be required is uncertain. \nAgain, annual vaccination may be beneficial, but in \nlow-risk individuals, the immune effects of infection \nshould not be ignored, and re-vaccinating one year  \nfrom either last vaccine dose or infection is  \nreasonable. This suggestion may evolve if new  \nvariants emerge with different virulence or immune \nevasion characteristics.\nCONCLUSION\nWith high levels of “hybrid” immunity from vaccination  \nand/or prior infection among much of the world’s  \npopulation, rates of severe illness and death are expected  \nto continue to decline. Nevertheless, maintaining high  \nlevels of population immunity through vaccination  \nremains a key tool for moderating the effects of the  \npandemic. Current vaccine candidates that are most  \nadvanced in clinical trials (and approved in some  \ncountries like Singapore) are bivalent and multivalent \nvaccines targeting more than one variant at once, 70,74-77  \nand these are hoped to offer broader and sustained  \nprotection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. As the \nCOVID-19 pandemic transitions to endemicity, 85 it is \nimportant that vaccine formulations as well as public \nhealth policy continue to adapt and evolve with the  \nvirus to reduce morbidity, mortality and the public  \nhealth burden of this disease.\nDisclosure\nDr Barnaby Young reports personal fees from AstraZeneca, Gilead,  \nRoche and Novacyt outside the scope of this work.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank Dr Poh Xuan Ying for providing useful advice  \nfor the article.\nREFERENCES\n1.
