  "abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a recognized risk factor for malnutrition. The European Respiratory Society (ERS) statement included nutritional status assessment and dietary intervention as essential components of comprehensive management in subjects with COPD. According to the GLIM algorithm, the first step in diagnosing malnutrition is risk screening with a validated tool. Our study aimed to assess the diagnostic performance of three screening tools (MNA-SF, MUST, and NRS-2002) used in the GLIM algorithm in older patients with COPD. Additionally, we evaluated the agreement between these tools in the diagnostics of malnutrition. We performed a cross-sectional study of 124 patients aged at least 60 years with COPD diagnosed, based on the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD). We assessed the participants’ nutritional status with the three examined screening questionnaires (MNA-SF, MUST, and NRS-2002). Regardless of their results, we performed full malnutrition diagnostics following the GLIM algorithm in all subjects. The proportion of malnourished participants varied from 18.5% for the MUST questionnaire to 27.4% for the MNA-SF and 57.3% for the NRS-2002 score. Based on the GLIM criteria, malnutrition was diagnosed in 48 subjects (38.7%). All assessed questionnaires had an unsatisfactory sensitivity against the GLIM criteria for malnutrition: it was fair (58.3%) for the MNA-SF tool and poor for the MUST and NRS-2002 questionnaires (47.9% for both questionnaires). Considering the negative health consequences of malnutrition, a full diagnostic including GLIM etiologic and phenotypic criteria should be recommended in all elderly patients with COPD, regardless of the screening results.",
