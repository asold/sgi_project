Routine assessment of welfare may be of partic-\nular importance for captive elephants. Zoo elephant welfare across North America and Europe\nhas been criticised [5–9] and in the UK, specific concerns were raised by a report on the wel-\nfare of elephants in UK zoos [10]. A review of this report by the government advisory commit-\ntee, the Zoos Forum [11], suggested that evidence of welfare improvements were needed in\norder for zoos to continue keeping elephants in captivity. Previous studies have focussed on\njudging the current welfare state of elephants [5, 10], but few studies have developed methods\nfor routine assessment of elephant welfare. Yet, objective and regular assessment of elephant\nwelfare is needed to be able to monitor and provide evidence of any improvements, as was\nmandated by the Zoos Forum and the House of Lords [11, 12].\nRoutine welfare assessment often needs to be rapid, non-invasive and should not require any\nspecialist equipment, facilities or specific training of animals. For this reason routine welfare\nassessment is often based on observations of behaviour [13–15]. Measuring welfare is challeng-\ning even without such constraints, there is no single accepted welfare measure; multiple indica-\ntors of welfare should be used to surmise if an animal is in a good or bad welfare state [16].\nWelfare indicators can nevertheless be objectively evaluated, according to how consistently they\ncan be assessed (reliability), and according to level of evidence that the measurements reflect the\nconstruct they were designed to measure (validity). Indicators should differ between animals\nwith better and worse welfare, should be repeatable, and the time frame of change should be\nknown. A fully validated welfare tool will have assessed each type of validity and reliability (see\nTable 1) against predefined thresholds [17, 18] typically across multiple studies.\nThere are a number of behavioural welfare indicators that might be used to assess the wel-\nfare of zoo elephants[19]. Stereotypies are one of those most frequently used [20]. Stereotypies\nare defined as ‘repetitive, invariant behaviour patterns with no obvious goal or function’ [21]\nand it is believed they are a way of coping with stress; however, the use of stereotypies as an\nindicator of current welfare state must be treated with caution, as there is evidence they can\npersist even after the stressor which caused their development is no longer present, so they\nmay reflect a historical rather than current welfare state [22]. Veasey [23] suggested that\nTable 1.

Qualitative behavioural assessment (QBA) has\nbeen designed to capture information on the quality of an animal’s demeanour. It has been\nshown to be useful for routine domestic animal welfare assessments [4, 24–28], and has been\nused to assess welfare in free-living African elephants [29]. Furthermore, demeanour was iden-\ntified by elephant stakeholders as a potential welfare indicator [30]. Night-time and resting\nbehaviour may also be a useful welfare indicator [31, 32]. Wild and captive elephants are\nknown to spend much of the night active [33–38]. Many captive elephants do not have access\nto their outdoor enclosure at night, and are confined to their smaller indoor enclosures [10,\n39], particularly during winter months in colder climates. Furthermore, keepers are usually\nnot present during the night time to monitor behaviour; as this unmonitored time period\noften comprises more than half of each 24 hour period, it might be particularly important to\nmeasure welfare during the hours when keepers are not present. All UK elephant-holding zoos\nnow have indoor video cameras to collect footage of their elephants overnight [40], but footage\nneeds to be reviewed and assessed in order to monitor behaviour during this time.\nThe objective of this study was to develop a routine behavioural welfare assessment tool for\nkeeper assessment of captive safari park and zoo elephants in the UK. Specifically, the aims\nwere to develop and trial a prototype welfare assessment tool for elephants, to assess the reli-\nability of the tool completed at multiple time points by multiple raters, and to assess validity of\nbehavioural indicators in the tool, by comparing each to a more in-depth, objective beha-\nvioural assessment measuring the same behavioural welfare indicators. A final aim was to per-\nform a known-groups validation by comparing scores from the tool in individuals with/\nwithout health conditions and with/without demographics associated with poor welfare in\nother studies. This work was undertaken as part of the activities of the British and Irish Associ-\nation of Zoos and Aquariums (BIAZA) Elephant Welfare Group (see: https://biaza.org.uk/\nelephant-welfare-group).\nMethods\nAnimals and housing\nA prototype tool was tested at five elephant-holding facilities in the UK. These were selected to\nrepresent a range of facilities, including safari parks and zoos; different contact systems (free\ncontact and protected contact); group sizes (4, 4, 5, 7 and 9); and levels of herd relatedness. In\ntotal the sample comprised 29 elephants (6 male, 23 female): 9 African (Loxodonta Africana)\nand 20 Asian (Elephas maximus); this represented 46% of the total UK captive elephant popu-\nlation of 63 animals. The elephants ranged from 2–44 years of age and the mean age was 22\nyears. Twelve were born in the wild, the remaining 17 were born in captivity.\nStatement of ethics\nThe study involved observational assessment of captive elephant behaviour, with no disruption\nto their behaviour or routine. The project was approved by the Ethics Committee at the Uni-\nversity of Nottingham, School of Veterinary Medicine & Science, and by the ethics committees\nof each of the five participating safari parks and zoos.\nDesign of the prototype welfare assessment tool\nIdentification of welfare indicators. Elephant behavioural welfare indicators were identi-\nfied from: 1) a rapid review of peer reviewed literature using a systematic search criteria and a\nBehavioural welfare assessmen t tool for captive elephants\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02107 83 February 6, 2019 3 / 20\ncritical appraisal tool (see [19]); 2) a review of non-peer reviewed publications on elephant wel-\nfare (see [41]); and 3) stakeholder focus groups to identify novel measures (see [30]). Inclusion\nof keepers in the focus groups meant that some of the indicators included in the tool were sug-\ngested by end users; such inclusive participation when developing welfare assessments is con-\nsidered best practice [17]. Seventy-four potential indicators of welfare were identified by the\nfocus groups, forty one were identified from the peer reviewed literature and a further seventy\neight from non-peer reviewed literature. These measures were combined into a summary list\nfor consideration by an external advisory panel, consisting of people working in zoo manage-\nment, and researchers in animal welfare and in behaviour of captive or free living elephants.\nDuplicate measures were removed as were those which were not considered behavioural mea-\nsures of welfare. A list of 76 unique behavioural measures of welfare was produced for potential\nincorporation in the tool. See Asher and colleagues (2015) for full details of the categories. A\nfull outline of tool development can be found in Appendix A in S1 Appendix, and a brief sum-\nmary in Fig 1.\nWelfare assessment tool. The list of 76 welfare indicators was then considered for inclu-\nsion in the prototype tool. Final selection of measures for inclusion was based on the strength\nof evidence of their validity or importance as welfare measures (see [19]), their feasibility and\npracticality for use by elephant keepers and the need to provide a range of measures across dif-\nferent aspects of welfare. The welfare assessment tool was designed to take no longer than 60\nminutes to complete.\nThe prototype welfare assessment tool consisted of three parts (see Appendix B in S1\nAppendix for full prototype tool):\n1. Qualitative Behaviour Assessment: Determining the valence of an animal’s emotional\nor affective state has been identified as an important aspect of welfare assessment [42–\n44]. Qualitative behavioural assessment (QBA) is a methodology which was developed to\ncapture this dimension of animal welfare through assessment of an animal’s demeanour\n[26–29]. Sixteen terms (depressed, active, fearful, indifferent, engaged, distressed, explor-\natory, social, content, relaxed, uncomfortable, agitated, tense, frustrated, wary, and play-\nful) were scored by participants on a visual analogue scale (VAS) (Table 2), completed\nfour times in the day; each scoring was based on demeanour observed during a one-min-\nute live observation. One 1-minute live observation had to take place in each of four\n2-hour time blocks: (1) 9:00–11:00 am; (2) 11:00 am– 1:00 pm; (3) 1:00 pm– 3:00 pm; and\n(4) 3:00 pm– 5:00 pm) so that observations were spread throughout one full day. A mean\nscore for each term was generated from the ratings of that term at each of the four time\npoints.\n2. Daytime behaviour Questions: Keepers were asked to score 35 questions on Likert or\nVAS (Table 3) following three days of live observations. Five-minute long observations\nwere undertaken four times per day (one 5-minute observation in each of four 2-hour\ntime blocks spread across the day as described above), and were repeated over three con-\nsecutive days. The daytime behaviour questions were scored at the end of the third day of\nlive observations. Likert scales for behavioural frequency were used where appropriate,\nwith different numbers of response options based on the expected frequency of that\nbehaviour (based on pilot data and initial keeper feedback).\n3. Night-time observations: Keepers were asked to score night time behaviour from video\nfootage using scan sampling every 30 -minutes for one night, from 21:00–09:00 (or what-\never time keepers arrived in the morning), during the three day observation period.\nBehavioural welfare assessmen t tool for captive elephants\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02107 83 February 6, 2019 4 / 20\nFig 1.

Of these measures: feed-\ning, walking, comfort, interaction with environment, social, and standing or lying with\nothers were proposed to indicate positive welfare; standing or lying alone or performing\nstereotypy were proposed to indicate negative welfare (based on[29, 40])\nWelfare assessment tool trial and subsequent development\nTo test the practicality and feasibility of use the tool was trialled at three time points by a re-\nsearcher and keeper: Trial 1) by two researchers [including EW]; Trial 2) by a single researcher\n[EW] and at least one keeper from that zoo (November–December 2014) to test inter-observer\nreliability (by both people observing the same elephants at the same time); Trial 3) by the same\nkeeper from Trial 2 at each zoo (at least three weeks after Trial 2) to test for intra-observer reliabil-\nity, as well as one additional keeper at each zoo (to assess inter-observer reliability). After the first\ntrial, the tool was modified; measures which could not be easily rated accurately were removed,\nand additional options were added in for the answers where required. The tool was then used in\nTrials 2 & 3 to gather further input from elephant keepers, and to assess the reliability and validity\nof final measures. All keepers were briefed on use of the tool prior to undertaking these trials.\nRecording equipment. Bespoke video cameras with infrared capability were used to\nmake recordings of both the indoor and outdoor enclosures, except when facilities had existing\nindoor cameras (in which case these were used for indoor footage). The cameras were high\ndefinition Hikvision IR network cameras (Model DS-2CD2632D-IS, Hikvision Europe, The\nNetherlands), customised to run from battery power (Tracksys, Nottingham, UK) and were\nmounted on pre-existing structures at each facility when possible, or on bespoke 3 meters steel\nstands (Oryx Engineering and Installation, UK), at locations which provided fullest visual cov-\nerage of the enclosures. Cameras recorded at 20FPS and had a 20m IR light range. Two addi-\ntional 40 metre, 80 degree angle IR lamps (Camsecure, Bristol, UK) were mounted on the\nstand for each camera at 90˚ relative to each other (and 45˚ to each side of the camera), to pro-\nvide wider IR coverage at night.\nReliability and validity testing. Analysis was performed to assess the validity, reliability\nand feasibility of the prototype monitoring tool, and to identify groupings of elements of the\ntool in order to reduce the number of measures being analysed. In order to analyse the accu-\nracy of representation of the welfare assessment, during Trials 1 & 2, video footage of the ele-\nphants was collected over three consecutive 24 hour periods and was scored using a detailed\nethogram (see Appendix C in S1 Appendix). Generally, all behaviours were assessed in both\ndaytime and night time footage. However, there were a few exceptions. Swimming and bathing\nTable 3.

Prox-\nimity to others (within 3 body lengths of another elephant) was only included in the daytime\nethogram, as the size of the night time enclosures may have led to a false interpretation of ele-\nphants being proximate to one another when they were just in the same enclosure. Running\nwas also included in the daytime but not the night time ethogram, as smaller night time space\noften precluded this behaviour. Daytime footage (09:00–17:00) was analysed using five minute\nscan sampling and night-time footage (18:00–08:00) was analysed using three minute scan sam-\npling for all behaviour except standing and lying rest, which were recorded continuously. Sam-\npling frequency was tested to ensure that timing of scan samplings provided an accurate\nreflection of behaviour (when it was sampled more frequently) for both daytime and night-time\nethogram observations. Five and three minute sampling, respectively, were compared to one\nminute sampling and found to sufficiently capture frequency of behaviour. The more frequent\nsampling at night reflected the sampling rate required for capturing social behaviour which was\nadditionally recorded, but is not presented here. While detailed behaviours were captured in the\nethograms, analysis of behaviours was made using the higher level behavioural categories of the\nbehaviours from the ethogram, in order to compare the results to the welfare assessment tool.\nFace validity and feasibility of the tool were assessed using keeper and expert feedback.\nInter-rater reliability was assessed by comparing scores of the researcher and the keeper on\nTrial 2 at each zoo, for each element of the tool. Test re-test reliability was assessed by compar-\ning scores by the keepers at each zoo involved in Trial 2 assessment with scores by that same\nkeeper at each zoo for Trial 3. Internal consistency and groupings of questions were identified.\nConcurrent criterion validity was tested to confirm that behavioural indicator of welfare as\nassessed by the tool did indeed measure the behaviour it was intended to measure. This was\nachieved by comparing the keeper responses to questions about reported frequency of behav-\niour in the daytime using the tool with detailed ethogram analysis of video recordings from\nTrial 2. For night-time observations the frequencies at which behavioural indicators of welfare\nwere observed from night-time observations made by keepers were compared to the propor-\ntion of observations of those same behaviours in detailed ethogram analysis of video record-\nings from Trial 2. Cut-off criteria and analysis performed for each type of reliability or validity\nwere assigned prior to analysis (see Table 4).\nWe collated data from BIAZA’s Elephant Welfare Group on: body condition score (henceforth\nBCS, noting higher, rather than lower BCS are more generally a welfare concern due to problems\nwith captive elephant obesity); foot health score; gait score; any chronic or acute health conditions\nexperienced in the previous 12 months; whether they were related to any other group members;\nthe number of inter-zoo transfers they had experienced; the elephant’s origin (i.e. captive-born or\nwild). These variables were used for known-groups criterion validity because welfare manipula-\ntion was not possible in this context. Each of these variables is related to health (BCS, foot health,\ngait score and health conditions) or has been associated with welfare in other studies: the number\nof inter-zoo transfers [7, 45], relatedness [23], and the elephant’s origin [7, 47].\nAll analysis was conducted in the statistical programme R [48] using packages stats: Blan-\ndAltmanLeh, psy, psych, polcor, lme4.0, and lmerTest.\nFinal welfare assessment tool\nIdentification of indicators. Final selection of indicators for inclusion in the welfare\nassessment tool was based on the strength of evidence of their validity as welfare indicators,\ntheir feasibility and practicality for use by elephant keepers, their accuracy as compared to\nthorough behavioural analysis and the desire to include a range of measures across different\nareas of welfare to create a more robust tool. A few questions were included for future interest\nBehavioural welfare assessmen t tool for captive elephants\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02107 83 February 6, 2019 9 / 20\nbut not analysed. These were questions on vocalisations (because stakeholders and expert\npanel believed they were reflective of welfare but there was little current evidence to support\nthis in elephants) and an overall welfare assessment score (scored on a VAS from Worst imag-\ninable and to Best imaginable for any elephant anywhere). The purpose of the overall welfare\nassessment score was to provide information on individual welfare for zoo records which may\nnot have been captured by the other aspects of the tool.\nResults\nQualitative behaviour assessment\nSome QBA terms could be combined into component groupings, but terms ‘Playful’ and\n‘Wary’ did not group easily with other terms. One component which emerged was labelled: At\nease in the environment which was comprised of higher ratings on ‘Content’ and ‘Relaxed’,\nand lower ratings of ‘Uncomfortable’, ‘Agitated’, ‘Tense’ and ‘Frustrated’. Cronbach’s alpha\nrevealed good internal reliability for this grouping component (0.90). This component was\nfound to be reliably completed on different occasions and by different raters, as were two addi-\ntional QBA terms, ‘Playful’ and ‘Wary’ (see Table 5). The QBA terms were not validated\nagainst detailed behavioural recordings, but they were analysed for known-group validity.\nUsing this analysis elephants were found to be rated as more wary if they had experienced a\nhealth problem in the previous 12 months (by 0.77±0.38, t = 2.03, P = 0.05).\nDaytime behaviour questions\nThree groupings of daytime behaviour questions were identified. The first grouping, labelled\nDependence on routine, comprised questions on: Feeding frequency (higher), Feeding at\nTable 4.

Based on proposed interpretation of the individual items, higher dependence on rou-\ntine was proposed as a negative welfare indicator. A second grouping labelled Positively\nengaging with the physical and social environment consisted of: Wallowing frequency, Inter-\nactions with the environment, and Affiliative behaviour (all higher). This grouping’s internal\nreliability, as assessed by Cronbach’s alpha, was 0.68. Based on proposed interpretation of the\nindividual items, higher positive engagement was proposed as a positive welfare indicator. A\nfinal grouping related to Activity consisted of: Walking frequency (higher) and Standing still\nfrequency (lower) and the internal reliability, as assessed by Cronbach’s alpha, was 0.82. Based\non proposed interpretation of the individual items, higher activity was proposed as a positive\nwelfare indicator.\nOut of twelve questions assessed for test-retest/intra- and inter-rater reliability, four ques-\ntions did not reach an acceptable level of reliability (see Table 5). These were Interaction with\nwater, Walking frequency, Dustbathing and Standing still frequency.\nThe majority of questions were found to be associated with the relevant behaviour observed\nin the ethogram analysis of behaviour, providing concurrent criterion validity for these ques-\ntions to confirm they are measuring the behaviour they were designed to measure (see\nTable 6). Exceptions to this were Sand rolling and Object play.\nDependence on routine (which included answers to questions on Feeding frequency, Feed-\ning at scheduled times, Waiting for scheduled events and less playing with others) was posi-\ntively associated with (worse) foot health scores (0.45 ±0.09, t = 4.84, P<0.001) and gait scores\n(0.016±0.05, t = 3.27, P = 0.003). The question on stereotypy frequency, which had a binomial\ndistribution, was associated with gait score and whether elephants were related to other mem-\nbers of the herd. Elephants were more likely to show more stereotypy if: (i) they had higher\n(worse) gait scores (OR = 1.66, CI = 1.01–2.74, P = 0.047); (ii) they were not housed with\nrelated herd members (OR = 22.97 CI = 1.53–34.37, P = 0.02).\nNight-time observations\nTen elements of the night-time observations section of the welfare tool could be assessed for\nreliability; of these, seven met the criteria for being reliable (see Table 5). Some behaviour\ntypes recorded in the night-time observations (Comfort behaviour and Interactions with the\nenvironment) were so rare that they could not be assessed for reliability. Standing rest alone,\nWalking and Social behaviour, which were recorded as part of the prototype welfare tool, were\nnot reliable between or within raters. Feeding, Standing rest with others, Lying rest (alone or\nwith others), Stereotypy and Length of the longest lying bout, could be assessed reliably.\nThe relative proportion of eight out of eight behaviour types at night assessed using the wel-\nfare tool were representative of the relative proportions of these same behaviours using\ndetailed ethogram video analysis (see Table 6).\nThe length of the longest lying bout was more likely to be shorter if elephants (i) did not\nhave any health problems (more likely to score in 1\nst\nQuartile, 5.67, CI = 1.73–18.6, P =\n<0.001); (ii) had a lower BCS (more likely to score in 1st Quartile, OR = 1.61, CI = 1.02–2.56-,\nP = 0.05); or (iii) had a higher foot score (more likely to score in 2\nnd\nQuartile OR = 1.35,\nCI = 1.82–3.30, P = 0.01 and in 1\nst\nQuartile, OR = 4.75, CI = 2.31–9.76, P<0.001).\nFinalised tool\nBased on the results from the prototype tests, a finalised Elephant Behavioural Welfare Assess-\nment Tool was developed for use by captive elephant managers (see Appendix D in S1 Appendix).\nBehavioural welfare assessmen t tool for captive elephants\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02107 83 February 6, 2019 11 / 20\nAll those elements of the tool which met the criteria for reliability and validity were included (see\nTables 5 and 6 and Table 7). The finalised tool is presented to keepers in an Excel sheet in which\nthey enter the raw data and see the final scores. Those questions which can be grouped together to\nform a single score are automatically rotated as necessary and averaged to form a single score for\neach component (Positively engaging with the physical and social environment; Dependence on\nroutine; At ease in the environment) which is then presented to the keepers as an outcome of the\ntool alongside the single scores for all other non-groupable questions.\nTable 5.

At night, agonistic behaviour and lying rest, particu-\nlarly when the lying rest occurred near others, were both measured accurately using the tool, as\nthese measures also closely matched the results from the ethological behaviour scoring. An excel\nspreadsheet with pre-designed formulae, and drop down boxes, has been designed and distributed\nto the zoos for ease of data entry and collation and interpretation of results. This will allow zoos to\nassess the impact of changes in management and husbandry, to facilitate evidence-based manage-\nment of their elephants, and is available from the authors on request.\nThe aim of this study was not dissimilar to those of the AssureWel and AWIN projects [49,\n50], both of which involved development of practical on-farm welfare assessments of farmed\nspecies. Like the current study, the AWIN project also used behaviour as a central part of their\nwelfare assessments and used stakeholder input to develop more user-friendly protocols [50].\nSimilar to the current project, AWIN also incorporated QBA in their welfare assessment for\nsome species. Unlike the current study, both AWIN and AssureWel included assessments of\nhealth and physical condition in addition to behaviour. There are other projects and protocols\ndeveloped by BIAZA’s Elephant Welfare Group (EWG) which have been designed to assess\nthese aspects of welfare [51]. Used together it is hoped that these tools will provide a more\ncomplete overview of UK zoo elephant welfare.\nA number of approaches have been suggested for assessing animal welfare, and it was possi-\nble to incorporate some, but not all, of these considerations in the newly developed tool\ndescribed here. This new tool will provide some preliminary indications of elephant prefer-\nences: in where, how and with whom they choose to spend their time, within the constraints of\ntheir environment. This may help elephant-holding facilities to identify with which, of the\nresources elephants have available, they most interact. Facilities can share best practise, how-\never, this will always be limited to what is available to elephants across different facilities, and\ntime spent interacting with resources does not always indicate preference for that resource.\nQBA was used in the tool and may have potential to capture the valence of the elephants’\nemotional state. Although we were not able to validate this, we have demonstrated that some\nQBA terms can be rated reliably by keepers and some terms are associated with physical wel-\nfare state. Further validation is needed against other measures or manipulations of emotional\nstate. Indeed, complete validation of a welfare tool is an extensive process and cannot be com-\npleted in a single study. Future work should explore potential links between behavioural scores\nmade in this tool in better and worse environments and in comparison against specific positive\nor negative welfare outcomes (e.g. health parameters, or reproductive activity).\nOne other aspect of welfare which is sometimes considered to be important is telos, which\nhas been defined as ‘nurturing and fulfilment of the animal’s nature’ [52]. Assessment of telos,\nor of natural behaviour, in captive elephants might best be accomplished through comparisons\nwith wild elephant behaviour (time budgets, physical activities, social groups) [23], although\nothers argue against this approach, favouring instead a focus on the consequences of behaviour\n[53]. This newly developed tool assesses a wide range of natural elephant behaviours seen in\nboth captive and wild elephants (including comfort behaviour, sleep, foraging, social interac-\ntions, exploratory behaviour).\nBehavioural welfare assessmen t tool for captive elephants\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02107 83 February 6, 2019 14 / 20\nProposed welfare tool elements: Elements requiring further consideration\nOverall, the sample size was sufficient to allow assessment of validity and reliability against\npre-determined criteria (without correction for multiple testing). There were a small number\nof males in the the dataset (20%), however, this is largely reflective of the UK elephant popula-\ntion where only ~25% are adult males. Whilst our sample was highly representative, covering\n49% of the UK elephant population, the numbers are still relatively small from a statistical test-\ning perspective. As a result it was not felt appropriate to correct for multiple testing, and as dif-\nferent comparisons explore different aspects of validity/reliability, the number of tests\nconducted within a single comparison were reduced to the minimum needed. Although the\nnumber of comparisons made here were extensive, this is in line with guidelines for the devel-\nopment of new psychometric tools [54], which require testing for internal consistency, crite-\nrion validity, and reliability. If correction for multiple testing had been used, wallowing\nmeasured during the daytime and stereotypy and lying near others at night-time as measured\nby the tool would have remained significantly associated with ethological measurements of\nthis same behaviour. Evidence of replication of the results with a new dataset will be tested in\nthe coming years as the tool is used over time.\nIn general, the majority of the elements tested in the prototype tool met the criteria for reli-\nability and validity, and were therefore included in the final version of the tool (see Appendix\nD in S1 Appendix). There were, however, some measures which were not reliable or not valid\nin all contexts, and further work is needed to either investigate other ways to assess those par-\nticular aspects of behaviour, or to determine the meaning or significance of variations in the\nexpression of these behaviours. There was poor agreement between reports of water interac-\ntion and object play recorded using the tool, and ethological assessments of these behaviours.\nIt is possible that this is because these behaviours occurred rarely, so the less frequent beha-\nvioural assessments made when using the tool were less likely (by chance) to occur at the right\ntime to detect the performance of such behaviour. Movement or activity levels (walking or\nstanding still) were not accurately assessed in the prototype tool and questions on these were\ntherefore removed from the final tool. Alternative methods for assessing this behaviour should\nbe sought in the future, as activity can be an important part of physical welfare [55, 56]. The\nproposed QBA term ‘depressed’ was not used reliably by different assessors and feedback by\nkeepers indicated that they found it a difficult term to use. Alternative terms such as ‘lethargic’\nor ‘apathetic’ have been suggested to capture this dimension. It is not entirely clear how to best\ncollect data on night time behaviour; a number of measures were reliable and reflected behav-\niour measured on that particular night, but did not necessarily reflect behaviour over a longer\ntime frame (such as the three nights across which the tool was validated). It may be worth\nextending the night time observations over more nights, but more would need to be known\nabout the consistency of such behaviour at night before this could be recommended.\nResults from this study suggested the interpretation of one of the behavioural indicators of\nwelfare used in the tool may need to be reconsidered. Prior to undertaking the study, it had\nbeen assumed that longer bouts of lying rest were indicative of better welfare, as an absence of\nlying rest is associated with poor welfare [57]. However, it is possible that longer, uninter-\nrupted bouts of lying rest might also be an indicator of poor welfare since in the current study,\nthis was associated with health problems, and with poorer foot and gait scores (and associated\nwith higher BCSs, suggesting that higher body weight may have contributed to these issues). In\ngeneral, the known-groups analysis conducted was not used to select measures for inclusion in\nthe tool, however this analysis provided some interesting initial results. Only four of the items\nin the tool (including one composite measure of four questions) were associated with the\nknown-groups which were health related measures or circumstances which had previously\nBehavioural welfare assessmen t tool for captive elephants\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02107 83 February 6, 2019 15 / 20\nbeen related to welfare (relatedness of herd, zoo transfers, origin). The fact that more items were\nnot associated with these variables is not unexpected due to small sample sizes, large individual\nvariance between elephants, and the known groups being related only to certain aspects of welfare\n(hence why known-groups was not a criteria for inclusion in the tool). However, it must be noted\nthat many of the items still require criterion validation from more suitable measures (e.g. ideally a\nwelfare manipulation within an individual). The items for which known-groups validation was\nsupported generally fitted expectations with regard to direction of relationships with welfare. The\nQBA component ‘wary’ was higher in elephants that had experienced a health problem in the past\n12 months; although it is important to note that keepers would have had knowledge of this and\nthis may have influenced their QBA rating. Stereotypic behaviour was higher in animals which\nwere not housed with related herd mates. More stereotypy was also associated with worse gait\nwhich could either be explained by stereotypy influencing gait, or some shared experience which\ninfluenced both gait and stereotypy. Higher ‘Dependence on routine’ was associated with poorer\nfoot and gait health. This mirrors findings in dairy cows, which show higher levels of routine (i.e.\nvisiting the same feeder and stall every day) when they are lame [58].\nThis tool was not intended to compare welfare of different elephants at different facilities; it\nwould not be appropriate to do so for a number of reasons. A number of the measures in this\ntool, including most notably stereotypies, represent an animal’s cumulative welfare state,\nrather than their current welfare. Furthermore, there are a range of individual factors, such as\nlife history, health status, age, and reproductive status among many others, which can influ-\nence the results from this welfare tool, and it is important to take these into account when\ninterpreting results. This tool has instead been designed to monitor changes in an individual\nelephant’s behavioural welfare over time, and to assess the impact of changes in management\nand husbandry. Changes in husbandry and management might include, for example, access to\na new enclosure or environmental enrichment, a new type of flooring, a new elephant added\nto the collection, or a move of an elephant to a new facility.\nConclusions\nThis study describes the development of a new elephant behavioural welfare assessment tool\ndesigned to be relatively rapid, reliable and easy to use, to facilitate regular use by elephant\nkeepers. To date the tool has been used by 11 UK and Irish facilities, and many of these facili-\nties have used it multiple times to begin to track possible changes in welfare over time. The\ntool comprises three sections: (1) Qualitative behaviour assessment, rating demeanour of the\nelephant on 12 terms, scored after four sets of 1-minute observations across one day; (2) A\nseries of questions answered after four sets of 5-minute daytime behaviour observations across\nthree days; (3) Night-time observations, consisting of reviewing overnight footage, and record-\ning behaviour using 30 minute scan sampling for one night.\nRegular use of this tool by captive elephant facilities is recommended (e.g. quarterly) to\nfacilitate assessment and monitoring of elephant welfare over time. This information can be\nused to determine the impact of any changes in husbandry and management of elephant wel-\nfare, and can help facilities to develop and adjust individual elephant welfare plans to optimise\nthe welfare for each elephant in their care.\nWe would suggest that the methodology used for this project could similarly be employed\nto develop and validate behavioural welfare assessment tools to evaluate welfare in a wide\nrange of species in a zoo or aquarium setting. This would enable a more comprehensive\napproach to monitoring the welfare of these species over time, and determine response to\nchanges in management and husbandry, to better understand the impact of management deci-\nsions and to better inform policy to support optimal zoo animal welfare.\nBehavioural welfare assessmen t tool for captive elephants\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02107 83 February 6, 2019 16 / 20\nSupporting information\nS1 Appendix.\n(DOCX)\nS1 Data.\n(XLSX)\nAcknowledgmen ts\nThe authors would like to thank the staff at all the UK elephant holding zoos for their sugges-\ntions and input in the stakeholder focus group teleconferences.
