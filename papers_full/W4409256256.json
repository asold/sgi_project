In 1994, in Salamanca, Spain, 92 governments \nand 25 organizations embraced inclusive education under the motto\"Education \nfor All\"(The Salamanca Statement and Framework for Action on Special Needs \nEducation, 2024). Article 24 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of \nPersons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) underscores the demands of those with dis-\nabilities for quality and tailored education (United Nations, 2024). The CRPD \nof 2006 champions SEND individuals’ participation and social inclusion, safe-\nguarding against societal misconduct (UNICEF(a), 2024). Nevertheless, SEND \nchildren and young people are still facing social stigma and prejudice, especially \nthose living in poverty (Servili & Bermejo et al., 2023).\nIn the last 45 years in the USA, there’s been a 45% increase in Special Educa-\ntion students—from 3.6 million in 1976–77 to 7.3 million in 2021–22 (Pendharkar \net  al., 2024). About 40% of public schools report a lack of Special Education \nteachers, while 32% of children benefit from IDEA’s learning disability support. \nAutistic children’s representation rose from 1.5% in 2000–01 to 12% in 2021–22 \n(Schaeffer et al., 2024). In 2020–21, 14% of SEND youths aged 14–21 dropped \nout and 5.4% were home-schooled. According to UNESCO, 15% of German and \n59% of Hong Kong parents view SEN students as classroom disturbances; 37% \nof Queensland’s SEN students leave regular schools (UNESCO, 2020). Globally, \n1 billion people have some form of disability, including nearly 240 million chil-\ndren (UNICEF(b), 2024). Organizations promote inclusivity, using AT (Assistive \nTechnology) or ICTs (Information and Communication Technologies) in educa-\ntion for personalized learning, communication, and cognition, enhancing SEND \nstudents’social, communicational, and problem-solving skills.\nAssistive Technologies (AT) is defined by the International Classification of \nFunctioning, Disability and Health (ICF) as\"any technology … improving the \nfunctioning of a person with a disability\", whereas the International Organiza-\ntion for Standardization (ISO) states AT is\"any product\"aimed at SEND individu-\nals for protection, advocacy, and enhancing quality (Borg et al., 2015). SEN stu-\ndents should achieve social and emotional fulfillment in class, attaining parity \nin competencies (Black-Hawkins et al., 2017). Mapping the difficulties a student \nmay face, whether is a SEN student is not, as they are depicted in Fig.  1, show \nthe challenges that ATs can potentially overcome. Newly emergent or established \ntechnologies, such as LLMs and VR or AR in the forms of ATs may ensure inclu-\nsion of all students within the classroom. This heterogeneity with the class con-\nsists of typically developed children, SEN students (Autism Spectrum Disorder, \nDown Syndrome and more), student with disabilities (motor or visual impair -\nments, asthma, heart disease and more), immigrants, as indeed all these children \nare called to function and interact as a unity, ensuring inclusion is established, \nthrough the aid of ATs.\n19143\nEducation and Information Technologies (2025) 30:19141–19181 \nAs a means of interaction, LLMs, often called the’Big Bang’phenomenon in \nAI and NLP, have captivated the scientific community (Kalyan, 2024; Liu et al., \n2023a). AI enables systems to perform tasks requiring human intelligence, while \nNLP allows computers to understand and generate human language. Together, \nthey empower LLMs to revolutionize language-based interactions. Figure  2 illus-\ntrates the brief historical evolution of LLMs, as they are sophisticated models, a \ntype of neural network composed of vast parameters and trained on a vast amount \nof unstructured data, like books, websites, texts and more (Mbakwe et al., 2023). \nTheir ability to reason, generate multilingual text, summarize, answer questions \nare their most well-established abilities (Chung et al., 2022; Li et al., 2024; Liu \net al., 2023b; Ozkaya, 2023).\nLLMs have found fertile ground for application in many scientific fields (Liu \net al., 2023a). Especially in education, which shapes future generations, learning \nand teaching strategies are affected by AI and LLMs and thus LLM-based educa-\ntional systems seem to have promising potential (Darayseh, 2023; Li et al., 2023). \nThe extensive amount of knowledge in which LLMs have been trained is an out-\nstanding asset, along with their human-like responses (Cardona et al., 2023; Li \net al., 2023). According to Li’s review paper, Mathematics (Luo & Specia, 2024), \nWriting (Fan et al., 2023), Programming (Liventsev et al., 2023), Reasoning (Ho \net al., 2022) and knowledge-based (Arefeen et al., 2023; Vu et al., 2023) are the \nmain domains of applying LLMs in the field of Education. Their integration into \nSpecial Education is particularly crucial due to the field’s complexity, requiring \nthoughtful and deliberate actions.\nFig. 1  Difficulties a child may \nface  (Source: Inspired by Garg \n(Garg & Sharma, 2020))\n\n19144 Education and Information Technologies (2025) 30:19141–19181\nAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a well-researched disorder for Scientific \nCommunity, as being technologically empowered by LLMs, various news studies \nhave emerged. Affordable software enhancing social skills, applications using object \ndetection and speech-to-text technology, LLM-based system in detecting autism, \nsupporting system for autistic children, LLM-based Therapist for ASD are notable \nof establishing inclusion using ATs (Firsanova et  al., 2022; Jafri, 2024; Mukher -\njee et  al., 2023; Pai et  al., 2024; Ren et  al., 2024). Research options seems to be \nendless in applying LLMs in Special Education, as for individuals with intellectual \ndisabilities multi-modal conversational search system or images for non-verbal com-\nmunication, are created, or Individualized Educational Support System for children \nwith developmental disorders, or generic images for communication in individuals \nwith disabilities, seems to fuel the interest of Scientific Community (Mack et  al., \n2024; Ogoshi, 2024; Roomkham et al., 2022; Saffar et al., 2024). Biases are on the \ntable, as studies are trying to uncover them toward disabled communities in LLMs \n(Gadiraju et al., 2023).\nATs in the form technological means can be found a potential representor in \nLLMs, yet other technologies should be potential candidates to co-exist. As an \nestablished educational environment, VR is also implemented, as an educational \ntool (Allcoat & von Mühlenen, 2018), serves the Common Good (Lamoureux et al., \n2023) and is thoroughly researched in fostering social. Virtual Learning Environ-\nments (VLE) and Collaborative Virtual Learning Environment (CVLE) are formed \n(Moolman et  al., 2022; Naimi-Akbar et  al., 2023), fully adapted to various disor -\nders and disabilities, such as ASD, adult Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disor -\nder (ADHD), intellectual and developmental disabilities, dyslexia and more (De \nOliveira Malaquias & Malaquias, 2017; De Vasconcelos et al., 2020; Eden, 2008, \n2014; Kotlewska & Nowicka, 2015; Lu & Schmidt, 2024; Michalski et  al., 2023; \nFig. 2  Historical evolution of \nLLMs  (Source: Inspired by \nKalyan (Kalyan et al., 2024))\n\n19145\nEducation and Information Technologies (2025) 30:19141–19181 \nPassig & Eden, 2010). Furthermore, virtual games & labs, metaverse, 3 d virtual \nlanguage learning are viable option among vast alternatives applied VR in Special \nEducation (Abrams et al., 2024; Gavronskaya et al., 2021; Kudry et al., 2023; Kurni-\nawati et al., 2019; Wasserman et al., 2019; Xie et al., 2024). Indeed, establishing an \nVLE with the aid of LLMs, as a supplementary or primary means of communication \nin Special Education may forge new dynamics for Scientific Community.\nThis review highlights the significant advancements in the application of VR, \nAR, and LLMs in Special Education. However, while these technologies are being \nimplemented individually, it remains uncertain how they could be effectively inte-\ngrated in a combined manner for SEND students. To address this uncertainty, this \nstudy focuses on the following Research Questions (RQs):\n(RQ1). How is the Scientific Community exploring the application of VR and \nAR in Special Education?\n(RQ2). How are LLMs being utilized to address the needs of students in Special \nEducation, as reflected in the literature?\n(RQ3). How can the integration of LLMs and VR create new opportunities for \nSpecial Education?\n(RQ4). How do existing studies conceptualize the success and challenges of \nusing VR and LLMs in Special Education?\n(RQ5). What SEN methodologies and practices are defined by the Scientific \nCommunity to support the implementation of VR, AR, and LLM technologies \nwithin them?\n(RQ6). What factors influence teachers’attitudes toward the inclusion of SEN stu-\ndents and their adoption of these technologies in Special Education?\n(RQ7). What are the dominant technological tools, including Immersive technol-\nogies and LLMs, that provide benefits for individuals with Special Needs based \non their specific syndrome or condition?\nGiven these pressing challenges and opportunities in the integration of modern \ntechnologies in Special Education, this study employs a deductive thematic analy -\nsis approach to systematically explore existing literature. By focusing on predefined \nthemes, the methodology aims to uncover patterns and insights aligned with the \nstudy’s research questions.\n2  Methodology\nThis paper employs the deductive thematic analysis framework developed by \nThomas and Harden (Thomas & Harden, 2008), as a methodological basis for con-\nducting a systematic review on the integration of AI, VR, and LLMs in Special \nEducation. It serves both as a methodological guide for thematic analysis and as a \nresource for synthesizing research in this field. The study aims to identify, evaluate, \nand synthesize the research questions outlined (RQ1–RQ7), identifying key themes \nand challenges to assess the current state of knowledge and propose future research \ndirections. Thematic analysis was chosen for its flexibility and systematic approach \n19146 Education and Information Technologies (2025) 30:19141–19181\nin identifying patterns and themes within the selected literature, making it particu-\nlarly suitable for understanding the complexities and recurring concepts in these \ndomains.\n2.1  Databases and timeframe\nThe literature search was conducted using three academic databases: Arxiv and Sci-\nenceDirect, because these databases aggregate articles from a wide variety of scien-\ntific journals, offering broad and diverse coverage. Their selection ensures access to \nmultidisciplinary research, enabling a comprehensive review of the topics explored \nin this study. Future research could include additional databases, such as Web of \nScience or Lens, to provide broader perspectives and further enrich the findings. The \nsearch was carried out in two phases, from December 1, 2023, to February 29, \n2024, and again from September 16, 2024, to October 8, 2024. These timeframes \nensured the inclusion of the most up-to-date and relevant studies.\n2.2  Systematic review process\nThis study employs a systematic review methodology to investigate the integration \nof AI, VR, and LLMs in Special Education. The process consisted of the following \nsteps:\nInitiation Based on Research Questions:\n1. This study explores key research questions (Q1–Q7) that guide the investigation \ninto the applications, opportunities, and challenges of VR, AR, and LLMs in Spe-\ncial Education. It also examines SEN methodologies and practices, the inclusion \nof SEND individuals, teachers’attitudes toward these technologies, and the role \nof technological tools—including immersive technologies and LLMs—tailored \nto specific syndromes and disorders.\nDefining Inclusion Criteria:\n2. To ensure the relevance and quality of the studies included in the review, the fol-\nlowing criteria were applied:\n• Language: Only studies published in English were included.\n• Source Credibility: Studies must be from established and credible aca-\ndemic sources with direct relevance to the domains of LLMs, VR, AR and \nSpecial Education.\n• Relevance to Themes: The studies must focus on the application of VR, AR, \nand LLMs in educational settings, particularly for students with special edu-\ncational needs and disabilities (SEND) and contribute meaningfully to identi-\nfying key themes.\nData Collection and Reduction:\n19147\nEducation and Information Technologies (2025) 30:19141–19181 \n3. A structured literature search was conducted using databases such as ArXiv and \nScienceDirect, employing targeted search terms. A structured set of search terms \nwas employed to capture a comprehensive range of studies related to VR, AR, and \nLLMs in Special Education, including their applications, challenges, and their \nrole in SEN methodologies and practices, teacher involvement, and technological \nsupport for individuals with specific syndromes and disorders. The search queries \nincluded:\n 1. [“Virtual Reality”] OR [“Augmented Reality”] AND [“Large Language \nModel”] IN [“Special Education”]\n 2. [“Virtual Reality”] IN [“Special Education”]\n 3.

These were systematically screened against the inclusion criteria, resulting \nin a reduced dataset of studies directly relevant to the research focus. This process \nensured that only high-quality, pertinent data was retained for further analysis.\n4. Deductive Thematic Analysis: The refined dataset was analyzed using a deduc-\ntive thematic analysis framework:\n• Line-by-Line Coding: Data from the selected studies was systematically \ncoded to extract critical insights and align them with the study’s objectives. \nThis process identified recurring patterns and key elements related to prede-\nfined themes, including the roles of VR, AR, and LLMs in Special Education, \n19148 Education and Information Technologies (2025) 30:19141–19181\nSEN methodologies and practices, teacher engagement, and syndrome-spe-\ncific technological means.\n• Development of Descriptive Themes: The systematically coded data was \ncategorized into broader descriptive themes, capturing recurring patterns and \nkey findings. These themes encompassed the role of VR/AR in skill devel-\nopment, the personalized learning opportunities facilitated by LLMs, the \nintegration of SEN methodologies and practices, teacher engagement in tech-\nnology adoption, and syndrome-specific technological applications. Addition-\nally, challenges related to accessibility, implementation, and the effectiveness \nof these technologies in special education were identified.\n• Articulation of Analytical Themes: The descriptive themes were further \nsynthesized into higher-order analytical themes, offering in-depth insights \ninto the integration of VR, AR, and LLMs in Special Education. This phase \nexamined the synergy between immersive technologies and AI in fostering \nFig. 3  The process of selecting \nscientific articles (Source: Cre-\nated by authors)\n\n19149\nEducation and Information Technologies (2025) 30:19141–19181 \ninclusive education, assessed their impact on SEN methodologies and teacher \nengagement, and proposed frameworks for effective implementation. Further-\nmore, it highlighted existing gaps in accessibility, policy frameworks, and \nteacher preparedness, emphasizing the need for structured guidelines and pro-\nfessional development to support their successful adoption.\nThis systematic approach, combining rigorous data selection with thematic analy-\nsis, provides a robust foundation for articulating the current state of knowledge. It \nenables the identification of opportunities, challenges, and future research directions \nin leveraging AI and Immersive technologies for Special Education.\n2.3  Minimizing bias\nTo ensure the reliability of the findings, two independent reviewers participated in \nthe data extraction and coding process. Discrepancies in coding and theme identi-\nfication were resolved through discussion. This approach helped minimize bias and \nincrease the credibility of the results.\n3  Findings\nThis section presents the findings derived from the systematic review and deduc-\ntive thematic analysis, focusing on Immersive Technologies and LLMs through \nrelevant studies, addressing their integration into Special Education and the chal-\nlenges associated with their implementation. Additionally, it explores SEN meth-\nodologies and practices, as well as teachers’ attitudes toward technology, and \nthe application of technological tools categorized by syndromes and disorders. \nThis approach provides a comprehensive perspective on the role of these technolo-\ngies in Special Education, as their integration is of high importance.\n3.1  VR and AR in special education\nVR has emerged as a powerful tool in Special Education, offering personalized \nlearning environments that cater to the unique needs of students with disabilities. \nBy enabling educators to modify teaching strategies, VR allows for the adaptation of \ninstructional content to align with the cognitive, sensory, and motor abilities of indi-\nvidual learners (Chiazzese et al., 2019; Luna et al., 2018; Mangina et al., 2018; Par -\nmaxi, 2023). This adaptability is particularly advantageous for students with ADHD, \nand other learning disabilities, as immersive VR environments enhance engagement, \nminimize distractions, and provide structured, interactive experiences that reinforce \nlearning concepts (Chiazzese et al., 2019; Mangina et al., 2018). Furthermore, VR \nintegrates scaffolding and multimodal feedback, allowing students to progress at \ntheir own pace while receiving real-time guidance and corrections—an essential \nfactor in fostering self-regulated learning and improving knowledge retention (Par -\nmaxi, 2023). Research also highlights the effectiveness of VR-based interventions \n19150 Education and Information Technologies (2025) 30:19141–19181\nin literacy and language learning, particularly for students with ADHD, by creating \nengaging, gamified learning experiences that sustain attention and motivation (Luna \net al., 2018). While some studies explore AR applications for students with ADHD \nand literacy interventions (Chiazzese et al., 2019; Mangina et al., 2018), VR remains \na distinct and emerging tool with promising implications for inclusive education.\nAdditionally, VR significantly contributes to accessibility in Special Education, \nempowering individuals with hearing and speech impairments. A major challenge \nfaced by these individuals is the lack of a standardized visual representation of \nSign Language (SL), which often creates barriers to social inclusion (Cheok et al., \n2019). Advances in technology, particularly in hand gesture recognition, have led \nto the development of innovative projects such as ISENSE, which visualizes sign \nlanguages to support university students (Bisio et  al., 2024). Studies focusing on \nSL integration in VR environments aim to enhance social interaction for individu-\nals with hearing and speech impairments, demonstrating the progress made in this \nfield (Aziz & Othman, 2023; Brega et al., 2014; Ghoul & Othman, 2022; Kasapakis \net al., 2023; Naglot & Kulkarni, 2016; Quandt, 2020; Raval & Gajjar, 2021; Sandler \n& Lillo-Martin, 2006; Vaitkevičius et al., 2019; Velmathi & Goyal, 2023).\nEmpowering communication skills, VR has been integrated into arts-based inter -\nventions to foster cognitive and social skills in students with special needs. The \nOpen Doors to the Arts project, for instance, creates a 360-degree VR environment \ndesigned to promote exploration and social integration among autistic students \n(Heintzelman & Fogt, 2023). Research suggests that combining VR with the arts not \nonly enhances critical thinking, concentration, and creativity but also enriches the \nlearning experience by incorporating immersive and engaging activities. Comple-\nmenting this, technologies like Kinect and 3D cameras facilitate game-based learn-\ning, further contributing to the development of motor, cognitive, and language skills \n(Allcoat & von Mühlenen, 2018; Kusumaningsih et  al., 2022; Sheehan & Katz, \n2013).\nThe extensive body of research on VR in Special Education underscores its \npotential to support SEN students in acquiring essential skills, improving social \nengagement, and developing speech and emotional intelligence (Bisio et al., 2024; \nGerhátová et al., 2014; Ghoul & Othman, 2022; Ironsi, 2023; Luca et al., 2023; Safi  \net al., 2023; Wasserman et al., 2019). Additionally, VR has proven to be particularly \neffective in adapting to diverse learning contexts, especially in STEM education, \nwhere it facilitates hands-on, interactive learning experiences (Ke et al., 2022; Moon \net al., 2020; Sokolikj et al., 2023). Motion-based games that utilize body tracking \ntechnology further enhance engagement by promoting the development of motor \ncoordination and interaction skills, which are crucial for students with disabilities \n(Kourakli et al., 2017).\nVR has firmly established itself as a transformative tool in Special Educa-\ntion, providing immersive, adaptable, and personalized learning experiences \nthat address the diverse needs of students with disabilities. As an already well-inte-\ngrated technology, VR plays a pivotal role in shaping inclusive educational envi-\nronments. Moving forward, its potential could be further amplified through inte-\ngration with emerging technologies, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), to \n19151\nEducation and Information Technologies (2025) 30:19141–19181 \nenhance personalized support, real-time communication, and adaptive learning \npathways for SEN students.\n3.2  AI and LLMs in special education\nAI benefits children with impairments across devices (Garg & Sharma, 2020). Liu’s \nreview (2012–2021) identifies AI as a key educational tool, enhancing personalized \nlearning and teaching competencies (Liu et al., 2023a). Generative AI’s uniqueness \nand sophisticated outcomes have made it a megatrend (Martin et  al., 2024; Tlili \net  al., 2023). Martin highlights ChatGPT’s significant research interest and AI in \nEducation (Castelli & Manzoni, 2022; Liu et al., 2023b), supporting critical think -\ning and enriching learning experiences (Darvishi et al., 2022; Dwivedi et al., 2023; \nEssel et  al., 2024; Kasneci et  al., 2023; Liu et  al., 2023a; Rahman & Watanobe, \n2023; Rahman & Islam et. al, 2023; Rospigliosi, 2023; Tlili et al., 2023).\nAI has made significant strides in Special Educational Needs (SEN), offering \npersonalized learning and support. AI adapts to the specific learning needs of SEN \nstudents, creating individualized pathways for instruction. Studies by Cardona and \nGarg highlight AI’s ability to provide tailored resources, helping learners overcome \nvarious challenges (Cardona et al., 2023; Garg & Sharma, 2020). Furthermore, AI \nfosters engagement and emotional support, reducing isolation and empowering stu-\ndents. AI tools also enhance the learning process through NLP, improving knowl-\nedge acquisition and assessment (Zoana et al., 2023).\nFor visually impaired learners, AI tools enhance interaction and cognition by \nadapting to user needs. AI systems designed for this purpose function as cognitive \nextensions, allowing visually impaired students to navigate their environment more \nindependently (Xie et al., 2024). However, studies have revealed biases in AI sys-\ntems, particularly chatbots, which tend to depict people with disabilities as having \nmore limitations compared to non-disabled users (Urbina et al., 2024). Addressing \nthese biases is crucial to ensure fair and inclusive AI-driven educational tools.\nIn autism, AI has proven especially useful for early diagnosis and intervention. \nAI-driven tools such as NLP and speech analytics provide quantitative insights into \nspeech and language patterns, improving diagnostic accuracy (Trayvick et al., 2024). \nAdditionally, AI models analyze behavioral and biological markers, such as eye gaze \nand MRI, to detect autism earlier and offer targeted interventions (Pandya et  al., \n2024). Speech frameworks like MT-Net leverage AI to screen for mental disabilities, \nprocessing speech data to achieve high diagnostic accuracy (Meng et al., 2022).\nAI also plays a role in behavior recognition for autistic individuals, using eye-\ntracking data and machine learning to assess behaviors and customize interven-\ntions (Jeyarani & Senthilkumar et al, 2023). Vision-based AI models like the Video \nSwin Transformer further enhance autism-related behavior recognition (Deng et al., \n2024). Robotic interventions utilizing LLMs have also been developed to assist chil-\ndren with autism, delivering dynamic, personalized content during therapy sessions \n(Mishra et al., 2024).\nIn addition to autism, AI and LLMs are being used to improve text accessibil-\nity for individuals with cognitive impairments by simplifying complex texts into \n19152 Education and Information Technologies (2025) 30:19141–19181\nEasy-to-Read formats (Martínez et  al., 2024). These advancements in AI support \na more inclusive educational environment, ensuring that learners with various dis-\nabilities have access to resources tailored to their needs. As AI continues to evolve, \naddressing biases and ensuring accessibility will be key to its successful integration \nin special education (Almufareh et al., 2024).\nThe advancement of AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) has already \nshown remarkable potential in enhancing personalized learning, accessibility, \nand inclusion in Special Education. However, their true impact can be ampli-\nfied through integration with Immersive Technologies. This convergence opens \nnew avenues for research, encouraging the scientific community to explore syn-\nergistic applications that optimize learning outcomes, foster social interac-\ntion, and address cognitive and emotional challenges. By embracing this holistic \napproach, the integration of LLMs, and Immersive Technologies has the poten-\ntial to reshape Special Education, ensuring that learners with diverse needs have \naccess to equitable, effective, and engaging learning opportunities tailored to \ntheir unique abilities.\n3.3  VR and LLMs in special education\nVR enhances ASD children’s social skills through activities like physical education \n(Mokmin & Ridzuan, 2022) and storytelling (Ke et al., 2022), while AI integrates \ninto STEM and music education (Martin et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024). Southgate \nexplores AI and VR’s impact on Science education engagement and performance \n(Southgate, 2019), a direction further investigated by Martin (Martin et al., 2024). \nAffective Computing (AfC) analyzes human emotion for educational integration \n(Ludlow, 2015), with Jurado introducing a Virtual Human (VH) mimicking human \nemotional and cognitive dynamics, featuring a range of expressions and engaging in \nconversations enhanced by GPT3 (Llanes-Jurado et  al., 2024). However, applying \nVR/AR and LLMs in Special Education lacks a clear framework, underscoring the \nneed for inclusion (Llanes-Jurado et al., 2024).\nBERT accelerates the humor abilities of Virtual Voice Assistants (VA) and VAs, \nenhancing personalized jokes and feedback but facing limitations (Annamoradnejad \n& Zoghi, 2020; Mottini & Chowdhury, 2019). It was also utilized for Intelligence \nVirtual Assistance, virtual well-being coaching, and interactive language learn-\ning, despite speech-to-text errors and limited training data (Savelieva et al., 2020; \nUppoor et al., 2022; Winata et al., 2021).\nVAs have evolved with the implementation of LLMs (GPT- 3 and GPT- 4): in \nHigher Education for personalized and adaptive systems, in mobile phones, as \nimproved learning systems, learning English, in Metaverse for virtual interactions \nand content creation (Chamola et  al., 2023; Guan et  al., 2023; Sajja et  al., 2023; \nZhou, 2023)(Chamola et al., 2023; Guan et al., 2023; Sajja et al., 2023; Zhou, 2023). \nThey also attain more advanced and complex structures, like adapting to human \ncommunication with T5 and Transformer CopyNet or thinking LLM-Based Con-\nversational VAs for providing enhanced user satisfaction, engagement and guid-\nance (Lee et  al., 2020; Park & Kulkarni, 2023). LLM-based VAs provide better \n19153\nEducation and Information Technologies (2025) 30:19141–19181 \ntechniques, the ability to adapt to user needs, and consistency. However, they give \nbiased or false answers and can’t be used on mobile devices, according to Guan’s \nstudy (Guan et al., 2023). Autonomous Visualization Agents (AVAs) are suggested \nfor forming visualized systems, yet issues with prompting and in decision-making, \nwhere options are many (Liu et  al., 2023a), are stated. Affective AI is ideal for \nunstructured dialogues, corresponding with various facial expressions. It supports \n13 languages; the data is not stored; if any misbehavior occurs, it stops. Adjust-\nments to the VA’s appearance or background, along with feedback, are possible and \nthus they can be applied in the fields of Education, Language Learning, and more \n(Abadie et  al., 2024; Hasan et  al., 2023). Adabie, presents ChatGPT as a Virtual \nRobot and educational tool for teaching and learning interactive scenarios (Abadie \net al., 2024). Academy Khan creates Khanmigo, a LLM-based VA for personalized \nlearning support and organizing lesson plans while promoting creative thinking. \nOnly English, Spanish and Portuguese are available, subscription is mandatory and \nit is accessible in limited geographical areas. Ethical considerations are also pointed \nout, especially for younger learners (Khan Academy, 2024).\nVR worlds with prompts in GPT- 3 are proposed for game development and con-\ntent creation, yet multimodal interactions have not been achieved (Roberts et  al., \n2022). Motion Prediction on Face Motion with VR and GPT- 3 occurs as facial \nexpressions and speech are adjusted to a given dialogue (Ng et  al., 2023). LLM-\nbased AR environments for cognitive skill acquisition through Foreign Language \nLearning are ideal for preschool children (Topsakal & Topsakal, 2022). An AI-ABA \n(AI-Augmented Learning and Applied Behavior Analytic) system in an LLM-based \nVirtual Environment (VE) is proposed by Ghafghazi for children with Developmen-\ntal Disorders (Ghafghazi et al., 2021). AI-based STEM Education with AR for chil-\ndren is studied by Chiu as an interactive educational tool (Chiu & Li, 2023). Ferny -\nhough suggests LLM-based VEs for IS (Inner Speech) for cognition and memory \ndevelopment, motivation, attention, adaptability to new situations and analysis of \ncomplex terms (Fernyhough & Borghi, 2023). However, complexity issues hinder \nany future advancements, as well as safety issues and misinterpretations in the inter-\naction. Human Digital Twins, with GPT- 3 and VR, form emotional and personal-\nized interactions and social engagement (Iqbal et  al., 2023). Nevertheless, it pro-\nvides minimal functionality and other issues.\nThe partnership between technology powers becomes a notable research trend, \nwith scant evidence on their integration into Special Education. There’s an evident \nabsence of specific scientific literature and frameworks in this area. Figure 4 presents \na theoretical model involving teachers, students, and parents as key stakeholders, \npositioned in outer circles. VR/AR and LLMs facilitate interactions between stu-\ndents and parents, and between students and teachers. It covers interactions among \nstudents, with or without disabilities, directly, through technology, or with teacher/\nparent support. The model only mentions\"interaction\"between teachers and parents, \nindicating uncertainty about the role of these technologies in their relationship.\n19154 Education and Information Technologies (2025) 30:19141–19181\n3.4  Challenges in applying LLMs and immersive technologies\nImmersive Technologies are in the spotlight of research, as well as LLMs set a \nprominent technology, yet there is a profound lack of scientific interest in applying \nthem to diverse groups of people (Creed et al., 2023). The Scientific Community has \nto clarify the “hows” and “whats” that these technologies can achieve. All the stake-\nholders are intrigued in determining any challenges and opportunities, yet some sig-\nnificant issues ought to be addressed:\nThe vision of Special Education, the role of AI and LLMs. Frameworks for \nconceptualizing the vision of Special education should be formed, fulfilling a learn-\ning experience for all students (Cardona et al., 2023). LLMs can potentially advo-\ncate, correct, assess, and provide any type of information to students or teachers. \nOthman states that “GPT continues to advance and evolve …… becoming more \npowerful” (Othman, 2023). While teacher instability has been noted (Section 3.6), \nLLMs offer a stable, emotionally safe environment and have the potential to mimic \nhuman emotions, as shown in studies on humor (Mottini & Chowdhury, 2019) and \nsocial emotions (Llanes-Jurado et  al., 2024). Nevertheless, LLMs imitate human \nintelligence, as their responses rely on statistical calculations. Yet, the structure of \nthe human brain is far more advanced and not yet fully understood (Cardona et al., \n2023). LLMs lack a “human understanding” of how humans interact (Birhane et al., \n2023). Furthermore, claims of the superiority of LLMs’s abilities may be exag-\ngerated, provoking false or non-existent information (Birhane et al., 2023; Chuang \net al., 2023; Ozkaya, 2023).\nTeachers as Key Drivers of Technological Advancement. Cardona suggests \nthat learning can be enhanced by AI, yet unqualified or biased teachers undermine \nany attempt to incorporate of these technologies (Cardona et al., 2023). It is of high \nFig. 4  Interactions among \nstakeholders in applying VR \nand LLMs in Special Education \n(Source: Created by authors)\n\n19155\nEducation and Information Technologies (2025) 30:19141–19181 \nsignificance to determine whether SEN Teachers can become agents of obsolescence \nor prosperity in adopting Immersive technologies within the classroom (Haddon \n2021; Rahman & Watanobe et al., 2023). Allen proposes the use of VR simulations \nin which SEN teachers practice teaching basic literacy skills to a virtual student ava-\ntar (Allen & Stecker, 2023).\nLLMs as VAS or Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) in Special Education \n(Frasson et al., 2023). LLMs support multimodal forms of interaction, like images, \naudio, text-to-speech, and more (Kamath et al., 2024). These types of communica-\ntion may allow people with disabilities to express themselves and be advocated in \nthe learning process. Furthermore, Feedback is the key element in the identification \nof the educational demands and achievements of each student (Mousavinasab et al., \n2021).\nGovernment’s policies and its role in forming a protection net in applying \nLLMs and VR. The government’s role as a significant stakeholder should adopt \nlegal, effective policies, that should form a stable framework for applying LLMs \nbased on the well-being of children (Cardona et al., 2023; Rodrigues et al., 2015; \nRodriguez et al., 2024). It’s also the prime net of protection for the participants in \nVEs, as any leak of information should be avoided, as crucial data is exposed to the \npublic (Cao et al., 2024).\nLLMs have no valid framework for application in the field of Special Educa-\ntion. Education is a field that should be handled with caution in conjunction with \nLLMs, and Special Education (Liu et  al., 2023b). Best practices, guidelines and \nproper frameworks should be formed.\nLLMs, VAs, cyber bulling and cyber security. LLMs are employed to detect \ncyber bullying, yet their effectiveness remain underexplored in current research \n(Hedderich et  al., 2024; Ogunleye & Dharmaraj, 2023). They are vulnerable to \nmanipulation by hackers and cyberattacks, which can distort their responses, leading \nto discomfort, chaos, and a loss of trust (Chan et al., 2024). Furthermore, VAs raise \nissues of cyber security (Kalhor & Das, 2023), by a lack of privacy or protection \npolicies, which should be taken into account by Scientific Community. Zero Trust, a \nnovel approach in cyber security with the motto “never trust, always verify” can be a \npotential barrier to protection (Fernandez & Brazhuk, 2024; Haddon, 2021).\nLLMs, Metaverse and addiction issues. It’s a “3D universe” (Bojic, 2022), as \npeople socialize, play and enjoy various activities. More advanced metaverse forms \nhave emerged, like “Emphatic metaverses” (Pai et al., 2023), as well as versatile edu-\ncational metaverses that can be potentially formed (Ferdousi et al., 2023). Addiction \nmay occur as it has been observed with various technological means (Bojic, 2022). \nWhen VR becomes the only means of existence and comfort for an individual, \naddictions can lead to unpredictable and potentially jeopardizing outcomes (Creed \net al., 2023). Dark Verse is also another renamed version of Metaverse, in which the \nlack of supervision and protection policies can lead to cyber-attacks, which could \npotentially cause chaos (Johri et al., 2024). Additionally, there is growing concern \nabout the impact of heavy reliance on LLMs, which could either enhance or poten-\ntially hinder students’skills, a topic that warrants further investigation (Birhane \net al., 2023).\n19156 Education and Information Technologies (2025) 30:19141–19181\nInclusive, versatile syndrome-based representations of Interaction in LLM-\nbased VEs. Individuals with divergent needs (geographical barriers, diverse cultures \nand disabilities) demand diverse approaches to the design and application of these \ntechnologies (Wehbe et  al., 2023). In particular, SEN students struggle with vari-\nous learning difficulties and personalized learning strategies are advisable (Hawke, \n2023). Furthermore, it requires further exploration whether there is a unified frame-\nwork in VR that reciprocates to the severity and disorder, as well as to the personal-\nity of SEN children (Badilla-Quintana et al., 2020; Marienko et al., 2020). Spending \na significant amount of time in a VE, SEN students may experience fatigue (Souchet \net al., 2023). Promoting “healthy” interactions and establishing easy-to-use equip-\nment is advisable for people with severe disabilities (Creed et al., 2023). Further -\nmore, various studies enhance rehabilitation in a VE as an effective perspective \n(Blandford et al., 2011).\nEmotion-Based, heterogeneous personalized VR Education. VR should be \naffective with a palette of emotions (trust, care, warmth and respect), enabling chil-\ndren to flourish mentally and emotionally (Dozio et  al., 2022). Furthermore, per -\nsonalized learning strategies may advocate SEN students’ development, yet one-to-\none interaction or individualized virtual sessions may not promote social interaction \n(Saalfeld et al., 2020), as well as heterogeneous educational needs are challenging \nfor diverse group of students within the classroom (typically developed children, \nSEN students, immigrants and more) (Gabaldón-Estevan et al., 2020).\nLLMs, VR and cost-effectiveness issues applied for Special Education. VR is \nexpensive for mass application (Arian et al., 2019), while solid design and applica-\ntion frameworks and guidelines have not been established (Farra et al., 2019; Korkut \n& Surer, 2023). Further research should shed light on any dark spots or harmful \nintentions that can negatively affect SEN students. On the contrary, LLMs can be \napplied with zero or limited cost to various devices, such as smartphones and desk -\ntops (Cardona et al., 2023), yet a unified strategy of integration should be formed.\n3.5  Special education methodologies and practices\nSEN students with mild disabilities are enrolled in mainstream classrooms and thus \npositively influenced by their classmates, as relationships are forged, beneficial for \nboth parties (Gottfried, 2014; Horoi & Ost, 2015; Huang et al., 2021; Pan & Luo, \n2023; Rangvid, 2019; Schwab, 2015). Nevertheless, SEN children on the verge \nof an emotional outbreak, disturbing the learning process (Balestra et  al., 2022; \nEgalite, 2019). Even among SEN children, there is unequal treatment, as parents \nwith ASD children report dissatisfaction with the school community, highlighting \nthe lack of qualified school staff, in comparison to DS (Down Syndrome) children, \nwho are more likely to attend regular classrooms, while receiving additional sup-\nport (Herwegen et al., 2018). ASD children and people with various disorders expe-\nrience self-isolation (Bossaert et al., 2012), as well as self-destruction and mental \nissues (O’Hagan et al., 2021). ASD people can meet educational goals, especially at \nupper educational levels (Goodall, 2018), yet Home education is advocated in many \ncountries, as in the USA 2.5 million children are learning at home (Ray, 2024). It’s \n19157\nEducation and Information Technologies (2025) 30:19141–19181 \nsupported by parents of children with ASD, as the mainstream classroom deems any \neffort to include these people (O’Hagan et al., 2021). This general dissatisfaction, \nparticularly among SEN students and their family needs to be properly addressed, \nhighlighting a significant challenge. In response, the integration and further testing \nof technological solutions could play a pivotal role in addressing these concerns.\nSpecial Education involves various methodologies, as the Scientific Community \nsuggests. Through experimentation, SEN students are actively engaged in the learn-\ning process (Gerhátová, 2014), as well as with sensor-based games (Kourakli et al., \n2017). Rachmawati proposes DI (Differentiated Instruction) as an educational learn-\ning strategy for Special Education (Rachmawati et al., 2016). ILP (Individual Learn-\ning Plan) is set up to meet the unique educational needs of each student and those \nstruggling with various cognitive, emotional, or mental deficiencies, are in greater \nneed of effective learning interventions. Activities should be inspired by real life. \nThis is an approach to how the theory of Socio-Constructivism occurs during the \nlearning process in special education (Voinea & Purcaru, 2015). A Pedagogy formed \nby a game-based learning strategy is also advocated (Johnson-Glenberg et al., 2014; \nKaradimitriou & Roussou, 2011), as well as curriculums and educational plans, \nwhich should also be adapted to the distinctive personality of each SEN student (Zir-\nkel & T, 2009). Evaluating these methodologies as essential tools can facilitate the \neffective implementation of VR/AR technologies and LLMs, thereby enhancing and \npersonalizing the experience of learning for SEN students, ultimately enriching their \neducational journey.\nParental involvement is encouraged in Israel, but gaps remain in improving \ninclusion policies (Orly, 2015). In comparison with Palestine, educators have the \nwillingness, yet there is a profound lack of infrastructure, as well as economic and \npolitical instability and other issues (MacKenzie et al., 2023). Russia is still in the \nprocess of forming inclusive educational environments (Valeeva, 2015). In advanced \neconomies, like Germany and Sweden inclusion seems to be applied with a diver -\ngent approach. The federal states in Germany do not have a unified policy and an \nassessment acknowledges the disorder before any action proceeds. On the contrary, \nSweden promotes inclusion for most children, provided they can reciprocate to the \nbasics. Any kid can receive assistance in the learning process, without being char -\nacterized as a student with special educational needs (Sansour & Bernhard, 2018). \nInclusion policies vary globally, as there is no unified framework, as highlighted by \nprevious studies. However, VR technologies have the potential to transcend geo-\ngraphical barriers, in which people of all nationalities and religions can connect \nremotely, utilizing LLMs as a powerful means of communication.\nTeachers play a pivotal role in fostering inclusion, yet in special education, they \nface aggression by students (Levy, 2023). EDB students stand as a challenge, as \ntheir aggression can escalate, which disrupts the learning process (Amstad & Mül-\nler, 2020; Lebrun-Harris et al., 2019; Valenti et al., 2019). Emotional disassociation \nseems to be a perspective for educators to deal in a moment of crisis (Chang, 2020). \nIt’s an “emotional state” to survive and reciprocate to their professional duties as \na SEN educators (Gilmour & Wehby, 2020; Kerr & Brown, 2016). The mental \nstrain faced by SEN teachers appears to negatively impact their emotional well-\nbeing, underscoring the need for alternatives that help maintain emotional stability \n19158 Education and Information Technologies (2025) 30:19141–19181\nthroughout the learning process. LLMs could serve as a consistent and stable means \nof communication, supporting emotional continuity and easing this burden.\n3.6  Attitudes of teachers toward special education and technology\nInclusion is highly valued, as teachers form an environment in which SEN students \nexplore and develop cognitive skills (Moberg et al., 2020; Savolainen et al., 2012; \nVoinea & Purcaru, 2015). Teachers’ Attitudes Towards Inclusion (ATI) indicate the \nfeasibility of integrating SEN students into school communities (Ai et  al., 2022; \nMoberg et al., 2020). Educators classroom management skills are essential, though \nexperienced teachers may exhibit negative ATI and younger teachers may face low \nself-esteem issues (Bandura, 2012; Gülsün et al., 2023). Furthermore, due to SEN \nstudents with EBD (Emotional and Behavioral Disabilities) teachers are inclined to \nabort and change schools (Gilmour & Wehby, 2020). According to O’Hagan, teach-\ners cope with SEN students unsuccessfully (O’Hagan et  al., 2021). They demon-\nstrate a deficiency in implementing practical interventions for SEN students (Web-\nster & Blatchford, 2019). Home education is a common educational practice, yet \nparents are burned out of adopting various roles in their household, along with the \nprime education of their children (Daniels et al., 2017). SEN Teachers seem to be on \nthe verge of emotional fatigue, in comparison with volunteers, who express posses-\nsiveness, while interacting with disabled people (Sagone & Caroli, 2014).\nTeachers in France are thoroughly researched toward ATI. A contradictory defini-\ntion of “selection function” acts as an assessment tool of the worthiness of each stu-\ndent to achieve learning goals. This term is also in line with the principle of medi-\nocrity, as a general means of discrimination against the abilities of SEN students \n(Khamzina et al., 2021). Educators seem to be the prime agents of instability and \nuncertainty (Krischler & Cate, 2019; Levy & Khoury-Kassabri, 2022). Various con-\nsiderations are to be raised in terms of management and inclusion of SEN students \nin a moral, warm, safe, and trusting learning environment.\nRecent research on Teacher-AI Collaboration (TAC) highlights the potential of \nLLMs to enhance teachers’capacity in various educational tasks. Teachers perceive \nLLMs as supportive tools that can assist with grading, student progress tracking, and \npersonalized learning, without replacing their critical instructional roles (Lee et al., \n2024). They appreciate AI’s ability to analyze real-time data to offer tailored educa-\ntional resources but emphasize the need for maintaining human oversight in inter -\npreting data and making instructional decisions (Owoseni et  al., 2024). Concerns \npersist around the socio-emotional aspects of teaching, as AI may struggle to handle \ncomplex emotional dynamics effectively (Xuefei et al., 2024). Furthermore, teach-\ners express a need for professional development to improve AI literacy and various \nconcerns in AI integration (Lee et al., 2024; Owoseni et al., 2024). The frameworks \nproposed for integrating LLMs into teacher training focus on automating content \ngeneration for learning objectives and offering personalized feedback, though con-\ncerns remain about the oversimplification of feedback (Barno et al., 2024; Lee et al., \n2024). Teachers advocate for collaboration with expert educators to refine AI-gener-\nated insights (Xuefei et al., 2024).\n19159\nEducation and Information Technologies (2025) 30:19141–19181 \nSimilarly, while VR, AR, and MR have been highlighted for improving student \nengagement and motor skills, teachers emphasize the need for more professional \ndevelopment to ensure these tools are integrated successfully into curricula (Pérez-\nMuñoz et al., 2024). Teachers acknowledge the potential of the Metaverse to cre-\nate inclusive, engaging learning environments, yet there is a critical gap in research \nfocused on how these technologies can serve SEND students effectively (Tlili et al., \n2022). Additionally, concerns about accessibility within the metaverse, especially \nregarding learners with disabilities, remain a significant barrier. The need for inclu-\nsive learning designs that benefit all students is echoed by educators, who are seek -\ning better tools and resources to ensure equitable access to these immersive tech-\nnologies (Zhang et al., 2022).\n3.7  Technological means for people with special needs: Customized applications \nand devices\nDesigning an educational system for people with special needs using AI and immer-\nsive technologies is a significant and sensitive task. Here are several considerations \nbased on various special needs:\n 1. Visual Impairments: Considerations for individuals with blindness or severe \nvision impairments should encompass a range of assistive technologies, includ-\ning text-to-speech software, smart glasses (Mukhiddinov & Cho, 2021), screen \nreaders, and Braille displays (Hori & Okada, 2017). Immersive technologies \nneed to be adaptable, providing audio descriptions for visual content to ensure \ninclusivity (Afonso-Jaco & Katz, 2022). Those with low vision can benefit \nfrom features like high contrast, large text, and voice commands. AI-powered \nand GPS-based applications play a vital role in helping individuals recognize \nobjects and people, navigate different environments, and advocate social engage-\nment (Sameer et al., 2024). Additionally, haptic devices (Papadopoulos et al., \n2015) and wearable technology (Leong & Lim, 2022), offer valuable options \nfor enhancing accessibility and independence for these individuals.\n 2. Hearing Impairments: Visual or vibrating alerts can replace auditory signals \n(Dim et al., 2022), while closed captioning and sign language interpretation \nshould be integrated into video content (Suo et al., 2024). AI-driven lip-reading \ntechnologies could also be a novel addition (Rajab & Hashim, 2023). Moreover, \nsound amplifiers, cochlear implants (Essaid et al., 2024; Eden & Leibovitz-\nGanon, 2022), telecoil systems are established technologies in conjunction with \nAI that can be of great value asset to them.\n 3. Cognitive Disabilities: Individuals with cognitive disabilities might benefit \nfrom a simplified interface and content, with clear and concise instructions. \nImmersive technologies can be used to create predictable and less distracting \nenvironments (Wenk et al., 2023). AI can be used to adapt learning content to \nthe user’s pace and understanding (Zhao et al., 2022). Indeed, the goal for these \npeople is to learn, communicate and perform daily tasks independently through \ncognitive improvement in their daily life routines.\n19160 Education and Information Technologies (2025) 30:19141–19181\n 4. Motor Disabilities: Technology should provide a diverse range of assistive \ndevices and solutions for people with motor disabilities. For those with limited \nmobility or fine motor skills, touchless input options like eye-tracking or voice \ncommands can be vital (Borges et al., 2022; Ramos et al., 2022). Adaptive hard-\nware and customizable interfaces that cater to individual mobility needs should \nbe considered (Floreani et al., 2022; Gannouni et al., 2022). AI and immersive \ntechnologies could embrace a leading role in accommodating emotional and \nmental fulfillment, abolishing any physical barrier (Creed et al., 2023).\n 5. Learning Disabilities: AI can provide personalized learning experiences tai-\nlored to the individual’s learning style and pace. Techniques like multisensory \napproaches (Gharaibeh & Dukmak, 2022), immediate feedback, and step-by-\nstep guidance can be beneficial. Immersive technology can offer practical, \nhands-on experiences in a controlled, repeatable environment (Flores-Gallegos \net al., 2022). The learning process should be accomplished in line with social \ninclusion and mental empowerment, fully adapted to the special needs of these \npeople.\n 6. Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD): ASD is a well-researched disorder in the \nfields of robotics, VR and AI. Technological means should prioritize concen-\ntration, motivation and trust through Empathetic AI (Fletcher-Watson & Bird, \n2020; Nagy, 2022), Educational Apps, Digital therapeutics (Chu et al., 2023; \nJeong et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2023) and therapeutic activities. For users on \nthe autism spectrum, customizable sensory settings (to reduce or eliminate \noverwhelming stimuli) and structured, predictable interfaces are important. \nImmersive technologies can help practice social situations or routines in a safe \nenvironment (Mosher et al., 2022).\n 7. Psychological/Emotional Disorders: For individuals with anxiety, depression, \nor PTSD, a system should provide a stress-free, comforting environment. AI-\npowered psychotherapy tools (Raile, 2024), wearable technology (Kang & Chai, \n2022) and mental health Apps promoting relaxation and reducing emotional \noverload is vital (Balcombe & Leo, 2022). Furthermore, Digital journals, VR \nTherapy (Wiebe et al., 2022), AI-based mood tracking, meditation, or analyz-\ning psychometric traits can potentially boost the mentality (Pellert et al., 2024). \nPrivacy, security, and an easy way to pause or exit the experience can help users \nfeel safe.\n 8. Speech Impairments: For users with speech difficulties, alternative communi-\ncation methods such as text-based input, the selection of pre-made phrases, or \nAI-driven predictive text can enhance interaction. AI-based logotherapeutic \napps (Raile, 2024), Voice amplifiers, are potentially innovative approaches in \nthe field of logotherapy. Non-verbal users call for extra provision with wearable \ncommunication devices, selecting words or letters with eye or muscle move-\nments (Kasapakis et al., 2022; Redondo et al., 2022).\n 9. Intellectual Disabilities: Assistive technologies for children with intellectual \ndisabilities (ID) enhance communication, cognitive skills, and inclusion, espe-\ncially with the aid of AI (Almufareh et al., 2023). Tools like Proloquo2Go \noffer non-verbal communication aids, while TouchChat HD and Choiceworks \nuse visual aids for routine understanding (Sigafoos et al., 2014). Floreo helps \n19161\nEducation and Information Technologies (2025) 30:19141–19181 \ndevelop social skills in a safe environment, and coding tools like Bee-Bot engage \nchildren in learning (Acharya & Mohbe, 2024). Cognitive apps like CogniFit \nimprove mental functions, and devices like smartwatches and text-to-speech \nsystems promote task-tracking and literacy support, fostering independence \n(Siberski et al., 2015).\n 10. Accessibility Standards and Regulations: Ensure the system meets interna-\ntional accessibility standards, such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines \n(WCAG) and is compliant with local laws and regulations regarding accessibil-\nity.\nThese findings highlight the transformative potential and the significant chal-\nlenges of integrating VR, AR, and LLMs in Special Education. The following dis-\ncussion contextualizes these insights within the broader educational landscape, \nexploring their implications for practice, policy, and future research.\n4  Discussion\nHristovska acknowledges developing practical strategies for SEN children, stating \nthat inclusion is “a continuous, integral, educational process is the way to accept-\nance, care, respect, for children with special education needs in regular schools, \npromoting socio-emotional learning where children who have different needs and \ncapabilities will enable a level of learning and tailored to their characteristics \nwhilst using different strategies of learning… School communities build open, \ncooperative, flexible, socio-emotional environments” (Hristovska & Jovanova-\nMitkovska, 2010).\nThe Ministry of National Education outlines five inclusion principles: empathy \nand respect for diverse student groups, individual curriculum adaptation, interactive \nteaching strategies —which can be greatly enhanced using VR and LLMs—, profes-\nsional collaboration, and parental involvement in the learning process (Rachmawati \net al., 2016). However, the implementation of VR and LLMs for Special Education \nis unmapped. Emotional and educational high demands of SEN students reinforce \nthe establishment of a robust and precise framework (Rapport et al., 2004).\nIn addressing the research questions posed, this study derives significant con-\nclusions regarding the application of VR, AR, and LLMs in Special Education, as \noutlined below. The findings reveal that the implementation of technological solu-\ntions in this field is inherently multidimensional, encompassing teaching environ-\nments, learning strategies, the evolving role of teachers—particularly in terms of \ntheir acceptance of these technologies—and the application of tailored technologi-\ncal tools, often designed to address specific syndromes. Highlighting these aspects \nis of paramount importance, as it empowers the effective implementation of these \ntechnologies and enhances their impact on educational outcomes for students with \nSpecial Needs.\n19162 Education and Information Technologies (2025) 30:19141–19181\nResearch Question RQ1: VR and AR in education and Special education The first \nresearch query (RQ1) explores how the scientific community investigates the use of \nVR and AR in this field. Indeed, these tools have been well-established, advocating \npersonalized learning and fostering social and emotional development. Studies con-\nfirm that immersive technologies play a vital role for Special Education, such as pro-\nject Open Doors to the Arts (Heintzelman & Fogt, 2023), the use of VR to improve \nSign Language (Cheok et al., 2019), or in STEM and arts education (Ke et al., 2022; \nParmaxi, 2023). However, challenges such as cost, accessibility, and teacher readi-\nness remain significant obstacles to broader adoption (Rahman & Watanobe, 2023; \nSouchet et al., 2023).\nResearch Question RQ2: AI and LLMs in education and special education Similarly, \nRQ2, which examines how LLMs are utilized to meet the needs of students in Spe-\ncial Education, reveals their ability to create adaptive learning experiences and sim-\nplify complex texts for cognitive impairments (Cardona et al., 2023; Martínez et al., \n2024). LLMs support behavioral recognition, early diagnosis, and therapy, particu-\nlarly for autistic students, using tools like eye-tracking and speech analytics, as well \nas robotic applications (Deng et al., 2024; Meng et al., 2022). However, biases in \nLLM outputs and the need to ensure equitable access remain critical issues (Alm-\nufareh et al., 2024). Despite these concerns, the potential for personalized learning \nand emotional support provided by LLMs positions them as valuable tools in Spe-\ncial Education.\nResearch Question RQ3: VR and LLMs in special education As discussed in RQ3, \nthe integration of VR and LLMs in Special Education holds the potential for trans-\nformative opportunities. However, there are no comprehensive studies that clearly \nintegrate VR, AR, and LLMs specifically for Special Education. While several stud-\nies explore these technologies individually or in general education contexts (Abadie \net al., 2024; Chamola et al., 2023), this study highlights a lack of unified frameworks \nor specific research addressing their combined application in Special Education for \nSEND students. Once the scientific community systematically applies these tech-\nnologies, clearer insights into the opportunities they can create—such as enhanced \ninclusion, personalized learning, and emotional support—are likely to emerge.\nResearch Question RQ4: challenges in applying LLMs and immersive technolo -\ngies The research query RQ4 examines how existing studies conceptualize the suc-\ncess and challenges of using VR and LLMs in Special Education. These technolo-\ngies present unique challenges, including the lack of clear frameworks, accessibility \nbarriers, and ethical concerns and more, as thoroughly outlined above. However, \nthe findings from the article suggest that every challenge or limitation identified has \nthe potential to be transformed into novel opportunities for innovation. The recom-\nmendations and future directions aim to spark the interest of the scientific commu-\nnity, encouraging further research into the implementation of these technological \nadvancements in SEN education to address these challenges and harness their trans-\nformative potential.\n19163\nEducation and Information Technologies (2025) 30:19141–19181 \nResearch Question RQ5: special education methodologies and practices Outlining \nthe landscape of Special Education, inclusion in mainstream classrooms is often \nregarded as the ultimate goal, as it fosters both social and academic development \n(Pan & Luo et. al, 2023; Rangvid, 2019). However, this objective is frequently \naccompanied by significant challenges, such as behavioral management difficulties \nand instances of unequal treatment among SEND students (Herwegen et al., 2018). \nFor some families, homeschooling has emerged as a viable alternative, primarily \ndue to dissatisfaction with the adequacy of mainstream education in meeting their \nchildren’s needs (Ray, 2024). Moreover, the mental health strain experienced by \neducators underscores the pressing need for supportive tools, such as Large Lan-\nguage Models (LLMs), to enhance communication, sustain emotional well-being, \nand improve the overall educational environment for SEN students (Owoseni et al., \n2024). This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the field of Spe-\ncial Education by examining methodologies and practices endorsed by the scien-\ntific community, offering valuable insights to enhance inclusion and support for stu-\ndents with SEND people. Indeed, it emphasizes the need for these technologies to be \nadapted to the prevailing circumstances depicted above.\nResearch Question RQ6: attitudes of teachers towards special education and tech-\nnology The findings highlight several challenges and opportunities related to \nteachers’negative attitudes toward inclusion (ATI), low self-esteem among younger \nteachers, and the behavioral challenges posed by SEN students with Emotional and \nBehavioral Disabilities (EBD) contribute to significant difficulties (Bandura et. al, \n2012; Gilmour & Wehby, 2020; Gülsün et al., 2023). Additionally, a lack of proper \ntraining in implementing inclusive practices and the prevalence of emotional fatigue \nexacerbate these issues (Sagone & Caroli, 2014; Webster & Blatchford, 2019).\nOn the other hand, research on Teacher-AI Collaboration (TAC) highlights \nthe potential of technologies such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI to \nenhance teachers’capabilities (Lee et  al., 2024; Owoseni et  al., 2024). Moreover, \nteachers recognize the potential of VR, AR, and MR technologies in fostering stu-\ndent engagement, although issues related to accessibility and inclusion for SEN \nstudents remain critical barriers (Pérez-Muñoz et al., 2024; Tlili et al., 2022).These \nfindings underscore the great promise that these technologies hold when effectively \nimplemented in Special Education, highlighting the importance of targeted profes-\nsional development programs and the creation of accessible, inclusive solutions to \nempower teachers.\nResearch Question RQ7: technological means for people with special needs: Custom-\nized applications and devices The prevailing technological means, as thoroughly \ndepicted above, illustrate the diverse tools and approaches already employed to \nsupport individuals with Special Needs. A syndrome-based approach emerges as \na pivotal strategy, emphasizing the need to adopt and adjust these technologies to \nthe specific requirements of learners. By leveraging the strengths of both LLMs \nand immersive technologies, Special Education can effectively address a broader \n19164 Education and Information Technologies (2025) 30:19141–19181\nspectrum of needs. This combined approach allows these tools to complement \neach other, creating educational experiences that are both personalized and interac-\ntive. Ultimately, such integration fosters a more inclusive and effective framework \nfor Special Education, ensuring equitable access and enhanced outcomes for all \nlearners.\n4.1  Limitations\nThe integration of Immersive Technologies and LLMs in Special Education offers \na transformative approach, significantly enhancing personalized learning, emo-\ntional engagement, and inclusion. Despite their immense potential, these technolo-\ngies come with inherent limitations. While several aspects, such as teachers’ lack of \ntraining, emotional strain, and accessibility barriers, have already been highlighted \nas challenges, these elements have been further delineated to provide a clearer \nand more structured perspective. Challenges address overarching systemic issues, \nwhereas limitations focus on specific practical constraints that hinder effective \nimplementation, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the obstacles in apply -\ning these technologies:\n1. Technical Barriers: Immersive technologies often demand high-end infrastruc-\nture and technical expertise. For instance, Mehrfard highlights the prohibitive \ncosts of VR systems, limiting their scalability, particularly in low-resource set-\ntings (Arian et al., 2019). Additionally, Korkut notes the absence of standardized \nframeworks, which creates inconsistency in applying these tools effectively in \neducational settings (Korkut & Surer, 2023).\n2. Privacy and Security: Data protection is a significant concern in virtual learning \nenvironments. Kalhor argues that the absence of robust cybersecurity measures \ncan expose sensitive student data, especially in immersive technologies where \nreal-time interactions are common (Kalhor & Das, 2023).\n3. Teacher Training and Readiness: While VR and LLMs show promise, their \neffectiveness heavily relies on teacher readiness. Rahman emphasizes that many \neducators lack sufficient training to utilize these technologies effectively, leaving \na gap in practical application (Rahman & Watanobe, 2023).\n4. Cognitive and Physical Fatigue: Prolonged exposure to immersive environments \ncan lead to fatigue and disengagement among students. Studies such as Souchet \nunderline the need for\"healthy interactions\"to mitigate the risk of overreliance \non VR, which may negatively impact learners’well-being (Souchet et al., 2023).\n5. Accessibility Gaps: Technologies like VR and AR often overlook the needs of \nstudents with severe disabilities. Creed highlights the challenges of designing \nuniversally accessible interfaces that cater to a diverse range of physical and \ncognitive abilities (Creed et al., 2023).\nWhile the limitations outlined above highlight key barriers to effectively adopting \nthese technologies, they also present opportunities for targeted interventions. The \n19165\nEducation and Information Technologies (2025) 30:19141–19181 \nfollowing recommendations propose actionable strategies to overcome these chal-\nlenges and foster inclusive, technology-enabled educational environments.\n4.2  Recommendations\nTo ensure the effective integration of VR, AR, and LLMs in Special Education, a \nstrategic approach is required. By adopting a structured framework, focusing on \ninclusion, teacher support, and collaboration, these technologies can address diverse \neducational needs. This ensures decisions are made sensibly and efficiently, foster -\ning inclusive, adaptive, and ethical learning environments. Some notable recommen-\ndations on the frameworks are reported below:\n 1. Inclusion and Support for All SEN Students\n• Best Practices and Guidelines: Adopt usability and accessibility principles \nto ensure SEN students receive appropriate assistance.\n• Fulfillment of Inclusion: All educational tools and methodologies must pri-\noritize full inclusion for SEN students.\n 2. Teacher Well-being and Emotional Stability\n• Support for Teachers: LLM-based tools should prioritize the well-being of \nteachers, ensuring they are emotionally stable and equipped with the neces-\nsary knowledge.\n• Emotional Advocacy: Tools must be designed to alleviate emotional crises \nthat impact classroom stability, promoting a supportive environment for both \nteachers and students.\n 3. LLM Integration in Educational Settings\n• Roles of LLMs: LLMs can act as companions, co-learners, digital twins, vir -\ntual assistants (VAs), and more.\n• Character Qualities: Any virtual character should embody morality, warmth, \nempathy, and trustworthiness to build reliable relationships with students and \nteachers.\n 4. Real-World Learning in Virtual Reality (VR)\n• Development of Pedagogies and Scenarios: Create flexible, real-world \nlearning activities and pedagogies using VR, with LLMs providing assistance \nor leading the activities.\n• Diverse Educational Themes: Incorporate a variety of educational themes, \nsuch as Arts and physical education, catering to the diverse interests of SEN \nstudents.\n• Additional Options: Offer supplementary choices to accommodate the var -\nied interests and needs of SEN students.\n 5. Data Privacy and Protection\n19166 Education and Information Technologies (2025) 30:19141–19181\n• Privacy Protocols: Ensure the establishment of robust authentication pro-\ntocols and data protection regulations to safeguard the private information \nshared by parents, instructors, and students.\n 6. Multilingual and Multimodal Interaction\n• Improved Interaction: Implement tools that are multilingual and multimodal \nto enhance the quality of interaction for diverse learners.\n 7. Global Research and Collaboration\n• Global Research Platform: Virtual environments (VEs) can serve as a \nresearch platform, enabling global interaction and collaboration among SEN \nstudents and educators.\n 8. Real-Time Interaction in Multiuser Environments\n• Enhancement of LLMs: Further develop LLMs to facilitate real-time inter -\naction between users in a multiuser setting, ensuring seamless communica-\ntion.\n 9. Clarification of VR and LLM Capabilities\n• Educational Support: Clearly define the extent to which VR and LLMs can \nassist SEN students in their educational journey and personal development.\n 10. Establishment of a Central Framework\n• Guided Values: The main framework should be grounded in social and moral \nvalues, government policies, and supported by research from the Scientific \nCommunity.\n 11. Cross-Domain Partnerships\n• Scientific Collaboration: Foster partnerships across various scientific \ndomains to establish the core principles guiding the design and implementa-\ntion of educational tools (Castro-Kemp & Samuels, 2022).\nAccessibility and trustworthiness in learning environments are essential, with \nface-to-face learning, differentiated strategies, and teamwork as inclusive edu-\ncational tools. Immersive Technologies and LLMs in Special Education raise the \ndemand for cross-sector, transdisciplinary partnerships focusing on children’s edu-\ncational needs (Castro-Kemp & Samuels, 2022; Rapport et al., 2004).\nIn addition to these immediate recommendations, there is a pressing need for \nfurther research to address unresolved challenges and to expand on the opportuni-\nties identified in this study. The following section outlines key future directions for \nadvancing this field.\n4.3  Future directions\nThe future of integrating Immersive Technologies and LLMs in Special Education \nis promising but requires focused research and innovation. By addressing existing \n19167\nEducation and Information Technologies (2025) 30:19141–19181 \ngaps and building on emerging opportunities, these technologies can transform edu-\ncational practices, making them more inclusive and adaptive. Below are some key \nfuture directions, which can potentially expand the research:\n• Strategies for Unifying Typically Developed and SEND Students: Future \nresearch should investigate strategies to achieve unity by fostering meaningful \ncollaboration and interaction between typically developed children and SEND \nstudents in inclusive environments.\n• Integration of Sensory-Friendly AI-Powered VLEs: Sensory-friendly AI-\npowered VLEs should be thoroughly researched to determine their effectiveness \nin genuinely aiding SEND students to fully interact and engage within a learning \nenvironment.\n• Development of Daily Life Skills Training Modules: Future work should \nexplore how these technologies can empower SEN students by enhancing their \nindependence and preparing them for everyday challenges.\n• Implementation of Practical Interventions: Future studies should prioritize the \ndevelopment of specific, practical interventions that translate theoretical research \ninto actionable solutions, such as tailored software, prompting tools, or immer -\nsive applications powered by LLMs, including VR/AR technologies, avatars, or \ndigital twins, to address the diverse needs of SEND students.\n• Quantitative Research and Feedback-Driven Refinements: Future research \nshould focus on gathering quantitative data to assess the impact of these technol-\nogies on teachers, parents, and SEND students, while systematically incorporat-\ning feedback from stakeholders to refine and improve educational tools, ensuring \nthey remain effective, ethical, and aligned with real-world needs.\n5  Conclusion\nVR and LLMs in Special Education as an\"effective intervention\"should be applied \nwith respect and\"warmth\"to students’ uniqueness (Humphrey et  al., 2013; Rach-\nmawati et al., 2016). Teachers embracing the call and trained in inclusive learning \nstrategies, as qualified educators could foster inclusion (Engsig & Johnstone, 2015; \nPaju et  al., 2016; Tometten et  al., 2021). General Pedagogical Knowledge (GPK) \ncreates effective classroom interactions and VR and LLMs could significantly con-\ntribute, making engagement from stakeholders, developers, and researchers vital \n(Lauermann & König, 2016). This thematic analysis provides a comprehensive \nunderstanding of the integration of VR, AR, and LLMs in special education by \nidentifying key themes across the literature. The identified themes highlight both \nthe potential benefits and challenges of using these technologies to support students \nwith special educational needs, as well as the need for a stable framework in inte-\ngrating these technologies.\nFunding Open access funding provided by HEAL-Link Greece.\n19168 Education and Information Technologies (2025) 30:19141–19181\nData Availability All data used in the study are available upon request to the corresponding author.\nDeclarations \nCompeting Interests The authors of the article declare that they have no competing financial interests or \npersonal relationships that have impacted the study reported in this paper.\nConflicts of Interest None.\nOpen Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, \nwhich permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long \nas you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative \nCommons licence, and indicate if changes were made.
