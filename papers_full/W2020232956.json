    "abstract": "Abstract One of important methods used for diagnostics of a transformer’s active part is Frequency Response Analysis (FRA). It allows to determine the mechanical condition of windings, their displacements, deformations and electric faults, as well as some problems with internal leads and connections, core and bushings. Still pending problem is interpretation of measurements results. One of approaches is application of computer modeling to simulate various failure modes and connected with them changes in FRA response. The paper presents two types of models, one based on lumped parameters with RLC elements, and one based on distributed parameters with TLM method. Both methods give similar results, comparable to real measurements of simulated coil",
