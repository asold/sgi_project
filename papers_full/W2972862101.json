Zhanget al.: Fault Diagnosis Model of Power Transformers Based on DGA Features Selection\nAccording to the research [2], the type of transformer fault\nis relative to the content ratio of feature gases as well.\nSome experts proposed that Rogers Ratio [3], IEC Ratio [4]\nand Doermenbur Ratio [5] could be used as the feature quan-\ntity to reﬂect transformer anomalies. However, Rogers Ratio\ncan just reﬂect the thermal decomposition temperature range\nonly [6], and IEC Ratio has problems such as incomplete\ncoding and excessive coding boundaries that will cause the\njudgment errors. Thus, a single gas or the content ratio of\nfeature gases cannot show the relationship between the trans-\nformer fault and gases completely, and the limitation may\naffect the accuracy of the diagnosis result [7]–[9].\nAiming at making up for the shortcomings of the existing\nDGA feature selection, in this paper, a set of optimal DGA\nfeature combinations from the set of characteristic gas and\ncharacteristic gas ratios will be screened out. There have\nbeen several methods for feature selection of data, such as\ngenetic algorithm [10], binary particle swarm algorithm [11],\nneural network [12], imperialist competitive algorithm [13],\nand tabu search [14]. Binary particle swarm algorithm is a\npopulation-based optimizer similar to GA. BPSO algorithm\nhas the strong global search ability, but it cannot converge\nto the global optimal position of particles [15]. Moreover,\nwith the iteration of the algorithm, the randomness of BPSO\nbecomes stronger, but it lacks the local search ability in\nthe later period [16], [17]. In the iterative process of the\nimperialist competitive algorithm, the number of empire is\ncontinuously reduced, resulting in a decrease in population\ndiversity, which is unfavorable for solving high-dimensional\nmulti-mode optimization problems, and the algorithm is easy\nto fall into the local optimal solution [18]. GA can handle\nlarge-scale complex data well due to its adaptability, and is\nespecially suitable for solving multi-objective optimization\nproblems [18], [19]. Therefore, genetic algorithm is used for\nfeature selection in this paper.\nIn recent years, the diagnosis method using the dissolved\ngas analysis technology in oil and the fuzzy theory [20],\nartiﬁcial neural network [21] and support vector machine [22]\nhas signiﬁcantly improved the accuracy of fault diagnosis.\nThe fuzzy theory is simple in structure and fast in diagnosis,\nbut its learning ability is insufﬁcient [23]; the artiﬁcial neu-\nral network has strong self-learning and parallel processing\nability, but it is easy to fall into local optimum [24], [25].\nCompared with other methods, SVM can solve ‘‘dimen-\nsionality disaster’’, ‘‘over-ﬁtting’’ and local minimum point\nproblems [26], [27], but the performance of SVM mainly\ndepends on its kernel function and its parameters [28], [29],\nso it needs to adopt an intelligent optimization algorithm to\nﬁnd the appropriate parameters to improve the generalization\nand robustness of the SVM [30]. Krill Herd (KH) [31], [32]\nidealizes the communication and foraging behavior of krill\ngroup. KH algorithm has excellent local and global optimiza-\ntion performance and has only one variable parameter—so\nit is efﬁcient and straightforward. Further, KH algorithm is\nhelpful in getting better convergence speed [33]–[35]. How-\never, the standard KH algorithm cannot jump out of the local\nFIGURE 1. The binary encoding of chromosomes.\nTABLE 1. Dissolved gas in oil.\noptimum in the later stage, which leads to poor solution\naccuracy. Therefore, IKH algorithm is utilized to optimize the\nparameters of SVM in this paper.\nIn this paper, the genetic algorithm is used to binary code\nthe SVM parameters and DGA feature quantities. The GA\ncombined with SVM is used to optimize the input features\nof the fault diagnosis model. The SVM parameters can be\noptimized by IKH algorithm and it is possible to build the\ntransformer fault diagnosis model based on IKH algorithm\noptimized SVM by the cross-validation principle. The fault\ndata of 150 sets of IEC TC 10 and of 117 sets in China are\nscreened. The validity and superiority of the proposed method\nare veriﬁed by the diagnosis results based on the processed\n113 sets of fault samples of IEC TC10, and using the fault\ndata in China to test the accuracy of the method again.\nII. OPTIMIZATONG OF TRANSFORMER FAULT FEATURE\nRATIO BASED ON GA AND SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE\nA. GAS FEATURE DISSOLVED IN OIL\nConsidering the advantages of characteristic gas and DGA\nratio, CH 4, C 2H6, C 2H4, C 2H2, CO, CO 2, H 2, total hydro-\ncarbon (TH) and the gas content ratios of three gas groups\n(CH4/H2, C 2H4/C2H6, and C 2H2/C2H4) are treated as the\ngas feature dissolved in oil. The speciﬁc numbers are shown\nin Table 1.\nIn order to reduce the impact of data error on diagnostic\naccuracy, 150 sets of IEC TC 10 fault data and 117 sets\nof fault data in China were screened. According to the grid\nequipment condition maintenance rules and ﬁeld experience,\nthe characteristic gases produced by overheating faults are\nmainly CH 4 and C 2H6, and the sum of the two generally\naccounts for more than 80% of the total hydrocarbon [36],\n[37]. As the temperature at the fault point increases, the pro-\nportion of C 2H6 will increase. Usually, C 2H2 is not produced\nin the event of overheating [38]. In the case of overheating\nfaults generally below 500◦, the C2H2 content will not exceed\n2% of the total hydrocarbon, while in severe overheating,\nthe maximum C 2H2 content will not exceed 6%. When the\n102804 VOLUME 7, 2019\nY. Zhanget al.: Fault Diagnosis Model of Power Transformers Based on DGA Features Selection\nTABLE 2. Attention value of dissolved gas in oil.\noverheating fault involves solid insulating materials, in addi-\ntion to producing the above gases, a large amount of CO\nand CO 2 are produces as well [39]. High-energy discharge\nfaults produce gas rapidly and large amounts of gas are\nproduced. The fault characteristic gases are mainly C 2H2 and\nH2, followed by a large number of C 2H6 and CH 4. C 2H2\ngenerally accounts for 20-70% of total hydrocarbons, H 2\naccounts for 30-90%, and in most cases, C 2H6 content is\nhigher than CH 4. Low-energy discharge faults generally have\nlow total hydrocarbon content because of the low fault energy.\nAnd the main component is H 2, followed by CH 4. When the\ndischarge energy density is increased, C 2H2 may be produced\nas well, but the proportion of C 2H2 in the total hydrocarbons\nis ordinarily less than 2%. This is also the major indicator\nof the difference between the two types of discharge faults\n[40]. Theoretically, the gas content should be less than the\nattention value under normal conditions [41]. According to\nthe regulations, the attention values of the characteristic gas\ncomponents are shown in Table 2.\nHowever, among the original fault data, some data fall\ninto a fuzzy area, and the characteristic gas concentration\nsatisﬁes a plurality of fault conditions at the same time, which\nmay cause the classiﬁcation boundary to be unclear, thereby\nleading to the lower accuracy of fault diagnosis. Therefore,\n37 sets of IEC TC 10 and 12 sets of the data from China in\nthe fuzzy area are deleted. The remaining fault samples will\nbe used for the diagnosis of the model proposed in this paper.\nB. SVM MODEL FOR TRANSFORMER FAULT DIAGNOSIS\nThe standard SVM is a typical two-class classiﬁer, and the\ntransformer fault diagnosis is a linear and inseparable multi-\nclassiﬁcation problem, so nonlinear and multi-class transfor-\nmation of SVM is needed [15].\nThe SVM nonlinear model is shown in equation (1).\nmin 8(ω,ξ) =1\n2 ∥ω∥2 +C\nl∑\ni=1\nξi\ns.t.\n{\nyi\n[\nωT ϕ(xi) +λ\n]\n≥1 −ξi\nξi ≥0, i =1,2,..., l (1)\nwhere ξi is a relaxation variable and parameter C is a penalty\nfactor.\nIts Lagrangian function is shown as follows:\nL(ω,λ,ξ,α,β ) =8(ω,ξ)\n−\nl∑\ni=1\nαi\n{\nyi[ωT ϕ(xi) +λ] −1 +ξi\n}\n−\nl∑\ni=1\nβiξi (2)\nThe decision function is:\nf (x)=sign[\nl∑\ni=1\nαiyiK (x,xi)+λ] (3)\nCommonly used kernel functions include radial basis func-\ntions (RBF), polynomial functions, etc. [16]. The RBF func-\ntion only needs to determine one parameter, so it is beneﬁcial\nto the optimization of the parameters. Therefore, RBF is used\nas the kernel function of the SVM:\nK(xi,xj) =exp(−γ\nxi −xj\n2), γ > 0 (4)\nTypical combinations are one against all (OAA), one\nagainst one (OAO), minimum output coding (MOC), etc.\n[17]. OAO has the best effect in transformer fault diagnosis,\nso this paper uses OAO method to expand the two-class SVM\ninto multi-class SVM.\nC. OPTIMIZATION OF TRANSFORMER FAULT\nFEATURE BASED ON GA\n1) CHROMOSOME CODING\nDue to the encoding and decoding operations of binary cod-\ning are simple, the genetic operations such as crossover and\nmutation are easy to implement, the chromosome of GA is\ngenerated by binary coding. Each chromosome consists of\nSVM penalty factor c, kernel parameter and DGA features.\nEach chromosome is made up of three genes. The ﬁrst two\ngenes are composed of binary codes with length of 10, rep-\nresenting SVM penalty factor c and nuclear parameters σ\nrespectively. The third gene represents the selection of DGA\nfeature quantities, with a length of 11, representing 11 kinds\nof DGA feature quantities. Among them, the coding of DGA\nfeature quantities corresponds to the ordinal order of the fea-\nture quantities in Table 1, 1 indicates that the corresponding\nDGA feature quantities have been selected, and 0 indicates\nthat the corresponding DGA feature quantities have not been\nselected.\n2) FITNESS CALCULATION\nAfter encoding the chromosome, the k-fold cross-classiﬁca-\ntion accuracy of the transformer failure training sample is\ntaken as the individual ﬁtness f :\nf (M1,M2,M3) =1\nk\nk∑\ni=1\nmi\nT\nmi ×100% (5)\nwhere M1, M2 and M3 represent the combined coding of c, σ\nand DGA features of support vector machine, respectively.\nmi represents the number of samples in the i-th veriﬁca-\ntion set when using the SVM algorithm; mi T denotes the\nnumber of correct classiﬁcations in the veriﬁcation set when\nusing SVM algorithm; k represents the number of folds for\ncross-validation and is set to 5.\nIn order to obtain the f of the chromosome, the M1, M2 and\nM3 segments need to be decoded in segments. The decimal\nnumbers obtained after decoding the M1 segment and the\nM2 segment are c and of the SVM; the selected gas ratios\nVOLUME 7, 2019 102805\nY.

In this paper, the ‘‘steady-state\nselection’’ is utilized to preserve individuals with higher\nﬁtness in the father.\n• Cross operations are used to generate new individuals.\nThe ‘‘single point crossover’’ is utilized in this paper.\n• The mutation operation is used to assist the generation of\nnew individuals, which determines the local search abil-\nity of the genetic algorithm.

TRANSFORMER FAULT DIAGNOSIS MODEL BASED\nON IMPROVED KRILL HERD (IKH) ALGORITHM\nIn the KH algorithm, each krill individual represents a poten-\ntial solution in the solution space, and the food is the optimal\nglobal solution for the KH algorithm [19].\nAs what is shown in equation (11), the location update of\nkrill individuals is determined by the combination of induced\nexercise, foraging movement, and random diffusion.\nFIGURE 3. Flowchart of the improved krill herd algorithm.\nActive and reactive currents Iai and Iri of Z can be calcu-\nlated as:\nZk =Rk +Sk +Tk (6)\nwhere Zk represents the total movement of the krill; Rk\nrepresents the guided movement; Sk represents the foraging\nmovement (i.e., the movement of each guided by the food);\nTk represents the physical random spread of each.\nA. INDUCED MOVEMENT\nInduced motion is divided into target guidance, local inﬂu-\nence, and guiding inertia:\nRk =Rmaxαk +ωr Rold\nk (7)\nwhere Rmax indicates the maximum induction velocity; ωr\nindicates the induction weight; αk indicates the direction of\ninduction.\nB. FORAGING MOVEMENT\nThe foraging movement is divided into foraging experience\nand food guidelines. The speed of foraging is deﬁned as\nfollows:\nSk =Vsβk +ωsRold\nk (8)\nwhere Vs is the maximum speed of foraging; δis the weight\nof foraging; βk is the direction of foraging.\nC. RANDOM DIFFUSION\nThe random diffusion speed is deﬁned as follows:\nTK =T max(1 −t/tmax)δ (9)\nwhere T max represents the maximum random diffusion speed,\nand δrepresents the direction of random diffusion. The speed\nof krill individual is determined by the speed of induced\nmovement, the speed of foraging movement and the speed\nof random diffusion.\ndxk\ndt =Rk +Sk +Tk (10)\n102806 VOLUME 7, 2019\nY. Zhanget al.: Fault Diagnosis Model of Power Transformers Based on DGA Features Selection\nFIGURE 4. Flowchart of IKHSVM transformer fault diagnosis model.\nFIGURE 5. The new DGA feature set.\nFIGURE 6. Evolution process of IKH.\nThe location update of Krill individual during the 1t\nperiod is expressed as follows:\nxk (t +1t) =xk (t) +1t dxk\ndt (11)\n1t =Ct\nNV∑\ni=1\n(Ui −Li) (12)\nwhere Ct represents the step size scaling factor; NV represents\nthe variable dimension; Ui represents the upper bound of the\nvariable; Li represents the lower bound of the variable.\nWhen using the standard KH algorithm to solve the global\noptimization problem, as the number of iterations increases,\nmost of the krill moves to the same direction, which tends\nto make the problem solution fall into local optimum. The\nperturbation operator β is introduced in [19] to avoid KH\nalgorithm falling into local optimum, so as to improve the\nperformance of krill swarm optimization algorithm.\nFIGURE 7. Testing accuracies for sample points.\nTABLE 3. Transformer fault samples classification.\nPerturbation operator βis determined by equation (13)\nβ=η×ﬁtness (13)\nIn the formula, η ∈ [0,1], gradually decreases from\n1 to 0 as the number of iterations increases. The ﬁtness\nrepresents the ﬁtness of individual krill, and the greater the\nﬁtness is, the worse the solution to the problem represented\nby the individual position will be.\nRedeﬁne random diffusion based on the perturbation\noperator β:\nTK =T max(1 −t/tmax +β)δ (14)\nIn the early stage of the algorithm iteration, since the β\nvalue of the disturbance operator is relatively large, the dis-\nturbance is large; The perturbation operator β gradually\ndecreases with the increase of the number of iterations, thus\nreducing the random diffusion range of the krill population,\nwhich is beneﬁcial to the krill’s more detailed search in its\nown neighborhood, so the algorithm has stronger local opti-\nmization ability. In the later stage of the KH algorithm iter-\nation, the krill individuals move closer to the global optimal\nindividuals and are prone to fall into local optimum values.\nAfter introducing the perturbation operator β, the larger the\nﬁtness value, the larger the perturbation of krill individuals,\nwhich enables the krill to carry out a larger range of random\ndiffusion motion, thus expanding the optimization range of\nthe algorithm and avoiding the KH algorithm falling into\nlocal optimum. The ﬂow chart of the improved KH is shown\nin Figure 3.\nThe parameters of SVM are optimized by IKH algorithm\nto construct a transformer diagnostic model based on IKH\noptimized SVM. The ﬂowchart of IKHSVM fault diagnosis\nmodel is shown in Figure 4.\nVOLUME 7, 2019 102807\nY. Zhanget al.: Fault Diagnosis Model of Power Transformers Based on DGA Features Selection\nFIGURE 8. Diagnostic iterative diagram.\nThe ﬂow of the transformer fault diagnosis model is as\nfollows:\n• Normalize preprocessing of DGA ratios to eliminate the\neffect of numerical values between different ratios.\n• Establish IKHSVM fault diagnosis model by com-\nbining the IKH algorithm and Cross Validation (CV)\nprinciple.\n• Diagnose the test sample and training sample by using\nthe IKHSVM fault diagnosis model and the result can be\nobtained.\nIV. RESULT ANALYSIS\nA. FAULT SAMPLE SELECTION DATA SOURCE AND\nPARAMETER SETTING\nThe 113 groups of IEC TC 10 fault data have been divided\ninto two parts, of which 85 samples are training samples,\nand the other 28 samples are test samples. Table 3 shows the\nclassiﬁcation of 113 fault samples.\nWhen GA is used to optimize both SVM parameters and\nDGA feature quantities, GA has a maximum number of\niterations of 50 and an initially generated particle swarm\nof 10. The SVM parameters are set as follows: the range of\nthe penalty factor c and the kernel parameter σ are set to\nTABLE 4. Three Sets of feature data.\n[0, 200] and [0, 100] respectively, the number of DGA feature\nquantities is 11.\nIn the IKHSVM fault diagnosis model, the krill population\nsize is set to 100, the maximum induction speed Rmax =\n0.02, the maximum foraging speed VS =0.01, the maximum\nrandom diffusion speed =0.01, the maximum number of\niterations K = Tmax 100, and the number of CV is 9.\nThe SVM parameters are set as follows: the range of the\npenalty factor c and the kernel parameter σare set to [0, 200]\nand [0, 100] respectively.\nB. DGA FEATURE QUANTITY OPTIMIZATION RESULT\nANALYSIS\nThree sets of DGA feature combinations are selected from\n30 repeated calculations. The cross-validation accuracy and\ntest sample accuracy can be seen in Table 4.\n102808 VOLUME 7, 2019\nY. Zhanget al.: Fault Diagnosis Model of Power Transformers Based on DGA Features Selection\nFIGURE 9. Fault diagnosis results.\nThe SVM is used to diagnose the test sample - the set\nof features with the highest accuracy is selected from the\nthree sets of feature combinations and deﬁned as the new\nDGA feature combination, as shown in Figure 5. The yellow\nregions are the selected features.\nIn order to compare the impact of different feature quanti-\nties on the fault diagnosis rate, the input features of IKHSVM\nare divided into three categories: (1) DGA full data, including\nH2, CH 4, C 2H2, C 2H4, C 2H6, CO, CO 2 and total Hydro-\ncarbon; (2) The three-ratio feature quantity consists of three\ngas ratios of CH 4/H2, C2H4/C2H6, and C 2H2/C2H4; (3) The\npreferred DGA feature combinations selected in this paper.\nUsing the feature sets from three categories respectively as\nthe input of SVM and using the ﬁve fault types as outputs.\nThe IKHSVM ﬁtness curve when the optimal DGA feature\ncombination is input can be seen in Figure 6.\nTable 4 gives the statistical results of the average accuracy\nof the IKHSVM testing samples based on the three feature\nsets. It can be seen from Table 5 that the fault diagnosis\naccuracy rates of the DGA full data and the three-ratio feature\nquantity test samples are 58.93% and 74.27% respectively,\nand the accuracy of the three-ratio feature quantity is better\nthan the DGA full data. The diagnostic accuracy rate of the\nTABLE 5. Average accuracy with different feature quantities.\nnew DGA feature set is 26.78% higher than the DGA full\ndata, and 10.83% higher than the three-ratio feature quantity,\nindicating that the new DGA feature set can signiﬁcantly\nimprove the accuracy of transformer fault diagnosis. At the\nsame time, there is not much difference between the accuracy\nof the new DGA feature set, the test samples and training\nsamples of the three-ratio feature quantity. It indicates that\nthe new DGA feature set is stable for fault diagnosis and can\nreduce the interference caused by different data.\nC. COMPARISON OF DIAGNOSTIC METHOD\nIn order to show more clearly the relationship between\nthe test sample and the accuracy of penalty factor c and\nnuclear parameter σ, the search range of c and σ is set to\nVOLUME 7, 2019 102809\nY. Zhanget al.: Fault Diagnosis Model of Power Transformers Based on DGA Features Selection\nTABLE 6. Average accuracy of new DGA feature.\nFIGURE 10. Fault diagnosis results.\n500 and 250 equal parts respectively, totaling 125,000 sam-\npling points (parameter combination), and each sampling\npoint is used as the input of SVM to obtain the diagnosis\nresults. Figure 7 shows the diagnostic results at each sampling\npoint. In Figure 7, the deeper the yellow color is, the better\nthe optimization effect of SVM parameters and the higher\nthe accuracy of fault diagnosis will be; the deeper the blue\ncolor is, the lower the accuracy of diagnosis and the lower\nthe accuracy of fault diagnosis will be.\nBased on the same combination of new DGA features,\ntransformer fault diagnosis is carried out using IKHSVM,\nGASVM, BPNN and PSOSVM. The ABCD in Figure 8 show\nthe diagnostic iteration diagrams of the above four methods\nrespectively. It can be seen that the best ﬁtness of IKHSVM\nis better than the other three methods.\nThe ABCD charts of Figure 9 show the classiﬁcation\naccuracy of IKHSVM, GASVM, BPNN and PSOSVM. The\naccuracy of the four methods is 85.71% (24/28), 75% (21/28),\n64.29% (18/28) and 71.43% (20/28), respectively.\nTable 6 shows the results of transformer fault diagnosis.\nIt can be seen from Table 6 that the average testing accuracy\nof IKHSVM reaches 85.71% when the new feature set is\ninput, which is higher than that of BPNN, GASVM and\nPSOSVM as 64.29%, 75% and 71.43% respectively. Com-\npared with GASVM and PSOSVM, the average test accuracy\nof IKHSVM is higher which reﬂects that IKH algorithm has\ngood local and global optimization performance. It effec-\ntively improves the accuracy of transformer fault diagnosis.\nThe remaining 105 groups of China fault data have been\ndivided into two parts, of which 79 samples are train-\ning samples, and the other 26 samples are test samples.\nFigure 10 shows the accuracy of the IKHSVM model based\nthe above fault data is 88.46% (23/26). It can be seen the result\nis similar to that obtained by IEC TC 10 and it veriﬁes the\nreliability and validity of the IKHSVM model again.\nV. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, GA and SVM are used to optimize a set of\nnew DGA features to establish an IKHSVM transformer fault\ndiagnosis model for fault diagnosis. Fault data is prepro-\ncessed to reduce the inﬂuence of fuzzy boundary on diagnosis\nresults. The conclusions are as follows:\n• Using GA algorithm and SVM, a new DGA feature set\nof transformer fault diagnosis is selected from 11 kinds\nof DGA feature quantities. The average test accuracy of\nthe new DGA feature set is 26.78% and 10.83% higher\nthan that of the DGA full data and the three-ratio feature\nquantity respectively. The new feature set proposed in\nthis paper can accurately reﬂect the faults of the trans-\nformer, which is better than other feature quantities.\n• By using the new DGA set as input, the accuracy\nof the IKHSVM model of transformer fault diagno-\nsis reaches 85.71% which is higher than the standard\nBPNN, GASVM model and PSOSVM model. In this\ncase, IKH algorithm is more suitable for parameter\noptimization of support vector machines. It proves the\neffectiveness of the proposed method.\n• In the study, some shortcomings still existence, such\nas the insufﬁcient data samples. In the next research,\nwe should not only consider the existing small sample\ndata, but should consider more about how to be versatile\nand scalable in the context of ubiquitous power Internet\nof things and big data.\nREFERENCES\n[1] M.
