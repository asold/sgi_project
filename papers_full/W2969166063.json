TCM provides continuously the condition of cutting tool by noticing various parameters such as temperature, \nacoustic emission and vibration. One of the best ways to monitor the condition of cutting tools for unmanned machining \nis by observing tool vibration signature. In the present work, vibration signals are acquired from the cutting tool. One \nhealthy state and three faulty conditions of tools are considered for the study. The faulty tools considered in the current \nstudy are worn flank, broken tool and extended overhang. The vibration signals of these faulty tool conditions are used \nto train the machine learning algorithm. Statistical features are extracted from the vibration signal to feed as input to \nthe J48 decision tree. The classifier algorithm used in the current study is rotation forest algorithm. The algorithm uses \nonly significant features which are selected from a decision tree. The algorithm is validated with test dataset to recog-\nnize the faulty or healthy state of the tool. It was found that the algorithm could classify the tool condition with 95.00% \nclassification accuracy.\nKeywords Tool fault diagnosis · Machine learning technique · Turning operation · Vibration signal · Decision tree\n1 Introduction\nLathe produces cylindrical parts by shear deformation of \nthe workpiece with relatively high hard single-point cut -\nting tool [1]. The parts produced on lathe find numerous \napplications in the engineering field—the extent of quality \nrequired varies application to application [2 ]. The desired \nsurface finish on a machined component is achieved by \ncontinuous monitoring of anomalies in the cutting process \nsuch as tool wear, workpiece hardness and the geometry \nof the tool [3]. To check the factors influencing the machin-\ning process, continuous monitoring of the tool health is \nnecessary. Tool condition monitoring ensures machining \ntakes place as desired without compromise in the qual-\nity of the job produced [4 ]. The online monitoring of the \nmachining process increases the production rate and mini-\nmizes the scrap created due to poor machining [5].\nTool condition monitoring (TCM) is a technique to keep \na check on tool condition, kind of surface finish produced \non the workpiece. With TCM, one can identify anomalies \ninfluencing the metal cutting process. TCM was applied \nto various machining operations such as drilling, milling \nand turning. Madhusudana et al. [6 , 7] experimented to \ndiagnose milling tool condition through vibration signals. \nHistogram features were extracted from vibration signals \npertaining to healthy and faulty conditions of the tool. A \ndecision tree was used to capture significant features in \nthe dataset. K-star algorithm was used as a classifier to \nidentify various classes of fault in the milling tool.\nWang et al. [8] studied the application of support vector \nmachine (SVM) in multiclass gear fault diagnosis. Classifi-\ncation accuracy was found to be excellent when training \ndata set and testing data set belonged to identical rota-\ntional speed.

Ma et al. [9 ] used the random forest algorithm \nto predict the tool life of the milling cutter with 315 num-\nber of milling test data. The results were compared with \nother algorithms such as artificial neural network (ANN) \nand support vector regression (SVR) and random forest \n(RF). It was found that RF had better tool life prediction \naccuracy than the rest of two. Bartarya and Choudhury [3] \nreviewed papers on various machining operations. Kishore \net al. [10] designed a magnetorheological damper to con-\ntrol tool vibration during hard turning. The implementa-\ntion of damper improved the surface finish on the work -\npiece and reduced tool wear and cutting force. Ventura \net al. [ 11] investigated the development of compressive \nresidual stress on cutting edge and explained the possible \ncause for the encountered phenomenon. Kuljanic and Sor-\ntino [12] introduced torque force indicator (TFD) and nor-\nmalized cutting force indicator (NCF) as online tool wear \nindicators of milling process by studying the feature vector \nparameters of cutting force signal obtained using rotating \ndynamometer. Dutta et al. [13] reviewed the development \nof digital image processing technique in tool condition \nmonitoring. Teti et al. [14] presented the keynote paper \non past contributions of CIRP in tool condition monitor -\ning, process control, sensor fusion and future challenges, \nadvanced signal processing and recent trends in machin-\ning operation. Kothuru et al. [15] performed comparison \nstudies of SVM and convolutional neural network (CNN) \ntechnique in the field of machining operation. Progression \nof wear rate in cutting tool and variation in hardness in \nthe workpiece were analysed by utilizing the above-said \ntechniques as decision-making models.\n2  Methodology\nVarious conditions of tool considered for the study are a \nhealthy tool, a tool with breakage, worn flank face and \nextended overhang. Machining is carried out on a uni-\nversal lathe machine with these conditions separately. An \naccelerometer is mounted on the tool holder to acquire \nthe vibration signal. The behaviour of the tool for various \ntool conditions is recorded by acquiring the vibration sig-\nnal. The vibrations signals are acquired using a National \nInstruments data acquisition system (DAQ) and recorded \nin a laptop for interpretation and post-processing.\nThe signal is converted into tabular form, and statisti-\ncal features are extracted by feeding into an analysis of \nvariance (ANOVA) tool. The significant features, which will \nhelp in classifying the tool condition, are selected by using \na decision tree. The exact classification of tool conditions \nthrough the selected significant features is done using \nrotation forest algorithm. Classification results obtained \nfrom rotation forest algorithm is validated using ten fold \ncross validation method in WEKA software (Fig. 1).\n3  Experimental setup\nExperiments were carried out on all geared precision \nlathe—panther 1350/2 with cutting parameters set \naccording to tool maker’s recommendations with a feed \nrate of 0.35 mm/rev and depth of cut (DOC) of 0.5 mm—\nindexable insert used for the hard turning of AISI 1040. \nThe experimental setup comprises lathe, a piezoelectric \naccelerometer, NI DAQ and a computer with preinstalled \nLabVIEW software. The workpiece with 60 mm diameter \nand 250 mm length is used. The workpiece is held firmly \nin the three-jaw chuck and cutting tool secured rigidly into \nthe tool holder. The Piezotronics (make) accelerometer \nwas mounted on the tool post using a magnetic mount. \nThe sampling rate at which the vibration signal acquired \nwas 25 kHz. The schematic of the experimental setup is \nshown in Fig. 2. The actual established experimental setup \nis shown in Fig. 3.\n3.1  Experimental procedure\nIn the present work, AISI 1040 steel is used as work mate -\nrial for the experiment.

Specimen preparation is done prior to \nthe experimentation by turning the workpiece to remove \nthe oxide layer and achieve roundness. The machine tool \nis allowed to stabilize after the start of the machine tool for \nany random vibration if present [16, 17]. The different tool \nconditions considered for the experiment were:\n1. A proper mounted but with breakage; labelled as \n‘breakage’\n2. A proper mounted but with flank wear; labelled as \n‘flank wear’\n3.

The vibration sig-\nnals corresponding to healthy and faulty conditions are \nshown in Fig. 5. It is observed that ‘maximum’ and ‘range’ \nfor the healthy condition are small and narrow, whereas \nfor the faulty condition, the ‘max’ and ‘range’ are more and \nbroad.

A feature is distinguishing \nproperty obtained from a section of a pattern (here vibra-\ntion signal). Features are extracted to represent the impor-\ntant information hidden in the signal by decomposing the \nsignal. Statistical features extracted in the current study \nare mean, sum, minimum, maximum, variance, standard \ndeviation, kurtosis and skewness [ 18]. These features are \ndescribed in Table 1.\n5  Decision tree as tool for feature selection\nA decision tree is a pictorial representation of an algorithm \nas a tree-like model with conditional control statement \nvisible. The decision tree has nodes, branches and roots to \nrepresent the classification of samples according to heu-\nristic model. A decision will have a single root node for \ncomplete training set of data. A new node is added to the \ntree for every partition [6 ]. The detailed steps involved in \ndeveloping the decision tree are listed below [19]:\n1. The tree starts with a node representing the training \nsamples of data collected\n2. If the samples are all of the same class, then they are \nlabelled as leaf\n3. Otherwise, the algorithm will divide the samples into \nindividual classes based on the entropy-based meas-\nure known as information gain by discretizing every \nattribute to select the optimal threshold.\n4. To create the branch, samples are portioned for each \nbest discrete interval\n5. The algorithm uses the same steps mentioned above \nrepeatedly to form the decision tree\n6. This repetition process to form the tree stops once one \nof the following criteria is met \na. When all the samples of a node given belong to \none class\nb. When there is no attribute remaining to partition \nthe samples\nc. When samples get exhausted for the branch test \nattribute\n6  Rotation forest algorithm\nRotation forest (RF) goals at the construction of precise \nand varied classifiers.

Ensemble classifier unites the predictions of \nseveral classifiers instead of only one classifier. Because \nensemble reduces the variance and bias, it is essential to \nalter the data set bagging, boosting or learning method \nto create different classifiers.\nLet X = [x\n1, x2…xn]T be a data point with n features and \nX be an N × n matrix containing the training examples. \nY = [y1, y2……yn]T is class label with c classes. Assume that \ntrue class labels of all training examples are also provided. \nThe ensemble vector is D  = {D\n1, D2….DL}, where L  is the \nnumber of different classifiers in the ensemble and F is \nthe feature set. All classifiers can be trained in parallel. The \ndetailed study has been carried out by Rodríguez et al. [20]\n7  Results and discussion\n7.1  Statistical feature extraction \nfor the experimental dataset\nStatistical features were extracted by analysis of variance \n(ANOVA). The labelled data set containing vibration signal \ninformation in tabular form is given to the software. Only \ntangential vibration was considered for the study which \nwas dominant than the rest of other directions. A one sec-\nond data of vibration signal of a class (tool condition) had \n25,600 data points. There were thirty second data for each \nclass; there were four classes in the experiment. One sec -\nond data set is reduced to 12 statistical features.\nRandom tree (RT) algorithm is one variant of decision \ntrees. There were 12 statistical features, which were fed to \nthe RT algorithm. Figure  6 shows the decision tree which \nused seven features, namely SE of mean, standard devia-\ntion, variance, kurtosis, sum, maximum and skewness for \nthe classification of features. These features serve as input \nto the classification algorithm. Looking at the decision tree \ndiagram, one can observe that ‘overhang’ class has been \nclassified with two features; ‘proper’ class classified with \nthree features; ‘flank wear’ classified with five features; and \n‘breakage’ classified with seven features. The class, which \nuses more features, has data similarity with other classes.\n7.2  Tool fault classification using rotation forest \nalgorithm\nTwelve statistical features pertaining to vibration signal \nare obtained for all 120 samples and given as input to the \nfeature selection algorithm (decision tree). The decision \ntree used standard error, standard deviation, variance, kur-\ntosis, sum, maximum and skewness as significant features \nto classify the different classes of data [21].\nThe confusion matrix of the rotation forest algorithm is \npresented in Table 2. The matrix in the table comprises four \nrows and four columns. The number of rows depends on \nthe number of instances considered. The confusion matrix \nobtained from the decision tree is discussed below [22]:\n• The diagonal elements give information about cor -\nrectly classified instances in the confusion matrix.\n• The first number in the first line corresponds to ‘proper’ \nstate being classified correctly as ‘proper condition’ .\n• The second number in the first line signifies the mis-\nclassified instance belonging to ‘proper’ as flank wear\nTable 1  Statistical features and their definition\nSl. no.

A similar analysis holds \ngood for the subsequent rows.\nIn Table 2, the rotation forest algorithm has classified all \n30 instances of proper mounted and healthy state of tool \ncorrectly. Extended overhang instances are also classified \naccurately. Breakage: 26 instances are correctly classified \nas breakage, and the rest four instances are misclassified as \nflank wear. Flank wear: 26 instances are correctly classified \nas flank wear, and the rest four instances are misclassified \nas breakage. This misclassification is due to the similarity \nin features of breakage and flank wear.\nDetailed class-wise accuracy in classifying a tool condi-\ntion is presented in Table  3. The table presents the frac -\ntion of data set of a class being classified correctly and \nincorrectly. In detailed classification accuracy matrix, a \ntrue positive (TP rate) corresponds to ‘correct classifica-\ntion accuracy’ , and for better classification, the value of \nTP rate should be ‘1’ . Similarly, the false positive rate (FP \nrate) corresponds to ‘accuracy in misclassification’ . For bet-\nter classification accuracy, the value of FP rate should be \nclose to ‘0’ . The TP rate for breakage is less than 1 due to \nmisclassification of breakage into flank wear. Similarly, TP \nrate for flank wear is also less than 1 due to misclassifica-\ntion of flank wear as breakage. \nA comparative study of different classifiers is carried \nout to choose the best classifier. Table  4 lists the various \nclassifiers’ efficiency. Rotation forest algorithm resulted \nin classification efficiency of 95.0%. J48 and Naïve Bayes \nwere inferior to RT in classifying the tool condition. Hence, \nrotation forest algorithm is used for classification in the \ncurrent study.\nFig. 6  Decision tree (RT) based on statistical features of vibration data\nTable 2  Rotation forest confusion matrix\nj k l m ← Classified as\n30 0 0 0 j = proper\n0 30 0 0 k = overhang\n0 0 26 4 l = Breakage\n0 0 4 26 m = flank wear\nVol.:(0123456789)\nSN Applied Sciences (2019) 1:1017 | https://doi.org/10.1007/s42452-019-1028-9 \n Research Article\n8  Conclusion\nFault diagnosis of carbide tool insert of rough turning tool \nwas carried out using the vibration signal of the turning \nprocess. From the acquired vibration signals, descriptive \nstatistical features were obtained. Significant features \nwhich give relevant information about different classes of \ntool condition were selected by using decision tree algo -\nrithm. In view of improving classification accuracy, various \nclassifiers were compared and it was found that rotation \nforest algorithm classified the instances with 95.00% accu-\nracy. Hence, a decision tree with rotation forest algorithm \ncan be suggested for condition monitoring or fault diag-\nnosis of a cutting tool.\nCompliance with ethical standards \nConflict of interest The authors declare that they have no conflict of \ninterest.\nReferences\n 1.
