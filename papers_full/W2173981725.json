    "abstract": "Transformers are an indispensable element in the transmission and distribution of electricity. While they are highly efficient, the increasing global demand for electrical energy has prompted efforts to improve their performance. No-load power losses constitute the majority of total losses within electrical energy distribution, especially when looking at load ratio. In recent years, some studies have found that no-load power losses of amorphous core transformers are less than those of laminated steel core transformers by as much as 60{\\%} to 70{\\%}. For this paper, we have manufactured an amorphous distribution transformer prototype rated 33 kV and 1 MVA. By quantifying its design considerations, power losses, and the energy efficiency value, we studied the outcome of replacing laminated steel core transformers with this new type of machine.",
