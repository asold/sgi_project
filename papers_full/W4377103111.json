    "abstract": "The simultaneous advances in deep learning and the Internet of Things (IoT) have benefited distributed deep learning paradigms. Federated learning is one of the most promising frameworks, where a server works with local learners to train a global model. The intrinsic heterogeneity of IoT devices, or non-independent and identically distributed (Non-I.I.D.) data, combined with the unstable communication network environment, causes a bottleneck that slows convergence and degrades learning efficiency. Additionally, the majority of weight averaging-based model aggregation approaches raise questions about learning fairness. In this paper, we propose a peer-to-peer federated learning (P2PFL) framework based on Vision Transformers (ViT) models to help solve some of the above issues and classify COVID-19 vs. normal cases on Chest-X-Ray (CXR) images. Particularly, clients jointly iterate and aggregate the models in order to build a robust model. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is capable of significantly improving the performance of the model with an Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.92 and 0.99 for hospital-1 and hospital-2, respectively.",
