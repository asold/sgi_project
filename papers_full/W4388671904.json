    "abstract": "In the field of ecology, we are facing urgent challenges related to biodiversity loss, global change and ecosystem sustainability. In this context, the application of Foundation Models emerges as a powerful tool. These models have the potential to reshape our understanding of natural systems, incorporating large volumes of data from different sources and generating results with a more holistic view of ecosystem functioning. However, the application of foundational models in ecology presents challenges that will need to be addressed, such as model interpretation, training efficiency, and the ethical considerations due their implementation.",
