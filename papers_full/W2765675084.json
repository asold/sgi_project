In this paper the control strategy of power electronic transformer (PET) is proposed. The analyzed structure of PET uses two seven-level \ncascaded H-bridge (CHB) rectifiers.

MORAWIEC * and A. LEWICKI\nGdansk University of Technology, 11/12 Narutowicza St., 80-169 Gdańsk\ninverters [6]. Among all types of inverters, cascaded H-bridge \nconverters are the most interesting [7]. The main advantage of \nthe CHB converter is its modular structure. Such converters are \nconstructed using single cells with H-bridges and a  capacitor. \nThe converter output voltage is the sum of output voltages gen-\nerated by the H-bridges. Increasing the level of inverter output \nvoltage or increasing the amplitude of output voltage can be \ndone easily by adding more cells to the converter structure [8]. \nThe structure of the control system applied in CHB inverter \ncan be the same for any number of H-bridges and levels of \noutput voltage. The CHB converters are popular especially in \nrenewable generation systems [9], as well as in energy storage \nsystems [10] and STATCOM applications [11].\nEach cell of a CHB converter includes an single-phase in\n-\nverter, a capacitive DC-link and a rectifier. The voltage sources \nconnected to the cells have to be independent or isolated [7, \n12]. The galvanic isolation can be realized using grid-connected \nsingle-phase or multi-phase transformers [7] or using isolated \nDC-DC converters in CHB converter topology [13]. The appli\n-\ncation of DC-DC converters with high- or medium- frequency \ntransformers makes the inverter cheaper and smaller.\nThis paper concentrates on the structure and the control \nsystem of a power electronic transformer which is based on \ndouble CHB inverters. Such a PET configuration is presented \nin Fig. 1. The structure of power electronic transformer consists \nof two seven-level CHB converters, and the single cell of PET \nis shown in Fig. 2. The DABs with MF transformers transfer \nthe energy between DC-link circuits. The presented solution \nreduces the size and cost of overall converter structures. The \nmain task of the control algorithms for single CHB inverter is \nto generate the output voltage correctly and to maintain uniform \nvoltage distribution on the DC-link capacitors. While the output \nvoltage is generated, the DC-link voltages of the CHB converter \nvary depending on the CHB output voltage and current. The \nDC-link voltages can be equalized by sharing the generated \noutput voltage between the H-bridges [14], by modifying their \nmodulation indexes [15] or using fuzzy logic control loop [11]. \n1. Introduction\nPower-electronic converters are widely used in smart grid ap -\nplications. They can be used in active filter applications for \ntotal harmonic distortion (THD) improvement and reactive \npower compensation, in energy storage systems, as well as for \nthe integration of renewable generation systems [1, 2]. Usu -\nally, electrical energy is converted using medium-voltage (MV) \nconverters. medium voltage converters can be based on current \nsource inverter topology (CSI) with thyristors as switching de\n-\nvices [19–20]. However, the CSI drawbacks (the fact that cur -\nrent THD is approximately 10% or higher and the resonance \nproblems) make voltage-source inverters an interesting solution \nfor MV applications.\nThe MV converters can be based on two-level voltage source \ninverter (VSI) structure with high-blocking voltage IGBTs. This \ntype of converters usually works with low switching frequency \ndue to relatively high energy losses [3–5].\nIn smart grid applications, due to current THD, it is rec -\nommended to use the power-electronic converters with rela -\ntively high switching frequencies. This assumption determines \nthe use of low-voltage transistors in the converter topology. \nMultilevel (ML) VSI solutions meet that requirement in MV \napplications [3, 6, 7, 21]. The output voltage of ML inverter is \nhigher than the blocking voltage of transistors. Additionally, the \nlow voltage IGBTs are characterized by higher switching fre -\nquencies and lower saturation voltage as compared with high-\nblocking voltage transistors. The shape of the output voltage of \nML inverter is close to sinusoidal, and the voltage and current \ndistortions are low.\nThe most popular structures of ML converters are diode- \nclamped, capacitor clamped and cascaded H-bridge (CHB) \nMULTILEVEL CONVERTERS\n676\nBull.

The \nH-bridges in active state generate positive or negative output \nvoltage (0 < γ ∙ 1 or –1 ∙ γ < 0), while the output voltage of \nH-bridges in bypass state is equal to zero ( γ = 0).

The selection of H-bridges \nused to generate the inverter output voltage depends on the \ndirection of the instantaneous power and the DC-link voltages. \nIf the following condition is fulfilled, the H-bridges with the \nlowest DC-link voltages will be used before the others:\n i(p) ¢ u\n¤\n(p) > 0,  (8)\nwhere: i(p) is the “p” phase current of the CHB inverter ( p = a, \nb or c), u¤\n(p) is the reference phase voltage determined using the \nreverse Clarke transformation and the reference output voltage \nvector from the control system.\nOtherwise, the H-bridges with the highest DC-link volt -\nages will be used first. That is why the DC-links with the \nlowest voltages are charged while the DC-links with the \nhighest voltages are discharged for the entire pulse period. \nThe output voltage vector U o\n1 generated in the three H-bridges \n(one H-bridge in any of inverter phases, chosen in a manner \ndescribed above) with the duty cycles equal to ±1, as shown in \nFig. 7.

Simulation results\nThe proposed control system was tested in the numerical Mat -\nlab-Simulink simulation. The grid voltage is 3.3 kV and the \nnominal current of PET is about 100 A. The nominal active \npower is 600 kV A. Each of the H-bridges is equipped with 1 mF \ncapacitors.\nThe phase current and voltage waveforms are shown in \nFig. 10. The reactive power is equal to zero. Fig. 11 shows the \nphase to phase voltage and in Fig. 12, phase current during \nchange of DC-link voltages up to 2.9 kV is shown. The DC-link \nvoltages waveforms are presented in Fig. 13. The reference DC-\nlink voltage is initially set to 1.1 kV , and increased to 2.9 kV \nafter 0.1 s. For this case the AC grid phase “a” voltage was \nchanged from 2.5 s to 0.8 Un and from 3.5 s to 1.2 Un from 4.5 s \nto nominal voltage U n. This unbalanced AC grid voltage test \n(20% Un) shows that it does not directly affect stability of the \nwhole PET system. Simulated changes of the AC grid voltage \nare for 1 s. The DC-link voltages remain on similar level for \nthe three phases.\nSmall changes (additional oscillation time) of the DC-link \nvoltages are visible in Fig. 14 during the test of AC-filter pa -\nFig. 13.

Therefore the \nfilter parameters should be chosen so as to avoid the resonance \nproblem and to provide the adequate performance and small \nsize of the PET system.\n6.

Conclusions\nThe paper presents the control system, simulation and exper -\nimental results of the power electronic transformer. The PET \nsystem is based on two seven-level cascaded H-bridge con -\nverters. The control strategy for cascaded H-bridge converter \nand the space-vector pulse width modulation were analyzed. All \ntheoretical assumptions are confirmed by the simulation and \nexperimental results. The proposed control strategies for PET, \ncascaded H-bridge converters and dual-active bridges allow \nfor stabilizing all the DC-link voltages and for controlling the \ntransmitted power of PET. The input and output power factors \nof PET are equal to 1 and the PET efficiency is high. The ef\n-\nficiency and THD tests of proposed PET structure and control \nsystem gave the following results: the current THD is 3.4%, \nand the efficiency is 94.3%.\nThe control systems of the double CHB rectifier and all \nthe DABs were not coupled and worked independently of each \nother. The proposed solution makes it possible to control the \nDC-link voltages in steady and transient states. The results of \nFig. 18. Experimental laboratory setup\nFig. 17.
