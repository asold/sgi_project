This is\ndue to the widespread introductionof electronic health records (EHRs),\nadvances in medical imaging, and the integration of large-scale genomic\nanalyses into clinical routine. Effective use of this large amount of data is\nimportant for ensuring the optimal treatment for cancer patients. Artiﬁcial\nintelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have shown promise in helping\nhealthcare professionals to process such data.\nAI’sa p p l i c a t i o ni nd o m a i n sl i k eo n c o l o g yh a se x p e r i e n c e dp e r i -\nodic surges of activity. Prior to 2012,AI technologies played a marginal\nrole in oncology research. Computer-based data analysis studies\nmostly relied on classical ML algorithms with a modest model com-\nplexity. 2012 marked a turning point in computer-based data analysis:\nimage processing, a notoriously dif ﬁcult task, was suddenly made\nmuch easier with the advent of convolutional neural networks (CNNs).\nThis technological shift was subse quently integrated into medical\nresearch\n1, most notably evidenced by a 2017 publication demonstrat-\ning neural network performance on par with human experts across\nlarge image datasets\n2. In parallel, hardware improvements have gra-\ndually lowered the computational barriers for training and deploying\nresource-intensive models, thus broadening the user base capable of\ndeveloping and reﬁning AI algorithms3.\nBetween 2012 and 2022, neural networks were applied in\nnumerous studies that primarily focused on the analysis of oncological\nimaging or text\n1. Regulatory bodies in the United States and the Eur-\nopean Union approved a number of specialized AI-based tools for\ncancer, particularly in radiological and pathological image analysis.\nHowever, high-proﬁle and ambitious initiatives, such as IBM Watson,\ndid not achieve their projected outcomes\n4. This decade can be viewed as\na stabilization phase for AI applications in oncology, marked by\nincremental improvements and sp ecialized uses, predominantly in\nimage analysis\n5. This landscape changed in 2022 and 2023 with the\nadvent of two key innovations: large language models (LLMs) and\nmultimodal AI models.\nLLMs are deep learning models that serve the purpose of both\nprocessing and generating primarily text-based data\n6. The training\ndata for these models is a large and diverse amount of text, usually\nsourced from the internet and commercial data providers, and can\ninclude diverse types of medical data\n7. While potentially this purpose\ncan also be fulﬁlled by various model architectures, the most successful\nmodels have recently relied on transformer-based architectures per-\ntaining to their attention mechanisms 8. Their training process is\nautoregressive, which means that the model is trained to predict sub-\nsequent tokens in a sequence (similar to words in a sentence). Notably,\nmodel performance scales with size, i.e. number of parameters, and\nlarger models show emergent behavior\n9: They acquire an under-\nstanding of concepts underlying the training data without having been\nexplicitly trained on this. When LLMs are applied on new tasks without\nexplicit training, this is referred to as a“ zero-shot ” application. The\nLLM Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) 3.5 by OpenAI\ngained widespread attention in 2022 because it was made available as a\nchatbot in the“ chatGPT” user interface and demonstrated impressive\nconversational skills. It was later succeeded by GPT-4, which displayed\nmuch-improved knowledge retrieval and logical reasoning capacities\nwith far fewer hallucinations\n7.\n1Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, University Hospital Aachen, Aachen, Germany.2Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital\nCarl Gustav Carus, Technical University Dresden, Dresden, Germany.3Else Kroener Fresenius Center for Digital Health, Technical University Dresden,\nDresden, Germany.4National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.\n5Department of Medical Oncology, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.\ne-mail: jakob-nikolas.kather@alumni.dkfz.de\nnpj Precision Oncology|            (2024) 8:72 1\n1234567890():,;\n1234567890():,;\nA common application area under exploration for these LLMs is\nhealthcare7. LLMs can be applied to medical problems through different\napproaches. One approach is to train these models speci ﬁcally on\nmedical data (Fig.1A). One of theﬁrst language models to be success-\nfully transferred to the medical domain was Bio-BERT, which showed\nrobust capabilities for biomedical text mining10.A l s o ,G o o g l e’sL L M\n“ PALM” was ﬁne-tuned on medical training data, resulting in Med-\nPaLM, which outperformed its previous version in medical use cases11.\nRecently, Google has introduced the next iteration, Med-PaLM 2, which\nscored a high 86.5% in the US Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE)\n12.\nSolving USMLE questions is a common benchmark test for LLMs, yet it\nis of limited use for real-world applications. However,ﬁne-tuned LLMs\nhave been shown to solve real-world problems such as predicting clinical\noutcomes just based on unstructured text data in EHRs\n13. Other ways to\napply LLMs on medical problems do not requireﬁne-tuning: Generalist\nLLMs can often be applied to medical tasks by just using a detailed input\nprompt. Another alternative is the use of“ Retrieval Augmented Gen-\neration” (RAG) by which domain knowledge can be provided to a\ntrained LLM in machine-readable format (Fig.1B).\nToday’s LLMs are transformer neural networks. This network archi-\ntecture is well suited for almost any type of data, and enables multimodality.\nMultimodal AI systems are capable of interpreting multiple types of data\ntogether, such as textual and image data. Their development and validation\nrequire collaborative efforts between a number of disciplines including but\nnot limited to medical experts in diagnostic specialties such as radiology or\npathology and specialties such as surgery or medicine as well as technology\nexperts both in software and hardware. Multimodal AI systems have been\nevaluated for various applications in precision oncology, such as outcome\npredictions\n14,15. However, more scientiﬁc evidence is required to ensure that\nLLMs and multimodal models provide quantiﬁable beneﬁts in oncology.\nWhenever a model is pre-trained on large and diverse tasks, and is\nsubsequently applied to specialized tasks, it can be referred to as a“foun-\ndation model”16. Foundation models reduce the data requirements for\nspecialized tasks, for example in pr edicting diseases from retinal\nphotographs17. For instance, linking images from chest X-rays to corre-\nsponding report text data, and foundation models can alleviate the need for\ntime-consuming and laborious manual annotation while preserving\nhuman-level accuracies and outperforming supervised methods\n18.I nc l i n -\nical practice, such models may be deployed in the form of chatbot assistants\nthat can aid diagnosis in an interactive manner19. Similar examples exist in\npathology, where large image datasets are linked with contextual knowledge\nand case-speciﬁc information yielding high performance in disease\nFig. 1 | Overview of medical adaptations of LLMs. AIntegrating information from\nvarious sources comprising domain knowledge from databases and patient related\ndocuments including different modalities (imaging, text, tabular, numerical data).\nB Possible model adaptation strategies include: Combining user prompts with\nrelevant source documents and examples (few-shot prompting, top). Retrieval\naugmented generation (RAG), in which the information from A gets processed by a\nseparate embedding model and is stored in a database. Relevant information can\nthen be retrieved based on similarity measures with a user input (middle). Docu-\nments can be used to continue the training process and adapt the model parameters\nfor speciﬁc use cases (bottom). Procedures are sorted by complexity and compu-\ntational cost in increasing order.C Selected possible use cases for LLMs in clinical\nroutine.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41698-024-00573-2 Perspective\nnpj Precision Oncology|            (2024) 8:72 2\ndetection as well as biomarker prediction and can also inform further\ndiagnostic procedures such as additional stains20,21. Furthermore, early\ngeneralist models have been introduced which show consistently high\nperformance across a variety of medical domains and tasks integrating\nknowledge from diverse domains22,23. Given the resource-intensive nature of\ntraining models with parameter sizes inthe billions, there is a trend towards\nimproving model efﬁciency by reducing model size while retaining model\nperformance. Recent advances with open-sourced models yield the per-\nspective of de novo model training and development at much lower\nﬁnancial and computational burdens\n24.\nAs foundation models diversify their capabilities, they open up\nnew avenues for their potential application in oncology and cancer\nresearch, such as multimodal diagnostics and drug discovery. How-\never, to fully unlock the potential of foundation models in oncology\nand cancer research, several challenges must be addressed. Firstly, the\nunderlying data the model is trained on has to be carefully assessed for\nquality, quantity, and diversity\n25. Secondly, the design of systems\nwhich integrate foundation models should be guided not only by\nexperts in computer science, but also by medical professionals and\npatient advocates as well as the broader scienti ﬁcc o m m u n i t y .\nThirdly, the integration of such models in operable clinical software\nsystems faces legal and regulatory challenges because these models\nrequire approval as medical devices\n26. Fourthly, ongoing model eva-\nluation, validation and improvement are important to maintain\nquality, safety, and usefulness in light of the accelerating pace with\nwhich scientiﬁc discoveries are translated into novel medicines and\nguidelines. Lastly, a prominent concern of AI models based on neural\nnetwork architecture is their often criticized lack of interpretability\nwhich earned them the term ‘black boxes ’\n27,28.W h i l es u b s t a n t i a l\nprogress has been made in model explainability for image-related\ntasks, fewer studies address explainability in text processing or\nmultimodal tasks in medicine\n29.\nOverall, the advancements in LLMs and multimodal models have the\npotential to impact the practice of oncology through many different\napplications (Fig.1C). This“Collection” in “npj Precision Oncology” aims\nto collect articles that provide solid empirical evidence for applications of\nthese models in precision oncology.\nReceived: 21 September 2023; Accepted: 12 March 2024;\nReferences\n1.
