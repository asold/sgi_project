    "abstract": "Epilepsy is a chronic and recurrent brain dysfunction disease. An acute epileptic attack will interfere with a patient’s normal behavior and consciousness, having a great impact on their life. The purpose of this study was to design a seizure prediction model to improve the quality of patients’ lives and assist doctors in making diagnostic decisions. This paper presents a transformer-based seizure prediction model. Firstly, the time-frequency characteristics of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were extracted by short-time Fourier transform (STFT). Secondly, a three transformer tower model was used to fuse and classify the features of the EEG signals. Finally, when combined with the attention mechanism of transformer networks, the EEG signal was processed as a whole, which solves the problem of length limitations in deep learning models. Experiments were conducted with a Children’s Hospital Boston and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology database to evaluate the performance of the model. The experimental results show that, compared with previous EEG classification models, our model can enhance the ability to use time, frequency, and channel information from EEG signals to improve the accuracy of seizure prediction.",
