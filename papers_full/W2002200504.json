    "abstract": "An increasing amount of distributed generation in the future grid will be connected at the customer's point of connection. The generation within the low voltage grid will affect the power quality of customers connected to this grid. Hence, the concept of a Smart MV/LV transformer as a part of the Smart MV/LV substation is discussed in this paper. The main aims are to support the accommodation of distributed generation among the LV grid and to ensure that the voltage levels will comply with the power quality standards for all customers connected to that grid.",
