  "abstract": "Power transformers are located in the electrical transmission and distribution networks where different voltage levels are needed. The turn ratio of the low voltage and high voltage windings is mechanically controlled by an on-load tap changer or de-energized tap changer. As the tap changer is the transformer’s only moving part, it is highly susceptible to mechanical failure and aging degradation. While some diagnostic tools have been used to determine the mechanical condition of tap changer contacts, not much attention was given to use the frequency response analysis to diagnose the transformer’s tap changers’ mechanical integrity. This paper is taking one step forward into maturing the application of the frequency response analysis (FRA) technique to detect transformer tap changer faults. In this regard, two common tap changer faults are created, and experimental testing for four FRA test configurations is conducted. For a better understanding of the tap changer fault mechanism, an electrical equivalent circuit model is proposed and designed using Simulink. The simulation and implementation of the equivalent circuits using MATLAB\\R2018a.",
