    "abstract": "In this paper we present a new approach in Tifinagh character recognition using a combination of, k-nearest neighbor algorithm and the bigram language model. After the preprocessing of the text image, and the word segmentation, for each image character, the k-NN algorithm proposes candidates weighted of their membership degree. Then we use the bigram language model to choose the most appropriate sequence of characters. Results show that our method increases the recognition rate.",
