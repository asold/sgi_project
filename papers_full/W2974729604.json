INTRODUCTION\nExiting distribution system is changing its dynamics due\nto advancement of power electronics and integration of\nrenewable energies into existing conventional grid [1].\nModernization and novelty of the power supply in a distri-\nbution system is considered as a main facet in upcoming\npower supply challenges. Solid State Transformer, which is\na power electronics-based transformer (PET), is taken as one\nof the advanced technologies for Future Renewable Electric\nEnergy Distribution and Management (FREEDM) Systems\nCenter coupled with main research topics in power elec-\ntronics ﬁeld [2]. It comprises almost all relevant types of\nconversion, which are necessitated in power supply. Solid\nState Transformer (SST) also plays a pivotal role in such\nsystems, especially in provisioning links for integration of\nDistributed Energy Resources (DER), Distributed Energy\nStorage (DES) and intelligent loads [3]. In preceding two\ndecades, Solid State Transformers [SSTs] have grown so\nrapidly that presently it is considered for relieving the\nexisting traditional low frequency transformer (50/60Hz),\nwhere weight & volume savings, substantial efﬁciency\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Tariq Masood\n.\nimprovement and cost economization can be achieved.\nNumerous different topologies, conﬁgurations, systems,\napplications and uses of SST technology have been proposed\nand also analyzed to certain extent. Among these topologies,\nthe most viable, workable and practical SST topology is the\none which consists of three main stages containing a rectiﬁer,\nisolation via a medium frequency transformer and lastly the\nlow frequency inverter to reproduce line frequency AC. It is\nthe most accepted topology, due to the ability for provisioning\ncorrection for power factor and compensation for reactive\npower with a supplementary bus [4]–[10]. Three stage\nSST block diagram is illustrated in Fig-1.\nIn this illustration, a DC-DC converter stage in a medium\nfrequency transformer isolated scenario, not only facilitates\nfor provision of the galvanic isolation with a dc bus, but\nit also plays a promising role in ascertaining the overall\nsystem efﬁciency and effectiveness with the power den-\nsity. Hence in such cognizance, it came to conclusion that\nDC-DC converter is the most vital & key challenges in\ndesigning SST and further in DC-DC converter module,\na PWM inverter design is the most promising task. Till date,\nthe fabrication of SST in various scenarios is in research\nphase, where full bridge topology of such type of inverter has\nbeen deliberated.\n140152 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Three stage Block schemes of SST [4]–[10].\nOn contrary to three stage topology, in case of a single\nstage SST, a dc link does not exist, which strongly limits\nits functionality, integration of renewable energy sources and\nenergy storage devices. This absence of dc link dictates no\narrangement for voltage regulation and reactive power com-\npensation; hence no input power factor correction. Therefore,\nsingle stage topologies are not considered suitable contestants\nin SST applications [11]. Two stages SSTs with high volt-\nage DC (i.e. HVDC) link are not appropriate topologies as\nthese are devoid of isolation arrangement from the grid, thus\nnot complying with smart grid requirements. In addition, this\nDC link is not appropriate for distributed energy store (DES)\nand distributed energy resources (DER). The requirement\nof large size of ﬁlters for removing large ripple currents\nto achieve voltage regulation is the main drawback of this\ntopology and hence practically not feasible in SST applica-\ntions. The PWM inverter part of this topology is a double\nphase inverter and is common for high order SST topologies\n(i.e. three stages) as well [12].\nTo address the requirement of high-power capability of\nthe isolation stage of SST and medium voltage (MV) capa-\nbility, one approach is to take on the semiconductor tech-\nnology and then connecting directly semiconductor devices\nin successions where the requisite higher nominal potentials\ncan be achieved, whilst maintaining conventional converter\narrangements too. The other and supplementary approach\nrevolves in furnishing a novel converter topology in line with\nalready established semiconductor technology (i.e. multilevel\nconverters [13]or modular converters [14]–[16]. The former\nway of design carries the advantage of a well-known and com-\nprehended design structure with control techniques, whereas\nthe newly developed devices seem to be more expensive and\nthese higher rating devices result in higher switching loss\non operating switching frequency greater than 2kHz. In that\nscenario such method fails in achieving improved power\ndensity and high efﬁciency. In prevailing converter topology,\nthe modular approach undertakes an illustrious, efﬁcient and\neconomically sound semiconductor device in establishing the\nmedium voltage (MV) power conversion [17], [18]. A mod-\nular approach carries the advantages of: (1) enhanced relia-\nbility and consistency (2) standardization of the components\nfor achieving cost/time reduction (3) easy reconﬁguration of\npower systems in supporting varying speciﬁcation in regards\nto input-output and (4) the most likely the raised efﬁciency\nwith deﬁnite improved power density of the system in overall\nperspective [19], [20]. As per the circuit arrangement catego-\nrization, the inverter can be a voltage source inverter (VSI)\nor current source inverter (CSI) type. V oltage source inverter\nestablishes voltage with requisite magnitude, frequency and\nphase [21] with very low internal impedance. In this research\naspect, the VSI design is considered a high-quality contender\nwhich is ultimately preferred. Three phase VSI consists of\nthree half bridges similar valued component conﬁguration\nwhich are mutually phase shifted by 2π /3 rad (or 120 0) to\nproduce three phase voltage waves [22].\nThe most momentous aspects (i.e. switch count and lower\nswitch losses) regarding SST function are marked at the\nexpense of inadequate and scarce functionalities in a single\nstage topology. In an illustration, the existence of DC link\nresults in decoupling of the input from the output, thereby\nallowing reactive power support to grid along with input\nvoltage sag ride through. For improvement of lower volt-\nage direct current (LVDC) link voltage regulation, the extra\nDC link on three stages (ﬁve blocks) SST arrangement in\ncomparison to two-stage SST is deﬁnitely used which is\nmaterialized by transferring the 120Hz voltage ripples on the\nhigh voltage direct current (HVDC) link. In analysis, a three-\nstage conﬁguration containing dual half bridge (DHB) or dual\nactive bridge (DAB) seems to be the most viable and\npracticable solution for SST realization, primarily because\nof its capability, potential in sustaining and withstanding\nthe whole possible functionalities to be anticipated in a\nSST arrangement [23]. SST in future renewable elec-\ntric energy delivery and management (FREEDM) system\nwill undertake two functions, which include: (1) delivery/\ntransmission of energy to loads/consumers and (2) integra-\ntion of the distributed renewable energy sources & energy\nstorage devices. Fig-1 consists of a rectiﬁer stage, trans-\nformer isolated DC–DC converter stage and lastly a low\nfrequency inverter stage. From operation point of view, as per\ncalculation subsequently, the rectiﬁer interfaced with the\n11-kV-electric utility grid is utilized to facilitate the func-\ntion of power factor correction whilst converting 11kV ac\ninto 15kVdc. The DC–DC converter being a focal and main\nstage of SST, establishes galvanic isolation with high fre-\nquency while converting 15kVdc at its input to 450-V dc\nat output. The 450-V dc is utilized further to interface the\ndc loads, the distributed renewable energy sources and the\ndistributed energy storage devices. The low voltage recti-\nﬁer is incorporated to convert this 450V dc at its input\nVOLUME 7, 2019 140153\nA. Rehman, M. Ashraf: Design and Analysis of PWM Inverter for 100KVA SST in a Distribution System\ninto 380/240V ac for end-use applications. Planar trans-\nformer incorporating PCB windings (conﬁgured in an inter-\nleaved structure) contributes in lowering core losses, winding\nlosses and solid isolation. Moreover, from many types of\nSMPS transistors, historically high voltage with deﬁnite high\ncurrent but low switching frequencies favor IGBTs [24].\nUnbalanced loads have been a source of problem for\nAC systems since the beginning of three phase AC systems.\nThey result in higher power losses and also lower operating\nconditions. Likewise, the latest developments in high power\nsemiconductor technology has made it possible to develop\nhigh power electronic switches (e.g. MOSFETS, IGBTs,\nIGCTs etc.) which are widely used in power conversion\ncircuits. Due to these power converters, including Switch\nMode Power Supplies (SMPS) and V oltage Source Convert-\ners (VSC), the nonlinear loads are increasing rapidly in all\nresidential, commercial and industrial installations. Despite\ntheir beneﬁts, these power converters are responsible for\nthe generation of immense harmonics; they cause poor dis-\nplacement factor; and result in negative sequence currents in\npower systems. All these factors are severely affecting the\nexisting power grid as they cause power quality problems and\nalso affect the operational life of electrical equipment. For\nexample, due to harmonic problem the de-rating of standard\ntransformers is up to 50%. Therefore, in this paper a design\nand analysis of a 3-phase PWM Inverter using half–bridge\ntopology for 11kV/381V , 100kV A solid-state transformer\n(SST) is presented for power distribution system application.\nA mathematical model of SST is developed using analytical\ncalculations and then design of PWM inverter implemented\nin MATLAB simulation program. Lastly it is also realized in\nhardware laboratory perspective for a half-bridge conﬁgura-\ntion in downscaled values.\nII. MAJOR COMPONENTS OF SST\nA. NECESSITY OF DC-DC CONVERTER\n100 KV A Solid State Transformer is designed to replace a\n50Hz distribution transformer which is an electrical isola-\ntion transformer to convert high-voltage electricity to lower\nvoltage levels acceptable for use in homes and business.\nA distribution transformer’s function is to step down the\nvoltage and provide isolation between primary and secondary.\nIt consists of primary and secondary windings on a common\ncore which are coupled by electromagnetic induction. This\ncoupling by an electromagnetic ﬁeld, rather than a direct\ncopper circuit, is called ‘galvanic isolation’. It is a much safer\nscenario than direct connection and reduces the chances of\nelectric shock or dangerous sparking discharge. The use of\nan isolation transformer is one of the most common methods\napplicable to both electrical safety and operational efﬁciency.\nUnder these circumstances, the isolated DC-DC converter is\ndesigned [25].\nB. NARRATION OF DC-DC CONVERTER\nPrimary aim of DC-DC converter segment in SST fabrication\nis to facilitate galvanic isolation between medium voltage\nFIGURE 2. Transformer Isolated DC-DC converter [26].\ncontrol (MVC) & low voltage control (LVC), and then pro-\nvide a comparison of DC voltage levels to the established\nvalues required by the respective modules [26]. Fig-2 exhibits\nblock diagram of isolated DC-DC converter. In the light\nof increased quantity of distributed generation units, the\nDC-DC converter as a module should be able to handle efﬁ-\ncient energy transfer, whilst maintaining as high efﬁciency as\nachievable. Moreover, the usage of medium frequency trans-\nformer deﬁnitely contributes towards the basic advantage in\nreduction of core size and thus on the whole volume size [27].\nThere are two types of conﬁgurations who can fulﬁl these\nnecessities explicitly, are Dual Active Bridge (DAB) and Dual\nHalf Bridge (DHB). DAB contains two full bridges connected\nby means of medium frequency transformer whereas a DHB\ncomprises of two half bridges connected by MF transformer.\nThe core circuit for high frequency link power conversion\nsystem relating to high efﬁciency and galvanic isolation is\nthe isolated DC-DC converter. For high power conversion,\na dual active bridge (DAB) DC-DC converter is considered\nto be the most appropriate and promising solution. The iso-\nlated DC-DC converter as an entity of SST makes use of a\nPWM Inverter at the primary side of the MF transformer for\nthe purpose of production of ac voltage. The transformer iso-\nlated converters (DAB or DHB) are used predominantly for\nprovision of galvanic isolation, augment safety, boost noise\nimmunity and prevent the transmission of voltage transients\nto the output. Therefore, DC-DC converters in transformer\nisolation scenario are taken into appraisal. With ongoing\ntechnological advancement in power electronics, the research\nin this ﬁeld is very active and updated; where a number of\nresearch papers and articles are published as evident from\npapers as referenced as [18], [26]–[33].\nC. TOPOLOGY SELECTION AND ANALYSIS\nHalf Bridge in DHB and Full Bridge in DAB are two pop-\nular and well accepted conﬁgurations for the fabrication\nof converters in phase shift dual bridge DC-DC converter.\nFig-3 and Table-1 facilitate the comparison of the oper-\national conditions of these two types of converter which\nhighlight that (1) in half bridge of DHB arrangement, the\ntransformer ﬂux swing is merely half to that of the full bridge\nin DAB arrangement if the same transformer effective cross\nsectional area and switching frequency are used. (2) In a\nhalf bridge of DHB entails half the number of switching\ndevices and of course the corresponding drivers’ comparison\nto DAB. Ultimately this peculiarity contributes towards more\ncheap and inexpensive solution. In this scenario, half bridge\n140154 VOLUME 7, 2019\nA. Rehman, M. Ashraf: Design and Analysis of PWM Inverter for 100KVA SST in a Distribution System\nTABLE 1. Comparison of HB (DHB) and (FB)DAB [34].\nFIGURE 3. Comparison between full bridge in DAB and half bridge\nin DHB [34].\nas a part of the phase shift DHB is given preference for\nanalysis [34].\nThe Power Output of phase-shift DHB may be articulated\nas:\nPout =\nn\n(\nVin\n2\n)(\nVout\n2\n)\nϕ(π−|ϕ|)\n2π2fL\n(1)\nHere L speciﬁes total leakage inductance of transformer with\nan external auxiliary inductance, whereas ϕis the indication\nof phase-shift angle. The V out is assumed to be equivalent\nto nV in. In this back-ground, the output current, I out may be\nspeciﬁed as:\nIout =Pout\nVout\n=nVinϕ(π−|ϕ|)\n8π2fL (2)\nThe above stated current expression illustrates that the I out is\nnot dependent on the output voltage, V out. This exceptional\ncurrent source discriminates DHB arrangement from the\nbuck-derived DC–DC converters. It is an important advantage\nfor this arrangement. On an extensive wide load range operat-\ning on kilo-hertz frequency ranges, a higher competency can\nbe obtained. In that scenario, the output power can be given\nby:\nPout =V 2\nin∅(5−|∅|)\n8π2fL (3)\nwhere ∅denotes phase shift range (−π /2 to π/2). It must be\nillustrious that the values of ∅and L contribute in controlling\nthe converter output power with adaptive inductor whereas\nthe φonly control the DHB converter output power with ﬁxed\ninductor. If EL stands for energy storage in commutation\ninductor for every transition period, (which is taken as half\nof the circulating energy E C), then it can be mathematically\nexpressed as:\nEL =Ec\n2 = Pout φ\n4f (5−|∅| (4)\nTo maintain switching devices ZVS operation, E C(the circu-\nlating energy) is utilized in discharge of the output capac-\nitance C 0 of the switching devices whereas the circulating\nenergy (EC) is not supposed to be lower than the total capac-\nitor energy, [i.e. E C ≥Eth].\nIII. DESIGN OF SOLID STATE TRANSFORMER [SST]\nA. OVERVIEW\nAn ordinary power plant generates voltages at a\nrate 11kV/13kV . The preference is given to produce volt-\nage from 11kV/13kV to 132kV or 220kV and further\nto 500kV or even greater, using step up transformer to\naddress losses in transmission at a distant end. Electric power\nof 11 kV supply is provided at the consumers locations and\nat light industry in this region. 11kV transformer plays a\nvital and momentous role in power distribution at consumer\nend, whereas the transmission levels are 500kV , 220kV\nand 132kV . Fig-4 illustrates an overview of centralized\npower network highlighting its transmission and distribu-\ntion/circulation in our scenario [35].\nB. MATHEMATICAL MODEL OF SST\nConsider Solid-State Transformer with three stages\n(i.e. rectiﬁer stage, isolation stage and then inverter stage.)\nfor evaluation as mathematical modeling and further analysis.\nHere ﬁrstly, three-phase pulse width modulation (PWM) rec-\ntiﬁer converts grid voltages (three-phase) into corresponding\nDC voltage. The obtained DC voltage is then transformed\ninto high frequency square wave with help of PWM inverter.\nThe transformed high frequency square wave at medium\nfrequency (MF) transformer secondary is again rectiﬁed with\nhelp of uncontrolled diode rectiﬁer. Later on, the obtained\nDC voltage is routed to the low frequency output inverter,\nwhich converts DC into low frequency AC. Fig-5 illustrates\na three stage SST conﬁguration and Fig-6 is the detailed\nstructure of Solid State Transformer for evaluation of mathe-\nmatical model.\nThe voltage equations regarding rectiﬁer stage, isolation\nstage and output low frequency inverter stage of SST arrange-\nment are appended as [33]:\n\n\nVa (t)\nVb (t)\nVc (t)\n\n=\n√\n2 Vs\n\n\nsin ωt\nsin (ωt −120)\nsin (ωt +120)\n\n(5) (5)\n\n\nVla (t)\nVlb (t)\nVlc (t)\n\n=m1Vdc\n\n\nsin (ωt −θ1)\nsin (ωt −120 −θ1)\nsin (ωt +120 −θ1)\n\n (6)\n\n\nVoa (t)\nVob (t)\nVoc (t)\n\n=m2Vdc\n\n\nsin (ωt −θ2)\nsin (ωt −120 −θ2)\nsin (ωt +120 −θ3)\n\n (7)\nVOLUME 7, 2019 140155\nA.

STAGE WISE PARAMETER CALCULATION OF SST\nThe ﬁrst and former step to replace 11KV/381V , 100KV A\nconventional Line Frequency (distribution) Transformer to a\nthree stage SST is the stage-wise parameter analysis of three\nstages SST.\n1) PROPOSED METHOD-1\nIn this proposal, a PWM inverter (FB) at the primary of\nMF Transformer and low frequency inverter (FB) at the\nsecondary of MF Transformer are considered. The stage-wise\nanalysis is given in Fig-7.\nMathematical analysis of Fig-7 reveals that using Full\nBridge (FB) topology at PWM inverter and also full bridge\n(FB) at low frequency(LF) inverter, in analysis for research,\nthe output voltage of PWM inverter comes to 10.253kV with\n6x bridges conﬁguration utilizing 24 transistors as switching\ndevices. In further elaboration, during the forward direction\n(as indicated by arrow head), the input voltage to the SST\nis 11KV . Since SST has been divided into ﬁve blocks,\nﬁrstly this 11 KV voltage is rectiﬁed by rectiﬁer stage and\nat the output of rectiﬁer (through mathematical formulae)\n15 KV DC voltages is achieved at the input of PWM inverter.\nPWM inverter is in full bridge conﬁguration (containing\n4x transistors per bridge). The line voltage at the output\ncomes to 10.3 KV . In the reverse direction from the end block\n(as indicated by arrow head) (i.e.LF inverter), the output\nvoltage of 380V is produced, which contributes to line to\nline peak voltage (DC voltage) of 600V . This 600V DC is\nfed to rectiﬁer (4 th block) of isolated DC-DC converter.\nThe ac voltage (line to line) of this rectiﬁer is calculated\nas 450V .

The detail block-wise analysis is\nshown in Fig-8.\nAnalysis of Fig-8 reveals the arrangement of using half\nbridge topology PWM inverter at input and full bridge topol-\nogy LF inverter at output of MF transformer. To our anxiety,\nthe output voltage of half bridge inverter comes to 3.89 kV\nutilizing 6 transistors as switching devices. Initially, the input\n15 kV to the high frequency inverter will be distributed in\nthree bridges, where every bridge will contain 2x high power\ncapacitors. Each capacitor will hold 2.5 kV; one capacitor will\nbe used for positive half cycle, whereas 2 nd one for negative\nhalf cycle. Further in elaboration, in the forward direction\n(as indicated by arrow head), the input voltage to the SST\nis 11KV . SST has been divided into ﬁve blocks. Firstly this\n11 KV voltage is rectiﬁed by rectiﬁer block and at the output\nof rectiﬁer (through mathematical formulae) 15 KV DC volt-\nages is achieved which is at the input of the PWM inverter.\nPWM inverter is in half bridge conﬁguration. The phase\nvoltage at the output comes to 2250V and correspondingly the\nline voltage becomes 3.89KV . In the reverse direction from\nthe end block(as indicated by arrow head) (i.e. LF inverter),\nthe output product is 380V , which contributes to line to line\npeak voltage (DC voltage) of 600V . This 600V DC is fed\nto rectiﬁer (4th block) of isolated DC-DC converter. The ac\nvoltage (line to line) of this rectiﬁer calculated as 1555.6V .\nNow in the middle block (i.e. MFT), the input is 3.89KV and\nOutput is 1555.6V . Using voltage and turn ratio relationship\n(NPVP =NSVS), the turn ratio becomes 2.5:1 (step down).\n3) PROPOSED METHOD-3\nIn this scenario, a proposal is made to incorporate a PWM\ninverter (in HB scenario) at the primary of MF transformer\nand Low Frequency inverter (in HB) at the secondary of\nMF Transformer. The detail analysis is shown in Fig-9.\nFig-9 depicts the use of HB topology at PWM inverter as\nwell as at low frequency inverter. To our interest, the output\nvoltage of half bridge PWM inverter comes to 3.89 KV with\n3x bridges conﬁguration utilizing 6 transistors as switch-\ning devices. The input 15 KV to the PWM inverter will\nbe distributed in three bridges, where every bridge will\ncontain 2xhigh power capacitors as per practice. In elab-\noration, in the forward direction (as indicated by arrow\nhead), the input voltage to the SST is 11KV . SST has\nbeen divided into ﬁve blocks.

COMPARISON BETWEEN FULL BRIDGE INVERTER\nAND HALF BRIDGE INVERTER\nPWM inverter consists of mainly two arrangements in\nbridge perspective: (1) Full-bridge high voltage inverters and\n(2) Half-bridge high voltage inverters. In inverter design\nscenario, these two arrangements are evaluated in the light\nof their performance parameters such as cost, size, current\nripple/total harmonic distortion(THD), transformer turn ratio,\nswitching power Loss etc. The most promising and key differ-\nence between a half-bridge and full bridge arrangements lie\nin the measurement of output voltage. For half bridge conﬁg-\nuration, in a single phase, it contains two switches and each\nof its capacitor has an output voltage equal to half the supply\nvoltage (i.e. Vout=Vs\n2 ). In addition, the switches complement\neach other i.e. if one is switched ON, the other one goes OFF.\nIn case of full-bridge design, it is the same output voltage\nas the dc supply voltage (i.e. Vout=Vs). Table 3 depicts\nperformance parameters of FB and HB inverter design and\ncompares operational conditions, whereas Fig-10 illustrates\ntheir structural design.\nFor design of Full Bridge Inverter (1ϕ ), four choppers\nare used where when two transistors are turned ON simul-\ntaneously, the input voltage V dc, is appeared across the load\n(i.e.Vo =Vdc). Similarly, when other two transistors in bridge\nare turned ON at the same time, the voltage across the load\nappeared as inverted/reversed (i.e. V 0 =-Vdc). [39].\nFor analysis and design, IGBTs are used as a switches.\nThe inverter basically contains a power circuit and\nVOLUME 7, 2019 140159\nA. Rehman, M.

FB inverter VS HB inverter, (1ϕ ). [40], [41].\nPWM control circuit to generate the gate pulses to trigger\nthe IGBTs. According to the duty cycle of the gate pulses,\nthese IGBTs can be turn on and off. PWM plays a vital role\nin controlling power electronic controller such as rectiﬁers,\nDC-DC converter, inverter etc. Some of the advantages the\nPWM technique offers as the power loss are very low in\nthe switching devices coupled with less generated noise and\nminimization of harmonics. Moreover the output voltage can\nbe easily controlled.\nSimilarly, for HB Inverter (1ϕ), when only one transistor is\nturned ON for half of time period, the instantaneous voltage\nobserved across the load equals, V 0 =Vs/2. Correspond-\ningly if only other transistor is taken into operation for half\nof time period, then the voltage appears across the load\nis V 0 =−Vs/2. A three-phase inverter can be designed\nonce three single phase half (or full) bridge inverters are\nconnected in parallel as shown in Fig-10 (a), (b). In addi-\ntion, there are two mainly employed inverter technologies\nin Power System applications, which are PWM inverter\nand Resonant Inverter. PWM Inverters regulate by adjusting\nthe ‘‘ON-time’’ of the transistor in controlling the width\nof the pulses in the switching arrangement scenario and\nare used for the variable load. The resonant inverters are\nTABLE 4. PWM inverter design parameters.\nelectrical converters based on resonant current oscillation and\nare used for ﬁxed load (i.e. ideally suited for constant load\npower) applications. Main function of these inverters is to\nreduce switching losses of the devices. Variable load inverters\n(i.e. PWM inverter) offer many advantages, which includes\n(1) Very low power loss in switching devices with less gener-\nated noise. (2) Minimization of harmonics and controllability\nof output voltage [40], [41]. Table-4 shows the various param-\neters of the proposed inverter design, whereas its pictorial\ndesign is depicted in Fig-11.Table-5 accumulates the output\ndata and Table-6 carries the miscellaneous calculations\nV. MEDIUM FREQUENCY TRANSFORMER DESIGN\nMedium-frequency power transformer (MFPT) is taken as\none of the key and signiﬁcant rudiments of a high-power\nisolated DC-DC converter in power applications such as the\nfuture all-DC offshore wind farms, tractions and solid-state\ntransformers.\nA. DESIGN CONSIDERATION\nIn SST application, transformer is lighter in weight with\nsmaller size as compared to the existed line frequency trans-\nformer. There are two key devise issues of medium frequency\ntransformer which are inductance optimization and high volt-\nage insulation. To address the inductance requirement issue,\na high value leakage inductance with respect to switching\nfrequency of converter is incorporated for proper operation\n140160 VOLUME 7, 2019\nA.

The sec-\nond requirement of high voltage isolation is catered by FEM\n(Finite Element Method) analysis. Several materials can be\nconsidered in transformer design in high power and high\nfrequency perspective, including ferrite, Nano-crystalline and\namorphous [42], [43]. A few types of core material charac-\nteristics are brieﬂy summarized in Table 6. Ferrite core has\nVOLUME 7, 2019 140161\nA. Rehman, M. Ashraf: Design and Analysis of PWM Inverter for 100KVA SST in a Distribution System\nTABLE 7. Core material specifications [43].\nexperienced with low loss quality coupled with low saturation\nﬂux density (0.4T). Therefore, it is considered appropriate for\napplications and uses, where operating frequencies exist in\nthe assortment of tens to hundreds of Kilohertz.\nB. MULTI-LAYER PCB APPROACH\nHigher power density with a lower proﬁle in regards to\nMF transformer design can be achieved, provided a planar\ntransformer is encased using coils inside and within mul-\ntilayer printed circuit board (PCB) as compared to con-\nventional wire-wound transformer, particularly in manifold\nmodule system applications. In this approach transformer\nwindings are etched within the PCB and therefore are totally\nreoccurring. For reduction of corona and partial discharge,\nthe solid insulation excluding air is utilized by the planar\ntransformer so that SST liability can be improved.\nC. TRANSFORMER CORE LOSSES\nThe core loss may be premeditated using following empirical\nrelationship:\nPcl =VeCmfxBy\nac (16)\nwhere: Ve illustrates the transformer effective core volume;\nCm, x, and y are the dealt as coefﬁcients related to the core\nmaterial; B ac represents the maximum ﬂux density and is\narticulated as\nBac= VTD\n2NpAef (17)\nHere, N p indicates the number of primary turns and VT\nstands for applied voltage on the primary side of transformer.\nIt has been noticed earlier that in case of DAB arrangement,\nVT(OUT) =Vin and for DHB (Half Bridge) arrangement\nVT(OUT) =Vin/2. It is also validated that the converter with\nHB arrangement possesses much lower core loss as com-\npared to the converter with full bridge conﬁguration whilst\nincorporating the same switching frequency as well as the\nsame transformer core effective cross-sectional area. Such\nfact has been veriﬁed from prototype transformer whose\ndeliberated core loss at 176 0F (80 0C) in regards to VT and\nf reveals that (1) for high frequency (i.e.50 kHz) operation,\nthe core loss for DAB with V T =500V is almost 10.56W;\nwhere as in case of DHB the core loss with V T =250\nis 1.778W. It must be noted that the frequency and voltage are\ninversely proportional to each other; hence lower the core loss\nis [9], [44].\nFIGURE 11. Proposed inverter design.\nD.
