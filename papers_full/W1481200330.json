    "abstract": "Eight different polymer binders were formulated with bimodal distributions of 2,6-diamino-3,5-dinitropyrazine-1-oxide (LLM-105) in 5/95 weight ratio of polymer to explosive at the 25 gram level. The polymers evaluated included: Kel-F 800, Viton A, Oxy 461, Cytop A, Hyflon AD 60, Hytemp 5545, Technoflon PFR 91 and Technoflon P 459. LLM-105 had an average particle size of 35.6 {+-} 0.6 {micro}m. This material was ground in a ball mill for 24 h to achieve a particle size of 0.72 {+-} 0.02 {micro}m. Small angle light scattering measurements were used to obtain particle size distributions on both ground and unground LLM-105. Optical microscopy was used to characterize the morphology of the crystals. Bimodal mixes of approximately 75/25% coarse to fine LLM-105 were used in all formulations. Cylinders 1.27 cm diameter by 2.54 cm long were compression molded using 3 three-minute cycles at 105 C, except in the case of Cytop and Hyflon formulations which were molded at {approx}130 C. Densities varied between 94-98% of theoretical maximum. Stress strain measurements were made in compression at -30, ambient and 74 C at a strain rate of 0.0001 sec{sup -1}. As expected, the mechanical strength scaled with temperature depending on the glass transition temperature of the polymer.",
