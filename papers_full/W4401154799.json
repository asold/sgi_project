  "abstract": "Abstract Importance In mental healthcare, the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance psychoeducation is a burgeoning field. This study explored the potential of ChatGPT as an individualized psychoeducational support tool specifically for psychosis education. Objective The study aims to evaluate psychosis-related questions to provide accurate, clear, and clinically relevant individualized information for patients and caregivers. Design This cross-sectional study uses a qualitative analysis design. The researchers specifically employed a question-answering system (GPT-4 via ChatGPT) to generate responses to common questions about psychosis. Experts in the field then evaluated these responses to assess their quality for use in a clinical setting. Primary Outcome Researchers presented ChatGPT with 20 common questions frequently asked by patients’ caregivers and relatives. Two experts in psychosis then assessed the quality of the responses using six criteria: accuracy (1-3), clarity (1-3), inclusivity (1-3), completeness (0-1), clinical utility (1-5) and an overall score (1-4). Results The evaluation yielded positive results overall. Responses were rated as accurate (M±SD= 2.89±0.22) and clear (mean score of 2.93±0.18). There was potential for improvement in terms of inclusivity (mean score of 2.30±0.41), suggesting a need to incorporate more diverse perspectives. Completeness received high ratings (mean score of 0.93±0.18), indicating responses addressed all aspects of the questions. Most importantly, the responses were deemed clinically useful (mean score of 4.35±0.52). Conclusions In summary, this study underscores the significant promise of ChatGPT as a psychoeducational tool for patients with psychosis, their relatives, and their caregivers. The experts’ findings affirm that the information delivered by ChatGPT is not only accurate and clinically relevant but also conveyed conversationally, enhancing its accessibility and usability. The initial performance of ChatGPT as a psychoeducational tool in the context of psychosis education is undeniably positive.",
