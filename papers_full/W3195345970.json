Two basic techniques of mechanical \nrock mining can be distinguished by means of disc tools, \nnamely excavation with static pressure and undercutting \n(Fig. 1). The use of disc tools allows, compared to the stand-\nard mining method, to reduce the energy consumption of the \nmining process and leads to the reduction of dust generation \nassociated with mining. Due to the significant reduction of \nfriction forces in the rock-mining process, the abrasion wear \nof cutting tools is also increasing. However, the undercutting \nmethod provides the theoretical benefit of reducing mining \nforces compared to mining with conventional symmetrical \ndisc tools. Since this cutting action generates tensile stresses \nin the rock much more directly than the conventional tech-\nnique, it is far more efficient, meaning that the force required \nto break the rock is much lower (Ramezanzadeh et al. 2010). \nThe above advantages of using disc tools resulted that over \nthe past decades, many attempts of industrial application of \nasymmetric disc tools have been undertaken. Disc tools were \nused in the simple and complex kinematics of the work -\ning system (Weber 1995; Jeong et al. 2019). Attempts are \nmade to apply disc tools not only on conceptual (prototype) \nmachines but also in industrial ones that have used the stand-\nard mining tools (picks, teeth) (Asbury et al. 1998; Gosp-\nodarczyk et al. 2013; Acaroglu et al. 2017).\nModelling and research in applying asymmetrical disc \ntools in mechanical excavation systems are one of the pri-\nmary research directions implemented at the Department \nof Machinery Engineering and Transport at AGH UST in \n * Grzegorz Stopka \n stopka@agh.edu.pl\n1 Department of Machinery Engineering and Transport \nMachines, AGH University of Science and Technology, al. \nMickiewicza 30, 30-059 Kraków, Poland\n6266 G. Stopka \n1 3\nKrakow, Poland (Bołoz 2018; Gospodarczyk et al. 2016; \nKotwica 2018). An example of this type of work is develop-\ning and implementing a new generation of disc head dedi-\ncated for use in the construction of roadheaders. The disc \nhead concept assumes the mining of rock stone by chipping \nas a result of a complex trajectory of disc tools. It is pre-\nsented in Fig.  2. The elaborated mining unit consists of an \nindependently propelled body and mounted in it propelled \ndiscs with asymmetrical disc tools. Unit body 1 is propelled \nby an external drive shaft 2. In the body, in seats 3 drive \nshafts 6 are mounted with plates 4, on which in bearing seats \n10 disc tools 5 are installed. The most favourable number \nof the tools should be 6–8 pieces. The drive shafts 6 are \npropelled by an internal drive shaft 7 independent from the \nexternal drive shaft 2 and a set of bevel gears 8 and 9 or \nalternative ones. The mining head’s presented design with \ndisc tools has been successfully verified in series of field \ntests. The field tests showed correct kinematics of the mining \nprocess. In the conclusions of the tests, it was emphasised \nthat a roadheader using a mining head with disc tools needed \nonly about 60% of the power compared to a conventional \nmining head.\nHowever, this type of innovative application of asym-\nmetric disc tools requires the use of proven calculation pro-\ncedures to verify the reliability of such new mining system’s \nsolutions. The reason for this is the complex process of rock \ndestruction during rock cutting by disc tools. The essence \nof destroying the cohesion of rocks by disc tool in a simpli-\nfied way can be illustrated using the example of the wedge \nprofile’s penetration into rock half-space. A characteristic \nfeature of this process is the relatively small size of the so-\ncalled compression zone. Therefore, the foremost part of \nthe excavated material during the disc mining is the volume \nof side fragments. The course of penetration of the wedge \nprofile into a half-space is characterised by dynamic vari-\nability, which directly affects the pressing force’s value dur-\ning mining. The consequence of this fact is the difficulty of \nformulating a full mathematical description of the process \nof disc’s blade penetration into the rock body. In connec-\ntion with the above, models specifying the mining resistance \nforces assume simplifications and allow only for an approx-\nimate estimation of forces acting on the tool during rock \nexcavation. It should be emphasised that the computational \nmodels of different authors are most often the result of their \nexperimental research. Therefore, they are valid in the area \nof restrictions that were considered during the experiment. \nThe analytical formulas for describing the resistance forces \nof disc mining assume simple kinematics of the mining sys-\ntem (most often rectilinear). The use of analytical formulas \nfor calculating disc tool loads is often insufficient. It is pos-\nsible to generate errors when defining boundary conditions \nfor new and innovative types of mining machinery (Stopka \n2019, 2020).\nThe fundamental problem in the design of work systems \nwith asymmetric disc tools is the lack of adequate analytical \nFig. 1  Conventional disc cutting (left) and undercutting (right) \n(Ramezanzadeh et al. 2010)\nFig. 2  Conception of a unit \nequipped with asymmetric disc \ntools of a complex motion tra-\njectory (left) and the prototype \n(right)\n\n6267Modelling of Rock Cutting with Asymmetrical Disc Tool Using Discrete-Element Method (DEM)  \n1 3\nmodels to identify tool loads during the mining process. \nOne reasonable approach is to use computer simulation. \nHowever, simulation of the process of rock destruction by \ntool impact is a complex problem. Regardless of the choice \nof a numerical method, simulation of a process with such \ncomplex characteristics involves the need to identify many \nparameters of material and contact models. An additional \nproblem is the long computation time and the associated \nmodel accuracy. The characteristics of simulation models are \nnot universal but change with the characteristics of the min-\ning process and the geometry of a tool. Previous experience \nof the research team from the Department of Mechanical \nEngineering and Transport of the AGH University of Sci-\nence and Technology in Cracow from design works and tests \nof the new generation disc head pointed to a big problem \nin the scope of modelling mining with asymmetrical disc \ntools. This applies especially to the optimization of numeri-\ncal models in terms of calculation time and accuracy.\nTaking the above into consideration, the DEM model of \nasymmetric disc–rock interaction was developed as a part \nof the research being the subject of this paper. The aim of \nmodel tests was to demonstrate the adequacy of applied \nmodel with respect to laboratory tests, assuming certain \nnumerical parameters of the DEM model, which signifi-\ncantly affect the computation time (linear model of the par -\nticle–particle contact, maximisation of the DEM particle \nradius).\nIn view of the objective adopted, it was assumed that \nthe tests would be carried out assuming simple mining kin-\nematics with an asymmetric disc tool. Therefore, the tests \nconsisted of simulating the pressing of an asymmetrical disc \ninto a rock sample. This approach allowed for the evalua-\ntion of approximate loads on the disc head, and at the same \ntime, ensured that the models could be validated on a labora-\ntory bench with sufficiently high accuracy of tool position-\ning relative to the sample. The independent variables in the \nstudy were: disc diameter (D  = 150 and 160 mm), mining \npitch (t = 15–25 mm), mechanical properties of rock samples \n(concrete, sandstone). To evaluate the accuracy of developed \nDEM models, the maximum destruction force and the size \nof the destruction zone were calculated for each test, and \nthe measured parameters were compared with the results of \nlaboratory tests.\n2  General Approach to Rock Cutting \nModelling\nNowadays, computer technology development provides the \ncapability of rock-cutting simulation using various mod-\nelling techniques, such as the Discrete-Element Method \n(DEM) or Finite-Element Method (FEM). To extend \nthe possibilities of modelling the rock–tool interaction, \nit is also possible to combine both numerical methods \n(FEM–DEM) (Zárate at el. 2015).\nThe Finite-Element Method (FEM) is one of the numer -\nical methods that can analyse complex engineering prob-\nlems. Due to a large number of material models and failure \ncriteria, the FEM can be used to modelling rock–tool inter -\naction (Li et al. 2012a, b). The basic approach to model-\nling rock cutting in FEM is based on using the Mohr–Cou-\nlomb failure criteria or similar models. The most advanced \napproach in rock-cutting modelling in FEM is related to \nthe use of the Concrete Damage model, Johnson Hol-\nmquist Concrete model, or the Continuous Surface Cap \nmodel (CSCM) implemented in LS-Dyna software (Jaime \net al. 2015). The use of the above models in the FEM \nallows simulation of rock’s cracks and fragmentation.\nThe second numerical method that can be used to simu-\nlate rock cutting is the DEM. The discrete-element method \n(DEM) is a particle-based numerical method that can \nmodel a system’s mechanical behaviour composed of an \nassembly of discrete spherical particles. The method mod-\nels part composed of rigid spheres that can move indepen-\ndently and interact with one another. According to numer -\nous studies, the DEM provides a better understanding of \nthe mechanical behaviour of rocks and rock masses. It \nhas been proven as an efficient and economical method to \ngive a useful insight into rock fragmentation and fracture \nformation under complex load conditions (Zhang. et al. \n2020). During the past decade, numerical simulations of \nrock cutting with the use of the DEM have been carried \nout by many researchers. The largest research group was \nresearch focussed on simulation rock cutting with conical \npicks (Rojek at el. 2011; Qianqian at el. 2015; Zhang at el. \n2020). The DEM has also been used to simulate rock cut-\nting by disc tool, especially for disc tools used in full-face \ntunnel boring machines (TBM). Researchers conducted \nDEM simulations of rock cutting subjected to symmetrical \ndisc tools to study the rock fragmentation and its relation \nto applied cutting force (Rojek 2007; Li et al. 2012b, Li \nand Du 2016, Labra at el. 2017, Xia at el. 2017).\nHowever, there is no comprehensive modelling and \nlaboratory research in the literature on asymmetrical disc \ntools. Therefore, due to the development of the new gen-\neration of disc head, it was decided to develop simulation \nDEM models that would allow identifying loads of a sin-\ngle asymmetrical disc tool. The purpose of the research \nwas also to validate the model and its optimization due \nto the time of calculations. The discrete-element method \n(DEM) in LS-DYNA was employed to investigate the disc \ntool–rock interaction. The implementation of the DEM \nin the LS-Dyna program has been used many times in \nresearch on the dynamic behaviour of materials (Kara-\njan at el. 2012; Flores-Johnson at el. 2016; Takeda at el. \n2018).\n6268 G. Stopka \n1 3\n3  Numerical Model of Rock Cutting \nby Asymmetrical Disc Tool\n3.1  Discrete‑Element Method in LS‑Dyna\nThe DEM implemented in LS-DYNA is based on the method \nfirst developed by Cundall and Strack (Cundall and Strack \n1979; Hallquist 2015 ). As usual for the DEM, a penalty-\nbased contact is used to capture the particle–particle and \nparticle–surface interaction. Figure  3 shows a schematic \ncontact interaction between two particles. This elastic con-\ntact model is defined with normal and tangential stiffness, \ndamping coefficients, static and rolling friction coefficients.\nNormal contact force is calculated as the following \nequations:\n where\nParameter d int defined the interaction distance with X i \ndentoing the coordinates of the ith particle. The normal \nspring constant Kn is defined as follows:\nwhere ki and ri are the compression moduli and radii of the \nith particle, respectively, and NORMK is a user-specified \nstiffness penalty parameter. The parameter ki = E i∕3(1 − 2vi) \nis in LS–DYNA form the user-specified particle’s Young’s \nmodulus E and the Poisson’s ration v (Karajan et al. 2012). \nThe tangential spring constant is given by\nwhere the default value of the stiffness parameter SHEARK \nis 2/7 (Karajan et al. 2012). The normal damping force is \ndefined as follows:\n(1)F n = K ndint,\n(2)dint = r1 + r2 + /uni007C.x/uni007C.xX 1 − X 2 /uni007C.x/uni007C.x.\n(3)Kn = k1 r1 k1 r1\nk1 r1 + k1 r1\nNORMK ,\n(4)Ks = KnSHEARK ,\n where the damping constant Dn is given by\nNDAMP is the normal damping parameter \n( 0 ≤ NDAMP ≤ 1) . The tangential damping force is defined \nin a similar way as Eq. (4) with TDAMP and K t being used \ninstead of NDAMP andKn , respectively.\nThe DEM method in LS-Dyna can also be used to model \nbrittle material fracture by bonding the loose DEM parti -\ncles. To simulate brittle material fracture, the parallel bond \nmethod (PBM) for DEM particles was implemented in LS-\nDyna. The essence of the method is shown in Fig. 4\nIn this method, all particles are linked to their neighbour-\ning particles through bonds. The properties of the bonds rep-\nresent the complete mechanical behaviour of solid mechan-\nics. Bonds can be broken under excessive load, which allows \nus to simulate the initiation and propagation of material frac-\nture. The properties of the bonds (DE BOND) are adjusted \nby assigning normal (PBN) and shear stiffness (PBS) and \nmaximum normal (PBN_S) and maximum shear stress \n(PBS_S) for bond rupture. The maximum gap between two \nparticles that are meant to be bonded can be prescribed via \nthe parameter MAXGAP. This gap is either a multiple of the \nsmallest radius of the two spheres, i.e. MAXGAP × min(r1, \nr2), or an absolute value for the gap, depending on MAX -\nGAP being greater or smaller than zero, respectively. Due to \nthe DEM is a fully dynamic formulation, damping is neces-\nsary to dissipate kinetic energy. In LS-Dyna bond model, the \nnumerical damping coefficient (ALPHA) is used to calculate \nthe damping force between particles that formed the bond. \nIn LS-Dyna, it can be any value between 0 and 1.\nWhere  r1 and  r2 are the radii of bonded spheres, ∆Fs and \n∆Fn are, respectively, shear and normal force increments \napplied within each time increment of the analysis.\n(5)Fndamp = D n ̇dint,\n(6)Dn = 2NDAMP\n/uni221A.s2m1 m2\nm1 + m2\nKn.\nFig. 3  Schematic representation of sphere–sphere interaction\nFig. 4  Basic parameters of bonded particles in LS-Dyna\n6269Modelling of Rock Cutting with Asymmetrical Disc Tool Using Discrete-Element Method (DEM)  \n1 3\nThe normal force between two bonded discrete elements \nwith radii r1 and r2 is calculated as follows:\nwhere\nThe shear force is calculated as follows:\nThe moments are calculated as follows:\nwhere\nSFA is a radius multiplier scaling the bond circular \ncross-section area by multiplying the minimum radius \namongst the two involved radii from two bonded spheres. \nBy adjusting the bond radius multiplier, it is possible to \nbond each particle to several other particles.\nFracture in the material will be initialised by bonds \nbreaking, where only a few broken bonds can be seen as \na micro-crack and when several more bonds are breaking \nthe evolution of a macro-crack (Ten at el. 2013). Strength \nPBN_S and PBS_S are the strength components of the bond, \nrespectively, for normal and shear direction. Normal direc-\ntion is the direction parallel to the bond cylinder axis, and \nthe Shear direction is perpendicular to that in all orienta-\ntions. The maximum normal and shear stress acting on the \nparallel bond are formulated as follows:\nIf the maximum normal stress exceed the normal strength \n( /u1D70Emax ≥ PBN _S ) or the maximum shear stress exceeds the \nsher strength ( /u1D70Fmax ≥ PBS_S ), the parallel bond breaks.\n(7)ΔFn = PBN/parenleft.s1r1 + r2\n/parenright.s1AΔun,\n(8)A = /u1D70Br2\neﬀ\n(9)reﬀ = min (r1 ,r2 )SFA.\n(10)ΔFs = PBS PBN/parenleft.s1r1 + r2\n/parenright.s1AΔus.\n(11)ΔM n = PBSJΔ/u1D703n\n(12)ΔM s = PBNIΔ/u1D703s,\n(13)J = /u1D70B\n2 reﬀ\n4\n(14)I = /u1D70B\n4 reﬀ\n4 .\n(15)/u1D70Emax = −Fn\nA +\n/uni007C.x/uni007C.xM s/uni007C.x/uni007C.xreﬀ\nI\n(16)/u1D70Fmax =\n/uni007C.x/uni007C.xFs/uni007C.x/uni007C.x\nA +\n/uni007C.x/uni007C.xM n/uni007C.x/uni007C.xreﬀ\nJ .\n3.2  Calibration of Material Models\nThe main assumption for the research was to use at least \nthe modelling of two types of rock samples. Therefore, \ncomputer simulation of rock cutting by asymmetrical disc \ntools was carried out on concrete and sandstone samples. \nIn the first step, laboratory tests for determining rock sam-\nple’s strength (UCS and BTS tests) were conducted. The \ntest results are presented in Table 1. As it is widely known, \nestablishing numerical and physical parameters of the DEM \nmodel is complex and cannot be derived from the labora-\ntory experiments directly. Therefore, the material’s macro- \nand micro-parameters must be calibrated by simulating the \nrock mechanical experiments. Numerical modelling in this \ninvestigation was mainly conducted by the use of DEM in \nLS-Dyna software. The micro- and macro-parameters are \ncalibrated by simulating both the UCS and BTS tests. There-\nfore, simulation tests were carried out for individual types \nof samples. Figure 5 illustrates the cylindrical model of con-\ncrete sample for the simulation of the UCS and BTS tests.\nThe basic independent variables in calibration tests were: \nradius of particles (RDES), the maximum gap between par-\nticles (MAXGAP), bond cross-section (A), particle stiff-\nness parameters  (Kn,  Ks), and bond stiffness parameters \n(PBN, PBS, PBN_S, PBS_S). In the first stage, the uniaxial \ncompression of rock samples was simulated. In the case of \nthe correct representation of the sample’s elastic proper -\nties and the maximum destructive force, in the next step, \nthe verification of the DEM model in the BTS tensile test \nwas conducted. In the case of a negative result in the BTS \ntest (inadequate parameters of the sample’s stiffness or the \ndestructive force), the base parameters were modified, and \nthe UCS and BTA tests were repeatedly verified. After the \ntesting stage aimed at verifying the DEM model in the USC \nand BTS tests, a control test with a disc tool was carried out \nat a mining pitch of t = 15 (short calculation time). Achiev-\ning an acceptable error (±  2RDES), in this case, meaning that \nthe disc tool tests could be continued for the remaining set \nof parameters (different values of disc diameter and cutting \npitch). The procedure was repeated until obtaining a posi-\ntive result in both strength tests. The calibration scheme is \npresented in Fig. 6.\nTable 1  Mechanical properties of rock samples\nParameter Concrete Sandstone\nDensity, kg/m3 2130 2450\nUniaxial compressive strength (UCS), MPa 23.7 78.8\nBrazilian tensile strength (BTS), MPa 2.3 5.7\nYoung’s modulus, GPa 1.6 9.2\nPoisson’s ratio [-] 0.275 0.21\n6270 G. Stopka \n1 3\nFigures  7 and 8  illustrate force–displacement relation-\nship obtained in laboratory tests of the unconfined compres-\nsion (UCS) and Brazilian tests (BTS) for concrete. These \ncurves allowed to determine the micro–macro-properties of \nthe material model with the discrete-element method. An \nimportant assumption was to determine the size of the par -\nticles that on the one hand, will guarantee the accuracy of \ncalculations, and on the other hand, will not generate long \nsimulation time for full-scale tests with disc tools. In the \nfollowing figures plotted, green curve are the results of simu-\nlation tests for calibrated models. The same calibration pro-\ncedure was conducted for sandstone. The calibration results \nfor both materials are summarised in Table 2.\n3.3  Testing Methodology\nSimulations of rock cutting by asymmetrical disc tools have \nbeen performed using the model shown in Fig. 9. Numerical \ntests were conducted by pushing the disc into a rock sample \nat a given distance from the sample edge until the material \nwas detached entirely. Based on the literature analysis of the \nsubject as well as the previous author experiences in the field \nof industrial application of disc tools, it has been determined \nthat the tests will be carried out changing geometric and \nprocess parameters, such as:\n– diameter of the disc tool D = 150 and 160 mm.\n– cut spacing t = 15, 20 and 25 mm.\n– mechanical properties of the rock sample (concrete, sand-\nstone)\nDuring simulation tests, the disc tools of blade angle 40° \nand tip radius R  = 1 mm have been considered. Based on \nprevious laboratory tests, the dimensions of the rock sam-\nple were determined. Observation of the mechanism of rock \ndestruction during mining tests with asymmetrical disc tools \nallowed to establish the required dimensions of the rock \nmodel, that is illustrated in Fig. 9.\nSimulations of the mining process with asymmetrical disc \ntools have been carried out using LS-Dyna software. The \nvirtual 3D model of disc tools and rock samples has been \ndiscretised in the next step. The disc tool has been discre-\ntised with over 188.000 triangular elements, considering a \nrefinement in the disc tip to reproduce its curvature (Fig. 10). \nThe disc tool was treated as a rigid body with a prescribed \ntranslational motion perpendicular to the rock sample. To \ndefine the disc tool movement, a constant velocity was \nimposed. The constant velocity was equal to 0.03 m/s for \nconcrete samples and 0.01 m/s for sandstone samples. These \nparameters were established based on the basis of pilot disc \nmining tests. Characterisation of the particle assembly for \nthe test with disc tools is presented in Table 3.\nThe results of model discretization in LS-Dyna DEM \ncode are shown in Fig.  10. The DEM particles were set in \ncontact with the disc with the use of the contact Node to \nSurface Contact. The static and dynamic friction coefficient \nwas set to 0.3. During simulation tests, displacement of the \nbackside and right side of the sample was fixed (marked in \nFig. 11), whereas the other sides were set to free.\n4  Results of Simulation\nExemplary results of simulation tests of rock cutting by \nasymmetric disc tool are shown in Figs.  12, 13, 14 and15. \nThe calculations were conducted on an HP Z840 worksta-\ntion (2 × Intel Xeon 2650). In the case of concrete tests for \nt = 15 mm, the calculation time was about 3–4 h. For sand-\nstone and t = 20 mm, the calculation time was about 65–70 h. \nThe following figures illustrate material failure induced by \nthe pushing disc cutter into a rock sample. It is illustrated \nwith the damage parameter defined as the ratio of the num-\nber of broken bonds to the initial number of cohesive bonds \nFig. 5  LS-Dyna model for the \nsimulation of UCS (left) and \nBTS (right) test\n\n6271Modelling of Rock Cutting with Asymmetrical Disc Tool Using Discrete-Element Method (DEM)  \n1 3\nfor each particle. The value of the damage parameter ranges \nfrom 0 to 1. It is equal to 0 for the undamaged material \nand 1 for the completely damaged one. Observations of the \nprocess of rock destruction in simulation tests, especially \nthe shape of the destruction zone, allow identifying many \nsimilarities to laboratory test results. All the tests were com-\npleted by chip separation, whose dimensions (height, depth) \nwere multiple times higher of the assumed cut spacing. The \nvolume of rock fragments after the mining process with a \ndisc tool was dependent on the value of cut spacing and \nmechanical properties of samples. A higher volume of rock \nfragments was observed for sandstone samples. Depending \non the configuration of the geometric parameters tested and \nthe properties of the sample, the disc penetration causing the \nsample to be destroyed ranged from 5 to 10 mm. This param-\neter was consistent with the results of analogous laboratory \ntests (Stopka 2020).\nDuring simulation tests normal (press) force  (Fz) and lat-\neral force  (Fx) acting on a disc tool were monitored. These \nparameters were the most critical factors that were used to \nFig. 6  Calibration scheme of \nDEM model\n\n6272 G. Stopka \n1 3\nverify the adequacy of the model. Figure 16 shows selected \nforce waveforms for various configurations of process \nparameters and physical properties of rock samples for disc \ntools 150 and 160 mm (t = 15 mm). The recorded waveforms \nare characterised by the variability typical for the processes \nof rock centre destruction by a tool similar in profile to the \nwedge. Based on the simulation results (for both rock sam-\nples), it can be concluded that increasing the cut spacing \nfrom 15 to 25 mm causes an almost twofold increase in \nthe pressing force. Increasing the disc diameter from 150 \nto 160 mm resulted in an increase in the pressing force by \nabout 15%. The lateral force is approximately 35% of the \nnormal force. Finally, the results of the simulation tests were \nused to identify the maximum destructive forces. In the next \nstage, these data were used to validate the numerical model.\n4.1  Validation of Numerical Model\nThe purpose of experimental validation tests was to assess \nthe accuracy of calculations using a numerical model. Labo-\nratory research has been conducted in an analogy way to the \nFig. 7  Results of experimental and simulation UCS tests for concrete\nFig. 8  Results of experimental and simulation BTS tests for concrete\nTable 2  The macro- and micro-properties of the DEM rock samples \nafter calibration process\nParameter Concrete Sandstone\nUniaxial compressive strength (UCS), MPa 22.9 73\nBrazilian tensile strength (BTS), MPa\nYoung’s modulus, GPa\nPoisson’s ratio\n2.7\n1.69\n0.28\n6.4\n9.32\n0.18\nRadius of particles  (RDES), mm 1–2 1\nRatio shear to normal stiffness (PBS) 0.4 0.4\nParallel-bond normal stiffness (PBN), GPa 1.3 9\nBond normal stress limit (PBN_S), MPa\nBond shear stress limit (PBS_S), MPa\nNormal spring constant (Kn ), KN/mm\nTangential spring constant ( K s ), KN/mm\nMAXGAP, mm\nSFA\nNumerical damping coefficient (ALPHA), 0–1\nDamping constant  (Dn), KN·ms/mm\n14\n14\n0.16\n0.05\n− 1\n1.2\n0.05\n0.0023\n46\n46\n0.52\n0.15\n− 0.6\n1.2\n0.05\n0.0023\nFig. 9  Geometrical parameters of the rock–tool model (unit: mm)\n6273Modelling of Rock Cutting with Asymmetrical Disc Tool Using Discrete-Element Method (DEM)  \n1 3\nnumerical one. Therefore, in laboratory tests, a disc tool with \na diameter of 150 and 160 mm was tested, as well as rock \nsamples with mechanical properties presented in Table  1. \nExperimental tests were carried out on a dedicated labora-\ntory stand (Fig.  16). Each operation on the stand is carried \nout using hydraulic cylinders. The presented stand allows \nattaching the disc tool to the holder. The construction of this \nholder permits to change the position of the disc relative to \nthe sample, and thus gives the opportunity to set the right cut \nspacing. The system is equipped with a strain gauge force \nsensor that allows measuring the pressure force in the range \nof 0–200 kN and a transformer displacement sensor with \na measuring range of 0–300 mm. The disc tool is pressed \nthrough the feed system of the station into a rock sample \nwith a constant velocity. During the conducted research, the \nnormal force  (Fz) and displacement of the disc tool were \nmeasured and recorded. Figure  17 shows exemplary forms \nof destruction of sandstone samples mined with disc tools \n150 mm in diameter. On the right side of the figure, the form \nof a sample crack is presented after the analogous test has \nbeen performed on the simulation model. In contrast, Fig. 18 \npresents a form of spoil being the result of mining disc with \ndiameters Ø 160 and the cut spacing t = 15 mm. The analysis \nof the dimensions and form of rock fragments after mining \ntests showed that the numerical model predictions were rea-\nsonably accurate. Examples of normal force waveforms from \nexperimental tests and simulations are shown in Figs.  19, \n20, 21 and 22.\nQuantitative results of laboratory and simulation tests are \nshown in Figs. 23, 24, 25 and 26. The graphs show the maxi-\nmum (destructive) values of normal force. The blue colour \nin the graphs indicates the maximum normal force as an \naverage of 5 experimental tests. The bars showing the simu-\nlation results are marked in red. The results of experimental \nand simulation tests for concrete samples are presented in \nFigs. 18 and 19. The results of tests for sandstone samples \nare shown in Figs. 20 and 21.\nThe agreement between simulation and measurement \ntests was assessed with relative errors (Table  4). The pre -\nsented comparison shows that the model developed in LS-\nDyna shows good accordance with the experimental studies. \nThe discrepancy between the results of simulation tests is \nslightly larger for concrete samples. This is mainly due to the \ngreater dispersion of the mechanical properties of concrete. \nThe correlation between simulation and experimental tests \nfor sandstone samples is very good. The maximum differ -\nence does not exceed 10% at all.\n4.2  Practical Use of Research Results\nThe results presented in this paper show a great potential of \nDEM modelling in the aspect of load analysis of asymmetric \ndisc tools. The rock-chipping process using asymmetric disc \ntools can be modelled with satisfactory accuracy at relatively \nhigh DEM particle radiuses. The test results confirm the \npossibility of scaling the models and increasing their com-\nplexity. Regardless of the above, the test results presented in \nFig. 10  Discretization of the rock–tool model in LS-Dyna\nTable 3  Characterisation of the particle assembly for simulation tests \nwith disc tools\nParameter Concrete Sandstone\nRadius of particles  (RDES), mm 1–2 1\nNumber of particles\nCoordination number  (nc)\n17,615\n8.94\n57,316\n10.01\nFig. 11  Boundary conditions \napplied on the rock’s model\n\n6274 G. Stopka \n1 3\nthe paper can be used for approximate identification of work \nsystem loads in rock excavation performed by real machines. \nAn example of this is the disc head design, which was con-\nstructed at the AGH University of Science and Technology \nin Cracow. The disc tools of this head move along a complex \ntrajectory. However, the method of rock destruction is simi-\nlar to the model of pressing a disc into a rock sample pre-\nsented in this paper. This is due to the kinematics of working \nhead system. Therefore, the approach presented in the paper \nwas used to calculate the structural nodes of the disc head. A \nnumber of laboratory and field tests showed the correctness \nof adopted design assumptions. Figure  27 presents the disc \ntest on a dedicated test stand. Whilst Fig.  28 shows a view \nof the disc head during the field tests.\nFig. 12  Simulation of con-\ncrete cutting (D = 150 mm, \nt = 15 mm)–material damage\nFig. 13  Simulation of concrete cutting (D = 150  mm, t = 25  mm)–\nmaterial damage\nFig. 14  Simulation of sand-\nstone cutting (D = 150 mm, \nt = 15 mm)–material damage\n\n6275Modelling of Rock Cutting with Asymmetrical Disc Tool Using Discrete-Element Method (DEM)  \n1 3\nFig. 15  Simulation of sand-\nstone cutting (D = 160 mm, \nt = 15 mm)–material damage\nFig. 16  Normal and lateral force \nhistories for concrete (left) and \nfor sandstone (right)\nFig. 17  The cracks in the front \nsurface of the rock sample after \nmining tests (left) and the chip \nformation in numerical simula-\ntion (right)\n\n6276 G. Stopka \n1 3\n5  Conclusion\nOne of the fundamental problems of the application of asym-\nmetrical disc tools in mining machine heads is the issues of \nidentification of their loads. Currently, there are no model \nfoundations that would allow evaluating a load of disc tools, \nespecially in the conditions of complex mining kinematics. \nThe development of computer simulation tools gives hope \nfor the development of efficient mining models due to the \nrequired accuracy and acceptable time-consumption of each \ntest. The use of advanced numerical models DEM will ena-\nble the expansion of research possibilities in this field.\nThe results of the model tests presented in the article \nshow great possibilities in the field of rock destruction mod-\nelling, especially in the aspect of cutting rock with asymmet-\nrical disc tools. Taking into account the above the simulation \nresults, it should be emphasised that tested models are prom-\nising in terms of a balance between the speed of calculations \nand the accuracy of the simulation. An important result of \nthe research was the identification of the particle size of the \nFig. 18  Destruction zone \ndimensions (chip dimensions) \nafter experimental (left) and \nsimulation tests (right)—sand-\nstone, D = 160, t = 15 mm\nFig. 19  Normal force–displacement curve for concrete (D = 150 mm, \nt = 15 mm)\nFig. 20  Normal force–displacement curve for concrete (D = 160 mm, \nt = 15 mm)\n6277Modelling of Rock Cutting with Asymmetrical Disc Tool Using Discrete-Element Method (DEM)  \n1 3\nnumerical model (RDES) for which a good correlation with \nthe experimental results was obtained. From a practical point \nof view, the presented test results can be input data for devel-\noping simulation models on a larger scale. Thus, it will be \npossible to take into account the complex kinematics of the \ndynamics of the rock-mining process with disc tools using \nthe DEM simulation. Consequently, numerical modelling \nwill be used instead of more expensive and time-consuming \nexperimental works.\nFig. 21  Normal force–displacement curve for sandstone \n(D = 150 mm, t = 15 mm)\nFig. 22  Normal force–displacement curve for sandstone \n(D = 160 mm, t = 15 mm)\nFig. 23  Comparison of maximum normal force obtained in experi-\nment and numerical simulation: concrete, D = 150 mm\nFig. 24  Comparison of maximum normal force obtained in experi-\nment and numerical simulation: concrete, D = 160 mm\nFig. 25  Comparison of maximum normal force obtained in experi-\nment and numerical simulation: sandstone, D = 150 mm\n6278 G. Stopka \n1 3\nOpen Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attri-\nbution 4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing, adapta-\ntion, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long \nas you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, \nprovide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if changes \nwere made.
