INTRODUCTION \n \nBasic diagnostics for a non -destructive \nmeasurement of electrical devices using \nthermovision, is the opportunity to record infrared \nradiation to the form of real thermal pictures of \nmeasured objects, and on the basis  of overheating \nof certain surround, for a detec tion of a fault \n(defect). \nWith non-contact measurement it is possible to \nverify the temperature distribution on the surface of \nmeasured objects using sensitivity measuring of a \nfew Kelvin (or ˚C) decimal [1].  \nInfrared radiation is generated as a result of \nvarious physical processes that take place in the \nobject of radiation; vibration in crystal lattice, \nmoving atoms, molecules and transition of \nelectrons from one energy level to anot her. The \nbasic source of infrared radiation is elevated \ntemperature of the radiation source.   \nRadiation of thermal sources acts like (in \nrespect of ambient conditions), like visual light. For \nthermovision is important to identify materials used \nfor elemen ts of visualization systems, that size of \nvalues which are derived from the wavelength of \nmaterial radiation, and also sensitivity of sensors \nfor recording the signal.   \nPrecision of thermal measurement for \nthermovision diagnostics is impacted by following  \nfactors: \n incorrect determination of emissivity - radiation \ncoefficient of measured object ε (λ, T), \n low current load  of  measured electric \nequipment, because current load has a relevant \nrole for assessment of measuring warming, \n influence of other hot obj ects close to measured \nobjects and  inaccurate  determination of  \nsurrounding temperature can cause both changes \nof emission coefficient, \n incorrectly interpretation of measured values of \nwarming, \n various surfaces (the surface may be chromatic, \noxidized surfaces and peeled paint on materials) \nmay cause wrong evaluation of results. \nFor diagnostics of infrared radiation by \nthermovision the inside transfer and distribution of \nelectric power, it is need to take into account many \nrelevant factors affecting the measurement accuracy \n[2]. \nFundamental for a non -destructive diagnostics \nof electrical devices using thermovision systems, is \nthe ability to record and to work infrared radiation \n(thermal radiation) to the form of real thermal \nimages Fig. 1, of measured objects, and on the basis \nof overheating of certain parts diagnosed objects, to \ndetect a fault (defect). \nThe research analysis show that the method \nbased on recognition of thermal images may be \nprofitable for technical engineers [3]. \n \n \nFig. 1.

THE THEORY OF INFRARED \nRADIATION \n \nThe surface of the measured object in a state of \nthermodynamic equilibrium emits electromagnetic \nradiation and the radiated power depends on the \nthermodynamic temperatur e and properties of the \nobject surface. Radiation power (intensity) H (λ,T) \nis the only parameter that is measured by infrared \nreceiver and is a function for emission coefficient \nε(λ,T) and temperature T of radiation source [4].  \n \n  4TT,H    (1) \nThis uncertainty (the value of one parameter is \nsubject of another parameter) is one of the problems \nof measuring the infrared radiation. Emission \ncoefficient too depends on the direction from which \nis the radiation recorded, on the temperature and \nalso on the surface of material.  \nHeating is defined by the relationship α/ε, where \nα is the absorption coefficient of energy and ε is the \nemission coefficient (emissivity) of the measured \nbody [5]. \nIn Fig. 2 is dependence of spectral density – \nintensity of radiation to wavelength. \nRatio of intensity radiation of actual body and \nideal black body at the same temperature is defined \nby spectral emissivity coefficient: [6] \n \n \n T,H\nT,H)T,( \n\n\n\n\n0\n  (2) \nIn Fig. 2 is dependence of spectral density – \nintensity of radiation to wavelength. \n \nFig. 2. Dependence of spectral density - intensity of \nradiation to wavelength \nCoefficient of spectral emissivity is equal to the \nspectral absorption coeff icient. The research on \nissues of radiation of solid bo dies is based on \nknowledge of absolute black body; an object which \nis able to fully absorb the full sp ectrum of radiated \nenergy. By Kirchhoff’s law the black body is an \nideal emitter.

THERMOVISION ADDITION IN \nDIAGNOSTICS OF POWER \nTRANSFORMERS \n \nThe temperature measurement by means of \ncontact (invasive) a method is in many cases very \ndifficult and from working and sa fety reasons \nnearly impossible. For this reason it is necessary to \naim at such measuring equipment  and methods of \ntemperature measurements which do not require the \ndirect contact with measured equipment. \nDiagnostics of equipment  satisfying these \nconditions are based on the radiated infrared energy \nscanning. Infrared techniques thus finds its \napplication anywhere such physical quantity, like \ntemperature, gives us information about the \ntechnical state of the equipment in question or \nabout some its part. \nInfrared thermograph is a contactless (non -\ninvasive) way of temperature distribution \nmeasurement on the scanned object surface in the \ninfrared area (1μm - 13μm) of the electromagnetic \nspectrum.  \nInfrared measurements can be realized quickly \nand economically with the minimum time and work \nas they do not require any adaptations or turning -\nout of measured equipment. Thermovision \ntechniques are used at the transformers control in \norder to find out whether the te mperature of its \nsome parts does not raise ( Fig. 5). Al so the \ntransformer’s bushings , thermal field distribution \non oil transformer tanks are tested, etc. \n \n4. THERMAL PROCESSES IN \nDISTRIBUTION OIL TRANSFORMER \n \nElectric energy lost in transformer in conversion \nof alternating current is converted into heat in \nwinding, magnetic circuit and in other parts of the \ntransformer. At the same time transformer heat´s up \nand the temperature of its individual parts can \ngreatly exceed the ambient temperature. With \nincreasing load and with emerging losses the \ntemperature of t he transf ormer rises, this all \ndepends on  cooling winding, magnetic circuit and \nother heated parts. \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 5. Real transformer temperature picture \nAs far as temperature, transformer is \ninhomogeneous element. Sheets of magnetic circuit \nare characterized by high thermal conductivity and \nrelatively low thermal capacity. They are taking  \nturns with layers of insulation (lacquer etc.), whose \nthermal conductivity is not large. Similarly, the \nwinding of the transformer is a complex \nconfiguration of copper or a luminum, which has \nhigh thermal conductivity with insulating material. \nIt consists of electrical insulation as well as thermal \ninsulation.  \nDIAGNOSTYKA, Vol. 20, No. 2 (2019)  \nSebok M, Kucera M, Korenciak D, Gutten M.: Thermal diagnostic systems and their application for … \n \n52 \nIn oil transformers , magnetic circuit and \nwindings are sprayed by transformer oil , where the \nlevel is considerably h igher than the highest part of \nthe magnetic circuit . Oil particles (Fig . 6), \ntangential to the warm surface of the winding and \nthe magnetic circuit are  heated, soar upwards and \ntransmitted it´s heat through the walls and the lid of \nthe container into the s urrounding area. Cooled oil \nparticles fall down and release their place for other \nwarmer particles. In this case the share of heat \nhappens by convection. Between winding and \nmagnetic circuit on one side and oil on the other \nside a temperature difference is  stabilized. \nHowever, the oil temperature and other parts of the \ntransformer tank at different heights are different. \nFig. 8 shows a typical waveform of temperature \nchanges due to height of the transformer.  \nHeat passes through the transformer tank wall.  \nTransfer of heat from the surface of the tank is \ncaused by convection, i.e. by the movement of the \nhot moving particles as well as by radiation of heat. \nThe temperature difference between the tank and \nthe ambient air can reach several dozen of degrees. \nTypical distribution of temperatures in horizontal \ncut of oil transformer is shown in Fig. 6. [10]    \n \n1 – oil temperature, 2 – wall of tank temperature, 3 – \nwinding temperature, 4 – core temperature \nFig. 6. Typical temperature course in dependence on \nheight of oil transformer \n \n5. DESCRIPTION OF EXPERIMENTAL \nMEASUREMENT \n \nAs an example of analysis of thermal processes \nin transformer by using the thermovision and \nmethod of monitoring r efrigerating curves by \noptical detectors it was  used experimental \nmeasurement with distribution oil transformer 30 \nkVA, 22/0.4 kV with cooling natural system (Fig.  \n8), which is located in the Laboratory of electrical \nmachine diagnostics of the University of Zilina. \n \n    \nFig.7. Typical temperature distribution in sectional plan \nof oil transformer \n \nFig. 8. View of the measured transformer and system \nNEOPTIX T \nFor contact thermal measurement of transformer \nwinding was used two optical detectors by fibers. \nThey were led out by special duct to the top part of \nthe transformer tank and mounted on the middl e \nwinding at its top and middle part and from there \nthey were led by two optical fibers to the measuring \nsystem NEOPTIX T (Fig.  8), which was analyzed \nmeasured temperature of transformer winding. \nTransformer contacts, bushings and tank i s \nmonitored by thermovision camera FLUKE. In Fig. \n9-down is vertical decrease of temperature for \nmonitoring transformer winding in top (W1) and \nmiddle (W2) part of the coil . According to [11], \n[12] thermal strain is the greatest in the top area of \nthe tran sformer. Thermal influence of core on \nsurrounding areas of transformer (winding, oil, and \ntank) is simulated in Fig. 10. \nDIAGNOSTYKA, Vol. 20, No. 2 (2019)  \nSebok M, Kucera M, Korenciak D, Gutten M.: Thermal diagnostic systems and their application for … \n \n53 \nIt is necessary to suggest, that according to Fig.  \n6 it attained temperature difference between tank \nand winding top of oil transformer about 50 %. \n \n     \n \nFig. 9. Decomposition temperature of monitored \ntransformer 22/0.4 kV – 30% load \nAfter several months lasting operation of the \ntransformer at approximately 30% load the analysis \nof measured temperature values in dependence on \ntime at i ts sudden cut off was performed on \nmeasured winding phase. \nIt is necessary to mention that in oil tank the top \nand the middle part of the winding reacts differently \non sudden changes. Thereby we observed possible \nbehavior differences at two winding parts d uring \nrefrigeration process after cutting the device off. \nLevels of refrigeration decrease may include level \nof winding mechanical strength, insulation quality \nand viscosity of oil in the transformer tank.    \nFig. 11 shows the comparison of measured \nwindings temperature values in dependency on the \ntime after cutting the device off. The temperature \ndecrease to 48 °C in the top part of the windings \n(W1) took 75 seconds and in the middle part (W2) \nonly 50 seconds. That corresponds to the expected \noil’s tempera ture distr ibution after cutting the \ntransformer off.  \n \n \nFig. 10. Thermal influence of core on surrounding areas \nof distribution transformer \nThe temperature of oil in the transformer tank \nincreases from certain minimum value at the \nbottom of the tank to th e maximum value - \napproximately to the height of the windings top \nedge. This maximum temperature is more or less \nmaintained in the whole mass of oil under the top \ntransformer cover. \n \n \nFig. 11. Measured windings temperature values in \ndependency on the time \n6. DISCUSSION TO THE MEASURED DATA \n \nIt was detected some conclusions on the base \ncomparing the measured refrigerating curves on the \ntop part (W1) and on the middle part (W2) of the \nsame winding phase by optical detectors and \nthermovision of transformer tank.  \nMeasured parts of windings show different \ndependency of refrigerating curves. It is mainly \ncaused by the level of distribution of the oil \ntemperature rise and the winding surface with \nrespect to the ambient along the height of measured \ntransformer. Ac cording Fig.  9 it is temperature \ndifference about 2 °C between optical sensors W1 \nand W2, which was measured on surface of tank by \nthermovision camera. \nWhen decreasing the selected measured \ntemperature  = 48 °C , which represents \nDIAGNOSTYKA, Vol. 20, No. 2 (2019)  \nSebok M, Kucera M, Korenciak D, Gutten M.: Thermal diagnostic systems and their application for … \n \n54 \napproximately 60% of the a mount of exp onential \nrefrigerating curve, it was  determined the cooling \ntime for the W1 t1 = 75 s and for the W2 t2 = 50 s \nfrom the graph in Fig. 11. \nBy comparing these detected values using the \nequations (10) and others by [13] it was identified \nout on th e top part of the windings (W1) until 1.5 \ntimes higher  possible stress of the m echanical \nstrength caused by temperature shocks (short -\ncircuit currents) than on the middle part of the \nwindings (W2). That is also proved in the following \nequation: \n \n5.150\n75\n2\n1\n2\n1  t\nt\nA\nAa  (10) \nwhere [14] \na – multiple of short-circuit strength, \nA1, A2 – damping coefficients at cooling process, \nt1, t2 – cooling time. \n \nIt is obvious that the top part of the windings \nwill be the most heavily stressed by the effects of \ntemperature de gradation by operation or short-\ncircuit currents. \n \n7. CONCLUSION \n \nA very important problem, whether in electrical \nengineering or other industries, is the identification \nof a failure, when it is still unnecessary to dismantle \nthe equipment (diagnostics without dismantling). In \nthis paper, we wanted to show out the possibility of \nusing thermal measurements in this field of analysis \nand detection of quality of winding for distribution \noil transformer.  \nThese methods possible to localize places of  \nfaults and it can also serve for the diagnosis and \ndetection of disorders in material quality and other \nanomalies during operation of the equipment  [15],  \n[16].         \nBy the experimental measurements and \nfollowing diagnostic analysis it was showed the \npractical use of thermovision and optical sensors \nfor diagnostics of power oil transformers in field \nmechanical strength and quality of winding. It is \nobvious that the total mechanical degradation of \ncoil material is given by several factors – the grade \nof the winding mechanical strength, the insulation \nquality of coil, but also the oil conductivity and \nviscosity in the transformer tank. \nIn conclusion it showed important facts , t hat \ntransformers with much number of shorts it is \nnecessary to analyze for whole  interval time of the \nshort-circuit currents, to prevent unpredictable fa ult \nduring operation. It is necessary to choose the \nsuitable diagnostics, which could anticipate such a \ncondition. \n \n \n \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n \nThis work was supported by the Grant Agency \nVEGA from the Ministry of Education of Slovak \nRepublic under contract 1/0602/17. \n \nREFERENCES \n \n1.
