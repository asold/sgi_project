Introduction\nThe architectures based on the self-attention mechanism\nhave achieved great success in the ﬁeld of Natural Lan-\nguage Processing (NLP) [34]. There have been attempts\nto utilize the self-attention mechanism in computer vision.\nNon-local networks [37] and DETR [4] are representative\nworks, showing that the self-attention mechanism is also ef-\nfective in video classiﬁcation and object detection tasks, re-\nspectively. Recently, Vision Transformer (ViT) [9], a trans-\nformer architecture consisting of self-attention layers, has\nbeen proposed to compete with ResNet [13], and shows that\nit can achieve the best performance without convolution op-\n*Work done as a research scientist at NA VER AI Lab.\neration on ImageNet [8]. As a result, a new direction of net-\nwork architectures based on self-attention mechanism, not\nconvolution operation, has emerged in computer vision.\nViT is quite different from convolutional neural networks\n(CNN). Input images are divided into 16 ×16 patches and\nfed to the transformer network; except for the ﬁrst embed-\nding layer, there is no convolution operation in ViT, and the\nposition interactions occur only through the self-attention\nlayers. While CNNs have restricted spatial interactions, ViT\nallows all the positions in an image to interact through trans-\nformer layers. Although ViT is an innovative architecture\nand has proven its powerful image recognition ability, it fol-\nlows the transformer architecture in NLP [34] without any\nchanges. Some essential design principles of CNNs, which\nhave proved to be effective in the computer vision domain\nover the past decade, are not sufﬁciently reﬂected. We thus\nrevisit the design principles of CNN architectures and in-\nvestigate their efﬁcacy when applied to ViT architectures.\nCNNs start with a feature of large spatial sizes and a\nsmall channel size and gradually increase the channel size\nwhile decreasing the spatial size. This dimension conver-\nsion is indispensable due to the layer called spatial pool-\ning. Modern CNN architectures, including AlexNet [21],\nResNet [13], and EfﬁcientNet [32], follow this design prin-\nciple. The pooling layer is deeply related to the receptive\nﬁeld size of each layer. Some studies [6, 26, 5] show that\nthe pooling layer contributes to the expressiveness and gen-\neralization performance of the network. However, unlike the\nCNNs, ViT does not use a pooling layer and uses the same\nspatial dimension for all layers.\nFirst, we verify the advantages of dimensions conﬁgu-\nrations on CNNs. Our experiments show that ResNet-style\ndimensions improve the model capability and generaliza-\ntion performance of ResNet. To extend the advantages to\nViT, we propose a Pooling-based Vision Transformer (PiT).\nPiT is a transformer architecture combined with a newly de-\nsigned pooling layer. It enables the spatial size reduction in\nthe ViT structure as in ResNet. We also investigate the ben-\neﬁts of PiT compared to ViT and conﬁrm that ResNet-style\ndimension setting also improves the performance of ViT.\nFinally, to analyze the effect of PiT compared to ViT, we\narXiv:2103.16302v2  [cs.CV]  18 Aug 2021\n(a) ResNet-50\n56×56×256\n224×224×3\n28×28×51214×14×10247×7×2048\n(b) ViT-S/16\n(14×14)×384Spatial tokens\n1×384Class token224×224×3\n(14×14)×288Spatial tokens\n1×144 Class token\n224×224×3\n(27×27)×144 (7×7)×576\n1×288 1×576PoolingPooling(c) PiT-S\nFigure 1.

The analysis shows the\nattention patterns inside layers of ViT and PiT, and helps to\nunderstand the inner mechanism of ViT and PiT.\nWe verify that PiT improves performances over ViT on\nvarious tasks. On ImageNet classiﬁcation, PiT and outper-\nforms ViT at various scales and training environments. Ad-\nditionally, we have compared the performance of PiT with\nvarious convolutional architectures and have speciﬁed the\nscale at which the transformer architecture outperforms the\nCNN. We further measure the performance of PiT as a back-\nbone for object detection. ViT- and PiT-based deformable\nDETR [44] are trained on the COCO 2017 dataset [24] and\nthe result shows that PiT is even better than ViT as a back-\nbone architecture for a task other than image classiﬁcation.\nFinally, we verify the performance of PiT in various envi-\nronments through the robustness benchmark.\n2. Related works\n2.1. Dimension conﬁguration of CNN\nDimension conversion can be found in AlexNet [21],\nwhich is one of the earliest convolutional networks in com-\nputer vision. AlexNet uses three max-pooling layers. In the\nmax-pooling layer, the spatial size of the feature is reduced\nby half, and the channel size is increased by the convolu-\ntion after the max-pooling. VGGnet [30] uses 5 spatial res-\nolutions using 5 max-pooling. In the pooling layer, the spa-\ntial size is reduced by half and the channel size is doubled.\nGoogLeNet [31] also used the pooling layer. ResNet [13]\nperformed spatial size reduction using the convolution layer\nof stride 2 instead of max pooling. It is an improvement\nin the spatial reduction method. The convolution layer of\nstride 2 is also used as a pooling method in recent archi-\ntectures (EfﬁcietNet [32], MobileNet [29, 19]). Pyramid-\nNet [11] pointed out that the channel increase occurs only\nin the pooling layer and proposed a method to gradually\nincrease the channel size in layers other than the pooling\nlayer. ReXNet [12] reported that the channel conﬁguration\nof the network has a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the network\nperformance. In summary, most convolution networks use a\ndimension conﬁguration with spatial reduction.\n2.2. Self-attention mechanism\nTransformer architecture [34] signiﬁcantly increased the\nperformance of the NLP task with the self-attention mecha-\nnism. Funnel Transformer [7] improves the transformer ar-\nchitecture by reducing tokens by a pooling layer and skip-\nconnection. However, because of the basic difference be-\ntween the architecture of NLP and computer vision, the\nmethod of applying to pool is different from our method.\nSome studies are conducted to utilize the transformer archi-\ntecture to the backbone network for computer vision tasks.\nNon-local network [37] adds a few self-attention layers to\nCNN backbone, and it shows that the self-attention mecha-\nnism can be used in CNN. [28] replaced 3 ×3 convolution\nof ResNet to local self-attention layer. [36] used an atten-\ntion layer for each spatial axis. [2] enables self-attention of\nthe entire spatial map by reducing the computation of the\nattention mechanism. Most of these methods replace 3x3\nconvolution with self-attention or adds a few self-attention\nlayers. Therefore, the basic structure of ResNet is inherited,\nthat is, it has the convolution of stride 2 as ResNet, resulting\nin a network having a dimension conﬁguration of ResNet.\nOnly the vision transformer uses a structure that uses\nthe same spatial size in all layers. Although ViT did not\nfollow the conventions of ResNet, it contains many valu-\nable new components in the network architecture. In ViT,\nlayer normalization is applied for each spatial token. There-\nfore, layer normalization of ViT is closer to positional nor-\nmalization [22] than a layer norm of convolutional neural\nnetwork [1, 39]. Although it overlaps with the lambda net-\nwork [2], it is not common to use global attention through\nall blocks of the network. The use of class tokens instead\nof global average pooling is also new, and it has been re-\nported that separating tokens increases the efﬁciency of dis-\ntillation [33]. In addition, the layer conﬁguration, the skip-\nconnection position, and the normalization position of the\nTransformer are also different from ResNet. Therefore, our\nstudy gives a direction to the new architecture.\n(a) Model capability\n (b) Generalization performance\n (c) Model performance\nFigure 2. Effects of the spatial dimensions in ResNet50 [13]. We verify the effect of the spatial dimension with ResNet50. As shown in\nthe ﬁgures, ResNet-style is better than ViT-style in the model capability, generalization performance, and model performance.\n3. Revisiting spatial dimensions\nIn order to introduce dimension conversion to ViT,\nwe investigate spatial dimensions in network architectures.\nFirst, we verify the beneﬁts of dimension conﬁguration in\nResNet architecture. Although dimension conversion has\nbeen widely used for most convolutional architectures, its\neffectiveness is rarely veriﬁed. Based on the ﬁndings, we\npropose a Pooling-based Vision Transformer (PiT) that ap-\nplies the ResNet-style dimension to ViT. We propose a new\npooling layer for transformer architecture and design ViT\nwith the new pooling layer (PiT). With PiT models, we ver-\nify whether the ResNet-style dimension brings advantages\nto ViT. In addition, we analyze the attention matrix of the\nself-attention block of ViT to investigate the effect of PiT in\nthe transformer mechanism. Finally, we introduce PiT ar-\nchitectures corresponding to various scales of ViT.\n3.1. Dimension setting of CNN\nAs shown in Figure 1 (a), most convolutional architec-\ntures reduce the spatial dimension while increases the chan-\nnel dimension. In ResNet50, a stem layer reduces the spatial\nsize of an image to56×56. After several layer blocks, Con-\nvolution layers with stride 2 reduce the spatial dimension by\nhalf and double the channel dimension. The spatial reduc-\ntion using a convolution layer with stride 2 is a frequently\nused method in recent architectures [32, 29, 19, 12]. We\nconduct an experiment to analyze the performance differ-\nence according to the presence or absence of the spatial re-\nduction layer in a convolutional architecture. ResNet50, one\nof the most widely used networks in ImageNet, is used for\narchitecture and is trained over 100 epochs without complex\ntraining techniques. For ResNet with ViT style dimension,\nwe use the stem layer of ViT to reduce the feature to14×14\nspatial dimensions while reducing the spatial information\nloss in the stem layer. We also remove the spatial reduction\nlayers of ResNet to maintain the initial feature dimensions\nfor all layers like ViT. We measured the performance for\nseveral sizes by changing the channel size of ResNet.\nFirst, we measured the relation between FLOPs and\ntraining loss of ResNet with ResNet-style or ViT-style di-\nmension conﬁguration. As shown in Figure 2 (a), ResNet\n(ResNet-style) shows lower training loss over the same\ncomputation costs (FLOPs). It implies that ResNet-style di-\nmensions increase the capability of architecture. Next, we\nanalyzed the relation between training and validation ac-\ncuracy, which represents the generalization performance of\narchitecture. As shown in Figure 2 (b), ResNet (ResNet-\nstyle) achieves higher validation accuracy than ResNet\n(ViT-style). Therefore, ResNet-style dimension conﬁgura-\ntion is also helpful for generalization performance. In sum-\nmary, ResNet-style dimension improves the model capabil-\nity and generalization performance of the architecture and\nconsequently brings a signiﬁcant improvement in validation\naccuracy as shown in Figure 2 (c).\n3.2. Pooling-based Vision Transformer (PiT)\nVision Transformer (ViT) performs network operations\nbased on self-attention, not convolution operations. In the\nself-attention mechanism, the similarity between all loca-\ntions is used for spatial interaction. Figure 1 (b) shows the\ndimension structure of this ViT. Similar to the stem layer\nof CNN, ViT divides the image by patch at the ﬁrst embed-\nding layer and embedding it to tokens. Basically, the struc-\nture does not include a spatial reduction layer and keeps\nthe same number of spatial tokens overall layer of the net-\nwork. Although the self-attention operation is not limited\nby spatial distance, the size of the spatial area participat-\ning in attention is affected by the spatial size of the feature.\nTherefore, in order to adjust the dimension conﬁguration\nlike ResNet, a spatial reduction layer is also required in ViT.\nTo utilize the advantages of the dimension conﬁgura-\ntion to ViT, we propose a new architecture called Pooling-\nbased Vision Transformer (PiT). First, we designed a pool-\ning layer for ViT. Our pooling layer is shown in Figure 4.\nSince ViT handles neuron responses in the form of 2D-\nmatrix rather than 3D-tensor, the pooling layer should sep-\n(a) Model capability\n (b) Generalization performance\n (c) Model performance\nFigure 3. Effects of the spatial dimensions in vision transformer (ViT) [9]. We compare our Pooling-based Vision Transformer (PiT)\nwith original ViT at various aspects.

After reshaping, spatial size reduction and\nchannel increase are performed by depth-wise convolution.\nAnd, the responses are reshaped into a 2D matrix for the\ncomputation of transformer blocks. In ViT, there are parts\nthat do not correspond to the spatial structure, such as a\nclass token or distillation token [33]. For these parts, the\npooling layer uses an additional fully-connected layer to ad-\njust the channel size to match the spatial tokens. Our pool-\ning layer enables spatial reduction on ViT and is used for\nour PiT architecture as shown in Figure 1 (c). PiT includes\ntwo pooling layers which make three spatial scales.\nUsing PiT architecture, we performed an experiment to\nverify the effect of PiT compared to ViT. The experiment\nsetting is the same as the ResNet experiment. Figure 3 (a)\nrepresents the model capability of ViT and PiT. At the same\ncomputation cost, PiT has a lower train loss than ViT. Us-\ning the spatial reduction layers in ViT also improves the ca-\npability of architecture. The comparison between training\naccuracy and validation accuracy shows a signiﬁcant dif-\nference. As shown in Figure 3 (b), ViT does not improve\nvalidation accuracy even if training accuracy increases. On\nthe other hand, in the case of PiT, validation accuracy in-\ncreases as training accuracy increases. The big difference in\ngeneralization performance causes the performance differ-\nence between PiT and ViT as shown in Figure 3 (c). The\nphenomenon that ViT does not increase performance even\nwhen FLOPs increase in ImageNet is reported in ViT pa-\nper [9]. In the training data of ImageNet scale, ViT shows\npoor generalization performance, and PiT alleviates this.\nSo, we believe that the spatial reduction layer is also nec-\nessary for the generalization of ViT. Using the training trick\nis a way to improve the generalization performance of ViT\nin ImageNet. The combination of training tricks and PiT is\ncovered in the experiment section.\n3.3. Attention analysis\nWe analyze the transformer networks with measures on\nattention matrix [35]. We denotes αi,j as (i,j) component\nof attention matrix A ∈RM×N. Note that attention values\nafter soft-max layer is used, i.e. ∑\ni αi,j = 1. The attention\nentropy is deﬁned as\nEntropy = −1\nN\nN∑\nj\n∑\ni\nαi,j log αi,j. (1)\nThe entropy shows the spread and concentration degree of\nan attention interaction. A small entropy indicates a con-\ncentrated interaction, and a large entropy indicates a spread\ninteraction. We also measure an attention distance,\nDistance = 1\nN\nN∑\nj\n∑\ni\nαi,j∥pi −pj∥1. (2)\npi represents relative spatial location of i-th token\n(xi/W,yi/H) for feature map F ∈RH×W×C. So, the at-\ntention distance shows a relative ratio compared to the over-\nall feature size, which enables comparison between the dif-\nferent sizes of features. We analyze transformer-based mod-\nels (ViT-S [33] and PiT-S) and values are measured over-\nall validation images and are averaged over all heads of\neach layer. Our analysis is only conducted for the spatial\ntokens rather than the class token following the previous\nstudy [35]. We also skip the attention of the last transformer\nblock since the spatial tokens of the last attention are inde-\npendent of the network outputs.\nThe results are shown in Figure 5. In ViT, the entropy\nand the distance increase as the layer become deeper. It im-\nplies that the interaction of ViT is concentrated to close to-\nkens at the shallow layers and the interaction is spread in\na wide range of tokens at the deep layers. The entropy and\ndistance pattern of ViT is similar to the pattern of trans-\nformer in the language domain [35]. PiT changes the pat-\nterns with the spatial dimension setting. At shallow layers\n(1-2 layers), large spatial size increases the entropy and dis-\ntance. On the other hand, the entropy and distance are de-\ncreased at deep layers (9-11 layers) due to the small spatial\nsize. In short, the pooling layer of PiT spreads the interac-\ntion in the shallow layers and concentrates the interaction\nin the deep layers. In contrast to discrete word inputs of the\nlanguage domain, the vision domain uses image-patch in-\nputs which require pre-processing operations such as ﬁlter-\ning, contrast, and brightness calibration. In shallow layers,\nthe spread interaction of PiT is close to the pre-processing\nthan the concentrated interaction of ViT. Also, compared to\nlanguage models, image recognition has relatively low out-\nput complexity. So, in deep layers, concentrated interaction\nmight be enough. There are signiﬁcant differences between\nthe vision and the language domain, and we believe that the\nattention of PiT is suitable for image recognition backbone.\n3.4. Architecture design\nThe architectures proposed in ViT paper [9] aimed at\ndatasets larger than ImageNet. These architectures (ViT-\nLarge, ViT-Huge) have an extremely large scale than gen-\neral ImageNet networks, so it is not easy to compare them\nwith other networks. So, following the previous study [33]\nof Vision Transformer on ImageNet, we design the PiT at a\nscale similar to the small-scale ViT architectures (ViT-Base,\nViT-Small, ViT-Tiny). In the DeiT paper [33], ViT-Small\nand ViT-Tiny are named DeiT-S and DeiT-Ti, but to avoid\nconfusion due to the model name change, we use ViT for\nall models. Corresponding to the three scales of ViT (tiny,\nsmall, and base), we design four scales of PiT (tiny, extra\nsmall, small, and base). Detail architectures are described in\nTable 1. For convenience, we abbreviate the model names:\nTiny - Ti, eXtra Small - XS, Small - S, Base - B FLOPs and\nspatial size were measured based on224×224 image. Since\nPiT uses a larger spatial size than ViT, we reduce the stride\nsize of the embedding layer to 8, while patch-size is 16 as\nViT. Two pooling layers are used for PiT, and the channel\nincrease is implemented as increasing the number of heads\nof multi-head attention. We design PiT to have a similar\ndepth to ViT, and adjust the channels and the heads to have\n(a) Attention entropy\n(b) Spatial distance of interaction\nFigure 5. Attention analysis.

ImageNet performance comparison with ViT. We compare the performances of ViT and PiT with some training techniques on\nImageNet dataset. PiT shows better performance with low computation compared to ViT.\n4. Experiments\nWe veriﬁed the performance of PiT through various ex-\nperiments. First, we compared PiT at various scales with\nViT in various training environments of ImageNet training.\nAnd, we extended the ImageNet comparison to architec-\ntures other than Transformer. In particular, we focus on the\ncomparison of the performance of ResNet and PiT, and in-\nvestigate whether PiT can beat ResNet. We also applied PiT\nto an object detector based on deformable DETR [44], and\ncompared the performance as a backbone architecture for\nobject detection. To analyze PiT in various views, we eval-\nuated the performance of PiT on robustness benchmarks.\n4.1. ImageNet classiﬁcation\nWe compared the performance of PiT models of Table 1\nwith corresponding ViT models. To clarify the computa-\ntion time and size of the network, we measured FLOPs, the\nnumber of parameters, and GPU throughput (images/sec)\nof each network. The GPU throughput was measured on\nNVIDIA V100 single GPU with 128 batch-size. We trained\nthe network using four representative training environ-\nments. The ﬁrst is a vanilla setting that trains the network\nwithout complicated training techniques. The vanilla setting\nhas the lowest performance due to the lack of techniques to\nhelp generalization performance and also used for the previ-\nous experiments in Figure 2, 3. The second is training with\nCutMix [41] data augmentation. Although only data aug-\nmentation has changed, it shows signiﬁcantly better perfor-\nmance than the vanilla setting. The third is the DeiT [33]\nsetting, which is a compilation of training techniques to\ntrain ViT on ImageNet-1k [8]. DeiT setting includes vari-\nous training techniques and parameter tuning, and we used\nthe same training setting through the ofﬁcial open-source\ncode. However, in the case of Repeated Augment [18], we\nconﬁrmed that it had a negative effect in a small model, and\nit was used only for Base models. The last is a DeiT set-\nting with knowledge distillation. The distillation setting is\nreported as the best performance setting in DeiT [33] pa-\nper. The network uses an additional distillation token and is\ntrained with distillation loss [17] using RegNetY-16GF [27]\nas a teacher network. We used AdamP [16] optimizer for all\nsettings, and the learning rate, weight decay, and warmup\nwere set equal to DeiT [33] paper. We train models over 100\nepochs for Vanilla and CutMix settings, and 300 epochs for\nDeiT and Distill\n⚗ settings.\nThe results are shown in Table 2. Comparing the PiT\nand ViT of the same name, the PiT has fewer FLOPs and\nfaster speed than ViT. Nevertheless, PiT shows higher per-\nformance than ViT. In the case of vanilla and CutMix set-\ntings, where a few training techniques are applied, the per-\nformance of PiT is superior to the performance of ViT. Even\nin the case of a DeiT and distill settings, PiT shows com-\nparable or better performance to ViT. Therefore, PiT can\nbe seen as a better architecture than ViT in terms of per-\nformance and computation. The generalization performance\nissue of ViT in Figure 3 can also be observed in this experi-\nment. Like ViT-S in the Vanilla setting and ViT-B in the Cut-\nMix setting, ViT often shows no increase in performance\neven when the model size increases. On the other hand, the\nperformance of PiT increases according to the model size in\nall training settings. it seems that the generalization perfor-\nmance problem of ViT is alleviated by the pooling layers.\nWe compared the performance of PiT with the convolu-\ntional networks. In the previous experiment, we performed\nthe comparison in the same training setting using the simi-\nlarity of architecture. However, when comparing various ar-\nchitectures, it is infeasible to unify with a setting that works\nwell for all architectures. Therefore, we performed the com-\nparison based on the best performance reported for each\narchitecture. But, it was limited to the model trained us-\ning only ImageNet images. When the paper that proposed\nthe architecture and the paper that reported the best per-\nformance was different, we cite both papers. When the ar-\nchitecture is different, the comparison of FLOPs often fails\nto reﬂect the actual throughput. Therefore, we re-measured\nthe GPU throughput and number of params on a single\nV100 GPU and compared the top-1 accuracy for the per-\nformance index. Table 3 shows the comparison result.

As shown in the previous\nstudy [33], the performance of ViT is signiﬁcantly improved\non the long training scheme (1000 epochs). So, we vali-\ndate PiT on the long training scheme. As shown in Table 4,\nPiT models show comparable performance with ViT mod-\nels on the long training scheme. Although the performance\nimprovement is reduced than the Distill\n⚗ setting, PiTs still\noutperform ViT counterparts in throughput. Fine-tuning on\nlarge resolution (384 ×384) is a famous method to train a\nlarge ViT model with small computation. In the large res-\nolution setting, PiT has comparable performance with ViT,\nbut, worse than ViT on throughput. It implies that PiT is\ndesigned for 224 ×224 and the design is not compatible\nfor the large resolution. However, we believe that PiT can\noutperform ViT with a new layer design for 384 ×384.\n4.2. Object detection\nWe validate PiT through object detection on COCO\ndataset [24] in Deformable-DETR [44]. We train the detec-\ntors with different backbones including ResNet50, ViT-S,\nand our PiT-S. We follow the training setup of the origi-\nnal paper [44] except for the image resolution. Since the\noriginal image resolution is too large for transformer-based\nbackbones, we halve the image resolution for training and\nStandard Occ IN-A [15] BGC [40] FGSM [10]\nPiT-S 80.8 74.6 21.7 21.0 29.5\nViT-S [33] 79.8 73.0 19.1 17.6 27.2\nResNet50 [13] 76.0 52.2 0.0 22.3 7.1\nResNet50† [38] 79.0 67.1 5.4 32.7 24.7\nTable 6.

We evaluate two\nResNet50 models from the ofﬁcial PyTorch repository, and the\nwell-optimized implementation [38], denoted as †.\ntest of all backbones. We use bounding box reﬁnement and a\ntwo-stage scheme for the best performance [44]. For multi-\nscale features for ViT-S, we use features at the 2nd, 8th, and\n12th layers following the position of pooling layers on PiT.\nAll detectors are trained for 50 epochs and the learning rate\nis dropped by factor 1/10 at 40 epochs.\nTable 5 shows the measured AP score on val2017. The\ndetector based on PiT-S outperforms the detector with ViT-\nS. It shows that the pooling layer of PiT is effective not only\nfor ImageNet classiﬁcation but also for pretrained backbone\nfor object detection. We measured single image latency with\na random noise image at resolution600×400 PiT based de-\ntector has lower latency than detector based on ResNet50 or\nViT-S. Although PiT detector cannot beat the performance\nof the ResNet50 detector, PiT detector has better latency,\nand improvement over ViT-S is signiﬁcant. Additional in-\nvestigation on the training settings for PiT based detectors\nwould improve the performance of the PiT detector.\n4.3. Robustness benchmarks\nIn this subsection, we investigate the effectiveness of the\nproposed architecture in terms of robustness against input\nchanges. We presume that the existing ViT design concept,\nwhich keeps the spatial dimension from the input layer to\nthe last layer, has two conceptual limitations: Lack of back-\nground robustnessand sensitivity to the local discriminative\nvisual features. We, therefore, presume that PiT, our new\ndesign choice with the pooling mechanism, performs better\nthan ViT for the background robustness benchmarks and the\nlocal discriminative sensitivity benchmarks.\nWe employ four different robustness benchmarks. Oc-\nclusion benchmark measures the ImageNet validation ac-\ncuracy where the center 112 ×112 patch of the images\nis zero-ed out. This benchmark measures whether a model\nonly focuses on a small discriminative visual feature or not.\nImageNet-A (IN-A) is a dataset constructed by collecting\nthe failure cases of ResNet50 from the web [15] where the\ncollected images contain unusual backgrounds or objects\nwith very small size [23]. From this benchmark, we can in-\nfer how a model is less sensitive to unusual backgrounds\nor object size changes. However, since IN-A is constructed\nby collecting images (queried by 200 ImageNet subclasses)\nwhere ResNet50 predicts a wrong label, this dataset can\nbe biased towards ResNet50 features. We, therefore, em-\nploy background challenge (BGC) benchmark [40] to ex-\nplore the explicit background robustness. The BGC dataset\nconsists of two parts, foregrounds, and backgrounds. This\nbenchmark measures the model validation accuracy while\nkeeping the foreground but adversarially changing the back-\nground from the other image. Since BGC dataset is built\nupon nine subclasses of ImageNet, the baseline random\nchance is 11.1%. Lastly, we tested adversarial attack robust-\nness using the fast gradient sign method (FGSM) [10].\nTable 6 shows the results. First, we observe that PiT\nshows better performances than ViT in all robustness bench-\nmarks, despite they show comparable performances in the\nstandard ImageNet benchmark (80.8 vs. 79.8). It supports\nthat our dimension design makes the model less sensitive to\nthe backgrounds and the local discriminative features. Also,\nwe found that the performance drops for occluded samples\nby ResNet50 are much dramatic than PiT; 80.8 →74.6,\n5% drops for PiT, 79.0 →67.1, 15% drops for ResNet50.\nThis implies that ResNet50 focuses more on the local dis-\ncriminative areas, by the nature of convolutional operations.\nInterestingly, in Table 6, ResNet50 outperforms ViT vari-\nants in the background challenge dataset (32.7 vs. 21.0).\nThis implies that the self-attention mechanism unintention-\nally attends more backgrounds comparing to ResNet design\nchoice. Overcoming this potential drawback of vision trans-\nformers will be an interesting research direction.\n5. Conclusion\nIn this paper, we have shown that the design principle\nwidely used in CNNs - the spatial dimensional transfor-\nmation performed by pooling or convolution with strides,\nis not considered in transformer-based architectures such\nas ViT; ultimately affects the model performance. We have\nﬁrst studied with ResNet and found that the transformation\nin respect of the spatial dimension increases the computa-\ntional efﬁciency and the generalization ability. To leverage\nthe beneﬁts in ViT, we propose a PiT that incorporates a\npooling layer into Vit, and PiT shows that these advantages\ncan be well harmonized to ViT through extensive experi-\nments. Consequently, while signiﬁcantly improving the per-\nformance of the ViT architecture, we have shown that the\npooling layer by considering spatial interaction ratio is es-\nsential to a self-attention-based architecture.\nAcknowledgement We thank NA VER AI Lab members for\nvaluable discussion and advice.
