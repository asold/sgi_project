    "abstract": "This paper demonstrates a new, promising method using generative artificial intelligence (AI) to augment the educational value of electronic textbooks and research papers (locally stored on user’s machine) and maximize their potential for self-study, in a way that goes beyond the standard electronic search and indexing that is already available in all of these textbooks and files. The presented method runs fully locally on the user’s machine, is generally affordable, and does not require high technical expertise to set up and customize with the user’s own content.",
