It is likely that many incidences of ST in health research remain undocumented for\nreasons of conﬁdentiality.\nEdited by:\nErica Di Ruggiero,\nUniversity of Toronto, Canada\nReviewed by:\nSandra Ribeiro,\nInstituto Superior de Contabilidade e\nAdministracao do Porto, Portugal\n*Correspondence:\nBecky McCall\nbecky.mccall.18@ucl.ac.uk\nReceived: 26 May 2021\nAccepted: 05 October 2021\nPublished: 02 November 2021\nCitation:\nMcCall B, Shallcross L, Wilson M,\nFuller C and Hayward A (2021)\nStorytelling as a Research Tool Used to\nExplore Insights and as an Intervention\nin Public Health: A Systematic\nNarrative Review.\nInt J Public Health 66:1604262.\ndoi: 10.3389/ijph.2021.1604262\nInt J Public Health | Owned by SSPH+ | Published by Frontiers November 2021 | Volume 66 | Article 16042621\nInternational Journal of Public Health\nREVIEW\npublished: 02 November 2021\ndoi: 10.3389/ijph.2021.1604262\nIn many contexts, storytelling might be considered as lying\noutside the arena of entertainment. Lugmayr et al refer to such\n“serious storytelling” as narration that“progresses as a sequence\nof patterns impressive in quality, relates to a serious context, and\nis a matter of thoughtful process.” [7] ST with purpose beyond\nentertainment is one focus of this review, that is, ST as a research\ntool in public health.\nIt also addresses both the development of a story and the\nprocess of telling it. Many ST studies have employed narrative-as-\nmessage (story as text without detail on the process of telling) but\nfew have explored how people identify, craft, and tell their\npersonal stories. Fewer still are studies on the assessment of\nST as a tool for change in knowledge, attitude and, behavior/\npractice (KAB/P).\nST formats vary and include verbal, written,“photovoice” (use\nof photos as prompts), or, increasingly, digital storytelling (DST),\nwhich captures lived personal experiences through the creation of\n3– 5-min digital ﬁlms.\nDST may manifest as digital video, gaming, Instagram stories\n(or “Instastories”), or interactive television as examples. Within\nthe boundaries of this review, DST primarily refers to the\nproduction of a short (3 – 4 min) digital video where\nparticipants craft personal experiences, possibly using photo,\nmusic, and voice recordings [8].\nAs a research tool, ST generates more nuanced, contextualized,\nand culturally-reﬂective information than some other qualitative\nresearch methods, e.g., interview, but it can also be used as an\nintervention to facilitate change in KAB/P. In this respect, the\ntransformative properties of ST can be conceived as relating to the\nstimulation of human emotions to engage with new knowledge\nand, as such, in ﬂuence attitude and ultimately behavior, as\nillustrated by Wong J. P. et al in the prevention of HIV/\nsexually transmitted infections (STIs). ST contextualizes\nhealth-related information to one’s own situation, potentially\nencouraging beneﬁcial behavioral change [9].\nConventionally, social and health research largely uses\nquantitative cross-sectional surveys to measure change in\nKAB/P, while most qualitative work exploring KAB/P involves\ninterviews and/or focus groups. For example, with antimicrobial\nresistance (AMR), most research on the KAB/P adopts health\nbehavior surveys [10], interviews, and focus groups [11, 12]. The\nresearchers are particularly interested in AMR and intend to use\nST as a future research tool on the topic. No studies were\nidentiﬁed using ST to explore AMR.\nST largely remains an emergent research method and its\nvalidity has not been established. However, this does not\njustify dismissing the potential value of ST in this capacity,\nand this review aimed to identify evidence of the validity of\nST as used in the research context whether to gather information\nand/or used as an intervention to change KAB/P.\nIn summary, this systematic review aimed to,ﬁrstly, conduct a\nbasic quantitative evaluation of the distribution of peer-reviewed,\npublished studies that use ST as a research tool across a broad\nrange of public health issues and, secondly, to qualitatively\nanalyze 10 carefully selected studies that use ST as 1) a\nresearch tool to gain insight into KAB/P, and/or 2) an\nintervention to effect change. Essentially, the public health\nissues selected for ﬁnal analysis were de ﬁned as bearing a\npersonal cost in the immediate term but potentially providing\na population-level health beneﬁt in the long-term, for example,\nvaccination or AMR (foregoing an antibiotic in the short-term to\nhelp prevent the development of resistance at a population level\nin the long-term). The review was conducted using the process of\nnarrative synthesis and was designed to inform future research\nusing ST in AMR.\nMETHODS\nSources\nPeer-reviewed and published studies were identiﬁed from eight\nmajor databases: Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, ERIC (Proquest),\nWeb of Science, Art and Humanities database (ProQuest),\nScopus, and Google Scholar. Two librarians aided formulation\nof the search strategies. Key words and synonyms can be found in\nTable 1.\nStudy Selection and Screening\nEndnote reference management software was used to organize\nstudies and systematic review management software (SUMARI)\n[13] aided initial title and abstract screening (BM and CF). Full\ntexts were reviewed and reference lists checked (BM and CF). The\nrecommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic\nReview and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) were followed.\nInclusion Criteria\nThe stage 1, basic, quantitative analysis included all studies that\nmet the following inclusion criteria: qualitative, quantitative, or\nmixed-method, peer-reviewed, primary public health studies\nusing ST within the context of research and in the English\nlanguage; publication 1990– present; all ages and demographic\nbackgrounds; and ST (verbal or written or digital) used as a\nresearch tool to understand and/or effect change in KAB/P.\nThe stage 2, qualitative analysis included studies that primarily\naddressed public health topics involving a personal cost in the\nimmediate term but population-level health beneﬁt in the longer\nterm e.g., HIV involves individual sacriﬁce of testing in the short-\nterm but reduced HIV population-level spread in the long-term.\nThis criterion parallels the nature of AMR– an area of research\ninterest to the authors. Other inclusion criteria are in\nSupplementary File S1.\nDeﬁnitions used in screening and selection were: story– a story\nderived from interviews, role model stories, or narrative accounts;\nstorytelling– DST, “Photovoice”, plays, theatre, or ﬁlm, usually\ninvolves the crafting and telling of a story; and personal\nnarrative– personal experience not formatted as a story.\nExclusion Criteria\nStudies where health was a secondary consideration, or subject\nmatter was more clinical than public health, were excluded.\nCritical Appraisal of Selected Studies\nCritical appraisal of included studies used the 16-item QATSDD\ntool for qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-methods studies [14].\nInt J Public Health | Owned by SSPH+ | Published by Frontiers November 2021 | Volume 66 | Article 16042622\nMcCall et al. Storytelling Public Health Systematic Review\nThis provides a score (0/equalsvery poor, 3/equalsvery good) for each\ncriteria in each study, and an overall score.\nData Extraction and Synthesis\nJBI SUMARI [13] software helped data extraction from the 145\nstudies in the quantitative analysis, and the 10 ﬁnal studies\n(Supplementary Files S2A, S2B respectively). The latter\nincluded phenomena of interest, overall design/methods (using\nST) and analysis, location, setting including context/culture,\nparticipant characteristics, sample size, and description of\nmain results.\nData synthesis used the narrative synthesis approach\ndeveloped by the Economic and Social Research Council\n(ESRC) [15], comprising an initial description of study results\ndescribing patterns observed (preliminary synthesis), followed by\nan exploration of relationships within and between studies, as\nwell as interpretations and possible explanations (narrative\nsynthesis).\nOutcomes\nThe primary outcome was the narrative synthesis review of the 10\nﬁnal studies. Secondary outcomes were drawn from the 145\nstudies for quantitative review and included, for example,\nfrequency of the public health topics by storytelling method,\nthe geographical spread stratiﬁed by topic, and study dates.\nRESULTS\nThe initial search for studies using stories, ST, or personal\nnarrative in the public health arena provided a total of 3,077\nstudies, after removal of duplicates. All of these were title and\nabstract screened (necessary for suf ﬁcient information), and\n2,852 were removed due to the following (Supplementary File\nS3: Reasons for exclusion): being off topic (1072), having an\nunsuitable method (439), subject matter a poor ﬁt for the\ninclusion criteria (1,073), study paper unobtainable or a\nconference abstract only (13) not a primary study (160), or\ntopic not associated with short-term personal sacri ﬁce and\nlong-term population level gain (95). Full text review involved\n216 studies.\nInsert: Figure 1: PRISMA ﬂow chart representing selection\nprocess for the use of storytelling as a tool to extract information\nor as an intervention across a range of public health issues.

United Kingdom, 2021.\nCritical Appraisal of Studies in the Final\nAnalysis\nCritical appraisal of the 10 studies included forﬁnal analysis was\nchallenging due to the heterogeneity of methods and the\nsubjectivity of the qualitative content (8/10 studies contained\nqualitative data only; 2/10 contained qualitative and quantitative\ndata). See Supplementary Files S4A, S4Bfor critical appraisal\nscores.\nEach study was scored according to the relevant criteria.\nQualitative studies were assessed using 13/16 total criteria, while\nmixed-method studies used 16/16 criteria. Qualitative only (8/10\nstudies) generated an overall score of 64%, and mixed method (2/10\nstudies) generated the highest overall score of 70%. The overall score\nfor all studies combined reﬂected a weighting towards qualitative data\nat 66% that drew strength from detailed descriptions of context and\nsetting and articulated thematic descriptions and interpretations.\nStudy Characteristics\nQuantitative Analysis\nOf 145 studies identiﬁed, ST comprised 80/145 (54.8%), story 44/\n145 (30.1%), and personal narrative 21/145 (14.4%) as research\ntools to address a total of 16 public health topics.\nCancer/cancer screening comprised most studies 32/145\n(22.1%) matched by HIV 32/145 (22.1%); the remaining\nTABLE 1 |Search terms comprised of concepts and synonyms (broadly based on PICO), United Kingdom, 2021.\nPICO (adapted from) Intervention Context (comparator) Outcome\nConcepts Storytelling Public health Attitude*\nSynonyms Story Health information Knowledge\nStories Health education Behaviour*\nNarrative* Health communication Perception*\nMisperception*\nMisinformation*\nNarration Health behaviour* Belief*\nScreening Value*\nHIV or HIV/AIDS Perception*\nVaccination or vaccine*\n“Climate change”\nCancer\nObesity or overweight\nSmoking or “smoking cessation”\n“Sexual health” or “sexually transmitted\ninfection*” or STI* or STD*\n“Antimicrobial resistance” or “AMR” or “antibiotic\nresistance” Antimicrobi* or antibiotic*\nResistan*\n“Drug resistan*”\nInt J Public Health | Owned by SSPH+ | Published by Frontiers November 2021 | Volume 66 | Article 16042623\nMcCall et al. Storytelling Public Health Systematic Review\nstudies focused on mental health 10/145 (6.8%), cardiovascular\nhealth 8/145 (5.5%), and vaccination 8/145 (5.5%). No studies\nreferred to AMR.\nAnalysis by study location showed that 69/145 (47.6%) were\nbased in the United States (US), 22/145 (152%) in Africa, 20/145\n(13.8%) in Canada, 18/145 (12.4%) in Europe, 9/145 (6.2%) in\nAustralasia, and only 4/145 (2.8%) in the United Kingdom (UK).\nStudy dates showed a leap in the number of studies from 8 in\n2001– 2005, to 26 in 2006– 2010, and then doubling to 57 studies\nin 2011– 2015 and 49 in 2016– 2019 seeTable 2for a breakdown\nof quantitative ﬁndings.\nFinal Qualitative Analysis of 10 Storytelling Studies\nStudy Characteristics\nThe 10 studies included in theﬁnal analysis all used ST as a\nqualitative research method. Two papers referred to one study,\nbut were distinct enough to be counted as two studies [16, 17].\nUse of ST was heterogeneous: as an intervention to effect change\nin 7/10 studies [18– 22], and as a means to extract information (3/\n10) [23– 25]. Topics included HIV (5/10 studies) [18, 20, 22, 23,\n25], sexual and reproductive health (3/10) [16, 17, 24], climate\nchange (1/10) [21], and emergency care of croup (1/10) [19]. Of\nthe studies, three out of ten used DST [16, 17, 25], two out of ten\nemployed a professional storyteller to craft and perform\nparticipants’ stories [19, 22], two employed ST by written\nword [21, 24], and three used verbal ST [18, 20, 23]. Two out\nof ten studies used mixed methods using both quantitative and\nqualitative data [16, 17] while eight primarily used qualitative\ndata only [18– 25]. The locations used were Uganda (1/10) [24],\nthe US (3/10); [16, 17, 20], Canada (3/10) [19, 21, 23], and South\nAfrica (3/10) [18, 22, 25]. Participant numbers ranged from six to\n200, with most involving around 25– 30 participants. See\nTable 3\nfor key characteristics of the 10 studies andSupplementary File\nS5 for the list of studies forﬁnal analysis.\nThe Process of Storytelling\nConsiderable heterogeneity in ST methods remained within the\n10 ﬁnal studies. ST involves a process of triggering participant\nFIGURE 1 |PRISMA ﬂow chart representing selection process for the use of storytelling as a tool to extract information or as an intervention across a range of public\nhealth issues.

Storytelling Public Health Systematic Review\nmemories and crafting these into a story, e.g., in the climate change\nstudy, participants jotted down memories of personal experiences\nwhich were incorporated into their story [21]. Thought-mapping\n(nodes representing feelings, thoughts, and actions with lines\nbetween them denoting cause and effect) was a technique used\nto stimulate thinking around risk-taking behaviors [20].\nProxy characters including cards featuring characters of\nsimilar demographic to participants or animals instead of\nhumans were used [22, 24]. South African miners aimed to\ndispel HIV stigma by gathering 300 local myths and using\nthem to inform stories [18]. Images recorded pivotal moments\nto aid DST [17].\nStorytelling as Agent of Change or\nExploratory Tool\nThe majority (7/10) of studies served to both extract information\nand serve as an intervention.\nThe study exploring young Ugandan men’s attitudes towards\nmultiple sexual partners (MSP) mainly sourced insights but\nbrieﬂy touched on intervention [ 24]. Changing the stigma\naround HIV/AIDS and STIs was central to a number of\nTABLE 2 |Number of studies by public health topic, geographical region, and\ndates of studies, United Kingdom, 2021.\n(A) Study count by public health topic.\nPublic health topic Count of Public\nhealth topic (%)\nAlcohol and drug abuse 1 (0.7%)\nCancer 32 (22.1%)\nCardiovascular health 8 (5.5%)\nChronic disease 1 (0.7%)\nClimate change 3 (2.1%)\nDiabetes 7 (4.8%)\nHIV 32 (22.1%)\nMental health 10 (6.9%)\nNutrition 4 (2.8%)\nObesity 6 (4.1%)\nOther 19 (13.1%)\nPhysical activity 2 (1.4%)\nRare disease 1 (0.7%)\nReproductive and sexual health 7 (4.8%)\nSmoking 4 (2.8%)\n(B) Study count by geographical region and public health topic.\nGeographic region and\npublic health topic\nCount of studies\nby region and\ntopic\nAfrica 22 (15.2%)\nHIV 17\nOther 2\nReproductive and sexual health 2\nSmoking 1\nAsia 3 (2.1%)\nMental health 1\nOther 1\nVaccination 1\nAustralasia 9 (6.2%)\nChronic disease 1\nHIV 1\nMental health 3\nNutrition 1\nOther 2\nSmoking 1\nCanada 20 (13.8%)\nCancer 3\nClimate change 3\nDiabetes 1\nHIV 5\nObesity 1\nOther 4\nPhysical activity 2\nSmoking 1\nEurope 18 (12.4%)\nCancer 4\nDiabetes 2\nMental health 2\nObesity 2\nOther 4\nRare disease 1\nReproductive and sexual health 1\nSmoking 1\nVaccination 1\nSouth America 1 (0.7%)\n(Continued in next column)\nTABLE 2 |(Continued) Number of studies by public health topic, geographical\nregion, and dates of studies, United Kingdom, 2021.\n(B) Study count by geographical region and public health topic.\nGeographic region and\npublic health topic\nCount of studies\nby region and\ntopic\nCancer 1\nUnited Kingdom 3 (2.1%)\nMental health 2\nOther 1\nHIV 1\nUS 69 (47.6%)\nAlcohol and drug abuse 1\nCancer 24\nCardiovascular health 8\nDiabetes 4\nHIV 8\nMental health 2\nNutrition 3\nObesity 3\nOther 5\nReproductive and sexual health 4\nVaccination 6\nGrand Total 145\n(C) Dates of studies in 5-years brackets.\nRow labels Count of 5-years date\nbracket\n1996– 2000 3\n2001– 2005 8\n2006– 2010 26\n2011– 2015 57\n2016– 2020 49\n2021– 2025 2\n*United Kingdom separated from Europe because it is a country of special interest to the\nauthors.\nInt J Public Health | Owned by SSPH+ | Published by Frontiers November 2021 | Volume 66 | Article 16042625\nMcCall et al.

Storytelling Public Health Systematic Review\nof STIs/HIV risk. Instead they felt that having MSP asserted their\nmasculinity through entrenched cultural views, and this was the\ndominant factor in determining their health outcomes [24].\nST with respect to mitigating climate change uncovered\nvarious social, cultural, and structural barriers to taking action\nin the everyday lives of the residents of Saskatchewan, Canada.\nFor example, the authors write“dissonance may result from a lack\nof perceived power to intervene meaningfully through individual\nroles,” such as struggling toﬁnd meaning behind personal actions\nwhich seemed insigniﬁcant given the scale and scope of the\nchallenge of climate change.\nA study exploring HIV stigma in South Africa used ST as an\nintervention in clinic waiting rooms to open a dialogue on the\nissue [22]. Interestingly, the stories generated by South African\nminers based on dispelling myths could easily be sharedvia word\nof mouth (effectively, via the same communication route that\nspread the misinformation initially) [18].\nST Aims, Methods, and Analysis of Stories\nOnly one study explicitly articulated a clear aim to their ST\nresearch project, comprising the use of stories as booklets to help\npatients understand the management of croup in the emergency\ndepartment [19]. The aims of other studies were less clear but\nincluded informing future policy, e.g., on climate change [21], or\nsexual health/HIV [23], and improving understanding around\nhealth risks of unprotected sex and HIV risks of injectable drug\nuse [20].\nThematic analysis was used by 8/10 studies to identify\ncommon themes across a number of stories [16, 17, 21– 25].\nOther methods of analysis included visual text analysis [25];\ncoding using participant input to develop over-riding themes\n[23]; analyses of descriptive statistics e.g., age, gender, and\nbirthplace from surveys [ 16, 17]; and content analysis – the\npresence, meanings, and relationships between certain words,\nthemes, or concepts to analyze a story about croup [19]. The\nstudy on climate change identiﬁed points of narrative dissonance\n(barriers) and narrativeﬁdelity (facilitators) in the ST data to help\nframe challenges, choices, and outcomes regarding climate\nchange action [21].\nDISCUSSION\nIn determining the value of ST as a qualitative research method in\npublic health, a narrative synthesis was conducted.\nFrameworks to guide the use of ST in research were noticeably\nabsent across most studies, other than one used by Ganz in the\nstudy on climate change, which referred to the nestling of\npersonal stories within public narratives based on relationships\nwith others, cultural context, and shared values to convey\nmeaning [21].\nStorytelling’s Value in Extracting\nInformation and Insights on KAB/P\nST elicits nuanced information and emotions that might be\ninaccessible via other means of qualitative or quantitative\ninvestigation, especially given the personal and public\nsensitivities around some topics e.g., HIV stigma. ST can\nreveal subtle insights on behavior e.g., those related to STI/\nHIV in Inuit communities that found men in the community\nwere the hard-to-reach ones (for public health messages) and who\nlacked the social networks that women have through sewing\ngroups and ante-natal groups [23]. Young men in Uganda at high\nrisk for HIV through a lifestyle with MSP were more concerned\nabout things that challenge their pleasure and masculinity than\nhealth risks, possibly indicating a need to consider gender power\ndynamics in any potential health intervention [24].\nStorytelling’s Value as an Intervention to\nChange KAB/P\nFollow-up time, across all studies, was too short to draw\nconclusions about the impact of ST in changing KAB/P.\nChanging behavior over the short and long-term is complex\nand any evaluation would need to reﬂect that [26].\nHowever, marked positive effects of group ST were\ndocumented in the studies by Difulvio, Gubrium, Leukefeld,\nand Dickinson: women in the studies by Difulvio and\nGubrium reported feeling enhanced positivity when telling\ntheir own story in a group setting, feeling less socially isolated,\ndiscovering more empathy, and, in particular, having the\nopportunity to have their voices heard [ 16, 17]. Likewise,\npositive change in KAB/P in probationers was reported, as\nstructured ST led to insights into personal behavior that\nsometimes resonated with others [20].\nAll participants in the 10 studies were members of\nmarginalized groups, and insights into the beneﬁts of ST in\nchanging KAB/P speaks to the ﬁnding elsewhere that\nmarginalized groups often reap optimal bene ﬁt from ST\nactivities. Researchers ﬁnd personal stories can illuminate the\nnuances and the human aspects that underpin challenging social\nissues often involving marginalized groups [27].\nDickinson deﬁnes stories as agents of change that have the\npower to overcome stalemates around KAB/P relating to stigma,\nmisunderstanding, and myths around HIV and AIDS [18].\nThe Storytelling Process and its Value as a\nUnique Research Tool\nThe 10 studies revealed that multiple processes could be followed\nto elicit a meaningful story.\nSensitivities around the public health topic of concern, as well\ndemographics and cultural and/or social norms, were all\ninstrumental in determining the nature of the ST process\nfollowed, including the actors deployed. Use of a professional\nstoryteller can facilitate interactions around sensitive topics, e.g.,\nZeelen used a professional storyteller who created dialogues between\nanimals as a metaphor for real people discussing HIV stigma in their\ncommunity. Arguably, use of an intermediary agent might diminish\nthe authenticity of the story eventually told because stories can\nadopt a new form with each telling. That stories are multiplicities,\nand ST is temporary in nature, whereby stories resist deﬁnition and\ndocumentation, is supported by core ST literature [28].\nInt J Public Health | Owned by SSPH+ | Published by Frontiers November 2021 | Volume 66 | Article 160426210\nMcCall et al. Storytelling Public Health Systematic Review\nThe signiﬁcance of story authenticity also played out with\nrespect to the inherent conﬂict between the accuracy of medical\ncontent versus authenticity of a personal story in the study on\nchildren with croup, where details around an X-ray were omitted\nfor not being standard clinical practice [19].\nThe study in South African ante-natal clinic waiting rooms\nused a storyteller who knew the local language and culture, and\nreferred to local animals to help listeners ﬁnd meaning and\ninternalize the messages about protective health behavior\nrather than just receive information, as per the information\ndeﬁcit model of imparting knowledge [ 29]. Joshi overcame\ninhibitions around discussing MSP and risk of HIV/STIs by\nusing written stories and proxy characters [24].\nST reveals insights not necessarily accessible by other means,\ne.g., subtle cultural in ﬂuences in health decision-making,\nproviding something potentially additive to other qualitative or\nquantitative research. The study on climate change unearthed\nhow barriers manifest within the narratives of people who appear\nto accept climate science, uncovering novel nuances of emotional\nand moral reasoning, and insights that might not have been\nreadily available via other research methods [21].\nThought-mapping used with ST around drug use and sexual\npractices helped participants work through problems and\nsolutions/strategies, providing the opportunity to create an\nalternative, more positive story end [20].\nData from the study by Gubrium supports the role of qualitative\ndata as complementary to quantitative data. The author argues for\nthe importance of reﬂecting the“locally grounded, felt experiences”\nof participants, as current quantitative scales do not measure up to\naccurately capture these effects [17].\nThe majority of studies in the quantitative review (145 studies)\nwere from a chronic disease background that play out over an\nextended period of time, e.g., HIV and cancer together that\ncomprised the majority of public health topics covered, followed\nby mental health. The quantitative analysis also showed that most\nstudies were conducted in the US (47.6%) with cancer and cancer\nscreening being most often studied (24/68 studies), possibly\nreﬂecting a dominant health concern in that country.\nCardiovascular health featured in only 8/68 studies, possibly\nsuggesting a trend for ST in some areas of public health and scope\nto extend the range of public health areas which use ST as a\nresearch tool.\nFinally, the study by Rand illustrates how ST and stories forge\na bridge between the intricate realities of everyday lives\n(qualitative research) and quantitative epidemiology to\nprovide both a close-up and wider view of the public health\nissue at stake and ultimately h elp formulate more effective\npublic health interventions [23].\nST Lends Itself to Teasing out Nuanced\nPersonal Experience\nST thrives on the nuances and non-explicit inﬂuences of cultural\nor ethnic nature. Here, studies featured participants deﬁned by\nsocial deprivation, employment status, criminal record, local\nprevalence of HIV, teenage pregnancy or STIs, and\ndescriptions of community hierarchies, to name a few.\nMany of the ST cohorts belonged to hard-to-reach or vulnerable\ncommunities, for example, the probationers in rural Kentucky, US, of\nwhom 61% had a history of drug convictions [20], or the teenage\nPuerto Rican women from an inner city in New England, US [16, 17].\nSensitive or controversial topics frequently form the focus of\nST research projects because discussion around them is often\navoided in communities precipitating misunderstanding and\nstigma. ST among probationers created a secure space for\nopen discussion of drug use and HIV risk [20]. In the study\nin African ante-natal clinics, ST facilitated access to otherwise\nhard-to-reach members of the community [22].\nChoice of facilitators and storytellers was also found to inﬂuence\nST success. In the Inuit study, the workshop facilitator, a local\nsettler and resident, had an ingrained understanding of the cultural\nnuances of participants’lives, e.g., importantly, highly revered Inuit\nelders were included in the ST study [23].\nStories in the study of ART adherence in South Africa drew on\ncultural references and social norms, e.g., a belief that HIV\nmedication echoes a subtheme around armed struggle, which\nalludes to the historicalﬁght in South Africa against Apartheid.\nWeaponry was also referred to in the struggle to defeat HIV [25].\nPrior reference to drawing on culture to tailor narrative\nresearch to the study population is made by Larkey and Hecht\nwith their culture-centric, narrative theory-Narrative\nCommunication Prevention Model [ 30]. This refers to how\npeople structure reality, including health decisions, by telling\nstories that tap into implicit local cultural values and codes. This\napproach through the medium of ST can be more effective at\nreaching certain audiences who might be less involved, or even\nresistant to, the relevant message, and that narrative or ST might\nappeal where information provision does not.\nLimitations of ST as a Research Method\nThe ‘validity’of data generated by the studies is fundamental to the\nuse of ST as a research tool, but interpretation of the term“validity”\nas used in qualitative studies is a challenging concept. Noble et al.\nparallel reliability and “consistency” with trustworthiness,\nsuggesting a need for clarity around the methods undertaken\nwith a “decision-trail” that is transparent enough for\nreproducibility. In the 10 studies chosen for ﬁnal qualitative\nreview, few studies satisﬁed these requirements. Gubrium came\nclosest to a measure of trustworthiness or validity of the qualitative\nST data generated by cross-referencingﬁndings to a variety of data\nsources, for example, transcripts of key DST activities, individual\ninterviews with participants, ﬁeld notes from workshops, and\nworkshop evaluations [17].\nTreffry-Goatley attempted to“validate” storytelling by using\ntriangulation with drawings and music [25].\nThe value of ST resides in taking the data on their own merit,\nwithout generalizing, unlike quantitative research. However, the\nstudy by Hartling demonstrates how authenticity can be lost in\nthe effort to meet project objectives, when the story was modiﬁed\nto ﬁt the end purpose-an information booklet [19].\nMost ST studies lacked rigorous follow-up and evaluation even\nover the short term. Going forward, if ST is to be recognized as an\neffective research method, especially within health and medicine,\nfar greater emphasis needs to be placed on evaluation. Some\nInt J Public Health | Owned by SSPH+ | Published by Frontiers November 2021 | Volume 66 | Article 160426211\nMcCall et al. Storytelling Public Health Systematic Review\nquantitative analysis might have value in assessing the impact of\nST as a tool for research or as an intervention, as seen in the\nstudies by Gubrium and Difulvio [16, 17]. Generally, health and\nmedical research lends to quantitative analysis, e.g., assessing\nchange in a certain clinical parameter, but in contrast, ST often\ncomprises an individual’s perceived truth, and as such it is\ndifﬁcult to construct a measure of such a variable entity.\nStrengths and Limitations of this Systematic\nReview\nThis review has several strengths. It was conducted transparently,\nfollowing established guidelines and a prospectively speciﬁed\nprotocol. Multiple databases were searched – covering science,\nhumanities, and arts. To reduce the risk of missing relevant\nstudies, two reviewers were involved (BM and CF).\nLimitations to this review include that the topics entered into\nthe full review (stage 2) had to satisfy the key criterion of short-\nterm personal sacriﬁce with long-term population level gain in\norder to reﬂect aspects of the public health scenario presented by\nAMR. This excluded many studies that may have contained\nvaluable information on ST process and value. ST is also a\nbroad term that might have included stories as toldvia social\nmedia or in the mainstream and specialist media. This review was\nlimited to the telling of personal stories.\nA few studies using story, ST, or personal narrative were found\nin the last 18– 24 months and were included in the quantitative\nanalysis, for example, a study on beliefs and intentions behindﬂu\nvaccination uptake, however, none of these met the tight criteria\nfor the ﬁnal selection.\nConclusion\nThis review found evidence to support ST as having inherent\nvalue in revealing nuanced insights on a wide variety of public\nhealth topics and played an active role in participants making\nsense of real-life events and changing KAB/P. The review found\nmost ST studies relate to chronic conditions, speciﬁcally HIV and\ncancer/cancer screening. By uncovering subtle inﬂuences on the\ndevelopment of KAB/P, ST lends itself to intractable public health\nissues that are strongly inﬂuenced by peripheral factors e.g., social\nnorms and culture, speciﬁc to different communities.\nAlso, the review suggests that ST could play a more robust and\nformalized role in public health research. However, in this respect\nmuch greater attention is needed in ensuring solid evaluation of\nST studies. The value of ST as additive to other qualitative and\nquantitative data cannot be overstated if a fully rounded and\nbalanced perspective on a public health situation is sought to\neither inform an intervention or to serve as an intervention itself.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nThe study was conceived by BM. BM developed the eligibility\ncriteria, search strategy, risk of bias assessment strategy, and data\nextraction plan with guidance from AH, LS, and MW. Search and\nscreening were conducted by BM and CF helped at the full-text\nreview stage. BM wrote the manuscript, to which all authors\ncontributed.\nFUNDING\nMedical Research Foundation (MRF) grant number MRF-145-\n0004-TPG-AVISO.\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST\nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the\nabsence of any commercial or ﬁnancial relationships that\ncould be construed as a potential conﬂict of interest.\nSUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL\nThe Supplementary Material for this article can be found online at:\nhttps://www.ssph-journal.org/articles/10.3389/ijph.2021.1604262/\nfull#supplementary-material\nREFERENCES\n1.
