Introduction \nOil-immersed power transformers form an integral part in the \ncontinuous operation of the South African power grid. Retaining \nthe continuous operation of power transformer is thereby a critical \nissue for the power utility for the reason that any operational  \nmalfunction leads to loss of revenue. On that account, scheduled \nmaintenance contributes to preventing transformer failures and \npower outages. A large percentage of transformer failures is \ncontributed by the damage of the insulation materials, which is \ncomposed of insulating oil and cellulose paper [1-5].   \nThe decomposition process of transformer insulating materials \namplify at higher hotspot temperature, presence of oxygen and \nproduction of moisture. The examination of the transformer \ninsulation conditio n can be established by diagnostic methods \namong which includes DGA [5 , 6], DP by measuring furan \ncompounds [7, 8], or Gel permeation chromatography [9, 10]. \nFurfural analysis has gained immense popularity in the South \nAfrican transformer manufacturing industry in the evaluation of \nthe strength of ins ulating cellulose paper and corresponding \nremnant service lifetime. Furans are the derived products of the \ndecomposition of the cellulose paper that  disseminate into the \ntransformer oil. In measuring the furan concentration on the \ntransformer oil, then the cellulose paper conditions can be \nascertained. A rigorous method to assess the tensile strength in the \ncellulose paper that is intricately connected to cellulose insulation \nstrength of a transformer is  unearthing the Degree of \nPolymerization (DP) of the insulation. However, it is infeasible to \nobtain the paper samples from a transformer  that is in -service, \nparticularly paper samples in winding hotspot areas that are \ntypically localized in the centre of the transformer steel tank. A \nnumber of researchers [11 –14] have concluded that there is a \nremarkable connection between the DP and furan concentration, \nspecifically 2-Furaldehyde (2FAL). The benefit of analysing the \n2FAL concentration correlated to the DP is that the transformer oil \nsamples can be appropriately  extracted from the unit in- service \nwithout engendering any impairment to the transformer.      \nThe most common procedure in measuring Furanic compounds \nin the transformer oil is recommended by  the standard published \nin [15]. In view of the fact that  this procedure necessitates \nparticular expertise and high-end equipment, utility owners and \nmanufacturers subcontract the Furan test to certified  service \nenterprises.

The \nresults indicate an error of estimate of less than 2% and 1% of the \nproposed logarithmic and polynomial fit DP models against the \nmeasured DP respectively.  \n2. Furan compounds mechanism   \nThe Furan compounds present in the transformer oil that can \nbe measured by the High- Performance Liquid Chromatography \n(HPLC) are namely the  2FAL, 2-Furfurol (2FOL), 5 -Hyroxy \nmethyl-2-furfural (5 HMF), 5Methyl-2-Furfural (5MEF), and 2 -\nacetylfuran (2ACF) as demonstrated in Figure 2 [16]. \n \nFigure 2: Furan compounds present in the transformer oil.  \nIt is widely adopted  the Furans are triggered from the \ndecomposition of cellulose insulating material during the course of \nthe transformer operational lifetime.   \nIn s everal researches  from the literature, case studies of \ntransformer diagnostic status have been  presented where the \nmeasured concentration of the furan in oil is employed as a key \nperformance indicator  of the chemical decomposition of the \ninsulating cellulo se paper.  Evaluation of the results  of furan \nanalysis may be implemented with other assessments such as the \nmonitoring of in-service transformer insulating oil and winding \ntemperatures. As a result of  intricacy of the cellulose \ndecomposition mechanics  and plethora of  factors that can \ninfluence the process, the correlation between the 2FAL  \nconcentration and the service life of the transformer is not fully \nunravelled. Based on field experience , the factors that have a \nmaterial impact on the composition of 2FAL in the transformer \ninsulation oil are summarized below:  \n• The commencing 2FAL concentration i n the transformer oil \nis characterised by the ratio of the generation/decomposition \nrate to a particular temperature;  \n• The o ccupancy of moisture considerably affect the \ndissemination of furan compounds  between insulating \ncellulose and oil . The foregoing espouse the 2FAL  \ncomposition;  \n• The winding temperature allures  the formation / \ndecomposition of 2FAL. The variability of the operating \ntemperature as a result of miscellaneous  loading conditions \nsubstantially affect the formation of furans;  \n• Types of transformer oil are also critical on the formulation of \n2FAL. Oxidation inhibitors  have a particular  safeguarding \neffect on cellulose thermoset and triggers the deceleration of \nfuran compounds in comparison with non-additive oils; \n• Thermally upgraded paper generate minimal quantity of furan \ncompounds than standard Kraft paper in oil; \n• Types of transformer (cellulose/oil ratio) and cooling state is \nof paramount importance. Accruing the quantity of cellulose \nadd up to the composition of furans;   \n• Oil reclamation bring about a lower furan content throughout \na lapse of time. However, as a chemical equilibrium, the initial \n2FAL concentration will be attained once more. \nSeveral studies  have been published i n modelling the \ninterrelation between the oil 2FAL concentration and the DP of \ncellulose material.  A universal correlation that is endorsed by the \ntransformer manufacturing industry is  presently not  available. \nNevertheless, there is a common characteristic on the models \nproposed by authors in [17– 21], which concludes that there is a \ncorrelation between the 2FAL concentration and the DP of \ncellulose. Other furan compounds such as 2FOL, 5HMF, 5MEF, \nand 2ACF are more erratic than 2FAL and tend to decompose \nrapidly.  \nTable 1 depicts the DP models that are employed in the \ncomparison approach to substantiate the proposed models . The \nproposed Eq. (6) and Eq. (7) above are formulated based on \nlogarithmic and polynomial fit regression models using furan \nanalysis data collected from a fleet of mineral oil -filled \ntransformers, particularly in the South African network. These \nmodels show excellent correlation coefficient ( 𝑅𝑅²) between the \n2FAL concentration and the DP of cellulose with the polynomial \nfit model having an improved 𝑅𝑅². A graphical of these models and \nexisting models is then demonstrated as shown in Figure 3.  \n\nB.A. Thango et al. / Advances in Science, Technology and Engineering Systems Journal Vol. 6, No. 6, 29-33 (2021) \nwww.astesj.com     31 \nTable 1: Various DP models \nEq.

Case Study: South African oil-immersed transformers \nIn this section, the sample results of furan analysis of five  \ntransformers are presented.  The DP has been measured for each \nof the case studies. At glance, transformer #5 has the lowest 2FAL \nconcentration with a slightly higher measured DP, which suggest \nthis unit is older than the other units. Additionally, transformer #2 \nhas a higher 2FAL value and lowest measured DP. \nTable 3: Service lifetime parameters \n# 2FAL Measured DP \n1 1,563 408 \n2 0,231 648 \n3 1,601 405 \n4 1,778 393 \n5 2,377 351 \nIn Table 4, the proposed models in Eq. (6) and Eq. (7) to evaluate \nthe amount of DP in the transformer insulating cellulose paper are \ncompared with measured data and other models in the literature. \nThe comparison will be carried out based upon the error of \nestimated of the estimated and measured samples.  \nTable 5 presents the error of estimate of some case studies \nusing Eq. (6) and Eq. (7) and other DP models from the literature. \nThe 5 cases in Table 3 are employed to examine the accuracy of \nEq. (6) and Eq. (7). Only one case (Case 2) shows a slightly higher \nerror of estimate against the measured data, but all the cases for \nEq. (6) and Eq. ( 7) are less than 2% and 1 % respectively. The \nerror of estimates for Chendong are less than 8%, Dong less than \n12% except for higher case  (case 2), Vaurchex has less than 29% \nand De Pablo less than 17%.      \nTable 4: Degree of Polymerization \n# 2FAL Measured \nDP \nThango (Eq. 6) Thango (Eq. 7) Chendong Dong Vaurchex De Pablo \n1 1,563 408 401 406 376 360 491 479 \n2 0,231 648 637 676 613 543 660 731 \n3 1,601 405 398 403 373 357 489 474 \n4 1,778 393 385 390 360 347 480 454 \n5 2,377 351 349 349 324 319 454 396 \n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n1200\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nDegree of Polymerization\n2FAL (ppm)\nProposed (Logarithmic) Proposed (Polynomial)\nChendong Dong\nVaurchex De Pablo\nB.A. Thango et al. / Advances in Science, Technology and Engineering Systems Journal Vol. 6, No. 6, 29-33 (2021) \nwww.astesj.com     32 \nTable 5: Error of estimate (Degree of Polymerization) \n# Thango (Eq. 6) Thango (Eq. 7) Chendong Dong Vaurchex De Pablo \n1 2% 1% 8% 12% 20% 17% \n2 2% 4% 5% 16% 2% 13% \n3 2% 1% 8% 12% 21% 17% \n4 2% 1% 8% 12% 22% 15% \n5 0% 1% 8% 9% 29% 13% \nTable 6: Remnant Service Lifetime \n# 2FAL Measured \nDP \nThango (Eq. 6) Thango (Eq. 7) Chendong Dong Vaurchex De Pablo \n1 1,563 20,33 20,68 20,46 22,01 22,92 16,53 17,05 \n2 0,231 10,85 11,18 9,97 11,98 14,47 10,46 8,38 \n3 1,601 20,48 20,83 20,60 22,17 23,05 16,62 17,25 \n4 1,778 21,10 21,51 21,27 22,90 23,64 17,02 18,16 \n5 2,377 23,42 23,51 23,54 25,06 25,35 18,15 20,97 \nTable 7: Percentage Remnant Service Lifetime (Eq. 9) \nTable 8: Percentage Remnant Service Lifetime (Eq. 10) \n# 2FAL Measured \nDP \nThango (Eq. 6) Thango (Eq. 7) Chendong Dong Vaurchex De Pablo \n1 1,563 51,43 50,21 50,99 45,54 42,33 64,79 62,99 \n2 0,231 84,80 83,62 87,89 80,83 72,05 86,18 93,49 \n3 1,601 50,90 49,68 50,47 44,97 41,86 64,48 62,28 \n4 1,778 48,73 47,29 48,13 42,41 39,80 63,09 59,08 \n5 2,377 40,58 40,24 40,12 34,80 33,77 59,12 49,20 \n \nAfter examining the veracity of Eq. (6) and Eq. (7)  to evaluate \nthe DO, the remnant service lifetime of the insulating cellulose \npaper was establish ed,  at which point , the studied transformers \nwas determined by applying Eq. (8). Table 6 shows the \ncorresponding remnant service lifetime of the transformer.  \nTable 7 and Table 8 demonstrate the percentage remnant \nservice lifetime of the 5 cases in Table 6. The results indicate that \nthere is an inversely proportionate relationship between the \npercentage remnant service lifetime and the 2FAL concentration \nwhile a directly proportional relationship is observed against the \ndegree of polymerization.  The results of the percentage remnant \nservice lifetime by applying Eq. (9) is tabulated below.  \nAn increase in the 2FAL concentration results in the decrease \nof the degree of polymerization  and consequently the \ntransformer’s remnant in-service lifetime. The degree of \npolymerization of insulating cellulose paper  is high for newly \nmanufactured transformers ranging above 800 to 1200 and the \ncellulose paper with decomposition activity due to the operational \nconditions will decrease radically until it reaches a DP of about \n2000 where the unit must be removed from service as it indicates \nend of lifespan. Subsequently, the results of the percentage \nremnant service lifetime by applying Eq. (10) is tabulated. \nBased on the results presented in Table 7 and Table 8, it can be \nobserved and concluded that the proposed Eq. (6) and Eq. (7) may \nbe adopted by local manufactures to reliably evaluate the remnant \nin-service lifetime of transformers connected to the South African \ngrid. Results of Chendong, Dong, Vaurchex and De Pablo are  \nerratic in evaluating the transformer service life.  \n4. Conclusion \nExamination of cellulose paper in transformers is highly \ncomplex when the unit is in -service, consequently chemical tests \nwere conducted to survey the condition of the insulating cellulose \npaper. The degree of polymerization was wielded as a key \nbenchmark for evaluating the condition of the cellulose paper by \nmeasuring the Furan (2FAL)  concentration. A statistical survey  \nthrough logarithmic and poly nomial fit regression models was \nrealized to develop the prognosis equations allying the degree of \npolymerization and the measured 2FAL concentration.  The \nstatistical survey  results demonstrated that there is a high \ncorrelation between the cellulose DP and the 2FAL concentration, \n# 2FAL Measured \nDP \nThango (Eq. 6) Thango (Eq. 7) Chendong Dong Vaurchex De Pablo \n1 1,563 48,55 49,77 48,99 54,44 57,66 35,19 37,00 \n2 0,231 15,18 16,36 12,09 19,16 27,93 13,81 6,50 \n3 1,601 49,09 50,31 49,51 55,02 58,12 35,51 37,70 \n4 1,778 51,26 52,69 51,85 57,58 60,18 36,89 40,90 \n5 2,377 59,41 59,74 59,86 65,18 66,21 40,87 50,79 \nB.A. Thango et al. / Advances in Science, Technology and Engineering Systems Journal Vol. 6, No. 6, 29-33 (2021) \nwww.astesj.com     33 \nyielding correlation coefficients of 0.9809 and 0. 9913 for the \nproposed models.   \nThe results of the studied cases inveterate that the 2FAL \nconcentration is a suitable index  for predicting the degree of \npolymerization. By comparing the proposed models in Eq. (6) and \nEq. (7) with the DP models in the literature , the results revealed \nthat the proposed DP models based on South African transformers \nto be an excellent measure of the degree of polymerization at \nwhich point the remnant and percentage service lifetime of the \nunits can be evaluated.
