Introduction \n \nBased on piezoelectric materi als, piezoelectric trans- \nformers were invented as a combination of an actuator and \na transducer which have been used widely with the name \nof Rosen-type transformer. While conventional magnetic \ntransformers use a magnetic field as a medium for energy \ntransformation, piezoelectric transformers utilize a \nmechanical vibration with a dvantages such as higher \nefficiency, miniaturization, absence of electro- magnetic \nnoise, and nonflammability [1–5]. These benefits have led \npiezoelectric transformers to be  studied and applied in the \ndevelopment of smart grid and green technology to meet \nrequirements such as effective energy utilization, reduction \nof global warming, and environ- mental protection. These \ntransformers can be used for DC/AC or AC/DC converters, \nbattery chargers, power supply for display, and air cleaners. \nAlthough rectangular-shaped Rosen-type piezoelectric \ntransformers are still being ap plied for step-up commercial \napplications, various types of piezoelectric transformers \nusing different vibration modes have been proposed and \ndeveloped to obtain higher power and smaller size [6–10].  \nFinite Element Method (F EM) and electro-mechanical \nplumped equivalent circuit model have been used to \nanalyze piezoelectric transformers. Many significant design \naspects such as shape, elect rode pattern, and electrode \nposition, can only be investigated with the FEM technique. \nFEM modeling efforts for piezo electric transformers have \nbeen studied on the Rosen-type, ring-shaped type, circular \ntype, and unipoled disk-type using software such as ATILA, \nANSYS, and NTUPZE [11–15]. ATILA was utilized \neffectively in the simulation of new piezoelectric \ntransformers due to its simplifications in importing data \nand showing results [16]. \nOne of the most important factors affecting piezoelectric \ntransformers is temperature; hence, piezoelectric material \nand construction should be improved to obtain \ntransformers with higher power at lower normal \ntemperature increase. Internal losses are the heat generated \nwhich leads to the increased temperature of piezoelectric \ntransformers, especially in high power, and the change in \ntransformer characteristics. In previous research reports, \nthe effects of temperature on piezoelectric material \nparameters were mentioned, but temperature distribution \nwas not focused on [17]. \nIn this work, the modeling of a square-shaped multilayer \nstep-down piezoelectric transf ormer with a central hole \nbefore the fabrication was studied using A TILA software. \nFirst, the parameters of hard piezoelectric ceramic were \nmeasured from fabricated spec imens and inserted into the \nsimulation. The effects of frequency and load resistance on \nthe electrical properties were  also studied. Temperature \ninvestigation at different load resistances and temperature \ndistribution were carried out. Thus, the electrical properties \nand temperature of step-dow n piezoelectric transformers \n†   Corresponding Author: Battery and Piezoelectric Research Center, \nKERI, Changwon, Korea.

Simulation and Experiment \n \nThe schematic diagram of a multilayer piezoelectric \ntransformer with a hole at the center for improved thermal \ndistribution is presented in Fig. 1. In this structure, an input \npart has one layer, while an output part includes three \nlayers; as a result, a low output voltage is obtained. These \nparts are symmetric and divided by a 1.5 mm-width \nisolation gap. Poling direction along with the thickness \ndirection is indicated by arro ws. Electrodes of the output \npart are connected by two symmetric corners to make an \nadvanced electrode pattern. When exciting a voltage to the \ninput part, the radial vibration is generated and transferred \nto the output part by the conv erse piezoelectric effect. The \nmechanical energy is then co nverted into electrical energy \nby the direct piezoelectric ef fect. In this diagram, the \ntransformer model was created by GiD software, which \nwas associated with ATILA for the calculation process. \nFrom the four-sided areas, volumes were extruded and \nmanaged with a layer function necessary to the next steps. \nConditions in simulating the transformer consisted of \npiezoelectric ceramic with meas ured parameters, electrical \npotential (input voltage, ground, and load resistance), and \npolarization direction. Apart from such conditions, the \nthermal analysis required th ermal coefficients of the \nmaterial and convection factors of areas surrounding the \npiezoelectric transformer. The electrical boundary \ncondition and poling direction are presented in Fig. 2. After \nmeshing the model systemically in 168 hexahedral \nelements and 1082 nodes, a modal analysis was used to \nfind the resonance area. Harmonic analysis was then \nselected to investigate the transformer characteristics in \nthis frequency area. The calculation process was carried \nout by ATILA software with the data transferred from GiD \npre-processing, and then the results performed in GiD post-\nprocessing. Output voltage, temperature, admittance, and \nimpedance characteristics were displayed, and output \npower and temperature rise were calculated. From the \nsimulation of difference in hole diameter and thickness, the \noutput power and temperature rise were evaluated to \nchoose an appropriate transformer size. \nA piezoelectric transformer similar to the simulation with \na 28 x 28 x 1.8 mm size and a 2 mm hole diameter was \nfabricated using a hard piezoelectric ceramic because of high \nelectromechanical factor and low energy loss. Commercial-\ngrade raw powders (Junsei Chemical Co., Ltd) of PbO \n(99%), ZrO\n2 (99%), TiO2 (98%), NiO (99%), Nb2O5 (99.5%), \nand MnO2 (99%) were used as raw materials to prepare the \nceramics, with the composition of 0.01Pb(Ni 1/3Nb2/3)O3-\n0.08Pb(Mn1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.91Pb(Zr0.505Ti0.495)O3 (abbreviated as \nPNN-PMN-PZT). Excess powders of 0.3wt% PbO and \n0.3wt% Nb 2O5 were added to the stoichiometric \ncomposition. The excess Nb 2O5 in PZT ceramic improves \nelectromechanical coupling coef ficient and dielectric loss \nbecause of its extrinsic contribution for internal mechanical \nfriction [18]. The ceramic powder was mixed with solvent \nand 1 wt% dispersant by ball-mill method for 24 h, and \nthen 8 wt% polyvinyl butyral and 4 wt% dibutyl phthalate \nwere added to make slurry for a tap-casting process. An 80 \nmm-thick green tape was made using a casting machine \nwith a doctor blade and then dried prior to cutting in sheets \nand punching four corners to fix the position for the next \nsteps. Internal electrodes were printed using Ag/Pd paste. \nThe sheets were stacked under suitable pressure and \ntemperature to obtain cohesion and desired thickness. The \n \n(a) \n \n \n(b) \nFig. 1.

The samples were ground at all sides, \npolished to make a connecting corner, and printed with \nexternal electrodes. Wires were soldered to electrodes \nbefore poling piezoelectric transformers in a silicon oil \nbath at 120 \noC under a 3 kV/mm DC voltage. \nFig. 3 shows a diagram measuring the electrical \nproperties of the piezoelectric transformer that consists of a \nfunction generator, a power amplifier, and an oscilloscope. \nTemperature was determined using an infrared camera after \nan operating period of 20 min. An HP4294A impedance \nanalyzer was used to inve stigate the piezoelectric \nproperties of the piezoelectric transformer. \n \n \n3. Results and Discussion \n \nBased on the successful simulation of multilayer \npiezoelectric transformer on GiD-ATILA software, the \nthickness and hole diameter changed while the surrounding \nsize remained at 28 x 28 mm. Characteristics, including \noutput voltage and temperature as a function of different \nhole diameters and thicknesses as shown in Fig. 4, were \nevaluated to select a suitabl e dimension. Temperature and \noutput voltage increased with a decrease in thickness, but \ndecreased with an increase in hole diameter. With the \ndesired output voltage, normal temperature, and suitable \nfabrication, the piezoelectric transformer with 0.6 mm \nthickness and 2 mm hole diameter was chosen. Afterward, \nthe transformer characteristics were simulated and \ninvestigated specifically. From Fig. 5(a), in the frequency \nrange of 60–90 kHz of output impedance curve, the \nresonance frequency area of the multilayer piezoelectric \ntransformer was around 70 kHz, and the minimum \nimpedance was 2.11 Ω at the resonance frequency of 67.9 \nkHz. In the experimental impedance curve, this impedance \nwas 3.61 Ω at the resonance frequency of 70.2 kHz, as \nshown in Fig. 5(b). From the impedance analysis, the \nmatching impedance was 100 Ω. \n \n \nFig. 3. Schematic of the setup for measuring electric \ncharacteristic \n \nFig. 4. Output voltage and temperature rise as a function of \nhole diameter and thickness: (a) different hole \ndiameters; (b) different thicknesses. \n \n \nFig. 5. Impedance curves of the multilayer piezoelectric \ntransformer: (a) in the simulation; (b) in the \nexperiment. \n \nFig. 6 shows output voltage as a function of frequency at \ndifferent load resistances under a constant input voltage of \n100 V in the ATILA simulation and experiment. The \nModeling and Investigation of Multilayer Piezoelectric Transformer with a Central Hole for Heat Dissipation  \n \n674 \ndriving frequencies describing the maximum output \nvoltage were near resonance frequency as mentioned above \nand increased with the increasing of the load resistance. \nOutput voltage rose gradually when the load resistance \nwent up because of the faster  molecular alternation in the \ntransformer. Maximum output voltages of the multilayer \ntransformer at the driving frequency of 69–72 kHz in the \nsimulation were 33.57, 48.33, 65.26, and 82.54 V at the \nload resistances of 50, 100, 150, and 200 Ω, respectively. \nThese values in the experiment were 27.8, 32.4, 41.8, and \n51.4 V , respectively. Reasons for the difference of output \nvoltages could be the central defection of the hole and the \nsoldering position of the electr ic wire associated with the \ninput section in the fabrication. In addition, electrode \ndimensions, electrode material , external connection of the \nelectrodes, and real degree of texture due to poling were \nnot considered; load resistan ce was also of concern as a \ndistributed parameter depending on the total number of \nelements in the modeling [17,  19–20]. The difference of \nresonance frequencies between the simulated and \nexperimental results was 5%, but this error was very small \ntherefore, a forced cooling method at the center of \ntransformer is more effective. This result is shown in Fig. 7. \nTemperature rise as a function of input voltage and load \nresistance is presented in Fig.  8 after operating for 20 min. \nAt low input voltage, the temperature changed slowly and \ndifferences between load resistances were small. From 80 \nV input voltage, the temperature increased more quickly, \nespecially at 200 Ω due to high distinction compared to the \nmatching load of 100 Ω. As shown in Fig. 9(a), in the \nsimulation, the piezoelectric tran sformer with a hole at the \ncenter was more effective in reducing the temperature \nunder the 115 V input voltage than the piezoelectric \ntransformer without a hole. Furthermore, temperature \ndistributions of fabricated transformers were captured \nusing an infrared camera at such conditions in Fig. 9(b). \nThe highest temperature of transformers with a hole was \n41.4 \noC, while this value was 51.9 oC at the non-hole \n \n \nFig. 6.

The non-electrode surface and \nthe increase of the hole area in the transformer improved \nthe heat-transferring ability. This captured temperature \ndistribution was different from the 3D simulation results \nbecause of the emissivity  between electrodes and \npiezoelectric material in the practical experiment. With a \nlarge electrode area, the thermal emission ability of the \nprinted electrode material needs to be improved to obtain \nbetter temperature distribution. \n \n \n \nFig. 9. Comparison of temperature distribution: (a) in the \nsimulation; (b) in the experiment. \n \n \n \nFig. 10. Output power as a function of input voltage and \nload resistance \n \n \nThe output powers as a function of input voltage and \nload resistance of the multi layer piezoelectric transformer \nare described in Fig. 10. When the input voltage increased, \noutput power increased sharply due to a quadratic \ndependence of output voltage. Input voltage was only \ndetermined up to 115 V because the temperature rise \nsoared from this point in our measurement of piezoelectric \ntransformers. The output power of 16 W was achieved \nstably at the load resistance of 100 Ω because the \ntemperature rise was about 20 \noC in the previous \ntemperature analysis and the efficiency was 96%. \n4. Conclusion \n \nHeat dissipation was improved in the square-shaped \nthree-layer piezoelectric transf ormer with a central hole \nand a 28 × 28 × 1.8 mm size in both the modeling using \nFEM method and the fabrication. Based on this structure, \nthe aspects affecting the oper ation of the piezoelectric \ntransformer were investigated. The piezoelectric trans- \nformer was operated at the resonance frequency of the first \nradial vibration mode. In contrast to the conventional \nmultilayer piezoelectric transformer without a hole, \ntemperature reduction was obtained in the piezoelectric \ntransformer with a hole at th e center. Thus, output power \nwas 16 W at a stable operating condition at 115 V input \nvoltage and 100 Ω load resistance, and this piezoelectric \ntransformer could be used in  AC/DC converters to light \nLED systems. Improve the method for making the central \nhole and simulating more appropriate electrodes, as well as \nthe degree of texture accordi ng to practical piezoelectric \ntransformers, are the future directions of this study. \n \n \nReferences \n \n[ 1 ]   V .
