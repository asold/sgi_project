  "abstract": "AI language models are increasingly transforming language research in various ways. How can language educators and researchers respond to the challenge posed by these AI models? Specifically, how can we embrace this technology to inform and enhance second language learning and teaching? In order to quantitatively characterize and index second language writing, the current work proposes the use of similarities derived from contextualized meaning representations in AI language models. The computational analysis in this work is hypothesis-driven. The current work predicts how similarities should be distributed in a second language learning setting. The results suggest that similarity metrics are informative of writing proficiency assessment and interlanguage development. Statistically significant effects were found across multiple AI models. Most of the metrics could distinguish language learners’ proficiency levels. Significant correlations were also found between similarity metrics and learners’ writing test scores provided by human experts in the domain. However, not all such effects were strong or interpretable. Several results could not be consistently explained under the proposed second language learning hypotheses. Overall, the current investigation indicates that with careful configuration and systematic metrics design, AI language models can be promising tools in advancing language education.",
