INTRODUCTION \n \nA Power transformer is considered as most significant and \nvital element in the power delivery system. Due to the highly \ncompetitive electrical energy market it is required to enhance \nthe system’s reliability and availability with cost effectiveness. \nTo maintain system reliability , its key components such as \npower transformers are required to undergo periodic \ndiagnostics to avoid catastrophe and losses due to downtime \n[1]. The majority of the transfor mer fleet is serving close to or \nbeyond its expected design life as majority of the transformers \nwere installed soon after the World War II and in early 70’s.  \n \n  \nDue to increase in the peak  load demand the hotspot \ntemperature is rising high. The higher hotspot temperature \nforces sufficient reduction in asset’s life and reliability. Due to \nelevated chances of sudden failure, long term revenue loss and \nhigh replacement cost is likely to happen. Therefore in the \nabsence of transformer assessment, utilities may have \nsignificant concerns regarding reliability and performance of \nthe system. Irrespective of the failu re rate, transformers are of \nhigh importance from the point of view of asset management. \nSystem abnormalities such as loading, switching, ambient \ncondition and poor maintenance normally contribute to \naccelerated aging. In the ab sence of critical components \nmonitoring/diagnostics, the failure risk always remain high.  \nInsulation diagnostics is important to ascertain the overall \nintegrity of the transformer to avoid any unscheduled outage, \nconsequently restricting the financial/revenue losses along \nwith environmental and collateral damages. It is always \ndesired to anticipate the faults prior to become active in \nnature. With the application of online monitoring systems and \ndiagnostics, accurate interpretations and timely decision \nincipient faults and accelerated deterioration of the insulation \nsystem can be better judged. Due to differences in operational \ncriteria and climatic influence different characteristics and \nvariety of problems subject to insulation deterioration and \nfailure are observed in transformers.  \nThe uv-spectrophotometry provides characteristics related \nto the contamination level in oil mainly due to the paper \ninsulation (cellulose) which produces Furans, Acids, Water, \nSludge and other compounds on its deterioration. Oil \noxidation occurs due to the presence of oxygen and heat and \nmay cause sludge formation.  Aging is also strongly \ndependent on temperature, oxygen and water levels in the \ntransformer. The transforme r life can be maximized by \ncontrolling these variables. Metal particles are also found in \nthe oil. Power transformer dielectric integrity highly depends \nupon the contamination level. Water and Furan are produced \nsimultaneously and are the key indicators for the life \nexpectancy of the power transf ormer. Continuing presence of \n0.5% moisture in paper and 20 ppm in oil are considered \neffective to cause sufficient dielectric degradation [2]. \n  \n \n \nM .

The \ncellulose can be analyzed with  the measure of the degree of \npolymerization (DP). The DP value below 300 is considered \nalmost with no dielectric and mechanical properties and the \ntransformer is not recommended for service where as the DP \nvalue above 1000 is considered with high dielectric and \ntensile properties [3].  \nTransformer failure statistics exhibit that most of the \nfailures have occurred before reaching their rated life. \nTransformer failures due to dielectric problems are reported as \nhigh as 75% [4].  \nDue to the increase in the av erage age of the transformer \npopulation there is significant c oncern regarding the condition \nof its insulation system [5].  The average age of power \ntransformer in Australia and New Zealand in 1995 was 28.6 \nyears with considerable number (65%)  of transformers over \n30 years [6][7] old. Transformers are considered of strategic \nimportance in the network. The most frequent and immediate \ncause of the transformer costly and long-term outage is due to \nthe winding insulation, on-load tap changer and bushings \ndeterioration [8].  \nIn the absence of insulation diagnostics, a good number of \ntransformers failed before r eaching their desi gned technical \nlife. Average age th at transformers have failed due to \ninsulation deterioration during the last ten years was 17.8 \nyears [9][10]. Therefore im plementation of effective \ndiagnostic tools and monitoring systems stands vital for early \nwarning and assessment to avoid forced outage and \ncatastrophic failure. This will a llow for controlling the aging \nrate by suggesting new operati onal (loading) conditions and \nimplementing the condition based maintenance strategies, \nextension in transformer life is achieved.  \n \nII. UV SPECTROPHOTOMETRY \n \nUV-Spectrophotometry is an accurate and sensitive method \nto analyze impurities in transformer oil by using light \nabsorbing properties of the sample.  The light transmitted \nthrough oil sample containing (various contaminations) is \ndecreased by that fraction be ing absorbed, detected and \nmeasured as a function of wavelength.  A spectrophotometer \nmeasures the transmission, absorption or reflection of the light \nspectrum for the given wavelength.   \nThe Beer's law provides a linear relationship between \nabsorbance and concentrati on of an absorber of \nelectromagnetic radiation such as:  \n \ncbaA ××= λ                 ( 1 )  \n \nWhere A  is the measured absorbance, λ  is a wavelength-\ndependent on absorption coefficient, b  is the path length, and \nc is the sample concentration, also:  \n \ncbA ××= λε                 ( 2 )  \n \nWhere λε  is the wavelength dependent on the molar \nabsorption. The λ subscript is often dropped with the \nunderstanding that a value for ε is for a specific wavelength. \nIf multiple species that absorb light at a given wavelength are \npresent in a sample, the total absorbance at that wavelength is \nthe sum due to all substances:  \n \n( ) ( ) ⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅+××+××= 2211 cbcbA εε    (3) \n \nThe subscripts refer to the molar absorption and \nconcentration of different absorbing impurities present in the \nsample. Experimental measurements are made in terms of \ntransmittanceT which is defined as:  \n \noP\nPT =                    ( 4 )  \n \nWhere P is the power of light after it passes through the \nsample and oP is the initial power of the light. The relation \nbetween A and T is defined as:  \n \n() ⎟⎟\n⎠\n⎞\n⎜⎜\n⎝\n⎛−=−=\noP\nPlogTlogA           ( 5 )  \n \nUV-Spectrophotometry is the non-intrusive test to \ndetermine the transformer integrity. The interpretation allows \noptimal maintenance procedure to achieve maximum \npracticable efficiency with enhanced reliability. The uv-\nspectrophotometry provides reasonable information on the \nhealth of the power transforme r to plan the cost effective \nmaintenance, retirement, relocation and operational criteria. \nThe spectrophotometry provides the over all assessment of the \ntransformer with precision and the correlation between the \ntransformer aging and uv trend can be easily established. \n \nIII. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS \nA. Reflection Tests \nReflection is the return of the radiation by a medium without \na change in the wavelength.  The reflection may be specular or \ndiffuse in nature depending upon the angle of incidence with \nrespect to angle of reflection. The glossier the surface, more \nspecular is the reflection. Reflection is expressed in \npercentage ( )λR%  relative to the reflection from the \nstandard substance such as: \n \n100% ×−\n−=\nλγ\nλγ\nλ\nDR\nDSR             ( 6 )  \n612\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: CURTIN UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY.

The reflection \nexhibits its characteristics in the wavelength range of 300 to \n900 nm. Above 80% reflection in fresh oil appears in the \nwavelength rang of 375 to 800 nm. \n \n \nFigure 1: New Oil Reflection UV-Spectrophotometry Characteristics. \nFive transformers rated at 10, 15, 15, 10, & 10 MVA \nrespectively were selected to perform the oil uv-\nspectrophotometry tests as no oil was neither replaced or \ntreated (regeneration) for any of these unit in their life time. \nThe transformers were retired not due to specific problem but \nconsidered being very old. The service age was found to be \n25, 24 22, 22 and 19 years respectively without any \nabnormality during life time. Al so transformer oil sampled \nfrom a scrapped (burnt) 100 MVA transformer was obtained \nfor reference. It is unwise to judge a transformer only on its \nservice age with no diagnostics.  The insulation may still be \nworth to withstand electrical a nd mechanical stresses and the \nasset may continue to serve for further period of time. \nThe uv-spectrophotometry for reflection exhibits a clear \nvariation in the characteristic s of various ages of the \ntransformer oil as shown in Figure 2. In the wavelength \nspectrum from 300 to 900 nm the aging profile is prominent \nwhere as the scrapped transformer oil provide almost no \nreflection criteria in this range as shown in Figure 3. The \ndeviation of the signature of aged oil form the new oil is \nsignificant in terms of wavelength spectrum and maximum \npercentage reflection as shown in Figure 2. The maximum \nreflection decreases with age as well as there is a shift in the \nwavelength for the maximum to occur.  \nThe uv-spectrophotometry reflection characteristics of \nscrapped oil from completely burnt transformer appear only in \nthe range of 177.5 to 189 nm wavelength spectrum. The +25% \n-60% reflection does not show any consistency in comparison \nto the above test characteristics as  shown in Figure 3. The oil \ncontains high carbon and water content including other \ncontaminations. \n \n \nFigure 2: Different Age Transformer Oil Reflection UV Spectrum. \n \n \nFigure 3: Scrap Transformer (burnt) Oil Reflection UV Characterisitcs \nB. Absorbance Tests \nThe absorbance spectrum provide s a measure of how much \nlight is absorbed by the oil sample. The application is sensitive \nfor the chemical concentrations in liquids and gaseous \nsamples. The absorbance λA is calculated as: \n \n⎟⎟\n⎠\n⎞\n⎜⎜\n⎝\n⎛\n−\n−−=\nλλ\nλλ\nλ\nDR\nDSA 10log             ( 7 )  \n \n Where S  is the sample intensity at wavelength λ , D is the \ndark intensity at wavelength λ , R  is the reference intensity at \nwavelength λ . \nIn confirmation to the reflection results the oil samples from \nthe same units were test ed for the absorbance uv-\nspectrophotometry. The new transformer oil absorbance \nexhibits its characteristics between 175 and 350 nm \n613\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: CURTIN UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY.

Restrictions apply. \n \nwavelength uv-spectrum, with maximum absorbance at 250 \nnm wavelength as shown in Figure 4. \n \n \nFigure 4: New Oil Absorbance UV Characteristics \nThe uv-spectrophotometry (absorbance) for the 10, 15, 15, \n10, & 10 MVA transformers exhibits the respective \ncharacteristics in the range of 175-700 nm wavelength uv-\nspectrum as demonstrated in Figure 5. The spectrographs \nrepresent that the absorban ce increases with the oil \ndeterioration and contaminations due to the aging properties \nof the insulation system (oil + cellulose). Also the bandwidth \nfor the maximum absorbance increases and there is a \nwavelength shift as well with the age.  \n \n \nFigure 5: Different Age Transformer Oil Absorbance UV Spectrum \nThe absorbance spectrograph fo r the scrapped oil exhibits \nhigh absorbance level over the uv-spectrum from 200-900 nm \nwavelength as shown in Figure 6. Also there is a considerable \nnoise from 200 to 540 nm range, mainly due to the variety of \ncontamination including very high carbon and water contents. \nThe results demonstrated above points to the fact that \nstrong correlation exists between the reflection/absorption \nindices and the level of contaminations present in the oil. Oil \ncondition could be interpreted from scrapped to excellent. \n \n \nFigure 6: Scrap Transformer (burnt) Oil Absorbance UV Characterisitcs \n \nIV. CONCLUSION \n \nUV-Spectrophotometry technique is proposed in this paper \nfor detection of the level of contamination for oil \nregeneration/ replacement.  The technique may prove to be an \nalternative to oil conductivity assessment. It also dictates the \ninsulation system (oil + cellulose) condition due to normal as \nwell as accelerated deterioration/ aging. Surprised failures and \nforced outages can be minimized effectively. A good return on \nthe capital investment can be achieved as well as an extension \nin life is possible leading to proper asset management. \n \nREFERENCES \n \n[1] T. Strehl, E. Lemke, H.
