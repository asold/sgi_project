    "abstract": "Several Smart Transformer (ST) architectures have been discussed in literature and the modular approach proved to be interesting because of its advantage of fault tolerance associated to the possibility to use low voltage/current rated devices. In this context, this paper presents an overview and classification of the modular ST architectures, in which the topologies, connections and building block converters are discussed. Furthermore, a ST architectures named “interphase ST architecture” is proposed and described in detail. The main characteristic is that the phases of the three-phase system are connected to the same building block converter, in such way that a single module controls the power exchange among the phases. Therefore, this solution offers higher power control capability. Finally, simulation results are provided and the power transfer capability among the phases of the three phase system is demonstrated.",
