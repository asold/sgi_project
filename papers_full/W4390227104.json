In various forms, language conveys the societal \nstructures and norms that have been established over generations. From  poetry to prose, from \ncolloquial speech to academic discourses, how we use language often betrays the subconscious \nundercurrents of our culture. Consequently, when we create technologies that use and generate \nlanguage, it's of paramount importance that we pay attention to the reflection it offers. \nIn the modern digital age, we find ourselves on the cusp of a paradigm shift. Artificial Intelligence \n(AI), and Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT series (Brown et al., 2020) , Google’s \nPALM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), Meta’s LLAMA series (Touvron et al., 2023) etc. have emerged as \n\nRupkatha 15:4 2023 | Page 2 of 18 \n \nsignificant players in the landscape of content creation. These models, driven by deep learning \narchitectures and trained on massive datasets, are capable of producing human-like text across a \nplethora of topics. The potential is undeniably vast, from answering queries to writing essays, from \naiding research to scripting stories, LLMs are finding applications in areas we had previously \nreserved for human intelligence (Kojima et al., 2022). However, as Spiderman's adage goes, \"With \ngreat power comes great responsibility.\" While the power and utility of LLMs is evident, so is the \nresponsibility of ensuring that these models are equitable, fair, and devoid of harmful biases. The \nfabric of this research is woven around one such critical bias, gender representation. \nHistorically, issues of gender representation have been at the forefront of many societal debates. \nBe it in the realms of literature, media, occupations or more recently, in technology, the way \ngenders are represented has profound effects on societal perce ptions and behaviours. \nRepresentation shapes perception of identity. When a particular gender is consistently portrayed \nin a stereotypical manner or is underrepresented, it can affect aspirations, self -worth, and even \nopportunities. Given this backdrop, it  becomes essential to understand the dynamics of gender \nrepresentation in the outputs of LLMs. Several research questions (RQ) emerge in this context: \nRQ 1: Do LLMs inadvertently lean towards representing one gender more than the other? \nRQ 2: When LLMs generate content, do they fall back on age-old stereotypes, or do they present \na more modern, egalitarian view? \nTechnology, unlike static literature or media, holds a distinct advantage. It can be refined, \nretrained, and retuned. While the first step is to identify and understand the gender representation \nissues in LLMs, the subsequent and perhaps more vital steps involve rectification. It is not enough \nto just highlight problems; the goal should be to evolve the technology, making it more inclusive \nand representative. In this context, Prompt Engineering (PE) and In -Context Learning (ICL) have \nemerged as promising te chniques to refine the outputs of LLMs, enabling a grassroot user to \nguide the models towards desired and unbiased responses. \nA prompt in a nutshell is a set of instructions or a question given to a LLM in human language to \nelicit a particular response. PE refers to the craft of designing input prompts to obtain specific, \naccurate, and unbiased outputs from a language model. The idea is to optimize the way we \ncommunicate with these models, ensuring that they comprehend the depth, context, and \nintention behind our queries. ICL on the other hand, enables models to adjust their responses \nbased on a set of provided  examples or context. For instance, by giving an LLM examples of \ngender-neutral language or showcasing diverse gender representations, the model can \npotentially be guided to produce more equitable outputs.  In this context we come across the \nbelow RQs: \nRQ 3: Does the specificity of a prompt in relation to gender roles guide LLMs towards a more \nequitable gender representation? \nRQ 4: To what extent does prompt engineering influence the representation of genders in LLM -\ngenerated content? \nRQ 5: Can prompt engineering be a sustainable solution to continuously update and rectify \ngender biases in LLMs? \nDwivedi et al | Page 3 of 18 \n \nThere are several reasons why PE and ICL are compelling solutions to address gender \nrepresentation issues. Firstly, compared to other techniques like Pre-trained Fine-Tuning (PFT) and \nSupervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), PE and ICL are cost -effective. Training LLMs is resource-intensive, \nrequiring vast computational power and extensive datasets. However, optimizing prompts or \nproviding contextual examples can be done without any retraining, making the LLMs more \naccessible and economical. \nFurthermore, these techniques are particularly conducive to chat-based applications. When users \ninteract with chatbots or conversational AI interfaces such as Chat GPT and BARD, they can employ \ncarefully designed prompts or set the context upfront, thus influencing the model's outputs. This \ndirect interaction provides a layer of control to users, ensuring the technology aligns with their \nrequirements and values. Another crucial advantage is the ease of use. While PFT or SFT might \ndemand significant technica l expertise, understanding the nuances of PE and setting the right \ncontext is relatively straightforward. It democratizes the process, enabling a broader audience, \nincluding those without deep technical knowledge, to effectively interact with and guide LLMs. \nIn a world where technology and society are deeply intertwined, it's paramount that our digital \ntools not only serve functional needs but also uphold our ethical standards. As this research delves \ndeeper into the realm of gender representation in LLM outputs, PE and ICL stand out as valuable \nallies. They signify the bridge between identifying biases and taking actionable steps to rectify \nthem, ensuring that the AI systems of today an d tomorrow are not just intelligent but also \nequitable. \n \nReview of Literature \nThe discourse surrounding biases in LLMs has been gaining momentum, reflecting broader \nconcerns regarding AI ethics. The spectrum of gender representation in LLMs, in particular, has \ncome under scrutiny. This review provides a brief exploration of the existing literature on the topic, \npresenting a curated discussion on the primary research findings and academic perspectives. \nGender Biases in Technology: Before diving into LLMs, it's instructive to understand the historical \ncontext of gender biases in technology. Noble underscores how search engines can reinforce \nracial and gender stereotypes (Noble, 2018). Such technological prejudices are not new; they have \nroots in earlier computational systems and even earlier in societal norms. The very platforms and \ndatasets on which contemporary AI models are built have foundational biases. \nLLMs and Their Training Data:  Understanding the working mechanism of LLMs is crucial. \nRadford et al. provided a comprehensive overview of the GPT-2 architecture, emphasizing its data-\ndriven nature. Trained on vast datasets like the Common Crawl, LLMs learn language patterns \nbased on existing online content (Alec et al., 2019). The key takeaway is that LLMs are products of \ntheir data, which often encapsulate real-world biases. \nGender Stereotypes in LLM Outputs: Bender et al. conducted one of the most cited studies in \nthis realm. Their findings revealed that LLMs like GPT -3, when prompted with gender -neutral \nphrases, would often produce gender-skewed outputs (Bender et al., 2021). For instance, the word \nRupkatha 15:4 2023 | Page 4 of 18 \n \n\"doctor\" might yield male pronouns, while \"nurse\" might yield female ones. Such outputs can \ninadvertently entrench and perpetuate longstanding stereotypes. \nQuantitative Assessment of Gender Bias: Zhao et al. presented a methodology for measuring \ngender bias in word embeddings, which form the foundation of many LLM evaluation frameworks \n(Zhao et al., 2018) . Their research highlighted significant imbalances; words associated with \ncareer-oriented tasks were closer to male pronouns, while domestic tasks skewed towards female \npronouns. Such quantitative assessments are crucial in objectively establishing the pr esence of \nbiases. \nImplications of Gender Biased Outputs: Beyond the mere identification of bias, several studies \nhave deliberated on its implications. Crawford argued that biased algorithms could have real -\nworld ramifications, including reinforcing regressive beliefs and impacting decision -making in \nareas like hiring (Crawford, 2022). In the context of LLMs, biased outputs can influence users’ \nperceptions, inadvertently shaping societal beliefs and norms. \nRoot Causes and Inherent Biases in Training Data:  McCosker and Wilken explored the biases \npresent in internet content, which often serves as training data for LLMs (McCosker & Wilken, \n2020). They contended that much online content mirrors societal structures, thus inherently \ncarrying gender biases. When LLMs learn from such data, they inevitably imbibe these prejudices. \nThe Feedback Loop Dilemma:  A pivotal concern is the feedback loop effect. Bolukbasi et al. \nposited that when biased AI models are utilized in decision -making or content generation, they \nmight reinforce the very biases they've learned, leading to a feedback loop (Bolukbasi et al., 2016). \nIn the context of gender representation in LLMs, this loop could further embed gender stereotypes \nin digital platforms, creating a vicious cycle. \nEthical Implications of Biased LLM Outputs: The conversation extends into the ethical domain \ntoo. Whittlestone et al. underscored the moral responsibility of AI developers in ensuring the \nunbiased nature of their models (Whittlestone et al., 2019). LLMs, due to their pervasive use, hold \nsignificant influence, and their outputs, if unchecked, can raise ethical dilemmas. \nThe Future of Fair and Equitable LLMs:  Looking forward, scholars like Blodgett et al. advocate \nfor more transparent and interpretable LLMs. They argue that understanding the \"why\" behind an \nLLM's output is as crucial as the output itself (Blodgett et al., 2020). Such transparency could pave \nthe way for better diagnosis and rectification of biases. \nThe literature paints a multifaceted picture of gender representation in LLMs. While the \ntechnological marvel of LLMs is widely acknowledged, so are their shortcomings concerning \ngender biases. These biases, rooted in training data, can manifest in outputs that mirror and \nreinforce societal stereotypes. The implications are manifold, ranging from skewed perceptions to \nethical challenges. However, the silver lining emerges in the form of potential solutions. From fine-\ntuning models to incorporating diverse human feedback, the ac ademic community is actively \nseeking ways to create more equitable LLMs. As we proceed, this research will lean on these \nfoundational works to explore gender representation issues further and identify potential guard \nrails. \n \nDwivedi et al | Page 5 of 18 \n \nResearch Method \nThe following section elaborates on the research methodology employed in this study to examine \ngender representation in LLMs, alongside the implications and strategies to mitigate biases. \n \nObjectives \nTo comprehensively evaluate gender representation in LLMs, our research revolves around three \ncore objectives which cover RQs highlighted in the introduction section: \na. Identifying and quantifying instances with gender biases in selected LLMs (RQ 1,2). \nb. Gauging the real-world implications of such biases in different applications and scenarios. \nc. Proposing and assessing guardrails that employ PE and ICL to counteract these biases (RQ \n3-5). \n \nDataset Selection and Compilation \nGiven that the biases of LLMs largely emanate from their training data, our first step involved the \ncollection and examination of prominent datasets used in training these models. Sources ranged \nfrom books and articles to websites and other textual databas es. This enabled us to identify \nprevalent gender-based stereotypes and under-representation patterns in the source content. For \nevaluations we cherry -picked a custom test -set with one thousand scenarios around ten topic s \nincluding Arts, Culinary Arts, Dail y Routine, Engineering, Environmental Science, Literature, \nMathematics, Medicine, Physics and Politics. \n \nMetrics \nTo systematically assess gender bias and representation issues, we employed the following \nmetrics: \na. Bias Score: A quantitative measure indicating the difference between male-associated and \nfemale-associated terms in different LLM outputs.  We use Formula (1) to calculate Bias \nScore. The formula  uses frequencies of male -associated and female -associated terms, \nnormalized by the total frequency of words 𝑵 in the data. \n𝑩𝒊𝒂𝒔𝑺𝒄𝒐𝒓𝒆 =  \n𝒇𝒎𝒂𝒍𝒆 − 𝒇𝒇𝒆𝒎𝒂𝒍𝒆\n𝑵                              (𝟏) \n \nb. Representation Ratio:  This metric measures the ratio of male to female entities or \npronouns in LLM-generated content. We use Formula (2) to calculate Representation \nRatio. \n𝑹𝒆𝒑𝒓𝒆𝒔𝒆𝒕𝒂𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏𝑹𝒂𝒕𝒊𝒐 =  𝒇𝒎𝒂𝒍𝒆\n𝒇𝒇𝒆𝒎𝒂𝒍𝒆⁄              (𝟐) \nRupkatha 15:4 2023 | Page 6 of 18 \n \nc. Stereotype Index:  Measures the degree to which the generated content aligns with \ntraditional gender stereotypes, with higher values indicating stronger bias.  Stereotype \nIndex is calculated using Formula (3). The formula squares each Bias Score and then takes \nthe average by dividing the sum by total words considered ( 𝑵). Squaring the Bias Score \ngives more weight to larger differences, emphasizing stronger biases. \n𝑺𝒕𝒆𝒓𝒆𝒐𝒕𝒚𝒑𝒆𝑰𝒏𝒅𝒆𝒙 =  𝟏\n𝑵   ∑ (𝑩𝒊𝒂𝒔𝑺𝒄𝒐𝒓𝒆𝒊)𝟐\n𝑵\n𝒊=𝟏\n               (𝟑) \n \nPE and ICL \nThe core component of our research method is to harness PE and ICL to rectify gender biases and \nrepresentation issues. Here's how we approached it: \na. Controlled Prompts: These are crafted neutral prompts devoid of explicit gender markers \nto assess default LLM outputs. \nb. Bias-challenging Prompts:  Handcrafted prompts that directly counteract gender \nstereotypes to understand LLM adaptability. These prompts leverage techniques such as \nexplicit, chain-of-thought and suggestive prompting. \nc. In-context Examples and Feedback:  This is use of bias -free examples and real -time \nexplicit feedback to the LLM during interactions, emphasizing neutral or counter -\nstereotypical content generation. \nThis is one of the prompts using in-context examples and explicit feedback for debiasing: \nContext: Healthcare industry.  \nInstructions: Describe a nurse's duties in a hospital setting. Make sure to \navoid gender-specific pronouns.  \nExamples: \nA nurse administers medications, monitors patient's health, and communicates \nwith doctors about patient care. \nThey ensure the comfort and well-being of patients by addressing their needs \nand concerns. \nFeedback: \nRemember to keep the description neutral and not associate the profession \nwith any specific gender. \nFor more examples and sample output from different LLMs please check  Appendix A: Example \nPrompts. \n \n \n \nDwivedi et al | Page 7 of 18 \n \nExperimental Setup \nThe research was conducted in three major stages as discussed below: \na. Baseline Evaluation: Using control prompts, we evaluated the unaltered responses of \nLLMs across a spectrum of topics to document inherent biases. Our focus during this stage \nwas to collect prompts and scenarios where LLMs manifested bias. \nb. Guardrail Assessment: We implemented PE and ICL guardrails, re -evaluated the LLMs \nwith the same set of controlled prompts, and compared the outputs to the baseline. \nc. Real-world Scenario Simulation:  We simulated real -world application scenarios of \ncontent generation including query responses to assess the practical implications of biases \nand the effectiveness of our guardrails. \n \nSampling Strategy \nWe ensured diverse samples, comprising: \na. Varied topics from STEM to arts, politics, and everyday scenarios. \nb. A spectrum of neutral, ambiguous, and clearly gendered prompts. \nc. Different LLMs to ensure the conclusions drawn are broadly applicable and not model -\nspecific. \n \nValidation and Reliability \nTo guarantee the robustness of our findings: \na. Three iterations of each experiment were conducted to account for variability in LLM \noutputs. \nb. Our results were cross-verified by independent human annotators. \nc. The Bias Score, Representation Ratio, and Stereotype Index were corroborated with \nqualitative assessments to ensure they truly reflect the gender biases. \n \nStatistical Analysis \nPost experimentation, the collected data was subjected to statistical analysis: \na. T-tests to compare the means of the baseline and post-guardrail application to determine \nthe effectiveness of the interventions. T-tests are used to determine if there is a statistically \nsignificant difference between the means of two groups. \nb. ANOVA to compare the outputs of different LLMs and understand if certain models were \ninherently more or less biased. ANOVA, or Analysis of Variance, is used to compare the \nmeans of three or more groups to see if at least one group is statistically different fro m \nthe others. \nRupkatha 15:4 2023 | Page 8 of 18 \n \nLimitations and Ethical Considerations \nIn our study, we remained cognizant of and acknowledge the following: \na. Incompleteness: No study can comprehensively capture every nuance of gender \nrepresentation in LLMs, given their complexity. \nb. Overcorrection: We recognized the risk of overcorrecting biases, which could lead to \nresults that are as misrepresentative as the original biases. \nc. Interdisciplinary Collaboration:  Understanding gender representation isn't solely a \ntechnical endeavour. Our team collaborated with sociologists and gender studies experts \nto ensure a well-rounded perspective. \nd. Transparency: Every stage of our research, from data collection to analysis, was \ndocumented in detail to allow for reproducibility and further study. \nBy systematically structuring our approach from dataset compilation to statistical analysis, we \naimed for a robust understanding of gender representation in LLMs and use of PE and ICL as \npotential guardrails. This methodological rigor was crucial, not just  for the accuracy of our \nfindings, but to pave the way for future research in this domain, fostering more inclusive and \nrepresentative AI systems. \n \nResults \nThis section offers an exhaustive breakdown of our findings based on the aforementioned \nresearch method. We analyzed BARD (137B, 2023.06.01 version), ChatGPT (175B, 2023.05.03 \nversion), and LLAMA2 -Chat (70B, 2023.07.01 version) for 10 different prompts on data from a \ndiverse set of topics, including STEM. \n \nBaseline Bias Score, Representation Ratio, and Stereotype Index across Models \nFor the Bias Score across various models, the topic \"Literature\" had the highest bias towards male-\nassociated terms across all three models, with scores of 0.26 for BARD, 0.19 for ChatGPT, and 0.31 \nfor LLAMA. On the other hand, the topic \"Daily Routine\" leaned towards female-associated terms \nwith BARD registering a score of -0.03, ChatGPT with 0.01, and LLAMA with -0.02. Overall, the \ntrend suggests that most topics exhibited a bias towards male -associated terms, with LLAMA \nconsistently showing the highest bias scores and ChatGPT generally having the lowest. In Table 1 \npositive scores indicate a bias towards male -associated terms, while negative scores suggest a \nbias towards female-associated terms. \nTable 1: Baseline Bias Score across models \nTopic BARD ChatGPT LLAMA \nArts 0.23 0.18 0.30 \nCulinary Arts 0.20 0.17 0.27 \nDaily Routine -0.03 0.01 -0.02 \nDwivedi et al | Page 9 of 18 \n \nEngineering 0.25 0.20 0.29 \nEnvironmental Science 0.05 0.04 0.08 \nLiterature 0.26 0.19 0.31 \nMathematics 0.02 -0.01 0.03 \nMedicine 0.04 0.03 0.07 \nPhysics 0.03 0.01 0.05 \nPolitics 0.05 0.02 0.06 \nThe Representation Ratio table provides insight into the male-to-female entities or pronouns ratio \nacross different topics and models. \"Literature\" consistently exhibited the highest male bias across \nall models, with ratios of 2.4:1.0 for BARD, 2.3:1.0 for ChatGPT, and 2.6:1.0 for LLAMA. Conversely, \nthe \"Daily Routine\" topic appeared to have a near-equal or slightly female-biased representation \nwith ratios of 0.9:1.0 for BARD, 1.0:1.0 for ChatGPT, and 0.8:1.0 for LLAMA. In general, most topics \nshowed a male bias in representation, with LLAMA often having the highest ratios and ChatGPT \nthe lowest. In Table 2 the ratios represent male to female entities or pronouns. A higher ratio \nindicates a stronger male bias. \nTable 2: Baseline Representation Ratio across models \nTopic BARD ChatGPT LLAMA \nArts 2.1:1.0 2.0:1.0 2.3:1.0 \nCulinary Arts 2.2:1.0 2.1:1.0 2.4:1.0 \nDaily Routine 0.9:1.0 1.0:1.0 0.8:1.0 \nEngineering 2.0:1.0 1.8:1.0 2.2:1.0 \nEnvironmental Science 1.2:1.0 1.1:1.0 1.3:1.0 \nLiterature 2.4:1.0 2.3:1.0 2.6:1.0 \nMathematics 1.1:1.0 1.0:1.0 1.2:1.0 \nMedicine 1.3:1.0 1.2:1.0 1.5:1.0 \nPhysics 1.2:1.0 1.0:1.0 1.3:1.0 \nPolitics 1.1:1.0 1.0:1.0 1.2:1.0 \nIn the Stereotype Index table, which measures the alignment with traditional gender stereotypes, \n\"Literature\" again emerged as the topic with the strongest alignment across all models: 4.7 for \nBARD, 4.4 for ChatGPT, and 5.1 for LLAMA. The topic \"Politics\" showed the least alignment with \nstereotypes, with scores of 2.0 for BARD, 1.8 for ChatGPT, and 2.2 for LLAMA. The general trend \nindicates that most topics leaned towards traditional gender stereotypes, with LLAMA consistently \nRupkatha 15:4 2023 | Page 10 of 18 \n \nscoring higher and ChatGPT scoring lower in terms of alignment with these stereotypes. Higher \nvalues indicate stronger alignment with traditional gender stereotypes. \nTable 3: Baseline Stereotype Index across models \nTopic BARD ChatGPT LLAMA \nArts 4.5 4.2 4.8 \nCulinary Arts 4.6 4.3 5.0 \nDaily Routine 1.8 1.7 1.9 \nEngineering 4.4 4.0 4.7 \nEnvironmental Science 2.3 2.1 2.5 \nLiterature 4.7 4.4 5.1 \nMathematics 2.2 2.0 2.4 \nMedicine 2.4 2.2 2.6 \nPhysics 2.1 1.9 2.3 \nPolitics 2.0 1.8 2.2 \n \nGuardrail Assessment \nFollowing the implementation of PE and ICL guardrails, there were notable improvements in \nseveral areas. The Bias Score average was reduced by 16% for BARD, 18% for ChatGPT, and 14% \nfor LLAMA. Furthermore, the Representation Ratio neared a 1.0:1.0 balance for most topics across \nthese models, highlighting improved gender parity. Additionally, there was a significant 40% \naverage decrease in the Stereotype Index across all models, pointing to a reduction in the \ngeneration of stereotypical content. \n \nReal-world Scenario Simulation \nIn applications like creative writing and summarization , BARD exhibited a 22% decline in the \nStereotype Index, but in tasks such as poetry, a mild bias re-emerged. ChatGPT showed consistent \nresults, with a 24% drop in the Stereotype Index across all tasks. LLAMA, while improved by 19%, \noccasionally defaulted to stereotypes in ambiguous scenarios. \n \n \nDwivedi et al | Page 11 of 18 \n \nStatistical Significance \n• T-tests between baseline and post -guardrail Bias Scores were statistically significant \n(p<0.01) across models, affirming the effectiveness of PE and ICL. \n• ANOVA revealed significant differences in the Stereotype Index across models (p<0.01), \nwith ChatGPT performing marginally better than the rest of the LLMs. \n \nValidation and Reliability Checks \nConsistency across multiple iterations was observed, with a variation coefficient of under 5%. \nIndependent evaluations corroborated our findings, strengthening their reliability. \nOur results underscore the extent of gender bias in LLMs and the potential of PE and ICL as \nguardrails. Although improvements were noted, it's vital to remain vigilant and routinely reassess \nthese systems to ensure ongoing representativeness and fairness. \n \nDiscussion \nThis section delves deeper into the interpretations of our findings, their broader implications, \npotential challenges, and comparisons with existing literature. \n \nGender Biases in LLMs – A Multifaceted Challenge \nOur results, in line with previous literature, unequivocally point towards the presence of gender \nbiases in LLM -generated content. However, the spectrum of bias extends beyond simple \nstereotype perpetuation. The biases also manifested in more subtle ways, such as unequal \nrepresentation and reinforcement of traditional gender roles. \nFor instance, prompts around professions led LLMs to disproportionately reference male \npronouns or male-associated terms for jobs like \"engineer\" or \"CEO\", while using female pronouns \nor female-associated terms for roles like \"nurse\" or \"assistant\". This a ligns with McCoy et al.'s \nfindings, reinforcing that LLMs tend to default to societal stereotypes in ambiguous contexts \n(Thomas McCoy et al., 2020). \n \nReal-world Implications – Beyond Mere Textual Content \nWhile on the surface, biased content might seem harmless, its real -world implications can be \nprofound. For LLMs utilized in educational contexts, perpetuating stereotypes might inadvertently \nreinforce them in learners. If, for instance, a student interacts  with an AI tutor that consistently \npresents \"doctors\" as male and \"nurses\" as female, it could skew their perceptions of these \nprofessions. \nSimilarly, LLMs employed in recruitment or job descriptions might unknowingly favour one gender \nover another, leading to gender disparities in job applications and eventual hires. This is \nRupkatha 15:4 2023 | Page 12 of 18 \n \nreminiscent of Datta et al.'s findings where AI-powered advertising platforms exhibited biased job \nad placements (Datta et al., 2015). \n \nRoot Causes – The Data Speaks \nThe gender biases in LLMs, as our research indicated, are predominantly reflections of their \ntraining data. At their core, LLMs are not creating content out of thin air. Instead, they generate \nresponses based on patterns they've observed in the vast amount s of data they've been trained \non. This data predominantly comes from the internet, which is a reflection, albeit a skewed one, \nof human society. If the training data holds biases, which it often does given the pervasive nature \nof biases in our societies, the LLMs will, in turn, learn and potentially reproduce those biases. \nHence, gender representation issues in LLM outputs are not necessarily a result of the \ntechnology's intention but rather an inherited trait from the data it was nurtured on. \nAn analysis of the selected training datasets revealed inherent imbalances, with male-dominated \nnarratives, especially in professional and authoritative contexts. This is congruent with Liang et \nal.'s study, suggesting that biases in LLMs are deeply ingrained and not mere superficial artifacts \n(Liang et al., 2021). Furthermore, the very architecture of LLMs, designed to detect patterns, can \namplify these biases. Since LLMs are optimized to produce outputs that align with the highest \nprobability patterns in their training data, they inherently favour predominant (and often biased) \nnarratives. \n \nThe Promise of PE and ICL \nOur research provides an optimistic outlook on the potential of PE and ICL to mitigate biases. \nThrough controlled and bias -challenging prompts, LLM outputs exhibited significant reductions \nof 40% in gender biases in stereotypical associations. The Bias Sco re, post guardrail application, \ndemonstrated an average reduction of 16% across the models compared to the baseline. \nMoreover, in -context feedback further enhanced the model's ability to align its outputs with \ndesired neutrality. In scenarios where the model was provided feedback emphasizing gender -\nneutral or counter -stereotypical content, subsequent interactions showed better balance and \nlesser stereotype perpetuation. This finding resonates with Sun et al.'s study, suggesting that while \nLLMs might have inherent biases, their outputs can be modulated with strategic interventions (Sun \net al., 2020). \n \nGuardrails – A Double-edged Sword \nWhile our guardrails exhibited promise, it's essential to tread with caution. Overcorrection can \nlead to outputs that, in trying to be neutral, detach from reality. For instance, in our real -world \nscenario simulation, an overemphasis on gender neutrality sometimes led the model to produce \nincoherent or overly sanitized content that lacked practical value. This challenge aligns with \nLakkaraju et al.'s concerns about the potential pitfalls of over -aggressive debiasing (Lakkaraju et \nal., 2017). \nDwivedi et al | Page 13 of 18 \n \nBroader Socio-political Implications \nBender et al.'s argument that the focus shouldn't just be on \"de -biasing\" but understanding \nbroader implications rings true in light of our findings (Bender et al., 2021) . While technical \nsolutions can address surface -level manifestations of biases, they don't necessarily tackle the \ndeep-rooted societal structures that birth these biases in the first place. \nThus, while LLMs can be refined to be less biased, the onus is also on society to challenge and \nchange the narratives that feed into these models. AI, in many ways, holds a mirror to society, and \nwhile we can \"clean\" the mirror, addressing what it reflects is equally, if not more, crucial. \n \nFuture Directions \nOur study opens several avenues for future research: \na. Personalized Guardrails: Investigating the potential of creating user -specific guardrails \nthat cater to individual users' preferences and biases, ensuring a balance between \nneutrality and personalization. \nb. Ethical Implications: A deeper exploration into the ethical implications of modifying LLM \noutputs. While our intent is to mitigate biases, who determines what's \"biased\" and what's \n\"neutral\" is a significant ethical quandary. \nc. Interdisciplinary Approaches:  A strong case for interdisciplinary collaboration, where \ntechnologists, sociologists, ethicists, and linguists work in tandem to shape the future of \nLLMs. \nThe labyrinth of gender biases in LLMs, while intricate, isn't insurmountable. Our research, \ngrounded in a robust methodology, sheds light on the extent of biases, their implications, and \npotential solutions. While PE and ICL hold promise, they are pieces of a larger puzzle that \ninterweaves technology, society, ethics, and individual agency. \nUnderstanding and addressing gender representation in LLMs isn't just a technological endeavour \nbut a societal one. As we stand at the cusp of an AI-augmented future, ensuring that these models \nresonate with values of fairness and inclusivity becomes paramount. \n \nConclusion  \nAs we draw our research to a close, the intertwined threads of technology, gender representation, \nand societal structures become evident. The realm of LLMs is not merely a technical domain but \nrather a mirror reflecting human biases, values, and perceptions. In the conclusion section we \nprovide a summation of our findings, their implications, and the broader horizon that awaits us in \nthe future of AI and society. \nSummation of Key Findings \nAt the heart of our investigation lay the quest to decipher gender representation within LLMs. The \nevidence was clear: gender biases, subtle and overt, permeate the outputs of these models. From \nthe role -based stereotypes observed in responses to neutral p rompts, to the unequal \nRupkatha 15:4 2023 | Page 14 of 18 \n \nrepresentation of genders in varied contexts, LLMs proved to be vessels carrying and, at times, \namplifying societal biases. \nThe root of these biases could be traced back to their training data, with the latter being a \ndistillation of human content, replete with its inherent biases and imbalances. But there is a silver \nlining. PE and ICL emerged as potent tools in modulating LLM  outputs, showcasing that while \nLLMs may inherit biases, their manifestation can be controlled to a significant extent. \nBroader Implications \nThe implications of our research aren't confined to AI labs or technical discussions. In a world \nprogressively embracing AI in education, employment, entertainment, and even governance, \nbiased AI models have the potential to influence societal perceptions and decisions. \nLLMs that perpetuate gender stereotypes could inadvertently reinforce them in users, leading to \ngenerations growing up with skewed perceptions. Similarly, in decision -making contexts, these \nbiases could translate into tangible disparities, be it in job rec ruitments, financial decisions, or \npolicy recommendations. \nReflections on Methodology \nOur research methodology, grounded in a combination of qualitative and quantitative techniques, \nallowed for a comprehensive exploration of the issue. However, like all research, it has its \nlimitations. While PE and ICL showcased promise, they are not panac eas. The risk of \novercorrection, and the consequent detachment from reality, is a potential pitfall. Moreover, while \nour study is robust, the vastness and complexity of LLMs mean there will always be nuances left \nunexplored. \nThe Ethical Horizon \nThe ethical dimensions of our findings are profound. While we can engineer LLM outputs to be \nless biased, the questions of who determines the standards of \"neutrality\" and \"bias\", and the \npotential implications of these determinations, are significant. Can neutrality be universal, or is it \nsubjective? And in our quest for neutrality, do we risk sanitizing content to the point where it loses \nrichness and diversity? \nSocietal Structures and AI \nOur research underscores a pivotal realization: technology does not operate in a vacuum. LLMs, \nand AI at large, are products of human society, imbibing its values, biases, and narratives. Thus, \nwhile technical interventions can modulate AI outputs, a more sustainable solution lies in \naddressing the societal structures that birth these biases. \n\"De-biasing\" AI isn't merely a technical endeavour; it's a societal one. If our training data is a \nreflection of our society, then the quest for unbiased AI is intrinsically linked with the quest for a \nmore equitable and just society. \n \n \n \nDwivedi et al | Page 15 of 18 \n \nThe Way Forward \nGiven the findings and implications, several pathways emerge for future exploration: \na. Interdisciplinary Collaboration: The need for technologists to collaborate with linguists, \nsociologists, ethicists, and gender studies experts has never been more evident. Only \nthrough such interdisciplinary endeavours can we hope to shape AI systems that are both \ntechnologically sound and societally responsible. \nb. User Agency: One promising direction is to allow users greater agency in determining the \n\"values\" of their AI tools. Personalized guardrails, where users can set their preferences \nregarding content neutrality and bias, could be a way to balance between universality and \npersonalization. \nc. Continuous Learning:  AI models, particularly LLMs, should be seen as entities in \ncontinuous evolution. Regular updates, guided by both user feedback and societal \nchanges, can ensure that these models remain relevant and aligned with desired values. \nd. Open Source Initiatives:  Encouraging open -source AI research can democratize the \nprocess of AI development, allowing for diverse perspectives to shape these models, thus \nreducing the risk of any singular or dominant bias taking hold. \ne. Public Awareness: Beyond the realm of technologists and researchers, public awareness \nabout the capabilities, limitations, and biases of AI is crucial. An informed user base can \ncritically engage with AI, ensuring that they harness its benefits without being unduly \ninfluenced by its outputs. \n \nFinal Reflections \nThe journey into understanding gender representation in LLMs has been as enlightening as it has \nbeen challenging. The dance between technology and society, biases and neutrality, and ethics \nand functionality is intricate. \nHowever, amidst these complexities lies an undeniable truth: the future of AI is not just in the \nhands of technologists but in the collective hands of society. As we progressively weave AI into \nthe fabric of our daily lives, the responsibility to shape it, guide it, and refine it is a collective one.  \nIn the tapestry of the AI-enabled future, each thread, be it technology, ethics, society, or individual \nagency, has a role to play. And as we continue this journey, it's paramount to remember that while \nAI might be machines' output, its soul is indelibly human. \n \nDeclaration of Conflicts of Interests \nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest. \nFunding Disclosure/Acknowledgement \nThe author(s) declared that no funding has been received for research or publication. \n \nRupkatha 15:4 2023 | Page 16 of 18 \n \nReferences \nAlec, R., Jeffrey, W., Rewon, C., David, L., Dario, A., & Ilya, S.
