Precise forecasting plays a crucial role in assisting\nvarious real-world applications, including climate report [ 1, 50],\npatient vital sign assessments [30], urban computing [24] and stock\nprediction[23] etc. Various efforts have been devoted to this area for\nmore accurate forecasting. Notably, deep-learning-based methods\nhave achieved great success due to their capability to capture both\ntemporal and cross-dimension dependencies [28, 31, 51].\nOn the other hand, inspired by recent significant advancements\nin pretraining methods in both the NLP and CV fields [3, 12, 18, 20],\nvarious pretraining-based time series analysis methods have been\nproposed [49]. The contrastive learning technique is widely em-\nployed in the discriminative pretraining methods, where the models\n1https://github.com/icantnamemyself/GPHT\narXiv:2402.16516v2  [cs.LG]  18 Jun 2024\nKDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain. Zhiding Liu et al.\nare expected to learn representations from constructed positive and\nnegative pairs [42, 45]. Furthermore, the incorporation of gener-\native targets, such as masked time-series modeling, into the pre-\ntraining task has also been well-studied, with the aim of extracting\ngeneral knowledge during the reconstruction process [ 7, 13, 38].\nAdditionally, considering the shared characteristics between time\nseries and natural languages, some recent studies have emerged\nto adapt pre-trained language models into accurate forecasters\nthrough prompting or fine-tuning [19, 54]. All these methods have\nachieved significant success, even competing effectively with su-\npervised forecasting approaches.\nDespite their effectiveness, there remain significant challenges\nin promoting the performance of the pretrained forecasters. Firstly,\nthe limited scale of the dataset is a critical issue. The standard prac-\ntice of these methods involves pretraining on a single real-world\nor synthetic dataset, and evaluating its performance on this dataset\nor other datasets through transfer learning [10, 14]. However, the\namount of training instances in a single dataset is often limited\n[17], and its inherent patterns may fail to encompass the complex\nscenarios of other datasets, leading to suboptimal forecasting accu-\nracy and transferability. Secondly, nearly all forecasting approaches\nadhere to the one-step generation schema [52], which implies that\nthe predictions for all future time steps are generated through a\nsingle forward pass with a customized forecasting head determined\nby a specified horizon length. The drawbacks of this paradigm are\nmultifaceted. On the one hand, the temporal dependencies within\nthe predicted series are inevitably overlooked, potentially leading to\nan inferior result. On the other hand, the tailored forecasting head\nhinders the generalizability of the pretrained models, as multiple\nmodels are required for different horizon length settings.\nTo alleviate the above challenges, we are motivated to explore\npretraining a single unified forecasting model that generalizes\nwell across diverse data scenarios and forecasting settings with\na novel generative hierarchical transformer architecture, namely\nGPHT. Firstly for the dataset construction, we extend the channel-\nindependent assumption [46] into multiple data scenarios, simply\nmixing time series originating from various scopes as a whole\nwithout considering extra information, which provides vast charac-\nteristics such as diverse periodicities that benefit the pertaining pro-\ncedure. Besides, to better capture the commonalities and specialties\nwithin the mixed dataset, we naturally introduce a novel hierar-\nchical transformer architecture as the backbone model [4, 37]. Fur-\nthermore, we formulate the forecasting task as a standard language\nmodeling task with the patching technique [8, 31], which projects\ntime series into token-level representations, and an auto-regressive\noptimization function is applied in our pretraining procedure to re-\nplace the conventional one-step generating schema. Consequently,\nthe model can well model the temporal dependencies in the forecast-\ning horizons at a token-wise level through auto-regressive inference\nand can be seamlessly adapted to diverse datasets with varying\nhorizon length settings without any modification. We compare our\nmodel’s performance with state-of-the-art supervised and pretrain-\ning methods under various fine-tuning and zero/few-shot learning\nsettings. The results demonstrate the superiority and generalizabil-\nity of the proposed GPHT.\nIn summary, our contributions are as follows:\n•We explore pretraining a single unified forecasting model\nthat generalizes well across diverse scenarios with the pre-\ntraining dataset constructed under the channel-independent\nassumption, which allows for the easy creation of diverse,\nlarge-scale datasets, forming the foundation for the general-\nizability across data scenarios of the forecasting model.\n•We introduce GPHT, a novel hierarchical transformer fore-\ncasting in an auto-regressive manner. This design inherently\naids in modeling both the commonalities and specialties\nwithin the mixed dataset, guaranteeing universality under\nvarious forecasting settings.\n•We conduct sufficient experiments on 8 widely used bench-\nmark datasets, comparing our proposed GPHT with main-\nstream supervised and pretraining methods. The results\nshow that our model surpasses the baseline models across\nvarious fine-tuning and zero/few-shot learning settings.\n2 RELATED WORKS\n2.1 Time Series Forecasting\nTime series forecasting is a crucial task with broad applications,\ngarnering significant attention in recent years. Early research pre-\ndominantly focuses on statistical methods such as ARIMA [2, 48],\nwhich builds an auto-regressive model and forecasts in a moving\naverage fashion. However, these methods may encounter limita-\ntions in long-term forecasting settings. The advent of deep learning\nhas led to the development of numerous models capturing both\ntemporal and cross-dimensional dependencies in multivariate time\nseries, utilizing modern architectures [9, 26, 29, 34, 36].\nTransformer-based and MLP-based approaches have emerged\nas research hotspots due to their outstanding performance [5, 27,\n46]. Beyond model architecture, several customized techniques\nrooted in time series analysis have been established. These in-\nclude trend-seasonal decomposition [44], time-frequency conver-\nsion [53], series stabilization [25], and patching [31]. The integra-\ntion of these advanced studies enables contemporary forecasters\nto achieve unprecedented accuracy in predictions across diverse\nscenarios through supervised training.\n2.2 Self-supervised Pretraining in Time Series\nModeling\n2.2.1 Discriminative methods. Contrastive learning is widely uti-\nlized in the discriminative time series modeling approaches, aiming\nto derive crucial representations from pre-defined positive and\nnegative pairs. A key challenge lies in effectively constructing in-\nformative instance pairs.\nIn practice, TNC [39] takes advantage of the local smoothness\nof a signal’s generative process to define neighborhoods in time\nwith stationary properties, and TS2Vec [ 45] proposes to employ\ncontrastive learning on both instance level and patch level in a hi-\nerarchical way for robust contextual representation learning. More-\nover, TS-TCC [15] introduces a new contrastive learning task of\ncross-view prediction. Subsequently, CoST [42] comprises both time\ndomain and frequency domain contrastive losses to learn discrimi-\nnative trend and seasonal representations. Note that discriminative\nmethods primarily concentrate on coarse-grained instance-level\nGenerative Pretrained Hierarchical Transformer for\nTime Series Forecasting KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain.\ninformation, leading to unsatisfactory performance in forecasting\ntasks where fine-grained temporal features are essential.\n2.2.2 Generative methods. Generative pretraining methods usually\nfollow a paradigm of reconstruction. In the context of time series\nanalysis, the objective of masked time-series modeling has been ex-\ntensively explored. TST [47] pioneers the use of traditional masked\nmodeling, aiming to predict the removed time series points based\non the remaining ones. Subsequently, STEP [ 38] and PatchTST\n[31] expand on this concept to a sub-series level, where local infor-\nmation is more effectively captured, and computational costs are\nsignificantly reduced. Furthermore, a recent study [ 13] achieves\nsuperior fine-tuning performance by introducing a novel masked\nmodeling task, involving the reconstruction of the original time\nseries from multiple randomly masked series. Besides, TimeMAE\n[7] significantly surpasses previous competitive baselines in clas-\nsification tasks by leveraging decoupled masked autoencoders to\nlearn robust representations through two pretext tasks: masked\ncodeword classification and masked representation regression.\nOn the other hand, the forecast-as-pretraining schema has also\nbeen a subject of recent research. ForecastPFN [ 14] introduces a\nprior-data fitted network trained on synthetic data and achieves\naccurate zero-shot forecasting on univariate time series. Besides,\nboth TimeGPT-1 [ 16] and PreDcT [ 10] explore the potential of\ntraining a foundation model for forecasting, yielding zero-shot fore-\ncasting capability under relatively short horizon lengths. Moreover,\nthere is another related line of work focusing on adapting tradi-\ntional pretrained generative language models to the time series\ndomain, either through prompting [19] or fine-tuning [54]. These\napproaches have demonstrated competitive results when compared\nto the traditional supervised approaches.\nDespite the effectiveness, existing methods exhibit two key short-\ncomings. Firstly, these models are typically trained on a single\ndataset with limited scale and patterns, impeding their ability to\ngeneralize to diverse forecasting scenarios. Secondly, both super-\nvised and self-supervised approaches often necessitate a customized\nforecasting head, incurring multiple training costs under different\nhorizon length settings. Regarding our proposed method, GPHT, it\nstands out as a generative self-supervised pretraining approach, dis-\ntinguishing itself from existing methods by effectively addressing\nthese issues. In detail, we investigate the feasibility of constructing a\nmixed dataset for training our model in an auto-regressive manner.\nThis approach ensures the superior generalizability of GPHT, al-\nlowing it to be seamlessly adapted to any dataset, including unseen\ndatasets, and forecast at arbitrary horizon lengths. Notably, experi-\nments demonstrate that our method surpasses the baseline models\nacross various fine-tuning and zero/few-shot learning settings in\nthe traditional long-term forecasting task.\n3 PROPOSED METHOD\nIn this section, we will delve into the specifics of the proposed GPHT\nmethod illustrated in Figure 1, demonstrating its capacity to effi-\nciently acquire precise time series forecasting through pretraining\non the mixed dataset.\n3.1 Problem Definition\nGiven an input series X∈ R𝐶×𝐿, a time series forecasting model is\ntasked with precisely predicting future values Y∈ R𝐶×𝐻. Here, 𝐿,\n𝐻, and 𝐶 represent the lookback window length, horizon length,\nand the number of channels, respectively.\nGPHT adopts the channel-independent assumption [ 31, 46],\ntreating each multivariate time series as multiple independent uni-\nvariate time series. In essence, GPHT conducts individual fore-\ncasting on each variate within the input series, and the resultant\nforecasts are concatenated to generate the final predictions.\nMoreover, we extend this methodology to the construction of\nthe mixed pretraining dataset, where the heterogeneity of each\nvariable is discarded and no extra information is taken into account.\nIt can be therefore seamlessly applied to more diverse scenarios\nwhere the covariate information may be missing and the data itself\nmay be synthetic. In practice, we concatenate the training segments\nfrom various real-world datasets to constitute the training set of the\nmixed dataset. This process is similarly applied to the validation and\ntesting portions. Our approach ensures that GPHT is pretrained on a\nrich variety of temporal patterns, thereby enhancing its adaptability\nand generalization capabilities across diverse time series domains.\n3.2 Series Tokenization\nGiven that the majority of time series originate from signals cap-\ntured by real-world sensors, the data inherently carry noise, and\ninformation is often sparsely distributed across the time points.\nConsequently, employing auto-regressive training on point-wise\ntime series might yield suboptimal performance due to the risk of\noverfitting outliers and the associated error accumulation [52], in\naddition to incurring high computation costs.\nTo address these challenges, we employ the series tokenization\ntechnique, a proven effective approach in time series modeling\n[22, 31, 51]. Specifically, we adopt a non-overlapping tokenization\nstrategy, reshaping the input seriesXinto a sequence of time series\ntokens, 𝑥 ∈R𝐶×𝐿′×𝑇, where 𝑇 ×𝐿′ = 𝐿, 𝑇 represents the token\nlength, and 𝐿′can be considered as the sequence length. The to-\nkenization strategy not only helps mitigate the impact of noise\nand sparse information distribution but also enhances the model’s\nability to better capture the local semantics, ultimately contributing\nto more robust and accurate time series forecasting.\nFurthermore, recent research has highlighted a prevalent issue\nin time series data, characterized by a distribution shift [11, 28, 33]\nwhich means that the mean and variance of time series changes\nover time. This challenge significantly hinders the generalizability\nof deep-learning-based forecasters. The impact of this phenome-\nnon is even more pronounced in the context of pretraining on a\nmixed dataset, where series inherently stem from distinct tempo-\nral distributions. To mitigate this issue, we introduce an Instance\nNormalization layer [25], designed to address the distribution shift\nproblem by normalizing the input series using the formula:\n𝑥𝑖𝑛 = 𝑥−𝜇\n𝜎+𝜖 and 𝜇 = E[X],𝜎2 = Var[X]. (1)\nHere, 𝜖 is a small constant, and 𝜇,𝜎 represent the instance-specific\nmean and standard deviation of X, respectively. Subsequently,𝑥0\n𝑖𝑛\nis fed into the model for further feature extraction. This normal-\nization step enhances the model’s robustness to distribution shifts,\nKDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain.

(b) Pretrained on the mixed dataset with the multi-stage hierarchical transformer blocks, GPHT excels\nin capturing the commonalities among time series originating from various data scenarios.\npromoting more effective learning and improved generalization\nacross diverse temporal patterns.\n3.3 Hierarchical Transformer Blocks\nMulti-scale representation learning has demonstrated its effective-\nness in various time series modeling tasks [6, 37], given the multiple\nperiodic characteristics commonly found in real-world time series\ndata. Furthermore, to better discover commonalities hidden within\nmixed datasets comprising various data scenarios, we posit the\nindispensability of a hierarchical encoder.\nIn practice, drawing inspiration from the multi-rate sampling\nstrategy [4], we introduce a token-level multi-stage representa-\ntion learning approach within our hierarchical transformer blocks:\nSuppose 𝑥𝑖 is the input series after tokenization of stage 𝑖, a max-\npooling operation with a kernel size of 𝑘𝑖 is applied on each token,\ndown-sampling the original data into 𝑥𝑖\n𝑖𝑛 ∈R𝐶×𝐿′×𝑇\n𝑘𝑖 . This opera-\ntion retains a coarse-grained portion of the original data, compelling\nthe encoder network to focus on modeling coarse patterns. After-\nward, a standard multi-layer transformer network is employed for\nrepresentation learning [40]:\nℎ𝑖𝑛\n𝑖 = 𝑃𝐸𝑖(𝑥𝑖𝑛\n𝑖 )+𝐸𝑚𝑏𝑖(𝑥𝑖𝑛\n𝑖 )\nℎ𝑜𝑢𝑡\n𝑖 = 𝑇𝑅𝑀𝑖(ℎ𝑖𝑛\n𝑖 ).\n(2)\nHere, 𝑃𝐸 represents a regular position embedding layer, and𝐸𝑚𝑏is\na token projection layer projecting a time series token into the hid-\nden space of the transformer. Besides, we employ the decoder-only\ntransformers as the backbone, which incorporates causal attention\nmasks to prevent information leakage during the auto-regressive\ngenerating process.\nFinally, the learned hidden statesℎ𝑜𝑢𝑡\n𝑖 are fed into the forecasting\nhead, which is a linear layer, to predict future values for each token.\nIn this regard, we adopt an up-sampling operation, which can be\neither linear interpolation or MLP, to map the predictions back\nto the original time series tokens, yielding the predictions 𝑥𝑖\n𝑜𝑢𝑡 of\nstage 𝑖. This process is represented as:\n𝑥𝑖\n𝑜𝑢𝑡 = 𝑈𝑝𝑆𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑔 (𝐹𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑠𝑡 (ℎ𝑜𝑢𝑡\n𝑖 )). (3)\nThis comprehensive approach to multi-stage representation learn-\ning and forecasting allows for the capturing of intricate temporal\npatterns at different scales, contributing to the model’s effectiveness\nin handling diverse time series scenarios.\n3.4 Iterative Residual Learning\nUtilizing the multi-stage hierarchical transformer blocks, GPHT\nis expected to learn coarse-to-fine representations effectively. To\nfully leverage these representations, we propose a novel iterative\nresidual learning strategy [ 21, 32], transforming the forecasting\nprocess into an iterative approach.\nSpecifically, as illustrated in Figure 1, the input of stage 𝑖+1 is\nthe residual of stage 𝑖’s input and output, defined as:\n𝑥𝑖+1\n𝑖𝑛 = 𝑥𝑖\n𝑖𝑛 −𝑃𝑎𝑑𝐹𝑖𝑟𝑠𝑡𝑇𝑜𝑘𝑒𝑛 (𝑥𝑖\n𝑜𝑢𝑡). (4)\nTaking advantage of the auto-regressive training schema, each\ntoken in𝑥𝑖\n𝑜𝑢𝑡 can be considered as the predicted value of the next to-\nken corresponding to the token in𝑥𝑖\n𝑖𝑛. For the regression of the first\ntoken, we adopt a zero-padding for simplicity. Therefore, Equation\n4 effectively refines the input for the next stage, eliminating\nthe redundant information in the series .\nGenerative Pretrained Hierarchical Transformer for\nTime Series Forecasting KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain.\nIntuitively, the pooling operation within the hierarchical trans-\nformers allows the model to concentrate on specific patterns at\nlower frequencies. Additionally, the task of deeper blocks is simpli-\nfied as the shallower layers filter out the well-approximated signals.\nTherefore, the iterative residual learning strategy enables the model\nto focus on refining the finer details, allowing for the progressive\nenhancement of the predictive accuracy. Moreover, the strategy\nnaturally suits the diverse patterns in the mixed pretraining dataset\nwith adaptability to various temporal structures, thus guaranteeing\npromising generalizability.\n3.5 Optimization Target\nLet 𝑆 represent the number of stages, the intermediate forecasting\nresult of GPHT is the sum of all the outputs of each hierarchical\ntransformer block, defined as:\n𝑦𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑 =\n𝑆∑︁\n𝑖=1\n𝑥𝑖\n𝑜𝑢𝑡. (5)\nBesides, a Reversed Instance Normalization layer is applied to\nthe intermediate result through de-normalization, restoring the\ncharacteristics of the input series for better accuracy [25]:\nY𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑 = 𝑦𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑 ·(𝜎+𝜖)+𝜇. (6)\nTo fully leverage the mixed dataset and better capture tempo-\nral dependencies, we formulate the pretraining task as a standard\nlanguage modeling task, employing a token-wise auto-regressive\nloss function as the optimization target (which is also a forecasting\ntask). Using the same notations as in Section 3.1, and letting 𝐻 = 𝑇,\nthe optimization target of GPHT is:\n𝐿= 𝑀𝑆𝐸(Y𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑,𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑐𝑎𝑡 (X[:,𝑇 :],Y)) (7)\nHere, we use the standard Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the next-\ntoken-prediction loss function, as time series tokens are still con-\ntinuous numerical values.\n3.6 Inference\nGiven that the pretraining task can be considered a forecasting task,\nthe pre-trained GPHT can be directly applied to downstream\nforecasting tasks without any modification . This sets our ap-\nproach apart from mainstream pretraining methods [7, 13, 45, 54],\nwhere a fine-tuning procedure is typically required.\nOn the other hand, we argue that the performance of GPHT can\nalso be further enhanced through fine-tuning. In practice, to strike\na balance between maintaining generalizability and improving per-\nformance on a specific dataset, we adopt a parameter-efficient tun-\ning strategy. Specifically, only the forecasting heads described in\nEquation 3 are updated during the fine-tuning process. Importantly,\nthese forecasting head parameters account for less than 0.5% of the\nentire model.\nDuring inference, benefiting from the aforementioned training\nschema and the channel-independent assumption, GPHT is theo-\nretically capable of conducting universal forecasting on any input\nmulti-variate time series, regardless of arbitrary horizon lengths.\nThe forecasting process is akin to the decoding process of a lan-\nguage model. Given any input X, our model can initially predict\nthe next first token. This predicted token is then concatenated to\nthe end of the input series to generate predictions for the second\ntoken. Note that a max input length 𝐿𝑚 exists in our model due\nto the positional embeddings and heavy computation cost when\naddressing long sequences. Consequently, only the most recent 𝐿𝑚\ntokens are fed into the model for forecasting.\n4 EXPERIMENTS\nIn this section, we conduct sufficient experiments on 8 widely used\ndatasets in comparison with mainstream self-supervised pretraining\nmethods and supervised methods to illustrate the effectiveness of\nour proposed GPHT.\n4.1 Experimental Setup\n4.1.1 Datasets. Table 1 provides detailed descriptions of the used\ndatasets, covering various data scenarios and scales. Among them,\nboth ETT2 and Electricity3 mainly records the consumption on\nelectricity, and ETT can be further divided into 4 subsets according\nto the frequency. Besides, Exchange4 collects the daily exchange\nrate among 8 countries, Traffic5 contains the data of traffic load\nsensors, and Weather6 is made up of 21 climate indicators like\nair temperature. Following the standard protocol, we split each\ndataset into training, validation and testing sets according to the\nchronological order.

The performance of these methods effectively repre-\nsents the utmost accuracy achievable by current forecasting models.\n4.1.3 Implementation Details. We employ ADAM as the default\noptimizer throughout all the experiments and use mean squared er-\nror (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) as the evaluation metrics.\nA lower MSE/MAE indicates better performance. For the baseline\nmodels, we implement them with official codes and recommended\nparameter settings.\nAs for GPHT, we set the token length 𝑇 to 48, and the max\ninput length 𝐿𝑚 is set to 7 to accommodate the lookback window\nlength. The model comprises 4 stages of hierarchical transformer\nblocks, each with three-layer decoder-only transformers. The down-\nsampling ratio for each stage is set to [8,4,2,1]respectively. All\nexperiments are conducted for three runs with a fixed random seed\non a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 24GB GPU.\n4.2 Main Results\nWe report the long-term multi-variate forecasting results in Ta-\nble 2. For a fair comparison, the lookback window length 𝐿is set\nto 336 for every model and dataset, and the horizon length 𝐻 is\n[96,192,336,720]following the standard protocol. Here, GPHT*\ndenotes our model pretrained on the mixed dataset without any\nmodification, while GPHT represents the fine-tuned version for\neach dataset, as described in Section 3.6.\nAs shown in the table, we can draw some interesting conclusions.\nFirstly, self-supervised methods showcase competitive performance\nwith their supervised counterparts, underscoring the efficacy of\nGenerative Pretrained Hierarchical Transformer for\nTime Series Forecasting KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain.\nadvanced pretraining techniques. Secondly, the tokenization tech-\nnique emerges as a crucial factor in achieving precise forecast-\ning, as evidenced by the outstanding performance of both FPT\nand patchTST among the baseline models. Finally, it appears that\nmodern forecasters have approached the precision limits of some\nbenchmark datasets, likely due to inherent noise and unpredictable\ndistribution shifts in the data. This phenomenon results in minimal\ndifferences in outcomes among various models.\nOn the other hand, in terms of our proposed GPHT, it consis-\ntently surpasses its competitors across most experimental settings.\nThe tuned GPHT model establishes the most accurate forecasting\nunder over 65% cases with its powerful counterparts. Specifically,\nGPHT exhibits an average MSE reduction of 9.23% on the Ex-\nchange dataset, 1.60% on the Traffic dataset, and 3.00% on the\nETTh1 dataset, in comparison with the best baseline under all ex-\nperimental forecasting lengths. Regarding MAE evaluation, the\nimprovements are more pronounced at 5.30%, 3.97%, and 5.07%\nrespectively. Although the relative improvements under certain\nsettings may not be as substantial, as we claimed before, the con-\nsistently superior performance provides strong evidence for the\neffectiveness of our approach. This further demonstrates that our\nmodel can better capture temporal dependencies in various data\nscenarios, benefiting from its pretraining on the mixed dataset.\nBesides, it is noteworthy that our model exhibits superior per-\nformance at relatively shorter horizon lengths. Specifically, GPHT\nsurpasses PatchTST on every dataset when 𝐻 = 96, resulting in an\naverage MAE reduction of 4.55%. We attribute this performance\nboost to the explicit modeling of temporal dependencies in the\noutput series. On the other hand, due to the inevitable error accu-\nmulation issue caused by the auto-regressive forecasting schema,\nthe superiority of GPHT decreases with longer 𝐻s and the the\naverage reduction of MAE comes to 3.38% when 𝐻 = 720.\nEven more surprisingly, GPHT*, representing the model after\npretraining without any fine-tuning or modification , proves\nto be competitive with the baseline models. Specifically, GPHT*\nachieves the best or the second-best performance in 26 out of all\n64 settings. When compared to a single model, it outperforms FPT\nand supervised PatchTST under 44 and 40 experimental settings,\nrespectively. This result validates the feasibility of learning the com-\nmonalities of different time series by training on the mixed dataset\nwith the channel-independent assumption. It also underscores the\nincredible generalizability of our proposed model, primarily owing\nto the specially designed multi-stage hierarchical blocks and the\niterative residual learning strategy.\n4.3 Zero-shot Evaluation\nTo further highlight GPHT’s capacity to learn general knowledge\nand discover common patterns from the mixed dataset, we con-\nduct zero-shot forecasting experiments on the Exchange, Weather,\nand Traffic datasets, originating from various data scenarios with\ndistinct scales. The zero-shot forecasting task is conceptually chal-\nlenging for methods that model cross-variable dependencies, hence,\nonly the channel-independent models are considered as baseline\nmodels. It is important to note that ForecastPFN [14] is specifically\ndesigned for zero-shot forecasting, but its performance is heavily\ncontingent on how the training data is synthesized, and as such, it\nis not included in this experiment. The models are trained on the\nmixed dataset comprised of the remaining 7 datasets and evaluated\ndirectly on the target dataset. The results are presented in Table 3.\nTable 3: Comparison on zero-shot forecasting task.

We\nattribute this success primarily to the multi-stage hierarchical trans-\nformer blocks, designed to capture diverse temporal patterns with\ndifferent resolutions. Consequently, GPHT exhibits better trans-\nferability to unseen time series. Additionally, all models achieve\nforecasting accuracy at an acceptable error level, with DLinear even\ndemonstrating unprecedented precision on the Exchange dataset\nwhen 𝐻 = 720. These results strongly validate the feasibility of\nour approach to learning commonalities in time series through\npretraining on a mixed dataset.\n4.4 Few-shot Evaluation\nIn real-world applications, the initial observation of time series\nmay be of a limited size, posing challenges for training accurate\nforecasters. To evaluate the representation power of GPHT under\nsuch circumstances, we conduct few-shot evaluations on the ETT\nand Electricity dataset. In detail, only a portion (10% or 5%, following\nexisting work [54]) of the training instances are used for training\nthe models, and we evaluate their MSE and MAE on the full test\nset. The results are reported in Table 4.\nIn comparison to the selected baseline models, GPHT consis-\ntently achieves superior performance across various experimental\nsettings, particularly on small-scale datasets. Specifically, when\ncompared to the best-performing baseline in the 10% setting, GPHT\ndemonstrates a relative average MSE reduction of16.02% and 7.02%\non the ETTh1 and ETTh2 datasets, respectively. With a further re-\nduction in the training data to only 5%, the relative improvements\nbecome even more pronounced, reaching30.19% and 12.49%. How-\never, it is noteworthy that GPHT exhibits poor forecasting perfor-\nmance on the ETTm1 dataset.

Addressing\nhow to identify and leverage dataset heterogeneities for enhanced\npretraining remains a subject for future exploration.\n4.5 Ablation Study\n4.5.1 Hierarchical Architecture. In this section, we explore the in-\nfluence of hierarchical transformer blocks on GPHT’s performance.\nWe present the averaged MSE and MAE evaluations for GPHT\nwith varying stages of hierarchical transformer blocks across all\nbenchmark datasets, considering a forecasting horizon of 𝐻 = 720\n(see Figure 2). As the number of stages increases, GPHT is theoret-\nically better equipped to capture diverse temporal dependencies\nwithin the mixed dataset, such as different periodicities. The results\nstrongly affirm our hypothesis, as the 4-stage GPHT surpasses the\n1-stage GPHT (without hierarchical structures), achieving a notable\n2.86% reduction in MSE.\n4.5.2 On the Effect of Pretraining. In addition to the architecture\ndesign, another key aspect is the pretraining procedure on the\nmixed dataset. Does it pose positive effects on the forecasting per-\nformance? We provide quantified results in Figure 3. Specifically, we\ncompare the performance of fine-tuned GPHT with the one trained\nfrom scratch. The MAE evaluations averaged on the horizon length\n(i.e., 𝐻 = 96,192,336,720) are presented. From the results, we can\ninfer that pretraining on the mixed dataset enables the model to\nleverage commonalities among time series, facilitating better trans-\nfer to specific datasets. Compared to GPHT trained from scratch,\npretraining results in an average MAE reduction of5.75%, reaching\nas high as 9.65% on the ETTm2 dataset.\n0.408\n0.410\n0.412\n0.414\n0.416\n0.418\n0.420\n0.422\n0.424\n0.426\n0.428\n0.435\n0.440\n0.445\n0.450\n0.455\n0.460\n1 2 3 4 5\nMAE\nMSE\nNumber of the stages of hierarchical transformer blocks\nMSE MAE\nFigure 2: Performance comparison between GHPT with dif-\nferent stages of hierarchical transformer blocks.\n0.000\n0.050\n0.100\n0.150\n0.200\n0.250\n0.300\n0.350\n0.400\n0.450\n0.500MAE\nw/ pretrain w/o pretrain\nFigure 3: MAE evaluation between GPHT and GPHT without\npretraining on benchmark datasets.\nGenerative Pretrained Hierarchical Transformer for\nTime Series Forecasting KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain.\n5 CONCLUSION\nIn this work, we proposed a generative pretrained hierarchical\ntransformer model, namely GPHT, for time series forecasting. It\nstands out in two key aspects. Conceptually, we explored training a\nsingle unified forecasting model that generalizes well across diverse\ndata scenarios and forecasting settings. Technically, we proposed\na simple yet effective paradigm that treats time series originating\nfrom various scopes as a whole, discarding the heterogeneity and\nconcatenating the values of each variable from different datasets\nto form the mixed dataset for pretraining. Besides, we replaced\nconventional one-step generating, which is adopted by most recent\nforecasting methods, with auto-regressive decoding for better flexi-\nbility and performance. We also introduced the hierarchical struc-\nture better to capture the diverse patterns in the mixed dataset. We\nconducted sufficient experiments on 8 widely used datasets in com-\nparison with mainstream self-supervised pretraining models and\nsupervised models, the results demonstrated that GPHT surpasses\nthe baseline models across various fine-tuning and zero/few-shot\nlearning settings in the traditional long-term forecasting task.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis research was supported by grants from the Joint Research\nProject of the Science and Technology Innovation Community in\nYangtze River Delta (No. 2023CSJZN0200), and the Fundamental\nResearch Funds for the Central Universities.

Advances in neural information\nprocessing systems 36 (2023), 43322–43355.\nA COMPLEXITY COMPARISON\nTo better illustrate the proposed GPHT model’s computation cost,\nwe provide quantitative results on the Electricity dataset under\nlookback window 𝐿 = 336 and forecasting horizon 𝐻 = 720 in\nTable 5. In summary, the proposed GPHT model is medium-sized\ncompared to the baseline models. Thanks to its straightforward\noptimization objective, both the pretraining and finetuning pro-\ncesses of GPHT are quite efficient and do not require too much\ntime, especially compared with the pretraining-based approaches.\nA key drawback of our model might be the inference speed, which\nis naturally limited by the auto-regressive decoding schema.\nB QUALITATIVE EVALUATION\nIn this section, we provide visualizations of long-term forecasting\nresults to better demonstrate the performance of GPHT and the\neffectiveness of the hierarchical transformer architecture.\nWe plot a forecasting sample in Figure 4, illustrating how GPHT\nforecasts with the hierarchical architecture and the iterative residual\nschema. It can be referred that the initial stages predominantly\nfocus on extracting the general periodic patterns from the input\nseries and the latter stages can therefore pay more attention to the\nspecialized trends, since the auto-regressive forecasting results of\nstage 3 align more closely with the input series, albeit with less\nperiodicity than the preceding stages. The results strongly verify\nour assumption that the hierarchical architecture can better capture\nthe commonalities and specialties of the mixed pertaining dataset,\nand the iterative residual schema effectively refines the input for\nthe next stage, eliminating the redundant information in the series.\nBesides, we provide qualitative comparison between GPHT and\nmainstream supervised forecasting methods in Figure 5 on various\ndatasets. Benefiting from the auto-regressive pertaining and the\nhierarchical architecture, GPHT can better capture the temporal\ndependencies so as to achieve better performance.\nGenerative Pretrained Hierarchical Transformer for\nTime Series Forecasting KDD ’24, August 25–29, 2024, Barcelona, Spain.\nTable 5: Computation cost between GPHT and mainstream forecasting approaches.\nMethods Params Training Time(per epoch) Inference Speed(itr/s)\nGPHT 37.98M(pretraining)/98.50K(finetuning) 20min(pretraining)/254.1s(finetuning) 0.34\nFPT 105.20M(24.00M trainable) 3858.8s(finetuning) 0.69\nSimMTM 62.14M(pretraining)/7.76M(finetuning) 73min(pretraining)/946.5s(finetuning) 5.98\nPatchTST 4.27M 128.9s 9.02\niTransformer 5.28M 24.7s 26.39\nTimesNet 150.64M 1179.6s 1.51\nFigure 4: Visualization of the input and corresponding output series of GPHT’s multiple stages on a sample from the ETTh1\ndataset.\n(a) GPHT (b) PatchTST (c) iTransformer (d) DLinear\nETTh1\n Exchange\nTraffic\nFigure 5: Illustration of forecasting showcases comparing GPHT and baseline models.
