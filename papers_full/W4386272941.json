ACM, New York, NY, USA, 11 pages. https:\n//doi.org/10.1145/3581783.3613767\n1 INTRODUCTION\nThe rapid development of advanced multimedia editing software\nenabled by artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) [ 1, 5,\n22, 30, 32, 43, 54, 56] has raised concerns about its potential misuse,\nsuch as manipulating public opinion and fabricating evidence. This\nhas led to a growing interest in developing methods for detecting\nmanipulated content in multimedia forensics, with a primary focus\non deepfake detection [13, 28, 60, 63, 65] in facial and audio media.\nDespite the promising results demonstrated by these methods in\na variety of benchmarks [14, 15, 17, 27, 46, 66], their mainstream\nadoption by the industry remains limited due to the constraint of\nbinary classification tasks. These methods are inadequate for iden-\ntifying the temporal boundaries of manipulations, which is crucial\nfor practical applications. Further research is necessary to develop\ntechniques that can accurately locate temporal boundaries of ma-\nnipulations in multimedia content and promote the responsible use\nof AIGC for the betterment of society.\nRecent studies [6, 11, 21, 58] have proposed a new task called\ntemporal forgery localization (TFL) to overcome the limitations of\nbinary classification in detecting manipulated content in multime-\ndia. TFL aims to locate the start and end timestamps of manipulated\nsegments, providing a wider range of application scenarios and\nhelping users better understand the results of forgery detection.\nTFL is similar to temporal action localization (TAL) [23, 45, 50] and\nfollows a similar process: pre-processing the video or audio data\nusing a pre-trained feature extractor, enhancing the representation\nof feature vectors with a designed neural network architecture, and\ndecoding the feature vectors using regression and classification\nheads to obtain the start and end times of each action segment and\ntheir corresponding categories. Note that this process may vary\ndepending on specific task requirements.\narXiv:2308.14395v1  [cs.MM]  28 Aug 2023\nMM ’23, October 29-November 3, 2023, Ottawa, ON, Canada Rui Zhang et al.\nInpainting Results\nTime\nInput Masks\nOriginal FramesModified Frames\nFigure 1: We show a collection of keyframes extracted from manipulated videos where a person has been removed, posing a\nserious threat to digital evidence integrity. The original person mask is displayed on the left with the corresponding video\ninpainting results underneath it, while the unmanipulated results are shown on the right with a green background. Of the 144\nframes in the video, only 11 involve person removal, and it only takes minor modifications to a small section of the video to\nachieve this. This manipulation technique has drawn significant attention in forensic video analysis because manipulated\nvideos may be presented as genuine evidence in legal proceedings and can be difficult to detect using classification-based\nmethods.\nTFL tasks present unique challenges compared to TAL. Firstly,\nreal-world scenarios often involve various modalities, including\naudio-only, visual-only, and audio-visual data, requiring separate\nmodels for manipulation detection and potentially delaying TFL\ntechnology development. Secondly, unmodified or real samples are\nessential in TFL, just like background samples, but they are often\nneglected in TAL. Thirdly, manipulation changes are usually more\nsubtle than action changes, with minor alterations like a single\nword or short pronunciation time making detection more challeng-\ning. Finally, the lack of available datasets is a significant bottleneck\nfor TFL. Most multimedia forgery datasets evaluate manipulation\nperformance over the entire video or audio. Only a few studies\nhave validated TFL performance, limited to a single dataset such\nas Lav-DF [6] for the visual domain and Psynd [58] for the audio\ndomain. Besides, available datasets for TFL [6, 21, 58] and deepfake\ndetection [17, 27, 66] primarily focus on facial manipulations and\nspeech forgeries, while AIGC still poses a threat in other scenarios.\nThis narrow scope limits the potential applications for forgery de-\ntection and TFL. For instance, video inpainting [32] techniques can\nremove specific objects from videos, leading to fabricated evidence,\nas shown in Figure 1. Based on the above observations, we propose\nthe following work.\nFor different modalities of multimedia, we propose a novel uni-\nversal multimodal-adaptive transformer framework for TFL called\nUMMAFormer. The framework aims to predict forgery segments\nand their corresponding start and end timestamps in untrimmed\nvideos or audios. Transformer-based models [19, 26, 31, 51] have\ndemonstrated excellent performance in various tasks and can adapt\nto different modality feature inputs. Therefore, we build a universal\nmultimodal adaptive framework based on the transformer block\nthat can be used for TFL tasks involving different modalities of\ndata.\nIn order to fully utilize real samples, we design a Temporal Fea-\nture Abnormal Attention (TFAA) module based on temporal feature\nreconstruction. Our motivation is based on the observation that\ncompared to TAL which relies on spatial content to recognize spe-\ncific types of actions, TFL relies more on temporal features that\nreflect the changes caused by spatial content manipulations. The un-\nderlying difference in feature distribution between manipulated and\nreal segments can be considered a universal feature of multimedia\nmanipulation that exists across any modality of input. By incor-\nporating TFAA, our method enhances the detection of temporal\ndifferences, leading to improved TFL performance across different\ninput feature modalities.\nFor analyzing short video clips with subtle variations, Feature\nPyramid Network (FPN) [ 34] is a commonly used solution that\neffectively enhances subtle features. We further optimize FPN by\nintroducing a parallel structure and proposing a Parallel Cross-\nAttention Feature Pyramid Network (PCA-FPN). PCA-FPN signifi-\ncantly improves the performance of small manipulated segments\nlocalization.\nTo advance research further, it is critical to create a new dataset\nfor a novel scenario and providing new evaluation benchmarks for\nadvancing research in TFL tasks. We introduce a novel temporal\nvideo inpainting localization dataset called TVIL for training and\nevaluation of TFL tasks. As per our knowledge, we are the first\nones to present a TFL dataset that is tailored for video inpainting\nscenes. Our dataset is built on the YouTube-VOS 2018 [55] dataset.\nWe employ XMEM [10] to annotate segmentation masks for all\nframes in the dataset, and then use four different video inpainting\nmodels [32, 37, 57, 61] to erase objects in random time periods. We\nacquire 4453 tampered videos with annotations, divided into train-\ning, validation, and testing sets according to the same proportions\nas the original dataset.\nWe conduct extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets,\nLav-DF [6], Psynd [58], and TVIL to evaluate the effectiveness of\nour proposed method. The results demonstrate that our approach\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on these datasets, outper-\nforming the previous best results by a significant margin.\nIn summary, our contributions are:\n•We introduce UMMAFormer, a novel universal transformer\nframework for multimedia temporal forgery localization that\ncan be applied to various modalities of input.\n•We propose a TFAA module that enables the model to focus\non temporal anomalies caused by spatial content tampering.\nUMMAFormer: A Universal Multimodal-adaptive Transformer Framework for Temporal Forgery Localization MM ’23, October 29-November 3, 2023, Ottawa, ON, Canada\n•We design PCA-FPN, a parallel cross-attention feature pyra-\nmid network, to improve the recognition and localization of\nultrashort forgery segments.\n•We present TVIL, a novel temporal video inpainting local-\nization dataset, for research on TFL.\n2 RELATED WORK\n2.1 Image-Level Forgery Detection\nDetecting manipulated content, especially deepfake [30, 43], has\nbecome a critical task in multimedia forensics. Significant efforts\nhave been made to enhance image-level face forgery classifica-\ntion [7, 29, 44]. Early studies [41, 46] primarily relied on basic binary\nclassifiers built upon existing backbone networks, suitable only for\ndetecting low-quality generated images. With advancements in\ndeepfake techniques, several approaches have been proposed to\ncapture specific forgery traces. These approaches explore various\nfeatures, including noise features [9, 64], local texture characteris-\ntics [7, 63], and frequency domain anomalies [28, 44], to enhance\ndetection capabilities. Unfortunately, these approaches overlooked\nthe inclusion of temporal-level features, resulting in inconsistencies\nin discriminations for consecutive video frames due to variations in\nlighting, environmental factors, and other disturbances. As a con-\nsequence, they struggle to accurately differentiate genuine videos\nfrom forgeries and fail to identify temporal boundaries of the forg-\neries within the videos.\n2.2 Temporal-Level Forgery Detection\nTemporal-level forgery detection involves the classification of forgery\nat video or audio level and the TFL task, which is the main focus of\nthis paper. The availability of various datasets [15, 27, 66] has signif-\nicantly contributed to the advancement of temporal-level forgery\nclassification methods. Previous research has proposed different\napproaches to address this challenge. Hu et al.[ 25] presented a\ntwo-stream method, utilizing a temporal-level stream to extract\ntemporal correlation features and analyze deepfake videos. Han\net al.[20] introduced a two-stream network that uses temporal in-\nformation and learnable spatial rich model (SRM) filters to detect\nfake videos at the video level. Song et al.[47] utilized a symmetric\ntransformer to enhance discrimination consistency between frames\nfor video-level forgery classification. Additionally, Kwak et al.[28]\ndeveloped a frequency feature masking method to classify real and\nfake audio in noisy environments. However, existing temporal-level\nforgery classification approaches usually treat temporal multime-\ndia content as a cohesive entity, mainly focusing on distinguishing\nbetween real and manipulated content without verifying the au-\nthenticity of specific timestamps. To address this limitation and\nenhance the practical value of deepfake detection, the TFL task was\nintroduced. Some studies [6, 11, 21, 58] have focused on this task,\nbut there is still room for significant improvement.\n2.3 Temporal Action Localization\nThe goal of TAL is to localize the time intervals in a video when\nspecific actions take place. Existing methods [50] typically followed\na general paradigm of feature extraction, feature enhancement,\nand prediction with post-processing. During the feature extrac-\ntion stage, most TAL methods typically utilized pre-trained action\nrecognition networks [16, 24, 53] to extract visual or audio-visual\nfeatures. Given offline features, most algorithms mainly focus on\nenhancing features, by modeling action boundaries attention [8, 33]\nand relationships [3, 40, 59]. Some studies [36, 39, 48] also focused\non proposing new regression and classification heads to further\nenhance the localization performance of the model.\n3 METHODOLOGY\nIn this section, we introduce our universal multimodal-adaptive\ntransformer framework, which aims to localizing temporal forgery\nin sequential multimedia data with various modalities. We have\nconsidered three scenarios, including visual-only, audio-only, or\njoint audio-visual modalities. Of course, the proposed approach\ncan also be further extended to other types of tampered sequential\nmultimedia data.\nSequential Multimedia Data𝑋\nAudio-Visual Modality\nVisual-only Modality\nAudio-only Modality\nVisual\nBackbone\nAudio\nBackbone\nConv\nProjection\n(a) Pre-trained Feature Extractor\nF\n(b) Feature Enhancement Module\nSample-level\nClassifer𝑓𝑆\n𝑓𝐷\n𝑓𝐸\n𝑍\n𝑝𝑡\nCRATrans Block\nTFAA\nPCA-FPN\n𝑃0\n𝑃1\n𝑃2\n𝑃3\n𝑃4Forgery Localization\nClassification Head\nPost-processing\n(c) Feature Decoder\nFeature Pyramid\nSequence𝑃 0~𝑃 4\nRegression Head\nTemporal\n𝑡1,𝑠𝑓 𝑡1,𝑒𝑓\n𝑠1,𝑓\n𝑡2,𝑠𝑓 𝑡2,𝑒𝑓\n𝑠2,𝑓\n𝐹\n𝐹crat\nFigure 2: Illustration of the proposed UMMAFormer, which\nconsists of three main components: (a) a pre-trained feature\nextractor that maps the sequential multimedia data 𝑋 to\nsequential features 𝐹, (b) a feature enhancement module that\nenhances the feature representation to multi-scale modified-\nsensitive features, and (c) a feature decoder that decodes the\nfeature to localize forgeries in the data.\n3.1 Overview\nOur objective is to detect forgeries in untrimmed sequential mul-\ntimedia data 𝑋 and locate the corresponding segments. Segments\ncan be represented as 𝑆 =\n\b\n𝑡𝑛,𝑠𝑓 ,𝑡𝑛,𝑒𝑓 ,𝑠𝑛,𝑓\n\t𝑁𝑓\n𝑛=1, where 𝑁𝑓 is the\nnumber of detected modified segments, 𝑡𝑛,𝑠𝑓 , 𝑡𝑛,𝑒𝑓 , and 𝑠𝑛,𝑓 are the\nstart time, the end time, and the confidence score, respectively. To\nachieve this,𝑋 is evenly split into𝑇 segments {𝑥𝑡}𝑇\n𝑡=1, and a feature\nsequence 𝐹 ∈R𝐶×𝑇 is obtained using TSN [53] and BYOL-A [42]\nas backbone networks for visual and audio data with concatenation\nof their features. Our proposed UMMAFormer framework, shown\nin Figure 2, consists of a pre-trained feature extractor, a feature en-\nhancement module based on a transformer-based network structure\ncomposed of the proposed TFAA module and PCA-FPN, and fea-\nture decoders for localization. We build on the ActionFormer [59]\nframework for our approach, with the feature decoding module\ndirectly utilized. Our proposed structure can also be extended to\nother TFL or TAL networks with similar processes.\nMM ’23, October 29-November 3, 2023, Ottawa, ON, Canada Rui Zhang et al.\nPositional\nEncoding\nCRA\nLN\nFFN\n𝐹𝑣\nConv1d\nLeakyReLU\nInstanceNorm1d ×𝐿\n×𝐿\nConv1d\nAvg-Pool\nLinear\nSoftmax\n𝐹\nDCAE\n𝐹𝑞 𝐹𝑘\n𝐹𝑝𝑒\nLN Positional\nEncoding\n𝐹\n𝐹𝑝𝑒\nCRA\nFFN\nDCAE\n𝐹crat\n𝑓𝐸\n𝐹\nTransposeConv1d\nLeakyReLU\nInstanceNorm1d𝑓𝐷\n𝑝𝑡\n𝑓𝑆\n(a) DCAE\n(b) CRA\n𝐹𝑘\n⊺\n𝐹𝑞\n𝐹𝑣\nTFAA\nZ\n𝐷×𝑇\n𝐷×𝑇\n𝐷×𝑇\n𝐹\n𝑇×𝑇\n𝐹𝑟\nSoftmax\n𝐹𝑒𝑎\n𝐹𝑐𝑟𝑎\n𝐷×𝑇\nFigure 3: Illustration of the proposed TFAA module.\n3.2 Temporal Feature Abnormal Attention\nTo adapt to modified data from different modalities and make full\nuse of real samples, we construct a Temporal Feature Abnormal\nAttention (TFAA) module built from reconstruction learning and\nCross-Reconstruction Attention Transformer (CRATrans) block.\nThe reconstruction learning can be used to determine abnormal\nstates of multi-sensor time-series signals[62]. We believe that tem-\nporal features from different modalities can also be viewed as a type\nof multi-source data. We try to use an encoder-decoder structure\nto learn the distribution of real samples during the training phase.\nDuring the inference phase, we use an attention mechanism to\nfocus on the abnormal segments generated by feature reconstruc-\ntion, which can adapt well to the features extracted from various\nmodality data. The proposed module is shown in Figure 3.\nReconstruction Learning. To be specific, given the encod-\ning feature sequence 𝐹, we first employ a Deep Convolutional\nAutoEncoder (DCAE) as illustrated in Figure 3(a) to learn robust\nrepresentations for real samples. The DCAE consists of a convo-\nlutional encoder 𝑓𝐸 and a de-convolutional decoder 𝑓𝐷. The en-\ncoder is composed of 𝐿convolutional modules. Each convolution\nmodule contain a convolution layer followed by LeakyReLU, and\nInstance Normalization [49]. The low-dimensional representation\n𝑍 ∈R𝐶𝑧 ×𝑇\n2𝐿 and the reconsturcted features ˆ𝐹 can be formulated as\nfollows:\n\u001a𝑍 = 𝑓𝐸 (𝐹),\nˆ𝐹 = 𝑓𝐷 (𝑍). (1)\nThe 𝑓𝐸 encodes the input features into low-dimensional through\nconvolution layers with a stride of 2. 𝑍 represents the latent distri-\nbution of real samples. The 𝑓𝐷 decodes the latent low-dimensional\nrepresentation to reconstruct the feature. The decoder is composed\nof transpose convolution layer, activation layer, and normalization\nlayer.\nDuring the training, we compute the distance between input\nfeatures and reconstructed features of unmodified samples in a\nmini-batch as:\n𝐿𝑟𝑒𝑐 = 1\n𝑁𝑟\nÍ𝑁𝑟\n𝑖 ∥ˆ𝐹𝑖 −𝐹𝑖∥1, (2)\nwhere 𝑁𝑟 is the number of unmodified samples in a mini-batch, and\n∥·∥ 1 is the 𝑙1-norm. To enhance the consistency of real samples\nin the low-dimensional embedding space, we utilize a sample-level\nclassifier, denoted as 𝑓𝑆, to distinguish the category to which the\ncurrent feature sequence belongs - whether it is real or tampered.\nThe classifier 𝑓𝑆 extracts sample-level features from latent features\n𝑍 using average pooling and passes them through two fully con-\nnected layers to obtain the probability score𝑝𝑡 for the sample being\ntampered. To address the issue of imbalanced data between real and\ntampered samples, we utilize the focal loss [35] as the loss function\nduring training. The sample-level focal loss is computed as follows:\n𝐿𝑠𝑐𝑙𝑠 = −𝛼(1 −𝑝𝑡)𝛾 log(𝑝𝑡), (3)\nwhere 𝛼is weighting factor to balance positive and negative samples\nand 𝛾 is the modulating factor to balance easy and hard samples.\nCross-Reconstruction Attention Transformer. Furthermore,\nmany existing anomaly detection algorithms for time series data\nuse reconstruction error to identify abnormal segments. These al-\ngorithms set a threshold and flag any segments with reconstruction\nerror above the threshold as anomalous. However, for our task, we\nneed to consider the difference in information carried by different\ntypes of samples, which can affect the difficulty of reconstruction\nand lead to larger errors in some real samples. Additionally, ma-\nnipulated segments can be very similar to real segments, resulting\nin small differences in reconstruction. Therefore, directly using\nreconstruction error to improve our algorithm’s performance is\ndifficult.\nTo address above problem, we introduce a CRATrans module,\nas shown in Figure 3(b) . As mentioned in [59], transformer block\nwith self-attention module computes a weighted average of features\nby assigning weights proportional to the similarity score between\npairs of input features. In our case, our CRATrans block with Cross-\nReconstruction Attention (CRA) will compute similarity scores\nbetween pairs of original and reconstructed features in order to\nreplace simple reconstruction errors.\nIn detail, given the original features𝐹 ∈R𝐶×𝑇 and reconstructed\nfeatures ˆ𝐹 ∈R𝐶×𝑇, we add positional encodings [51] at these fea-\ntures to make position-sensitive feature 𝐹𝑝𝑒 and ˆ𝐹𝑝𝑒. We believe\nthat positional encodings help to enhance the attention to subtle\nchanges in temporal features. Then we transform them into a latent\nspace by using Layer Normalization (LN) [2] and learnable parame-\nter matrices\n\b\n𝑊𝑞,𝑊𝑘\n\t\n∈R𝐷×𝐶, respectively. The query 𝐹𝑞 and key\n𝐹𝑘 are calculated by\n𝐹𝑞 = 𝑊𝑞\n\u0000𝐿𝑁 \u0000𝐹𝑝𝑒\n\u0001\u0001 ,𝐹𝑘 = 𝑊𝑘\n\u0010\n𝐿𝑁\n\u0010\nˆ𝐹𝑝𝑒\n\u0011\u0011\n, (4)\nwhere\n\b\n𝐹𝑞,𝐹𝑘\n\t\n∈R𝐷×𝑇. The original-reconstructed correlation\nmatrix 𝐹𝑟 ∈R𝑇×𝑇is given by\n𝐹𝑟 = 𝐹⊤\n𝑞 𝐹𝑘, (5)\nwhich represents the similarity between the original features and\nthe reconstructed features in the temporal domain. A CRA matrix\n𝐹𝑐𝑟𝑎 is obtained by normalizing the correlation matrix𝐹𝑟, as follows:\n𝐹𝑐𝑟𝑎 = 𝑆𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥\n\u0012 𝐹𝑟√\n𝐶\n\u0013\n, (6)\nUMMAFormer: A Universal Multimodal-adaptive Transformer Framework for Temporal Forgery Localization MM ’23, October 29-November 3, 2023, Ottawa, ON, Canada\nwhere 𝑆𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥 is performed row-wise, 1√\n𝐶 is used as the scaling\nfactor. This approach can effectively avoid misjudgment or neglect\nof abnormalities between the reconstructed and original features\ndue to factors such as scale. Meanwhile, we project the feature\n𝐹𝑝𝑒 to value 𝐹𝑣 ∈R𝐷×𝑇 by using the LN and learnable parameter\nmatrix 𝑊𝑣:\n𝐹𝑣 = 𝑊𝑣\n\u0000𝐿𝑁 \u0000𝐹𝑝𝑒\n\u0001\u0001 . (7)\nIn next step, a dot-product is performed on 𝐹𝑐𝑟𝑎 and the fea-\nture 𝐹𝑣 to get the representation 𝐹𝑒𝑎 enhanced by reconstruction\nanomaly attention. We formulate the function as\n𝐹𝑒𝑎 = 𝐹𝑐𝑟𝑎𝐹𝑣, (8)\nwhere 𝐹𝑒𝑎 ∈R𝐷×𝑇. Furthermore, we actually used a Multi-head\nCross-Reconstruction Attention(MCRA) for our model, where sev-\neral CRA operations are concatenated together in parallel.\nThe output features 𝐹𝑒𝑎 are added to the original feature𝐹𝑝𝑒 and\nare normalized by the LN layer. Finally, We employ a simple fully\nconnected feed-forward network (FFN) with a residual connection\nto product the output 𝐹𝑐𝑟𝑎𝑡 of CRATrans block.\n3.3 Parallel Cross-Attention Feature Pyramid\nNetwork\nHigh-resolution feature maps are crucial for position-sensitive tasks,\nsuch as TFL, which involve numerous short video segments. A\nmulti-scale Transformer encoder was used in [59] to locate action\nsegments in video based on features maps of different resolutions.\nThis encoder utilizes a simple hierarchical multi-scale network, as\nshown in Figure 4(a). However, the limited representation capability\nof high-resolution feature maps for complex content poses a chal-\nlenge. To address this issue, [34] is commonly used to fuse features\nof different scales to improve the network’s temporal localization\nability. The scheme of FPN is shown in Figure 4(b). Despite its ef-\nfectiveness, the fusion process using a simple form of upsampling\nand downsampling followed by addition usually introduces noise\nto features of different levels, which may interfere with localization.\nThis effect is particularly pronounced for shorter segments, where\neven small localization deviations can cause a sharp change in the\ntemporal Intersection over Union (tIoU) between predicted and\ntrue values. For example, a segment of 0.5 seconds, when shifted\nby 0.1 seconds from its correct position, can result in a 20% de-\ncrease in tIoU, while for 2 seconds, the tIoU will only decrease by\n5%. Inspired by HRNet [52], we propose a Parallel Cross-Attention\nFeature Pyramid Network (PCA-FPN) to enhance high-resolution\nfeatures in such cases. The PCA-FPN is illustrated in Figure 4(c),\nand effectively addresses the problem of noise in feature fusion,\nimproving the localization performance of the network.\nThe PCA-FPN fuses features of different scales simultaneously\nthrough parallel and down-sampling branches, and improves their\ninteraction through a cross-attention (CA) mechanism, Specifically,\ngiven the input feature 𝐹𝑐𝑟𝑎𝑡 from TFAA module we can encode it\nto obtain a high-resolution feature map, denoted as𝑃𝑖𝑛\n0 ∈R𝐷𝑓 𝑝𝑛×𝑇.\nSimilar to other methods, 𝑃𝑖𝑛\n0 is downsampled by an encode mod-\nule with a factor of 2 to obtain a medium-resolution feature map\n𝑃𝑖𝑛\n1 ∈R𝐷𝑓 𝑝𝑛×𝑇\n2 . Following [59], the encoder module is a multi-\nscale transformer unit. To further enhance the representation of\nthe high-resolution feature map 𝑃𝑖𝑛\n0 , we feed these two different\nresolution feature maps𝑃𝑖𝑛\n0 and 𝑃𝑖𝑛\n1 into the CA module to enhance\ntheir features. The CA module is calculated as follows:\n𝑃𝑝𝑙\n1 = 𝐶𝐴\n\u0010\n𝑊𝑐𝑞\n\u0010\n𝐿𝑁\n\u0010\n𝑃𝑖𝑛\n0\n\u0011\u0011\n,𝑊𝑐𝑘\n\u0010\n𝐿𝑁\n\u0010\n𝑃𝑖𝑛\n1\n\u0011\u0011\n,𝑊𝑐𝑣\n\u0010\n𝐿𝑁\n\u0010\n𝑃𝑖𝑛\n1\n\u0011\u0011\u0011\n, (9)\nwhere\n𝐶𝐴(𝑄,𝐾,𝑉 )= 𝑆𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥\n \n𝑄⊤𝑔(𝐾)√︁𝐷𝑓𝑝𝑛\n!\n𝑔(𝑉), (10)\n\b\n𝑊𝑐𝑞,𝑊𝑐𝑘,𝑊𝑐𝑣\n\t\n∈R𝐷𝑓 𝑝𝑛×𝐷𝑓 𝑝𝑛 are learnable parameter matrices,\n𝑔(·)is temporal interpolation function that resamples the 𝐾 and\n𝑉, which are the inputs of CA to the same size as 𝑄, 𝑆𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥 is\nperformed row-wise, 1√𝐷𝑓 𝑝𝑛\nis used as the scaling factor and 𝑃𝑝𝑙\n1 is\nthe first level parallel high-resolution feature. Subsequently, Subse-\nquently, 𝑃𝑖𝑛\n1 used as Query 𝑄and 𝑃𝑝𝑙\n1 used as Key 𝐾and Value𝑉 to\nCA module. The output of the CA module is then passed to the multi-\nscale transformer unit for downsampling to obtain 𝑃𝑖𝑛\n2 . These pro-\ncesses preserve the feature of short segments in the high-resolution\nfeature map while enhancing the representation of features at dif-\nferent scales. By repeating these processes, we can obtain five levels\nof parallel multi-scale features\nn\n𝑃𝑝𝑙\n4 ,𝑃𝑖𝑛\n1 ,𝑃𝑖𝑛\n2 ,𝑃𝑖𝑛\n3 ,𝑃𝑖𝑛\n4\no\n. Finally, we\nfuse the five levels of features from top to bottom, similar to FPN,\nto obtain the enhanced multi-scale features 𝑃 = {𝑃0,𝑃1,𝑃2,𝑃3,𝑃4}.\n𝑃0\n𝑖𝑛\n𝑃1\n𝑖𝑛\n𝑃2\n𝑖𝑛\n𝑃3\n𝑖𝑛\n𝑃4\n𝑖𝑛 Conv1d\nConv1d\nConv1d\nConv1d\nConv1d\n𝑃4\n𝑃3\n𝑃2\n𝑃1\n𝑃0\n𝐹crat\n(a) Hierarchical Network\nConv1d\nConv1d\nConv1d\nConv1d\nConv1d\nConv1d\nConv1d\nConv1d\nConv1d\nConv1d\n𝑃4\n𝑃3\n𝑃2\n𝑃1\n𝑃0\n𝐹crat\n𝑃0𝑖𝑛\n𝑃1𝑖𝑛\n𝑃2\n𝑖𝑛\n𝑃3\n𝑖𝑛\n𝑃4\n𝑖𝑛\n𝑃0\n𝑚𝑖𝑑\n𝑃1\n𝑚𝑖𝑑\n𝑃2\n𝑚𝑖𝑑\n𝑃3\n𝑚𝑖𝑑\n𝑃4\n𝑚𝑖𝑑 (b) FPN\nConv1d\nConv1d\nConv1d\nConv1d\nConv1d\nConv1d\nConv1d\nConv1d\nConv1d\n𝑃4\n𝑃3\n𝑃2\n𝑃1\n𝑃0\n𝐹crat\nCross-attention\nCross-attention\nCross-attention\nCross-attention\nCross-attention\nCross-attention\nCross-attention\n𝑃0\n𝑖𝑛\n𝑃1𝑖𝑛\n𝑃2\n𝑖𝑛\n𝑃3\n𝑖𝑛\n𝑃4𝑖𝑛\n𝑃1\n𝑝𝑙\n𝑃0\n𝑚𝑖𝑑\n𝑃1𝑚𝑖𝑑\n𝑃2\n𝑚𝑖𝑑\n𝑃3𝑚𝑖𝑑\n𝑃4\n𝑚𝑖𝑑\n𝑃2\n𝑝𝑙\n𝑃3\n𝑝𝑙\n𝑃4\n𝑝𝑙\nConv1d\n(c) PCA-FPN\nFigure 4: Comparison of feature pyramid networks design\nin the case of 5 levels.\n3.4 Training and Inference\nThe given feature pyramid 𝑃 can be decoded into output 𝑆 =\b\n𝑡𝑛,𝑠𝑓 ,𝑡𝑛,𝑒𝑓 ,𝑠𝑛,𝑓\n\t𝑁𝑓\n𝑛=1 through classification and regression heads.\nThe final training loss for the overall model is:\n𝐿= 𝐿𝑐𝑙𝑠 +𝜆𝑟𝑒𝑔𝐿𝑟𝑒𝑔 +𝜆𝑟𝑒𝑐𝐿𝑟𝑒𝑐 +𝜆𝑠𝑐𝑙𝑠𝐿𝑠𝑐𝑙𝑠, (11)\nwhere 𝐿𝑐𝑙𝑠 and 𝐿𝑟𝑒𝑔 are losses for the classification head outputs\n\b\n𝑠𝑛,𝑓\n\t𝑁𝑓\n𝑛=1 and regression head outputs\n\b\n𝑡𝑛,𝑠𝑓 ,𝑡𝑛,𝑒𝑓\n\t𝑁𝑓\n𝑛=1, respec-\ntively. 𝐿𝑐𝑙𝑠 is binary classification loss, where the label of forgery\nsegments is set to 1 and the rest is set to 0. Other settings are di-\nrectly adopted from ActionFormer. The reconstruction loss 𝐿𝑟𝑒𝑐\nMM ’23, October 29-November 3, 2023, Ottawa, ON, Canada Rui Zhang et al.\nand sample-level focal loss 𝐿𝑠𝑐𝑙𝑠 are mentioned in section 3.2. 𝜆𝑟𝑒𝑔,\n𝜆𝑟𝑒𝑐 and 𝜆𝑠𝑐𝑙𝑠 are hyper-parameters used to balance the relation-\nship between the losses. By default, we set 𝜆𝑟𝑒𝑔 = 2, 𝜆𝑟𝑒𝑐 = 1, and\n𝜆𝑠𝑐𝑙𝑠 = 0.1.\nFor the inference stage, we applied Soft-NMS [4] to post-process\nthe results and remove a large number of redundant predictions.\n4 TEMPORAL VIDEO INPAINTING\nLOCALIZATION\nWith the rapid development of AIGC technology, highly deceptive\nvideo and audio content has been widely spread on the Internet,\nleading to potential harm caused by the spread of misleading infor-\nmation. While benchmarks for deepfake videos [15, 27, 46, 66] and\naudios [17] have emerged in recent years to address the forgery of\nfacial or speech content, these methods only cover a small portion\nof all forged content. There is a lack of relevant dataset research\nfor other harmful forgery methods. Therefore, we synthesized a\ndataset for locating video inpainting segments as a new benchmark\nfor TFL, namely TVIL. Our goal is to detect various types of inpaint-\ning forgery in sequential images or videos to defend against the\nspread of misinformation and bring new insights to the research\ncommunity.\nData Collection. The dataset is constructed based on YouTube-\nVOS 2018 [55], which contains over 4,000 online videos from YouTube.\nConsidering that YouTube is currently one of the most popular\nvideo platforms and also an important source for generating and\nspreading misleading information, we believe that generating a\nsynthesized dataset based on YouTube videos can effectively evalu-\nate the performance of TFL algorithms and prevent the spread of\nmisinformation.\nData Processing. YouTube-VOS 2018 is a semi-supervised video\nsemantic segmentation dataset that does not provide complete\nsegmentation masks required for video inpainting. Therefore, we\nutilized XMEM [10], a state-of-the-art video semantic segmentation\nalgorithm, to generate the segmentation masks. These generated\nmasks can be classified into two types: stationary masks and moving\nmasks [57], which are widely used in real-world scenarios. Station-\nary masks can be used for removing static objects, simulating the\nremoval of visible watermarks leading to copyright infringement,\nand so on. On the other hand, moving masks can be used for remov-\ning moving objects, simulating the removal of specific targets such\nas people in surveillance videos. This technology can potentially\nbe used to provide false evidence in certain situations. To better\nsimulate real-world scenarios, we randomly split the dataset into\nfive parts, where one part is used as the real sample set without any\nmanipulation. The remaining four parts are subjected to different\nvideo inpainting methods, namely STTN [ 57], FuseFormer [ 37],\nE2FGVI [32] and FGT [61], which randomly removed some frames\nof the target object. This process aimed to create more diverse\nand challenging samples to test the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod in handling complex scenarios.\nDataset Statistics. We follow the original split in YouTube-\nVOS 2018, which consisted of 3,471 video clips for training, 474 for\nvalidation and 508 for testing. The average length of video clips is\nabout 140 frames, as shown in Figure 5. The training set consists of\n3340 forgery segments, the validation set consists of 451 forgery\nsegments and the test set consisists of 463 forgery segments. In our\ntask, video clips with a duration of less than 1 second are defined\nas short clips. Compared to the Lav-DF [6] dataset, where 89.26%\nof the manipulated clips are short, our dataset has a proportion of\n99.60%, making our dataset more challenging. The distribution of\nour dataset is illustrated in Figure 6. In Appendix A.1, we provide a\nfurther comparison between the TVIL dataset and other commonly\nused multimedia forensic datasets.\n50 100 150\nFrame Length\n0\n250\n500\n750\n1000\n1250Count\n(a) train set\n50 100 150\nFrame Length\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200Count (b) validation set\n50 100 150\nFrame Length\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200Count (c) test set\nFigure 5: Distribution of video lengths.\nFuseFormer\n27.4%\nSTTN\n23.1%\nFGT\n24.4%\nE2FGVI\n25.1%\n(a) Inpainting Methods\n0\n20.5%\n1\n63.4%\n2\n16.1% (b) No. of Fake Segments\n0.000 0.025 0.050 0.075 0.100 0.125 0.150 0.175 0.200\nForgery Segments Ratio\n0\n250\n500\n750\n1000\n1250\n1500\n1750\nCount (c) Fake Segments Ratio\nFigure 6: Distribution of the TVIL datasets.

The optical flow is extracted by TV- 𝐿1 algorithm. The\nframe interval is set to 1. For audio data, we employ a pre-trained\nBYOL-A [42] pre-trained on AudioSet [18]. The dimension of the\nextracted video features is 4096, while that of the audio features is\n2048. The extracted features are interpolated to 768 in the temporal\ndimension.\nDatasets and Evaluation Metric. We evaluate our method on\nthree benchmark datasets, including Lav-DF [6] for multi-modal\ndata in face forgery scenarios, our proposed TVIL dataset for vi-\nsual modality in general scenes beyond faces, Psynd [58] for audio\nmodality data in speech scenarios. We follow the evaluation proto-\ncol in [6, 21] and report average precision (AP) and average recall\n(AR) as evaluation metrics, Following conventions, we set the tIoU\nthreshold values at {0.5,0.75,0.95}and set Average Number of pro-\nposals (AN) to {10,20,50,100}. In addition, for dataset Psynd, we\nalso provide tIoU to follow the protocol of dataset Psynd.\nUMMAFormer: A Universal Multimodal-adaptive Transformer Framework for Temporal Forgery Localization MM ’23, October 29-November 3, 2023, Ottawa, ON, Canada\nBaseline and Comparison. We use ActionFormer [59] as our\nbaseline network and reproduced it based on the official code1 with\ndefault settings on our own datasets. We extend the advanced TAL\nnetwork, DCAN [8] and TAGS [39], on the TVIL dataset, represent-\ning research efforts focused on enhancement of boundary features\nand improvement of head location, respectively. Additionally, we\ncompare our algorithm with the state-of-the-art methods on each\ndataset to quantitatively evaluate the performance of our approach.\nImplementation Details. We follow ActionFormer with minor\nmodifications as follows. Our models are trained on a single RTX\n3090 GPU with initial learning rate of 0.001. The batch size for\nLav-DF is 32, for TVIL is 16 and for Psynd is 8.\n5.2 Results for Temporal Face Forgery\nLocalization\nWe report the AP and AR performance of our method and state-\nof-the-art methods on the Lav-DF Full Set in Table 1. For the full\nset, which includes three types of attacks (audio-only modified,\nvideo-only modified, and audio-video modified), most unimodal\nmodels [11, 36, 40] that focus only on visual information struggle\nto accurately locate the tampered segments. Although multimodal\nmodels [3, 6] perform well in terms of AP at tIoU 0.5, they com-\npletely fail for the more challenging AP at tIoU 0.95. The main\nreason for this is the lack of effective feature enhancement for short\nvideo segments. Short segments are extremely sensitive to the tIoU\nmetric. ActionFormer [59] network introduces a simple hierarchical\ntransformer-based network that effectively improves both AP and\nAR. Furthermore, our method further outperforms BA-TFD[6] by\n37.36% in terms of AP at tIoU 0.95 through the proposed PCA-FPN\nand TFAA with mutilmodal features. For visual-only feature as\ninputs, our significantly improves AP at tIoU 0.95 from 0.16% to\n25.68% compare with BA-TFD. In Appendix A.2, we further present\nthe experimental results for the Lav-DF subset. In Appendix A.3, we\nprovide the forgery classification results and additional evaluation\nmetrics for the Lav-DF Full Set.\nTable 1: Performance comparison on Lav-DF Full Set.

TAGS [39] is a based\n1https://github.com/happyharrycn/actionformer_release\non a novel localization head that does not include a regression task.\nIt is worth mentioning that due to the increase in in the number of\nshort video clips, the overall performance of ActionFormer is lower\nthan that of Lav-DF. Nevertheless, our method still achieved the\nbest performance, showing the superiority of our method.\nTable 2: Comparison between our method and other state-of-\nthe-art TAL methods on TVIL.

LFSS is the\nonly work so far focused on localizing voice cloning partially faked\nEnglish speech. Due to the absence of completely real samples in the\noriginal training set of Psynd, we randomly extracted 299 unaltered\naudio segments from the original dataset as the real training sam-\nples for our proposed method. To ensure fairness, we also selected\nthe best tIoU at different thresholds as the final result, as LFSS did.\nAs shown in Table 3, our algorithm achieves better performance\nunder most conditions, especially in the landline and cellular test\nsubsets. This means that our algorithm has good robustness even\nwhen the audio is further disturbed. It is worth mentioning that the\ntest special subset contains both completely fake and completely\nreal samples. Under this condition, LFSS based on simple binary\nclassification achieves good results and outperforms our method by\n1.11%. However, for other more challenging scenarios, such as local\npartial modified segments, especially under conditions where data\nare disturbed, our proposed method performs better. This further\ndemonstrates the value of research on TFL tasks.\nTable 3: Performance comparison on Psynd in terms of tIoU.\nBold faces correspond to the top performance.\nMethods test set special test set landline cellular\nLFSS [58] 98.58 99.35 80.29 80.94\nOurs 98.70 98.24 92.04 86.57\n5.5 Ablation Studies\nWe compare the contributions of different components of our method\nfor different modalities.

On the other hand, our proposed\nPCA-FPN greatly improves the localization accuracy of the model.\nMM ’23, October 29-November 3, 2023, Ottawa, ON, Canada Rui Zhang et al.\nWe also find that PCA-FPN can be applied to localization tasks in\ndifferent modalities.\nTable 4: Comprasion with FPN.

As depicted in\nFigure 8(b), due to the difficulty in locating forged segments that\nbelong to short segments, the baseline method failed to identify\nthem, whereas our method achieved significant detection results.\n6 CONCLUSIONS\nIn this paper, we propose a noval universal multimodal-adaptive\ntransformer framework for TFL, which fosters deeper investigations\nin multimedia content security and helps prevent the misuse of\nAIGC. To solve the challenges in the task, we propose a novel\nTFAA module and PCA-FPN to enhance the feature from sequential\nmultimedia data. We also provide a new dataset called TVIL for\nTFL in a novel scenario which has been released for academic use.\nThe experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed\nframework. Especially concerning the LAV-DF dataset, compared to\nthe previous state-of-the-art method BA-TFD [6], our approach has\nshown significant performance improvements.

Table 6 summarizes the benchmark\ndatasets that have been used for research on detecting genera-\ntive content of audio and video, particularly in deepfake detection.\nWhile most of the existing datasets [66] focused on simple binary\nclassification tasks related to facial image manipulation, recent\nadvancements in deepfake detection technology resulted in the\nemergence of binary classification tasks for audio [17] and multi-\nmodal audio-visual data [27]. These datasets involve not only facial\nbut also audio information, and their emergence is indicative of the\nrapid development of deepfake detection technology. Lav-DF [6]\nand Psynd [58], two other emerging datasets for TFL, are manipu-\nlated based on semantic content, making the attacks on these types\nof videos more similar to real-world scenarios. However, research\non these datasets has remained limited to scenes related to human\nfaces and speeches, which is only a small part of the AIGC task.\nFurthermore, while there are emerging classification datasets [38]\nfor tampering detection beyond face, the quantity of these datasets\nis limited due to manual generation. To expand the scope of re-\nsearch, it is important to develop more diverse datasets for TFL\ntasks. Our datasets, similar to TFL subset of ForgeryNet [21] , uses a\nrandom approach to generate segments, which facilitates research\non TFL tasks beyond facial images and beyond binary classification\ntasks. Moreover, our generation process can be reproduced under\nlow-cost conditions. Based on our research, the dataset can further\nexpand to more diverse scenarios and promote TFL task research.\nTable 6: Quantitative comparison of TVIL to existing pop-\nular Video and Audio Forensics Datasets in recent 3 years.\nCls: Classification; SL: Spatial Localization; TFL: Temporal\nForgery Localization; V: Visual; A: Audio.\nDataset Year Tasks Modality Application Manipulated # Attacks #Real #FakeWildDeepfake [66] 2021 Cls V Face AIGC - 3,805 3,509FakeAVCeleb [27] 2021 Cls A+V Face AIGC 3 570 19,500ForgeryNet [21] 2021 SL/TFL/Cls V Face AIGC 5 99,630 121,617Lav-DF [6] 2022 TFL/Cls A+V Face AIGC 2 36,431 99,873WaveFake [17] 2021 Cls A Speech AIGC 6 18,100 104,885Psynd [58] 2022 TFL A Speech AIGC 1 30 2371VideoSham [38] 2023 Cls A+V Video Manipulation User Generated 40 413 413TVIL(Ours) 2023 TFL V Video Manipulation AIGC 4 914 3539\nA.2 More Experiments Results for LAV-DF\nSubset\nWe present the AP and AR performance of our method and state-\nof-the-art algorithms on the Lav-DF subset in Table 7. This subset\nexclusively contains manipulated videos with visual forgeries, ex-\ncluding those with audio-only modifications. The results show that\nthe single-modal algorithms in Table 7 outperform their counter-\nparts in Table 2, validating the efficacy of using visual information\nalone in this context. Notably, our method achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance with an AP@0.5 of98.83% using solely visual modality.\nDespite our method’s adaptability to different modalities, apply-\ning techniques like contrastive learning to analyze modal inconsis-\ntencies during multi-modal fusion posed challenges. Introducing\nthe audio modality in this subset, where authenticity is independent\nof audio, might lead to a decrease in overall performance. Feature\nfusion could potentially confuse critical features within this specific\nsubset, as evident from the performance drop of the multi-modal\nalgorithm AVFusion [3].\nNevertheless, our proposed method consistently outperforms\nother algorithms for both uni- and multi-modal inputs. Moreover,\nby incorporating audio features, our model achieves a substantial\n7.41% improvement in AP at tIoU 0.95, demonstrating the robustness\nand adaptability of our approach in multi-modal scenarios.\nTable 7: Performance comparison on Lav-DF Sub Set.

The evaluation metric used is the\nArea Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC), and\nthe results are summarized in Table 8. In our approach, we utilize\nthe scores obtained from detected forgery timestamps as the classi-\nfication scores for the respective videos. As observed, frame-based\nalgorithms such as 𝐹3-Net [44] exhibit significant performance\ndegradation in classifying partially manipulated videos due to their\nlack of consideration of temporal factors, leading to substantial dis-\ncrepancies in discriminating between different frames. On the other\nhand, video-level algorithms such as EfficientViT [12] demonstrated\nrelatively effective recognition of deepfake videos with partially\nmanipulated segments, but are unable to provide corresponding\ntimestamps for the forgeries. In contrast, our method achieved the\nbest classification performance while also providing corresponding\nforgery timestamps. Additionally, our temporal forgery localization\nperformance significantly outperforms MDS [11] and BA-TFD [6].\nIt is worth noting that our model was not specifically designed for\nthe classification task, and further performance improvement could\nbe achieved by introducing a dedicated classification head.\nTable 8: Deepfake detection results on the Lav-DF dataset.\nBold faces correspond to the top performance\nMethods AUC\n𝐹3-Net [44] 52.0\nMDS [11] 82.8\nEfficientViT [12] 96.5\nBA-TFD [6] 99.0\nOurs 99.8",
