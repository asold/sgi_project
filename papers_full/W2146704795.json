    "abstract": "Sensors based on the giant magnetoimpedance (GMI) effect in silicon steelswere constructed. Strips of silicon steels (0.500 mm-thick, 35.0 mm-long) with widthsranging from 0.122 to 1.064 mm were cut from recycled transformer cores. Since amaximum GMI ratio of 300% and a maximum field sensitivity of 1.5%/Oe were observedin a 1.064 mm-wide sample at 200 kHz, the 1.064 mm-wide strips were chosen as sensingelements in a slot key switch, angular velocity sensor, current sensor and force sensor. Thesensing elements were integrated into electronic circuits and the changes in impedancewere monitored. Variations in voltage due to these changes were typically small and musttherefore be amplified by the electronic circuits. For the current sensor and force sensor,the variation in the voltage drop across the GMI sensing element had non-linear variationswith either current or force and a conversion formula from a computer program wastherefore needed. The performance of the systems was tested. These sensing systems werestable, highly sensitive, hysteresis-free and could be produced on a mass scale. Based ontheir GMI effect, the silicon steels are versatile alternative low-cost sensors.",
