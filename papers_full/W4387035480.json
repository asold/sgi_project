  "abstract": "This paper explores the integration of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, in chemical engineering education, departing from conventional practices that may not be universally accepted. While there is ongoing debate surrounding the acceptance of LLMs, driven by concerns over computational instability and potential inconsistencies, their inevitability in shaping our communication and interaction with technology cannot be ignored. As educators, we are positioned to play a vital role in guiding students toward the responsible, effective, and synergetic use of LLMs. Focusing specifically on distillation column design in undergraduate mass-transfer courses, this study demonstrates how ChatGPT can be utilized as an auxiliary tool to create interactive learning environments and simulate real-world engineering thinking processes. It emphasizes the need for students to develop critical thinking skills and a thorough understanding of LLM principles, taking responsibility for their use and creations. While ChatGPT should not be solely relied upon, its integration with fundamental principles of chemical engineering is crucial. The effectiveness and limitations of ChatGPT are exemplified through two case studies, showcasing the importance of manual calculations and established simulation software as primary tools for guiding and validating engineering results and analyses. This paper also addresses the pedagogical implications of integrating LLMs into mass transfer courses, encompassing curriculum integration, facilitation, guidance, and ethical considerations. Recommendations are provided for incorporating LLMs effectively into the curriculum. Overall, this study contributes to the advancement of chemical engineering education by examining the benefits and limitations of LLMs as educational aids in the design process.",
