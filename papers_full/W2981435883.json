INTRODUCTION\nFuture development of High V oltage (HV) systems and smart\ngrid revolution demanded a reliable and efﬁcient insulating\nmaterial with volatile and dynamic operating conditions [1].\nThe transformer used in the electrical system transforms volt-\nage, current, and transfer energy; therefore, a potential failure\nof the transformer is destructive [2]. Most of the transformers\nin the power system (currently in use) are closer to or beyond\nthe classical structure. The available statistics of transformer\nfailure reveals that the average transformer’s operation failed\ndue to insulation breakdown in ‘17.8’years [3]. The ability of\na transformer to conduct heat describes its thermal conductiv-\nity. Mineral oil used in the transformer performs the primary\nfunction of insulation and heat transfer. Thermal conductivity\nis an important parameter considered in improving the heat\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Jenny Mahoney.\ntransfer characteristics of the transformer. There is a pressing\nneed to work with the ﬂuid with higher thermal conductivity\nfor transformer oil. Degradation of insulating mineral oil\nresults because of heat and electrical discharge. Insulation\nand cooling features of mineral oil are reduced due to accel-\nerated aging. Moreover, the addition of impurities and water\nparticles in mineral oil form oxides and acidic products due\nto continuous usage, thus, reducing the breakdown strength\nof the transformer oil.\nRecently, Nano-Particles (NPs) are added in transformer\noil to improve the breakdown strength, insulation level, and\nage of transformer oil. Nano-sized particles are immersed\nin mineral oil; the smaller size of NPs subsequently leads\nto the increased interfacial area and ensures a larger zone\nof interaction between mineral oil and the NPs. Trans-\nformer oil-immersed with NPs is referred to as Nano-Fluid\n(NF). NPs not only improve the dielectric strength of oil\nbut also the heat transfer characteristics of the mineral oil.\nVOLUME 7, 2019 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Abidet al.: Dielectric and Thermal Performance Up-Gradation of Transformer Oil Using Valuable Nano-Particles\nSuspension stability is also improved in the case of NPs due\nto increased surface area, compared to conventionally used\nmicro-sized particles [3].\nThe authors in [2] examined the AC breakdown strength\nof different NPs and concluded that the NPs enhanced the\nproperties of base oil and performed better even at elevated\ntemperatures. In [3], the authors found that the addition of\nAluminum Nitride NPs in transformer oil increased partial\ndischarge inception voltage up to 20%, compared to virgin\ntransformer oil. Results further depicted a 3-7% increase in\nthe thermal conductivity of the transformer oil. Transformer\noil was modiﬁed by adding semiconducting NPs. Lightning\nand AC breakdown tests were carried out before and after\nmodifying the transformer oil. Results revealed that the AC\nbreakdown strength of NF was almost 1.26 times the base\noil breakdown strength, while lightning breakdown voltage\nincreased by almost 24% to that of base oil [4]. The authors\nin [5] reviewed the breakdown properties of transformer oil\nwith NPs and concluded that the addition of nanoparticles in\ntransformer oil improved the breakdown strength of the oil to\nlarge extent, compared to the virgin transformer oil. In [6],\nthe authors analyzed AC breakdown strength of TiO 2 NFs\nwith different concentrations (0.003g/L to 0.05g/L) of NPs\nand concluded that optimum results were achieved when the\nconcentration of 0.01 g/L was used. AC breakdown strength\nincreased with an increase in concentration up to a speciﬁed\noptimum concentration after that a notable decrease was\nobserved mainly due to the agglomeration of NPs inside the\nﬂuid.\nThe authors in [7] investigated the AC breakdown strength\nof Fe 2O3 with different concentrations (5% to 80% volume\nconcentrations) of NPs. AC breakdown strength increased\nwith an increase in concentrations but optimum results were\nobtained at 40% concentration. In [8]–[10], Titanium Oxide\n(TiO2) NPs were added in transformer oil, compared with\nsome suitable surfactants. AC breakdown strength of the\noil showed an increase of about 27% in comparison to the\nbase oil. AC breakdown strength and viscosity tests were\nperformed on transformer oil containing SiO 2 NPs. Results\nshowed a signiﬁcant improvement of about 79% and revealed\nthat the mass concentrations were unable to impose any\neffect on viscosity. Breakdown strength depends largely on\nthe moisture content and decreases signiﬁcantly with an\nincrease in water content. Hydrophilic surface of SiO 2 NPs\nbinds water on the surface, leading to minimum water, hence\nincreasing the breakdown strength [11].\nSemi-conductive TiO 2 NPs were added to mineral oil to\nimprove its insulation characteristics. The volume concentra-\ntion of NPs used was 0.075% of the base oil and the average\nparticle size was less than 20nm. AC, partial discharge and\nlightning impulse breakdown voltage characteristics were\nmeasured for the mineral oil before and after modiﬁcation\nwith NPs. Results showed that the AC and lightning break-\ndown strength improved by almost 1.2 times due to the addi-\ntion of NPs. The partial discharge also showed a signiﬁcant\nincrease with the addition of NPs and the improvement in\nresults was contributed by the electron trapping property of\nthe NPs [12]. In [13], the authors explained the effect of NPs\non aging and breakdown of vegetable oil that is considered an\nalternative insulation medium to transformer oil. The authors\nin [14] investigated the AC dielectric strength of different\ncolloids with varying particle mass fraction. TiO 2 NPs modi-\nﬁed by different organic reagents were suspended in the base\noil via the ultrasonic route. The suspensions were made by\nmixing TiO2, silicon oil-treated TiO 2, and octadecanoic acid-\ntreated TiO2 NPs with transformer oil. The concentration of\nNPs was kept in the range of 0.003 to 0.005 g/ml and resulted\nin improved BV at optimum composition. Three types of\nNPs, namely conductive (Fe 2O3), semi-conductive (TiO 2),\nand non-conductive (Al 2O3) NPs were used to improve the\nBV of mineral oil. Different concentrations of NPs were used\nto check the impact of volume on the mineral oil breakdown\nstrength. Results also revealed that the BV increased by\nincreasing the concentration of NPs up to a speciﬁc concen-\ntration, after that the breakdown voltage decreased further.\nThis may be contributed to the agglomeration of particles due\nto increased volume [15].\nDespite extensive use of NPs in transformer oil to improve\nthermal and dielectric properties, the researchers failed to\npresent a complete model set of tests to be carried out on\nNFs and to use NFs as an alternative to existing mineral oil.\nAC dielectric strength of NFs was measured in the past but\nother thermal and dielectric properties were not considered.\nThe loss factor is one of the key parameters to account for\nthe health of mineral oil was also not considered in the\navailable literature. Other thermal properties like ﬂash point\nand pour point that describes the behavior of oil at very\nlow and high temperatures were not checked along with the\nbreakdown voltage. Increased water content is the reason\nfor the low dielectric strength of the oil that lacks in the\nprevious work. Aging of the NFs being an important test to be\nperformed was missing in the previous work. Aging gives the\nlife expectancy of the oil. Detailed thermal properties of the\nNFs were unavailable in existing literature. Thermal property\nis considered important in deﬁning the thermal conductivity\nof oil for cooling inside the transformer. Thermal aging was\nperformed on a few NFs, while multi-aging (electrical and\nthermal) was not incorporated on NP additives.\nIn the light of above-mentioned issues, the primary objec-\ntives of this research are listed as:\n• The selection of suitable NPs is accomplished by com-\nparing the thermal and dielectric properties of the NPs\nincluding permittivity and measurement of electrical\nconductivity of the oil.\n• The loss factor, as well as water content, is measured\nfor the oil samples. Thermal properties namely viscosity,\nﬂash point and pour point are also analyzed that provide\ninformation about the oil performance under very low\nand high temperatures.\n• Multi-aging is performed by applying thermal and elec-\ntrical stresses at the same time for a period of 1000 hours\napproximating the age of NFs.\n153510 VOLUME 7, 2019\nM. A. Abidet al.: Dielectric and Thermal Performance Up-Gradation of Transformer Oil Using Valuable Nano-Particles\nThe rest of our paper is organized as follows: Section II\ndescribes the preparation of NFs and the aging apparatus.\nThe detailed aging process of NFs is provided in Section III,\nSection IV presents the performance validation of the tests\ncarried out on the oil samples. Critical analysis with recent\nState-of-the-Art work is presented in Section V . Section VI\npresents conclusions and future work.\nII. NFs PREPARATION\nTransformer oil was modiﬁed by adding NPs. Generally,\nthere are two methods to prepare the NFs. The efﬁcient\nand most broadly employed method is the two-step method.\nIn this method, NPs prepared (either by chemical or physical\nmethods) are suspended in the oil. Ultrasonic route and mag-\nnetic stirring mixing methods are used to fully prepare the\nNFs. Magnetic stirrer uses a rotating magnetic ﬁeld to make\na homogenous mixture. Application of external magnetic\nﬁeld to magnetic stirrers assists in mixing the solution that\nfacilitates the rotation of small magnetic bars placed in a\nmixture of interest. Therefore, the rapidly rotating magnetic\nﬁeld results in the rotation of the bar magnet that ends up\nstirring the liquid. During this method, NPs are directly mixed\nwith the carrier ﬂuid and then the process of ultra-sonication\nis employed to ﬁnally prepare the NFs. Ultra-sonication is a\nmechanical technology used for sludge disintegration. Soni-\ncation agitates particles in a solution using sound waves. Son-\nication converts an electrical signal into a physical vibration\nto break substances apart. These disruptions can (a) accelerate\nthe dissolution of a solid into a liquid, (b) mix solutions,\nand (c) remove dissolved gases from liquids. Periodical com-\npression and rarefaction incur as a result of ultrasound waves\npropagation through the medium. Microbubbles are formed\ndue to ultrasound waves propagation in the medium. The\nmicrobubbles violently collapse within a few microseconds\nafter reaching a critical size and induce the occurrence of\ncavitation. The violent collapse of microbubbles leads to\nextreme conditions.\nThermal characterization of the NPs is carried out by con-\nducting a test at room temperature (273K), 343K, 353K, and\n363K separately and for 5 times at each temperature with\na time interval gap of 4 minutes. The selection of suitable\nNPs to enhance dielectric and thermal properties is a difﬁ-\ncult process, as the basic properties like electrical permittiv-\nity and conductivity affect the dielectric performance of oil\nsigniﬁcantly. Considering electrical stress, the NP exhibits\nan electron scavenging mechanism converting fast electrons\ninto slow negatively charged particles in the insulating ﬂuid.\nBased on conductivity, relaxation time constant, and electron\nscavenging, the NPs are generally classiﬁed into three types,\nnamely semi-conductive, conductive, and magnetic NPs. The\nmechanisms exerted by the NPs are listed in Table 1.\nThree samples each of Nickel Oxide, Titanium Oxide,\nAluminum Oxide, and Zinc Oxide NPs were prepared by\nadding 0.05g/L in virgin transformer oil. The average size of\nthe NPs used was about 20nm. These NFs along mineral oil\nwere aged both thermally and electrically. The temperature\nTABLE 1. Mechanism of NPs.\nused for thermal aging was 100 oC and a voltage of 1kV was\napplied to age the samples electrically. Samples were aged for\na time period of 2 months.\nIII. AGING PROCESS\nThe NF samples along virgin mineral oil are kept inside the\naging chamber for accelerated aging. The aging period of the\nsamples is 2 months. Multi-aging is performed on all the oil\nsamples. The multi-aging term means that both electrical and\nthermal stresses are applied to the oil samples. Thermal aging\nand electrical aging are performed on the samples to check the\nlevel of deterioration of oil properties. The aging chamber has\nthe dimensions of 5 × 3 × 2 cubic feet. Bus bars are placed\ninside the chamber; the upper bar is connected to high voltage\nlive wire while the lower bar is connected with neutral to\napply electrical stresses. Heating rods are hanged inside the\nchamber for providing thermal stresses as shown in Figure 1.\nFIGURE 1. Aging chamber.\nTemperature sensors continuously monitor the temperature\nof the chamber and are shown on the display unit. Heating\nrods are turned ON as the temperature falls below the setpoint\nand are turned OFF automatically as the temperature reaches\nthe set point. The voltage applied to the samples is 1kV\nwhile the temperature used is 100 oC for a period of 7 weeks.\nAs in reality, mineral oil in the transformer is subjected\nto high voltages and currents, so the electrical stresses are\napplied to provide these conditions. During the operation, the\ntransformer gets heated due to the heating effect of current\nVOLUME 7, 2019 153511\nM. A. Abidet al.: Dielectric and Thermal Performance Up-Gradation of Transformer Oil Using Valuable Nano-Particles\nand other power losses, so to provide the condition of higher\ntemperature, thermal stresses are applied [16].\nThree samples of each NF and virgin transformer oil are\naged inside the aging chamber. Accelerated aging on oil\nsample is carried out to predict the life of the oil. In the\naccelerated aging process, intense conditions of electrical and\nthermal stresses are applied, compared to the stresses that\noil undergoes during service life. These stresses are applied\ncontinuously for a longer period of time on transformer oil to\ncheck whether the oil can withstand those stresses in actual\nservice life or not.\nIV. PERFORMANCE VALIDATION\nAC breakdown strength is the foremost property that needs to\nbe checked for a liquid used as mineral oil. Water content and\nloss factor (tan delta) tests are important in determining the\ndielectric properties of the NFs. Other tests that are necessary\nto perform for examining the thermal properties of the oil are\nﬂash point and pour point. To check the physical condition\nof the oil, a viscosity test is performed to check its suitability\nof usage as a cooling liquid inside the transformer. All the\nmentioned tests are carried out on the oil samples before\nthe thermal and electrical aging of the samples. BV test is\nperformed at the HV Lab of COMSATS University Abbot-\ntabad. Other mentioned tests are carried out at Rawat HV\nLaboratories, Islamabad.\nFIGURE 2. Flash point measurement equipment.\nEquipment used to carry out tests for checking thermal\nand dielectric properties is shown in Figure 2 to Figure 7.\nFigure 2 represents the ﬂash point measurement equipment.\nTan delta is measured via equipment shown in Figure 3.\nFigure 4 shows the viscosity measurement equipment. Pour\npoint is measured by the equipment shown in Figure 5.\nFigure 6 shows the measurement equipment of water con-\ntent. Dissipation Factor is measured by equipment shown in\nFigure 7. The aforementioned tests were carried out before\nFIGURE 3. Tan delta measurement equipment.\nFIGURE 4.

Results were\ncompared to virgin mineral oil and the recommended level\n(IEC 60296) of values for transformer oil. The oil sample\npasses the required test if acquired values lie within the\nstandard limits.\nA. TEST CASES\nThe aforementioned tests were performed to ensure that the\nsample NF can be considered as the possible replacement\nof mineral oil. A complete set of tests were performed on\na sample for it to be suitable for consideration if the values\nof the result lie within the limits prescribed by the standard.\nImproved results show that the sample NF can be used as\n153512 VOLUME 7, 2019\nM.

Water content measurement Equipment.\ntransformer oil. Aging is also an important factor to be con-\nsidered to predict the life of the NFs. All these tests are\nnecessary to conduct on oil samples before and after the aging\nof samples.\n1) BREAKDOWN VOLTAGE (BV)\nAC breakdown refers to the value of AC voltage that initiates\ndisruption discharge in the liquid. The BV test is carried\nout by exposing the insulating mineral oil to the electric\nﬁeld applied between two electrodes dipped in the oil. The\nbreakdown voltage of a liquid is actually the measure of its\nability to withstand voltage stresses [17]–[19]. An oil testing\ncup weighing 0.5kg and having dimensions of 140 × 100 ×\n110 mm is used for BV measurement. Two movable spherical\nbrass electrodes are ﬁtted inside the oil testing cup. The\nseparation between electrodes is kept 2.5mm and the volume\nof oil used is 300ml to completely dip the electrodes inside\nthe oil. An applied voltage across electrodes is increased at\nthe rate of 2kV/sec. This test helps in insulation properties\nFIGURE 7. Dissipation factor measurement equipment.\nTABLE 2. Comparatively analysis of BV.\ncharacterization of the NPs also known as the Partial Dis-\ncharge Inception V oltage (PDIV) test. Table 2 provides BV\ntest results performed before and after the aging of the NFs.\nAmong all the NPs, breakdown voltage for ZnO is the highest\nwith less standard deviation. ZnO does not allow the streamer\nto accumulate and spreads the electric ﬁeld developed. There\nis a signiﬁcant 34.6% increase in the breakdown, compared\nto the virgin transformer oil. After the aging of oil samples,\nthe BV decreased due to the addition of contamination and\nformation of oxides inside the oil that resulted in the early\nbreakdown of the oil sample. It is visible from Table 2 that\nafter aging, the BV for ZnO is the highest among all the oil\nsamples and still very much above the recommended level.\nHigher the breakdown voltage, better is the NF.\nNPs when added in the oil improve breakdown strength\nconsiderably as depicted in Figure 8. BV for ZnO NPs is\ngreater among all other NFs. This is attributed to the fact\nthat ZnO does not allow the electric ﬁeld to accumulate.\nZnO NPs disperse the developed electric ﬁeld resulting in\nhigher breakdown voltage. Figure 8 shows that the breakdown\nvoltage of aged oil samples decreased but is still within\nthe recommended level. The decrease in the breakdown\nstrength after aging is due to the addition of contaminants\nVOLUME 7, 2019 153513\nM. A. Abidet al.: Dielectric and Thermal Performance Up-Gradation of Transformer Oil Using Valuable Nano-Particles\nFIGURE 8. Comparison of BV.\nand moisture in the oil. ZnO based NFs resulted in the\nhighest BV among all the oil samples. ZnO NPs being con-\nductive have very short relaxation time as compared to the\nstreamer development time scale in mineral oil. So, these\nNPs get briskly polarized after the application of the electric\nﬁeld, converting high mobility electrons into slow negative\ncharge carriers. Growth of net space charge at the streamer\ntip is delayed due to the slow-moving charges restraining\nstreamer propagation in the oil resulting in higher breakdown\nperformance.\n2) WATER CONTENT (WC)\nWC in an insulator is the measure of water particles/droplets\npresent inside a liquid. WC is an important property that\naffects the breakdown of a liquid. Breakdown strength is\nreduced due to the presence of water particles. As mineral oil\nis an insulating material, the presence of WC reduces break-\ndown strength [4]. Megger KF875 is used for the measure-\nment of WC. Table 3 describes the trend of WC in different\nNFs and mineral oil. Moreover, values of WC before and after\naccelerated aging were compared. WC usually increases after\nacceleration due to the production of oxides, so an increasing\ntrend was observed in WC values after the aging of oil sam-\nples. WC content for all the NFs was within the prescribed\nlimit of the recommended level. Further, comparing the water\ncontents of mineral oil and other NFs revealed that ZnO\nbased NF resulted in the lowest water content. ZnO NF also\nshowed a minimal increase in WC even after aging. ZnO\nbeing inert towards oxidation reaction produces a smaller\nnumber of water particles as depicted from the values of ZnO\nNF in Table 3.\nTable 3 concludes that the water content of the NF samples\nreduces due to the reason that NPs absorb moisture due to\nthe large surface area. Moisture content in the case of ZnO\nwas low, which is in compliment with breakdown values\nin Table 2. Figure 9 provides the graphical representation of\nthe results showing that water content is less than the required\nvalue even after the aging of the samples. The water content\nincreased after aging as contaminants and water particles\nwere added due to accelerated aging.\nTABLE 3. Comparative study of water content.\nFIGURE 9. Comparison of water content.\n3) TAN DELTA\nTan delta also known as the dissipation factor is the measure\nof insulation level. Tan delta (TD) provides details about\nthe loss of insulation after the accelerated aging of the oil\nsamples. Megger Foster OTS 100F/2 providing 100kV testing\nvoltage is employed to measure TD. Table 4 depicts that the\nvalues of loss factor are within the standard limits for every oil\nsample. Less the value of TD, better is the dielectric strength\nof oil, this is true for ZnO based NFs that provided minimum\nvalue for TD even after accelerated aging of the oil samples.\nThis is mainly due to the fact that fewer oxides are formed\nand low WC after aging in ZnO accounts for the minimum\nloss in insulation property of the oil. Among other proposed\nNFs, ZnO provides the lowest loss factor.\nTABLE 4. Tan delta comparison.\nThe values of TD for all the oils are less than the recom-\nmended level as shown in Figure 10. TD also measures the\n153514 VOLUME 7, 2019\nM. A. Abidet al.: Dielectric and Thermal Performance Up-Gradation of Transformer Oil Using Valuable Nano-Particles\nFIGURE 10. Comparison of tan delta.\nloss of insulation level after oil aging. After aging, the values\nof TD increased due to the addition of contaminants and\nmoisture by continuous usage and aging of the oil. The mini-\nmum value of TD for ZnO indicates the high insulation level\nand less deterioration of ZnO.\n4) VISCOSITY\nViscosity is the property of the oil that gives information\nabout the resistance to the ﬂow of liquid and considers the\nlaminar ﬂow of the liquid. Mineral oil in the transformer must\nhave minimum viscosity to ﬂow easily. Mineral oil performs\ntwo basic functions in the transformer, namely insulation and\ncooling of the transformer. As cooling inside a transformer is\nachieved through the conventional ﬂow of mineral oil, there-\nfore oil should have very low viscosity to ﬂow easily without\nany hindrance. If the mineral oil has low viscosity only then\nthe function of cooling could be performed efﬁciently [23].\nKV6 viscometer bath is used to measure viscosity. In Table 5,\nthe viscosity measurement of various oil samples shows that\nZnO provided the lowest viscosity among the oil samples\nwith a minimum increase in viscosity after aging. This is\nmainly due to the large surface area of the NPs.\nTABLE 5. Viscosity comparison.\nThe addition of NPs accounts for the increase in viscosity\nas shown in Figure 11. The viscosity of ZnO NPs was lower\nand within the recommended level before aging. The viscos-\nity of the oils increased after aging due to the addition of\ncontaminants in the oil. The viscosity of other oil samples was\nFIGURE 11. Comparison of viscosity.\nmore than the recommended level while in the case of ZnO,\nviscosity was slightly higher than the recommended level.\n5) FLASH POINT\nFlash point is a temperature at which vapors of a liquid\nignite. Flash occurs due to an increase in temperature inside\nthe transformer tank. When the temperature rises above\nthe prescribed limit, liquid inside the transformer tank can\nhave ﬂashover. Flash point is used to categorize a liquid\nas ﬂammable or inﬂammable. Tanaka APM-7 Automated\nPensky-Martens Closed Cup ﬂash point tester measures the\nﬂash point. Inside the equipment, oil is heated using a gas\nor electric heater. Flash point temperature is measured after\na few minutes and is shown on the VFD (Variable Frequency\nDrive) module. Table 6 shows that the value of the ﬂash point\nwas very much above the standard value for all the oil samples\nbecause these NPs have high thermal conductivity. Among all\nthe NFs, ZnO possessed the highest ﬂash point after the aging\nof the oil samples.\nTABLE 6. Flash point comparison.\nFlash point, if sustained for a longer time, the oil catches\nﬁre and results in hazardous circumstances. Figure 12 depicts\nthat the addition of NPs enhances the thermal properties of\nthe oil. NPs have a small size and large surface area that\nhelps in the conduction of heat. The ﬂash point of the oil\nwas higher than the recommended value. The value of ﬂash\npoints decreased after the aging of the oil but was still higher\nthan the recommended value. ZnO has the highest value of\nﬂash point due to the fact that ZnO NPs have the highest\nthermal conductivity, contrarily, Al2O3 gave the lowest value\nof ﬂash point among all the proposed NPs but still the value\nVOLUME 7, 2019 153515\nM. A. Abidet al.: Dielectric and Thermal Performance Up-Gradation of Transformer Oil Using Valuable Nano-Particles\nFIGURE 12. Comparison of flash point.\nof ﬂash point was higher than the recommended level even\nafter accelerated aging of oil.\n6) POUR POINT TEMPERATURE\nThe liquid loses its ﬂow properties and becomes semi-solid\nat the lowest temperature termed as pour point. It is due to\nthe presence of high parafﬁn content present in the liquid.\nParafﬁn content is in higher quantity in crude oil or the\noils extracted from it, similar to mineral oil used in the\ntransformer. If the pour point of the liquid is low, it is not\na good property for oil to have, as with a small decrease in\ntemperature it turns into solid-state. Viscosity increases at\nlow temperatures offering more resistance to ﬂow reducing\nthe cooling efﬁciency of the oil [10]. Table 7 concluded that\nthe pour point of all oil samples was close to the standard.\nAlthough PP increases from the standard value after aging\nthat is not a big concern as these temperatures are not attain-\nable in most parts of the world. Except for the TiO 2 NF\nsample, every sample had a pour point nearly equal to the\nstandard value.\nTABLE 7. Pour point comparative analysis.\nPour point is the property to be considered for transformers\noperating in freezing temperature regions. Pour point needs\nto have a minimum value as possible. Figure 13 shows that\noils with Nickel and Zinc oxide NPs provided minimum pour\nFIGURE 13. Comparison of pour point.\npoint due to the fact that they absorb heat as these NFs possess\nvery good thermal properties.\nV. CRITICAL ANALYSIS WITH RECENT\nSTATE-OF-THE-ART WORK\nIn Table 8, our work is compared with recent state-of-art\nworks related to the addition of NPs in mineral oil and the\nchange in properties observed due to NP addition. After the\npreparation of NFs, dielectric and thermal properties were\nchecked and compared with the recent work. ZnO based NFs\nwere examined by checking the BV , viscosity, and pour point\nof the NF, and performed aging by applying thermal stresses\nin [6]. Moreover, the need for other tests to be performed on\nNF samples arises. In [7], TiO 2 NPs were tested only for BV\nand WC after applying electrical stresses during the aging\nof the NFs, leaving room for more tests to perform to make\nthese NFs viable for the replacement of mineral oil. In [10],\nthe investigation was carried out on Fe 2O3 and TiO 2 NPs.\nBV and the acidity tests were performed. This showed that\na complete set of tests were not performed on the NFs, for\nwhich further tests are still needed to be performed. In the\ncase of [16], SiO 2 NPs were added to mineral oil to observe\nany change in the dielectric and thermal properties of the NF.\nThe primary test performed was the BV test to check the\ndielectric strength of the oil. To check the physical property\nof the oil, viscosity was measured along the pour point test to\ncheck the thermal property of the NF.\nThe authors in [20] used other types of NPs, NiO 2, to put\nforward as the possible replacement to mineral oil after form-\ning NFs. The research still lacked with tests like WC and\nacidity and electrical stresses were missing during the aging\nof NF samples. In the case of [21], insulative NPs, Al 2O3 was\nused to prepare NFs and was tested for a better number of\ntests, but still lacked the important tests like the loss factor,\npour point, and WC. In [22], Al 2O3 NPs were used along\n153516 VOLUME 7, 2019\nM. A. Abidet al.: Dielectric and Thermal Performance Up-Gradation of Transformer Oil Using Valuable Nano-Particles\nTABLE 8. Comparison of our work with recent research papers.\nTiO2 to prepare the NFs that were tested for the BV and\ntan delta to check dielectric properties. WC test was used to\ndetermine the insulation property whereas to check chemical\nproperties, acidity test was performed. Moreover, electrical\nstresses were applied to perform the aging of the NF samples.\nOur samples included three different NPs that were used in\nspeciﬁc proportions to make NFs. Every test required for the\nNF to pass for capable of replacing mineral oil was performed\nexcept for the acidity test as provided in Table 8. The ‘\u0013’\nshows the presence of the test concluded in the selected study,\nwhile ‘\u0018’ shows the absence of the test in the referred study.\nVI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\nIn this paper, dielectric and thermal characteristics of conduc-\ntive (ZnO), insulative (Al 2O3), and semi conductive (TiO 2)\nwere investigated after carrying out a set of experiments. The\naddition of NPs enhanced the dielectric and thermal proper-\nties of the oil. Among the three NFs, ZnO and TiO 2 exhibit\nsuperior characteristics, but conductive NPs have the draw-\nback of agglomeration. In the case of semi-conductive NPs,\nthere was a decrease in the distortion of modiﬁed mineral\noil due to the introduction of shallow traps that trapped high\nmobility electrons. Hence, increasing the dielectric strength\nof the NF as a smaller number of the electron was left to\ncontribute towards streamer development. ZnO NFs showed\nbetter dielectric and thermal properties, compared to other\nNFs and mineral oil. ZnO NPs showed higher breakdown\nstrength than other NPs and virgin mineral oil due to its\nability to disperse the streamer and avoid an early breakdown\nto occur. The inert behavior of ZnO NPs accounts for the\nproduction of fewer oxides, preventing ZnO from having\nhigher WC and viscosity and keeping the dielectric character-\nistics intact. The minimum value of tan delta or loss factor in\nthe case of ZnO based NFs after accelerated aging concluded\nthat ZnO NFs can be used as an alternative to mineral oil due\nto their superior thermal and dielectric properties.\nIn the future, NP composites will be tested for dielectric\nand thermal characteristics to ﬁnd an even better composition\nfor the replacement in transformer oil.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to thank COMSATS University Islam-\nabad, Abbottabad Campus, for providing the HV Lab Facility\nduring all experimentation work.
