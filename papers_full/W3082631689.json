Various\npioneering approaches [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] have been proposed to boost the performance of visual question answering (VQA)\n[6], image captioning, image-text matching, visual reasoning [7] and textual grounding, respectively. These models\nlearned image representations from powerful backbone convolutional neural networks (CNN), text representations from\nrecurrent neural networks (RNN), and a fusion modality to achieve joint image-text embedding. For simplicity, these\ngenres of models are often referred to as CNN+RNN models. Most of these models were designed for speciﬁc vision-\nan-language tasks and therefore had relatively poor generalizability. Recently, inspired by the success of large-scale\npre-trained language models, such as BERT [8], XLNET [9], more researchers focus on generating image-text join\nembedding from pre-training Transformer-based [10] model on V+L datasets. The joint embedding is then ﬁne-tuned to\nvarious V+L tasks and achieves state-of-the-art results. The main difference between these models lies in pre-training\nstrategies and cross-modality architecture. To be speciﬁc, UNITER [11] and VisualBert [12] applied a single stream of\nTransformer to jointly learn image-text embedding. LXMERT [13] and ViLBERT [14] used two separated Transformer\nblocks on image and text input and a third fusion Transformer block for cross-modality. Masked language modeling,\n∗Corresponding author\nOur implementation can be found at: https://github.com/YIKUAN8/Transformers-VQA\narXiv:2009.01523v1  [cs.CV]  3 Sep 2020\nA PREPRINT - SEPTEMBER 4, 2020\nmasked region modeling, image-text matching, word-region alignment, and other pre-training tasks are experimented in\nthose models.\nThe joint image-text embedding are less discussed in the biomedical domain due to the shortage of large-scale annotated\nV+L datasets. TandemNet [15], which adopts a CNN+LSTM architecture, classiﬁes pathological bladder cancer from\nimages with the semantic clues in diagnostic reports. Lau et al. [ 16] introduce the ﬁrst manually constructed VQA\ndataset in radiology, named VQA-RAD. In their study, the performances of 2 well-known CNN+LSTM architecture\n(MCB [17] and SAN [18]) are compared with human radiologists on the VQA-RAD dataset. For drug label identiﬁcation\ntasks, the image-text embedding (DLI-IT) [ 19] derived from an VGG+BiLSTM architecture, greatly outperforms\nimage-based or text-based identiﬁcation methods. Yan et al. [20] won the ﬁrst place in ImageCLEF 2019 VQA-Med\n[21] competition using the \"VGG16+BERT+MFB\" model. Unlike conventional architectures using RNN for text\nembedding, they encode the semantic questions using the last and penultimate hidden states of the BERT model.\nChest X-Ray datasets are widely used in V+L researches. The joint image-text embedding can be learned from easily\naccessible Chest X-ray images and free-text radiology reports. TieNet [22], an end-to-end CNN+RNN architecture,\nis developed to learn a blend of distinctive image and text representations from the ChestXray14 [23] dataset and are\nfurther used for thoracic ﬁndings classiﬁcation and automatic X-ray report generation. Zhang et al. [ 24] achieve better\ninterpretation for OpenI [25] Chest X-Ray dataset by using dual attention mechanisms to distill visual features with\nsemantic features. Hsu et al. [26] explore supervised and unsupervised methods to learn joint image-text embedding\nfrom MIMIC-CXR [27] dataset. The joint representations are further examined by a document retrieval task.\nWe observe that there is a signiﬁcant gap between the models for joint embedding generation. Transformer-based pre-\ntrained models are widely used in the general domain while in the biomedical domain, CNN-RNN based architectures\nare still predominating. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) We compare 4 pre-trained Transformer-based V+L\nmodels of learning joint image-text embedding from chest radiographs and associated reports; (2) We conduct extrinsic\nevaluation to compare these V+L models with a pioneering CNN-RNN model (TieNet); (3) We explore the advantage\nof joint embedding over text-only embedding, pre-training over train-from-scratch and other model components by a\ndetailed ablation study.\n2 Methodology\nIn this section, we introduce how to ﬁne-tune pre-trained V+L models for a multi-label thoracic ﬁndings classiﬁer from\nChest X-ray images and associated reports. This experiment can be considered as a visual question answering (VQA)\ntask. The workﬂow is illustrated in Fig. 1.\n2.1 Data\n2.1.1 MIMIC-CXR\nMIMIC-CXR[27] is the largest publicly available Chest X-ray dataset that contains 377,110 radiographs and 227,827\nfree-text radiology associated reports. 13 thoracic ﬁndings (detailed in the ‘Finding’ column of Table 3) and ‘ No\nFinding’ (absence of all 13 ﬁndings) are derived from radiology reports by using 2 auto-annotators: CheXpert [28] and\nNegBio [29]. Each label is categorized into one of four classes: positive, negative, uncertain and missing.\nWe pre-process the data as follows. First, as one radiology report can be associated with multiple radiographs, we\nonly keep the ﬁrst frontal view radiograph in chronological order. Those reports without any frontal view radiographs\nare discarded. Then, we re-categorize the labels of radiology reports from 4 classes: positive, negative, uncertain\nand missing to 2 classes: positive and all others. This step helps us keep our processed labels consistent with other\npublic chest X-ray datasets (e.g. ChestXRay14, Open I). In total, we have 222,713 image-report pairs and each pair\ncorresponds to 14 binary labels. The sample numbers and prevalence of each ﬁnding are shown in the #,% columns in\nTable 3.\n2.2 Open I\nOpenI[30] is another publicly available chest X-ray dataset collected by Indiana University. The dataset contains 3,996\nradiology reports associated with 8,121 images. Unlike MIMIC-CXR, which is annotated by auto-annotators, OpenI\ndataset is labeled by medical professionals manually using Medical Subject Heading [31] (MeSH) indexing. We apply\nthe same pre-processing steps as TieNet and yielded 3,684 image-report pairs. Each pair is assigned multiple MeSH\nterms by human-annotators. For comparison purposes, we only keep the ﬁndings that also present in MIMIC-CXR. The\npositive pair sample numbers and prevalence of selected ﬁndings are shown in the #,% columns in Table 2.\n2\nA PREPRINT - SEPTEMBER 4, 2020\nFigure 1: Overview of applying V+L models to learn joint image-text embedding from CXR images and associated\nreports for thoracic ﬁndings identiﬁcation.\nfinal report indication : ___ year old man with respiratory failure and multifocal pnas/p pea arrest // interval change comparison : radiographs from ___ a ___ a.m.. impression : support lines and tubes are unchanged in position. heart size is upper limits of normal but stable. there is persistent pulmonary edema with a more focal area of increased density in the left long which has increased since prior. there is a developing left retrocardiac opacity. no pneumothoraxes.\nMIMIC CXR / Open I\nReports\nRadiographs\nTokenizer\nVisual Extractor\nWordPiece\nBUTD or CheXNet\nTokenEmbedding[CLS][final][report][final]\n[##ra][##xes][SEP]…\nVisual TokenEmbedding…\nPositionEmbedding[0][1][2][3]\n[107][108][109]…\n++++\n+++\nLocationEmbedding[𝒙𝟏𝟎,𝒚𝟏𝟎,𝒙𝟐𝟎,𝒚𝟐𝟎]\n[𝒙𝟏𝟏,𝒚𝟏𝟏,𝒙𝟐𝟏,𝒚𝟐𝟏]\n[𝒙𝟏𝟑𝟒,𝒚𝟏𝟑𝟒,𝒙𝟐𝟑𝟒,𝒚𝟐𝟑𝟒]\n[𝒙𝟏𝟑𝟓,𝒚𝟏𝟑𝟓,𝒙𝟐𝟑𝟓,𝒚𝟐𝟑𝟓]\n+\n+\n+\n+\nTypeEmbedding[Text][Text]\n[Text]\n[Text]\n[Text]…\n++++\n+++ [Text]\n[Text]\n…\nTypeEmbedding[Image]\n[Image]\n[Image]\n[Image]\n+\n+\n+\n+ …\nVisualBERT/ LXMERT / UNITER / PixelBERT\nPre-trainedV+L modelsImage-TextJoint EmbeddingClassification Head…\n✕Enlarged Cardiomediastinum\n✔Cardiomegaly\n✔Airspace Opacity✕Lung Lesion\n✔Edema✕Consolidation✕Pneumonia✕Atelectasis✕Pneumothorax✕Pleural Effusion✕Pleural Other✕Fracture\n✔Support Devices\nTable 1: A comparison across four pre-trained vision-and-language models and two language representation models.\nModel PretrainingDataset Pretraining Tasks* Visual Encoder Location Features Model Architecture**TransformerStreams BaselinePerformance***\nUNITER[11] COCO [32]+VG [33]+CC [34]+SBU [35] MLM+MRM+ITM+WRA BUTD [36] [top, left, bottom,right, width, height,area] of ROIs 12 BertLayers Single 72.70 (COCO)\nLXMERT[13] COCO+VG+VQA2.0 [6]+GQA [37]+VG-QA [38]MLM+MRM+ITM+IQA BUTD [top, left, bottom,right] of ROIs\n9 BertLayers for language,5 BertLayers for vision,5 CrossAttLayers forcross-modality\nDouble 72.40 (COCO)\nVisualBERT[12] COCO+VQA2.0 MLM+ITM+Task-speciﬁcPretraining BUTD - 12 BertLayers Single 70.80 (COCO)\nPixelBERT[39] COCO+VG MLM+ITM ResNeXt [40](Trainable) - 12 BertLayers Single 74.45 (COCO)\nBERT[41] BookCorpus+English-Wiki[42] MLM+NSP - - 12 BertLayers Single 77.6 (MedNLI)\nClinicalBERT[43] MIMIC-III [44] MLM+NSP - - 12 BertLayers Single 80.8 (MedNLI)\n*MLM: Mask Languae Modeling; MRM: Mask Region Modeling: ITM: Image-Text Matching; WRA: Word-Region Alignment;IQA: Image Question Answering; NSP: Next sentence prediction.**BertLayer is a self-attention layer followed by a feed-forward layer; CrossAttLayer is a cross-attention layer followed by a feed-forward layer.***For V+L models, we report the accuracy performed on test-dev of COCO; For language representation models, we report the accuray performed on MedNLI [45]\n2.3 Models\nWe investigate 4 trending vision-and-language models: VisualBERT, UNITER, LXMERT, and PixelBERT. A detailed\ncomparison of these models is outlined in Table 1. In summary, all 4 V+L models use the COCO [32] dataset as their\npre-training material. Some other data sources, such as Visual Genome [ 33], VQA 2.0 [21] are added to enrich the\ntraining materials. Inspired by the masked language modeling (MLM) and next-sentence prediction of the BERT model,\nMLM conditioned on images and image-text matching (IMT) are adopted by all 4 V+L models. Only VisualBERT\nrequires task-speciﬁc training to improve the performance on downstream tasks. Bottom-up top-down (BUTD) [36],\nadopted by VisualBERT, UNITER, and LXMERT, is the most common region-based visual encoder in V+L models.\nHowever, region-based visual encoders are designed for speciﬁc visual tasks and are limited by the given categories of\nthe object detection tasks. PixelBERT creatively solves the limitation of region-based visual representation by proposing\na CNN-based visual encoder. Note that the self-attention mechanism in the Transformer model is order-less, thus\n3\nA PREPRINT - SEPTEMBER 4, 2020\nTable 2: AUCs of identifying 7 thoracic ﬁndings from OpenI dataset using TieNet, 4 pre-trained vision-and-language\nmodels, and 2 language representation models.\nFindings Image+Report Report # %TieNet-I+R VisualBERT LXMERT UNITER PixelBERT TieNet-R BERT ClinicalBERT\nCardiomegaly 0.962 0.977 0.980 0.978 0.970 0.944 0.976 0.969 315 8.55Edema 0.995 0.982 0.995 0.989 0.995 0.984 0.987 0.976 40 1.09Consolidation 0.989 0.996 0.993 0.998 0.975 0.969 0.978 0.982 28 0.76Pneumonia 0.994 0.990 0.990 0.988 0.969 0.983 0.970 0.982 36 0.98Atelectasis 0.972 0.992 0.989 0.982 0.959 0.981 0.927 0.947 293 7.95Pneumothorax 0.960 0.988 0.958 0.983 0.982 0.960 0.930 0.973 22 0.60Pleural Effusion 0.977 0.985 0.983 0.983 0.970 0.968 0.961 0.976 140 3.80\nAverage 0.978 0.987 0.984 0.986 0.974 0.970 0.961 0.972\n#w Average* 0.971 0.985 0.984 0.982 0.968 0.965 0.956 0.964\n*#w Averaged denotes the sample number weighted average of AUC.\nUNITER and LXMERT employ one layer of location features in addition to the original visual features. LXMERT is the\nonly model that has two transformer streams that learns visual and text embedding separately, and further incorporates\nthem with cross-attention layers to achieve joint embedding.\nPreliminary results show that TieNet-R, an attention-based LSTM model that only needs contextual input, also yielded\na competitive result. This is in line with expectations since radiology reports are generated by experienced radiologists\nthat contain richer and more interpretative information compared with images. Moreover, the ﬁnding labels are\nauto-annotated by CheXpert, a rule-based text classiﬁer, on radiology reports. Therefore, it is natural that applying\ntext-only embedding methods also achieves a good performance. To this end, BERT and ClinicalBERT [ 43], two\npre-trained language representation models, are also involved in our study for the purpose of exploring the advantages of\nimage-text joint embedding over text-only embedding. These two models have the same Transformer-based architecture\nas PixelBERT, VisualBERT, and UNITER. BERT obtained state-of-the-art results on 11 NLP tasks when released.\nClinicalBERT, trained on MIMIC-III [44] dataset, enhances adaptability of BERT for the clinical domain and yields\nperformance improvements on clinical NLP tasks.\n2.4 Implementations\nWe ﬁrst ﬁne-tune the 4 V+L models to learn a joint image-text embedding (the last hidden-state of [CLS] token) from\nthe training set of MIMIC-CXR. A classiﬁcation head is added on top of the joint embedding to generate the probability\nestimates of 13 thoracic ﬁndings. We use the held-out testing set of MIMIC-CXR for internal evaluation and entire\nOpenI dataset for external evaluation. It should be noted that we do not follow the ofﬁcial splits of MIMIC-CXR.\nInstead, we perform stratiﬁed split and use 80% of the entire dataset as the training set, 10% as developing set for\nTable 3: AUCs of identifying 13 thoracic ﬁndings from MIMIC-CXR dataset by ﬁne-tuning 4 pre-trained vision-and-\nlanguage models and 2 language representation models.

All other 3\nV+L models as well as BERT and ClinicalBERT are ﬁne-tuned for 6 epochs as the pre-trained weights can be loaded.\nSGD optimizer, with weight decay 5e-4 and learning rate 0.01 scheduled decay by 10 at the 12 th and 16th epoch, is\nused to optimize the CheXNet backbone in PixelBERT. AdamW is used to optimize the Transformer block(s) in all\nmodels. Each model can be ﬁt into 1 Tesla K40 GPU when using a batch size of 16. Our implementation can be found\nat: https://github.com/YIKUAN8/Transformers-VQA\n3 Results\nThe model performance on OpenI dataset are shown in Table 2. All V+L models yield a high AUC of over 0.958 for all\nﬁndings. VisualBERT, LXMERT and UNITER achieve higher averaged AUC (0.984+) and sample number weighted\nAUC (0.982+) than TieNet-I+R (0.978 and 0.971) in OpenI dataset. While PixelBERT, without any pre-training,\nperforms slightly worse than TieNet-I+R. The supreme performance demonstrates all V+L models’ great adaptability to\nbiomedical domain. When digging into a particular ﬁnding, TieNet only outperforms V+L models in the classiﬁcation\nof edema and pneumonia.\nWe use the held-out test split of MIMIC-CXR to make a more comprehensive comparison of 4 V+L models. The results\nare revealed in the default column of Table 3. VisualBERT yields the best averaged AUC of 0.987, followed by 0.985\nusing UNITER and 0.984 using LXMERT. PixelBERT only achieves a moderate AUC of 0.953 due to the absence\nof the pre-training. When comparing the performance on different ﬁndings, we surprisingly ﬁnd that VisualBERT\nachieves the best results on 11 out of 13 ﬁndings. Although VisualBERT adopts the least pre-training tasks and the\nsimplest model architecture, we believe the introduction of task-speciﬁc training for VQA contributes to this optimal\nperformance. LXMERT outperforms others in Pleural Others and Fracture, which are the two least prevalent ﬁndings.\nWe also notice that it is harder to identifyEnlarged Cardiomediastinum compared with other abnormalities. We attribute\nthis to the absence of lateral view X-ray images in our training set in that the cardiomediastinum contour is easier to\nrecognize from a lateral view. Moreover, it is as expected that UNITER does not have a supreme performance in our\nstudy as we adopt the base version of UNITER. UNITERlarger is much larger than UNITERbase in both number of layers\nand trainable parameters. We believe that UNITERlarger can achieve better results given its phenomenal performance in\ngeneral domain.\n5\nA PREPRINT - SEPTEMBER 4, 2020\nFigure 3: Results of three classiﬁcation samples.

When using joint\nembedding, TieNet only receives less than 1% performance improvement over the text-only embedding in the OpenI\ndataset. While, VisualBERT, LXMERT, and UNITER receives more than 2 % improvement over BERT and 1 %\nover ClinicalBERT, respectively. This larger performance improvement demonstrates that transformer-based models\nare better at image-text interaction compared with the CNN-RNN architecture. In the test split of MIMIC-CXR, the\nimprovement of V+L models over BERT model is even larger (more than 6%).\nAdditionally, although VisualBERT, LXMERT, and UNITER have different model architectures, embedding, and\npre-training strategies, they all yield comparable results in both internal held-out evaluation and external data resources.\nThis is in line with expectation because these V+L models all have supreme performance and rank top 10 in the general\ndomain (evaluated by coco test-dev). This also indicates that although BUTD is pre-trained in general domain from\nVisual Genome, it could also extract useful ROIs from biomedical images.\n6\nA PREPRINT - SEPTEMBER 4, 2020\nTable 4: Layer-level modality importance scores.

Then, we use\nvisualization to illustrate the attention details. Finally, we discuss the limitations of our current work and our plans for\nfurther studies.\n4.1 Pre-training versus Training From Scratch\nWe explore whether pre-training strategies and tasks that are utilized in the general domain contribute to our joint\nrepresentation learning in the biomedical domain. As a comparative study, we do not load the pre-trained weights and\nrandomly initialize the weights for VisualBERT, LXMERT, and UNITER. These 3 V+L models are directly trained to\nclassify thoracic ﬁndings without any pre-training. We train these models for 12 epochs. The results of training from\nscratch are shown in the FS columns of Table 2 and are compared to the Default columns. The pre-training procedure\nimproves the averaged AUC of VisualBERT by 3%, UNITER by 2.3% and LXMERT by 2%. This conﬁrms that the\npre-training tasks contribute to generating more meaningful joint embedding. In the contrast, PixelBERT achieves\nstate-of-the-art results in many NLP tasks in general domain, our train-from-scratch PixelBERT underperforms the\nother 3 pre-trained model signiﬁcantly. This also indicates that pre-training is of great importance to multimodal\nrepresentation learning.\n4.2 BERT versus ClinicalBERT\nWe observe that ClinicalBERT outperforms BERT by 5.8% in MIMIC-CXR and 1.1% in OpenI. It is as expected\nin that ClinicalBERT is pre-trained using MIMIC-III which is also released by PhysioNet. Compared with BERT,\nClinicalBERT adapts better to biomedical data. Inspired by this, we replace the BERT vocabulary and embedding\nlayer in VisualBERT, LXMERT and UNITER by clinicalBERT. In terms of implementation, we load all the pre-trained\nparameters except the text embedding layer to those 3 V+L models. We also train the models for 12 epochs in hope of\nmore training epochs will help V+L models adapt to the new vocabulary and embedding layer. The results of using\nClinicalBERT components are shown in the CB columns of Table 3. Compared with the default conﬁguration, we do\nnot observe any performance boosting. We believe the 12 training epochs are still not sufﬁcient to adjust the parameters\nto adapt the a new language representation model.\n4.3 Trainable Visual Backbone versus Frozen Visual Backbone\nWe are also interested in whether a trainable visual CNN backbone is beneﬁcial. This experiment is also conducted in the\noriginal work of PixelBERT. We adopt another conﬁguration of PixelBERT by freezing all the layers of CheXNet, the\nvisual backbone CNN. All other hyper-parameters and technical details remain the same. The results of the PixelBERT\nwith a frozen CNN backbone can be found in the NT column of Table 3. PixelBERT with frozen CheXNet only yields\na moderate averaged AUC of less than 0.8, which underperforms the default conﬁguration of more than 15%. This\nindicates that it is very important to adjust the weights of the visual backbone model when applying feature map of the\nCNN model to generate image representations.\n4.4 Visualization\nSimilar to [47], we ﬁrst visualize selected attention maps of the best performed VisualBERT to illustrate the attention\nmechanism. In a), b) and c) of Fig. 2, we observe several interesting patterns. Fig. 2a shows a block pattern. Only\nintra-modality (text self-attention and image self-attention) can be observed in this attention map. Fig. 2b has a\nvertical pattern that illustrates Text-to-Image and Text-to-Text attentions in this layer. Besides, we can see some special\ntokens are heavily attended. Fig. 2c visualizes the attention scores of a head in the penultimate layer. Text-to-Image,\nImage-to-Text and Text self-attention can be found in this attention map. When comparing the difference of these 3\nattention maps, we observe there is a trending that the deeper layers demonstrate more interaction between image and\ntext, while self-attention predominate in the beginning several layers. Furthermore, to quantitatively analyze the [CLS]\nattention trace, we calculate the layer-level Modality Importance (MI) scores introduced in [48] of textual and visual\n7\nA PREPRINT - SEPTEMBER 4, 2020\nmodality, respectively. The result is shown in Table 4. We can see that layer-level MI scores for text modality are\nsigniﬁcantly higher than those for visual modality, especially at intermediate layers. This suggests that more attention\nheads learn useful knowledge from the textual modality than image modality.\n4.5 Error Analysis\nFor error analysis analysis, the top 10 tokens across all heads and layers with highest attention scores attended by the\n[CLS] token are highlighted in the Fig. 3. All three cases are sampled from OpenI. In Fig. 3a, a sample diagnosed\nwith Atelectasis, Pleural Effusion is correctly classiﬁed. We can observe that keywords, such as atelectatic collapse,\nopacity, effusion, display high attention by the classiﬁcation token. Visual token #9, which precisely targets the contour\nof the collapse of the right middle lobe, also greatly contributes to the classiﬁcation. On the contrary, Fig. 3b illustrates\na false negative sample. This sample is wrongly classiﬁed to positive Pneumothorax by our model. As shown in the\nradiology report of this sample, there is a large hydropneumothorax within the left lung. Given that all V+L models\nuse WordPiece, which is a subword algorithm, hydropneumothorax is tokenized to a superset of pneumothorax. The\ntokenization mechanism of V+L models results in this kind of false positive classiﬁcation. Fig. 3c demonstrates a false\nnegative sample. This patient is diagnosed with Cardiomegaly, Edema, and Pleural Effusion. However, only Edema is\nidentiﬁed by our classiﬁer. When digging into the speciﬁc tokens, no ﬁnding-related words but nodular opacity receive\na high attention score. Pleural Effusion in the context is truncated as we set the maximum text sequence to 128. While,\nwe can see that visual token #8 precisely targets thoracic-spine and T-spine in radiology report also has a high attention\nscore. This demonstrates the strong image-text alignment ability of V+L models.\n4.6 Limitation and Future Work\nOur study has several limitations, each of which brings a great opportunity for future work. First, we barely tune\nthe hyper-parameters or CNN backbone architectures of the V+L models, which has the potential of achieving better\nperformance. For example, we could apply deeper CNN backbones, such as ResNet152 to extract visual features\nfor PixelBERT. Additionally, due to the limitation of computation resources, we are unable to implement domain-\nspeciﬁc pre-training. According to the previous studies [12, 13], domain-speciﬁc pre-training will enhance the model’s\nadaptability and therefore improve the performance of domain-speciﬁc tasks. Finally, we only apply the pre-trained\nV+L models to chest X-ray datasets. We are planning to examine these models on a wider range of biomedical V+L\ndatasets and tasks, such as BCIDR [15], VQA-Med [21] with more conﬁgurations as our next step.\n5 Conclusion\nIn this study, we examine the ability of four transformer-based V+L models in learning joint image-text embedding from\nchest X-ray images and associated reports. The extrinsic evaluation shows that pre-trained V+L models outperform\ntraditional CNN-RNN methods. Ablation studies demonstrate the advantage of joint embedding over text embedding\nand the beneﬁts of the pre-training procedures. Future studies will focus on pre-training V+L models using biomedical\ndataset and down-stream the pre-trained models to more biomedical V+L tasks.\n6 Acknowledgment\nThis study is supported in part by NIH grant 1R01LM013337.\nReferences\n[1] Dongfei Yu, Jianlong Fu, Tao Mei, and Yong Rui.
