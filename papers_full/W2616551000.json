It consists of a\nstring of symbols that when spoken, unfolds in time. When tokenized, it is composed of 13\nword forms, belonging to seven distinct grammatical categories, and 40 phonemes (see Section\n2.4). Although a natural language sentence is a linear sequence of surface forms, it allows to be\ndecomposed into different levels of information at the phrasal, word, and sub-word level.\nThese levels of information are what we might call, following traditional linguistic schools:\nsyntax, lexico-semantics, and phonology [1, 2]. The sentence as a sequence of words co-exists\nwith the sentence as a sequence of phonemes and the sentence as a sequence of grammatical\ncategories. Models of language processing typically decompose language into these co-existing\nlevels of information [3]. These different levels are probably processed at least partially\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.01777 94 May 18, 2017 1 / 18\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\nOPEN ACCESS\nCitation: Lopopolo A, Frank SL, van den Bosch A,\nWillems RM (2017) Using stochastic language\nmodels (SLM) to map lexical, syntactic, and\nphonologica l information processing in the brain.\nPLoS ONE 12(5): e0177794. https://doi.o rg/\n10.1371/ journal.pone. 0177794\nEditor: Philip Allen, University of Akron, UNITED\nSTATES\nReceived: January 16, 2017\nAccepted: May 3, 2017\nPublished: May 18, 2017\nCopyright: © 2017 Lopopo lo et al.

It is therefore no surprise that the study of the neural\nbasis of language comprehension has adhered to studying one of these types of information at\na time. That is, there are dedicated studies investigating syntactic aspects of comprehension,\nlexico-semantic aspects of comprehension, phonological aspects of comprehension, and so on\n(the recent textbook by Kemmerer offers a clear overviews of the state of the art in each subdis-\ncipline in the cognitive neuroscience of language [6]). Here, we aim to investigate the neural\nbasis of the three streams of information processing during language comprehension simulta-\nneously, within one experiment. In other words, we want to know whether we can fractionate\nthe neural signature of language processing of natural speech in different, parallel streams\nwithin one and the same data set.\nIn order to do so, we fitted characterizations of lexical, phonological and syntactic informa-\ntion to fMRI data collected while participants listened to narratives. Brain activity time-locked\nto each word is regressed on the three model-derived measures. Stochastic language models\ncomputed at the word, part-of-speech and phoneme level are used to operationalize the con-\ncept of parallel lexical, syntactic and phonetic streams. We rely on stochastic models because,\nas detailed in Section 1.1, they have been proven powerful tools for the study of language com-\nprehension. Such an approach goes beyond the typical studies in which one level of processing\nis studied per experiment.\nWe begin with a short overview of work in modelling language comprehension using sto-\nchastic language models in Section 1.1. In Section 1.2 we introduce the Streams of processing\nframework. In section 2 we present the methodological details of the study, focusing both on\nthe stochastic language models and the computational linguistic techniques employed to anno-\ntate and extract lexical, syntactic and phonological information from a common stimulus.\nSection 2 also provides details on the fMRI data collection paradigm. Section 3 describes the\nregression analysis employed to delineate the neural correlates of each level of information.\nFinally, in Sections 4 and 5 we report the results and draw conclusions according to the\nhypotheses expressed in the previous sections.\n1.1 Language processing as a sequential stochastic process\nA number of studies [7–11] have advanced the hypothesis that the brain employs predictive\ncoding strategies in perception. The hypothesis is that after processing the first t − 1 elements\nof a sequence of stimuli (i.e., x\n1\n, . . ., x\nt−1\n), the human brain assigns a conditional probability\nP(x\nt\n|x\n1\n, . . ., x\nt−1\n) to each potential element x that can follow at time t. These expectations influ-\nence the way the actual observed x\nt\nis processed eventually. Deviations from expectations are\nusually quantified in terms of surprisal or perplexity, which have been shown to explain both\nbehavioural and neural correlates of perceptual and higher cognitive processing.\nIn the domain of language processing, word surprisal has been used to predict a wide\nrange of behavioural correlates. It has been found to predict the duration of spoken words,\nwith shorter words being used in less surprising situations [12, 13]. Following Hale [14] and\nLevy [15], surprisal has been hypothesized to be proportional to the cognitive effort required\nto integrate a word into the current context. This has been confirmed by observing that it\ncorrelates with reading times [16–19]. Reading time has also been shown to be correlated to\nsurprisal of the syntactic category (part-of-speech; PoS) of the word being read [20, 21].\nMoreover, Monsalve [17] showed that PoS and word surprisal have independent effects on\nreading times. This behavioural result suggests that the PoS of words in sentential context is\na valid representation of linguistic information relevant for processing, and that computing\nprobabilistic measures on them returns a model that has significant predictive power. These\nmeasures have also been successfully applied to the prediction of brain activity. It was found\nSLMs for lexical, syntacti c, and phonologic al processing in the brain\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.01777 94 May 18, 2017 2 / 18\nthat the amplitude of the N400 event-related potential (ERP) component elicited by words in\nsentences correlates with word surprisal values [22, 23]. The fact that surprisal correlates\nwith the amplitude of a classical ERP component related to language comprehension [24] is\nanother source of evidence that stochastic language modelling is a neuro-cognitively valid\napproximation of sentence comprehension. In a recent paper, Willems and colleagues [25]\napplied surprisal and entropy to an fMRI dataset to predict brain activity in different cortical\nand subcortical areas during naturalistic language comprehension. They observed that dif-\nferent areas differentially code for statistical stimulus properties by selectively correlating\nwith one or the other measure.\n1.2 Probabilistic streams\nOur starting point is twofold. On one hand, we hypothesize that different types of information\ncorrespond to different streams of processing implemented in separable networks in the brain.\nSeveral linguistic models, for instance, separate phonological, semantic and syntactic process-\ning in different neural loci or processing streams [6]. One way to operationalize this search for\nparallel streams is to model the processed linguistic input as composed by three parallel levels\nof representation corresponding to its phonological, lexical and syntactic profile. On the other\nhand, following the findings exposed in section 1.1, we model the processing in these separate\nstreams as sequential and incremental, and sensitive to the stochastic properties of the infor-\nmation it is applied to. The difference between different streams is that the probabilistic rela-\ntions are computed not only on surface forms (bare words, so to speak) but on the phonemic\ntranscription and the grammatical categories of the words in order to disentangle the different\nlevels of representation.\nThe fact that language can be studied as a stochastic process does not necessarily mean\nthat subcomponents of language correspond to distinct stochastic processes that are detect-\nable in the brain. One scenario could be that the areas sensitive to stochastic properties of the\ninput are the same, independently from the level of annotation on which such measures have\nbeen computed. In a recent study, Nastase and colleagues [26] investigated whether there\nexist areas in the brain that are sensitive to probabilistic properties of the incoming signal,\nindependently from its sensory modality, or if, conversely, sensitivity to such properties is an\nintrinsic characteristic of domain-specific areas. Their approach consisted in looking for\nareas coding for the degree of disorder—quantified by Markov entropy—in a temporally\nunfolding sensory input of two distinct modalities: auditory and visual. Their results show a\nmodality specific sensitivity to input entropy, implemented in modality-specific systems of\nsensory cortices (for visual stimuli: the early visual cortex, the anterior cingulate, and the\nintraparietal sulcus; for acoustic stimuli: inferior frontal, lateral temporal, and supplementary\nmotor regions). Ventral premotor and central cingulate cortices were identified as possible\ncandidates for modality-general uncertainty processing, exhibiting sensitivity to disorder in\nboth modalities.\nWe approach the problem of disentangling phonology, lexical and syntax by using language\nstimuli which are not explicitly designed to study one of these levels in isolation [22, 25]. Using\none stochastic measure computed on three distinct levels of annotations of the same linguistic\nstimulus, we want to investigate first of all level-specific processing, what we may refer to as\nstreams of information. On the other hand, we are interested in investigating the issue of\nwhether there exists a central supramodal stochastic processor of the brain (what is called\nmodality-independent in [26]) by finding areas that are sensitive to stochastic measures inde-\npendently from the level of information they have been computed on.\nSLMs for lexical, syntacti c, and phonologic al processing in the brain\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.01777 94 May 18, 2017 3 / 18\n2 Materials and methods\nEthical approval was obtained from the CMO Committee on Research Involving Human Sub-\njects, Arnhem-Nijmegen , The Netherlands (protocol number 2001/095), in line with the Dec-\nlaration of Helsinki.\n2.1 Participants and stimuli\nWe re-analysed data from an fMRI study on language comprehension of auditory presented\nnarrative texts [25]. Here we briefly present the data collection procedure, preprocessing, and\nstimuli employed. Full details can be found in the original paper.\nTwenty-four healthy, native speakers of Dutch (8 males; mean age 22.9, range 18–31) with-\nout psychiatric or neurological problems, with normal or corrected-to-normal vision, and\nwithout hearing problems took part in the experiment. All participants except one were right-\nhanded by self-report, and all participants were naive with respect to the purpose of the experi-\nment. Written informed consent was obtained in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki,\nand the study was approved by the local ethics committee. Participants were paid either in\nmoney or in course credit at the end of the study.\nStimuli consisted of three excerpts from three distinct literary novels extracted from the\nSpoken Dutch Corpus, “Corpus Gesproken Nederlands” (CGN) [27]. The excerpts were\nspoken at a normal rate, in a quiet room, by female speakers (one speaker per story). Stimu-\nlus durations were 3:49 min (622 words), 7:50 min (1,291 words), and 7:48 min (1,131\nwords). Reversed speech versions of the stories were created with Audacity 2.03 (http://\nwww.audacityteam.org/).\n2.2 Procedure\nThe experimental paradigm consisted in passively listening to the three narratives and their\nreversed versions (for a total of six sessions) inside the MRI scanner. Each story and its\nreversed speech counterpart were presented following each other. Half the participants\nstarted with a non-reversed stimulus, and half with a reversed speech stimulus. Participants\nwere instructed to listen to the materials attentively, which in practice is only possible for\nthree narratives, and not for the reversed speech counterparts. There was a short break after\neach fragment.\nStimuli were presented with Presentation 16.2 (https://www.neurobs.com/). Auditory sti-\nmuli were presented through MR-compatible earphones. In order to make sure participants\ncould correctly perceive the stimuli, the actual experimental sessions were preceded by an in-\nscanner volume test where a fragment from another story with comparable voice and sound\nquality was presented and the volume was adjusted to the optimal level based on feedback\nfrom the participant.\nAfter the scanning session, participants were tested for their memory and comprehension\nof the stories. The participants were not informed in advance about the test in order to avoid\nattentional biases during the passive listening to the stories.\n2.3 fMRI data acquisition and preprocessing\nImages of blood-oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) changes were acquired on a 3-T Sie-\nmens Magnetom Trio scanner (Erlangen, Germany) with a 32-channel head coil. Pillows and\ntape were used to minimize participants’ head movement, and the earphones that were used\nfor presenting the stories reduced scanner noise. Functional images were acquired using a fast\nT2\n\u0003\n-weighted 3D echo planar imaging sequence [28], with high temporal resolution (time to\nSLMs for lexical, syntacti c, and phonologic al processing in the brain\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.01777 94 May 18, 2017 4 / 18\nrepetition: 880 ms, time to echo: 28 ms, flip angle: 14˚, voxel size: 3.5 × 3.5 × 3.5 mm, 36 slices).\nHigh resolution (1 × 1 × 1.25 mm) structural (anatomical) images were acquired using a T1\nsequence.\nPreprocessing was performed using SPM8 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac. uk/spm) and Matlab\n2010b (http://www.mathworks.nl/). The first four volumes were removed to control for T1\nequilibration effects. Rigid body registration was used to realign images. Images were realigned\nto the first image within each run. The mean of the motion-corrected images was then brought\ninto the same space as the individual participant’s anatomical scan. The anatomical and func-\ntional scans were spatially normalized to the standard MNI template, and functional images\nwere re-sampled to 2 × 2 × 2 mm voxel sizes. Finally, an isotropic 8-mm full-width at half-\nmaximum Gaussian kernel was used to spatially smooth the motion-corrected and normalized\ndata.\n2.4 Estimation of stream-wise stochastic properties\nThe three levels of information –phonological, syntactic and lexical– are distinguished by\napplying three different levels of annotation to the stimulus narratives. At the phonological\nlevel, the words in the running text are transformed into a sequence of phonemes. The syntac-\ntic level is approximated by the sequence of fine-grained syntactic categories corresponding to\nthe words of the texts, also known as parts of speech (PoS). The lexical level consists of the\nsequence of surface lexical forms composing the texts. In the sections below we describe the\ncharacteristics of each stream and their common computational properties.\nThe lexical level is the sequence of words constituting the sentences of the book fragments.\nAt this level, a sentence can be rewritten as a sequence w\n1\n, . . ., w\nn\nof symbols w\ni\nbelonging to\nthe vocabulary V containing all the word form, as illustrated in Table 1.\nThe phonological stream can be defined as the sequence of phonemes composing each sin-\ngle word in the sentence. Therefore, the sentence in Table 1 can be rewritten as a sequence\np\n1\n1\n; p\n2\n1\n; :::; p\nm\n1\n; :::; p\n1\n13\n; ::: ; p\no\n13\nwhere p\ni\nj\nrefers to the i\nth\nphoneme of the j\nth\nword in the sentence.\nTable 2 contains the phonetic transcription of the example sentence already presented in\nTable 1.\nFinally, the words in the stimuli are assigned with their syntactic categories, or part of\nspeech tags (PoS). Parts of speech are a basic ingredient of most language technology systems\nand act as shallow (i.e., non-hierarchical) syntactic starting point for many other tasks, includ-\ning semantic role assignment and dependency and constituent syntactic parsing. They usually\nconsist of a basic set of grammatical categories such as nouns (N), verbs (WW, in the Dutch\ntags used here), modifiers and determiners. They capture, when considered in context, shal-\nlow, yet robust, combinatorial constraints that abstract away from the lexical information\nwithin the surface forms. The tagset employed here was the one employed by CGN (the corpus\nTable 1.

Table 4 contains an example of PoS annotation of the example sen-\ntence presented in Table 1 above.\n2.5 Computing stochastic measures\nThe conditional probabilities required for obtaining perplexity values for the lexical and PoS\nstreams are estimated by a second-order Markov model, also known as trigram model, trained\non a large collection of text. It is based on the simplifying assumption that the probability\nof word w\nt\ndepends on the previous two words only, that is, P(w\nt\n|w\n1\n, . . ., w\nt−1\n) is reduced to\nP(w\nt\n|w\n1\n, . . ., w\nt−1\n). Surprisal is computed as the negative logarithm of the conditional probabil-\nity of wt given w\nt−2\n, w\nt−1\n:\nsurp risa lðw\nt\nÞ ¼ \u0000 log P ðw\nt\njw\nt \u0000 2\n; w\nt \u0000 1\nÞ\nIf the observed word’s probability equals 1, observing it yields a surprisal of 0. Conversely,\nthe occurrence of a word that was not among the words considered possible (i.e., has zero\nprobability) corresponds to infinite surprisal. Surprisal can be thought of as the degree to\nwhich the actually perceived word w\nt\ndeviates from expectation. Perplexity, as adopted here,\nconsists in an exponential transformation of the surprisal of encountering w\nt\ngiven w\nt−2\n, w\nt−1\n.\npplðw\nt\nÞ ¼ 2\nsur pri salðw\nt\nÞ\n¼ 2\n\u0000 log P ðw\nt\njw\nt \u0000 1\nÞ\nThe dataset from which probabilities P(w\nt\n|w\n1\n, . . ., w\nt−1\n) are estimated is a random selection\nof 10 million sentences (comprising 197 million word tokens; 2.1 million types) from the\nTable 3.

For lexical perplexity, each word of the experi-\nmental texts is assigned a value computed by SRILM [31].\nThe PoS perplexity is computed analogously. Instead of using the surface forms of the\ntraining and stimulus set, the trigram model was trained on the PoS-tagged version of the\nsame 10 million sentences subset of NLCOW2012. The tagging was performed using the Frog\ntoolbox for natural language processing of Dutch text [32].\nThe phonological information was extracted from the phonemic transcription of each word\nin the stimulus set. We used a memory-based grapheme phoneme converter [33] trained on\nCELEX 2 [34]. Once every word is transcribed as a sequence of phonemes, trigrams were\nextracted and conditional probabilities P(p\nt\n|p\nt−1\n, p\nt−2\n) were computed using WOPR (https://\nilk.uvt.nl/wopr/) trained on CELEX 2 [34]. Once phoneme-wise perplexity is computed, the\nphonetic perplexity of each word of the stimulus is computed as the average value across the\nphonemes of that word.\n3 Data analysis\nAt the single-subject level, the observed BOLD time course in each voxel is subjected to a\nregression analysis, testing for voxels in which the covariates of interest (word, PoS, and pho-\nnological perplexity) explain a significant proportion of variance of that voxel’s time course\n[35]. Before the actual analysis, one regressor modelling the duration of each single word was\ncreated for each story. This regressor was convolved with the hemodynamic response function,\nto account for the delay in BOLD activation respective to stimulus presentation. The word\nduration regressor and the covariates for a story were also fitted to the data of the reversed\nspeech version of that story. This served as a control condition since the regressors and covari-\nates are essentially meaningless for the reversed speech data. Three covariates were computed\ncontaining each word’s word, PoS and phonemic perplexity measures, constituting our regres-\nsors of interest modelling the three information streams introduced above. Besides these,\nlog2-transformed lexical frequency per word was computed using the Subtlex NL corpus [36],\nlog2-transformed PoS frequency per word was computed using the CGN corpus [27], and\nlog2-transformed phoneme frequency average per word was computed using CELEX 2 [34].\nThey were used as regressors of no interest to statistically factor out effects of word, PoS and\nphoneme frequency. The estimates from the motion correction algorithm (three rotations and\nthree translations per run) were additionally added as regressors of no interest.\nThe modelled time courses from all six runs (three stories and three reversed speech sti-\nmuli) were combined in one regression model, with separate constant terms per run, but the\nsame regressors for real and reversed speech. The analyses were conducted at the whole-brain\nlevel. The difference in the effect of the regressor of interest between the real and reversed\nspeech sessions was used as input to the group-level statistics. Statistical differences were\nassessed by computing the t-statistic over participants of this difference score (real vs. reversed\nspeech) for each voxel in the brain. The resulting multiple comparisons problem was solved by\nmeans of combining a P < 0.005 voxel threshold with a cluster extent threshold determined\nby means of 1,000 Monte Carlo simulations, after estimation of the smoothness of the data\napplied for each separate contrast. The combination of a voxel level threshold with a cluster\nextend threshold is a good compromise between statistical sensitivity on the one hand and\nfalse positive error control on the other hand [37, 38]. The simulations took the amount of\nautocorrelation in the data into account, as suggested in the literature [37, 38]. The scripts\nused were taken from (https://www2.bc.edu/*slotnics /scripts.html). Table 5 reports the size\nthresholds for each regressor contrast separately. All reported clusters of size display results\nsignificant at the P < 0.05 level, corrected for multiple comparisons.\nSLMs for lexical, syntacti c, and phonologic al processing in the brain\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.01777 94 May 18, 2017 7 / 18\n3.1 Relation between the regressors\nThe aim of this study is to assess whether different types of linguistic information can be traced\nin the brain, and if this can be achieved by using stochastic measures of perplexity in line with\nthe predictive brain hypothesis. In order to assess whether word, PoS, and phoneme perplexity\ncapture different kinds of information we conducted a preliminary analysis consisting in\ncomputing their pairwise correlations. Table 6 reports these correlations (Pearson’s r). Both\n3-gram perplexity (ppl) and 1-gram frequency (freq) computed at lexical, PoS, and phonologi-\ncal level are included.\nThe correlations between perplexity measures reported in Table 6 are fairly low, even\nbetween lexical and PoS perplexity (0.046). These results indicates that there is no strong rela-\ntion between the regressors we have employed in our fMRI analyses, and that they may capture\ndifferent types of information. Correlation between lexical perplexity and frequency is −0.466,\nand correlation between PoS perplexity and frequency is −0.491. These negative correlations\nbetween perplexity and frequency measures are predictable: the less frequent an item is, the\nhigher is the overall perplexity of encountering it.\n4 Results\nIn this section we present the results of the analyses conducted using the three perplexity mea-\nsures as regressors of interest. In supplementary material S2 File we report the results of a simi-\nlar analysis conducted using frequencies as regressors of interest.\n4.1 Lexical stream\nTable 7 lists the areas that show significant activity with regard to the word-based perplexity\nregressor.

We computed\nthe overlap between the activation maps relative to the lexical and the syntactic stream, the lex-\nical and phonological streams, and the syntactic and phonological stream by taking only those\nvoxels that are significantly activated for both regressors as described in the sections above.\nThis is equivalent to performing a conjunction analysis, more specifically a test of the ‘con-\njunction null’, effectively looking for statistical significance in both contrast maps as testing a\nlogical AND [39]. We also looked for voxels shared by all three streams.\nIt is interesting to note that although some degree of anatomical overlap exists among all\npossible pairs of regressors, there is no area that is significantly activated for all three streams\ntogether. What is also worth noting is that the lexical and syntactic regressors are both pro-\ncessed in the posterior portions of the bilateral middle temporal gyrus, bordering the posterior\nsuperior temporal gyrus. Moreover, lexical information and phonology seem to share activity in\nthe central banks of the superior temporal gyrus, but not directly in Heschl’s gyrus, which con-\nfirms its selectivity for the phonological stream only. The overlap regions are shown in cyan\n(lexical and syntactical streams) and in violet (syntactic and phonological streams) in Fig 4.\nTable 10.

No area shows\nselectivity for all three streams, and only limited sets of voxels show overlap between pairs of\nstreams.\n5.1 Division of labour in the temporal cortex\nThe temporal lobe shows a distribution between the three streams that sees the lexical informa-\ntion primarily concerning the infero-lateral regions, syntactic information the mid-lateral\nregions and phonological information finding its hub in the middle superior temporal plane.\nAreas posterior to the perisylvian cortex, between AG, SMG and IPL, display a similar gradi-\nent, with more rostral voxels selecting lexical information and more caudal ones phonological\ninformation, with selectivity to PoS-related information in the middle.\n5.2 Phonological stream\nThe phonological stream seems to involve activity in the temporal cortex only in regions close\nto the transverse gyrus (Heschl’s gyrus), especially in the right hemisphere. This area is the cen-\ntral hub of auditory processing [40]. Although the phonological regressor is built on a level of\nannotation that is close to the actual perceptual structure of the words, it is not directly built\non the auditory properties of the stimulus, making these observed results both surprising and\ninteresting. In addition to this, the phonological stream activates the supplementary motor\narea (SMA), which has been suggested to be involved not only in speech production [41],\nbut also in speech processing [42, 43]. Phoneme perplexity did not return activation in the pre-\nmotor cortex, an area that has been associated with speech production and perception. None-\ntheless, activation of the premotor cortex in response to phonological load is not a general\nfinding in the literature. Tremblay and colleagues [44, 45] have suggested that premotor cortex\nactivation during speech processing may only be observed under tasks presenting particularly\ndifficult conditions. In line with this position, Sato and colleagues [46] have shown that stimu-\nlating the premotor cortex only has an effect on a complex speech perception task. Similarly,\npremotor activity has been found to be modulated by syllable complexity during speech pro-\nduction but not during speech perception [44].\n5.3 Lexical and syntactic streams\n5.3.1 Middle temporal gyrus. Studies by Dronkers and colleagues [47] have suggested\nthat the posterior MTG plays a role in retrieving lexical and syntactic properties of incoming\nwords from long-term memory. Hagoort [3] suggests that MTG might be important for the\nretrieval of the syntactic frames (as well as other lexical information) from the mental lexicon\nwhich are then combined in the left inferior frontal cortex [48]. This intuition is corroborated\nby our results, which show that activity in this area, although mainly explained by the syntactic\nregressors employed in our analyses, displays an overlap between the syntactic regressor and\nthe lexical stream. The work of [49] showed that Dutch noun-verb homonyms (grammatical\ncategory ambiguity) increased activity in the posterior MTG. This study also reports that\ngrammatically ambiguous sentences activated not only the posterior MTG but also the precen-\ntral gyrus, an area that we also observe in our analysis.\nSLMs for lexical, syntacti c, and phonologic al processing in the brain\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.01777 94 May 18, 2017 13 / 18\nAlthough PoS perplexity intends to model syntactic processing and appears to be a reason-\nable correlate of the syntactic stream, our analysis shows only a marginal correlation between\nthis regressor and the activity observed in anterior temporal cortex. Studies from Pallier [50],\nObleser [51] and Brennan [52] suggest that this region is sensitive to the syntactic complexity\nof the input sentence. Brennan and colleagues used a similar experimental paradigm to the\none adopted in this paper. They had participants listen to a segment of a novel (Lewis Carroll’s\nAlice in Wonderland) and looked for areas of which the activity correlates with the number of\nso-called syntactic building operations at each time point, representing the number of non-ter-\nminal phrases that are completed by the presentation of each word. This measure is based on\na hierarchical treatment of syntax, whereas we intended to model syntactic processing in a\npurely sequential manner. These two results can be reconciled by considering syntactic pro-\ncessing as underpinned by both sequential probabilistic machinery (captured by PoS-perplex-\nity) and hierarchical structure building.\n5.3.2 Inferior temporal cortex. Activity in the inferior and lateral portions of the left tem-\nporal cortex are better explained by the lexical regressor and are likely to be a central hub of\nthe lexical stream. [25] observed the same result using the same dataset, nonetheless interpret-\ning it as activity in the visual word form area (VWFA) [53]. Their explanation is that word\nprediction can account for the pre-activation of the upcoming word form in the sequential\nsentence processing. This explanation is not the only possible one. For instance, Price [54]\npoints out that the cortical region corresponding to VWFA is active in normal subjects also\nduring tasks that do not engage visual word form processing. On the other hand, if activity in\nleft Inferior Temporal cortex and specifically in VWFA truly reflects word form prediction, we\nwould have expected also phonological perplexity to show selectivity in this region. Phonologi-\ncal perplexity, computed on the phonemic structure of each single word, seems intuitively a\ncloser proxy for the form of a word. Although computed on the phonemic transcription of the\nwords, the relation between phoneme and grapheme in Dutch is at least somewhat regular,\nmaking visual and phonemic structure intuitively close. Nonetheless, as explained above, this\nmodel does not predict activity in ITC better than word-based perplexity. This suggests indeed\nthat the coupling between the later regressor and activity in this region reflects lexico-semantic\nrather than word form information.\nThat the lexical regressor, computed in terms of trigram statistics in the co-occurrences of\nwords, is a correlate of lexical semantic processing is strengthened by the outcome of a meta-\nanalysis of 120 functional neuroimaging studies [55, 56]. The meta-analysis showed that lateral\nand ventral temporal cortex is among the main nodes of the semantic processing network.\nThis interpretation is supported by studies that reported consistent correlation between lexical\nsemantic models and brain activity in ventro-temporal cortex [57, 58].\n5.4 Left inferior frontal gyrus\nNone of the perplexity-based regressor returned significant activation in the left inferior fron-\ntal gyrus (l-IFG). While l-IFG is an important node in the neural language network, its involve-\nment and potential role during language comprehension has been the subject of considerable\ndebate.\nOne line of work starting with Thompson-Schill et al. [59] has argued that the role of this\narea is better characterized as a general, not language specific one, and involved in ‘selection’\nor—more generally—‘cognitive control’. Another approach has stressed the role of the area in\nstructural processing, both in a hierarchical and sequential fashion [60, 61]. Nonetheless, not\nall results seem to support this view. Brennan and colleagues [52, 62], for instance, found that\nsyntactic complexity did not correlate with l-IFG activity, which seems at odds with some\nSLMs for lexical, syntacti c, and phonologic al processing in the brain\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.01777 94 May 18, 2017 14 / 18\nprevious findings that did observe l-IFG activation in response to syntactically hard to parse\nsentences. The fact that l-IFG was not detected in Brennan’s work and in the work presented\nin the present paper might be due to methodological reasons. Both Brennan and we used natu-\nralistic stimuli and correlation between brain imaging data and stimuli properties (stochastic\nin our case, hierarchically structural in the case of Brennan and colleagues). The literature\nadvocating the role of l-IFG in processing is dominated instead by paradigms comparing care-\nfully constructed sentences, for instance syntactically ambiguous vs. unambiguous [49], or\ngrammatical vs. ungrammatical [63, 64].\nIn the scope of the present paper, we cannot draw any strong conclusion regarding l-IFG\non the basis of its ‘non-activation’.\n6 Conclusions\nIn this paper we have shown that the stochastic sequential processing paradigm is indeed a\npowerful formalism able to predict neurobiological correlates in areas belonging to the lan-\nguage processing network, also when applied to sub-lexical (phonemic) and syntactic (part of\nspeech) levels. Previous work has demonstrated that language processing can be characterized\nas a stochastic process computed on sequences of words, and that measures of stochastic per-\nplexity are good predictors of brain activity in language sensitive cortical areas.\nWord-based (lexical), part of speech-based and phoneme-based perplexity distinctively pre-\ndict activity in largely separated cortical networks in the temporal, inferior parietal and perisyl-\nvian cortex of subjects listening to naturalistic linguistic input.\nThese results appear to confirm the intuition that language is processed in parallel by dis-\ntinct networks sensitive to different sources of information, including at least the ones tested\nhere: phonological, lexical and syntactic.\nSupporting information\nS1 File.
