    "abstract": "Cognitive Warfare (CogWar) is another form of warfare where the goal is to exploit cognition facets to disrupt, undermine, influence or modify human decisions. Famous examples include &amp;ldquo;Operation Gidlock&amp;rdquo; meddling with the US 2016 election, and CogWar campaigns assisting the annexation of Crimea. As Large Language Model(LLM)-based applications expand, reaching more users and their cognitive states, stealth Malicious Cognitive Behavioral Tactics (MCBT) can be embedded in trusted application sessions to systematically profile, then alter, each individual&amp;rsquo;s cognition over time. Successful MCBT can create more cases like Snowden, mass shootings, or January6. This short-form paper discusses a novel MCBT threat model, a novel kill chain, and an on-going prototype for demonstration.",
