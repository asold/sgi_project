Understanding the neural circuits sup-\nporting the use and knowledge of tools is an important\ncomponent of the study of the modern human brain. Much neu-\nropsychological and neuroimaging evidence has identified sev-\neral brain regions in parietal, frontal, and temporal cortices that\nare associated with tool processing (\nDe Renzi et al., 1968; Gold-\nenberg and Hagmann, 1998; Rumiati et al., 2001; Johnson-Frey,\n2004; Lewis, 2006; Goldenberg and Spatt, 2009; Randerath et al.,\n2010; Buxbaum et al., 2014; Goldenberg, 2014; Hoeren et al.,\n2014; Orban and Caruana, 2014). Neuropsychological studies\nhave found that lesions to the left temporal lobe can lead to tool\nunderstanding impairment and lesions to the parietal lobe lead to\ntool use impairment (\nJohnson-Frey, 2004; Goldenberg and Spatt,\n2009; Buxbaum et al., 2014). A meta-analysis (Lewis, 2006)o f\nstudies using functional neuroimaging to investigate the activa-\ntion patterns associated with tool-processing tasks showed that\nthe tasks involving tools understanding primarily activated ven-\ntral regions, including fusiform gyrus (FFG), posterior middle\ntemporal gyrus (pMTG), and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG); tasks\ninvolving using tools activated dorsal regions including dorsolat-\neral premotor cortex (DLPMC), ventral premotor cortex\n(VPMC), IFG, inferior parietal lobule (IPL), and superior pari-\netal lobule (SPL), as well as pMTG.

Seminal evidence for the structural connectivity of the\ntool network was obtained by\nRamayya et al. (2010)and byHo-\neren et al. (2013)using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Both\nstudies tracked the pathways between predefined regions of in-\nterest (ROIs) implicated in tool processing and obtained distinct\nconnections between the ROIs.\nAlthough these studies have provided important insights re-\ngarding the structural network of tool processing, the functional\nrole of the tracts putatively involved in tool processing was only\ninferred on the basis of the presumed functions of the regions\nthey connected. However, the fact that there are white matter\n(WM) connections between these regions does not necessarily\nmean that they participate in tool processing: the connected gray\nmatter (GM) regions may participate in different processes asso-\nciated with tools, but the connections between them may not be\ndirectly relevant to those processes. In addition, the activation of\none or both GM regions connected by a WM tract might not be\nfunctionally necessary in tool processing. Therefore, direct exam-\nination of the causal role of WM pathways in tool processing\nbehavior is essential for definitive conclusions about the struc-\ntural connectivity of the tool knowledge network.\nThe present study aimed to reconstruct the structural network\ncrucial for tool processing using diffusion and structural imaging\ndata in healthy and brain-damaged patient populations.\nMaterials and Methods\nMethodology overview\nA flowchart of the experiments and analyses is shown inFigure 1. The\nmain idea is to map tool use and tool conceptual performance with WM\nintegrity. Given that our primary interest was to understand how specific\ntool-relevant GM regions are structurally connected to support tool pro-\ncessing, we examined tracts connecting GM ROIs by tractography using\nour own WM data with healthy individuals (\nFig. 1A). We then validated\nour findings through voxel-based symptom-mapping analyses, relating\nthe results to the WM tracts in a common template/Johns Hopkins Uni-\nversity (JHU) WM tractography atlas (\nHua et al., 2008; Schwartz et al.,\n2012; Fig. 1B). The first approach more directly elucidates the effects of\nWM connections between specific GM ROIs, which do not necessarily\nmatch fully with the template pathways (e.g., being a subsection of a large\npathway); the second approach provides a better understanding of the\nresults in the context of classically mapped WM pathways. More specif-\nFigure 1.

Neurosci., April 29, 2015 • 35(17):6822– 6835 • 6823\nically, in the main analysis, we first charted the WM fiber bundles be-\ntween tool-activated regions across the whole brain by performing\ndeterministic fiber tracking with DTI data in healthy individuals. To\ndetermine whether these potential WM tracts contribute to tool process-\ning, we performed a patient study with 86 individuals with brain damage\nand examined the relationship between the integrity of each of the iden-\ntified WM tracts and behavioral performance on tool processing. WM\ntract integrity was measured with both lesion percentage (structural im-\naging) and mean fractional anisotropy value (diffusion imaging). Both\nmeasures have their limitations and advantages: lesion measures do not\ncapture the integrity variations in the voxels without lesion; fractional\nanisotropy (FA) values may be misleading in voxels with crossing fibers.\nTo be conservative, we considered the conjunction results of these two\nmeasures. Behavioral performance was assessed by a tool use task and\nmultiple tasks involving tool concepts (oral picture naming, picture-\nassociative matching, and word-associative matching). Significant corre-\nlation between tract integrity and impairment in tool use or tool concept\ncomprehension, controlling for confounding variables, would indicate a\ncausal effect of the target tract in tool processing. In the voxel-based\nlesion-symptom mapping validation analysis, tool use or tool concept\nperformance of the 86 patients were first mapped with the integrity/\ndamage value of each voxel on the whole brain using voxel-based lesion-\nsymptom (VLSM) mapping (structural imaging;\nBates et al., 2003) and\nvoxel-based FA-symptom mapping (VFSM; diffusion imaging, see below\nfor details) approaches. The voxels that were statistically significant in\nVLSM and VFSM analyses were then overlaid onto the JHU WM trac-\ntography atlas. Finally, we assessed the degree to which the observed\ntracts are at least partly specific for tools by testing control tasks (intran-\nsitive actions as a control for tool use; animals and people as a control for\ntool concepts).\nParticipants\nBehavioral and imaging data were collected for a group of healthy sub-\njects and a group of brain-damaged participants, a similar cohort to that\nof another study by our group (\nHan et al., 2013a). All healthy participants\n(n /H1100549) and 68 of the 86 patients of the current study were included in\nthat previous study. The differences in subject inclusion were because\nsome participants completed behavioral tasks for only one of the two\nstudies. Identical testing procedures were used for the two groups of\nparticipants. Participants were all native Chinese speakers and had pro-\nvided written informed consent. The study was approved by the Institu-\ntional Review Board of the State Key Laboratory of Cognitive\nNeuroscience and Learning, Beijing Normal University.\nHealthy participants.Forty-nine healthy adults (26 males) in Beijing\nparticipated in the study. The mean age of the group was 50 years (SD/H11005\n11, range: 26 –72) and the mean formal education was 13 years (SD/H110054,\nrange: 6 –22). All subjects were right handed (\nOldfield, 1971), had nor-\nmal or corrected-to-normal vision and hearing, and no history of psy-\nchiatric or neurological disease. The Chinese version of the Mini-Mental\nState Examination (MMSE) (\nFolstein et al., 1975) was used to evaluate\nthe general cognitive state (mean/H1100528, SD/H110051, range: 24 –30). They were\npaid for their participation.\nPatients. Eighty-six brain-damaged patients (65 males) were recruited\nfor this study from the China Rehabilitation Research Center. We ad-\nopted the following inclusion criteria: had no previous brain injury; had\nno other neurological or psychiatric disease such as alcohol abuse or\nsevere depression; was at least 1 month post-onset (mean/H110056 months,\nSD /H1100511, range: 1– 86); and had enough language comprehension ability\nto understand task instructions. All were right handed. The majority\nsuffered from stroke (n /H1100574) and the others from traumatic brain injury\n(n /H1100512). Thirty-five patients had bilateral lesions, 33 had left hemisphere\nlesions, and 18 had right hemisphere lesions. The mean age was 45 years\n(SD /H1100513, range: 19 –76) and the mean formal education was 13 years\n(SD /H110053, range: 2–19). The mean score on MMSE was 21 (SD/H110058, range:\n0 –30). A comprehensive language screening adopting aphasia classifica-\ntion criteria in\nGao (1993)revealed 10 patients without signs of aphasia,\n15 with motor aphasia, 8 with sensory aphasia, 12 with anomia, 5 with\nconduction aphasia, 29 with global/mixed aphasia, and 5 with subcorti-\ncal aphasia, 2 with dyslexia or dysgraphia.\nBehavioral data collection\nEach participant was individually tested in multiple sessions in a quiet\nroom. Each session lasted/H110212 h with pauses for rest upon request.\nTool use task.This task included 10 common tools (scissors, brush, key,\nchopsticks, saw, broom, fan, iron, match, and glasses). Participants were\ngiven each tool in their nonparetic hand and were instructed to perform\nhow it is typically used (e.g., cutting). Their performance was recorded\nwith a digital video recorder and was later viewed and scored. Given the\ncommon difficulty in categorizing an action response as correct or error\ndue to variation in various aspects of the action, instead of the conven-\ntional binary coding, we first asked two naive independent raters to rate\non a 7-point scale how appropriate each tool use action was overall, with\nthe instructions to give 1 to “completely incorrect,” 7 to “completely\ncorrect,” and 4 to “somewhat correct.” They were first trained on eight\nsubjects, for which discrepant items were discussed together to reach\ncommon criteria. They then independently scored all responses, with\nhigh interrater agreement across ratings for all responses of patients (r /H11005\n0.90, p /H1102110\n/H1100230), and the average of the two raters’ scores was taken as the\nperformance score for each item. To better understand the nature of the\nerrors, we also performed response analyses closely followingBuxbaum\nand Saffran (2002)and Buxbaum et al. (2005, 2014), scoring each re-\nsponses as correct or error (1 or 0) along five dimensions: (1) content (the\ntarget gesture was substituted by another recognizable gesture); (2) hand\nposture (hand posture/grasp was unrecognizable, flagrantly incorrect, or\nonly transiently correct); (3) arm posture/trajectory (arm posture and/or\ntrajectory, shape of movement, were flagrantly incorrect or only tran-\nsiently correct); (4) amplitude (size of movement was clearly too large,\ntoo small, or transiently correct); and (5) timing/frequency (speed of\nmovement was flagrantly too fast or slow and the number of cycles of\nmovement was flagrantly too few or many). The average of the hand\nposture and arm/trajectory scores reflects postural accuracy and the av-\nerage of the amplitude and timing/frequency scores reflect kinematic\naccuracy. Four new coders were trained on the responses of four patients.\nAfter reaching high interrater reliability in percentage agreement (mean:\n96%, range: 93–100%) and Cohen’s\n/H9260value (mean: 0.91; range: 0.82–1),\nthey each scored about one-fourth of the remaining patients and healthy\nsubjects.\nNon-tool-use action imitation task.To test whether patients’ failures in\nthe tool use task may arise from impairment in producing actions in\ngeneral, participants performed an imitation task on non-tool actions.\nTen intransitive hand-related actions (e.g., salute, applaud) were per-\nformed by an actor and videotaped. Participants were instructed to imi-\ntate each action after watching the video. Recording and scoring\nprocedures were identical to those for the tool use task.\nTool concept tasks.Tool conceptual processing ability was assessed by\njointly considering performance on three tasks: oral picture naming,\npicture-associative matching, and word-associative matching. These\ntasks involve the conceptual component of the tool network but vary in\nthe modalities of input (verbal and nonverbal stimuli) and output (nam-\ning and button press) (see similar approach in\nJefferies et al., 2008;\nSchwartz et al., 2012; Wei et al., 2012; Han et al., 2013a). We used the\ncomposite score across these three tasks as the tool conceptual score. The\nrationale is that the composite of these three tasks would likely reflect\nthe common cognitive component (i.e., semantics) rather than task-\nspecific components (e.g., oral production, picture perception/recogni-\ntion, word recognition, or button press). A potential problem with this\napproach is that the composite score may be primarily driven by one or\ntwo tasks and as a result reflect some nonsemantic, task-specific input or\noutput process. To cope with this possibility, we adopted another ap-\nproach for convergence using principal component analysis (PCA) (\nJol-\nliffe, 2002) on two sets of tasks: one set included the three conceptual\ntasks and the other set included the latter tasks as well as two additional\ntool tasks (oral sound naming, six tool items; oral word reading, 20 tool\nnames) so as to maximize the variation in degree of reliance on various\nprocessing components. The weights of the conceptual component ex-\ntracted from different tasks were examined. There were 20 trials in the\noral picture-naming task and 10 in each of the associative matching tasks.\nIn the naming task, participants were visually presented a colored pho-\ntograph of a common tool (e.g., hammer) on a computer screen and were\n6824 • J. Neurosci., April 29, 2015• 35(17):6822– 6835 Bi et al. • Structural Network of Tool Processing\ninstructed to speak out its name. The first complete response was scored.\nThe two matching tasks had the same format as the Pyramids and Palm\nTrees Test (\nHoward and Patterson, 1992). For the picture version, each\ntrial contained the photographs of three tools on a touch screen arranged\nin an upright triangle. Participants judged which of the two bottom\nimages (e.g., spoon, ruler) was semantically closer to the top one (e.g.,\nchopstick) by touching the corresponding photograph on the screen. The\nword version was the same as the picture one, except that the pictures\nwere replaced with their written names. There was a 60 s response dead-\nline for each item in all three tasks. Responses were scored 1 if correct and\n0 if wrong or if no response was given within the time deadline. The\npicture task was tested before the word version; many other unrelated\ncognitive tasks intervened between them.\nNon-tool conceptual tasks.To evaluate the extent of specificity of tract\ndamage on tool conceptual processing performance, we performed par-\nallel conceptual tasks (oral picture naming, picture-associative matching,\nand word-associative matching) with two other object categories, ani-\nmals and persons. The same numbers of animal and people items as those\nused in the tool concept tasks were used. The animal category included\ncommon mammals, birds, insects, fish, reptiles, and amphibians. The\nperson category included photographs or names of famous people that\nare familiar to the Chinese population.\nBehavioral data preprocessing for patients\nBehavioral data correction.Because the patient group showed consider-\nable variation in demographic properties (e.g., age, sex, education level),\n“raw” rating scores (on tool use) or accuracy scores (on conceptual tasks)\nmight not meaningfully reflect the degree of deficit. We adopted a stan-\ndardization method proposed by\nCrawford and Garthwaite (2006)in\nwhich patients’ behavioral scores are corrected by considering the per-\nformance distribution in the healthy population and transforming each\npatient’s raw scores into standardized “t” scores. This method has been\ndescribed in detail in our recent studies (\nHan et al., 2013a; Han et al.,\n2013b). In brief, for each task, we first established a regression model on\nthe basis of the properties of the healthy control group, with the depen-\ndent variable being their rating or accuracy scores and the predictors\n(age, sex, and years of formal education). A predicted accuracy score for\neach patient was acquired by introducing his or her demographic infor-\nmation into the model, and it was used to generate a discrepancy value\n(Discrepancy\npatient) (i.e., observed accuracy/H11002predicted accuracy). A\ncorrected SE of estimate for each patient (SEpatient) was obtained. The\npatient’st-score was then computed:t-scorepatient /H11005Discrepancypatient/\nSEpatient). The t-scores for the three conceptual tasks were composited\ninto one conceptualt-score by first transforming thet-scores toz-scores\nand then averaging thez-scores on the three conceptual tasks for each\npatient.\nImaging data collection\nParticipants were scanned at the China Rehabilitation Research Center\nwith a 1.5 T GE Signa Excite MRI scanner. Three types of images were\nobtained: high-resolution 3D T1-weighted images, T2-weighted fluid\nattenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) images, and diffusion-weighted\nimages. The 3D images were acquired with T1-weighted 3D MP-RAGE\nsequence along sagittal orientation with the following parameters: matrix\nsize /H11005512 /H11003512, voxel size/H110050.49 /H110030.49 /H110030.70 mm\n3, repetition\ntime /H1100512.26 ms, echo time/H110054.2 ms, inversion time/H11005400 ms, field of\nview /H11005250 /H11003250 mm2, flip angle/H1100515°, slice number/H11005248 slices. The\nT2-weighted FLAIR images were obtained on the axial plane with param-\neters: matrix size/H11005512 /H11003512, voxel size/H110050.49 /H110030.49 /H110035m m3,\nrepetition time/H110058002 ms, echo time/H11005127.57 ms, inversion/H110052 s, field\nof view/H11005250 /H11003250 mm2, flip angle/H1100590°, slice number/H1100528 slices.\nDiffusion-weighted imaging had two separate scans with different diffu-\nsion weighting direction sets so that, in total, 32 directions were covered.\nThe parameters for the first acquisition were as follows: 15 diffusion\nweighting directions, matrix size/H11005128 /H11003128, voxel size /H110051.95 /H11003\n1.95 /H110032.6 mm\n3, repetition time/H1100513000 ms, echo time/H1100569.3 ms,\ninversion time/H110050 s, field of view/H11005250 /H11003250 mm2, flip angle/H1100590°,\nslice number/H1100553 slices. The other acquisition had the same parameters\nexcept that it included 17 different directions. The first two volumes were\nb0 volumes and the b-value of other volumes was 1000 s/mm2 in each\nacquisition. All the images except for T2-weighted FLAIR images were\nscanned twice to improve the quality of images.\nImaging data preprocessing\nStructural MRI data.We first coregistered 3D structural imaging data\nwith a trilinear interpolation method in SPM5 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.\nuk/spm/software/spm5) and then averaged them. The T2 FLAIR images\nwere coregistered and resliced to the native space of the averaged 3D\nimages. Two trained staff members manually drew each patient’s lesion\ncontour on the averaged 3D images slice by slice, visually referring to T2\nFLAIR images. The drawn lesions were checked by an experienced radi-\nologist. Each patient’s structural images were resliced into 1/H110031 /H110031\nmm\n3 voxel size and then semiautomatically normalized into Talairach\nspace via the “3D Volume Tools” in BrainVoyager QX version 2.0 (www.\nbrainvoyager.com) by marking anatomical landmarks (the anterior\ncommissure, the posterior commissure, the most anterior point, the\nmost posterior point, the superior point, the inferior point, the most\nright point, and the most left point of the cerebrum. Specifically, we used\nthe Advanced Normalization Tools software (ANTs,\nhttp://www.picsl.\nupenn.edu/ANTS/) to estimate the affine transformation between the\nnative and Talairach spaces, which was further applied to transform the\nlesion masks into the Talairach space with the “WarpImageMultiTrans-\nform” program. The lesion masks were then transformed into the Mon-\ntreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space.\nDiffusion MRI data.For the diffusion-weighted imaging data of each\nparticipant, we first merged each of the 15 directions and 17 directions\npaired sequences into one single 4D image. Then we preprocessed the\nimages with the PANDA pipeline (\nCui et al., 2013), which incorporates\nFSL (Smith et al., 2004), Pipeline System for Octave and Matlab (PSOM)\n(Bellec et al., 2012), Diffusion Toolkit (Wang et al., 2007), and MRIcron\n(Rorden et al., 2007). The preprocessing procedure included the follow-\ning: (1) BET, skull removal; (2) Eddycorrect, correction of eddy current\ndistortion; and (3) DTIFIT, build diffusion tensor models and obtain the\nFA maps. We then registered them with the FMRIB FA template in the\nMNI space using ANTs with a linear rigid affine transformation plus a\nnonlinear transformation. In the linear affine transform, one affine\ntransform txt file for each participant was obtained using ANTs, and then\nthe “WarpImageMultiTransform” program was executed to produce the\nFA map in MNI space. In nonlinear transform, a shell script “buildtem-\nplate” was used to obtain more fine-grained normalized FA map of each\nparticipant in MNI space.\nConstructing the tool structural network in healthy participants\nIn this step, we mapped whether there exist WM tracts between those GM\nregions that, in functional neuroimaging studies with healthy individu-\nals, have been shown to be consistently activated by tool processing tasks.\nTool-relevant GM region selection.To cover regions relevant for tool\nprocessing as comprehensively as possible, we adopted the regions re-\nported in the meta-analysis by\nLewis (2006), which systematically re-\nviewed 32 functional MRI (fMRI) and positron emission tomography\n(PET) studies covering a variety of tool processing tasks. In total, there\nwere 335 foci (Fig. 5 in that paper) distributed in bilateral DLPMC,\nbilateral FFG, bilateral IFG, bilateral IPL, left inferior temporal cortex\n(ITC), bilateral pMTG, bilateral SPL, and bilateral VPMC. The left ITC\ncluster and left pMTG cluster were very close and have often been con-\nsidered to be a common region involved in tool processing (\nBeauchamp\net al., 2002), so we did not include left ITC as a separate cluster in the\npresent study. Note that, although right IFG was not labeled inLewis’\n(2006) study, we included this cluster because it has been reported to be\nactivated by tool stimuli (Johnson-Frey et al., 2005; Fairhall and Cara-\nmazza, 2013). In total, 14 bilateral homologous regions were selected as\nthe set of tool-relevant GM regions. To obtain the best estimate of the\ncoordinates of these 14 regions, we averaged the coordinates of all acti-\nvation peak foci reported in\nLewis (2006)in each region (obtained from\nthe online supplementary materials link provided in the study). The\nresulting mean coordinates were converted to MNI space (\nFig. 1, Table\n1). Given that, with this procedure, most regions were connected into\ncontinuous clusters, we adopted the Automated Anatomical Labeling\nBi et al.• Structural Network of Tool Processing J. Neurosci., April 29, 2015 • 35(17):6822– 6835 • 6825\n(AAL) atlas (Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002), which parcelled the GM into\n90 anatomical regions, to segment the clusters into the regions corre-\nsponding to labels given in\nLewis (2006), including FFG, IFG, IPL, and\nSPL. Because DLPMC, VPMC, and pMTG did not have corresponding\nregions in AAL, we generated a premotor cortex mask (including precen-\ntral gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, and supplementary motor area in AAL\nlabels) and split it equally in half (inz-axis) into DLPMC and VPMC\nregions along thex-plane in standard space. Similarly, we split the AAL\nmiddle temporal gyrus evenly in y-axis into three regions along the\nz-plane, with the posterior section being defined as the pMTG region.\nWith the coordinates of the 14 GM regions obtained, we generated 14\nspheres with 15 mm radius in MNI space. These 14 masks were then\ntransformed back to the native diffusion space for each subject to serve as\nnodes for the tractography below. IFG sphere and VPMC sphere in both\nhemispheres had overlapping voxels and tractography was not con-\nducted between these two pairs. In total, 89 node mask pairs were\ndetermined.\nWM connections extracted from diffusion MRI tractography in healthy\nparticipants. For each healthy subject, the whole brain tracts were recon-\nstructed using the FACT tracking algorithm (\nMori et al., 1999). Specifi-\ncally, the fiber tracking was terminated when the angle between two\nconsecutive orientations was greater than a given threshold (45°) or\nwhen the FA value was smaller than a given threshold (0.20). Given that\nthe outcome of tractography is affected by the initial position of the seed\npoints within the voxel (\nCheng et al., 2012), 100 seeds were randomly\nselected within each voxel to avoid biases from initial seed positioning. If\nfibers seeding within a voxel in one node succeed in fiber tracking to\nanother node, that is, terminating in any voxel in the other node, then the\ntwo nodes were considered to be connected by this tracking path, with\nthe passing voxels identified. Therefore, for each node pair, for each\nsubject, we obtained a “tract mask” connecting the two nodes containing\nall passing voxels on any of the tracking paths between these two nodes.\nThis tract mask is referred to as the tract between the two nodes for this\nsubject.\nFor each pair of node masks, every tract of each subject was projected\nto the voxels in the native diffusion space, resulting in a voxel-based\nbinary map. The binary map was further transformed to the MNI space.\nThe tract maps of all subjects for this node pair were overlaid to generate\na count map in which the value of each voxel represented the number of\nsubjects who had fibers on it. The count map (n /H110220) was then thresh-\nolded using the AlphaSim correction method, with a correctedp /H110210.05\nat cluster level (150 – 4640 voxels, depending on the size/shape of the\ntract) andp /H110210.05 at voxel level (sign test). The voxel levelp /H110210.05 was\nobtained using a nonparametric sign test for each voxel in the (subject)\ncount map with the null hypothesis that there is no actual connection in\nthe 49 subjects. The clusters passing the threshold were masked as the\ntract mask between the two regions and were entered in the subsequent\nanalyses. This analysis was done for all node pairs (89 potential tracts)\nand 33 tracts passed the thresholds.\nTesting the effects of observed tracts in tool processing\nwith patients\nTo assess whether the observed tracts among the tool-relevant seeds have\ncausal effects on tool processing, we examined the extent to which lesions\nto these tracts led to tool processing impairment. Specifically, we corre-\nlated the integrity of each tract and behavioral performance across pa-\ntients separately for tool use and for tool comprehension tasks. For tract\nintegrity, we used two types of measures based on structural imaging and\ndiffusion imaging, respectively: with structural imaging, we measured\nthe percentage of damaged voxels (number of voxels with lesion divided\nby total number of voxels on the tract); with diffusion imaging, we cal-\nculated the mean FA value (averaging the FA values of all voxels in the\ntract). For each tract of interest, in separate analyses, we performed par-\ntial correlation analyses between the lesion percentages or mean FA val-\nues with tool behavioral scores across patients, with each patient’s whole\nlesion volume as covariate. For each of these analyses we adopted the\nthreshold of q /H110210.05 with false discovery rate (FDR) to correct for\nmultiple comparisons and we considered tracts showing significant ef-\nfects in both lesion percentage and FA analyses as important tracts.\nControlling for the influence of GM.Given that brain lesions rarely\naffect only WM while sparing the GM, it is important to understand\nwhether the effects of WM tracts in tool processing observed in the above\nanalyses could be fully accounted for by the effect of relevant GM lesions.\nWe performed partial correlation analyses to control for the contribution\nof GM effects, that is, calculated partial correlations between tract integ-\nrity measures (lesion percentage and mean FA values of each tract) and\ntool behavioral performance (use and comprehension scores) with lesion\npercentage on GM regions as covariate. We considered two types of\nmeasures for GM effects, in separate analyses: (1) the overall lesion vol-\nume in the whole brain GM mask and (2) the lesion volume in each of the\ntool-relevant GM regions. To generate a mask of the whole brain GM, we\nincluded voxels with a probability/H110220.40 in the SPM5 template, exclud-\ning the cerebellar regions in AAL template because of signal distortion in\nthe cerebellum. The GM areas sensitive to tool process were masked with\nthe 14 seeds that we used above, with each seed expanded into a 15-mm-\nradius sphere. Voxels within the spheres that landed outside of the whole\nbrain GM mask were excluded.\nControlling for the influence of etiology.In this study, we included pa-\ntients suffering from one of two kinds of brain injury, stroke and trau-\nmatic brain injury. We thus performed two further analyses to confirm\nthat our findings were not modulated by etiology. In one analysis, we\ncalculated partial correlation between tract integrity (lesion percentage\nand mean FA values of each tract) and tool use and comprehension\nscores, with etiology type and total lesion volume as covariates. In a\nsecond analysis, we performed correlation analyses between tract integ-\nrity and behavior in only the stroke patients (n /H1100574), with total lesion\nvolume as covariate.\nMapping tool-relevant tracts with template-based tracts.To understand\nhow the tracts we observed are related to the classical major WM path-\nways, we overlaid each of the tool use tracts or tool concept tracts ob-\ntained above onto the JHU WM tractography atlas (\nhttp://fsl.fmrib.ox.\nac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/Atlases) in FSL. The 25% threshold subtemplate was\nused, which contains 20 major tracts (Hua et al., 2008). The overlapping\npercentage of the observed tracts mask with each template tract was\ncomputed using the following formula: the number of common voxels\nbetween the observed tract mask and the template tract divided by the\nnumber of total voxels in the template tract (see\nTable 3).\nVLSM and VFSM.Figure 1B displays the procedure of this validation\nanalysis. We correlated the tool performance with the integrity of each\nvoxel (structural imaging or diffusion imaging) to obtain voxels that\ncontributed to tool processing. Specifically, for lesion structural images,\na VLSM analysis (\nBates et al., 2003; Rorden et al., 2007) was conducted on\nthe data of the 86 patients using the NPM (nonparametric mapping)\nprogram in MRIcroN. Voxels in which fewer than five patients had le-\nsions were excluded from the analysis. For each voxel entered in the\nanalysis, the patients were divided into the lesion group and the intact\ngroup. The behavioral performance indices (tool use scores and tool\nconceptual scores) were compared between these two groups while con-\ntrolling for total lesion volume.

To correct for multiple\ncomparisons, the significance threshold was set at FDR correctedq /H11021\n0.05. A whole-brain VLSMz-map for tool use or tool concept was then\nobtained. For DTI diffusion images, a VFSM analysis was carried out. FA\nvalues of each voxel in the whole brain were correlated with tool use\nscores and tool concept scores across patients, with total lesion volume as\na covariate (FDR-correctedq /H110210.05). A whole brain VFSMr-map for\ntool use or tool concept was obtained. The voxels reaching the threshold\nin both VLSM and VFSM analyses were considered to be important for\ntool processing (see\nFig. 4). We then overlaid these voxels onto the\nJHU-WM atlas (Hua et al., 2008). The tracts containing the voxels of tool\nuse or tool concept processing were considered to be necessary for tool\nuse or tool concept, respectively.\nTesting the functional specificity of tool-processing tracts\nIn this part of the project, we tested the degree of functional specificity of\nthose tracts that were found to be important for conceptual and use\nknowledge of tools. We asked two questions: (1) to what extent are the\nnetworks for tool use and tool concept processing dissociable? and (2) to\nwhat extent do the observed tool use and tool concept networks contrib-\nute to the processing of tools as opposed to general action production or\nconceptual processing?\nDissociation between tool use and conceptual processing.We performed\npartial correlation analyses between tract integrity (lesion percentage and\nmean FA values of each tract) and tool use scores, treating tool concept\nperformance scores as covariate. The results of these analyses reflect\ntracts that are important for tool use beyond tool comprehension. We\nalso performed partial correlation analyses between tract integrity (lesion\npercentage and mean FA values of each tract) and tool concept composite\nscores, treating tool use scores as covariate. The results of these anal-\nyses individuate the tracts that are important for tool concepts be-\nyond tool use.\nDissociation between tool use and non-tool-use action imitation.For\neach tract associated with tool use, we correlated its integrity measures\n(lesion percentage and mean FA values) with tool use scores across pa-\ntients, with scores on the intransitive action imitation task as a covariate.\nDissociation between tool conceptual processing and other object catego-\nries. For each tract that was found to be critical for tool concept process-\ning, we computed partial correlations between its integrity measures\n(lesion percentage and mean FA values) and tool concept composite\nscores, with conceptual composite scores for the animal and person cat-\negories as covariates.\nResults\nBehavioral performance\nThe raw behavioral performance of both healthy and patient\ngroups, as well as the correctedt scores of the patients, is pre-\nsented in\nTable 2. The patients performed significantly worse\nthan healthy subjects in all three tool concept tasks (raw accuracy:\noral picture naming:t /H110057.18, p /H110213*1 0\n/H1100210; picture-associative\nmatching: t /H110054.90, p /H110213*1 0/H110026; word-associative matching:t /H11005\n4.80, p /H110215*1 0 /H110026) and the tool use task (raw rating score:t /H11005\n9.43, p /H110211*1 0 /H1100215). Following Buxbaum et al.’s (2002, 2005,\n2014) scoring procedure, we found that, in the tool use task, the\npatients made more arm posture/trajectory errors [9% (the num-\nber of error items/that of total items) vs 2%,p /H110210.01], more\namplitude errors (8% vs 0%,p /H110210.01), and similar percentages\nof other types of errors (content errors: 1% vs 0.4%; hand posture\nerrors: 8% vs 7%; timing/frequency errors: 3% vs 2%;p /H110220.10)\nrelative to healthy subjects. To assess whether the results with this\nanalytic scoring scheme were consistent with those obtained with\nthe 1–7 point rating scheme, we first obtained a composite ana-\nlytic score by averaging the error scores hand posture/trajectory,\narm posture, amplitude, and timing/frequency (following\nBux-\nbaum and Saffran, 2002) for each item and correlated these scores\nwith the ones obtained with the 1–7 point rating scheme. The\nresulting correlation was highly significant (r /H110050.67, p /H110212*\n10\n/H1100212), indicating the general reliability across scoring methods.\nThe PCA analysis on the three tool conceptual tasks (oral picture\nnaming, word-associative matching, and picture-associative\nmatching) extracted one component that best captured (55%)\nthe variance across these tasks, with comparable loadings on the\ntasks: oral picture naming (0.69), word-associative matching\n(0.85), and picture-associative matching (0.68), likely reflecting\nthe conceptual component that is commonly shared across these\ntasks. For each subject, the conceptual PCA score was the sum of\nhis or her performance across the three tasks weighted by the\ncorresponding PCA component loading. The resulting tool con-\nceptual PCA score correlated highly with the composite score\ndescribed above (the average of the three conceptual tasks) across\npatients (r /H110050.99). The PCA analysis including the three concep-\ntual tasks and two additional tool tasks (oral sound naming, oral\nword reading) extracted two components that best captured\n(64%) the variance across the five tasks: one had high loadings on\nword-associative matching (0.80), oral picture naming (0.72),\noral sound naming (0.72), picture-associative matching (0.63),\nand minimal loading on oral word reading (0.03); the other com-\nponent had high loading on oral word reading (0.90) and low\nloading on word-associative matching (0.15), picture-associative\nmatching (0.05), oral sound naming (/H110020.46), and oral picture\nnaming (/H110020.32). Therefore, the first component likely reflects\nconceptual processing and the second probably reflects\northography-phonology-conversion processing. The tool con-\nceptual PCA score (component 1) on the 5 tasks again correlated\nhighly with the composite score in the original method (r /H11005\n0.97). For simplicity, we only used the composite score of tool\nconceptual processing in the following analyses.\nTool processing tracts obtained with tractography in\nhealthy participants\nWe selected 14 GM seed regions on the basis of a meta-analysis of\nprevious fMRI and PET studies of tool processing (\nFig. 2E, Table\n1) and tracked the WM fiber bundles between the seed regions in\n49 healthy individuals. That is, to estimate whether there existed\na WM tract between each seed pair, with theoretically 89 possible\nconnections in total (two connections, lIFG-lVPMC and rIFG-\nrVPMC, were not tested because the seed pairs had overlapping\nvoxels), we obtained 33 effective tracts reaching the threshold of\nAlphasim correction (cluster level:p /H110210.05; voxel level: sign test\np /H110210.05;\nFig. 2E, Table 3). The size of the tracts was 7515 mm3 on\naverage (SD: 6219 mm3, seeTable 3). The tracts were generally\nsymmetrical across hemispheres. There were 26 intrahemisphere\ntracts: 13 in the left hemisphere and 13 in the right hemisphere.\nTwelve were symmetric and appeared in both hemispheres:\nDLPMC-IFG, DLPMC-SPL, DLPMC-VPMC, FFG-pMTG, IFG-\nIPL, IFG-SPL, IPL-pMTG, IPL-SPL, IPL-VPMC, pMTG-SPL,\npMTG-VPMC, and SPL-VPMC.

The other three interhemisphere tracts\nwere lDLPMC-rVPMC, lIFG-rVPMC, and lVPMC-rIFG.\nNote that, although the ROIs have the same size (15 mm ra-\ndius spheres), the number of WM voxels in each ROI sphere\nvaried [under the threshold FA value/H110220.15 for the WM mask of\nour own 49 healthy subjects, WM voxel percentage range: 32–\n91%; across ROIs\n/H92732 (13) /H110057079, p /H110210.0001], which may lead to\ndifferent chances of tracking success. To determine whether the\n33 tracts were obtained simply because their corresponding ROIs\ncontained greater WM, we compared the WM size of the ROI\npairs with connecting tracts with the ROI pairs without connect-\ning tracts in our results. Specifically, for the two ROIs of each of\nthe obtained tracts, we computed the mean, minimum, and max-\nimum number of WM voxels of the pair. We also computed the\nsame measures of WM voxels for the ROI pairs for which no\ntracts were obtained.t tests comparing the number of WM voxels\nin the two types of ROIs revealed no significant differences for the\nROI-means or the ROI-min values of the two groups (p /H110220.30)\nand the opposite-to-predicted trend of the ROI-max values\n(with tracts pairs/H11021no tract pairs in WM size: 10381 vs 11178\nvoxels). Within the 33 obtained tracts, there was no significant\ncorrelation between the WM size of the ROIs and the size of\nthe tracts (R\nROI-mean /H110050.18; RROI-min /H110050.18; RROI-max /H110050.11;\np /H110220.30).\nEffects of observed tracts in tool processing with patients\nWe tested whether the observed tracts between the tool-activated\nseeds are functionally necessary for tool processing by correlating\ntract integrity (lesion percentage and mean FA values) and be-\nhavioral performance on tool use and tool concept tasks for the\n86 brain-damaged subjects.\nFigure 2.

The lesions were\ndistributed widely, covering most WM and GM areas, with most\npatients having lesions in insula and its surrounding WM tissues\n(\nFig. 2A). Although the mean FA map of the patients shows the\nbasic WM connectivity skeleton, the FA values were significantly\nreduced compared with those of the healthy adults (\nFig. 2B–D).\nWorth noting is that the number of patients with lesion on each tract\nvaried (\nTable 3), resulting in statistical power differences in our anal-\nyses.

The other eight tracts were damaged in\n/H1102130% of the patients. Note that the size of the tract (number of\nvoxels) did not correlate significantly with the chance of being le-\nsioned in our patients (number of patients with lesion on the tract)\nacross the 33 obtained tracts (r /H110050.28;p /H110050.11).\nThe results of the correlation analyses between tract integrity\nmeasures (lesion percentage and mean FA values) and tool be-\nhavioral performance for the 33 tracts are presented in\nFigure 3\nand Table 3. All analyses controlled for total lesion volume.\nFor tool use, the lesion percentage analysis revealed 11 tracts with\nlesion percentages that were significantly negatively correlated with\ntool use scores (partialr: /H110020.47 to/H110020.29, FDRq /H110210.05): 3 left fronto-\nparietal tracts (lIFG-lIPL, lIFG-lSPL, lIPL-lVPMC), 2 left frontotempo-\nral tract (lIFG-lpMTG, lpMTG-lVPMC), 2left intrafrontal tracts\n(lDLPMC-lIFG, lDLPMC-lVPMC), and 4 interhemisphere tracts\n(lIFG-rIFG, lIFG-rVPMC, lVPMC-rIFG, lVPMC-rVPMC).

When lesion per-\ncentage on the whole brain GM mask was included as a covariate,\nthe effects of the 3 tracts for tool use obtained in the above anal-\nyses were still significant in both the lesion analysis (partialr:\n/H110020.50 to /H110020.43, p /H110210.00004) and the FA analysis (partialr:\n0.37– 0.46,p /H110210.0006). Similarly, the effects of the 8 tool concept\ntracts also remained significant in both the lesion analysis (partial\nr: /H110020.54 to /H110020.41, p /H110210.0002) and the FA analysis (partialr:\n0.36 – 0.46,p /H110210.0007). In the second analysis, we considered the\neffects of the specific GM regions that were implicated in tool\nprocessing, that is, arbitrarily sized 15-mm-radius spheres (mi-\nnus the WM voxels) around the 14 tool-relevant regions that\nserved as seeds in our tracking analyses. When including patients’\nlesion percentages on each of these 14 seeds as covariates, the\ncorrelation between the integrity of the 3 tool use tracts and tool\nuse score remained significant in both the lesion analysis (partial\nr: /H110020.52 to/H110020.49, p /H110210.00002) and the FA analysis (partialr:\n0.38 – 0.43,p /H110210.002). The effects of the 8 tool concept tracts also\nremained significant in both the lesion analysis (partialr: /H110020.52\nto /H110020.41, p /H110210.0004) and the FA analysis (partialr: 0.37– 0.47,\np /H110210.002).\nControlling for the influence of etiology\nWe considered the effects of etiology in two kinds of analyses.\nFirst, when including etiology type in the partial correlation anal-\nyses as a covariate in addition to total lesion volume, the effects of\nthe 3 tool use tracts remained significant in both the lesion anal-\nysis (partialr: /H110020.43 to/H110020.35, p /H110210.0009) and the FA analysis\n(partial r: 0.28 – 0.36,p /H110210.02), as did the 8 tool concept tracts\n(lesion analysis: partialr: /H110020.54 to/H110020.39, p /H110210.0003; FA analy-\nsis: partialr: 0.37– 0.47,p /H110210.0006). Second, we performed the\nlesion and FA analyses in only the stroke patients controlling for\ntotal lesion volume, and all effects held up: tool use tracts lesion\nanalysis: partialr:\n/H110020.46 to/H110020.38, p /H110210.0009; FA analysis: partial\nr: 0.30 – 0.36;p /H110210.01; tool concept tracts lesion analysis: partial\nr: /H110020.56 to/H110020.41, p /H110210.0003; FA analysis: partialr: 0.36 – 0.48,\np /H110210.002.\nRelating the tool-relevant tracts with template-based major\nWM pathways\nTo understand the WM basis of tool processing in the context of\nmajor WM pathways that have been commonly established, we\ntested how our observed tracts are related to template-based ma-\njor WM pathways. The three tracts that were important for tool\nuse in the above analyses had common voxels with the left supe-\nrior longitudinal fasciculus (lSLF) of the JHU WM template. The\neight tool concept tracts in the above analyses had common vox-\nels with lSLF, left inferior frontooccipital fasciculus (lIFOF), left\nuncinate fasciculus (lUF), and minimally with left anterior tha-\nlamic radiation (lATR), left inferior longitudinal fasciculus\n(lILF), and left superior longitudinal fasciculus–temporal part\n(lSLFT) (\nTable 3).\nValidation with VLSM and VFSM approaches\nWe further performed VLSM (for structural images) and VFSM\n(for DTI diffusion images) analyses of tool use and tool concept\n(FDR correctedq /H110210.05; regressing out total lesion volume) and\noverlaid the results with the JHU WM template. The results are\ndisplayed in\nFigure 4. The VLSM results on tool use were strongly\nleft lateralized, encompassing the left insula and the left putamen\nand the underlying WM, indicating that lesions in these territo-\nries significantly associated with tool use deficits. The VFSM re-\nsults on the tool use task rendered the WM between the left\nputamen and the left frontal lobe. When the common voxels\nbetween the above VLSM and VFSM results (mask size: 252\nmm\n3) were overlaid on the JHU template, they had overlap with\nonly left SLF (0.08%, overlay percentage). For tool concepts, the\nVLSM results encompassed the left insula, putamen, IFG, and\nsuperior temporal gyrus, and their underlying WM; the VFSM\nresults involved the left WM underlying putamen, and right lat-\neral posterior temporal lobe. The common voxels of VLSM and\nVFSM results (mask size: 8729 mm\n3) overlapped with four left\ntracts of the JHU template, including lATR (11%), lIFOF (11%),\nlSLF (2%), and lUF (15%). Intriguingly, the VFSM results were\nweaker than the VLSM results overall. One possibility is that FA is\nonly one measure of tract integrity, that is, the degree of anisot-\nropy of diffusion processing, and there are other properties of a\ntract that are not reflected by FA but can be better captured by\nlesion status, thus rendering lesion a more sensitive measure for\ncurrent purposes.\nTesting the functional specificity of tool-processing tracts\nDissociation between tool use and tool concept processing\nTo reveal tracts that might contribute (partly) unique variables to\ntool use or tool concepts, we performed partial correlation anal-\nyses treating one type of behavioral task as of interest and the\nother as covariate. When partialling out tool concept composite\nscores, the effects of the 3 tool use tracts on tool use scores re-\nmained significant or marginally significant in both the lesion\nanalysis (partialr: /H110020.39 to/H110020.28, p /H110210.009) and the FA analysis\n(partial r: 0.21– 0.34,p /H110210.06). When factoring out tool use\nscores, the effects of the 8 tool concept tracts remained significant\nor marginally significant in both the lesion analysis (partialr:\n/H110020.47 to/H110020.24, p /H110210.02) and the FA analysis (partialr: 0.20 –\n0.40, p /H110210.07) (\nTable 4). These results suggest that the tracts\nindividuated in tool use and tool concept processing did not\nshare all of their underlying substrates/mechanisms.\nTo further consider whether such potential “dissociations”\nare due to a difference between motor versus nonmotor tasks, we\ntested the tool-specific variance of the tool use task (regressed out\nthe non-tool motor task) with the tool concept tasks. We ob-\ntained the residual of the tool use task regressing out the non-tool\nmotor control task (i.e., intransitive action imitation). We then\nexamined the correlation between this tool use residual and in-\ntegrity of the tool use relevant tracts with tool concept scores as a\ncovariate and vice versa. The pattern of results remained overall\nthe same, with effects of all tool concept tracts remaining signif-\nicant (p /H110210.006) and the effects of the tool use tracts significant\nor marginally significant in the lesion analyses (p /H110210.10) and\nnonsignificant but in the right direction in the FA analyses (p /H11005\n0.24 – 0.37). These results suggest that the different mechanisms\nunderlying tool use and concept components extend beyond the\nmotor versus nonmotor distinction.\nDissociation between tool use action and non-tool-use action\nTo investigate whether the effects of the 3 tool use-related tracts\nwere fully explained by their participation in action processing in\ngeneral, we correlated tool use scores and tract integrity values,\nwith patients’ scores on the intransitive action imitation task as a\ncovariate. After controlling for intransitive action imitation\nscores, tool use scores still significantly correlated with the lesion\npercentages (partialr: /H110020.45 to/H110020.35, p /H110210.0009) and the mean\nFA values (partialr: 0.26 – 0.30,p /H110210.02) of all 3 tracts (\nTable 4).\nBi et al.• Structural Network of Tool Processing J.

We\nperformed partial correlations between the integrity scores of\nthese tracts and tool concept composite scores while including\nconceptual composite scores for the two other semantic catego-\nries (animals and persons) as covariates. After controlling for\nconceptual performance for animals and persons, tool concept\ncomposite scores were marginally significantly correlated with\nthe lesion percentage of the lIFG-lIPL tract and the lSPL-lVPMC\ntracts (partial r /H11005/H110020.21, p /H110210.06; and for the other 5 tracts:\npartial r: /H110020.17 to/H110020.12, p /H110220.28).

That is, the\nlIFG-lIPL tract shows unique contributions for tool concept pro-\ncessing relative to at least two other types of concepts.\nDiscussion\nWe performed deterministic fiber tracking in healthy partici-\npants among 14 cortical regions that have consistently been\nshown to be activated by tool processing and obtained 33 WM\ntracts connecting these seeds. Three WM tracts connecting left\nfrontoparietal and intrafrontal regions, overlapping with left SLF,\nare functionally necessary for tool use. These tracts and five ad-\nditional left hemisphere tracts connecting frontal and temporal/\nparietal regions, overlapping with left IFOF, UF, ATR, and SLF,\nare necessary for normal tool concept processing. The effects of\nthe three tracts in tool use and those of eight tool concept tracts\ncould not be readily accounted for by each other. Whole-brain\nbased VLSM (and VFSM) analyses showed that the brain areas in\nwhich the lesion and lower FA values were associated with tool\ndeficits overlapped with major WM pathways in the JHU tem-\nplate: left SLF for tool use; left IFOF, UF, ATR, and SLF for tool\nconcepts. Our findings mapped out the WM structural networks\nthat are functionally necessary for tool use and tool concept pro-\ncessing, respectively.\nAlthough recent studies have also observed structural (\nRa-\nmayya et al., 2010; Hoeren et al., 2013) and functional (Yoo et al.,\n2013) connectivity between tool-relevant parietal and frontal\nlobe regions, we here show directly which of these tracts are in fact\nnecessary for different aspects of tool processing by assessing the\neffects of damage to these tracts on tool processing performance.\nOur analyses produced two major results: the anatomical net-\nwork for tools and the relative dissociation between the tool use\nand tool concept processing networks, as discussed below.\nTool use structural network\nWe observed that the WM connections between left IPL and left\nIFG and between left DLPMC and left IFG/VPMC (\nFig. 3, Table\n3) are indispensable for patients’ tool use ability. The extent of\ndamage to these tracts correlated with the degree of impairment\nin using tools. The tracts that we identified overlap with the an-\nterior/middle parts of left SLF, which has been shown to be in-\nvolved in tool use (\nRamayya et al., 2010; Hoeren et al., 2013) and\nvarious language functions such as syntactic processing (Wilson\net al., 2011 ), phonological encoding in speech production\n(Schwartz et al., 2012; Han et al., 2014), and verbal working\nmemory (Meyer et al., 2014). The present study further confirms\nthat this tract causally contributes to tool use and, more critically,\nidentifies the exact GM regions being connected by this pathway\nthat contribute to tool use.\nThese dorsal regions are commonly implicated in various as-\npects of action processing: IPL is known to be involved in the\nplanning of motor acts (\nJohnson-Frey et al., 2005), gesture pro-\nduction (Goldenberg and Spatt, 2009; Buxbaum et al., 2014), and\nthe use of objects or judgments of their manipulability (Kellen-\nbach et al., 2003; Rumiati et al., 2004; Boronat et al., 2005; Can-\nessa et al., 2008). Lesions to IPL have been shown to lead to\nideomotor apraxia, in which patients can name and understand\nthe function of a tool but do not know how to manipulate it\n(\nHeilman et al., 1982; Buxbaum and Saffran, 2002; Goldenberg\nand Spatt, 2009). The IFG and adjacent middle frontal gyrus\nregions are also implicated in action production and action un-\nderstanding (\nJohnson-Frey, 2004; Lewis, 2006; Goldenberg and\nSpatt, 2009; Buxbaum et al., 2014) and have been proposed to be\nrelevant for planning, controlling, or representing complex series\nof motor elements (Liberman and Mattingly, 1985). The premo-\ntor cortex is indispensable for producing motor acts, with the\ndorsal part assumed to be involved in converting knowledge\nabout a motor act into a motor command sequence (\nFink et al.,\n1999; Rumiati et al., 2004) and the ventral part in planning spe-\ncific arm and hand movements for execution, especially with\nobjects.\nThe error analyses further indicated that damage to the con-\nnection between IFG and IPL tended to be strongly associated\nwith kinematic errors and damage to intrafrontal connections\nwith postural errors. These analyses reveal the different contribu-\ntions of these tracts in various tool action components. Future\nstudies with more fine-grained tasks directly assessing these spe-\ncific tool use components are warranted.\nTool concept structural network\nEight left lateralized WM tracts between the temporal, frontal,\nand parietal regions were found to be important for tool compre-\nhension (\nFig. 3, Table 3). These tasks require knowledge of tool\nidentity, function, or verbal names. This tool comprehension\nnetwork subsumes the tracts in the tool use network and, in ad-\ndition, includes five other left hemisphere tracts: lpMTG-lIFG,\nlpMTG-lVPMC, lSPL-lIFG, lSPL-lVPMC, and lIPL-lVPMC.\nThese additional tracts overlaid with major WM pathways left\nanterior/middle IFOF, anterior UF, anterior ATR, and SLF, with\nthe former three having been implicated in conceptual process-\ning, independent of input and output modality (\nDuffau et al.,\n2005; Schwindt et al., 2013; de Zubicaray et al., 2011; Han et al.,\n2013a). The tract between pMTG and IPL also showed a strong\ntrend of being important for tool comprehension. The three tool-\nuse-related tracts might participate in tool comprehension by\nsupporting tool use- or action-related knowledge. Their role has\nbeen discussed above in the context of tool use and will not be\nreiterated here.\nOne hypothesis of the tool concept representation might be\nthat the connections among these regions bind together the ac-\ntion knowledge (frontal and parietal nodes) and the other aspects\nof tool knowledge, including shape knowledge in the fusiform\ngyrus and more abstract aspects of function knowledge in pMTG\nand IPL. It is worth noting that all of the tracts in the tool network\nwere also important for understanding animals and persons, for\nwhich the action system may be less central. Of significance is that\nthe tract between IPL and IFG showed greater importance in tool\ncomprehension than in animal and person comprehension,\nhighlighting the central role of this tract in the action system and\nin tool selectivity. Intriguingly, from the perspective of dual-\nroute models of language, the SLF has been strongly associated\nwith phonological and syntactic processing (see above) and not\nsemantics. The semantic tasks used in previous studies usually\nincluded a mixture of stimuli of various domains, which may\nhave obscured the role of the SLF in tool semantics. Therefore,\ndual-stream models of language (\nHickok and Poeppel, 2004) re-\nquire revision to accommodate the fact that the action aspects of\ntool semantics are likely to be carried by the “dorsal” language\npathway.\nRelationship between tool use and tool concept networks\nWe here observed partly overlapping networks for tool use and\ntool concepts: all three tool use tracts were also crucial for tool\ncomprehension, with the latter function involving additional\ntracts. Partial correlation analyses revealed that these tracts con-\ntribute to tool comprehension beyond the extent to which they\nare important for tool use. Partial correlations in the reverse di-\nBi et al.• Structural Network of Tool Processing J. Neurosci., April 29, 2015 • 35(17):6822– 6835 • 6833\nrection further suggest that their contribution to tool use cannot\nbe fully explained by the extent to which they represent tool\nconceptual knowledge. That is, tool use and tool conceptual process-\ning share some, but not all, underlying brain substrates and cognitive\nmechanisms. These tracts may transfer both manipulation-specific\ninformation and more abstract action information about tools, in-\nformation suitable for representing the causal relationship between\ntool objects and action goals and functions. In other words, the pat-\ntern of results reported here indicates that, whereas tool use infor-\nmation is an integral part of tool concepts, the two types of\ninformation are not reducible to each other.\nAn important caveat to consider is that in the patient analyses\nthe statistical power for each tract varied due to the unequal\nnumbers of patients having a lesion in a given tract. Therefore,\nwhen interpreting the effects of tract integrity on tool processing,\nespecially null results, it is important to consider these effects in\nthe light of lesion distributions. Our tool conceptual tasks had\nmore experimental items than the tool use task and thus may\nhave greater sensitivity to reveal subtle impairment severity dif-\nferences. Given that our tool use task involved actual tool use, it is\nunclear whether the tool use-relevant connections we found are\nalso important for other tool-related processing such as panto-\nmiming and imitation of tool use. Finally, DTI is an indirect\nmeasure of real fiber connections and is especially prone to errors\nin resolving fiber crossings (\nMori and van Zijl, 2002); therefore,\nconvergent evidence from other imaging techniques is war-\nranted. It is worth noting that, although FA values from diffusion\nimaging may be misleading in voxels with crossing fibers, in the\ntract integrity– behavior association analyses, the lesion volume\nmeasure from structural imaging is immune to this problem.\nTherefore, results using the combination of these two measures\nshould be taken with greater confidence.\nTo conclude, by tracking the WM structural pathways be-\ntween tool-relevant nodes and assessing directly the role of these\npathways in tool processing performance, we were able to iden-\ntify specific frontal-parietal WM tracts that are functionally nec-\nessary for tool use and tracts between the frontal, parietal, and\ntemporal regions that are functionally necessary for tool compre-\nhension. The lesion volume and FA values of these tracts signifi-\ncantly predict the severity of tool use and conceptual impairment.\nThese results underscore the causal role of these tracts in tool\nprocessing, constituting direct evidence for the anatomical basis\nof tool processing and specific apraxic or agnosic symptoms.\nReferences\nBates E, Wilson SM, Saygin AP, Dick F, Sereno MI, Knight RT, Dronkers NF\n(2003) Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping.
