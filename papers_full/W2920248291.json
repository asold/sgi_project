INTRODUCTION\nDue to penetration of renewable energy sources, the power\nconverter conﬁgurations are gaining more attraction in DC\nmicrogrid [1]. Owing to the low terminal voltage of power\nsources e.g. photovoltaic-cell (PV cell) and fuel-cell, high\ngain DC/DC converters with high efﬁciency are needed in DC\nFIGURE 1. Typical blocks of 400V DC microgrid system using proposed\nconverter.\nmicrogrid [2], [3]. Fig. 1 shows the typical block diagram of a\nDC microgrid system where DC-DC converter and proposed\nconﬁgurations are employed to uplift the low generated volt-\nage (12-48V) to an adequate voltage level (200-400V) [4].\nPractically, in present, the classical boost converter is not a\nsuitable solution to accomplish high step-up voltage gain due\nto the effect of the series resistance of capacitor and induc-\ntor, effective electromagnet interference (EMI), and high\nrating components and semiconductor devices. Additionally,\nthe reverse recovery of the diode problem is arising when\nthe converter operates at a high duty ratio to achieve high\nvoltage gain [5], [6]. In literature, to overcome these issues,\nseveral DC/DC converter conﬁgurations are recently pro-\nposed with high gain, high efﬁciency, and small volume etc.,\ne.g. [7], [8]. The isolated DC/DC converters e.g. push-pull,\nhalf and full bridge, ﬂyback, and forward converters are\nproposed in that high voltage gain is achieved by adjusting\nthe turn of the transformer [8]–[11]. Nonetheless, due to the\nleakage inductance of the transformer, these conﬁgurations\nare suffered from high power dissipation and a high spike\nin voltage across switches [4]. Therefore, to overcome these\nissues, additional active clamping technique and snubber cir-\ncuits are used [12], [13]. Nevertheless, high side driver and\nadditional control switches increase the cost of the circuitry.\nFurthermore, transformer core saturation is the other problem\nassociated with isolated converters. In [14], the interleaved\nconverter technique is employed to achieve high gain, reduce\nﬁlter size, and high efﬁciency using a reduced number of con-\ntrol switches. Nevertheless, complexity and drive circuitry is\nincreased due to the parallel connection of several converters.\nMoreover, high loss of energy, high voltage/current stress,\nand complex switching control logic are other drawbacks\nof this technique. Therefore, transformer-less DC/DC con-\nverters can be a solution where galvanic isolation is not\nnecessary and to achieve high voltage gain, reduced size\nand cost [15], [16]. The cascaded boost converters (CBC),\nquadratic boost converter (QBC), switched capacitor and\nswitched inductor integration with classical converter,\n36354 VOLUME 7, 2019\nM. Sagar Bhaskaret al.: High Gain Transformer-Less DDTM DC/DC Converter for DC Microgrid\nvoltage multiplier are utilized to achieve higher voltage\ngain [17]–[20]. However, a large number of reactive com-\nponents, semiconductor, switched capacitor and switched\ninductors stages increase the complexity and price of\nthe converter. In cascaded conﬁgurations, it is notewor-\nthy that the requirement of high rating components is\nincreased as the number of cascaded cells increases. More-\nover, complex driver circuitry is required to control several\nswitches [16], [21]. In [22], switch voltage stress is reduced\nby employing additional semiconductor devices and capac-\nitor in a quadruple converter conﬁguration. In [23], non-\nisolated coupled inductors based converter is proposed to\nachieve high efﬁciency and high voltage gain. Using this tech-\nniques energy recovery leakage inductance, high efﬁciency,\nhigh voltage, reduced switch stress is achieved by adjusting\nthe turns and coupling factor of coupled inductors. Neverthe-\nless, the large time is required for diode reverse recovery due\nto coupled inductor leakage inductance. Moreover, the com-\nplexity, size, and price of the converter circuitry are increased\ndue to the utilization of coupled inductors. In coupled induc-\ntor based converters, the high ripple in the input current is\na result of high turns ratio of coupled inductor. Therefore,\nthe stage of the input ﬁlter is needed to minimize current\nripples, which additionally increases the circuitry and cost of\nthe converter [24]. In [25], capacitor and diode circuitry i.e\nsimilar to the switched capacitor is utilized to achieve higher\nvoltage gain with a minimum number of inductor and control\nswitches. In this technique, the capacitors perform similarly\nto serially connected voltage sources. Later, in [26] active\nnetwork is combined with a switched capacitor with n cell\nstructure to increase the voltage gain. However, the use of\nconverter is restricted in practical application due to size,\nlow efﬁciency, high cost, and several components in each\ncell. Moreover, complex control drive circuitry, additional\ninductor and active control switch are the other drawbacks\nof this conﬁguration. V oltage-lift is another boosting tech-\nnique in which the voltage gain is increased by utilizing the\nstructure of capacitors and inductors, the technique is well\npresented in [27]. In this technique, inductors are serially\ndischarged with a charged capacitor to increase the voltage\nat the output side. The main beneﬁts of this structure are high\npower density, simple structure, less cost, minimum control\nswitches (thus, simple control), small output voltage ripple,\nand higher efﬁciency. In [28], three different converters are\nproposed in that when switches are turned ON and OFF\ninductors are charged and discharged in parallel and series,\nrespectively. Although using two switches and two inductors\nalong with additional capacitor and diodes, the voltage gain\nis sufﬁciently high. In [29], the new non-isolated converter\nis proposed to achieve high gain for microgrid application.\nThe voltage gain of this converter is adjusted by two duty\nratios. However, the voltage gain is limited even though using\nthree high voltage switches and two inductors. To increase the\nvoltage gain, the inductor structure is replaced with stages\nof the switched inductor [30]. However, the voltage gain is\nrestricted due to the use of several inductors and diodes.\nIn this structure, the energy is transfer to load via multi-\nple loops which degrade the efﬁciency and performance.\nMoreover, unequal inductances in the converter affect the\ncharacteristics of the converter.\nIn this paper, a new high gain Transformer-less Double-\nDuty-Triple-Mode (DDTM) converter is proposed for\nDC microgrid application. The proposed conﬁguration is\ncapable to provide high voltage gain with wide duty range\nand reduced switch voltage stress. Moreover, the converter\nis designed without using transformer, voltage multiplier,\nand multiple switched capacitor and switched inductor. The\nmain beneﬁts of the proposed conﬁguration are ﬂexibility in\nselection of duty ratios, the operating range is increased due\nto double duty ratio, and converter can be controlled in several\nways when the input side voltage is perturbed. Moreover,\nthe energy is transfer from input to output without using\nmultiple energy transfer loops which increases the efﬁciency\nand performance. Wide duty range and high voltage gain\nwith higher efﬁciency make proposed converter promising\ntopology for DC microgrid applications.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Power circuitry of the\nproposed converters is explained in section II. The steady\nstate analysis in CCM, DCM mode with boundary operating\ncondition is given in section II. The effect of non-ideality\nof inductors and semiconductor devices on voltage gain\nand efﬁciency of the proposed conﬁgurations is analyzed in\nsection III. The comparison of DDTM with existing convert-\ners is provided in section IV . The experimental investigation\nresults are provided in section V . The thorough discussion on\ncontrolling of the converter is provided as a future scope in\nsection VI. Finally, the conclusion is provided in section VII.\nFIGURE 2.

COMPARISON OF DDTM WITH EXISTING CONVERTER\nTable-1 tabulates the detail comparison of proposed DDTM\nconverter and existing converter. In [15], diode, capacitor and\nswitched inductor network is used with SEPIC and ZETA\nconverter to enhance the voltage gain. However, the voltage\ngain is not enhanced with high factor although using multiple\ncapacitors and switched inductor network. In [28], three dif-\nferent converter circuitries (converter-1,2,3) are proposed by\nusing two switches and diode-capacitor network. However,\nthere is only slight improvement in voltage gain compared to\nswitched inductor boost converter though using two inductor\nand capacitor network along with two switches. Moreover,\nthese converters operation is dependent on the single duty.\nTherefore, these conﬁgurations are not suitable solution to\nachieve higher voltage gain with wide range of duty ratio.\nCompared to the proposed converter, the converter mentioned\nin case 7 of table 1 utilizing one additional capacitor to lift\nthe voltage. If consider d =d1 +d2, theoretically, the gain\nof the converter of case 7 provides a higher voltage gain.\nHowever, in structure of the converter (case 7), extra clamping\n36362 VOLUME 7, 2019\nM.

DDTM converter comparison with recently proposed DC-DC converter for higher voltage.\nstage (capacitor and diode) is utilized to boost the voltage;\nit’s obvious utilization of additional reactive components\noffer higher gain. Moreover, practically increasing the reac-\ntive components and operate such a converter at a higher duty\nratio is not a feasible solution. Theoretically, using classical\nboost converter (case 1) and existing converter (case 2 to 7)\nwhich uses single duty ratio, very higher voltage gain can be\nattained at duty ratio closer to unity (inﬁnity at duty ratio =1).\nHowever, practically the converter suffer to achieve high step-\nup voltage gain due to the effect of the series resistance\nof capacitor and inductor, electromagnet interference (EMI),\nand need high rating components and semiconductor devices.\nMoreover, the switches of the converter (case 1 to 7 in table 1)\ncontinuously ON when operates at higher duty ratio. Hence\nthere is requirement of large heat sink.\nIn [29], high gain converter is proposed with two induc-\ntors, three switches and two types of duty ratios. However,\nthe converter provides a low voltage gain compared to pro-\nposed DDTM converter. Moreover, among converters dis-\ncussed in Table 1, the proposed DDTM converters provide\nhigh gain at given duty ratio and have higher duty range and\nrequired low voltage switches (except case 7; however, the\nconverter mentioned in case 7 is restricted by duty ratio). It is\nnoteworthy that the DDTM converter provides a option to\nadjust voltage gain by selecting appropriate duty ratios which\nis not possible from any converter (case 1 to 7) that is operated\non single duty ratio.\nV.

PULSE GENERATION SCHEME AND LOGIC\nFig. 16 depicts the block diagram of switching gate pulse\ngeneration scheme which is used to test the performance of\nthe proposed converter at different set of duty ratios. The\nswitching gate pulse generation scheme is designed by using\nmultiplexer, comparator, logic, constant, and counter blocks.\nThe waveform associated with pulse generation scheme is\nshown in Fig. 17. Two 8:1 multiplexers (Mux-1 and Mux-2)\nare used to select the value of duty ratio. Four different values\n(50%, 45%; 40%, 35%) are provided for the duty ratio d1 and\nthe required value is selected through Mux-1. Mux-2 is used\nto select the value of d1 +d2 from the given four different val-\nues (85%, 80%; 75%, 70%). Using counter block, sawtooth\ncarrier waveform is generated and compared with output of\nMux-1 to generate switching gate pulses (A in Fig. 17) for\nswitches S1 and S2. The output of Mux-2 is compared with\ngenerated sawtooth carrier to generate pulse with duty ratio\nd1 +d2 (C in Fig. 17). Finally, the waveform A is XOR with\nwaveform C to generate pulse (B in Fig. 17) for switch S3.\nThe 50kHz switching pulses with different 7 sets of duty\nratios (d 1 = 50%, d2 = 35% (typical set); d1 = 45%,\nd2 = 35%; d1 = 40%, d2 = 35%; d1 = 35%, d2 =\n35%; d1 = 35%, d2 = 35%; d1 = 35%, d 2 = 40%;\nd1 = 35%, d2 = 45%; d1 = 35%, d2 = 50%) are\nFIGURE 17. Waveform associated with pulse generation scheme.\ngenerated using FPGA in order to investigate the effect duty\nratios on voltage gain, performance, and efﬁciency of the\nDDTM converter. According to logic, switches S1 and S2\nare turned ON with same switching pulse whereas switch S3\nis turned ON when switches S1 and S2 are turned OFF.\nTherefore, in mode I, switches S1, S2, and S3 are turned ON,\nON, OFF, respectively. In mode II, switches S1, S2, and S3\nare turned OFF, OFF, ON, respectively. In mode-III; all the\nswitches S1, S2, S3 are turned OFF.\n36364 VOLUME 7, 2019\nM.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AT TYPICAL DUTY RATIO\nThe above discussed pulse generation scheme is utilized to\ngenerate two gate pulses; one for switch S1 and S2 with duty\nratio 50% (d 1), and second for switch S3 with delay 50% of\nTS (d1), and duty ratio 35% (d 2).\nFig. 18(a) shows experimental observed waveforms of\ninput, output voltage (v 1, v2) and input, output current\n(i1, i2). The observed average values of input voltage (V 1),\noutput voltage (V 2), input current (I 1), and output cur-\nrent (I 2) is 38.2V , 400.32V , 1.24A, 13.61A, respectively.\nFig. 18(b) shows experimental observed waveforms of induc-\ntor L1 and L2 (iL1 and iL2) currents along with input, output\nvoltage (v 1, v2). The observed average value of inductor L1\ncurrent (I L1), inductor L2 current (I L2) is 9.23A and 9.17A,\nrespectively. It is clearly visible that both inductors L1 and L2\nare charged in mode I and mode II. In Fig. 18(b), it is prac-\ntically seen that the magnetizing angles for both inductors in\nmode II are nearly half of the magnetizing angles for both\ninductors in mode I (i.e αI\n1 =2αII\n1 =αI\n2 =2αII\n2 ) which\nis expected according to theory. It is noteworthy that both\nthe inductors are charging with same magnetizing angles\n(i.e αI\n1 =αI\n2 and αII\n1 =αII\n2 ). It is clearly visible that both\ninductors L1 and L2 are discharged in mode III with same\ndemagnetizing angle (i.e βIII\n1 =βIII\n2 ).\nFig. 18(c) shows experimental observed waveforms of\ninput current (i 1), output voltage (v 2), inductor L1 and L2\ncurrent (iL1 and iL2). It is clearly visible that the both inductor\ncurrents (i L1 and iL2) in mode II and III are same as input\ncurrent. In starting mode I, the transient current observed in\nthe input current due to charging of capacitor C1 as shown\nin Fig. 18(c). Fig. 18(d) shows experimental observed wave-\nforms of capacitor C1 and C2 voltages along with inductor\nL1 and L2 (iL1 and iL2) currents. The observed value of\ncapacitor C1 voltage (V C1), capacitor C2 voltage (V C2) is\n37.7V , and 400.33V , respectively. It is notable that the voltage\nacross capacitor C1 is nearly equal to input and voltage across\ncapacitor C2 is equal to output voltage with is expected.\nFig. 18(e) shows experimental observed waveforms of volt-\nage across switches S1, S2 and S3 along with inductor L1\ncurrent. The total average voltage across switch S1 is 38.07V .\nThe total average voltage across switch S2 is 39.4V . The\ntotal average voltage across switches S3+diode D (VAB) is\n38.39V , respectively. The voltage across diode D1 and D2,\ninput current and output voltage is shown in Fig. 18(f). The\ntotal average voltage across diode D1 and D2 is −38.2V and\n−326.9V , respectively. It is observed that the diodeD1 and D2\nare forwards biased during mode I and III, respectively.\nD. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS WITH\nREGULATION IN DUTY RATIO\nAt constant load R =320, duty ratio d2 =35%, and input\nvoltage 38V; the duty ratio d1 is regulated from 50 to 35%\nwith the interval of 5% in order to investigate effect duty\nratio on voltage gain, performance, and efﬁciency of the\nDDTM converter.

Based on the experimental\ninvestigation, the efﬁciency graphs are plots by considering\nthe regulation of duty ratio. Fig. 21(a) shows the plot of\nefﬁciency versus power of DDTM converter where duty d1 is\nvarying and d2 is constant (35%). Fig. 21(b) shows the plot of\nefﬁciency versus power of DDTM converter where duty d2 is\nvarying and d1 is constant (35%). Highest 95.47% efﬁciency\nis reported at d1 =50% and d2 =35%. After conducting\nseveral tests, 93.43% is observed average efﬁciency of\nDDTM converter.\nVI. FUTURE SCOPE-DIFFERENT CONTROL SCHEMES\nThe output voltage of proposed DDTM converter is based\non the two duty ratios d1 and d2. Owing to advantages of\ntwo duty ratios, when the voltage changed the operation\nof proposed converter can be controlled in three possible\nways 1) ﬁxed duty ratio d1 and variation in duty ratio d2,\n2) variation in duty ratio d1 and ﬁxed duty ratio d2, and 3)\nvariation in both duty ratio d1 and d2.\nA. CONTROL SCHEME-1: FIXED DUTY RATIO d1 AND\nVARIATION IN DUTY RATIO d2\nIn this scheme, during perturbations of input voltage V1, the\noutput voltage V2 is controlled at constant value by variation\nin duty ratio d2. The pulses associated this operation is shown\nin Fig. 22, where duty ratio d2 is changed by +/−1d2 to\nachieve required output voltage V2. The value of +/−1d2 is\nbased on the perturbation in input voltage −/+1V1.\nB. CONTROL SCHEME-2: FIXED DUTY RATIO d2 AND\nVARIATION IN DUTY RATIO d1\nIn this scheme, during perturbations of input voltage V1, the\noutput voltage V2 is controlled at constant value by variation\nin duty ratio d1. The pulses associated this operation is shown\nin Fig. 23, where duty ratio d1 is changed by +/−1d1\nto achieve required output voltage V2. It is noticeable that\nthe duty ratio d2 is constant; however position is changed\naccording to new duty ratio d1. The value of +/−1d1 is\nbased on the perturbation in input voltage −/+1V1.\n36366 VOLUME 7, 2019\nM. Sagar Bhaskaret al.: High Gain Transformer-Less DDTM DC/DC Converter for DC Microgrid\nFIGURE 20.

CONTROL SCHEME-3: VARIATION IN BOTH DUTY\nRATIOS d1 AND d2\nIn this scheme, during perturbations of input voltage V1, the\noutput voltage V2 is controlled at constant value by vari-\nation in both duty ratios d1 and d2. The pulses associated\nFIGURE 22. Gate pulses during control scheme-1 (A: gate pulse of\nswitches S1 and S2, B: changed in gate pulse of switchS3 when input\nvoltage is increased, C: changed in gate pulse for switchS3 when input\nvoltage is reduced).\nthis operation is shown in Fig. 24, where duty ratios d1\nand d2 are changed by +/−1d1 and +/−1d2 to achieve\nrequired output voltage V2. It is noticeable that the duty\nratios d1 and d2 is varied as well as the position of duty\nratio d2 is changed according to new duty ratio d1. The\nvalue of +/−1d1 and +/−1d2 is based on the perturbation\nin input voltage −/+1V1. For this scheme, variation of\nboth duty ratios d1 and d2 can be possible in six different\nways (given in Table-3). It is noticeable that increment or\ndecrement in one duty ratio and decrement or increment in\nanother duty ratio also possible to achieved desired output\nvoltage.\nVOLUME 7, 2019 36367\nM. Sagar Bhaskaret al.: High Gain Transformer-Less DDTM DC/DC Converter for DC Microgrid\nTABLE 3. Summery of possible control scheme during perturbation of input voltage.\nFIGURE 23. Gate pulses during control scheme-2 (A: changed in gate\npulse of switchS1 and S2 when input voltage is increased, B: changed in\ngate pulse of switchS1 and S2 when input voltage is reduced, C: changed\nin position of gate pulse of switchS3 when input voltage is increased,\nD: changed in position of gate pulse of switchS3 when input voltage is\nreduced).\nThe control scheme-1 and scheme-2 can be called half\nor independent control schemes. Since during perturbation\nof input voltage v1, only one duty ratio is varied to achieve\nrequired output voltage V2 and the value of another duty ratio\nis ﬁxed throughout the operations (d 1 is ﬁxed in scheme-1\nand d2 is ﬁxed in scheme-2). The control scheme-3 is called\nfull or dependent control schemes. During perturbation of\ninput voltage v1, the value of both duty ratio d1 and d2\nis varied and dependent on each other throughout the\noperation.\nDue to high voltage gain, unidirectional power ﬂow, wide\nduty range operation, and ﬂexibility in control and selection\nof duty ratio, the proposed converter is more suitable and\ngood choice for 400V DC microgrid PV application.\nAdditional advantages could be a scenario in that, in future\nthe proposed converter provides an option that one may use\none duty ratio for MPPT tracking and another to control\noutput voltage.\nFIGURE 24. Gate pulses during control scheme-3 (A: changed in gate\npulse of switchS1 and S2 when input voltage is increased, B: changed in\ngate pulse of switchS1 and S2 when input voltage is reduced, C: changed\nin position and duty ratio of gate pulse of switchS3 when input voltage is\nincreased, D: changed in position and duty ratio of gate pulse of\nswitch S3 when input voltage is reduced).\nVII. CONCLUSION\nA new Double-Duty-Triple-Mode (DDTM) converter is pro-\nposed with high voltage gain for DC microgrid application.\nThe proposed converter topology is transformer-less and has\nwide duty ratio range. The higher voltage gain is achieved\nwithout employing any complex techniques like multiplier,\ncoupled inductor, and multiple lifting techniques. The operat-\ning principle, CCM and DCM characteristics waveform, and\nefﬁciency analysis is presented in detail. The main advan-\ntages of the DDTM converter is that the voltage gain is\nadjusted by controlling two different duty ratios and thus,\noffers wide operating duty range which is not possible\nthrough any single switch converter. The DDTM converter is\ncompared with existing topologies and it is noteworthy that\nthe proposed converter provides a good choice to attain high\nvoltage with reduced voltage stress on semiconductor and\ncomponent count. The future scope and advantages of two\nduty ratios in proposed circuit and its control is discussed.\nThe experimental results are presented which validate the\nperformance and theoretical analysis.\n36368 VOLUME 7, 2019\nM.
