Introduction\nApplying resonant DC-DC converters can help to reduce\nthe switching losses and /or to raise the switching frequency\nof the power switches. On this account the overall sys-\ntem size in many industrial applications, e.g., telecom power\nsupplies\n(1), high voltage generators (2) or inductive heating (3)\ncould be reduced and the power density could be increased.\nEspecially, the series-parallel resonant converter, Fig. 1, is a\npromising converter structure since it combines the advan-\ntages of the series resonant converter and the parallel res-\nonant converter. On the one hand the resonant current de-\ncreases with the decrease of the load and the converter can\nbe regulated at no load and on the other hand good part-load\neﬃciency can be achieved\n(4) (5). Furthermore, the converter is\nnaturally short circuit proof.\nDuring the design of a resonant converter one has to\nFig. 1. Series-parallel resonant DC-DC converter\n568 IEEJ Trans. IA, Vol.126, No.5, 2006\nAnalytic Model for Resonant Converter Design and Optimization\ndetermine for example the values of the resonant circuit el-\nements (CS , LS and CP), the turns ratio and the number of\nprimary turns so that the design constraints (temperature rise,\noperating frequency. . . ) are met for the given speciﬁcations\n(input voltage, output power, load. . . ). In order to ﬁnd the\nvalues for the components which lead to an optimal design\n(optimal with respect to the given design aim—e.g. mini-\nmal converter volume, maximal eﬃciency, minimal costs. . . )\none needs an automatic optimisation procedure. A possi-\nble ﬂowchart for such an optimisation procedure is shown\nin Fig. 2. First, the speciﬁcations of the application and the\ninitial values of the resonant circuit elements are fed into the\nanalytic model of the resonant converter. Within the model\nthe operating frequency, all voltages and currents of the con-\nverter inclusive phase shift and also the ﬂux values in the\ntransformer are computed. With this information the design\nof the transformer is optimised in an inner optimisation loop\n(cf. Fig. 2) so that the resulting transformer volume is min-\nimal. In parallel the volume of the heatsink for the power\nsemiconductors is calculated using the semiconductor losses\nand an analytic thermal heatsink model. The resulting vol-\numes are fed into the global optimisation algorithm which\nvaries the resonant circuit elements, the cooling conditions\nand the parameters of the semiconductors until a minimal\noverall converter volume is obtained.\nFig. 2. Workﬂow of system optimisation procedure\n(a) (b)\nFig. 3. (a) Measured converter output voltage VAB, primary current IP, output current IOut\nand parallel capacitor voltage VCP in continuous capacitor voltage mode CCV (ligth load—\nVIN =320, UOﬀ =0, RL =1.7 Ω). (b) The same waveforms as for (a) but for discontinuous\ncapacitor voltage mode (heavy load— RL =0.2 Ω)\nFor the described optimisation procedure an accurate\nmodel for the resonant converter is needed, which must not\nbe too complicated in order to limit the computation time.\nThe used model is based on the extended fundamental fre-\nquency analysis which is explained in principle in the fol-\nlowing.\nThe resonant circuit of the series-parallel resonant con-\nverter is fed by a square wave input voltage V\nAB which usu-\nally has a varying frequency and duty cycle. In order to\nachieve a ZVS condition in one leg of the converter and to\nprevent a MOSFET from a hard turn-oﬀof a diode the oper-\nating frequency of the converter has to be always above the\nresonant frequency of the resonant circuit which is dependent\non the load of the converter\n(2). Furthermore, the amplitude\nof the resonant current for operation at light load must be\nlarge enough to discharge /charge the output capacitances of\nthe MOSFETs. This could be always achieved by a proper\nchoice of the value of the parallel capacitor C\nP.\nThe square wave input voltage is ﬁltered by the resonant\ncircuit so that the current in the resonant components is al-\nmost sinusoidal as shown in Fig. 3(a). Neglecting the small\nharmonics of the resonant current the analytic calculation of\nthe resonant converter can be done by simple AC circuit anal-\nysis where the square wave input voltage V\nAB, the square\nwave rectiﬁer input currentIR and the distorted voltage across\nthe parallel capacitor VCP are represented by their respec-\ntive fundamental components. This method was proposed in\nRef. (5).\nUnder heavy load conditions, however, the voltage wave-\nform of the parallel capacitor VCP is clamped by the out-\nput current to zero for a certain period of time, period β\nin Fig. 6(b), which leads to a discontinuous and very dis-\ntorted parallel capacitor voltage V\nCP . Under these condi-\ntions the standard fundamental frequency analysis is inac-\ncurate. Therefore, the authors of Ref. (6) proposed an ex-\ntended fundamental frequency analysis which accounts for\nthe discontinuous capacitor voltage under heavy load condi-\ntions. This method uses two diﬀerent models of the resonant\nconverter—one for the continuous capacitor voltage mode\n(CCV) and one for the discontinuous capacitor voltage mode\n(DCV) and yields quite accurate results for all operating con-\nditions (light, part, and heavy load). The equations of this\n࿦ Dɼ126ר5ɼ2006 ೥ 569\nmodel are based on the assumption of a negligible ripple of\nthe output current.\nWith this analytic model the design of the resonant circuit\nincluding the voltage transfer ratio of the transformer could\nbe performed quite accurately. The design of the transformer\nitself, however, is still elaborate since the current respectively\nvoltage waveforms and their phase relation for the primary\nand secondary windings are required in order to be able to\ncalculate the ﬂux distribution within the core. This is partic-\nularly true if the series inductance is realised by the leakage\ninductance of the transformer which is increased by a mag-\nnetic shunt\n(7)–(10). Depending on the winding geometry /core\nstructure the three ﬂux parts—primary linked ﬂux, secondary\nlinked ﬂux and leakage ﬂux—add or subtract in the di ﬀer-\nent legs of the transformer where the absolute values and the\nphase relations of the ﬂuxes have to be considered. Espe-\ncially in the magnetic shunt the phase relations between the\ndiﬀerent ﬂux parts must be considered in order to design the\nmagnetic device properly.\nFor this reason the analytic model proposed in Ref. (6) is\nextended in this paper by a magnetic reluctance model of the\ntransformer including the series inductance which is realised\nby the leakage inductance of the transformer. In Fig. 5 the\nseries-parallel resonant converter with the reluctance model\nis shown. The presented reluctance model represents a sim-\nple E-core transformer where the windings are placed on the\ntwo outer legs of the core and the magnetic shunt /leakage\npath is implemented by the centre leg (Fig. 4) but basically\nevery core geometry and winding structure could be mod-\nelled in this way. The series inductance is controlled by the\nair gap in the centre leg. The derivation of the reluctance\nmodel is shortly presented in section 2 before the analytic\nequations for the series-parallel resonant circuit including the\nreluctance model are presented in section 3.\nThere, the equations of Ref. (6) are also extended for an\noperation mode where one leg of the converter is always\nswitched at the zero crossing of the resonant current I\nP\n(Fig. 7). This is a known method to reduce the switching\nlosses of the converter. Furthermore, the control of the out-\nput voltage/current by the duty cycle and the switching fre-\nquency is described by the extended set of equations which\nare presented in section 3.\nAfter the derivation of the model the analytic results are\nvalidated by circuit simulations using SIMPLORER\nTM and\nmeasurements on di ﬀerent prototypes. The results of the\ncomparison and the discussion are presented in section 4\nwhere also some results of the automatic optimisation proce-\ndure are presented. Finally, a conclusion and topics of future\nresearch are given in section 5.\n2. Magnetic Circuit Model\nIn the following a short summary of magnetic circuit mod-\nels based on Ref. (11) and the derivation of the equations\nwhich are applied in the calculations in section 3 is given.\nBy means of magnetic circuit models Ampere’s law is sim-\npliﬁed so that the line and surface integral do not have to be\nevaluated in order to ﬁnd the ﬂux distribution within the mag-\nnetic core. This simpliﬁcation is based on the following two\nassumptions. Firstly, the absolute value of the magnetic ﬁeld\n⃗H is constant in a given volume and secondly, the direction\nof the magnetic ﬁeld ⃗H is aligned with the direction of the\npath of integration.\nWith this assumptions Ampere’s law simpliﬁes to\n∮\nl\n⃗H ·d⃗l =\n/iintegdisplay\nS\n⃗J ·d⃗s ⇒ H ·l =N ·I.······ (1)\nApplying the relationship between the ﬂux density B and the\nmagnetic ﬁeld and the deﬁnition of the ﬂux yields\n⃗B =µ0 ·µr ·⃗H\nΦ=B ·Ae\n}\nΦ· l\nµ·Ae\n=Φ·ℜ=N ·I.\n···················· (2)\nThe quantity ℜis referred to as the magnetic reluctance\n(of the path l) and the product N ·I is known as the mag-\nneto motive force (mmf). Equation (2) represents Ohm’s law\nfor magnetic circuits which is the magnetic analogue to the\nOhm’s law for electric circuits: R ·I =V, i.e. the ﬂux corre-\nsponds to the current and the mmf to the voltage. With this\nequation and above mentioned assumptions also Kirchhoﬀ’s\nvoltage law (VL) and current law (CL) can be applied to the\nmagnetic circuit.\nVL : N ·I =Φ·(ℜ\n1ℜ2 ···ℜn) (for a given path)\nCL : Φ1 +Φ2 +···Φn =0 (for a given path)\n···················· (3)\nThus, by solving the system equation of the magnetic circuit\nthe ﬂux distribution in the core can be calculated. The appli-\ncation of Faraday’s law then leads to the induced voltage\nV =dΨ\ndt =N ·dΦ\ndt .····························· (4)\nAssuming that the ﬂux varies sinusoidally with time (4) can\nbe rewritten as\nV =j ·ω·Φ.··································· (5)\nIn (5) V is the complex voltage vector and Φis the complex\nvector of the magnetic ﬂux.\nThe above mentioned assumptions for applying mag-\nnetic circuit theory are approximately fulﬁlled in regions\nof high permeability (e.g. ferrite core) if, among other\nthings, the skin eﬀect of magnetic ﬁelds is neglected for HF-\napplications. Usually, in air gaps the magnitude of the mag-\nnetic ﬁeld is not constant over the cross section because of\nfringing ﬂux. For calculating the magnetic reluctance of air\ngaps empirical and FEM-based models\n(12)–(14) have been pro-\nposed. Here the ﬂux density/exact magnetic ﬁeld distribution\nis not important (no losses are generated in the gap) but only\nthe overall magnetic reluctance seen by the ﬂux is needed for\nthe calculations.\nIn principle, it is possible to model the magnetic device\nvery accurately with magnetic reluctances (with an increas-\ning number of modelled magnetic paths) but usually a quite\nsimple model is enough for getting reasonably exact results.\nIn Fig. 4(a) an E-core with two windings on its outer legs\nand the deﬁnition of the directions for the quantities is given.\nWith this winding structure the centre leg carries the leakage\nﬂux (Φ\nP −ΦS ) and the leakage inductance is adjusted to the\n570 IEEJ Trans.

Below, in Fig. 4(b),\nthe appropriate magnetic circuit model is given for sinusoidal\nﬂuxes.\nApplying the magnetic analogue of Kirchho ﬀ’s voltage\nlaw, (3), to the two loops of the magnetic circuit in Fig. 4(b)\nyields the following two equations\nN\nPIP =ℜM1ΦP +ℜσ·(ΦP −ΦS )\nNS IS =−(ℜM2ΦS +ℜσ·(ΦS −ΦP))\n}\n········· (6)\nSolving these equations for the ﬂux values and using U =\nN ·dΦ/dt =L·dI/dt leads to the following relations between\nthe magnetic reluctances and the inductances.\nL1 = N2\nP ·(ℜM2 +ℜσ)\nℜM1ℜM2 +ℜM1ℜσ+ℜσℜM2\nL2 = N2\nS ·(ℜM1 +ℜσ)\nℜM1ℜM2 +ℜM1ℜσ+ℜσℜM2\nLσ(P) = N2\nP\nℜM1 +ℜσ\nŁσ(S ) = N2\nS\nℜM2 +ℜσ\n⎫⎪⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎬⎪⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎭\n······ (7)\nThe inductance L\n1 can be measured at the primary side when\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 4.

Additionally, the equation for the complete leak-\nage inductance is given—one referred to the primary side\nL\nσ(P) and one to the secondary side Lσ(S ). With the above\nequations the analytic model for the series-parallel resonant\nconverter including the transformer could be set up in the fol-\nlowing section.\n3. Analysis of the Extended Model\nAs already mentioned the following considerations for the\nseries-parallel resonant converter shown in Fig. 5 are partly\nbased on the fundamental frequency analysis proposed in\nRef. (6). The method of Ref. (6) has been extended by a\nreluctance model for the transformer with its leakage induc-\ntance, a ZCS condition for one leg and the control by fre-\nquency and duty cycle. As far as possible and reasonable the\nnotation used in Ref. (6) has been retained.\nThe calculations are based on the assumptions that both\nthe primary resonant current I\nP and the secondary resonant\ncurrent IS are sinusoidal, that the output current is constant\nand that the components are ideal. The major procedure\nof the analysis is to determine the fundamental frequency\nimpedance Z\nCp Rof the parallel connection of CP and the rec-\ntiﬁer at ﬁrst. With this impedance the input impedance Z\nof the resonant circuit, seen by the converter /voltage source\nVAB, could be calculated. In the impedance Z also the re-\nluctance model of the transformer is included. In the next\nstep two equations can be set up. The ﬁrst one describes the\nFig. 5. Series-parallel resonant converter with reluc-\ntance model of the transformer. The converter output\nvoltage VAB is represented by its fundamental component\nVAB(1)\n(a)\n (b)\nFig. 6.

The second expres-\nsion relates the output voltage VOUT of the converter to the\nload voltage which is given by the load characteristic (VOﬀ &\nR) and the output current IOUT . These two equations together\nwith one (CCV) or two (DCV) additional equations describe\nthe behaviour of the system. The duty cycle D and the out-\nput current/voltage now can be calculated numerically for a\ngiven frequency f and load characteristic (VOﬀ & R)o rv i c e\nversa.\n3.1 Fundamental frequency impedance ZCPR In\nthe following the impedance ZCp Ris calculated for the DCV\n(Fig. 6(b)) by ﬁrst considering the fundamental component of\nthe rectiﬁer input current I\nR(1) (cf.

As long as the resonant current IS is smaller\nthan IOUT the capacitor voltage VCP is clamped to zero by\nthe negative diﬀerence between IS and IOUT [−(IS −IOUT )]\nwhich ﬂows through the rectiﬁer diodes. From the angle\nβon I\nS is larger than IOUT and in the same manner as in\nCCV the positive diﬀerence between the currents (IS −IOUT )\ncharges the capacitor CP.

Consequently, the two\nnonlinear equations for the angles αand β{(24) and (25) }\nmust be solved numerically together with (18) and (20).\nInstead of applying the described reluctance model for the\nmagnetic device for calculating the ﬂux distribution in the\ncore it is also possible to use the standard network model\nequations of a transformer\nV\nP =jωL1IP +jωMIs\nVS =jωMIP +jωL2Is\n}\n······················· (26)\nand calculate the ﬂux through the primary and the secondary\nwinding by\nφP = 1\njωNP\n·VP and φs = 1\njωNS\n·VS .······ (27)\nFor simple transformer designs the leakage ﬂux could be\napproximated by the di ﬀerence of the primary and the sec-\nondary ﬂux. This is, however, limited to standard transformer\ndesigns. More sophisticated transformers (e.g. integrated\nmagnetic devices or transformers with two magnetic shunts\nand/or leakage ﬂux in the window) can not be described by\nthe network equations as accurately as with the description of\nthe device by magnetic reluctances. Furthermore, the mag-\nnetic reluctances directly depend on the geometry of the de-\nvice what could be used in an optimisation process of the\n࿦ Dɼ126ר5ɼ2006 ೥ 573\nconverter. The values for L1, L2 and M in (26) must either be\nmeasured or calculated by a FEA and/or a reluctance model.\nThus, the approach with reluctance models is directly based\non the physics and the geometry of the device and therefore\nis used for the proposed calculation method.\n4. Validation of the Analytic Model\nFor validating the equations the results of the calculations\nare compared with simulation and measurement results in the\nfollowing. First, the simulation results of a series-parallel\nresonant converter, which is operating in the CCV and the\nDCV , are compared with the analytic calculations. There-\nafter, measurement and analytic results for a magnetically\nintegrated transformer, which realises the series inductance\nof the resonant tank by its leakage inductance, are shown.\nFinally, measurement results for an electromagnetically in-\ntegrated transformer are compared with the analytic calcula-\ntions.\nIn Fig. 8 the results for the operating frequency and the\nduty cycle of the analytic calculations and of the simulation\nof the series-parallel resonant converter are shown. The sim-\nulation is realised with SIMPLORER\nTMand includes a phys-\nical transformer model, where the ﬂux values in the diﬀerent\nlegs of the transformer also can be simulated. The value of\nthe resonant tank elements and the load are:\n•Series inductance Ls =12.5 µH\n•Series capacitance Cs =35 nF\n•Parallel capacitance Cp =110 nF\n•Load: R =0.04 Ω/VOﬀ =20 V\nFor these values the converter is in the CCV mode for light\nload (app. up to 45 A output current) and in the DCV mode\nfor heavy load. The crossover between the two analytic mod-\nels describing the diﬀerent modes is very smooth.\nIn Fig. 9 the values for the ﬂux through the primary and the\nsecondary winding and the leakage ﬂux are shown. As one\ncan see the analytical results are in very good correspondence\nwith the results of the simulation.\nIn the next step the analytic and the simulation results are\ncompared with measurement results, which are obtained with\nthe converter shown in Fig. 10. There, the resonant tank is\nbuilt up with discrete elements except for the series induc-\ntance which is integrated in the transformer. The secondary\nwinding of the transformer has a midpoint connection and its\nturn ratio is 14:2:2. The values of the resonant tank elements\nand the load are:\n•Series inductance L\ns =37 µH\n•Series capacitance Cs =88 nF\n•Parallel capacitance Cp =348 nF\n•Load: R =0.27 Ω/VOﬀ =0V .\nIn Fig. 11 the results for the operating frequency and for the\nduty cycle and in Fig. 12, 13 the results for the ﬂux through\nthe primary and the secondary winding and the leakage ﬂux\nare given. There, the converter is just operating in the DCV\ndue to the small value of the load resistance.\nThe ﬂux values can be measured by integrating the volt-\nages across the windings. With this method the leakage ﬂux\nis calculated as di ﬀerence between the primary and the sec-\nondary ﬂux. A more accurate method is to use a measure-\nment winding (one turn) around the two legs of the core\nand the magnetic shunt and integrate the induced voltages.\nFig. 8.

Electromagnetically integrated transformer\nTherewith, the leakage ﬂux could be measured directly.\nAgain, the results for the analytic calculation, for the sim-\nulation and also for the measurement correspond very well.\nFinally, the results for an electromagnetic integrated trans-\nformer shown in Fig. 14 are presented. There, the series ca-\npacitance is realised by the primary winding and the parallel\ncapacitance by the secondary winding. Moreover, the series\ninductance is implemented by increasing the leakage induc-\ntance of the transformer. The basic principles of integrating\ncapacities and inductivities are explained in Refs. (7)–(10)\nand the design of the enclosing winding structure is presented\nin Ref (10). The values of the integrated resonant tank ele-\nments are:\n•Series inductance L\ns =21 µH\n•Series capacitance Cs =37 nF\n•Parallel capacitance Cp =115 nF.\nWith the electromagnetically integrated transformer the ﬂux\nFig. 15.

Broken lines:p r e -\ndictions of proposed analytic model\nvalues in the diﬀerent legs of the core must be measured with\nadditional windings around the legs of the core (as described\nabove). This is especially true for the primary winding since\nthe measured voltage at the connections of the winding is the\nsum of the voltage across the series capacitance and the in-\nduced voltage which is not directly linked with the primary\nﬂux.\nThe reluctance model of the integrated transformer and the\ncircuit diagram of the rectiﬁer with load are given in Fig. 15.\nThe corresponding equations are given in (28).\nN\nPIP =ℜM1ΦP −ℜσΦS\n2NS IS =−(ℜσΦS +ℜM2 ·(ΦP +ΦS ))\n}\n······· (28)\nIn Fig. 16 the measured and calculated operating frequency\nand duty cycle against the output current are plotted and in\nFig. 17 the values for the primary, the secondary and the leak-\nage ﬂux are shown. Again, the converter is just operating in\nthe DCV-mode due to the relation between the resonant tank\nelements and the load.\nRemark: One leg of the converter is always switched at the\nzero crossing of the resonant current I\nP (ZCS). In order to\navoid for the complete load range that the anti-parallel diode\nof the MOSFET is turned of hardly the ZCS leg must be\nswitched always a little bit before the zero crossing. This\nsafety margin varies with the load current and also inﬂuences\nthe actual switching frequency of the converter. This eﬀect is\nnot included in the proposed analytic model and causes the\nrelatively large deviation (approximately 7.5%) of the calcu-\nlated result from the measured result for large output currents\n࿦ Dɼ126ר5ɼ2006 ೥ 575\nFig. 17. Fluxes ( |ΦS |, |ΦP|and |ΦP +ΦS |) in the diﬀerent\npaths of the integrated core against output current. Solid\nlines: measurement results. Broken lines: proposed ana-\nlytic model\nFig. 18.

CS =\n20 ··· 250 nF/CP =70 ··· 600 nF/LS =1 ··· 10 µH/N1 =\n14/N2 =2\nin Fig. 16.\nThe values predicted by the proposed calculation method\nare again in good correspondence with the measurement re-\nsults.\nAs shown above the proposed analytic model for the series-\nparallel resonant converter predicts accurately the operating\nfrequency, the duty cycle, all the voltages and currents (am-\nplitude and phase) and also the ﬂux values in the core if the\nresonant tank elements, the input voltage, the load current\nand the load are given (cf. Fig. 2). Furthermore, the model\njust consists just of a set of three equations for the CCV/four\nequations for the DCV which are solved numerically in order\nto calculate the operating point. The computation time is in\nthe range of a few seconds (<30 s on a Pentium IV , 2.8 GHz\nfor DCV). Thus, the analytic model could be used in the pro-\nposed optimisation procedure (Fig. 2).\nThe grey shaded area in Fig. 18—where the volume of the\nresonant circuit (i.e. the volume of the capacitors plus the\nvolume of the integrated transformer) against the operation\nfrequency at full load is given—shows the region for the vol-\nume and the frequency which could be reached if the val-\nues of the components is varied within the following bounds:\nC\nS = 20 ···250 nF/CP = 70 ··· 600 nF/LS = 1 ···10 µH.\nTable 1. Optimal converter design for parameter range\nof Fig. 17\nThis area is determined by varying the value of the series ca-\npacitance, the series inductance and the parallel capacitance\nwithin the given bounds and calculating the optimal vol-\nume of the converter for each ﬁxed triple ⟨C\nS , CP, LS ⟩with\nthe described optimisation procedure (cg. Fig. 2—except the\n“Global Optimisation Algorithm” which is replaced by a for-\nnext-loop). Each cross in Fig. 18 marks a volume obtained\nfor one triple ⟨C\nS , CP, LS ⟩whereby the number of primary\nand secondary turns is kept constant ( N1 =14 and N2 =2).\nAs one can see there is a distinct minimum of the volume\nclose to 400 kHz. Increasing or decreasing the operation fre-\nquency leads to an increasing volume. The values of the dif-\nferent parameters for the minimum volume calculated with\nthe optimisation procedure are given in Table 1.\nThe presented result for the optimisation is based on the\nfollowing data:\n•Core material: N87 from Epcos\n•Winding: Foil winding/solid wire\n•Transformer: Fixed power loss per surface area\n(Core: 1200 W/m\n2∥Winding: 2200 W/m2)\n•Centre Tapped secondary winding (Fig. 14)\n•MOSFETs: APT50M75B2LFLL from APT\n•Capacitors: Reference B32671 series from Epcos\n•Cooling capacity of heatsink: 200 W/dm3\nThe “Global Optimisation Algorithm” of the optimisation\nprocedure has been replaced by a for-next-loop in order to\nsee the sensitivity of the minimum i.e. the penalty one has to\npay if the designed values for the components of the resonant\ntank are not equal to the optimal ones.\nFurther results of the optimisation procedure for di ﬀerent\ndesign speciﬁcations, materials and constraints will be pre-\nsented in a future paper.\n5. Conclusion\nIn this paper an analytic model for the series-resonant con-\nverter including the magnetic device is presented. This model\nincludes also a ZCS condition for one leg of the converter\nand the control of the converter by frequency and duty cycle.\nThe calculated results of the analytic model and for the ﬂux\ndistribution within the magnetic core correspond very well\nwith the simulation and the measurement results presented\n576 IEEJ Trans. IA, Vol.126, No.5, 2006\nAnalytic Model for Resonant Converter Design and Optimization\nfor diﬀerent resonant circuits.\nWith the presented analytic model it is possible to calcu-\nlate the operating frequency, the duty cycle, all the currents\nand voltages and the ﬂux distribution in the transformer for\ngiven input voltage, load resistance, load o ﬀset voltage and\noutput current. The required calculation time for the model\nis low, so that the model could be used in the presented auto-\nmatic optimisation procedure which optimises, for example,\nthe overall converter volume or the eﬃciency of the converter\nsystem.\nWithin the optimisation procedure the losses in the trans-\nformer, the capacitors and the semiconductor are calculated\nand the (integrated) magnetic device is optimised in an in-\nner optimisation loop and the overall converter volume in a\nsecond optimisation algorithm. A telecom power supply is\ndesigned with the proposed analytic model and optimisation\nprocedure and the resulting design of the supply is presented\n(Output Power: 3.9 kW, Overall converter V olume: 1.36 dm\n3,\nEﬃciency: 93% and Power Density: 2.85 kW/dm3).\n(Manuscript received May 9, 2005,\nrevised Nov. 11, 2005)\nReferences\n( 1 ) G.A.
