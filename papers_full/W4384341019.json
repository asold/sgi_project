    "abstract": "Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) plays as an essential role in the assessment of cardiac function, providing quantitative data support for the medical diagnosis of heart disease. Robust evaluation of the ejection fraction relies on accurate left ventricular (LV) segmentation of echocardiograms. Because human bias and expensive labor cost exist in manual echocardiographic analysis, computer algorithms of deep-learning have been developed to help human experts in segmentation tasks. Most of the previous work is based on the convolutional neural networks (CNN) structure and has achieved good results. However, the region occupied by the left ventricle is large for echocardiography. Therefore, the limited receptive field of CNN leaves much room for improvement in the effectiveness of LV segmentation. In recent years, Vision Transformer models have demonstrated their effectiveness and universality in traditional semantic segmentation tasks. Inspired by this, we propose two models that use two different pure Transformers as the basic framework for LV segmentation in echocardiography: one combines Swin Transformer and K-Net, and the other uses Segformer. We evaluate these two models on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset of LV segmentation and compare the quantitative metrics with other models for LV segmentation. The experimental results show that the mean Dice similarity of the two models scores are 92.92% and 92.79%, respectively, which outperform most of the previous mainstream CNN models. In addition, we found that for some samples that were not easily segmented, whereas both our models successfully recognized the valve region and separated left ventricle and left atrium, the CNN model segmented them together as a single part. Therefore, it becomes possible for us to obtain accurate segmentation results through simple post-processing, by filtering out the parts with the largest circumference or pixel square. These promising results prove the effectiveness of the two models and reveal the potential of Transformer structure in echocardiographic segmentation.",
