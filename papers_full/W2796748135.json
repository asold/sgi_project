    "abstract": "Estimates of the technical condition of equipment of power plants and substations are presented in the paper. They are associated with a high degree of deterioration of the power grid equipment, which affects the state and operating conditions of the equipment. The degree of these mutual influences and their laws can only be established with a general assessment of the state of entire equipment of the power grid facility. The selection of a rational system for the repair of power oil transformers of distribution substations involves a problem with multiple variables, based on the concept of reliability, aging, renewal and industrial diagnostics. It is recommended to conduct a comprehensive method of repair organization based on the individual observation by the Consumer for changes in the technical condition of the equipment during operation and the quantitative evaluation of the technical condition of the transformers with respect to the set of diagnostic parameters.",
