Its health condition has a significant impact on the reliable \ndelivery of electricity. However, with substantial growth in \ndemand, transformers have been more frequently loaded than \nbefore. Meanwhile a large number of transformers are reaching \ntheir designed life or in certain cases operating beyond their \ndesigned life. Due to high cost associated with a transformer, it is \nnot always economical to replace it with a new unit by only \nconsidering the age of the transformer. As a result, continuously \nmonitoring and effective condition assessment is essential for safe \nand reliable operation of transformers. Some key issues and \nmethodologies of transformer condition assessment can be found \nin [1, 2]. \nOver the past decades a number of electrical and chemical \ntechniques have been developed for condition assessment of \ntransformers. Among them polarization and depolarization current \n(PDC) measurements and dissolved gas analysis (DGA) have \nattracted much attention across the research communities and \nutilities. A detailed review of PDC techniques for transformer \ncondition assessment can be found in one of the authors’ previous \npublication [3]. Several industry standards are available for DGA \nbased transformer fault diagnosis, for example the IEEE standard \n[4]. However, there are still considerable challenges and issues \nremaining in accurately interpreting measured data and explicitly \nmaking inference of a transformer’s condition based on the \nmeasurements of above electrical and chemical techniques.  \nThe interpretation schemes for PDC reported in the literature \nare mostly heuristic based and they make condition assessment \nmainly based on the measurement data acquired from the \ntransformer, which is under investigation [5, 6]. However, it would \nbe a significant feature that some historical measurement data \ncollected from other transformers can be utilised as references in \nthe process of condition assessment for the transformer under \ninvestigation. Especially, a computer program (algorithm) can be \ntrained to acquire the knowledge of underlying statistical \ndependency between historical data and the conditions of \ncorresponding transformers; such knowledge is then used to assist \nin evaluating the condition of a present transformer [7]. Moreover, \ndue to imprecision in measurement systems, influence of \nenvironmental interference and the limitation of human \nknowledge, there would be a certain degree of inaccuracy and \nuncertainty in data interpretation. Therefore, it would be \nappropriate to estimate the probability distribution in transformer \ncondition assessment to capture above uncertainties [8].  \nIn DGA interpretation, conventional ratio based schemes \nrelate key gas ratios to several predefined conditions of \ntransformers [4, 9]. In recent years, a number of artificial \nintelligence (AI) techniques have been applied to interpret \nDGA data including neural network, expert system, fuzzy \nlogic, and self-organizing map [10-12]. In practice, many \nfactors such as operating condition and utility practice have \nconsiderable impacts on the AI based algorithms.  Therefore, \nto apply AI algorithms to transformer condition assessment, \nextensive verifications are required. \nManuscript received on 20 August 2011, in final form 27 October 2011. \n \nThis paper investigates statistical learning techniques to \ndevelop an intelligent interpretation scheme for condition \nassessment of the power transformer. The statistical learning is \na data centric approach, which learns unknown dependency \nbetween a system’s inputs and outputs from the collected data \nsamples. Such dependency is then utilised to make prediction \nof future system outputs upon receiving new input data. \nAssuming for a number of transformers, their electrical or \nchemical measurement data are available and the \ncorresponding conditions of these transformers are known, the \nstatistical learning approach builds a model to approximate the \nunderlying dependency between the measured data and the \ntransformer condition. The model can later be used to make \ncondition assessment for other transformers. Within the \nstatistical learning framework, a support vector machine \n(SVM) algorithm has been developed in this paper to provide \nan intelligent tool for automatically analyzing measurement \ndata and making condition assessment of transformers. \nThe organization of this paper is as follows. Section 2 \nbriefly reviews PDC and DGA techniques. Section 3 discusses \nthe key ideas of the statistical learning technique, and \ndescribes the mathematic formulation and implementation of \nSVM algorithm. Section 4 presents the case studies in which \nthe developed algorithm is applied to make transformer \ncondition assessment based on DGA and PDC measurements. \nSection 5 concludes finding from this research work. \n \n2  REVIEW OF PDC AND DGA TECHNIQUES \n2.1 PDC TECHNIQUES [5] \nIn PDC measurement, a step dc voltage 0U  is applied \nacross the transformer insulation while recording the \ncorresponding current at the transformer terminals. The \nresultant current due to conduction and slow polarization \nprocesses is  \n \n( ) ( ) 000\n0\n0 ttUCtftIpol <<\n\n\n\n\n\n += ε\nσ        (1) \nwhere \nr\nmCC ε=0  is the geometrical capacitance of transformer \ninsulation ( mC is the measured capacitance and rε  is the \nrelative permittivity of transformer insulation at power \nfrequency), σ is the average conductivity of the transformer \ninsulation,  0ε is the permittivity of free space, and ( )t fis the \ndielectric response function which is a monotonically \ndecreasing function in time. \nAt time 0tt=  the above dc voltage 0U  is removed and \ntransformer insulation is externally short circuited through an \nelectrometer which records the current. Due to the re-\norientation of dipoles there will be a depolarization current \nflowing through the transformer insulation which opposes the \npolarization direction: \n \n( ) ( ) ( ){ } ∞<<+−−= tUCttftftIdepol 0000     (2)         \n \nIf the transformer insulation is charged for a sufficiently long \ntime, the effect of \n( )0ttf +  on equation 2 can be neglected \n[5]. As a result equation 2 becomes  \n \n( ) ( ) 00UCtftIdepol ×−≈                             (3) \n \nEquation 3 implies that the depolarization current can be \napproximated by deducting the conductivity current (first part \nin equation 1) from the polarization current given the charging \ntime is sufficiently long.  \nDielectric polarization of transformer insulation is a \ncombination of various polarization mechanisms having \ndifferent response times for the applied electric field. \nTherefore the electrical response of transformer insulation \nsystem can be represented by an electric circuit consisting of \nresistors and capacitors as shown in Figure 1. In Figure 1 the \nresponse of dipoles are represented by a series combination of \nresistance R \ni and capacitance C i , which have an associated \ntime constant of τ i = R i × C  i ; 01 R  is the dc conduction and \nC m  is the measured capacitance at power frequency. \n \nnR3R2R\n0R0U\nnC3C2C1C\nmC\n1R\n \nFigure 1. Circuitry representation of transformer insulation system. \n \nAn algorithm has been developed by one of the authors of \nthis paper which extracts the above parameters, i.e. the \nresistances and capacitances from the measured polarization \nand depolarization currents [13]. In this paper, the extracted \nparameters will be adopted as discriminative features in \nstatistical learning algorithm for assessing transformer \ncondition based on PDC measurements. \n2.2 DGA TECHNIQUES [4, 9] \nOperating under excessive thermal and electrical stresses, \nthe insulation system of a transformer will form by-product \ngases such as hydrogen (H 2), methane (CH 4), acetylene \n(C 2H 2), ethylene (C 2H 4), ethane (C 2H 6), carbon monoxide \n(CO) and carbon dioxide (CO 2). DGA technique makes use of \nthe concentrations or relative proportions of these gases for \ntransformer fault diagnosis. The commonly adopted DGA \ninterpretation schemes include key gas method, ratio based \nmethod and artificial intelligence (AI) method. \nIn the key gas method, several gas contents are adopted to \ndetect four types of faults including oil overheating, paper \noverheating, partial discharge, and arcing. In the ratio based \n \nmethods such as Dörnenburg Ratios, Rogers Ratios, Duval \nTriangle and IEC Ratios, the diagnosis is made by computing \nseveral key gas ratios and mapping these ratios to the \npredefined fault patterns.  \nAlthough widely adopted in utilities, key gas and ratio based \nmethods still have some limitations. For example, the ratio \nbased schemes may lead to discrepancies in interpretation. \nSometimes it may not be able to provide an interpretation for \nevery possible combination of ratio values and give an explicit \ndiagnosis. To address these limitations, artificial intelligence \n(AI) techniques have been developed to recognize different \nfault conditions of transformers [10-12]. Different AI \ntechniques have their own merits as well as limitations. There \nare still avenues for further research, especially the \napplicability and adaptability of these techniques when they \nare applied at different utilities.  \n \n3  STATISTICAL LEARNING TECHNIQUE \nAND ITS ALGORITHM \n3.1 CONCEPT OF STATISTICAL LEARNING  \n Statistical learning algorithm estimates an unknown (input, \noutput) dependency of a system using a set of previously \ncollected and already known samples and upon such \nestimation it builds up an approximated model which can be \nsubsequently used for predicting future system output upon \nreceiving new input [14-16]. Instead of estimating “true” \nmodel (i.e. density estimation), the statistical learning aims to \nachieve good generalization from the available data. Figure 2 \npresents the concept and procedure of statistical learning. \n \nTraining dataset \n(x, y) Statistical Learning \nAlgorithm \nSystem \nMeasurement  x\nUnobservable \nvariables z \nOutput  y \n(a) \nModel \nPredicting output y \nfor new measurement x \n(b) \n.\n.\n.\n \n Figure 2.  Illustrative diagrams of statistical learning. (a) Concept of \nstatistical learning; (b) Procedure of statistical learning. \nIn Figure 2, training data point (x, y) denotes the already \nknown sample with the measurement (observation) x and \noutput y. The variables z denote the factors which have \nimpacts on system outputs but their values are not directly \nobservable. In PDC measurement, the variation of polarization \nand depolarization currents with time are measurements x \nwhile the condition of the transformer insulation is the system \noutput y. Moreover, the moisture contents and ageing highly \ninfluence PDC measurement of transformer insulation; \nhowever they are hardly to be measured directly and thus can \nbe regarded as variables z. By using the historical \nmeasurement data samples, the statistical learning is tasked to \nexploit the dependency between the polarization and \ndepolarization currents and the insulation condition of the \ntransformer without the explicit knowledge of moisture \ncontents and ageing extents in the transformer (Figure 2a). \nUpon such exploitations an approximated model can be built \nup to associate the measured data with the condition of \ntransformer insulation. Consequently, the model is used to \ninterpret any new PDC data and make assessment of insulation \ncondition for the corresponding transformer (Figure 2b).  \nThe key benefit of statistical learning lies in its capability of \nutilizing the information contained in historical data to \ninvestigate properties about future data. Based on statistical \nlearning methodology, this paper develops a SVM algorithm \nfor transformer condition assessment using DGA and PDC \nmeasurements.  \n3.2 SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE ALGORITHM \nSupport vector machine (SVM) algorithm involves a trade-\noff between the accuracy attained on the training data and the \n“capacity” of prediction on new data without error [17, 18]. \nThis section briefly describes the formulation and \nimplementation of a SVM algorithm.  \nAssuming there are N  samples \n[ ]NxxX ..., ,1=  and each \nsample belongs to one of the T independent \nclasses { }Tyy ..., ,1 , the SVM algorithm is tasked to correctly \nassign each sample to its corresponding class. SVM algorithm \nstarts with transforming the data samples X  from the original \nspace mℜ  to a higher dimensional space Ω through ( )Xh φ= . \nThen SVM searches for an optimal separation hyperplane in \nthat feature space by solving the following quadratic \nprogramming (QP) problem: \n \nMinimize         \n∑ =+\nN\nk k\nT C 12\n1 ξww                           (4)                               \nSubject to    ( ) Nkby kkk ..., , 11 =−≥+⋅ ξhw   (5) \n            and    Nkk ..., , 10 =≥ξ                                (6) \n \nwhere C  is the regularization parameter which balances the \nmargin maximization and classification violation. By \nintroducing Lagrange multiples \nkα , the above QP problem \ncan be transformed into its dual form [17]: \n \nMaximize  \njkjkj\nN\nk\nN\nj k\nN\nk k yy hhααα ∑ ∑∑ = == − 1 11 2\n1   (7)             \nSubject to   NkCk\nN\nk kk ..., , 1001 =≤≤=∑ = αα h  (8) \n \nAfter obtaining the optimal hyperplane, SVM algorithm can \npredict the class label for a new sample \nx as  \n \n[ ]∑ = +⋅= sN kkk byy 1ksgn hhα             (9)      \n \nwhere \nsN  is the number of support vectors.  \nTo provide the estimates of uncertainty in transformer \ncondition assessment, the probability that one particular data \nkx belongs to one of the T  classes is also computed. The \ndetailed implementation of the above SVM algorithm can be \nfound in one of the authors’ previous publications [8]. \n4  CASE STUDIES  \nThis section presents case studies to demonstrate the \napplicability of statistical learning techniques and SVM \nalgorithm for transformer condition assessment based on DGA \nand PDC measurements. In the algorithmic implementation \nsome software routines from the available toolbox have been \nadopted with necessary modifications and extensions [19].  \n4.1  TRANSFORMER CONDITION ASSESSEMENT \nBASED ON DGA MEASUREMENT \nThe aim of this case study is to recognize normal operating \ncondition and fault conditions occurring in transformers which \ninclude discharge fault, lower to medium range thermal fault, \nhigh range thermal fault and partial discharge. A database \nconsisting of 390 DGA records provided by a utility company \nis used for verifying the SVM algorithm developed in this \npaper. In this database, each DGA record contains key gas \nconcentrations in volume as well as the class label of the \ncorresponding transformer, which is based on the utility’s \ndiagnosis results obtained from on-site inspections and utility \nexpert knowledge. The gas concentrations, \ni.e., \n4624222 CH ,HC,HC,HC , and 2H in volume are used as \ndiscriminated features (input) in the algorithm, i.e. the input \ndata is a data array with dimensions of 390×5. Before running \nthe SVM algorithm, the input data are normalized to [0, 1] \ninterval.  \nThe above dataset of 390 DGA records are randomly split \ninto two datasets: a training (validation) dataset consisting of \n275 records and a testing dataset consisting of 115 records. \nThe radial-based function (RBF) kernel \n( ) ( )\n2\n,\nji\neK ji\nxx\nxx\n−−\n=\nγ\nis adopted for training the SVM \nalgorithm. A grid search is conducted to decide the optimal \nvalues for pairs (C , γ) on the training (validation) dataset, \nwhere C  is the regularization parameter for balancing the \nmargin maximization and classification violation (equations 7 \nand 8) and γ is the variance parameter of RBF kernel function. \nOnce the optimal C and γ are found, the SVM model is trained \nusing the above training dataset. Tenfold cross validation is \nalso performed on the training dataset. And finally the trained \nSVM model is applied to assess the condition of transformers \nin the testing dataset. Each transformer in the testing dataset \nwill be assigned a class label with probability to indicate its \ncondition, i.e. in normal operating condition or in fault \nconditions.   \nThe above procedure of dataset splitting, training \n(validation) and testing is repeated ten times. The averaged \nclassification accuracy of tenfold cross validation on training \ndataset over ten trials is 88.62% (standard deviation ±1.89%). \nAnd the averaged classification accuracy on testing dataset \naveraged over ten trials is 88.61% (standard deviation \n±2.03%). Table 1 shows some typical classification results of \nthe SVM algorithm on the testing dataset.  \n \nTable 1.

Thus it would be useful to estimate the \nprobabilities for each type of fault. In Table 1 the SVM \nalgorithm indicates the probability of each fault as a \npercentage. Such interpretation will be beneficial for \nunderstanding of the overall “health status” of a power \ntransformer’s insulation system. For example, Transformer \nTX5 in Table 1 is diagnosed as high temperature thermal fault \nwith 52% probability; meanwhile the SVM algorithm indicates \nthat this transformer also has a 48% chance of having a \ndischarge fault.  \n \n4.2 TRANSFORMER CONDITION ASSESSMENT \nBASED ON PDC MEASUREMENT \n4.2.1 SCALING SCHEME FOR QUANTIFYING TRANSFORMER \nINSULATION USING PDC MEASUREMENT \nIn PDC measurement, one of the major tasks is to \ninvestigate the possible reason for changing the magnitude of \npolarization and depolarization currents – the likelihood of \ncondition change of paper insulation and/or oil insulation. This \nwould help to understand the correlation between PDC \nmeasurement and transformer insulation condition.  \nTo quantify the condition of transformer insulation using \nPDC measurement it is necessary to model the PDC response \nof the transformer insulation. As explained in Section 2 the RC \ncircuitry representation (Figure 1) is one of the commonly \nadopted techniques. In that representation the resistance and \ncapacitance of the two largest RC branches and the \nconductivity of paper are used to represent the influence of \npaper insulation and the resistance and capacitance of the two \nsmallest RC branches and the conductivity of oil are used to \nrepresent the influence of oil insulation [13]. In order to \n \nquantify the oil and paper insulation condition of a transformer \nusing the above parameters, a scaling scheme is proposed in \nthis paper, which is based on the assumption that the \ncontribution of different polarization processes toward the \nmagnitude of polarization and depolarization current will be \nchanged with the change of insulation condition. The scaling \nscheme models different condition of oil and paper insulation \nas follows:   \n   1. Simulating the condition of oil insulation: As the smallest \nRC branches represent the oil quality [5], the dielectric \nresponse of degraded oil can be represented by introducing a \nscalar coefficient α (α=1, 2, …,) to the resistance and \ncapacitance of the two RC branches having lowest time \nconstants as shown in equation 10. In addition, oil conductivity \ncan also be multiplied by the same coefficient to represent the \nincrease of conductivity. The coefficient adopts the values of α \nto describe the extent of degradation of oil insulation. The \nlarger the value of α, the worse the condition of oil insulation. \nl\n'\n2\n'\n21\n'\n1\n2\n'\n21\n'\n1\n11\noi oil σσ\nCCCC\nRRRR\n×=\n×=×=\n×=×=\n−−−−\n−−−−\nα\nαα\nαα\n             (10)  \n    \n   2. Simulating the condition of paper insulation: As the \nlargest RC branches represent the paper condition [5], the \ndielectric response of degraded paper can be represented by \nintroducing a scalar coefficient β (β=1, 2, …, etc) to the \nresistance and capacitance of the two RC branches having \nhighest time constants as shown in equation 11. In addition, \npaper conductivity can also be multiplied by the same \ncoefficient to represent the increase of conductivity. The \ncoefficient adopts the values of  β to describe the extent of \ndegradation of paper insulation. The larger the value of β, the \nworse the condition of paper insulation. \npaper paper σσ\nCCCC\nRRRR\n×=\n×=×=\n×=×=\nβ\nββ\nββ\n'\n2\n'\n21\n'\n1\n2\n'\n21\n'\n1\n11\n                (11)                              \n                                      \n   In the above equations, subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the two \nlargest RC branches and subscripts -1 and -2 refer to the two \nsmallest RC branches of the equivalent circuit, σ\npaper  and σoil  are \nthe conductivities of paper and oil, respectively. \nIn the PDC case studies throughout this section, a so-called \nreference transformer  will be adopted, on which the above \nscaling scheme is applied. The process starts with the \ncomputation of the representative parameters such as \nresistances and capacitances of the two largest RC branches, \npaper conductivity, resistances and capacitances of the two \nsmallest RC branches and oil conductivity of the reference \ntransformer from its PDC measurement. These parameters are \nthen processed according to equations 10 and 11.   \nTo simulate different insulation conditions for other \ntransformers (named as testing transformer) with reference to \nthat of the reference transformer, in the above process the \nscaling coefficients α and β are assigned different values, \nwhich include (1) α=1, 2, 3,…, etc for the cases in which the \noil conductivity and the extent of polarization processes in oil \ninsulation is higher than that of the reference transformer; (2) \nβ=1, 2, 3 …, etc for the cases in which the paper conductivity \nand the extent of polarization processes in paper insulation is \nhigher than that of the reference transformer; (3) \n... 3\n1,2\n1, 1=α etc for the cases in which the oil conductivity \nand the extent of polarization processes in oil insulation is \nlower than that of the reference transformer; and (4) \n... 3\n1,2\n1, 1=β etc for the cases in which the paper \nconductivity and the extent of the polarization processes in \npaper insulation is lower than that of the reference transformer. \nTherefore above four scenarios quantifies the level of testing \ntransformer insulation condition with respect to the reference \ntransformer. Accordingly, a dataset can be generated \nconsisting of a number of data points to describe various \ninsulation conditions. This dataset will be used to train the \nSVM algorithm. The trained SVM model is then used to assess \nthe oil and paper insulation conditions of testing transformers, \nwhich are of interest.  \nTo assess the insulation condition of a testing transformer, \nthe representative parameters of this transformer including RC \nparameters and oil and paper conductivities are firstly \ncalculated from its PDC measurement. These parameters are \nthen fed into the above trained SVM model, which will be \nsubsequently adopted to assess the insulation condition of this \ntest transformer. By adopting the same reference transformer, \nthe insulation conditions of different testing transformers can \nbe evaluated and compared. This will be exemplified in the \nfollowing case studies.  \n4.2.2 CASE STUDIES ON FIELD TRANSFOEMRS \nTable 2 provides the information of a number of \ntransformers A to E. The PDC measurements were conducted \nfor these transformers in an open substation environment. The \ntests were carried out at the charging dc voltage of 500 V or \n1000 V  and with 10,000 s charging and discharging periods. \nPDC measurements were conducted for transformer B before \nand after oil reclamation, and the corresponding PDC \nmeasurements are denoted as Bm 1 and Bm 2, respectively.  \nAmong the above transformers, transformer A is selected as \nthe reference transformer  for assessing the condition of four \ntesting transformers B to E.  \n    The polarization and depolarization currents of transformers \nA to E are plotted in Figures 3 to 5. The measured PDC \ncurrents of each transformer were normalized by the \ncorresponding testing voltage and geometric capacitance \nvalues. Such normalization provides an equivalent base of \ngeometry and charging voltage for easier comparison between \ndifferent transformers. From Figures 3 to 5 it can be observed \nthat the magnitudes of polarization and depolarization currents \n \nof reference transformer A are lower than those of \ntransformers B to E. This reveals that the overall insulation \ncondition of transformer A is better than the insulation \ncondition of transformers B to E.  \n \nTable 2.

The SVM \nassessment results on insulation conditions of transformers B \nto E are summarized in Table 3.  \n \nTable 3.

It can be seen from \nFigure 3 that the magnitude of polarization and depolarization \ncurrent Bm \n2, which was measured after the oil reclamation on \ntransformer B are smaller than that of Bm 1, which was \nmeasured before the oil reclamation process. This indicates \nthat the overall insulation of transformer B is improved after \noil reclamation. Now the task is to quantify the extent of such \ninsulation condition change. As shown in Table 3, for \ntransformer B, the dielectric response of its oil insulation \nbefore the reclamation is around 50 times (with about 90% \nprobability) inferior to that of the reference transformer A. In \ncontrast, after the oil reclamation, the dielectric response of oil \ninsulation of transformer B is around five times (with about \n70% probability) inferior to that of transformer A. This implies \nthat the oil condition of this transformer is improved about ten \ntimes after oil reclamation. As such, the SVM algorithm \nprovides quantitative information regarding oil insulation \ncondition of transformers.  \nIt can also be seen from Table 3 that before oil reclamation, \nthe dielectric response of paper insulation of transformer B is \naround 25 times (with about 60% probability) inferior to that \nof transformer A. However, after oil reclamation, the dielectric \nresponse of paper insulation of transformer B is around 10 \ntimes (with about 70% probability) inferior to that of \ntransformer A. Therefore, it can be concluded that the paper \ninsulation of transformer B is also slightly improved after oil \n \nreclamation. Condition of paper insulation depends both on \nageing process and moisture level. Ageing rate is faster with \nhigher moisture level and vice versa. The oil-reclamation \nprocess consisted of filtering and drying the oil through \nvacuum at high temperature. The dry and filtered oil was \npumped back to the tank and the whole process was continued \nin a closed-cycle. In such a closed-cycle oil reclamation \nprocess, it is expected that some moisture and by-products \nwould be driven off the oil. At the same time when the dry oil \nis circulated through the transformer, some moisture will also \nmigrate out of the paper towards the relatively dry oil. Any \nmeasurement carried out after the oil reclamation shows some \nimprovement in paper insulation condition due to low moisture \nlevel.  \nTransformers C and D are both 100 MVA transformers \nlocated in the same substation. Transformer D has just \nundergone oil reclamation before conducting PDC \nexperiments. Table 3 shows that the dielectric response of the \noil insulation of C is around 35 times inferior to that of A; \nwhile the dielectric response of the oil insulation of D is \naround five times inferior to that that of A. This indicates that \nthe oil condition of D is better than that of C, and also \ncoincides with the fact that D was measured just after the oil \nreclamation. Table 3 also indicates that the condition of paper \ninsulation of D is slightly better than that of C.  \nFrom Figure 5 and Table 3, it can be revealed that the \noverall insulation condition of transformer E is more \ndeteriorated, the dielectric response of its oil insulation is \nabout 50 times inferior to that of transformer A. This is not \nunexpected since transformer E has been in operation since \n1936.  \nThe comparison on insulation conditions can also be made \nbetween transformer B and transformers C and D. It can be \nseen from Table 3 that the oil condition of C is slightly better \nthan that of B (before oil reclamation): the dielectric response \nof oil insulation of C is around 35 times inferior to that of \ntransformer A, while the dielectric response of oil insulation of \ntransformer B before oil reclamation is around 50 times \ninferior to that of transformer A. For transformers D and B \n(after oil reclamation), their oil insulation conditions are \nalmost the same. \nThe above case study demonstrated that the SVM algorithm \ncan provide quantitative information regarding the condition of \npaper and oil insulation of a transformer. Through modeling \nvarious conditions of oil and paper insulation based on the RC \nfeatures of a reference transformer the proposed scaling \nscheme facilitated the condition assessment for other \ntransformers, which are of interest. The next section will \nprovide a case study to reveal the correlation between DGA \nand PDC measurements by using the SVM algorithm. \n \n4.3 DGA AND PDC CORRELATION IN \nTRANSFORMER CONDITION ASSESSMENT \nDGA and PDC technique investigates transformer insulation \nsystem from different perspective. In this section the SVM \nalgorithm is applied to make condition assessment on a \nnumber of transformers based on both DGA and PDC \nmeasurements. It aims to reveal any possible correlation \nbetween DGA and PDC measurements on these transformers. \nTable 4 presents the information of these transformers.  \n  \nTable 4. Transformers Information. \n(Both DGA and PDC Measurements Conducted). \nTransformer Power \n(MVA) Voltage (kV) Manufacture year \nD1 375 330 2008 \nD2 133 330 1974 \nD3 530 390 1981 \nD4 45 23 1982 \nD5 45 23 1982 \n \nThe SVM model trained in section 4.1 is applied to \nrecognize normal operating and faults conditions for the above \nfive transformers D1 to D5 based on their DGA measurements. \nThe assessment results are shown in Table 5.   \n \nTable 5. SVM Assessment Results for Transformers D1 to D5 (DGA). \n[Normal DS MT HT PD] is the probability of each class, where Normal - normal \noperating condition, DS - discharge fault, MT- lower to medium range thermal \nfault, HT- high range thermal fault, and PD - partial discharge.  \nTransformer Probability \nof Each Class \nSVM \nResults \nD1     [0.94    0   0.06   0   0] Normal \nD2     [0.93    0   0.07   0   0] Normal \nD3          [0.88    0   0.12   0   0] Normal \nD4          [0.93    0   0.07   0   0] Normal \nD5     [0.94    0   0.06   0   0] Normal \n \nAs shown in Table 5, all five transformers D1 to D5 are \nclassified as in normal operation condition. However, \ncompared to other four transformers, D3 has about 12% \nchance of having lower to medium range thermal fault. This \nimplies that D3 might be slightly deteriorating toward thermal \nfault from its normal operating condition. The PDC \ninterpretation results will reveal that the oil insulation of D3 is \nmore degraded than that of other four transformers. \nFigure 6 plots the measured polarization currents \n(normalized by testing voltage and geometric capacitance \nvalues) of transformers D1 to D5. The charging dc voltage for \nthese five transformers is 200 V and the charging period is \n10,000 \n s. The significant current drop of transformer D1 at \ninitial stage might be due to the measurement error.  \nTime (s) \nCurrent/(U 0*C 0)  (      ) \nPol D2 Pol D3 \nPol D4 Pol D1 Po D5 \nnA —VF  \n \nFigure 6.  Polarization currents of transformers D1 to D5. \n \nIt can be observed from Figure 6 that the overall \npolarization current of D1 is lower than that of D2 to D5. This \nimplies that the overall insulation condition of D1 is better \nthan that of D2, D3, D4 and D5. Therefore, D1 is selected as \nreference transformer  in this case study for assessing the \ninsulation condition of testing transformers D2 to D5.  \nAs discussed in Section 2, the depolarization current can be \napproximated by deducting the conductivity current from the \npolarization current. In this case study the approximated \ndepolarization current is used to compute RC parameters for \ntransformers D1 to D5. It is now established that in PDC \nmeasurements the initial part of measured current is \nsignificantly influenced by the oil insulation while the final \npart of measured current is influenced by the paper insulation \n[5]. The SVM algorithm used the resistances and capacitances \nof the two RC branches with the smallest time constants as the \ndiscriminative features for oil insulation, and it used the \nresistances and capacitances of the two RC branches with the \nlargest time constants as the discriminative features for paper \ninsulation. These parameters were computed from the \nmeasured PDC currents. In the computation, the data located \naround the points with measurements error (Figure 6, the \nmeasured currents of Transformer D1) were not necessary.  \nTherefore, the measurement error would not affect the analysis \nof oil and paper insulation using SVM algorithms.  \nAdopting the same procedure as detailed in Section 4.2, the \nscaling scheme is applied to the reference transformer D1 to \nsimulate various oil and paper insulation conditions and \ngenerate a dataset to train the SVM algorithm. The trained \nSVM model is then utilized to make insulation condition \nassessment on transformers D2 to D5. Table 6 summarized the \nSVM assessment results for the insulation condition of D2 to \nD5.  \n \nTable 6. SVM Assessment Results for Transformers D2 to D5                      \n                        (With Reference to Transformer D1). \nInsulation                    Comments \n      (with reference to transformer D1) \nOil of Transformer D2 About 60% chance of around 5 times \ninferior dielectric response \nOil of Transformer D3 About 90% chance of around 15  times \ndegraded condition \nOil of Transformer D4 About 70% chance of around 5 times \ninferior dielectric response \nOil of Transformer D5 About 70% chance of around 5 times \ninferior dielectric response \nPaper of Transformer D2 About 65% chance of around 5 times \ninferior dielectric response \nPaper of Transformer D3 About 70% chance of around 15  times \ninferior dielectric response \nPaper of Transformer D4  About 70% chance of around 5 times \ninferior dielectric response \nPaper of Transformer D5 About 65% chance of around 5 times \ninferior dielectric response \n \nAs shown in Table 6, the oil condition of D3 is more \ndegraded than that of other three transformers D2, D4, and D5: \nthe dielectric response of oil insulation of transformer D3 is \naround 15 times inferior to that of D1; the dielectric response \nof oil insulation of transformers D2, D4 and D5 are around \nfive times inferior to that of D1. This result coincides with the \nDGA result as shown in Table 5, which indicates D3 might be \nslightly deteriorating toward thermal fault while other three \ntransformers are in normal operation condition. Moreover, as \nshown in Table 6 the SVM classification result also indicates \nthe paper insulation condition of D2, D4, and D5 are better \nthan that of D3.  \nThis case study demonstrated that the SVM algorithm can \nbe successfully used to interpret both DGA and PDC results \nand can possibly reveal some correlation between these two \ntechniques or can provide complementary information. \n5  CONCULSIONS  \nThis paper investigated the statistical learning techniques \nfor condition assessment of transformers. Within the statistical \nlearning framework this paper developed an SVM algorithm. \nThe case studies demonstrated the applicability of this \nalgorithm in condition assessment for field transformers. \nCompared to conventional ratio based DGA interpretation \nscheme, the algorithm developed in this paper is capable of \nindicating that several fault conditions may occur \nsimultaneously in a transformer or a transformer might be \ndeteriorating from its normal operating condition by providing \nprobability of each fault condition. The statistical learning \ntechnique proposed in this paper provides an effective tool for \nquantifying the insulation conditions of transformers based on \nPDC measurement. It makes use of historical PDC data \ncollected from other transformers as reference to train the \nalgorithm for acquiring the knowledge of underlying statistical \ndependency between historical data and the conditions of \ncorresponding transformer. Such knowledge is then used to \nassist in evaluating the condition of a transformer of interest.  \nREFERENCES \n1.  M. Wang, A.J. Vandermaar, and K.D.
