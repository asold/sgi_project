    "abstract": "Low-Power Instrument Transformers (LPITs) are becoming the preferred measurement device in the medium voltage (MV) distribution network (DN). They have several benefits compared to legacy solutions. However, the adoption of LPITs results in the need for adapting the grid and its assets to accept them. One practical example is using LPITs as the current and voltage source for energy meters (EMs), which are also used for billing purposes. The resulting measurement chain introduces several metrological challenges that must be studied and investigated. Therefore, in this work, the scenarios of LPITs and energy meters are introduced along with the latest relevant international standards. Afterwards, the opportunities and obstacles due to the implementation of the LPIT plus energy meter measurement chain are discussed. The discussion focuses on metrological requirements, accuracy evaluation, target uncertainty, and influence quantities affecting the performance of the devices.",
