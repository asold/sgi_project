INTRODUCTION\nThe reliability of the power transformer insulation system is\na major concern point for electric power utilities. The aging\nprocess of the insulation system may take place accompa-\nnied with degradation in the insulating characteristics. This\ndegradation may lead to a complete failure in the transformer\ninsulation system and consequently, a serious problem can\ntake place [1]. Due to its low cost and the ability to withstand\nhigh electrical and mechanical stresses, oil-paper insulation\nsystem is widely used as the main power transformers insu-\nlation system [2], [3]. In different sites all over the world,\nmany transformers have reached their designed lifetime. Due\nto the lack of replacement costs, these transformers are kept\nin service while implementing periodic monitoring and tests\nto the state of the internal insulation system. Thus, diagnos-\ntic methods such as dissolved gas analysis tests and Furan\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Nagarajan Raghavan.\ncompounds analysis are gaining more concern as an efﬁcient\nyet effective approach to assess the reliability of transformers\ninsulation systems [4].\nChemical construction of the insulating paper consists of a\nchain of anhydroglucose connected together with glycosidic\nbonds [5], [6]. As a result of multi anhydroglucose rings\npresence in this chemical compound, two weak points are\nformed. Firstly is C-O molecular bonds, and secondly is the\nglycosidic bonds [7]. These bounds have low thermal stabil-\nity in comparison with hydrocarbon bonds that exist in the\ntransformer oil [5]. Thus, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide,\nhydrocarbon byproducts, water and Furan compounds are\ngenerated during insulating papers decomposition that may\noccur as a result of the thermal aging process [8]–[10]. Fortu-\nnately, Furan compounds are generated only from cellulose.\nHowever, other degradation byproducts can be emitted during\noil aging phenomenon [10]. Furthermore, most of these Furan\ncompounds are stable in transformer oil for high temperatures\nup to 140 ◦C. [11]. Thus, the presence of Furan compounds\n102264 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

El-Aalet al.: Prediction of Transformers Conditions and Lifetime Using Furan Compounds Analysis\nremains in oil transformers even at high temperatures in order\nto provide an indication to a serious problem facing paper\ninsulation system.\n2-Furfural (2-FAL), 2-Furfurol (2-FOL), 5-Hydroxy\nmethyl 2-furfural (5-HMF), 5-Methy-2-furfural (5-MEF),\nand 2-Acetylfuran (2-ACF) are the ﬁve chemical products\nthat deﬁned as Furan Compounds [12]. 2-FAL can be con-\nsidered the main component of Furan compounds and many\nresearchers studied the relation between its presence and the\ndecrease in the Degree of polymerization (DP) of the insulat-\ning paper [13]–[15]. DP can be deﬁned as the average number\nof glycosidic rings in cellulose macromolecule chain [1].\nNew Kraft insulating paper has a DP value approximately\nequal to 1200 while a DP value less than 200 indicates that\nthe insulating paper must not be used any more [16].\nPrevious literature indicated that the age of the transformer\nis mainly correlated to the state of the solid insulating sys-\ntem [16]–[19]. DP is a widely accepted measurement that\nexamines the health state of the insulating paper inside the\ntransformers [16], [17], [20], [21]. However, it is not prac-\ntically recommended to take a sample of insulating paper\nfrom an operating transformer in order to measure DP. This\nmay lead to local damage in the winding system. More-\nover, viscometry method that used to measure DP, is not a\ndeﬁnite accurate method because it is affected by the sur-\nrounding temperature [22]. Consequently, different mathe-\nmatical models have been presented in order to estimate the\nDP factor depending on Furan tests instead of measuring it.\nChendong and Xue [23] and Pablo [24] have introduced two\nwidely applied models presented by equations 1 and 2 respec-\ntively. Many researches have depended on these two models\nas accurate and applicable models for DP estimation [5],\n[25]–[31].\nlog10(2 −FALppm) =1.51(.0035)×(DP) (1)\nDP =(800)/{(0.186×2−FALppm)+1}(2)\nwhere ppm: part per million\nIn this paper, a new proposed formula used to predict DP\nfactor in relation with 2-FAL is presented. This empirical\nform has been deduced by experimental tests. The validity\nof this formula is examined by estimating the DP of the\ninsulating paper and comparing the obtained results with\nother results obtained by De Pablo and Chendong models.\nFinally, the new form is used to predict the lifetime and the\ninsulation system state of a transformer that operates in Abo\nSultan steam power plant in Egypt. Furthermore, a general\ntechnique that can be used in order to estimate the remaining\nlifetime of any transformer will be introduced.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS OF (DP) AND (2-FAL) TEST\nIn the present work, the impregnation process has been prop-\nerly accomplished in order to provide accurate results and\nconsistent testing conditions. Following the DIN EN 60763-\n2 standard, 0.5 mm thickness Kraft papers have been dried\nat a pressure that does not exceed 1 mbar at a temperature\nof 105 ◦C for 24 hours. Then, the dried Kraft papers are\nTABLE 1. Measured values of DP and 2- FAL{part per billion (ppb)} .\nimpregnated with the insulating oil at a pressure lower than\n1 mbar. Finally, the oil-paper insulation is kept in a ten liter\ncapacity aluminum vessel. After ﬁnishing the impregnation\nprocess, the papers are able to withstand the aging tests [32].\nIn the current research Kraft insulating papers have been\nimpregnated with two different types of oil and kept in two\nseparated aluminum vessels. The ﬁrst oil is parafﬁnic-based\noil, while the other is naphthenic-based oil. These two vessels\nhave been kept in an electrical oven at a temperature of 130 ◦C\nin order to simulate the thermal aging process. Every 28 days,\na sample of the impregnated paper has been taken from each\nvessel as a cycle of the thermal aging process as reported\nin [33]. The 2-FAL compound and the DP factor have been\nmeasured for every sample in order to obtain the proposed\nempirical form.\nIn this experiment, DP has been measured according to\nASTM D4243 standard and 2-Fal has been measured accord-\ning to ASTM D5837 standard. Every test has been repeated\nsix times with ﬁve paper samples for each oil in order to get\naccurate results. DP has been measured for all paper samples\nbefore the thermal aging cycles. It has been found that DP of\nall samples was 1100 ±15 in the pre-aging period.\nIt is clear from Table 1, that the DP of Kraft papers has been\ndecreased to be approximately 50% from its value in the pre-\naging tests. These results agree with previous results showed\nthat the insulating papers suffer from excessive deterioration\nin the primary stage of the thermal aging [17], [34]. It can be\nalso concluded from table 1 that, the DP of the impregnated\npapers in Parafﬁnic-based oil is slightly lower than its value\nin the case of Naphthenic one. This result can be explained\naccording to the fact that Kraft papers degrade in the case\nof Parafﬁnic-based oil with a faster rate than in the case\nof Naphthenic-based oil [35]. Not only the DP but also the\ncolor of the insulating paper differs with the change of the\noil. Fig.1 shows the changing in the insulating paper color\nafter 112 days of thermal aging. The color of Kraft papers\nimmersed in parafﬁnic oil turned to be dark brown while in\nthe Naphthenic oil they turned to be dark yellow. This change\nin color may be correlated to the different deterioration rate\nof the Kraft papers in Naphthenic and parafﬁnic oils.\nIII. PROPOSED EMPIRICAL FORMULA BETWEEN (2-FAL)\nAND DP\nBased on the experimental results presented in Table 1, a new\nempirical form has been proposed with the use of MATLAB\nVOLUME 7, 2019 102265\nR. A. A. El-Aalet al.: Prediction of Transformers Conditions and Lifetime Using Furan Compounds Analysis\nTABLE 2. Empirical form parameters.\nFIGURE 1. Variation of the color of the Kraft papers before thermal aging\ncycles (a), and after 112 days in Naphthenic (b) and Paraffinic (c) oils.\nprogram. MATLAB program can provide a mathematical\nformula between two constraints depending on the existing\nresults as explained in [36]. Equation 3 is proposed in order\nto estimate the DP for the aged Kraft insulating papers accu-\nrately after 2-FAL measuring. This empirical form is valid\nfor 2-FAL that does not exceed 12000 ppb in the case of\nNaphthenic oil and 20000 ppb in the case of Parafﬁnic oil.\nValues of a, b, c, and d constants differ with the change of the\noil type either it is Naphthenic or Parafﬁnic based oil. Table 2\nrepresents the different constants values for the two types of\nused oil.\nBy applying this new formula, Fig. 2 has been obtained.\nThis ﬁgure illustrates the graphical representation of the\nrelation between DP and 2-FAL in cases of Naphthenic and\nParafﬁnic-based oils in the previously mentioned limits of\n2-FAL. Either with the use of Fig. 2 or equation 3, one can\ndetect the value of DP that corresponds to the measured\n2-FAL and estimate the state of the insulating papers inside\nan operating transformer.\nDP=a+b(2 −FALppb)+c(2 −FALppb)2 +d(2 −FALppb)3\n(3)\nIV. VALIDATION OF THE PROPOSED EMPIRICAL FORM\nIn order to validate Equation 3, two case studies have been\nexamined. The DP values are estimated using the proposed\nformula, De Pablo formula, and Chendong formula. Sub-\nsequently, the estimated DP values are compared with the\nexperimentally measured DP in the two case studies. Thus\nthe accuracy of the proposed formula can be assessed in\ncomparison with these two widely accepted techniques.\nA. CASE STUDY I\nIn the ﬁrst case study, DP and 2-FAL had been experi-\nmentally measured for ﬁve different transformers that suf-\nfer from severe failure and could not remain in the power\nFIGURE 2. The relation between DP (y-axis) and 2-FAL (x-axis) for\nNaphthenic and paraffinic-based oil.\nnetwork anymore. The insulating oil inside these transform-\ners was parafﬁnic-based oil [33].\nTable 3, illustrates a comparison between the values of\nDP measured in [33], the DP values estimated by Chendong\nform, De Pablo form, and the proposed one. In order to assess\nthe accuracy of each method, the differences between the\nestimated (DPEst.) and the measured (DP Measu.) values have\nbeen calculated with the use of equation 4. It is obvious\nthat the estimation error of each method is calculated as the\npercentage of the experimentally measured DP. The numer-\nator of equation 4 is an absolute value in order to calculate\nthe magnitude of the difference between the estimated and\nthe measured DP values regardless that the value is positive\nor negative. Thus, one can compare between the different\nmethods on the same bases.\nEstimation error ={|DPEst. −DPMeasu.|/DPMeasu.}×100\n(4)\nThe calculated estimation error in the cases of Chengdong,\nDe Pablo, and the proposed form for the ﬁve transformers is\nillustrated graphically in Fig. 3. It is clear that the proposed\nformula has error values less than Chendong form in all\ncases. The proposed formula is more accurate than De Pablo\nformula in three of the ﬁve evaluated transformers, i.e., with\na percentage of 60% from the whole cases. Thus, it can\nbe concluded that the proposed formula gives an accurate\nestimation of the DP values in compared to Chendong and\nDe Pablo forms in this case study.\nB. CASE STUDY II\nLeibfried et al. [37] introduced a database for more than\nthirty ﬁve transformers that operate in a German power net-\nwork. These transformers have been classiﬁed into three main\ncategories. The ﬁrst category includes generation step-up\ntransformers. The second category includes grid-power\ntransformers. The ﬁnal category includes 16.7 Hz railway\ntransformers. In this database not only the age of each trans-\nformer but also voltage rate, complex power, 2-FAL amount,\nand average DP of the insulating papers have been mentioned.\nIn the present research the measured data of the ﬁrst category\n102266 VOLUME 7, 2019\nR. A. A. El-Aalet al.: Prediction of Transformers Conditions and Lifetime Using Furan Compounds Analysis\nTABLE 3. Comparison between Chendong form, De Pablo form, and the proposed formula (Case study I).\nFIGURE 3. Comparison between the estimation error values in\nChengdong, De Pablo and the proposed formula (case study I).\nof transformers is used to assess the accuracy of the three pre-\nviously mentioned formulas used to estimate the DP values in\nterms of the measured 2-FAL.\nThe ﬁrst category has been chosen because in this category\n250 ≤DP ≤935. However, in the second category 442 ≤DP\n≤942 and in the third category 189 ≤DP ≤542. Thus, it\nis clear that the ﬁrst category includes different transformers\nwith a wider range of DP values compared to the other\ntwo categories. Consequently, one can assess the accuracy\nof the different DP estimation formulas not only for the\naged transformers but also for relative new ones. As the type\nof the insulating oil used in each transformer has not been\nmentioned in [37], DP has been estimated by the proposed\nformula for both Parafﬁnic and Naphthenic-based oil.\nDepending on the results obtained in table 4, four two-\nside comparisons have been conducted as shown in Fig.4.\nThe ﬁrst comparison is between Chendong and the proposed.\nformula in the case of Parafﬁnic oil. The second comparison\nis between De Pablo and the proposed formula in the case of\nParafﬁnic oil. The third comparison is between Chendong and\nthe proposed formula in the case of Naphthenic oil. The ﬁnal\ncomparison is between De Pablo and the proposed formula in\nthe case of Naphthenic oil.\nIt can be concluded from Fig. 4 that, the proposed formula\nyield more accurate DP estimations with error values less than\nthe other two formulas in all comparisons except the ﬁrst one.\nFIGURE 4. Four Comparisons between the proposed formula, Chendong,\nand De Pablo methods (case study II).\nIn the second comparison, the proposed formula in the case\nof Parafﬁnic oil gives accurate DP estimation more than De\nPablo’s formula in seven cases out of the thirteen test cases.\nSimilar results were obtained in the fourth comparison. The\nproposed formula in the case of Naphthenic oil gives more\naccurate DP estimation than De Pablo method in seven cases\nout of the thirteen examined cases. Thus it can be said that the\nproposed formula archives more accurate DP estimation for\nboth Parafﬁnic and Naphthenic oil compared to De Pablo’s\nformula in 54% of the whole test cases.\nIn the third comparison, the proposed formula in the case\nof Naphthenic oil gives accurate DP estimation compared to\nChendong method in eight cases of the thirteen testes cases.\nHowever, in the ﬁrst comparison Chendong formula gives a\nmore accurate DP estimation compared to the proposed for-\nmula in case of Parafﬁnic oil in seven cases out of the thirteen\nexamined cases. Thus it can be said that the proposed formula\narchives more accurate DP estimation for both Parafﬁnic and\nNaphthenic oil compared to De Pablo’s formula in 54% of the\nwhole test cases.\nVOLUME 7, 2019 102267\nR.

Comparison between Chendong form, De Pablo form, and Proposed formula (Case study II).\nIn the third comparison, the proposed formula in the case\nof Naphthenic oil gives accurate DP estimation compared to\nChendong method in eight cases of the thirteen testes cases.\nHowever, in the ﬁrst comparison Chendong formula gives\na more accurate DP estimation compared to the proposed\nformula in case of Parafﬁnic oil in seven cases out of the\nthirteen examined cases.\nIt can be generally concluded from the two previously\nmentioned case studies that, the proposed empirical formula\npresented in the current research gives accurate DP estimation\nresults in comparison with Chendong and De Pablo formulas.\nV. PREDICTION OF THE REMAINING LIFETIME OF AN\nOPERATING TRANSFORMER USING THE PROPOSED\nEMPIRICAL FORMULA\nDP and 2-FAL values have been measured for different trans-\nformers that operate in Abo Sultan power plant in Egypt.\nThis power plant contains six transformers that are classiﬁed\ninto three main groups. The ﬁrst group includes the two\nmain transformers in the plant. The second group includes\ntwo startup transformers. Finally, the third group includes\ntwo auxiliary transformers. The insulating oil inside these\nsix transformers is Naphthenic-based oil. As a result, DP has\nbeen estimated in relation with the measured 2-FAL by using\nthe proposed formula. Next, the estimated values are com-\npared to the measured values in order to assess the accuracy\nof the proposed formula another time. DP has been measured\nfor these transformers while they were in maintenance.\nThe error between the estimated and the measured DP\nvalues for the six transformers is presented in Table 5. The\nerror has been calculated by equation 4. It is obvious from\nTable 5, that the proposed formula yield accurate predictions\nwith an estimation error that does not exceed 7% from the DP\nmeasured values. It can be also concluded that the ﬁrst ﬁve\ntransformers have insulating papers with relatively good DP\nvalues. These DP values indicate that these transformers have\na moderate aging rate. However, the last auxiliary transformer\nhas an extensive deterioration rate in its insulating paper\nsystem as the measured DP is lower than 450 [38]–[40].\nThus, the remaining lifetime of this transformer has to be\n102268 VOLUME 7, 2019\nR.

Data of under evaluation transformers in Abo Sultan steam power plant (validation of Eq.3).\ninvestigated in order to avoid any sudden failure in its insula-\ntion system due to the aging process.\nIn order to estimate the remaining lifetime of a trans-\nformer, the deterioration rate of its insulating system has to\nbe taken into account. This deterioration rate is correlated to\nthe change in the DP value of the insulating papers inside this\ntransformer. As the changing in DP value can be estimated\nby Furan compounds analysis, the recorded results of Furan\ncompound tests must be studied. Previous literatures had also\ndepended on Furan test analysis in order to determine the\nremaining lifetime of operating transformers [29], [40]–[42].\nTable 6 presents the measured Furan compounds and\nalso the 2-FAL for the investigated transformer since Jan-\nuary 2013 until January 2015. With the using of these ﬁve\n2-FAL measurements an empirical formula is obtained. This\nempirical formula is used to estimate the aging rate of the\ninsulating paper inside this transformer for the next years.\nEquation 5 shows the empirical formula that is used\nto estimate the amount of 2-FAL produced as a result of\npaper degradation inside the power transformer. This formula\nenables the user to calculate the 2-FAL knowing of the age of\nthe transformer. Values of x, y and z constants differ for each\ntransformer as every transformer has its own aging rate. In the\ncase of the second auxiliary transformer in Abo Sultan station\nx =13169.05, y =- 826.337 and z =16.662. These constants\ncan be determined for any other transformer by studying the\namount of 2-FAL produced inside it.\n2 −FAL(ppb) =x +y(t) +z(t)2 (5)\nwhere t: transformer age at sampling time (years).\nEquation 5 has been experimentally validated by estimat-\ning the amount of 2-FAL at different sampling times since\nJanuary 2016 until January 2019. Then, the estimated val-\nTABLE 6.

Equation 6 shows that the estimation error in\nthis case is calculated as a percentage from the 2-FAL Measu.\nexactly as in the DP case. It is obvious from Table 7 that the\nsuggested formula gives 2-FAL accurate estimation with an\nestimation error that does not exceed 2% from the measured\nvalues.\nError ={|2−FALEst. −2−FALMeasu.|/2−FALMeasu.}×100\n(6)\nDepending on equations 3 and 5 which have been proved\nto give accurate estimations, the remaining lifetime of the\nassessed transformer in Abo Sultan power plant can be\ncalculated. The insulating oil inside this transformer is\nNaphthenic-based oil. Therefore, DP can be calculated by\nequation 3 and with the use of the constants presented in\nVOLUME 7, 2019 102269\nR. A. A.

(validation of Eq.5).\ntable 2. By substituting the 2-FAL term in equation 3 with its\nvalue in equation 5, a new relation can be obtained between\nDP and the operating age of the assessed transformer as\nshown in equation 7. This equation can estimate the DP of the\ninsulating paper inside the auxiliary transformer in relation\nwith the age of this transformer. The value of the constants\nrepresented in equation 7 belongs to the assessed transformer\nand differ from one transformer to another.\nDP =α+β(t)+γ(t)2 +δ(t)3 +λ(t)4 +ζ(t)5 +η(t)6 +κ(t)7\n(7)\nwhere t: transformer age at sampling time (years).\nα:166.63843 β:−4.793216\nγ :2.2588904 δ:−0.088332514\nλ:0.000950421 ζ :−1.6065814 ×10−6\nη:1.57627 ×10−8 κ :−6.5894446 ×10−11\nTable 8 introduces the DP prediction of the insulat-\ning papers inside Abo Sultan auxiliary transformer since\n2012 until 2027. It is worthy to be mentioned that the\nDP estimated in the period between 2012 and 2015 is\n393.5≤DP≤423. This estimation matches with the DP value\nthat has been already measured in 2013 and represented\nin table 5. The estimated DP values have been graphically\nrepresented in Fig.5 in order to assess the change in the slope\nwhich indicates the rate of change in the DP values during\ndifferent time periods. The state of the insulating papers has\nbeen presented in table 8 depending on the classiﬁcation that\nis previously introduced in [21], [38]–[40].\nIt is commonly known that the insulating paper sys-\ntem suffers from moderate deterioration if 450 ≤DP≤1000.\nIf 250 ≤DP≤450 the insulating paper seems to face an exten-\nsive deterioration problem. Critical state is the description\nof the insulating paper situation if the DP value decreased\nto be less than 250. Finally, it is a completely dangerous\ndecision to keep a transformer in service while the DP value\nis less than 200 as it indicates that the insulating papers inside\nthis transformer suffer from unstoppable deterioration and\nhave no mechanical strength [21], [38]–[40]. Thus the end\nof transformer life can be identiﬁed as the instance at which\nthe DP of its insulating papers reduced to be lower than 200.\nTABLE 8. Estimated DP and corresponding insulating papers state of the\nauxiliary transformer unit (B).\nFIGURE 5. Estimated DP values of the insulating papers inside the\nAuxiliary transformer unit (B) in Abo Sultan power plant in Egypt.\nThis deﬁnition is only concerned about the insulating papers\nstate. According to this deﬁnition, it can be noticed that\nthe assessed transformer cannot remain in service after\nApril 2027.\nVI. RESULTS ANALYSIS\nDepending on the results presented in this paper, a new tech-\nnique can be suggested in order to estimate the remaining life-\ntime of any operating transformer. The proposed technique\ncan be summarized by the ﬂowchart shown in Fig. 6. The\nﬁrst step is to study the relation between previously measured\n2-FAL values and the transformer age at the dates of these\nmeasurements. Thus, one can identify the deterioration rate\nof the insulating papers. This step is required to create a math-\nematical form as equation 5 by using MATLAB program.\nThis form enables the users to predict the 2-FAL that will\nbe emitted from the insulating papers in the upcoming years.\nIn the present research, the mathematical formula has been\nsuggested depending on ﬁve 2-FAL measurements imple-\nmented in the period between 2013 and 2015 for an operating\ntransformer. Then, it has been validated by estimating the\n2-FAL in the period between 2016 and 2019 and comparing\nthe estimated values with the already measured values at\nthe same period. The error between the estimated and the\n102270 VOLUME 7, 2019\nR. A. A. El-Aalet al.: Prediction of Transformers Conditions and Lifetime Using Furan Compounds Analysis\nFIGURE 6. Flowchart illustrates the suggested scenario that can be used\nto estimate maximum transformer lifetime.\nmeasured values did not exceed 1.63% from the measured\nvalue as shown in Table 7. Finally, the estimated 2-FAL values\nare substituted in equation 3 to calculate the DP of the trans-\nformer insulating paper. If the estimated DP is higher than\n200, the transformer can remain in service. These two steps\nare repeated until reaching the instance when the DP value\nbecomes lower than 200. This instance can be considered as\nthe end of the transformer lifetime.\nIn the current research, the second step has been merged\nwith the ﬁrst one and presented in equation 7. This equation\nhas connected the transformer age directly with the DP of\nits insulating papers. In order to check the state of the insu-\nlating paper inside the auxiliary transformer in Abo Sultan\nstation, the 2-FAL amount will be measured annually and this\nmeasured value will be compared with values estimated by\nequation 5. This comparison is implemented to check whether\nthe transformer can stay in service until 2027 as predicted or\nnot.\nFIGURE 7. Atmospheric air leakage in the transformer under-study [43].\nIn a previous research, the reasons of the extensive deteri-\noration that takes place inside the paper insulating system of\nthe auxiliary transformer unit (B) in Abo Sultan power plant\nhave been studied [43]. It has been stated that atmospheric air\nleakage was the main cause of the deterioration that occurred\nto the insulating system. A small gas void had been explored\nin the cover of the transformer as shown in Fig.7 during the\nmaintenance of the whole transformers in Abo Sultan power\nplant in 2013. The other transformers had been vacuumed\nthen ﬁlled with Nitrogen under pressure 3 psi (pounds per\nsquare inch). The investigated transformer had been brought\nto service without maintenance as a case study. Due to this\nair leakage, the results of the dissolved gas analysis test\nthat implemented periodically to the investigated transformer\nindicated a sudden increase in the dissolved gases quantities\nand also in CO 2/CO ratio. Thus, special care had been taken\nto this transformer and also the demand to predict its remain-\ning lifetime had been increased. In order to be on the safe\nside, the transformer will be brought out of service when its\ninsulating system will be in the critical state. According to\nTable 8, it is estimated that the insulating system will reach\nthe critical state at 2024.\nVII. CONCLUSION\nThe present research introduced two important new points.\nThe ﬁrst one is an empirical formula that can predict DP\nof insulating papers as a function of the measured 2-FAL.\nThis suggested formula has been validated by comparing\nthe estimated DP values with experimental results obtained\nin two different case studies. It has been proved that the\nproposed empirical formula presented accurate estimations\nof DP values compared to Chendong and De Pablo models\nin the two case studies examined in this paper.\nThe second point represented in this research is a proposed\nframework that has been implemented in order to predict the\nmaximum lifetime of an operating transformer that serves in\nAbo Sultan power plant in Egypt. The insulating paper system\ninside this transformer seemed to face a serious problem.\nThe relation between 2-FAL and the transformer age has\nbeen studied and used to predict the 2-FAL at any age of the\nassessed transformer. Then, the estimated values of 2-FAL are\nused to predict the corresponding DP. It 1has been stated that\nthis transformer cannot remain in service after 2027.\nFor more safety, Furan compounds analysis will be con-\nducted annually for this transformer. Measured 2-FAL will\nVOLUME 7, 2019 102271\nR. A. A. El-Aalet al.: Prediction of Transformers Conditions and Lifetime Using Furan Compounds Analysis\nbe compared with value estimated by equation 5 to check\nwhether the transformer will run in the estimated track or not.\nFurthermore, the transformer will be brought out of service\nwhen DP of its insulating papers reaches 250 instead of 200.\nREFERENCES\n[1] A.
