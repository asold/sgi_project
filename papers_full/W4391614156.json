    "abstract": "The highway construction industry carries substantial safety risks for workers, necessitating thorough accident analyses to implement effective preventive measures. Current research lacks comprehensive investigations into safety incidents, relying heavily on conventional statistical methods and overlooking valuable textual information in publicly available databases. This study leverages a state-of-the-art large language model (LLM), specifically OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 model. The primary focus is to enhance text-based incident analysis that is sourced from OSHA’s Severe Injury Reports (SIR) database. By incorporating novel natural language processing (NLP) techniques, dimensionality reduction, clustering algorithms, and LLM prompting of incident narratives, the study aims to develop an approach to the analysis of major accident causes in highway construction. The resulting cluster analysis, coupled with LLM summarization and cause identification, reveals the major accident types, such as heat-related and struck-by injuries, as well as commonalities between incidents. This research showcases the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and LLM technology in data-driven analysis. By efficiently processing textual data and providing insightful analysis, the study fosters practical implications for safety professionals and the development of more effective accident prevention and intervention strategies within the industry.",
