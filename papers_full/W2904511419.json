The conc ept of nanofluids, proposed \nby Choi of Argonne National Laboratory in 1995 [1], and the \nsubsequent development of transformer oil-based nanofluids \n(TNFs) by Segal et al  in 1998 [2], has helped improve the \nperformance of these devices. TNFs are stable colloidal \nsystems, obtained by dispersing nanoparticles with diameters \nof less than 100 nm into traditional transformer oil, using \nmethods such as magnetic stirring and ultrasonic oscillation. \nResearch indicates that TNFs  exhibit better characteristics \nthan traditional transformer oil in terms of their suitability for \nuse as liquid dielectrics, with respect to parameters such as \nwithstand voltage, thermal conductivity, and anti-aging and \nmoisture resistance properties [3–5]. Electrical \ncharacterization, including investigations determining AC/DC \nbreakdown voltage, lightning impulse voltage, and PD voltage \n[6, 7], also reveals that the insulating characteristics of TNFs \nare considerably better than those of traditional transformer \noils. \nCharge carriers are particles that move freely within a liquid \ndielectric, with the conduction current being generated by this  \ndirectional motion. The carrier transport characteristics of \nliquid dielectrics thus affect their insulating properties [8], and \ncan be analyzed through measurement of the conduction \ncurrent. Carrier mobility, which is the ratio of the carrier \nmigration velocity to the electr ic field strength, can also be \nused in analysis of the trans port characteristics of charge \ncarriers.  \nManuscript received on 25 February 2018,  in final form 24 July 2018, \naccepted 25 July 2018.

For the measurement of the conductivity of liquid \ndielectric under high electric field, W. F. Schmidt first \nsummed up the elementary processes which is closely linked \nwith the initiation and the propagation of electric breakdown \nprocesses in liquids, including: electrode processes, ionizatio n \nin the liquid phase, bubble formation, and evolution of the \nbreakdown phenomenon [10]. Butcher tested and analyzed the \nconduction process of the pure transformer oil under the high \nfield [11]. The conductivity process is divided into three \nstages, which are resistance stage, tunnel effect stage and \nspace charge limiting current satu ration stage, respectively. \nThe change of conduction current of transformer oil and the \ninfluence of various factors on the transformer oil were \ndiscussed in detail by Zhou et al  [ 1 2 ] .  B u t  t h e  i n f l u e n c e  o f  \ntunneling effect on the conduction process is ignored. Negri \nand others have studied the conductivity of the magnetic fluid \n[13], but due to the addition of ferromagnetic nanoparticles, \nthe stability is greatly influenced by the voltage level, and t he \nconductivity characteristics of the space charge limiting \ncurrent saturation stage are not measured. \nAt present, explanations for the influence of nanoparticles \non the insulating properties of transformer oils, and \nmechanisms controlling these modifications, are disputed. The \nbehavior of a dielectric in an electric field, from electrical \nconduction to electrical break down processes, is strongly \nrelated to carrier transport characteristics [14]. Carrier moti on \nunder the influence of a DC electric field can be used to \nexplain the pre-breakdown proces s. Hence, in this study, we \ncompared the conduction current s and carrier flow fields of \nTNFs and a traditional transformer oil at different electric field \nstrengths, prior to breakdown. We analyzed the carrier \ntransport characteristics based on this information, to explain  \nthe enhancement in insulation resulting from the addition of \nnanoparticles, and clarify the mechanisms controlling this \nmodification. \n2 EXPERIMENT  \n2.1 PREPARATION OF TRANSFORMER OIL-BASED \nNANOFLUIDS \nIn this study, we used ZnO nanoparticles as the colloidal \ncomponent of the TNFs. The surfaces of the nanoparticles \nwere treated with oleic acid, to reduce agglomeration. In order  \nto observe the morphology and uniformity of ZnO prepared by \nhydrothermal synthesis method, a representative transmission \nelectron microscopy (TEM) image of the ZnO nanoparticles is \nshown in Figure 1, revealing a uniform size distribution. The \naverage particle diameter is approximately 20 nm. The X-ray \ndiffraction (XRD) patterns shown in Figure 2 illustrate the \npurity of the ZnO particles, which were grown along the C-\naxis via a hydrothermal reaction. In addition, we observe the \nstandard hexagonal wurtzite crystal structure in these particles.  \n \nFigure 1.  Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the ZnO \nnanoparticles. \n \nFigure 2. X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the ZnO nanoparticles. \nWe used Karamay 25 #, a mineral transformer oil, as the \nbase fluid for the TNFs. Prior to nanoparticle dispersion, this  \nwas dried in a vacuum oven at 85 °C for 48 h. The water \ncontent was 8 ppm, measured using a Karl Fischer micro \nwater tester. A flowchart of the nanoparticle dispersion \nprocess is shown in Figure 3. In summary, varying \nconcentrations of ZnO particles were added to a transformer \noil base. The solution was mixed for 10 min using a magnetic \nstirrer, followed by 30 min of ultrasonication, to obtain TNFs \nwith a uniform distribution of nanoparticles. \n \nFigure 3. Flowchart of nanoparticle dispersion process. \n2444\nY. Li et al.: Investigation on Charge-Carrier Transport Characteristics of Transformer Oil-based Nanofluids\n \nWe produced TNFs with nanop article concentrations of \n0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 g/L, suitable for obtaining electrically \ninsulating characteristics. The TNFs were treated in a vacuum \noven at 80 °C for 48 h, to reduce the influence of dissolved \nwater and air on the behavior of the dielectrics, and the water  \ncontent was 6 ppm.  \n2.2 CONDUCTION CURRENT MEASUREMENT \nPLATFORM \nWe measured the conduction current of the samples in a \nparallel plate configuration, using copper electrodes with a \ndiameter of 25 mm. The two electrodes were separated by a \ndistance of 1 cm. We used a Keithley 6517B electrometer with \nan operational range from 10 mA to 21 mA for this electrical \ncharacterization. In addition, we included an overload \nprotection circuit, composed of two antiparallel diodes, to the  \nsystem, to prevent damage to the electrometer caused by the \nbreakdown of the test sample. A schematic of the conduction \nmeasurement system is shown in Figure 4. \n \nFigure 4. Schematic of conduction measurement system. \nDifferent DC voltages were applied to the sample during the \nmeasurement of dielectric conduction current, according to the \nIEC 60247 and IEC 61620 standards. As space charge \nmigrates to the positive and negative poles under the influence  \nof an electric field, the current flowing through the sample is  \ngradually reduced to a limit value following DC voltage \nexcitation. The time-dependent changes in the conduction \ncurrent of the traditional transf ormer oil and a TNF (0.1 g/L),  \nmeasured at room temperature (25 °C) at different electric \nfield strengths, are shown in Figure 5. As we observed a stable \ncurrent after 30 s of excitation, in subsequent experiments, we  \ndefined the conduction current as the average of the values \nmeasured between 60 and 100 s.  \nDC voltage was applied using a step-up method, as shown \nin Figure 6. The voltage was increased from a minimum (500 \nV) to a maximum (9–13 kV), in increments of 500 V. The \nduration of excitation at each voltage increment, t, selected a s \ntwo minutes, should be greater than the time required to \nestablish a stable leakage current. Δt is the boost time, i.e.,  the \nlength of the transition between successive voltage \nincrements, which was typically 3 s long \n3  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \nAs previously stated, the directional motion of charge-\ncarriers under the influence of an electric field generates a \nconduction current. The conduction processes of TNFs can \nthus be classified according to the electric field strength. In  a \nweak electric field, TNF conduction is primarily dependent on \nionic mobility and the electrophoretic mobility of \nnanoparticles. In contrast, in a strong electric field, carrier  \nmotion is connected to processes occurring at the interface \nbetween the electrode and the dielectric.  \n \n(a) \n \n(b) \nFigure 5.

Illustration of changes in excitation used in step-up voltage method. \nConductivity γ is defined as the ratio of the current density \nof a material j to the electric field strength E, as below [15]: \n=                                                                                              (1)jγ E  \nThe relationship between the conductivity of a liquid \ndielectric, as measured by the conduction current, and the \nIEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation    Vol. 25, No. 6; December 2018\n2445\n \nelectric field strength is shown in Figure 7. Here, we mainly \nanalyze the difference between traditional transformer oil and \nTNFs with nanoparticle concentrations of 0.1 g/L. We note a \ngradual increase in conduction current as the electric field \nstrength increases. \n \nFigure 7. Characteristic E–I curves of transformer oil based dielectrics. \nFrom Figure 7, we note a negligible change in conduction \ncurrent, for weak electric fields. In contrast, in a strong electric \nfield, the rate of the increas e in current gradually accelerate s, \nand the current becomes significantly high. This discrepancy \nis a result of the different processes governing carrier motion. \nThe current density of a dielectric material is determined by \nthe density of carriers in the medium,  n\n0, the migration \nvelocity of the carriers, v, and the charge of the carriers,  q, as \nbelow: \n                                                                                   (2) 0jq n v  \nThe addition of nanoparticles to a transformer oil \nprimarily increases the carrier density, resulting in the \nenhancement of the conduction current of TNFs in a weak \nelectric field. Nevertheless, we note that, in a strong electri c \nfield, the increase in conduction current is slower with the \nTNFs than it is with traditional transformer oil, as the \nreduced mobility of carriers in TNFs suppresses the \ndevelopment of discharge, leading to an improvement in the \ninsulating strength.  \nTo further characterize the effect of nanoparticles on \ncarrier transport, we analyzed the experimentally derived \ndata using the Fowler–Nordheim plot method [16–18]. Based \non our observations, the entire process of conduction can be \ndivided into three stages: the ohmic stage, tunneling stage, \nand space charge limited current (SCLC) stage, as shown in \nFigure 8 [19]. Then, we analyzed the specific laws of \ndifferent stages and tried to explain the phenomena from the \nmotion of microscopic charged particles. \n3.1  OHMIC STAGE \nFigure 9 shows the relationship between the conduction \ncurrent of the traditional transformer oil and the TNFs, and \nelectric field strength, for weak excitation. In accordance wit h \nOhm’s law, the current is proportional to the field strength. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) \n \n(b) \nFigure 8.

E-I curves of transformer oil-based dielectrics in the ohmic stage. \nThe electrical conductivity of th e TNFs is much larger than \nthat of the traditional transformer oil, and increases with \nincreasing nanoparticle concentration. This relationship can be \ninferred from the conduction current, as conductivity is the \nr a t i o  b e t w e e n  t h e  c u r r e n t  d e n s i t y  a n d  t h e  e l e c t r i c  f i e l d  \nstrength, and it is equivalent to the product of carrier densit y, \ncarrier charge, and carrier mobility μ [20, 21]: \n2446\nY.

After adding nanoparticles, electrical charge can be \nadsorbed onto the surface of nanoparticles in TNFs. Hence, as \nwell as molecules of alkanes , or ions dissociated from \nimpurities, charge carriers in TNFs include the colloidal \nnanoparticles. Thus, carriers of transformer oil-based \nnanofluids are much larger, and increasing the nanoparticle \nconcentration increases the carrier density and conductivity of  \na TNF. The diversity of charge carriers means that the \nmobility of ions and the electrophoretic mobility of \nnanoparticles in TNFs are both involved in the process of \nconduction in this stage.  \n3.2  TUNNELING STAGE \nUnder low electric field, the main conduction is ionic \nconduction and electrophoretic conduction. Therefore, at the \nohmic stage, the increase of nanoparticles is actually \nincreasing the electrophoretic c onduction and increasing the \nnumber of carriers. However, it is no longer only ionic \nconduction under high electric field, but the simultaneous \neffect of ions, electrophoretic  and electrons. The difference \nbetween pure oil and transformer oil-based nanofluids is \nmainly caused by the effect of nanoparticles on the electrons.  \nIn view of the general law of conduction of pure oil, electric \ncurrent increases expon entially with electric field under high \nelectric field. That is to say, there are lots of charged parti cles \nin the liquid. Assuming that the ionic conduction still plays a  \nmajor role under high electric field without the effect of \nelectrons, it can be thought that the increase of electric current \nis caused by the increase of ionic mobility or ions dissociation. \nNow these two possibilities are discussed. \nWhen the positive ions A, B, C vibrate at the lowest \npotential energy, the vibration frequency is \n . If the thermal \nvibration energy exceeds the binding barrier of the molecule, \nthen the ion migrates. When E=0, ion concentration \n0n  has six \ndirections, and the ion concentration of each transition may be \n0n /6. In one direction, the number of ions n  that can \novercome the potential barrier transition to the new \nequilibrium position every second can be calculated. \ne                                                                                  (5)\n\n\nu\n0 kTnn ν6\n \nTake the x axis as an example.

But the transformer o il is basically broken \ndown under this condition. Then it can be considered that the \nmobility does not change with the electric field. \nFor ionic dissociation, concentration of ions can be \ncalculated by Equation 15. It does not change exponentially \nwith the electric field. \ne e e                                             (15)\n\n\n3\na\n0r\neEu\nπε ε2kT aE00 2kT\n0\nN νnA ξ\n \nTherefore, the conduction under high electric field is \ndifferent from that in low electric field, and it is no longer just \neffected by ions. Based on previous studies, we believe that \nelectrons emitted from the elect rodes will have an effect on \nconduction at high electric field [20]. In this stage, the curr ent \nand electric field strength satisfy the following equation: \nexp /                                                                (16)  2IK E B E  \nwhere K a n d  B are constants of proportionality. The \nrelationship between ln(I/E2) and E-1 can be plotted as a \nstraight  line.  F or  T NFs , t he  gradient is −16, which is steeper \nthan the gradient calculated with the traditional transformer oil \n(−2.455). This gradient can be determined analytically, as \nfollows:  \n                                                                                 (17) \n3χεB 2d  \nwhere χ is the electron affinity barrier, Δd is the barrier \nthickness, and ε is the relative permittivity of the dielectric. \nThe electron affinity barrier ref lects the energy required to \nfree electrons at the bottom of the conduction band of an \nelectrode. As the electrodes are surrounded by transformer oil, \nand the electrode material does not change, the electron \naffinity barrier remains constant. An approximately 100-nm-\nthick interface is formed when a metal electrode comes in \ncontact with a dielectric. Interface barriers, A and C, also \nappear, as shown in Figure 11 [22]. The interaction of charges \nin the interface creates a double layer, in which the electric \nfield can be as high as 10\n3 MV/m [23]. \nFor transmission to the dielectric, the energy of the \nelectrons should be greater than the height of barrier A. \nAlternatively, electrons can tun nel through this region when \ntheir de Broglie wavelength is greater than the thickness of the \nbarrier. These electrons increase the conduction current of the  \ntransformer oil. Hence , in moderate electric fields, electronic  \nconductivity from field emission is the primary factor that \ndictates the conduction current of transformer oils. The \nprimary effect of the addition of nanoparticles is to increase \nthe thickness of the potential ba rrier. As a result, the number  \nof electrons transmitted to the interface region is reduced, an d \nbreakdown is suppressed. \nAnalysis of the transition from the ohmic stage to the \ntunneling stage revealed that the electric field strength \nrequired to induce tunneling increased from 0.6 kV/mm to 1.5 \nkV/mm, following the addition of the nanoparticles. This \ndiscrepancy can be explained u sing the interaction between \nZnO particles and electrons. As  the nanoparticles in the TNF \nare capable of electron capture, the electric field in the regi on \nof the electrodes is weakened and the velocity of the electrons  \nis subsequently reduced. A higher electric field is thus needed  \nto provide the electrons with sufficient kinetic energy to leav e \nthe electrode and enter the inte rface, delaying the onset of th e \ntunneling stage.  \nAs in the ohmic stage, under the influence of an electric \nfield, nanoparticles in the TNF act as carriers, as they are \ncharged through electron capture. The kinetic energy of these \nparticles is transferred to the  oil molecules in the process of  \ncollision. This transfer of momentum moves the liquid \nmolecules in the direction of the  carriers. To analyze carrier \nmotion more intuitively, we ob served the velocity field of \nTNFs under DC excitation, using particle image velocimetry. \nDetails regarding the parameters used in this experiment are \navailable from our previous work [24].  \nBased on the results of velocimetry, the average speeds of \nTNF flow in the electrode region were approximately 2.156, \n4.317, and 7.962 mm/s, for DC excitations of 10, 15, and 20 \nkV, respectively. The relationship between the voltage and \nvelocity is plotted in Figure 13.  \nFrom Figure 13, we note that the velocity of TNF flow \nincreases with increasing electr ic field strengt h, as suggested  \nby our considerations of transfers in momentum. This increase \n2448\nY. Li et al.: Investigation on Charge-Carrier Transport Characteristics of Transformer Oil-based Nanofluids\n \nin velocity is accelerated when the conduction phase changes \nfrom the ohmic stage to the tunnel stage, indicating an \nincrease in carrier mobility with e lectric field strength. The \ncarrier concentration also increases, as the number of electrons \ninjected into the dielectric is increased. \n \nFigure 13. Analysis of flow rate of TNFs with respect to electric field \nstrength. \n3.3  SPACE CHARGE LIMITED CURRENT STAGE \nIn addition to increases in the free carrier migration velocity \nand charge injection from the electrode, application of a strong \nelectric field causes carrier multiplication in the dielectric and \nspace charge accumulation. As the applied voltage is \nincreased, if the electrode inj ection current is not equal to t he \nbody drift current I\nb, excess charges are generated in the \ndielectric, which are trapped  by carriers to form the space \ncharge. When the electric fiel d generated by the space charge \nis balanced with the external electric field, the injection \ncurrent reaches a steady state. In this region, the current in the \ndielectric is termed SCLC. For traditional transformer oil, if \nelectron capture by space charge t raps is ignored, the current \nand electric field satisfy the Mott–Gurney Law [25]: \n                                                               (18)   \n20μεε S9IE 8d\n \nwhere ε is the dielectric constant of the transformer oil (2.2), d \nis the size of the oil gap (1.5 mm), and μ is the apparent carrier \nmobility. \nTo verify the transition to the SCLC stage, we plotted the \ncurrent with respect to the square of the electric field, as in \nFigure 14.  \nWe note that the current is directly proportional to the \nsquare of the electric field strength, as is typical of SCLC. The \ncarrier mobility in this region was calculated to be 2.93×10 -5 \ncm2/(Vꞏs). The inclusion of na noparticles increases trapping \ndensity, such that the effects of electron capture in TNFs \ncannot be ignored. In stead, a coefficient a  is introduced as a \ncorrection factor related to trap density, given as \n=                                                                                   (19)\na\nt\nnθ nn\n \nFigure 14. Plot of E 2-I for the traditional transformer oil under large electric \nfield excitation. \nwhere nt is the density of trap s introduced by the \nnanoparticles, and n is the intrinsic trap density of the base \nfluid. When the space charge trap density is less than 1, the \nmobility of carriers in TNFs can be calculated as \nn                                                                                  (20) a0μθ μ  \nwhere μ0 is the carrier mobility of the base fluid. \nWith TNFs, we observe a proportional relationship between \ncurrent and the square of the electric field, as shown in Figur e \n15. The carrier mobility in this  region was calculated to be \na p p r o x i m a t e l y  2 . 2  ×  1 0-5 c m2/(Vꞏs). The trap density is 1.5 \ntimes that of traditional transfor mer oil, which is consistent \nwith the results presented by Yuefan et al. [26]. \n \nFigure 15. Plot of E2–I curve for TNFs under high electric field excitation. \nThe addition of nanop articles increases the density of traps \nin TNFs. In a strong electric field, electrons produced by \nionization are constantly being trapped and released in the \ncourse of motion, impeding their migration. Thus, \nnanoparticles inhibit carrier mobility, explaining the differin g \nbehaviors of TNFs and transformer oil in the SCLC stage. \n4  CONCLUSIONS \nIn this study, the transport ch aracteristics of carriers in \nTNFs, under the influence of electric fields of different \nIEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation    Vol. 25, No. 6; December 2018\n2449\n \nmagnitudes, were obtained, by analyzing the conduction \ncurrent and the velocity field of the fluids. From these \nanalyses, we explained the effect of nanoparticles on the \nelectrical properties of transformer oil, and clarified the \nmechanisms dictating these modifications. We identified three \ndistinct conduction mechanisms in TNFs, depending on the \nmagnitude of the electric field. In considering these \nmechanisms, we divided the evolution of conduction with \nelectric field into three stages: ohmic, tunneling, and SCLC. \nIn the ohmic stage, the current (I) is primarily dependent on \nfree carrier motion, and it is proportional to the electric fie ld \nstrength (E). The addition of nanoparticles increases the \nnumber of electrophoresis, resulting in an increase in the \nconduction current.  \nIn the tunneling stage, the relationship between electric field \nstrength and current is also more complex: ln(I/E\n2) is \nproportional to E-1. With the increase in e lectric field strength, \nthe effect of electrons emitted by the electrodes can’t be \nignored.  And the carrier mobility gradually increases, in \ncontrast to the ohmic stage. The addition of nanoparticles \nincreases the thickness of the barrier at the electrode-dielect ric \ninterface, reducing the number of electrons transmitted to this  \nregion. This increase in barrier  thickness increases the field \nstrength of the transition from the ohmic stage to the tunnelin g \nstage.  \nI n  t h e  S C L C  s t a g e ,  t h e  c u r r e n t  ( I )  i s  p r o p o r t i o n a l  t o  t h e  \nsquare of the electric field strength (E\n2). The addition of \nnanoparticles increases the density of traps in the transformer \noil, which impede carrier motion. These traps thus reduce \ncarrier mobility, suppressing the occurrence of discharge.  \nFrom the above three stages, we can find that although the \nnanoparticles increase the conductivity at the low field \nstrength stage, the contribution of nanoparticles to the \ninhibition of breakdown is more prominent at the higher \nelectric field. In order to  i m p r o v e  t h e  m e c h a n i s m  o f  \nnanoparticle modification, more comprehensive tests from \ndifferent angles of materials are certainly necessary in future  \nworks, including the inhibition effect of nanoparticles on the \nmotion charge in transformer oil, the boundary effect of anti-\nmoisture, anti-aging and strengthening effect in the field of \nheat conduction.  \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nThis project was supported by the National Natural Science \nFoundation of China (Grant Nos. 51777157 and 51507130) \nand the National Key Research and Development Program of \nChina (Grant No. 2017YFB0902705). \nREFERENCES \n[1] C.
