    "abstract": "Dissolved gas analysis (DGA) is a powerful tool to diagnose transformer condition. Some internal fault can be depicted with the amount of generated gases or the ratio of some generated gases. This paper will discuss about generated gas tendency for two degradation level of insulating paper under low temperature overheating. Low temperature overheating simulation is conducted in several level of overheating temperature, 75 – 200 oC with 25 oC interval. New insulating paper (DP1040) has different behavior than bad degraded insulating paper (DP390) regarding to CO2 generation but has similar behavior regarding to CO generation as function of temperature. At low temperature overheating, degradation speed of new insulating paper is faster than bad degraded insulating paper.",
