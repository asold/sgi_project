    "abstract": "In academic writing, citations play an essential role in ensuring the attribution of ideas, supporting scholarly claims, and enabling the traceability of knowledge across disciplines. However, the manual process of citation generation is often time-consuming and prone to errors, leading to inconsistencies that can undermine the credibility of academic work. The novel approach explored in this study leverages advanced machine learning techniques to automate the citation generation process, offering a significant improvement in both accuracy and efficiency. Through the integration of contextual and semantic features, the model demonstrates a superior ability to replicate complex citation patterns, adapt to various academic disciplines, and generate contextually appropriate citations with high precision. The results of rigorous experiments reveal that the model not only outperforms traditional citation tools but also exhibits robust scalability, making it well-suited for large-scale academic applications. This research contributes to the field of automated academic writing, providing a powerful tool that enhances the quality and integrity of scholarly communication.",
