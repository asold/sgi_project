  "abstract": "Abstract. The task of assigning geographic coordinates to web resources has recently gained in popularity. In particular, several recent initiatives have focused on the use of language models for georeferencing Flickr photos, with promising results. Such techniques, however, require the availability of large numbers of spatially grounded training data. They are therefore not directly applicable for georeferencing other types of resources, such as Wikipedia pages. As an alternative, in this paper we explore the idea of using language models that are trained on Flickr photos for finding the coordinates of Wikipedia pages. Our experimental results show that the resulting method is able to outperform popular methods that are based on gazetteer look-up. 1",
