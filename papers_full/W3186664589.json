  "abstract": "In this paper the results of the tests of the wideband transformation accuracy of medium voltage (MV) inductive voltage transformers (VTs) in the frequencies range from 50 Hz up to 5 kHz are presented. The values of voltage error and phase displacement for transformation of the harmonics of distorted primary voltages are determined. In the case of a typical 50 Hz-type inductive VT with a rated primary voltage equal to (15/√3) kV and (20/√3) kV manufactured by an international company the limiting values of the accuracy classes extension for quality metering required by the standard IEC 61869-6 for the Low Power Instrument Transformers (LPIT) were not exceeded. While, in the same test other MV inductive VTs show poor accuracy and even resonance at multiple frequencies. Unfortunately, this problem also arises from nonlinearity of the magnetization characteristic of their magnetic core. Therefore, for transformation of the sinusoidal voltage in the secondary voltage significant but not easily detectable values of the low order higher harmonics are present. Moreover, for transformation of harmonics of distorted primary voltage the influence of connected capacitance on the obtained values of voltage error and phase displacement was tested.",
