INTRODUCTION \nLast decade saw an increasing interest among power \nelectronic researchers in resonant dc -dc converters with \nintegrated magnetics due to their excellent efficiencies at \nmedium and heavy load conditions, fewer passive component \ncount and high power-density capabilities [1], [2]. Yet, only few \nresearch has been pursued to understand the effects of change in \nthe value of leakage inductance as the frequency is swept across \nthe operating range of a frequency -controlled converter, or to \ninvestigate th e effects of inductance ratio (magnetizing \ninductance /leakage inductance) on the voltage gain and \nefficiency of the converter at various loads and other operating \nconditions. These existing knowledge gaps are largely due to the \nstatic nature of transforme rs that characterizes a constant \nleakage and magnetizing inductance at any given frequency. \nThis paper introduces the concep t of a novel variable \ninductance transformer (VIT) whose leakage and magnetizing \ninductances can be varied dynamically and independently across \nwide user-defined ranges. Fig. 1 shows the concept of a  shell-\ntype VIT that is constructed with two ungapped E-shaped ferrite \ncores. The primary and secondary windings of the VIT are \nwound around two custom -made bobbins that have a  height \nsignificantly smaller than the height  of the winding window  \n \n(ℎ <  𝐻). The leakage inductance of the VIT can be varied by \nvarying the extent of overlap 𝑔 between the two bobbins . The \nmagnetizing inductance of the VIT can be varied by varying the \nlength of air gap 𝐺 between the two E cores , which in turn \nchanges the reluctan ce of the magnetic flux path. By using \nseparate controls for 𝑔 and 𝐺, the two inductances can be varied \nindependently. \nIn this paper, analytical models of the variable leakage and \nmagnetizing inductances of the VIT are presented. A 3D Finite \nElement Method (FEM) model of the VIT is designed and its \nleakage inductance is evaluated for various overlaps. Further, an \nexperimental prototype of a unity turns ratio VIT is constructed \nwith solid round conductors and its  leakage and magnetizing \ninductances are mea sured for various  overlaps and airgaps , \nrespectively. Finally, the analytical, FEM and experimental \nresults are analyzed and compared for validation of the work. \nII. ANALYTICAL MODELLING OF THE VIT \nA. Variable Leakage Inductance Model \nLeakage inductance of a transformer can be calculated from \nthe leakage energy stored inside and outside its volume when \nperfectly opposed magnetomotive forces (MMFs) are applied to \nthe two windings [3], i.e., 𝑁1𝐼1 = 𝑁2𝐼2, where 𝑁1 and 𝑁2 are the \nnumber of primary and secondary turns, and 𝐼1 and 𝐼2 are the \nprimary and secondary currents, respectively . Hence, \ncalculation of leakage inductance is inherently a three -\nThis material is based upon work supported by the Department of Energy \nVehicle Technologies Office under Award Number DE-EE0008449. \n \nFig. 1. Variable Inductance Transformer (VIT). \n\ndimensional (3D) problem . FEM can calculate the leakage \ninductance very acc urately, but at the expense of high \ncomputational effort, especially for 3D FEM [3], [4]. For multi-\nobjective optimization -based designs of isolated converters, \nanalytical leakage inductance  models having a lower \ncomputational effort with no significant loss in accuracy are \npreferred [5], [6]. \nSeveral analytical and semi-analytical models can be found \nin the literature that scale the leakage inductance per unit length \nevaluated across a single 2D plane inside the winding window \n(Single-2D model) using t he mean length turn (MLT) of the \nwindings to obtain the total leakage inductance of the \ntransformer [6]–[13]. Most of these models are based on the \nmagnetic image method, which considers the core as a reflective \nmedium for any current-carrying conductor placed near it. More \ndetails about the magnetic image method can be found in [14]. \nA double-2D model was introduced recently [3], [15], where \nthe leakage inductance per unit length is evaluated across two \nplanes⎯the inside window (IW) plane and the outside window \n(OW) plane⎯hence the name “Double -2D”. Total leakage \ninductance is obtained by adding the product of the two leakage \ninductances per unit length and their respective partial winding \nlengths, called leakage lengths. Partial leakage lengths \nessentially act as scaling factors for the leakage inductances per \nunit length. Hence, the accuracy of the model depends on the \naccurate evaluation of the two leakage inductances per unit \nlength and the two partial leakage lengths. Double -2D models \nare very promising because they can  accurately calculate the \nleakage inductance  even when the winding height is \nsignificantly smaller than the window height.  Fig. 2 illustrates \nthe concept of the Double -2D model, where the IW and OW \nplanes are marked using blue lines. A transition (TR) regi on is \nidentified between an IW and an OW region, which is crucial \nfor the accurate estimation of the partial leakage lengths. \nThe general form of the Double-2D model can be written as,  \n𝐿𝑙𝑘,Double-2D = 𝑠𝑐(𝐿2D(IW)\n′ 𝑑𝑙(IW) + 𝐿2D(OW)\n′ 𝑑𝑙(OW)) (1) \n𝑠𝑐 = {1, core-type transformer\n2, shell-type transformer  \nwhere, 𝐿2𝐷(IW)\n′  and 𝐿2𝐷(OW)\n′  are the leakage inductances per \nunit length across the IW and OW planes, and 𝑑𝑙(IW) and 𝑑𝑙(OW) \nare the partial leakage lengths for the IW  and OW regions, \nrespectively. Methods to calculate these leakage inductances per \nunit length and partial leakage lengths are discussed below. \n1) Calculation of leakage inductances per unit length \nThe two basic shapes of conductors used for winding \ntransformers are round conductors and rectangu lar foils. The \nequations for calculating the field intensities for these two \nconductor shapes can be found in [3]. Round or Litz wire \nconductors can be approximated as square conductors of equal \ncross-sectional area to simplify the formulations in the Cartesian \ncoordinate system [16]. The calculation of leakage inductances \nper unit length begins with the determination of the exact \nlocations of all conductors in the IW and OW planes. To achieve \na variable leakage inductance, 𝑔 should be varied by moving   \n \nFig. 2. Double-2D model. \n \nFig. 3. Magnetic field intensities obtained from the 3D FEM model  at 𝑔 = 0 \nmm: (a) IW plane, and (b) OW plane. \n \nFig. 4. Image windows resulting from the magnetic image method: (a) IW \nplane, (b) OW plane. \n\none of the two bobbins vertically along the central core leg, as \nindicated in Fig. 1. As such, the 𝑦-coordinates of all conductors \nin the movable bobbin should include 𝑔 as a variable. \nThe IW plane is bounded by the core on four sides, as shown \nin Fig. 3 (a). These four sides act as two pairs of reflective media \n(mirrors) for a single conductor located in this plane, thereby \nresulting in an infinite number of image conductors in both 𝑥 \nand 𝑦 directions, as illustrated in Fig. 4 (a). The location s of \nthese image conductors can be determined using [3]. Therefore, \nat any point 𝑃(𝑥,𝑦) in the IW plane, the total field intensity 𝐻⃗⃗ 𝑃\n𝑘 \nin 𝑘 direction due to a single conductor and its images is,  \n𝐻⃗⃗ 𝑃\n𝑘(𝑥,𝑦) = ∑ ∑ 𝐻⃗⃗ 𝑃(𝑖,𝑗)\n𝑘 (𝑥,𝑦)+𝑚\n𝑖=−𝑚\n+𝑛\n𝑗=−𝑛  (2) \nwhere, 𝑚 → ∞, 𝑛 → ∞, 𝐻⃗⃗ 𝑃(𝑖,𝑗) is the field intensity at 𝑃(𝑥,𝑦) \ndue to a conductor in the (𝑖,𝑗)th window, 𝑖 = 𝑗 = 0 represents \nthe original window, and 𝑘 represents either 𝑥 or 𝑦 direction.  \nThe OW plane , on the other hand,  is bounded by the \nreflective core on one side only, as shown in Fig. 3 (b). As such, \na single conductor located in this plane yields one image \nconductor only, as illustrated in Fig. 4 (b). Therefore, at any \npoint 𝑄(𝑥,𝑦) in the OW plane, the field intensi ty 𝐻⃗⃗ 𝑄\n𝑘  in 𝑘 \ndirection due to a single conductor and its image is, \n𝐻⃗⃗ 𝑄\n𝑘(𝑥,𝑦) = 𝐻⃗⃗ 𝑄(original)\n𝑘 (𝑥,𝑦) + 𝐻⃗⃗ 𝑄(image)\n𝑘 (𝑥,𝑦) (3) \nThe total field intensities across the IW and OW planes due \nto all conductors and their respective images is, \n𝐻⃗⃗ 𝑃(all)\n𝑘 (𝑥,𝑦) = ∑ 𝐻⃗⃗ 𝑃\n𝑘(𝑥,𝑦)all   (4) \n𝐻⃗⃗ 𝑄(all)\n𝑘 (𝑥,𝑦) = ∑ 𝐻⃗⃗ 𝑄\n𝑘(𝑥,𝑦)all   (5) \n𝐻𝑃(all)\n2 (𝑥,𝑦) = (𝐻⃗⃗ 𝑃(all)\n𝑘=𝑥 (𝑥,𝑦))\n2\n+ (𝐻⃗⃗ 𝑃(all)\n𝑘=𝑦 (𝑥,𝑦))\n2\n (6) \n𝐻𝑄(all)\n2 (𝑥,𝑦) = (𝐻⃗⃗ 𝑄(all)\n𝑘=𝑥 (𝑥,𝑦))\n2\n+ (𝐻⃗⃗ 𝑄(all)\n𝑘=𝑦 (𝑥,𝑦))\n2\n (7) \nBy setting perfectly opposed MMFs in the two windings, the \nleakage energies per unit length can be calculated using, \n𝐸2D(IW)\n′ =\n1\n2 𝜇0 ∫ ∫ 𝐻𝑃(all)\n2 (𝑥,𝑦)\n𝑤\n0\nℎ\n0 𝑑𝑥𝑑𝑦 (8) \n𝐸2D(OW)\n′ =\n1\n2 𝜇0 ∫ ∫ 𝐻𝑄(all)\n2 (𝑥,𝑦)\n∞\n0\n∞\n−∞ 𝑑𝑥𝑑𝑦 (9) \nwhere, 𝑤 and ℎ are the width and height of the winding window.  \nIf 𝐼 is the primary current , then the leakage inductance per \nunit length across the IW and OW  planes can be  finally \ncalculated using,  \n𝐿2D(IW)\n′ =\n2𝐸2D(IW)\n′\n𝐼2   (10) \n𝐿2D(OW)\n′ =\n2𝐸2D(OW)\n′\n𝐼2   (11) \n2) Calculation of partial leakage lengths \nA partial leakage length is a function of the magnetic energy \ndistribution across a plane [15]. First, the energy-weighted mean \nlengths are calculated for the IW and OW planes using, \n𝑙(IW) = 𝑟𝑐 +\n∫ ∫ 𝑥.𝐻𝑃(all)\n2 (𝑥,𝑦)𝑤\n0\nℎ\n0 𝑑𝑥𝑑𝑦\n∫ ∫ 𝐻𝑃(all)\n2 (𝑥,𝑦)𝑤\n0\nℎ\n0 𝑑𝑥𝑑𝑦\n (12) \n𝑙(OW) = 𝑟𝑐 +\n∫ ∫ 𝑥.𝐻𝑄(all)\n2 (𝑥,𝑦)∞\n0\n∞\n−∞ 𝑑𝑥𝑑𝑦\n∫ ∫ 𝐻𝑄(all)\n2 (𝑥,𝑦)∞\n0\n∞\n−∞ 𝑑𝑥𝑑𝑦  (13) \nwhere, 𝑟𝑐 is the radius of the circular central core leg around \nwhich concentric windings are wound.  \nFor a circular core leg wound with concentric windings, the \npartial leakage lengths are also circular. With respect to Fig. 2, \nthe angles subtended at the center o f the central core leg (EC -\ntype core) by the IW, TR and OW regions are,  \n𝜃(IW) = 2sin−1 (\n𝑟𝑐\n𝑤+𝑟𝑐\n)  (14) \n𝜃(TR) = sin−1 (\n2𝑟𝑐\n𝑙(IW)+𝑙(OW)\n) −\n𝜃(IW)\n2  (15) \n𝜃(OW) =\n2𝜋−𝑠𝑐(𝜃(IW)+2𝜃(TR))\n𝑠𝑐\n  (16) \nIn this work, the TR region is equally divided between an IW \nand an OW region. Therefore, the angles subtended at the center \nof the central core leg by the IW and OW regions of the Double-\n2D model are, \n𝛼(IW) = 𝜃(IW) + 𝜃(TR)  (17) \n𝛼(OW) = 𝜃(OW) + 𝜃(TR)  (18) \nThe angles 𝛼(IW)  and 𝛼(OW)  are calculated intuitively in \n[13], [15]. Finally, the energy-weighted partial leakage lengths \ncan be calculated for the IW and OW regions using,  \n𝑑𝑙(IW) = 𝑙(IW)𝛼(IW)  (19) \n𝑑𝑙(OW) = 𝑙(OW)𝛼(OW)  (20) \nB. Variable Magnetizing Inductance Model \nThe variable magnetizing inductance of the VIT is calculated \nby solving its magnetic equivalent circuit for various airgaps 𝐺. \nFig. 5 represents the magnetic equivalent circuit of the VIT. ℛ𝑐 \nrepresents the reluctance of the core across various segments and \nℛ𝑔 represents the reluctance of each air gap. If 𝐿 is the length of \nthe core,  𝐴core  is the cross -sectional area,  𝜇𝑟  is the relative \npermeability of the core, and 𝜇0  is the permeability of free \nspace, then the reluctance of the core can be calculated using,  \n \nℛ𝑐 =\n𝐿\n𝜇𝑟𝜇0𝐴core   (21)  \nThe fringing magnetic flux around each air gap must be \nconsidered for accurate results. If 𝐴gap is the cross-sectional area \nof the air gap, then the f ringing flux factor can be calculated \nusing [17], \n𝐹 = 1 +\n𝐺\n√𝐴gap\n𝑙𝑛 (\n2𝐿\n𝐺 )  (22) \nThe reluctance of the air gap considering fringing flux is,  \nℛ𝑔 =\n𝐺\n𝜇0𝐹𝐴gap\n  (23) \nℛ𝑐 and ℛ𝑔 must be calculated for each segment of the flux \npath. Finally, the total reluctance ℛ of the flux path is, \nℛ = (ℛ𝑐1 + ℛ𝑐11 + ℛ𝑐12 + ℛ𝑐21 + ℛ𝑔1)||(ℛ𝑐2 + ℛ𝑐22 +\nℛ𝑔2)||(ℛ𝑐3 + ℛ𝑐33 + ℛ𝑐32 + ℛ𝑐23 + ℛ𝑔3) (24) \nIf 𝑁1 is the number of primary turns, then  the magnetizing \ninductance can be calculated for any 𝐺 using, \n𝐿𝑚 = 𝑁1\n2 ℛ⁄   (25) \nIII. RESULTS \nDesign specifications of the VIT assumed for this work are \npresented in Table I. The height of the bobbins is significantly \nlower than the height of the window (= 44.6 mm for EC 70 core) \nto ensure that there is enough room for moving one of the \nbobbins vertically along the core leg. Only single layer windings \nare considered to demonst rate the concept of VIT, but non -\ninterleaved multilayer windings can also be used. \nA. Analytical Model \nThe Double -2D model used for obtaining the analytical \nsolutions of the variable leakage inductance is simplified by \nassuming a layer of round conductors as a single rectangular foil \nhaving a width equal to \n𝑑√𝜋\n2  [16], where 𝑑 is the diameter of the \nround conductor specified in Table I. From (1), it can be inferred \nthat the a ccuracy of the Double -2D model  depends on the \naccurate evaluation of the two leakage inductances per unit \nlength as well as the two partial leakage lengths. At 𝑔 = 0 mm, \nthe VIT represents a conventional transformer having a \ncomplete overlap between the primary and secondary windings. \nThe leakage inductances per unit length and the partial leakage \nlengths are evaluated for the conventional transformer case and \npresented in Table II for validation of the model. All analytical \nresults are obtained using MATLAB R2019a. The leakage \ninductance per unit length across the IW plane is evaluated by \nconsidering the 24 nearest images to the original window , i.e. \nthe two full layers of images shown in Fig. 4 (a). \nB. FEM Model \nA 3D FEM model of the VIT  is designed in COMSOL \nMultiphysics 5.5 to investigate the accuracy of the Double -2D \nmodel. The FEM model is wound with rectangular foils that \nhave a width equal to \n𝑑√𝜋\n2 , as stated above. Figs. 3 and 6 plot the \nmagnetic field intensities across the IW and OW planes at 𝑔 = \n0 mm and 𝑔 = 10 mm, respectively. It is evident from these two \nfigures that the field intensities in Fig. 6 is much higher than \nthose in Fig. 3. \nThe partial leakage lengths are not readily available from the \nFEM model.  To investigate the accuracy of the analytically \ncalculated partial leakage lengths, a horizontal cut line is plotted \nalong the width of each plane that always passes through the \ncenter of the overlapped winding. The energy -weighted mean \nlengths are then calculated using, \n𝑙(IW) = 𝑟𝑐 +\n∫ 𝑥.𝐻2(𝑥)𝑤\n0 𝑑𝑥\n∫ 𝐻2(𝑥)𝑤\n0 𝑑𝑥   (26) \n𝑙(OW) = 𝑟𝑐 +\n∫ 𝑥.𝐻2(𝑥)∞\n0 𝑑𝑥\n∫ 𝐻2(𝑥)∞\n0 𝑑𝑥   (27) \nThe angles subtended at the center of the central core leg by \nthe IW and OW regions, and consequently the partial leakage \n \nFig. 5.

The \nresults obtained from the 3D FEM model  are considered as \nstandards for comparing the model errors presented in Table II. \nThe variable magnetizing inductance of the VIT is not modelled \nin FEM because th e analytically calculated values of the \nmagnetizing inductance are in full agreement with the \nexperimentally measured values. \nC. Experimental Model \nAn experimental model of the VIT is deigned according to \nspecifications and is depicted in Fig. 7. Two ungapped E-shaped \nferrite cores are used to build the shell-type transformer. Perfect \nround conductors  are used to construct the transformer \nwindings. Although either bobbin may be used as the movable \none to vary 𝑔, this specific work uses the narrow bobbin as th e \nmovable one for mechanical reasons. A single linear actuator is \nused to move the narrow bobbin vertically along the central core \nleg, while two identical linear actuators are used to move the \nupper E core vertically in order to vary 𝐺. Speed of the linear \nactuators can be controlled using the operating voltage. \nAccording to specifications, the linear actuators exhibit a speed \nof approximately 15 mm/second at 12 V. In this work, the linear \nactuators are operated at 4 V to achieve a speed of 5 mm/second. \nUsing a microcontroller, the linear actuators can be operated for \ndefinite time intervals to achieve the desired 𝑔 and 𝐺. An LCR \nmeter is used to measure the  leakage and magnetizing \ninductances of the experimental model at 1 kHz test frequency. \nA high precision digital gauge, having a resolution of 0.01 mm, \nis used for measuring 𝑔 and 𝐺. \nD. Variable Leakage Inductance \nFig. 8 plots the variation of analytically calculated, FEM \nsimulated, and experimentally measured values of the leakage \ninductance with 𝑔. From Table II, it is evident that the Double- \n \n2D model is fairly accurate for cal culating the leakage \ninductance of a conventional transformer where 𝑔 = 0 mm. But \nthe same may not be inferred for 𝑔 > 0 mm, as indicated by the \nblack curve in Fig. 8, which shows that the error between the \nanalytically evaluated and FEM simulated values of the leakage \ninductance increases with 𝑔. The main reason for this error is \nthat the image method -based Double -2D model is an ideal \nmodel that neglects the fringing flux across the edges of a \nconductor. In order to limit the error at 𝑔 > 0 mm, a correction \nfactor 𝑘𝑡 is introduced in this paper, where \n𝑘𝑡 = √1 + 𝑔\nℎ⁄   (28) \nTherefore, the corrected leakage inductance of the VIT can \nbe analytically calculated using, \n𝐿𝑙𝑘,VIT = 𝑘𝑡 × 𝐿𝑙𝑘,Double-2D  (29) \nThe correction factor could reduce the error significantly \nbelow 2.35 % (observed at 𝑔 = 4 mm), as indicated by the blue \ncurve in Fig. 8. As 𝑔 goes from 0 to 10 mm, the leakage \ninductance of the experimental model increases from 13.2 µH to \n23.8 µH. The FEM simulated values of the leakage inductance \nclosely follow the experimentally measured values and a \nmaximum error of 3.64 % can be observed at 𝑔 = 0 mm. \nE. Variable Magnetizing Inductance \nFig. 9 plots the variation of analytically calculated and \nexperimentally measured values of the magnetizing inductance \nwith 𝐺. As 𝐺 is increased from 0.1 to 5 mm, the reluctance of \nthe flux path increases and the magnetizing inductance of the \nexperimental model drops from 868.5 µH to 61 µH. The \nanalytically calculated magne tizing inductance closely follow \nthe experimentally measured values with a maximum error of \n1.82 % observed at 𝐺 = 0.75 mm. \n \nFig. 6.

This is because a change in \nairgap changes the areas of the IW and OW planes under \ninvestigation. Nevertheless, the range of overlap is too small to \ncause any significant effect on the leakage inductance. Thus, the \nleakage inductance and the magnetizing inductance of the VIT \ncan be controlled independently.  \nIV. CONCLUSION \nThe key contributions of this paper are: a) introduction to the \nconcept of variable inductance transformer, b) analytical \nmodelling of the variable leakage and magnetizing inductances, \nc) design of an experimental prototype, and d) validation of the \nanalytical models using 3D FEM simulations and experimental \nmeasurements. The leakage inductance of t he experimental \nmodel increased from 13.2 µH to 23.8 µH as the extent of \noverlap between the two windings was reduced by 10 mm. \nAgain, the magnetizing inductance of the experimental model \ndropped from 868.5 µH to 61 µH as the airgap between the core \nlegs w as increased by 4.9 mm. The two  inductances were \ncontrolled independently and dynamically across their specified \nranges using linear actuators . The analytical model of the \nvariable leakage inductance exhibited a maximum error of 2.35 \n%, while that of the v ariable magnetizing inductance showed a \nmaximum error of 1.82 %. The proposed concept of the VIT can \nalso be extended to other transformer core geometries and non-\ninterleaved multilayer windings.  VIT can prove to be a \nbeneficial tool for the advancement of  research in resonant \nconverters. \nREFERENCES \n[1] J. H. Jung, H. S. Kim, M. H. Ryu, and J. W.
