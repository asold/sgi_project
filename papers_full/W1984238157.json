  "abstract": "This paper deals with experimental investigations of the electrical and physical properties of oil impregnated insulation paper for power transformers at different temperatures. The ac breakdown voltage, tensile strength and water content of insulation papers impregnated in mineral oil for different time periods were investigated. The effect of insulation paper thickness on the electrical and mechanical properties has also been studied. The results showed that the breakdown voltage and the tensile strength decreased with increasing the time of immersion of insulation paper in oil at room temperature, at 5℃ and at -12℃. Also, the thermal aging effect on the characteristic of insulation paper has been studied. It was found that high temperatures affect the breakdown voltage and the tensile strength to a great extent.",
