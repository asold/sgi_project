Introduction \nAboriginal stone artefacts of symbolic, artistic and cultural significance are recognised \nthroughout Australia, attesting that many stones have meaning beyond a simple utilitarian \n2 E. Hayes et al. \n \nJournal of Lithic Studies (2020) vol. 7, nr. 3, 17 p. DOI: https://doi.org/10.2218/jls.3088 \npurpose (see Taçon 1991). Engraved or deliberately incised stones may functi on as abrading \nor filing stones but also as symbolic items with clearly defined imagery. Brumm et al.  (2006) \nprovide a global review of stones with engraved or incised lines that have been interpreted as \nitems of functional or symbolic significance. Utilitarian tools with incised lines from \nAustralia include morah stones, which are large flat grinding stone slabs with deeply incised, \nparallel lines for processing toxic nuts in northeastern Queensland rainforests; and “bone \nshaping stones”, known mostly from  the east coast and south -eastern Australia and used to \nmake bone points (McCarthy 1976). McCarthy (1976) illustrates a range of incised stones. Dr. \nDan Witter (personal communication with Dan Witter in November 2015) documented a \ncalcarenite specimen in southwestern Victoria in the late 1970s, and interpreted its likely \nfunction was to grind small bone points. Towle (1944) reported an incised sandstone slab \nfrom coastal New South Wales and suggested that it may have been used for sharpening the \npoints of spears. \nIn this paper, we describe a ground stone artefact, identified during an archaeological \nsalvage program undertaken in Bannockburn, southwestern Victoria ( Spry et al . 2019; \nTuechler & Spry 2015) (Figure 1). The artefact is an abrasively smoothed, tabular fragment of \nsandstone with 14 evenly spaced grooves (eight on one side and six on the other). Our aim is \nto determine how the artefact may have been used and to evaluate the potential significance of \nthe grooves. The life history of this artefact and interpretations of its possible function and \nsignificance were reconstructed from use- wear and residue analyses, comparisons with \nexperimental replica tools and records of incised stones in archaeological and museum \ncollections. This project has been undertaken in collaboration with the Wathaurung \nAboriginal Corporation (WAC). WAC represents members of the Wadawurrung, the \nTraditional Owners of central southwestern Victoria. \n \n2. Bannockburn archaeological salvage program \nThe Bannockburn archaeological salvage program was carried out in compliance with an \napproved Cultural Heritage Management Plan, prepared ahead of stormwater drainage works \nassociated with a recently constructed subdivision (Light & Tuechler 2014). The  works area \nwas located on Bruce Creek, which forms the interface between sedimentary plains to the \nwest and basalt plains to the east. Bruce Creek dissected these plains during the Holocene, \nresulting in the exposure of underlying Oligocene limestone and marl  and the accretion of \nalluvial silts (Robinson et al. 2003). \nNumerous cultural resource management studies have been undertaken in the \nBannockburn area, and have identified surface and subsurface stone artefacts as a common \noccurrence in the Bruce Creek corridor (e.g., Clark 2010; Hyett & Marshall 2007; Marshall & \nPaynter 2003; Tuechler & Spry 2016). Based on these data, Tuechler & Spry (2016: 44- 45) \ndetermined that the area was a focus of Aboriginal occupation and related activities, including \n(1) the production and use of stone tools (both ground and flaked) and (2) the fashioning and \ncuration of wooden implements. The presence of ochre at two Aboriginal sites may indicate \nthe use of pigment either in ceremonies or for activities such as animal skin pr ocessing (e.g., \nDickson 1981; Griffin et al. 2013). \n \n \nE. Hayes et al. 3 \n \nJournal of Lithic Studies (2020) vol. 7, nr. 3, 17 p. DOI: https://doi.org/10.2218/jls.3088 \n  \nFigure 1. Site location showing Salvage Excavation Pit 1 (SEP1), site VAHR 7721-1241 and Bannockburn. \n\n4 E. Hayes et al. \n \nJournal of Lithic Studies (2020) vol. 7, nr. 3, 17 p. DOI: https://doi.org/10.2218/jls.3088 \nThe ground stone artefact GS491 that is the subject of this paper was identified in \nfloodplain deposits on the eastern side of Bruce Creek, where an artefact scatter is registered \nwith Aboriginal Victoria as VAHR 7721-1241. This Aboriginal site was documented initially \nby Light and Tuechler (2014: 94- 95, 100), at which time 65 flaked stone artefacts made on \nquartz (n = 26; 40%), quartzite (n = 22; 34%), microcrystalline silcrete (n = 15; 23%) and \nfine-grained silcrete (n = 2; 3%) were identified. The artefacts occurred in alluvial silts to a \ndepth of 540 mm below the surface and across an area of 2,167 m² ( i.e., the extent of VAHR \n7721-1241). Based on subsurface testing carried out at the time, the site VAH R 7721-1241 \nwas estimated as having an average subsurface stone artefact frequency of 16.07 artefacts per \ncubic metre (by volume) and 10 artefacts per square metre (by area, Table1). \n \nTable 1: VAHR 7721-1241 Artefact density (based on subsurface testing undertaken by Light & Tuechler (2014) \nand Tuechler & Spry (2015)). \nStage of investigation \nExcavated \nSediment \nVolume (m³) \nExcavated \nArea (m²) \nNo. of \nArtefacts \nAverage no. \nof Artefacts \nper m² \nAverage no. \nof Artefacts \nper m³ \nCHMP 4.045 6.50 65 10 16.069 \nSalvage program - \nmanual excavation \n5.200 8.00 179 22.375 34.423 \nSalvage program - \nmechanical stripping \nplus monitoring \nnot applicable 2152.50 560 0.260 not \napplicable \nTotal 9.245 2167.00 804 32.635 50.492 \n \nEight square metres of the site VAHR 7721- 1241 were excavated by hand and the \nremainder of the site was excavated by mechanical stripping and monitored to recover \nartefacts. Soils from hand and machine excavation were sieved through 5 mm mesh in order \nto recover artefacts. The manual excavation recovered on average 22.38 stone artefacts per \nsquare metre (n = 179; 24%). The ground stone artefact (GS491) was recovered from Layer 1, \nSpit 2, Quadrant A of Salvage Excavation Pit 1 (SEP1) -  one of two 2 x 2 m pits excavated \nmanually at VAHR 7721- 1241 (Figure 2). SEP1 was excavated in 100 mm spits until a \nculturally sterile, mottled black and orange clay was encountered at a depth of 580 mm below \nsurface. The overlying floodplain sediments comprise brown, dry and weak- friable silt, 0-440 \nmm below surface (Layer 1); and a brown, dry and friable -cemented silt, 440-580 mm below \nsurface (Layer 2). Minor evidence for bioturbation in both layers includes insects, grass \nrootlets and small tree roots. However, the presence of refitted sets of flaked stone artefacts, \ntogether with several groups of artefacts whose visual characteristics ( e.g., colour, texture, \ncortex, inclusions) suggest each group was struck from the same core or tool, indicate that \nthese sediments are reasonably intact and not greatly disturbed (Tuechler & Spry 2015:10- 15, \n25). While no age estimates are available for the excavated alluvial silts, or the materials they \nencase, previous studies indicate that these silts were deposited during the Holocene \n(Robinson et al. 2003). \nIn total, 739 stone artefacts were retrieved from site VAHR 7721 -1241 during the \nsalvage program, bringing t he total number of artefacts identified at this site to 804 \n(supplementary data: Table 2: Proportions of different artefact and tool types identified at site \nVAHR 7721-1241 during the CHMP and salvage investigations). A large proportion of the \nsalvaged artefacts (n = 560; 76%) were identified during monitoring and mechanical stripping \nof sediments. Quartz is the most common material in the salvage assemblage (n = 341; 46%), \nfollowed by silcrete (n = 332; 45%), quartzite (n = 46; 6%), sandstone (n = 9; 1%), crystal \nquartz (n = 2; <1%) and other raw materials (n = 4; <1%). None of the ochre has macroscopic \nE. Hayes et al. 5 \n \nJournal of Lithic Studies (2020) vol. 7, nr. 3, 17 p. DOI: https://doi.org/10.2218/jls.3088 \nevidence of surface modification, such as grinding marks, and it is not possible to determine \nwhether any ochre was intended for symbolic or utilitarian pur poses. Of the flaked stone \nartefacts, silcrete and quartz appear to have been treated differently. The silcrete was \ntransported to the activity area in a smaller or more prepared form (compared with quartz), \nand worked more heavily to produce a range of informal and formal tools that include \nnotched artefacts, utilised flakes, backed artefacts and a variety of scrapers. In contrast, the \nquartz was brought to the site as unworked pebbles or cobbles and reduced less heavily \n(compared with silcrete), and occas ionally on an anvil, to only produce informal tools (Light \n& Tuechler 2014:99-111; Tuechler & Spry 2015: 22-38). \n \n \nFigure 2. Upper, Stratigraphic profile of Salvage Excavation Pit 1. Lower, Base of Salvage Excavation Pit. \n \n3. Artefact description \nGS491 comprises two sandstone fragments (broken prior to excavation), that refit to \nmake a complete but small ground stone artefact with distinctive macroscopic features, \nincluding rounded margins, extensively smoothed surfaces and 14 incised grooves, six on \nSurface 1 and eight on Surface 2 (Figure 3). Microscopically, all surfaces of the tool appear to \nhave been abrasively smoothed to some degree, probably to shape the tool into a desired \nform. The stone is a weakly cemented, relatively soft sandstone -  the type of material that is \neasy to work and typically very effective at sharpening and filing implements made of stone, \nbone or wood (Hayes 2015). Four of the near parallel grooves on Surface 1 and five of the \n\n6 E. Hayes et al. \n \nJournal of Lithic Studies (2020) vol. 7, nr. 3, 17 p. DOI: https://doi.org/10.2218/jls.3088 \nnear parallel grooves on Surface 2 are similar  in length, width and depth, although they \nappear to be slightly deeper on Surface 1. The grooves are oriented differently on each of the \nSurfaces and, on Surface 1, two macroscopically visible grooves are shorter and oriented \ndifferently from other grooves on that side. \n \n \nFigure 3. Grinding stone specimen 491 with distinctive grinding wear, including areas of abrasion and \nmacroscopically visible grooves. A -B) Surface 1: note the four parallel grooves running perpendicular to the \nfresh break; C-D) Surface 2: note the five parallel grooves running parallel to the fresh break. Scale bar is 5 cm. \n \n4. Experimental replica tools \nTo determine how the grooves were made on grinding stone GS491, we analysed use -\nwear and residues and compared our findings to two expe rimentally ground replica tools \nincised with three different materials: stone, wood and bone. Both experimental tools were \nmade of soft, weakly cemented sandstone that was similar to GS491 in composition ( e.g., \ngrain size and nature of cementing matrix). T he experimental sandstone pieces were shaped \nby hard hammer percussion and then abrasively smoothed on all surfaces, using a harder \nsandstone grinding slab (Figure 4A-C) Grooves were made on each surface of both stones and \ntheir length, width, depth and position were made to replicate the grooves on GS491 ( Figure \n4D-F). On the first sandstone piece, Tool 1, Surface 1 grooves were created with a bone point \nmade from macropod fibula ( Figure 4D). Grooves on Surface 2 on Tool 1 were made with a \nflint flake (edg e angle 25°, Figure 4E). On Tool 2, Surface 1 grooves were created using a \nretouched flint flake (edge angle 80°, Figure 4F). Grooves on Surface 2 of Tool 2 were \ncreated using dry wood ( Eucalyptus leucoxylon ). We selected yellow gum for our wood \n\nE. Hayes et al. 7 \n \nJournal of Lithic Studies (2020) vol. 7, nr. 3, 17 p. DOI: https://doi.org/10.2218/jls.3088 \nexperiments because it grows locally in southwestern Victoria and it was selected by \nAboriginal people to make wooden implements in the recent past (Kamminga 2002). Quartz \n(which is common stone material found at the site occurring as both artefacts and unmodified \nstones) would have been just as effective as flint and has similar hardness (MOHS scale: 7). \nFlint was used here because of our supplies and its more predictable flaking properties. \n \n \nFigure 4.

Residue and use-wear analyses \nExamination of GS491 and experimental tools involved several microscopes and lighting \narrangements. Low magnification observations (x6.7 to x45) were undertaken with an \nOlympus SZ61 ste reozoom microscope with an external fibre optic 150 Watt halogen light \n\n8 E. Hayes et al. \n \nJournal of Lithic Studies (2020) vol. 7, nr. 3, 17 p. DOI: https://doi.org/10.2218/jls.3088 \nsource (Olympus LG-PS2) and a Leica MZ16A stereozoom microscope with an automatic Z -\nstacking function. Multifocal images were obtained with a DFC320 Leica camera and stacked \nto create a focused image using Leica LAS V4.4 software. Higher magnification observations \nwere undertaken with an Olympus metallographic microscope (model BH -2) with vertical \nincident light (brightfield and darkfield) with objective lenses of x50, x100, x200, and x500 \nand polarising filters. Micrographs of wear traces were captured with an Olympus Infinity 2 \ndigital camera and stored as TIF files. \nNeither GS491 nor the experimental tool was washed prior to analysis, and handling of \nGS491 was minimised after it was identified during excavation. The archaeological tool had a \nfine layer of sediment that obscured the surface. Observations of wear and residue traces were \nmade directly on the artefact surface prior to residue removal and again after removal (which \nallowed some areas of the artefact to be cleaned). Removed material was also examined at \nhigh magnification in transmitted light. \nResidue samples were extracted with distilled water using an adjustable pipette on both \nthe archaeological and experimental tools. Samples were extracted from eight locations on the \ntool surface of GS491. Four residue samples from the experimental artefacts were analysed, \nincluding one sample from each of the grooves made with wood and bone. The two other \nresidue samples were extracted fr om outside the grooves and adjacent to where the bone and \nwood residue samples were recovered and were intended to be controls. Residue samples \nwere not extracted from grooves incised with flint as only mineral residues were expected. \nThe same method for r esidue extraction was applied to both the experimental and \narchaeological tools. Up to 100 μl of water was delivered by pipette to the sampled area, \neither along the entire length of each groove, or <1 cm\n2 for controls away from the grooves. \nThe solution w as lightly agitated with a pipette tip to dislodge firmly adhering residues and \ndrawn back into the pipette. Approximately 5- 15 μl of extracted sample was delivered on to a \nclean glass slide (wiped with acetone), covered with a clean glass cover slip that was sealed \nwith clear nail varnish in each corner. The edges of the cover slip remained unsealed so that \nwater, stains and other solvents could be added as required. \nMethylene Blue (C\n16H18N3SCI) was applied to all eight residue extractions to distinguish \nany highly degraded, damaged or morphologically indistinct plant tissues. Methylene Blue is \na water soluble dye that binds to the acidic pectins on the cellulose cell wall that are stained \nvarious shades of blue (Lillie 1976: 425; Stadelmann &  Kinzel 1972). The colour and \nintensity of the stained cellulose fibres are related to the purity of cellulose (the darker the \nblue, the more pure). Up to 5 μl of Methylene Blue were added to the residue slides and left \nfor at least 20 minutes to allow the stain to be a bsorbed. Excess stain was rinsed (by washing \nwater through the slide), and the slide was examined again in transmitted light. \n \n6. Results \n6.1. Use-wear \n6.1.1. Experimental tools \nThe experimental sandstone replica tools were easily shaped and smoothed (with in 15 \nminutes) by hard sandstone; and the flint flakes rapidly incised each groove (within 2 \nminutes). The grooves made with the acute stone edge appeared to be sharper and narrower \nthan the grooves made with the steep angled retouched edge (Figure 5M). Under high \nmagnification, the grooves made with stone displayed abundant micro- fracturing of quartz \ngrains but little or no polish development (Figure 5O). The grooves made with wood and bone \nwere much harder to create because both materials are softer than the sandstone, and shallow \ngrooves only formed after 5- 15 minutes, respectively. Macroscopically and at low \nE. Hayes et al. 9 \n \nJournal of Lithic Studies (2020) vol. 7, nr. 3, 17 p. DOI: https://doi.org/10.2218/jls.3088 \nmagnification, the grooves made with both the wood and bone were distinctly more shallow, \nbroader and not as straight than the grooves made with fli nt ( Figure 5G,J). At high \nmagnification, weakly polished surfaces could be distinguished within each of the grooves \nmade by bone and wood, but owing to the short processing times, the use -polish was at early \nstages of formation and not diagnostic of a part icular worked material. Nevertheless, in the \ngrooves made with wood, the polish displayed an even, grainy texture with some connectivity \nbut only in a very early stage of the reticular (net- like) wear pattern typical of woodworking \n(Figure 5GH). Some quartz grains had been sheared and had fresh fracture surfaces. Polish in \nthe grooves made with bone also had a grainy texture with some patches of more developed \npolish and directionality (alignments of polish and striations) but was not diagnostic of a \nparticular worked material (Figure 5K). \n \n6.1.2 Archaeological tool \nGS491 displayed very distinctive macroscopic and microscopic wear. The entire tool \nsurface has been smoothed and at least 14 incised, mostly parallel grooves are visible on the \ntwo main stone surfaces. At low magnification, individual grains appear minimally levelled \nand highly rounded with frequent grain micro- fracturing (Figure 6A-B). Macroscopically and \nunder low magnification, the grooves on GS491 are similar to those on the experimental tool \nsurfaces that were made with the steep-angled stone edge (Figure 5A). \nAt higher magnifications (x100, x200 and x500), polish on GS491 can be distinguished \non individual grains and can be attributed to use; and micro- scarring is frequently observed \n(Figure 5C-F). Figure 5C shows a quartz grain that has been freshly fractured, smoothed and \nsubsequently polished, indicating that the polished zone is not an outcome of natural \nweathering of the constituent quartz grains. Overall, the use -polish observed inside and \noutside the grooves and all sides, is variable in morphology and texture, and probably \nindicates manufacturing stages, processing of mu ltiple materials and perhaps also wear \nsustained from non-use agencies (e.g., storage and transport, trampling and deposition). \nIn the grooves, we documented a bright, well-developed reticulated use-polish commonly \nassociated with the processing of siliceous plant material (Fullagar 1991). The use -polish \ndocumented on GS491 is much more developed than wear on our experimental tool used to \nprocess wood for a short duration, but is similar to the wear on other experimental tools \n(Hayes 2015; Hayes et a l.  2018) made of the same sandstone used to sharpen dense mulga \n(Acacia sp.) wood for up to 2 hours ( Figure 5I). It is likely that dense wood was used in the \ngrooves on GS491 for durations exceeding 2 hours. \nThis use -polish is more extensively distributed  on Surface 2 ( Figure 5D-F), possibly \nindicating that this surface was used more intensively but for the same task. A brightly \nreflective polish (similar to plant working) outside of the grooves overlies patches of abrasive \nmanufacture wear, suggesting that GS491 was also used to rub objects made of wood or other \nplant tissue. Perhaps the wear outside the grooves was sustained when the stone was wrapped \nwith, or carried in a bag made of, plant material. As GS491 was identified in two pieces \nduring excavation, and the broken surfaces are slightly rounded and weathered, it is possible \nthat GS491 broke in such a travel bag before it was discarded. \n \n10 E.

Residue extractions, however, contained abundant collagen fibres that were \neasily identified, even without the aid of stains. \n \n6.2.2. Archaeological tool \nOrganic residues were generally scarce on GS491. We recovered degraded plant fibr es, \ndistinctive plant structures (starch, cellulose and phytoliths) and amorphous tissue ( Figure 6). \nRod-shaped phytoliths (rondels) were commonly documented in extractions from Surface 2 \nand may originate from the sediments. Many phytoliths appeared degra ded and have not been \nfurther analysed ( Figure 6C-D). Only one starch grain was documented across all eight \nresidue extractions (sampled from a groove on Surface 2), and cannot be taxonomically \nidentified or confidently associated with use. Most of the remaining organic tissue occurred as \nelongated fibres, indicating a possible plant origin. Fibrous bundles, which are more typical of \nbone and other collagenous residues, were absent. Applications of the stain Orange G (testing \nfor collagen) were all negative . In contrast, applications of Methylene Blue (testing for \ncellulose) were all positive, providing a confirmation that the degraded fibres and amorphous \ntissue were of plant origin (Figure  6E-F). Residue distributions outside the grooves were \nsimilar to those inside the grooves and likewise cannot be confidently be attributed to use. \n \n6.3. Functional Interpretation \nThe grooves on GS491 are totally unlike fresh abrasions or cut marks acquired during \nexcavations, sieving or ploughing events. Moreover, the und isturbed sedimentary context and \nother lines of evidence show that the incised grooves occurred prior to deposition. \n(1) The grooves are individually incised, parallel and evenly spaced incisions on both \nsides but at different orientations, all suggesting deliberate placement. \n(2) The grains within the grooves are evenly worn, suggesting that they are not recent \nincisions, and that they were all made at about the same time. \n(3) The artefact was recovered during archaeological excavations with small trowels. The \ngroove incisions are deeper than the likely marks made by accidental glancing blows from a \ntrowel. \n(4) The artefact was recovered from the upper 20 cm but in a field that has not been \nploughed and we can rule out farm machinery as an agent of damage. The incisions are not all \noriented in the same direction, do not always extend to the edge of the tool, and even a \nglancing blow from farm machinery would likely shatter the artefact into several freshly \nfractured pieces. \n(5) We did not identify any metal residues in the incised grooves or anywhere else on the \nartefact surface. Metal residues are easily distinguished microscopically. \nOur experiments indicate that the grooves on GS491 were first incised (most likely with \na steep-edged stone flake) and subsequently used, probably to guide the path of sharp- edge \nwooden objects. The initial incision with stone created even, straight lines that would be \nimpossible to achieve had the stone only been incised with wood (see Figure  5G). The use -\nwear on incised groove s of GS491 was consistent with the use -wear on experimental tools \nused to work wood for durations exceeding 2 hours (see above). \nThe presence of polish outside of the grooves suggests that the surface has been worn \nperhaps from use or from contact with the  inside of a plant -fibre bag. Given the nature of \nabrasive smoothing and the range of polish texture in and out of the grooves, it is likely that \nthis tool was in contact with other material (apart from wood or other plant). It is also \nprobable that tool users’ hands also caused some of the wear, while the tool was being held \nand used. Chemical weathering or abrasion from movement or disturbance in the depositional \nenvironment was not identified. \nE. Hayes et al. 13 \n \nJournal of Lithic Studies (2020) vol. 7, nr. 3, 17 p. DOI: https://doi.org/10.2218/jls.3088 \nA parsimonious functional explanation for the artefact form, incised grooves and wear on \nGS491 is that a sandstone fragment was selected for its size and physical properties, and was \nthen shaped by abrasive smoothing (probably with another piece of sandstone). Grooves were \nthen individually incised with a stone flak e. The tool was held in one hand and the incised \ngrooves were used to guide, hold steady and sharpen and shape the margins of carved wooden \nobjects ( e.g., spear points and boomerang edges) ( Figure 7). Use -wear on other parts ( i.e., \noutside the grooves) of GS491 suggests that it was carried in a bag made of plant tissue and \nperhaps also used to abrasively smooth not just the edges but also the broader surfaces of the \nsame wooden (or other) objects (e.g., spears and boomerangs, shields). \n \n \nFigure 7. Using the experimental replica tool to sharpen the edge of a boomerang. \n \n\n14 E. Hayes et al. \n \nJournal of Lithic Studies (2020) vol. 7, nr. 3, 17 p. DOI: https://doi.org/10.2218/jls.3088 \nThe pattern of evenly spaced incisions on both sides of the tool is unlike the pattern of \nsingle or multiple incised grooves found on other abrading stones. Indeed, the pattern of \nincised grooves has more in common with carved decoration on stones or other  objects \nthought to have ceremonial, artistic or other symbolic significance. Although we know that \nthe grooves were functionally linked with woodworking, the pattern of incisions appears to be \na deliberate design possibly to maximise use of the small sand stone tool but perhaps more \nlikely also as a form of artistic expression or to document or convey information. We can only \nspeculate on the nature of this information and the potential significance concerning the \nnumber of incised grooves, patterns of parallel grooves on both sides, what wooden edges and \nsurfaces were modified, the episodes of use or whether some meaning (e.g., empowerment) \nwas added to the tool itself, as a consequence of contact with particular wooden objects. \n \n7. Discussion \nIncised stones with a utilitarian purpose occur globally in the archaeological record and \nare generally considered to be tools used for modifying other implements, including bone \npoints, stone axes, shell hooks and beads, wooden shafts and other polished items. Other tools \nwith more complex incised lines are suggested to represent art, convey messages or be some \nform of counting or tally system. \nSymbolic stones from Australia with deliberately pecked or incised motifs include \ncylcons and tjuringa sacred stones, which are ritual implements used for ceremonial and \nsorcery purposes (McCarthy 1976: 66- 70; Mountford & Walsh 1943). “Message stones” with \ndeeply cut notches also have a symb olic function, supposedly to convey messages from their \nspecific patterning of the incised lines, much the same as wooden message sticks (Cooper \n1947). Engraved pebbles from South Australia are small, easily carried and are thought to \nhave conveyed some sort of tally (Mountford 1960). \nPortable stone engravings from dated archaeological contexts in Australia are rare. An \nincised limestone piece from Devil’s Lair in Western Australia has an estimated age of ~14 \nka, and Dortch (1976: 38) suggested that the linear, geometric design could represent an \nattempt to convey meaning, either as self -expression or communication, and provides \nevidence for early symbolic behaviour (but see Bednarik 1998). Vanderwal & Fullagar (1989) \nargued that 28 engraved notches on a Diprotodon tooth (with associated age estimates of ~28 \nka) were tally marks, perhaps to mark the lunar month (but see Langley 2020). \nAlthough some of the incised stones possess distinctly figurative imagery that clearly \nidentifies the artefact as one of symbo lic or cultural significance, many stones with incised \nlines are more enigmatic. Furthermore, many functional tools also have an added symbolic or \ncultural value. Stone points, for example, are typically manufactured and used as spear heads \nfor hunting and fighting weapons, but are also extremely important indicators of cultural \nidentity, often traded in economic exchange systems and requiring delicate craftsmanship for \ntheir manufacture (Akerman et al. 2002). The role of aesthetics in lithic manufacture ha s been \nreviewed by Taçon (1991), who identified aspects of tool manufacture as forms of art. \nAustralian ethnography has indicated that some stones with natural banding that form \ninteresting or attractive patterns are of particular symbolic and spiritual interest, and may have \nbeen deliberately selected for knapping due to their striking appearance (Brumm et al. 2006: \n184). There is sufficient evidence in Australia to suggest that many stones have a deeper, \naesthetic value beyond their function. However, det ermining whether a stone tool may have \nan additional symbolic significance is speculative, although both sacred and profane contexts \nare possible (see Hampton 1999). \nGS491 from the site near Bannockburn is enigmatic. Similar stones from around \nAustralia wi th incised lines are known for processing bone awls, nose -bones, and wooden \nE. Hayes et al. 15 \n \nJournal of Lithic Studies (2020) vol. 7, nr. 3, 17 p. DOI: https://doi.org/10.2218/jls.3088 \nspear barbs; and to convey messages (McCarthy 1976: f ig. 49, 57-60). Through use-wear and \nresidue analysis and experimental replication, we have shown that this tool probably \nfunctioned as a woodworking tool, possibly for sharpening hard wooden implements such as \nboomerangs. However, the fact that the stone appears to have been deliberately abraded on all \nsurfaces - perhaps to shape the tool in a certain way with one end relatively wide and the other \nnarrower - and the pattern of evenly spaced incised grooves together imply that there was a \ndeliberate, perhaps aesthetic or other intent. Consequently, one can speculate that this tool \nused for wood working also had some sort of additional symbolic function. \n \n8. Conclusion \nThe Bannockburn ground stone tool is an enigmatic artefact that has stimulated much \nthought and discussion about its function and potential significance. Study of use -wear and \nresidues on experimental tools indicate s that the grooves on GS491 were probably incised \nwith stone and were used to abrade wooden objects. Nevertheless, exactly how the artefact \nfunctioned as a tool or symbolic object remains speculative: the stone was probably used as a \ntool for the shaping of wooden artefacts. The pattern of incised grooves also suggests artistic \nexpression, tally marks or other messages. On the other hand, rubbing certain wooden objects \nin the incised grooves may also have empowered the stone with some symbolic meaning \n(Hampton 1999). \nArtefacts with similar incised grooves are rare and not often reported in archaeological \nsites, perhaps because artefacts like this have been simply overlooked during excavation and \nsieving. Indeed, the grooves on GS491 are subtle and could have  been overlooked or \ninterpreted as accidental markings from the ploughing, excavation tools or wire sieves. This \nstudy has emphasised the need to investigate all excavated material carefully, so as not to \noverlook stones with similar incisions that may shed light on the function and context of these \ntools. \n \nAcknowledgements \nFor their support and advice during fieldwork, analysis and publication we thank the \nfollowing: Wathaurung Aboriginal Corporation (Wadawurrung), Bannockburn Holdings P/L, \nAboriginal Victoria, Jodi Turnbull and Katherine Thomas (Ochre Imprints), and Claire St \nGeorge.
