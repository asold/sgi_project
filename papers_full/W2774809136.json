    "abstract": "This work compares the temperature distribution and hot-spot temperatures obtained in a disc-type winding of a power transformer when using as dielectric liquid a mineral oil or natural esters. The comparison is made with a reference case for mass flow rate and temperature in the inlet and uniform losses for the discs. A further comparison is performed by increasing the mass flow rate at the inlet form 0.78 kg/s to 0.9 and 1.0 kg/s, thus nine case studies are considered in this work. These cases have been analyzed via CFD techniques using the software COMSOL Multiphysics® with a 2D-axysymmetrical model using the Conjugate Heat Transfer module. For the analysis, the hotspot factor H is considered as an indicator of the cooling circuit efficiency since the losses are uniform. Results shows that for the base case, the hot-spot temperature obtained for the mineral oil is 9-11°C higher than the obtained with esters whereas for the increased mass flow rate, hot-spot temperature of mineral oil is equal or even lower than the obtained for natural esters. The analysis of the hot-spot factor shows the dependence of the cooling circuit efficiency on the kind of oil and inlet conditions.",
