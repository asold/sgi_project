  "abstract": "Abstract Manufacturing enterprises are facing how to utilise industrial knowledge and continuously accumulating massive unlabelled data to achieve human‐cyber‐physical collaborative and autonomous intelligence. Recently, artificial intelligence‐generative content has achieved great performance in several domains and scenarios. A new concept of industrial generative pre‐trained Transformer (Industrial‐GPT) for intelligent manufacturing systems is introduced to solve various scenario tasks. It refers to pre‐training with industrial datasets, fine‐tuning with industrial scenarios, and reinforcement learning with domain knowledge. To enable Industrial‐GPT to better empower the manufacturing industry, Model as a Service is introduced to cloud computing as a new service mode, which provides a more efficient and flexible service approach by directly invoking the general model of the upper layer and customising it for specific businesses. Then, the operation mechanism of the Industrial‐GPT driven intelligent manufacturing system is described. Finally, the challenges and prospects of applying the Industrial‐GPT in the manufacturing industry are discussed.",
