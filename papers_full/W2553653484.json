Innovations are transmitted from one individual to another and from one\ngeneration to the next through social learning ( Beck et al., 2012 ; Osiurak et al., 2016). In this\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 1 November 2016 | Volume 7 | Article 1625\nfpsyg-07-01625 November 5, 2016 Time: 14:7 # 2\nRemigereau et al. Tool Use Development in Children\nregard, from 2 years of age onward, children start to adequately\nuse tools that they encounter in their environment (i.e.,\nconventional tool use; Lockman, 2000; Vaesen, 2012; Cutting\net al., 2014), and this occurs in particular through their abilities\nto imitate (i.e., adaptation to social uses). Interestingly, the ability\nto solve mechanical problems by using novel tools (e.g., an\nunknown apparatus such as the Hook task, see below) may\ntake place later, at about 8 years of age (Beck et al., 2011).\nThese ﬁndings suggest that real tool use (RTU; e.g., the daily\nuse of a spoon by a toddler to eat) and mechanical problem\nsolving (MPS) skills could be based on cognitive mechanisms of\na diﬀerent nature. This is partly inconsistent with the technical\nreasoning hypothesis mainly developed from the study of left\nbrain-damaged patients, according to which familiar tool use and\nMPS should be supported by common cognitive mechanisms\n(Le Gall, 1998; Osiurak et al., 2010; Osiurak, 2014; Osiurak and\nBadets, 2016). The main goal of the present study is to address this\nissue, by exploring how children aged from 6 to 14 years perform\non RTU and MPS tasks.\nDevelopment of Tool-Making Abilities in\nChildhood\nLockman (2000) proposed that, from a developmental\nperspective, the emergence of tool use before 1 year of age\ndevelops in the absence of optimal representational thinking\n(i.e., symbolic). Several authors have hence assumed that\nhuman tool use is derived from perceptual-motor behavior\nimplemented by children at a very young age: exploration of\nsurfaces/textures/sounds, trial and error strategies, aﬀordance\nperception, grip selection, etc. (van Leeuwen et al., 1994;\nKahrs and Lockman, 2014). Recent studies have, however,\nreported a striking dissociation between these early skills and\nthe subsequent emergence of tool-making abilities in children.\nStudies have shown on multiple occasions that making a\nfunctional tool independently (i.e., without any demonstration,\ncalled ìtool innovation” below) is nearly impossible in healthy\nchildren before the age of 5 years (Beck et al., 2011, 2014; Cutting\net al., 2011) irrespective of their socio-cultural environment\n(Nielsen et al., 2014). The task commonly employed consists\nin recovering a target that is lodged inside a transparent tube\nand that cannot be reached directly by hand (e.g., the Hook\ntask, Unbending task). The making of a new functional tool,\nby modiﬁcation of available items (for example a hook from\na straight metal rod), does not occur spontaneously until late\nin child development: only half of 8-year-old children can do\nso (Beck et al., 2011). Furthermore, this ability is subject to\nan age eﬀect up to 16–17 years of age. While children aged\n4 years are not able to generate a new solution themselves,\nthey are nonetheless readily able to select a suitable pre-made\ntool (for instance a hooked rod versus a straight rod), thus\nindicating adequate analysis of the possible use for such tools.\nIn addition, a prior exploration phase of the tool’s physical\nproperties (e.g., softness, stiﬀness and bendability) does not\nlead to an improvement in the ability to innovate (Beck et al.,\n2011; Gardiner et al., 2012). On the other hand, following a\ndemonstration by the investigator of how to make a functional\ntool (i.e., demonstrated how to bend a rod into a hook), the\nchildren can generally reproduce and use tools from age 3\nonward, thereby revealing that they have suﬃcient dexterity to\nsolve the problem (Chappell et al., 2013). Thus, the dexterity\nis suﬃcient from age 3, and the selection of a functional tool\nseems to occur in children from age 4, for solving a problem\ninvolving tool making (Beck et al., 2014). So, it is not likely that\nthese factors explain a development of tool innovation abilities\nup to 16–17 years of age. In addition, among the children who\ncan achieve the task, it appears that tool innovation is not the\nresult of learning by trial and error, since they are able to make it\nﬁrst-oﬀ or after a single unfruitful attempt (Cutting et al., 2011).\nUnderlying Processes of Tool Innovation\nin Children\nThe previously presented results also revealed diﬀerent\ndevelopmental timetables according to the experimental\nconditions that were considered: tool manufacturing (i.e.,\nmaking a functional tool following a demonstration, from age\n3 onward) versus tool innovation (i.e., spontaneously making\na functional tool, from age 5 onward), suggesting involvement\nof distinct cognitive processes. Limited consideration has been\ngiven, however, to the ìinnovative” nature of the proposed\napparatus due to the single solution expected by the investigator:\nalteration of the available tool with which the children act on the\nunknown entities (i.e., the Hook task can only be solved if the\nchild manufactures a hook). Gardiner et al. (2012) also reported\nbetter abilities among young children (3 years of age) to select\na pre-made functional tool than to use it to solve a mechanical\nproblem (e.g., extraction of a small stuﬀed animal from a\ntransparent box). Unlike the work of Beck and collaborators, in\nthis study no prior transformation of the material was necessary\nto solve the problem. This dissociation is interpreted as a failure\nto adequately relate the selected tool with the apparatus, while\naﬀordances of the tool should be adequately apparent, thereby\nallowing its selection (Gardiner et al., 2012).\nThus, the question of speciﬁcity of the underlying cognitive\nprocesses engaged in these tool innovation tests remains\nunanswered. Does the alteration of the material to innovate\na new tool (as in the Hook task) imply the same cognitive\nabilities as those engaged in relationships between a pre-made\ntool with an apparatus (like in Gardiner’s study)? To answer this\nquestion, it would be relevant to compare the developmental\ncurves characterizing the performances achieved with familiar\ntool use as well as with various types of mechanical apparatus\n(for which some require alteration of the material) by the same\nsample of children.\nContributions of Studies in Adults\nNeuropsychological studies in adults can also shed light on the\nunderstanding of tool innovation in children, notably because\nsimilar experimental devices are commonly employed to assess\ntool use skills in patients with apraxia. Speciﬁcally, several studies\nhave shown in left brain-damaged patients a strong association\nbetween conventional tool use (in a prototypical or unusual\nmanner) and MPS (Goldenberg and Hagmann, 1998; Osiurak\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 2 November 2016 | Volume 7 | Article 1625\nfpsyg-07-01625 November 5, 2016 Time: 14:7 # 3\nRemigereau et al. Tool Use Development in Children\net al., 2009; for review see Osiurak and Badets, 2016; Reynaud\net al., 2016). This has led to the formulation of the hypothesis\nthat technical reasoning is involved in any tool use, whether\nconventional or new/unusual (Le Gall, 1998; Osiurak et al., 2010;\nOsiurak, 2014). This cognitive process refers to the capacity to\nadapt the purpose of an apparatus (e.g., to punch holes) and\nthe underlying technical process (e.g., one item less dense than\nthe other, such as paper sheet/staple). The means and ends are\nabstract and relative principles, because they do not correspond\nwith the physical reality. Rather they are reconstructed de novo\naccording to each form of use. The same material (e.g., wood) can\nprovide distinct technical properties (e.g., resilience, opaqueness,\nﬂammability) according to the intended purpose. The same\ntechnical property (e.g., resilience) can also be presented by\ndiﬀerent materials (e.g., glass, metal, plastic). In this context,\nJarry et al. (2013, p. 2323) assumed that the inability to use tools\ncould reﬂect diﬃculties regarding diﬀerentiating and relating\nrelevant technical means (e.g., dense, permeable, resilient, etc.),\nfor a given outcome (e.g., cutting, etching, etc.). For example,\nìthe lead of a pencil is brittle when applied to paper, but not to\nleather.”\nIt has also been established that knowledge of prototypical\ntool use (semantic memory) is involved in tool use, particularly\nfor adaptation to social uses (e.g., to use scissors ìlike everyone\nelse”; Vaesen, 2012; see also Defeyter and German, 2003 for the\nconcept of ìfunctional ﬁxedness” in children). Yet, while this\nfunctional knowledge (FK) might be useful for conventional tools\nuse (i.e., for which prior use has occurred), it is not necessary for\nintrinsic use and does not suﬃce to account for everyday uses,\nwhich generally require uncommon procedures and the use of\nnon-familiar tools (see also Vaesen, 2012). Baumard et al. (2014)\npointed out that apraxic patients exhibiting impairments of\ntechnical reasoning (e.g., on a sequential MPS test) systematically\nhave pronounced diﬃculties using tools in a conventional way.\nAlthough this conclusion was drawn from adults, it stresses that\nthe cognitive processes involved in solving mechanical problems,\nalso participate in eﬀective use of tools in other contexts.\nOverview of the Present Study\nThe aim of our study was to explore the developmental link\nbetween RTU and MPS skills in healthy children. As suggested,\nchildren could be able to use tools in a conventional way before\ndeveloping considerable MPS skills. This is partly inconsistent\nwith the neuropsychological literature, which mentions a strong\nlink between these two aspects. Three diﬀerent apparatus were\nused for the assessment of MPS skills, because the success\nrates in children for these tasks can diﬀer according to the\ntransparency mechanical relationships and the required degree of\ntool manipulation (Gardiner et al., 2012). So, at a theoretical level,\nit appears fundamental to understand how the diﬀerent forms\nof tool use skills evolve with age. From a clinical perspective,\nthis is also a fundamental question, since impairment of tool\nuse is frequently described in various etiological contexts with\nchildren, such as developmental coordination disorders, cerebral\npalsy, premature birth, autism (O’Hare et al., 1999; Wunsch\net al., 2013; Geldof et al., 2016). Yet the cognitive processes that\nunderlie these impairments are rarely analyzed, due to a lack of\navailable assessment tests in particular. Besides, children were\nalso assessed on a task assessing FK, notably because it has been\nsuggested that this knowledge could be the support for familiar\ntool use (Vaesen, 2012). Our study focused on children aged\nfrom 6 to 14 years, a period in which signiﬁcant age eﬀects on\ntool innovation have been noted in previous research, with the\nemergence of alternative problem-solving strategies from the age\nof 8 years old (Beck et al., 2011). To our knowledge, no study has\ninvestigated normal childhood developmental curves up to the\nage of 14 for these tests.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nParticipants\nFollowing formal approval of the study protocol by the School\nInspection Services, a volunteer cohort of 85 children aged 6 up\nto and including 14 years of age was recruited between January\n2014 and June 2015 from the French school system (from ﬁrst\ngrade to third grade). Once permission was obtained from the\nschool principal and the teachers, all of the children in the\nclass were given the option to participate in the study, provided\nthat the children did not exhibit any of the exclusion criteria:\nsensory impairments (visual or auditory), their proﬁciency with\nthe French language was insuﬃcient to allow them to perform the\ntests, neurodevelopmental or psychiatric pathologies, suspected\nor proven learning disorders, premature birth (prior to 37 weeks\nof gestation), or lack of parental consent. The total sample (mean\nage of 10 years and 3 months, SD: 2 years and 5 months) was\ndivided into six experimental groups according to their ages: 6–\n7 year olds, 8 year olds, 9 year olds, 10 year olds, 11–12 year olds,\nand 13–14 year olds.\nMaterials\nThe assessment of eﬀective tool use (conventional or new) was\nperformed using tests developed for a population of adults with\ncerebral lesions (Jarry et al., 2013; Lesourd et al., 2016), adapted\nin the present study for use with children.\nReal Tool Use (RTU)\nFor this tool use test, the apparatus was comprised of 11 familiar\ntools displayed simultaneously on a vertical board (see Figure 1).\nThe corresponding objects with which the tools could be used\nwere arranged one by one on a table between the child and the\nvertical board.\nEach child was asked to select the tool corresponding with the\nobject presented, and to perform the usual action carried out with\nthe displayed tools and objects. The pair jug/glass was used as a\npractice item (i.e., assistance with the selection and performance\nof the action, if necessary) during which the examiner stressed\nto the children that they needed to fully perform the actions.\nPerformance was video-taped, and one point was awarded if the\nchild exhibited correct use of the object with the appropriate tool\nwithin the time limit (i.e., 1 min for each item). No point was\nawarded if the action was not successfully carried out, according\nto eﬃciency criteria deﬁned beforehand (e.g., the position of the\ndead bolt changed due to the action of the key in the lock, the\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 3 November 2016 | Volume 7 | Article 1625\nfpsyg-07-01625 November 5, 2016 Time: 14:7 # 4\nRemigereau et al.

The maximum possible score was 10 points.\nMechanical Problem-Solving (MPS)\nFor this test, we used three diﬀerent transparent plastic apparatus,\nas Lesourd et al. (2016), albeit with multiple choices. The aim\nof this test was to extract a little red wooden cube or bead\n(i.e., the targets), which were lodged inside each of the boxes.\nFor each apparatus, the Chimney task ( Figure 2B ), the Hook\ntask ( Figure 2C ), and the Sloping task ( Figure 2D ) required\ndiﬀerent actions in order to solve the problem (for more details\nsee Lesourd et al., 2016). To do so, the children were provided\nwith the following materials ( Figure 2A): four 25 cm rods (one\nwas made of wood and the others were either aluminum, copper,\nor tin) and four 7 cm rods (made of the same physical material).\nThe rods were displayed simultaneously in a row on a table to\nthe right of the subjects. The rods hence had various physical\nproperties, e.g., half were long (i.e., rods A, C, E, and G, as shown\nin Figure 2A) and half were short (i.e., rods B, D, F , and H), half\nwere rigid (i.e., rods A, B, C, and D) and half were ﬂexible (i.e.,\nrods E, F , G, and H).\nThe participants could perform this test using one or both\nhands, but the problem could not be solved by directly inserting\na hand into the box, by shaking or other physical handling, by\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 4 November 2016 | Volume 7 | Article 1625\nfpsyg-07-01625 November 5, 2016 Time: 14:7 # 5\nRemigereau et al. Tool Use Development in Children\ntrial and error, or by choosing the rods at random. A sequence\ncomprised of two actions was necessary to solve the problem.\nChildren could use several rods to extract the target (i.e.,\ncombining several rods or alternating diﬀerent rods according to\nthe target’s movement in the box), but only two rods were relevant\nand necessary to solve each problem (see Lesourd et al., 2016\nfor more details). Before the test, a sample test was performed\n(i.e., assistance with performing the action, if necessary) so as to\nensure that the children had identiﬁed the target that needed to\nbe extracted and had adequately understood the aim of the test.\nThe test item consisted of a red wooden bead that needed to be\nextracted from a rectangular and horizontal tube by pushing it\nwith a wooden rod. The only instruction that was given with the\nexample was: ìusing the items at your disposal, show me how to\nrecover the target that is lodged in this box. You may turn the\nbox but do not lift it up.” No feedback was given but children\nwere given neutral prompts if required: ìkeep going, there is a\nsolution.” Performance was video-taped, and the time limit was\n3 min for each item. Two variables were collected for this test:\na qualitative score in terms of success/failure (ìBeck’s rating”)\nand a quantitatively accurate score based on a 4-point scale (see\nTable 1), which was quite similar to the one used by Jarry et al.\n(2013). The maximum score was 3 points for each apparatus.\nFunctional Knowledge (FK)\nFour images with diﬀerent single familiar tools were displayed\nbelow the picture of a tool target (target stimuli were the same as\nthose used in the RTU test). The children were asked to choose\none of the four response options as the best match for the target,\nby pointing to it. The test was preceded by one practice trial (with\na jug) for which feedback regarding the correctness was given.\nThe target and the correct response were functionally equivalent\n(e.g., electrical plug and candle). A score of 1 point was awarded\nif the correct response was given within 20 s, equating with a total\npossible score of 10 points.\nProcedure\nWhen possible, children were tested at their school (in a quiet\nroom), or at home (in an isolated room, without the parents being\npresent). The tests were systematically administered in a speciﬁc\nordered manner for each participant: RTU test ﬁrst, then MPS\ntasks and ﬁnally FK test. This work was included in a broader\nstudy regarding gestural development and tool use in children.\nAn anamnestic questionnaire completed by the parents allowed\nfor conﬁrmation prior to the assessment that the criteria for\ninclusion/exclusion in the study were adhered to. An informed\nconsent form (authorizing the video recordings) was signed by\na legal representative for each child, specifying their freedom to\nwithdraw from the study without any prejudice. The rationale\nand design of the study were detailed in an information pamphlet.\nThe research was conducted in accordance with the University\nguidelines and the ethical standards established by the Helsinki\nDeclaration.\nData Analysis\nPreliminary statistical analyses were conducted with variance\nanalysis (ANOV As, Bonferronipost hoc) and the Chi-Square test\nwas used to examine the equivalence of the age groups in terms\nof gender, the parents’ level of education, and laterality. The\ninspection of MPS, RTU, and FK score distributions revealed that\nnone of them met the conditions for application of parametric\ntests: non-normal distribution of raw scores (Kolmogorov–\nSmirnov one-sample test) and non-homogeneity of variances\n(Levene’s test). Consequently, Kruskal–Wallis ANOV As were\nused to examine the eﬀect of the main factor, namely age (six\nattributes: 6–7 years of age, 8 years of age, 9 years of age,\n10 years of age, 11–12 years of age, 13–14 years of age), on\nMPS performances (three apparatus raw scores), RTU and FK\nresults. Post hoc contrasts were computed with Mann–Whitney\ntests. Friedman ANOV As were used to examine the eﬀect of\nthe apparatus (diﬀerent types of boxes) according to age, with\nWilcoxon signed-rank tests used for within-group comparisons\naccording to age. Spearman rank correlations were used to study\nrelationships between Age, RTU, MPS, and FK on the whole\ngroup ( n =85). However, to better examine the inﬂuence of\nMPS and FK on RTU, we used a generalized linear mixed model\n(GLMM; Burnham et al., 2011), which included MPS and FK\nas ﬁxed factors, and Age as arandom factor. This analysis was\nconducted on the whole group ( n =85). For this analysis,\nRTU scores were converted into binomial scores (10: Success;\n<10: Failure). Akaike’s Information Criterion value corrected\nfor small sample size (AICc) was calculated for the GLMM.\nTABLE 1 | Accuracy-based scoring system used for mechanical problem solving tasks.\n3 points 2 points 1 point 0 point\nThe Chimney task The target had fallen down but was\nnot extracted from the box\nThe child touched the target with a\nrod but without causing it to fall\ndown\nThe Hook task\nThe target was extracted from\nthe box within the time limit,\nindependently of the rod that\nwas used\nThe target was fully taken off the\nbase but it was not extracted from\nthe box\nThe child touched the target with a\nrod but the target was never\ncompletely taken off the base\nThe children touched\nthe box but never the target\nThe Sloping task The target was wedged near the\nopening due to the action of a rod\nbut it was not extracted from the\nbox\nThe child touched the outer part of\nthe bottom of the seesaw with a\nrod introduced into the round\nopening but they did not activate\nthe seesaw\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 5 November 2016 | Volume 7 | Article 1625\nfpsyg-07-01625 November 5, 2016 Time: 14:7 # 6\nRemigereau et al.

The GLMM analyses and the model-\naveraged coeﬃcients were respectively computed using the lme4\nand MuMIn packages in R 3.1.3. For all analyses, the alpha\nthreshold was ﬁxed at p < 0.05. The eﬀect sizes were calculated\nwith Cohen’s d, considering the eﬀect as being large from 0.8 and\nas being medium from 0.5 (Cohen, 1988).\nRESULTS\nSample Characteristics\nSociodemographic characteristics of the sample are presented\nin Table 2 . The age groups were comparable in terms of\nlaterality, according to the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory\n(Oldﬁeld, 1971; with values between +100 for extreme right\nhand preference and −100), F(5,79) =0.502, NS, and sex ratios,\nχ2(6) =6.191, NS, although there was a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in\nterms of the parental level of education,F(5,79) =3.766, p < 0.01.\nBonferroni’spost hoc test showed that the parental education level\nwas signiﬁcantly higher for the 8 year old children than for the 10\nand 11–12 years old children. However, no signiﬁcant correlation\nwas found between the parental education level and scores for\nthe MPS (all r < −0.10, NS), RTU ( r =0.03, NS), or the FK\n(r =−0.10, NS) test. We hence did not take this variable into\naccount for the statistical analyses.\nSimilarly, gender had no eﬀect on the children’s performances\non the MPS, RTU, and FK tests (Mann–Whitney tests, data not\nshown). Thus, data from boys and girls were combined for further\nanalyses.\nAge Effect\nAn eﬀect of age was observed on the RTU test, H(5,85) =14.618,\np =0.01. Post hoc tests were computed and showed that only the\nyoungest children performed worse than children aged 8, 11–12,\nand 13–14 years of age, with large eﬀect sizes ( Cohen’s dbetween\n0.87 and 1.30). Furthermore, the successful scores increased with\nage for the FK, although only a tendency toward signiﬁcance\n(p =0.054) was found between the age groups. These results are\nillustrated by the developmental curves shown in Figure 3.\nWe compared the qualitative performances (ìBeck’s rating”)\nfor the various age groups with the three apparatus for the\nMPS task using Chi-Square tests. There was a trend for the\nperformance on the Chimney task to improve with age (only 59%\nof children succeeded at 6–7 years of age, while 94% succeeded\nat 11–12 years of age), although only two signiﬁcant diﬀerences\nemerged (see Figure 4 ): more of the 11–12 year-old children\nsucceed than the 6–7 and the 8 year olds ( χ2 =5.470, p =0.02;\nχ2 =5.110, p =0.02, respectively). A greater progression was\nfound with the Hook task: the 11–12 and the 13–14 year-old\nchildren were better than the younger 6–7, 8, and 10 year-old (all\nps < 0.03). Likewise, on the Sloping task, the 10–14 year olds were\nbetter than the 6–7 and 9 year olds (all ps < 0.03). The number of\nchildren who succeeded at this task was also signiﬁcantly higher\namong the 13–14 year-old relative to the group of 8 year olds\n(χ2 =6.240, p =0.01).\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 6 November 2016 | Volume 7 | Article 1625\nfpsyg-07-01625 November 5, 2016 Time: 14:7 # 7\nRemigereau et al.

In addition, a signiﬁcant\ncorrelation was also seen between RTU and MPS ( r =0.21;\np =0.049). Nonetheless, no signiﬁcant correlation was found\nbetween scores for RTU and FK, or between MPS and\nFK.\nAs mentioned, the inﬂuence of the predictors MPS and FK\non RTU was tested using a generalized linear mixed model\n(GLMM) with Age as a random factor. There were three\ntop candidate models with 1i < 2 (see Table 5 ), the best\none being the MPS only model. We also computed model-\naveraged estimators based on AICc. The only statistically\nsigniﬁcant predictor of RTU is MPS (Importance weight: 0.65;\nEstimate ±Standard Error: 0.27 ±0.08). This variable was\nsigniﬁcant at the 95% conﬁdence level (the interval did not\ncontain the 0 value).\nApparatus Effect on Mechanical Problem\nSolving\nFriedman ANOV As revealed an eﬀect of the apparatus on the\nMPS tasks at 6–7 years of age (χ2 =16.511, p < 0.001), 9 years of\nage (χ2 =10.571, p < 0.01), 11–12 years of age ( χ2 =10.750,\np < 0.01) and 13–14 years of age ( χ2 =7.429, p < 0.05).\nA signiﬁcant trend was only seen at 8 years of age ( χ2 =5.892,\np =0.05), and there were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the\nthree apparatus at 10 years of age (χ2 =2.722, p =NS).\nPost hoc intra-group age comparisons showed that the\nSloping task was accomplished signiﬁcantly worse than the two\napparatus of the MPS test by 6–7-year-old than 11–12-year-\nold ( p-values < 0.05). For the oldest children (13–14 years\nof age), the scores for the Sloping task were not signiﬁcantly\ndiﬀerent from the other apparatus ( p =0.07). By contrast,\nthe successful performances with the other two apparatus\n(Chimney task and Hook task) were equivalent for the six age\ngroups.\nDISCUSSION\nThe aim of the present study was to explore the typical\ndevelopment of RTU and its relationship with MPS in a sample\nof school-age children. The novelty of this work lies in the use\nof a new experimental test to evaluate RTU in everyday-life,\nassociated in the use of three diﬀerent MPS tasks (Chimney,\nHook, and Sloping tasks). In addition, FK was also assessed, with\nstrictly matched items (the same tools were used in the two tasks).\nThe main ﬁnding is a signiﬁcant developmental progression\nof scores in children between 6 and 14 years on the RTU test and\non the MPS tasks with two apparatus, namely the Hook task and\nthe Sloping task. However, we found only a weak improvement\nwith age for the FK test. Interestingly, MPS appears to be a better\npredictor of RTU task than FK. Finally, we found no association\nbetween the RTU test and FK.\nUnderlying Cognitive Processes Involved\nin the Development of Real Tool Use\nWe found a signiﬁcant link between the age of children and the\nthree types of tests proposed in this study: RTU, MPS, and FK.\nThe analysis of relationships between these diﬀerent forms of tool\nuse abilities revealed in healthy children an interesting and novel\ninvolvement of MPS skills in conventional tool use development.\nMore particularly, GLMM analyses revealed that MPS was a good\npredictor of RTU even when age is included as a random factor.\nIn broad terms, a link between MPS and RTU exists between\n6 and 14 years of age. This link supports the hypothesis that\nthe analysis of technical apparatus properties contributes to the\ndevelopment of RTU, independently of age and FK. Along these\nlines, Gergely and Csibra (2003; and more recently Hernik and\nCsibra, 2015) developed the notion of a teleogical interpretation\nsystem (ìteleological stance”) that allows children from age one\nonward to observe actions and to conjure inferences linking these\nactions in terms of means and ends as a function of situational\nconstraints. In addition, Hernik and Csibra (2009) point out that\nan object is always made for something, even if not used. The\nbehavior of even very young children shows this search for an\nobject-function association, providing knowledge on the use and\nfunction of objects and allowing the child to learn by observing\nothers.\nRegarding the FK test, no developmental eﬀect was found,\nand the GLMM analysis revealed that FK does not predict RTU.\nOverall, these results indicate that children possess the majority\nof FK on these tools from 6 years of age onward. In our study,\nthis knowledge does not contribute to the typical development\nof the abilities for eﬀective use of these same tools between 6\nand 14 years of age. This supports the hypothesis that FK is not\nnecessary for and evolves in parallel to RTU in everyday life.\nThe lack of assoiation between the RTU and FK tests puts the\nnature of the knowledge examined in question. As a matter of\nfact, those semantic knowledges allow the selection of the tool\nthat is typically used with a given object. On the other hand, it\nis unlikely that FK allows for eﬀective and eﬃcient use of the\ntool in question. More particularly, FK can be used to select a\nbottle opener as the tool usually used to remove the cap from a\nglass bottle. Nonetheless, this knowledge does not provide the\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 8 November 2016 | Volume 7 | Article 1625\nfpsyg-07-01625 November 5, 2016 Time: 14:7 # 9\nRemigereau et al. Tool Use Development in Children\ninformation required to use the tool eﬃciently (i.e., which part\nof the tool must be applied to the bottle, what action must\nbe undertaken: lifting, rubbing, turning, etc.). In other words,\nsemantic FK might not be critical for eﬀective use but could\nfacilitate the process to a certain extent (see Hodges et al., 2000;\nBozeat et al., 2002). Speciﬁc knowledge regarding ìuse” could be\nreﬂected in the ìmechanical” properties of the tools (i.e., the way\nof learning about the tools and the relationship with their abstract\nphysical properties like rigidity, ﬂexibility, etc.).\nAge Effect on Mechanical Problem\nSolving Depends on the Type of\nExperimental Apparatus\nOur results reveal an eﬀect of age on the performance of the\nMPS task, particularly for two out of the three apparatus (Sloping\nand Chimney apparatus) irrespective of the rating method used\n(i.e., Beck’s rating system or the accuracy-based scoring system\ncreated for our study) in agreement with previous study (Beck\net al., 2011; Cutting et al., 2011). For the Hook task, our ﬁndings\nshow a ceiling eﬀect from 11 years of age onward instead of\n16–17 years of age, which could indicate earlier maturity of the\nunderlying processes than in the data of Beck et al. (2011). Several\nmethodological variations could explain these diﬀerences (e.g.,\nthe time limit, the number of tools). The progression appeared\nmore linear for the Sloping task, with medium to large eﬀect\nsizes. Performance appeared equivalent between children of 6–\n7 years of age and 9 years of age (score of 1.1 points out of 3),\nand an extended improvement of the scores up to 14 years of\nage was seen (2.3 points, on average, out of 3). By contrast, no\nsigniﬁcant developmental eﬀect is observed on the Chimney task\nfor the age groups between 6 and 14 years of age. So, the type\nof experimental apparatus modiﬁes age eﬀects on MPS: mature\nperformance at 6 years of age for the Chimney task, at 11 years\nof age for the Hook task, or under development at 14 years of\nage for the Sloping task. Moreover, the details of the accuracy-\nbased scoring system on the Hook task show that from 6 years\nof age, children get a mean score of 2.1 points out of 3. These\nresults indicate that those who failed to extract the target from the\nbox in the allocated time (47% of the children) were nonetheless\nable to raise the target oﬀ the bottom of the tube. So the analysis\nof the technical properties of the apparatus already seems to\nbe taking place at the cognitive level. For instance, use of a\nsuﬃciently long tool allows contact and action on the target at\nthe bottom of the box (see Figures 2A,C). The hypothesis of an\nearly engagement of technical reasoning from age of 6 onward\nthat allows mechanical problems to be solved, nevertheless raises\nthe issue of the cognitive processes explaining the improvement\nof scores after this age in the MPS tasks.\nThe two apparatus showing age eﬀects in our sample revealed\ndiﬀerential growth curves. In fact, the intra-group analyses\nrevealed a signiﬁcant eﬀect of the type of apparatus between 6\nand 14 years of age. The Sloping task is the only apparatus with\nconsiderably less success than the other two up to 11–12 years\nof age, after which the gap tended to narrow with the older\nchildren (13–14 years of age). A partial variation of the scores\nfor solving mechanical problems was hence seen, depending on\nthe diﬀerent relationships of means-end reciprocity engaged as\na function of age: directly reach and move the target for the\nChimney task, create a new tool for the Hook task, and carefully\nexplore the apparatus to ﬁnd the seesaw for the Sloping task.\nSo this partial eﬀect of apparatus that do not share the same\ntechnical principles suggests that technical analysis is done in the\nhere and now. This is consistent with the results of Beck et al.\n(2014), who reported no transfer of knowledge for the Hook\ntask with diﬀerent means and materials. Another explanation\ncould be that there is an eﬀect of complexity between the\ndiﬀerent mechanical problems used, since performance in the\nSloping task is clearly inferior to that obtained in the other\napparatus, whatever the age group. Such an eﬀect of complexity\nhas already been seen among healthy children of pre-school age\nin the setting of MPS. Thus, Gardiner et al. (2012) revealed a\nsigniﬁcant diﬀerence between the success rates with three types of\nmechanical problems according to the transparency mechanical\nrelationships between objects present in the apparatus and the\ndegree of tool manipulation required to extract the target from\nthe box. Unlike other apparatus, the Sloping task in our study\nrequires ﬁnding the mobile compartment enclosed within the\nbox, so the aﬀordances of this task were partially hidden. The\nlow scores observed in the Sloping task probably reﬂect the\nchildren’s diﬃculty to readily separate the observable properties\nof the material so as to discover access to the seesaw located at\nthe back of the box (see Figure 2D). So, this particular apparatus\ncould be more subject than the others to the ability to block\nnon-pertinent strategies; namely, to switch and approach the\nproblem from another point of view, and to plan the successive\nstages required to solve the problem; or, in other words, through\nuse of executive functioning. Given that cognitive processes are\nalso in full development but still relatively immature at the ages\ncovered in our study (Roy, 2015), their contribution could prove\nto be eﬀective only in older children. This could potentially\nexplain the narrowing of the signiﬁcant gap between the scores\nfor the Sloping task and the two other mechanical problems with\nincreasing age.\nFurther research is needed to highlight the nature of the\nstrategies used by children to solve the MPS task. A ﬁrst step\nin this direction was through our study with an accuracy-based\nscoring system, but qualitative analyses based on thetool selection\n(number of relevant and irrelevant tools grasped; see Lesourd\net al., 2016) versus their application are also required. Such\nmeasurements would allow for examination of the capacity of\nchildren to recognize the technical means suitable for performing\nthe task (rigid, ﬂexible, suﬃciently long, etc.) and not only the\nadequate form of a preformed tool. The time spent engaged in\nvarious actions could also be studied (no handling, tool handling,\nbox handling, tool-box manipulation; see Osiurak et al., 2013)\nso as to distinguish behaviors exploring the boxes or the tools\nas separate from genuine attempts at relating to the purpose\nof the apparatus (extracting the target) through the technical\napplication of the tools. Other studies are also required to explore\npossible links between MPS and executive functioning in healthy\nchildren. While previous works have already raised this issue\n(Chappell et al., 2013), to our knowledge, no prior study has\nemployed executive tests to address this hypothesis.\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 9 November 2016 | Volume 7 | Article 1625\nfpsyg-07-01625 November 5, 2016 Time: 14:7 # 10\nRemigereau et al. Tool Use Development in Children\nCONCLUSION\nTo conclude, this study is original in examining the typical\ndevelopment of RTU and its relationships with MPS. We found\nan eﬀect of age between 6 and 14 years on the RTU test and\non the MPS tasks with only two apparatus. Our ﬁndings also\nprovide evidence for the existence of relationships between the\nreal use of tools and MPS, and the joint development of these\nskills in children. On the other hand, no developmental eﬀect\nwas found for FK test in relation to these tools. Thus, the absence\nof a relationship with conventional tool use suggests that RTU\nand FK could evolve in parallel without a strong connection.\nFurthermore, our results suggest that the underlying processes\nof technical reasoning (specifying the relationships between\nvarious environmental components) are partially operative from\nthe age of 6 onward, even though the outcome of their use\nvaries according to the context in which they are applied.\nLastly, while the theoretical framework used in this study is\nbased on work developed using adults, it oﬀers interesting\nperspectives in regard to understanding the development of\nabilities of tool use in various contexts in children. The\nrelationships between RTU and MPS remain to be explored in\nthe context of pediatric pathologies, thus potentially allowing\nthe underlying cognitive processes to be dissociated. Studies\nof children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD)\nwould be particularly relevant, as they experience diﬃculties with\nthe use of tools in everyday life.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nCR conceived and designed the study, oversaw the data collected,\nanalyzed and discussed the data, contributed to drafting the\nmanuscript, and reviewed and approved the ﬁnal version and its\nsubmission.
