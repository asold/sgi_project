    "abstract": "This paper deals with parameter estimation of single-phase transformer equivalent circuit by using Chaotic Optimization Approach (COA). Unknown transformer equivalent circuit parameters need to be accurately estimated for the best possible matching between the measured and the estimated transformer output characteristics (for example, output power—load resistance characteristic). Unlike literature approaches which apply different estimation techniques and are based either on the nameplate data or the load data obtained from experiments, in this paper the use of COA is evaluated on both types of input data. For two single-phase transformers, different with respect to machine power and voltage levels, the COA-based parameter estimation is compared to various literature techniques as well as to classical method based on open-circuit and short-circuit tests. The results show that COA outperforms other approaches in terms of average error between the measured and the estimated values of the primary current, secondary current and secondary voltage at full load, or between the measured and the estimated output characteristics. The effectiveness of COA is additionally confirmed through its application on laboratory 2kVA, 220 V/110 V, 50 Hz single-phase transformer.",
