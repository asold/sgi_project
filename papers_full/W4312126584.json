    "abstract": "The major cause of death worldwide is due to cardiovascular disorders (CVDs). For a proper diagnosis of CVD disease, an inexpensive solution based on phonocardiogram (PCG) signals is proposed. (1) Background: Currently, a few deep learning (DL)-based CVD systems have been developed to recognize different stages of CVD. However, the accuracy of these systems is not up-to-the-mark, and the methods require high computational power and huge training datasets. (2) Methods: To address these issues, we developed a novel attention-based technique (CVT-Trans) on a convolutional vision transformer to recognize and categorize PCG signals into five classes. The continuous wavelet transform-based spectrogram (CWTS) strategy was used to extract representative features from PCG data. Following that, a new CVT-Trans architecture was created to categorize the CWTS signals into five groups. (3) Results: The dataset derived from our investigation indicated that the CVT-Trans system had an overall average accuracy ACC of 100%, SE of 99.00%, SP of 99.5%, and F1-score of 98%, based on 10-fold cross validation. (4) Conclusions: The CVD-Trans technique outperformed many state-of-the-art methods. The robustness of the constructed model was confirmed by 10-fold cross-validation. Cardiologists can use this CVT-Trans system to help patients with the diagnosis of heart valve problems.",
