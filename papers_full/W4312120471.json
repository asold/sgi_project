  "full_text": "HOW GENERATIVE LANGUAGE MODELS CAN \nENHANCE INTERACTIVE LEARNING WITH SOCIAL \nROBOTS \nStefan Sonderegger \nInstitute for Educational Management and Technologies \nUniversity of St.Gallen, 9000 St.Gallen, Switzerland \nABSTRACT \nThe use of social robots in education  is a growing area of research and the potential future applications are various. \nHowever, t he conversational models behind current social robots and chatbot system s often rely on rule -based and  \nretrieval-based methods. This limits the social robot to predefined responses and topics, thus hindering it from fluent \ncommunication and interaction. Generative language models such as GPT-3 could be beneficial in this context, e.g. for an \nimproved conversation and open -ended question ans wering. This article presents an approach to utilizing generative \nlanguage models to enhance interactive learning with educational social robots. The proposed model combines the \ntechnological possibilities of generative language models with the educational tasks of a social robot in the role of a tutor \nand learning partner. The implementation of the model in practice is illustrated by means of a use case consisting of different \nlearning scenarios. The social robot generates explanations, questions, corrections, and answers based on the pre-trained \nGPT-3 model. By exploring the potential of generative language models for interactive learning with social robots on \ndifferent levels of abstraction, the paper also aims to contribute to an understanding of the future relevance and possibilities \nthat generative language models bring into education and educational technologies in general.  \nKEYWORDS \nSocial Robots in Education, Human-Robot-Interaction, Interactive Learning, Generative Language Models, GPT-3 \n1. INTRODUCTION \nSocial robots are specialized in social interactions with humans and have the potential to support our learning \nand teaching (Belpaeme et al. 2018). In roles such as tutor, teaching assistant, and peer learner, social robots \nmight be used not only as a  practical tool to learn about STEM subjects but also as a teaching and learning \ntool, e.g. for language learning, in special education, in diverse areas and on the basis of various learning \ncontent (Belpaeme & Tanaka 2021) . The demand for personal tutorial support  for learners underlines the \npotential of scalable, individualizable, and interactive social robots for future learning and teaching support. In \naddition to these advantages, which apply  to chatbots or conversational systems in general (cf. Pérez, \nDaradoumis & Puig 2020), research groups around social robots in education highlight and demonstrat e the \nadvantage of physical presence over screen -based or computer-based technologies. The physical nature and \nsocial presence allow real -world interactions and are shown to enhance learning outcomes and motivation \n(Belpaeme & Tanaka 2021).  \nHowever, for more complex learning and teaching scenarios, social robots currently often are unable to \nmeet the high expectations and  technical requirements that are imposed  on them (e.g., with regard to \npersonalized learning). Researchers emphasize that current models of social robots, such as Pepper and NAO, \nquickly reach their limits in the inherently complex educational interactions (Belpaeme et al. 2018). Schulze \net al. (2021) point out that learning can only be reduced to a pre -programmed interaction to a limited extent \nand in individual cases. The studies of social robots in the field of education that they have reviewed therefore \nhave a strong experimental character, which means that previous results can only be transferred to educational \npractice to a limited extent. Accordingly, besides an attributed versatile future potential, researchers see social \nrobots in the near future primarily in supporting and complementary roles (Schulze et al. 2021). Our previous \nresearch in this area also shows a differentiated picture. A survey of students on the acceptance of social robots \n19th International Conference on Cognition and Exploratory Learning in Digital Age (CELDA 2022)\n89\nfor learning purposes in higher education has shown that the intention to use them can be predicted and thus \nincreased by determinants (factors) such as improved perceived adaptiveness or social presence of the robot \n(Guggemos, Seufert & Sonderegger 2020) . And in a practice-oriented interview study, today's widely used \nmodels of social robots are  perceived to be not mature enough in terms o f a natural interactive conversation \nwhen it comes to their use in the educational context (Sonderegger, Guggemos & Seufert 2022). \nIn order to achieve the quality of learning and scenarios desirable from an educational perspective, adaptive \nand interactive elements are essential parts of robot-assisted or, more generally, technology-enhanced learning. \nAccording to the ICAP framework, interactive (dialoguing) learning as a form of engagement represents the \nhighest quality level of learning (e.g., learning with deeper understanding) , after passive (receiving), active \n(manipulating), and constructive (generating) learning (Chi & Wylie 2014). The authors emphasize, that the \nICAP framework can be used as a guide for instructional design and compute r-based learning environments \n(Chi & Wylie 2014) . Scalable learning in discourse (interactive mode of engageme nt) is a central future \npotential of social robots  and conversational technologies in education, not only but even more so at higher \nlevels of education due to its complexity. At the same time, the limited social -interactive capabilities are still \nthe weak points of today's systems. However, technological advances in natural language processing (NLP) \nopen up untapped potential. According to Foster (2019), most developers of social robots tend to employ simple \nrule- or template -based methods for language generation and make no use of the full possibilities of  \nstate-of-the-art natural language generation technologies due to the fact that there are numerous other technical \nchallenges in the development of social robots. But since face-to-face dialogue is the most basic, richest, and \nmost flexible form of human communication, it is essential, especially for its use in education, that linguistic \nconversation is fluid and flexible as an important part of the interaction (Foster 2019).  \nThe aim of this paper is to address this challenge by exploring the potential of modern generative language \nmodels for interactive learning with social robots based on the following research question:  \nHow can interactive learning with social robots for educational purposes be enhanced based on  \nstate-of-the-art generative language models? \nBased on this research goal we present an approach to evolve social robots towards interactive learning by \nutilizing generative language models.  By integrating the state -of-the-art generative learning model GPT -3 \n(Generative pre-trained transformer) by OpenAI (Brown et al. 2020) over a web API, we illustrate a practical \nuse case of an interactive robot tutor. Based on GPT-3, the robot is more flexible and adaptive in terms of his \nconversation skills and can for example answer open-ended questions (Dale 2021). AI models like GPT-3 are \npre-trained based on huge amounts of data and ca n be fine-tuned for a wide range of tasks (e.g., question \nanswering, information extraction, sentiment analysis), thus they are also referred to as pre-trained models or \nfoundation models (cf. Bommasani et al. 2021). Given the significant technological advances, the simplicity \nof fine-tuning for users based on limited data, and the resulting increased scalability, such foundation models \nenable new and interesting applications, especially in education (Bommasani et al. 2021).  \nWith the proposed approach, this paper contributes to application-oriented research in this area by providing \nan understanding of the possibilities and relevance of generative language models in the field of educational \ntechnologies. Illustrating the approach in the context of the presented use case can further help researchers and \npractitioners gain insight into the current  and future opportunities that generative language models offer for \nrobot-supported education. \n2. INTERACTIVE ROBOT TUTOR MODEL \nBased on the theoretical foundation discussed in the introduction we propose an interactive robot tutor model \n(Figure 1). The model follows a high-level learner-centered and task-oriented view and highlights the relevance \nof the underlying tech nologies. On the basis of the activities of a robot tutor and the learner’s mode of \nengagement according to the ICAP framework (Chi & Wylie 2014) on the horizontal axis, the presented model \nlays out the possibilities of generative language models by structuring on the vertical axis along the maturity \nof the underlying chatbot technology or method (Cahn 2017; Adamopoulou & Moussiades 2020).  \n \nISBN: 978-989-8704-43-6  © 2022\n90\n \nFigure 1. Interactive robot tutor model \nThe robot in the role of a tutor and the social context of a one-to-one interaction can approach a topic  or \nlearning subject from different directions. He can explain a topic  based on a request or a question (1) , ask \nquestions to the learner (2), assess answers from the learner and provide feedback (3) and he can try to discuss \na topic interactively with the learner (4). These different types of robot activities and the corresponding modes \nof learner engagement  are independent of the type of knowledge being taught and may include factual, \nprocedural, conceptual, or metacognitive knowledge (cf. Anderson & Krathwohl 2001). But not all methods \nof language generation or dialoguing offer the same possibilities in terms of topic choice, type, and adaptivity \nof the interaction elements. \n(1) Passive learning scenario in which the robot explains: rule -based and retrieval -based explanations \nallow predefined answers and explanations and thus fewer errors (e.g., teacher -inserted answer), \nwhereas generative -based explanations allow domain -open explanations at different lev els of \ndifficulty. \n(2) Active learning scenario in which the robot asks closed questions answered by the learner: questions \ncan be retrieved from external services (e.g., from an LMS or open access question databases) offering \npredefined questions and answer o ptions or they can be generated based on trained or fine -tuned \ngenerative language models offering again domain-open and freely adaptive questions.  \n(3) Constructive learning scenario in which the learner answers or even rationalizes an open -ended \nquestion and receives an adaptive, individualized, corrective feedback from the robot based on the \ngenerative language model (not possible in this form with rule -based or retrieval -based methods of \nlanguage generation).  \n(4) Interactive learning scenario in which the learner freely interacts with the robot in dialogue, whereas \nthe robot answers are generated by the generative language model based on the context of the previous \ndialogue (not possible in this form with rule-based or retrieval-based methods of language generation). \nThe fields in light grey are combinations that are only possible in a very limited form and basically do not \nfulfill the pedagogically intended tasks. The fields highlighted in blue thus indicate the building blocks that \ncomplement each other in an integrative application and should be optimally combined to enable the learner to \nlearn interactively with the robot tutor in the future. Even if some elements are still technically immature, this \ncombination promises to cover the different engagement levels of learners on the one hand and the tasks of a \ntutor robot on the other. In order to fulfill its task according to the curriculum, the robot tutor ideally obtains \nits content and knowledge base from the learning management system (LMS) and uses it to fine -tune the \ngenerative language model. As a result, the generative language model is oriented to the predefined learning \ncontent from the LMS in terms of both content and level of difficulty but can respond very freely and adaptively \nto the learner in the interaction with the robot.  \nRobot explains\n(explain a topic)\nPassive learning\n(learner is listening)\nRobot asks\n(ask questions)\nActive learning\n(selecting/answering)\nRobot assesses\n(assess/correct answers)\nConstructive learning\n(justifying/reflecting)\nRobot interacts\n(simulate conversations)\nInteractive learning\n(dialoguing)\nRule-based\n(e.g., Template)\n• Closed domain \n• Stored explanation\n(e.g., predefined topics \nand answers in template)\n• Closed domain\n• Closed questions\n(e.g., single or multiple \nchoice questions)\n• Closed domain\n• Closed answers\n(e.g., single or multiple \nchoice correction)\n• Closed domain\n• Linear conversation\n(e.g., simple predefined \nrule-based conversation)\nRetrieval-based\n(e.g., LMS)\n• Closed domain\n• Available explanation\n(e.g., topics available in \ndatabases or via external \nservices)\n• Closed domain\n• Available questions\n(e.g., questions available \nin databases or via \nexternal services)\n• Closed domain\n• Closed answers\n(e.g., multiple choice or \nkeyword detection)\n• Closed domain\n• Linear conversation\n(e.g., simple directed \nconversation with \npredefined responses)\nGenerative\n(e.g., GPT-3)\n• Open domain\n• Adaptive explanation\n(e.g., ‘all’ topics can be \nexplained on different \nlevels of sophistication)\n• Open domain\n• Open-ended questions\n(e.g., different sorts of \nquestions covering ‘all’ \ntopics on different levels)\n• Open domain\n• Open-ended answers\n(e.g., assess open \nanswers by the learner \nwith adaptive feedback)\n• Open domain\n• Free conversation\n(e.g., ‘free’ conversation \nwith generation of new \nresponses) \nQuality of learning by mode of engagement \nMaturity of technology\n19th International Conference on Cognition and Exploratory Learning in Digital Age (CELDA 2022)\n91\n3. USE CASE OF AN IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MODEL \nIn the following section, the presented interactive robot tutoring model is illustrated by a practical use case of \na social robot used in higher education. By providing insight into implemented elements and learning scenarios \nused in workshops on AI and the future of learning , the theoretical ideas are made tangible through concrete \nexamples. In addition to these current applications, their technical implementation and limitations and future \nideas will also be discussed.  The use case differentiates four main learning scenarios and corresponding \ntechnical implementations which are however closely related and integrated within an overall tutorial module. \n \n \nFigure 2. Use Case – Interactive Robot Tutor: Explanation Module \nAs illustrated in Figure 2, the configuration of possible topics, levels of difficulty, and learner activities is \ncontrolled in the template via a robot management platform and configured in a rule-based manner. Topics can \nbe predefined in the robot management platform, retrieved based on topics in the learning management system \n(LMS) or a free selection of topics can be provided to the learner. In a free conversation mode where the learner \nasks a question , the administrator of the robot configures the dialogue management towards the use of  \nrule-based, retrieval-based, or generative explanation generation based on the form of the question or the \navailability of the given topic (e.g., if an answer can’t be answered by an internal template -based rule or \nretrieved via Wikipedia API, the explanation will be generated by the GPT-3 generative language model).  \n \nRobot explains\n(explain a topic)\nPassive learning\n(learner is listening)\nRobot asks\n(ask questions)\nActive learning\n(selecting/answering)\nRobot assesses\n(assess/correct answers)\nConstructive learning\n(justifying/reflecting)\nRobot interacts\n(simulate conversations)\nInteractive learning\n(dialoguing)\nRule-based\n(e.g., Template)\nTemplate-based introduction to the tutorial module and topic\nExample:\nLearner can choose between  given topics (e.g. AI, robotics, big data) and a level of difficulty (e.g., beginner, advanced, \npro) and is provided with a short introduction into the topic based on illustrations on the robot’s tablet.\nTechnical implementation: \nThe content is designed template-based and configured in a robot management platform. Via the dialog management \n(e.g., in qiChat) one can decide what sorts of questions are answered retrieval-based (e.g., “what is …”) or based on \nthe generative module (e.g., “why …”, “where …”, “how …”).\nRetrieval-based\n(e.g., LMS)\nRobot explains retrieved knowledge from Wikipedia (or if available from LMS)\nExample dialogue: \nLearner Question: “What is a social robot?”\nRobot answer: “A social robot is an autonomous robot that interacts and communicates with humans by following \nsocial behaviours and rules attached to its role”(Wikipedia). Robot tablet output: Picture of a social robot\nTechnical implementation: \nA self developed Python module retrieves a summary for any given 'term' via the Wikipedia web API and outputs it via \nthe robot's speech engine after parsing. \nGenerative\n(e.g., GPT-3)\nRobot explains any given topic/question based on GPT-3 text generation\nExample dialogue: \nLearner question: “Where could I use a social robot?”\nRobot answer: “There are many potential applications for social robots. They could be used in healthcare settings to \nprovide companionship to patients, in educational settings to help children learn, or in businesses as customer service \nrepresentatives.”\nTechnical implementation: \nA self developed Python module sends a prompt containing any question or topic to be explained via web API to a fine-\ntuned GPT-3 model (fine-tuned to give short robot explanations on different levels) and returns the output of the model \nvia the robot's speech engine. \nISBN: 978-989-8704-43-6  © 2022\n92\n \nFigure 3.

Sensors are responsible for the external perception of robots. An actuator is \nthe counterpart to a sensor and refers to the moving components of a robot.”\nTechnical implementation: \nA Python module retrieves multiple-choice questions including answers via the LMS API and outputs it via the robot's \nspeech engine and presents it on the robot’s tablet. \nGenerative\n(e.g., GPT-3)\nRobot asks questions to any given topic based on GPT-3 text generation\nExample dialogue: \nTopic to freely chosen by learner: “Social robots”\nRobot question (GPT-3 generated): “What are social robots primarily used for?”\nOptional robot answer options (GPT-3 generated): A: “To interact with humans” or B: “to perform a task” \nLearner answer: “A” → Robot Feedback: “Correct.”\nTechnical implementation: \nA self developed Python module sends a prompt containing any chosen topic via web API to a fine-tuned GPT-3 model \n(fine-tuned to generate short robot questions with two or multiple answer options) and returns the output of the model \nvia the robot's speech engine. \nRobot explains\n(explain a topic)\nPassive learning\n(learner is listening)\nRobot asks\n(ask questions)\nActive learning\n(selecting/answering)\nRobot assesses\n(assess/correct answers)\nConstructive learning\n(justifying/reflecting)\nRobot interacts\n(simulate conversations)\nInteractive learning\n(dialoguing)\nGenerative\n(e.g., GPT-3)\nRobot assesses open answers/rationales and provides feedback based on fine-tuned GPT-3 model \nExample dialogue: \nTopic freely chosen by learner: “Social robots”\nOpen robot question (GPT-3 generated or retrieved via LMS): “What are social robots primarily used for?”\nLearner answer: “Primarily for fun.”\nRobot feedback (individualized): “Social robots have many purposes. They can be used for fun, but they are also used \nin healthcare, education, and research.” \nTechnical implementation: \nA self developed Python module sends a prompt containing the robots question and the corresponding learner answer \nto a fine-tuned GPT-3 model and returns the output of the model via the robot's speech engine. The model is fine-tuned \nto assess answers to open-ended questions based on a limited number of examples and aims to provide a corrective, \nconstructive, motivational, and individualized feedback, that builds on the learner's response as in the example above. \nThis implementation is limited in part by the fact that the robot’s ability to understand and process human speech input \nis error-sensitive at the current state of the technology. Given a not too complex language, the understanding of the \nGPT-3 model is already at a high level in most contexts, with task-oriented fine-tuning playing an important role. \n19th International Conference on Cognition and Exploratory Learning in Digital Age (CELDA 2022)\n93\n \nFigure 5. Use Case – Interactive Robot Tutor: Dialogue Module \nThe demonstrated use case within Figures 2, 3, 4, and 5 gives a detailed insight into the four modules from \na user perspective based on the dialogue and from a technical implementation side. To reunite the picture of \nthe four separate modules, it has to be mentioned that these technically separated tasks are separately accessible \nvia the free conversation mode of the robot, but mainly used integrated into one tutor learning module where \nthe learner chooses between different learning activities after choosing a learning topic. The interaction can \nthus be initiated by the learner as well as by the robot. In the free conversation mode of the robot, it can be \nprompted to act via questions. If you ask the robot, for example, whether it can ask you a question, the robot \nwill ask you back on which topic it should ask a  question. The choice of topics can be restricted if necessary \nand defined via an LMS but is in practice used as free as possible in the sense of an open-domain idea. Based \non the topic and optionally a selected difficulty level, a method of a self-developed module is executed on the \nrobot by the robot dialogue management , which in turn sends a request to  the GPT-3 model via web API \ncontaining the topic and a  template with training examples (to fine -tune the language model) and receives a \nmodel generated question in return. The same procedure applies to the different modules (explanation module \nfigure 2, quiz module in figure 3, assessment module in figure 4 , and the dialogue module in figure 5) based \non different task configurations and thus different context and task-oriented fine-tunings and training examples. \nThe primary limitation in this case and generally in the use case is the limited speech recognition capabilities \nof the robot model Pepper. The robot cannot speak and listen simultaneously and is limited in the ability to \ndetect the end of a speech input to process (e.g., the robot's listening is often interrupted in the middle of user \ninput, as the user tends to take short pauses in speaking). The robot’s internal dialog system works well based \non the local rule -based dialogues and allows to send parts of the speech input to a remote automated speech \nrecognition (ASR) engine which does not always perform stably. A few words or  a compactly formulated \nsentence can usually be pro cessed, provided the learner is somewhat accustomed to talking to the robot and \nthere is no strong background noise. Given these technical limitations , the current role of the robot is still \nstrongly that of a research and educational tool, helping to understand technological development and to think \nabout its future use in areas such as education. However, in the longer term and based on more advanced robot \nor educational technology, the role of an AI-based educational tutor, learning partner, or assistant for interactive \nlearning may become more and more realistic.  \nRobot explains\n(explain a topic)\nPassive learning\n(learner is listening)\nRobot asks\n(ask questions)\nActive learning\n(selecting/answering)\nRobot assesses\n(assess/correct answers)\nConstructive learning\n(justifying/reflecting)\nRobot interacts\n(simulate conversations)\nInteractive learning\n(dialoguing)\nRule-based Not applicable\nRetrieval-based Not applicable\nGenerative\n(e.g., GPT-3)\nRobot freely interacts with the learner based on GPT-3 text generation\nExample dialogue: \nDialogue initiated by learner: “Hello”\nRobot: “Hello, I am Lexi, an intelligent robot tutor, how can I help you” (Note: answer based on fine-tuning context)\nLearner: “Tell me about the limitations of AI language models like GPT-3?”\nRobot: “AI language models have the potential to revolutionize the way we use language. However, they are still in \ntheir early stages of development and have some limitations. For example, they may not be able to accurately capture \nthe nuances of human language, or they may not be able to handle complex grammar.” (GPT-3 generated)\nLearner: “What nuances?”\nRobot: “The nuances of human language can be difficult to capture with a computer model. For example, the way we \nuse idioms, sarcasm or body language can be lost on an AI system.” (Note: in this case the robot did understand the \ncontext of the short question based on the previous dialogue)\nTechnical implementation: \nA self developed Python module sends a prompt containing the learners speech input and the saved previous dialogue \nbetween the learner and the robot to a fine-tuned GPT-3 model and returns the output of the model via the robot's \nspeech engine. The model is fine-tuned to be a helpful and intelligent robot tutor answering to every question and input. \nThe primary limitations of this implementation are the understanding capabilities of the robot model Pepper ranging \nfrom the microphone input to the external speech-to-text service required for free text input.  \nISBN: 978-989-8704-43-6  © 2022\n94\n4. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION \nThis paper explores the potential of generative language models for interactive learning with social robots in \nthe role of a tutor. The proposed preliminary model presents an approach to utilize generative language models \nsuch as GPT-3 to progress towards more interactive and engaging forms of learning with social robots. The \nmodel connects the different forms of cognitive learning engagement of the learner with the act ivities of the \nrobot tutor and thus shows the linkage and the possibilities of different technical approaches and especially \ngenerative language models. The practical-oriented illustration of the model within the use case of our social \neducational robot points out the impact and the potential for future applications, but also the limitations and \nchallenges in current use. \nGenerative language models offer th e advantage of a more fluent and interactive conversation with the \nlearner. This has major implications for potential computer-based or robot-based learning applications, as these \nmodels allow us to set aside simple keyword detection and predefined answers. Models like GPT-3 understand \nthe context of natural language in a form never achieved before  (cf. Elkins & Chun 2020; Floridi & Chiriatti \n2020; Dale 2021) . The potential of such models in education is accordingly broad; they can be used, for \nexample, as a tool for formative assessment of students in technology -enhanced learning environments  or, \nmore generally, for improved real -time analysis of learning data  (e.g., text or speech analysis) (Blikstein  \n& Worsley 2016; Phillips  et al.  2022). Research groups focusing on automated question generation and \nevaluation based on GPT -3 emphasize the possibility to customize to individual domains and enable higher \nquality questions from a pedagogical perspective  (Bhat et al. 2022). Bommasani et al. (2021) highlight the \ngreater ability for adaptive and personalized learning through the adaption of foundation models in educational \ntechnology. As demonstrated within the use case, the deep understanding of GPT-3 allows the robot tutor to \nassess the learner’s open-ended answers and rationales and consequently provide individualized feedback that \ncan be optionally structured to be corrective, constructive, and motivational based on just a few examples to \nfine-tune the language model. The model can further be fine-tuned based on specific learning content from the \nlearning management system and thus be used in a more human -controlled way and subject -specific. These \nexample applications from the use case show the potential for more interactive learning activities that promise \nhigher learning quality according to the underlying ICAP framework (Chi & Wylie 2014).  \nHowever, the use case, as well as the model itself,  also reveal several limitations in terms of today’s use \nand in terms of future challenges and risks in the context of AI-based generative language models. The current \nuse and combination of retrieval -based and generative text generation are primarily limited by the robot’s \ntechnical limitations in terms of language understanding and processing. As the robot model Pepper relies on \nexternal speech-to-text engines and the GPT-3 model can only be used in the form of a web service, the robot \nrequires a stable internet connection and cannot work independently in such a use case. These external services \nlimit the benefits in many ways and create new challenges and risks in terms of data privacy, data storage, data \nsecurity, dependenc y, and responsibility. Computationally intensive and therefore often cloud -based AI \nservices make increased digital privacy and data protection even more important  (Walsh 2018). Risks and \nlimitations of AI model s further include biased or false information, prejudice, transparency , and copyright \nissues, that raise ethical questions and the demand for a human -in-the-loop (Zanzotto 2019) and explainable \nAI (XAI), particularly in education (Gunning 2017). Other risks associated with the use of educational AI \nsystems may include the potential misuse to monitor students (e.g., their behavior and communication) or the \nrisk of reproducing prevailing ideologies about teaching and learning towards a homogeneous and centralized \nsystem (Blodgett & Madaio 2021) . In the  case of social robots , the central robot control should not be \noutsourced to an external service or language model in order to have integration and interaction of the different \ncomponents in the sense of a social being (e.g., use of cameras for emotion recognition).  \nAs a consequence of these limitations, the use of our social robot in the context of university courses as \nwell as practical workshops is and will be limited to individualization based on the co ntext and not include \npersonalization of the learning content as the LMS interface would allow . In the future, we plan to integrate \nthe individual modules and learning scenarios more effectively, to continuously evaluate them with students \nand teachers, and to further develop them based on surveys and user experiments. In terms of the practical and \ntechnical implementation, it would be interesting to transfer the given use case to more advanced robot models \nbased on the presented model.  As for the research outlook, we hope to see, conduct and discuss more \napplication-oriented research that takes the ideas further and explores the potential of generative language \nmodels for interactive learning with robots and in various pedagogical application domains. \n19th International Conference on Cognition and Exploratory Learning in Digital Age (CELDA 2022)\n95\nREFERENCES \nAdamopoulou, E. & Moussiades, L., 2020, ‘Chatbots: History, technology, and applications’, Machine Learning with \nApplications 2(53), 100006. \nAnderson, L.W. & Krathwohl, D.R., 2001, A taxonomy for learning, teaching, and a ssessing: A revision of Bloom's \ntaxonomy of educational objectives, Longman. \nBelpaeme, T., Kennedy, J., Ramachandran, A., Scassellati, B. & Tanaka, F., 2018, ‘Social robots for education: A review’, \nScience Robotics 3(21), eaat5954. \nBelpaeme, T. & Tanaka, F., 2021, ‘Social Robots as Educators’, OECD Digital Education Outlook 2021 Pushing the \nFrontiers with Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain and Robots: Pushing the Frontiers with Artificial Intelligence, \nBlockchain and Robots 2021, 143. \nBhat, S., Nguyen, H.
