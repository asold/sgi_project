  "full_text": "Dissociating explicit and implicit measures of sensed hand position\nin tool use: Effect of relative frequency of judging different objects\nMiya K. Rand 1 & Herbert Heuer 1\nPublished online: 26 October 2017\n# The Psychonomic Society, Inc. 2017\nAbstract In a cursor-control task, the sensed positions of cur-\nsor and hand are biased toward each other. We previously\nfound different characteristics of implicit and explicit mea-\nsures of the bias of sensed hand position toward the position\nof the cursor, suggesting the existence of distinct neural rep-\nresentations. Here we further explored differences between the\ntwo types of measure by varying the proportions of trials with\nexplicit hand-position (H) and cursor-position (C) judgments\n(C20:H80, C50:H50, and C80:H20). In each trial, participants\nmade a reaching movement to a remembered target, with the\nvisual feedback being rotated randomly, and subsequently\nthey judged the hand or the cursor position. Both the explicitly\nand implicitly measured biases of sensed hand position were\nstronger with a low proportion (C80:H20) than with a high\nproportion (C20:H80) of hand-position judgments, suggesting\nthat both measures place more weight on the sensory modality\nrelevant for the more frequent judgment. With balanced pro-\nportions of such judgments (C50:H50), the explicitly assessed\nbiases were similar to those observed with a high proportion\nof cursor-position judgments (C80:H20), whereas the implic-\nitly assessed biases were similar to those observed with a high\nproportion of hand-position judgments (C20:H80). Because\nstrong weights of cursor-position or hand-position informa-\ntion may be difficult to increase further but are easy to reduce,\nthe findings suggest that the implicit measure of the bias of\nsensed hand position places a relatively stronger weight on\nproprioceptive hand-position information, which is increased\nno further by a high proportion of hand-position judgments.\nConversely, the explicit measure places a relatively stronger\nweight on visual cursor-position information.\nKeywords Reaching . Tool use . Sensory integration .\nImplicit measure . Explicit measure\nPerception relies on multiple sources of information, and mul-\ntisensory integration of redundant estimates of a certain prop-\nerty of an object serves to increase the precision of perception.\nMultisensory integration is generally optimal or almost so in\nthat the weights of the integrated estimates are specified in\nproportion to their relative reliabilities. This goes along with\nminimal variance (or maximal precision) of the combined\nperceptual estimate (e.g., Cheng, Shettleworth, Huttenlocher,\n&R i e s e r ,2007; Ernst & Banks, 2002; Ernst & Bülthoff,\n2004). The benefits of multisensory integration are obvious\nas long as the various estimates refer to the same property of\nthe same object — for example, the position of the hand (van\nBeers, Sittig, & Denier van der Gon, 1999). However, a weak-\ner form of multisensory integration, called sensory coupling\n(e.g., Bresciani, Dammeier, & Ernst, 2006), has also been\nobserved in tool use, in particular in cursor-control tasks,\nwhere proprioception refers to the position of the hand and\nvision to the position of a cursor. Although the hand and cursor\nare clearly different objects, estimates of their respective po-\nsitions become biased toward each other (Debats, Ernst, &\nHeuer, 2017a; Kirsch, Herbort, Ullrich, & Kunde, 2017;\nKirsch, Pfister, & Kunde, 2016; Ladwig, Sutter, & Müsseler,\n2012, 2013;R a n d&H e u e r ,2013, 2016, 2017). These biases\ndepend not only on the sensory input — that is, on the propri-\noceptive and visual information on hand and cursor position,\nrespectively — but also on how the biases are assessed (cf.\nDebats, Ernst, & Heuer, 2017b). Here we explore differ-\nences between two types of assessment that we designate\n* Miya K. Rand\nrand@ifado.de\n1 Leibniz Research Centre for Working Environment and Human\nFactors (IfADo), Ardeystraße 67, 44139 Dortmund, Germany\nAtten Percept Psychophys (2018) 80:211 –221\nhttps://doi.org/10.3758/s13414-017-1438-y\n\nas explicit and implicit measures of the bias of sensed\nhand position.\nThe explicit measure of the bias of sensed hand position is\nbased on psychophysical judgments. After a reaching move-\nment of constant amplitude and variable direction and the\nreturn to the starting position, participants move their hand\nalong a circular path to its remembered position at the end of\nreaching. These judgments are psychophysical judgments of\nthe perceived and remembered positions of the hand that par-\nticipants are consciously aware of. The deviation of these\njudgments from the physical position of the hand serves as\nan explicit measure of the bias of sensed hand position toward\nthe position of the cursor. The implicit measure of the bias of\nsensed hand position, in contrast, is based on the movements\nof the participants without them being aware of judging the\nposition of their hand. As is detailed in the Method section,\nthis measure is the angle between the reaching movement and\nthe return movement back to the starting position. Its rationale\nis based on the observation that discrepancies between the\nsensed and physical locations of the hand give rise to system-\natic errors in subsequent movements (Bock & Eckmiller,\n1986;H e u e r&S a n g a l s ,1998; Heuer & Sülzenbrück, 2012;\nHolmes, Crozier, & Spence, 2004; Holmes & Spence, 2005;\nRossetti, Desmurget, & Prablanc, 1995).\nIn previous studies, we observed a number of differences\nbetween the implicit and explicit measures (Rand & Heuer,\n2013, 2016, 2017). The explicit measure of the bias of sensed\nhand position is substantially stronger and more variable than\nthe implicit measure. Individual explicitly and implicitly\nassessed biases are uncorrelated. Only the explicitly measured\nbias, but not the implicitly measured bias, becomes stronger at\nolder adult age (Rand & Heuer, 2013), weaker with increased\nrelative reliability of proprioceptive input (Rand & Heuer,\n2016), and interindividually less variable after visuomotor ad-\naptation (Rand & Heuer, 2017). These differences and disso-\nciations are consistent with the notion of two different neural\nrepresentations of hand position (e.g., Dijkerman & de Haan,\n2007; de Vignemont, 2010; Head & Holmes, 1911; Paillard,\n1991), similar to cognitive (perceptual, explicit) and motor\n(action-oriented, implicit) representations of visual stimuli\n(e.g., Bridgeman, Lewis, Heit, & Nagle, 1979; Milner &\nGoodale, 1995, 2008).\nIn the present study, we continued our search for differ-\nences between explicit and implicit assessments of the bias\nof sensed hand position toward the position of the cursor. In\nparticular, we compared the effects of different proportions of\ntrials in which participants have to judge explicitly either the\nposition of the hand or the position of the cursor. Our hypoth-\nesis that this manipulation might affect explicitly and implic-\nitly assessed biases differently was based on the following\nconsiderations. First, different proportions of trials in which\ncursor and hand positions have to be judged should result in a\nstronger or a weaker weight of the hand position in the\ncoupled estimate. A stronger or a weaker weight of the hand\nposition in the coupled estimate, which is conceptualized as a\nweighted average, implies a weaker or a stronger bias, respec-\ntively. Second, with equal proportions of trials with hand-\nposition and cursor-position judgments, hand position might\nhave a relatively stronger weight for implicitly assessed biases\nthan for explicitly assessed biases. A stronger weight should\nbe more easily reduced than increased, and a weaker weight\nshould be more easily increased than reduced. We elaborate\nthese considerations in more detail.\nAmong the classic findings on reaction times is the\nrelative-frequency effect: In a binary choice task, the reaction\ntime to the more frequent of two signals is faster than the\nreaction time to the less frequent signal (e.g., Fitts, Peterson,\n& Wolpe, 1963). The more frequent signal is also more fre-\nquently expected, with faster reaction times for correctly than\nfor incorrectly expected signals (Hinrichs, 1970), and expec-\ntations of the more frequent signal are more frequently correct.\nThe higher relative frequency of one of two types of trials goes\nalong with a higher number of repetitions, and repetitions\ntypically facilitate performance (cf. Cheng, Luis, &\nTremblay, 2008; Khan, Elliott, Coull, Chua, & Lyons, 2002;\nKi\nrby,1980; Song & Nakayama, 2007; Zelaznik, Hawkins, &\nKisselburgh,1983). Notably, as compared with alternations\nbetween two types of trials, repetitions of one type facil-\nitate the selective processing of individual stimulus fea-\ntures. This is evident from the costs of switching between\ntasks as compared with task repetitions, in which tasks are\ndefined by the selective processing of one of at least two\ndifferent stimulus features (see Kiesel et al., 2010;\nMonsell, 2003, for reviews). Findings such as these sug-\ngest that relative frequency can serve to modulate the\nselectivity of information processing.\nIn the present experiment, we varied the proportions of\ntrials with explicit judgments of cursor (C) and hand (H) po-\nsition in ratios of C80:H20 and C20:H80. We expected that\nwith these different proportions, either the visual information\non cursor position (with C80:H20) or the proprioceptive in-\nformation on hand position (with C20:H80) would become\nprioritized so that its weight in sensory coupling would be\nincreased. We had two reasons for this expectation. First, the\nmore frequently given judgments could result in more reliable\nestimates of either cursor position or hand position, and a\nhigher reliability would be associated with a stronger weight\n(cf. Debats et al., 2017b). Second, the weights in sensory\ncoupling are also likely to depend on factors other than rela-\ntive reliabilities (cf. Sober & Sabes, 2005). Thus, they might\nalso be affected directly by the experimental conditions, not\nmediated by the different reliabilities of the perceptual esti-\nmates. In terms of observed biases rather than weights in sen-\nsory coupling, the bias of sensed hand position toward the\ncursor position should be stronger with a higher proportion\nof cursor-position judgments than with a higher proportion of\n212 Atten Percept Psychophys (2018) 80:211 –221\nhand-position judgments. This should be observed for explic-\nitly and/or implicitly assessed biases. For the bias of sensed\ncursor position toward the hand position, the effects of the\ndifferent relative frequencies should be the opposite. This\ncan be observed for the explicitly assessed bias of sensed\ncursor positions only because we are not aware of a suitable\nimplicit procedure comparable to our implicit assessment of\nt h eb i a so fs e n s e dh a n dp o s i t i o n .\nThe second consideration that gave rise to our hypothesis\nthat implicit and explicit measures of the bias of sensed hand\nposition toward the position of the cursor might be affected\ndifferently by different proportions of trials with explicit judg-\nments of cursor and hand positions was the following: With a\nC50:H50 proportion, hand position might have a relatively\nstronger weight for the implicitly than for the explicitly\nassessed bias. In principle, different weighting for psycho-\nphysical judgments and motor responses would be possible\n(Knill, 2005). A stronger weight for hand-position informa-\ntion could be the reason for the consistently smaller size of the\nimplicitly assessed bias of sensed hand position, which would\ngo along with a smaller intra-individual variability (Rand &\nHeuer, 2013, 2016, 2017). If indeed hand position has a stron-\nger weight for the implicit than for the explicit assessment, it\nmight be difficult to increase the weight any further. This\nwould be consistent with our previous finding that additional\nproprioceptive input served to strengthen the hand-position\nweight for the explicit assessment, but not for the implicit\nassessment (Rand & Heuer, 2016).\nTaking into account all the considerations, we tentatively\nexpected the following effects from three conditions with dif-\nferent proportions of trials of explicit cursor-position and\nhand-position judgments — C80:H20, C50:H50, and\nC20:H80. (1) For C20:H80, the hand-position weight in sen-\nsory coupling should be stronger than the same weight in\nC80:H20. Therefore, the bias of the sensed hand position to-\nward the position of the cursor should be weaker. (2) This\ndifference between the two conditions might not be the same\nfor implicit and explicit assessments. (3) For explicit assess-\nments of cursor position, the difference between the C20:H80\nand C80:H20 conditions should be the opposite: The cursor-\nposition weight in sensory coupling should be weaker in con-\ndition C20:H80, and thus, the bias of the sensed cursor posi-\ntion toward the position of the hand should be stronger. (4)\nRegarding the C50:H50 condition, there should be a stronger\nweight of hand position for implicit than for explicit assess-\nments. Thus, there might be a smaller increase of its\nweight (and decrease of its bias) with a higher proportion\nof hand-position judgments in condition C20:H80 for im-\nplicit than for explicit assessments. With the smaller pro-\nportion of hand-position judgments in condition C80:H20,\nin contrast, there might be a greater decrease of the hand-\nposition weight (and increase of the bias) for implicit than\nfor explicit assessments.\nMaterials and method\nParticipants\nTwenty-eight healthy right-handed young adults (mean [ SD]\nage: 22.6 [2.8] years; 15 males and 13 females) signed in-\nformed consent prior to participating in the study. The study\nwas conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki\nand with the approval of the ethics committee of the Leibniz\nResearch Centre for Working Environment and Human\nFactors.\nApparatus and procedure\nThe experimental setting and procedures were similar to those\nin our previous studies (Rand & Heuer, 2013, 2016). In brief,\nseated participants held a stylus with their right hand and made\nthree-stroke movements on a digitizer (Wacom Intuos 4 XL,\n133-Hz sampling rate) while looking at a monitor. The mon-\nitor was covered by a large black circular screen with a semi-\ncircular window (32 cm in diameter) in its center. A first target\n(T1, 1.4 cm in diameter) was located in that center, and the\nstart position (SP, 1.2 cm in diameter) was located 3 cm below\nT1. A second target (T2, 1 cm in diameter) was presented at\npseudo random locations, ranging from –60° to + 60° relative\nto the central location, on an invisible circle with a radius of\n15 cm around T1. Corresponding to this circle, the workspace\non the digitizer was bordered by a semi-circular plastic ring,\nthe Bstopper ring, ^ with a radius of 15 cm around T1. An\nopaque board placed above the participants’arm blocked their\ndirect view of the hand movements.\nAt the beginning of each trial, participants were guided to\nthe SP by arrows shown on the monitor. One second after the\nstylus was in the SP, T2 appeared for 1 s (Fig. 1a, 1st panel).\nSubsequently, T1 appeared. After a delay of 0.5 s, an auditory\ngo signal was delivered. The participants then made three\nstroke movements, from the SP to T1 (1st stroke), to T2\n(2nd stroke), and back to T1 (3rd stroke), at a comfortable\nspeed. When the 1st stroke reached T1, this target disap-\npeared. Then the participants made the 2nd stroke to the re-\nmembered T2 (Fig. 1a, 3rd panel) until the movement was\nstopped by the stopper ring. Afterward, they made a return\nmovement (3rd stroke) back to the remembered T1 location\n(Fig. 1a, 4th panel).\nThe participants made the 1st and 2nd strokes with concur-\nrent visual feedback provided by a cursor on the monitor, but\nthe 3rd strokes without visual feedback. During the 2nd\nstrokes, however, the direction of cursor motion was rotated\nrelative to the direction of hand movement by an angle ran-\ndomly chosen out of six (clockwise [CW] direction: – 25°, –\n15°, – 5°; counterclockwise [CCW] direction: 5°, 15°, 25°).\nThus, the participants had to adjust their movements so that\nAtten Percept Psychophys (2018) 80:211 –221 213\nthe cursor on the monitor would move toward the remembered\nT2 location (Fig. 1a, 3rd panel).\nOne second after completion of the 3rd stroke (Fig. 1a,4 t h\npanel), the participants were asked to judge either the hand or\nthe cursor position at the end of the 2nd stroke. To indicate the\ntype of judgment to be performed, either the word BHand^ (for\na judgment of hand position) or BCursor^ (for a judgment of\ncursor position) appeared briefly in the center of the monitor,\ntogether with an arrow pointing to either the right (for a judg-\nment using a CCW motion) or the left (for a judgment using a\nCW motion). Thence, the specified judgment followed.\nFor the judgment of cursor position ( explicit cursor\njudgment; Fig. 1a, 5th panel, top), a short line moved either\ncounterclockwise or clockwise along the edge of the display\nwindow at a constant speed. The participant instructed the\nexaminer to stop and finely adjust (back and/or forth) the line\nto the position that matched the remembered position of the\ncursor at the end of the 2nd stroke. For the judgment of hand\nposition ( explicit hand judgment ;F i g . 1a, 5th panel,\nbottom), the participant moved the pen from the right\n(or left) lower corner of the stopper ring counterclockwise\n(or clockwise) along the ring and stopped where he or she\njudged the hand position to match the remembered posi-\ntion of the hand at the end of the 2nd stroke. Note that the\nmotion of the visual marker and the movement of the\nhand during the judgments differed from the cursor mo-\ntion and hand movement, respectively, during the 2nd\nstroke. Therefore, only positions on the circular path\ncould be matched, but not the movement directions and/\nor amplitudes of the 2nd strokes. The type of explicit\njudgment (hand or cursor position) was randomized\nacross trials, but with different relative frequencies ac-\ncording to experimental condition. The direction of line\nor hand movement during the judgment (clockwise or\ncounterclockwise) was randomized across trials with the\nconstraint of equal frequencies.\nThe three experimental conditions differed in the relative\nfrequencies of trials with explicit judgments of hand and cur-\nsor position. The first condition had proportions of 80%\ncursor-judgment trials (144 trials) and 20% hand-judgment\ntrials (36 trials), and is referred to as C80:H20. The second\ncondition ( C50:H50 ) had proportions of 50% cursor-\njudgment trials (90 trials) and 50% hand-judgment trials (90\ntrials), and the third condition ( C20:H80) had 20% cursor-\njudgment trials (36 trials) and 80% hand-judgment trials\n(144 trials). The experiment was conducted over three days\n(one condition per day). The order of conditions was approx-\nimately counterbalanced across participants.\nBefore the C80:H20 (or C20:H80) condition, the partici-\npants were informed that most of the trials would require\ncursor (or hand) judgments. They were also told that although\nonce in a while different judgments would be required, the\nbest strategy would be to pay attention to the cursor (or hand)\nposition. Before the C50:H50 condition, the participants were\ninformed that cursor and hand judgments would occur equally\noften, and they were instructed to pay attention to both the\ncursor and hand positions in each trial.\nBefore data recording on the first day of the experiment,\neight familiarization trials without the judgment were per-\nformed that included the procedure with/without the visual-\nfeedback rotation, as well as four warm-up trials that included\nthe entire procedure (two trials each for hand and cursor judg-\nments). The same four warm-up trials were also performed\non the second and third days of the experiment. There\nwere six sets of trials (each of which included one\nwarm-up trial and 30 experimental trials) for each condi-\ntion. A short break was inserted after each set. A total of\n540 experimental trials (180 trials per day) were recorded\nand analyzed for each participant.\nHand position at \n3rd-stroke end\nT1\nSensed \nhand position\nα\nα’\nHand position at \n2nd-stroke end\nLine B\nLine A\nLine B’\nb\na Cursor position\njudgment\nTime\nHand position\njudgment\nRotated visual feedback\nHand \nCursor\n2nd stroke\nT1 Hand \n3rd stroke\nSP\nT2\nSP\nT1\nFig. 1 Behavioral task of a three-stroke movement and judgments of\nhand and cursor positions.

In brief, positions were mea-\nsured in a polar coordinate system with the origin in T1, and\nonly the angles were analyzed because the distance from the\norigin was constant for all judged and physical positions of the\nhand and cursor at the end of the 2nd stroke. In each trial, the\nangular deviation of the judged hand or cursor position from\nthe actual hand or cursor position at the end of the 2nd stroke\nwas determined (the CCW direction had a positive sign) and\nserved as the explicit measure of the bias in that trial.\nIndividual means and standard deviations of the angular devi-\nations were computed for the judged directions of cursor and\nhand for each condition (C80:H20, C50:H50, or C20:H80)\nand each visual-feedback rotation. The overall influence of\nthe rotated visual feedback on the angular deviations of the\njudged from the actual hand or cursor positions was assessed\nby the slope of the linear regression of the angular deviation\n(dependent variable) on the visual-feedback rotation (indepen-\ndent variable), which was computed for each participant, ex-\nperimental condition, and judged position (cursor or hand).\nThese slope parameters specify the strength of sensory cou-\npling in terms of the proportional biases of the judgments of\nhand and cursor positions in degree per degree of the visual-\nfeedback rotation.\nAs an implicit measure of the bias of sensed hand position\ntoward the position of the cursor in each trial, we computed\nthe angular deviation of the direction of the 3rd stroke from\nthe direction of the 2nd stroke — that is, α' = α in Fig. 1b.T h i s\nmeasure exploits the existence of error propagation in succes-\nsive aiming movements, in particular the propagation of errors\nthat originate from visually induced deviations between the\nphysical and sensed positions of the hand. In our case, the\nvisually induced deviations of the sensed position of the hand\nfrom the actual position at the end of the 2nd stroke (angle α'\nin Fig. 1b) resulted from the rotated visual feedback, and these\ndeviations were estimated from the angular error of the return\nmovement (angle α in Fig. 1b). When the sensed position\ndeviated in the CCW or CW direction from the actual position\nof the hand, the angular deviation ( α')h a dap o s i t i v eo rn e g -\native sign, respectively. Individual means and standard devia-\ntions of the angular deviations were computed for each exper-\nimental condition and each visual-feedback rotation across\ntrials with explicit hand-position judgments. Trials with ex-\nplicit cursor-position judgments were neglected for the implic-\nit measure of the bias of sensed hand direction, so that the\nexplicit and implicit measures would be based on the same\nset of trials. The angular deviations α' were subjected to the\nsame linear regressions as the angular deviations of the explic-\nit judgments of hand position from the actual position, to\nobtain a measure of the implicitly assessed bias as a proportion\nof the visual-feedback rotation.\nThe data were screened for outliers both among trials and\namong participants. On the basis of the linear regressions ap-\nplied separately for each type of bias assessment (explicit cur-\nsor, explicit hand, implicit hand), each condition (C80:H20;\nC50:H50, C20:H80), and each participant, trials with angular\ndeviations outside the range of predicted deviations ±3 stan-\ndard deviations of the residuals were eliminated as outliers\namong the trials. In total, 0.48% of experimental trials were\nremoved from all analyses. Subsequently, the bias parameters\nfor each type of assessment and each condition were screened\nfor outliers among participants. The means and standard\ndeviations across all participants were calculated for the\nthree types of measurement and the three conditions, and\nbias parameters outside the range of mean ±3 standard\ndeviations were defined as outliers. These computations\nwere repeated until no further outliers were found. As the\nresult, two participants were identified as having outliers\nfor the explicitly assessed b ias of cursor direction and\nwere excluded from all analyses.\nThe individual regression coefficients of the explicit and\nimplicit bias measures of hand direction were subjected to a 3\n(Proportion: C80:H20, C50:H50, C20:H80) × 2 (Type of\nMeasure: hand-explicit, hand- implicit) repeated measures\nanalysis of variance (ANOV A). Our main interest was in the\ninteraction, which would indicate different effects of the dif-\nferent proportions of cursor-judgment and hand-judgment tri-\nals on the explicit and implicit measures of the bias of sensed\nhand position toward the position of the cursor. For these\ninteraction tests, we split the three-level factor proportion into\ntwo orthogonal contrasts, with coefficients – 1, 0, 1 (linear\ntrend) and 1, – 2, 1 (quadratic trend) for the conditions\nC80:H20, C50:H50, and C20:H80, respectively. The interac-\ntion of type of measure with the first of these contrasts tests\nwhether the difference between C80:H20 and C20:H80 is dif-\nferent between the two types of measure. The interaction with\nthe second contrast tests whether the deviation from equal\ndifferences between the three proportions (nonlinearity) is dif-\nferent for the explicit and implicit measures. (More specifical-\nly, for conditions C80:H20, C50:H50, and C20:H80, we\nassigned coefficients – 1,\n0, 1 for the explicit measure and 1,\n0, – 1 for the implicit one, respectively, to test the interaction\nof type of measure with the linear trend of the proportion, and\ncoefficients 1,–2, 1 for the explicit measure and, –1, 2, –1f o r\nthe implicit one, respectively, to test the interaction of type of\nmeasure with the quadratic trend of the proportion).\nWe ran additional analyses for the explicitly assessed bias\nof sensed cursor position together with the explicitly assessed\nbias of sensed hand position and for the individual standard\ndeviations (i.e., intra-individual variation) of the biases. The\nexplicit biases of sensed cursor and hand position were ana-\nlyzed in the same way as the explicit and implicit biases of\nsensed hand position.

Mauchly’s test was used to test for violations of\nsphericity. In case of violations, Greenhouse –Geisser epsilon\nis reported, and statistical significance was evaluated using the\ncorrected degrees of freedom.\nResults\nThe main purpose of the present study was to test whether\nexplicit and implicit measures of the bias of sensed hand po-\nsition toward the position of the cursor are affected differently\nby variation of the proportions of trials with explicit cursor-\nposition and hand-position judgments. The respective find-\nings are presented first. Next, we report the intra-individual\nvariability of implicit and explicit measures of the bias of\nsensed hand position and finally the analyses of the explicit\nmeasures of the bias of sensed cursor and hand positions.\nExplicit and implicit measures of the bias of sensed hand\nposition\nThe mean angular deviations of the judged hand position from\nthe physical position showed steep positive slopes as a func-\ntion of the visual-feedback rotation for all three different pro-\nportions of cursor-position and hand-position judgments (Fig.\n2a, hand-explicit), indicating a strong explicitly assessed bias\ntoward the position of the cursor. As for the implicit measure\nof the bias of sensed hand position, the mean angular devia-\ntions of the return movements also had positive slopes as a\nfunction of the visual-feedback rotation for all different pro-\nportions of explicit cursor-position and hand-position judg-\nments (Fig. 2a, hand implicit), again indicating a bias toward\nthe cursor position. However, these slopes were less steep than\nthose observed for the explicit measure. A 3 (Proportion) × 2\n(Type of Measure) ANOVA of the individually estimated\nbiases (slopes of the linear regressions) revealed the main\neffect of type of measure to be significant [ F(1, 25) = 44.48,\np <. 0 0 1 ] .\nThe means of the individually estimated biases (Fig. 2b)\nshow more clearly than Fig. 2a the variations across the three\nproportions C80:H20, C50:H50, and C20:H80 for both the\nexplicit and implicit measures of the bias of sensed hand po-\nsition. For both measures (Fig. 2b, hand-explicit and hand-\nimplicit), the bias was stronger in condition C80:H20 — that\nis, with a strong weight on the cursor position in the coupled\nestimate— than in condition C20:H80 — that is, with a strong\nweight on the hand position in the coupled estimate. The\nANOV A revealed that the main effect of proportion was mar-\nginally significant [F(2, 50) = 3.10, p = .054]. The linear trend\nof the proportion effect (based on the contrast coefficients 1, 0,\n– 1 being assigned for both types of measure to conditions\nC80:H20, C50:H50, and C20:H80, respectively) was signifi-\ncant [F(1, 25) = 8.65, p = .007], indicating that the C80:H20\nand C20:H80 conditions differed significantly when the two\ntypes of measure were pooled. Conversely, the quadratic trend\nof the proportion effect (based on the contrast coefficients 1, –\n2, 1 being assigned for both types of measure to conditions\nC80:H20, C50:H50, and C20:H80, respectively) was not sig-\nnificant [F(1, 25) = 0.64, p = .430], indicating no nonlinearity\nof the C50:H50 condition relative to the other two conditions\nwhen both types of measure were pooled.\nAs for the interaction between the type of measure and\nproportion, the linear trend of proportion (contrast coefficients\na\nC80:H20\nC50:H50\nC20:H80\nRotation angle (°)\n-25 -15 -5 5 15 25\n-20\n-10\n0\n10\n20\nAngular deviation (°)\nHand-\nExplicit\nHand-\nImplicit\nCursor-\nExplicit\nb\nHand-\nImplicit\nHand-\nExplicit\nCursor-\nExplicit\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8Bias\nC80:H20\nC50:H50\nC20:H80\nFig. 2 (a) Mean explicit and implicit measures as a function of the\nrotation of the visual feedback.

This indicates that the differences between conditions\nC80:H20 and C20:H80 were similar for the two types of mea-\nsure. In contrast, the conspicuous difference between the two\nmeasures was the bias in the condition C50:H50. The bias in\nthis condition was close to the bias in condition C80:H20\n(strong weight of cursor position) and different from the bias\nin condition C20:H80 (strong weight of hand position) for the\nexplicit measure. For the implicit measure, in contrast, the bias\nin condition C50:H50 was close to the bias in condition\nC20:H80 (strong weight of hand position) and different from\nthe bias in condition C80:H20 (s trong weight of cursor posi-\ntion). This dissociation was confirmed by a significant differ-\nence [ F(1, 25) = 7.42, p = .012] of the quadratic trends of\nproportions between the two types of measure (contrast coeffi-\ncients 1, – 2, 1 for conditions C80:H20, C50:H50, and\nC20:H80; see the details in the Method section).\nIntra-individual variability of biases of sensed hand\nposition\nIn Fig. 3a, the mean intra-individual standard deviations of ex-\nplicitly and implicitly assessed biases of sensed hand position\nare plotted as a function of the rotation of visual feedback. The\nindividual standard deviations of the implicit measure (Fig. 3a,\nhand-implicit) were substantially smaller than those of the ex-\nplicit measure (hand-explicit), which was confirmed by a signif-\nicant main effect of type of measure [ F(1, 25) = 206.27,\np < .001] in a 3 (Proportion) × 2 (Type of Measure) × 6\n(Visual-Feedback Rotation) ANOVA. We found no systematic\ndifferences between the three proportions C80:H20, C50:H50,\nand C20:H80 [ F(2, 50) = 0.34, p = .711]. The main effect of\nvisual-feedback rotation was significant [ F(5, 125) = 9.59,\nɛ =. 6 1 ,p < .001], and so was the interaction between type of\nmeasure and visual-feedback rotation [ F(5, 125) = 3.04,\np = .013]. The increase of intra-individual variability at the\nlargest visuomotor rotations was somewhat stronger for the ex-\nplicit than for the implicit measure (Fig.3a). No other significant\neffects were found.\nExplicit measures of the biases of sensed cursor and hand\npositions\nThe mean angular deviations of the judged cursor position\nfrom the corresponding physical position showed slightly\nnegative slopes as a function of the visual-feedback rotation\n(Fig. 2a, cursor-explicit), indicating a weak bias of the judg-\nments of cursor position toward the position of the hand. The\nindividually estimated biases (slopes of the linear regressions)\nwere multiplied by – 1 to make them comparable with the\nbiases of sensed hand position, and their means are plotted\nin Fig. 2b (cursor-explicit). The 3 (Proportion) × 2 (Type of\nMeasure) ANOV A showed that the obviously stronger bias of\nhand-position judgments than of cursor-position judgments\ngave rise to a significant main effect of type of measure\n[F(1, 25) = 111.41, p < .001], whereas the main effect of\nproportion was not significant [ F(2, 50) = 2.29, p =. 1 1 2 ] .\nAs\nfor the interaction between the proportion and type of\nmeasure, the bias of sensed cursor position (cursor-explicit)\nwas weaker in condition C80:H20 than in condition C20:H80,\nwhich contrasted with the results for the bias of sensed hand\nposition (Fig. 2b, hand-explicit). Thus, there was a trade-off\nbetween the explicitly assessed biases of sensed hand position\nand sensed cursor position, the former being stronger in con-\ndition C80:H20 and the latter being weaker. The linear trend\nof proportion (contrast coefficients 1, 0, – 1 for conditions\nC80:H20, C50:H50, and C20:H80; see the details in the\nMethod section) was significantly different between the ex-\nplicit measures of the biases of sensed cursor and hand\na\nb\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14SD of angular deviation (°)\n-25 -15 -5 5 15 25\nRotation angle (°)\n-25 -15 -5 5 15 25\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14SD of angular deviation (°)\nC80:H20\nC50:H50\nC20:H80\nHand-Explicit\nHand-Implicit\nCursor-Explicit\nFig. 3 Mean standard deviations ( SD) of the explicit and implicit\nmeasures as a function of rotation of the visual feedback.

The\nsum of the hand and cursor biases is an estimate of the strength of\nsensory coupling, independent of the asymmetry of the biases\n(cf. Debats et al.,2017b). The means (and standard errors) of the\ncoupling strength were .67 ± .051, .71 ± .056, and .65 ± .050 for\nthe conditions C80:H20, C50:H50, and C20:H80, respectively.\nIntra-individual variability of explicitly assessed biases\nThe mean intra-individual standard deviations of the explicit\nmeasure of the bias of sensed cursor position were generally\nsmall (Fig. 3b), considerably smaller than those of the explicit\nmeasure of the bias of sensed hand direction (Fig. 3a,h a n d -\nexplicit). The 3 (Proportion) × 2 (Type of Explicit Measure) ×\n6 (Visual-Feedback Rotation) ANOVA showed that the differ-\nence between the two explicit measures was significant [ F(1,\n25) = 224.60, p < .001]. In addition, we observed a significant\nmain effect of visual-feedback rotation [ F(5, 125) = 9.45, ɛ =\n.64, p < .001] and an interaction between type of explicit\nmeasure and visual-feedback rotation [ F(5, 125) = 2.65, ɛ =\n.71, p = .044]. No other significant effects were found, includ-\ning no systematic differences between the three conditions\nC80:H20, C50:H50, and C20:H80. Nevertheless, it is note-\nworthy that the smaller bias of cursor judgments in condition\nC80:H20 than in condition C20:H80 was associated with a\nsmaller variability in condition C80:H20 than in C20:H80\n(4.36 versus 5.22 deg), whereas the stronger bias of hand\njudgments in condition C80:H20 was associated with a slight-\nly larger variability than in condition C20:H80 (12.20 ver-\nsus 12.09 deg). The interaction of type of measure with\nthe linear trend of proportion (contrast coefficients 1, 0, –\n1 for conditions C80:H20, C50:H50, and C20:H80; see\nthe details in the Method section) fell just short of statis-\ntical significance [ F(1, 25) = 3.12, p = .089].\nDiscussion\nThe main results of the present study are: (1) both the explic-\nitly and implicitly assessed biases of sensed hand position\ntoward the position of the cursor were stronger with a low\nproportion of hand-position judgments (C80:H20) than with\na high proportion (C20:H80); (2) the explicitly assessed bias\nof sensed cursor position toward the position of the hand\nshowed the opposite pattern — namely, weaker bias with a\nlow proportion of hand-position judgments (C80:H20) than\nwith a high proportion (C20:H80); (3) with a balanced pro-\nportion (C50:H50), the explicitly assessed bias of sensed hand\nposition was similar to the one observed with a high propor-\ntion of cursor-position judgments (C80:H20), whereas the im-\nplicitly assessed bias of sensed hand position was similar to\nthe one observed with a high proportion of hand-position\njudgments (C20:H80). We discuss these findings in turn.\nCommonalities of implicit and explicit measures\nof the bias of sensed hand position\nBoth the explicitly and implicitly assessed biases of sensed\nhand position decreased wh en the proportion of hand-\nposition judgments increased from 20% to 80% of the trials,\nand this decrease was similar in magnitude for both types of\nmeasure. A decrease of the bias of sensed hand position can\nindicate a reduction of the strength of sensory coupling or a\nchange of its asymmetry (cf. Debats et al., 2017b). Sensory\ncoupling implies mutual biases, which are biases of sensed\nhand position and of sensed cursor position in the present\nstudy. When the strength is reduced, both biases become\nsmaller, so that their sum becomes smaller. When the asym-\nmetry is changed, the one bias is reduced whereas the other\none is increased, so that their sum remains unchanged. The\npresent results of the explicitly assessed bias of sensed hand\nposition showed clear evidence that its reduction at a higher\nproportion of trials with explicit hand-position judgments is\ndue to a change of the asymmetry of sensory coupling, not to a\nchange of its strength. At a higher proportion of trials with\nhand-position judgments, the explicitly assessed bias of\nsensed cursor position was increased, and this increase com-\npensated the reduction of the bias of sensed hand position. The\nsum of both biases, that is, the measure of coupling strength,\nremained unchanged.\nFor the implicitly assessed bias of sensed hand position, we\nare neither aware of a corresponding implicit assessment of\nthe sensed cursor position nor did we measure it in this study.\nHence, we found no direct evidence that the change of the\nimplicitly assessed bias of sensed hand position was also\ndue to a change of the asymmetry of sensory coupling, rather\nthan to a reduction of coupling strength. However, there is\nindirect evidence that a modulation of the asymmetry of sen-\nsory coupling by different proportions of explicit hand-\nposition and cursor-position judgments was present for the\nexplicitly assessed bias. At the same time, there are no obvious\nreasons why coupling strength should be modulated only for\nthe implicitly assessed bias — which would be different from\nthe explicit assessment of the bias.\nHow do the effects of the relative proportions of trials with\nexplicit cursor-position and hand-position judgments on the\nasymmetry of sensory coupling come about? Although the\nfindings on attentional effects on sensory coupling are rather\nmixed (e.g., Macaluso et al., 2016; Odegaard, Wozny, &\n218 Atten Percept Psychophys (2018) 80:211 –221\nShams, 2016; Talsma, Doty, & Woldorff, 2007; Talsma,\nSenkowski, Soto-Faraco, & Woldorff,2010), the present find-\nings suggest that a higher proportion of hand-position judg-\nments results in focusing attention on the relevant propriocep-\ntive information, and a higher proportion of cursor-position\njudgments in focusing attention on the relevant visual infor-\nmation. Thus, relative frequency among two types of judg-\nments may serve to modulate the attentional selectivity and\nthe related information processing.\nA strong determinant, though not the only one, of the\nweights in sensory coupling is the reliability of the individual\nestimates of cursor position and hand position (cf. Debats\net al., 2017b). The present findings on the modulation of the\nasymmetry of sensory coupling induced by different propor-\ntions of cursor-position and hand-position judgments might\nwell be mediated by the relative reliabilities of the individual\nestimates that result from the modulation of attentional selec-\ntivity. In particular, with a high frequency of hand-position\njudgments, attention might be focused on proprioceptive in-\nformation, resulting in a high reliability of hand-position esti-\nmates and low reliability of cursor-position estimates. With a\nhigh frequency of cursor-position judgments, conversely, at-\ntention might be focused on visual information, resulting in a\nhigh reliability of cursor-position estimates and low reliability\nof hand-position estimates. Such hypothetical differences in\nreliability of the individual sensory estimates should to some\nextent be reflected in the variabilities of the coupled sensory\nestimates. In fact, the mean standard deviations observed with\nhigh and low proportions of explicit cursor-position and hand-\nposition judgments revealed the corresponding pattern,\nthough statistically the interaction was nonsignificant.\nDifferences between implicit and explicit measures\nof the bias of sensed hand position\nThe explicitly and implicitly assessed biases of sensed hand\nposition in the condition with equal proportions of explicit\nhand-position and cursor-position judgments (C50:H50) had\ndifferent locations in the range of biases spanned by the con-\nditions with an imbalance of cursor-position and hand-\nposition judgments (C80:H20 and C20:H80). More specifical-\nly, the implicit measure of the bias in condition C50:H50 was\nsimilar to that in condition C20:H80, which is the condition\nwith a stronger weight on hand-position information.\nConversely, the explicit meas ure of the bias in condition\nC50:H50 was similar to that in condition C80:H20, which is\nthe condition with the stronger weight on cursor-position\ninformation.\nThese findings suggest that the implicit measure of the bias\nof sensed hand position places stronger weight on propriocep-\ntive hand-position information, whereas the explicit measure\nplaces stronger weight on visual cursor-position information.\nWe assume that a strong weight is hard to increase further, but\neasy to reduce, whereas a weak weight is easy to increase, but\nhard to reduce further. When the importance of hand-position\ninformation is further increased in condition C20:H80 as com-\npared with condition C50:H50, the already strong weight of\nhand-position information for the implicit measure is not in-\ncreased further, so that the implicitly assessed bias of sensed\nhand position is not reduced. However, the weaker weight of\nhand-position information fo r the explicit measure is in-\ncreased, resulting in a reduced explicitly assessed bias of hand\nposition. Conversely, when the importance of cursor-position\ninformation is further increased in condition C80:H20 as com-\npared with C50:H50, the low weight of cursor-position infor-\nmation for the implicit measure is increased, so that the im-\nplicitly assessed bias of sensed hand position becomes stron-\nger. However, the already strong weight of cursor-position\ninformation for the explicit measure is not, so that the explic-\nitly assessed bias of sensed hand position is not increased.\nThe conclusion that the implicit measure of the bias of\nsensed hand position places relatively stronger weight on pro-\nprioceptive hand-position information and the explicit mea-\nsure relatively stronger weight on visual cursor-position infor-\nmation is consistent with at least two earlier observations. The\nfirst one is the consistent finding that the implicitly assessed\nbias of sensed hand position toward the cursor position is only\nabout half as strong as the explicitly assessed bias (Fig. 2;\nRand & Heuer, 2013, 2016, 2017). This could result from a\nstronger weight of hand-position information in the implicit\nthan in the explicit measure, consistent with the smaller vari-\nability of the implicitly assessed bias than the explicitly\nassessed one (Fig. 3a). The second consistent finding is the\neffect of strengthening the proprioceptive hand-position infor-\nmation by providing unimodal proprioceptive input at the end\nof reaching (Rand & Heuer, 2016). With a balanced propor-\ntion of hand- and cursor-position judgments (C50:H50), it\nresulted in a reduced explicitly assessed bias of sensed hand\nposition, corresponding to a stronger weight of the proprio-\nceptive hand-position information, but had no effect on the\nimplicitly assessed bias. Thus, further strengthening of the\nproprioceptive input either by means of additional input or a\nhigh proportion of hand-position judgments does not affect\nthe relative weights of the two modalities in implicit estimates\nof sensed hand position, but it does so in explicit estimates.\nTo summarize, we have previously observed a number of\ndifferent properties of the implicit and explicit measures of\nsensed hand position, as we briefly described in the introduc-\ntion (Rand & Heuer, 2013, 2016, 2017). The present study\nex\ntends the previous findings by revealing the different sensi-\ntivity of the two measures to the proportion of trials with\nexplicit hand-position and cursor-position judgments. The dif-\nferences accumulated in our series of studies support the no-\ntion of at least two distinct neural representations of hand\nposition (e.g., de Vignemont, 2010; Dijkerman & de Haan,\n2007;H e a d&H o l m e s , 1911; Paillard, 1991), similar to\nAtten Percept Psychophys (2018) 80:211 –221 219\ncognitive (perceptual, explicit) and motor action-oriented\n(implicit) representations of visual stimuli (e.g., Bridgeman\net al., 1979; Milner & Goodale, 1995, 2008). Of course, there\nmay be more representations, but only two representations can\nbe distinguished in the present study, based on two distinct\nmeasures. In spite of the differences, the explicit and implicit\nmeasures of the bias of sensed hand position also share com-\nmonalities. For example, the common variation of both types\nof bias measures between the lowest and highest proportions\nof hand-position judgments suggests that the CNS applies the\nreliability-based weighting principle (Debats et al., 2017b)i n\ncoupling visual and proprioceptive information for both im-\nplicit and explicit measures.\nAuthor note This research was supported by the German\nResearch Foundation (DFG) [grant number Ra 2183/1 –3].\nWe thank Maleen Greine and Franziska Schywalski for their\nsupport in data collection.\nReferences\nBock, O., & Eckmiller, R.
