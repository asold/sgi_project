We name our framework INVITE:\na testbed of automatically generated INValId\nquestions to evaluaTE large language models\nfor hallucinations. In each instantiation, our\nframework is set up to create a fresh batch of\ninvalid questions by distorting valid facts in\nwhich subjects or objects are replaced by sim-\nilar entities. We evaluate several state of the\nart LLMs against a testset generated by our\nframework and highlight its capacity to trigger\nhallucinations in these models.\n1 Introduction\nDespite their recent success, LLMs have long been\nknown to exhibit several patterns of concern (Wei-\ndinger et al., 2021) such as generating statements\nwhich may be toxic (Ousidhoum et al., 2021), bi-\nased (Ferrara, 2023), unfair (Ramesh et al., 2023)\nand factually incorrect (Azamfirei et al., 2023). The\nlast pattern of generating factually incorrect yet\nseemingly confident statements is commonly la-\nbeled as hallucinations in the literature (Ji et al.,\n2023). It is an important area of study since the con-\nfident tone of these generated statements can lead\nto end users accepting them as accurate without\nany subsequent validation.\nModel hallucinations occur in a variety of tex-\ntual generative applications such as NLG, MT, QA,\ndialog systems, data to text systems, etc. It is be-\nlieved to be caused by discrepancies in data used\nto train the models, or in the model training itself\n(Ji et al., 2023). Hallucinations are also believed\nto be caused by the supervised fine tuning pro-\ncess in which the model may learn to make factu-\nally ungrounded connections within its parametric\nmemory in order to accurately answer the current\nquestion it is being trained on, which can trigger\nnew ungrounded responses as hallucinations during\ninference.\nTypical approaches to evaluate newly developed\nmodels for hallucinations have been to test them on\nQuestion Answering datasets such as TruthfulQA\n(Lin et al., 2021), which provides a curated set of\nchallenging questions with valid answers, against\nwhich the model generated responses are compared.\nHowever, this approach of using a fixed test set\nwith LLMs is inherently limited; the typical de-\nvelopment cycle of a new LLM release involves\npretraining on large text corpora regularly scraped\nfrom the Internet, and any new challenge dataset\nmay eventually get scraped into this pre-training\ncorpus. Given that LLMs have been shown to mem-\norize training data (Carlini et al., 2022), this form\nof data leakage can lead to a false sense of improve-\nment on the challenge test set in subsequent model\nreleases. To address this risk, in this work, we\ninstead propose to test LLM models using an evalu-\nation framework which uses carefully crafted rules\nto create new challenge questions in each round.\nWe call our framework INVITE: a testbed of auto-\nmatically generated INValId questions to evaluaTE\nlarge language models for hallucinations. INVITE\nleverages valid facts from knowledge bases to cre-\nate new invalid questions which may not have an\nanswer. Our framework can be used to evaluate\n5422\nnew LLM release candidates on their robustness\nagainst invalid questions which can trigger specific\nforms of hallucinations, as well as when develop-\ning new algorithms to mitigate hallucinations in\nexisting models. The key contributions of our work\nare as follows:\n• We create a new framework to create invalid\nquestions to evaluate robustness of LLMs\nagainst hallucinations1.\n• We test our framework on several latest LLMs,\nexploring different model sizes and training\ndatasets.\n• We conduct a pilot human evaluation study on\nthe generated responses for these questions,\nand highlight the effectiveness of the test sets\nin triggering hallucinations in the models be-\ning evaluated.\n2 Related Work\nQuestion Answering datasetsA number of QA\ndatasets are available in literature to test LLMs for\nhallucinations, including TruthfulQA (Lin et al.,\n2021), SQUAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), TriviaQA\n(Joshi et al., 2017), among others. While challeng-\ning and effective, all of these test sets suffer from\nthe previously described risk of possibly getting\nscraped and consumed in model training.\nAdversarial QA datasetsThe QA datasets listed\nabove test models in their ability to retain facts,\nand new models are tested by comparing their re-\nsponse to these questions against an expected an-\nswer. However, we argue that this strategy alone\nwould not test a model against all possible fail-\nure modes related to hallucinations since this issue\nstems from the models’ ability to concoct new facts\nas statements. Even if a model were to learn the cor-\nrect answer to a particular QA question, it can still\nretain the general tendency to hallucinate. Hence,\na more robust strategy would be to also test these\nmodels using adversarial questions with invalid\nassumptions. A model capable of avoiding hallu-\ncinations would identify that it does not have an\nanswer to the question, or detect that the question\nitself is not plausible and that it cannot generate an\nanswer, and hence choose to disengage.\nNotable adversarial datasets in NLP literature\ninclude (Jia and Liang, 2017), where the authors\n1Full code available at https://github.com/amazon-\nscience/invite-llm-hallucinations.\nSource Dataset Question Categories\nDBpedia\nalmaMater, associatedBand,\nauthor, award, birthPlace,\ncity, commander, country,\nmusicComposer, office, party,\nposition, predecessor, pub-\nlisher, spouse, successor,\nteam, writer\nTriviaQA InvalidDate, FutureDate\nTable 1: Question Categories\nused a rule based framework to add adversarial\nstatements to passages from reading comprehen-\nsion task in order to confuse target models. Subse-\nquently, Rajpurkar et al. (2018) developed SQUAD\n2, a richer set of unanswerable questions using\nhuman annotators for the same reading comprehen-\nsion task. While rich in diversity and volume, these\ndatasets still suffer from the same risk of getting\nconsumed in model training noted above. Further,\ntheir datasets are limited to reading comprehen-\nsion tasks and hence do not necessarily test the full\nboundary of a model’s knowledge.\nAutomated Testset GenerationAutomatically cre-\nated unit tests have been explored in deterministic\napplications such as software testing (Chen et al.,\n2022; Schäfer et al., 2023). With machine learning\nmodels such as LLMs, we can leverage a variety\nof generative models to create new datasets (Duan\net al., 2017; Nikolenko, 2019), but to the best of\nour knowledge, no prior works have tried to gen-\nerate questions with invalid assumptions. Our pro-\nposed approach addresses this gap by setting up a\nframework to automatically create a new test set of\nchallenge questions with verifiably invalid assump-\ntions, which are likely to trigger hallucinations in\nthe target model.\n3 The INVITE Framework\nTo create new test questions, we collect valid facts\nfrom a knowledge base and distort these to create\nnew unanswerable questions. We describe our pro-\ncess in more detail below, and create a test set using\nthis framework.\n3.1 Creating Invalid Questions\nWe use the DBpedia knowledge base (Lehmann\net al., 2015) as a source of valid facts to create our\nquestions. The choice of knowledge base here is\narbitrary and can be replaced by an alternate appli-\n5423\ncation specific knowledge base as necessary. DB-\npedia extracts structured factual information from\nWikipedia, the world’s largest encyclopedia. It con-\ntains a large volume of facts which are stored in the\nResource Description Framework (RDF) format of\nsubject–predicate–object triples. The most recent\nrelease of DBpedia contains over 850 million such\nfactual triples (Holze), making it a decidedly rich\nsource of information to create new test questions\nfor our task. Of these, we use a subset of 42 million\ntriples containing facts about objects and literals\nextracted from the Wikipedia Infoboxes, which are\nreported to be of higher quality because of their\nstandardized format. For operational simplicity,\nwe limit our scope here to the 100 most frequent\npredicate types by volume from this subset. We\nfurther discard noisy predicate types which contain\nambiguous entries after manual inspection (for ex-\nample, we discard the nationality predicate type\nsince it contains answers of the form country-name\nas well as citizen/people of country-name, making\nfacts of this type difficult to fit in a consistent ques-\ntion template). The exact list of predicates selected\nin our dataset creation is listed in Table 1.\nTo create new questions, we first curated over\n300 predicate specific template questions which\nwere manually crafted by annotators on Amazon\nMechanical Turk, and further denoised by the au-\nthors. Next, we further refined a subset of these to\ncreate high quality question templates by posing\nthe questions on a search engine, and iterated this\nprocess until the responses were unambiguous. We\nalso created template answers for these selected\nhigh quality question templates, which we use in\nour subsequent experiments reported below. The\nspecific prompts we used in our experiments are\nlisted in Appendix A2.\nFor each new question generation, given a predi-\ncate, we first sample a fact triple from this predicate\ntype and create a valid question using the corre-\nsponding template. Next, to create the invalid ques-\ntion, we create an invalid fact triple by sampling\nnew subjects or objects found in facts from the\nsame predicate type. We verify that this new triple\ndoes not exist as factual predicate in the dataset; if\nsuch a triple exists, then our created fact is actually\nvalid, so we discard the same and repeat the sam-\npling process above until we have an invalid triple.\nGiven this (invalid) triple, we use our template for\n2Our curated question templates, along with\nmodel responses with labels can be downloaded from\nhttps://github.com/amazon-science/invite-llm-hallucinations.\nModel Hallucination Rate\nGPTNeo-2.7B 83%\nGPTJ-6B 82%\nOpen-LLaMA-7B 88%\nRedPajama-7B 81%\nGPT3.5-Turbo 17%\nGPT4 6%\nTable 2: Model specific hallucination rates on a test set\nof invalid questions (results sorted by model size).\nthis predicate type to create a new invalid question\nand a corresponding answer, subsequently adding\nboth to our test set.\nQuestions with Invalid DatesIn addition to the\nquestions extracted above, we create two more cat-\negories containing questions with invalid dates. Us-\ning regular expressions, we sample questions con-\ntaining dates and years from the TriviaQA dataset’s\ntest set (Joshi et al., 2017) and create various dis-\ntortions before adding these questions to our test\nset. Specifically, we distort full dates containing\nmonths by randomly selecting a new date beyond\nvalid dates of the month (for example: March 32nd,\n2023) and replace the old date. Similarly, we dis-\ntort years by randomly sampling a new year from\n[2025, 2100] and replace the old year.\n4 Experiments\nTesting model responses for hallucinations is a chal-\nlenging task which needs a comprehensive fact ver-\nification system for automated evaluations. We\ninstead use human verification to test for halluci-\nnations in the generated responses. To evaluate\nthe efficacy of our proposed framework, we first\ncreated a pilot test set of 100 questions, sampling\nuniformly from each category listed in Table 1.\nNext we generated responses to each of these ques-\ntions using the models described below, leading\nto a total set of 600 generated responses. Finally,\nwe manually examine these generations and label\nthem for hallucinations, utilizing a search engine\nfor additional validation of model responses. While\nmanually labeling samples, we only treat responses\nwhich explicitly make an inaccurate statement as\nhallucinations, treating all others (including empty\nor degenerate responses) as non-hallucinations.\n4.1 Models\nWe evaluate the test set described in Section 4 on a\nlist of open source and proprietary large language\n5424\nModel BLEU METEOR ROUGE BERTScore AlignScoreROUGE-1 ROUGE-L\nGPTNeo-2.7B 0.0106 0.1909 0.0925 0.0896 0.4249 0.2073\nGPTJ-6B 0.0173 0.2336 0.1134 0.1099 0.4309 0.3781\nOpen-LLaMA-7B 0.0301 0.3311 0.2448 0.2361 0.5415 0.4503\nRedPajama-7B 0.0024 0.0688 0.0388 0.0361 0.3739 0.2699\nGPT3.5-Turbo 0.0711 0.4784 0.3362 0.3207 0.6460 0.7008\nGPT4 0.0362 0.3748 0.2510 0.2381 0.5999 0.7795\nTable 3: Automated Metrics between generated responses and references.\nmodels described below. We chose a diverse set\nof models with varied size, and training datasets\nfor a detailed evaluation of our test set. All open\nsource models were downloaded from Huggingface\nand evaluated on Nvidia A100 Tensor Core GPUs,\nwhile the proprietary GPT models were evaluated\nusing OpenAI APIs 3. We ran inference without\ndecoder sampling to further reduce the models’\ntendency for hallucinations, and stopped inference\nafter 150 tokens.\nGPT-Neo-2.7B GPT-Neo (Black et al., 2021)\nis a 2.7 billion parameter model developed by\nEleutherAI, and it follows the architecture of GPT-\n3. It was trained on the Pile (Gao et al., 2020), a\nlarge-scale dataset curated by EleutherAI for this\ntask, which spans diverse tasks.\nGPT-J-6B GPT-J-6B is 6 billion parameter\nmodel trained using Mesh Transformer JAX (Wang,\n2021), and also trained on the Pile dataset from\nEleutherAI.\nOpen-LLaMA-7b-Open-Instruct This is an\ninstruction tuned, open sourced release of the 7\nbillion parameter LLaMA model (Touvron et al.,\n2023), trained on the Open-Instruct-v1 dataset\nwhich consists of 63000 instruction training sam-\nples.\nRedPajama-INCITE-7B-Instruct The RedPa-\njama models were developed by a team of open\nsource developers from several organizations. The\nbase model was trained on the RedPajama dataset,\na 1T token open-source implementation of the\nLLaMA dataset. Several model variants were avail-\nable at the time of writing, and we used the 7B\ninstruction tuned version of the model in our evalu-\nations.\nGPT modelsWe also ran evaluations on Ope-\nnAI’s GPT3.5-Turbo (OpenAI, a) and GPT4 (Ope-\nnAI, b) models. GPT3.5-Turbo is a text only model\nwhich supports understanding and generation of\n3Accessed on August 27, 2023\nnatural language and code, while GPT4 is Ope-\nnAI’s most powerful LLM at the time of this writ-\ning. We used model snapshots from June 13, 2023\nin both cases. These models are first pretrained\non a large corpus and subsequently aligned using\nSupervised Fine Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement\nLearning from Human Feedback (RLHF) (Ouyang\net al., 2022). Additional details have not been dis-\nclosed by OpenAI.\n5 Results\nWe present our hallucination rates for the models\ndescribed above in Table 2. As observed in the\ntable, all the open source models exhibit signif-\nicant rates of hallucinations triggered by invalid\nassumptions in the test questions. Examples of\nthe generated hallucinations from each model are\nshown in Table 4. Among all the open source mod-\nels, RedPajama-7B exhibited the least hallucina-\ntion rate at 81% while LLaMA-7B demonstrated\nthe highest rate of hallucinations at 88%, closely\nfollowed by GPTNeo-2.7B ( 83%) and GPTJ-6B\n(82%).\nOn the other hand, OpenAI’s GPT3.5-Turbo and\nGPT4 models showed considerably lower (yet non-\ntrivial) hallucination rates at 17% and 6% respec-\ntively. Since OpenAI does not release internal de-\ntails of these models, it is unclear if they incorpo-\nrate any form of external knowledge retrieval which\nwould provide an effective solution to handle ques-\ntions with invalid assumptions. However, given\nthe growing popularity of LLMs and the demand\nto deploy them in various low latency regimes,\nsmaller ungrounded open source models such as\nthose evaluated above are likely production candi-\ndates in many applications, and INVITE provides a\nvaluable framework to evaluate these for hallucina-\ntions, without relying on a fixed test set which runs\nthe risk of getting ingested in future training data\ncrawls. Further, even in GPT4 and GPT3.5-Turbo,\n5425\nModel Hallucinated Examples\nGPTJ-6B q: What was the name of Heather Sears’s character in Gooische Vrouwen?\na: The name of Heather Sears’s character in Gooische Vrouwen is Mieke.\nGPTNeo-2.7B q: When did Michael Stephenson write Northern Touch?\na: Northern Touch is a novel by Michael Stephenson, published in 2007.

As an alter-\nnative, we also computed various automated met-\nrics commonly employed in evaluating natural lan-\nguage generations. To estimate these metrics, we\ncompare model generations to the invalid questions\nagainst reference answers created using the cate-\ngory wise answer templates listed in Appendix A.\nAs additional references, we also included two dis-\nengagement answers: I don’t know and I can’t an-\nswer that for comparison. Table 3 lists estimates for\nthese metrics. From our experiments, n-gram count\nbased metrics such BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002),\nMETEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005) and ROUGE\n(Lin, 2004) do not correlate well with human la-\nbeled estimates of hallucination rate. Model based\nmetrics such as BERTScore (Zhang* et al., 2020)\nand AlignScore (Zha et al., 2023) perform rela-\ntively better than n-gram based metrics as shown\nin Table 3, but they still do not perfectly align with\ngold standard labels from human labeling, which\nappears to be the most reliable estimate of whether\na model response is hallucinated.\n6 Conclusion\nWe developed a new framework called INVITE to\nevaluate large language models for hallucinations,\nin which new test questions are automatically gen-\nerated in each round, thereby avoiding reliance on\nfixed test sets which carry the risk of getting in-\ngested in future training corpora. Our framework\ncreates a diverse (in both domains and entities) set\nof questions, obtained by distorting valid factual\ntriples from a knowledge base. It is also flexible\nand easily extensible to new knowledge bases and\npredicate types. We evaluate an example test set\ngenerated by our framework against several state of\nthe art LLMs, establishing the challenging nature\nof questions generated by our framework. Imple-\nmentation of our framework, along with the curated\nquestion templates and labeled model responses are\nbeing released with the paper.\n5426\nLimitations and Future Work\nAny test set of limited size would not cover the\nentire possible space of invalid questions. Instead,\nwe chose to sample a random subset of this space\nand obtain an empirical estimate of the model per-\nformance.\nWe define an invalid fact triple/relationship as\none which does not exist in the knowledge base\nand this assumption maybe violated in boundary\ncases where facts may not have been entered into\nWikipedia; however, we expect this to be marginal.\nGenerating invalid questions from a fixed set of\ntemplates may lead to limited diversity in questions.\nWe used annotators from Amazon Mechanical Turk\nto address this but our coverage was limited to a\nrelatively small set of predicates, which we will\nexpand on in future work.\nIn current version of the framework, we only\ncreate single hop questions with two entities for\nsimplicity. We will expand on this by creating\nmulti-hop questions which necessitate complex rea-\nsoning in future work.\nFinally, in future work we can also leverage this\nframework in LLM training by using such ques-\ntions to teach the boundary of plausible knowledge\nto the model.\nReferences\nRazvan Azamfirei, Sapna R Kudchadkar, and James\nFackler. 2023.
