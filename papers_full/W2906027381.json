    "abstract": "A thermal analysis of a 5 kVA dry-type transformer under linear and non-linear loads conditions is studied in this paper. The main goal here is to calculate the hottest-spot transformer temperature under free convection through the resolution of the heat conduction equation in three dimensions (3D) using COMSOL Multiphysics®. The proposed technique was validated through experimental data obtained in laboratory. The temperature inside the cores was measured under the influence of free convection. The radiation emission was also measured through a thermal camera. The heat transfer coefficient for both conditions was obtained from empirical correlations. The hottest-spot temperatures were determined from the analysis in the commercial software which was used for the numerical simulations of the transformer heating and cooling under some loading conditions. The temperature residuals, that is, the experimental temperature values subtracted by the numerical temperature values, were below 10%. The numerical analysis found that the hottest-spot temperatures in the core reached 20 °C above the transformer insulation limit. The location of the hottest-spot as well as the obtained temperatures can be used to improve more resistant dry-type transformers.",
