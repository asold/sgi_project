The conceptual model was based on flow theory and the technology interactivity \nmodel. This model was extended to include the impact of both readability and transparency. The data were \ncollected using an online questionnaire survey posted to 500 customers of courier, package delivery, and express \nmail services. The statistical results largely supported the role of readability, transparency, personalisation, \nresponsiveness, and ubiquitous connectivity in shaping the virtual flow experience with chatbots, which in turn \nhas a significant impact on both communication quality and satisfaction. This study opens new horizons for \nresearchers and practitioners to consider dimensions other than satisfaction and intention to use, to facilitate and \naccelerate the pace of success of chatbot applications. However, several areas have not been fully addressed in \nthe current study which could be worth considering in future research, as discussed in the related subsection.   \n1. Introduction \nTechnology plays an integral part in consumers' daily life, and many \nshopping activities (product search, payment, actual buying, and even \npost-purchase services) are conducted in the digital marketing and e- \ncommerce worlds ( Kar and Kushwaha, 2021 ; McLean and Osei- \nFrimpong, 2019 ; Moore, 2018; Wang et al., 2021 ). In line with this \nshift in consumer behaviour, organisations seek to exploit artificial in -\ntelligence (AI) applications to enhance the quality of services provided \nto customers, and thus create more unique, positive, and personalised \nexperiences ( Aladwani and Dwivedi, 2018 ; Allal-Ch ´erif et al., 2021 ; \nBhawiyuga et al., 2017 ). By using such AI applications, marketers and AI \nsystem developers are also able to better predict customers' needs and \nbehaviours, and help organisations in the decision-making process \n( Forrest and Hoanca, 2015 ; Tintarev et al., 2016 ). Chatbots have been \nconsidered among the most important and popular AI applications that \nserve companies' endeavours in this context ( Adam et al., 2021 ; Kush -\nwaha et al., 2021 ; Paikens et al., 2020 ). In this respect, 25% of customer \nservice activities are expected to be conducted using virtual agent sys -\ntems, such as chatbots ( Gartner, 2016 ; Marketer, 2018 ; Moore, 2018 ). \nChatbots have been playing an increasingly significant role in the new \nera of digital marketing and information systems, especially in cus -\ntomers' service interactions, which have been transforming from \n‘human-driven to technology-dominant ’ ( Selamat and Windasari, \n2021 ). \nConceptually, chatbots are defined as ‘machine conversation system \n[s] [that] interact with human users via natural conversational lan -\nguage ’ ( Shawar and Atwell, 2005, p. 489 ). The ‘bot ’ in the term chatbot \nrefers to ‘robot ’ and reflects the fact that chatbots are a smart system that \nrobotically connects and interacts with customers in a manner similar to \nhuman beings ( Okuda and Shoda, 2018 ). In recent years, customer \nservice areas have improved tremendously, especially in terms of \ncustomer contact and communication ( Kushwaha and Kar, 2020 ; \nKushwaha et al., 2021 ; Xu et al., 2020 ). Using more updated and smart \ninterfaces (i.e. virtual agents and chatbots) allows customers to chat and \ninteract live with their service providers, and therefore, provides faster \n* Corresponding author. \nE-mail addresses: baabdullah@kau.edu.sa (A.M.

In fact, \nvirtual agents (i.e. chatbots) have increasingly replaced the role of \nhuman agents and traditional of customer service methods ( Patil et al., \n2019 ). Chatbots have proved their capabilities in providing real value to \nboth customers and business organisations. For example, a recent report \nby Statista (2021) indicated that the market value of chatbots is ex -\npected to reach 6.83 billion U.S. dollars. Further, a recent report indi -\ncated that the adoption of chatbot applications by business organisations \nhas increased significantly, reaching 93% in the year 2020. Customers \nare also more interested in using chatbot applications to communicate \nwith their service providers, with a usage rate of 24% ( Drift, 2020 ). \nIn the courier services sector, the importance of chatbots is evident, \nas customers need smart applications that can automatically track the \ndelivery status of their shipment ( Adam et al., 2021 ; Selamat and \nWindasari, 2021 ). This would satisfy the customer's need for constant \ncontact with their service providers and for up-to-date and accurate \ninformation regarding their orders and shipments ( Adam et al., 2021 ). \nFurthermore, in 2020, under the influence of COVID-19 and the condi -\ntions of the lockdown, companies, especially those working in the field \nof logistics and supply chain services, began to seek alternative smart \nsolutions such as chatbots to communicate with their customers and \nserve them without any interruption ( Viola et al., 2021 ). This, in turn, \nhas led to significant growth in the global chatbots market, whose value \nhas reached USD 2.9 billion ( Marketer, 2021 ). In addition, chatbot ap -\nplications often help service organisations cut customer service expenses \nby 30%, as reported by Marketer (2021) . \nIn this context, chatbots can considerably help service organisations \nshape their customers' experiences and retain their market share \n( Kushwaha et al., 2021 ). Thus, providing a smooth and sophisticated \ncustomer experience has been a main motivation for courier service \ncompanies to extensively adopt and rely on chatbots as a new mecha -\nnism ( Androutsopoulou et al., 2019 ; Cui et al., 2017 ; Ngai et al., 2021 ). \nThis could be reflected in the ability of chatbots to predict customers' \nattitudes and emotional and conative engagement, and consequently, \ntheir satisfaction and loyalty ( Araujo, 2018 ; Sivaramakrishnan et al., \n2008 ). Kunze (2016) also noted the significance of personalised features \nthat chatbots could provide customers by tailoring information and \nrecommendations based on their preferences. However, little attention \nhas been paid to the implications of chatbots in this area. \nThe majority of chatbots studies have focused exclusively on cus -\ntomers' intention, adoption, and satisfaction with such systems; how -\never, customers' virtual flow experience also calls for further analyses \nand examinations ( Brandtzaeg and F ø lstad, 2017 ; Zarouali et al., 2018 ; \nZumstein and Hundertmark, 2017 ). As a smart means of communica -\ntion, chatbots' success also largely depends on their ability to enhance \ncommunication quality with the targeted customers. Therefore, it is \nimportant to consider the interactive nature of chatbots and how this \ncan impact customers' virtual flow experience. Accordingly, this study \naims to investigate how customers' flow experience with chatbots could \naccelerate the communication quality between customers and \norganisations. \nThe success of chatbots in creating a unique and positive customer \nexperience depends largely on certain critical factors, such as the pro -\nposed conversation content factors (readability and transparency) or the \nchatbots-as-systems factors (responsiveness, personalisation, and ubiq -\nuitous connectivity). Some of these factors are related to the ability of \ncustomers to accurately read and fully understand the chatbots' text \nreplies. In turn, to match customers' expectations, chatbots will need to \nfully understanding their input and enquiries and replying to them \naccurately ( Sheehan et al., 2020 ). Therefore, readability is one of the \nmain factors that can predict customers' virtual experience. Further, the \nperception of conversation transparency could reflect the extent to \nwhich the customer is interested in interacting with chatbots. However, \naspects related to chatbots' conversation readability and transparency \nhave not been fully addressed by previous studies in related areas. \nTherefore, the linguistic features of chatbots conversation and how they \ncould shape human interaction with such applications need to be \nexamined. \nIn general, the current study intends to address the following \nresearch questions:  \n(i) How do readability and transparency shape customers' virtual \nflow experience with AI-powered chatbots?  \n(ii) How do interactive features (i.e. responsiveness; personalisation; \nand ubiquitous connectivity) predict customers' virtual flow \nexperience with AI-powered chatbots?  \n(iii) To what extent does customers' virtual flow experience with AI- \npowered chatbots contribute to communication quality and \ncustomer satisfaction? \nThis study will hopefully expand the current understanding of the \naspects that could shape customers' virtual experiences with AI- \nchatbots. Further, the by concentrating on customers' virtual flow \nexperience with chatbots, this study attempts to contribute to opening \nnew horizons for researchers and practitioners to consider dimensions \nthat have not been fully addressed by prior studies. Furthermore, the \ncurrent study offers a set of recommendations and guidelines to improve \nchatbot design which, in turn, guarantees a positive and unique \ncustomer experience. \n2. Literature review \nIn addition to the practitioners' interest in the implementation of \nchatbots to provide a unique and personalised customer experience, \nresearchers have begun focusing on chatbot-related issues, especially \nover the last five years ( Dwivedi et al., 2017 ; Lim et al., 2021 ; Selamat \nand Windasari, 2021 ; Sheehan et al., 2020 ; Stieglitz et al., 2022 ; Sung \net al., 2021 ). A close and careful review of the chatbots literature helps \nidentify the features and aspects that have been considered in prior \nstudies in this area. The common themes that have been considered by \nextant studies of chatbots have centred on customer intention and \nadoption ( Brachten et al., 2021 ; Fittkau, 2017 ); users' personal and \nprofile characteristics ( Jin and Youn, 2021 ; Mahmud et al., 2022 ; Van \nden Broeck et al., 2019 ); drivers of ( Drift, 2018 ) and barriers to ( Help -\nshift, 2018 ) chatbot use; chatbot features ( Rese et al., 2020 ); online \ncustomer experience ( Jim ´enez-Barreto et al., 2021 ; Kushwaha et al., \n2021 ); and trust and perceived risk ( Kushwaha et al., 2021 ; Rese et al., \n2020 ). \n2.1. Adoption and acceptance of chatbots \nStudies that have focused on customer adoption and acceptance of \nchatbots (i.e. Drift, 2018 ; Helpshift, 2018 ; Kasilingam, 2020 ; Selamat \nand Windasari, 2021 ; Sheehan et al., 2020 ) have also proposed and \ntested different factors and features that could facilitate or hinder cus -\ntomers' behavioural intention and adoption of chatbots. For example, \nSelamat and Windasari (2021) have proposed a model based on the \ntechnology acceptance model (TAM) that integrates ease of use and \nperceived usefulness with anthropomorphism and entertainment. Their \nempirical results largely confirm that usefulness and perceived enjoy -\nment play a role in shaping customers' intention to use chatbots, which \nneither anthropomorphism nor ease of use do. Further, in their explor -\natory study, Kar and Kushwaha (2021) have reported a number of en -\nablers of the adoption of AI systems, such as innovation, product \nnewness, research development, and flexibility, while failure concerns \nand upgrading concerns were key hindrances to AI system adoption. \nKasilingam (2020) tested both customer attitudes and intention to \nuse AI chatbots in the Indian e-commerce market context and proposed a \nmodel based on the TAM with other factors (i.e., perceived risk, trust, \nprice consciousness, perceived enjoyment, and innovativeness). His re -\nsults largely support the mediating role of attitudes between perceived \nusefulness and customer intention to use AI chatbots. Similarly, Rese \nA.M. Baabdullah et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \nTechnological Forecasting & Social Change 181 (2022) 121772\n3\net al. (2020) have adopted the uses and gratifications (U & G) theory to \ntest customers' behavioural intention to use AI chatbots. Based on the \ndata collected from online shoppers in Germany, they found a significant \ninfluence of both conversation authenticity and perceived enjoyment on \nonline shoppers' intention to use chatbots. However, those online \nshoppers who perceive a high level of privacy concerns and see chatbots \nas an immature technology were less interested in using such emerging \nconversation systems. \n2.2. Trust in chatbots \nIn a qualitative study, F ø lstad et al. (2018) tested the main features \nthat could shape customer trust in chatbots. Their results, based on in -\nterviews with 13 customers who actually use chatbots, reported the \nimportance of the quality of responses and interpretation in predicting \ncustomer trust in chatbots. Furthermore, the authors argued that chat -\nbots' ability to simulate human interaction and provide a sense of self- \npresentation are also important for customer trust. Aspects related to \nperceived security and privacy were also reported by chatbot users as \nkey drivers of their trust in such emerging systems ( F ø lstad et al., 2018 ; \nJanssen et al., 2018 ). Kasilingam (2020) also supported the role of trust \nin predicting both attitudes and intention to use AI chatbots. More \nrecently, Jin and Youn (2021) tested the impact of new features per -\ntaining to chatbots (i.e. parasocial interaction and relationship type) on \nbrand personality aspects (i.e. competence and sincerity). They proved \nthe impact of parasocial interaction and relationship type on brand \npersonality aspects, and thus, accelerated customer trust in online \nshopping websites and satisfaction. \n2.3. Chatbots features \nChung et al. (2020) , in their study of the online luxury brands sector, \nfound that aspects related to AI chatbots — namely interactivity, trendi -\nness, entertainment, customisation, and problem solving — considerably \nshape communication quality (accuracy and credibility) between con -\nsumers and brands. Furthermore, these aspects also significantly \nenhance customer satisfaction. Other aspects, such as call length and \nactual purchasing behaviour, were considered by Luo et al. (2019) . They \nempirically tested and confirmed that perceived knowledge and \nperceived empathy in AI chatbots impact call length, which in turn \npredicts actual purchase behaviour. More recently, Kushwaha and Kar \n(2021) developed and tested the MarkBot framework, which employs an \nAI application to respond to a website user's browse via the product \ncatalogue. They applied a long short-term memory recurrent neural \nnetwork (LSTM) to predict user replies through chatbots. They authors \nnoted that the proposed model could decrease the time limit that the \ncompany needs to adopt MarkBot. \n2.4. Customer experience with chatbots \nA few studies have attempted to examine how AI chatbots can in -\nfluence online customer experience (i.e. Arya et al., 2019 ; Chen et al., \n2021 ; Jim ´enez-Barreto et al., 2021 ; Kushwaha et al., 2021 ; Verma et al., \n2021 ). For example, within the context of online retailing, Chen et al. \n(2021) empirically tested the main predictors of online customer expe -\nrience based on the TAM model. Their results largely supported the \ncrucial impact of ease of use and usefulness on customers' cognitive (i.e. \nextrinsic) experience, while chatbot responsiveness has a more signifi -\ncant impact on the affective (intrinsic) part of the customer experience. \nFurther, they statistically proved that customers who have a positive \nonline experience with AI applications in general are more likely to be \nsatisfied with their company. In particular, they considered two di -\nmensions to capture the customer's online experience with AI-chatbots: \nintrinsic and extrinsic. The authors also addressed the role of usability \nand responsiveness in shaping the customer online experience with AI- \nchatbots. Furthermore, Verma et al. (2021) , through their systematic \nreview, confirmed the positive role of AI-enabled chatbots in acceler -\nating customer experience. \nTo predict customer experience with AI chatbots, Kushwaha et al. \n(2021) integrated a comprehensive model based on various theories: \ncustomer experience theory, Hoffman and Novak's model of flow in \ninteractive computer-mediated environments (CME), customer experi -\nence theory, IS success model, commitment trust theory, and diffusion of \ninnovation. The model was able to predict approximately 57.40% of \ncustomer experience with AI chatbots. They authors also found that \nservice quality, brand trustworthiness, transparency, telepresence, \nperceived risk, challenges, and skills significantly impacted customer \nexperience with AI chatbots. In particular, motivational customer \nexperience was tested by Jim ´enez-Barreto et al. (2021) using a novel \nmodel based on self-determination and assemblage theories, and a \nmixed-method approach based on both quantitative and qualitative \ndata. They empirically confirmed the impact of self-determined inter -\naction dimensions (competence, autonomy, and relatedness) on cus -\ntomers' experience with AI chatbots, which was also proven to positively \ndetermine customers' attitudes toward such emerging systems. Trivedi \n(2019) considered IS success model factors and perceived risk to \nexamine customer experience with AI chatbots. Their empirical results \nconfirmed the impact of information, service, and system quality on \ncustomer experience and that perceived risk moderates the relationship \nbetween IS success factors and customer experience. Trivedi also noted \nanother interesting relationship, between customer experience with \nchatbots and brand love. \n2.5. Literature gap \nRegardless of the value added by prior studies examining customer \nexperience with chatbots, customers' virtual flow experience, as pro -\nposed by Koufaris (2002) and Csikszentmihalyi and LeFevre (1989) , has \nnot been fully addressed in such contexts. Furthermore, two dimensions \ncaptured in the flow experience (enjoyment and concentration/atten -\ntion focus) have not been fully covered or tested by chatbot studies. This \npresents a significant gap which should be fully addressed to understand \nhow customers can effectively and successfully interact with chatbots. \nTesting customers' virtual flow experience with chatbots is important \nbecause it could significantly improve a chatbot system, which is highly \ndependent on consumer concentration/attention focus and his/her \nsense of enjoyment. There is also a lack of studies addressing the impact \nof the interactive nature of chatbots on customers' virtual flow experi -\nence. In fact, interactive features such as personalisation, responsive -\nness, and ubiquitous connectivity could play a crucial role in predicting \naspects pertaining to customers' virtual flow experience (i.e. consumer \nconcentration/attention and enjoyment). Therefore, these aspects are \nworth testing in this study. As discussed in the introduction, the success \nof chatbots relies on the ability of such systems to provide content and \nconversations that are characterised by a high degree of readability. \nHowever, the impact of readability on customers' virtual flow experi -\nence in general and with chatbots, in particular, has not received \nadequate attention in prior studies. This study attempts to address this \ngap by examining the impact of readability on customers' virtual flow \nexperience. Furthermore, the vast majority of chatbots studies have \nfocused on retailing (i.e. Rese et al., 2020 ); B2B (i.e. Kushwaha et al., \n2021 ); airlines (i.e. Jim ´enez-Barreto et al., 2021 ); hotels (i.e. Sheehan \net al., 2020 ); luxury brands ( Chung et al., 2020 ); SMEs ( Selamat and \nWindasari, 2021 ); banking (i.e. Trivedi, 2019 ); advertising (i.e. Sharma \net al., 2021 ; De Cosmo et al., 2021 ); online shopping (i.e. Kasilingam, \n2020 ); and healthcare (i.e. Abd-Alrazaq et al., 2019 ). Thus, despite the \nhighly sensitive area of courier services and the major role that chatbots \nmay play in improving the experience of communication with the con -\nsumer, no study has addressed the related issues of customer virtual flow \nexperience with chatbots in the courier services sector. This, in turn, \nmotivates the empirical focus of the current study in the courier, pack -\nage delivery, and express mail service settings. \nA.M. Baabdullah et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \nTechnological Forecasting & Social Change 181 (2022) 121772\n4\n3. Conceptual model \nTo provide an accurate view of the customer experience with chat -\nbots, the conceptual model was based on the flow theory perspective \n( Csikszentmihalyi and LeFevre, 1989 ; Csikszentmihalyi, 1988 ; Csiks -\nzentmihalyi, 1990 ; Koufaris, 2002 ). Based on the technology inter -\nactivity model ( Lee, 2005 ), personalisation, ubiquitous connectivity, \nand responsiveness. Considering the textual nature of chatbot conver -\nsations, other factors (i.e. text language readability and transparency) \nare considered in the current study model (i.e. Bakar and Ameer, 2011 ; \nClerwall, 2014 ; Hooz ´ee et al., 2019 ; Lock and Seele, 2017 ; Nazari et al., \n2017 ; Rauschnabel, 2018 ; Wang et al., 2018 ) ( Fig. 1 ). \n3.1. Flow theory \nIn line with the arguments of Koufaris (2002) ; Csikszentmihalyi and \nLeFevre (1989) ; Csikszentmihalyi (1990) ; Csikszentmihalyi (1988) ; and \nCsikszentmihalyi (1975) , a flow experience refers to a state of complete \ninvolvement in a particular action, and is therefore considered a positive \npsychological state that is intrinsically stimulating, rewarding, and \nentertaining ( Bressler and Bodzin, 2013 ). It is ‘a psychological state in \nwhich the person feels simultaneously cognitively efficient, motivated, \nand happy ’ ( Moneta and Csikszentmihalyi, 1996, p. 277 ). According to \nthe flow theory perspective, customers who have a positive flow expe -\nrience with an interactive digital platform (i.e. chatbots) are more likely \nto be cognitively and emotionally engaged with them, and thus, are \nmore likely to effectively communicate with organisations ( Csikszent -\nmihalyi, 1997 ). \nFlow experience has been proved effective in its applicability and \npredictive validity for studies in the virtual area, as reported by Cooper \n(2010) in his systematic review. Cooper documented that ‘studies indi -\ncate a positive relationship between flow and learning in technology \nenvironments ’ ( 2010, p. 4 ). Hoffman and Novak (2009) and Novak et al. \n(2000) provided empirical evidence supporting the validity of the flow \nexperience over the virtual area. For the purpose of the current study, \ntwo main dimensions are proposed to cover the flow of customer \nexperience with chatbots: concentration and enjoyment, as proposed by \nKoufaris (2002) , Choi et al. (2007) , Chen et al. (2018) , and Wu and Liang \n(2011a, b, c) . \nFlow theory was selected as appropriate for this study based on the \npractical nature of chatbots, which require customers to be fully \nimmersed in their use of such interactive systems. This could be attrib -\nuted to the fact that the expected consequences in the current study (i.e. \ncommunication quality and customer satisfaction) largely rely on the \nextent to which the user is absorbed intensely in the conversation, as \nwell as finds such conversations interesting and enjoyable (i.e. Huang \net al., 2014 ; Lin and Lu, 2011 ; Novak et al., 2000 ). Furthermore, flow \ntheory has been proposed as a theoretical base in many studies ( Bilgihan \net al., 2014 ; Chang, 2013 ; Chen et al., 2018 ; Hradecky et al., 2022 ; \nEsteban-Millat et al., 2014 ; Finneran and Zhang, 2005 ; Huang, 2006 ; \nJung et al., 2016 ; Novak et al., 2000 ; Pelet et al., 2017 ; Wu and Liang, \n2011a, b, c ) that have tested the positive impact of users' experiences \nFig. 1. Conceptual model adapted from Koufaris (2002) ; Csikszentmihalyi and LeFevre (1989) ; Nazari et al. (2017) ; Wang et al. (2018) ; and Lee (2005) .  \nA.M. Baabdullah et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \nTechnological Forecasting & Social Change 181 (2022) 121772\n5\nwith different types of digital platforms and applications (i.e. social \nmedia; mobile TV; online shopping; digital games; online tourism; on -\nline learning) ( Sharma et al., 2022 ) Fig. 1 . \n3.2. Readability \nAccording to Hooz ´ee et al. (2019, p. 572) , text readability can be \ndefined as the extent to which a given text can be read at the optimum \nspeed, fully understood, and found to be interesting. This, in turn, re -\nquires such a text to be explicitly and directly expressed using a limited \nnumber of words ( Hooz ´ee et al., 2019 ). In other words, readable text \nshould avoid ambiguity, bloated jargon, and complex sentence con -\nstructions ( Hooz ´ee et al., 2019 ; Shawar and Atwell, 2005 ). Therefore, if \na chatbot's conversion text has a high level of readability, users are more \nable to fully concentrate on the given text rather than being confused by \ncomplex language. Indeed, the success of chatbots in creating a unique \nand positive flow experience largely depends on the ability of customers \nto effectively read and fully understand the chatbot's reply text ( Sheehan \net al., 2020 ). In this regard, a lack of understanding resulting from poor \nlanguage use and the inability of the user to read the text effectively is \none of the most important concerns that could hinder the success of \nchatbots, as reported recently. Thus, the following hypothesis is \nproposed: \nH1 . . Readability will be positively associated with the customer vir -\ntual flow experience with AI-based chatbots. \n3.3. Transparency \nConceptually, transparency is related to customers' feelings and \nperceptions of honesty and openness in their interaction and commu -\nnication ( Jensen, 2001 ; Hofstede et al., 2004 ; Theuvsen, 2004 ). Hof -\nstede also articulates ‘transparency ’ as ‘the extent to which stakeholders \nhave a shared understanding of, and access to information that they \nrequest, without loss, noise, delay and distortion ’ ( Hofstede, 2003, p. 18 ; \nquoted in Theuvsen, 2004: 125 ). Interaction with chatbots requests \ncustomers to relinquish their privacy and share their personal and sen -\nsitive information ( Kushwaha et al., 2021 ), which could make them \nconcerned regarding their privacy and security ( Kumar and Yakhlef, \n2016 ). In this respect, the extent of chatbots' transparency would miti -\ngate such customers' concerns and facilitate their interaction with \nchatbots. According to Hofstede (2003) and Kumar and Yakhlef (2016) , \nhigh transparency by the sender in the communication process ensures \nconstructive response and interaction from the receiver. Accordingly, it \ncould be argued that customers who perceive chatbots' conversation as \ntransparent are more likely to fully concentrate on their interaction with \nchatbots and find such interaction enjoyable as well. This assumption \nhas recently been proved within the context of B2B by Kushwaha et al. \n(2021) , who supported the positive role of transparency in the business \ncustomer experience with chatbots. Thus, the following hypothesis is \nproposed: \nH2 . . Transparency will be positively associated with customer virtual \nflow experience with AI-based chatbots. \n3.4. Personalization \nAs with other types of AI systems, chatbots have a high level of \npersonalisation capabilities (i.e. natural language) to track customer \nbehaviour and content, which, in turn, leads to the accurate anticipation \nof customers' preferences and needs ( Kunze, 2016 ). Thus, customers are \nmore likely to have a high level of personalised conversation when they \nuse chatbots as a communication channel ( Kunze, 2016 ). For example, \nchatbots can tailor the information and recommendations presented to \ncustomers in the conversation text ( Algharabat et al., 2017 ; Letheren \nand Glavas, 2017 ; Simonofski et al., 2022 ; Zumstein and Hundertmark, \n2017 ). Therefore, personalisation is among the most interactive features \nthat make the customer experience with chatbots unique and attractive \n( Alalwan, 2018 ; Alalwan et al., 2020 ). In other words, the extent of \npersonalisation provided by chatbots would considerably help match \ncustomers' expectations and questions, and accordingly, customers \nwould be more fully concentrated in the chatbots' conversation and find \nit very interesting ( Alalwan et al., 2020 ; Alalwan, 2018 ; Kim and Han, \n2014 ; Shareef et al., 2017 ). In this respect, a recent study conducted by \nStatista (2020) plotting the opinion of customer service agents toward \nchatbots indicated that 64% of those agents think that chatbots will \nlargely help them to provide their customers with a highly personalised \nservice experience, which in turn reflects on their marketing perfor -\nmance and business performance in general. Kim and Han (2014) \nempirically confirmed the impact of personalisation on the flow expe -\nrience by examining digital ads on smartphones. Thus, the following \nhypothesis is proposed: \nH3 . . Personalization will be positively associated with customer vir -\ntual flow experience with AI-based chatbots. \nIt is also worth arguing that personalisation improves the quality of \nthe content provided to customers by tailoring it based on customer \ncapabilities and language preferences ( Topac, 2012 ). This causes cus -\ntomers to more effectively read and fully understand the given text in \nthe chatbot conversation. In contrast, a high level of personalisation in \nchatbots' conversation text reduces the level of customer annoyance and \nsustains the level of readability in chatbots ‘conversations ( Kim and Han, \n2014 ). Rello et al. (2013) also demonstrated that readers are better able \nto access and read the given text if the layout and content of such text are \ncustomised in line with the reader's preferences. Therefore, we would \nargue that a high level of personalisation would accelerate the level of \nreadability in chatbots ’ conversations. Thus, the following hypothesis is \nproposed: \nH4 . . Personalization will be positively associated with the chatbots' \nconversation readability. \nCareful consideration of the definition of responsiveness suggests \nthat customers who have personalised conversations with chatbots are \nmore likely to perceive a high level of responsiveness ( Kim and Han, \n2014 ). For example, the personalised features in chatbots would help \nrespond to customers' questions and enquire relevantly. In turn, this \nenhances the level of responsiveness perceived by chatbots ( Alalwan \net al., 2020 ). In other words, as chatbots' conversation text is closely \nrelated to customers' interests and needs, customers are less likely to see \nsuch conversations as an irritation ( Ducoffe, 1995 ; Kim and Han, 2014 ). \nTherefore, we argue that if chatbots' conversation text is perceived as \ncustomised and personalised based on customer preferences and ex -\npectations, a high level of responsiveness would be perceived by cus -\ntomers in such conversation text. Thus, the following hypothesis is \nproposed: \nH5 . . Personalization will be positively associated with the chatbots' \nresponsiveness. \n3.5. Responsiveness \nResponsiveness is one of the most important interactive features that \nmakes chatbots attractive from the customer's perspective. Conceptu -\nally, responsiveness refers to the ability of chatbots to receive and \nhandle customer requests and questions in an immediate, accurate, \npertinent, and interactive manner ( Alalwan et al., 2020 ; Johnson et al., \n2006 ; Lee, 2005 ; Zhao and Lu, 2012 ). In practice, chatbots can accom -\npany customers across all stages of the shopping journey, starting with \nwelcoming the consumer, presenting available options, answering \nqueries, or providing any service requested by the consumer ( Copulsky, \n2019 ; Forrest and Hoanca, 2015 ; Marinchak et al., 2018 ; Marinchak \net al., 2018 ; Selamat and Windasari, 2021 ; Sotolongo and Copulsky, \n2018 ). Based on algorithms and intelligent systems, chatbots are able to \nA.M. Baabdullah et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \nTechnological Forecasting & Social Change 181 (2022) 121772\n6\nimmediately predict which product and services customers look at and \nsuggest the options that can fit the customers' needs (Forrest and \nHoanca, 2015). Chatbots can also help customers in the actual buying \nstage by guiding them to the main shopping webpage or giving them a \nspecial promotion deal (Luo et al., 2019). Thus, chatbots can provide \ncompanies with more opportunities to actively engage with customers in \nproductive relationships (Alalwan et al., 2020; Følstad et al., 2018). In \nother words, customers who see that chatbots are highly responsive are \nmore likely to fully concentrate on the chatbot's conversation and find it \ninteresting (Zhao and Lu, 2012). This assumption is in line with Yang \nand Lee (2017), who empirically proved the significant impact of \nresponsiveness on the customer's sense of enjoyment in using mobile \nshopping. \nIn light of the above discussion, a high level of responsiveness \nperceived in using chatbots would largely help customers have a positive \nvirtual flow experience while using such an interactive system. Thus, we \npropose the following hypothesis: \nH6. . Responsiveness will be positively associated with customer vir -\ntual flow experience with AI-based chatbots. \n3.6. Ubiquitous connectivity \nUbiquitous connectivity is another important interactive feature of \nchatbots that enables customers to contact the organisation 24/7 and \nfrom any place convenient for them (Lee, 2005). As long as the Internet \nis available, customers who use chatbots enjoy more flexibility and \nfreedom in selecting the time and place where they feel comfortable \nconnecting with their service providers (Alalwan et al., 2020; Gutierrez \net al., 2019; Lee, 2005; Yang and Lee, 2017). Therefore, as Alalwan et al. \n(2020) argue, ubiquitous connectivity is more likely to cognitively and \nemotionally contribute to the customer experience of using chatbots. \nThat is, chatbots enable customers to seamlessly, continuously, and \nsynchronously keep in touch with the organisation. This, in turn, im -\nproves customers' enjoyment and increases concentration in their \ncommunicating with the organisation. Accordingly, we argue that the \nubiquitous connectivity perceived in using chatbots would affect the \ncustomer virtual flow experience with chatbots. Thus, the following \nhypothesis is proposed: \nH7. . Ubiquitous connectivity will be positively associated with the \nchatbots' conversation readability. \n3.7. Flow experience \nDue to their interactive nature, chatbots can facilitate two-way \ncommunication between customers and companies, which in turn re -\nflects on the overall communication quality (Chung et al., 2020). \nTherefore, chatbots have been considered by many business organisa -\ntions for targeted communication with their customers. Chatbots have \ntremendously improved the aspects pertaining to customer contact and \ncommunication (Kushwaha and Kar, 2020; Kushwaha et al., 2021; \nPaikens et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020) and customers are able to have a \nlive and chat and interact with their service providers, and therefore, \nbetter and faster service quality (Mindbrowser, 2017; Xu et al., 2020). \nUsing natural language powered by AI systems makes customer -\n–company communications smarter, as customers can obtain a wide \nrange of information they want or have the help they need at any stage \nof their shopping journey (Luo et al., 2019; Marinchak et al., 2018). In \nother words, the new versions of chatbots can mimic real experiences in \ndialogue with a human being rather than the experience of talking to a \nmachine (i.e. Murtarelli et al., 2021). The dimensions of flow experience \n(enjoyment and concentration) are considered as key facilitators of the \ncustomer–company communication. Therefore, customers with a posi -\ntive flow experience with chatbots are more likely to perceive a high- \nquality communication process. This proposition was empirically sup -\nported by Chen et al. (2008), who tested the positive role of flow \nexperience with an interactive messaging system on communication \nquality and effectiveness. Thus, the following hypothesis is proposed: \nH8. . The virtual flow experience with chatbots will be positively \nassociated with the communication quality. \nCustomer satisfaction is usually determined by the ability of cus -\ntomers to perceive that the targeted actions provide both intrinsic and \nextrinsic utilities, as expected. Therefore, customers who are able to \nfully concentrate on the conversation process with chatbots and who \nfind such interactions more enjoyable are more likely to attain intrinsic \nand extrinsic utilities, and therefore, are more likely to be pleased with \ntheir experience with chatbots (Chen et al., 2018; Cyr and Bonanni, \n2005). In other words, when engaging with chatbot conversations, \ncustomers are able to have more positive flow experiences which leads \nto satisfaction and positive feelings. Wu and Liang (2011a, b, c) \nconfirmed the relationship between flow experiences and customer \nsatisfaction. Chen et al. (2018) also argued that a flow experience could \nenhance a user's ability to learn and thus elicit positive emotions. \nH9. . The virtual flow experience with chatbots will be positively \nassociated with customer satisfaction. \nIf chatbots can enable customers to have better communication \nquality, customers' questions, requests, and expectations are more likely \nto be effectively addressed and matched. This, therefore, reflects posi -\ntively on the customer's overall satisfaction with their interaction with \nchatbots and organisations overall (Chung et al., 2020). Better \ncommunication quality means that business organisations are better \nable to understand, diagnose, and satisfy customers' needs, wants, and \nexpectations (Clokie and Fourie, 2016; Zhao and Rosson, 2009). In \nprevious literature, it has been widely argued that customers are more \nlikely to be satisfied as long as organizational communication channels \n(offline [i.e. salespersons] and online channels [i.e. chatbots]) provide \ncredible, personalised, and in-depth information (Annie Jin, 2012; Jian \net al., 2014; Setia et al., 2013; Yuan et al., 2016). Better communication \nquality would also positively shape customers' attitudes toward chatbots \nas communication channels and business organisation overall (i.e. Annie \nJin, 2012; Chen and Xie, 2008; Mimoun et al., 2017; Yuan et al., 2016). \nThe relationship between communication and customer satisfaction \nwith chatbots has been empirically proven by Chung et al. (2020), who \nreported that aspects of communication quality (accuracy and credi -\nbility) largely enhance the level of customer satisfaction. \nH10. . Chatbots' Communication quality will positively associate with \nthe customer satisfaction. \n4. Methodology \nThe empirical part of the current study was conducted over courier, \npackage delivery, and express mail services in Saudi Arabia. The data \nwere also collected using an online questionnaire survey which was \nposted to a convenience sample of 500 Saudi customers of courier, \npackage delivery, and express mail services over the period extending \nfrom July 2021 to the end of September 2021. As the main focus on the \ncustomers' virtual flow experience with AI-powered chatbots, this study \ntargeted those customers who have already used chatbot systems to \ncomplete the questionnaire. The total number of valid responses \ncaptured in the current study was approximately 361, with a response \nrate of 0.72. In line with what has been suggested by statistical scholars \n(i.e. Kline, 2005; Harris and Schaubroeck, 1990; Hair et al., 1995; Hair \net al., 2006; Gerbing and Anderson (1993), the suitable sample size for \nconducting the structural equation modelling (SEM) analyses should not \nbe less than 200 and not higher than 400. Therefore, the size of the \nextracted sample (361) appears to be suitable for conducting SEM \nanalyses. \nAs presented in the current study's model, eight latent constructs \nwere proposed and measured using scale items derived from prior \nA.M.

Four items were taken from Lock and Seele \n(2017) to measure readability. Transparency was tested using the five \nscale items derived from Lock and Seele (2017) and Hooz ´ee et al. \n(2019) . The scale proposed by Lee (2005) and later validated by Kim and \nKo (2012) and Krishnaraju et al. (2016) was adopted in the current study \nto measure personalisation. Likewise, responsiveness was tested based \non the scale items proposed and validated by Jiang et al. (2010) , \nJohnson et al. (2006) , and Lee (2005) . Four scale items adapted from Lee \n(2005) were used in the current study to test ubiquitous connectivity. \nCommunication quality was tested using a scale proposed by Mohr and \nSpekman (1994) . Satisfaction was tested using scale items extracted \nfrom Anderson and Srinivasan (2003) , Wang et al. (2019) , and Lee and \nChung (2009) . Flow experience was treated in the current study as a \nsecond-order factor comprising two main dimensions: concentration \n(attention focus) and enjoyment which were considered first-order fac -\ntors and tested based on scale items proposed by Chani et al. (1991) . \nThese items were tested using seven-point Likert scale anchors \nranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree. The questionnaire was \ntranslated into Arabic using the back-translation method suggested by \nBrislin (1976) , as Arabic is the native language in Saudi Arabia. Then, \nthe translated version was tested by a number of academic staff at King \nAbdulaziz University to assure an adequate level of validity and to avoid \nany problems in the translation process. \nTo ensure that all scale items were written and readable prior to \nconducting the main survey, a pilot study was conducted with a sample \nof 25 MBA students. The sample size (25) was defined based on the \nsuggestions of Isaac and Michael (1995) and Hill (1998) , who reported \nthat 10 – 30 participants would be adequate to provide estimates for pilot \nstudies in survey-based research. The vast majority of the pilot study \nparticipants reported that the questionnaire was understandable and \nconsumed reasonable time to complete. Further, Cronbach's alpha ( α ) \nwas tested to ensure that all scale items had an extended level of internal \nconsistency (reliability). The lowest Cronbach's alpha ( α ) was about 0.81 \nwhich is higher than the acceptable level of 0.70 ( Nunnally, 1978 ). \n5. Results \n5.1. Demographic characteristics \nAs mentioned in the Methodology section, the data were collected \nfrom a convenience sample of 500 Saudi customers of courier, package \ndelivery, and express mail services who have already used chatbot sys -\ntems. Out of the 500 targeted participants, only 361 fully completed the \nonline questionnaire, with a response rate of 0.72. Approximately 60.1% \nof the participants were male, while 39.9% were female. The age group \nof 25 – 30 years makes up the largest portion of the study sample (31.6%). \nTable 1 also shows that the vast majority of the current study sample had \na monthly income of less than $400. Regarding educational level, most \nof the current study sample participants were well educated, as most of \nthem had a bachelor's degree or higher. About 40.1% of the participants \nin the current study had used chatbots for 2 to 3 years. \n5.2. Structural equation modelling (SEM) \nThe structural equation modelling (SEM) was applied in two stages \nto analyse the data and validate the proposed model. In the first stage, \nconfirmatory factor analysis was conducted to inspect the model's \ngoodness of fit, construct reliability, and validity ( Byrne, 2010 ; Hair \net al., 2010 ; Holmes-Smith et al., 2006 ). The proposed model was then \ntested in the second stage of a structural model ( Anderson and Gerbing, \n1988 ; Byrne, 2010 ; Hair et al., 2010 ). \n5.2.1. Measurement model analyses \nAs seen in Table 2 , some of the fit indices (i.e. CMIN/DF = 3.663; GFI \n= 0.871; AGFI = 0.789, NFI = 0.858) of the first version of the mea -\nsurement model were not within recommended levels ( Byrne, 2010 ; \nHair et al., 1995, 2006 ; Holmes-Smith et al., 2006 ). Therefore, the \nmeasurement model was refined by eliminating the problematic items. \nTherefore, a number of scale items that have factor loadings of less than \n0.50 (TRANS4; ENJ3; UBQS4) or a higher residual value (TRANS5) were \nremoved. The revised version of the measurement model adequately fits \nthe observed data, as all fit indices (i.e. CMIN/DF = 2.301, GFI = 0.922, \nAGFI = 0.885, NFI = 0.944, CFI = 0.973, and RMSEA = 0.045) matched \nrecommended levels ( Hair et al., 2006 ; Hair et al., 2010 ). \nTo attain an adequate level of construct validity and reliability, three \nmeasures [i.e. Cronbach's alpha, composite reliability (CR), and average \nvariance extracted (AVE)] were also tested in the current study ( Fornell \nand Larcker, 1981 ; Hair et al., 2010 ; Anderson and Gerbing, 1988 ; \nTable 1 \nDemographic characteristics.  \nDemographic profile Number of participants (N = 361) Percentage (%) \nGender \nMale  217  60.1 \nFemale  144  39.9 \nTotal  361  100  \nAge \n18 – 24  71  19.7 \n25 – 30  114  31.6 \n31 – 40  86  23.8 \n41 – 50  47  13.0 \n51 – 60  37  10.2 \n60 + 6  1.7 \nTotal  361  100.0  \nMonthly income level (JOD) \nLess than 400  78  21.6 \n400 – 600  55  15.2 \n601 – 800  52  14.4 \n801 – 1000  43  11.9 \n1001 – 1200  19  5.3 \n1201 – 1500  22  6.1 \n1501 – 2000  17  4.7 \n2001 – 2500  30  8.3 \n2501 – 3000  11  3.0 \nMore than 3000  34  9.4 \nTotal  361  100  \nEducation level \nHigh school  14  3.9 \nDiploma  37  10.2 \nBachelor  196  54.3 \nMaster  79  21.9 \nPhD  32  8.9 \nOther  3  0.8 \nTotal  361  100  \nChatbots experience \nLess than one year  86  23.8 \n1 – 2 years  70  19.3 \n2 – 3 years  145  40.1 \nMore than 3 years  60  16.6 \nTotal  361  100  \nTable 2 \nFit indices.  \nFit \nindices \nCut-off \npoint \nFirst version of measurement \nmodel \nRevised measurement \nmodel \nCMIN/ \nDF  \n≤ 3.000  3.663  2.301 \nGFI  ≥ 0.90  0.871  0.922 \nAGFI  ≥ 0.80  0.789  0.885 \nNFI  ≥ 0.90  0.858  0.944 \nCFI  ≥ 0.90  0.942  0.973 \nRMSEA  ≤ 0.08  0.0521  0.045  \nA.M.

All constructs have a Cronbach's alpha ( α ) not less than \n0.70, as suggested by Nunnally (1978) . VR.FLOW had the highest \nCronbach's alpha ( α ) (0.988), while UBQS had the lowest ( α ) (0.811) \n(see Table 3 ). CR values for all constructs were tested and noticed within \ntheir suggested level of not less than 0.70 ( Fornell and Larcker, 1981 ; \nHair et al., 2010 ). Similar to the Cronbach's alpha ( α ), the highest CR \nvalue (0.987) was observed for VR.FLOW, while the lowest was for \nUBQS (0.808) (see Table 3 ). The AVE values for all constructs matched \ntheir threshold levels, with values not less than 0.50. Once again, VR. \nFLOW showed the largest AVE (0.974), whereas RESPV had the smallest \n(0.579) ( Hair et al., 2010 ) (see Table 3 ). \nConstruct validity was also tested by inspecting two common \ncriteria: convergent and discriminant validity ( Anderson and Gerbing, \n1988 ; Hair et al., 2010 ). After refining the measurement model, stan -\ndardized regression weight values (factor loading) of more than 0.50 \nwere obtained for all other scale items, with a significant p value of not \nhigher than 0.0001 ( Anderson and Gerbing, 1988 ; Hair et al., 2010 ) (see \nTable 3 ). As seen in Table 4 , all constructs match the discriminant val -\nidity standard, as the inter-correlation values between constructs are less \nthan the square root of AVE captured by each construct ( Kline, 2005 ). \n5.2.2. Structural model analyses \nThe results of the structural model largely support the predictive \nvalidity and goodness of fit of the proposed model. For example, the \nyielded fit indices of the structural model were found to be within their \nsuggested levels (i.e. CMIN/DF = 2.363, GFI = 0.921, AGFI = 0.883, \nNFI = 0.942, CFI = 0.969, and RMSEA = 0.048). The conceptual model \nwas also able to predict approximately 0.60, 0.56, 0.47, and 0.41 of \nvariance in VR.FLOW, COMQ, SATIS, and READ, respectively. All the \nVR.FLOW drivers were also supported and found to be significant. READ \nwas the most significant factor predicting VR.FLOW ( γ = 0.355, p <\n0.000), followed by PRS ( γ = 0.228; p < 0.000) and TRANS ( γ = 0.163, p \n< 0.000). The UBQS significantly predicted VR.FLOW ( γ = 0.163, p <\n0.004) ( Fig. 2 ). RSPV had the lowest but still significant impact on VR. \nFLOW ( γ = 0.147, p < 0.000). As proposed, the PRS strongly predicted \nboth READ ( γ = 0.599, p < 0.000) and PRS ( γ = 0.339, p < 0.000). VR. \nFLOW proved to have a significant impact on both COMQ ( γ = 0.599, p \n< 0.000) and SATIS ( γ = 0.449, p < 0.000) ( Fig. 2 ). Finally, a strong and \nsignificant causal relationship was found between COMQ and SATIS \nscores ( γ = 0.454, p < 0.000) (see Table 5 ). \n6. Discussion \nThe results presented in the previous section largely support the \npredictive validity of the current study's model. In particular, five factors \n(i.e. READ, PRS, UBQS, RSPV, and TRANS) were able to predict \napproximately 0.60 of the variance in VR.FLOW. About 0.56 of the \nvariance was accounted for in COMQ. Both VR.FLOW and COMQ pre -\ndicted approximately 0.47 of the variance in SATIS. Further, the fit \nindices yielded in the structural model largely support the current \nstudy's goodness of fit to the observed data. This supports the selection of \nflow theory as a suitable theoretical foundation to explain customers' \nexperiences and interactions with AI-chatbots. Despite the parsimony of \nthe current model, all research hypotheses are strongly supported (see \nTable 5 ), which thus support the suitability of these factors within the \ncontext of AI-chatbots as well ( Mahmud et al., 2022 ; Viola et al., 2021 ). \nAs discussed above, all antecedences of VR.FLOW were significantly \nconfirmed according to path coefficient analyses. As shown in Table 5 , \nreadability was the strongest predictor of VR.FLOW. This means that as \nlong as customers see Chatbot conversation text clearly written and \npresented in a more understandable way, they are more likely to fully \nconcentrate on and enjoy their interaction with AI-chatbots. In other \nwords, customers who perceive a high level of readability have a posi -\ntive flow experience with chatbots. This could be reflected in the ability \nof chatbots to use natural language which fits the customer's native \nlanguage and culture ( Shawar and Atwell, 2005, p. 29 ). These results are \nsimilar to those reported by Hooz ´ee et al. (2019) , Gupta et al. (2021) , \nKar and Kushwaha (2021) , and Shawar and Atwell (2005) . These studies \nextensively argued the role of readability of the content given in shaping \ncustomer understanding, and accordingly, to the extent to which the \ncustomer would adopt and be affected by such content. \nAspects related to transparency in chatbot conversations also \nreceived considerable attention from the participants of the current \nstudy sample. In other words, customers are more likely to fully \nconcentrate and enjoy interacting with chatbot conversations if they see \na high level of transparency in such interactions. As argued in the con -\nceptual model, customers are requested to provide more personal and \nsensitive information during their conversations with chatbots. There -\nfore, transparency is a fundamental condition that guarantees that \ncustomers will openly and freely interact with chatbots and more op -\nportunities to have a positive flow experience ( Alalwan et al., 2016 ; \nKushwaha et al., 2021 ; Jensen, 2001 ; Hofstede et al., 2004 ; Selamat and \nWindasari, 2021 ; Theuvsen, 2004 ; Jin and Youn, 2021 ). These results \nare close to those reported by Kushwaha et al. (2021) , who proved the \nsignificant impact of transparency in the business customer experience \nwith chatbots. \nIn line with what has been proposed in the conceptual model, per -\nsonalisation was the second-strongest factor predicting VR.FLOW. This \nresult indicates that a high level of personalisation motivates customers \nto focus attention and enjoy their interaction with Chatbot conversa -\ntions. As with other types of AI applications, chatbots are able to keep \ntrack of customers' activities, content, and information, which creates an \nopportunity to accurately predict what they need and want ( Jim ´enez- \nBarreto et al., 2021 ; Kunze, 2016 ). These results are similar to those of \nKim and Han (2014) , who empirically validated the significant impact of \npersonalisation on customer flow experience within the smartphone \ncontext. \nTable 3 \nConstructs reliability and validity.  \nItem  Latent construct Estimate ( α ) CR AVE \nCONRT ← VR.FLOW  0.991  0.988  0.987  0.974 \nENJ ← VR.FLOW  0.967 \nRSPV1 ← RSPV  0.788  0.836  0.833  0.579 \nRSPV2 ← RSPV  0.913 \nRSPV3 ← RSPV  0.866 \nRSPV4 ← RSPV  0.334 \nREAD1 ← READ  0.955  0.908  0.905  0.732 \nREAD2 ← READ  0.991 \nREAD3 ← READ  0.979 \nREAD4 ← READ  0.276 \nSATIS1 ← SATIS  0.875  0.854  0.852  0.610 \nSATIS2 ← SATIS  0.905 \nSATIS3 ← SATIS  0.848 \nSATIS4 ← SATIS  0.371 \nCONRT1 ← CONRT  0.795  0.948  0.949  0.823 \nCONRT2 ← CONRT  0.881 \nCONRT3 ← CONRT  0.954 \nCONRT4 ← CONRT  0.987 \nENJ1 ← ENJ  0.788  0.912  0.913  0.779 \nENJ2 ← ENJ  0.869 \nENJ3 ← ENJ  0.980 \nCOMQ1 ← COM  0.812  0.939  0.935  0.705 \nCOMQ2 ← COM  0.894 \nCOMQ3 ← COM  0.865 \nCOMQ4 ← COM  0.787 \nCOMQ5 ← COM  0.854 \nPRS1 ← PRS  0.792  0.876  0.870  0.630 \nPRS2 ← PRS  0.886 \nPRS3 ← PRS  0.837 \nPRS4 ← PRS  0.638 \nTRANS1 ← TRANS  0.856  0.915  0.919  0.792 \nTRANS2 ← TRANS  0.913 \nTRANS3 ← TRANS  0.899 \nUBQS1 ← UBQS  0.814  0.811  0.808  0.585 \nUBQS2 ← UBQS  0.765 \nUBQS3 ← UBQS  0.712  \nA.M.

This assumption was supported in the \ncurrent study by a positive and significant relationship between per -\nsonalisation and readability. These results are similar to those reported \nby Topac (2012) , Ngai et al. (2021) , Kim and Han (2014) , and Rello et al. \n(2013) , who argued that customers are better able to successfully read \nand fully understand the given text in the chatbots conversation if the \ntext is tailored to the customer's language preferences and skills. Simi -\nlarly, a positive and strong causal relationship was found between per -\nsonalisation and responsiveness. A high level of personalisation makes \nchatbots more able to match customers' requirements and expectations, \nand accordingly, a higher responsiveness that customers could perceive \nin their interaction with such interactive systems ( Kim and Han, 2014 ). \nFor instance, customers are able to obtain more relevant answers and \nTable 4 \nDiscriminant validity.   \nREAD COM VR.FLOW TRANS PRS SATIS UBQS RSPV \nREAD  0.856        \nCOMQ  0.598  0.840       \nVR.FLOW  0.736  0.707  0.987      \nTRANS  0.503  0.740  0.591  0.890     \nPRS  0.422  0.518  0.556  0.501  0.794    \nSATIS  0.720  0.723  0.705  0.620  0.411  0.781   \nUBQS  0.352  0.470  0.497  0.491  0.541  0.368  0.765  \nRSPV  0.636  0.570  0.585  0.445  0.236  0.611  0.290 0.761  \nFig. 2.

This \nmeans that those customers who perceive that chatbots can respond to \ntheir questions and enquire effectively will largely consciously concen -\ntrate on the chatbots conversation and enjoy such interactions. \nResponsiveness could be attributed to the interactive capabilities of AI- \nenabled chatbot systems that could comprehensively, accurately, and \nrelevantly predict and address customers' questions and enquirers. \nThese results are close to those of Alalwan et al. (2020) , who proved the \nsignificant role of responsiveness in customers' cognitive and emotional \nengagement with mobile shopping. Other studies (i.e. Yang and Lee, \n2017 ; Zhao and Lu, 2012 ) have validated role responsiveness and have \nreached the same conclusions as in the current study in this regard. \nPath coefficient analyses supported the significant role of ubiquitous \nconnectivity in enhancing VR.FLOW. Considerations related to time and \nplace are among the most important determinants that may hinder or \nfacilitate consumer interactions with service providers. In this respect, \nchatbots help customers freely and flexibly identify when and where \nthey interact with the service ( Alalwan et al., 2020 ; Lee, 2005 ; Yang and \nLee, 2017 ). This, in turn, gives customers more opportunities to \nconcentrate on and enjoy their interactions via chatbot channels. \nAccording to the structural model results, VR.FLOW presents a sig -\nnificant level for both communication quality and customer satisfaction. \nThis means that customers who were successfully able to have a positive \nflow experience with AI- chatbots are more likely to be pleased about \ntheir interaction with such systems and their service providers overall. \nThe core success of the flow experience largely relies on the ability to \nhelp customers focus mentally and enjoy their interaction and commu -\nnication with chatbots ( Chen et al., 2018 ; Cyr and Bonanni, 2005 ). \nAccordingly, customers who have a positive flow experience are more \nlikely to obtain both intrinsic and extrinsic utilities, which accelerates \ntheir satisfaction. Further, a successful flow experience with chatbots \nwould empower customers to clearly express their needs and expecta -\ntions, and thus increase the organisation's ability to understand these \nneeds and meet them in the best way, which enhances the chances of \nconsumer satisfaction. Various works ( Chen et al., 2018 ; Cyr and \nBonanni, 2005 ; Hsu et al., 2019 ; Wu and Liang, 2011a, b, c ) have sup -\nported the relationship between flow experience and customer \nsatisfaction. \nCustomer satisfaction is usually determined by the ability of cus -\ntomers to perceive that the targeted actions provide both intrinsic and \nextrinsic utilities, as expected. Therefore, customers who are able to \nfully concentrate on the conversation process with chatbots and find \nsuch interactions more enjoyable are more likely to attain intrinsic and \nextrinsic utilities, and therefore, are more pleased regarding their \nexperience with chatbots ( Chen et al., 2018 ; Cyr and Bonanni, 2005 ; \nOvak et al., 2000 ). In other words, when engaging with chatbot con -\nversations, customers are more able to have positive flow experiences \nwhich leads to satisfaction and positive feelings. Wu and Liang (2011a, \nb, c) confirmed the relationship between flow experiences and customer \nsatisfaction. Chen et al. (2018) also argued that in mobile shopping, a \nflow experience could enhance a user's ability to learn and thus elicit \npositive emotions. \nThe results also indicated that customers who have a positive flow \nexperience will likely have a positive perception of communication \nquality with chatbots. In fact, the vast majority of our study sample had a \npositive perception of the quality of communication with chatbots, as \nthe average mean of the communication quality scale items was about \n5.86. Such results could be attributed to the interactive nature of chat -\nbots, which allows customers to have more responsive and synchronous \ncommunication with their service providers ( Chung et al., 2020 ; Kush -\nwaha and Kar, 2020 ; Kushwaha et al., 2021 ; Paikens et al., 2020 ; Xu \net al., 2020 ). A high level of communication quality means that \ncustomers' enquiries and questions are better received and understood \nand, accordingly, better satisfied by service providers. As argued in the \nconceptual model section, AI-chatbots largely use natural language that \nmakes company – customer communicate smarter. Furthermore, AI- \nchatbots can help customers over all stages of their shopping journey \nand provide suitable assistance and support whenever needed ( Luo \net al., 2019 ; Marinchak et al., 2018 ). \n6.1. Theoretical implications \nIn line with the discussion in Sections 1 and 2 , this study identified a \nlack of understanding regarding the aspects that could shape customers' \nvirtual experience with AI-chatbots. This could be attributed to the fact \nthat the majority of prior chatbots studies have fully focused on the \ncustomers' intention, adoption, and satisfaction toward such systems, \nwhile customers' virtual flow experience has not been well covered in \nthe relevant area of chatbots ( Brandtzaeg and F ø lstad, 2017 ; Adam et al., \n2021 ; Zarouali et al., 2018 ; Zumstein and Hundertmark, 2017 ). There -\nfore, this study makes a considerable contribution by focusing more on \nthe customers' virtual flow experience with chatbots, which opens new \nhorizons for researchers and practitioners to consider dimensions other \nthan satisfaction and intention to use to facilitate and accelerate the pace \nof success of Chabot applications. In fact, the selection of the customer's \nvirtual flow experience as a core construct in the current study's model \nwas not random but rather based on the fact that the success of the \nchatbot system relies heavily on consumer concentration/attention \nfocus and his or her sense of enjoyment while interacting with such a \nsystem. \nIt is also important to note that aspects related to conversation lan -\nguage and readability have not been fully covered by prior studies on \nchatbots, which thus require further analyses. Accordingly, an impor -\ntant contribution of the current study is that it sheds light on the role of \nreadability as a key driver of customers' virtual experience with chat -\nbots. Due to the particular nature of customer chatbot interactions \nwhich largely take place through conversation texts, issues related to \nconversation language and readability are crucial in shaping the cus -\ntomer's virtual flow experience with chatbots. The relationship between \ntransparency and customers' flow experience has not received adequate \ninterest in the prior literature on chatbots. Thus, this study adds value by \nidentifying on the significant role of transparency in shaping a unique \nconsumer experience with chatbots. \nAnother contribution of the current study is related to the role of the \ninteractive features of chatbots (i.e. personalisation, responsiveness, and \nubiquitous connectivity). These features have rarely been covered in the \nrelated studies on chatbots. There is also a lack of understanding of the \nimpact of these features on the customer virtual flow experience. \nTherefore, by considering these three interactive features (i.e. person -\nalisation, responsiveness, and ubiquitous connectivity), the current \nstudy provides a clear vision of the most important factors that should be \nconsidered in shaping a unique consumer experience with chatbots. \nFurthermore, this study contributes by validating the impact of per -\nsonalisation on readability. Such a relationship between personalisation \nand readability has not been empirically validated in the literature on \ninformation systems in general and chatbots in particular. \nAs discussed in Section 2.5 , the majority of chatbots studies were \nconducted over different sectors (i.e. retail, hotels, luxury brands, SMEs, \nbanking, advertising, online shopping, and healthcare) ( Chung et al., \n2020 ; Jim ´enez-Barreto et al., 2021 ; Hoffman and Nadelson, 2010 ; \nKasilingam, 2020 ; Kushwaha et al., 2021 ; Rese et al., 2020 ; Selamat and \nWindasari, 2021 ; Sheehan et al., 2020 ; Trivedi, 2019 ). However, no \nstudy has addressed the related issues of customer virtual flow experi -\nence with chatbots in the courier services sector. This is despite the \nimportance of considering the implications and contributions of chat -\nbots in the courier, package delivery, and express mail service setting. In \nthis context, the overall success of the service delivery process depends \non the quality and efficiency of the communication process between the \nA.M. Baabdullah et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \nTechnological Forecasting & Social Change 181 (2022) 121772\n11\nconsumer and providers of such services. Therefore, this study has gone \nbeyond just examining the customer flow experience with chatbots to \ntest the level of communication quality between customers and service \nproviders using chatbot channels. In turn, the current study expands the \nimplications of the use of chatbots in a new setting (courier, package \ndelivery, and express mail service) and theoretically by validating the \nrole of new aspects (customers' virtual flow experience and communi -\ncation quality). \nWe also make a methodological contribution by conducting the \nempirical portion of the study in both a new setting (courier, package \ndelivery, and express mail service) and a new country (Saudi Arabia). In \ndetail, this study was able to develop a date instrument according to \nwell-established scale measurements from previous studies, and then the \nderived measurement items were adapted to the Chatbot context and \ntranslated using the back-translation method suggested by (Brislin, \n1976) to be suitable for the Saudi customer setting. Furthermore, the \nstatistical results of the measurement model largely supported the val -\nidity and reliability of the current study's data instrument, which makes \nit effective and accurate for use by Saudi or Arab researchers, especially \ngiven the scarcity of research in the field of AI and chatbots worldwide. \n6.2. Practical implications \nThe empirical results of the current study have yielded various im -\nplications that could help marketers, system developers, and practi -\ntioners improve chatbot design to guarantee a positive customer flow \nexperience. For example, the significant impact of readability gives clues \nabout paying more attention to aspects related to the quality of the \nlanguage used in chatbots conversation text. Thus, all responses and \ninformation posted by chatbots should be easy to read and friendly. In \nthis respect, it is necessary to use linguists to check the quality and ease \nof the language used, and to avoid spelling or grammatical errors. The \nlanguage used in chatbot conversations should also consider individual \ndifferences in reading and comprehension skills. Using natural language \nin the chatbots conversation text could also give a sense of human \ninteraction and, accordingly, reflect the level of readability (Bargas- \nAvila and Brühlmann, 2016). It is also highly recommended to consider \ncustomers' language preferences by presenting the chatbots' conversa -\ntion text in multiple languages (Baabdullah et al., 2019; Liu, 2003). \nAccording to the current study's results, the ability of chatbots to \ncreate a positive flow experience pertains to the level of transparency \nperceived in the chatbot conversation. Various aspects should be \nconsidered in this regard, such as chatbots' ability to always provide \naccurate and correct responses to customers' enquiries and questions. \nCompanies should also promote virtual channels such as chatbots to \nconsumers as a more convenient interact method; therefore, companies \nshould clearly express their genuine intentions from using such channels \nto help customers. The customer also has a comprehensive under -\nstanding of the mechanism by which the chatbot works, which enhances \nthe extent of his confidence and, thus, the extent of the perceived \ntransparency in this regard. Therefore, the organisation should be open \nto all the details related to the use of chatbots and how to collect \ncustomer information and how to use it in a way that makes the \ncustomer feel more comfortable and reassured (Kumar and Yakhlef, \n2016). \nMore attention should also be paid to the interactive features of \nchatbots, especially those related to personalisation and responsiveness. \nIn this respect, customers who actively use chatbots should be motivated \nto disclose their personal data and preferences, which will be used later \nto tailor solutions for customers' problems and answers to their queries \nbased on their preferences and personal profiles. In this respect, system \ndevelopers and marketers' efforts should stress the level of privacy and \nsecurity in maintaining and processing such information to allow cus -\ntomers to feel safer and more comfortable in disclosing such informa -\ntion. Further, by using the personalised capabilities embedded in AI \napplications in general and chatbots in particular (i.e. pre-programmed \nchat, cookies, natural language), service providers can tailor their con -\nversations and interactions with their targeted customers (Kunze, 2016; \nZarouali et al., 2018; Zumstein and Hundertmark, 2017). \nEnhancing the level of responsiveness would considerably help form \na positive flow experience with chatbots. Therefore, more effort should \nbe made to improve the mechanism by which chatbots receive and \naddress customers' questions and enquire in a more relevant manner. \nChatbot features should also facilitate bidirectional communication \nbetween customers and service providers. In other words, chatbots \nshould enjoy a high level of interactivity that allows both customers and \nservice providers' two-way communication without any restrictions. \nThis, in turn, would help immediately address all consumer enquiries \nand questions. Such responses and information should accurately and \nclosely match customer needs and expectations. Therefore, the content \nstored in chatbots must be reviewed periodically and developed in line \nwith consumer requirements and needs. Even though chatbots seem to \nbe more automated customer service centres, there is still a need to have \na human service support centre to deal with any dilemma that chatbots \nmay be unable to deal with, especially in the early stages of providing \nchatbot services (Alalwan et al., 2020). \nThe results confirmed the important role of ubiquitous connectivity \nin shaping the customer flow experience with chatbots. Therefore, \nfurther research should be conducted to enhance aspects pertaining to \nubiquitous connectivity. For example, chatbot designers should work \nmore on the level of adaptability and flexibility of using chatbots using \ndifferent platforms (e.g. smartphones, personal computers, tablets) or \ninternet browsers (Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Sa -\nfari) (Alalwan et al., 2020). This in turn empowers customers to access \nchatbots whenever and wherever they need. Furthermore, chatbot ser -\nvice providers should guarantee the sustainability of such channels \nwithout disconnection or downtime, and accordingly, continuous \nmaintenance and improvement of chatbot channels is highly \nrecommended. \n6.3. Limitations and future research directions \nThis study represents a worthwhile attempt to test the impact of \nvirtual agents (i.e. AI-powered chatbots) on customers' virtual experi -\nence. However, several areas could not be fully addressed, which would \nbe worth considering in future research. This study tested the related \nissues of AI-powered chatbots from the customer perspective, but does \nnot sufficiently cover the service providers. Therefore, future studies \nshould concentrate more on the aspects related to the service provider \nperspective to build a comprehensive picture covering the main factors \ngoverning the success of such applications. Further, this study examines \nthe main enablers of customers' virtual flow experience with chatbots; \nyet, it has not tested the key inhibitors (i.e. need for human interaction; \nperceived risk; technology anxiety; privacy and security concerns). \nTherefore, future studies should consider the use of such inhibitors. \nPersonal factors (i.e. technology readiness, self-efficacy, attitudes) and \ndemographic factors (i.e. age, gender, income level, and educational \nlevel) were likewise considered and validated in the current study \nmodel. Therefore, these factors must be subject to careful study and \nanalysis in future research to provide a clear and comprehensive \nexplanation of the consumer's experience with chatbots. Further, the \nstudy's participants were actual users of chatbots; however, there is still \na need to consider the perspective of non-users of chatbots to know how \nthey could be motivated to experience chatbots. Finally, this study was \nconducted in Saudi Arabia and did not account for the role of cultural \nfactors (collectivism and individualism). Hence, future studies could \nconsider the related issues of chatbots across different countries, \nconsidering the impact of cultural dimensions such as collectivism and \nindividualism. \nA.M.

Conclusion \nCustomer service areas have improved tremendously, especially in \naspects pertaining to customer contact and communication. In using \nmore updated and smart interfaces (i.e. virtual agents and chatbots), \ncustomers are able to have live chat and interactions with their service \nproviders, and therefore, better and faster service quality. In fact, virtual \nagents (i.e. chatbots) have increasingly replaced the role of humans and \ntraditional methods of customer service. Using natural language pow -\nered by artificial intelligence (AI) systems has made customer – company \nconversations smarter, as customers can obtain a wide range of infor -\nmation they want or have the help they need. However, based on a \ncareful review of the main body of literature on chatbots, we noticed \nthat there is still a lack of understanding regarding certain aspects that \ncould shape customers' virtual experience in such applications. In \naddition, there is a need to see how such virtual agents (i.e. chatbots) \ncould accelerate communication quality with the targeted customer. \nAspects related to conversation language and readability were also \nidentified to require testing as these have not been fully covered by prior \nchatbot studies. To provide an accurate view of the customer experience \nwith chatbots, the conceptual model was based on the flow theory \nperspective ( Csikszentmihalyi and LeFevre, 1989 ; Csikszentmihalyi, \n1988 ; Csikszentmihalyi, 1990 ; Koufaris, 2002 ). Specifically, two main \ndimensions of the flow customer's experience, concentration and \nenjoyment, are proposed in the current study model. Based on the \ntechnology interactivity model ( Lee, 2005 ), the factors of personaliza -\ntion, ubiquitous connectivity, and responsiveness were also considered \nin the study's model. Taking into account the textual nature of chatbot \nconversations, other factors (i.e. text language readability and trans -\nparency) are proposed as key drivers of a customer's virtual flow expe -\nrience. Due to its sensitive nature and the lack of sufficient studies in this \nsector, this study has conducted an empirical analysis of courier, pack -\nage delivery, and express mail service setting. The data were collected \nusing a questionnaire survey administered to customers who actively \nuse chatbot channels. The collected data were then tested using the SEM \nmethod, and the results largely supported the role of readability, \ntransparency, responsiveness, personalisation, and ubiquitous connec -\ntivity in predicting customers' virtual flow experiences with chatbots. \nThe empirical results also support the impact of customers' virtual flow \nexperiences with chatbots on both communication quality and \nsatisfaction. \nCRediT authorship contribution statement \nAbdullah M.
