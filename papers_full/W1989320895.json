    "abstract": "This paper presents research on the voltage and current distortion in the input stage, isolation stage and output stage of Distribution Electronic Power transformer (D-EPT) after the open-circuit and short-circuit faults of its power switches. In this paper, the operational principles and the control methods for input stage, isolation stage and output stage of D-EPT, which work as a cascaded H-bridge rectifier, DC-DC converter and inverter, respectively, are introduced. Based on conclusions derived from the performance analysis of D-EPT after the faults, this paper comes up with the effects from its topology design and control scheme on the current and voltage distortion. According to the EPT fault characteristics, since the waveforms of relevant components heavily depend on the location of the faulty switch, it is very easy to locate the exact position of the faulty switch. Finally, the fault characteristics peculiar to D-EPT are analyzed, and further discussed with simulation on the Saber platform, as well as a fault location diagnosis algorithm.",
