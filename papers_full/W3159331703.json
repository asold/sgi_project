    "abstract": "Calculation of power system transients involving transformers require models that incorporate capacitive \\nbehavior. The paper outlines how classical low-frequency transformer models can be extended with capacitances \\nand how to fit the parameters based on typical values, test report and frequency response measurements. \\nJustified tuning factors are proposed. The responses of the models are compared to measurements in frequency \\ndomain, and with detailed black-box models in studies of transient recovery voltage and lightning. The models \\nshow reasonable agreement including the first resonance point, but with too low damping without proper \\nadjustments.",
