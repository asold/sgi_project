Little research, however, has examined the effect of patients using eHealth tools to self-report their medication\nmanagement and use. Similarly, there is little evidence showing how eHealth tools might prompt patients and health care providers\nto make appropriate changes to medication use.\nObjective: The objective of this systematic review was to determine the impact of patients’ use of eHealth tools on self-reporting\nadverse effects and symptoms that promote changes to medication use. Related secondary outcomes were also evaluated.\nMethods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL were searched from January 1, 2000, to April 25, 2018. Reference lists of\nrelevant systematic reviews and included articles from the literature search were also screened to identify relevant studies. Title,\nabstract, and full-text review as well as data extraction and risk of bias assessment were performed independently by 2 reviewers.\nDue to high heterogeneity, results were not meta-analyzed and instead presented as a narrative synthesis.\nResults: A total of 14 studies, including 13 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 1 open-label intervention, were included,\nfrom which 11 unique eHealth tools were identified. In addition, 14 RCTs found statistically significant increases in positive\nmedication changes as a result of using eHealth tools, as did the single open-label study. Moreover, 8 RCTs found improvement\nin patient symptoms following eHealth tool use, especially in adolescent asthma patients. Furthermore, 3 RCTs showed that\neHealth tools might improve patient self-efficacy and self-management of chronic disease. Little or no evidence was found to\nsupport the effectiveness of eHealth tools at improving medication recommendations and reconciliation by clinicians, medication-use\nbehavior, health service utilization, adverse effects, quality of life, or patient satisfaction. eHealth tools with multifaceted\nfunctionalities and those allowing direct patient-provider communication may be more effective at improving patient\nself-management and self-efficacy.\nConclusions: Evidence suggests that the use of eHealth tools may improve patient symptoms and lead to medication changes.\nPatients generally found eHealth tools useful in improving communication with health care providers. Moreover, health-related\noutcomes among frequent eHealth tool users improved in comparison with individuals who did not use eHealth tools frequently.\nJ Med Internet Res 2018 | vol. 20 | iss. 12 | e294 | p. 1https://www.jmir.org/2018/12/e294/\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nLancaster et alJOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH\nXSL•FO\nRenderX\nImplementation issues such as poor patient engagement and poor clinician workflow integration were identified.

The World Bank reports that almost 44% of people across\nthe globe used the internet in 2015, compared with 0.25% in\n1993 [1]. This number is expected to increase to over 50% by\n2019 [2]. Nearly two-thirds of internet users are estimated to\naccess health information on the Web [3]. With such demand\nfor accessible health information, electronic health (eHealth)\nhas become a popular way to provide patients with health\ninformation, recommendations to self-manage their health, and\naccess to their health records and data [3,4]. eHealth is defined\nas “an overarching term used today to describe the application\nof information and communications technologies in the health\nsector. It encompasses a whole range of purposes from purely\nadministrative through to health care delivery” [5]. eHealth\ntools, therefore, are technologies that may include electronic\nmedical records (EMRs), personal health records (PHRs), mobile\napps, patient portals, information repositories, and many other\ninternet-based programs or software used to help patients\nmonitor and manage their health. eHealth tools may help\ndecrease fragmentation of care by compiling patient health\ninformation from multiple providers into 1 easily accessible\nlocation [6], while also streamlining patient-provider\ncommunication and promoting shared decision making [3,4].\nWell-functioning eHealth tools can help patients better\nunderstand their health [7] and may lead to improvements in\npatient-physician relationships [8]. eHealth tools can encourage\npatients to play a larger role in shared decision making and\nmight increase focus on self-management and preventative care\n[8,9]. As technology advances, the use of eHealth tools can\nprovide a level of convenience for both patients and providers\n[10]. These tools can generally be accessed from any\ninternet-capable device and often provide a method of\nasynchronous communication such as emails and short message\nservice (SMS) text messaging. These methods allow patients\nand providers to ask and answer questions at their convenience,\ncreating less of a burden on physician workflow [8].\nThe ability of patients to use eHealth tools to better manage\nmedication by reporting feedback on symptoms and use of\nmedications directly to health care providers has not been\ncomprehensively explored in the literature. Similarly, there is\nlittle evidence showing how eHealth tools might provide\nprompts to patients and health care providers to make\nappropriate changes to medication use based on this feedback.\nA synthesis of this literature will provide greater understanding\nof what eHealth tool design features may be helpful in patient\nreporting of medication-related experiences and outcomes.\nObjective\nThe objective of this systematic review was to determine the\nimpact of patients’use of eHealth tools on self-reporting adverse\neffects and symptoms that promote changes to medication use.\nThe PICO model was used to focus the objective of the review,\nas seen in Figure 1.\nJ Med Internet Res 2018 | vol. 20 | iss. 12 | e294 | p. 2https://www.jmir.org/2018/12/e294/\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nLancaster et alJOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH\nXSL•FO\nRenderX\nFigure 1. Use of the PICO model in this systematic review. eHealth: electronic health.\nMethods\nStudy Design and Study Selection\nThis systematic review was performed following steps outlined\nby Cochrane’s Effective Practice and Organization of Care\ngroup and reported based on the Preferred Reporting Items for\nSystematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement [11]. A total\nof 3 biomedical and health science databases were searched:\nMEDLINE/Ovid, EMBASE/Ovid, and CINAHL. References\nof all included articles were also searched. All 3 databases were\nsearched from January 1, 2000, to April 25, 2018. The search\nwas limited to articles published in English using terms\nrepresenting eHealth (eg, Web-based applications), symptoms\nand adverse drug reaction reporting (eg, drug-related adverse\neffects and adverse reactions), and patient self-monitoring (eg,\nself-management; see Multimedia Appendix 1 for full search\nstrategy and Multimedia Appendix 2 [12-17] for definitions for\nterminology used). The search date began from 2000, which\ngenerally marks the start of scientific reporting of eHealth\ninterventions that would have relevance to the current use of\neHealth tools. As a result of the aforementioned search strategy,\nstudies were included in this review if they determined the\neffectiveness and impact of changes to medication regimens as\na result of using eHealth tools. As such, this review investigated\nthese effects using a comparative quantitative methodological\napproach.\nCriteria for Inclusion of Studies\nFor the purposes of this review, an eHealth tool was considered\nto be any internet-based intervention, including mobile health\napps, used by patients for clinical purposes that focused on\nimproving patient health and clinical outcomes. The term PHR\nrefers to an eHealth tool wherein a patient has access to and can\nenter or edit their own health data. The population investigated\nwas community-dwelling individuals of any age in an outpatient\nsetting.\nFor a study to be included, the eHealth tool must have allowed\npatients (or caregivers) to enter information directly (as opposed\nto information being entered by a health care provider); included\nself-reporting functionalities focusing on medication monitoring,\ncontain a medication monitoring or use component, or\nspecifically incorporating the option for the patient or caregiver\nto enter symptoms including adverse effects; and needed to\nfocus specifically on medication use, clinical outcomes, or\nJ Med Internet Res 2018 | vol. 20 | iss. 12 | e294 | p. 3https://www.jmir.org/2018/12/e294/\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nLancaster et alJOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH\nXSL•FO\nRenderX\nsymptom reporting following use of the eHealth tool. Any\neHealth tools involving changes in medication reconciliation\nand recommendations made to changes in drug therapy were\nalso included.\nExclusion criteria were conference abstracts; qualitative studies;\narticles without a comparator group; articles that did not report\non at least one medication-related outcome; articles where\nself-management strategies focused on lifestyle modification,\nbehavioral interventions, or nondrug interventions; articles\nfocused solely on the validation of an eHealth tool; articles\nfocused on methodological or technical aspects of eHealth\ninterventions; articles containing nonempirical information;\narticles that synthesized information about multiple eHealth\ntools in an article (ie, review articles); and eHealth tools used\nby regulatory agencies to report adverse drug events (ADEs).\nArticle Selection\nAll potentially relevant articles were uploaded into DistillerSR\nsoftware, which was used throughout the selection process.\nPotentially relevant articles underwent title, abstract, and\nfull-text review. Articles that met inclusion criteria proceeded\nto data abstraction and risk of bias assessment. Articles not\nmeeting inclusion criteria were excluded at both levels. Figure\n2 represents the flow of articles through the selection process.\nTitle and abstract review were performed independently by 2\nreviewers from a pool of 5 reviewers. Of these, 1 reviewer went\nthrough the reference lists of all the articles included in this\nstudy. Another reviewer went through reference lists of relevant\nsystematic reviews identified during the literature search.\nPotentially relevant articles were identified. These articles went\nthrough abstract review by 2 reviewers. Studies found not to fit\ninclusion criteria after abstract review were excluded. Full-text\nreview was performed independently by 5 reviewers. The kappa\nscores were calculated to determine agreement among reviewers\nwho conducted review of titles and abstracts. All kappa scores\ncalculated were greater than .93. Conflicts were resolved by\nconsensus.\nData Extraction and Risk of Bias Assessment\nData extraction and risk of bias assessment were performed for\neach study independently by 2 reviewers. Data extracted\nincluded study design and setting, participant demographics,\nnumber of participants in each group, intervention components,\ncomparator group components, eHealth tool functionality\nmeasured, and results and significance levels for each outcome\nmeasure. Conflicts in data extraction were resolved by\nconsensus. Risk of bias assessment used questions recommended\nby the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality’s 2014\npublication Methods Guide for Effectiveness and Comparative\nEffectiveness Reviews [18] and was performed for each study\nindependently by 2 reviewers. All conflicts were resolved by\nconsensus. The risk of bias assessment questions are presented\nin Multimedia Appendix 3.\nOutcomes and Analysis\nThe primary and secondary outcomes are listed in Figure 1. The\nprimary outcome was the number of changes made to medication\nregimens following patient self-reporting via an eHealth tool.\nThe included studies varied considerably in populations, eHealth\ntool functionality, outcomes measured, and study design. Due\nto high heterogeneity, meta-analysis of outcomes was not\nfeasible. Therefore, results for each outcome were synthesized\ndescriptively and presented as narrative. Available data on\nbarriers to implementation were extracted from the article text\nand summarized qualitatively so as to heighten awareness of\nimplementation issues.\nFigure 2.

Furthermore, 75 full-text articles were assessed\nfor eligibility, of which 14 were included in this systematic\nreview (see Figure 2 for more details).\nOf the included articles, 13 were randomized controlled trials\n(RCTs) [19-31] and 1 was an open-label intervention [32]. A\ntotal of 10 studies were conducted in the United States [20-29],\nand 1 study was conducted in each of South Korea [19], Canada\n[30], Finland [31], and Denmark [32]. Dates of publication\nranged from 2006 to 2017. The majority were published in 2007\nor later (n=13). This distribution mirrors the increase in both\ninternet and eHealth tool usage beginning in the late 2000s\n[1,33]. Further details on the characteristics of these studies can\nbe seen in Table 1.

The remaining 11 RCTs used participants as the\nunit of randomization [19-21,23-25,27-31].\nA total of 4 RCTs focused on pediatric and adolescent asthma\npatients [21,23-25]; 1 study focused on adult asthma patients\n[30]. Moreover, 1 trial included only elderly patients (aged 65\nyears and older) and focused on medication self-management\nand safety [20]. The remaining 7 trials all included both adult\nand elderly participants. From these studies, 1 focused on\npatients with depression [27]; 3 on patients with type 2 diabetes\n[19,22,31]; 2 on medication safety and use, including\nidentification of ADEs [26,28] using eHealth tools; and 1 on\nidentifying adverse effects in patients receiving chemotherapy\n[29].\nIn 3 studies, use of an eHealth tool in the intervention group\nwas compared with usual care plus links to relevant websites\n[24,25,28]. Simon et al [27] compared their Web-based\nmessaging eHealth tool for depression and Web-based\nmessaging system to usual care with Web-based messaging\nbetween patients and health care providers. Gustafson et al [23]\nused nearly identical interventions in both groups; the control\ngroup was restricted from accessing the eHealth tool but\nparticipated in other aspects of the intervention (clinical visits,\ninterviews, patient education, etc). Fiks et al [21] also used a\nusual care group with no access to the intervention Web portal;\nhowever, all health care providers had access to a computerized\ndecision support system. Moreover, 2 studies [22,26] utilized\na double-dummy style intervention, where both groups used\nWeb-based PHRs to record information that differed only in\ncontent. Cho et al [19] compared an electronic blood glucose\n(BG) monitoring system with an informal paper-based\nmonitoring system, with both groups receiving diabetes\neducation and regular clinical visits. Chrischilles et al [20]\nutilized a conventional usual care group without supplementary\ninformation or resources. Mooney et al [29] used a\nself-monitoring tool to manage chemotherapy symptoms. Ahmed\net al [30] developed an asthma portal to view patient’s personal\nhealth information, monitor patients, and provide feedback on\nself-management strategies. Karhula et al [31] used a\nmanagement system for patient self-monitoring of diabetes.\nOnly 1 study was identified as an open-label intervention study,\nwhich included a comparator group [32]. Carlsen et al [32] used\nan eHealth tool to monitor responses of patients with\ninflammatory bowel disease to determine the need to adjust\ntreatment interval or dose.\nQuality of Included Studies\nFigure 3 displays a summary of the risk of bias assessment. The\nstudies, overall, were of moderate quality, with studies ranging\nfrom poor to good. Common issues included small numbers of\nparticipants, lack of blinding, poor description of interventions,\nand contamination of intervention. Many trials relied only on\npatient self-reported data (as would be expected based on the\ntopic), which can introduce bias if methods to ensure validity\nand reliability are not demonstrated.\nTypes of Electronic Health Tools\nFrom the 14 included studies, 11 unique eHealth tools were\ndescribed. The 2 RCTs by Joseph et al [24,25] utilized the same\nasthma management eHealth tool. The cluster RCT by Schnipper\net al [26] used a Web-based PHR to record information that\ndiffered only in content, which was nested within the larger\nRCT by Grant et al [22]. Two studies by Fiks and Ahmed used\na Web-based portal for asthma symptom management [21,30].\nEach study and eHealth tool is described in Multimedia\nAppendix 4. Features and functionalities of the eHealth tools\nare also presented in Table 2. Although Schnipper [26] and\nGrant [22] use the same eHealth tool, Schnipper’s study [26]\ninvestigates a specific medication module. Thus, they have been\ncounted separately here.\nAll 11 eHealth tools from all 14 studies included a component\nwhere patients could self-report medication management\ninformation or changes, including symptoms, health data,\nadverse effects, or ADEs. A total of 12 studies included\nWeb-based patient questionnaires or surveys [20,21,23-32].\nMany studies used validated patient questionnaires but several\ndeveloped their own. A list of patient questionnaires utilized\nby each study is presented in Table 3. In addition, 10 eHealth\ntools included patient educational resources [20,21,23-26,28-31].\nDetails of these resources are also listed in Table 3. Cho et al\n[19] measured outcomes by having a patient record their BG\nreadings in the eHealth tool. Patients were also interviewed in\nperson by clinicians every 3 months. Schnipper et al [26] had\nparticipants complete medication electronic journals, where\nthey would note discrepancies between a Web-based medication\nlist and their actual medications as taken. Karhula et al [31]\nused a 36-question survey for patients to report their\nhealth-related quality of life (HRQoL) score at baseline and\npost intervention.\nOutcomes of Included Studies\nThe results of each study by outcome can be seen in Multimedia\nAppendix 5.\nPrimary Outcome: Changes in Use of Medications and\nOther Therapies\nA total of 6 RCTs [19-22,24,27] and 1 open-label intervention\n[32] measured this outcome. Moreover, 5 RCTs [20,22,24,27,32]\nfound significant increases in medication changes as a result of\nusing eHealth tools. All medication change outcomes reported\nwere consistent with more appropriate prescribing and use of\nmedications.\nChrischilles et al [20] found a significant reduction in use of\nmore than 2 nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the\nintervention group (14.1% vs 19%, P=.035). A nonsignificant\ntrend approaching significance was seen for decreased number\nof over-the-counter medications used in the eHealth tool group\n(P=.05) [20]. Grant et al [22] found a significant increase in the\nnumber of diabetes mellitus–related medication changes in the\nintervention group (43.5 vs 6.2, P<.001). They also found that\na significantly higher proportion of patients in the intervention\ngroup had medications initiated or dosages changed for\nhypertension (13% vs 0%, P=.02) and hyperlipidemia (11% vs\n0%, P=.03).\nJ Med Internet Res 2018 | vol. 20 | iss. 12 | e294 | p. 6https://www.jmir.org/2018/12/e294/\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nLancaster et alJOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH\nXSL•FO\nRenderX\nFigure 3.

Carlsen et al [54] showed that eHealth tools\nmight help identify instances where medication changes may\nbe appropriate. Moreover, Carlsen et al [54] showed that the\neHealth tool used resulted in at least one significant effect on\nchanges to medication use; a significant difference was found\nbetween intervals of treatment for the eHealth group relative to\nthe control group (2.35; 95% CI 1.5 to 3.2; P<.001) [54].\nIn contrast, Cho et al [19] found no significance in terms of\ntotal occasions of drug modification through the use of their\neHealth tool intervention, internet-based glucose monitoring\nsystem (4.7 vs 5.5, P=.36). Fiks et al [21] provided descriptive\nevidence regarding the mean number of medications per child\nin both the intervention and control groups, yet no\nbetween-groups comparisons were made.\nSecondary Outcome: Changes in Signs and Symptoms\nof Health Conditions\nA total of 9 RCTs [19,21-25,27,30,31] and 1 open-label\nintervention [32] measured changes in signs and symptoms of\nhealth conditions. Of these, 8 reported at least one significant\nimprovement in signs and symptoms [19,21,23-25,27,30,31].\nJ Med Internet Res 2018 | vol. 20 | iss. 12 | e294 | p. 9https://www.jmir.org/2018/12/e294/\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nLancaster et alJOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH\nXSL•FO\nRenderX\nMoreover, 4 studies found improvements in asthma symptoms\n[21,23-25], 1 found a significant reduction in hemoglobin A1c\n(HbA1c) [19], and 2 found a significant improvement in\ndepression score [27,30].\nFiks et al [21] reported 17 instances of uncontrolled asthma in\n13 children. They found that parents of active group children\nmissed fewer days of work (mean of <0.1 vs 1.5, P=.001) and\nthat the active group had less frequent flare-ups (mean of 1.4\nvs 3.8, P=.02). Gustafson et al [23] found an increase in asthma\ncontrol in the active group (mean change of −0.42 vs −0.11 on\na 7-point Likert scale, P=.01).\nJoseph et al [24] found that the active group had a lower risk\nfor number of symptom nights (risk ratio [RR]=0.4, 95% CI 0.2\nto 0.8, P=.009), symptom days (RR=0.5, 95% CI 0.4 to 0.8,\nP=.003), days of restricted activity (RR=0.5, 95% CI 0.3 to 0.8,\nP=.02), and school days missed (RR=0.3, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.7,\nP=.006). In another study, Joseph et al [25] reported a lower\nrisk in the active group for symptom days (RR=0.8, 95% CI 0.6\nto 1.0, P=.01). Following subgroup analysis, it was found that\nteenagers with moderate to severe asthma had fewer symptom\ndays (RR=0.6, 95% CI 0.5 to 0.9, P=.01), total school days\nmissed (RR=0.5, 95% CI 0.3 to 0.8, P=.009), school days missed\nbecause of asthma (RR=0.4, 95% CI 0.2 to 0.8, P=.007), and\ndays of restricted activity (RR=0.6, 95% CI 0.4 to 0.9, P=.03).\nSimon et al [27] reported a significant between-groups\ndifference in mean depression score favoring the intervention\ngroup (mean score of 0.95 vs 1.17, P=.04). Ahmed et al [30]\nreported a statistically significant difference in depression using\nthe Patient Health Questionnaire scale, as scores improved at\n6 months (mean change −0.27, 95% CI −0.37 to −0.18 for a\nchange of 5 units). Karhula et al [31] found no significant\nbetween-group difference in HbA1c (change −0.106, 95% CI\n−0.33 to 0.11, P=.34); however, they did find a statistically\nsignificant decrease in waist circumference between intervention\nand control (change −1.711, 95% CI −3.042 to −0.38, P=.01).\nCho et al [19] did find a decrease in mean HbA1c in the active\ngroup (mean of 6.7% vs 7.4%, P=.006) at 30 months. Grant et\nal [22] found no differences between groups for HbA1c and for\npercentage of patients at target HbA1c levels. Similarly, Carlsen\net al [32] found no significant difference for trough infliximab\nconcentration when controlling for treatment intervals in the\nstudy (change of −2.19, 95% CI −5.37 to 0.99, P=.18).\nSecondary Outcome: Patient Self-Management and\nEfficacy\nA total of 5 RCTs measured this outcome [20,21,23,26,30]. In\naddition, 3 of the studies found increases in patient\nself-management or self-efficacy as a result of using eHealth\ntools [23,26,30].\nGustafson et al [23] found that self-efficacy had a positive,\nsignificant effect on Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ)\nscores (beta=.48, P=.01). They also found a positive significant\neffect of intervention on ACQ score when mediated by\ninformation competence (τ=−.235, P=.02). Schnipper et al [26]\nfound that significantly more participants in the intervention\ngroup always disclosed drug therapy problems or new symptoms\nto clinicians (97.9% vs 87.1%, P<.001). Ahmed et al [30] found\nthat a significant change in minimum asthma-related quality of\nlife questionnaire adjusted for self-efficacy in adult asthma\npatients (0.24, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.32). Fiks et al [21] found that\nparents of children with asthma who used the eHealth tool\nimproved their ability to manage asthma, although their findings\nwere not statistically significant. In addition, they became more\naware of the importance of ongoing attention to treatment.\nChrischilles et al [20] found no difference between groups in\nability to recognize adverse effects; however, in their as-treated\nanalysis, they did find that high-frequency users had higher\nodds of recognizing symptoms and adverse effects (odds ratio,\nOR=1.76; 95% CI 1.08 to 2.86).\nSecondary Outcome: Medication Use Behavior\n(Adherence)\nA total of 3 RCTs measured this outcome, all using measures\nof medication adherence as a surrogate for medication use\nbehavior [20,23,24]. None of these studies reported\nimprovements over the 6 [20] and 12 months [23,24] studied.\nSecondary Outcome: Medication Reconciliation and\nRecommendations to Change Drug Therapy\nA total of 3 RCTs reported on this outcome [19,20,26]. Only\nSchnipper et al [26] found improvements in determining\nmedication discrepancies when linking documented and\npatient-reported medication regimens using eHealth tools.\nSchnipper et al [26] explored the effects of a PHR medication\nmodule on medication accuracy and safety, reporting\nsignificantly lower odds of having discordant medications in\nthe active group (OR=0.71, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.94, P=.01). In\naddition, Schnipper et al [26] found a significantly lower risk\nof discrepancies with the potential to cause severe harm in the\nactive group (RR=0.31, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.92, P=.04). The\nnumber of medication discrepancies per patient with the\npotential for harm approached significance as a result of using\neHealth tools (P=.05) [26].\nCho et al [19] acknowledged, using descriptive data, that a small\npercentage of individuals may have recommendations made for\nmodification of drug therapy as a result of using their eHealth\ntool. Chrischilles et al [20] reported several instances of\nrecommendations being made to alter drug therapy through\nmedication reconciliation, none of which were significant.\nSecondary Outcome: Adverse Effects and Adverse Drug\nEvents\nA total of 1 open-label intervention [32] and 5 RCTs measured\nthis outcome [20,21,26,28,29]. Only Mooney et al [29] reported\nidentification of adverse effects in favor of using eHealth tools,\nas there was a significant reduction in 10 of the 11 chemotherapy\nadverse effects in the intervention group (P value: .02 to <.001)\nrelative to usual care. Descriptive evidence from Fiks et al [21]\nshowed 1 instance of medication-related adverse effects. Carlsen\net al [32] provided descriptive evidence that eHealth tools may\nlead to the identification of ADEs. The remaining 3 studies\nreporting on the identification of adverse effects [20] or ADEs\n[26,28] found no significant difference between intervention\nand control.\nJ Med Internet Res 2018 | vol. 20 | iss. 12 | e294 | p. 10https://www.jmir.org/2018/12/e294/\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nLancaster et alJOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH\nXSL•FO\nRenderX\nSecondary Outcome: Health Services Utilization\nA total of 6 RCTs reported health service utilization outcomes\n[21,24,25,27,28,30]. Of these, only Joseph et al [24] found a\nsignificantly lower risk of hospitalizations as a result of using\neHealth tools (RR=0.20, 95% CI 0.2 to 0.9, P=.01). The\nremaining 5 studies [21,25,27,28,30] found no difference\nbetween intervention and control groups in terms of health\nservice utilization\nSecondary Outcome: Patient Self-Reported Overall\nHealth Status\nA total of 4 studies measured this outcome [24,30-32], and none\nof the studies found differences in cumulative quality of life\nscore between groups or a significant effect on overall health\nstatus.\nSecondary Outcome: Patient Satisfaction With Health\nCare\nA total of 2 RCTs [21,27] and 1 open-label intervention [32]\nmeasured this outcome. Only Simon et al [27] found that patient\nsatisfaction improved as a result of using an eHealth tool. Simon\net al [27] found that a significantly larger proportion of\nparticipants in the intervention group reported being very\nsatisfied with the quality of their depression-related care\n(χ2\n1=8.38, P=.004). Fiks et al [21] found no significant changes\nwhen measuring this outcome, whereas Carlsen et al [32]\nprovided positive descriptive evidence of patient and parent\nsatisfaction using eHealth tools.\nSubgroup Analyses\nA total of 4 RCTs investigated the use of eHealth tools in\nchildren and teens with asthma [21,23-25]. There is evidence\nthat eHealth tools may have the potential to reduce symptoms\nof asthma, frequency of asthma flare-ups, and number of days\nof school or work missed because of asthma [21,23-25]. They\nmay also promote better asthma control, availability and use of\nrescue inhalers, and may have the potential to improve asthma\nsymptoms in vulnerable groups (ie, African-American\nadolescents living in urban centers) [24,25].\nSubgroup analysis also found that multifaceted interventions\ncombining use of eHealth tools with clinician support or case\nmanagement and eHealth tools utilizing direct patient-provider\ncommunication might be more effective at improving some\naspects of patient self-management and self-efficacy\n[23,26,30,31]. Both studies utilizing multifaceted interventions\nand direct patient-provider communication that measured these\noutcomes found positive significant results [23,26], whereas\nboth studies using only eHealth tools with no patient-provider\ncommunication found no significant differences [20,21].\nDetailed results from the subgroup analyses can be found in\nMultimedia Appendix 4.\nBarriers to Implementation\nMany studies reported barriers to the implementation of eHealth\ntools. The most common barrier was lack of participant\nengagement, resulting in low eHealth tool utilization rates. This\nwas reported by 9 of the 14 studies [20,22-27,31,32]. A total of\n3 studies noted distinct differences between high and low\neHealth tool users [19,20,26], with high users generally seeing\nmore improvements in health-related outcomes. Chrischilles et\nal’s study [20] was the only study to investigate the use of\neHealth tools specifically in patients aged more than 65 years,\nand they found that patient engagement was negatively\nassociated with age. Grant el al [22] found that patients with\npoor metabolic control were less likely to participate. The\nauthors of several studies reported that a small sample size, high\nlevel of missing data, reduced power, and lower generalizability\nwere observed as a result of low eHealth tool utilization and\npatient engagement [20,22,23,25-28,31,32]. Another important\nbarrier, reported by 3 studies [22,26,29], was lack of clinician\nengagement and poor clinician training. This was generally\nbecause of time and workflow constraints [22,29] and lack of\nmotivation [26,29]. Other implementation issues noted included\nlack of access to the internet [30], time burden of entering\ninformation [30], poor usability of eHealth tools [26], difficulties\nobtaining informed consent [24,25], and dilution of the\nintervention effect by the control group [23,26,28].\nDiscussion\nSummary of Evidence\nEvidence from 4 RCTs and 1 open-label intervention\n[20,22,24,27,32] show that eHealth tools focusing on symptom\nand adverse effect self-reporting can prompt positive changes\nin medication prescribing and use. In addition, the majority of\neHealth tools studied were able to improve patient symptoms,\nregardless of functionalities, complexity, and differences in\nintervention. Those eHealth tools were particularly studied and\nfound to be beneficial for improving signs and symptoms in\nchildren and adolescents with asthma [21,23-25]. This review\nsupports the inclusion of patient entry or editing of symptoms\ninto eHealth tools for the purposes of monitoring and reporting\noutcomes from the use of medications.\nEvidence was found that eHealth tools improved the outcome\nof patient self-management and self-efficacy. Subgroup analysis\nfound that eHealth tools that allow patients and clinicians to\ncommunicate directly, and multifaceted interventions combining\neHealth tools with clinician support and case management might\nlead to greater increases in patient self-management and\nself-efficacy. It is notable that more significant improvements\nwere found for more objective outcome measures, such as\nnumber of medication changes and clinical signs, and less were\nfound for more subjective outcome measures such as\nself-management and self-efficacy. It may also be that sample\nsizes were too small to detect differences, particularly if this\nwas not the primary objective for these studies. It is likely that\nthe eHealth tools under investigation either did not provide\neffective content or functionalities to help participants improve\nself-management and medication management in participants\nor the tools used to measure these outcomes were not able to\ndetect any differences between groups. Another possibility is\nthe lack of patient understanding of chronic disease and poor\nperception of health goals.\nIt was thought that eHealth tools that focus on improvement of\npatient self-efficacy and self-management might lead to\nimproved medication-use behavior, which in turn may lead to\nJ Med Internet Res 2018 | vol. 20 | iss. 12 | e294 | p. 11https://www.jmir.org/2018/12/e294/\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nLancaster et alJOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH\nXSL•FO\nRenderX\nchanges in medication use, identification of real or potential\nADEs, improvement in signs and symptoms, and overall\nimprovement in HRQoL. However, there is not enough evidence\nto draw conclusions as to the effectiveness of eHealth tools for\nidentification of adverse effects, improving medication-use\nbehavior, increasing recommendations to medication therapies\nand improving medication reconciliation, improving health\nservice utilization, and improving overall health status and\npatient satisfaction. Only a small number of included studies\ninvestigated these outcomes; it is likely that with such a small\noverall sample size, it was not possible to find differences\nbetween groups.\nHow Do These Results Compare With Other Reviews?\nAs with most systematic reviews on the subject of eHealth tools\n[7,8,33,54-57], this review found at best moderate evidence that\npatient reporting via eHealth tools can lead to improved clinical\noutcomes such as symptom reduction.\nA 2012 systematic review by Ammenwerth et al found that use\nof patient portals linked to a PHR led to significant increases\nin medication adjustments in diabetic patients [55]. Other\nreviews and primary articles have also indicated that the use of\neHealth tools may be more effective in specific patient\npopulations such as patients with cancer [4,29,34,58]. This\nreview found evidence that use of eHealth tools might increase\nthe number of medication adjustments in diabetic patients\n[19,22]. In addition, patient-reported symptoms and adverse\neffects were used to identify toxicities in cancer patients, and\nin several instances, it lead to medication changes. It was also\nfound that eHealth tools might improve signs and symptoms of\nasthma in children and teens [21,23-25].\nOverall, this review supports findings by Ammenwerth et al\n[55] that interventions may be more effective at improving\nhealth outcomes if they combine eHealth tool features such as\npatient-provider communication and interactive coaching with\neHealth tool use (see, eg, [21,22,26,28] as well as Table 2 and\nMultimedia Appendix 4 considering subgroup analyses).\nEvidence from this review indicates that eHealth tools in\ncombination with clinician support or case management, and\neHealth tools that encourage provider-patient communication\nmay improve patient self-management and self-efficacy when\ncompared with tools without these features [22,23,26].\nStrengths and Limitations\nTo our knowledge, this is the first systematic review of eHealth\ninterventions focusing on patient self-reporting of symptoms\nand adverse effects. The review’s search strategy was augmented\nby reference searching. This review was limited to studies that\nincluded medication-related outcomes. The majority of studies\nincluded in this review were RCTs, most of which were of\nmoderate quality.\nThis review also has a number of weaknesses. It was limited to\nstudies published in English, which may have excluded relevant\narticles. No searching of grey literature was performed, as we\nfocused on empirical work published in academic journals, and\nso it is possible that some early non–peer-reviewed reports may\nhave been missed. We acknowledge the lack of definitional\nclarity surrounding the term eHealth and believe future research\nshould focus on establishing better consensus for this term.\nThere was considerable variety among the interventions in the\nstudies, some of which included features such as direct health\ncare provider follow-up, thus making it more complicated to\ndetermine which outcomes could be specifically attributable to\nusing an eHealth tool. As this review also examined different\npopulations of varying sample sizes and medical conditions for\neHealth tools, it may be difficult to detect differences and\ngeneralize findings and conclusions. We did not include\nqualitative studies in our review because the goal of our study\nwas to better understand the effectiveness and impact of changes\nto medication regimens based on quantifiable differences in\nusing eHealth tools for self-reporting adverse effects and\nsymptoms that promote changes to medication use versus a\ncomparator. We value the insight of qualitative studies that have\nbeen investigated elsewhere [59,60]. Additional exploration of\nqualitative literature to better understand how use of these types\nof eHealth tools can generate impacts on medication use and\nhealth would be helpful.\nImplications for Practice and Future Research\nWhere possible, health care providers should encourage patient\nuse of eHealth tools for symptom and adverse effect\nself-reporting. eHealth tools may be especially useful for\nreducing symptoms in certain populations, for example, children\nand teenagers with asthma. eHealth tools might also encourage\npatients to improve self-management behaviors and participate\nin shared decision making with clinicians. Having information\nfrom the EMR entered directly into the eHealth tool may reduce\nthe burden on the patient to routinely update their clinical\ninformation (something that only highly motivated patients are\nlikely to do regularly) [6]. Clinicians should be encouraged to\ncommunicate with patients via eHealth tools where possible,\nespecially where patients are experiencing worsening of\nsymptoms or medication-related adverse effects. Evidence\nsuggests that using technologies such as mobile apps and SMS\ntext messaging may improve patient engagement by allowing\nquick, convenient communication without a computer or internet\nconnection [23,27]. Clinicians should be supported in their\neHealth tool use, and interventions should focus on clinician\ntraining and engagement. Ensuring that interventions can be\nsuccessfully incorporated into physician workflow is important\n[22,26].\nThere is a paucity of primary research articles investigating\neHealth tools and their impact on medication use. Studies are\ngenerally small and of moderate quality. Large-scale RCTs\nfocusing on the use of eHealth tools for medication and\nsymptom management should be undertaken to establish more\nhigh-quality evidence. This is especially important given how\nubiquitous the use of medication is. Furthermore, the effects of\npatient self-management and self-efficacy on medication use\nand symptom experience are not well studied; more research in\nthis area could help drive creation of medication-focused\neHealth tools. Low patient engagement and eHealth tool\nutilization were commonly noted implementation barriers; it\ncould be that patients were not engaged in eHealth tool use\nenough for them to feel an impact on their satisfaction with\nhealth care or overall quality of life. Descriptive evidence shows\nlow proportions of patients felt that eHealth tools improved\nJ Med Internet Res 2018 | vol. 20 | iss. 12 | e294 | p. 12https://www.jmir.org/2018/12/e294/\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nLancaster et alJOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH\nXSL•FO\nRenderX\ntheir care or communication with providers, indicating that\ndevelopment of eHealth tools should focus on functionalities\nand outcomes that are important to the patient. This may be\nachieved by utilizing research on patient motivation and\nbehavior change to increase patient engagement [20,24,25].\nConclusions\nThe results of this review show initial and promising findings\nthat specialized eHealth tools can be used for reporting and\nmonitoring of symptoms and medication-related adverse effects\nand some evidence that use of eHealth tools have the potential\nto identify instances where changes in medication use may be\nappropriate. A modest amount of mixed evidence was found,\ndemonstrating that eHealth tools can improve patient\nself-management and self-efficacy. Very little or no evidence\nwas found to demonstrate that use of eHealth tools could\nincrease numbers of medication recommendations or improve\nmedication-taking behavior, health services utilization,\nidentification of adverse effects, overall health status, and patient\nsatisfaction. eHealth tools may be more effective at promoting\nmedication changes and improving patient self-management\nand self-efficacy if they provide mechanisms for direct\npatient-provider communication and may be more effective in\ncertain populations such as children and teenagers with asthma.\nAcknowledgments\nThis study results from an Applied Health Research Question submitted by Canada Health Infoway to the Ontario Pharmacy\nResearch Collaboration (OPEN).
