    "abstract": "This study investigates the capabilities of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) in automating GDPR compliance documentation, specifically in generating data categories—types of personal data (e.g., names, email addresses)—for processing activity records, a document required by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). By comparing four state-of-the-art open-source models with the closed-source GPT-4, we evaluate their performance using benchmarks tailored to GDPR tasks: a multiple-choice benchmark testing contextual knowledge (evaluated by accuracy and F1 score) and a generation benchmark evaluating structured data generation. In addition, we conduct four experiments using context-augmenting techniques such as few-shot prompting and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). We evaluate these on performance metrics such as latency, structure, grammar, validity, and contextual understanding. Our results show that open-source models, particularly Qwen2-7B, achieve performance comparable to GPT-4, demonstrating their potential as cost-effective and privacy-preserving alternatives. Context-augmenting techniques show mixed results, with RAG improving performance for known categories but struggling with categories not contained in the knowledge base. Open-source models excel at structured legal tasks, although challenges remain in handling ambiguous legal language and unstructured scenarios. These findings underscore the viability of open-source models for GDPR compliance, while highlighting the need for fine-tuning and improved context augmentation to address complex use cases.",
