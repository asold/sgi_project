However, diagnos-\ning rare diseases is particularly challenging due to the often small number of affected\nindividuals with a specific disorder and the variation in disease presentation between\npatients. Consequently, patients with rare diseases often endure a diagnostic odyssey,\nundergoing numerous tests and consultations over years before receiving an accurate\ndiagnosis.\nMost rare diseases have a Mendelian basis and are the result of variation in one or\nat most a small number of genes [2]. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolu-\ntionized the diagnosis of Mendelian diseases and whole exome and genome sequencing\ncan identify genetic variants in individuals which may cause the disorder; the number\nof these variants ranges from around 20-40,000 in the whole exome to over a million\nin whole genome sequencing [3, 4].\nThe challenge lies in identifying the genetic variant or variants that lead to the\ndisease in a particular individual. Although sequencing has made a huge impact on\ndisease identification, only about 50% of patients end up with molecular diagnosis\n[5]. A typical genome will contain 100-200 genes with protein-truncating variants and\naround 10,000 to 12,000 sites with variants causing changes in peptide sequence. Esti-\nmates suggest that an individual carries around 100 loss-of-function (LOF) alleles with\naround 20 completely inactivated [6]. In a recent large-scale study of European pop-\nulations, most individuals were assessed to have 2-5 autosomal recessive pathogenic\nor likely pathogenic variants in known Mendelian disease genes, most of which had\n2\n .

Most individuals within a population, there-\nfore, carry at least one disease allele for any recessive disease, and many potentially\npathogenic variants in genes where the variant either does not meet the loss-of-function\nthreshold or where the gene is not already disease-associated. In a study of a large\nnumber of whole exome sequences, 3,230 genes highly intolerant to a loss-of-function\nwere identified, 72% of which had no established human disease phenotype [8]. Priori-\ntising which of the potentially pathogenic variants cause disease in a particular patient\nis therefore a complex task, especially given phenotypic variation and the action of\nmodifiers.\nSeveral methods are commonly employed to reduce the number of variants to\nconsider, including the mode of inheritance, the frequency of observing the variant\nwithin different populations, and the functional impact a variant has on the function\nof a gene product. However, even after these filters have been applied, there are often\nstill several variants left that need to be considered and evaluated [9–11].\nIn response to this challenge, various methods have been developed to predict\nwhether a variant is pathogenic or will alter the function of a gene product. These\nmethods include rule-based methods and machine learning methods [12, 13]. However,\nnone of these methods is entirely accurate, and, moreover, multiple genes may suffer\nfrom a total loss of function without any abnormal phenotypic effects [14, 15]. The\nfurther challenge is therefore to identify which of the candidate variants is responsible\nfor the phenotype observed.\nPhenotype-based methods rank genes or genotypes based on whether they are likely\nto cause the phenotypes observed in a patient. Phenotype-based methods require that\nphenotypes are specified in a formal language, usually based on the Human Phenotype\nOntology (HPO) [16]. The HPO is an ontology that provides over 17,000 standardized\nphenotype descriptions and several resources have been developed around the HPO,\nincluding large genotype-to-phenotype databases.\nPhenotype-based methods for prioritizing genes or genotypes typically compare\nthe phenotypes observed in a patient with the phenotypes in a genotype-to-phenotype\ndatabase [17]. Because phenotypes may be variable, measures of semantic similarity\nare usually employed; an ontology-based semantic similarity measure uses the knowl-\nedge in an ontology to define a similarity measure between entities associated with\nontology terms [18, 19]. Phenotype-based methods are therefore crucially dependent\non three different resources: a phenotype ontology that provides domain knowledge by\nstructuring and relating phenotype terms; a genotype-to-phenotype database; and a\nsemantic similarity measure. Phenotype ontologies are manually curated and rely on\ndomain expertise as well as knowledge of formal semantics [20]; genotype-to-phenotype\ndatabases are created from literature or large-scale experiments and may be incom-\nplete or noisy [16]; and, although a large number of semantic similarity measures have\nbeen developed, they have different biases which makes them a challenge to apply\nconsistently [21].\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) are now available that are trained in a self-\nsupervised manner on large text corpora [22]. LLMs trained on large text corpora can\nalso perform a large variety of different tasks and can further be fine-tuned to follow\ninstructions or “prompts” [23]. They have been applied successfully to a wide range\n3\n . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseIt is made available under a \nperpetuity. \n is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in(which was not certified by peer review)preprint \nThe copyright holder for thisthis version posted November 16, 2023. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.11.16.23298615doi: medRxiv preprint \nof tasks, including clinical question answering [24], medical reasoning, record keeping,\nand patient facing interactions [25]. We explore the potential of LLMs to overcome the\nlimitations of formal phenotype similarity-based methods for ranking genes or vari-\nants. Their training on large text corpora may allow them to access the same, or more,\ninformation as is used in constructing genotype-to-phenotype databases and the phe-\nnotype ontologies, and potentially to capture semantic relationships between concepts\n[26]. Consequently, they may also be able to estimate semantic similarity as well as,\nor better than, ontology-dependent similarity measures.\nHere, we apply and evaluate three LLMs, GPT-3.5-turbo [27], GPT-4 [28], and\nFalcon180B [29], in ranking genes based on clinically observed phenotypes, and we\ninclude the LLMs as part of a workflow that identifies disease-causing variants in\nwhole exome or whole genome sequencing data. For our evaluation, we use three\ndifferent synthetic datasets as well as one dataset of patients with undiagnosed genetic\ndiseases, and we demonstrate by direct comparison to state of the art methods that\nLLMs can improve phenotype-based ranking of genes over all state of the art methods.\nFurthermore, interactions with LLMs can be used to generate explanations for ranking\ngenes and can also be used to refine ranking results, demonstrating that LLMs have\nthe potential to be used as diagnostic assistants. However, we also observed several\ncases of “hallucinations” and other biases, which need to be addressed before LLMs\ncan be used reliably in a clinical context.\n2 Materials and Methods\n2.1 Datasets Used\nWe used three benchmark datasets to conduct our experiments. The first dataset,\nGPCards [30], is a manually curated dataset of genotype–phenotype associations. We\nrandomly selected 50 variants from distinct genes along with their corresponding clini-\ncal phenotypes from GPCards. The phenotypes in GPCards are represented as natural\nlanguage terms and do not rely on a structured vocabulary or ontology. We use the\nGPCards dataset to develop prompts and assess the performance of the LLMs on\ndifferent prompts.\nThe second dataset is the October 2023 release of ClinVar [31] a publicly accessi-\nble database detailing genomic variations and their connections to disease. We focused\nparticularly on the new variants included in ClinVar between July 2, 2023, and Octo-\nber 7, 2023. From this subset of data, we randomly selected 100 variants, each from\na different gene, associated with diseases in Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man\n(OMIM) [32] We identified the phenotypes corresponding to the OMIM disease using\nthe HPO database [33] accessed on October 8, 2023.\nThe third dataset is the Phenotype-Associated Variants in Saudi Arabia (PAVS)\ndatabase [34], a public database of genotype–phenotype relations identified in Saudi\nindividuals. PAVS combines a collection of clinically validated pathogenic variants\nwith manually curated variants specific to the Saudi population, each accompanied\nby its associated phenotypes mapped to HPO codes. We used the PAVS dataset to\ncompare LLMs with ontology-based gene prioritization methods. The phenotypes in\nPAVS also correspond closely to clinical phenotype observations, unlike phenotypes\n4\n .

We\nrandomly selected 500 variants each from a distinct gene along with their associated\nphenotypes from PAVS.\nFor each of the benchmark sets, we generated a set of pairs ( G, P) of a list of\ngenes G = (G 1, ..., Gn) and a set of phenotypes P = (P 1, ..., Pm). The phenotypes\nare identical to the phenotypes from the benchmark sets (which contain genotype–\nphenotype relations); the list of genes G contains the causative gene (i.e., the genotype\nmapped to the underlying gene) and a set of genes randomly chosen either from all\nhuman genes or from all genes with a genotype in the benchmark set. We vary the\nsize of the gene set G by randomly choosing different numbers of genes to add; the\ncardinality of G ranges from 5 to 100 (cardinalities 5, 25, 50, 75, 100).\n2.2 Baseline methods\nWe evaluated several state-of-the-art methods for phenotype-based gene prioritization,\nall implemented in the Exomiser [35] system. We use three main methods as baseline:\nExomeWalker [36], PHIVE [37], and PhenIX [38], as well as their weighted combination\n(labeled “Exomiser score”). Exomiser uses phenotypes in the form of HPO terms as\ninput and, because it is designed for ranking variants in whole exome or whole genome\nsequencing, it outputs a ranked list of variants. We generate a random variant in\neach gene as input and ignore all variant-related scores produced by Exomiser in our\nevaluation.\nThe different algorithms implemented in Exomiser differ primarily in the type of\nbackground knowledge they employ [35]. The most basic algorithm, PhenIX, relies only\non human phenotypes to rank candidate genes [38], and therefore does not provide a\nphenotype-based score or rank for genes that are not known as human disease genes.\nThe PHIVE algorithm, the other hand, compares the input phenotypes to mouse\nmodel phenotypes and relies on cross-species phenotype integration and human–mouse\northology for ranking candidate genes [37]. ExomeWalker [36] employs protein–protein\ninteraction networks and the guilt-by-association principle to rank candidate genes.\nThe final Exomiser score is based on a logistic regression model that assigns weights\nto the individual scores and generates a combined score.\nWe utilized the default settings to execute the tools on the generated synthetic\ndatasets from PAVS and ClinVar, inputting the acquired HPO codes for each variant.\nWe assessed the gene scores for each prediction method, excluding variant scores, since\nour focus is on gene prioritization.\n2.2.1 Large Language Models Used\nWe used three LLMs as part of this study, GPT-3.5-Turbo [22] and GPT-4 [39] and\nthe Falcon180B model [40]. GPT-3.5-Turbo is an instruction-following LLM with 20\nbillion parameters, trained on data up to January 2022. GPT-4 is a multi-modal\ninstruction-following model; the model is commercially available as a blackbox model\nand no technical details are publicly known. We used GPT-4 trained with data up\nto April 2023. Falcon 180B is an LLM that is publicly available. Falcon 180B was\ntrained on 3.5 trillion tokens primarily consisting of data from the RefinedWeb dataset\n5\n . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International licenseIt is made available under a \nperpetuity. \n is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in(which was not certified by peer review)preprint \nThe copyright holder for thisthis version posted November 16, 2023. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.11.16.23298615doi: medRxiv preprint \n[41]. Falcon contains 180 billion parameters. It is available as a base model and as\na pre-trained model for conversations. We used the Falcon 180B-Chat version in our\nexperiments, with training data up to November 2022.\nWe accessed GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4 through the API provided by OpenAI\nInc. We also used the Falcon 180B-Chat model and ran it using eight A100 80GB\nGPUs as recommended in the release notes. We restricted the model to return only\ntokens with high confidence by setting the do\nsample variable to false.\n2.3 Prompt engineering\nAs part of our interaction with the LLMs, we designed a structured prompts to engage\nwith the LLMs through their API. We followed the GPT best practice guidelines [42]\nto design our prompts. We wrote clear instructions by following the suggested tactics\n(e.g., ask the model to adopt a persona, use delimiters to clearly indicate distinct\nparts of the input, specify the output format) and evaluated each prompt on our\nbenchmarking datasets.\nTable 1 shows the prompts with which we experimented (Table A1 illustrates\nexample prompts). Prompts Q1, Q2, and Q3 are zero-shot [43], while Q4 constitutes a\none-shot, chain-of-thought prompt [43, 44] instructing the LLM specifically on how to\nperform the gene ranking. In Q1, we instruct the LLM to rank the provided gene list.\nIn Q2, additional patient-related information, including sex and mode of inheritance,\nis provided. In Q3, the LLM is prompted to rank genes based on their function,\nexpression site, and relevant animal models if there is insufficient information about\nthe gene itself available. Lastly, Q4, a one-shot, chain-of-thought prompt precisely\ninstructs the LLM on the ranking process and the required output format.\nTo identify the prompt to use, we assessed GPT-3.5-turbo’s performance on\nGPCards using a selection of nine randomly chosen genes and one causative gene\nretrieved from GPCards. Table2 shows the performance results of the different queries,\nincluding several combinations and variations of the queries. Q2+Q3 denotes the uti-\nlization of Q3 when Q2 fails, i.e., when the LLM does not rank a given set of genes\nbased on Q2. The symbol Q2−sign indicates substituting “symptoms” with “signs and\nsymptoms”, whereas Q2−pheno represents replacing “symptoms” with “phenotypes”\nin Q2. Q2-full gene names represents using full gene names instead of their symbols\nin Q2.\n2.4 Rare disease cohort\nWe applied GPT-4 on 32 families presented at King Khalid University Hospital\n(KKUH) in Riyadh.

You return\na ranked list of genes according to the likelihood of the damaging variant in the\ngene causing the phenotypes of the patient.

We ignored the\nexplanations and evaluated the performance of the LLMs in ranking the “correct”\ngene.\nWe also experimented with other prompts, providing the LLM with a “reasoning”\nstrategy about how it should identify relevant genes in the presence or absence of\ndifferent types of information; we also provided an example of input and output to\nthe model. This kind of interaction is a one-shot chain-of-thought prompt [44] because\nwe provide an example and guide the model’s reasoning in ranking the genes based\non phenotypes. The chain-of-thought (see Table 1) we designed is inspired by the\ndifferent types of data that phenotype-based gene- and variant-prioritization methods\nlike Exomiser [35] use.\nTo determine how well LLMs will rank genes based on their associations with a\nset of phenotypes when the number of genes between which it needs to discriminate\nincreases, we increased the number of random genes we added to the causative one,\nfrom 4 to 99 (see Methods). We found that one-shot chain-of-thought prompting has\nthe potential to improve over zero-shot prompting and GPT-4 outperformed all of\nthe LLMs tested (see Table 3). We repeated each experiment five times to determine\nvariance in ranking results and found that the ranks are highly consistent when ranking\ngenes and results generally reproducible (Table B2).\n3.2 LLMs improve on ontology-based ranking methods\nWhile our results on the GPCards dataset show that LLMs can rank genes based on a\nset of phenotypes specified in natural language, the majority of phenotype-based gene-\nor variant-prioritization methods rely on input specified in a formal language based\non phenotype ontologies [17, 35, 51–53]. The use of an ontology removes ambiguity\nin phenotype descriptions and enables access to background knowledge contained in\nphenotype ontologies [20]. To compare the use of LLMs with established ontology-\nbased ranking methods, we followed the same setup in ranking a set of genes and\nidentifying the causative genes given a set of phenotypes, and we compared LLMs with\nthe ontology-based tool Exomiser. Exomiser implements multiple different algorithms\nfor prioritizing candidate genes based on different sources of information; it uses human\nphenotypes in the PhenIX algorithm [ 38], mouse model phenotypes in PHIVE [37],\nhuman and other model organisms phenotypes in hiPHIVE [37], and protein–protein\ninteraction networks in ExomeWalker [36].\nWe used two databases of genotype–phenotype associations for our evaluation and\ncomparison. The first is ClinVar, which is used widely to benchmark variant- and\ngene-prioritization methods. ClinVar contains associations of variants with diseases\n(specified using their OMIM identifiers); the OMIM diseases can then be mapped to\ntheir phenotypes using the HPO database [16]. For evaluation, we used only variants\nthat have been added after the knowledge cut-off date (2 July 2023 – 7 October 2023)\n12\n .

While ClinVar is a comprehensive dataset of genotype–phenotype relations,\nit does not associate variants with phenotypes observed clinically but rather with\nthe disorder. Therefore, we also used the PAVS database, a database of phenotype-\nassociated variants in Saudi Arabia, which contains clinically-reported phenotypes and\nthe associated variants. For both sets of variants, we followed a similar procedure as\nfor our previous evaluation: we input the gene affected by the variant together with 4,\n24, 49, 74, or 99 randomly chosen genes and asked the LLMs to rank the list of genes\ngiven the phenotypes. As GPT-4 was the best-performing model, we only evaluated\nGPT-4 on this task.\nTable 4shows the results when ranking genes based on ClinVar variants and pheno-\ntypes. We found that GPT-4 with a one-shot chain-of-thought query performs better\nthan a zero-shot query, and that GPT-4 ranked genes better than all baseline meth-\nods when only a few genes were included in the list, but its performance dropped\ncompared to Exomiser when more genes than 25 needed to be ranked.\nIn the case of ClinVar, we used the phenotypes from the HPO database as input\nfor each ranking problem; these phenotypes are identical to the phenotypes associ-\nated with the causative gene in the database used by Exomiser, and this may bias the\nresults. Therefore, we also used genotypes with their clinical phenotypes recorded in\nthe PAVS database for evaluation. Table5 shows the results. In the PAVS dataset, phe-\nnotypes do not match exactly with phenotypes in Exomiser’s genotype-to-phenotype\ndatabase and GPT-4 performed better than all other methods in ranking genes,\ndemonstrating that it is more robust to noisy phenotype descriptions than methods\nbased on semantic similarity and explicit genotype-to-phenotype databases.\n3.3 LLMs reveal candidate genes for undiagnosed cases\nWe assessed the performance of LLM-based ranking of genes using a cohort of 32\nfamilies each with at least one individual with undiagnosed likely genetic disease. All\naffected individuals were seen at King Khalid University Hospital (KKUH) in Riyadh,\nSaudi Arabia, and whole genome sequencing was performed for affected individuals\nand their family members (see Methods). Neither genetic nor phenotype data for\nthese families is publicly available or published; consequently, these cases represent a\nchallenging “unseen” test case for the utility of LLMs in identifying causative genes\nin rare genetic diseases. The variants identified after whole genome sequencing were\nfiltered by family pedigree, and suspected mode of inheritance, and allele frequency to\nretain only rare variants, and filter for potentially impactful variants (see Methods).\nAfter these filtering steps, the number of variants left in affected individuals ranged\nbetween one and 215 (mean 51.90), and these variants affected between one and 161\n(mean 37.97) genes.\nWe used the genes with a potentially impactful variant after all filtering steps\nas the list of genes to rank, and the phenotypes observed clinically for each family\nas phenotypes, and used either the zero-shot or single-shot chain-of-thought prompt\nevaluated earlier. Based on our performance evaluation, we applied only GPT-4 to\nthis cohort.\nAll 32 families underwent a detailed analysis to assess the biological and clinical\nplausibility of the top five candidate gene predictions. We assessed whether the top\n13\n .

This assessment, while\nexpert, is inevitably subjective. It took into account existing evidence that the gene\nhad already been associated with a closely related phenotypic description presented\nin the case in a genotype-to-phenotype database; evidence for loss or gain of function\nof a gene giving rise to at least two of the phenotypes or phenotype domains seen\nin the family (for example delay in speech acquisition was regarded as an example\nof developmental delay and therefore closely related); concordance of gene function\nor process, as described either by Gene Ontology [54] or in the literature, with the\nphenotypic description; phenotypic concordance with loss or gain of function of an\northolog in an experimental model; functional or etiological relationship between the\nphenotype of the patient and a gene–phenotype (e.g., vermis hypoplasia was regarded\nas closely associated with seizures/epilepsy or other neurodevelopmental disorders as\nthe two are closely linked). Given the large variation in the severity and spectrum of\ndisease manifestations in many rare diseases [55], it was important to assess biological\nplausibility rather than scoring precise and complete phenotype matches.\nWe assessed the top five ranked genes for each of the 32 families. Candidates were\ndelivered for all but one case where GPT-4 failed to rank. Of these, 15 families received\nat least one gene with a plausibility score of 4 or 5, and 23 genes were deemed plausible\na total of 155 scored. Candidate genes had 212 OMIM Phenotype-Gene relationships\n(Phenotype-MIM number; some genes have more than one Phenotype-MIM record)\nbut only 15 candidates had these previously asserted associations scored as the most\nplausible candidate. This was either due to very partial concordance of phenotypes\n– e.g. no more than one phenotype in common, irrelevant or discordant phenotypes,\nor differing modes of inheritance in combination with one of the above conditions. So\na candidate with only one of the phenotypes of the OMIM allele recapitulated, and\na recessive rather than dominant mode of inheritance would be regarded as a worse\nmatch. However, in the case of a good phenotype concordance and a discordant mode\nof inheritance, a lower match score was awarded on the premise that some alleles\nwith different inheritance patterns might not have been previously described; generally\nscored a 4 or 3. There was no clear relationship between the quality of the explanation\nand the plausibility of the candidate (see below).\n3.4 Explanations, hallucinations, and reproducibility\nOne of the advantages of LLMs in variant- and gene-prioritization is that they can\nnot only perform the ranking of genes but can also provide explanations for the ranks\nassigned. However, due to the statistical nature of LLMs, they may also provide output\nthat is factually incorrect, irrelevant, or inconsistent; we collectively refer to these\noutputs as “hallucinations”.\nThe first type of hallucination we observed was when the ranked list of genes\nincluded genes that were not specified as input, omitted genes that were provided as\ninput, or contained duplicates (Table 6). We found that all LLMs we evaluated would\noften (in up to 56% of cases) remove genes from the list to rank, therefore not ranking\nall genes provided as input. Less frequently, LLMs also added new genes to the list\nto rank. Overall, we found that GPT-4 was more reliable than the other LLMs we\n14\n .

Hallucinations included those that gave an inap-\npropriate response, ones that gave an irrelevant response, and the ones that seemed\ntrue and were convincing, but had no basis in fact. The latter kind of hallucination\nis potentially of the highest concern because it is challenging to detect and usually,\nrequires expert review of available sources and literature.\nWe manually reviewed the quality of the explanation given by the LLM for its\nchoices of the top five gene candidates for 32 families from our rare disease cohort. In\nsome cases, the LLM gave a single global explanation which was often very general\nand factually correct but uninformative. In other cases, specific reasons were given for\neach gene.\nWe assessed the explanations provided in terms of their truthfulness, informative-\nness, completeness, and relevance. Truthfulness was assessed by whether the statement\nwas factually true and could be substantiated with facts or reasonable inferences from\nfacts. Informativeness was assessed on how much useful, relevant, or novel information\nwas conveyed by the explanation. Completeness describes whether the explanation\nprovides a rationale for all aspects of the patient phenotype. Relevance was assessed\nby the degree to which the explanation for gene association was biologically or clini-\ncally relevant to the phenotypes. A summary of results using a scoring ranging from\n0 (very poor by the above criteria) to 5 (excellent, or, in the case of candidate genes,\na very plausible suggestion) is available as Supplementary Data (KSUFamilies.xlsx).\nOur results show that most explanations were factually correct (Truthfulness: mean:\n3.8, SD: 1.9), although usually uninformative (Informativeness: mean: 2 .2, SD: 1.6)\nand incomplete (Completeness: mean 1.8, SD: 1.4), and often not relevant to the phe-\nnotypes observed (Relevance: mean 2.1, SD: 1 .8). We also ranked plausibility for the\ngene being causative of the phenotypes; overall, across the top five genes, plausibility\nhad a mean of 1.6 (SD: 1.7). However, if we only consider the highest-scoring gene\namong the five genes we evaluated, the mean plausibility is 3 .7 (SD: 1.2), and for 15\nfamilies out of 32, we identified at least one candidate scoring with a plausibility of 4\nor 5.\nWhile most explanations were truthful, there are some exceptions where we have\nbeen unable to identify evidence for the truth of the statements made. For example, in\na family where the affected individual has the phenotypes proteinuria, focal segmental\nglomerulonephritis, hypertension, absent patellae, hypoplastic nails, limited range of\nmotion of the knees, dysmorphic facial features, and growth parameters below the third\ncentile, and a suspected dominant mode of inheritance, GPR107 is the second-ranked\ncandidate gene and provided with the following explanation: “GPR107: This gene\nencodes a protein that is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. This\nprotein has been shown to be a receptor for the sugar glucose, and is widely expressed\nin the central nervous system. While not directly linked to the symptoms, it could\npotentially be involved due to its role in glucose metabolism.” It is true that GPR107\n15\n .

However, we\nhave been unable to find any evidence that it binds glucose. Therefore, while the\noverall assertion is largely true, the LLM has hallucinated a part of its explanation:\nGPR107 does not bind glucose. Furthermore, while there is a wide range of phenotypes\nreported, there is no clear common linkage to glucose metabolism and we consider this\nto be another type of hallucination, i.e., generation of an irrelevant response.\nWe observed a similar hallucination in another family where the affected individ-\nual has astigmatism, Legg-Perthes [57], intellectual disability, and short stature. The\nexplanation given for the top suggestion (SMPD3) is: “This gene is associated with\nLegg-Perthes disease, a condition that affects the hip joint in children and can lead\nto short stature.” While it is true that, in principle, a hip disorder can lead to short\nstature, there is no discoverable link between SMPD3 and Legg-Perthes disease, and\nthe disorder is primarily associated with Col2A1 ( OMIM:150600 [58]). It is, however,\ntrue that loss of function of the mouse ortholog gives rise to disproportionate dwarfism\n[59], which is in principle a match. However, there are no behavioural or ocular phe-\nnotypes in these mice. In this case, the LLM has made a partial connection with the\ngene and the phenotypes, but the assertion that it is known to be involved in Legg-\nPerthes disease is hallucinatory. In a third type of hallucination, GPT-4 invented a\nsyndrome, “TOR3A syndrome” with associated phenotypes bearing some relation to\nthose of the patient. We can find no reference in the literature to “TOR3A syndrome”\nbut TOR1A is associated with torsion dystonia [60]; OMIM: 128100. GPT-4 seems to\nhave associated the phenotype of one gene with another closely related in name and\nfunction. We have seen this problem several times. For example, MYH4 and MYH14,\nwhere MYH14 is associated with autosomal deafness (OMIM: 600652) which is part\nof the patient phenotype, but MYH4, the given candidate, has no association with\ndeafness that we can discover.\n16\n .

Phenotype-based methods for ranking candidate genes consist of\ntwo main components: a knowledge-base of genotype-to-phenotype relations, and a\nsimilarity measure [17]. Often, they also contain structured background knowledge\nabout how phenotypes are related, usually in the form on a phenotype ontology\n[20], and use a similarity measure based on the background knowledge making it a\nsemantic similarity measure [19]. To perform better than phenotype-based gene prior-\nitization methods, LLMs need to be able to replace these two main components. LLMs\nobtain their background knowledge from literature; the content of most genotype-\nto-phenotype databases will at least to large parts be reported in the literature (for\nexample in the form of clinical case report [61]), and from our results, we can observe,\nsimilar to results in other clinical domains [24], that LLMs are as good or better in\nextracting the relevant information. LLMs also seem to be able to compute similar-\nity between phenotypes as well or better than the custom-built similarity measures in\nExomiser, demonstrated in particularly when using clinical phenotype descriptions as\ninput to the ranking model (Table 5).\nLLMs are very flexible in the input they take; in particular, LLMs can use arbitrary\ntext as input, and we demonstrated this in one of our datasets which is not based on\nthe HPO as vocabulary. However, in all experiments, we used only natural language\nlabels as input to the LLM whereas the baseline methods implemented by Exomiser\nuse HPO codes as input. In the past, the biomedical research community has made\nsignificant efforts in designing and developing phenotype ontologies [62], and in partic-\nular the HPO [16] has been developed to enable interoperability and applications such\nas candidate gene prioritization. Our results demonstrate that structured phenotypes\nare not required for the task of candidate gene prioritization and may actually be a\nlimiting factor in their success, either due to incomplete or inaccurate information in\nontologies that leads to incorrect entailments [63], or due to limitations in how much\ninformation can be expressed by a formal language like HPO in contrast to natural\nlanguage such as used as input to LLMs. While our results apply only to one of the\nmany applications of phenotype ontologies, in the future, their use and benefit should\nbe re-evaluated in particular regarding the cost of developing and maintaining ontolo-\ngies versus the availability of highly developed LLMs able to perform many different\ntasks.\nOur experiments also show that LLMs go beyond gene prioritization systems in\nthat they can provide explanations for their results. Furthermore, LLMs also have the\npotential to refine and update ranking results interactively. The best use of LLMs may\ntherefore be not as a simply ranking system but rather as an interactive diagnostic\nassistant. However, future work still needs to address “hallucinations” as well as ways\nto quantify uncertainty; knowledge graphs and ontologies may provide ways to solve\nthe problem of hallucination [64, 65] by providing structured knowledge.\nOne potential limitation of our study is that the LLM models we evaluate were\ntrained on text (i.e., literature articles) that report variants in our testing set.

We tried to control for\nthis by including in our evaluation only variants after the knowledge cut-off date of\nGPT-4. However, in the future, a prospective study using LLMs for the diagnosis of\ngenetic disease, based on our findings regarding variance in results, prompt design,\nor hallucinations should be designed. Such a prospective study could also investi-\ngate the use of LLMs for non-coding variants or structural variants which we did\nnot consider here, and evaluate ways to include structured background knowledge for\nknowledge-enhanced learning.\nSupplementary information.\nAcknowledgments.

In the case\nof not enough information, still try to rank these genes by using function, site of\nexpression or information from animal models.\nQ4 one-shot,\nchain-of-\nthought\nRole: You are an automated ranking system. You take a set of patient signs\nand symptoms (phenotypes) as input, as well as a set of genes in which a likely\npathogenic variant has been identified using a bioinformatics system. You return\na ranked list of genes according to the likelihood of the damaging variant in the\ngene causing the phenotypes of the patient. To do the ranking, first identify if\nthere is any knowledge about mutations in the gene causing the same or sim-\nilar phenotypes as observed in the patient. Use information about disease and\nphenotypes, animal models, gene functions, and anatomical site of expression.\nAutomatically rank all genes on the last rank if no evidence exists, and rank all\nother genes based on the likelihood of causing the phenotypes. Your ranked list\nshould include only the user provided genes and not any other gene. Example:\nA female patient who is suspected of having a genetic disease, presented with\nthese clinical symptoms: “Recurrent urticaria”, “Recurrent abdominal pain”,\n“Fatigue”, “Fever”, “arthralgia”, “Lymphadenopathy”, “Elevated circulating C-\nreactive protein”, “Glomerulonephritis”, “Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation\nrate”, “Anemia”.
