  "abstract": "The tomato holds significant global significance as a crop, fulfilling crucial roles in agriculture and meeting essential human dietary requirements.The persistent presence of diseases poses a significant risk to tomato crops, compromising their productivity and economic viability.This study presents a novel approach that combines the vision transformer (ViT) with deep neural networks (DNN) to identify tomato leaf diseases.This research aims to develop a methodology for identifying tomato leaf diseases, specifically focusing on enhancing the model's performance and interpretability.The proposed technique integrates an improved multi-head self attention mechanism with L1-norm attention, enhancing its ability to capture essential image features.The capability of ViT to process images as sequences of patches is harnessed and integrated with the interpretative and classifying prowess of DNN.To train and test the model, we utilize a comprehensive dataset of 18,160 tomato leaf images classified into ten different disease types.According to the experimental findings, the proposed model achieved an exceptional accuracy rate of 99.74%.The proposed method surpasses other contemporary techniques in terms of both accuracy and precision (99.66%), recall (99.39%), and F1-score (99.53%) for disease classification.The model's exceptional performance highlights its potential for practical implementation in diagnosing tomato diseases.In conclusion, this study presents a novel and efficient method for detecting tomato leaf diseases, which fulfills the current agricultural need for scalable and precise techniques.The fusion of vision transformers and deep neural networks offers a robust solution with exceptional accuracy and interpretability, contributing to the sustainable cultivation of this crucial crop.",
