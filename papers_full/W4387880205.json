    "abstract": "In recent years, research on emotion recognition has become more and more popular, but there are few studies on emotion recognition based on cerebral blood oxygen signals. Since the electroencephalogram (EEG) is easily disturbed by eye movement and the portability is not high, this study uses a more comfortable and convenient functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) system to record brain signals from participants while watching three different types of video clips. During the experiment, the changes in cerebral blood oxygen concentration in the 8 channels of the prefrontal cortex of the brain were collected and analyzed. We processed and divided the collected cerebral blood oxygen data, and used multiple classifiers to realize the identification of the three emotional states of joy, neutrality, and sadness. Since the classification accuracy of the convolutional neural network (CNN) in this research is not significantly superior to that of the XGBoost algorithm, this paper proposes a CNN-Transformer network based on the characteristics of time series data to improve the classification accuracy of ternary emotions. The network first uses convolution operations to extract channel features from multi-channel time series, then the features and the output information of the fully connected layer are input to the Transformer netork structure, and its multi-head attention mechanism is used to focus on different channel domain information, which has better spatiality. The experimental results show that the CNN-Transformer network can achieve 86.7% classification accuracy for ternary emotions, which is about 5% higher than the accuracy of CNN, and this provides some help for other research in the field of emotion recognition based on time series data such as fNIRS.",
