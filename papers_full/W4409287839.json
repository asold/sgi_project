  "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. However, they are inherently constrained by the static nature of their pretraining data, leading to challenges such as knowledge obsolescence, hallucination, and limited factual grounding. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm that addresses these limitations by dynamically integrating external knowledge retrieval with generative text modeling. By retrieving relevant documents or structured knowledge at inference time, RAG enhances model reliability, improves factual accuracy, and enables real-time knowledge adaptation.This survey provides a comprehensive overview of RAG, covering its foundational principles, retrieval mechanisms, generative strategies, and integration methodologies. We discuss various retrieval approaches, including sparse and dense retrieval, hybrid search models, and reinforcement learning-based retrieval optimization. We explore different fusion techniques for incorporating retrieved knowledge into generation, such as prompt concatenation, attention-based integration, and iterative refinement. Additionally, we examine the diverse applications of RAG across domains such as open-domain question answering, conversational AI, scientific literature summarization, code generation, legal document analysis, and biomedical research.Despite its advantages, RAG introduces new challenges, including retrieval noise, latency constraints, security vulnerabilities, and bias in retrieved content. We highlight key research directions to address these challenges, including scalable retrieval architectures, multimodal knowledge integration, continual learning for adaptive retrieval, and bias-aware ranking techniques. Furthermore, we discuss the broader implications of RAG in enabling explainable AI, bridging structured and unstructured knowledge sources, and democratizing access to real-time information.By synthesizing recent advancements and outlining future research opportunities, this survey serves as a foundational resource for researchers and practitioners working on retrieval-augmented systems. As RAG continues to evolve, it is poised to redefine the landscape of AI-driven text generation, paving the way for more accurate, interpretable, and knowledge-aware artificial intelligence systems.",
