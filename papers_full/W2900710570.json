The 22 \nrepeated use of other individuals as social tools may represent a complex social skill linked to  23 \nMachiavellian intelligence. 24 \n 25 \nKeywords: social tool use, chimpanzee, exploitation, Machiavellian intelligence  26 \n2 \n \nIntroduction 27 \nMany animals live , at least during some stage of their lives, in groups, ranging from loose and open 28 \naggregations to highly complex and closed societies (e.g., Krause & Ruxton, 2002) . Although group 29 \nliving is associated with several benefits including increased foraging success (Beauchamp, 1998) , 30 \npredator safety (Lehtonen & Jaatinen, 2016) , thermal protection (Gilbert et al., 2006)  and energy 31 \nsavings (Herskin & Steffensen, 1998), it does not come without costs. For instance, group-living animals 32 \nface increased food (Janson, 1988)  and mate competition (Wedell, Gage, & Parker, 2002) , risk of 33 \ndisease transmission (Côté & Poulin, 1994) and infanticide (Crockett & Janson, 2000). Complex social 34 \nenvironments are characterised by a fine balance of competition and cooperation  with multiple 35 \nindividuals interacting repeatedly over time in a variety of contexts , a setting that stands in stark 36 \ncontrast to the conditions operating in anonymous aggregations (Dunbar, 1998; see also  Fischer, 37 \nFarnworth, Sennhenn-Reulen, & Hammerschmidt, 2017). It has been hypothesised that the particular 38 \nchallenges of complex social environments select for advanced socio-cognitive skills (Chance & Mead, 39 \n1953; Humphrey, 1976; Jolly, 1966).  40 \nThe Machiavellian Intelligence Hypothesis (MIH), sometimes referred to as the “social complexity 41 \nhypothesis”, proposes that social competition within a social group is one of the main drivers for 42 \ncognitive skills used to manipulate conspecifics to the benefit of the actor (Byrne & Whiten, 1988) . 43 \nAlthough in some of their writings Whiten and Byrne (1988) mentioned both cooperation and 44 \ncompetition as drivers of social intelligence, the adjective that they chose to describe their hypothesis 45 \n(Machiavellian) paired with their empirical focus on tactical deception, largely explain why this 46 \nhypothesis has become associated with social competition, and more specifically with the exploitation 47 \nof conspecifics. 48 \nA far less subtle way to manipulate others than tactical deception, but still within the MIH’s purview, 49 \ninvolves using conspecifics as social tools. The meaning of social tool use, however, varies considerably 50 \nacross authors. Some researchers have defined “social tool” to denote cases where one animal 51 \n3 \n \ninteracts with a partner to influence a third party, such as in coalitionary support or agonistic buffering 52 \n(Johnson & Oswald, 2001). For instance, male Barbary macaques steal unweaned infants and use them 53 \nas protection shields, e.g. agonistic buffers, to avoid aggressive encounters by other males (Deag & 54 \nCrook, 1971). Other authors have used the term social tool use to refer to the use of physical objects 55 \nin social contexts, such as using a branch to display (Bard, 1990). We prefer to use the term social tool 56 \nuse in a narrower sense, to denote cases in which social agents physically coerce others to recruit their 57 \nhelp (see also Gómez, 1990). This definition is comparable to physical tool use, which might be defined 58 \nas “the exertion of control over a freely manipulable external object (the tool) with the goal of (1) 59 \naltering the physical properties of another object, substance, surface o r medium (the target, which 60 \nmay be the tool user or another organism) via a dynamic mechanical interaction, or (2) mediating the 61 \nflow of information between the tool user and the environment or other organisms in the 62 \nenvironment” (St Amant & Horton, 2008). 63 \nOur narrower definition of social tool use fits the exploitative dimension of the MIH and it can take on 64 \nseveral forms depending on the level of control between the user and its social tools (Völter, Rossano, 65 \n& Call, 2015, 2016). Level 1 describes situations in which the social tool is under full control of the user 66 \nand is treated like a physical object. In level 2 , the social tool user still has power over the social tool, 67 \nbut a response of the social tool is required, which cannot be fully controlled by the user. In level 3, 68 \nthe user relies on the self-initiated action by the social tool and thus control is further reduced. Finally, 69 \nin level 4 the user requests help from the social tool and as such it is mediated by communicative acts 70 \n(see also Gómez, 1990). While level 1 of social tool use is independent of a social tool’s response, the 71 \nother levels demand a coerced response of the social tool , which differs from physical tool use . 72 \nTherefore, levels 2-4 are impossible to achieve with static physical tools. 73 \nSocial tool use has not been often described in the literature and it is far less common than physical 74 \ntool use, given the frequent reports of the l atter (e.g., Shumaker, Walkup, & Beck, 2011) . Still, there 75 \nare some reports of social tool use among non-human primates. Sumatran orang-utan mothers (Pongo 76 \nabelii) used their immature offspring to retrieve food by actively pushing them towards out -of-reach 77 \n4 \n \nfood, which they eventually steal from their infants in an experimental study (Völter et al., 2015) . In 78 \nthe same experimental setting chimpanzee ( Pan troglodytes ) and bonobo ( Pan paniscus ) mothers 79 \nallowed their offspring to eat the retrieved food without any harassment or stealing attempts (Völter 80 \net al., 2016). A similar case of social tool use was reported in free-ranging Japanese macaques (Macaca 81 \nfuscata): three females used their infants to cli mb into a pipe to collect apple slices , which were 82 \nafterwards solely eaten by the mothers (Tokida, Tanaka, Takefushi, & Hagiwara, 1994).  83 \nBecause the benefits of exploiting others lead to success by gaining resources or mates, they ultimately 84 \ntranslate into increased fitness. Therefore, such skills are expected to evolve readily (Gavrilets & Vose, 85 \n2006). In addition , if one individual uses a strategy to exploit others, they are expected to develop 86 \ncounter strategies, leading to constant feedback loops as has been detected for some cases of tactical 87 \ndeception (e.g., Coussi-Korbel & Fragaszy, 1995;  Hirata & Matsuzawa, 2001; Menzel, 1974; see also 88 \nByrne & Whiten, 1992) . One strategy, which could enable the repeated exploitation of others, is to 89 \nprovide them with some form of benefit, such as grooming or social play, which in turn may reduce 90 \ncounter strategies.  Eventually, this spiralling effect may lead to more and more complex skills both 91 \nduring ontogeny and phylogeny (cf. Fisher, 1915). Finally, this process leads to superior socio-cognitive 92 \nskills in species living in complex social environments (as defined earlier) compared to species living in 93 \nsimpler social environments. 94 \nIn the present study, we report a spontaneously occurring example of social tool use in chimpanzees. 95 \nBy analysing these spontaneous occurrences of social tool use in chimpanzees, we aimed to shed new 96 \nlight on an aspect of the MIH that has received relatively little attention. Although cases of social tool-97 \nuse in non-human animals are witnessed occasionally (Melis, pers. comm.; Hopkins, pers. comm.), they 98 \nare rarely studied systematically. We think that a careful quantification of th ose data as well as a 99 \nprecise description of the conditions in which they occurred are essential to advancing our knowledge 100 \nin this area. Thus, we here document the manipulative actions of an adult male chimpanzee towards 101 \nthree group members. In addition, we investigated the success and development of such manipulative 102 \nacts over time. Furthermore, we investigated  whether the social tool user  showed a preference for 103 \n5 \n \nusing particular individuals over others and whether the “social tools” differed in their response to the 104 \nmanipulations. Finally, we recorded social play during and shortly after social tool use to test for a 105 \npossible association between exploiting others and providing them with benefits. We recorded social 106 \nplay because (i) other candidate behaviours, i.e. grooming, were rarely seen in this context and (ii) 107 \nsocial play sometimes transformed into social tool use. 108 \n 109 \nMethods 110 \nSubjects and study site 111 \nThe study was conducted in 2017 at the Chimfunshi Wildlife Orphanage Trust, which is a chimpanzee 112 \nsanctuary located in Northwestern Zambia. At this time, the sanctuary hosted 119 chimpanzees  that 113 \nlived in several groups comprised of wild -born and sanctuary-born individuals. They were housed in 114 \nenclosures of sizes up to 77 hectares, surrounded by electric fences . During feeding times (2 hours a 115 \nday), chimpanzees were called into indoor handling facilities with several rooms and were provided 116 \nwith nshima balls (maze flour cooked with water) and local seasonal fruits and vegetables. Outside of 117 \nthe feeding time, the individuals were able to freely range in their enclosures. 118 \nThis study made use of a spontaneously occurring behaviour by one individual of `group 4’, with which 119 \nwe conducted the fruit juice experiment (see below). This group consisted of 11 individuals, housed in 120 \na 25-hectare outdoor enclosure (SI tab. 1 for more information on the group members). The social tool 121 \nuser was a mid-ranking adult male, named Bobby. He was born in the wild, approximately in 1993. In 122 \n2000, he was rescued from being a tourist attraction in a restaurant in the Central African Republic , 123 \nwhere he daily interacted with many tourists. When he arrived in Chimfunshi he was in good physical 124 \ncondition. 125 \nApparatus 126 \nThe setup consisted of a drinking fountain, two retractable buttons that were installed in the enclosure 127 \nand a tank containing juice placed on top of the feeding house outside of the enclosure (fig. 1). The 128 \n6 \n \nbuttons were connected underground via hosepipes to the fountain . T he experimenters could 129 \nmanipulate the buttons from outside the enclosure. The buttons were only present during the testing 130 \nsessions. 131 \nProcedure 132 \nBefore each session, the experimenter flushed some juice through the fountain to signal the start of 133 \nthe session. Thereafter, the chimpanzees needed to push the two buttons simultaneously to delive r 134 \njuice to the distant fountain, from which others could drink. The setup created a dilemma because the 135 \npushers could not directly drink from the fountain because the flow of juice stopped as soon as the 136 \nbuttons were released. In prior experiments, the chimpanzees had already learned to push a single 137 \nbutton that released juice at a juice fountain (van Leeuwen et al., in prep.) , however they had never 138 \nbeen confronted with a condition in which two buttons needed to be pushed simultaneously to release 139 \njuice. 140 \nData coding and analyses 141 \nWe conducted 49 sessions lasting between 1 and 2 hours each. We videotaped all sessions with 142 \ncamcorders (JVC -Everio) obtaining a total of 90 hours of video footage. During the sessions, the 143 \nexperimenters, who were present at all times, noted down the social tool use events. The start of each 144 \nsequence was defined by the first occurrence of any behaviour that was involve d in increasing the 145 \nchance for receiving juice through the social tool user. Each sequence was stopped at 5 minutes after 146 \nthe last social tool use attempt. Afterwards these sequences were extracted using the VLC media 147 \nplayer. The respective sequences were coded using Solomon Coder (version 17.03.22). A second coder 148 \nindependently scored 20% of the videos to assess inter -observer reliability. We chose the videos 149 \nrandomly, but we ensured that videos from the beginning and end of the testing period were included 150 \nin the subset. We tested for reliability by calculating the Cohen’s Kappa for count data. Scores given to 151 \nthe social tool user and the social tools by the two observers were highly correlated (F-test: F63= 12.3, 152 \np< 0.0001) with a Cohen’s Kappa of 0.85 and a 95% confidence interval of 0.14. 153 \n7 \n \nWe scored the behaviour of the social tool user and the responses of the social tools. Table 1 provides 154 \na detailed description of the behaviours (see also the video included in the supplementary material).  155 \nAdditionally, we scored the social tool user’s success and his control over the social tools. 156 \nBehaviour of the s ocial tool use r: First, we identified and described the behaviour by the social tool 157 \nuser (Bobby [24 years old at the time of data collection]) towards his three social tools (Jack [9 years 158 \nold], Jewel [4 years old] and Kenny [6 years old] ). Because Jack was involved in only one case, we 159 \nexcluded him from further analyses. We recorded the durations of all behaviours, which highly 160 \ncorrelated with its frequency (see SI) and hence we report statistical analysis on the count data. The 161 \nfirst attempt to use one of the social tools was recorded in session 12. We analysed whether the levels 162 \nof social tool use differed over time using zero-inflated regression models for count data, which 163 \naccount for behavioural data that include zeros. We included the respective social tool use behaviours 164 \nas response variables (one model for each behaviour) and included the session number and social tool 165 \nidentity as explanatory variables. We assumed a negative binomial distribution and only report results 166 \nfrom models with a non-significant theta value, indicating an appropriate fit of the model (Zuur, Ieno, 167 \nWalker, Saveliev, & Smith, 2009). 168 \nWe also recorded any playful behaviour between the user and his social tools during the time from the 169 \nfirst element of social tool use until 5 minutes after the last element. Rough and tumble play was 170 \ndefined according to Nishida, Kano, Goodall, McGrew, & Nakamura, 1999 as a physical social play that 171 \nincludes: tag, wrestle, push, pull, bite,  drag, stamp, slap, thrust and  leap. Importantly, all these 172 \nbehaviours occurred in proximity to the experimental device but were not directed to it, as for instance 173 \npushing the  social tool into the direction of the butto ns. We tested whether the two social tools 174 \ndiffered in their duration of playing with the social tool user by using a Mann-Whitney-U-test. 175 \nSuccess of the social tool use r: We determined the success of the user ’s strategy by calculating the 176 \nincrease of juice donations by comparing the coerced and uncoerced donations by the two social tools, 177 \nKenny and Jewel. We defined a coerced pushing event as Bobby pushing or herding the social tool 178 \n8 \n \ntowards the buttons and all following pressing events without the social tool distancing itself from  179 \nbuttons by more than 3 meters. All other pushing events  were defined as uncoerced , in which the 180 \nsocial tools approached the buttons alone and had not been harassed by Bobby immediately before. 181 \nIn addition, we report the overall drinking rate, standardised by time of observations, before and after 182 \nBobby used social tools. 183 \nControl over social tool: Social tools could either press the buttons or try to escape by running away or 184 \navoiding the buttons after a social tool use attempt. Hence, we recorded in how many trials the social 185 \ntool user responded to an escape by either retrieving or pushing the social tool back into the direction 186 \nof the buttons. We consider a behaviour to be a response by the actor to an escape attempt, if the 187 \nuser responded within 60 seconds of the beginning of the escape attempt. 188 \nResponse of social tools: We recorded the response of the social tools, namely whether they pressed 189 \nthe buttons and the latency until the behaviour was executed. We tested whether the two social tools 190 \ndiffered in their response by using a Generalised Linear Mixed Model with Poisson error distribution 191 \nand log link function . We included how often  the social tools pressed the buttons as a r esponse 192 \nvariable, the social tool identity (Jewel or Kenny) as an explanatory variable  and the session number 193 \nas random effect . The model did not show overdispersion, indicating an appropriate fit (Crawley, 194 \n2007). Furthermore, we tested whether the social tools differed in their response when being coerced 195 \nto help by performing a Generalised Linear Mixed Model with a binomial error distribution and logit 196 \nlink function . We included the social tools’ response (escape or press the buttons) as a binomial 197 \nresponse variable into the model with two random effects, which were the social tool identity and the 198 \nsession number. Finally, we tested whether the time to press the button  by the social tools is 199 \ndependent on the user’s gestures by calculating a survival analysis. We included “the time interval 200 \nbetween Bobby pushing the social tool until the social tool pressed the buttons” as response variable. 201 \nWe included the information of whether Bobby reached out during the time interval. To correct for 202 \nthe different social tools, we included them as a random factor. 203 \n9 \n \nAll statistical analyses and graphs were performed in R (version 3.4.2, http://www.r-project.org; with 204 \nR studio and packages ‘lme4’, ‘ggplot2’, ‘cowplot’, ‘pscl, ‘Hmisc’, ‘irr’, and ‘survival’). Because the data 205 \nwere not normally distributed, we report non-parametric tests throughout the manuscript (see SI). 206 \nEthical statement 207 \nOur study was approved by the ethics committee of the host sanctuary (the Chimfunshi Research 208 \nAdvisory Board). All chimpanzees participated voluntarily in the project. The chimpanzees were never 209 \nfood or water deprived, nor were any chimpanzees separated from their group at any time. In addition, 210 \nthe animals were constantly monitored during all sessions and if any deviant behaviour or unexpected 211 \nphysical reaction had occurred, the experiments could have been stopped immediately, which was not 212 \nthe case. Finally, we adhered to the legal requirements of  the Zambia Wildlife Authority (ZAWA) and 213 \nthe Ethical Treatment of Nonhuman Primates guidelines by the International Prima tological Society's 214 \nPrinciples. 215 \n 216 \nResults 217 \nBehaviour and success of the social tool user 218 \nWe recorded 146 instances of the tool user (Bobby) actively pushing one of the three social tools into 219 \nthe direction of the buttons that could be used to induce juice flow (Kenny= 118, Jewel= 26, Jack= 2). 220 \nIn 78 cases , Bobby  retrieved Kenny ( 73) and Jewel ( 5) from a distance of more than 3 meters 221 \n(sometimes from more than 10 meters) before directing them to the buttons. While sitting in front of 222 \nthe fountain, Bobby held his hand out to  Kenny and Jewel in 19 and 11 times, respectively. Bobby 223 \ntypically blew raspberries while he displayed these behaviours. In all of the cases, retrieving and 224 \npushing the social tools occurred before reaching out or blowing raspberries. The juveniles provided 225 \njuice to Bobby in 115 cases (Kenny= 70, Jewel= 45), which includes cases where the social tools pressed 226 \nseveral times in response to Bobby’s actions.  227 \n10 \n \nBobby did not change his behaviour over time after he had started using the juveniles as tools (herding: 228 \nGLM: β= -0.02 ± 0.03, p= 0.50; pushing: GLM: β= -0.05 ± 0.03, p= 0.15; reaching out: GLM: β= 0.01 ± 229 \n0.03, p= 0.70; blowing raspberries: GLM: β= 0.01 ± 0.03, p= 0.83, fig. 2 a-d). Overall, he herded (GLM: 230 \nβ= 2.71 ± 1.17, p= 0.020, fig. 2 a) and pushed (GLM: β= 1.10 ± 0.44, p= 0.011, fig. 2 b) Kenny more often 231 \nthan Jewel. In contrast, reaching out was directed equally often at both juveniles (GLM: β= -0.38 ± 0.41, 232 \np= 0.36, fig. 2 c). Bobby’s actions were associated with play behaviour. Overall, Bobby and Kenny spent 233 \nmore time playing with each other than Jewel and Bobby (Mann-Whitney U test: W= 274.50, p= 0.002, 234 \nfig. S1). 235 \nKenny pressed the buttons 538 times over all sessions irrespectively for whom and Jewel pressed the 236 \nbuttons 1154 times. By coercing the juveniles, Bobby ’s success in obtaining juice increased 237 \nsubstantially (Kenny provided juice in 83 cases and Jewel in 54). Furthermore, after he started using 238 \nthe juveniles, his drinking bouts per hour increased from 0.53 to 5.01 (fig. S 2). Bobby got access to 239 \njuice not only by his soci al tools. However, he increased his juice intake by 48% through using social 240 \ntools. If the juveniles tried to escape, Bobby retrieved or pushed them back in 46% of the cases within 241 \na median response time of 10.2 seconds (IQR= 20.3). 242 \nResponse by the social tools 243 \nIn general, Kenny pressed the buttons for Bobby more often than Jewel after being harassed by Bobby 244 \n(GLMM: β= 0.44 ± 0.19, p= 0.021, fig. S3). We then tested whether one tool was more likely to respond 245 \nwith pressing the buttons than the other and found a non -significant trend that Jewel tended to 246 \nrespond more by pressing the buttons for Bobby than Kenny (GLMM: β= 0.68 ± 0.38, p= 0.075, fig. 3). 247 \nThe social tools’ latency to press the buttons was not influenced by Bobby reaching out to the social 248 \ntools (Proportional Hazards Regression Model: β= 0.10 ± 0.23, p= 0.66).  249 \n11 \n \nDiscussion 250 \nWe observed an adult male chimpanzee (Bobby) repeatedly using two juveniles (Kenny & Jewel) as 251 \nsocial tools to obtain juice (a third, 8-year-old juvenile was used only in one sequence). Bobby displayed 252 \nseveral behaviours aimed at enticing the juveniles to press a pair of buttons that activated a juice 253 \nfountain located 3 meters away from them. His behaviour varied in the level of control over the 254 \njuveniles. First, he actively re cruited them by rolling or dragging them towards the buttons. In those 255 \nsituations, the juveniles seldom had the chance to escape and were under Bobby’s almost full control 256 \nand in constant contact. Next, Bobby pushed the juveniles in the direction of the buttons. Because the 257 \nbuttons and the fountain were three meters apart, he had to release them in order to drink from the 258 \nfountain. Hence, his control was limited, and the juveniles could decide whether to press the buttons 259 \nor to escape. In the case of escaping, however, the social tool user successfully retrieved them in 260 \nalmost half of the cases, suggesting some form of control. Social tool use was accompanied by blowing 261 \nraspberries and reaching out. The latter was clearly directed towards the juveniles and might have 262 \nserved as begging, although it did not lead to a faster response by them. Blowing raspberries was not 263 \napparently directed at the juveniles given that it was sometimes emitted when Bobby was alone, and 264 \nthus might indicate a general state of arousal. 265 \nThe benefit for the adult male in using the juveniles was a marked increase in juice intake that persisted 266 \nover time. In contrast, juveniles received no juice in return for the ir efforts. In fact, Bobby 267 \nsystematically pushed them away from the fountain when they approached it. Moreover, we observed 268 \nno reciprocal turn-taking in pressing the buttons by Bobby and any of the juveniles because he never 269 \nsuccessfully pushed both button s and released juice from the fountain  in this study . This finding is 270 \nconsistent with other cases of social tool use in which a large power differential between mother -271 \noffspring dyads or even unrelated pairs of individuals determines the control exerted by the dominant 272 \nover the subordinate’s behaviour and the biased distribution of resources (Chalmeau, 1994; Tokida et 273 \nal., 1994; Völter et al., 2015) . However, social tool use does not always require a power asymmetry 274 \nbased on a large discrepancy in terms of age, status and body size. Chalmeau, Lardeux and Brandibas 275 \n12 \n \n(1997) reported social tool use between two orang-utans of approximately the same age. In addition 276 \nto work on primates, Tebbich, Taborsky and Winkler (1996) observed that dominant keas coerced 277 \nsubordinate individuals to sit on a seesaw to open a container with food for the user.  This study is 278 \nparticularly interesting because it shows that social tool use also occurs in non-primates. 279 \nOne puzzling result is that since the juveniles received no tangible benefit, one would have predicted 280 \nan overall decrease over time. If social tools started to avoid the user, there should be a decrease in 281 \nsocial tool use. This is precisely what Chalmeau (1994) observed in a dyad of chimpanzees, where the 282 \nharassed subordinate female escaped in most of th e cases, which led the user to use her less often 283 \nover time. In our case, we found no evidence that the user had to retrieve the social tools more often 284 \nby the end of the study, which might indicate that social tools started to avoid Bobby. The juveniles’ 285 \nparticipation is even more puzzling when one considers that the control exerted by Bobby also had its 286 \nlimits. We recorded two aggressive instances after the social tools shortly screamed while the user 287 \ntried to retrieve them after an escape attempt. In bot h cases, unrelated adult males rushed over and 288 \nthe tool user was readily displaced. In fact, V ölter and colleagues (2016) argued that social tool use 289 \nbetween mother-offspring dyads was more prevalent among orang-utans compared to chimpanzees 290 \nand bonobos, because chimpanzee and bonobo infants  protested more intensively , thus bringing 291 \nattention to this situation by other group members. The two cases that we observed, lend some 292 \nsupport to this interpretation. 293 \nOne way to characterize social tool use is in terms of exploitation, i.e., one partner benefits and the 294 \nother does not , despite the social tool’s  `costly’ participation. However, such characteri sation may 295 \noverlook that the juveniles may have actually obtained some benefit, such as play, which could explain 296 \nwhy they continued to allow themselves to be manipulated. This is of special interest considering the 297 \nlimits to the manipulation that Bobby could exert as indicated by the two aggressive incidents that we 298 \nobserved. To address this issue , we turn our attention to two questions: why Bobby targeted the 299 \njuveniles in the group and why the juveniles continued to participate in these episodes. 300 \n13 \n \nOne possibility is that Bobby focused on the juveniles instead of other group members because they 301 \nwere the lowest ranking members of the group, or perhaps the only ones that Bobby clearly outranked 302 \nin the group. In other words, Bobby may have tried to maximi se the power differential between him 303 \nand his social tools, a factor that is associated with social tool use in most studies. Because the action 304 \nof pressing the buttons cannot be fully controlled by the user, older group members might not be as 305 \neasily coerced as younger individuals and might put up a serious fight when being harassed. Another 306 \npossibility is that Bobby focused on the juveniles because their age made them more suitable for 307 \nphysical and motivational manipulation. Although this explanation partly overlaps with the previ ous 308 \none, it does not do so entirely. Compared to adult individuals, juveniles are more easily pushed and 309 \ndragged around, and they may offer less resistance to such invasive behaviour. 310 \nFrom a motivationally point of view, the juveniles may have tolerated the large asymmetry in juice 311 \nintake better than adults. In other words, adults may have been more likely than juveniles to expect a 312 \nshare of the resources. Male juveniles’ interest in associating with adult males (Pusey, 1990) and the 313 \nprevalence of play among immature individuals (Burghardt, 2005) may have further contributed to 314 \nmaking the juveniles particularly effective social tools. Although both juveniles pressed the buttons 315 \nregularly, Bobby preferred to use the older juvenile (Kenny) from whom he obtained more juice. This 316 \npreference cannot be explained by a greater success rate when Bobby tried to use Kenny because the 317 \nless used individual (Jewel) tended to respond more with pressing the buttons than escaping. In other 318 \nwords, 6-year-old Kenny seemed more compliant than 4-year-old Jewel. It is conceivable that a greater 319 \nmotivation to associate with adult males may explain the more frequent interactions between them 320 \nand, consequently, the more numerous attempts to use Kenny. Furthermore, Kenny and Bobby also 321 \nplayed more with each other during or shortly after social tool use. During those play episodes , both 322 \nBobby and his social tool displayed a play face. Play is a pleasurable and rewarding behaviour (Trezza, 323 \nBaarendse, & Vanderschuren, 2010) . The balance between playing and using the social tools might 324 \nexplain why the juveniles did not avoid Bobby over time. However, this hypothesis needs to be tested 325 \nin future studies. Moreover, whether play was a by-product of the increased association between the 326 \n14 \n \njuveniles and the adult male over time or a tactic deployed by Bobby to secure Kenny’s collaboration 327 \nis also an open question. If the latter were the case, this instrumental use of play would be comparable 328 \nto the cases of grooming directed to mothers to gain access to their infants that have been labelled as 329 \n`distraction’ in the tactical deception literature (Byrne & Whiten, 1988, 1992; Mitchell, 1988). 330 \nFuture studies on the development of social tool use could provide important insights into the causal 331 \nunderstanding of the social tool user and its action s. In theory,  three underlying mechanisms are 332 \npossible (cf. Seed & Byrne, 2010). First, social tool users could learn from others how to use social tools 333 \neffectively. Second, social tool users might learn via trial -and-error that the manipulation of others 334 \nlead to selfish benefits. Finally, social tool users might causally understand that a social tool is needed 335 \nto reach a certain goal. We think that in our case social learning is the least likely possibility because 336 \nBobby was the only individual showing this behaviour during the time of data collection. Whether he 337 \nfound social tool use as a solution to the  dilemma by insight  or trial and error is difficult to discern 338 \nwithout careful experimental manipulations of the context but it could be addressed in further studies. 339 \nWhile our case study consists of a sample size of only one social tool user and his three social tools, we 340 \nobtained the largest dataset to date, as far as we are aware, in terms of occurrences of this behaviour. 341 \nHowever, case studies like ours make generalisations difficult. For instance, the adult male was rescued 342 \nfrom mistreatment by humans, which may have resulted in an inability to interact appropriately with 343 \nconspecifics. However, the data available in the literature, particularly the studies focusing on mother-344 \noffspring pairs in apes and macaques, weaken this possibility considerably. Alt ernatively, social tool-345 \nuse might be restricted to fixed groups with no possibility to disperse, as in a sanctuary or laboratory 346 \nsettings. Data from field studies are needed to answer this question. 347 \nIn sum, we have shown that a chimpanzee spontaneously started using group members as social tools 348 \nunder semi-natural conditions. The tool user actively retrieved his social tools and pushed them to 349 \nbuttons that produced juice when pressed. Because pressing the buttons for his own benefit was not 350 \npossible, Bobby was dependent on others to press the buttons for him. Although the tool user did not 351 \n15 \n \nhave full control over the social tools, he was able to increase his juice intake almost 10 -fold. Playing 352 \nwith the social tools might have stabilised Bobby’s strategy over  time. The balance between using 353 \nothers for the actor’s own benefit and preventing the social tools from avoiding the actor might be an 354 \nexample of Machiavellian intelligence. Future studies are needed to understand how widespread social 355 \ntool use is in chim panzees and other species, and how the social and ecological settings affect its 356 \noccurrence. Such data will enable the systematic investigation of its origins and psychological 357 \nunderpinnings. 358 \n 359 \nAcknowledgements 360 \nWe would like to thank the Chimfunshi Wildlife  Orphanage Trust and all staff members for their 361 \nongoing support of our research.
