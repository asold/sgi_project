One of the most com-\nmonly used 3D data format is the point cloud, which re-\nquires less memory to store but convey detailed 3D shape\n*Equal contribution.\n†Corresponding author.\nIncomplete\nPoint cloud\nSet of\nPoints proxies\nGeomentary-aware\nTransformer\nSet of\nPredicted proxies\nComplete\nPoint cloud\nEncoder Decoder\nFigure 1: PoinTr is designed for point cloud completion task. It\ntakes the downsampled partial point clouds as inputs (gray points),\nand predicts the missing parts and upsamples the known parts si-\nmultaneously (blue points). We propose to formulate the point\ncloud completion task as a set-to-set translation task and use a\ntransformer encoder-decoder architecture to learn the complex de-\npendencies among the point groups. Furthermore, we design two\nnew benchmarks with more diverse tasks ( i.e., upsampling and\ncompletion of point cloud), more diverse categories ( i.e., from 8\ncategories to 55 categories), more diverse viewpoints (i.e., from 8\nviewpoints to all possible viewpoints) and more diverse levels of\nincompleteness (i.e., missing 25% to 75% points of the ground-\ntruth point clouds) to better reﬂect the real-world scenarios and\npromote future research.\ninformation. However, point cloud data from existing 3D\nsensors are not always complete and satisfactory because\nof inevitable self-occlusion, light reﬂection, limited sensor\nresolution, etc. Therefore, recovering complete point clouds\nfrom partial and sparse raw data becomes an indispensable\ntask with ever-growing signiﬁcance.\nOver the years, researchers have tried many approaches\nto tackle this problem in the realm of deep learning. Early\nattempts on point cloud completion [6, 15, 32, 33, 24, 38,\n20, 19, 53, 49, 42] try to migrate mature methods from 2D\n1\narXiv:2108.08839v1  [cs.CV]  19 Aug 2021\ncompletion tasks to 3D point clouds by voxelization and\n3D convolutions. However, these methods suffer from a\nheavy computational cost that grows cubically as the spa-\ntial resolution increases. With the success of PointNet and\nPointNet++ [27, 28], directly processing 3D coordinates\nbecomes the mainstream of point cloud based 3D anal-\nysis. The technique is further applied to many pioneer\nworks [1, 51, 37, 16, 23, 14, 31] in point cloud comple-\ntion task, in which an encoder-decoder based architecture is\ndesigned to generate complete point clouds. However, the\nbottleneck of such methods lies in the max-pooling opera-\ntion in the encoding phase, where ﬁne-grained information\nis lost and can hardly be recovered in the decoding phase.\nReconstructing complete point cloud is a challenging\nproblem since the structural information required in the\ncompletion task runs counter to the unordered and un-\nstructured nature of point cloud data. Therefore, learning\nstructural features and long-range correlations among lo-\ncal parts of the point cloud becomes the key ingredient to-\nwards better point cloud completion. In this paper, we pro-\npose to adopt Transformers [39], one of the most success-\nful architecture in Natural Language Processing (NLP), to\nlearn the structural information of pairwise interactions and\nglobal correlations for point cloud completion. Our model,\nnamed PoinTr, is characterized by ﬁve key components:\n1) Encoder-Decoder Architecture: We adopt the encoder-\ndecoder architecture to convert point cloud completion as\na set-to-set translation problem. The self-attention mech-\nanism of transformers models all pairwise interactions be-\ntween elements in the encoder, while the decoder reasons\nabout the missing elements based on the learnable pairwise\ninteractions among features of the input point cloud and\nqueries; 2) Point Proxy: We represent the set of point clouds\nin a local region as a feature vector called Point Proxy. The\ninput point cloud is convert to a sequence of Point Prox-\nies, which are used as the inputs of our transformer model;\n3) Geometry-aware Transformer Block: To facilitate trans-\nformers to better leverage the inductive bias about 3D ge-\nometric structures of point clouds, we design a geometry-\naware block that models the geometric relations explicitly;\n4) Query Generator : We use dynamic queries instead of\nﬁxed queirs in the decoder, which are generated by a query\ngeneration module that summarizes the features produced\nby the encoder and represents the initial sketch of the miss-\ning points; 5) Multi-Scale Point Cloud Generation: We de-\nvise a multi-scale point generation module to recover the\nmissing point cloud in a coarse-to-ﬁne manner.\nAs another contribution, we argue that existing bench-\nmarks are not representative enough to cover real-world sce-\nnarios of incompleted point clouds. Therefore, we intro-\nduce two more challenging benchmarks that contain more\ndiverse tasks (i.e., joint upsampling and completion of point\ncloud), more object categories (i.e., from 8 categories to 55\ncategories), more diverse views points ( i.e., from 8 view-\npoints to all possible viewpoints) and more diverse level\nof incompleteness ( i.e., missing 25% to 75% points of the\nground-truth point clouds). We evaluate our method on both\nthe new benchmarks and the widely used PCN dataset [51]\nand KITTI benchmark [10]. Experiments demonstrate that\nPointTr outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on\nall benchmarks by a large margin. The main contributions\nof this paper are summarized in Figure 1.\n2. Related Work\n3D Shape Completion.Traditional methods for 3D shape\ncompletion tasks often adopt voxel grids or distance ﬁelds\nto describe 3D objects [6, 15, 33]. Based on such structured\n3D representations, the powerful 3D convolutions are used\nand achieve a great success in the tasks of 3D reconstruc-\ntion [4, 11] and shape completion [6, 15, 46]. However, this\ngroup of methods suffers from heavy memory consump-\ntion and computational burden. Although these issues are\nfurther alleviated by methods based on sparse representa-\ntions [34, 41, 12], the quantization operation in these meth-\nods still cause a signiﬁcant loss in detailed information. Dif-\nferent from the above methods, researchers gradually start\nto use unstructured point clouds as the representation of 3D\nobjects, given the small memory consumption and strong\nability to represent ﬁne-grained details. Nevertheless, the\nmigration from structured 3D data understanding to point\nclouds analysis is non-trivial, since the commonly used con-\nvolution operator is no longer suitable for unordered points\nclouds. PointNet and its variants [27, 28] are the pioneer\nwork to directly process 3D coordinates and inspire the re-\nsearches in many downstream tasks. In the realm of point\ncloud completion, PCN [51] is the ﬁrst learning-based ar-\nchitecture, which proposes an Encoder-Decoder framework\nand adopts a FoldingNet to map the 2D points onto a 3D\nsurface by mimicking the deformation of a 2D plane. After\nPCN, many other methods [37, 16, 48, 18] spring up, pursu-\ning point clouds completion in higher resolution with better\nrobustness.\nTransformers. Transformers [39] are ﬁrst introduced as\nan attention-based framework in Natural Language Process-\ning (NLP). Transformer models often utilize the encoder-\ndecoder architecture and are characterized by both self-\nattention and cross-attention mechanisms. Transformer\nmodels have proven to be very helpful to the tasks that\ninvolve long sequences thanks to the self-attention mecha-\nnism. The cross-attention mechanism in the decoder exploit\nthe encoder information to learn the attention map of query\nfeatures, which making transformers powerful in generation\ntasks. By taking the advantages of both self-attention and\ncross-attention mechanisms, transformers have a strong ca-\npability to handle long sequence input and enhance infor-\nFPS\nIncompletePointCloud\nMLP\n…\n…Center Points\nPoints Proxies\n+\nFeatureExtractor\nPositionalEmbeddingGeometry-awareTransformerEncoder\nDynamicQueries\nGeometry-awareTransformerDecoder\n…\nQueryGenerator\n…\nPredictedCenters\nFoldingNet\nPredictedProxies\nPredictedMissingPointCloud\nFigure 2: The Pipeline of PoinTr.

In the past few years, transformers have dominated\nthe tasks that take long sequences as input and gradually re-\nplaced RNNs [40] in many domains. Now they begin their\njourney in computer vision [7, 22, 35, 29, 25, 30].\n3. Approach\nThe overall framework of PoinTr is illustrated in Fig-\nure 2. We will introduce our method in detail as follows.\n3.1. Set-to-Set Translation with Transformers\nThe primary goal of our method is to leverage the im-\npressive sequence-to-sequence generation ability of trans-\nformer architecture for point cloud completion tasks. We\npropose to ﬁrst convert the point cloud to a set of feature\nvectors, point proxies, that represent the local regions in the\npoint clouds (we will describe in Section 3.2). By anal-\nogy to the language translation pipeline, we model point\ncloud completion as a set-to-set translation task, where\nthe transformers take the point proxies of the partial point\nclouds as the inputs and produce the point proxies of the\nmissing parts. Speciﬁcally, given the set of point prox-\nies F = {F1, F2, ..., FN }that represents the partial point\ncloud, we model the process of point cloud completion as a\nset-to-set translation problem:\nV= ME(F), H= MD(Q, V), (1)\nwhere ME and MD are the encoder and decoder mod-\nels, V = {V1, V2, ..., VN }are the output features of the\nencoder, Q= {Q1, Q2, ..., QM }are the dynamic queries\nfor the decoder, H= {H1, H2, ..., HM }are the predicted\npoint proxies of the missing point cloud, andM is the num-\nber of the predicted point proxies. The recent success in\nNLP tasks like text translation and question answering [8]\nhave clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of transformers\nto solve this kind of problem. Therefore, we propose to\nadopt a transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture to\nsolve the point cloud completion problem.\nThe encoder-decoder architecture consists of LE and\nLD multi-head self-attention layers [39] in the encoder\nand decoder, respectively. The self-attention layer in the\nencoder ﬁrst updates proxy features with both long-range\nand short-range information. Then a feed forward network\n(FFN) further updates the proxy features with an MLP ar-\nchitecture. The decoder utilizes self-attention and cross-\nattention mechanisms to learn structural knowledge. The\nself-attention layer enhances the local features with global\ninformation, while the cross-attention layer explores the re-\nlationship between queries and outputs of the encoder. To\npredict the point proxies of the missing parts, we propose to\nuse dynamic query embeddings, which makes our decoder\nmore ﬂexible and adjustable for different types of objects\nand their missing information. More details about the trans-\nformer architecture can be found in the supplementary ma-\nterial and [8, 39].\nNote that beneﬁting from the self-attention mechanism\nin transformers, the features learned by the transformer net-\nwork are invariant to the order of point proxies, which is\nalso the basis of using transformers to process point clouds.\nConsidering the strong ability to capture data relationships,\nwe expect the transformer architecture to be a promising al-\nternative for deep learning on point clouds.\n3.2. Point Proxy\nThe Transformers in NLP take as input a 1D sequence of\nword embeddings [39]. To make 3D point clouds suitable\nfor transformers, the ﬁrst step is to convert the point cloud\nto a sequence of vectors. A trivial solution is directly feed-\ning the sequence of xyz coordinates to the transformers.\nHowever, since the computational complexity of the trans-\nformers is quadratic to the sequence length, this solution\nwill lead to an unacceptable cost. Therefore, we propose to\nrepresent the original point cloud as a set of point proxies.\nMulti-HeadSelf-Attention𝑉𝐾Q\nLinear kNNqueryLinearMaxPoolingConcatenateLinear\n𝑉𝑝! 𝑝\"\nResidual Connector𝑋#$%\n𝑋#\nMulti-HeadSelf-Attention𝑉𝐾Q\nLinearResidual Connector𝑋#$%\n𝑋#\nVanilla TransformerBlock Geometry-aware TransformerBlock\nFigure 3: Comparisons of the vanilla transformer block and the\nproposed geometry-aware transformer block.\nA point proxy represents a local region of the point clouds.\nInspired by the set abstraction operation in [28], we ﬁrst\nconduct furthest point sample (FPS) to locate a ﬁxed num-\nber N of point centers {q1, q2, ..., qN }in the partial point\ncloud. Then, we use a light-weight DGCNN [44] with hi-\nerarchical downsampling to extract the feature of the point\ncenters from the input point cloud. The point proxy Fi is\na feature vector that captures the local structure around qi,\nwhich can be computed as:\nFi = F′\ni + ϕ(qi), (2)\nwhere F′\ni is the feature of point qi that is extracted using\nthe DGCNN model, and ϕ is another MLP to capture the\nlocation information of the point proxy. The ﬁrst term rep-\nresents the semantic patterns of the local region, and the\nsecond term is inspired by the position embedding [3] oper-\nation in transformers, which explicitly encodes the global\nlocation of the point proxy. The detailed architecture of\nthe feature extraction model can be found in Supplementary\nMaterial.\n3.3. Geometry-aware Transformer Block\nOne of the key challenges of applying transformers for\nvision tasks is the self-attention mechanism in transformers\nlacks some inductive biases inherent to conventional vision\nmodels like CNNs and point cloud networks which explic-\nitly model the structures of vision data. To facilitate trans-\nformers to better leverage the inductive bias about 3D ge-\nometric structures of point clouds, we design a geometry-\naware block that models the geometric relations, which can\nbe a plug-and-play module to incorporate with the attention\nblocks in any transformer architectures. The details of the\nproposed block are shown in Figure 3. Different from the\nself-attention module that uses the feature similarity to cap-\nture the semantic relation, we propose to use kNN model\nto capture the geometric relation in the point cloud. Given\nthe query coordinates pQ, we query the features of the near-\nest keys according to the key coordinates pk. Then we fol-\nlow the practice of DGCNN [44] to learn the local geomet-\nric structures by feature aggregation with a linear layer fol-\nlowed by the max pooing operation. The geometric feature\nand semantic feature are then concatenated and mapped to\nthe original dimensions to form the output.\n3.4. Query Generator\nThe queries Qserve as the initial state of the predicted\nproxies. To make sure the queries correctly reﬂect the\nsketch of the completed point cloud, we propose a query\ngenerator module to generate the query embeddings dy-\nnamically conditioned on the encoder outputs. Speciﬁcally,\nwe ﬁrst summarize Vwith a linear projection to higher di-\nmensions followed by the max pooing operation. Similar\nto [51], we use a linear projection layer to directly gener-\nate M ×3 dimension features that can be reshaped as the\nM coordinates {c1, c2, ..., cM }. Lastly, we concatenate the\nglobal feature of the encoder and the coordinates, and use\nan MLP to produce the query embeddings.\n3.5. Multi-Scale Point Cloud Generation\nThe goal of our encoder-decoder network is to predict\nthe missing parts of incomplete point clouds. However, we\ncan only get predictions for missing proxies from the trans-\nformer decoder. Therefore, we propose a multi-scale point\ncloud generation framework to recover missing point clouds\nat full resolution. To reduce redundant computations, we\nreuse the M coordinates produced by the query generator\nas the local centers of the missing point cloud. Then, we\nutilize a FoldingNet [50] f to recover detailed local shapes\ncentered at the predicted proxies:\nPi = f(Hi) +ci, i = 1, 2, ..., M. (3)\nwhere Pi is the set of neighboring points centered at ci.\nFollowing previous work [16], we only predict the missing\nparts of the point cloud and concatenate them with the input\npoint cloud to obtain the complete objects. Both predicted\nproxies and recovered point clouds are supervised during\nthe training process, and the detailed loss function will be\nintroduced in the following section.\n3.6. Optimization\nThe loss function for point cloud completion should pro-\nvide a quantitative measurement for the quality of output.\nHowever, since the point clouds are unordered, many loss\nfunctions that directly measure the distance between two\npoints ( i.e. ℓ2 distance) are unsuitable. Fan et al . [9] in-\ntroduce two metrics that are invariant to the permutation\nof points, which are Chamfer Distance (CD) and Earth\nMover’s Distance (EMD). We adopt Chamfer Distance as\nour loss function for its O(N log N) complexity. We use\nCto represent the nC local centers and Pto represent nP\npoints of the completed point cloud. Give the ground-truth\ncompleted point cloud G, the loss functions for these two\npredictions can be written as:\nJ0 = 1\nnC\n∑\nc∈C\nmin\ng∈G\n∥c −g∥+ 1\nnG\n∑\ng∈G\nmin\nc∈C\n∥g −c∥,\nJ1 = 1\nnP\n∑\np∈P\nmin\ng∈G\n∥p −g∥+ 1\nnG\n∑\ng∈G\nmin\np∈P\n∥g −p∥.\nNote that we also concatenate the predicted local centers\nand the centers of the input point cloud to form the local\ncenters of the whole object C. We directly use the high-\nresolution point cloud Gto supervise the sparse point cloud\nCto encourage them to have similar distributions. Our ﬁnal\nobjective function is the sum of these two objectives J =\nJ0 + J1.\n4. Experiments\nIn this section, we ﬁrst introduce the new benchmarks\nfor diverse point cloud completion and the evaluation met-\nric. Then, we show the results of both our method and sev-\neral baseline methods on our new benchmarks. Lastly, we\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our model on the widely\nused PCN dataset and KITTI benchmark. We also provide\nablation study and visual analysis of our method.\n4.1. Benchmarks for Diverse Point Completion\nWe choose to generate the samples in our benchmarks\nbased on the synthetic dataset, ShapeNet [47], because it\ncontains the complete object models that cannot be obtained\nfrom real-world datasets like ScanNet [5] and S3DIS [2].\nWhat makes our benchmarks distinct is that our benchmarks\ncontain more object categories, more incomplete patterns\nand more viewpoints. Besides, we pay more attention to\nthe ability of networks to deal with the objects from novel\ncategories that do not appear in the training set.\nShapeNet-55 Benchmark: In this benchmark, we use all\nthe objects in ShapeNet from 55 categories. Most ex-\nisting datasets for point cloud completion like PCN [51]\nonly consider a relatively small number of categories ( e.g.,\n8 categories in PCN). However, the incompleted point\nclouds from the real-world scenarios are much more di-\nverse. Therefore, we propose to evaluate the point cloud\ncompletion models on all 55 categories in ShapeNet to more\ncomprehensively test the ability of models with a more di-\nverse dataset. We split the original ShapeNet using the 80-\n20 strategy: we randomly sample 80% objects from each\ncategory to form the training set and use the rest for eval-\nuation. As a result, we get 41,952 models for training and\n10,518 models for testing. For each object, we randomly\nsample 8,192 points from the surface to obtain the point\ncloud.\nShapeNet-34 Benchmark:In this benchmark, we want to\nexplore another important issue in point cloud completion:\nthe performance on novel categories. We believe it is nec-\nessary to build a benchmark for this task to better evaluate\nthe generalization performance of models. We ﬁrst split the\norigin ShapeNet into two parts: 21 unseen categories and 34\nseen categories. In the seen categories, we randomly sample\n100 objects from each category to construct a test set of the\nseen categories (3,400 objects in total) and leave the rest as\nthe training set, resulting in 46,765 object models for train-\ning. We also construct another test set consisting of 2,305\nobjects from 21 novel categories. We evaluate the perfor-\nmance on both the seen and unseen categories to show the\ngeneralization ability of models.\nTraining and Evaluation:In both benchmarks, the partial\npoint clouds for training are generated online. We sample\n2048 points from the object as the input and 8192 points as\nthe ground truth. In order to mimic the real-world situation,\nwe ﬁrst randomly select a viewpoint and then remove the n\nfurthest points from the viewpoint to obtain a training par-\ntial point cloud. Although the projection method proposed\nin [51] is a better approximation to real scans, our strategy is\nmore ﬂexible and efﬁcient. Our experiments on KITTI also\nshow the model learned on our dataset works well when\nﬁnetuning to real-world scans. Besides, our strategy also\nensures the diversity of our training samples in the aspect\nof viewpoints. During training, n is randomly chosen from\n2048 to 6144 (25% to 75% of the complete point cloud), re-\nsulting in different level of incompleteness. We then down-\nsample the remaining point clouds to 2048 points as the in-\nput data for models.\nDuring evaluation, we ﬁx 8 view points and n is set to\n2048, 4096 or 6144 (25%, 50% or 75% of the whole point\ncloud) for convenience. According to the value of n, we\ndivide the test samples into three difﬁculty degrees, simple,\nmoderate and hard in our experiments.

In addition,\nwe use the average performance under three difﬁculty de-\ngrees to report the overall performance (Avg).\n4.2. Evaluation Metric\nWe follow the existing works [51, 37, 16, 48] to use the\nmean Chamfer Distance as the evaluation metric, which can\nmeasure distance between the prediction point cloud and\nground-truth in set-level. For each prediction, the Chamfer\nDistance between the prediction point setPand the ground-\ntruth point set Gis calculated by:\ndCD(P, G) = 1\n|P|\n∑\np∈P\nmin\ng∈G\n∥p −g∥+ 1\n|G|\n∑\ng∈G\nmin\np∈P\n∥g −p∥\nFollowing the previous methods, we use two versions of\nChamfer distance as the evaluation metric to compare the\nperformance with existing works.

We also follow [36] to adopt F-Score as\nanother evaluation metric.\n4.3. Results on ShapeNet-55\nWe ﬁrst conduct experiments on ShapeNet-55, which\nconsists of objects from 55 categories. To compare with ex-\nisting methods, We implement FoldingNet [50], PCN [51],\nTopNet [37], PFNet [16] and GRNet [48] on our bench-\nmark according to their open-source code and use the best\nhyper-parameters in their papers for fair comparisons. We\nﬁrst investigate how the existing methods and our method\nperform when there are objects from more categories. The\nlast four columns in Table 1 show that our PoinTr can better\ncope with different situations with diverse viewpoints, di-\nverse object categories, diverse incomplete patterns and di-\nverse incompleteness levels. We achieve 0.58, 0.6 and 0.69\nimprovement in CD- ℓ2 (multiplied by 1000) under three\nsettings (simple, moderate and hard) comparing with the\nSOTA method GRNet [48]. PFNet [16], which proposes\nto directly predict the missing parts of objects, fail in our\nbenchmarks due to the high diversity. We further report the\nperformance on categories with sufﬁcient and insufﬁcient\nsamples. We only sample 10 categories out from 55 cate-\ngories to show the results due to the limited space, in which\nTable, chair, Airplane,Car and Sofa contain more than 2500\nsamples in the training set while Birdhouse, Bag, Remote,\nKeyboard and Rocket contain less than 80 samples. We also\nprovide the detailed results for all 55 categories in our sup-\nplementary material. We place the categories with sufﬁ-\ncient samples at the ﬁrst ﬁve columns and the categories\nwith insufﬁcient samples in the following ﬁve columns in\nTable 1. The average CD results for three difﬁculty de-\ngrees are also reported. Surprisingly, there is no obvious\ndifference between the results on these two kinds of cate-\ngories. However, except for our PoinTr and SOTA method\nGRNet, the imbalance in the number of training samples\nlead to a relatively high CD in the categories with insufﬁ-\ncient samples. Besides, our model achieves 0.46 F-Score on\nShapeNet-55, while the state-of-the-art GRNet only obtain\n0.24 F-Score. These results clearly demonstrate the effec-\ntiveness of PoinTr under the more diverse setting.\n4.4. Results on ShapeNet-34\nOn ShapeNet-34, we also conduct experiments for our\nmethod and other ﬁve state-of-the-art methods. The results\nare shown in Table 2. For the 34 seen categories, we can\nsee our method outperforms all the other methods. For the\n21 unseen categories, we using the networks that are trained\non the 34 seen categories to evaluate the performance on the\nnovel objects from the other 21 categories that do not appear\nin the training phase. We see our method also achieves the\nbest performance in this more challenging setting. Compar-\ning with the results of seen categories, we see in the simple\nI n p u t\nG R N e t\nO u r s\nG .

But when the\ndifﬁculty level increases, the performance gap between seen\ncategories and unseen categories signiﬁcantly increases. We\nalso visualize the results in Figure 4 to show the effective-\nness of our method on the unseen categories.\n4.5. Results on the Existing Benchmarks\nApart from the experiments on the two newly proposed\nchallenging benchmarks, we also conduct the experiments\non the existing benchmarks including the PCN dataset [51]\nTable 3: Results on the PCN dataset.

To verify the effectiveness of our\nmethod on existing benchmarks and compare it with more\nstate-of-the-art methods, we conducted experiments on this\ndataset following the standard protocol and evaluation met-\nric used in previous work [51, 17, 48, 45, 43]. The results\nare shown in Table 3. We see our method largely improves\nthe previous methods and establishes the new state-of-the-\nart on this dataset.\nResults on KITTI Benchmark.To show the performance\nof our method in real-world scenarios, we follow [48] to\nﬁnetune our trained model on ShapeNetCars [51] and eval-\nuate the performance of our model on KITTI dataset, which\ncontains the incomplete point clouds of cars in the real-\nworld scenes from LiDAR scans. We report the Fidelity\nand MMD metrics in Table 5 and show some reconstruction\nresults in Figure 5. Our method achieves better qualitative\nand quantitative performance.\n4.6. Model Design Analysis\nTo examine the effectiveness of our designs, we conduct\na detailed ablation study on the key components of PoinTr.\nThe results are summarized in Table 4. The baseline model\nA is the vanilla transformer model for point cloud comple-\ntion, which uses the encoder-decoder architecture with the\nstandard transformer blocks. In this model, we form the\npoint proxies directly from the point cloud using a single-\nlayer DGCNN model. We then add the query generator\nTable 5: Results on LiDAR scans from KITTI dataset under the Fidelity and MMD metrics.\nCD-ℓ2 (×1000) AtlasNet [13] PCN [51] FoldingNet [50] TopNet [37] MSN [17] NSFA [52] PFNet [16] CRN [43] GRNet [48]PoinTr\nFidelity↓ 1.759 2.235 7.467 5.354 0.434 1.281 1.137 1.023 0.816 0.000\nMMD↓ 2.108 1.366 0.537 0.636 2.259 0.891 0.792 0.872 0.568 0.526\n( a )\n ( b )\n ( c )\n ( d )\n ( e )\nI\nn\np\nu\nt\nF\no\nl\nd\ni\nn\ng\nN\ne\nt\nP\nC\nN\nT\no\np\nN\ne\nt\nP\nF\nN\ne\nt\nG\nR\nN\ne\nt\nO\nu\nr\ns\nG\n.\nT\n.\nFigure 6: Qualitative results on ShapeNet-55. All methods\nabove takes the point clouds in the ﬁrst line as inputs and\ngenerate complete point clouds. Our methods can complete\nthe point clouds with higher ﬁdelity, which clearly shows\nthe effectiveness of our method.\nbetween the encoder and decoder (model B). We see the\nquery generator improve the baseline by 0.34 in Chamfer\ndistance. When using DGCNN to extract features from the\ninput point cloud (model C), we observe a signiﬁcant im-\nprovement to 8.69. By adding the geometric block to all the\ntransformer blocks (model D), we see the performance can\nbe further improved, which clearly demonstrates the effec-\ntiveness of the geometric structures learned by the block.\nWe ﬁnd that only adding the geometric block to the ﬁrst\ntransformer block in both encoder and decoder can lead to a\nslightly better performance (model E), which indicates the\nrole of geometric block is to introduce the inductive bias and\na single layer is sufﬁcient while adding more blocks may re-\nsult in over-ﬁtting. Besides, we see our method can achieve\nover 0.74 F-Score on the PCN dataset while obtaining only\n0.46 F-Score on our ShapeNet-55, which also suggests our\nnew datatset is much more challenging.\n4.7. Qualitative Results\nIn Figure 6, we show some completion results for all\nmethods and ﬁnd our method perform better. For example,\nthe input data in (a) nearly lose all the geometric informa-\ntion and can be hardly recognized as an airplane. In this\ncase, other methods can only roughly complete the shape\nwith unsatisfactory geometry details, while our method can\nstill complete the point cloud with higher ﬁdelity. These\nresults show our method has a stronger ability to recover\ndetails and is more robust to various incomplete patterns.\nMore results can be found in the supplementary material.\n5. Conclusion\nIn this paper, we have proposed a new architecture,\nPoinTr, to convert the point cloud completion task into a\nset to set translation tasks. With several technical innova-\ntions, we successfully applied the transformer model to this\ntask and achieved state-of-the-art performance. Moreover,\nwe proposed two more challenging benchmarks for more\ndiverse point cloud completion. Extending our transformer\narchitecture to other 3D tasks can an interesting future di-\nrection.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported in part by the National Key\nResearch and Development Program of China under Grant\n2017YFA0700802, in part by the National Natural Sci-\nence Foundation of China under Grant 61822603, Grant\nU1813218, and Grant U1713214, in part by a grant from\nthe Beijing Academy of Artiﬁcial Intelligence (BAAI), and\nin part by a grant from the Institute for Guo Qiang, Tsinghua\nUniversity.\nA. Implementation Details\nOur proposed method PointTr is implemented with Py-\nTorch [26]. We utilize AdamW optimizer [21] to train the\nnetwork with initial learning rate as 0.0005 and weight de-\ncay as 0.0005. In all of our experiments, we set the depth of\nthe encoder and decoder in our transformer to 6 and 8 and\nset k of kNN operation to 16 and 8 for the DGCNN feature\nextractor and the geometry-aware block respectively. We\nuse 6 head attention for all transformer blocks and set their\nhidden dimensions to 384. On the PCN dataset, the network\ntakes 2048 points as inputs and is required to complete the\nother 14336 points. We set the batch size to 54 and train\nthe model for 300 epochs with the continuous learning rate\ndecay of 0.9 for every 20 epochs. We set N to 128 and M\nto 224. On ShapeNet-55/34, the model takes 2048 points as\ninputs and is required to complete the other 6144 points. We\nset the batch size to 128 and train the model for 200 epochs\nwith the continuous learning rate decay of 0.76 for every 20\nepochs. We set N to 128 and M to 96.\nWe employ a lightweight DGCNN [44] model to extract\nthe point proxy features. To reduce the computational cost,\nwe hierarchically downsample the original input point cloud\nto N = 128 center points and use several DGCNN lay-\ners to capture local geometric relationships. The detailed\nnetwork architecture is: Linear(Cin = 3, Cout = 8) →\nDGCNN(Cin = 8, Cout = 32, K= 8, Nout = 2048) →\nDGCNN(Cin = 32, Cout = 64, K= 8, Nout = 512) →\nDGCNN(Cin = 64, Cout = 64, K= 8, Nout = 512) →\nDGCNN(Cin = 64, Cout = 128, K = 8, Nout = 128),\nwhere Cin and Cout are the numbers of channels of input\nand output features, Nout is the number of points after FPS.\nB. Technical Details on Transformers\nEncoder-Decoder Architecture. The overall architecture\nof the transformer encoder-decoder networks is illustrated\nin Figure 7. The point proxies are passed through the trans-\nformer encoder with N multi-head self-attention layers and\nfeed-forward network layers. Then, the decoder receives\nthe generated query embeddings and encoder memory, and\nproduces the ﬁnal set of predicted point proxies that repre-\nsents the missing part of the point cloud through N multi-\nhead self-attention layers, decoder-encoder attention layers\nand feed-forward network layers. We set N to 6 in all our\nexperiments following common practice [39].\nMulti-head Attention. Multi-head attention mechanism\nallows the network to jointly attend to information from dif-\nferent representation subspaces at different positions [39].\nSpeciacally, given the input values V , keys K and queries\nQ, the multi-head attention is computed by:\nMultiHead(Q, K, V) =WOConcat(head1, ...,headh),\nMulti-HeadSelf-AttentionNormalization\nFeed-Forward NetworkNormalization+\n+\ninputpointproxies\nMulti-HeadSelf-AttentionNormalization+\nqueryembeddings\nMulti-HeadSelf-AttentionNormalization+Feed-Forward NetworkNormalization+\npredictedproxies\n𝑁×\n𝑁×\nEncoder\nDecoder\n𝑉𝐾Q 𝑉𝐾Q\n𝑉𝐾Q\nFigure 7: The overall architecture of the transformer encoder-\ndecoder networks.\nwhere WO the weights of the output linear layer and each\nhead feature can be obtained by:\nheadi = softmax(QWQ\ni (KW K\ni )T\n√dk\n)V WV\ni\nwhere WQ\ni , WK\ni and WV\ni are the linear layers that project\nthe inputs to different subspaces and dk is the dimension of\nthe input features.\nFeed-forward network (FFN). Following [39], we use\ntwo linear layers with ReLU activations and dropout as the\nfeed-forward network.\nC.

Visualization of the Predicted Centers\nWe visualize the local center prediction results on\nShapeNet-55. We adopt a coarse-to-ﬁne strategy to recover\nthe point cloud. Our method starts with the prediction of lo-\ncal centers, then we can obtain the ﬁnal results by adding the\npoints around the centers. As shown in Figure 8, Line (a)\nshows the input partial point cloud and the predicted point\ncenters. Line (b) is the predicted point clouds. We see the\npredicted point proxies can successfully represent the over-\nall structure of the point cloud and the details then are added\nin the ﬁnal predictions.\nF. Qualitative Results\nIn Figure 9, we provide more qualitative results on\nShapeNet-55. We see our results are much better than base-\nline methods visually.\nReferences\n[1] Panos Achlioptas, Olga Diamanti, Ioannis Mitliagkas, and\nLeonidas J. Guibas.
