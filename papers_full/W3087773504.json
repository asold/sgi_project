Since then, the deﬁnition of tool use has evolved to encompass the physical\nproperties of tools, specifying that a tool must alter “the form, position or condition of another\nobject, another organism or the user itself ” (Beck, 1980, p.10), and to include ways of manipulating\nand manufacture of tools (St Amant and Horton, 2008) in order to distinguish between those\nspecies that have the capability to create or use an external object to solve a problem via dynamic\nmechanical interactions, i.e., “ﬂexible tool users, ” and those that are “stereotyped tool users, ” i.e.,\nspecies that perform object-related mechanical actions that are not intended to have a goal-directed\ninteraction with another object (Hunt et al., 2013). This is an important distinction because ﬂexible\ntool use is not phylogenetically widespread and seems to require a certain level of cognitive\nprocessing (Baber, 2003). In this paper, our focus will primarily be on ﬂexible tool use.\nThe deﬁnition of tool use speciﬁes that the tool has to be detached from the substrate and directly\nheld in the animal’s hand or mouth. This deﬁnition has opened a debate in the ﬁeld of tool-use\nsince many animals, including birds, cannot hold tools in their hand or mouth but instead use their\nbeak or foot and others may throw or drop objects to achieve their goals (St Amant and Horton,\n2008). Given these diﬀerences in the way tools are used, a distinction was made between “true tool-\nusers, ” i.e., those that follow the traditional deﬁnition of tool-use albeit broadening the criteria to\ninclude beaks and limbs [e.g., New Caledonian crows ( Corvus moneduloides) using twigs as hooks\nto retrieve food from small holes (Hunt, 1996)], and borderline or “proto-tool” users, i.e., those that\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 1 September 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 560669\nfpsyg-11-560669 September 30, 2020 Time: 16:44 # 2\nCabrera-Álvarez and Clayton Neural Processes Underlying Tool Use\nuse objects to obtain food that would otherwise be out of reach\nbut do not hold these objects in their limbs or mouths/beaks [e.g.,\nAmerican crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos) dropping nuts in roads\nto get them crashed by the passing of automobiles over them\n(Grobecker and Pietsch, 1978)]. From a cognitive perspective,\nit makes sense to make this distinction, since holding the tool\nin a part of the user’s body might make the user include that\nobject as part of their own body, while those animals that just\nthrow or drop objects might not have the ability to include\nthe object in their body-image. As Jacob Bronowski graciously\nexpressed, “the hand is the cutting edge of the mind” (Bronowski,\n1975, p.116), and thus we should not forget their importance\nfor body awareness.\nRecently, Fragaszy and Mangalam (2018) developed a theory\nof tool use which the authors termed “tooling.” This theory\nis framed in biomechanical and spatial concepts of action in\norder to determine when an object is used as a tool. It aims\nto reconceptualize the phenomenon of tool use. The authors\ndeveloped the concept of “tooling, ” which we adopt as a legitimate\ndescription of what we consider tool use: “Tooling is deliberately\nproducing a mechanical eﬀect upon a target object/surface by ﬁrst\ngrasping an object, thus transforming the body into the body-\nplus-object system, and then using the body-plus-object system\nto manage (at least one) spatial relation(s) between a grasped\nobject and a target object/surface, creating a mechanical interface\nbetween the two” (Fragaszy and Mangalam, 2018, p.194).\nBefore Goodall’s observations, it was widely believed that tool\nuse was a uniquely human characteristic (Oakley, 1972), since\nthe use and manufacture of tools has historically been linked\nto the emergence of technical intelligence in humans given the\ncomplex problem solving and planning needed to create and\nuse composite tools (i.e., tools made of two or more joined\nparts) (Ambrose, 2001). Since then, many observations of both\nproto- and true-tool use have been reported, not only in primates\nbut also in other mammals (Mann et al., 2008; Root-Bernstein\net al., 2019), birds (Hunt, 1996), reptiles (Dinets et al., 2015), ﬁsh\n(Brown, 2012), and insects (Pierce, 1986). It is worth mentioning\nthat ﬂexible tool use is mostly found in birds and primates, while\ninsects and ﬁsh mostly show stereotypical tool use (Hunt et al.,\n2013). Most signiﬁcantly, Hunt made the remarkable discovery\nthat New Caledonian crows manufacture and craft a variety of\ntools which they use to obtain food that cannot be reached in any\nother way (Hunt, 1996). Subsequent research by Hunt and other\nmembers of Gray and Taylor’s research groups have revealed\nmany fascinating ﬁndings about the complexity of physical\ncognition in these birds (Hunt and Gray, 2004; Taylor et al., 2009,\n2010). These observations provide evidence that evolutionarily\ndistant species are capable of similar complex motor skills that\nrequire a certain level of cognitive ability to perform them.\nHodos (1987) suggested the study of animal tool use as one\nof the speciﬁc intellectual abilities that can be used as a proxy\nto understanding the concept of animal intelligence proposed by\nMacphail (1987). Hodos (1987) argued that we would understand\nanimal intelligence more rapidly if we focus our eﬀorts in the\nstudy of speciﬁc intellectual abilities rather than in the search of\ngeneral intelligence. However, our understanding of the neural\nprocesses underlying tool use in non-human animals remains\nscant, even though descriptive reports and ecological literature\nrelated to animal tool use has grown dramatically.\nHaving a proper understanding of the neural mechanisms\nunderlying tool use is pivotal to comprehend the evolutionary\nprocesses that enabled evolutionarily distant animals to achieve\nsimilar cognitive capabilities because the comparison of the brain\nstructures that are needed for this speciﬁc intellectual ability will\nshed light on the evolutionary paths that give rise to animal\nintelligence. This review compiles information regarding brain\nareas active during tool use in humans and macaques, and will\nsuggest possible areas in the bird brain that could be a focus of\nstudy in the future.\nTOOL USE IN HUMANS\nThe neural basis of tool use in humans was ﬁrst studied in\npatients with brain lesions that impaired their ability to use tools,\na consequence of a disorder known as apraxia (Johnson-Frey,\n2004; Lewis, 2006; Higuchi et al., 2007; Frey, 2008). Patients with\napraxia do not show diﬃculties in linguistic, sensory or lower\nlevel motor functions. However, they do exhibit an impaired\nability to carry out acquired skills, including, although not\nspeciﬁc to, the use of tools. There are two types of apraxia that\naﬀect tool use: ideomotor apraxia and ideational, or conceptual,\napraxia. In ideomotor apraxia, although patients know what\nto do with a tool and can grasp and manipulate it, they\nseem to be unable to represent the associated motor actions\nneeded to properly use the tools, failing to pantomime how\nthe tools are used. These patients suﬀer from damage to the\nleft posterior parietal and/or premotor cortex, or damage to the\ncorpus callosum that results in isolation of the left hemisphere\nfrom the right (Frey, 2008). On the other hand, in ideational\nor conceptual apraxia, patients know how to handle the tools,\nbut can not follow the order of a sequence of movements to\nachieve a goal that is the product of a multistep action. Ideational\napraxia patients commonly have lesions at the intersection of the\ntemporal-parietal-occipital cortices of the left hemisphere (Frey,\n2008). The studies of apraxia show, not only that the motor\nskills and conceptual knowledge about complex actions such as\ntool use are dissociable, but also that they are represented in\ndissociable neural systems within the left cerebral hemisphere\n(Johnson-Frey, 2004; Lewis, 2006; Frey, 2008).\nSubsequently, fMRI and PET studies in healthy humans\nhighlighted the areas of the cortex that are active during tool\nuse or during mimicking and imaging tool use (reviewed in\nLewis, 2006, see his Figure 5B). Lewis’ ﬁgures (2006) show that\nmost activity during tool use is in the left hemisphere of the\nhuman cortex. This is the case for right-handed people, while the\nright hemisphere might have higher activation during tool use\nin left-handed people (reviewed in Lewis, 2006). Further studies\ncomparing right- vs. left-handed people are needed in order to\ndisentangle the lateralization of tool use in humans.\nPeeters et al. (2009, 2013) identiﬁed the anterior\nsupramarginal gyrus (aSMG), a speciﬁc region of the human\nbrain left inferior parietal lobule (IPL), as being involved in\nboth the execution and observation of tool actions. They did not\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 2 September 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 560669\nfpsyg-11-560669 September 30, 2020 Time: 16:44 # 3\nCabrera-Álvarez and Clayton Neural Processes Underlying Tool Use\nﬁnd a similar activation in the IPL of rhesus monkeys that were\ntrained to use tools. In a subsequent study, Gallivan et al. (2013)\nfound speciﬁc brain areas involved only in tool-related actions,\nin contrast with brain regions involved only in hand-related\nactions, and suggested a brain network for human tool use\n(Figure 1 ). This brain network was later expanded to include\nthe connection between the aSMG, which is active during the\nobservation of the tool being moved to achieve a goal, and the\nputative human homolog of anterior intraparietal (phAIP) in\nmacaques, a region active during observation of tool grasping\n(Figure 2 ; Orban and Caruana, 2014). Figure 2 showcases the\ncognitive processes involved in tool use, which are reasoning\naﬀordances (i.e., forming conclusions about the qualities of\nan object that deﬁnes its possible uses), mechanical problem\nsolving (i.e., ﬁnding solutions to novel mechanical problems),\nand semantic knowledge (i.e., a type of long term memory\nconsisting of concepts, facts, ideas, and beliefs). This suggested\nbrain network also highlights the brain areas underpinning\nthese cognitive processes, which would all provide input to the\naSMG. For further reading, additional reviews on human tool\nuse have been recently published (Osiurak and Badets, 2016;\nReynaud et al., 2016).\nAlthough the cerebellum is not mentioned in these brain\nnetworks, its function in tool-use has been under debate despite\nFIGURE 1 |Cortical areas that coded only hand actions (red), only tool actions (blue), both hand and tool actions but using different neural representations (pink),\nand areas coding an action independently of it being performed with the hand or a tool (purple).

For example, it is unclear why cerebellar lesions do not\ncause ideomotor apraxia if the cerebellum stores representations\nof tool-use skills (Johnson-Frey, 2004). Yet, its development\nduring human evolution and its interactions with the neocortex\nhave been related to greater computational eﬃciency for dealing\nwith increasingly complex cultural and conceptual environments\n(Weaver, 2005). In great apes, cerebellar volume and lateral\nasymmetry of the cerebellum is related to species-speciﬁc\ndiﬀerences in performance and hand preference for task that\nrequire precise motor skills, such as tool use and aimed throwing\n(Cantalupo and Hopkins, 2010). Additionally, the cerebellum\nplays an important role in the evolution of the capacity for\nplanning, execution and understanding of complex behavioral\nsequences—including tool use and language (Barton, 2012;\nBarton and Venditti, 2014), and the neural mechanisms of tool\nuse may be precursors for the neural basis of language and\nabstract thought (Hihara et al., 2003; Iriki and Taoka, 2012; Steele\net al., 2012). These authors have suggested that the use of tools as\nequivalents of body parts would have triggered the development\nof more advanced problem solving skills: abstract thinking\n(i.e., the ability to think about things that are not physically\npresent) was essential for the development of conceptual thinking\n(i.e., the ability of integrating a series of features that group\ntogether to form a class of ideas or objects) and hence, the\ndevelopment of language.\nDespite the relevance of tool use to human evolution and\nthe beneﬁts that its study would bring to our understanding\nof brain evolution, the neural processes underlying tool use in\nother animals have not yet been closely studied, partly due to the\nmethodological diﬃculty in reproducing the same sort of studies\nin animals. Given the hypothesis that tool use in humans would\nhave led to the evolution of more complex cognitive abilities,\ncomparisons of both the cognitive and neural mechanisms of\ntool use in humans and other vertebrates would increase our\nunderstanding of the evolution of physical cognition. An obvious\nstarting point for such a comparison is to focus on non-human\nprimates as there are many examples of tool-use in the wild, such\nas axing oysters (Gumert et al., 2009), nut-cracking, ant-dipping,\nand termite ﬁshing, which have been previously reviewed (e.g.,\nvan Schaik et al., 1999; Whiten et al., 1999; Emery and Clayton,\n2009), and in captivity, even in species that have not been\nobserved using tools in their natural environment (van Lawick-\nGoodall, 1970; van Schaik et al., 1999). It is interesting to note\nthat despite assumptions that non-human primates show ﬂexible\ntool use, high cognitive abilities may not be necessary for the\nperformance of tool use in many of the examples given (Penn\nand Povinelli, 2007). Instead, simpler forms of learning, such as\naﬀordance learning (i.e., learning about the use or purpose that\nan object can have, either directly or through social learning)\nmay be responsible in some species for instrumental object\nmanipulation (Whiten et al., 1999; Martin-Ordas et al., 2008;\nGruber et al., 2011).\nKeeping in consideration that the development of human\nhigh order cognition, including abstract thinking, might have\nbeen enhanced once humans used tools as equivalents of\nbody parts (Iriki and Taoka, 2012), it is reasonable to assume\nthat the comparison between humans and other vertebrates’\ncognitive and neural mechanisms of tool use would increase our\nunderstanding of the evolution of physical cognition. Despite\nthe abundant number of tool-use observations and cognitive\nstudies, the study of the neural mechanisms governing tool-use\nin non-human primates is challenging. PET scanning studies, for\nexample, require primates to remain completely immobile, except\nfor the limb that uses the tool, during data collection to prevent\nconfounding motion artifacts. Accurate measurements can only\nbe achieved by conﬁning the limbs not involved in the studied\nactions to small spaces and by limiting movement of the subject’s\nhead using a custom-made chair. These constraints explain why\nthere is so little non-human research on the matter, and also why\nmost studies have very small sample sizes.\nTOOL USE IN MACAQUES\nMacaques are of particular importance because they have\nspecial neurons that become active both when they see another\nindividual performing an action and when they do the action\nthemselves (Rizzolatti and Craighero, 2004). These neurons,\nlocated in premotor cortex F5, are of two types: canonical\nneurons and mirror neurons. Canonical neurons respond to\nthe presentation of a graspable object or are active when the\nmacaques grasp that object, while mirror neurons respond\nwhen the macaque sees object-directed actions (Rizzolatti and\nCraighero, 2004; Iriki, 2006; although see Hickok, 2010 for a\ncritical review on mirror neuron function). Similar neurons were\nsubsequently found in both humans and birds (Rizzolatti and\nCraighero, 2004; Welberg, 2008), although it remains unclear\nwhether they exists in birds outside of the context of song\nlearning. The ability to use tools and the presence of mirror\nneurons in their brains make macaques an interesting model\nfor the study of tool use in vertebrates since mirror neurons\nare active during object-directed actions. Although there are\nneurocognitive studies exploring tool-use in a number of other\nspecies of non-human primates (e.g., Hopkins et al., 2012, 2017;\nPhillips and Thompson, 2013; Mayer et al., 2019) we have focused\nthe following section on macaques because our objective is to\nsuggest a possible neural network for tool use in a non-human\nprimate species. For this purpose, using a single genus instead of\na combination of ﬁndings from multiple species prevents us from\ngenerating a misleading network, since diﬀerent species might\ndiﬀer in many ways, including anatomically, mechanistically,\nbehaviorally, and cognitively.\nMacaque Active Brain Areas During Tool\nUse\nObayashi et al. (2001, 2002, 2004, 2007) performed a series\nof studies on two awaken-behaving male Japanese monkeys\n(Macaca fuscata ). They explored the brain areas that are\nactive during tool use by using PET scans during a task in\nwhich the subjects were previously trained to use tools to\ncollect an unreachable food pellet. They used a control task in\nwhich the subjects experienced almost the same sensorimotor\ncircumstances as in the experimental task, but without any\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 4 September 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 560669\nfpsyg-11-560669 September 30, 2020 Time: 16:44 # 5\nCabrera-Álvarez and Clayton Neural Processes Underlying Tool Use\nlearning involved (i.e., manipulation of the control apparatus\ndid not result in the macaques learning how to reach the\nreward, but once the macaques had manipulated the control\napparatus the experimenters moved the reward within their\nreach). In their 2001 study, the subjects had to reach the pellet\nwith one rack. In their 2002 study, they had to poke a pellet\nwith a rack out of a transparent tube and reach it with a\nsecond rack. In their 2004 and 2007 studies, the subjects had\nto obtain an unreachable pellet by manipulating a joystick or\na pair of dials, respectively, which controlled the position of\na shovel that moved in a two-dimensional space. They found\nthe following active brain areas during tool use in macaques\n(Obayashi et al., 2001, 2002, 2004, 2007).\nPrefrontal Cortex (PFC)\nSpeciﬁcally, area 9/46 seems to be involved in executive functions,\nsince it is active during a sequence of tool combination tasks\nbut not during single tasks (Obayashi et al., 2002). It is also\nactive during abstract actions like remote operations using dials\nin a set of sequences (Obayashi et al., 2007). Together with the\ncerebellum, this area is involved in the automatization of learned\nmotor sequences (Obayashi et al., 2004).\nIntraparietal Sulcus (IPS)\nThis region is the area of the brain that creates, stores, and\nupdates the body-image, i.e., the primate’s awareness of where\nits limbs are in space, and what actions they are performing\n(Obayashi et al., 2001, 2002, 2004, 2007). It has an important role\nin tool use because it provides the individual with an updated\nspatial representation of the situation, which is vital for the\nsuccessful completion of the goal.\nInferior Temporal Cortex\nIncluding the posterior portion of inferior temporal cortices (area\nTEO). This region is involved in object recognition and memory.\nIts extensive connections with IPS suggests that it might help\nthis other area in maintaining and manipulating the body-image\n(Obayashi et al., 2002).\nPremotor Cortex\nThere are two areas of interest within this region: F5 and dorsal\npremotor cortex (PMD). F5, the area containing mirror neurons\nin macaques, is involved in the execution of goal-directed manual\nactions (Rizzolatti and Craighero, 2004). The PMD is involved\nin planning coordinated activation of muscles and joints to\naccurately perform desired movements (Obayashi et al., 2001,\n2004). Thus, the combined activation of these two areas might\nbe involved in the accurate execution of goal-directed actions\nperformed with tools.\nPre-supplementary Motor Area (pre-SMA)\nThis area, which receives input from the premotor cortex\n(especially from F5), was suggested to be involved in the\nmaintenance and updating of the body-image, which would be\nhelpful for the execution of tool-based/use actions and sequential\nmovements (Obayashi et al., 2001, 2004).\nBasal Ganglia\nIt was suggested that the basal ganglia, as well as the IPS\nbimodal neurons, is involved in the creation and maintenance\nof the spatiotemporal representation of the hand during tool use\n(Obayashi et al., 2001).\nCerebellum\nThe cerebellum was suggested to be involved in the learning\nprocesses required for tool use and “reconstruction of the\nacquired body-image, ” and “may modulate higher cognitive\nfunctions of the executive process as a cerebro-cerebellar loop\nfrom an anatomical perspective” (Obayashi et al., 2007).\nThese brain areas are important for tool use but that is not\ntheir only role. They can also be involved in less functional or\nless goal-directed forms of object manipulation, such as object\nexploration or object play, often claimed to be associated in the\ndevelopment, evolution and daily expression of tool use (Smith,\n1982; Kerney et al., 2017).\nBased on the information collected in the aforementioned\nstudies and the available data on macaque brain connections\n(Schaal, 1999; Hihara et al., 2006; Van Essen and Dierker, 2007;\nBorra et al., 2008; Smaers et al., 2013; Takada et al., 2013;\nRizzolatti et al., 2014), we suggest the following brain network for\ntool use in macaques, represented in Figure 3. The visual input\nabout the tool and the task or problem that needs to be solved\nusing that tool is processed in the visual cortex, which sends\nthis information to the inferior temporal cortex and the IPS. The\ninferior temporal cortex would process the information related\nto object recognition, and would then send this information to\nthe IPS. All of this information would be processed in the IPS\nand a spatial representation of the situation would be created.\nThis information would be sent to area F5 and PMD. These\ntwo areas would coordinate the muscles to accurately perform\nthe goal-directed action, and would send this information to\nthe Pre-SMA, which is involved in the execution of sequential\nmovements. The Pre-SMA would update the basal ganglia about\nthe motor action and the basal ganglia would update the Pre-\nSMA and the PMD about the hand movements during tool\nuse. The information would be sent to a PFC-basal ganglia-\ncerebellum network, involved in novel motor sequences learning\nand automatization of learned motor sequences. Finally, the\ncerebellum would ensure a coordinated motor action. It will be\ninteresting to know whether the same brain regions are involved\nin these aspects of tool use in other animals or whether they are\nspeciﬁc to the macaque brain. Additionally, it will be interesting\nto study the correlation between the speciﬁc patterns of brain\nactivity and the motor movements involved, including in the\ncorrelation the levels of cognitive and behavioral control, such\nas distinctions between ﬂexible and stereotypic tool use, and\ntrue versus proto tool use. An exciting ﬁrst step would be to\nevaluate these issues in corvids, since like macaques and some\nother primates, these birds have relatively large brains for their\nbody size, are highly social, have relatively long life spans and\nare known to use tools for extractive foraging and other problem\nsolving tasks (Emery and Clayton, 2004a) including species that\nonly do so in captivity (Clayton and Emery, 2015). Indeed\nClayton and her colleagues have argued for the convergence\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 5 September 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 560669\nfpsyg-11-560669 September 30, 2020 Time: 16:44 # 6\nCabrera-Álvarez and Clayton Neural Processes Underlying Tool Use\nFIGURE 3 |Suggested macaque brain network for tool use.

By studying the neural processes\nof tool use in birds we could identify the brain areas involved\nin meticulous motor skills and complex cognitive abilities such\nas problem solving and future planning, which would help us\nunderstanding the complexity of the avian brain and its analogies\nwith the mammalian brain (Grodzinski and Clayton, 2010). This\nis crucial to increasing our understanding of the convergent\nevolution of physical cognition among vertebrates.\nAmong birds, corvids are the family with the highest known\nnumber of true tool-user species (Lefebvre et al., 2002). For\ninstance, New Caledonian crows manufacture hook tools out of\nplants to collect food in the wild (Hunt, 1996), with diﬀerent\npopulations within New Caledonia showing diﬀerent strategies\nto manufacture these tools, which is hypothesized to have evolved\nthrough a process of cumulative change (Hunt and Gray, 2003).\nNew Caledonian crows also select tools of the right length\nto achieve their goal (Chappell and Kacelnik, 2002), shape\nunfamiliar materials to create usable tools for speciﬁc tasks (Weir\net al., 2002), manufacture tools of the best diameter to achieve\na reward (Chappell and Kacelnik, 2004), can infer weights from\nhow objects move under a current of wind (Jelbert et al., 2019),\nand are capable of spontaneous meta-tool use (using a tool to\nobtain a tool in order to achieve a goal) (Taylor et al., 2007).\nRecently, it was found that Hawaiian crows (Corvus hawaiiensis),\nwhich were considered extinct in the early 2000s and currently\nlive in captivity, are capable of tool use and tool manufacture\n(Rutz et al., 2016).\nOther species of corvids that are not known to be tool-users\nin the wild are capable of readily using and making tools in\ncaptivity. For example, rooks ( Corvus frugilegus ) were able to\nspontaneously create hook tools from pieces of straight wire and\nuse them to collect food that would otherwise have been out of\nbeak reach (Bird and Emery, 2009a). Furthermore they could\nuse stones to raise the water level to reach a ﬂoating reward\n(Bird and Emery, 2009b), a task also performed by other non-\ntool-using corvids such as Eurasian jays ( Garrulus glandarius )\n(Cheke et al., 2011). Northern blue jays (Cyanocitta cristata) also\nmade and used tools to obtain food out of reach (Jones and\nKamil, 1973). Furthermore, ravens (Corvus corax) demonstrated\nproblem-solving skills by string-pulling to collect food (Heinrich\nand Bugnyar, 2005), and are capable of planning for events\nusing tools with delays of up to 17 h, including bartering tokens\nfor food rewards (Kabadayi and Osvath, 2017). Many of these\nbehaviors are under cognitive control, as tasks such as wire\nbending, meta-tool use, inferring the weight of objects, using\nobjects to raise volumes of water, and bartering for tools, require\nsome level of mental processing in order to conceive the problem,\nto understand the characteristics of the available objects, to plan\na solution, and to successfully perform the task to solve the\nproblem. Unfortunately, the neural mechanisms underlying these\nmental processes are still unknown.\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 6 September 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 560669\nfpsyg-11-560669 September 30, 2020 Time: 16:44 # 7\nCabrera-Álvarez and Clayton Neural Processes Underlying Tool Use\nIt is for all these reasons that corvids make an excellent model\nfor the study of the neural mechanisms of tool use (Clayton and\nEmery, 2015; Güntürkün, 2020). Furthermore, they belong to the\norder Passeriformes, in which the neural mechanisms of song\nlearning in songbirds has been extensively studied, and so there\nis a wider amount of available information on neuroanatomy\nand neural networks for corvids compared to other families of\ntool-user birds (Jarvis et al., 2005). For example, some species\nof the order Psittaciformes (which includes parrots, lorikeets,\nand cockatoos) are capable of using and manufacturing tools\n(Auersperg et al., 2012, 2014; Lambert et al., 2015), and, like\ncorvids, they are also social, big-brained, and vocal learners.\nHowever, psittaciformes are evolutionarily less closely related\nto songbirds, and so the study of their neural circuits has\nreceived less attention.\nLefebvre et al. (2002) found that the brain size of true tool-\nusers was signiﬁcantly larger than that of borderline tool-user\nspecies. However, the relatively larger brain of crows and ravens\nis not correlated to tool use, innovative feeding strategies, and\ndispersal success (Jønsson et al., 2012). Lefebvre et al. (2002) also\nfound that, after examining the size of four diﬀerent areas of\nthe telencephalon, the neostriatum [later renamed as nidopallium\n(Jarvis et al., 2005)] was the only area signiﬁcantly larger in true\ntool-using birds compared to borderline tool-users. However, this\nsize diﬀerence does not mean that the nidopallium is the only area\ninvolved in tool use; rather, it means that the cognitive ability to\nuse tools might depend on the relative size of the nidopallium.\nSubsequent studies showed that the neuronal density of the\nbrain of several bird species signiﬁcantly exceeds the neural\ndensities of many mammals, including primates, of similar brain\nmass (Olkowicz et al., 2016). This ﬁnding could explain why\nbirds, which have relatively small brains compared to mammals,\nare capable of performing high cognitive tasks. When comparing\nstudies of apes, corvids and pigeons, Güntürkün et al. (2017, p.39)\nsuggest that a “neuronal surplus may translate into faster and\nmore ﬂexible learning, making the acquisition of certain abstract\nabilities a much easier task”. However, a fundamental diﬀerence\nbetween avian and mammalian brains is that birds lack pyramidal\nneurons. The inability to create long extensions (i.e., association\nﬁbers) that arise from pyramidal neurons means that to exhibit\nsimilar behavior to mammals, birds would need more neurons to\nmake the same computations. Additionally, the small size of avian\nneurons also allows them to have higher neuronal density. An\nadditional hypothesis that we suggest is that the nuclei-organized\nbird forebrain, unlike the cerebral cortex of primates which is\norganized in layers, might be computationally more powerful to\nencode tool-use skills than the isolated neurons in monkeys. To\nexplain the diﬀerences in tool use between humans and monkeys,\nOrban and Caruana (2014) suggested that humans are capable of\nusing tools because we have grouped neurons that respond to tool\naction observation, unlike some species of monkeys which were\nunable to learn to use tools. This same hypothesis can therefore be\napplied to birds, as we have done here. However, further studies\nare needed to ﬁgure out whether tool-use birds own speciﬁc\nneurons that respond to tool action observation.\nIn mammals, the prefrontal cortex plays a crucial role in\nproblem solving (Mushiake et al., 2009). Given the many\nexamples of problem-solving skills of corvids (e.g., Hunt, 1996;\nChappell and Kacelnik, 2002, 2004; Weir et al., 2002; Clayton,\n2007; Taylor et al., 2007; Bird and Emery, 2009a,b; Tebbich\net al., 2012), it is reasonable to assume that there must be\na bird brain area capable of processing information to solve\nproblems in a similar fashion as the mammalian prefrontal\ncortex does (Güntürkün, 2005; Güntürkün and Bugnyar, 2016).\nIdentifying this possible area is crucial to understand how\nthe cognitive abilities of corvids and apes have evolved via\nconvergent evolution. A speciﬁc part of the nidopallium, called\nthe caudolateral nidopallium (NCL) has been suggested as an\nanalogous to the mammalian prefrontal cortex due to its high\ndensity of dopaminergic axons (Divac and Mogensen, 1985;\nWaldmann and Güntürkün, 1993; Güntürkün, 2005) and their\nfunction in reward processing (Koenen et al., 2013), prospective\nprocessing (reviewed in Colombo et al., 2017), reversal learning,\nresponse inhibition and working memory, obtained from studies\nin pigeons (reviewed in Striedter, 2013). The involvement of NCL\nin tool use is uncertain, as neurological studies in tool-using birds\nare rare. However, given the abundant connections of the NCL\nwith other brain areas involved in tool use, it is thought that the\nNCL is “a critical integrative area for telencephalic sensorimotor\npathways” (Striedter, 2013, p.63). Figure 1 in Striedter (2013)\nhighlights the major avian brain areas and circuit diagrams that\nemphasize the role of NCL in tool use. Neurocognitive studies\nin crows have shown the involvement of the NCL in cognitive\ntasks that are important for tool use, such as visual working\nmemory (Veit et al., 2014), associative learning (Veit et al., 2015),\nabstraction of general principles (Veit and Nieder, 2013), or\nrelative numerosity discrimination (Ditz and Nieder, 2015, 2016).\nThe NCL also shows properties such as ﬂexible neuronal tuning\ndepending on behaviorally relevant tasks (Veit et al., 2017) which\nis crucial to encode task relevant information.\nNew Caledonian crows, which are known for their exceptional\nability to build and use tools, have an enlarged mesopallium,\npallidostriatal complex, septum and tegmentum, compared to\nthree other passeriformes (carrion crows, jays and sparrows)\n(Mehlhorn et al., 2010). Mehlhorn et al. (2010) suggest that\nthe mesopallium might be required for enhancement of basic\ntool skills, while the nidopallium, which was also enlarged in\nthis species although not signiﬁcantly, might have a role in\ncognitive and motor skills required for basic tool use. They\nalso suggest that the pallidostriatal complex might be important\nin these birds to learn to manufacture and use tools in novel\nand familiar situations, and the tegmentum would be involved\nin the ﬁne motor skills needed for tool manufacture and use,\nwhile the septum would integrate several stimuli in order\nto modulate complex behaviors, which might not be directly\ninvolved with tool use. In summary, the study by Mehlhorn\net al. (2010) corroborates the ﬁndings of previous studies, such\nas Timmermans et al. (2000), in that the size of the mesopallium\nis correlated to the feeding innovation rate in birds. However, it\nis diﬃcult to determine what roles the septum and tegmentum\ncould play in tool use without further investigations, particularly\nfor the tegmentum, which is a large, multifunctional region.\nAnother region that seems to be important for tool use\nis the cerebellum. The cerebellum seems to be active during\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 7 September 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 560669\nfpsyg-11-560669 September 30, 2020 Time: 16:44 # 8\nCabrera-Álvarez and Clayton Neural Processes Underlying Tool Use\ntool use in macaques and humans, as described previously.\nIn birds, it was found that, although the total size of the\ncerebellum was not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent between tool-user and\nnon-tool-user species, the number of folds in the cerebellar\ncortex was signiﬁcantly larger in the former (Iwaniuk et al.,\n2009). It is possible that the increase in the number of folds\nmight have been a way to supply the increased motor, sensory,\nand cognitive processing demands of the cerebellum of tool-\nuser birds. Furthermore, a recent study in parrots describes a\ntelencephalic-midbrain-cerebellar circuit that resembles the one\nin primates (Gutiérrez-Ibáñez et al., 2018), which is associated\nwith the evolution of complex cognitive abilities, as described\nin previous sections. Particularly, the medial spiriform nucleus\n(SpM), which connects the pallial regions of the telencephalon\nwith the cerebellum in birds, is greatly enlarged in parrots\ncompared with other birds, suggesting that a stronger link\nbetween the pallium and cerebellum is associated with cognition\n(Gutiérrez-Ibáñez et al., 2018). Further studies in birds are\nneeded to clarify the speciﬁc role of the cerebellum and the SpM\nduring tool use.\nThe current literature diﬀers in whether tool-using birds learn\nto use tools from conspeciﬁcs or not. A study on woodpecker\nﬁnches ( Cactospiza pallida ) found that these birds probably\nlearn to use tools by trial and error during their development\n(Tebbich et al., 2001). However, a study of Goﬃn cockatoos\n(Cacatua goﬃniana ) found social transmission of tool use and\ntool manufacture in the males of this species (Auersperg et al.,\n2014), and a study of New Caledonian crows found evidence\nfor probable transmission of tool design between crows (Hunt\nand Gray, 2003). Thus, although true imitation of tool use\nhas not been observed in birds and, hence, it is not possible\nto claim that tool-user birds must have mirror neurons, it is\nimportant to keep in mind that some of the tool-user species have\ndeveloped the cognitive abilities to learn speciﬁc motor actions\nby observing others. This feature may imply the development of\nspeciﬁc neural characteristics in tool-user birds, which might not\nbe present in species that do not use tools and do not learn from\nothers. In order to answer whether birds have developed neural\nmechanisms that are similar to humans and non-human primates\nwhen learning to use tools, it would be of great interest to study\nthe activity in neurons of the above mentioned brain areas during\nobservations of tool use. However, the size of these brain areas\nis so large that more research needs to be done before speciﬁc\nnuclei within these areas can be selected for study. The study of\nthe neural processes of tool use in birds is therefore of pivotal\ninterest in order to answer this and other questions, such as what\nmechanisms are behind the neural development that allows the\ngeneration of the same kind of complex behavioral patterns in\nunrelated species, so we can establish a framework to elucidate\nthe neural mechanisms that supported the convergent evolution\nof tool use in birds and mammals.\nCONCLUSION\nThe study of the neural processes underlying tool use in humans\nand non-human primates has received increased attention over\nthe last decade. Early studies in patients suﬀering from apraxia\nshowed that complex actions that require motor skills and\nconceptual knowledge, such as tool use, are represented in\ndissociable neural systems within the left cerebral hemisphere.\nTwo interconnected regions are particularly important, the\nanterior supramarginal gyrus and the putative human homolog\nof the anterior intraparietal cortex. However, it is clear that\nthese two regions do not work alone, and a complex neural\nnetwork is required to use tools. Similarly, in macaques there\nare also two areas of particular interest: area F5 and the dorsal\npremotor cortex, both located within the premotor cortex.\nHowever, although these two regions seem to be of utmost\nimportance during tool use in macaques, it is evident that,\nas in humans, tool use requires the activation of a complex\nnetwork of brain activation, as we have suggested here. We\nhope that a similar brain network can be elucidated for tool-\nusing corvids in the future, given the abundant evidence of\ntool use and manufacture in this family of birds. We know\nthat New Caledonian crows and Hawaiian crows can use\nand manufacture tools, and New Caledonian crows can infer\ntheir physical properties (Hunt, 1996; Chappell and Kacelnik,\n2002, 2004; Weir et al., 2002; Taylor et al., 2007; Rutz et al.,\n2016; Jelbert et al., 2019). Furthermore, corvid species that\nare not tool-users in the wild, such as rooks, Eurasian jays,\nand northern blue jays, can use and manufacture tools in\ncaptivity and use these skills to solve problems (Jones and\nKamil, 1973; Seed et al., 2006; Tebbich et al., 2007; Bird and\nEmery, 2009a,b; Cheke et al., 2011). Additionally, ravens can\nuse tools to obtain unreachable food and use tokens to barter\n(Heinrich and Bugnyar, 2005; Kabadayi and Osvath, 2017).\nDespite this plethora of examples, we have yet to discover\nthe neural mechanisms underpinning these behaviors and their\ncognitive control in corvids. However, we do know about the\nneural mechanisms of song production and song learning in\nsongbirds, which are birds of the same order as corvids. The\nknowledge on songbird neuroanatomy may serve as a basis to\nexplore the neural mechanisms of tool use in corvids and to\nelucidate a neural network underpinning tool-using behavior.\nWe have reviewed the current evidence of several bird brain\nregions that could be involved in tool use in corvids and that\nshould be the focus of study in future research, such as the\nNCL, mesopallium, pallidostriatal complex, SpM, cerebellum,\nand areas of the tegmentum. Understanding the neural processes\nof tool use in animals other than primates would not only\nincrease our understanding of the evolution of physical cognition\nin vertebrates, including a better understanding of animal\nintelligence, but also beneﬁt our society by providing new models\nwith which scientists can work to understand the origins of\ncomplex motor skills, and ultimately improve the lives of those\naﬀected by motor disabilities.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nMC-Á wrote the manuscript, with critical reviews and important\ndiscussions and additions by NC.
