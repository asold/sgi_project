Critical for all SIT programs is a conditional sexing \nstrain to enable the cost‑effective production of male‑only populations. Compared to current \nfemale‑elimination strategies based on killing or sex sorting, generating male‑only offspring via sex \nconversion would be economically beneficial by doubling the male output. Temperature‑sensitive \nmutations known from the D. melanogaster transformer‑2 gene (tra2\nts) induce sex conversion \nat restrictive temperatures, while regular breeding of mutant strains is possible at permissive \ntemperatures. Since tra2 is a conserved sex determination gene in many Diptera, including the major \nagricultural pest Ceratitis capitata, it is a promising candidate for the creation of a conditional sex \nconversion strategy in this Tephritid. Here, CRISPR/Cas9 homology‑directed repair was used to induce \nthe D. melanogaster-specific tra2\nts SNPs in Cctra2. 100% female to male conversion was successfully \nachieved in flies homozygous for the tra2ts2 mutation. However, it was not possible, to identify \na permissive temperature for the mutation allowing the rearing of a tra2ts2 homozygous line, as \nlowering the temperature below 18.5 °C interferes with regular breeding of the flies.\nThe production of large populations of only male pest insects is a key factor for the Sterile Insect Technique \n(SIT), a highly successful, environment-friendly, and species-specific method of pest control. Proposed in 1955 \nby  Knipling\n1, the SIT is based on the sustained mass-release of sterile males into the existing pest population \nto reduce population size by infertile mating, and has been successfully applied to several pest  species2–5. The \nrelease of pure male populations is important because male-only releases are more effective than bisexual  ones6 \nby preventing the mating of sterile males with the co-released sterile females. In addition, the release of sterile \nfemales could still result in crop damage due to oviposition or, in case of vector insects, in disease transmission. \nSexing, classified as the removal of females from a mass-reared insect population, can be achieved by physical \nsorting, female-specific lethality, or by converting females into  males\n7. Such solutions have been developed for \nmultiple pest species using naturally occurring or classically induced  mutations8–11 or  transgenesis12–17. Most of \nthem, however, are not ready for mass-rearing yet. To allow efficient rearing of sexing strains and cost-effective \noperation of the program, important characteristics of sexing systems are the conditionality and early devel-\nopmental time-point of the sexing, respectively. Currently, two conditional embryonically active systems exist \nfor the devastating agricultural pest Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann; Diptera: Tephritidae) (Mediterranean fruit \nfly, medfly). Medflies pose a vast economic threat to agriculture worldwide, as they feed on > 260 plants (fruits, \nvegetables, nuts) and are highly invasive: Native to the Afrotropical region, medfly can now be found in most \ntropical and temperate  regions\n18,19.\nIn the successful medfly genetic sexing strains (GSS), VIENNA 7 and 8, an unknown recessive autosomal \ntemperature-sensitive lethal ( tsl) mutation eliminates all female embryos upon heat  shock11. The GSS males, \nhowever, are semi-sterile due to chromosomal rearrangements necessary to rescue the WT phenotype, result -\ning in 50% genetically imbalanced gametes and thus non-viable zygotes. In a conditional transgenic embryonic \nsexing system (TESS) medfly female embryos are killed by overexpression of a pro-apoptotic  gene20.

Both factors would considerably reduce costs and increase \nthe efficiency of a medfly SIT program. However, population maintenance would presumably need to be done at \nreduced temperatures, which could decrease the productivity of the mass-rearing due to prolonged development \n times\n21. Currently, the production of one million sterile medfly pupae of the classical GSS is estimated at US$ \n250–500, depending on the production level and the location of the rearing  facility22.\nIn search of genetic elements suitable to construct sexing or sex-conversion systems, insect sex determina -\ntion pathways have been studied to identify essential genes and to understand their function. The transformer-2 \ngene (tra2) is involved in the sex determination pathway of different insects, including C. capitata23,24. In med-\nfly, transformer-2 is an auxiliary factor, necessary to establish and sustain the autoregulation of transformer , a \ngene known to be crucial for the sexual  fate23,25,26. As illustrated and described in detail  elsewhere23,26, maternal \nCctra and Cctra2  initiate a positive feedback loop in XX fertilized eggs and control the female-specific splic-\ning of the downstream targets doublesex  and fruitless 23,26. Switching off either Cctra  or Cctra2  leads to male \n development26 and the transient knock-down of Cctra2  during embryogenesis via RNA interference (RNAi) \nresulted in full sex-reversal of XX-karyotype flies into phenotypic  males23. In contrast to Anastrepha suspensa, \nwhere embryonic injection of dsRNA against Astra2  resulted in sex-reversed XX males, which were infertile \ndespite testes full of sperm  bundles27, medfly XX-karyotype males were  fertile23,25, indicating that male-fertility \nis not Y-dependent in C. capitata . Sex-reversion via RNAi-mediated knock-down of tra2  was also shown in \nBactrocera tau (Walker)28 and B. dorsalis (Hendel)29. However, to make use of the tra2-mediated sex-conversion \nfor male-only production, it needs to be conditionally inducible and stable. In Drosophila melanogaster, two \ntra2 temperature-sensitive mutations ( tra2\nts1, tra2ts2) are known, supposedly causing conformational changes \nin the protein structure at elevated (restrictive) temperatures (29 °C). These result in a loss of protein function \nand therefore in sex-conversion of XX embryos (male-only offspring). At permissive temperatures (e.g. 16 °C), \na functional TRA2 protein allows healthy female development and rearing of the  population\n30,31. Due to the high \nconservation of TRA2 among different  species23,32–36, gene editing techniques such as CRISPR/Cas37 can be used \nto exactly recreate temperature-sensitive tra2 mutations known from D. melanogaster in homologous genes of \npest insects. This has been shown by Li and  Handler38, who introduced the D. melanogaster tra2 ts2 mutation \ntogether with a fluorescent marker into the D. suzukii tra2 gene. 16 °C and 20 °C were permissive temperatures \nfor D. suzukii tra2 ts2  mutants38, resulting in fertile and normally developed males and females. At 26 °C, all \nXX embryos developed as sterile intersex with sex combs and male-like genitalia, and all XY embryos showed \ndysmorphic testes and were sterile. However, the survival rate for both, wild-type and mutant flies was very low \n(5–10%) at this temperature and even lower at more elevated temperatures. While this temperature-sensitivity \nof D. suzukii would be problematic if the tra2\nts2 mutation were to be used for sexing in an SIT application, this \nshould not be an issue for medfly, which can be reared at 26 °C. Based on this fact and the promising results from \nthe previous transient knock-down of tra2 in C. capitata\n23, Cctra2 is a good candidate for the construction of a \ntemperature-based sex-conversion system in medfly.\nHence, we used our previously established protocol for markerless CRISPR/Cas9-HDR in medfly yield-\ning high-efficiency  mutagenesis39 to integrate the D. melanogaster tra2 ts1 and tra2ts2 mutations into the Cctra2  \nhomolog. Omitting the use of a fluorescent marker gene should facilitate the use of non-transgenic strains in SIT \nprograms, as CRISPR/Cas9-induced single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) are even considered non-GMO \nin certain  countries\n40.\nResults\nCctra2 mutagenesis: gRNA and repair template design. CRISPR/Cas9 HDR gene editing was used \nto separately re-create the two temperature-sensitive D. melanogaster tra2 mutations (ts1, ts2) in the C. capitata \nhomolog Cctra2 (NCBI Gene ID: 101452698). Positions of the mutations were determined by comparing amino \nacid sequence identity for D. melanogaster and medfly TRA2. The mutated Alanine151 in the Dmel tra2ts1 (Ala-\n151Val)30 corresponds to Ccap Ala158, the Prolin181 of the Dmel tra2ts2 mutation (Pro181Ser) to Ccap Pro188. \nThe ts2 mutation is located in a 19 aa linker region, which is a unique feature of TRA2 and highly conserved \namong  species23,32–36 (Fig. 1a).\nFor both mutations, a single guide RNA (gRNA) and a 140 nt single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN) \nrepair template were designed to introduce the amino acid exchanges corresponding to the Dmel ts1 or ts2 muta-\ntions (ts1: 158 Ala > Val, ts2: 188 Pro > Ser), to create temperature-sensitive versions of the CcTRA2 protein. The \nrepair template ssODN_tra2_ts1 differs from the wild-type tra2 ORF sequence by two bases, a C > T transition \nat position 473 of the CDS to introduce the ts1 SNP and the silent mutation 477 G > A that removes the PAM \nsequence to prevent re-editing. ssODN_tra2_ts2 differs by one base introducing the ts2 SNP (CDS: 562 C > T) \n(Fig. 1b).\nPreliminary gRNA tests to confirm editing capability of tra2ts positions. To assess the func-\ntionality of the tra2 ts1 and tra2 ts2 gRNAs, each was injected complexed with Cas9 protein and either without \n(non-homologous end joining, NHEJ, knock-out) or with repair template (homology-directed repair, HDR, \nknock-in).  G\n0 survivors of these injections were reared at 26 °C. 327 Egypt II wild-type (EgII WT) embryos \nwere injected for tra2_ts1 knock-out. Ten reached adult stage (six males, four females) (Table 1a). One male was \nfertile. The ts1 injection with repair template (290 EgII embryos) yielded four viable but infertile adults (two \nmales, two females), and three adults got stuck in the puparium while eclosing and died (two males, one female) \n(Table 1a). None of the ts1  G\n0 adults showed external phenotypic abnormalities. To check for editing activity of \n3\nVol.:(0123456789)Scientific Reports |        (2020) 10:18611  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-75572-x\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\ngRNA_tra2_ts1, the tra2 genotype of four randomly chosen  G0 flies (two from each injection) was analysed by \nsubcloning the tra2-specific PCR products. One of two knock-out injected  G0 flies showed a 1 bp deletion in \none of five sequenced clones. One of the knock-in injected  G0 flies showed two independent events within five \nsequenced clones, the tra2ts1 HDR genotype or a 6 bp deletion (Supplementary Fig. S1a).\nThe tra2ts2 gRNA knock-out injection yielded six adult males from 367 injected EgII embryos (Table  1b), \nthree of them were fertile. Additionally, three  G0 flies stuck in the puparium did not survive (two males, one \nintersex IS1-KO). The tra2 ts2 knock-in mix was injected into 244 EgII embryos (Table  1b). Eight developed to \nadults (six males, two intersex: IS1, IS2), and four died during eclosing (one male, three intersex: IS3-6). Intersex \nflies showed varying degrees of phenotypically male and female characteristics (genital terminalia apparatus \nand bristles) (Fig. 2a), and were sterile. In contrast, all six  G\n0 males were fertile. The genotype of six ts2   G0 flies \nfrom the knock-out (males M5, M6, and intersex IS1-KO) and knock-in injection (IS1, IS4, IS5) was analysed. \nAll showed NHEJ events ranging from 33 bp deletions to 4 bp insertions (Supplementary Fig. S1b).  G\n1 offspring \nfrom both injections was not analysed.\nThese experiments confirmed the editing activity of the ts1  and ts2 gRNAs. The lack of fertile  G0 in the ts1 \ninjections and the complete lack of females and appearance of intersexes in the ts2 injections, however, indicated \nthat 26 °C is a restrictive temperature for the Cctra2\nts mutations.\nEvaluation of medfly rearing at low temperatures. To evaluate if D. melanogaster and D. suzukii \ntra2ts2 permissive temperatures, 16 °C or 16 to 20 °C,  respectively30,31,38, are applicable to medfly, newly eclosed \nFigure 1.

At 19.5 °C, the number of adult offspring was reduced to about 40%, compared to \n26 °C, and at 18 °C to about 1%. At 16 °C, no larvae hatched from more than 2,000 collected eggs. Hence, 19 °C \nwas chosen as a possible rearing and potential permissive temperature for the subsequent Cctra2\nts injections.\nCRISPR/Cas9‑HDR injections at 19 °C do not produce stable Cctra2ts1 lines. Rearing of ts1-\ninjected  G0 at 19 °C increased the number of adult  G0 survivors to 19.5% compared to 3% and 2.4% for the \nts1 injections at 26  °C (Table  1a). None of them showed external phenotypic abnormalities. Twelve  G0 flies \nwere backcrossed individually to EgII (M5-M10 and F4-F9), remaining flies were backcrossed in three groups \n(M-group I, F-group I, II). After allowing sufficient time for mating and egg laying, all individually crossed  G0 \nflies were dissected to examine their reproductive organs. Phenotypes included females without ovaries (F4), \nonly one ovary (F7), or normal ovaries (F6, F8, F9). Males showed normal reproductive organs, except for M7, \nwhich had no testes (Supplementary Fig. S3a, b). F5 and M10 died and could not be dissected. Overall, 47  G\n1 flies \neclosed from eight fertile families (F6, F8, M6, M8, M9, M10, group M_I and F_II). Since no phenotypic marker \nwas inserted to track successful mutagenesis in  G\n1, non-lethal genotyping was used to analyse  G1 offspring \nreared at 19 °C for the presence of the tra2ts1 mutation. DNA was extracted from a single leg, and the ts1 target \nsite region was PCR-amplified and sequenced. 38 of 47  G1 flies provided sufficient quality sequence information. \nAll showed WT genotype.\nCRISPR/Cas9‑HDR successfully creates inheritable Cctra2ts2 mutation at 19 °C. Rearing of ts2 \nHDR-injected  G0 at 19 °C yielded lower survival numbers than the ts1 HDR injection, but still about twice as \nhigh as the experiments at 26 °C (7.1% compared to 2.4% and 4.9%; Table  1b). Injection of 181 EgII embryos \nresulted in five viable males and six intersex. Additionally, two intersex flies (IS9, IS10) died during eclosing. \nMales and intersex were individually backcrossed to WT virgin females. Eggs were collected every second day \nfor 10 consecutive days (for temperature profile during egg collection see Supplementary Table S1, Fig. S2b). \nTwo of the eleven crosses (M8, M11) produced  G\n1 offspring (Supplementary Table S2). After mating, all alive  G0 \nwere dissected. Males M8, M9, and M11 showed normal testes, while M10 did not have testes (Supplementary \nFig. S3c). Flies with intersex phenotype showed apparently normal ovaries but no spermathecae (IS6), hyper -\ntrophic testes (IS8), miniaturized testes (IS13), or no identifiable reproductive organs (IS7, IS11, IS12; Fig.  2b). \nTo assess the karyotype of all 13  G0 flies, PCR on Y-chromosome-specific repetitive elements was performed, \nwhereby absence of a PCR signal implies a XX-karyotype. None of the intersex phenotype  G0 flies was positive \nfor the Y-chromosome-specific PCR (Fig. 2c), indicating that all XX (female) karyotype  G0 embryos were trans-\nformed to intersex flies. The absence of phenotypically female  G0 in all three tra2 ts2 injections indicates a high \nefficiency of gRNA_tra2_ts2 and the importance of the targeted position for proper TRA2 function in female \nsex development.\nThe tra2 genotype of the  G\n1 flies was analysed via non-lethal genotyping. For family M8, ten of twelve \nanalysed  G1 (83%) were heterozygous for the knock-in genotype (tra2ts2), and two (17%) carried NHEJ events. \nTable 1.

From the  G1 offspring of family M11, 60 \nflies were randomly chosen for genotyping. The heterozygous tra2ts2 genotype was found in 45 flies (75%). This \npercentage was similar in males (26 of 33) and females (19 of 27). Nine flies (15%) were WT and six flies could \nnot be analysed (low DNA quality).\nInbreeding of the ts2 mutation at 19 °C does not produce phenotypic females homozygous for \ntra2ts2. Heterozygous tra2ts2 mutant  G1 flies were either inbred or backcrossed to EgII to ensure the propa-\ngation of the line if inbreeding should turn out to be sterile. Details on crosses, egg collection numbers, and \ntemperature profiles are shown in Supplementary Tables S1, S3, and Fig. S2. Inbreeding of heterozygous M8 \noffspring produced 121  G\n2 flies with a 1:2 female to male ratio (Supplementary Table S3). 27 of 78 phenotypic \n G2 males were homozygous for the ts2 mutation (tra2ts2|ts2), 38 were heterozygous (tra2ts2|WT), and 13 were WT \n(tra2WT|WT, Fig.  3a). In contrast, none of the 38 phenotypic females were homozygous for tra2 ts2, 24 were het-\nerozygous, and 14 had two WT tra2  alleles (Fig.  3a). Inter se crosses of M11 offspring resulted in a similar \nphenotypic female to male ratio as M8 inbreeding (26 and 42, respectively). Non-lethal genotyping showed that \nalso M11 inbreeding produced phenotypic tra2\nts2-homozygous males (21%), but no phenotypic females with \ntwo tra2ts2 alleles (Fig. 3a). Backcross of tra2ts2 heterozygous M11 offspring produced a 1:1 phenotypic sex ratio \n(Supplementary Table S3), which was not further analysed molecularly.\nFigure 2.  Somatic modification of tra2ts2 causes intersexuality with external and internal phenotypic \nabnormalities in  G0.  G0 survivors of tra2ts2 KI injections reared at 26 °C (a) and 19 °C (b) show intersex \nphenotypes with malformed external and internal reproductive organs and mixed male- and female-specific \ncharacteristics. Phenotypes included deformed ovipositors (IS1, IS2), a mixture of male- and female-specific \nbristles on the femur (IS3) or the head (IS8), absent genitalia (IS3), and various degrees of deformed male \ngenitalia, combined with ovaries without spermatheca (IS6), testes-like structures (IS8, IS13) or no identifiable \nreproductive organs (IS11). For comparison, wild-type males have two spatulated bristles on the head, non-\npigmented bristles on the femur, and male genitalia. Wild-type females have no spatulated bristles on the head, \nlong pigmented bristles on the femur, and a prominent ovipositor. Male characteristics are highlighted by blue \narrows, female characteristics by black arrows.

Analysis of tra2ts2 genotypes and phenotypes in  G2. (a) Shown are frequencies of tra2 genotypes \n(homozygous for the WT or the tra2ts2 allele, or heterozygous tra2ts2 mutants) within the number of analyzed \nindividuals (n), found in phenotypic male or female  G2 offspring of family M8 and M11 inbreeding (ib).

(b) Karyotyping of phenotypic  G2 \nmales via Y-chromosome specific PCR (primers P1504/1505) on genomic DNA extracted from a single leg \nof family M8 and M11 offspring. A positive control PCR was performed on tra2 with primers P1532/P1500 \nusing the same DNA samples as in the Y-specific PCR, to exclude lack of PCR product due to DNA quality. \nIndividuals lacking a signal in the Y-chromosome-specific PCRs but not in the genomic control PCR are marked \nin bold letters to indicate the XX-karyotype. M11ib_m29 was excluded from the analysis, due to low DNA \nquality. One phenotypic male (WT m) and female (WT f) from family M8 with WT tra2 genotype are shown \nas controls.

The absence \nof phenotypic females homozygous for the tra2 ts2 mutation in  G2 implied that XX embryos homozygous for \ntra2ts2 are either not viable or transformed into phenotypic males at 19 °C. Y-specific primers were used to assess \nthe karyotype of 35  G2 tra2ts2-homozygous and 60 heterozygous male  G2 flies by PCR. In family M8, nine of 27 \nphenotypic males homozygous for tra2ts2 showed a signal in the control genomic PCR but not in the Y-chromo-\nsome-specific PCR, confirming the transformation of tra2 ts2-homozygous XX flies into phenotypic males. This \nalso applied to two out of eight phenotypic males in family M11 (Fig. 3b). For one M11 offspring, M11ib_m29, \nno statement can be made as the control PCR failed to produce a signal. In contrast, all tra2ts2-heterozygous \nmales were positive for the Y-chromosome-specific PCR (Supplementary Fig. 6), excluding sex conversion as \nreason for the male-biased sex ratio in the  G2 heterozygotes.\nDissection of six XX- and four XY-karyotype males homozygous for tra2ts2, and two XY tra2ts2-heterozygous \nmales (all  G2) showed that all tra2ts2-homozygous males (XX and XY) had apparently normal or slightly decol-\norized testes. The two tra2 ts2-heterozygous males, in contrast, showed severely decolorized testes (Fig.  3c). In \naddition, across the  G2 offspring of both families, M8 and M11, 81.8% of the tra2 ts2 homozygous XX males, \n4.3% of the tra2ts2 homozygous XY males, and 16.6% of the tra2 ts2 heterozygous XY males were not capable to \ncoil and store their distiphallus (Fig.  3c). This phenotype was also observed in random samples of WT flies of \ndifferent ages; while its penetrance in WT is higher at 19 °C (24.8%, n  = 161) than at 26 °C (6.9%, n = 174), it is \nstill markedly lower than observed in the tra2ts2 homozygous XX males (81.8%, n = 11) and might, therefore, be \nalso an effect of the ts2 mutation.\nRearing at lower temperature leads to low fertility rates. Based on the karyotyping experiments, \n19 °C still is a restrictive temperature for the ts2 mutation in Cctra2 , contrary to D. suzukii tra2ts2 where 20 °C \nwas  permissive38. Data from D. melanogaster suggests 16 °C as permissive  temperature30,31. However, medflies \ndo not breed at such low temperatures, as the small-scale fertility tests at 16 °C had shown. To attain a permis-\nsive temperature for the medfly tra2\nts2 mutation that does not affect breeding, the temperature was lowered to \n18.5 °C, the mating threshold  temperature41, for  G2 crossing and egg laying (Supplementary Table S1, Fig. S2c). \nts2-homozygous XX and XY  G2 males were backcrossed to EgII females individually (13 crosses) or in groups \n(two crosses). ts2-heterozygous males and females were inbred (three crosses) or backcrossed (one group). \nOverall, during 13 days and 81 egg collections, more than 8,000 eggs were collected from these 19 crosses (Sup-\nplementary Table S4). A total of five larvae hatched from two egg collections of homozygous tra2\nts2 XY male \ngroup-backcrosses, and only one survived to adulthood (M11ib_m1-het, Supplementary Table S4). Noteworthy, \ndue to technical restrictions the temperature could not be kept constantly at 18.5 °C during the experiment, and \nthese larvae hatched from a late egg collection (383 h; Supplementary Fig. S2c), prior to which the temperature \nhad been above 18.5 °C for about two days. The male  (G\n3) was crossed to 40 EgII females but did not reproduce. \nTherefore, maintaining the ts2 mutant strain by lowering the temperature to a permissive range was not possible.\nDiscussion\nCRISPR/Cas9-HDR gene editing was used to create temperature-sensitive mutations in the C. capitata sex-deter-\nmination gene transformer-2, equivalent to the two chemically induced point mutations in D. melanogaster30,31. \nThe D. melanogaster tra2 ts temperature-dependent sex-conversion phenotype promises great advantages for \ncreating male-only populations needed for SIT programs, as it doubles the amount of male offspring per parental \negg capacity, and only heat is needed for induction. Some countries do not regulate the use of organisms carrying \nCRISPR-induced SNPs as they could have also occurred by natural mutagenesis and selective  breeding\n40,42. Hence, \nonly the trats SNPs, but no exogenous DNA was inserted, to help facilitate a potential field release of Cctra2 ts \nstrains. This was possible due to the high mutagenesis rate achieved with our previously published CRISPR/\nCas9-HDR  protocol\n39, which we now successfully applied for the first time without using a visible phenotype.\nThe injections aiming at creating the tra2ts1 allele did not result in any mutant  G1 offspring at 19 °C, despite \npromising prerequisites; ts1 gRNA and ssODN were functional in the preliminary tests at 26 °C, and the high \nnumber of  G\n0 adult survivors in the 19 °C injection increased the chance to obtain mutant offspring. Moreover,  G0 \nflies showed deformities of internal reproductive organs (Supplementary Fig. 3b). It can’t be excluded, however, \nthat these are the result of physical damage to the embryo caused by the injection. Possible reasons for the poor \nefficiency of the ts1 knock-in could be the low on-target activity score of the ts1 gRNA (0.045), or a stronger \nphenotypic impact of the tra2\nts1 mutation compared to tra2 ts2 as observed in D. melanogaster 30, which could \nreduce the chance to obtain viable ts1 mutant flies. Testing of other ts1 gRNAs could shed more light on possible \nreasons for the failure to create a stable ts1 line; but considering the decreased viability in D. melanogaster and \nthe permissive temperature issues in medfly, these experiments have little prospect for success.\nIn contrast, the tra2\nts2 mutation could be introduced with high efficiency, detectable already from the absence \nof phenotypic females and the appearance of intersexes in  G0, in the frequency of HDR-positive fertile  G0 (100% \nat 19 °C), as well as in the high penetrance of the mutant genotype within their  G1 offspring (83% and 75% knock-\nin for family M8 and M11, respectively). This matches the higher on-target activity score of the ts2 gRNA (0.140).\nThe observed overall higher survival rate of injected  G0 at 19 °C compared to 26 °C might be the result of \na lower Cas9 editing  activity43 and a potentially associated off-target rate, but could also be connected to the \nreduced speed of embryonic development allowing more time for repair mechanisms to fix injection-induced \ndamage to the  embryo\n44, which is unrelated to Cas9 editing. Extensive comparative injections would be needed \nto answer this question.\nThe lack of phenotypic females homozygous for tra2ts2 and the conversion of XX embryos into phenotypic \nmales at 19 °C suggests that this is still a restrictive temperature for the Cctra2ts2 mutation, which does not allow \ncorrect protein folding, and indicates the importance of this position in the highly conserved TRA2 linker region \n8\nVol:.(1234567890)Scientific Reports |        (2020) 10:18611  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-75572-x\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nfor correct protein conformation. This observation is in line with the results obtained for the D. melanogaster \ntra2ts2 mutation, where the temperature had to be lowered to 16 °C to generate fertile males and females, while \n18 °C produced sterile males and females, and 29 °C resulted in sterile males and pseudomale-like  intersexes30. \nA further reduction of the temperature to an average of 18.3 °C, however, resulted in a loss of the strain due to \nmainly unviable eggs deposited by the  G\n2 generation. This was not unexpected since our small-scale tests with \nWT at 18 °C and 16 °C produced very little or no viable offspring, respectively. Furthermore, some males were \nnot capable of coiling and storing their distiphallus. While this phenotype was also observed in WT males at \nlow temperatures, it seems to be enhanced by the tra2  mutant allele. However, the numbers are too small for a \nrobust statement. Fertility and mating behaviour of this phenotype have not been assessed.\nWhile the mean survivorship of medfly egg and larval stages at 15, 20, 25 and 30 °C has been reported to \nnot differ  significantly\n21, and the described threshold for ovarian maturation with 8.1 °C to 16.6 °C21,41,45 is also \nbelow the tested Cctra2 ts2 permissive temperature of 18.3 °C, Prokopy and  Hendrichs41 showed that 18.5 °C is \nthe temperature threshold for mating in medfly. During the cross of tra2 ts2  G2 flies, temperatures were above \nthe threshold mainly during the first days (1–72 h) and last days (337–517 h) of the crossing (Supplementary \nTable S1, Fig. S2c). As ovarian maturation takes up to 10 days at this temperature, and crosses have been set up \nwith 3–5 d old flies, no successful mating could have been achieved during the first period above 18.5 °C. During \nthe main egg collection period (72–336 h), temperature was mainly below 18.5 °C (Supplementary Fig. S2c). The \nsuccessful mating appeared within the second period of exceeded temperature. A possible explanation for the \nloss of the tra2\nts2 strain therefore is that the low temperatures prevented mating and eggs have not been fertilized \nuntil temperatures had exceeded 18.5 °C for at least 2 d. On the other hand, control crosses of EgII flies managed \nto produce a small amount of offspring at temperatures mainly lower than or equal to 18.5 °C (2,796 collected \neggs, 16 larvae, 8 adults; Supplementary Fig. S2c), showing that low mating activity is taking place at or below \nthe threshold. Therefore, it is possible that the ts2  mutation, even in the heterozygous state, affects the fertility \nof the flies at temperatures lower than 18.5 °C. However, as numbers are very small, no robust statement is pos-\nsible. Overall, using the EgII background for the tra2\nts experiments, it could not be determined if the permissive \ntemperature for the medfly tra2ts2 mutation is lower than 18.5 °C or if the ts2 mutant phenotype in medfly is not \ntemperature-dependent at all.\nAs strains with different genetic backgrounds can have markedly different sensitivities for elevated or low \ntemperatures due to adaptation mechanisms, using another medfly WT background might allow to investigate \nlower permissive temperatures for ts2. It might also be possible to induce cold acclimation in a WT strain by \nsuccessively reducing the rearing temperature over several generations before generating the tra2\nts2 mutation. \nThis strategy would fail, however, if there is no acclimation with respect to the mating threshold, as shown for \nB. tryoni46.\nMoreover, with regard to the use of the tra2ts2 mutation for medfly sexing in a mass-rearing facility, the pre-\nsumably low (< 18.5 °C) permissive temperature of the medfly ts2 mutation would be problematic, as temperature \nand development time show a linear relation. At 19 °C, for example, the development from egg to adults takes \nabout 32.7 d plus 9 d for ovarian maturation, compared to 17.4 d plus 5.3 d at 26 °C\n21. The even longer develop-\nment times at < 18 °C would thus be problematic for the production scale and the cost-effectiveness of a mass-\nrearing program and investigations into lower temperatures would thus certainly not be relevant for insect pest \ncontrol applications in medfly.\nIn conclusion, we demonstrated the successful creation of the D. melanogaster tra2\nts2 point mutation in C. \ncapitata via markerless CRISPR/Cas9-HDR gene editing and the importance of the respective amino acid for the \ncorrect function of TRA2 in the female sex-determination. The previously shown high HDR efficiency in medfly \nusing a ssODN repair template to convert the marker gene eGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) into BFP \n(blue), could be confirmed in this study, where we achieved 100% knock-in efficiency (2 out of 2 fertile  G\n0) com-\npared to 86% (6 out of 7 fertile  G0) in the previous  study39. Also, the high penetrance of mutant offspring within \nthe  G1 with 75–83% in this study is similar compared to 90% in the previous one. It was not possible, however, to \nidentify a permissive temperature at which the  tra2ts2 mutation does not affect female development, as it would \nbe located below the mating threshold of medfly. Therefore, it could not be determined if we hadn’t reached the \npermissive temperature yet, or if the tra2\nts2 phenotype in medfly, in contrast to Drosophila,  is not temperature \ndependent. Based on the data presented here, a medfly sexing strain built solely on tra2 ts2 would be unsuitable \nfor an SIT program and mass-rearing, either because the rearing would be too slow to be productive on a large \nscale, or because the sex conversion could not be switched off for strain maintenance. Other possibilities to create \na sex-conversion system in medfly could be to target other sex-determination genes, like transformer\n27,29,47, or to \nforce (over)expression of the maleness factor MoY, which induces masculinization in XX  embryos48. However, \nconditionality would need to be engineered for both options.\nMaterial and methods\nRearing conditions. Ceratitis capitata wild-type Egypt-II (EgII) flies were received from the FAO/IAEA \nAgriculture and Biotechnology Laboratory, Austria, and kept at 26 °C, 48% RH and 14/10 h light/dark cycle. For \nfertility tests, freshly eclosed EgII adult flies were transferred from 26 °C to 19.5 °C, 60% RH, 24 h light or 16 or \n18 °C, 46–48% RH, 24 h light, where egg collections and subsequent rearing took place. tra2\nts mutants were kept \nat 19 °C or 18.5 °C, 60% RH, and 24 h light. Temperature and humidity were measured every five minutes of the \nexperiment using an EL-USB-2 data logger (Lascar electronics, measurement precision for temperature ± 1 °C, \nfor humidity ± 3%). Readout of the data logger showed that during the rearing of the tra2\nts2 mutants, short-term \nvariations of the temperature (+ 3 °C/− 1 °C) occurred (see Supplementary Table S1 and Fig. S2). These could \nnot be avoided due to technical restrictions of the experimental setup. Furthermore, the targeted temperature \n(19 °C) was once exceeded for 3.5 h up to a temperature of 25 °C during an outage of the air conditioning sys-\n9\nVol.:(0123456789)Scientific Reports |        (2020) 10:18611  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-75572-x\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\ntem. This occurred during the late larval or pupal stage of tra2 ts2  G1. Feeding and screening conditions were as \ndescribed in Aumann et al.39.\nCRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. Design of gRNAs targeting tra2  (gRNA_tra2_ts1 and gRNA_tra2_ts2) \nand assessment of potential off-target effects was performed using the C. capitata  genome version Ccap 2.1 \n(GCF_000347755.3, NCBI)49 and the Software Package Geneious  Prime50. On-target activity score was 0.045 for \ngRNA_tra2_ts1, and 0.140 for gRNA_tra2_ts2 (scores are between 0 and 1; 1 = highest expected  activity50). Both \ngRNAs showed zero off-targets sites in the medfly genome. gRNA synthesis, in vitro transcription and purifica-\ntion was performed as described  before39, using primers P_1439 (GAA ATT AAT ACG ACT CAC TAT AGG TGA \nTGA TAT AGC TGA TGC TAG TTT TAG AGC TAG AAA TAGC) and P_369 (GCA  CCG ACT CGG TGC CAC TTT \nTTC AAG TTG ATA ACG GAC TAG CCT TAT TTT AAC TTG CTA TTT CTA GCT CTA AAAC) for gRNA_tra2_ts1 \nand primers P_1440 (GAA ATT AAT ACG ACT CAC TAT AGG CCC ATA TAA ACG CCA GGT GTG TTT TAG AGC \nTAG AAA TAGC) and P_369 for gRNA_tra2_ts2.

Purified Cas9 protein (PNA Bio Inc.) was reconstituted to 1 µg/µl in 20 mM Hepes, 150 mM KCl, \n2% sucrose and 1 mM DTT (pH 7.5).\nMicroinjection of embryos: 10 µl injection mix for knock-out experiments contained 360 ng/µl Cas9 protein \nand 200 ng/µl gRNA_tra2_ts1 or gRNA_tra2_ts2 in 300 mM  KCl\n39,51. For knock-in experiments, 200 ng/µl \nssODN_tra2_ts1 or ssODN_tra2_ts2 were added to the mix. The mixes were freshly prepared on ice, incubated \nat 37 °C for 10 min to allow pre-assembly of gRNA-Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes and stored on ice prior to \ninjections. For microinjection of WT C. capitata embryos, eggs were collected over a 30–50 min period, prepared \nfor injection and handled afterwards as previously  described\n39. Injections were performed using siliconized quartz \nglass needles (Q100-70–7.5; LOT171381; Science Products, Hofheim, Germany), drawn out on a Sutter P-2000 \nlaser-based micropipette puller. Injection equipment consisted of a manual micromanipulator (MN-151, Nar -\nishige), an Eppendorf FemtoJet 4i microinjector, and an Olympus SZX12-TTR microscope (SDF PLAPO 1xPF \nobjective). Injection survivors were numbered successively across ts1 injections and ts2 injections, respectively.\nCrossing strategies and dissection of internal reproductive organs. Crossing of G0: Each  G0 adult \ninjection survivor was individually crossed to three EgII WT males or virgin females, except for the 19 °C ts1 \nknock-in injection. Here, six males and six females were individually backcrossed, the remaining flies were \ngroup-backcrossed (five  G\n0 males to 15 females, ten  G0 females to ten WT males, and six  G0 females to nine \nWT males). Eggs were collected three to five times, with an interval of one to two days. For the 19 °C knock-in \nexperiments,  G1 and  G2 flies (if applicable) were kept individually until their genotype was assessed via non-\nlethal genotyping.\nCrossing of tra2ts2 G1: males and females heterozygous for tra2ts2 were inbred. Additionally, heterozygous males \nwere backcrossed (Supplementary Table S3). Eggs were collected six times, with an interval of one to two days.\nCrossing of tra2ts2 G2: phenotypic males and females heterozygous for tra2 ts2 were inbred (Supplementary \nTable S4). Additionally, four tra2ts2 heterozygous XY males, not capable of coiling and storing their distiphallus, \nwere group backcrossed. tra2 ts2 homozygous XY males were either backcrossed or crossed with heterozygous \ntra2ts2 females (Supplementary Table S4). Nine males homozygous for tra2ts2 with XX-karyotype, all not able to \ncoil and store their distiphallus, were individually backcrossed to four females each. Eggs of the  G2 crosses were \ncollected four to seven times over seven to 13 days (Supplementary Table S4).\nDissections:  G0 flies and single crossed  G2 flies were allowed to mate for 5–10 days  (G0) or 7–13 days  (G2) \ndays. If still alive, they were then dissected to examine their internal reproductive organs.\nMolecular analyses of  G0 mosaics. To analyse the mosaic genotype of  G0 flies, DNA was extracted \nfrom single flies according to a standard protocol. The target region encompassing the ts1 and ts2 mutant sites \n(1213 bp) was amplified using the tra2 -specific primers P1401 (TGC TTG GTG GTC CGC AAA TA) and P1500 \n(TGT GCA TAT ACT AAA GGC TCT CCC ), 50–100  ng DNA, and the Q5 High-fidelity DNA polymerase (New \nEngland Biolabs) according to the manufacturer’s protocol in a Bio-Rad C1000 Touch thermal cycler [98 °C, \n1 min; 35 cycles of (98 °C, 15 s; 56 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 45 s); 72 °C, 2 min]. PCR fragments were purified using the \nZymo Research DNA Clean &  Concentrator-5 kit and subcloned into the pCR4-blunt TOPO vector (Invitrogen) \nfor sequencing. Three to five clones were sequenced using primer mfs13 (TGT AAA ACG ACG GCC AGT ) (Mac-\nrogen Europe, Amsterdam) for each analysed fly. Verification of CRISPR-induced mutations from the sequenc-\ning results was performed using the Software Package Geneious  Prime50 by mapping the sequencing results to \nthe tra2 reference sequence (Gene ID: 101,452,698).\nNon‑lethal genotyping of  G1 and  G2 flies. To identify the tra2 genotype of  G1 and  G2 flies, non-lethal \ngenotyping was performed using an adapted version of the protocol established by Carvalho et al. 52. A single \nleg of an anesthetized fly was cut at the proximal femur using scissors and homogenized in 50 µl buffer (10 mM \nTris–Cl pH 8.2, 1 mM EDTA, 25 mM NaCl) for 15 s (6 m/s) using ceramic beads and a FastPrep-24 5G homog-\nenizer (M.P . Biomedicals). 28.3 µl buffer mixed with 1.7 µl proteinase-K (2.5 U/mg) were added and incubated \nfor 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped 4 min at 98 °C. The solution was cooled down on ice and directly \n10\nVol:.(1234567890)Scientific Reports |        (2020) 10:18611  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-75572-x\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nused as PCR template to amplify the region surrounding the tra2  target site. A 25 µl PCR reaction contained \nDreamTaq polymerase and buffer (Life Technologies), dNTPs and the tra2 -specific primers P1401 and P1500 \naccording to the manufacturer’s instructions, and 3.75 µl template solution in a Bio-Rad C1000 Touch thermal \ncycler [95 °C, 3 min; 35 cycles of (95 °C, 30 s; 56 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 1 min); 72 °C, 5 min]. The size of the PCR \nproduct (1,213 bp) was verified on an agarose gel. PCR products were purified using the Zymo Research DNA \nClean &  Concentrator\n-5 kit, sequenced using primer P1500, and subsequently analysed using Software Package \nGeneious  Prime50.\nMolecular karyotyping‑Y chromosome specific PCR. Y-specific repetitive elements were amplified \nfrom genomic DNA extracted either from a single fly  (G0) or a single leg  (G2) using the published Y-specific oli-\ngonucleotides P1504_Y-spec1 (TAC GCT ACG AAT AAC GAA TTGG) and P1505_Y-spec2 (GCG TTT AAA TAT \nACA AAT GTGTG)53. 10 µl PCR reactions contained either 50 ng DNA (single fly) or 3.75 µl single-leg DNA \ntemplate solution, and the Y-specific primers and DreamTaq PCR components as described above. PCR cycling \nconditions (Bio-Rad C1000 Touch) were [95 °C, 3 min; 35 cycles of (95 °C, 30 s; 58 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 1 min); \n72 °C, 5 min]. Absence of a PCR product was interpreted as absence of the Y chromosome (XX-karyotype). \nThe same PCR conditions with primers P1532 (AGT  GAA AAC GAT TTA AAT CAC ATG CAC) and P1500 for \ngenomic DNA extracted from a single-leg, or P1401 and P1500 for DNA extracted from a single fly were used to \namplify 328 bp or 1,213 bp fragments, respectively of tra2 as a positive control PCR to confirm sufficient quality \nof extracted genomic DNA.\nEquipment and settings for image acquisition. For bright field image acquisition of flies (either dead \nor anesthetized with  CO2 and placed on a 4 °C cooler) was carried out using a fully automated Leica M205FC \nstereo microscope with a PLANAPO 1.0 × objective, a Leica DFC7000 T camera and the Leica LAS X 3.4.2.18368 \nsoftware. To enhance screen and print display of the pictures the image processing software Fiji ImageJ Version \n2.0.0\n54 was used to apply moderate changes to image brightness and contrast. Changes were applied equally \nthroughout the entire image and across all images.\nData availability\nAll data generated or analysed is included in this article or the supplement.\nReceived: 9 June 2020; Accepted: 13 October 2020\nReferences\n 1.
