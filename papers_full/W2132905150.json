Smith, Student Member, IEEE,and Sima Dimitrijev, Member, IEEE\nAbstract—There are many transformer applications where tight\ncoupling is difficult to achieve. Therefore, an analysis of a reso-\nnant converter with a nonideal coupling is required. In this paper,\na forward resonant converter with a coupling ranging from zero to\none was analyzed. It was found that the traditional quasi-resonant\nconverter becomes a multiresonant converter when the coupling\nis less than one. This is because the finite switching time of the\nrectifying diode reduces the input inductance of the transformer\nto effectively give a converter that uses two different inductances\nduring any one switching period. It was also found that, in general,\nthe converter has seven topological states. The design equations are\nderived analytically to provide a fundamental understanding of the\nconverter. The peak voltage and current stress of the power switch\nas a function of the coupling were investigated. It was found that as\nthe coupling is reduced, the peak voltage reduces and the peak cur-\nrent increases. A 48–5-V 20-W forward converter with a coupling\nof 0.9 was designed and tested. A coupling of 0.9 was chosen as it\ngives a duty cycle of 50%, has zero voltage switching for all loads,\nand has a peak switch voltage of 3.3 times the input voltage. The\nexperiment verified the analysis and the practicality of a reduced\ncoupling transformer, and the measured efficiency of the converter\nwas 80%.\nIndex Terms— DC–DC power conversion, equations, resonant\npower conversion, transformers.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nA\nCOMMON goal of transformer designers has been to\nmaximize the coupling. A high coupling is generally\nachieved when the magnetic material has a large permeability,\nwhen the air gaps in the material are kept small, and the\nwindings are in close proximity to the material. Although a\ncoupling of close to one is physically possible, it is becoming\na more difficult task as converter frequencies increase. This is\nmainly because high frequency power magnetics have a lower\npermeability and the relative number of turns is decreasing.\nTherefore, a more complete analysis of a converter that includes\nthe effects of coupling is required.\nFor the traditional analysis of resonant [1] and multiresonant\n[2]–[4] forward converters it is often convenient to model the\ntransformer magnetizing inductance as a current source. This is\nonly accurate if the magnetizing inductance is much larger than\nthe leakage inductance, that is, if the transformer coupling is\nclose to unity. Another common analysis assumption is that the\nManuscript received July 17, 1998; revised May 5, 1999. This work was sup-\nported by the Australian Research Council.

This can be valid from a\nsemiconductor point of view, but it is only accurate if the sec-\nondary leakage inductance is relatively small. This is because\nthe rate of change of the rectifying diode current is governed by\nthe secondary leakage inductance. Therefore, both of these as-\nsumptions cannot be used if the effects of transformer coupling\nare to be investigated.\nQuasi-resonant converters use one inductor and one capacitor\nto achieve one resonant frequency [1]. The common multireso-\nnant converter [2]–[4] uses one inductor and two capacitors to\ngive more than one resonant frequency. This paper introduces\nthe concept that a quasi-resonant forward converter actually be-\ncomes a multiresonant forward converter when the transformer\ncoupling is less than one. This new converter uses one capacitor\nand effectively two inductors. The main advantage of this is that\nthe nonideal coupling of a transformer can be exploited to give\na very simple converter with a minimum parts count. The trans-\nformer can be less expensive and easier to construct, and the\nvoltage stress on the switch can be reduced when compared to\na quasi-resonant converter that has a wide load range. A typical\nquasi-resonant converter has a voltage stress that is proportional\nto the load range. For example, a fixed load can have a peak\nvoltage as low as two times the input voltage, but a load range of\n7 : 1 gives a peak voltage of eight times the input voltage [1]. A\nlower peak resonant voltage permits the use of a MOSFET with\na lower on resistance or input capacitance, which is important\nfor higher efficiency and simplified drive circuitry, respectively.\nThis paper presents a multiresonant forward converter with a\nnonideal coupling and an experimental 48–5-V 20-W converter\nis designed and tested to confirm its practicality.\nII. T\nHEORY OF O PERATION\nFig. 1 shows a typical quasi-resonant forward converter\nwhere the transformer consists of two coupled inductors, the\nprimary inductance () and the secondary inductance ().\nFig. 2(a) shows this transformer as a four terminal device.\nFig. 2(b) shows an equivalent model of Fig. 2(a), derived from\n[5], which includes the transformer coupling (\n).

Therefore, there will be two dif-\nferent values of inductance resonating with the effective reso-\nnant capacitance (\n) during any one switching period. This\ngives rise to a multiresonant converter with two resonant fre-\nquencies of and , referred to\nas and , respectively.can consist of an external capac-\nitance in parallel with the output capacitance of the switch.\nIn general, there are seven states of operation for the con-\nverter. Fig. 3(a) shows the first five states for the voltage across\nthe capacitor (), the current through the primary inductance\nand the current through the rectifying diode. Fig. 3(b) and (c)\nshows the options for states six and seven. Fig. 4 is a flowchart\nof the seven states. It indicates the condition to enter a new state\nand whether the state is nonresonant or resonant at\nor .\nA steady-state description of the converter, with reference to\nFigs. 3 and 4, is as follows. In state 1 the switch is on,is fully\non, equals and has a linearly increasing current\n( ) . The switch then turns off and the first resonant state,\nstate 2, begins. is still fully on so the resonant frequency\nis . Another resonant state, state 3, begins when\nstarts to turn off. This occurs when the voltage across the\nswitch ( ) equals the input voltage (). Here, the resonant\nfrequency is . The smaller equivalent in-\nductance during this state lowers the peak resonant voltage when\ncompared to a quasi-resonant converter. The next resonant state,\nstate 4, begins when\nis fully off, is now fully on and\nsupplying the load current (). Since is fully off the reso-\nnant frequency here is .

The\noutput voltage is regulated for lighter loads by decreasing the on\ntime of the switch.\nSMITH AND DIMITRIJEV: ANALYSIS OF A MULTIRESONANT FORW ARD CONVERTER 113\nFig. 4. Flowchart showing the sequence of states.\nThe turn-on and turn-off times ofeach introduce a new\nstate. This transforms the quasi-resonant converter into a mul-\ntiresonant converter. As\nbecomes smaller, these two new states\nbecome more pronounced by occupying a larger percentage of\nthe off time.\nIII. ANALYSIS\nIn general, the converter has seven states of operation. How-\never, in this particular design, maximum power for the converter\nwill require five states only, i.e., no states 6 or 7, and can be seen\nin Fig. 3(a). States 6 and 7 will then exist when the output power\nis decreased from its maximum, i.e., when the load is reduced.\nDesigning for maximum power using either six or seven states\nis also possible and will be studied in a future paper.\nTo simplify the analysis in the Appendix, a 100% efficient\nconverter was assumed. Some of the more common sources of\npower loss that were not included in the ideal analysis are copper\nac/dc resistances, magnetic hysteresis and eddy currents, diode\nvoltage drop,\n, and capacitor dielectrics.\nThe following equations for, , and are derived in\nthe Appendix and refers to the maximum output current:\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\nFig. 5. Plots of/102 ,/102 , and/102 as universal functions of/107 .\nwhere , , and are universal functions ofonly, and are\nplotted in Fig. 5.\nEquations for maximum output power () can be derived\nfrom these equations, from (1) and (3)\n(4)\nwhere is the characteristic impedance ,\n, and .\nSince the analysis assumed a 100% efficient converter then\nmust equal the input power (). is the input impedance\nof the converter, from (4)\n(5)\nwhere\nTherefore, the input impedance of the converter is simply the\ncharacteristic impedance multiplied by some function of.I t\nis interesting to note thatequals one when equals 0.9.\nSince is proportional tothen is inversely propor-\ntional to. Therefore,effectively increases and decreases\nwhen is less than or greater than 0.9, respectively.\nThe voltage ratio ( ) can also be derived, from (1) and\n(2)\n(6)\nwhere .\nTherefore, the voltage ratio is simply the turns ratio multi-\nplied by some function of. Since is proportional to\nthen the voltage ratio is proportional to. It is interesting to\nnote that equals one when equals one. This is not phys-\nically possible since aof one also implies a duty cycle of one.\nTherefore, the voltage ratio will always be less than the turns\nratio, as in the original nonresonant forward converter [6]. In\n114 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS, VOL. 15, NO. 1, JANUARY 2000\nFig. 6. The peak switch current and voltage as a function of/107 .\nthis case, the voltage ratio equals the turns ratio multiplied by\nthe duty cycle as in (7)\n(7)\nIt is interesting to do a comparison of the new multiresonant\nforward converter with the original nonresonant one. It is stated\nin the Appendix that the time for each state can be expressed as\nfunctions of the on time and\n. Therefore, the duty cycle (),\nwhich is a function of the state times, can be expressed purely\nas a function of\n. When this is done it is found that it equals\nexactly twice . From (6)\n(8)\nwhere\nTherefore, the new multiresonant voltage ratio is the same as the\noriginal one, but multiplied by some function of. equals\none when equals one and decreases to 0.707 whenequals\nzero. Therefore, the new voltage ratio will always be less than\nthe original one.\nIt appears then that the multiresonant converter presented in\nthis paper has the same equations as the traditional nonresonant\nconverters except that they are all multiplied by universal func-\ntions of\n.\nIV . EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION\nTo investigate the effects of, the circuit of Fig. 1 was de-\nsigned for a 48–5-V 20-W converter with an on time of 0.5\nµs. The theoretical peak switch voltage and peak switch cur-\nrent were found as a function of\nand are shown in Fig. 6.\nIt can be seen that a tradeoff between voltage stress and cur-\nrent stress exists, minimum current means maximum voltage,\nand vice versa. An optimum value of\nwould depend solely on\nthe application of the converter, and the relative effects for the\nwhole system must be addressed. For example, loweringcan\nlower the voltage stress on a MOSFET which in turn permits\nthe use of a MOSFET with a lower on resistance (). This\nwould reduce the loss. However, according to Fig. 6, the\npeak current stress is increased. This would increase the\nloss. Other tradeoffs are also present, ifis reduced then the\nrequired value of is reduced and that ofand are in-\ncreased. Therefore, if the reduction in parasitic resistance of\nis more substantial than the increase fromand then the\ntotal loss would be lower.\nFrom Fig. 6, it can be seen that ifis chosen to be approx-\nimately at the knee of the peak voltage curve, then at the ex-\npense of a slight increase in peak current, the peak voltage can\nbe dramatically reduced. A\nof 0.9 was chosen to practically\ndemonstrate the new multiresonant technique because it is near\nthe knee and also corresponds to a duty cycle of 50%. The duty\ncycle equals 50% when\nequals 0.25, from Fig. 5 this occurs\nwhen is 0.9.\nEquations (1)–(3) were used to design a 48–5-V 20-W\nconverter. , , and were found to be 14.4µH, 0.7µH,\nand 1.2 nF, respectively. The analytical expressions for the\nwaveforms from the Appendix were programmed in MATLAB\nand compared to a lossless circuit in PSPICE and an accurate\nmatch was found. The circuit was then built and all waveforms\nmatched the theory accurately except that\nwas only 4.2 V .\nThe on time could be increased from 0.5µs to increase to\n5 V , but this increased the duty cycle and peak waveforms by\napproximately 50%. It was then found that the main reason for\nbeing 4.2 V instead of 5 V was because of the diode voltage\ndrop. This voltage drop needed to be included in the analysis to\nimprove the accuracy and hence the practicality of the design\nequations. A method to include the voltage drop in the analysis\nwithout compromising its simplicity, is to add the forward\nvoltage, in this case approximately 1 V , to that required at the\noutput while retaining the original output current. Therefore, a\n48–5-V 20-W requirement means that a 48–6-V 24-W design\nshould be implemented. This method increases the peak current\nSMITH AND DIMITRIJEV: ANALYSIS OF A MULTIRESONANT FORW ARD CONVERTER 115\nFig. 7. Measured drain-to-source voltage and the primary current for an output\nof 20 W.\nslightly and the peak voltage remains the same. Fig. 6 is\nactually generated from a 48–6-V 24-W design.\nUsing (1)–(3) for a 48–6-V 24-W converter the circuit\nof Fig. 1 was redesigned and built using an IRF620 as the\nMOSFET. was a 1.3-nF capacitor in parallel with the\nIRF620. was 12.0µH, was 0.85µH, and was 0.9. The\nprimary and secondary windings on a toroid were separated\nuntil a coupling of 0.9 was achieved. Lower coupling trans-\nformers can also be built by adding tuning inductors in series\nwith the primary and secondary.\nFig. 7 shows the measured drain-to-source voltage (\n),\nwhich is the same as , and the primary current (). The\npractical and theoretical comparison of peak voltage, peak\ncurrent and duty cycle matched exactly at 158 V , 2 A, and 50%,\nrespectively. However, the on time was approximately 10%\ngreater than predicted, and therefore, the switching frequency\nwas 10% lower then predicted. It should be noted that the\nrise and fall times of the MOSFET gate voltage were each\napproximately 50 ns which leads to inaccuracies between the\ntheoretical and practical on time. The on time can be increased\nor decreased slightly to compensate for inaccuracies and\nparasitics in the circuit. The efficiency was measured at 80%.\nMany converters require the output voltage to be regulated\nfrom full load to zero load. Regulation for lighter loads is\nachieved by decreasing the on time. ZVS might not always be\nachieved because reducing the on time also reduces the current,\nand hence energy, in the primary and secondary inductances\nprior to switching. A simple program utilizing the equations\nfrom the Appendix was implemented to investigate whether\nZVS and output voltage regulation can be obtained for lighter\nloads. This was done by reducing the on time for each load\nuntil ZVS was just achieved. This gives the minimum output\nvoltage where ZVS is still achieved. Fig. 8 shows this minimum\nvoltage for couplings of 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, and 0.6. The figure shows\nthat ZVS, or near ZVS, can be achieved for all loads when\ncoupling is 0.9. Also observed from the figure is that ZVS, or\nnear ZVS, for lighter loads becomes impossible as coupling\ndecreases below 0.8. This does not necessarily mean that the\noutput cannot be regulated, but the efficiency would decrease.\nIt should be noted that the theoretical curves near zero load\nFig. 8.

Measured drain-to-source voltage and the primary current for an output\nof 2.5 mW.\nmay not be achievable because these require an on time which\nis practically too small.\nZVS and an output voltage of 5 V was obtainable for all loads.\nFig. 9 shows the measured and for an output power as\nlow as 2.5 mW.\nV. CONCLUSION\nConverter frequencies are increasing to facilitate size re-\nduction and improved efficiency. As a result, obtaining near\nideal transformer coupling is becoming increasingly difficult.\nA power supply that benefits from leakage inductances is\nrequired. In analyzing a forward converter with nonideal\ncoupling, it was recognized that the magnetizing inductance\nshould not be modeled with a current source, nor should it be\nassumed that the rectifying diode is switched instantaneously.\nWhen coupling is included in the analysis it is found that a\nquasi-resonant converter becomes a multiresonant converter\nwhich generally has seven states. The converter becomes mul-\ntiresonant because there are effectively two inductors and one\ncapacitor in any one switching period as opposed to the more\ncommon one inductor and two capacitors. The benefits of this\nare that the nonidealities of the transformer can be exploited\nand the peak voltage stress on the power switch can be reduced\n116 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS, VOL. 15, NO. 1, JANUARY 2000\nat the expense of a slight increase in the peak current. An\nexperimental 48–5-V 20-W forward converter was designed\nand tested.

These four equations will contain four unknowns, ,\n, and .\nThe design uses zero voltage switching and zero current\nswitching at the maximum output power as a boundary con-\ndition. Therefore, when equals zero then equals zero\nand equals .\n7) Equations for : To make equal zero when\nequals zero means that the minimum ofequals zero. This\nmeans that the peak ac voltage plus the dc voltage has to equal\nzero. It should be noted that if the output power is increased\nbeyond the design limit then ZVS will no longer be possible.\nFrom (A12)\n(A47)\nThe boundary condition for maximum power is that the peak\nac voltage equals the dc voltage. Therefore, the time for state 5\nis actually one quarter of the period of the appropriate resonant\nfrequency. The resonant frequency of state 5 is\n. That is,\n(A48)\nequals when equals zero is also a boundary con-\ndition at maximum power. Therefore, sinceis the time for\nto go from zero tothen must also be one quarter of\nthe period.
