In power supply systems the change in the magnitude of the voltage degrades the operation of \nelectrical appliances right up to their f ailure. The proposed scheme of a contactless voltage relay based on a \ncontactless voltage relay with switching the windings of a booster step -up transformer with a time delay \nallows switching the windings of a magnetizing booster transformer with a voltage  change at the consumer \nterminals. Analytical studies of a non -autonomous non -linear dynamic circuit, which is the basis of the \nproposed device based on the classical method of solving a differential equation, which determines the \nnature of the voltage cha nge for controlling thruster switches. The change of energy parameters of the \nproposed stabilizer depending on the voltage is given. The article considers the principle of operation of the \nproposed scheme of a contactless switching device based on a contac tless voltage relay that switches the \nwindings of a booster step -up transformer. An analytical study of a non -autonomous nonlinear dynamic \ncircuit, which is the basis of the proposed device and the characteristics required for switching \nthe thruster is presented. \nOne of the important indicators of the quality of \nelectricity is the stability of the current voltage value. \nUsing special technical means of regulation namely \ntransformers with voltage regulation under load or step -\nup transformers it is possible to improve the quality of \nthe voltage. In this case, it is necessary to change the \nnumber of turns the primary windings of the transformer \nor switch the magnetizing windings of the amplifier \namplifier transformers. For this purpose we propose to \nuse contactless voltage relays based on resistive \nnonlinear circuits [1-3]. \nConsider the circuit (Fig.1) of the proposed \ncontactless switching device based on an optoelectronic \nvoltage relay. The device consists of two proximity \nrelays. The first (I) relay is used to turn on the voltage \nboost transformer (BT) winding. The second (II) relay \nserves to disconnect the winding of the boost \ntransformer. \nThe proposed circuit works as follows: when the \ninput voltage is reduced the first relay is activated and a \ncontrol signal is applied to open the power thruster, \nwhich turns o n the winding of the boost transformer in \nthe network. With a further increase in the input voltage, \nthe second voltage relay is triggered by shunting the \noptocoupler diode circuit of the first relay with its \nthruster optocoupler circuit terminating the ac cess of the \ncontrol signal to the power thruster; such tripping of the \npower thruster is still achieved as soon as the load \ncurrent passes through zero, thereby discon -necting the \nboost coil transformer [4-5]. \n \nFig.1.

Also on the output side there are optocouplers VU, \ndiode bridge VD2-VD5 and, load Zload (Fig.2) [6-7, 9]. \n \nFig.2. Non-autonomous non-linear dynamic circuit \n \nCurrently, various methods of analysis of such chains \nare widely used. For a theoretical analysis the equation \nof state of the circuit shown in Fig.2, it is proposed to \nuse the numerical Euler method.  In this case it is \nnecessary to determine an approximate solution of the \nequation on a certain interval [6, 12]. \n                            (1) \nDenote by: \n    (2) \nFrom expression (2), each point  is replaced \nby the differences in the relations of the derivative, then: \n                              (3) \nIn the first section,  and , hence \n                          (4) \nFrom (4) it is known , then: \n                         (5) \nAt t=t, from equation (3) we get: \n                              (5*) \nFrom here, \n                         (6) \nThen, \n                         (7) \nFor the remaining sections of the equation is written \nsimilarly, \n                        (8) \n               (8*) \nThus, we determine the approximate values of the \npoints  of the function “y” connecting these \npoints, we obtain linear Euler curves. \nWe analyze this chain u sing the classical method [1, \n12]. We take the characteristic of the diode as ideal and \nassume that . Then from the moment  to \n the diode is open and the circuit equation has the \nfollowing form: \n,                    (9) \nGiven that  we have: \n            (10) \nFrom here, \n          (11) \nEquation (11) is solved by the numerical Euler method \n            (12) \nFrom here, \nf(     (13) \nHere  h - is the integration step. \nUntil t , the voltage across the capacitance is \ndetermined by (12), taking into account the initial \nconditions. From the moment t  the diode opens and \nuntil the moment  the voltage on the capacitor remains \nat the voltage level for the moment , the voltage on the \ncapacitor remains at the voltage level for the moment , \nfrom the moment  the d iode opens again and the \nvoltage on the capacitance is again described by \ndependences (12) with other initial condition. \nFigure 3-5 shows the curves of the voltage across the \ncapacitance for various values of the circuit parameters \nat  and the integration step h=0,001 [11-12]. \n \nFig.3.
